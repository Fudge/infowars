[00:00:01.027 --> 00:00:14.391]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:19.352]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.213]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.213 --> 00:00:23.953]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:23.953 --> 00:00:25.894]  Well so does he.
[00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:44.066]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us as we kick off another global transmission on this Monday, the 17th day already of July 2017.
[00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:50.188]  Remember this headline from November 5th, 2016?
[00:00:50.188 --> 00:00:55.810]  Madam President Newsweek printed up hundreds of thousands of Madam Presidents.
[00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.951]  You can still buy one for like $3 on eBay.
[00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:01.452]  Hillary Clinton's historic journey to the White House.
[00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:09.592]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, President Trump really has a 65% approval rating.
[00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:11.673]  They claim it's 37% right now.
[00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:15.156]  We also have mobs of youth attacking police for no reason.
[00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:16.658]  That video is coming up today.
[00:01:16.658 --> 00:01:18.159]  It's all key intel.
[00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:26.406]  But first, remembering Dr. Michael Kaufman, who I just learned last night died a month ago, a great patriot who first exposed Jena 21.
[00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:26.666]  Without him,
[00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:37.591]  Right now, we would be up the creek without a paddle, but because of his key seminal work, the sleeping giant is awake.
[00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:48.294]  Basically, back in the early 1990s, I was leading a multi-million dollar research effort on global warming, contacting and working with scientists all over the world.
[00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:57.157]  And it became pretty obvious to me that by 1992 that, well actually in the early 1990s, that man probably wasn't causing global warming.
[00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:57.817]  We have now
[00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:02.198]  Overwhelming evidence that man is not causing global warming.
[00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:10.880]  And that's why I think they're ramping up this hype and scare story that Hurricane Sandy was caused by global warming and so forth.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.222]  But nonetheless, at that particular point in time, I was also following what was going on in an organization called the IUC, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
[00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:30.208]  Now, some of you probably know this because you've heard me before, but most of our international treaties are written by the IUCN, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
[00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:33.570]  The Convention on Biological Diversity is one of those.
[00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:41.695]  And at the same time, there was another project called the Wildlands Project, which was basically also coming out of the United Nations.
[00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:49.520]  The Wildlands Project called for setting aside 50% of the United States into wilderness, as you suggested just a few minutes ago.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.340]  We're good.
[00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:07.547]  All the language was there.
[00:03:07.547 --> 00:03:09.007]  It was really sanitized.
[00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:10.048]  You couldn't really see it.
[00:03:10.048 --> 00:03:12.308]  It sounded like motherhood and apple pie.
[00:03:12.308 --> 00:03:19.691]  But when the Global Biodiversity Assessment was published, it was actually written by the IUCN and the World Resources Institute.
[00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:28.475]  When that was published by the UN, it was basically referred back to the Wildlands Project and named the authors and so forth in doing that.
[00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:39.541]  I had been in August of 1994 down to the Senate trying to convince them that the Wildlands Project wasn't the heart of the convention or the treaty.
[00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:43.104]  They ignored me because it didn't say anything in the treaty about it.
[00:03:43.104 --> 00:03:48.727]  When the Global Biodiversity Assessment came out a month or two later, it was still in draft form.
[00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:50.248]  We didn't have the actual copy.
[00:03:50.248 --> 00:03:51.949]  That wasn't going to be published until the end of 1994.
[00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.256]  But we had a draft copy and in it it specifically said the Wildlands Project.
[00:03:58.256 --> 00:03:59.478]  It was a smoking gun.
[00:03:59.478 --> 00:04:03.342]  I had been doing, actually drawing maps for two years.
[00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:04.864]  I don't know why I was drawing them.
[00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:06.847]  I just really felt compelled by God to do it.
[00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.028]  I didn't have any idea why.
[00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.371]  It was a lot of work, but nonetheless, I did.
[00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:18.595]  And when that treaty, when the draft of the GPA came out, I sent it down, FedExed it down to the U.S.
[00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:20.276]  Senate, along with a map.
[00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.318]  There was actually a couple of us working on it at the time.
[00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:28.561]  And that map was blown up into a 4 by 6 foot poster, taken out of the Senate floor at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:32.403]  The closure vote was scheduled for 4 o'clock on September 29th.
[00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:36.266]  And it just literally died on the vine.
[00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:40.069]  Mitchell, Senator Mitchell, the majority leader at the time, just took it right off the exacting calendar.
[00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.570]  It was never voted on.
[00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.494]  But that's how close we came to having this actually passed and ratified by the Senate.
[00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:53.019]  And as you said, very accurately, it's now the marching orders of the U.S.
[00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:57.182]  government and every federal agency through a document called Sustainable America.
[00:04:57.702 --> 00:04:59.329]  Alright folks, we'll be right back.
[00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:03.425]  He was the first to discover all this, and again, we are now winning.
[00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:06.007]  All right, so let me get this straight.
[00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:18.415]  Hillary Clinton, when accused of using her private email server to send out classified information, immediately deleted her emails and physically smashed her hard drives.
[00:05:18.415 --> 00:05:24.679]  Yet liberal logic says she's innocent and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing.
[00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:26.620]  And now Donald Trump Jr.
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.002]  is accused of breaking campaign laws.
[00:05:29.302 --> 00:05:36.211]  Because he had an email exchange and a meeting with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton.
[00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.473]  Donald Trump Jr.
[00:05:37.473 --> 00:05:41.859]  immediately published his emails, which showed no wrongdoing.
[00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:44.322]  Yet liberal logic says he's guilty.
[00:05:44.482 --> 00:05:48.624]  They haven't found the exact law yet, but he's got to be guilty of something, right?
[00:05:48.624 --> 00:05:54.426]  After all, he is the son of Donald Trump, and there must be a Russian conspiracy.
[00:05:54.426 --> 00:05:55.326]  But wait a minute!
[00:05:55.326 --> 00:06:00.989]  It turns out that the Russian lawyer has deep state connections to all things anti-Trump.
[00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:03.450]  You can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[00:06:05.504 --> 00:06:09.267]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:17.012]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:17.012 --> 00:06:25.617]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:30.040]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.384]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:06:35.464 --> 00:06:36.744]  We're good to go.
[00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:08.247]  Enjoy all natural bath and beauty products with Emmerich's Essentials.

[00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:18.036]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:08:18.036 --> 00:08:21.878]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.698 --> 00:08:28.019]  And we are go!
[00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:30.902]  Another global transmission is airborne.
[00:08:30.902 --> 00:08:32.444]  And we're going stratospheric.
[00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:34.065]  We're going intergalactic.
[00:08:34.065 --> 00:08:35.967]  We're going interstellar.
[00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:41.112]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, the 17th day of July 2017.
[00:08:41.112 --> 00:08:44.755]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:44.755 --> 00:08:46.918]  I'm extremely honored to be here with you today.
[00:08:46.918 --> 00:08:48.139]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:09:10.352]  I've got a lot of guests and a ton of big news breaking, but I was sitting there this morning thinking and I thought, I need to lead the broadcast and have it basically be a thematic discussion to really wake people up on two big issues that intertwine and intersect together.
[00:09:10.352 --> 00:09:16.435]  And if you understand these two intertwined issues, you understand it all.
[00:09:16.435 --> 00:09:18.937]  Presidential daily tracking poll.
[00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:23.738]  Has Rasmussen with the president at 43.
[00:09:23.738 --> 00:09:27.059]  Gallop housing at 47.
[00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:37.503]  If you then take out the 40-something percent that didn't vote in 2016, you can argue that only 36% of the country supports Trump.
[00:09:37.503 --> 00:09:48.047]  And we're seeing baiting going on by Psycho Joe and his fiancee on the morning show trying to bait
[00:09:49.451 --> 00:09:56.738]  The President back into talking about them to make them relevant.
[00:09:56.738 --> 00:10:01.923]  You've got Breitbart coming out and saying that the globalists are panicking.
[00:10:01.923 --> 00:10:10.511]  Morning Joe revives President Bannon's smear as nationalism gains traction in the White House.
[00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:13.053]  That is being reported by the New York Times, the Washington Post.
[00:10:13.053 --> 00:10:14.455]  But we told you two months ago
[00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:28.818]  Patriots, nationalists, conservatives, free marketeers, people that like prosperity, folks that don't want to live in North Korea, just common sense, non-suicidal, non-destructive types, positive types.
[00:10:30.134 --> 00:10:31.715]  ...are gonna really like what Trump does.
[00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:35.276]  The first 70 days, he went pure hardcore Americana.
[00:10:35.276 --> 00:10:41.559]  He then compromised a little bit, believed the Republicans that they would carry out a good agenda if he acquiesced.
[00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:43.340]  They stabbed him in the back.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:52.944]  About two months ago, at about day 100, he made a hardcore libertarian patriot turn, even more hardcore than he'd been during the campaign.
[00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:56.586]  He dug his heels in.
[00:10:56.586 --> 00:10:59.507]  They responded as I predicted they would.
[00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:10.299]  Almost nine months after they got caught doing it last time, coming in with fake polls.
[00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:12.821]  Fake polls.
[00:11:12.821 --> 00:11:15.182]  Now how do I know these polls are fake?
[00:11:15.182 --> 00:11:20.506]  Because I've done the research and I've talked to the folks that head up the different polling agencies.
[00:11:20.506 --> 00:11:25.209]  In 2016, you couldn't pay for an honest poll on Trump.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:42.804]  It was the first time in modern history that all the major polling companies, including liberal and historically conservative polling companies, would not give you a fair poll because the Democrats were spending so much money paying for fake polls they bought up the market.
[00:11:42.804 --> 00:11:54.427]  And the Republican establishment promised to go along with this lie and did not expose the polling agencies because the Never Trumpers, the Blue Bloods, the Neocons, the RINOs, wanted Trump defeated so badly.
[00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:18.696]  And I came out and I laid out the facts from scientific bots and Google bots and Bloomberg bots, and by bots, that's spiders, crawling data across the web, giving major corporations the heads-up view that Trump was 10 to 20 points, depending on what time he was in the campaign, what period, ahead of Hillary.
[00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:22.720]  That's why they were panicking, saying she was invincible, saying she was going to win.
[00:12:23.837 --> 00:12:27.580]  I guess they must have watched, you know, too many Oprah Winfrey shows about the secret.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:35.507]  That's why they printed up Newsweek by the hundreds of thousands saying, Madam President, and that she had been elected days before.
[00:12:35.507 --> 00:12:41.572]  But they didn't print up that Trump had been elected days before, because they believe their own lie.
[00:12:41.572 --> 00:12:50.240]  They saw, after the RNC in July, Trump with 20 points or more in major scientific internal polls.
[00:12:51.775 --> 00:12:55.519]  The lowest he ever got was 10 points ahead of her.
[00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.901]  And I told you that over and over again.
[00:12:57.901 --> 00:13:06.730]  But I said just like she stole it from Sanders and stole the nomination and then stole many states from Trump, they were going to try to steal
[00:13:07.714 --> 00:13:10.536]  The electors and make them faithless electors.
[00:13:10.536 --> 00:13:13.698]  They then came out and said that's a hoax by Alex Jones.
[00:13:13.698 --> 00:13:18.642]  Nobody's planning to try to get electors to not seek the president in the Electoral College.
[00:13:18.642 --> 00:13:27.548]  Nancy Pelosi went to Homeland Security and the Justice Department and asked for me to be arrested for death threats which I hadn't made.
[00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:30.030]  I got that from two different sources.
[00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:34.524]  Folks that question Larry Nichols was one of the sources.
[00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:36.246]  I got another source telling me that.
[00:13:36.246 --> 00:13:45.819]  The next day, Pelosi's daughter goes on Fox and says that I've been having people threaten her that they want me arrested.
[00:13:45.819 --> 00:13:48.062]  When she was running the faithless elector operation.
[00:13:49.673 --> 00:13:51.975]  They tried all these mind games.
[00:13:51.975 --> 00:13:53.816]  They knew that she was behind.
[00:13:53.816 --> 00:13:55.397]  They stole five states.
[00:13:55.397 --> 00:13:57.419]  They tried to steal six.
[00:13:57.419 --> 00:14:09.707]  You've got the heads of six state election agencies coming out saying, no, Homeland Security, the Democrats were breaking in, trying to flip the votes in live time in key battleground states, but they failed.
[00:14:09.707 --> 00:14:10.308]  They failed.
[00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:21.089]  Trump then said that as many as three and a half million illegals voted according to intel he had that was from Pew Research and Mason Dixon University.
[00:14:21.089 --> 00:14:23.012]  New data came out from Harvard a month ago.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:43.954]  The data shows from the sample 5.7 million, according to the algorithm, with the sample of 10,000 from registered voters that Harvard got, they then indexed it and said that would be 5.7 million people voting in the name of dead people and illegals voting.
[00:14:43.954 --> 00:14:48.137]  And now 48 states are refusing to give over the voter data.
[00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:50.539]  So, people are asking,
[00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.996]  We see these polls of Trump at 46, 45, 43.
[00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:08.764]  But you hear Democrats call in saying, every Democrat I know sees their 401k up, sees more business in their restaurant, sees more business in their store, sees their orders up.
[00:15:08.764 --> 00:15:20.813]  Every Democrat that has a job is pro-Trump now because they understand we're trying to bring back prosperity and a system that gives us a prosperous free market economy.
[00:15:20.813 --> 00:15:25.657]  So what happened during the campaign and what's happening now?
[00:15:25.657 --> 00:15:26.378]  Here it is today.
[00:15:27.816 --> 00:15:34.141]  Rasmussen Daily Presidential Tracking Poll shows him at 43 with 57% disapproving.
[00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:39.765]  Now they do that in the demographics by who they target, who they call, who they get to respond.
[00:15:41.172 --> 00:15:51.617]  But also by oversampling, you can read again in Rasmussen and in the others, they always add, this one it's nine points, in others they add even more.
[00:15:51.617 --> 00:16:03.283]  So what they do is they disparage it, claiming Democrats are a larger percentage of the population, so they add into the equation, artificially, nine points against the President.
[00:16:03.283 --> 00:16:05.124]  Now on average it's about 15 points.
[00:16:06.789 --> 00:16:23.518]  And you look at the different polls they had during the campaign, where they would add 30 plus points in phone polls, they would add 30 plus percent more Democrats to who they took polls from in the demographics, claiming that was, quote, fair.
[00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:26.700]  Well, of course, Hillary was then 20 points ahead in those polls.
[00:16:29.761 --> 00:16:44.182]  That's the arrogance of these people running this crone-like witch on the whole idea that, well, she's a woman, so we'll be able to force this establishment sea hag on the population.
[00:16:44.182 --> 00:16:44.903]  Now, continuing.
[00:16:47.042 --> 00:16:47.923]  Globalist panic.
[00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:54.329]  Morning Joe revives President Bannon's smear as nationalism gains traction in the White House.
[00:16:54.329 --> 00:16:58.092]  And it goes over the fact that what we told you months ago is indeed the fact.
[00:16:58.092 --> 00:17:08.962]  Trump is bearing down, digging his heels in on the globalists and they say, you know, if 40% of the public didn't vote, then only 36% actually voted.
[00:17:08.962 --> 00:17:10.363]  So how do you like that?
[00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.204]  You're a failure.
[00:17:11.204 --> 00:17:11.944]  You're a minority.
[00:17:13.487 --> 00:17:22.540]  In any broken coalition divided and conquered nation, it's going to end up being the biggest minority that ends up running things.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.787]  So see, in a broken coalition strategy, it's a two-way street if the public's awake.
[00:17:28.854 --> 00:17:34.475]  Now let's break down how they really did this and how I knew Trump was going to win from the science.
[00:17:34.475 --> 00:17:35.936]  If you're a TV viewer you can see this.
[00:17:35.936 --> 00:17:41.317]  If you're a radio listener, Infowars.com forward slash show to find the live free feeds.
[00:17:41.317 --> 00:17:42.997]  Please spread those feeds as well.
[00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:46.378]  You are the power and the resistance and the engine of this operation.
[00:17:46.378 --> 00:17:47.899]  Without you we're nothing.
[00:17:47.899 --> 00:17:50.119]  Newsweek special commemorative edition.
[00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:54.660]  Madam President Hillary Clinton's historic journey to the White House.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.521]  Printed the week before by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:17:58.939 --> 00:18:03.141]  Now here's CNN asking, how are the polls so wrong?
[00:18:03.141 --> 00:18:07.043]  Then they never give you a reason.
[00:18:07.043 --> 00:18:08.023]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[00:18:08.023 --> 00:18:08.704]  Here's another.
[00:18:08.704 --> 00:18:10.985]  The polls clearly got it wrong.
[00:18:10.985 --> 00:18:13.346]  The autopsy will take months.
[00:18:13.346 --> 00:18:14.326]  CNN.
[00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:17.828]  And they never gave us the autopsy, did they?
[00:18:17.828 --> 00:18:22.090]  MSNBC skews poll to put Clinton in the lead.
[00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.111]  Poll.
[00:18:23.111 --> 00:18:27.112]  Most see Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead.
[00:18:27.112 --> 00:18:27.172]  CNN.
[00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:35.000]  Now let's look at the real facts why they were panicking.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.501]  They have high-tech surveillance over Google, Apple,
[00:18:49.116 --> 00:18:53.202]  Facebook, Amazon, NSA, you name it.
[00:18:53.202 --> 00:18:57.948]  And they knew that the popular mention for Trump had him at 63 to 70 points at his high, 55 at his low.
[00:19:02.173 --> 00:19:16.001]  They knew with the different Bloomberg business terminals that are hooked in to every major corporate operation in the country of any large size and hooked into Thomson Reuters and hooked into all the other big databases.
[00:19:16.001 --> 00:19:17.021]  Let's skip this network break.
[00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:18.702]  This is too important.
[00:19:18.702 --> 00:19:19.843]  They knew.
[00:19:19.843 --> 00:19:20.743]  Thank you, sir.
[00:19:20.743 --> 00:19:26.526]  They're talking to me, folks.
[00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:27.467]  App maker.
[00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:29.328]  Trump will win election.
[00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:55.272]  Now see, that was August 13th, AppMaker, and then it goes into major apps that again are able to interface with samples of millions of users of the apps, and then they can go in and track what you're saying and doing on the app with AI computers, and the AI computers said Trump's gonna win Gigantor, and there are thousands of data points
[00:19:57.657 --> 00:20:00.819]  Per person, every week when you're using these apps.
[00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:04.422]  You add that together with millions of users, you have billions of data points.
[00:20:04.422 --> 00:20:10.227]  You add that into all the other algorithms, you get trillions of data points.
[00:20:10.227 --> 00:20:12.388]  Quadrillions of data points.
[00:20:12.388 --> 00:20:13.750]  It just compounds.
[00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:21.856]  So they knew good and well he was winning, and they tried to steal the election, but six states were waiting and blocked him.
[00:20:24.554 --> 00:20:32.458]  Trump would have won five other states and would have won the popular vote if they didn't have all this garbage going on.
[00:20:32.458 --> 00:20:41.762]  Despite a majority of opinion polls showing 2016 presidential election going to Democrat Hillary Clinton, a smartphone app developer says his data suggests challenger Trump will be the victor.
[00:20:41.762 --> 00:20:45.224]  Based on the stats we see, he looks strong, said Rick Malente.
[00:20:45.224 --> 00:20:46.225]  Let's get him on.
[00:20:46.225 --> 00:20:52.288]  Co-founder of San Diego-based Crazy Raccoons, maker of Zip, Questions, and Answer app.
[00:20:52.288 --> 00:20:52.688]  His app
[00:20:53.612 --> 00:20:58.314]  Poses questions and poll responses based on the average of 100,000 daily users.
[00:20:58.314 --> 00:21:00.656]  I go with Trump based on what I see.
[00:21:00.656 --> 00:21:01.856]  Absolutely.
[00:21:01.856 --> 00:21:04.758]  And he goes into, he was seeing Trump at 60, 65%.
[00:21:04.758 --> 00:21:09.220]  Let's continue.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.822]  Trump will win the election and it's more popular than Obama in 2008.
[00:21:13.822 --> 00:21:16.004]  AI system finds.
[00:21:16.004 --> 00:21:17.484]  CNBC.
[00:21:17.484 --> 00:21:20.426]  Business readers actually want to get the truth occasionally.
[00:21:22.588 --> 00:21:23.689]  I'm just going back, folks.
[00:21:23.689 --> 00:21:29.053]  You understand, they're doing the same thing now, when they tell you he's plunging in polls.
[00:21:29.053 --> 00:21:35.478]  But see, polls are finite, so they can't just keep dropping, dropping, dropping, dropping, because nobody's going to buy that, you know, 1% or 5% supporting.
[00:21:37.807 --> 00:21:55.352]  So they always want to show it at 50 and then drop it and say oh look he's in trouble and then raise it back up but not report on it and then drop it again to keep creating the illusion, the simulation in the minds of the sheeple and of weak-minded conservatives to start deserting Trump.
[00:21:57.523 --> 00:22:02.305]  Trump will win the election and is more popular than Obama in 2008, AI system finds.
[00:22:02.305 --> 00:22:05.606]  An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S.
[00:22:05.606 --> 00:22:12.209]  presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House.
[00:22:12.209 --> 00:22:16.371]  Mog AI was developed, founder of Indian Startup.
[00:22:16.371 --> 00:22:22.814]  It takes 20 million data points and forms public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in the U.S.
[00:22:22.814 --> 00:22:25.075]  and analyzes the information to create predictions.
[00:22:26.636 --> 00:22:36.819]  And it found a massive win for Obama and a massive win for Trump, and it found that October 28th, 10 days before the election.
[00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:38.140]  Want me to continue for a few hours here?
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.101]  Because I've got hundreds of these AI studies if you want them.
[00:22:42.101 --> 00:22:43.181]  Now what did the news say?
[00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:47.763]  This insane cuckoo head, Alex Jones, says Trump's 15 points ahead.
[00:22:49.266 --> 00:22:56.648]  Because if you average the AI stats out from hundreds of firms reporting it, Trump was 10 to 20 points ahead.
[00:22:56.648 --> 00:22:58.608]  What's the average of that?
[00:22:58.608 --> 00:22:59.068]  15!
[00:22:59.068 --> 00:23:01.229]  I don't need a supercomputer to know that.
[00:23:01.229 --> 00:23:04.630]  Hundreds of AIs saying 10 to 20 points ahead.
[00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:05.530]  Hundreds!
[00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.310]  None of them saying behind.
[00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.071]  None of them saying 5 points ahead.
[00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:11.351]  10 to 20 points.
[00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:12.872]  What's in the middle?
[00:23:12.872 --> 00:23:14.133]  15.
[00:23:14.133 --> 00:23:14.934]  15 points ahead.
[00:23:14.934 --> 00:23:16.555]  15 points ahead.
[00:23:16.555 --> 00:23:18.477]  15 points ahead.
[00:23:18.477 --> 00:23:20.358]  But again, they keep hammering you.
[00:23:20.358 --> 00:23:21.299]  He's unpopular.
[00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:22.219]  He's hated.
[00:23:22.219 --> 00:23:23.741]  Better not wear a shirt out in public.
[00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:29.105]  We'll knock you upside the head with a bottle.
[00:23:29.105 --> 00:23:30.066]  TechCrunch.
[00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:33.849]  Analysis of social media did a better job of predicting Trump win than the polls.
[00:23:35.202 --> 00:23:37.944]  Robot that keeps calling elections correctly has called the U.S.
[00:23:37.944 --> 00:23:43.888]  presidential race unindependent for Donald John Trump.
[00:23:43.888 --> 00:23:47.951]  So that's why I raise all of this at the start of the broadcast today.
[00:23:47.951 --> 00:23:58.037]  They're telling you everywhere that he's unpopular, that he is less popular than leprosy, than gonorrhea, than AIDS, than cancer.
[00:23:58.037 --> 00:23:58.738]  None of it's true.
[00:23:59.881 --> 00:24:12.174]  But super weak-minded losers that actually believe if they buy into trendiness and buy into mainstream media, that believe that they're going to end up being successful, that they're going to end up having a great future, they don't know what to do.
[00:24:12.174 --> 00:24:14.236]  So they get more hysterical.
[00:24:14.236 --> 00:24:16.538]  They get more worthless degrees.
[00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:19.021]  They go into more debt.
[00:24:19.021 --> 00:24:20.422]  They get more trendy.
[00:24:20.422 --> 00:24:22.024]  They fully commit to the cult.
[00:24:23.231 --> 00:24:29.694]  Believing that it's going to somehow deliver to them if they just go to the next level of commitment.
[00:24:29.694 --> 00:24:46.742]  And if they force us onto the globalist plantation and onto that program of total nihilistic idiocy and total anti-free speech, total societal collapse, that somehow then they'll be transported to Valhalla.
[00:24:46.742 --> 00:24:49.924]  What it is is a bunch of betas and cucks and weaklings.
[00:24:49.924 --> 00:24:52.265]  I don't mean physically beta, I mean mentally beta.
[00:24:53.649 --> 00:24:58.570]  Who are afraid of prosperity, afraid of prowess, afraid of competition.
[00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:09.673]  They're attempting in mass to bring that down, believing somehow in a collapse, they will end up being preeminent in a collapse.
[00:25:09.673 --> 00:25:19.375]  The real alpha males that have been trying to fix things and trying to create prosperity are going to absolutely turn into monsters and destroy you.
[00:25:20.575 --> 00:25:21.796]  History shows that.
[00:25:21.796 --> 00:25:25.459]  But again, this has happened before in decadent, tolerant societies.
[00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:29.922]  The strong become passive, the weak become aggressive.
[00:25:29.922 --> 00:25:35.907]  As the Bible says, children will rule over your parents, women will rule over the men.
[00:25:35.907 --> 00:25:37.969]  This happened in other cultures.
[00:25:37.969 --> 00:25:39.210]  And then it blooms
[00:25:40.782 --> 00:25:57.441]  Because of the massively spoiled rotten society and then it collapses and then super hyper road warrior lowest common denominator alpha male physical garbage takes over instead of super alpha that's, you know, spacesuits and jet packs and cancer cures.
[00:25:58.712 --> 00:26:07.239]  So what happens is, masses of people generally take the restraint of hyper-alpha males that actually want to build big, open, free societies.
[00:26:07.239 --> 00:26:13.183]  They see that as weakness, they pull it down, and then they open the gate for the monsters to come in.
[00:26:13.183 --> 00:26:13.824]  The marauders.
[00:26:15.748 --> 00:26:18.569]  And that leads me to the next big story I'm going to cover when we come back.
[00:26:18.569 --> 00:26:24.352]  Swedish Liberal Party, that's one of the big parties there, wants to legalize necrophilia and child porn.
[00:26:24.352 --> 00:26:26.513]  Infowars.com story.
[00:26:26.513 --> 00:26:29.714]  If you're against necrophilia, that's sex with dead people, you're not a liberal.
[00:26:29.714 --> 00:26:33.556]  Well, just ask Jimmy Savelle, Chris Charles' best friend, it's true.
[00:26:33.556 --> 00:26:43.260]  The Liberal Youth League says it wants to make Sweden a more tolerant society by endorsing, quote, ruthless mass immigration, necrophilia, and even child pornography.
[00:26:44.278 --> 00:26:45.298]  Yes, really.
[00:26:45.298 --> 00:26:58.885]  If you thought you heard it all in terms of Sweden and their Stockholm Syndrome, and the progressive basket case of Europe, the thing again, during a tweet storm, the youth group made plain its desire to see Sweden adopt the euro, single currency, and join NATO.
[00:26:59.525 --> 00:27:03.348]  But the organization's social policies were real eyebrow raisers.
[00:27:03.348 --> 00:27:05.069]  They want to submit to the establishment.
[00:27:05.069 --> 00:27:05.910]  That's part of it.
[00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.612]  If you are against necrophilia, you're not liberal, the group explained.
[00:27:08.612 --> 00:27:11.594]  For those who don't know, necrophilia is having sex with dead people.
[00:27:11.594 --> 00:27:12.595]  How progressive.
[00:27:12.595 --> 00:27:14.477]  The LUF also wants open borders.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:21.725]  Ruthless mass immigration, close quote, and it's calling for legalization of cartoon child pornography, polygamy and incest.
[00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:25.468]  The group has also previously called for the legalization of sex with animals.
[00:27:25.468 --> 00:27:29.111]  And again, this is what the intelligence agencies run by Globalist want.
[00:27:29.111 --> 00:27:37.657]  This is to make the mainline liberal parties that just want to have rape by Muslims of women legal, literally, they're now legalizing it, but only for Muslims.
[00:27:37.657 --> 00:27:38.218]  It's their culture.
[00:27:39.377 --> 00:27:42.378]  They're making cucking for Stockholm Syndrome the actual law.
[00:27:42.378 --> 00:27:44.039]  Hence, Stockholm, Sweden.
[00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:48.101]  I mean, that's why the term comes from there.
[00:27:48.101 --> 00:27:57.044]  And so this group's meant to move the Overton window and make the other groups not look extreme, that just want to be able to legalize having sex with your child down to age 10.
[00:27:57.044 --> 00:27:57.865]  When they come to your door...
[00:27:59.005 --> 00:28:01.286]  This is official UN policy under NAMBLA.
[00:28:01.286 --> 00:28:05.128]  You have to let your 10-year-old go with them if your 10-year-old wants to go.
[00:28:05.128 --> 00:28:13.813]  And they literally pull up with the ice cream trucks, with the puppies, and other kids and say, we're going to the mall, we're going to go have fun.
[00:28:13.813 --> 00:28:17.235]  And there's cartoons saying, go with the adults, it's fun, don't listen to your parents.
[00:28:17.235 --> 00:28:19.056]  This is now in Europe.
[00:28:19.056 --> 00:28:20.597]  Okay?
[00:28:20.597 --> 00:28:24.319]  And then your kid will just go with the pot-bellied pedophile, with the PBP.
[00:28:27.557 --> 00:28:28.657]  People don't want to believe this.
[00:28:28.657 --> 00:28:30.278]  This is the sexualization of children.
[00:28:30.278 --> 00:28:31.218]  They're teaching it in school.
[00:28:31.218 --> 00:28:34.120]  That's why Nickelodeon is teaching kids masturbation.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:39.642]  There's a YouTube video Paul reported on last week where they're on YouTube teaching, you know, six-year-olds how to masturbate.
[00:28:39.642 --> 00:28:40.902]  And you're like, what's the point of this?
[00:28:40.902 --> 00:28:44.264]  It's getting you used to seeing adults sexualizing children.
[00:28:45.185 --> 00:28:58.179]  Because that's their final sacrament as the society collapses, is aborting the kids, keeping them alive, selling their body organs until you finally exsanguinate them, and then have a big celebratory joke about it.
[00:28:58.179 --> 00:29:03.766]  And it's always taught by the most weak-looking, soul-sucked-looking adults.
[00:29:04.246 --> 00:29:06.447]  You watch all these sexualization videos.
[00:29:06.447 --> 00:29:08.268]  I mean, look at the woman teaching the kids.
[00:29:08.268 --> 00:29:10.569]  She looks like something out of a nightmare.
[00:29:10.569 --> 00:29:15.871]  Like you go into a subterranean cave where there's been a race of slaves for 5,000 years.
[00:29:15.871 --> 00:29:23.715]  And, you know, they're just like these pale, flat-faced, um, inbred features.
[00:29:23.715 --> 00:29:27.536]  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's literal hell gates being opened.
[00:29:27.536 --> 00:29:28.317]  Now, when we come back,
[00:29:29.295 --> 00:29:31.537]  We're going to play the number one video over the weekend.
[00:29:31.537 --> 00:29:34.499]  It's got more than 10 million views now.
[00:29:34.499 --> 00:29:39.443]  It's where they took my voice and put it to folk music.
[00:29:39.443 --> 00:29:40.564]  And they think this hurts us.
[00:29:40.564 --> 00:29:42.606]  This helps us.
[00:29:42.606 --> 00:29:44.988]  And our traffic is only exploding.
[00:29:44.988 --> 00:29:46.669]  So we're going to play this piece coming up.
[00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:51.733]  And then later in the week, I'm going to re-release it with all the documentation to what Time Warner
[00:29:52.955 --> 00:29:53.276]  Put out!
[00:30:04.642 --> 00:30:08.725]  We must keep the Internet free from communistic government restrictions and parameters.
[00:30:08.725 --> 00:30:09.346]  Why?
[00:30:09.346 --> 00:30:11.788]  Because it would stop memes and erase heroes.
[00:30:11.788 --> 00:30:12.668]  Don't believe me?
[00:30:12.668 --> 00:30:13.609]  Look at China.
[00:30:13.609 --> 00:30:21.455]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously memed with Barack Obama in 2013, when a picture of the two was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, too.
[00:30:21.455 --> 00:30:27.780]  This happened again after an awkward handshake with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Eeyore.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:32.123]  Other images, such as Winnie the Pooh in a car, have been memed alongside President Xi in his limo.
[00:30:32.443 --> 00:30:37.625]  But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular, China has now censored it from the Internet.
[00:30:37.625 --> 00:30:39.425]  This is commonplace in Communist China.
[00:30:39.425 --> 00:30:46.968]  As a recently deceased political dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo has had his name completely censored from the virtual world.
[00:30:46.968 --> 00:30:51.409]  Try sending his name in a message to a friend, and the message will disappear into cyberspace.
[00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:55.571]  Xiaobo died in Chinese custody, and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[00:30:55.571 --> 00:30:57.131]  Keep the Internet free in America.
[00:30:57.131 --> 00:30:58.352]  Stop net neutrality.
[00:30:58.352 --> 00:30:59.692]  Save meme magic.
[00:30:59.692 --> 00:31:01.833]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:31:04.284 --> 00:31:06.164]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:08.185]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:08.185 --> 00:31:11.086]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:11.086 --> 00:31:17.167]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:26.350]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:31.191]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:31:31.431 --> 00:31:33.873]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:33.873 --> 00:31:41.898]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:41.898 --> 00:31:42.999]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:44.094 --> 00:31:47.455]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:51.596]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:51.596 --> 00:31:58.298]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:58.298 --> 00:32:02.399]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4wrestore.com.
[00:32:04.332 --> 00:32:10.155]  Today I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[00:32:10.155 --> 00:32:19.061]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[00:32:19.061 --> 00:32:26.705]  When it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[00:32:26.705 --> 00:32:32.849]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[00:32:33.189 --> 00:32:36.251]  NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:40.954]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[00:32:40.954 --> 00:32:44.716]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[00:32:44.716 --> 00:32:47.438]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[00:32:47.438 --> 00:32:55.583]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party certified review agency, Power Review.
[00:32:55.583 --> 00:33:01.146]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com before it sells out again.
[00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:02.287]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:11.078 --> 00:33:28.331]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.331 --> 00:33:31.253]  It is an absolute fact that they're sexualizing our children.
[00:33:31.253 --> 00:33:35.616]  It is an absolute fact that the social engineers admit they're trying to break our will.
[00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:43.234]  And condition us to accept anything and everything, but then we can't say mother or father all over the U.S.
[00:33:43.234 --> 00:33:50.359]  or Europe on an entrance form for your elementary students because someone else might not have a mother or father.
[00:33:50.359 --> 00:33:52.921]  And they've got all these non-binary terms.
[00:33:52.921 --> 00:33:54.762]  They're using our open society.
[00:33:54.762 --> 00:33:56.764]  They're using our kindness.
[00:33:56.764 --> 00:34:02.248]  They're using our incredible Western hospitality, the globalist are.
[00:34:03.544 --> 00:34:08.927]  To turn us against ourselves and destroy every bedrock institution.
[00:34:08.927 --> 00:34:12.829]  That's all coming up and I'm going to get into the latest economic, military news.
[00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:15.510]  Kid Rock getting ready to run for the Senate.
[00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.051]  There's just so much to go over.
[00:34:17.051 --> 00:34:18.992]  Hillary caught red-handed.
[00:34:18.992 --> 00:34:26.476]  The big question is, why isn't she being indicted for money laundering and for violating campaign finance rules and espionage?
[00:34:26.476 --> 00:34:29.598]  Big story up on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:29.598 --> 00:34:31.779]  Incredible footage of Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:41.606]  Going in and attacking a Catholic Church, then I dovetail that with the Pope saying he doesn't want to hear about Christian roots.
[00:34:41.606 --> 00:34:48.072]  I've actually pulled up the London Guardian article where he actually is quoted as saying it.
[00:34:48.072 --> 00:34:50.934]  People don't believe this stuff when I say it because it sounds crazy.
[00:34:50.934 --> 00:34:52.695]  I know it does.
[00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:55.878]  But he's defending Islamic attacks.
[00:34:55.878 --> 00:34:59.401]  So that's all coming up.
[00:34:59.401 --> 00:35:00.462]  Before I go any further,
[00:35:01.914 --> 00:35:08.058]  I want to just remind listeners that we're running some of the biggest specials we've ever run for the entire month of July.
[00:35:08.058 --> 00:35:15.103]  But I told you, if some of the items started selling out, that we'd have to pull them from the specials.
[00:35:16.952 --> 00:35:40.304]  Obviously, if you sign up for AutoShip on any item, like the coffee, or the Secret 12, Vitamin B12, or the Knockout, or the BrainForce, or the SuperMill Vitality, or the X2 Survival Shield, we hold it back at whatever level you ordered it at, so that it can ship to you in 15 days, a month, 90 days, 6 months, you can cancel any time, an additional 10% off.
[00:35:42.443 --> 00:35:53.427]  Barring if you sign up for AutoShip, we are about to sell out of Super Mel Vitality, Survival Shield X2, the Gut Health Support Pack, because Biome Defense is getting low.
[00:35:53.427 --> 00:35:55.068]  We've got plenty of the MycoZX.
[00:35:55.068 --> 00:35:55.948]  That just came back in.
[00:35:57.349 --> 00:36:04.056]  We've got the DNA Force back in stock, but that's unbelievably starting to run low.
[00:36:04.056 --> 00:36:07.440]  We're going to have to pull by Wednesday.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.901]  It's going to be pulled.
[00:36:08.901 --> 00:36:10.883]  The DNA Force, 20% off.
[00:36:10.883 --> 00:36:14.767]  The Secret 12, I'm going to keep it 25% because it just came back in.
[00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:19.352]  The Gut Health Support Pack, we'll still have the MycoZX, but we're not going to have the Biome Defense, 30% off with it.
[00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:22.570]  The X2 won't be 30% off.
[00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.210]  The Supermel won't be 30% off.
[00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.251]  The BrainForce Plus, now at 20% more in each bottle.
[00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:28.792]  People love this product.
[00:36:28.792 --> 00:36:30.373]  It is our number one best seller.
[00:36:30.373 --> 00:36:34.454]  It's not our most profitable because the price is so low.
[00:36:34.454 --> 00:36:36.855]  Similar brands that have similar ingredients are $50 to $60.
[00:36:36.855 --> 00:36:40.957]  It is $20 discounted right now.
[00:36:40.957 --> 00:36:42.317]  You cannot beat BrainForce.
[00:36:42.317 --> 00:36:43.938]  Try that today.
[00:36:43.938 --> 00:36:48.400]  So all of those will end Wednesday, by the end of the show.
[00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:54.994]  I'm going to add a few other things back onto the sale that we are just now getting back in.
[00:36:54.994 --> 00:37:01.580]  But those items have to, because Tim just came to me and said we're running low on all four of those items.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.942]  And quite frankly, I don't like selling out.
[00:37:03.942 --> 00:37:08.646]  So now when we get down to like 5% of inventory, I just go back to regular price until more comes in.
[00:37:08.646 --> 00:37:11.488]  Again, again, if you sign up for auto ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:37:11.488 --> 00:37:12.049]  But these are
[00:37:13.266 --> 00:37:20.749]  Amazing supplements and you know it's going to fund an organization that is committed to fighting the globalists and that is getting big results.
[00:37:20.749 --> 00:37:22.210]  High quality products.
[00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.071]  Very affordable prices.
[00:37:24.071 --> 00:37:26.072]  Funding the tip of the spear for human liberty.
[00:37:26.072 --> 00:37:27.352]  Getting results.
[00:37:27.352 --> 00:37:28.813]  Changing history together.
[00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:29.913]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[00:37:31.514 --> 00:37:33.355]  Total 360 win.
[00:37:33.355 --> 00:37:44.201]  Not some delusional, fancy guru positivity, but real action, real force of nature, real strength.
[00:37:44.201 --> 00:37:54.406]  With all of us together, working together, focused together, spreading the word together, getting intel together, and supporting each other, we're unstoppable with God's grace.
[00:37:55.518 --> 00:38:00.002]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:38:00.002 --> 00:38:10.833]  I just cut liners for five new stations this morning that have picked us up, and I want to tell our stations, I know over the years I have not serviced you properly.
[00:38:10.833 --> 00:38:17.640]  I've been so busy and so focused, and working with GCN, nothing against them, I just, they get busy, I get busy, they're in Minnesota, I'm in Texas.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:28.922]  And sometimes I haven't cut liners, I haven't been on your stations as a guest, I haven't done the things I should do, the other talk show hosts do, because I've been in the trenches.
[00:38:28.922 --> 00:38:30.423]  I apologize for that.
[00:38:30.423 --> 00:38:44.446]  I've hired two people to do affiliate relations, and I've hired two people to help me service the stations, and so now, in fact I didn't mean to do this, I just thought of this, will you go ask David for his email?
[00:38:45.683 --> 00:38:48.084]  I know what it is, but I want to double check I'm giving the right one out.
[00:38:48.084 --> 00:39:01.708]  I want to give out to our affiliates these emails where you can send your liners, send your interview requests, I'll give it at the start of the next segment, so that we can service you properly.
[00:39:01.708 --> 00:39:05.090]  Sure, the general email is affiliates at InfoWars.
[00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:11.712]  I was going to give you some of these new guys who are great guys, work at some of the biggest networks in the country, their info.
[00:39:11.712 --> 00:39:14.533]  We got two people now working full time to make sure I do the liners.
[00:39:15.546 --> 00:39:19.888]  If you've got local sponsors that I agree with the product on, I'll voice it for you.
[00:39:19.888 --> 00:39:28.072]  I will come to local affiliates that have been carrying us for at least a year and that have done good in the ratings, which all of them do.
[00:39:28.072 --> 00:39:31.214]  I will come on your local station and do interviews.
[00:39:31.214 --> 00:39:37.877]  I am going to make up for 20 plus years of being so grassroots that I couldn't service our affiliates properly.
[00:39:37.877 --> 00:39:38.798]  I appreciate you.
[00:39:38.798 --> 00:39:40.659]  I apologize for not doing it.
[00:39:40.659 --> 00:39:44.361]  We've gone over 200 affiliates and now that's the missing link.
[00:39:45.001 --> 00:39:45.341]  I don't know.
[00:39:59.215 --> 00:40:01.017]  Basically the entire production over.
[00:40:01.017 --> 00:40:07.081]  Myself, because outside of GCN, I'm going to be launching some new radio and TV shows.
[00:40:07.081 --> 00:40:07.842]  I'm going to work with them.
[00:40:07.842 --> 00:40:09.083]  If they want to carry them, that's fine.
[00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:10.604]  I still like GCN.
[00:40:10.604 --> 00:40:11.305]  They're great.
[00:40:11.305 --> 00:40:12.646]  They're in Minnesota.
[00:40:12.646 --> 00:40:14.768]  I need to be able to run things myself here.
[00:40:14.768 --> 00:40:16.149]  I told Ted this about a year ago.
[00:40:16.149 --> 00:40:21.233]  I officially let him know about six months ago that I'm going to be launching my own network, my own shows.
[00:40:22.654 --> 00:40:24.175]  It's so we can be in full control of it.
[00:40:24.175 --> 00:40:25.556]  I'm still partnered with GCN.
[00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:26.596]  They're great guys.
[00:40:26.596 --> 00:40:29.038]  It's just there's no middleman here now.
[00:40:29.038 --> 00:40:33.160]  Affiliates at InfoWars.com.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:40.285]  I want to send out to all the stations care packages of videos, books, water filtration systems.
[00:40:40.285 --> 00:40:42.886]  I just ran into the manager of Barton Springs Saturday.
[00:40:42.886 --> 00:40:49.670]  I was there with my children and the manager came over and said he ordered a ProPure about four years ago and they loved it.
[00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.972]  They would take the spring water out and drink it and how great it was.
[00:40:53.206 --> 00:40:56.509]  Then he said that somebody dropped it and broke the filters.
[00:40:56.509 --> 00:41:02.614]  I'm gonna deliver today to Martin Springs a free ProPure because that's what it's all about.
[00:41:02.614 --> 00:41:10.840]  So if you want a fun package of t-shirts and books and videos, DVDs, we will send it out to every station out there.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.784]  Just tell us what you want, station managers, station owners, and you're going to get it.
[00:41:15.784 --> 00:41:19.807]  I got two people, full-time, ready to take care of you.
[00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:23.102]  The stations are really, really responding.
[00:41:23.102 --> 00:41:25.264]  I'm going to change the clock soon, too.
[00:41:25.264 --> 00:41:25.964]  I was pig-headed.
[00:41:25.964 --> 00:41:27.785]  I was very pig-headed.
[00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:31.588]  20 years ago, Ted Anderson said, this is the clock you need.
[00:41:31.588 --> 00:41:32.748]  All the stations carry news.
[00:41:32.748 --> 00:41:33.889]  They come in at 6 after.
[00:41:33.889 --> 00:41:39.433]  And I said, I don't want to carry government propaganda, because all there was was Fox and CBS.
[00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:40.373]  I said, I don't want to carry that.
[00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:41.974]  And he said, OK.
[00:41:41.974 --> 00:41:43.455]  Later, they got USA Radio Network.
[00:41:43.455 --> 00:41:44.716]  That's better.
[00:41:44.716 --> 00:41:49.379]  So we always have that weird clock where I have a five-minute segment, and then three minutes of ads, and I come in at 8 after.
[00:41:50.691 --> 00:41:53.975]  And then we're going to send out to the affiliates in the next few days, new clock.
[00:41:53.975 --> 00:41:56.537]  It's the standard radio clock to make sure you like it.
[00:41:56.537 --> 00:41:58.940]  We're going to be going to the standard radio clock for everybody.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.942]  We're going to do all that stuff.
[00:42:00.942 --> 00:42:02.323]  So very, very exciting.
[00:42:02.323 --> 00:42:05.267]  Very, very pleased to be doing that.
[00:42:05.267 --> 00:42:07.149]  And the stations are ecstatic because
[00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:13.571]  We have at least 50 emails the last year from stations saying, we will carry your show.
[00:42:13.571 --> 00:42:15.572]  You must go to the regular clock.
[00:42:15.572 --> 00:42:17.232]  You must go to the regular clock.
[00:42:17.232 --> 00:42:18.833]  You must go to the regular clock.
[00:42:18.833 --> 00:42:20.013]  You must go to the regular clock.
[00:42:20.013 --> 00:42:22.594]  And I don't know why I never did it.
[00:42:22.594 --> 00:42:24.454]  Wow, I want all those stations.
[00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:26.195]  I'm going to do that.
[00:42:26.195 --> 00:42:29.896]  And now we can produce every day, twice a day,
[00:42:31.383 --> 00:42:35.207]  Three minutes of InfoWars news with the Radio Minutes you hear.
[00:42:35.207 --> 00:42:43.054]  Together, those vignettes, they have original news if the stations choose to carry it or they can carry whatever other news they want.
[00:42:43.054 --> 00:42:45.557]  So, very, very exciting.
[00:42:45.557 --> 00:42:49.421]  We're going to watch David Knight's show on the new clock coming up on
[00:42:50.866 --> 00:42:52.487]  September 20th, I think's the date.
[00:42:52.487 --> 00:42:53.447]  No, no, no.
[00:42:53.447 --> 00:42:54.548]  August 20th.
[00:42:54.548 --> 00:42:56.488]  I'm going from memory here, teleprompter free.
[00:42:56.488 --> 00:42:59.670]  And then we're going to launch new shows in September as well.
[00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.211]  So a lot of exciting things coming up.
[00:43:02.211 --> 00:43:03.891]  I'm done basically ranting about that.
[00:43:03.891 --> 00:43:07.673]  It's just that it's not just about taking care of InfoWars and our operations.
[00:43:07.673 --> 00:43:11.174]  It's about also helping our local stations and local affiliates.
[00:43:11.174 --> 00:43:13.475]  So please make donations to local stations.
[00:43:13.475 --> 00:43:18.337]  Please thank them, become a sponsor, support their sponsors and let them know why you're supporting them.
[00:43:18.337 --> 00:43:19.498]  And more importantly,
[00:43:20.828 --> 00:43:27.410]  Spread the word about those local AM and FM stations, because that's where we're reaching the big, giant audiences.
[00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.871]  Oh, more good news!
[00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:37.853]  The Federal Election Commission, the Democrats, have called for me to be criminally investigated last week.
[00:43:37.853 --> 00:43:44.415]  Now, the FBI announced that under orders from Obama, they had opened an investigation of Breitbart, Grudge Report, InfoWars.
[00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:48.108]  For being influenced by the Russians.
[00:43:48.108 --> 00:43:49.788]  That is a criminal investigation.
[00:43:49.788 --> 00:43:50.709]  Doesn't mean we're criminals.
[00:43:50.709 --> 00:43:52.209]  It is a criminal investigation.
[00:43:52.209 --> 00:43:53.370]  It's totally made up.
[00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:56.131]  It's like investigating me for being a Martian spy.
[00:43:56.131 --> 00:44:00.473]  Or a spy from, you know, Obama's Uranus.
[00:44:00.473 --> 00:44:05.055]  That said, the Republican-controlled group came out and said this is a witch hunt.
[00:44:05.055 --> 00:44:06.176]  Americans have free speech.
[00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.956]  This is asinine.
[00:44:07.956 --> 00:44:10.097]  These websites have been around for decades.
[00:44:10.097 --> 00:44:11.018]  The American people
[00:44:12.031 --> 00:44:15.953]  Elected Trump, not Russia, and basically stop your fear-mongering.
[00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:18.874]  The proper slapdown.
[00:44:18.874 --> 00:44:20.255]  So, that is very exciting.
[00:44:20.255 --> 00:44:22.556]  But know this, there are dirty tricks.
[00:44:22.556 --> 00:44:23.856]  There is harassment.
[00:44:23.856 --> 00:44:28.938]  There is garbage that goes on behind the scenes to try to shut down our affiliates, to try to get them to not carry us.
[00:44:28.938 --> 00:44:37.062]  That's why it's important to pray for those stations, appreciate them, and know that they're standing up for this country, and that we should stand up with them.
[00:44:37.062 --> 00:44:41.204]  So make that commitment to support our affiliates today, now more than ever.
[00:44:42.278 --> 00:44:48.960]  Because the broadcast is growing, but we need to cover our flanks, not just our main attack force.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:54.382]  Okay.
[00:44:54.382 --> 00:44:58.404]  I want to get back into the decadence.
[00:44:58.404 --> 00:45:08.227]  I want to get back into how they're trying to brainwash the public, how they're trying to make us hopeless, how they're trying to collapse society, to then bring in total tyranny after the break.
[00:45:08.227 --> 00:45:09.768]  But before I go any further,
[00:45:11.058 --> 00:45:24.606]  I'm gonna put on screen a screenshot from this morning from Super Deluxe that's owned by Time Warner that puts out some comical videos where there's four, no, no, excuse me, five plus million views of this video.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.461]  5.5 million views.
[00:45:28.461 --> 00:45:32.403]  Now, if you go to their other site, there's 3 million downloads.
[00:45:32.403 --> 00:45:36.066]  And if you go to their YouTube, there's another half million views.
[00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:43.311]  So you add that together, that's over 8 million views, and the view counts are usually a day or two behind.
[00:45:43.311 --> 00:45:46.453]  I said Saturday that it had 7 million views, because it did.
[00:45:46.453 --> 00:45:50.175]  A whole new story began that I was lying about that.
[00:45:50.175 --> 00:45:53.598]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've produced films that have been viewed over 100 million times.
[00:45:54.378 --> 00:45:57.579]  Paul Watson has created videos that get seen 35 million times.
[00:45:57.579 --> 00:46:00.799]  They can't stand the fact that our content is number one.
[00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:03.860]  I just showed you one platform, 5.5.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.120]  That went up Saturday morning.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.621]  It'll have 20 million views in a week.
[00:46:08.621 --> 00:46:09.701]  People say it's a hit piece.
[00:46:09.701 --> 00:46:10.601]  No, it's not.
[00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.462]  The corporate guys are old and dumb.
[00:46:12.462 --> 00:46:14.102]  And by old, I mean old thinking.
[00:46:14.102 --> 00:46:16.502]  They think this stuff hurts me.
[00:46:16.502 --> 00:46:19.483]  This stuff only helps me.
[00:46:19.483 --> 00:46:19.743]  Okay?
[00:46:21.098 --> 00:46:25.561]  And so, I know it sends people to hear what I've actually said, what I'm actually doing.
[00:46:25.561 --> 00:46:27.923]  I've been through this so long, I know.
[00:46:27.923 --> 00:46:30.825]  And the people making it, by the way, they know it's helping us.
[00:46:30.825 --> 00:46:32.066]  They're huge fans.
[00:46:32.066 --> 00:46:34.969]  You go to Super Deluxe, it's super liberal and super trendy.
[00:46:34.969 --> 00:46:36.870]  They now have totally woken up.
[00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:38.691]  We can see them coming in.
[00:46:38.691 --> 00:46:46.978]  We can see the demographics off our Google systems that the liberals are now listening and they love it and we're actually waking them up through the celebration of making fun of each other.
[00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:52.730]  CNN could have responded to being attacked by Trump like this, and it would have made them super popular.
[00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:53.450]  I love it.
[00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:54.792]  I've always loved it.
[00:46:54.792 --> 00:46:57.274]  I love being made fun of by my children.
[00:46:57.274 --> 00:46:58.835]  I love being made fun of by my wife.
[00:46:58.835 --> 00:47:00.357]  I love making fun of my friends.
[00:47:00.357 --> 00:47:01.698]  It's good nature.
[00:47:01.698 --> 00:47:11.607]  Now, this is some nasty topics they put in there, and I'm going to take it this week, Rob Dewey is, with McBrain, and we're going to add documents and video clips to everything I say.
[00:47:11.607 --> 00:47:12.268]  Everything I say.
[00:47:13.584 --> 00:47:21.026]  I'm going to show you pot-bellied people with green-colored skin screaming, I love Satan, I kill my children, and then howling.
[00:47:21.026 --> 00:47:24.327]  I'm going to show you them keeping babies alive and harvesting their organs.
[00:47:24.327 --> 00:47:27.248]  I'm going to show you everything I say in this video.
[00:47:27.248 --> 00:47:30.729]  But no, this was the number one video this weekend.
[00:47:32.867 --> 00:47:37.210]  With eight plus, probably nine million if you add it all together, and they're a few days behind.
[00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:46.715]  When the counters update, you watch in a few days, it'll be 50 million views total, 20 million on one platform, 15 on another, 10 on another.
[00:47:46.715 --> 00:47:48.436]  I know how these algorithms work.
[00:47:48.436 --> 00:47:58.302]  So imagine, imagine this is bigger than any movie that's out right now, and it's meant to be an attack by the corporates, but only makes us greater.
[00:47:58.302 --> 00:48:00.303]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[00:48:00.303 --> 00:48:01.364]  Here it is, Super Deluxe.
[00:48:05.009 --> 00:48:06.510]  The paradigm of absolute control.
[00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:11.694]  And that's why we're just out here doing simple things, pointing out that we're meant to be in nature and be natural.
[00:48:11.694 --> 00:48:15.817]  And this is where we find the source that God made to transcend the new world order.
[00:48:15.817 --> 00:48:17.178]  And that's why they want to try to keep us out of it.
[00:48:21.591 --> 00:48:24.614]  I've had enough of these people.
[00:48:24.614 --> 00:48:27.176]  They're a bunch of Christian murderous scum.
[00:48:27.176 --> 00:48:30.238]  They're on giant death factories keeping babies alive.
[00:48:30.238 --> 00:48:33.041]  They're selling their body parts.
[00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:35.723]  What more do you need to know about these people?
[00:48:35.723 --> 00:48:38.785]  I go out and face these scum.
[00:48:38.785 --> 00:48:42.368]  They literally crawl out from under rocks.
[00:48:42.368 --> 00:48:44.210]  They have green looking skin.
[00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:47.232]  And they run around screaming we love Satan.
[00:48:47.232 --> 00:48:49.054]  We wanna eat babies.
[00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:52.111]  We good?
[00:49:03.344 --> 00:49:05.864]  That's me walking on river rocks.
[00:49:33.985 --> 00:49:50.696]  We'll suck self-centered crap We don't even know what's ahead of us Rising up against us Millions of pointed people Of the very worst type And I'm so pissed
[00:50:04.858 --> 00:50:34.085]  We're gonna stab your daughter at the mall We're gonna stab your wife, your son We're gonna stab you with a butcher knife And then the police chief is gonna say We love our Somalis We love our Muslims Oh, they're so good Oh, they're so sweet
[00:50:37.921 --> 00:50:40.263]  I was watching Fox News as I worked out this morning.
[00:50:40.263 --> 00:50:41.944]  Wasn't that nice?

[00:53:35.708 --> 00:53:38.810]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:39.370]  At home.
[00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:40.031]  At work.
[00:53:40.031 --> 00:53:40.831]  In the car.

[00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:02.342]  Effective.
[00:54:04.895 --> 00:54:07.137]  We're good to go.
[00:54:19.953 --> 00:54:26.097]  She sleeps in the same room with that creepy weirdo woman whose mother wears a full overhead.
[00:54:26.097 --> 00:54:27.478]  What the hell?
[00:54:27.478 --> 00:54:31.300]  That woman number one is ugly.
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:35.103]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[00:54:35.103 --> 00:54:38.865]  I'm told her and Obama just stink.
[00:54:38.865 --> 00:54:42.628]  Obama and Hillary both smell like chiseled fur.
[00:54:50.407 --> 00:54:52.768]  Man, I can't wait for the full album.
[00:54:52.768 --> 00:54:55.669]  And the word is, the album's being produced.
[00:54:55.669 --> 00:54:56.689]  This is the 21st century.
[00:54:56.689 --> 00:54:57.190]  This is 2017.
[00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:58.990]  This is how the globalists fall.
[00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.851]  This is how they go down.
[00:55:19.258 --> 00:55:21.139]  Because they all are such narcissists.
[00:55:21.139 --> 00:55:27.524]  They take themselves so seriously and they're all trying to project this image of power and invincibility.
[00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:29.786]  They can't stand it when they get made fun of.
[00:55:29.786 --> 00:55:33.529]  I get all these calls going, how are you taking this?
[00:55:33.529 --> 00:55:36.852]  I am loving it!
[00:55:36.852 --> 00:55:38.453]  You go look at the comments.
[00:55:38.453 --> 00:55:43.237]  I read hundreds of them on Facebook and on YouTube of the, you know, eight, nine million views.
[00:55:44.716 --> 00:55:47.278]  And it's, I used to hate Alex, I love him now.
[00:55:47.278 --> 00:55:50.100]  And I went and listened to his show, and it actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:51.581]  Why, why didn't I see this?
[00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:53.943]  And they're putting it out to hurt me!
[00:55:53.943 --> 00:55:59.287]  But I've talked to people at these companies, not at Super Deluxe, but a bunch of them, they're like, oh, we totally know you're on target.
[00:55:59.287 --> 00:56:01.108]  We know you're not some, you know, crazy right-winger.
[00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:02.169]  We know you're a libertarian.
[00:56:02.169 --> 00:56:02.990]  We're all controlled.
[00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.750]  We hate it.
[00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:09.334]  Our bosses are so dumb, though, they think stuff like this hurts you, and they let us put it out.
[00:56:09.334 --> 00:56:11.316]  I almost don't want to let folks know the secrets.
[00:56:14.226 --> 00:56:17.676]  But it's just absolutely amazing.
[00:56:19.787 --> 00:56:24.768]  And I can't even keep track of Colbert and The Daily Show.
[00:56:24.768 --> 00:56:36.671]  I mean, I saw last week three or four clips that I didn't even have time to watch all of them where they're attacking me and making fun of me all over entertainment television and misrepresenting what I stand for.
[00:56:36.671 --> 00:56:39.831]  Everybody knows they're liars and they're just coming and finding the truth.
[00:56:39.831 --> 00:56:42.352]  There's very small groups of minority people.
[00:56:42.352 --> 00:56:48.153]  I don't mean minority racially, but you know, small minorities of liberals that
[00:56:49.628 --> 00:56:53.570]  Really believe that if you're being made fun of, you're not in the cool kid class.
[00:56:53.570 --> 00:57:07.037]  No, when everyone's talking about you, and you're changing the world, and your listeners just got a rebel president elected, and the economy's coming back, that's called really winning.
[00:57:07.037 --> 00:57:11.459]  And I don't get up here and talk about myself winning to be on a power trip.
[00:57:11.459 --> 00:57:13.100]  I want you to know you're winning.
[00:57:13.976 --> 00:57:15.677]  You've broken with the globalists.
[00:57:15.677 --> 00:57:16.597]  You're not a conservative.
[00:57:16.597 --> 00:57:18.017]  You're not a liberal.
[00:57:18.017 --> 00:57:23.219]  You're a person that just wants common sense and prosperity.
[00:57:23.219 --> 00:57:30.602]  The problem is they've gotten a lot of the so-called lefts hyped up into a position where they think being nasty, being mean, being hateful.
[00:57:30.602 --> 00:57:36.984]  John Bound did a report, we're going to play in the first five minutes of the next hour, about proofs that liberals commit more crimes than any other group.
[00:57:36.984 --> 00:57:39.445]  This is in major studies.
[00:57:39.445 --> 00:57:42.026]  You can just search engine liberals six times more likely
[00:57:43.407 --> 00:57:47.371]  To not give to charity, nine times more likely to steal.
[00:57:47.371 --> 00:57:49.272]  I tend to always flip that statistic in my head.
[00:57:49.272 --> 00:57:50.453]  You guys search into that for me.
[00:57:50.453 --> 00:57:53.796]  It's like BBC, Toronto, Star.
[00:57:53.796 --> 00:58:00.763]  I mean, they've done Canadian, US, British, German, Australian, Chinese, Russian studies.
[00:58:00.763 --> 00:58:08.830]  And they always find between six, nine, ten times more likely for liberals to say they're giving to charity, but they don't.
[00:58:10.336 --> 00:58:12.438]  Say they're against stealing, but they steal.
[00:58:12.438 --> 00:58:16.762]  Just search engine, conservatives give the biggest tips.
[00:58:16.762 --> 00:58:18.444]  It's a fact.
[00:58:18.444 --> 00:58:24.189]  I've had waiters come over and go, you know, I used to be kind of a big liberal, until I learned liberals don't tip.
[00:58:24.189 --> 00:58:27.031]  They're really stingy people.
[00:58:27.031 --> 00:58:29.574]  Liberals are meaner, cheaper, more willing to steal than conservatives.
[00:58:30.247 --> 00:58:32.768]  And then it links to some of the studies, yeah.
[00:58:32.768 --> 00:58:35.548]  Alright, and again, that's modern terms.
[00:58:35.548 --> 00:58:36.709]  Those aren't liberals.
[00:58:36.709 --> 00:58:42.790]  Those are follower-trendies that don't know why they're not successful because they're not trailblazers.
[00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:44.071]  They're not innovators.
[00:58:44.071 --> 00:58:45.491]  That's what we are!
[00:58:45.491 --> 00:58:46.711]  We're not conservative.
[00:58:46.711 --> 00:58:47.552]  We're not liberal.
[00:58:47.552 --> 00:58:49.152]  We're innovators!
[00:58:49.152 --> 00:58:50.652]  We're rugged individuals!
[00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:52.393]  We're fire-breathing!
[00:58:54.244 --> 00:59:04.832]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:59:04.832 --> 00:59:06.894]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:59:06.894 --> 00:59:09.756]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:59:09.756 --> 00:59:11.257]  It's made in the USA.
[00:59:11.257 --> 00:59:14.380]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:18.063]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:59:18.063 --> 00:59:20.144]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:59:20.144 --> 00:59:29.872]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:59:29.872 --> 00:59:42.381]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[00:59:42.401 --> 00:59:43.981]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:16.838 --> 01:00:31.985]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.985 --> 01:00:33.606]  Here's John Bowne's powerful report.
[01:00:35.472 --> 01:00:44.359]  Clinton is to lead the Democratic Party in 2018 midterm elections, which pretty much the campaigning force started in the last few weeks.
[01:00:44.359 --> 01:00:46.520]  She has incredible negative numbers.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.621]  Her own party hates her.
[01:00:47.621 --> 01:00:51.244]  The Sanders supporters hate her because she stole the nomination from him.
[01:00:51.244 --> 01:00:51.944]  But it gets better.
[01:00:51.944 --> 01:00:55.507]  Nancy Pelosi is to be the co-head.
[01:00:55.507 --> 01:00:59.290]  Affecting California very directly is the Affordable Care Act.
[01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:06.912]  President Bush has come out against that as you know and he has and it is not even a health care bill.
[01:01:06.912 --> 01:01:14.534]  With her along with you can't make this up Elizabeth Warren aka Pocahontas.
[01:01:14.534 --> 01:01:27.297]  46% of Democrats have said that Elizabeth Warren should not run so there's a significant opportunity or so for me defeating Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts is driving a bigger blow at these institutions of power right at the belly of the beast.
[01:01:27.297 --> 01:01:27.637]  I think only
[01:01:32.788 --> 01:01:35.990]  All incredibly unpopular, even in their own party.
[01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:39.954]  And they've tried to unseat, obviously, Nancy Pelosi.
[01:01:39.954 --> 01:01:43.176]  They've tried to have Hillary put out the pasture, but it doesn't happen.
[01:01:44.093 --> 01:01:45.094]  You know what?
[01:01:45.094 --> 01:01:52.399]  Maybe it's good to keep the old guard in because even though they're super unpopular, if you look at who's coming up next, it's even more frightening.
[01:01:52.399 --> 01:01:59.063]  Linda Sarsour, who has at least three close family members in Israeli prisons for terrorism.
[01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:04.687]  Because this, ladies and gentlemen, is a Palestinian, which means basically a vagabond in the Middle East.
[01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:07.089]  Saudi Arabia won't take him.
[01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:08.750]  Jordan won't take him.
[01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.171]  Egypt won't take him.
[01:02:10.171 --> 01:02:11.732]  Syria won't take him.
[01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:12.993]  Sudan won't take him.
[01:02:15.248 --> 01:02:17.431]  Somalia won't take them.
[01:02:17.431 --> 01:02:19.073]  Iran won't take them.
[01:02:19.073 --> 01:02:21.697]  No one will take a Palestinian.
[01:02:21.697 --> 01:02:33.011]  Because any Arab will tell you, or any Muslim will tell you, that Palestinians 24-7 are trying to take over your political process.
[01:02:34.031 --> 01:02:37.312]  And wherever they go, discord terrorism starts.
[01:02:37.312 --> 01:02:56.401]  When we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad, that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers, not only abroad in the Middle East or in the other side of the world, but here in these United States of America where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House.
[01:02:56.781 --> 01:02:58.843]  We're winning the info war.
[01:02:58.843 --> 01:03:05.510]  And imagine if you start a fight with the libertarians, the conservatives, the veterans, 90% of the veterans being patriots.
[01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:12.217]  The police, the military, the patriots, the people with the resources, the middle class, multicultural groups that want freedom.
[01:03:12.217 --> 01:03:13.298]  You're fools.
[01:03:13.298 --> 01:03:14.659]  I've been to your communist rallies.
[01:03:14.659 --> 01:03:16.301]  I've been to your anti-fa rallies.
[01:03:16.301 --> 01:03:18.784]  You guys look like you don't even know how to wipe your butts.
[01:03:19.284 --> 01:03:20.525]  I don't say that meanly.
[01:03:20.525 --> 01:03:21.986]  You look uncared for.
[01:03:21.986 --> 01:03:23.807]  You can tell you were put in a crib.
[01:03:23.807 --> 01:03:25.228]  You were never taken care of.
[01:03:25.228 --> 01:03:28.490]  Most of you were foster children who weren't even given enough milk.
[01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:30.291]  You've got shriveled brains.
[01:03:30.291 --> 01:03:32.572]  You're six times more likely not to give to charity.
[01:03:32.572 --> 01:03:36.114]  Nine times more likely to steal in major surveys.
[01:03:36.114 --> 01:03:37.315]  Hundreds of studies.
[01:03:37.315 --> 01:03:40.897]  I understand you've been told by the corporate media you're going to get ahead.
[01:03:40.897 --> 01:03:43.639]  If you can pull down the middle class, you'll get some booty.
[01:03:43.639 --> 01:03:44.460]  You'll get some goodies.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.580]  You'll get some spoils.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.301]  You'll get some loot.
[01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:48.042]  You're not going to get it.
[01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:50.192]  They didn't get it in Venezuela.
[01:03:50.192 --> 01:03:51.272]  They didn't get it in Russia.
[01:03:51.272 --> 01:03:52.492]  They didn't get it in North Korea.
[01:03:52.492 --> 01:03:53.413]  They didn't get it in China.
[01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:55.334]  You don't get it.
[01:03:55.334 --> 01:03:58.835]  Limited free market is what has developed untold wealth.
[01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:02.076]  True free market will take us to the stars and beyond.
[01:04:02.076 --> 01:04:06.658]  They don't want you to know there's unlimited resources in the human mind.
[01:04:06.658 --> 01:04:14.822]  We've already come 95% of the way we need to go to life extension out to a point where we're technically immortal.
[01:04:14.822 --> 01:04:16.062]  We are already there.
[01:04:16.062 --> 01:04:17.623]  We're at the threshold
[01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:19.816]  And are facing the globalists.
[01:04:19.816 --> 01:04:26.900]  And once they're out of the way, ladies and gentlemen, it's unlimited what we're about to have.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.503]  But of course they're teaching us all to hate each other and kill each other and act like fools.
[01:04:31.503 --> 01:04:38.968]  And a lot of you aren't gonna win and you're not gonna transcend because you have bought into this either as a globalist or as a minion.
[01:04:38.968 --> 01:04:42.651]  Either selfishly as a globalist or selfishly as a minion.
[01:04:42.651 --> 01:04:46.033]  You're profane and you're not meant to pass the gate.
[01:04:46.033 --> 01:04:47.394]  And it's very sad.
[01:04:50.194 --> 01:04:51.395]  Alright, start your engines.
[01:04:51.395 --> 01:04:55.036]  We have got masses of key news and intel straight ahead.
[01:04:55.036 --> 01:05:00.419]  We're going to break down what is going to look like in a post-Nihilist society.
[01:05:00.419 --> 01:05:02.520]  Straight ahead on AlexJonesInfoWars.com
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:10.626]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[01:05:10.626 --> 01:05:12.127]  The contest is simple.

[01:05:17.593 --> 01:05:24.780]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:31.585]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:31.585 --> 01:05:41.654]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[01:05:41.654 --> 01:05:49.220]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:59.486]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[01:05:59.486 --> 01:06:02.947]  For more contest rules, visit Infowars.com forward slash contest.
[01:06:02.947 --> 01:06:03.788]  This is Kit Daniels.

[01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.468]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.

[01:06:14.909 --> 01:06:16.110]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:16.990]  Big waiting list.
[01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:20.832]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[01:06:20.832 --> 01:06:22.473]  Nobody's got something as good.
[01:06:22.473 --> 01:06:29.057]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion live in each pill.

[01:06:45.288 --> 01:06:51.172]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:51.752]  Now it's epidemic.
[01:06:51.752 --> 01:06:54.715]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them.
[01:06:54.715 --> 01:06:57.116]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.

[01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:12.914]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:12.914 --> 01:07:21.018]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:21.298 --> 01:07:26.180]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:32.963]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:32.963 --> 01:07:40.145]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:40.145 --> 01:07:47.008]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:47.168 --> 01:07:51.650]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:55.031]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:55.031 --> 01:08:01.333]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:03.014]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:08:15.439 --> 01:08:31.283]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:31.283 --> 01:08:33.784]  I help the blind to see.
[01:08:33.784 --> 01:08:37.525]  I got no friends.
[01:08:37.525 --> 01:08:40.706]  I got no friends that are idiots to believe mainstream media.
[01:08:40.706 --> 01:08:41.426]  Thank God.
[01:08:43.033 --> 01:08:46.456]  So good to be rejected by the rotting, collapsing establishment.
[01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:47.837]  Gavin McGinnis is a trailblazer.
[01:08:47.837 --> 01:08:50.138]  He started Vice News.
[01:08:50.138 --> 01:08:52.300]  It's now been bought by HBO.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.521]  He's produced major films.
[01:08:54.521 --> 01:08:58.865]  He, of course, is a cultural analyst who is trying to promote the return.
[01:08:59.705 --> 01:09:01.167]  Of men and women.
[01:09:01.167 --> 01:09:06.953]  Everybody else can be whatever group they want to be, but men and women are allowed to exist and men can act like men and women can act like women.
[01:09:06.953 --> 01:09:07.654]  And guess what?
[01:09:07.654 --> 01:09:10.897]  That's popular because that's what mammals do.
[01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:19.186]  And so I wanted to get him on for the next 30 minutes, then we'll take your calls after that, to give us his take on what he thinks the big central issues are in the world today.
[01:09:19.747 --> 01:09:24.451]  I mean, it's clearly the Republicans that are blocking Trump from getting his health care reform in.
[01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:27.473]  The answer is remove them and get more people in the Freedom Caucus.
[01:09:27.473 --> 01:09:29.035]  I want to get his take on that.
[01:09:29.035 --> 01:09:34.339]  I've also got the liberals going more and more insane, calling for free speech to be banned.
[01:09:34.339 --> 01:09:39.143]  We have the Federal Elections Commission calling for a criminal investigation of myself, Drudge, and Breitbart.
[01:09:39.143 --> 01:09:40.765]  That got shot down over the weekend.
[01:09:41.585 --> 01:09:45.329]  But they just said that we shouldn't be allowed to have our speech because we're beating them.
[01:09:45.329 --> 01:09:52.376]  And in this story on InfoWars.com, Swedish Liberal Youth Party wants to legalize necrophilia and child porn.
[01:09:52.376 --> 01:09:55.940]  They also want to make it legal for Muslims to rape women.
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:59.704]  And they also have come out and said they want ruthless mass immigration.
[01:09:59.704 --> 01:10:00.064]  So this is
[01:10:00.965 --> 01:10:09.368]  Cucking that Gavin McGinnis, I think was one of the guys six, seven years ago, pointed out that this cuckolding is what the left is really all about.
[01:10:09.368 --> 01:10:13.329]  He was the first guy I heard six, seven years ago to define it.
[01:10:13.329 --> 01:10:19.571]  Kind of like the sexual situation where a man wants to see two or three guys with his wife or whatever because that excites him.
[01:10:19.571 --> 01:10:20.611]  But this is beyond that.
[01:10:20.611 --> 01:10:22.592]  It's like a form of humiliation.
[01:10:22.592 --> 01:10:27.833]  And so now they're having anti-racism rallies where then the women get raped in mass by the Muslims.
[01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:29.174]  Again, I don't want to bash the Muslims.
[01:10:29.174 --> 01:10:30.414]  They've announced that
[01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:33.477]  We're weak and here to be conquered and taken over.
[01:10:33.477 --> 01:10:36.799]  And so we'll discuss all this with Gavin McGinnis right now.
[01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.401]  Gavin, good to have you on with us.
[01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:40.403]  Thanks for having me.
[01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:41.203]  I always get you on.
[01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:42.324]  We don't do some pre-interview.
[01:10:42.324 --> 01:10:44.346]  We haven't talked since you were on last time.
[01:10:44.346 --> 01:10:47.069]  I threw out a few issues here, but what's front and center for you right now?
[01:10:47.884 --> 01:10:49.425]  Well, all of that is front and center for me.
[01:10:49.425 --> 01:10:51.747]  The war on traditional Western values.
[01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:53.269]  And you know what's happening in Sweden?
[01:10:53.269 --> 01:10:56.091]  I was just talking to that YouTuber, Angry Foreigner.
[01:10:56.091 --> 01:11:02.917]  And he said, the Swedish women, the liberals, the hippies, they've created this masculinity vacuum.
[01:11:02.917 --> 01:11:09.602]  And with no one to have sex with, they're starting to take in these refugees that are called boys, but are really 18.
[01:11:10.923 --> 01:11:24.836]  And these hippie, liberal, feminist women in Sweden are having sex with the teenage boys they take in, in a sick, depraved outcome of smashing traditionalism.
[01:11:24.836 --> 01:11:26.157]  I mean, it's right out of the Bible.
[01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:28.319]  It's Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:11:28.319 --> 01:11:28.899]  It really is.
[01:11:28.899 --> 01:11:31.562]  We go back into these cycles every time.
[01:11:31.562 --> 01:11:32.883]  Have we hit the bottom of it yet?
[01:11:34.119 --> 01:11:34.740]  I don't know.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:37.322]  I don't know if the left will ever be satiated.
[01:11:37.322 --> 01:11:38.564]  I mean, you look at Iran, right?
[01:11:38.564 --> 01:11:42.187]  After 1979, they got everyone in hijabs, everyone in burqas.
[01:11:42.187 --> 01:11:45.350]  They beat you with a cane and they'll kill you if you're gay.
[01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:47.072]  And they're still not satisfied.
[01:11:47.072 --> 01:11:53.959]  They're still giving people fines every day and lashes for daring to not perfectly adhere to Islam.
[01:11:53.959 --> 01:11:55.921]  And I think it shows that both Islam and the left
[01:11:56.321 --> 01:11:58.202]  Are totally insatiable.
[01:11:58.202 --> 01:11:59.602]  I don't think they'll ever be satisfied.
[01:11:59.602 --> 01:12:01.183]  I mean, look what's going on right now.
[01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:03.184]  There was a big talk last week about The Guardian.
[01:12:03.184 --> 01:12:07.725]  They had this article and it said, the best thing you can do for the environment is to stop having babies.
[01:12:07.725 --> 01:12:09.286]  And they show three white kids there.
[01:12:09.286 --> 01:12:12.647]  The only time you don't see diversity in baby pictures.
[01:12:12.647 --> 01:12:16.689]  And then, in the same breath, they're saying, we need more refugees.
[01:12:16.689 --> 01:12:17.629]  Bring in refugees.
[01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:19.630]  We're not replenishing our population.
[01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:22.871]  Now when you juxtapose those two next to each other, what does that say?
[01:12:23.431 --> 01:12:28.272]  It says, let's eradicate ourselves and get replaced.
[01:12:28.272 --> 01:12:28.852]  You're right.
[01:12:28.852 --> 01:12:39.475]  And you know, I was just thinking of a major feminist magazine called Medusa two weeks ago came out and said, if you're white and have a white boyfriend, that's not good because whites are inherently the cause of all problems.
[01:12:39.475 --> 01:12:41.715]  This is white people publishing mainly the magazine.
[01:12:41.715 --> 01:12:44.096]  But if you're having a white baby, abort it.
[01:12:44.096 --> 01:12:47.857]  So it's now a religious sacrament to kill white babies.
[01:12:47.857 --> 01:12:49.617]  I mean, I think we're far from hitting the bottom here.
[01:12:50.717 --> 01:12:51.518]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:12:51.518 --> 01:12:53.139]  I mean, look at South Africa.
[01:12:53.139 --> 01:13:00.785]  I was at a bar the other day, and there was wine vendors trying to sell to the bartender, and he goes, no, I don't want any wine from South Africa.
[01:13:00.785 --> 01:13:03.587]  Now, they abolished apartheid a quarter of a century ago.
[01:13:03.587 --> 01:13:07.450]  Right now, they have a new apartheid where whites can't get up in the world.
[01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:17.738]  They live in these refugee camps, and I'm sorry to make everything racial, but South Africa is a great example of what happens when you decide you're going to declare revenge on a group of people.
[01:13:17.918 --> 01:13:18.699]  Zimbabwe.
[01:13:18.699 --> 01:13:23.824]  Zimbabwe ran out of all the white farmers and now they have what, like 5 million times inflation?
[01:13:23.824 --> 01:13:25.626]  Total and utter decay there.
[01:13:25.626 --> 01:13:29.770]  A cheeseburger in Zimbabwe is 14 million of their dollars.
[01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:33.333]  A long distance call is also in the millions of dollars.
[01:13:33.333 --> 01:13:37.257]  So I keep saying to these liberals who just hate themselves and hate the West,
[01:13:37.717 --> 01:13:39.318]  What do you have to replace it?
[01:13:39.318 --> 01:13:41.139]  I understand you want to sabotage us.
[01:13:41.139 --> 01:13:48.243]  I understand the Women's March is in bed with Linda Sarsour because they see her as an effective weapon in eradicating traditionalism.
[01:13:48.243 --> 01:13:50.044]  But what's your plan B?
[01:13:50.044 --> 01:13:53.686]  And you realize they don't have a plan B. They're just like the Black Bloc.
[01:13:53.686 --> 01:13:54.607]  They're just like Antifa.
[01:13:54.927 --> 01:13:57.410]  They want to burn Western society to the ground.
[01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:58.992]  They want to remove all the statues.
[01:13:58.992 --> 01:14:00.454]  They want to burn all the books.
[01:14:00.454 --> 01:14:04.019]  But they have no plan B. And you know what happens when you do that?
[01:14:04.019 --> 01:14:08.565]  You create a vacuum and a worst case scenario sneaks in and that's Sharia.
[01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.726]  How do you think Trump's doing six months in?
[01:14:12.726 --> 01:14:22.394]  I think he's crushed ISIS, three trillion in the stock market, 60 plus percent reduction in illegals coming across, pulling us out of the carbon taxes.
[01:14:22.394 --> 01:14:28.379]  I mean, other than the Republicans blocking him on tax cuts and Obamacare, I'd give him a 99, basically.
[01:14:30.643 --> 01:14:31.604]  You know, he really is.
[01:14:31.604 --> 01:14:35.607]  I was thinking this morning, he was the Liberals' creation.
[01:14:35.607 --> 01:14:37.669]  He's like the toxic Avenger.
[01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:39.410]  And they say, he's a mutant.
[01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:41.992]  And they keep saying to us, they go, he's not presidential.
[01:14:41.992 --> 01:14:44.294]  And I say, we tried presidential.
[01:14:44.294 --> 01:14:45.535]  We brought you Mitt Romney.
[01:14:45.535 --> 01:14:46.816]  I don't think the guy's ever had a beer.
[01:14:47.336 --> 01:14:48.918]  We brought you Ted Cruz.
[01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:51.641]  I'm not sure he's had sex with anyone but his wife.
[01:14:51.641 --> 01:14:55.304]  Perfect Jesus figures and the media ate them alive.
[01:14:55.304 --> 01:15:01.991]  Alright, so in our lab we created a monster and this beast is just destroying the mainstream media.
[01:15:01.991 --> 01:15:03.773]  I mean, CNN is done now.
[01:15:03.773 --> 01:15:06.176]  And his wife speaks five languages and is like a diplomatic...
[01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:08.537]  What did you think was going to happen, Liberals?
[01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:09.918]  We kept trying to play fair.
[01:15:09.918 --> 01:15:10.778]  You kept cheating.
[01:15:10.778 --> 01:15:13.340]  Alright, we're going to bring out the monsters.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:13.700]  Unleash the Kraken.
[01:15:27.768 --> 01:15:34.391]  And by the way, while he's doing great with all the culture wars, I'm just seeing nothing but jobs and the Dow is up.
[01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:43.636]  I mean, he talked to, there's fun little metrics, like he talked to someone in real estate and they go, I was facing, I was worried about, I'd have to get a new career back before 2016.
[01:15:43.636 --> 01:15:46.877]  And now the houses are just flying off the shelves.
[01:15:46.877 --> 01:15:48.098]  The economy is booming.
[01:15:49.431 --> 01:16:18.659]  That's what, that's my biggest issue is, every metric shows, we went from going into a depression, a recession in most areas, to now the engine's turning back on, it's sputtering some, but it's roaring back to life, and they're going, no, no, no, no, take your foot off the accelerator, no, no, no, no, turn it off, and every metric shows that the economy's coming back, and we're crushing radical Islam, and we're, you're bringing in immigrants that, you know, that don't have criminal records, we're doing common sense things, and they're just freaking out.
[01:16:19.827 --> 01:16:22.189]  Well, you know, leaders have a lot of power.
[01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:27.553]  And my ideal scenario is there is no White House, there is no Department of Education, there is no Department of Energy.
[01:16:27.553 --> 01:16:28.854]  It's all privatized.
[01:16:28.854 --> 01:16:30.995]  But you need someone doing something.
[01:16:30.995 --> 01:16:35.459]  And if you look up in Canada, you can see what happens when you have an incompetent leader.
[01:16:35.459 --> 01:16:41.163]  He's giving $10 million to a terrorist, Omar Khadr, whose family lived with Osama bin Laden.
[01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:50.411]  Tell folks about this guy because he's letting people out of prison that reportedly have killed unarmed medics in the army.
[01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:51.812]  Tell folks about this.
[01:16:51.812 --> 01:16:54.334]  He killed Chris Spears.
[01:16:54.334 --> 01:16:57.797]  I think it was a Marine who was trying to save him.
[01:16:57.797 --> 01:16:59.779]  He shot a medic in the eye.
[01:17:00.719 --> 01:17:02.861]  He's lost his vision in that eye.
[01:17:02.861 --> 01:17:17.814]  Yet, when we get there, this terrorist who was throwing bombs at Americans, we pick him up, we air helicopter him to Germany, we fix his eye, then he goes to Abu Ghraib because he's a terrorist, and Canada is so embarrassed that he had an uncomfortable time there.
[01:17:17.814 --> 01:17:18.975]  Meanwhile, he said, killing Chris
[01:17:19.155 --> 01:17:19.375]  I think?
[01:17:36.104 --> 01:17:37.606]  by funding terrorism.
[01:17:37.606 --> 01:17:40.428]  So these leaders can screw up your life.
[01:17:40.428 --> 01:17:45.052]  Look at Obama with Title IX, where he rewarded colleges for finding rapists.
[01:17:45.052 --> 01:17:48.175]  So the next thing you know, there's a rapist under every stone.
[01:17:48.175 --> 01:17:49.877]  I hate all politicians.
[01:17:49.877 --> 01:17:53.680]  I like Trump the best because he seems to hate them too, the way Reagan does.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:18:00.326]  But these guys with their maniacal spending hurts Americans.
[01:18:00.326 --> 01:18:01.407]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:18:02.148 --> 01:18:05.151]  Looking at Canada, Trudeau says stop being America first.
[01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:08.975]  It doesn't mean we want to hurt Canada, or hurt Japan, or hurt Mexico.
[01:18:08.975 --> 01:18:14.701]  If your country isn't for you first, and your interest where you pay taxes, there's no such thing as citizenship.
[01:18:14.701 --> 01:18:17.745]  Globalism is where these multinationals are tax exempt.
[01:18:17.745 --> 01:18:20.588]  They have their own country, country crony capitalism.
[01:18:20.908 --> 01:18:23.252]  And then you pay for everything and you have no rights.
[01:18:23.252 --> 01:18:28.520]  How did they ever sell the idea that we should ditch America first and that that somehow was bad?
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:33.287]  If your country isn't first for you, if you're not first in your life, then who is?
[01:18:34.508 --> 01:18:35.589]  How did we get here?
[01:18:35.589 --> 01:18:43.717]  Remember Trump was in Poland and he was getting attacked for praising symphonies, which apparently is racist, and praising Western society.
[01:18:43.717 --> 01:18:47.640]  And Noah Rothman wrote a great article about this where he said, how did we get here?
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:54.046]  We have the left criticizing what is basically Clintonian centrism.
[01:18:54.046 --> 01:18:57.770]  If you listen to a Clinton speech in 94 about illegal immigration,
[01:18:57.930 --> 01:18:59.550]  Sounds way stricter than Trump.
[01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:00.851]  He was anti-gay marriage.
[01:19:00.851 --> 01:19:04.972]  Trump is more left-wing than 1994 Clinton in many ways.
[01:19:04.972 --> 01:19:08.132]  And he said, we also have liberals defending jihad.
[01:19:08.132 --> 01:19:12.473]  When Sarsour declares jihad in America, they go, well, jihad can be good.
[01:19:12.473 --> 01:19:21.215]  And then lastly, they have them criticizing what is basically just normal American politics, defending the Western world.
[01:19:21.215 --> 01:19:25.196]  And the left is saying, no, any defense of the West is vaguely racist.
[01:19:25.516 --> 01:19:25.957]  That's right.
[01:19:25.957 --> 01:19:26.898]  This is bullying.
[01:19:26.898 --> 01:19:28.460]  All free speech into non-existence.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.342]  One more segment with Gavin McGinnis.
[01:19:30.342 --> 01:19:33.486]  He, of course, is joining us live via Skype right now.
[01:19:33.486 --> 01:19:37.831]  We'll be back, but let's go out with the sacrilege that Donald Trump engaged in.
[01:19:38.959 --> 01:19:48.361]  Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken.
[01:19:48.361 --> 01:19:56.924]  Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.
[01:19:56.924 --> 01:20:01.665]  Meanwhile, the major Islamist groups are openly chanting and saying they're going to bring us down and that's their goal.
[01:20:15.111 --> 01:20:17.452]  About 200 bucks a month.

[01:24:08.223 --> 01:24:11.607]  Final segment with Gavin McInnes is with the Rebel Media.
[01:24:11.607 --> 01:24:14.550]  Then I'm going to open the phones up in the next segment and get to a ton of news.
[01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:29.927]  Gavin, we were talking during the break, hopefully we can recreate that for TV viewers and radio listeners right now, about the cult-like nature of the so-called left, who behave like a bunch of anti-free speech fascists, and who openly want to dominate and control all of society.
[01:24:31.707 --> 01:24:37.113]  And we were talking about the fact that there are a bunch of followers in a cult and they're only getting more extreme.
[01:24:37.113 --> 01:24:42.380]  And you were breaking down some of your experiences with your old liberal friends.
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.262]  Please repeat that.
[01:24:44.938 --> 01:24:50.703]  Well, I'm a member of the funny community, so a lot of my friends were liberals, comedians.
[01:24:50.703 --> 01:24:51.984]  That goes without saying.
[01:24:51.984 --> 01:24:56.088]  If you're a comedian in 2017, you're liberal, especially in New York City.
[01:24:56.088 --> 01:24:59.190]  And, you know, when Obama was elected, I wasn't thrilled.
[01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:04.035]  I didn't like that you were treating him like the messiah, just because he's black.
[01:25:04.035 --> 01:25:06.597]  And I knew that he was going to screw up the country, and I hated all this.
[01:25:06.997 --> 01:25:08.177]  But you also told me privately that
[01:25:37.918 --> 01:25:42.279]  Most of your old friends do say, listen, I know you're right, but I got to keep my job.
[01:25:42.279 --> 01:25:43.539]  They know it's a cult.
[01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:44.840]  They're afraid.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.740]  That's why they're not talking to you.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.040]  Yes.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:47.320]  Sorry.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.000]  There's, there's different groups within that.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.381]  So there's the group that is totally brainwashed and they go, you're evil.
[01:25:52.381 --> 01:25:53.982]  We can't be around you anymore.
[01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.442]  Get lost Nazi.
[01:25:55.442 --> 01:26:00.183]  And then there's a, maybe a 30% contingent within that, where they go, look, I agree with you.
[01:26:00.183 --> 01:26:03.364]  I love America, but I, I can't be seen with you right now.
[01:26:03.364 --> 01:26:04.884]  Uh, it's bad for my career.
[01:26:05.484 --> 01:26:10.506]  And you'd go, I'd understand if I was a Nazi, if I was a racist, if I was a homophobe.
[01:26:10.506 --> 01:26:11.827]  You might have a point.
[01:26:11.827 --> 01:26:17.369]  But you're basing all this on rumors from some anonymous blog and you're... It's beyond that.
[01:26:17.369 --> 01:26:18.169]  It's bullying.
[01:26:18.169 --> 01:26:18.929]  It's weaponized.
[01:26:18.929 --> 01:26:20.690]  They're saying, we know you didn't do this.
[01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:21.831]  We know you're not a witch.
[01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:23.471]  But we're going to say you are.
[01:26:23.471 --> 01:26:26.412]  If you don't agree to whatever we say, we're going to shun you.
[01:26:26.412 --> 01:26:27.793]  We're going to outcast you.
[01:26:27.793 --> 01:26:28.993]  We're going to call you horrible names.
[01:26:28.993 --> 01:26:30.754]  We're going to say you're a Russian agent.
[01:26:30.754 --> 01:26:32.195]  Now they've got members of Congress.
[01:26:33.274 --> 01:26:42.601]  Like Congressman Quigley, literally, his name's Quigley of Illinois, saying, if you talk to any Russian, you're talking to Putin, and no one's allowed to talk to Russians.
[01:26:42.601 --> 01:26:44.523]  That's a quote from Friday.
[01:26:45.794 --> 01:26:51.876]  Look, if you're the President's son and you hear a rumor that someone has dirt on Hillary, please pursue it.
[01:26:51.876 --> 01:26:53.216]  I want to hear about it.
[01:26:53.216 --> 01:26:59.178]  It's your job as a public figure to pursue something very juicy.
[01:26:59.178 --> 01:27:02.139]  Hillary was looking for dirt from the Russians on Trump.
[01:27:02.139 --> 01:27:03.840]  It's all complete hoax!
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.540]  Especially Hillary!
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.541]  Every time we hear there's dirt, it's something huge!
[01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:09.901]  Benghazi was huge!
[01:27:09.901 --> 01:27:11.561]  The emails were huge!
[01:27:11.561 --> 01:27:13.081]  Seth Rich is huge!
[01:27:13.081 --> 01:27:14.722]  Vince Foster's huge!
[01:27:14.722 --> 01:27:17.662]  I want to know, if you have a secret about Hillary, tell me about it.
[01:27:17.662 --> 01:27:22.063]  But one thing I want to get back to what we were saying earlier, look at our radical views that we have.
[01:27:22.063 --> 01:27:23.743]  We like the Western world.
[01:27:23.743 --> 01:27:26.564]  You know, the world everyone is trying to get to.
[01:27:26.564 --> 01:27:28.944]  We also oppose Sharia law.
[01:27:28.944 --> 01:27:33.425]  We had a rally in New York City about a month ago, and there's all these people showing up to protest us.
[01:27:34.065 --> 01:27:35.766]  For opposing Sharia!
[01:27:35.766 --> 01:27:43.368]  And you go, I chose Sharia as a very hyperbolic example of a worst-case scenario, and you don't even accept that.
[01:27:43.368 --> 01:27:48.750]  I choose the West as something I think we could all agree on, and you don't even agree on that.
[01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:50.411]  So they are the radicals!
[01:27:50.411 --> 01:28:00.494]  They've gone so far left that they're like some weird purple-haired feminist from your college days, and they've mainstreamed it, and now you're a freak for having basically the same views as your old man!
[01:28:00.494 --> 01:28:01.015]  Exactly!
[01:28:01.015 --> 01:28:02.355]  We've always been tolerant!
[01:28:02.435 --> 01:28:08.664]  We're the real liberals, and they're trying to make us conform to their new weird, bizarre orthodoxy.
[01:28:08.664 --> 01:28:10.546]  They're like the most crazed street preachers.
[01:28:10.546 --> 01:28:17.176]  And I'm not bashing street preachers in general, but some of the ones that scream at you with bad breath and, you know, do more harm than good, that's how the left is.
[01:28:17.176 --> 01:28:19.259]  It's like crazed street preachers.
[01:28:20.413 --> 01:28:23.354]  And it's just so weird that they don't call you first.
[01:28:23.354 --> 01:28:27.896]  I mean, David Cross, he's a comedian and we were best friends for a long time.
[01:28:27.896 --> 01:28:31.798]  He did text me and he goes, hey, were you Zeke Hiling at Deplorable?
[01:28:31.798 --> 01:28:38.181]  And I go, no, dude, that's a fucking screen, excuse my language, that's a screen grab where I was gesticulating and someone froze it.
[01:28:38.181 --> 01:28:40.602]  I won't even do it now or they'll do it again.
[01:28:40.602 --> 01:28:44.504]  But besides him, everyone else just goes, oh, well, he's a Nazi.
[01:28:44.744 --> 01:28:45.785]  And they don't even text you.
[01:28:45.785 --> 01:28:53.372]  This is when your kids have been playing together, when you've been on vacation together for years, and they just X you like you've left the Scientology church.
[01:28:53.372 --> 01:28:56.355]  But it shows they were never really their friends.
[01:28:56.355 --> 01:28:58.076]  They were never really your friend.
[01:28:58.076 --> 01:29:03.562]  They were all just trying to social climb in the whole fake liberal corporate monstrosity.
[01:29:04.511 --> 01:29:10.717]  If I found out, if there was a story going on that you murdered someone, I would text you and go, Alex, what's going on here?
[01:29:10.717 --> 01:29:11.518]  Is this true?
[01:29:11.518 --> 01:29:13.620]  I wouldn't just go, oops, there's the murderer.
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:17.423]  Now that's murder, a felony, a serious offense.
[01:29:17.423 --> 01:29:21.207]  We're just supporting Trump, liking the West, and objecting.
[01:29:22.128 --> 01:29:22.428]  I think so.
[01:29:45.103 --> 01:29:46.665]  Thanks Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:29:46.665 --> 01:29:50.471]  I just made total sense of everything he said, but again that's radical, that's evil.
[01:29:50.471 --> 01:29:57.221]  No, they're selling tyranny so they can't have reasonable stuff exist because it discredits the garbage.
[01:29:57.221 --> 01:29:59.904]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:08.692]  We must keep the Internet free from communistic government restrictions and parameters.
[01:30:08.692 --> 01:30:09.313]  Why?
[01:30:09.313 --> 01:30:11.735]  Because it would stop memes and erase heroes.
[01:30:11.735 --> 01:30:12.636]  Don't believe me?
[01:30:12.636 --> 01:30:13.597]  Look at China.
[01:30:13.597 --> 01:30:21.425]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously memed with Barack Obama in 2013, when a picture of the two was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, too.
[01:30:21.425 --> 01:30:27.311]  This happened again after an awkward handshake with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Eeyore.
[01:30:27.731 --> 01:30:32.415]  Other images, such as Winnie the Pooh in a car, have been memed alongside President Xi in his limo.
[01:30:32.415 --> 01:30:37.579]  But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular, China has now censored it from the Internet.
[01:30:37.579 --> 01:30:39.400]  This is commonplace in Communist China.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:46.946]  As a recently deceased political dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo has had his name completely censored from the virtual world.
[01:30:46.946 --> 01:30:51.369]  Try sending his name in a message to a friend, and the message will disappear into cyberspace.
[01:30:51.369 --> 01:30:55.132]  Xiaobo died in Chinese custody, and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[01:30:55.532 --> 01:30:57.095]  Keep the internet free in America.
[01:30:57.095 --> 01:30:58.296]  Stop net neutrality.
[01:30:58.296 --> 01:30:59.158]  Save meme magic.
[01:30:59.158 --> 01:31:01.802]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:31:04.150 --> 01:31:09.855]  Rediscover your fire with the EcoZoom Coal Rocket Camping Stove.

[01:31:21.024 --> 01:31:27.049]  The Versa cooks fast, it produces less smoke, and it's fuel efficient.
[01:31:27.049 --> 01:31:31.213]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.
[01:31:31.633 --> 01:31:37.679]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.
[01:31:37.679 --> 01:31:44.265]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal and you got yourself an entire meal.

[01:32:06.879 --> 01:32:08.319]  Let's go to Dabbin' in Florida.
[01:32:08.319 --> 01:32:09.160]  Dabbin' in Florida.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:09.560]  You're on the air.
[01:32:10.549 --> 01:32:11.009]  Great!
[01:32:11.009 --> 01:32:12.110]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:16.653]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:32:16.653 --> 01:32:18.354]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:32:18.354 --> 01:32:25.939]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:32:25.939 --> 01:32:26.819]  Wow, thank you.
[01:32:26.819 --> 01:32:29.161]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:32:29.161 --> 01:32:30.722]  Which Nutra-Certical does he like best?
[01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:34.443]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:32:34.443 --> 01:32:35.723]  That's really incredible.
[01:32:35.723 --> 01:32:39.104]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:32:39.104 --> 01:32:40.124]  I haven't felt asleep.
[01:32:40.124 --> 01:32:41.785]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:32:41.785 --> 01:32:43.025]  And I love you guys.
[01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:45.186]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[01:32:45.186 --> 01:32:52.047]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:32:52.047 --> 01:32:53.087]  You will love it.
[01:32:53.087 --> 01:32:54.908]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[01:32:55.208 --> 01:32:59.658]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:01.302]  It's a win-win, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:06.235 --> 01:33:08.877]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:08.877 --> 01:33:14.982]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:14.982 --> 01:33:24.510]  I wondered so aimless, life filled with sin, I wouldn't let my dear Savior in.
[01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:28.773]  Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night,
[01:33:31.535 --> 01:33:35.137]  It's a good thing to see the light.
[01:33:35.137 --> 01:33:42.843]  No more fear of the devil, of the world, of the petty people that are obsessed with the system.
[01:33:42.843 --> 01:33:45.825]  The world is still here, but you're not part of it.
[01:33:45.825 --> 01:33:48.127]  It's amazing.
[01:33:48.127 --> 01:33:50.548]  And then you see the world for what it really is.
[01:33:50.548 --> 01:33:52.210]  You see the beauty clearer.
[01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:54.791]  You see the ugliness and evil clearer.
[01:33:54.791 --> 01:33:55.972]  You have discernment.
[01:33:55.972 --> 01:33:56.733]  You're born again.
[01:33:59.821 --> 01:34:07.587]  There's a false spirit in most of these churches, though, of magical thinking, of Satanism.
[01:34:07.587 --> 01:34:09.589]  It's amazing to watch it.
[01:34:09.589 --> 01:34:23.880]  Before we go any further here, I just want to let listeners know that I am very, very excited about the fact that we've been carrying these little, very inexpensive, colloidal silver impregnated toothbrushes that are one of our best sellers.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.422]  Even though I never plug them, I personally use them.
[01:34:26.422 --> 01:34:27.863]  And they're super inexpensive.
[01:34:28.814 --> 01:34:30.515]  They're $4.99.
[01:34:30.515 --> 01:34:34.118]  We've got three packs of them, you name it.
[01:34:34.118 --> 01:34:40.964]  And that way, you're not just, you know, putting the bad bacteria and things back on the brush, that even hot water doesn't really get off.
[01:34:40.964 --> 01:34:44.447]  It's dying, so the brush is really clean and healthy.
[01:34:44.447 --> 01:34:50.452]  And if you've been sick, then you don't have to throw away the toothbrush, because, you know, the colloidal silver is killing it, so you can reuse it.
[01:34:50.452 --> 01:34:53.355]  You might want to still throw it away, they're still inexpensive.
[01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:56.998]  I go through a lot of these toothbrushes, and then I noticed, I said, I love this company,
[01:34:59.241 --> 01:35:00.222]  Do they have other toothbrushes?
[01:35:00.222 --> 01:35:06.607]  And I said, yeah, they have a travel toothbrush with silver and they have a mechanical toothbrush.
[01:35:06.607 --> 01:35:10.330]  And it's so inexpensive.
[01:35:10.330 --> 01:35:11.331]  That's what blew me away.
[01:35:11.331 --> 01:35:15.874]  We'll put it up on screen for TV viewers and for radio listeners.
[01:35:15.874 --> 01:35:19.638]  But it is the Mouthwashers toothbrush.
[01:35:19.638 --> 01:35:26.523]  It's available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:26.523 --> 01:35:28.425]  Also, it goes great with
[01:35:29.648 --> 01:35:37.753]  Super Blue Non-Fluoride Toothpaste with Iodine and Nano Silver.
[01:35:37.753 --> 01:35:42.896]  So again, those are the normal anti-microbial adult toothbrush for $4.99.
[01:35:42.896 --> 01:35:51.020]  These are the mechanical toothbrushes for $19.95 that is available exclusively at m4warstore.com.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:57.504]  When you get it exclusively with the Super Blue toothpaste, there is a big discount on the Advanced Oral Care Pack.
[01:35:58.004 --> 01:36:04.596]  Where you get the 10 to 1 organic mouthwash, 10 to 1 concentrate, the super blue, and the mechanical toothbrush.
[01:36:04.596 --> 01:36:10.185]  The only one of its type with the impregnated silver in it as well.
[01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:19.152]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:19.152 --> 01:36:27.333]  Again, introducing the new Mouth Watchers Power Toothbrush and Advanced Oral Care Pack, now available at infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:27.333 --> 01:36:30.554]  It's $24.95 by itself, and you get it with the toothpaste.
[01:36:30.554 --> 01:36:31.334]  It's $19.95.
[01:36:31.334 --> 01:36:39.196]  The Mouth Watchers Power Toothbrush offers a unique 3D action, while the revolutionary anti-microbial dual-layer silver flossing bristles
[01:36:39.696 --> 01:36:43.619]  Reach into areas untouched by prior toothbrushes for deep cleansing.
[01:36:43.619 --> 01:36:49.602]  The gentle oscillations leave teeth and gums feeling just as clean as after professional gentle cleansing.
[01:36:49.602 --> 01:36:54.806]  The revolutionary flossing bristle operates at 50,000 oscillations per minute with up and down motion.
[01:36:55.586 --> 01:36:57.827]  It's high quality, but very, very affordable.
[01:36:57.827 --> 01:37:03.970]  The advanced flossing bristle brushes away cavities, genzovitis, causing food and plaque buildup.
[01:37:03.970 --> 01:37:11.133]  The advanced oral care pack contains one of these new power toothbrushes, a tube of super glue toothpaste, and a bottle of Emrix Essentials Organic Mouthwash.
[01:37:11.133 --> 01:37:14.355]  This is all you need for the ultimate in oral care.
[01:37:14.355 --> 01:37:16.075]  Available at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:23.913]  I've got free shipping on top of that throughout the month of July that ends in about 13 days.
[01:37:23.913 --> 01:37:36.042]  And on top of that, we're going to have to pull the BrainForce Plus from the 30% off because it's about to sell out, SuperMetal Vitality X2 and more.
[01:37:36.042 --> 01:37:37.964]  But we're going to add some other things on to sale.
[01:37:38.784 --> 01:37:41.305]  For 20-30% off, as I promised to do, right through the month.
[01:37:41.305 --> 01:37:45.207]  So we're going to have to end that sale in two days on those particular items.
[01:37:45.207 --> 01:37:47.469]  I want to thank you all for your purchases.
[01:37:47.469 --> 01:37:48.849]  They make the broadcast possible.
[01:37:48.849 --> 01:37:56.433]  But we try to bring you really game-changing, high-quality products that we personally test and use at very competitive prices to fund our operation.
[01:37:56.433 --> 01:37:59.375]  A true 360 win at every level.
[01:38:00.273 --> 01:38:08.035]  Now, I'd like to give out the toll-free number to take some phone calls ahead of our next guest joining us a little bit into the next hour.
[01:38:08.035 --> 01:38:15.876]  He's the individual, the scientist, the entrepreneur, who's started and launched multi, you know, $100 million companies.
[01:38:15.876 --> 01:38:17.457]  He's not another politician or lawyer.
[01:38:17.457 --> 01:38:20.778]  Not knocking all the lawyers, but we don't need 80% of Congress to be lawyers.
[01:38:23.331 --> 01:38:24.572]  We'll be joining us.
[01:38:24.572 --> 01:38:25.872]  Dr. Shiva will be joining us.
[01:38:25.872 --> 01:38:27.012]  Shiva for the U.S.
[01:38:27.012 --> 01:38:35.096]  Senate, who has now broken through on mainstream news, is doing very well in the polls, and has the Democrats in Pocahontas shaking in their boots.
[01:38:35.096 --> 01:38:37.216]  What do you think of Ken Rock running?
[01:38:37.216 --> 01:38:38.397]  He's a libertarian conservative.
[01:38:38.397 --> 01:38:39.257]  He wants free market.
[01:38:39.257 --> 01:38:39.877]  He's a Trumper.
[01:38:39.877 --> 01:38:42.499]  I know he's friends with Jesse James, a friend of mine.
[01:38:42.499 --> 01:38:43.299]  Says he's a great guy.
[01:38:43.299 --> 01:38:45.019]  What do you think of him getting ready to run?
[01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:45.980]  I know it has the Democrats
[01:38:47.426 --> 01:38:48.107]  Scared as well.
[01:38:48.107 --> 01:38:48.167]  800-259-9231.
[01:38:48.167 --> 01:38:48.227]  800-259-9231.
[01:38:48.227 --> 01:38:49.768]  We will get you up and on the air.
[01:38:49.768 --> 01:38:53.251]  Now, before I go any further, let me get into some of these video clips.
[01:39:05.401 --> 01:39:13.128]  We have Bernstein of Woodward and Bernstein that totally set up Nixon by the deep state because Nixon was trying to turn our economy on.
[01:39:13.128 --> 01:39:23.598]  Busted him for some two-bit burgling idiocy of G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt and a few others who were shut up by the CIA that were surveilling everything they did.
[01:39:23.598 --> 01:39:25.560]  That's all been declassified.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.323]  He's coming out saying, Trussia rump collusion.
[01:39:30.526 --> 01:39:34.827]  We are in the midst of a cold civil war in this country.
[01:39:34.827 --> 01:39:36.928]  Oh, when he says that it's big national news.
[01:39:36.928 --> 01:39:39.328]  I told you we were in a civil war during the campaign.
[01:39:39.328 --> 01:39:49.931]  I told you we're going into a hot civil war with Democrats trying to start a real one and calling for violence and hashtag hunt Republicans and all the rest of the garbage.
[01:39:49.931 --> 01:39:55.373]  And then that ties into another clip I'm going to get to with Vanity Fair's Eric Eichenwald
[01:39:56.658 --> 01:40:00.099]  Saying that Fox News is aiding and abetting the Russians.
[01:40:00.099 --> 01:40:02.320]  So now Fox is in bed with the Russians.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:08.722]  This is what I keep telling the Republicans and the Murdoch sons and all of them.
[01:40:08.722 --> 01:40:14.104]  I know you want to be cool with all the New York High Society garbage where all you narcissist mummies go.
[01:40:14.104 --> 01:40:15.485]  All your facelifts.
[01:40:15.485 --> 01:40:18.226]  All your unhappy families.
[01:40:18.226 --> 01:40:18.826]  All your failure.
[01:40:20.109 --> 01:40:21.590]  They're going to bring everything down.
[01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:24.892]  The globalists do not want any freedom or even fake conservatism out there.
[01:40:24.892 --> 01:40:26.213]  They don't want any opposition.
[01:40:26.213 --> 01:40:31.397]  Because globalism is so unpopular, it can only work if there's no opposition.
[01:40:31.397 --> 01:40:38.562]  And so all these Republicans trying to go along with this fake Republican witch hunt that won't go after Hillary for all of her real Russia and China connections?
[01:40:38.562 --> 01:40:42.104]  You are sticking your own stupid necks in a guillotine, morons.
[01:40:42.104 --> 01:40:48.409]  The Democrats had announced they wanted you to be a failed party and only a regional party and loyal opposition.
[01:40:49.554 --> 01:40:51.396]  They want it all shut down.
[01:40:51.396 --> 01:41:07.070]  And so Trump and the American people, we, together must defeat the Republican fake rhinos, the neocons, the establishment liberals, Hollywood, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, the multinationals that want to sew up the global economy and don't want prosperity.
[01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.911]  It's that simple.
[01:41:09.019 --> 01:41:14.585]  When they told Trump you could never turn the economy back on, he knew he could because they had their foot on our neck.
[01:41:14.585 --> 01:41:16.266]  They want a global slowdown.
[01:41:16.266 --> 01:41:18.348]  They admitted that in 2008.
[01:41:18.348 --> 01:41:20.050]  They admitted that in 2010.
[01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:25.395]  They admitted it in 2015, when Obama went to Africa and said, you can't have a good life.
[01:41:25.395 --> 01:41:28.158]  But I'm gonna have one!
[01:41:28.158 --> 01:41:30.961]  They're institutionalizing poverty!
[01:41:30.961 --> 01:41:32.783]  They're institutionalizing garbage!
[01:41:34.679 --> 01:41:38.962]  I didn't come and set this up to be a loser and be on the sidelines.
[01:41:38.962 --> 01:41:44.046]  I came to sell and promote freedom and free market next to globalism.
[01:41:44.046 --> 01:42:02.161]  I know it would win and it's starting to gain traction because if you spread the word globally, from Greece to Poland to Ukraine to France to Germany to the UK to the United States to Australia to Catalonia and Spain, we're on the march.
[01:42:02.161 --> 01:42:03.522]  The empire is on the run.
[01:42:09.346 --> 01:42:13.048]  We can do it together, ladies and gentlemen, but we've got to have eye of the tiger.
[01:42:13.048 --> 01:42:32.800]  I did a really important segment in the first 30 minutes of the broadcast today where I laid out mainline news after the fact that bots, a bot is just a term for major computer spiders, going out, tracking data, collating it, and putting it through AI algorithms.
[01:42:33.729 --> 01:42:35.030]  Robots, basically.
[01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.770]  Robots.
[01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:45.034]  AI analyzing that Trump was 10 to 20 points ahead the entire general election.
[01:42:45.034 --> 01:42:51.257]  That's how I said he was going to win if we could stop them from stealing it.
[01:42:51.257 --> 01:42:53.398]  And now they're back out with the same fake polls again.
[01:42:54.457 --> 01:42:57.640]  Eight months later, nine months later, they think you're dumb and don't remember it.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.323]  So we've got to bring all those articles back.
[01:43:00.323 --> 01:43:02.325]  We've got to expose all that again.
[01:43:02.325 --> 01:43:03.867]  These are the weapon systems.
[01:43:03.867 --> 01:43:06.329]  This will defeat them.
[01:43:06.329 --> 01:43:11.735]  Of course Trump listened to me during the campaign and after, because Trump knows I've got my head screwed on straight.
[01:43:11.735 --> 01:43:15.759]  Bannon, his chief advisor, is basically an older version of me.
[01:43:15.759 --> 01:43:17.521]  All I'm doing is promoting Americana!
[01:43:19.502 --> 01:43:29.827]  You know, Marilyn Monroe, 57 Chevys, moon launch, low taxes, nice houses, swimming pools, good medicine, free open societies!
[01:43:29.827 --> 01:43:32.008]  But the nihilists want to undermine it.
[01:43:32.008 --> 01:43:33.089]  I'm going to get to that a little bit later.
[01:43:33.089 --> 01:43:35.290]  I keep saying I am, but I haven't got to it yet.
[01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:38.952]  The nihilists want to undermine it, and I'm going to explain the paradigm.
[01:43:38.952 --> 01:43:43.234]  How they're the useful idiots.
[01:43:43.234 --> 01:43:45.215]  How they're the people that want to live in the limelight.
[01:43:46.291 --> 01:43:47.652]  The universal dream.
[01:43:47.652 --> 01:43:55.439]  And if they can't live in the limelight through existential envy, they're going to pull down anybody who's successful.
[01:43:55.439 --> 01:44:05.407]  Instead of getting in to, quote, rush to the wonderment and the magic of the universe and the universalness of empowering everybody who will be empowered.
[01:44:05.407 --> 01:44:06.428]  But there's a double-edged sword.
[01:44:06.428 --> 01:44:14.035]  You've got to crush those that try to stop you from becoming empowered and trying to bring you down because they don't want you to be successful.
[01:44:17.538 --> 01:44:24.286]  Envy, jealousy is the great destroyer.
[01:44:24.286 --> 01:44:33.517]  So, here is Bernstein, the paragon, the mountain of journalistic power!
[01:44:34.249 --> 01:44:49.036]  Perched pathetically, swollen, both in reality and figuratively, there on CNN and MSNBC and all these channels that he goes and pontificates from about, we are now in a civil war.
[01:44:49.036 --> 01:44:51.837]  Russia has brought us into great crisis.
[01:44:51.837 --> 01:45:02.362]  And I told you, the enemy, they say, isn't the liberals, it's not the conservatives, it's not whether you want low taxes or high taxes, it's Russia, the all-powerful evil.
[01:45:03.271 --> 01:45:05.593]  The globalists are the outsiders.
[01:45:05.593 --> 01:45:06.675]  They're the cancer.
[01:45:06.675 --> 01:45:07.696]  They're the poison.
[01:45:07.696 --> 01:45:09.057]  They're the people that came in.
[01:45:09.057 --> 01:45:12.721]  They're the people that are usurping us and saying, we can't have a nation.
[01:45:12.721 --> 01:45:13.962]  We can't have America first.
[01:45:13.962 --> 01:45:15.224]  We can't have families.
[01:45:15.224 --> 01:45:16.685]  We can't keep our tax money.
[01:45:16.685 --> 01:45:18.187]  We've got to be under their control.
[01:45:18.187 --> 01:45:23.693]  We've got to do what they say because they crave the control.
[01:45:23.693 --> 01:45:24.534]  And now they tell us.
[01:45:26.010 --> 01:45:29.072]  We're in a civil war, and Russia's behind it.
[01:45:29.072 --> 01:45:30.873]  But don't worry, they're the guardians.
[01:45:30.873 --> 01:45:32.293]  They'll decide who's good.
[01:45:32.293 --> 01:45:34.094]  They'll decide who's a heretic.
[01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:35.695]  They'll decide who's a witch.
[01:45:35.695 --> 01:45:39.357]  They'll decide who can have a radio show, who can be on TV.
[01:45:39.357 --> 01:45:42.058]  They'll decide!
[01:45:42.058 --> 01:45:46.220]  Just like last week, I couldn't believe I was reading it with a straight face.
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:48.381]  New York Times, Washington Post, straight face.
[01:45:48.381 --> 01:45:50.543]  Warren Buffett.
[01:45:50.543 --> 01:45:52.103]  Carlos Slim.
[01:45:52.103 --> 01:45:52.824]  Jeff Bezos.
[01:45:54.062 --> 01:46:15.670]  Three of the richest men in the world are all in the top five, controlling multi-trillion dollar operations, coming in, looking at you with a straight face and saying, we need Congress to shut down alternative media because it's too popular and we want Google to be ordered Congress to force feed our newspapers because they've all gone bankrupt.
[01:46:20.632 --> 01:46:22.214]  Yes.
[01:46:22.214 --> 01:46:31.725]  Imagine a restaurant where they make you go to the restaurant, they make you pay for it, and then they feed you... basically rotten rats.
[01:46:34.175 --> 01:46:41.182]  They force rotten, furry, stinking rats with maggots coming out of their eyeballs, out of their hind ends.
[01:46:41.182 --> 01:46:43.945]  They cram those in your mouth and go, wouldn't that taste good?
[01:46:43.945 --> 01:46:45.166]  Want some more CNN?
[01:46:45.166 --> 01:46:53.695]  Here, let's have a big, fat, juicy, maggot-stuffed, rotting, rotting rat, right at the pinnacle of its stench and bloated.
[01:46:54.756 --> 01:46:58.501]  And reanimated, filled with the maggots of lies.
[01:46:58.501 --> 01:47:08.175]  Yes, bouncing back from death only for a brief second as a facsimile of its once living vestige, now only of other scrofulous creatures.
[01:47:08.175 --> 01:47:10.939]  Let's go ahead and go to Bernstein on Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:47:10.939 --> 01:47:11.259]  Here it is.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:21.123]  The difference between Watergate and now, one of the big differences is that we are in the midst of a cold civil war in this country.
[01:47:21.123 --> 01:47:23.764]  A political and cultural civil war.
[01:47:23.764 --> 01:47:29.306]  And all of our reporting is taking place in the context of that cold civil war.
[01:47:29.306 --> 01:47:32.907]  Nothing quite like that existed at the time of Watergate.
[01:47:33.387 --> 01:47:33.447]  I'm
[01:47:49.142 --> 01:47:49.563]  Okay.
[01:48:06.926 --> 01:48:11.709]  So you're the leftist counter force that says we shouldn't use the word mother and father in schools.
[01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:14.350]  You're the counter force saying we gotta pay for everybody's sex change.
[01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:21.134]  You're the counter force that says we gotta bring in unlimited illegals, then fill them full of anti-American hate and bring in unvetted radical Muslims.
[01:48:21.134 --> 01:48:23.735]  You're the folks that don't want tax cuts for the middle class.
[01:48:23.735 --> 01:48:31.559]  You're the people that wanted us to sign on to the TPP and transfer our sovereignty to a secret group and be the only major nation paying carbon taxes.
[01:48:31.559 --> 01:48:33.140]  You wanted us to do all this.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:36.501]  And then you go, oh look, Fox News did change things.
[01:48:36.501 --> 01:48:41.924]  Fox News, New Talk Radio, had a much bigger audience than all of cable news combined.
[01:48:41.924 --> 01:48:42.945]  They knew there was a market.
[01:48:42.945 --> 01:48:46.907]  So they created Fox News to control the conservative movement.
[01:48:46.907 --> 01:48:52.850]  And now there's a civil war in Fox because Hannity and a few other people are true to what they want to do.
[01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:54.091]  Like Tucker Carlson.
[01:48:55.026 --> 01:49:01.291]  There are a few people on there like Lou Dobbs, Judge Napolitano, there's a handful, and they kind of stick them on the back bench.
[01:49:01.291 --> 01:49:03.712]  When they get on the main fox, they have the highest ratings.
[01:49:03.712 --> 01:49:09.296]  You can put Lou Dobbs on every night at 9 o'clock, he'd have as much ratings as Sean Hannity.
[01:49:09.296 --> 01:49:13.940]  And he says we're in a civil war where the global is taking over, trying to overthrow the government and go after us.
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.121]  That's what's really happening.
[01:49:15.121 --> 01:49:16.462]  Straight talk from Lou Dobbs.
[01:49:17.626 --> 01:49:18.327]  Real.
[01:49:18.327 --> 01:49:19.108]  Genuine.
[01:49:19.108 --> 01:49:19.829]  Focused.
[01:49:19.829 --> 01:49:20.509]  Heartfelt.
[01:49:20.509 --> 01:49:21.190]  Americana.
[01:49:21.190 --> 01:49:23.152]  Your gut tells you he's good.
[01:49:23.152 --> 01:49:24.994]  The evidence shows you he's good.
[01:49:24.994 --> 01:49:32.683]  You look at a slimebag like Bernstein, he's a parasite who thinks he's better than you because he's been insecure his whole life.
[01:49:32.683 --> 01:49:34.505]  Now, let's go to the next one.
[01:49:34.505 --> 01:49:35.606]  This is the talking point.
[01:49:35.606 --> 01:49:36.207]  Here's another one.
[01:49:37.213 --> 01:49:37.994]  Here's another one of these.
[01:49:37.994 --> 01:49:40.676]  This is MSNBC, the same talking point.
[01:49:40.676 --> 01:49:41.937]  Fox is the enemy.
[01:49:41.937 --> 01:49:43.438]  Fox is Russian now.
[01:49:43.438 --> 01:49:45.219]  See, everyone's a Russian.
[01:49:45.219 --> 01:49:49.883]  Everyone can't be trusted but the globalists who tell you don't be America first.
[01:49:49.883 --> 01:49:51.584]  Don't be America first.
[01:49:51.584 --> 01:49:53.125]  Don't be America first.
[01:49:53.125 --> 01:49:56.868]  No, no, let the globalists run things, but because we're going to protect you from the Russians.
[01:49:56.868 --> 01:49:58.870]  No, you're the outsiders.
[01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:59.971]  You're the enemy.
[01:49:59.971 --> 01:50:01.492]  Here's this idiot from Vanity Fair.
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.222]  Alex is a propaganda network.
[01:50:04.222 --> 01:50:08.566]  It functions off of the idea of breaking people up into teams.
[01:50:08.566 --> 01:50:10.848]  So they are aiding and abetting the enemy.
[01:50:10.848 --> 01:50:17.455]  They are aiding and abetting those people we are currently at war with, the Russians.
[01:50:18.495 --> 01:50:23.476]  In order to play for their team, to make it GOP versus Democrats.
[01:50:23.476 --> 01:50:24.677]  It's not.
[01:50:24.677 --> 01:50:44.481]  It is the United States of America versus people who are a country that is trying to destroy our democracy, break up the Western alliance, and in the process Fox News is saying, don't worry about the Russians, don't worry about the people trying to attack democracy, let's attack instead.
[01:50:44.981 --> 01:50:46.642]  I've got to come back and play that from the beginning.
[01:50:46.642 --> 01:50:47.683]  I mean, this is the new talking point.
[01:50:47.683 --> 01:50:49.684]  We're at war with Russia.
[01:50:49.684 --> 01:50:52.186]  Russian scum!
[01:50:52.186 --> 01:50:53.547]  That's what they're pushing.
[01:50:53.547 --> 01:51:00.352]  A bunch of weird, trendy leftists that want to start a war, hoping they can round up all their opposition, claiming we're foreign agents.
[01:51:00.352 --> 01:51:04.074]  You guys better hope a civil war doesn't start, you chicken necks.
[01:51:04.074 --> 01:51:08.537]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:51:08.537 --> 01:51:10.138]  Those times may be near.
[01:51:10.138 --> 01:51:10.679]  Think about it.
[01:51:11.019 --> 01:51:15.643]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:51:15.643 --> 01:51:20.628]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:20.628 --> 01:51:26.433]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:26.433 --> 01:51:33.159]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:33.159 --> 01:51:35.701]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:51:36.121 --> 01:51:38.923]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:54:29.341 --> 01:54:31.923]  Look at this Drudge Report headline.
[01:54:31.923 --> 01:54:33.344]  OJ set for freedom.
[01:54:35.128 --> 01:54:36.811]  Oh, I'm going to get into that a little bit next hour.
[01:54:36.811 --> 01:54:39.054]  I'm going to go to your phone call, see if we have a guest popping in.
[01:54:39.054 --> 01:54:42.059]  He's running against Pocahontas.
[01:54:42.059 --> 01:54:50.131]  But they just reminded me, I'd forgotten this, that Kirk Eichenwalde of Vanity Fair got caught in a tweet he put out with tentacle porn.
[01:54:51.454 --> 01:54:52.195]  I don't know.
[01:55:08.598 --> 01:55:19.144]  What we see being pushed over in Sweden and things by the whole liberal youth party that wants to legalize basically cartoons of children being raped.
[01:55:19.144 --> 01:55:25.407]  But in the tentacle porn, it's like little women, little children, and then big demons raping them, murdering them.
[01:55:25.407 --> 01:55:27.028]  It's like Satan porn, basically.
[01:55:27.968 --> 01:55:30.851]  Uh, and I don't, I don't subject myself to stuff like that.
[01:55:30.851 --> 01:55:34.033]  I've still never seen the footage of people eating feces.
[01:55:34.033 --> 01:55:36.816]  I've never seen horses having sex with people.
[01:55:36.816 --> 01:55:38.717]  I've, I've, I just refuse to look at it.
[01:55:38.717 --> 01:55:44.902]  But tentacle porn has literally been popping up since I was on MySpace 10 years ago.
[01:55:44.902 --> 01:55:47.945]  But, but just the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the front page stuff.
[01:55:49.266 --> 01:55:52.747]  Of like Xenomorphs from Alien, you know, raping a child.
[01:55:52.747 --> 01:55:57.028]  I mean, it's the most horrible stuff and it's bombarded all over the internet.
[01:55:57.028 --> 01:56:03.710]  And he said, oh, he was having a discussion with his wife and kids, I forgot about this, about whether it was child porn or not.
[01:56:03.710 --> 01:56:06.451]  I mean, now he wants World War III.
[01:56:06.451 --> 01:56:16.634]  He says we're at war with Russia when he goes on MSNBC and that everyone, including Fox News, is part of it as Russian agents.
[01:56:18.554 --> 01:56:21.613]  And why is he like some creepy looking dude?
[01:56:22.748 --> 01:56:24.770]  I mean, it's always the same.
[01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:26.431]  What is going on here?
[01:56:26.431 --> 01:56:32.255]  I mean, I guess you watch demons tearing children apart and, you know, raping them.
[01:56:32.255 --> 01:56:35.398]  I don't know if that's what he watches, but that's what tentacle porn genre is.
[01:56:35.398 --> 01:56:37.840]  Maybe he was just researching it with his children.
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:52.011]  But just so many of these pundits just keep getting caught up in de Blasio's aid and Weiner and, you know, all the sexting and Lolita Express and Epstein and the Pope's deputy getting busted and, you know, all the rest of it.
[01:56:53.044 --> 01:56:58.050]  It just really shows what's going on in these guys' brains, who are really crazed to control this country.
[01:56:58.050 --> 01:57:04.557]  But before I get to the clip of him, here's Maxine Waters saying, the whole Trump family is just a criminal clan.
[01:57:04.557 --> 01:57:11.685]  And then the cover of Time Magazine is, or was it Newsweek, is caught red-handed and they put a Hitler mustache on
[01:57:15.104 --> 01:57:26.158]  Thank you, Leader Pelosi, for organizing all of us today who have taken some action in dealing with Trump.
[01:57:28.965 --> 01:57:31.587]  Family criminal enterprise.
[01:57:31.587 --> 01:57:40.014]  Unveil the criminal activity, the unconstitutional activity of this president and his family.
[01:57:40.014 --> 01:57:41.495]  Think about what Hillary's done.
[01:57:41.495 --> 01:57:44.797]  I have dubbed them the criminal clan.
[01:57:44.797 --> 01:57:47.159]  Alright, let's go out to break with Eichenwalde.
[01:57:47.159 --> 01:57:51.262]  Here's the man that discusses tentacle porn with his children, according to him.
[01:57:51.262 --> 01:57:51.563]  Here he is.
[01:57:53.148 --> 01:57:54.909]  Alex is a propaganda network.
[01:57:54.909 --> 01:57:59.451]  It functions off of the idea of breaking people up into teams.
[01:57:59.451 --> 01:58:01.512]  They are aiding and abetting the enemy.
[01:58:01.512 --> 01:58:07.454]  They are aiding and abetting those people we are currently at war at with.
[01:58:07.454 --> 01:58:08.115]  The Russians.
[01:58:08.955 --> 01:58:11.397]  Uh, in order to play for their team.
[01:58:11.397 --> 01:58:14.159]  Does Zina Morris bite the kids' heads off first or rape them first?
[01:58:14.159 --> 01:58:15.360]  It's not.
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:37.896]  It is the United States of America versus people who are a country that is trying to destroy our democracy, break up the Western alliance, and in the process, Fox News is saying, don't worry about the Russians, don't worry about the people trying to attack democracy, let's attack instead the intelligence agencies giving us these conclusions.
[01:58:38.416 --> 01:58:42.761]  Let's pretend the Democrats are involved, and let's return to tax cuts.
[01:58:42.761 --> 01:58:47.186]  It's obscene, it is propaganda, and it has to stop.
[01:58:47.186 --> 01:58:49.828]  I'm serious, he may have a tentacle-borne spore in his brain.
[01:58:49.828 --> 01:58:50.509]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:58:50.509 --> 01:58:51.030]  We'll be back.
[01:58:54.974 --> 01:58:55.955]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:00:08.066 --> 02:00:16.393]  Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai will be joining us.
[02:00:16.393 --> 02:00:18.514]  He's running against Pocahontas, the fake Indian.
[02:00:18.514 --> 02:00:24.259]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.259 --> 02:00:24.899]  That's coming up.
[02:00:24.899 --> 02:00:27.441]  He'll join us for a few segments and I'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:00:27.441 --> 02:00:31.645]  Right now we got Doug, Joshua, Debbie, Zach, Steven and many, many others.
[02:00:33.049 --> 02:00:36.890]  Let's go to Zach in Florida because he wants to talk about Hillary's pay-to-play.
[02:00:36.890 --> 02:00:39.551]  I'm going to put a report out later this week just showing them.
[02:00:39.551 --> 02:00:44.273]  Hundreds of millions from Saudi Arabia, other countries, the Russians, you name it.
[02:00:44.273 --> 02:00:56.077]  Just showing where she's caught red-handed taking money for policy, but then Trump's son meeting with some Russians about dirt on her is the end of the world and we're at war with Russia.
[02:00:57.898 --> 02:01:06.303]  So, Mr. Ayadurai will be joining us coming up, the real Indian, running against Pocahontas, coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:06.303 --> 02:01:09.084]  But right now, let's go to Zach in Florida.
[02:01:09.084 --> 02:01:09.865]  Zach, you're on the air.
[02:01:11.269 --> 02:01:12.449]  Yes Alex, how you doing?
[02:01:12.449 --> 02:01:23.392]  It's great to be back on and I wanted to just update a little tidbit when it comes to this pay-to-play which is really just this premeditated predatory behavior that's been going on since the 90s.
[02:01:23.392 --> 02:01:30.994]  What I think is a major key here is if we could get Louis Farrakhan into the equation because Louis Farrakhan has been dealing with the Clintons since the 90s.
[02:01:30.994 --> 02:01:31.694]  You could pull up the
[02:01:32.524 --> 02:01:33.344]  Sure, sure.
[02:01:33.344 --> 02:01:49.328]  You can say what you want about Farrakhan, who I've met with and had dinner with and all the rest of it.
[02:01:49.328 --> 02:01:52.668]  He's right about getting people off welfare, getting your own community things.
[02:01:52.668 --> 02:01:57.689]  And he's been quasi for Trump and then not for Trump because his constituency wouldn't go for it.
[02:01:57.689 --> 02:01:58.890]  But you're right.
[02:01:58.890 --> 02:01:59.990]  Farrakhan hates the Clintons.
[02:02:01.588 --> 02:02:07.232]  So in 96, they block his $1 billion loan, and they run through the White House and they do this type of thing.
[02:02:07.232 --> 02:02:14.836]  Later on during the Obama administration, he gets another loan, but of course Hillary Clinton wasn't, you know, it wasn't her foundation getting the money, so she wasn't going to do this along with her plan.
[02:02:14.836 --> 02:02:17.378]  For folks that don't know, I'm going to do a whole report this week.
[02:02:17.918 --> 02:02:25.783]  That just details, I mean, the Clintons have gotten more than 15 billion dollars from foreign governments in the last 15 years.
[02:02:25.783 --> 02:02:29.886]  It's over a billion a year and almost all of it is illegal.
[02:02:29.886 --> 02:02:33.669]  I mean, hell, Trudeau in Canada is giving massive money to them.
[02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:34.349]  This is ridiculous.
[02:02:34.349 --> 02:02:38.952]  But again, they get everybody involved in the crime so that it's too big to prosecute.
[02:02:38.952 --> 02:02:39.913]  You see, they do that on purpose.
[02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:44.569]  So could you imagine, Hillary Clinton's involved in blocking money coming to the U.S.
[02:02:44.569 --> 02:02:58.897]  to create local jobs, but yet she'll take money from a foreign government in order to, you know... Just like they gave 97 million dollars, we covered it yesterday, to the phosphate operations overseas, and then they gave her money in turn.
[02:02:58.897 --> 02:03:01.079]  So she pays to ship the jobs overseas.
[02:03:02.168 --> 02:03:07.470]  And it just shows how brainwashed the left is, because this is supposed to be a pro-minority group.
[02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:09.791]  Ladies and gentlemen, she does not care about minorities.
[02:03:09.791 --> 02:03:11.152]  She is a predator.
[02:03:11.152 --> 02:03:15.653]  This money that was blocked from Libya was going to the African-American community, okay?
[02:03:15.653 --> 02:03:18.314]  So where's the uproar from Black Lives Matter?
[02:03:18.314 --> 02:03:21.536]  Five billion, you know, organic, quote-unquote, dollars coming into the economy?
[02:03:21.536 --> 02:03:22.416]  No, that's blocked.
[02:03:22.416 --> 02:03:24.837]  But, you know, she could do no wrong on the left eye.
[02:03:24.837 --> 02:03:27.578]  So this just proves that this is a surface-level
[02:03:28.158 --> 02:03:30.518]  Well, we have them in the WikiLeaks.
[02:03:30.518 --> 02:03:33.419]  We have them in the WikiLeaks saying, we can't let people get self-sufficient.
[02:03:33.419 --> 02:03:37.220]  We've got to keep them poor, desperate, and in the dark.
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:43.001]  During the election, you have a clip from Louis Farrakhan, after she, make no mistake, she has blood on her hands.
[02:03:43.001 --> 02:03:53.623]  She's guilty of the murder of Mubarak Gaddafi, whether you look at it from a sovereign country's perspective, or if you look at it for the debacle of our troops in Benghazi, or our ambassador in Benghazi.
[02:03:53.623 --> 02:03:54.783]  Let me make this clear.
[02:03:54.783 --> 02:03:56.123]  The blood is on her hands,
[02:03:56.778 --> 02:04:02.103]  Billions of dollars were traded hands here, and someone's dead.
[02:04:02.103 --> 02:04:03.083]  And look at her track record.
[02:04:03.083 --> 02:04:05.766]  Everywhere you go, she's surrounded by these crazy stories.
[02:04:05.766 --> 02:04:13.012]  And Louis Farrakhan has a clip where he calls her a wicked woman during the campaign against Trump.
[02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:14.473]  And pretty much sides with Trump.
[02:04:14.473 --> 02:04:19.857]  Tells his congregation to look into Hillary's dealings, and look into what she did to quote-unquote, my family.
[02:04:19.857 --> 02:04:20.638]  No, I know.
[02:04:20.638 --> 02:04:22.560]  I mean, in person, Louis Farrakhan was pro-Trump.
[02:04:23.416 --> 02:04:27.177]  And then when he had pro-Trump statements, no media would pick it up.
[02:04:27.177 --> 02:04:31.859]  And I've since been invited back to go, and it's not that I don't want to go interview Faircon again, it's a big interview.
[02:04:31.859 --> 02:04:37.380]  I've just been so slammed, I haven't been traveling much the last year, but I'm probably going to get another interview with him soon.
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:42.182]  Because they want to do it in person, so it's just hard for me to travel with some of the stuff that's been going on.
[02:04:42.182 --> 02:04:44.882]  As people see, I've had The Globalist after me 24-7.
[02:04:46.923 --> 02:04:51.025]  So I have been kind of hiding out in the rear with the gear.
[02:04:51.025 --> 02:04:52.026]  Thank you, Zach.
[02:04:52.026 --> 02:04:54.527]  We'll be back with Doug, Joshua, Debbie and others.
[02:04:54.527 --> 02:05:00.090]  But first, the real end then, who's running against Pocahontas in the Senate and rising in the polls.
[02:05:00.090 --> 02:05:01.011]  We'll talk to Dr. Shiva.
[02:05:04.474 --> 02:05:10.536]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[02:05:10.536 --> 02:05:12.037]  The contest is simple.
[02:05:12.037 --> 02:05:17.298]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[02:05:17.298 --> 02:05:24.681]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[02:05:24.841 --> 02:05:31.505]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:31.505 --> 02:05:41.571]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[02:05:41.571 --> 02:05:49.115]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[02:05:49.315 --> 02:05:59.412]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.

[02:06:16.032 --> 02:06:16.932]  Big waiting list.
[02:06:16.932 --> 02:06:20.776]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[02:06:20.776 --> 02:06:21.837]  Nobody's got something as good.

[02:06:45.212 --> 02:06:51.075]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[02:06:51.075 --> 02:06:51.716]  Now it's epidemic.

[02:08:38.513 --> 02:08:39.774]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:08:39.774 --> 02:08:52.060]  We're now well into the third hour, and here's a little snip of our guest that's coming up, breaking down exactly why he's running against the fraud that is Elizabeth Warren, a.k.a.
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:54.341]  Pocahontas.
[02:08:54.341 --> 02:08:55.442]  Sensation, yeah.
[02:08:55.442 --> 02:09:01.045]  If you do the same and beat Elizabeth Warren, Senator Warren, that would be a double sensation.
[02:09:01.045 --> 02:09:02.005]  Well, I think only a really
[02:09:06.199 --> 02:09:11.643]  I sent her a DNA test kit for her birthday, and I was very sad that she returned it.
[02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:13.966]  And I tweeted it out, and it went viral all over the internet.
[02:09:13.966 --> 02:09:22.814]  Because see, the issue of real Indian and fake Indian, there's a truth there, because here's a woman who actually checked off the box saying that she's a Native American.
[02:09:22.814 --> 02:09:30.981]  I mean, this foretells a person who's basically a self-serving elitist, is willing to cut in line as she needs, is willing to promote policies
[02:09:32.329 --> 02:09:32.409]  Yes.
[02:09:43.362 --> 02:09:49.928]  By the way, folks, I knew who our guest was when I had him on a few months ago, whenever Owen Schroer recommended we have him on.
[02:09:49.928 --> 02:09:51.250]  I mean, I knew who he was.
[02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:56.855]  I knew he created companies that have produced hundreds of millions of dollars and hired thousands of people.
[02:09:56.855 --> 02:10:03.201]  I knew that they had stuff kind of like email, but he was the first guy to actually package it and name it that when he was in college, or I guess high school.
[02:10:03.201 --> 02:10:06.144]  I mean, he really is a great entrepreneur.
[02:10:06.144 --> 02:10:07.405]  The example of what we want
[02:10:08.388 --> 02:10:20.993]  In Congress, in the presidency, in the state houses, that actually understands where the power comes from the people, from working hard, from ideas, from the human mind, not from the elite establishment.
[02:10:20.993 --> 02:10:26.656]  And we've got Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai on with us at the bottom of the hour, then I'll go right back to your phone calls.
[02:10:26.656 --> 02:10:28.977]  And I've seen the polls, he is racing up against her.
[02:10:29.637 --> 02:10:32.140]  He's starting to raise a lot of small donations.
[02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:33.541]  He's getting on Fox News, you name it.
[02:10:33.541 --> 02:10:34.963]  They're starting to demonize him.
[02:10:34.963 --> 02:10:37.485]  They're really, really scared of him.
[02:10:37.485 --> 02:10:45.013]  And the website is shiva4senate.com So since you were on a month, month and a half ago, a lot has happened.
[02:10:45.013 --> 02:10:46.295]  You've gotten a lot of traction.
[02:10:46.815 --> 02:10:48.496]  Very, very exciting.
[02:10:48.496 --> 02:10:58.041]  Tell us where the battlefield is right now, because it shows we've got to get more good people in Congress, more good people in the House and Senate, because we've got the Democrats and Republican establishment blocking Trump.
[02:10:58.041 --> 02:11:00.362]  We've got the Freedom Caucus doing a great job.
[02:11:00.362 --> 02:11:02.944]  We've got him, via executive power, delivering.
[02:11:02.944 --> 02:11:07.927]  But, you know, we've got to help Trump, and I know you're wanting to get in there to help make America great again.
[02:11:07.927 --> 02:11:13.650]  So, since we last talked, where is Elizabeth Warren, aka Pocahontas, in our sights?
[02:11:14.838 --> 02:11:17.079]  Thanks Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:11:17.079 --> 02:11:30.547]  Elizabeth Warren is running for her life in many ways, and the way that it's manifesting itself is that the local media, Alex, the Boston Globe, the Herald, WRKO, even a guy called Howie Carr, and I'll come back to this,
[02:11:31.087 --> 02:11:43.579]  There's a new fake Trump movement which has aligned itself with the RINOs as well as the Democrats are essentially running scared and they don't even mention me or very little mention in the local press.
[02:11:43.579 --> 02:11:47.723]  So now that they can't beat us, they're now going to try to run as us.
[02:11:48.678 --> 02:11:49.879]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:11:49.879 --> 02:12:03.450]  So, you know, as I mentioned, I think you mentioned, I have a degree in biological engineering, a PhD from MIT, and what's been fascinating over the last 100 days is I've had to put on my biology hat to understand the biology of the swamp creatures in Massachusetts.
[02:12:03.450 --> 02:12:05.051]  And that biology is fascinating.
[02:12:05.051 --> 02:12:09.395]  What it's revealing is, as you said, is, you know, we had the establishment swamp creatures
[02:12:09.795 --> 02:12:12.136]  And I've seen the photos, there's fake photos of him with Trump, shaking hands, everything.
[02:12:36.463 --> 02:12:45.552]  Exactly, and in fact what I did was I literally had one of the leading forensic guys in the world do an analysis of that photo and it's a complete fake.
[02:12:45.552 --> 02:12:47.134]  This guy is literally photoshopped.
[02:12:47.134 --> 02:12:51.037]  I think I may send him the book called Photoshop for Idiots or Photoshop for Dummies.
[02:12:51.037 --> 02:12:53.540]  Probably the former because I don't think he's ready for the dummies one yet.
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:58.384]  And he's literally photoshopped a picture and Trump really has three hands in this picture.
[02:12:58.384 --> 02:13:00.846]  But that's what you have going on.
[02:13:00.846 --> 02:13:08.432]  And what's fascinating is that the rhino Democrat media complex within Massachusetts is trying to keep me out.
[02:13:08.432 --> 02:13:15.017]  But they have a problem because we got on Fox, we tweet, you know, we get out there with, you know, great media like you guys who tell the truth.
[02:13:15.017 --> 02:13:18.840]  So, so I think we're in a literally a bold new American revolution.
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:21.643]  And every day Donald Trump stays in office, we win.
[02:13:21.983 --> 02:13:26.427]  We cannot measure Donald Trump's success based on which bill gets passed or not.
[02:13:26.427 --> 02:13:35.334]  What we can measure it on is the fact that people like me, people like Kid Rock, people like Omar Navarro, we're coming out and this movement is explosively growing.
[02:13:35.334 --> 02:13:39.217]  And more importantly, we're able to expose these fake Trumpers.
[02:13:39.217 --> 02:13:40.318]  And I think that's the next
[02:13:40.438 --> 02:13:40.939]  That's right.
[02:13:40.939 --> 02:13:42.481]  You're there to be part of the debates.
[02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:43.282]  Win, lose, or draw.
[02:13:43.282 --> 02:13:45.085]  You win by participating.
[02:13:45.085 --> 02:13:46.387]  And then we're there exposing them.
[02:13:46.387 --> 02:13:51.094]  We're there building a populist libertarian movement to take over the Republicans.
[02:13:51.094 --> 02:13:53.197]  And we're so close to winning.
[02:13:53.197 --> 02:13:55.761]  Ron Paul and myself and others created the original Tea Party.
[02:13:56.201 --> 02:13:56.542]  Exactly.
[02:14:10.998 --> 02:14:19.206]  There's a real resurgence of Americana and an attempt to have a big tent, bring everybody in around free market, around prosperity.
[02:14:19.206 --> 02:14:21.167]  They're totally panicking and exactly.
[02:14:21.167 --> 02:14:22.869]  He's done a great job executively.
[02:14:22.869 --> 02:14:24.711]  They're trying to block him to kill his agenda.
[02:14:24.711 --> 02:14:25.792]  They're trying to kill the economy.
[02:14:25.792 --> 02:14:28.274]  They're trying to raise interest rates, showing how scared they are.
[02:14:28.274 --> 02:14:34.960]  But despite that, people in major polls blame the Republican and Democrat establishment for blocking Trump.
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:35.861]  And so exactly.
[02:14:36.181 --> 02:14:38.983]  Every day he's in there, defeats them with their political correctness.
[02:14:38.983 --> 02:14:42.145]  He gets better Supreme Court justices, better federal judges.
[02:14:42.145 --> 02:14:45.468]  I've got AP Reuters, InfoWars.com.
[02:14:45.468 --> 02:14:51.152]  Border Patrol Union Chief praises miraculous drop in illegal immigration under Trump.
[02:14:51.152 --> 02:14:53.113]  63% now, it was 40-something percent.
[02:14:53.113 --> 02:14:55.475]  We've got Border Patrol energized like never before.
[02:14:55.475 --> 02:14:57.697]  InfoWars.com, says Union President.
[02:14:58.237 --> 02:14:59.798]  It's not evil to have a border.
[02:14:59.798 --> 02:15:01.079]  Mexico has a border.
[02:15:01.079 --> 02:15:02.741]  China has a border.
[02:15:02.741 --> 02:15:03.661]  Russia has a border.
[02:15:03.661 --> 02:15:04.642]  India has a border.
[02:15:04.642 --> 02:15:05.803]  South Africa has a border.
[02:15:05.803 --> 02:15:10.267]  This is globalism conquering us, saying we can't say America first.
[02:15:10.267 --> 02:15:14.250]  Well, if we don't have a country that's for its people, what are we paying taxes for, Shiva?
[02:15:14.975 --> 02:15:20.500]  Exactly, and the reality is Hollywood elites when I was out there have, you know, amazing borders around their home.
[02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:23.663]  You know, so, and these are the same people trying to tell us we should not have borders.
[02:15:23.663 --> 02:15:26.545]  You know, I came here, as I mentioned in that Fox News interview, legally.
[02:15:26.545 --> 02:15:27.826]  I had to wait a year.
[02:15:27.826 --> 02:15:29.408]  My dad came here first.
[02:15:29.408 --> 02:15:31.730]  And self-serving elites like Elizabeth Warren
[02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:38.393]  Who cut in line, you know, checked off that box, as I mentioned, saying that she was a Native American to get into Harvard.
[02:15:38.393 --> 02:15:43.736]  These are the same people who promote these self-serving, elitist policies, saying that we should not have a border.
[02:15:43.736 --> 02:15:48.078]  By the way, Alex, I mentioned, you know, I sent Elizabeth Warren a DNA test kit.
[02:15:48.078 --> 02:15:49.379]  She refused it.
[02:15:49.379 --> 02:15:51.460]  We took it on the internet, went viral.
[02:15:51.460 --> 02:15:54.141]  I actually had my 23andMe DNA test done.
[02:15:54.141 --> 02:15:59.064]  It turns out I'm actually a lot of dot, but I also have a little Native American in me.
[02:15:59.264 --> 02:16:01.145]  It's a little bit, but I got some in me.
[02:16:01.145 --> 02:16:04.426]  So I'm a lot of dot and a little feather, as I like to say.
[02:16:04.426 --> 02:16:08.107]  So you got a real, real Indian running against the fake Indian.
[02:16:08.107 --> 02:16:11.068]  But I think we cannot forget what you've just brought up.
[02:16:11.068 --> 02:16:23.753]  You know, we had the Trump revolution, the Trump movement needs to expand, and that expansion is being forced all by, as you said, I think we both mentioned it, the Civil War, and that Civil War now is being led by what I call fake
[02:16:24.133 --> 02:16:39.140]  Trumpers on the front end that the rhinos and the Dems are using and in Massachusetts we have this dirty deal guy who's out there so we are gonna expose him, destroy him because it's part of getting out the true narrative of what it means to be an American.
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:45.663]  As you mentioned we need people who are creators, we need people who are soldiers, we need people who are inventors, innovators.
[02:16:45.663 --> 02:16:47.803]  That's what the founders of this country wanted.
[02:16:47.803 --> 02:16:51.065]  They did not want swamp creature career politicians or dirty deals.
[02:16:51.505 --> 02:17:02.450]  And that's what I'm here for, and I love this country, Alex, and I'm so happy that this movement is growing, and every day it's growing, and I think it's a fantastic opportunity for all of America to see this grow.
[02:17:02.450 --> 02:17:09.453]  And we need to get everyone participating, everyone to support this president, because he's fighting a major war against the deep state.
[02:17:09.453 --> 02:17:14.735]  In Massachusetts, we have a microcosm of that deep state, but I would also argue the belly of the beast of the swamp.
[02:17:15.115 --> 02:17:20.761]  Because you have the elites here, you have the self-serving elites who come up with all the narratives that goes out in the media.
[02:17:20.761 --> 02:17:29.630]  You have a permanent corporate and governmental bureaucracy, a bunch of boss hogs, whether you're in Massachusetts or Texas or anywhere, you get these entitled boss hogs.
[02:17:30.171 --> 02:17:39.160]  That's why in Texas, one town will be free, open, happy, taxes go to the real things, and then you drive into another one, you can feel it going across the county line.
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:41.682]  The cops act different, the people look upset.
[02:17:41.682 --> 02:17:44.785]  I mean, it's like North Korea versus the United States.
[02:17:44.785 --> 02:17:50.131]  Political policy is everything when it comes to the culture of the people, and we want to get back to America.
[02:17:50.131 --> 02:17:54.315]  I don't get why the left pushes they want collectivism when all it creates is abject nightmares.
[02:17:55.216 --> 02:18:04.459]  Yeah, I mean, in Massachusetts, one of the interesting conditions, and this is reflected in the national level, is for every 17 skilled job openings, only one person is skilled.
[02:18:04.459 --> 02:18:07.840]  Yes, we need to keep lower taxes, any dummy can tell you that.
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:12.922]  But the reality is, the establishment Democrats and Republicans have not produced enough skilled jobs.
[02:18:12.922 --> 02:18:17.504]  What they have created is, and Massachusetts is a mecca of this, the educational industrial complex.
[02:18:18.004 --> 02:18:20.066]  Every parent sends their kids to colleges.
[02:18:20.066 --> 02:18:23.048]  They end up with 50, 60, $100,000 loans.
[02:18:23.048 --> 02:18:25.269]  And those student loans don't even go to the students.
[02:18:25.269 --> 02:18:32.795]  They go right from the government to these large universities where people like Elizabeth Warren can get paid $350,000 for teaching one course.
[02:18:32.795 --> 02:18:34.036]  Students are coming out.
[02:18:34.036 --> 02:18:34.836]  They can't read.
[02:18:34.836 --> 02:18:39.319]  I'm glad you mentioned this because you've got a huge education and started all these companies.
[02:18:39.319 --> 02:18:44.723]  And I'm not going to go over all the stuff you've done at MIT and everywhere else because it would take 20 minutes and all the things you've invented.
[02:18:44.723 --> 02:18:46.364]  But they think I'm bashing
[02:18:47.245 --> 02:18:53.352]  No, they turned it into brainwashing, they engineered it for an economy that doesn't exist anymore, and as you know most degrees are worthless now.
[02:19:07.648 --> 02:19:14.995]  I'm saying we should have education designed for our high-tech world, and then these leftists get saddled with these fake educations.
[02:19:14.995 --> 02:19:20.020]  They want a desperate liberal world that will exist with their education.
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:21.801]  Sorry, they got conned.
[02:19:21.801 --> 02:19:23.583]  And that's the big issue.
[02:19:23.583 --> 02:19:25.465]  They've got to admit, they got conned.
[02:19:26.428 --> 02:19:27.669]  Yeah, they got completely conned.
[02:19:27.669 --> 02:19:35.117]  You know, I was fortunate, Alex, because I've been working as we've shared since I was 14 when I built that first email system.
[02:19:35.117 --> 02:19:41.843]  I went to MIT and I figured out at MIT after a couple of years that a lot of the professors there were not as smart as they were projecting.
[02:19:41.843 --> 02:19:45.607]  So I kept one foot in, but I was always working full-time, Alex.
[02:19:45.607 --> 02:19:47.129]  So I was able to take what I needed
[02:19:47.569 --> 02:19:53.813]  But I was also able to get those degrees so I can use them as weapons one day because now they can't say that I'm a nobody.
[02:19:53.813 --> 02:19:59.617]  So I did this in a very strategic way, but I have always been working and that's what creates America.
[02:19:59.617 --> 02:20:01.057]  It's people who work every day.
[02:20:01.057 --> 02:20:02.198]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:20:02.198 --> 02:20:04.640]  I was going to college and I was already successful.
[02:20:05.356 --> 02:20:06.417]  is on the rise.
[02:20:06.417 --> 02:20:11.742]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:20:11.742 --> 02:20:13.324]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:13.324 --> 02:20:21.671]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:21.671 --> 02:20:27.377]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:20:27.537 --> 02:20:29.359]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:20:29.359 --> 02:20:31.641]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:20:31.641 --> 02:20:36.025]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:20:36.025 --> 02:20:38.227]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:20:38.227 --> 02:20:46.034]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:21:03.846 --> 02:21:06.870]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:11.035]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:21:11.035 --> 02:21:17.703]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:21:17.703 --> 02:21:21.447]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[02:21:22.148 --> 02:21:41.560]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:46.182]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:21:46.182 --> 02:21:57.369]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:21:57.369 --> 02:22:02.452]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[02:22:03.052 --> 02:22:07.514]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[02:22:07.514 --> 02:22:09.095]  Those times may be near.
[02:22:09.095 --> 02:22:09.995]  Think about it.
[02:22:09.995 --> 02:22:14.598]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:22:14.598 --> 02:22:19.240]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:25.384]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:22:25.384 --> 02:22:32.109]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[02:22:32.109 --> 02:22:34.651]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[02:22:35.091 --> 02:22:37.892]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[02:23:22.156 --> 02:23:23.577]  Or warm and served.

[02:23:33.245 --> 02:23:35.606]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:23:35.606 --> 02:23:43.651]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[02:24:09.537 --> 02:24:15.280]  Dr. Shiva Inure is running against Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts.
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:16.500]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:18.401]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:24:18.401 --> 02:24:24.725]  Starting in the next segment, I'll go directly to your phone calls and a lot of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:24:24.725 --> 02:24:25.485]  But first off...
[02:24:27.222 --> 02:24:33.705]  Forty people shot over the weekend in Chicago with some of the most draconian gun laws in the nation.
[02:24:33.705 --> 02:24:42.110]  Why is it that everywhere Democrats are in control of a city, they have epidemic crime, poverty, and collapse?
[02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:45.351]  It's because they're an organized crime system.
[02:24:45.351 --> 02:24:48.033]  And the Republicans are part of that criminal system at the top.
[02:24:49.448 --> 02:25:01.437]  But we're coming to the end of the line here where the left says we're in an existential civil war and that Fox News, myself, anybody that wants prosperity or America First is a Russian agent.
[02:25:01.437 --> 02:25:14.147]  Let me see, I'm a Russian agent because I want Trump to turn our coal and oil back on that lowered the prices of exports for Russia and hurt them worse than Obama could have ever done with sanctions.
[02:25:14.147 --> 02:25:15.368]  I don't want to hurt Russia!
[02:25:15.368 --> 02:25:16.529]  Sorry, America First!
[02:25:18.211 --> 02:25:20.916]  Again, none of it is reality-based.
[02:25:20.916 --> 02:25:26.425]  So, Dr. Shiva, why are Democratic Party areas such hellholes?
[02:25:28.285 --> 02:25:39.049]  Bottom line, the entire philosophy of the Democratic Party and obviously their establishment counterparts in the Republican Party is to create a party or a situation of dependency, Alex.
[02:25:39.049 --> 02:25:46.092]  It's not about what the founders had, that there was supposed to be a direct connection between us and our creator without any intermediaries.
[02:25:46.092 --> 02:25:51.414]  These people want to create dependencies like, you know, they want to create the opioid epidemic.
[02:25:51.414 --> 02:25:52.855]  That's what they want.
[02:25:52.855 --> 02:25:53.955]  Oh, let's talk about that.
[02:25:53.955 --> 02:25:54.936]  You're a really smart cookie.
[02:25:55.496 --> 02:26:05.274]  Why have they increased multi-hundred times the amount of opiates dumped out, and the very same government that allowed it acts like it's the savior and comes out with stronger drugs to counter the other drugs?
[02:26:05.274 --> 02:26:08.039]  That's like getting rid of opium with heroin at the end of the Civil War.
[02:26:08.874 --> 02:26:17.302]  Yeah, I mean, if you actually look at this whole concept of the opioid model, you remember, if you ever went to your doctor, they'd ask you, what was your level of pain?
[02:26:17.302 --> 02:26:20.204]  Remember, they used to have a scale level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[02:26:20.204 --> 02:26:24.868]  Well, they had something for the low end of it, you know, like Advil, whatever, Tylenol.
[02:26:24.868 --> 02:26:27.210]  And they had stuff for the high end, like morphine.
[02:26:27.210 --> 02:26:29.713]  And then they created a middle end because there was no drug there.
[02:26:29.713 --> 02:26:31.034]  They saw market opportunity.
[02:26:31.034 --> 02:26:32.055]  So a bunch of academics
[02:26:32.935 --> 02:26:38.936]  Some of the academic institutions created that and that was their way that they started getting people addicted.
[02:26:38.936 --> 02:26:42.177]  That was the first model because it essentially created a market opportunity.
[02:26:42.177 --> 02:26:53.340]  The entire opioid epidemic is a result of a pharma-industrial complex process that they put through and now we have all this opioid epidemic taking place.
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:54.760]  The interesting thing Alex is
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:57.320]  There are solutions to the opioid epidemic.
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:05.942]  We found, we came across an amazing doctor who actually was able to detox people in the home and he was shut down by the local Democrat Attorney General here.
[02:27:05.942 --> 02:27:07.503]  It's a very interesting story.
[02:27:07.503 --> 02:27:09.523]  It's a movie coming out called Hero in America.
[02:27:09.523 --> 02:27:12.864]  Please come on the Nightly News with the director and tell us about that.
[02:27:12.864 --> 02:27:18.305]  I mean, what's incredible is they demonize us for selling organic shampoo.
[02:27:18.305 --> 02:27:22.066]  They now call shampoo and toothpaste that I sell, and coffee, snake oil.
[02:27:22.446 --> 02:27:24.008]  They say, I claim my coffee's good.
[02:27:24.008 --> 02:27:26.411]  I mean, this is now next level.
[02:27:26.411 --> 02:27:32.918]  They claim that when I sell selenium or things, that it's a con game, even though you gotta have selenium to live and all the cancer studies.
[02:27:32.918 --> 02:27:38.425]  But then, exactly half their ads are for opiates and stuff that'll kill you.
[02:27:38.425 --> 02:27:39.826]  Mainstream media is a joke.
[02:27:40.714 --> 02:27:48.896]  Yeah, I mean, starting around the 70s, you had the pharmaceutical companies and the health insurance companies start to dictate health policy in America.
[02:27:48.896 --> 02:28:03.100]  And if you look at from the 70s all the way to, you know, 2000, when RomneyCare, same as Obamacare, was implemented, what we now have is we have the health insurance industrial complex and the pharmaceutical industrial complex.
[02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:05.021]  And that's why they're going from surgery to pills!
[02:28:05.561 --> 02:28:05.901]  Exactly.
[02:28:05.901 --> 02:28:09.542]  Now they say, sorry, we're not going to fix your back with surgery, we're going to give you a bunch of pills.
[02:28:09.542 --> 02:28:09.942]  Exactly.
[02:28:09.942 --> 02:28:11.903]  So it's knives and drugs medicine.
[02:28:11.903 --> 02:28:15.544]  It's wartime medicine after you get screwed up and they want you to get screwed up.
[02:28:15.544 --> 02:28:16.904]  It's not about prevention.
[02:28:16.904 --> 02:28:18.785]  I mean, a lot of the stuff I think you're into... Oh, I know.
[02:28:18.785 --> 02:28:22.206]  Everybody I know goes to the doctor over nothing and they're pushing opiates on them.
[02:28:22.833 --> 02:28:30.599]  Yeah, and if you look at the actual model, when you look at the health care model, you go to your doctor, what, in the 70s you paid, what, 15-20 bucks, you got a scratch?
[02:28:30.599 --> 02:28:31.300]  That's what it was.
[02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:36.224]  Now we pay 15-20 bucks as a co-pay, on top of it we're paying all this insurance.
[02:28:36.224 --> 02:28:41.168]  The health insurance companies are essentially dictating medical policy right now.
[02:28:41.168 --> 02:28:51.797]  You've had the wiping out of the local family doctor, your local healer, which was, every village was supposed to have a local healer like my grandmother was, and they've all had to join this corporatized medicine.
[02:28:51.817 --> 02:29:03.844]  We've got to get you in the Senate because it's the big corporations, the big insurance companies and banks that wrote Obamacare bipartisanly to rip everybody off, to make you buy it, to put big insurance companies in control of medicine.
[02:29:03.844 --> 02:29:04.604]  And you're right.
[02:29:04.604 --> 02:29:16.011]  Big Pharma is now our doctor, and infant mortality is going up, our life expectancy is dropping, and flesh-eating bacteria is spreading, and the opioids are everywhere.
[02:29:16.011 --> 02:29:17.012]  They are killing us.
[02:29:17.967 --> 02:29:23.671]  Yeah, and the bottom line is the immune system of the average person is getting destroyed year over year over year.
[02:29:23.671 --> 02:29:30.055]  And fundamentally, the immune system is what you need, uh, necessary to prevent us from cancer and all these diseases.
[02:29:30.055 --> 02:29:31.896]  Listen, Dr. Shiva, you're amazing.
[02:29:31.896 --> 02:29:34.477]  But regardless, let's start talking soon.
[02:29:34.477 --> 02:29:36.579]  I'm about to launch a bunch of new shows.
[02:29:36.579 --> 02:29:39.961]  I would like to seriously have you be part of InfoWars because you're so knowledgeable.
[02:29:41.204 --> 02:29:42.485]  Alright, well thank you so much, sir.
[02:29:42.485 --> 02:29:43.406]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:43.406 --> 02:29:44.427]  Thank you so much.
[02:29:44.427 --> 02:29:44.727]  Thank you.
[02:29:44.727 --> 02:29:46.229]  Shiba4Senate.com.
[02:29:46.229 --> 02:29:46.929]  Wow, amazing.
[02:29:46.929 --> 02:29:51.033]  That's Dr. Shiva Idore running for Senate against Pocahontas.
[02:29:51.033 --> 02:29:53.356]  Be sure to get behind him.
[02:29:53.356 --> 02:29:54.757]  We're on the march.
[02:29:54.757 --> 02:29:57.279]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:57.279 --> 02:29:59.962]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.506 --> 02:30:08.570]  We must keep the Internet free from communistic government restrictions and parameters.
[02:30:08.570 --> 02:30:09.190]  Why?
[02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:11.632]  Because it would stop memes and erase heroes.
[02:30:11.632 --> 02:30:12.533]  Don't believe me?
[02:30:12.533 --> 02:30:13.474]  Look at China.
[02:30:13.474 --> 02:30:21.301]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously memed with Barack Obama in 2013, when a picture of the two was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, too.
[02:30:21.301 --> 02:30:27.626]  This happened again after an awkward handshake with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Eeyore.
[02:30:27.626 --> 02:30:31.990]  Other images, such as Winnie the Pooh in a car, have been memed alongside President Xi in his limo.
[02:30:32.290 --> 02:30:37.471]  But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular, China has now censored it from the Internet.
[02:30:37.471 --> 02:30:39.272]  This is commonplace in Communist China.
[02:30:39.272 --> 02:30:46.813]  As a recently deceased political dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo has had his name completely censored from the virtual world.
[02:30:46.813 --> 02:30:51.254]  Try sending his name in a message to a friend, and the message will disappear into cyberspace.
[02:30:51.254 --> 02:30:55.415]  Xiaobo died in Chinese custody, and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[02:30:55.415 --> 02:30:56.976]  Keep the Internet free in America.
[02:30:56.976 --> 02:30:58.196]  Stop net neutrality.
[02:30:58.196 --> 02:30:59.536]  Save meme magic.
[02:30:59.536 --> 02:31:01.677]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroeder.
[02:31:04.164 --> 02:31:06.045]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:06.045 --> 02:31:08.066]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:08.066 --> 02:31:10.968]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:10.968 --> 02:31:17.032]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:17.032 --> 02:31:23.276]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems.
[02:31:23.536 --> 02:31:26.219]  ...have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:31:26.219 --> 02:31:33.765]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:33.765 --> 02:31:41.793]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:41.793 --> 02:31:42.754]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:43.972 --> 02:31:47.895]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:47.895 --> 02:31:51.477]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:51.477 --> 02:31:58.182]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:58.182 --> 02:32:02.285]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[02:32:04.258 --> 02:32:09.662]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:32:09.662 --> 02:32:12.504]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:32:12.504 --> 02:32:14.505]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:32:14.505 --> 02:32:19.528]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:32:19.528 --> 02:32:21.610]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:22.910]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:28.014]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:28.014 --> 02:32:31.376]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:32:31.536 --> 02:32:34.897]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:32:34.897 --> 02:32:37.878]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:32:37.878 --> 02:32:41.579]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:41.579 --> 02:32:48.481]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:48.481 --> 02:32:55.983]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[02:33:07.226 --> 02:33:10.107]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:33:10.107 --> 02:33:17.628]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:33:17.628 --> 02:33:25.250]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:28.411]  Alright, I'm going right to your phone calls this second.
[02:33:29.494 --> 02:33:46.166]  And then, Trevor Noah has put a new demonization piece out against us, and I thought I'd play it, not just because it's about us, Comedy Central, but because it illustrates how pathetic these people are, and how they've got to talk about us to try to keep any viewers.
[02:33:46.166 --> 02:33:52.451]  I mean, because for a month they've been attacking myself and Gwyneth Paltrow, because she sells supplements and I sell supplements.
[02:33:52.451 --> 02:33:55.994]  They never point out that Jeff Bezos is the biggest supplement seller in the world with Whole Foods.
[02:33:57.756 --> 02:34:07.265]  And they never point out that, again, D Magazine and others that first started this, they show that I sell coffee and they call it snake oils.
[02:34:07.265 --> 02:34:10.769]  I didn't, and again, they're attacking us selling shampoo now.
[02:34:10.769 --> 02:34:21.640]  I'm not allowed to sell fluoride-free toothpaste that's made by the same manufacturer as Tom's of Maine with iodine and colloidal silver, even though they have known antibacterial health benefits.
[02:34:24.022 --> 02:34:25.262]  But see, I am allowed.
[02:34:25.262 --> 02:34:29.483]  They're not God, and people know the value, despite what they say and do.
[02:34:29.483 --> 02:34:47.008]  So, we have the new mechanical toothbrush that has embedded coital silver in it, mouthwashers, 3D action flossing bristle, put up by the same folks that have the little disposable ones that we sell that have coital silver in them, and we have that discounted when you get it with our super blue fluoride-free
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:49.801]  Toothpaste that is now back in stock.
[02:34:49.801 --> 02:34:53.562]  You can also get our 10 to 1 mouthwash that is organic.
[02:34:53.562 --> 02:34:55.582]  Essential oils from Emerson Essentials.
[02:34:55.582 --> 02:34:57.123]  10 to 1.
[02:34:57.123 --> 02:34:57.963]  Stimulates gums.
[02:34:57.963 --> 02:34:58.643]  It's amazing.
[02:34:58.643 --> 02:34:59.344]  People just love it.
[02:34:59.344 --> 02:35:00.644]  It's real strong though.
[02:35:00.644 --> 02:35:01.684]  More like 20 to 1, I think.
[02:35:01.684 --> 02:35:02.345]  But they say it's 10 to 1.
[02:35:03.365 --> 02:35:12.532]  You can get all those discounted in the Advanced Oral Care Pack, or get them by themselves at Infowarslife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:35:12.532 --> 02:35:14.953]  And without you, we can't run this operation.
[02:35:14.953 --> 02:35:28.263]  So you get great products while funding the True Tip of the Spear, free shipping throughout the month of July as well, and a bunch of specials due in Wednesday because we're selling out of Rainforce, X2, Supermail, and other products that should be back in within a month or so.
[02:35:28.763 --> 02:35:31.866]  We can't continue those specials because they are running out.
[02:35:31.866 --> 02:35:33.487]  So take advantage of that today.
[02:35:33.487 --> 02:35:34.528]  And thank you for the support.
[02:35:34.528 --> 02:35:37.670]  Now, let's go to calls.
[02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:39.712]  Let's talk to... Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:35:39.712 --> 02:35:40.713]  Is it Doug?
[02:35:40.713 --> 02:35:42.034]  Is it Joshua?
[02:35:42.034 --> 02:35:43.075]  Is it Debbie?
[02:35:43.075 --> 02:35:44.636]  Is it Steve?
[02:35:44.636 --> 02:35:48.519]  Or... Or is it Mailman?
[02:35:48.519 --> 02:35:51.021]  Joshua's been holding the longest in Georgia.
[02:35:51.021 --> 02:35:51.602]  You're on the air.
[02:35:51.602 --> 02:35:53.923]  Thanks for calling.
[02:35:53.923 --> 02:35:55.745]  Alex, I'm just gonna go straight into it.
[02:35:56.681 --> 02:36:03.562]  Um, I worked, I was the Lead System Administrator for a company called CPSI.
[02:36:03.562 --> 02:36:11.364]  That's Computer Systems Programs Incorporated out of Mobile, Alabama.
[02:36:11.364 --> 02:36:19.566]  At the beginning of the year, they were caught orchestrating an attack against their own customers with ransomware with the FBI.
[02:36:19.566 --> 02:36:24.067]  I've been trying to go public since January, mainly with you since March of 2017.
[02:36:26.172 --> 02:36:33.094]  I've contacted all 100 senators, 50 governors, one mayor, 75 plus.
[02:36:33.094 --> 02:36:33.635]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:36:33.635 --> 02:36:37.876]  We don't screen phone calls, but I get, and I'm sure you're credible.
[02:36:37.876 --> 02:36:40.597]  I mean, I don't know that, but I'm sure you are.
[02:36:40.597 --> 02:36:45.779]  And so I'll get these calls where I've got to like vet things, look at it, figure it out.
[02:36:45.779 --> 02:36:52.621]  And I understand I get lots of stuff sent to me and they never can follow it up because we just don't have a big enough operation and so much is happening.
[02:36:52.621 --> 02:36:55.582]  Has there been anything in the news specifically about this company?
[02:36:57.378 --> 02:36:59.785]  No, I've been trying to go public.
[02:36:59.785 --> 02:37:02.915]  Okay, okay, I'm gonna get your name and number right now because...
[02:37:04.042 --> 02:37:08.005]  I'm not saying you're a fraud, but we're on the radio in Mobile, Alabama.
[02:37:08.005 --> 02:37:16.212]  It's one of our affiliates is there, and one way people like to get thrown off radio stations is they'll have somebody call in with an attack on a local business.
[02:37:16.212 --> 02:37:20.656]  Then it'll be misrepresented in the news that I made that attack on a local business.
[02:37:20.656 --> 02:37:22.477]  Then it'll be picked up nationally.
[02:37:22.477 --> 02:37:26.141]  Notice they'll show no proof that I said it, but they'll still do it.
[02:37:26.141 --> 02:37:30.845]  I'm not saying that's the case with you, but I'm going to get your name and number, and I'm going to give it to, say, Kit Daniels.
[02:37:31.505 --> 02:37:33.468]  And then you can send him some information.
[02:37:33.468 --> 02:37:39.598]  So please get that information from Joshua, Scott, and give that to Kit Daniels.
[02:37:39.598 --> 02:37:42.462]  But you're talking about domestic terrorism.
[02:37:42.462 --> 02:37:44.405]  I know that a lot of big companies like Google
[02:37:45.549 --> 02:37:51.173]  Have been caught spying on their users, and so has Apple, and so has Amazon.
[02:37:51.173 --> 02:37:53.095]  So, you know, there's no doubt that stuff goes on.
[02:37:53.095 --> 02:37:57.218]  I just don't know about the company you're talking about in particular, Joshua.
[02:37:57.218 --> 02:38:03.282]  And so again, I've got to, I mean, I have guests that come on and say random stuff as well to set me up.
[02:38:03.282 --> 02:38:06.485]  Everybody's seen that, and then the media says that I've said that.
[02:38:06.485 --> 02:38:09.487]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:38:09.487 --> 02:38:11.628]  Let's talk to Doug in California.
[02:38:11.628 --> 02:38:12.089]  You're on the air.
[02:38:14.079 --> 02:38:15.019]  Good morning.
[02:38:15.019 --> 02:38:17.840]  Good morning again, Alex.
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:22.601]  The Christian Lord Jesus must be looking down favorably on me because I called you twice and I'm on again.
[02:38:22.601 --> 02:38:39.286]  I was just talking about the immigration with guests around a week or so ago, and what I was trying to, the point I was trying to make was that with this new immigration law, what we have to make sure is that the Congress is going to be criminalizing the non-compliance of ICE holds with
[02:38:40.146 --> 02:38:40.887]  We're good.
[02:39:04.102 --> 02:39:04.402]  Thank you.
[02:39:25.974 --> 02:39:28.756]  Hey, good afternoon Alex.
[02:39:28.756 --> 02:39:31.438]  First of all, I wanted to give a
[02:39:54.850 --> 02:40:07.317]  I called and told your screener I wanted to talk about testimonies and first of all what I want to say is I've got a good friend that he was having major sinus and all kinds of problems like that.
[02:40:07.317 --> 02:40:10.899]  He's actually had surgery for polyps and he's just got a lot of problems.
[02:40:10.899 --> 02:40:16.723]  He's on antibiotics and so I gave him half a bottle of the silver bullet I had
[02:40:17.324 --> 02:40:22.728]  And it was amazing, within a day, he said all the green phlegm was gone, he's breathing a whole lot better.
[02:40:22.728 --> 02:40:34.195]  I told him to get the MycoZx and the biodefense probiotics because he's got issues with the, uh, um, uh, the, uh, what's that stuff called?
[02:40:34.195 --> 02:40:35.496]  Uh, the, uh... Candida?
[02:40:35.496 --> 02:40:36.517]  Uh, fungus.
[02:40:36.517 --> 02:40:37.377]  The fungus, yeah.
[02:40:37.377 --> 02:40:44.382]  And so, you know, I told him to get that, and then I also told him to get the Antangy Tangerine, which would help him a lot with his overall health.
[02:40:44.382 --> 02:40:45.683]  That's from M4's Health.com.
[02:40:45.683 --> 02:40:46.784]  It's amazing.
[02:40:46.784 --> 02:40:46.984]  Yeah.
[02:40:48.759 --> 02:40:58.570]  I just want to encourage everyone out there, before I get to that, I've heard some testimonies from people on the wrong side of these issues, but support this operation.
[02:40:58.570 --> 02:41:06.780]  This is like Alex says, it's your war bonds, you're putting the word out there, you're supporting what is supporting the truth, and that's what this is all about.
[02:41:07.481 --> 02:41:23.512]  And the reason this is important Alex, you know this, I've encountered people, the stuff they've said to me, I've gone to veterans and said, you know, I've seen them wearing a veteran's hat and say, hey, aren't you glad we finally got a real American in the White House now that's for our veterans?
[02:41:23.908 --> 02:41:25.609]  And they're telling me, well, I don't like Trump.
[02:41:25.609 --> 02:41:26.650]  And I'm like, why?
[02:41:26.650 --> 02:41:28.592]  Well, because he's getting rid of Obamacare.
[02:41:28.592 --> 02:41:37.299]  Well, I voted for Hillary, you know, because he wants to find out all the personal information for the voting situation, you know, and they're just uninformed about it.
[02:41:37.299 --> 02:41:40.342]  No, what Trump's doing is following federal law.
[02:41:40.842 --> 02:41:44.386]  To make sure illegals and dead people aren't voting, which they've caught them doing.
[02:41:44.386 --> 02:41:47.049]  The globalists came in, they're overthrowing our system.
[02:41:47.049 --> 02:41:49.351]  We're not against immigrants, we're a nation of immigrants.
[02:41:49.351 --> 02:41:55.377]  They're being used as a weapon and until that stops, we've got to get control of this situation.
[02:41:55.377 --> 02:41:56.479]  And that's the bottom line.
[02:41:56.479 --> 02:41:58.501]  God bless you and I appreciate your testimony.
[02:41:58.501 --> 02:41:59.942]  I'm going to say this as a layperson.
[02:42:01.141 --> 02:42:05.685]  From my own research about fungus and candida and mold.
[02:42:05.685 --> 02:42:09.830]  Okay, everybody knows, it's all over the news that it's causing brain tumors.
[02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:13.693]  It's causing, you know, most of the bats to die.
[02:42:13.693 --> 02:42:15.915]  Weird molds are killing turtles.
[02:42:15.915 --> 02:42:18.258]  Fungus is killing fish.
[02:42:18.258 --> 02:42:20.960]  I mean, it's mutating, it's out of control.
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:22.041]  Our environment's changing.
[02:42:22.041 --> 02:42:23.303]  These are the real environmental plagues.
[02:42:24.522 --> 02:42:30.667]  And from my research, and do your own, this is separate from me pitching MycoZx, this is from my research what's happening.
[02:42:30.667 --> 02:42:34.831]  They know that Candida fungus molds create
[02:42:36.636 --> 02:42:42.141]  These slime walls in your intestines and then they manipulate the metabolic system of your gut.
[02:42:42.141 --> 02:42:44.583]  That's what natural bacteria are supposed to do.
[02:42:44.583 --> 02:42:51.829]  And then they basically feed on the sugars and other things and then control basically your gut flora.
[02:42:51.829 --> 02:42:57.094]  And that's why people that have big yeast infections in their guts and other things are known to always want sugar and things.
[02:42:57.094 --> 02:42:58.415]  I mean, you see this on the news.
[02:42:58.415 --> 02:42:59.977]  This is what doctors are saying.
[02:42:59.977 --> 02:43:01.158]  Most of what I'm saying is just known.
[02:43:02.386 --> 02:43:16.218]  And then once it gets control of your gut, you're being colonized, then it gets control of your sinus, and then it starts getting into your blood, and then it gets into your brain, and a lot of the new brain tumors you read about are literal fungus tumors growing in people's brains.
[02:43:16.218 --> 02:43:18.279]  I mean, this is scary stuff.
[02:43:18.279 --> 02:43:20.701]  Now, am I saying MycoZx is going to knock all that out?
[02:43:20.701 --> 02:43:21.522]  No.
[02:43:21.522 --> 02:43:29.629]  It's known to go in with concentrated herbs and knock out the slime wall where it's taking control of your gut in your stomach, in your upper and lower intestines.
[02:43:30.856 --> 02:43:53.056]  Okay, and just like I've got so many friends and family who obviously don't want to come on here, but everybody knows about probiotics and it's just established that good probiotics are changing the world because bad pesticides get in our guts, they knock out the good bacteria, then the bad ones that are immune stay there, they fill up the area, but then the other areas get filled up with yeast, mold, stuff like candida.
[02:43:54.608 --> 02:44:01.611]  And I mean, a lot of people in this office that have been in the military, you name it, for 20 years, had irritable bowel, constantly having problems.
[02:44:01.611 --> 02:44:03.571]  I said, take Biome Defense.
[02:44:03.571 --> 02:44:06.252]  Two months later, no more irritable bowel.
[02:44:06.252 --> 02:44:11.514]  I have another very close friend who they told has Crohn's-like symptoms.
[02:44:11.514 --> 02:44:13.875]  This is before I ever had our Biome Defense.
[02:44:13.875 --> 02:44:21.898]  I said, go to Whole Foods, get one of their better full-spectrum probiotics, and it basically knocked it out for the person.
[02:44:23.122 --> 02:44:25.063]  We don't have the gut flora we need.
[02:44:25.063 --> 02:44:26.724]  So I went out with Groot.
[02:44:26.724 --> 02:44:28.225]  We produced bomb defense.
[02:44:28.225 --> 02:44:29.745]  Very best out there we could do.
[02:44:29.745 --> 02:44:30.326]  Excellent.
[02:44:30.326 --> 02:44:31.886]  And it goes great with the Mico ZX.
[02:44:31.886 --> 02:44:35.348]  But since we mentioned this, I'm going to go to break and come back after this.
[02:44:35.348 --> 02:44:37.329]  Here's Trevor Noah last week.
[02:44:37.329 --> 02:44:38.390]  This was like last Wednesday.
[02:44:38.390 --> 02:44:40.631]  I wasn't going to air it, but now I am.
[02:44:40.631 --> 02:44:41.931]  With some other comedian on there.
[02:44:41.931 --> 02:44:44.753]  Making jokes about myself and Gwyneth Paltrow.
[02:44:44.753 --> 02:44:46.674]  And not saying what I actually sell.
[02:44:46.674 --> 02:44:47.874]  Saying what she sells.
[02:44:47.874 --> 02:44:49.815]  Because she's got some funny names for her stuff.
[02:44:49.815 --> 02:44:50.656]  We've looked at the ingredients.
[02:44:50.656 --> 02:44:51.316]  It's pretty good stuff.
[02:44:52.771 --> 02:44:56.473]  Up against us and what we're doing.
[02:44:56.473 --> 02:44:58.653]  You know, Group has a degree from MIT.
[02:44:58.653 --> 02:45:05.616]  Group has a bunch of degrees because he has one in nutrition and one as a naturopath and one as a chiropractor.
[02:45:05.616 --> 02:45:06.517]  They make fun of that.
[02:45:06.517 --> 02:45:09.578]  Again, it's lying by omission.
[02:45:09.578 --> 02:45:10.458]  It's lying by omission.
[02:45:10.458 --> 02:45:11.999]  He's one of the top developers in the country.
[02:45:11.999 --> 02:45:16.521]  But I get stuff developed by the big companies that make stuff for Whole Foods.
[02:45:16.521 --> 02:45:19.102]  Group makes about half our line, but he's a great guy.
[02:45:19.102 --> 02:45:20.042]  He's highly respected.
[02:45:21.420 --> 02:45:23.862]  It's like our toothpaste is made by the folks that make Tom's of Maine.
[02:45:23.862 --> 02:45:25.483]  We just go get the best made.
[02:45:25.483 --> 02:45:26.704]  Colloidal silver.
[02:45:26.704 --> 02:45:28.446]  My wife had a sinus infection.
[02:45:28.446 --> 02:45:29.867]  Antibiotics weren't knocking her down.
[02:45:29.867 --> 02:45:31.948]  Three days ago, I started dumping colloidal silver down her nose.
[02:45:31.948 --> 02:45:34.210]  You have her lay over the bed, put it in, and it's gone away.
[02:45:34.210 --> 02:45:36.432]  Am I saying it's going to help every time?
[02:45:36.432 --> 02:45:40.175]  No, but silver's known to go after viruses and bacteria.
[02:45:40.175 --> 02:45:41.876]  It's been known by every culture.
[02:45:41.876 --> 02:45:43.377]  It's not debatable.
[02:45:43.377 --> 02:45:48.842]  At the hospitals, they have advantages now with silver because everything else stopped working.
[02:45:48.842 --> 02:45:50.223]  But they don't want you to know that.
[02:45:51.596 --> 02:45:54.057]  I've been promoting silver for 20 years.
[02:45:54.057 --> 02:45:59.799]  You go into a Walgreens now, or a CVS, they've got 20 products with it in it.
[02:45:59.799 --> 02:46:01.039]  Silver gels, you name it.
[02:46:01.039 --> 02:46:03.280]  And it's not even as good as the stuff we sell.
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:05.380]  But it works.
[02:46:05.380 --> 02:46:08.061]  So they're demonizing normal behavior.
[02:46:08.061 --> 02:46:09.322]  Is it going to help you every time?
[02:46:09.322 --> 02:46:10.942]  Should you take silver and not antibiotics?
[02:46:10.942 --> 02:46:13.263]  No, that's your decision.
[02:46:13.263 --> 02:46:14.983]  There's a lot of stuff silver won't knock out.
[02:46:14.983 --> 02:46:19.765]  It's one more weapon against these bugs that are becoming totally immune!
[02:46:20.922 --> 02:46:22.502]  And I hope it keeps working!
[02:46:22.502 --> 02:46:24.863]  It may stop!
[02:46:24.863 --> 02:46:27.284]  I've got children, man!
[02:46:27.284 --> 02:46:28.764]  But they make a joke out of all this.
[02:46:28.764 --> 02:46:30.405]  Let's go to this demonization piece.
[02:46:30.405 --> 02:46:30.705]  Here it is.
[02:46:30.705 --> 02:46:34.186]  It'll probably be a long time before we know the full Russia-Trump story.
[02:46:34.186 --> 02:46:35.266]  One thing is clear.
[02:46:35.266 --> 02:46:37.247]  America is really divided right now.
[02:46:37.247 --> 02:46:39.448]  The big question is, where is this headed?
[02:46:39.448 --> 02:46:41.648]  A civil war or a dance-off?
[02:46:41.648 --> 02:46:47.090]  For more on this deep division, please welcome to the show our newest Daily Show correspondent, Mr. Michael Kosta!
[02:46:51.773 --> 02:46:53.295]  Well, thanks Trevor.
[02:46:53.295 --> 02:46:59.782]  It's great to be here, but just so you know, it's actually Doctor... Let's back up a few seconds.
[02:46:59.782 --> 02:47:02.665]  With this other comedian on there.
[02:47:02.665 --> 02:47:06.469]  They hold up signs saying cheer at the times they want, see?
[02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:07.630]  All fake, all staged.
[02:47:07.630 --> 02:47:08.051]  Let's continue.
[02:47:11.778 --> 02:47:11.978]  Yay!
[02:47:11.978 --> 02:47:12.719]  We all agree with you.
[02:47:12.719 --> 02:47:13.960]  Put pressure.
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:14.700]  Thanks, Trevor.
[02:47:14.700 --> 02:47:19.343]  It's great to be here, but just so you know, it's actually Dr. Michael Kostin that... Wait, wait.
[02:47:19.343 --> 02:47:20.584]  You're an actual doctor?
[02:47:20.584 --> 02:47:21.024]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:21.024 --> 02:47:24.366]  According to MedicalCertificateOnline.com, I am.
[02:47:24.366 --> 02:47:25.988]  So, that's a... Pause again.
[02:47:25.988 --> 02:47:26.908]  Blank.
[02:47:26.908 --> 02:47:29.790]  They don't say who's saying they're a doctor when they're not.
[02:47:29.790 --> 02:47:30.931]  They don't say who's a fraud.
[02:47:30.931 --> 02:47:36.375]  It's like they say, Alex Jones is deeply racist, unalloyed racist, and then don't show the clip.
[02:47:36.375 --> 02:47:39.797]  He just holds up a piece of white paper and says, we're all fakes.
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:46.747]  That's why the royalty chose to eat off silver even when they could eat off gold?
[02:47:46.747 --> 02:47:54.197]  Is that why they kept milk in cellars to keep it cold in Old England and France and kept it in silver containers?
[02:47:54.197 --> 02:47:58.362]  And they found milk lasted longer when kept cold and in silver?
[02:47:59.662 --> 02:48:19.939]  Or they thought it was wivetails when the British, 200 years before anybody else discovered vitamin C, and they gave limes to their sailors so they wouldn't get scurvy so they could be 2,000 miles from home and pull up to a Spanish or Dutch ship and defeat them because they were all weak from no vitamin C and the limeys, that's why Brits are called limeys,
[02:48:21.058 --> 02:48:27.506]  The limeys, they put the lime in the water, in the rum, in the grog.
[02:48:27.506 --> 02:48:28.207]  The limeys.
[02:48:28.207 --> 02:48:30.009]  But see, I'm informed.
[02:48:30.009 --> 02:48:35.215]  I know you'd die without vitamin C. But see, to them, this is all a big joke.
[02:48:35.215 --> 02:48:39.680]  Something to make fun of what selenium does.
[02:48:40.825 --> 02:48:43.088]  Or what silver does to your gums.
[02:48:43.088 --> 02:48:44.489]  They don't want you to know.
[02:48:44.489 --> 02:48:58.124]  They think it's all funny that in the old days when they'd travel with milk on wagon trains out west, when they couldn't keep stuff refrigerated, they'd throw silver dollars into the milk and into the buttermilk.
[02:48:58.124 --> 02:48:59.186]  See, they don't want you knowing that.
[02:48:59.186 --> 02:49:00.727]  They want to just make it all a big joke.
[02:49:00.727 --> 02:49:01.168]  Let's continue.
[02:49:02.190 --> 02:49:03.710]  That's a blank.
[02:49:03.710 --> 02:49:09.072]  Now Trevor, as a professional doctor, I'm here to prescribe a cure for America's division.
[02:49:09.072 --> 02:49:11.172]  A spoonful of optimism.
[02:49:11.172 --> 02:49:15.414]  It may seem that Americans are being driven apart, but plenty are coming together.
[02:49:15.414 --> 02:49:18.394]  Take right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:49:18.394 --> 02:49:20.655]  He runs InfoWars.
[02:49:20.655 --> 02:49:22.035]  I was told by a genetic engineer.
[02:49:25.310 --> 02:49:29.992]  About a project they were on in England once, and I never told the story on air because it's so fantastical.
[02:49:29.992 --> 02:49:35.054]  They had on tanks people with gills, and they were little babies, and they were in there just gulping and clawing at the sides.
[02:49:35.054 --> 02:49:38.576]  You see a turtle at the zoo, and it wants out, and you feel for it.
[02:49:38.576 --> 02:49:41.657]  They got humanoids crossed with fish and stuff.
[02:49:41.657 --> 02:49:45.358]  I mean... We are screwed, people!
[02:49:45.358 --> 02:49:47.139]  I mean, do you understand that?
[02:49:47.139 --> 02:49:48.240]  Hey, pause it again.
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:49.020]  Back it up three seconds.
[02:49:50.649 --> 02:49:58.438]  So just type in MIT, human-animal chimeras are gestating on farms across the United States last year.
[02:49:58.438 --> 02:50:07.889]  I can show you a thousand medical reports or more from major universities going back 30 years with human-animal hybrids and I was told
[02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:23.735]  At a conference in New York by a well-known genetic engineer who'd whistled blue on GMO, who'd been on the show, off record, over drinks, that he and his colleagues had been involved in government projects where they were splicing humans, animals, fish, you name it.
[02:50:24.435 --> 02:50:34.700]  And he said, when you see a pig with a human face, or you see what looks like a pinniped with a human face, that's a seal, or even a fish, it is scary.
[02:50:34.700 --> 02:50:41.883]  I can Google right now and show you mice with human faces, mice with ears growing on them, cockroaches with microchips in them 25 years ago.
[02:50:42.543 --> 02:50:43.865]  But see, they don't care.
[02:50:43.865 --> 02:50:45.767]  You can go search it yourself.
[02:50:45.767 --> 02:50:47.930]  They don't want it discussed.
[02:50:47.930 --> 02:50:52.596]  They're inoculating everyone to accept it as they now roll it out.
[02:50:52.596 --> 02:50:58.944]  The Chinese announced yesterday dogs that are three times more muscular created in test tubes and then give birth to them.
[02:51:00.439 --> 02:51:05.460]  And now they're about to start announcing that they've cloned the humans that are superhuman.
[02:51:05.460 --> 02:51:07.461]  That was mainstream news Sunday.
[02:51:07.461 --> 02:51:09.481]  But see, mainstream media can report it.
[02:51:09.481 --> 02:51:14.982]  When I report it decades before, just like NSA spying, it's more kooky.
[02:51:14.982 --> 02:51:19.423]  I had a woman at Barton Springs public outside pool with my kids this weekend.
[02:51:19.423 --> 02:51:21.164]  It's a spring-fed pool.
[02:51:21.164 --> 02:51:23.344]  And I'm out there and she walks over and she goes, Hi, are you Alex Jones?
[02:51:23.344 --> 02:51:23.644]  I said, yeah.
[02:51:23.644 --> 02:51:26.025]  She goes, Oh, are the fish going to watch you with little cameras?
[02:51:27.213 --> 02:51:33.375]  And I went, um, no, I mean, I just reported on the appliances watching and listening to people, uh, you know, decades ago from whistleblowers.
[02:51:33.375 --> 02:51:34.376]  I said, it's now confirmed.
[02:51:34.376 --> 02:51:35.836]  I said, isn't it confirmed?
[02:51:35.836 --> 02:51:38.217]  She went, just kept smiling.
[02:51:38.217 --> 02:51:45.941]  And I was like, okay, well, I mean, I, I, are you just trying to just hit on me or something?
[02:51:45.941 --> 02:51:48.221]  And I guess that's kind of what it was.
[02:51:48.221 --> 02:51:52.803]  But even for her, she thought that it would just be cutesy to do that.
[02:51:52.803 --> 02:51:54.944]  It's not cutesy.
[02:51:54.944 --> 02:51:56.485]  You could buy 20 years ago.
[02:51:57.293 --> 02:52:07.046]  In Hong Kong bazaars, this was like CBS News 20 years ago, rhesus monkeys that are part jellyfish and glow blue.
[02:52:07.046 --> 02:52:14.476]  And it's said though that sometimes they, the stinging cells grow too large and then you have to put the monkeys down because it starts burning them.
[02:52:16.775 --> 02:52:18.256]  The stinging cells.
[02:52:18.256 --> 02:52:22.437]  I mean, they were selling jellyfish monkeys 20 years ago.
[02:52:22.437 --> 02:52:23.858]  That's mainstream news, folks.
[02:52:23.858 --> 02:52:25.218]  This isn't a joke.
[02:52:25.218 --> 02:52:38.983]  But we're in this compartmentalized world right next to all this advanced technology, but we can't have a debate about it because the average man is too busy talking about fantasy football, strutting around, acting tough to other men.
[02:52:38.983 --> 02:52:40.404]  There it is, MIT Technology Review.
[02:52:40.404 --> 02:52:41.564]  Oh, they'll tell us about it.
[02:52:41.564 --> 02:52:43.525]  Glowing monkeys inherit jellyfish genes.
[02:52:45.134 --> 02:52:46.575]  Oh, MIT told us that years ago.
[02:52:46.575 --> 02:52:51.818]  Folks, I'm telling you, I mean, I was reading this stuff on air 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[02:52:51.818 --> 02:52:52.619]  But again, it doesn't matter.
[02:52:52.619 --> 02:53:05.186]  Trevor Noah will edit it out, and I'll go, there's little monkeys that are part jellyfish, and it's painful, and they'll just go, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, even though their editors know they cut out the clips where I showed you the articles.
[02:53:05.186 --> 02:53:10.089]  Sean unveils gene technology to create superhumans with hypermuscular test tube dogs.
[02:53:10.089 --> 02:53:11.210]  They're not test tube dogs.
[02:53:11.210 --> 02:53:12.191]  Scroll down, look at one.
[02:53:13.322 --> 02:53:17.347]  More than a decade ago, China rolled out human milk producing cows.
[02:53:17.347 --> 02:53:18.508]  They're part human.
[02:53:18.508 --> 02:53:19.810]  Okay.
[02:53:19.810 --> 02:53:23.834]  Let's go ahead now and go back to Trevor Noah and then I'll go to your calls.
[02:53:23.834 --> 02:53:25.256]  Here's the rest of this BS.
[02:53:28.928 --> 02:53:31.390]  Humanoids cross with fish, so mermaids.
[02:53:31.390 --> 02:53:33.051]  You hate mermaids?
[02:53:33.051 --> 02:53:34.091]  Who hates mermaids?
[02:53:34.091 --> 02:53:39.094]  Now, you wouldn't think that guy has much in common with, say... Back it up ten seconds.
[02:53:39.094 --> 02:53:43.517]  So, you got humans crossed with aquatic life.
[02:53:44.827 --> 02:53:50.811]  And they're gulping, and they're horrified, and they're in cages, just like a turtle, you know, a huge turtle at the zoo.
[02:53:50.811 --> 02:53:55.815]  They got the San Antonio Zoo's got like the biggest alligator stabbing turtle I've ever seen in a tank, basically the size of his body.
[02:53:55.815 --> 02:53:57.116]  And it's just like, ooh!
[02:53:57.116 --> 02:53:59.458]  I mean, I feel for it.
[02:53:59.458 --> 02:54:01.419]  But see, he doesn't want you to feel.
[02:54:01.419 --> 02:54:04.261]  Now I'm racist against mermaids, see?
[02:54:04.261 --> 02:54:06.503]  I don't want these creatures living in cages.
[02:54:06.503 --> 02:54:07.884]  I want to have a debate about it.
[02:54:07.884 --> 02:54:09.165]  I want them to have rights.
[02:54:09.165 --> 02:54:12.227]  And so, I'm a bigot!
[02:54:12.227 --> 02:54:12.907]  See how that works?
[02:54:12.907 --> 02:54:13.408]  Let's continue.
[02:54:14.440 --> 02:54:16.442]  It's cross with fish, so mermaids.
[02:54:16.442 --> 02:54:18.123]  You hate mermaids?
[02:54:18.123 --> 02:54:19.144]  Who hates mermaids?
[02:54:19.144 --> 02:54:25.389]  Now, you wouldn't think that guy has much in common with, say, Hollywood Gwyneth Paltrow, the founder of Goop.
[02:54:25.389 --> 02:54:31.715]  That's her website where she markets an alternative brand of wellness that, for some reason, her followers pay actual money for.
[02:54:31.715 --> 02:54:33.276]  I've always been that person.
[02:54:34.144 --> 02:54:54.931]  But Big Pharma, they have drug ads, they have all their other ads on there, where at the end of the drug ad it tells you all the ways it can kill you, the opioids, the Prozac-type drugs, the blood thinners, all the fake statins that literally eat your brain and eat your liver and admit it to be total frauds, and Tylenol that's worse than a bottle of Jack Daniels they now admit, you know, give that to kids, that's okay.
[02:54:54.931 --> 02:54:56.172]  They run all this poison.
[02:54:57.079 --> 02:55:14.228]  They sexualize your kids and then they make fun of Gwyneth Paltrow that she dare have her own line of supplements because that might cut in on Jeff Bezos and Whole Foods and Amazon and the 600 million a year to fund the Washington Post trying to kill the recovery of this country.
[02:55:14.228 --> 02:55:18.170]  The word is you don't get to sell products and then fund your own political views.
[02:55:18.690 --> 02:55:23.973]  You watch our big pharma ads and get ready to drop dead because these little guys are funny.
[02:55:23.973 --> 02:55:26.595]  They're the anointed comics on Trevor Noah.
[02:55:26.595 --> 02:55:28.656]  Here it is.
[02:55:28.656 --> 02:55:36.341]  ...who has sort of introduced the culture or the media to things that people think are weird.
[02:55:36.341 --> 02:55:41.044]  I usually make my own smoothie with a lot of different moon juice powders.
[02:55:41.044 --> 02:55:46.067]  There's great proteins and adaptogens and things to help with adrenal fatigue.
[02:55:46.067 --> 02:55:46.328]  It was.
[02:55:47.248 --> 02:55:48.649]  Oh my gosh, adrenal fatigue.
[02:55:48.649 --> 02:55:51.551]  Oh my gosh, all these herbs and things and eating healthy.
[02:55:51.551 --> 02:55:52.911]  Oh my god, so easy.
[02:55:52.911 --> 02:55:54.452]  This is whacked out!
[02:55:54.452 --> 02:56:02.157]  This healthy looking woman and she's telling you about, you know, how to take things for your immune system when they admit our immune systems are cratering.
[02:56:02.157 --> 02:56:03.758]  This woman is the enemy!
[02:56:03.758 --> 02:56:06.399]  Let's continue.
[02:56:06.399 --> 02:56:12.003]  Perhaps nothing is more interesting than the TMI topic of vaginal steaming.
[02:56:12.003 --> 02:56:13.584]  She was in a movie about chemtrails too.
[02:56:16.846 --> 02:56:18.067]  Vaginal steaming.
[02:56:18.067 --> 02:56:23.309]  So everybody's always known from the Native Americans, you name it, go get in the hot water, steam your body.
[02:56:23.309 --> 02:56:28.832]  They'll tell you, people that have other problems with their bodies, go steam for your skin, for your body.
[02:56:28.832 --> 02:56:31.153]  But oh, oh, this is kooky.
[02:56:31.153 --> 02:56:32.153]  This is kooky.
[02:56:32.153 --> 02:56:34.654]  Again, only mainstream media can be your guru.
[02:56:34.654 --> 02:56:36.795]  Let's go back to it.
[02:56:36.795 --> 02:56:38.236]  Wow.
[02:56:38.236 --> 02:56:40.217]  Vaginal steaming?
[02:56:40.217 --> 02:56:44.099]  That phrase is both too much information and somehow not enough information.
[02:56:45.788 --> 02:56:47.808]  Well, it's pretty clear to me, frankly.
[02:56:47.808 --> 02:56:48.549]  Okay, but I'm confused.
[02:56:48.549 --> 02:56:50.909]  Why are we talking about Gwyneth Paltrow and Alex Jones?
[02:56:50.909 --> 02:56:54.190]  Because they show us how not-divided America is.
[02:56:54.190 --> 02:56:56.711]  You think they have nothing in common, but they do.
[02:56:56.711 --> 02:57:01.652]  On both their websites, they push a lot of the same strange dietary supplements.
[02:57:01.652 --> 02:57:03.392]  The exact same supplements.
[02:57:03.392 --> 02:57:04.992]  They just market them differently.
[02:57:04.992 --> 02:57:10.614]  Take MACA, a supplement that's said to increase sex drive, which I bought but do not need.
[02:57:10.614 --> 02:57:10.754]  Now...
[02:57:12.414 --> 02:57:17.236]  On Goop, you can find maca in their moon juice sex dust.
[02:57:17.236 --> 02:57:21.458]  But on InfoWars, it's super male vitality!
[02:57:21.458 --> 02:57:24.059]  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
[02:57:24.059 --> 02:57:30.682]  Both sites also recommend alternative remedies like active silver, oolithera root, and deboned salmon enemas.
[02:57:34.644 --> 02:57:46.670]  I wonder why they're so similar, because we go out and research what's known to really work, what's clean sources, and doesn't have side effects, and is seen as FDA, key term, grass certified.
[02:57:46.670 --> 02:57:49.491]  Meaning the government says it's safe and good.
[02:57:49.491 --> 02:57:50.512]  Do you understand?
[02:57:50.512 --> 02:57:56.435]  That's why we sell it, because it's popular, because it works.
[02:57:56.435 --> 02:58:00.257]  And ours is cold pressed and concentrated into a fine oil.
[02:58:01.581 --> 02:58:02.763]  Quite frankly, better than the powder.
[02:58:02.763 --> 02:58:06.248]  We also sell Androplex's lower price, the same as her sex dust.
[02:58:06.248 --> 02:58:07.009]  Why is it so similar?
[02:58:07.009 --> 02:58:08.291]  I didn't even know she sold this.
[02:58:08.291 --> 02:58:11.576]  Because these are the things that WORK!
[02:58:11.576 --> 02:58:13.099]  That's why we sell them.
[02:58:13.099 --> 02:58:14.761]  We want them to WORK!
[02:58:14.761 --> 02:58:16.023]  So you buy them again, DUH!
[02:58:19.371 --> 02:58:20.472]  It gets funnier.
[02:58:20.472 --> 02:58:21.332]  Who do we got coming up?
[02:58:21.332 --> 02:58:22.853]  We got Lord Knight.
[02:58:22.853 --> 02:58:25.174]  I'm gonna cuddle a little bit with him.
[02:58:25.174 --> 02:58:26.315]  I promise, I'm going to Debbie.
[02:58:26.315 --> 02:58:28.436]  I'm going to Mailman.
[02:58:28.436 --> 02:58:29.216]  I'm going to Gus.
[02:58:29.216 --> 02:58:29.857]  I'm going to Eric.
[02:58:29.857 --> 02:58:30.697]  I'm going to Craig.
[02:58:30.697 --> 02:58:31.938]  But I gotta finish this as well.
[02:58:31.938 --> 02:58:33.479]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:33.479 --> 02:58:35.059]  Hour number four is straight ahead.
[02:58:35.059 --> 02:58:37.821]  If you simply spread the link and spread the word, nothing can stop you.
[02:58:37.821 --> 02:58:39.262]  You are the human intelligence.
[02:58:39.262 --> 02:58:43.024]  We will override the AI and be victorious because of you.
[02:58:43.024 --> 02:58:43.524]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.524 --> 02:58:46.165]  Hour number four is only 70 seconds away.
[02:58:46.165 --> 02:58:47.326]  This is the Info War.
[02:58:47.667 --> 02:58:50.596]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.596 --> 02:58:52.643]  Aquaman summons three giant whales!
[02:58:54.238 --> 02:58:56.119]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:58:56.119 --> 02:58:57.439]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:58:57.439 --> 02:58:58.640]  Why is this so good?
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:03.942]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:59:03.942 --> 02:59:17.487]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:59:17.487 --> 02:59:18.848]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:59:19.628 --> 02:59:21.270]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:59:21.270 --> 02:59:23.833]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:59:23.833 --> 02:59:25.134]  These are all parasites.
[02:59:25.134 --> 02:59:26.255]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:59:26.255 --> 02:59:27.597]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:59:27.597 --> 02:59:32.102]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:59:32.102 --> 02:59:35.245]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[02:59:35.325 --> 02:59:38.407]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:59:38.407 --> 02:59:39.468]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:59:39.468 --> 02:59:41.409]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:41.409 --> 02:59:42.430]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:59:42.430 --> 02:59:45.111]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:59:45.111 --> 02:59:47.053]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:59:47.053 --> 02:59:48.394]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:48.394 --> 02:59:50.635]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:59:50.635 --> 02:59:56.679]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:59:56.679 --> 02:59:59.301]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.455 --> 03:00:13.298]  Another time.
[03:00:13.298 --> 03:00:14.622]  In the Age of Wonder.
[03:00:21.707 --> 03:00:24.469]  We're about to go back to where we were.
[03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:32.095]  We're about to go back to the future.
[03:00:32.095 --> 03:00:36.719]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:36.719 --> 03:00:42.743]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:49.344 --> 03:00:51.306]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[03:00:51.306 --> 03:00:52.346]  We're into hour number four.
[03:00:52.346 --> 03:00:54.348]  I'm going to coast a little bit with David Knight, who's coming in the next segment.
[03:00:54.348 --> 03:00:55.909]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[03:00:55.909 --> 03:00:56.330]  I promise.
[03:00:56.330 --> 03:01:12.843]  But let me finish up with the demonization of Gwyneth Paltrow and yours truly for daring to sell supplements, the very same compounds, because we want to sell the best sellers, you know, that's what works, just recompound and make them better, that Whole Foods sells.
[03:01:14.005 --> 03:01:14.906]  The GNC sells.
[03:01:14.906 --> 03:01:28.034]  I mean, we sell, I know for a fact, coming out this week, the same whey powder that a top company sells it nationwide for, and we're gonna sell it for $6 less per container.
[03:01:28.034 --> 03:01:29.876]  Same thing.
[03:01:29.876 --> 03:01:37.020]  Other stuff I'm selling for way less than what, I mean, but again, D Magazine and others said, look, he sells coffee.
[03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:43.405]  They believe that you're so weak-minded that you think it's kooky that I, there it is on screen, that I would sell coffee.
[03:01:44.457 --> 03:01:45.842]  Coffee!
[03:01:45.842 --> 03:01:46.083]  Coffee!
[03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:52.393]  Are Gwyneth Paltrow and Alex Jones on the same alt health page?
[03:01:52.393 --> 03:01:59.500]  Again, this is like just attempts to create this synergy because they know putting my name in things gets ratings up.
[03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:00.100]  Which is great.
[03:02:00.100 --> 03:02:01.602]  It's great for us too.
[03:02:01.602 --> 03:02:05.825]  It's just that, believe me, the failing, dying media has to pick fights with us to get attention.
[03:02:05.825 --> 03:02:08.648]  But in the aggregate, they have a much bigger audience all in together.
[03:02:08.648 --> 03:02:15.193]  So I play along with them as I'm sucking their audience out of them and waking them up and loving every minute of it.
[03:02:15.950 --> 03:02:21.732]  So let's go back to the demonization piece with some teleprompter reading, guys, that a whole room full of writers put together.
[03:02:21.732 --> 03:02:23.073]  Here it is.
[03:02:23.073 --> 03:02:30.256]  Both sites also recommend alternative remedies like active silver, ulitharowroot, and deboned salmon enemas.
[03:02:30.256 --> 03:02:33.137]  Okay, I made that last one up, but... Back it up again.
[03:02:33.137 --> 03:02:35.939]  Notice they say poison there.
[03:02:35.939 --> 03:02:38.860]  They mix in pretty much subliminally, just like they put a Hitler mustache.
[03:02:39.929 --> 03:02:43.090]  Very lightly on the cover of, was it Time or Newsweek?
[03:02:43.090 --> 03:02:44.151]  I forget.
[03:02:44.151 --> 03:02:44.631]  Donald Trump Jr.
[03:02:44.631 --> 03:02:45.791]  where it says, caught red-handed.
[03:02:45.791 --> 03:02:47.012]  Pull that up for me, please.
[03:02:47.012 --> 03:02:49.813]  Poisoned.
[03:02:49.813 --> 03:02:50.993]  Poseidon extreme.
[03:02:50.993 --> 03:02:55.034]  And then it's got ocean flow formula.
[03:02:55.034 --> 03:02:58.016]  Again, none of that's true.
[03:02:58.016 --> 03:03:00.076]  Again, Hitler mustache.
[03:03:00.076 --> 03:03:01.437]  The Russians aren't even communists anymore.
[03:03:01.437 --> 03:03:02.337]  Red-handed.
[03:03:02.337 --> 03:03:03.898]  Lie after lie after lie.
[03:03:03.898 --> 03:03:04.398]  Let's continue.
[03:03:06.058 --> 03:03:10.980]  Okay, I made that last one up, but we all know when you lose the bones, you lose the health benefits.
[03:03:10.980 --> 03:03:23.024]  Okay, Michael, so Gwyneth Paltrow puts the same herbs in her green smoothies as Alex Jones puts on his pizza steaks, but I still don't understand what this has to do with a divided America.
[03:03:23.024 --> 03:03:24.785]  Of course not, you don't have a medical degree.
[03:03:26.732 --> 03:03:28.553]  Trevor, do you know what this is?
[03:03:28.553 --> 03:03:29.894]  A horseshoe?
[03:03:29.894 --> 03:03:30.554]  Wrong.
[03:03:30.554 --> 03:03:35.818]  This is a symbol of a political theory named the Horseshoe Theory of Politics.
[03:03:35.818 --> 03:03:46.264]  Now it states the far left and the far right, rather than being at opposite ends of a linear political continuum, in reality closely resemble one another, much like the ends of a horseshoe.
[03:03:46.264 --> 03:03:48.425]  So it's actually a horseshoe.
[03:03:51.556 --> 03:03:52.777]  Gwyneth is here.
[03:03:52.777 --> 03:03:54.078]  Alex is here.
[03:03:54.078 --> 03:03:55.198]  Pretty close.
[03:03:55.198 --> 03:03:58.280]  In fact, the extreme fringes have a ton in common.
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:03:59.961]  Both don't believe in vaccines.
[03:03:59.961 --> 03:04:02.363]  Both think 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:04:02.363 --> 03:04:04.004]  Both like birds.
[03:04:04.004 --> 03:04:10.007]  You know, when you think about it, the movie Birdman, isn't that really just a fancy duck dynasty?
[03:04:10.007 --> 03:04:10.368]  What?
[03:04:10.368 --> 03:04:11.989]  Birdman is nothing like duck dynasty.
[03:04:11.989 --> 03:04:16.972]  The point is, maybe we can all learn from the extremes and focus on what brings us together.
[03:04:16.972 --> 03:04:20.014]  A healthy skepticism of authority and, well,
[03:04:21.095 --> 03:04:23.516]  A powdered drink that gives you boners.
[03:04:23.516 --> 03:04:26.378]  I mean if it'll bring us together in America.
[03:04:31.041 --> 03:04:36.564]  The true political spectrum is tyranny on one end, liberty on the other, and where you want to be in that spectrum.
[03:04:36.564 --> 03:04:41.426]  And a libertarian constitutional republic is about 80% towards basically total anarchy.
[03:04:41.426 --> 03:04:46.249]  But you can't ever have total anarchy because then it always creates back to the first stage.
[03:04:46.249 --> 03:04:49.931]  But you want as most limited government, all based on individual achievement.
[03:04:49.931 --> 03:04:51.411]  That builds men.
[03:04:51.411 --> 03:04:53.092]  Just giving people things creates monsters.
[03:04:53.092 --> 03:04:54.633]  That's a historical fact.
[03:04:54.633 --> 03:04:57.935]  We'll be right back with your phone calls, I promise, right out of the gate.
[03:04:57.935 --> 03:04:59.316]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:05:00.276 --> 03:05:04.317]  They misrepresent it because they hate it, because it will defeat them.
[03:05:04.317 --> 03:05:10.378]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[03:05:10.378 --> 03:05:11.898]  The contest is simple.
[03:05:11.898 --> 03:05:16.959]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[03:05:16.959 --> 03:05:24.521]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[03:05:24.701 --> 03:05:31.346]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:31.346 --> 03:05:41.413]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[03:05:41.413 --> 03:05:48.898]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[03:05:49.158 --> 03:05:59.241]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[03:05:59.241 --> 03:06:02.603]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[03:06:02.603 --> 03:06:03.543]  This is Kit Daniels.
[03:06:05.205 --> 03:06:09.027]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[03:06:09.027 --> 03:06:10.528]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[03:06:10.528 --> 03:06:12.248]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.

[03:06:14.670 --> 03:06:15.870]  It's been sold out for months.
[03:06:15.870 --> 03:06:16.771]  Big waiting list.
[03:06:16.771 --> 03:06:20.613]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[03:06:20.613 --> 03:06:21.493]  Nobody's got something this good.
[03:06:21.513 --> 03:06:22.193]  We're good to go.
[03:06:43.279 --> 03:06:45.141]  10% off when you choose auto ship.
[03:06:45.141 --> 03:06:50.926]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[03:06:50.926 --> 03:06:51.506]  Now it's epidemic.
[03:06:51.506 --> 03:06:54.469]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them.
[03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:56.871]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.

[03:08:10.043 --> 03:08:15.587]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:08:15.587 --> 03:08:19.390]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:19.390 --> 03:08:21.312]  Well, coming up, what is it?
[03:08:21.312 --> 03:08:25.715]  August 20th, David Nights could be the first guy to kick off the new line of broadcasts we're gonna have here.
[03:08:26.616 --> 03:08:34.139]  And then coming up on September 4th, we're going to kick off with Owen Schroyer, Roger Stone, and of course, Mike Cernovich.
[03:08:34.139 --> 03:08:41.503]  That's going to be very, very powerful transmission every day at 4 o'clock, at 3 o'clock Central, 4 o'clock Eastern.
[03:08:41.503 --> 03:08:43.203]  So that's all coming up.
[03:08:43.203 --> 03:08:51.847]  I'm going to go right to your calls for folks that have been holding patiently, Debbie, Baste, Mailman, Gus, Eric, and Craig in this segment.
[03:08:51.847 --> 03:08:53.548]  But David, tell folks what you've got coming up.
[03:08:54.341 --> 03:09:03.910]  Alex, we talked on Friday about this GOP operative who was going to expose the Clintons, and we talked about the suspicious circumstances of his suicide.
[03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:10.116]  Now we've got a Haitian official who's going to testify on Tuesday about the Clinton Foundation in Haiti.
[03:09:10.797 --> 03:09:12.858]  And he committed suicide over the weekend.
[03:09:40.737 --> 03:09:42.417]  And Pocahontas, so that was the plan.
[03:09:42.417 --> 03:09:43.057]  That's right.
[03:09:43.057 --> 03:09:44.938]  And Ezekiel Emanuel, so that was the plan.
[03:09:44.938 --> 03:09:51.539]  And we told people, it's designed to screw you over by big mega banks, and the left said, no, no it's not, it's something free for me!
[03:09:51.539 --> 03:10:04.181]  Just like, I'm going to win the Nigerian email, I'm rich now, the lottery's real, they just will not admit they're conned, and then they want to go get more worthless educations, and they want to make us their slaves, because they're chumps to the globalists.
[03:10:04.181 --> 03:10:06.582]  So how do we protect ourselves from all these chumps?
[03:10:07.202 --> 03:10:18.708]  Well, you know, interestingly, Alex, on Friday when we talked about this, you mentioned the fact that while you got the National Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who are trying to push this single-payer system, in California they've been looking at it for a long time.
[03:10:18.708 --> 03:10:26.712]  Jerry Brown, who's now the governor, back in the 90s was campaigning on that, and he just said, you can't solve a problem by making the problem bigger.
[03:10:26.712 --> 03:10:28.433]  Where's the money going to come from?
[03:10:28.433 --> 03:10:30.214]  And finally they hit the wall.
[03:10:30.214 --> 03:10:34.336]  Venezuela or North Korea, they're about to collapse, and then guess what?
[03:10:34.336 --> 03:10:36.097]  You ain't getting nothing now!
[03:10:36.417 --> 03:10:36.817]  That's right.
[03:10:36.817 --> 03:10:44.640]  Once you wreck everything, you dumb slobs that love the New World Order, you destroyed the golden goosey-woosey.
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:52.003]  I mean, again, I hate the globalists, but they're all exempt offshore, and they talk about the public like they're the biggest idiots on Earth.
[03:10:52.003 --> 03:11:01.366]  And when I've been invited to go to the Kissinger Group, or invited to join the globalists, and offered $10 million contracts, all that, people go, oh, you weren't offered that, now look, we're ten times bigger than that.
[03:11:02.452 --> 03:11:06.934]  Just like people go, oh, you didn't have, you know, 7 million views of that video this weekend.
[03:11:06.934 --> 03:11:09.076]  Oh, I'm sorry, it's like 10 million now.
[03:11:09.076 --> 03:11:11.337]  People just can't understand.
[03:11:11.337 --> 03:11:13.118]  We are for real!
[03:11:13.118 --> 03:11:15.999]  Do you have that through your head?
[03:11:15.999 --> 03:11:17.660]  We know what we're talking about.
[03:11:17.660 --> 03:11:19.261]  We want you to be prosperous.
[03:11:19.261 --> 03:11:20.962]  We want to turn things around.
[03:11:20.962 --> 03:11:22.263]  We're the good guys.
[03:11:22.263 --> 03:11:23.824]  That's why everybody wants to come to America.
[03:11:24.304 --> 03:11:32.730]  Because we are good guys and we have a conscience, but we can be guilted into going along with globalist garbage because we have such a big conscience.
[03:11:32.730 --> 03:11:35.572]  And the final equation is good people.
[03:11:35.572 --> 03:11:40.996]  Every race, color, and creed that are one race, the red-blooded race, to stop being chumps.
[03:11:40.996 --> 03:11:45.559]  Be nice to people that deserve it, but stop rolling over and being pushed around.
[03:11:45.559 --> 03:11:48.141]  This country was founded on not trusting the government.
[03:11:48.141 --> 03:11:50.083]  This country was founded on having small government.
[03:11:50.776 --> 03:11:53.443]  It was founded on not worshipping royalty.
[03:11:53.443 --> 03:11:58.054]  Why are we worshipping Queen Elizabeth and the rest of her inbred moron family?
[03:11:58.054 --> 03:12:00.259]  That is not America, David!
[03:12:01.104 --> 03:12:02.004]  You know, absolutely, Alex.
[03:12:02.004 --> 03:12:09.928]  And when we look at what's going on with the health care situation, Rand Paul said that this is welfare, this is a super fund for the insurance companies.
[03:12:09.928 --> 03:12:12.229]  But you can also see what's happening on the Republican side.
[03:12:12.229 --> 03:12:18.652]  We've got Mitch McConnell handing out massive favors to individual senators to buy their votes.
[03:12:18.652 --> 03:12:27.556]  And it's the center of the Republican Party that is at war with Trump, that is at war with the agenda that GOP voters have voted for every election.
[03:12:27.556 --> 03:12:28.677]  And by the way, they admitted.
[03:12:28.877 --> 03:12:45.092]  Obamacare is meant to get worse and worse, and as it gets worse, the bailouts to the big banks get worse, and your health care gets worse, and then the actuary computers to save it will fully take control of health care now and manage it all, and then unless you're part of the elite, you're not going to get health care anymore.
[03:12:45.092 --> 03:12:46.814]  Welcome to Idiotville!
[03:12:46.814 --> 03:12:51.839]  How many liberals have called or on the street gone, I wish it was like England or Cuba where I get free health care.
[03:12:51.839 --> 03:12:52.519]  Hey Dumbo!
[03:12:53.675 --> 03:12:55.837]  It's horrible health care in those countries, Dumbo!
[03:13:14.910 --> 03:13:19.953]  If they are the single payer, they will have the single decision as to what happens to your health care.
[03:13:19.953 --> 03:13:25.035]  Because we're all in this together as single payer, and you getting too much treatment takes from me!
[03:13:25.035 --> 03:13:28.757]  We have a set some pie, and some nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh!
[03:13:28.757 --> 03:13:31.859]  They're all these, oh my gosh, let's go to phone calls!
[03:13:31.859 --> 03:13:34.300]  Let's go to Debbie in the great state of New Jersey!
[03:13:34.300 --> 03:13:36.281]  You're on the air, come on down!
[03:13:39.206 --> 03:13:40.226]  Debbie?
[03:13:40.226 --> 03:13:40.927]  Debbie?
[03:13:40.927 --> 03:13:45.848]  Let's get ready to rumble!
[03:13:45.848 --> 03:13:46.288]  Are you there, Debbie?
[03:13:46.288 --> 03:13:46.908]  I'm here.
[03:13:46.908 --> 03:13:47.289]  Good, go ahead.
[03:13:47.289 --> 03:13:48.909]  Yes, I'm sorry.
[03:13:48.909 --> 03:14:07.575]  I just wanted to say that the demons in our government are laughing at us every time anybody talks about the Constitution of the United States of our forefathers, because they know full well that we're operating under the Constitution of the Corporation of the United States, and we need to encourage Trump
[03:14:08.809 --> 03:14:22.798]  To abolish the IRS, who is the pitbull for the internal... Yes, in 1913 we got the income tax, we got the Federal Reserve, we got the 17th Amendment to bring our senators from the states elected by the legislature.
[03:14:22.798 --> 03:14:27.421]  The House was generally elected, but the Senate was a creature of the states.
[03:14:27.421 --> 03:14:29.582]  That was when the real balance went out, and you're right.
[03:14:29.582 --> 03:14:34.645]  They declare a civil emergency every year with the Sergeant of Arms, and that's how they ignore everything.
[03:14:34.645 --> 03:14:35.446]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:14:35.988 --> 03:14:39.790]  It's important for people to understand what the Constitution is so they understand that we're not under it.
[03:14:39.790 --> 03:14:44.292]  That's why we point out these discrepancies between what they do and what the Constitution says.
[03:14:44.292 --> 03:14:45.073]  Great point, Debbie.
[03:14:45.073 --> 03:14:46.393]  Anything else?
[03:14:46.393 --> 03:14:48.314]  Yeah, also, they're taxing.
[03:14:48.314 --> 03:14:52.116]  They're not explaining the difference between income and wages.
[03:14:52.116 --> 03:14:56.299]  They're taxing our work wages, so you're getting paid for half an hour's work.
[03:14:56.299 --> 03:14:56.679]  That's right.
[03:14:56.679 --> 03:14:59.520]  They're not even supposed to do that under the Constitution.
[03:14:59.520 --> 03:15:00.821]  That's in the Communist Manifesto.
[03:15:02.005 --> 03:15:02.545]  Right.
[03:15:02.545 --> 03:15:13.394]  So, I'm just saying that if Trump would push more to abolish this criminal entity, that we would gain our sovereignty and learn how to discharge our debt the right way.
[03:15:13.394 --> 03:15:13.874]  Great point, Debbie.
[03:15:13.874 --> 03:15:14.615]  Thank you for holding.
[03:15:14.615 --> 03:15:15.675]  You're awesome.
[03:15:15.675 --> 03:15:17.077]  And, you know, that's the big issue here.
[03:15:17.777 --> 03:15:17.997]  Is that
[03:15:34.025 --> 03:15:37.526]  Millions of conservatives, libertarians, veterans groups, 501c3s.
[03:15:37.526 --> 03:15:40.126]  I mean, they've been a true terrorist organization.
[03:15:40.126 --> 03:15:40.887]  Caught red-handed.
[03:15:40.887 --> 03:15:42.227]  Their abuses continue.
[03:15:42.227 --> 03:15:43.527]  They're unconstitutional.
[03:15:43.527 --> 03:15:47.448]  Trump needs to go after the Internal Revenue Service.
[03:15:47.448 --> 03:15:48.528]  He needs to do it.
[03:15:48.528 --> 03:15:50.149]  They're already trying to bring him down.
[03:15:50.149 --> 03:15:51.309]  Why not go all the way?
[03:15:51.309 --> 03:15:53.409]  Thank you, Debbie.
[03:15:53.409 --> 03:15:55.310]  Let's take another call here.
[03:15:55.310 --> 03:15:59.851]  Let's talk to Mailman in California, from the great state of California.
[03:15:59.851 --> 03:16:01.011]  Mailman, go ahead.
[03:16:03.012 --> 03:16:03.752]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:16:03.752 --> 03:16:06.194]  Yes I can, my friend.
[03:16:06.194 --> 03:16:16.460]  Alright, I'm calling for an opportunity for Infowarriors to give a black eye to Bezos through Amazon and his shady dealings.
[03:16:16.460 --> 03:16:19.381]  Yes, they get $1.48 from every taxpayer on every item they ship.
[03:16:19.381 --> 03:16:22.663]  A little special deal for them.
[03:16:22.663 --> 03:16:29.067]  I want to encourage every Infowarrior out there to look up this article by the Wall Street Journal where it all gets explained.
[03:16:29.067 --> 03:16:31.248]  Google, do a search engine on that.
[03:16:32.035 --> 03:16:38.960]  And USPS, Amazon, and Priority or Special Delivery, I think is what the name of the article was.
[03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:43.144]  Just like, I guess you made over $10 billion on the Obama phone.
[03:16:43.144 --> 03:16:45.585]  Carlos Slim of Mexico!
[03:16:45.585 --> 03:16:51.430]  $10 billion to his fat little wallet, screwing over taxpayers for free phones!
[03:16:51.850 --> 03:16:56.092]  And then he buys the New York Times and shovels anti-American propaganda down our throat!
[03:16:56.092 --> 03:17:03.917]  That's Carlos Slim, who was in Congress last week asking them to censor the new media because it's costing him money!
[03:17:03.917 --> 03:17:06.038]  What an arrogant piece of garbage!
[03:17:06.038 --> 03:17:07.118]  Go ahead, mailman.
[03:17:07.118 --> 03:17:12.121]  Infowarriors out there, if you guys read this, understand it.
[03:17:12.768 --> 03:17:24.872]  Once you know it, and you know that they're breaking up the law, because there's a law from 2006 that says you treat first-class mail a certain way, and these Amazon packages are taking priority over it, and that's against the law.
[03:17:24.872 --> 03:17:27.653]  It is against the law, absolutely, but it's okay.
[03:17:27.653 --> 03:17:29.973]  Bezos is only worth $89 million.
[03:17:29.973 --> 03:17:37.376]  He only wants your guns, wants your family, wants you sterilized, wants world government, gets CIA money, owns the Washington Post.
[03:17:37.376 --> 03:17:38.236]  He's only sworn to
[03:17:38.356 --> 03:17:39.037]  I'm sorry, he's $85.1 billion today.
[03:17:54.549 --> 03:17:56.251]  Ah, good point, Mr. Mailman.
[03:17:56.251 --> 03:17:57.293]  Can I say something here, Alex?
[03:17:57.293 --> 03:17:59.996]  You know, it illustrates the leverage that these guys have.
[03:17:59.996 --> 03:18:03.100]  Because he's got the Washington Post, and that's big leverage that he got.
[03:18:03.100 --> 03:18:04.422]  And he got it for a song.
[03:18:04.422 --> 03:18:13.193]  This guy who got $20 billion increase in net worth just the first five months of this year bought Washington Post for one quarter of a billion dollars.
[03:18:13.453 --> 03:18:19.176]  And then he got CIA $600 million to basically fund his operation.
[03:18:19.176 --> 03:18:23.557]  And then all of us pay him money on every package.
[03:18:23.557 --> 03:18:28.760]  $1.48 and it's illegal because Bezos is a liberal.
[03:18:28.760 --> 03:18:42.986]  Just like Apple owns the most enslaved factories with suicide nets on the roofs and in the stairwells and they force aboard because they're all like little liberal trendy nerd guys so it's okay they own slave
[03:18:43.086 --> 03:18:47.149]  Yeah, and they get this kind of leverage from the... But his name's Bezos!
[03:18:47.149 --> 03:18:48.430]  He's liberal!
[03:18:48.430 --> 03:18:49.371]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:18:49.371 --> 03:18:53.294]  I mean, you look at that little bit of money that he used to get... But it's okay because he's liberal.
[03:18:53.294 --> 03:18:54.815]  But he's liberal and you're not.
[03:18:54.815 --> 03:18:56.636]  He has moral high ground!
[03:18:56.636 --> 03:18:58.277]  Zuckerberg has moral high ground!
[03:18:58.277 --> 03:18:58.958]  That's right.
[03:18:58.958 --> 03:19:05.082]  Zuckerberg helps Muslims round up people that criticize Allah and who are executed, and he helps them get executed.
[03:19:05.082 --> 03:19:08.245]  I like Facebook!
[03:19:08.245 --> 03:19:09.646]  Say, thank you Zuckerberg!
[03:19:11.803 --> 03:19:12.723]  No, that's okay.
[03:19:12.723 --> 03:19:14.004]  You don't want to worship him?
[03:19:14.004 --> 03:19:15.084]  Look at him laughing!
[03:19:15.084 --> 03:19:16.484]  I'm liberal!
[03:19:16.484 --> 03:19:20.345]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:19:20.345 --> 03:19:22.066]  Okay, thank you Metal Man.
[03:19:22.066 --> 03:19:26.687]  Let's talk to... Let's talk to Eric!
[03:19:26.687 --> 03:19:28.827]  Eric in Wisconsin, come on down!
[03:19:28.827 --> 03:19:32.328]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:19:32.328 --> 03:19:36.730]  Well, I'm... I'm in a pretty good mood today.
[03:19:36.730 --> 03:19:37.750]  Well, that's always a good thing.
[03:19:39.255 --> 03:19:46.202]  So, um, the other day I was sailing out talking to my wife and it really dawned on me because I study history too.
[03:19:46.202 --> 03:19:48.384]  And you thought about Zuckerberg looks like a vampire?
[03:19:48.384 --> 03:19:51.748]  I'm sorry.
[03:19:51.748 --> 03:19:54.170]  Well he kind of does actually now that you mention it.
[03:19:54.170 --> 03:20:00.897]  Um, well basically they are really taking everything from the ancient gods and redoing it to us.
[03:20:02.214 --> 03:20:09.478]  Yes, everything you read about in mythology, from human-animal crosses to elites, you know, living on armored mountaintops, it's all happening again.
[03:20:09.478 --> 03:20:10.079]  Yes.
[03:20:10.079 --> 03:20:11.740]  Almost like it happened before.
[03:20:11.740 --> 03:20:14.021]  We just had Macron become Jupiter.
[03:20:14.021 --> 03:20:16.262]  He said, I am the god Jupiter.
[03:20:16.262 --> 03:20:16.883]  I rule.
[03:20:16.883 --> 03:20:19.084]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:20:19.084 --> 03:20:22.826]  Yeah, so basically, when I told my wife that, she kind of looked at me cross-eyed.
[03:20:22.826 --> 03:20:24.747]  I said, think about it.
[03:20:24.747 --> 03:20:29.410]  They think that it's their right to meddle in our lives for absolutely no reason.
[03:20:31.264 --> 03:20:34.826]  I just, it's amazing sometimes, and most people don't see it.
[03:20:34.826 --> 03:20:42.350]  Well, you have to understand, with these sociopaths, psychopaths, and others, they love to throw it in your face, and as they get more power, they get more reckless.
[03:20:42.350 --> 03:20:44.392]  They're crying out for help.
[03:20:44.392 --> 03:20:50.975]  Not their psychopathic cerebral cortex, but the overall humanity that's still in them wants to kill them.
[03:20:50.975 --> 03:20:56.399]  And so they, that's why they always lead us to wars and death, and then if nobody will take them out, you know, they usually commit suicide.
[03:20:57.279 --> 03:21:00.942]  Because they just want to kill everybody because they want to kill themselves.
[03:21:00.942 --> 03:21:05.165]  But they sit up there and say, I am the great and powerful Oz!
[03:21:05.165 --> 03:21:07.426]  I am invincible!
[03:21:07.426 --> 03:21:17.693]  But when the little dog pulls back the curtain, well then you see that it's the little man back there who's been scared all along.
[03:21:17.693 --> 03:21:18.534]  Exactly.
[03:21:18.534 --> 03:21:25.199]  And then I have one other thing too because I have been a listener to you the last few years and
[03:21:26.332 --> 03:21:29.255]  I used to tell people, you know, get off the fence, do something.
[03:21:29.255 --> 03:21:31.798]  I actually did, because I am a patriot.
[03:21:31.798 --> 03:21:40.487]  So I started a social media website based on freedom of speech, since everyone wants to seem to take it away from us.
[03:21:40.487 --> 03:21:43.811]  So it's called voiceanything.com.
[03:21:43.811 --> 03:21:46.774]  I basically combined... Your phone broke up when you said the name of the website.
[03:21:46.774 --> 03:21:48.155]  It broke up when you said the name of the website.
[03:21:48.155 --> 03:21:48.596]  What was it?
[03:21:50.251 --> 03:21:52.051]  VoiceAnything.com.
[03:21:52.051 --> 03:21:52.692]  That's a great name.
[03:21:52.692 --> 03:21:53.632]  VoiceAnything.com.
[03:21:53.632 --> 03:21:54.412]  Thank you so much.
[03:21:54.412 --> 03:21:55.592]  I'll check it out.
[03:21:55.592 --> 03:22:07.095]  And again, folks, it's important when you leave Facebook in places, or create your own website, or have a website you're on, then use Facebook to draw people into the free open web.
[03:22:07.095 --> 03:22:14.276]  It's the fake corporate cable on the internet system that they admit they want to dominate and control everybody with.
[03:22:14.276 --> 03:22:17.237]  So what you do is you use them to then push to your new platform.
[03:22:18.766 --> 03:22:21.288]  Get him out of the ghetto as Director Calder.
[03:22:21.288 --> 03:22:22.889]  Let me ask you this question, we're going to go to Craig.
[03:22:22.889 --> 03:22:25.652]  What do you, I mean, we know it's a big pharma wanting to make money.
[03:22:25.652 --> 03:22:31.797]  And we know they criticize us showing, you know, high quality known supplements that people need, like vitamin mineral mixes and amino acids.
[03:22:31.797 --> 03:22:33.098]  I mean, oh my gosh, how evil.
[03:22:33.098 --> 03:22:35.059]  You know, higher absorption rate.
[03:22:35.059 --> 03:22:37.501]  Oh, we're selling coal, silver, coffee, or shampoo, how evil.
[03:22:37.501 --> 03:22:40.864]  Or fluoride-free toothpaste, how kooky.
[03:22:40.864 --> 03:22:42.806]  But, they admit opioid
[03:22:43.871 --> 03:22:54.442]  Prescriptions have gone up 100% the last year and I was reading on the last five years it's like 300% and suddenly I know a lot of people who I've been friends with who are just out of my life.
[03:22:55.441 --> 03:23:01.806]  Because they're on opioids and are just, they live and watch TV now and basically take opiates.
[03:23:01.806 --> 03:23:04.028]  I mean, it is just everywhere.
[03:23:04.028 --> 03:23:06.831]  And it's, thank God, the few times I've taken, I'm allergic to them.
[03:23:06.831 --> 03:23:09.013]  You know, I had compound fracture and stuff.
[03:23:09.013 --> 03:23:11.495]  You know, shoot me up with morphine.
[03:23:11.495 --> 03:23:14.237]  I started vomiting everywhere for five hours.
[03:23:14.237 --> 03:23:22.004]  I just don't, I mean, clearly they did it on purpose, but who green-lighted, let's just flood opium everywhere and opioid derivatives.
[03:23:22.304 --> 03:23:27.546]  Maybe it was Petraeus and the CIA when they were in Afghanistan, you know, because that's what basically happened in Afghanistan.
[03:23:27.546 --> 03:23:30.748]  We went there, you saw the opium production.
[03:23:30.748 --> 03:23:35.390]  Sky went from 7% in 2001 to 93% of global production by 2015.
[03:23:35.390 --> 03:23:36.430]  That's right.
[03:23:36.430 --> 03:23:38.151]  Record crops every year.
[03:23:38.151 --> 03:23:39.212]  So what are they going to do with that?
[03:23:39.212 --> 03:23:42.093]  Well, they need to get some money for that crop that they're raising.
[03:23:42.093 --> 03:23:46.055]  So it's probably something like the crack cocaine epidemic we saw, Alex.
[03:23:46.055 --> 03:23:48.496]  I wouldn't be surprised if we got some reporter
[03:23:49.016 --> 03:23:55.642]  Who uncovers this at some point in time and finds out that that's exactly what's behind this opioid epidemic.
[03:23:55.642 --> 03:24:00.666]  And then that reporter winds up getting killed, just like we had with Dark Alliance and Gary Webb.
[03:24:00.666 --> 03:24:07.892]  And I love how mainstream media acts like they're exposing all this now, and they're the ones that make the money.
[03:24:07.892 --> 03:24:09.233]  And take Webb.
[03:24:09.233 --> 03:24:17.040]  He was coming on my show in a month when his new book was about to get published and come out, proving all the awards he got were accurate and that there was CIA drug dealing.
[03:24:18.004 --> 03:24:22.088]  And then now they make movies like Sakaro that's based on a composite of true stories.
[03:24:22.088 --> 03:24:23.009]  Now that's been confirmed.
[03:24:23.009 --> 03:24:26.913]  I don't know some of the folks who were actually involved in it, but I'll just leave it at that.
[03:24:26.913 --> 03:24:30.496]  And that was them consolidating three cartels down to one, basically.
[03:24:30.496 --> 03:24:34.040]  And it's admitted that elements of our government bring in the main narcotics.
[03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:38.504]  It happened in Vietnam, but they again act like it's kooky and weird to be learned.
[03:24:38.504 --> 03:24:42.007]  What they do is they take the general public that's not informed and they go, don't be insecure.
[03:24:43.223 --> 03:24:48.966]  Call someone informed a conspiracy theorist and feel good about laughing at knowledge.
[03:24:48.966 --> 03:24:51.167]  And that's what the modern liberalism is.
[03:24:51.167 --> 03:24:58.050]  Any investigation of what they're doing, any contradiction of their official story is immediately pushed out there as a conspiracy theory.
[03:24:58.050 --> 03:25:01.212]  And Gary Webb was initially, when he put out his investigation, it was excellent.
[03:25:01.212 --> 03:25:02.012]  He won awards.
[03:25:02.012 --> 03:25:06.774]  And then the establishment organized a concerted effort to take him down.
[03:25:06.774 --> 03:25:08.375]  The LA Times and others, they had...
[03:25:08.715 --> 03:25:11.376]  The CIA was involved, that's been declassified.
[03:25:11.376 --> 03:25:12.057]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:25:12.057 --> 03:25:13.738]  The LA Times editor was CIA.
[03:25:13.738 --> 03:25:15.378]  Which is what they're doing now to Trump.
[03:25:15.378 --> 03:25:25.524]  I call it the election espionage, you know, because it's basically the spy services as well as the political establishment, the media establishment that are organized to take Trump down.
[03:25:25.524 --> 03:25:28.665]  And they don't care what is true and what isn't true.
[03:25:28.665 --> 03:25:35.529]  They're going to keep repeating these lies because that's a tactic of propaganda to destroy his reputation so that they can come after him, destroy his presidency.
[03:25:36.589 --> 03:25:39.892]  Slow down his ability to get some of his agenda through.
[03:25:39.892 --> 03:25:49.340]  That's a key part of what's happened is the fact that they're on defense and they keep coming up with... Remember when they derail it successfully, they haven't derailed at all.
[03:25:49.340 --> 03:25:50.301]  It's their fault.
[03:25:50.301 --> 03:25:51.241]  They're behind it.
[03:25:51.241 --> 03:25:52.823]  We're winning by fighting.
[03:25:52.823 --> 03:25:54.084]  Think how far we've already come.
[03:25:54.084 --> 03:25:56.326]  Globalism is collapsing.
[03:25:56.326 --> 03:25:57.266]  They're in crisis.
[03:25:57.266 --> 03:25:59.468]  We are having devastating victories.
[03:25:59.468 --> 03:26:04.472]  It doesn't mean they may not kill Trump or myself or others, but together we're going over the top.
[03:26:04.472 --> 03:26:04.973]  We're winning.
[03:26:05.353 --> 03:26:07.334]  Craig in New Mexico on the opioids.
[03:26:07.334 --> 03:26:09.916]  Give us your take.
[03:26:09.916 --> 03:26:10.836]  Hi Alex.
[03:26:10.836 --> 03:26:16.840]  You know I'm calling for the people that actually need the opioids that can't get them.
[03:26:16.840 --> 03:26:23.984]  And there's a lot of us out here and we are being called drug addicts and we are not.
[03:26:23.984 --> 03:26:25.324]  Well that's another paradigm.
[03:26:25.324 --> 03:26:27.846]  They let you get on them and then they try to take them away from you.
[03:26:28.390 --> 03:26:31.792]  Well, the other thing, too, is what they're doing with medical marijuana.
[03:26:31.792 --> 03:26:35.215]  That's helpful for some people to get off of the more dangerous prescription opioids.
[03:26:35.215 --> 03:26:35.735]  But they won't let you.
[03:26:35.735 --> 03:26:37.737]  Sorry, go ahead, Collar.
[03:26:37.737 --> 03:26:41.499]  They will not give the opioids to the people that need them.
[03:26:41.499 --> 03:26:44.942]  And also, on the other hand, they won't give surgery.
[03:26:44.942 --> 03:26:52.808]  I need laser surgery, which they have made me unable to get by $15,000 copay.
[03:26:52.808 --> 03:26:57.511]  And all the doctors in my area that give out the opioids have been taken out.
[03:26:58.613 --> 03:27:05.598]  And it's ridiculous for the people... I had a friend of mine's son call me trying to get pills off me.
[03:27:05.598 --> 03:27:14.144]  And I almost lost my friend because I told him because of people like him, people like me that actually need the drugs cannot get them anymore.
[03:27:14.144 --> 03:27:15.365]  You're talking about palliative care?
[03:27:15.365 --> 03:27:17.326]  I am so tired of being called a drug addict!
[03:27:18.539 --> 03:27:21.561]  Nobody addresses the other end of the spectrum.
[03:27:21.561 --> 03:27:23.043]  Those of us who need them.
[03:27:37.395 --> 03:27:44.658]  Well, part of the drug war is that they have come down on doctors who would prescribe painkillers for people who were suffering from cancer.
[03:27:44.658 --> 03:27:46.739]  Hey, my dad was happy to retire from dentistry.
[03:27:46.739 --> 03:27:49.660]  He only does it, he has his license, but just for the family.
[03:27:49.660 --> 03:27:57.283]  Because they would just give people painkillers for wisdom teeth that were pulled out, and then the state police would show up and go through all their records.
[03:27:57.283 --> 03:27:57.643]  Yeah.
[03:27:57.643 --> 03:27:59.103]  And they were pretty good.
[03:27:59.103 --> 03:28:00.604]  Now the feds completely run it.
[03:28:01.064 --> 03:28:03.845]  And my dad says, look, they've just made health care where it's just impossible.
[03:28:03.845 --> 03:28:04.306]  Yeah.
[03:28:04.306 --> 03:28:07.527]  I mean, because they're wrecking it, folks, because they're just, you know, no more eye surgery.
[03:28:07.527 --> 03:28:10.509]  Here's your cane, you know, and no more knee surgery.
[03:28:10.509 --> 03:28:11.970]  Here's your cane.
[03:28:11.970 --> 03:28:12.630]  Thank you, Craig.
[03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:13.730]  Sorry to hear you're having those problems.
[03:28:13.730 --> 03:28:14.171]  Yes, I know.
[03:28:14.171 --> 03:28:15.631]  I've talked to doctors.
[03:28:15.631 --> 03:28:16.472]  There is the whole end.
[03:28:18.007 --> 03:28:21.811]  What they're doing is, doctors that were giving it to real people that needed it are gone.
[03:28:21.811 --> 03:28:27.055]  It's only if you follow the computer and the HMO when it tells you.
[03:28:27.055 --> 03:28:29.217]  It's when you prescribe it separate.
[03:28:29.217 --> 03:28:30.699]  See, it's all computer.
[03:28:30.699 --> 03:28:32.981]  It's all computerized now, folks.
[03:28:32.981 --> 03:28:35.123]  My dad managed over 100 dental offices, believe me, I know.
[03:28:35.603 --> 03:28:37.744]  Centralized control of health care is what it really is.
[03:28:37.744 --> 03:28:41.586]  Yeah, as long as you follow what the computer says, you're covered because the computer said it.
[03:28:41.586 --> 03:28:45.168]  See, the doctors didn't want to only follow what it says.
[03:28:45.168 --> 03:28:48.670]  And it's all actuaries done by bioethicists and algorithms.
[03:28:48.670 --> 03:28:50.351]  Remember the headline last year?
[03:28:50.351 --> 03:28:52.332]  IBM decides when troops get care?
[03:28:52.332 --> 03:28:57.195]  They go, oh, we weren't doing death panels at these VA bases.
[03:28:57.195 --> 03:28:58.576]  It was the computer decided.
[03:28:59.178 --> 03:29:00.379]  So the computer is going to be your death metal.
[03:29:00.379 --> 03:29:04.862]  Just like in Nazi Germany it was an IBM computer that decided how long you lived.
[03:29:04.862 --> 03:29:10.786]  Gus in the great state of Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:29:10.786 --> 03:29:13.308]  I'm just calling in today to sound the alarm.
[03:29:14.272 --> 03:29:24.598]  You know, the last couple months with the release of the Puerto Rican nationalist guy that was at the front of the Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York, there's been a lot of articles about the island of Puerto Rico.
[03:29:24.598 --> 03:29:34.263]  Now, I'm an American of Hispanic descent living down here in the Sunshine State, and I can tell you just from what I've seen in the last few years, we've been flooded with people from the island of Puerto Rico.
[03:29:34.263 --> 03:29:36.304]  Well, according to a lot of people... Hold on, I'm gonna come back to you.
[03:29:36.304 --> 03:29:39.746]  I mean, David's got a whole show prepared, and I apologize, but soon he'll have more air time than he ever wants.
[03:29:40.106 --> 03:29:47.109]  We're going to come back and finish up with you, because I want to hear this, because yeah, it's going under, it's bankrupt just like we are if we don't have this recovery.
[03:29:47.109 --> 03:29:51.671]  And so I want to hear your take on that, because that's the thing, if Trump isn't successful, I mean, it's going to be a depression.
[03:29:51.671 --> 03:29:53.191]  We'll be back with David Knight.
[03:29:53.191 --> 03:29:54.572]  We're on the march.
[03:29:54.572 --> 03:29:56.212]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.212 --> 03:29:59.774]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:04.369 --> 03:30:08.452]  We must keep the Internet free from communistic government restrictions and parameters.
[03:30:08.452 --> 03:30:09.053]  Why?
[03:30:09.053 --> 03:30:11.494]  Because it would stop memes and erase heroes.
[03:30:11.494 --> 03:30:12.395]  Don't believe me?
[03:30:12.395 --> 03:30:13.336]  Look at China.
[03:30:13.336 --> 03:30:21.161]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously memed with Barack Obama in 2013, when a picture of the two was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, too.
[03:30:21.161 --> 03:30:27.046]  This happened again after an awkward handshake with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Eeyore.
[03:30:27.486 --> 03:30:32.173]  Other images, such as Winnie the Pooh in a car, have been memed alongside President Xi in his limo.
[03:30:32.173 --> 03:30:37.340]  But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular, China has now censored it from the Internet.
[03:30:37.340 --> 03:30:43.288]  This is commonplace in Communist China, as a recently deceased political dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo,
[03:30:43.869 --> 03:30:46.671]  has had his name completely censored from the virtual world.
[03:30:46.671 --> 03:30:51.093]  Try sending his name in a message to a friend, and the message will disappear into cyberspace.
[03:30:51.093 --> 03:30:55.276]  Xiaobo died in Chinese custody, and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[03:30:55.276 --> 03:30:56.837]  Keep the internet free in America.
[03:30:56.837 --> 03:30:58.058]  Stop net neutrality.
[03:30:58.058 --> 03:30:59.399]  Save meme magic.
[03:30:59.399 --> 03:31:01.540]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroeder.
[03:31:03.911 --> 03:31:12.996]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:31:12.996 --> 03:31:21.120]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:21.400 --> 03:31:26.263]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:26.263 --> 03:31:33.066]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:33.066 --> 03:31:40.250]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:40.250 --> 03:31:47.093]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:47.253 --> 03:31:51.735]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:51.735 --> 03:31:55.136]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:55.136 --> 03:32:01.438]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:32:01.438 --> 03:32:03.339]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[03:32:05.086 --> 03:32:10.573]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:32:10.573 --> 03:32:11.415]  I take this.
[03:32:11.415 --> 03:32:12.556]  My family takes this.
[03:32:12.556 --> 03:32:16.842]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:32:16.842 --> 03:32:21.048]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:32:21.428 --> 03:32:26.071]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:32:26.071 --> 03:32:27.191]  I don't feel good.
[03:32:27.191 --> 03:32:30.953]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:32:30.953 --> 03:32:33.635]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:32:33.635 --> 03:32:39.438]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:32:39.438 --> 03:32:42.420]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:32:42.420 --> 03:32:45.942]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:32:45.942 --> 03:32:48.183]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:32:48.183 --> 03:32:48.543]  I love it.
[03:32:48.703 --> 03:32:51.487]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:32:51.487 --> 03:32:52.508]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:32:52.508 --> 03:32:58.175]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:32:58.175 --> 03:33:00.338]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:33:00.338 --> 03:33:02.541]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:33:15.703 --> 03:33:21.266]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:33:21.266 --> 03:33:36.913]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.913 --> 03:33:41.676]  Well, set aside the alienation.
[03:33:41.676 --> 03:33:43.957]  Get on with the fascination.
[03:33:45.303 --> 03:33:46.728]  Alright, David Knight's taking over.
[03:33:46.728 --> 03:33:48.835]  I wanted to finish up with Gus, just briefly.
[03:33:48.835 --> 03:33:51.104]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[03:33:52.248 --> 03:33:58.130]  I have said that we're going to have a super summer sale that would go throughout the month of July.
[03:33:58.130 --> 03:34:08.733]  The problem is, we're running out of the Brain Force Plus Nootropic, we're running out of Super Mel Vitality, Survival Shield X2, and some of the other best-selling products.
[03:34:08.733 --> 03:34:19.577]  So I'm going to continue free shipping throughout the month of July, but the next few days, I'm going to have to end the 30% off on Brain Force Plus, the amazing Nootropic, now with 20% more in each bottle.
[03:34:21.158 --> 03:34:26.962]  The 30% off on Super Metal Vitality, the Survival Shield X2, I just have to do it.
[03:34:26.962 --> 03:34:36.588]  I'll continue the sale on Secret 12, DNA Force is back in stock, the Myco ZX, amazing anti-fungal yeast candida in the gut and the intestines, that's back.
[03:34:36.588 --> 03:34:43.692]  I'm going to have to end the 30% off though because we're running low on Biome Defense, that again is 30% off when you get it with the Myco ZX.
[03:34:43.692 --> 03:34:48.335]  So, you support the broadcast and you fund Info Wars, that is in the
[03:34:49.989 --> 03:34:56.532]  Eye of the storm right now, but help us not just continue, but hopefully expand in the face of the globalists.
[03:34:56.532 --> 03:35:05.315]  So, never a better time to take advantage of these great prices of the free shipping and to support the broadcast, but only a couple days more.
[03:35:05.315 --> 03:35:10.317]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:35:10.317 --> 03:35:14.198]  I'll make good on the specials going throughout the month with the free shipping.
[03:35:14.198 --> 03:35:17.700]  We'll add some of the other items that aren't selling out or have come back into stock
[03:35:18.340 --> 03:35:20.662]  at 25, 30, or even 40% off.
[03:35:20.662 --> 03:35:31.429]  But our best-selling products, Brain Force, Supermail, Survival Shield X2, and My Own Defense, we've got to stop those 30% offs here in the next 48 hours or so.
[03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:34.931]  So take advantage of those again at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:35:34.931 --> 03:35:35.712]  And again, for myself,
[03:35:36.332 --> 03:35:36.532]  Yes.
[03:35:54.984 --> 03:36:08.833]  We would be in dire straits right now, this country and this world, if we weren't seeing this nationalist awakening globally that isn't perfect, but is instinctive in the right direction and is sending shockwaves across the world.
[03:36:08.833 --> 03:36:11.335]  David, what would you call this time we're in today?
[03:36:12.338 --> 03:36:15.000]  Well, it's really a real crisis, isn't it?
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:18.343]  I mean, we've got danger and opportunity right at the same time.
[03:36:18.343 --> 03:36:19.504]  And this could go either way.
[03:36:19.504 --> 03:36:21.685]  That's why it's so important for us to get behind Trump.
[03:36:21.685 --> 03:36:23.767]  And it's important for Trump to get behind his agenda.
[03:36:23.767 --> 03:36:27.150]  We've had an article last week where I was talking about that.
[03:36:27.150 --> 03:36:28.991]  It was actually coming out of the Washington Post.
[03:36:28.991 --> 03:36:31.053]  I said, for the first time, I agree with Washington Post.
[03:36:31.553 --> 03:36:44.755]  He has these massive rallies, he's incredibly popular, and if you could pull people together and get them to hammer these establishment Republicans who don't care anything about our freedoms except for the next election.
[03:36:44.755 --> 03:36:48.576]  That's why these people are saying, we're not going to do anything that's going to really change Obamacare.
[03:36:48.576 --> 03:36:51.996]  We're going to kind of keep this here, we're going to play it safe because we want to get re-elected.
[03:36:51.996 --> 03:36:57.857]  Well, you let them know that they're not going to get re-elected if they don't do what we voted for for four elections.
[03:36:57.857 --> 03:37:00.638]  You've got to make it clear that that's not going to happen if they don't
[03:37:01.458 --> 03:37:02.399]  That's right.
[03:37:02.399 --> 03:37:04.300]  They're never going to compromise.
[03:37:04.300 --> 03:37:07.543]  He's got to rally the troops to remove the establishment Republicans, to remove the Democrats.
[03:37:07.543 --> 03:37:08.023]  They are a cancer
[03:37:27.837 --> 03:37:32.081]  All they want is their job and you told them you're not going to have your job if you don't stand with what we voted for.
[03:37:32.081 --> 03:37:38.406]  And I want to go to Gus and then have you take over because in your stack today was Puerto Rico and in your stack was Illinois.
[03:37:38.406 --> 03:37:40.828]  We're not taking pleasure that Puerto Rico's going under.
[03:37:40.828 --> 03:37:44.091]  We're not taking pleasure in Illinois in deep trouble under globalist management.
[03:37:44.091 --> 03:37:45.633]  A lot of great people in that state.
[03:37:45.633 --> 03:37:46.713]  It's coming everywhere.
[03:37:46.713 --> 03:37:48.395]  You think California's bad?
[03:37:48.395 --> 03:37:48.835]  Everywhere.
[03:37:49.816 --> 03:37:55.518]  is infected by this and when it starts falling it's going to be like it's going to be like dominoes.
[03:37:55.518 --> 03:37:59.259]  So Gus was bringing up what's going on in Puerto Rico.
[03:37:59.259 --> 03:38:01.020]  Go ahead, Gus.
[03:38:01.020 --> 03:38:05.642]  Well, yeah, you know, they're being crushed with one hundred and twenty two billion dollars in debt.
[03:38:05.642 --> 03:38:10.563]  And, you know, Puerto Rico historically votes 80 plus percent Democrat.
[03:38:10.563 --> 03:38:18.326]  A lot of people may not know this, but even though they're not a state, Puerto Ricans, when they're born, they're basically citizens and they come and go as they wish without a green card.
[03:38:18.866 --> 03:38:18.946]  Okay.
[03:38:49.262 --> 03:38:55.869]  We're not going to get Republican votes from these guys, and they're anti-Trump pretty much across the board.
[03:38:55.869 --> 03:39:02.795]  Why is it the Cubans that have been under communism go 90% Republican?
[03:39:02.795 --> 03:39:05.578]  Not that the Republicans are perfect, but it's better than pure communism.
[03:39:05.578 --> 03:39:08.941]  Why don't the Puerto Ricans or the Venezuelans or anybody get?
[03:39:08.941 --> 03:39:10.623]  Socialism doesn't work!
[03:39:10.623 --> 03:39:11.424]  It's a nightmare!
[03:39:12.938 --> 03:39:17.423]  Well, the problem, the thing with Cubans is now you can look at them two different ways.
[03:39:17.423 --> 03:39:19.885]  You're pre-Mariel boatlift Cuban.
[03:39:19.885 --> 03:39:21.387]  You know, they're very capitalist.
[03:39:21.387 --> 03:39:26.251]  And a lot of them, the reason they vote Republican is because they hate Kennedy for bailing on the Bay of Pigs.
[03:39:26.251 --> 03:39:30.396]  But you're post-Mariel Cuban is more likely born and raised under socialism.
[03:39:30.896 --> 03:39:31.897]  No, I understand.
[03:39:31.897 --> 03:39:36.561]  I just don't get how you leave communism or socialism and then you come somewhere else and then try to recreate it.
[03:39:36.561 --> 03:39:37.803]  It's like Californians
[03:39:54.358 --> 03:39:55.659]  Yeah, or New Yorkers.
[03:39:55.659 --> 03:39:57.901]  Yeah, they come here and then they want to do what they did there.
[03:39:57.901 --> 03:40:02.524]  And I'm like, listen, stay there if you want to have state income taxes.
[03:40:02.524 --> 03:40:05.847]  I mean, Texas already has high taxes just compared to California.
[03:40:05.847 --> 03:40:06.747]  They're low.
[03:40:06.747 --> 03:40:08.368]  I mean, I pay so many taxes.
[03:40:08.368 --> 03:40:11.331]  They don't understand why the area that they're coming from is collapsing.
[03:40:11.331 --> 03:40:11.991]  That's the key thing.
[03:40:11.991 --> 03:40:17.916]  They don't understand in New York or Michigan or in California why those areas are collapsing.
[03:40:17.916 --> 03:40:18.456]  They've come back
[03:40:18.536 --> 03:40:24.646]  I've been out before, like, hiking, and somebody will just throw a beer can down, and I'm not some huge environmentalist, but I don't want to see beer cans everywhere, and I'm like...
[03:40:26.147 --> 03:40:28.448]  Dude, you need to pick your beer can up.
[03:40:28.448 --> 03:40:30.128]  Oh, somebody else will do it.
[03:40:30.128 --> 03:40:31.188]  And it's like, you know what?
[03:40:31.188 --> 03:40:34.650]  I don't like when I'm in a river stepping on a beer can or a bottle, cut my foot open.
[03:40:34.650 --> 03:40:36.530]  I go, pick your beer can up.
[03:40:36.530 --> 03:40:37.730]  And it's the same thing.
[03:40:37.730 --> 03:40:40.971]  I use the allegory of peeing in the pool.
[03:40:40.971 --> 03:40:41.832]  People will do it.
[03:40:41.832 --> 03:40:43.712]  Don't think everybody else is doing it.
[03:40:43.712 --> 03:40:45.253]  Like, it's weird.
[03:40:45.253 --> 03:40:49.794]  I guess when I was like a kid that I'd get up and go to the bathroom at the pool, everybody else was just peeing in it.
[03:40:50.114 --> 03:40:54.260]  And I guess that's really, it's like, I don't get in the fast lane and drive slow.
[03:40:54.260 --> 03:40:55.722]  I get out of the fast lane.
[03:40:55.722 --> 03:40:58.846]  The public's so dumb, especially people with Democrat stickers.
[03:40:58.846 --> 03:41:04.594]  It's usually Democrats, you know, coexist stickers, whatever, that are in the fast lane going under the speed limit.
[03:41:04.594 --> 03:41:07.018]  They don't even know their obstructionist, David.
[03:41:07.398 --> 03:41:12.863]  Yeah, well, you know, when you look at the situation in terms of taxes, they think somebody else is going to pay for this.
[03:41:12.863 --> 03:41:16.766]  They think somebody, just like your analogy, they think somebody else is going to pick up the can.
[03:41:16.766 --> 03:41:22.471]  Well, they're happy to kick this can down the road because they believe that it's going to be somebody else who's taxed and not them.
[03:41:22.471 --> 03:41:27.015]  And that's the key delusion that they operate under in these areas under Democrat control.
[03:41:27.015 --> 03:41:31.058]  They're always told they're going to get something from government, but it's never going to cost them anything.
[03:41:31.158 --> 03:41:32.359]  That's the core mentality.
[03:41:32.359 --> 03:41:36.483]  And they're throwing cigarette butts and tin cans and baby diapers all over the trail.
[03:41:36.483 --> 03:41:37.084]  Yeah.
[03:41:37.084 --> 03:41:40.007]  And they don't even understand it's messing the trail up for them.
[03:41:40.007 --> 03:41:41.768]  They think they're getting ahead.
[03:41:41.768 --> 03:41:44.071]  And that's the dirtball equation.
[03:41:44.071 --> 03:41:46.173]  And, I mean, I want to start a national movement.
[03:41:46.173 --> 03:41:50.777]  I want $5,000 fines when you're in the fast lane driving below the speed limit.
[03:41:50.777 --> 03:41:54.561]  I mean, I'm not a road rager, but I do when somebody's going 45 in a 60.
[03:41:54.561 --> 03:41:54.681]  Yeah.
[03:41:55.982 --> 03:41:58.905]  I mean, I do drive up beside him and I go, that's the fast lane!
[03:41:58.905 --> 03:42:00.987]  I go, fast lane!
[03:42:00.987 --> 03:42:03.669]  You get out of it, it's the passing lane!
[03:42:03.669 --> 03:42:06.031]  You know, go back to driver safety!
[03:42:06.031 --> 03:42:07.072]  Gus, thank you for the call.
[03:42:07.072 --> 03:42:08.253]  David, take over.
[03:42:08.253 --> 03:42:10.896]  Thanks for letting me take over 42 minutes of the transmission.
[03:42:10.896 --> 03:42:13.878]  I know you've got a full plate there, so we really appreciate you.
[03:42:13.878 --> 03:42:14.799]  Sure, yeah.
[03:42:14.799 --> 03:42:16.501]  Nightly News coming up tonight, 7 o'clock as well.
[03:42:16.681 --> 03:42:17.401]  Keep going, David.
[03:42:17.401 --> 03:42:17.862]  Thanks.
[03:42:17.862 --> 03:42:21.284]  And August 21st, new show in the morning, 8 to 11.
[03:42:21.284 --> 03:42:23.385]  It's going to be an early morning show, so tune in.
[03:42:23.385 --> 03:42:27.028]  We're going to have a lot of breaking news as it happens at sunrise.
[03:42:27.028 --> 03:42:30.790]  It's going to be starting at 0 dark 30 for me and others who are coming in here.
[03:42:30.790 --> 03:42:40.437]  I want to talk about this Haitian official, because I think this is interesting in light of the fact we just had another GOP operative who was found committed suicide.
[03:42:40.437 --> 03:42:42.218]  There's no political killings.
[03:42:42.218 --> 03:42:43.659]  Lincoln died of natural causes.
[03:42:43.659 --> 03:42:44.360]  So did Kennedy.
[03:42:44.360 --> 03:42:44.860]  That's right.
[03:42:44.860 --> 03:42:45.240]  That's right.
[03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:45.760]  Lead poisoning.
[03:42:46.721 --> 03:43:03.426]  In this case that we talked about on Friday, this guy's name was Peter Smith, and he was found with a bag around his head and helium attached to it, and he had written a suicide note saying, no foul play whatsoever, I did this because I've got an expiring life insurance policy of five million dollars.
[03:43:03.426 --> 03:43:06.067]  Now, that right there should tell you that something is wrong.
[03:43:06.767 --> 03:43:08.489]  Terry Webb wrote one of those letters.
[03:43:08.489 --> 03:43:11.051]  Not before he shot himself twice in the head with a shotgun.
[03:43:11.051 --> 03:43:12.232]  Yeah, no foul play here.
[03:43:12.232 --> 03:43:12.973]  Don't worry about this.
[03:43:12.973 --> 03:43:15.275]  Nobody writes that in a suicide note.
[03:43:15.275 --> 03:43:18.958]  And the very fact that he says, I'm doing this because I want to collect insurance.
[03:43:18.958 --> 03:43:21.420]  Well, you're not going to collect insurance on a suicide.
[03:43:21.420 --> 03:43:23.923]  I don't know who's got a policy that pays on suicides.
[03:43:23.923 --> 03:43:30.649]  But now we have a Haitian official who was supposed to testify on Tuesday talking about the corruption in Haiti.
[03:43:31.149 --> 03:43:37.951]  He has now been found dead by gunshot wound that has been reported, registered as a suicide by the government.
[03:43:37.951 --> 03:43:41.452]  They say this man's name was Eberwine, Klaus Eberwine.
[03:43:41.452 --> 03:43:48.935]  He was a former Haitian government official who is expected to expose the extent of Clinton's foundation corruption and malpractice.
[03:43:48.935 --> 03:43:49.915]  He was going to do it next week.
[03:43:49.915 --> 03:43:53.096]  He was found dead in Miami at the age of 50 with a gunshot wound.
[03:43:54.157 --> 03:44:00.844]  Not long before his death, he acknowledged that his life was in danger because he was going to expose corruption in the Clinton Foundation.
[03:44:00.844 --> 03:44:02.425]  How many times have we heard this before?
[03:44:02.425 --> 03:44:09.072]  We had the DC Madam come on with Alex Jones and saying, and Alex said, you're not thinking about committing suicide.
[03:44:09.072 --> 03:44:09.953]  Absolutely not.
[03:44:09.953 --> 03:44:10.613]  I'm not going to do this.
[03:44:10.613 --> 03:44:11.774]  We had Aaron Schwartz.
[03:44:12.335 --> 03:44:23.828]  Who is taking on the NSA and the Intelligence Surveillance Establishment, fighting them over SOPA, CISPA, and ACTA, PIPA, all these different variants that they had come up with.
[03:44:23.828 --> 03:44:25.210]  He had defeated them multiple times.
[03:44:25.210 --> 03:44:27.092]  This guy was a fighter.
[03:44:27.092 --> 03:44:28.594]  He was getting in their face.
[03:44:28.594 --> 03:44:32.878]  He was not somebody who was going to be cowed down by a prosecutor and yet we were told that
[03:44:33.740 --> 03:44:40.983]  After they came against him with trumped up charges, that he committed suicide because he was concerned about 30 years in jail.
[03:44:40.983 --> 03:44:53.849]  The wife of the prosecutor who was coming after him, Carmen Ortiz, her husband, because she was getting criticized for all this, said she offered him a deal of only like 30 days to get out of this, not 30 years, if he would just plead guilty to something.
[03:44:53.849 --> 03:44:55.849]  And then removed that report.
[03:44:55.849 --> 03:44:59.231]  So we've seen this happen over and over again, but especially with the Clintons.
[03:44:59.591 --> 03:45:05.155]  We have this long list of Clinton sides and this is what he had said before he died about the Clinton Foundation.
[03:45:05.155 --> 03:45:10.458]  He said the Clinton Foundation, they're criminals, they're thieves, they're liars, they're a disgrace.
[03:45:10.458 --> 03:45:15.902]  He said that at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.
[03:45:15.902 --> 03:45:29.031]  And again, he was due to appear on Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.
[03:45:30.128 --> 03:45:38.257]  But then we find out, as he's talking about this, he said in his estimation, he was accused actually of fraud and corruption.
[03:45:38.257 --> 03:45:41.480]  He said, no, it's not me, it's the government, it's the Clintons.
[03:45:41.480 --> 03:45:48.167]  And what he said with that was there was only 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:45:49.108 --> 03:45:50.290]  Actually went to Haitians.
[03:45:50.290 --> 03:45:53.635]  He said another 9.6% went to the Haitian government.
[03:45:53.635 --> 03:46:00.784]  The remaining 89.8% or 5.4 billion dollars was funded to non-Haitian organizations.
[03:46:00.784 --> 03:46:04.269]  So there's two ways that the Haitians are getting ripped off in this.
[03:46:04.992 --> 03:46:11.174]  After a natural disaster, people send a lot of money to them, and of course, as we always see, corrupt governments take a big cut of that.
[03:46:11.174 --> 03:46:17.136]  But in this case, it was really more organizations like the Clinton Foundation that didn't turn the money over to them.
[03:46:17.136 --> 03:46:17.836]  They just kept it.
[03:46:17.836 --> 03:46:23.138]  They fundraised off of the earthquake, off of the tragedy, but then didn't do anything with the money.
[03:46:23.138 --> 03:46:24.778]  That's one aspect of it.
[03:46:24.778 --> 03:46:26.519]  The other thing, as we've talked about,
[03:46:27.519 --> 03:46:31.001]  As we've interviewed people from Haiti, talking about what's going on there.
[03:46:31.001 --> 03:46:33.903]  Why are the Clintons so interested in Haiti?
[03:46:33.903 --> 03:46:38.945]  Well, because there's a vast amount of mineral wealth there that's tied up in the land.
[03:46:38.945 --> 03:46:46.750]  And they want to be able to get the access to that mineral wealth, just as we saw the Clintons involved with the sale of 20% of our uranium to the Russians.
[03:46:46.750 --> 03:46:52.393]  They want to get their claws on what is happening in Haiti, even though it is one of the poorest countries in the world.
[03:46:52.393 --> 03:46:54.214]  We just had some friends get back from a
[03:46:54.634 --> 03:46:55.674]  We're good to go.
[03:47:19.764 --> 03:47:21.865]  Border wall and fence to keep the Haitians out.
[03:47:21.865 --> 03:47:22.205]  Why?
[03:47:22.205 --> 03:47:29.188]  Because even though the per capita income in Dominican Republic is only about $17,000, in Haiti it's only $769.
[03:47:29.188 --> 03:47:40.892]  So we're the poorest, if not the poorest country in the world, setting on some of the wealthiest reserves of minerals and other things in Haiti.
[03:47:40.892 --> 03:47:42.853]  That's why the Clintons are there.
[03:47:42.853 --> 03:47:44.113]  And as this article from SHTF
[03:47:46.714 --> 03:47:53.521]  Plan.com points out Eberwine was expected to testify, but then he winds up committing suicide shortly before.
[03:47:53.521 --> 03:47:55.082]  Where have we seen this before?
[03:47:55.082 --> 03:47:58.446]  Well, we've seen it all the time from the Clintons, haven't we?
[03:47:58.446 --> 03:47:59.467]  Think about Vince Foster.
[03:47:59.467 --> 03:48:04.492]  Think about all these other people that we have seen, the many Clinton-sides that happen over and over again.
[03:48:04.963 --> 03:48:11.150]  Real quickly, I want to talk about Rand Paul and what he had to say about healthcare, because I think he is spot on with what's going on.
[03:48:11.150 --> 03:48:15.616]  He said it's a giant bailout super fund for insurance companies.
[03:48:15.616 --> 03:48:16.557]  And he said this over the weekend.
[03:48:16.557 --> 03:48:22.764]  He said, I think the longer the bill is out there, the more conservative Republicans are going to discover that it is not repeal.
[03:48:23.445 --> 03:48:28.550]  And the more that everybody's going to discover that it keeps a fundamental flaw of Obamacare.
[03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:30.051]  He said that on Face the Nation yesterday.
[03:48:30.051 --> 03:48:36.798]  He said basically what the Republicans are trying to do is to subsidize the death spiral of Obamacare.
[03:48:36.798 --> 03:48:41.262]  That's precisely what McConnell and the so-called centrist Republicans are doing.
[03:48:41.262 --> 03:48:45.166]  They're the establishment and there's no difference between these people and the Democrats.
[03:48:45.166 --> 03:48:46.327]  Let's understand that.
[03:48:46.327 --> 03:48:48.149]  He said it also has nothing to do with repeal.
[03:48:48.689 --> 03:48:52.870]  Rand Paul said, I mean, we promised the voters that for four elections.
[03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:54.250]  Four elections!
[03:48:54.250 --> 03:48:55.911]  When are they going to keep their promise?
[03:48:55.911 --> 03:49:02.192]  He said, I'm not for any more taxpayer money going to an industry that makes $15 billion a year.
[03:49:02.192 --> 03:49:03.132]  They're getting their subsidies.
[03:49:03.132 --> 03:49:03.873]  Where are they getting it?
[03:49:03.873 --> 03:49:11.474]  As we pointed out with Jerome Corsi, they're stealing all of the assets of the now profitable Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac investments.
[03:49:11.474 --> 03:49:13.455]  These are things that people have invested in.
[03:49:13.455 --> 03:49:14.475]  As I said, my father
[03:49:15.195 --> 03:49:22.660]  When he was preparing for his retirement, he's now deceased, but he had invested money into these types of investments, Fannie and Freddie.
[03:49:22.660 --> 03:49:33.526]  They were conservative real estate mortgages that were guaranteed by the government, and yet it is the government that came in after Congress would not fund Obamacare, came in and took all the money there.
[03:49:33.526 --> 03:49:37.248]  They did what they called a net asset sweep, took everything out of it.
[03:49:37.248 --> 03:49:38.829]  It's basically what we call theft.
[03:49:39.588 --> 03:49:43.954]  And that's the way they're funding many of these subsidies, that and massive taxes.
[03:49:43.954 --> 03:49:54.006]  I think one of the most interesting things that came out of this over the last couple of days, this was all introduced on Friday, we saw the cruise amendment coming in and then we saw insurers coming out in opposition to the cruise amendment.
[03:49:54.006 --> 03:49:58.131]  Why would they oppose something that would allow them to offer different products?
[03:49:58.692 --> 03:50:02.515]  They don't want competition from even other insurers.
[03:50:02.515 --> 03:50:07.339]  They want to make sure that everybody is forced to buy their Cadillac policies.
[03:50:07.339 --> 03:50:13.583]  And when I say Cadillac policies, I mean having to buy maternity insurance if you're a young single male.
[03:50:13.583 --> 03:50:16.185]  They want everybody to pay for everything.
[03:50:16.185 --> 03:50:18.767]  And then they can justify higher and higher rates.
[03:50:18.767 --> 03:50:23.150]  People who are paying for this, and not getting it from subsidized stolen money,
[03:50:24.170 --> 03:50:27.211]  See that their insurance rates are going up, that they're skyrocketing.
[03:50:27.211 --> 03:50:30.953]  And we have these insurers now who don't want to have any competition.
[03:50:30.953 --> 03:50:40.897]  So what the Cruz Amendment said was if you sell the mandated policies that are in Obamacare, which the insurance policies, the insurance companies put that in there because that's what they wanted everybody to buy.
[03:50:40.897 --> 03:50:41.737]  Guess what?
[03:50:41.737 --> 03:50:43.138]  They don't want you having a choice.
[03:50:43.138 --> 03:50:45.359]  They don't want anybody offering you anything else.
[03:50:45.359 --> 03:50:50.401]  And if we go back and look at this, all of these prohibitions against selling insurance across state lines.
[03:50:50.981 --> 03:50:54.357]  He's probably there because the insurance companies lobbied for it.
[03:50:54.357 --> 03:50:55.322]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[03:52:02.110 --> 03:52:02.851]  Effective.
[03:52:03.735 --> 03:52:06.738]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:52:06.738 --> 03:52:10.922]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:52:10.922 --> 03:52:17.588]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:52:17.588 --> 03:52:21.311]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:52:22.032 --> 03:52:41.440]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:52:41.980 --> 03:52:46.085]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.

[03:54:58.295 --> 03:55:04.380]  I don't know how much longer that's going to last, but that's part of our July summer special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:04.380 --> 03:55:06.081]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:55:06.081 --> 03:55:11.886]  That's what allows us to grow and to extend the shows and the hours that we're going to be on air.
[03:55:11.886 --> 03:55:13.328]  I want to talk a little bit about this
[03:55:14.773 --> 03:55:15.493]  I don't know.
[03:55:34.358 --> 03:55:35.919]  And she had been speaking to the police.
[03:55:35.919 --> 03:55:36.800]  She called the police.
[03:55:36.800 --> 03:55:38.222]  She's standing there in her pajamas.
[03:55:38.222 --> 03:55:41.444]  She's talking to the police through the driver's window.
[03:55:41.444 --> 03:55:49.572]  And then somehow, for some reason, the cop that is sitting in the passenger seat pulls out a gun and shoots her dead.
[03:55:49.572 --> 03:55:50.853]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:55:50.853 --> 03:55:54.116]  How many times have we seen people who call the police
[03:55:55.296 --> 03:55:56.857]  Get shot by the police.
[03:55:56.857 --> 03:55:59.357]  And this is something that happens way too often.
[03:55:59.357 --> 03:56:00.998]  Anybody can make a mistake.
[03:56:00.998 --> 03:56:13.342]  But I have to say, when we are looking at the situation, for example, in New Mexico, we had that shooting, if you remember, a few years ago of a homeless man and it was all captured on the police body cams.
[03:56:14.182 --> 03:56:19.263]  And it was very disturbing to see how this went down and how they had been working with this guy for quite some time.
[03:56:19.263 --> 03:56:21.404]  They knew that he was not a danger to them.
[03:56:21.404 --> 03:56:26.986]  They shot him dead from a short distance after they had been talking to him for quite some time.
[03:56:26.986 --> 03:56:38.409]  And at the same time, we had someone who was there in New Mexico who had been one of the instructors at the State Police Academy and had been teaching
[03:56:39.780 --> 03:56:47.230]  Officers coming in, training officers for decades say, I am not going to teach your shoot first curriculum.
[03:56:47.230 --> 03:56:49.933]  You have changed the way that we interact with the public.
[03:56:49.933 --> 03:56:53.678]  You have told and you're teaching the officers to shoot first.
[03:56:53.678 --> 03:56:55.540]  And this is an experienced police instructor.
[03:56:55.540 --> 03:56:56.621]  He says, I'm not going to be a part of that.
[03:56:57.731 --> 03:57:00.992]  This is the issue, folks, the training that we have here.
[03:57:00.992 --> 03:57:05.653]  This guy who shot this lady dead was a relatively new officer.
[03:57:05.653 --> 03:57:12.534]  I think he had been working for the police for only about two years, so something of a rookie.
[03:57:12.534 --> 03:57:17.635]  But the real issue is the way that they're training them to shoot first issues.
[03:57:17.635 --> 03:57:25.157]  And when I look at this article that was on the Drudge Report about facial recognition coming to police body cameras, do you realize just how dangerous this is?
[03:57:26.325 --> 03:57:33.368]  We've had situations, I remember seeing, artificial intelligence is going to alert police to suspicious behavior.
[03:57:33.368 --> 03:57:39.250]  And they call the SWAT team on a guy that was essentially trying to change his flat tire.
[03:57:39.250 --> 03:57:44.252]  They saw him kind of lurking around and standing around the outside of the vehicle for a while.
[03:57:44.252 --> 03:57:48.813]  Then he bends down, you can't see him on the other side of the car.
[03:57:48.813 --> 03:57:51.875]  So they thought he was stealing the car, that he's getting under the car and stealing it.
[03:57:51.875 --> 03:57:54.435]  But it was flagged by the artificial intelligence.
[03:57:54.435 --> 03:57:55.416]  When the police are told
[03:57:56.036 --> 03:58:02.297]  That there's some kind of crime going, that's ongoing, that could be a danger to them.
[03:58:02.297 --> 03:58:05.738]  Then they come with their guns drawn and they're ready to shoot.
[03:58:05.738 --> 03:58:07.418]  And they are instructed to do that.
[03:58:07.418 --> 03:58:08.879]  It is a shoot first curriculum.
[03:58:08.879 --> 03:58:11.679]  That's part of really what we saw with Philando Castile.
[03:58:11.679 --> 03:58:24.422]  Absolutely outrageous that this guy, who was pulled over for a minor traffic violation, of course the reason the black community is upset about this, he's pulled over 52 times in a short period for minor traffic violations, never had done anything wrong.
[03:58:24.642 --> 03:58:30.726]  He was licensed to carry, he told them I've got a gun on, and they get in this back and forth and he gets shot seven times.
[03:58:30.726 --> 03:58:32.067]  That was the other part of it.
[03:58:32.067 --> 03:58:34.409]  That is what we have to be concerned about.
[03:58:34.409 --> 03:58:39.652]  Black or white, we have to change the way that the police are engaging with all of us.
[03:58:39.652 --> 03:58:41.454]  We have to get control over that.
[03:58:41.454 --> 03:58:46.637]  Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:58:46.637 --> 03:58:50.380]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
