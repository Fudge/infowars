[00:00:01.452 --> 00:00:09.615]  You want answers?
[00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.436]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:16.518]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:20.059]  Folks, I have plugged maybe two hours.
[00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:32.237]  My friends, we're in the middle of the Second American Revolution.
[00:00:59.485 --> 00:01:04.609]  The globalist social engineers are trying to play us off against each other in a big way.
[00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:13.895]  They're trying to play us off according to race, according to region, according to ethnicity, background, sexual orientation, male, female.
[00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:21.320]  And again, it's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the Facebook documents, it's in their own admissions that they're cold-bloodedly doing this.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.301]  And it's up to us
[00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:31.884]  To understand they're doing that, and to transcend it, and to educate others about what's happening and what is unfolding.
[00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:39.327]  The divide and conquer we're witnessing is a desperate last ditch attempt.
[00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:52.512]  To have this country forget that we were under globalist control, forget that the social compact had been broken, forget that we had been de-industrialized, and to basically grab
[00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:58.550]  Victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.471]  We've beaten the globalists.
[00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:10.859]  The fact that we're aware of their multi-national operation, the fact that we're aware of their private fellow reserve, the fact that the public is becoming more and more informed, that's the end of their operation.
[00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:22.028]  So if we can beat their censorship, if we can reach out to other folks that aren't awake yet, and if we can elect good people to public office, but also rebuild our industrial and cultural base,
[00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:26.550]  America's best days are ahead of us, not behind us.
[00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.314]  To quote Merle Haggard, the late great, we don't have to keep rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell.
[00:02:33.314 --> 00:02:36.236]  With no chance for freedom or the Liberty Bell, it's here.
[00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:50.031]  But at the same time, the globalists are trying to cut off the funding of organizations and institutions and operations that are telling the truth and that are exposing their narrative in real time.
[00:02:50.031 --> 00:03:03.619]  That's why this Christmas, it is more important than ever to support InfoWars because you're supporting yourself and you can beat the crowds, beat the traffic, beat the high prices, beat the garbage, beat the additives.
[00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:14.986]  And get, from the biggest budget to the lowest budget, high quality products that you, your family, your friends, your loved ones, that those that you're giving gifts need.

[00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:57.602]  Don't shop with the globalists.
[00:03:57.602 --> 00:03:58.862]  Don't trade with the enemy.
[00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:04.424]  As much as you can, and none of us are perfect, support independent media that stands up for what's right.

[00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:02.517]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:02.517 --> 00:05:10.600]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.882]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:18.423]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:05:18.423 --> 00:05:22.645]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:25.066]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:33.012]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:05:33.012 --> 00:05:41.079]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:48.265]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:49.706]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:51.528]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:52.348 --> 00:05:55.810]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.932]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:12.819]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:13.639]  Mother!
[00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:25.860]  Tell your children not to walk my way Tell your children not to hear my words What they mean, what they say Mother
[00:06:30.037 --> 00:06:32.379]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, into the third hour.
[00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:43.289]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're joined by really an American hero, William Binney, former technical director of the National Security Agency, one of the most famous codebreakers in U.S.
[00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:49.335]  history, and the equivalent of a multi-star general when he was heading up that agency.
[00:06:49.335 --> 00:06:55.881]  He's also been a whistleblower to Congress, been SWAT teamed, been targeted, been persecuted, but
[00:06:56.221 --> 00:06:59.584]  Never charged with anything, because it was all intimidation.
[00:06:59.584 --> 00:07:01.886]  ExposedFacts.org.
[00:07:01.886 --> 00:07:05.529]  AGoodAmerican.org is the award-winning film he's in.
[00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:11.434]  He was also the main technical director and fact director for Oliver Stone's incredible film, Snowden.
[00:07:12.412 --> 00:07:21.535]  So much of what we now know about the illegal spy grid being used against us for the political class is thanks to him, Mr. Drake, Sybil Edmonds, and many others.
[00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:25.257]  But he is the chief whistleblower out there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:30.519]  He's going to be talking about PGknowledge.eu today and some of the important work he's doing.
[00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:35.801]  But first off, he hasn't talked a lot about this, but today he said he's ready to talk about it.
[00:07:36.761 --> 00:07:45.928]  In light of the whole Russiagate investigation, he wants to get into that and his meeting with the CIA director, Mr. Pompeo, a few weeks ago.
[00:07:45.928 --> 00:07:53.373]  So we're going to talk about how that meeting took place and as much as he can now reveal to this audience today.
[00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:58.116]  So thank you so much, William Benny, for joining us to discuss this.
[00:07:58.116 --> 00:07:59.777]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:07:59.777 --> 00:08:01.058]  Well, you've got the floor.
[00:08:01.058 --> 00:08:01.939]  Where would you like to start?
[00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:16.229]  Well, I think we should start with the research we've been doing on the data allegedly coming from a hack by the Russians to the DNC server.
[00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:28.495]  This was the data that was made available from Guccifer 2 that talked about the leak or the hack that he called a hack on the 5th of July of 2016.
[00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:32.897]  That data he made available for us to look at, so we started looking at it.
[00:08:33.622 --> 00:08:41.247]  And the first thing we found was the speeds were rather high for a transfer across the web to Europe from the US.
[00:08:41.923 --> 00:08:55.953]  In fact, the speed, I was here in Europe with Duncan Campbell reviewing all this data again, and we found that the highest speed that that data ran from was taken down off the server, supposedly.
[00:08:55.953 --> 00:08:59.196]  This is all alleged now.
[00:08:59.196 --> 00:09:00.537]  So it was 49.1 megabytes per second.
[00:09:04.082 --> 00:09:10.291]  Which is roughly a little over four times the rate that we could get by a transfer.
[00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:17.662]  We also attempted to transfer data across the Atlantic to Europe, the various places in Amsterdam, the UK.
[00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:28.156]  One of the fellows even looked at transferring it to Belgrade and also Albania, but it was pointless to even try because the network couldn't even handle it anywhere near it there.
[00:09:28.156 --> 00:09:38.305]  So the highest we got was roughly one-fourth the speed necessary to transfer the data, which meant it was impossible to go across the net.
[00:09:38.305 --> 00:09:43.250]  But it is, however, compatible with a download to a thumb drive.
[00:09:44.122 --> 00:09:48.126]  So, if you had a USB thumb drive, you could download it at those speeds.
[00:09:48.126 --> 00:10:03.299]  So what you're saying, as a technical expert who tested it, this was an inside job, just like Snowden doing on a thumb drive, at point-blank range, that's the speeds, that this was basically impossible to be an outside hack, which is what we know from British ambassadors, from spies, from other leaks.
[00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:08.224]  Can you then quantify why Trump wanted you to meet with Pompeo to explain this to him?
[00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:20.442]  Well, he, Director Pompeo said to me when I first sat down, he said, the president said I should talk to you if I wanted to get facts about the Russiagate.
[00:10:20.442 --> 00:10:32.908]  That was really a shocking statement to me, because what that really says to me is the intelligence agencies aren't even telling the president or the head of the CIA the facts in the case.
[00:10:32.908 --> 00:10:36.310]  I mean, if he has to ask me what the facts are,
[00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:48.019]  Why aren't the intelligence agencies, the FBI, NSA, CIA, the members of the CIA, telling even their president or the chief of the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency?
[00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:52.902]  And I know it's all classified, you can't get into it, but a lot of this is public now.
[00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:59.925]  The president has the code keys, he's got authorization, he could go in and see all this, but of course it was...
[00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:08.026]  Of course, it was the Obama holdovers, we know, up until Trump got into office that were still there with the keys, spying on the President-elect.
[00:11:08.026 --> 00:11:10.107]  We now know that.
[00:11:10.107 --> 00:11:25.049]  Yes, for example, early on when the conversation between President Trump and the President of Mexico and Australia were released, I mean, that's a clear indication that that kind of information, to me, came from NSA.
[00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:29.530]  Because any communications of the President leaving the White House are encrypted.
[00:11:30.342 --> 00:11:37.364]  So that the agency that has the keys and provides the equipment and the keys for the president to communicate is NSA.
[00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:42.446]  So they would be able to decrypt and translate all those conversations.
[00:11:42.446 --> 00:11:45.927]  So they certainly are a prime suspect for releasing that.
[00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:49.068]  But let me get back to that hack in June, July of 2016.
[00:11:49.068 --> 00:11:50.469]  There's more to it than just that.
[00:11:55.784 --> 00:11:59.365]  When we looked at the data, there were two batches of releases.
[00:11:59.365 --> 00:12:02.826]  The main one was dated the 5th of July.
[00:12:02.826 --> 00:12:07.968]  There was a later one dated the 1st of September, also from Guccifer 2.
[00:12:07.968 --> 00:12:20.331]  But when you looked at them, and if you only looked at minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, those two data sets merge.
[00:12:20.331 --> 00:12:22.792]  They merge right together like a glove on a hand.
[00:12:24.373 --> 00:12:28.206]  So that you basically would have one continuous set of information.
[00:12:29.204 --> 00:12:33.686]  So it means to us that Guccifer 2 is playing games, and that this wasn't even a hack.
[00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:40.148]  You don't even know if it was a hack of the DNC, or if it was something downloaded, transferred somewhere else, and then downloaded again.
[00:12:40.148 --> 00:12:43.529]  Sir, I know this is simple for you as a top expert, but just explain.
[00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:55.053]  Not only transfer rates showed how to be done point-blank at the computer, at the server itself, but also the data, the way it was taken down and put down together, was all done together, congruent at one time.
[00:12:55.888 --> 00:13:00.189]  Yeah, and it basically says that Goose for Two is playing a game with us, right?
[00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:03.430]  They're playing a game with us and everybody else.
[00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.952]  Because it's not the Russians that can be inside these secret facilities, obviously, getting the info.
[00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:16.734]  Yeah, well, that plus all of the indications are that it wasn't even a hack at all in any way, shape, or form.
[00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:18.534]  Wow, so you explain this to Pompeo.
[00:13:18.534 --> 00:13:20.115]  Please continue.
[00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:23.436]  Yes, and also I said that
[00:13:25.043 --> 00:13:33.793]  If members of Congress are going to call this an act of war, then they ought to do like President John F. Kennedy did and President Reagan.
[00:13:33.793 --> 00:13:40.921]  Kennedy released the photographs of the missiles in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis because it was something that was very serious.
[00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:57.811]  And also, when the Russians shot down the Korean South Korean airline over Sakhalin Island, he released the air ground to air control of the fighters giving where the ground control ordered the shoot down of the plane.
[00:13:57.811 --> 00:14:11.120]  So those were serious situations and they basically declassified classified information so that they could show how how serious the situation was and prove it to the to the American public and everyone else.
[00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:14.096]  Incredible!
[00:14:14.096 --> 00:14:25.604]  Now, I know you're a scientist, a computer scientist, so you just go off the facts, but just big picture, looking at this with William Binney, who's blown all this wide open, the President wanted you to go talk to the head of the CIA.
[00:14:25.604 --> 00:14:28.126]  He doesn't even have the keys to the NSA!
[00:14:28.126 --> 00:14:42.217]  He can get into all this, they've got him sequestered, but he's getting enough info to know he needs to talk to you, showing, again, the whole rush of things made up, it was an inside job of people trying to expose the criminality of Hillary, and what was going on!
[00:14:43.843 --> 00:14:55.865]  Yeah, there's really no guarantee that even if he asks for all the information about Russiagate that's held by NSA or the FBI, that they'll even give it to him.
[00:14:55.865 --> 00:15:02.546]  Because if they don't want to give away information to anybody, they can keep it and hide it internally.
[00:15:02.546 --> 00:15:05.927]  They don't have to share it with anyone.
[00:15:05.927 --> 00:15:11.868]  Couldn't the President appoint you as a special investigator and you've got the clearances to go in there and investigate for him?
[00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.959]  Well, I don't have the clearances anymore.
[00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:18.681]  But the President could get those for you.
[00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:21.304]  Yes, yes he could, yes.
[00:15:21.304 --> 00:15:23.506]  That's true.
[00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.809]  Would you take that job if the President authorized you to?
[00:15:27.503 --> 00:15:29.844]  Uh, if you wanted me to do that, I would do that.
[00:15:29.844 --> 00:15:30.904]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:32.184]  And that'd be their worst nightmare.
[00:15:32.184 --> 00:15:34.224]  I mean, we can't trust the former head of the NSA.
[00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:34.905]  Who can we trust?
[00:15:34.905 --> 00:15:38.765]  I mean, it's just a bunch of politicos in there with the code keys.
[00:15:38.765 --> 00:15:43.706]  Samantha Powers, all of them in there, meeting with the former CIA director and everybody to set up Trump.
[00:15:43.706 --> 00:15:47.087]  I mean, these people are just, have committed incredible crimes, in my view.
[00:15:47.087 --> 00:15:50.068]  We'll be back with William Benning, a true American hero.
[00:15:50.068 --> 00:15:52.728]  There's John Wayne the actor, then there's the real John Waynes.
[00:15:52.728 --> 00:15:54.069]  William Benning's one of those.
[00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:55.129]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.629]  Stay with us.
[00:15:58.308 --> 00:16:00.909]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[00:16:00.909 --> 00:16:15.516]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:23.140]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.

[00:18:27.822 --> 00:18:36.564]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:18:36.564 --> 00:18:44.667]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[00:20:01.781 --> 00:20:04.443]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.475 --> 00:20:18.765]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:46.022 --> 00:21:00.552]  Ladies and gentlemen, William Binney, the former head of technical operations at the National Security Agency, the man behind the movie Snowden, the main expert on that, is our guest this segment and next.
[00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.273]  He is on the road in Europe.
[00:21:03.434 --> 00:21:08.180]  His computer battery will probably last about 45 after or so, but if it cuts out, he'll be gone.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.323]  This is so huge, okay?
[00:21:10.323 --> 00:21:12.726]  He's one of the leading experts in the world.
[00:21:12.726 --> 00:21:18.272]  The president wanted him to meet with the CIA director because they're trying to understand what's going on.
[00:21:18.272 --> 00:21:22.517]  Because this is so complex and the agencies don't tell each other a lot of information.
[00:21:23.118 --> 00:21:27.603]  And so here is William Binney looking at the supposed Russian hack they're saying.
[00:21:27.603 --> 00:21:30.046]  They've never proven Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian.
[00:21:30.046 --> 00:21:33.771]  But now we know what British ambassadors and others have said they've been told.
[00:21:33.771 --> 00:21:41.339]  They've said they've met with the supposed Guccifer and that it was a group of US intelligence operatives and people that were upset about what was happening.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:55.408]  I have had high-level contacts confirm that to me back during the election and I know that people like Eric Prince got information that I had separately had but not released about it and that Eric Prince knows.
[00:21:55.408 --> 00:21:57.730]  So all I'm saying is this is not a secret.
[00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.612]  This has been in British and German newspapers but not really in our news.
[00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:03.093]  It's a huge scandal.
[00:22:03.093 --> 00:22:08.796]  It's the key to understanding Russiagate and how they're trying to remove our president with zero evidence.
[00:22:08.796 --> 00:22:11.238]  They've got NSA transcripts of General Flynn
[00:22:11.698 --> 00:22:22.447]  Not doing anything wrong, but then an FBI agent who worked for Hillary, who's disgraced, is the one that wrote up the forms claiming what he told them didn't match the NSA spying.
[00:22:22.447 --> 00:22:27.291]  So this is huge, huge news and blows the whole Russian narrative wide open.
[00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:31.475]  William Benny, please, break this down and get into other angles, because again, you're the expert.
[00:22:33.272 --> 00:22:42.578]  Well, we're looking at other evidence also, technical evidence, that looks like even earlier claims might be a total sham also.
[00:22:42.578 --> 00:22:47.761]  So in other words, it looks like virtually all of this data has been a fabrication.
[00:22:48.827 --> 00:22:53.631]  That's been created as a diversion, basically, so that we can pay attention.
[00:22:53.631 --> 00:22:55.693]  It's like we're playing the Wizard of Oz game.
[00:22:55.693 --> 00:22:56.493]  Pay attention.
[00:22:56.493 --> 00:22:58.735]  Don't pay any attention to the man behind the curtain.
[00:22:58.735 --> 00:23:03.439]  Look at all the side show that's going on.
[00:23:03.439 --> 00:23:05.401]  Pay attention over here.
[00:23:05.401 --> 00:23:05.961]  Don't look at me.
[00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:12.295]  I just think that this whole thing has been a setup from the beginning.
[00:23:12.295 --> 00:23:17.737]  And it's being, right now, the technical evidence is starting to show that and prove that.
[00:23:17.737 --> 00:23:22.538]  And we'll be publishing information about that, hopefully very soon.
[00:23:22.538 --> 00:23:24.519]  Wow.
[00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:28.680]  Was your whole meeting with Pompeo, did he say it was off record?
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.181]  Or what else can you tell us about this amazing meeting requested by the President?
[00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:35.644]  No, he didn't say it was off the record or anything.
[00:23:35.644 --> 00:23:42.126]  He just said he wanted to talk to me about getting, the President asked him to talk to me about getting facts about Rushgate.
[00:23:42.126 --> 00:23:51.989]  So I just told him everything I knew at the time, and we're getting more and more information that kind of corroborates everything we've been saying about it being a fabrication.
[00:23:51.989 --> 00:23:55.611]  And we'll be adding that publicly shortly, I hope.
[00:23:57.197 --> 00:23:59.218]  It's a matter of verifying everything we've done.
[00:23:59.218 --> 00:24:02.079]  We don't want to say something that we can't actually show and prove.
[00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:04.099]  Wow.
[00:24:04.099 --> 00:24:07.721]  Well, I know that you've received classified awards.
[00:24:07.721 --> 00:24:12.262]  You can't talk about those, but it's been reported that you've gotten some of the biggest awards in the country you can get.
[00:24:12.262 --> 00:24:18.924]  I mean, you were running operations against the Russians, and so you'd be the expert to investigate the Russians.
[00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:20.445]  But from your
[00:24:20.945 --> 00:24:42.115]  You know, Spy Chief Gravitas, when you say it looks like it's a setup beyond just an inside job, without getting into statecraft and things, as an expert, what are you seeing?
[00:24:42.115 --> 00:24:46.897]  Well, there are people in other countries involved, like in the UK, with the
[00:24:48.422 --> 00:24:52.645]  Suppose a report from the British intelligence, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:24:52.645 --> 00:25:03.954]  And also, internally, if you believe Cy Hirsch, what he's saying is people in the FBI know exactly who leaked the data, and they're not talking about that.
[00:25:03.954 --> 00:25:11.739]  And so there are people in the FBI, people in lower ranks in the CIA, also people in NSA who are involved in all of this.
[00:25:13.401 --> 00:25:22.331]  Those are the three agencies of the main ones who made up the, you know, the Intelligence Community Assessment, where they claimed 17 intelligence agencies.
[00:25:22.331 --> 00:25:23.472]  Well, it was really only three.
[00:25:23.472 --> 00:25:30.018]  And it was hand-picked people from those three to come up with a predetermined outcome, which is what they did.
[00:25:30.018 --> 00:25:35.104]  And they wrote a 14-page ICA Intelligence Community Assessment paper
[00:25:35.746 --> 00:25:44.574]  That started out by saying we have high confidence that and it's our judgment that we have high confidence that this uh that the Russians had to hack but then on the very bottom page 13 it says
[00:25:45.842 --> 00:25:51.184]  Please don't interpret our judgment to mean that we have absolute facts to prove that this is absolutely true.
[00:25:51.184 --> 00:26:03.288]  So what they're saying is, you know, this whole report was a big sham, and they had no evidence whatsoever, nothing to back up any claim they were making, and it was just, you know, another fabrication.
[00:26:03.288 --> 00:26:07.069]  So it just shows you the extent of the organization behind this charade.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.021]  Well I know where to look out of these 17 agencies.
[00:26:11.021 --> 00:26:20.965]  It's that handful of people that put out the hoax and all 17 agencies all concurred and then who put out these scurrilous fake reports.
[00:26:20.965 --> 00:26:27.288]  I think you start with them in your investigation of who really cooked all this garbage up.
[00:26:27.288 --> 00:26:33.170]  If you were speaking to the president, and he obviously listens to what you have to say and what you write, what would you say he needs to do next?
[00:26:34.816 --> 00:26:36.337]  I would say he needs to clean house.
[00:26:36.337 --> 00:26:43.281]  He's got to start firing people who are in charge of these agencies and replace them with people who will do a proper job.
[00:26:43.281 --> 00:26:52.166]  And that means cleaning out the internally, cleaning out the agencies and making sure they start to obey the Constitution, which they're not doing now.
[00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:54.828]  And that includes the Department of Justice.
[00:26:54.828 --> 00:26:57.209]  I'm not excluding them either.
[00:26:57.209 --> 00:27:03.673]  They're a part of this charade too, in one form or another, covering up for the people who are involved in this.
[00:27:04.306 --> 00:27:07.990]  Because if the FBI knows who did it, they also know, at least some of them.
[00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.172]  Now whether they're telling anybody, that's another story.
[00:27:22.489 --> 00:27:24.832]  We learned by Obama when he first got into office.
[00:27:24.832 --> 00:27:26.073]  I was also on the list.
[00:27:26.073 --> 00:27:28.616]  That was a whole data leak that came out of federal law enforcement.
[00:27:28.616 --> 00:27:32.380]  And there were hundreds of thousands of names and phone numbers of mine that were private.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.782]  And I even had some of Trump's private numbers.
[00:27:33.782 --> 00:27:38.127]  Those were his numbers at Mar-a-Lago and also one of his private numbers at Trump Tower.
[00:27:38.127 --> 00:27:40.729]  I never even had the nerve to use, but we got the list.
[00:27:40.729 --> 00:27:42.692]  I was like, wow, that's the number I got for him at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:27:43.232 --> 00:27:49.823]  So they were illegally surveilling him all these years and intensified during the campaign and then they can't even find anything.
[00:27:49.823 --> 00:27:54.291]  That shows he's got a pretty good record if they're illegally spying on him and nothing's there.
[00:27:56.178 --> 00:28:13.271]  Yeah, but it also shows all the illegality that they've been involved in, including violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, trying to use his communications without warrants against him in terms of, you know, charging him with something.
[00:28:13.271 --> 00:28:21.458]  That is a clear violation of the founding principles of our nation, and this is fundamentally treason at the highest levels, in my view.
[00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.432]  You're right, William Benny's our guest.
[00:28:25.432 --> 00:28:27.794]  I think it's fair to say that the House of Cards is coming down.
[00:28:27.794 --> 00:28:28.534]  I mean, it's coming out.
[00:28:28.534 --> 00:28:29.475]  They surveilled them.
[00:28:29.475 --> 00:28:30.756]  It's in the Flynn documents.
[00:28:30.756 --> 00:28:31.997]  They got caught lying.
[00:28:31.997 --> 00:28:41.506]  So what do we do legally now to make sure that they end up getting in trouble before they launch the next part of their fiction, as Ron Paul called it last week, as you called it, a charade.
[00:28:42.447 --> 00:28:46.270]  Uh, where they're planning to indict the President for obstruction of justice.
[00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.652]  The word is, as early as Christmas.
[00:28:48.652 --> 00:28:52.856]  And I reported that Friday, and now NBC News yesterday said that that is the word.
[00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:54.677]  They're looking to indict the President.
[00:28:54.677 --> 00:28:56.059]  We'll be back with William Binning.

[00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:14.931]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:15.211 --> 00:32:20.096]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:20.096 --> 00:32:26.882]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:26.882 --> 00:32:34.069]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:34.069 --> 00:32:40.935]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:41.075 --> 00:32:45.556]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:45.556 --> 00:32:48.937]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:32:48.937 --> 00:32:55.238]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:32:55.238 --> 00:33:01.179]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.764 --> 00:33:22.010]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:27.313]  He is Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.313 --> 00:33:34.839]  And that doesn't mean I have all the answers, but the amazing guests we have like William Binney and Dr. Ron Paul and others, they do have the answers.
[00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:40.566]  And I was just on the website pgknowledge.eu and the Good American and a bunch of others.
[00:33:40.566 --> 00:33:44.871]  They've got the documents and the breakdowns of the fraud that it was an internal deal.
[00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:46.993]  There was no Russian hacking.
[00:33:46.993 --> 00:33:49.215]  They're just involved in a giant hoax.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:54.321]  And they want to basically have it where any surveillance of their illegal activity is supposedly Russian.
[00:33:54.321 --> 00:33:55.762]  Because they're committing all these crimes.
[00:33:56.423 --> 00:33:59.766]  But, again, William Binning is our guest.
[00:33:59.766 --> 00:34:02.049]  pgknowledge.eu.
[00:34:02.049 --> 00:34:04.391]  The film, A Good American.
[00:34:04.391 --> 00:34:10.237]  In the nine minutes we have left, sir, please break down the great work you're doing in Europe.
[00:34:10.237 --> 00:34:17.664]  Again, it's so important the President asked you to meet with the CIA Director and just other key facts that folks should be made aware of.
[00:34:19.505 --> 00:34:24.829]  Well, first of all, I would recommend that they take a look at A Good American, the movie.
[00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:32.856]  It's only something like $4 to look at Netflix and so on, on web, and you can access it there.
[00:34:32.856 --> 00:34:35.598]  It really gives you the background.
[00:34:35.598 --> 00:34:47.027]  My career in NSA gives you the idea how intelligence works, but also it leads you into understanding how they're doing this mass surveillance and what it means and how it can all be pulled together.
[00:34:48.077 --> 00:34:57.200]  And then, of course, it also gives you the idea of how they're violating the Constitution and everybody's rights, even though they don't know it.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:10.243]  But they shouldn't go around saying things like, I'm not doing anything wrong, so I have nothing to fear, simply because, you know, they're not really free to have free thoughts and be creative and innovative without having the government watch you.
[00:35:10.243 --> 00:35:16.085]  Because if you start doing something that is not compatible with their thinking, they'll come after you, just like they did us.
[00:35:17.012 --> 00:35:33.265]  And so they made it impossible fundamentally for us to do the kind of analytic job that we had developed inside NSA and do a similar job outside commercially or even with other departments of government they wouldn't let us do it.
[00:35:33.265 --> 00:35:45.174]  They got us fired and contracts terminated and it was all series of things they did first at the NGO and then at the INSCOM and then at Customs and Border Protection and
[00:35:46.415 --> 00:35:52.801]  So, everywhere we went, they made sure that we couldn't succeed at that job.
[00:35:52.801 --> 00:36:11.197]  So, eventually, and then the Department of Justice started coming after us, trying to put us in jail with fabricated evidence, and we stopped all that by telling them that we had exculpatory data and evidence then that they were doing, their effort was malicious prosecution, and then they finally left us alone.
[00:36:11.994 --> 00:36:22.219]  So in the end, you know, after so many years of that, we basically found an opportunity over here in Europe where they value privacy more.
[00:36:22.219 --> 00:36:32.064]  And we decided to come over here and do this job over here, put together systems that will allow us to analyze massive amounts of data and pull out only what's necessary and what's relevant.
[00:36:32.825 --> 00:36:37.086]  And make sense of massive data, which we could have done in the U.S.
[00:36:37.086 --> 00:36:40.027]  20 years ago, but they denied it and kept us from doing it.
[00:36:40.027 --> 00:36:42.468]  So we're over here now doing that.
[00:36:42.468 --> 00:36:50.830]  And we're looking at commercial applications, insurance and banking and all kinds of applications on massive data around Europe.
[00:36:52.375 --> 00:37:09.408]  So basically the trailblazing research you did that could actually target real terrorists, real criminals, and not violate everybody's privacy, at the same time really stopping disasters, you've run into folks in Europe that are actually looking at allowing you to actually try to build that?
[00:37:09.408 --> 00:37:16.494]  Yeah, and they're actually helping us by, you know, they're organizing and we're forming a company and they're backing us and financing it.
[00:37:16.494 --> 00:37:18.735]  So yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:18.735 --> 00:37:19.396]  That's amazing.
[00:37:21.932 --> 00:37:23.335]  A good American is amazing.
[00:37:36.789 --> 00:37:49.242]  The political class is making hundreds of billions of dollars off this giant super spy grid that spies on everything, but then it's so massively over-targeted it then does nothing to actually stop real problems.
[00:37:49.242 --> 00:37:54.648]  It violates everybody's rights and then lets the political class use it in political campaigns
[00:37:55.649 --> 00:38:03.891]  Not just against Republicans, but the Democrats and the CIA have used it against Dianne Feinstein and others, and it's all admitted they've illegally done it.
[00:38:03.891 --> 00:38:14.834]  And it's now this nightmare with a new superclass, with godlike omnipresent surveillance powers, dragnetting their political opposition.
[00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:17.455]  It's just astounding.
[00:38:17.455 --> 00:38:24.377]  Yeah, and they're acting like they have no respect for the law, and they're above the law, and nobody's going to do anything about it.
[00:38:24.927 --> 00:38:28.950]  I mean, here you have these people lying directly in Congress and everybody knows it.
[00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.753]  They got caught at it and still nothing happens.
[00:38:31.753 --> 00:38:33.874]  Now what is the matter with the Department of Justice?
[00:38:33.874 --> 00:38:36.256]  Why aren't they holding these people accountable?
[00:38:36.256 --> 00:38:41.000]  I mean, they certainly do that with whistleblowers who are exposing the problems and the crimes.
[00:38:41.676 --> 00:38:47.501]  So, anybody who exposes something, you step on them, and everybody else who commits them, you give them retroactively.
[00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:53.766]  I was about to say, Loretta Lynch, first they lied about the tarmac meeting, then when it came out, it was totally illegal.
[00:38:53.766 --> 00:38:56.588]  He was under criminal investigation by her.
[00:38:56.588 --> 00:38:59.230]  The FBI documents have now been released by the FBI.
[00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:02.233]  They're trying to find out if it was a cop or whoever to get them fired.
[00:39:02.773 --> 00:39:04.634]  Right, and you can also don't forget that Mueller and Comey
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:49.900]  We're the two of the main players back in as early as 2001 and 2004 in the Department of Justice and the FBI who actually were using the Stellar Wind program, the illegally acquired data, against individuals inside the United States for common criminal activity.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:53.164]  And of course then they did the parallel construction of the DEA and the rest of it.
[00:39:54.324 --> 00:39:59.928]  And then so, they were in charge, I guess, later when you got SWAT teamed, too, right?
[00:39:59.928 --> 00:40:02.650]  I mean, these are monsters.
[00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:03.311]  That's right.
[00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:05.833]  They're basic criminals.
[00:40:05.833 --> 00:40:06.674]  That's all.
[00:40:06.674 --> 00:40:08.015]  Gosh!
[00:40:08.015 --> 00:40:11.337]  And they know it's criminal what they did, and it's all come out!
[00:40:11.337 --> 00:40:12.378]  Wow!
[00:40:12.378 --> 00:40:20.064]  Well, I tell you, if we can just get rid of these guys... That's why I'm calling our Department of Justice now our Department of Just Us.
[00:40:21.854 --> 00:40:22.835]  Wow.
[00:40:22.835 --> 00:40:29.560]  Well, sir, I'm just blown away by your courage and Mr. Drake's courage and all the others and what you've gone through and how they tried to put you guys in prison.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.400]  That's a whole other story.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.304]  But then Patriots Inside Justice would leak that you'd been set up.
[00:40:35.304 --> 00:40:40.267]  So there is a God, there is justice, but good men and women have to stand up and have to tell the truth.
[00:40:40.267 --> 00:40:43.410]  I hope this whole Clinton, globalist, Bush,
[00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:53.238]  Establishment swamp face sucker can finally be removed off our face and I think it says a lot about Trump that he had Pompeo meet with you and that he's the target of these people.
[00:40:53.238 --> 00:40:58.883]  I mean I think it says a lot about Trump that he's doing that.
[00:40:58.883 --> 00:41:02.767]  Yeah I think they're really afraid of him and what he'll be able to achieve.
[00:41:03.639 --> 00:41:10.865]  They're also afraid of him because he might see through them, which I think he does, and start to break up their game.
[00:41:10.865 --> 00:41:12.787]  That's one of the things they don't want to happen.
[00:41:12.787 --> 00:41:17.971]  I mean, the thing that they fear most is sunlight on the activities they've been performing.
[00:41:18.587 --> 00:41:21.928]  And they want to keep it, that's why the mainstream media is one of their main targets.
[00:41:21.928 --> 00:41:29.390]  So they can't, they won't broadcast any other opinions or views other than the ones they want shared.
[00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:36.733]  So, you know, I think the basic problem with why they hate Trump so much is because they fear him so much.
[00:41:37.745 --> 00:42:00.775]  That's right, and as you've said, now Google, Facebook, Twitter, they're using NSA style tools to spy on liberal, conservative, you name it, outside speech, and then censor us in real time, not just keep you off mainstream news, not just keep me off, but then censor us in real time, not because we're fake news, but because we're researched real news.
[00:42:02.287 --> 00:42:03.508]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:42:03.508 --> 00:42:05.889]  And you can't have that in a controlled environment.
[00:42:05.889 --> 00:42:13.534]  That's also what one of the reasons, one of the things I said about the bulk surveillance is that one of the main objectives is population control.
[00:42:13.534 --> 00:42:19.779]  Now, also to make that happen, you have to control the narrative that's fed to the larger population of the country.
[00:42:19.779 --> 00:42:22.020]  And that takes the mainstream media.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.341]  And that's basically what's happening
[00:42:23.979 --> 00:42:31.342]  They are, in fact, controlled by the government, the shadow government, and those who want to control the narrative.
[00:42:31.342 --> 00:42:34.843]  And now they admit they want to sew it up in free speech, have authoritarianism.
[00:42:34.843 --> 00:42:36.624]  Now they have their spy grid in place.
[00:42:36.624 --> 00:42:39.445]  This is really happening, like history shows it would.
[00:42:39.445 --> 00:42:40.365]  Well, you're really a hero.
[00:42:40.365 --> 00:42:43.586]  I know you don't want to hear that, but you really are a hero, and you've been vindicated and everything.
[00:42:43.586 --> 00:42:45.647]  You're a real class act, William Binning.

[00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:41.855]  It's coming out that these FBI agents that are having to leave the whole fake Mueller investigation didn't just exonerate Hillary and cover up for her when her and her aides lied, but they praised DOJ official after defying Trump travel ban
[00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:58.245]  But the Supreme Court has now again completely authorized, and of course we knew that would happen, it's clear in law, but I've got a bunch of news on that front right now.
[00:47:58.245 --> 00:48:06.048]  The first thing I want to get at here though is that this Mueller thing is completely transparent.
[00:48:07.523 --> 00:48:18.137]  And that's why the media now goes into this whole hoax mode of fake news that Trump got caught working with the Russians during the campaign and Flynn's going to testify to it because it's all they've got and they did that on purpose.
[00:48:18.137 --> 00:48:19.058]  So you've got to know.
[00:48:20.236 --> 00:48:30.418]  They did that on purpose to test it, to see if folks bought it, and then to suspend their head investigator, who's famous for doing that stuff, for four weeks, to gauge it.
[00:48:30.418 --> 00:48:32.499]  They're testing right now.
[00:48:32.499 --> 00:48:47.322]  And so, get ready for some other whoppers, because a lot of psychological studies show, you put big enough lies like that out, it just creates the perception, even if people find out it's not true, it still gives those that want to buy into it a subconscious hope.
[00:48:48.626 --> 00:48:52.028]  It's very, very delusional behavior.
[00:48:52.028 --> 00:48:58.773]  But they're getting ready with the indictment for obstruction, so they need to kind of have that background out there.
[00:48:58.773 --> 00:49:03.376]  Now, I didn't cover this a few days ago when they attacked me, because there's a new attack every day.
[00:49:03.376 --> 00:49:06.719]  But Newsweek and everything else put out lies about yours truly.
[00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:12.691]  Because Media Matters, run by George Soros, put out a story attacking me.
[00:49:12.691 --> 00:49:17.613]  So when they do that, all the other minions go, oh, our boss said do this, let's follow it.
[00:49:17.613 --> 00:49:26.117]  And they said that I put out a vile anti-lesbian rant, where I said lesbians want to eat people's brains.
[00:49:26.117 --> 00:49:26.897]  Uh, no.
[00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:36.142]  I said, then you've got the rich executive types, like Fifty Shades of Grey, that want to torture you, they trick you into a bondage setting, and then they torture you.
[00:49:36.142 --> 00:49:36.822]  I was talking about
[00:49:38.152 --> 00:49:43.314]  The whole bondage situation where people end up getting in bad situations when they get tied up.
[00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:45.115]  So I was mixing the two things together.
[00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:49.097]  I don't hate anybody if they're gay or lesbian or any of that, but it's a fact!
[00:49:50.267 --> 00:49:58.131]  That in the gay or straight bondage movement, if you study criminology, not just here but in Europe, it's really bad in England and really bad in Germany.
[00:49:58.131 --> 00:50:03.815]  Like one of the main guys in the Scorpions said, no, I've been to parties and clubs where they kill people.
[00:50:03.815 --> 00:50:05.215]  And folks, they do.
[00:50:05.215 --> 00:50:06.696]  And it's coming out.
[00:50:06.696 --> 00:50:07.757]  Gay, straight, you name it.
[00:50:07.757 --> 00:50:09.698]  I'm just saying bad stuff.
[00:50:09.698 --> 00:50:14.100]  So the media then edits that together to make it sound like I'm saying lesbians are eating brains.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.782]  No, I said globalist devil worshippers and stuff like that.
[00:50:18.302 --> 00:50:21.803]  And there's been cases of psychopaths that do eat people's brains while they're alive.
[00:50:21.803 --> 00:50:25.744]  Like, who was the guy up in Milwaukee?
[00:50:25.744 --> 00:50:26.685]  Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:50:26.685 --> 00:50:29.886]  So, that's how desperate fake news is.
[00:50:29.886 --> 00:50:33.207]  InfoWars host Jones' vile anti-lesbian rant.
[00:50:33.207 --> 00:50:36.788]  Jones impersonates a liberal lesbian eating brains.
[00:50:38.632 --> 00:50:39.993]  Well, they got a problem.
[00:50:39.993 --> 00:50:46.439]  Somebody else put out fake news about it, about when I talked about it, and they got it right but also wrong.
[00:50:46.439 --> 00:50:55.688]  Alex Jones' Harvey Weinstein comments are vile beyond belief, where I talk about how they train you to get tied up like Fifty Shades of Grey, but then you end up getting tortured and killed.
[00:50:56.485 --> 00:51:06.036]  You go to California, you're there, you're gonna be a crack whore, and they're done using you, they're gonna put you in a snuff film for European consumption, and they're gonna torture you to death.
[00:51:06.036 --> 00:51:07.938]  I'm talking about general evil.
[00:51:07.938 --> 00:51:09.760]  Heterosexual, homosexual, you name it.
[00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:15.553]  And then here it is, studies that prove domestic violence is LGBT issue.
[00:51:15.553 --> 00:51:20.878]  The part about lesbians was about most studies show they have the highest levels of domestic abuse.
[00:51:20.878 --> 00:51:22.320]  It's just what it's in the news.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.523]  So it's not just like men hurt women or vice versa.
[00:51:25.523 --> 00:51:28.125]  It's that this goes on with women too.
[00:51:28.125 --> 00:51:29.226]  Women aren't perfect.
[00:51:29.226 --> 00:51:32.569]  Let's all stop bashing each other and just realize the facts.
[00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:34.111]  Now, the reason I raise all that
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.866]  And here it is, Soros Fund Manager Rape Beat Playboy Models $27 million lawsuit.
[00:51:39.866 --> 00:51:41.748]  Soros Fund Manager blah blah blah.
[00:51:41.748 --> 00:51:45.793]  You have this other group, branding women, using women to recruit them.
[00:51:45.793 --> 00:51:53.202]  And you had Hollywood star females that were second in command, former Smithville actress second in command in sex cult.
[00:51:53.202 --> 00:51:53.802]  Torture cult.
[00:51:54.683 --> 00:51:56.504]  I mean, I'm just reading the stuff.
[00:51:56.504 --> 00:51:59.466]  Hollywood actresses, sex slavery, enslaving other women.
[00:51:59.466 --> 00:52:04.568]  I'm just telling you, this is what's at the bottom of the barrel is men and women torturing people.
[00:52:04.568 --> 00:52:06.509]  Lesbian women, straight women.
[00:52:06.509 --> 00:52:07.850]  Gay men, straight men.
[00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:09.011]  It's going on.
[00:52:09.011 --> 00:52:10.471]  It's happening.
[00:52:10.471 --> 00:52:12.232]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:52:12.232 --> 00:52:15.694]  And then it'll be, Jones went back to attacking the lesbians again!
[00:52:15.694 --> 00:52:18.015]  Yes, there are lesbians that do bad things.
[00:52:18.015 --> 00:52:20.116]  There are straight people that do bad things.
[00:52:20.116 --> 00:52:20.857]  I'm sick of it.
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:25.984]  Everybody knows I'm not on some kick against lesbians or anybody else.
[00:52:25.984 --> 00:52:27.445]  I'd be a big hypocrite if I wasn't.
[00:52:27.445 --> 00:52:27.985]  I like women.
[00:52:27.985 --> 00:52:29.607]  I get it.
[00:52:29.607 --> 00:52:38.495]  So the point is, is that now there's this story on Infowars.com and Newswars.com that just broke.
[00:52:38.495 --> 00:52:39.556]  Hashtag me too.
[00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:42.698]  Female singer accused of rape by former colleague.
[00:52:43.712 --> 00:52:48.315]  It's moment of reckoning coming for female predators.
[00:52:48.315 --> 00:53:00.604]  And folks, I see the police reports the news, but it's always back of the paper, or I know folks it happens to, where you get the butch chick, and then she beats up the non-butch chick.
[00:53:00.604 --> 00:53:02.586]  And, you know, smacks her around and rapes her.
[00:53:02.586 --> 00:53:04.247]  And that's what's being reported here.
[00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:11.653]  Singer Melanie Martinez has been accused, again that's allegedly going on here, of rape by former colleague.
[00:53:12.628 --> 00:53:18.533]  Suggesting that Me Too reckoning is also coming for female predators in the entertainment industry.
[00:53:18.533 --> 00:53:30.443]  Musician Timothy Heller accused Martinez of raping a tweet on Tuesday morning in which included a detailed story, and it's a woman that goes by Timothy Heller, about how the abuse began and the unspecified date.
[00:53:30.443 --> 00:53:34.146]  And kept hitting on her, kept grabbing on her, and then finally raped her, reportedly.
[00:53:34.963 --> 00:53:36.304]  Now, who knows if that's true or not?
[00:53:36.304 --> 00:53:38.327]  You know, if I question it, now I condone rape.
[00:53:38.327 --> 00:53:41.971]  No, I mean, about half the rape allegations you hear out there end up to be fake.
[00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:44.573]  That's well known in criminology as well.
[00:53:44.573 --> 00:53:45.675]  Does it lessen the real rape?
[00:53:45.675 --> 00:53:51.281]  No, but it turned out the whole lacrosse thing, raping the black lady, was fake.
[00:53:51.281 --> 00:53:53.663]  It's just, this is how people get attention.
[00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:55.025]  I'm not saying this isn't real.
[00:53:56.203 --> 00:53:58.144]  Because it kind of fits the whole MO.
[00:53:58.144 --> 00:53:59.884]  But we don't know.
[00:53:59.884 --> 00:54:14.890]  I'm just getting at the fact that that story is up on Infowars.com, and the Huffington Post got it right that I talked about people like Harvey Weinstein in Hollywood end up getting women into bondage, and a lot of times when they finally get them tied up the fourth or fifth time, sometimes they never come back.
[00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:18.311]  And I told you that back before it had come out, he'd raped women, reportedly.
[00:54:18.311 --> 00:54:21.192]  I'm not saying he's doing it, I'm saying that type of stuff goes on.
[00:54:21.192 --> 00:54:23.233]  So that was the same thing I broke down.
[00:54:23.233 --> 00:54:25.514]  They say, oh, he said a horrible thing about Harvey Weinstein.
[00:54:27.096 --> 00:54:35.101]  Which wasn't even true, but at least they got the quote that it was about men, Fifty Shades of Grey stuff, being training for kidnapping women, and for getting women in bad positions.
[00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:43.767]  So look out, men or women, don't go into dungeons with people you think you know, even four or five times, and then get chained up on the fifth time.
[00:54:43.767 --> 00:54:54.535]  That's what psychopaths do, and a lot of people come up missing because of that, and movies like Fifty Shades of Grey and the accompanying books have popularized a whole new launch of this, and many women are going on Craigslist
[00:54:54.975 --> 00:55:00.239]  And on these other hookup sites, and are going and meeting men they don't even know to get tied up!
[00:55:00.239 --> 00:55:03.381]  That's not a good idea!
[00:55:03.381 --> 00:55:07.785]  And yes, it's mainly men doing it to women.
[00:55:07.785 --> 00:55:10.247]  It's also butch women doing it to men.
[00:55:10.247 --> 00:55:11.788]  I'm just giving you the MO.
[00:55:11.788 --> 00:55:14.090]  And it's gay men doing it to gay men.
[00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:17.712]  But the point is, you're crazy if you go into one of these dungeons.
[00:55:17.712 --> 00:55:18.973]  You're nuts.
[00:55:18.973 --> 00:55:20.735]  Because it's all about, like, pedophilia.
[00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:33.701]  First, they want to make contact with your kid, and then they want to test him and touch him a little, so if the kid reports that they can deny it, it's a feeder into a very dark, evil, twisted underworld.
[00:55:33.701 --> 00:55:40.448]  It's very, very satanic, and you don't want to get involved in it, young people or anybody else, okay?
[00:55:42.707 --> 00:55:49.269]  I mean, I remember like 15 years ago, my family has a long time gay friend that I've known since I was a kid.
[00:55:49.269 --> 00:56:03.573]  He died a few years ago, and he was a newspaper reporter, stuff like that, and I heard, you know, when he got into a bunch of stuff before he died, you know, this whole wild scene or whatever, and he was an older guy, that he was going to stuff like this and got hurt.
[00:56:04.973 --> 00:56:13.901]  So, the point is, ladies and gentlemen, this is real stuff, and this whole bondage thing isn't cute, it isn't funny, and Hollywood sells you it's sexy and it's cool.
[00:56:13.901 --> 00:56:18.926]  You got 13-year-old girls reading stuff like, uh, Fifty Shades of Grey.
[00:56:18.926 --> 00:56:20.868]  It's a load of garbage.
[00:56:22.617 --> 00:56:27.701]  All of it is hateful and bad and leads into a very, very evil place.
[00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:32.184]  Anything beyond... If your wife likes you, slap her on the rear end a couple times.
[00:56:32.184 --> 00:56:35.066]  I think anything beyond that is evil.
[00:56:35.066 --> 00:56:36.547]  And it's bad.
[00:56:36.547 --> 00:56:38.769]  And... I'm just warning you, and I'm done.
[00:56:38.769 --> 00:56:42.071]  They'll say that's an anti-lesbian thing, because they want you to stay in it.
[00:56:42.071 --> 00:56:44.353]  They want fresh meat, they want to hurt you.
[00:56:44.353 --> 00:56:46.114]  The whole globalist satanic combine.
[00:56:46.114 --> 00:56:47.295]  So you've been warned.
[00:56:47.295 --> 00:56:48.075]  You've been warned.
[00:56:48.075 --> 00:56:50.557]  Now, I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:56:50.557 --> 00:56:51.238]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:56:52.307 --> 00:56:53.588]  We need financial support.
[00:56:53.588 --> 00:56:54.489]  We're the tip of the spear.
[00:56:54.489 --> 00:56:55.549]  You just heard William Binney.
[00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:56.970]  That is super exclusive.
[00:56:56.970 --> 00:56:58.391]  Destroying the entire Russia deal.
[00:56:58.391 --> 00:56:59.512]  It was a setup.
[00:56:59.512 --> 00:57:01.874]  They have the total proof.
[00:57:01.874 --> 00:57:07.118]  We're bringing you a guy first, years ago, who the president has go meet with the CIA director.
[00:57:07.118 --> 00:57:09.019]  I mean, we're bringing you the hardcore folks.
[00:57:09.019 --> 00:57:11.801]  We got free shipping on a lot of items, not store-wide.
[00:57:11.801 --> 00:57:17.285]  50% off on the high-quality fluoride-free toothpaste with coital, silver, and iodine.
[00:57:17.285 --> 00:57:18.105]  Super blue, amazing.
[00:57:18.105 --> 00:57:20.067]  And the mouthwash for adults and children.
[00:57:21.343 --> 00:57:24.604]  We have DNA Force, 33% off, back in stock.
[00:57:24.604 --> 00:57:25.925]  And we have a lot of other stuff.
[00:57:25.925 --> 00:57:29.146]  And we have a new website that I haven't even told you about.
[00:57:29.146 --> 00:57:32.887]  When I come back, I'll briefly tell you about it before we hand the baton to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:57:32.887 --> 00:57:40.770]  But if you want to commit and get high quality, great products that have changed my life and so many others, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:44.952]  And we got 50% off of Vitamin Mineral Fusion Fruit Punch as well.
[00:57:44.952 --> 00:57:47.212]  You owe it to yourself and your family to get these high quality products.
[00:57:49.033 --> 00:57:52.637]  The new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:57:52.637 --> 00:57:57.403]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:57:57.403 --> 00:58:06.093]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:58:06.093 --> 00:58:09.337]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[00:58:09.597 --> 00:58:14.821]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:58:14.821 --> 00:58:22.146]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:58:22.146 --> 00:58:26.049]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:58:26.049 --> 00:58:30.772]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:58:30.772 --> 00:58:34.815]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a
[00:58:34.855 --> 00:58:36.156]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[00:58:36.156 --> 00:58:40.598]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[00:58:40.598 --> 00:58:41.599]  So what do we do about it?
[00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:43.980]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[00:59:04.793 --> 00:59:12.539]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.

[01:00:07.578 --> 01:00:12.385]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:12.385 --> 01:00:14.087]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:14.087 --> 01:00:15.769]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:15.769 --> 01:00:21.817]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.817 --> 01:00:24.381]  I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:26.499 --> 01:00:37.841]  And I want to specifically ask you, the listeners, we're starting to really turn the tide and have some big victories of nationalism, of productivity, of prosperity for the average person, the cornucopia of the free market.
[01:00:37.841 --> 01:00:39.242]  The globalists don't like that, obviously.
[01:00:39.242 --> 01:00:41.702]  How are they going to counter-strike?
[01:00:41.702 --> 01:00:46.143]  What do you expect them to do, claiming Trump's involved in a coup, so they've got to remove him?
[01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:53.244]  See, that's what they're doing, but they turn it around, so when they engage in it, they claim they're stopping a dictator, when there's no evidence of that.
[01:00:53.244 --> 01:00:54.425]  What do you think they're going to pull?
[01:00:54.425 --> 01:00:55.845]  What do you think they've got up their sleeve?
[01:00:56.633 --> 01:00:58.434]  What do they got in their back pocket?
[01:00:58.434 --> 01:00:59.714]  What's the race in the hole?
[01:01:14.346 --> 01:01:16.127]  And there's over 30 big things it does.
[01:01:16.127 --> 01:01:18.948]  It's just dizzying.
[01:01:18.948 --> 01:01:20.189]  Is Trump not real?
[01:01:20.189 --> 01:01:21.610]  He does some things I don't like.
[01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:23.571]  But he really is the president.
[01:01:23.571 --> 01:01:26.252]  He really is returning power back to our nation.
[01:01:26.252 --> 01:01:27.253]  It really is a big deal.
[01:01:27.253 --> 01:01:30.935]  And we've got so many other big stories we're going to cover in the next segment.
[01:01:30.935 --> 01:01:34.076]  But first I want to play this piece here.
[01:01:34.076 --> 01:01:37.118]  Dems lead delusional uprising over possible Mueller firing.
[01:01:38.881 --> 01:01:48.346]  Voices of blind hypocrisy want Americans to know that we should ignore all of the overwhelming evidence of a fabricated witch hunt against President Trump.
[01:01:48.346 --> 01:02:01.112]  Instead, join them in their flabbergasted disgust that anyone would even consider ending Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia-White House collusion fiction.
[01:02:01.112 --> 01:02:05.454]  Mr. President, I rise today concerned about the threats
[01:02:06.454 --> 01:02:13.696]  The special counsel's critical investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
[01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:25.780]  Over the last several weeks, a growing chorus of irresponsible and reckless voices have called for President Trump to shut down special counsel Mueller's investigation.
[01:02:27.256 --> 01:02:33.698]  At first, these calls came from the fringes of our political discourse.
[01:02:33.698 --> 01:02:40.100]  Those who would refuse to put our country and our security before base political instincts.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.161]  Yeah, none of this is true.
[01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:41.841]  Earlier this year.
[01:02:42.987 --> 01:02:56.134]  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were right to push back on his misdirected calls and urge that the special counsel be allowed to do his job without interference.
[01:02:56.134 --> 01:03:02.317]  Yeah, that means let him violate the law, let him do whatever he wants, don't talk back to him, he's God.
[01:03:02.317 --> 01:03:05.119]  ...seem to be growing in stridency and involvement.
[01:03:05.119 --> 01:03:07.160]  No, what's growing is he's discredited, he's been caught red-handed.
[01:03:08.138 --> 01:03:08.438]  Oh, but...
[01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:25.552]  From the beginning.
[01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:30.277]  I sat through a Judiciary Committee hearing that I thought was disgraceful.
[01:03:30.277 --> 01:03:39.166]  With members on the other side of the aisle trying to smear not only FBI Director Christopher Wray, but also... I mean, we can beat these guys.
[01:03:39.166 --> 01:03:40.387]  These are wimps.
[01:03:40.387 --> 01:03:41.688]  Trying to play dictator.
[01:03:41.688 --> 01:03:43.790]  You're not going to stop our prosperity.
[01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:45.192]  You're not running our lives anymore.
[01:03:45.192 --> 01:03:46.533]  You're not getting our guns, Phil.
[01:03:48.775 --> 01:03:59.840]  Wait till you see what happens if the President actually tries to take these unconstitutional and what would really amount to criminal actions because he would be obstructing justice.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:14.307]  But ever since he whipped up chants of Lock Her Up in the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump has displayed complete ignorance of the difference between a constitutional democracy and a banana republic.
[01:04:15.327 --> 01:04:18.769]  Yeah, they want to kill Trump, lock him up for no reason.
[01:04:18.769 --> 01:04:21.690]  We just say, Hillary for president, lock her up, and then we're the bad guys.
[01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:22.391]  Blair in fantasy land?
[01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:23.911]  Or in a magical kingdom, like in your hair?
[01:04:40.936 --> 01:04:43.939]  What's that Dr. Seuss book where they live in somebody's hair?
[01:04:43.939 --> 01:04:46.142]  It's a whole universe?
[01:04:46.142 --> 01:04:52.008]  Someone please show me a Democrat not politicizing every aspect of- We'll be right back.
[01:04:52.008 --> 01:04:52.789]  Good job, John Bowden.
[01:04:56.152 --> 01:05:11.560]  Hey, if you want to slow down your aging process and protect your heart and brain from constant exposure to harmful toxins, then you need DNA Force, the most complete, full-spectrum, age-defying, cell-protecting formula in the world.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.541]  DNA Force is designed to help
[01:05:13.541 --> 01:05:15.742]  Yeah, you like the sound of that?
[01:05:15.742 --> 01:05:17.804]  And now, just in time for Christmas,
[01:05:40.077 --> 01:05:40.577]  Big Brother.
[01:06:05.919 --> 01:06:08.220]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:11.281]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:11.281 --> 01:06:13.202]  You want answers?
[01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:15.103]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:15.103 --> 01:06:21.406]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.325 --> 01:06:28.327]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, maybe even sooner, I'm going to take your phone calls on Trump's first year.
[01:06:28.327 --> 01:06:31.408]  Because he hit the ground running as president-elect.
[01:06:31.408 --> 01:06:35.670]  So, I'd say it's about a year now, even though January 20th is when he got in officially.
[01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:40.732]  November, you know, 8th is when he got, uh, became president-elect.
[01:06:40.732 --> 01:06:41.612]  But he hit the ground running.
[01:06:41.612 --> 01:06:46.574]  So I'd say right about now, Trump has been president for a year.
[01:06:46.574 --> 01:06:47.694]  Because he did hit the ground running.
[01:06:47.694 --> 01:06:49.575]  He understood times of the essence.
[01:06:49.575 --> 01:06:51.476]  He couldn't let the economy stall out.
[01:06:51.476 --> 01:06:52.336]  First thing he did,
[01:06:53.609 --> 01:07:03.914]  Before he even got his government organized was make thousands of phone calls telling corporations he was going to cut taxes and please invest in America or the whole thing's going to go belly up.
[01:07:03.914 --> 01:07:07.275]  Then he called and thanked people politically for what they'd done.
[01:07:07.275 --> 01:07:08.456]  Myself and others.
[01:07:08.456 --> 01:07:09.276]  Thousands.
[01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:09.997]  Thousands.
[01:07:09.997 --> 01:07:12.778]  He's a titanous workhorse.
[01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:18.821]  And then he called world leaders and people and started talking to them and doing diplomatic stuff.
[01:07:19.907 --> 01:07:22.129]  And that's all on record what the President did.
[01:07:22.129 --> 01:07:23.609]  First, stabilize the economy.
[01:07:23.609 --> 01:07:25.551]  Emergency, emergency, emergency.
[01:07:25.551 --> 01:07:27.732]  Then thank the people that helped.
[01:07:27.732 --> 01:07:30.514]  Then start dealing with the rest of the world.
[01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:31.955]  First, stabilize the ship.
[01:07:31.955 --> 01:07:40.400]  America first, America first, America first, America first.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.582]  And now, a year later.
[01:07:43.582 --> 01:07:45.143]  Trump's been in a year now.
[01:07:45.143 --> 01:07:48.726]  And this is a fair time to average all the stuff he did.
[01:07:49.793 --> 01:07:58.776]  As president-elect, when he officially became president, he's been a president a year, and how has he done?
[01:07:58.776 --> 01:08:01.277]  What do you think about the situation?
[01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.197]  What are the pluses?
[01:08:02.197 --> 01:08:02.977]  What are the minuses?
[01:08:02.977 --> 01:08:07.079]  But just remember, he's not God.
[01:08:07.079 --> 01:08:08.639]  He can't get it all done.
[01:08:08.639 --> 01:08:10.440]  I'm surprised how much he's gotten done.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.681]  It's been miraculous.
[01:08:12.681 --> 01:08:15.762]  And they said he'd never get the tax cuts through, on and on and on.
[01:08:15.762 --> 01:08:17.923]  And they played all the race games.
[01:08:17.923 --> 01:08:19.063]  There's new statistics out.
[01:08:20.618 --> 01:08:47.476]  And it's not that Hispanics that make up something like 70% of immigrants coming to the country are inherently criminal, it's that there is a contingent already fleeing justice, like Americans fleeing to Mexico and vice versa, that don't have real names, have fake IDs that the Mexican consulate will give them, all these corrupt state governments and local governments will give them IDs, and they are just above the law, and they mainly feed, if you look at the statistics, on other Hispanics.
[01:08:51.226 --> 01:08:57.089]  I'm going to go to some new statistics in a moment with Tucker Carlson breaking that down, but Jorge Ramos.
[01:08:57.089 --> 01:09:02.672]  I mean, I can't go to Mexico and then go have a baby for free and have it taken care of.
[01:09:02.672 --> 01:09:04.072]  They'd laugh at me.
[01:09:04.072 --> 01:09:09.795]  I can't go to Mexico and just do whatever I want, especially if I'm not working.
[01:09:09.795 --> 01:09:14.558]  Mexico gets illegal aliens from Latin America and gives them six months to a year hard labor and tortures them.
[01:09:14.558 --> 01:09:16.819]  That's the Leningradian, and I'm not defending that.
[01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:22.003]  The point is, acting like America is the worst thing on earth is not true.
[01:09:22.003 --> 01:09:29.210]  And then the Democrats try to turn Hispanics particularly into a new racial group and make it race-based politics.
[01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:30.811]  And that's failing.
[01:09:30.811 --> 01:09:34.194]  And that's good news for everybody.
[01:09:34.194 --> 01:09:38.238]  So, Jorge Ramos says he's now having the worst time of his life in the U.S.
[01:09:38.238 --> 01:09:42.242]  With Donald Trump there, I have never been treated so badly.
[01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:45.344]  I've never been insulted so much.
[01:09:45.344 --> 01:09:47.385]  We've never been attacked so much.
[01:09:47.385 --> 01:09:55.628]  They have never tried to run us out as much as now, Ramos vented in an interview with the Spanish radio network.
[01:09:55.628 --> 01:10:07.433]  Ramos, who claimed himself as not the enemy, but an opponent of Trump in the interview, complained about the massive blowback he's received since deciding to use his media platform to openly oppose the choice
[01:10:09.457 --> 01:10:12.499]  Over 62 million Americans who voted last year's election.
[01:10:12.499 --> 01:10:14.460]  Then he complains about social networks.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:19.242]  The social networks are 10 to 1 against libertarians, nationalists, and conservatives.
[01:10:19.242 --> 01:10:20.983]  But we know most of them are bots.
[01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:21.564]  We know it's fake.
[01:10:21.564 --> 01:10:23.384]  So we don't care if we get ridiculed.
[01:10:23.384 --> 01:10:24.685]  We keep hammering back.
[01:10:24.685 --> 01:10:31.529]  But everybody knows the Democrats, the globalists, the liberals are way more threatening, way more hateful, constantly calling for violence.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:46.103]  And then, when Kate Stanley gets shot in the back, and the virtue signaling, mainly white jury, lets the guy who'd been deported, what, five times, and committed all these crimes, lets him go!
[01:10:46.103 --> 01:10:47.524]  Not even manslaughter!
[01:10:47.524 --> 01:10:51.445]  Not even accidental!
[01:10:51.445 --> 01:10:55.826]  Because they couldn't signal that it was wrong to shoot her in the back.
[01:10:56.906 --> 01:10:57.507]  What about Kate?
[01:10:57.507 --> 01:11:04.873]  Well, signs were put up at the university there in San Francisco and folks pulled them down and said, this is racist.
[01:11:04.873 --> 01:11:06.335]  All it said was, she had dreams too.
[01:11:06.335 --> 01:11:08.296]  Like, she's a human too.
[01:11:08.296 --> 01:11:09.417]  She has rights too.
[01:11:09.417 --> 01:11:16.243]  But then Nancy Pelosi virtue signals and says, illegal migrants embody the best of our nation.
[01:11:16.243 --> 01:11:22.029]  Not migrants, not people coming here to work, not people coming here to be Americans, but migrants, which means illegals.
[01:11:24.764 --> 01:11:30.186]  Illegal migrants embody the best of our nation, says the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.
[01:11:31.172 --> 01:11:41.274]  The flattery of illegals came December 21st as Pelosi urged the House Committee on Rules that included amnesty for 3.25 million dreamer illegals in two-week budget resolution.
[01:11:41.274 --> 01:11:44.375]  The problem is most of those folks are 40 years old with fake names.
[01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:45.295]  They're not really dreamers.
[01:11:45.295 --> 01:11:54.197]  It's kind of like the Islamicist, where you got 30-year-old and 25-year-old men in Dutch, Swedish, and German schools, because they say they're 16.
[01:11:57.486 --> 01:12:04.191]  And then she goes on to say, they embody the best of our nation's patriotism, hard work, perseverance, Pelosi said of the dreamers.
[01:12:04.191 --> 01:12:08.675]  She added that Congress shouldn't leave them to celebrate the holidays in fear.
[01:12:08.675 --> 01:12:09.135]  Oh really?
[01:12:09.135 --> 01:12:11.937]  What about Kate Stanley?
[01:12:11.937 --> 01:12:18.142]  Meanwhile, so it was terrorism, attacker who rammed his car into victims upset at mistreatment of Muslims.
[01:12:20.024 --> 01:12:25.186]  And of course, you've had hundreds of these attacks the last few years in Russia, Europe, here, all over.
[01:12:25.186 --> 01:12:27.808]  And most of the time, they'll never even say it's Islamicist.
[01:12:27.808 --> 01:12:31.529]  In fact, in Sweden and in other areas, they won't release the name.
[01:12:31.529 --> 01:12:38.833]  They've passed laws and regulations saying it's racist if the guy's name is Habib or Hammamad or Ahmed or whatever.
[01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:40.393]  It's just incredible.
[01:12:40.393 --> 01:12:43.995]  So that story's up on NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:12:43.995 --> 01:12:45.416]  From Paul, Joseph Watson.
[01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:46.236]  Please hear it out to everybody.
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:55.266]  Meanwhile, Morris, he comes out, more of a classical liberal, and says, fake news media get angry if you say something that reflects the will of Europe.
[01:12:55.266 --> 01:13:04.632]  Yeah, they're saying it's racist to want to have vetted people coming into the country when all the globalists are doing is openly erasing people's cultures.
[01:13:04.632 --> 01:13:15.240]  Now, let's go to the Tucker Carlson piece, where they break down these statistics, never-before-seen statistics proving illegal aliens commit massively disproportionate amount of crime.
[01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:25.242]  This evening we've got brand new numbers, striking numbers that have never been seen before and they may reshape how you think about illegal immigration.
[01:13:25.242 --> 01:13:27.063]  So you've heard the same line a million times.
[01:13:27.063 --> 01:13:30.787]  It's repeated like a mantra by the left during every debate on the subject.
[01:13:31.467 --> 01:13:34.048]  All immigrants are hard-working and law-abiding.
[01:13:34.048 --> 01:13:37.889]  They do jobs you wouldn't consider doing, and they do them cheerfully.
[01:13:37.889 --> 01:13:41.190]  They sacrifice for their families in ways you probably don't.
[01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:54.815]  In fact, and this is always the last point, it's always delivered with the confident satisfaction of someone shutting down a debate with superior data, undocumented immigrants actually commit fewer crimes on average than native-born Americans.
[01:13:55.635 --> 01:13:59.720]  Not only are immigrants more virtuous than you are, but they're safer to be around.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.702]  In other words, stop complaining!
[01:14:01.702 --> 01:14:04.084]  They're your superiors.
[01:14:04.084 --> 01:14:07.568]  But wait, are we sure that that is true?
[01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:16.218]  Are people who are in this country precisely because they were willing to break our immigration laws really less likely to break other kinds of laws?
[01:14:17.492 --> 01:14:19.833]  Doesn't make a lot of sense.
[01:14:19.833 --> 01:14:26.215]  Yet until today, strangely enough, no one could say for sure whether it was true.
[01:14:26.215 --> 01:14:29.776]  Because reliable statistics didn't seem to exist.
[01:14:29.776 --> 01:14:33.618]  Our government tracks pretty much every trend and every phenomenon you can think of.
[01:14:33.618 --> 01:14:40.320]  From how many pounds of pistachio nuts are recalled every year, to how many 5th graders are injured on swing sets, how many people die in bathtubs.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.902]  This is a nation of record keepers.
[01:14:41.902 --> 01:14:45.486]  We're overseen by an army of spreadsheet-wielding bureaucrats.
[01:14:45.486 --> 01:14:47.148]  Numbers control our lives.
[01:14:47.148 --> 01:14:48.810]  Except on this subject.
[01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:56.960]  Somehow, the government went for years without honestly trying to track the volume of crime committed by illegal immigrants in this country.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.702]  Maybe they were too incompetent to do it.
[01:14:59.302 --> 01:15:02.945]  More likely, they didn't want you to know the answer, or to think about it even.
[01:15:02.945 --> 01:15:06.847]  In any case, we now for the first time have the actual numbers, and here they are.
[01:15:06.847 --> 01:15:08.528]  According to statistics from the U.S.
[01:15:08.528 --> 01:15:15.513]  Sentencing Commission, non-citizens are actually far more likely to commit serious crimes than Americans are.
[01:15:15.513 --> 01:15:21.317]  Non-citizens account for 22%, more than a fifth, of all federal murder convictions.
[01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:22.378]  You know what, let's stop right here.
[01:15:23.238 --> 01:15:24.880]  Let's back this up about 30 seconds.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.261]  I'm going to come back and break this down.
[01:15:26.261 --> 01:15:30.684]  And the reason I knew this was the statistics were already there.
[01:15:30.684 --> 01:15:42.953]  Hispanic immigrants on average have a low crime rate, but there is a minority subgroup of hardened criminals that commit hugely disproportionate amounts of crime because they can't be tracked.
[01:15:42.953 --> 01:15:44.534]  That's why you have this anomaly.
[01:15:44.534 --> 01:15:46.355]  We'll explain it on the other side.
[01:15:46.355 --> 01:15:49.037]  Both sides of this are actually true.
[01:15:49.037 --> 01:15:49.438]  Stay with us.
[01:15:55.353 --> 01:16:01.875]  KD Armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market, and we've succeeded.

[01:16:56.983 --> 01:16:59.444]  ID Stronghold wallets are different.
[01:16:59.444 --> 01:17:01.284]  They may look the same on the outside.
[01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:02.045]  They're stylish.
[01:17:02.045 --> 01:17:03.705]  They'll hold your cards and cash.
[01:17:03.705 --> 01:17:06.686]  But they're hiding something great on the inside.
[01:17:06.686 --> 01:17:08.927]  No, there are no pyrotechnics.
[01:17:08.927 --> 01:17:11.307]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.
[01:17:11.307 --> 01:17:13.968]  But it does have magical powers.

[01:17:56.425 --> 01:17:58.286]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:17:58.286 --> 01:17:59.606]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:17:59.606 --> 01:18:00.827]  Why is this so good?
[01:18:00.827 --> 01:18:06.109]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:06.109 --> 01:18:19.655]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:18:19.655 --> 01:18:21.016]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:18:21.776 --> 01:18:23.437]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:18:23.437 --> 01:18:26.017]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:18:26.017 --> 01:18:27.318]  These are all parasites.
[01:18:27.318 --> 01:18:28.418]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:18:28.418 --> 01:18:29.758]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:29.758 --> 01:18:34.260]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:37.521]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:18:37.521 --> 01:18:40.602]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:18:40.602 --> 01:18:41.642]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:18:41.642 --> 01:18:43.563]  LivingDefense, InfowarsLife.com.
[01:18:43.563 --> 01:18:44.603]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:18:44.603 --> 01:18:47.304]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:18:47.304 --> 01:18:47.424]  And...
[01:18:48.184 --> 01:18:49.206]  You support the broadcast.
[01:18:49.206 --> 01:18:50.568]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:18:50.568 --> 01:18:52.811]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:18:52.811 --> 01:18:54.774]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:18:55.993 --> 01:19:00.416]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:08.502]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:19:08.502 --> 01:19:13.786]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:19:13.786 --> 01:19:16.328]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:19:16.328 --> 01:19:20.551]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:19:20.551 --> 01:19:22.993]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:19:23.653 --> 01:19:30.897]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:19:30.897 --> 01:19:38.961]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:19:38.961 --> 01:19:46.164]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:19:46.164 --> 01:19:47.605]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:19:47.605 --> 01:19:49.426]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:50.246 --> 01:19:53.710]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:59.375]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:01.978]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.357 --> 01:20:22.859]  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us.
[01:20:22.859 --> 01:20:24.001]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:25.603]  Coming up in the next segment, your phone calls.
[01:20:25.603 --> 01:20:28.967]  So continuing here, I'm a newshound.
[01:20:28.967 --> 01:20:30.288]  I've been a newshound for 25 years.
[01:20:30.288 --> 01:20:31.310]  I've been on air 22 years.
[01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:34.934]  And so I actually look at the statistics, and I talk to law enforcement, and I check into it.
[01:20:35.842 --> 01:20:45.667]  And so, that's why I've understood that, statistically, immigrants to this country, from all over the world, come here because they want to work, they want to be successful.
[01:20:45.667 --> 01:20:48.128]  Now, more and more though, you have people coming here to have anchor babies.
[01:20:48.128 --> 01:20:52.771]  So that's now not people from Mexico, that used to be the biggest group, it's now Chinese women.
[01:20:52.771 --> 01:20:59.394]  Thousands and thousands a week come here, middle-class Chinese women, to have their baby for free, then the baby becomes a U.S.
[01:20:59.394 --> 01:21:02.175]  citizen, and now they have a toehold here in the U.S.
[01:21:02.175 --> 01:21:03.136]  We shouldn't have to pay for that.
[01:21:05.049 --> 01:21:19.760]  So again, we know the statistics piece by piece, and on average, the cliche that Hispanic workers out of Mexico, wherever, coming off farms down there, like farm boys used to, you know, come off farms, you know, here in the 50s and 60s.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.001]  They have just been third world.
[01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:23.563]  They haven't been industrialized yet, so they're behind.
[01:21:23.563 --> 01:21:26.306]  Just like my grandfathers were good, hardworking guys that came off the farm.
[01:21:27.259 --> 01:21:31.683]  And, you know, nowadays, you know, people aren't as tough or strong or hard-working as their grandfathers.
[01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:33.304]  We've gotten decadent in America.
[01:21:33.304 --> 01:21:34.465]  So the cliché is true.
[01:21:34.465 --> 01:21:41.210]  Farm boys coming off a farm in Mexico are going to get the job done and usually aren't criminals.
[01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:45.114]  And, you know, they're more country boy than most guys in Texas.
[01:21:45.114 --> 01:21:49.978]  That's where cowboy hats and boots came from Spain and were then developed in Mexico and Chile.
[01:21:51.431 --> 01:22:07.444]  But there is a narco-terrorist culture and a gang culture and a drug culture in Latin America that is a minority, but particularly vicious, that creates a disproportionate amount of crime, and that's true.
[01:22:07.444 --> 01:22:11.006]  Just like black-on-black crime is stratospheric.
[01:22:11.006 --> 01:22:13.708]  These are demographic things that go on and are facts.
[01:22:13.708 --> 01:22:19.373]  So, yes, the average Hispanic person isn't some foaming-at-the-mouth criminal, but
[01:22:20.356 --> 01:22:29.759]  There are criminal gangs coming in, and criminal groups, and mentally ill people, and serial killers, like the railway killer, that killed, they think, forty-something people?
[01:22:29.759 --> 01:22:31.899]  And he had all these different names and stuff?
[01:22:31.899 --> 01:22:33.500]  It's dangerous!
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.360]  And it's crazy!
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:40.782]  I mean, one of these crazy guys shoots a woman in the back, the liberal jury won't even do anything about it!
[01:22:40.782 --> 01:22:42.382]  And that's the issue.
[01:22:42.382 --> 01:22:47.004]  That's what's wrong with this, is that there's this thing where they're making people above the law.
[01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:47.784]  The argument is, well,
[01:22:48.803 --> 01:22:51.144]  People from Latin America already won't call the police.
[01:22:51.144 --> 01:22:53.526]  They're already scared of the system and they're scared of repercussions.
[01:22:53.526 --> 01:22:54.026]  And that's true.
[01:22:54.026 --> 01:22:58.468]  Because in those countries, if you do report on the criminal gangs, they'll kill you.
[01:22:58.468 --> 01:23:01.490]  And that's where the real statistics are.
[01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:07.974]  It's much higher than even these statistics show because Hispanics on average report crime on the lowest levels out there.
[01:23:07.974 --> 01:23:09.054]  You can look it up.
[01:23:09.054 --> 01:23:11.336]  And so a lot of people just get disappeared.
[01:23:11.336 --> 01:23:13.597]  And by the way, who mainly gets disappeared?
[01:23:13.597 --> 01:23:15.418]  Who do gangs usually target mainly?
[01:23:15.418 --> 01:23:16.739]  Their own group.
[01:23:17.737 --> 01:23:23.961]  The worst thing for Hispanics in America are these undocumented criminal gangs, and they'll tell you that.
[01:23:23.961 --> 01:23:29.684]  But you go see a Robert Rodriguez movie, it's rednecks and cowboy hats shooting pregnant Mexicans in the stomach.
[01:23:29.684 --> 01:23:31.965]  Let me tell you who's raping and killing Mexicans.
[01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:36.688]  It's the drug cartels, and they've dug up hundreds of thousands, over 100,000 people.
[01:23:36.688 --> 01:23:39.810]  And almost all of them got killed by those satanic drug gangs.
[01:23:41.547 --> 01:23:42.468]  That's the facts!
[01:23:42.468 --> 01:23:46.311]  Robert Rodriguez, you are a Mexican supremacist racist!
[01:23:46.311 --> 01:23:47.972]  But you're not actually helping your people!
[01:23:47.972 --> 01:23:49.073]  You're not a real supremacist!
[01:23:49.073 --> 01:23:51.114]  You're not telling them don't take Gardasil or whatever!
[01:23:51.114 --> 01:23:53.957]  You're sitting there telling them the gringo's killing them!
[01:23:53.957 --> 01:23:58.860]  When the average gringo is a self-loathing, guilty wimp!
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.682]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:24:00.682 --> 01:24:02.723]  Your problem is not your local gringo!
[01:24:02.723 --> 01:24:04.445]  Your problem is the globalist!
[01:24:04.445 --> 01:24:06.166]  And your problem is Carlos Slim!
[01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:09.489]  And your problem is the big mega-combines that are controlling the society!
[01:24:10.307 --> 01:24:12.589]  And attacking our families and everybody.
[01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:16.873]  And your enemy is the abortuaries that are working as hard as they can to abort your kids.
[01:24:16.873 --> 01:24:19.696]  Am I a leftist trying to get the Hispanic kids aborted?
[01:24:19.696 --> 01:24:20.437]  Hell no!
[01:24:20.437 --> 01:24:21.918]  Am I trying to get the black kids aborted?
[01:24:21.918 --> 01:24:22.559]  No!
[01:24:22.559 --> 01:24:29.185]  Even though they're getting turned into weapons against me by the brainwashing machine, I'm chivalrous and I will not go to that level.
[01:24:29.185 --> 01:24:30.887]  But the real enemy is the globalists.
[01:24:30.887 --> 01:24:32.228]  That's all of our enemy.
[01:24:32.228 --> 01:24:34.811]  And Trump is bringing back prosperity for everybody if we want it.
[01:24:37.409 --> 01:24:52.901]  Now, let's go ahead and play the rest here with Tucker Carlson, and then I'm going to go to break, and I'm going to come back and go to your calls, but I've got to get to some really sickening news that just went live on InfoWars.com with Kit Daniels.
[01:24:52.901 --> 01:24:56.303]  It is so incredible, but I'm not going to tell you about it until the next segment.
[01:24:56.303 --> 01:24:59.986]  Let's finish up with Tucker Carlson and the statistics, and it's worse than this.
[01:24:59.986 --> 01:25:01.127]  It's way worse than this.
[01:25:01.927 --> 01:25:05.509]  I mean, my God, the unmarked graves are digging up.
[01:25:05.509 --> 01:25:18.335]  90% of the time, there is a Hispanic woman, her kids in the grave, and it's because somebody back home didn't pay off, and it's sick, and they're treated like animals by the criminal class in Mexico, and I'm sick of it.
[01:25:18.335 --> 01:25:24.137]  That's why everybody should be armed in Mexico, they should have their own Second Amendment, they should have their own Reformation, and turn this around.
[01:25:24.137 --> 01:25:25.118]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:25:25.558 --> 01:25:28.900]  We now for the first time have the actual numbers, and here they are.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:30.601]  According to statistics from the U.S.
[01:25:30.601 --> 01:25:37.565]  Sentencing Commission, non-citizens are actually far more likely to commit serious crimes than Americans are.
[01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:53.614]  Non-citizens account for 22%, more than a fifth, of all federal murder convictions, 18% of fraud convictions, 33% of money laundering convictions, 29% of drug trafficking convictions, and 72% of convictions for drug possession.
[01:25:54.754 --> 01:25:58.715]  Meanwhile, the non-citizen percentage of the American population?
[01:25:58.715 --> 01:26:00.376]  About 7%.
[01:26:00.376 --> 01:26:03.956]  So that is a massively disproportionate amount of crime.
[01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:05.217]  Not even close.
[01:26:05.217 --> 01:26:09.318]  No, immigrants are not more law-abiding and less dangerous than Americans.
[01:26:09.318 --> 01:26:11.018]  That's totally untrue.
[01:26:11.018 --> 01:26:13.519]  Indeed, it's the opposite of the truth.
[01:26:13.519 --> 01:26:20.021]  Non-citizens are more likely to be arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for serious crimes than people who were born here.
[01:26:20.021 --> 01:26:20.881]  Much more likely.
[01:26:22.021 --> 01:26:24.603]  So why didn't we know this until now?
[01:26:24.603 --> 01:26:29.687]  Why have so many people been lying to us about this for so long?
[01:26:29.687 --> 01:26:32.008]  That's a question we plan to ask a whole bunch of people.
[01:26:41.255 --> 01:26:45.738]  And then I'm going to go to your phone calls for the entire balance of the transmission today, on this Friday edition.
[01:26:45.738 --> 01:26:48.759]  We're going to take hours and hours of phone calls right into the fourth hour.
[01:26:48.759 --> 01:26:55.623]  We got Zack in Morocco, who we'll go to first, our military source on what's happening militarily around the world.
[01:26:55.623 --> 01:26:58.445]  Again, a source known to us, a big news-breaking source.
[01:26:58.445 --> 01:27:01.787]  And I've got the other article, Marine Corps General says we're about to have a big war.
[01:27:01.787 --> 01:27:03.728]  And I know it's in the stack, guys.
[01:27:03.728 --> 01:27:04.909]  Will you just reprint it for me?
[01:27:05.769 --> 01:27:06.890]  Thank you.
[01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:07.810]  So that's coming up.
[01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:13.274]  Just briefly, I want to thank the listeners for all they've done making this broadcast possible.
[01:27:13.274 --> 01:27:15.075]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[01:27:15.075 --> 01:27:17.517]  And you've done it again.
[01:27:17.517 --> 01:27:22.500]  This December was better than last December for our funding.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:26.423]  Not a lot bigger, but the fact that almost everybody else is contracted because last year was an election year.
[01:27:27.639 --> 01:27:35.236]  But that we have expanded, despite all the censorship, all the attacks, getting our sponsors, kicking us off Google Ads, despite all that!
[01:27:36.974 --> 01:27:40.856]  In 2017, we have now brought in more capital than we did in 2016.
[01:27:40.856 --> 01:27:44.078]  I salute you all, and I thank you.
[01:27:44.078 --> 01:27:46.899]  And we just crossed that line a few days ago.
[01:27:46.899 --> 01:28:03.927]  So I will be able to hopefully expand and hire another five, six reporters, more editors, more video people, finish out the new studio, buy more satellite time on TV, and reach out to UHF, VHF, and cable for the big expansion this year into terrestrial television because of all the censorship we're facing on the internet.
[01:28:03.927 --> 01:28:04.708]  So I salute you.
[01:28:05.228 --> 01:28:07.171]  And despite all the attacks, thank you for the prayers.
[01:28:07.171 --> 01:28:11.677]  We made it through it so far by the grace of our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.
[01:28:11.677 --> 01:28:16.844]  So, again, all the praise goes to Christ and all the thanks goes, again, to God.
[01:28:16.844 --> 01:28:18.687]  And I just want to ask you all to commit.
[01:28:19.767 --> 01:28:20.247]  Tell us about it.
[01:28:39.438 --> 01:28:41.639]  The slime wall it creates to steal your nutrients.
[01:28:41.639 --> 01:28:42.759]  It's very important.
[01:28:42.759 --> 01:28:44.060]  Most people have this problem.

[01:28:50.642 --> 01:28:51.542]  You have crushed them.
[01:28:51.542 --> 01:28:53.403]  Your will has crushed the enemy.
[01:28:55.225 --> 01:28:56.126]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:56.126 --> 01:28:58.527]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.

[01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:11.917]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:30:14.378 --> 01:30:21.523]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[01:31:08.072 --> 01:31:09.453]  So what do we do about it?

[01:31:59.215 --> 01:32:03.884]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:32:03.884 --> 01:32:05.387]  Op-op-op-optimum levels.
[01:32:06.465 --> 01:32:11.088]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:32:11.088 --> 01:32:13.430]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:15.231]  B vitamins we need every day.
[01:32:15.231 --> 01:32:20.495]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.

[01:32:29.901 --> 01:32:30.401]  We're good.
[01:32:59.346 --> 01:33:11.918]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.918 --> 01:33:13.460]  Yeah!
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:16.042]  The Republic is back!
[01:33:16.042 --> 01:33:18.665]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:18.665 --> 01:33:23.850]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:33:25.839 --> 01:33:29.420]  We are the resistance to the globalists and their worldwide corporate tyranny.
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:36.822]  And we are well on our way to restoring our republic with our prosperity, our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, and so much more.
[01:33:36.822 --> 01:33:41.083]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.083 --> 01:33:45.744]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com are the main sites.
[01:33:46.650 --> 01:33:54.917]  We're going to be talking to Jacques in Morocco, who's a great military source for us about big breaking news in a moment.
[01:33:54.917 --> 01:33:59.301]  And then I will go to your calls.
[01:33:59.301 --> 01:34:05.607]  And then we'll break down the big article in the Army Times with the top Marine General saying war is basically imminent.
[01:34:05.607 --> 01:34:07.749]  Top Marine General, there's a war coming.
[01:34:09.099 --> 01:34:12.460]  So, that's also in the Hill, it's also in the Army Times, you name it.
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:14.660]  It is big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:15.981]  That is where all this is going.
[01:34:15.981 --> 01:34:22.622]  So as great as I think Trump is, and as much as I like what's happening, I do not like the direction we're going on this front.
[01:34:22.622 --> 01:34:27.764]  So we'll be talking about that with Zach and others coming up.
[01:34:27.764 --> 01:34:36.486]  First off, ladies and gentlemen, every time I cover these issues, the media comes out and misrepresents what I've said.
[01:34:37.378 --> 01:34:44.344]  I don't want heterosexual, I don't want homosexual, I don't want anything sexual being taught to children.
[01:34:44.344 --> 01:34:49.448]  If they want to have health class, you know, in the 7th, 8th grade, teach them about the mechanics of the body, fine.
[01:34:49.448 --> 01:34:54.952]  But parents that didn't want that decades ago knew where the sexualization of children angle was leading.
[01:34:54.952 --> 01:35:04.440]  Give them a textbook, whatever, but don't sit there and have the system getting involved in the reproductive system of our children.
[01:35:05.305 --> 01:35:08.927]  The state's always been obsessed with this as a tool of social control.
[01:35:08.927 --> 01:35:17.773]  And last week I covered Discovery Channel, History Channel, and other shows about this new big trend of hundreds of new acronyms.
[01:35:18.869 --> 01:35:19.189]  I don't
[01:35:39.943 --> 01:35:40.884]  To break up the family.
[01:35:40.884 --> 01:35:42.227]  The globalists admit that.
[01:35:42.227 --> 01:35:43.028]  I mean, it's a fact.
[01:35:43.028 --> 01:35:46.313]  It doesn't, you know, even judging people as long as they're consenting adults.
[01:35:46.313 --> 01:35:48.216]  This is an admitted program.
[01:35:48.216 --> 01:35:53.003]  And the estrogen mimickers and all of it and the social engineers don't want to have a real debate about this.
[01:35:53.003 --> 01:35:53.183]  So...
[01:35:55.575 --> 01:36:02.437]  We then see things put out by Disney like Feminist Baby that says you can be a boy or a girl.
[01:36:02.437 --> 01:36:06.378]  And then it's got a weird image of the baby naked when you first open it up.
[01:36:06.378 --> 01:36:08.979]  I mean, it's all this sexualization of children.
[01:36:08.979 --> 01:36:10.819]  That's sold in Target.
[01:36:10.819 --> 01:36:20.302]  And then Kavil Paglia, who's a classical liberal and a lesbian, came out and points out that transgender propagandists are committing child abuse.
[01:36:21.377 --> 01:36:25.978]  I mean, they're going into five-year-olds and telling them, you're not really a boy, you're not really a girl.
[01:36:25.978 --> 01:36:32.899]  And kids think it's like playtime, like playing they're a fireman or playing they're a police person or whatever.
[01:36:32.899 --> 01:36:37.760]  And then they go, here, now, here's your fake genitals.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.341]  Wear this, you're now a boy.
[01:36:39.341 --> 01:36:40.121]  Or you're now a girl.
[01:36:40.121 --> 01:36:44.422]  Let's dress a boy as a girl and teach him how to tuck it between his legs.
[01:36:44.422 --> 01:36:46.622]  And let's teach a girl she's a boy.
[01:36:46.622 --> 01:36:48.883]  So the article is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:36:52.811 --> 01:36:59.352]  Little Transgender Shop sells fake genitals for little girls.
[01:36:59.352 --> 01:37:00.154]  Stand to pee.
[01:37:03.086 --> 01:37:09.870]  Genitals, the P word, designed for ages 8 to 13, Storr proudly declares.
[01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:17.334]  I won't even say the name because YouTube will use it to age restrict it so I can't warn people if I say what they're going to teach 3 year olds.
[01:37:17.334 --> 01:37:18.174]  You understand?
[01:37:18.174 --> 01:37:27.960]  I can't say to you on talk radio or on YouTube what they're doing to children because it might hurt children but they're doing it to children.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.183]  The mother of a young transgender is selling fake genitals for little girls.
[01:37:35.183 --> 01:37:36.384]  Fake Johnsons.
[01:37:36.384 --> 01:37:55.396]  Her website, transkids.biz, offers products ranging from tiny silicone male genitals, in circumcised and uncircumcised models, genitals pack holders, so little cars, little dolls, you have a little pack holder, and transgender books for kids.
[01:37:55.396 --> 01:37:56.497]  A girl like any other.
[01:37:57.864 --> 01:38:00.425]  Backwards Day, teaching you to be a girl.
[01:38:00.425 --> 01:38:05.306]  Princess of Great Darling.
[01:38:05.306 --> 01:38:13.209]  Trans Kids is run by Sarah, who also runs a site for trans guys called FT... I can't even pronounce this.
[01:38:13.209 --> 01:38:25.253]  Says the About Us page, featuring a pink-haired proprietor, after years of helping adults find high-quality gender expression gear, she saw the need for a site and a store that focused more on kids
[01:38:26.311 --> 01:38:27.471]  And they're unique needs.
[01:38:27.471 --> 01:38:33.114]  Yeah, it's like, I owned a liquor store and sold to adults at 21, but now I'm going to sell liquor directly to kids.
[01:38:33.114 --> 01:38:37.075]  If you want to sell this to adults, lady, knock yourself out!
[01:38:37.075 --> 01:38:38.596]  Stay away from kids!
[01:38:38.596 --> 01:38:41.157]  Stay away!
[01:38:41.157 --> 01:38:45.539]  Sarah is also the parent, this is what Jamil Paglia talks about, can you imagine?
[01:38:45.539 --> 01:38:50.561]  Is also the parent of a young transgender girl, so she has a son that she's taught to be a boy.
[01:38:51.496 --> 01:38:52.997]  Or she's got a son, she's thought to be a girl.
[01:38:52.997 --> 01:38:54.679]  How much do you believe this?
[01:38:54.679 --> 01:39:00.403]  Sarah is also the parent of a young transgender girl, so she hopes... You're not supposed to use the word girl.
[01:39:00.403 --> 01:39:02.365]  Oh, but see, they define what words you can use.
[01:39:02.365 --> 01:39:03.065]  They can use it.
[01:39:03.065 --> 01:39:15.795]  Sarah is also the parent of a young transgender girl, so she hopes that all parents coming here can trust this is a safe and affirming place where helping your kids live fully is our main goal.
[01:39:15.795 --> 01:39:17.416]  The fake genitals
[01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:22.348]  Are designed for ages 8 to 13 according to their product page.
[01:39:22.348 --> 01:39:26.411]  This is the smallest stand-to-pee device that we have seen.
[01:39:26.411 --> 01:39:30.554]  It states, designed especially for younger folks, 8 to 13 years old.
[01:39:30.554 --> 01:39:35.677]  These are discreet enough that they can be worn all day under the clothes.
[01:39:35.677 --> 01:39:42.102]  If your child was assigned female at birth, but wants to stand up while urinating, this just might work great for them.
[01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:44.470]  And then we've got the images of it.
[01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:48.772]  I mean, this is the bizarre perversion, the weirdness, the mass mental illness.
[01:39:48.772 --> 01:39:58.738]  Just like all over the UK and the US, they're now paying to have their eyes removed or Drano poured in their eyes, and the taxpayers will pay for you to be blind because you identify as a blind person.
[01:39:58.738 --> 01:40:01.640]  That's mental illness!
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:03.181]  People are now identifying as dogs!
[01:40:04.414 --> 01:40:13.167]  The store underscores how young children are increasingly being pressured to reconsider their gender identity, which critics have blasted as a form of child abuse.
[01:40:14.571 --> 01:40:16.652]  And then that's Camille Paglia talking about it.
[01:40:16.652 --> 01:40:18.374]  But there's another factor at play.
[01:40:18.374 --> 01:40:34.045]  Estrogen mimickers in household goods and grocery stores, and groceries, especially between all A, in plastics and atrazine, as well as foods, highly processed with soy ingredients, both of which are said to contribute to the low testosterone soy boy pandemic.
[01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:42.765]  Bisphenol A, BPA in particular, is known as a gender-bending chemical because of its link to male impotence and low sperm counts.
[01:40:42.765 --> 01:40:52.648]  Yeah, me and my son were driving to work this morning, because he's off because of Christmas, and I saw one of those little mini cars, the British one, I forget the name.
[01:40:54.850 --> 01:40:57.032]  It had a pink license plate and said, resist.
[01:40:57.032 --> 01:40:58.693]  And I said, wait, it's going to be a soy boy.
[01:40:58.693 --> 01:41:02.636]  We drove by, the guy looked like a concentration camp victim.
[01:41:02.636 --> 01:41:06.439]  And every time you see it, I mean, they are just totally leaderless.
[01:41:06.439 --> 01:41:07.159]  They have no idea.
[01:41:07.159 --> 01:41:08.320]  They're totally confused.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:16.146]  They just glom onto media, glom onto the bots that tell them, have a pink license plate, you know, drive the little mini car.
[01:41:16.146 --> 01:41:20.129]  And again, if one person was doing it or 10 people or a thousand, it's a cult.
[01:41:21.405 --> 01:41:27.957]  Estrogen mimickers increase estrogen activity in young men, leading to social anxiety and bitch tits, that's what they're medically called.
[01:41:27.957 --> 01:41:34.648]  So it's really not surprising that there's a generation of celibate hipsters running around in skinny jeans who are scared to death of the first...
[01:41:36.127 --> 01:41:37.769]  Of fistfights and women.
[01:41:37.769 --> 01:41:38.489]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:41:38.489 --> 01:41:39.090]  And it's been done.
[01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:50.360]  So here's the website, Trans Kids, and this is what's being pushed in the schools, it's what's being pushed with the sexualization, with drag queens at the schools and kids pole dancing and giving drag queens money.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:57.947]  I mean, you wouldn't have a heterosexual, a woman in there pole dancing and three-year-olds and five-year-olds handing them cash.
[01:41:57.947 --> 01:41:59.588]  That's for topless bars.
[01:41:59.588 --> 01:42:01.630]  Stop sexualizing children.
[01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:02.451]  Stop doing it.
[01:42:04.096 --> 01:42:08.700]  It's child abuse, just like Camille Paglia said, and it's all about the sexualization of children.
[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:21.912]  It's an agenda of Hollywood and the globalists, and it's meant to break up our families and make us leaderless, and absolutely in the male and the female, biologically, under the THX 1138 Brave New World program of UNESCO and the UN, which is documented and admitted.
[01:42:21.912 --> 01:42:23.753]  Look up Atrazine, look it all up for yourself.
[01:42:23.753 --> 01:42:30.699]  We're gonna go to break and come back with Zach in Morocco with his latest information, and then all of your phone calls through this hour right into the next.
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:38.828]  Speak out, say no to this, be aware of it, and understand the parents doing this to young children, in my view, are abusing them.
[01:42:38.828 --> 01:42:42.331]  This is abusive, it's bizarre, it's sick.
[01:42:42.331 --> 01:42:43.352]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:43.352 --> 01:42:45.454]  Stop experimenting on your children.
[01:42:45.454 --> 01:42:47.917]  But after all, we're all in a big experiment right now.
[01:42:47.917 --> 01:42:48.738]  Under globalists.
[01:42:48.738 --> 01:42:51.881]  We're under chemical, biological, cultural, and spiritual attack.
[01:42:51.881 --> 01:42:53.363]  Wake up, resist, and we will win.
[01:42:55.627 --> 01:43:00.770]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:05.552]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:43:05.552 --> 01:43:13.836]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:43:14.236 --> 01:43:17.721]  This is critical, because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[01:43:17.721 --> 01:43:22.988]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:43:22.988 --> 01:43:29.897]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:43:30.578 --> 01:43:34.180]  You know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:38.903]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:43:38.903 --> 01:43:47.007]  Floralife is sold as a $15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a $50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:43:47.007 --> 01:43:51.209]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[01:43:51.209 --> 01:43:52.510]  That's Infowarslife.com.

[01:44:01.492 --> 01:44:05.856]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.

[01:44:13.124 --> 01:44:21.769]  Our super high quality nascent iodine is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[01:44:21.769 --> 01:44:29.534]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[01:44:29.534 --> 01:44:36.438]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[01:44:36.818 --> 01:44:43.042]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.
[01:44:43.042 --> 01:44:46.864]  Take control of your chemistry today with this super combo.

[01:44:55.909 --> 01:44:58.150]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[01:44:59.057 --> 01:45:01.000]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:10.375]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:45:11.176 --> 01:45:17.941]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:45:17.941 --> 01:45:20.202]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:45:20.202 --> 01:45:21.263]  Thank you.
[01:45:21.263 --> 01:45:23.745]  I use the BioTruth Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:45:23.745 --> 01:45:28.068]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:45:28.068 --> 01:45:31.090]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:45:31.090 --> 01:45:32.410]  They are quality.
[01:45:32.410 --> 01:45:34.152]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:45:34.152 --> 01:45:37.034]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:45:37.034 --> 01:45:37.574]  Absolutely.
[01:45:38.094 --> 01:45:51.005]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:45:55.649 --> 01:46:07.753]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:46:07.753 --> 01:46:09.114]  So what do we do about it?
[01:46:09.114 --> 01:46:12.455]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:46:12.455 --> 01:46:18.557]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged Brain Force Plus and feel the rush
[01:46:18.937 --> 01:46:20.197]  Without the crash.
[01:46:20.197 --> 01:46:26.459]  RainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[01:46:26.459 --> 01:46:32.381]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extract.
[01:46:32.381 --> 01:46:34.342]  It gives you an added kick.

[01:46:47.934 --> 01:46:49.255]  It's the real deal.
[01:46:49.255 --> 01:46:50.996]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:46:50.996 --> 01:46:58.823]  Secure your bottle right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:58.823 --> 01:47:01.506]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:25.076]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.076 --> 01:47:28.158]  You mark my words!
[01:47:28.158 --> 01:47:37.884]  YouTube, Facebook and others are either going to take the video down when I upload this, or say it's age-restricted, because that's how they keep the public from learning what's going on with the children.
[01:47:37.884 --> 01:47:39.645]  It's all an agenda.
[01:47:39.645 --> 01:47:44.528]  They can go into three and four and five year olds in public schools and tell them, you're a little girl if you're a boy.
[01:47:44.528 --> 01:47:44.869]  You're a...
[01:47:45.748 --> 01:47:47.189]  You're a boy if you're a little girl.
[01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:49.011]  You're a girl if you're a little boy.
[01:47:49.011 --> 01:47:54.174]  And vice versa, as Camille Paglia says, serious child abuse.
[01:47:54.174 --> 01:48:01.580]  But then, if we even try to show you what they publicly put on the website, we'll have our website shut down.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:11.668]  So we have it blurred out here, but notice the little transgender books they're giving the kids, and the fake prosthetic genitals for little girls, they show it in the hand.
[01:48:13.123 --> 01:48:20.387]  Now, again, the hand on the image of the prosthesis of the artificial genital.
[01:48:20.387 --> 01:48:23.269]  And again, that's what's on their actual site, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:23.269 --> 01:48:26.951]  And people will say, hey, it's okay to have adults tell little kids about this.
[01:48:26.951 --> 01:48:30.452]  Just don't show adults on YouTube or other children.
[01:48:30.452 --> 01:48:32.013]  Good Lord!
[01:48:32.013 --> 01:48:32.874]  Get it off the screen.
[01:48:32.874 --> 01:48:35.035]  I can't look at it anymore.
[01:48:35.035 --> 01:48:36.776]  And this is how little girls can urinate.
[01:48:37.810 --> 01:48:42.192]  And the parents can go in and say it's your choice at age 4 whether you want to be a boy or a girl.
[01:48:42.192 --> 01:48:50.056]  You can't go into a child and say it's your choice if you want to take PCP, or drink a bottle of Jack Daniels, or if you want to take inoculations, or if you want to date the next door neighbor.
[01:48:50.056 --> 01:48:52.237]  You're not at the age of consent!
[01:48:52.237 --> 01:48:53.938]  This is abuse!
[01:48:53.938 --> 01:48:55.059]  Cut and dry!
[01:48:55.059 --> 01:48:58.741]  And Google, and Facebook, and Twitter are all there pushing it!
[01:48:59.656 --> 01:49:02.877]  And it's not hate of someone that thinks they're another sex.
[01:49:02.877 --> 01:49:08.859]  It's the hate of pushing garbage, whether it's heterosexual, homosexual, whatever it is, on children.
[01:49:08.859 --> 01:49:11.760]  Leave the children alone!
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:12.641]  Hey!
[01:49:12.641 --> 01:49:13.561]  Teacher!
[01:49:13.561 --> 01:49:14.822]  Leave them kids alone!
[01:49:14.822 --> 01:49:16.282]  Hey!
[01:49:16.282 --> 01:49:17.202]  Nambla!
[01:49:17.202 --> 01:49:18.403]  Leave them kids alone!
[01:49:19.718 --> 01:49:22.039]  Because all in all, it's going to be another brick in the wall.
[01:49:22.039 --> 01:49:31.941]  And the rebellion against what you've done is going to be massive in Generation X, Generation Y, Generation Z, all the rest of it as humanity awakens.
[01:49:31.941 --> 01:49:32.581]  I'm done ranting.
[01:49:32.581 --> 01:49:34.342]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:49:34.342 --> 01:49:36.282]  I saw this this morning as they were writing the article about it.
[01:49:36.282 --> 01:49:37.802]  It upset me the last hour.
[01:49:37.802 --> 01:49:38.643]  I just bit my tongue.
[01:49:38.643 --> 01:49:39.803]  I'm so mad.
[01:49:39.803 --> 01:49:41.743]  Leave the kids alone, for heaven's sakes!
[01:49:41.743 --> 01:49:43.004]  You freaks!
[01:49:43.004 --> 01:49:43.704]  God Almighty!
[01:49:44.909 --> 01:49:49.392]  Heterosexual, homosexual, it's all called pedophilia when you target kids.
[01:49:49.392 --> 01:49:50.813]  So knock it off!
[01:49:50.813 --> 01:49:56.677]  The whole branding of this, and a lot of liberals, they want a social virtue signal with every new thing.
[01:49:56.677 --> 01:50:14.689]  So they're not into this stuff, they just, okay, Muslims aren't terrorists, and cutting women's genitals off is liberal, and throwing gays off buildings is, you know, and Islam is good, and, you know, and sexualizing small children is good, and, you know, because I'm in a virtue signal, I'm in a virtue signal, I'm in a virtue signal, just like me, just like me, just like me, and you're these alone nobodies.
[01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:18.091]  The leftists always walk up and go, boo, boo, boo!
[01:50:18.091 --> 01:50:19.712]  Knock my drink over or whatever.
[01:50:19.712 --> 01:50:20.652]  Everybody hates you!
[01:50:20.652 --> 01:50:21.633]  Don't you feel ashamed?
[01:50:21.633 --> 01:50:23.354]  And I just bask like it's the sun.
[01:50:23.354 --> 01:50:27.196]  I go, quite proud to take America back and the world's next.
[01:50:27.196 --> 01:50:31.719]  And we're turning things around and praising the family and free market and Jesus Christ.
[01:50:31.719 --> 01:50:33.440]  How do you like that?
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:37.322]  And they just go, yeah, I'm not like you.
[01:50:37.322 --> 01:50:39.143]  I'm not like you people.
[01:50:39.143 --> 01:50:42.245]  I'm not an empty person that's off what other people think about me.
[01:50:42.245 --> 01:50:43.966]  I've got something in me.
[01:50:45.111 --> 01:50:45.551]  You understand?
[01:50:45.551 --> 01:50:46.132]  In me.
[01:50:46.132 --> 01:50:48.254]  Right here, right here, and right here.
[01:50:48.254 --> 01:50:48.694]  Right here.
[01:50:48.694 --> 01:50:49.134]  Three spots.
[01:50:49.134 --> 01:50:49.675]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:50:49.675 --> 01:50:50.235]  Right here.
[01:50:50.235 --> 01:50:51.676]  Wow, that's what I go off of.
[01:50:51.676 --> 01:50:53.238]  Feels good there.
[01:50:53.238 --> 01:50:54.118]  It's called a conscience.
[01:50:54.118 --> 01:50:55.640]  It's called my wiring.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.861]  I follow that.
[01:50:56.861 --> 01:50:57.701]  My wiring.
[01:50:57.701 --> 01:50:59.363]  You haven't got to my wiring yet.
[01:50:59.363 --> 01:51:01.865]  You're trying to get to everybody else's wiring, but you're gonna fail.
[01:51:01.865 --> 01:51:03.546]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and go to these calls.
[01:51:03.546 --> 01:51:04.807]  So we got them loaded up.
[01:51:04.807 --> 01:51:08.811]  Phil, Kevin, John, Rich, Deborah, Eugene, Jeff, Louis,
[01:51:09.491 --> 01:51:10.992]  Corey, we're going to go to all of you.
[01:51:10.992 --> 01:51:11.712]  Thank you for holding.
[01:51:11.712 --> 01:51:12.333]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:51:12.333 --> 01:51:13.534]  We're going to get to you.
[01:51:13.534 --> 01:51:16.615]  On the future of Trump, all the big promises coming through.
[01:51:16.615 --> 01:51:17.996]  How will the globalists strike back?
[01:51:17.996 --> 01:51:20.098]  New York Times saying that, you know, the coup's going on.
[01:51:20.098 --> 01:51:21.178]  We're going to talk about it all.
[01:51:21.178 --> 01:51:27.282]  But Zach in Morocco hasn't given a secret info, but he's been in Army Special Operations and Intelligence.
[01:51:27.282 --> 01:51:28.483]  He's actually known.
[01:51:28.483 --> 01:51:29.343]  He's been in the news.
[01:51:29.343 --> 01:51:30.464]  We know who he is.
[01:51:30.464 --> 01:51:33.106]  He's not ready to go public yet, but he gets through on the line.
[01:51:33.106 --> 01:51:36.848]  We should just call Zach routinely once a week, get updates, not just make him fight to get on the line.
[01:51:36.848 --> 01:51:37.468]  That's my fault.
[01:51:37.468 --> 01:51:38.149]  Should have thought of that.
[01:51:38.949 --> 01:51:43.313]  But, Zach, over there in Morocco, what do you make of the latest info?
[01:51:43.313 --> 01:51:45.735]  And Top Marine General says there's a war coming.
[01:51:45.735 --> 01:51:48.817]  That's in the Hill newspaper.
[01:51:48.817 --> 01:51:53.261]  Yes, Alex, it's great to be back on, and I just had to connect some dots here.
[01:51:53.261 --> 01:52:05.291]  Everything you've laid out is pretty accurate so far, but I just wanted to connect some dots about the deep state death hurdle that will commence on the eve of Christmas into the new year, because they are going to go for broke.
[01:52:05.291 --> 01:52:08.133]  With that being said, we need to start out with some key information.
[01:52:08.812 --> 01:52:22.102]  Last time when myself and you were on, we brought up the HRC, Huma Abedin, Barak Hussain connection, that set off some alarm bells, and everybody knows what's gone on there with the researchers.
[01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:37.414]  Now, I'm going to drop some information that will make the snow and stuff look like snowflakes compared to the avalanche that I'm about to unleash, because the stuff I'm privy to is very important, and at this point, this is a duty to kind of relay it, so I'm going to go ahead and do that here.
[01:52:38.719 --> 01:52:48.807]  Um, you know, when it comes to this fast and furious thing, when it comes to this radical Islamic thing, let's look at one individual in particular, which will bring it all down.
[01:52:48.807 --> 01:52:52.449]  That individual's name is Anwar al-Awlaki.
[01:52:52.449 --> 01:53:07.801]  Anwar al-Awlaki, the American, the New Mexico born, Colorado State educated, George Washington University educated, Anwar al-Awlaki, the influencer of Major Nidal Hassan at Fort Hood.
[01:53:08.482 --> 01:53:12.645]  That Anwar al-Awlaki is a major point in this.
[01:53:12.645 --> 01:53:15.346]  This Islamic threat is fabricated.
[01:53:15.346 --> 01:53:24.552]  You know, you have the FBI and you have the NSA days after the attack at Fort Hood coming out and saying, wow, he was talking with Anwar al-Awlaki.
[01:53:24.552 --> 01:53:26.173]  But let me get this straight.
[01:53:26.173 --> 01:53:30.036]  You have this information two to three days after this Fort Hood massacre there.
[01:53:31.052 --> 01:53:33.233]  How would you have that information two to three days later?
[01:53:33.233 --> 01:53:36.895]  Well, later came out that the CIA knew he was talking to him for two years.
[01:53:36.895 --> 01:53:45.279]  Oh, well, not only talking to him, they've presented Anwar al-Awlaki as a Yemeni cleric who is inciting violence with the United States.
[01:53:45.279 --> 01:53:48.061]  No, Anwar al-Awlaki was born in New Mexico.
[01:53:48.061 --> 01:53:50.862]  Anwar al-Awlaki was an intellectual.
[01:53:50.862 --> 01:53:58.446]  Anwar al-Awlaki was educated at the university in Colorado State in George Washington, George Washington University.
[01:53:58.446 --> 01:53:59.166]  This is critical.
[01:53:59.838 --> 01:54:07.444]  Okay, this is very critical, because this was all a setup, and they went too far here, and I witnessed it.
[01:54:07.444 --> 01:54:26.961]  So this is all going on while Fast and Furious is going on, where they're taking weapons from Fort Bliss in El Paso, moving them across the border, into the Kingdom of Morocco, through the Sahara, in Algeria, eventually making their way to Libya, where they will defeat Gaddafi's reign there, and create ISIS.
[01:54:26.961 --> 01:54:27.862]  So this is deep.
[01:54:29.092 --> 01:54:32.993]  That's what Tosh Plumlee, the CIA whistleblower, said here.
[01:54:32.993 --> 01:54:34.934]  Was his info he broke down accurate from what you know?
[01:54:34.934 --> 01:54:40.296]  Yeah, it was pretty accurate, but I was witness to it.
[01:54:40.296 --> 01:54:41.496]  I know exactly what happened there.
[01:54:41.496 --> 01:54:43.017]  And it's not a secret.
[01:54:43.017 --> 01:54:55.601]  People blew the whistle in Morocco and the DST commander in Morocco... So just to boil it down, why was Obama arming the Muslim Brotherhood and arming radical jihadists to destabilize moderate Muslim states?
[01:54:56.849 --> 01:54:57.329]  Right.
[01:54:57.329 --> 01:55:03.074]  So destabilizing modern states and also creating ISIS to wreak havoc as we see in the world today.
[01:55:03.074 --> 01:55:11.261]  So this is not a blind eye, this is black ops, this is the CIA, this was funded by the highest powers that be reigning in our country at the time.
[01:55:11.261 --> 01:55:13.103]  So this is why this is so critical.
[01:55:13.103 --> 01:55:19.749]  I mean, you know, we do have a radical Islamic threat, but we need to realize where the funding comes from and who's really involved.
[01:55:19.749 --> 01:55:21.750]  And it's the left and it's the deep state.
[01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:22.331]  Without question.
[01:55:23.729 --> 01:55:36.935]  Absolutely, that's what the evidence shows, and it appears Trump is trying to actually cut that off and end that, and make deals to actually try to stabilize the Middle East again, but that McMaster and others are double-crossing, still trying to go back to the old game right under Trump's nose.
[01:55:36.935 --> 01:55:43.998]  It's absolutely unbelievable, and since the Trump administration has, you know, been in office, since some of the power positions have changed,
[01:55:44.491 --> 01:55:47.873]  We've seen incredible changes reach around the world.
[01:55:47.873 --> 01:56:00.158]  I'm just saying, by first-hand information, when this information actually comes out, and I'm kind of hitting at some things without getting into anything very classified, but, you know, Fast and Furious was ran by our country.
[01:56:00.158 --> 01:56:02.239]  Fast and Furious is what created ISIS.
[01:56:02.239 --> 01:56:03.239]  There's just no way around it.
[01:56:03.239 --> 01:56:04.300]  This just wasn't Saws.
[01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:05.120]  This just wasn't M4s.
[01:56:07.153 --> 01:56:11.137]  This was shorter-filed weapons, this was artillery, this was everything.
[01:56:11.137 --> 01:56:12.538]  This was a standing up of violence.
[01:56:12.538 --> 01:56:17.623]  Sure, that was Obama and the EU and the globalists from all our research and our sources.
[01:56:17.623 --> 01:56:21.887]  Now you see the info coming out about arming Hezbollah as well.
[01:56:21.887 --> 01:56:25.550]  I mean, why is that suddenly coming out in all places politico?
[01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:30.375]  Well, that's coming out and also what's coming out is sort of this UFO leaking and some of this other technology leaking because
[01:56:31.041 --> 01:56:41.370]  What's essentially coming out is some of our deepest, I guess, quote-unquote secrets of what's going on, because what we're going to see, and you hinted to it earlier as we got on the phone, there will be a strike on North Korea.
[01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:45.194]  I've been calling you and talking to you about this for six months, the ending of strategic patience.
[01:56:45.194 --> 01:56:53.541]  There will be an attack there, and the real issue there is people think about the collateral damage and what will occur there, but it will be sophisticated.
[01:56:53.541 --> 01:56:55.223]  We will unleash weapons that we do
[01:56:56.235 --> 01:57:01.578]  Currently have, that have been field tested, but will actually be using conventional warfare for the first time.
[01:57:01.578 --> 01:57:06.060]  These will be EMP, these will be strategic nuclear weapons, this will be all of it.
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:09.982]  And I did start the call up, I think, on the eve of Christmas.
[01:57:09.982 --> 01:57:12.203]  I'm dubbing it the Deep State Death Hurdle.
[01:57:12.203 --> 01:57:13.264]  They're red-handed.
[01:57:13.264 --> 01:57:17.346]  The information that I just laid out is damning, and this is nothing special.
[01:57:17.346 --> 01:57:18.887]  It's going to come out.
[01:57:18.887 --> 01:57:20.428]  It's going to come out.
[01:57:20.428 --> 01:57:22.909]  Before they said the NSA wasn't spying, it comes out they're spying.
[01:57:23.746 --> 01:57:25.667]  Before they said, no, we didn't arm ISIS.
[01:57:25.667 --> 01:57:27.088]  No, you did arm ISIS.
[01:57:27.088 --> 01:57:28.969]  Now the House of Cards is following.
[01:57:28.969 --> 01:57:30.691]  They are desperate.
[01:57:30.691 --> 01:57:32.312]  And is it not Donald Trump for real?
[01:57:32.312 --> 01:57:33.993]  I mean, that's why they're so scared.
[01:57:33.993 --> 01:57:34.713]  Oh, it's for real.
[01:57:34.713 --> 01:57:35.934]  This is history in the making.
[01:57:35.934 --> 01:57:38.335]  This is as sensational as it can be.
[01:57:38.335 --> 01:57:39.156]  Stay right there.
[01:57:39.156 --> 01:57:41.618]  Let's come right back and finish up with Zach and all your other calls.
[01:57:41.618 --> 01:57:42.178]  Stay with us.
[01:57:42.178 --> 01:57:42.638]  Third Hour.
[01:57:42.638 --> 01:57:43.559]  Please spread the links, folks.
