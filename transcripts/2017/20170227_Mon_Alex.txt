[00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:11.043]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:20.067]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:22.327]  Here we are, kicking off another week.
[00:00:22.327 --> 00:00:24.468]  Monday, the 27th day of February 2017.
[00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:29.290]  I'm your host Alex Jones, here teleprompter free.
[00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.451]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:39.622]  You know, Starbucks came out a month ago and said they're going to hire 10,000 refugees.
[00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:44.346]  And in major consumer indexes, they have absolutely plunged.
[00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:47.209]  Their brand has gone into the toilet.
[00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:57.377]  And isn't that emblematic of how everything the globalists are pushing is tanking with public sentiment in the public mind?
[00:00:57.377 --> 00:01:01.020]  The public is rejecting them lock, stock and barrel.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.481]  Meanwhile,
[00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:12.471]  The enemies of this republic are in high gear trying to kill the Trump recovery that we're only 40-something days into with everything they've got.
[00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:20.836]  I've got a stack of news where the financial publications are running down this country and running down the UK for trying to pull out of the EU.
[00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:24.099]  There is an all-out financial war going on.
[00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:25.640]  Communist China has weighed in.
[00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:46.603]  Hollywood, of course, last night praised Tehran and the Mullahs praised Hollywood and said how great they were and that they admire the anti-American sentiment when no one in Hollywood who supports the whole anti-family agenda could even live in Iran.
[00:01:46.603 --> 00:01:51.186]  But they don't care because Iran has some anti-American sentiment.
[00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:55.990]  Most of the young people in major surveys in Iran actually hate the Mullahs, but nevertheless,
[00:01:57.227 --> 00:02:05.352]  Nevertheless, the Iranian dictator condemns Donald Trump's Muslim ban in powerful Oscars acceptance speech.
[00:02:05.352 --> 00:02:07.093]  Iranian director.
[00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.294]  I had a Freudian slip.
[00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.255]  Dictator.
[00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:11.836]  Iranian director.
[00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:18.560]  Ozgarhar Farhadi condemns Donald Trump's Muslim ban in powerful Oscar acceptance speech.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.282]  Funny.
[00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:25.485]  Iran has a ban on Christians and Jews coming into the country and trying to live there.
[00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.427]  But that's okay!
[00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:31.328]  Because this is all a one-sided street.
[00:02:31.328 --> 00:02:33.570]  We're not banning Muslims.
[00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:42.277]  We're banning people from seven failed states like Sudan and Somalia and Libya that don't even have working public airports.
[00:02:42.277 --> 00:02:45.899]  And where women are sold into slavery and their genitals cut off.
[00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:46.520]  But it doesn't matter!
[00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:57.721]  Because they could badmouth, I mean, it would take all day to air all the different so-called stars, most of them foreigners it seemed, up there running down this country and running down President Trump.
[00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:02.223]  And, oh, and Jimmy Kimmel saying the world hates America because of Trump.
[00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:10.527]  No, many areas of the world hate the United States because the globalists have used us to expand their system while they ran us down.
[00:03:10.527 --> 00:03:14.949]  Now the globalists are fully conquering the U.S., they're using some of the hatred they helped generate
[00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:22.472]  As a way to further bring down this country, the truth is the world respects Trump.
[00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:32.898]  From the folks in the UK, to France, to Russia, to Japan, to many areas of Africa and Latin America, they understand the exploitation America is going under because they've been under it.
[00:03:32.898 --> 00:03:37.440]  And peoples and nations are all together against the globalist threat.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.561]  We all share that common enemy.
[00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:50.808]  I was watching Fox News this morning while I was exercising and they were going to Ellis Island talking about all the things you had to do to get through to the United States.
[00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:57.714]  Yeah, not have TB, not have the plague, and not be a burden on the society.
[00:03:57.714 --> 00:04:03.999]  You couldn't be handicapped because they didn't have a big social welfare system.
[00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:05.220]  We couldn't have the world dump.
[00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:08.615]  People on us or it would make our country go down.
[00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.517]  We brought hard-working peasants into the country.
[00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:15.580]  That's who this nation wanted.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.042]  That's what America is based on.
[00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:25.246]  So they can become wealthy and successful and actually get out of their caste systems that they were in every other country.
[00:04:25.246 --> 00:04:28.068]  From Japan to Italy.
[00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:28.488]  But now...
[00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:46.425]  The great grandkids of those kids, of those people that came here, are brainwashed, running around bitching and complaining, you know, saying, give me free government this, give me free government that, and open the borders up, on and on and on, having no connection to reality, but living in La La Land.
[00:04:46.425 --> 00:04:56.730]  Speaking of La La Land, they announced that La La Land had won, and of course it was really moonlight, just showing how they can't get their act together, a bunch of dysfunctional scum.
[00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.612]  The United States foreign policy and engagement with Syria has been a disaster, and it may start and end with John McCain.
[00:05:05.612 --> 00:05:09.594]  Four years, McCain has been a buffer between the Middle East and the United States.
[00:05:09.594 --> 00:05:11.634]  McCain took a rare trip to Syria in 2013.
[00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:15.336]  He met with so-called moderate rebels Obama was bankrolling and arming.
[00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:18.477]  It turned out that these moderate rebels were the ones destabilizing the region.
[00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.359]  And could even be tied to ISIS.
[00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:27.165]  But of course, this would fit the foreign policy of the Obama administration and the Clinton State Department, which wanted Bashar Assad removed from power.
[00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:30.408]  Last week, McCain took another rare and secret trip to Syria.
[00:05:30.408 --> 00:05:33.311]  A spokesperson for McCain said he was there to visit with U.S.
[00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:36.073]  ground forces to discuss plans to defeat ISIL.
[00:05:36.073 --> 00:05:38.436]  ISIL, not ISIS, they were sure to clarify.
[00:05:38.436 --> 00:05:39.717]  Now, how coincidental,
[00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:44.541]  Upon McCain's return to the U.S., news stories everywhere are talking about more U.S.
[00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:46.302]  ground forces being sent to Syria.
[00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:50.266]  John McCain is a detriment to our nation, the Middle East, and peace on this planet.
[00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:56.651]  He needs to be removed from any unelected duties, and it is upon the people in the great state of Arizona to rid us of this warmonger.
[00:05:56.651 --> 00:05:58.673]  For InfoWars.com, I'm Owen Schroer.
[00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.531]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:01.531 --> 00:06:08.134]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:11.296]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:21.080]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.921]  Caveman.
[00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:26.983]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:29.104]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:29.404 --> 00:06:32.545]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:37.687]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:37.687 --> 00:06:45.829]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:53.771]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:58.433]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLive.com today.
[00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:09.780]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.705]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:22.930]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.891]  In our quest for the purest iodine,
[00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:31.873]  We drilled down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[00:07:31.873 --> 00:07:35.774]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[00:07:35.774 --> 00:07:38.615]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:42.656]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield, nascent iodine,
[00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:43.597]  We're good to go.
[00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:07.015]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:44.914]  This broadcast is being watched live by millions of Americans and around the world in more than 225 countries that now hate us.
[00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:47.695]  And I think that is an amazing thing.
[00:08:48.982 --> 00:08:52.324]  I'm not the man to unite this country, but it can be done.
[00:08:52.324 --> 00:09:12.859]  You know, if every person watching this show, I don't want to get too serious, but there are millions and millions of people watching right now, and if every one of you took a minute to reach out to one person you disagree with, someone you like, and have a positive, considerate conversation, not as liberals or conservatives, as Americans, if we would all do that, we could make America great again.
[00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:14.640]  We really could.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.922]  It starts with us.
[00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:28.522]  As you know, she was nominated for her performance in the movie Elle, and on behalf of everyone here, I would like to say, we didn't see Elle, but we absolutely loved it.
[00:09:28.522 --> 00:09:33.706]  You were amazing in that film, and I'm glad Homeland Security let you in tonight.
[00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.047]  I really am.
[00:09:35.047 --> 00:09:42.574]  Meryl Streep has phoned it in for more than 50 films over the course of her lackluster career.
[00:09:42.574 --> 00:09:45.036]  This is Meryl's 20th Oscar nomination.
[00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:53.830]  Even more, made even more amazing considering the fact that she wasn't even in a movie this year.
[00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.391]  We just wrote her name down out of habit.
[00:09:56.391 --> 00:09:57.451]  Meryl, stand up if you would.
[00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:13.175]  Everybody, please join me in giving Meryl Streep a totally undeserved round of applause, will you?
[00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:15.556]  The highly overrated Meryl Streep, everyone.
[00:10:18.203 --> 00:10:19.104]  We're gonna have fun tonight.
[00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:22.287]  I hope we're gonna have fun tonight.
[00:10:22.287 --> 00:10:23.148]  Nice dress, by the way.
[00:10:23.148 --> 00:10:23.929]  Is that an Ivanka?
[00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:27.894]  This is exciting.
[00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:34.558]  I think it's important that we all, I know we've all seen it all, but it's important that we take a second to appreciate what is happening here.
[00:10:34.558 --> 00:10:37.400]  We're at the Oscars, the Academy Awards.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.001]  You're nominated.
[00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:40.142]  You got to come.
[00:10:40.142 --> 00:10:41.963]  Your families are nominated, your friends.
[00:10:41.963 --> 00:10:51.489]  Some of you will get to come up here on this stage tonight and give a speech that the President of the United States will tweet about in all caps during his 5 a.m.
[00:10:51.489 --> 00:10:52.590]  bowel movement tomorrow.
[00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:56.971]  See, it's so easy to reach out and heal.
[00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:03.614]  And I want to say, maybe this is not a popular thing to say, but I want to say thank you to President Trump.
[00:11:03.614 --> 00:11:09.258]  I mean, remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?
[00:11:09.258 --> 00:11:13.500]  That's where you fought progress.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.261]  We lost, by the way.
[00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:17.302]  I'm sorry, no.
[00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.883]  There's a mistake.
[00:11:18.883 --> 00:11:20.424]  Moonlight, you guys won Best Picture.
[00:11:20.424 --> 00:11:21.545]  Smooth move, dumbass.
[00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:27.302]  There you go.
[00:11:27.302 --> 00:11:41.212]  They were too busy running around lying about Donald Trump and the nationalist movement that's desperately trying to devolve power from the corrupt Hollywood on the West Coast and the corrupt mega banks that have hijacked the country on the East Coast.
[00:11:41.212 --> 00:11:55.223]  They were too busy demonizing a true American champion with incredible charisma and courage to try to restore this republic and be a beacon to other nations to pull out of the corporate global system.
[00:11:56.909 --> 00:12:18.538]  And all these cowards get up there with their neurotic lifestyles, and all their corruption, and all their butlers, and all their face creams, and facelifts, and all the rest of it, and their train wreck lifestyle, and lecture us that we should all bow down to them because Hollywood celebrities know everything.
[00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:20.539]  And it doesn't mean I don't like a Kurt Russell.
[00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:28.412]  It doesn't mean I don't like, you know, some of the great actors out there like Clint Eastwood.
[00:12:28.412 --> 00:12:31.213]  And they all seem to be patriots, don't they?
[00:12:31.213 --> 00:12:36.154]  You like them in their roles your whole life, and then it turns out they're listeners.
[00:12:36.154 --> 00:12:43.937]  Turns out they're dialed into the truth before you were even born.
[00:12:43.937 --> 00:12:51.799]  But all the rest of them are just the most conceited, twisted, deceptive, hypocritical people on the planet.
[00:12:53.001 --> 00:13:13.978]  Meryl Streep has famously come out, remember, back in 2003, and lobbied and campaigned for Roman Polanski to have his child rape pedophilia conviction overturned after he grabbed a 13-year-old girl, drugged her, and raped her anally.
[00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:24.570]  And she got up and gave a standing ovation when he was nominated for a film in 2003 and helped run the movement.
[00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.910]  Promoting the movement.
[00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.591]  That's how arrogant she is.
[00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:35.652]  Promoting the move to get him clemency.
[00:13:35.652 --> 00:13:37.692]  That's disconnected, folks.
[00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.073]  And that's who we're talking about here.
[00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:43.654]  They think you're there like dirt under their shoes.
[00:13:43.654 --> 00:13:44.834]  It's like Elon Musk and
[00:13:47.352 --> 00:13:51.514]  Ray Kurzweil, all of them say, you will merge with machines or be obsolete.
[00:13:51.514 --> 00:13:55.716]  You will merge with machines or be stepped on like a bug.
[00:13:55.716 --> 00:13:57.417]  They believe they know the future.
[00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.458]  They believe they know how we're going to live.
[00:13:59.458 --> 00:14:01.839]  They believe they have full control over us.
[00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:12.425]  But the truth is, whether it's Hollywood, or whether it's Starbucks, or whether it's other globalist publications or operations, they're all globally, not just domestically, going into the toilet.
[00:14:15.017 --> 00:14:26.263]  In fact, it's admitted now in the trade publications today, Variety and others, that Hollywood hopes Trump lets China buy them up because they're completely bankrupt.
[00:14:26.263 --> 00:14:27.964]  It's already over.
[00:14:27.964 --> 00:14:30.025]  They're bankrupt.
[00:14:30.025 --> 00:14:38.609]  And even when Matt Damon makes movies for the China market, like The Great Wall, it loses $80 million.
[00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:39.030]  J.K.
[00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.312]  Rowling has giant palaces all over the world, from Tasmania to London.
[00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:56.619]  But she wants you to take violent, military-age men, Somali and Sudanese refugees in your poor neighborhood, but she won't take them in hers.
[00:14:56.619 --> 00:15:00.280]  Again, disgusting, pig-like hypocrites.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.761]  Jokes!
[00:15:02.761 --> 00:15:05.643]  Totally anathema!
[00:15:05.643 --> 00:15:08.164]  I watched large sections of the Oscars this morning.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:18.944]  And I noticed that they tried to get kids up on the stage and bring, you know, locals in and try to make it about the viewers, because they know their ratings are in the tank.
[00:15:18.944 --> 00:15:24.626]  They know people are sick of celebrities, sick of empty garbage.
[00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:30.388]  You go out and you do advertising with a celebrity, it doesn't sell nowadays.
[00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:33.190]  It's in the trade publications, but we've tested it ourselves.
[00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:38.832]  You go out and you advertise with a regular, real person that's genuine, you have incredible success.
[00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:44.734]  The people are running from the establishment, running from liberalism.
[00:15:44.734 --> 00:15:50.258]  It is the most old hat, orthodox, oppressive religion in the world.
[00:15:50.258 --> 00:16:02.889]  It's a religion of being guilty, a religion of being obsessed with how you talk and what you do, a religion of groveling to a cult that tells you how to live and how to dress and where to go and how to speak.
[00:16:02.889 --> 00:16:04.490]  No!
[00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.451]  We reject you.
[00:16:07.205 --> 00:16:08.586]  And Donald Trump knows that.
[00:16:08.586 --> 00:16:13.832]  How beautiful that he canceled the Correspondents' Dinner.
[00:16:13.832 --> 00:16:15.113]  Oh yes, it's canceled.
[00:16:15.113 --> 00:16:16.374]  It's about the White House.
[00:16:16.374 --> 00:16:17.876]  It's about the President.
[00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:21.419]  I love the media keeps acting like, oh, he's not going.
[00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:22.521]  Will that hurt it?
[00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:25.704]  It's all about the White House Correspondents' Dinner.
[00:16:27.256 --> 00:16:36.667]  And turn into this whole thing about the media that's openly calling almost every publication that'll be there, calls for his death, his overthrow, calls him a racist, lies about him.
[00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:41.993]  Why should he go to an event when he breathes life into it?
[00:16:41.993 --> 00:16:47.579]  Why should he go to a vampire's feast when he's the only red-blooded human walking?
[00:16:51.479 --> 00:16:59.764]  They need him like fish need water, like birds need the sky, like plants need the sun, and like vampires need blood.
[00:16:59.764 --> 00:17:10.151]  House Intelligence Committee chair has just come out and said no evidence yet of Trump campaign contacts with Russia because there never have been.
[00:17:10.151 --> 00:17:13.433]  I told you, they keep running and if you read the fine print in the New York Times,
[00:17:14.551 --> 00:17:18.215]  They always say no evidence that they actually were doing anything in the campaign.
[00:17:18.215 --> 00:17:20.758]  Just a few people in the campaign talked to Russians.
[00:17:20.758 --> 00:17:24.983]  That's what you do once they were in the transition.
[00:17:24.983 --> 00:17:25.704]  That's all coming up.
[00:17:27.176 --> 00:17:28.097]  But isn't it interesting?
[00:17:28.097 --> 00:17:33.303]  Secret ballots, duplicative envelopes, armed guards, and a star-studded finale.
[00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:36.426]  So how did the fine-tuned Oscar machine go so wrong?
[00:17:36.426 --> 00:17:48.019]  Well, armed guards, duplicate ballots, everything being checked, everything being totally controlled, obsessing over a vote that doesn't even matter, but you want people to be able to vote with no ID.
[00:17:50.492 --> 00:17:58.776]  There's a name for hypocrisy in the dictionary and the encyclopedia and it's called Hollywood liberal scum that isn't liberal.
[00:17:58.776 --> 00:18:06.681]  Everything about them is a lie.
[00:18:06.681 --> 00:18:13.004]  Coming up, we're going to have exclusive breaking news from inside the White House and information they've discovered.
[00:18:13.004 --> 00:18:15.025]  The article is going up now.
[00:18:15.025 --> 00:18:18.047]  In the next 10 minutes to InfoWars.com by Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:18:19.497 --> 00:18:37.883]  This is from the White House, that Obama raided Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac taxpayer-funded government-backed mortgage system, ladies and gentlemen, to fund Obamacare.
[00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:39.723]  It's even more bankrupt than we first thought.
[00:18:39.723 --> 00:18:42.484]  This is criminal, this is scandalous, and it's about to break.
[00:18:42.484 --> 00:18:44.025]  Guess what else we got from the White House?
[00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:51.826]  Along with 20 other groups, but no one's published it yet that I saw 15 minutes ago when we were going on air.
[00:18:51.826 --> 00:18:53.147]  This.
[00:18:53.147 --> 00:18:58.109]  The bullet points of the speech tomorrow night before Congress.
[00:18:58.109 --> 00:19:03.773]  The Democrats say they're going to sabotage and attack.
[00:19:03.773 --> 00:19:05.914]  I am going to be breaking all of this down.
[00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:09.316]  We're going to be posting this at InfoWars.com in the next 10 minutes as well.
[00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.932]  A lot of very positive things happened at CPAC when Dr. Corsi was there.
[00:19:18.932 --> 00:19:25.275]  So we're going to be breaking all that down.
[00:19:25.275 --> 00:19:26.716]  Here's the good news.
[00:19:26.716 --> 00:19:30.037]  Nationalists everywhere are exploding to the number one position.
[00:19:30.037 --> 00:19:36.601]  So the answer is assassination plots against Burleigh LePen, against Wilders in the Netherlands, everywhere.
[00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:43.164]  LePen's surge in latest poll, as the other people behind her's population slip.
[00:19:45.046 --> 00:19:48.927]  She's clearly, even in their fake polls, way ahead.
[00:19:48.927 --> 00:19:55.229]  Prime Minister May in the UK prepares to announce cut-off date for EU migrant rights in Britain.
[00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:59.330]  Yeah, they're just flooding England with undocumented people and just saying they have all these rights.
[00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.230]  No.
[00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.231]  There's a cut-off.
[00:20:01.231 --> 00:20:05.252]  It's a globalist plan by Peter Southerland and the UN to bring down Europe.
[00:20:05.252 --> 00:20:09.953]  Radical leftists are warning that Trump years will be apocalyptic and they just might be right.
[00:20:11.553 --> 00:20:16.075]  Report, Dem invited immigrants to heckle Trump during speech to Congress.
[00:20:16.075 --> 00:20:18.797]  Infowars.com.
[00:20:18.797 --> 00:20:20.298]  Now remember, one guy heckled.
[00:20:20.298 --> 00:20:23.319]  Who was the congressman, I forget, that says you lie?
[00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:24.260]  Let's Google that.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.480]  Which congressman said you lie?
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.381]  His name will pop in my head in a minute.
[00:20:26.381 --> 00:20:27.482]  He's been on the show before.
[00:20:27.482 --> 00:20:27.982]  Many years ago.
[00:20:29.107 --> 00:20:37.871]  The point is, is that he said, you lie when he was saying that illegals wouldn't get Obamacare and Obamacare is going to be free and all this crap.
[00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:39.492]  He said, you lie!
[00:20:39.492 --> 00:20:41.353]  The media was like, it's the greatest evil ever.
[00:20:41.353 --> 00:20:43.934]  Well, what about if there's heckling tomorrow night that we're going to be covering live?
[00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:44.514]  I'm going to be here.
[00:20:44.514 --> 00:20:45.895]  I'm going to cover it live.
[00:20:45.895 --> 00:20:46.956]  I'm going to come down here tomorrow night.
[00:20:46.956 --> 00:20:49.697]  We're going to cover an hour before and we'll cover the speech after.
[00:20:51.212 --> 00:20:54.737]  Leaked audio reveals anti-Trump forces manufacturing hostile town halls.
[00:20:54.737 --> 00:20:56.499]  Yeah, the media is telling them go there and do it.
[00:20:56.499 --> 00:21:04.370]  PolitiFact says Trump is right, but proceeds to rate his remarks mostly false.
[00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:05.852]  Trump blasts Dems for peddling fake...
[00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.091]  Russia News Narrative.
[00:21:08.091 --> 00:21:09.491]  That was over the weekend via Twitter.
[00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:13.233]  Now the Intelligence Committee comes out and says, okay, he's right.
[00:21:13.233 --> 00:21:13.793]  There's no evidence.
[00:21:13.793 --> 00:21:14.253]  We've seen it.
[00:21:14.253 --> 00:21:16.194]  That's why they wouldn't give it to the House.
[00:21:16.194 --> 00:21:21.796]  Two months ago, three months ago, when they were first saying this, they wouldn't give it to the House because there was no proof.
[00:21:21.796 --> 00:21:23.096]  I know the people they're blaming.
[00:21:23.096 --> 00:21:25.237]  They are literally pulling their hair out, angry.
[00:21:25.237 --> 00:21:27.918]  No contact to Russians.
[00:21:27.918 --> 00:21:29.479]  Zero.
[00:21:29.479 --> 00:21:35.041]  All they've got is Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador like he's supposed to do when he's the interim
[00:21:36.616 --> 00:21:39.498]  National Security Advisor.
[00:21:39.498 --> 00:21:40.779]  Already appointed by Trump.
[00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:44.682]  Didn't need to be confirmed by Congress.
[00:21:44.682 --> 00:21:48.886]  But oh my gosh, did you hear the President's National Security Advisor talk to the Russian Ambassador?
[00:21:48.886 --> 00:21:53.369]  What do you think Ambassadors and National Security Advisors do?
[00:21:53.369 --> 00:21:57.152]  The President could go meet for a week with Putin in Moscow if he wanted to.
[00:21:57.152 --> 00:21:58.033]  We elected him.
[00:21:58.033 --> 00:21:59.073]  He's the President.
[00:21:59.073 --> 00:22:00.635]  That's what they do.
[00:22:00.635 --> 00:22:01.315]  Can you believe it?
[00:22:01.315 --> 00:22:02.356]  He's talking to the Russians!
[00:22:02.356 --> 00:22:03.457]  Get a Russian agent!
[00:22:10.063 --> 00:22:11.524]  We've got so much to cover today.
[00:22:11.524 --> 00:22:14.566]  So much to go over.
[00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:16.747]  But first off, let me bring this out.
[00:22:16.747 --> 00:22:29.176]  There is a absolute undeclared war, but also declared war going on against free speech all over the country and all over the United States, but also all over the world.
[00:22:29.176 --> 00:22:31.557]  There is a massive sustained attack going on.
[00:22:31.557 --> 00:22:39.783]  And if you're simply aware of it, and if you simply speak out against it and take action against it, it will fall like a house of rotting cards.
[00:22:42.813 --> 00:22:47.691]  Now that said, if you're not conscious of that,
[00:22:49.079 --> 00:23:14.856]  And keep yourself in a spectator mode, where you're in the fight like you're watching a football game, but you're still a spectator and you don't spread the articles, spread the videos, promote the local radio stations, if you don't buy products from InfoWars or other people fighting the New World Order, if you don't start your own blog or your own YouTube or your own radio show, whatever it is, if you don't call C-SPAN, if you don't take those first steps, and I'm not complaining, it's going to be hard to win this.
[00:23:15.993 --> 00:23:18.695]  I'm just simply saying, it's a choice and it's up to you.
[00:23:18.695 --> 00:23:20.295]  You've already done amazing things.
[00:23:20.295 --> 00:23:24.578]  And the activists out there have done the work of hundreds of people, many of them individually.
[00:23:24.578 --> 00:23:26.019]  Or thousands of people.
[00:23:26.019 --> 00:23:34.303]  But we need all of you to keep your mind in the fight, your eye on the prize, and have that eye of the tiger, and never give up, never give in, never back down.
[00:23:34.303 --> 00:23:43.148]  Because, just because we got Trump in, means the war, as myself and Michael Savage and others said, has just begun.
[00:23:43.148 --> 00:23:44.629]  The fight has only just started.
[00:23:45.802 --> 00:23:47.063]  And they say that themselves.
[00:23:47.063 --> 00:23:48.484]  They are coming for us.
[00:23:48.484 --> 00:23:50.065]  The globalists are spending more money than ever.
[00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:51.907]  They're getting nastier than ever.
[00:23:51.907 --> 00:23:57.351]  They are doing unbelievable things, and we have to absolutely boycott everything they do.
[00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:00.474]  Just like Trump's not going to the Correspondents' Dinner, because it's all about him.
[00:24:00.474 --> 00:24:01.314]  Why should he?
[00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:05.718]  Just like he said, oh, we're going to have some press briefings where you don't always get in.
[00:24:05.718 --> 00:24:08.560]  We're going to make room for other media sometimes.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.841]  Exactly what I said.
[00:24:09.841 --> 00:24:11.683]  Have it be random.
[00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:14.205]  Where sometimes these groups get in, sometimes those groups get in.
[00:24:16.869 --> 00:24:20.091]  So we had Congressman, you know, Joe Wilson come out and say, you lie.
[00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:22.612]  That's exactly what Trump's doing from the main stage.
[00:24:22.612 --> 00:24:25.453]  When they lie, he says you lie.
[00:24:25.453 --> 00:24:34.317]  Last week he said, a lot of mainstream media puts out fake news, and fake news is the enemy of the American people.
[00:24:34.317 --> 00:24:38.939]  They said, he said, the news is the enemy, like he's a dictator.
[00:24:38.939 --> 00:24:40.860]  And he came out and he said, no, I said fake news.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:44.162]  See how they deceive, see how they lie.
[00:24:44.162 --> 00:24:46.303]  But the point is, you always wanted to bully pulpit.
[00:24:47.691 --> 00:24:50.391]  We finally have one in Donald J. Trump.
[00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:52.252]  You always wanted to take action against the globalists?
[00:24:52.252 --> 00:24:52.932]  We have it.
[00:24:52.932 --> 00:25:00.653]  But you and I and all of us have to get even more involved and more active in this animating contest.
[00:25:00.653 --> 00:25:16.096]  It's more important than ever that you wear your InfoWars.com shirts and Donald Trump shirts and Trump is my President shirts and Hillary for Prison shirts out in public so you meet each other, so we have solidarity, so we show these bullies and thugs and intimidators that we're awake and we know what's going on.
[00:25:17.062 --> 00:25:18.983]  And we're not backing down.
[00:25:18.983 --> 00:25:22.305]  It's amazing.
[00:25:22.305 --> 00:25:28.187]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, support the broadcast, get a t-shirt, wear your colors, loud and proud.
[00:25:28.187 --> 00:25:29.948]  Just like we're a motorcycle gang, folks.
[00:25:29.948 --> 00:25:33.330]  It's going back to the old-fashioned colors, old-fashioned militaries.
[00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.732]  We're the Army of the Republic, trying to restore the Republic, cut taxes for poor people.
[00:25:38.492 --> 00:25:43.915]  Private property, family values, national sovereignty, basic stuff like that.
[00:25:43.915 --> 00:25:50.259]  You gotta wear a Trump is my president shirt, a come and take it shirt, a Hillary for prison shirt, an InfoWars.com shirt.
[00:25:50.259 --> 00:25:53.181]  You know how powerful it is when Trump has these rallies?
[00:25:53.181 --> 00:25:55.282]  And the word is it isn't just going to be one mega rally.
[00:25:55.282 --> 00:25:59.064]  He's going to have lots of them again around the country because they're mobilizing against us.
[00:25:59.064 --> 00:26:02.706]  He's got to keep us mobilized in an info war against them.
[00:26:02.706 --> 00:26:05.388]  And you've got to have a uniform in the info war.
[00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:09.614]  You've got to be identifiable.
[00:26:09.614 --> 00:26:15.719]  Well, if that isn't a come and take it shirt or a Molon LaVey shirt, then I don't know what is.
[00:26:15.719 --> 00:26:17.541]  That's what it's all about.
[00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:21.084]  Rub it in their face.
[00:26:21.084 --> 00:26:24.367]  And support the broadcast and let us stay in contact with you.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.162]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:26:28.162 --> 00:26:33.186]  You get the latest videos, latest articles, and coupon codes that are the very, very biggest.
[00:26:33.186 --> 00:26:41.073]  In fact, we're gonna email out today one item that's one of our best sellers at 50% off at four o'clock in the afternoon today.
[00:26:41.073 --> 00:26:48.779]  I'm gonna send out a 50% discount to everyone that's on the newsletter.
[00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:52.302]  And every day we send out a promo code for the shopping cart
[00:26:53.396 --> 00:27:02.844]  So you can support the broadcast, get great products, but get the biggest discounts out there because if they start shutting us down on more platforms, which is starting to happen, we need to be able to contact you through email.
[00:27:02.844 --> 00:27:10.470]  This is the one area that for like 17 years, I never really collected emails and never did stuff professionally because I never was trying to grow.
[00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.612]  I realized that we've got to grow or be destroyed.
[00:27:12.612 --> 00:27:21.900]  We've got to get as big as possible to take these people on because then if they attack, it will be so large that it takes them too long to take us down and we'll wear them out.
[00:27:22.714 --> 00:27:24.254]  I mean business, folks.
[00:27:24.254 --> 00:27:26.835]  And people will see more in the future, as you've seen.
[00:27:26.835 --> 00:27:28.736]  I keep telling you we're going to the next level, and we do.
[00:27:28.736 --> 00:27:34.978]  With your prayers and your financial support, even more importantly, spreading the video links and the articles.
[00:27:34.978 --> 00:27:36.738]  We're unstoppable together.
[00:27:36.738 --> 00:27:46.381]  Americans of every color and creed, of one race, of one God, of one freedom, of one push for justice, are unstoppable when we take action.
[00:27:46.381 --> 00:27:49.962]  As President Trump has said, and you're doing it, and you're seeing how we're unstoppable.
[00:27:51.087 --> 00:28:00.454]  The idiots at the Oscars went out there and made fun of Trump, called him a racist, talked about him having bowel movements, all this other crud all day long, had a big celebration of division and lies and fraud.
[00:28:00.454 --> 00:28:14.464]  Distracting from all their elitism, projecting it onto Trump when he's a great unifier, and then they couldn't even get the right best picture together.
[00:28:16.263 --> 00:28:19.465]  So, InfoWars newsletter is the open channel for truth.
[00:28:19.465 --> 00:28:23.187]  The establishment is launching salvo against those who oppose their agenda.
[00:28:23.187 --> 00:28:24.187]  You see it everywhere.
[00:28:24.187 --> 00:28:27.449]  The latest advertising ban on InfoWars, not letting us advertise on Google.
[00:28:27.449 --> 00:28:28.529]  That's huge.
[00:28:28.529 --> 00:28:29.690]  That's blocking us in the market.
[00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:30.611]  Very serious.
[00:28:30.611 --> 00:28:34.613]  It's proof that they are using sophisticated tactics to attack free speech and destroy the independent media.

[00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:17.219]  As well, I'm extending the big sale we had last week to fund the First Amendment and expanding the Info War, at least keeping it the size it is.
[00:29:17.219 --> 00:29:23.164]  With super metal vitality 25% off, brain force 25% off, survival shield 25% off, caveman 33% off.

[00:29:44.079 --> 00:29:44.740]  Amazing.

[00:29:47.061 --> 00:29:48.402]  Please support the broadcast.
[00:29:48.402 --> 00:29:49.563]  Thank you for your support.
[00:29:49.563 --> 00:29:52.504]  We'll be back.
[00:29:52.504 --> 00:29:55.166]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.758 --> 00:30:05.681]  The United States foreign policy and engagement with Syria has been a disaster, and it may start and end with John McCain.
[00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:09.662]  Four years, McCain has been a buffer between the Middle East and the United States.
[00:30:09.662 --> 00:30:11.723]  McCain took a rare trip to Syria in 2013.
[00:30:11.723 --> 00:30:15.425]  He met with so-called moderate rebels Obama was bankrolling and arming.
[00:30:15.425 --> 00:30:18.546]  It turned out that these moderate rebels were the ones destabilizing the region.
[00:30:18.866 --> 00:30:20.428]  And could even be tied to ISIS.
[00:30:20.428 --> 00:30:27.254]  But of course, this would fit the foreign policy of the Obama administration and the Clinton State Department, which wanted Bashar Assad removed from power.
[00:30:27.254 --> 00:30:30.477]  Last week, McCain took another rare and secret trip to Syria.
[00:30:30.477 --> 00:30:33.400]  A spokesperson for McCain said he was there to visit with U.S.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.142]  ground forces to discuss plans to defeat ISIL.
[00:30:36.142 --> 00:30:38.505]  ISIL, not ISIS, they were sure to clarify.
[00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:39.786]  Now, how coincidental,
[00:30:40.146 --> 00:30:44.608]  Upon McCain's return to the U.S., news stories everywhere are talking about more U.S.
[00:30:44.608 --> 00:30:46.389]  ground forces being sent to Syria.
[00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:50.331]  John McCain is a detriment to our nation, the Middle East, and peace on this planet.
[00:30:50.331 --> 00:30:56.714]  He needs to be removed from any unelected duties, and it is upon the people in the great state of Arizona to rid us of this warmonger.
[00:30:56.714 --> 00:30:58.755]  For InfoWars.com, I'm Owen Schroer.
[00:30:59.495 --> 00:31:04.557]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[00:31:50.194 --> 00:31:56.496]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Longevity and the products at Infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[00:31:56.496 --> 00:31:57.797]  Check it out for yourself today.
[00:31:59.574 --> 00:32:01.395]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:01.395 --> 00:32:07.998]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:07.998 --> 00:32:11.159]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:11.159 --> 00:32:20.943]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[00:32:20.943 --> 00:32:21.784]  Caveman.
[00:32:21.784 --> 00:32:26.866]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:26.866 --> 00:32:28.967]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:29.267 --> 00:32:32.429]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:32.429 --> 00:32:37.572]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:37.572 --> 00:32:45.717]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:45.717 --> 00:32:53.561]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:53.561 --> 00:32:58.304]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and 4WarsLife.com today.
[00:33:01.078 --> 00:33:11.606]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:11.606 --> 00:33:18.091]  Cut me in, I'm alive tonight, out on the streets again.
[00:33:18.091 --> 00:33:25.156]  Turn me on, I'm high tonight, something you'll never forget.
[00:33:36.055 --> 00:33:52.825]  See, it's so easy to reach out and heal.
[00:33:52.825 --> 00:33:59.469]  And I want to say, maybe this is not a popular thing to say, but I want to say thank you to President Trump.
[00:33:59.469 --> 00:34:02.411]  I mean, remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?
[00:34:04.164 --> 00:34:05.085]  La La Land.
[00:34:05.085 --> 00:34:09.348]  That's where you find progress.
[00:34:09.348 --> 00:34:11.069]  We lost, by the way.
[00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:12.050]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.111]  No.
[00:34:13.111 --> 00:34:14.692]  There's a mistake.
[00:34:14.692 --> 00:34:18.154]  Moonlight, you guys won Best Picture.
[00:34:18.154 --> 00:34:31.164]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's the Garbage Skeksy Awards, where a bunch of weirdo, arrogant, fake people that play fake people, that play being disingenuous in the real world,
[00:34:32.267 --> 00:34:37.391]  Come out and engage in mass fraud and deception against our country.
[00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:41.295]  It is truly, truly sickening.
[00:34:41.295 --> 00:34:51.584]  We have a Breitbart senior editor, Joel B. Pollack, joining us.
[00:34:51.584 --> 00:34:54.566]  He wrote the book with the number one New York Times bestselling author, Larry
[00:34:55.572 --> 00:34:59.294]  Schwickert, How Trump Won the Inside Story of a Revolution.
[00:34:59.294 --> 00:35:03.876]  We're selling this book, I should add, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:35:03.876 --> 00:35:08.478]  And knowing how Trump won is key to future victories, isn't it?
[00:35:08.478 --> 00:35:19.364]  But again, if you really want to defeat these gun grabbers, if you really want to defeat the people who think your children belong to them, it means you've got to be willing to go out in public, you've got to get aggressive, and you've got to financially support the opposition of the New World Order.
[00:35:19.364 --> 00:35:21.785]  Because we're real opposition.
[00:35:21.785 --> 00:35:23.966]  We're hair on fire attacking them.
[00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.412]  We're not playing games.
[00:35:27.412 --> 00:35:29.873]  And they think we're going to be intimidated or shut up.
[00:35:29.873 --> 00:35:31.455]  They got another thing coming.
[00:35:31.455 --> 00:35:32.255]  So that's coming up.
[00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:40.121]  And then I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of that hour for the next hour and a half and take your phone calls.
[00:35:40.121 --> 00:35:41.522]  I promise I'm going to take a lot of them.
[00:35:41.522 --> 00:35:42.343]  I took a lot last night.
[00:35:42.343 --> 00:35:43.443]  They were great calls.
[00:35:43.443 --> 00:35:44.224]  They were on target.
[00:35:44.224 --> 00:35:44.924]  They were amazing.
[00:35:44.924 --> 00:35:46.005]  They brought up really good points.
[00:35:46.005 --> 00:35:48.347]  We're going to take your calls again today.
[00:35:48.347 --> 00:35:50.649]  David Knight's going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:53.431]  We've got like an eight minute report I did that's very informative.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:59.799]  The truth about Donald Trump and Satanism, where the Satanist and the Occultist have all come out against Trump.
[00:35:59.799 --> 00:36:01.859]  Mainstream media has promoted it.
[00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:04.840]  They say do witchcraft against him, call for his death.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.721]  That's been promoted in major newspapers.
[00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:08.621]  That shows you who these people really are.
[00:36:08.621 --> 00:36:12.923]  I told you, you scratch an Atheist, you get a Satanist.
[00:36:12.923 --> 00:36:16.944]  And I do not mean your average run-of-the-mill Atheist on the ground.
[00:36:18.533 --> 00:36:24.599]  I totally get atheists that have seen these fake churches and these hypocrites and these globalists and think, I want nothing to do with that.
[00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:28.122]  You know, religion has turned into a cult of control.
[00:36:28.122 --> 00:36:29.844]  I'm not talking about state-run religion.
[00:36:29.844 --> 00:36:34.849]  I'm talking about the spiritual realm, the dimensions, mathematics have proven it.
[00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:37.572]  All these different top mathematicians end up becoming religious.
[00:36:38.823 --> 00:36:42.865]  Or spiritual, I should say, because there's something else going on.
[00:36:42.865 --> 00:36:51.411]  We're on a planet in deep space, folks, and if you get into history and you get into what the top people are into, they're into the occult.
[00:36:51.411 --> 00:36:56.294]  And there's a light side, there's a dark side to this, and you're at your great peril if you ignore it.
[00:36:56.294 --> 00:36:59.916]  It's a fact.
[00:36:59.916 --> 00:37:01.677]  Now, I've got so much to get to here.
[00:37:05.549 --> 00:37:08.650]  One story's up on Infowars.com and just went up, as I said it did.
[00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:10.110]  The other big one is going up.
[00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.510]  It's going to be red-linked very, very soon.
[00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:21.372]  Dealing with the fact that Obama raided Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the big government-backed loan system, to fund Obamacare.
[00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:23.253]  That is absolutely illegal.
[00:37:23.253 --> 00:37:25.133]  Completely out of control.
[00:37:25.133 --> 00:37:27.714]  And there's an image I want to put up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:37:27.714 --> 00:37:32.575]  It's up on Infowars.com as today's editorial cartoon.
[00:37:32.575 --> 00:37:33.895]  And it says it all.
[00:37:36.917 --> 00:37:52.452]  It's a doctor looking at an x-ray in a medical office and Uncle Sam is sitting on the table, on the exam table, with a giant octopus called Obamacare as a face sucker wrapped around him, suffocating him with one tentacle around the GOP.
[00:37:54.528 --> 00:38:03.563]  Actually, it should be that the giant thing on the face of Uncle Sam is the GOP and Democratic Party that are the octopus who created Obamacare.
[00:38:03.563 --> 00:38:08.271]  It's a giant ripoff for insurance companies and big banks to double and triple prices and make you buy their product.
[00:38:10.094 --> 00:38:16.617]  And the octopus should be saying to Trump, who's trying to pull it off of Uncle Sam, the American people, that no, you're never going to stop me.
[00:38:16.617 --> 00:38:17.917]  This is my dinner.
[00:38:17.917 --> 00:38:18.877]  I own this country.
[00:38:18.877 --> 00:38:19.738]  I own their souls.
[00:38:19.738 --> 00:38:20.898]  Get out of my way.
[00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:26.440]  But still, hmm, removing it may take a little longer than we thought.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.441]  Yeah, because they're saying everyone must be covered.
[00:38:28.441 --> 00:38:31.922]  People are always covered under charity care and churches and local systems.
[00:38:31.922 --> 00:38:34.723]  Why do you think almost all major hospitals are owned by big churches?
[00:38:37.025 --> 00:38:45.172]  By the Seventh-day Adventists, by the Catholics and others, because they're supposed to give out most health care for free, and doctors are supposed to give out 30%.
[00:38:45.172 --> 00:38:50.776]  When my dad went to medical school, 30% of it was supposed to be free.
[00:38:50.776 --> 00:39:01.645]  People say, oh, Ron Paul's so great, he used to work two days a week at a charity hospital for $2 a night to pay for his gas and his food.
[00:39:02.987 --> 00:39:09.090]  $2 a night delivering up to three babies a night while Ron Paul was such a saint.
[00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:09.511]  And you know what?
[00:39:09.511 --> 00:39:12.392]  He was one of the last type of doctors that still did that.
[00:39:12.392 --> 00:39:16.694]  But he only got out of being a doctor 20 years ago.
[00:39:16.694 --> 00:39:18.656]  23 years ago.
[00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:26.720]  Ron Paul knew you went to charity hospitals and you did stuff for free.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.141]  But see, charity hospitals aren't charity hospitals.
[00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:32.223]  They're big old giant corrupt institutions on average now.
[00:39:33.322 --> 00:39:41.205]  But see, I'm cursed with having medical people in my family who also are in major medical management, in some cases, of hundreds of facilities.
[00:39:41.205 --> 00:39:41.826]  Hundreds!
[00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:47.188]  When my dad retired three years ago, he was managing over a hundred facilities.
[00:39:47.188 --> 00:39:51.670]  My dad gets called in to testify in the legislature on laws, you name it.
[00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.952]  Terms he developed are actually used in Texas law now.
[00:39:55.952 --> 00:39:58.173]  And I'm not bragging, I'm just explaining.
[00:39:58.173 --> 00:40:00.454]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:40:03.507 --> 00:40:05.348]  When I tell you Obamacare is a giant screw job.
[00:40:05.348 --> 00:40:06.749]  But that's okay.
[00:40:06.749 --> 00:40:12.531]  MSNBC just said it's free and Alex Jones is deeply racist and that's why folks don't like it.
[00:40:12.531 --> 00:40:14.032]  Is the article up on Infowars.com yet?
[00:40:15.225 --> 00:40:17.046]  I know it was supposed to be ready a while ago.
[00:40:17.046 --> 00:40:26.090]  Let's hit refresh and see if that article's up there, because we were just getting it ready for publication by Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:29.471]  Dealing with this, because we're going to cover it as soon as it's ready.
[00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:32.232]  But breaking bullet points of Trump's congressional address.
[00:40:32.232 --> 00:40:33.573]  Give him an info order if you want to go see that.
[00:40:37.284 --> 00:40:41.028]  And I'm going to get to a bunch of other news after we air this special report.
[00:40:41.028 --> 00:40:47.854]  I'm going to play this special report, Liberal Hollywood Attacks Trump by John Bowne.
[00:40:47.854 --> 00:40:51.017]  And just remember, these are the people who think they own you, they own your family.
[00:40:51.017 --> 00:40:56.442]  But the beautiful thing is, whether it's Jimmy Kimmel or any of these people, their ratings are down.
[00:40:56.442 --> 00:40:57.563]  Most people don't like them.
[00:40:57.563 --> 00:40:58.844]  Almost everyone is sick of them.
[00:40:59.858 --> 00:41:06.543]  There are comics that are 14 years old, again on YouTube, that have more views every day than Jimmy Kimmel and all these other people combined have.
[00:41:06.543 --> 00:41:07.663]  They're a joke.
[00:41:07.663 --> 00:41:13.968]  And no amount of internet censorship, no amount of tyranny will ever put you back in control of the American people again.
[00:41:13.968 --> 00:41:20.733]  You know, I notice who mainly watches Jimmy Kimmel and Colbert and it's old people.
[00:41:20.733 --> 00:41:24.075]  And nothing against old people, but it's old people that think it's hip and cool.
[00:41:26.482 --> 00:41:27.202]  That's all you've got.
[00:41:27.202 --> 00:41:28.903]  That's all Fox News has got.
[00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:30.463]  It's all any of you have.
[00:41:30.463 --> 00:41:44.887]  No one under the age of 45 that I know believes anything that comes out of your mouth unless they're adult social justice warriors that have been brainwashed by the educational system and have giant stinking chips on their shoulders.
[00:41:44.887 --> 00:41:45.428]  That's it.
[00:41:45.428 --> 00:41:46.488]  That's the only people.
[00:41:46.488 --> 00:41:46.908]  That's all.
[00:41:50.083 --> 00:41:55.107]  So just realize, they're always talking about how they're cool and everybody else is dumb but them.
[00:41:55.107 --> 00:42:03.093]  It's because the globalists and their minions are so uncool and so establishment and then all they've got is the very dumbest constituents.
[00:42:04.275 --> 00:42:16.665]  Unless they're constituents, because they're part of the gravy train feeding on the dumb mass of people, and they want to grow a bigger mass of dumb people that they siphon off of, that they use as a political weapon against the dwindling middle class.
[00:42:16.665 --> 00:42:23.351]  And these parasites, just like all the failed wannabes that went to California to make it big, California's now imploding.
[00:42:23.351 --> 00:42:29.356]  So all those failures are now running to Toronto, and running to Austin, Texas, and ruining everything there.
[00:42:32.389 --> 00:42:37.931]  Like locusts flying into a field and stripping everything off the plants in minutes.
[00:42:37.931 --> 00:42:39.952]  They are the plague.
[00:42:39.952 --> 00:42:43.974]  And they come to dominate, they come to control, they come to bully.
[00:42:43.974 --> 00:42:45.595]  They're a bunch of gangsters.
[00:42:45.595 --> 00:42:48.836]  What they are is wimp gangs.
[00:42:48.836 --> 00:42:54.619]  Guilt gangs that are there to guilt you into submission and worshipping them.
[00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:58.981]  So let's go to this report by John Bowne.
[00:42:58.981 --> 00:42:59.321]  Here it is.
[00:43:00.237 --> 00:43:11.606]  Anti-Trump celebrities joined forces at the United Voices rally staged by Hollywood's United Talent Agency in lieu of its usual pre-Oscar party.
[00:43:11.606 --> 00:43:13.628]  It's our time to resist.
[00:43:13.628 --> 00:43:23.735]  It's our time to show up and demand answers.
[00:43:23.735 --> 00:43:27.999]  It's our time to tell our elected officials to do their job.
[00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:36.232]  We will not tolerate chaos, ineptitude, and war-mongering.
[00:43:36.232 --> 00:43:42.734]  While other celebrities resorted to calling on the demons that run their lives to alter America's destiny.
[00:43:42.734 --> 00:43:48.076]  Witches across the country were gathering at the stroke of midnight to put a hex on President Trump.
[00:43:48.076 --> 00:43:49.136]  Did you see this?
[00:43:49.136 --> 00:43:50.396]  That's very good.
[00:43:50.396 --> 00:43:52.417]  Why, Donald J. Trump?
[00:43:54.864 --> 00:43:56.705]  Find their wickedness!
[00:43:56.705 --> 00:43:59.928]  Find their wickedness!
[00:43:59.928 --> 00:44:06.472]  The 2017 Oscars were, of course, an opportunity for all of Hollywood to bash their commander-in-chief.
[00:44:06.472 --> 00:44:08.334]  But I want to say thank you to President Trump.
[00:44:08.334 --> 00:44:13.638]  I mean, remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?
[00:44:13.638 --> 00:44:18.181]  Everybody, please join me in giving Meryl Streep a totally undeserved round of applause, will you?
[00:44:25.177 --> 00:44:33.563]  According to these globalist pawns, the silent majority of Americans who voted Donald Trump into the executive office are wrong.
[00:44:33.563 --> 00:44:45.230]  While an industry that can't get enough of its own celebrity assumes, like Congress and the mainstream media, that Americans are foolish enough to support their limousine leftist opinions.
[00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:51.134]  All this from a tiny city in liberal hell, California, that is fast becoming an outpost
[00:44:51.514 --> 00:45:02.518]  Hollywood is set to begin work on Little America, a dystopian adventure movie set in a future where a Trump-like U.S.
[00:45:02.518 --> 00:45:07.820]  president has bankrupted America and China has called in its debts.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:16.203]  China views film as a component of social control, states a report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
[00:45:16.403 --> 00:45:26.211]  Noting that when it comes to Chinese policies for regulating movies, these Chinese Communist Party concerns are positioned above all other interests.
[00:45:26.211 --> 00:45:28.292]  The country is divided right now.
[00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:29.333]  I've been getting a lot of advice.
[00:45:29.333 --> 00:45:31.455]  People have been telling me it's time to bring everyone together.
[00:45:31.455 --> 00:45:33.776]  You need to say something to unite us.
[00:45:33.776 --> 00:45:37.479]  And... Let's just get something straight off the top.
[00:45:37.479 --> 00:45:39.100]  I'm not... I can't do that.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:44.024]  That's not... There's only one Braveheart in this room, and he's not gonna unite us either.
[00:45:44.024 --> 00:45:45.045]  Okay?
[00:45:50.615 --> 00:45:51.495]  No, you look great.
[00:45:51.495 --> 00:45:53.236]  I think the Scientology is working.
[00:45:53.236 --> 00:45:55.537]  I really do.
[00:45:55.537 --> 00:46:03.661]  Hollywood is slitting its own throat, assuming by the authority of its own arrogance that Americans actually care what it thinks.
[00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:04.541]  You're not God.
[00:46:04.541 --> 00:46:10.924]  There are 14-year-old YouTubers that have more viewers every day than all of CNN combined.
[00:46:10.924 --> 00:46:16.346]  We certainly have more viewers and listeners here every week on average than CNN does.
[00:46:16.346 --> 00:46:17.987]  They are a complete hoax.
[00:46:19.557 --> 00:46:28.196]  And so Trump says you want to have CNN, you want to have the Washington Post, Newsweek, Time Magazine, all calling for civil insurrection, overthrow, murder of the president.
[00:46:28.834 --> 00:46:37.317]  You want to boycott and financially block anybody on YouTube or Google or Facebook trying to promote the president's ideas of bringing our jobs back?
[00:46:37.317 --> 00:46:41.159]  Well, the president's going to start blocking you, bullies.
[00:46:41.159 --> 00:46:43.580]  We're only calling for his death.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.000]  We're only calling him a Nazi.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.162]  We're only lying about him when he says fake news is the enemy of the American people.
[00:46:50.162 --> 00:46:51.163]  They come out and say that you're here.
[00:46:52.023 --> 00:46:55.485]  President Trump says all media and questioning him is the enemy.
[00:46:55.485 --> 00:46:57.606]  That's how a dictator talks.
[00:46:57.606 --> 00:46:59.967]  Trump gives a speech and goes, I didn't do that.
[00:46:59.967 --> 00:47:03.048]  I said fake news is the enemy and that's my free speech.
[00:47:03.048 --> 00:47:04.889]  You're calling for me to be killed.
[00:47:04.889 --> 00:47:08.510]  The real celebrities are the inventors of this republic.
[00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:12.052]  The founding fathers of the United States of America.
[00:47:12.052 --> 00:47:13.833]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:47:16.261 --> 00:47:19.647]  Alright, we're going to tweet this out at real Alex Jones during the next break.
[00:47:19.647 --> 00:47:21.890]  It needs to be spread far and wide.
[00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:25.035]  You want to get rid of Obamacare, you got to keep the heat on it.
[00:47:25.035 --> 00:47:27.719]  Because the media and the Republican Party on Fox News.
[00:47:29.912 --> 00:47:37.795]  Are already involved in frontal assaults via the Democrats, but backhanded assaults via the Republicans, saying, oh, what's Trump going to do?
[00:47:37.795 --> 00:47:39.796]  If we don't have Obamacare, it'll really hurt people.
[00:47:39.796 --> 00:47:41.357]  There's some good parts of it.
[00:47:41.357 --> 00:47:46.919]  Oh, look, he's not getting rid of it right away as he goes full steam ahead trying to repeal it.
[00:47:46.919 --> 00:47:53.081]  And he's already delivered on more good things than Ronald Reagan did in eight years, in 40 something days.
[00:47:53.081 --> 00:47:54.042]  It's unbelievable.
[00:47:54.042 --> 00:47:54.942]  If you think about everything he's done.
[00:47:56.601 --> 00:47:59.985]  And again, they're trying to stall the Trump recovery.
[00:47:59.985 --> 00:48:01.587]  They're trying to create a global recession.
[00:48:01.587 --> 00:48:03.630]  They're trying to create a retail crisis.
[00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.495]  They're trying to stall small businesses right now.
[00:48:07.495 --> 00:48:14.043]  And Trump is desperately trying to get the Federal Reserve and removing the Federal Reserve folks, but this week and putting in his own people.
[00:48:15.578 --> 00:48:18.619]  To get loans to small businesses as fast as he can.
[00:48:18.619 --> 00:48:24.641]  So if he's unable to do this, as Ron Paul said on the air here a month ago, it was too little, too late.
[00:48:24.641 --> 00:48:33.104]  Even though he said, quote, Trump's doing a great job cutting regulations and trying to cut taxes and everything else he's announced, but I think it's too little, too late.
[00:48:33.104 --> 00:48:36.125]  So remember that, everybody, that hates Trump.
[00:48:36.125 --> 00:48:39.287]  Just keep working against him as hard as you can.
[00:48:39.287 --> 00:48:42.608]  The Hollywood elitists, when you're homeless, aren't going to bring you into their homes.
[00:48:43.564 --> 00:48:46.886]  Now here's the big exclusive up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:46.886 --> 00:48:52.609]  Obama illegally robbed Fannie Freddie to fund Obamacare.
[00:48:52.609 --> 00:48:59.852]  Breaking at Infowars.com by Dr. Jerome R. Corsi right now.
[00:48:59.852 --> 00:49:06.596]  Obama diverted money from low-income housing to keep Obamacare alive.
[00:49:06.596 --> 00:49:12.339]  Will this be the final nail in the coffin for the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obozo ripoff care?
[00:49:14.105 --> 00:49:15.226]  Or Megabank care?
[00:49:15.226 --> 00:49:17.388]  Megabank looting care?
[00:49:17.388 --> 00:49:28.496]  Federal court litigation provides evidence that Obama administration legally diverted taxpayer funds that had not been appropriated by Congress in an unconstitutional scheme to keep Obamacare from imploding.
[00:49:28.496 --> 00:49:32.059]  You gotta give those foreign banks to put you in office all that money.
[00:49:32.059 --> 00:49:33.700]  In 2016, a U.S.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:41.886]  District Judge caught the Obama administration Health and Human Services Department acting unconstitutionally and therefore put an end to the illegal diversion of taxpayer funds.
[00:49:41.886 --> 00:49:43.568]  But the Obamas didn't stop there.
[00:49:44.701 --> 00:49:47.610]  This is exclusive, folks.
[00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.576]  This was pointed out to us by the White House.
[00:49:49.576 --> 00:49:50.519]  This came from the White House.
[00:49:51.391 --> 00:49:53.553]  Well, the mainstream media will have a fit with that.
[00:49:53.553 --> 00:50:15.155]  The Obama administration instead turned to the nation's two government-sponsored mortgage giants, the Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, commonly known as Freddie Mac, to invent a new version of funds in a desperate attempt to keep Obamacare, that is foreign bank looting, from collapsing.
[00:50:16.727 --> 00:50:20.449]  A key date in May 12, 2016, that was the day when the U.S.
[00:50:20.449 --> 00:50:23.710]  District Judge Rosemary Collier, in the case of U.S.
[00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:36.855]  House of Representatives v. Burwell, as it all listed, ruled against health and, turn the page, Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell.
[00:50:36.855 --> 00:50:37.875]  And then the judge goes through it.
[00:50:37.875 --> 00:50:39.836]  It's a lengthy article with all the documents.
[00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:44.538]  It was estimated hundreds of billions of dollars slagged off of these people.
[00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:50.111]  Which is, again, taxpayers at another level paying for it.
[00:50:50.111 --> 00:50:52.171]  All the massive taxes weren't enough already given to it.
[00:50:52.171 --> 00:50:59.754]  All the penalties weren't enough to pay for all the massive increases in health care costs in the giant blood-letting vampire feast.
[00:50:59.754 --> 00:51:01.315]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[00:51:01.315 --> 00:51:04.596]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[00:51:04.596 --> 00:51:06.117]  The world is in turmoil.
[00:51:06.117 --> 00:51:10.639]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[00:51:10.639 --> 00:51:13.380]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.721]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:22.142]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[00:51:22.142 --> 00:51:25.022]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[00:51:25.022 --> 00:51:28.723]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[00:51:28.723 --> 00:51:31.264]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[00:51:31.264 --> 00:51:34.865]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[00:51:34.865 --> 00:51:36.965]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat.
[00:51:37.245 --> 00:51:40.007]  And it lasts up to 25 years.
[00:51:40.007 --> 00:51:42.068]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[00:51:42.068 --> 00:51:46.451]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.
[00:51:46.451 --> 00:51:49.012]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-763-5999.
[00:51:49.012 --> 00:51:50.013]  That's HarvestRight.com or 800-763-5999.
[00:51:59.278 --> 00:52:04.880]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's, in an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.281]  In the early 1980s, a child was born.
[00:52:07.281 --> 00:52:08.222]  Two of them, actually.
[00:52:08.222 --> 00:52:10.282]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[00:52:10.282 --> 00:52:14.664]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[00:52:14.664 --> 00:52:16.785]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[00:52:17.265 --> 00:52:21.249]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[00:52:21.249 --> 00:52:30.196]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging to wreck the customers.
[00:52:30.196 --> 00:52:32.538]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[00:52:32.538 --> 00:52:34.080]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:35.400]  Don't worry.

[00:53:47.344 --> 00:53:50.105]  Flee the city and seek refuge in the American redoubt.

[00:54:00.527 --> 00:54:07.351]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man.
[00:54:07.351 --> 00:54:15.216]  To be the sad man behind blue eyes.
[00:54:15.216 --> 00:54:22.420]  No one knows what it's like to be hated.
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:24.342]  To be faded.
[00:54:24.342 --> 00:54:25.782]  To telling only lies.
[00:54:25.782 --> 00:54:27.984]  To telling only lies.
[00:54:30.394 --> 00:54:37.660]  And how do the dreams of humanity manifest?
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:42.084]  The world has its psychopaths.
[00:54:42.084 --> 00:54:48.430]  Then it has the dreamers.
[00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:49.772]  Only lonely.
[00:54:49.772 --> 00:54:50.492]  Never free.
[00:54:58.804 --> 00:55:04.447]  The crew was back there in the last 15 minutes or so since they had this article ready for me, reading it, freaking out.
[00:55:04.447 --> 00:55:08.168]  All the documents, the court cases, no one's ever reported on this.
[00:55:08.168 --> 00:55:09.409]  This is hiding in plain view.
[00:55:09.409 --> 00:55:16.992]  The White House has been alerting other media to this in the last three days, and we're the first to put it out.
[00:55:16.992 --> 00:55:18.033]  The White House is like, hey,
[00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:20.370]  Look at this.
[00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:22.191]  Infowars, Breitbart, Daily Caller.
[00:55:22.191 --> 00:55:23.851]  I'm not blaming Breitbart, Daily Caller.
[00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:26.112]  No one's gotten around to it yet because it's banking.
[00:55:26.112 --> 00:55:30.133]  Well, Dr. Corsi has a degree in finance from Harvard and is an expert in banking.
[00:55:30.133 --> 00:55:32.554]  That's how he met Trump 42 years ago.
[00:55:32.554 --> 00:55:35.675]  Was working with him on financing for hotels.
[00:55:35.675 --> 00:55:37.335]  The two know each other very well.
[00:55:37.335 --> 00:55:39.256]  Probably had dinner 50 times over the years.
[00:55:39.256 --> 00:55:41.037]  Had dinner last year.
[00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:41.917]  The point is...
[00:55:43.211 --> 00:55:48.513]  That Infowars has a giant story that the White House thinks is important.
[00:55:48.513 --> 00:55:52.595]  And the crew is reading this, and I know why the other sites haven't gotten around to it yet.
[00:55:52.595 --> 00:55:53.695]  It's some heavy reading.
[00:55:53.695 --> 00:55:55.896]  It's documents, it's court cases.
[00:55:55.896 --> 00:56:03.339]  Remember how they first got rid of regulations for housing loans in the 90s?
[00:56:03.339 --> 00:56:04.280]  That created a bubble.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:08.882]  Then when it imploded, they made it way hard for smaller brokerage firms and other groups to actually, you know,
[00:56:09.639 --> 00:56:11.820]  Go out and do the deals for houses.
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:14.862]  They create all these new fees and fines and Frank Dodd.
[00:56:14.862 --> 00:56:28.589]  That made it so they could then, behind the scenes, loot the hell out of the money upwards of 10% of what comes through the two federal management groups.
[00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:32.411]  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:36.353]  Or Fannie and Freddie, as I like to call them.
[00:56:37.273 --> 00:56:38.194]  So you read this.
[00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:39.455]  It is incredible.
[00:56:39.455 --> 00:56:42.817]  It's a long article.
[00:56:42.817 --> 00:56:49.623]  They call it their pot of gold and just looted the hell out of it.
[00:56:49.623 --> 00:56:51.625]  They've got unsealed court documents in here.
[00:56:51.625 --> 00:56:56.008]  And my problem is I don't even have the support crew for Corsi yet.
[00:56:56.008 --> 00:56:56.949]  So he writes this stuff.
[00:56:56.949 --> 00:56:59.090]  We've got links to the documents in the Federal Register.
[00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:00.972]  We need to get some screenshots, obviously, of these.
[00:57:00.972 --> 00:57:02.073]  At least the headers of them.
[00:57:02.073 --> 00:57:04.515]  Put them in the article just so folks can see this for yourself.
[00:57:08.903 --> 00:57:17.488]  187 billion dollars in funds advanced to Obamacare through the Housing and Economic Recovery Act.
[00:57:17.488 --> 00:57:20.790]  Wow, just robbing the HERA.
[00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:25.033]  Man, this is so criminal.
[00:57:25.033 --> 00:57:31.137]  And the federal government, convertible, selling off the stock of GSE.
[00:57:31.137 --> 00:57:32.558]  Man, this is so criminal.
[00:57:33.834 --> 00:57:38.779]  But so is opening the border up and saying people with TB and leprosy can come over and you don't even check them.
[00:57:38.779 --> 00:57:42.443]  That's mean to the person you don't give treatment to.
[00:57:42.443 --> 00:57:45.866]  It's just total lawless, insane criminality.
[00:57:45.866 --> 00:57:48.990]  And then you've got the establishment Republicans trying to keep Obamacare in place.
[00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.891]  Of course they are.
[00:57:49.891 --> 00:57:53.494]  They helped write it for the very same megabanks that are raping everybody.
[00:57:53.494 --> 00:57:55.056]  These stories are so important.
[00:57:56.468 --> 00:57:58.629]  See, we haven't won the war yet to get rid of Obamacare.
[00:57:58.629 --> 00:57:59.890]  It's the big enchilada.
[00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.510]  It's the thing that'll bring down our economy.
[00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:03.491]  It's the thing that brings us under total control of the government.
[00:58:03.491 --> 00:58:09.434]  But Trump, with executive orders, can block executive areas that are unconstitutional.
[00:58:09.434 --> 00:58:15.837]  So he's ordered the IRS not to enforce that, so you don't have to put on your tax return, you know, that information that, oh, I don't have Obamacare.
[00:58:15.837 --> 00:58:16.557]  You don't have to fill it out.
[00:58:18.484 --> 00:58:20.288]  It's illegal for them to ask you that now.
[00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:21.410]  They need to change the forms.
[00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:22.692]  They haven't done that yet.
[00:58:22.692 --> 00:58:26.159]  But they're kind of acting like they're following what Trump says, hoping he doesn't notice.
[00:58:26.159 --> 00:58:26.820]  But he's on it!
[00:58:27.628 --> 00:58:30.470]  So already, that fine is gone.
[00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:34.513]  But a lot of companies are claiming they'll take it out of their people's own, you know, paycheck.
[00:58:34.513 --> 00:58:35.573]  It's incredible.
[00:58:35.573 --> 00:58:39.716]  Again, the whole system is trying to ignore Trump, the law, the American people.
[00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:41.137]  Hour 2 is huge.
[00:58:41.137 --> 00:58:41.957]  It's coming up.
[00:58:41.957 --> 00:58:43.839]  Big sales in tomorrow.
[00:58:43.839 --> 00:58:45.860]  Upwards of 50% off.
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:46.861]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:46.861 --> 00:58:47.581]  We need your help.
[00:58:47.581 --> 00:58:48.081]  Great products.
[00:58:48.081 --> 00:58:48.542]  Please check them out.
[00:58:49.434 --> 00:58:53.920]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:59:04.874]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:59:05.014 --> 00:59:10.056]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:59:10.056 --> 00:59:12.637]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:59:12.637 --> 00:59:14.357]  It helps detoxify.
[00:59:14.357 --> 00:59:17.238]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:59:17.238 --> 00:59:22.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:28.282]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:59:28.282 --> 00:59:33.684]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:59:33.684 --> 00:59:34.364]  I'm taking it now.
[00:59:34.824 --> 00:59:36.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:11.044 --> 01:00:13.265]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:13.265 --> 01:00:26.448]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:00:26.448 --> 01:00:29.489]  Witchcraft to hex Trump's populist battle cry.
[01:00:29.489 --> 01:00:32.870]  Trump and Pence and myself and others bring God back in.
[01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:37.351]  The God of justice, the God of life, the God of productivity and creation.
[01:00:38.712 --> 01:00:43.896]  And they say, no, we want Satanism, we want the occult, we want hexes to kill Trump.
[01:00:43.896 --> 01:00:46.078]  This is all over the news, Rolling Stone, you name it.
[01:00:46.078 --> 01:00:48.980]  They had their little events this weekend as a bunch of pathetic losers.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.500]  And guess what?
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.122]  Donald Trump's still alive.
[01:00:52.122 --> 01:00:55.084]  Whether you believe in the metaphysical or not, most of these leftists are into the occult.
[01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.226]  That's why it's called the left-hand path.
[01:00:57.226 --> 01:01:00.789]  They shouldn't be called liberals, they should be called leftists.
[01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:02.990]  That's from the French Revolution and the Jacobins.
[01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.611]  Here's the report.
[01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:12.253]  Real hope and real change for America bellowed from the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.
[01:01:12.253 --> 01:01:15.194]  If you want to see the Trump agenda, it's very simple.
[01:01:15.194 --> 01:01:16.894]  It was all in the speeches.
[01:01:16.894 --> 01:01:21.116]  He went around to these rallies, but those speeches had tremendous amount of content in them, right?
[01:01:21.116 --> 01:01:27.318]  I happen to believe, and I think many others do, he's probably the greatest public speaker in those large arenas since William Jennings Bryan.
[01:01:27.318 --> 01:01:28.298]  This was galvanized.
[01:01:28.298 --> 01:01:30.199]  Remember, we didn't have any money.
[01:01:30.919 --> 01:01:32.820]  Hillary Clinton, these guys, had over $2 billion.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.401]  We had a couple hundred million dollars.
[01:01:34.401 --> 01:01:36.583]  It was those rallies and those speeches.
[01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:45.088]  All he's doing right now is he's laid out an agenda with those speeches, with the promises he made, and our job every day is just to execute on that.
[01:01:45.088 --> 01:01:48.591]  It's to simply get a path to how those get executed.
[01:01:48.591 --> 01:01:50.071]  We gotta mobilize.
[01:01:50.071 --> 01:01:56.736]  We gotta march forward as if it's the most important time in the history of our movement, because it is.
[01:02:00.339 --> 01:02:04.462]  Men and women of this movement, there is no time like the present.
[01:02:04.462 --> 01:02:06.764]  So make your voices heard.
[01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:17.332]  In town halls, with your family and your friends, on the internet and in social media, and in all those places where common sense, conservative messages are most desperately needed.
[01:02:17.332 --> 01:02:19.573]  Because this is our time.
[01:02:19.573 --> 01:02:20.494]  From this day forward,
[01:02:21.414 --> 01:02:26.779]  To make America great again, President Trump and I need every ounce of your energy and enthusiasm.
[01:02:26.779 --> 01:02:31.123]  Your conviction, your courage, your passion.
[01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:34.807]  And we need one more thing, if you're inclined.
[01:02:34.807 --> 01:02:35.588]  We need your prayers.
[01:02:36.966 --> 01:02:45.473]  But the First Amendment gives all of us, it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely.
[01:02:45.473 --> 01:02:53.819]  It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.
[01:02:53.819 --> 01:03:01.045]  And many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it's not your agenda.
[01:03:01.792 --> 01:03:05.173]  And it's not the country's agenda, it's their own agenda.
[01:03:05.173 --> 01:03:10.194]  They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly.
[01:03:10.194 --> 01:03:19.336]  But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn't tell the truth.
[01:03:19.336 --> 01:03:31.298]  And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it's time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker, and to stand up for the American flag.
[01:03:34.847 --> 01:03:38.489]  And by the way, we love our flag.
[01:03:38.489 --> 01:03:41.951]  By the way, you folks that are in here, this place is packed.
[01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:44.833]  There are lines that go back six blocks.
[01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:47.334]  And I tell you that because you won't read about it, okay?
[01:03:47.334 --> 01:03:50.236]  But there are lines that go back six blocks.
[01:03:50.236 --> 01:03:54.018]  There is such love in this country for everything we stand for.
[01:03:54.018 --> 01:03:56.900]  You saw that on election day.
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.261]  And you're going to see it more and more.
[01:03:59.204 --> 01:04:11.736]  Meanwhile, as World Net Daily reports, exorcists, witches, and occultists in a number of magical groups are announcing plans for a ritual designed to bind Donald Trump and all who abet him.
[01:04:11.736 --> 01:04:23.066]  The right, requiring a stub of a candle, a pen, salt matches, a tarot card, a feather, and other odds and ends, calls on spirits to ensure President Trump will fail utterly.
[01:04:23.246 --> 01:04:30.510]  It also includes burning a picture of the Commander-in-Chief, visualizing him blowing apart into dust or ash.
[01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:35.852]  Participants apparently have the option of using a baby carrot instead of an orange candle.
[01:04:35.852 --> 01:04:40.535]  Among the various spirits invoked are the demons of the Infernal Realms.
[01:04:40.535 --> 01:04:47.758]  Those Infernal Demons appear to walk among us in the forms of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and George Soros.
[01:04:47.758 --> 01:04:48.879]  Truly, witchcraft
[01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:56.233]  May be the last avenue to defeat the majority of the will of the American people that the Democrats have left.

[01:04:59.784 --> 01:05:05.711]  A measuring stick for decorum in Congress is approaching, as President Trump is set to deliver his first address to Congress.
[01:05:05.711 --> 01:05:20.668]  In an event classified by its dignity and demeanor, the presidential address will certainly be shadowed by the Democrat trolls, who are planning on bringing guests such as Muslim Americans and Dreamers, in a sad attempt to tug at the heartstrings of America's electorate, and in an attempt to cast Trump as the bad guy.
[01:05:20.868 --> 01:05:31.292]  So instead of concern for their constituents in the states and counties that they represent, they're out casting nets in a search effort to find political pawns they can use against Trump in the psychological battle of optics.
[01:05:31.292 --> 01:05:39.835]  This is also an opportunity for Trump to, again, sound the sirens of nationalism against globalism, and America First policies that will bring jobs back to America.
[01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:44.897]  Infowars will have live coverage of Trump's address to Congress, with the nightly news starting tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:47.658]  Central, then rolling right into live coverage of Trump's address.
[01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:53.344]  Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said the theme of Trump's address will be the renewal of the American spirit.
[01:05:53.344 --> 01:05:56.108]  Of course, the never-Trump Democrats would try to deter that.
[01:05:56.108 --> 01:05:58.671]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:06:00.003 --> 01:06:01.564]  This is Alex Jones.

[01:08:25.698 --> 01:08:35.709]  Joe Pollack's our guest coming up here in just a few minutes with the new book we're selling at InfoWars.com, How Trump Won, the Inside Story of a Revolution.

[01:08:40.274 --> 01:08:43.357]  We'll be talking to him here in just a moment, but first, the start of the fourth hour.
[01:08:43.357 --> 01:08:47.902]  I'm going to premiere this report, The Truth About Donald Trump and Satanism.
[01:08:49.205 --> 01:08:57.647]  All across the country, at state capitals, at city town halls, leftists are openly coming out and chanting, Hail Satan!
[01:08:57.647 --> 01:08:59.547]  Abortion is our sacrament.
[01:08:59.547 --> 01:09:00.947]  We love Lucifer.
[01:09:00.947 --> 01:09:02.327]  And down with Donald Trump.
[01:09:02.327 --> 01:09:03.588]  And it gets worse.
[01:09:03.588 --> 01:09:14.149]  They're now announcing on national television that the public should join hands in ritual magic against Donald Trump to bring him down.
[01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.730]  I don't think you mind, pretty.
[01:09:15.730 --> 01:09:17.210]  And your little dog, too.
[01:09:36.064 --> 01:09:41.506]  Very exciting time to be alive, to say the least.
[01:09:41.506 --> 01:09:46.248]  You see the establishment completely coming after Trump because he's for real.
[01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:49.450]  The book, How Trump Won, by Joel B. Pollack.
[01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:50.850]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:51.971]  Where do you want to start, my friend?
[01:09:51.971 --> 01:09:54.532]  Oh, it's good to be with you.
[01:09:54.532 --> 01:09:55.532]  Wow.
[01:09:55.532 --> 01:10:02.075]  Tell us about why you wrote the book, what's in the book, and currently where you see the presidency going.
[01:10:03.015 --> 01:10:06.123]  Well let me let you and your viewers in on a little secret.
[01:10:06.123 --> 01:10:08.448]  I wrote the book because I expected him to lose.
[01:10:09.429 --> 01:10:17.334]  I thought Trump would win the nomination, but like many others in the media, including in the conservative media, I didn't think he was going to win the election.
[01:10:17.334 --> 01:10:33.904]  And one of the things that bothered me most was that after the election, there was going to be this civil war among conservatives and in the Republican party, and that this was going to damage the effect to move forward with defending the constitution, holding government accountable and so forth.
[01:10:34.384 --> 01:10:53.418]  So I was trying to make head or tail of this election and tell the story of how this election came about in the crazy way that it did, and to try to unify all these different strands together and maybe come up with some basis through which the future opposition, which I assumed would be Republicans, could come together rather than tearing each other apart.
[01:10:53.418 --> 01:10:54.398]  Sure, you know what's funny?
[01:10:54.398 --> 01:10:56.480]  And that's why I wanted to interview you, because I knew that.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.262]  I heard from other folks at Reitbart that that's where your book was going.
[01:11:01.151 --> 01:11:04.184]  I told folks Trump's gonna win according to internal polls.
[01:11:05.151 --> 01:11:19.237]  And we know that they're skewing these other CNN polls and others, but when he wins, it'll just be a battle we won, because the bureaucracy, the Republican establishment, the Democrats, the globalists, all the foreign money is going to pile in against him, so the fight's just beginning.
[01:11:19.237 --> 01:11:33.423]  Trump getting in was just a beachhead, and so your book is perfect now to talk about the battle still going on in the Republican Party, and how we've got to basically have a Trump victory throughout that system first to be able to get this agenda through.
[01:11:35.146 --> 01:11:35.386]  Right.
[01:11:35.386 --> 01:11:39.892]  Well, my co-author, Larry Schweickart, he was convinced Trump would win from the beginning.
[01:11:39.892 --> 01:11:42.336]  And so you talk about those internal polls.
[01:11:42.336 --> 01:11:44.699]  He was one of the people feeding some of those polls.
[01:11:44.699 --> 01:11:47.463]  He had a group of volunteer pollsters that he pulled together.
[01:11:47.463 --> 01:11:49.826]  They call themselves the Renegade Deplorables.
[01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:54.710]  And they were feeding information to the Trump campaign that the professional pollsters didn't have.
[01:11:54.710 --> 01:12:02.195]  So as you read the book, you find out a lot of interesting facts about how Larry knew that this election was going to go the way it did.
[01:12:02.195 --> 01:12:07.339]  But I was on the outside covering the campaign with an outsider's view.
[01:12:07.339 --> 01:12:14.825]  I was with the traveling press corps looking at it, although I was the only conservative member of that press corps, the only person from a conservative publication.
[01:12:15.485 --> 01:12:32.213]  I still was traveling with them seeing what they saw and so I came to it with some degree of skepticism about whether or not he could actually win but then as you read the book you see how I got more and more clues from the people in the audiences at these rallies from talking to the voters themselves about why they were convinced he was going to win.
[01:12:32.213 --> 01:12:37.595]  Sure, we knew that there was a phantom group out there who was intimidated to say they supported Trump.
[01:12:37.595 --> 01:12:42.218]  That's what I saw on the streets of Texas but also California you name it when I traveled but also we saw
[01:12:43.098 --> 01:12:59.829]  If you have access to Bloomberg data, which is huge, or Thomson Reuters, or the Google bots, and other systems, that's why the media was so panicked saying Trump can't win, he's a loser, he's an idiot, was because they knew internally as well that he was really 5, 10, 15 points, depending on the poll ahead.
[01:12:59.829 --> 01:13:04.592]  When he came out of the RNC in Cleveland in July, he was 15 points ahead in real polls.
[01:13:05.052 --> 01:13:09.354]  The big story is, is Republican and Democratic pollsters were all against Trump.
[01:13:09.354 --> 01:13:11.134]  They wouldn't do an honest poll.
[01:13:11.134 --> 01:13:14.776]  And that came out in the WikiLeaks as well, that they were quote, oversampling Democrats.
[01:13:14.776 --> 01:13:18.237]  Not just 7 points like they claim Demographics show, but 15, 20 points.
[01:13:18.237 --> 01:13:24.499]  Hell, they had CNN phone polls that had her winning by 76%, my friend.
[01:13:24.499 --> 01:13:26.200]  They've still got polls out.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.321]  So we hear he's at 55 in Gallup.
[01:13:28.701 --> 01:13:31.567]  Only 10 points up from the election, and they say that's good news?
[01:13:31.567 --> 01:13:35.475]  From my research, it's way, way above that, and that's why they're so panicked.
[01:13:36.789 --> 01:13:36.929]  Right.
[01:13:36.929 --> 01:13:45.915]  Well, one of the other interesting thing was that the media made it so negative to be a Trump supporter that people wouldn't admit to pollsters that they were voting for Trump.
[01:13:45.915 --> 01:13:52.280]  And there was one poll that asked people an additional question, not just who are you voting for, but who are your neighbors voting for?
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.062]  And that gave people cover to say, oh, my neighbors are voting for Trump.
[01:13:56.062 --> 01:14:00.145]  So they could express their own preference for Trump without admitting it themselves.
[01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:02.567]  And those polls were more accurate because that was a more
[01:14:03.428 --> 01:14:05.970]  Safe way for these people to express their preference.
[01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:07.190]  And that's why your book's so important.
[01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:08.051]  That's why we're selling it.
[01:14:08.051 --> 01:14:15.815]  We sell Roger Stone's excellent book, The Making of the President, a real inside view on the guerrilla wars on the ground for this populist victory.
[01:14:15.815 --> 01:14:22.179]  But yours gets into covering in the campaign, but also the inside strategist and other groups out there looking at real polls.
[01:14:22.179 --> 01:14:28.262]  Again, when you're doing a poll, we're not like Democrats that would run out and do a fake poll to say Hillary was 30, 40 points ahead.
[01:14:28.262 --> 01:14:32.185]  We were wanting to know, and the groups I was talking to, where Trump really was.
[01:14:32.825 --> 01:14:36.991]  And so that's why I kept hammering, and the media made fun of this in thousands of publications.
[01:14:36.991 --> 01:14:38.433]  Jones is crazy.
[01:14:38.433 --> 01:14:40.316]  He says Trump has internal polls.
[01:14:40.316 --> 01:14:41.818]  Conway's crazy.
[01:14:41.818 --> 01:14:45.844]  But it's the truth, and the truth is, from our research, Hillary stole five states.
[01:14:47.025 --> 01:14:51.306]  Hillary tried to steal another six that were breaking into the computers, and that's why she was so pissed.
[01:14:51.306 --> 01:14:53.847]  That's why they had the Newsweek printed that she was Madam President.
[01:14:53.847 --> 01:14:59.929]  It's why they had the book printed where Hillary was going to lead, and her daughter, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, worldwide.
[01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:06.311]  It's why they had the TV shows where the Madam President's in charge, and there's a right-wing rebellion against her that has to be arrested.
[01:15:06.311 --> 01:15:11.233]  They were all scripted, all programmed, all ready for this, and it blew up in their face.
[01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:25.837]  Well, you know, one of the most interesting polling failures wasn't even in the general election, it was in the primary in Michigan, where Hillary was up 30% over Bernie Sanders in the primary, and then on election day, he came back and beat her.
[01:15:25.837 --> 01:15:29.378]  I mean, that's an amazing, it was one of the biggest upsets in the history of polling.
[01:15:29.378 --> 01:15:32.938]  But you see, they weren't finding the voters that wanted to come out and vote against Hillary.
[01:15:32.938 --> 01:15:35.619]  They had old pools where they knew they'd get what they wanted.
[01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:37.271]  Right.
[01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:49.280]  And Trump, I think, accessed a lot of those voters, you know, Bernie Sanders voters, people who cared about the issues Trump was talking about, trade and immigration and so forth, but didn't want to be known as Republicans or Trump voters necessarily.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.863]  I think one of the reasons the exit polls on election day were so wrong.
[01:15:53.443 --> 01:15:58.347]  Is that a lot of those Bernie Sanders voters walked out of the polling places, didn't want to talk to anybody.
[01:15:58.347 --> 01:15:59.688]  They didn't want to talk to the pollsters.
[01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.690]  It was their vote, their private affair.
[01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.092]  They didn't want to tell anybody about it.
[01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:10.717]  And, you know, Frank Luntz on the day of the election tweeted out, based on the election polls, Hillary Clinton's going to be the next president of the United States.
[01:16:10.717 --> 01:16:16.202]  And then after it turned out, of course, quite the opposite, he said, this is the biggest disaster in the history of exit polling.
[01:16:16.202 --> 01:16:19.985]  But there were a lot of people who just did not want to share their preferences with professional pollsters.
[01:16:20.868 --> 01:16:21.388]  Absolutely.
[01:16:21.388 --> 01:16:22.228]  Well, look at Hollywood.
[01:16:22.228 --> 01:16:24.089]  The Oscars ratings are way down.
[01:16:24.089 --> 01:16:26.369]  They couldn't even get who Best Pitcher was right.
[01:16:26.369 --> 01:16:32.031]  They spent most of the show bashing Trump, talking about how he goes to the bathroom at 5 a.m.
[01:16:32.031 --> 01:16:35.571]  and, you know, how he's a racist.
[01:16:35.571 --> 01:16:45.734]  You could not be more out of touch than the professional pulsers, MSM, Hollywood, this whole group of mummies who just aren't connected to reality.
[01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:48.955]  Now they're kind of freaking out, going into panic mode.
[01:16:48.955 --> 01:16:50.355]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:16:51.863 --> 01:16:56.545]  Well, it's very interesting because there's a lot of panic right now in the media for two reasons.
[01:16:56.545 --> 01:17:00.646]  One, they tried to stop Trump from winning and they couldn't do it.
[01:17:00.646 --> 01:17:03.587]  So he undermined their power.
[01:17:03.587 --> 01:17:12.730]  And the other thing is they're trying to get the American people to turn against him, but Trump's voters aren't leaving him behind because he's doing so far most of what he promised to do.
[01:17:14.142 --> 01:17:22.548]  He's undermining the media's credibility, and he's still going over... And by the way, when they block him, the media acts like he went back on a promise when he just keeps fighting.
[01:17:22.548 --> 01:17:24.610]  That's right.
[01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:34.137]  And he's laying out an agenda, in addition to taking these executive actions and executive orders, but he's laying out an agenda to achieve what he told people he would achieve.
[01:17:34.137 --> 01:17:38.540]  Now, obviously he promised some very big things, some of which are going to be very hard to deliver.
[01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:46.416]  But as long as he doesn't turn his back on his own voters, and I don't think his own voters feel that he has, he's going to remain in that strong position.
[01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:50.340]  And the media really should know that this works because basically that's what Obama did.
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:58.787]  I mean, Obama kept his coalition together so that even when he was letting down the rest of the country, even when the independents deserted him, the Obama voters were still in his camp.
[01:17:58.787 --> 01:18:00.509]  And that's how he came back and won in 2012.
[01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:04.072]  So we've been in this movie before, but the media thinks it only goes one way.
[01:18:04.926 --> 01:18:08.428]  That's right, and Obama, of course, is keeping his coalition.
[01:18:08.428 --> 01:18:10.869]  He's moved in close to the White House in a bunker.
[01:18:10.869 --> 01:18:15.331]  He's saying he's going to help foment with Soros this whole downfall of Trump.
[01:18:15.331 --> 01:18:20.733]  That only makes it more clear to everybody who's a populist of every race, color, and creed that Trump's the real deal.
[01:18:20.733 --> 01:18:26.516]  In fact, for me, because I'm somebody that's a big skeptic, big anti-establishment, but I study what Trump actually does.
[01:18:27.116 --> 01:18:35.238]  The research, the on-targetness, it's almost unbelievable how good he is from my populist, hardcore libertarian perspective.
[01:18:35.238 --> 01:18:38.179]  I mean, he's just so good, it's unbelievable.
[01:18:38.179 --> 01:18:42.760]  He really approaches things from what's right, what's just, what's common sense.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.421]  I mean, I'm sorry, I have to fawn after Trump.
[01:18:45.731 --> 01:18:46.912]  Well, here's the other thing about it.
[01:18:46.912 --> 01:18:55.623]  You know, he brings his skills as a businessman to the Oval Office, but when people talk about that, they tend to focus on the management skills that you bring from the business world.
[01:18:55.623 --> 01:19:01.269]  The other thing he brings is a feeling for the consumer, and politicians don't have a sense for the consumer.
[01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:02.191]  They never offer us
[01:19:02.791 --> 01:19:09.757]  Oh yeah, if you're in business as a salesman or as a service person, then you better be dialed into what people are saying or you're done.
[01:19:09.757 --> 01:19:10.437]  Exactly.
[01:19:10.437 --> 01:19:17.723]  Pelosi's up there saying she hasn't done anything wrong and thinks Bush is still in office and, you know, Waters thinks that the Russians have invaded Korea.
[01:19:17.723 --> 01:19:19.865]  And you talk about disconnected and la-la land.
[01:19:21.167 --> 01:19:30.155]  Right, so he had a feeling for the consumer and he knew better what was going on in the minds and hearts of the people in that audience than the professionals did and the consultants did.
[01:19:42.947 --> 01:19:48.355]  Million a year from the CIA, literally, that's mainstream news, to run the Washington Post and engage in deceptions and evil.

[01:21:58.496 --> 01:22:01.217]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.

[01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:12.515]  Bill Pollack, editor-at-large, senior editor at Breitbart, how Trump won the inside story of revolution.
[01:24:12.515 --> 01:24:16.017]  We sell the book at infowarstore.com.
[01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:20.358]  And here's the bottom line, you may already know about all of this stuff, but most people don't.
[01:24:20.358 --> 01:24:29.582]  And if you can even get a so-called liberal to read something like this and to see the manipulations, the deception, all the things that were in WikiLeaks, they can really wake up to how they're being conned.
[01:24:29.582 --> 01:24:34.564]  Because a lot of liberals actually believe Trump is this evil, horrible racist who's out to get them.
[01:24:36.257 --> 01:24:41.901]  And once they buy into that mindset, it's hard to get them out of it.
[01:24:41.901 --> 01:24:49.426]  Now, coming up in the next segment, for the next hour and a half, I'm going to take your phone calls, cover clips, cover what happened at the Oscars, and more.
[01:24:49.426 --> 01:24:52.467]  So I'll give out the toll-free number at the start of the next segment.
[01:24:52.467 --> 01:24:53.588]  Going back to Joel Pollack.
[01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:59.052]  Joel, anytime you've got a big story at Breitbart, you want to get out on air, give us an email or a tweet.
[01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:01.193]  We'll get you on for 5, 10, 20 minutes, whatever you want to do.
[01:25:01.193 --> 01:25:02.754]  But congratulations on the book.
[01:25:02.754 --> 01:25:03.675]  I've only read part of it.
[01:25:04.275 --> 01:25:07.760]  I look forward to reading the whole thing, but I'd gotten the inside scoop on what it was on.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:15.070]  I was actually aware of some of the things in it that I'd kept close to the vest, so I'm glad we can talk about some of the things that are now in the book.
[01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:16.733]  But again, congratulations.
[01:25:16.733 --> 01:25:20.057]  Just the last five minutes, what do you want to talk about instead of me asking questions?
[01:25:21.874 --> 01:25:26.157]  Well, let's talk about, as you said, the road ahead from here and where Trump's going to go.
[01:25:26.157 --> 01:25:30.339]  You know, this week he's got his first address to a joint session of Congress.
[01:25:30.339 --> 01:25:34.521]  It's not technically a State of the Union address, but pretty close to it.
[01:25:34.521 --> 01:25:39.865]  And I think that the Democrats are busy trying to figure out how to troll this address.
[01:25:39.865 --> 01:25:41.986]  They're inviting all kinds of people.
[01:25:41.986 --> 01:25:46.869]  Yesterday we saw they're inviting illegal aliens to the address to sit there in the gallery.
[01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:49.450]  And they don't really know what to do.
[01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:54.472]  I mean, one of the more interesting things that he did during this election was he didn't just go for the swing voters.
[01:25:54.472 --> 01:26:01.594]  He reached right into the heart of the Democratic coalition and got those Democratic base voters to join his side.
[01:26:01.594 --> 01:26:03.535]  And Democrats are in a flat out panic about it.
[01:26:04.662 --> 01:26:09.185]  We know more or less what Trump's going to say in Congress because he's been saying it all along.
[01:26:09.185 --> 01:26:10.086]  We know what his agenda is.
[01:26:10.086 --> 01:26:11.327]  He's pretty transparent about it.
[01:26:11.327 --> 01:26:17.551]  But the really interesting thing is to see how the opposition reacts and what kind of resistance, as they call it, they're going to be putting up.
[01:26:18.823 --> 01:26:44.720]  And I love how the whole establishment, the Republican leadership, they're all against him, but the Democrats now call themselves the resistance, because myself, Steve Bannon, Trump, we're all saying and branding it as Drudge has done properly, the resistance to the globalists, the resistance to this whole world government corporate system, it's now out in the open, and so now they're calling themselves the resistance to our president that's just our beachhead to try to take our country back.
[01:26:45.677 --> 01:26:48.239]  Yeah, I think there should be a rule for the Democrats' resistance.
[01:26:48.239 --> 01:26:56.406]  They should have to say it with a French accent, you know, because it is this really crazy notion that we don't live in a democracy.
[01:26:56.406 --> 01:26:58.548]  I mean, they're not calling it the opposition.
[01:26:58.548 --> 01:27:00.509]  You know, the Tea Party was a loyal opposition.
[01:27:00.509 --> 01:27:02.271]  Tea Party was about people
[01:27:02.891 --> 01:27:03.491]  We're good to go.
[01:27:20.919 --> 01:27:24.641]  But that's because fundamentally they are servants of globalism.
[01:27:24.641 --> 01:27:26.342]  That is a foreign takeover.
[01:27:26.342 --> 01:27:27.003]  Like Brexit.
[01:27:27.003 --> 01:27:27.663]  The EU.
[01:27:27.663 --> 01:27:29.404]  England never voted to join the EU.
[01:27:29.404 --> 01:27:31.065]  How did it make 90% of their laws?
[01:27:31.065 --> 01:27:33.427]  They are the ones that are the occupiers.
[01:27:33.427 --> 01:27:35.568]  That's why they're projecting onto us what they are.
[01:27:36.963 --> 01:27:44.029]  Well, what's interesting is that Democrats place more faith in certain global institutions than they do in our own institutions.
[01:27:44.029 --> 01:27:46.171]  And that was a big part of the backlash against Obama.
[01:27:46.171 --> 01:27:52.456]  Remember that when he approved the Iran deal, he went to the UN Security Council before he went to Congress.
[01:27:52.456 --> 01:27:56.580]  Now, not only is that unconstitutional because the Senate is supposed to ratify any treaties,
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:04.445]  But it also tied the hands of Congress, because once he went to the UN Security Council, even if Congress rejected the deal, it was a done deal.
[01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:05.666]  Sure, sure.
[01:28:05.666 --> 01:28:07.807]  And you know, that's just unbelievable.
[01:28:07.807 --> 01:28:20.255]  Do you remember whenever on several deals he would say that he was going to do stuff in Europe with Russia, and then also in Syria, and also in Libya, and he would tell Congress, well, I don't need your authorization, I have NATO's authorization.
[01:28:21.297 --> 01:28:23.619]  Right, well how about the people of the Czech Republic?
[01:28:23.619 --> 01:28:33.206]  I mean, he went there after he got elected, gave a big speech about how he stood with them in their fight against tyranny and so forth, and then he just pulled the rug out from under them on missile defense.
[01:28:33.206 --> 01:28:34.847]  Same thing with the Polish government.
[01:28:34.847 --> 01:28:39.171]  He called the Polish leader in the middle of the night to tell him he had abandoned the treaty we had with them.
[01:28:39.811 --> 01:28:40.871]  On missile defense?
[01:28:40.871 --> 01:28:48.633]  I mean, he did this kind of stuff to America's allies all the time, and placed faith in some of these global institutions, and faith in enemies, frankly.
[01:28:48.633 --> 01:28:51.814]  Not just the Iranian regime, but others.
[01:28:51.814 --> 01:29:03.216]  And that's what people really felt angry about, and you didn't have to care that much about foreign affairs to be pretty upset at the way that Obama was violating the Constitution in the service of some of his other goals.
[01:29:03.476 --> 01:29:21.188]  Sure, and look, it's just like the Iranian director bad-mouthing America for not having open borders last night when they don't have open borders in Iran, and they're all cheering, you know, some guy promoting Iran at the Oscars when none of those Hollywood folks would be allowed to be free in Iran.
[01:29:21.188 --> 01:29:24.230]  It's truly just a bunch of American hating garbage.
[01:29:24.230 --> 01:29:27.812]  We loyally want to make America better and criticize our government when it's wrong.
[01:29:27.812 --> 01:29:29.894]  We don't hate the country or want to pull it down.
[01:29:30.174 --> 01:29:35.559]  Get the book at Infowarsstore.com, How Trump Won, The Inside Story of a Revolution, by Joel B. Pollack.
[01:29:35.559 --> 01:29:37.400]  And then donate one to your library.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.401]  Or, you know, give one to a friend.
[01:29:38.401 --> 01:29:45.027]  This is how we have a cultural revolution against their cultural revolution, is with information war, and the truth's our weapon.
[01:29:45.027 --> 01:29:45.887]  Thank you, Joel.
[01:29:45.887 --> 01:29:49.010]  We'll be back with your phone calls and more.
[01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:50.391]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.391 --> 01:29:52.933]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.933 --> 01:29:55.616]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.884 --> 01:30:05.806]  A measuring stick for decorum in Congress is approaching, as President Trump is set to deliver his first address to Congress.
[01:30:05.806 --> 01:30:20.750]  In an event classified by its dignity and demeanor, the presidential address will certainly be shadowed by the Democrat trolls, who are planning on bringing guests such as Muslim Americans and Dreamers in a sad attempt to tug at the heartstrings of America's electorate, and in an attempt to cast Trump as the bad guy.
[01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:31.399]  So instead of concern for their constituents in the states and counties that they represent, they're out casting nets in a search effort to find political pawns they can use against Trump in the psychological battle of optics.
[01:30:31.399 --> 01:30:39.947]  This is also an opportunity for Trump to, again, sound the sirens of nationalism against globalism, and America First policies that will bring jobs back to America.
[01:30:39.947 --> 01:30:45.011]  InfoWars will have live coverage of Trump's address to Congress, with the nightly news starting tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[01:30:45.011 --> 01:30:47.734]  Central, then rolling right into live coverage of Trump's address.
[01:30:48.194 --> 01:30:53.435]  Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said the theme of Trump's address will be the renewal of the American spirit.
[01:30:53.435 --> 01:30:56.556]  Of course, the never-Trump Democrats would try to deter that.
[01:30:56.556 --> 01:30:59.437]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:30:59.437 --> 01:31:00.257]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:00.257 --> 01:31:02.557]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.

[01:31:08.459 --> 01:31:17.681]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are
[01:31:17.881 --> 01:31:18.762]  We're good to go!

[01:33:00.673 --> 01:33:11.379]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back, when a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[01:33:11.379 --> 01:33:16.202]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed,
[01:33:16.937 --> 01:33:20.938]  He said, it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[01:33:20.938 --> 01:33:21.678]  Sure!
[01:33:21.678 --> 01:33:24.359]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:24.359 --> 01:33:29.200]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.560]  I sat down in the front seat.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.161]  He turned on the radio.
[01:33:34.161 --> 01:33:39.962]  And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid country gold.
[01:33:39.962 --> 01:33:44.403]  Then I noticed a stranger was ghost white pale when he asked me for a light.
[01:33:47.482 --> 01:33:52.784]  It is so pathetic.
[01:33:52.784 --> 01:33:57.986]  I think the word they use is apropos.
[01:33:57.986 --> 01:34:14.592]  That they spend the entire three plus hour long super boring elitist Hollywood event that is the Oscars and at the end of it
[01:34:15.953 --> 01:34:32.057]  They couldn't even get who the actual winner was right and perfectly the name of the film that they get wrong or the name of the film that they give the award to is called La La Land.
[01:34:32.057 --> 01:34:37.218]  Just last week I was saying they are the delusionals and they live in La La Land.
[01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:43.607]  The Nancy Pelosi and the Hollywood crew and all of them live in La La Land.
[01:34:43.607 --> 01:34:46.291]  They live in Alice in Wonderland.
[01:34:46.291 --> 01:34:53.842]  We've used all those terms and then literally, living in La La Land, they give La La Land the award.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:57.961]  What is the definition of apropos?
[01:34:57.961 --> 01:35:00.562]  I tell you, I got the crew on their toes out there, they're so fast.
[01:35:00.562 --> 01:35:04.604]  We ought to go to the definition of apropos before I play this clip and then give the toll-free number out.
[01:35:04.604 --> 01:35:08.006]  I want to talk to first-time callers like we did yesterday, a lot of great callers.
[01:35:08.006 --> 01:35:11.808]  I want to talk about what do you think Trump does to continue on to fight the globalists?
[01:35:11.808 --> 01:35:13.288]  Is he not delivering?
[01:35:13.288 --> 01:35:18.711]  I want to talk to folks that, if you disagree with Trump, think somehow he's sold out.
[01:35:18.711 --> 01:35:19.832]  We're not censoring your calls.
[01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:22.791]  I want to talk to Hillary supporters.
[01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:25.914]  I mean, are you still Hillary supporters after all the things we know?
[01:35:25.914 --> 01:35:29.597]  Apropos, with reference to concerning.
[01:35:29.597 --> 01:35:31.678]  She remarked apropos of the initiative.
[01:35:31.678 --> 01:35:35.121]  It's not going to stop the abuse.
[01:35:35.121 --> 01:35:42.107]  Used to state a speaker's belief that someone's comments or acts are unrelated to any previous discussion or situation.
[01:35:42.107 --> 01:35:44.569]  Very appropriate to a particular situation.
[01:35:44.569 --> 01:35:46.810]  I don't think that's apropos.
[01:35:46.810 --> 01:35:47.451]  That's a different word.
[01:35:50.114 --> 01:35:52.256]  Because again, I go off my memory with words.
[01:35:52.256 --> 01:35:55.177]  Every once in a while I'm wrong about their definition.
[01:35:55.177 --> 01:35:59.000]  But apropos means like someone deserved it.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.123]  Or like somebody hurt somebody so they got instant karma.
[01:36:04.123 --> 01:36:06.064]  Very appropriate to a particular situation.
[01:36:06.064 --> 01:36:08.645]  So I guess that is the right definition.
[01:36:08.645 --> 01:36:10.246]  It's like instant karma.
[01:36:10.246 --> 01:36:13.608]  Basically is what it is.
[01:36:13.608 --> 01:36:14.489]  Instant karma.
[01:36:14.489 --> 01:36:16.410]  Everybody knows that term.
[01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:17.891]  You let your dog crap
[01:36:19.465 --> 01:36:23.288]  In your neighbor's yard.
[01:36:23.288 --> 01:36:26.651]  And then your toilet overflows an hour later.
[01:36:26.651 --> 01:36:28.833]  That's apropos.
[01:36:28.833 --> 01:36:30.294]  So I was correct with the definition.
[01:36:30.294 --> 01:36:32.376]  Thank you guys.
[01:36:32.376 --> 01:36:33.757]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:36:33.757 --> 01:36:33.797]  800-259-9231.
[01:36:42.136 --> 01:37:04.296]  I've looked at what Trump's doing, and he couldn't be doing a better job trying to execute what he's doing, undermining the fake media, exposing them as liars, as enemies of the country, explaining to the American people how we've been captured by globalism, and how we've been sold off to the highest bidder by corrupt elites, and how we have elites in LA and New York that are waging war against the American people.
[01:37:04.296 --> 01:37:07.359]  And then he's not just using that rhetoric, he's actually going after them.
[01:37:08.479 --> 01:37:16.286]  And he's actually creating record small business creation in just 40-something days, and $2 trillion in the stock market, and trying to get big banks to loan to small businesses.
[01:37:16.286 --> 01:37:23.832]  He's doing everything you do to transfer power back to the states, back to Main Street, and back to the people.
[01:37:23.832 --> 01:37:28.996]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-99231.
[01:37:28.996 --> 01:37:31.158]  But I have actually been out to Hollywood.
[01:37:31.158 --> 01:37:33.440]  I was never that obsessed with it like most people, but
[01:37:35.333 --> 01:37:40.875]  You know, when I was 20 years old, I'd think it was dumb if a girlfriend was reading People Magazine.
[01:37:40.875 --> 01:37:41.756]  That's not the real world.
[01:37:41.756 --> 01:37:51.640]  That's there for Madison Avenue to make you feel small and to sell you a bunch of products that you don't need or don't want.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:38:00.184]  That's there to make you think these are really cool people so you'll culturally follow their ideas that are the opposite of what is needed to have a successful life.
[01:38:02.654 --> 01:38:11.422]  But you look at them now, a bunch of disheveled, mentally ill, twisted, unhappy nobodies in most cases.
[01:38:11.422 --> 01:38:14.945]  Most of them are running from Hollywood or they've got a soul.
[01:38:14.945 --> 01:38:17.267]  The whole franchise system is falling apart.
[01:38:17.267 --> 01:38:22.172]  It's being bought up by the authoritarian kingpins of communist China.
[01:38:23.507 --> 01:38:30.030]  But they still arrogantly sit there and lecture everybody and say America's hated now because of Donald Trump.
[01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:42.616]  America is hated many places in the world because the globalists have used our blood, our treasure, our name on the crimes they've committed and in many cases we've been used to execute those crimes and that's wrong and Trump's trying to reverse that.
[01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:45.297]  But of course you blame him for what you've done.
[01:38:47.657 --> 01:38:54.980]  Now, do some people in the world think they can just come here and have everything paid for and, you know, have their babies for free and all the rest of it and so they're mad at Trump?
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:56.400]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:58.841]  And those people are delusional!
[01:38:58.841 --> 01:39:02.943]  So they can join the rest of you in la-la land with the delusionals.
[01:39:02.943 --> 01:39:08.985]  We're the deplorables to those that live in the land of delusion.
[01:39:08.985 --> 01:39:13.587]  Secret ballots, duplicate envelopes, armed guards, and a star-studded finale.
[01:39:13.587 --> 01:39:17.368]  So how did the fine-tuned Oscars machine go so wrong?
[01:39:20.905 --> 01:39:26.752]  Oh, but there's no fine-tuning and there's no ID shown when you vote in California.
[01:39:26.752 --> 01:39:29.876]  But that's okay to let people vote the names of dead people.
[01:39:29.876 --> 01:39:32.278]  But oh my gosh!
[01:39:32.278 --> 01:39:35.042]  This ballot, I guess, got mistaken or stolen.
[01:39:37.139 --> 01:39:53.949]  In an Oscar blunder unlikely, and unlike any before it, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced La La Land as the winner instead of Moonlight of the Best Picture Award after being handed the wrong result card on Sunday night.
[01:39:53.949 --> 01:39:56.110]  And why would Trump attend the Academy Awards?
[01:39:56.110 --> 01:40:01.073]  Why would he attend the White House Correspondents Dinner when he's the guy that would bring rage to it?
[01:40:01.073 --> 01:40:01.734]  And it's all about him.
[01:40:06.391 --> 01:40:07.631]  Epic Oscar mistake.
[01:40:07.631 --> 01:40:12.153]  Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty announced wrong person after bashing Trump.
[01:40:12.153 --> 01:40:15.814]  Self-absorbed celebs award wrong winner at the Oscars.
[01:40:15.814 --> 01:40:17.155]  Infowars.com.
[01:40:17.155 --> 01:40:20.756]  Let's go ahead and play the whole train wreck and I'll narrate it for radio listeners.
[01:40:20.756 --> 01:40:24.197]  Here it is.
[01:40:24.197 --> 01:40:25.558]  Come on.
[01:40:25.558 --> 01:40:26.698]  La La Land.
[01:40:26.698 --> 01:40:28.879]  La La Land.
[01:40:28.879 --> 01:40:30.219]  We're in La La Land.
[01:40:30.219 --> 01:40:31.200]  Oh, yay.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.120]  Guys, guys.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:32.820]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:33.741]  No.
[01:40:33.741 --> 01:40:34.481]  There's a mistake.
[01:40:35.455 --> 01:40:36.896]  Moonlight, you guys won best picture.
[01:40:36.896 --> 01:40:42.119]  This is not a joke.
[01:40:42.119 --> 01:40:43.941]  I'm afraid they read the wrong thing.
[01:40:43.941 --> 01:40:46.963]  This is not a joke.
[01:40:46.963 --> 01:40:57.710]  Moonlight, best picture.
[01:40:57.710 --> 01:40:59.591]  As if any of it matters.
[01:40:59.591 --> 01:41:01.732]  And look, cinema can be incredible.
[01:41:01.732 --> 01:41:04.154]  But it's a representation of the real world that's even more incredible.
[01:41:05.583 --> 01:41:07.066]  It's art.
[01:41:07.066 --> 01:41:13.979]  When it becomes a bunch of arrogant peacocks, owned by communist Chinese, it's a joke.
[01:41:13.979 --> 01:41:14.620]  On them.
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:15.422]  But it's karma.
[01:41:15.422 --> 01:41:16.143]  It's apropos.
[01:41:17.671 --> 01:41:19.812]  I would like to see you get an Oscar anyway.
[01:41:19.812 --> 01:41:21.452]  They sit up there and lie about our president.
[01:41:21.452 --> 01:41:23.753]  They lie about the populist awakening worldwide.
[01:41:23.753 --> 01:41:24.633]  They call it racist.
[01:41:24.633 --> 01:41:25.813]  They call it evil.
[01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:30.714]  When they pitch all their Hollywood race and religion and sex division films.
[01:41:30.714 --> 01:41:38.637]  This empty, corrupt, pedophile-stacked system where they promote Roman Polanski.
[01:41:38.637 --> 01:41:42.918]  Warren, what did you do?
[01:41:42.918 --> 01:41:44.018]  These people are a joke.
[01:41:46.394 --> 01:41:52.066]  I opened the envelope and it said- And now they become the joke.
[01:41:52.066 --> 01:41:53.208]  See, that's Providence.
[01:41:53.208 --> 01:41:54.671]  That's the bad luck they've got.
[01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:56.635]  Everything Trump does has a golden touch.
[01:41:58.413 --> 01:41:59.914]  I wasn't trying to be funny.
[01:41:59.914 --> 01:42:02.917]  Everything they do turns into a pile of steaming garbage.
[01:42:02.917 --> 01:42:04.138]  Thank you very much.
[01:42:04.138 --> 01:42:05.259]  Thank you very much.
[01:42:05.259 --> 01:42:06.180]  Look at these people.
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:08.002]  Look at Whoopi Goldberg.
[01:42:08.002 --> 01:42:16.249]  I mean, just look at these nothing sycophants, mercenaries, to go out and read off a script and then sell their tyranny of lies.
[01:42:16.249 --> 01:42:23.136]  Most of them, Matt Damon, Aflac, all of them, he's not that bad, who pitch all this liberal crap, they don't even believe it.
[01:42:25.322 --> 01:42:26.182]  I know that for a fact.
[01:42:26.182 --> 01:42:27.843]  I've been in Hollywood, I've been around it.
[01:42:27.843 --> 01:42:34.704]  They're either super depressed and want out, or they're totally just insane mental patients that do whatever they're told.
[01:42:34.704 --> 01:42:35.424]  They're actors.
[01:42:35.424 --> 01:42:38.305]  It's fake.
[01:42:38.305 --> 01:42:43.887]  And then if you do speak the truth like Kurt Russell, you get attacked, you get boycotted, you get demonized.
[01:42:43.887 --> 01:42:53.549]  The only person that's big enough and powerful enough is the all-time biggest star, hands down, highest grossing, biggest productions, longest lasting, most successful,
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:58.221]  He was on TV in the 1950s.
[01:42:58.221 --> 01:43:01.662]  His name, of course, is Rowdy Yates.
[01:43:01.662 --> 01:43:03.443]  His name is Clint Eastwood.
[01:43:03.443 --> 01:43:06.924]  And so, of course, he's a patriot.
[01:43:06.924 --> 01:43:08.325]  And he was always the rebel.
[01:43:08.325 --> 01:43:09.705]  America are the rebels.
[01:43:09.705 --> 01:43:13.106]  The American idea of freedom is the latest, coolest thing.
[01:43:13.106 --> 01:43:15.967]  Globalism is just old empires writ large.
[01:43:15.967 --> 01:43:20.089]  Old centralized systems having full control.
[01:43:20.089 --> 01:43:22.570]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:23.350]  To see they're complete?
[01:43:25.089 --> 01:43:29.671]  And total train wreck.
[01:43:29.671 --> 01:43:32.633]  Now I've got a lot more news and a lot of other clips I want to hit.
[01:43:32.633 --> 01:43:38.755]  Bill Paxton, who was a great actor, you know, he died of complications of heart surgery.
[01:43:38.755 --> 01:43:40.356]  Everybody dies.
[01:43:40.356 --> 01:43:41.457]  It's the great unifier.
[01:43:41.457 --> 01:43:50.421]  No matter how many life-extension technologies they try to get, no matter how much computing power they get, the globalists are not going to transcend life and death.
[01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:55.814]  Unless they completely change what humans are and just turn us into machines.
[01:43:55.814 --> 01:43:57.716]  But it won't really be a human anymore, will it?
[01:43:57.716 --> 01:43:59.198]  It won't be the same person.
[01:43:59.198 --> 01:44:02.261]  It won't be the same thing.
[01:44:02.261 --> 01:44:08.749]  In their quest to be God, they give up the humanity that is their closest connection to God.
[01:44:08.749 --> 01:44:11.592]  But if they had discernment, they would already know that.
[01:44:12.714 --> 01:44:19.157]  Okay, we're going to go to your phone calls now with Smith and Joaquin and Mike and Eric and Matthew and others.
[01:44:19.157 --> 01:44:21.798]  As soon as you hear somebody hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[01:44:21.798 --> 01:44:25.580]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.481]  First-time callers today.
[01:44:28.481 --> 01:44:29.281]  First-time callers.
[01:44:29.281 --> 01:44:34.743]  We don't screen your calls other than asking if you'd like to tell us how you're listening, where you're calling from, if you'd like to tell us where you're calling in.
[01:44:34.743 --> 01:44:40.226]  You know, that gives me an idea, but screening means if I disagree with you or not what I'm looking for, I don't have you on the air.
[01:44:41.032 --> 01:44:44.633]  A lot of shows, especially liberal shows, only go for people that agree with them.
[01:44:44.633 --> 01:44:50.235]  I'm old to have people call in and disagree, as long as it's cogent and serious and actually making a point.
[01:44:50.235 --> 01:44:55.857]  But I'm trying to go to each person and move on as quickly as I can because I'm bad about not going to calls and when I do, kind of loitering on it.
[01:44:55.857 --> 01:44:59.199]  So let's go to your phone calls right now.
[01:44:59.199 --> 01:45:02.100]  Who should we talk to first?
[01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:03.560]  Let's go to Dr. Mike in Oregon.
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.081]  You're on the air.
[01:45:07.081 --> 01:45:07.822]  Hello?
[01:45:07.822 --> 01:45:08.762]  Yes, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:45:10.649 --> 01:45:15.791]  Yeah, uh, you know Vladimir Putin slipped that envelope in the back, right?
[01:45:15.791 --> 01:45:16.772]  Yes, oh absolutely!
[01:45:16.772 --> 01:45:21.134]  Well, when the Patriots won the Super Bowl, because Trump likes them, that was Putin.
[01:45:21.134 --> 01:45:23.675]  And absolutely, Vladimir, that's a good meme.
[01:45:23.675 --> 01:45:33.079]  We gotta tweet that out showing, you know, the mess up at the Oscars, and then say, you know, mess up at the Oscars, and under it say, Putin did it.
[01:45:33.079 --> 01:45:35.920]  Intelligence sources confirm.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.981]  Matt, were you just on there when you said that?
[01:45:38.612 --> 01:45:38.872]  No, no.
[01:45:38.872 --> 01:45:43.353]  The rule is, when you want to pop on air with a good point, you pop on yourself, man.
[01:45:43.353 --> 01:45:43.773]  That's right.
[01:45:43.773 --> 01:45:45.874]  Intelligent Sources Confirm.
[01:45:45.874 --> 01:45:46.834]  Unnamed.
[01:45:46.834 --> 01:45:47.894]  That's what we say.
[01:45:47.894 --> 01:45:51.575]  Intelligent Sources Confirm.
[01:45:51.575 --> 01:45:52.495]  Oscar screw-up.
[01:45:52.495 --> 01:45:56.716]  Intelligent Sources Confirm, and then under it real big, Russia did it.
[01:45:56.716 --> 01:45:58.257]  Absolutely, Russia did it.
[01:45:58.257 --> 01:45:59.437]  That is pure genius, Mike.
[01:45:59.437 --> 01:45:59.697]  Go ahead.
[01:46:01.606 --> 01:46:10.315]  Yeah, I frequently shop over at Sportsman's Warehouse and a bunch of other gun stores, and I'm starting to see these little twits out there trying to buy handguns and rifles.
[01:46:10.315 --> 01:46:18.523]  And it's honestly good to see some manhood rising out of them, because the purple socks and other things are just indicating the most manly hood out of them.
[01:46:19.804 --> 01:46:23.445]  Well, let's bring up what you're talking about for listeners that don't know.
[01:46:23.445 --> 01:46:29.887]  Mainstream news reports the last two months since Trump got elected, or three months, that record gun sales with, quote, liberals.
[01:46:29.887 --> 01:46:32.608]  And they say, you can't trust the government.
[01:46:32.608 --> 01:46:33.829]  You know, they may come after us.
[01:46:33.829 --> 01:46:34.769]  We've got to defend ourselves.
[01:46:34.769 --> 01:46:42.911]  Now, it's twisted, but at least they get the Second Amendment and 1776 and understanding that, yes, we the people have a right as a counterbalance.
[01:46:42.911 --> 01:46:47.173]  Even if it's twisted, even if it's misguided, even if they're going after the very thing,
[01:46:48.233 --> 01:46:50.094]  You know, that they claim they've discovered.
[01:46:50.094 --> 01:46:54.117]  It shows they finally understand it's about self-defense.
[01:46:54.117 --> 01:46:56.138]  It's about individual rights.
[01:46:56.138 --> 01:47:00.121]  It's about the individual, not about some great collective state you worship.
[01:47:00.121 --> 01:47:02.062]  They worshipped the state before.
[01:47:02.062 --> 01:47:11.688]  Now that their enemy is in control of the state at some level, they are having the come to Jesus moment where they are now getting guns as a check and balance against an out-of-control state.
[01:47:11.688 --> 01:47:13.849]  The circle is now complete.
[01:47:13.849 --> 01:47:14.730]  Yes, it's a beautiful thing.
[01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:15.030]  Go ahead.
[01:47:16.863 --> 01:47:25.088]  Yeah, it's becoming the new trendy thing amongst liberals quietly and the media doesn't really want to report on it and it's quite funny.
[01:47:25.088 --> 01:47:30.852]  This should be interesting in time because I don't know what the media is going to do when Trump's actually liked by all these people.
[01:47:31.781 --> 01:47:38.747]  Because I just feel like the tide's going to turn here real soon and that these people are going to be facing the monster that they created.
[01:47:38.747 --> 01:47:49.637]  And it's going to be big trouble for them here real soon when it becomes trendy to like Trump, to like guns, to like freedom, to, you know, just like security in just a honest, prosperous country.
[01:47:50.643 --> 01:47:51.263]  Great points.
[01:47:51.263 --> 01:47:51.823]  Great caller.
[01:47:51.823 --> 01:47:52.403]  God bless you.
[01:47:52.403 --> 01:47:53.744]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:47:53.744 --> 01:47:54.664]  I love callers.
[01:47:54.664 --> 01:47:55.924]  They bring up points I wouldn't have gotten to.
[01:47:55.924 --> 01:47:58.085]  Let's put that back on screen for radio listeners.
[01:47:58.085 --> 01:47:59.225]  I want to read it to people.
[01:47:59.225 --> 01:48:02.166]  TV viewers obviously see the crew pull up articles as we speak.
[01:48:02.166 --> 01:48:02.846]  Why U.S.
[01:48:02.846 --> 01:48:04.326]  liberals are now buying guns too.
[01:48:04.326 --> 01:48:05.666]  BBC, will you print me that please?
[01:48:05.666 --> 01:48:06.307]  Thank you.
[01:48:06.307 --> 01:48:07.507]  I never really addressed this properly.
[01:48:07.507 --> 01:48:08.287]  I've talked about it some.
[01:48:08.287 --> 01:48:11.248]  We should do a whole report of how they're finally getting it.
[01:48:11.248 --> 01:48:12.448]  They're finally understanding.
[01:48:14.738 --> 01:48:16.979]  Now there she is, I think, shooting a what, a Ruger .22?
[01:48:16.979 --> 01:48:21.021]  If I'm looking at that, but whatever, that's a good, that's a good little beginner gun.
[01:48:21.021 --> 01:48:22.621]  It's a fun little planking gun.
[01:48:22.621 --> 01:48:31.165]  The point is, is that they finally understand why there's a Second Amendment, even though they're misguided.
[01:48:31.165 --> 01:48:35.467]  And the media actually has been reporting on the fact that this is going on.
[01:48:35.467 --> 01:48:37.128]  So, welcome to the club, folks.
[01:48:38.410 --> 01:48:38.750]  Welcome!
[01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:46.152]  You finally are starting to get so whacked out that the circle has gone all the way around and you're actually coming back towards reality.
[01:48:46.152 --> 01:48:58.654]  Now you're going to go out and shoot guns, meet like-minded people, you're going to be around conservatives, patriots, libertarians, just pro-human folks, pro-human empowerment movement, and I guarantee you the next step is you're going to convert to reality.
[01:48:58.654 --> 01:49:00.655]  Just like I've taken out countless
[01:49:02.324 --> 01:49:03.325]  Libtards.
[01:49:03.325 --> 01:49:08.708]  I call them libtards because they are liberal, they're uninformed, they're very retarded, historically and culturally.
[01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:12.630]  And within minutes of shooting bullseye, they're saying, why couldn't I do this?
[01:49:12.630 --> 01:49:13.851]  I'm not a bad person.
[01:49:13.851 --> 01:49:14.972]  It's true!
[01:49:14.972 --> 01:49:16.773]  Only criminals have guns if I don't have them.
[01:49:16.773 --> 01:49:18.974]  This is incredible!
[01:49:18.974 --> 01:49:19.675]  It's instant.
[01:49:19.675 --> 01:49:20.895]  It's victorious.
[01:49:20.895 --> 01:49:23.957]  It's always the same, if you can get them out.
[01:49:23.957 --> 01:49:29.401]  Then they learn proper safety, proper stowage, and then they begin to believe that they could be free as well!
[01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:38.265]  Then they understand, yeah, Piers Morgan has a bodyguard and armed defense at his house, but he doesn't want me to have a gun.
[01:49:38.265 --> 01:49:39.185]  Michael Moore does too.
[01:49:39.185 --> 01:49:39.865]  That's not right.
[01:49:39.865 --> 01:49:42.867]  That doesn't make sense.
[01:49:42.867 --> 01:49:44.168]  Eric in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:49:44.168 --> 01:49:47.709]  Go ahead.
[01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:50.571]  First time caller, long time listener.
[01:49:50.571 --> 01:49:53.192]  Just wanted to touch base with you on a subject here.
[01:49:53.192 --> 01:49:57.734]  A lot of people haven't really heard much on.
[01:49:57.734 --> 01:49:59.735]  We heard Spicer the other day talking about
[01:50:00.254 --> 01:50:00.694]  Sure, sure.
[01:50:29.813 --> 01:50:39.820]  Then, you know, he could appease the leftists and the, you know, the trendies and everybody that are all pro-marijuana and get them on board with states' rights.
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:40.380]  No, I hear you.
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:41.281]  Let me make a point on this.
[01:50:41.281 --> 01:50:42.221]  You're making a great point, Eric.
[01:50:42.221 --> 01:50:45.043]  Thank you.
[01:50:45.043 --> 01:50:46.805]  Trump was wrong in my view about torture.
[01:50:46.805 --> 01:50:48.406]  He now talked to Sessions.
[01:50:48.406 --> 01:50:54.350]  He now talked to Mattis and agrees that the policy shouldn't be torture.
[01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.550]  Okay.
[01:50:55.899 --> 01:51:02.360]  He's been a little bit wrong on surveillance, now as he learns more about it and how it was used against him illegally, he's starting to shift towards a better position.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:08.461]  But he's Americana, he means well, he goes off his own common sense, and that's why he doesn't flip-flop.
[01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:13.782]  When he learns he's been too extreme or wrong, he moves towards common sense.
[01:51:13.782 --> 01:51:19.303]  Now on the subject of alcohol, he had a brother that drunk himself to death, that's admitted.
[01:51:19.303 --> 01:51:22.424]  And so Trump is really anti-alcohol.
[01:51:22.424 --> 01:51:24.364]  Now he's got kids that have a wine company.
[01:51:25.219 --> 01:51:26.920]  I don't think a few glasses of wine is bad for you.
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.182]  It's been proven to be good for you.
[01:51:28.182 --> 01:51:31.925]  So he's, you know, he's moderate on it, but extreme in his own personal views.
[01:51:31.925 --> 01:51:33.326]  But he believes you have a right.
[01:51:33.326 --> 01:51:37.129]  He's seen what marijuana does to some people that are under motivated.
[01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:38.711]  It turns them into people in their mom's basements.
[01:51:38.711 --> 01:51:40.192]  It's very destructive for some people.
[01:51:40.192 --> 01:51:42.214]  Has a lot of great medical uses.
[01:51:42.214 --> 01:51:43.735]  Helps a lot of people that are high strung.
[01:51:43.735 --> 01:51:47.258]  Studies show it's much better than Prozac and, you know, other stuff.
[01:51:47.258 --> 01:51:48.199]  But it can be destructive.
[01:51:49.428 --> 01:51:55.790]  You know, if you're an alpha male, you know, athlete like Joe Rogan, who's super high-strung, some marijuana, you know, is good for you.
[01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:58.311]  But if you're somebody that's already not motivated, you're going to end up being a zombie.
[01:51:58.311 --> 01:51:59.791]  I mean, it's true.
[01:51:59.791 --> 01:52:04.773]  I'm for decriminalization so our prisons aren't filled with nonviolent people.
[01:52:04.773 --> 01:52:06.373]  I do believe it should be a state's issue.
[01:52:06.373 --> 01:52:10.735]  Obama said it would be, but double-crossed that and increased marijuana enforcement federally.
[01:52:12.173 --> 01:52:21.218]  I agree that marijuana should be decriminalized and should be available for recreational use in adults because it's a free country, it's a free world.
[01:52:21.218 --> 01:52:24.360]  And if you can go drink a bottle of Jack Daniels, it's not good for you.
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:26.941]  We shouldn't have to pay for it when your, you know, your liver fails.
[01:52:26.941 --> 01:52:29.182]  But that's your right to do that.
[01:52:29.182 --> 01:52:36.166]  And if you want to blast your brain and turn yourself into a zombie with the super high-powered marijuana they got, that's your right.
[01:52:36.166 --> 01:52:37.987]  I want our police going after
[01:52:39.099 --> 01:52:49.684]  Rapists, and arsonists, and criminals, and white collar fraudsters, and people that write hot checks over and over again, and people that run scams, and illegal aliens that have committed crimes.
[01:52:49.684 --> 01:52:54.647]  I don't want them running around looking for marijuana in your car.
[01:52:54.647 --> 01:53:01.190]  Now, that said, I know that a lot of drug use, take prescription stuff, is a disease.
[01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:02.171]  It is an addiction.
[01:53:02.171 --> 01:53:04.252]  You can have hillbilly heroin a doctor puts you on.
[01:53:04.252 --> 01:53:07.173]  That's the same thing as heroin that's shipped in from Afghanistan.
[01:53:07.173 --> 01:53:07.914]  The two are the same.
[01:53:11.161 --> 01:53:16.743]  And I think if you catch people with it, illegally, it should be taken away, but I don't think there should be big penalties, because they're addicted.
[01:53:16.743 --> 01:53:18.744]  Now, if you're selling it to kids, that's different.
[01:53:18.744 --> 01:53:24.466]  I think there should be serious felony laws about drugs and kids, because that's contributing to the delinquency of minors.
[01:53:24.466 --> 01:53:29.028]  So the drug laws are really pretty common sense, if you want to have them that way, but they're not.
[01:53:29.028 --> 01:53:36.912]  You sell drugs, legal or illegal, to kids, it's a very, very stiff penalty, because you're contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and you're getting it inside a family.
[01:53:36.912 --> 01:53:39.753]  And it should be back to the states.
[01:53:40.899 --> 01:53:44.900]  But I agree it'd be a big victory for Trump if he moderated Sessions some.
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:51.762]  Sessions is great on so many points, but he's one of those older guys from Alabama that thinks catch him with a marijuana cigarette, throw him under the jail.
[01:53:51.762 --> 01:53:53.302]  Come on.
[01:53:53.302 --> 01:53:55.323]  Come on.
[01:53:55.323 --> 01:53:56.363]  Can't be moderate about it.
[01:53:56.363 --> 01:53:58.724]  Half the population smokes marijuana in this country.
[01:53:58.724 --> 01:54:00.904]  We've chosen we like it.
[01:54:00.904 --> 01:54:01.784]  That's what's going on.
[01:54:01.784 --> 01:54:03.445]  I personally don't like marijuana.
[01:54:03.445 --> 01:54:04.285]  Very rarely smoke it.
[01:54:05.213 --> 01:54:06.094]  Because it's Russian Roulette.
[01:54:06.094 --> 01:54:08.155]  Sometimes it feels great and I can think on it.
[01:54:08.155 --> 01:54:13.399]  Other times, the only time I'm fearful, and I don't ever have fear or anxiety, really.
[01:54:13.399 --> 01:54:16.202]  I smoke marijuana, I start worrying about my kids, everybody around me.
[01:54:16.202 --> 01:54:18.644]  I start being paranoid.
[01:54:18.644 --> 01:54:22.807]  I don't like it.
[01:54:22.807 --> 01:54:24.208]  Other times I smoke it, I want to go to sleep.
[01:54:24.208 --> 01:54:26.970]  So that's why I get talked into it every few years.
[01:54:26.970 --> 01:54:30.013]  It's just, you know, it's like one time it's okay, other times it's horrible.
[01:54:30.013 --> 01:54:31.734]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:54:31.734 --> 01:54:32.575]  Some people it helps.
[01:54:33.706 --> 01:54:37.848]  So that's where I stand on marijuana.
[01:54:37.848 --> 01:54:43.430]  Other drugs need to be decriminalized because making them illegal makes them black market and they're full of poison.
[01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:45.111]  They're full of garbage.
[01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:46.092]  They're full of additives.
[01:54:46.092 --> 01:54:47.412]  It's super dangerous.
[01:54:47.412 --> 01:54:49.193]  And young people shouldn't think it's cool.
[01:54:49.193 --> 01:54:57.757]  By the way, if you decriminalize, every European study shows drug use goes down because there's not a black market in it and it's not seen as cool underground anymore.
[01:54:57.757 --> 01:55:00.278]  And then the young people can't be involved in it because there's no money.
[01:55:01.889 --> 01:55:03.389]  And the gangs can't either.
[01:55:03.389 --> 01:55:04.530]  So I've done my research.
[01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:05.850]  That's where I stand.
[01:55:05.850 --> 01:55:08.851]  And I think that's really what Trump should do about it.
[01:55:08.851 --> 01:55:09.571]  I totally agree with you.
[01:55:09.571 --> 01:55:12.692]  It would be a big victory for Trump to do that, something Obama wouldn't do.
[01:55:12.692 --> 01:55:25.415]  And I think you should leave it to the states and say, as long as you're not giving drugs to kids and as long as you're not selling it and distributing, as long as it's for your own use, then it should not be a serious crime.
[01:55:28.965 --> 01:55:33.236]  And then make it where you can get it legally, and if they catch you with it illegally, then it's like a ticket.
[01:55:33.236 --> 01:55:34.459]  That's decriminalization.
[01:55:34.459 --> 01:55:38.088]  I do not think it should be Wild Wild West, you know, marijuana everywhere.
[01:55:39.755 --> 01:55:55.181]  Believe me, I mean, I was in, a while back, two years ago I was in Denver, they just legalized it, and I said, let me go to one of these things, and I went in the dispensary, and I went in there, and I bought some marijuana, and I smoked it, and I mean, I laid down at five o'clock and woke up at midnight.
[01:55:55.181 --> 01:56:00.122]  I mean, I was just like, good God, this is like drinking a half bottle of whiskey.
[01:56:00.122 --> 01:56:03.584]  So it's high-powered.
[01:56:03.584 --> 01:56:04.044]  High-powered.
[01:56:05.171 --> 01:56:10.433]  And I really did go, like, cops take drugs, you know, and test so they know what it feels like so they can recognize it.
[01:56:10.433 --> 01:56:14.655]  I literally have taken marijuana to know what it's like.
[01:56:14.655 --> 01:56:21.097]  And compared to stuff I smoked a few times in high school, it's 15, 20 times stronger.
[01:56:21.097 --> 01:56:21.978]  Okay, I digress.
[01:56:21.978 --> 01:56:23.498]  See, caller brings up a great point.
[01:56:23.498 --> 01:56:24.478]  I do a 10-minute diatribe.
[01:56:24.478 --> 01:56:25.419]  I apologize.
[01:56:25.419 --> 01:56:28.820]  Let's go back to Joaquin and others here in just a moment.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.461]  Continue with calls right through the next hour.
[01:56:31.445 --> 01:56:33.746]  You can also send Twitter questions at RealAlexJones.
[01:56:33.746 --> 01:56:37.408]  I'll cover some of those at the bottom of the next hour, I promise, so remind me, crew.
[01:56:37.408 --> 01:56:46.513]  Briefly, we are selling the new book that I mentioned here, How Trump Won, The Inside Story of a Revolution, by Joel B. Pollack.
[01:56:46.513 --> 01:56:53.917]  Documents a lot of the internal polling I told you about, that I was made privy to by the campaign and others.
[01:56:53.917 --> 01:56:58.560]  Also, we are ending a special tomorrow, at the end of the month,
[01:57:00.691 --> 01:57:12.074]  February only has 28 days, folks, where you can get 33% off so many of the products, 25% off on some of the other products, you name it.
[01:57:12.074 --> 01:57:19.976]  So the Defense of Liberty special ends here tomorrow and I just want to thank everybody
[01:57:21.462 --> 01:57:22.362]  For your support.
[01:57:22.362 --> 01:57:25.023]  You know, I had the printout here.
[01:57:25.023 --> 01:57:25.664]  Here it is.
[01:57:25.664 --> 01:57:32.226]  The Defense of Liberty 13-hour broadcast extended, sailed for a limited time at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:57:32.226 --> 01:57:33.827]  Defend Infowars Extended Special.
[01:57:33.827 --> 01:57:37.248]  You know, we're getting censored, blocked off being able to advertise on Google.
[01:57:37.248 --> 01:57:43.411]  They want to make us rely only on the audience, not to go out, sell products outside the audience, and then fund the show to reach everybody.
[01:57:43.411 --> 01:57:44.491]  See how we do that?
[01:57:44.491 --> 01:57:45.672]  Silver Bullet, Colonel Silver, 33% off.

[01:58:02.094 --> 01:58:06.096]  $19.95, those are almost sold out, on parchment paper.

[01:58:30.930 --> 01:58:32.471]  We don't believe in them, we rely on them.
[01:58:49.602 --> 01:58:53.723]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[01:58:53.723 --> 01:58:56.544]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:58:56.544 --> 01:58:58.084]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[01:58:58.084 --> 01:59:02.266]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:59:02.266 --> 01:59:06.067]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[01:59:06.067 --> 01:59:07.667]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:59:07.667 --> 01:59:09.308]  It's gonna be coming after your gun.
[01:59:09.308 --> 01:59:09.808]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:09.808 --> 01:59:11.848]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:59:11.848 --> 01:59:12.469]  At all.
[01:59:12.469 --> 01:59:13.529]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:59:13.529 --> 01:59:15.930]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:59:15.930 --> 01:59:16.630]  They lost.
[01:59:17.090 --> 01:59:17.890]  We won.
[01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:20.112]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[01:59:20.112 --> 01:59:21.413]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:59:21.413 --> 01:59:23.334]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[01:59:23.334 --> 01:59:29.417]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:59:29.417 --> 01:59:31.759]  And beef was for supper.
[01:59:31.759 --> 01:59:34.360]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:36.201]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:59:36.201 --> 01:59:37.722]  DVDs now available.

[01:59:42.405 --> 01:59:45.727]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:59:45.727 --> 01:59:48.089]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[01:59:48.089 --> 01:59:51.951]  Let's fix it.
[01:59:51.951 --> 01:59:55.313]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:55.313 --> 02:00:04.939]  I've got a tiger by the tail this week!
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:14.322]  He never gives up.
[02:00:14.322 --> 02:00:16.364]  He's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.364 --> 02:00:19.507]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[02:00:19.507 --> 02:00:20.668]  Worldwide.
[02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:27.772]  Make no mistake.
[02:00:27.772 --> 02:00:29.214]  Humanity is awakening.
[02:00:46.055 --> 02:00:53.338]  The globalists are in full panic, and they're only showing themselves even more in their attempts to intimidate humanity.
[02:00:53.338 --> 02:01:09.306]  If we simply say no, if we simply stand up and speak out for their bullying, this will all blow up in their face ten times what you've already seen with the globalists and Obama going to the UK, telling them they couldn't vote to get out of the EU, the EU threatening financial warfare on the UK.
[02:01:09.306 --> 02:01:10.247]  That blew up bigger.
[02:01:10.247 --> 02:01:12.868]  Now Brexit numbers are even more positive in polls.
[02:01:14.704 --> 02:01:20.409]  Now they're trying to intimidate our economy, telling us to, you know, go against Trump or everything's going to implode.
[02:01:20.409 --> 02:01:23.311]  Go ahead!
[02:01:23.311 --> 02:01:24.192]  Implode the economy.
[02:01:24.192 --> 02:01:28.215]  It's only going to give Trump more power to try to get our agenda through.
[02:01:28.215 --> 02:01:31.738]  Now I got a bunch of news I want to hit interspersed the next hour, but I promise to take your calls.
[02:01:31.738 --> 02:01:33.879]  They're bringing up great points.
[02:01:33.879 --> 02:01:36.982]  It's your chance to call in after you hear somebody hang up if you disagree.
[02:01:36.982 --> 02:01:39.244]  Remember, a lot of folks calling in that were for Hillary.
[02:01:40.011 --> 02:01:43.353]  During the Trump campaign, how are you feeling now after Trump really delivered?
[02:01:43.353 --> 02:01:45.574]  Because they would always say, oh, he's a rich guy.
[02:01:45.574 --> 02:01:47.575]  He won't really try to get jobs back.
[02:01:47.575 --> 02:01:50.417]  He won't really try to get small business loans.
[02:01:50.417 --> 02:01:53.179]  He won't really do his promises.
[02:01:53.179 --> 02:01:55.140]  He's already gotten a lot of what he said he would do through.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:02:02.804]  And he's battling the rest of it steadfastly and calling out the enemy media, calling out the fake stream media as the enemy.
[02:02:02.804 --> 02:02:03.745]  Could you ever ask for that?
[02:02:05.370 --> 02:02:08.512]  I mean, you cannot say that Trump is the establishment.
[02:02:08.512 --> 02:02:10.894]  He is the antithesis of that.
[02:02:10.894 --> 02:02:15.737]  But maybe you want to call in and tell me why I'm wrong.
[02:02:15.737 --> 02:02:20.860]  I know a lot of so-called libertarians and other people that just, they get intimidated by all the anti-Trump stuff.
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:26.964]  They want to be on the fence and kind of bash Trump and also support Trump or sit there and do all this.
[02:02:26.964 --> 02:02:31.087]  And almost every time their criticism of Trump isn't real.
[02:02:31.087 --> 02:02:31.527]  It isn't real.
[02:02:33.982 --> 02:02:43.746]  Oh look, he's got three Goldman Sachs people in there, yeah, who've all got a background to fighting the New World Order.
[02:02:43.746 --> 02:02:47.248]  But he has had some of his appointees openly criticize him and turn against him.
[02:02:47.248 --> 02:02:49.209]  Which shows how he's completely surrounded.
[02:02:49.209 --> 02:02:54.971]  But he's got the truth on his side, and if we the people get behind him, nothing on earth can stop us with God's blessing.
[02:02:54.971 --> 02:02:57.172]  Joaquin in Arizona, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:02:58.542 --> 02:02:59.462]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[02:02:59.462 --> 02:03:07.264]  I appreciate your time today and I'd like to thank you for your dedication and your sacrifice that you've given to this nation through your show.
[02:03:07.264 --> 02:03:13.045]  I've been following you since you pulled the covers on Bohemian Grove and kind of been addicted to it ever since.
[02:03:13.045 --> 02:03:19.666]  At first, I have to tell you, I was a little skeptical, but everything that you've said since way back then has come to pass.
[02:03:19.666 --> 02:03:27.328]  So that's how I know that's the litmus test, that you're definitely for real, and this is an exciting time to be alive.
[02:03:27.908 --> 02:03:33.031]  You've covered so many topics that it's hard to stay focused, so I've written down some notes.
[02:03:33.031 --> 02:03:42.456]  A brief history, I served with the 82nd Airborne Division and got in some trouble later on in life and I subsequently became a minister of the gospel.
[02:03:42.456 --> 02:03:52.101]  So one of the questions that you had asked earlier in the show was, what can Trump do to continue his agenda and to make it with his head above water with everybody against him?
[02:03:52.681 --> 02:03:58.490]  I think what's important for the listeners to understand is that everybody isn't against him.
[02:03:58.490 --> 02:04:01.614]  There is a huge majority of the populace that... You know what?
[02:04:01.614 --> 02:04:02.716]  I'm not going to cut you off.
[02:04:02.716 --> 02:04:08.244]  Start over when we come back in the next segment because I tend to harp on the fact that at the top, the corrupt elites...
[02:04:08.925 --> 02:04:14.950]  And the power structure is against him, but when you get in the military, the intelligence agencies, the general public, most people support him.
[02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:17.452]  They're trying to make us think he's isolated.
[02:04:17.452 --> 02:04:23.957]  But I do want to point out, he is surrounded at his level by a bunch of scum, and it is very lion-like.
[02:04:23.957 --> 02:04:29.201]  It only makes me admire Trump more, because few people have ever been in a position like this.
[02:04:29.201 --> 02:04:33.284]  I mean, I'm in the position of being surrounded at this level.
[02:04:34.185 --> 02:04:38.186]  But Trump's at even another level surrounded and only makes you want to defend him.
[02:04:38.186 --> 02:04:43.148]  So I'll come back to you, Joaquin, to flesh all this out, to talk about this on the other side.
[02:04:43.148 --> 02:04:48.390]  And then Smith and Rob and James and Matthew and many others.
[02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:49.250]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:49.250 --> 02:04:54.932]  Infowars.com, presentplanet.com are the URLs they hate and they're trying to block and ban.
[02:04:54.932 --> 02:04:56.353]  So you know what to do.
[02:04:56.353 --> 02:04:56.793]  We'll be back.
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:05.448]  The United States foreign policy and engagement with Syria has been a disaster, and it may start and end with John McCain.
[02:05:05.448 --> 02:05:09.433]  Four years, McCain has been a buffer between the Middle East and the United States.
[02:05:09.433 --> 02:05:11.495]  McCain took a rare trip to Syria in 2013.
[02:05:11.495 --> 02:05:15.200]  He met with so-called moderate rebels Obama was bankrolling and arming.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:18.324]  It turned out that these moderate rebels were the ones destabilizing the region.
[02:05:18.624 --> 02:05:20.206]  And could even be tied to ISIS.
[02:05:20.206 --> 02:05:27.013]  But of course, this would fit the foreign policy of the Obama administration and the Clinton State Department, which wanted Bashar Assad removed from power.
[02:05:27.013 --> 02:05:30.237]  Last week, McCain took another rare and secret trip to Syria.
[02:05:30.237 --> 02:05:33.160]  A spokesperson for McCain said he was there to visit with U.S.
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:35.903]  ground forces to discuss plans to defeat ISIL.
[02:05:35.903 --> 02:05:38.265]  ISIL, not ISIS, they were sure to clarify.
[02:05:38.265 --> 02:05:39.567]  Now, how coincidental,
[02:05:39.907 --> 02:05:44.371]  Upon McCain's return to the U.S., news stories everywhere are talking about more U.S.
[02:05:44.371 --> 02:05:46.153]  ground forces being sent to Syria.
[02:05:46.153 --> 02:05:50.117]  John McCain is a detriment to our nation, the Middle East, and peace on this planet.
[02:05:50.117 --> 02:05:56.483]  He needs to be removed from any unelected duties, and it is upon the people in the great state of Arizona to rid us of this warmonger.
[02:05:56.483 --> 02:05:58.525]  For InfoWars.com, I'm Owen Schroer.
[02:05:59.537 --> 02:06:01.378]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:06:01.378 --> 02:06:07.981]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:07.981 --> 02:06:11.142]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:11.142 --> 02:06:20.926]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:06:20.926 --> 02:06:21.767]  Caveman.
[02:06:21.767 --> 02:06:26.829]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:26.829 --> 02:06:28.950]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:29.250 --> 02:06:32.391]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:32.391 --> 02:06:37.534]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:37.534 --> 02:06:45.677]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:45.677 --> 02:06:53.461]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:58.283]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself at InforgedLife.com today.
[02:06:59.048 --> 02:07:00.909]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:07:00.909 --> 02:07:02.950]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:05.751]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:07:05.751 --> 02:07:11.914]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:07:11.914 --> 02:07:21.099]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:07:21.099 --> 02:07:25.961]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:07:26.181 --> 02:07:28.642]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:07:28.642 --> 02:07:36.665]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:07:36.665 --> 02:07:37.626]  The general public doesn't.
[02:07:38.855 --> 02:07:42.216]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:07:42.216 --> 02:07:46.357]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:07:46.357 --> 02:07:53.059]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:07:53.059 --> 02:07:57.160]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:07:59.784 --> 02:08:01.725]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:08:01.725 --> 02:08:03.687]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:08:03.687 --> 02:08:06.609]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:08:06.609 --> 02:08:07.449]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:07.449 --> 02:08:08.530]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:08:08.530 --> 02:08:11.632]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:08:11.632 --> 02:08:14.934]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:08:14.934 --> 02:08:16.875]  Alex Jones, the nut job radio guy.
[02:08:16.875 --> 02:08:18.496]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.496 --> 02:08:23.940]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says.
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:24.941]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:08:24.941 --> 02:08:26.502]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:08:26.502 --> 02:08:27.022]  This isn't a game!
[02:08:27.082 --> 02:08:28.385]  Hate speech.
[02:08:28.385 --> 02:08:30.428]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[02:08:30.428 --> 02:08:34.716]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[02:08:38.892 --> 02:08:40.873]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:08:40.873 --> 02:08:42.615]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[02:08:42.615 --> 02:08:45.917]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[02:08:45.917 --> 02:08:48.558]  It's an internet talk show called Info Wars.
[02:08:48.558 --> 02:08:50.640]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:51.780]  Are you insane?
[02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:54.002]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[02:08:54.002 --> 02:08:56.824]  You're making some very serious allegations against the U.S.
[02:08:56.824 --> 02:09:01.467]  government, saying that they stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against U.S.
[02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:01.787]  citizens.
[02:09:01.787 --> 02:09:02.647]  Let's declassify.
[02:09:02.647 --> 02:09:04.389]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[02:09:04.389 --> 02:09:06.850]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:09:06.850 --> 02:09:08.011]  That man's a threat to this country.
[02:09:08.291 --> 02:09:09.673]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:09:09.673 --> 02:09:11.054]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[02:09:11.054 --> 02:09:12.916]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:09:12.916 --> 02:09:14.758]  He's considered legitimate among the crazy.
[02:09:14.758 --> 02:09:20.965]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[02:09:20.965 --> 02:09:22.386]  I'd love to see that.
[02:09:22.386 --> 02:09:24.448]  In uniform.
[02:09:24.448 --> 02:09:27.812]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[02:09:27.812 --> 02:09:29.694]  I like that guy.
[02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:48.495]  We have gangsters running this country.
[02:09:48.495 --> 02:09:49.197]  Criminals!
[02:09:49.197 --> 02:09:49.758]  Gangsters!
[02:09:49.758 --> 02:09:52.643]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[02:09:55.414 --> 02:09:58.575]  We have a fog that has descended on our entire nation.
[02:09:58.575 --> 02:10:00.776]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[02:10:00.776 --> 02:10:03.096]  But Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[02:10:03.096 --> 02:10:08.798]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[02:10:08.798 --> 02:10:09.938]  Is it real or is it good?
[02:10:09.938 --> 02:10:13.619]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:10:13.619 --> 02:10:14.920]  To Matt, it's over for you.
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:17.381]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:10:17.381 --> 02:10:18.641]  You're out of there.
[02:10:18.641 --> 02:10:20.181]  You want it, baby?
[02:10:20.181 --> 02:10:21.782]  You're about to get it.
[02:10:28.467 --> 02:10:36.870]  We did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant, and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:41.812]  We met them at Concord Bridge, and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[02:10:41.812 --> 02:10:53.816]  InfoWars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
[02:10:53.996 --> 02:10:57.298]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[02:10:57.298 --> 02:11:02.361]  No, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[02:11:02.361 --> 02:11:12.387]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[02:11:12.387 --> 02:11:14.648]  These people are of the devil.
[02:11:14.648 --> 02:11:16.569]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[02:11:18.010 --> 02:11:20.472]  Tell and demand accountability.
[02:11:20.472 --> 02:11:26.597]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[02:11:26.597 --> 02:11:34.044]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:11:34.044 --> 02:11:36.165]  The crowd is now moving forward toward the barrier.
[02:11:36.165 --> 02:11:41.029]  The police have been telling everybody they're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[02:11:41.029 --> 02:11:44.913]  Their defeat will be ultimately a crushing one.
[02:11:47.662 --> 02:11:53.788]  And that promo is a year old.
[02:11:53.788 --> 02:11:54.789]  A year old.
[02:11:54.789 --> 02:12:01.495]  Nine months later, President Trump won the presidency.
[02:12:01.495 --> 02:12:06.659]  You heard Lord Monty at the end, and I believe the defeat in the end will be a crushing defeat.
[02:12:06.659 --> 02:12:09.262]  We have history on our side.
[02:12:09.262 --> 02:12:10.363]  We're the real classical
[02:12:12.881 --> 02:12:13.521]  Liberals.
[02:12:13.521 --> 02:12:15.082]  Now, Roger Stone has some breaking news.
[02:12:15.082 --> 02:12:16.763]  He's going to pop in for five minutes.
[02:12:16.763 --> 02:12:17.923]  He's at an airport.
[02:12:17.923 --> 02:12:20.144]  Go ahead and call him on his phone, guys.
[02:12:20.144 --> 02:12:24.166]  I'm going to go back to Joaquin, formerly in the Army, in the Airborne.
[02:12:24.166 --> 02:12:26.387]  He was getting into the fact he's now a pastor.
[02:12:26.387 --> 02:12:34.210]  He was making the point that, Alex, you keep saying Trump's surrounded, which is true at the higher echelons of the Democratic and Republican Party, the top globalists.
[02:12:34.210 --> 02:12:42.134]  But with the people, especially the military, the intelligence agencies, and people lower level in corporations, but in management positions, they're almost all for Trump.
[02:12:43.072 --> 02:12:44.653]  That's why you see the stock market exploding.
[02:12:44.653 --> 02:12:46.314]  That's why you see so much happening.
[02:12:46.314 --> 02:12:48.075]  We have the intel everywhere, folks.
[02:12:48.075 --> 02:12:48.995]  It's incredible.
[02:12:48.995 --> 02:12:50.556]  This is like Fight Club.
[02:12:50.556 --> 02:12:52.017]  So, Joaquin, go ahead and make your points.
[02:12:52.017 --> 02:12:53.997]  Thank you for holding.
[02:12:53.997 --> 02:12:54.558]  No problem.
[02:12:54.558 --> 02:12:55.438]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:12:55.438 --> 02:13:08.525]  So, as I was watching the evolution of this revolution, it became quite clear that the insurmountable obstacles that Trump was facing dictated the very essence of this struggle that this nation is facing.
[02:13:09.435 --> 02:13:12.136]  What is happening is on a spiritual level.
[02:13:12.136 --> 02:13:15.397]  Yes, we are engaged in physical battles here on Earth.
[02:13:15.397 --> 02:13:28.921]  Has it not ever been more cut and dry with open marches and devil worshippers saying, Satan killed Trump, and Trump invoking God and bringing God back in, and then now all this providence, golden touch that Trump has, everything they touch blows up.
[02:13:30.333 --> 02:13:31.934]  That is exactly my point.
[02:13:31.934 --> 02:13:36.178]  And you had asked earlier, what can Trump do to continue his agenda?
[02:13:36.178 --> 02:13:39.040]  And that is the very essence of this whole movement.
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:42.743]  The invoking of the birthright and bringing God back into this.
[02:13:42.743 --> 02:13:52.651]  If Trump can get up to the bully pulpit and call the people back to repentance, and yes, I'm going to catch flack for this, but remember, I'm a minister now, but I wasn't 10 years ago.
[02:13:52.651 --> 02:13:53.552]  I was something else.
[02:13:53.932 --> 02:14:01.197]  And if it wasn't for the saving grace of Jesus Christ that was allowed me to be able to be the man that I am today, I wouldn't be here talking to you.
[02:14:01.197 --> 02:14:13.906]  So if Trump can just get that focus to get up there and have the courage to call people this nation back to repentance, God will flood this area with the prosperity that we had never even knew could possibly exist.
[02:14:13.906 --> 02:14:14.807]  And that is my point.
[02:14:16.138 --> 02:14:16.979]  Absolutely.
[02:14:16.979 --> 02:14:21.462]  And look, Trump has been a Christian for a long time, but he can feel the Spirit now rising.
[02:14:21.462 --> 02:14:24.304]  God is really moving the Holy Spirit in Trump.
[02:14:24.304 --> 02:14:27.025]  And I've had, me, I almost know the conversation I've had with Trump.
[02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:32.209]  We've talked about the Spirit feeling God, how he wants to help Christianity not be persecuted.
[02:14:32.209 --> 02:14:35.191]  That's what is really near and dear to Trump's heart.
[02:14:35.191 --> 02:14:39.033]  And, you know, it's just like God works in mysterious ways in the most unlikely of places.
[02:14:39.033 --> 02:14:40.354]  Donald Trump, he's doing it.
[02:14:40.354 --> 02:14:45.498]  And notice Hillary desperately this week is sort of saying, God bless, and trying to invoke God again because
[02:14:46.118 --> 02:14:47.379]  They wanted to get rid of all that.
[02:14:47.379 --> 02:14:54.867]  Now that they're panicking, she wants to keep Democrats that are on the fence from going to this movement because they understand how powerful this is.
[02:14:54.867 --> 02:14:57.850]  That's going to blow up in her face.
[02:14:57.850 --> 02:15:00.753]  She can't invoke the name of the living God.
[02:15:00.753 --> 02:15:02.234]  She didn't say Jesus Christ.
[02:15:02.234 --> 02:15:03.996]  She just said, God bless you.
[02:15:03.996 --> 02:15:05.537]  And it looked very, very strange.
[02:15:05.537 --> 02:15:07.399]  So they know what's happening.
[02:15:07.399 --> 02:15:09.281]  They're panicked right now.
[02:15:09.281 --> 02:15:10.182]  They better be panicked.
[02:15:11.710 --> 02:15:12.391]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:12.391 --> 02:15:15.433]  I appreciate you allowing me to come on here and talk to you.
[02:15:15.433 --> 02:15:15.954]  You're great.
[02:15:15.954 --> 02:15:16.915]  Just keep up the good work.
[02:15:16.915 --> 02:15:18.476]  We'll be praying for you as well.
[02:15:18.476 --> 02:15:21.699]  And we raise you up in church as well as the President.
[02:15:21.699 --> 02:15:33.189]  And I encourage all the ministers out there listening, I know there are some, to just get in the trenches every morning in prayer and put their hand on the screen and pray over these fantastic news articles you put out.
[02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:35.772]  That's how we do in wage battle here in the Spirit Realm.
[02:15:37.008 --> 02:15:38.389]  Well, it's funny you say that.
[02:15:38.389 --> 02:15:58.528]  Lucifer is the prince of the power of the air, and they make fun of preachers putting their hands on the television or whatever, but truly it's an electromagnetic system, and the point is it's just visualizing the fact that we're all together, and we're moving forward, and we're strong, and we love God, and we are going to see those that aren't completely turned over to evil, the scales come off their eyes.
[02:15:59.589 --> 02:16:24.512]  Like, you know, Paul on the road to Damascus back when he was Saul and just hoping that they get knocked from their horse and, you know, get back to really understanding the truth of what's happening because as I'm putting words in your mouth, I'd imagine you were pretty messed up, maybe PTSD, pretty scared, pretty upset, maybe turning towards the dark side after a lot of combat or something and that God and Christ Spirit and the Holy Spirit was able to turn you around and make you a new man.
[02:16:25.032 --> 02:16:32.020]  And, you know, putting God in charge, you know, literally coming into your spirit, coming into your soul, you know, redirecting all of that and cleansing you of that.
[02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:32.581]  Is that what happened?
[02:16:33.737 --> 02:16:35.778]  Well, that's very interesting you should ask that.
[02:16:35.778 --> 02:16:39.079]  I wrote a book, and if you don't mind, I'll promote it real quick.
[02:16:39.079 --> 02:16:41.019]  It's called Remember the Prisoners.
[02:16:41.019 --> 02:16:42.920]  He came to set the captives free.
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:47.501]  It's my true story of how I came to Christ and God to deliverance.
[02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:53.323]  I was involved in drugs and alcohol and crime and everything in between, and it was God.
[02:16:53.323 --> 02:16:58.905]  Jesus came in personally and met me in that prison cell and woke me up and gave me the revelation.
[02:16:58.905 --> 02:17:00.065]  You've heard the word epiphany.
[02:17:00.445 --> 02:17:04.449]  Well, epiphany actually is translated a divine revelation.
[02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:10.675]  And that's when the Spirit of God actually contacts the Spirit of man who we were created in and makes... That's right.
[02:17:10.675 --> 02:17:14.839]  And the ultimate sin is turning down that spirit when it actually comes to you.
[02:17:14.839 --> 02:17:15.700]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:16.560]  We never talked before.
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:18.482]  I just couldn't see what he was saying.
[02:17:18.482 --> 02:17:19.643]  And it's the truth.
[02:17:19.643 --> 02:17:21.025]  You're not going to find it in these big churches.
[02:17:21.025 --> 02:17:22.946]  Now, we're going to skip this break so we have time.
[02:17:22.946 --> 02:17:24.088]  Roger Stone sent me a text.
[02:17:24.688 --> 02:17:25.709]  And I was already aware of it.
[02:17:25.709 --> 02:17:26.749]  I had mentioned it earlier.
[02:17:26.749 --> 02:17:27.790]  We should have made a bigger deal of it.
[02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:29.611]  It just broke in the last hour.
[02:17:29.611 --> 02:17:33.113]  No evidence of Trump campaign contacts with Russia.
[02:17:33.113 --> 02:17:38.016]  The House Intelligence Committee probed into possible improper contacts between Donald Trump, presidential campaign, and Russia.
[02:17:38.016 --> 02:17:39.416]  Has not found any evidence yet.
[02:17:39.416 --> 02:17:41.037]  According to the Republican committee chair.
[02:17:41.037 --> 02:17:46.761]  Now remember, we were told two months before the campaign, we were told on the day of the inauguration,
[02:17:47.521 --> 02:17:51.824]  That they had the evidence and it was being given to Congress, and then Congress keeps saying, they won't give it to us.
[02:17:51.824 --> 02:17:53.426]  Well, they finally gave it to them.
[02:17:53.426 --> 02:18:00.752]  It's the same CIA report we saw of four-year-old RT shows saying bad things about Hillary.
[02:18:00.752 --> 02:18:03.494]  When they call it hacking, they mean Russians didn't like Hillary.
[02:18:03.494 --> 02:18:07.417]  Well, a bunch of other people didn't either, but all the other media, all the foreign governments piled on against Trump.
[02:18:07.417 --> 02:18:09.819]  It was a hundred to one MSM against Trump.
[02:18:09.819 --> 02:18:12.100]  That's admitted.
[02:18:12.100 --> 02:18:16.324]  A hundred to zero Goldman Sachs donations to Hillary, not to Trump, but we hear he's Goldman Sachs.
[02:18:17.489 --> 02:18:19.811]  And they kept saying, Roger Stone's the kingpin.
[02:18:19.811 --> 02:18:20.451]  He's with WikiLeaks.
[02:18:20.451 --> 02:18:22.252]  He works for Putin.
[02:18:22.252 --> 02:18:24.654]  And they were going to have congressional hearings in a month.
[02:18:24.654 --> 02:18:27.096]  Stone gets hit with polonium to kill him.
[02:18:27.096 --> 02:18:31.478]  He doesn't get the full dose, the CDC believes, but it's polonium.
[02:18:31.478 --> 02:18:37.943]  The FBI comes out to his house, Secret Service, all the nine yards, you know, to talk to him about it.
[02:18:37.943 --> 02:18:39.224]  He wants to testify to Congress.
[02:18:39.224 --> 02:18:42.426]  You see, they wanted him dead so they could then have the hearings and blame it on Stone.
[02:18:42.426 --> 02:18:43.527]  But he didn't get the full dose.
[02:18:44.517 --> 02:18:45.517]  This is incredible.
[02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:52.621]  So Justice Stone said for month after month after month, I never met, never talked, no emails, total bull, metaphor total bull.
[02:18:52.621 --> 02:18:54.922]  They had to wait till the National Security Advisor.
[02:18:56.195 --> 02:19:03.240]  On December 15th, General Flynn talked to the Russians about setting up phone calls with the President in official business.
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:05.782]  And then he got run out because the Russians said, we want to talk about sanctions.
[02:19:05.782 --> 02:19:08.164]  He said, well, you've got to talk to the President about that.
[02:19:08.164 --> 02:19:10.966]  They said, well, technically you said you'd talk about sanctions.
[02:19:10.966 --> 02:19:14.108]  Well, of course I mentioned them, but that wasn't talking about sanctions.
[02:19:14.108 --> 02:19:14.969]  So he's gone now.
[02:19:15.549 --> 02:19:17.692]  This is unbelievable.
[02:19:17.692 --> 02:19:19.294]  So they're saying we haven't gotten the proof.
[02:19:19.294 --> 02:19:20.936]  We've gotten all their documents.
[02:19:20.936 --> 02:19:22.118]  There's not even phone calls.
[02:19:22.118 --> 02:19:23.400]  There's nothing here.
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:25.923]  But as we've written, there's Hillary getting money directly from Putin.
[02:19:25.923 --> 02:19:28.467]  I'm not saying Putin's even bad, folks.
[02:19:28.467 --> 02:19:30.449]  You're supposed to try to infiltrate other governments to influence them.
[02:19:30.990 --> 02:19:32.210]  The point is, it's Hillary.
[02:19:32.210 --> 02:19:32.771]  They're the ones.
[02:19:32.771 --> 02:19:34.171]  It's coming out everywhere.
[02:19:34.171 --> 02:19:40.093]  That's why they said he was the Russian asset, because if anybody is, she's a Chinese communist asset.
[02:19:40.093 --> 02:19:42.373]  The guy that exposed all that's in hiding right now.
[02:19:42.373 --> 02:19:43.454]  So this is all unraveling.
[02:19:43.454 --> 02:19:48.035]  We're going to get Congressman Kurt Weldon, former head of the intelligence community, on to break more of this.
[02:19:48.035 --> 02:19:49.295]  He was on last week.
[02:19:49.295 --> 02:19:51.676]  So, Roger Stoneau, you're jumping on a plane in like 10 minutes.
[02:19:52.096 --> 02:19:54.178]  We're going to go back to calls after that, callers.
[02:19:54.178 --> 02:19:55.599]  But this is big.
[02:19:55.599 --> 02:19:56.719]  Exactly what you said.
[02:19:56.719 --> 02:19:58.260]  There is no proof.
[02:19:58.260 --> 02:19:59.762]  You want to be before Congress.
[02:19:59.762 --> 02:20:04.245]  I think Trump should call for the hearings himself and demand they have them to show what frauds they are.
[02:20:05.123 --> 02:20:08.305]  He should also declassify all the documents in this matter.
[02:20:08.305 --> 02:20:11.768]  Look, Alex, I'm at the airport here in Miami.
[02:20:11.768 --> 02:20:16.691]  I am on my way to Washington to meet with my lawyers.
[02:20:16.691 --> 02:20:26.719]  We were anticipating some action against the government because, as you know, according to The Guardian, the secret FISA court
[02:20:27.499 --> 02:20:39.970]  I ordered a warrant to approve the surveillance of my text phone, my cell phone, my text, my email, all of my communications reportedly over a year ago.
[02:20:41.165 --> 02:20:47.269]  And as you know, in the FISA court, no probable cause or evidence is required.
[02:20:47.269 --> 02:20:48.689]  It's a political charge.
[02:20:48.689 --> 02:21:02.357]  So they've heard us talk about what they really wanted, President Trump, and strategy, claiming you were a Russian agent, allowed the presidency, Obama, to illegally spy on one of the unofficial advisors of his rival.
[02:21:02.357 --> 02:21:04.058]  This is incredible criminal activity.
[02:21:04.904 --> 02:21:05.244]  Yeah, I know.
[02:21:05.244 --> 02:21:13.812]  It's a reverse Watergate in many ways, because you're privy to all memos and campaign strategy items that I wrote of my own opinion.
[02:21:13.812 --> 02:21:18.157]  All of my private communication, plus all my personal information.
[02:21:18.157 --> 02:21:20.399]  I mean, who doesn't talk to their wife on email?
[02:21:20.399 --> 02:21:21.760]  Well, remember, you got hacked.
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:22.701]  You got hacked repeatedly.
[02:21:23.948 --> 02:21:25.750]  So it is outrage.
[02:21:25.750 --> 02:21:28.413]  It's a suspension of our Constitution.
[02:21:28.413 --> 02:21:33.640]  As you know, the Vice of Court Rubberstein's 99% of the government's requests.
[02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:35.462]  This was a fishing expedition.
[02:21:35.462 --> 02:21:42.891]  And even the chairman said today that all the information regarding Stone chases back to media stories.
[02:21:43.812 --> 02:21:48.095]  Media stories that report something is happening, but we can't find any evidence that it actually happened.
[02:21:48.095 --> 02:21:48.876]  Let's be clear.
[02:21:48.876 --> 02:22:02.025]  They report on reports of reports, and then in Ring Around the Rosie, never say where the evidence came from, and then put out a 30-something page report that has YouTube videos on it, saying, look, RT did a negative piece on Hillary.
[02:22:02.025 --> 02:22:03.787]  That's their proof that we're all Russian agents.
[02:22:05.091 --> 02:22:07.913]  Yeah, so this is a giant blow.
[02:22:07.913 --> 02:22:20.059]  Of course, anyone who reads my book, The Making of the President of 2016, already knows this narrative, understands, because I debunked the entire Russian fraud right there in the book, extensively.
[02:22:20.059 --> 02:22:22.801]  The notion that you and I are in the service of Putin.
[02:22:23.484 --> 02:22:25.325]  This is an absurdity.
[02:22:25.325 --> 02:22:27.026]  It's the new McCarthyism.
[02:22:27.026 --> 02:22:27.726]  Well, let me do this.
[02:22:27.726 --> 02:22:28.887]  Let me do this.
[02:22:28.887 --> 02:22:30.828]  I want to make this particularly clear to everybody.
[02:22:30.828 --> 02:22:33.669]  I know privately you've told me you are planning lawsuits.
[02:22:33.669 --> 02:22:39.332]  You have to do this for the country, for yourself, for Trump, for everybody to get back on the offense.
[02:22:39.332 --> 02:22:40.432]  We know this is all a lie.
[02:22:40.432 --> 02:22:42.313]  It's coming out it's a lie.
[02:22:42.313 --> 02:22:46.676]  They need to have these hearings so you can go into Congress and get your good name back.
[02:22:46.676 --> 02:22:51.298]  They need to all correct what they've done or tell us who you're going to be forced to sue.
[02:22:52.554 --> 02:22:53.795]  Well, here's the problem, Alex.
[02:22:53.795 --> 02:22:59.099]  Generally speaking, a great man once told me, don't sue people who buy ink by the barrel.
[02:22:59.099 --> 02:23:02.582]  On the other hand, in the new age, everybody has their own cannon.
[02:23:02.582 --> 02:23:04.924]  So why not have a war?
[02:23:04.924 --> 02:23:11.709]  You know, I frankly think the New York Times and the Washington Post have misrepresented the situation on the basis of no evidence.
[02:23:11.709 --> 02:23:22.038]  They were led down a road path by people who have fancy titles in the CIA and others who have higher credibility with them in operations.
[02:23:23.025 --> 02:23:38.868]  This is a classical, classic intelligence agency, mainstream media setup, particularly with those two organs which they've had long control and influence in, particularly the Post.
[02:23:38.868 --> 02:23:46.350]  And I should add, they are now saying, the head of the Intelligence Committee, Nunes, is now saying exactly what you've been saying for
[02:23:47.506 --> 02:23:58.453]  Really, six months, but it got more intense three months ago, saying, we have communiqués where Stone, Manafort, and some guy you don't even know are getting direct orders from the Russians and are under Russian command.
[02:23:58.453 --> 02:24:00.395]  You keep saying, this is total lies.
[02:24:00.395 --> 02:24:01.255]  Let me see it.
[02:24:01.255 --> 02:24:04.437]  And they always just say they have reports of reports and they never release it.
[02:24:04.437 --> 02:24:08.960]  And now the head of the Intelligence Committee says they have no evidence.
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:17.286]  It's a pile of news articles all reporting on each other, but no phone calls, no phone calls, no emails, no nothing.
[02:24:19.366 --> 02:24:30.429]  What's really amazing, of course, is the other night on MSNBC, I saw some swine named Norm Rothkopf predicting that I would be indicted and sent to prison.
[02:24:30.429 --> 02:24:46.353]  So, you know, talk is cheap, but all you've got are these battering nabobs of negativism on the far left who have made this whole Trump-Russia-Putin meme up from the get-go.
[02:24:47.344 --> 02:24:57.115]  I mean, I'm not sure what they showed the FISA court to convince them to give them this warrant to violate my civil liberties, but it was probably Hillary Clinton press release.
[02:24:58.936 --> 02:25:02.317]  Well, it'll all come out in court, and that's the great part about depositions.
[02:25:02.317 --> 02:25:07.678]  We've got to do this, though, because they're trying to bring the President down with these lies, and as Trump keeps saying, release everything.
[02:25:07.678 --> 02:25:08.398]  There's nothing here.
[02:25:08.398 --> 02:25:10.419]  I don't even talk to the Russians.
[02:25:10.419 --> 02:25:12.779]  And the Russians have the GDP of Italy.
[02:25:12.779 --> 02:25:14.959]  They've got a powerful military, but that's it.
[02:25:14.959 --> 02:25:23.741]  I'm not bashing the Russians, but, I mean, it's a complete joke when the Vatican and the EU and the Communist Chinese are openly telling us we can't have Trump.
[02:25:23.741 --> 02:25:25.942]  The Saudi Arabians give 20% of our campaign money.
[02:25:26.582 --> 02:25:34.525]  I mean, I really think we need to hear calls from Sessions and others for criminal investigations of Hillary when it's public that she's a communist Chinese spy.
[02:25:34.525 --> 02:25:45.209]  I mean, if they want to make up this lie and get in this arena, is it turnabout fair play when really she's the agent?
[02:25:45.209 --> 02:25:47.550]  Alright, I gotta hit my gig.
[02:25:47.550 --> 02:25:48.831]  I understand you gotta go, Roger.
[02:25:48.831 --> 02:25:49.811]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:25:51.325 --> 02:25:52.025]  Now, there he goes.
[02:25:52.025 --> 02:25:55.147]  I got too loud there as he's going to the TSA.
[02:25:55.147 --> 02:25:57.588]  Okay, I want to go back to your phone calls.
[02:25:57.588 --> 02:26:05.311]  It's just that... These people are crazy.
[02:26:05.311 --> 02:26:14.035]  It's the Democratic Party, historically, that has had the Russians funding them and involving them, but that went away
[02:26:15.069 --> 02:26:16.349]  By the 80s.
[02:26:16.349 --> 02:26:25.492]  But there was some major Russian connections with Senator Kennedy and people going and actually trying to get paid money by the Russians to do things in Congress.
[02:26:25.492 --> 02:26:28.173]  Really serious stuff.
[02:26:28.173 --> 02:26:30.433]  And sex operatives, Russian sex operatives.
[02:26:30.433 --> 02:26:35.034]  But by the 90s, that all pretty much stopped.
[02:26:35.034 --> 02:26:39.376]  Since then, the Russians have been trying to make business deals.
[02:26:39.376 --> 02:26:42.036]  That's how things really get done.
[02:26:42.036 --> 02:26:44.057]  And then you look at what's happening now,
[02:26:45.421 --> 02:26:57.494]  The Communist Chinese are very public about the fact that they are the biggest, most powerful lobby outside of the military-industrial complex lobby, the big banking lobby.
[02:26:57.494 --> 02:27:00.437]  There is an Israel lobby that's very powerful.
[02:27:00.437 --> 02:27:05.263]  But if you really look at things, it's the Communist Chinese, in many cases, allied with Islamist groups.
[02:27:06.479 --> 02:27:09.520]  That really are the muscle, the brains, and the funding.
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:14.241]  I mean, there are, Congress has estimated 10,000 Communist Chinese front companies.
[02:27:14.241 --> 02:27:26.225]  I've got two or three articles a day, I wasn't even looking for these, just in the news about, you know, Communist Chinese front groups in colleges, and you name it, and schools, and companies they set up for manufacturing to get other technology.
[02:27:26.225 --> 02:27:28.505]  I mean, they are in our business, man.
[02:27:28.505 --> 02:27:32.266]  They are in our business.
[02:27:32.266 --> 02:27:34.587]  And they're just quietly beavering away to take over.
[02:27:38.032 --> 02:27:38.973]  But not so quietly.
[02:27:38.973 --> 02:27:43.856]  Now they're in the news a lot saying, you know what?
[02:27:43.856 --> 02:27:45.037]  We're buying up all of Hollywood.
[02:27:45.037 --> 02:27:46.158]  We're going to tell you what to say and what to do.
[02:27:46.158 --> 02:27:49.120]  And we're going to help you shut down Donald Trump and the alt-right.
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:51.681]  We're going to help you censor the way we do.
[02:27:51.681 --> 02:27:52.962]  We ban fake news first.
[02:27:52.962 --> 02:27:55.464]  And our fake news goes, you're so wonderful.
[02:27:55.464 --> 02:27:59.447]  I know I make this point every day, but I mean, you can go read the articles everywhere where our media praises
[02:28:00.865 --> 02:28:02.526]  The Communist Chinese.
[02:28:02.526 --> 02:28:03.426]  And everything they've done.
[02:28:03.426 --> 02:28:05.727]  And says, oh, can you help us with our problem?
[02:28:05.727 --> 02:28:06.528]  Oh, you bet.
[02:28:06.528 --> 02:28:07.789]  See how right we are now?
[02:28:07.789 --> 02:28:08.249]  Yeah.
[02:28:08.249 --> 02:28:11.550]  Putting people in mobile execution vans to criticize the government.
[02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:14.472]  Or taking Buddhists that secretly practice their faith and killing them.
[02:28:14.472 --> 02:28:17.974]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:28:17.974 --> 02:28:18.674]  Yeah, scroll down.
[02:28:18.674 --> 02:28:19.394]  There's PC World.
[02:28:19.394 --> 02:28:20.095]  Scroll down, I'll read it.
[02:28:20.970 --> 02:28:26.133]  The current debate over fake online news has one country feeling vindicated, China.
[02:28:26.133 --> 02:28:31.137]  For years, its controversial censorship system has been cracking down on so-called online rumors.
[02:28:31.137 --> 02:28:32.498]  Yeah, killing people.
[02:28:32.498 --> 02:28:37.261]  And last week, a state-controlled newspaper essentially told the U.S., I told you so.
[02:28:37.261 --> 02:28:46.367]  Well, much further than that, they said, we're going to help advise you, we're going to help censor, and Zuckerberg can come back in, and Google can come back in as soon as you shut down your troublemakers.
[02:28:48.985 --> 02:28:51.806]  We're going to go to break and come back with your phone calls.
[02:28:51.806 --> 02:28:53.286]  And then we got David Knight taking over.
[02:28:53.286 --> 02:29:00.349]  But for the start of the David Knight piece, we're going to premiere a report about the Satanists openly saying they're coming after and want to get Trump.
[02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:01.809]  But I thought there's no occultist after Trump.
[02:29:01.809 --> 02:29:02.930]  I thought that was a conspiracy theory.
[02:29:02.930 --> 02:29:03.230]  Briefly.
[02:29:04.753 --> 02:29:11.056]  We're gonna have a 50% discount today on Colloidal Silver and 35% off on Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[02:29:30.399 --> 02:29:31.880]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:33.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.770 --> 02:30:05.677]  A measuring stick for decorum in Congress is approaching, as President Trump is set to deliver his first address to Congress.
[02:30:05.677 --> 02:30:20.634]  In an event classified by its dignity and demeanor, the presidential address will certainly be shadowed by the Democrat trolls, who are planning on bringing guests such as Muslim Americans and Dreamers, in a sad attempt to tug at the heartstrings of America's electorate, and in an attempt to cast Trump as the bad guy.
[02:30:20.854 --> 02:30:31.257]  So instead of concern for their constituents in the states and counties that they represent, they're out casting nets in a search effort to find political pawns they can use against Trump in the psychological battle of optics.
[02:30:31.257 --> 02:30:39.799]  This is also an opportunity for Trump to, again, sound the sirens of nationalism against globalism, and America First policies that will bring jobs back to America.
[02:30:39.799 --> 02:30:44.860]  InfoWars will have live coverage of Trump's address to Congress, with the nightly news starting tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[02:30:44.860 --> 02:30:47.641]  Central, then rolling right into live coverage of Trump's address.
[02:30:48.061 --> 02:30:53.312]  Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said the theme of Trump's address will be the renewal of the American spirit.
[02:30:53.312 --> 02:30:56.438]  Of course, the never-Trump Democrats would try to deter that.
[02:30:56.438 --> 02:30:58.643]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:30:59.392 --> 02:31:07.659]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[02:31:07.659 --> 02:31:08.880]  A 360 win.
[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:15.446]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:31:15.446 --> 02:31:20.110]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:23.352]  Because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:31:23.352 --> 02:31:28.036]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:31:28.036 --> 02:31:34.540]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:42.326]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:31:42.326 --> 02:31:48.791]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:31:49.532 --> 02:31:50.493]  10% off on AutoShip.
[02:31:50.493 --> 02:31:52.937]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:54.940]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:31:54.940 --> 02:31:59.326]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:31:59.326 --> 02:32:01.169]  Today we call it Bone Broth.
[02:32:01.169 --> 02:32:04.394]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits.
[02:32:04.514 --> 02:32:10.918]  Before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk, we are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[02:32:10.918 --> 02:32:20.703]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:32:20.703 --> 02:32:21.544]  Caveman.
[02:32:21.544 --> 02:32:26.607]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:32:26.607 --> 02:32:28.728]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:29.028 --> 02:32:32.170]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:32.170 --> 02:32:37.312]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:37.312 --> 02:32:45.456]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:53.400]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:58.062]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WordsLive.com today.
[02:33:16.877 --> 02:33:23.984]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance!
[02:33:23.984 --> 02:33:25.725]  Yeah!
[02:33:25.725 --> 02:33:27.727]  Yeah!
[02:33:27.727 --> 02:33:35.074]  We now, we now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:35.074 --> 02:33:37.516]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:54.734]  But I think about never giving up and just having my will run over whatever's in front of me.
[02:33:54.734 --> 02:33:58.857]  I can't ever help but just punch my teeth together.
[02:33:58.857 --> 02:34:05.001]  You think about Hillary and the globalists and all their crap and all their satanism and all their evil out in the open?
[02:34:05.001 --> 02:34:14.667]  Just imagine the truth spreading and prosperity and all their evil being crushed and defeated.
[02:34:14.667 --> 02:34:16.068]  Yeah, we're an American band.
[02:34:17.441 --> 02:34:18.481]  America first!
[02:34:18.481 --> 02:34:30.044]  If you don't have a country, you don't have a firewall and a system to protect you from the big multinationals that want to come in and rape you and financially loot you!
[02:34:30.044 --> 02:34:32.205]  Yeah!
[02:34:32.205 --> 02:34:40.707]  Oh, but Glenn Beck says it's frightening that Trump wants to have nationalism and economic nationalism.
[02:34:40.707 --> 02:34:42.667]  What's the country for?
[02:34:42.667 --> 02:34:45.028]  You little creature!
[02:34:45.028 --> 02:34:45.508]  You traitor!
[02:34:47.099 --> 02:34:48.980]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:52.062]  It's very scary that he wants nationalism and economic nationalism.
[02:34:52.062 --> 02:34:53.403]  That's not conservative.
[02:34:53.403 --> 02:34:57.086]  No, having a country isn't conservative.
[02:34:57.086 --> 02:35:06.552]  The level of bull that comes out of these people's mouths, they're like, our really big lies didn't work, so let's tell really humongous ones that are ridiculously big.
[02:35:06.552 --> 02:35:08.273]  Yeah, yeah, let's do it.
[02:35:08.273 --> 02:35:09.114]  That's the plan.
[02:35:09.114 --> 02:35:15.278]  It's like the Pope.
[02:35:16.818 --> 02:35:18.298]  I can't stand Christian roots.
[02:35:18.298 --> 02:35:20.399]  They're disgusting in Europe.
[02:35:20.399 --> 02:35:22.599]  And there is no such thing as Islamic terror.
[02:35:22.599 --> 02:35:30.601]  Now the main guy, Le Pen, is way ahead of in the polls, but her main opposition came out, is the Rothschild candidate, and openly says, you cannot stop the open borders.
[02:35:30.601 --> 02:35:33.261]  You cannot stop Islam.
[02:35:33.261 --> 02:35:35.082]  It will take over Europe.
[02:35:35.082 --> 02:35:36.582]  First, oh, there's no Islam problem.
[02:35:36.582 --> 02:35:37.702]  Oh, it doesn't want to take over.
[02:35:37.702 --> 02:35:39.202]  Now, you will assimilate.
[02:35:39.202 --> 02:35:40.483]  You will never stop us.
[02:35:40.483 --> 02:35:41.163]  Lay down.
[02:35:41.163 --> 02:35:41.523]  Take it.
[02:35:44.241 --> 02:35:48.022]  Taxpayer-funded schools suspected of Chinese espionage.
[02:35:48.022 --> 02:35:52.164]  Infowars.com.
[02:35:52.164 --> 02:35:57.946]  Under investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Services.
[02:35:57.946 --> 02:36:01.587]  Expect indiscriminate attacks by Islamic terrorist British citizens warned by their government.
[02:36:01.587 --> 02:36:02.647]  Infowars.com.
[02:36:02.647 --> 02:36:04.048]  Here it is, Infowars.com.
[02:36:04.048 --> 02:36:06.909]  Le Pen Rothschild rival.
[02:36:06.909 --> 02:36:10.070]  Muslim mass migration unstoppable.
[02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:12.471]  Le Pen's opponent claims global warming behind Muslim
[02:36:13.325 --> 02:36:17.466]  Migration, oh yeah, not the globalists destabilizing the Middle East or putting radicals in charge.
[02:36:17.466 --> 02:36:24.348]  Gotta love that level of baloney.
[02:36:24.348 --> 02:36:30.950]  I'm gonna go back to your phone calls now, but let's put up on screen, were you guys able to find what I was talking about?
[02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:32.230]  The new T-shirt!
[02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:41.893]  And I've been thinking and I've been thinking and I've been thinking and I've been thinking and I've been thinking about what is the next shirt to be even bigger than the Obama Joker shirt?
[02:36:43.729 --> 02:36:50.013]  Or the Hillary for Prison shirt that sent shockwaves across the country and also helped fund her operation.
[02:36:50.013 --> 02:36:53.295]  It looks just like the Hillary for Prison shirt, but it's even better.
[02:36:53.295 --> 02:36:57.637]  Trump Pants 2020, Keeping America Great.
[02:36:57.637 --> 02:37:00.799]  It's navy blue shirt, Infowars.com on the right shoulder.
[02:37:00.799 --> 02:37:03.901]  And on the back, it's got another message.
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:08.122]  America first since 1776.
[02:37:08.122 --> 02:37:09.603]  Yeah, we have a country.
[02:37:09.603 --> 02:37:11.504]  How evil, how nasty, how dirty.
[02:37:11.504 --> 02:37:13.145]  Infowars.com.
[02:37:13.145 --> 02:37:21.190]  This is the shirt you wear everywhere to find like-minded people, but to also not let the intimidators know that you're going to roll over.
[02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:23.712]  Let them know you're going to stand up.
[02:37:23.712 --> 02:37:26.874]  Now, the shirt's being made right here in America as we speak.
[02:37:26.874 --> 02:37:29.015]  It'll be here in about a week and be shipped out.
[02:37:29.015 --> 02:37:31.657]  So to be safe, let's just say two weeks.
[02:37:31.657 --> 02:37:34.919]  Everyone that pre-orders now, and I want this to be the viral shirt,
[02:37:36.457 --> 02:37:38.518]  In cyberspace, but in the real world as well.
[02:37:38.518 --> 02:37:40.758]  Take photos of yourself, your Instagram, your Twitter.
[02:37:40.758 --> 02:37:41.859]  Tweet it out.
[02:37:41.859 --> 02:37:44.900]  TrumpPants2020.
[02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:47.621]  I had this planned months ago, talking to Q and others.
[02:37:47.621 --> 02:37:49.901]  We need to get on this, and I finally cracked some whips.
[02:37:49.901 --> 02:37:51.162]  We got it going here.
[02:37:51.162 --> 02:37:52.782]  Infowars.com.
[02:37:52.782 --> 02:37:57.124]  TrumpPants2020.
[02:37:57.124 --> 02:37:57.144]  $9.95.
[02:37:57.144 --> 02:38:01.685]  The shirt costs us like five bucks, but you buy it now, you'll get it half price. $9.95.
[02:38:05.506 --> 02:38:08.428]  I'm going to try to keep the price low even after it actually comes in.
[02:38:08.428 --> 02:38:09.429]  Then the price will go up to say $14.95.
[02:38:09.429 --> 02:38:10.930]  We need some capital.
[02:38:10.930 --> 02:38:12.211]  We need to fund our operation here.
[02:38:12.211 --> 02:38:14.093]  We've got other great shirts like Infowars.com.
[02:38:14.093 --> 02:38:16.755]  My free speech doesn't end when you're offended.
[02:38:16.755 --> 02:38:17.675]  Things like that.
[02:38:17.675 --> 02:38:18.856]  Hillary for President 2017.
[02:38:18.856 --> 02:38:21.738]  Deport George Soros.
[02:38:21.738 --> 02:38:24.000]  Again, we printed a whole bunch when we stopped making.
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:25.401]  We've got some shirts left.
[02:38:25.401 --> 02:38:26.222]  Trump is my president.
[02:38:27.642 --> 02:38:28.683]  I'm going to come up with some new colors.
[02:38:28.683 --> 02:38:31.526]  That was the collector's shirt, but we still got that available.
[02:38:31.526 --> 02:38:36.830]  And when you get the shirts, whether they're Molon Labe, come and take it, Texas variant, we've got it all.
[02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:39.833]  It funds this operation, that it takes a lot of money to fund this.
[02:38:39.833 --> 02:38:40.614]  And you're the audience.
[02:38:40.614 --> 02:38:41.895]  This is a show.
[02:38:41.895 --> 02:38:44.577]  We were funding ourselves with Google Ads through AdRoll.
[02:38:44.577 --> 02:38:46.039]  That's who they make you go to.
[02:38:46.039 --> 02:38:48.120]  They said, sorry, you're fake news.
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:49.021]  You're not human.
[02:38:49.021 --> 02:38:49.662]  You don't exist.
[02:38:49.662 --> 02:38:51.163]  No access to the market.
[02:38:51.163 --> 02:38:52.564]  You can no longer advertise on Google.
[02:38:52.564 --> 02:38:53.025]  You don't exist.
[02:38:55.976 --> 02:38:57.617]  So, more than ever, we gotta come to you.
[02:38:57.617 --> 02:39:02.479]  You notice I've been plugging a little bit more, a little bit more juicily, because, you know, I gotta, I gotta find other ways.
[02:39:02.479 --> 02:39:04.280]  I'm trying to find other third-party places to advertise.
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:08.461]  I mean, if I could advertise outside the show, I wouldn't have ads here.
[02:39:08.461 --> 02:39:09.242]  Seriously.
[02:39:09.242 --> 02:39:13.524]  If I could advertise, R-Info, bring people here, then I wouldn't even have any ads.
[02:39:13.524 --> 02:39:14.624]  Seriously.
[02:39:14.624 --> 02:39:21.327]  But we've been going outside the show to advertise, so the whole show doesn't have to be advertisements to pay to get the message out, and they take that away.
[02:39:22.619 --> 02:39:22.739]  Hello.
[02:39:22.739 --> 02:39:23.039]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:23.039 --> 02:39:25.281]  First time caller and first time listener.
[02:39:52.202 --> 02:40:03.665]  Yeah, I wanted to just talk on immigration a little bit, and trade, and the consequences of that, H-1B visas.
[02:40:03.665 --> 02:40:14.648]  To start, on the Statue of Liberty, it's got that famous, give me your tired, poor, so on, phrase.
[02:40:14.648 --> 02:40:20.810]  And it's kind of used as the rallying cry for open immigration.
[02:40:21.881 --> 02:40:24.323]  But there's a sentence before that.
[02:40:24.323 --> 02:40:27.165]  Let me just read two sentences from the poem.
[02:40:27.165 --> 02:40:30.347]  That's Emma Lazar.
[02:40:30.347 --> 02:40:32.989]  Keep storied lands, your storied pomp.
[02:40:32.989 --> 02:40:34.009]  Excuse me.
[02:40:34.009 --> 02:40:38.753]  Keep storied lands, your ancient pomp, cries she.
[02:40:38.753 --> 02:40:47.098]  With silent voice, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free.
[02:40:47.098 --> 02:40:49.820]  I take from that when they say, keep
[02:40:50.834 --> 02:40:54.717]  Storied lands.
[02:40:54.717 --> 02:40:58.300]  Ancient pomp.
[02:40:58.300 --> 02:41:14.993]  Basically, it's the values of aristocracy and so on from Europe were rejected by this new American idea of freedom and liberty.
[02:41:19.241 --> 02:41:26.166]  On the second sentence, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
[02:41:26.166 --> 02:41:35.452]  That's a requirement, given Lady Liberty's quote.
[02:41:35.452 --> 02:41:44.718]  If they're not yearning to breathe free, that torch should be a hand held up stopping people.
[02:41:46.365 --> 02:41:46.866]  That's right.
[02:41:46.866 --> 02:41:48.447]  It's saying we're going to do things differently.
[02:41:48.447 --> 02:41:52.289]  We're not going to have royalty and elites and arrogance and pomp and garbage.
[02:41:52.289 --> 02:42:08.099]  If you're poor and you're tired of the New World Order, of globalism, of all this corrupt imperial garbage going back thousands of years, if you want to come here and really build something new based on what you produce and who you really are and not the class system, then come here.
[02:42:08.499 --> 02:42:15.781]  But if you want to be part of the old system and come here and play God, we don't want you here.
[02:42:15.781 --> 02:42:24.704]  So now they're trying to bring people here as part of globalism to be liberal haters who want to bring down our system as a colonizing force of the globalists.
[02:42:24.704 --> 02:42:28.025]  In fact, let's put the full poem up on screen since you mentioned it.
[02:42:28.025 --> 02:42:29.345]  Let's go to the poem.
[02:42:29.345 --> 02:42:31.826]  And I forget, who wrote the New Colossus?
[02:42:31.826 --> 02:42:32.806]  If you scroll down, it'll say.
[02:42:36.468 --> 02:42:38.449]  Let me read it while you guys find out.
[02:42:38.449 --> 02:42:40.391]  Thank you.
[02:42:40.391 --> 02:42:43.873]  Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame.
[02:42:43.873 --> 02:42:46.435]  That's the Colossus of Rhodes.
[02:42:46.435 --> 02:42:53.999]  Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, with conquering limbs astride from land to land.
[02:42:53.999 --> 02:43:00.744]  Here at our washed sunset gates shall stand a mighty woman with a torch, whose flame is the
[02:43:02.378 --> 02:43:08.340]  Imprisoned lightning and her name, mother of exiles.
[02:43:08.340 --> 02:43:12.902]  From her beacon hand glows worldwide welcome.
[02:43:12.902 --> 02:43:19.564]  Her mild eyes command the air, bridging harbour that the twin cities frame.
[02:43:19.564 --> 02:43:23.466]  Keep ancient lands your storied pomp, she cries.
[02:43:23.466 --> 02:43:26.147]  Yes, don't bring all your globals garbage here.
[02:43:26.923 --> 02:43:28.464]  Your empire here.
[02:43:28.464 --> 02:43:35.029]  She said with silent lips, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
[02:43:35.029 --> 02:43:36.931]  That's right.
[02:43:36.931 --> 02:43:40.793]  The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
[02:43:40.793 --> 02:43:44.676]  Send these, the homeless, tempest toast to me.
[02:43:44.676 --> 02:43:47.999]  I lift my lamp beside the golden door.
[02:43:47.999 --> 02:43:53.123]  But that's a nice poem off the statue that was actually meant for
[02:43:54.275 --> 02:43:55.596]  But yeah, more than that, it's a cultural thing too.
[02:44:26.011 --> 02:44:36.145]  I'm Irish, 20% or something, but I only celebrate my Irish heritage on St.
[02:44:36.145 --> 02:44:36.646]  Paddy's Day.
[02:44:37.142 --> 02:44:39.604]  Well sure, I mean I've got probably about the same amount of Irish in me.
[02:44:39.604 --> 02:44:46.089]  The whole point is it's all just Germanic tribes that are in the whole British Isles, and everybody's just been taught to fight with each other by kings.
[02:44:46.089 --> 02:44:49.171]  It's like brothers killing each other, but there's still hatred, you know.
[02:44:49.171 --> 02:44:51.613]  I had Irish fans come to hear me speak in England.
[02:44:51.613 --> 02:44:53.274]  They were like, I've never even been here until you were here.
[02:44:53.274 --> 02:44:55.796]  It's just like, I get it, but it doesn't matter.
[02:44:55.796 --> 02:45:00.080]  The Welsh got conquered by the British, and then it's all the same thing.
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:06.344]  But absolutely, they want you to come here, be in your own group, which then the globalists control.
[02:45:06.344 --> 02:45:06.885]  Anything else, sir?
[02:45:10.073 --> 02:45:34.612]  The outgrowth of this, though, and trade is another issue that I just wanted to touch on, and that is we're losing not only jobs but skills when we export manufacturing and when we import talent from China.
[02:45:36.661 --> 02:45:48.042]  The H-1B visa program, for example, takes a skilled job from an American source.
[02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:50.660]  Absolutely.
[02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:55.404]  They're saying, you know, bring people in that are entry-level workers, but back then you're going to be put to work and then be trained.
[02:45:55.404 --> 02:45:56.364]  I appreciate your call.
[02:45:56.364 --> 02:45:57.625]  Great points.
[02:45:57.625 --> 02:45:58.686]  And it's the same deal today.
[02:45:58.686 --> 02:46:02.788]  We are flooded more than anybody with immigrants, and then they try to turn them against us once they get here.
[02:46:02.788 --> 02:46:04.169]  Most of them aren't like that.
[02:46:04.169 --> 02:46:07.591]  The problem is, is that you've got seven plus billion people that want to come here.
[02:46:07.591 --> 02:46:10.673]  And if you bring a fraction of that, our wages are driven down.
[02:46:10.673 --> 02:46:16.977]  Until you stabilize wages in the third world, you cannot have prosperity here by bringing people in.
[02:46:16.977 --> 02:46:17.518]  Great points.
[02:46:18.490 --> 02:46:20.851]  I love the different angles, again, callers take us in.
[02:46:20.851 --> 02:46:25.973]  Bob in Washington, you're on the airs on the same subject, basically.
[02:46:25.973 --> 02:46:26.433]  Hello?
[02:46:26.433 --> 02:46:28.114]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:46:28.114 --> 02:46:38.518]  Yeah, no, I just, uh, I'm in Washington state and, uh, the governor just apparently made us be a sanctuary state, irregardless of what Trump said.
[02:46:38.518 --> 02:46:47.382]  And I'm from a little town, uh, about two hours north of Seattle called Bellingham and the city council last Monday,
[02:46:48.639 --> 02:46:52.804]  They all unanimously decided that Bellingham was going to be a sanctuary city.
[02:46:52.804 --> 02:46:54.065]  Sure, well here's the problem.
[02:46:54.065 --> 02:46:55.126]  Here's the deal.
[02:46:55.126 --> 02:46:59.551]  The feds are involved in hundreds of things they're not supposed to be involved in under the Constitution.
[02:46:59.551 --> 02:47:02.394]  But illegals running around is one.
[02:47:02.394 --> 02:47:06.098]  Trump's only saying if you've been here two weeks and we catch you, then we're going to send you back.
[02:47:06.098 --> 02:47:09.061]  Or if you're a felon or a criminal, deportations are actually down.
[02:47:09.642 --> 02:47:12.424]  Because they're doing targeted stuff and they intend to ramp that up.
[02:47:12.424 --> 02:47:13.345]  We have to do that.
[02:47:13.345 --> 02:47:15.526]  Every other country that has a nation does it.
[02:47:15.526 --> 02:47:19.369]  You're a failed state if you don't control who's in and out of the country.
[02:47:19.369 --> 02:47:24.993]  So all they're doing is maintaining life support level control and they're acting like it's the end of the world.
[02:47:24.993 --> 02:47:27.816]  Kind of like Len Beck saying, how dare he say we're a nation.
[02:47:27.816 --> 02:47:30.458]  That's dirty.
[02:47:30.458 --> 02:47:35.001]  They're trying to make normal activity look evil.
[02:47:35.001 --> 02:47:35.681]  Yep.
[02:47:35.681 --> 02:47:38.964]  Like my aunt went to the city council meeting
[02:47:39.790 --> 02:47:49.717]  And she wanted to, she signed up to speak, but when it was her turn to speak, there was a bunch of illegals in there, and they were just calling her a racist and a bigot, and she never even got to speak.
[02:47:49.717 --> 02:47:55.141]  Well, that's the one thing about the leftists and all the rest of them, they're really entitled, they're godlike, and you don't have speech.
[02:47:55.141 --> 02:48:00.045]  You're not gonna get yours, they're gonna shout you down, or they're gonna, you know, start chanting, hail Lucifer, hail Satan.
[02:48:00.045 --> 02:48:01.706]  That happened all over the country last week.
[02:48:01.706 --> 02:48:04.668]  We have a special report coming up at the start of the next hour that goes over all that.
[02:48:04.668 --> 02:48:05.209]  It's crazy!
[02:48:06.824 --> 02:48:17.871]  She was just trying to make a point that if the illegals are paying taxes, then obviously they stole somebody's identity and social security number, because how are they able to pay taxes?
[02:48:17.871 --> 02:48:23.335]  Look, it's systematic with whatever middle class is left to bring in an outside group and play them off against each other.
[02:48:23.335 --> 02:48:24.836]  They're just pawns as well.
[02:48:24.836 --> 02:48:25.876]  It's totally cold-blooded.
[02:48:25.876 --> 02:48:27.217]  It's very seditious.
[02:48:27.217 --> 02:48:29.819]  And what Trump's doing is the bare minimum.
[02:48:29.819 --> 02:48:31.800]  And I think because of political correctness, he's not doing more.
[02:48:33.353 --> 02:48:37.896]  We have to have people here legally, and we have to, you know, make sure they're not indoctrinated.
[02:48:37.896 --> 02:48:43.560]  We should probably stop all immigration until globalist indoctrination at the schools ends.
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:49.224]  Because they teach these people, you're here, have a chip on your shoulder, white people are the devil, hate them.
[02:48:49.224 --> 02:48:54.867]  American flags can't be seen in California, in the schools, the Ninth Circuit ruled they're racist.
[02:48:54.867 --> 02:48:55.548]  BS!
[02:48:55.548 --> 02:48:56.228]  It's got to stop.
[02:48:56.228 --> 02:48:57.889]  Thank you, Bob.
[02:48:57.889 --> 02:49:00.791]  Okay, let's go next to James in Colorado.
[02:49:00.791 --> 02:49:01.552]  James, thanks for holding.
[02:49:07.708 --> 02:49:09.369]  Hey, first time caller.
[02:49:09.369 --> 02:49:11.471]  I've been listening for about a year now.
[02:49:11.471 --> 02:49:13.052]  I listen to your app on a daily basis.
[02:49:13.052 --> 02:49:14.353]  Thank you.
[02:49:14.353 --> 02:49:18.676]  It's just amazing to me that the system is so against the president.
[02:49:18.676 --> 02:49:20.157]  I mean, it's obvious.
[02:49:20.157 --> 02:49:23.319]  And do you think he has a chance to actually make a difference?
[02:49:23.319 --> 02:49:25.921]  Just with executive orders, he got rid of the forced mandate.
[02:49:25.921 --> 02:49:28.543]  But the media won't report that the IRS says, OK, no $5,000 fine.
[02:49:30.626 --> 02:49:38.353]  I mean, it's amazing this is going on and there's countless other things he's done and the media just will not talk about it, will not debate it, will not discuss it.
[02:49:38.353 --> 02:49:41.436]  Yeah, I can't believe it.
[02:49:41.436 --> 02:49:42.096]  I just can't believe it.
[02:49:42.096 --> 02:49:47.421]  I look at it and I'm like, it's so rigged.
[02:49:47.421 --> 02:49:48.262]  It is absolutely rigged.
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:51.601]  Well, where do you think it's going from here?
[02:49:51.601 --> 02:49:55.243]  I mean, to me, it is an over-the-top historic battle.
[02:49:55.243 --> 02:50:04.427]  As Vice President Pence said, this is the most critical time in our movement to restore the Republic's history ever, because it is.
[02:50:04.427 --> 02:50:06.528]  It is the most critical time right now.
[02:50:06.528 --> 02:50:07.709]  This is history.
[02:50:07.709 --> 02:50:08.609]  Call C-SPAN.
[02:50:08.609 --> 02:50:09.730]  Call Talk Radio.
[02:50:09.730 --> 02:50:11.271]  Go to city council meetings.
[02:50:11.271 --> 02:50:12.611]  Just talk about freedom.
[02:50:12.611 --> 02:50:13.632]  Talk about sovereignty.
[02:50:14.432 --> 02:50:22.700]  Start out your discussion and they've got, you know, 50 illegals there with their local coyote controllers because they kind of like feed on them and control those folks that are illegal.
[02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:25.863]  And talk about Mexico has a fence on its southern border.
[02:50:25.863 --> 02:50:29.607]  Mexico puts you six months hard labor and tortures you if you're illegal.
[02:50:29.607 --> 02:50:30.508]  Here's the London Guardian.
[02:50:31.977 --> 02:50:32.818]  Then they're not going to blow up.
[02:50:32.818 --> 02:50:36.401]  You're going to say, yes, so can Mexico have this?
[02:50:36.401 --> 02:50:41.785]  And all Trump wants to do is deport people that are felons and folks that are newly trying to get in.
[02:50:41.785 --> 02:50:42.766]  Come on.
[02:50:42.766 --> 02:50:44.047]  You know this is all fraud.
[02:50:44.047 --> 02:50:46.009]  You're the ones promoting racism and just reach out.
[02:50:46.009 --> 02:50:51.113]  But it's usually white Soros controllers that are paying those people to be there.
[02:50:51.113 --> 02:50:51.674]  I've been there.
[02:50:51.674 --> 02:50:53.135]  I've seen the crowds.
[02:50:53.135 --> 02:50:55.697]  You actually talk to the immigrants from all over the world.
[02:50:55.697 --> 02:50:56.298]  You can wake them up.
[02:50:59.622 --> 02:51:02.203]  Guys, are you tired of being tired?
[02:51:02.203 --> 02:51:05.664]  Frustrated because it seems impossible to lose belly fat?
[02:51:05.664 --> 02:51:08.585]  If you're looking for a solution, then listen to Mark.
[02:51:08.585 --> 02:51:12.266]  I had fantastic results with the Andro 400 Max.
[02:51:12.266 --> 02:51:14.507]  Probably lost 35 pounds.
[02:51:14.507 --> 02:51:20.349]  And more impressive than that was the inches I lost off of my belly and my waist.
[02:51:20.349 --> 02:51:22.950]  And the increased energy is fantastic.
[02:51:22.950 --> 02:51:25.511]  I'll be totally honest, I tried a different product.
[02:51:26.112 --> 02:51:28.615]  And I wasn't happy with the different products.
[02:51:28.615 --> 02:51:31.818]  You guys are considerably cheaper than the other brand.
[02:51:31.818 --> 02:51:34.802]  And I can really feel the difference.
[02:51:34.802 --> 02:51:35.703]  Andro 400 Max.
[02:51:35.703 --> 02:51:38.747]  The extra strength, all natural testosterone booster.
[02:51:38.747 --> 02:51:43.853]  The safe, easy and affordable way to gain energy and lose stubborn belly fat.
[02:51:44.013 --> 02:51:46.756]  Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.

[02:53:15.942 --> 02:53:21.384]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:53:21.564 --> 02:53:31.552]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:53:31.552 --> 02:53:38.037]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:53:38.037 --> 02:53:41.360]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:43.422]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:53:43.422 --> 02:53:46.524]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:53:46.724 --> 02:53:49.905]  Some footage I shot on my iPhone of the most beautiful place I've ever been.
[02:54:16.613 --> 02:54:22.456]  Honole Bay.
[02:54:22.456 --> 02:54:24.376]  And that's where the elite are running.
[02:54:24.376 --> 02:54:27.338]  I had to go see it for myself and investigate old Zuckerberg.
[02:54:27.338 --> 02:54:31.140]  Got some stuff coming up on that soon.
[02:54:31.140 --> 02:54:33.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:34.601]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:54:34.601 --> 02:54:37.022]  David Knight's coming up.
[02:54:37.022 --> 02:54:40.084]  Got a little correction I'm going to make in the next segment.
[02:54:40.084 --> 02:54:43.525]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:54:43.525 --> 02:54:45.266]  Matthew in Ohio, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:54:47.503 --> 02:54:48.524]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:54:48.524 --> 02:54:48.924]  Good, brother.
[02:54:48.924 --> 02:54:51.346]  Thanks for calling.
[02:54:51.346 --> 02:54:52.447]  I'm a first-time caller, man.
[02:54:52.447 --> 02:54:54.348]  I just want to say I'm a big fan of yours, man.
[02:54:54.348 --> 02:54:56.810]  I, you know, stay informed.
[02:54:56.810 --> 02:54:58.731]  I have the InfoWars app.
[02:54:58.731 --> 02:55:02.874]  You know, I'm constantly just, you know, listening to you, watching you whenever I get a chance to.
[02:55:02.874 --> 02:55:04.655]  I'm just a huge fan.
[02:55:04.655 --> 02:55:09.419]  I even try to, you know, spread the word about your show to my family.
[02:55:09.419 --> 02:55:13.822]  I even had one cousin tell me he listened to your podcast with Joe Rogan.
[02:55:14.355 --> 02:55:19.998]  He said he listened to it all the way through, and he said that you're just a really smart man, and I appreciate you, man.
[02:55:19.998 --> 02:55:24.139]  You're just a hard worker, and I just really, truly appreciate you.
[02:55:24.139 --> 02:55:25.400]  Brother, understand this.
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:30.442]  As a man, I don't want to be a dominated and enslaved, and I'm also not out to get people.
[02:55:30.442 --> 02:55:31.703]  So people thank me.
[02:55:31.703 --> 02:55:33.644]  I'm just saying, this is what we all should be doing.
[02:55:33.644 --> 02:55:35.504]  So thank you for your support.
[02:55:35.504 --> 02:55:36.525]  Thank you for your prayers.
[02:55:36.525 --> 02:55:37.405]  I want to thank you.
[02:55:37.405 --> 02:55:38.486]  It's the average person.
[02:55:39.346 --> 02:55:39.807]  Right.
[02:55:39.807 --> 02:55:44.831]  And you know, the point I want to make is, you know, Trump is doing a great job, you know, with what he's given.
[02:55:44.831 --> 02:55:45.231]  You know, Obama
[02:56:03.294 --> 02:56:04.235]  We're good to go.
[02:56:32.785 --> 02:56:53.101]  And you know, um, like you said, we just gotta, you know, trust in God and, you know, just continue to pray because that's the only thing that we got is, you know, the power of prayer and God, you know, and each other, you know, lift each other up because what the media wants to do is they want to, you know, divide everybody and get everybody, you know, separated, you know, and they want to try to kill us off one by one until, you know, there's nobody left.
[02:56:53.101 --> 02:56:58.246]  But like you said, we just got to continue to, you know, fight and, you know, keep, you know, praying and trusting in God.
[02:56:58.246 --> 02:57:02.069]  My friend, I completely agree with you.
[02:57:03.220 --> 02:57:03.680]  God bless you.
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:06.881]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:57:06.881 --> 02:57:07.542]  Oh, no, that's it.
[02:57:07.542 --> 02:57:09.582]  I just appreciate, you know, you taking your time, man.
[02:57:09.582 --> 02:57:10.363]  I know you're busy.
[02:57:10.363 --> 02:57:12.623]  I know that... Brother!
[02:57:12.623 --> 02:57:15.985]  They're bringing in a system to end humanity as we know it.
[02:57:15.985 --> 02:57:18.526]  This is preservation of everything.
[02:57:18.526 --> 02:57:21.767]  It's like I knew if somebody was coming to kill my neighbor at midnight, I'd call the cops.
[02:57:21.767 --> 02:57:24.668]  If the cops didn't do anything, I'd be waiting there in the dark with a rifle.
[02:57:24.668 --> 02:57:25.868]  That's just normal, but thank you.
[02:57:25.868 --> 02:57:26.849]  God bless you.
[02:57:26.849 --> 02:57:28.129]  Debbie in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:57:28.129 --> 02:57:30.390]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:30.390 --> 02:57:31.710]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:31.710 --> 02:57:32.371]  Hey, thank you.
[02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:41.655]  Every federal building, state building, and court building has an admiralty flag with the rope around it.
[02:57:41.655 --> 02:57:44.216]  That's a UN wartime flag.
[02:57:44.216 --> 02:57:53.802]  And the courts follow the Constitution of the Corporation of the United States, and the attorneys take a pledge to the Corporation of the United States.
[02:57:53.802 --> 02:57:56.463]  Why are we not out of the UN yet?
[02:57:56.463 --> 02:58:02.507]  Well, Trump has legislation entered to do that, and is moving forward, saying that he's pulling us out of the whole thing right now.
[02:58:04.326 --> 02:58:09.432]  There's also um... But ma'am, that's why the power structure is against Trump.
[02:58:09.432 --> 02:58:10.753]  Right.
[02:58:10.753 --> 02:58:15.559]  But there's a thing also about how to beat criminal charges in an admiralty court because...
[02:58:16.841 --> 02:58:19.922]  They're not following our Constitution.
[02:58:19.922 --> 02:58:20.982]  Sure, sure.
[02:58:20.982 --> 02:58:22.342]  That's a very complex issue.
[02:58:22.342 --> 02:58:25.583]  There's a lot of people that do stuff pro se that actually make stuff up.
[02:58:25.583 --> 02:58:29.504]  But there is kernels of truth to what, you know, what folks are saying out there.
[02:58:29.504 --> 02:58:33.905]  And so there is kind of an admiralty administrative law that's replacing the code.
[02:58:33.905 --> 02:58:36.566]  And so what you say is on target.
[02:58:36.566 --> 02:58:37.326]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:37.326 --> 02:58:38.946]  We'll be right back with a special report.
[02:58:38.946 --> 02:58:39.826]  David Knight Moore.
[02:58:39.826 --> 02:58:41.167]  And I'm going to still do more time.
[02:58:41.167 --> 02:58:42.087]  So stay with us.
[02:58:42.087 --> 02:58:44.308]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:44.308 --> 02:58:45.008]  Spread that link.
[02:58:45.008 --> 02:58:46.008]  They're censoring the broadcast.
[02:58:49.648 --> 02:58:57.114]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:58:57.114 --> 02:59:10.323]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[02:59:23.159 --> 02:59:29.126]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[02:59:51.915 --> 02:59:54.556]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.338 --> 03:00:29.249]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[03:00:29.249 --> 03:00:32.091]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.091 --> 03:00:32.712]  Okay, folks.
[03:00:33.849 --> 03:00:37.271]  Final segment I'm hosting, and I have a special report coming up.
[03:00:37.271 --> 03:00:39.633]  The truth about Donald Trump and Satanism.
[03:00:39.633 --> 03:00:45.597]  While all these Satanists and others are attacking Donald Trump, I'm trying to jam in a call or two more here, too.
[03:00:45.597 --> 03:00:49.039]  Please remember this broadcast is under attack all over MSN.
[03:00:49.039 --> 03:00:51.621]  They just banned us from Google Ads via AdRoll.
[03:00:51.621 --> 03:00:53.202]  They're doing that to other outfits.
[03:00:53.202 --> 03:00:55.864]  Just a lot of pressure on the free independent press.
[03:00:55.864 --> 03:00:57.225]  You'll remember Joe Rogan.
[03:00:57.225 --> 03:01:03.109]  They didn't, for a day or so, put his podcast with me up on iTunes, and it turned out to be the most popular ever.
[03:01:03.929 --> 03:01:05.711]  And he saw other weird stuff like that go on.
[03:01:05.711 --> 03:01:09.735]  So there's massive manipulation and censorship intensifying.
[03:01:09.735 --> 03:01:12.137]  Google, Facebook, Twitter all admit this.
[03:01:12.137 --> 03:01:16.461]  The answer to this is to respond to it and say, no, don't do that.
[03:01:16.461 --> 03:01:20.204]  That's why I appreciate Joe Rogan so much because he's got one of the biggest podcasts.
[03:01:20.204 --> 03:01:21.285]  Longform is the longest.
[03:01:21.285 --> 03:01:24.688]  There's some that have more subscribers there and more viewers.
[03:01:24.688 --> 03:01:26.109]  They're like, you know, 10 minutes long.
[03:01:26.109 --> 03:01:28.151]  His is two and a half, three hours long on average.
[03:01:28.151 --> 03:01:29.793]  I did almost four hours with him about a month ago.
[03:01:30.433 --> 03:01:33.416]  And while I was there, I talked to one of my old friends afterwards at dinner.
[03:01:33.416 --> 03:01:40.723]  Joe was doing a show and he kind of reiterated, you know, that, oh, I think Joe got off conspiracies and stuff because he and his family got threatened, you know, the way he just got off of them.
[03:01:40.723 --> 03:01:44.226]  But, you know, Joe, because I was saying Joe knows more about all this stuff than I do.
[03:01:44.226 --> 03:01:45.307]  He was finishing my sentences.
[03:01:45.908 --> 03:01:46.888]  He remembers stuff I didn't remember.
[03:01:46.888 --> 03:01:49.169]  I mean, any topic I bring up, I'm not kissing Joe's ass.
[03:01:49.169 --> 03:01:51.610]  I've known Joe for, you know, 16, 17 years.
[03:01:51.610 --> 03:01:55.932]  I was really saying as a compliment, you know, that, man, you know, Joe knows more about this than I do.
[03:01:55.932 --> 03:01:57.432]  He can host the show better than me.
[03:01:57.432 --> 03:02:00.914]  I'm serious, because he's really good at explaining it and covering all the angles.
[03:02:00.914 --> 03:02:07.296]  That's why he's so good in movies and TV and, you know, UFC and one of the top comics, one of the top 10 comics in the country.
[03:02:08.317 --> 03:02:13.484]  So, I made that statement, turned it into some viral deal, like, Joe's scared, he's all this stuff.
[03:02:13.484 --> 03:02:22.596]  So then I got a little text from both Joe, but then later when I talked about it, Joe called him, I guess, I haven't talked to him yet, and said, hey, and I guess one night I was up here late,
[03:02:23.709 --> 03:02:25.851]  And I was saying, yeah, Joe and his family got threatened.
[03:02:25.851 --> 03:02:28.813]  So this is why Joe doesn't cover as much conspiracy stuff anymore.
[03:02:28.813 --> 03:02:30.214]  But boy, he sure knows a lot.
[03:02:30.214 --> 03:02:31.495]  He sure is smart.
[03:02:31.495 --> 03:02:32.695]  And it's just not true.
[03:02:32.695 --> 03:02:34.477]  It's not accurate.
[03:02:34.477 --> 03:02:39.480]  The way I heard it, I guess, late at night, you know, out eating dinner or whatever afterwards is I kind of got it mixed up.
[03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:42.903]  It was just that the person was speculating that maybe Joe got threatened.
[03:02:43.563 --> 03:02:46.927]  Uh, or, you know, because Joe stopped covering as many conspiracies as he used to.
[03:02:46.927 --> 03:02:50.231]  I think just the larger deal is it just becomes a distraction from what he was trying to do.
[03:02:50.231 --> 03:02:59.701]  But he had me on, he has a lot of other folks on, so there's no controversy there, and that is a correction, because the idea that Joe's scared of anybody and, you know, wouldn't report things because he's scared is pure bull.
[03:03:00.462 --> 03:03:10.430]  I said that in a larger context of other people getting threatened, me getting threatened, and the amount of intimidation and garbage that goes on that we know is happening.
[03:03:10.430 --> 03:03:14.353]  So there is my correction slash retraction.
[03:03:14.353 --> 03:03:15.474]  And Joe's not mad at me.
[03:03:15.474 --> 03:03:16.815]  It's not some big controversy.
[03:03:16.815 --> 03:03:19.017]  He just said, dude, you ever hear something like this?
[03:03:19.017 --> 03:03:20.138]  Call me.
[03:03:20.138 --> 03:03:23.521]  You know, this type of, you know what?
[03:03:23.521 --> 03:03:24.001]  Give me a call.
[03:03:24.001 --> 03:03:24.662]  What the hell is this?
[03:03:24.662 --> 03:03:27.804]  I was like, thought about it and went and clarified it.
[03:03:27.804 --> 03:03:28.285]  So there you go.
[03:03:29.565 --> 03:03:31.146]  You know, I got a bunch of callers here.
[03:03:31.146 --> 03:03:35.110]  I got AJ, I got Anna, I got Kimberly, I got Jim, I got Brian.
[03:03:35.110 --> 03:03:36.331]  We did first-time callers for a reason.
[03:03:36.331 --> 03:03:37.152]  They're always so good.
[03:03:37.152 --> 03:03:40.295]  I don't want to throw this on... I don't want to throw this on Knight.
[03:03:40.295 --> 03:03:42.437]  Hey, if he wants to take them, he can, but it's no big deal.
[03:03:42.437 --> 03:03:44.940]  If Knight wants to take them, he can.
[03:03:44.940 --> 03:03:46.341]  He's got a full plate, though, coming up.
[03:03:46.341 --> 03:03:48.002]  If he can't, I'll find out in the break.
[03:03:48.002 --> 03:03:49.524]  We'll let the callers know.
[03:03:49.524 --> 03:03:53.187]  And Nightly News is tonight, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:58.495]  Subscribers see it first in an HD and all my films and other special events.
[03:03:58.495 --> 03:04:01.500]  But yes, people say, why should I subscribe to PrisonPlanet.TV?
[03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:03.042]  You put it out on YouTube and Google everywhere else.
[03:04:03.042 --> 03:04:03.823]  Exactly.
[03:04:03.823 --> 03:04:07.028]  You help fund the seed to grow
[03:04:09.011 --> 03:04:10.372]  The movement to wake others up.
[03:04:10.372 --> 03:04:11.632]  We're a movement.
[03:04:11.632 --> 03:04:15.454]  You're the folks that care to pay and buy the products and support us.
[03:04:15.454 --> 03:04:17.636]  So the people that are new to it, hear it.
[03:04:17.636 --> 03:04:19.537]  Because they're not going to support it right up front.
[03:04:19.537 --> 03:04:21.538]  So thank you for making it all possible.
[03:04:21.538 --> 03:04:22.898]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:04:22.898 --> 03:04:24.800]  So become a presentplanet.tv member today.
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:26.861]  20 people can use each membership.
[03:04:26.861 --> 03:04:29.762]  We've got big specials that end tomorrow on all those products.
[03:04:29.762 --> 03:04:30.242]  Upwards of 50% off.
[03:04:32.064 --> 03:04:40.031]  Because we need to bring in capital because we've got a major loss now going into the new year for what we projected to be able to fund ourselves.
[03:04:40.031 --> 03:04:51.101]  3.3 million dollars at least already gone thanks to Google through ad rolls saying no you know you're a patriot we're gonna ban you because we're the tolerant open liberals you're fake news and then gave us no example of why.
[03:04:51.101 --> 03:04:53.623]  So thank you all for your support those specials in tomorrow.
[03:04:53.623 --> 03:04:56.566]  David Knight straight ahead but first the truth about Trump and Satanism.
[03:04:59.437 --> 03:05:05.384]  The United States foreign policy and engagement with Syria has been a disaster, and it may start and end with John McCain.
[03:05:05.384 --> 03:05:09.369]  Four years, McCain has been a buffer between the Middle East and the United States.
[03:05:09.369 --> 03:05:11.411]  McCain took a rare trip to Syria in 2013.
[03:05:11.411 --> 03:05:15.115]  He met with so-called moderate rebels Obama was bankrolling and arming.
[03:05:15.115 --> 03:05:18.259]  It turned out that these moderate rebels were the ones destabilizing the region.
[03:05:18.539 --> 03:05:20.120]  And could even be tied to ISIS.
[03:05:20.120 --> 03:05:26.945]  But of course, this would fit the foreign policy of the Obama administration and the Clinton State Department, which wanted Bashar Assad removed from power.
[03:05:26.945 --> 03:05:30.168]  Last week, McCain took another rare and secret trip to Syria.
[03:05:30.168 --> 03:05:33.090]  A spokesperson for McCain said he was there to visit with U.S.
[03:05:33.090 --> 03:05:35.832]  ground forces to discuss plans to defeat ISIL.
[03:05:35.832 --> 03:05:38.194]  ISIL, not ISIS, they were sure to clarify.
[03:05:38.194 --> 03:05:39.475]  Now, how coincidental,
[03:05:39.855 --> 03:05:44.298]  Upon McCain's return to the U.S., news stories everywhere are talking about more U.S.
[03:05:44.298 --> 03:05:46.079]  ground forces being sent to Syria.
[03:05:46.079 --> 03:05:50.021]  John McCain is a detriment to our nation, the Middle East, and peace on this planet.
[03:05:50.021 --> 03:05:56.405]  He needs to be removed from any unelected duties, and it is upon the people in the great state of Arizona to rid us of this warmonger.
[03:05:56.405 --> 03:05:58.446]  For InfoWars.com, I'm Owen Schroer.
[03:05:59.241 --> 03:06:02.504]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:02.504 --> 03:06:03.645]  They lost.
[03:06:03.645 --> 03:06:04.025]  We won.
[03:06:04.025 --> 03:06:07.328]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[03:06:07.328 --> 03:06:14.334]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:06:14.989 --> 03:06:20.731]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:06:20.731 --> 03:06:26.973]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:06:26.973 --> 03:06:33.255]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[03:06:33.255 --> 03:06:35.696]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:06:35.976 --> 03:06:37.157]  We're the solution!
[03:06:37.157 --> 03:06:38.157]  Americans!
[03:06:38.157 --> 03:06:39.678]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[03:06:39.678 --> 03:06:45.061]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:06:45.061 --> 03:06:46.762]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:06:46.762 --> 03:06:48.623]  DVDs now available.
[03:06:48.623 --> 03:06:52.065]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:06:52.065 --> 03:06:54.226]  Americans need to see this film.
[03:06:59.324 --> 03:07:01.625]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:07:01.625 --> 03:07:03.206]  It's like lightning in a bottle!

[03:07:15.030 --> 03:07:20.012]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:07:20.012 --> 03:07:25.474]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[03:07:25.814 --> 03:07:33.599]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[03:07:33.599 --> 03:07:38.322]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.

[03:07:47.327 --> 03:07:50.889]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[03:08:10.839 --> 03:08:15.726]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:08:15.726 --> 03:08:17.167]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.778 --> 03:08:35.403]  All across the country, at state capitals, at city town halls, leftists are openly coming out and chanting, Hail Satan!
[03:08:35.403 --> 03:08:37.344]  Abortion is our sacrament.
[03:08:37.344 --> 03:08:38.765]  We love Lucifer.
[03:08:38.765 --> 03:08:40.166]  And down with Donald Trump.
[03:08:40.166 --> 03:08:41.447]  And it gets worse.
[03:08:41.447 --> 03:08:52.233]  They're now announcing on national television that the public should join hands in ritual magic against Donald Trump to bring him down.
[03:08:52.233 --> 03:08:53.834]  I hope that you mind, pretty.
[03:08:53.834 --> 03:08:55.435]  And your little dog, too.
[03:09:11.818 --> 03:09:17.882]  I don't want to ever hear again from the corporate mainstream media that there's no occult connections to the left.
[03:09:17.882 --> 03:09:35.253]  Or that, you know, there's no bizarre rituals taking place when it's all over TV, all over Hollywood, all over rock and roll, all over hip-hop, all over the news, calling for everyone to focus psychically with Satan or Lucifer to kill Trump tonight.
[03:09:35.253 --> 03:09:40.256]  And then you go to town halls of the Texas Capitol and people are saying, hail Lucifer, hail Satan.
[03:09:40.936 --> 03:09:47.338]  And they've just adopted this satanic culture whether you believe there's a real devil or not.
[03:09:47.338 --> 03:09:59.921]  These people fundamentally hate progress and success because they're a bunch of arrested development losers that have been taught it's cool to not excel and to be a loser.
[03:09:59.921 --> 03:10:06.202]  And they wouldn't last five minutes in Sudan or Somalia without being killed or kidnapped or raped.
[03:10:06.202 --> 03:10:08.823]  And they're just like, bring this in as fast as you can
[03:10:09.403 --> 03:10:15.846]  Because they're one with the radical Islamic spirit of Wahhabism, that if you look at it, is satanic!
[03:10:15.846 --> 03:10:24.629]  Having little kids kill people, cutting people's throats, having prisoners you're about to kill eat human flesh, so you send them to hell according to the Quran.
[03:10:24.629 --> 03:10:26.670]  This is all admitted!
[03:10:26.670 --> 03:10:35.834]  And again, they're praising Satan, they're praising Lucifer, they're calling for the death of Trump, they're outraged at the mainstream media that Trump is invoking the birthright of God.
[03:10:36.812 --> 03:10:42.239]  And calling God back into our world to have some truly, you know, positive outlooks.
[03:10:42.239 --> 03:10:54.115]  Whether you believe in God or not, if you had some beautiful, you know, tree in your house and you worshipped life and wanted to build something good and be a wholesome person, you could say that was positive outlook.
[03:10:54.736 --> 03:11:23.537]  But if you're worshipping the devil that's about greed, and dysfunction, and destruction, and willful rebellion against our natural order that's so fulfilling and so good, and attacking men and women, and the family, and the holy union of the man and woman, and trying to ban those terms, and National Geographic not having a single normal, normal, yes, classic mammal, female, on the cover, shows you it's a true attack on the fortress of our strength, women.
[03:11:24.332 --> 03:11:26.355]  That's why they claim they love women.
[03:11:26.355 --> 03:11:29.279]  Because they want to keep their enemies closer.
[03:11:29.279 --> 03:11:33.305]  They want to destroy the archetype of the goddess.
[03:11:33.305 --> 03:11:35.509]  These are truly satanic people.
[03:11:49.560 --> 03:11:56.983]  So at the CPAC speech and at his inauguration a month and a half ago, President Trump says, hey, it's okay to say Jesus Christ.
[03:11:56.983 --> 03:12:00.665]  It's okay to say that, you know, God has been part of the founding of this nation.
[03:12:00.665 --> 03:12:02.766]  It's okay to ask God for providence.
[03:12:02.766 --> 03:12:06.628]  It's okay to want to be positive and productive and optimistic.
[03:12:07.631 --> 03:12:23.035]  And by the way, America has been captured and hijacked by globalist interests that have set up deals to conquer us financially and politically while transferring our power to third world dictatorships they control to then exploit those populations.
[03:12:23.035 --> 03:12:32.338]  And they howl and they scream with hate and say, you're anti-gay, you're anti-this, you're anti-that, when none of it's even true.
[03:12:32.338 --> 03:12:35.359]  Because the truth is, Trump is inclusive.
[03:12:36.465 --> 03:12:41.606]  The globalists and their minions just want to get rid of our sovereignty and say we don't have a right to have a country.
[03:12:41.606 --> 03:12:55.450]  So that's why they're attacking Trump, because they want to create borderless systems with a bunch of dispossessed, alone, disenfranchised, dumbed-down people, like a modern Tower of Babel, fighting with each other.
[03:12:56.030 --> 03:13:02.713]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[03:13:02.713 --> 03:13:11.697]  The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[03:13:11.697 --> 03:13:20.041]  We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
[03:13:21.522 --> 03:13:27.647]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[03:13:27.647 --> 03:13:30.910]  So let's go over some of these headlines that are at InfoWars.com right now.
[03:13:30.910 --> 03:13:32.492]  Links to mainstream news.
[03:13:32.492 --> 03:13:37.616]  Witches around the world plot mass spell against Trump.
[03:13:37.616 --> 03:13:40.318]  And the news is reporting it like it's completely normal.
[03:13:40.318 --> 03:13:45.223]  Tonight, by the light of the waning moon, witches will cast a binding spell on Donald Trump.
[03:13:46.988 --> 03:13:48.449]  It's like a ghost dance.
[03:13:48.449 --> 03:13:58.172]  But the Native Americans were very, very pure with their ghost dance, not knowing why their world was collapsing, so they just went and said, join with our ancestors, send us back in time, we don't know what to do.
[03:13:58.172 --> 03:14:03.714]  That was a loving ritual from the research I've done.
[03:14:03.714 --> 03:14:08.036]  Surprised God didn't really hear that call, because some bad things were done to those people.
[03:14:09.119 --> 03:14:22.173]  You are calling for black magic and Donald Trump's death, and I was reading here, for the demons of the abyss to come out of hell and destroy Trump.
[03:14:22.173 --> 03:14:23.435]  Here's another one.
[03:14:23.435 --> 03:14:26.798]  Lana Del Rey joins efforts to defeat Trump with witchcraft.
[03:14:26.798 --> 03:14:27.780]  Rolling Stone.
[03:14:29.215 --> 03:14:32.197]  Witchcraft to hex Trump's populist battle cry.
[03:14:32.197 --> 03:14:33.558]  That's the video we broke down.
[03:14:33.558 --> 03:14:36.180]  And you got the Pope saying he's disgusted.
[03:14:36.180 --> 03:14:39.222]  It makes him sick in his stomach when he hears about Europe having Christian roots.
[03:14:39.222 --> 03:14:41.443]  It can't even have Christian roots now!
[03:14:41.443 --> 03:14:47.307]  Truly a satanic Pope as well, to be a cherry on top to this little event we're witnessing.
[03:14:47.307 --> 03:14:54.452]  But this isn't just viral posts on Facebook, pushed by Hollywood stars and music stars, that, you know, got picked up.
[03:14:54.452 --> 03:14:56.274]  This is happening at the town halls.
[03:14:57.116 --> 03:15:02.077]  All over the country that the controlled corporate fake stream media is pushing people to go out to.
[03:15:02.077 --> 03:15:11.520]  And at these, if the towns dare have an opening prayer, protesters freak out, yell Lucifer after GOP town hall opens with a prayer.
[03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:16.941]  And you watch the video, it's like something out of the Bible where they're like, no, not prayer, oh, Lucifer.
[03:15:16.941 --> 03:15:19.202]  I mean, this is like, are they gonna turn into frogs or something?
[03:15:36.844 --> 03:15:48.386]  This is crazy, and then of course you have what's happened in Texas, where they're having a pro-life event trying to pass a ban on partial birth abortions, and people show up and start saying, hail Satan, hail Satan.
[03:15:49.861 --> 03:15:50.461]  How many did I adopt?
[03:15:50.461 --> 03:15:50.901]  I kill my kids!
[03:15:50.901 --> 03:15:51.261]  I kill my kids!
[03:16:14.557 --> 03:16:20.178]  This is the definition of modern, liberal, pop satanism that we see all over the culture.
[03:16:20.178 --> 03:16:26.320]  A bunch of self-centered people that say, I'll go in your girl's bathroom when I'm a 6'4 man.
[03:16:44.844 --> 03:16:59.208]  We'll let three men, identifying as women, come over and assault and get in the face of our reporter at a public march, at a public event, and bully her until she deletes the footage off our tape, as happened last night, to Millie Weaver.
[03:16:59.208 --> 03:17:03.589]  We'll do whatever we want, because we'll do as we will.
[03:17:03.589 --> 03:17:06.070]  Do as thou wilt, it's the whole law, Alistair Crowley.
[03:17:06.070 --> 03:17:08.931]  And we're going to dominate you and we're going to control you, and what it really is,
[03:17:10.157 --> 03:17:19.601]  Is a bunch of spoiled toddlers throwing giant fits, going after everyone and trying to bully them in a gang mentality.
[03:17:19.601 --> 03:17:31.866]  So it's basically hordes of betas who are now deciding in huge swarms to become alphas, but a real alpha would try to build people up and be honorable and strong.
[03:17:31.866 --> 03:17:33.007]  Instead, they want to destroy.
[03:17:33.007 --> 03:17:37.829]  In the video I'm talking about, there's one large man, probably 6'3",
[03:17:40.111 --> 03:17:41.452]  I just don't know how tall Millie is.
[03:17:41.452 --> 03:17:42.993]  Wearing a wig, identifying as a woman.
[03:17:42.993 --> 03:17:44.374]  Fine, I don't care.
[03:17:44.374 --> 03:17:49.537]  Coming over and kind of getting in her face that Millie's so charming, he says, fine, marry me.
[03:17:49.537 --> 03:17:50.997]  And that guy's funny!
[03:17:50.997 --> 03:17:53.699]  And I don't care if he's out there wearing a wig, dancing around, having fun.
[03:17:53.699 --> 03:17:54.399]  Fine!
[03:17:54.399 --> 03:17:56.401]  I'm not judging him.
[03:17:56.401 --> 03:17:59.262]  But they wouldn't even come give her intellectual arguments.
[03:17:59.262 --> 03:18:01.564]  They just cussed and yelled and screamed at her.
[03:18:01.564 --> 03:18:08.488]  And only one person actually came over to her and was somewhat funny and made a joke out of it.
[03:18:09.036 --> 03:18:11.518]  Because she was being nice.
[03:18:11.518 --> 03:18:17.743]  And they're screaming how Donald Trump's helped to get gay people when he's been an advocate for equal rights for 30 years before it was cool.
[03:18:17.743 --> 03:18:19.365]  But they don't care.
[03:18:19.365 --> 03:18:20.185]  It's not about that.
[03:18:20.185 --> 03:18:20.586]  It's about...
[03:18:21.513 --> 03:18:41.150]  Just like Christians can become very, very orthodox and very, very oppressive and have been in history in kind of gangs, controlling behavior, being kind of puritanical as a system of control, the left claimed they were all about open societies, but was captured by the children and grandchildren of people that were uptight, anal-retentive people before.
[03:18:42.264 --> 03:18:43.965]  That's why they're not punk rock.
[03:18:43.965 --> 03:18:45.326]  They're not avant-garde.
[03:18:45.326 --> 03:18:46.267]  They're not cutting edge.
[03:18:46.267 --> 03:18:47.588]  They're not counterculture.
[03:18:47.588 --> 03:18:48.649]  They're the opposite.
[03:18:48.649 --> 03:18:57.956]  And that's why the left is wetting itself to the most radical orthodox forms of oppressive Islam that rapes women en masse in Sweden and Germany and the Netherlands.
[03:18:57.956 --> 03:19:00.918]  And their government admittedly is ordered to cover it up.
[03:19:00.918 --> 03:19:06.863]  And as mobs of men rape women in big crowds of people, nothing is done because the religion
[03:19:07.877 --> 03:19:20.168]  Is you must submit, you must give over your culture, you must be passive if you're an alpha to the giant mass of betas who are coming to rape and enslave you.
[03:19:20.168 --> 03:19:23.051]  Finally, in closing, study history and the facts for yourself.
[03:19:23.051 --> 03:19:26.954]  It's unequivocal.
[03:19:26.954 --> 03:19:33.420]  No country, no nation, no culture can survive when it involves itself in black magic, the dark arts.
[03:19:34.867 --> 03:19:41.114]  Even if you don't believe the Christian cosmology, Asia and their histories understand this as well.
[03:19:41.114 --> 03:19:50.623]  When you tune into the dark side, it'll give you limited quick power up front, but will destroy you and everyone around you in the process.
[03:19:50.623 --> 03:19:55.829]  And as a culture in massive decline, the so-called leftist or the left-hand path,
[03:19:57.008 --> 03:20:10.694]  The sinister hand is openly invoking Satanism and Luciferianism in America, just as they did during the French Revolution that killed close to a million people.
[03:20:10.694 --> 03:20:23.460]  The reason our enemies are so crazed is they understand they're dialed into something very dark, very old, very twisted, and only powerful against those that don't know what they're facing.
[03:20:27.063 --> 03:20:28.987]  We're good to go.
[03:20:40.697 --> 03:20:44.439]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, February 27, 2017.
[03:20:44.439 --> 03:20:45.160]  I'm David Knight.
[03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:52.204]  As you heard, the melting mascot of the Globalist crying out there with the water dumped on her.
[03:20:52.204 --> 03:20:53.805]  Look, folks, we're winning.
[03:20:53.805 --> 03:20:59.389]  And one of the signs that we're winning is something that's just happened in New Hampshire.
[03:20:59.389 --> 03:21:01.190]  We just had New Hampshire gun owners
[03:21:02.472 --> 03:21:06.213]  Have the governor there sign a bill for constitutional carry.
[03:21:06.213 --> 03:21:07.674]  And this is what I've said before.
[03:21:07.674 --> 03:21:14.476]  With Donald Trump, we need somebody at the national level to fight off the globalists.
[03:21:14.476 --> 03:21:19.197]  But we have to take responsibility at the local level to get back our freedoms.
[03:21:19.197 --> 03:21:21.938]  And that's exactly what they've done here in New Hampshire.
[03:21:21.938 --> 03:21:22.758]  You haven't heard about this.
[03:21:22.758 --> 03:21:24.739]  This happened nearly a week ago.
[03:21:24.739 --> 03:21:26.039]  It was last Wednesday.
[03:21:26.039 --> 03:21:28.140]  We had the Republican governor there, Chris Sununu,
[03:21:29.202 --> 03:21:40.306]  He'd be the son, I guess, of John Sununu, signed into a law that says this, quote, it allows a person to carry a loaded concealed pistol or revolver without a license.
[03:21:40.306 --> 03:21:47.108]  It's not a privilege, it's a right, folks, unless such person is otherwise prohibited by the New Hampshire statutes.
[03:21:47.108 --> 03:21:55.151]  Okay, so in other words, you have a right to protect yourself, and you only get that right removed when you do something criminal.
[03:21:55.984 --> 03:22:05.609]  Just like you have a right to move about freely and they put you in prison if they convict you of something in a day of court, they can take away your gun rights as well if you do something that is criminal.
[03:22:05.609 --> 03:22:16.376]  But you should not be judged to be irresponsible, which is what gun control does in the first place, to say that we're going to treat this as a privilege and we'll grant it to you as if you were children.
[03:22:17.296 --> 03:22:20.978]  And we're not going to presume that you're innocent and worthy of self-defense.
[03:22:20.978 --> 03:22:32.484]  And they point out this bill ensures New Hampshire citizens are guaranteed the fundamental right to carry a firearm in defense of themselves and their families as prescribed by Article 2A of our state constitution.
[03:22:32.484 --> 03:22:33.385]  That's what the governor said.
[03:22:34.145 --> 03:22:37.568]  And of course, his Democrat predecessor had vetoed the bill.
[03:22:37.568 --> 03:22:39.890]  This is an article from MRCTV.
[03:22:39.890 --> 03:22:48.938]  They say this makes New Hampshire the 12th state that doesn't generally require a license or a permit to carry a concealed weapon.
[03:22:48.938 --> 03:22:50.400]  This is how it happens.
[03:22:50.400 --> 03:22:56.846]  We have to have somebody fighting off the globalists, making sure that we still have a country, that we still have a constitution,
[03:22:57.691 --> 03:23:02.396]  But they don't pay attention to the Constitution, whether it's the state constitution or the federal constitution.
[03:23:02.396 --> 03:23:04.798]  We are going to have to work at the local level.
[03:23:04.798 --> 03:23:06.540]  This is a good example of how that is done.
[03:23:06.540 --> 03:23:20.594]  Meanwhile, while you've got the people in New Hampshire, and that's not an area even though they have a lot of freedom in terms of carrying guns and a lot of other freedoms, you don't see them burning the place down in the streets like we just saw in Switzerland.
[03:23:21.348 --> 03:23:23.429]  Switzerland used to be that kind of place, didn't it?
[03:23:23.429 --> 03:23:24.329]  But what's happening there?
[03:23:24.329 --> 03:23:31.590]  We've got the leftists, we've got the refugees coming in, and now you see violence erupting in the streets of Switzerland.
[03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:32.951]  Burned Switzerland, no less.
[03:23:32.951 --> 03:23:33.931]  This is from RT.
[03:23:33.931 --> 03:23:38.212]  They say several hundred people gathered in an unauthorized protest and burn over the weekend.
[03:23:38.212 --> 03:23:43.113]  This descended into violence as hooded youth set cars on fire.
[03:23:43.113 --> 03:23:44.173]  Police used tear gas.
[03:23:44.173 --> 03:23:46.314]  They deployed water cannons to disperse the crowd.
[03:23:47.139 --> 03:23:52.305]  And the president of the police union there in Bern said this is a war on the police.
[03:23:52.305 --> 03:23:59.293]  Do you understand this is the same tactic that George Soros and Black Lives Matter has been setting up here in America?
[03:23:59.293 --> 03:24:03.719]  This is a global movement and it is a movement by the leftists.
[03:24:03.719 --> 03:24:06.802]  They use surrogates to do this and they also have
[03:24:07.423 --> 03:24:08.544]  Planned this.
[03:24:08.544 --> 03:24:11.425]  The police union president said, this is tragic.
[03:24:11.425 --> 03:24:14.227]  I doubt demonstrators are worried about politics.
[03:24:14.227 --> 03:24:16.188]  They wage war against the police.
[03:24:16.188 --> 03:24:17.368]  This is new for Byrne.
[03:24:17.368 --> 03:24:18.789]  Yes, it is.
[03:24:18.789 --> 03:24:21.150]  This is the new globalist plan.
[03:24:21.150 --> 03:24:23.272]  They have the same plan for all of us.
[03:24:23.272 --> 03:24:34.818]  Part of that plan is opening up the borders, bringing in people who don't want to assimilate, bringing them in in large enough numbers that you guarantee that they won't have to assimilate, creating leftists who are going to
[03:24:35.845 --> 03:24:36.305]  We're good to go.
[03:24:54.520 --> 03:25:07.070]  And when they get into the streets, when they blockade the streets, when they attack people's homes, their businesses, their automobiles, when they create a safety issue by blocking the street, that is not protest.
[03:25:07.070 --> 03:25:08.551]  That is not a speech.
[03:25:08.551 --> 03:25:10.713]  That is simply a violent riot.
[03:25:10.713 --> 03:25:12.294]  We have to call it that.
[03:25:12.294 --> 03:25:16.918]  And yet, it's interesting, because last week, as I pointed out on Friday, there was an article from The Hill.
[03:25:17.970 --> 03:25:26.055]  And the headline on the article was that there were numerous bills being proposed throughout the United States that would shut down free speech.
[03:25:26.055 --> 03:25:29.337]  And then they talked about the people who were blockading roads and so forth.
[03:25:29.337 --> 03:25:34.500]  And I've been talking about this for, I guess it's been about six weeks ago, I put up a
[03:25:35.558 --> 03:25:41.122]  I did a poll on my Twitter account, Libertarian, and we had about 11,000 people take that poll.
[03:25:41.122 --> 03:25:47.746]  About 10% of the people thought that it was a free speech issue to block the streets and to get violent with people.
[03:25:47.746 --> 03:25:51.489]  But the other 90% understood what that was about.
[03:25:51.489 --> 03:25:54.751]  This is not about free speech.
[03:25:54.751 --> 03:25:56.933]  We have to understand what free speech is and what it isn't.
[03:25:56.933 --> 03:26:00.115]  We're going to talk about here in just a moment, George W. Bush.
[03:26:00.925 --> 03:26:09.471]  Trump has come out of retirement to criticize Donald Trump and one of the things that he does is twist the meaning of free speech.
[03:26:09.471 --> 03:26:12.894]  So we need to understand what free speech is and what it isn't.
[03:26:12.894 --> 03:26:15.095]  It doesn't give you a right to riot.
[03:26:15.095 --> 03:26:17.057]  It is not a right to riot.
[03:26:17.057 --> 03:26:19.359]  It is not a right to set fire to the theater.
[03:26:19.359 --> 03:26:23.462]  You don't even have a right to yell fire in a crowded theater when there is no fire.
[03:26:23.462 --> 03:26:26.344]  You certainly don't have a right to set fire to the theater.
[03:26:27.409 --> 03:26:36.193]  And even in that article, the headline, it says, Republicans across the country are working to create laws against free speech.
[03:26:36.193 --> 03:26:38.174]  And then if you read the first paragraph, what does it say?
[03:26:38.174 --> 03:26:40.255]  It says, well, the rioters, blah, blah, blah.
[03:26:40.255 --> 03:26:41.876]  They understand themselves that it's a riot.
[03:26:43.876 --> 03:26:45.257]  Darren McBrain did a great piece.
[03:26:45.257 --> 03:26:47.117]  He said, this is a protest.
[03:26:47.117 --> 03:26:52.339]  This is somebody talking about issues, holding up signs, arguing with people.
[03:26:52.339 --> 03:26:53.599]  This is a protest.
[03:26:53.599 --> 03:27:02.342]  This over here is a riot, folks, when they start throwing stuff at people, when they start smashing windows, smashing cars, setting fires, when they start getting in your face.
[03:27:02.342 --> 03:27:05.463]  Your freedom ends at the edge of my noshing.
[03:27:05.463 --> 03:27:10.185]  Swing your fist all you want to, as they say, but when you start hitting me, it's no longer free speech.
[03:27:10.185 --> 03:27:11.125]  It's been a riot.
[03:27:12.022 --> 03:27:14.602]  And we have to understand that is a key difference.
[03:27:14.602 --> 03:27:20.324]  But also look at the fact that here in Switzerland, we've got the same thing happening that we have here.
[03:27:20.324 --> 03:27:31.926]  Interestingly enough, we've got a Swedish billionaire, you know, the place where they want to pretend they don't have any of these problems with the mass migration that they brought into Sweden, the people replacement that is going on there.
[03:27:31.926 --> 03:27:33.446]  And now we have a Swedish billionaire.
[03:27:33.446 --> 03:27:37.627]  Interestingly enough, this guy comes from Hungary, just like George Soros.
[03:27:37.627 --> 03:27:38.447]  He fled Hungary
[03:27:39.227 --> 03:27:44.975]  He started playing the financial markets, became a multi-multi-billionaire, and now he's pushing globalism.
[03:27:44.975 --> 03:27:46.416]  Well, that rhymes too, doesn't it?
[03:27:46.416 --> 03:27:49.541]  We keep seeing the same template everywhere.
[03:27:49.541 --> 03:27:51.563]  These riots, these Hungarian...
[03:27:53.112 --> 03:27:55.093]  Billionaires who played the stock market.
[03:27:55.093 --> 03:27:56.455]  Now here's one from Sweden.
[03:27:56.455 --> 03:28:01.940]  He's going to award five million dollars to people so they can reimagine global governance.
[03:28:01.940 --> 03:28:04.402]  Because their plans are not working.
[03:28:04.402 --> 03:28:06.324]  Because we've exposed their plans.
[03:28:06.324 --> 03:28:08.666]  We've shown you what their plans are.
[03:28:08.666 --> 03:28:10.067]  We've told you.
[03:28:10.067 --> 03:28:14.011]  Just like Zbigniew Brzezinski created the Trilateral Commission.
[03:28:15.149 --> 03:28:21.293]  And that was essentially manifest in the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[03:28:21.293 --> 03:28:24.935]  That was a manifestation of what he had planned.
[03:28:24.935 --> 03:28:33.141]  To basically create the world around three different financial centers that would then become political centers that would then unify into a world government.
[03:28:33.141 --> 03:28:35.102]  And we said this is the direction that they're going.
[03:28:36.147 --> 03:28:39.949]  And that plan was busted, and it was now shut down by Donald Trump.
[03:28:39.949 --> 03:28:43.491]  And we're going to see other nationalist governments coming together.
[03:28:43.491 --> 03:28:45.552]  Of course, a part of it was the European Union.
[03:28:45.552 --> 03:28:47.813]  That is now itself unraveling.
[03:28:47.813 --> 03:28:50.635]  So the Swedish billionaire says, wait, this just isn't working.
[03:28:50.635 --> 03:28:53.176]  We've got to come up with a better rationale for this.
[03:28:53.176 --> 03:28:58.259]  And of course, part of the key rationale for world government has always been climate change.
[03:28:58.259 --> 03:29:00.380]  And that's one of the things that he's calling for.
[03:29:00.380 --> 03:29:03.662]  He's saying, let's figure out how we can use climate change.
[03:29:03.662 --> 03:29:04.562]  Well, one of the good news
[03:29:05.703 --> 03:29:11.266]  He says they came out today as Donald Trump is looking at what he's going to do with the budget.
[03:29:11.266 --> 03:29:15.147]  One of the things that he's going to do, of course, he's going to increase military spending.
[03:29:15.147 --> 03:29:16.908]  I'm not necessarily on board with that.
[03:29:16.908 --> 03:29:21.290]  I'll say that I'm not on board with it because I think that we need to do more with what we've got.
[03:29:21.290 --> 03:29:28.993]  If we continue to expand the welfare warfare state, we're not going to be able to handle this by reforming things around the edges.
[03:29:28.993 --> 03:29:32.095]  But of course, the first thing they need to do, just like the first people that need to be
[03:29:32.775 --> 03:29:35.338]  Taken out of this country that are here illegally are the gang members.
[03:29:35.338 --> 03:29:35.758]  Well, you know what?
[03:29:35.758 --> 03:29:40.422]  The gang members that they've got to shut down are the gang members in Washington, the bureaucracies.
[03:29:40.422 --> 03:29:42.404]  And we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[03:29:42.404 --> 03:29:50.011]  But of course, key on the chopping block is the climate change agenda, because that's part of the globalist agenda for world government.
[03:29:50.011 --> 03:29:50.411]  Stay with us.
[03:29:50.411 --> 03:29:50.952]  Be right back.
[03:29:59.682 --> 03:30:05.586]  A measuring stick for decorum in Congress is approaching, as President Trump is set to deliver his first address to Congress.
[03:30:05.586 --> 03:30:18.074]  In an event classified by its dignity and demeanor, the presidential address will certainly be shadowed by the Democrat trolls, who are planning on bringing guests such as Muslim Americans and Dreamers, in a sad attempt to tug at the heartstrings of America's electorate.
[03:30:18.314 --> 03:30:20.756]  And in an attempt to cast Trump as the bad guy.
[03:30:20.756 --> 03:30:31.183]  So instead of concern for their constituents in the states and counties that they represent, they're out casting nets in a search effort to find political pawns they can use against Trump in the psychological battle of optics.
[03:30:31.183 --> 03:30:39.729]  This is also an opportunity for Trump to, again, sound the sirens of nationalism against globalism, and America First policies that will bring jobs back to America.
[03:30:39.729 --> 03:30:44.793]  InfoWars will have live coverage of Trump's address to Congress, with the nightly news starting tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[03:30:44.793 --> 03:30:47.575]  Central, then rolling right into live coverage of Trump's address.
[03:30:47.975 --> 03:30:53.238]  Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said the theme of Trump's address will be the renewal of the American spirit.
[03:30:53.238 --> 03:30:56.340]  Of course, the never-Trump Democrats would try to deter that.
[03:30:56.340 --> 03:30:59.221]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:30:59.221 --> 03:31:04.024]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[03:31:59.631 --> 03:32:01.212]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:32:01.212 --> 03:32:06.133]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:32:06.133 --> 03:32:09.655]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:32:09.655 --> 03:32:15.477]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:32:15.477 --> 03:32:21.179]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:32:21.599 --> 03:32:24.562]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:32:24.562 --> 03:32:30.128]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:32:30.128 --> 03:32:37.155]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:32:37.155 --> 03:32:41.720]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.

[03:33:10.971 --> 03:33:16.714]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.714 --> 03:33:22.257]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.257 --> 03:33:24.998]  I'm David Knight, your host for this fourth hour.
[03:33:24.998 --> 03:33:39.065]  We're going to go back to this Swedish billionaire who's going to be offering five million dollars for people to come up with some new way to sell global governance to us, because what they're selling us nobody is buying.
[03:33:39.932 --> 03:33:42.033]  And they're really circling the wagons, folks.
[03:33:42.033 --> 03:33:54.582]  They're trying to come up with different ways to control this, and one of the things that they've been planning for some time, and they're going through with, even though they lost this election, and that is to move against the free press.
[03:33:54.582 --> 03:33:57.163]  And I'm not talking about CNN and the Washington Post.
[03:33:57.163 --> 03:34:04.048]  They're squealing very loudly about the fact that they're not getting their monopoly recognized, that they established.
[03:34:04.835 --> 03:34:14.840]  And we're going to talk about George W. Bush siding with them, essentially, against Donald Trump, essentially flying the flag that he's always been part of.
[03:34:14.840 --> 03:34:18.302]  He's always been part of the globalists, but he flies it a little bit more clearly right now.
[03:34:18.302 --> 03:34:21.204]  We're going to talk about that in just a moment, but you can see the fact
[03:34:22.091 --> 03:34:26.713]  They're altering their techniques, they're doubling down on where they were going.
[03:34:26.713 --> 03:34:30.815]  One of the aspects of that is to censor our ads.
[03:34:30.815 --> 03:34:41.180]  They couldn't organize a sponsor boycott of us because we sell our own products and we do it on a non-political site that serves non-political ads.
[03:34:42.240 --> 03:34:45.062]  Has things like Silver Bullet and Supermail Vitality.
[03:34:45.062 --> 03:34:48.724]  And so what they did was they said, well, we're not going to allow you to put those ads out there.
[03:34:48.724 --> 03:34:54.768]  So last Wednesday we did a 13-hour live broadcast to make sure that people understood that.
[03:34:54.768 --> 03:35:05.636]  And at Infowarsstore.com, our non-political site, you will find these specials that we have now continued to extend from that program, that 13-hour broadcast we did last Wednesday.
[03:35:05.636 --> 03:35:09.458]  It was a major hit on us financially, and we appreciate you standing with us.
[03:35:09.458 --> 03:35:10.239]  Many of you have.
[03:35:10.839 --> 03:35:12.240]  And we hope that you will stand with us.
[03:35:12.240 --> 03:35:15.082]  We stand with you in terms of products that we put out there.
[03:35:15.082 --> 03:35:15.723]  We're capitalists.
[03:35:15.723 --> 03:35:17.564]  We don't want to just ask you for donations.
[03:35:17.564 --> 03:35:22.687]  We do appreciate people who do donate and we did have that as part of that broadcast.
[03:35:22.687 --> 03:35:24.369]  But we also want to help you.
[03:35:25.629 --> 03:35:33.936]  To protect your health and that of your family, and to have a more productive, more energetic life, so that you can stand with us against this.
[03:35:33.936 --> 03:35:39.440]  And so we appreciate you standing with us financially, and we want to help you stand against them physically.
[03:35:39.440 --> 03:35:42.382]  And so we have a lot of supplements that we put out as part of this sale.
[03:35:42.382 --> 03:35:44.204]  A Silver Bullet colloidal silver, 33% off stock price.
[03:35:45.985 --> 03:35:48.248]  Super Male Vitality, 25% off.
[03:35:48.248 --> 03:35:50.490]  Brain Force, 25% off.
[03:35:50.490 --> 03:35:54.014]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, 25% off.
[03:35:54.014 --> 03:36:02.763]  Caveman, our new supplement that has bone broth and it's got turmeric root, a lot of different things that are part of the
[03:36:03.464 --> 03:36:04.364]  Paleo diet.
[03:36:04.364 --> 03:36:07.966]  Also we have still our lithographs of Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan.
[03:36:07.966 --> 03:36:12.608]  These are the lithographs that were commissioned by the RNC official portrait artist.
[03:36:12.608 --> 03:36:14.289]  You've seen the one of Ronald Reagan before.
[03:36:14.289 --> 03:36:16.390]  They're on very, very high quality paper.
[03:36:16.390 --> 03:36:17.591]  A limited edition of that.
[03:36:17.591 --> 03:36:20.212]  And also a free Alexa Pure.
[03:36:20.212 --> 03:36:23.253]  If you get three months InfoWars select storable food supplies.
[03:36:23.253 --> 03:36:25.254]  We've offered you a lot of specials there.
[03:36:25.254 --> 03:36:29.857]  That's what we're going to continue to do so that we can continue this fight against the globalists.
[03:36:29.857 --> 03:36:31.917]  And as I said, they're losing.
[03:36:31.917 --> 03:36:32.398]  So we've got this
[03:36:33.078 --> 03:36:34.019]  Billionaire.
[03:36:34.019 --> 03:36:36.501]  Offering 5 million dollars.
[03:36:36.501 --> 03:36:40.584]  This is a Global Challenges Prize 2017.
[03:36:40.584 --> 03:36:42.285]  A new shape, is what he's saying.
[03:36:42.285 --> 03:36:43.966]  Yeah, they're trying to sell us.
[03:36:43.966 --> 03:36:47.989]  It's the same old crap that they're trying to put in a new box, okay?
[03:36:47.989 --> 03:36:49.611]  A new bag of crap.
[03:36:49.611 --> 03:36:57.516]  He's calling on individuals, groups of individuals, universities, companies, associations from everywhere in the world to submit proposals outlining an alternative world government model.
[03:36:58.317 --> 03:37:02.319]  Because their model stinks, like the pile of crap that it is.
[03:37:02.319 --> 03:37:08.961]  Either by revising the present UN system, or by proposing completely new forms of government.
[03:37:08.961 --> 03:37:13.703]  And we need to focus on pressing global problems.
[03:37:13.703 --> 03:37:18.104]  And the first one he mentions, of course, is climate change, and other things like population growth.
[03:37:18.104 --> 03:37:21.966]  That's why we need to have the government telling us how many kids we can have.
[03:37:22.446 --> 03:37:32.629]  The government funding abortions and then telling us that the world is going to melt down if we have a one degree change in temperature and they don't even have the data, the baseline data to measure that against.
[03:37:32.629 --> 03:37:37.270]  They don't have the ability to make those kind of fine term measurements.
[03:37:37.270 --> 03:37:40.051]  But of course they're going to tell us that we have to do something.
[03:37:40.051 --> 03:37:43.632]  It's a global problem and we have to fight it globally.
[03:37:43.632 --> 03:37:45.413]  We have to fund that fight globally.
[03:37:45.413 --> 03:37:49.094]  We have to therefore have a global government to do that.
[03:37:50.307 --> 03:37:51.587]  See how that works?
[03:37:51.587 --> 03:37:55.989]  You create an imaginary problem, then you create the global solution to that imaginary problem.
[03:37:55.989 --> 03:37:59.170]  So now he's offering people money because they just aren't getting there.
[03:37:59.170 --> 03:38:02.971]  Meanwhile, we see Marine Le Pen surging in the polls.
[03:38:02.971 --> 03:38:09.033]  27% of voters say they're backing her, and then we have her closest rival at 25%.
[03:38:09.033 --> 03:38:13.294]  Most of, this is even their polls, the same people who in France said, oh look,
[03:38:14.053 --> 03:38:15.974]  We're going to have the Russians hacking our election.
[03:38:15.974 --> 03:38:17.094]  All this stuff is the same.
[03:38:17.094 --> 03:38:17.654]  Don't you see this?
[03:38:17.654 --> 03:38:25.037]  How they've got the same lefty, progressive leftist rioting in Sweden, I'm sorry, Switzerland now.
[03:38:25.037 --> 03:38:29.759]  Just as you've got a Swedish billionaire trying to tell us that we have to have world governance.
[03:38:29.759 --> 03:38:33.901]  A Swedish billionaire from Hungary who made his money in the stock market.
[03:38:33.901 --> 03:38:35.081]  I mean, it just doesn't change.
[03:38:35.081 --> 03:38:39.423]  It's the same people over and over again with the same types of strategies.
[03:38:40.165 --> 03:38:45.908]  And they point out the polls have shown that Le Pen is likely to win in the first round but lose in the second.
[03:38:45.908 --> 03:38:46.768]  Well, we'll see about that.
[03:38:46.768 --> 03:38:50.150]  These are the same people that told us Donald Trump could not possibly win.
[03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:56.954]  I think they're going to have a surprise coming because she is right at the center of the zeitgeist.
[03:38:56.954 --> 03:38:58.195]  She understands what's going on.
[03:38:58.195 --> 03:39:01.436]  Let's talk about Bush 43.
[03:39:01.436 --> 03:39:04.138]  George W. Bush, or as I like to call him, Shrub.
[03:39:05.114 --> 03:39:08.204]  Trump came out and attacked Trump's travel ban.
[03:39:08.204 --> 03:39:09.648]  He was interviewed on NBC.
[03:39:10.976 --> 03:39:16.399]  Of course, there used to be this tradition that the presidents went quietly into retirement.
[03:39:16.399 --> 03:39:19.880]  They didn't really talk about much, and they didn't criticize the incumbent.
[03:39:19.880 --> 03:39:25.643]  They did everything they could to avoid that, but that's not what's happening anymore, because these people are really desperate.
[03:39:25.643 --> 03:39:39.410]  Just like the Swedish billionaire is going to offer millions for people to come up with a new way to sell this, we've now got Trump, as well as Obama, out there openly opposing Donald Trump, because he's not part of their globalist establishment.
[03:39:40.455 --> 03:39:46.336]  You know, I just have to say to Shrub, no, we don't miss you yet.
[03:39:46.336 --> 03:39:48.056]  And I don't think we're going to miss you.
[03:39:48.056 --> 03:40:08.180]  When you fly your flag to show us even more clearly where you, where your loyalties lie, as we see in this NBC, this is on Monday, Today Show, Shrub comes out and says, they ask him about Trump's executive order halting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
[03:40:08.180 --> 03:40:08.840]  And what does he say?
[03:40:09.588 --> 03:40:14.990]  He said, well, the bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely.
[03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:16.971]  Think about that for a moment.
[03:40:16.971 --> 03:40:21.153]  What he's doing here is he shifts this, a very clever pivot.
[03:40:21.153 --> 03:40:31.178]  You may say that George is not very smart, but somebody told him what to say, or he figured out himself, because this is a very sly pivot that he does here.
[03:40:32.059 --> 03:40:40.247]  What he does is he says, when they talk about Muslims coming here, what he is putting forth to you is a right of immigration.
[03:40:40.247 --> 03:40:47.513]  But he sells it to you as our First Amendment right to the freedom of free exercise of religion.
[03:40:48.194 --> 03:40:49.634]  You understand?
[03:40:49.634 --> 03:40:51.235]  That's how he's putting it out here.
[03:40:51.235 --> 03:40:55.436]  He says to Matt Lauer, he says, well, we have a right to worship freely.
[03:40:55.436 --> 03:41:02.517]  He says, I think it's very important for us all to recognize one of our great strengths is for people to be able to worship the way they want to or not worship at all.
[03:41:02.517 --> 03:41:06.298]  The bedrock of our freedom and a bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely.
[03:41:06.298 --> 03:41:11.680]  He says this in response to a question about people coming here from Muslim countries.
[03:41:11.680 --> 03:41:12.000]  And so, W
[03:41:14.252 --> 03:41:28.945]  is telling us that Trump's ban on people coming from a predominantly Muslim country that we're currently at war with, that we're bombing, these are people that Barack Obama bombed and yet we're supposed to let them in here without any vetting.
[03:41:28.945 --> 03:41:30.966]  And George W. Bush tells us, well,
[03:41:31.732 --> 03:41:36.958]  We have a right to worship freely, so we should let these people come in.
[03:41:36.958 --> 03:41:40.621]  See, he makes it about religion, very carefully, and he pivots it into that.
[03:41:40.621 --> 03:41:41.342]  He twists that.
[03:41:41.342 --> 03:41:45.386]  It's a very clever, very devious twist that he's got there.
[03:41:45.386 --> 03:41:49.871]  He says, I'm all for an immigration policy that is welcoming and upholds the law.
[03:41:50.752 --> 03:41:55.453]  Oh, so then I guess he would not be in favor of foreign citizens who are here illegally?
[03:41:55.453 --> 03:41:57.173]  Who thumb their nose at the law?
[03:41:57.173 --> 03:41:57.674]  Oh no, no.
[03:41:57.674 --> 03:41:59.294]  He would be all for that, actually.
[03:41:59.294 --> 03:42:05.075]  And actually, what he would like to do is, with people like Paul Ryan, he would like to make that perfectly legal.
[03:42:05.075 --> 03:42:05.755]  Perfectly legal.
[03:42:05.755 --> 03:42:15.157]  You know, I talked about it on Friday, briefly, the fact that we have, I think the amount was one or two billion dollars.
[03:42:15.157 --> 03:42:16.538]  I don't have the article here on my desk.
[03:42:16.538 --> 03:42:17.498]  One or two billion dollars.
[03:42:18.558 --> 03:42:31.427]  That they found going to people out of the Social Security program as welfare payments, not as retirement payments, but as welfare payments, and the majority of that was going to people who didn't even have Social Security numbers.
[03:42:32.244 --> 03:42:37.668]  Because we have taken the position that you don't have to be a citizen to come here.
[03:42:37.668 --> 03:42:39.829]  You can come here illegally if you're a child.
[03:42:39.829 --> 03:42:44.873]  You can come here and then your parents can come in after you.
[03:42:44.873 --> 03:42:48.816]  So you don't even, you can be an anchor baby if you're part of the DACA program.
[03:42:48.816 --> 03:42:51.558]  You don't even have to be born here in the United States.
[03:42:51.558 --> 03:42:54.700]  You can just come here as a minor and now you're an anchor baby.
[03:42:54.700 --> 03:42:55.721]  See how they've expanded that?
[03:42:56.630 --> 03:43:02.474]  First, they came up with, they invented the right of becoming a citizen even though your parents were not Americans.
[03:43:02.474 --> 03:43:07.537]  You could come here and if you're born on American soil, they said, well, you're going to be automatically an acrobat.
[03:43:07.537 --> 03:43:08.938]  No, we need to push back against that.
[03:43:08.938 --> 03:43:12.241]  That's not what the Constitution is about at all.
[03:43:12.241 --> 03:43:13.341]  It's not about that.
[03:43:13.341 --> 03:43:15.042]  I don't know of any other country that does that.
[03:43:15.042 --> 03:43:17.544]  Maybe some other countries do, but it's not right.
[03:43:17.544 --> 03:43:22.708]  But now they've extended it to the point where if you come here under a certain age,
[03:43:23.669 --> 03:43:32.837]  Then we're going to afford you all the benefits of the welfare state and you can bring in your extended family and they can enjoy the benefits of the extended welfare state as well.
[03:43:32.837 --> 03:43:39.984]  And then you look at people who say, well, hey, it's only a couple billion dollars and we can't balance the budget just by cutting a couple billion dollars.
[03:43:39.984 --> 03:43:45.489]  No, but you can certainly destroy your budget one lunch at a time.
[03:43:45.489 --> 03:43:46.750]  You know, when I look at people saying,
[03:43:47.819 --> 03:44:00.382]  It's only one or two billion dollar expenditure here, and that's not going to be enough to do something about the massive deficit that we have here and the mounting debt each year, the cumulative deficits.
[03:44:00.382 --> 03:44:07.324]  It's kind of like, on a personal level, if you decide that you are entitled to go to Starbucks each day and have a five dollar coffee.
[03:44:08.089 --> 03:44:11.252]  And then you're entitled to have lunch out every day as well.
[03:44:11.252 --> 03:44:22.763]  And pretty soon, you don't realize it, but you don't have any money for the big-ticket items because your money has just been twittered away on these repetitive expenditures that are all, in and of themselves, pretty small.
[03:44:23.735 --> 03:44:26.036]  And that's what we're seeing with these people in Washington.
[03:44:26.036 --> 03:44:31.979]  They're saying, well, leave NPR alone or leave this group alone because that really doesn't matter too much.
[03:44:31.979 --> 03:44:38.922]  That will only save us about one hour of federal spending if we take that entire program out.
[03:44:38.922 --> 03:44:43.084]  Well, that's the way you balance the budget, is one of those things at a time.
[03:44:43.084 --> 03:44:45.005]  That's the way you balance your personal budget.
[03:44:45.005 --> 03:44:47.847]  And if you have that kind of sense of entitlement,
[03:44:48.649 --> 03:44:50.871]  For your Starbucks coffee, you're going to go bankrupt.
[03:44:50.871 --> 03:44:56.015]  You have to, at some point, look at what you can afford, create a budget, and stick to that.
[03:44:56.015 --> 03:44:59.357]  And if you don't, you're going to go bankrupt as an individual, you're going to go bankrupt as a country.
[03:44:59.357 --> 03:45:09.505]  But I want to go back to Bush here, because not only did he do this real sinister spin on saying, well, Trump's travel ban, no, no, no, this is all about religion, he says.
[03:45:09.505 --> 03:45:12.888]  And so he turns this into a right to immigrate.
[03:45:12.888 --> 03:45:15.830]  There is no right to immigrate in the Constitution.
[03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:16.371]  There's a right
[03:45:18.712 --> 03:45:25.937]  Where was W to speak out when people were having their free exercise trampled on by Obamacare?
[03:45:25.937 --> 03:45:28.638]  Did he get involved in that fight against Obama?
[03:45:28.638 --> 03:45:29.439]  No!
[03:45:29.439 --> 03:45:31.220]  He was totally silent.
[03:45:31.220 --> 03:45:38.525]  He really couldn't care less if there was a mandate on the little sisters of the poor.
[03:45:39.850 --> 03:45:48.839]  Celibate nuns who are not married, and they're taking care of elderly poor people, and they're told that against their conscience they have to fund birth control and abortion through Obamacare.
[03:45:48.839 --> 03:45:50.500]  They had to go to the Supreme Court to fight it.
[03:45:50.500 --> 03:45:53.824]  Where was George W. Bush on all that?
[03:45:53.824 --> 03:45:55.485]  Well, he was probably sitting in his bathtub.
[03:45:56.286 --> 03:46:00.587]  Painting pictures of his feet as we saw from Guccifer when he hacked his email.
[03:46:00.587 --> 03:46:16.652]  So he needs to go back and do that because if you're going to come out of retirement and you're going to speak against Donald Trump on the travel ban and try to twist that into saying that there's some kind of a right to immigration because we have a First Amendment free exercise of speech, what hypocrisy from Trump.
[03:46:16.652 --> 03:46:18.352]  But then he does something else.
[03:46:18.352 --> 03:46:20.793]  He takes a side of the media against Trump as well.
[03:46:21.829 --> 03:46:25.734]  He says the media is essential to democracy.
[03:46:25.734 --> 03:46:27.096]  No, not really.
[03:46:27.096 --> 03:46:33.043]  There's nothing about the media, there's nothing about CNN or the Washington Post and the Constitution.
[03:46:33.854 --> 03:46:45.457]  No, it says we have a right to free speech, but it doesn't say that the professional press, or that the elite of the professional press, have a right to a monopoly to cover the White House.
[03:46:45.457 --> 03:46:46.858]  See, that's what they're upset about.
[03:46:46.858 --> 03:46:59.061]  They're upset about the fact that they have this sense of entitlement, and they think that they're the only ones who should be allowed to cover the President, and that they are entitled to do this regardless of how they spend the information, regardless of how they lie.
[03:47:00.467 --> 03:47:03.370]  And what Trump is doing is pushing back against this.
[03:47:03.370 --> 03:47:14.001]  But George W. Bush on Monday goes on NBC and says the media is an essential component to democracy, arguing it is necessary to hold the government accountable.
[03:47:14.001 --> 03:47:16.043]  Well, who holds the media accountable?
[03:47:16.724 --> 03:47:20.209]  See, I think Trump has free speech as well.
[03:47:20.209 --> 03:47:21.731]  He has a right to speak back as well.
[03:47:21.731 --> 03:47:32.867]  But when he criticizes the press, especially when he criticizes people who do their job in a very poor, very partisan way, like CNN and Washington Post, everybody cries, First Amendment!
[03:47:32.867 --> 03:47:33.588]  First Amendment!
[03:47:35.015 --> 03:47:36.876]  No, it's not about that.
[03:47:36.876 --> 03:47:41.679]  He said, and he goes on to point out, that he thinks the problem is totally Trump.
[03:47:41.679 --> 03:47:44.620]  He says, power can be very addictive.
[03:47:44.620 --> 03:47:47.622]  Well, you want to see an example of power being addictive?
[03:47:47.622 --> 03:47:49.503]  Take a look at the mainstream media.
[03:47:49.503 --> 03:47:51.944]  Or even go back and take a look at George Bush himself.
[03:47:51.944 --> 03:47:54.746]  He said, Dwight, just remember when he said, I wish I could be
[03:47:55.922 --> 03:48:01.789]  Like the Chinese, and just sign these orders and make everybody do what I want them to do.
[03:48:01.789 --> 03:48:08.978]  That's really where his heart is, and of course he's now flown his flag yet again to tell us that he is with the globalists.
[03:48:08.978 --> 03:48:14.624]  I want to take a look at another article that was on the Drudge Report today that I thought was very, very concerning.
[03:48:15.612 --> 03:48:16.993]  We really need to wake up, folks.
[03:48:16.993 --> 03:48:18.734]  We need to wake up to what's going on here.
[03:48:18.734 --> 03:48:21.576]  This is off of Zero Hedge via Drudge.
[03:48:21.576 --> 03:48:23.157]  Welcome aboard, but first the U.S.
[03:48:23.157 --> 03:48:25.479]  Marshals will scan your retina.
[03:48:25.479 --> 03:48:27.760]  And they're going into the airport.
[03:48:27.760 --> 03:48:32.364]  This is somebody talking about how they were flying from Mexico, to Mexico, from Atlanta.
[03:48:33.516 --> 03:48:40.217]  And as they're getting on, walking down the jet bridge, they said, there's a new layer of security.
[03:48:40.217 --> 03:48:41.037]  Two U.S.
[03:48:41.037 --> 03:48:49.059]  Marshals, heavily armed, dressed in dystopian style black regalia, stood next to an upright machine with a glowing green eye.
[03:48:49.059 --> 03:48:54.900]  Every passenger, one by one, was told to step on a mat and look into the green scanner.
[03:48:54.900 --> 03:49:00.901]  It was scanning our eyes and matching that scan with the passport, which was also scanned yet again.
[03:49:00.901 --> 03:49:02.261]  You understand what's going on here, folks?
[03:49:03.214 --> 03:49:08.795]  At one level, they could say, well, we're looking to see if any terrorists are leaving our country to go to Mexico.
[03:49:08.795 --> 03:49:11.076]  That was one thing I guess you could say.
[03:49:11.076 --> 03:49:13.636]  But let's understand what's really going on here.
[03:49:13.636 --> 03:49:16.337]  What's really going on here is they're creating a database.
[03:49:16.337 --> 03:49:20.558]  They're matching your identity, where they've got all that information about you and your passport.
[03:49:20.558 --> 03:49:25.659]  They're now matching that and creating a biometric profile of you as well.
[03:49:25.659 --> 03:49:31.020]  When, American people, are you going to wake up to this and say, we're not going to go down this road?
[03:49:32.011 --> 03:49:34.612]  This is very, very troubling.
[03:49:34.612 --> 03:49:40.914]  At the beginning of this article, the person who wrote it says, for some 15 years, they've seen airport security become steadily more invasive.
[03:49:40.914 --> 03:49:56.059]  You know, I had a friend of mine in engineering who went to the Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., and his comment was, he said, you know, I realized when I went there that the history of flight in the 20th century was really a history of engine development.
[03:49:56.059 --> 03:49:59.700]  More than anything, it was about the development of more and more powerful engines.
[03:50:01.069 --> 03:50:14.255]  And I've thought about that over the years, and over the last 15 years I've got to say that the history of flight in the 21st century has become a shameful history of surveillance.
[03:50:14.255 --> 03:50:18.377]  And the surveillance state is becoming the engine of tyranny, folks.
[03:50:18.377 --> 03:50:19.798]  You have to understand the TSA
[03:50:20.885 --> 03:50:23.247]  Doesn't see themselves as being limited to airports.
[03:50:23.247 --> 03:50:28.191]  They're hitting us right now because people spend a lot of money to fly on a plane.
[03:50:28.191 --> 03:50:33.715]  And they're reluctant, no matter what these people do, just as he's saying right here, do I throw away my ticket that I've paid a lot of money for?
[03:50:33.715 --> 03:50:43.784]  I've made a lot of plans, I've got other things that are dependent on this, do I just throw that away because these people are going to put me in a biometric database, or I can throw away a couple hundred dollars that I've spent on an airline ticket?
[03:50:43.784 --> 03:50:47.867]  Most people look at that and no matter how uncomfortable they are, they will descend into this tyranny.
[03:50:47.867 --> 03:50:49.468]  We've got to say, that's enough.
[03:50:49.468 --> 03:50:50.369]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:50:59.494 --> 03:51:07.596]  What if ExtendoVite really works, but you find that hard to believe, and you spend precious time looking for someone to say, just try it.
[03:51:07.596 --> 03:51:15.457]  I have my health today because of ExtendoVite, and if I did not take a leap of faith and try it, well, I would be on disability today.
[03:51:15.457 --> 03:51:20.258]  Take one bottle of ExtendoVite, as suggested, for 60 days to find out for yourself.
[03:51:20.258 --> 03:51:22.659]  No need to stop any other meds you may be on.
[03:51:22.659 --> 03:51:24.919]  You know by now that they are not working for you.
[03:51:25.259 --> 03:51:32.044]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Xtendivite working for you and will want to take another bottle.
[03:51:32.044 --> 03:51:33.165]  Life is too short!
[03:51:33.165 --> 03:51:35.126]  Get your Xtendivite today!
[03:51:35.126 --> 03:51:40.590]  Xtendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2-month supply.

[03:51:57.577 --> 03:52:00.598]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[03:52:00.598 --> 03:52:03.859]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[03:52:03.859 --> 03:52:05.399]  The world is in turmoil.
[03:52:05.399 --> 03:52:09.921]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[03:52:09.921 --> 03:52:13.042]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[03:52:13.042 --> 03:52:16.703]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[03:52:17.003 --> 03:52:21.425]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[03:52:21.425 --> 03:52:24.306]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[03:52:24.306 --> 03:52:28.007]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[03:52:28.007 --> 03:52:30.528]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[03:52:30.528 --> 03:52:34.130]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[03:52:34.130 --> 03:52:39.292]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat, and it lasts up to 25 years.
[03:52:39.292 --> 03:52:41.352]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[03:52:41.352 --> 03:52:45.414]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.
[03:52:45.734 --> 03:52:48.277]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-763-5999.

[03:52:52.363 --> 03:52:54.205]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[03:53:03.337 --> 03:53:05.298]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[03:53:05.298 --> 03:53:07.359]  Find your happiness with Pure Soap.

[03:54:10.885 --> 03:54:12.266]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:12.266 --> 03:54:16.890]  I'm David Knight and we've got a very special model joining us in the studio right now.
[03:54:16.890 --> 03:54:21.213]  He is modeling our new Trump is my President shirt, Alex Jones.
[03:54:21.213 --> 03:54:22.294]  Well, thank you.
[03:54:22.294 --> 03:54:23.916]  We didn't pre-script this.
[03:54:23.916 --> 03:54:32.843]  I was just thinking about this and so I thought I'd come in here live on air and discuss it some and talk about it some with David Knight because it's so important.
[03:54:32.843 --> 03:54:36.986]  This is the limited edition Trump is my President shirt we put out a month before
[03:54:38.067 --> 03:54:38.507]  Even one.
[03:54:54.875 --> 03:54:56.236]  Because it hit me a few weeks ago.
[03:54:56.236 --> 03:55:02.623]  Trump, I knew, was going to do more rallies around the country to energize the base and fight the Democrats in Soros who are trying to cause a civil war.
[03:55:02.623 --> 03:55:04.385]  He's got to keep the base fired up to win.
[03:55:04.385 --> 03:55:08.529]  You know, get our agenda through of cutting taxes, securing the border, sovereignty, basic stuff like that.
[03:55:08.529 --> 03:55:10.812]  And I thought of a Pence
[03:55:13.426 --> 03:55:16.028]  Trump ticket, you know, Trump-Pence ticket 2020.
[03:55:16.028 --> 03:55:29.677]  So I thought let's have a t-shirt that is Trump-Pence 2020 to just put out the idea that hey, we're looking into the future of restoring this Republic and the shirt says Keeping America Great.
[03:55:29.677 --> 03:55:42.826]  So on the front it says Trump-Pence 2020 Keeping America Great and on the back it says America first since 1776 Infowars.com and that way you go to the big Trump rallies
[03:55:43.926 --> 03:55:46.908]  And you're able to meet other Infowarriors.
[03:55:46.908 --> 03:55:51.830]  You're also able to, you know, force the media to understand that Infowarriors is the dominant force.
[03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:58.493]  You're able to continue in front of the Trump inner circle, not just Trump himself, to, you know, keep the flag of Infowarriors up there.
[03:55:58.493 --> 03:56:09.277]  And you're also able to, on the street, not just at these events, meet friends and others that you would never have known who are basically fellow travelers, to use their communist term, so that we show solidarity.
[03:56:09.277 --> 03:56:10.218]  But here's what's most important.
[03:56:11.667 --> 03:56:26.475]  We've come up with this Trump 2020 idea so that we can get back in the face of those that want to bully us and tell us that we can't wear our Make America Great hats out, that we can't wear our InfoWars shirts out, or they're going to come over and get in our face or be bullies.
[03:56:26.475 --> 03:56:27.215]  Good.
[03:56:27.215 --> 03:56:31.718]  We're the American people, very race, color, and creed, the human race, that want liberty and freedom in our time.
[03:56:32.398 --> 03:56:39.446]  And so that's why we're doing this, that's why we're promoting this, and we're going to hit the streets, the city council meetings, the state house meetings, unanimously.
[03:56:39.446 --> 03:56:45.592]  They praise their God Lucifer, we're going to praise our God Jehovah, our God Yahweh, and his son Jesus Christ.
[03:56:45.592 --> 03:56:46.933]  And so it comes down to this, folks.
[03:56:47.864 --> 03:56:49.566]  We have this new shirt.
[03:56:49.566 --> 03:56:50.427]  It's $9.95.
[03:56:50.427 --> 03:56:51.208]  Made in America.
[03:56:51.208 --> 03:56:52.009]  Printed in America.
[03:56:52.009 --> 03:56:52.029]  $9.95.
[03:56:52.029 --> 03:56:57.495]  And by the time we ship it to you and the rest of it, we really don't even make much profit on that.
[03:56:57.495 --> 03:56:59.758]  But it also helps fund the operation a little bit.
[03:56:59.758 --> 03:57:01.880]  But it spreads the word, more importantly.
[03:57:01.880 --> 03:57:04.583]  And so when the shirt officially comes out, we need some funding.
[03:57:04.583 --> 03:57:04.984]  It's going to be $19.95.
[03:57:06.846 --> 03:57:09.768]  But for everybody that pre-orders it now, it's being printed right now.
[03:57:09.768 --> 03:57:10.988]  It'll be shipping the next week to us.
[03:57:10.988 --> 03:57:12.369]  We'll start shipping it out to you.
[03:57:12.369 --> 03:57:14.790]  For those that order it now, it's $9.95.
[03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:17.191]  We never discount a shirt out of the gates.
[03:57:17.191 --> 03:57:23.135]  Then it'll go back to $19.95, so we, you know, make $12-13 bucks on it, which we need to fund the operation.
[03:57:23.135 --> 03:57:24.135]  Nothing wrong with that.
[03:57:24.135 --> 03:57:24.995]  You're voting with your dollars.
[03:57:24.995 --> 03:57:26.336]  So please support us.
[03:57:26.336 --> 03:57:27.657]  Pre-order the shirt today.
[03:57:27.657 --> 03:57:29.478]  I believe this is going to be the next shirt.
[03:57:30.038 --> 03:57:38.500]  Just like Hillary for prison 2016, or just like the rape shirt, or just like Trump is my president shirt was so dominant and at all the rallies.
[03:57:38.500 --> 03:57:41.960]  We'll have a new version of Trump is my president as well coming out very soon.
[03:57:41.960 --> 03:57:43.261]  But this is the big shirt.
[03:57:43.261 --> 03:57:44.881]  I believe this is the big shirt.
[03:57:44.881 --> 03:57:46.701]  I knew the other shirt would be the big shirt.
[03:57:46.701 --> 03:57:47.401]  It was.
[03:57:47.401 --> 03:57:50.802]  Please make this the big shirt in solidarity.
[03:57:50.802 --> 03:57:51.402]  In solidarity.
[03:57:51.402 --> 03:57:52.182]  I'm kind of toothache today.
[03:57:52.182 --> 03:57:52.342]  Sorry.
[03:57:52.342 --> 03:57:53.743]  It's just that I've got all the work done.
[03:57:53.743 --> 03:57:54.663]  In solidarity.
[03:57:56.423 --> 03:57:58.103]  I had a mobile dentist come here just a minute ago, folks.
[03:57:58.103 --> 03:57:59.584]  I'm sorry, a little bit mumbly.
[03:57:59.584 --> 03:58:01.764]  Again, Trump Dance 2020.

[03:58:06.865 --> 03:58:11.226]  I especially like America First since 1776 because of the left.
[03:58:11.226 --> 03:58:16.127]  I just saw today the Guardian saying, hey, America First, that was a Nazi slogan before World War II.
[03:58:16.127 --> 03:58:20.848]  No, it was Adams who said, we don't go abroad seeking monsters to destroy.
[03:58:20.848 --> 03:58:22.128]  That's what has been
[03:58:22.748 --> 03:58:25.909]  The essence of America for a long time, and that's right there on the TV.
[03:58:25.909 --> 03:58:30.271]  Glenn Beck said we should do... Glenn Beck said saying nationalism is evil and bad.
[03:58:30.271 --> 03:58:31.611]  You don't have a country then!
[03:58:31.611 --> 03:58:32.392]  That's right, that's right.
