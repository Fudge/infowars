[00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:06.838]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:00:06.838 --> 00:00:10.161]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread!
[00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:14.084]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:16.146]  We're beholden to scum!
[00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:17.767]  Russian scum!
[00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:18.828]  Listen.
[00:00:18.828 --> 00:00:26.514]  Please listen.
[00:00:26.514 --> 00:00:28.116]  If you don't, if you won't,
[00:00:29.147 --> 00:00:34.789]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.950]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.951]  Sleep.
[00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:42.892]  Sleep.
[00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:43.292]  Sleep.
[00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:44.592]  Oh my God!
[00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:45.193]  Oh my God!
[00:00:45.193 --> 00:00:45.773]  Oh my God!
[00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:46.553]  Lock the door!
[00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:47.033]  Lock the door!
[00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:47.954]  They're coming!
[00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:49.094]  They're coming!
[00:00:49.094 --> 00:00:49.814]  Help!
[00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:50.535]  Help!
[00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:51.475]  They're coming!
[00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:52.195]  They're coming!
[00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:53.155]  Listen to me!
[00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:53.536]  Listen!
[00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:53.836]  Help me!
[00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:56.805]  Please!
[00:00:56.805 --> 00:00:58.346]  Your legs are in danger!
[00:00:58.346 --> 00:00:59.427]  Please, listen to me!
[00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:00.608]  Something terrible!
[00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:01.308]  Please!
[00:01:01.308 --> 00:01:03.290]  Your legs are in the air!
[00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.592]  They're already here!
[00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:05.792]  Help!
[00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:06.152]  Your legs!
[00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:06.673]  They're coming!
[00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:08.114]  They're coming!
[00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:08.954]  Sleep.
[00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:10.075]  The seed is planted.
[00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:12.037]  Sleep.
[00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:12.978]  Sleep.
[00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:14.319]  Terror grows.
[00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:15.119]  Sleep.
[00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.360]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.902]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[00:01:17.902 --> 00:01:19.583]  Sit up!
[00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:21.745]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:25.419]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.681]  Is it contagious?
[00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:29.842]  It looked right at me.
[00:01:29.842 --> 00:01:30.822]  You need to get out!
[00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:32.583]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:35.144]  We're not human.
[00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:38.526]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:40.928]  We're being cornered!
[00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:43.989]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:46.751]  We're barricading the street.
[00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:48.852]  Invasion of the body searchers.
[00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:15.519]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.261]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide broadcast today.
[00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:38.403]  That's a powerful piece that Darren McBreen put together, paralleling science fiction nightmares of dystopian alien takeovers with zombified
[00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:42.204]  When we come back in the next segment, I have
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.964]  Figured out exactly what they're doing.
[00:03:07.964 --> 00:03:16.619]  In fact, beyond that I have gone and dug into their own policy papers and confirmed that
[00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:38.676]  They have decided at least three months ago when President Trump won the election to claim that he's an outside Russian force and that anyone supporting him is and actually direct the bureaucracies of the government outside of the executive in open mutiny and rebellion to build in a soft coup civil war towards a physical one.
[00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:39.797]  They are intending.
[00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.222]  To overthrow the president one way or another.
[00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:48.404]  They aren't intending to politically persecute those of us that have been trying to defend the country.
[00:03:48.404 --> 00:03:52.327]  The globalists are here and they've actually declared their plans.
[00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:57.869]  They are the outside globalist force alien to this republic.
[00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:03.012]  And just as dangerous as any sci-fi nightmare that the human mind can conjure.
[00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:10.396]  Because the same human minds that can conjure nightmares can also build real nightmares on this planet when groups of psychopaths and
[00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:15.203]  Sociopaths get together.
[00:04:15.203 --> 00:04:29.313]  But the headline today on the live feed at Infowars.com, Ford's last show, and on many other platforms is Obama planned to take over the internet and talk radio and shut down free speech.
[00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:32.355]  It's still in place and they're still moving forward with it.
[00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:37.458]  Now, I knew this months ago and I was surmising that, but I knew it was bold.
[00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:41.161]  It's definite now they have announced it in their own councils of government.
[00:04:42.045 --> 00:04:44.466]  These are rogue agencies.
[00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:48.909]  This is truly the rogue Deep State.
[00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.451]  A group who's sworn to break our back and complete our journey to slavery.
[00:04:53.451 --> 00:04:56.272]  The good news is, no matter what they do now, they're going to lose.
[00:04:56.272 --> 00:04:57.413]  The question is how rough will it get?
[00:04:59.378 --> 00:05:02.181]  Ashley Beckford here for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:02.181 --> 00:05:08.748]  DHS releases list of 118 jurisdictions ignoring immigration laws.
[00:05:08.748 --> 00:05:18.498]  That's right, Travis County, Texas, the home of InfoWars.com, deep in the heart of Texas, is the worst offender with 142 illegals released.
[00:05:18.498 --> 00:05:21.401]  Clifford Cunningham has this report on InfoWars.com.
[00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:34.214]  The Department of Homeland Security has released its first list of jurisdictions that ignore federal immigration law, indicating nearly 200 illegal immigrants sought for deportation were released instead.
[00:05:34.214 --> 00:05:40.580]  The name and shame list was ordered released by President Donald Trump when he signed two executive orders.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.643]  Stay tuned for more immigration news at Infowars.com slash show.
[00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:01.317]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:07.898]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:07.898 --> 00:06:11.059]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:20.841]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:21.701]  Caveman.
[00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:26.762]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:28.862]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:29.182 --> 00:06:32.323]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:32.323 --> 00:06:37.465]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:45.608]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:45.608 --> 00:06:53.450]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.212]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:06:59.032 --> 00:07:02.233]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[00:08:09.935 --> 00:08:14.845]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:16.308]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:59.614 --> 00:09:05.078]  It's March 21st, 2017 on this Tuesday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:15.266]  Look at the headlines from the McClatchy News Service, published in hundreds of newspapers across the United States and now on basically every TV news station out there.
[00:09:15.266 --> 00:09:19.650]  Breitbart and Infowars under investigation for ties to Russia.
[00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.050]  Report!
[00:09:21.636 --> 00:09:26.660]  That was in committee hearing meetings last week and yesterday.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:36.807]  That's right, Stephen Bannon trying to cut middle class taxes, rebuild our military, and defend our borders and get the VA working right, as well as kill Obamacare.
[00:09:36.807 --> 00:09:38.929]  Decorated Navy officer.
[00:09:38.929 --> 00:09:47.775]  Can't trust him, can't trust anybody, but we can trust Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama and John Podesta and Michael Moore, can't we?
[00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:54.058]  And this, you see, has been built up for months.
[00:09:54.058 --> 00:09:57.380]  At first, they came out and said, oh, the Russians stole the election, it'd be too much.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:09.607]  But I told you, they were going to build it and build it until they say that Breitbart's Russian, Stephen Bannon's Russian, I'm Russian, and Trump's Russian.
[00:10:09.607 --> 00:10:16.451]  And if Trump and his people don't counter-strike when Hillary is openly on the Communist Chinese payroll, sold 30% of our uranium,
[00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:22.696]  To Russia, got all these tens of millions for it.
[00:10:22.696 --> 00:10:27.018]  And if they don't start the indictments of the open crimes they've committed, they're not going to stop.
[00:10:27.018 --> 00:10:37.062]  George Soros has doubled the amount of money he gave in the election cycle, two days after the November 8th election, to double racial division and civil unrest.
[00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:40.163]  That's their detonator for all this.
[00:10:40.163 --> 00:10:44.285]  And it's undisputed that cash flow to the Clinton Foundation from the Russians, $35 million.
[00:10:46.986 --> 00:10:47.846]  It's undisputed.
[00:10:47.846 --> 00:10:49.807]  Even the precious New York Times admits that.
[00:10:49.807 --> 00:10:53.689]  So what's the big story here?
[00:10:53.689 --> 00:11:14.118]  They have had the Board of Governors of the FCC officially come out in Senate Intelligence Committee meetings on C-SPAN and say that I'm a Russian stooge that regurgitates Russian propaganda.
[00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:27.388]  So the way around, I'm Americana and want a free market system, and my ideas are getting picked up, which are just Americana ideas that we're bringing back and making great again.
[00:11:27.388 --> 00:11:43.682]  All over the world, 15 years ago, Nigel Farage said that half the people they had joining UKIP, and the reason they were exploding was that my broadcast was the number one internet radio show, that's how they picked it up there, according to Alexa.com, Quantcast, all of them.
[00:11:46.653 --> 00:11:49.795]  Was that a Russian movement?
[00:11:49.795 --> 00:11:50.616]  No.
[00:11:50.616 --> 00:11:52.217]  That was Americana.
[00:11:52.217 --> 00:11:56.299]  America was always sexy, the whole world, until we became socialist and globalist.
[00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.581]  The world was always adopting our great ideas.
[00:11:58.581 --> 00:12:01.423]  I was just bringing them back.
[00:12:01.423 --> 00:12:07.827]  So in France, in Germany, in Sweden, in Brazil, in Japan,
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.201]  All over, they will tell you, Alex Jones.
[00:12:12.201 --> 00:12:14.402]  And I'm not here about taking credit.
[00:12:14.402 --> 00:12:23.045]  There really wasn't anybody who was even, you know, half young, who wasn't 80 years old, that was exposing this stuff.
[00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:26.587]  And I did it the 21st century way.
[00:12:26.587 --> 00:12:32.109]  Before the 21st century.
[00:12:32.109 --> 00:12:33.249]  I'm huge in Russia.
[00:12:33.249 --> 00:12:34.730]  I've never been to Russia.
[00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.031]  I've been huge on Russian TV for 15 years, playing clips of my show.
[00:12:42.099 --> 00:12:45.501]  I've been huge all over the Middle East.
[00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:46.962]  Even though I bashed radical Islam.
[00:12:46.962 --> 00:12:49.243]  Most of the Muslims don't want to live under it.
[00:12:49.243 --> 00:12:52.625]  Max Keiser goes to the Middle East live in Cairo and is being mobbed.
[00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:53.245]  Alex Jones!
[00:12:53.245 --> 00:12:53.926]  Alex Jones!
[00:12:53.926 --> 00:12:55.407]  We love... Is it Alex Jones?
[00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:58.608]  Is it Alex Jones?
[00:12:58.608 --> 00:12:59.969]  And I'm not bragging about Infowars.
[00:12:59.969 --> 00:13:02.551]  Just so you understand, we are the Infowar.
[00:13:02.551 --> 00:13:03.991]  We are 1776.
[00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:07.073]  We're Americana.
[00:13:07.073 --> 00:13:10.055]  We're what the image of John Wayne was supposed to be.
[00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:12.876]  And I love John Wayne, great patriot.
[00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:16.137]  The point is, we're doing it.
[00:13:16.137 --> 00:13:27.721]  And the globalists of the traders, they're the outside group that has come in and taken over the country, and here we are, not just in the United States, but worldwide, saying, kick the oligarchs out, kick the globalists out.
[00:13:27.721 --> 00:13:35.984]  Don't let the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the TPP, and all these deals transfer your sovereignty out of the country.
[00:13:35.984 --> 00:13:38.825]  Remember Lou Dobbs popularizing it massively?
[00:13:39.727 --> 00:13:40.888]  Ten years ago?
[00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:43.689]  Having the number one show on cable for two years?
[00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:46.471]  Even above Bill O'Reilly, CNN's only hit show?
[00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:47.591]  What'd they do?
[00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:50.213]  They fired him.
[00:13:50.213 --> 00:13:50.713]  Lou Dobbs.
[00:13:50.713 --> 00:13:56.156]  What was that, like seven, eight years ago?
[00:13:56.156 --> 00:13:59.658]  It's not about credit, it's about knowing the history.
[00:13:59.658 --> 00:14:01.839]  Drudge Report blew holes in globalism.
[00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:03.440]  Lou Dobbs blew holes in globalism.
[00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:06.316]  Dr. Corsi blew holes in it.
[00:14:06.316 --> 00:14:07.956]  World Net Daily did a great job.
[00:14:07.956 --> 00:14:09.357]  We all did this together.
[00:14:09.357 --> 00:14:10.837]  You did this.
[00:14:10.837 --> 00:14:12.558]  You exposed it at the town halls.
[00:14:12.558 --> 00:14:15.359]  You spoke out.
[00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:22.462]  And to claim it's Russian is the most ridiculous thing on earth.
[00:14:22.462 --> 00:14:23.542]  But they don't care.
[00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:29.485]  The rogue government admittedly is ignoring Trump in the State Department, in the VA, everywhere.
[00:14:29.485 --> 00:14:31.906]  These are the criminals that have seized control of our country.
[00:14:32.847 --> 00:14:39.548]  And that are robbing it and that are looting it as fast as they can.
[00:14:39.548 --> 00:14:49.771]  And what do they do when real nationalists, real patriots come out that actually want to get control of their government again and put us back on the course that made the country great?
[00:14:49.771 --> 00:14:54.512]  Getting small business loans with almost 0% interest.
[00:14:54.512 --> 00:15:01.353]  Cutting taxes, economic development zones, promoting the family, getting the morale up of the nation, not being demoralized.
[00:15:04.346 --> 00:15:15.875]  That's 180 degrees from the globalist plan of ploward and pivot and scarcity and artificial scarcity and planned obsolescence and all this de-industrialization, the post-industrial world, agenda 21.
[00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:20.598]  They play these stonewall games with all these terms like agenda 21 and others, but people know it's real.
[00:15:20.598 --> 00:15:22.340]  It's happening.
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.142]  So our victory is we forced this out in the open and you could really say
[00:15:27.113 --> 00:15:32.275]  But even according to their own publications, by March of 2017, globalism is dead.
[00:15:32.275 --> 00:15:35.636]  It's collapsing, the tide is going out on it, to quote Peter Thiel.
[00:15:35.636 --> 00:15:38.497]  The elites all admit it in their own publications.
[00:15:38.497 --> 00:15:46.460]  So they've gone from denying all this exists, to saying, okay, it exists, but the Russians are the ones destroying it.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:52.382]  So, the Board of Governors testified to Congress last week, and then they had synopses with the FBI director yesterday.
[00:15:52.382 --> 00:15:53.442]  We're going to play some of these clips.
[00:15:53.442 --> 00:15:54.743]  I'm going to skip this break.
[00:15:58.142 --> 00:15:59.363]  It's too late for hand-wringing.
[00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:00.283]  Globalism's already dead.
[00:16:00.283 --> 00:16:01.283]  That's right.
[00:16:01.283 --> 00:16:11.206]  Once it's discovered to be elite, unelected, above the law, tax-exempt, diplomatically immune, totally corrupt, the new royalty, we reject Kim Jong-un.
[00:16:11.206 --> 00:16:14.527]  We reject Queen Elizabeth II.
[00:16:14.527 --> 00:16:17.368]  We reject George Soros and the new royalty at the UN.
[00:16:17.368 --> 00:16:18.388]  We're done.
[00:16:18.388 --> 00:16:20.449]  And isn't it a bellwether, an omen that
[00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:31.097]  The father of modern globalism, the father of modern imperial corporate colonialism, died two days ago, David Rockefeller.
[00:16:31.097 --> 00:16:36.181]  The one who praised Mao Zedong's murder factory.
[00:16:36.181 --> 00:16:37.883]  So let me give you the big breakdown.
[00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:42.026]  We've now confirmed it from their own words, all of it indexed together.
[00:16:42.026 --> 00:16:45.468]  Right now, you're about to get the data dump.
[00:16:45.468 --> 00:16:45.889]  Not just
[00:16:47.230 --> 00:17:01.644]  What they're saying, and not just what they're currently doing, but what the next phases are in their attack profile against our attempt to restore the Republic.
[00:17:01.644 --> 00:17:02.325]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:05.223]  Here are the McClatchy and other headlines.
[00:17:05.223 --> 00:17:08.685]  Breitbart and Infowars under investigation for ties to Russia.
[00:17:08.685 --> 00:17:11.806]  They specifically say for working with Russian intelligence.
[00:17:11.806 --> 00:17:19.891]  They have gone so far at the FBI using the analysis of the Board of Governors of Broadcasting, which is the CIA.
[00:17:19.891 --> 00:17:22.552]  I'm going to show you in a moment.
[00:17:22.552 --> 00:17:31.497]  So rogue elements of the CIA are now declaring that the president's chief advisor, that the biggest independent media talk show host, Alex Jones,
[00:17:32.777 --> 00:17:42.939]  And others are Russian combines and actively working with the Russians, coordinating with them.
[00:17:42.939 --> 00:17:44.021]  Unbelievable.
[00:17:46.704 --> 00:17:49.847]  And of course, zero evidence is given, but this is just amazing.
[00:17:49.847 --> 00:17:57.514]  Then you realize that Podesta and all of them got caught with Google, Facebook, Twitter coordinating in the WikiLeaks how to steal the election, how to have bots.
[00:17:57.514 --> 00:18:00.717]  And they've got Donna Brazile in these articles going, it's horrible.
[00:18:00.717 --> 00:18:03.220]  We never used bots or did anything corrupt.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.542]  And Infowars is with the Russians.
[00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:07.223]  And they have Podesta in there saying that too.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:14.725]  Oh my gosh, you just ran all the big media and coordinated with the headlines at the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, everywhere else.
[00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:21.669]  You just put lies out about everybody, and now the meanie Russians got you!
[00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:29.735]  And so, you're asking, the board of, and people are asking, well how are they going to shut down InfoWars if Trump's in?
[00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:31.356]  They're intending to overthrow Trump.
[00:18:31.356 --> 00:18:32.317]  They've already said they are.
[00:18:33.356 --> 00:18:35.697]  They're already probing how to kill him right now.
[00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:38.378]  We are in a true hot civil war now.
[00:18:38.378 --> 00:18:40.139]  We're not in a cold one.
[00:18:40.139 --> 00:18:41.840]  We're winning the info war.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.602]  They've decided they're going to declare Trump a Russian agent.
[00:18:45.602 --> 00:18:50.924]  And the brains of the American resistance that are so red, white, and blue, it's ridiculous.
[00:18:50.924 --> 00:18:53.285]  We're on fire with Americana.
[00:18:53.285 --> 00:18:54.686]  We are the heart of 1776.
[00:18:54.686 --> 00:18:57.207]  And they're completely horrified by it.
[00:18:57.207 --> 00:18:59.248]  And then they have the nerve.
[00:18:59.248 --> 00:19:01.449]  It's beyond outrage I have.
[00:19:01.449 --> 00:19:02.470]  The despicableness.
[00:19:03.683 --> 00:19:21.135]  When they're the globalists that infiltrated, they're trying to make our country poor, trying to destroy our sovereignty, they have our borders wide open, with hundreds of sanctuary cities, ignoring the law, treating our veterans like total crap, looting Social Security, trying to block Trump's plan to save it, and of course they invert reality.
[00:19:21.135 --> 00:19:26.198]  They're the traitors, they're the outsiders, they're the enemies, they're the globalists!
[00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:28.500]  So in their publications where they read it,
[00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:37.179]  Foreign Affairs and the Financial Times are like, our global government's collapsing, we've got to use cultural and racial strife to control them.
[00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:40.661]  They all talk in these publications that are public like you're idiots and don't read it.
[00:19:40.661 --> 00:19:42.062]  I do.
[00:19:42.062 --> 00:19:44.483]  I show you there's quotes on air.
[00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:50.486]  But for general consumption, it's just dumbed down showing their disdain that Trump's a Russian.
[00:19:50.486 --> 00:19:51.727]  Oh, you didn't elect Trump.
[00:19:51.727 --> 00:19:54.068]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.909]  The Russians want to make America great again.
[00:19:58.439 --> 00:20:04.380]  Oh, and look, Alex Jones has gone on Russian TV shows, absolutely, and promoted that they need to have a free country as well.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.961]  And they go on on Japanese and British and Mexican and everything else.
[00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:15.343]  So again, Breitbart and Infowars under investigation, it retires the Russia report.
[00:20:15.343 --> 00:20:18.884]  The FBI's Russia influence probe, it goes to look at far-right news sites.
[00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.404]  Then they mix in, oh, it's fake!
[00:20:21.226 --> 00:20:45.657]  And then they go on and they say this, we're going to look at banning it and moving, and that's in the bill that Obama signed, S-2943, in the $611 billion 2017 Defense Authorization Act, and the NDAA, remember that's the one earlier one Obama signed where he could just disappear U.S.
[00:20:45.657 --> 00:20:46.057]  citizens?
[00:20:47.401 --> 00:20:54.548]  So they have a stay-behind, shadow, deep state government that's just completely ignoring the President, bullying Congress and everybody else.
[00:20:54.548 --> 00:20:57.131]  You better get in line because we're taking Trump out.
[00:20:57.131 --> 00:21:00.174]  And I said that two months ago in December.
[00:21:00.174 --> 00:21:01.255]  It's three months ago now.
[00:21:01.255 --> 00:21:03.036]  And you can now see it all crystallizing.
[00:21:03.777 --> 00:21:09.199]  The President just thinks he can work with people, create prosperity, and that somehow he'll convince everybody to stop doing this.
[00:21:09.199 --> 00:21:11.400]  These are people that had hijacked America.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.061]  They have a disdain for it.
[00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:16.762]  They're on recording saying they're going to break our will of the bitter clingers.
[00:21:16.762 --> 00:21:18.363]  They're in public statements saying it.
[00:21:18.363 --> 00:21:20.804]  They want to mount our heads on the wall.
[00:21:20.804 --> 00:21:24.306]  They want to dominate us as an act of will.
[00:21:24.306 --> 00:21:29.388]  Like Captain Ahab and Moby Dick in legend.
[00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:29.868]  In fiction.
[00:21:32.073 --> 00:21:33.414]  You understand?
[00:21:33.414 --> 00:21:35.355]  They don't like us because we're honorable and good.
[00:21:35.355 --> 00:21:36.836]  These are degenerate scumbags.
[00:21:36.836 --> 00:21:37.776]  Read the WikiLeaks.
[00:21:37.776 --> 00:21:41.679]  Read the evil.
[00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:46.021]  So go read the Obama quietly signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act.
[00:21:46.021 --> 00:21:47.302]  He signed it into law.
[00:21:47.302 --> 00:21:48.523]  It's still operating.
[00:21:48.523 --> 00:21:55.907]  And it says the CIA will confirm with the Board of Governors of the FCC.
[00:21:55.907 --> 00:21:57.969]  The Countering Information Warfare Act, S-2692,
[00:22:00.973 --> 00:22:05.254]  Introduced in March, passed.
[00:22:05.254 --> 00:22:10.955]  And it says they're going to ban fake news and move to block it in the United States.
[00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:18.117]  And to create a whole government strategy for countering the foreign propaganda that operates through the domestic fake news.
[00:22:18.117 --> 00:22:20.798]  Yeah, the fake news actually reads the bills here.
[00:22:20.798 --> 00:22:26.259]  Now, I'm going to play this clip of them last week talking about yours truly.
[00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:29.740]  And mixing it in with RT and Sputnik and these other channels.
[00:22:31.561 --> 00:22:35.783]  By the way, half of what I see on RT is a bunch of leftist crud.
[00:22:35.783 --> 00:22:37.544]  Yeah.
[00:22:37.544 --> 00:22:37.724]  U.S.
[00:22:37.724 --> 00:22:40.986]  repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans.
[00:22:40.986 --> 00:22:43.027]  That's foreign policy.
[00:22:43.027 --> 00:22:47.629]  Three years ago, The Washington Post admitting the CIA is going to operate domestically.
[00:22:47.629 --> 00:22:52.031]  They already were, but they admit they're going to lie to the public with this new strategy to ban fake news.
[00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:57.194]  Three years later, they intended to get Hillary in and then have her lead the charge, but she didn't get in.
[00:22:57.194 --> 00:22:59.035]  They're just acting like they're going to remove Trump regardless.
[00:22:59.035 --> 00:22:59.435]  Here's another one.
[00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:06.510]  Business Insider, US government funded domestic propaganda has officially hit the airwaves.
[00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:11.571]  Washington Post amends Russian propaganda fake news story, admits it's fake.
[00:23:11.571 --> 00:23:13.112]  Listing us as fake.
[00:23:13.112 --> 00:23:16.933]  But see now, they can't get the Washington Post to put their name on it.
[00:23:16.933 --> 00:23:20.834]  So now what are they doing?
[00:23:20.834 --> 00:23:26.995]  Now they're just going to have Congress do it and say they're going to have the FBI counter espionage group do it.
[00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:36.633]  Like they had during the Red Scare that was the Democrats, who a lot of them really were card-carrying communists, and were giving secrets away and things.
[00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:38.054]  Like the Rosenbergs.
[00:23:38.054 --> 00:23:39.754]  But this time, what great revenge!
[00:23:39.754 --> 00:23:50.698]  They're going after basically the sons of John Wayne, people that are doing the exact same things John Wayne did in his anti-communist speeches, and saying, we're the Russian stooges.
[00:23:53.447 --> 00:23:56.328]  Because we're not enemies with Russia because they've pulled out of that whole system.
[00:23:56.328 --> 00:23:57.568]  But we've got our own country.
[00:23:57.568 --> 00:24:00.168]  We want nationalism.
[00:24:00.168 --> 00:24:21.133]  So I'm going to go over all of this, but I wanted to play you a clip because when you read, who is this individual that they have on C-SPAN talking to the House Armed Services Committee and also the intelligence community this week?
[00:24:22.338 --> 00:24:25.661]  Matthew Armstrong, Associate Fellow, Center for Strategic Communication.
[00:24:25.661 --> 00:24:31.727]  But that, King's College, but that's not really what he is.
[00:24:31.727 --> 00:24:43.497]  He's a governor of the... He is a governor on the Broadcasting Board of Governors.
[00:24:44.406 --> 00:24:51.111]  And when you read the legislation that Obama signed into law right before he left, and you say, well, why doesn't Trump just kill this?
[00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:52.031]  They don't care.
[00:24:52.031 --> 00:24:55.494]  They don't follow his orders.
[00:24:55.494 --> 00:25:01.918]  They just do whatever they want and continue moving forward.
[00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:10.124]  And it goes on to say that the Board of Governors, in concert with the Central Intelligence Agency, will coordinate a whole government
[00:25:11.445 --> 00:25:29.509]  First priority program to counter the foreign propaganda disinformation and the war against us and our allies by our enemies and goes on to list fake news or domestic news and uses the Washington Post's own fake article as the roadmap.
[00:25:29.509 --> 00:25:36.051]  So they all just make up lies and then vomit them back onto each other and then vomit them back onto each other in a giant circular motion.
[00:25:39.033 --> 00:25:40.154]  So, imagine this.
[00:25:40.154 --> 00:25:44.495]  They are now openly saying, by the way, I had family yesterday when I told them about this.
[00:25:44.495 --> 00:25:51.098]  I said, yeah, I've officially been listed as under investigation by the FBI for actually working with Russian intelligence.
[00:25:51.098 --> 00:25:52.779]  And they said, come on, that's not true.
[00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:55.040]  I said, no, it's real.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.682]  Then I told a fella I know who's worked in a lot of places, including the CIA, about it.
[00:26:00.682 --> 00:26:02.223]  And he said, that's crazy.
[00:26:02.223 --> 00:26:03.543]  I'm gonna make some phone calls.
[00:26:03.543 --> 00:26:05.164]  You know, where'd that come from?
[00:26:05.164 --> 00:26:06.184]  I'm gonna call and double check those.
[00:26:06.184 --> 00:26:07.485]  I said, it came out of Comey's mouth.
[00:26:10.774 --> 00:26:16.196]  That's how incredible this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:16.196 --> 00:26:19.137]  But you're saying, no one will believe it.
[00:26:19.137 --> 00:26:19.897]  This doesn't make sense.
[00:26:19.897 --> 00:26:20.677]  There's no proof.
[00:26:20.677 --> 00:26:21.938]  They don't care.
[00:26:21.938 --> 00:26:24.558]  They already killed a lot of people.
[00:26:24.558 --> 00:26:28.240]  They've already tried to kill Roger Stone with polonium and all the rest of it.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.120]  They tried to hit and run him last week.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.681]  And they keep saying they're going to call into the Senate committee hearings, but now they're going to have hearings.
[00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:35.822]  They've had hearings, but he doesn't get to be there.
[00:26:35.822 --> 00:26:37.342]  He just gets accused.
[00:26:37.342 --> 00:26:39.123]  That's never before been done in American history.
[00:26:41.983 --> 00:26:48.511]  So, I demand if they have more hearings and talk about me, I demand that I be able to be there.
[00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:52.656]  And I'm going to be there with a big stack of news going, here you are admitting fake news.
[00:26:52.656 --> 00:26:55.920]  Here you are admitting that the Senate Intelligence Committee was targeted by the CIA with illegal spying.
[00:26:56.894 --> 00:27:02.679]  Here you are saying you're going to target domestic media you don't like, claim they're Russian spies, and now you're doing it months later.
[00:27:02.679 --> 00:27:06.221]  Why on earth is this legislation that Obama signed still in place?
[00:27:06.221 --> 00:27:07.502]  President Trump needs to kill it.
[00:27:07.502 --> 00:27:18.111]  You're not going to put me in front of that committee because my truth and my facts and my evidence will destroy these little cowards.
[00:27:18.111 --> 00:27:25.997]  I tell you, they just sit there, they have Alec Baldwin get up on TV and pose as Trump and say racist things and say he learned it from Alex Jones.
[00:27:27.602 --> 00:27:33.184]  Just like all these other movies and TV shows they've got out saying the same thing, where some character says horrible racist stuff and they say, where'd you learn that?
[00:27:33.184 --> 00:27:34.545]  I learned it from Alex Jones.
[00:27:34.545 --> 00:27:46.190]  This is the lying info war by criminals that have hijacked our government that are at war with our republic and people desperately trying to get control of the wheel to right the ship.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.621]  And you can see just a ray of sunshine into this country.
[00:27:50.621 --> 00:27:52.321]  The globalists want us poor and controlled.
[00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:55.161]  Just the idea that maybe we're open for business again.
[00:27:55.161 --> 00:27:56.742]  Three trillion in the stock market.
[00:27:56.742 --> 00:27:58.262]  Massive new job hiring.
[00:27:58.262 --> 00:27:59.702]  Wages going up.
[00:27:59.702 --> 00:28:01.243]  Restaurants busy again.
[00:28:01.243 --> 00:28:03.663]  Factories opening all over the place.
[00:28:03.663 --> 00:28:10.184]  Optimism the highest it's been since 1984.
[00:28:10.184 --> 00:28:12.765]  So the big question is how do we counter this?
[00:28:12.765 --> 00:28:14.165]  How do we respond to this?
[00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:22.476]  When we come back, I'm going to play the clip of Armstrong.
[00:28:22.476 --> 00:28:29.884]  Governor on the Broadcasting Board of Governors until last year, 2013-2016, advising Obama.
[00:28:29.884 --> 00:28:37.652]  So, you can bet money he had a hand in writing the bill that Obama signed.
[00:28:39.844 --> 00:28:45.946]  In the Defense Authorization Act to have the CIA go after the independent media.
[00:28:45.946 --> 00:28:48.987]  And guess what they do a couple months later?
[00:28:48.987 --> 00:28:53.769]  By name, yours truly, ladies and gentlemen, they mean business.
[00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:57.973]  They've been incrementally adding more lies every day.
[00:28:57.973 --> 00:29:01.876]  It'd have been absurd to say we're all Russian agents three months ago, right?
[00:29:01.876 --> 00:29:02.697]  With no proof.
[00:29:02.697 --> 00:29:05.439]  They just keep recycling the same lies that get disproven.
[00:29:05.439 --> 00:29:07.941]  No Russian connection, no hacking, no nothing.
[00:29:07.941 --> 00:29:12.165]  Oh my gosh, you know, Roger Stone tried to talk to WikiLeaks.
[00:29:12.165 --> 00:29:13.566]  So did CNN, so did everybody else.
[00:29:13.566 --> 00:29:14.687]  Of course we're trying to get the leaks.
[00:29:14.687 --> 00:29:16.969]  I don't care where they come from.
[00:29:16.969 --> 00:29:21.974]  And they turned that around, all their crimes, and the fact that they lost the election, and the fact that they rigged everything.
[00:29:22.762 --> 00:29:36.312]  And the fact that they got caught rigging stuff with CNN and rigging the debates, and then now Donna Brazile, the disgraced Donna Brazile, interviews Brian Williams, who's back, another disgraced fake, to tell everybody about how she was the target of the Russians.
[00:29:36.312 --> 00:29:38.694]  And of course, Maxine Waters says she's the target.
[00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:44.919]  And then Maxine Waters doesn't know what planet she's on, saying Russia invaded Korea.
[00:29:44.919 --> 00:29:47.561]  I mean, this is crazy, but it's also hilarious.
[00:29:48.462 --> 00:29:50.970]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.395]  We are on the march, folks.
[00:29:52.395 --> 00:29:55.083]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.281]  Ashley Beckford here for InfoWars.com.
[00:30:02.281 --> 00:30:08.823]  DHS releases list of 118 jurisdictions ignoring immigration laws.
[00:30:08.823 --> 00:30:16.606]  That's right, Travis County, Texas, the home of InfoWars.com, deep in the heart of Texas, is the worst offender with 142 illegals released.
[00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:21.629]  Clifford Cunningham has this report on InfoWars.com.
[00:30:21.629 --> 00:30:34.318]  The Department of Homeland Security has released its first list of jurisdictions that ignore federal immigration law, indicating nearly 200 illegal immigrants sought for deportation were released instead.
[00:30:34.318 --> 00:30:40.662]  The name and shame list was ordered released by President Donald Trump when he signed two executive orders.
[00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:43.325]  Stay tuned for more immigration news at Infowars.com slash show.
[00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.125]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:03.146]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:03.146 --> 00:31:06.047]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:06.047 --> 00:31:12.110]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:19.474]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[00:31:19.614 --> 00:31:21.295]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:21.295 --> 00:31:28.820]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:36.865]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:36.865 --> 00:31:37.826]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.037 --> 00:31:42.959]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:46.540]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:53.263]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:53.263 --> 00:31:57.345]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4wrestore.com.
[00:31:59.724 --> 00:32:01.565]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:01.565 --> 00:32:08.168]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:08.168 --> 00:32:11.330]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:21.114]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:21.114 --> 00:32:21.955]  Caveman.
[00:32:21.955 --> 00:32:27.017]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:27.017 --> 00:32:29.138]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:29.438 --> 00:32:32.579]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:32.579 --> 00:32:37.719]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:37.719 --> 00:32:45.861]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:45.861 --> 00:32:53.802]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:53.802 --> 00:32:58.463]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in FortWorthLife.com today.
[00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:07.082]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:07.082 --> 00:33:23.396]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.396 --> 00:33:32.264]  I told everybody 22 years ago when I first went on air that I'd sworn on the altar of God eternal resistance over every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:33:33.379 --> 00:33:49.251]  And I've prayed almost every day that God give me the will, the strength, the understanding, the honor to change the world and take on the globalists and those that are engaged in so many heinous crimes consciously against humanity.
[00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:55.396]  Murder one, premeditated, conspiracy to destroy the human system.
[00:33:55.396 --> 00:33:58.018]  That is the globalist devilish program.
[00:33:58.018 --> 00:34:01.921]  And I gotta tell you, I have seen God deliver in spades
[00:34:03.148 --> 00:34:12.035]  But always in my soul, I could feel the Holy Spirit saying, but you will pay for this.
[00:34:12.035 --> 00:34:15.799]  And I've always said that's exactly what I'm ready to do.
[00:34:15.799 --> 00:34:28.269]  Not out of self-loving or wanting to be a martyr, but because I understand that I have to sacrifice everything and you have to sacrifice as well if we're going to reverse this evil tide.
[00:34:28.269 --> 00:34:29.390]  God works through people.
[00:34:30.905 --> 00:34:44.012]  And I just was thinking this morning, it was mind-blowing just how wicked the social engineers are and how they are at war with humanity.
[00:34:44.012 --> 00:34:50.536]  And how they are attempting to build false artificial constructs, full-spectrum grids of lies.
[00:34:52.363 --> 00:34:58.228]  That they then put people into artificially who are inside the mainstream media bubble.
[00:34:58.228 --> 00:35:00.250]  It's beyond an echo chamber.
[00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:07.896]  And truly, we're telling hardcore truth with some distortion because there's no way to see things perfectly.
[00:35:07.896 --> 00:35:11.259]  And they're telling hardcore total lies.
[00:35:11.259 --> 00:35:15.003]  They're the foreign multinational globalists killing our sovereignty and freedom, taking over.
[00:35:15.834 --> 00:35:19.278]  They say we're Russian agents, because we're real Americans fighting back.
[00:35:19.278 --> 00:35:23.782]  And now, Breitbart and Infowars under investigation for ties to Russia.
[00:35:23.782 --> 00:35:25.644]  Report!
[00:35:25.644 --> 00:35:37.857]  Last week and this week, in Armed Service and Intelligence Committee hearings, they have Board of Governors of the Broadcasting Board of the FCC, now under the Central Intelligence Agency,
[00:35:41.451 --> 00:35:53.476]  As of two weeks before Obama left office, Obama quietly signed into law, 2017.
[00:35:53.476 --> 00:35:55.156]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:35:55.156 --> 00:36:06.581]  And in the Senate, S-2692, that says the CIA will be over the Board of Governors, and will take on domestic media that they claim are working with the Russians.
[00:36:08.117 --> 00:36:15.743]  Then they've got to claim you're working with the Russians with no proof to claim you're a foreign power!
[00:36:15.743 --> 00:36:19.286]  Then you're an enemy combatant under a previous NDAA.
[00:36:19.286 --> 00:36:24.270]  In National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.433]  And I told you this was all coming!
[00:36:28.433 --> 00:36:31.776]  That they would start incrementally selling the idea that there were Russkies everywhere.
[00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:40.294]  To the point of, I have media calling here saying, oh you've been on Russian TV and doesn't a Russian work there?
[00:36:40.294 --> 00:36:42.255]  Somebody who was born in Russia?
[00:36:42.255 --> 00:36:49.598]  That's the level that this country has fallen to.
[00:36:49.598 --> 00:36:55.541]  And what's crazy is, it's the Democrats that literally worked with the Russians
[00:36:57.059 --> 00:37:06.545]  From 1917 on, it was liberals in New York and London that who'd been Russian immigrants who went back to Russia and overthrew Russia.
[00:37:06.545 --> 00:37:11.188]  That's why there was such ties from the beginning.
[00:37:11.188 --> 00:37:17.572]  Russia and the Soviets, all of it was a liberal creation in America and in England.
[00:37:17.572 --> 00:37:19.453]  That's historical facts!
[00:37:19.453 --> 00:37:25.217]  And the Trotskyites!
[00:37:25.217 --> 00:37:25.437]  How?
[00:37:29.426 --> 00:37:32.808]  Isn't that incredible?
[00:37:32.808 --> 00:37:41.612]  And then they turn around to people like myself that have a sickening American pedigree.
[00:37:41.612 --> 00:37:44.234]  I mean, it doesn't get more ridiculous.
[00:37:47.458 --> 00:37:52.523]  I mean, if you did my Americana pedigree, I might win Best in Show if they had such silly things.
[00:37:52.523 --> 00:37:57.127]  But I don't get into all that, because what I do in this life, while I'm alive, counts.
[00:37:57.127 --> 00:38:04.294]  Not what my ancestors did, though I love them, and they're with me now, in spirit and in blood.
[00:38:04.294 --> 00:38:12.001]  But it's like saying George Washington or Thomas Jefferson or Andrew Jackson is a foreign enemy.
[00:38:13.669 --> 00:38:17.230]  You see, they have a dumbed-down public, but they're not even doing an info war with the public now.
[00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:22.432]  They only need the cover, in government, as an excuse to tell agencies they're going rogue.
[00:38:22.432 --> 00:38:25.592]  And I first said this in December, in an emergency warning to the President.
[00:38:25.592 --> 00:38:36.075]  I said, they're selling this narrative under COG, to have a breakaway deep state scenario, to try to block you at every level, and then finally assassinate you or impeach you.
[00:38:36.075 --> 00:38:41.177]  But they know you're too strong being able to speak, Mr. President, so before they finally move, they're going to kill you.
[00:38:43.717 --> 00:38:53.744]  And I told Stone privately, I said before they ever call you before the Senate when they start beating this drum they're going to try to kill you and indeed that happened.
[00:38:53.744 --> 00:38:57.507]  There's a good chance they'll kill him before they're even forced to call him.
[00:38:57.507 --> 00:39:11.137]  Or they may just not call him and just tell all the media you're not going to have Stone on, he can't even respond.
[00:39:11.137 --> 00:39:12.638]  So that's the level and
[00:39:13.499 --> 00:39:27.185]  Remember, they're coming for your guns, they're coming for your children, they've got your children in the public schools brainwashing them, dumbing the public down.
[00:39:27.185 --> 00:39:31.746]  They've got the veterans under their VA with their death panels not giving them treatment and letting them die.
[00:39:31.746 --> 00:39:33.687]  They'd almost won!
[00:39:33.687 --> 00:39:35.508]  They've got the glyphosates in your water table.
[00:39:36.684 --> 00:39:37.905]  They're getting away with all of it.
[00:39:37.905 --> 00:39:42.468]  They've got the MTV, admittedly, targeting and sexualizing children as young as five.
[00:39:42.468 --> 00:39:45.469]  Basically pedophile programming.
[00:39:45.469 --> 00:39:47.631]  We're under massive social engineering.
[00:39:47.631 --> 00:39:50.773]  America's being turned into a giant re-education camp.
[00:39:50.773 --> 00:39:55.776]  And they were going to drop the hammer when Hillary got in and shut down the alternative news, the independent news, calling it fake news.
[00:39:55.776 --> 00:39:56.636]  That was all admitted.
[00:39:56.636 --> 00:40:02.100]  They were in the news saying, when Hillary gets elected, in two weeks, we're going to start shutting Alex Jones and others down.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.280]  And we're going to sue them.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.302]  And we're going to have the Justice Department come after them.
[00:40:06.195 --> 00:40:09.559]  And get this, folks, they can shut us down, you're next.
[00:40:09.559 --> 00:40:10.760]  But see, Trump got in.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.904]  They didn't get to have what they wanted.
[00:40:13.904 --> 00:40:14.925]  And so now they are.
[00:40:16.758 --> 00:40:18.419]  Bleeding from the eyeballs, politically.
[00:40:18.419 --> 00:40:19.439]  They don't know what to do.
[00:40:19.439 --> 00:40:29.524]  Fareed Zarkaria is screaming and yelling and cussing fits on TV because they know their whole criminal enterprise is coming down and they are a society of scum.
[00:40:29.524 --> 00:40:32.005]  That's why they all look so ugly and look so evil.
[00:40:32.005 --> 00:40:33.606]  They don't just do bad things.
[00:40:33.606 --> 00:40:39.789]  They're hateful because they're physically and spiritually ugly.
[00:40:39.789 --> 00:40:42.610]  They're horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, weak people.
[00:40:45.882 --> 00:40:58.014]  And they see you, who love freedom, and who want a future, and who aren't a psychopath or a sociopath, and they want to dominate you because they know you're better than them.
[00:40:58.014 --> 00:41:01.958]  That's what this is all about.
[00:41:01.958 --> 00:41:04.180]  Mr. President, I know you're wholesome and good.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.462]  I know you're strong.
[00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:07.183]  I know you want to see prosperity.
[00:41:07.183 --> 00:41:08.425]  I know you want to beat these bullies.
[00:41:09.608 --> 00:41:16.895]  I know you're sick of watching America and other groups being screwed over by elites, and you want to empower the people, and they're never going to stop coming after you, sir.
[00:41:16.895 --> 00:41:18.997]  You can't ever back off of them.
[00:41:18.997 --> 00:41:20.318]  You can't take the high road.
[00:41:20.318 --> 00:41:21.960]  Don't listen to those advisors.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:28.747]  Mark my words, they're going to undermine you and claim you're a Russian agent, and they're never going to stop, and they're going to try to assassinate you.
[00:41:32.298 --> 00:41:39.141]  But first they've got to assassinate your name, so you're not looking to be on the offense, but you've got to be, because this is an outside enemy force.
[00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:41.562]  People want to know what I tell Trump?
[00:41:41.562 --> 00:41:47.305]  That's what I tell him every time I talk to him.
[00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:50.046]  Trump says I'm one of the only people he talks to who's never asked for anything.
[00:41:50.046 --> 00:41:51.887]  I don't ask him to come on the show.
[00:41:51.887 --> 00:41:53.308]  What, you want me to come on the show?
[00:41:53.308 --> 00:41:54.588]  Sure, don't even worry about that.
[00:41:54.588 --> 00:41:59.231]  You worry about your life, and you worry about identifying these people as the enemy.
[00:41:59.231 --> 00:41:59.731]  He knows it.
[00:42:01.075 --> 00:42:02.276]  So good luck, globalists.
[00:42:02.276 --> 00:42:13.688]  You may destroy me, you may destroy Trump, but I know in my heart, at an intellectual level, but at a spiritual level, God's hands on my shoulders saying, good.
[00:42:15.188 --> 00:42:19.130]  Faithfully execute this, and they will be defeated, and that's all that matters.
[00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:27.794]  We're going to execute on you, no matter what you do, and we're never gonna stop, and God is going to break you, Podesta.
[00:42:27.794 --> 00:42:29.875]  God is going to break you, Hillary.
[00:42:29.875 --> 00:42:33.017]  Fareed Zarkaria, Michael Moore, David Rockefeller.
[00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:35.418]  I guess already God just broke you.
[00:42:35.418 --> 00:42:38.299]  You're just like the rest of us now, aren't you?
[00:42:38.299 --> 00:42:39.400]  God-man.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.060]  Uber-mention.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.221]  Your whole Hitler project.
[00:42:43.584 --> 00:42:50.208]  Your UN project, your global project will all burn in the end.
[00:42:50.208 --> 00:43:08.818]  And the rivers of blood you've spilled out of the innocent will be the sea that your soul drowns in in the rotting bottomless pit forever.
[00:43:08.818 --> 00:43:10.439]  Make no mistake, they're coming for us all.
[00:43:11.852 --> 00:43:17.876]  They already come for the kids with the shots and the cancer viruses and the mercury and the poisons, the adjuvants.
[00:43:17.876 --> 00:43:20.798]  They're already coming for us with the aerosol spraying.
[00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:24.341]  They're already coming with us with the positronic brainwashing on the televisions.
[00:43:24.341 --> 00:43:32.186]  They're already admitting it all, throwing it in our face, how the robots are replacing us, ha ha ha, and all the rest of it, and how they're gods and we're nobody.
[00:43:32.186 --> 00:43:37.990]  We have nothing to lose but to resist these people in everything we've got.
[00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.832]  And we're seeing their full counter-strike right now.
[00:43:44.008 --> 00:43:57.250]  And we're seeing the Communist Chinese weigh in and declare at Davos two months ago, we will stand against the Americans with the elite!
[00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.431]  We will break Trump!
[00:43:59.431 --> 00:44:07.852]  Any American that had one ounce of soul or common sense should have gotten chills for an hour when they saw that on the news, but instead the news put it in your face like it was normal.
[00:44:07.852 --> 00:44:11.293]  Just like they say, having a mother and father is bad, don't say you have it.
[00:44:12.574 --> 00:44:22.018]  National Geographic has all the new sexes but not a woman with a womb.
[00:44:22.018 --> 00:44:31.203]  This is open scientific war carried out by those with devilish hearts against everything good.
[00:44:31.203 --> 00:44:35.685]  And the horrors visited upon the third world are now being visited upon the first world.
[00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:42.012]  Everything vile is being turned loose.
[00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:52.020]  The most radical Islamic brigades are pouring into our nations, into our homes, into our homelands.
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.742]  We see the shape of things to come.
[00:44:54.742 --> 00:44:56.263]  The great battles.
[00:44:56.263 --> 00:45:03.068]  When we look back on these times as calm, halcyon days, blue skies, endlessly clear.
[00:45:03.068 --> 00:45:06.011]  The type of day where you can even see the stars at noon.
[00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:17.492]  You'll look back on the times to come and the respite that was Trump, even as he was successful, or may not be.
[00:45:17.492 --> 00:45:30.934]  As a head coming up, as I've said, out of the water when you're caught in a riptide and getting that one big gasp of air before you're sucked back down under, hoping, holding your breath that you come back to the surface.
[00:45:30.934 --> 00:45:34.214]  But we may not even get that breath.
[00:45:34.214 --> 00:45:36.895]  Our lips are only beginning to open to try to bring in the air.
[00:45:37.884 --> 00:45:46.827]  The whole power structure is there to try to clamp our mouths shut as fast as they can, and like a satanic giant squid, suck us back down into the depths.
[00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:55.170]  I'm going to play this clip.
[00:45:55.170 --> 00:46:03.233]  But just think about how they told you three years ago, metaphysically they had to do that, so that their own people at the CIA and other places would think it was legal or lawful.
[00:46:03.233 --> 00:46:07.255]  We're going to launch domestic operations now and start lying and taking over government.
[00:46:08.797 --> 00:46:10.838]  Because the public might actually try to take the government back.
[00:46:10.838 --> 00:46:17.800]  So we've got to actually occupy the United States fully now.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:29.403]  And now with this new law in the National Defense Authorization Act, there's language in there, not just about countering it, but the full organized will to stop it.
[00:46:29.403 --> 00:46:35.405]  And that means putting silencers, suppressors on the end of guns and going around killing people and saying they committed suicide.
[00:46:38.416 --> 00:46:45.823]  As if that's not a two-way street.
[00:46:45.823 --> 00:46:49.586]  So, everybody's been warned.
[00:46:49.586 --> 00:46:55.812]  We have been absolutely judicious in what we've done, measured, and on target.
[00:46:55.812 --> 00:47:02.297]  And unfortunately, our analysis, historically, and by looking at the enemy's own transmissions, the occupied force inside the gates,
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:12.668]  We've got their dead-on attack plan, and if the President knows that attack plan and simply goes and fires side chats and exposes it to the public, it's game over for the New World Order.
[00:47:12.668 --> 00:47:15.451]  I know a lot of his advisors say it's too extreme, sir.
[00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:15.951]  No.
[00:47:15.951 --> 00:47:19.514]  The fact that he was being hardcore is why he got there.
[00:47:19.514 --> 00:47:23.198]  Every time he calls them the enemy, his approval rating goes up a couple points.
[00:47:23.198 --> 00:47:24.239]  When he doesn't, it goes down.
[00:47:25.796 --> 00:47:34.363]  The fact that he tried to work with Ryan because they're refusing to pass a good bill, he knows it'll implode the whole economy if he doesn't at least do this half-decent bill.
[00:47:34.363 --> 00:47:35.944]  That has hurt Trump.
[00:47:35.944 --> 00:47:41.728]  Because he can't compromise with these rats, they're never gonna back off.
[00:47:41.728 --> 00:47:46.732]  Trump can't give up because they're not gonna stop even if he was sold out to them, which he can't do.
[00:47:46.732 --> 00:47:48.733]  Because the image of who he is has to be destroyed.
[00:47:49.693 --> 00:47:51.355]  His family has to be destroyed.
[00:47:51.355 --> 00:47:53.597]  The earth has to be politically salted.
[00:47:53.597 --> 00:48:02.405]  And Trump understands that the nightmare system that they're bringing in is so horrible, why would you sell out to death itself when all you get is more death?
[00:48:05.731 --> 00:48:14.996]  Now, obviously, it's more important than ever that every article at InfoWars.com, every video that you send out to friends, family, neighbors, in your own email list, that you post it yourself.
[00:48:14.996 --> 00:48:16.416]  I'm getting reports from everybody I know.
[00:48:16.416 --> 00:48:17.637]  Shane Steiner called me last night.
[00:48:17.637 --> 00:48:23.520]  He said, yeah, and I was sitting there with a friend trying to post your articles to his Facebook, and they're just deleting them as fast as they go up.
[00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:30.752]  That's because they say in this, they'll work with the internet companies to shut down the Russian propaganda.
[00:48:30.752 --> 00:48:32.952]  And they just label us Russian propaganda.
[00:48:32.952 --> 00:48:35.413]  See, they can't get the courts to say we're fake because we're not.
[00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:38.334]  They can't just get media to say it because we can sue them.
[00:48:38.334 --> 00:48:42.795]  They have to have the red scare, but this time, the real red scare was real.
[00:48:42.795 --> 00:48:47.496]  This is the fake Russian scare and project it onto the patriots and try to shut us down.
[00:48:49.346 --> 00:48:50.467]  And you're like, they'll never get away with it.
[00:48:50.467 --> 00:48:51.867]  He's making the country great again.
[00:48:51.867 --> 00:48:52.548]  Americana.
[00:48:52.548 --> 00:48:54.329]  God, guns and guts securing our border.
[00:48:54.329 --> 00:48:55.389]  They're the ones with the open borders.
[00:48:55.389 --> 00:48:57.190]  They're the ones engaged in sedition and treason.
[00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:59.011]  They're the ones sold out to radical Islam.
[00:48:59.011 --> 00:49:08.176]  They don't care because they've got the government still and the rogue state intending to move forward with these attacks and they're not going to stop.
[00:49:08.176 --> 00:49:15.360]  I'm going to go to break, come back with a clip and the rest of it, but before we go any further,
[00:49:18.669 --> 00:49:22.211]  We sell out of this for months every time we get it in.
[00:49:22.211 --> 00:49:35.716]  Well, once for about three months, because it's proprietary, it's organic, it's super blue, organic, non-fluoride toothpaste with peppermint tree oil, this is the great part, iodine, and nano silver.
[00:49:35.716 --> 00:49:43.280]  Proprietary, my dad is a dentist, oral surgeon, and we made it with the biggest company out there that produces the organic toothpaste.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:43.920]  It's private label.
[00:49:45.256 --> 00:49:45.897]  That's a good question.
[00:50:07.915 --> 00:50:10.836]  Keeping America Great shirt for $9.95.
[00:50:10.836 --> 00:50:17.377]  Be sure and get a tube of the organic iodine silver bullet toothpaste.
[00:50:17.377 --> 00:50:21.898]  Infowarslife.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:50:21.898 --> 00:50:23.439]  We're under attack here.
[00:50:23.439 --> 00:50:24.559]  I asked for this.
[00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:32.841]  I'm just saying everybody's always wanted somebody to stand up, wanted somebody to fight back, somebody to really put it all on the line, somebody to be effective, somebody to build a media system, be able to counter the enemy.
[00:50:33.857 --> 00:50:34.558]  We've done it.
[00:50:34.558 --> 00:50:39.421]  We've taken the field, like David versus Goliath, and we've already chopped Goliath's head off.
[00:50:39.421 --> 00:50:42.503]  The problem is, the rest of the Philistines are coming down the hill on us.
[00:50:42.503 --> 00:50:47.027]  And you're all standing there right behind us, and you've already been supporting us, but this is the time, folks.
[00:50:47.027 --> 00:50:47.827]  We need your prayers.
[00:50:47.827 --> 00:50:49.128]  We need your support.
[00:50:49.128 --> 00:50:53.631]  We need you to spread the links and articles, because they're trying to block us all over Google, as you name it, because we're effective.
[00:50:53.631 --> 00:50:54.572]  We're in an info war.
[00:50:54.572 --> 00:50:55.833]  It's a new kind of war.
[00:50:55.833 --> 00:50:57.834]  We're winning it, but we need your help.
[00:50:57.834 --> 00:50:58.215]  We'll be back.

[00:51:58.798 --> 00:52:03.583]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:52:03.583 --> 00:52:09.308]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[00:52:33.085 --> 00:52:35.327]  They've declared total war against him.

[00:54:14.295 --> 00:54:19.197]  All the fake leftist ideologies of collectivism or slavery are breaking through it.
[00:54:19.197 --> 00:54:21.338]  It's a time of renegade.
[00:54:21.338 --> 00:54:22.398]  Of renegade.
[00:54:22.398 --> 00:54:23.519]  Alright, let's go to the clip here.
[00:54:25.382 --> 00:54:45.847]  Of the outgoing governor of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, who went before different Intelligence Committee hearings, this is the Armed Services Committee, and to the military, funding apparatus, declared that InfoWars is a Russian disinfo op.
[00:54:45.847 --> 00:54:51.748]  Then they come out in the news and McClatchy and say, I'm being investigated, along with the White House Chief Advisor.
[00:54:53.103 --> 00:55:03.230]  Like I'm trying to cut your taxes and secure our border and build up a giant military and bring coal back, which is totally like a giant sanction on Russia.
[00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:04.471]  Sorry, America first.
[00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:05.671]  It's not to hurt Russia.
[00:55:05.671 --> 00:55:06.912]  And Russia doesn't even get pissed at that.
[00:55:06.912 --> 00:55:10.294]  They understand that, you know, that this is the way it goes.
[00:55:10.294 --> 00:55:15.578]  The Russian operative, Steven Bannon, as if we need the Russians.
[00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:18.380]  Man, RT over the years has called me to come on and I've like just been
[00:55:20.196 --> 00:55:22.518]  I used to go on all the time, and they got threatened about four years ago.
[00:55:22.518 --> 00:55:25.741]  They told me, oh, they're threatening to take our license if you come on.
[00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:28.043]  Because I'd go on there about pro-gun stuff, sovereignty.
[00:55:28.043 --> 00:55:31.786]  I was just using it as a channel to promote Americana worldwide.
[00:55:31.786 --> 00:55:34.308]  Don't you want that, like a real voice of America going into Russia?
[00:55:34.308 --> 00:55:38.532]  That's what I do when I'm on Japanese TV, British TV, you name it.
[00:55:38.532 --> 00:55:45.618]  But I've got to where now when they've called me, I don't even go on there, because the response is so little on RT America, and it's a bunch of leftists.
[00:55:45.618 --> 00:55:46.759]  Have you watched RT America?
[00:55:48.544 --> 00:55:53.065]  The idea that that influenced elections when it's only in like hotel rooms and stuff.
[00:55:53.065 --> 00:55:55.006]  I've seen their ratings, it doesn't even show up.
[00:55:55.006 --> 00:55:58.307]  RT's big worldwide, but not in America.
[00:55:58.307 --> 00:56:04.889]  The idea that we would write the articles at InfoWars and then I'd see RT rewrite them two days later.
[00:56:04.889 --> 00:56:09.310]  See, they've got this butt backwards, to say it nicely.
[00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:12.091]  RT doesn't influence Alex Jones, I influence RT.
[00:56:13.504 --> 00:56:15.625]  I influence UKIP.
[00:56:15.625 --> 00:56:21.588]  The UKIP founder says the entire UKIP movement sputtered for five years until he came on my show 18 years ago.
[00:56:21.588 --> 00:56:26.691]  And he said it on the show repeatedly, half their movement came from InfoWars.
[00:56:29.735 --> 00:56:34.577]  That's super libertarian right-wing, has nothing to do with the Russians.
[00:56:34.577 --> 00:56:38.419]  Infowars is what's spreading, defeating globalism.
[00:56:38.419 --> 00:56:45.201]  And I'm not bragging, I don't ever want to get up here and say this stuff, I've known this for a long time, but because they're accusing me of being a Russian operative, I have to.
[00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:48.263]  That's the tail wagging the dog.
[00:56:48.263 --> 00:56:49.883]  Comprende?
[00:56:49.883 --> 00:56:52.684]  Americana is the dog.
[00:56:52.684 --> 00:56:54.945]  Russia's the tail.
[00:56:54.945 --> 00:56:56.566]  And Podesta and all them know that.
[00:56:58.404 --> 00:57:01.545]  But they got to change the subject because they're big losers.
[00:57:01.545 --> 00:57:03.146]  They got caught rigging the election.
[00:57:03.146 --> 00:57:04.607]  They got caught fixing everything.
[00:57:04.607 --> 00:57:05.807]  I'm going to go over that in the next hour.
[00:57:05.807 --> 00:57:08.608]  They got caught and they're scared and the people turned against them.
[00:57:08.608 --> 00:57:09.469]  So what do they do?
[00:57:09.469 --> 00:57:09.669]  Ah!
[00:57:09.669 --> 00:57:10.129]  Russians!
[00:57:10.129 --> 00:57:10.829]  Russians!
[00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:11.809]  Russians are taking over!
[00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:12.610]  Oh my God!
[00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.530]  Shut off Alex Jones!
[00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:14.070]  He's fake!
[00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:14.391]  Sue him!
[00:57:14.391 --> 00:57:15.151]  Destroy him!
[00:57:15.151 --> 00:57:19.733]  Arrest him!
[00:57:19.733 --> 00:57:23.534]  This has had the effect of actually intimidating some Republicans.
[00:57:23.534 --> 00:57:24.775]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip of Armstrong.
[00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:25.075]  Here it is.
[00:57:26.531 --> 00:57:30.112]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to, I think, Ms.
[00:57:30.112 --> 00:57:34.694]  Spears' question that there are other RTs operating in the U.S.
[00:57:34.694 --> 00:57:38.195]  Can you describe them, list them?
[00:57:38.195 --> 00:57:38.836]  Sure, thank you.
[00:57:38.836 --> 00:57:49.640]  So, you have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:56.291]  Uh, InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers for those, uh, those modalities.
[00:57:56.291 --> 00:57:58.572]  Um... And it just goes on from there.
[00:57:58.572 --> 00:58:18.696]  And then I have the actual Defense Authorization Act, 2017, saying the CIA will be over the Board of Governors, that guy, with his whole spook cutout, if you look at his background, running around, I mean, roughly, roughly half his stuff's like sporting events and riots, and it's a stringer video thing with reporters hired around the world.
[00:58:18.696 --> 00:58:19.436]  They buy video.
[00:58:22.134 --> 00:58:23.415]  They're like Getty.
[00:58:23.415 --> 00:58:29.521]  They're Russian agents now, because RT tends to buy from Ruffley, because they're cheaper.
[00:58:29.521 --> 00:58:35.406]  I've licensed clips from them.
[00:58:35.406 --> 00:58:42.312]  They'll probably claim that's the Russian connection, that I played videos of Muslims rioting.
[00:58:42.312 --> 00:58:43.854]  Man, they're desperate.
[00:58:43.854 --> 00:58:47.317]  Folks, this means they're about to move big time against Trump.
[00:58:47.317 --> 00:58:48.298]  Warning, President Trump.
[00:58:49.315 --> 00:58:55.856]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:58:55.856 --> 00:58:59.077]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:58:59.077 --> 00:59:04.638]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:59:04.638 --> 00:59:10.759]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:59:10.759 --> 00:59:14.040]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.480]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:20.021]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:59:20.021 --> 00:59:22.962]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:59:22.962 --> 00:59:24.623]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:59:24.623 --> 00:59:28.064]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:30.664]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:59:30.664 --> 00:59:31.725]  It's in powder form.
[00:59:31.725 --> 00:59:34.606]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:59:34.606 --> 00:59:35.326]  I take this.
[00:59:35.326 --> 00:59:37.126]  This is the product that I take.
[00:59:37.126 --> 00:59:39.107]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:59:39.927 --> 00:59:40.727]  We fight the Globals!
[00:59:40.727 --> 00:59:41.868]  We fight the New World Order!

[00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:47.270]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:11.883 --> 01:00:27.436]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in Occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[01:00:28.809 --> 01:00:32.052]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.052 --> 01:00:43.701]  You know, I'm gonna get really focused and serious at the start of the next segment and get into what they're accusing us of, is what they're actually doing with fake news, disinfo, and now saying I'm racist and fake news didn't work, so now I'm a Russian agent.
[01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:48.205]  This is like all over the news, FBI investigating it, I mean, wow.
[01:00:48.205 --> 01:00:53.949]  And they usually, when they get to a level like this, they tend to kill people when it's just outrageous charges.
[01:00:53.949 --> 01:00:56.671]  Then they kill you so they can just, you know, demonize the corpse, but...
[01:00:57.455 --> 01:01:00.816]  Good luck, because I'm... They'll just make us bigger.
[01:01:00.816 --> 01:01:03.316]  I guess they'll just ban my voice and everything else.
[01:01:03.316 --> 01:01:04.696]  Let's go to this joke clip, though.
[01:01:04.696 --> 01:01:05.697]  Russian agent clip.
[01:01:05.697 --> 01:01:07.857]  We made a joke a few months ago with Daria.
[01:01:07.857 --> 01:01:11.058]  Here it is.
[01:01:11.058 --> 01:01:12.738]  Activate Comrade Jones.
[01:01:12.738 --> 01:01:14.498]  Phase 2.
[01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:15.699]  Yes.
[01:01:15.699 --> 01:01:17.139]  Understand.
[01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:18.279]  Yes.
[01:01:18.279 --> 01:01:18.379]  Yes.
[01:01:18.379 --> 01:01:21.100]  Everything goes according to plan.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.080]  You must count on me.
[01:01:25.902 --> 01:01:32.484]  This morning, the Washington Post reporting that a secret CIA report found Russia interfered in the U.S.
[01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:36.325]  election to help Donald Trump win the White House.
[01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:37.845]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:01:37.845 --> 01:01:45.627]  Greg, Russian cyber spying on the United States is not anything new or anything unknown, but it seems that this takes it to an unprecedented level.
[01:01:46.487 --> 01:01:50.310]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:51.750]  I will not let you down.
[01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:55.152]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:01:55.152 --> 01:01:58.935]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot with Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:01:58.935 --> 01:02:02.137]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread.
[01:02:02.137 --> 01:02:05.959]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:07.980]  We're beholden to scum!
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.062]  Russian scum!
[01:02:10.062 --> 01:02:10.642]  You got all that?
[01:02:25.417 --> 01:02:26.259]  I was in there.
[01:02:26.259 --> 01:02:27.560]  They took me in the dark.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.862]  I met that police guy.
[01:02:28.862 --> 01:02:29.142]  Mr. Jones!
[01:02:29.142 --> 01:02:29.623]  Mr. Jones!
[01:02:29.623 --> 01:02:30.064]  Report!
[01:02:30.064 --> 01:02:31.345]  What's your report?
[01:02:31.345 --> 01:02:33.007]  Put that on the floor!
[01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:43.099]  Mr. Jones, you've been activated.
[01:02:43.099 --> 01:02:44.239]  This is very important.
[01:02:44.239 --> 01:02:46.320]  You've done your job so well.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.381]  The first part of our mission is accomplished.
[01:02:48.381 --> 01:02:50.922]  Mr. Trump is in the office soon.
[01:02:50.922 --> 01:02:52.282]  We have to build the wall.
[01:02:52.282 --> 01:02:53.843]  We have to bring the jobs back.
[01:02:53.843 --> 01:02:56.063]  We have to build the economy and families.
[01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:57.464]  Yes, defeat the Americans.
[01:02:57.464 --> 01:02:59.164]  Defeat the Americans.
[01:02:59.164 --> 01:03:00.285]  Stop the tranny bathrooms.
[01:03:00.285 --> 01:03:00.605]  Yes, yes.
[01:03:00.925 --> 01:03:01.625]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:03.266]  Oh, now, now, let me tell you.
[01:03:03.266 --> 01:03:05.246]  Some of it is good, some bad.
[01:03:05.246 --> 01:03:12.629]  They loved Hillary so beautiful and pure that we turned, we turned, we turned them from the beautiful angel to the devil.
[01:03:12.629 --> 01:03:14.089]  I, I, I'm sorry.
[01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.869]  I was in America.
[01:03:14.869 --> 01:03:16.730]  I learned that Hillary was good.
[01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:18.951]  No, we have to continue to do our mission.
[01:03:18.951 --> 01:03:20.711]  But comrades, he will get angry.
[01:03:20.711 --> 01:03:25.873]  They learned that our top agent is Tucker Carlson, the congressman, the congressman on TV.
[01:03:26.413 --> 01:03:30.234]  You're carrying water for the Kremlin.
[01:03:30.234 --> 01:03:31.635]  I'm not carrying water for the Kremlin.
[01:03:31.635 --> 01:03:35.996]  You're a sitting member of Congress on the inside committee and you can't say they hacked.
[01:03:35.996 --> 01:03:44.939]  You're going to have to move your show to our Russian television because this is so beneath your office because it's so dumb and you're being duplicitous.
[01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:49.220]  The programs are moving forward to cut the taxes and to allow Americans to breathe again.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:55.043]  And the program is working to contain the collapse of the United States so it does not fall to globalism.
[01:03:55.043 --> 01:03:59.864]  And the report is continuing to not fund radical jihadis and other evils.
[01:03:59.864 --> 01:04:06.667]  And the report is continuing to let the families actually raise their children and not give them the vaccines and lower their IQs.
[01:04:06.667 --> 01:04:08.688]  We are destroying America as planned.
[01:04:08.688 --> 01:04:10.388]  We are doing well.
[01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.309]  And it's wrong because Hillary is in danger.
[01:04:12.569 --> 01:04:17.352]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:04:17.352 --> 01:04:23.596]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[01:04:44.711 --> 01:04:45.971]  Russian scum!
[01:04:59.344 --> 01:05:02.148]  Ashley Beckford here for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:08.695]  DHS releases list of 118 jurisdictions ignoring immigration laws.
[01:05:08.695 --> 01:05:16.485]  That's right, Travis County, Texas, the home of InfoWars.com, deep in the heart of Texas, is the worst offender with 142 illegals released.
[01:05:18.427 --> 01:05:21.492]  Clifford Cunningham has this report on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:21.492 --> 01:05:33.890]  The Department of Homeland Security has released its first list of jurisdictions that ignore federal immigration law, indicating nearly 200 illegal immigrants sought for deportation were released instead.
[01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:54.004]  The Name and Shame List was ordered released by President Donald Trump when he signed two executive orders related to immigration in January in response to a number of local jurisdictions that have refused to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as self-declared, quote, sanctuary cities.
[01:05:54.004 --> 01:05:58.588]  Stay tuned for more immigration news at infowars.com slash show.
[01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:02.412]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:02.412 --> 01:06:03.553]  They lost.
[01:06:03.553 --> 01:06:04.054]  We won.
[01:06:04.054 --> 01:06:10.240]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:14.165]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:06:14.921 --> 01:06:20.744]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:26.887]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:06:26.887 --> 01:06:32.289]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:35.631]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.072]  We're the solution!
[01:06:37.072 --> 01:06:38.052]  Americans!
[01:06:38.052 --> 01:06:39.593]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:06:39.593 --> 01:06:44.976]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:06:44.976 --> 01:06:46.637]  Theatrical screening's on demand.
[01:06:46.637 --> 01:06:48.538]  DVD's now available.
[01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:52.000]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.161]  Americans need to see this film.
[01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:05.582]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:07:05.582 --> 01:07:06.422]  I take this.
[01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:07.543]  My family takes this.
[01:07:07.543 --> 01:07:11.847]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:07:11.847 --> 01:07:16.051]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:07:16.431 --> 01:07:21.075]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:07:21.075 --> 01:07:22.215]  I don't feel good.
[01:07:22.215 --> 01:07:25.978]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:07:25.978 --> 01:07:28.660]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:34.465]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:07:34.465 --> 01:07:37.427]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:07:37.427 --> 01:07:40.950]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:43.192]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:43.552]  I love it.
[01:07:43.712 --> 01:07:46.494]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:07:46.494 --> 01:07:47.515]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:47.515 --> 01:07:53.160]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.342]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:07:55.342 --> 01:07:56.583]  It's a win-win.
[01:07:56.583 --> 01:07:57.384]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:20.444]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:08:20.444 --> 01:08:24.807]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:24.807 --> 01:08:28.990]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:31.552]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:31.552 --> 01:08:41.059]  Who would have thought that the Russian command base would be run by an 8th generation Texan whose both sides of his family helped found the state?
[01:08:42.088 --> 01:08:54.436]  And who is related on both sides of the Mayflower and related to a lot of the leaders in the Revolutionary War that I never even say that because it just it sounds too fantastical, directly related.
[01:08:54.436 --> 01:09:03.722]  In fact, my mom and dad's families both, strangely enough, they've done genealogy weave back and forth from the very start of the country from before when it was colonies.
[01:09:04.602 --> 01:09:30.829]  At the very start, it's amazing how genetics works, and it ended up here in Texas, both sides of the family, predominantly, almost all my ancestors ended up moving down into Tennessee, Alabama, you name it, and to have most of my family that were men in the Cold War, fighting the Communists and the Russians in Latin America, Europe, you name it, and right here in Texas, I'll just leave it at that, to then be accused of being a Russian brainwashing conduit.
[01:09:32.188 --> 01:09:41.720]  And I'm under investigation, according to the FBI, that's in McClatchy, you name it, for actually being in league with Russian intelligence agents.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:47.488]  And so is the White House chief advisor, Stephen Bannon, decorated naval officer, super patriot.
[01:09:49.497 --> 01:09:51.018]  Well, what do you do when you lose an election?
[01:09:51.018 --> 01:10:00.824]  What do you do when you're caught with CNN and all the other major channels rigging the debates and rigging polls and it's in thousands of emails that, you know, you're involved in all sorts of weird criminal activity?
[01:10:00.824 --> 01:10:05.707]  What do you do when it comes out you're at Aleister Crowley's satanic rituals?
[01:10:05.707 --> 01:10:10.851]  What do you do when it turns out you're on the Communist Chinese payroll and all the intelligence agencies know it?
[01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:16.975]  You boldly flip everything and blame the few patriots that have taken over the Republican Party
[01:10:18.066 --> 01:10:23.040]  With being Russian agents, and you tell the American people you didn't win any election, you're a nobody!
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.601]  You lost!
[01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:27.871]  That's what they've done.
[01:10:27.871 --> 01:10:29.552]  Now, first, I want to go to this short piece.
[01:10:29.552 --> 01:10:42.094]  It's more powerful, obviously, in video at InfoWars.com forward slash show or any radio listener can go on their smartphone or their iPad or their whatever they've got or their desktop and watch the slash TV radio show.
[01:10:42.094 --> 01:10:44.735]  You can always share that link with folks in the information war.
[01:10:44.735 --> 01:10:46.515]  In fact, that's critical.
[01:10:46.515 --> 01:10:48.516]  But this is South by Southwest Zombies.
[01:10:48.976 --> 01:10:54.262]  Who buy into any trendiness that they're sold or any trendiness that is pushed on them.
[01:10:54.262 --> 01:11:06.636]  And these are the people howling with delight in the comment sections of Media Matters and Raw Story about, arrest Alex, he's an agent, shut him down, get rid of his speech, throw him in a jail cell.
[01:11:06.636 --> 01:11:07.778]  Boy, you're liberal, aren't you?
[01:11:09.206 --> 01:11:22.713]  There's literally hundreds of movies and TV shows about the Red Scare and the Black List and how card-carrying communists that were admittedly trying to overthrow the country got banned from Hollywood.
[01:11:22.713 --> 01:11:27.755]  They had free speech as American citizens, but not working for a foreign power.
[01:11:27.755 --> 01:11:34.978]  I mean, they were writing books and articles about how we should become communists and how they should arrest the opposition.
[01:11:34.978 --> 01:11:37.880]  When you're saying arrest the opposition, you no longer have free speech.
[01:11:40.418 --> 01:11:42.481]  But it's who says it first.
[01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:48.711]  The group that says, let's arrest our opposition, let's kill them, then the other group has a right to go arrest you.
[01:11:48.711 --> 01:11:52.397]  And by the way, dumbos, that's the road this is going down.
[01:11:54.016 --> 01:12:01.778]  Oh yeah, you thought Hillary was invincible and was going to win if you're stupid enough to try some false flags to blame the Liberty Movement.
[01:12:01.778 --> 01:12:09.420]  If you're dumb enough to try to do this, you're dumb enough to try to have rogue elements of the government that are already involved in all sorts of sedition against the presidency and the voters.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:18.142]  If you are stupid enough to think that you're going to be able to get the dog to hunt, to actually try to kill Trump and have some big COG operation, Trump is ready.
[01:12:18.142 --> 01:12:19.783]  Why do you think you put all those generals in around him?
[01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:27.338]  In fact, it's a joke at the CIA what you're trying, and I mean the real CIA.
[01:12:27.338 --> 01:12:32.163]  You noticed all these retired CIA guys are out all over the place, liberal and conservative, for Trump everywhere?
[01:12:32.163 --> 01:12:36.628]  Because Trump's not even a conservative, he's a populist Americana.
[01:12:36.628 --> 01:12:39.191]  He's a unifier.
[01:12:40.469 --> 01:12:42.570]  But first, you gotta admit you have a country.
[01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:45.772]  To be a country, to have a culture, and then be unified.
[01:12:45.772 --> 01:12:47.153]  They call that outrageous.
[01:12:47.153 --> 01:12:52.396]  Like, the UN says, Angelina Jolie last week, we can't have a country.
[01:12:52.396 --> 01:12:57.079]  Why, nationalism, like it's dirty, is masquerading as patriotism.
[01:12:57.079 --> 01:13:00.301]  As if you don't know what nationalism and patriotism is.
[01:13:00.301 --> 01:13:05.684]  Patriotism is being a patriot for your nation and the set of values and the culture.
[01:13:05.684 --> 01:13:07.745]  It's the same thing!
[01:13:07.745 --> 01:13:10.007]  Or it's like a man and woman, a horse and carriage.
[01:13:14.619 --> 01:13:22.963]  But that's how alien this has gotten, where, oh my gosh, we can't have nationalism or have a country that actually tries to have jobs inside and make business deals for the good of the people.
[01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:29.227]  It's supposed to be for the global elites, so they become trillionaires, not just billionaires, and can leverage out everyone and take over the world.
[01:13:29.227 --> 01:13:30.608]  I mean, what the hell?
[01:13:30.608 --> 01:13:32.569]  We've got a guy trying to make America great.
[01:13:32.569 --> 01:13:34.330]  He's a Russian agent!
[01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:36.551]  And Alex Jones is!
[01:13:45.558 --> 01:13:47.799]  That's hilarious.
[01:13:47.799 --> 01:13:54.824]  That's absolutely hilarious.
[01:13:54.824 --> 01:14:12.295]  I mean, to me it's particularly insulting knowing the things I know about the government, and knowing what's going on behind the scenes, and knowing who the Democrats really are, the most horrible people the world's ever seen.
[01:14:13.283 --> 01:14:19.745]  And to know that they've had the communist Russians on their arm since 1917.
[01:14:19.745 --> 01:14:24.166]  Oh no, the Russians don't have their arm up, the Democrats are around.
[01:14:24.166 --> 01:14:25.207]  It's the other way around.
[01:14:25.207 --> 01:14:30.068]  The Democrats literally created the Bolshevik Revolution.
[01:14:30.068 --> 01:14:32.929]  Look it up, it's not even secret, it's in the encyclopedia.
[01:14:33.942 --> 01:14:44.130]  The Democratic Party in New York and the Communist Party in England created the Bolshevik Revolution and took over Russia, and then murdered tens of millions of Christian Russians.
[01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:45.951]  And they want to do the same thing here!
[01:14:45.951 --> 01:14:49.114]  That's why Obama's in these secret capes going, I'll get these Christians!
[01:14:49.114 --> 01:14:51.235]  These bitter clingers will break their will, don't worry!
[01:14:57.645 --> 01:15:00.247]  And Russia finally got this big spider off of him.
[01:15:00.247 --> 01:15:02.229]  It's like trying to crawl, trying to get on its knees.
[01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:04.070]  Trying to wash the wounds out.
[01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:06.812]  And they're just hopping up and down going, Nooooo!
[01:15:06.812 --> 01:15:08.013]  You were ours for 80 years!
[01:15:08.013 --> 01:15:09.134]  We're gonna get you Russians!
[01:15:09.134 --> 01:15:11.436]  And they're like, Shut up America!
[01:15:11.436 --> 01:15:12.296]  Slap us right in the face.
[01:15:12.296 --> 01:15:14.918]  You lay down there, you don't even say mother or father.
[01:15:14.918 --> 01:15:17.520]  We're gonna teach your five year olds about sex.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.162]  On MTV and Sumner Redstone says so.
[01:15:20.162 --> 01:15:24.586]  And you sit there and you take it.
[01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:26.247]  And Alex Jones is a Russian agent.
[01:15:29.721 --> 01:15:36.802]  And they've got so much confidence, and so many people brainwashed, and so many cowards and yes-men in the media and the Congress lined up.
[01:15:36.802 --> 01:15:44.704]  You can see from their confidence, and it's ill-fated confidence.
[01:15:44.704 --> 01:15:46.324]  Man, they go to the next level.
[01:15:46.324 --> 01:15:51.085]  It is going to be unbelievably spectacular.
[01:15:51.085 --> 01:15:56.646]  It's like they haven't read in the chemistry book what they're mixing, and I'm just trying to get to the exit.
[01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:10.546]  We know how this ends, by the way.
[01:16:10.546 --> 01:16:14.348]  I just kind of feel like I metaphysically need to warn the globalists, you need to stop.
[01:16:14.348 --> 01:16:18.349]  In fact, you need to stop right now for your own good and for everybody else's good.
[01:16:18.349 --> 01:16:21.350]  You need to stop right now.
[01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:22.851]  Danger.
[01:16:22.851 --> 01:16:23.551]  Danger.
[01:16:23.551 --> 01:16:24.511]  You need to stop right now.
[01:16:24.511 --> 01:16:27.993]  In fact, I'm not going to get to the piece on South by Southwest first.
[01:16:29.025 --> 01:16:33.166]  And I'm going to play it at the bottom of the yard because it dovetails with the intro we're going to play in Premiere here that McBrain put together.
[01:16:33.166 --> 01:16:34.986]  It's powerful.
[01:16:34.986 --> 01:16:57.091]  Let me play, just to remind you where we're at, John McCain a week ago saying that Senator Rand Paul, because he doesn't want treaties in Montenegro and another treaty in the Civil War-torn Ukraine and into the East, bordering Russia with the Crimea,
[01:16:58.988 --> 01:17:04.030]  That he wasn't just going to let him, without debate, pass the treaty through to go to the full Senate.
[01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:09.711]  And so McCain, after saying five times you're working for Russia, says you are an agent of Vladimir Putin.
[01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:12.492]  Remember that?
[01:17:12.492 --> 01:17:26.197]  And I didn't realize that that very same day they were in the House Intelligence Committee and the House Armed Services Committee with a bunch of CIA guys, but a bunch of policy elite blue-blood wonks, not the real CIA.
[01:17:27.315 --> 01:17:30.036]  Not the CIA that actually doesn't work.
[01:17:30.036 --> 01:17:47.424]  They were there getting them ready with the bill Obama already got in the Defense Authorization Act with the new NDAA to begin shutting down the conservative and libertarian media and banning talk radio and bringing back a fairness doctrine with the CIA over it.
[01:17:47.424 --> 01:17:48.065]  Skip the break.
[01:17:48.065 --> 01:17:48.985]  Coming up.
[01:17:48.985 --> 01:17:52.567]  Who the hell could come up with that?
[01:17:52.567 --> 01:17:53.287]  And it's all right here.
[01:17:55.373 --> 01:17:58.996]  And of course, Rand Paul came out today and showed his sanity.
[01:17:58.996 --> 01:18:00.637]  I love Rand Paul.
[01:18:00.637 --> 01:18:04.860]  He was kind of dormant.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:11.084]  Like a bear hibernating or something off in the last few years, but he's back.
[01:18:11.084 --> 01:18:20.591]  And the doctor was on the news and he said, they're all over the news saying they were surveilling Flynn and had all this stuff.
[01:18:20.591 --> 01:18:21.192]  Remember?
[01:18:21.192 --> 01:18:22.473]  Of course they were surveilling Trump.
[01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:27.975]  We already know that, Alex, but at least he said it!
[01:18:27.975 --> 01:18:36.600]  See, they create this whole false reality where they sit around and tell us they never said they had intercepts or wiretaps on the Trump people, the Russians.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:41.883]  When it came out there was nothing in them, Trump said, okay, you broke the law with leaks.
[01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:45.085]  They went, oh, we weren't surveilling!
[01:18:45.085 --> 01:18:46.386]  Think about how dumb they are.
[01:18:46.386 --> 01:18:52.390]  So, I guess I'm in good company having Armed Services Committee hearings about how
[01:18:53.965 --> 01:18:55.986]  I'm in league with the Russians.
[01:18:55.986 --> 01:18:57.708]  And again, here's the headline, McClatchy.
[01:18:57.708 --> 01:18:59.669]  This was in hundreds of newspapers.
[01:18:59.669 --> 01:19:01.530]  In fact, Google the syndication of McClatchy.
[01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:06.593]  Because this is like being republished in papers that don't even normally carry McClatchy.
[01:19:06.593 --> 01:19:10.656]  And I've said McClatchy's done good work before, at least compared to a lot of mainstream media.
[01:19:10.656 --> 01:19:16.320]  Breitbart and Infor's under investigation for ties to Russia.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:23.325]  And it says we're under criminal investigation, but the FBI rarely indicts you through their
[01:19:24.537 --> 01:19:26.037]  Counter-espionage arm.
[01:19:26.037 --> 01:19:31.598]  What the f... And again, this is obviously a threat.
[01:19:31.598 --> 01:19:33.599]  Like, stop doing what you're doing.
[01:19:33.599 --> 01:19:34.959]  Stop exposing what's happening.
[01:19:34.959 --> 01:19:36.879]  Stephen Mann and Alex Jones.
[01:19:36.879 --> 01:19:37.400]  Donald Trump.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.640]  We're going to keep going down this road.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.620]  Go down the road.
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:41.020]  Do whatever you're going to do.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.821]  Feel your hand, okay?
[01:19:42.821 --> 01:19:44.741]  My family comes from Americans.
[01:19:44.741 --> 01:19:49.722]  My family comes from honorable people that have built this country and have defended it and are defending it now and restoring it.
[01:19:50.642 --> 01:19:51.703]  I'm not a coward.
[01:19:51.703 --> 01:19:55.525]  I love how they always threaten us as if we don't know what you're capable of.
[01:19:55.525 --> 01:20:03.029]  Just do it!
[01:20:03.029 --> 01:20:11.875]  It's this cheesy Star Wars analogy where Darth Vader says, you should not have come back.
[01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:15.937]  Escape is not my plan.
[01:20:15.937 --> 01:20:18.678]  I intend to go head-on against the New World Order.
[01:20:18.678 --> 01:20:19.399]  I always have.
[01:20:21.658 --> 01:20:23.080]  As an example to others.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:27.406]  I mean, if I fall like the Alamo, I personally am not happy about that.
[01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:32.334]  I want my kids to have a great future and have their dad there, but they don't have a future if we don't pick these people anyways.
[01:20:32.334 --> 01:20:33.215]  I'm all in!
[01:20:33.215 --> 01:20:34.477]  Feels so good!
[01:20:34.477 --> 01:20:35.398]  All the chips in.
[01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:36.219]  Boom, baby.
[01:20:36.219 --> 01:20:36.700]  Boom.
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:37.081]  I love it.
[01:20:40.333 --> 01:20:43.836]  Let me sign that John Hancock on that Declaration of Independence against the New World Order.
[01:20:43.836 --> 01:20:46.338]  A lot of people are signing it real small because they didn't know how dangerous it was.
[01:20:46.338 --> 01:20:51.682]  Signing it on against the King of England that nobody defeated Britain in 400 years before that.
[01:20:51.682 --> 01:20:52.703]  Not the biggest empires.
[01:20:52.703 --> 01:20:55.866]  Let me just sign my name real big for you.
[01:20:55.866 --> 01:20:57.727]  Right there.
[01:20:57.727 --> 01:21:00.269]  On the New Declaration of Independence.
[01:21:00.269 --> 01:21:02.151]  You see that?
[01:21:02.151 --> 01:21:02.551]  It's red again.
[01:21:08.584 --> 01:21:09.244]  I'm signed.
[01:21:09.244 --> 01:21:10.204]  I'm a dotted line.
[01:21:10.204 --> 01:21:10.825]  Forever.
[01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:11.185]  Right there.
[01:21:11.185 --> 01:21:11.625]  You see that?
[01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:16.126]  I love it.
[01:21:16.126 --> 01:21:17.486]  It's the animating contest of liberty.
[01:21:17.486 --> 01:21:18.167]  It's real.
[01:21:18.167 --> 01:21:19.167]  And look how weak they are.
[01:21:19.167 --> 01:21:23.888]  That some operation I set up 20-something years ago was devastating them.
[01:21:23.888 --> 01:21:29.010]  It's not that I'm that good, it's that they're that weak and pathetic.
[01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:37.632]  Oh my gosh, they're going to call me racist on NBC's comedy show, Saturday Night Live.
[01:21:38.976 --> 01:21:42.099]  They're the discredited scum.
[01:21:42.099 --> 01:21:43.440]  They can say I rob banks.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:43.960]  It isn't true.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.341]  They can make up whatever crap they want.
[01:21:45.341 --> 01:21:48.704]  I don't care.
[01:21:48.704 --> 01:21:50.645]  Because I know I have integrity.
[01:21:50.645 --> 01:21:54.529]  I know what I stand for.
[01:21:54.529 --> 01:21:58.812]  And I look at Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and the leadership of the Democratic Party.
[01:21:58.812 --> 01:22:00.974]  They don't even know what planet they're on.
[01:22:01.937 --> 01:22:13.420]  And then they've got these corrupt bureaucracies and all these agencies playing God that think they can ignore the President and they can ignore the will of the people.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:16.541]  I'm not intimidated by them.
[01:22:16.541 --> 01:22:18.222]  Quite the opposite.
[01:22:18.222 --> 01:22:23.483]  I'm sad for them because I wish they could be part of the honor.
[01:22:23.483 --> 01:22:25.864]  But nine times out of ten, you go look up these people,
[01:22:27.782 --> 01:22:38.546]  And they were Tories, or they were scumbags, or most of their family were swindlers and criminals, and that's why they're where they are, because they're fake scum.
[01:22:38.546 --> 01:22:53.372]  And then, I'm not bragging, you go back and look at my family, just devastating tyranny, devastating scum, devastating bullies, creating new systems, empowering people, taking on all the odds, winning over and over again, even when we are destroyed.
[01:22:54.321 --> 01:22:55.862]  You're going to be destroyed.
[01:22:55.862 --> 01:22:56.703]  I know it.
[01:22:56.703 --> 01:23:00.246]  So feel that and know that and understand that's not confidence.
[01:23:00.246 --> 01:23:00.927]  That's fact.
[01:23:00.927 --> 01:23:03.249]  You are destroyed.
[01:23:03.249 --> 01:23:07.112]  You are weak like your family, like the trash you come from.
[01:23:07.112 --> 01:23:08.553]  Remember that.
[01:23:08.553 --> 01:23:10.455]  You'll never defeat humanity.
[01:23:10.455 --> 01:23:12.457]  You'll never stop us.
[01:23:12.457 --> 01:23:18.662]  All your robotics and GMO and your attempts to wreck the planet are all going to come to a screeching halt.
[01:23:18.662 --> 01:23:21.665]  Your attacks on humanity are only going to empower us.
[01:23:25.046 --> 01:23:26.947]  You don't have gravity, you rot.
[01:23:26.947 --> 01:23:28.188]  This tyranny's gravity.
[01:23:28.188 --> 01:23:30.570]  And the gravity's being turned up to make us strong.
[01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:34.032]  It's a free world universe.
[01:23:34.032 --> 01:23:35.133]  It's a free will.
[01:23:35.133 --> 01:23:39.716]  All right, let's start going on these clips.
[01:23:39.716 --> 01:23:52.184]  So, I'm in good company with people like Donald Trump, people like Tucker Carlson,
[01:23:54.062 --> 01:24:04.190]  People like Senator Rand Paul, who dare to not just believe whatever Republicans and Democrats are saying, making up about Russia this, Russia that.
[01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:14.438]  If you dare to challenge it and say there's no proof, which there isn't, all there is is giant proof on the Democrats' side, then you're a Russian agent.
[01:24:14.438 --> 01:24:15.359]  Well, then so be it.
[01:24:15.359 --> 01:24:19.402]  Here's Senator Rand Paul being attacked by McCain last week.
[01:24:20.796 --> 01:24:26.558]  The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made.
[01:24:26.558 --> 01:24:38.181]  He has no justification for his objection to having a small nation be part of NATO that is under assault from the Russians.
[01:24:38.181 --> 01:24:45.603]  So I repeat again, the Senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[01:24:45.603 --> 01:24:50.264]  And of course the lie is 90% of the time when they're doing those procedural bills you don't respond or have a debate.
[01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:55.895]  McCain runs in to try to sneak something through procedurally.
[01:24:55.895 --> 01:24:57.378]  He runs down, blocks it, leaves.
[01:24:57.378 --> 01:24:59.181]  Let's start a war in Montenegro.
[01:24:59.181 --> 01:25:00.843]  Send in troops to Montenegro.
[01:25:00.843 --> 01:25:03.448]  No, McCain, sorry, you're not starting a war there.
[01:25:03.448 --> 01:25:03.949]  In the Balkans.
[01:25:06.104 --> 01:25:15.127]  Just like you and the Clintons did before in the 90s, to bring the Muslims in out of Albania, take one third of Serbia, and then have the news say Serbia was involved in atrocities.
[01:25:15.127 --> 01:25:16.167]  BS!
[01:25:16.167 --> 01:25:18.728]  Double the Serbs died, and they didn't start the war!
[01:25:18.728 --> 01:25:24.350]  Just like McCain started the Ukraine war, when George Soros brags about it, and then says the Russians have started it!
[01:25:25.791 --> 01:25:33.555]  Oh, the Russians only kept 15% of the country, when half of it's been historically Russian, so you can't murder all the ethnic Russians.
[01:25:33.555 --> 01:25:39.478]  When 98% in Poles in Ukraine, in the eastern part, want Russia to come back in.
[01:25:39.478 --> 01:25:44.321]  That isn't me siding with Russia, it's siding with sanity!
[01:25:44.321 --> 01:25:47.242]  You started the war, McCain!
[01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:48.623]  You're a globalist agent.
[01:25:48.623 --> 01:25:51.324]  You work with that Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[01:25:51.324 --> 01:25:53.685]  When is he going to roll over like David Rockefeller?
[01:25:53.685 --> 01:25:54.406]  Good God!
[01:25:55.165 --> 01:25:58.309]  We got another 12 years of him?
[01:25:58.309 --> 01:26:01.432]  So he's 101?
[01:26:01.432 --> 01:26:02.714]  You people are cancer.
[01:26:02.714 --> 01:26:05.397]  John McCain is cancer to this country.
[01:26:05.397 --> 01:26:08.901]  So, here's Tucker Carlson again with the other little weirdo.
[01:26:08.901 --> 01:26:13.025]  I mean, I'm sorry, I'm not saying that Schiff is a pervert.
[01:26:13.025 --> 01:26:15.528]  He has the biggest pervert eyes I've ever seen.
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:19.005]  It's like some guys look like serial killers, have serial killer eyes.
[01:26:19.005 --> 01:26:21.269]  I mean, this guy's got pervert eyes.
[01:26:21.269 --> 01:26:27.380]  But what I do know is, he's up there perving around with our Constitution, trying to say Tucker Carlson's carrying water for Putin.
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:27.640]  Here it is.
[01:26:28.271 --> 01:26:29.192]  ...water for the Kremlin.
[01:26:29.192 --> 01:26:30.674]  You're not carrying water for the Kremlin!
[01:26:30.674 --> 01:26:40.044]  You're making, look, you're a sitting member of Congress on the inside committee, and you can't say... You're gonna have to move your shoulder to RT, Russian television, because... You know what?
[01:26:40.044 --> 01:26:48.634]  That's just so beneath your office, because it's so dumb, and you're being... Alright, now let's, and there's a bunch of these, but of course they've said Trump's this dupe of Putin.
[01:26:49.833 --> 01:26:51.574]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[01:26:51.574 --> 01:26:58.420]  Again, this is the outgoing head of the Board of Governors of the FCC that under now new law that Trump hasn't repealed or blocked.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:00.501]  This has, I guess, been an issue.
[01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:03.344]  That they want to ban Breitbart, Infowars, and we're Russian agents.
[01:27:03.344 --> 01:27:06.166]  And in the legislation it says they could even use force.
[01:27:06.166 --> 01:27:08.628]  Military guys could come and kill us.
[01:27:08.628 --> 01:27:12.711]  Which the left, I'm sure, would just love.
[01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:13.511]  So let's go back to the clip.
[01:27:13.511 --> 01:27:13.732]  Here it is.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.263]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to, I think, Ms.
[01:27:19.263 --> 01:27:23.847]  Spears' question that there are other RTs operating in the U.S.
[01:27:23.847 --> 01:27:27.351]  Can you describe them, list them?
[01:27:27.351 --> 01:27:28.011]  Sure, thank you.
[01:27:28.011 --> 01:27:38.821]  So, you have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Ruppli, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[01:27:39.774 --> 01:27:45.458]  Uh, InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers for those, uh, those modalities.
[01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:53.704]  Um... Sputnik.
[01:27:53.704 --> 01:27:55.605]  It's a website in Russia.
[01:27:55.605 --> 01:27:58.467]  Has almost no effects in the US.
[01:27:58.467 --> 01:28:07.194]  Ripley is like Getty and gathers videos and photos and clips from, like, football games and movie stars and Muslims rioting.
[01:28:08.231 --> 01:28:10.993]  I've got a stack of news we're going to cover when we come back from breaking up.
[01:28:10.993 --> 01:28:12.453]  Thumbs up on this.
[01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:14.675]  This is an attack on free press, an attack on Trump.
[01:28:14.675 --> 01:28:16.456]  They're dropping the hammer here.
[01:28:16.456 --> 01:28:17.996]  This is a total declaration of war.
[01:28:17.996 --> 01:28:21.719]  I told you months ago this was coming, but now it's no longer my gut, which is always right.
[01:28:21.719 --> 01:28:23.159]  It's now documented.
[01:28:23.159 --> 01:28:32.625]  I've got stacks of news where Google fixed searches for Hillary, blocked everybody else, launched massive bots with Facebook, Twitter, and Google to massively boost Hillary, banned links promoting Trump.
[01:28:33.445 --> 01:28:40.849]  20th Century Fox put out over 100 fake websites with thousands of fake news articles trying to stop Trump with all sorts of horrible lies about him.
[01:28:40.849 --> 01:28:42.230]  The Washington Post admitted that.
[01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:42.790]  No problem.
[01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:43.591]  No big deal.
[01:28:43.591 --> 01:28:45.092]  New York Times admits it.
[01:28:45.092 --> 01:28:50.775]  Jeff Bezos, $600 million from the CIA to put out propaganda through his platforms.
[01:28:50.775 --> 01:28:52.856]  That's the Atlantic Magazine, all of it, admitted.
[01:28:52.856 --> 01:28:57.099]  All the articles where they admit that they have legalized fake news against Alex Jones with the CIA.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:06.025]  I mean, you got a bunch of leftist and weirdos and Ivy League kids who've got like a score to settle with America.
[01:29:06.025 --> 01:29:09.086]  And a score to settle with, you know, guys that are bigger and tougher than them.
[01:29:09.086 --> 01:29:10.287]  That's what this is.
[01:29:10.287 --> 01:29:11.228]  All this.
[01:29:11.228 --> 01:29:13.869]  I'm nothing against nerds, but this is ruled by nerds.
[01:29:13.869 --> 01:29:14.910]  They don't want prosperity.
[01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:23.155]  They want... Bill Gates wants you to sit there and take inoculations full of cancer viruses, see it roll over and die, and he just gets off on it, okay?
[01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:25.697]  I mean, that's what they do.
[01:29:25.697 --> 01:29:27.178]  And they're just total trash.
[01:29:28.644 --> 01:29:30.345]  They're your enemy.
[01:29:30.345 --> 01:29:33.226]  Like, why would somebody want to grab your cat out of the backyard and go torture him?
[01:29:33.226 --> 01:29:34.066]  It's just how they are.
[01:29:34.066 --> 01:29:35.086]  It's their nature.
[01:29:35.086 --> 01:29:37.647]  And those of us that aren't into that, we don't get it, okay?
[01:29:37.647 --> 01:29:43.469]  So, uh... The good news is... I'm gonna finish up with all this, go to your calls and a lot more.
[01:29:43.469 --> 01:29:48.291]  We have a special intro coming up that ties into a lot of things, so stay with us.
[01:29:48.291 --> 01:29:49.691]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.691 --> 01:29:52.212]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.212 --> 01:29:54.913]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.787 --> 01:30:03.209]  Ashley Beckford here for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:03.209 --> 01:30:06.772]  I have an article linked from the San Diego Tribune.
[01:30:06.772 --> 01:30:11.835]  North County Carlsbad to photograph every car entering city.
[01:30:11.835 --> 01:30:17.679]  Quote, to me, one million dollars is a drop in the bucket when you are trying to protect 100,000 or more people.
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:31.312]  Carlsbad is expanding its use of automatic license plate readers into a system that aims to collect the registration information of every vehicle that enters the city.
[01:30:31.312 --> 01:30:39.521]  The $1 million police department project, which will add stationary cameras at 14 key Carlsbad intersections,
[01:30:39.741 --> 01:30:52.772]  Creating a virtual gateway at the city's borders was approved by the city council last week, sparking outrage over privacy rights and government control from several residents and one council member.

[01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:56.272]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Longevity and the products at Infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[01:31:56.272 --> 01:31:57.572]  Check it out for yourself today.
[01:31:59.222 --> 01:32:07.210]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[01:32:07.210 --> 01:32:13.856]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:32:13.856 --> 01:32:22.144]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:32:22.404 --> 01:32:28.267]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[01:32:28.267 --> 01:32:31.429]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:32:31.429 --> 01:32:37.172]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:32:37.512 --> 01:32:38.272]  It works.
[01:32:38.272 --> 01:32:46.615]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[01:32:46.615 --> 01:32:56.477]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the globalists all at the same time.
[01:32:56.477 --> 01:33:00.419]  A total 360 win.
[01:33:00.419 --> 01:33:05.300]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:16.170]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum, who are beholden to scum!
[01:33:16.170 --> 01:33:18.573]  Russian scum!
[01:33:18.573 --> 01:33:21.216]  Listen to me.
[01:33:21.216 --> 01:33:26.542]  Please listen to me.
[01:33:26.542 --> 01:33:28.164]  If you don't, if you won't,
[01:33:29.178 --> 01:33:34.821]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[01:33:34.821 --> 01:33:38.963]  The function of all life is survival.
[01:33:38.963 --> 01:33:40.964]  Sleep.
[01:33:40.964 --> 01:33:42.945]  Sleep.
[01:33:42.945 --> 01:33:43.285]  Sleep.
[01:33:46.753 --> 01:33:47.974]  They're coming!
[01:33:47.974 --> 01:33:49.134]  They're coming!
[01:33:49.134 --> 01:33:49.835]  Help!
[01:33:49.835 --> 01:33:50.575]  Help!
[01:33:50.575 --> 01:33:51.496]  They're coming!
[01:33:51.496 --> 01:33:52.216]  They're coming!
[01:33:52.216 --> 01:33:53.177]  Listen to me!
[01:33:53.177 --> 01:33:53.637]  Listen!
[01:33:53.637 --> 01:33:54.978]  Help me!
[01:33:54.978 --> 01:33:55.538]  You're next!
[01:33:55.538 --> 01:33:56.218]  Please!
[01:33:56.218 --> 01:33:56.839]  Please!
[01:33:56.839 --> 01:33:57.339]  You're next!
[01:33:57.339 --> 01:33:58.400]  We're in danger!
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.300]  Please listen to me!
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.381]  It's something terrible!
[01:34:00.381 --> 01:34:01.341]  Please!
[01:34:01.341 --> 01:34:01.742]  You're next!
[01:34:01.742 --> 01:34:02.722]  You're the end!
[01:34:02.722 --> 01:34:04.563]  They're already here!
[01:34:04.563 --> 01:34:05.464]  Help!
[01:34:05.464 --> 01:34:06.044]  You're next!
[01:34:06.044 --> 01:34:06.704]  They're coming!
[01:34:06.704 --> 01:34:08.165]  They're coming!
[01:34:08.165 --> 01:34:08.986]  Sleep.
[01:34:08.986 --> 01:34:10.106]  The seed is planted.
[01:34:10.106 --> 01:34:12.067]  Sleep.
[01:34:12.067 --> 01:34:13.028]  Sleep.
[01:34:13.028 --> 01:34:14.149]  Terror grows.
[01:34:16.341 --> 01:34:17.922]  Get you when you sleep!
[01:34:17.922 --> 01:34:19.602]  Sit down!
[01:34:19.602 --> 01:34:23.223]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[01:34:23.223 --> 01:34:25.444]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[01:34:25.444 --> 01:34:26.664]  Is it contagious?
[01:34:26.664 --> 01:34:26.844]  Mom!
[01:34:26.844 --> 01:34:28.825]  Brianna, help me!
[01:34:28.825 --> 01:34:29.885]  It looked right at me.
[01:34:29.885 --> 01:34:30.685]  You need to get out!
[01:34:30.685 --> 01:34:32.166]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:35.166]  It was not human.
[01:34:35.166 --> 01:34:38.387]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[01:34:38.387 --> 01:34:40.628]  We're being cornered!
[01:34:40.628 --> 01:34:43.609]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[01:34:47.892 --> 01:34:49.073]  The body searches.
[01:34:49.073 --> 01:35:04.419]  What happens when fiction meets reality?
[01:35:04.419 --> 01:35:07.941]  The mob psychosis.
[01:35:09.562 --> 01:35:18.206]  And mass media programming creates a survival mass of programmable biological androids.
[01:35:18.206 --> 01:35:22.428]  This happens.
[01:35:22.428 --> 01:35:22.808]  The year is 2017.
[01:35:24.784 --> 01:35:33.311]  With the implosion of Hollywood, the state of California itself has entered a death spiral, and the communist Chinese have bought up the remnants.
[01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:43.418]  Out of this narcissistic hellhole now crawls millions upon millions of brain-damaged, culture-warped zombies.
[01:35:43.418 --> 01:35:51.785]  Tens of thousands of hours of screen time every year lowers their brainwaves into a sleep-like trance, where they can then be completely programmed
[01:35:52.225 --> 01:35:55.666]  But not just in Austin, Texas or Los Angeles, California.
[01:35:55.666 --> 01:36:05.789]  All over the country, we find that SJWs and trendies are unable to defend their political ideas and normally only cuss, scream, or howl.
[01:36:05.789 --> 01:36:11.110]  Very similar to what we saw in the 1970s remake of The Body Snatchers.
[01:36:11.110 --> 01:36:15.011]  Here is the incredibly frightening truth.
[01:36:15.011 --> 01:36:17.532]  What has been done to these people?
[01:36:17.532 --> 01:36:18.732]  This is mind control.
[01:36:20.282 --> 01:36:30.369]  Decades before parasitic spores had already found their way to Austin, the Austin Chronicle and Louis Black established South by Southwest.
[01:36:30.369 --> 01:36:35.172]  And like moths to a flame, they come to the new Hollywood.
[01:36:36.072 --> 01:36:44.580]  The unthinking Zomtrimioids are not escaping California, New York, and other wastelands to establish a new free outpost.
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:47.143]  They come to destroy the prosperity.
[01:36:47.143 --> 01:36:49.165]  They come seeking fame.
[01:36:49.165 --> 01:36:51.447]  They come to the new California outpost.
[01:36:51.887 --> 01:37:02.434]  A new place where dreams are stolen and destroyed by parasites that sit upon it, playing upon the hopes and dreams of the young, the gullible, and the stupid.
[01:37:02.434 --> 01:37:09.998]  South by Southwest, the beautiful cancer, now metastasizing through the once great city of Austin and spreading beyond.
[01:37:09.998 --> 01:37:13.881]  The anti-liberal workshops operate under the name of liberalism.
[01:37:14.521 --> 01:37:29.080]  The hopeless zombies pay high dollar to sit in the workshops and be taught that censorship is good, owning homes and cars is bad, and that renting from the big central megabanks is the ultimate expression of success.
[01:37:30.181 --> 01:37:42.706]  In short, South by Southwest in Austin, Texas is making slavery cool again and inducting the already scammed Californians and others into a new, even more wondrous fraud.
[01:37:42.706 --> 01:37:52.150]  Agenda 21 is the process of drawing humans out of their normal environment and putting them into artificial environments where they can be surveilled, controlled, and socially engineered.
[01:37:52.430 --> 01:38:10.315]  For as the final aim of the one-world technocracy, mass population reduction, and the new utopia of the elite on the now depopulated planet, we give you Austin, Texas, the new example of fraud and corruption.
[01:38:10.315 --> 01:38:19.498]  That video just went up, Gen21 Cancer, on Infowars.com, and it's also on the Alex Jones Channel.
[01:38:20.891 --> 01:38:22.552]  So please spread that to everyone you know.
[01:38:22.552 --> 01:38:26.034]  Facebook it, get it out on Twitter because they're blocking us more and more.
[01:38:26.034 --> 01:38:27.835]  But experience the blocking for yourself.
[01:38:27.835 --> 01:38:31.958]  We need to fund this operation and everything I do is a win-win.
[01:38:31.958 --> 01:38:33.799]  My dad is a dentist and oral surgeon.
[01:38:33.799 --> 01:38:37.601]  About to retire hopefully, but he works with us some.
[01:38:37.601 --> 01:38:41.984]  And he worked with the biggest anti-fluoride, fluoride-free toothpaste maker in the country.
[01:38:41.984 --> 01:38:42.884]  Everybody knows their name.
[01:38:42.884 --> 01:38:46.907]  Named after a state up north, but we're private labels.
[01:38:46.907 --> 01:38:48.788]  We're not supposed to say where we get it manufactured by.
[01:38:49.744 --> 01:38:51.185]  That's high quality.
[01:38:51.185 --> 01:38:56.449]  But we have added colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:38:56.449 --> 01:38:59.711]  It's got 4.8 reviews by the hundreds.
[01:38:59.711 --> 01:39:00.531]  Super blue!
[01:39:00.531 --> 01:39:02.232]  Now back in stock, a limited run.
[01:39:02.232 --> 01:39:05.475]  Believe me, I want to be able to get more of it, but we're having issue with the tubes.
[01:39:05.475 --> 01:39:06.675]  We may change the tubes we're getting.
[01:39:06.675 --> 01:39:10.298]  It's made with all natural ingredients.
[01:39:10.298 --> 01:39:11.038]  Very, very high quality.
[01:39:11.038 --> 01:39:12.439]  People absolutely love it.
[01:39:12.439 --> 01:39:13.420]  And you can get it as low as $8.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:17.863]  It costs us like $3 or $4 a tube, so we need to make a few bucks on this to fund the operation.
[01:39:19.022 --> 01:39:20.963]  Because you have to do your own runs.
[01:39:20.963 --> 01:39:25.085]  As we expand the amount we produce, it may go down in price, obviously, as we scale up.
[01:39:25.085 --> 01:39:26.085]  But it's still a great price.
[01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:27.246]  You help fund the operation.
[01:39:27.246 --> 01:39:30.247]  You can get it even less expensive if you order it in bulk.
[01:39:30.247 --> 01:39:34.589]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:40.955]  Back in stock, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:39:40.955 --> 01:39:45.162]  And soon we're going to have the bubblegum flavor in for kids, because this is pretty strong toothpaste.
[01:39:45.162 --> 01:39:46.204]  It's concentrated as well.
[01:39:46.204 --> 01:39:49.109]  A little pea-sized works when you usually have to, you know, load your...
[01:39:50.325 --> 01:39:53.448]  Loads your brush up with other types.
[01:39:53.448 --> 01:39:55.330]  So this has the Iodine Nano Silver.
[01:39:55.330 --> 01:39:56.511]  It's amazing.
[01:39:56.511 --> 01:40:01.796]  Four ounces of its big tube and it's made right here in America.
[01:40:01.796 --> 01:40:03.057]  It's high quality.
[01:40:03.057 --> 01:40:04.458]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:08.582 --> 01:40:13.810]  The bubblegum flavor will not have the tea tree oil and reduces the amount of peppermint in it because it is strong.
[01:40:13.810 --> 01:40:14.391]  It's concentrated.
[01:40:14.391 --> 01:40:18.978]  I mean, I've got, you know, a pretty strong palate and I like it, but it's still strong for me.
[01:40:18.978 --> 01:40:21.902]  So, not probably good for the young'uns.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.941]  We got a bunch of complaints, you know, five, six months ago when this first came out.
[01:40:26.941 --> 01:40:30.201]  And so, we went back to the drawing board, came up with bubble gum flavor for the kids.
[01:40:30.201 --> 01:40:31.682]  Still a really good toothpaste.
[01:40:31.682 --> 01:40:39.943]  That is, still got the cloyal silver, still got the iodine, just has reduced peppermint and no tea tree oil in the new one that's coming out.
[01:40:39.943 --> 01:40:43.084]  We've got some other formulas that we're coming up with as well.
[01:40:43.084 --> 01:40:43.784]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:43.784 --> 01:40:44.784]  I coined the term ZOM trimbioids.
[01:40:52.206 --> 01:40:54.267]  They're artificially arrested development.
[01:40:54.267 --> 01:40:56.107]  They're very scared.
[01:40:56.107 --> 01:40:58.548]  They don't normally go outside their houses a lot.
[01:40:58.548 --> 01:41:07.671]  I like the Hank Hill episode where Bobby talks about this kid that's on computers all the time, how much he loves him, and he goes and opens the door and the kid actually has like green skin like an alien.
[01:41:07.671 --> 01:41:15.313]  There are folks every week I see in the news dying, staying up two, three days, drinking, you know, caffeine drinks, trying to play video games.
[01:41:15.313 --> 01:41:17.954]  I mean, they're killing themselves for something that's a fantasy.
[01:41:17.954 --> 01:41:21.075]  And I'm not knocking you if you play video games.
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:24.561]  It's like, hey, do you have one glass of wine or three bottles of wine?
[01:41:24.561 --> 01:41:25.721]  Everything in moderation.
[01:41:25.721 --> 01:41:26.902]  I play video games, too, sometimes.
[01:41:26.902 --> 01:41:30.543]  But I tend to go to an arcade or something and do it.
[01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:32.243]  They kind of brought those back.
[01:41:32.243 --> 01:41:33.884]  Like the old-fashioned ones.
[01:41:33.884 --> 01:41:40.466]  It's just that when it takes over your life, it's an admitted false reality, an alternate reality that you've been sucked into, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:40.466 --> 01:41:45.988]  I know I preach to the choir, to our regular audience, but these are very, very important issues we raise.
[01:41:45.988 --> 01:41:49.029]  Separately, my Patriot Supply only started eight years ago.
[01:41:50.205 --> 01:41:54.567]  It's now the number one or number two largest storable foods company in the United States.
[01:41:54.567 --> 01:41:55.047]  And why is that?
[01:41:55.047 --> 01:41:56.028]  Because they're high quality.
[01:41:56.028 --> 01:41:59.089]  They bought up a lot of other big companies and they've got the lowest prices.
[01:41:59.089 --> 01:42:03.031]  We sell their entire catalog every day updated to whatever their latest specials are.
[01:42:03.031 --> 01:42:06.132]  We drop ship right from Utah where they produce it.
[01:42:06.132 --> 01:42:11.455]  When you do M4 Select, I called them about three years ago and I said, I want to go even below your best sales.
[01:42:11.455 --> 01:42:13.676]  So I have to wait till they have sales under contract.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:15.761]  And they said, no.
[01:42:15.761 --> 01:42:18.343]  And later I said, I'm going to leave to another company, even though you're great.
[01:42:18.343 --> 01:42:23.647]  There's a few other good ones, because I want to sell stuff even lower and only make like 15% on this when I do a special.
[01:42:23.647 --> 01:42:29.051]  And they said, well, we have deals with our other distributors, and the only way is for you to private label.
[01:42:29.051 --> 01:42:30.992]  Then you can contractually do it.
[01:42:30.992 --> 01:42:35.896]  But they said, we still want you to sign a contract to only do it twice a year, because Alex, it's already so low priced.
[01:42:35.896 --> 01:42:39.699]  And I said, you know what?
[01:42:39.699 --> 01:42:40.559]  I did it a few times.
[01:42:41.502 --> 01:42:44.024]  And the biggest sales I've ever had helped fund our operation.
[01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:46.306]  That's a small profit per unit, but it doesn't matter.
[01:42:46.306 --> 01:42:47.426]  You get a great deal.
[01:42:47.426 --> 01:42:50.809]  You sell more than it funds the operation.
[01:42:50.809 --> 01:42:55.672]  Well, I basically, as they're great folks, have gotten to where I can do this every two months for only two days.
[01:42:55.672 --> 01:43:00.816]  And I twist their arm for a couple extra days until there are other distributors who I'm sorry being greedy.
[01:43:00.816 --> 01:43:01.597]  You should do what I'm doing.
[01:43:02.881 --> 01:43:03.301]  We're good to go.
[01:43:21.636 --> 01:43:23.319]  You know, 25% on the 40% off.
[01:43:23.319 --> 01:43:26.303]  And that's enough to fund us when we dominate and sell a ton of it.
[01:43:26.303 --> 01:43:27.925]  So, it lasts 25 years.
[01:43:27.925 --> 01:43:29.007]  It's the best quality out there.
[01:43:29.007 --> 01:43:32.252]  They got specialty foods, specialty diets, all sorts of great stuff.
[01:43:32.252 --> 01:43:33.133]  It's amazing.
[01:43:33.133 --> 01:43:34.515]  It's insurance you can eat.
[01:43:34.515 --> 01:43:37.559]  30-40% off if you're thinking about it with North Korea threatening nuclear war and...
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:44.963]  You know, all these different European countries activating their bomb shelters for war with Russia, knowing that the globalists may start a big war.
[01:43:44.963 --> 01:43:46.804]  It's just smart to have this.
[01:43:46.804 --> 01:43:48.184]  Show yourself sufficient.
[01:43:48.184 --> 01:43:50.585]  And if things go south, you've got real insurance.
[01:43:50.585 --> 01:43:53.486]  You know, FDIC insurance, can't count on that with your bank accounts.
[01:43:53.486 --> 01:43:55.627]  Can't count on insurance if stuff really goes bad.
[01:43:55.627 --> 01:43:56.808]  They call it act of God.
[01:43:56.808 --> 01:44:00.509]  A storable food and stuff like that is something you can use.
[01:44:00.509 --> 01:44:03.130]  A shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive.
[01:44:03.130 --> 01:44:04.411]  I live back in the woods, you see.
[01:44:04.411 --> 01:44:06.412]  Woman, the dog, the kids, and me.
[01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:10.652]  So, this is something good for everybody to have.
[01:44:10.652 --> 01:44:16.416]  And I got a cabin out in the woods full of this stuff, and my house right in town's got it as well.
[01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:22.461]  I'm not living in fear, I'm living like a man who's supposed to be prepared and ready for his family.
[01:44:22.461 --> 01:44:26.024]  I don't wear a 9mm on my hip now, because I'm living in fear.
[01:44:26.024 --> 01:44:29.226]  I'm gonna not sit there and just totally roll over.
[01:44:29.226 --> 01:44:33.749]  And we're in a dangerous climate now, so for the first time in my life, I'm carrying a handgun.
[01:44:33.749 --> 01:44:34.550]  Pretty much all the time.
[01:44:37.759 --> 01:44:37.939]  I think?
[01:45:01.118 --> 01:45:02.098]  Best to wear it in.
[01:45:02.098 --> 01:45:03.259]  It's the best system.
[01:45:03.259 --> 01:45:05.479]  Get the same price you get at Defender.
[01:45:05.479 --> 01:45:07.280]  And it makes everything we do here possible.
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:08.680]  So please shop with the good guys.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.580]  Defender Body Armor.
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:10.701]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:45:10.701 --> 01:45:14.002]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:14.002 --> 01:45:14.642]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:14.642 --> 01:45:17.903]  Now, it's about a third as thick.
[01:45:17.903 --> 01:45:19.103]  It stops rifle rounds.
[01:45:19.103 --> 01:45:22.164]  But we were shooting it with rifle rounds.
[01:45:22.164 --> 01:45:23.884]  And with .500 Smith & Wesson.
[01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:26.025]  That's the biggest handgun round there is.
[01:45:26.025 --> 01:45:27.646]  And it didn't go through it.
[01:45:27.646 --> 01:45:28.666]  So it's joke level.
[01:45:29.594 --> 01:45:30.075]  How good it is.
[01:45:30.075 --> 01:45:39.464]  We also have the Nanotech, developed in Texas, manufactured in America, I guess built out in New Mexico, that is just as good for the similar price, maybe a tad bit more.
[01:45:39.464 --> 01:45:41.906]  And there we are shooting with a Smith & Wesson 500.
[01:45:41.906 --> 01:45:44.649]  I knocked a buffalo over one of those.
[01:45:44.649 --> 01:45:46.070]  Oh yeah, you still hunt buffalo?
[01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:48.232]  I'll show you the 500.
[01:45:48.232 --> 01:45:50.054]  Anyways, got the steaks in the refrigerator.
[01:45:50.054 --> 01:45:50.855]  I've already eaten most of it.
[01:45:50.855 --> 01:45:52.697]  Hell, the office has been eating that buffalo for three months.
[01:45:54.116 --> 01:46:08.220]  You go to a conservation place where they produce buffalo to put them out in the open range, and by hunting some and producing beef from them, it then helps them fund the operation to re-wild areas and put buffalo out in areas of Montana, Colorado, open range.
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.581]  So the average leftist is like, how dare you hunt a buffalo?
[01:46:10.581 --> 01:46:11.321]  They're almost extinct.
[01:46:11.321 --> 01:46:15.562]  Well, how about using hunting and then harvesting the beef to get high-quality lean beef?
[01:46:15.562 --> 01:46:16.163]  It's bovine.
[01:46:17.843 --> 01:46:21.386]  One buffalo you end up killing ends up more than 10.
[01:46:21.386 --> 01:46:30.594]  The place I go hunting sometimes, it's 8,000 acres, has sheep and things, bighorn sheep, that are in Europe that were only a couple hundred left a few years ago.
[01:46:30.594 --> 01:46:31.375]  They ended up getting them.
[01:46:31.375 --> 01:46:32.856]  Now there's thousands all over the world.
[01:46:32.856 --> 01:46:39.262]  So you hunt one, it's got a high dollar on it, and you're actually funding conservation to then put them back in Europe and other areas.
[01:46:40.708 --> 01:46:50.435]  I think it's sort of having that particular type, was it like, I forget the name, it's like a Ural sheep or some Caspian sheep, and you shoot it, and then they use that to then set them all over the world and repopulate them.
[01:46:50.435 --> 01:46:57.060]  But now, there's a bigger population in the U.S., I think we're saying like 15,000 or something, than there are back in the mountains of Eastern Europe.
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:59.862]  It's just crazy how it works, but that's the type of hunting I do.
[01:47:02.077 --> 01:47:05.038]  And it's amazing.
[01:47:05.038 --> 01:47:11.701]  It's amazing that the conservation that is involved and just how ignorant the left is.
[01:47:11.701 --> 01:47:19.444]  We got more white-tailed deer in Texas than we had a hundred years ago because of the conservation and the money that goes back into producing better genetics in them.
[01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:23.196]  I'm digressing, I'm sorry, I'm getting off on a whole other subject.
[01:47:23.196 --> 01:47:24.697]  Talk about real eugenics.
[01:47:24.697 --> 01:47:36.368]  That's going on with the production of the fish, the production of the deer, the Texas Parks and Wildlife has a lot of little commies that are at the low level, but high level, they got some good people that know what they're doing.
[01:47:36.368 --> 01:47:43.754]  Oh yeah, I can go hunt whitetail basically year-round if I want to, but there's a big price tag on it for conservation to then produce even more and better.
[01:47:45.765 --> 01:47:46.766]  People say, well why do you want to go hunt?
[01:47:46.766 --> 01:47:47.948]  Why tell them they don't have antlers on them?
[01:47:47.948 --> 01:47:50.090]  I don't go hunt them with the antlers.
[01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:52.073]  I don't care about the big trophy.
[01:47:52.073 --> 01:47:58.700]  I want to shoot a young doe because then I get that great healthy meat that I can make stews out of, steaks, you name it.
[01:47:59.650 --> 01:48:03.493]  If you're shooting some big buck in the rut with big old antlers, that doesn't taste good.
[01:48:03.493 --> 01:48:05.754]  Little news flash, everybody.
[01:48:05.754 --> 01:48:18.583]  But I am now digressing, ladies and gentlemen, into just basic primitive activity, which when you do these primitive activities, it opens up all these pathways in your brains, all these instincts that you've been trying to suppress.
[01:48:18.583 --> 01:48:21.906]  It's amazing how they put us in this artificial bubble.
[01:48:21.906 --> 01:48:24.067]  All right.
[01:48:24.067 --> 01:48:26.669]  So I've already spent an hour and 48 minutes
[01:48:28.584 --> 01:48:44.121]  On the epically huge announcement that Rand Paul's a Russian agent, I'm a Russian agent, I'm under investigation of being a Russian agent.
[01:48:44.121 --> 01:48:46.263]  That just shows how desperate they are.
[01:48:46.263 --> 01:48:47.625]  But here's the $64 trillion answer.
[01:48:49.904 --> 01:49:04.111]  They know the public isn't buying, and they made a big joke about it, that, oh, the Patriots won because the Russians did it, or David Rockefeller died because of the Russians, or Hillary fell down because of the Russians, or there was bad weather because of the Russians, or my tire went flat because of the Russians.
[01:49:04.111 --> 01:49:05.352]  They know nobody's buying that.
[01:49:06.721 --> 01:49:07.702]  They don't care.
[01:49:07.702 --> 01:49:24.217]  That's the excuse with the people in the deep state, in the shadow government, just the bureaucracy ignoring the law and the president, to then run around and prepare for his political overthrow and to leak information to the media, and then admit they leak it, then deny they leak it and say Trump's crazy and has been discredited.
[01:49:25.831 --> 01:49:38.637]  But other than this healthcare deal, which I know they came to Trump and they said the economy's going to implode, it's meant to kill the economy this year, if we don't repeal it at least and have some quasi-system, it's going to go crazy.
[01:49:38.637 --> 01:49:46.321]  And so he's listening to Paul Ryan, it's Trump's first mistake, and I think part of the new Gallup poll that's so low is fake, just like during the campaign it was fake.
[01:49:46.321 --> 01:49:47.061]  We told you it was fake.
[01:49:48.087 --> 01:49:56.509]  But you know, I'd say a third of his drop is real, because it's the first time he's deviated from his absolute promise to repeal Obamacare.
[01:49:56.509 --> 01:49:59.890]  I know he's going to hear everybody bitching and saying, well, a bunch of poor people don't have health care.
[01:49:59.890 --> 01:50:01.210]  Trump, talk to medical experts.
[01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:02.331]  They get it under charity care.
[01:50:02.331 --> 01:50:03.291]  They're not being told.
[01:50:03.291 --> 01:50:05.171]  The illegal aliens know there's charity care.
[01:50:05.171 --> 01:50:08.392]  They know you can't be turned away under law.
[01:50:08.392 --> 01:50:11.493]  But citizens play along that we're not supposed to get something for free.
[01:50:11.493 --> 01:50:13.253]  I'm not for stuff for free.
[01:50:13.253 --> 01:50:15.634]  But if it's there and already free, then go get it.
[01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:22.357]  Of course now it's up to 50% from 37.
[01:50:22.357 --> 01:50:26.067]  They just put these things out to bully the president, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:28.460]  And he shouldn't follow any of the polls.
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:30.841]  I want to take your calls on where do you see this going?
[01:50:30.841 --> 01:50:32.861]  How do we counter this?
[01:50:32.861 --> 01:50:37.442]  They wouldn't be confident putting this out unless they're planning military action.
[01:50:37.442 --> 01:50:40.182]  Clearly they're planning false flags to demonize the President.
[01:50:40.182 --> 01:50:41.022]  What would those be?
[01:50:41.022 --> 01:50:42.063]  We should talk about it.
[01:50:42.063 --> 01:50:47.444]  And clearly they're planning probes, bomb attacks, blueprints of Trump Tower, other things, trying to kill the President.
[01:50:47.444 --> 01:50:50.964]  We're in a war, a civil war for the Republic.
[01:50:50.964 --> 01:50:53.565]  The globalists that have hijacked the country are the enemy.
[01:50:53.565 --> 01:50:54.565]  They are the foreign power.
[01:50:55.761 --> 01:50:57.452]  We've got to rally the American people against it.
[01:50:59.099 --> 01:51:00.960]  Sick and tired of being sick and tired?

[01:54:17.522 --> 01:54:25.368]  I've probably done over the years 20 plus broadcasts with whistleblower nurses.
[01:54:25.368 --> 01:54:31.492]  Where they talk about how when they give the premature babies the vaccines they die.
[01:54:31.492 --> 01:54:36.235]  And so nurses started not doing it.
[01:54:36.235 --> 01:54:41.799]  But then under bioethics and under the insurance company edicts about six years ago they started saying you will do it.
[01:54:41.799 --> 01:54:45.362]  So they come in with the managing doctor and the administrators at these
[01:54:46.638 --> 01:54:54.083]  Hospitals, we've written articles about it, we've had guests on many times, and they give those preemies those shots, and a lot of them die on the spot.
[01:54:54.083 --> 01:54:56.384]  Some they can keep alive with respirators.
[01:54:56.384 --> 01:54:59.446]  Then they're horribly brain damaged.
[01:54:59.446 --> 01:55:10.653]  Now for government to be able to kill babies in front of their parents, but it's all done procedural, like they're the high priest, you don't know what's happening, that's real power.
[01:55:12.537 --> 01:55:19.000]  Like giving my grandmother her second round of polio vaccine, and then she got, a week later, the very vaccine they gave her, the very strain they gave her.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:25.123]  She just died a month ago or so.
[01:55:25.123 --> 01:55:28.185]  So, those are some important articles.
[01:55:28.185 --> 01:55:31.827]  You can actually talk to Rob Ducroux, he knows the interviews and the actual headlines.
[01:55:31.827 --> 01:55:37.930]  It was like, nurses admit babies die when given vaccines, or nurses tell Infowars about children
[01:55:38.902 --> 01:55:41.325]  Going into cardiac arrest or stopping breathing when they take vaccines.
[01:55:41.325 --> 01:55:44.048]  You can pull those articles up.
[01:55:44.048 --> 01:55:47.211]  But I wanted to hit this right now before I give the number out and take your calls.
[01:55:47.211 --> 01:55:49.274]  In the next hour it's 800-259-9231 on all the news we just covered.
[01:55:49.274 --> 01:55:49.334]  800-259-9231.
[01:55:49.334 --> 01:55:49.975]  Elmo has come out.
[01:55:58.533 --> 01:56:01.514]  Sesame Street introduces an autistic Muppet.
[01:56:01.514 --> 01:56:10.617]  Instead of asking why we've gone from 1 in 30,000 25 years ago to 1 in 58, and South Korea vaccinating more than us, we're like 1 in 27 now.
[01:56:10.617 --> 01:56:17.120]  Instead of asking why, it's just like, adopt it, be sweet about it, have local runs to raise money.
[01:56:18.578 --> 01:56:20.499]  For autistic research.
[01:56:20.499 --> 01:56:24.200]  Well, you give kids vaccines designed to cause an autoimmune response.
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:27.241]  It burns out their pancreas, it burns out their brain.
[01:56:27.241 --> 01:56:30.483]  When your kid has a convulsion, they're at the hospital or the clinic, they know it's that.
[01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:32.984]  It says on the insert, they say, oh, it's normal to have convulsions.
[01:56:32.984 --> 01:56:34.944]  They hope your kid comes back.
[01:56:34.944 --> 01:56:39.426]  Basically like electro shock therapy, as they call it, but with a chemical.
[01:56:39.426 --> 01:56:41.307]  The mercury causes an electrochemical response.
[01:56:43.971 --> 01:56:46.933]  So Sesame Street introduces a autistic Muppet.
[01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:51.416]  Notice a few years ago we had Elmo with the Surgeon General.
[01:56:51.416 --> 01:56:56.300]  Remember the Elmo actor ended up being a pedophile or reportedly got indicted or whatever?
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:59.442]  It just never ends.
[01:56:59.442 --> 01:57:03.905]  Get vaccinated with Surgeon General and Elmo.
[01:57:03.905 --> 01:57:06.227]  There's been a bunch of actors, I'm not saying they all were.
[01:57:06.227 --> 01:57:07.148]  So Sesame Street
[01:57:08.277 --> 01:57:10.798]  introduces Autistic Muppet.
[01:57:10.798 --> 01:57:13.919]  After their program of the IQ in the U.S.
[01:57:13.919 --> 01:57:17.340]  down about 15% in the last 20 years, it's going peaches.
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:22.481]  Here is Sesame Street introduces Autistic Muppet.
[01:57:22.481 --> 01:57:26.922]  Hi, Julia!
[01:57:26.922 --> 01:57:29.343]  Elmo!
[01:57:29.343 --> 01:57:32.564]  Elmo sees Julia is playing with her stuffed rabbit.
[01:57:34.113 --> 01:57:35.394]  Fluffster!
[01:57:35.394 --> 01:57:36.594]  Yeah!
[01:57:36.594 --> 01:57:39.355]  Fluffster's Jordy's favorite toy, right?
[01:57:39.355 --> 01:57:43.377]  Well, Elmo brought his favorite toy, too.
[01:57:43.377 --> 01:57:46.158]  I'm gonna come back here at the next hour and play both of these.
[01:57:46.158 --> 01:57:48.699]  You see, the globalists know that we adapt to being killed.
[01:57:48.699 --> 01:57:50.419]  We adapt to being poisoned.
[01:57:50.419 --> 01:57:51.780]  As long as we're shown it's okay.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:54.221]  So, like, everybody's got breast cancer and brain cancer now.
[01:57:54.221 --> 01:57:55.501]  All the kids are starting to get cancer.
[01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:56.882]  It's okay.
[01:57:56.882 --> 01:57:58.943]  Pediatric cancer, over 10,000 percent less.
[01:57:58.943 --> 01:57:59.523]  It's okay.
[01:58:00.612 --> 01:58:01.913]  It's okay.
[01:58:01.913 --> 01:58:04.395]  Just we're all in this together, all right?
[01:58:04.395 --> 01:58:08.239]  When you get a vodka, you know, give an extra dollar, you know, to Pink Research or whatever.
[01:58:08.239 --> 01:58:09.400]  Go to a restaurant, go wherever.
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.402]  It's like, give a dollar, give a dollar to find out the cure.
[01:58:12.402 --> 01:58:14.844]  How about why everybody's getting the cancer?
[01:58:14.844 --> 01:58:16.566]  So see, they normalize it.
[01:58:16.566 --> 01:58:19.148]  Oh, you're brain damaged now.
[01:58:19.148 --> 01:58:21.550]  It's okay.
[01:58:21.550 --> 01:58:25.053]  Zuckerberg and everybody needs the earth cleansed of you to enjoy the new future.
[01:58:26.349 --> 01:58:27.650]  None of them have screen time.
[01:58:27.650 --> 01:58:29.631]  None of them are allowed to watch television.
[01:58:29.631 --> 01:58:35.493]  None of their children, like Steve Jobs, are allowed to be online or have an iPad.
[01:58:35.493 --> 01:58:37.314]  They don't take vaccines either.
[01:58:37.314 --> 01:58:39.915]  But you and your children do.
[01:58:39.915 --> 01:58:40.696]  Do the right thing.
[01:58:40.696 --> 01:58:43.737]  Kill yourself and your children for Big Pharma.
[01:58:43.737 --> 01:58:45.738]  The Earth belongs to them.
[01:58:45.738 --> 01:58:46.819]  Submit.
[01:58:46.819 --> 01:58:47.379]  Assimilate.
[01:58:49.929 --> 01:58:51.490]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:51.490 --> 01:58:57.375]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:58:57.375 --> 01:58:59.938]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:58:59.938 --> 01:59:05.742]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:59:05.742 --> 01:59:14.450]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:20.398]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:59:20.398 --> 01:59:27.427]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:59:27.427 --> 01:59:31.993]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:59:32.253 --> 01:59:35.554]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:59:35.554 --> 01:59:37.635]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:37.635 --> 01:59:43.357]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:59:43.357 --> 01:59:45.777]  Check it out at PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:45.777 --> 01:59:51.379]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:51.379 --> 01:59:54.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.086 --> 02:00:09.928]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.928 --> 02:00:11.509]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.509 --> 02:00:13.050]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.050 --> 02:00:17.252]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.252 --> 02:00:21.314]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:36.946]  Humans not having empathy, not caring, not wondering why there's so many brain-damaged children, so many kids dying, and mentally from vaccines is what allows this to happen.
[02:00:36.946 --> 02:00:38.707]  Look at the articles on Drugs Report.
[02:00:38.707 --> 02:00:41.429]  Police, Chicago teen gang-raped on Facebook Live.
[02:00:41.429 --> 02:00:46.974]  40 viewers, cops not called.
[02:00:46.974 --> 02:00:54.740]  That's what allows scumbags like Pelosi and Maxine Waters to keep screwing everybody over.
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:57.322]  Our weakness is what empowers them.
[02:01:01.946 --> 02:01:07.290]  Now that the Democrats and Republicans announced smaller tax cuts as Trump battles, the stock market starts turning down.
[02:01:07.290 --> 02:01:08.171]  See?
[02:01:08.171 --> 02:01:12.795]  As soon as Trump began to compromise on health care, the magic ended.
[02:01:12.795 --> 02:01:22.362]  Only the purity was what was invincible.
[02:01:22.362 --> 02:01:24.224]  I mean, Trump's light year is better than Hillary.
[02:01:24.224 --> 02:01:26.726]  It's just, and I understand he wants to stabilize the economy, but wow.
[02:01:27.506 --> 02:01:32.647]  Back to Sesame Street introduces Autistic Muppet after Elmo tells you to go out and get vaccinated.
[02:01:32.647 --> 02:01:34.187]  So first Elmo tells you to go out and get vaccinated.
[02:01:34.187 --> 02:01:37.728]  Then your brain damaged and Elmo comes over and says, oh it's okay, I got a teddy bear.
[02:01:37.728 --> 02:01:40.528]  We'll put it in the uh, casket with you.
[02:01:40.528 --> 02:01:44.229]  Here it is.
[02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:47.150]  Oink, oink, oink, oink.
[02:01:47.150 --> 02:01:48.050]  Oh, what's wrong?
[02:01:48.050 --> 02:01:48.470]  Hi, Julia!
[02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:51.290]  You want to put the teddy bear in the casket with you?
[02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:53.191]  Oh, the vaccine didn't kill you.
[02:01:53.191 --> 02:01:53.631]  Too bad.
[02:01:55.777 --> 02:01:56.837]  Fluffster!
[02:01:56.837 --> 02:01:57.197]  Yeah!
[02:01:57.197 --> 02:02:00.999]  Fluffster's Julia's favorite toy, right?
[02:02:00.999 --> 02:02:04.399]  Well, Elmo brought his favorite toy, too!
[02:02:04.399 --> 02:02:05.440]  Oh, you can't talk!
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.540]  You did what I told you!
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:08.301]  I talk like I'm John Eel!
[02:02:08.301 --> 02:02:08.701]  Hello!
[02:02:08.701 --> 02:02:10.201]  Now it's Baldwin!
[02:02:10.201 --> 02:02:14.342]  You've been very useful to me!
[02:02:14.342 --> 02:02:18.063]  We can play side-by-side like we do sometimes!
[02:02:18.063 --> 02:02:19.784]  My chemical weapon did good!
[02:02:21.909 --> 02:02:23.289]  Where's Baby David?
[02:02:23.289 --> 02:02:24.530]  Oh, he copies what she does.
[02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:27.890]  She doesn't find out why she's brain damaged.
[02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:28.731]  She did what he said!
[02:02:28.731 --> 02:02:30.131]  Where's Baby David?
[02:02:30.131 --> 02:02:33.932]  There's a guy with his arms in the puppet.
[02:02:33.932 --> 02:02:36.632]  It's a man trying to get your kids to go along with something.
[02:02:36.632 --> 02:02:38.273]  Isn't that creepy?
[02:02:38.273 --> 02:02:41.453]  Oh, look, I'm a toy creeping around a little girl.
[02:02:41.453 --> 02:02:44.014]  Sesame Street.
[02:02:44.014 --> 02:02:44.754]  Pervert Street.
[02:02:46.539 --> 02:02:50.861]  Peek-a-boo!
[02:02:50.861 --> 02:02:51.981]  You brain-damager, it's cute!
[02:02:51.981 --> 02:02:55.643]  There sure are lots of ways to play!
[02:02:55.643 --> 02:02:59.684]  Soon you'll all be like that, Tilly.
[02:02:59.684 --> 02:03:03.185]  Mow you all down with machine guns with the New World Order!
[02:03:03.185 --> 02:03:05.366]  Peek-a-boo!
[02:03:05.366 --> 02:03:05.646]  So cute!
[02:03:05.646 --> 02:03:06.907]  Take your cancer viruses!
[02:03:09.199 --> 02:03:10.120]  Aw, isn't that sweet?
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:14.205]  Oh, we need to fund that with taxpayer money, isn't it cute?
[02:03:14.205 --> 02:03:16.647]  Get vaccinated with the Surgeon General and Elmo.
[02:03:16.647 --> 02:03:18.109]  Let's have a flashback of this.
[02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:19.891]  Phil, there it is.
[02:03:19.891 --> 02:03:20.532]  Hi!
[02:03:20.532 --> 02:03:23.074]  This is Elmo's friend, Dr. Murphy!
[02:03:23.074 --> 02:03:26.238]  He's the, um, the... I'm the Surgeon General, Elmo.
[02:03:26.238 --> 02:03:28.260]  It's my job to help everyone stay healthy.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:28.420]  Yes.
[02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:31.243]  Absolutely, Elmo.
[02:03:31.243 --> 02:03:33.506]  You can get all your vaccinations on time.
[02:03:33.506 --> 02:03:35.709]  Those are the shots that help you stay healthy.
[02:03:35.709 --> 02:03:37.071]  Shots?
[02:03:37.071 --> 02:03:37.752]  Don't worry, Elmo.
[02:03:37.752 --> 02:03:40.256]  It's just a little pinch and it's safe.
[02:03:40.256 --> 02:03:42.379]  And it's safe?
[02:03:42.379 --> 02:03:45.143]  And tell all your friends on Sesame Street to get vaccinated, too.
[02:03:47.128 --> 02:03:48.169]  That's not creepy.
[02:03:48.169 --> 02:03:49.489]  It's safe.
[02:03:49.489 --> 02:03:51.490]  They always say safe and effective.
[02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:52.751]  Read the insert.
[02:03:52.751 --> 02:03:56.533]  Every vaccine says it can kill you, cause neurological disorders, you name it.
[02:03:56.533 --> 02:03:57.573]  Doesn't matter though.
[02:03:57.573 --> 02:03:58.214]  He lied.
[02:03:58.214 --> 02:03:59.634]  He said Elmo.
[02:03:59.634 --> 02:04:03.156]  It's safe.
[02:04:03.156 --> 02:04:04.877]  Isn't it cute?
[02:04:04.877 --> 02:04:11.480]  And we all do what Bill Gates says because his dad ran Planned Parenthood and was the top eugenicist and the head of the Eugenics Society in the U.S.
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:14.382]  And he helped with his people set up the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[02:04:15.305 --> 02:04:16.365]  And you know how nice they were.
[02:04:16.365 --> 02:04:20.027]  I mean, you know, how Hitler.
[02:04:20.027 --> 02:04:23.448]  But then if you're actually fighting it, you see you're with Hitler.
[02:04:23.448 --> 02:04:30.511]  If you're actually against George Soros, like the forward said a few weeks ago, Alex loves Hitler.
[02:04:30.511 --> 02:04:33.632]  No quote, no link, doesn't matter.
[02:04:33.632 --> 02:04:35.373]  I love Hitler.
[02:04:35.373 --> 02:04:44.897]  No, it's you that love those that created Hitler as a trap to destroy the German people.
[02:04:48.146 --> 02:04:50.889]  Shame on... Shame on all you people.
[02:04:50.889 --> 02:04:54.053]  But you know where you're going, don't you?
[02:04:54.053 --> 02:04:56.797]  The same place David Rockefeller is.
[02:04:56.797 --> 02:04:57.397]  Even now.
[02:04:59.764 --> 02:05:07.830]  Judge Neil Gorsuch gave his opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday on the first day of hearings on his nomination to the U.S.
[02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:08.731]  Supreme Court.
[02:05:08.731 --> 02:05:23.122]  In it, he unpacked his views on the job of unelected judges in a democratic republic, giving his personal story and pledging to be a public servant who faithfully follows the Constitution and the laws enacted by the people's elected representatives.
[02:05:23.362 --> 02:05:37.095]  Judging is sometimes a lonely and hard job, Gorsuch mused in a wide-ranging speech that ranged from the dramatic to the humorous to reflections, at times showing deep passion and on two occasions even getting emotional.
[02:05:37.095 --> 02:05:43.881]  Today, Gorsuch sparred with Feinstein as well as other senators as they grilled him on his policies.
[02:05:44.201 --> 02:05:49.210]  It looks like that we're going to have a Supreme Court judge just like Antonin Scalia.
[02:05:49.210 --> 02:05:55.922]  Stay tuned to the Alex Jones Show at infowars.com slash show to follow the Senate hearings.
[02:05:59.349 --> 02:06:07.794]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:07.794 --> 02:06:20.721]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslive.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:06:20.721 --> 02:06:21.561]  Caveman.
[02:06:21.561 --> 02:06:28.745]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:29.045 --> 02:06:32.187]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:32.187 --> 02:06:37.349]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:37.349 --> 02:06:45.413]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:45.413 --> 02:06:53.337]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:53.337 --> 02:06:58.079]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[02:06:58.783 --> 02:06:59.604]  Hey, everyone!
[02:06:59.604 --> 02:07:01.886]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:07:01.886 --> 02:07:05.729]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:07:05.729 --> 02:07:07.811]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:07:07.811 --> 02:07:18.100]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:24.065]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:07:24.545 --> 02:07:39.462]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:07:39.502 --> 02:07:40.082]  I think so.
[02:08:09.076 --> 02:08:13.926]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:13.926 --> 02:08:15.369]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.221 --> 02:08:38.124]  So 12 years ago they began Gardasil trials in the United States.
[02:08:38.124 --> 02:08:44.328]  They had a bunch of deaths across the country of autoimmune disorders of 11 and 12 year old girls that were being given it.
[02:08:44.328 --> 02:08:46.089]  It was just all over local news.
[02:08:46.089 --> 02:08:46.810]  Hundreds of deaths.
[02:08:47.310 --> 02:08:51.492]  So they couldn't get it approved until Rick Perry, then governor, announced it was an emergency.
[02:08:51.492 --> 02:09:03.776]  So under federal law, if even a state governor announces an emergency, it gives it vaccine liability protection and that multi-billion dollar fund that was set up in 1983.
[02:09:03.776 --> 02:09:09.318]  And so I sat there and watched that with horror every week seeing more deaths.
[02:09:09.318 --> 02:09:14.620]  And you read the vaccine pieces of paper, the inserts that come with the actual ampule.
[02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:17.434]  And they always say on the news, safe and effective.
[02:09:17.434 --> 02:09:22.044]  They'll say it at the different clinics you go to or the different drugstores.
[02:09:22.044 --> 02:09:23.487]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[02:09:23.487 --> 02:09:24.509]  Safe and effective.
[02:09:24.509 --> 02:09:26.413]  Maybe a sore injection site.
[02:09:27.927 --> 02:09:41.713]  Then you read the MMR, or flu vaccine, or hepatitis vaccine, or any of them, and it's like neurological disorders, narcolepsy, type 1 diabetes by destroying your pancreas, death, autoimmune disorders.
[02:09:41.713 --> 02:09:46.675]  I mean, it's like small print, two giant, it's the size of a poster.
[02:09:46.675 --> 02:09:48.216]  It's just small print like Bible paper.
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:54.603]  In fact, I've got the file in there since we're on the subject now, since you guys raised this Elmo piece.
[02:09:54.603 --> 02:09:56.844]  I've got my vaccine file, people bring that in.
[02:09:56.844 --> 02:10:00.206]  I'll just show the MMR where it says it can kill you, neurological disorders.
[02:10:00.206 --> 02:10:07.209]  But they have the Surgeon General with Elmo saying, kids, it's totally safe, get your vaccines.
[02:10:07.209 --> 02:10:11.551]  Well, it's four or five, 30 years ago, now it's 50 something.
[02:10:11.551 --> 02:10:18.235]  And it's directly linked all over the world to death, you name it, neurological disorders, autoimmune responses, it's tainted with cancer viruses, you name it.
[02:10:19.838 --> 02:10:22.841]  But he just says safe and effective.
[02:10:22.841 --> 02:10:24.602]  In fact, he says it's just completely safe.
[02:10:24.602 --> 02:10:25.523]  Some creepy dude.
[02:10:25.523 --> 02:10:27.245]  Well, that was a few years ago.
[02:10:27.245 --> 02:10:38.575]  Now they've got, thank you, now they've got the new autistic Elmo kid that can't talk.
[02:10:38.575 --> 02:10:39.656]  Now there's bombshell.
[02:10:39.656 --> 02:10:42.899]  CDC commits a new vaccine, autism crime.
[02:10:42.899 --> 02:10:44.000]  Let's go over this here.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:44.461]  This is a
[02:10:45.759 --> 02:10:48.740]  Do a document cam shot for TV viewers, radio listeners, I'll read it to you.
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.300]  This is a Merck and Co.
[02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:50.640]  Inc.
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:54.202]  from one of their vaccines.
[02:10:54.202 --> 02:10:56.502]  Now you go to the drugstore and say, is there any side effects?
[02:10:56.502 --> 02:10:57.522]  No, none.
[02:10:57.522 --> 02:10:58.483]  Safe and effective.
[02:10:58.483 --> 02:11:00.623]  They'll give you a fake fact sheet.
[02:11:00.623 --> 02:11:02.784]  You need to ask with what comes with the ampule.
[02:11:02.784 --> 02:11:03.824]  The actual paper.
[02:11:03.824 --> 02:11:05.705]  Any drug has this, under law.
[02:11:05.705 --> 02:11:08.526]  They're trying to pass a law to get rid of these.
[02:11:08.526 --> 02:11:09.066]  And it says,
[02:11:13.342 --> 02:11:21.767]  Basically here, what it can do to you, and what is inside of the vaccine.
[02:11:21.767 --> 02:11:25.710]  And I'm telling you, it is a long, hard read.
[02:11:25.710 --> 02:11:32.194]  Pancreatitis, that's what kills your pancreas, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, endocrine system,
[02:11:34.048 --> 02:11:34.929]  Diabetes.
[02:11:34.929 --> 02:11:36.249]  So then it just kills your pancreas.
[02:11:36.249 --> 02:11:37.570]  It gives you diabetes.
[02:11:37.570 --> 02:11:42.113]  And the kids get the shot, they wonder why their pancreas fails, and then you wonder why the clinic's just full of the kids.
[02:11:42.113 --> 02:11:49.538]  Always at around August 15th, the clinics fill up nationwide because your pancreas is dying, or a few weeks later.
[02:11:49.538 --> 02:11:52.400]  Here, let's read some more here.
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:56.482]  Stephen Johnson Syndrome.
[02:11:56.482 --> 02:11:57.083]  Arrhythmia.
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:01.781]  Measles-like rash, because it gives you measles.
[02:12:01.781 --> 02:12:03.921]  You take the measles vaccine, you get measles.
[02:12:03.921 --> 02:12:05.362]  You take the shingles vaccines, you get it.
[02:12:05.362 --> 02:12:06.542]  But it's like this.
[02:12:06.542 --> 02:12:19.326]  So when Bill and Melinda Gates have 60,000 here, 100,000 there, a half million here, in some African country or in India, they say, oh, they had polio-like symptoms and thousands of children died.
[02:12:19.326 --> 02:12:23.747]  Which is a minor footnote, because Bill and Melinda Gates are so wonderful.
[02:12:23.747 --> 02:12:25.847]  Like my grandma getting polio after the vaccine.
[02:12:25.847 --> 02:12:27.348]  It's so wonderful.
[02:12:31.371 --> 02:12:32.652]  And it goes on and on here.
[02:12:32.652 --> 02:12:39.077]  You can just read all the brain damage, neurological disorders.
[02:12:39.077 --> 02:12:39.917]  It just goes on and on.
[02:12:39.917 --> 02:12:43.460]  I mean, I could just all day read these two if you'd like.
[02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:46.422]  Sometimes I feel like this is just all I should do on air, actually.
[02:12:46.422 --> 02:12:47.663]  Oh, Alex Jones is fake news.
[02:12:47.663 --> 02:12:49.244]  He says vaccines are bad.
[02:12:49.244 --> 02:12:53.847]  You can actually read all the stuff, influenza vaccine, all of it.
[02:12:53.847 --> 02:12:55.809]  Brain damage, narcolepsy, death.
[02:12:58.237 --> 02:13:01.938]  Yep, Gardasil linked to deaths and diabetes after young girls vaccinated.
[02:13:01.938 --> 02:13:02.999]  Toronto Star.
[02:13:02.999 --> 02:13:05.459]  Yeah, it turns off your immune system.
[02:13:05.459 --> 02:13:08.500]  Gardasil doesn't protect against any of the cancer viruses.
[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:12.722]  It is cancer viruses.
[02:13:12.722 --> 02:13:17.723]  That's a fact, Jack!
[02:13:17.723 --> 02:13:22.065]  I laugh because it's so sick.
[02:13:22.065 --> 02:13:25.546]  Chris, and Beth, and Carlos, and Michelle, and Lex, I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:13:26.559 --> 02:13:29.662]  If you just joined us, it's in the McClatchy, you name it, everywhere.
[02:13:29.662 --> 02:13:37.208]  Alex Jones and Infowars Breitbart under investigation for ties to Russia.
[02:13:37.208 --> 02:13:45.575]  A counter-espionage investigation of the FBI that we may be actually getting commands from Russia.
[02:13:45.575 --> 02:13:49.959]  Because we want control our borders, cut our taxes, have our guns, our private property.
[02:13:51.195 --> 02:13:53.555]  We want Trump to investigate the vaccines, which he's announcing.
[02:13:53.555 --> 02:13:57.676]  We're horrible, horrible, horrible people.
[02:13:57.676 --> 02:14:00.957]  And the word is, again, Trump's this big Russian agent too.
[02:14:00.957 --> 02:14:02.757]  And so is Rand Paul.
[02:14:02.757 --> 02:14:05.098]  You know what's funny?
[02:14:05.098 --> 02:14:07.338]  Rand Paul's only on the show when he calls me to come on.
[02:14:07.338 --> 02:14:10.819]  He's got to tell his staff he wants to go on.
[02:14:10.819 --> 02:14:14.440]  Not that I even need Rand Paul on the show.
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:15.980]  But he'll ask, why have I been on the show in years?
[02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:16.500]  What's going on?
[02:14:20.239 --> 02:14:24.405]  One time I got asked by one of his family members, hey, Rand's wondering why you never call him.
[02:14:24.405 --> 02:14:25.466]  Your people ignore us.
[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:34.782]  It's not like we need Rand Paul on the show, but, you know, he's being called a Russian agent, so am I now, Tucker Carlson, and we call their people and they just don't even return our phone call.
[02:14:34.782 --> 02:14:37.762]  So I'm communicating with Senator Rand Paul right now.
[02:14:37.762 --> 02:14:43.524]  Last time I mentioned this, he called a day later, and it was like, it was the same thing with Ted Nugent.
[02:14:43.524 --> 02:14:46.864]  I mean, I've got his cell phone number and his email, but I'm supposed to call his booker.
[02:14:46.864 --> 02:14:49.485]  He literally calls me once and says, hey, I've been on the show, why don't you ever call?
[02:14:49.485 --> 02:14:50.245]  Your people don't...
[02:14:51.092 --> 02:14:52.973]  Get back with Nico Acosta.
[02:14:52.973 --> 02:14:56.954]  But I want Senator Rand Paul on the show about this, and what do we do about this?
[02:14:56.954 --> 02:14:58.454]  He came out a few weeks ago about the health care bill.
[02:14:58.454 --> 02:14:59.115]  He was absolutely right.
[02:14:59.115 --> 02:15:00.175]  It's not a good idea.
[02:15:00.175 --> 02:15:03.836]  Better than Obamacare, but that doesn't mean something's like being shot with a bazooka or a .45.
[02:15:03.836 --> 02:15:05.597]  I don't want to be shot by either.
[02:15:05.597 --> 02:15:06.777]  I want this damn thing repealed.
[02:15:10.742 --> 02:15:14.223]  But that's just an example of the demonization that's going on.
[02:15:14.223 --> 02:15:16.224]  I've got a bunch of news in the economy, military.
[02:15:16.224 --> 02:15:20.326]  I want to get to Paul Watson's house in the fourth hour from London, England right now.
[02:15:20.326 --> 02:15:24.228]  Let's talk to a caller in Canada.
[02:15:24.228 --> 02:15:25.928]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carlos.
[02:15:25.928 --> 02:15:26.429]  You're on the air.
[02:15:26.429 --> 02:15:28.229]  Thanks for holding.
[02:15:28.229 --> 02:15:30.130]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:30.130 --> 02:15:32.731]  Before I give you a bit of a solution to this Russian
[02:15:34.617 --> 02:15:41.004]  Malarkey that's going on and the allegations against yourself and others I want to tell you we got some of your iodine product.
[02:15:41.004 --> 02:15:46.571]  That is really great stuff And we should I advise everyone who's listening to get it.
[02:15:46.571 --> 02:15:54.680]  It should be part of your medicine cabinet and people love people love testimonials We wanted to do for you It's well, it's actually
[02:15:55.504 --> 02:16:03.112]  Very solitary because, you know, we run down on iodine and it's something that people don't realize in western and northern latitudes.
[02:16:03.112 --> 02:16:09.299]  And unless you're taking vitamin D3 and you're really getting all the components.
[02:16:09.299 --> 02:16:14.885]  Don't forget iodine comes from the ocean and that's essential to all the living cells in our body.
[02:16:15.839 --> 02:16:17.461]  So if you don't have it, you die.
[02:16:17.461 --> 02:16:20.563]  And the other iodines are just toxic or they're bound.
[02:16:20.563 --> 02:16:26.389]  You know, these are, this is real 999999, deep earth, not ocean based, goes right into the blood.
[02:16:26.389 --> 02:16:29.972]  Uh, and it's in a palm oil organic system.
[02:16:29.972 --> 02:16:31.393]  It's, it's a speak of the devil.
[02:16:31.393 --> 02:16:34.436]  It's Russian patented technology, how they inject the gas in.
[02:16:34.436 --> 02:16:37.699]  Uh, but it's pretty amazing.
[02:16:37.699 --> 02:16:38.199]  All right.
[02:16:38.199 --> 02:16:41.282]  Now let me tell you how you can force them on their own petard.
[02:16:41.954 --> 02:16:58.085]  For about a year now, there's been, there was talk about that time of a movement to get rid of, not President Trump, because he wasn't at that time believed that he was going to be president, but the target was Vladimir Putin.
[02:16:58.085 --> 02:17:05.310]  He's going to be running again for election next year in the month of March, a year from now.
[02:17:05.310 --> 02:17:11.194]  And the plan was to mount a tremendous campaign with trouble from Ukraine.
[02:17:12.256 --> 02:17:19.300]  So that there will be infiltrations, terrorism, and new candidates very strongly supported by the neocons.
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:29.765]  And by the way, McCain and Soros and Hillary and Obama admitted that they have groups by the thousands of groups in Russia openly trying to overthrow their government.
[02:17:29.765 --> 02:17:29.925]  Yes.
[02:17:31.377 --> 02:17:32.138]  Correct.
[02:17:32.138 --> 02:17:45.856]  And so, if they can throw you in the mix, if they can prepare the American people to expect, and the Europeans, that the Russians are interfering with their elections, then it's payback time when they do it next January, December.
[02:17:46.237 --> 02:18:03.520]  Well sure, that's what's happening, and again, they can brand opposition to globalism, nationalists as foreigners, or out to get the nation state when it's the globalists killing our nation state, and they change the subject on how they lost the election, how they rigged the election, how they got caught lying, how they got caught rigging the media.
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:05.981]  I mean, it's actually a genius PR move.
[02:18:05.981 --> 02:18:13.122]  It's not really working though, so that's why they're sharpening their knives, and I think it's pretty sure fact they're going to try to kill the president.
[02:18:14.648 --> 02:18:29.291]  Well, I put it to you that every time they allege anything like you're an agent, or Roger Stone is an agent, or anyone is an agent, you bring up the subject that it is Putin that they're trying to get after next year.
[02:18:29.291 --> 02:18:34.632]  And as the time approaches, you'll see how quiet they go on allegations against people like yourselves.
[02:18:34.632 --> 02:18:40.193]  Because they will not want to bring this subject up week after week, month after month, all the way to March next year.
[02:18:40.193 --> 02:18:44.274]  Because they know that'll make Russians vote for him, realizing it's an outside force trying to stop that.
[02:18:44.967 --> 02:18:45.808]  Exactly.
[02:18:45.808 --> 02:18:53.116]  And also, it will encourage President Trump to be able to say, okay, now that we know what's going on... Well, Trump needs to trump this.
[02:18:53.116 --> 02:18:59.864]  He needs to meet with Putin immediately, make a big joke out of it, have Russia do some concessions just to totally defeat all this.
[02:18:59.864 --> 02:19:01.405]  I mean, this is a load of crap.
[02:19:01.946 --> 02:19:10.490]  I mean, this is so ridiculous that they sit here and try to sell this and, I mean, saying Rand Paul works for Putin?
[02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:12.271]  I mean, when's this going to end?
[02:19:12.271 --> 02:19:15.733]  When John McCain's been caught working with Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria?
[02:19:15.733 --> 02:19:19.695]  I mean, the guy is a total criminal.
[02:19:19.695 --> 02:19:24.837]  Well, they're not too intelligent, but they are really, really organized and they have a lot of money.
[02:19:24.837 --> 02:19:25.918]  Too much money, I believe.
[02:19:26.346 --> 02:19:27.567]  I agree, they're totally ruthless.
[02:19:27.567 --> 02:19:32.708]  I'll be honest with you, what scares me is Pelosi not knowing that Bush isn't president for eight years.
[02:19:32.708 --> 02:19:37.390]  Same press conference, Maxine Waters, uh, you know, thinks that Russia invaded Korea.
[02:19:37.390 --> 02:19:39.171]  She doesn't even know there's an other South.
[02:19:39.171 --> 02:19:41.372]  And I haven't gotten the clips last few weeks, I've been too busy.
[02:19:41.372 --> 02:19:45.973]  We've got all sorts of Space Cadet, Maxine Water, uh, Pelosi stuff.
[02:19:45.973 --> 02:19:51.375]  They get up there in press conferences, they literally act like Alzheimer patients, I know.
[02:19:51.375 --> 02:19:52.636]  And they're like the leaders
[02:19:53.703 --> 02:19:55.904]  Claiming Putin runs everything.
[02:19:55.904 --> 02:20:00.005]  Hell, they say Putin tells Trump, drain the swamp, crooked Hillary.
[02:20:00.005 --> 02:20:02.726]  As if we haven't been saying that for 20 plus years.
[02:20:02.726 --> 02:20:07.827]  I mean, it's just, it's like, she thinks we're like her constituents, I guess, that are dumbed down.
[02:20:07.827 --> 02:20:14.429]  She literally thinks we don't have an original thought in our head, and so if she doesn't know what planet she's on, she wonders, how could I know?
[02:20:14.429 --> 02:20:16.230]  Does that make sense?
[02:20:17.765 --> 02:20:19.125]  That makes a lot of sense.
[02:20:19.125 --> 02:20:36.931]  And yet, if you want to go back to the subject of Putin and his overthrow and the effort that the neocons are putting on, watch next month in France how they're going to be alleging that, you know, one way or the other, Russia is involved against the French and against elections interference.
[02:20:36.931 --> 02:20:38.111]  Watch.
[02:20:38.111 --> 02:20:38.932]  That will be the clue.
[02:20:38.932 --> 02:20:42.553]  Well, you sound like a smart guy, Carlos.
[02:20:42.553 --> 02:20:43.213]  What's your background?
[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:51.242]  I'm a PhD in Neuroscience, but I read between the leaves, the tea leaves.
[02:20:51.242 --> 02:20:54.823]  Well, since you're a neuroscientist, I'm just reading the inserts on these vaccines.
[02:20:54.823 --> 02:21:02.586]  What do you make of all the increase in neurological disorders and the claim that vaccines have zero bad health effects?
[02:21:02.586 --> 02:21:11.589]  I, you know, the model of having dead organisms and developing memories and immune systems against it,
[02:21:12.373 --> 02:21:15.776]  As a principle of vaccine is a good one.
[02:21:15.776 --> 02:21:30.046]  What I find is that across the board, it doesn't matter whether it's mortgages in the financial community, or whether it is, you know, vaccines in the medical models, or whether it is, you know, the truth in the media or religion.
[02:21:30.046 --> 02:21:34.890]  I find that there is an effort throughout the board, and even the food products that we consume.
[02:21:35.552 --> 02:21:42.951]  To abuse and to degenerate, adulterate the products in any way that is profitable.
[02:21:43.664 --> 02:21:45.044]  Medicines, etc.
[02:21:45.044 --> 02:21:47.985]  Regardless of what happens to society and... That's right.
[02:21:47.985 --> 02:21:54.126]  They're setting a precedent to lower standards to maximize profit and have the public accept crap.
[02:21:54.126 --> 02:21:58.107]  There's a war on quality, and whether it's a conspiracy or not, it's going on.
[02:21:58.107 --> 02:22:00.207]  And you read the white papers, it is a conspiracy.
[02:22:00.207 --> 02:22:02.807]  And that's why I go into a fast food place rarely.
[02:22:02.807 --> 02:22:04.088]  I leave the trash.
[02:22:04.088 --> 02:22:06.908]  That makes them go create jobs for entry level.
[02:22:06.908 --> 02:22:08.288]  We just accept less.
[02:22:08.288 --> 02:22:09.489]  That's the world they're building.
[02:22:09.489 --> 02:22:10.969]  And it goes right into medicine and everything else.
[02:22:11.269 --> 02:22:12.270]  Great call, Carlos.
[02:22:12.270 --> 02:22:13.690]  Just a final point.
[02:22:13.690 --> 02:22:22.916]  What do you make of them coming out, though, and saying they're criminally investigating me for being in contact with Russian intelligence agencies, which, of course, is like saying I'm Pinocchio or Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[02:22:22.916 --> 02:22:27.739]  It's total crap, unequivocally a fraud, makes me very, very angry that they're this desperate.
[02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:30.100]  What do you make of that?
[02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:35.303]  I make it that you should take paper and paper, pencil and paper, get a paper trail
[02:22:36.189 --> 02:22:44.135]  And with the law, sue anyone who dares this kind of unaccountability, abuse of respect.
[02:22:44.135 --> 02:22:44.716]  No, I agree.
[02:22:44.716 --> 02:22:47.058]  And they were having the Washington Post and the New York Times say it.
[02:22:47.058 --> 02:22:49.159]  They had to pull it because people were getting suits ready.
[02:22:49.159 --> 02:22:53.322]  Because clearly, you say somebody's a foreign agent with no evidence and you'll have to destroy somebody.
[02:22:53.322 --> 02:22:54.844]  And we should be shut down.
[02:22:54.844 --> 02:22:55.444]  Don't forget that.
[02:22:55.444 --> 02:22:56.325]  Because they want to shut us down.
[02:22:56.325 --> 02:23:00.748]  So they're saying like a gulag or something, you know, or a Nazi ghetto.
[02:23:00.748 --> 02:23:02.409]  You know, you'll put us in a ghetto.
[02:23:02.409 --> 02:23:04.011]  This is unprecedented in history.
[02:23:04.651 --> 02:23:11.153]  And so now they're having the Board of Governors and the CIA come out and do it in Congress as if they have immunity.
[02:23:11.153 --> 02:23:15.774]  And what's crazy is this is a law Obama signed a month before Trump got in.
[02:23:15.774 --> 02:23:17.054]  Trump needs to go kill this.
[02:23:17.054 --> 02:23:22.135]  But then his advisors are like, sir, if you kill the Russian monitoring program, they'll say you must be Russian.
[02:23:22.135 --> 02:23:22.835]  No!
[02:23:22.835 --> 02:23:25.776]  They've set up a Ministry of Truth to harass the free press.
[02:23:25.776 --> 02:23:29.077]  It's a freaking joke!
[02:23:29.077 --> 02:23:29.657]  It's a joke!
[02:23:31.243 --> 02:23:34.686]  You said something very profound in one of your programs that really touched me.
[02:23:34.686 --> 02:23:44.273]  And you said America cannot, Americans cannot be free until they have, they're free from being surveilled.
[02:23:44.273 --> 02:23:46.415]  And this is essential.
[02:23:46.415 --> 02:23:59.284]  If the only thing that President Trump does is to liberate Americans from being surveilled by being, you know, investigated or to be, it's like Uncle Sam became Peeping Tom.
[02:23:59.284 --> 02:24:00.045]  And it's so sad.
[02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:05.682]  And then they admit it all, and then Trump goes, it's illegal to leak that.
[02:24:05.682 --> 02:24:10.024]  They go, we didn't do it, we didn't do it, like there's not thousands of news articles with the headline.
[02:24:10.024 --> 02:24:13.866]  I mean, again, the insult of these people, the arrogance.
[02:24:13.866 --> 02:24:20.169]  I look at the weird cowards, like that weirdo on Reliable Sources, on CNN, like this little arrogant wimp.
[02:24:20.169 --> 02:24:21.889]  I'm not just saying that meanly.
[02:24:21.889 --> 02:24:24.891]  He looks like the most cowardly, pathetic person I've ever seen.
[02:24:24.891 --> 02:24:25.931]  He just radiates.
[02:24:25.931 --> 02:24:26.732]  He's a piece of crap.
[02:24:27.432 --> 02:24:30.674]  And I'm just like, how are we ruled by these people?
[02:24:30.674 --> 02:24:31.634]  God bless you, Carlos.
[02:24:31.634 --> 02:24:37.638]  I appreciate your call.
[02:24:37.638 --> 02:24:38.639]  Well, it means we're winning.
[02:24:38.639 --> 02:24:40.800]  And I knew when we got Trump in, the war had just started.
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:45.022]  My gut told me when he was elected, I said, oh my God.
[02:24:45.022 --> 02:24:46.403]  And I was told by a lot of smart folks, too.
[02:24:46.403 --> 02:24:53.147]  They said, Alex, they said next level's the real fight.
[02:24:54.915 --> 02:24:56.436]  And I don't even care about myself.
[02:24:56.436 --> 02:24:58.278]  And I say that selfishly.
[02:24:58.278 --> 02:24:59.178]  I've already died.
[02:24:59.178 --> 02:25:03.382]  You know, you get older as a man, you just, you know, it's like, it's not even confidence anymore.
[02:25:03.382 --> 02:25:04.162]  You just don't care.
[02:25:04.162 --> 02:25:10.787]  But then I think about children and it makes me sick.
[02:25:10.787 --> 02:25:15.231]  What they do to little kids with the vaccines, what they do to little kids with all the rest of it, and they know what they're doing.
[02:25:15.231 --> 02:25:21.515]  And it's always, somebody looks like a pedophile pushing, and it's always some weird demon creature.
[02:25:21.515 --> 02:25:21.976]  And I just,
[02:25:24.338 --> 02:25:25.058]  I just know this.
[02:25:25.058 --> 02:25:28.039]  They start a civil war, I'm not going after the poor cops.
[02:25:28.039 --> 02:25:31.700]  They're just like the citizens, misdirected, brainwashed.
[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:34.120]  They start killing patriots and everybody else.
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:38.162]  We need to know, all of us know who the enemy is in your area.
[02:25:38.162 --> 02:25:40.902]  The people that are running this stuff.
[02:25:40.902 --> 02:25:45.103]  Because as soon as they get in a physical fight, that they start.
[02:25:45.103 --> 02:25:47.544]  Remember, we don't ever do something offensive.
[02:25:47.544 --> 02:25:51.865]  But as soon as they step into that arena, it's important they get hammered hard.
[02:25:54.775 --> 02:26:03.741]  And they take those of us that have restraint, big governors, because we got big machines, genetically.
[02:26:03.741 --> 02:26:04.482]  I'm a builder.
[02:26:04.482 --> 02:26:05.683]  I'm also a killer.
[02:26:05.683 --> 02:26:08.244]  I mean, I'm not, I mean, flip a switch.
[02:26:08.244 --> 02:26:12.588]  I mean, it's, it's, it's bad.
[02:26:12.588 --> 02:26:17.551]  And I see these wimps living that world.
[02:26:17.551 --> 02:26:18.512]  They've never actually been in it.
[02:26:18.512 --> 02:26:20.453]  They haven't even, they don't have the genetics for it.
[02:26:20.453 --> 02:26:22.755]  They have the genetics to creep around all day and stab people in the back.
[02:26:22.755 --> 02:26:24.196]  And they're trying to start fights with people.
[02:26:25.453 --> 02:26:27.073]  Because they've got this little evil side.
[02:26:27.073 --> 02:26:27.734]  They don't have a good side.
[02:26:27.734 --> 02:26:33.635]  They've got this evil... There's people that have giant evil sides because their good sides are so much even huger than that.
[02:26:33.635 --> 02:26:41.156]  And they're sitting there starting fights with people that... that they would be so horrified of.
[02:26:41.156 --> 02:26:43.837]  They think they're horrified of good people because we're good.
[02:26:43.837 --> 02:26:45.337]  They don't know why they're horrified.
[02:26:45.337 --> 02:26:51.018]  They're horrified because they worship evil and our evil side is so much bigger and more evil than their side.
[02:26:51.018 --> 02:26:53.059]  It's just counter-veiled by the good.
[02:26:55.171 --> 02:26:58.534]  So if you want to open the gates, open the gates.
[02:26:58.534 --> 02:27:00.195]  Open them at your peril.
[02:27:00.195 --> 02:27:01.856]  You don't care.
[02:27:01.856 --> 02:27:11.083]  Scum never cares until the cold fingers are wrapped around their neck.
[02:27:11.083 --> 02:27:17.008]  We're ruled by mentally retarded people like Pelosi and Michael Moore.
[02:27:17.008 --> 02:27:19.790]  And it's our fault they're in power and it needs to change.
[02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:24.854]  And we need to do everything peaceful now while the sun still shines to change the paradigm.
[02:27:26.698 --> 02:27:29.020]  What I'm saying is, I know a lot of you think we're winning.
[02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:30.201]  We're in the fight now.
[02:27:30.201 --> 02:27:31.142]  We're not winning.
[02:27:31.142 --> 02:27:33.343]  The war is now.
[02:27:33.343 --> 02:27:35.045]  Michael in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:27:35.045 --> 02:27:37.246]  Go ahead.
[02:27:37.246 --> 02:27:38.347]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:27:38.347 --> 02:27:38.768]  Good, brother.
[02:27:38.768 --> 02:27:42.330]  Oh man, I got a couple things to talk to you about.
[02:27:42.330 --> 02:27:44.392]  First things start off, Roger Stone.
[02:27:44.392 --> 02:27:46.794]  What the heck is Pelosi doing with this Schiff guy?
[02:27:46.794 --> 02:27:50.257]  She put this guy in power and now he's putting all this political crap out in the air.
[02:27:52.096 --> 02:27:57.122]  Yeah, Schiff looks like the creepiest person I've ever seen with those little weirdo bug-eyed things.
[02:27:57.122 --> 02:27:58.083]  He's got going all the crap.
[02:27:58.083 --> 02:27:59.345]  Everybody's a Russian agent.
[02:27:59.345 --> 02:28:01.667]  How about you're an agent of the Communist Chinese, jerk?
[02:28:01.667 --> 02:28:03.890]  The Democratic Party's run by them.
[02:28:03.890 --> 02:28:05.112]  Exactly.
[02:28:05.112 --> 02:28:06.093]  Run his mouth everywhere.
[02:28:06.093 --> 02:28:06.854]  You're a Russian agent.
[02:28:06.854 --> 02:28:08.536]  You're a Russian agent.
[02:28:08.536 --> 02:28:09.817]  They're the traitors against this country.
[02:28:09.817 --> 02:28:10.238]  What do you think?
[02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:18.123]  I think he's completely a traitor and he's one of our biggest battles in our spiritual war that we're doing here.
[02:28:18.123 --> 02:28:22.588]  And like you just said about the evil about the good, I think you're a little wrong on that.
[02:28:22.588 --> 02:28:26.792]  I think our good is so much stronger than their evil.
[02:28:26.792 --> 02:28:31.317]  No, I'm not saying it's some balanced New Age thing, good and evil, it's the opposite.
[02:28:31.317 --> 02:28:32.818]  I'm saying most good people
[02:28:34.036 --> 02:28:40.243]  out there have a vicious side to them, but it's governed by the good and the fact they love God.
[02:28:40.243 --> 02:28:44.648]  That a lot of good people, though, the evil people are trying to be evil, trying to be powerful.
[02:28:44.648 --> 02:28:46.891]  They have no idea that it's good that's more powerful.
[02:28:46.891 --> 02:28:53.619]  I'm just saying they worship evil, and they have no idea, according to their paradigm of evil, the capabilities of what a good person can do.
[02:28:55.009 --> 02:28:58.890]  Agreed, but you gotta realize most of these people don't even know they're evil.
[02:28:58.890 --> 02:29:07.533]  They're so brainwashed by this television that they're watching every single day and they don't even realize they're being told that evil is good and good is evil and they're starting to believe it.
[02:29:07.533 --> 02:29:14.695]  Well you look at Chef just by his actions but his look in his eyes, that is a super bad news person.
[02:29:14.695 --> 02:29:16.216]  Agreed, but what can we do for Stone?
[02:29:16.216 --> 02:29:17.516]  Is there anything we can help him with?
[02:29:18.061 --> 02:29:21.982]  No, he's having the time of his life fighting them and knows it's all crap and they might try to kill him.
[02:29:21.982 --> 02:29:23.043]  They've already tried to kill him twice.
[02:29:23.043 --> 02:29:24.463]  He's actually coming up in 10 minutes.
[02:29:24.463 --> 02:29:27.904]  But Mike, let me come back and let you finish your point about the Comey hearing, because I cut into you.
[02:29:27.904 --> 02:29:34.266]  Then I'm going to go to Lex, Chris, Beth and others, then Wilde, then Roger Stone just as an update is going to pop in, because I now joined the club.
[02:29:34.266 --> 02:29:36.247]  I mean, they've said I'm like influenced by Roger Stone.
[02:29:36.247 --> 02:29:46.790]  I'm under investigation by the counter espionage unit of the FBI for being under the control of Russian intelligence.
[02:29:48.274 --> 02:29:52.223]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.223 --> 02:29:54.909]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.634 --> 02:30:03.076]  Ashley Beckford here for InfoWars.com.
[02:30:03.076 --> 02:30:06.618]  I have an article linked from the San Diego Tribune.
[02:30:06.618 --> 02:30:11.680]  North County Carlsbad to photograph every car entering city.
[02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:17.463]  Quote, to me, one million dollars is a drop in the bucket when you are trying to protect 100,000 or more people.
[02:30:19.244 --> 02:30:31.158]  Carlsbad is expanding its use of automatic license plate readers into a system that aims to collect the registration information of every vehicle that enters the city.
[02:30:31.158 --> 02:30:39.388]  The $1 million police department project, which will add stationary cameras at 14 key Carlsbad intersections,
[02:30:39.608 --> 02:30:52.601]  Creating a virtual gateway at the city's borders was approved by the city council last week, sparking outrage over privacy rights and government control from several residents and one council member.
[02:30:52.601 --> 02:30:56.745]  Stay tuned for more special reports at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:59.130 --> 02:31:07.397]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[02:31:07.397 --> 02:31:08.618]  A 360 win.
[02:31:08.618 --> 02:31:15.184]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at Infowarshore.com.
[02:31:15.184 --> 02:31:22.710]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:27.772]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:31:27.772 --> 02:31:34.276]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:31:34.276 --> 02:31:42.080]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:49.283]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:31:49.283 --> 02:31:50.084]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:31:50.484 --> 02:31:52.686]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:52.686 --> 02:31:54.668]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[02:31:54.668 --> 02:31:59.052]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:31:59.052 --> 02:32:07.501]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:32:07.501 --> 02:32:09.002]  We are now introducing cavemen.
[02:32:09.162 --> 02:32:20.430]  By Infowarsline.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[02:32:20.430 --> 02:32:21.270]  Caveman.
[02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:26.334]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:32:26.334 --> 02:32:28.455]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:28.755 --> 02:32:31.916]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:31.916 --> 02:32:37.036]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:37.036 --> 02:32:45.078]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:45.078 --> 02:32:53.119]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:53.119 --> 02:32:57.780]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[02:33:04.724 --> 02:33:06.264]  Dun-dun-dun-dun!
[02:33:06.264 --> 02:33:10.366]  Boy, Hawaii is so beautiful.
[02:33:10.366 --> 02:33:15.807]  If I was ever gonna punch out of this fight, that's where I'll be headed.
[02:33:15.807 --> 02:33:28.091]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.091 --> 02:33:30.732]  Think how far we've come in the fight against tyranny.
[02:33:32.805 --> 02:33:37.168]  But think of the depths our enemies will stoop to to attack us.
[02:33:37.168 --> 02:33:39.270]  President Trump, a Russian agent.
[02:33:39.270 --> 02:33:41.712]  Senator Rand Paul, a Russian agent.
[02:33:41.712 --> 02:33:48.117]  On the floor of the Senate, accused of it with zero evidence.
[02:33:48.117 --> 02:33:53.421]  Myself accused of being a Russian agent in the House and Senate committee meetings.
[02:33:53.421 --> 02:33:54.542]  I've just shown you one clip.
[02:33:54.542 --> 02:33:55.643]  We're trying to find the others.
[02:33:55.643 --> 02:33:57.084]  We have transcripts of it.
[02:33:57.084 --> 02:33:59.766]  It's happened at least seven times, I know, of the last week.
[02:34:01.664 --> 02:34:02.404]  Does that scare me?
[02:34:02.404 --> 02:34:07.926]  No, that makes me think, wow, I'm really getting to the satisfied point now that I did my job.
[02:34:07.926 --> 02:34:18.651]  Because I'm going to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, we'll defend this Republican humanity.
[02:34:18.651 --> 02:34:23.553]  I just feel sorry for people that aren't part of the big victory.
[02:34:23.553 --> 02:34:23.873]  Because
[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:35.387]  The fact that globalism, unelected world government, so outrageous, is now being exposed and falling as we speak.
[02:34:35.387 --> 02:34:42.792]  And the omen of David Rockefeller dying in the midst of this battle.
[02:34:42.792 --> 02:34:46.514]  These are days that will be long remembered.
[02:34:46.514 --> 02:34:47.215]  Make no mistake.
[02:34:49.335 --> 02:34:52.256]  I used to hear that quote from Kennedy and think it was cheesy.
[02:34:52.256 --> 02:34:54.897]  Ask not what your country can do for you, what you can do for your country.
[02:34:54.897 --> 02:35:00.198]  Oh, my country's about the people and empowering humanity and strength and honor and the Renaissance.
[02:35:00.198 --> 02:35:03.920]  Absolutely, because that's what people gave to put us here.
[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:08.801]  It's the honor, it's the strength, it's the will.
[02:35:08.801 --> 02:35:17.764]  When you're so selfish for your children, and so selfish in your love for the truth, that you're willing to lay everything down.
[02:35:19.892 --> 02:35:21.673]  People would call that being unselfish.
[02:35:21.673 --> 02:35:22.233]  No, it's not.
[02:35:22.233 --> 02:35:27.836]  That's what they don't get.
[02:35:27.836 --> 02:35:37.641]  That's when you join with everything good in the universe forever is when you make the free will choice to be honorable and to have courage and to not be a piece of crap.
[02:35:39.650 --> 02:35:43.952]  And that's why these people that serve evil are given temporal power.
[02:35:43.952 --> 02:35:46.033]  It's like rags, dirty diapers.
[02:35:46.033 --> 02:35:47.414]  It's just crap.
[02:35:47.414 --> 02:35:50.816]  Mansions, money, helicopters, empty people.
[02:35:50.816 --> 02:36:01.181]  You get around the centers of power, they've got all these palaces and all this crap, but there's a spirit of failure and emptiness to it.
[02:36:01.181 --> 02:36:06.144]  But you go out fishing on an old boat with an old man on the ocean who knows
[02:36:07.375 --> 02:36:15.482]  How the world works and where we came from and you hear their little parables and you know this is wisdom and there's deep strength in it.
[02:36:15.482 --> 02:36:20.026]  For an old woman or a young man or a young girl, whatever it is, it's truth.
[02:36:20.026 --> 02:36:25.251]  Like wind through the trees, as the sun rises, the sun sets.
[02:36:25.251 --> 02:36:26.292]  As our lives go on.
[02:36:26.292 --> 02:36:31.036]  It's a spirit.
[02:36:31.036 --> 02:36:32.698]  It's where you decide to be.
[02:36:35.287 --> 02:36:40.670]  In that strong, quiet place of the most high.
[02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:44.732]  And that's where I am when I'm not on air.
[02:36:44.732 --> 02:36:50.954]  Hours and hours a day in just controlled focus.
[02:36:50.954 --> 02:36:56.177]  And then I have to look at all the news and look at the enemy and look at them and I come on air and I blow up.
[02:36:56.177 --> 02:36:57.418]  Because it's just a joke.
[02:36:57.418 --> 02:37:00.699]  Why would anyone follow these clear enemies?
[02:37:00.699 --> 02:37:02.160]  These are known liars.
[02:37:04.107 --> 02:37:15.152]  These enslavers, these persecutors of the children.
[02:37:15.152 --> 02:37:19.234]  There's that saying, it's the journey, not the destination.
[02:37:19.234 --> 02:37:27.497]  The trip is the destination.
[02:37:27.497 --> 02:37:31.619]  And that really is what life is on this planet.
[02:37:31.619 --> 02:37:33.400]  It's not about the things you have or
[02:37:35.319 --> 02:37:38.942]  How other people think you're powerful, that's enslavement.
[02:37:38.942 --> 02:37:47.130]  You only need to be strong to defend and protect what's good.
[02:37:47.130 --> 02:37:52.515]  I mean, we should all thank God every minute that we aren't Nancy Pelosi or Schiff.
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:58.364]  Or Hillary Clinton, or these globalists, or Herman Van Rompuy, or any of these people.
[02:37:58.364 --> 02:37:59.325]  I mean, you look at these people.
[02:37:59.325 --> 02:38:11.775]  These are pathetic, twisted, warped, openly evil, grasping... scum!
[02:38:11.775 --> 02:38:12.676]  Michael, finish your points.
[02:38:12.676 --> 02:38:13.617]  You got caught off by the break.
[02:38:13.617 --> 02:38:14.998]  Go ahead.
[02:38:14.998 --> 02:38:16.399]  Yeah, they're skexes, Alex.
[02:38:16.399 --> 02:38:17.280]  That's all they are.
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:19.061]  They never will be anything else.
[02:38:19.061 --> 02:38:19.982]  Just remember this.
[02:38:20.945 --> 02:38:25.447]  You can't walk into a room full of candles with any amount of darkness and extinguish the light.
[02:38:25.447 --> 02:38:30.208]  But you can walk into any room full of any amount of darkness with one candle and extinguish the darkness.
[02:38:30.208 --> 02:38:30.869]  They're that weak.
[02:38:30.869 --> 02:38:32.849]  That's right.
[02:38:32.849 --> 02:38:33.690]  They're not strong.
[02:38:33.690 --> 02:38:34.970]  That's why they seek power.
[02:38:34.970 --> 02:38:35.910]  That's why they seek power.
[02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:37.751]  It's because they are weak.
[02:38:37.751 --> 02:38:39.011]  Well, they're only deception.
[02:38:39.011 --> 02:38:40.912]  All the power they have is deception.
[02:38:40.912 --> 02:38:45.674]  And once you put the light on their deception and tell the truth, they fail.
[02:38:45.674 --> 02:38:46.214]  Every time.
[02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:57.762]  It's holding the light onto the evil one that makes him run and scurry like a cockroach.
[02:38:57.762 --> 02:39:01.043]  I gotta say, Alex, I gotta give you so much credit.
[02:39:01.043 --> 02:39:03.184]  I've been watching you for five years.
[02:39:03.184 --> 02:39:09.105]  I have friends and family that tell me, you're a liar, you're insane, you do all this crazy stuff.
[02:39:09.105 --> 02:39:16.987]  And all I constantly do is look and do the research of everything you say and everything that I've seen in five years.
[02:39:18.738 --> 02:39:25.983]  Well, that's why they attack my credibility all day, is... All I try to do is tell the truth.
[02:39:25.983 --> 02:39:29.946]  I make mistakes sometimes, but I... I'm a God-fearing person.
[02:39:29.946 --> 02:39:33.689]  So, all of us, if we have the Holy Spirit, the presence of God, I would be...
[02:39:35.046 --> 02:39:39.849]  To even think like the enemy and to think of doing bad things creates incredible anxiety and fear.
[02:39:39.849 --> 02:39:43.891]  I never have fear unless I think about crossing God, and I don't even want to cross God.
[02:39:43.891 --> 02:39:49.274]  But when I study the enemy and what they're doing, I feel fear of God, just what they're doing, watching them.
[02:39:49.274 --> 02:39:51.716]  And I don't mean I'm some perfect person, but I mean...
[02:39:52.316 --> 02:40:02.866]  I think about how they want to hurt children, how they want to hurt God's greatest creation, how they wanted to attack women, and the womb, and the relationship of our families, and our whole human past, and everything we've been together.
[02:40:02.866 --> 02:40:05.989]  And it's just outrageous how bad they are.
[02:40:05.989 --> 02:40:08.731]  But people are asleep, and so the veil's being lifted.
[02:40:08.731 --> 02:40:10.052]  But don't thank me, brother.
[02:40:10.052 --> 02:40:11.594]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[02:40:12.234 --> 02:40:18.642]  I want to ignite men like you, who are as smart as I am, or smarter, to be your own leaders and take action.
[02:40:18.642 --> 02:40:22.046]  And when you do that, which is starting to happen, the enemy will fall.
[02:40:22.046 --> 02:40:23.587]  Go ahead.
[02:40:23.587 --> 02:40:24.969]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:40:24.969 --> 02:40:27.992]  We're allowed to rebroadcast your information, is that correct?
[02:40:27.992 --> 02:40:28.173]  Yes.
[02:40:29.946 --> 02:40:35.472]  I have no problem doing so, and I'm ready to start my own channel as well.
[02:40:35.472 --> 02:40:37.614]  I want to get any information out there.
[02:40:37.614 --> 02:40:39.136]  There's some great people out on the web.
[02:40:39.136 --> 02:40:42.439]  They're all working together, and they're all on our side.
[02:40:42.439 --> 02:40:45.262]  They're actually working together as a community, and it's nice to see.
[02:40:47.961 --> 02:40:48.902]  Well, thank you.
[02:40:48.902 --> 02:40:49.362]  The products...
[02:41:05.247 --> 02:41:06.388]  Thank you.
[02:41:06.388 --> 02:41:07.509]  God bless you.
[02:41:07.509 --> 02:41:08.790]  Yeah, I barely plug an hour.
[02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:11.452]  Uh, the enemy all has big globalist funding.
[02:41:11.452 --> 02:41:16.516]  We fund ourselves 70% or so with, I guess it will be more now we got manned off Google ads.
[02:41:16.516 --> 02:41:19.918]  So I go outside the show to go try to make the money to fund the operation.
[02:41:19.918 --> 02:41:22.240]  But if I won the lottery, I don't play the lottery, but I won the lottery.
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:24.522]  You know, I would put it all into the operation.
[02:41:24.522 --> 02:41:26.163]  We were driving back from hunting the other day with some friends.
[02:41:26.163 --> 02:41:27.124]  They said, what would you do with the lottery?
[02:41:27.124 --> 02:41:27.524]  What would you do?
[02:41:27.524 --> 02:41:31.327]  And I said, I'll put it all back in the operation.
[02:41:31.327 --> 02:41:31.447]  And
[02:41:33.749 --> 02:41:35.330]  I mean, I can't even stand it.
[02:41:35.330 --> 02:41:37.312]  It's not that it's bad.
[02:41:37.312 --> 02:41:39.474]  Possessions are crap.
[02:41:39.474 --> 02:41:39.894]  It's old.
[02:41:39.894 --> 02:41:42.357]  It just means nothing.
[02:41:42.357 --> 02:41:43.057]  You need medicine.
[02:41:43.057 --> 02:41:44.739]  You need transportation.
[02:41:44.739 --> 02:41:46.680]  But the enemy is people who sell out for nothing.
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:52.786]  They want to keep us poor, keep us under their control, keep things artificially scarce so they can buy us up for nothing.
[02:41:52.786 --> 02:42:00.052]  And Trump's trying to break that, and that's his greatest sin, is he wants a big, prosperous country.
[02:42:01.215 --> 02:42:05.236]  He wants to be the guy that turned America around, the guy that launched a huge dynasty.
[02:42:05.236 --> 02:42:08.297]  He's totally in.
[02:42:08.297 --> 02:42:10.558]  He understands how much trouble the economy's in.
[02:42:10.558 --> 02:42:13.299]  He's making hundreds of phone calls a day trying to get jobs back to prop it up.
[02:42:13.299 --> 02:42:15.880]  He understands Obamacare is designed to destroy it.
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:21.222]  So even though this other bill isn't perfect, he can get it done, and it's better in ways, it'll stabilize things.
[02:42:21.222 --> 02:42:23.763]  I understand.
[02:42:23.763 --> 02:42:25.463]  But you did too good, Trump.
[02:42:25.463 --> 02:42:26.624]  We did too good.
[02:42:26.624 --> 02:42:28.865]  People aren't putting up with that, bro.
[02:42:28.865 --> 02:42:29.985]  We're going to have total repeal.
[02:42:31.223 --> 02:42:33.884]  We're going to defund all the agencies just like you're doing.
[02:42:33.884 --> 02:42:35.504]  I'm ready to go on to the end no matter what happens.
[02:42:35.504 --> 02:42:38.145]  I got Roger Stone to pop on because so many developments have happened.
[02:42:38.145 --> 02:42:41.466]  We're going to go to Chris, Beth, Wild, Lex and others after Roger leaves us.
[02:42:41.466 --> 02:42:42.386]  He's just here a few minutes.
[02:42:42.386 --> 02:42:47.108]  But first, here's Senator Rand Paul again last week.
[02:42:47.108 --> 02:42:47.988]  This clicked this morning.
[02:42:47.988 --> 02:42:52.209]  Like, I've been attacked as a Russian agent in McClatchy, AP, Reuters, you name it.
[02:42:52.209 --> 02:42:54.490]  I mean, the leftist groups are saying, good, arrest Alex Jones.
[02:42:56.718 --> 02:42:58.999]  And they like hop up and down like I'm scared.
[02:42:58.999 --> 02:42:59.899]  Arrest me!
[02:42:59.899 --> 02:43:00.860]  Shoot me in the back of the head!
[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:03.801]  I'm not a Russian agent.
[02:43:03.801 --> 02:43:09.003]  I'm an agent of the Republic and prosperity and Americana.
[02:43:09.003 --> 02:43:12.764]  But those of you that don't have that background, I understand.
[02:43:12.764 --> 02:43:13.804]  I get it.
[02:43:13.804 --> 02:43:15.265]  You come from parasites and trash.
[02:43:15.265 --> 02:43:16.745]  I'm sorry for you.
[02:43:16.745 --> 02:43:20.507]  You just see somebody up there like a champion battling for you like Trump or myself.
[02:43:22.350 --> 02:43:25.652]  And whether we're perfect, we're not.
[02:43:25.652 --> 02:43:26.593]  We are your champions.
[02:43:26.593 --> 02:43:27.973]  We're in the arena.
[02:43:27.973 --> 02:43:28.914]  We're here.
[02:43:28.914 --> 02:43:30.795]  We're under the attack.
[02:43:30.795 --> 02:43:32.576]  We want to be here!
[02:43:32.576 --> 02:43:34.717]  We're just saying, we need your prayers.
[02:43:34.717 --> 02:43:37.099]  Because this isn't a game.
[02:43:37.099 --> 02:43:38.459]  This isn't a joke.
[02:43:38.459 --> 02:43:41.481]  It's not a simulation.
[02:43:41.481 --> 02:43:45.423]  I can tell you the stuff behind the scenes and I won't tell you because I can't.
[02:43:45.423 --> 02:43:48.065]  It's been hard.
[02:43:48.065 --> 02:43:49.606]  But I realize the more good I do,
[02:43:52.307 --> 02:44:03.373]  My personal persecution out of my family is to teach me lessons so that I can empathize with other people.
[02:44:03.373 --> 02:44:09.676]  Because to really empathize, you have to go through the things other people are going through.
[02:44:09.676 --> 02:44:11.617]  Because that's where the strength is.
[02:44:11.617 --> 02:44:16.499]  Not ignoring your feelings, not ignoring humanity, but really going into it.
[02:44:16.499 --> 02:44:17.240]  Taking it all on.
[02:44:21.954 --> 02:44:23.635]  That's where the strength is.
[02:44:23.635 --> 02:44:27.238]  And just let these people know, no matter what they do, we're not going to stop.
[02:44:27.238 --> 02:44:31.662]  Here's the clip of Senator Rand Paul being attacked, and then the latest with myself, and then Roger Stone.
[02:44:31.662 --> 02:44:38.448]  And in the NDAA, in the New Defense Authorization Act, they talk about even militarily going after us, not just taking over the media.
[02:44:38.448 --> 02:44:48.096]  And they have the Board of Governors, the very ones the CIA has taken over, testifying that I'm a Russian agent, with no proof, in front of the House Armed Services Committee.
[02:44:48.096 --> 02:44:50.258]  Ladies and gentlemen, this means they're planning to kill Trump.
[02:44:51.343 --> 02:44:55.126]  They've decided in their government operations that this is the truth.
[02:44:55.126 --> 02:45:03.571]  They're trying to sell weak-minded people on this being the idea, and we are on the verge of total war.
[02:45:03.571 --> 02:45:06.093]  Trump needs to take action.
[02:45:06.093 --> 02:45:07.714]  The threats are credible.
[02:45:07.714 --> 02:45:10.056]  The Secret Service has done nothing.
[02:45:10.056 --> 02:45:15.940]  He needs to understand that the Secret Service can't protect him.
[02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:17.401]  We're already in a civil emergency.
[02:45:17.401 --> 02:45:18.402]  They're pushing a civil war.
[02:45:19.366 --> 02:45:22.387]  The Republic is in a death battle.
[02:45:22.387 --> 02:45:24.447]  We can't paper over it.
[02:45:24.447 --> 02:45:26.508]  Trump has to move against the enemy within.
[02:45:26.508 --> 02:45:29.328]  They're claiming we're the enemy within because they're the enemy.
[02:45:29.328 --> 02:45:30.889]  But let's play this clip and then we'll skip this break.
[02:45:30.889 --> 02:45:31.909]  Go to Roger Stone.
[02:45:31.909 --> 02:45:36.050]  Here is the clip of them going after Senator Poll.
[02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:41.831]  The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made.
[02:45:41.831 --> 02:45:45.972]  He has no justification for his objection to
[02:45:47.082 --> 02:45:53.447]  Having a small nation be part of NATO that is under assault from the Russians.
[02:45:53.447 --> 02:46:00.693]  So I repeat again, the Senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[02:46:00.693 --> 02:46:06.018]  Because he tries to pass a bill out of committee without a hearing on the floor to start a war and put U.S.
[02:46:06.018 --> 02:46:10.161]  troops into Montenegro in the Balkans.
[02:46:10.161 --> 02:46:12.022]  He's already got bills to send in Ukraine.
[02:46:12.022 --> 02:46:14.084]  He's like, no, we're going to have debates about this.
[02:46:14.084 --> 02:46:14.945]  Oh, you're a Russian agent.
[02:46:16.837 --> 02:46:22.602]  In the day of Andrew Jackson, he'd have dragged him out in the street and had a duel.
[02:46:22.602 --> 02:46:24.603]  Here's one more clip, then we're going to Roger Stone.
[02:46:24.603 --> 02:46:25.624]  Again, I got a bunch of these clips.
[02:46:25.624 --> 02:46:32.169]  They're saying Tucker Carlson's a Russian agent, you know, Schiff, the minion of Pelosi, little pillow-biter man.
[02:46:32.169 --> 02:46:35.292]  I'm not against people that are like that, but it's just ridiculous.
[02:46:35.292 --> 02:46:37.694]  Whatever the hell's going on with the guy, it's completely out of his mind.
[02:46:37.694 --> 02:46:45.480]  Just the stuff he does is, and then of course you've got them, the Board of Governors, the FCC, in front of Congress, saying, I'm a Russian operative, here it is.
[02:46:47.523 --> 02:46:51.105]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to, I think, Ms.
[02:46:51.105 --> 02:46:55.687]  Spears' question that there are other RTs operating in the U.S.
[02:46:55.687 --> 02:46:59.189]  Can you describe them, list them?
[02:46:59.189 --> 02:47:02.350]  Sure, thank you.
[02:47:02.350 --> 02:47:08.674]  Other RTs, and then he lists some clip thing like Getty Images and then Sputnik and Russia, and then me!
[02:47:08.674 --> 02:47:09.274]  Here it is, sorry.
[02:47:10.540 --> 02:47:20.572]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Ruppli, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[02:47:20.572 --> 02:47:25.078]  InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers for those modalities.
[02:47:27.588 --> 02:47:31.289]  You know, Armstrong, I deserve to be able to answer you with your immunity.
[02:47:31.289 --> 02:47:32.650]  I deserve to stand against you.
[02:47:32.650 --> 02:47:34.370]  But I'll just say this in front of God and everybody else.
[02:47:34.370 --> 02:47:38.152]  You're an enemy of this country and a sack of crap and a globalist operative.
[02:47:38.152 --> 02:47:41.033]  And the Communist Chinese have infiltrated us so bad, I don't even know if we can fix it.
[02:47:42.199 --> 02:47:45.221]  Piece of trash.
[02:47:45.221 --> 02:47:46.503]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:46.503 --> 02:47:48.044]  Let's go to Roger Stone right now.
[02:47:48.044 --> 02:47:52.047]  Roger, you've been dealing with this for months, but it's entered a new phase.
[02:47:52.047 --> 02:47:57.592]  I've said they're going to incrementally escalate it until they make their move on Trump.
[02:47:57.592 --> 02:47:58.853]  They are the inside enemy.
[02:47:58.853 --> 02:48:00.114]  They're what they say we are.
[02:48:00.114 --> 02:48:06.539]  They're the ones that are trying to stop the recovery, destroy our borders, blocking the sanctuary cities.
[02:48:06.539 --> 02:48:07.880]  I'm sorry, Trump has to move against them.
[02:48:09.924 --> 02:48:29.393]  Yeah, Alex, that performance yesterday by the House Intelligence Committee was a first-class example of demagoguery, red-baiting, fear-mongering, half-truths, no-truths, every word pejoratively worded to distort it.
[02:48:29.393 --> 02:48:35.016]  The Democrats just don't seem to be able to face up to the fact that they ran a lousy, corrupt candidate.
[02:48:35.902 --> 02:48:40.144]  She had no program and that Donald Trump was the real thing.
[02:48:40.144 --> 02:48:44.646]  And they had the whole media and the bots and the whole system is admitted to be fake.
[02:48:44.646 --> 02:48:45.607]  So what do we do?
[02:48:45.607 --> 02:48:51.390]  Because clearly they're not getting the Pentagon involved, the CIA and the media and saying we're Russian agents for nothing.
[02:48:51.390 --> 02:48:52.871]  They've already tried to kill you twice.
[02:48:52.871 --> 02:48:54.011]  They're moving against us.
[02:48:54.011 --> 02:48:55.292]  So what does Trump do?
[02:48:56.161 --> 02:49:12.202]  Well, and in my case, I have this particularly nice setup where they ask James Comey repeatedly about me, and he says, oh, I can't comment on that, leaving the pregnant implication hanging in the air that I am being investigated, therefore I've done something wrong.
[02:49:13.704 --> 02:49:16.545]  These things have to be refuted one by one.
[02:49:16.545 --> 02:49:23.567]  There is no evidence whatsoever of any Russian collusion to elect Donald Trump.
[02:49:23.567 --> 02:49:25.107]  It's a fraud.
[02:49:25.107 --> 02:49:27.008]  The American people did it!
[02:49:27.008 --> 02:49:33.369]  The whole media and the bots and foreign governments were piled on against Trump, not the other way around.
[02:49:33.369 --> 02:49:40.951]  And in the case of John McCain, whose clip you just played, I mean, with all due respect, the Senator's mentally unbalanced.
[02:49:40.951 --> 02:49:42.632]  He needs a psychological test.
[02:49:43.314 --> 02:49:46.276]  He is so driven by bitterness and anger.
[02:49:46.276 --> 02:49:46.917]  No, I agree.
[02:49:46.917 --> 02:49:52.561]  So what I'm asking you is, obviously, I'm now accused, which we just, is even, I mean, this is so ridiculous.
[02:49:52.561 --> 02:49:53.622]  I've known it's ridiculous with you.
[02:49:53.622 --> 02:49:55.023]  Our phones have been tapped.
[02:49:55.023 --> 02:49:56.264]  It's all come out in the news.
[02:49:56.264 --> 02:49:58.626]  Total blackout on that other than Drudge.
[02:49:58.626 --> 02:49:59.527]  What does Trump do?
[02:49:59.527 --> 02:50:03.550]  Because he's got a bunch of wimps in his administration who make all the mistakes.
[02:50:03.550 --> 02:50:05.551]  He doesn't make mistakes, so far.
[02:50:05.551 --> 02:50:09.634]  He needs to, like, have, I mean, she got money from the Chinese, money from the Russians.
[02:50:11.175 --> 02:50:12.355]  10,000 times what Trump ever did.
[02:50:12.355 --> 02:50:14.996]  I mean, we need to go after these damn people.
[02:50:14.996 --> 02:50:19.297]  They're trying to destroy us when they're the ones on the Russian payroll!
[02:50:19.297 --> 02:50:21.437]  I want them indicted now!
[02:50:21.437 --> 02:50:23.618]  I want in front of the Senate now!
[02:50:23.618 --> 02:50:26.119]  I want Armstrong here with boxing gloves on!
[02:50:26.119 --> 02:50:28.199]  That son of a bitch!
[02:50:28.199 --> 02:50:30.259]  Saying I'm a Russian agent!
[02:50:30.259 --> 02:50:30.860]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:33.220]  I'm skipping the break.
[02:50:33.220 --> 02:50:37.121]  Unfortunately, Reince Priebus is not exactly a wartime conciliary.
[02:50:38.024 --> 02:50:41.805]  These are lily-livered, country-club, established Republicans.
[02:50:41.805 --> 02:50:50.887]  Yeah, they're a bunch of cowardly, boot-licking cucks that have been sticking their noses up people's you-know-what's forever, and Trump needs to get the hell away from them.
[02:50:50.887 --> 02:51:05.471]  But specifically, let's take for example the fact that you and I both know that the President was under surveillance at Trump Tower, that surveillance of him starts much, much earlier, actually under the Bush administration, as
[02:51:06.031 --> 02:51:08.092]  InfoWars revealed only yesterday.
[02:51:08.092 --> 02:51:10.634]  And notice, total static on that two days ago.
[02:51:10.634 --> 02:51:12.615]  No response, no nothing.
[02:51:12.615 --> 02:51:14.576]  Media Matters didn't even deny it was real.
[02:51:14.576 --> 02:51:17.018]  Instead they said, have they released classified info?
[02:51:17.018 --> 02:51:19.699]  And now I'm getting phone calls, oh, you released classified info.
[02:51:19.699 --> 02:51:21.901]  Yeah, little Obama was spying on Trump.
[02:51:21.901 --> 02:51:24.442]  Stick that up your snout.
[02:51:24.442 --> 02:51:30.066]  Well, and in the meantime, what you have is the President's chief advisors like Sean Spicer and
[02:51:31.481 --> 02:51:35.622]  Reince Priebus wringing their hands and saying, oh, can't we walk this back?
[02:51:35.622 --> 02:51:37.323]  We really ought to put out an apology.
[02:51:37.323 --> 02:51:40.984]  And the Trump countermands and says, I never apologized.
[02:51:40.984 --> 02:51:41.564]  Exactly.
[02:51:41.564 --> 02:51:42.404]  Because he's right.
[02:51:42.404 --> 02:51:43.724]  He shouldn't apologize.
[02:51:43.724 --> 02:51:46.085]  It took over a year for the Watergate cover-up to crumble.
[02:51:46.085 --> 02:51:49.826]  Do you know what he did saying our coal is back up for use?
[02:51:49.826 --> 02:51:52.227]  That is trillions just in the next decade of use.
[02:51:52.227 --> 02:52:00.149]  That's trillions taken from Russia in energy sales, driving down the price of natural gas that we're now shipping in massive ships.
[02:52:00.589 --> 02:52:02.212]  Out of the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:52:02.212 --> 02:52:04.015]  He just devastated Russia.
[02:52:04.015 --> 02:52:04.737]  He's dumb.
[02:52:04.737 --> 02:52:06.500]  And we're not even trying to devastate Russia.
[02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:11.649]  The point is, our stock market was up because Trump is back in business for America.
[02:52:11.649 --> 02:52:13.713]  He is devastating everybody!
[02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:17.573]  To answer your question as to what the President must do, it's obvious.
[02:52:17.573 --> 02:52:19.535]  He needs to go on offense.
[02:52:19.535 --> 02:52:22.419]  Lay out the crimes of Bill and Hillary.
[02:52:22.419 --> 02:52:35.934]  Start by telling Jeff Sessions to appoint a special prosecutor and let's go over those 650,000 emails that were found at the last minute that came from Kuma Abedin to her secret private server.
[02:52:36.915 --> 02:52:42.461]  Let's lay out the Chinese assistance to the Clinton campaign.
[02:52:42.461 --> 02:52:46.265]  The president has the bully pulpit and he has the power.
[02:52:46.265 --> 02:52:47.106]  He's got to attack.
[02:52:47.106 --> 02:52:49.849]  Just like he lost the first debate, we said you've got to attack, he did.
[02:52:49.849 --> 02:52:51.591]  He's got to attack and attack now.
[02:52:52.606 --> 02:52:53.206]  Exactly.
[02:52:53.206 --> 02:52:59.630]  Because you see, the establishment Republicans around him don't have the belly.
[02:52:59.630 --> 02:53:06.475]  And notice they're attacking Roger Stone and Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and others because we will attack.
[02:53:06.475 --> 02:53:08.096]  Because they fear the attack.
[02:53:10.259 --> 02:53:16.265]  Well, Sean Spicer says he has no idea what role I played in the 2016 election.
[02:53:16.265 --> 02:53:26.415]  I would strongly urge that he get a copy of The Making of the President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated the... Oh, Spicer, they're all a bunch of sycophants.
[02:53:26.415 --> 02:53:31.200]  The point is, is that Trump miscalculated his first time going along with this...
[02:53:32.438 --> 02:53:36.980]  This Paul Ryan bill, I understand why he did it, because it's going to wreck the economy if he doesn't.
[02:53:36.980 --> 02:53:40.401]  It's better than the Obama bill, I get it, but only by maybe 30%.
[02:53:40.401 --> 02:53:43.262]  And so that's where he got his first dent in his approval ratings.
[02:53:43.262 --> 02:53:45.903]  Trump really has to get back on the attack.
[02:53:47.555 --> 02:53:49.276]  I could not agree more.
[02:54:04.864 --> 02:54:11.467]  Well look, in closing, I know you're at the airport, you gotta go, thanks for popping in, but I've now joined the club with you, and I get why you were so mad.
[02:54:11.467 --> 02:54:19.470]  When you're actually accused on TV of being a Russian agent and you're under investigation, it pisses you off, you know, it's crazy.
[02:54:19.470 --> 02:54:25.492]  So what does it mean now that I'm officially being investigated, being directed by Russian agents?
[02:54:26.572 --> 02:54:37.461]  Yesterday I had three different press calls all asking me whether I know whether or not Alex Jones's broadcasts are being supported by Russian funded bots.
[02:54:37.461 --> 02:54:39.943]  And the answer is, of course, no.
[02:54:39.943 --> 02:54:51.153]  But is it coincidental that three different mainstream media reporters call all in the same day with the same load of, you know, that same steaming pile of dung?
[02:54:53.442 --> 02:54:55.923]  We're supported by our listeners, and they're calling them bots.
[02:54:55.923 --> 02:54:56.723]  They didn't vote.
[02:54:56.723 --> 02:54:57.903]  They didn't take action.
[02:54:57.903 --> 02:54:59.584]  I've gotten zero money from the Russians.
[02:54:59.584 --> 02:55:00.344]  What the?
[02:55:00.344 --> 02:55:02.465]  God, they're like the Russians have the GDP of Italy.
[02:55:02.465 --> 02:55:04.365]  They can't even run their own giant country.
[02:55:04.365 --> 02:55:21.350]  This claim that you and I, you for 40 plus years a patriot, right-wing nationalist, anti-Soviet, rolling up Russian operations in DC, that I'm the super patriot, that we're Russian agents, is laughable, but it gives them the cover in the deep state to make political runs at us.
[02:55:21.770 --> 02:55:23.012]  There's no question about it.
[02:55:23.012 --> 02:55:25.035]  There is a slow motion coup to take out Donald Trump.
[02:55:25.035 --> 02:55:27.679]  And I, for one, have no intention of letting
[02:55:35.407 --> 02:55:36.968]  Well, let me say this in closing.
[02:55:36.968 --> 02:55:38.128]  They tried to kill you with polonium.
[02:55:38.128 --> 02:55:39.249]  They T-boned you last week.
[02:55:39.249 --> 02:55:41.290]  They want to kill you before those hearings.
[02:55:41.290 --> 02:55:42.591]  You need to go to the press club.
[02:55:42.591 --> 02:55:43.311]  I'll send a crew.
[02:55:43.311 --> 02:55:46.493]  You need to have a press conference demanding it happen.
[02:55:46.493 --> 02:55:54.577]  We'll build it up for next week or whenever you want and just say, my God, you know, America, wake up to this and say before they kill me.
[02:55:54.577 --> 02:55:57.899]  Because they're trying to kill you, no doubt, before you get up there.
[02:55:57.899 --> 02:55:59.040]  And now that I've been put in the bag,
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:00.260]  I'm not stupid.
[02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:02.521]  They know I'll destroy them in a real debate.
[02:56:02.521 --> 02:56:06.382]  They want to be able to crucify dead men as strong men.
[02:56:06.382 --> 02:56:11.264]  Roger, we're truly together in this in history, and you know, I'm honored.
[02:56:11.264 --> 02:56:12.665]  We're defending America.
[02:56:12.665 --> 02:56:16.046]  We've put a president in there with the American people that is trying to turn the country back on.
[02:56:16.046 --> 02:56:19.287]  We've done a man's job already, brother, but we've got a lot further to go.
[02:56:20.356 --> 02:56:26.483]  I can't think of anybody I'd rather be in the foxhole more with, because I will fight to the very end.
[02:56:26.483 --> 02:56:30.927]  We've got the globalists on the run, and I'm not going down without a fight.
[02:56:30.927 --> 02:56:32.929]  It's good to be here, buddy, with that machine gun with you.
[02:56:32.929 --> 02:56:33.930]  We'll keep feeding those bells.
[02:56:33.930 --> 02:56:35.672]  We're going to win.
[02:56:35.672 --> 02:56:36.233]  Take care, Alex.
[02:56:36.233 --> 02:56:37.774]  I'm going to jump on this plane here.
[02:56:37.774 --> 02:56:38.275]  Absolutely.
[02:56:38.275 --> 02:56:38.996]  All right.
[02:56:38.996 --> 02:56:40.357]  I'm going to go to break, take a few more calls.
[02:56:40.357 --> 02:56:42.039]  Then Paul Watts is coming in from London, England.
[02:56:47.554 --> 02:56:53.117]  We've got the new fluoride-free, high-quality toothpaste with the iodine and the cloyal silver in it.
[02:56:53.117 --> 02:56:58.939]  Super Blue is back in for a limited time to get the ingredients, to get the mass amounts made.
[02:56:58.939 --> 02:57:04.142]  Next time we're going to escalate, you know, do like five times more so that we don't always have problems with manufacturing.
[02:57:05.336 --> 02:57:08.579]  Production, but it is available now, and you get two tubes of it.
[02:57:08.579 --> 02:57:10.261]  It's discounted down to $8 a tube.
[02:57:10.261 --> 02:57:11.642]  It's super high quality.
[02:57:11.642 --> 02:57:13.744]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:13.744 --> 02:57:15.866]  30-40% off the high-quality, sortable food.
[02:57:15.866 --> 02:57:16.687]  We do that rarely.
[02:57:16.687 --> 02:57:17.668]  It's high quality.
[02:57:17.668 --> 02:57:22.773]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:22.773 --> 02:57:25.015]  But I can tell you, I've not compromised.
[02:57:25.015 --> 02:57:27.217]  I've not faltered or given in or backed down.
[02:57:28.098 --> 02:57:31.999]  And, uh, I just want to defeat a bunch of anti-human scum and a bunch of psychopaths.
[02:57:31.999 --> 02:57:34.580]  I don't... I don't want power, money, any of it.
[02:57:34.580 --> 02:57:36.001]  I don't say that as like a platitude.
[02:57:36.001 --> 02:57:38.201]  I mean, I... People need to understand why I'm doing this.
[02:57:38.201 --> 02:57:39.202]  These are bad people.
[02:57:39.202 --> 02:57:45.944]  They must be... My soul, my gut, my spirit wants to defeat them.
[02:57:45.944 --> 02:57:48.024]  And they serve their wicked energy.
[02:57:48.024 --> 02:57:49.225]  They want to crush us.
[02:57:49.225 --> 02:57:51.305]  So I know I'm in a fight.
[02:57:51.305 --> 02:57:53.326]  And I'm here to tell you, we're all in a fight.
[02:57:53.326 --> 02:57:53.406]  And...
[02:57:54.943 --> 02:57:56.024]  You need to get the products.
[02:57:56.024 --> 02:57:57.485]  You need to filter your water.
[02:57:57.485 --> 02:57:58.245]  We got the best systems.
[02:57:58.245 --> 02:58:00.367]  You need to grow a garden and be pro-human.
[02:58:00.367 --> 02:58:01.368]  It's fun to do.
[02:58:01.368 --> 02:58:02.508]  Even in the city, you can do it.
[02:58:02.508 --> 02:58:03.489]  Huge selection.
[02:58:03.489 --> 02:58:04.490]  Non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:58:04.490 --> 02:58:09.533]  You need to get a Trump 2020 shirt at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:09.533 --> 02:58:14.016]  You need to spread the links, the articles, the InfoWars.com forward slash show link.
[02:58:14.016 --> 02:58:15.978]  InfoWars.com forward slash show link.
[02:58:15.978 --> 02:58:16.939]  They're trying to censor it everywhere.
[02:58:16.939 --> 02:58:18.540]  They can't stop you in your own email.
[02:58:18.540 --> 02:58:20.381]  They can't stop you sending it to friends and family.
[02:58:20.381 --> 02:58:21.802]  They can't stop you putting a billboard up.
[02:58:21.802 --> 02:58:24.244]  Whatever you do, I'm all in.
[02:58:26.505 --> 02:58:32.807]  1776 Kamikaze in the Info War, hair on fire, ramming it full speed into the enemy deck.
[02:58:32.807 --> 02:58:35.988]  And I'm just telling you right now, you're in the fight whether you know it or not.
[02:58:35.988 --> 02:58:38.168]  All of you that supported us, I salute you, thank you.
[02:58:38.168 --> 02:58:40.069]  Fourth hour straight ahead, I'll do five more minutes.
[02:58:40.069 --> 02:58:42.990]  And then Paul Watson from Albion joins us.
[02:58:49.113 --> 02:58:53.598]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:58:53.598 --> 02:59:04.530]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:59:04.690 --> 02:59:09.733]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:59:09.733 --> 02:59:12.315]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:59:12.315 --> 02:59:14.016]  It helps detoxify.
[02:59:14.016 --> 02:59:16.897]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:59:16.897 --> 02:59:21.680]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:59:21.680 --> 02:59:27.944]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:59:27.944 --> 02:59:33.267]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:59:33.267 --> 02:59:34.028]  I'm taking it now.
[02:59:34.588 --> 02:59:36.468]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:21.053 --> 03:00:23.654]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:23.654 --> 03:00:30.317]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:30.317 --> 03:00:36.819]  In our attempt to restore the Republic, an American reboot, liberals have captured the country, running around like psychopathic demons, ripping everybody off.
[03:00:36.819 --> 03:00:44.843]  Paul Watts, I'm going to take a few phone calls here in this short segment from Chris, and Beth at least, and a few others if you want to, but tell us what's coming up today.
[03:00:44.843 --> 03:00:48.524]  Paul, did you know it's all over the Senate Committee and House Committee?
[03:00:48.524 --> 03:00:49.925]  We work for the Russians.
[03:00:49.925 --> 03:00:50.505]  I didn't know that.
[03:00:51.792 --> 03:01:06.953]  Well, I'm yet to receive my cheque from the Kremlin, Alex, but what we've not discussed, and I'm going to play the clip later, is the source of this whole, you know, Russian troll bots control info wars, and we're working with them, is somebody called Louise Mensch, who has come out with the most...
[03:01:07.714 --> 03:01:10.757]  Crazy conspiracy theories imaginable.
[03:01:10.757 --> 03:01:18.745]  She claims that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the assassination of Andrew Breitbart so then Steve Bannon would be able to take over it.
[03:01:18.745 --> 03:01:22.468]  She was completely decimated during a recent interview on BBC.
[03:01:22.468 --> 03:01:27.473]  She's absolutely crazy and she's the source of this story and now the FBI's picked up on it.
[03:01:29.178 --> 03:01:32.121]  So they've got a true kook.
[03:01:32.121 --> 03:01:39.126]  Well, just like the Washington Post had to retract a few months ago, their fake list saying we were Russian funded, they withdrew it because they admitted it was fake.
[03:01:39.126 --> 03:01:42.469]  So they just found a new kook to put it out.
[03:01:42.469 --> 03:01:43.150]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:01:43.150 --> 03:01:51.537]  I mean, you can say what you want, but the fact is, you know, Democrats have lost 63 House seats, 10 Senate seats, 12 governorships.
[03:01:51.537 --> 03:01:52.498]  900 legislative seats.
[03:01:53.001 --> 03:01:54.883]  Yeah, since 2009.
[03:01:54.883 --> 03:01:57.085]  Was Russia to blame for all that?
[03:01:57.085 --> 03:01:58.547]  You can look at Frenzy.
[03:01:58.547 --> 03:02:00.569]  Europe's pissed about all the Muslims being brought in.
[03:02:00.569 --> 03:02:03.032]  That's in this report against me today.
[03:02:03.032 --> 03:02:04.594]  They claim that that's Russia too!
[03:02:05.484 --> 03:02:06.785]  Everything's Russia.
[03:02:06.785 --> 03:02:10.388]  You know, over in France, they claim Russia is helping Le Pen.
[03:02:10.388 --> 03:02:15.852]  She's got 39% support amongst 18 to 24 year olds, according to polls.
[03:02:15.852 --> 03:02:17.873]  More than double her nearest rival.
[03:02:17.873 --> 03:02:19.254]  Is that Russia?
[03:02:19.254 --> 03:02:25.639]  You know, you've got 41% in the UK now voting Conservative over Liberal and Labour.
[03:02:25.639 --> 03:02:26.680]  Is that Russia?
[03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:27.741]  Is everything Russia?
[03:02:27.741 --> 03:02:33.585]  No, we're rejecting a bunch of megabanks run by jerks like Zuckerberg saying they rule us.
[03:02:33.585 --> 03:02:34.746]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[03:02:36.348 --> 03:02:45.333]  No, and I mean that big article's gone up with all the examples of Google, Facebook, Twitter manipulating their algorithms.
[03:02:45.333 --> 03:02:51.697]  If the FBI wants to investigate someone for manipulating voters during the election, go and investigate Facebook.
[03:02:51.697 --> 03:02:58.742]  Oh, that's the stack I never got to when they admittedly ran Google, Facebook for Hillary, foreign governments involved, no discussion.
[03:02:58.742 --> 03:03:05.766]  I love Donna Brazile bitching about how Russian bots rig stuff when she was on record rigging the debates.
[03:03:07.802 --> 03:03:08.442]  It's amazing.
[03:03:08.442 --> 03:03:19.426]  It's like, you know, we have problems communicating with each other sometimes, and yet we're supposedly in constant communication with evil Russian controllers in the Kremlin, telling us what to do.
[03:03:19.426 --> 03:03:20.846]  Just the very idea of it.
[03:03:20.846 --> 03:03:22.167]  Well, that's because they're a bunch of followers.
[03:03:22.167 --> 03:03:27.189]  Paul, you're one of the senior folks around here, but there's very little communication about what to do.
[03:03:27.189 --> 03:03:30.810]  We're all too busy manning the guns here, but let's put your headline back up on screen.
[03:03:30.810 --> 03:03:33.731]  There it is, dealing with this.
[03:03:33.731 --> 03:03:36.972]  Why the FBI's InfoWars Russia investigation is completely ludicrous.
[03:03:38.015 --> 03:03:39.676]  You're going to go over this after the break.
[03:03:39.676 --> 03:03:42.016]  Take over, Paul Watson.
[03:03:42.016 --> 03:03:42.396]  All right.
[03:03:42.396 --> 03:03:42.997]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:03:42.997 --> 03:03:53.860]  Yeah, we're going to go over that and we're going to flash back to a headline we had up on Friday, which was Google obviously caught now gaming their algorithms to bury certain topics.
[03:03:53.860 --> 03:04:00.422]  You had an article up on Infowars.com, the headline, Google to target criticism of Islam, a new censorship purge.
[03:04:00.842 --> 03:04:03.824]  And again, very few people picked up on this.
[03:04:03.824 --> 03:04:15.693]  They announced that they would be censoring, quote, upsetting offensive content on Google, burying search results, directly manipulating the information, which is what they accuse us of doing.
[03:04:16.153 --> 03:04:28.488]  Now if you look at the reasons given for declaring something, quote, upsetting, offensive, the example that is provided is a website that says Islam is intolerant.
[03:04:28.488 --> 03:04:31.692]  Now whether you want to talk about acid attacks, people having their
[03:04:31.972 --> 03:04:36.894]  Hands chopped off under Sharia law, stoning female rape victims to death.
[03:04:36.894 --> 03:04:38.415]  All those things happen.
[03:04:38.415 --> 03:04:42.556]  Many of them are supported by shockingly large numbers of Muslims.
[03:04:42.556 --> 03:04:50.300]  And in fact, we've got a new poll out of France which shows, again, shocking attitudes of intolerance amongst followers of Islam.
[03:04:50.300 --> 03:04:57.863]  So to make the statement that Islam is intolerant is complete fact, yet now they're declaring that as fake news.
[03:04:57.863 --> 03:04:58.383]  We'll be back.
[03:04:59.753 --> 03:05:07.799]  Judge Neil Gorsuch gave his opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday on the first day of hearings on his nomination to the U.S.
[03:05:07.799 --> 03:05:08.720]  Supreme Court.
[03:05:08.720 --> 03:05:23.091]  In it, he unpacked his views on the job of unelected judges in a democratic republic, giving his personal story and pledging to be a public servant who faithfully follows the Constitution and the laws enacted by the people's elected representatives.
[03:05:23.331 --> 03:05:37.055]  Judging is sometimes a lonely and hard job, Gorsuch mused in a wide-ranging speech that ranged from the dramatic to the humorous to reflections, at times showing deep passion and on two occasions even getting emotional.
[03:05:37.055 --> 03:05:44.177]  Today, Gorsuch sparred with Feinstein as well as other senators as they grilled him on his policies.
[03:05:44.177 --> 03:05:48.818]  It looks like that we're going to have a Supreme Court judge just like Antonin Scalia.
[03:05:49.218 --> 03:05:55.886]  Stay tuned to the Alex Jones Show at infowars.com slash show to follow the Senate hearings.
[03:05:59.645 --> 03:06:01.226]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:01.226 --> 03:06:06.468]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:06:06.468 --> 03:06:09.670]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:06:09.670 --> 03:06:15.473]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:06:15.473 --> 03:06:24.177]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:06:24.557 --> 03:06:30.125]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:06:30.125 --> 03:06:37.154]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:06:37.154 --> 03:06:41.720]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[03:06:41.980 --> 03:06:45.284]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[03:06:45.284 --> 03:06:47.366]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[03:06:55.534 --> 03:07:01.701]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:07:01.701 --> 03:07:03.162]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[03:07:03.162 --> 03:07:03.983]  Debit in Florida.
[03:07:03.983 --> 03:07:04.404]  You're on the air.
[03:07:05.379 --> 03:07:05.819]  Great!
[03:07:05.819 --> 03:07:06.940]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:07:06.940 --> 03:07:11.484]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:07:11.484 --> 03:07:13.185]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[03:07:13.185 --> 03:07:20.750]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:21.631]  Wow, thank you.
[03:07:21.631 --> 03:07:23.913]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[03:07:23.913 --> 03:07:25.554]  Which nutraceutical did you like best?
[03:07:25.794 --> 03:07:29.277]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[03:07:29.277 --> 03:07:29.658]  That's amazing.
[03:07:29.658 --> 03:07:30.539]  That's really incredible.
[03:07:30.539 --> 03:07:33.942]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:07:33.942 --> 03:07:34.963]  I haven't felt sleep.
[03:07:34.963 --> 03:07:36.624]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:07:36.624 --> 03:07:37.866]  And I love you guys.
[03:07:37.866 --> 03:07:40.028]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[03:07:40.028 --> 03:07:46.894]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:07:46.894 --> 03:07:47.935]  You will love it.
[03:07:47.935 --> 03:07:48.416]  I'm telling you.
[03:07:48.416 --> 03:07:49.757]  I've never bought a bad product.
[03:07:50.037 --> 03:07:54.464]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:54.464 --> 03:07:56.327]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[03:08:03.681 --> 03:08:12.287]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:12.287 --> 03:08:21.754]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:21.754 --> 03:08:22.654]  We are back.
[03:08:22.654 --> 03:08:24.656]  It's the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:24.656 --> 03:08:29.319]  Just touching on censorship, in particular Google censorship, before the break.
[03:08:30.871 --> 03:08:46.156]  YouTube, which of course is owned by Google, has introduced a new restricted mode for its platform where basically if you select this restricted mode you will be protected from offensive and upsetting content.
[03:08:46.156 --> 03:08:54.178]  The problem with that is that a bunch of LGBT groups came out and claimed that they were being unfairly discriminated against.
[03:08:54.178 --> 03:08:56.139]  Again, it's kind of ironic that they only get
[03:08:57.381 --> 03:09:00.762]  They only get angry about Google YouTube censorship when it affects them.
[03:09:00.762 --> 03:09:04.884]  We've been whining about it ad infinitum for months and months.
[03:09:04.884 --> 03:09:15.788]  But if you look at this Google censorship on YouTube, again owned by Google, the channels affected in restricted mode, guess which channels are affected?
[03:09:15.788 --> 03:09:23.131]  Guess which videos completely disappear when you look at the Alex Jones Channel, when you look at my channel?
[03:09:23.131 --> 03:09:23.651]  All of them!
[03:09:24.637 --> 03:09:35.179]  Every single video on YouTube's new restricted mode on my channel, on Alex Jones' channel, completely disappears when you select this option.
[03:09:35.179 --> 03:09:40.681]  Which channels are unaffected by this new restricted mode introduced by YouTube?
[03:09:40.681 --> 03:09:42.441]  Well, imagine my shock!
[03:09:42.441 --> 03:09:43.781]  It's CNN!
[03:09:43.781 --> 03:09:45.722]  It's CNBC!
[03:09:45.722 --> 03:09:51.023]  Even though, in many of their videos, they're covering the exact same news stories that we are.
[03:09:51.523 --> 03:09:55.628]  In our videos, there's no nudity, there's no violence.
[03:09:55.628 --> 03:09:57.850]  In many of them, there's not even any bad language.
[03:09:57.850 --> 03:10:02.435]  We're covering the exact same stories as CNBC, as CNN.
[03:10:02.435 --> 03:10:05.938]  Not a single one of their videos is restricted.
[03:10:06.579 --> 03:10:08.100]  In restricted mode.
[03:10:08.100 --> 03:10:12.183]  So you go on CNN's channel, every single video is available to watch.
[03:10:12.183 --> 03:10:17.206]  You go on the Alex Jones Channel, not a single video is up there.
[03:10:17.206 --> 03:10:22.509]  So obviously they're using this to target people who they don't like politically.
[03:10:22.509 --> 03:10:30.695]  It's not about protecting people from nudity or violence, they're using it to censor free speech yet another way.
[03:10:31.533 --> 03:10:56.186]  And we're talking about this, of course, because McClatchy came out with a big report last night confirming that the FBI is investigating RT, Breitbart, Sputnik and Infowars for links with the Kremlin, basically arguing on a completely baseless conspiracy theory that we're somehow coordinating with Putin's troll-bot army to spread information
[03:10:57.006 --> 03:11:00.909]  Before the election to sink Hillary Clinton and to help Donald Trump.
[03:11:00.909 --> 03:11:05.232]  As we document in this article, well let's take it from this angle for a start.
[03:11:06.260 --> 03:11:07.881]  This is, of course, all about fake news.
[03:11:07.881 --> 03:11:16.808]  They want to create the pretext that we're fake news, that we're discredited, that we can be censored on all these social media platforms.
[03:11:16.808 --> 03:11:17.749]  How do they do that?
[03:11:17.749 --> 03:11:19.650]  Well, they say we're spreading this fake news.
[03:11:19.650 --> 03:11:23.293]  It's put out there deliberately to deceive people to make money.
[03:11:23.293 --> 03:11:26.656]  Of course, that's a completely different category.
[03:11:26.656 --> 03:11:28.718]  There are individuals who do that.
[03:11:28.718 --> 03:11:30.059]  We've never done that.
[03:11:30.059 --> 03:11:30.999]  But the point is this.
[03:11:30.999 --> 03:11:34.002]  Stanford University came out with a major study
[03:11:34.602 --> 03:11:37.123]  A couple of months ago into fake news.
[03:11:37.123 --> 03:11:43.505]  They found, and you can go and read the study for yourself, that it had absolutely no impact on the U.S.
[03:11:43.505 --> 03:11:45.466]  presidential election.
[03:11:45.466 --> 03:11:51.928]  So before you even get into an argument about who's pushing fake news, doesn't it even matter?
[03:11:51.928 --> 03:11:54.709]  Had no impact whatsoever on the U.S.
[03:11:54.709 --> 03:11:55.210]  election.
[03:11:55.210 --> 03:11:57.490]  There you see the headline.
[03:11:57.490 --> 03:11:58.711]  In fact they went into the
[03:11:59.964 --> 03:12:07.168]  Drilled down into the numbers of this study and found that, if anything, fake news benefited Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:07.168 --> 03:12:13.672]  Because the fake news articles that were spread most were beneficial to, were positive about, Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:14.437 --> 03:12:25.241]  Yeah, they've spun this entire narrative that Donald Trump won the election because of fake news being coordinated by Vladimir Putin's trollbot army.
[03:12:25.241 --> 03:12:26.502]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[03:12:26.502 --> 03:12:29.503]  Of course, we're going to get into it in a second.
[03:12:29.503 --> 03:12:34.185]  The only people that manipulated public opinion, that manipulated news feeds,
[03:12:35.154 --> 03:12:40.598]  Were Google, Facebook and Twitter the very thing they accuse us of doing?
[03:12:40.598 --> 03:12:55.768]  But it's interesting to look back as to the source, the individual who originated this deluded, baseless conspiracy theory that we are somehow in control of the Putin trollbot army or we're coordinating with them.
[03:12:56.707 --> 03:13:06.194]  It of course traces back to an individual by the name of Louise Mensch, who is now living in America, but was a former Tory MP, now a journalist.
[03:13:07.188 --> 03:13:11.350]  And is known for some, let's just say, quite kooky theories.
[03:13:11.350 --> 03:13:18.933]  One of which is that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the assassination of Andrew Breitbart.
[03:13:18.933 --> 03:13:31.579]  And in fact, we've got a clip from a recent interview she did with the BBC, where even the BBC host basically owns her in the argument, because she sounds absolutely insane when she tries to make this argument.
[03:13:31.579 --> 03:13:32.419]  Let's go to the clip.
[03:13:33.695 --> 03:13:35.616]  You've also claimed- As an adjunct.
[03:13:35.616 --> 03:13:40.900]  You've also- So, just to be clear, we don't really have hard evidence yet whether this warrant exists.
[03:13:40.900 --> 03:13:42.220]  It may or it may not.
[03:13:42.220 --> 03:13:43.521]  There is some doubt about the evidence.
[03:13:43.521 --> 03:13:44.602]  There's lots of claims.
[03:13:44.602 --> 03:13:48.064]  Whether there's evidence about Mr. Trump and the Russians is another matter.
[03:13:48.064 --> 03:13:52.507]  And you've also claimed that President Putin had Andrew Breitbart murdered.
[03:13:53.047 --> 03:14:02.295]  To pave the way for Steve Bannon, this was the man who founded the Breitbart website, to pave the way for Steve Bannon to play a key role in the Trump administration.
[03:14:02.295 --> 03:14:07.239]  You then said that Mr. Bannon is behind bomb threats to Jewish community centers.
[03:14:07.239 --> 03:14:11.023]  I mean, aren't you in danger of just peddling wild conspiracy theories?
[03:14:12.481 --> 03:14:14.483]  No, first of all, I haven't.
[03:14:14.483 --> 03:14:18.306]  And no matter how many times people say this, it's not going to be true.
[03:14:18.306 --> 03:14:22.650]  I said on Twitter, in a tweet, I believe that to be the case, about the murder of Andrew Breitbart.
[03:14:22.650 --> 03:14:24.872]  That's what I just said!
[03:14:24.872 --> 03:14:28.055]  You believe President Putin murdered him, don't you?
[03:14:28.055 --> 03:14:30.257]  Andrew, I believe it.
[03:14:30.257 --> 03:14:31.318]  You said I reported it.
[03:14:31.318 --> 03:14:32.879]  Those are two completely different things.
[03:14:32.879 --> 03:14:33.940]  Well, you put it out on Twitter.
[03:14:33.940 --> 03:14:36.762]  You said you believed it, and you don't have a shred of evidence.
[03:14:36.762 --> 03:14:36.983]  I do.
[03:14:38.595 --> 03:14:40.556]  Indeed, I made no assertion myself.
[03:14:40.556 --> 03:14:41.657]  I believe there is a difference.
[03:14:41.657 --> 03:14:42.397]  Why should I believe it?
[03:14:48.453 --> 03:14:49.194]  I didn't say.
[03:14:49.194 --> 03:14:53.797]  Look, you may believe there are fairies at the bottom of your garden.
[03:14:53.797 --> 03:14:54.858]  It doesn't make it true.
[03:14:54.858 --> 03:14:55.679]  I may indeed.
[03:14:55.679 --> 03:14:58.461]  And if I say so, then that's my belief.
[03:14:58.461 --> 03:15:06.408]  If I say this is, I am reporting as I did with the FISA warrant, that a FISA warrant exists, you may rest assured that I have a basis in fact for a report.
[03:15:06.408 --> 03:15:08.129]  A belief is just a belief.
[03:15:08.129 --> 03:15:09.450]  So let me just get the working.
[03:15:09.450 --> 03:15:10.671]  I will report upon it.
[03:15:11.071 --> 03:15:15.574]  No, look, I know you're relatively new to journalism, so let me just get the rules right.
[03:15:15.574 --> 03:15:23.779]  If it's Twitter, we don't believe it, but if it's on your website, we should believe it.
[03:15:25.515 --> 03:15:30.118]  If I report something and I say, this happened, then I'm making an assertion.
[03:15:30.118 --> 03:15:32.640]  If I describe a belief, I'm describing a belief.
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:37.423]  I know subtlety may be a little difficult for you, but this is a difference between a report and a belief.
[03:15:37.423 --> 03:15:43.227]  No, no, I just think that if you want to be a journalist, beliefs have to be backed up with some evidence.
[03:15:43.227 --> 03:15:43.567]  Really?
[03:15:43.567 --> 03:15:46.149]  Do you have a faith?
[03:15:46.149 --> 03:15:51.633]  Well, it's not a matter of faith, or maybe in your case, that President Putin murdered Andrew Breitbart.
[03:15:53.075 --> 03:16:00.417]  A belief and a report are two different things, and no matter how often you say that they are the same, they will never be the same.
[03:16:00.417 --> 03:16:11.260]  You've said in today's Sunday Times here in London that you've turned into, I quote your words, that you're a temporary superpower, where you quote, see things really clearly.
[03:16:11.260 --> 03:16:12.920]  I mean, have you become delusional?
[03:16:14.614 --> 03:16:20.118]  No, I'm describing a biological basis for ADHD, which I have.
[03:16:20.118 --> 03:16:27.623]  Which, as any of your viewers or doctors will know, provides people with, unfortunately, a lot of scattered focus.
[03:16:27.623 --> 03:16:40.352]  They're very messy, absent-minded professors, but when they're interested in things, and they have ADHD, they can have a condition called hyperfocus, which means that you concentrate very hard on a given subject, and you can see patterns and connections.
[03:16:40.352 --> 03:16:43.234]  That's biological, and I don't resolve from it for a moment.
[03:16:43.514 --> 03:16:44.696]  All right, thank you very much.
[03:16:44.696 --> 03:16:47.420]  Louise Benson for getting up early in New York.
[03:16:47.420 --> 03:16:51.286]  You are the first time ever I've interviewed a temporary superpower.
[03:16:51.286 --> 03:16:53.128]  Thank you for that.
[03:16:53.128 --> 03:16:54.570]  You're so lucky, you're so lucky.
[03:16:54.570 --> 03:16:56.173]  Yeah, I don't think it's going to happen again.
[03:16:57.182 --> 03:16:59.884]  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:16:59.884 --> 03:17:09.511]  That is the impeccable source of the claim that Infowars worked with Russian trollbot armies to swing the election for Donald Trump.
[03:17:09.511 --> 03:17:11.873]  That's their impeccable source right there.
[03:17:11.873 --> 03:17:19.878]  A woman who believes that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the assassination of Andrew Breitbart.
[03:17:19.878 --> 03:17:25.763]  A woman who believes that she's got superpowers that allow her to see connections where no one else can.
[03:17:26.565 --> 03:17:33.210]  A woman who was exposed as being, again imagine my shock, a Hillary Clinton sycophant.
[03:17:33.210 --> 03:17:43.117]  Again, this is the woman who wrote the article before the election, October 2016 for Heat Street, claiming that we were working with Russian trollbots.
[03:17:43.117 --> 03:17:44.898]  This is the individual.
[03:17:44.898 --> 03:17:46.399]  This is the source.
[03:17:46.399 --> 03:17:49.642]  This is also the woman who was exposed in WikiLeaks emails.
[03:17:50.612 --> 03:17:54.417]  The John Podesta emails as being a Hillary Clinton sycophant.
[03:17:54.417 --> 03:17:55.898]  This is out of Breitbart.
[03:17:55.898 --> 03:17:59.403]  WikiLeaks anti-SJW Heat Street founder Louise Mensch.
[03:17:59.403 --> 03:18:01.325]  She poses as a conservative.
[03:18:01.325 --> 03:18:02.847]  She's a never-Trumper.
[03:18:02.847 --> 03:18:05.710]  Pitched ad script to Hillary Clinton campaign.
[03:18:06.601 --> 03:18:21.896]  And it goes through and quotes the email where she prostrates herself and genuflects to Podesta, to the Hillary Clinton campaign, begging to allow her to write this feminist Hillary Clinton ad.
[03:18:21.896 --> 03:18:23.037]  This is the source!
[03:18:24.098 --> 03:18:27.359]  The FBI's investigation into these claims.
[03:18:27.359 --> 03:18:33.502]  She wrote a huge, rambling article claiming that we were working with Russian troll bots.
[03:18:33.502 --> 03:18:37.423]  It was completely debunked, completely eviscerated.
[03:18:37.423 --> 03:18:46.007]  In the months since, she went basically further off the wagon with more crazy claims, such as the ones you just heard in that interview.
[03:18:46.007 --> 03:18:51.369]  She's basically a laughingstock in the journalism world, and this is the impeccable source.
[03:18:52.438 --> 03:18:58.162]  Which the FBI is now investigating the claims that originated with her.
[03:18:58.162 --> 03:19:05.046]  Absolutely ludicrous, as our article up on Infowars.com details.
[03:19:05.046 --> 03:19:13.192]  It also details the fact that, again, the Stanford University study found fake news had no impact on the outcome of the election.
[03:19:13.192 --> 03:19:19.556]  So before you even get into an argument about who was behind so-called fake news, it didn't even matter!
[03:19:19.556 --> 03:19:20.957]  Trump would have won anyway!
[03:19:21.744 --> 03:19:26.649]  In fact, as I said, the fake news benefited Hillary more than Trump.
[03:19:26.649 --> 03:19:28.511]  That's what the study found.
[03:19:28.511 --> 03:19:33.156]  The fake news about Hillary was more beneficial towards her campaign.
[03:19:33.156 --> 03:19:35.539]  It circulated more on social media.
[03:19:36.727 --> 03:19:40.568]  Then we're going to get into Facebook, we're going to get into Google, we're going to get into Twitter.
[03:19:40.568 --> 03:19:53.773]  How they provably manipulated their own algorithms, directed their own employees to bury conservative-friendly news topics throughout the election to benefit Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:53.773 --> 03:19:56.895]  They did what the FBI is accusing us of doing.
[03:19:56.895 --> 03:19:57.555]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:59.298 --> 03:20:10.167]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:10.167 --> 03:20:14.310]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:20:14.310 --> 03:20:16.472]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:16.472 --> 03:20:21.916]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:22.076 --> 03:20:32.085]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:32.085 --> 03:20:38.551]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:38.551 --> 03:20:41.874]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:20:41.874 --> 03:20:43.936]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:43.936 --> 03:20:47.039]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:47.099 --> 03:20:49.521]  Are you putting your money into an IRA, pension or 401k?
[03:20:49.521 --> 03:20:52.622]  Then I hope you're prepared to lose 30, 40, 50% or more of your retirement savings.
[03:20:52.622 --> 03:20:55.044]  Because it's not a question of if the market crashes again.
[03:20:55.044 --> 03:20:56.165]  It's a question of when.
[03:20:56.165 --> 03:20:56.705]  It's going to happen.
[03:21:13.095 --> 03:21:18.359]  Did you know there is a way you can protect and grow your wealth safely and predictably every single year?
[03:21:18.359 --> 03:21:25.724]  The people using this approach didn't lose a penny when the market crashed in 2000 or 2008, and they won't lose a penny in the next crash.
[03:21:25.724 --> 03:21:32.609]  In fact, their money will continue to grow safely year in and year out, even when stocks, real estate, and other investments tumble.
[03:21:32.609 --> 03:21:35.671]  A free report detailing this savings program is now available.

[03:22:04.133 --> 03:22:09.374]  It may not sound like a lot of money, but it's enough to turn 500 strangers into 500 connections.

[03:24:16.858 --> 03:24:18.739]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:18.739 --> 03:24:25.242]  Before we get back into the news, I want to tell you about what we have available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:24:25.242 --> 03:24:27.003]  We say it almost every day now.
[03:24:27.003 --> 03:24:31.145]  We're under attack in one form or another if it's not the mainstream media.
[03:24:31.145 --> 03:24:34.766]  It's the federal government itself we have available now.
[03:24:34.766 --> 03:24:36.467]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:24:36.467 --> 03:24:38.528]  State-of-the-art defender body armor.
[03:24:38.988 --> 03:24:44.392]  Infowars has always been obsessed with bringing you the absolute best products out there for the lowest prices.
[03:24:44.392 --> 03:24:52.198]  And now we've teamed up with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced body armor used by the U.S.
[03:24:52.198 --> 03:24:55.121]  military, no less, and law enforcement.
[03:24:55.121 --> 03:24:57.443]  It's available at infowarsstore.com.
[03:24:57.443 --> 03:25:03.747]  It's certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN pistol rounds.
[03:25:04.508 --> 03:25:05.329]  And you know why not?
[03:25:05.329 --> 03:25:09.371]  I mean, many on the left actually want a civil war in America right now.
[03:25:09.371 --> 03:25:11.312]  That's how hysterical they are.
[03:25:11.312 --> 03:25:17.917]  You have Sweden preparing for a Russian invasion, reopening their nuclear bunkers.
[03:25:17.917 --> 03:25:22.820]  Stuff might get crazy in a very short amount of time.
[03:25:22.820 --> 03:25:26.522]  We have the Defender body armor available at Infowars.store.com.
[03:25:26.522 --> 03:25:26.783]  It is
[03:25:27.763 --> 03:25:33.770]  Uses one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[03:25:33.770 --> 03:25:37.273]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:25:37.273 --> 03:25:41.938]  This is the body armor of choice from the Department of Defense.
[03:25:41.938 --> 03:25:45.442]  They chose it to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:25:45.442 --> 03:25:48.445]  It reduces body trauma to the lowest possible level.
[03:25:48.445 --> 03:25:49.726]  Basically, it works.
[03:25:50.521 --> 03:26:01.528]  And who wouldn't want to be making every preparation right now, given the absolute hysteria that still continues to sweep America in the aftermath of Donald Trump's victory.
[03:26:01.528 --> 03:26:02.869]  So support us.
[03:26:02.869 --> 03:26:04.149]  We're under attack.
[03:26:04.149 --> 03:26:08.212]  It's not a cliché when the FBI is directly investigating us.
[03:26:08.212 --> 03:26:13.355]  Please support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:26:13.355 --> 03:26:15.837]  Finishing up on what we were talking about before the break again.
[03:26:16.832 --> 03:26:22.939]  Louise Mensch, the woman who thinks she has superpowers to spot patterns that other people just can't.
[03:26:22.939 --> 03:26:34.273]  The woman who wrote a fawning email to John Podesta, to the Clinton campaign, begging, genuflecting for them to allow her to write this feminist Hillary campaign ad.
[03:26:34.793 --> 03:26:45.319]  She's the source of this ridiculous conspiracy theory that we were working with the Russian troll bots to sink Hillary Clinton to ensure Donald Trump won the presidency.
[03:26:45.319 --> 03:26:47.340]  She's the source of that.
[03:26:47.340 --> 03:26:50.742]  Not a very credible source, to say the least.
[03:26:50.742 --> 03:26:54.625]  But then you can look at Twitter, you can look at Facebook, you can look at Google.
[03:26:54.625 --> 03:27:01.669]  Again, if the FBI wants to investigate someone for manipulating public opinion before the election,
[03:27:02.458 --> 03:27:06.359]  Twitter, Facebook, Google are the prime suspects.
[03:27:06.359 --> 03:27:16.862]  And we document that in this article up on Infowars.com, red-linked, why the FBI's Infowars Russia investigation is completely ludicrous, and I break it down.
[03:27:16.862 --> 03:27:23.544]  Two months before the election, and we reported on it at the time, psychologist Robert Epstein and SourceFeed's Matt Lieberman
[03:27:24.224 --> 03:27:35.278]  Both exposed how Google was manipulating search results in relation to Hillary Clinton to ensure autocomplete suggestions were bias in favour of Clinton.
[03:27:35.278 --> 03:27:36.018]  That is a quote!
[03:27:37.426 --> 03:27:40.647]  And you see an example in the article, we include the screenshot.
[03:27:40.647 --> 03:27:49.951]  People would type in, Hillary Clinton is, into a Google search engine, Google only returned positive search results.
[03:27:49.951 --> 03:27:58.435]  You type the same search term into other search engines, such as Bing and Yahoo, you got different suggested results.
[03:27:58.435 --> 03:28:01.876]  You got Hillary Clinton is a liar, or Hillary Clinton is a criminal.
[03:28:03.072 --> 03:28:04.893]  What did you get on Google.com?
[03:28:04.893 --> 03:28:07.815]  You can see the example right there if you zoom in.
[03:28:07.815 --> 03:28:10.257]  Basically, Hillary Clinton is God.
[03:28:10.257 --> 03:28:11.898]  Bow down and worship her.
[03:28:11.898 --> 03:28:16.681]  And of course we know, Google is deeply in bed with the Obama administration.
[03:28:16.681 --> 03:28:19.943]  According to Epstein, the psychologist who was quoted by SourceFeed,
[03:28:20.723 --> 03:28:26.068]  This had the potential to shift as many as 3 million votes.
[03:28:26.068 --> 03:28:32.053]  Google directly manipulating its own search engine in favour of Hillary Clinton.
[03:28:32.053 --> 03:28:36.778]  Direct evidence of what they accuse us of doing with no evidence.
[03:28:36.778 --> 03:28:46.046]  WikiLeaks emails also revealed that John Podesta, Hillary's campaign manager, sought to have, quote, discreet conversation with the likes of Apple, Facebook and Google.
[03:28:46.046 --> 03:28:47.107]  Then you look at Facebook.
[03:28:48.163 --> 03:28:51.305]  Mark Zuckerberg wanted to meet up with the Clinton campaign.
[03:28:51.305 --> 03:28:57.928]  Their Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg, did meet with Clinton Chief of Staff Sheryl Mills in 2015.
[03:28:57.928 --> 03:29:07.132]  And we also know the story of how Facebook buried conservative trends, removed them from their trending list,
[03:29:07.672 --> 03:29:15.380]  Ordered their employees to remove conservative-friendly trends and inject fake, artificial trends into that list.
[03:29:15.380 --> 03:29:17.783]  Again, to manipulate public opinion.
[03:29:17.783 --> 03:29:22.468]  You look at Twitter, burying hashtags that were negative towards Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:22.468 --> 03:29:25.251]  Which Hillary, and which Hillary censored.
[03:29:25.251 --> 03:29:26.733]  Those hashtags were banned.
[03:29:27.373 --> 03:29:30.115]  That was manipulating public opinion.
[03:29:30.115 --> 03:29:41.544]  There are numerous more examples where Twitter, Facebook, Google were caught doing what the FBI accuses us of doing with absolutely no evidence whatsoever.
[03:29:41.544 --> 03:29:43.866]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:29:43.866 --> 03:29:48.169]  BreakingNewsInfoWars.com.
[03:29:48.169 --> 03:29:49.570]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.570 --> 03:29:52.112]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.112 --> 03:29:54.794]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.170 --> 03:30:01.994]  Ashley Beckford here for InfoWars.com.
[03:30:01.994 --> 03:30:08.562]  DHS releases list of 118 jurisdictions ignoring immigration laws.
[03:30:08.562 --> 03:30:16.332]  That's right, Travis County, Texas, the home of InfoWars.com, deep in the heart of Texas, is the worst offender with 142 illegals released.
[03:30:18.294 --> 03:30:21.357]  Clifford Cunningham has this report on InfoWars.com.
[03:30:21.357 --> 03:30:34.027]  The Department of Homeland Security has released its first list of jurisdictions that ignore federal immigration law, indicating nearly 200 illegal immigrants sought for deportation were released instead.
[03:30:34.027 --> 03:30:40.392]  The name and shame list was ordered released by President Donald Trump when he signed two executive orders.
[03:30:40.632 --> 03:30:43.034]  Stay tuned for more immigration news at Infowars.com slash show.
[03:30:58.883 --> 03:31:00.764]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:00.764 --> 03:31:02.786]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:02.786 --> 03:31:05.688]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:05.688 --> 03:31:11.752]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:11.752 --> 03:31:20.958]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:31:20.958 --> 03:31:25.801]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[03:31:26.021 --> 03:31:28.463]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:28.463 --> 03:31:36.509]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:36.509 --> 03:31:37.490]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:38.682 --> 03:31:42.626]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:42.626 --> 03:31:46.209]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:46.209 --> 03:31:52.914]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:52.914 --> 03:31:57.018]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:59.179 --> 03:32:03.363]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[03:32:03.363 --> 03:32:06.145]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[03:32:06.145 --> 03:32:07.666]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[03:32:07.666 --> 03:32:11.890]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[03:32:11.890 --> 03:32:15.673]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[03:32:15.673 --> 03:32:17.375]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[03:32:17.375 --> 03:32:18.936]  It's gonna be coming after your gun.
[03:32:18.936 --> 03:32:19.337]  Oh, yeah.
[03:32:19.337 --> 03:32:21.478]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[03:32:21.478 --> 03:32:22.099]  At all.
[03:32:22.099 --> 03:32:23.140]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[03:32:23.140 --> 03:32:25.542]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:32:25.542 --> 03:32:26.263]  They lost.
[03:32:26.823 --> 03:32:27.543]  We won.
[03:32:27.543 --> 03:32:29.884]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[03:32:29.884 --> 03:32:31.044]  It's time to ride, boss.
[03:32:31.044 --> 03:32:32.944]  We need a thousand Paula beers.
[03:32:32.944 --> 03:32:39.006]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[03:32:39.006 --> 03:32:41.346]  And beef was for supper.
[03:32:41.346 --> 03:32:43.967]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:32:43.967 --> 03:32:45.708]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:32:45.708 --> 03:32:47.308]  DVDs now available.
[03:32:47.308 --> 03:32:51.629]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:32:52.009 --> 03:32:55.350]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:32:55.350 --> 03:32:57.691]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[03:32:57.691 --> 03:33:05.533]  Let's fix it!
[03:33:05.533 --> 03:33:06.753]  You found it!
[03:33:06.753 --> 03:33:08.814]  The tip of the spear!
[03:33:08.814 --> 03:33:11.815]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:11.815 --> 03:33:15.756]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson!
[03:33:24.540 --> 03:33:39.691]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show live and, you know, it's interesting, Rasmussen Reports came out with a poll today saying that 50% of likely US voters approve of President Trump's job performance, so basically has a 50% approval rating.
[03:33:39.691 --> 03:33:51.540]  That contradicts with the poll released by Gallup yesterday which said that only 37% of Americans supported Trump, that he only had a 37% approval rating.
[03:33:51.540 --> 03:33:52.140]  The question is,
[03:33:53.121 --> 03:33:55.343]  Who is Gallup sampling?
[03:33:55.343 --> 03:34:05.650]  Who are they asking to get this result, given the wide margin of difference between the Gallup poll and the Rasmussen poll, a 13% difference?
[03:34:05.650 --> 03:34:08.872]  Well, I asked Gallup to provide their sampling.
[03:34:08.872 --> 03:34:14.496]  They've got a website where it says contact Gallup if you want further information on the sampling for our polls.
[03:34:14.496 --> 03:34:17.258]  So I did that via email, via Twitter.
[03:34:18.568 --> 03:34:21.953]  28 hours ago now, no response, nothing whatsoever.
[03:34:21.953 --> 03:34:27.060]  I was simply asking, give me information on the sampling for your poll.
[03:34:27.060 --> 03:34:29.123]  How many Democrats did you ask?
[03:34:29.123 --> 03:34:30.665]  How many Independents did you ask?
[03:34:30.665 --> 03:34:32.728]  How many Republicans did you ask?
[03:34:32.728 --> 03:34:34.430]  Because before the election,
[03:34:35.290 --> 03:34:45.723]  And this was one of the reasons why people were so shocked that Huffington Post could report Hillary Clinton 98% chance of winning the election and then for her to lose.
[03:34:45.723 --> 03:34:52.511]  Of course, the polls before the election oversampled Democrats in almost every case.
[03:34:52.511 --> 03:34:54.373]  You can look at the polls for the debates.
[03:34:55.239 --> 03:35:06.221]  In the immediate aftermath of the debates, the CNN-ORC polls always oversampled Democrats because, of course, that makes it more likely to get the result they want.
[03:35:06.221 --> 03:35:11.622]  So only 37% approval rating for Trump according to this Gallup poll.
[03:35:11.622 --> 03:35:12.882]  Who are they sampling?
[03:35:12.882 --> 03:35:14.023]  Who are they asking?
[03:35:14.023 --> 03:35:18.724]  Well, I asked them and they have completely failed to provide an answer.
[03:35:18.724 --> 03:35:19.584]  More than 24 hours later,
[03:35:21.320 --> 03:35:22.561]  Unacceptable.
[03:35:22.561 --> 03:35:26.162]  Which, of course, suggests that they're hiding something.
[03:35:26.162 --> 03:35:27.783]  They don't even put it on their website.
[03:35:27.783 --> 03:35:35.887]  How simple would it be to say, this poll sampled X percent of Democrats, X percent of Independents, X percent of Republicans.
[03:35:35.887 --> 03:35:37.047]  They don't do that.
[03:35:37.047 --> 03:35:40.809]  And when you ask them about it, they don't respond.
[03:35:40.809 --> 03:35:42.349]  Very suspicious.
[03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:46.351]  If this is a fair poll, give us the sampling and we'll move on.
[03:35:46.351 --> 03:35:47.992]  But they haven't done that.
[03:35:47.992 --> 03:35:48.872]  More than 24 hours later.
[03:35:50.393 --> 03:35:53.356]  Very interesting indeed.
[03:35:53.356 --> 03:35:56.579]  We have a top story up on InfoWars.com.
[03:35:56.579 --> 03:35:57.940]  I posted this about an hour ago.
[03:35:59.076 --> 03:36:00.337]  Study.
[03:36:00.337 --> 03:36:04.598]  One third of young Muslims in France think terrorism is acceptable.
[03:36:04.598 --> 03:36:06.920]  Oh, religion of peace strikes again.
[03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:15.123]  So basically they had this big study conducted immediately after the Paris attacks in 2015, November 13 attacks.
[03:36:15.123 --> 03:36:24.847]  They asked almost 7,000 high school students in France, 25% of whom were Muslims, they asked them a bunch of different questions.
[03:36:24.847 --> 03:36:25.868]  And what did they discover?
[03:36:26.872 --> 03:36:36.596]  They discovered, and bearing in mind this study has been received very badly by the French media because it's, quote, not politically correct.
[03:36:36.596 --> 03:36:46.560]  It literally says that in one of the articles that we have to be very careful about the results of this study because the facts are not politically correct.
[03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:50.002]  Well, the facts are the facts of the facts and these are the facts.
[03:36:50.002 --> 03:36:55.844]  According to this study, a young Muslim is four times more likely to adhere to radical beliefs than a Christian.
[03:36:58.554 --> 03:37:11.299]  33% of Muslim students in this poll consider it acceptable, that's a quote, acceptable to, quote, participate in violent actions for ideas.
[03:37:11.299 --> 03:37:12.879]  Which is obviously terrorism.
[03:37:12.879 --> 03:37:16.221]  Violence in pursuit of political goals is terrorism.
[03:37:16.221 --> 03:37:20.943]  That's the very definition of terrorism.
[03:37:20.943 --> 03:37:25.625]  33% of young Muslims asked in this survey said they found that acceptable.
[03:37:27.183 --> 03:37:35.110]  20% of Muslim students agreed with the statement that it was acceptable to stand up for your religion with weapons.
[03:37:35.110 --> 03:37:39.434]  And again, bear in mind, these are the ones who just admit to it.
[03:37:39.434 --> 03:37:51.825]  If you have 33% of Muslim students saying that they're sympathetic with terrorism, using violence to further your ideological goals, how many of them didn't admit to that but believed it anyway?
[03:37:52.697 --> 03:37:55.359]  You know, we had a poll in the UK a few months back.
[03:37:55.359 --> 03:38:00.623]  52% of Muslims living in the UK think homosexuality should be criminalized.
[03:38:00.623 --> 03:38:03.846]  They think gay people should be thrown in cages.
[03:38:03.846 --> 03:38:09.310]  But again, 52% a majority, but how many of them didn't admit to it?
[03:38:09.310 --> 03:38:15.475]  After all, the Quran says that you can lie to infidels, so how many more believe it but don't admit to it?
[03:38:15.475 --> 03:38:18.858]  But even the ones that do admit to it, those numbers are shocking enough.
[03:38:21.289 --> 03:38:28.723]  24% of those surveyed in this study, out of the whole sample, bearing in mind only 25% of this sample are Muslims, the other 75% on,
[03:38:31.229 --> 03:38:39.571]  But still, 24% of those surveyed refused to fully condemn the Charlie Hebdo killings.
[03:38:39.571 --> 03:38:45.693]  24% of young people in this poll of almost 7,000 students in France.
[03:38:45.693 --> 03:38:48.334]  And again, that's the whole sample.
[03:38:48.334 --> 03:38:58.337]  That's not just amongst Muslims, and yet you've still got a number of 24% refusing to fully condemn the massacre of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists.
[03:38:58.337 --> 03:38:59.517]  Bataclan massacre.
[03:39:00.455 --> 03:39:03.677]  Which of course happened during the November 13th Paris attack.
[03:39:03.677 --> 03:39:05.337]  Absolutely horrific incident.
[03:39:05.337 --> 03:39:08.139]  89 people dead.
[03:39:08.139 --> 03:39:16.063]  21% of students surveyed in this poll refused to fully condemn the Bataclan massacre.
[03:39:16.063 --> 03:39:18.644]  Again, that is the whole survey.
[03:39:18.644 --> 03:39:25.047]  If you broke it down, which they didn't, conveniently enough, because we can't break it down too much, can we?
[03:39:25.047 --> 03:39:27.649]  Because again, that's not politically correct.
[03:39:28.988 --> 03:39:30.450]  To know the truth.
[03:39:30.450 --> 03:39:37.459]  But if you broke it down, if you only took the Muslim students out of that poll, that number would of course be way higher.
[03:39:38.803 --> 03:39:42.625]  Now we've seen this kind of thing before, but this just emphasizes it once again.
[03:39:42.625 --> 03:40:03.113]  Because we had the Pew Global Attitude Study in 2006, which found that 42% of Muslims in France aged between 18 and 29, so young Muslims living in France, 42% of them thought that suicide bombings were sometimes justified.
[03:40:03.113 --> 03:40:04.534]  So you've got almost half
[03:40:05.652 --> 03:40:13.860]  of young Muslims in France who think that under certain circumstances suicide bombings are justified.
[03:40:13.860 --> 03:40:19.706]  And these opinions are echoed across Europe, or even worse when you look at attitudes in the Middle East.
[03:40:19.706 --> 03:40:21.608]  Islam is not a religion of peace.
[03:40:21.608 --> 03:40:23.830]  We've proven it again and again and again.
[03:40:24.912 --> 03:40:29.394]  How did Le Monde react to this survey, the left-wing French newspaper?
[03:40:29.394 --> 03:40:33.696]  Well, they attacked the researchers for stating the fact.
[03:40:33.696 --> 03:40:39.738]  They said that it was like opening Pandora's box, because God forbid we would learn the truth.
[03:40:39.738 --> 03:40:43.820]  And in these articles, which are in French, they were translated by the Westmonster website,
[03:40:45.387 --> 03:40:48.748]  They basically say we have to withhold the full results of this study.
[03:40:48.748 --> 03:40:50.569]  We can't break it down too much.
[03:40:50.569 --> 03:40:55.971]  We have to delay the release of this further until after the election.
[03:40:55.971 --> 03:40:58.752]  The first round of which takes place in about a month's time.
[03:40:58.752 --> 03:41:04.394]  And of course, Maureen Le Pen is the anti-immigration candidate.
[03:41:04.394 --> 03:41:07.215]  They don't want this to benefit her.
[03:41:07.215 --> 03:41:10.396]  So they're talking about delaying the release of the full results.
[03:41:11.966 --> 03:41:12.966]  Censorship.
[03:41:12.966 --> 03:41:20.068]  Because again, as one of the journalists remarks, these results are not politically correct.
[03:41:20.068 --> 03:41:31.111]  We don't want the public to know the full scope of what is happening in France, where on an almost daily basis there is some kind of terrorist incident.
[03:41:31.111 --> 03:41:32.472]  Now, a few days ago we had
[03:41:33.826 --> 03:41:41.168]  A father and his son having their throats slashed in the street in a quote, trendy area of Paris.
[03:41:41.168 --> 03:41:46.330]  We had the incident a few days ago at the airport, second biggest airport in Paris.
[03:41:46.330 --> 03:41:48.451]  Again, jihadist tries to grab
[03:41:49.679 --> 03:41:54.761]  A soldier's gone, tries to go on a rampage, luckily shot dead before he could do any damage.
[03:41:54.761 --> 03:41:58.183]  We have some kind of incident almost every single day in France.
[03:41:58.183 --> 03:42:05.045]  We've had 20 jihadist attacks in France since January 2015 alone.
[03:42:05.045 --> 03:42:07.226]  Since Charlie Hebdo.
[03:42:07.226 --> 03:42:11.208]  20 jihadist attacks in France alone.
[03:42:11.208 --> 03:42:18.211]  And is it any surprise, given these attitudes amongst young Muslims, most of whom were born in France,
[03:42:18.871 --> 03:42:20.693]  They're not even new immigrants.
[03:42:20.693 --> 03:42:24.676]  These are the supposedly integrated ones.
[03:42:24.676 --> 03:42:27.738]  This is the cultural enrichment that is taking place in Europe.
[03:42:27.738 --> 03:42:30.120]  It's absolutely chilling.
[03:42:30.120 --> 03:42:37.666]  Of course, what they're afraid of is the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, Marine Le Pen has 39% support amongst 18 to 24 year old French voters in France.
[03:42:43.783 --> 03:42:43.823]  39%!
[03:42:43.823 --> 03:42:49.205]  That's almost double her nearest rival, Macron, who is leading in the polls.
[03:42:49.205 --> 03:42:54.468]  But Le Pen has almost double the support amongst young people.
[03:42:54.468 --> 03:42:59.511]  And again, it's because the major parties have completely neglected young people.
[03:42:59.511 --> 03:43:06.995]  They only have support now amongst older people who are just desperate to keep their pensions and think that Le Pen is going to take away their pensions.
[03:43:08.049 --> 03:43:12.592]  But again, that emphasises populism is the new counterculture.
[03:43:12.592 --> 03:43:16.614]  Increasingly, we're capturing the youth vote.
[03:43:16.614 --> 03:43:20.216]  Every other message I get is from somebody aged 15, 16, 17.
[03:43:20.216 --> 03:43:27.160]  It's really encouraging to see that, and it's encouraging to see it in France.
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:37.026]  But is it really any surprise, given these horrific numbers that we see in this poll, with young Muslims thinking that a third of them
[03:43:37.870 --> 03:43:42.222]  Thinking that terrorism under certain circumstances is acceptable.
[03:43:42.222 --> 03:43:44.790]  Absolutely chilling.
[03:43:44.790 --> 03:43:46.053]  Meanwhile, over in Sweden...
[03:43:47.403 --> 03:43:49.765]  My favourite country, last night in Sweden.
[03:43:49.765 --> 03:43:59.493]  Sweden has let in about 150 ISIS terrorists, of course it's routinely in the top three for exporting terrorists to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS.
[03:43:59.493 --> 03:44:04.416]  They let them back in because they're liberal, because they're tolerant, they're progressive.
[03:44:04.416 --> 03:44:14.785]  In many cases, in some cases, in some cities, the Swedes are offering returning ISIS fighters jobs, homes, welfare payments.
[03:44:15.745 --> 03:44:17.366]  Yeah, that's not fake news.
[03:44:17.366 --> 03:44:19.488]  That's been reported over and over again.
[03:44:19.488 --> 03:44:26.634]  They're actually offering Islamic State fighters welfare.
[03:44:26.634 --> 03:44:28.195]  Should we turn them away at the border?
[03:44:28.195 --> 03:44:29.236]  They've beheaded people.
[03:44:29.236 --> 03:44:30.357]  Should we just let them back in?
[03:44:30.357 --> 03:44:31.058]  Yeah, just let them in.
[03:44:31.058 --> 03:44:31.598]  We're tolerant.
[03:44:31.598 --> 03:44:32.199]  We're progressive.
[03:44:33.672 --> 03:44:36.074]  Now they set up a hotline.
[03:44:36.074 --> 03:44:43.500]  They didn't say, let's turn them away, let's not let these bloodthirsty jihadist killers back into our supposedly liberal country.
[03:44:43.500 --> 03:44:46.463]  No, that wasn't even up for consideration.
[03:44:46.463 --> 03:44:48.405]  They just let them back in.
[03:44:48.405 --> 03:44:54.129]  But they set up a terrorist hotline so people who saw something suspicious could call in.
[03:44:54.890 --> 03:44:59.992]  And report one of these ISIS terrorists which the government had let back into the country.
[03:44:59.992 --> 03:45:06.796]  Then they shut down the terrorist hotline because they thought it might be encouraging racism.
[03:45:06.796 --> 03:45:09.917]  That's what's happening in Sweden today.
[03:45:09.917 --> 03:45:11.138]  Absolutely insane.
[03:45:11.138 --> 03:45:17.521]  Meanwhile their government is reopening Cold War bunkers over fears of Russian invasion.
[03:45:18.576 --> 03:45:27.266]  Shelters on the Baltic island of Gotland will be prioritised for comprehensive checks after it was identified as a likely target for Russian invasion last year.
[03:45:27.266 --> 03:45:34.634]  Sweden's most populous island has been the site of a dramatic build-up of military training more than a decade after being demilitarised.
[03:45:35.600 --> 03:45:41.541]  So they're reopening hundreds of Cold War bunkers on this island.
[03:45:41.541 --> 03:45:46.502]  This is the target, supposedly, they claim, of Russian invasion plans.
[03:45:46.502 --> 03:45:55.284]  They spent $9 billion during the Cold War to build nuclear bunkers, so they've got enough to shelter 80% of the population.
[03:45:55.284 --> 03:45:59.665]  But they've got a problem, because they're letting in so many foreign immigrants
[03:46:00.966 --> 03:46:06.492]  More and more people are not going to be protected in the very worst case scenario.
[03:46:06.492 --> 03:46:10.697]  So now they're having to go through all these checks, reopen these bunkers.
[03:46:10.697 --> 03:46:14.541]  The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency says that
[03:46:15.222 --> 03:46:18.543]  The country's municipalities need to prepare for war.
[03:46:18.543 --> 03:46:23.924]  They've brought back compulsory military service for young people.
[03:46:23.924 --> 03:46:25.604]  They're short of soldiers.
[03:46:25.604 --> 03:46:26.804]  They're basically freaking out.
[03:46:26.804 --> 03:46:32.726]  But they're not freaking out about the fact that they're just letting ISIS jihadists back into the country.
[03:46:32.726 --> 03:46:37.187]  The fact that areas of Stockholm and Malmo are on fire every night.
[03:46:37.187 --> 03:46:38.987]  They have riots all the time.
[03:46:38.987 --> 03:46:40.627]  Murders are going through the roof.
[03:46:40.627 --> 03:46:43.528]  They've got the highest rape rate in Europe.
[03:46:43.528 --> 03:46:43.648]  No.
[03:46:44.048 --> 03:46:45.929]  That's not what they're concerned about.
[03:46:45.929 --> 03:46:50.330]  They're concerned about Russia invading them.
[03:46:50.330 --> 03:46:52.551]  That's what's going on in Sweden.
[03:46:52.551 --> 03:46:58.792]  While the mainstream media still pretends that it's all hunky-dory, it's a liberal paradise.
[03:46:58.792 --> 03:47:03.514]  Meanwhile in Holland, where they just had the election, this is out of westmonster.com.
[03:47:05.612 --> 03:47:09.293]  Dutch Education Ministry teach migrant kids in foreign language.
[03:47:09.293 --> 03:47:12.355]  So they've just given up on the integration altogether now.
[03:47:12.355 --> 03:47:27.683]  In an example of staggering stupidity, the Dutch Education Ministry has recommended to primary schools that they teach the children of asylum seekers and migrants using the language of where they came, rather than just teaching them Dutch.
[03:47:27.683 --> 03:47:32.626]  So they've basically given up on integrating them and say, yeah, we'll just teach them in Arabic.
[03:47:33.524 --> 03:47:36.388]  We'll just turn over our entire society.
[03:47:36.388 --> 03:47:45.159]  In Sweden, they're now creating glossaries for new workers on construction sites where every single term is translated into Arabic again.
[03:47:46.212 --> 03:47:55.818]  The onus should be on them to learn Swedish and Dutch, not on the entire society of Holland and Sweden to change, to become Arabic.
[03:47:55.818 --> 03:48:07.265]  But that's what happens when you just allow people in, they congregate into ghettos, they radicalise, they create more terrorism, they create more sexual assaults, they're responsible for more crime.
[03:48:07.265 --> 03:48:09.427]  That's what's happening in Europe.
[03:48:09.907 --> 03:48:17.233]  And now in Holland, they've just given up altogether on integrating people by trying to teach them Dutch.
[03:48:17.233 --> 03:48:20.836]  Now they're just going to teach them in Arabic.
[03:48:20.836 --> 03:48:22.137]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[03:48:22.137 --> 03:48:25.399]  Globalist will force EU to accept more Muslim migrants.
[03:48:25.399 --> 03:48:34.827]  The European Union's Immigration Commissioner says the bloc has the tools, the means and the power to force EU member states to accept Muslim migrants.
[03:48:35.472 --> 03:48:42.755]  Dimitris Avramopoulos, Greece's Commissioner for the EU's Common Immigration and Asylum Policy, made the comments during a Visit to Poland.
[03:48:42.755 --> 03:48:50.459]  So they're basically threatening European countries with economic penalties if they don't accept more migrants.
[03:48:50.459 --> 03:48:54.441]  Even as Erdogan in Turkey, over and over again,
[03:48:54.921 --> 03:49:13.500]  ...threatens to use the migrant wave as a weapon against European countries if they don't give him more money, if they don't allow him to campaign politically in Europe, as we saw a couple of weeks ago with the Islamists rioting on the streets of Rotterdam and Amsterdam chanting Al-Akbar.
[03:49:14.548 --> 03:49:15.949]  But again, that's key.
[03:49:15.949 --> 03:49:19.531]  Note how Erdogan characterizes the migrants.
[03:49:19.531 --> 03:49:26.895]  Not as desperate, suffering refugees, but as a weapon to be used against the West.
[03:49:26.895 --> 03:49:28.937]  And he's done that over and over again.
[03:49:28.937 --> 03:49:31.718]  And you've got to put your hands up to him.
[03:49:31.718 --> 03:49:33.920]  I mean, at least he's being honest, right?
[03:49:33.920 --> 03:49:37.262]  Given what we've seen happening in Europe.
[03:49:37.262 --> 03:49:40.604]  So that's what we've got happening in Holland, in the Netherlands.
[03:49:40.604 --> 03:49:42.185]  Now we have top globalists saying,
[03:49:43.479 --> 03:49:48.745]  You better start accepting more or we're going to hit you with more financial penalties.
[03:49:49.634 --> 03:49:54.698]  Big Bang Theory star confronts leftists for ignoring Islam's abuse of women.
[03:49:54.698 --> 03:49:57.160]  This is like seeing a unicorn.
[03:49:57.160 --> 03:50:04.966]  An actor, an actual actor, has spoken out on left-wing hypocrisy when it comes to Islam.
[03:50:04.966 --> 03:50:15.934]  This is the Big Bang Theory star Mayim Bialik, who is making headlines for calling out Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian activist and Sharia law proponent, over her comments on feminism.
[03:50:16.906 --> 03:50:18.227]  And you can go and read the quotes there.
[03:50:18.227 --> 03:50:24.472]  So an actual actor in Hollywood is calling out leftist hypocrisy on Islam.
[03:50:24.472 --> 03:50:27.275]  Absolute bombshell story.
[03:50:27.275 --> 03:50:28.576]  You won't see that again for a while.
[03:50:30.494 --> 03:50:32.976]  1500 acid attacks have been recorded in London since 2011.
[03:50:32.976 --> 03:50:36.399]  We're going to get more into that after the break.
[03:50:36.399 --> 03:50:44.866]  Wait until you find out what the top areas are in London that have experienced this skyrocketing spate of acid attacks.
[03:50:44.866 --> 03:50:48.389]  It won't really surprise you one bit.
[03:50:48.389 --> 03:50:51.111]  We'll be back with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:51.111 --> 03:50:51.672]  Don't go away.
[03:50:59.059 --> 03:51:00.699]  This is Elizabeth McCabe, a.k.a.
[03:51:00.699 --> 03:51:02.540]  Lucky One, of Truth Frequency News.
[03:51:02.540 --> 03:51:05.560]  I wanted to tell you all about Extend-A-Vite from HeartDrop.com.
[03:51:05.560 --> 03:51:07.841]  Y'all know I check everything before I air it.
[03:51:07.841 --> 03:51:12.261]  When I heard about Extend-A-Vite on TFR, I went to HeartDrop.com and started my research.
[03:51:12.261 --> 03:51:13.482]  It's got cayenne.
[03:51:13.482 --> 03:51:14.862]  That's good for blood and circulation.
[03:51:14.862 --> 03:51:16.302]  It stimulates the blood flow.
[03:51:16.302 --> 03:51:21.363]  It's got garlic, which fights bacteria like antibiotics, and it lowers the cholesterol and blood pressure.
[03:51:21.363 --> 03:51:24.363]  It also has milk thistle, which is the best detox for liver.
[03:51:24.363 --> 03:51:26.984]  I couldn't wait to try it out, and I'm glad I did four months ago.
[03:51:27.264 --> 03:51:28.804]  And here's Alfie's results.

[03:54:25.950 --> 03:54:29.873]  It is the Myco ZX Fungus and Yeast Cleanser.

[03:55:38.126 --> 03:55:40.268]  Few final stories here.
[03:55:40.268 --> 03:55:44.491]  BBC reports historical dramas limit UK black actors.
[03:55:44.491 --> 03:55:51.276]  This again is another one of those things where they have to filter everything through the lens of social justice.
[03:55:51.276 --> 03:55:59.962]  Actress Sandy Newton has said she can't work in the UK because there are no roles for black and minority ethnic actors in historical dramas.
[03:55:59.962 --> 03:56:05.346]  London-born Newton said the number of costume dramas had led to slim pickings for people of colour
[03:56:05.866 --> 03:56:15.610]  The criticism comes after the British Film Institute research found that 59% of UK films since 2006 had no black actors in any role.
[03:56:15.610 --> 03:56:30.257]  Well, the problem with not including black actors in historical dramas is if you did include black actors in historical dramas set in England 200 years ago, they would cease to be historical.
[03:56:31.417 --> 03:56:32.778]  That's the frigging point.
[03:56:32.778 --> 03:56:42.604]  If you want it to be historically accurate, you have to accurately represent the people who were living in England, for example, in the 1800s.
[03:56:42.604 --> 03:56:46.766]  Very few black people were living in England in the 1800s.
[03:56:46.766 --> 03:56:50.689]  So obviously, there aren't going to be a large number of roles for black actors.
[03:56:51.394 --> 03:57:00.820]  It's like if you were doing a production about Nigeria in the 1920s, and you were complaining about there not being enough white people in the production.
[03:57:00.820 --> 03:57:02.942]  Well, of course there's not going to be white people in it.
[03:57:02.942 --> 03:57:04.503]  It's in Nigeria.
[03:57:04.503 --> 03:57:08.926]  Even if it was set in Nigeria now, there'd be no white people in it.
[03:57:08.926 --> 03:57:10.106]  That's the reason.
[03:57:10.106 --> 03:57:19.913]  It's got nothing to do with racism, but again, everything in the arts, everything in theatre, everything in cinema has to be filtered through this lens of social justice.
[03:57:21.397 --> 03:57:22.898]  They're making everything crappy.
[03:57:22.898 --> 03:57:29.683]  In fact, I've got another video coming out on modern art, which will probably be out tomorrow, which covers that very issue.
[03:57:29.683 --> 03:57:32.145]  A couple of stories left.
[03:57:32.145 --> 03:57:39.031]  CBS San Francisco reports tattoo removal business booming as fears of deportation mount.
[03:57:39.031 --> 03:57:44.355]  An East Bay Tattoo Removal Clinic says they've treated a record number of clients since the election.
[03:57:44.355 --> 03:57:50.780]  Some in the Latino community worry ICE agents will use their tattoos as an excuse to stop them and check immigration status.
[03:57:51.934 --> 03:57:56.360]  So of course we know that many of these illegal immigrants have gang tattoos.
[03:57:56.360 --> 03:58:00.585]  Now they're getting them all removed because they think ICE is gonna stop them.
[03:58:00.585 --> 03:58:03.770]  Use that as an excuse to basically deport them.
[03:58:04.801 --> 03:58:10.085]  That is a reflection of what's happening as Donald Trump continues to build the wall.

[03:58:20.993 --> 03:58:26.077]  We're being accused of something that Twitter, Facebook and Google have done on a regular basis.
[03:58:26.497 --> 03:58:29.019]  They're the ones manipulating public opinion.
[03:58:29.019 --> 03:58:33.382]  This is a ruse to censor InfoWars, so we really need your support.
[03:58:33.382 --> 03:58:34.202]  That's going to wrap it up.
[03:58:34.202 --> 03:58:36.264]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
