[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.481]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.502]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:22.442]  I'm Darren McBrain.
[00:00:22.582 --> 00:00:24.264]  It's Friday, March 3rd, 2017.
[00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:27.506]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:34.430]  Tonight, fake news propagating fake news.
[00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.693]  Mainstream news outlets are actually creating fake platforms and fake content.
[00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:41.835]  It sounds crazy, but it's true.
[00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:49.166]  Also, The Intercept runs an untimely hit piece on Donald Trump that ends up backfiring royally.
[00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:52.628]  Meanwhile, President Trump gave his weekly address today.
[00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:57.032]  We replay it and review it, highlighting Trump's message directly to the people.
[00:00:57.272 --> 00:01:00.775]  Investing in the military means investing in peace.
[00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:06.079]  Because the best way to prevent war, as George Washington said,
[00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:08.700]  Is to be prepared for it.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:18.644]  And then, the Obama deep state and the Democrats are colluding in every which way in an arrogant attempt to take out Trump and demean the American electorate.
[00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:22.306]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:36.952]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:44.718]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.
[00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:55.747]  InfoWars Prime, where you can watch live high-definition feeds of the Alex Jones Show, plus exclusive insider videos from the InfoWars crew and behind-the-scenes
[00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:56.387]  Action!
[00:01:56.427 --> 00:02:00.388]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app and download today.
[00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:04.870]  InfoWars Prime is available right now for your iPhone or Android.
[00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.511]  You will have access to exclusive videos that you can't see anywhere else.
[00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:15.173]  That means live coverage of events and breaking news on location as it happens.
[00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:22.343]  You can also take advantage of amazing deals from the InfoWars store that are only available for InfoWars Prime subscribers.
[00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:26.589]  That's InfoWars Prime at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:11.481]  You know, there's been a lot of talk lately about fake news versus real news, and how you, the viewer, can spot the difference.
[00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:23.044]  I know it's not always easy, and hell, we've been accused here at InfoWars from time to time spreading fake news, usually by the establishment media who would prefer that you watch them instead.
[00:03:23.624 --> 00:03:30.751]  But I was thinking we could give you some guidelines this evening on how to tell the difference between real and fake news.
[00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:38.137]  And it's probably a good idea that you share this information with your family and friends so they too can filter out the bullshit.
[00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:39.879]  Now, let's get started, shall we?
[00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:46.806]  The first thing you want to do when you're looking for fake news, numeral uno, consider the source.
[00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:53.871]  If you're on social media and you're about to click on that share button, be sure to check out the website.
[00:03:54.372 --> 00:03:57.014]  Look at the URL and the domain name first.
[00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:02.939]  For example, you might think you are reading an article, let's say, from the BBC.
[00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:08.923]  But in reality, you are reading an article from an imposter website.
[00:04:09.284 --> 00:04:11.726]  Someone who imitates the BBC.
[00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:16.570]  All you have to do to tell the difference is simply look at the URL address.
[00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.672]  If it says bbc.com, well, it's legit.
[00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:31.580]  But if it says something like bbc.com.co, well, it's probably a bogus website with false information.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.545]  You see, a lot of these phony websites, they look like traditional establishment mainstream media websites, but they're not.
[00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:46.590]  They're total frauds, and there's a lot of them out there, too, who are pretending to be someone they are not.
[00:04:47.358 --> 00:04:53.099]  Like these guys, who want you to believe they are the official ABC News website.
[00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.920]  I mean, it says it right there on their homepage, ABC News.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.141]  Sure looks and feels like the real thing, but guess what?
[00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:01.001]  It's not.
[00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:03.142]  They are imposters.
[00:05:03.542 --> 00:05:08.843]  Again, check out the URL, abcnews.com.co.
[00:05:09.423 --> 00:05:13.684]  They are mimicking ABC, but it's not the real thing.
[00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:14.744]  And you know what?
[00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:16.165]  It happens to us too.
[00:05:16.386 --> 00:05:27.313]  I mean, there's a lot of fake Alex Jones and Infowars Facebook pages out there and websites who try to imitate us or make us look crazy.
[00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:34.137]  But you can always tell if it's someone's official Facebook page by that blue checkmark right there.
[00:05:34.378 --> 00:05:34.898]  You see that?
[00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:37.099]  That means it's official.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.800]  And it's the same for YouTube.
[00:05:39.081 --> 00:05:43.904]  They will have a checkmark so you'll know it's an official YouTube channel.
[00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:55.658]  Now, I want to let you in on a little secret, and this might come as a shock to some of you, but guess where a lot of these phony, fake websites come from to begin with?
[00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:56.419]  Are you ready?
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.567]  They come from the establishment Mainstream News Media, and I'm going to prove it to you right now.
[00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:22.202]  Recently, 20th Century Fox got busted creating fake news websites, complete with made-up stories that were spread online and shared by millions of people on Facebook who had no idea they were reading and spreading fake news.
[00:06:22.762 --> 00:06:31.629]  An article by the New York Times reveals that 20th Century Fox created fake news websites that looked like the real deal.
[00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:43.898]  They created names like the Houston Leader and the Salt Lake City Guardian and populated them with bogus headlines and fictitious stories about everything from Lady Gaga
[00:06:47.421 --> 00:07:01.693]  Here's one that says Trump orders the CDC to remove all vaccination-related information from the White House website by the Salt Lake City Guardian, a news organization that doesn't even exist.
[00:07:02.133 --> 00:07:05.897]  It's a fabricated lie brought to you by 20th Century Fox.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.521]  But wait, there's more!
[00:07:10.781 --> 00:07:16.206]  These are all fake news websites produced by the mainstream news media.
[00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:24.634]  Websites like Salt Lake City Guardian, The Houston Leader, Sacramento Dispatch, New York Morning Post, and the Indianapolis Gazette.
[00:07:25.214 --> 00:07:26.875]  And check out some of these headlines.
[00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:28.196]  Bombshell!
[00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:35.920]  Trump and Putin spotted at Swiss Resort prior to election from the Sacramento Dispatch.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.062]  Again, a news organization that does not exist.
[00:07:40.362 --> 00:07:41.063]  Here's another one.
[00:07:41.463 --> 00:07:50.868]  Trump refuses to provide California federal support in midst of natural dot dot dot clickbait to fake news.
[00:07:51.408 --> 00:07:57.849]  Now another guideline you can use to tell the difference between real and fake news is check out the news sources.
[00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.891]  Do they provide links to trustworthy news outlets who collaborate the information?
[00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:08.652]  A news article with multiple sources, that is a good thing.
[00:08:08.972 --> 00:08:17.594]  And I always like to look and see if they have a comment section because if they don't provide comments, that usually means they are hiding something.
[00:08:18.214 --> 00:08:25.678]  And if you'll notice, traditional mainstream news websites, most of them do not include a comment section anymore.
[00:08:25.978 --> 00:08:32.682]  And that's because informed and knowledgeable citizens are able to call out their BS and debunk their propaganda.
[00:08:33.643 --> 00:08:35.403]  And they do it right there in the comment section.
[00:08:35.744 --> 00:08:38.545]  So the MSM had to put a stop to that.
[00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:49.672]  You hardly see any comment sections anymore on traditional mainstream news media websites because they are the ones who are spreading fake news.
[00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:56.197]  So there's some basic guidelines to filter out the BS when you come across a news story.
[00:08:56.237 --> 00:09:03.562]  And if you really want to dig deep down the rabbit hole, I suggest you look into the father of propaganda, Edward Bernays.
[00:09:03.902 --> 00:09:07.584]  Check out Aldous Huxley and Operation Mockingbird.
[00:09:07.764 --> 00:09:09.926]  You'll see just how deep the rabbit hole
[00:09:11.187 --> 00:09:25.254]  And if you want to see someone who's always been pretty good at sniffing out and calling out the mainstream media's BS, well you have to look no further than the anti-establishment President of the United States.
[00:09:26.952 --> 00:09:32.394]  You know, I've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news, and they're talking about people that go and say all sorts of things.
[00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:37.716]  But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news, more so than anybody.
[00:09:38.157 --> 00:09:39.557]  I could name them, but I won't bother.
[00:09:39.617 --> 00:09:41.978]  But you have a few sitting right in front of us.
[00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.979]  So they're very, very dishonest people.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.661]  But I think it's just something we're going to have to live with.
[00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.722]  I guess the advantage I have is that
[00:09:51.602 --> 00:09:52.343]  I can speak back.
[00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:58.372]  When it happens to somebody that doesn't have this, doesn't have that kind of a megaphone...
[00:09:59.378 --> 00:10:00.238]  They can't speak back.
[00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:01.158]  It's a very sad thing.
[00:10:01.198 --> 00:10:02.399]  I've seen people destroyed.
[00:10:02.859 --> 00:10:05.699]  I've seen people absolutely destroyed.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.440]  And I think it's very unfair.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.400]  So all I can ask for is honest reporters.
[00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:16.262]  Information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.
[00:10:16.722 --> 00:10:25.144]  As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences.
[00:10:25.184 --> 00:10:25.844]  They already are.
[00:10:26.164 --> 00:10:28.284]  Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[00:10:28.505 --> 00:10:28.785]  Go ahead.
[00:10:28.805 --> 00:10:29.345]  Go ahead.
[00:10:29.405 --> 00:10:29.905]  No, not you.
[00:10:29.925 --> 00:10:30.145]  Not you.
[00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:31.885]  Your organization is terrible.
[00:10:31.905 --> 00:10:33.105]  Your organization is terrible.
[00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:33.666]  Let's go.
[00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:33.986]  Go ahead.
[00:10:34.026 --> 00:10:34.166]  Quiet.
[00:10:34.186 --> 00:10:34.426]  Quiet.
[00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:34.626]  Go ahead.
[00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:36.066]  She's asking a question.
[00:10:36.086 --> 00:10:36.526]  Don't be rude.
[00:10:36.546 --> 00:10:36.946]  Don't be rude.
[00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:38.027]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:10:38.127 --> 00:10:39.187]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:10:39.227 --> 00:10:39.767]  You are fake news.
[00:10:56.284 --> 00:10:57.645]  Go ahead.
[00:10:57.745 --> 00:10:59.426]  Should I let him have a little bit more?
[00:10:59.446 --> 00:11:00.566]  What do you think, Peter?
[00:11:00.887 --> 00:11:02.808]  Peter, should I let him have a little bit more?
[00:11:02.988 --> 00:11:03.468]  Sit down.
[00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:04.108]  Sit down.
[00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:05.349]  We'll get it.
[00:11:05.369 --> 00:11:11.792]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir... I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[00:11:11.853 --> 00:11:13.553]  Doesn't that undermine... Very fake news.
[00:11:13.613 --> 00:11:14.394]  I know, but aren't you...
[00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:22.692]  I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.
[00:11:22.952 --> 00:11:23.452]  It's fake.
[00:11:23.792 --> 00:11:27.635]  A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
[00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:28.396]  And they are.
[00:11:28.736 --> 00:11:30.217]  They are the enemy of the people.
[00:11:31.218 --> 00:11:33.019]  Because they have no sources.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.201]  They just make them up.
[00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:36.882]  When there are none.
[00:11:37.202 --> 00:11:41.385]  You know, the dishonest media, they'll say, he didn't get a standing ovation.
[00:11:41.405 --> 00:11:41.905]  You know why?
[00:11:41.925 --> 00:11:43.547]  No, you know why?
[00:11:44.507 --> 00:11:46.809]  Because everybody stood and nobody sat.
[00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:49.431]  So they will say, he never got a standing ovation.
[00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:49.551]  Right?
[00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:51.713]  That's the way they are.
[00:11:54.775 --> 00:11:55.536]  They are the worst.
[00:12:08.513 --> 00:12:11.774]  Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.
[00:12:13.034 --> 00:12:14.114]  They leave out the part.
[00:12:14.694 --> 00:12:15.954]  They never sat down.
[00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:16.735]  They leave that out.
[00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:19.235]  They're very dishonest people.
[00:12:19.275 --> 00:12:28.577]  In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
[00:12:28.637 --> 00:12:29.597]  The fake news.
[00:12:30.377 --> 00:12:33.538]  They dropped off the word fake.
[00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.919]  And all of a sudden, the story became the media
[00:12:39.306 --> 00:12:39.826]  Is the enemy.
[00:12:39.866 --> 00:12:41.427]  They take the word fake out.
[00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:45.590]  And now I'm saying, oh, no, this is no good.
[00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.571]  But that's the way they are.
[00:12:48.792 --> 00:12:50.413]  So I'm not against the media.
[00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:52.114]  I'm not against the press.
[00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:57.418]  I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them.
[00:12:57.438 --> 00:12:59.339]  And I love good stories, but we won't.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.281]  I don't get too many.
[00:13:04.062 --> 00:13:04.762]  But I am.
[00:13:05.982 --> 00:13:09.344]  Only against the fake news media or press.
[00:13:09.504 --> 00:13:09.765]  Fake.
[00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:10.485]  Fake.
[00:13:10.545 --> 00:13:14.908]  You have to leave that word.
[00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.252]  On February 25th at 3.53 p.m.
[00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:29.417]  President Donald Trump posted on Twitter, I will not be attending the White House Correspondents Association dinner this year.
[00:13:29.857 --> 00:13:33.019]  Please wish everyone well and have a great evening.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.021]  They are the enemy of the people.
[00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:42.015]  President Trump's latest shot in his ongoing war with the mainstream media, skipping a light-hearted Washington D.C.
[00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.056]  tradition this April.
[00:13:43.496 --> 00:13:51.581]  The significance of this post is that this is the first time a president will miss the dinner since Ronald Reagan in 1981.
[00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:56.844]  So does Trump's vacancy mean the end of a great American tradition?
[00:13:57.145 --> 00:14:00.407]  Or is this the end of a great American hoax?
[00:14:01.047 --> 00:14:17.292]  Well, as you might already know, the White House Correspondents Association Dinner is an evening that is televised for the whole nation to see, where politicians and Washington insiders mingle with reporters and Hollywood celebrities.
[00:14:18.172 --> 00:14:18.773]  Good evening.
[00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:25.635]  Thank you, Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, distinguished members of the press, and Bon Jovi.
[00:14:27.458 --> 00:14:36.141]  So where does this tradition of combining politicians, actors, and reporters in one televised room, where does the tradition come from anyway?
[00:14:36.381 --> 00:14:41.683]  Well, as you might imagine, this did not occur naturally, and it didn't happen by chance.
[00:14:42.203 --> 00:14:45.724]  If you read up on the history of the White House Correspondents Dinner,
[00:14:46.064 --> 00:14:53.831]  You'll learn how reporters used to line up outside the White House waiting for an opportunity to meet the President.
[00:14:54.111 --> 00:15:02.158]  Teddy Roosevelt, taking pity on the reporters standing out in the cold, invited the press inside for a few questions.
[00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:05.781]  Thus, the beginning of the White House Press Corps.
[00:15:08.092 --> 00:15:10.253]  So where did the Hollywood celebrities come from?
[00:15:10.514 --> 00:15:13.515]  And why are they invited to the White House Correspondents' Dinner?
[00:15:13.675 --> 00:15:21.740]  Well, as it turns out, the event was the brainchild of the father of propaganda, Edward Bernays.
[00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:30.906]  The man who coined the term public relations, wrote the book Propaganda, and was the nephew of legendary psychologist
[00:15:31.346 --> 00:15:32.486]  Sigmund Freud.
[00:15:32.706 --> 00:15:43.549]  Bernays redefined consumerism when he applied his uncle's discovery and understanding of the unconscious mind to conventional advertising techniques.
[00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:53.631]  No longer would an advertisement talk to the needs of an individual buyer, but rather it began to speak to unconscious, instinctual behaviors.
[00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:57.573]  Which is expressed throughout entire populations.
[00:15:58.073 --> 00:16:01.274]  What Bernays called herd mentality.
[00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:08.638]  In other words, methods that introduced social engineering on a massive scale.
[00:16:09.238 --> 00:16:23.826]  The Bernays' advertising techniques won him some of the most prestigious clients in America that included Lucky Strike cigarettes, Procter & Gamble, Dixie Cups, and the 1939 World's Fair, plus many others.
[00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:29.890]  And it wasn't long before his propaganda techniques attracted the attention of the White House.
[00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.613]  President Calvin Coolidge's staff felt his public image needed a positive boost.
[00:16:36.053 --> 00:16:46.500]  So they called Edward Bernays and it was his idea to showcase the president having dinner with famous movie stars to improve his public image.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:59.849]  In this clip from the 2002 BBC miniseries Century of the Self, Bernays describes his idea to set up the president for a photo op with the popular movie stars of the day.
[00:17:00.229 --> 00:17:01.190]  Had my mind up.
[00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:06.874]  These 34 people, and I'd say, what's your name?
[00:17:07.975 --> 00:17:09.356]  He'd say, Al Jolson.
[00:17:09.977 --> 00:17:12.399]  I'd say, Mr. President, Al Jolson.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:27.692]  The next day, every newspaper in the United States had a front page story, President Coolidge entertains actors at White House.
[00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:31.708]  Naturally this made headlines all across the country.
[00:17:31.928 --> 00:17:39.632]  The President of the United States hanging out with some of the most exciting and sought-after in crowds in the country.
[00:17:39.832 --> 00:17:53.777]  Now flash forward to 2017 and this time the President of the United States does not want a photo op with the Hollywood elite and he will not attend the White House Correspondents Association dinner.
[00:17:54.037 --> 00:17:57.899]  In the words of White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders,
[00:17:58.379 --> 00:18:04.821]  President Trump wasn't elected to spend his time with reporters and celebrities.
[00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:09.642]  This wasn't a president who was elected to spend his time with reporters and celebrities.
[00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:16.524]  This was a president who campaigned on speaking directly to Americans and that's exactly what he's going to spend his time doing.
[00:18:16.704 --> 00:18:25.027]  That's right, and if you want to learn more, I highly recommend that you Google and YouTube search Edward Bernays, the father of propaganda.
[00:18:25.487 --> 00:18:30.809]  I'm Darren McBreen, and you can see more reports like this one right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:01.169 --> 00:19:03.391]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.711 --> 00:19:15.722]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:19:15.742 --> 00:19:23.309]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.

[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:53.536]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.837 --> 00:23:00.769]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:01.644 --> 00:23:14.728]  At the end of World War II, Operation Paperclip was launched by the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS, to smuggle known Nazi war criminals into the United States for recruitment into U.S.
[00:23:14.848 --> 00:23:16.109]  intelligence agencies.
[00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:22.431]  The Nazis were cleared to work in America after having their backgrounds bleached by the military.
[00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:29.335]  False employment histories were provided and their previous Nazi affiliations were completely removed from the record.
[00:23:29.555 --> 00:23:35.759]  The OSS provided a model for the Central Intelligence Agency that was established in September 1947.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:43.264]  The CIA specialized in propaganda, economic warfare, sabotage and demolition.
[00:23:43.564 --> 00:23:53.211]  By the early 1950s, they controlled over 25 newspapers and wire agencies, and had 3,000 plus employees engaged in propaganda.
[00:23:53.432 --> 00:24:03.019]  Journalists willing to promote the views of the CIA included members of the New York Times, Time Magazine, Newsweek, The Washington Post, and CBS Television.
[00:24:03.199 --> 00:24:09.123]  Do you have any people paid by the CIA?
[00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:14.198]  Who are working for television networks.
[00:24:14.598 --> 00:24:21.049]  This, I think, gets into the kind of getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I'd like to get into an executive session.
[00:24:21.349 --> 00:24:23.933]  At CBS, we
[00:24:25.054 --> 00:24:32.221]  I had been contacted by the CIA, as a matter of fact, by the time I became the head of the whole News and Public Affairs operation in 1954.
[00:24:32.702 --> 00:24:36.546]  Ships had been established and I was told about them and asked if I'd carry on with them.
[00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:40.290]  We're really talking about intelligence at the highest levels of the U.S.
[00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.073]  government, setting the broad direction for the nation.
[00:24:43.601 --> 00:24:46.722]  John Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com joins us now.
[00:24:46.822 --> 00:24:57.806]  And John, before you joined us, we just played a clip about Operation Mockingbird and how the CIA was heavily embedded in the mainstream media all the way back in the early 1950s.
[00:24:58.126 --> 00:25:02.268]  And you and I both know the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:25:02.388 --> 00:25:11.091]  And if anything, there's probably much more intelligence operations going on now in the mainstream media than ever before.
[00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:12.732]  It's the great American
[00:25:13.132 --> 00:25:27.162]  PSYOP, we know that six corporations control 90% of everything we watch, listen to, or read in newspapers, and now we're finding out that the Washington Post and Amazon is in bed with the CIA.
[00:25:27.182 --> 00:25:28.463]  You want to tell us a little more about that?
[00:25:29.183 --> 00:25:29.443]  Sure.
[00:25:30.624 --> 00:25:31.885]  This is a major story.
[00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:35.768]  Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon,
[00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.792]  Uh, went to the Washington Post back in 2013.
[00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:43.354]  They were on the verge of financial collapse.
[00:25:44.534 --> 00:25:46.976]  So he said, well, I'm going to put some cash on the table.
[00:25:48.037 --> 00:25:50.218]  How does $250 million sound?
[00:25:50.278 --> 00:25:52.399]  And they said, sold, sold.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.801]  And he bought the Washington Post.
[00:25:56.562 --> 00:26:01.445]  But the thing is, he also has a contract through Amazon with the CIA.
[00:26:02.944 --> 00:26:09.566]  A $600 million contract to provide cloud computing services to the CIA.
[00:26:10.746 --> 00:26:15.447]  And the chances are that that contract is going to be renewed and increased.
[00:26:16.287 --> 00:26:16.367]  Wow.
[00:26:17.027 --> 00:26:23.569]  So that means that we're now talking about an incredible conflict of interest every time the Washington Post
[00:26:24.733 --> 00:26:35.119]  Writes a story about the CIA, quotes somebody from the CIA, relies on a CIA source anonymously for a tip or a lead or information.
[00:26:35.319 --> 00:26:36.300]  There should be a disclaimer.
[00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:37.841]  Absolutely.
[00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:45.546]  In front of every article, it should say, our owner, Jeff Bezos, has a $600 million contract with the CIA.
[00:26:46.066 --> 00:26:52.610]  So take everything that we're saying about the CIA with a huge Mount Everest-sized grain of salt.
[00:26:53.464 --> 00:27:02.948]  I think it's interesting that nobody else, it's typical I guess too, that nobody else in the mainstream is reporting on this either because the only, I've learned it from you.
[00:27:04.009 --> 00:27:05.269]  Nobody else is reporting on this.
[00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.571]  You would think this is a big story for the mainstream.
[00:27:09.591 --> 00:27:10.292]  Yeah, you would think.
[00:27:10.932 --> 00:27:11.552]  But it isn't.
[00:27:12.372 --> 00:27:12.713]  It isn't.
[00:27:12.773 --> 00:27:20.156]  It's the kind of story you could pound on for days and weeks and months to find out more about this contract, to find out
[00:27:21.621 --> 00:27:23.443]  Well, which came first?
[00:27:24.423 --> 00:27:27.706]  The purchase of the Washington Post or the contract with the CIA?
[00:27:27.986 --> 00:27:41.057]  And in either case, you could certainly make a circumstantial case for Jeff Bezos saying, look, to himself, good contract, fabulous contract with the CIA.
[00:27:41.157 --> 00:27:46.061]  Now I'll buy a newspaper that has a long history of being connected to the CIA.
[00:27:47.355 --> 00:28:10.205]  And that's going to cement my position with the CIA even tighter so that I can get more good deals and contracts from the CIA and we'll just use the Washington Post as a kind of dupe in all of this by spreading whatever disinformation the CIA wants us to spread without any conflict of interest statement whatsoever.
[00:28:10.665 --> 00:28:15.748]  So you would think the New York Times would pick on this, pick up on this, every television network would?
[00:28:16.496 --> 00:28:28.227]  Well, they're watching each other's backs, and I think that we're witnessing a direct result of this unholy alliance between Amazon and the Washington Post and the CIA.
[00:28:28.888 --> 00:28:31.750]  And a good example would be WikiLeaks.
[00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:39.598]  During the run-up to the election, all these WikiLeaks scandals were coming out about the Hillary Clinton campaign, and Amazon blocked it!
[00:28:39.758 --> 00:28:48.705]  They wouldn't allow anybody to go to the WikiLeaks websites or any bad news coverage that had to do with the Hillary Clinton scandals and WikiLeaks, am I right?
[00:28:49.225 --> 00:28:49.745]  There you go.
[00:28:50.266 --> 00:28:51.907]  There's a perfect example of that.
[00:28:52.407 --> 00:28:57.291]  Of slanting the news, censoring the news, omitting the news, which in itself
[00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.410]  is a version of fake news.
[00:29:00.111 --> 00:29:01.351]  So yeah, you've got that.
[00:29:01.811 --> 00:29:14.214]  And you've also got the fact that the Washington Post took the lead right after the election debacle for the Democrats and said, you know what, there's a whole lot of fake news sites out there.
[00:29:14.894 --> 00:29:17.275]  They were the ones that really launched that story.
[00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:22.991]  And they gave all manner of really ridiculous sources on the story.
[00:29:23.812 --> 00:29:30.299]  And so they began that campaign, which then echo chambered through all the major media and is still echo chambering.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:38.427]  And so we're looking at, you know, this collusion among major media, CIA, etc, etc.
[00:29:39.534 --> 00:29:47.779]  Yeah, like I said, this is modern day and it just reminds me of the beginning of the good old days of the CIA back in the late 40s, early 1950s.
[00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:54.883]  And now we're finding out that the mainstream media is the one behind a lot of these fake news websites that came out.
[00:29:54.923 --> 00:30:02.547]  They were 20th Century Fox in an attempt to promote, that was their excuse anyway, to promote one of their movies.
[00:30:02.868 --> 00:30:06.710]  They launched several fake news websites with names
[00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:14.698]  Like the Salt Lake City Guardian, the Houston Leader, Sacramento Dispatch, New York Morning Post, and Indianapolis Gazette.
[00:30:15.218 --> 00:30:27.371]  And they're spreading, most of their stories are anti-Trump articles, and they were spread by millions of people on Facebook and Twitter that had no idea they were reading and spreading fake news.
[00:30:28.482 --> 00:30:34.786]  And this was all supposedly to promote a movie about a fake medical cure.
[00:30:35.026 --> 00:30:36.107]  That's my understanding.
[00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:36.867]  That's right.
[00:30:36.887 --> 00:30:39.729]  So Fox decided, well, this would be a great idea.
[00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.652]  Let's just proliferate a bunch of fake news sites as a sort of promotion.
[00:30:44.672 --> 00:30:49.896]  I don't even know how, but as a promotion for a film about a fake cure.
[00:30:51.033 --> 00:30:56.618]  And now, of course, they're backing off away from it because everybody's discovered this and it's completely insane.
[00:30:57.259 --> 00:31:00.662]  And it's just another example of the pot calling the kettle black here.
[00:31:02.614 --> 00:31:06.075]  Mainstream news is the purveyor of fake news.
[00:31:06.235 --> 00:31:06.995]  Always has been.
[00:31:07.175 --> 00:31:07.836]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:31:08.396 --> 00:31:16.258]  And they are a dying media and no better proof than the election of Donald Trump, the ultimate anti-establishment president.
[00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:18.999]  I think we're seeing a lot of Trump backlash.
[00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:22.860]  That's why they're going after, you know, nomorefakenews.com.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.162]  They're certainly going after Alex Jones and Infowars, and they're certainly going after Donald Trump.
[00:31:28.043 --> 00:31:29.946]  John Rappaport, you have the last word.
[00:31:30.327 --> 00:31:31.449]  What do you think is next?
[00:31:31.529 --> 00:31:33.112]  What's the next big attack?
[00:31:33.713 --> 00:31:39.584]  How are they going to try to stop America 2.0 and the return of the Republic?
[00:31:41.223 --> 00:31:46.604]  Well, it looks like what they're doing is picking off or trying to pick off people around Trump one at a time.
[00:31:46.744 --> 00:31:49.064]  Flynn and Sessions.
[00:31:50.165 --> 00:31:51.205]  They'll continue that.
[00:31:51.685 --> 00:32:02.727]  And eventually, sooner or later, they'll get to Trump and they'll try to say that he committed impeachable offenses and so on and so forth and just continue the babble campaign.
[00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:08.748]  But it could get a lot worse because they're also going to try to censor and limit
[00:32:09.562 --> 00:32:16.486]  Independent news media where, you know, increasing millions of people are getting their truthful news from.
[00:32:16.546 --> 00:32:20.348]  So it's kind of a squeeze play and it's going to continue.
[00:32:20.508 --> 00:32:20.888]  That's right.
[00:32:20.908 --> 00:32:28.932]  They're definitely going to try to take over the independent media and the Internet as a whole, because that's the only way they can control the masses.
[00:32:29.252 --> 00:32:30.793]  John Ratport, thanks for your time.
[00:32:30.893 --> 00:32:32.554]  It's good to have you on our side.
[00:32:33.094 --> 00:32:37.437]  And I just want to remind everybody to check out the website NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[00:32:37.477 --> 00:32:37.877]  Thanks again.
[00:32:38.513 --> 00:32:38.979]  Thanks, Jim.
[00:32:38.999 --> 00:32:39.789]  I appreciate it.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:08.373 --> 00:37:13.394]  Welcome to this InfoWars coverage of President Trump's weekly address.
[00:37:13.494 --> 00:37:19.135]  We expect the weekly address to be posted live here on Facebook in just a minute.
[00:37:19.395 --> 00:37:31.898]  And actually, we're not really sure if this is going to be a pre-recorded speech or if he might actually be doing this live from the air, because before we came on, Fox News was just reporting that Trump was taking off for Orlando.
[00:37:33.078 --> 00:37:43.763]  And it looks like we've got some images right now of President Trump either getting ready to get on a helicopter on a, it looks like a large naval vessel.
[00:37:44.343 --> 00:37:52.927]  I'm not sure exactly what is going on, but we're going to have live coverage of Donald Trump's weekly address and we plan on doing this for you.
[00:37:53.007 --> 00:38:00.511]  Whenever Trump goes live, has a big event, a big address, the weekly address, we're going to bring it to you live here on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[00:38:00.891 --> 00:38:08.013]  And I was actually speaking with some of the crew before we came on here, and one of them mentioned how this reminded him of FDR's fireside chats.
[00:38:08.534 --> 00:38:17.197]  And this is something that Trump can do to skip over the filter of the mainstream news, which we know is not going to report on him accurately.
[00:38:17.257 --> 00:38:20.018]  At least a lot of outlets out there, that's what we've seen.
[00:38:21.018 --> 00:38:24.799]  It does appear right now that Trump is getting off of the helicopter.
[00:38:24.819 --> 00:38:25.880]  I think that's him, guys.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.361]  He's got his USA hat on, the 45 presidential hat.
[00:38:30.217 --> 00:38:33.762]  And he is shaking hands with some, it looks like, naval commanders out there.
[00:38:35.066 --> 00:38:41.992]  So I wonder if Trump is planning on giving this address right there on this vessel, or if this is just a replay.
[00:38:42.012 --> 00:38:44.133]  But nonetheless, we're going to have the live coverage for you.
[00:38:44.694 --> 00:38:48.457]  And like I said, anytime Trump goes live, we plan on bringing you this coverage.
[00:38:48.777 --> 00:38:56.964]  And the way we're able to do it is when you go to InfoWarsTore.com, you buy our products, you support this broadcast, all kinds of great stuff there, supplements.
[00:38:57.024 --> 00:39:00.546]  I know that there's going to be big news breaking on that coming next week.
[00:39:01.327 --> 00:39:03.129]  Dr. Ed Group announced yesterday on the show.
[00:39:03.789 --> 00:39:06.712]  But back to what I was saying about filtering over the mainstream media.
[00:39:06.732 --> 00:39:07.472]  There's our website.
[00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:08.473]  Please go there, support us.
[00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:12.396]  The new Trump-Pence 2020 shirts are a hot ticket item right now.
[00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:13.297]  50% off.
[00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:14.859]  You're basically buying those at cost.
[00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:19.683]  Where else can you get a cool t-shirt for 10 bucks, folks?
[00:39:21.226 --> 00:39:23.828]  If you want a t-shirt for ten bucks, it's usually just gonna be a plain color.
[00:39:23.868 --> 00:39:26.790]  We got a beautiful print on there, and this is what we can do.
[00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:37.118]  My fellow Americans, I'm joining you today from the deck of what will be our nation's newest aircraft carrier, the soon-to-be-commissioned Gerald R. Ford.
[00:39:37.318 --> 00:39:42.302]  And as you can see, I'm wearing a jacket and a hat that they just gave me.
[00:39:42.802 --> 00:39:45.184]  Not really used to it, but it feels awfully good.
[00:39:45.224 --> 00:39:46.505]  I'm very proud of it, actually.
[00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:56.010]  Our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might, projecting power and our totally unparalleled strength at sea.
[00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:07.256]  This beautiful new warship represents the future of naval aviation and she will serve as a cornerstone of our national defense for decades and decades to come.
[00:40:08.597 --> 00:40:25.877]  A famous aviator once wrote that to build a truly great ship, we shouldn't begin by gathering wood, cutting boards, or distributing work, but instead by awakening within the people a desire for the vast and endless sea.
[00:40:26.398 --> 00:40:26.958]  So true.
[00:40:27.979 --> 00:40:36.643]  In the same way, we must continue to renew the American spirit in order to rebuild our country, and rebuild it we will.
[00:40:37.424 --> 00:40:47.909]  On Tuesday, before a joint session to Congress, I laid out a version, I hope you all watched, for how to accomplish that national rebuilding.
[00:40:48.869 --> 00:40:56.715]  My vision includes the elimination of the defense sequester, which has imposed steep cuts on our military.
[00:40:57.676 --> 00:41:13.627]  We must give our sailors, soldiers, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen the tools, equipment, resources, and training they need to get the job done and get it done right, especially in these very dangerous times.
[00:41:14.748 --> 00:41:27.420]  The active-duty army has been reduced by more than 85,000 men since 2009, and we have over 18,000 fewer active-duty Marines.
[00:41:28.441 --> 00:41:40.212]  Air Force, it's the smallest it's been since 1947, and their planes are, on average, nearly 30 years old, if you can believe that.
[00:41:41.233 --> 00:41:47.979]  Our Navy's fleet is the smallest it's been since World War I, and that's a long time ago.
[00:41:47.999 --> 00:41:55.386]  Frontline Navy and Marine strike fighter aircraft are more likely to be down for maintenance than to be in the sky.
[00:41:56.126 --> 00:41:58.929]  We cannot afford to continue down this path.
[00:41:59.509 --> 00:42:11.334]  My budget will give America's armed forces the resources they need to achieve full and total military preparedness to meet any and all global challenges.
[00:42:11.854 --> 00:42:13.615]  And meet them, we will.
[00:42:14.635 --> 00:42:18.137]  Investing in the military means investing in peace.
[00:42:18.857 --> 00:42:26.020]  Because the best way to prevent war, as George Washington said, is to be prepared for it.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:35.368]  Most importantly, an investment in the military is an investment in the incredible men and women who serve our country in uniform.
[00:42:36.189 --> 00:42:37.570]  They are the best of us.
[00:42:38.291 --> 00:42:46.198]  They are the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known, and we will support them every single step of the way.
[00:42:47.199 --> 00:42:49.300]  These are truly exciting times.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:59.302]  Amazing opportunities are unfolding before us to strengthen our military, to reboot our economy, and to bring back our jobs.
[00:43:00.142 --> 00:43:04.823]  If we all work together and put our country first, then anything is possible.
[00:43:05.463 --> 00:43:11.645]  Let us seize this moment and make the most of this incredible opportunity for national renewal.
[00:43:12.525 --> 00:43:21.889]  May God bless the men and women of our military and may God bless the United States of America, the country we love.
[00:43:24.811 --> 00:43:29.853]  All right, so there was Donald Trump's weekly address from the new naval vessel.
[00:43:30.513 --> 00:43:32.954]  He was very proud of himself with that naval vessel.
[00:43:33.114 --> 00:43:34.035]  I think you could see it.
[00:43:34.175 --> 00:43:35.235]  He was glad to be on it.
[00:43:35.355 --> 00:43:41.278]  He was glad that probably the naval officers that are on the vessel with him are appreciative.
[00:43:41.898 --> 00:43:46.542]  Of his efforts, of his presence, and of all the things he's doing for the military.
[00:43:46.602 --> 00:43:48.744]  Just some things that I took away from that.
[00:43:49.504 --> 00:43:55.189]  Like I said, he seemed to be very proud of the Navy, proud of his relationship with the Navy, proud to be working with the Navy.
[00:43:55.889 --> 00:44:02.474]  And it looks like he's really proud of what he's done for the Navy and getting this new vessel for them.
[00:44:03.075 --> 00:44:05.056]  He talks about rebuilding the country.
[00:44:05.737 --> 00:44:06.818]  He hit on that a lot.
[00:44:06.838 --> 00:44:07.979]  We've heard a lot about that.
[00:44:08.199 --> 00:44:10.401]  And, you know, rebuilding this country's infrastructure
[00:44:11.485 --> 00:44:13.287]  is so paramount, folks.
[00:44:13.427 --> 00:44:22.517]  And I love it when Donald Trump talks about all the trillions of dollars we spent on war, and now he says we could have rebuilt the country two or maybe even three times with all of that money.
[00:44:22.938 --> 00:44:24.640]  That's so key, that's so on point.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.063]  I mean, I'm sick of driving over roads with potholes, okay?
[00:44:28.624 --> 00:44:30.545]  I mean, I'm not trying to be a meme, but it's 2017.
[00:44:31.105 --> 00:44:33.005]  Like, can I have a road without a pothole on it, please?
[00:44:33.546 --> 00:44:35.526]  So that's the kind of stuff that Donald Trump wants to do.
[00:44:35.566 --> 00:44:37.467]  He wants to drive down a beautiful road.
[00:44:37.867 --> 00:44:49.111]  He wants to get on a beautiful brand new Navy vessel with a bunch of naval officers that are smiling and happy, proud to be wearing their uniform, excited to be on this new ship.
[00:44:49.791 --> 00:44:52.252]  And that's what Donald Trump takes pride in.
[00:44:52.972 --> 00:44:57.094]  He also mentioned eliminating the defense sequester.
[00:44:57.454 --> 00:45:03.816]  It'll be interesting to see exactly what comes of that and how that gets spun in the media.
[00:45:03.856 --> 00:45:05.297]  You know they're going to find a way to spin that.
[00:45:05.677 --> 00:45:07.438]  And I'm expecting them to spin this as well.
[00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:15.281]  He mentioned the military, down 18,000 Marines, down 85,000 in the Army.
[00:45:15.381 --> 00:45:20.704]  He also said smallest Air Force and Navy ever in the military's history.
[00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:23.705]  So I'm sure they're going to be fact-checking him on that.
[00:45:24.126 --> 00:45:28.928]  I doubt Donald Trump would have said that unless he knew it was true, considering the media coverage.
[00:45:29.488 --> 00:45:32.650]  But that is a very interesting thing that he brings to the light.
[00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:41.755]  And this is a conservative issue or this is an issue that has been on a lot of people's minds, especially in the Obama administration, weakening the military.
[00:45:42.456 --> 00:45:45.517]  And now Donald Trump is bringing that to the forefront.
[00:45:45.818 --> 00:45:48.559]  He's bringing that to light, just like he has so many other issues.
[00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:51.181]  And he brought that out today with those numbers.
[00:45:52.001 --> 00:45:54.084]  He talks about rebuilding the country as usual.
[00:45:54.444 --> 00:46:01.151]  He wants to eliminate a defense sequester that's going to help him expand and improve the military as he sees fit.
[00:46:01.671 --> 00:46:10.140]  He mentioned 18,000 Marines and 85,000 people in the Army have been down since 2009 and the smallest Air Force and Navy as well.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.301]  And he wants to rebuild these things.
[00:46:12.921 --> 00:46:17.585]  And he talks about how he is very proud to have his naval hat on, his naval jacket on.
[00:46:17.985 --> 00:46:19.786]  And this is the real Donald Trump, folks.
[00:46:20.066 --> 00:46:26.710]  I mean, the guy really enjoys nice things and he likes other people to enjoy the nice things that he's also enjoying.
[00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.812]  So that's why he was very proud of himself today.
[00:46:29.352 --> 00:46:34.856]  And that was pretty much the main points from Donald Trump's weekly address.
[00:46:35.296 --> 00:46:36.618]  So we'll go ahead and sign off.
[00:46:36.658 --> 00:46:37.859]  Thanks for everybody that tuned in.
[00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:41.463]  Thanks to everybody who goes to Infowarsstore.com to support us.
[00:46:41.723 --> 00:46:43.084]  Thanks to the crew that came in early.
[00:46:43.325 --> 00:46:48.330]  And again, we're going to be doing this on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube, the Alex Jones Facebook channel everywhere.
[00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:53.516]  Whenever Trump is live, whenever there's an event, we're going to try to bring it to you with our commentary as well.
[00:46:53.536 --> 00:46:54.937]  So thanks for you for tuning in.
[00:46:55.258 --> 00:46:57.160]  That's been Donald Trump's Weekly Address.
[00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:07.760]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.421 --> 00:47:10.021]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.402 --> 00:47:15.404]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.744 --> 00:47:21.207]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.587 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.495]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:51.156]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.516 --> 00:48:59.063]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.083 --> 00:48:59.963]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:00.023]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.041 --> 00:49:08.662]  Red alert.
[00:49:09.142 --> 00:49:10.503]  This is not a drill.
[00:49:10.823 --> 00:49:15.267]  The Democratic Party has been seen with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
[00:49:15.487 --> 00:49:25.936]  Recently, Kislyak also visited former Democratic President Obama's White House 22 times between 2009 and 2016, an election year.
[00:49:26.156 --> 00:49:27.978]  Please ignore all common sense.
[00:49:28.318 --> 00:49:29.899]  This is not a drill.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:35.164]  Perhaps this is the way we should approach the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[00:49:35.464 --> 00:49:45.352]  Maybe then, the money trail leading to the Democratic Party behind the mass hysteria damaging President Donald Trump's cabinet will perk up their clogged ears and listen.
[00:49:45.552 --> 00:49:47.113]  Hang on to your seats, America.
[00:49:47.313 --> 00:49:51.596]  We are experiencing the left's pure propagandized turbulence.
[00:49:51.796 --> 00:49:57.341]  Attorney General Sessions cannot possibly lead an investigation into Russian interference
[00:49:58.041 --> 00:50:10.030]  I think as the day has moved on, Aaron, it is clear that the recusal is not enough.
[00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:22.479]  Any connections, contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russians give rise to the supposition that there may have been some involvement.
[00:50:22.879 --> 00:50:25.480]  You've been in Congress a little bit, and you're in leadership.
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.820]  Have you ever met with a Russian ambassador?
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.721]  Not with this Russian ambassador, no.
[00:50:31.021 --> 00:50:31.941]  Is there anything wrong?
[00:50:31.961 --> 00:50:33.481]  I mean, is it normal to meet with ambassadors?
[00:50:35.002 --> 00:50:44.904]  Meanwhile, former President George W. Bush and former President Barack Obama are grappling for the power levers that they no longer control.
[00:50:45.124 --> 00:50:51.945]  But by hook or by crook, Bush and Obama will do anything to appease their deep state handlers.
[00:50:52.305 --> 00:50:58.508]  So many questions about the contacts between Trump associates during the campaign and the Russian government.
[00:50:58.868 --> 00:51:05.871]  As a former president, would you like to see a special prosecutor appointed to look into this once and for all and give the American people answers?
[00:51:06.091 --> 00:51:08.592]  Well, first of all, I think we all need answers.
[00:51:09.353 --> 00:51:12.974]  Whether or not the special prosecutor is the right way to go tonight, you're talking to the wrong guy.
[00:51:12.994 --> 00:51:17.076]  I mean, this is what we talk about when you talk about draining the swamp, right?
[00:51:17.136 --> 00:51:19.117]  I mean, this is a pretty murky swamp here.
[00:51:20.848 --> 00:51:24.870]  Well, it's real murky swamp, and the sad thing is, it's taxpayer money.
[00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.512]  Now look, Martha, I don't care if the donation is to a liberal or conservative group.
[00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:32.994]  This violates the Constitution because only Congress can appropriate money.
[00:51:33.175 --> 00:51:34.115]  This is outrageous.
[00:51:34.355 --> 00:51:46.522]  Former Attorney General Eric Fast and Furious Holder is heralding the second coming of Obama, while Obama's globalist handler, Valerie Jarrett, is moving into Obama's D.C.
[00:51:46.702 --> 00:51:49.103]  community organizer command base.
[00:51:49.403 --> 00:51:55.338]  Do you have any concerns about that the Obama administration was concerned that this intelligence might be destroyed or ignored?
[00:51:55.358 --> 00:51:57.663]  That seems pretty far-fetched.
[00:51:58.916 --> 00:52:01.417]  I don't even know who, because I think those were unnamed Obama officials.
[00:52:01.517 --> 00:52:12.503]  So, I mean, if those Obama officials have, former Obama officials have those concerns, it'd be pretty easy to stand up in front of a press conference like I'm doing now and talk about those concerns with all of you.
[00:52:12.923 --> 00:52:21.427]  I would suggest that you guys go chase them down, sit outside of their house and ask them if they have concerns about whether or not the FBI and other agencies were going to conduct an investigation.
[00:52:21.547 --> 00:52:24.009]  How are the Democrats affecting foreign policy?
[00:52:24.369 --> 00:52:27.912]  AP reports the Foreign Ministry said it was media vandalism.
[00:52:28.112 --> 00:52:38.380]  The uproar is widely seen in Moscow as parts of efforts by President Donald Trump's political foes to block any possible attempts at a rapprochement with Russia.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.741]  The big question here is, why Russia?
[00:52:40.882 --> 00:52:46.666]  The Chinese are the communists colluding with the deep state lobbyists infesting the United States government.
[00:52:46.886 --> 00:53:03.036]  Maybe the time has come to dust off the little-known Communist Control Act signed into law by President Eisenhower in 1954, outlawing the Communist Party of the United States and support for communist organizations whose objectives include communist collusion.
[00:53:03.136 --> 00:53:06.918]  The Democrats have a giant communist chip on their shoulder.
[00:53:07.158 --> 00:53:11.541]  Inevitably, the Providence of the United States of America will have to knock it off.
[00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.582]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:29.593]  In January, we had audio tapes emerge that showed that John Kerry was talking about the fact that they were going to use ISIS as leverage against Assad.
[00:53:30.053 --> 00:53:34.495]  He said, we saw that ISIS was getting stronger, that they were threatening to go to Damascus and so forth.
[00:53:34.535 --> 00:53:35.656]  We're watching it get stronger.
[00:53:35.696 --> 00:53:39.718]  We knew that Assad was getting threatened, but we thought we could manage this.
[00:53:39.758 --> 00:53:41.098]  Well, they did more than manage it.
[00:53:41.198 --> 00:53:42.839]  They gave arms to them.
[00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:44.600]  Kerry also admitted that they armed them.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:49.462]  And of course, we've had John McCain begging for this, saying, let's arm the moderate rebels.
[00:53:50.082 --> 00:53:51.243]  OK, they're not moderate rebels.
[00:53:51.883 --> 00:53:55.386]  These people, 70% of them, are openly with Al-Qaeda.
[00:53:55.606 --> 00:53:56.747]  You can't trust the other 30%.
[00:53:58.088 --> 00:54:03.393]  John McCain's objective in Syria is regime change, just like it is here in America.
[00:54:03.413 --> 00:54:15.303]  You have to understand, John McCain is a political spokesman for the surveillance state that is putting out leaks and fake information to discredit and to remove from office Donald Trump.
[00:54:16.064 --> 00:54:17.185]  That's John Kerry that's doing this.
[00:54:17.325 --> 00:54:22.209]  In February, we had John Kerry go yet again to meet with rebels in Syria.
[00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:27.174]  And as the headlines reported from ABC News, McCain makes a secret trip to Syria.
[00:54:27.894 --> 00:54:33.799]  And then we had in CBS, they say McCain sneaks across the Turkey-Syria border and meets with rebels.
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:40.185]  We see following that that Syria's water supply was cut off by Turkey after he met with Erdogan.
[00:54:41.166 --> 00:54:44.048]  Understand that McCain is a force for war.
[00:54:44.148 --> 00:54:47.531]  He wants Syrian rebels to be armed so they can shoot down Russian planes.
[00:54:47.591 --> 00:54:49.292]  He's pushed the situation in the Ukraine.
[00:54:49.332 --> 00:54:51.714]  He's pushed unrest in Libya and Syria.
[00:54:52.591 --> 00:54:59.376]  He is part of the perpetual war state, the military-industrial complex, the CIA, that is opposed to Donald Trump.
[00:54:59.856 --> 00:55:02.718]  And so this is what John McCain has created.
[00:55:03.079 --> 00:55:05.681]  This is why they are pushing against Donald Trump.
[00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:07.902]  This is the surveillance state side of this.
[00:55:07.962 --> 00:55:14.487]  Of course, what Barack Obama is doing, he's very much tied in with the same people, and they're doing it from a political standpoint.
[00:55:14.547 --> 00:55:19.371]  All of this information that's coming out, understand that McCain represents the Republican side of it.
[00:55:19.471 --> 00:55:20.552]  And throughout this week,
[00:55:21.232 --> 00:55:25.514]  We have also seen George W. Bush showing his true colors.
[00:55:25.534 --> 00:55:28.316]  We've always known that he was phony opposition.
[00:55:28.576 --> 00:55:30.017]  We've always known that he was a rhino.
[00:55:30.057 --> 00:55:41.183]  But starting Monday morning, he went on the Today Show and he started talking about how the travel ban was going to infringe on people's right to worship.
[00:55:41.943 --> 00:55:49.610]  And how we had to push back on Trump's attacks on the free press, saying, you know, you got to really guard against people who become arrogant with power.
[00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.413]  What he did was he took both parts of the First Amendment.
[00:55:53.033 --> 00:55:54.735]  He twisted them and he inverted them.
[00:55:54.755 --> 00:55:57.297]  You do not have a right of immigration.
[00:55:58.018 --> 00:56:04.043]  And to say that we're not going to bring people in from seven countries that Obama and McCain started wars with,
[00:56:04.804 --> 00:56:10.108]  Presumably because they're dangerous, and because we can't vet those people, they turn that into religious persecution.
[00:56:10.168 --> 00:56:11.509]  That's what George Bush is doing.
[00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:15.751]  Adopting all of the talking points of the left, and of course, going on their programs.
[00:56:15.811 --> 00:56:20.314]  Going on with Ellen DeGeneres, saying we have to guard against Putin.
[00:56:20.455 --> 00:56:24.257]  This is George W. Bush, saying he's going to push, push, push until somebody stands up to him.
[00:56:24.878 --> 00:56:29.280]  He says that he's not really talking in coded speech when he goes on with Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:32.703]  He says, I'm not really criticizing Donald Trump with coded speech, no.
[00:56:33.801 --> 00:56:36.262]  It's very coded, and it's not really being disguised.
[00:56:36.302 --> 00:56:42.025]  And then, of course, just as he's done with Bill Clinton, he is now gushing over Michelle Obama.
[00:56:42.125 --> 00:56:44.806]  Remember, he called Bill Clinton his brother from another mother.
[00:56:45.326 --> 00:56:56.351]  Now he is saying that Michelle Obama is somebody that he immediately liked, and so he is showing himself to be part of the opposition, just as McCain is.
[00:56:56.371 --> 00:57:00.413]  We have to understand how serious this is, with Obama setting up shop in D.C.
[00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:15.441]  The Obama administration has been implicated in laundering billions of dollars through a Department of Justice slush fund scheme to activist groups, according to the congressional investigators.
[00:57:15.501 --> 00:57:22.386]  And these same investigators are estimating that it may be around three billion dollars that went to these non-victim groups.
[00:57:22.706 --> 00:57:29.991]  Some of these groups include the National Council of La Raza, Reinvestment Coalition, and the National Urban League.
[00:57:30.031 --> 00:57:30.872]  So was Obama
[00:57:31.292 --> 00:57:31.672]  I think so.
[00:57:50.742 --> 00:57:51.202]  I think so.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:21.013]  President Trump could very well go after him for stealing billions of dollars or some of the many other crimes or violations of the Constitution that we know that Obama has committed.
[00:58:21.473 --> 00:58:22.735]  So it's very interesting to see here.
[00:58:22.755 --> 00:58:24.116]  This is breaking news guys.
