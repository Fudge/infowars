[00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:10.282]  Across the country are being invaded by cowardly communist scum known as Antifa.
[00:00:10.883 --> 00:00:17.849]  In the microcosm of Austin, Texas, the University of Texas at Austin in particular, this growing threat
[00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.810]  Is about to reach a breaking point.
[00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.133]  Is a subversive criminal organization using the University of Texas as a recruiting center?
[00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:30.834]  Namely the Red Guards of Austin and the Revolutionary Student Front.
[00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:34.336]  And is the University of Texas aware of these developments?
[00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:58.756]  If our office, as the office responsible for student conduct, if we are able to identify an individual student or students who we are able to find responsible based on evidence, there would be administrative sanctions at the university level as well, separate from criminal responsibility.
[00:00:59.256 --> 00:01:03.379]  UT fraternities have been targeted with vandalism by the Red Guards of Austin.
[00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.523]  The Red Guards' Facebook page claims that UT fraternities promote rape culture.
[00:01:08.863 --> 00:01:18.710]  A group simply labeling themselves as the Vandals of UT Austin posted this, quote, let us make racists, frat brothers, and the administration afraid again.
[00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.890]  Afraid of students.
[00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:22.232]  Afraid of the marginalized and harassed.
[00:01:22.412 --> 00:01:24.914]  Afraid of the exploited and excluded.
[00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:40.785]  Some individuals claiming to be rogue actors and not connected with other organizations anonymously claimed responsibility for some of the vandalism on the private residences west of our campus.
[00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:42.986]  And that is certainly very frustrating.
[00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:47.208]  The Revolutionary Student Front is not a student organization.
[00:01:47.888 --> 00:01:54.531]  Our university does not have any rules against political or personal belief.
[00:01:55.892 --> 00:02:02.918]  Our institutional rules are in support of our educational mission, because that is why our students are here, is to learn and to grow.
[00:02:03.398 --> 00:02:11.786]  But our rules are also, they're about how our students treat each other, and how they treat this campus, and those educational goals.
[00:02:12.226 --> 00:02:14.308]  And that's really what our mission is.
[00:02:14.428 --> 00:02:24.539]  The Revolutionary Student Front has even targeted the president of the University of Texas, Greg Fenves, stating, And now these communist groups are bringing their message to the Austin public at large.
[00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:50.676]  On February 11, 2017, Antifa Red Guards Austin member Lisa Hogan was arrested for aggravated assault when she threw rocks at the patrons of Eastside Tavern while marching in favor of the anti-gentrification movement in East Austin.
[00:02:50.876 --> 00:02:56.922]  Antifa members are now bringing loaded guns to protest rallies after publicly intending to use them.
[00:02:57.142 --> 00:03:13.657]  From their Facebook page, quote, there is nothing less desirable to and more hated by the state and powers that be than a Maoist Communist Party because unlike other so-called parties, it exists for one reason, the violent overthrow of the existing order.
[00:03:13.857 --> 00:03:15.639]  This means armed struggle.
[00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.421]  The establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the continuation of revolution in the period of socialism.
[00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:33.325]  Recently, it became public knowledge that the George Soros-funded Antifa group is selling concealed knives on their website intended for, quote, slicing conservatives.
[00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:35.646]  But Antifa has a big problem.
[00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:38.007]  We don't want them here and they don't belong.
[00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:38.967]  18 U.S.
[00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:40.988]  Code 2385, a U.S.
[00:03:41.048 --> 00:03:44.049]  code against advocating the overthrow of the government, states,
[00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:59.368]  Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years or both.
[00:03:59.608 --> 00:04:18.662]  And of course there's a long-standing 63-year act signed into law by President Eisenhower titled the Communist Control Act of 1954 that stated the Communist Party was described as an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the government and a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the United States.
[00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:29.331]  The act made membership to the Communist Party a criminal act and stipulated that all party members would be sanctioned with up to a $10,000 fine or imprisonment for five years or both.
[00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:34.315]  Despite that, no administration or law enforcement has tried to enforce it.
[00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:35.356]  Law enforcement.
[00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:43.903]  Obama's socialist, communist, Islamic meanderings no longer hold a hypnotic sway over these United States of America.
[00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:45.004]  It's simple.
[00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:50.689]  Calling out for the overthrow of the United States government is not protected by free speech.
[00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.713]  In fact, it is illegal according to 18 Code 2385.
[00:04:56.475 --> 00:04:57.756]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:04:58.297 --> 00:04:59.818]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.023]  Infowars wouldn't exist without you.
[00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:13.365]  You are the Infowar.
[00:05:13.585 --> 00:05:20.816]  During that 30-plus hour live transmission that kicked off Wednesday and ran right through Thursday, we saw massive, massive support.
[00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:24.561]  Spreading the word, spreading the articles, and our free newsletters.
[00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:25.663]  We can stay in contact.
[00:05:25.743 --> 00:05:26.464]  It's been amazing.
[00:05:26.604 --> 00:05:34.490]  That's why I'm going to go ahead and extend some of the biggest sales we've had in six months right through this weekend, right through until Monday morning.
[00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:47.081]  We have a giant 30% off discount on ProPure King Water Filters, the big, nice tabletop stainless steel Rolls-Royce model that cuts out all the garbage but leaves the good minerals in.

[00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:54.991]  That's going to be selling out very, very soon.
[00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:59.137]  More is coming in the next few weeks, but I will keep that discounted until it sells out.
[00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:01.239]  That may come before Monday.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.343]  20% off our Methylcobalamin Pure Organic.
[00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:07.766]  Vitamin B12, that's so amazing, you take under the tongue.

[00:06:17.171 --> 00:06:18.831]  Prostagard, an amazing formula.
[00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:19.812]  20% off.

[00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:30.317]  Amazing.
[00:06:30.397 --> 00:06:31.158]  Game-changing.
[00:06:31.238 --> 00:06:32.018]  Tip of the spear.
[00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:35.620]  Very best out there from our years of research from the top labs.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.761]  Then of course we have Living Defense Parasite Cleanse.
[00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:39.081]  That's 20% off.
[00:06:40.322 --> 00:06:44.668]  We have DNA Force that's back in stock for a limited time, and much, much more.
[00:06:44.688 --> 00:06:45.909]  There's a lot of other specials.

[00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:16.738]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:08:16.838 --> 00:08:19.121]  You better believe you got one!
[00:08:21.264 --> 00:08:26.151]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.566 --> 00:08:45.149]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.851]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:51.455]  The internet didn't get invented on its own.
[00:08:59.227 --> 00:08:59.587]  I think?
[00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:17.932]  We're good to go.
[00:09:33.737 --> 00:09:38.420]  Trump has had a spectacular victory with the repeal and overhaul of Obamacare.
[00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:50.168]  But an even bigger victory is the American people and the Freedom Caucus that forced the first version of the bill that Paul Ryan and the Republican blue blood scum tried to sneak through.
[00:09:50.188 --> 00:10:02.997]  That monstrosity was only maybe 30-40% better than Obamacare that Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the main architects, as well as Jonathan Gruber, another architect, admitted was designed to bankrupt our healthcare system and bring in a
[00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:12.143]  This is a big victory and it puts it into the Senate's hands and the Republicans there, Rand Paul and of course Senator Cruz and others who have really good voters.
[00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:36.129]  Yes.
[00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:03.269]  The word is Kennedy stepping down is imminent.
[00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.132]  So a lot of good things happening because we fought back and took action.
[00:11:07.472 --> 00:11:09.034]  Do we expect instant gratification?
[00:11:09.054 --> 00:11:09.094]  No.
[00:11:09.114 --> 00:11:11.136]  Do we expect a bed of roses?
[00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:11.396]  No.
[00:11:12.116 --> 00:11:19.683]  But really really exciting powerful things are happening thanks to you out there taking action promoting Americana.
[00:11:20.203 --> 00:11:25.388]  Promoting free market capitalism and open free society compared to Venezuela or Cuba or so
[00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:25.928]  Yeah.
[00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:46.733]  I don't
[00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:06.255]  Yes.
[00:12:26.265 --> 00:12:27.145]  We're good to go.
[00:12:51.850 --> 00:13:00.197]  Obama, you were tearing America down under globalism and selling off our industry and our ideas to special interests that you and others were profiting from in your global system.
[00:13:00.698 --> 00:13:04.201]  So to have you say you have a business, you didn't build it, somebody else did.
[00:13:04.221 --> 00:13:08.945]  Now you're saying you built the last eight years when you were the one tearing things down.
[00:13:08.965 --> 00:13:12.668]  Now you accuse Trump of tearing things down when all he's doing is tearing the
[00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:17.055]  Yeah.
[00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.310]  I think so.
[00:13:57.682 --> 00:14:10.033]  saying it's cultural appropriation to try to make us not have any melting pot culture, but to have a corporate culture of cult-like control, of tackling free speech, where Bill Nye the science guy now bans saying that chromosomes make men and women.
[00:14:10.553 --> 00:14:11.894]  I mean, science is under attack.
[00:14:11.954 --> 00:14:12.855]  Science is real.
[00:14:13.115 --> 00:14:17.819]  These people claim science isn't real, you know, claiming that man-made global warming is going to kill us all.
[00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:19.281]  Well, the science shows it's not that.
[00:14:19.621 --> 00:14:25.206]  They want man-made global carbon taxes to totally control all of us and in the darkness rule us.
[00:14:25.606 --> 00:14:25.886]  of course.
[00:14:55.473 --> 00:14:57.915]  I salute you all, and thank you all for your support.
[00:14:57.975 --> 00:14:58.915]  Amazing job.
[00:14:59.976 --> 00:15:01.237]  All right, and that was Alex Jones.
[00:15:01.357 --> 00:15:03.378]  I'm David Knight, and we've got a lot of news today.
[00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:06.460]  We've got a lot of information about Obamacare that we're going to be talking about.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.684]  As Alex pointed out, we have Michael DeBerry, a guy who, if you've been to New Orleans and the French Quarter, you've seen him there.
[00:15:12.724 --> 00:15:16.466]  He's got a booth set up there where he broadcasts our show.
[00:15:16.586 --> 00:15:19.708]  Very interesting encounters that he gets, and you'll see that on his YouTube channel.
[00:15:19.728 --> 00:15:20.669]  Of course, he had one.
[00:15:21.049 --> 00:15:26.954]  Our teacher wants to kill Alex because he basically brainwashed her son.
[00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:27.975]  Her son agreed with us.
[00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:29.196]  She didn't have anything to say.
[00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:32.099]  She just wanted to censor us, which is what we always see.
[00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:36.483]  Maybe if she had talked to her son, maybe there would be a discussion there.
[00:15:36.523 --> 00:15:38.865]  Maybe she would understand his position.
[00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:41.907]  Maybe she might have learned something or maybe she could have convinced him.
[00:15:41.947 --> 00:15:42.448]  Who knows?
[00:15:43.188 --> 00:15:44.410]  But that's not what the left wants to do.
[00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.591]  They just want to censor people.
[00:15:45.631 --> 00:15:47.873]  But I want to focus at this point
[00:15:48.863 --> 00:15:53.966]  What Alex referenced earlier, this is the article that's up on Infowars.com by Steve Watson.
[00:15:54.507 --> 00:16:01.411]  Obama says the Trump presidency is like watching a business he'd built for eight years being slowly ripped down.
[00:16:02.072 --> 00:16:16.061]  You know, Obama, many Americans understand exactly what that feels like because many people in America watch their businesses being slowly ripped down by you over those eight years.
[00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:18.422]  You really didn't build anything, okay?
[00:16:18.742 --> 00:16:21.563]  What you were doing was you're building a socialist wall.
[00:16:22.664 --> 00:16:26.646]  Just like George Washington said, we walk about freely but between high walls.
[00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:30.648]  You made the walls much higher, you made them much narrower with your socialism.
[00:16:31.268 --> 00:16:34.830]  You know, your big monument to yourself was Obamacare.
[00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.631]  You're seeing this coming down.
[00:16:36.671 --> 00:16:43.294]  Of course, it was terminally ill, it was going to die, and now the Republicans are just kind of hurrying this along, removing the life support.
[00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:44.715]  We really need to pull the plug on it.
[00:16:45.595 --> 00:16:49.879]  And remove the life support that you're stealing from investors.
[00:16:49.999 --> 00:16:52.602]  The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors.
[00:16:53.122 --> 00:16:55.525]  As Jerome Corsi has been pointing out for several months now.
[00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:59.409]  This whole subsidy scam that you've got going here.
[00:16:59.789 --> 00:17:01.671]  Really, we ought to call it Venezuelan Care.
[00:17:02.572 --> 00:17:03.733]  Because that's truly what it is.
[00:17:04.642 --> 00:17:18.431]  Just as Hugo Chavez and Maduro like to fund their failing government, their failing society, by theft, by stealing automobile factories, by stealing oil companies, oil drilling companies, etc.
[00:17:18.931 --> 00:17:23.174]  They think they can keep this socialism going, but as Margaret Thatcher said, eventually you run out of other people's money.
[00:17:23.274 --> 00:17:26.537]  Well, you haven't run out of Fannie and Freddie investors.
[00:17:27.077 --> 00:17:29.779]  You've been robbing Fannie and Freddie to feed Hillary and Barry.
[00:17:30.499 --> 00:17:31.600]  And that's going to play out.
[00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:32.905]  Okay?
[00:17:33.266 --> 00:17:34.047]  That's what you built.
[00:17:34.567 --> 00:17:36.329]  You built it on borrowed money.
[00:17:36.349 --> 00:17:37.370]  You didn't pay for it.
[00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:38.571]  Okay?
[00:17:38.732 --> 00:17:49.683]  And we're going to take a look at this half a billion dollar presidential center that he's building to himself as Zero Hedge says, it's like something that would make the pharaohs jealous.
[00:17:51.517 --> 00:17:52.658]  It truly is amazing.
[00:17:52.898 --> 00:17:56.020]  We'll show some pictures of that on that article here, but let's see what he says.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.640]  It's an article from Politico.
[00:17:58.221 --> 00:18:07.946]  Cites Obama insiders describing how the former president feels about watching Donald Trump conduct affairs from the White House, and it will make satisfying readers for Trump supporters.
[00:18:08.066 --> 00:18:10.267]  Okay, because a little bit of schadenfreude here.
[00:18:10.728 --> 00:18:18.012]  The article says that Obama has displayed a range of emotions with regard to Trump, including stoicism, fear, and sad frustration.
[00:18:18.772 --> 00:18:20.654]  And of course it's like washing his business.
[00:18:20.714 --> 00:18:21.715]  It's not a business.
[00:18:22.656 --> 00:18:26.880]  This is nothing but socialist theft that you have created here.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.824]  And what he did was a monument to really the way America is.
[00:18:30.884 --> 00:18:31.885]  It is a mixture.
[00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:41.834]  Obamacare, like our current government, is a mixture of socialism, where you steal from one group of people and then hand it off to other people, and also crony capitalism.
[00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:47.737]  Where you reward certain businesses or you require people to buy a certain product.
[00:18:48.338 --> 00:18:53.320]  And so what we have with Obamacare is a interesting mixture that reflects what American government currently is.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.982]  A mixture of socialism and economic fascism or crony capitalism if you want to call it that way.
[00:18:58.857 --> 00:18:59.818]  And then he went on to say this.
[00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:03.700]  He said it's not in anyone's interest for President Obama to become the face of resistance.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.062]  That's a former Obama aide, Eric Schultz, who's still his senior advisor.
[00:19:08.222 --> 00:19:14.506]  He said when the former president speaks, he consumes a lot of oxygen and he can suppress the next generation of leaders from rising.
[00:19:14.746 --> 00:19:19.429]  I thought it was interesting because he said it's not for Obama to become the face of the resistance.
[00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:20.709]  We just saw Hillary Clinton
[00:19:21.863 --> 00:19:26.628]  Celebrating 100 years of Planned Parenthood, saying, I am the resistance now.
[00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.191]  I am joining the resistance.
[00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:31.254]  She's channeling Alex Jones.
[00:19:31.294 --> 00:19:34.677]  She said in the past, it's an Infowar, and we're losing it.
[00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.580]  Now she says she's part of the resistance.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:41.025]  Maybe it's Hillary Clinton who's copying Alex Jones, and not Barack Obama.
[00:19:42.346 --> 00:19:45.750]  The Presidential Center that they've got there is absolutely amazing.
[00:19:46.011 --> 00:19:57.626]  We're going to take a quick look at that, then we're going to take a look at Obamacare, and we're going to look at some of these insane videos of the entitled people who think that they can censor other people's speech.
[00:19:58.326 --> 00:19:59.208]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:20:03.675 --> 00:20:05.596]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:20:05.636 --> 00:20:06.716]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:20:06.977 --> 00:20:07.897]  Why is this so good?
[00:20:08.197 --> 00:20:13.420]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:27.066]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:28.507]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:20:29.407 --> 00:20:30.868]  Spreading disease around.
[00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:33.431]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:34.772]  These are all parasites.
[00:20:34.812 --> 00:20:35.933]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:20:35.953 --> 00:20:36.994]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:20:37.274 --> 00:20:41.597]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:20:41.818 --> 00:20:44.980]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.183]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:20:48.203 --> 00:20:49.204]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:20:49.244 --> 00:20:49.764]  Living Defense.
[00:20:50.064 --> 00:20:51.125]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:52.206]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:54.248]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:56.792]  You support the broadcast.
[00:20:56.852 --> 00:20:57.935]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:20:58.196 --> 00:21:00.101]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:21:00.462 --> 00:21:02.447]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:21:09.139 --> 00:21:11.280]  What is going on when we're all Russian agents?
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.740]  We're all... I mean, I support Trump.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.761]  I get the missile attack made him look strong.
[00:21:15.301 --> 00:21:21.683]  I'm just saying I don't believe the chemical attack was facade because they've caught the rebels doing it before and they don't have any proof he did it.
[00:21:21.743 --> 00:21:22.863]  I'm not even attacking Trump!
[00:21:23.223 --> 00:21:27.944]  In fact, in a Machiavellian way, I'm saying, okay, you blew up an empty airfield and shut them up about how you're a Russian agent.
[00:21:27.984 --> 00:21:29.185]  I kind of sickly support it.
[00:21:29.225 --> 00:21:29.765]  I've admitted that.
[00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:34.548]  Kind of becoming like Machiavelli, because now we've got a guy in there doing their own tricks against them.
[00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:37.530]  But I'm just saying, how do we know Assad did it?
[00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.592]  And now in newspapers everywhere, I am an Assad agent.
[00:21:41.253 --> 00:21:42.133]  We're together!
[00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:43.334]  Look at us!
[00:21:43.995 --> 00:21:45.456]  Gavin, are you getting orders from Assad?
[00:21:46.152 --> 00:21:47.994]  Yeah, I was just talking to him on the phone right now.
[00:21:48.034 --> 00:21:51.276]  He's actually here via Skype on the other TV.
[00:21:51.577 --> 00:21:54.219]  But my thing with that is I go, I don't care.
[00:21:54.239 --> 00:21:55.900]  I don't care if it was actors.
[00:21:56.101 --> 00:21:57.262]  I don't care if they just had kids.
[00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:57.822]  Go like that.
[00:21:58.383 --> 00:22:04.768]  The big picture is that the world saw a bad thing, so the big man has to go boom on the bad thing.
[00:22:05.168 --> 00:22:06.770]  And now women respect him.
[00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.132]  Here in America, they go, oh, the patriarchy's back.
[00:22:09.152 --> 00:22:11.374]  Because we know feminists deep down want the patriarchy.
[00:22:12.054 --> 00:22:16.880]  Obama's legacy is obliterated because he said he would draw a line in the sand and he got cucked.
[00:22:17.361 --> 00:22:18.322]  So that's awesome.
[00:22:18.342 --> 00:22:20.424]  He's killed, as you say, the Russian theory.
[00:22:20.685 --> 00:22:24.269]  I think the neocons even are getting too much hubris, too confident.
[00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:25.270]  They're going to be wiped out.
[00:22:26.872 --> 00:22:31.397]  And the biggest picture is these terrorists are absolute animals.
[00:22:31.738 --> 00:22:33.219]  They dismember our soldiers.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.202]  They tear out beating hearts and eat them.
[00:22:35.462 --> 00:22:40.327]  They sell fingers and the market there for as war trophies.
[00:22:40.367 --> 00:22:44.813]  There's literally a market for body parts just as accoutrements.
[00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:46.853]  So, we don't negotiate with them.
[00:22:46.894 --> 00:22:48.534]  We don't send them democracy.
[00:22:48.794 --> 00:22:50.835]  We just scare them with huge fireworks.
[00:22:51.075 --> 00:22:55.116]  They drop this twenty-something thousand pound bomb and it kills them all.
[00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:59.177]  I mean, that's a finally, and then they say, oh, he wants a military dictatorship.
[00:22:59.217 --> 00:23:01.438]  He says, I've given them total authorization.
[00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:05.079]  There was this, to carry out his constitutional orders.
[00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:09.100]  This micromanaging, call Obama, and he would never answer the phone.
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.541]  Sir, we have, we have been logged in the sites.
[00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:12.081]  We can't kill him.
[00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:12.921]  Oh, yeah.
[00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:14.102]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:14.822]  Gavin, what do you make of that?
[00:23:15.402 --> 00:23:16.864]  I think we crippled our guys over there.
[00:23:16.904 --> 00:23:20.287]  I was talking to Terry Shepard recently and I said, how do we win this war?
[00:23:20.327 --> 00:23:22.048]  And he goes, let us do our job.
[00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:26.292]  I mean, right now they've got RPGs and they go, we're getting shot at from a mosque.
[00:23:26.312 --> 00:23:26.712]  What do we do?
[00:23:26.752 --> 00:23:27.753]  And they've got to call up.
[00:23:28.094 --> 00:23:34.319]  I talked to one vet who told me, he said, our guy had to pretend he misunderstood in order to save our lives.
[00:23:34.339 --> 00:23:36.942]  Because they were shooting from the mosque and the guy said, don't shoot the mosque.
[00:23:36.962 --> 00:23:38.203]  And he said, what was that?
[00:23:38.263 --> 00:23:38.443]  What?
[00:23:38.523 --> 00:23:39.304]  Shoot the mosque?
[00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:40.064]  Oh, what?
[00:23:40.925 --> 00:23:41.546]  This is the end
[00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:17.797]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:17.818 --> 00:24:19.682]  This Friday, May 5th, 2017.
[00:24:20.143 --> 00:24:20.745]  I'm David Knight.
[00:24:21.286 --> 00:24:24.233]  We've been looking at this amazing statement from Politico.
[00:24:25.109 --> 00:24:29.611]  Barack Obama's advisors saying he's very disturbed watching what's happening.
[00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:34.232]  It's like watching the business that he built for eight years being ripped down slowly.
[00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:46.196]  And as I said before, many of us who had businesses watched in stunned silence as Obama from his throne gradually ripped down our businesses.
[00:24:46.316 --> 00:24:48.857]  And for him, he doesn't get the basic
[00:24:49.736 --> 00:24:50.697]  Idea of business.
[00:24:50.817 --> 00:24:53.379]  Business is about sales, really.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.903]  It's about convincing people that you've got a win-win situation.
[00:24:57.923 --> 00:24:59.985]  You offer them something, they agree to the deal.
[00:25:00.085 --> 00:25:02.787]  That's not the business that Obama is in.
[00:25:02.828 --> 00:25:07.792]  If you want to call it a business, his business is holding a gun to your head and mandating what you're going to do.
[00:25:08.553 --> 00:25:12.076]  And that's a big difference between just this Obamacare situation.
[00:25:12.396 --> 00:25:13.277]  With Obamacare,
[00:25:14.298 --> 00:25:15.178]  Everything was a mandate.
[00:25:15.218 --> 00:25:16.139]  Everything was a tax.
[00:25:16.199 --> 00:25:20.520]  What they're trying to do now is give people incentives, give them tax credits.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.601]  Did Obama do anything to really help us buy health insurance?
[00:25:24.641 --> 00:25:24.781]  No.
[00:25:24.841 --> 00:25:31.383]  He gave us a long list of mandates, forced us to buy things that we really didn't need at inflated prices from his friends.
[00:25:31.844 --> 00:25:38.146]  See, the people that he knows in business succeed because they use government to hold a gun to your head and
[00:25:39.446 --> 00:25:40.567]  Forced you to buy their product.
[00:25:41.127 --> 00:25:56.774]  People like Chobani Yogurt, where they get into the school lunch program, and then taxpayers are subsidizing the stuff that's going through the school lunch program, but he makes his business plan by getting subsidies, tax subsidies, from the government by this kind of crony capitalism.
[00:25:56.814 --> 00:26:07.560]  And so all the people that he knows, the big businesses, the connected individuals, they run their businesses by incorporating subsidies and incorporating mandates on you.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.362]  Taking your tax money.
[00:26:09.883 --> 00:26:12.529]  But what is the business that Obama is building right now?
[00:26:12.569 --> 00:26:16.216]  Well, he's building a massive monument to himself.
[00:26:17.324 --> 00:26:18.765]  Obama is selling himself.
[00:26:19.385 --> 00:26:22.027]  And of course he's selling his brand of socialism.
[00:26:22.067 --> 00:26:26.991]  He's unveiling a half billion dollar Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.
[00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:31.434]  Pull up this article and show the people some of these pictures of what they're going to do.
[00:26:31.454 --> 00:26:35.216]  Now of course he's had a 60 million dollar book contract to sell himself.
[00:26:35.737 --> 00:26:37.538]  He's also rolling out on the speech circuit.
[00:26:37.558 --> 00:26:40.320]  He's got 400,000 dollar speeches a pop.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.821]  This is coming from Zero Hedge.
[00:26:42.864 --> 00:26:48.266]  But now we've seen the first peak of the future Obama Presidential Center.
[00:26:48.326 --> 00:26:49.487]  It's not even a library.
[00:26:49.547 --> 00:26:50.267]  It's a center.
[00:26:50.287 --> 00:26:51.428]  A library is just part of that.
[00:26:51.768 --> 00:26:54.889]  And as they point out on Zero Hedge, it would make the pharaohs jealous.
[00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:55.449]  And guess what?
[00:26:55.689 --> 00:26:57.250]  It's going to have a sledding hill.
[00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:58.891]  How appropriate!
[00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:04.333]  Because Obama's policies have always put us on the slippery slope going downhill.
[00:27:06.581 --> 00:27:08.823]  That's a perfect metaphor for Obama.
[00:27:09.344 --> 00:27:10.465]  A slippery slope.
[00:27:10.785 --> 00:27:12.106]  And they're going to feature that there.
[00:27:12.146 --> 00:27:18.292]  Of course, they say that it's a sledding hill because Michelle always complained there was nowhere to sled in Chicago when she was a kid.
[00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:19.813]  So now they've got it there.
[00:27:19.933 --> 00:27:26.939]  And everybody can go to the Obama Center and they can slide downhill, which is what the country did for eight years.
[00:27:28.089 --> 00:27:33.412]  Obama is expected to use the center as a platform to work on issues such as criminal justice reform.
[00:27:34.192 --> 00:27:40.936]  Is he going to push for the reform of the NDAA where we had indefinite detention without trial by the military?
[00:27:41.476 --> 00:27:47.499]  Or where you have assassination of Americans abroad without trial and conviction?
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.301]  That would be a good criminal justice reform, don't you think?
[00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:51.862]  No, he's not going to do that.
[00:27:52.222 --> 00:27:55.624]  And he's not going to have education for underprivileged children.
[00:27:56.204 --> 00:27:58.085]  Guess what kind of education they're going to be getting?
[00:27:58.265 --> 00:28:00.186]  They're going to be getting propaganda.
[00:28:00.206 --> 00:28:03.768]  There's an interesting article that came out today from fee.org.
[00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:07.290]  It said, MIT is making kid-friendly communist propaganda.
[00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:14.894]  I would imagine you will be able to find this book in no time at the Obama Library at the Obama Center in Chicago.
[00:28:14.934 --> 00:28:17.095]  You know, that half-billion-dollar center that they're building.
[00:28:17.715 --> 00:28:20.337]  They say that MIT Press is proposing, quote,
[00:28:20.717 --> 00:28:22.217]  Different kind of communism.
[00:28:22.677 --> 00:28:28.478]  One that is true to the ideals of communism and free from authoritarianism.
[00:28:28.498 --> 00:28:28.938]  Okay.
[00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:30.899]  So it's new and improved communism.
[00:28:31.219 --> 00:28:36.360]  It has 5% less theft, 5% less starving, 5% less murder.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.841]  But it would still be millions of people dying from starvation, murder, and theft.
[00:28:41.081 --> 00:28:48.482]  As I point out, the death toll from communist regimes in the 20th century is well documented by the tens of millions that have died everywhere from
[00:28:49.222 --> 00:28:52.986]  The Russian Revolution to the starvation in China and elsewhere.
[00:28:53.646 --> 00:29:07.759]  And Obama may be getting his own comeuppance because we see from the Daily Mail that Congress is planning to cancel his pension following news of his 60 plus million dollar book deal and his $400,000 speaking fees.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.243]  They say Republicans are going to introduce legislation that would cap presidential pensions.
[00:29:12.904 --> 00:29:15.906]  Now, Obama vetoed that legislation last year.
[00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:16.807]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:29:17.147 --> 00:29:18.889]  He didn't want to have this pension taken.
[00:29:19.289 --> 00:29:20.710]  But they may take it anyway.
[00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:24.273]  I think it would be a great point for Donald Trump and the Republicans to make.
[00:29:24.793 --> 00:29:28.196]  The law would reduce pensions by $1 for every dollar over $400,000 a former president earns.
[00:29:30.738 --> 00:29:32.518]  And that would take him down real quickly.
[00:29:32.558 --> 00:29:38.440]  But of course, we should have welfare for the rich and privileged, like Barack Obama, shouldn't we?
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:38.860]  Yeah.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:39.560]  Stay with us.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.260]  We're going to come back.
[00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:48.823]  We got a message from Alex Jones, and we are also going to be looking at the details of the changes to Obamacare that the House passed yesterday.
[00:29:48.843 --> 00:29:49.183]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.203 --> 00:29:49.663]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.943 --> 00:29:52.844]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.344 --> 00:29:54.944]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.864 --> 00:29:58.565]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.019 --> 00:30:03.247]  We're good.
[00:30:04.349 --> 00:30:13.311]  We all know that when the Democratic Party blamed Hillary Clinton's loss on the Russians, it was the biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever.
[00:30:13.431 --> 00:30:29.135]  But it seems now the vice president of the Democratic political firm Global Strategy Group said that according to their analysis, two-thirds of the voters Obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the Democratic Party to vote for Trump.
[00:30:29.255 --> 00:30:33.956]  So 70% of the reason Hillary Clinton lost can be attributed to her
[00:30:34.036 --> 00:30:36.917]  I'm Millie Weaver, for more reports go to InfoWars.com.
[00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:09.278]  In ancient times, man roamed the earth in a constant state of hunting or being hunted.

[00:31:56.596 --> 00:32:03.041]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds, even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:32:03.261 --> 00:32:11.547]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:32:11.827 --> 00:32:17.470]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.572]  Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:32:20.812 --> 00:32:26.615]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:32:26.915 --> 00:32:27.395]  It works.
[00:32:27.695 --> 00:32:36.000]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.482]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend

[00:32:49.109 --> 00:32:53.552]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.

[00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:16.911]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:17.653 --> 00:33:19.278]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.586 --> 00:33:55.040]  During our 30-plus hour live transmission in defense of free speech and in defense of the West, we have seen an absolute outpouring of support, of listeners spreading our articles and videos, and of people openly pledging to pray for our operation and pray for this country and this world to be set free from the bondage of the purely selfish, evil, satanic forces of globalism.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.422]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:33:57.922 --> 00:33:59.784]  Infowars wouldn't exist without you.
[00:33:59.884 --> 00:34:01.166]  You are the Infowar.
[00:34:01.646 --> 00:34:15.440]  The globalists want to destroy this outlet because they want to destroy a platform where the people can come together for sovereignty and for prosperity and for free market capitalism and for religious freedom and for the nation-state.
[00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:21.345]  And for men and women and families and children that are all under assault.
[00:34:22.085 --> 00:34:31.192]  We have the Bill Nye the Science Guy, a 1990s program cutting out where they break down the X and Y chromosomes and what makes us human, men and women.
[00:34:31.993 --> 00:34:35.916]  Men and women now existing and science is hurtful to someone else.
[00:34:36.716 --> 00:34:45.223]  This is the globalists using our well-meaning openness and our tolerance to get us to hate our species and give up on our life force.
[00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:54.130]  And the attacks calling us fake news by the fake news that CNN and others really show how sick these people are and how they're attempting to shut down free speech.
[00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:59.895]  So in the face of the Federal Reserve Board members suing us and George Soros' law firm launching the suit,
[00:35:01.044 --> 00:35:11.846]  And in the face of Google admittedly censoring us, it is we the people of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood, the human race, that are fighting back and saying no.
[00:35:11.966 --> 00:35:20.528]  So again, during that 30-plus hour live transmission that kicked off Wednesday and ran right through Thursday, we saw massive, massive support.
[00:35:20.808 --> 00:35:24.269]  Spreading the word, spreading the articles, and our free newsletters.
[00:35:24.309 --> 00:35:25.389]  We can stay in contact.
[00:35:25.489 --> 00:35:27.410]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:28.210]  It's been amazing.
[00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.851]  And the financial support has been incredible as well.
[00:35:31.552 --> 00:35:33.553]  Again, we're not funded by George Soros.
[00:35:33.573 --> 00:35:35.154]  We're actually sued by his law firm.
[00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:38.676]  We're not funded by the big Islamic groups.
[00:35:38.696 --> 00:35:39.637]  We're actually sued by them.
[00:35:40.117 --> 00:35:43.279]  We're not empowered by the establishment.
[00:35:43.319 --> 00:35:47.822]  We are empowered by you, your prayers, your support, and your financial support.
[00:35:48.502 --> 00:35:56.367]  That's why I'm going to go ahead and extend some of the biggest sales we've had in six months right through this weekend, right through until Monday morning.
[00:35:56.727 --> 00:36:09.015]  We have a giant 30% off discount on ProPure King water filters, the big, nice tabletop stainless steel Rolls-Royce model that cuts out all the garbage but leaves the good minerals in.
[00:36:09.416 --> 00:36:14.679]  We've got 30% off our amazing Nootropic, and of course that's Brain Force.
[00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:16.880]  That's going to be selling out very, very soon.
[00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:21.023]  More is coming in the next few weeks, but I will keep that discounted until it sells out.
[00:36:21.223 --> 00:36:22.444]  That may come before Monday.
[00:36:23.105 --> 00:36:26.207]  20% off our Methylcobalamin Pure Organic.
[00:36:26.767 --> 00:36:30.131]  Vitamin B12, that's so amazing, you take under the tongue.
[00:36:30.411 --> 00:36:38.659]  20% off winter sun, the vitamin D3, that I take also in the summer as well, but it's essential in the winter, because that's how you produce vitamin D mainly, is through the sun on your skin.
[00:36:39.039 --> 00:36:40.701]  Prostagard, an amazing formula.
[00:36:41.142 --> 00:36:41.682]  20% off.
[00:36:42.163 --> 00:36:44.945]  20% off Bio PCA for the skin and the nails.
[00:36:45.908 --> 00:36:46.689]  And so much more.
[00:36:47.089 --> 00:37:05.548]  Biome Defense, the 25 billion cultures per pill, amazing, game-changing, tip of the spear, very best out there from our years of research, from the top labs, of a nutraceutical that is absolutely critical as a probiotic in your life.
[00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.151]  Then, of course, we have Living Defense Parasite Cleanse.
[00:37:10.191 --> 00:37:11.211]  That's 20% off.
[00:37:11.711 --> 00:37:16.032]  We have DNA Force that's back in stock for a limited time and much, much more.
[00:37:16.072 --> 00:37:17.272]  There's a lot of other specials.
[00:37:17.612 --> 00:37:19.373]  A lot of items have free shipping as well.
[00:37:19.853 --> 00:37:23.774]  If you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off.
[00:37:24.094 --> 00:37:29.475]  You can sign up every month, every two months, every three months, every six months for it to automatically be shipped to you.

[00:37:33.576 --> 00:37:34.819]  You can cancel anytime.

[00:37:38.546 --> 00:37:41.793]  So this is total free will, free association.
[00:37:42.194 --> 00:37:43.216]  If you resonate...
[00:37:44.127 --> 00:37:50.753]  With our research, if you see how we're changing the world together, it's symbiotic, then get the high-quality nutraceuticals.

[00:38:06.886 --> 00:38:11.050]  But regardless of whether you financially support us or not, pray for us.
[00:38:12.546 --> 00:38:17.292]  Spread the word about InfoWars, because we can overcome the bots, the Google censors.
[00:38:17.732 --> 00:38:22.037]  We can overcome, with human ingenuity, their attempts to turn the U.S.
[00:38:22.097 --> 00:38:26.282]  and European Internet into something that resembles the Communist Chinese censored Internet.
[00:38:26.782 --> 00:38:28.364]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[00:38:28.464 --> 00:38:32.709]  Thank you to the crew that does such an amazing job during these marathon broadcasts.
[00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:38.013]  And thank you to everyone out there who is spreading the word, because what you're doing is changing the world.
[00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:42.776]  We've been growing, we've been changing the paradigm, we've been waking up millions of people.
[00:38:43.697 --> 00:38:54.524]  This is an animating contest of liberty, and you're about to see more reporters, more crew, new studios, more field reporters, more action, more victory against the globalists.
[00:38:55.004 --> 00:38:57.366]  Their ideology is twisted, evil, and weak.
[00:38:58.126 --> 00:39:00.868]  Our ideology is based in truth and honor and strength.
[00:39:01.269 --> 00:39:03.210]  And when good men and women of every color
[00:39:03.991 --> 00:39:12.340]  And every creed, take action, nothing on earth can stop human development and our long march to the stars in God's great plan.
[00:39:12.561 --> 00:39:18.387]  So for myself, Alex Jones, and the InfoWars family, I want to thank you, because you are family, and I want to
[00:39:19.048 --> 00:39:31.336]  Just again, thank God for all the blessings of creation and all the blessings of consciousness and my children and my family and the amazing tribulations and persecutions that God has carried me personally through.
[00:39:31.696 --> 00:39:32.797]  Thank you, God.
[00:39:33.277 --> 00:39:34.998]  Thank you for Christ, your Son.
[00:39:35.018 --> 00:39:36.919]  Thank you for the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.921]  Thank you for humbling yourself and becoming one of us.
[00:39:39.981 --> 00:39:43.143]  You can experience what we're going through at our level.
[00:39:43.484 --> 00:39:45.145]  And thank you for forgiving us.
[00:39:45.745 --> 00:39:50.889]  For the trespasses we've engaged in and not recognizing the incredible gift of consciousness you've given us.
[00:39:51.249 --> 00:39:52.790]  So, again, to God, thank you.
[00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.011]  To my family, thank you.
[00:39:54.171 --> 00:39:55.172]  To the listeners, thank you.
[00:39:55.352 --> 00:39:56.373]  And to my crew, thank you.
[00:39:56.733 --> 00:39:57.554]  I love you all.
[00:40:01.821 --> 00:40:04.142]  Alright, and that was Alex Jones, and we do thank you.
[00:40:04.182 --> 00:40:05.542]  We do appreciate your support.
[00:40:05.662 --> 00:40:17.286]  Thank you so much for supporting us through this time, and to give you an idea of the kind of insanity and opposition that we're facing, we're going to play something from Michael DeBerry in a moment, but before we do, I want to play a quick clip.
[00:40:17.746 --> 00:40:20.547]  This is an article we have up on Infowars.com.
[00:40:20.567 --> 00:40:23.988]  Lawrence Fishburne, you remember the actor who played
[00:40:25.307 --> 00:40:25.447]  In the
[00:40:40.247 --> 00:40:40.667]  Donald Trump.
[00:40:40.888 --> 00:40:44.711]  Her drunk driving arrest was the fault of Donald Trump.
[00:40:44.751 --> 00:40:55.762]  So let's play a short clip of this and you can see this in the comments on our article and I want to show you also what they're trying to do in terms of removing Trump when we come back.
[00:40:55.802 --> 00:41:02.248]  But let's take a quick look at Lawrence Fishburne's daughter blaming the political situation under Donald Trump for her DUI.
[00:41:03.271 --> 00:41:07.313]  I've been arrested before, and I have friends that are police officers.
[00:41:07.413 --> 00:41:08.114]  They just got hired.
[00:41:08.134 --> 00:41:08.354]  Okay.
[00:41:08.374 --> 00:41:24.483]  And not like that, but in the situation we are going through with Donald Trump, as a Latino American to another Latino American, I would appreciate if you can have me, show me the exercise correctly, so I can do it correctly.
[00:41:24.523 --> 00:41:24.763]  All right.
[00:41:25.785 --> 00:41:26.666]  There you go, yeah.
[00:41:26.846 --> 00:41:37.513]  And as part of that, it's a longer video which we don't show there because she's engaged in public urination, showing her bare behind in a Donald Trump rant.
[00:41:38.474 --> 00:41:44.118]  But you know, it's her entitlement because of this Nazi regime that we have going on.
[00:41:45.768 --> 00:41:52.073]  The other day, I was going back and forth between work, and I'm not sure which day it was because it's all kind of running together with this 30-hour marathon.
[00:41:52.453 --> 00:42:01.460]  We have a story up by Clifford Cunningham at Infowars.com talking about the secret conversations that are being held to impeach Donald Trump.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:06.483]  And as I was driving, like I said, I'm not sure which day it was, but I heard NPR talking about it.
[00:42:06.503 --> 00:42:08.745]  Of course, this individual, his name is
[00:42:10.146 --> 00:42:12.327]  Osnos is making grounds.
[00:42:12.387 --> 00:42:19.690]  He wrote an article on the New Yorker, he's going on MSNBC, he's going on NPR, Fresh Air, Terry Gross, all this stuff.
[00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:25.932]  All talking about how he's got all these experts who say that we're going to get Donald Trump impeached.
[00:42:26.392 --> 00:42:31.377]  He says he claims to have interviewed several dozen people about the prospects of cutting short Trump's presidency.
[00:42:31.778 --> 00:42:36.623]  He's talked to Trump's friends, advisors, to lawmakers, attorneys who have conducted impeachment.
[00:42:36.883 --> 00:42:40.006]  He's talked to physicians and historians because they're going to try to say he's crazy.
[00:42:40.266 --> 00:42:41.508]  Not this lady who is drunk.
[00:42:42.108 --> 00:42:43.109]  No, she's not crazy.
[00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:44.851]  Donald Trump is crazy.
[00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:56.022]  And they point out in this article, and this is something that's very important to remember when we start just, I mean, they're not saying, you know, we look at politicians, they say that person is crazy.
[00:42:56.042 --> 00:42:57.783]  I mean, they're really trying to convince you
[00:42:58.524 --> 00:43:00.185]  That he has mental illness.
[00:43:00.906 --> 00:43:18.258]  And they point out in this article, after Fact Magazine asked psychiatrists during the campaign of Barry Goldwater if he was psychologically fit to be president, they had a thousand of them say that he was warped, that he was impulsive, that he was paranoid and schizophrenic.
[00:43:18.939 --> 00:43:26.044]  You know how they smeared Barry Goldwater with that Daisy ad, the nuclear ad and everything, and so he successfully sued for libel,
[00:43:27.339 --> 00:43:31.483]  And we're going to go to Alex Jones in just a couple minutes.
[00:43:31.503 --> 00:43:34.305]  There's breaking news and we got Alex Jones coming in.
[00:43:34.485 --> 00:43:35.766]  Let me just finish this paragraph here.
[00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:38.348]  What happened with Goldwater?
[00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:40.410]  Was he sued them successfully for libel?
[00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:54.202]  And then in 1973, and we've had Dr. Pchenik talk about this because he's a psychiatrist, the American Psychiatric Association created the so-called Goldwater Rule, which forbade making a diagnosis without an in-person examination.
[00:43:55.606 --> 00:43:58.768]  And without permission to discuss their findings in public.
[00:43:59.108 --> 00:44:01.629]  So you have to actually do an examination.
[00:44:01.649 --> 00:44:06.852]  You know, not some kind of telepathic feeling that you get watching somebody on television.
[00:44:07.632 --> 00:44:10.733]  And you have to get your patient's permission to go public.
[00:44:11.114 --> 00:44:15.396]  So when we look at all this stuff, I think the key thing here, folks, is that they're
[00:44:16.158 --> 00:44:20.001]  There is a danger when we look at what's going on with his son-in-law, Kushner.
[00:44:20.782 --> 00:44:27.928]  And this loan, the failure to disclose loans that he got from George Soros, is not just a bad idea for his political base.
[00:44:28.528 --> 00:44:30.109]  It's not just an ethics issue.
[00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:36.575]  When you do something like that and you don't sign the paperwork, that is a very, very dangerous thing.
[00:44:37.335 --> 00:44:41.979]  And if Trump doesn't cut the ties to that, that could be used to impeach him.
[00:44:41.999 --> 00:44:43.020]  I think that's a very dangerous thing.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.760]  Let's go to Alex.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.721]  He's got breaking news.
[00:44:46.041 --> 00:44:46.261]  Alex?
[00:44:47.301 --> 00:44:47.921]  Absolutely, David.
[00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:49.021]  You're doing a fabulous job.
[00:44:49.041 --> 00:44:52.062]  I want to thank the crew that worked with everybody for the support in the last 48 hours.
[00:44:52.502 --> 00:44:56.963]  In the face of George Soros, who's found a law firm suing us, a member of the New York Tribal Reserves suing us.
[00:44:57.463 --> 00:45:01.304]  They're openly in the news, admittedly, trying to take us down right now, but we're only expanding in the face of it.
[00:45:01.904 --> 00:45:02.644]  But it's incredible.
[00:45:02.684 --> 00:45:06.965]  We're so zinked that this just broke on InfoWars.com ten minutes ago.
[00:45:07.565 --> 00:45:10.646]  And so I wanted to call in, and I asked him, I said, what's David covering?
[00:45:10.666 --> 00:45:12.086]  I know he's covering the Lawrence Fishburne thing.
[00:45:12.717 --> 00:45:15.879]  But by the time, which I'm glad you did, it's Gordon, Mark's sister's daughter.
[00:45:16.459 --> 00:45:18.761]  Totally delusional and not taking responsibility for herself.
[00:45:19.121 --> 00:45:21.383]  Peeing on the side of the road or whatever she was doing, her butt hanging out.
[00:45:22.323 --> 00:45:24.565]  I mean, obviously, if you're drunk, a woman's doing whatever.
[00:45:25.145 --> 00:45:29.348]  As soon as I go to you and I'm on hold for a couple of minutes, you're talking about what I called out about this.
[00:45:29.548 --> 00:45:35.412]  It's so ultra massive that we should have it as the top Facebook story, the top YouTube.
[00:45:35.892 --> 00:45:39.975]  We should really make a huge deal out of this because it's such a big deal.
[00:45:39.995 --> 00:45:41.996]  I'm going to actually be calm and not let myself get upset.
[00:45:43.186 --> 00:45:44.808]  I've studied how governments are taken down.
[00:45:45.528 --> 00:45:46.969]  I've studied how the government was operated.
[00:45:46.989 --> 00:45:51.833]  I've studied what they've done in more than 60 other countries that they've always found, sometimes repeatedly.
[00:45:52.314 --> 00:45:56.177]  Operation Ajax and Picky Trick in Iran, right through what happened with Kennedy in 63.
[00:45:56.277 --> 00:45:57.618]  It just goes on and on.
[00:45:58.199 --> 00:46:03.343]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have sources, but also more importantly than sources, I have history.
[00:46:03.984 --> 00:46:08.648]  And what David Knight was just covering, it's on Infowars.com, the Clifford Cunningham article.
[00:46:09.534 --> 00:46:13.416]  The New Yorker Magazine, one of the most elite publications where they communicate with each other.
[00:46:13.436 --> 00:46:15.958]  It's like a monthly with the Financial Times in London.
[00:46:17.658 --> 00:46:31.606]  In that publication, they're saying, oh, how we could fire again, not the people, but the globalists, the Republican establishment, the Democratic establishment, people that don't like the fact you killed TPP that was supposed to swallow our sovereignty, people that don't like
[00:46:32.529 --> 00:46:33.770]  He's getting the hell observed, actually.
[00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.791]  Make banks, make loans to small businesses.
[00:46:35.991 --> 00:46:39.674]  The fact that they don't want him to actually turn the economy on.
[00:46:39.694 --> 00:46:40.695]  He is a real president.
[00:46:40.775 --> 00:46:42.616]  He is trying to bring power back to America.
[00:46:42.976 --> 00:46:47.739]  He's doing some things that are impervious and compromises, but they will still try to destroy him because he is good.
[00:46:47.879 --> 00:46:48.700]  He is real.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.021]  He's irrevocably hurting political correctness.
[00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.323]  He's making us feel good about ourselves again.
[00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:55.304]  He's getting our morale up, the stock market, all of it.
[00:46:55.685 --> 00:46:58.286]  We were supposed to already be in a controlled global depression by now.
[00:46:58.306 --> 00:47:00.348]  They were going to bring in social unrest, you name it.
[00:47:01.002 --> 00:47:01.363]  I think so.
[00:47:16.292 --> 00:47:16.652]  I don't know.
[00:47:46.596 --> 00:47:51.459]  His own closest associates owe the families he threatened and everything.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.702]  And Ken Kushner's out of the control of Soros.
[00:47:55.382 --> 00:47:56.383]  And all the rest of it.
[00:47:56.483 --> 00:48:00.866]  And so they're saying, look, you destroy your father-in-law, or we're going to bring you down, basically.
[00:48:01.406 --> 00:48:02.907]  And so Trump is totally surrounded.
[00:48:03.748 --> 00:48:06.590]  In 106 days, they've already partially repealed Obamacare.
[00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.551]  They're devastating the globalist operation.
[00:48:09.151 --> 00:48:12.854]  Even though, let's say he's a battleship with 12 guns, maybe eight of them are firing right now.
[00:48:13.898 --> 00:48:16.440]  And as every month goes by, more of his guns get knocked out.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.602]  But still, still, we're taking them down at the same time.
[00:48:19.622 --> 00:48:24.906]  It's like a video game at the end of a level where you're fighting the boss, and your energy's going down, but his energy's going down.
[00:48:25.386 --> 00:48:26.807]  We are bleeding the globalists out.
[00:48:26.827 --> 00:48:27.868]  LePen's set to win.
[00:48:27.888 --> 00:48:30.190]  Unless we're hanky-panky.
[00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.711]  Nationalism's turbo-surging.
[00:48:31.731 --> 00:48:37.535]  So they're attacking LePen, the Infowars, Trump, Nigel Farage, who tried to kill him three times.
[00:48:38.169 --> 00:48:41.251]  That was off the record when the news came out.
[00:48:41.271 --> 00:48:43.293]  I can report it, but he definitely knows they're trying to kill him.
[00:48:43.313 --> 00:48:44.714]  He's been told, retire your dad.
[00:48:45.114 --> 00:48:45.975]  Well, he retired.
[00:48:45.995 --> 00:48:50.359]  They would actually follow their promise to make England sovereign again, but they didn't.
[00:48:50.399 --> 00:48:50.959]  They backed off.
[00:48:51.379 --> 00:48:53.981]  So he's getting ready to run for prime minister, even though they've said you're a dead man.
[00:48:54.342 --> 00:48:55.362]  So he has incredible courage.
[00:48:55.643 --> 00:48:57.884]  I've obviously been told the same things by very serious people.
[00:48:58.385 --> 00:48:59.826]  So folks, as I said, this isn't a game.
[00:49:00.486 --> 00:49:02.328]  Trump is in an arena death battle.
[00:49:02.978 --> 00:49:04.680]  I've used that term gas struggle, death and battle.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.062]  A lot of Democrats use it because that is what this is.
[00:49:07.102 --> 00:49:07.923]  This is no quarter.
[00:49:08.664 --> 00:49:10.325]  We're not giving them quarter.
[00:49:10.345 --> 00:49:12.387]  We just want to restore the Republic of prosperity.
[00:49:12.748 --> 00:49:22.417]  They want a North Korea meets THX 1138 model and everybody other than claims they're liberal or conservative should realize these fake fights between Democrats and Republicans
[00:49:23.729 --> 00:49:24.929]  Our total and complete theater.
[00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:26.090]  They're not real.
[00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:31.611]  When you see real attacks, though, on Trump, and all these attempts to promote killing him and stuff, that's because he is real.
[00:49:32.151 --> 00:49:32.831]  He is real.
[00:49:33.092 --> 00:49:34.512]  I've got a crew of 65 people.
[00:49:34.632 --> 00:49:37.233]  They're all great people, but still, we have problems.
[00:49:37.293 --> 00:49:39.873]  Directors get messed up.
[00:49:40.013 --> 00:49:41.134]  A lot of it's my fault.
[00:49:41.154 --> 00:49:45.935]  Imagine having 4,000 people under you, and then you're interfaced with over 2 million federal employees.
[00:49:46.667 --> 00:49:51.048]  And then millions and millions of contractors and major corporations, they're doing whatever they want.
[00:49:51.508 --> 00:49:52.388]  They're running rampant.
[00:49:53.028 --> 00:49:53.608]  They're arrogant.
[00:49:53.628 --> 00:49:54.609]  They're sabotaging you.
[00:49:54.669 --> 00:50:03.230]  And now that they are openly in, now that they are openly in the New Yorker magazine saying, behind the scenes, they're looking at his overthrow, not just his impeachment.
[00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.391]  And they're talking about using COG, even if they don't have the votes.
[00:50:06.431 --> 00:50:12.152]  They are trying to get people ready and lined up to normalize this in the bureaucracy for an assassination.
[00:50:13.258 --> 00:50:15.599]  Uh, or for an overthrow, or you name it.
[00:50:15.639 --> 00:50:22.660]  And believe me, the Democrats and Republican leadership aside, they're gonna call everyone Russians who got elected from the, uh, Freedom Caucus.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.141]  And the Republican Freedom Caucus are a great people, by the way.
[00:50:26.621 --> 00:50:30.702]  Some of them are war mongers, but other than that, when it comes to sovereignty, Second Amendment, they're good people.
[00:50:30.862 --> 00:50:32.702]  They're misguided in some cases, but they're good people.
[00:50:33.302 --> 00:50:33.942]  They're Americans.
[00:50:33.962 --> 00:50:37.243]  They're not perfect, but they're, you know, they want prosperity, they're not evil, okay?
[00:50:38.047 --> 00:50:39.247]  They are the key to this.
[00:50:39.287 --> 00:50:41.608]  They've got to understand they're going to be next if this happens.
[00:50:42.168 --> 00:50:43.689]  And I'm just telling you, it's going to be so strong.
[00:50:43.729 --> 00:50:44.849]  I've known this in my gut for months.
[00:50:45.269 --> 00:50:46.730]  And stuff Trump does makes me mad.
[00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:51.832]  But it's his adjuncts just speaking out of turn, McMaster and the rest of them doing whatever they want.
[00:50:52.792 --> 00:50:56.753]  You know, saying arrest the sons and stuff to destroy Trump's base and his support.
[00:50:57.073 --> 00:51:00.014]  I know from insider, very high up, that he is disgusted.
[00:51:00.054 --> 00:51:00.935]  He is sick of it.
[00:51:00.955 --> 00:51:02.395]  They've demoralized him, which
[00:51:03.115 --> 00:51:05.817]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:51:06.017 --> 00:51:09.099]  That communist Chinese-style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.180]  Because it's already here.
[00:51:10.561 --> 00:51:11.221]  It's being announced.
[00:51:11.581 --> 00:51:15.044]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:51:15.464 --> 00:51:17.385]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:51:17.505 --> 00:51:19.067]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:51:19.247 --> 00:51:20.287]  InfoWars Live.
[00:51:20.448 --> 00:51:21.268]  Available right now.
[00:51:21.548 --> 00:51:22.889]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.731]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:51:26.372 --> 00:51:27.353]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[00:51:27.893 --> 00:51:30.915]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:51:31.395 --> 00:51:31.976]  Take action!
[00:51:39.631 --> 00:51:41.492]  InfoWars wouldn't exist without you.
[00:51:41.592 --> 00:51:42.852]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:51:43.052 --> 00:51:50.276]  During that 30-plus hour live transmission that kicked off Wednesday and ran right through Thursday, we saw massive, massive support.
[00:51:50.576 --> 00:51:54.017]  Spreading the word, spreading the articles, and our free newsletters.
[00:51:54.057 --> 00:51:55.118]  We can stay in contact.
[00:51:55.198 --> 00:51:55.898]  It's been amazing.
[00:51:56.078 --> 00:52:03.964]  That's why I'm going to go ahead and extend some of the biggest sales we've had in six months right through this weekend, right through until Monday morning.

[00:52:50.023 --> 00:52:52.544]  20% off Bio PCA for the skin and the nails.

[00:52:56.166 --> 00:52:58.528]  The 25 billion cultures per pill.
[00:52:59.208 --> 00:52:59.788]  Amazing.
[00:52:59.868 --> 00:53:00.629]  Game-changing.
[00:53:00.709 --> 00:53:01.489]  Tip of the spear.
[00:53:01.989 --> 00:53:05.091]  Very best out there from our years of research from the top labs.
[00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:08.232]  Then of course we have Living Defense Parasite Cleanse.
[00:53:08.272 --> 00:53:08.532]  That's 20% off.
[00:53:09.793 --> 00:53:14.118]  We have DNA Force that's back in stock for a limited time, and much, much more.
[00:53:14.158 --> 00:53:15.379]  There's a lot of other specials.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:22.888]  It's all there at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or you can call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:53:22.928 --> 00:53:27.934]  So for myself, Alex Jones, and the InfoWars family, I want to thank you, because you are family.
[00:53:32.853 --> 00:53:34.734]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:53:34.794 --> 00:53:36.676]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:53:36.756 --> 00:53:39.477]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:53:39.677 --> 00:53:40.498]  Alex Jones.
[00:53:40.578 --> 00:53:43.340]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.602]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:53:46.622 --> 00:53:47.943]  Deeply I think racist.
[00:53:48.043 --> 00:53:49.884]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:53:50.004 --> 00:53:51.825]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:53:52.626 --> 00:53:55.908]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:53:55.928 --> 00:53:57.089]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:57.149 --> 00:54:02.052]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:17.473]  No, I mean, I'm taking care of very serious families right now.
[00:54:17.513 --> 00:54:18.513]  I'm actually coming today.
[00:54:18.533 --> 00:54:27.077]  David's doing an incredible job, but they get us conditioned to just accept incredible tyranny in our faces like it's no big deal.
[00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:28.078]  This is done.
[00:54:28.118 --> 00:54:30.719]  This is done over and over and over and over again.
[00:54:31.379 --> 00:54:32.700]  So we even have ultra massive
[00:54:33.533 --> 00:54:37.856]  Crime taking place by the globalists, and then myself, everybody else, we just kind of halfway accept it.
[00:54:38.376 --> 00:54:45.940]  The reason we've been so successful against him is I do raise the alarm, David raises the alarm, and we really get upset about what's going on, and don't just go quietly into the night.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.382]  But here's the headline of the whole show today, and the whole theme.
[00:54:48.822 --> 00:54:54.345]  I hope the listeners will really get the word out about Clifford Cunningham's article, which is excellent, but it's very dry.
[00:54:54.365 --> 00:55:02.050]  It's kind of like reporting, you know, that Hitler invaded France or something in 1941, and we all just kind of sit here and, you know, go to sleep.
[00:55:02.913 --> 00:55:06.336]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not criticizing Cunningham, I'm just saying he'd rather report it as he should.
[00:55:06.356 --> 00:55:10.158]  The New Yorker magazine, the elites, admit they're in Congress, they're everywhere.
[00:55:10.579 --> 00:55:12.260]  This is the shadow government coming out.
[00:55:13.354 --> 00:55:22.740]  And announcing plans to overthrow the president, the elected president, and they're saying it like it's no big deal, like it's, you know, going in and getting your tooth drilled on for a root canal or something.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.960]  It's all very routine.
[00:55:24.261 --> 00:55:25.141]  It's all no big deal.
[00:55:25.181 --> 00:55:25.842]  Nothing to see here.
[00:55:25.862 --> 00:55:26.302]  Go away.
[00:55:26.722 --> 00:55:30.004]  Because they are pissed he's returning, returning the sovereignty.
[00:55:30.244 --> 00:55:34.947]  They are so upset that this has really happened, that the power is being taken away from them.
[00:55:35.167 --> 00:55:36.848]  You can say he's doing some things that aren't perfect.
[00:55:36.888 --> 00:55:37.809]  That doesn't even really matter.
[00:55:38.439 --> 00:55:40.440]  The power is being taken away from the globalists.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.022]  It is being transferred back to the executive, the legislative, the judicial.
[00:55:44.322 --> 00:55:45.903]  It's being transferred back to the states.
[00:55:46.363 --> 00:55:48.324]  We drain the swamp, one city, one county.
[00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:52.114]  One family, one company, one church at a time.
[00:55:52.594 --> 00:56:00.399]  And so, uh, David's doing an awesome job here today breaking this down, but I would just ask all our guests and everything else we have coming up, just be front and center.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:07.024]  And then all of my writers write more articles about this because I've got probably 20 special reports that are on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:07.324 --> 00:56:11.186]  We're going to repost and cutting him's article where I said, COG is coming.
[00:56:11.547 --> 00:56:13.548]  They're organizing a coup behind the scenes of Congress.
[00:56:13.908 --> 00:56:15.849]  They're organizing at the Pentagon from my sources.
[00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:18.011]  Didn't get the former deputy head of the treasury.
[00:56:18.655 --> 00:56:19.056]  Come out.
[00:56:19.517 --> 00:56:23.845]  And all these other people and deputy heads of the Justice Department admit that there's plans to overthrow Trump.
[00:56:24.066 --> 00:56:26.992]  And they're shopping the overthrow of an elected president.
[00:56:27.032 --> 00:56:28.434]  Folks, this is martial law.
[00:56:29.614 --> 00:56:32.516]  By another name, that they're now selling publicly.
[00:56:32.556 --> 00:56:35.638]  This isn't Alex three months ago saying it, or David saying it three months ago.
[00:56:35.718 --> 00:56:36.759]  It's happening now.
[00:56:37.139 --> 00:56:40.121]  We need everybody to get this article out everywhere.
[00:56:40.141 --> 00:56:42.483]  The president is in danger, and all of us are in danger.
[00:56:42.523 --> 00:56:43.164]  Let me just say this.
[00:56:43.664 --> 00:56:45.485]  We're so busy, I didn't have a plug once this hour.
[00:56:45.926 --> 00:56:49.248]  We did some visa fundraising yesterday, but I need to get more reporters, more crew, fast.
[00:56:49.628 --> 00:56:52.370]  We've got all our nuclear cylinders on sale, 30-20% off.
[00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:55.492]  Water filter's off 30%, with the ProPure team.
[00:56:56.393 --> 00:56:57.594]  A lot of that stuff's gonna sell out.
[00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:59.075]  That sale has to end this weekend.
[00:56:59.907 --> 00:57:02.249]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a fellow Reserve Board of New York signing us, okay?
[00:57:02.269 --> 00:57:04.331]  I mean, we have a board member.
[00:57:04.351 --> 00:57:05.352]  We are under Globalist.
[00:57:05.772 --> 00:57:07.174]  Sustained George Soros attack.
[00:57:07.995 --> 00:57:08.695]  And it's okay.
[00:57:08.756 --> 00:57:09.276]  We're winning.
[00:57:09.356 --> 00:57:10.617]  We're the American Resistance.
[00:57:10.697 --> 00:57:11.637]  You're the American Resistance.
[00:57:11.697 --> 00:57:12.358]  We're fighting.
[00:57:12.818 --> 00:57:14.399]  People have to realize how real this is.
[00:57:14.419 --> 00:57:18.221]  That's why the enemy is out there saying in the news, I voted for Obama with no proof.
[00:57:18.261 --> 00:57:18.761]  Total crap.
[00:57:18.801 --> 00:57:20.082]  They're saying I'm not real.
[00:57:20.102 --> 00:57:20.922]  Of course I'm real.
[00:57:21.103 --> 00:57:21.903]  This is all real.
[00:57:22.203 --> 00:57:23.104]  We're changing the world.
[00:57:23.144 --> 00:57:24.505]  It's because we are so real.
[00:57:24.785 --> 00:57:25.845]  We are so 100% real.
[00:57:25.885 --> 00:57:27.666]  But the globalists can't stand that.
[00:57:28.067 --> 00:57:29.687]  So we need your prayers more than anything.
[00:57:29.788 --> 00:57:31.088]  I'm praying for you and us together.
[00:57:31.288 --> 00:57:32.549]  I need your financial support.
[00:57:32.749 --> 00:57:33.890]  I need you to get around the bots.
[00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.791]  It's critical for Cunningham's powerful article.
[00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:36.331]  I think so.
[00:57:53.285 --> 00:57:53.725]  We're good to go.
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:13.940]  Alright, stay with us.

[00:59:54.065 --> 01:00:00.029]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:05.812]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:05.992 --> 01:00:10.055]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:22.714 --> 01:00:23.975]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:24.056 --> 01:00:31.264]  I'm David Knight and we're going to take a look at the House plan and the process ahead of us because we've still got to get through the Senate.
[01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:34.129]  And the Senate says, well, we're going to write our own bill.
[01:00:34.149 --> 01:00:35.630]  We're not really going to pay any attention to that.
[01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:39.895]  I think they're going to take a look at it, but then there are senators on both sides.
[01:00:39.955 --> 01:00:45.622]  Of course, when CNN looks at the seven Republican senators, they say we need to watch on this health care bill.
[01:00:46.202 --> 01:00:51.869]  They look at the liberal ones, like Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Rob Portman.
[01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:53.851]  This is true, folks.
[01:00:54.311 --> 01:00:58.774]  CNN says, each of these less ideologically driven senators have voiced concerns.
[01:00:58.894 --> 01:00:59.254]  No, no.
[01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:05.619]  These liberal senators, these liberal Republicans who are to the left of many Democrats.
[01:01:05.859 --> 01:01:07.640]  Oh, they're not ideological at all.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.842]  See, that's the same thing we see happening in France.
[01:01:10.728 --> 01:01:31.557]  They always talk about Macron as being centrist, and he is moderate, and anybody who takes a globalist establishment approach, whether they're Republicans here in this country, or whether they're globalists abroad in France, the mainstream media always calls them centrists, they call them moderates, the Republicans who are opposing
[01:01:32.097 --> 01:01:36.819]  Any changes at all to Obamacare were always talked about as being centrists and moderates.
[01:01:37.379 --> 01:01:40.860]  They never call them hardline socialists.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:46.502]  They never call them socialist extremists, okay, or globalist extremists.
[01:01:46.522 --> 01:01:51.203]  They never use the words extremism unless they say far-right.
[01:01:51.303 --> 01:01:52.364]  They never call these people
[01:01:52.904 --> 01:01:57.052]  Far left globalists, or extreme globalists.
[01:01:57.072 --> 01:01:58.595]  They never use those types of languages.
[01:01:58.735 --> 01:02:02.282]  We're also going to take a look at some of the back and forth that's going on in France.
[01:02:02.322 --> 01:02:03.224]  It's actually kind of funny.
[01:02:04.364 --> 01:02:05.164]  The rhetoric going on there.
[01:02:05.184 --> 01:02:09.866]  But I want to stay focused in this segment on the article that we were just talking about.
[01:02:09.906 --> 01:02:10.926]  I was talking about it.
[01:02:10.986 --> 01:02:11.846]  Alex talked about it.
[01:02:12.526 --> 01:02:14.007]  It's at Infowars.com.
[01:02:14.667 --> 01:02:18.728]  Congress is holding quote-unquote secret conversations about removing Trump.
[01:02:18.828 --> 01:02:20.249]  This is by Clifford Cunningham.
[01:02:20.609 --> 01:02:25.030]  And of course it focuses on the New Yorker magazine article written by a man named Osnos.
[01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:31.212]  And he's been making the liberal talk radio circuit going on MSNBC, going on NPR.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:36.463]  And as I was reading from the article saying, understand what they did to Barry Goldwater in 1964.
[01:02:37.083 --> 01:02:44.228]  You know that they smeared him as a crazy Doctor Strange love character with his finger on the nuclear button.
[01:02:44.408 --> 01:02:47.651]  They had the Daisy ad that aired only once.
[01:02:48.769 --> 01:02:54.891]  And then the media kept running it over and over again, implying that he was going to put us into war.
[01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:56.051]  What did LBJ do?
[01:02:56.291 --> 01:03:01.612]  He escalated Vietnam, had absolutely no management of it whatsoever.
[01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:04.653]  He was a very dangerous, warmongering demagogue.
[01:03:04.713 --> 01:03:10.335]  But of course, Goldwater, who was really grounded, he was rational, and he was principled,
[01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:13.176]  But he just wasn't a globalist, okay?
[01:03:13.216 --> 01:03:15.117]  They did everything they could to destroy him.
[01:03:15.717 --> 01:03:22.159]  And so what they did back in 1964, they had a magazine go out and had a thousand psychiatrists call him warped, impulsive, paranoid, schizophrenic.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:33.964]  He successfully sued them for libel and nine years later, the American Psychiatric Association came up with the Goldwater Rule that said that you're not going to make a diagnosis from afar
[01:03:34.904 --> 01:03:38.066]  And you're not going to talk about it even if this person is your patient.
[01:03:38.226 --> 01:03:40.227]  You're not going to diagnose people who aren't your patient.
[01:03:41.087 --> 01:03:43.228]  That you're going to diagnose over the television, okay?
[01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:49.712]  And if they are your patient, you're going to have to exercise doctor-patient privileges.
[01:03:49.732 --> 01:03:52.173]  You're going to have to get their permission to talk about it in public.
[01:03:52.193 --> 01:03:53.593]  Well, they did it a thousand times.
[01:03:53.634 --> 01:04:01.698]  Had a thousand psychiatrists smear Barry Goldwater because first they have to destroy your character so they can destroy you.
[01:04:01.898 --> 01:04:04.259]  Or assassinate your character so they can assassinate you.
[01:04:05.305 --> 01:04:09.829]  And they've done it now with Donald Trump more than 50,000 times.
[01:04:09.909 --> 01:04:14.554]  So 50 times the number of people out there smearing Donald Trump with this.
[01:04:14.614 --> 01:04:19.258]  Signing a petition saying that he's too mentally ill to perform the duties of the presidency.
[01:04:19.278 --> 01:04:24.583]  And then we have Democrat Senator Mark Warner of Virginia quoted by Osnos and others saying that
[01:04:25.544 --> 01:04:37.391]  This is a guy who is the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee hearing, intelligence committee I should say, privately told his friends that he puts the odds at 2 to 1 against Trump completing a full term.
[01:04:37.992 --> 01:04:47.298]  And Bill Kristol, the always never Trumper, even after Donald Trump shot the missiles into Syria, and we had other people with his publication,
[01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:50.739]  Like Elliot Abrams come out say he's finally president.
[01:04:51.039 --> 01:04:54.339]  Bill Kristol says no, I think there's a pretty good chance He's gonna get impeached.
[01:04:54.419 --> 01:05:02.281]  They are going to stab him in the back They say he cannot trust these establishment globalists never Trump or neocons.
[01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:17.224]  We'll be right back Talk to Gerald Salenti the founder and editor of Trends Research Journal and also Trends Research Institute, so I want to talk to Gerald about how he sees
[01:05:18.391 --> 01:05:28.536]  Things going economically, but also the war and peace issues, because we're now seeing that Donald Trump talked to the UN National Security Council yesterday at the White House.
[01:05:29.277 --> 01:05:36.000]  He'll be meeting, I think it's today, with all 100 senators from within the White House.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.662]  Again, talking about the North Korean situation.
[01:05:39.422 --> 01:05:41.663]  And, Gerald, let's get your comments on that.
[01:05:42.283 --> 01:05:42.524]  Are you...
[01:05:43.684 --> 01:05:48.912]  Optimistic about this working out peacefully, or do you think this is something that they're pushing for war?
[01:05:50.034 --> 01:05:53.078]  I've been hearing about North Korea just about all my life.
[01:05:53.098 --> 01:05:55.362]  I mean, this is a poor country.
[01:05:55.382 --> 01:05:57.645]  I mean, this is a country of nothing.
[01:05:58.348 --> 01:05:58.548]  Yeah.
[01:05:58.868 --> 01:06:03.451]  So, what this is, it's more war propaganda.
[01:06:04.011 --> 01:06:16.557]  It's what Eisenhower warned us of, that the military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[01:06:16.577 --> 01:06:24.561]  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.
[01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:35.314]  And when I listen to this guy that's in charge of the Defense Department, James, quote, Mad Dog Mattis, what adult would call himself Mad Dog?
[01:06:35.974 --> 01:06:38.476]  And I hear the words that they're speaking.
[01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:42.110]  Actually, it's a lot of fun to fight them, you know?
[01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:44.731]  It's a hell of a hoot.
[01:06:44.791 --> 01:06:46.052]  It's fun to shoot some people.
[01:06:46.092 --> 01:06:46.852]  I'll be right up on you.
[01:06:46.872 --> 01:06:47.572]  I like brawling.
[01:06:48.152 --> 01:06:59.717]  And Gerald, we've just seen the Russians as well as the Chinese move massive amounts of military to the border that they have with North Korea because they're concerned about a massive flood of refugees.
[01:07:00.077 --> 01:07:00.938]  Coming into their country.
[01:07:01.078 --> 01:07:09.243]  If there is an economic meltdown from the sanctions or if there is a war, they know they can't absorb massive amounts of refugees.
[01:07:09.344 --> 01:07:10.524]  No country can.
[01:07:10.725 --> 01:07:11.925]  It isn't a racist thing.
[01:07:12.306 --> 01:07:16.108]  It isn't that the Chinese are racist against the North Koreans or the Russians are racist against them.
[01:07:16.328 --> 01:07:17.189]  You simply can't do it.
[01:07:17.289 --> 01:07:18.550]  That's the way you destroy a country.
[01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:21.352]  So they have positioned their troops there at the border.
[01:07:21.372 --> 01:07:26.896]  Of course, we don't have troops to protect our borders because we're abroad fighting wars everywhere, aren't we?
[01:07:27.356 --> 01:07:31.100]  It's not racist if you don't want refugees.
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.722]  Go back to the Great Depression.
[01:07:34.723 --> 01:07:40.749]  I mentioned how bad this country is doing for we, the little people, who have to work for a living.
[01:07:41.369 --> 01:07:42.570]  When the Depression hit,
[01:07:43.271 --> 01:07:49.593]  They stopped everybody from coming in until the country rebuilt itself.
[01:07:49.993 --> 01:07:51.053]  We have 220, 320 million people.
[01:07:51.073 --> 01:07:52.654]  We can't take care of our own.
[01:07:52.674 --> 01:07:53.054]  I got a great idea.
[01:07:53.074 --> 01:07:54.634]  Let's bring in another 100 million.
[01:08:14.238 --> 01:08:17.042]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:29.401 --> 01:08:30.683]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:30.743 --> 01:08:33.266]  I'm David Knight and joining me now is Leanne McAdoo.
[01:08:33.306 --> 01:08:35.229]  We have an article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:35.629 --> 01:08:41.277]  New York Times smears Le Pen and French patriots as racist extremists.
[01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:44.141]  And of course we had a very interesting debate the other night.
[01:08:44.201 --> 01:08:46.103]  The election is going to be on Sunday.
[01:08:46.924 --> 01:08:48.766]  And we talked about this a little bit yesterday.
[01:08:48.786 --> 01:08:52.408]  Breitbart had a story, Macron's deplorables moment.
[01:08:52.468 --> 01:08:58.033]  And as I said, it's really probably more of a Les Miserables, you know, where he's calling them hateful cowards.
[01:08:58.093 --> 01:08:59.173]  He's going all this stuff.
[01:08:59.434 --> 01:09:01.395]  And it kind of reminded me, we read these insults.
[01:09:02.016 --> 01:09:05.458]  It's kind of like Monty Python's Holy Grail, if you remember where they go up and...
[01:09:07.445 --> 01:09:12.008]  Do a siege on the French castle, and the French guy comes out and taunts them.
[01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:16.572]  So, look at this macaron, the taunts that he has out here.
[01:09:16.592 --> 01:09:19.514]  It's almost like, you stupid nationalist types!
[01:09:20.234 --> 01:09:21.755]  I fart in your general direction.
[01:09:21.795 --> 01:09:22.776]  He goes, they're here!
[01:09:22.796 --> 01:09:26.779]  It's they, it's they who are true enemies, these nationalists.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:33.905]  They are powerful, organized, skillful, determined, you pass them in the streets, the countryside, the web, most often well hidden.
[01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:35.206]  Hateful!
[01:09:35.386 --> 01:09:36.247]  Cowardly!
[01:09:36.467 --> 01:09:37.127]  You know them!
[01:09:37.948 --> 01:09:44.694]  The party of the agents of disaster, fear mongers, the French far right, it's here!
[01:09:45.094 --> 01:09:58.505]  They use anger, they propagate lies, for decades they have fanned hatred, fomented divisions, imposed their discourse of discrimination, so then the hurling of the livestock begins.
[01:09:59.806 --> 01:10:01.508]  That was the French debate, okay?
[01:10:01.908 --> 01:10:05.732]  Very much like the Monty Python sieging of the castle.
[01:10:06.372 --> 01:10:09.775]  Marine Le Pen came back and had a great reply.
[01:10:09.875 --> 01:10:14.159]  She said, the reality is, you went to see Merkel.
[01:10:14.179 --> 01:10:16.601]  They're bringing out the cows to throw.
[01:10:16.941 --> 01:10:19.223]  You went to, and here's where she throws her cow, okay?
[01:10:19.263 --> 01:10:21.825]  She says, the reality is, you went to see Merkel.
[01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:28.878]  And you asked for her blessing because you plan to do nothing without her agreement.
[01:10:28.899 --> 01:10:32.003]  And it goes, well of course I want France to measure up to Germany.
[01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:33.925]  She said, let me tell you what happened.
[01:10:34.486 --> 01:10:36.468]  France will be led by a woman.
[01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:39.212]  It'll be either me or it'll be Ms.
[01:10:39.312 --> 01:10:39.592]  Merkel.
[01:10:40.894 --> 01:10:41.694]  And that's the truth.
[01:10:41.975 --> 01:10:42.875]  And that is the truth.
[01:10:43.195 --> 01:10:44.536]  He is a globalist.
[01:10:44.756 --> 01:10:46.036]  He is a globalist puppet.
[01:10:46.317 --> 01:10:49.158]  This is a guy who is a Rothschild banker.
[01:10:49.198 --> 01:10:51.019]  It's pretty amazing, really, when you look at it.
[01:10:51.119 --> 01:10:59.663]  This guy does some... He buys his way out of a government obligation to do some service there.
[01:11:00.263 --> 01:11:03.104]  And he goes to work for the Rothschilds for a couple of years.
[01:11:03.164 --> 01:11:04.565]  Comes back fabulously wealthy.
[01:11:04.605 --> 01:11:06.546]  They put him in a socialist regime.
[01:11:07.206 --> 01:11:16.456]  And what he does there is he destroys the popularity of Hollande, the guy who did not run for re-election, first time a French socialist has not run for re-election.
[01:11:16.496 --> 01:11:23.203]  He destroyed his credibility because he implemented austerity programs from a French socialist perspective.
[01:11:23.243 --> 01:11:28.628]  It was a socialist party that was in power and they hired this Rothschild banker and he implemented
[01:11:29.309 --> 01:11:38.153]  These EU austerity programs that were antithetical to what the Socialist Party was about, that's why there was a split in the Socialist Party.
[01:11:38.593 --> 01:11:41.855]  That's why you had that one guy that rapidly rose up.
[01:11:42.864 --> 01:11:43.924]  Finished third or fourth.
[01:11:44.525 --> 01:11:46.366]  The first four people are very closely tied.
[01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:53.129]  He's now thrown his support behind Marine Le Pen, because he is not for the European Union.
[01:11:53.329 --> 01:11:55.830]  He wants to have these decisions decided in France.
[01:11:55.870 --> 01:12:01.212]  So this is really split the Socialist Party, bringing this banker into the Socialist Party.
[01:12:01.232 --> 01:12:04.534]  And of course, he quit so that he could run for president.
[01:12:04.714 --> 01:12:09.516]  And his party is called En Marche, or just move on, if you will.
[01:12:10.856 --> 01:12:17.201]  It's the youth, the Soros people, it's the same pattern we see in every one of these countries.
[01:12:17.481 --> 01:12:20.162]  The Soros organizations coming in there, march on.
[01:12:20.363 --> 01:12:26.407]  Right, and then Hillary Clinton is of course creating another anti-Trump group and it's going to be called Onward Together.
[01:12:26.447 --> 01:12:28.168]  So this is the thing, it's like, let's move on.
[01:12:28.188 --> 01:12:32.831]  And it's like, I wish you would move on and go back to the little rock that you crawled from under.
[01:12:32.931 --> 01:12:34.612]  Or at least come back with a different slogan.
[01:12:35.412 --> 01:12:41.314]  Well, it just kind of shows you how globally they're all colluding together to move on and onward together.
[01:12:41.334 --> 01:12:50.398]  But it's just incredible how the actual fake news is that they are trying to paint this guy as the outsider when he is totally an insider.
[01:12:50.478 --> 01:12:51.178]  He's a globalist.
[01:12:51.198 --> 01:12:52.118]  He was put in there.
[01:12:52.879 --> 01:12:56.520]  And what we're seeing in the in the last debate that they had,
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:06.403]  Uh, where Le Pen kind of gave him a little jab and she said, well, you know, I'd hate to find out that you have some offshore account in the Bahamas where you're evading taxes.
[01:13:07.003 --> 01:13:11.645]  And so now he, uh, Macron is actually suing Le Pen over these Kremlin smears.
[01:13:11.725 --> 01:13:13.626]  Where have we heard all of this before?
[01:13:13.906 --> 01:13:14.086]  Yeah.
[01:13:14.406 --> 01:13:19.450]  They're all onward together with the Russian agents and Russian election interference.
[01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:25.554]  But he's basically suing her, accusing her of smearing him with these fake claims of tax evasion.
[01:13:26.195 --> 01:13:30.718]  Meanwhile, the French media refuses to report on anything or doing any digging.
[01:13:31.399 --> 01:13:36.783]  And 4chan is actually posting images from Macron's offshore bank account, allegedly.
[01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:40.606]  And these images show this LLC operating agreement.
[01:13:41.346 --> 01:13:42.206]  It's not in the Bahamas.
[01:13:42.306 --> 01:13:43.527]  It's in the Cayman Islands.
[01:13:43.607 --> 01:13:44.187]  Oh, there you go.
[01:13:44.207 --> 01:13:45.127]  See, it was fake news.
[01:13:45.747 --> 01:13:48.188]  He doesn't have an offshore account in the Bahamas.
[01:13:48.568 --> 01:13:50.168]  It's in the Cayman Islands.
[01:13:50.328 --> 01:13:50.568]  Right.
[01:13:50.648 --> 01:13:51.769]  Because they cut him a better deal.
[01:13:52.009 --> 01:13:52.209]  Right.
[01:13:52.389 --> 01:13:53.849]  And so that's just, that's sort of the thing.
[01:13:53.869 --> 01:13:56.510]  But we're not going to hear about this in the French media.
[01:13:56.590 --> 01:14:00.611]  As Watson's been pointing out, you see all the magazines on all the newsstands.
[01:14:00.971 --> 01:14:02.851]  It's all Macron and he's just handsome.
[01:14:02.911 --> 01:14:05.832]  And some of, he has his shirt off and you can see his six pack.
[01:14:06.452 --> 01:14:08.634]  And it's like obvious what they're trying to do there.
[01:14:09.074 --> 01:14:12.117]  It's almost like putting Hillary Clinton in all the halo photos.
[01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:15.199]  Well just look at the headlines from AFP after the debate.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:19.443]  Macron convinces the majority of French viewers on the TV.
[01:14:19.463 --> 01:14:20.524]  In other words, he's the winner.
[01:14:20.624 --> 01:14:21.464]  He's convinced us.
[01:14:21.805 --> 01:14:22.665]  Haven't you been convinced?
[01:14:22.946 --> 01:14:24.267]  That's what they do with their push polling.
[01:14:24.567 --> 01:14:30.031]  They tell everybody that he won the debate and people want him to win the election and so forth and so on.
[01:14:30.051 --> 01:14:30.972]  They're saying that he's ahead 60-40.
[01:14:32.273 --> 01:14:38.917]  But then we have these other articles where you have people saying, wait a minute, are we going to make the same mistake we did with the American election?
[01:14:39.397 --> 01:14:48.562]  Are we going to ignore the fact that there's an energized base here that is going to show up that hasn't showed up in previous elections that maybe we're not even polling?
[01:14:48.643 --> 01:14:59.409]  Remember when some people in the Democrat Party said, yeah, you know, the problem is we didn't even poll rural white America because we didn't think they were relevant anymore.
[01:14:59.429 --> 01:14:59.789]  Right.
[01:14:59.989 --> 01:15:01.992]  And so that's one of the things that's happening here.
[01:15:02.072 --> 01:15:10.744]  So there's a lot of, there isn't any enthusiasm for Macron and there is a lot of enthusiasm for Marine Le Pen and the rural areas.
[01:15:10.884 --> 01:15:16.151]  It is breaking down very much like we see here in America and there's a reason for that, folks.
[01:15:16.832 --> 01:15:23.457]  You know, we have a very different culture from the French people, and we're not going to be promoting the kind of French word, laissez-faire.
[01:15:24.097 --> 01:15:26.159]  They have abandoned laissez-faire in France.
[01:15:26.199 --> 01:15:29.722]  They're pretty much of a socialist government control orientation.
[01:15:30.799 --> 01:15:43.363]  But, nevertheless, when we look at nationalism, we all understand that we want the French to be able to be French, we want the Mexicans to be able to be Mexicans, the Americans to be able to be Americans, the British to be British, so forth.
[01:15:43.944 --> 01:15:45.764]  That is true multiculturalism.
[01:15:46.164 --> 01:15:59.949]  It is the globalists who want to eradicate this rich tapestry of cultures and homogenize us down to the lowest level possible so they can control us from a one world government.
[01:16:00.109 --> 01:16:04.791]  So we want to have this kind of variety, this kind of true multiculturalism.
[01:16:05.151 --> 01:16:07.512]  We just don't want to have it forced upon us in certain areas.
[01:16:07.532 --> 01:16:23.819]  We want people to have freedom of association, to have freedom of culture, to have borders and laws of their own choosing, rather than having it imposed upon us from a centralized position of control, which is what the globalist hardline left extremists want, okay?
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.201]  Let's call the globalists the extremists and the hardliners, because that's what they are.
[01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:28.602]  Well, David, perfect example.
[01:16:28.642 --> 01:16:36.404]  I was just reading a story this morning about how Venice, Italy is actually just they're having such an issue with the massive amount of tourism that's coming in there.
[01:16:37.105 --> 01:16:41.666]  And then with that, there are a lot of kebab shops and pizza by the slice.
[01:16:42.047 --> 01:16:42.847]  They're popping up.
[01:16:42.967 --> 01:16:45.408]  And so all these tourists are coming in and they're just grabbing their.
[01:16:45.828 --> 01:16:50.529]  Food to go and then taking it to the monuments and the sites and then leaving their trash everywhere.
[01:16:50.910 --> 01:17:05.474]  But all the actual shops and the local produce and the local businesses that make up Venice, Italy, they're not getting any tourism flow because they're just going to these quick things and then getting back on their cruise ship or, you know, however they get in.
[01:17:05.494 --> 01:17:06.554]  What's the same thing you see everywhere?
[01:17:06.574 --> 01:17:11.796]  They're making a law saying, look, you're deteriorating the very culture of Venice, Italy that you've come here to see.
[01:17:12.196 --> 01:17:12.556]  That's right.
[01:17:13.377 --> 01:17:22.704]  I know that when we first went to Britain, London in the 1980s, my wife and I, and there were all these small individual shops just like there were in America at one point in time.
[01:17:22.724 --> 01:17:27.948]  And then you have the big multinational hamburger places that come in and drive everybody out of business.
[01:17:28.008 --> 01:17:28.829]  And so you lose
[01:17:29.449 --> 01:17:38.151]  What made an area unique, and that's what you're talking about in Venice, the fact that the multinationals come in and they homogenize everything.
[01:17:38.191 --> 01:17:40.771]  They take out what is unique in that area.
[01:17:40.811 --> 01:17:43.912]  They drive the small businesses, the mom and pops, if you will.
[01:17:44.732 --> 01:17:47.253]  Britain was known as a nation of shopkeepers.
[01:17:47.293 --> 01:17:54.314]  Well, no more, because the shopkeepers are being driven out of business by centralized control, by Amazon or whatever.
[01:17:54.354 --> 01:17:58.875]  But in the food areas, it's the big multinational conglomerates that come in.
[01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:16.438]  Right, well and then, so kind of back to what's going on with the election there in France, remember we reported on this back in February that Facebook and Google are actually joining to help fight the fake news ahead of the French elections after they saw what happened here, they weren't able to curtail
[01:18:16.878 --> 01:18:17.038]  Yeah.
[01:18:35.305 --> 01:18:50.956]  Even this latest news with Macron's potential offshore account is spreading like wildfire to the point that prosecutors in Paris are actually opening up investigations into people like Jack Posobiec here in the U.S.
[01:18:51.236 --> 01:18:57.980]  because his name is huge on this internet algorithm saying, look, he is one of the main purveyors of this fake news.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.101]  What can we do?
[01:18:59.161 --> 01:19:00.062]  How can we stop him?
[01:19:00.982 --> 01:19:04.604]  Um, you know, and so this is just what's so interesting to see.
[01:19:04.885 --> 01:19:14.271]  Will they be successful in shutting down these posts and stopping the free information from being able to spread so they can get in their establishment?
[01:19:15.191 --> 01:19:20.655]  Well, I think what you're seeing kind of parallels in some respects the way that people are successfully competing.
[01:19:21.414 --> 01:19:23.455]  Against the bland multinationals.
[01:19:23.495 --> 01:19:29.596]  You know, they come in with their bleached out hamburgers and synthetic stuff.
[01:19:29.816 --> 01:19:36.838]  And the way that people compete against that is to have authentic, rich, counter food to that.
[01:19:37.198 --> 01:19:42.519]  And the trouble is that the tourists don't know where to go, so they fall back on what they're familiar with.
[01:19:42.759 --> 01:19:48.661]  But when you talk about the people who live there, when you talk about information, people want something that is authentic.
[01:19:48.741 --> 01:19:49.461]  That's the key thing.
[01:19:49.981 --> 01:19:51.663]  And so that's the struggle that they have.
[01:19:51.703 --> 01:19:56.406]  They're offering us this bland, fast food version of information and nobody's buying it.
[01:19:56.446 --> 01:19:57.407]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:19:57.587 --> 01:19:58.068]  Good point.
[01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:12.548]  We all know that when the Democratic Party blamed Hillary Clinton's loss on the Russians, it was the biggest dog-ate-my-homework excuse ever.
[01:20:12.689 --> 01:20:23.540]  But it seems now the vice president of the Democratic political firm Global Strategy Group said that according to their analysis, two-thirds of the voters Obama picked up in 2012
[01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:28.403]  Ended up leaving the Democratic Party to vote for Trump.
[01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:36.468]  So 70% of the reason Hillary Clinton lost can be attributed to her failure to pick up these prior Obama voters.
[01:20:36.648 --> 01:20:41.191]  She claims to be part of the resistance, but even Antifa doesn't want her.
[01:20:41.391 --> 01:20:45.673]  There have even been rumors circulating that she may try to run again in 2020.
[01:20:45.793 --> 01:20:47.795]  Rob Schneider recently tweeted, I'm Millie Weaver.
[01:20:47.815 --> 01:20:49.035]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:05.924]  Lee Stranahan.
[01:21:06.144 --> 01:21:08.106]  Lee Stranahan was formerly with Breitbart.
[01:21:08.526 --> 01:21:09.788]  He knew Andrew Breitbart.
[01:21:09.808 --> 01:21:11.529]  He also knows Steve Bannon.
[01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:14.112]  He is now the editor of ThePopulous.us.
[01:21:14.172 --> 01:21:16.494]  He's a co-host on Fault Lines on Sputnik.
[01:21:17.095 --> 01:21:19.817]  And he has a citizen journalism school.
[01:21:19.837 --> 01:21:22.480]  You find that at citizenjournalismschool.com.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:29.026]  But let's talk about the outsourcing of censorship first and the demonizing of individual sources, Lee.
[01:21:29.306 --> 01:21:31.728]  I don't like the term fake news, okay?
[01:21:31.808 --> 01:21:38.553]  There is such a thing as fake news, but the bigger problem, I think, is what I call narrative-driven news, which is this.
[01:21:38.613 --> 01:21:39.794]  Let's take a simple issue.
[01:21:39.814 --> 01:21:41.255]  I'm going to give just an example.
[01:21:42.016 --> 01:21:43.417]  Let's say immigration, okay?
[01:21:43.777 --> 01:21:47.400]  Now, let's say you've got two stories, and they're both completely true.
[01:21:48.201 --> 01:21:53.745]  One story is about a woman who came here illegally, and she's got three kids.
[01:21:53.825 --> 01:21:58.389]  She, you know, has worked for 20 years, but she's here illegally, and she's getting deported.
[01:21:59.029 --> 01:22:05.272]  The second story is about a woman whose child was killed by an illegal alien who'd been deported three times.
[01:22:06.053 --> 01:22:06.373]  Okay?
[01:22:06.753 --> 01:22:10.375]  Now, assume both of those stories are completely true, because those things both happened.
[01:22:10.455 --> 01:22:11.195]  Does that make sense?
[01:22:11.875 --> 01:22:12.116]  Right.
[01:22:12.716 --> 01:22:14.457]  Which story is CNN going to cover?
[01:22:15.197 --> 01:22:15.417]  Right?
[01:22:15.777 --> 01:22:15.978]  Yes.
[01:22:16.238 --> 01:22:18.059]  The deportation story of the victim.
[01:22:19.603 --> 01:22:21.424]  And which stories is Breitbart going to cover?
[01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:23.466]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:22:24.186 --> 01:22:34.394]  So, my point here is that what they don't like about sites like InfoWars is that you guys cover stories that are outside their narrative.
[01:22:34.774 --> 01:22:36.635]  You're outside their normal lane.
[01:22:36.795 --> 01:22:40.918]  To me, the issue is, are people going to be honest with you about what their bias is?
[01:22:40.978 --> 01:22:41.939]  Everybody's got a bias.
[01:22:42.279 --> 01:22:47.365]  And always in the past we would see the same stories put out by ABC, CBS, NBC.
[01:22:47.385 --> 01:22:50.488]  They would all choose to report the same stories and they would have the same angle.
[01:22:50.988 --> 01:22:54.192]  Now we have people who are coming out with a different narrative.
[01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:56.815]  We report the facts and we analyze the facts.
[01:22:57.155 --> 01:23:01.540]  CNN reports the facts, they analyze the facts, but they tell you that their facts are the only facts.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.201]  People can make up their own minds.
[01:23:03.221 --> 01:23:04.161]  And people can figure it out.
[01:23:04.181 --> 01:23:04.702]  You can, I can, David.
[01:23:04.802 --> 01:23:06.142]  All of the audience can.
[01:23:06.163 --> 01:23:07.183]  I can look at a New York Times story.
[01:23:24.353 --> 01:23:27.316]  And I know what their bias is, and I can filter that in.
[01:23:27.396 --> 01:23:34.021]  I can look at an InfoWars story, and I know where it comes from, and I can filter that out, and I can make up my own damn mind.
[01:23:34.582 --> 01:23:35.743]  That's what's scary to them.
[01:23:36.263 --> 01:23:38.865]  They're frightened to death that we can make up our own minds.
[01:23:39.206 --> 01:23:47.032]  And the wake-up call for them was Donald Trump being elected, because whatever you thought about Donald Trump, he wasn't supposed to win, right?
[01:23:47.052 --> 01:23:48.393]  He was supposed to lose.
[01:23:49.014 --> 01:23:52.157]  And that's when they realized the genie's out of the bottle.
[01:23:52.837 --> 01:23:54.598]  And they can no longer control us.
[01:23:56.499 --> 01:24:00.661]  It's almost like there's an info war going on.
[01:24:03.702 --> 01:24:08.805]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:09.485 --> 01:24:11.746]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:17.341 --> 01:24:18.622]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:18.642 --> 01:24:19.902]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:24:19.922 --> 01:24:23.344]  We've been talking about the upcoming French election that's coming up this Sunday.
[01:24:23.364 --> 01:24:25.065]  It's going to be very interesting.
[01:24:25.105 --> 01:24:30.828]  It's a big test of nationalism versus globalism, but it is even more than just a test.
[01:24:31.628 --> 01:24:36.831]  This will truly be the death knell of the EU if France leaves in addition to Britain.
[01:24:37.607 --> 01:24:45.101]  That will be leaving essentially the Germans by themselves, with only themselves to boss around instead of other people.
[01:24:45.201 --> 01:24:49.269]  So, before we go to a video that we got, which is really interesting because when you look at
[01:24:50.157 --> 01:24:54.621]  The issues before the French people, of course, a big part of this is the open borders.
[01:24:54.681 --> 01:24:56.102]  That's what the globalists want to do.
[01:24:56.142 --> 01:24:58.104]  They want to homogenize societies.
[01:24:58.504 --> 01:25:01.166]  They want to create chaos and conflict, bring in terrorism.
[01:25:01.787 --> 01:25:03.909]  And so this is a big part of the referendum.
[01:25:04.409 --> 01:25:10.735]  And we have a video here of some pro-migrant French being asked to house a refugee.
[01:25:11.355 --> 01:25:13.178]  And you'll see what their answers are.
[01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:14.139]  Very interesting.
[01:25:14.439 --> 01:25:15.140]  Very revealing.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:25.313]  Before we get to that video, real quickly, however, we really do want to thank you for your support with this 30-hour Megathon that we've done with the sale to fundraiser.
[01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:28.617]  And we have sold out of Supermail Vitality.
[01:25:29.438 --> 01:25:32.260]  We have extended the sales this weekend, but Supermail has sold out.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:39.643]  We're about to be sold out of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, and we're about to be sold out of DNA Force.
[01:25:40.063 --> 01:25:40.904]  We still have...
[01:25:41.727 --> 01:25:42.727]  Many things that are discounted.
[01:25:42.768 --> 01:25:46.409]  We have 20% off things like Secret 12, that's our vitamin B12 formula.
[01:25:46.949 --> 01:25:49.891]  20% off Knockout, all natural sleep aid.
[01:25:50.231 --> 01:25:54.973]  20% off Winter Sun, that's our natural vitamin D3 supplement.
[01:25:55.353 --> 01:26:00.656]  20% off Prostagard and Bio PCA and Biome Defense and Living Defense.
[01:26:01.016 --> 01:26:07.459]  As well as 30% off ProPure King water filters and 30% off Brain Force Plus.
[01:26:07.479 --> 01:26:08.959]  So you'll find all those specials.
[01:26:08.979 --> 01:26:10.320]  We're continuing through the weekend.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:19.465]  We really do appreciate your support, and as we pointed out, X2 Survival Shield Nascent Iodine is about to be sold out as well as DNA Force.
[01:26:19.965 --> 01:26:26.288]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com, take a look at the specials that are there, many deep discounts, and we thank you again for your support.
[01:26:26.468 --> 01:26:36.213]  Let's play this video that we've got of some pro-migrants being asked to house a refugee, and Leanne, you can read the subtitles for our radio audience as we play this video here.
[01:26:37.194 --> 01:26:37.434]  Go ahead.
[01:26:40.734 --> 01:26:42.695]  So this is the W9 television channel.
[01:26:42.735 --> 01:26:43.596]  They sent a man out.
[01:26:43.676 --> 01:26:46.798]  You know, what do you think about this massive arrival of migrants in France?
[01:26:47.158 --> 01:26:48.679]  And everyone's like, it's great.
[01:26:48.879 --> 01:26:50.100]  We're a welcoming country.
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:51.380]  It's positive.
[01:26:55.122 --> 01:26:56.163]  Do we have to welcome them?
[01:26:56.984 --> 01:26:57.644]  Yes, of course.
[01:26:58.104 --> 01:26:59.245]  But they also deserve it.
[01:27:01.038 --> 01:27:04.941]  And then it sort of says, well, would you be ready to welcome a migrant in your house?
[01:27:05.702 --> 01:27:06.502]  Of course, yes.
[01:27:06.522 --> 01:27:08.284]  I would love to do that.
[01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:09.685]  My house is open for them.
[01:27:11.006 --> 01:27:13.028]  Oh, we just so happen to have Slobodan right here.
[01:27:13.048 --> 01:27:14.609]  He needs a place to stay tonight.
[01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:16.511]  He's been traveling for two weeks.
[01:27:16.551 --> 01:27:17.231]  He's very hungry.
[01:27:17.291 --> 01:27:17.992]  He needs a shower.
[01:27:19.573 --> 01:27:19.973]  Wait a minute.
[01:27:19.993 --> 01:27:23.777]  You're kind of putting me on the spot here, you know, for me tonight.
[01:27:25.178 --> 01:27:27.560]  It's a little bit rude to ask me, you know, right in front of him.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.943]  So when you put them on the spot, they're like, uh, no, I can't.
[01:27:32.184 --> 01:27:32.864]  No, not tonight.
[01:27:33.865 --> 01:27:34.846]  I'll put them up in a hotel.
[01:27:35.567 --> 01:27:36.849]  Someone gives them 20 bucks.
[01:27:36.869 --> 01:27:38.931]  Go get a meal.
[01:27:39.031 --> 01:27:39.712]  Here's a shower.
[01:27:39.732 --> 01:27:43.415]  And that's, that's what it is.
[01:27:45.225 --> 01:27:46.346]  I'd rather give them money for lunch.
[01:27:46.366 --> 01:27:47.487]  That's not exactly possible.
[01:27:47.507 --> 01:27:48.689]  So there you go.
[01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:51.351]  Let them put their refugee where their mouth is.
[01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:52.653]  They deserve to be here.
[01:27:52.913 --> 01:27:55.255]  It's not just that we need to bring them in the country.
[01:27:55.315 --> 01:27:56.416]  They deserve to be here.
[01:27:56.436 --> 01:28:01.461]  We did this exact same video when we were having the influx with all of these.
[01:28:02.122 --> 01:28:03.003]  I don't know.
[01:28:32.282 --> 01:28:32.802]  Okay, let's play that.
[01:28:32.823 --> 01:28:38.486]  Passes the governors in our United States so that they don't want to take in Syrian refugees.
[01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:39.087]  Have you heard that?
[01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:41.448]  Uh, yeah.
[01:28:41.728 --> 01:28:42.609]  What do you think about it?
[01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:44.810]  I think they all ought to go read the Statue of Liberty.
[01:28:45.991 --> 01:28:48.573]  Do you think we should take refugees into this country?
[01:28:48.793 --> 01:28:49.213]  Of course!
[01:28:49.853 --> 01:28:51.274]  Everyone in this country has been a refugee.
[01:28:54.657 --> 01:28:55.277]  Email address.
[01:28:55.297 --> 01:28:59.560]  We're collecting email addresses to sign people up for taking them into their homes.
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.401]  You got a fat pad or what?
[01:29:02.023 --> 01:29:02.303]  No.
[01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:04.005]  I'm a street performer.
[01:29:04.466 --> 01:29:07.348]  Okay, but you still got, you know, running water.
[01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:08.950]  I mean, I got it.
[01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:11.933]  So you think that we should take the refugees?
[01:29:12.353 --> 01:29:12.874]  Absolutely.
[01:29:13.174 --> 01:29:13.595]  All right.
[01:29:15.296 --> 01:29:16.538]  Give us your email address.
[01:29:16.898 --> 01:29:18.740]  You're signing up to house some refugees.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:19.721]  That's what we need.
[01:29:20.041 --> 01:29:21.262]  I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:29:22.063 --> 01:29:23.745]  Would you be willing to take one into your own home?
[01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:26.910]  Well, a studio apartment, I don't know.
[01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:28.411]  Yeah, that's making sense.
[01:29:28.491 --> 01:29:31.671]  A studio apartment is better than, you know, another winter in the desert.
[01:29:34.832 --> 01:29:35.932]  I don't know if I would do that.
[01:29:35.952 --> 01:29:36.812]  Do you have room at your house?

[01:29:52.995 --> 01:29:54.235]  You're not going to be able to afford your home.

[01:33:14.167 --> 01:33:18.629]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:22.111]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.171 --> 01:33:25.152]  I'm David Knight here with Leanne McAdoo and as we were going to break
[01:33:25.868 --> 01:33:33.612]  You saw that video first in France, where they said, talked to all these people and said, yeah, yeah, we love refugees, we want them to come in.
[01:33:33.632 --> 01:33:35.173]  Well, we've got one right here.
[01:33:35.433 --> 01:33:36.053]  We're going to take him.
[01:33:36.093 --> 01:33:36.874]  And they all demurred.
[01:33:37.274 --> 01:33:41.276]  Then you had the one that was a little bit older, talking about Syrian refugees.
[01:33:41.296 --> 01:33:43.257]  And everybody said, yeah, we've got the Statue of Liberty.
[01:33:43.277 --> 01:33:44.858]  You really need to know what that's about.
[01:33:44.938 --> 01:33:46.599]  Certainly, I want refugees to come in.
[01:33:46.639 --> 01:33:49.280]  Well, will you give us your address and sign up for this?
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:50.461]  And they all start demurring.
[01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:52.802]  And many of them, I thought was interesting, because of course, this is New York.
[01:33:53.562 --> 01:33:55.144]  They have very small apartments.
[01:33:55.825 --> 01:33:56.385]  And guess what?
[01:33:57.266 --> 01:33:59.809]  You are going to have a smaller apartment.
[01:33:59.849 --> 01:34:00.970]  You're going to have a smaller home.
[01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:02.712]  You're going to lose your ability to own homes.
[01:34:03.453 --> 01:34:11.622]  If we open up our borders to unlimited numbers of people coming in here, then we say we're going to give them a free education.
[01:34:12.303 --> 01:34:12.964]  Just that alone.
[01:34:13.524 --> 01:34:16.166]  We'll destroy your home, your ability, your American dream.
[01:34:16.206 --> 01:34:18.008]  Because we have to educate the dreamers.
[01:34:18.268 --> 01:34:25.614]  So you can sacrifice the American dream so that you can provide a free education for anyone who wants to come here no matter the number.
[01:34:25.674 --> 01:34:27.275]  We don't have any say about that.
[01:34:27.355 --> 01:34:34.100]  That's going to be the globalists and the European Union and the people at the UN who are going to decide how many people we bring in here.
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.683]  And of course we're going to have to educate them in the language of their choice.
[01:34:37.883 --> 01:34:42.166]  We don't even want to try to create an American culture that's based on English.
[01:34:42.186 --> 01:34:42.687]  As a matter of fact,
[01:34:43.367 --> 01:34:51.531]  Jean-Claude Juncker, one of the EU officials, the president I think is his official title there, said, we're going to stop speaking English altogether.
[01:34:51.691 --> 01:34:53.172]  I do not like English.
[01:34:53.312 --> 01:34:56.113]  Okay, so they're going to, they don't like our cultures.
[01:34:56.153 --> 01:34:57.114]  They don't like us.
[01:34:57.174 --> 01:34:58.054]  We saw it from Macron.
[01:34:58.074 --> 01:34:59.855]  He doesn't like anybody who's nationalist.
[01:34:59.875 --> 01:35:02.477]  It doesn't matter whether you're English or whether you're French.
[01:35:02.877 --> 01:35:03.737]  He doesn't like the French.
[01:35:04.237 --> 01:35:06.058]  These people want to destroy every culture that they're in.
[01:35:06.078 --> 01:35:07.499]  But you're going to lose your home.
[01:35:08.072 --> 01:35:17.935]  You're going to be put in a tiny shoebox and it's going to be far more expensive than it is now because one of the biggest costs of your home are the property taxes that you pay for education.
[01:35:18.255 --> 01:35:21.896]  And that is exploding everywhere that we have this uncontrolled immigration.
[01:35:22.376 --> 01:35:26.358]  I want to go to the other part of what we've been talking about, of course.
[01:35:26.478 --> 01:35:31.219]  In the last 30 hours we've been doing this, well actually it ended yesterday.
[01:35:31.239 --> 01:35:33.020]  It seems like it's still going.
[01:35:34.005 --> 01:35:42.307]  But we had the 30-hour mega broadcast because there's so much attack on free speech in general and on InfoWars in particular.
[01:35:42.387 --> 01:35:45.347]  And a good example of this is a gentleman, his name is Michael DeBerry.
[01:35:45.367 --> 01:35:46.428]  You can find him on YouTube.
[01:35:46.668 --> 01:35:48.768]  You can also find him in New Orleans.
[01:35:48.828 --> 01:35:53.409]  My wife and I took a trip to New Orleans and we saw him there in the corner, the French corner.
[01:35:53.429 --> 01:35:55.029]  He's got a business that's set up there.
[01:35:55.569 --> 01:35:58.050]  He's got a stand, he sells t-shirts, other things like that.
[01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:59.631]  And he's got displays.
[01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:00.272]  You can't miss it.
[01:36:00.312 --> 01:36:03.555]  He's got displays about Infowars and Alex Jones and Donald Trump.
[01:36:04.115 --> 01:36:06.318]  He's dressed up like Uncle Sam most of the time.
[01:36:06.698 --> 01:36:08.480]  And he engages people in conversations.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.261]  And he has some very interesting conversations.
[01:36:10.301 --> 01:36:11.763]  He puts them up on his YouTube channel.
[01:36:12.203 --> 01:36:13.925]  Here's one of the interesting conversations.
[01:36:13.945 --> 01:36:14.946]  We did an article about it.
[01:36:14.986 --> 01:36:19.470]  Paul Joseph Watson, a crazed leftist, wants Alex Jones killed.
[01:36:20.231 --> 01:36:21.632]  She says he brainwashes people.
[01:36:21.672 --> 01:36:22.493]  He should be killed.
[01:36:22.533 --> 01:36:24.114]  And we're going to play this video for you here.
[01:36:24.934 --> 01:36:28.657]  She says, he says, ma'am, Alex Jones, you're saying, needs to be killed.
[01:36:28.737 --> 01:36:29.477]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:30.298]  She said, yeah, I am.
[01:36:30.318 --> 01:36:35.281]  He says, I want Alex Jones to be taken out, taken out for brainwashing.
[01:36:36.102 --> 01:36:37.323]  And she says she's a teacher.
[01:36:37.343 --> 01:36:40.345]  But unlike most teachers, she doesn't brainwash.
[01:36:41.125 --> 01:36:42.487]  She doesn't brainwash anybody.
[01:36:42.607 --> 01:36:42.847]  Right.
[01:36:42.947 --> 01:36:46.490]  But she doesn't want to hear other opinions and she knows better than you.
[01:36:47.031 --> 01:36:53.077]  And at one point she burst inexplicably into tears before saying my son has been completely brainwashed by this a-hole.
[01:36:53.858 --> 01:36:58.862]  And then they get into all of this and I want to, I'll just let you watch this as it unfolds.
[01:36:58.903 --> 01:37:03.247]  Here's Michael DeBerry talking to a teacher who doesn't like
[01:37:03.988 --> 01:37:05.369]  A conflict of ideas.
[01:37:05.449 --> 01:37:06.891]  She doesn't want a marketplace of ideas.
[01:37:06.931 --> 01:37:09.974]  She just wants to take out anybody that she disagrees with.
[01:37:10.094 --> 01:37:12.195]  Especially, especially Alex Jones.
[01:37:12.216 --> 01:37:13.256]  Let's start with InfoWars.
[01:37:13.276 --> 01:37:16.279]  We'll kill them first, and then we'll come for the rest of you.
[01:37:16.299 --> 01:37:18.902]  Remember the pastor in Germany?
[01:37:19.342 --> 01:37:21.404]  Okay, let's play this clip of Michael DeVere.
[01:37:22.921 --> 01:37:24.882]  Alex Jones needs to be killed.
[01:37:25.042 --> 01:37:25.622]  It doesn't matter.
[01:37:25.682 --> 01:37:26.923]  Famous last words.
[01:37:26.943 --> 01:37:28.944]  What do you got against free speech?
[01:37:28.984 --> 01:37:31.606]  What do you got against free speech, lady?
[01:37:31.746 --> 01:37:35.988]  I want you to listen to the people on the other side.
[01:37:36.128 --> 01:37:39.890]  Now this is totally different than what you think.
[01:37:51.912 --> 01:37:52.313]  Okay?
[01:37:53.394 --> 01:37:58.000]  I want Alex Jones to be taken out for brainwashing.
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:58.660]  Not free speech.
[01:37:58.921 --> 01:38:00.483]  I believe in free speech.
[01:38:00.503 --> 01:38:02.205]  You know what we were just doing?
[01:38:02.225 --> 01:38:03.807]  We were speaking freely and openly.
[01:38:03.887 --> 01:38:09.754]  And right now- But you're saying you want to stop someone who has a news program that millions of people listen to?
[01:38:10.294 --> 01:38:13.398]  And you want to go ahead and eliminate his brain?
[01:38:13.678 --> 01:38:14.980]  You want to get him killed?
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.783]  You want to basically, you want to eliminate free speech?
[01:38:18.103 --> 01:38:25.132]  How do you, how do you say you support free speech and at the same time want to stop someone from practicing it?
[01:38:25.352 --> 01:38:30.378]  Would you please tell me how you hold those two thoughts in your head and can justify them?
[01:38:33.524 --> 01:38:38.706]  When someone does something against my first opinion, you better believe I'm going to get aggressive.
[01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:43.648]  Now you tell me, how in the hell do you justify- No, I'm good.
[01:38:43.748 --> 01:38:44.069]  I'm good.
[01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:45.049]  I'm good, Andres.
[01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:51.152]  So now, you're talking about free speech, and I'm speaking freely to you.
[01:38:51.172 --> 01:38:52.932]  Are you going to listen to what I'm saying?
[01:38:52.953 --> 01:38:56.594]  Yes, I want to hear you qualify what you just said.
[01:38:56.714 --> 01:38:57.815]  I want you to hear it.
[01:38:57.855 --> 01:39:02.937]  And it doesn't matter, because you're a stranger to me, and I speak to both of your values.
[01:39:04.002 --> 01:39:08.108]  So you want to kill him?
[01:39:13.008 --> 01:39:17.353]  Rather than listen to what the man has to say, maybe he's saying something that makes sense.
[01:39:17.393 --> 01:39:18.594]  Maybe your son is right.
[01:39:18.935 --> 01:39:21.157]  You want to kill free speech.
[01:39:21.177 --> 01:39:23.599]  You don't even give your son credit to have his own mind.
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:24.961]  You are that bad.
[01:39:25.341 --> 01:39:28.564]  You don't give a **** about your son or anybody else, lady.
[01:39:28.845 --> 01:39:31.027]  All you care about is- Shut up.
[01:39:32.008 --> 01:39:32.468]  Or what?
[01:39:32.689 --> 01:39:33.529]  Or what, you mother******?
[01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:34.770]  Or what?
[01:39:35.351 --> 01:39:38.853]  I'm not at all affected by your upset.
[01:39:39.733 --> 01:39:42.515]  And you're not all affected in my being upset.
[01:39:43.915 --> 01:39:45.936]  I think you're the brain damaged one, lady.
[01:39:46.257 --> 01:39:49.058]  You're the one that's pissing all over the First Amendment.
[01:39:49.558 --> 01:39:50.999]  I see.
[01:39:51.059 --> 01:39:53.661]  You better seek help.
[01:39:54.501 --> 01:39:55.442]  I see.
[01:39:55.582 --> 01:39:57.483]  I see what's wrong.
[01:39:58.363 --> 01:39:59.364]  See what goes on?
[01:39:59.424 --> 01:40:01.345]  What, the free speech that you want to kill?
[01:40:01.625 --> 01:40:06.507]  I suppose you're all for that Berkeley riots, for them stopping Ann Coulter.
[01:40:06.788 --> 01:40:07.368]  Is she dead too?
[01:40:07.428 --> 01:40:08.388]  Should we kill her?
[01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:10.610]  How about Milo, the comedian?
[01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:14.992]  How about the comedian that they stopped in Berkeley too?
[01:40:15.012 --> 01:40:15.872]  You want him killed?
[01:40:16.153 --> 01:40:18.874]  How many people you want killed that you don't agree with, lady?
[01:40:19.594 --> 01:40:24.117]  Tell me how much totalitarian Nazi bull**** you got in you.
[01:40:26.733 --> 01:40:28.455]  Oh, you don't get it!
[01:40:28.515 --> 01:40:29.356]  Alright, that's good.
[01:40:29.376 --> 01:40:30.377]  Let's put it back here.
[01:40:30.657 --> 01:40:31.939]  You know, he's exactly right.
[01:40:31.979 --> 01:40:35.623]  It is Nazi totalitarian BS.
[01:40:36.064 --> 01:40:37.746]  You know, it was Pastor Martin Niemüller.
[01:40:37.786 --> 01:40:38.386]  He was a Christian.
[01:40:38.426 --> 01:40:39.828]  He said, you know, first they came for this group.
[01:40:39.868 --> 01:40:41.770]  I didn't do anything because I wasn't a member of that group.
[01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:44.453]  Then they came for another, another, another, and then they came for me.
[01:40:45.074 --> 01:40:46.716]  And there was nobody left to save me.
[01:40:46.876 --> 01:40:47.897]  They're coming for Alex!
[01:40:48.718 --> 01:41:00.149]  Every day there's another attack on Alex Jones, attack on Infowars, and as you have seen even with Fox News, you know, first they single out this person or that person, they do it with the Trump administration.
[01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:04.094]  They isolate, they attack, they take down, they move to the next one.
[01:41:04.474 --> 01:41:05.054]  They don't stop.
[01:41:05.695 --> 01:41:13.540]  And she stands there going on and on and on trying to convince him that it's a perfectly rational thing to take out Alex Jones.
[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.422]  Well she starts crying too.
[01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:16.382]  It's my feelings.
[01:41:16.622 --> 01:41:25.028]  I've been offended and I'm hurt and I feel like my child's been brainwashed and so because it hurts my feelings and I don't agree with it, he needs to be taken out.
[01:41:25.148 --> 01:41:26.509]  They tell you where your kids are brainwashed.
[01:41:26.529 --> 01:41:28.469]  They're brainwashed when you send them to college.
[01:41:28.529 --> 01:41:30.790]  I mean, we've talked about this over and over again.
[01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:40.795]  When you send them to the University of California system that has Janet Napolitano as the president of the entire university system.
[01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:43.516]  They don't want any free speech.
[01:41:43.876 --> 01:41:45.897]  And so these are the people, and here she is as a teacher.
[01:41:46.597 --> 01:41:58.043]  I'm going to explain to you rationally and, you know, she's very cold-blooded about it except for the point where she starts to cry about her son who listened to Alex and was convinced she doesn't want to convince you that Alex is wrong.
[01:41:58.063 --> 01:42:01.904]  She wants to convince you that Alex needs to be taken out and shot, okay?
[01:42:02.104 --> 01:42:06.266]  Which is what you see in the response to Alex when he went on with Piers Morgan.
[01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:09.988]  You know, let's just take him out and shoot him wearing a uniform.
[01:42:10.028 --> 01:42:11.249]  Remember when they did that?
[01:42:11.889 --> 01:42:29.317]  And that was perfectly okay to make those death threats, just like it's been perfectly okay to make death threats against President Trump and to have, how many was it, 50,000 mental health professionals signing a petition claiming Trump is too seriously mentally ill to perform the duties of president and should be removed under the 25th Amendment.
[01:42:30.197 --> 01:42:31.897]  Have they treated him?
[01:42:32.057 --> 01:42:47.540]  Those medical professionals, we ought to take that list and turn it over to the American psychiatric profession and say, you need to look at these people's credentials and maybe disbar them because you've already set up your own rules saying you're not going to do this kind of witch hunt with Barry Goldwater.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:56.002]  So these people need to be the ones who are investigated because they're out there making pronouncements about somebody that they don't know anything about.
[01:42:56.262 --> 01:42:56.702]  Exactly.
[01:42:56.722 --> 01:42:57.562]  It's their public persona.
[01:42:57.882 --> 01:42:58.403]  Exactly.
[01:42:58.443 --> 01:43:09.291]  They haven't personally treated him or even probably spoken to him whatsoever, but based on their political leanings and their perspective and the way they see the world, they can determine that this man is crazy.
[01:43:09.551 --> 01:43:15.816]  So do you think that they might perhaps do this in their own practice with someone else who's coming in thinking... Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:43:15.836 --> 01:43:17.177]  I disagree with your politics.
[01:43:17.197 --> 01:43:17.737]  You're crazy.
[01:43:17.977 --> 01:43:20.159]  What they're doing is they're using their credentials.
[01:43:20.399 --> 01:43:21.880]  They're abusing their credentials.
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:23.462]  They're saying, because I'm a doctor,
[01:43:24.062 --> 01:43:30.448]  And because as a doctor, I don't follow any of the rules by the American Psychiatric Association for ethics.
[01:43:30.828 --> 01:43:32.549]  I just diagnose people from afar.
[01:43:33.170 --> 01:43:37.974]  If they were my patient, I would release their information without getting a clearance for them.
[01:43:38.254 --> 01:43:45.901]  So because I don't follow any of these ethics rules, because I don't really do a real examination, but I went to school once.
[01:43:46.161 --> 01:43:57.430]  And I got a degree and I have credentials so therefore you should listen to me even though everything that I'm doing is totally unprofessional, totally unethical, still pay attention to me because I signed my name as part of this petition.
[01:43:57.470 --> 01:44:07.558]  Those 50,000 people who did that need to be looked at by their respective professional associations because they are abusing their professional credentials
[01:44:08.579 --> 01:44:10.461]  And that's what needs to be investigated.
[01:44:10.481 --> 01:44:11.442]  For political purposes.
[01:44:11.562 --> 01:44:13.404]  And we see that with climate change.
[01:44:13.444 --> 01:44:15.065]  We see that over and over again with climate change.
[01:44:15.105 --> 01:44:16.867]  They don't argue the facts.
[01:44:17.447 --> 01:44:19.549]  They argue that I'm an authority.
[01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:21.011]  Listen to me.
[01:44:21.031 --> 01:44:23.313]  I'm telling you what's going on.
[01:44:23.373 --> 01:44:27.096]  And I have seen this so many times of people making false pronouncements.
[01:44:27.176 --> 01:44:28.658]  I've pulled this out many times.
[01:44:28.718 --> 01:44:30.960]  The articles that we have from professionals.
[01:44:32.121 --> 01:44:40.350]  30, 35 years ago, talking about how we're going to be out of oil by the mid-1980s and we're going to be out of gas by the late 1980s and so forth and so on.
[01:44:40.710 --> 01:44:41.431]  Absolute nonsense.
[01:44:41.451 --> 01:44:42.833]  We're going to have global cooling.
[01:44:42.853 --> 01:44:43.934]  New York will be underwater.
[01:44:43.954 --> 01:44:45.636]  Yeah, we're going to go into a new ice age.
[01:44:45.676 --> 01:44:46.497]  Now we're going to go into...
[01:44:46.957 --> 01:44:52.939]  To global warming, and it was because of nitrogen, now it's because of carbon dioxide.
[01:44:52.959 --> 01:44:54.440]  It's just on and on and on.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:45:01.243]  These pronouncements these people make, not backed up by any facts and dire projections that cannot be tested.
[01:45:01.283 --> 01:45:03.383]  They're models that cannot be tested.
[01:45:03.743 --> 01:45:05.864]  And we know that they're rigging even their measurements.
[01:45:06.264 --> 01:45:07.605]  But, you know, they're authorities.
[01:45:07.745 --> 01:45:11.507]  And we need to listen to them because they've got a job somewhere in a university.
[01:45:11.767 --> 01:45:13.248]  Or there's somebody like Al Gore.
[01:45:13.788 --> 01:45:15.289]  What does Al Gore know about science?
[01:45:15.329 --> 01:45:17.670]  He doesn't know any more about it than Bill Nye.
[01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:20.332]  I mean, these people are not scientists.
[01:45:20.372 --> 01:45:23.293]  The inconvenient truth is that you got it all wrong.
[01:45:23.553 --> 01:45:26.455]  And now they're going to have inconvenient truth 2.0?
[01:45:29.561 --> 01:45:29.901]  Really?
[01:45:29.981 --> 01:45:33.562]  People are still going to buy your crap after you totally got everything wrong?
[01:45:34.103 --> 01:45:40.765]  And that now we've got their updated data and then they don't explain to you that they say, well, the hurricane cycles are on the rise.
[01:45:40.885 --> 01:45:42.165]  We're seeing more intense.
[01:45:42.225 --> 01:45:50.308]  But what they don't tell you is that they stopped calculating the data prior to 1980 that showed that hurricanes were actually, they had been declining.
[01:45:50.528 --> 01:45:52.168]  So now they're naturally rising back up.
[01:45:52.188 --> 01:45:53.289]  But they don't show you that.
[01:45:53.349 --> 01:45:57.710]  They just want you to understand the data that fits into their political agenda.
[01:45:58.070 --> 01:46:12.540]  And that's why when I see this thing about Trump and these Congress holding secret conversations and these doctors, what a dangerous precedent for psychiatrists to be able to determine someone's crazy because they don't agree with your politics and they just want to observe you from the outside.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:22.106]  Imagine how many people out there are on psychiatric drugs because some person is actually going beyond their professional capacity.
[01:46:22.146 --> 01:46:25.488]  They're just making a judgment on them based on their own paradigm.
[01:46:25.528 --> 01:46:26.549]  How dangerous is that?
[01:46:27.165 --> 01:46:29.227]  Yeah, it's unethical, it's unprofessional.
[01:46:29.567 --> 01:46:34.072]  Let's talk about, you know, Obama is out there saying that he's very concerned.
[01:46:34.112 --> 01:46:40.078]  He's watching Donald Trump and the House Republicans with this restructuring of Obamacare.
[01:46:40.498 --> 01:46:41.459]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:46:41.739 --> 01:46:43.641]  I think they have made some good strides in it.
[01:46:43.681 --> 01:46:47.265]  Quite frankly, I'll kind of tip my hand here and say that
[01:46:48.311 --> 01:46:50.154]  I want to see a real repeal.
[01:46:50.254 --> 01:46:51.736]  I want to see the framework end.
[01:46:52.317 --> 01:46:56.283]  I know that there's not support for that in the establishment Republican Party.
[01:46:56.724 --> 01:46:58.767]  So at least we're moving in the right direction.
[01:46:58.867 --> 01:47:03.574]  At least we're making some major movement in that respect by taking away the mandates
[01:47:04.295 --> 01:47:14.200]  Taking away a trillion dollars worth of taxes and giving people incentives instead of beating them over the head with a stick and a mandate, we're giving people tax credits.
[01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:15.280]  And this is not a deduction.
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.461]  Understand a tax credit.
[01:47:18.301 --> 01:47:24.324]  If you buy insurance and it's going to be a tax credit that is based on age and then they're also going to means test it.
[01:47:24.664 --> 01:47:29.667]  As we pointed out before, Obama is saying his business is being deconstructed.
[01:47:29.707 --> 01:47:31.007]  He didn't have a business.
[01:47:31.227 --> 01:47:32.448]  He had a socialist model.
[01:47:32.748 --> 01:47:35.030]  And we're going to look at what's happening in Venezuela right now.
[01:47:35.050 --> 01:47:36.592]  We need to call it Venezuelan health care.
[01:47:36.992 --> 01:47:37.913]  Look at this article here.
[01:47:38.053 --> 01:47:43.219]  Armored car hits a crowd as Venezuelan riots leave over 300 injured.
[01:47:43.759 --> 01:47:48.844]  This is what happens when you pretend that you're going to give people stuff for free.
[01:47:49.625 --> 01:48:00.768]  As I point out, everybody is saying, and we even have a GOP senator saying, any change to the healthcare situation is going to have to pass the Jimmy Kimmel test, that we're going to take care of little children.
[01:48:00.788 --> 01:48:03.649]  Look at that, they got, this is an armored car driving through the crowd.
[01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:05.750]  Wowing through a crowd, holy smokes.
[01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:12.332]  That's what it devolves into, because it always, when you look at communism, it always devolves into that.
[01:48:13.052 --> 01:48:16.774]  When you start stealing assets from people and just kicking the can down the road.
[01:48:16.814 --> 01:48:19.055]  And this is basically what Obamacare is doing.
[01:48:19.095 --> 01:48:20.175]  And we need to pull back from this.
[01:48:20.195 --> 01:48:22.736]  We've got a lot of Republicans who don't want to pull back from this.
[01:48:23.397 --> 01:48:26.438]  And we've got Republican Senators who are saying it needs to pass the Jimmy Kimmel test.
[01:48:27.038 --> 01:48:27.859]  As I pointed out before...
[01:48:29.581 --> 01:48:32.623]  This was a private charitable hospital in L.A.
[01:48:33.343 --> 01:48:39.647]  that has a budget of $233 million a year to provide care for poor children.
[01:48:39.927 --> 01:48:42.649]  Jimmy Kimmel could have afforded to pay for that out of his pocket.
[01:48:42.989 --> 01:48:44.550]  Jimmy Kimmel had insurance.
[01:48:45.130 --> 01:48:50.633]  And so his child would not have been uncovered if it wasn't for Obamacare.
[01:48:50.673 --> 01:48:54.436]  His child would not have had a pre-existing condition that was excluded.
[01:48:54.496 --> 01:48:56.237]  That was the lie of Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:48:57.017 --> 01:49:02.179]  But the true lie about all this is that the real pre-existing condition is socialism.
[01:49:02.559 --> 01:49:03.679]  That's what we see in Venezuela.
[01:49:04.159 --> 01:49:06.460]  What is happening to the children in Venezuela?
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:10.681]  The children in Venezuela are not getting even the most basic health care.
[01:49:11.121 --> 01:49:11.982]  They're not getting food.
[01:49:13.562 --> 01:49:15.443]  Because of their socialist policies.
[01:49:15.824 --> 01:49:17.965]  You cannot run a country on socialism.
[01:49:17.985 --> 01:49:23.129]  If you want more affordable health care, then what you have to have is a market-based structure.
[01:49:23.809 --> 01:49:24.910]  That will bring the cost down.
[01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:36.398]  To the extent that the government subsidizes it, we see that medical care goes up, we see that tuition goes up at college universities at a very fast rate because it's subsidized.
[01:49:36.418 --> 01:49:38.920]  They have no incentive to try to save money.
[01:49:39.815 --> 01:49:47.941]  And eventually you run out of other people's money, just like right now they're sweeping all this money out of Fannie and Freddie to pay for these subsidies.
[01:49:48.141 --> 01:49:53.545]  And as Mitch McConnell pointed out, he said, well, if your metric is getting universal coverage for everybody, it's a failure.
[01:49:54.165 --> 01:50:06.414]  Because we still have tens of millions of people who don't have any health care coverage in spite of the fact that they are stealing, there he is right there, that's a GOP senator saying it doesn't pass the Jimmy Kimmel test.
[01:50:07.094 --> 01:50:09.335]  Okay, well we'll tell you about that Jimmy.
[01:50:09.675 --> 01:50:15.918]  The Jimmy Kimmel propaganda that he did the other day doesn't pass the sniff test.
[01:50:16.158 --> 01:50:18.479]  They cannot, the socialists cannot deliver on the goods.
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:22.361]  They can't even deliver basic food to people in Venezuela.
[01:50:22.381 --> 01:50:24.222]  And you see those riots there, it's absolutely amazing.
[01:50:24.242 --> 01:50:27.424]  You know Leanne, when we were in China to adopt my daughter,
[01:50:28.447 --> 01:50:31.990]  Seeing that armored car go through the crowd there.
[01:50:32.010 --> 01:50:34.072]  In China, there's so many people on the street.
[01:50:34.132 --> 01:50:39.636]  It's kind of like, the only thing I've ever seen like that before was going to New York City on St.
[01:50:39.676 --> 01:50:40.297]  Patrick's Day.
[01:50:40.357 --> 01:50:42.819]  And this armored car pulls up on this crowded street.
[01:50:42.899 --> 01:50:43.640]  It's like a parade.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:44.680]  It's just packed with people.
[01:50:45.181 --> 01:50:50.465]  And a guy gets out with a loaded shotgun, double-barreled shotgun, pointing it at the crowd.
[01:50:50.805 --> 01:50:52.687]  And I said to my family, let's get out of here.
[01:50:52.887 --> 01:50:53.608]  This is insane.
[01:50:54.008 --> 01:50:56.930]  Lowered it down, pointing at everybody to intimidate people.
[01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:59.892]  It's like if one person pushes that, it's going to go off.
[01:50:59.952 --> 01:51:02.334]  This is absolutely insane and it's even worse than Venezuela.
[01:51:05.638 --> 01:51:06.979]  This is where you get breaking news.
[01:51:07.379 --> 01:51:10.301]  McMaster has a plan to send in ground troops to Syria.
[01:51:10.661 --> 01:51:14.664]  That story actually broke here on InfoWars four or five days ago.
[01:51:14.724 --> 01:51:15.725]  Bloomberg is covering it.
[01:51:15.785 --> 01:51:24.231]  So essentially whatever you're reading in the news today or tomorrow, this is all going to be on InfoWars five, ten, fifteen days before it ever reaches the mainstream.
[01:51:24.271 --> 01:51:26.672]  That is how good the sourcing is here.
[01:51:26.712 --> 01:51:27.613]  This is for real news.
[01:51:27.833 --> 01:51:36.465]  That is why not only are they trying to divide the base against Trump, they are now slandering Alex and me and other patriots, calling us Russian agents.
[01:51:36.585 --> 01:51:43.896]  They realize that this is the only place for real news and now they're trying to attack and lie about us and claiming that we're Russian agents and all that.
[01:51:44.056 --> 01:51:46.377]  We don't want to sit here and brag and say, we're right, we're right, we're right.
[01:51:46.457 --> 01:51:47.938]  They keep saying, we're lying, we're lying, we're lying.
[01:51:48.298 --> 01:51:52.980]  Because weeks ago, and then last week, we said, no, McMaster wants the troops.
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:54.740]  That's my source from the White House.
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:55.621]  Did you have your source?
[01:51:56.021 --> 01:51:57.381]  He wants 150,000 on the ground.
[01:51:57.622 --> 01:52:01.723]  Now Bloomberg comes out today and says, Trump has told Bloomberg, I don't want a war.
[01:52:01.743 --> 01:52:10.387]  But it turns out the aides were doing exactly what we said, trying to jockey and get them in place and move artillery in that wasn't for ISIS, but was for Assad.
[01:52:11.227 --> 01:52:11.707]  Exactly.
[01:52:11.747 --> 01:52:14.748]  So Bloomberg is now reporting what we covered a week ago.
[01:52:15.268 --> 01:52:21.250]  And one thing that frustrates me a little bit is the idea that we need Bloomberg to validate our reporting.
[01:52:21.330 --> 01:52:22.390]  Because this is real news.
[01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:25.231]  We don't make stuff up like ABC does, like Bloomberg does.
[01:52:25.591 --> 01:52:26.431]  They fabricate things.
[01:52:26.471 --> 01:52:28.852]  I put a transcript out of what the president said on Monday.
[01:52:28.932 --> 01:52:31.113]  It's what the president said, and I'm not going to say where it came from.
[01:52:31.793 --> 01:52:33.674]  Everybody knows we have contact with the president.
[01:52:33.854 --> 01:52:36.396]  The media is attacking that, saying, oh, look, Alex is making this up.
[01:52:36.656 --> 01:52:36.877]  What?
[01:52:37.017 --> 01:52:37.497]  I said it?
[01:52:37.757 --> 01:52:40.479]  It came out three days later, out of his mouth, the exact same words.
[01:52:40.779 --> 01:52:48.604]  And they are so desperate for war now that they're trying to claim that us, by trying to oppose a ground war in Syria, trying to save American lives.
[01:52:48.905 --> 01:52:55.989]  I mean, Alex, when I did that live stream, 11 hours, so many mothers called in and said, my son has PTSD.
[01:52:56.029 --> 01:52:56.890]  This is so sad.
[01:52:57.330 --> 01:52:58.351]  You know, it was heartbreaking.
[01:52:58.411 --> 01:53:00.712]  I could hardly even stay on the line.
[01:53:00.732 --> 01:53:01.353]  It was so sad.
[01:53:01.853 --> 01:53:03.754]  Moms do not want to do another war.
[01:53:03.794 --> 01:53:05.695]  They do not want the McMaster Plan to go through.
[01:53:06.055 --> 01:53:06.495]  Exactly.
[01:53:06.575 --> 01:53:07.695]  And again, we love our military.
[01:53:07.735 --> 01:53:08.696]  We criticize the wars.
[01:53:08.796 --> 01:53:12.057]  It's because it's not for our national sovereignty.
[01:53:12.077 --> 01:53:12.937]  It's not for our interests.
[01:53:13.017 --> 01:53:16.278]  This is one of the most elite publications published by the Rothschilds.
[01:53:16.319 --> 01:53:17.279]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[01:53:18.408 --> 01:53:22.755]  And they literally say, we're dupe idiots, and Assad tells us what to say.
[01:53:23.015 --> 01:53:26.280]  So now it's not just we're dupes of Putin, now it's Assad.
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:26.600]  No, no, no.
[01:53:26.821 --> 01:53:28.884]  We said first on Wednesday, false flag.
[01:53:29.204 --> 01:53:30.947]  We have the articles, the history, all of it.
[01:53:30.987 --> 01:53:31.628]  You did as well.
[01:53:32.129 --> 01:53:33.831]  Then, over the next week and a half,
[01:53:34.492 --> 01:53:38.253]  Everybody else from Putin to Ron Paul, everybody else came out and said it was a false flag.
[01:53:38.294 --> 01:53:39.974]  Again, we're the progenitors.
[01:53:40.314 --> 01:53:47.657]  We're not here grabbing it, you know, from Assad how a pair of self-publicists wound up as apologists for Assad.
[01:53:47.917 --> 01:53:49.598]  We're not apologizing for Assad.
[01:53:49.778 --> 01:53:51.799]  He didn't start the Civil War six years ago.
[01:53:52.059 --> 01:53:53.219]  He's never done anything to us.
[01:53:53.439 --> 01:53:54.340]  I mean, this is so crazy.
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:54:00.422]  Everything we say has just docked because we're going off what's already there and the sources we have.
[01:54:06.699 --> 01:54:07.721]  We're good to go.
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:22.761]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:22.801 --> 01:54:24.302]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:54:25.022 --> 01:54:28.225]  Just want to thank you for your support over our 30-hour broadcast.
[01:54:28.285 --> 01:54:30.366]  We have sold out of Supermail Vitality.
[01:54:30.386 --> 01:54:36.330]  We're about to sell out of Survival X2 Nascent Iodine and about to sell out of DNA Force and of course
[01:54:36.890 --> 01:54:44.473]  It's very expensive for us to produce DNA Force because of Bio-PQQ, a very rare, very valuable ingredient in that.
[01:54:45.053 --> 01:54:53.717]  You can look at the 175 clinical studies that support how effective that one particular ingredient is, but of course that's not the only thing that's in DNA Force.
[01:54:54.117 --> 01:55:01.140]  But that makes it very difficult for us to replace it, so when it sells out, it's out for a while, and it's about to sell out again, DNA Force.
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.721]  We do have a lot of products that are still
[01:55:04.261 --> 01:55:04.581]  We're good to go.
[01:55:04.601 --> 01:55:09.724]  We are in stock and still on sale, and we are extending this sale throughout the weekend to thank you for your support.
[01:55:10.124 --> 01:55:11.805]  We have 20% off Secret 12.
[01:55:11.845 --> 01:55:13.747]  That's our vitamin B 12 formulation.
[01:55:14.327 --> 01:55:15.528]  20% off knockout.
[01:55:15.588 --> 01:55:17.369]  That's our all natural sleep ingredient.
[01:55:17.929 --> 01:55:18.769]  20% off winter sun.
[01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:23.672]  A all natural vitamin D supplement as well as many other ingredients.
[01:55:23.992 --> 01:55:26.614]  30% off ProPure King water filters.
[01:55:26.634 --> 01:55:27.074]  30% off
[01:55:33.973 --> 01:55:39.601]  Make a special sale that we have there and take advantage of that while the supplies last.
[01:55:39.962 --> 01:55:41.384]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:55:41.974 --> 01:55:42.414]  Absolutely.
[01:55:42.474 --> 01:55:46.057]  Okay, Leanne, you've got a couple of, this is the last segment that you're here with us.
[01:55:46.137 --> 01:55:47.658]  Yeah, I've just got a little news blitz.
[01:55:47.698 --> 01:55:52.121]  Well, there's an article, I guess this is Homeland Security putting this out.
[01:55:52.281 --> 01:56:00.106]  ISIS, in their Islamic State magazine, they've published tutorials on vehicle knife and arson attacks in the past.
[01:56:00.126 --> 01:56:06.931]  So we know in their past magazines they say, this is the way that you can do these attacks and avoid any law enforcement figuring it out.
[01:56:07.171 --> 01:56:08.552]  Just go ram trucks into people.
[01:56:08.612 --> 01:56:11.034]  And we've seen that these jihadists have taken that
[01:56:12.314 --> 01:56:21.797]  Well, now they're putting in their magazines, use fake apartment and job listings in Craigslist ads to lure hostages and then murder victims.
[01:56:21.917 --> 01:56:29.559]  And so it's less about, they really just want to have as many assaults as humanly possible.
[01:56:30.279 --> 01:56:36.065]  So this is, I mean, this is something that's pretty scary because we're seeing that they're going, they're heeding the call.
[01:56:36.105 --> 01:56:37.446]  They're ramming the trucks into people.
[01:56:37.486 --> 01:56:44.313]  They're using knife attacks rather than trying to detonate things or suicide bombs and things like that.
[01:56:44.373 --> 01:56:45.855]  So this is interesting.
[01:56:45.875 --> 01:56:53.543]  We already know people have to be very careful when they answer these Craigslist ads or you want to go look and you know that we've seen women have been murdered
[01:56:54.123 --> 01:56:59.186]  When they went to go pick up baby clothes off Craigslist and someone would take their unborn child from them.
[01:56:59.647 --> 01:57:03.389]  Just really frightening things, but now you're having to worry about ISIS as well.
[01:57:03.449 --> 01:57:04.990]  So that's pretty scary.
[01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:12.315]  And then Rand Paul has now said that he has requested info officially on whether Obama surveilled him.
[01:57:12.495 --> 01:57:14.856]  Which we know that absolutely he's been under surveillance.
[01:57:14.876 --> 01:57:16.497]  He shakes the establishment.
[01:57:16.577 --> 01:57:17.718]  He's not afraid to get out there.
[01:57:18.138 --> 01:57:21.821]  But he has made now a formal request to see if he was indeed one of these.
[01:57:22.501 --> 01:57:28.073]  Americans that was inadvertently scooped up, incidentally surveilled by the Obama administration.
[01:57:28.434 --> 01:57:31.901]  Meanwhile, we have Huma Abedin, who the FBI knows
[01:57:33.488 --> 01:57:33.788]  I don't
[01:57:54.371 --> 01:57:55.632]  Don't try this at home.
[01:57:56.213 --> 01:58:00.336]  I know that Hillary Clinton committed multiple felonies and security violations.
[01:58:00.436 --> 01:58:01.857]  I know that Huma Abedin did it.
[01:58:02.258 --> 01:58:04.740]  But you know, they're very well-connected people in Washington.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.121]  Don't you try this.
[01:58:06.461 --> 01:58:11.065]  And as a matter of fact, they do send people after he made that disgusting statement.
[01:58:11.525 --> 01:58:15.787]  Talking about the double standard that he, as FBI Director, upholds.
[01:58:16.127 --> 01:58:17.268]  He ought to be impeached.
[01:58:17.348 --> 01:58:18.428]  He ought to be put in jail.
[01:58:18.468 --> 01:58:19.489]  He ought to be deposed.
[01:58:19.949 --> 01:58:21.790]  This guy is worse than J. Edgar Hoover.
[01:58:21.850 --> 01:58:25.231]  At least J. Edgar Hoover had the decency to lie to us about what he was doing.
[01:58:25.551 --> 01:58:27.512]  James Comey does it to our face!
[01:58:27.912 --> 01:58:29.033]  You're a disgrace, Comey.
[01:58:29.413 --> 01:58:30.493]  You're an absolute disgrace.
[01:58:30.533 --> 01:58:31.494]  Stay with us when we come back.
[01:58:31.914 --> 01:58:39.076]  We're going to talk about more of this intel that was sought by the NSA on people and putting out unredacted names.
[01:58:39.556 --> 01:58:40.756]  Not just in the Trump administration.
[01:58:41.017 --> 01:58:44.157]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.197 --> 01:58:46.098]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.778 --> 01:58:47.998]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.817 --> 01:59:01.426]  After being... InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:01.646 --> 01:59:08.072]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:59:08.313 --> 01:59:16.601]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:59:16.861 --> 01:59:25.604]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:59:25.864 --> 01:59:31.626]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:59:31.966 --> 01:59:32.426]  It works.
[01:59:32.726 --> 01:59:41.031]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[01:59:41.071 --> 01:59:50.596]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[01:59:50.936 --> 01:59:52.176]  A total 360 win.
[01:59:54.798 --> 02:00:00.721]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.757 --> 02:00:17.880]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:00:18.681 --> 02:00:20.122]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.784 --> 02:00:27.507]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:27.567 --> 02:00:28.688]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:00:29.509 --> 02:00:33.512]  We are going to take a look at Obamacare, but we're going to do it in the next segment.
[02:00:33.792 --> 02:00:37.295]  We're going to take a look at the proposed changes, what happens at this point.
[02:00:37.875 --> 02:00:40.277]  We have some signals from the Democrats.
[02:00:40.297 --> 02:00:41.058]  They think they won.
[02:00:41.698 --> 02:00:43.299]  They're taunting the Republicans.
[02:00:43.439 --> 02:00:46.820]  Said, oh, oh, na-na-na-na, hey-hey, goodbye.
[02:00:47.321 --> 02:00:48.941]  Well, I'm not so sure about that.
[02:00:49.622 --> 02:00:50.622]  We just had an election.
[02:00:51.122 --> 02:00:52.403]  And they're in such denial.
[02:00:52.423 --> 02:00:55.304]  They think that Trump didn't win the election.
[02:00:55.344 --> 02:00:57.125]  They think the Republicans didn't win the election.
[02:00:57.405 --> 02:00:59.246]  They think the Russians rigged everything.
[02:00:59.466 --> 02:01:01.287]  They're believing their own nonsense.
[02:01:02.127 --> 02:01:07.150]  We have a majority of people in this country who want to see this gone.
[02:01:08.218 --> 02:01:11.360]  And it is a win to even move in that direction.
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:15.522]  We're going to talk about the details of this and how far we have gone.
[02:01:15.542 --> 02:01:24.266]  Of course they have left the structure in place in many regards and we don't like that, but it's a good beginning and at least they're getting some movement on that.
[02:01:24.326 --> 02:01:26.067]  So we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[02:01:26.087 --> 02:01:27.268]  We're also going to talk about
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:30.621]  The spying on Americans.
[02:01:30.641 --> 02:01:32.302]  Let's talk about that now, as a matter of fact.
[02:01:32.422 --> 02:01:38.926]  We had, and Leanne was talking about this, Rand Paul wants to know what they collected on him.
[02:01:39.186 --> 02:01:40.647]  And we have this article from Circa.
[02:01:40.667 --> 02:01:46.291]  President Obama's team sought NSA intelligence on thousands of Americans during the election.
[02:01:47.267 --> 02:01:52.190]  They got thousands of intelligence reports with unredacted names of U.S.
[02:01:52.230 --> 02:01:54.672]  residents during the 2016 election.
[02:01:54.772 --> 02:01:57.374]  Understand, this is political surveillance, folks.
[02:01:58.034 --> 02:02:00.115]  This is what makes this so insidious.
[02:02:00.576 --> 02:02:02.757]  They are collecting information on U.S.
[02:02:02.797 --> 02:02:03.758]  presidential candidates.
[02:02:03.838 --> 02:02:11.883]  The NSA, the National Security Agency, this agency that was created by an executive order by President Truman.
[02:02:12.403 --> 02:02:14.084]  They don't even have a charter like the CIA.
[02:02:15.265 --> 02:02:21.167]  And it came out during the Church Committee hearings and during the Pike House Committee hearings.
[02:02:21.748 --> 02:02:26.469]  They were looking at the NSA and the CIA because they knew at the time that they were spying on Americans in the 1970s.
[02:02:26.609 --> 02:02:27.890]  This is when they had the hearing.
[02:02:27.930 --> 02:02:30.531]  They had been spying on Americans from the very beginning.
[02:02:30.551 --> 02:02:33.152]  We were told, we're going to create these spy agencies, but don't worry.
[02:02:33.592 --> 02:02:34.912]  They're going to be used abroad.
[02:02:34.932 --> 02:02:36.073]  They're not going to be used on you.
[02:02:36.173 --> 02:02:37.233]  So they had these hearings.
[02:02:37.253 --> 02:02:43.474]  That's where you see the famous heart attack gun that they were passing around, talking about their assassination attempts.
[02:02:43.534 --> 02:02:45.255]  And of course, there's some more news about that today.
[02:02:45.275 --> 02:02:46.355]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[02:02:46.675 --> 02:02:50.696]  Nevertheless, we do know the government does engage in assassinations that came out then.
[02:02:50.716 --> 02:02:53.036]  But that was the salacious part that they focused on.
[02:02:53.717 --> 02:02:58.598]  And they did that so that people wouldn't pay much attention to the fact that they were spying on Americans.
[02:02:59.358 --> 02:02:59.838]  But they were.
[02:03:00.652 --> 02:03:10.233]  And so they said, well, we're going to create the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that's going to prohibit you from surveilling American citizens unless they are engaged in activity with suspects abroad.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:14.541]  And they created a so-called court, which is not a court at all.
[02:03:14.801 --> 02:03:20.343]  It has a single judge, and that's where they go to get their search warrants, and they don't get a specific search warrant.
[02:03:20.363 --> 02:03:30.487]  Remember in the Constitution, there's this quaint little idea that you will go before a judge and get a search warrant, and you'll be specific about who you're looking at, why you're looking at them.
[02:03:31.147 --> 02:03:48.691]  Where you're going to look, what you expect to find, and then the judge is supposed to protect your privacy and look at that and say, okay, I have enough reason, all these different reasons, and all these, and I'll give you the ability to search for these particular things at this particular time and place on this particular person.
[02:03:48.731 --> 02:03:56.032]  Instead, now they go to the so-called court that is part of the FISA Act, and they get a search warrant for Mr. and Mrs. Verizon.
[02:03:56.552 --> 02:03:59.093]  And the secret court, the star chamber court,
[02:03:59.919 --> 02:04:01.026]  Of one person.
[02:04:01.772 --> 02:04:02.235]  One person.
[02:04:03.476 --> 02:04:08.400]  Puts out edicts that they say are modifying our Constitution, as if there was anything left of the Constitution.
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:12.563]  But we're not allowed to know what these secret amendments to the Constitution are.
[02:04:12.583 --> 02:04:16.246]  This is the Orwellian, Kafkaesque world that they have created here.
[02:04:16.966 --> 02:04:28.715]  But even when they were having the Church and Pike Committee hearings, when they called in the NSA, they said, we'd like to see your, well it wasn't a charter, but we'd like to see your executive order they created you in, the head of the NSA said, no, I'm going to show it to you.
[02:04:28.935 --> 02:04:29.876]  You're just the Congress.
[02:04:30.917 --> 02:04:33.240]  I work for the president, as we saw Michael Hayden do.
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:35.042]  So this is the arrogance of these people.
[02:04:35.062 --> 02:04:35.703]  What did they collect?
[02:04:35.743 --> 02:04:48.739]  They collected intelligence on presidential candidates, on members of Congress, on journalists, on clergy, on lawyers, on federal judges, on doctors, and they did it as part of the election.
[02:04:49.219 --> 02:04:51.480]  This is a political police state.
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:53.381]  You have to understand where this is going to go.
[02:04:53.421 --> 02:04:55.482]  They're going to come after the politicians first.
[02:04:55.922 --> 02:04:59.884]  The politicians have the capability to stop this and expose this.
[02:05:00.205 --> 02:05:02.746]  They will be the first ones up against the wall by this police state.
[02:05:03.917 --> 02:05:12.862]  We all know that when the Democratic Party blamed Hillary Clinton's loss on the Russians, it was the biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever.
[02:05:13.002 --> 02:05:23.848]  But it seems now the vice president of the Democratic political firm Global Strategy Group said that according to their analysis, two-thirds of the voters Obama picked up in 2012
[02:05:25.129 --> 02:05:28.712]  ended up leaving the Democratic Party to vote for Trump.
[02:05:28.832 --> 02:05:36.757]  So 70% of the reason Hillary Clinton lost can be attributed to her failure to pick up these prior Obama voters.
[02:05:36.958 --> 02:05:41.501]  She claims to be part of the resistance, but even Antifa doesn't want her.
[02:05:41.701 --> 02:05:45.983]  There have even been rumors circulating that she may try to run again in 2020.
[02:05:46.083 --> 02:05:49.325]  Rob Schneider recently tweeted, I'm Millie Weaver, for more reports go to InfoWars.com.
[02:06:03.115 --> 02:06:06.476]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
[02:06:06.696 --> 02:06:08.376]  Minor words and his was action.
[02:06:08.977 --> 02:06:10.497]  His was what he's done to women.
[02:06:10.537 --> 02:06:16.199]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[02:06:16.439 --> 02:06:18.739]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[02:06:19.099 --> 02:06:24.021]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[02:06:24.101 --> 02:06:25.281]  Four of them here tonight.
[02:06:25.401 --> 02:06:30.703]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:44.291]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[02:06:45.152 --> 02:06:46.612]  It's a fight for our minds.
[02:06:47.273 --> 02:06:49.213]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.

[02:07:33.524 --> 02:07:34.024]  That's amazing.
[02:07:34.104 --> 02:07:34.564]  Incredible.
[02:07:34.784 --> 02:07:37.825]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:07:37.845 --> 02:07:39.105]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[02:07:39.205 --> 02:07:40.786]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:07:40.866 --> 02:07:42.026]  And I love you guys.
[02:07:42.106 --> 02:07:43.526]  I love the InfoWars crew.

[02:08:09.086 --> 02:08:09.567]  News.
[02:08:10.127 --> 02:08:10.968]  Analysis.
[02:08:11.468 --> 02:08:12.129]  Reports.
[02:08:12.909 --> 02:08:15.031]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:15.812 --> 02:08:18.654]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[02:08:25.959 --> 02:08:27.441]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.601 --> 02:08:30.083]  You hear them tide the whipping post, and of course they have
[02:08:30.848 --> 02:08:33.212]  I think that they've got the Republicans tied, the Whipping Post folks.
[02:08:33.252 --> 02:08:33.612]  They don't.
[02:08:34.794 --> 02:08:44.169]  They had yesterday, as they passed this change in the House of Representatives, the change to Obamacare.
[02:08:45.245 --> 02:08:49.389]  The Democrats started chanting, na-na-na-na, hey-hey, goodbye.
[02:08:49.769 --> 02:08:59.458]  They think they're going to be going, and they said, look, we put this bill out there, and based on what CNN and the mainstream media told the public, only 17% of the people supported it.
[02:08:59.538 --> 02:09:01.159]  Well, what a surprise.
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:02.320]  What a surprise.
[02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:04.302]  Wait till they see the changes.
[02:09:04.762 --> 02:09:09.406]  Wait till you stop beating them with a stick, and you start offering them carrots.
[02:09:09.707 --> 02:09:11.028]  I think that's going to change things.
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:21.542]  You know, when people were being beaten with a stick of Obamacare, they were demanding that it be repealed, that it be ended, end this mandate, end these trillion dollars worth of taxes.
[02:09:22.142 --> 02:09:24.083]  This is supposed to make things more affordable?
[02:09:24.123 --> 02:09:26.043]  They put taxes on medical devices!
[02:09:26.103 --> 02:09:28.104]  They put taxes on health insurance!
[02:09:28.544 --> 02:09:30.124]  That doesn't make it more affordable!
[02:09:30.644 --> 02:09:32.325]  It destroys things to tax them.
[02:09:32.785 --> 02:09:33.925]  The Democrats don't get it.
[02:09:34.545 --> 02:09:36.106]  And you know, they say, well, we've only got 17% support.
[02:09:36.126 --> 02:09:36.266]  Well,
[02:09:38.186 --> 02:09:39.908]  I don't know that's going to really affect Congress.
[02:09:39.988 --> 02:09:42.151]  Congress only has 17% support.
[02:09:42.532 --> 02:09:48.179]  The latest Real Clear Politics, where they take averages of polls, shows 18.9% support for Congress in general.
[02:09:51.016 --> 02:09:54.437]  And that ranges from 11 to 23 percent on the polls.
[02:09:54.517 --> 02:10:03.519]  So there is no more support for Congress as they are now than there is for Obamacare as they present it to people.
[02:10:03.559 --> 02:10:04.419]  But we're going to take a look at it.
[02:10:04.459 --> 02:10:12.180]  But of course, Joe Biden, who seems to be positioning himself to run in 2020, comes out and says this was a day of shame in Congress.
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:14.421]  Millions of Americans will lose coverage.
[02:10:14.861 --> 02:10:17.902]  It's up to the Senate now, hoping for courage to return.
[02:10:20.543 --> 02:10:23.787]  It's not focused on making health care affordable.
[02:10:24.247 --> 02:10:25.869]  It is focused on coverage.
[02:10:26.049 --> 02:10:28.372]  And it was never, they never had it.
[02:10:28.672 --> 02:10:29.453]  They stole it.
[02:10:30.334 --> 02:10:37.382]  We keep telling you over and over again, the way that they paid for these subsidies for people is to sweep it out of Fannie and Freddie.
[02:10:37.402 --> 02:10:38.764]  They stole from investors.
[02:10:39.861 --> 02:10:45.424]  You can't support something like... Eventually they're going to run out of the money from the Fannie and Freddie investors.
[02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:46.785]  They run out of other people's money.
[02:10:46.825 --> 02:10:48.425]  They can't have it when that happens.
[02:10:48.486 --> 02:10:50.286]  And now we see that it's got to move to the Senate.
[02:10:50.747 --> 02:10:51.907]  What are they going to do in the Senate?
[02:10:52.027 --> 02:10:54.729]  It was passed by a very narrow margin in the House, 217 to 213.
[02:10:57.905 --> 02:11:03.809]  As I point out, Senate leaders now are saying, well, we don't know that we're really interested in doing this.
[02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:08.673]  We've got our own bill that we're going to do, and then it's going to come back as part of reconciliation.
[02:11:09.454 --> 02:11:17.720]  And in one way, that's good, because as part of the reconciliation process, it immediately does not have to do the 60-vote test.
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:20.302]  It only has to have 51 votes, and they have 52 Republicans who
[02:11:23.524 --> 02:11:24.265]  I think so.
[02:11:41.781 --> 02:11:46.928]  And Lindsey Graham came back and he was being booed by the crowd and he says, here's what I think should happen next.
[02:11:47.008 --> 02:11:48.891]  I think presidents should reach out to Democrats.
[02:11:49.211 --> 02:11:50.252]  I'd reach out to Democrats.
[02:11:50.773 --> 02:11:54.998]  Hey Lindsey, the Democrats don't want anything changed with Obamacare.
[02:11:55.039 --> 02:11:56.220]  They love taxes.
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:58.643]  They love telling everybody what to do.
[02:11:59.807 --> 02:12:04.269]  You have to understand, there were so many different things that were wrong with health care to start with.
[02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:08.032]  Even before Obama started making it far worse.
[02:12:08.272 --> 02:12:15.195]  25 years ago, when I was working with the LP, and we were getting a slate of candidates to run in North Carolina, one of the candidates was a doctor.
[02:12:16.416 --> 02:12:18.517]  And he explained something to me that I never knew about.
[02:12:18.537 --> 02:12:20.478]  A thing called Certificate of Need.
[02:12:20.538 --> 02:12:23.960]  Any of you medical professionals out there probably knew about this.
[02:12:24.621 --> 02:12:26.662]  If you want to open a private hospital,
[02:12:27.515 --> 02:12:32.999]  In competition to the government hospitals that are owned and subsidized by the counties and so forth.
[02:12:33.059 --> 02:12:43.707]  If you want to do that, or even if you have a private hospital or a practice, and you wanted to add something like an MRI machine at the time, you had to get a certificate of need.
[02:12:44.547 --> 02:12:55.375]  You had to apply to your competitor, the government, that was running the county hospitals, and you had to say, well I'd like to buy another x-ray machine, or I'd like to buy this kind of machine, or that.
[02:12:56.292 --> 02:12:58.454]  I'd like to expand my hospital.
[02:12:58.574 --> 02:13:01.896]  I would like to go into competition with you, County Hospital.
[02:13:02.397 --> 02:13:10.062]  And they would say, well, you have to make a case that you're really needed because we don't want you going into competition with us.
[02:13:11.624 --> 02:13:17.268]  And Hillary Clinton was telling everybody at the time, we've got to have a single payer because competition is making this too expensive.
[02:13:17.308 --> 02:13:19.289]  No, competition makes things less expensive.
[02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:22.352]  All of us who've had a real business know that.
[02:13:23.186 --> 02:13:29.310]  Barack Obama thinks that he's watching his business that he created eight years ago be dismantled before his eyes.
[02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:30.371]  It wasn't a business.
[02:13:30.571 --> 02:13:36.334]  It's not a business when you hold a gun to somebody's head and you force them to buy protection.
[02:13:37.135 --> 02:13:38.095]  That's a racket.
[02:13:38.636 --> 02:13:41.438]  That's what the mafia does to real businessmen.
[02:13:41.478 --> 02:13:49.603]  They come into a neighborhood, they come into a small Italian neighborhood and they hold a gun to your head and say, you need to pay us for insurance, for protection insurance.
[02:13:50.855 --> 02:13:51.556]  Protection from what?
[02:13:51.616 --> 02:13:55.360]  Protection from me, because I'm going to blow your head off if you don't give me money.
[02:13:55.881 --> 02:13:58.924]  And everything that the government does is a protection racket.
[02:13:59.685 --> 02:14:03.128]  So let's talk about some of the protection rackets that these people did here.
[02:14:03.148 --> 02:14:09.796]  In a sense, when you repeal some of this stuff, again going back to experiences in North Carolina,
[02:14:10.495 --> 02:14:17.661]  One of the things we talked about is getting rid of the income tax completely, abolishing the income tax, abolishing the IRS.
[02:14:17.821 --> 02:14:18.862]  That's where we want to go.
[02:14:18.962 --> 02:14:22.425]  But let's come up with something that is along those lines.
[02:14:22.525 --> 02:14:28.690]  And so we decided, those of us who were putting together ads and putting together candidates, we said, let's do an ad.
[02:14:28.891 --> 02:14:29.931]  We can run it on cable.
[02:14:30.872 --> 02:14:38.419]  And we had a situation at the time, and it may still be the situation in North Carolina, we had sales tax on everything, including food.
[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:51.206]  And so we did a little commercial where we had a bag of groceries, and we said the American Revolution, we had like some, you know, Fife and Drum Corps music in the background, we said the American Revolution was fought over a 3% tax on tea.
[02:14:51.966 --> 02:15:00.570]  Here in North Carolina, whatever the sales tax was at the time, 6, 7, 8%, I don't know, we have a 6% tax on everything that you eat.
[02:15:01.410 --> 02:15:02.011]  Have you had enough?
[02:15:03.031 --> 02:15:04.212]  Vote for us, we'll get rid of this.
[02:15:04.772 --> 02:15:05.832]  Just give them something.
[02:15:06.012 --> 02:15:06.673]  Give them something.
[02:15:07.475 --> 02:15:15.240]  And you know, the interesting thing was, the Democrats who owned that state at the time, because it took them 150 years getting Republicans in a majority after Reconstruction.
[02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:15.901]  That's the other thing.
[02:15:15.981 --> 02:15:17.422]  People don't want to talk about history.
[02:15:17.442 --> 02:15:22.185]  You don't want to talk about why the Democrats had a lock on the South for so long.
[02:15:22.325 --> 02:15:26.268]  It was the horrible things that were done under Reconstruction.
[02:15:26.288 --> 02:15:28.009]  But let's not talk about that in the schools.
[02:15:28.049 --> 02:15:29.850]  Let's not ever talk about Reconstruction.
[02:15:30.671 --> 02:15:31.571]  Let's keep that secret.
[02:15:31.691 --> 02:15:34.113]  Nevertheless, they eventually did get Republicans in there.
[02:15:34.153 --> 02:15:35.594]  They did cut taxes on things.
[02:15:38.055 --> 02:15:43.139]  At the time, the Speaker of the House, who was a Democrat, started talking.
[02:15:43.179 --> 02:15:43.920]  He heard that.
[02:15:44.060 --> 02:15:48.743]  And he started talking about how they were thinking about getting rid of the tax on food.
[02:15:48.763 --> 02:15:49.784]  And so he thought, oh, that's good.
[02:15:49.904 --> 02:15:51.745]  Maybe we'll at least get something like that done.
[02:15:51.785 --> 02:15:52.866]  Raise awareness of the public.
[02:15:52.886 --> 02:15:53.727]  Well, we didn't win.
[02:15:54.508 --> 02:15:57.491]  And the talk about getting rid of that tax evaporated.
[02:15:57.511 --> 02:15:59.173]  They didn't do anything about that.
[02:15:59.394 --> 02:16:02.297]  But let's look at some of the taxes that were repealed from Obamacare.
[02:16:02.317 --> 02:16:08.024]  This is on the Drudge Report and this is from the Americans for Tax Reform, I believe is the site.
[02:16:08.825 --> 02:16:12.049]  They had taxes, they had the individual mandate tax, you know, you don't pay
[02:16:13.330 --> 02:16:20.352]  You don't buy this insurance from the people and the quantities and the things that they dictate to you, then you're going to get taxed from the IRS.
[02:16:20.392 --> 02:16:22.133]  Your employer will get taxed, okay?
[02:16:22.613 --> 02:16:25.254]  You had a tax on health savings accounts.
[02:16:25.274 --> 02:16:30.115]  So if you're doing a responsible thing and trying to set money aside to pay for emergencies, they would tax it.
[02:16:30.595 --> 02:16:32.336]  They would tax your flexible spending accounts.
[02:16:32.676 --> 02:16:35.458]  They would tax the chronic care tax.
[02:16:35.718 --> 02:16:37.859]  They would tax health insurance itself.
[02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:41.061]  They had a surtax on investment income, 3.8%.
[02:16:41.101 --> 02:16:51.827]  And people talk about that, but again, they don't talk about the massive theft, they call it a net asset sweep, out of Fannie and Freddie, taking all the money out of that, and that's still being done.
[02:16:51.907 --> 02:16:54.729]  That has not been repealed by the Republicans or by Donald Trump.
[02:16:54.749 --> 02:16:59.612]  They had a tax on medical devices, because you know, this is going to make healthcare more affordable.
[02:17:00.012 --> 02:17:09.036]  So we do that by taxing health insurance, by taxing medical devices, by taxing prescription drugs, by taxing retiree prescription drugs and coverage.
[02:17:10.277 --> 02:17:13.499]  Altogether, you total this stuff up, it's about a trillion dollars worth of taxes.
[02:17:13.519 --> 02:17:18.321]  So yes, I would be happy to see the government cut a trillion dollars in taxes.
[02:17:18.741 --> 02:17:19.221]  Good for them.
[02:17:19.341 --> 02:17:20.642]  I would like to see full repeal.
[02:17:20.762 --> 02:17:22.163]  I would like to get rid of the income tax.
[02:17:22.243 --> 02:17:25.244]  But if we can cut the tax rates, I'm all for that as well.
[02:17:27.409 --> 02:17:30.700]  Yes, they still have the structure there, and if we look at the different things that are being done...
[02:17:31.906 --> 02:17:41.529]  We see the general pattern of things, which you're not going to really find in the establishment coverage of this, is that they're getting rid of the mandate.
[02:17:41.549 --> 02:17:42.249]  They're repealing it.
[02:17:42.649 --> 02:17:54.552]  They're saying, yes, we're going to have the insurance companies do pre-existing conditions, but if you let your coverage lapse for 63 days, you've got to pay a 30% surcharge for a year.
[02:17:54.692 --> 02:17:55.372]  Things like that.
[02:17:55.652 --> 02:17:56.573]  It's still not insurance.
[02:17:56.993 --> 02:17:57.893]  Don't call it insurance.
[02:17:58.453 --> 02:18:01.154]  It is still some kind of an entitlement program.
[02:18:01.595 --> 02:18:08.018]  They're trying to keep this thin veneer of marketplaces there, but it's not.
[02:18:08.218 --> 02:18:19.044]  But nevertheless, they are moving this by taking away taxes on medical devices, health insurance, drug companies, health insurance plans, and so forth and so on, and offering you a tax credit
[02:18:19.824 --> 02:18:20.404]  If you buy it.
[02:18:20.464 --> 02:18:27.788]  So instead of forcing you to do this, punishing you to do this, they say, if you will buy health insurance, we're going to give you a tax credit.
[02:18:28.009 --> 02:18:29.189]  Understand, not a deduction.
[02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:35.213]  And here's the deal, if they really wanted to help you to afford your health care,
[02:18:36.092 --> 02:18:43.455]  They would have given you, at least they would have taken away the restrictions that they have in terms of even taking a tax deduction.
[02:18:43.495 --> 02:18:47.657]  First of all, if you don't take the standard deduction, you're not going to be able to deduct your medical expenses.
[02:18:47.717 --> 02:18:53.320]  If you have a lot of medical expenses and a home mortgage, then maybe you can get a itemized deduction.
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:57.741]  But then they're going to take away 10% of your adjusted gross income before you even get to deduct that.
[02:18:57.841 --> 02:19:09.924]  Then when you deduct that, let's say that you're in a 30% tax bracket, that means that if you had left $1,000 worth of medical expenses, you're only going to get $300 of that.
[02:19:10.404 --> 02:19:13.265]  So they keep cutting it, cutting it, cutting it.
[02:19:13.665 --> 02:19:18.706]  If they really wanted you to be able to afford health care, they would have let you pay for it before you send the taxes to them.
[02:19:19.066 --> 02:19:20.707]  But instead, they gave you more taxes.
[02:19:21.834 --> 02:19:23.015]  They gave you more mandates.
[02:19:23.515 --> 02:19:28.438]  They put hidden taxes on medical devices and other things like that, and drugs and insurance.
[02:19:29.038 --> 02:19:31.240]  So they didn't want you to be able to afford taxes.
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:35.722]  It was about controlling you, making you dependent upon the government.
[02:19:36.163 --> 02:19:42.927]  And at least in this basic format, not knowing all the details and not knowing what the Senate is going to do,
[02:19:43.727 --> 02:19:48.252]  At least what you have now is a tax credit of $2,000 if you're very young.
[02:19:48.312 --> 02:19:51.415]  If you're older, $4,000 because your rate is going to be high.
[02:19:51.595 --> 02:19:53.017]  That's a credit.
[02:19:53.517 --> 02:19:57.281]  The bottom line, that's a dollar-for-dollar deduction of your taxes.
[02:19:57.542 --> 02:19:57.922]  Stay with us.
[02:19:57.942 --> 02:19:58.503]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:02.987 --> 02:20:04.689]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:23.504]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:20:23.664 --> 02:20:29.129]  The reality is it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.

[02:20:37.237 --> 02:20:41.701]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[02:20:41.961 --> 02:20:50.770]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[02:21:02.430 --> 02:21:03.953]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[02:21:04.963 --> 02:21:16.975]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[02:21:16.995 --> 02:21:22.160]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[02:21:22.481 --> 02:21:23.321]  You look them up for yourself.
[02:21:23.982 --> 02:21:33.706]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[02:21:33.846 --> 02:21:39.989]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[02:21:40.869 --> 02:21:42.710]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[02:21:43.711 --> 02:21:44.931]  People are falling apart.
[02:21:44.951 --> 02:21:45.992]  They're totally depressed.
[02:21:46.012 --> 02:21:46.552]  They're unhappy.
[02:21:47.132 --> 02:21:48.093]  What is going on?
[02:21:49.373 --> 02:21:53.215]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[02:21:54.451 --> 02:21:57.052]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[02:21:57.432 --> 02:21:59.132]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:21:59.332 --> 02:22:06.334]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:22:06.574 --> 02:22:14.876]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWarsLife products.
[02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:22.805]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[02:22:23.186 --> 02:22:26.588]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:22:26.648 --> 02:22:29.771]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[02:22:30.372 --> 02:22:35.456]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:22:35.976 --> 02:22:39.118]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:22:39.418 --> 02:22:49.844]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[02:22:49.964 --> 02:22:51.805]  The bone is so amazing.
[02:22:51.825 --> 02:22:57.428]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[02:22:58.547 --> 02:23:01.469]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[02:23:02.009 --> 02:23:07.452]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[02:23:07.732 --> 02:23:17.196]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[02:23:17.477 --> 02:23:22.039]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[02:23:22.259 --> 02:23:24.060]  This is a absolute win-win.
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:26.902]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[02:23:27.182 --> 02:23:33.306]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.

[02:23:48.415 --> 02:23:51.017]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[02:23:51.715 --> 02:23:54.977]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[02:23:55.417 --> 02:23:58.858]  Join me at InformersLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[02:24:16.286 --> 02:24:17.527]  Ira Hayes
[02:24:20.629 --> 02:24:22.010]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:22.090 --> 02:24:26.273]  I'm David Nyan and I just got a message about the extended special.
[02:24:26.373 --> 02:24:27.314]  We've heard from Alex.
[02:24:27.594 --> 02:24:30.896]  He's extending these specials for just 72 hours more.
[02:24:30.936 --> 02:24:36.200]  We've extended it through the weekend as a thanks, but we are also running out of stock.
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:36.861]  We have run out
[02:24:37.541 --> 02:24:38.202]  We're good to go.
[02:25:01.938 --> 02:25:09.544]  There's many items on that list from 20 to 30 plus percent off discount that has been extended throughout the weekend.
[02:25:10.065 --> 02:25:13.388]  I want to play for you a clip, a highlight of the
[02:25:14.819 --> 02:25:36.988]  30 hour broadcast we had with Alex Jones and Ron Paul and we were just talking before about his son Rand Paul saying I want to know if I'm one of the people that you've been collecting information on because they relaxed Obama relaxed the rules for the NSA and of course they had thousands of people who are involved in politics people who were journalists and others and this is politically based folks you have to understand this
[02:25:37.308 --> 02:25:40.589]  I got something that I thought was kind of funny from Charlie Skelton.
[02:25:40.609 --> 02:25:47.532]  He's a reporter that covers Bilderberg for The Guardian and I met him in Bilderberg and I'll read that to you when we come back later.
[02:25:47.552 --> 02:25:51.514]  But let's play this clip here of Alex Jones and Ron Paul.
[02:25:56.599 --> 02:25:57.540]  Let me bring this up to you.
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:00.862]  I don't know if you saw it, but it was in national news.
[02:26:01.963 --> 02:26:19.235]  I got the secret documents through Mike Cernovich that Google was spending millions of dollars to delist InfoWars, and they listed because I played clips of Ron Paul saying this is probably a false flag in Syria, and because I played Putin, and because I played some army colonels, and they said this is an example of fake news.
[02:26:19.935 --> 02:26:24.541]  So delist Alex Jones and have an army of trolls go out and start voting him down.
[02:26:24.601 --> 02:26:29.407]  Now, because we published the document two days later, they said, OK, rogue contractors did that.
[02:26:29.467 --> 02:26:30.469]  We're going to stop now.
[02:26:30.789 --> 02:26:32.331]  But it wasn't because you were fake news.
[02:26:32.371 --> 02:26:37.518]  They admitted in 2013, 2016, that the rebels got caught launching fake attacks.
[02:26:37.918 --> 02:26:39.259]  We had this rush to judgment.
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:41.601]  The British ambassador says it's clearly the rebels.
[02:26:41.942 --> 02:26:45.545]  It sets a precedent where the rebels can stage events and then we rush to judgment.
[02:26:46.045 --> 02:26:52.031]  Your son helped lead the move in the Senate to not have a rush to judgment in 2013 and beat Al Qaeda slash ISIS's air force.
[02:26:52.471 --> 02:26:53.912]  So we've now gotten to the point where...
[02:26:54.813 --> 02:26:57.474]  I have a member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York suing me.
[02:26:58.194 --> 02:26:59.154]  I've been told shut up.
[02:26:59.254 --> 02:27:00.855]  I have George Soros' firm suing me.
[02:27:01.135 --> 02:27:06.136]  I have Dr. Corsi bragging that Obama looted $300 billion out of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac for Obamacare.
[02:27:06.196 --> 02:27:08.897]  I've been told shut up about that or we'll destroy you.
[02:27:09.497 --> 02:27:12.518]  So that's the type of stuff, the type of messages that I've got.
[02:27:12.558 --> 02:27:16.699]  Now I know as a congressman you probably got threats too, but I've never had it at this level.
[02:27:17.039 --> 02:27:21.140]  What do you make of that and why do you think they were so scared of me?
[02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:23.801]  They listed playing Ron Paul clips.
[02:27:25.390 --> 02:27:30.854]  Well, they're protecting the state and they're protecting the deep state as well.
[02:27:32.515 --> 02:27:42.383]  Two individuals that went to prison that were in Congress, for one major reason, they were both very, very strong anti-IRS and wrote books against them.
[02:27:42.463 --> 02:27:44.104]  I think that was their major problem.
[02:27:48.007 --> 02:27:50.548]  What we have developed here is sort of a fascist system.
[02:27:50.889 --> 02:27:57.312]  You know, the government doesn't own Google and all this social media, but they have control over it.
[02:27:57.332 --> 02:28:01.414]  And they've sold out to the government because they're collecting all the information.
[02:28:01.514 --> 02:28:10.698]  And, oh, the government doesn't collect this, but if we need it, Google will give it to us, and all these organizations, Facebook, they'll give it to them because they're exempt from any liability.
[02:28:10.738 --> 02:28:13.920]  The Congress gave them the exemption that you can't go to.
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:18.701]  If somebody in social media has turned over your information, they're not liable.
[02:28:18.801 --> 02:28:20.362]  But the Congress gave them that.
[02:28:20.682 --> 02:28:23.563]  So it's a mixture of big business and big government.
[02:28:24.203 --> 02:28:26.084]  And it's a terrible thing.
[02:28:26.124 --> 02:28:27.424]  And there's big money involved.
[02:28:27.464 --> 02:28:32.806]  It has nothing to do with helping the poor people or helping the middle class get medical care.
[02:28:33.386 --> 02:28:41.315]  Uh, it's, uh, it's power, and it's control, and it's protection of the state, and that's why whistleblowers are the greatest enemies of this, you know.
[02:28:41.616 --> 02:28:44.459]  The truth becomes treason when you have an empire.
[02:28:44.539 --> 02:28:51.647]  We have an empire, so anybody who tells the truth, and it'll be in relative levels, they're going to go after those individuals.
[02:28:52.027 --> 02:28:53.929]  So, uh, that's what we're up against.
[02:28:54.089 --> 02:28:54.650]  When I left the
[02:28:54.770 --> 02:29:02.277]  Congress this past time, I listed some of the concerns and my number one concern was the destruction of the First Amendment to speak out.
[02:29:02.397 --> 02:29:17.092]  Believing sincerely, if you and I still have the privilege, the right to speak out without the government coming down on us, that we could change the system because ideas have consequences and they're more powerful than armies.
[02:29:17.552 --> 02:29:22.113]  But our enemies, the opposition, understands this.
[02:29:22.493 --> 02:29:27.155]  Because if we can silence people, you know, we can silence those ideas.
[02:29:27.335 --> 02:29:28.275]  I don't think they can.
[02:29:28.835 --> 02:29:32.156]  Ideas can't be stopped by armies, and we know that.
[02:29:32.196 --> 02:29:39.458]  So I think the ideology is where the battle has to be, not with what Trump is going to do tomorrow.
[02:29:39.918 --> 02:29:40.558]  I agree.
[02:29:40.578 --> 02:29:41.979]  Let me just say this in closing.
[02:29:42.299 --> 02:29:44.819]  I am very honored to be demonized like you have been over the years.
[02:29:44.839 --> 02:29:46.480]  I'm very honored to join that exclusive club.
[02:29:51.954 --> 02:29:54.936]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.956 --> 02:29:58.559]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:57.933 --> 02:31:05.156]  During that 30-plus hour live transmission that kicked off Wednesday and ran right through Thursday, we saw massive, massive support.
[02:31:05.436 --> 02:31:08.898]  Spreading the word, spreading the articles, and our free newsletters.
[02:31:08.938 --> 02:31:09.999]  We can stay in contact.
[02:31:10.079 --> 02:31:10.779]  It's been amazing.
[02:31:10.959 --> 02:31:18.845]  That's why I'm going to go ahead and extend some of the biggest sales we've had in six months right through this weekend, right through until Monday morning.

[02:31:39.624 --> 02:31:43.468]  More is coming in the next few weeks, but I will keep that discounted until it sells out.

[02:32:14.071 --> 02:32:14.672]  Amazing.
[02:32:14.732 --> 02:32:15.512]  Game-changing.
[02:32:15.592 --> 02:32:16.373]  Tip of the spear.
[02:32:16.873 --> 02:32:19.976]  Very best out there from our years of research from the top labs.
[02:32:20.156 --> 02:32:23.119]  Then of course we have Living Defense Parasite Cleanse.

[02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:29.004]  We have DNA Force that's back in stock for a limited time, and much, much more.
[02:32:29.024 --> 02:32:30.266]  There's a lot of other specials.

[02:32:37.793 --> 02:32:42.818]  So for myself, Alex Jones, and the InfoWars family, I want to thank you, because you are family.
[02:32:47.509 --> 02:32:49.991]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[02:32:50.031 --> 02:33:02.182]  If you're interested in healthy thyroid, if you're interested in well-being, if you're interested in having a higher IQ, which this has been linked to, get your powerful Survival Shield X2 at infowarstore.com.
[02:33:04.944 --> 02:33:09.989]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.154 --> 02:33:45.074]  During our 30-plus hour live transmission in defense of free speech and in defense of the West, we have seen an absolute outpouring of support, of listeners spreading our articles and videos, and of people openly pledging to pray for our operation and pray for this country and this world to be set free from the bondage of the purely selfish, evil, satanic forces of globalism.
[02:33:45.854 --> 02:33:47.395]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:33:47.896 --> 02:33:49.717]  Infowars wouldn't exist without you.
[02:33:49.817 --> 02:33:51.058]  You are the Infowar.
[02:33:51.538 --> 02:34:05.068]  The globalists want to destroy this outlet because they want to destroy a platform where the people can come together for sovereignty and for prosperity and for free market capitalism and for religious freedom and for the nation-state.
[02:34:05.888 --> 02:34:10.874]  And for men and women and families and children that are all under assault.
[02:34:11.595 --> 02:34:20.505]  We have the Bill Nye the Science Guy, a 1990s program cutting out where they break down the X and Y chromosomes and what makes us human, men and women.
[02:34:21.306 --> 02:34:25.150]  Men and women now existing and science is hurtful to someone else.
[02:34:25.931 --> 02:34:34.278]  This is the globalists using our well-meaning openness and our tolerance to get us to hate our species and give up on our life force.
[02:34:35.118 --> 02:34:43.004]  And the attacks calling us fake news by the fake news that CNN and others really show how sick these people are and how they're attempting to shut down free speech.
[02:34:43.425 --> 02:34:48.689]  So in the face of the Federal Reserve Board members suing us and George Soros' law firm launching the suit,
[02:34:49.798 --> 02:35:00.407]  And in the face of Google admittedly censoring us, it is we, the people, of every race, color, and creed, who bleed red blood, the human race, that are fighting back and saying no.
[02:35:00.507 --> 02:35:08.913]  So again, during that 30-plus hour live transmission that kicked off Wednesday and ran right through Thursday, we saw massive, massive support.
[02:35:09.194 --> 02:35:12.576]  Spreading the word, spreading the articles, and our free newsletters.
[02:35:12.616 --> 02:35:13.677]  We can stay in contact.
[02:35:13.777 --> 02:35:15.659]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:35:15.759 --> 02:35:16.480]  It's been amazing.
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:18.962]  And the financial support has been incredible as well.
[02:35:19.722 --> 02:35:21.603]  Again, we're not funded by George Soros.
[02:35:21.623 --> 02:35:23.223]  We're actually sued by his law firm.
[02:35:23.883 --> 02:35:26.684]  We're not funded by the big Islamic groups.
[02:35:26.704 --> 02:35:27.645]  We're actually sued by them.
[02:35:28.105 --> 02:35:31.186]  We're not empowered by the establishment.
[02:35:31.226 --> 02:35:35.647]  We are empowered by you, your prayers, your support, and your financial support.
[02:35:36.307 --> 02:35:44.030]  That's why I'm going to go ahead and extend some of the biggest sales we've had in six months, right through this weekend, right through until Monday morning.
[02:35:44.390 --> 02:35:45.210]  We have a giant
[02:35:45.610 --> 02:35:56.435]  30% off discount on ProPure King Water Filters, the big, nice tabletop stainless steel Rolls-Royce model that cuts out all the garbage but leaves the good minerals in.
[02:35:56.815 --> 02:36:01.978]  We've got 30% off our amazing Nootropic, and of course that's Brain Force.
[02:36:02.018 --> 02:36:04.139]  That's going to be selling out very, very soon.
[02:36:04.419 --> 02:36:08.180]  More is coming in the next few weeks, but I will keep that discounted until it sells out.
[02:36:08.401 --> 02:36:10.241]  That may come before Monday.
[02:36:10.582 --> 02:36:13.283]  20% off our Methylcobalamin Pure Organic
[02:36:13.843 --> 02:36:17.125]  Vitamin B12, that's so amazing, you take under the tongue.
[02:36:17.405 --> 02:36:25.489]  20% off winter sun, the vitamin D3, that I take also in the summer as well, but it's essential in the winter, because that's how you produce vitamin D mainly, is through the sun on your skin.
[02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:27.490]  Prostagard, an amazing formula.
[02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:28.451]  20% off.
[02:36:28.931 --> 02:36:31.653]  20% off Bio PCA for the skin and the nails.
[02:36:32.614 --> 02:36:33.375]  And so much more.
[02:36:33.756 --> 02:36:34.557]  Biome Defense.
[02:36:35.218 --> 02:36:37.541]  The 25 billion cultures per pill.
[02:36:38.202 --> 02:36:38.763]  Amazing.
[02:36:38.843 --> 02:36:39.604]  Game-changing.
[02:36:39.684 --> 02:36:40.445]  Tip of the spear.
[02:36:40.926 --> 02:36:44.991]  Very best out there from our years of research from the top labs of a...
[02:36:46.505 --> 02:36:51.847]  Nutraceutical is absolutely critical as a probiotic in your life.
[02:36:53.447 --> 02:36:56.368]  Then of course we have Living Defense Parasite Cleanse.
[02:36:56.408 --> 02:36:57.408]  That's 20% off.
[02:36:57.908 --> 02:37:02.129]  We have DNA Force that's back in stock for a limited time and much, much more.
[02:37:02.169 --> 02:37:03.350]  There's a lot of other specials.
[02:37:03.690 --> 02:37:05.410]  A lot of items have free shipping as well.
[02:37:05.891 --> 02:37:07.231]  If you sign up for AutoShip,
[02:37:07.591 --> 02:37:09.732]  You get an additional 10% off.
[02:37:10.032 --> 02:37:15.315]  You can sign up every month, every two months, every three months, every six months for it to automatically be shipped to you.
[02:37:15.936 --> 02:37:18.837]  And then you get an additional 10% off on every order.
[02:37:19.337 --> 02:37:20.578]  You can cancel anytime.
[02:37:21.138 --> 02:37:24.180]  All orders of $50 or more also get free shipping.
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:27.382]  So this is total free will, free association.
[02:37:27.782 --> 02:37:28.763]  If you resonate,
[02:37:29.673 --> 02:37:36.176]  With our research, if you see how we're changing the world together, it's symbiotic, then get the high-quality nutraceuticals.
[02:37:36.276 --> 02:37:38.797]  Get the high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:37:39.537 --> 02:37:43.719]  Get a Trump is my president shirt to trigger the anti-free speech globalists.
[02:37:44.539 --> 02:37:51.742]  It's all there at InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or you can call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:37:51.982 --> 02:37:56.084]  But regardless of whether you financially support us or not, pray for us.
[02:37:57.549 --> 02:38:02.192]  Spread the word about InfoWars, because we can overcome the bots, the Google censors.
[02:38:02.632 --> 02:38:06.854]  We can overcome, with human ingenuity, their attempts to turn the U.S.
[02:38:06.894 --> 02:38:10.996]  and European Internet into something that resembles the Communist Chinese censored Internet.
[02:38:11.476 --> 02:38:13.037]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[02:38:13.137 --> 02:38:17.300]  Thank you to the crew that does such an amazing job during these marathon broadcasts.
[02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:22.504]  And thank you to everyone out there who is spreading the word, because what you're doing is changing the world.
[02:38:22.824 --> 02:38:27.187]  We've been growing, we've been changing the paradigm, we've been waking up millions of people.
[02:38:28.088 --> 02:38:38.717]  This is an animating contest of liberty, and you're about to see more reporters, more crew, new studios, more field reporters, more action, more victory against the globalists.
[02:38:39.177 --> 02:38:41.479]  Their ideology is twisted, evil, and weak.
[02:38:42.239 --> 02:38:44.922]  Our ideology is based in truth and honor and strength.
[02:38:45.322 --> 02:38:47.203]  And when good men and women of every color
[02:38:47.964 --> 02:38:56.171]  And every creed, take action, nothing on earth can stop human development and our long march to the stars in God's great plan.
[02:38:56.371 --> 02:39:01.335]  So for myself, Alex Jones, and the InfoWars family, I want to thank you, because you are family.
[02:39:01.675 --> 02:39:03.197]  And I want to, just again,
[02:39:03.877 --> 02:39:14.787]  Thank God for all the blessings of creation, and all the blessings of consciousness, and my children, and my family, and the amazing tribulations and persecutions that God has carried me personally through.
[02:39:15.147 --> 02:39:16.228]  Thank you, God.
[02:39:16.688 --> 02:39:18.410]  Thank you for Christ, your Son.
[02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:20.251]  Thank you for the ultimate sacrifice.
[02:39:20.552 --> 02:39:23.214]  Thank you for humbling yourself and becoming one of us.
[02:39:23.254 --> 02:39:26.377]  You can experience what we're going through at our level.
[02:39:26.697 --> 02:39:28.339]  And thank you for forgiving us.
[02:39:28.919 --> 02:39:33.965]  For the trespasses we've engaged in and not recognizing the incredible gift of consciousness you've given us.
[02:39:34.306 --> 02:39:35.848]  So, again, to God, thank you.
[02:39:36.028 --> 02:39:37.009]  To my family, thank you.
[02:39:37.170 --> 02:39:38.151]  To the listeners, thank you.
[02:39:38.351 --> 02:39:39.332]  And to my crew, thank you.
[02:39:39.693 --> 02:39:40.514]  I love you all.
[02:39:44.113 --> 02:39:48.017]  Alright, that was Alex Jones, and of course, as part of the 30-hour broadcast, we had a lot of guests.
[02:39:48.097 --> 02:39:52.781]  We played the interview just earlier of Alex talking to Ron Paul.
[02:39:53.582 --> 02:40:02.310]  Roger Stone is going to be doing the fourth hour, and Alex wanted to play one of the interviews that he had with Roger Stone as part of that 30-hour broadcast.
[02:40:02.330 --> 02:40:05.633]  Here's that interview between Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[02:40:10.624 --> 02:40:13.026]  How do we keep President Trump honest?
[02:40:13.126 --> 02:40:29.941]  I mean, look, we'd be idiots if we didn't say, thank God we got Gorsuch, thank God that they didn't get the Supreme Court, thank the good Lord above that we've got 300 billion in new jobs coming in and 3 trillion plus in the stock market and China's respecting us again and we're getting some better deals there and all these new companies are coming back, on and on and on and on and on.
[02:40:29.981 --> 02:40:32.123]  I mean, the first 70 days were almost perfect.
[02:40:32.203 --> 02:40:33.464]  I was just like floating on a cloud.
[02:40:33.904 --> 02:40:37.187]  And 70 days in, I thought, oh, is that just a shill that Bannon's out?
[02:40:37.327 --> 02:40:37.668]  Clearly,
[02:40:38.708 --> 02:40:39.689]  The course changes.
[02:40:39.789 --> 02:40:41.210]  Now who is advising the president?
[02:40:41.230 --> 02:40:45.592]  I know he hears a bunch of people and then he makes the decisions, but clearly course changed.
[02:40:45.912 --> 02:40:48.494]  Is that because the whole government was just blocking in both parties?
[02:40:48.734 --> 02:40:49.754]  He couldn't get people in?
[02:40:50.114 --> 02:40:51.355]  There was a government revolt?
[02:40:51.415 --> 02:40:52.576]  We know the deep state did that.
[02:40:52.616 --> 02:40:53.236]  That's admitted.
[02:40:53.856 --> 02:40:55.197]  And then now he's having to compromise?
[02:40:55.217 --> 02:40:55.958]  Is that what's happening?
[02:40:55.978 --> 02:41:00.320]  Because I still see a lot of good he's doing, but you can see now that it's not a purist movement.
[02:41:01.235 --> 02:41:03.616]  I think he's being willfully misled, Alex.
[02:41:03.656 --> 02:41:04.416]  Here's what I know.
[02:41:04.737 --> 02:41:06.877]  I've known Donald Trump for almost 40 years.
[02:41:07.818 --> 02:41:12.720]  And when he has all the information, he almost invariably makes the right decision.
[02:41:13.340 --> 02:41:26.226]  It is only when he does not have all the information or the information that he's been given has been colored or altered or manipulated to give him a false impression that mistakes are made.
[02:41:26.926 --> 02:41:37.214]  We know for a fact that every single one of his advisors urged him to send 150,000 ground troops, boots on the ground, in Syria.
[02:41:37.794 --> 02:41:41.036]  Unfortunately, there was one man in the White House who didn't like that idea.
[02:41:41.457 --> 02:41:44.239]  One man who said, no, that's a terrible public policy.
[02:41:44.599 --> 02:41:45.660]  No, we're not doing that.
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:47.801]  That man was Donald J. Trump.
[02:41:48.361 --> 02:41:51.984]  So my confidence continues to be with the president.
[02:41:52.544 --> 02:41:55.967]  And my opposition is to those who mislead him.
[02:41:56.647 --> 02:42:02.731]  I picked up today's New York Times today to read about Ivanka Trump's agenda for the next four years.
[02:42:03.732 --> 02:42:04.953]  Ivanka had an agenda?
[02:42:05.893 --> 02:42:06.374]  Who knew?
[02:42:07.314 --> 02:42:08.315]  I saw her at the convention.
[02:42:08.355 --> 02:42:09.536]  I thought she was terrific.
[02:42:10.076 --> 02:42:10.617]  I like her.
[02:42:10.977 --> 02:42:12.138]  I think she is terrific.
[02:42:12.478 --> 02:42:15.200]  But now suddenly she's unveiling an agenda?
[02:42:16.189 --> 02:42:18.192]  Who voted for Ivanka Trump?
[02:42:18.913 --> 02:42:21.376]  Who voted for Jared Kushner?
[02:42:22.097 --> 02:42:24.640]  Who voted for any of these globalists?
[02:42:25.822 --> 02:42:28.705]  And then we have news today that Richard Grenell
[02:42:29.974 --> 02:42:35.059]  No one, I think, fought harder and more effectively for Donald Trump.
[02:42:35.119 --> 02:42:46.810]  Grinnell, a former diplomat under the Bush administration, but a guy who's come full circle, who understands the danger of the globalists, who has renounced the new world order.
[02:42:47.690 --> 02:42:48.850]  He's openly gay.
[02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:53.551]  He was one of the most effective surrogates for Donald Trump.
[02:42:54.112 --> 02:42:58.333]  It was announced that he was the president's choice to be NATO ambassador.
[02:42:58.693 --> 02:43:02.273]  It would have been a superb nomination.
[02:43:02.754 --> 02:43:08.195]  We learned today that that appointment has been mixed by Rex Tillerson.
[02:43:09.375 --> 02:43:18.743]  And I am told that it is because he objects to the fact that Grinnell, despite the fact that he is learned and distinguished in experience, is openly gay.
[02:43:19.464 --> 02:43:21.325]  Now, that's not what I voted for.
[02:43:21.345 --> 02:43:22.546]  Not me.
[02:43:23.427 --> 02:43:24.348]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:43:24.408 --> 02:43:26.390]  I don't care about your sexual orientation.
[02:43:26.910 --> 02:43:30.813]  I care about your philosophy and your experience and your qualifications.
[02:43:31.214 --> 02:43:33.155]  This is very disappointing.
[02:43:33.796 --> 02:43:37.279]  And making it even worse, Alex, is the people surrounding
[02:43:38.368 --> 02:43:39.589]  Secretary Tillerson.
[02:43:40.169 --> 02:43:41.249]  They're never Trumpers.
[02:43:41.970 --> 02:43:46.412]  The people tell him that he can't hire Grinnell, a Trump loyalist.
[02:43:47.092 --> 02:43:48.693]  They're never Trumpers.
[02:43:49.293 --> 02:44:02.940]  This is a real blow to those who understand loyalty, to those who understand the quality and the character of Rick Grinnell, a man who has earned this job, in my opinion.
[02:44:05.674 --> 02:44:08.516]  All right, that was an excerpt from our 30-hour mega broadcast.
[02:44:08.657 --> 02:44:10.398]  That was Alex Jones talking to Roger Stone.
[02:44:10.438 --> 02:44:13.681]  Roger's going to be taking over the broadcast for the fourth hour.
[02:44:13.701 --> 02:44:19.686]  I want to go back to what I was talking about earlier in the hour about the surveillance that is now being released.
[02:44:19.786 --> 02:44:22.928]  And of course, we see this news coming out all the time.
[02:44:22.969 --> 02:44:24.910]  Are people getting inoculated against this?
[02:44:25.551 --> 02:44:29.134]  We've had some more WikiLeaks documents coming out talking about
[02:44:30.267 --> 02:44:35.430]  Today, Archimedes is the latest group of revelations that we've seen from WikiLeaks.
[02:44:35.970 --> 02:44:40.032]  It's a tool used by the CIA to attack a computer inside a local area network.
[02:44:40.854 --> 02:44:50.279]  Typically what you would have in your office, for example, allows redirecting of traffic from the target computer inside the LAN through a computer infected with the malware control by the CIA.
[02:44:50.719 --> 02:44:59.643]  This technique is used by the CIA to redirect the target's computer's web browser to an exploitation server while appearing to be a normal browsing session.
[02:44:59.944 --> 02:45:08.728]  So it doesn't matter whether it's your television set that they're taking over, turning on your Samsung so they can watch and record everything that you're doing, or whether they're
[02:45:08.908 --> 02:45:14.031]  Hacking into your computers, or looking at these hacking tools that are being exposed by WikiLeaks.
[02:45:14.071 --> 02:45:15.893]  Are people being anesthetized to this?
[02:45:16.513 --> 02:45:17.834]  Certainly the CIA isn't.
[02:45:18.874 --> 02:45:21.576]  The CIA is not being anesthetized to this.
[02:45:21.596 --> 02:45:30.422]  The CIA is angry and embarrassed, but I guess they don't realize that the American public in general doesn't seem to care that we have a government that is looking at everything that we're doing.
[02:45:30.442 --> 02:45:30.962]  You ought to care.
[02:45:31.383 --> 02:45:34.625]  And the politicians who can stop this, even if the public doesn't know,
[02:45:35.445 --> 02:45:37.726]  Enough to care about where this is all headed.
[02:45:38.027 --> 02:45:40.208]  The people who need to stop this are the politicians.
[02:45:40.308 --> 02:45:42.990]  I haven't heard anybody complain about this except for Rand Paul.
[02:45:43.390 --> 02:45:56.218]  And of course what he's complaining about is this newest revelation, and it was on Drudge earlier today, about Circa exposing the fact that we have thousands of intelligence reports with unredacted names.
[02:45:56.238 --> 02:45:57.358]  Remember when it was a big deal?
[02:45:57.418 --> 02:45:58.239]  And it was a big deal.
[02:45:58.925 --> 02:46:04.949]  That members of the Trump administration, they were passing around information that they'd collected on people and they said, you didn't redact those names.
[02:46:05.350 --> 02:46:15.216]  You are supposed to redact those names if you incidentally collect information on American citizens as part of your foreign spying that we authorize you to do.
[02:46:16.017 --> 02:46:22.962]  If you incidentally collect information on people and they're not part of a criminal investigation, you have an obligation to keep that information private.
[02:46:22.982 --> 02:46:23.442]  They don't care.
[02:46:24.183 --> 02:46:25.924]  They passed around unredacted names.
[02:46:26.064 --> 02:46:28.406]  Of course, this is the Obama administration.
[02:46:29.406 --> 02:46:33.960]  The same people who are out there trying to silence anybody who disagrees with them with censorship.
[02:46:35.015 --> 02:46:42.902]  And as they're talking about this, they're asking, they reveal this, they talk about the program, the fact that there's thousands of names out there that were unredacted.
[02:46:42.922 --> 02:46:46.586]  It was made available this week by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
[02:46:46.626 --> 02:46:49.068]  This isn't something that was put out there by a whistleblower.
[02:46:49.529 --> 02:46:52.611]  This isn't something that was put out there by WikiLeaks, for example.
[02:46:52.651 --> 02:47:00.138]  This is actually a positive sign, I think, in the sense that it was put out by the Office of National Intelligence, because perhaps
[02:47:01.019 --> 02:47:04.384]  I'm just trying to read between the lines and being as optimistic as I can.
[02:47:05.065 --> 02:47:11.013]  Perhaps people in the Trump administration realize that this is now a tool of political oppression.
[02:47:12.028 --> 02:47:14.148]  That's the way that our intelligence agency is being used.
[02:47:14.168 --> 02:47:15.829]  We know that the IRS is being used that way.
[02:47:15.849 --> 02:47:20.010]  The IRS has been designed to be used that way and was used that way for decades.
[02:47:20.050 --> 02:47:24.791]  It wasn't one of the charges against Richard Nixon was that he wanted to use the IRS against his political enemies.
[02:47:25.611 --> 02:47:34.153]  The problem was, for Richard Nixon, that the then-director of the IRS had enough integrity to tell people about it, or maybe he just didn't like Richard Nixon and exposed him that way.
[02:47:35.993 --> 02:47:39.554]  Maybe he was spying on people for the Democrats, but he didn't want to do it for the Republicans.
[02:47:39.634 --> 02:47:39.934]  I don't know.
[02:47:40.094 --> 02:47:40.615]  Well, whatever.
[02:47:40.675 --> 02:47:41.335]  He didn't do it.
[02:47:41.376 --> 02:47:42.277]  He turned the list over.
[02:47:42.617 --> 02:47:44.059]  It was one of the articles of impeachment.
[02:47:44.119 --> 02:47:53.590]  But for Obama, the guy who's still there, was engaging in political activity against Tea Party groups and so forth and so on.
[02:47:53.610 --> 02:47:54.271]  But they're still there.
[02:47:55.154 --> 02:47:56.275]  People who did it for Obama.
[02:47:56.315 --> 02:47:56.735]  They did it.
[02:47:56.855 --> 02:47:57.535]  They got away with it.
[02:47:57.656 --> 02:47:58.596]  Obama didn't get impeached.
[02:47:58.656 --> 02:48:01.538]  Those people are still there in the Trump administration for the most part.
[02:48:01.878 --> 02:48:04.720]  Obama loosened privacy protections, they say.
[02:48:05.580 --> 02:48:07.902]  And, of course, a court affirmed his order.
[02:48:07.962 --> 02:48:09.282]  It's a baloney court.
[02:48:09.342 --> 02:48:11.684]  The FISA has nothing to do with a court.
[02:48:11.724 --> 02:48:14.906]  The only court that it resembles is the Star Chamber Court.
[02:48:15.546 --> 02:48:21.311]  That we had the Bill of Rights and the Magna Carta to stop from ever happening again, but nobody knows their history so they don't care.
[02:48:21.591 --> 02:48:22.952]  They allow this kind of stuff to happen.
[02:48:22.972 --> 02:48:35.804]  And you have to understand that this is purely political when they're doing this to, as I point out, journalists, clergy, lawyers, federal judge, doctors, presidential candidates, and members of Congress like Rand Paul.
[02:48:36.965 --> 02:48:38.146]  It's political, folks.
[02:48:39.090 --> 02:48:41.472]  We all know that it's there, and it has to be stopped.
[02:48:41.512 --> 02:48:48.917]  And so they're asking, this news organization that put these couple of articles out, they're asking President Trump to declassify this data, to put this out there.
[02:48:48.978 --> 02:48:50.399]  Rand Paul has asked for this as well.
[02:48:50.759 --> 02:48:53.181]  We need to expose this so that we can stop it.
[02:48:54.659 --> 02:48:56.199]  It's almost kind of a joke, you know.
[02:48:56.279 --> 02:48:57.680]  I alluded to this earlier.
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:00.201]  I got a communication from Charlie Skelton.
[02:49:00.221 --> 02:49:01.541]  He's a reporter for The Guardian.
[02:49:01.581 --> 02:49:03.461]  I met him at Bilderberg a couple of years ago.
[02:49:03.962 --> 02:49:04.722]  My wife and I met him.
[02:49:04.762 --> 02:49:06.022]  And so he sent a nice note.
[02:49:06.082 --> 02:49:08.823]  And then he put at the end of it that he's kind of a comedian.
[02:49:09.083 --> 02:49:10.483]  Actually, he was a comedian for a while.
[02:49:11.144 --> 02:49:16.525]  I realize it's a bit weird to say hi like this in a medium that's pathetically transparent to government and other surveillance.
[02:49:16.565 --> 02:49:18.366]  But hey, what can you do?
[02:49:18.746 --> 02:49:22.167]  And to the people who are reading this, really, you need to get a life.
[02:49:22.707 --> 02:49:23.207]  I'm just saying.
[02:49:23.587 --> 02:49:30.093]  Hello to a fellow journalist I met in Copenhagen a couple of years ago, and for what it's worth, InfoWars isn't the problem, but you already know that, don't you?
[02:49:30.614 --> 02:49:31.895]  You're just doing your job.
[02:49:32.275 --> 02:49:33.276]  You got assigned to do this.
[02:49:33.497 --> 02:49:34.217]  I know, I know.
[02:49:34.758 --> 02:49:39.042]  The thing is, when you joined up, is this what you imagined your job would be?
[02:49:39.142 --> 02:49:43.026]  Snooping in on private communications between two law-abiding gentlemen?
[02:49:43.717 --> 02:49:44.618]  It's not too late to quit.
[02:49:45.078 --> 02:49:46.819]  You can become an artist, a potter.
[02:49:47.399 --> 02:49:48.420]  You can open a burger joint.
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:50.001]  You know, you got a flair with food.
[02:49:50.041 --> 02:49:52.423]  Your town needs a boutique burger restaurant.
[02:49:52.443 --> 02:49:53.684]  Come on, follow your dreams.
[02:49:54.525 --> 02:49:55.865]  I do stuff like that to my wife.
[02:49:56.285 --> 02:50:03.567]  I'll talk to her and then I'll say, I'll leave a little note there to the NSA or whoever, whatever government snoop is listening to that.
[02:50:03.727 --> 02:50:06.268]  Alex has done stuff like that to me when he's sent me messages.
[02:50:06.788 --> 02:50:07.628]  We know you're listening.
[02:50:08.228 --> 02:50:08.908]  We're journalists.
[02:50:09.488 --> 02:50:10.389]  We cover these.
[02:50:10.709 --> 02:50:11.609]  We're paying attention.
[02:50:12.149 --> 02:50:15.170]  We're trying to get the American public to know that you're listening to us.
[02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:17.590]  We're trying to get the American public to pay attention.
[02:50:17.890 --> 02:50:20.291]  And we're trying to get the politicians to pay attention.
[02:50:21.294 --> 02:50:26.468]  Because as Donald Trump hopefully knows by now, this is a political weapon.
[02:50:27.503 --> 02:50:34.769]  This is a weapon to be used against the populace, but it will be used first and foremost, as we've always said, against the politicians.
[02:50:35.389 --> 02:50:37.611]  They will be the ones up against the wall first.
[02:50:38.331 --> 02:50:48.859]  The people who have the power to change this, the current Congress, the current President, are the ones that are going to be the victims of this if they don't do it.
[02:50:48.900 --> 02:50:50.421]  They need to do it for everybody.
[02:50:50.461 --> 02:50:51.842]  You've seen it used against yourself.
[02:50:52.342 --> 02:50:55.689]  You need to do this for yourself, for everyone in America.
[02:50:55.749 --> 02:50:56.972]  Stand up for the Bill of Rights.
[02:50:57.012 --> 02:50:58.215]  Stand up for our privacy.
[02:50:58.235 --> 02:50:58.595]  Stay with us.
[02:50:58.615 --> 02:50:59.156]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:05.638 --> 02:51:07.438]  This is Thomas Friedman, New York Times.
[02:51:07.498 --> 02:51:09.839]  He writes that Trump should not fight ISIS.
[02:51:11.039 --> 02:51:17.641]  Quote, the same way we encouraged the Mujahideen fighters to bleed Russia in Afghanistan.
[02:51:18.041 --> 02:51:25.023]  So you have a major New York Times writer openly calling for Trump to leave ISIS alone.
[02:51:25.043 --> 02:51:30.864]  I mean, Lionel, why is the establishment, which after all, you know, embraced this attack on Assad last week,
[02:51:31.404 --> 02:51:32.125]  They loved it!
[02:51:32.525 --> 02:51:39.249]  They immediately forgave Trump for many of his sins in the immediate aftermath of this Tomahawk missile attack.
[02:51:39.769 --> 02:51:46.754]  Why are they now openly encouraging him to allow the spread of a jihadist army that has terrorized an entire continent?
[02:51:47.594 --> 02:51:52.197]  Well, let me see if I can give you an adult and a cogent answer, because they're stupid!
[02:51:53.174 --> 02:51:56.135]  Because Americans are, no, no, stupid!
[02:51:56.835 --> 02:51:59.956]  Don't read, don't care, don't wonder.
[02:51:59.976 --> 02:52:01.437]  They're incurious.
[02:52:01.957 --> 02:52:03.677]  They know more about sports.
[02:52:03.737 --> 02:52:10.359]  They knew more about Tom Brady's under-inflated footballs than they do what's going on.
[02:52:10.619 --> 02:52:19.442]  In this article, he basically admits and explains that ISIS is a tool, a tool.
[02:52:19.522 --> 02:52:21.023]  He writes in there,
[02:52:22.079 --> 02:52:23.669]  That basically is an inside job.
[02:52:23.730 --> 02:52:25.440]  It's basically like professional wrestling.
[02:52:26.573 --> 02:52:27.634]  And nobody says anything.
[02:52:28.574 --> 02:52:29.655]  This was a test.
[02:52:30.055 --> 02:52:33.738]  This was to say, my God, do they read us?
[02:52:34.158 --> 02:52:35.259]  Do they care about us?
[02:52:35.579 --> 02:52:37.040]  Is anybody paying attention to us?
[02:52:37.220 --> 02:52:38.781]  Or do they just not know?
[02:52:39.181 --> 02:52:42.364]  I mean, Paul, I'm still reeling from that.
[02:52:42.864 --> 02:52:49.288]  I can't believe he was allowed to say that, frame that.
[02:52:50.209 --> 02:52:53.831]  That is the blueprint of what's going on.
[02:52:54.091 --> 02:52:55.552]  This is amazing.
[02:52:55.652 --> 02:52:56.093]  And also,
[02:52:56.973 --> 02:52:59.055]  I was doing a radio show this morning, to give an example.
[02:52:59.536 --> 02:53:01.678]  And I'm sure you've done this too, because people think I'm nuts!
[02:53:02.379 --> 02:53:07.564]  Could be for different reasons, but I say, well, you do realize that there are a lot of people, myself included.
[02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:12.611]  Who believed that the whole gas act was basically a false flag.
[02:53:13.291 --> 02:53:16.852]  That it was contrived, it was staged, it was orchestrated, as it was in 2013.
[02:53:17.552 --> 02:53:21.073]  CYHR said this, we have evidence of this, we know it, it's part of their MO.
[02:53:21.793 --> 02:53:22.914]  And you could hear the crickets!
[02:53:22.974 --> 02:53:24.694]  It was like somebody said, cue the crickets!
[02:53:24.714 --> 02:53:26.534]  And I said, did you hear what I said?
[02:53:26.875 --> 02:53:28.095]  Where the hell have you been?
[02:53:28.675 --> 02:53:30.476]  Paul, am I living in a parallel universe?
[02:53:30.676 --> 02:53:37.319]  Have you and Alex and others deluded me into thinking that somehow everybody knows what we know?
[02:53:37.699 --> 02:53:44.242]  Am I walking around in some kind of a cosmic psychotic fugue where... am I the only one?
[02:53:44.262 --> 02:53:46.123]  I'm not talking to a guy in a corner.
[02:53:46.443 --> 02:53:54.106]  I'm talking to a newspaper, a radio host who says, well, did you see the pictures of the dead babies?
[02:53:54.146 --> 02:53:55.407]  And the dead say, yes!
[02:53:57.352 --> 02:53:58.833]  That's the thing, Lionel, over and over again.
[02:53:58.853 --> 02:54:02.175]  It's this appeal to sentimentality and emotion.
[02:54:07.979 --> 02:54:11.342]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:11.362 --> 02:54:12.022]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:12.062 --> 02:54:14.384]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by Roger Stone.
[02:54:14.404 --> 02:54:15.985]  He'll be doing the fourth hour for us today.
[02:54:16.005 --> 02:54:21.249]  I want to take a look at where this change in Obamacare is headed after it passed the House.
[02:54:21.969 --> 02:54:25.532]  Of course, Donald Trump has signaled his intention to sign it, but the
[02:54:26.653 --> 02:54:28.915]  The hitch here is in the Senate.
[02:54:28.975 --> 02:54:33.920]  And as I said before, I want to see this whole structure, this framework of mandates taken down.
[02:54:33.940 --> 02:54:36.042]  But I think they've made some good steps in that direction.
[02:54:36.983 --> 02:54:40.326]  And like I said, I want to see the income tax abolished.
[02:54:40.426 --> 02:54:45.131]  But I would also applaud if somebody cuts the tax rates significantly.
[02:54:45.612 --> 02:54:48.554]  So we have to be willing to take the
[02:54:49.355 --> 02:54:50.676]  That's the logic of the Democrats.
[02:55:13.184 --> 02:55:14.504]  So let's take those taxes off.
[02:55:14.564 --> 02:55:18.245]  Let's try to make a few moves towards an open marketplace.
[02:55:18.285 --> 02:55:22.887]  Let's take away the powers of the HHS dictator.
[02:55:22.947 --> 02:55:25.027]  We don't need a health czar in Washington.
[02:55:25.047 --> 02:55:27.748]  That's one of the things that's still there that really concerns me.
[02:55:27.768 --> 02:55:30.829]  They're looking at that as a tool of reform.
[02:55:30.909 --> 02:55:32.289]  That's a very dangerous thing.
[02:55:32.889 --> 02:55:36.790]  That's like Boromir putting on the Ring of Power and Lord of the Rings and thinking that's going to work out.
[02:55:36.830 --> 02:55:39.611]  But let's take a look at what the Senate is going to do now.
[02:55:40.387 --> 02:55:46.197]  We've got an article from Politico saying the Senate GOP is rejecting the House Obamacare bill.
[02:55:47.019 --> 02:55:53.149]  As we see from Lindsey Graham, he says, like y'all, I'm still waiting to see if it's a boy or a girl.
[02:55:54.178 --> 02:55:55.019]  Yeah, Lindsey, we know.
[02:55:55.039 --> 02:55:57.001]  We're still waiting to find out what you are.
[02:55:57.722 --> 02:55:58.863]  Let us know when you make up your mind.
[02:56:00.084 --> 02:56:10.155]  Anyway, we have another quote from Bob Corker who says, I turned the volume off some time ago and I have no idea what the house is passing.
[02:56:10.195 --> 02:56:11.096]  He really doesn't care.
[02:56:11.116 --> 02:56:12.838]  And we know all about Bob Corker.
[02:56:13.519 --> 02:56:18.321]  We've had Jerome Corsi talk about the way that this is funded, stealing from investors.
[02:56:18.641 --> 02:56:21.422]  And he did an article specifically about Bob Corker.
[02:56:21.883 --> 02:56:23.223]  He did this back on April 19th.
[02:56:23.243 --> 02:56:27.865]  He said, a GOP senator gets rich blocking Obamacare repeals.
[02:56:28.465 --> 02:56:30.186]  And he was talking about you, Bob Corker.
[02:56:30.906 --> 02:56:33.728]  And this is the same guy who says, I have no idea what the House passed.
[02:56:34.428 --> 02:56:36.209]  He says, I turned off the volume a long time ago.
[02:56:36.229 --> 02:56:36.949]  He just doesn't care.
[02:56:36.989 --> 02:56:37.849]  He doesn't want it to pass.
[02:56:37.889 --> 02:56:39.010]  He's making money off of this.
[02:56:40.035 --> 02:56:42.077]  And that's the way it is with a lot of these people.
[02:56:42.117 --> 02:56:50.884]  Meanwhile, we've got another GOP senator, and this is very important, too, because, folks, with a reconciliation process, they need 51 votes.
[02:56:51.705 --> 02:56:53.486]  There's only 52 Republicans.
[02:56:53.786 --> 02:57:02.573]  And if we've got people like Bob Corker, who's getting rich off of blocking Obamacare, and if we've got people like Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, saying the Senate
[02:57:03.479 --> 02:57:07.560]  The plan to repeal and replace Obamacare must pass the Jimmy Kimmel test.
[02:57:08.220 --> 02:57:10.561]  Does that mean it has to have a lot of BS added to it?
[02:57:10.581 --> 02:57:11.861]  A lot of propaganda?
[02:57:12.141 --> 02:57:13.901]  Because that's what Jimmy Kimmel was doing.
[02:57:13.921 --> 02:57:17.802]  And of course, it's not just a GOP senator saying, we've got to have the Jimmy Kimmel test.
[02:57:17.842 --> 02:57:28.985]  And of course, he's referring to the fact that Jimmy Kimmel got on television, carefully talked about the severe health issue, the emergency open heart surgery that needed to be performed on his newborn child.
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:34.282]  And then tried to spin that into a case for Obamacare.
[02:57:34.802 --> 02:57:36.803]  And of course Obama jumped on that the next day.
[02:57:36.863 --> 02:57:43.126]  Obama turns Jimmy Kimmel's story about his 10-day-old son's open-heart surgery into an Obamacare plug.
[02:57:44.527 --> 02:57:46.168]  Yeah, just getting on television.
[02:57:46.188 --> 02:57:47.128]  This is where they are.
[02:57:47.168 --> 02:57:48.148]  They have to get people.
[02:57:48.849 --> 02:57:52.711]  They can't win the narrative with facts and with debate.
[02:57:52.771 --> 02:57:56.813]  So what they do is they get late-night talk show comedians to push their agenda now.
[02:57:57.473 --> 02:57:58.233]  People like Colbert.
[02:57:58.453 --> 02:57:59.314]  People like Jimmy Kimmel.
[02:58:00.188 --> 02:58:01.930]  Talking about the heart disease.
[02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:05.633]  The Daily Wire had a couple of good articles that came back.
[02:58:06.073 --> 02:58:18.984]  Some tweets and quotes from Ben Shapiro, who interestingly enough had a child, he had a daughter, who had to have the same surgery, had it at the same hospital with the same doctor.
[02:58:19.164 --> 02:58:24.869]  It was a private charity hospital that does pay for this if people don't have any insurance.
[02:58:24.929 --> 02:58:27.371]  And if you had insurance, it wouldn't have been excluded with
[02:58:27.911 --> 02:58:29.312]  A pre-existing condition.
[02:58:29.613 --> 02:58:32.455]  They call total BS on what Jimmy Kimmel did.
[02:58:32.475 --> 02:58:36.038]  But of course, if you're in Venezuela, you can't even get food, let alone open heart surgery.
[02:58:36.298 --> 02:58:37.439]  That's where socialism leads.
[02:58:37.820 --> 02:58:38.260]  Stay with us.
[02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:40.982]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us in the next hour.
[02:58:41.002 --> 02:58:44.906]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.307 --> 02:58:47.107]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:57.461 --> 02:58:58.962]  There is a crisis in America today.
[02:58:59.422 --> 02:59:01.824]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[02:59:02.124 --> 02:59:09.528]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[02:59:09.928 --> 02:59:13.530]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[02:59:13.550 --> 02:59:15.011]  I have the answer for you today.
[02:59:15.431 --> 02:59:16.592]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[02:59:17.352 --> 02:59:22.656]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone in its safe, no-radiation compartment.
[02:59:23.096 --> 02:59:28.840]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[02:59:29.681 --> 02:59:32.162]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[02:59:32.342 --> 02:59:38.306]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[02:59:39.087 --> 02:59:40.728]  With a blocking pocket, this is impossible.
[02:59:40.848 --> 02:59:43.870]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[02:59:44.210 --> 02:59:52.654]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own blocking pocket.
[02:59:54.576 --> 03:00:00.479]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.804 --> 03:00:13.312]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:13.893 --> 03:00:15.597]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:48.899 --> 03:01:04.490]  Alex Jones, and what you see on your screen is a little slideshow we put together to outline for you the national campaign of censorship that is being unleashed against Infowars.com, Stone Cold Truth.com,
[03:01:05.170 --> 03:01:13.775]  Mike Cernovich, Breitbart, Daily Caller, and so many other liberty-oriented alternative news organizations.
[03:01:14.796 --> 03:01:18.718]  This is perhaps the greatest challenge that we face.
[03:01:19.739 --> 03:01:24.321]  It is a fundamental fight over free speech and a free press.
[03:01:25.322 --> 03:01:30.385]  A free press is crucial for the survival of our democracy.
[03:01:31.328 --> 03:01:38.011]  Joining us later on the show, we have Jacob Engels, the editor and publisher of the Central Florida Post.
[03:01:38.051 --> 03:01:53.797]  He has just broken big news on George Soros and his criminal enterprises, and is feeling the full brunt of the efforts to censor the terrific website, the Central Florida Post.
[03:01:54.457 --> 03:02:14.223]  We're also going to be joined by Dr. Franklin Brothers, who is an internet expert, who's going to break down for us exactly how Google and Facebook and Yahoo and Twitter and Amazon are seeking to kneecap free expression on the internet.
[03:02:14.463 --> 03:02:19.625]  How they are seeking to close InfoWars.com, Stone Cold Truth.
[03:02:20.305 --> 03:02:29.172]  Stonezone.com, Breitbart, and so many fine investigative journalism sites down and put us out of business.
[03:02:29.933 --> 03:02:41.783]  You see, they would like to return to the days when ABC and NBC and CBS and CNN and Fox had an absolute stranglehold
[03:02:42.734 --> 03:02:46.896]  Indeed, a monopoly on political dissemination in this country.
[03:02:47.536 --> 03:02:50.177]  If it didn't happen there, it didn't happen.
[03:02:50.837 --> 03:03:04.202]  But the technological advances of millions of Americans now getting their political news from a handheld computer device, or an iPad, or even a PC, opened the door to the Internet.
[03:03:04.842 --> 03:03:06.543]  And the Internet opened the door
[03:03:08.291 --> 03:03:16.993]  To Infowars.com and a dozen other revolutionary sites like it, where the truth can be found.
[03:03:18.213 --> 03:03:31.155]  Now, it was my honor to participate in the 30-hour marathon only, I guess, a day ago, to bring public attention to the fact that we are under attack like never before.
[03:03:32.375 --> 03:03:35.856]  They seek to silence us, to close us down, to seal our lips.
[03:03:36.650 --> 03:03:44.032]  Which is why your support for InfoWars through the InfoWarsStore.com is crucial.
[03:03:44.972 --> 03:03:53.335]  Now you've heard me talk on this program many times about the fact that one of the products there that I am particularly fond of is BrainForce.
[03:03:54.412 --> 03:04:04.023]  I find after long hours and many hours in front of the computer or even many hours traveling that this fine product brings me mental clarity.
[03:04:04.644 --> 03:04:09.970]  In fact, I would go so far to say as it brings me some mental energy.
[03:04:11.147 --> 03:04:24.706]  And right now, this formula, which is loaded with natural compounds, like Yerba Mate, L-Theanine, Alpha, GPC, and a number of other all-natural
[03:04:26.288 --> 03:04:27.889]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll be right back.
[03:05:03.007 --> 03:05:10.772]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:05:10.992 --> 03:05:17.416]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:05:17.636 --> 03:05:25.921]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:05:26.201 --> 03:05:34.949]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:40.935]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:05:41.295 --> 03:05:41.775]  It works!
[03:05:42.055 --> 03:05:50.379]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[03:05:50.519 --> 03:05:59.922]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.
[03:06:00.262 --> 03:06:00.763]  A total 360 win!
[03:06:09.850 --> 03:06:11.733]  Infowars wouldn't exist without you.
[03:06:11.813 --> 03:06:13.055]  You are the Infowar.
[03:06:13.275 --> 03:06:20.526]  During that 30-plus hour live transmission that kicked off Wednesday and ran right through Thursday, we saw massive, massive support.
[03:06:20.806 --> 03:06:24.271]  Spreading the word, spreading the articles, and our free newsletters.
[03:06:24.311 --> 03:06:25.373]  We can stay in contact.
[03:06:25.453 --> 03:06:26.154]  It's been amazing.
[03:06:26.314 --> 03:06:34.182]  That's why I'm going to go ahead and extend some of the biggest sales we've had in six months right through this weekend, right through until Monday morning.
[03:06:34.543 --> 03:06:46.776]  We have a giant 30% off discount on ProPure King water filters, the big, nice tabletop stainless steel Rolls-Royce model that cuts out all the garbage but leaves the good minerals in.
[03:06:47.236 --> 03:06:52.504]  We've got 30% off our amazing Nootropic, and of course that's Brain Force.
[03:06:52.524 --> 03:06:54.707]  That's going to be selling out very, very soon.
[03:06:54.967 --> 03:06:58.832]  More is coming in the next few weeks, but I will keep that discounted until it sells out.
[03:06:59.053 --> 03:07:00.935]  That may come before Monday.
[03:07:01.276 --> 03:07:04.039]  20% off our methylcobalamin, pure organic.
[03:07:04.620 --> 03:07:07.464]  Vitamin B12, that's so amazing, you take under the tongue.
[03:07:08.225 --> 03:07:16.495]  20% off winter sun, the vitamin D3, that I take also in the summer as well, but it's essential in the winter, because that's how you produce vitamin D mainly, is through the sun on your skin.
[03:07:16.876 --> 03:07:18.538]  Prostagard, an amazing formula.
[03:07:18.558 --> 03:07:19.519]  20% off.
[03:07:20.260 --> 03:07:22.783]  20% off Bio PCA for the skin and the nails.
[03:07:23.724 --> 03:07:24.505]  And so much more.
[03:07:24.905 --> 03:07:25.705]  Biome Defense.
[03:07:26.406 --> 03:07:28.767]  The 25 billion cultures per pill.
[03:07:29.428 --> 03:07:30.028]  Amazing.
[03:07:30.088 --> 03:07:30.868]  Game-changing.
[03:07:30.949 --> 03:07:31.729]  Tip of the spear.
[03:07:32.229 --> 03:07:34.210]  Very best out there from our years of research.
[03:07:34.431 --> 03:07:35.331]  From the top labs.
[03:07:35.491 --> 03:07:38.473]  Then of course we have Living Defense Parasite Cleanse.
[03:07:38.513 --> 03:07:38.773]  That's 20% off.
[03:07:40.034 --> 03:07:44.355]  We have DNA Force that's back in stock for a limited time, and much, much more.
[03:07:44.375 --> 03:07:45.596]  There's a lot of other specials.
[03:07:45.756 --> 03:07:53.118]  It's all there at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or you can call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:07:53.138 --> 03:07:58.159]  So for myself, Alex Jones, and the InfoWars family, I want to thank you, because you are family.
[03:08:06.443 --> 03:08:16.846]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:08:17.406 --> 03:08:19.046]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:08:25.228 --> 03:08:25.868]  Welcome back.
[03:08:26.649 --> 03:08:33.092]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones, and proud to be here.
[03:08:33.732 --> 03:08:47.739]  Some breaking news, as the Washington Post reported only minutes ago, I have been contacted, along with Paul Manafort, General Mike Flynn, and this fellow Carter Page, who I don't know,
[03:08:49.039 --> 03:08:51.601]  And we have been contacted by both the U.S.
[03:08:51.661 --> 03:09:13.732]  Senate and the House Intelligence Committees who appear to be prepared to negotiate the conditions for public testimony on the bogus question of Russian interference in American elections and collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian state.
[03:09:14.532 --> 03:09:17.454]  Let me say again for those of you who are just tuning in.
[03:09:18.371 --> 03:09:22.437]  I am anxious, indeed ready, to testify in public.
[03:09:23.037 --> 03:09:32.650]  Senators Feinstein and Warner and Franken have specifically lied about me, but they seem to be confused.
[03:09:33.291 --> 03:09:42.158]  Yesterday, Senator Feinstein repeated the canard that I knew about the hacking of John Podesta's email in advance.
[03:09:42.799 --> 03:09:51.445]  She repeated the lie that I had advance notice of the contents of WikiLeaks' disclosures against Hillary.
[03:09:52.146 --> 03:09:59.191]  And then hours later, she gave an interview on CNN in which she admitted that there was no evidence whatsoever.
[03:10:00.032 --> 03:10:02.833]  Of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.
[03:10:03.653 --> 03:10:08.074]  So, Senator Feinstein, I know you're in, what, your 80th term?
[03:10:08.474 --> 03:10:11.315]  And perhaps you're slipping, but which is it?
[03:10:11.915 --> 03:10:15.436]  Either there is evidence, or there is not.
[03:10:15.496 --> 03:10:21.097]  You see, words matter, Senator, and your words matter.
[03:10:22.165 --> 03:10:24.247]  In any event, we'll keep you updated on that.
[03:10:24.827 --> 03:10:26.549]  I have requested no immunity.
[03:10:27.450 --> 03:10:32.033]  I only require that my testimony be in public.
[03:10:33.154 --> 03:10:42.883]  And I am anxious to take those senators on and take their exact words and parse them in a search for the truth.
[03:10:43.976 --> 03:10:54.821]  Now joining us is my colleague Jacob Engels of the Central Florida Post, which is a fledging libertarian-oriented news site.
[03:10:55.641 --> 03:10:59.923]  Jacob Engels, welcome to InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:00.704 --> 03:11:02.545]  Thank you so much for having me on, Roger.
[03:11:02.565 --> 03:11:07.547]  I try and support InfoWars as much as I can, and it's great to be here as a guest.
[03:11:08.823 --> 03:11:14.909]  So, Jacob, you have been really out there in the last couple weeks.
[03:11:14.949 --> 03:11:17.432]  You've broken some major stories.
[03:11:18.633 --> 03:11:29.964]  But what we're going to focus on today is not just the incredible stories you have broken, but how immediately in the aftermath of those journalistic breakthroughs,
[03:11:30.845 --> 03:11:42.469]  Facebook, Google, and the other internet giants have moved swiftly to snuff you, to cut off your public access, to bury the stories.
[03:11:42.489 --> 03:11:44.489]  Let's start with Rollins College.
[03:11:45.170 --> 03:11:52.612]  Walk us through what you learned there, and then what happened to you once you posted the fruits of your investigative journalism.
[03:11:53.740 --> 03:11:54.040]  Sure!
[03:11:54.380 --> 03:12:06.067]  So at Rollins College we had a radical Islamic professor who proclaimed in class that the crucifixion was a hoax, that Jesus' disciples did not believe that he was divine.
[03:12:06.467 --> 03:12:09.269]  In any event, a Christian student stood up to that professor.
[03:12:09.529 --> 03:12:17.374]  She then issued a revenge grade and started a whole series of events which resulted in the student's suspension, her filing a false police report,
[03:12:18.074 --> 03:12:18.354]  I think?
[03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:49.728]  Media Matters trolls and other people that have attacked InfoWars and Stone Cold Truth and immediately our content started to disappear from the top search results while we were having more shares than any other content.
[03:12:49.788 --> 03:12:53.310]  So that's what happened at Rollins College and it's still developing.
[03:12:53.330 --> 03:13:03.136]  We're investigating, Professor, but Google, Facebook, the mainstream media, the globalist controllers who want to censor information
[03:13:03.888 --> 03:13:05.489]  Took a shot at us on a local level.
[03:13:05.529 --> 03:13:07.731]  So it's happening all across the board.
[03:13:08.732 --> 03:13:13.956]  Now, incredibly, you also broke a major story regarding George Soros.
[03:13:14.997 --> 03:13:23.004]  And as I recall, it pertained to his funding of a local Florida prosecutor who seems to be doing his dirty work.
[03:13:23.685 --> 03:13:30.490]  And then what really amazed me is in the immediate aftermath of your breaking this carefully documented story,
[03:13:31.391 --> 03:13:35.572]  You were threatened by Soros's thugs yourself, directly.
[03:13:35.732 --> 03:13:38.473]  Usually, they kind of hide behind others.
[03:13:38.533 --> 03:13:57.119]  Their front organization of monkeys at Media Matters for America, a criminal enterprise, whose finances should be examined for their tax cheating and their violation of their non-profit status to do hardcore political work.
[03:13:58.339 --> 03:14:09.046]  Believe me, if the shoe were on the other foot, if Media Matters were a conservative or a pro-liberty organization, the IRS would be on them like a cheap suit.
[03:14:09.307 --> 03:14:17.192]  But in this case, lay out for us what you learned, how you reported it, and then what the results were.
[03:14:18.231 --> 03:14:25.437]  So George Soros funded this state attorney in Orange, Osceola County to the tune of 1.3 million dollars in the 2016 election.
[03:14:25.997 --> 03:14:31.482]  She wins, and then all of a sudden she announces that she's going to be anti-death penalty.
[03:14:31.522 --> 03:14:33.103]  She's not going to charge death penalty.
[03:14:33.483 --> 03:14:35.165]  And that's when we started investigating.
[03:14:35.185 --> 03:14:42.931]  We found that Soros had not stopped supporting her when the election ended, but in fact funded a group that
[03:14:43.593 --> 03:14:59.506]  Helped her ex-villain husband get a job, funded a group that is providing the talking points to the state attorney for free in a very expensive service and company, telling her how to skirt the issue about death penalty, how to talk to the media.
[03:14:59.546 --> 03:15:04.731]  So we exposed all of this and connected the dots and put it in a very clear timeline.
[03:15:05.411 --> 03:15:12.156]  And to my surprise, I began getting emails from George Soros' PR people demanding it be taken down.
[03:15:12.256 --> 03:15:13.477]  You will take this down.
[03:15:13.757 --> 03:15:15.538]  You will issue a retraction.
[03:15:15.958 --> 03:15:23.143]  And I said, no, you can answer a few questions, or Mr. Soros can submit an op-ed, and that's how we're going to do it.
[03:15:23.503 --> 03:15:28.087]  And they kept demanding, demanding, demanding, and I finally got fed up with it.
[03:15:28.327 --> 03:15:29.888]  I did a live video on Facebook.
[03:15:30.368 --> 03:15:44.018]  And said we will not retract, we will not take it down, because if you let him bully and if you let him do this to me, just like when they're trying to do it to you, to Alex Jones, to a whole InfoWars audience, we cannot let them do it.
[03:15:44.298 --> 03:15:49.302]  Because if they get one opportunity, they're just going to keep going and going and going.
[03:15:50.583 --> 03:15:52.645]  You know, this is really amazing to me.
[03:15:53.085 --> 03:15:54.286]  Jacobs, how old are you? 25.
[03:15:56.721 --> 03:16:14.728]  So here you have a libertarian, independent investigative journalist whose website, the Central Florida Post, previously known as the East Orlando Post, is a powerhouse, and who over the last several years has broken some of the major stories in Florida politics.
[03:16:14.849 --> 03:16:20.071]  And now, suddenly, you have drawn the ire of George Soros.
[03:16:20.911 --> 03:16:27.899]  Who, instead of hiding behind one of his thugs, is actually, in this case, threatening you directly.
[03:16:28.619 --> 03:16:35.186]  This is a, what I would say, a perfect case study of what we're up against.
[03:16:35.867 --> 03:16:41.873]  This is why I have worked with others to form FreeOurInternet.org.
[03:16:43.054 --> 03:16:53.939]  Free Our Internet is a duly filed non-profit that is going to be calling out the internet giants, the so-called tech left.
[03:16:54.559 --> 03:16:55.599]  Let's say who this is.
[03:16:56.299 --> 03:16:57.340]  It's Yahoo.
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:16:59.341]  It's Amazon.
[03:16:59.761 --> 03:17:00.901]  It's Google.
[03:17:01.421 --> 03:17:02.742]  It's Facebook.
[03:17:03.302 --> 03:17:04.323]  It's Twitter.
[03:17:04.963 --> 03:17:07.044]  And they seek to strangle us.
[03:17:07.544 --> 03:17:09.645]  They seek to silence us.
[03:17:10.425 --> 03:17:14.849]  We at Free Our Internet are not going to stand for it.
[03:17:15.549 --> 03:17:26.438]  And we will organize to appeal to the Trump Justice Department for an antitrust action against those who would limit our free speech.
[03:17:27.419 --> 03:17:37.646]  Or we will put together a class action suit, by far a more expensive and difficult route, but one we will pursue if that is what it takes.
[03:17:38.306 --> 03:17:56.799]  But more importantly, to educate the American people so that individual voters and individual viewers go to their congressmen, go to their senators, go to the White House with their messages to let them know that we are not going to stand
[03:17:57.639 --> 03:18:01.481]  For putting the toothpaste back in the tube.
[03:18:02.461 --> 03:18:19.167]  Speaking of toothpaste, and Jacob I want you to stay with me for a part of the next segment if you would, but speaking of toothpaste, there is a way right now where you can help the fight for freedom and support the important work we're doing here at InfoWars.
[03:18:19.707 --> 03:18:23.249]  That's right, it's the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:31.151]  Anyone who knows Mrs. Stone or has seen her photo knows she has a gleaming white style.
[03:18:31.651 --> 03:18:44.495]  And she's tried all of the whitening toothpastes, all of the presumably holistic and all-natural toothpastes, and she loves Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste.
[03:18:45.675 --> 03:18:47.137]  You can have a win-win here.
[03:18:47.558 --> 03:19:01.395]  You can get this, which is, in all honesty, only back in stock for a limited time, and you can grab this great product for $9.95 and support the fight for freedom.
[03:19:02.222 --> 03:19:03.784]  What could be clearer?
[03:19:04.124 --> 03:19:09.250]  So grab your fluoride-free toothpaste, bubblegum, or peppermint.
[03:19:09.811 --> 03:19:11.252]  I personally prefer the peppermint.
[03:19:11.733 --> 03:19:12.694]  But do it today.
[03:19:13.234 --> 03:19:20.242]  Because we need your support here at InfoWars.com in the fight for journalistic freedom.
[03:19:20.903 --> 03:19:22.365]  This is a fundamental fight.
[03:19:23.618 --> 03:19:26.444]  Over the freedom of the press and the First Amendment.
[03:19:26.864 --> 03:19:31.513]  And you can support it by going to theinfowarsstore.com now.
[03:19:32.054 --> 03:19:34.700]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll be right back.
[03:20:10.293 --> 03:20:12.174]  InfoWars wouldn't exist without you.
[03:20:12.254 --> 03:20:13.515]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:20:13.735 --> 03:20:20.958]  During that 30-plus hour live transmission that kicked off Wednesday and ran right through Thursday, we saw massive, massive support.
[03:20:21.238 --> 03:20:24.700]  Spreading the word, spreading the articles, and our free newsletters.
[03:20:24.740 --> 03:20:25.801]  We can stay in contact.
[03:20:25.881 --> 03:20:26.581]  It's been amazing.
[03:20:26.761 --> 03:20:34.649]  That's why I'm going to go ahead and extend some of the biggest sales we've had in six months right through this weekend, right through until Monday morning.
[03:20:35.010 --> 03:20:47.223]  We have a giant 30% off discount on ProPure King water filters, the big, nice tabletop stainless steel Rolls-Royce model that cuts out all the garbage but leaves the good minerals in.
[03:20:47.683 --> 03:20:52.950]  We've got 30% off our amazing Nootropic, and of course that's Brain Force.
[03:20:52.990 --> 03:20:55.153]  That's going to be selling out very, very soon.
[03:20:55.433 --> 03:20:59.279]  More is coming in the next few weeks, but I will keep that discounted until it sells out.
[03:20:59.499 --> 03:21:00.720]  That may come before Monday.
[03:21:01.381 --> 03:21:04.485]  20% off our methylcobalamin, pure organic.
[03:21:05.066 --> 03:21:08.390]  Vitamin B12, that's so amazing, you take under the tongue.
[03:21:08.670 --> 03:21:16.940]  20% off winter sun, the vitamin D3, that I take also in the summer as well, but it's essential in the winter, because that's how you produce vitamin D mainly, is through the sun on your skin.
[03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:18.982]  Prostagard, an amazing formula.
[03:21:19.423 --> 03:21:19.963]  20% off.
[03:21:20.444 --> 03:21:23.227]  20% off Bio PCA for the skin and the nails.
[03:21:24.188 --> 03:21:24.948]  And so much more.
[03:21:25.369 --> 03:21:26.169]  Biome Defense.
[03:21:26.849 --> 03:21:29.210]  The 25 billion cultures per pill.
[03:21:29.871 --> 03:21:30.471]  Amazing.
[03:21:30.531 --> 03:21:31.311]  Game-changing.
[03:21:31.391 --> 03:21:32.171]  Tip of the spear.
[03:21:32.672 --> 03:21:35.773]  Very best out there from our years of research from the top labs.
[03:21:35.953 --> 03:21:38.914]  Then of course we have Living Defense Parasite Cleanse.
[03:21:38.954 --> 03:21:39.214]  That's 20% off.
[03:21:40.475 --> 03:21:44.798]  We have DNA Force that's back in stock for a limited time, and much, much more.
[03:21:44.838 --> 03:21:46.038]  There's a lot of other specials.
[03:21:46.218 --> 03:21:53.563]  It's all there at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or you can call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:21:53.603 --> 03:21:58.626]  So for myself, Alex Jones, and the InfoWars family, I want to thank you, because you are family.
[03:22:13.183 --> 03:22:21.113]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[03:22:21.173 --> 03:22:24.257]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[03:22:25.066 --> 03:22:26.927]  And they're also very affordable.
[03:22:49.053 --> 03:22:55.801]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[03:22:56.202 --> 03:22:56.962]  It's a win-win.
[03:22:57.423 --> 03:22:58.464]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:23:06.293 --> 03:23:07.695]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[03:23:07.755 --> 03:23:09.017]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:23:09.966 --> 03:23:10.326]  Great.
[03:23:10.426 --> 03:23:11.427]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:23:11.547 --> 03:23:15.930]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:23:16.090 --> 03:23:17.631]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[03:23:17.771 --> 03:23:25.176]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:23:25.196 --> 03:23:25.916]  Wow, thank you.
[03:23:25.936 --> 03:23:28.478]  You're on top of the list that makes it all possible.
[03:23:28.498 --> 03:23:30.159]  Which Nutraceuticals do you like best?
[03:23:30.399 --> 03:23:33.720]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:23:33.880 --> 03:23:34.240]  That's amazing.
[03:23:34.260 --> 03:23:34.921]  That's really incredible.
[03:23:35.141 --> 03:23:38.182]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:23:38.202 --> 03:23:39.462]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[03:23:39.562 --> 03:23:41.143]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:23:41.203 --> 03:23:42.343]  And I love you guys.
[03:23:42.363 --> 03:23:43.864]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[03:23:44.624 --> 03:23:51.327]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:23:51.467 --> 03:23:52.267]  You will love it.
[03:23:52.507 --> 03:23:52.967]  I'm telling you.
[03:23:53.007 --> 03:23:54.348]  I've never bought a bad product.
[03:23:54.648 --> 03:23:59.036]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[03:23:59.076 --> 03:24:00.719]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[03:24:18.908 --> 03:24:22.830]  Welcome back to InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:39.159]  I'm Roger Stone sitting in for my friend Alex Jones and our subject today, our focus, is internet censorship and the stranglehold that the tech giants are attempting to reassert on free expression in this country.
[03:24:39.799 --> 03:24:44.762]  Now, we have obtained the Twitter shadow ban list.
[03:24:45.776 --> 03:25:02.473]  For the time being, this is only a partial list of the most notorious accounts that are being monitored on a daily basis and whose algorithms are being manipulated to limit our reach, our reposts, and our retweets.
[03:25:03.354 --> 03:25:10.742]  The list appears to have been created more through an algorithm process using filters rather than using buzzwords.
[03:25:11.743 --> 03:25:24.035]  And if a person on the list is low priority, it will take 15 to 20 seconds once it runs through the programmed buzzwords and the person, the Twitter, tweeter is blocked.
[03:25:24.756 --> 03:25:43.257]  If it's a high profile, it may require manual approval from the National Board of Censors, but the impressions are reduced with a limited capacity, which is why you are seeing less and less likes and retweets from conservative accounts.
[03:25:44.349 --> 03:25:50.796]  Because limiting impression means less people seeing your tweets from their accounts in their regular newsfeeds.
[03:25:51.597 --> 03:25:58.604]  Wikileaks and Goose for 2.0 are ironically not on the list, but let's look at who is.
[03:26:00.171 --> 03:26:05.074]  Juanita Broderick, the woman brutally raped by Bill Clinton.
[03:26:05.314 --> 03:26:08.316]  She is among those who are shadow banned.
[03:26:08.797 --> 03:26:14.821]  The actor John Voight, an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump and the Republican Party.
[03:26:15.501 --> 03:26:15.981]  Banned.

[03:27:11.158 --> 03:27:12.658]  This is incredible, folks.
[03:27:12.798 --> 03:27:18.600]  This is a hit list for those who are out there telling the truth.
[03:27:19.580 --> 03:27:21.421]  This is extraordinary.
[03:27:21.621 --> 03:27:26.182]  Steve Pachinick, Joe Farah band.
[03:27:29.083 --> 03:27:30.543]  This takes away my breath.
[03:27:30.723 --> 03:27:38.625]  It is extraordinary that anybody would be so brazen as to seek to end the free expression rights
[03:27:40.523 --> 03:27:47.234]  That we have used to open up political discourse and indeed to elect Donald Trump.
[03:27:47.735 --> 03:27:49.458]  Jacob Engels is still with us.
[03:27:49.478 --> 03:27:53.164]  Jacob, what do you make of this incredible list?
[03:27:54.861 --> 03:27:56.401]  It really shouldn't be a surprise.
[03:27:56.682 --> 03:28:02.703]  They have been targeting the people who are on the front lines of the Infowar for a long time now.
[03:28:02.723 --> 03:28:06.624]  I think now we can actually see this official list and understand it.
[03:28:07.164 --> 03:28:13.525]  And it's going to become harder and harder to tell the truth and to share what is really going on.
[03:28:13.545 --> 03:28:15.866]  And that's why it's so important.
[03:28:15.946 --> 03:28:21.147]  I know we've talked about several times what people can do to support the Infowar.
[03:28:21.967 --> 03:28:31.692]  I have broken a lot of stories, taken on the establishment, and I really firmly believe that without BrainForce+, I would not have been able to do that.
[03:28:31.752 --> 03:28:40.276]  These stories, these activities, take so much out of you and it becomes harder to tell the truth and disseminate what is really happening.
[03:28:40.336 --> 03:28:41.277]  You know that, Roger.
[03:28:41.757 --> 03:28:42.477]  Alex knows that.
[03:28:42.557 --> 03:28:43.958]  Everyone at InfoWars knows that.
[03:28:44.338 --> 03:28:53.089]  So everyone that is listening that is upset about who is being banned and who is being taken down by the censorship police, do your part.
[03:28:53.569 --> 03:28:56.212]  Go to Infowar store and buy something.
[03:28:56.432 --> 03:29:01.759]  You know, we don't all have a million dollars, but whatever you can do to support the Infowar, we have to do it.
[03:29:02.403 --> 03:29:04.826]  Well, you're right about that, Jacob.
[03:29:05.186 --> 03:29:14.556]  Let me say also, anybody with a Facebook feed, anybody with a Twitter feed, if you're on Instagram or Snapshot, you are an army of one!
[03:29:15.457 --> 03:29:21.103]  If you see a story on Infowars.com and you like it, and you think it's important, repost it!
[03:29:22.048 --> 03:29:24.589]  This is how the war will be won.
[03:29:25.149 --> 03:29:25.950]  God bless you.
[03:29:26.250 --> 03:29:35.554]  We appreciate your being with us here today on InfoWars, and we'll be right back with more of the Stone Cold Truth.
[03:29:51.897 --> 03:29:54.882]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[03:30:03.460 --> 03:30:06.122]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[03:30:06.362 --> 03:30:09.445]  That communist Chinese-style net censorship is coming to the web.
[03:30:09.725 --> 03:30:10.505]  Because it's already here.
[03:30:10.886 --> 03:30:11.546]  It's being announced.
[03:30:11.907 --> 03:30:15.389]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[03:30:15.789 --> 03:30:17.751]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.

[03:30:28.239 --> 03:30:31.261]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.

[03:30:51.530 --> 03:30:53.350]  Optimize cellular energy.
[03:30:54.110 --> 03:30:55.031]  It's DNA Force.

[03:31:11.103 --> 03:31:17.527]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:31:17.767 --> 03:31:26.052]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:31:26.332 --> 03:31:35.077]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:31:35.357 --> 03:31:41.080]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:31:41.440 --> 03:31:41.900]  It works.
[03:31:42.180 --> 03:31:50.484]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[03:31:50.504 --> 03:32:00.047]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.

[03:33:07.404 --> 03:33:11.306]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[03:33:11.746 --> 03:33:15.669]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:16.289 --> 03:33:19.531]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:23.153 --> 03:33:23.793]  Welcome back.
[03:33:24.953 --> 03:33:38.054]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for my friend Alex Jones, and our focus today has been on internet censorship, because as I said earlier, I believe this is the greatest single fight
[03:33:38.968 --> 03:33:39.728]  That we face.
[03:33:39.788 --> 03:33:56.232]  You see, we cannot win the war against globalism, the war over American sovereignty, fights over immigration, or trade, or taxation, or the soundness of our money, if we do not have equal access to the Internet.
[03:33:57.152 --> 03:34:04.994]  The Internet is the underlying vehicle for the revolution that elected Donald Trump.
[03:34:06.209 --> 03:34:10.671]  And now those on the left have realized the enormous mistake that they have made.
[03:34:11.391 --> 03:34:15.433]  They seek to put the toothpaste, again, back into the tube.
[03:34:16.473 --> 03:34:26.798]  I am continuing to review this list of those who are subject to Twitter's shadow band, and it continues to blow my mind.
[03:34:27.618 --> 03:34:30.279]  Jack Bosobiak of Rebel Media.
[03:34:31.059 --> 03:34:32.140]  Zero Hedge.
[03:34:32.980 --> 03:34:33.941]  DC Leaks.
[03:34:34.952 --> 03:34:39.094]  Mike Savage and Savage Nation all banned.
[03:34:40.074 --> 03:34:42.715]  This is an abomination.
[03:34:42.795 --> 03:34:48.457]  This is an affront to our civil liberties and our rights to free expression.
[03:34:49.337 --> 03:34:58.661]  When the government and their enormous grants for the left-wing organizations who are doing the actual blocking
[03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.930]  I think?
[03:35:14.665 --> 03:35:32.250]  That Donald Trump took punitive action in Syria, a direct affront to the Russians, despite the fact that the president nixed what would have been a very lucrative deal for Exxon in Russia.
[03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:47.902]  The mainstream media and their running dog lackeys like Senator Feinstein and Warner and the never funny Al Franken, as well as lightweight congressmen like Adam Schiff,
[03:35:48.823 --> 03:35:51.767]  A man who's so full of schiff his eyes are brown.
[03:35:52.448 --> 03:36:05.766]  They continue to promulgate this Russian lie, confident in the fact that their allies on the tech left can kneecap us when we seek to respond with the truth.
[03:36:06.767 --> 03:36:08.369]  You see how it works now.
[03:36:08.989 --> 03:36:15.155]  They utilize the mainstream media, principally CNN, which is almost unwatchable.
[03:36:15.955 --> 03:36:18.958]  Wolf Blitzer, no Wolf, you're not a journalist.
[03:36:19.639 --> 03:36:20.359]  You're a hack.
[03:36:21.080 --> 03:36:21.841]  You're a flack.
[03:36:22.560 --> 03:36:23.941]  You're a BS artist.
[03:36:24.401 --> 03:36:26.563]  You're anything but a journalist.
[03:36:27.744 --> 03:36:42.356]  And they continue to promulgate the big lie, confident that patriots, viewers, Americans have no place else to go in order to get the counter story.
[03:36:43.396 --> 03:36:47.840]  It's ingenious, except it's not going to work.
[03:36:48.962 --> 03:37:00.791]  We are programmed here to try to examine the exact technologies that are being used to throttle us, to shut us down.
[03:37:01.052 --> 03:37:03.413]  You can call it shadow banning.
[03:37:03.834 --> 03:37:06.616]  You can call it search filtering.
[03:37:06.856 --> 03:37:09.998]  You can call it fake news flagging.
[03:37:10.619 --> 03:37:11.440]  You can call it
[03:37:12.040 --> 03:37:12.680]  Throttling.
[03:37:13.381 --> 03:37:23.585]  And you can examine the ubiquitous use of these computer bots, but they are all being utilized to kneecap us.
[03:37:24.165 --> 03:37:29.228]  They're all being utilized to stop us from reaching you.
[03:37:30.528 --> 03:37:41.113]  And they, unfortunately, have, thanks to their government patronage, the tech giants have become extraordinarily wealthy.
[03:37:42.281 --> 03:37:48.923]  They have an unlimited war chest with which to wage their war for censorship.
[03:37:50.034 --> 03:38:02.182]  We unfortunately have no such riches, which is why we need to count on you to go to TheInfoWarsStore.com and pick up many of the fine products.
[03:38:02.222 --> 03:38:04.403]  Now, there's one there that I'm particularly fond of.
[03:38:05.264 --> 03:38:12.709]  It is my book, The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution.
[03:38:13.783 --> 03:38:25.397]  This book details the role of Infowars.com as the point of the spear, as the cutting edge of the new revolution.
[03:38:26.158 --> 03:38:30.883]  And it speaks of the time when Donald Trump appeared on this very program.
[03:38:31.644 --> 03:38:50.565]  And patriots across the country learned that Donald Trump was the anti-globalist candidate, that Donald Trump believed in American sovereignty, American exceptionalism, American strength, and the Trump candidacy got the imprimatur of Alex Jones himself.
[03:38:54.955 --> 03:38:58.477]  All right, and now we have some breaking news from the man himself.
[03:38:58.637 --> 03:39:00.199]  Alex Jones is going to join us.
[03:39:00.319 --> 03:39:02.820]  Alex, welcome back to your own program.
[03:39:03.921 --> 03:39:04.561]  Roger, absolutely.
[03:39:04.581 --> 03:39:05.282]  Thanks for pulling in today.
[03:39:05.302 --> 03:39:06.042]  You're doing a great job.
[03:39:06.062 --> 03:39:08.044]  We're going to watch more shows, go after our own show.
[03:39:08.064 --> 03:39:10.205]  I have some minds for her and all the board operators.
[03:39:10.225 --> 03:39:11.606]  I'm getting the satellite time.
[03:39:11.626 --> 03:39:12.186]  I'll get that all ready.
[03:39:12.226 --> 03:39:13.547]  I want you to go to your guest here in a minute.
[03:39:13.968 --> 03:39:20.112]  I just wanted to call in on this Friday broadcast because I'm taking care of some family stuff and some business stuff today.
[03:39:20.132 --> 03:39:21.873]  You and David and I are doing a fabulous job.
[03:39:22.512 --> 03:39:32.660]  But there's an article by Clifford Cunningham on Unforged.com that links directly, and I want to get your take on this briefly, to the New Yorker magazine that he knows, one of the main mouthpieces of the elites.
[03:39:33.521 --> 03:39:45.190]  And they say, we're meeting in Congress secretly, bipartisanly, and with members of Trump's administration, deciding to say he's mentally ill, like the 200 psychologists and psychiatrists have said, violating the Goldwater Rule.
[03:39:46.337 --> 03:39:53.041]  Well, they said we are going to basically either overthrow him, or have an impeachment, or just declare he's insane under the 25th Amendment.
[03:39:53.581 --> 03:40:05.748]  Now that's- and they're talking about using the current body of government, COT, again, claiming the rest can control you and me and everybody else, while Barack Obama and everybody else were involved in the election fratillery, when the media got caught doing it.
[03:40:05.768 --> 03:40:09.510]  They got caught trying to defeat LePin for macaron.
[03:40:10.569 --> 03:40:11.829]  All the rest of it's coming out.
[03:40:12.289 --> 03:40:16.631]  Paul Watson has a powerful video, The Proof About Macaron, on Infowars.com.
[03:40:16.651 --> 03:40:17.331]  It just went live.
[03:40:17.351 --> 03:40:19.991]  Everybody, after you're off in 20 minutes, should go to it.
[03:40:20.031 --> 03:40:21.452]  But I want you to go to your guests.
[03:40:21.472 --> 03:40:23.552]  You can skip this network break.
[03:40:23.592 --> 03:40:26.473]  We don't skip many of these days, but you can skip this one at 50 so you have more time.
[03:40:27.513 --> 03:40:28.113]  Go to your guests.
[03:40:28.133 --> 03:40:34.675]  It's just the point is, I'm 100% backing Trump because he's got $3 trillion in the stock market.
[03:40:35.996 --> 03:40:49.704]  Exuberance, again, a belief in America, confidence, 300 million in new jobs, already in the House, half a million new jobs already in place, 106 days in, a much better bill than Obamacare now passed the House, doing unthinkably successful things.
[03:40:50.625 --> 03:40:55.287]  And then in the news saying, we've decided he's a failure, so we're going to remove him.
[03:40:55.647 --> 03:41:00.890]  A quote, how Donald Trump could be fired is the headline, when we put that article up on screen.
[03:41:01.431 --> 03:41:03.612]  So everybody's got to get serious for a chance.
[03:41:04.454 --> 03:41:05.495]  He's having to compromise.
[03:41:05.955 --> 03:41:07.977]  They wanted to stall the government and say it was his fault.
[03:41:08.418 --> 03:41:09.398]  He's having to compromise.
[03:41:09.438 --> 03:41:13.182]  He's completely surrounded, only has a few friends, even in his administration.
[03:41:13.582 --> 03:41:19.888]  And you notice in this article, it says they're talking to people high-level in his administration that have decided themselves, you need to go.
[03:41:20.268 --> 03:41:21.249]  Well, who's in the mall?
[03:41:21.449 --> 03:41:23.811]  They're in, you know, debt, basically.
[03:41:24.211 --> 03:41:26.173]  They're just colluding with the George Soros people.
[03:41:26.213 --> 03:41:27.074]  I'm sorry, it's a fact.
[03:41:27.654 --> 03:41:30.017]  They're the ones that have cleaned house of all his real supporters.
[03:41:30.457 --> 03:41:31.618]  The government's over-delivered.
[03:41:32.646 --> 03:41:35.088]  In 106 days, he's over-delivered.
[03:41:35.428 --> 03:41:37.310]  Reagan didn't get this done in three years.
[03:41:37.350 --> 03:41:39.451]  We've got a Republican who did what it was in 1954.
[03:41:39.572 --> 03:41:41.713]  It took Reagan three and a half years to get there.
[03:41:41.733 --> 03:41:45.176]  In only 100-something days, we're trying to stall the economy.
[03:41:45.536 --> 03:41:50.280]  But even the EU's stock market's gone back up on the exuberance of the Trump effect.
[03:41:50.320 --> 03:41:54.583]  So, again, Trump's not perfect, folks, but he's in the eye of the storm.
[03:41:54.904 --> 03:41:57.766]  He has the globalists attacking him because he's the president now.
[03:41:58.923 --> 03:42:04.008]  He's bringing power back to the Executive, back to the Legislative, back to the Judicial, and then back to the State.
[03:42:04.449 --> 03:42:06.871]  We have to bring the swamp of our own lives on every level.
[03:42:07.231 --> 03:42:08.853]  Down in the city, state, federal, international.
[03:42:09.193 --> 03:42:11.215]  He's cut the UN funding by half.
[03:42:11.255 --> 03:42:15.359]  These illegals coming in, it's down 43% in just the first 100 days.
[03:42:15.679 --> 03:42:16.660]  That's all content.
[03:42:16.981 --> 03:42:18.082]  And that's why they're panicking.
[03:42:18.122 --> 03:42:19.043]  If he was selling out,
[03:42:19.543 --> 03:42:27.810]  They wouldn't be openly trying to sell the idea of positive government, martial law, and floating it down mainstream news as if it's no big deal.
[03:42:27.850 --> 03:42:29.432]  So I told people this three months ago.
[03:42:29.452 --> 03:42:30.813]  I saw the movements.
[03:42:31.153 --> 03:42:32.274]  Now it's been muted.
[03:42:32.775 --> 03:42:36.438]  Now they're on CNN saying, you know, they hope ISIS blows up, you know, where he lives.
[03:42:36.878 --> 03:42:37.919]  Nobody gets arrested.
[03:42:38.239 --> 03:42:42.142]  They're saying, go after me, kill me, kill Stone, kill those that hit with colonial.
[03:42:42.443 --> 03:42:44.985]  They're trying to destroy my family, openly.
[03:42:45.545 --> 03:42:51.090]  They are coming after anybody they think isn't a coward who will rally the American people against this global tyranny.
[03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:55.153]  We have a great chance of winning, but all of you guys spread the word and get past the Twitter.
[03:42:56.109 --> 03:42:59.530]  You've got a hand to spread our likes on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google.
[03:42:59.730 --> 03:43:01.951]  Start your own website, magnify what we're doing.
[03:43:02.051 --> 03:43:02.891]  Start your own site.
[03:43:02.951 --> 03:43:03.812]  Close, expand.
[03:43:04.032 --> 03:43:04.912]  Call us on radio.
[03:43:04.972 --> 03:43:09.974]  Infowars.com is the forbidden site because it's the clearinghouse for all these great minds.
[03:43:10.354 --> 03:43:13.315]  So if they're openly in the news, don't go to the guests.
[03:43:13.455 --> 03:43:15.656]  I'm going to get off here, Roger, but...
[03:43:16.468 --> 03:43:19.009]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are moving against everyone.
[03:43:19.049 --> 03:43:20.990]  They're kicking their ass.
[03:43:21.410 --> 03:43:24.012]  Our ideology is pure success, pure Americana.
[03:43:24.372 --> 03:43:25.292]  They can't deal with it.
[03:43:25.372 --> 03:43:28.974]  And Trump is like a lion with a hundred hyenas at him right now.
[03:43:28.994 --> 03:43:31.496]  Some of us are bitching, saying, should have done this better.
[03:43:31.776 --> 03:43:34.377]  I'm saying, we're doing a lot right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:43:34.697 --> 03:43:36.478]  Trump is for real, don't embarrass anybody.
[03:43:36.798 --> 03:43:38.219]  Pray for him, pray for us.
[03:43:38.459 --> 03:43:39.740]  We're going in through and beyond.
[03:43:39.780 --> 03:43:41.541]  Back to Roger Stone of the Global Press, I think.
[03:43:41.721 --> 03:43:43.241]  I'll be back in public study for us at 6 p.m.
[03:43:43.361 --> 03:43:44.442]  Central, Lord willing.
[03:43:46.496 --> 03:43:50.180]  You know, Alex, this is such incredibly important breaking news.
[03:43:50.260 --> 03:44:02.592]  I'm going to ask our guest, Dr. Franklin Brothers, to come back and join us next week and we can continue the discussion of the censorship campaign because what you've just put on the table must be addressed.
[03:44:03.641 --> 03:44:11.207]  I first sensed that there would be a future move to remove Trump when I was watching the Cabinet selections.
[03:44:12.127 --> 03:44:30.842]  As you know, under the 25th Amendment, if a majority of the Cabinet and the Vice President decide that the President is incapacitated, cannot fulfill the duties of his office, that he is removed.
[03:44:31.562 --> 03:44:38.604]  Now, he can challenge that decision, but it would go to a vote of the U.S.
[03:44:38.965 --> 03:44:42.766]  House, controlled by Paul Ryan.
[03:44:43.806 --> 03:44:57.531]  Despite Paul Ryan's success in repealing Obamacare, I don't think anyone on the anti-globalist right considers him anything but a quizling, a spy in our midst.
[03:44:58.405 --> 03:45:12.279]  After all, he was Mitt Romney's running mate for Vice President, and Mitt Romney did a superb job of offering the American people the exact same thing that Barack Obama offered them.
[03:45:12.860 --> 03:45:14.982]  An election of no choice.
[03:45:15.894 --> 03:45:17.235]  My conscience is clear.
[03:45:17.935 --> 03:45:20.176]  I voted for Governor Gary Johnson.
[03:45:20.756 --> 03:45:22.537]  This was four years ago.
[03:45:23.337 --> 03:45:36.183]  So I think cabinet members in some cases have been carefully picked because they have an establishment background and when the signal came that Donald Trump's
[03:45:37.423 --> 03:45:49.809]  Anti, I would say, Donald Trump's iconoclastic personal leadership style and the idiosyncrasies of his personality came to the forefront.
[03:45:50.329 --> 03:45:59.073]  And they weren't the homogenized bullshit that we've gotten from your typical mainstream career politicians.
[03:45:59.613 --> 03:46:04.636]  Well, we'll just declare him crazy and try to move him on.
[03:46:05.496 --> 03:46:17.307]  Make no mistake about it, if this should fail, the Democrats and some established Republicans have an impeachment fallback position.
[03:46:18.068 --> 03:46:22.191]  This is how much Donald Trump threatens the New World Order.
[03:46:23.052 --> 03:46:44.980]  This is how much of a crimp he puts in the plans of George Soros and others for a one world globalist government in which we give up all of our American sovereignty and any claim to the constitutional rights that are guaranteed to us by that great document.
[03:46:46.047 --> 03:47:00.097]  Make no mistake about it, the entrenched two-party duopoly in Washington that has run this country into the ground will never come to terms with President Donald Trump.
[03:47:00.778 --> 03:47:04.180]  First, they tried to deny him the presidency.
[03:47:04.841 --> 03:47:11.846]  When that failed, they tried to destabilize his presidency and to delegitimize it.
[03:47:12.626 --> 03:47:32.298]  And now that that has failed, and particularly because he's making real progress on issues such as our economy and our economic well-being, such as Obamacare, well they have to get him out of there, and in their view, the sooner the better.
[03:47:33.359 --> 03:47:34.700]  Who's behind this effort?
[03:47:35.632 --> 03:47:58.720]  The elites, the power elites in New York and Washington and London and Paris and elsewhere, those who would profit mightily from future wars, war in Syria for example, and they will give no quarter, there is no limit to what they will attempt to do.
[03:47:59.778 --> 03:48:05.081]  We've seen the effort to destroy Alex Jones, the man, and his family.
[03:48:05.801 --> 03:48:10.024]  We have seen them seek to kill Nigel Farage.
[03:48:10.804 --> 03:48:12.905]  I myself have been poisoned.
[03:48:13.405 --> 03:48:21.470]  I have been the subject of a suspicious hit-and-run, which totaled the car that I was riding in.
[03:48:22.370 --> 03:48:29.034]  But thank my God, I was not injured, and I will not be silenced.
[03:48:29.966 --> 03:48:31.248]  Nor will Alex Jones.
[03:48:31.869 --> 03:48:38.578]  Nor will any of the other of those on the Twitter ban list that I read only days ago.
[03:48:39.738 --> 03:48:46.780]  They're going to try to take our president out, and we are going to have to mobilize public opinion against this.
[03:48:47.540 --> 03:49:01.804]  It was only a matter of time, because they see in Trump's individualism and his leadership style, they see something far different, far more dangerous to them.
[03:49:03.032 --> 03:49:07.014]  He's not reading off a script written by the establishment.
[03:49:07.595 --> 03:49:21.484]  He's not being handed talking points by some 25-year-old who reports to Reince Priebus, who sadly reports to Paul Ryan, not the President of the United States.
[03:49:22.406 --> 03:49:35.697]  Yet we see patriots like Anthony Scaramucci or Rick, Richard, Rick Grinnell, true Trumpites, those who are in the front lines of the Trump revolution.
[03:49:36.117 --> 03:49:45.104]  How many hours did Anthony Scaramucci spend on mainstream media defending Donald Trump and attacking his competitors?
[03:49:45.845 --> 03:49:52.108]  Yet you won't find those gentlemen in the Trump administration where they belong.
[03:49:53.028 --> 03:49:54.469]  It's a disgrace.
[03:49:55.650 --> 03:50:02.273]  Yes, the threat that our president faces is from within and from without.
[03:50:03.433 --> 03:50:06.275]  I saw a t-shirt last night that inspired me.
[03:50:06.315 --> 03:50:08.116]  I'm going to redesign it.
[03:50:08.896 --> 03:50:14.719]  It says quite simply, I love the Donald, but I didn't vote for Jared Kushner.
[03:50:15.509 --> 03:50:16.810]  And that sums it up.
[03:50:17.631 --> 03:50:39.887]  The Jared Kushners, the Reince Priebuses, the Gary Cohn, the former Goldman head who is now Donald Trump's chief economic advisor, despite his opposition to all of the economic philosophies of Donald Trump, these men are not serving the President well.
[03:50:40.667 --> 03:50:44.030]  My confidence, my belief, is in Donald Trump.
[03:50:44.810 --> 03:50:54.515]  As I said in the 30-hour marathon, when Donald Trump has all the information, he will invariably make the right decision.
[03:50:55.396 --> 03:51:09.043]  But virtually no one in this administration, outside of a handful, can be trusted because, sadly, many of them do not share the President's vision or the President's agenda.
[03:51:10.124 --> 03:51:12.205]  So, strap yourself in.
[03:51:13.237 --> 03:51:14.878]  You're going to need that seatbelt.
[03:51:15.138 --> 03:51:18.040]  We are in for the fight of the century.
[03:51:18.580 --> 03:51:22.362]  We won this election for the cause of Americanism.
[03:51:22.843 --> 03:51:36.991]  We put Donald Trump in the White House and we will not let him be removed by some crazy left-wing globalist cabal that thinks they know better than we do what is good for America.
[03:51:37.911 --> 03:51:39.952]  Alex, thanks for breaking in with that news.
[03:51:40.552 --> 03:51:41.773]  It is timely.
[03:51:42.313 --> 03:51:52.018]  Next week, we will bring Dr. Franklin Brothers back to tell us exactly, technically, how they are seeking to strangle our communications on the Internet.
[03:51:52.458 --> 03:51:55.920]  But more importantly, what you can do to fight it.
[03:51:56.760 --> 03:51:57.861]  You heard Alex Jones.
[03:51:58.851 --> 03:52:02.692]  He is the leader here.
[03:52:02.732 --> 03:52:05.973]  If you ask me, he's the MVP.
[03:52:06.954 --> 03:52:12.616]  And that is why the personal campaign of vituperation against him.
[03:52:13.456 --> 03:52:25.740]  That is why you see him parried on television shows, which ironically show the actual activities of the radical left.
[03:52:26.513 --> 03:52:31.918]  But ascribe it to those of us who are here fighting for freedom of expression.
[03:52:32.738 --> 03:52:38.563]  Oh yes, there are thousands of fake Facebook and Twitter posters.
[03:52:38.823 --> 03:52:41.505]  There are the so-called computer bots.
[03:52:42.166 --> 03:52:43.727]  But they're not working for us.
[03:52:44.608 --> 03:52:46.950]  They're working for the criminal David Brock.
[03:52:47.771 --> 03:52:52.735]  They're working for the criminal enterprise Media Matters for America.
[03:52:53.718 --> 03:53:01.105]  And therefore, we see again the left accusing us of doing what they are doing.
[03:53:01.846 --> 03:53:04.308]  They do it again and again.
[03:53:04.328 --> 03:53:06.610]  So Alex was right.
[03:53:07.571 --> 03:53:16.900]  If you have a Facebook tweet, a feed, if you have a Twitter feed, if you're on social media, you are an army of one.
[03:53:18.126 --> 03:53:19.948]  We need you in this fight.
[03:53:20.669 --> 03:53:22.891]  This is not armchair activism.
[03:53:22.972 --> 03:53:30.140]  In the modern day, in the internet age, you're on the front lines if you're out there spreading the good word.
[03:53:31.341 --> 03:53:36.487]  We work very hard at places like Stone Cold Truth, StoneZone.com,
[03:53:37.762 --> 03:53:40.344]  The Central Florida Post.
[03:53:41.404 --> 03:53:49.309]  We work overtime to try to provide the content, as they say in computer terms, the news, as it were.
[03:53:49.870 --> 03:53:53.512]  The facts that you need to combat the globalist left.
[03:53:54.552 --> 03:54:01.797]  But none of us, none of it does us any good if we are being stifled at the technical level.
[03:54:03.578 --> 03:54:09.365]  You know, I think it was Chairman Mao who said, let a thousand flowers bloom.
[03:54:10.446 --> 03:54:15.392]  He's also the one who said political power flows from the barrel of a gun.
[03:54:17.054 --> 03:54:19.336]  Let's take his first quote, if we may.
[03:54:20.316 --> 03:54:21.217]  He's talking about you.
[03:54:21.237 --> 03:54:25.179]  He's talking about your ability to get out there on the net.
[03:54:25.539 --> 03:54:29.061]  You see something at Infowars.com that you find compelling?
[03:54:29.841 --> 03:54:30.582]  Repost it.
[03:54:31.082 --> 03:54:37.186]  If you have to shorten it to hide the buzzwords inside the address, you can do that as well.
[03:54:37.906 --> 03:54:43.909]  There's any number of shortening services online, but get the news out there.
[03:54:44.450 --> 03:54:48.132]  And as I like to say in my book speeches around the country,
[03:54:49.087 --> 03:54:51.729]  Tweet and retweet until your fingers hurt.
[03:54:52.951 --> 03:54:56.173]  Quantity matters as well as quality.
[03:54:57.014 --> 03:55:00.798]  You, as an individual, can reach thousands of people.
[03:55:01.138 --> 03:55:11.708]  You can tell them about the products at TheInfoWarsStore.com and how those expenditures support the fight for liberty.
[03:55:12.827 --> 03:55:25.431]  Now is probably a good time to tell you that the entire defense of free speech mega specials, which we have up online right now, are ending soon at TheInfoWarStore.com.
[03:55:26.071 --> 03:55:31.132]  I'm talking about 30% off of Brain Force, 20% off of Secret 12, 20% off of Knockout, 20% off of Winter Sun.
[03:55:37.655 --> 03:55:39.537]  20% off to Prostagard.
[03:55:40.858 --> 03:55:44.021]  20% off of Bio PCA.
[03:55:44.042 --> 03:55:46.344]  20% off of Biome Defense 25.
[03:55:47.605 --> 03:55:49.227]  20% off of Living Defense.
[03:55:50.007 --> 03:55:55.953]  This is a product that I think helped save my life after I was poisoned.
[03:55:56.413 --> 03:55:59.396]  30% off of the ProPure King water filters.
[03:56:00.307 --> 03:56:05.410]  This is something that my cousins recently acquired, and they swear by it.
[03:56:05.850 --> 03:56:11.234]  And of course, DNA Force is back in stock, but it won't be for long, folks.
[03:56:12.335 --> 03:56:20.882]  Because we're not funded by the establishment, we don't have the kind of funds that Google and Amazon and Facebook and Twitter have.
[03:56:21.462 --> 03:56:23.564]  We have to count on you.
[03:56:23.804 --> 03:56:29.369]  This revolution is financed and funded and underwritten by you.
[03:56:29.529 --> 03:56:40.638]  So please, visit the store, take an opportunity now with these unbelievable price breaks to help us finance the revolution.
[03:56:41.561 --> 03:56:44.562]  You'll be glad you did, because it's win-win.
[03:56:44.583 --> 03:56:59.510]  I can speak firsthand to the quality of the products available on the store, and I've seen the operation underground there in Austin, and I've seen the way we are financing an exciting revolution.
[03:57:01.794 --> 03:57:11.583]  One other thing I am being coached to mention is the upcoming birthday of President John F. Kennedy.
[03:57:12.484 --> 03:57:15.747]  I am going to be among the speakers on the 29th
[03:57:17.228 --> 03:57:18.189]  Of May.
[03:57:19.750 --> 03:57:24.975]  I'm going to be speaking remote for 100th Birthday Online Conference.
[03:57:25.015 --> 03:57:28.518]  You see it there, May 29th, starting at 9am.
[03:57:29.619 --> 03:57:32.702]  Ed Haslam speaking about Oswald in New Orleans.
[03:57:33.222 --> 03:57:38.968]  Barr McClellan talking about Vice President Lyndon Johnson and his role.
[03:57:39.708 --> 03:57:45.712]  My friend Dr. James Fetzer talking about the Zapruder film and how it was altered.
[03:57:45.852 --> 03:57:49.935]  Gary Fannin talking about Oswald's movements in Dallas.
[03:57:50.836 --> 03:57:58.902]  Larry Rivera showing that there is proof of Oswald standing outside the Texas School Book Depository building.
[03:57:59.582 --> 03:58:01.063]  Wayne Madsen and others.
[03:58:01.123 --> 03:58:03.565]  This is going to be a dynamite conference.
[03:58:04.045 --> 03:58:06.167]  You don't want to miss it.
[03:58:06.807 --> 03:58:07.628]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:58:07.648 --> 03:58:14.536]  I want to thank you again for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show and remind you, victory or death.
[03:58:45.106 --> 03:58:49.087]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:55.830 --> 03:58:57.150]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[03:58:57.170 --> 03:58:58.531]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:58:59.491 --> 03:58:59.851]  Great!
[03:58:59.951 --> 03:59:00.931]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:59:01.072 --> 03:59:05.453]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:59:05.593 --> 03:59:14.676]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:59:14.696 --> 03:59:15.416]  Wow, thank you.
[03:59:15.456 --> 03:59:18.017]  You're the type of lizard that makes it all possible.
[03:59:18.097 --> 03:59:19.718]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[03:59:19.918 --> 03:59:23.239]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[03:59:23.399 --> 03:59:23.879]  That's amazing.
[03:59:24.059 --> 03:59:28.120]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:59:28.160 --> 03:59:29.100]  It's a win-win, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:59:54.150 --> 03:59:59.735]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
