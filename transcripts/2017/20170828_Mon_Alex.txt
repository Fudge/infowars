[00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:15.070]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:46.236]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com have got the complete coverage, including our reporters on a kayak in the middle of what is now the Gulf of Houston.
[00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:52.500]  I think GrudgeReport.com gets it right, coining the term the Gulf of Houston.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.987]  Some areas will be uninhabitable for a long period of time.
[00:00:56.987 --> 00:00:59.430]  State of Texas is now saying.
[00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.093]  You can see on screen of your TV viewer.
[00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:06.370]  Footage shot by Michael Zimmerman and more crew that he's recruited.
[00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.253]  He's got family down in Houston and I wouldn't actually send reporters into this, so he volunteered on his own and went down there.
[00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:15.895]  Owen Schroer was also down there for several days.
[00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:19.997]  15 trillion gallons.
[00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:21.297]  And here's the bad news.
[00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:28.901]  After 15 trillion gallons dumped on Houston the last three days, the storm has run back out into the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:41.202]  And is set to turn back in tomorrow and hit the city again.
[00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:56.573]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, after coming in and hitting Rockport, going up the coast, it's gone out to sea and is going to be coming back in to Houston.
[00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.055]  Unspeakable situation.
[00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.156]  Undoubtedly the storm of the century.
[00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:16.807]  They're saying that Texas has never, in about 150 years of accurate recording, since the University of Texas started doing it, Texas has never seen rainfall totals this high.
[00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:23.013]  50 inches on average over the Houston area and many areas of East Texas.
[00:02:23.013 --> 00:02:26.336]  Many parts of Houston are 20 feet or more below water.
[00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:33.774]  Some will argue, like they did with New Orleans, why did you build a megacity down there where things flood?
[00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:39.741]  Because that's where the rivers are, it's where the state lines are, it's where the ocean is, it's where commerce is.
[00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:41.663]  The whole world's a dangerous place!
[00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:42.985]  The tectonic plates and...
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.540]  Earthquakes and tornadoes.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.521]  It's just part of life, ladies and gentlemen, that this is an ever-changing, dangerous world.
[00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:59.183]  Anybody that tries to tell you they can cut out any type of danger in your life is trying to basically turn you into a prisoner.
[00:02:59.183 --> 00:03:07.565]  Speaking of prisoner, I've had several members of parliament on from the UK over the years, and both of them that I had on were liberals.
[00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:13.826]  But they said that what's happening is the Muslims particularly, but also some Eastern European immigrants,
[00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:22.376]  Don't get regular jobs, they become social workers, or they become foster parents.
[00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:31.697]  And that it's mainly Muslims, and that they actually warehouse the children, and it's come out in the news, children warned of this years ago, no one believed them.
[00:03:31.697 --> 00:03:41.219]  In some towns, over 5,000 young girls have been kidnapped and raped, and many times, in the hands of the foster services.
[00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.440]  There's a story out of the Times of London,
[00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:50.668]  That absolutely makes me, let's just say, extremely angry.
[00:03:50.668 --> 00:04:05.674]  Muslim foster carers told Christian Girl 5 that Christmas and Easter are stupid, European women are alcoholics, and this is just the whitewash, and took her cross away and basically told her she's a Muslim now.
[00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:09.335]  She was given to people that don't speak English and wear full burqas
[00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.992]  And she cries in bags and the foster services say it's good to learn other cultures.
[00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:20.074]  This will teach you not to be a Christian.
[00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:22.896]  There's the headline, Times of London.
[00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:27.559]  Christian child forced into Muslim foster care.
[00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.480]  I'm not laughing at the child, I'm laughing at political correctness.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.744]  It is designed to destroy the West and Christianity, period!
[00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:41.067]  You are under attack if you are a Christian, period!
[00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:47.711]  And they're now beginning through Amazon and other big networks to ban Christians from commerce.
[00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:53.941]  Lawsuits have been filed by the D. James Kennedy Center, Family Research Council, and others.
[00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:55.023]  This is really happening.
[00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:56.565]  The Mark of the Beast is here!
[00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:10.836]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:13.398]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[00:05:13.398 --> 00:05:16.841]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:19.042]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[00:05:19.042 --> 00:05:23.866]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality known concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:26.748]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:29.190]  It's never been the price it is right now.
[00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.510]  With 3,596 reviews, 4.6
[00:05:31.912 --> 00:05:33.854]  Reviews totaled by third-party sites.
[00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:34.755]  Unprecedented.
[00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:35.976]  And it's cold-pressed.
[00:05:35.976 --> 00:05:37.918]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[00:05:37.918 --> 00:05:40.881]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science.
[00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:44.264]  These are other, what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[00:05:44.264 --> 00:05:46.326]  It's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[00:05:46.326 --> 00:05:47.547]  Why these aren't anything new?
[00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:51.811]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:51.991]  Boo!
[00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:52.051]  Boo!
[00:05:59.384 --> 00:06:04.848]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:06:04.848 --> 00:06:06.950]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.233]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:15.756]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:19.519]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.

[00:06:22.722 --> 00:06:26.585]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.

[00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:39.155]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:41.457]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[00:06:41.457 --> 00:06:49.745]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.

[00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:07.410]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.370]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.662 --> 00:08:23.107]  The city of Houston is now the Gulf of Houston.
[00:08:24.793 --> 00:08:28.476]  There are many areas under more than 20 feet of water.
[00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:36.243]  The devastating record monster demon storm, Hurricane Harvey, has now basically broken up.
[00:08:36.243 --> 00:08:49.075]  Part of it's gone back out to sea and they're saying it may reconstitute by tomorrow and come slamming back into Houston, as well as East Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, right as President Trump is set
[00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:56.231]  To travel to Texas to survey the damage and give federal support.
[00:08:56.231 --> 00:08:57.452]  Why is this different though?
[00:08:57.452 --> 00:09:06.117]  Why is even local news having to admit that this time the response is the best they've ever seen to a hurricane?
[00:09:06.117 --> 00:09:16.443]  It's because Trump ordered FEMA to stay out of the way of the state, the counties, the locals, the individual citizens, and to let the state direct the crisis.
[00:09:17.884 --> 00:09:22.146]  And to have the feds then be directed by the locals that know where everything is.
[00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:32.650]  The reason Katrina was so incredibly horrible was because they ordered a stand down for three days.
[00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.570]  And FEMA said, we're in charge.
[00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:42.193]  And remember, went in and cut the police communications radio tower on day two because the police were not following orders.
[00:09:42.193 --> 00:09:47.055]  And we're doing things like trying to go to nursing homes to, quote, save their own mamas.
[00:09:48.217 --> 00:09:50.478]  Remember when the sheriff broke down because his mama died?
[00:09:50.478 --> 00:09:51.579]  He followed the orders.
[00:09:51.579 --> 00:09:52.579]  Didn't go for three days.
[00:09:52.579 --> 00:09:53.099]  She died.
[00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:57.682]  Remember that on CBS News?
[00:09:57.682 --> 00:10:01.624]  So Trump did a great job on this, and I'm not trying to just defend the president.
[00:10:01.624 --> 00:10:11.629]  Look at the difference between Bush and saying, great job, Brownie, some guy that owned Arabian horses, so Bush's Islamic donors said put him in charge.
[00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:19.433]  Here's Governor Abbott talking about the federal support.
[00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:26.197]  What can you tell us about President Trump's personal engagement in this problem and in managing the response to it?
[00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.351]  It's been extremely professional, very helpful.
[00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:35.813]  He called and said, Governor, whatever you need, you've got.
[00:10:35.813 --> 00:10:43.515]  And this is the quickest turnaround I've ever seen from the time that a governor made a disaster declaration to getting that granted.
[00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:55.059]  What that means for the layperson out there is because the president so swiftly granted my application for a disaster declaration, it means it triggered all the resources of FEMA.
[00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:57.100]  And it is a catastrophe.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.081]  There's 10 million people in the city of Houston now.
[00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:01.262]  I'm going to tell the White House something right now.
[00:11:01.262 --> 00:11:03.923]  I'm going to tell all of our listeners something right now.
[00:11:24.346 --> 00:11:29.229]  That is absolutely of the maximum level of criticalness.
[00:11:29.229 --> 00:11:44.377]  And if everyone just listens to me, you're going to realize this is common sense, hiding in plain view, but that we have to go against our own libertarian, conservative, Christian nature on this.
[00:11:44.377 --> 00:11:48.799]  We're not like the leftists that turn everything around against their enemies and lie continually.
[00:11:50.165 --> 00:11:56.889]  And we're not the types, even when anti-fop beats, kills, attacks folks to even complain about it.
[00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:59.291]  But we have to start putting the blame on them.
[00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:03.794]  I know we're the type of folks that are just going to focus on getting things fixed here in Texas.
[00:12:03.794 --> 00:12:06.696]  And that's important and that's the main mission.
[00:12:06.696 --> 00:12:14.581]  But the Democrat mayor of Houston that absolutely openly hates Trump
[00:12:16.294 --> 00:12:20.076]  Publicly said, oh, this is a bunch of hype last week for Trump.
[00:12:20.076 --> 00:12:22.078]  We're not going to declare an emergency.
[00:12:22.078 --> 00:12:24.419]  It's going to miss us.
[00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:28.862]  Because they knew Trump was going to respond hardcore like he did during the campaign.
[00:12:28.862 --> 00:12:29.863]  He's not stupid.
[00:12:29.863 --> 00:12:30.623]  Plus, he really cares.
[00:12:30.623 --> 00:12:33.365]  That's what he's all about.
[00:12:33.365 --> 00:12:36.007]  And they knew that all this was coming.
[00:12:36.007 --> 00:12:40.950]  And so they just wanted to play along with the imaginary fact that everything was going to be OK.
[00:12:42.338 --> 00:12:51.325]  Hoping that it would be a worse emergency even if it did hit because people wouldn't have evacuated and somehow that would blow back on Trump.
[00:12:51.325 --> 00:12:52.786]  You know how the Democrats operate.
[00:12:52.786 --> 00:12:56.369]  You know the memos that have come out about not letting a good crisis go to waste.
[00:12:56.369 --> 00:13:04.776]  You know they confer with their major governors and their major mayors and that Houston's one of the top Democrat mayors and pretty much a Democrat city now.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.041]  The artillery is the state blue.
[00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:16.327]  And so you know that last week they got warned on Thursday by Abbott and said, you better do mandatory evacuation.
[00:13:16.327 --> 00:13:22.391]  And the governor left the city officials alone to have their authority, even though he could have overridden it.
[00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:24.073]  Maybe he should have.
[00:13:24.073 --> 00:13:28.936]  But then if the storm wouldn't hit the city, they'd be all, you're fascistic, ordering people to leave.
[00:13:28.936 --> 00:13:33.559]  So everybody's trying to balance this here on not letting the Democrats score giant political points.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.967]  You better believe they want this to be the Waterloo, pun intended, of Donald John Trump.
[00:13:40.967 --> 00:13:44.851]  I mean, they've got the big central banks out trying to plunge the stock market.
[00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:47.814]  They've raised interest rates four times trying to kill this recovery.
[00:13:47.814 --> 00:13:50.678]  They're doing everything they can.
[00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.691]  And now Democrats themselves in the city are pissed.
[00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:59.013]  They're saying, why didn't you tell people to evacuate?
[00:13:59.013 --> 00:13:59.993]  Why didn't you trigger?
[00:13:59.993 --> 00:14:03.094]  Because the county and city is supposed to do that.
[00:14:03.094 --> 00:14:08.256]  The evacuation call to the governor and then the signs all turn on and then everybody's supposed to get out of there.
[00:14:08.256 --> 00:14:09.277]  Because that's how this works.
[00:14:09.277 --> 00:14:12.258]  Nobody wants some centralized power over them.
[00:14:12.258 --> 00:14:20.061]  FEMA's not supposed to just come in, push the governor, push the mayor, push the county, push the state police, push the local police and the sheriff's departments around.
[00:14:21.172 --> 00:14:26.075]  They did that in Katrina.
[00:14:26.075 --> 00:14:28.956]  Hard to believe that was so long ago.
[00:14:28.956 --> 00:14:43.724]  But by the time Abbott called for that, there were already Humvees and trucks and Goose and a Half and emergency command centers and trailers to house people rolling in.
[00:14:43.724 --> 00:14:49.608]  Our crew has been driving all over the state of Texas this weekend and they have seen just the roads choked.
[00:14:50.595 --> 00:14:54.944]  With FEMA emergency vehicles that are stockpiled up between Dallas and Fort Worth.
[00:14:54.944 --> 00:14:59.273]  You drive up I-35, you take the branch up towards, um...
[00:15:00.253 --> 00:15:01.274]  Fort Worth.
[00:15:01.274 --> 00:15:10.819]  And you will just look out to your left and look out to your right and just see tens of thousands of trailers and emergency vehicles and things for a major hurricane hitting Houston.
[00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:12.240]  And that is indeed what's happened.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.742]  And it's now instantly going into motion down there.
[00:15:15.742 --> 00:15:17.042]  It's not that government's perfect.
[00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:21.085]  It's not everything's going to go absolutely, you know, like angels are running this.
[00:15:21.085 --> 00:15:25.047]  But you're seeing night and day response from George W. Bush
[00:15:27.028 --> 00:15:31.312]  Now, when you talk about Obama and hurricane responses, non-existent!
[00:15:31.312 --> 00:15:32.493]  Because why does he have to?
[00:15:32.493 --> 00:15:33.154]  He's a Democrat.
[00:15:33.154 --> 00:15:34.575]  He's got the media on his side.
[00:15:34.575 --> 00:15:38.859]  The cold-bloodedness of these people.
[00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:41.081]  Just like they wanted Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bankrupted.
[00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:43.904]  Remember all that?
[00:15:43.904 --> 00:15:45.745]  Because they didn't want the public being homeowners.
[00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:47.006]  They want you to be renters.
[00:15:47.006 --> 00:15:49.188]  That all came out in the lawsuits and documents.
[00:15:49.188 --> 00:15:50.610]  The feds have lost lawsuits over this.
[00:15:51.823 --> 00:16:02.872]  It's how sickening it is that Obama is absolutely, totally and completely out to get the average person.
[00:16:02.872 --> 00:16:05.494]  It's simply amazing to witness that.
[00:16:10.939 --> 00:16:14.942]  I've got other news here that is just so over the top, and I'm going to get to it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:23.027]  Owen Schroer, who was down there with some of the crew for two days as it hit, he's going to be in studio next hour.
[00:16:23.027 --> 00:16:28.391]  In the third hour, if he's able to get to higher ground and get on the broadcast,
[00:16:29.693 --> 00:16:42.056]  Let him know, Michael Zimmerman and crew, that if they need to stay out there on the boat saving people or they're getting powerful footage of, you know, alligators in people's swimming pools or whatever, or in their backyards or on top of their roofs, that he can stay out there.
[00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:46.477]  I mean, he can always come on the fourth hour or come on after he gets all the key intel.
[00:16:46.477 --> 00:16:56.440]  But again, we have a lot of exclusive video, a lot of exclusive articles, a lot of exclusive photos being posted to Infowars.com and Newswars.com right now.
[00:16:58.203 --> 00:17:01.944]  We have massive news also coming up dealing with the indictments.
[00:17:01.944 --> 00:17:05.445]  Now the Attorney General is doing his job and not being intimidated.
[00:17:05.445 --> 00:17:13.907]  Mueller subpoenas Podesta Group as firm, retroactively files more pro-Russia disclosures.
[00:17:13.907 --> 00:17:22.969]  So Mueller, trying to look like he's being fair, is ferreting into all the incredible Russia connections that the Clintons have, because there are none with Trump.
[00:17:22.969 --> 00:17:23.949]  That's up on News Wars.
[00:17:27.253 --> 00:17:39.161]  If you want to bring the globalists down, and I'll cover this later in the hour, this is the way to do it, because here's the deal.
[00:17:39.161 --> 00:17:52.791]  We're not talking about just a lawsuit like the ACLU is doing because the president is banning trans people from the military.
[00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:53.711]  That has no standing.
[00:17:53.711 --> 00:17:54.472]  It's going to get shot down.
[00:17:55.967 --> 00:17:57.039]  Regardless of what you think about it.
[00:17:58.314 --> 00:18:11.157]  This is completely different because Amazon, under an SPLC directive, just like SPLC now runs Google's systems blocking us, in many cases, they're on the board, in your data, in the Google interfaces.
[00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:20.300]  The SPLC, the famous folks that ran the Elohim City Nazi compound and more, I mean these are really bad people, that pose as a civil rights organization.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:25.501]  They're putting mainline Christian groups in databases where they can then not engage in commerce.
[00:18:26.207 --> 00:18:30.830]  Not have an area to sell their books on Amazon.
[00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:36.993]  Not be part of the Amazon platform where you go to an area to find charities.
[00:18:36.993 --> 00:18:42.436]  They're saying you're just not allowed access to a thing that is a monopoly that's even killing Main Street.
[00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:43.516]  It's killing Walmart.
[00:18:43.516 --> 00:18:45.597]  It's so tyrannical.
[00:18:45.597 --> 00:18:48.099]  And now it's expanding its monopoly.
[00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:54.636]  And they're telling Christians, you don't have a platform here.
[00:18:54.636 --> 00:18:56.999]  Christians are forced to sue.
[00:18:56.999 --> 00:19:01.164]  Because this is spreading and this database is being used everywhere.
[00:19:01.164 --> 00:19:04.127]  To put mainline Christian groups right next to Nazis.
[00:19:04.127 --> 00:19:09.914]  So you take the Nazis right to have free speech, now it's everybody.
[00:19:09.914 --> 00:19:10.135]  So...
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.204]  That's why I've said we're forced to sue, because the same stuff's happening to us.
[00:19:17.204 --> 00:19:23.209]  I'm not litigious, and I've been talking to a lot of top lawyers, and they say these are all very strong cases we have.
[00:19:23.209 --> 00:19:24.550]  In fact, they're open and shut.
[00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:36.398]  The Supreme Court, as they point out in this article, has already ruled that what Amazon is doing is illegal, what the SPLC is doing is classic, hardcore authoritarianism, like the Nazis did.
[00:19:36.398 --> 00:19:39.181]  In the 30s, first saying Jews couldn't have businesses,
[00:19:40.202 --> 00:19:40.923]  This is what you do.
[00:19:40.923 --> 00:19:44.268]  You first shut somebody off economically before you come after them completely.
[00:19:44.268 --> 00:19:46.832]  This is hardcore bare-knuckles attacks.
[00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:48.154]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:51.900]  I'm Alex Jones with the latest on Hurricane Harvey in the Gulf of Houston.
[00:19:58.803 --> 00:20:03.905]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:20:03.905 --> 00:20:09.627]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:20:09.627 --> 00:20:14.829]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:16.770]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.151]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.091]  See guidelines.
[00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:23.372]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[00:20:23.372 --> 00:20:25.333]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:20:25.333 --> 00:20:27.154]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:20:28.672 --> 00:20:30.573]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.

[00:20:35.397 --> 00:20:38.239]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:38.899]  Awesome.

[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.641]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.

[00:21:17.008 --> 00:21:22.112]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:21:22.112 --> 00:21:25.435]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:28.937]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:21:28.937 --> 00:21:31.898]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:21:31.898 --> 00:21:35.580]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:42.464]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.

[00:24:16.264 --> 00:24:20.187]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[00:24:20.187 --> 00:24:27.833]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:30.075]  Well, I've got a problem from Hurricane Harvey.
[00:24:31.256 --> 00:24:38.921]  And that's that the city of Austin, normally two million people, is like two and a half million, and the traffic now is almost round the clock.
[00:24:38.921 --> 00:24:39.822]  Worse has ever been.
[00:24:39.822 --> 00:24:55.252]  But thank God I've only got that problem with some of the Aquarian refugees from the flooded megacity that is Houston, named after the man that the Comanche and Cherokee Indians called the Raven, Sam Houston.
[00:24:57.608 --> 00:24:59.229]  Here's the big news.
[00:24:59.229 --> 00:25:01.992]  15 trillion gallons dumped on Houston.
[00:25:01.992 --> 00:25:04.974]  Many areas 20 feet underwater.
[00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:23.810]  And then I look at the despicable, dirtbag, evil nature of the Democratic Party leadership and how they take every crisis they can and make it as bad as they can to then blame Republicans or try to bankrupt different Republican or Libertarian or Christian states.
[00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.312]  It is truly sickening.
[00:25:26.704 --> 00:25:31.865]  Remember Obama with the fires that raged for months, a few years ago?
[00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:37.106]  Wouldn't send emergency aid to Texas from FEMA for months?
[00:25:37.106 --> 00:25:41.207]  Remember when we got hit by other hurricanes and Obama wouldn't declare an emergency?
[00:25:41.207 --> 00:25:42.608]  Period!
[00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:45.268]  And the media wouldn't say a word.
[00:25:45.268 --> 00:25:48.749]  That is how cold-blooded these people are.
[00:25:48.749 --> 00:25:52.530]  But when Democrat areas got hit, Bush sent FEMA.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.862]  The problem was, he'd order everybody else not to come and help.
[00:25:57.862 --> 00:26:02.065]  Like the Cajun Navy we see the police working with.
[00:26:02.065 --> 00:26:02.305]  R.D.
[00:26:02.305 --> 00:26:05.346]  Saveda doing a pretty good job down in Houston right now.
[00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:16.833]  I'd say doing a great job with the police battling some of the looters and saving thousands and thousands of people every hour who were told don't evacuate by the city's mayor.
[00:26:19.192 --> 00:26:29.461]  Because A, I guess he was hoping just the hurricane wouldn't hit Houston, even though it was scheduled to, and the forecaster said it was probably going to be the storm of all storms.
[00:26:29.461 --> 00:26:31.523]  And even four or five inches of rain, Houston will flood.
[00:26:33.274 --> 00:26:51.861]  Or is it because they wanted it to be the biggest disaster possible, hoping they could blame Trump, which they started doing Friday afternoon before the hurricane even hit Rockport, and hours and hours before it hit Houston, they were already saying Trump hasn't responded, he hasn't done a good enough job, knowing that you don't know, the average Democrat doesn't know.
[00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.312]  But the federal law and state law shows the governor has to request them in.
[00:26:56.312 --> 00:27:03.376]  And the minute they did, those trucks were already running and ready at the FEMA Center in North Texas outside Fort Worth.
[00:27:03.376 --> 00:27:11.520]  And we're already rolling out within one minute of the governor sending that letter digitally to the president.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.961]  Within one minute it's being reported.
[00:27:13.961 --> 00:27:14.942]  Trump was waiting.
[00:27:14.942 --> 00:27:15.422]  Boom!
[00:27:15.422 --> 00:27:16.042]  Got it.
[00:27:16.042 --> 00:27:16.823]  Executed.
[00:27:16.823 --> 00:27:17.823]  Made the phone call.
[00:27:17.823 --> 00:27:20.144]  Truck's rolling.
[00:27:20.144 --> 00:27:21.025]  And it's all his fault.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:35.427]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's even in the Associated Press that the mayor of the New Atlantis, Houston, that the mayor ordered a stand down.
[00:27:35.427 --> 00:27:38.269]  How sensational is that?
[00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:40.390]  Democrat mayor, why?
[00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:41.731]  Here's the question.
[00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:43.792]  Why did the Democrat mayor of Houston
[00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:51.942]  Order a stand down, because that's what it is to say we're not in an emergency and you don't even need to have an evacuation advisory.
[00:27:51.942 --> 00:27:53.985]  He didn't even have an evacuation advisory!
[00:27:55.205 --> 00:27:56.686]  He said, why would we do that?
[00:27:56.686 --> 00:27:57.767]  There's no point!
[00:27:57.767 --> 00:28:11.078]  You've just got a Category 2 at the time, became a Category 3, mega storm, full of water, coming right at one of the biggest cities in the United States, that's on low ground, and you decide to not even put people on alert.
[00:28:11.078 --> 00:28:19.825]  But, folks, they put people on alert, usually, for tropical storms!
[00:28:19.825 --> 00:28:22.808]  Trump meets and tweets as Texas governor praises Harvey response.
[00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:28.183]  Hurricane Harvey will render some parts of Texas uninhabitable for an extended period of time.
[00:28:28.183 --> 00:28:29.586]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:30.899 --> 00:28:31.820]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.022]  Texas Governor, major split over whether Houston needed evacuations.
[00:28:36.022 --> 00:28:49.649]  A split between Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner over whether the metropolis should have been evacuated is raising questions about officials' response to damaging floodwaters as the catastrophe continues to engulf the region.
[00:28:49.649 --> 00:28:55.292]  Mr. Turner, Democrat, and other local officials urge residents to stay in their homes.
[00:28:55.292 --> 00:28:56.353]  Did you hear that?
[00:28:57.233 --> 00:29:00.654]  And Governor Abbott said, get the hell out of there!
[00:29:00.654 --> 00:29:02.174]  And you know what the Democrats said?
[00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:03.774]  We're not gonna do it!
[00:29:03.774 --> 00:29:05.435]  We're not gonna do it!
[00:29:05.435 --> 00:29:07.055]  And we're gonna blame Trump!
[00:29:07.055 --> 00:29:08.715]  KKK, go away!
[00:29:08.715 --> 00:29:09.915]  Come back another day!
[00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:12.176]  I'm not kidding!
[00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:16.377]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this!
[00:29:16.377 --> 00:29:22.198]  Mr. Turner, Democrat, and other local officials urge residents to stay in their homes as Hurricane Harvey
[00:29:23.476 --> 00:29:27.076]  Which has since downgraded to tropical storm approached Houston on Friday.
[00:29:28.203 --> 00:29:33.624]  But Governor Abbott and Republicans suggested otherwise, saying, get out!
[00:29:33.624 --> 00:29:36.445]  But the Democrats don't listen to their enemy.
[00:29:36.445 --> 00:29:41.366]  That's why all over Twitter and Facebook, Democrats are celebrating the hurricane, saying, kill them rednecks!
[00:29:41.366 --> 00:29:42.226]  Wipe them out!
[00:29:42.226 --> 00:29:42.886]  Yeah!
[00:29:42.886 --> 00:29:46.267]  So stupid they don't know more than half the state in many areas is Democrat.
[00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:47.967]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[00:29:47.967 --> 00:29:49.368]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.368 --> 00:29:51.888]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.888 --> 00:29:54.589]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.516 --> 00:30:10.319]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[00:30:10.319 --> 00:30:12.880]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.341]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[00:30:16.341 --> 00:30:18.542]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[00:30:18.542 --> 00:30:23.364]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[00:30:23.364 --> 00:30:26.245]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[00:30:26.245 --> 00:30:28.686]  It's never been the price it is right now.
[00:30:28.686 --> 00:30:30.447]  With 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[00:30:33.328 --> 00:30:34.268]  Unprecedented.
[00:30:34.268 --> 00:30:35.469]  And it's cold-pressed.
[00:30:35.469 --> 00:30:37.409]  That's why Super Mayo is so different.
[00:30:37.409 --> 00:30:40.370]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science.
[00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.751]  These are other, what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:45.811]  It's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:47.011]  Why these aren't anything new?
[00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:51.072]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[00:30:51.072 --> 00:30:51.272]  Duh.
[00:30:51.272 --> 00:30:51.673]  Duh.
[00:30:58.644 --> 00:31:07.713]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:31:07.713 --> 00:31:16.121]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:20.805]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:33:15.436 --> 00:33:20.940]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:33.148]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.148 --> 00:33:37.831]  It all started on Friday at around 7 p.m.
[00:33:37.831 --> 00:33:38.832]  Again, it all started
[00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:42.550]  Last Friday at around 7 p.m.
[00:33:42.550 --> 00:34:09.249]  when Hurricane Harvey slammed in to the Texas coast around Corpus Christi and Rockport and then made its way north into Houston where three plus days later it's still sitting there dumping a record amount of water on the city.
[00:34:09.249 --> 00:34:10.130]  Meteorologist
[00:34:12.401 --> 00:34:40.934]  were very conclusive in their analysis and concurred with one another that there needed to be a citywide evacuation the governor and state emergency management officials begged the mayor and democrat city council to issue
[00:34:42.961 --> 00:34:46.742]  The emergency warning to evacuate.
[00:34:46.742 --> 00:35:06.790]  And the Democrat officials, according to the Houston Chronicle and the Associated Press and the Wall Street Journal, thumbed their noses at them, even though this was routine, even for a tropical storm, much less a Category 3, when it made landfall.
[00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.831]  Now, it's being called one of the worst
[00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.651]  Disasters in U.S.
[00:35:13.651 --> 00:35:18.795]  history, monetarily, and the death toll is beginning to mount.
[00:35:18.795 --> 00:35:29.304]  Images of people swimming inside nursing homes, people fishing inside their homes, alligators on people's front porches, literally going door-to-door trying to find high ground.
[00:35:29.304 --> 00:35:33.547]  And here's the story out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:35:33.547 --> 00:35:35.769]  Incredible!
[00:35:35.769 --> 00:35:39.092]  That the mayor ordered a stand-down.
[00:35:39.092 --> 00:35:39.773]  That's what that is.
[00:35:40.728 --> 00:35:46.793]  The governor says, under the Constitution, under law, you need to go ahead and declare it.
[00:35:46.793 --> 00:35:48.394]  We're looking at declaring it.
[00:35:48.394 --> 00:35:49.935]  Should we make it mandatory?
[00:35:49.935 --> 00:35:51.696]  Should we put out an advisory?
[00:35:51.696 --> 00:35:56.620]  The Democrats said, we don't want anything.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.582]  Not even an advisory.
[00:35:58.582 --> 00:36:00.223]  Not a mandatory, but an advisory.
[00:36:00.223 --> 00:36:02.385]  And that's following the Constitution.
[00:36:03.615 --> 00:36:07.799]  You saw Bush really screw up Katrina because he ordered FEMA to take full control.
[00:36:07.799 --> 00:36:09.521]  The locals knew where the people were.
[00:36:09.521 --> 00:36:11.643]  The locals knew how to get in and save folks.
[00:36:11.643 --> 00:36:19.671]  FEMA just secured the city like it was a military encampment and then the mass carnage then ensued and it also enabled the looting.
[00:36:20.762 --> 00:36:22.803]  That was a better response than Obama.
[00:36:22.803 --> 00:36:26.744]  He would just ignore hurricanes, not even show up at them.
[00:36:26.744 --> 00:36:39.088]  But now with Trump on the campaign trail last year, during the hurricane season, last fall, and again, this time, massive response the minute Abbott requested it.
[00:36:39.088 --> 00:36:46.850]  But you've got to ask yourself, why did the Democrat mayor of Houston order a stand down?
[00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.171]  Is it complete ineptness?
[00:36:51.112 --> 00:36:57.694]  Is it absolute low IQ?
[00:36:57.694 --> 00:37:01.995]  Is it arrogance?
[00:37:01.995 --> 00:37:04.636]  Total negligence?
[00:37:04.636 --> 00:37:08.257]  Or is it such a culture of hate for Democratic
[00:37:09.212 --> 00:37:18.435]  Constituents go out and shoot congressmen at baseball games and shoot their neighbor that moves in because they're a Republican City Council member and then the news doesn't even report on it.
[00:37:18.435 --> 00:37:25.096]  Or all the other attacks on conservatives or white people being stabbed because they have short haircuts and must be Nazis.
[00:37:25.096 --> 00:37:30.358]  Is it because there's such hysteria like we've seen on Twitter, like we covered over the weekend?
[00:37:30.358 --> 00:37:37.860]  Where there's thousands of tweets saying, kill Texas, hope God erases with a flood all those rednecks, hope Houston goes into the sea.
[00:37:41.923 --> 00:37:44.225]  But I guess in fairness, we've made the joke.
[00:37:44.225 --> 00:37:46.527]  Hopefully California falls off in the ocean.
[00:37:46.527 --> 00:37:47.667]  And what if it ever happens?
[00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:50.590]  I don't hope California falls off in the ocean.
[00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.092]  Even if it was all Democrats, I wouldn't hope that.
[00:37:53.092 --> 00:38:00.697]  But there's the ignorance of people actually cheering when the hurricane hits and the people are getting drowned, they're getting killed.
[00:38:00.697 --> 00:38:02.659]  They're cheering while it's happening.
[00:38:02.659 --> 00:38:08.864]  You know people wouldn't joke around if California actually fell off in the ocean and killed 30-something million people.
[00:38:08.864 --> 00:38:11.666]  Why, you know folks wouldn't be saying, yeah, great!
[00:38:11.926 --> 00:38:15.429]  California fell off!
[00:38:15.429 --> 00:38:17.311]  But see, careful what you joke about.
[00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:19.372]  I don't think I'm ever going to make that joke again.
[00:38:19.372 --> 00:38:24.416]  I didn't originate the joke, but I think we've all made the joke, haven't we, that California's so screwed up.
[00:38:24.416 --> 00:38:30.982]  But it's a beautiful state, a lot of great people, a very diverse crowd of folks, and they're going to wake up one day to their brainwashing.
[00:38:30.982 --> 00:38:37.367]  And so I pray there isn't ever a mega-earthquake and that pieces or parts or all of California doesn't fall off into the Pacific Ocean.
[00:38:39.042 --> 00:38:44.427]  Houston is basically an Atlantean city now, sinking into the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:38:44.427 --> 00:38:56.219]  Satellite photos that are on InfoWars.com and DrudgeReport.com show it from satellite, that you can see it looks like there's an inland bay now, basically.
[00:38:56.219 --> 00:38:59.202]  We've got radar on screen right now.
[00:38:59.202 --> 00:39:00.323]  Flood of a lifetime!
[00:39:00.323 --> 00:39:03.326]  50 plus inches, Harvey dumps
[00:39:05.324 --> 00:39:06.664]  15 trillion gallons of water.
[00:39:06.664 --> 00:39:07.985]  It was 11 trillion.
[00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:09.705]  Landmark event.
[00:39:09.705 --> 00:39:11.746]  Army Corps opens dams.
[00:39:11.746 --> 00:39:14.126]  Dramatic before and after photos.
[00:39:14.126 --> 00:39:15.246]  We've shown you that.
[00:39:15.246 --> 00:39:19.087]  FEMA expects 550,000 victims.
[00:39:19.087 --> 00:39:22.868]  30,000 in shelters.
[00:39:22.868 --> 00:39:24.469]  Why wasn't the city evacuated?
[00:39:24.469 --> 00:39:25.909]  That's a good question.
[00:39:25.909 --> 00:39:32.771]  First orders, given days after, told people to stay.
[00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:34.071]  Leaders defend themselves.
[00:39:36.398 --> 00:39:38.599]  12,000 Texas National Guard deployed.
[00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:40.639]  Cajun Navy mass mobilization.
[00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:46.161]  Just like Dunkirk, it's the average citizens taking charge that the police admit are doing 90% of the work.
[00:39:46.161 --> 00:39:48.041]  Because the cops can't handle something this big.
[00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:49.401]  The firefighters can't handle something this big.
[00:39:49.401 --> 00:39:53.602]  It's about the citizens working together, just like old civil defense.
[00:39:53.602 --> 00:39:55.023]  Island of fire ants.
[00:39:55.023 --> 00:39:56.223]  Oh yeah, that's powerful.
[00:39:56.223 --> 00:40:01.104]  Fire ants are an aquatic ant that live in the marshes of the Amazon.
[00:40:01.104 --> 00:40:03.325]  And they got up here to Houston, it's reported, back in the 40s.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:18.550]  And they're battling looters, everything else, but there's huge balls of the ants get together, so the ones on bottom die, the ones on top live, and you'll see a huge ball the size of a basketball or bigger.
[00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:19.351]  Look at that photo.
[00:40:19.351 --> 00:40:20.772]  That's way bigger than a basketball.
[00:40:20.772 --> 00:40:22.614]  That's like five basketballs.
[00:40:23.669 --> 00:40:28.393]  And notice the Queens get on top, while the males sit on bottom and die.
[00:40:28.393 --> 00:40:29.854]  Talk about a survival instinct.
[00:40:29.854 --> 00:40:31.776]  Talk about science fiction.
[00:40:31.776 --> 00:40:35.459]  I tell folks that aren't from the South or areas of the Fire Ants what they're like, they don't believe me.
[00:40:36.357 --> 00:40:37.478]  That's why stuff's flooding.
[00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:40.181]  Some of the worst fire ants bites I ever got when I was a kid.
[00:40:40.181 --> 00:40:47.388]  It'd be, you know, raining out for days and I'd go down to the creek or the local streams or the lake, you know, to play with my friends.
[00:40:47.388 --> 00:40:49.030]  It's always great on a rain day.
[00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:55.797]  When school would be out because of flooding, I'd go out and a few times I'd be going through a creek or something and boom, all the fire ants hit you.
[00:40:55.797 --> 00:40:59.260]  It is unbelievable.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:40:59.701]  Look at that.
[00:41:01.596 --> 00:41:03.237]  That is exactly what it's like.
[00:41:03.237 --> 00:41:04.357]  Well, that's it.
[00:41:04.357 --> 00:41:07.739]  So, you've got this hell going on.
[00:41:07.739 --> 00:41:11.180]  This makes Katrina look tame in the number of people affected.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.701]  Houston's 10 million.
[00:41:12.701 --> 00:41:14.182]  What's New Orleans, a million or something?
[00:41:16.906 --> 00:41:36.177]  But you're not going to see as much death because you've got the Cajun Navy, which is just citizens from all over the state, but particularly Louisiana, where they've got those type of boats that know how to navigate swamps, pouring in right now and saving people out of their houses who were told, don't worry, stay in your home or go up in your attic.
[00:41:38.814 --> 00:41:48.260]  But as the storm hit, firefighters warned, you better take an axe with you, because if the water starts rising, you're going to have to hack your way out.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.601]  So what are we learning from this?
[00:41:49.601 --> 00:41:58.887]  The citizens working together is the answer, not a nanny state telling everybody to stand down.
[00:41:58.887 --> 00:42:04.670]  And boy, they're going to have trouble now blaming
[00:42:05.925 --> 00:42:21.116]  Trump for this, and they've really got a problem of all these images of whites, Hispanics, blacks, you name it, working together, saving each other, and particularly images of evil white Texans and Louisianans out saving black folks, Hispanics, and others.
[00:42:21.116 --> 00:42:31.064]  That image of people hauling each other into the boats, or that image about a month ago of the truck flipping and the families in it, and the black guys and the white guys pull over together and swim down in there and get the family out.
[00:42:31.744 --> 00:42:33.325]  Get him out to safety, that image.
[00:42:33.325 --> 00:42:53.755]  The globalists hate that image, because everybody's being affected together by these storms, and by earthquakes, and by volcanoes, and by disease, and by war, and by crime, and by bad economies, and Trump understands that, and is really trying to give the globalists a run for their money, but he's surrounded by all these cowards, who all want to hedge their bets,
[00:42:55.273 --> 00:42:59.498]  And protect themselves and act like their establishment and run up the little white flag.
[00:42:59.498 --> 00:43:04.304]  Rex Tillerson is bad-mouthing Trump everywhere.
[00:43:04.304 --> 00:43:06.226]  McMaster's running him down in public.
[00:43:06.226 --> 00:43:07.428]  They're all doing it.
[00:43:07.428 --> 00:43:10.631]  I've got video clips today because they're cowards.
[00:43:11.994 --> 00:43:19.577]  They see the wall of demonization, the wall of peer pressure, the attacks, and they don't want somebody yelling at them at the grocery store.
[00:43:19.577 --> 00:43:21.117]  The Democrats have put the order out.
[00:43:21.117 --> 00:43:26.899]  Yell at people, get in their face, spit at them, throw urine on them, throw coffee on them, attack them.
[00:43:26.899 --> 00:43:29.300]  And the average coward just wants to be in power.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.801]  They don't actually want to fight for the people or stand up for something.
[00:43:31.801 --> 00:43:36.523]  So they're all rolling over except for Trump's wife and Trump's sons.
[00:43:38.373 --> 00:43:44.916]  But everybody else is rolling over with their big yellow bellies.
[00:43:44.916 --> 00:43:46.617]  They like walking the red carpet.
[00:43:46.617 --> 00:43:49.819]  By the way, Trump's a rock star all over Asia.
[00:43:49.819 --> 00:43:51.359]  They respect him in the Middle East.
[00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:54.201]  They respect him in Eastern Europe, in Russia, in Latin America.
[00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:54.961]  They like him.
[00:43:54.961 --> 00:43:56.282]  They see what he's up against.
[00:43:56.282 --> 00:43:58.523]  They know our media is corporate.
[00:43:58.523 --> 00:44:00.424]  They know it's run by the bad guys.
[00:44:00.424 --> 00:44:04.246]  And they know that whole system's the corrupt pope, everything.
[00:44:04.246 --> 00:44:06.947]  The Chinese communists are pointed at our president.
[00:44:08.314 --> 00:44:10.795]  How could I not want to fully support him?
[00:44:10.795 --> 00:44:19.079]  Because this is everything I've ever wanted to do, is stand up against peer pressure and do what's right.
[00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:25.822]  Trump reportedly called Gary Cohen, the poor baby, a globalist to his face.
[00:44:25.822 --> 00:44:28.303]  Thinks Rex Tillerson is too establishment.
[00:44:28.303 --> 00:44:30.864]  Yeah, The Week magazine is reporting that.
[00:44:30.864 --> 00:44:31.324]  Absolutely.
[00:44:31.324 --> 00:44:35.806]  And then they all threatened to quit and leak stuff to the press, you know, about Trump.
[00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.267]  What a pack of cowards.
[00:44:38.319 --> 00:45:01.916]  Well he's up there taking all the lies, taking all the attacks, having all his businesses attacked, being sued thousands of times, watching his wealth destroyed, but he knows he's getting the real wealth of restoring the republic for the future and standing up to a bunch of parasites that when they're finally defeated, whether Donald Trump lives to see it or not, he's going to go down as the second George Washington if he stays the course.
[00:45:04.923 --> 00:45:06.883]  But let's get back to the big news.
[00:45:06.883 --> 00:45:08.544]  Texas Governor!
[00:45:08.544 --> 00:45:12.184]  Major split over whether Houston needed evacuations.
[00:45:12.184 --> 00:45:16.625]  How about Democrats order stand down in Houston?
[00:45:16.625 --> 00:45:18.986]  Why?
[00:45:18.986 --> 00:45:24.207]  Because they wouldn't work with Republicans and they want to make the disaster as bad as possible.
[00:45:24.207 --> 00:45:29.748]  Because they know the corporate whore media will blame it on Trump and Governor Abbott.
[00:45:29.748 --> 00:45:30.268]  Period.
[00:45:30.268 --> 00:45:34.229]  I bet my bottom dollar there's even emails
[00:45:35.236 --> 00:45:39.318]  To the different foundations and the Soros Group and others and the Democrats and Podesta.
[00:45:39.318 --> 00:45:44.961]  Because we've seen them in past events order stand downs and do things like this to try to make people look bad.
[00:45:44.961 --> 00:45:55.126]  I mean, why else when all the meteorologists are saying, storm of the century, maybe the storm of the last 500 years, it's going to totally flood the city, it's going to T-bone it, it's going to stall.
[00:45:55.126 --> 00:45:59.508]  We believe because of pressure systems, pressure maps over Houston.
[00:45:59.508 --> 00:46:01.429]  It stalled there for three days.
[00:46:01.429 --> 00:46:04.251]  It may be there for two more days as a tropical storm.
[00:46:05.649 --> 00:46:10.530]  Dumping feet and feet and feet every few hours.
[00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:13.911]  And they don't even issue a voluntary evacuation.
[00:46:13.911 --> 00:46:16.811]  And they were real pissy to the governor about it back on Thursday and Friday.
[00:46:16.811 --> 00:46:18.112]  Oh, why do we need to do that?
[00:46:18.112 --> 00:46:20.512]  Don't tell us what to do, Abbott!
[00:46:20.512 --> 00:46:23.353]  That is sensational!
[00:46:23.353 --> 00:46:28.714]  But you watch when they start finding the dead bodies and the response bogs down, because how do you respond to something this big?
[00:46:28.714 --> 00:46:29.814]  It's not going to go perfect.
[00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:39.198]  Can you imagine if they didn't let the tens of thousands of boats in there of citizens doing the right thing, going to rescue people?
[00:46:39.198 --> 00:46:42.943]  Just like their grandpas and parents got saved by other folks when they got flooded.
[00:46:44.602 --> 00:46:45.943]  Don't you know?
[00:46:45.943 --> 00:46:51.406]  It could bring the economy down to have Houston stalled, the refinery stalled, and millions of people stuck in their houses.
[00:46:51.406 --> 00:46:52.287]  Millions.
[00:46:52.287 --> 00:46:53.507]  Millions and millions.
[00:46:53.507 --> 00:46:56.969]  Of 10 million people, they're saying maybe 2 million evacuated.
[00:46:56.969 --> 00:47:10.017]  You got 8 million people cut off, the store is empty, a virtual hellhole, and if it wasn't for Trump and the governor standing back and saying, let the citizens in, free market-wise, this thing would be 100 times worse.
[00:47:10.017 --> 00:47:11.418]  But you watch.
[00:47:11.418 --> 00:47:13.339]  In a couple days, you're going to hear it's Trump's fault.
[00:47:13.339 --> 00:47:13.920]  It's already started.
[00:47:14.929 --> 00:47:21.253]  And as they find the dead bodies, they're going to put people on TV bitching that FEMA didn't get there quick enough.
[00:47:21.253 --> 00:47:24.075]  As if FEMA could always just be there for whatever you wanted it to do.
[00:47:24.075 --> 00:47:28.639]  It was really set up to have a COG takeover of government.
[00:47:28.639 --> 00:47:33.242]  Trump is actually using it to help, but he sat back and waited for the governor to ask.
[00:47:33.242 --> 00:47:38.926]  He didn't come in like they did in New Orleans, again a Democrat city, and have a federal takeover.
[00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:57.030]  A split between Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner over whether the metropolis should have been evacuated is raising questions about officials' response to the damaging floodwaters as the catastrophe continues to engulf the region.
[00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:03.553]  Mr. Turner, a Democrat, and other local officials urged residents to stay in their homes.
[00:48:03.553 --> 00:48:12.518]  Urged residents to stay in their homes as Hurricane Harvey, which has since downgraded to a tropical storm, approached Houston Friday.
[00:48:12.518 --> 00:48:26.566]  But even as Friday's news conference, Governor Abbott, a Republican, suggested otherwise, even if an evacuation order hasn't been issued by your local officials, if you're in the area between Corpus Christi and Houston, you need to strongly consider evacuating.
[00:48:29.514 --> 00:48:31.474]  It's like a tornado is coming right for your house.
[00:48:31.474 --> 00:48:33.075]  And it's like saying, go play in your front yard.
[00:48:33.075 --> 00:48:34.315]  That's what the Democrats are saying.
[00:48:34.315 --> 00:48:37.276]  Abbott's like, get to your storm shelter or get to a bathroom.
[00:48:37.276 --> 00:48:38.776]  Get away from windows.
[00:48:38.776 --> 00:48:42.297]  The Democrats are like, oh, shut up, you Republican pig.
[00:48:42.297 --> 00:48:43.437]  Everything's fine.
[00:48:43.437 --> 00:48:46.057]  Everybody go out, have a party.
[00:48:46.057 --> 00:48:52.399]  By Sunday, the storm had poured as much as 24 inches in 24 hours onto areas that had been soaked the previous day.
[00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:53.579]  Five fatalities and reported.
[00:48:53.579 --> 00:48:54.719]  It just goes on from there.
[00:48:54.719 --> 00:48:58.500]  A total gigantor train wreck, car wreck.
[00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:08.773]  And you've got the Democrats now in the news defending themselves.
[00:49:08.773 --> 00:49:09.333]  Unbelievable.
[00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:11.094]  Leaders defend.
[00:49:11.094 --> 00:49:14.635]  Houston area officials defend decision not to evacuate ahead of Harvey.
[00:49:14.635 --> 00:49:16.255]  Nonsensical thing to do.
[00:49:16.255 --> 00:49:17.296]  Yeah, guys, grab me that video.
[00:49:17.296 --> 00:49:17.996]  I want to play that.
[00:49:17.996 --> 00:49:24.298]  A nonsensical thing to do.
[00:49:24.298 --> 00:49:25.078]  Houston Chronicle.
[00:49:25.078 --> 00:49:26.819]  New York Daily News.
[00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:30.158]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:49:30.158 --> 00:49:52.523]  We're going to go to break, I'm going to come back, and I'm going to get into this more, and then I'm going to get into all over the EU and all over the UK, they're taking Christian children and giving them on purpose the most hardcore burka-wearing Muslims, because that's what you do in the US and the UK, is in Democrat-run cities, the Muslims don't work.
[00:49:52.523 --> 00:49:56.064]  Sometimes they own a business, but what they do is they have foster kids.
[00:49:57.086 --> 00:49:59.007]  It's a big joke.
[00:49:59.007 --> 00:50:00.688]  Not in this case so far, but in others.
[00:50:00.688 --> 00:50:02.769]  They sell them into sex slavery, you name it.
[00:50:02.769 --> 00:50:07.871]  And I mean, we're talking about six, seven, eight year old kids that were with their parents because, you know, mom was drinking and driving or something.
[00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:17.216]  Well, they take the kid away and then you go to a Muslim household, a burka goes on your head, your cross is taken, and you were taught how to live the halal life.
[00:50:17.216 --> 00:50:18.357]  That's Times of London.
[00:50:18.357 --> 00:50:21.918]  Christian child forced into Muslim foster care.
[00:50:21.918 --> 00:50:22.358]  Boom.
[00:50:22.358 --> 00:50:24.980]  Infowars.com right now.
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:25.340]  Right now.
[00:50:26.488 --> 00:50:36.673]  And I've had members of Parliament on from the UK, Liberal members of Parliament going, Alex, you gotta see it, it's mainly Muslims in the government system.
[00:50:36.673 --> 00:50:40.335]  They're the foster care, they're the truancy officers, they're the CPS.
[00:50:40.335 --> 00:50:42.516]  So they come, find that you've done wrong, and then they...
[00:50:46.391 --> 00:50:48.013]  Then we're like, oh, don't be Islamophobic.
[00:50:48.013 --> 00:50:54.179]  Oh, in England now, and in the U.S., you're being kicked out of college, or you're getting in trouble if you criticize ISIS.
[00:50:54.179 --> 00:50:56.281]  That's now officially Islamophobic.
[00:50:56.281 --> 00:50:57.402]  I'm not kidding.
[00:50:57.402 --> 00:50:57.762]  We'll do that.
[00:50:57.762 --> 00:50:58.663]  Stay with us.

[00:51:00.324 --> 00:51:01.706]  How about our banking system?
[00:51:02.026 --> 00:51:09.210]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now, and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.
[00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.591]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now.

[00:53:30.063 --> 00:53:33.165]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[00:53:33.165 --> 00:53:33.746]  At home.
[00:53:33.746 --> 00:53:34.386]  At work.
[00:53:34.386 --> 00:53:35.207]  In the car.

[00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:56.702]  Effective.
[00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:25.451]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:54:25.451 --> 00:54:28.112]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:54:28.112 --> 00:54:33.914]  You know, the globalists are like gremlins.
[00:54:33.914 --> 00:54:39.835]  They're really good at taking things over and then sabotaging things and basically crapping all over it.
[00:54:39.835 --> 00:54:44.957]  And any city Democrats run just descends into hell overnight.
[00:54:44.957 --> 00:54:49.618]  New York, Chicago, LA, DC, Detroit.
[00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:58.633]  Places like Seattle, beautiful city, great history, founded by super hardcore miners, fishermen, loggers.
[00:54:58.633 --> 00:55:05.056]  I mean, super rough, way rougher than, you know, the classic Texas ethos that you think about of ranchers or something.
[00:55:06.337 --> 00:55:11.998]  Now you go there, it's, I mean, it is like a fog of demon hangs over it.
[00:55:11.998 --> 00:55:17.179]  There's human feces everywhere, people cussing at each other, screaming at each other, just nasty.
[00:55:17.179 --> 00:55:19.240]  In amongst really nice people.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:28.462]  The majority are really nice, but the per capita percentage, though it's a low number, of nasties, maybe two out of ten are like just
[00:55:29.721 --> 00:55:32.282]  And I think it's the attitude of the heroin.
[00:55:32.282 --> 00:55:40.444]  They've taken so much heroin, a lot of them are off the heroin, but their receptors are all fried, and they're just super depressed.
[00:55:40.444 --> 00:55:44.306]  That's what heroin addiction does, it fries your brain.
[00:55:44.306 --> 00:55:55.209]  And it's like, you want to see what an opium den nightmare Edgar Allen Poe's like, you add that with the rain, the dreariness, all of it of Seattle, you got a hateful group of people right there, buddy.
[00:55:57.188 --> 00:56:02.630]  And it's so incredibly sad that we've gotten to this point.
[00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.571]  And now Houston.
[00:56:04.571 --> 00:56:07.713]  Big, industrial, rough city.
[00:56:07.713 --> 00:56:10.174]  Rough city.
[00:56:10.174 --> 00:56:10.774]  Tough city.
[00:56:10.774 --> 00:56:14.135]  Got a lot of family down there.
[00:56:14.135 --> 00:56:16.316]  Basically energized Texas.
[00:56:16.316 --> 00:56:19.378]  Did a lot of the heavy lifting.
[00:56:19.378 --> 00:56:19.878]  Still does.
[00:56:20.987 --> 00:56:24.489]  Kind of the engine of Texas is in the water.
[00:56:24.489 --> 00:56:26.610]  It's in the mud up to its axles.
[00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:31.333]  The Democrats are all over Facebook and Twitter celebrating it as if Texas is their enemy.
[00:56:31.333 --> 00:56:38.237]  They don't get if Texas was to actually collapse, the economy collapses, that they're cheering for, that's going to hurt them as well.
[00:56:38.237 --> 00:56:43.520]  And the Democrat mayor and Democratic officials made fun of the governor.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.701]  And they said, we don't need your help.
[00:56:45.701 --> 00:56:46.562]  The quote was,
[00:56:49.904 --> 00:57:00.509]  Nonsensical thing to do to issue an evacuation order or to even recommend one.
[00:57:00.509 --> 00:57:07.153]  And they told the governor that he was nonsensical, that he was, it was just nonsense.
[00:57:07.153 --> 00:57:12.496]  That's why they have the evacuation corridors, that's why they have it all set up.
[00:57:12.496 --> 00:57:13.076]  But the mayor
[00:57:15.322 --> 00:57:18.685]  Says it's nonsensical, and well, he's the boss.
[00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:31.519]  You know, I say it makes a lot of sense to bring in 10 million military-age men under a UN program, put them in as the social workers, and start taking the Brits, and the Germans, and the Swedes' kids, and putting them in Muslim households.
[00:57:31.519 --> 00:57:32.099]  Like you're doing!
[00:57:32.099 --> 00:57:37.345]  I reported that five years ago when nobody else was, and I couldn't believe it then.
[00:57:38.677 --> 00:57:47.820]  That Paul Watson was getting me members of parliament on, because nobody would talk about how they were also taking the little girls and sexualizing them, and finally five years later, that all broke.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:56.763]  Some towns, up to three, four, five, six, seven thousand little girls grabbed, raped, and the police will do nothing because a large contingent are Muslims!
[00:57:56.763 --> 00:57:58.124]  The others are pedophiles!
[00:58:00.987 --> 00:58:02.929]  And now the Sunday Times.
[00:58:02.929 --> 00:58:05.831]  Christian children forced into Muslim foster care.
[00:58:05.831 --> 00:58:07.532]  You know, I'm spending 30 seconds doing this.
[00:58:07.532 --> 00:58:08.813]  I should have spent the whole hour.
[00:58:08.813 --> 00:58:10.234]  We need to fund our operation.
[00:58:10.234 --> 00:58:13.497]  We have a limited time mega special on Supermail Vitality.
[00:58:13.497 --> 00:58:23.265]  We'll have to stop it very soon because at this rate of sales it will sell out because we're doing it 57% off Supermail Vitality and that's off the regularly discounted price.
[00:58:23.265 --> 00:58:24.145]  That is unbelievable.
[00:58:25.026 --> 00:58:25.586]  Parallel.
[00:58:25.586 --> 00:58:26.886]  Try it for yourself.
[00:58:26.886 --> 00:58:30.207]  Also, we have X2 and Selenium individually or combo'd.
[00:58:30.207 --> 00:58:31.628]  45% off.
[00:58:31.628 --> 00:58:32.808]  A massive sale.
[00:58:32.808 --> 00:58:33.948]  Free shipping on order.
[00:58:33.948 --> 00:58:34.348]  $3 or more.
[00:58:34.348 --> 00:58:35.209]  Sign up for auto.
[00:58:35.209 --> 00:58:36.469]  Ship an additional 10% off.
[00:58:36.469 --> 00:58:40.110]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:40.990]  We're defending you.
[00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:43.131]  We need your support now more than ever.
[00:58:43.131 --> 00:58:43.871]  Thank you for your support.
[00:58:49.807 --> 00:58:54.533]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:58:54.533 --> 00:59:04.066]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors
[00:59:04.246 --> 00:59:04.486]  I think?
[00:59:23.655 --> 00:59:24.335]  We're good.
[00:59:52.225 --> 00:59:55.566]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:55.566 --> 01:00:17.694]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star!
[01:00:17.694 --> 01:00:20.215]  We now take you live to the edge of the ocean.
[01:00:22.176 --> 01:00:24.978]  Austin, Texas.
[01:00:24.978 --> 01:00:31.504]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:33.886]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:50.796]  We got Owen Schroyer who spent two days with our intrepid crew down on the coast in and around Houston.
[01:00:50.796 --> 01:00:56.799]  We have the footage of the fronts of buildings blown off, the stop signs bent down to the ground, buildings thrown on top of each other.
[01:00:56.799 --> 01:01:04.524]  But now we've got footage coming in as he's able to upload it by Michael Zimmerman who didn't wait for orders from headquarters.
[01:01:04.524 --> 01:01:08.426]  He just went down there in my truck and with a kayak
[01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:14.792]  And so he's down there getting powerful footage back when he's able to get internet.
[01:01:14.792 --> 01:01:18.253]  So he basically goes in and drives back out, uploads it, and drives back in.
[01:01:18.253 --> 01:01:23.255]  So he's in the middle of those rescue efforts right now.
[01:01:23.255 --> 01:01:24.215]  That is all coming up.
[01:01:24.215 --> 01:01:27.216]  The Gulf of Houston!
[01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:36.140]  20 foot plus deep water in many areas of the city, way more than 50 inches, have fallen 15 trillion gallons.
[01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:44.534]  15 trillion gallons.
[01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.395]  Now let's go back to InfoWars.com.
[01:01:46.395 --> 01:01:48.836]  Here's some of the stories.
[01:01:48.836 --> 01:01:52.979]  CNN's Acosta gets owned up for tweeting fake news, hurricane warning.
[01:01:54.761 --> 01:02:00.125]  New study finds Muslims and leftists responsible for vast majority of anti-semitic hate crime.
[01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:04.229]  That's really not a... You need a study for that?
[01:02:04.229 --> 01:02:06.851]  But then they blame right-wingers for being anti-semitic.
[01:02:06.851 --> 01:02:10.153]  Trump faces major tests as hurricane slams Texas.
[01:02:10.153 --> 01:02:17.299]  And again, that's the David Knight's analysis and show of that.
[01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:20.582]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a big story
[01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:25.792]  Going up.
[01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:27.272]  I thought those stories looked old.
[01:02:27.272 --> 01:02:29.613]  That was cached when I went to InfoWars.
[01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:31.613]  It didn't load the new stuff.
[01:02:31.613 --> 01:02:33.174]  I was like, man, this is really weird.
[01:02:33.174 --> 01:02:33.674]  There it is.
[01:02:33.674 --> 01:02:39.695]  Now it's loaded the new stories on InfoWars.com.
[01:02:39.695 --> 01:02:44.417]  There's a lot of really, really important articles up on the site right now.
[01:02:45.734 --> 01:02:49.295]  University accuses a student of Islamophobia for mocking ISIS.
[01:02:49.295 --> 01:02:50.295]  That's right.
[01:02:50.295 --> 01:02:51.636]  May get kicked out of college.
[01:02:51.636 --> 01:03:03.480]  Hell, you get arrested in Germany for that if you criticize ISIS because they're not Islamic when they kill you or put you in a sex slavery or cut your genitals off even though they're following the Quran.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:10.502]  But then if you criticize them, you get in trouble at the University of Edinburgh because, well, it's Islamophobia because he mocked the Islamic State.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:23.164]  Robbie Travers, who's also a commentator with the Gatestone Institute, let's get him on, posted to Facebook another individual at the college reported him to campus authorities for making fun of a terror group.
[01:03:23.164 --> 01:03:24.385]  Gosh!
[01:03:24.385 --> 01:03:25.805]  People say, oh, well, I better not do that.
[01:03:25.805 --> 01:03:37.010]  No, it's now time to get more politically incorrect, folks, because I've got stacks of news articles here where, like we covered last week, they sent a Twitter out
[01:03:41.035 --> 01:03:46.860]  The ACLU did, showing a white baby, talking about America's future.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:55.626]  And then they took it down and apologized when their constituents, their supporters, their users, their fans, said, this is white.
[01:03:55.626 --> 01:03:56.607]  White is not the future.
[01:03:56.607 --> 01:03:57.248]  Whites are bad.
[01:03:57.248 --> 01:03:57.908]  Let's kill whites.
[01:03:57.908 --> 01:03:59.169]  Let's get rid of them.
[01:03:59.169 --> 01:03:59.850]  They said, you know what?
[01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:00.350]  You're right.
[01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:01.051]  We agree with you.
[01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:02.832]  They didn't say, man, you're mentally ill.
[01:04:02.832 --> 01:04:04.813]  You've really become racist yourself.
[01:04:04.813 --> 01:04:05.354]  What's wrong with you?
[01:04:05.354 --> 01:04:08.536]  They said, you know, thank you for teaching us.
[01:04:08.536 --> 01:04:08.957]  Thank you for
[01:04:10.211 --> 01:04:28.996]  Oh, and Muslim families are just like everybody else's family, so let's give little Christian kids we take away from their parents, even 8 years old, let's take their crosses away and put a burqa on them and give them to a Muslim family who then tells them that Jesus Christ is a piece of garbage.
[01:04:28.996 --> 01:04:31.177]  That's the times of London.
[01:04:31.177 --> 01:04:35.678]  This is just straight up now, should we be giving 8 year olds to Muslims?
[01:04:37.017 --> 01:04:41.061]  Who then tell them, you know, that their culture's evil and that Christianity's bad.
[01:04:41.061 --> 01:04:43.504]  And by the way, sweetheart, we're gonna put a burqa over your head.
[01:04:43.504 --> 01:04:47.188]  Maybe they'll marry her off when she's nine years old under Islam.
[01:04:47.188 --> 01:04:47.688]  You can do that.
[01:04:47.688 --> 01:04:50.872]  I mean, it's a peace be upon the prophet and everything else.
[01:04:50.872 --> 01:04:51.472]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:51.472 --> 01:04:51.873]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.825]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[01:05:06.825 --> 01:05:09.367]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[01:05:09.367 --> 01:05:12.830]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:15.031]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:19.855]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[01:05:19.855 --> 01:05:22.737]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[01:05:22.737 --> 01:05:26.940]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:30.743]  Unprecedented.
[01:05:30.743 --> 01:05:31.963]  And it's cold-pressed.
[01:05:31.963 --> 01:05:33.884]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[01:05:33.884 --> 01:05:36.865]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science.
[01:05:36.865 --> 01:05:40.247]  These are other, what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[01:05:40.247 --> 01:05:42.308]  It's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[01:05:42.308 --> 01:05:43.508]  Why these aren't anything new?
[01:05:43.508 --> 01:05:47.770]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:48.190]  Duh.
[01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:48.250]  Duh.
[01:05:56.775 --> 01:06:00.538]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:06:00.538 --> 01:06:08.263]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:06:08.263 --> 01:06:16.908]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:06:16.908 --> 01:06:21.291]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:26.715]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:06:26.895 --> 01:06:31.117]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:34.538]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:06:34.538 --> 01:06:45.683]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:06:45.683 --> 01:06:48.584]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:06:48.584 --> 01:06:54.567]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:06:55.407 --> 01:07:04.133]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:07:04.133 --> 01:07:04.673]  That's right.
[01:07:04.673 --> 01:07:09.937]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.

[01:07:16.621 --> 01:07:23.866]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:24.426]  Woo!
[01:07:24.426 --> 01:07:25.467]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:25.467 --> 01:07:34.191]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:07:34.191 --> 01:07:43.796]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:07:43.796 --> 01:07:47.238]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:07:47.238 --> 01:07:51.360]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.201]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:07:52.421 --> 01:08:06.548]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:08:06.548 --> 01:08:10.990]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:12.431]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:40.034]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide now into hour number two.
[01:08:40.034 --> 01:08:44.917]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, you'll be riding shotgun with me, Owen Schroyer sitting to my right.
[01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:53.885]  We're going to have Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief joining us, real geopolitical expert with amazing gravitas, to give us his take on Trump's big pivot.
[01:08:54.725 --> 01:09:00.548]  Back into the situation in America's longest war, almost 17 years in Afghanistan.
[01:09:00.548 --> 01:09:02.969]  We'll just spend 10 minutes on that or so.
[01:09:02.969 --> 01:09:13.854]  Then I'm going to open the phones up for people specifically who are here in Texas and Louisiana to give us their take on what they're witnessing, what they've gone through, what they think about what's happening.
[01:09:13.854 --> 01:09:15.415]  But here's the big news.
[01:09:15.415 --> 01:09:20.877]  This is out of the New York Daily News, the Houston Chronicle, the Associated Press, the Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:20.877 --> 01:09:22.318]  These are real quotes.
[01:09:23.376 --> 01:09:25.337]  These are real quotes.
[01:09:25.337 --> 01:09:40.768]  The mayor called it nonsensical and stupid, not just last Thursday and Friday, when Abbott came out, the governor of Texas, and said, you need to order an evacuation.
[01:09:40.768 --> 01:09:45.211]  And if you're not going to order a full evacuation, you need to say that there's an advisory.
[01:09:45.211 --> 01:09:51.276]  And then when the Houston's leaders wouldn't do it, who were Democrats, Democrats sitting out, what did they do?
[01:09:53.086 --> 01:09:54.487]  What did they do?
[01:09:54.487 --> 01:10:01.711]  They made jokes about it and called it nonsensical and said that it wasn't needed.
[01:10:01.711 --> 01:10:04.033]  There it is, New York Daily News.
[01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:09.536]  Houston area officials defend decision not to evacuate ahead of Harvey.
[01:10:09.536 --> 01:10:12.158]  Nonsensical thing to do.
[01:10:12.158 --> 01:10:18.522]  This is so over the top, I don't know what to think because Democrats, I've noticed, are big mainstream media people.
[01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:27.803]  And they believe the buck stops, starts, you name it, with the comedy shows that masquerade as news shows.
[01:10:27.803 --> 01:10:32.585]  They're starting a new one this week, five nights a week on Comedy Central, misrepresenting who I am.
[01:10:32.585 --> 01:10:35.446]  I guess hoping I get killed or something.
[01:10:35.446 --> 01:10:46.649]  So their main news programs are actors reading off teleprompters who pose as comics so they don't get their butts sued into oblivion as they steal people's identities and then commit cultural crimes in their names.
[01:10:47.901 --> 01:10:49.142]  So, what are they doing?
[01:10:49.142 --> 01:11:07.898]  Well, the same way they sabotage culture, the same way they admit with Cloward and Pippen they want to bankrupt the nation, the same way it came out in lawsuits this year that they want to bankrupt Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that small-time business owners and blue-collar workers can't have a home and have the American dream.
[01:11:07.898 --> 01:11:12.081]  It's all about getting control, Owen, and that's what they've done.
[01:11:12.081 --> 01:11:16.044]  So I ask you the question, is he just completely negligent?
[01:11:16.044 --> 01:11:16.585]  Insane?
[01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:20.880]  The mayor there?
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:29.865]  Or is Sylvester Turner conscious of what he's doing, and they're wanting to blame Trump so they want to make the disaster as bad as possible?
[01:11:29.865 --> 01:11:37.569]  Because George W. Bush sent in FEMA, but then wouldn't let any of the locals help, so it was a bigger disaster.
[01:11:37.569 --> 01:11:42.311]  Obama just wouldn't even go to hurricanes, and hardly sent any help, and just let locals deal with it.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:57.493]  Trump is aiding the locals, absolutely empowering everybody, and they're calling this the best response ever across the board, except for some Democrats making jokes saying, we hope Texas and Rednecks get wiped off the map, not even knowing it's a Democrat city now, and they are
[01:11:58.917 --> 01:12:07.143]  Blaming Trump, saying he sent out a video wishing everybody well and prayers on Friday, saying they didn't, that he didn't direct them on what to do.
[01:12:07.143 --> 01:12:08.764]  The president doesn't do that.
[01:12:08.764 --> 01:12:12.066]  It's the, it's the county, it's the city, it's the emergency management.
[01:12:12.066 --> 01:12:15.169]  They call on the governor, then he calls on the president.
[01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:16.289]  That's called a republic.
[01:12:16.289 --> 01:12:18.091]  It's called separation of powers.
[01:12:18.091 --> 01:12:20.172]  It's called jurisdiction.
[01:12:20.172 --> 01:12:20.933]  But there, again,
[01:12:22.091 --> 01:12:25.292]  Is it complete ineptitude or is it part of a plan?
[01:12:25.292 --> 01:12:26.573]  They know how deadly these are.
[01:12:26.573 --> 01:12:29.294]  They know what the meteorologist unanimously said.
[01:12:29.294 --> 01:12:30.514]  It's going to hit Houston.
[01:12:30.514 --> 01:12:31.835]  It's going to stall over Houston.
[01:12:31.835 --> 01:12:35.076]  Could be the worst storm ever recorded in a major city in the U.S.
[01:12:35.076 --> 01:12:37.017]  It's now, looks like it's that.
[01:12:37.017 --> 01:12:42.619]  Ten million people in Houston, only two million evacuated because the Democrats told them, don't evacuate.
[01:12:42.619 --> 01:12:42.879]  In fact,
[01:12:43.649 --> 01:12:45.530]  Guys, I saw this Friday and Thursday.
[01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:53.752]  Will you guys go online, go to YouTube, type in, city officials in Houston say don't evacuate or no need to evacuate, say city officials.
[01:12:53.752 --> 01:12:58.014]  Because I know we have the quotes here, but I want the video of where they said it.
[01:12:58.014 --> 01:13:01.755]  I mean, they're in a new article saying, I mean, there's new press conferences.
[01:13:01.755 --> 01:13:03.115]  So this side's busy.
[01:13:03.115 --> 01:13:07.537]  Whoever's on the other production side, I need those clips.
[01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:23.159]  Because it's one thing me saying this, they'll probably have Colbert go, Jones lied again and said unicorns were seen swimming in the Houston Ship Channel, and that alligators were coming off flying saucers, and that the mayor didn't declare an emergency or tell folks to evacuate.
[01:13:23.159 --> 01:13:23.981]  Because that's the tactic.
[01:13:25.148 --> 01:13:25.668]  That's the tactic.
[01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:39.160]  I mean, there's articles, hundreds of them a day, saying Jones, who normally covers space aliens and flying saucers, which we never talk about, uh, Jones, uh, you know, who said that the moon landings didn't happen, never said that.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.283]  Jones, who says he hates black people, never said that.
[01:13:42.283 --> 01:13:47.247]  Jones, who's the most racist person in America, never said that.
[01:13:47.247 --> 01:13:49.589]  This is how they operate.
[01:13:49.589 --> 01:13:50.450]  This is what they do.
[01:13:51.533 --> 01:13:56.714]  So we need the clips of the stinkers saying it pronto, as fast as we can.
[01:13:56.714 --> 01:13:57.634]  Great job, crew.
[01:13:57.634 --> 01:13:59.795]  Owen, you went down there Thursday, Friday.
[01:13:59.795 --> 01:14:01.315]  You were there.
[01:14:01.315 --> 01:14:02.095]  I told you to come back.
[01:14:02.095 --> 01:14:03.995]  You couldn't even get into Houston.
[01:14:03.995 --> 01:14:05.516]  Zimmerman's down there because he has family there.
[01:14:05.516 --> 01:14:06.276]  He's got a kayak.
[01:14:06.276 --> 01:14:07.196]  He's in the middle of it.
[01:14:07.196 --> 01:14:11.237]  Powerful footage being uploaded as we speak to Infowars.com.
[01:14:11.237 --> 01:14:12.277]  First off, you were there.
[01:14:12.277 --> 01:14:13.737]  We'll get into that secondarily.
[01:14:13.737 --> 01:14:16.538]  What do you make of the incredible stand-down
[01:14:17.378 --> 01:14:22.819]  Because back on Thursday and Friday, I heard the mayor saying that stuff, but I wasn't trying to score political points.
[01:14:22.819 --> 01:14:24.419]  I was mainly worried about the state of Texas.
[01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:28.700]  We've got warehouses down there that are on high ground, so they didn't get flooded for some of the products.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.221]  But I was worried about family.
[01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:31.701]  That's our problem.
[01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:37.862]  As libertarians, as Americana, as patriots, we're not thinking about how to get an angle in an emergency.
[01:14:37.862 --> 01:14:39.603]  I almost am, like, blind.
[01:14:39.603 --> 01:14:45.904]  You know, and it's always later I go, what in the world are these people doing ordering a stand-down?
[01:14:46.084 --> 01:14:47.125]  Because they ordered a stand down.
[01:14:47.125 --> 01:14:49.646]  They said, we're not telling people they might want to go.
[01:14:49.646 --> 01:14:50.786]  That's nonsensical.
[01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:51.727]  Everything's fine.
[01:14:51.727 --> 01:14:52.607]  Stay in your houses.
[01:14:52.607 --> 01:14:54.508]  That's nonsensical, Abbott.
[01:14:54.508 --> 01:14:56.229]  I mean, what?
[01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:57.270]  Again, they won't get in trouble.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.701]  Because mainstream media will say they did a great job!
[01:15:00.701 --> 01:15:09.446]  Well, it'll be interesting to see how the mainstream media does respond if they're just going to put all the onus on Trump or they're going to look at the local leadership and say, hey, why didn't you do more?
[01:15:09.446 --> 01:15:12.288]  I think it was obvious, especially by Friday.
[01:15:12.288 --> 01:15:12.788]  Do more!
[01:15:12.788 --> 01:15:14.229]  They told people stay there!
[01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:20.152]  It was obvious by Friday to anyone with half a brain functioning that Houston was going to be rocked.
[01:15:20.612 --> 01:15:23.154]  I mean, that was, as you said, everybody knew it.
[01:15:23.154 --> 01:15:26.457]  All the major analysis was saying Houston was going to get flooded.
[01:15:26.457 --> 01:15:28.299]  That's where the majority of the rainfall was going to be.
[01:15:28.299 --> 01:15:30.240]  There's going to be some serious flooding.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:37.907]  So I don't know if the local leadership is, as you asked, that negligent intentionally or that ignorant.
[01:15:38.507 --> 01:15:39.247]  I'm not sure.
[01:15:39.247 --> 01:15:47.071]  If they think that they can have some sort of cover in the media by making statements like, oh it's nonsensical to want to evacuate or oh there's no need to evacuate.
[01:15:47.071 --> 01:15:52.374]  If they think they have cover in the media, well then of course they have no problem saying that if the media is just going to blame Trump.
[01:15:52.374 --> 01:16:03.280]  But if they're genuinely that ignorant, if they're genuinely that incompetent, Alex, and I think this is truly just a nationwide problem that is not being addressed as it should,
[01:16:04.577 --> 01:16:07.499]  I really think that that's how dumb these people are.
[01:16:07.499 --> 01:16:13.361]  I really think that that's how stupid and arrogant, not just people in local leadership, but all over.
[01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:16.703]  People in media, people in the general population.
[01:16:16.703 --> 01:16:18.724]  Just completely clueless, Alex.
[01:16:18.724 --> 01:16:20.205]  Just totally clueless.
[01:16:20.205 --> 01:16:21.745]  Totally unaware of anything.
[01:16:21.745 --> 01:16:27.268]  Totally head in the clouds until it hits them at home, and then it's like, wait a second, there's an actual world here?
[01:16:27.268 --> 01:16:29.809]  So you think it's a dodo bird scenario?
[01:16:29.809 --> 01:16:30.610]  I really do.
[01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:32.511]  I really, just only because
[01:16:33.484 --> 01:16:34.886]  The trend that we've been seeing.
[01:16:34.886 --> 01:16:36.547]  And Alex, this is something you and I have been talking about.
[01:16:36.547 --> 01:16:38.650]  Just the mental illness.
[01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:40.692]  It's like an epidemic.
[01:16:40.692 --> 01:16:43.135]  The complete ignorance is like an epidemic.
[01:16:43.135 --> 01:16:49.362]  I mean, yeah, we can go on the streets and show you how dumb these Antifa members are when you ask them why they're protesting.
[01:16:49.362 --> 01:16:51.164]  You can show how dumb these Trump supporters are.
[01:16:51.704 --> 01:16:55.749]  So then you have that story, literally Antifa getting away with being a domestic terrorist group.
[01:17:10.427 --> 01:17:16.769]  But I think just like you can walk up to Trump protesters, Antifa members, and ask them, hey, what's your cause?
[01:17:16.769 --> 01:17:18.190]  What are some of your ideas?
[01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:19.150]  Why are you out here?
[01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:20.191]  Screw you, Nazi!
[01:17:20.191 --> 01:17:27.453]  You could walk up probably to the local leadership in Houston and say they have a similar type conversation and they'd be just as ignorant.
[01:17:27.453 --> 01:17:29.314]  They'd be just as pathetic.
[01:17:29.314 --> 01:17:30.214]  I'm dead serious.
[01:17:30.214 --> 01:17:31.095]  I'm convinced of it now.
[01:17:31.915 --> 01:17:43.926]  Well, that's because when you buy into lie after lie after lie after lie, like Democrats defending Obamacare, when it was written bipartisanly to screw everybody, and the facts are all in that it doubles, triples prices, got rid of people being covered, they don't care.
[01:17:43.926 --> 01:17:48.370]  Because once you just don't care anymore and you just believe any lie, you become a delusional slob.
[01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:49.590]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:50.951]  And it's lazy, too.
[01:17:50.951 --> 01:17:55.832]  It's really easy for you to just hop onto the bandwagon and go along with what everyone else is saying.
[01:17:55.832 --> 01:17:58.873]  It's the groupthink that we expose so many times.
[01:17:58.873 --> 01:18:03.675]  But just to recap what I experienced, I've seen weather devastation.
[01:18:03.675 --> 01:18:04.315]  I was from St.
[01:18:04.315 --> 01:18:05.095]  Louis, Missouri.
[01:18:05.095 --> 01:18:05.895]  I've seen floods.
[01:18:05.895 --> 01:18:09.176]  There's flooding with the Mississippi, the Missouri River.
[01:18:09.176 --> 01:18:10.977]  You've seen a lot of tornadoes.
[01:18:12.017 --> 01:18:16.999]  The amazing thing about this to me, because I'd never seen a hurricane, was just the scale.
[01:18:16.999 --> 01:18:22.642]  I mean, we drove for hundreds of miles down the Texas coast, and it was like this everywhere we went, Alex.
[01:18:22.642 --> 01:18:27.264]  I mean, mobile homes flipped, cars crushed, houses just completely washed away.
[01:18:27.264 --> 01:18:31.686]  You saw the footage of Walmarts and Lowe's and gas stations just completely torn apart.
[01:18:31.686 --> 01:18:33.047]  Roofs torn off.
[01:18:33.047 --> 01:18:35.688]  And that was for just the hundreds of miles that we drove.
[01:18:35.688 --> 01:18:37.329]  So we drove up along the coastline.
[01:18:37.329 --> 01:18:40.491]  We started just, I guess, west of Corpus Christi.
[01:18:41.271 --> 01:18:42.431]  But to be worried about this is nonsensical.
[01:19:08.737 --> 01:19:10.258]  It's just, see, that's what I'm saying, Alex.
[01:19:10.258 --> 01:19:12.898]  There's no way... Look at Houston, if you're a TV viewer.
[01:19:12.898 --> 01:19:14.219]  It's under 27 feet of water.
[01:19:14.219 --> 01:19:17.260]  It's nonsensical to tell people to evacuate.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:19.441]  I really think that that's how dumb they are.
[01:19:19.441 --> 01:19:26.543]  And either way, even if you have... But why are Democrats, because Republicans have got their problems, why are they so stupid?
[01:19:26.543 --> 01:19:30.845]  From Pelosi on down, they are literally like, they've been given lobotomies, man.
[01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:33.954]  Just like the general public, Alex.
[01:19:33.954 --> 01:19:35.276]  It's just like the general public.
[01:19:35.276 --> 01:19:35.736]  They have been.
[01:19:35.736 --> 01:19:38.259]  They've been sipping on fluoride water right out of the womb.
[01:19:38.259 --> 01:19:42.864]  They got shot up with the same vaccines that are making, you know, half these people with... They're in a trance.
[01:19:42.864 --> 01:19:43.925]  They're TV heads.
[01:19:43.925 --> 01:19:45.727]  I've noticed it with TV heads.
[01:19:45.727 --> 01:19:51.413]  They just watch TV all day, passive television, and their brains have been eaten.
[01:19:51.413 --> 01:19:52.194]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:52.194 --> 01:19:52.595]  Stay with us.
[01:19:54.625 --> 01:19:57.186]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[01:19:57.186 --> 01:19:59.347]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[01:19:59.347 --> 01:20:01.308]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:02.280]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.261]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.

[01:23:56.207 --> 01:24:08.182]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:24:23.428 --> 01:24:26.211]  Alright, Owen Schroyer is my guest riding shotgun with me this hour.
[01:24:26.211 --> 01:24:28.853]  We're going to open the phones up for folks that are in Texas, Louisiana.
[01:24:28.853 --> 01:24:32.316]  I want to give your response to what's happening with Hurricane Harvey.
[01:24:32.316 --> 01:24:33.738]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:24:33.738 --> 01:24:33.798]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:33.798 --> 01:24:37.081]  More and more I'm going to segway away from that number I've had for 19 years to our own number.
[01:24:45.268 --> 01:24:50.072]  Here in house just so we can be able to take more calls and have it all here in Austin, Texas.
[01:24:50.072 --> 01:24:56.018]  I still work some with GCN up in Minnesota and still route the calls through there.
[01:24:56.018 --> 01:25:02.083]  We did find a clip of the mayor in the aftermath explaining why they didn't issue
[01:25:03.424 --> 01:25:03.765]  I don't
[01:25:18.186 --> 01:25:18.406]  So just die?
[01:25:41.491 --> 01:25:45.513]  They came out and said Friday afternoon, it's too late, you don't evacuate.
[01:25:45.513 --> 01:25:50.776]  Why didn't they listen to the governor and the Texas National Guard and the Oceanic Administration?
[01:25:50.776 --> 01:25:54.237]  Why didn't they use their common sense if the mother of all hurricanes is coming?
[01:25:54.237 --> 01:25:56.919]  You need to tell folks that they need to evacuate.
[01:25:56.919 --> 01:25:56.979]  Or...
[01:25:58.041 --> 01:26:02.104]  Is he being honest that a mega city of 10 million people just isn't tenable?
[01:26:02.104 --> 01:26:03.365]  These are death traps.
[01:26:03.365 --> 01:26:04.766]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[01:26:04.766 --> 01:26:10.711]  Perhaps they're showing some of their true ideologies here as far as how they approach the concept of a big city.
[01:26:10.711 --> 01:26:12.653]  Because he's kind of right.
[01:26:12.653 --> 01:26:17.717]  I mean, if there was something that went down in Austin and you try to cross one of the three bridges to get out of the city...
[01:26:18.476 --> 01:26:19.877]  You ain't going nowhere, folks.
[01:26:19.877 --> 01:26:21.537]  You're stuck in Austin.
[01:26:21.537 --> 01:26:25.318]  And maybe that's what he's alluding to, saying, hey, I didn't want to cause a chaos.
[01:26:25.318 --> 01:26:28.820]  I didn't want to cause crisis by telling people that you live in a big city.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.600]  If you try to evacuate, you're pretty much screwed.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.141]  So you might as well just hunker down and hope you don't die.
[01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:37.343]  Maybe that's just them showing their ideology of how to approach these big cities.
[01:26:37.343 --> 01:26:41.804]  I mean, we've talked about the plan to make mega cities.
[01:26:41.804 --> 01:26:44.205]  I forget the exact government document.
[01:26:44.205 --> 01:26:44.926]  Agenda 21.
[01:26:46.286 --> 01:26:46.767]  We're good to go.
[01:27:01.203 --> 01:27:03.464]  The same thing that the Mayor Khan says.
[01:27:03.464 --> 01:27:06.685]  He says, oh, terrorism is just part and parcel to living in a big city.
[01:27:06.685 --> 01:27:08.065]  So that's what they're going to say next.
[01:27:08.065 --> 01:27:11.046]  Dying in a hurricane is just part and parcel to living in a big city.
[01:27:11.046 --> 01:27:12.507]  There's no solution to these issues.
[01:27:12.507 --> 01:27:14.068]  See, you're in a big city.
[01:27:14.068 --> 01:27:15.548]  You're on the control grid.
[01:27:15.548 --> 01:27:16.548]  There's nothing you can do.
[01:27:16.548 --> 01:27:17.989]  That's just big city life.
[01:27:17.989 --> 01:27:19.069]  You just got to live with it.
[01:27:19.069 --> 01:27:23.751]  And we're not going to tell you to evacuate, even though we know that the elites have their helicopters that they can evacuate on.
[01:27:23.831 --> 01:27:25.053]  Yeah, they'll just fly right out of there.
[01:27:25.053 --> 01:27:25.553]  They don't mind.
[01:27:25.553 --> 01:27:27.035]  They were probably out days before.
[01:27:27.035 --> 01:27:30.199]  So everything is this mindset of we're the little people.
[01:27:30.199 --> 01:27:30.459]  Yeah.
[01:27:30.459 --> 01:27:31.921]  They're the gods up on Mount Olympus.
[01:27:31.921 --> 01:27:34.825]  Let's play a clip of the mayor.
[01:27:34.825 --> 01:27:40.912]  This is, again, the mayor of Houston, Texas, Sylvester Turner.
[01:27:40.912 --> 01:27:41.273]  Here it is.
[01:27:42.267 --> 01:27:48.212]  Quite frankly, every neighborhood, every community received water and flooding.
[01:27:48.212 --> 01:27:50.995]  Every bayou went over its banks.
[01:27:50.995 --> 01:27:56.579]  You cannot put, in the city of Houston, 2.3 million people on the road.
[01:27:56.579 --> 01:27:58.021]  That is dangerous.
[01:27:58.021 --> 01:28:03.165]  For Houston-Harris County, Harris County got a lot of rain, a lot of flooding.
[01:28:03.165 --> 01:28:05.167]  When you combine Houston and Harris County,
[01:28:05.635 --> 01:28:11.096]  You literally cannot put 6.5 million people on the road.
[01:28:11.096 --> 01:28:18.398]  If you think the situation right now is bad, you give an order to evacuate, you are creating a nightmare.
[01:28:18.398 --> 01:28:20.978]  Especially when it's not planned.
[01:28:20.978 --> 01:28:25.519]  And many of us in this city remember when the evacuation order was ordered before.
[01:28:25.519 --> 01:28:27.320]  And we learned our lesson from that.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.000]  It has to be very well coordinated.
[01:28:29.984 --> 01:28:33.487]  All the way from Houston to the destination point.
[01:28:33.487 --> 01:28:35.829]  You have to make sure that you have proper gas stations.
[01:28:35.829 --> 01:28:41.173]  You have to make sure that you have the proper lanes that are flowing in the right direction.
[01:28:41.173 --> 01:28:43.095]  It has to be coordinated.
[01:28:43.095 --> 01:28:46.017]  If you do it, or attempt to do it, and it's not coordinated,
[01:28:46.537 --> 01:28:47.759]  Not done right.
[01:28:47.759 --> 01:28:50.181]  You are literally putting people... Oh, that's enough.
[01:28:50.181 --> 01:28:53.064]  So that's like saying we have the Titanic is sinking.
[01:28:53.064 --> 01:28:57.008]  We're not going to try to evacuate anybody because, you know, there's too many people.
[01:28:57.008 --> 01:29:01.113]  Well, yeah, they didn't do the drills on the Titanic like they were supposed to.
[01:29:01.113 --> 01:29:06.979]  And since they've had evacuation problems before now, since it didn't go well last time, we're just not going to do it.
[01:29:07.319 --> 01:29:10.901]  No, you say, a week before, when they knew it was probably going to hit.
[01:29:10.901 --> 01:29:21.246]  You might want to think about, those of you that can, going to visit family in a couple days, and then maybe you get a government program going where everybody has a different color for when you're going to evacuate, you know, try to coordinate it.
[01:29:21.246 --> 01:29:25.089]  But this is a load of bull saying, well, it's too complex, let's just give up.
[01:29:25.089 --> 01:29:32.993]  That's why the trains are all wrecking, the infrastructure is falling apart, because the Democrat attitude of things is, we don't know how any of this works, so we're not going to try.
[01:29:33.573 --> 01:29:35.554]  Seriously, this is insane.
[01:29:35.554 --> 01:29:36.454]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:36.454 --> 01:29:38.615]  We'll get Owen Schroer's take on this and more.
[01:29:38.615 --> 01:29:39.015]  Stay with us.
[01:29:39.015 --> 01:29:43.717]  Your phone calls.
[01:29:43.717 --> 01:29:45.118]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.118 --> 01:29:47.639]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.639 --> 01:29:50.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.512 --> 01:30:07.337]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[01:30:07.337 --> 01:30:09.879]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[01:30:09.879 --> 01:30:13.342]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[01:30:13.342 --> 01:30:15.543]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:20.367]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[01:30:20.367 --> 01:30:23.229]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:27.452]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[01:30:30.334 --> 01:30:31.255]  Unprecedented.
[01:30:31.255 --> 01:30:32.476]  And it's cold-pressed.
[01:30:32.476 --> 01:30:34.418]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[01:30:34.418 --> 01:30:38.803]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are other what you sell.
[01:30:38.803 --> 01:30:40.765]  BuzzFeed said it's like it's already best-selling stuff.
[01:30:40.765 --> 01:30:42.827]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[01:30:42.827 --> 01:30:44.028]  Why these aren't anything new?
[01:30:44.028 --> 01:30:48.092]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best but cold-pressed?
[01:30:48.092 --> 01:30:48.293]  Dude.
[01:30:48.293 --> 01:30:48.673]  Dude.

[01:32:15.896 --> 01:32:19.076]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:32:19.076 --> 01:32:22.957]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:32:22.957 --> 01:32:30.119]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.

[01:33:12.672 --> 01:33:13.833]  Big Brother.
[01:33:13.833 --> 01:33:15.614]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:15.614 --> 01:33:17.536]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:17.536 --> 01:33:19.197]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:19.197 --> 01:33:20.858]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:20.858 --> 01:33:23.580]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:30.965]  Take me through the centuries to supersonic years.
[01:33:30.965 --> 01:33:34.428]  Electrified
[01:33:43.812 --> 01:33:46.174]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:33:46.174 --> 01:33:49.317]  Coming up, we're going to look at geopolitical developments in Afghanistan and more.
[01:33:49.317 --> 01:34:02.527]  And then go to your phone calls with the devastating super hurricane that's dumped 50-plus inches, 20-plus feet of water in many areas of Houston, the bizarre responses of the government and more.
[01:34:02.527 --> 01:34:03.408]  That's all coming up.
[01:34:04.295 --> 01:34:07.016]  Look at this headline from Infowars.com.
[01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:12.598]  Houston officials downplayed flood warnings as fake news.
[01:34:12.598 --> 01:34:13.578]  Dan Lyman's story.
[01:34:13.578 --> 01:34:19.600]  City faces potential lawsuit for publicly shaming resident who blew the whistle.
[01:34:20.746 --> 01:34:25.570]  Sure, they've had trouble with evacuations before doing it a day before, so you do it two days before.
[01:34:25.570 --> 01:34:33.998]  They knew from NOAA that this was going to be a megastorm, probably the worst ever from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[01:34:33.998 --> 01:34:35.219]  That's why they have the signs.
[01:34:35.219 --> 01:34:38.882]  That's why they have the highways set up for it.
[01:34:38.882 --> 01:34:41.384]  That's why they have the evacuation zones.
[01:34:41.384 --> 01:34:46.389]  And yes, a big megacity with six plus million in two counties, total metro ten million.
[01:34:46.969 --> 01:34:49.290]  It's hard to get all those people out.
[01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:51.031]  A lot of folks are going to stay regardless.
[01:34:51.031 --> 01:34:54.333]  But why didn't they even try this time?
[01:34:54.333 --> 01:34:57.574]  And now, like you said during the break, they're just passing the buck.
[01:34:57.574 --> 01:35:00.816]  It's like the guy waving his arms around Team America.
[01:35:00.816 --> 01:35:02.556]  Yeah, it's like, who's in charge here?
[01:35:02.556 --> 01:35:08.259]  This guy comes out and he says, well, we couldn't call for an evacuation because that was going to cause an emergency.
[01:35:08.259 --> 01:35:09.920]  Well, you're in an emergency.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.140]  That's the whole point.
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:14.002]  And whose job is it to prepare for that?
[01:35:14.502 --> 01:35:15.642]  Wouldn't that be your job?
[01:35:15.642 --> 01:35:17.263]  So it's like you said, they're throwing up their hands.
[01:35:17.263 --> 01:35:18.443]  Well, who's in charge here?
[01:35:18.443 --> 01:35:19.784]  Well, I'll take hold now.
[01:35:19.784 --> 01:35:24.445]  I'll be in charge now that everything's bad and I'll make a statement now and everything's fine.
[01:35:24.445 --> 01:35:26.685]  There's too many people in the city to evacuate.
[01:35:26.685 --> 01:35:31.727]  If you live in a big city, just expect to die from a terror attack or a hurricane or a flood and just shut up.
[01:35:31.727 --> 01:35:33.567]  That's just what you get from living in a big city.
[01:35:33.567 --> 01:35:35.728]  But that's an amazing story from Dan Lyman.
[01:35:35.728 --> 01:35:37.829]  It goes beyond just saying discounted.
[01:35:37.829 --> 01:35:42.670]  It turns out the city council knew three days before and decided not to tell people.
[01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:45.412]  And then mocking citizens who are trying to warn them?
[01:35:45.412 --> 01:35:47.134]  And then mocking the governor?
[01:35:47.134 --> 01:35:48.315]  That's unheard of.
[01:35:48.315 --> 01:35:50.697]  How about don't live in a place like Houston?
[01:35:50.697 --> 01:35:55.361]  It's really sad too, especially if they try to play the whole, oh my gosh, Harvey's racist.
[01:35:55.361 --> 01:35:57.082]  You know who else is an expert on this?
[01:35:57.082 --> 01:35:59.404]  Joel Skelton will get his take on this in a moment.
[01:35:59.404 --> 01:36:02.507]  He's written Strategic Relocation, the Bible of this stuff.
[01:36:03.248 --> 01:36:08.053]  He's written, you know, The Safe Home, The Secure Home, and of course we've put out a film with him.
[01:36:08.053 --> 01:36:10.015]  You can sell the book at infowarestore.com.
[01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:15.962]  But before we go to him on that, let me just remind listeners and viewers, you need to read Strategically Relocation.
[01:36:15.962 --> 01:36:17.624]  You need to get the accompanying film.
[01:36:18.465 --> 01:36:25.094]  You need to support the broadcast because this is all symbiotic information that helps you as well, but also funds our operation.
[01:36:25.094 --> 01:36:33.905]  They're coming after us, the globalists, Google, the Southern Poverty Law Center is trying to set it up where we can't even do business on major shopping cart or banking platforms.
[01:36:33.905 --> 01:36:35.087]  That's why the
[01:36:35.908 --> 01:36:38.129]  Kennedy Center's filed suit.
[01:36:38.129 --> 01:36:41.170]  Major Christian organizations are also filing suit.
[01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:44.471]  I'm going to get some into that because they're blocking us from commerce.
[01:36:44.471 --> 01:36:45.932]  Talk about true mark of the beast.
[01:36:45.932 --> 01:36:47.092]  This is incredible.
[01:36:47.092 --> 01:36:50.013]  So please, you're our lifeline to fund our operation.
[01:36:50.013 --> 01:36:54.175]  Get Strategic Relocation DVD and book special together or individually.
[01:36:55.356 --> 01:36:55.796]  I don't know.
[01:37:14.486 --> 01:37:15.427]  Sometimes we run out of it.
[01:37:15.427 --> 01:37:18.069]  It looks like it's going to be months until we get more.
[01:37:18.069 --> 01:37:19.990]  It is 57% off.
[01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:22.252]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:37:24.994 --> 01:37:27.215]  We also have the Bio True Selenium.
[01:37:27.215 --> 01:37:29.077]  That's just organic mustard seed.
[01:37:29.077 --> 01:37:29.737]  Selenium.
[01:37:29.737 --> 01:37:31.218]  Super strong.
[01:37:31.218 --> 01:37:33.060]  A lot of the stuff is synthetic out there.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:33.660]  It's just garbage.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:34.421]  It does nothing for you.
[01:37:35.001 --> 01:37:35.382]  We're good
[01:37:54.361 --> 01:37:57.543]  Bromine, the bromide, the chlorine, the fluoride, it goes in.
[01:37:57.543 --> 01:38:00.645]  So find out why it's changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[01:38:00.645 --> 01:38:02.146]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:38:02.146 --> 01:38:02.967]  Massive reviews.
[01:38:02.967 --> 01:38:04.768]  Thousands and thousands of reviews.

[01:38:48.217 --> 01:38:48.798]  But you notice,
[01:38:50.162 --> 01:38:58.609]  They've got a new show on Comedy Central launching five days a week that poses as news where the person plays the part of myself and says horrible racist things.
[01:38:58.609 --> 01:39:02.172]  Then they say in the news that I said that, that people physically attacked me on the street.
[01:39:02.172 --> 01:39:03.653]  This is mass mental illness.
[01:39:03.653 --> 01:39:05.575]  Beyond suspended disbelief, it's mind control.
[01:39:06.806 --> 01:39:09.127]  Jordan Kepler five nights a week attacking me.
[01:39:09.127 --> 01:39:11.927]  Two shows on HBO attacking me.
[01:39:11.927 --> 01:39:13.368]  Showtime.
[01:39:13.368 --> 01:39:19.169]  Every major TV network just savagely, Alex Jones is the most racist man in America.
[01:39:19.169 --> 01:39:21.029]  Though they have no clips.
[01:39:21.029 --> 01:39:22.350]  Tom Brokaw saying it.
[01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:27.111]  And that's why I'm in consultation with the lawyers and I'm sending letters out to Tom Brokaw, all of them,
[01:39:28.243 --> 01:39:31.906]  I don't want to do this, but they're removing me from commerce now.
[01:39:31.906 --> 01:39:46.198]  When they start not letting you even do business, or be on Amazon, or they don't let the D. Kennedy Center, major mainline Christian organization, even operate the D. James Kennedy Center.
[01:39:46.198 --> 01:39:51.363]  We also have other major organizations this is happening to, who can't even operate.
[01:39:51.363 --> 01:39:55.766]  Folks that have been shot up, and the people said they came because the SPLC, and of course
[01:39:56.696 --> 01:39:59.479]  It just gets worse and worse and worse from there.
[01:39:59.479 --> 01:40:07.666]  So, the Family Research Council is getting involved in lawsuits, and I've been saying this is one of our non-violent ways to deal with this.
[01:40:07.666 --> 01:40:09.327]  This is serious racketeering.
[01:40:09.327 --> 01:40:12.010]  This is serious civil rights violations.
[01:40:12.010 --> 01:40:15.232]  And the Supreme Court's clear, the lawyers are clear.
[01:40:15.232 --> 01:40:20.237]  I've talked to some of the top lawyers in the country, and they said, Alex, it's open and shut what they've done to you.
[01:40:20.237 --> 01:40:20.717]  But Alex,
[01:40:21.718 --> 01:40:25.280]  Look at these hundreds of other groups that are even more mainline.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.623]  Do you want to do this yourself or wait till they bring them down?
[01:40:28.623 --> 01:40:39.730]  It was the same thing with Righthaven, who was suing people for all sorts of stuff, and I'm not going to get into the private settlement, but my lawyer said, look, your case is good, but just wait.
[01:40:39.730 --> 01:40:41.751]  They're going to get brought down by other folks, and they did.
[01:40:41.751 --> 01:40:42.432]  They got brought down.
[01:40:43.424 --> 01:40:47.767]  But with this, I just morally can't sit here and wait while this is happening.
[01:40:47.767 --> 01:40:50.689]  So we're going to cover the waterfront with yourself and Joel Skousen.
[01:40:50.689 --> 01:40:52.971]  I want to get into the turn that Trump's making.
[01:40:52.971 --> 01:40:56.013]  I want to get into the evacuation we're seeing.
[01:40:56.013 --> 01:40:59.115]  And I want to get into the censorship is now here.
[01:40:59.115 --> 01:41:00.356]  It's now intense.
[01:41:00.356 --> 01:41:01.497]  The attack is now here.
[01:41:01.497 --> 01:41:05.780]  They're openly saying they're getting ready to kill Trump, where we think all this is going.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:07.741]  So Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:41:09.022 --> 01:41:13.264]  One of the smartest guys out there on geopolitics, but also on natural disasters.
[01:41:13.264 --> 01:41:17.125]  Which of these three big areas you want to tackle first?
[01:41:17.125 --> 01:41:19.786]  Well, let's cover the Harvey situation first.
[01:41:19.786 --> 01:41:33.691]  You know, as I've warned in my book, Strategic Relocation, being in high-density population area is a death trap in any kind of major emergency where people have to leave or be rescued because there simply aren't enough resources.
[01:41:33.691 --> 01:41:35.212]  I mean, to a certain extent, I'm
[01:41:36.784 --> 01:41:43.030]  You know, a little bit taken back by the mayor's position.
[01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:46.933]  Clearly, it's impossible to evacuate six million, but you don't have to evacuate six million.
[01:41:46.933 --> 01:41:53.319]  There's really only about 500,000 people in affected areas that are actually underwater.
[01:41:53.319 --> 01:41:53.859]  Exactly!
[01:41:53.859 --> 01:41:55.761]  If you're in a floodplain, evacuate!
[01:41:57.529 --> 01:42:02.997]  I mean, any sane person should know, whether you read my book or not, this is not a good place to be living.
[01:42:02.997 --> 01:42:13.852]  If you're in New Orleans and those things, and you, and unfortunately a lot of these people are low-income people who are totally dependent on government instructions and welfare and don't move until the government tells them to move.
[01:42:14.392 --> 01:42:16.554]  But the government's pretty incompetent in this.
[01:42:16.554 --> 01:42:23.542]  Even if they had the resources, which they don't, we don't have any preparations to relocate even 500,000 people, let alone a million.
[01:42:23.542 --> 01:42:36.295]  Joel, I've been asking the question, it's now confirmed, it's on Infowars.com, it's mainstream news, it's broke, that city council members knew it was going to flood three days before, and the decision was made to not tell the people, lest it create a panic.
[01:42:36.955 --> 01:42:42.238]  It's like you said, tell the people in the flood area evacuate, tell other folks they shouldn't, problem solved.
[01:42:42.238 --> 01:42:45.300]  Why in the hell, excuse me, why would they do something like that?
[01:42:47.216 --> 01:42:54.877]  Well, there's a groupthink mentality here about liability, that if we tell them and they panic, then we're liable for that.
[01:42:54.877 --> 01:42:57.958]  I mean, the lawyers have just created panic within these city councils.
[01:42:57.958 --> 01:43:01.739]  They're sitting right on their shoulder, telling them what they can and cannot say.
[01:43:01.739 --> 01:43:04.579]  But, you know, frankly, I don't blame this on the city council.
[01:43:04.579 --> 01:43:07.219]  Every one of these people have televisions, multiple televisions.
[01:43:07.219 --> 01:43:08.500]  They're watching the news.
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:13.841]  They've seen the same predictions I've seen, that in two more days, there's more inches coming and more inches after that.
[01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:16.061]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know.
[01:43:16.201 --> 01:43:17.222]  That's what Owen was saying.
[01:43:17.222 --> 01:43:19.684]  It's like the zombiosis is getting worse.
[01:43:19.684 --> 01:43:22.607]  I know you observed this, Joel Skousen.
[01:43:22.607 --> 01:43:24.068]  What do you think is happening to people?
[01:43:24.068 --> 01:43:25.289]  They've been admitting studies.
[01:43:25.289 --> 01:43:27.431]  Brainwaves on average are lowering.
[01:43:27.431 --> 01:43:29.573]  People are in a near sleep-like trance.
[01:43:29.573 --> 01:43:31.395]  A mass daydream.
[01:43:31.395 --> 01:43:33.337]  A spell has come upon the land.
[01:43:33.337 --> 01:43:34.538]  It's like the Bible talks about.
[01:43:35.774 --> 01:43:40.475]  And part of that is because of this government's going to take care of us mentality.
[01:43:40.475 --> 01:43:44.277]  I mean, especially the people on welfare, they're getting everything they have from the government.
[01:43:44.277 --> 01:43:48.818]  They are relying on government and people need to see the consequences of this.
[01:43:48.818 --> 01:43:53.959]  People need to be hurt in order to realize I've got to act on my own.
[01:43:53.959 --> 01:43:56.940]  I've got to personally prepare for these kinds of emergencies.
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:58.721]  And people don't have that mentality.
[01:43:58.721 --> 01:44:01.922]  The more the government takes over their self responsibility.
[01:44:02.742 --> 01:44:07.867]  So that's really it, is we've become totally domesticated, like the movie WALL-E.
[01:44:07.867 --> 01:44:09.448]  Soon we won't be able to walk.
[01:44:09.448 --> 01:44:12.651]  How far can this unbalance go though, Joel?
[01:44:12.651 --> 01:44:17.956]  It seems like nature abhors a vacuum and this just reeks of societal collapse to me.
[01:44:19.028 --> 01:44:23.071]  Yeah, nature will provide the very dangerous lessons.
[01:44:23.071 --> 01:44:30.476]  We're going to see people die, we're going to see people lose everything in this flooding, and they'll have very little to blame but themselves.
[01:44:30.476 --> 01:44:34.659]  Whether or not the whole nation takes notice, I'm not sure.
[01:44:34.659 --> 01:44:38.682]  You know, people tend to look at their television and say, oh, that's too bad what's happening in Houston.
[01:44:38.682 --> 01:44:48.449]  But someday, and that's what I warn about in strategic relocation, you know, we're going to face a nuclear war in this nation with Russia and China, and people literally
[01:44:49.227 --> 01:44:54.212]  Even though they see it talked about in the press, feel total confidence the government knows what they're doing.
[01:44:54.212 --> 01:44:55.893]  They're not going to let this happen to us.
[01:44:55.893 --> 01:44:57.395]  We've never been attacked.
[01:44:57.395 --> 01:44:58.536]  And it's someday going to happen.
[01:44:58.536 --> 01:45:08.325]  People will not be as prepared at all unless they... I want to get into the geopolitical with you, because you're really the expert on, but the full-out assault
[01:45:09.345 --> 01:45:20.353]  Hundreds of Christian groups, mainline groups, being banned from Amazon, being banned from national charity groups, being banned from quote public indexes.
[01:45:20.353 --> 01:45:27.859]  This is hardcore persecution of the church starting here and a lot of the church is just groveling
[01:45:28.499 --> 01:45:33.180]  You know, to the SPLC even more, you know, hoping that they don't get put on the list.
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:36.481]  This is like, first they came for this group, I did nothing, then they came for that group.
[01:45:36.481 --> 01:45:37.721]  What do you make of this?
[01:45:37.721 --> 01:45:42.502]  And I really think I am forced to start litigating because I've been included in this as well.
[01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:50.904]  And again, whether they want to call me these names or not, to then use the database to go out and block me from commerce, next I'm not going to be able to have a bank account.
[01:45:50.904 --> 01:45:53.505]  I mean, we're being refused from credit card services now.
[01:45:55.376 --> 01:45:57.097]  Yeah, and it's going to get worse.
[01:45:57.097 --> 01:46:03.660]  What I fear, though, Alex, is the courts having a strong leftist bent and a lot of them being part of the deep state.
[01:46:05.834 --> 01:46:06.515]  I'm not sure.
[01:46:06.515 --> 01:46:08.516]  You know, they can look at the law both ways.
[01:46:08.516 --> 01:46:12.639]  They can, for example, justify Google and Amazon by saying, well, these are private companies.
[01:46:12.639 --> 01:46:15.601]  You don't have a right to advertise on these.
[01:46:15.601 --> 01:46:16.742]  This is not free speech.
[01:46:16.742 --> 01:46:18.683]  This is not government.
[01:46:18.683 --> 01:46:25.608]  And yet, if this was a private company doing racial discrimination, the courts would rule in their favor.
[01:46:26.306 --> 01:46:29.227]  And so this is a very biased judicial system here.
[01:46:29.227 --> 01:46:34.889]  And I think your lawyers, you know, is wise in saying, look, these other guys have a good case.
[01:46:34.889 --> 01:46:36.829]  Let them work this out through the courts.
[01:46:36.829 --> 01:46:41.771]  They'll try to milk you dry financially through litigation if you're not careful.
[01:46:41.771 --> 01:46:46.512]  So but I you know, I think the case is is good.
[01:46:47.268 --> 01:46:51.090]  And strong, but the judges and systems will not back us up, I'm afraid.
[01:46:51.090 --> 01:46:57.693]  Sure, and there's also just the defamation level of Tom Brokaw saying, Alex Jones is a complete and total racist, close quote.
[01:46:57.693 --> 01:46:59.714]  We must have courage and stop him.
[01:46:59.714 --> 01:47:02.015]  Then there's a call to action to destroy me.
[01:47:02.015 --> 01:47:06.337]  That's the very definition of conscious defamation.
[01:47:06.337 --> 01:47:07.198]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:47:07.198 --> 01:47:09.319]  You ought to go after him with a ten-foot pole.
[01:47:10.695 --> 01:47:15.377]  Legally, he's guilty of defamation.
[01:47:15.377 --> 01:47:16.618]  They would never act like this before.
[01:47:16.618 --> 01:47:19.379]  Why are they so desperate to do this?
[01:47:19.379 --> 01:47:21.420]  It's because you're being effective, Alex.
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:25.802]  I mean, there's a rebellion going on and Trump got it really going and it's...
[01:47:27.293 --> 01:47:34.336]  You know, the more they attack Trump, the more the Trump support base rises up and sees the injustice of this.
[01:47:34.336 --> 01:47:40.898]  And we're seeing it right now with the dismissal of Sebastian Gorka and Steve Bannon.
[01:47:40.898 --> 01:47:42.079]  They're purging the White House.
[01:47:42.079 --> 01:47:47.781]  They've got a wall of information that John Kelly has put around the president, not allowing anybody.
[01:47:47.781 --> 01:47:50.402]  He's taken away the cell phone from the president.
[01:47:51.002 --> 01:47:54.625]  So that the President's given out a cell phone number to other people and they can't reach him now.
[01:47:54.625 --> 01:47:56.807]  They've got to go through John Kelly.
[01:47:56.807 --> 01:48:00.329]  It's a complete total filter now of who gets to the President.
[01:48:00.329 --> 01:48:04.593]  And I've now confirmed that Gorka and Bannon did not get fired.
[01:48:04.593 --> 01:48:08.556]  They left in disgust by the Afghanistan decision.
[01:48:08.556 --> 01:48:13.499]  But behind the scenes, Trump is chewing out Tillerson, saying you're too establishment.
[01:48:13.499 --> 01:48:18.683]  He is going after some of the other people, telling the Goldman Sachs guy, you know, you're a globalist.
[01:48:18.683 --> 01:48:20.325]  I hired you to get the economy going.
[01:48:20.845 --> 01:48:24.148]  Because you're supposedly the best, and then they're all out bad-mouthing him.
[01:48:24.148 --> 01:48:26.110]  We'll play this in the next segment.
[01:48:26.110 --> 01:48:31.074]  Whether it's Cohen or whether it's Tillerson, they're openly making snide comments against the president.
[01:48:31.074 --> 01:48:34.277]  He is totally surrounded.
[01:48:34.277 --> 01:48:37.120]  Well, he is surrounded, but Trump's a tough guy.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:41.364]  Trump could stop this, although he doesn't know how to do it now.
[01:48:41.364 --> 01:48:42.545]  You know, he's under siege.
[01:48:43.217 --> 01:48:53.401]  And he's scared, he's running scared, and these people are claiming, we know how to handle this, we can save you, but you've got to get rid of the radicals in your administration.
[01:48:53.401 --> 01:49:00.323]  I disagree that Bannon left, he left voluntarily, and Gorka did too, after they were fired.
[01:49:01.104 --> 01:49:19.313]  But they were fired, and in the World Affairs Brief this last Friday, I went through why Gorka was fired, the three things that he did that offended Trump by taking credit for the election, by several other statements, I mean contradicting Trump about Afghanistan or about a war in North Korea.
[01:49:19.313 --> 01:49:26.777]  Sure, well I was going with what Bannon and what Gorka said, saying we resigned, we weren't fired, and I guess the word was the firing was coming?
[01:49:26.777 --> 01:49:29.959]  Yeah, it was absolutely coming, but you've got to remember that Gorka
[01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:32.210]  Was completely isolated.
[01:49:32.210 --> 01:49:34.071]  He literally couldn't talk to anybody.
[01:49:34.071 --> 01:49:37.033]  They wouldn't even give him a national security clearance.
[01:49:37.033 --> 01:49:37.413]  That's right.
[01:49:37.413 --> 01:49:38.373]  They wouldn't give him a clearance.
[01:49:38.373 --> 01:49:39.614]  So what is he going to do?
[01:49:39.614 --> 01:49:43.256]  He's going to say, I'm going to be more effective going back to Breitbart on the news.
[01:49:43.256 --> 01:49:44.277]  And he's right.
[01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:45.738]  I mean, you're totally isolated.
[01:49:45.738 --> 01:49:48.859]  And while there's a wall around Trump, you can't talk to him anymore.
[01:49:48.859 --> 01:49:51.381]  What good are you sitting there collecting a salary?
[01:49:53.342 --> 01:49:54.144]  Let's be honest.
[01:49:54.144 --> 01:49:57.069]  I know we're always honest, but let's not lie to ourselves.
[01:49:57.069 --> 01:50:04.363]  Trump, in seven months and a week, killed TPP, killed the carbon tax, killed political correctness, controlled the border somewhat.
[01:50:05.598 --> 01:50:08.040]  Go help get the stock market going.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:12.204]  Got thousands of companies, hundreds of big ones that say they're coming back.
[01:50:12.204 --> 01:50:14.906]  But the elite is totally against him.
[01:50:14.906 --> 01:50:16.647]  They've bullied even his own family.
[01:50:16.647 --> 01:50:22.232]  Only the sons have stuck with him from the intel I've got, and his wife somewhat.
[01:50:22.232 --> 01:50:23.533]  And they're death-threatening him.
[01:50:23.533 --> 01:50:25.715]  They're attacking all his businesses.
[01:50:25.715 --> 01:50:28.898]  They can't walk on the street anymore, any of his family.
[01:50:28.898 --> 01:50:29.719]  I mean, let's talk about...
[01:50:30.319 --> 01:50:31.080]  I've been demonized.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.581]  I've gotten to enjoy their hate.
[01:50:32.581 --> 01:50:35.363]  But let me tell you, with the Trumps, it's next level.
[01:50:35.363 --> 01:50:55.277]  But then he did this Afghanistan thing because they really sold him that they can go in, dominate them, beat them, actually take out the bad guys, untie the military's hands, because Obama was always directing things, and that they can, then in a year, this is what I was told by high-level folks, then they can argue a peace deal, bring in some business, have Afghanistan stand down, use Pakistan as pressure on India.
[01:50:56.178 --> 01:50:59.301]  But I just don't see that working because there is no country in Afghanistan.
[01:50:59.301 --> 01:51:03.064]  It's 30 plus tribes, hundreds of subgroups, always killing each other.
[01:51:03.064 --> 01:51:05.326]  You can't conquer something that doesn't exist.
[01:51:05.326 --> 01:51:07.188]  I mean, it's like a Stone Age group in my view.
[01:51:07.188 --> 01:51:12.513]  You're a real geopolitical expert and former military officer in your own right and an expert on this.
[01:51:12.513 --> 01:51:19.680]  But I got to say, when he agreed to that first health care repeal that was a bad deal, that really hit him with people because it was bad.
[01:51:20.521 --> 01:51:22.802]  He's backed off on some of the vaccine stuff.
[01:51:22.802 --> 01:51:25.623]  He's backed off some of the Federal Reserve stuff.
[01:51:25.623 --> 01:51:30.024]  And now, on this Afghanistan thing, he said, I went against my instincts.
[01:51:30.024 --> 01:51:35.646]  So, again, thank God, as Rand Paul said every morning, we don't have Hillary, and we'd already probably be in World War III.
[01:51:35.646 --> 01:51:36.426]  I know he's real.
[01:51:36.426 --> 01:51:37.707]  I know he's surrounded.
[01:51:37.707 --> 01:51:44.149]  I've got 70-something crew members, and they're great, but I can't run stuff right half the time, trying to be a competent person.
[01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:46.990]  So, being in his shoes, I can't imagine
[01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:53.413]  But it does appear he's like a boxer leaning on his opponent when he goes to these crowds.
[01:51:53.413 --> 01:52:01.177]  You can see that he's like going, I did what you wanted, I'm trying and all they do is lie and they call him racist when he does the opposite.
[01:52:01.177 --> 01:52:08.761]  I mean, you can just see that they got beaten in the election so they tripled all the lies where it's an entire false paradigm.
[01:52:08.761 --> 01:52:11.963]  It's an entire false environment, like a virtual reality of lies.
[01:52:11.963 --> 01:52:13.944]  I mean, here's one example.
[01:52:15.054 --> 01:52:15.935]  All over the news.
[01:52:15.935 --> 01:52:17.776]  Bikers are coming to protest Trump.
[01:52:17.776 --> 01:52:20.878]  They knew nobody was going to be there protesting him in Phoenix.
[01:52:20.878 --> 01:52:22.039]  They had like 200 people.
[01:52:22.039 --> 01:52:27.362]  So they pointed cameras at his crowd and said, look, they're protesting him from 200 yards away.
[01:52:27.362 --> 01:52:29.344]  This is next level lying.
[01:52:29.344 --> 01:52:32.826]  So I'm ranting, Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief.
[01:52:32.826 --> 01:52:35.148]  What is your view on Afghanistan?
[01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:37.069]  But it appears he's beginning to falter.
[01:52:38.956 --> 01:52:39.596]  Well he isn't.
[01:52:39.596 --> 01:52:47.181]  The reason is because Trump does not have the background to back up the sound bites that he instinctively in his gut feeling knew were correct.
[01:52:47.181 --> 01:52:58.428]  Everything about conspiracy to globalism, but he has none of the background to understand the details either of globalism or conspiracy to recognize when it's manipulating him, when it's scaring him in the face.
[01:52:59.108 --> 01:53:07.751]  I mean, you have to know that the Deep State is supplying all the weapons to ISIS and all the other terrorist groups.
[01:53:07.751 --> 01:53:15.753]  And in next week's World Affairs Brief, my major story is going to be about the Bulgarian investigative journalist who just picked up.
[01:53:15.753 --> 01:53:19.014]  They found out where the secret pipeline of weapons from the U.S.
[01:53:19.014 --> 01:53:21.955]  to the terrorists is, and it's through the Azerbaijani
[01:53:22.535 --> 01:53:25.619]  That's the State Department export authorization that Hillary started.
[01:53:43.638 --> 01:53:45.719]  Well, it started clear back in Rumsfeld.
[01:53:45.719 --> 01:53:48.361]  Rumsfeld was the one who made the deal with Azerbaijan.
[01:53:48.361 --> 01:53:53.525]  Sure, but didn't Hillary radically expand it, is my point, during her tenure?
[01:53:53.525 --> 01:53:54.705]  Yes, yes, clearly.
[01:53:54.705 --> 01:53:56.807]  But it was started under the Bush administration.
[01:53:56.807 --> 01:54:01.370]  I mean, the Bush administration was just as much a part of this.
[01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:05.732]  So it's really important to understand we now know the pipeline, and we know that the U.S.
[01:54:05.732 --> 01:54:07.193]  is implicated, and it's amazing.
[01:54:07.193 --> 01:54:07.994]  The only U.S.
[01:54:07.994 --> 01:54:11.556]  source, other than myself, who's picked up on this is 21st Century Wire,
[01:54:13.261 --> 01:54:19.245]  Who covered it yesterday, but it's going to be a big story that the mainstream press will never talk about.
[01:54:19.245 --> 01:54:22.767]  But Trump has been sold a bill of goods in Afghanistan.
[01:54:22.767 --> 01:54:25.588]  He claims that he studied it out and really worked through this.
[01:54:25.588 --> 01:54:28.330]  He didn't study it out at all.
[01:54:28.330 --> 01:54:33.613]  He simply was briefed for hours after hours by the generals until they finally convinced him.
[01:54:33.613 --> 01:54:37.956]  They used photographs of dead civilians and played the old 9-11 card.
[01:54:37.956 --> 01:54:40.717]  They played the card about Osama bin Laden hatching 9-11 in a cave.
[01:54:42.658 --> 01:54:45.619]  Sure, but he did figure out Syria was.
[01:54:45.619 --> 01:54:50.640]  Obama and Hillary have been funding ISIS and Al Qaeda cut their funding off, destroying.
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:57.502]  I was hoping that he finally figured that out there and we were going to kill the funding on this airline as well.
[01:54:57.502 --> 01:55:07.925]  If we can get this to him, that's why they want to keep the info from getting, because just like we got the info to him on Arpaio and they took action, they are freaking out to keep him isolated.
[01:55:09.451 --> 01:55:15.516]  Well, remember that on Syria he did not understand yet that the Deep State was funding ISIS.
[01:55:15.516 --> 01:55:21.761]  He was picking off the funding for the actual rebels, the U.S.-backed rebels.
[01:55:21.761 --> 01:55:26.164]  But I've got no evidence that he really understands the Deep State funding directly of ISIS.
[01:55:26.164 --> 01:55:27.646]  Well, he said Hillary founded ISIS.
[01:55:29.878 --> 01:55:31.079]  But he doesn't have the details.
[01:55:31.079 --> 01:55:36.143]  He picks something up on the internet, but he doesn't have the background and the details to prove his point.
[01:55:36.143 --> 01:55:41.428]  If he's going to go to his national security team and make a case for that, he's got to have the details.
[01:55:41.428 --> 01:55:45.651]  And of course the national security team knows full well what's going on.
[01:55:45.651 --> 01:55:47.232]  Yeah, most of them do.
[01:55:47.232 --> 01:55:50.295]  I mean, look at John McCain's basically was quarterbacking the operation.
[01:55:51.673 --> 01:55:59.300]  Yes, he was very much a part of this, and a lot of these people in the globalist realm in Congress are taking the orders from John McCain.
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:04.826]  And the back story is, every time you talk to people, I talk to Senator McCain and he told me what was what.
[01:56:04.826 --> 01:56:08.790]  I was about to say, you hear this from the Democrats, they call him the Chairman.
[01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:10.571]  Kaine calls him the Chairman.
[01:56:10.571 --> 01:56:13.374]  And they all basically admit they're getting orders from him.
[01:56:13.374 --> 01:56:14.635]  Is McCain kind of like...
[01:56:15.356 --> 01:56:24.645]  The new Brzezinski or kind of like the new Kissinger more and more because it's just it seems like he's the guy or is he getting his orders from Kissinger?
[01:56:24.645 --> 01:56:28.389]  McCain isn't a thinker he doesn't dream these things up but he is the implementer.
[01:56:29.564 --> 01:56:49.957]  He's their go-to man to be able to put Congress in line, and everybody knows you're supposed to listen to John McCain, and nobody criticizes John McCain, who's got a background so black, so false, so pernicious, that if American people really know the real John McCain, they would run from him, but it's being withheld from the American people.
[01:56:49.957 --> 01:56:55.624]  Hanoi Hilton, Keating Five, I mean he is a nasty... Is he not really the leader of the Democratic Party today?
[01:56:55.624 --> 01:56:57.947]  People keep saying it's Pelosi or it's Schumer.
[01:56:57.947 --> 01:56:59.609]  Is it the leader of the Democratic Party?
[01:56:59.609 --> 01:57:04.455]  He's the highest polling person I've seen the polls with the Democrats.
[01:57:04.455 --> 01:57:06.458]  I mean really, John McCain's the leader of the Democratic Party.
[01:57:08.627 --> 01:57:19.374]  Well, they certainly look to him for guidance of where the globalists want them to go, and that means he is one of their, you know, de facto leaders, yes.
[01:57:19.374 --> 01:57:21.795]  Well, what do you think is going to happen to Trump?
[01:57:21.795 --> 01:57:25.218]  Because I see the disrespect of his cabinet against him on television.
[01:57:25.218 --> 01:57:31.201]  They've got him isolated, they know what shows he watches, and then they're on the other programs and other shows literally trashing him.
[01:57:31.201 --> 01:57:31.902]  It is sickening.
[01:57:33.399 --> 01:57:46.608]  Well, they are attempting to build the case for impeachment, and all kinds of stories are floating today about merely advising or asking the Attorney General if he would drop the case as a basis for impeachment.
[01:57:46.608 --> 01:57:48.049]  It's not true at all.
[01:57:48.049 --> 01:57:56.475]  I mean, if you go to actual ends to use the power of the presidency to enforce that request, that might be obstruction of justice, but certainly not
[01:57:57.136 --> 01:58:04.786]  Sure, if you say, hey, do I need to pardon him?
[01:58:04.786 --> 01:58:05.648]  Is this going to go away?
[01:58:05.648 --> 01:58:06.589]  This is flimsy, right?
[01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:07.791]  And they're like, yeah, it's flimsy.
[01:58:07.791 --> 01:58:08.532]  Well, I'll just pardon him.
[01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:16.947]  That's right, and that's what he ended up doing, because Sessions didn't have the guts to, you know, force the dropping of this case.
[01:58:16.947 --> 01:58:28.214]  But these judges are really out to stop Trump on this immigration, and it's amazing the judges came out today, or they didn't come out yet, that it's been a... Hold on, stay there, back in 70 seconds, and Owen Schwerer, you jump in too.
[01:58:28.214 --> 01:58:34.618]  Then we've got our reporter in the middle of the Houston Lake, the Sea of Houston, joining us.
[01:58:34.618 --> 01:58:36.759]  Or is it the Gulf of Houston?
[01:58:36.759 --> 01:58:37.800]  It's not funny, it's...
[01:58:46.295 --> 01:58:53.758]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:58:53.758 --> 01:59:06.982]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:59:19.816 --> 01:59:25.762]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[01:59:48.312 --> 01:59:50.934]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.258 --> 02:00:09.662]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.662 --> 02:00:12.965]  All right, Joel Scalzen, World of Hers Brief.com is our guest.
[02:00:12.965 --> 02:00:22.012]  I'm going to go to break here in about five minutes, come back and go to Brad, Joseph, Dr. Mike, Annette, Sam and others, your take on the situation with Hurricane Harvey.
[02:00:22.012 --> 02:00:25.435]  But I just want to study the globalists.
[02:00:25.435 --> 02:00:27.016]  It is a fight between good and evil.
[02:00:27.016 --> 02:00:29.919]  They will go over and above
[02:00:31.164 --> 02:00:37.308]  What is even good for their own interest and hurt their own interest individually to carry out an anti-christian world government agenda?
[02:00:37.308 --> 02:00:43.032]  And I wanted Joel to be able to finish any other tidbits he had, but just briefly, I knew about this five years ago and couldn't believe it.
[02:00:43.032 --> 02:00:59.143]  I had members of Parliament on from the UK about it, where like most of the new social workers are Muslims, and then the people they give the kids to are Muslims, and they're giving six, seven, eight-year-old little British girls and boys to Muslims who put burqas on them and rip their crosses off.
[02:00:59.143 --> 02:01:00.624]  That's in the times of London!
[02:01:00.624 --> 02:01:00.864]  I mean,
[02:01:03.266 --> 02:01:09.290]  It's just anything to destroy Christians, and it just comes down to that, Bill Skousen, doesn't it?
[02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:10.170]  Well, it does.
[02:01:10.170 --> 02:01:18.656]  And, you know, if the opposite occurred, if you put a Muslim child within a Christian and then forced them to, you know, conform to Christianity, they'd be held to pay.
[02:01:18.656 --> 02:01:20.397]  So it really is a single standard.
[02:01:21.809 --> 02:01:22.989]  That's the way of the future.
[02:01:22.989 --> 02:01:24.970]  I'm afraid it's going to get worse rather than better.
[02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:34.093]  And if you want more proof of that, if you pull up that list of 917 hate groups that they put out, I guarantee you that CARE is not on there, which wants Sharia law.
[02:01:34.093 --> 02:01:37.494]  I guarantee you that Black Lives Matter is not on there, which calls for the killing of cops.
[02:01:37.554 --> 02:01:39.695]  Jihad Watch got banned off PayPal!
[02:01:39.695 --> 02:01:41.857]  Jihad Watch just shows what the jihadis are saying!
[02:01:41.857 --> 02:01:48.020]  So if you don't believe what Alex is saying that there's an attack on Christians, look at that hate list that they put out.
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:51.683]  Look at all the Christian groups that are on that hate list and say, why are they putting these groups on there?
[02:01:51.683 --> 02:01:53.624]  Because they say Christianity is archaic.
[02:01:53.624 --> 02:01:54.524]  The Bible's archaic.
[02:01:54.524 --> 02:01:56.105]  Look at these things that they preach in the Bible.
[02:01:56.105 --> 02:01:57.706]  Well, where are Christians slaughtering people?
[02:01:57.706 --> 02:01:59.247]  Where are Christian suicide bombers?
[02:01:59.247 --> 02:02:00.048]  They don't exist!
[02:02:00.048 --> 02:02:00.788]  It's satanic.
[02:02:00.788 --> 02:02:01.349]  It's satanic.
[02:02:01.349 --> 02:02:03.490]  Joel, what do we do about this?
[02:02:03.490 --> 02:02:05.631]  Because, I mean, I can't handle it anymore.
[02:02:05.631 --> 02:02:06.552]  I am getting really angry.
[02:02:08.325 --> 02:02:09.526]  Well, we have to handle it.
[02:02:09.526 --> 02:02:11.789]  I mean, we can't quit, obviously, and I know you're never going to quit.
[02:02:11.789 --> 02:02:12.610]  Oh, I don't mean like that.
[02:02:12.610 --> 02:02:15.554]  I mean, I want to do more.
[02:02:15.554 --> 02:02:21.901]  Well, as I say, there's only a limited things you can do with the corrupt and controlled court system.
[02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:27.888]  And unfortunately, the courts are the go-to for the left to stop Trump and to stop everything that we're trying to do.
[02:02:29.113 --> 02:02:39.483]  I don't think there is a solution, frankly, other than to continue to divide the country, to continue to, I mean, unity, that is, the right has to compromise to the left.
[02:02:39.483 --> 02:02:40.864]  No, I see what you're saying.
[02:02:40.864 --> 02:02:41.785]  You always preach this.
[02:02:41.785 --> 02:02:42.866]  This is critical.
[02:02:42.866 --> 02:02:45.649]  In fact, hold over, and I promise I'm going to call, but start getting into this now.
[02:02:46.383 --> 02:02:47.103]  You're right.
[02:02:47.103 --> 02:02:56.287]  We have to go ahead and hope we can unify the country and be peaceful and have folks embrace free market and real religious freedom, but we've got to know we're probably going to lose.
[02:02:56.287 --> 02:03:02.329]  The rearguard actions fight them and hold them while we build new communities, while we dig in, while we become self-sufficient.
[02:03:02.329 --> 02:03:04.310]  The answer really is to run to the countryside.
[02:03:06.004 --> 02:03:15.010]  That's right, because ultimately, you cannot survive in a sea of humanity that is turning liberal, that has been propagandized by the public education.
[02:03:15.010 --> 02:03:18.592]  I mean, they're converting many, many more people all the time than we can.
[02:03:18.592 --> 02:03:21.014]  Yeah, your children will be brain-dead zombies like them!
[02:03:21.843 --> 02:03:22.323]  Yeah.
[02:03:22.323 --> 02:03:26.386]  Most conservatives lose their children to the public school system and the liberal thing.
[02:03:26.386 --> 02:03:33.770]  Even Brigham Young University, one of the icons of conservative education, 30% of students voted for Hillary Clinton this last time.
[02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:36.852]  That would be unheard of a decade ago.
[02:03:36.852 --> 02:03:39.453]  But that's what happens in conservative America.
[02:03:39.453 --> 02:03:42.535]  The good news though is that this is forcing a real exodus.
[02:03:42.535 --> 02:03:45.357]  People are finally getting, this isn't a game, this is real.
[02:03:46.775 --> 02:03:47.416]  That's right.
[02:03:47.416 --> 02:03:59.396]  And ultimately, I think, frankly, that's the only silver lining in the cataclysmic wars that will come in the future that's going to drive good people out of the big cities where they're staying because of a job.
[02:03:59.396 --> 02:04:00.699]  And our people will be ready then!
[02:04:01.997 --> 02:04:04.278]  And you have to be ready to band together.
[02:04:04.278 --> 02:04:06.940]  You have to be ready to recognize who you can trust.
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:09.141]  And that's going to be in small towns of America.
[02:04:09.141 --> 02:04:12.122]  People, when they flee the big cities, they're going to congregate.
[02:04:12.122 --> 02:04:16.705]  And I think we're going to have pockets of liberty and research in those areas to resist the global new world war.
[02:04:18.001 --> 02:04:26.026]  Well, let's briefly when we come back and talk about the timetable you think until, because the globalists admit they want societal collapse while they're dug in.
[02:04:26.026 --> 02:04:29.609]  They're engineering their own system where they're dug in, use collapse to reorganize.
[02:04:29.609 --> 02:04:36.673]  You're saying we've got to be dug in ourselves so that we aren't fully overtaken by them in the collapse they're engineering.
[02:04:36.673 --> 02:04:47.341]  We'll spend a few minutes on that, and I promise we're going to Dr. Mike, and then we're going to go to Annette, Sam, Joseph, Brad, and others, and our reporter joins us at the bottom of the hour from Houston, Michael Zimmerman.
[02:04:47.341 --> 02:04:47.841]  Pray for him.
[02:04:51.656 --> 02:04:52.279]  Think about this.
[02:04:57.028 --> 02:05:03.869]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[02:05:03.869 --> 02:05:06.410]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[02:05:06.410 --> 02:05:09.870]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:12.071]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:16.891]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality known concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[02:05:16.891 --> 02:05:19.772]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[02:05:19.772 --> 02:05:23.973]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[02:05:26.873 --> 02:05:27.794]  Unprecedented.
[02:05:27.794 --> 02:05:29.014]  And it's cold-pressed.
[02:05:29.014 --> 02:05:30.955]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[02:05:30.955 --> 02:05:33.916]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science.
[02:05:33.916 --> 02:05:35.337]  These are other what you sell.
[02:05:35.337 --> 02:05:39.339]  BuzzFeed said it's like there's already best-selling stuff that's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[02:05:39.339 --> 02:05:40.559]  Why these aren't anything new?
[02:05:40.559 --> 02:05:44.621]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[02:05:44.621 --> 02:05:44.981]  Dude.
[02:05:44.981 --> 02:05:45.061]  Dude.
[02:05:52.253 --> 02:06:02.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:04.902]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:06:04.902 --> 02:06:07.764]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:06:07.764 --> 02:06:09.265]  It's made in the USA.
[02:06:09.265 --> 02:06:09.385]  It's
[02:06:09.565 --> 02:06:09.825]  I think?
[02:06:32.970 --> 02:06:44.677]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:06:44.677 --> 02:06:47.979]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:06:47.979 --> 02:06:51.582]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:06:52.446 --> 02:07:00.715]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[02:07:00.715 --> 02:07:01.936]  A 360 win.
[02:07:01.936 --> 02:07:08.503]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:07:08.503 --> 02:07:13.188]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[02:07:13.268 --> 02:07:16.431]  Because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[02:07:16.431 --> 02:07:17.452]  Number three.
[02:07:17.452 --> 02:07:21.096]  We're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:07:21.096 --> 02:07:27.602]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:07:27.602 --> 02:07:29.244]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com.
[02:07:29.244 --> 02:07:31.106]  Select your favorite product or products.
[02:07:31.226 --> 02:07:35.391]  Click on AutoShip and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:07:35.391 --> 02:07:38.014]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win.
[02:07:38.014 --> 02:07:41.918]  And with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:07:41.918 --> 02:07:43.580]  10% off on AutoShip.
[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:46.003]  Win, win, win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:46.003 --> 02:07:48.005]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:07:48.005 --> 02:07:51.850]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:07:56.124 --> 02:08:01.790]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:09.718]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:09.718 --> 02:08:19.188]  Your phone calls are coming up here in just a few minutes, but I personally am a father of four, and I need to be near Austin so that I can be in a big metropolitan area.
[02:08:20.373 --> 02:08:28.558]  And it's not as bad as Houston to get out of, but like you pointed out, if you're in downtown Austin and there's a flood or a big disaster, you can't get out, basically, because of the cars.
[02:08:28.558 --> 02:08:46.528]  But I look at my children, and I have to weigh it, like being here to fight the tyranny, but having them be around all the mental illness, all the cultural death that's designed psychologically to mentally wound them, so the system can basically infect them more and take control of them, and then that spiritual death,
[02:08:48.607 --> 02:08:56.153]  Versus, you know, trying to live two hours out in the hill country where it's a lot safer and where the people are genuinely nicer and more real.
[02:08:56.153 --> 02:09:02.218]  Or do I just get out of here and, you know, move to Montana or Utah or, you know, someplace like that?
[02:09:02.218 --> 02:09:04.900]  But then miles away is like any liberal city.
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:05.980]  I mean, Seattle.
[02:09:06.983 --> 02:09:08.906]  Was like a demon cloud.
[02:09:08.906 --> 02:09:12.771]  I mean, sure half the folks were listeners, but they're like, yeah, we live here.
[02:09:12.771 --> 02:09:13.953]  We're just here for business.
[02:09:13.953 --> 02:09:15.015]  We can't believe you're even here.
[02:09:15.015 --> 02:09:16.437]  And that was like the first day I'm there.
[02:09:16.437 --> 02:09:17.338]  I'm like, how bad is it?
[02:09:17.338 --> 02:09:18.259]  They go, have you been on the street?
[02:09:19.065 --> 02:09:34.648]  And the people hate each other, and they're hissing at each other, and they're throwing things at people, and attacking me, and cussing at me, and finally I'd run up and say, talk to me, and they'd throw coffee on me, and they would giggle and smile like something out of a movie, like Linda Blair.
[02:09:34.648 --> 02:09:40.089]  You talk about it being spiritual, people watch these videos, and it's like, yes, that's right, they're gonna get you!
[02:09:40.089 --> 02:09:41.670]  And you're like, man, what is this?
[02:09:41.670 --> 02:09:42.930]  There's a real spirit.
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:10:03.292]  And the globalists admit they plan to have a post-industrial world where they have these corporate and governmental and educational high-tech bases, city-states, within old city-states, or within old cities, and then rural labs and communities, and everybody else is basically locked out of them.
[02:10:03.292 --> 02:10:06.174]  So it's an Elysium model, but not spaceships.
[02:10:06.174 --> 02:10:07.435]  And this is their official plan.
[02:10:08.479 --> 02:10:14.364]  And then the very people being robbed by it on the outside have been taught to love it by programming.
[02:10:14.364 --> 02:10:15.565]  So what do we do?
[02:10:15.565 --> 02:10:17.587]  I mean, you see, I'm not saying give up on Trump.
[02:10:17.587 --> 02:10:18.988]  He's a rearguard action.
[02:10:18.988 --> 02:10:20.269]  Wake people up.
[02:10:20.269 --> 02:10:25.153]  You know, kind of a reprieve, an example of a struggle against globalism.
[02:10:25.153 --> 02:10:27.295]  Globalism is in trouble.
[02:10:27.295 --> 02:10:29.957]  But that's economically and culturally, people are aware of it.
[02:10:29.957 --> 02:10:33.480]  Still, the psychic poison, the demonic poison.
[02:10:34.977 --> 02:10:36.318]  That's what it is.
[02:10:36.318 --> 02:10:39.860]  The mindset, whatever you want to call it, is infected us.
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:42.502]  And I don't know how you get around it or get away from it.
[02:10:42.502 --> 02:10:42.982]  Comment?
[02:10:42.982 --> 02:10:46.324]  Well, I could have easily fallen down that path, Alex.
[02:10:46.324 --> 02:10:48.366]  And that's why I feel so bad for these people.
[02:10:48.366 --> 02:10:50.427]  They have no fulfillment in life.
[02:10:50.427 --> 02:10:52.428]  They feel like they don't have a chance.
[02:10:52.428 --> 02:10:56.511]  And I made the conscious decision, instead of going down that path,
[02:10:57.091 --> 02:11:00.874]  Going down the path of blaming everything else, feeling like you don't have control of your future.
[02:11:00.874 --> 02:11:03.917]  I said, no, I have control of my future.
[02:11:03.917 --> 02:11:06.419]  That's where there's this disconnect right now.
[02:11:06.419 --> 02:11:10.002]  People are either saying they give up their free will to the system.
[02:11:10.002 --> 02:11:10.402]  Exactly.
[02:11:10.402 --> 02:11:11.343]  And it's a laziness thing.
[02:11:11.343 --> 02:11:13.545]  They say, look, the system's already screwed me.
[02:11:13.545 --> 02:11:15.166]  The system's already gone to hell.
[02:11:15.166 --> 02:11:16.828]  America's already gone to hell.
[02:11:16.828 --> 02:11:19.430]  So I'm just going to give up and I'm going to bitch and whine.
[02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:20.591]  And that'll be my virtue.
[02:11:20.831 --> 02:11:23.413]  And a lot of conservatives never get involved.
[02:11:23.413 --> 02:11:24.514]  Now they do that too.
[02:11:24.514 --> 02:11:26.616]  Oh, I knew Trump would be horrible.
[02:11:26.616 --> 02:11:27.857]  Then they desert him.
[02:11:27.857 --> 02:11:29.218]  They're deserting themselves.
[02:11:29.218 --> 02:11:29.899]  That's a great point.
[02:11:29.899 --> 02:11:32.121]  So I don't have a family.
[02:11:32.121 --> 02:11:33.221]  I didn't create a job.
[02:11:33.221 --> 02:11:34.763]  I have nothing that's fulfilled me.
[02:11:34.763 --> 02:11:36.905]  I have nothing that's lifted myself up and lifted others up.
[02:11:36.905 --> 02:11:37.805]  So you know what I'm going to do?
[02:11:37.805 --> 02:11:38.566]  I'm going to go out on the streets.
[02:11:38.566 --> 02:11:43.090]  I'm going to pour coffee on Alex Jones because he's a racist and he's a Nazi.
[02:11:43.090 --> 02:11:44.391]  And so that's their fulfillment.
[02:11:44.391 --> 02:11:46.152]  And you can say, ah, I got him.
[02:11:46.152 --> 02:11:48.695]  I poured coffee on the Nazi.
[02:11:48.695 --> 02:11:49.015]  But no.
[02:11:49.475 --> 02:11:52.579]  No, you're going to go home back to the same life.
[02:11:52.579 --> 02:11:53.761]  It was a simulated victory.
[02:11:53.761 --> 02:11:56.705]  They're working for a real Nazi collaborator.
[02:11:56.705 --> 02:12:01.091]  So, Joel, what is this spiritually and what do we need to do?
[02:12:01.091 --> 02:12:06.738]  Well, this is a complex subject because people have innate set points.
[02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:09.528]  You can notice this when children just grow up.
[02:12:09.528 --> 02:12:13.392]  You know, some people are soft, have liberal mentalities from the very beginning.
[02:12:13.392 --> 02:12:19.017]  They're just open to this, help the poor, help this, and they're susceptible to this.
[02:12:19.017 --> 02:12:26.685]  Other people are hard-nosed detail people, hard-working people who resent, you know, the follow-alongers.
[02:12:26.685 --> 02:12:30.909]  And you're never going to change people that are innately liberal.
[02:12:31.537 --> 02:12:39.601]  I mean, even when hard times, even when war hits them, they still have this rosy-eyed view of optimism in the world.
[02:12:39.601 --> 02:12:45.063]  And so I have viewed that you've got to reach the people who are susceptible to your message.
[02:12:45.063 --> 02:12:46.984]  And you don't worry about the rest.
[02:12:46.984 --> 02:12:50.266]  I don't spend a lot of time trying to convince people who can't see it.
[02:12:50.266 --> 02:12:52.467]  So how do we reach out and find the leaders that are there?
[02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:58.514]  Well, you have to give a tough message, and that's what I try to do.
[02:12:58.514 --> 02:13:06.304]  That's why I don't shrink back from talking about the conspiracy evidence and proofs that we have, and the theories for things we don't have proofs.
[02:13:07.114 --> 02:13:12.899]  Because that's a good litmus test for people to see if they're willing to come that way.
[02:13:12.899 --> 02:13:20.626]  And it's hard, even for conservatives, because they know they'll be blackballed, they'll be criticized, they'll be denigrated for ever uttering a word about conservatives.
[02:13:20.626 --> 02:13:22.488]  But don't they get that's a trap?
[02:13:22.488 --> 02:13:25.050]  It's going to get worse if they're cowards.
[02:13:25.050 --> 02:13:26.191]  We don't do this to be macho.
[02:13:26.191 --> 02:13:30.695]  We're standing against the evil because instinctively, spiritually, we know that's how we get out of it.
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:45.564]  But you know, we're at a disadvantage because it takes a lot of study, learning to understand the details to be able to defend the issues of conspiracy which are running this world.
[02:13:45.564 --> 02:13:50.665]  And you can't just throw out one-liner soundbites and expect those to be accepted.
[02:13:50.665 --> 02:13:53.306]  You've got to have the details and the details take time.
[02:13:53.306 --> 02:13:54.846]  You can't do it in a college class.
[02:13:54.846 --> 02:13:57.447]  You can't counter the professor because it takes time.
[02:13:57.447 --> 02:13:58.948]  And they don't give you the time.
[02:13:58.948 --> 02:13:59.848]  They've got the floor.
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:02.461]  The news media won't give you the time.
[02:14:02.461 --> 02:14:07.424]  Nobody will interview me about conspiracy on the news because I've got the details.
[02:14:07.424 --> 02:14:09.945]  And I know how to make sure they get through.
[02:14:09.945 --> 02:14:15.288]  But you know, they'll always interview if they do interview someone who doesn't know.
[02:14:15.288 --> 02:14:17.069]  So let's expand on what you're saying.
[02:14:20.134 --> 02:14:42.452]  People are busy, they don't want to hear the complexity of it, but you notice world government's now out, the fact that it's unelected is out, the basic facts is what brings it down, and just a few people now knowing has it on its knees, and they've moved from denying it exists to just trying to totally move past it to civil war, which shows it is the understanding of global government, how it works, the fact that it's unelected,
[02:14:43.152 --> 02:14:44.974]  That will bring this system down.
[02:14:44.974 --> 02:14:46.415]  Worldaffairsbrief.com.

[02:14:53.362 --> 02:14:54.944]  Really groundbreaking information.
[02:14:54.944 --> 02:14:57.907]  We link to a lot of it at newswars.com.
[02:14:57.907 --> 02:14:59.689]  Thank you, Joel Skousen.
[02:14:59.689 --> 02:15:00.630]  Pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[02:15:01.690 --> 02:15:10.154]  What's crazy for me is, I've had like ABC Nightly News here, all of them, Megyn Kelly, NBC News, and I say, let me show you a clip of them calling for world government.
[02:15:10.154 --> 02:15:15.536]  Herman Van Rompuy, or the British Prime Minister, they go, we don't want to see that.
[02:15:15.536 --> 02:15:29.682]  And there is a world government, it is corporate, it is above the law, it does want to bring the system in, it does want to make you poor, here's where they say it, and it's just like he said, they just don't want to see it, because the average person goes, that's too scary, I don't want to believe that, like it's make-believe!
[02:15:30.444 --> 02:15:35.627]  Like, if you just make believe they're not putting cancer viruses in vaccines, it goes away.
[02:15:35.627 --> 02:15:36.808]  Or they're part of it.
[02:15:36.808 --> 02:15:40.189]  And you made an amazing point that really hit home to me, Alex.
[02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:42.511]  The instincts to fight this.
[02:15:42.511 --> 02:15:46.013]  The instincts to know that the only way to come out on the other side of this prosperity is
[02:15:46.873 --> 02:15:48.936]  Is to fight it now.
[02:15:48.936 --> 02:15:49.897]  It's like if you drown.
[02:15:49.897 --> 02:15:54.962]  If you throw any wild animal in the water, it instinctually kicks and floats to try to save itself.
[02:15:54.962 --> 02:15:56.324]  But only humans can drown.
[02:15:56.324 --> 02:15:58.266]  They go, I never was taught how to swim.
[02:15:58.266 --> 02:16:00.268]  You instinctively know how to swim.
[02:16:00.268 --> 02:16:01.750]  That's what this is, Alex.
[02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:04.713]  You can throw a month old baby in the water, it'll start swimming.
[02:16:04.833 --> 02:16:08.715]  These people have had their instincts beaten out of them.
[02:16:08.715 --> 02:16:10.976]  They have had their instincts fluorided out of them.
[02:16:10.976 --> 02:16:13.157]  They've had their instincts injected out of them.
[02:16:13.157 --> 02:16:13.617]  And that's it.
[02:16:13.617 --> 02:16:15.318]  We need to get our instincts back.
[02:16:15.318 --> 02:16:16.058]  They're dead, Alex.
[02:16:16.058 --> 02:16:16.599]  They're dead.
[02:16:16.599 --> 02:16:18.780]  Or they're told that their instincts are racist.
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:22.041]  Or they're told that their instincts are just, they're not, they're not liberal.
[02:16:22.041 --> 02:16:25.143]  Floyd Merriweather said, I'm the better man than McGregor.
[02:16:25.143 --> 02:16:27.304]  Imagine if McGregor would have wanted to say that about him.
[02:16:27.304 --> 02:16:27.664]  It's true.
[02:16:27.864 --> 02:16:29.364]  Mayweather is the better man!
[02:16:29.364 --> 02:16:30.945]  Ten years older, all of it.
[02:16:30.945 --> 02:16:31.965]  He is better at boxing.
[02:16:31.965 --> 02:16:33.365]  He is the better man.
[02:16:33.365 --> 02:16:34.425]  So what if he's black?
[02:16:34.425 --> 02:16:36.586]  And there's white guys better than him at certain things.
[02:16:36.586 --> 02:16:37.986]  So what if they're better?
[02:16:37.986 --> 02:16:39.086]  Again, that's not racist.
[02:16:39.086 --> 02:16:39.946]  That's true.
[02:16:39.946 --> 02:16:43.887]  It's not discriminatory to say Mayweather has more stamina as the better boxer.
[02:16:43.887 --> 02:16:45.008]  It's a fact!
[02:16:45.008 --> 02:16:47.168]  Look at that baby struggling to not drown.
[02:16:47.168 --> 02:16:49.108]  Look at how racist it is against the water.
[02:16:49.108 --> 02:16:51.029]  Look at its racist instincts not to die.
[02:16:51.029 --> 02:16:52.809]  It needs to just lay down and die.
[02:16:52.809 --> 02:16:54.589]  That's the only chance they have at survival.
[02:16:54.589 --> 02:16:55.550]  No.
[02:16:55.550 --> 02:16:56.410]  This is what
[02:16:57.250 --> 02:17:02.834]  The globalist conglomerate of international corporations have done to humanity.
[02:17:02.834 --> 02:17:08.678]  Well, they've taken the modern industrial world that makes us weak, that helps us as well, and they've used it against us.
[02:17:08.678 --> 02:17:09.659]  They've backdoored it.
[02:17:09.659 --> 02:17:13.062]  Let's go ahead and go to Dr. Mike, then Annette, Sam, Joseph, and Brad.
[02:17:13.062 --> 02:17:13.862]  I appreciate you guys holding.
[02:17:13.862 --> 02:17:15.343]  Dr. Mike, you're on the air.
[02:17:15.343 --> 02:17:17.545]  Welcome.
[02:17:17.545 --> 02:17:22.829]  Alex, any possibility that you could get Governor Abbott or Dan Patrick or
[02:17:23.447 --> 02:17:39.374]  Maybe one of the NOAA officials on, at least under the pretext of talking about the storm in general, and then kind of blindside them with, hey, why did no one go out and seed the clouds in Harvey while it was still offshore?
[02:17:39.374 --> 02:17:43.876]  I mean, how many times does the Gulf Coast have to go through these horrible storms?
[02:17:43.876 --> 02:17:44.516]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:17:44.516 --> 02:17:46.037]  The globalists have it both ways.
[02:17:47.486 --> 02:17:49.787]  They act like this is the best caller in a long time.
[02:17:49.787 --> 02:17:50.968]  He's so on target.
[02:17:50.968 --> 02:17:52.428]  In fact, I'm watching new shows.
[02:17:52.428 --> 02:17:55.029]  Dr. Mike, you've been calling in 15 years, 18 years.
[02:17:55.029 --> 02:17:56.710]  We need to give you your own show if you want it.
[02:17:56.710 --> 02:17:57.490]  You got a flat Austin.
[02:17:57.490 --> 02:18:00.752]  But the point is, is that they have weather engineering.
[02:18:00.752 --> 02:18:07.935]  In 1967, Stanford Research Institute certified that the Navy could create, control, steer weather weapons.
[02:18:07.935 --> 02:18:09.736]  So then they always spin that that I'm saying.
[02:18:10.885 --> 02:18:12.506]  Let's skip this one break so we have more time.
[02:18:12.506 --> 02:18:16.227]  They're always spinning that to then say that I'm saying the hurricane was controlled.
[02:18:16.227 --> 02:18:16.667]  No.
[02:18:16.667 --> 02:18:17.927]  It's on the Weather Channel.
[02:18:17.927 --> 02:18:18.607]  It's a fact.
[02:18:18.607 --> 02:18:19.928]  I've interviewed the people.
[02:18:19.928 --> 02:18:20.648]  It's going on.
[02:18:20.648 --> 02:18:25.290]  So, yes, why don't they kill these big hurricanes with cloud seeding?
[02:18:25.290 --> 02:18:26.210]  They can kill them.
[02:18:26.210 --> 02:18:27.910]  They can disperse them.
[02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:31.812]  Well, they don't want to admit they have the technologies, but it's already going on.
[02:18:31.812 --> 02:18:32.772]  They already admit it.
[02:18:32.772 --> 02:18:35.233]  And so let me ask Mike, who's a smart guy, a medical doctor,
[02:18:37.051 --> 02:18:42.215]  And I know who Mike is, I've seen him in newspaper articles several years, he's a Republican activist.
[02:18:42.215 --> 02:18:43.115]  Why do you think that is?
[02:18:43.115 --> 02:18:47.378]  Why don't you answer your own question?
[02:18:47.378 --> 02:19:04.370]  Apparently it's just for the reason you cite, because it's considered gauche, I suppose, to let out the cat from the bag, that they have that kind of technology, because then there, you know, so many of them on both sides of the aisle will be accused of
[02:19:06.298 --> 02:19:20.020]  Inertia, I mean how many, from Katrina on... Well that's it, plus they have the 1978 treaty ratified in 79 against weather weapons, and the argument is, you do that, it'll affect somebody else somewhere else.
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:25.961]  So if you dissipate that, maybe there's a computer model that shows that then there's a bigger storm that hits some other place.
[02:19:25.961 --> 02:19:29.982]  But the truth is, the Chinese aren't hiding it, they're full scale ahead weather modification.
[02:19:29.982 --> 02:19:31.922]  The Muslims, the Arabs are doing it everywhere.
[02:19:31.922 --> 02:19:32.943]  Russia too now.
[02:19:32.943 --> 02:19:35.163]  They're all, and then here we just ignore what's going on.
[02:19:35.863 --> 02:19:46.886]  They actually did a drill on the East Coast where they said, hey, we're doing a weather modification drill and they kept having to cancel it because there were too many boats at the port and they didn't want to douse these people in the chemicals.
[02:19:46.886 --> 02:19:47.847]  Well, here's an example.
[02:19:47.847 --> 02:19:50.888]  England just got hit by a giant cloud of gas.
[02:19:50.888 --> 02:19:55.029]  And we don't know that some refinery that blew up in China and it went up in the jet stream and dumped down there.
[02:19:55.029 --> 02:19:56.069]  I mean, who knows what did it?
[02:19:56.069 --> 02:19:58.230]  But there's a lot of stuff going on.
[02:19:58.230 --> 02:20:00.530]  I mean, they've got.
[02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:02.931]  I mean, I talked to the former Hart Project guy.
[02:20:02.931 --> 02:20:04.112]  He called up like 10 years ago.
[02:20:04.112 --> 02:20:05.032]  He goes, I want to come on.
[02:20:05.734 --> 02:20:08.356]  And he really came on and no media picked it up.
[02:20:08.356 --> 02:20:11.818]  And then like six months later he was relieved of command or whatever.
[02:20:11.818 --> 02:20:26.089]  And then I had other... Ben Parton was the head of HAARP up in Alaska, former head of the Air Force, but at that time had a HAARP and he wouldn't get into it, but he said it was over the horizon radar that could actually see stuff over the horizon.
[02:20:26.809 --> 02:20:30.673]  And he said that part was declassified, but that they could also fire a beam.
[02:20:30.673 --> 02:20:36.498]  Seen the movie Core, where they've got a big thing up in Alaska and it's able to basically manipulate the Earth's core?
[02:20:36.498 --> 02:20:38.800]  Well, they reportedly really have stuff like that.
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:40.402]  And that's also what's up there in Alaska.
[02:20:40.402 --> 02:20:45.046]  It's, look, 1900 equations created atomic bombs.
[02:20:45.046 --> 02:20:47.849]  Now, we're 117 years later, Dr. Mike.
[02:20:47.849 --> 02:20:48.870]  What do you think they got now?
[02:20:52.408 --> 02:20:53.648]  God only knows.
[02:20:53.648 --> 02:20:55.269]  I don't even really want to think about it.
[02:20:55.269 --> 02:21:10.192]  You know, you've mentioned before that the Air Force acknowledges that it has antimatter weapons that it's not even capable of controlling to the extent that they can use them, you know, predictably, they might end up destroying the Earth.
[02:21:10.192 --> 02:21:18.394]  So anything between that and a suitcase nuke, I mean, your imagination is the limit.
[02:21:18.394 --> 02:21:20.335]  The particle beams,
[02:21:21.403 --> 02:21:24.506]  You know, the old, what did they develop under Reagan?
[02:21:24.506 --> 02:21:32.192]  The pellets, the gravity weapons, the uranium pellets that could be dropped down basically under a gravity well.
[02:21:32.192 --> 02:21:33.353]  Gravity weapons.
[02:21:33.353 --> 02:21:33.753]  Gravity bombs.
[02:21:33.753 --> 02:21:35.034]  Like a meteor when it hit the ground.
[02:21:35.034 --> 02:21:37.096]  Meteor guns.
[02:21:37.096 --> 02:21:38.457]  Yeah.
[02:21:38.457 --> 02:21:41.499]  What do they call it, smart pebble?
[02:21:41.499 --> 02:21:48.565]  Yeah, and I've heard from ex-Air Force guys that, this guy said he watched a demonstration
[02:21:49.869 --> 02:21:53.132]  Of a dummy dressed up like a human.
[02:21:53.132 --> 02:21:59.496]  They fired some weapon at it from a hundred or two hundred yards away and it just literally disintegrated.
[02:21:59.496 --> 02:22:02.899]  Well yeah, look at what happened to the... Well, let's go back to this.
[02:22:02.899 --> 02:22:07.462]  Tell us what your Air Force buddy told you, sorry, about this disintegration, Ray, or what?
[02:22:07.462 --> 02:22:15.668]  Yeah, and I don't think he was privy to what the array was composed of, but
[02:22:16.886 --> 02:22:32.750]  You know, this is why I think these guys are so, you ask constantly, why are these guys getting so uppity to the point that they just, they don't care that, you know, what they're doing is revealed.
[02:22:32.750 --> 02:22:46.094]  I think they've got such weapons between microwave weapons and, you know, killer beams like the one this Air Force guy described to me, that, you know, when the time comes, you know,
[02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:56.215]  Our rifles, even, you know, a long-range rifle, a .50 caliber Barrett, will be totally inadequate.
[02:22:56.215 --> 02:23:02.357]  You know, once you had a laser fired into your retinas and you've been blinded, you know, what good is that?
[02:23:02.357 --> 02:23:03.438]  I've got those dazzlers.
[02:23:03.438 --> 02:23:10.861]  Well, let's expand on that because I want to hear every bit of this because I've talked to people that were in Panama and they said whatever they had mounted on these C-130s,
[02:23:12.961 --> 02:23:19.114]  They would just pass it over and everything on the whole street would just vaporize basically.
[02:23:19.114 --> 02:23:23.162]  So obviously a disintegration beam.
[02:23:24.204 --> 02:23:26.006]  And we know they've got this kind of stuff.
[02:23:26.006 --> 02:23:35.254]  The Air Force in the San Francisco Chronicle, on purpose, about 15 years ago, 16 years ago, admitted, yeah, we've got antimatter weapons, but, you know, we're not going to give you the specs on that.
[02:23:35.254 --> 02:23:40.098]  And these are weapons so powerful you can't test them because it'll blow the whole planet up or the solar system.
[02:23:40.098 --> 02:23:41.920]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:45.743]  And so anything you're being shown is decades and decades.
[02:23:45.743 --> 02:23:47.404]  Reagan didn't launch the Star Wars program.
[02:23:47.404 --> 02:23:47.905]  It was there.
[02:23:47.905 --> 02:23:50.167]  Dr. Bob Bowman broke down a lot of that.
[02:23:50.427 --> 02:24:01.868]  He was the first guy that told me about the Pebbles, and he could only talk about those because they'd messed up and declassified it with one of the directors on C-SPAN in a debate with him.
[02:24:03.267 --> 02:24:07.049]  You know, talking about how great these things work.
[02:24:07.049 --> 02:24:21.538]  So they've got just this incredible array, and that's why the elites are so arrogant, is because they've got life extension technologies, they've got all this stuff, and they're busy trying to make Christian children be taken and given to Muslims in foster care.
[02:24:21.538 --> 02:24:24.840]  They're too busy trying to make churches teach about trainees.
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:26.641]  And again, it's all spiritual.
[02:24:26.641 --> 02:24:28.942]  They want to destroy Christians.
[02:24:28.942 --> 02:24:30.343]  They want a one world government.
[02:24:30.643 --> 02:24:37.107]  The Southern Poverty Law Center is now, with Amazon and others, not letting major churches engage in commerce.
[02:24:37.107 --> 02:24:38.188]  It's here.
[02:24:38.188 --> 02:24:46.173]  So whether you believe in the Bible or not, the globalists hate Christians, and they're creating a mark of the beast where Christians can't buy and sell.
[02:24:46.173 --> 02:24:52.938]  Most churches are going to roll over and grovel and not even be Christian now, so they can have their glitterbug preachers, you know, run around.
[02:24:52.938 --> 02:24:59.602]  The answer is have Christians really spend money with other Christians and support each other and file lawsuits against these groups.
[02:24:59.602 --> 02:25:00.503]  Anything else, Dr. Mike?
[02:25:02.405 --> 02:25:04.787]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:25:04.787 --> 02:25:09.911]  I think this is essentially a spiritual battle, and I think that's where they want to win it.
[02:25:09.911 --> 02:25:19.179]  Why blow people up if you can simply turn their minds around to the point that they ask for the shackles to be put on them?
[02:25:19.179 --> 02:25:21.381]  And this is, you know, these Luciferians
[02:25:22.179 --> 02:25:24.901]  I don't think they want to take away free will.
[02:25:24.901 --> 02:25:28.824]  That's one thing, you know, I tip my hat to him on.
[02:25:28.824 --> 02:25:30.505]  They want us to ask for tyranny.
[02:25:30.505 --> 02:25:34.608]  You know, please, Uncle Sam, just keep us safe.
[02:25:34.608 --> 02:25:37.190]  Just do whatever you need to do.
[02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:42.173]  Well, they metaphysically need to trick us into thinking we're giving up the free will to be the slaves.
[02:25:42.173 --> 02:25:45.596]  They want you to use free will to become their slaves, just like Faust.
[02:25:47.133 --> 02:25:50.754]  So they want you to believe you're giving over your soul and your free will.
[02:25:50.754 --> 02:25:53.195]  They want your will.
[02:25:53.195 --> 02:25:55.316]  It's beyond they don't want to get rid of your free will.
[02:25:55.316 --> 02:25:56.216]  They want your will.
[02:25:56.216 --> 02:25:58.317]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:25:58.317 --> 02:25:59.818]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:25:59.818 --> 02:26:03.599]  Because we spiritually are the ultimate weapon in the made in the image of God.
[02:26:03.599 --> 02:26:04.699]  So they can't get God.
[02:26:04.699 --> 02:26:07.100]  They want God's greatest creation.
[02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:08.601]  And hence the Bible all comes true.
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:09.740]  Yeah, sure.
[02:26:39.475 --> 02:26:48.805]  And you can have remember the story a few years ago you were covering it the police force announces that now they have this technology that they can see into your rooms they can be outside of the house.
[02:26:48.805 --> 02:26:50.227]  That was around 30 years ago.
[02:26:50.227 --> 02:26:53.791]  And you were sitting here you were like reading the story like I report on this decades ago why so
[02:26:55.012 --> 02:26:59.636]  My belief is, if I can conceive it in my mind, somebody out there has probably already killed him.
[02:26:59.636 --> 02:27:00.237]  And let's explain.
[02:27:00.237 --> 02:27:08.123]  They get the intelligence agencies and the cops and everybody to join the globalist system in the name of good, and then they get a lower level of a secret society.
[02:27:08.123 --> 02:27:09.684]  But you don't get up to the top.
[02:27:09.684 --> 02:27:11.126]  You don't get anywhere near that.
[02:27:11.126 --> 02:27:14.469]  You're only given certain Trojan horse stuff they want you to have.
[02:27:14.469 --> 02:27:18.472]  There's Michael Zimmerman, if you're a TV viewer, we're going to him there in Houston after the break.
[02:27:18.472 --> 02:27:20.033]  Doing a great job down there to report.
[02:27:20.033 --> 02:27:20.634]  Thank you, Dr. Mike.
[02:27:20.634 --> 02:27:21.534]  We're going to get your info.
[02:27:21.534 --> 02:27:22.956]  I'm going to start getting him on as a regular guest.
[02:27:23.436 --> 02:27:24.457]  And we'll introduce who he is.
[02:27:24.457 --> 02:27:25.178]  He's a medical doctor.
[02:27:25.178 --> 02:27:25.599]  Good guy.
[02:27:25.599 --> 02:27:27.241]  Sent us a lot of good intel over the years.
[02:27:27.241 --> 02:27:29.503]  Let's go to Annette in Oklahoma.
[02:27:29.503 --> 02:27:30.685]  Annette, thanks for holding.
[02:27:30.685 --> 02:27:33.668]  You're on the air.
[02:27:33.668 --> 02:27:37.352]  This mayor didn't just not tell his people to evacuate.
[02:27:37.352 --> 02:27:39.375]  He told them to shelter in place, which is
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:40.841]  Different.
[02:27:40.841 --> 02:27:48.586]  That has a chilling effect on travel and also he didn't try to move the vulnerable populations like the nursing homes and the elderly to higher ground.
[02:27:48.586 --> 02:27:58.233]  I went to A&M and I'm familiar with the area and I knew I had to come down there to pick up a horse and I knew the beginning of last week that this was going to be a problem and there was going to be 20 inches of rain.
[02:27:58.233 --> 02:28:02.016]  So if people, if these mayors of these cities are so invested in
[02:28:02.556 --> 02:28:15.819]  Let me stop you right there.
[02:28:15.819 --> 02:28:17.420]  This lady is so smart.
[02:28:17.420 --> 02:28:22.001]  See, I already knew all this, and then she calls in all the... You're not supposed to say shelter in place.
[02:28:22.001 --> 02:28:25.161]  You're supposed to tell people that are in the low water areas to get out.
[02:28:25.161 --> 02:28:27.502]  All the default stuff wasn't done.
[02:28:27.502 --> 02:28:29.142]  What is wrong with Democrats?
[02:28:29.142 --> 02:28:30.583]  Why are they so evil?
[02:28:30.583 --> 02:28:31.503]  Go ahead, Annette, continue.
[02:28:32.746 --> 02:28:36.509]  You know, it is a good and evil battle, and they're all invested.
[02:28:36.509 --> 02:28:37.589]  They're all on the same page.
[02:28:37.589 --> 02:28:39.170]  They all walk in lockstep.
[02:28:39.170 --> 02:28:44.654]  But it's up to us as voters to look at these people and say, if they're just going to let it hang out there.
[02:28:44.654 --> 02:28:49.197]  When I was at A&M, it seemed like they would evacuate the city in sections.
[02:28:49.197 --> 02:28:50.838]  And sure, they had a problem.
[02:28:50.838 --> 02:28:51.919]  I mean, it was congestion.
[02:28:51.919 --> 02:28:53.060]  It's Houston.
[02:28:53.060 --> 02:28:54.461]  But they got people out.
[02:28:54.461 --> 02:28:55.822]  But this time, they didn't even try.
[02:28:55.822 --> 02:28:59.664]  And to throw up your hands and say, I'm just going to let my constituents hang?
[02:28:59.664 --> 02:29:01.946]  Well, that's the big question, because
[02:29:03.146 --> 02:29:13.490]  It's now come out in emails and the city council's having to admit they secretly three days before said we're just gonna keep people in the dark we know this is coming we're gonna cut why why make it as bad as you could.
[02:29:13.490 --> 02:29:22.053]  And I'll let people off the hook we have to hold their feet to the fire because if we don't then somebody else is going to die in another town look what happened to Ray Nagin look what happened.
[02:29:22.053 --> 02:29:23.614]  Well hold on I'm gonna come back and I'm
[02:29:23.814 --> 02:29:27.435]  I'm going to come back to you and Michael Zimmerman because we're about to talk to him, a reporter.
[02:29:27.435 --> 02:29:29.855]  He's down there in Houston in the middle of it and has family down there.
[02:29:29.855 --> 02:29:31.576]  I'm going to finish up with you Annette and others.
[02:29:31.576 --> 02:29:32.516]  Why would they do this?
[02:29:32.516 --> 02:29:36.657]  Well clearly, it's to sabotage, make it as bad as possible, and blame Trump.
[02:29:36.657 --> 02:29:38.317]  They did this premeditatedly.
[02:29:38.317 --> 02:29:39.618]  The facts are in.
[02:29:39.618 --> 02:29:40.258]  Pure evil.
[02:29:40.258 --> 02:29:41.638]  They're just evil.
[02:29:41.638 --> 02:29:44.019]  The Democrats openly are like Satan's party.
[02:29:44.019 --> 02:29:44.579]  They are.
[02:29:44.579 --> 02:29:49.260]  Republicans are bad too, but the Democrats are like, just, they're pure evil.
[02:29:56.604 --> 02:30:03.426]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[02:30:03.426 --> 02:30:05.987]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[02:30:05.987 --> 02:30:09.428]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[02:30:09.428 --> 02:30:11.629]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[02:30:11.629 --> 02:30:16.451]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[02:30:16.451 --> 02:30:19.332]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[02:30:19.332 --> 02:30:23.533]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[02:30:26.434 --> 02:30:27.355]  Unprecedented.
[02:30:27.355 --> 02:30:28.576]  And it's cold-pressed.
[02:30:28.576 --> 02:30:30.518]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[02:30:30.518 --> 02:30:33.481]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science.
[02:30:33.481 --> 02:30:36.864]  These are other, what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[02:30:36.864 --> 02:30:38.926]  It's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[02:30:38.926 --> 02:30:40.127]  Why these aren't anything new?
[02:30:40.127 --> 02:30:44.191]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[02:30:44.191 --> 02:30:44.671]  Dude.
[02:30:44.671 --> 02:30:44.771]  Dude.
[02:30:51.997 --> 02:30:53.899]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:30:53.899 --> 02:30:55.921]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:30:55.921 --> 02:30:58.724]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:30:58.724 --> 02:31:04.890]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:04.890 --> 02:31:14.099]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:14.099 --> 02:31:16.281]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[02:31:16.561 --> 02:31:21.607]  Your co-workers, your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:21.607 --> 02:31:29.636]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:29.636 --> 02:31:30.738]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:31.824 --> 02:31:35.749]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:35.749 --> 02:31:39.334]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:39.334 --> 02:31:46.042]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:46.042 --> 02:31:50.227]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:52.475 --> 02:31:57.197]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:31:57.197 --> 02:32:08.003]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[02:32:08.063 --> 02:32:08.223]  I think?
[02:32:26.334 --> 02:32:27.275]  We're good to go.
[02:33:13.547 --> 02:33:16.730]  From the front lines.
[02:33:16.730 --> 02:33:26.159]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.159 --> 02:33:27.641]  Oh my good buddy, Michael Zimmerman.
[02:33:29.039 --> 02:33:34.803]  After you got your two days down there inside the hurricane, he went down to Houston, his hometown.
[02:33:34.803 --> 02:33:37.205]  He lived in Austin and Houston growing up.
[02:33:37.205 --> 02:33:38.425]  Got a family of both.
[02:33:38.425 --> 02:33:41.107]  He went down there and he has an assistant.
[02:33:41.107 --> 02:33:44.089]  Even though he went by himself, I guess he's recruited some locals to help him.
[02:33:44.089 --> 02:33:49.553]  And he's been out there on his kayak, getting amazing photos and videos that are at Infowars.com.
[02:33:49.553 --> 02:33:56.698]  Even more, once I guess he gets out of there tonight and is able to upload more, but he's gotten to an area where he's able to get some internet, some Skype.
[02:33:56.698 --> 02:33:58.699]  We've got Annette who we're going back to, then Sam.
[02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:02.484]  Brad, Joseph, HB, and others that are holding.
[02:34:02.484 --> 02:34:04.066]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:34:04.066 --> 02:34:07.311]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com are the websites.
[02:34:09.033 --> 02:34:13.675]  I tried to be kind to the mayor, and not just score political points, because I've been a non-partisan person.
[02:34:13.675 --> 02:34:16.416]  Everybody knows that I don't like the Republican Party establishment.
[02:34:16.416 --> 02:34:19.397]  In fact, they're even worse than the Democrats, because they've got their act together.
[02:34:19.397 --> 02:34:21.378]  At least act like they're doing some good things.
[02:34:21.378 --> 02:34:23.259]  You know, Paul Ryan and them are monsters.
[02:34:23.259 --> 02:34:29.982]  But you had the Democrat Sylvester Turner, we played the clip earlier, saying, oh it's dumb, you can't evacuate a town this big.
[02:34:29.982 --> 02:34:34.103]  Well, we had an emergency management expert, Joel Skousen, one of the top ones in the country, on.
[02:34:34.103 --> 02:34:36.605]  He said, listen, I've looked at the maps.
[02:34:36.605 --> 02:34:37.405]  He's written a book about it.
[02:34:38.476 --> 02:34:41.557]  Whole chapters, you know, on cities like Houston.
[02:34:41.557 --> 02:34:43.037]  500,000 are in the real flood area.
[02:34:43.037 --> 02:34:44.658]  You tell them to get out of it.
[02:34:44.658 --> 02:34:46.178]  That's how it's always been growing up for me.
[02:34:46.178 --> 02:34:48.739]  And if you're in these flood areas, you evacuate.
[02:34:48.739 --> 02:34:50.619]  The local city emergency management says it.
[02:34:50.619 --> 02:34:51.619]  They did none of it.
[02:34:51.619 --> 02:34:53.640]  So we're asking on air, why is this happening?
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:57.821]  Then our writer Dan Lyman finds that it's in the local news.
[02:34:57.821 --> 02:35:05.063]  Houston officials downplayed flood warnings as fake news when they knew it was going to flood and decided to tell people to shelter in place.
[02:35:05.063 --> 02:35:06.483]  And the caller called in a net.
[02:35:08.223 --> 02:35:25.070]  And was pointing out, and she was reminding me, you always go to the nursing homes, you always go to the prisons, you always go to the low-lying, they have maps, and they put up signs, and radio and TV says, you know, emergency management in the city of Houston and these counties say if you're in these areas, evacuate to higher ground.
[02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:26.531]  Evacuate to higher ground.
[02:35:26.531 --> 02:35:31.813]  In fact, I was thinking about the emergency flood alerts that I've always seen in central Texas, because it's limestone here.
[02:35:31.813 --> 02:35:33.994]  So you get three or four inches of rain in an hour?
[02:35:33.994 --> 02:35:35.195]  I mean, you're talking about
[02:35:35.735 --> 02:35:39.357]  A creek being like the Colorado River in a few minutes.
[02:35:39.357 --> 02:35:44.000]  I mean just trees shooting down at 20 miles an hour.
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.601]  It's scary.
[02:35:45.601 --> 02:35:47.122]  But no!
[02:35:47.122 --> 02:35:49.423]  I mean we can show the time-lapse photos for TV viewers.
[02:35:49.423 --> 02:35:56.988]  They're on Infowars.com where it shows hours before what it was like in downtown Houston and later 25 feet deep.
[02:35:56.988 --> 02:36:02.251]  I mean just unbelievable devastation and
[02:36:03.663 --> 02:36:11.305]  They ordered a stand down and then they made fun of the governor, warning people to get out days before and just said you can't do it, even though they've done it before.
[02:36:11.305 --> 02:36:18.108]  If you're in an area that's going to be in 25 feet of water, if you've got a house on the side of the creeks coming into Houston, get out!
[02:36:18.108 --> 02:36:22.029]  I mean, my ex-wife lives at the house that I have out in the country with Ripon Springs.
[02:36:23.777 --> 02:36:29.940]  And it's on Barton Creek, and the sucker, when it rains bad, gets right up to the house, right up to the stilts it's on.
[02:36:29.940 --> 02:36:32.801]  Because it's built right there, so it's on stilts.
[02:36:32.801 --> 02:36:34.802]  But still, it's come halfway up the stilts.
[02:36:34.802 --> 02:36:35.883]  I said, hey, I'm sure you're getting out.
[02:36:35.883 --> 02:36:36.403]  She goes, yeah.
[02:36:36.403 --> 02:36:38.184]  I said, listen, I'll pay for the hotel.
[02:36:38.184 --> 02:36:43.587]  And the hurricane didn't really hit us, so the thing got out of bounds, but it didn't flood the house.
[02:36:43.587 --> 02:36:45.247]  I'm not even the main hurricane.
[02:36:45.247 --> 02:36:47.989]  And I got my children with her part of the time.
[02:36:48.629 --> 02:36:50.750]  I think there's a number of elements involved.
[02:37:16.980 --> 02:37:20.561]  I think there is a little bit of truth with saying it is difficult to evacuate the city.
[02:37:20.561 --> 02:37:24.842]  When I was younger, we went from Houston to Austin to stay with some family there.
[02:37:24.842 --> 02:37:28.964]  And it took us 30 hours to leave town and actually make it to Austin.
[02:37:28.964 --> 02:37:35.886]  So it is difficult to get, you know, six and a half million people, a good quarter of the state's population, out of an area.
[02:37:35.886 --> 02:37:39.047]  Which I understand what you're saying, you know, you only need to evacuate the ones at higher risk.
[02:37:39.047 --> 02:37:41.307]  But isn't it 10 million if you count the surrounding counties?
[02:37:44.887 --> 02:37:47.532]  Yeah, it's closer to that, yes.
[02:37:47.532 --> 02:37:47.953]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:37:47.953 --> 02:37:50.137]  It's definitely a huge metro area.
[02:37:50.137 --> 02:37:55.668]  But what I have seen, though, is the response from the sheriff's department, the police departments here in Houston.
[02:37:56.363 --> 02:37:58.605]  All these guys working like double shifts.
[02:37:58.605 --> 02:38:01.768]  Yeah, there's some footage on screen right now of last night.
[02:38:01.768 --> 02:38:08.613]  The hotel I was staying at, all the restaurants are closed, and in order to get some dinner, they told us it'd be two hours, because their kitchen was so backed up.
[02:38:08.613 --> 02:38:11.516]  Everyone staying there is eating there at the hotel.
[02:38:11.516 --> 02:38:15.859]  So this guy was like, hey, I'm going to these friends' houses a few miles away.
[02:38:15.859 --> 02:38:16.720]  You know, you can come with me.
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:17.641]  We'll get some food there.
[02:38:17.641 --> 02:38:18.882]  And I had great food.
[02:38:18.882 --> 02:38:21.144]  No water on the roads on the way there.
[02:38:21.144 --> 02:38:25.027]  Just two hours later, coming back, there's like a good foot and a half of water covering the streets.
[02:38:25.970 --> 02:38:28.392]  And this is in a higher ground area?
[02:38:28.392 --> 02:38:29.213]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:38:29.213 --> 02:38:35.578]  This area was not nearly as flooded as the areas that are still underwater, which the areas that are affected the worst, I cannot get to.
[02:38:35.578 --> 02:38:41.883]  I was not able to actually get to this part of town that I'm in right now over in Meyerland yesterday because the whole freeway is underwater.
[02:38:41.883 --> 02:38:48.368]  So just today, by driving backwards on the exit ramp and getting on the freeway, we were able to get to this part of town.
[02:38:48.368 --> 02:38:49.729]  That just was not possible yesterday.
[02:38:50.518 --> 02:38:59.972]  What do you think of the Democrats, though, covering this up and not telling folks in low-lying areas to evacuate?
[02:38:59.972 --> 02:39:01.073]  It's really shameful.
[02:39:01.073 --> 02:39:06.962]  They should know better that Houston floods like this, it's happened before just two years ago in the spring.
[02:39:07.802 --> 02:39:11.326]  Just out of nowhere, there was a huge flood like this.
[02:39:11.326 --> 02:39:14.749]  Not nearly to this extent, but entire areas were flooded.
[02:39:14.749 --> 02:39:16.291]  Cars were flooded out.
[02:39:16.291 --> 02:39:20.094]  And as you can see in all these clips, there's just vehicles all over the city that have been flooded.
[02:39:20.094 --> 02:39:21.816]  Doesn't everybody remember?
[02:39:21.816 --> 02:39:27.121]  They got rid of it like 10 years ago, but growing up on the cable channel in Dallas, but also here, it would show your state.
[02:39:28.055 --> 02:39:32.257]  And it was the robot voice going, this is the NOAA weather channel.
[02:39:32.257 --> 02:39:34.558]  In these counties, get to higher ground.
[02:39:34.558 --> 02:39:38.621]  In these counties, if you're in a low water area, evacuate.
[02:39:38.621 --> 02:39:48.406]  And they would say it's estimated the hurricane, and it would have the radar going in a circle, and then it would show the weather doppler before cable even had it, or news channels had it.
[02:39:48.406 --> 02:39:49.826]  It would show it as...
[02:39:51.227 --> 02:39:56.431]  As the radar spun around the state, but there was always a robot voice.
[02:39:56.431 --> 02:39:57.952]  Since when did they just get rid of that?
[02:39:57.952 --> 02:40:04.336]  Like, the more technology we get, now we're left with some idiot mayor who won't tell you if you live by a river or evacuate.
[02:40:04.336 --> 02:40:06.137]  And I get Joel Scalza's point.
[02:40:06.137 --> 02:40:09.880]  If you live by a river and you live in a place in low-lying area, you need to get out.
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:14.963]  I mean, in a way, I guess it isn't the mayor's fault.
[02:40:14.963 --> 02:40:17.405]  Are we living in idiocracy, Michael Zimmerman?
[02:40:18.676 --> 02:40:24.619]  As a family, we always used to evacuate during these things, but my whole family has always approached things with the whole prepper mindset.
[02:40:24.619 --> 02:40:33.022]  We've also always had weeks worth of food, medicine, supplies, and water filtration, because things like this do happen.
[02:40:33.022 --> 02:40:42.846]  And people need to individually prepare themselves, because yeah, you may have some idiot mayor who tells you that flood warnings are fake news, and people are going to die because of that.
[02:40:42.846 --> 02:40:43.727]  He said it's fake news!
[02:40:44.994 --> 02:40:46.575]  He didn't just say, don't worry about it.
[02:40:46.575 --> 02:40:48.616]  He said, shut up, Governor.
[02:40:48.616 --> 02:40:56.440]  Even here in Austin, I remember when I first saw the reports coming out, I think it was on Wednesday, of the tropical storm moving up the Gulf.
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:57.441]  I'm not even from Texas.
[02:40:57.441 --> 02:40:58.942]  I don't even have experience in this.
[02:40:58.942 --> 02:41:06.766]  I immediately went to the grocery store, got four gallons of water, got a ton of food and filled my fridge and everything, because I was like, I'm probably going to have to hunker down.
[02:41:06.766 --> 02:41:07.567]  It should be a given.
[02:41:10.029 --> 02:41:10.509]  Absolutely.
[02:41:10.509 --> 02:41:19.014]  Yeah, you need to, and even if it's just canned soups or something, having an entire pantry, a whole shelf of that full, you need a gallon a day per person, or more.
[02:41:19.014 --> 02:41:25.978]  Well, I live 200 feet above a creek, so I don't have to worry, but that sucker went up by 10 feet.
[02:41:25.978 --> 02:41:27.719]  And then probably just like that, too.
[02:41:27.719 --> 02:41:33.582]  Oh yeah, I mean, I can look over my back porch and it's like, it was like this little creek and I was like, it's this huge rushing river now.
[02:41:34.431 --> 02:41:35.152]  Yeah, don't evacuate.
[02:41:35.152 --> 02:41:35.933]  You'll be fine.
[02:41:35.933 --> 02:41:38.156]  It's continuing to rain here in Houston, too.
[02:41:38.156 --> 02:41:42.963]  It's slowed down a little bit, but it's been raining the entire day today.
[02:41:42.963 --> 02:41:45.927]  If part of it goes back out in the Gulf, it may reconstitute and come back in.
[02:41:46.829 --> 02:41:47.629]  Exactly.
[02:41:47.629 --> 02:41:52.431]  And the shot of the thing that looks like a river flowing here, that's the Braze Bayou.
[02:41:52.431 --> 02:41:54.311]  And it goes through an area called Brazewood and Meyerland.
[02:41:54.311 --> 02:41:56.552]  And these are older communities.
[02:41:56.552 --> 02:41:58.952]  They have houses that aren't as built up.
[02:41:58.952 --> 02:42:03.114]  So when these areas get hit, these homes just get completely flooded out.
[02:42:03.114 --> 02:42:05.534]  And this is the worst flood in history.
[02:42:05.534 --> 02:42:08.055]  In the history of the whole country.
[02:42:08.055 --> 02:42:08.595]  That's right.
[02:42:08.595 --> 02:42:14.637]  In fact, since this morning they were saying the worst in Texas, now Meteorologist are saying this may be the worst ever and it's not over.
[02:42:15.771 --> 02:42:16.352]  Exactly.
[02:42:16.352 --> 02:42:18.173]  Yeah, this is going to continue for a few more days.
[02:42:18.173 --> 02:42:22.997]  Certain areas, I actually, I sent in some photos, and you can see the water line in these areas.
[02:42:22.997 --> 02:42:27.860]  You can see water was at least five, six feet up these people's houses, and it's completely gone today.
[02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:30.402]  So certain areas have drained out.
[02:42:30.402 --> 02:42:31.163]  There we go.
[02:42:31.163 --> 02:42:36.467]  So that you can see right at the shades there, that black line on the wall is where the water was.
[02:42:36.467 --> 02:42:39.790]  Wow, so that's about, what, six feet?
[02:42:39.790 --> 02:42:40.050]  Easily.
[02:42:42.398 --> 02:42:45.640]  It's all these people's cars, everything inside, there's nothing that can be done.
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:52.044]  So, I imagine these people may have evacuated because this area, they got flooded about two years ago.
[02:42:52.044 --> 02:42:58.467]  And I remember these exact houses, there were big piles of all their carpet and belongings that had got soaked.
[02:42:58.467 --> 02:43:04.391]  Wow, incredible footage of the evil redneck army that's there saving everybody.
[02:43:04.391 --> 02:43:09.814]  Why do we see these evil white guys all over the country just show up and save everybody every time?
[02:43:10.882 --> 02:43:15.504]  Well, I've got a clip of people helping people out of a boat that I sent to them too.
[02:43:15.504 --> 02:43:16.884]  I believe they ran it yesterday's show.
[02:43:16.884 --> 02:43:23.806]  And by the way, it's also black folks, Hispanics and others you see, but there's something about rednecks with their boats and preparedness as a stereotype.
[02:43:23.806 --> 02:43:28.068]  Why is it always rednecks coming in with all their gear, shaving people and having a good time doing it?
[02:43:29.361 --> 02:43:36.483]  Well, and the ones I saw launching these votes, it was Mexicans that invited me to dinner last night, because they knew, hey, this guy doesn't have food.
[02:43:36.483 --> 02:43:37.303]  Come with us.
[02:43:37.303 --> 02:43:37.723]  Absolutely.
[02:43:37.723 --> 02:43:41.184]  I'm being storcastic when I say the whites are all racist, so they must be.
[02:43:41.184 --> 02:43:43.404]  I mean, go ahead and write your story.
[02:43:43.404 --> 02:43:46.565]  It's this division narrative that gets pushed, and it's just not happening.
[02:43:46.565 --> 02:43:49.206]  When hard times come, people help each other.
[02:43:49.206 --> 02:43:51.946]  It's not about black or white or left or right.
[02:43:51.946 --> 02:43:54.787]  It comes down to people are helping their fellow man.
[02:43:55.706 --> 02:44:01.507]  Well that's what I named the streams, because we named Facebook, YouTube, PrisonPlanet.tv streams for folks.
[02:44:01.507 --> 02:44:08.009]  And I said, you know, worst hurricane on record brings people together like never before.
[02:44:08.009 --> 02:44:17.011]  And why this is different, even though it's probably the worst ever, is because Trump got out of the way and just said FEMA's here to support the locals, let locals in.
[02:44:17.011 --> 02:44:18.671]  Instead, what happened with Katrina is
[02:44:20.566 --> 02:44:26.917]  Brownie wouldn't, the head of FEMA, doing a great job, Brownie, no he didn't, he wouldn't let people into hell, Zimmerman.
[02:44:28.089 --> 02:44:29.050]  Exactly.
[02:44:29.050 --> 02:44:30.530]  And they have sent FEMA out.
[02:44:30.530 --> 02:44:33.492]  I believe they're mainly more downtown right now.
[02:44:33.492 --> 02:44:42.036]  The convention center, they have a relief thing set up, and I'll try to get down there today or tomorrow, but currently the roads between where I'm at and there, I don't think I can get through.
[02:44:42.036 --> 02:44:52.162]  But I have not seen a ton of National Guard on the streets, but Houston's also very large, and that's why they called upon individuals to go out, you know, anyone with a boat, put that boat in the water, go rescue people from their homes.
[02:44:52.162 --> 02:44:56.384]  Because at this point, there's just simply not enough rescue workers out there.
[02:44:57.060 --> 02:45:04.442]  And all the sheriff's departments and police departments around here, they all have boats, but, and they're all working around the clock with those boats, but there's just too many people that needed saving.
[02:45:04.442 --> 02:45:06.603]  Sure, it's just like Dunkirk in World War II.
[02:45:06.603 --> 02:45:08.823]  The Citizen Navy saved 400,000 people.
[02:45:08.823 --> 02:45:09.904]  And let's expand on that.
[02:45:09.904 --> 02:45:17.666]  In the South, in the Southwest, whether you're black, white, or Hispanic, there is a background of your granddaddy worked in the fields, your dad probably did.
[02:45:18.286 --> 02:45:18.987]  To some extent.
[02:45:18.987 --> 02:45:20.568]  So you still like being outdoors.
[02:45:20.568 --> 02:45:22.989]  You like having a little boat you can go out on.
[02:45:22.989 --> 02:45:24.671]  You've got a guard in the backyard.
[02:45:24.671 --> 02:45:30.955]  So when a disaster comes, it's normal to get your little boat and go save people that need help because you're on higher ground, they're on lower ground.
[02:45:30.955 --> 02:45:35.558]  It's a normal instinct because if something happened to you, you hope folks are coming.
[02:45:35.558 --> 02:45:41.363]  It's not like you're a hero, but you look at places like New York, you know, doesn't matter whether they're white or black or Hispanic, they don't even know
[02:45:42.003 --> 02:45:44.465]  How to grow tomatoes on average, or do anything.
[02:45:44.465 --> 02:46:01.057]  Imagine a mega city like that, if they had a disaster or a war, how fast things would collapse in a Chicago, or in a New York, or in an LA, where any type of outdoorsmanship, which is just normal farmer backgrounds, is seen as weird, evil, quacky.
[02:46:01.057 --> 02:46:10.865]  I see articles all the time where Californians in Texas, all the time, every few weeks I see it in the news in Bastrop, or in Drippy Springs outside Austin, they'll drive by somebody's house that's on 50 acres,
[02:46:11.405 --> 02:46:11.986]  We're good to go.
[02:46:32.426 --> 02:46:33.606]  These people just don't get it.
[02:46:33.606 --> 02:46:39.728]  And there is this whole Southern culture of helping each other, too, which I don't think exists in those places.
[02:46:39.728 --> 02:46:41.468]  In California, places like L.A.
[02:46:41.468 --> 02:46:53.991]  or New York City, it's more like, I got mine, I don't care about anyone else, which, that's kind of a statement that doesn't fit everyone there, but for the most part, in places like Seattle that we went to, just how rude people are.
[02:46:53.991 --> 02:46:56.131]  Here in Texas, people hold the door for each other.
[02:46:56.871 --> 02:46:58.952]  And, uh, you know, they help each other in times of need.
[02:46:58.952 --> 02:47:04.913]  Women would laugh at me if I just instinctively was going through it, and so I'd go ahead and, yeah, leave the door open.
[02:47:04.913 --> 02:47:06.614]  It was, it's just a nastiness.
[02:47:06.614 --> 02:47:10.735]  Look at that, look at that sexist male holding the door open for a woman.
[02:47:10.735 --> 02:47:19.917]  That was a minority of folks, but let me tell you, the Canadians that worked on the oil rigs, worked on the ships, and the average folks were the super nice, just like you were in Texas or anywhere else.
[02:47:19.917 --> 02:47:24.579]  It was in the cities, all these freaked out, angry people.
[02:47:24.579 --> 02:47:25.339]  They're hateful people.
[02:47:26.121 --> 02:47:26.901]  They really are.
[02:47:26.901 --> 02:47:28.402]  I want to go back to Annette and then more calls.
[02:47:28.402 --> 02:47:29.423]  Stay there Zimmerman.
[02:47:29.423 --> 02:47:35.486]  Annette in Oklahoma, many other points for the folks that are watching and listening.
[02:47:35.486 --> 02:47:43.510]  I have to tell you, I visited A&M on Howdy Day, so I knew that there was no place else in the nation that I could go to school because that was the friendliest place on the planet.
[02:47:46.886 --> 02:47:56.259]  Governor Abbott called this mayor four times, and the mayor didn't answer the phone, he didn't respond to the messages, and he didn't call Governor Abbott back.
[02:47:56.259 --> 02:48:03.168]  So, these mayors have a fiduciary responsibility, and if they're not going to care for their constituents, then why do we have a mayor?
[02:48:03.849 --> 02:48:06.792]  If they're not going to have contingency plans, that's their job.
[02:48:06.792 --> 02:48:12.016]  And you're right, there's something about liberals, like you were saying Owen, it's a culture of I don't care.
[02:48:12.016 --> 02:48:14.358]  They get off on the dereliction of duty.
[02:48:14.358 --> 02:48:16.700]  Here's the governor calling all these cities, you need help?
[02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:20.503]  Tell them to get out of there, the low-lying areas, you're not running alerts, why not?
[02:48:20.503 --> 02:48:21.724]  Ah, shut up!
[02:48:21.724 --> 02:48:23.105]  You're nonsensical.
[02:48:23.105 --> 02:48:27.429]  That's fake news.
[02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:30.351]  Good point Annette, anything else?
[02:48:30.351 --> 02:48:31.913]  To shelter in place, that's deadly.
[02:48:32.947 --> 02:48:33.628]  No, you're right.
[02:48:33.628 --> 02:48:34.928]  You're telling people shelter in place?
[02:48:34.928 --> 02:48:35.269]  No.
[02:48:35.269 --> 02:48:38.111]  Get to high ground if you're in a low water area.
[02:48:38.111 --> 02:48:41.213]  These citizens in these counties are recommended to completely evacuate.
[02:48:41.213 --> 02:48:41.994]  NOAA weather.
[02:48:41.994 --> 02:48:45.196]  Since when do they not do the alerts?
[02:48:45.196 --> 02:48:50.320]  They have to be held responsible or this is going to keep happening and more people are going to die because they don't take their job seriously.
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:51.821]  Well, you know, Skousen got it right.
[02:48:51.821 --> 02:48:52.942]  It's the lawyers.
[02:48:52.942 --> 02:49:00.948]  They didn't want to have a position, but not having a position, it's kind of like the Rush song, you may choose not to choose, but not choosing, you still made a choice.
[02:49:02.715 --> 02:49:03.255]  But that's true.
[02:49:03.255 --> 02:49:10.260]  The lawyers are telling them, if you just wipe your hands of this, then the blood won't be on your hands.
[02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:11.721]  I think that's what Joel was saying.
[02:49:11.721 --> 02:49:17.045]  Hey, if you tell people to evacuate and then there's a panic and then people die, well, blood's on your hands.
[02:49:17.045 --> 02:49:21.127]  If you don't tell people anything and people die, well, you're okay.
[02:49:21.127 --> 02:49:21.688]  It's sick!
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:27.601]  And it all comes down really, though, again, to the average individual.
[02:49:27.601 --> 02:49:29.622]  And here's the average.
[02:49:29.622 --> 02:49:35.925]  The average individual, though, was listening to the authority figure waiting, and the authority figure just wanted the paycheck.
[02:49:35.925 --> 02:49:37.365]  They didn't want the authority.
[02:49:37.365 --> 02:49:42.167]  Because the authority means you're like Abbott on the phone, or Trump on the phone, or in the helicopters.
[02:49:42.167 --> 02:49:45.148]  It means you're actually going to have to go bust your butt.
[02:49:45.148 --> 02:49:46.069]  Zimmerman, other points?
[02:49:46.069 --> 02:49:46.569]  Thank you, Annette.
[02:49:46.569 --> 02:49:46.969]  Great points.
[02:49:47.919 --> 02:49:53.022]  Well, that was one of the points I was going to make, is that Abbott was not, you know, directing all this and orchestrating all this.
[02:49:53.022 --> 02:50:03.129]  From the governor's mansion here from Austin, he was actually at like a, one of these Ford Command Centers, where they're, you know, answering calls, coordinating, you know, what boats go where, what supplies go where.
[02:50:03.129 --> 02:50:04.030]  You know, Abbott was actually there.
[02:50:04.030 --> 02:50:05.671]  And that's why we're seeing a good response.
[02:50:05.671 --> 02:50:08.072]  That's why we're seeing a lot better response this time.
[02:50:08.072 --> 02:50:13.356]  And he was immediately on the phone with Trump, you know, getting this declared a disaster, you know, before the storm even hit.
[02:50:14.677 --> 02:50:19.061]  I really saw some good leadership there from Governor Abbott.
[02:50:19.061 --> 02:50:21.744]  Why are Democrats just institutionally incompetent?
[02:50:21.744 --> 02:50:22.965]  Because Bush did some bad stuff.
[02:50:22.965 --> 02:50:23.746]  We exposed it.
[02:50:23.746 --> 02:50:25.748]  These people are incompetent.
[02:50:25.748 --> 02:50:27.129]  They're afraid of their own shadow.
[02:50:27.129 --> 02:50:28.170]  They're afraid of everything.
[02:50:28.170 --> 02:50:29.211]  They're afraid of America.
[02:50:29.211 --> 02:50:30.272]  They're afraid of their own shadow.
[02:50:30.272 --> 02:50:31.613]  They're afraid of political correctness.
[02:50:31.613 --> 02:50:32.414]  They're afraid to say anything.
[02:50:32.414 --> 02:50:35.497]  The ACLU says, you know, we're sorry we tweeted out a picture of a white child.
[02:50:37.205 --> 02:50:38.728]  If that's not fear, I don't know what is.
[02:50:38.728 --> 02:50:40.110]  You know what I'm afraid of?
[02:50:40.110 --> 02:50:41.212]  Fostered system.
[02:50:41.212 --> 02:50:42.815]  Taking kids and giving them to Muslims.
[02:50:42.815 --> 02:50:43.917]  Which is now happening.
[02:50:43.917 --> 02:50:45.339]  We'll be right back with Michael Zimmerman.
[02:50:45.339 --> 02:50:48.525]  We're gonna go right to Joseph, Brad, and Sam and others.
[02:50:48.525 --> 02:50:48.905]  Stay with us.
[02:50:50.933 --> 02:50:52.614]  Do you trust our economy?
[02:50:52.614 --> 02:50:54.316]  How about our banking system?
[02:50:54.316 --> 02:51:01.501]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now, and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.
[02:51:01.501 --> 02:51:03.883]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now.

[02:52:52.332 --> 02:52:57.634]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:52:57.634 --> 02:52:59.234]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:52:59.234 --> 02:53:07.577]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:13.279]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:13.439 --> 02:53:15.260]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:15.260 --> 02:53:17.422]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:17.422 --> 02:53:21.945]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:21.945 --> 02:53:24.127]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:53:24.127 --> 02:53:32.053]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:54:13.879 --> 02:54:17.843]  You know, it's not hype to say we're under attack.
[02:54:17.843 --> 02:54:19.945]  In fact, it's the opposite of hype.
[02:54:19.945 --> 02:54:21.126]  We're under total attack.
[02:54:21.126 --> 02:54:27.431]  I'm not even going to watch the new daily show that kicks off where it's supposedly Alex Jones.
[02:54:27.431 --> 02:54:29.473]  They say, I am Alex Jones.
[02:54:29.473 --> 02:54:30.854]  That's the character.
[02:54:30.854 --> 02:54:33.216]  They say, this character is Alex Jones and I hate black people.
[02:54:33.216 --> 02:54:34.077]  Well, I didn't say that.
[02:54:34.077 --> 02:54:35.538]  They put that in the mouth.
[02:54:35.538 --> 02:54:36.719]  They'll even edit that out and play it.
[02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:39.821]  So, I guess it starts today.
[02:54:39.821 --> 02:54:42.222]  I mean, you thought Homeland was bad enough.
[02:54:42.222 --> 02:54:45.263]  Ladies and gentlemen, we need your financial support.
[02:54:45.263 --> 02:54:51.105]  We've got great supplements, great products, great water filtration, great air purification.
[02:54:51.105 --> 02:54:53.466]  Sometimes our screw-ups are good.
[02:54:53.466 --> 02:54:57.468]  We're supposed to end that sale of the Alexa Pure Breezes for $149 at $220.
[02:54:57.468 --> 02:54:59.489]  They're like the best system out there.
[02:54:59.489 --> 02:55:02.090]  Four-stage filter, ion filter, carbon, you name it.
[02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:02.910]  They're still $149.
[02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:04.731]  That sale's still up there.
[02:55:04.731 --> 02:55:05.311]  Not supposed to be.
[02:55:05.311 --> 02:55:06.472]  I'm not mad at the folks that left it up.
[02:55:07.552 --> 02:55:08.934]  Still up there, I was told.
[02:55:08.934 --> 02:55:11.156]  That's going to have to end soon.
[02:55:11.156 --> 02:55:13.999]  We have 57% off Super Metal Vitality.
[02:55:13.999 --> 02:55:16.041]  We've never done that.
[02:55:16.041 --> 02:55:18.604]  We've got 45% off on the X2.
[02:55:18.604 --> 02:55:19.785]  Everybody should try that.
[02:55:19.785 --> 02:55:21.968]  But whatever you do, commit today to support the broadcast.
[02:55:21.968 --> 02:55:22.809]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[02:55:23.049 --> 02:55:25.090]  So you know you're supporting us and don't forget to do it.
[02:55:25.090 --> 02:55:26.211]  Additional 10% off.
[02:55:26.211 --> 02:55:28.052]  Just take action and fund us.
[02:55:28.052 --> 02:55:35.257]  And if you think I've been dominating with my crew, the globalists, I will savagely attack them with information warfare 10 times harder.
[02:55:35.257 --> 02:55:36.758]  And we have the funds to do it.
[02:55:36.758 --> 02:55:38.439]  Now, he was trying to go during the break.
[02:55:38.439 --> 02:55:39.320]  The water's rising.
[02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:40.280]  This is not a stunt.
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:44.003]  He'll be back in 30 minutes when he gets to higher ground, even though he's in my old Ford F1.
[02:55:44.363 --> 02:55:44.463]  Sure.
[02:55:44.463 --> 02:55:46.545]  So we have this, here's the Braes Bayou right here.
[02:55:46.545 --> 02:55:49.807]  And there were some vehicles here, they were measuring the speed of the water.
[02:55:49.807 --> 02:55:52.189]  Then there were also some people in the intersection back behind me.
[02:56:06.724 --> 02:56:08.687]  And all those cars have pulled out at this point.
[02:56:08.687 --> 02:56:12.232]  It's continued to rain so the water is rising in the street a little bit.
[02:56:12.232 --> 02:56:17.880]  And I'm about as far forward as I can get before in every single direction you have flooded streets.
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:19.222]  So this is kind of a dead end here.
[02:56:19.222 --> 02:56:22.908]  So you are to the edge of what Drudge is calling the Gulf of Houston.
[02:56:24.065 --> 02:56:24.645]  One of them.
[02:56:24.645 --> 02:56:29.107]  Because there's many other areas in town, these little pockets, these neighborhoods, that are flooded out.
[02:56:29.107 --> 02:56:30.908]  There's entire freeways that are flooded.
[02:56:30.908 --> 02:56:35.089]  I've got a video up on the Alex Jones Channel about that.
[02:56:35.089 --> 02:56:42.372]  One of the largest freeways in the country, Interstate 10, is completely underwater in spots where it goes through Houston.
[02:56:42.372 --> 02:56:45.594]  So, I'm going to relocate to a different area in case these roads flood.
[02:56:45.594 --> 02:56:48.475]  Otherwise, I'll be kind of trapped in this one spot here at the end.
[02:56:48.475 --> 02:56:51.256]  But, I'll be rejoining with David Knight.
[02:56:51.997 --> 02:56:52.919]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:56:52.919 --> 02:56:55.804]  And David's got... I asked David, he's out there getting ready to come in.
[02:56:55.804 --> 02:56:57.387]  I said, I'm gonna take some calls and he said, come on.
[02:56:57.387 --> 02:56:58.749]  I said, what are you gonna be covering?
[02:56:58.749 --> 02:57:01.835]  He goes, I'm gonna be covering Tillerson running the president down on Fox.
[02:57:01.835 --> 02:57:03.718]  I meant to lead the show with that.
[02:57:03.718 --> 02:57:04.700]  I didn't even get...
[02:57:06.038 --> 02:57:10.021]  To the small children up to like age 10 being taken from their parents.
[02:57:10.021 --> 02:57:12.082]  Crosses are ripped off.
[02:57:12.082 --> 02:57:14.504]  They're told Christianity is BS.
[02:57:14.504 --> 02:57:16.325]  Burkas are stuck on their heads.
[02:57:16.325 --> 02:57:18.186]  And the leftists go, this is enrichment.
[02:57:18.186 --> 02:57:21.348]  The most satanic violations of people's faith.
[02:57:21.348 --> 02:57:24.490]  The most cruel human rights violations.
[02:57:24.490 --> 02:57:28.413]  And the left, this is in England, where in a lot of these things they sexualize the kids.
[02:57:28.413 --> 02:57:29.334]  That's been confirmed.
[02:57:29.334 --> 02:57:32.436]  I mean, the left literally hates Christians.
[02:57:32.436 --> 02:57:34.137]  And we have to get that in our head to understand.
[02:57:34.137 --> 02:57:35.358]  They know what they're doing.
[02:57:36.238 --> 02:57:39.660]  Now, a lot of well-meaning ones are just like Stockholm Syndrome, beating into it.
[02:57:39.660 --> 02:57:43.121]  Well, they're Muslims and, you know, they deserve to have foster kids, too.
[02:57:43.121 --> 02:57:45.943]  And you don't take Muslim kids and give them to Christians.
[02:57:45.943 --> 02:57:48.524]  You wouldn't take atheist kids and give them to Christians.
[02:57:48.524 --> 02:57:53.006]  You see CPS more and more taking people's kids in liberal areas because their parents are Christians.
[02:57:53.006 --> 02:57:55.127]  I'm sick of the persecution!
[02:57:55.127 --> 02:57:55.947]  Yeah, you didn't get to that.
[02:57:55.947 --> 02:58:00.329]  You didn't even get to Antifa just beating people savagely over the weekend.
[02:58:00.329 --> 02:58:04.071]  I mean, it's just, this is crazy state of the nation we're in right now, Alex.
[02:58:05.518 --> 02:58:07.579]  Just savagely beating people.
[02:58:07.579 --> 02:58:09.439]  And the police stood down because they deserve it.
[02:58:09.439 --> 02:58:18.842]  Because if a prayer group comes and tries to, you know, have a prayer, they deserve to be beaten with clubs over the head by mobs of people and the police stand down because, well, they're Nazis.
[02:58:18.842 --> 02:58:20.123]  Antifa said they were.
[02:58:20.823 --> 02:58:26.785]  I mean just mobs of people beating up saying you don't have demonstrations in America.
[02:58:26.785 --> 02:58:27.665]  My God.
[02:58:27.665 --> 02:58:28.845]  Fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:58:28.845 --> 02:58:30.565]  Please spread the InfoWars.
[02:58:30.565 --> 02:58:31.666]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:31.666 --> 02:58:32.886]  NewsWars.com.
[02:58:32.886 --> 02:58:34.806]  You are the power of InfoWars.
[02:58:34.806 --> 02:58:36.087]  We're going in.
[02:58:36.087 --> 02:58:38.267]  But we need you to put the wind in our sails.
[02:58:38.267 --> 02:58:39.648]  Fourth hour coming up.
[02:58:39.648 --> 02:58:40.328]  Phone call straight ahead.
[02:58:42.090 --> 02:58:48.614]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:58:48.614 --> 02:59:01.402]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, a bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:59:01.602 --> 02:59:05.264]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:59:05.264 --> 02:59:12.227]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:59:12.227 --> 02:59:25.093]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:59:25.093 --> 02:59:26.654]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:59:26.954 --> 02:59:33.341]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:59:33.341 --> 02:59:37.526]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:59:37.526 --> 02:59:39.087]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:50.419 --> 02:59:52.282]  We are on the march.
[02:59:52.282 --> 02:59:55.447]  The empire is on the run.
[02:59:55.447 --> 02:59:59.154]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:01.331 --> 03:00:05.773]  Facebook is announcing that all pro-America Christian information will be banned.
[03:00:05.773 --> 03:00:06.954]  They're calling it fake news.
[03:00:06.954 --> 03:00:08.054]  That's the hill.
[03:00:08.054 --> 03:00:10.155]  This is why racketeering lawsuits are needed.
[03:00:10.155 --> 03:00:15.478]  It's why you've got to hand-share articles from NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com yourself.
[03:00:15.478 --> 03:00:16.839]  The war is only intensifying.
[03:00:16.839 --> 03:00:18.960]  We're beginning to win, but the enemy's panicking.
[03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:21.101]  Joseph in Dallas, thanks for holding.
[03:00:21.101 --> 03:00:22.481]  We'll go to Sam and others.
[03:00:22.481 --> 03:00:22.761]  Go ahead.
[03:00:22.761 --> 03:00:23.542]  You're on the air, Joseph.
[03:00:24.298 --> 03:00:33.622]  Yes, I want to publicly rebuke Joel Osteen with his massive megachurch shrine that's just sitting there open.
[03:00:33.622 --> 03:00:38.624]  Osteen, get off your $25 million house, get down there, start helping people.
[03:00:38.624 --> 03:00:42.125]  We've got 500,000 people sick and injured all around the country.
[03:00:42.125 --> 03:00:43.666]  I mean, is Osteen not helping people?
[03:00:43.666 --> 03:00:49.248]  Maybe he'll just positively, he'll be positive like Oprah with a secret, and then they'll all just be given houses.
[03:00:49.248 --> 03:00:50.089]  They don't need the church.
[03:00:51.363 --> 03:00:52.183]  It's a joke!
[03:00:52.183 --> 03:00:53.344]  We're tired of them!
[03:00:53.344 --> 03:00:54.004]  And you know what?
[03:00:54.004 --> 03:00:56.785]  Gary Cohen, you went into Fort Knox.
[03:00:56.785 --> 03:00:58.266]  We know there's no gold there.
[03:00:58.266 --> 03:01:01.187]  President Trump, fire the generals!
[03:01:01.187 --> 03:01:02.527]  Fire Cohen!
[03:01:02.527 --> 03:01:04.868]  Bring in Dr. Steve Pucinich!
[03:01:04.868 --> 03:01:06.869]  Okay, okay, Joseph, I understand you're mad.
[03:01:06.869 --> 03:01:14.091]  Specifically, is Joel Osteen's megachurch, I guess that's on higher ground, is that being used as a refugee center?
[03:01:14.091 --> 03:01:14.892]  It should be.
[03:01:14.892 --> 03:01:15.912]  It's a massive complex.
[03:01:16.152 --> 03:01:17.213]  Absolutely not.
[03:01:17.213 --> 03:01:18.233]  Absolutely not.
[03:01:18.233 --> 03:01:19.074]  He's a joke.
[03:01:19.074 --> 03:01:20.414]  He's totally for himself.
[03:01:20.414 --> 03:01:21.975]  His stupid smile is a joke.
[03:01:21.975 --> 03:01:24.077]  We see him with his massive book deals.
[03:01:24.077 --> 03:01:24.937]  It's a joke.
[03:01:24.937 --> 03:01:27.098]  Be like Jesus Zolstein.
[03:01:27.098 --> 03:01:28.899]  You want to see a real prophet?
[03:01:28.899 --> 03:01:31.801]  Go to Shekinah River Ministries.
[03:01:31.801 --> 03:01:32.702]  Facebook.
[03:01:32.702 --> 03:01:34.222]  S-H-E-K-I-N-G.
[03:01:34.222 --> 03:01:38.805]  But the Lord said give me all the money and then it'll be good and magic.
[03:01:38.805 --> 03:01:44.909]  Look, you know, in a way, I like the positive thinking overall because being positive will get people out of their we're victimhood.
[03:01:45.729 --> 03:01:53.576]  So, I'm kind of mixed on Olsteen because, you know, he is getting people to be positive.
[03:01:53.576 --> 03:01:59.882]  I don't like the part about that he magically, you know, this is all going to happen for you.
[03:01:59.882 --> 03:02:03.705]  What did Joel Olsteen say about the hurricane response?
[03:02:03.705 --> 03:02:04.146]  Nothing.
[03:02:04.146 --> 03:02:06.568]  He's hiding in his massive compound.
[03:02:06.568 --> 03:02:07.849]  Well, I don't know.
[03:02:07.849 --> 03:02:09.230]  The heavy reports he did say something.
[03:02:09.230 --> 03:02:10.331]  I appreciate your call, Joseph.
[03:02:10.331 --> 03:02:11.853]  Can we scroll down and see what he actually said?
[03:02:13.786 --> 03:02:17.367]  Victoria and I are praying for everyone affected by the Hurricane Harvey.
[03:02:17.367 --> 03:02:22.127]  Please join us as we pray for the safety of our Texas friends and family.
[03:02:22.127 --> 03:02:23.668]  Give people grace to change.
[03:02:23.668 --> 03:02:26.408]  Don't judge their whole life for one season, one mistake.
[03:02:26.408 --> 03:02:28.348]  There's a simple phrase.
[03:02:28.348 --> 03:02:30.129]  You have to get down in your spirit.
[03:02:30.129 --> 03:02:31.429]  God's got it.
[03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:35.110]  So there's nothing about getting the church to go out and volunteer with people?
[03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:36.210]  That's not a good idea.
[03:02:36.210 --> 03:02:38.650]  I was already trying to get names of churches we can give to.
[03:02:38.650 --> 03:02:41.131]  Jesus promises peace through passing understanding.
[03:02:41.131 --> 03:02:42.591]  That peace when it doesn't make sense.
[03:02:43.476 --> 03:02:48.938]  Well, it doesn't make sense for Joel Osteen to not be saying his church is going to be a refugee emergency center.
[03:02:48.938 --> 03:02:51.239]  Well, his complex in Houston is massive.
[03:02:51.239 --> 03:02:54.040]  It's right off one of the major interstates there.
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:03:00.243]  Zimmerman, being from Houston, he would obviously have better details on that when he comes on with David Knight later to tell you if it's flooded or not.
[03:03:00.243 --> 03:03:03.164]  I don't know if Joseph knows if it's flooded or not.
[03:03:03.164 --> 03:03:07.105]  But that makes sense if they're trying to get people to hire ground.
[03:03:07.105 --> 03:03:08.746]  But his complex is massive.
[03:03:08.746 --> 03:03:10.427]  I mean, is it above water?
[03:03:11.207 --> 03:03:18.193]  Well, even if the water was 25 feet, I mean, it's like a four-story complex, but I don't know what the situation is that is complex.
[03:03:18.193 --> 03:03:19.414]  There it is!
[03:03:19.414 --> 03:03:22.456]  Oh no, it says, will you be opening up your church to victims of Hurricane Harvey?
[03:03:22.456 --> 03:03:24.198]  I guess people are asking.
[03:03:24.198 --> 03:03:27.621]  Yeah, so I'm assuming he's just not responded to anybody on that.
[03:03:29.793 --> 03:03:32.093]  So, I don't know if his complex is underwater or not.
[03:03:32.093 --> 03:03:34.514]  That's why I love callers, because the caller didn't say anything about that.
[03:03:34.514 --> 03:03:36.094]  He said, part of rescue efforts.
[03:03:36.094 --> 03:03:38.495]  I don't screen calls, but he brought up a good point.
[03:03:38.495 --> 03:03:39.175]  Joel Osteen.
[03:03:39.175 --> 03:03:41.235]  I was just reading one of his books last week.
[03:03:41.235 --> 03:03:45.836]  I said, you know, I'm not just going to say bad things about the guy, which I really haven't, but I know it's name and climate stuff.
[03:03:45.836 --> 03:03:46.896]  And I said, let me actually read it.
[03:03:46.896 --> 03:03:49.137]  And I got partly through it.
[03:03:49.137 --> 03:03:54.098]  Yeah, Osteen has not tweeted yet today, nor has he responded to harsh criticism that he has received.
[03:03:54.098 --> 03:03:56.278]  So, you know, there's the name of this segment.
[03:03:57.236 --> 03:04:03.802]  Will Joel Osteen open up his megachurch for people flooded in Houston is the tweet.
[03:04:03.802 --> 03:04:08.426]  Well, he'll say just magically pray and a floating city in the sky will appear and float down.
[03:04:08.426 --> 03:04:18.454]  No, God gave his father and then him the providence and the responsibility and the stewardship to at least talk to local government and others and see if he's high and dry.
[03:04:19.315 --> 03:04:23.157]  To be able to then use that as a staging center or a place to help people.
[03:04:23.157 --> 03:04:25.277]  Which is what you always use churches in a hurricane.
[03:04:25.277 --> 03:04:29.839]  Yeah, especially with Osteen who has a huge... I mean, he's got a huge following.
[03:04:29.839 --> 03:04:31.020]  He could have major impact.
[03:04:31.020 --> 03:04:33.481]  But they might track mud in on the floor.
[03:04:33.481 --> 03:04:34.761]  Oh, he's got new carpets.
[03:04:34.761 --> 03:04:37.042]  And then that would cut in on the little glitter bug things.
[03:04:37.042 --> 03:04:40.743]  I'm the perfect person, and so's my wife.
[03:04:40.743 --> 03:04:44.005]  And if you just imagine everything's fine, it'll be good.
[03:04:52.813 --> 03:04:59.635]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[03:04:59.635 --> 03:05:02.196]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[03:05:02.196 --> 03:05:05.657]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[03:05:05.657 --> 03:05:07.838]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[03:05:07.838 --> 03:05:12.680]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[03:05:12.680 --> 03:05:15.561]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[03:05:15.561 --> 03:05:19.762]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[03:05:22.643 --> 03:05:23.564]  Unprecedented.
[03:05:23.564 --> 03:05:24.784]  And it's cold-pressed.
[03:05:24.784 --> 03:05:26.725]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[03:05:26.725 --> 03:05:33.068]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science and these are other... What you sell, BuzzFeed said, is already best-selling stuff.
[03:05:33.068 --> 03:05:35.129]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[03:05:35.129 --> 03:05:36.330]  Why, these aren't anything new.
[03:05:36.330 --> 03:05:40.592]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[03:05:40.592 --> 03:05:40.992]  Duh!
[03:05:40.992 --> 03:05:41.052]  Duh!

[03:07:53.508 --> 03:07:55.009]  Answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:07:55.009 --> 03:08:07.156]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.156 --> 03:08:16.201]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got some of the most devastatingly insane news we've ever covered.
[03:08:16.201 --> 03:08:18.083]  For weeks there was a conservative
[03:08:18.905 --> 03:08:28.628]  Patriot prayer meeting set for San Francisco outside Berkeley that was supposed to be about unison, coming together, and loving God.
[03:08:28.628 --> 03:08:34.931]  And Nancy Pelosi has announced she's very pleased that it got shut down over the weekend.
[03:08:34.931 --> 03:08:37.071]  The mayor has said they're very pleased.
[03:08:37.071 --> 03:08:38.732]  These are really evil people.
[03:08:41.187 --> 03:08:45.889]  I've been watching the footage today, and it is mind-blowing.
[03:08:45.889 --> 03:08:52.933]  I was watching some of the show this morning when David Knight, who hosts his own transmission, The Real News, with David Knight, 8 a.m.
[03:08:52.933 --> 03:08:53.593]  to 11 a.m.
[03:08:53.593 --> 03:09:04.919]  Central, syndicated radio, TV, right before I'm on, and he was covering all this, but I'd missed the part where Pelosi, the Congresswoman for the area, and
[03:09:05.979 --> 03:09:09.322]  The mayor of San Francisco praised the footage.
[03:09:09.322 --> 03:09:22.392]  Now, it's hard for me to watch this footage, but if you're a radio listener, it's Christians being chased down and beaten with clubs and with bike locks, basically maces, and hospitalized and just
[03:09:23.212 --> 03:09:27.173]  Meth heads in black, basically beating the living hell out of them.
[03:09:27.173 --> 03:09:35.376]  And then I've got the Daily Mail, the Times of London, Christian child forced into Muslim foster care.
[03:09:35.376 --> 03:09:40.217]  Five-year-old girl, native Britain, speaks English.
[03:09:40.217 --> 03:09:41.738]  The Muslims wear burqas.
[03:09:42.338 --> 03:09:58.411]  The CPS workers are Muslims, they take you, they bring you to Muslims, they rip her chain off, they tell you Christ isn't real, and that the UK is going to fall to Islam, and they put a burqa on their head, and then the girl begs the other social workers who are Muslims and they laugh at her.
[03:09:58.411 --> 03:10:02.254]  This is mainstream news, so it's anti-Christian, so you have to understand.
[03:10:03.868 --> 03:10:18.523]  They sit there, and when some ne'er-do-well, probably a Democrat, led by former Democrats, Obama folks with Black Lives Matter and with Occupy, leading the white supremacist group, one person runs over a poor young woman.
[03:10:18.523 --> 03:10:22.087]  And they project that onto all libertarians, all conservatives, all Christians.
[03:10:22.087 --> 03:10:24.930]  CNN says all Trump voters are white supremacists.
[03:10:25.390 --> 03:10:35.396]  So then a Christian group goes out to have a prayer rally and they are beaten and the police stand down savagely and viciously trying to ignite a civil war.
[03:10:35.396 --> 03:10:41.899]  Let's roll some of that footage with audio from the helicopter and from buildings that you guys were playing last segment.
[03:10:41.899 --> 03:10:44.261]  I want to roll some of this footage here.
[03:10:45.908 --> 03:11:01.244]  And again, there's no audio on this particular one, and they are just beating people, ganging up, men and women, ganging up on lone individuals, and just beating them in a wanton, savage, brown shirt, Nazi operation.
[03:11:01.244 --> 03:11:02.105]  You talk about Nazi.
[03:11:02.705 --> 03:11:16.818]  Having the SPLC that's got a bunch of lawsuits filed against it by mainline Christian groups, having them banned off Amazon, having them banned from commerce with blacklists beyond any communist blacklists of the 50s where you can't write in Hollywood as a screenwriter.
[03:11:16.818 --> 03:11:19.801]  We're talking about banned from commerce, banned from Amazon.
[03:11:19.801 --> 03:11:21.002]  Next it'll be...
[03:11:22.023 --> 03:11:23.183]  Ban from you name it.
[03:11:23.183 --> 03:11:23.443]  U.S.
[03:11:23.443 --> 03:11:29.585]  Representative Nancy Pelosi, a fellow Democrat, represents San Francisco, called the planned rally a white supremacist event.
[03:11:29.585 --> 03:11:30.685]  A conservative prayer rally.
[03:11:30.685 --> 03:11:39.246]  So all conservative, libertarian, or pro-American speech is now hate, and you deserve to be attacked.
[03:11:39.246 --> 03:11:46.248]  People dressed like Captain America, people dressed like Che Guevara, people dressed in Star Wars rebel outfits.
[03:11:46.248 --> 03:11:46.728]  Again, they have
[03:11:48.270 --> 03:11:50.131]  Real-life action drama.
[03:11:50.131 --> 03:11:51.592]  LARPers, I guess you call them.
[03:11:51.592 --> 03:11:56.074]  They now don't go to fields to fight with each other with rubber sticks and swords.
[03:11:56.074 --> 03:12:00.777]  They take real sticks and they beat you almost to death or to death.
[03:12:00.777 --> 03:12:06.400]  So the LARPers, the live-action gaming folks, now have a target.
[03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:11.723]  They pour urine on people, feces, and the conservatives take it.
[03:12:11.723 --> 03:12:12.964]  And then they kick them to the ground.
[03:12:13.979 --> 03:12:17.903]  And then savagely beat them.
[03:12:17.903 --> 03:12:19.404]  And wearing masks.
[03:12:19.404 --> 03:12:22.027]  And it's white guys screaming, F you white male!
[03:12:22.027 --> 03:12:23.408]  F you, F you Nazi!
[03:12:23.408 --> 03:12:25.870]  Because most of them, I guess, were brought up racist or whatever.
[03:12:25.870 --> 03:12:28.032]  So this is their great coming of age, attacking people.
[03:12:28.032 --> 03:12:29.614]  I've got three more calls and I'm taking them.
[03:12:29.614 --> 03:12:33.097]  Turn over to David Knight, who's already done Yeoman's work today, hosting three hours.
[03:12:33.097 --> 03:12:34.078]  David, this is incredible.
[03:12:34.138 --> 03:12:39.625]  You know, one thing I want to say, Alex, is that the mayor of San Francisco, his name is Ed Lee.
[03:12:39.625 --> 03:12:41.668]  Now, that's a racist name if I've ever seen one.
[03:12:41.668 --> 03:12:46.655]  His last name is Lee, and his first initial is E. This guy should be removed from office.
[03:12:46.655 --> 03:12:49.118]  Well, ESPN is removing Asians with the name Lee.
[03:12:49.318 --> 03:13:11.852]  As I was referring to, yeah, Robert Lee, they said, actually, it was, I think it was Reuters or the Associated Press that came out and said, had two tweets about Robert Lee, the broadcaster for ESPN being removed from the University of Virginia football game broadcast, and they said, his namesake, Robert E. Lee, and then they went in the second tweet, they said he was the doppelganger of Robert E. Lee.
[03:13:11.852 --> 03:13:13.713]  No, he's Asian, he's a young Asian guy.
[03:13:13.713 --> 03:13:16.455]  So anyway, this mayor... Yeah, Robert's common, Lee's common?
[03:13:16.775 --> 03:13:18.836]  Yeah, it's one of the most common Asian names you can find.
[03:13:18.836 --> 03:13:22.817]  So now if anybody's named Jones, they always say, I'm Jim Jones because of Jim Jones.
[03:13:22.817 --> 03:13:24.117]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:13:24.117 --> 03:13:25.397]  So this is the insanity.
[03:13:25.397 --> 03:13:31.439]  And of course Lynch, we've had multiple buildings have the name Lynch removed from them because that could cause people distress.
[03:13:31.439 --> 03:13:34.740]  I guess we should have used that to remove Loretta Lynch from the Obama administration.
[03:13:34.740 --> 03:13:39.501]  They're taking down Martin Luther King statues and murals because he didn't talk about trannies.
[03:13:39.501 --> 03:13:41.641]  It's insane!
[03:13:41.641 --> 03:13:43.662]  It's like if you didn't talk about something, you're bad.
[03:13:44.082 --> 03:13:47.605]  Well, let me tell you what Ed Lee, the mayor of San Francisco, said.
[03:13:47.605 --> 03:13:53.611]  You just saw those videos of them chasing and beating people, people in black clothing, black masks.
[03:13:53.611 --> 03:13:57.234]  Over a hundred of them broke through the lines and attacked stragglers who were there.
[03:13:57.234 --> 03:13:59.716]  For the most part, the event was shut down.
[03:13:59.716 --> 03:14:03.840]  They couldn't find enough conservatives, so they started attacking the police after a while.
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:08.705]  But you saw them beating the conservatives, even as they come in, carrying no hate signs.
[03:14:08.705 --> 03:14:09.726]  And the mayor said,
[03:14:10.146 --> 03:14:16.233]  They made sure the themes of love and compassion dominated over hate speech.
[03:14:16.233 --> 03:14:17.334]  What lies?
[03:14:17.334 --> 03:14:20.698]  And this is as Facebook announces we're gonna be banned.
[03:14:20.698 --> 03:14:21.579]  This is out today.
[03:14:21.579 --> 03:14:25.824]  They're gonna block basically all conservative, all libertarian, all pro-Trump news.
[03:14:25.824 --> 03:14:28.087]  They say if third-party groups list it,
[03:14:28.747 --> 03:14:36.310]  It says Facebook is blocking pages that post fake news stories from buying ads as part of its efforts to curb hoax articles on its platform.
[03:14:36.310 --> 03:14:42.353]  The company announced on Monday it would prevent Facebook pages public... See what happens is, if you don't buy some ads on Facebook, they don't let you spread your stuff.
[03:14:43.342 --> 03:14:57.199]  The company announced on Monday they'll prevent Facebook pages, public profiles and brands, celebrity groups, businesses and other institutions that repeatedly share news marked as false by the SPLC that runs it, by third-party fact-checkers from advertising on its platform.
[03:14:57.199 --> 03:14:58.120]  And then it just goes on.
[03:14:58.120 --> 03:15:00.103]  The crackdown, the total takeover is here.
[03:15:00.103 --> 03:15:00.864]  We've got a false suit.
[03:15:01.084 --> 03:15:16.797]  Alex, we just celebrated our one-week anniversary of Real News, and in that time, today I just learned that YouTube has age-restricted my video, talking about the fact that talking to kindergartners about transgender issues should be age-restricted.
[03:15:17.037 --> 03:15:22.180]  I said, this is a, the title of the video was Pedophile Government Grooms Kindergarteners.
[03:15:22.180 --> 03:15:29.104]  Because what they're doing is trying to pretend that these kindergartners who were alarmed by this... Yeah, they're sexualizing children.
[03:15:29.104 --> 03:15:33.267]  Imagine if a man or woman walked up and talked to your five-year-old at a park about sex.
[03:15:33.267 --> 03:15:35.808]  It would be absolutely an arrestable offense.
[03:15:35.808 --> 03:15:36.169]  Yes.
[03:15:36.169 --> 03:15:40.211]  But oh, if it's done in the name of openness, that's how sick this is.
[03:15:40.211 --> 03:15:43.153]  And hey, Ron Paul is having his channel banned.
[03:15:43.153 --> 03:15:44.113]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:15:44.113 --> 03:15:44.774]  That's been announced.
[03:15:45.094 --> 03:15:48.157]  So the irony is, is that when I talk about the fact... That's hate, by the way!
[03:15:48.157 --> 03:15:54.021]  Yeah, when I talk about the fact that you should not be talking about this to kindergartners because it's not age-appropriate.
[03:15:54.021 --> 03:15:57.845]  They age-restricted my video, even though there's nothing in there that goes even above a year.
[03:15:57.845 --> 03:16:05.851]  But don't they understand that we're not going to be intimidated, and it's going to make us work harder, and our listeners are going to support us, and we've got a lot of affiliates getting ready to pick up your show.
[03:16:05.851 --> 03:16:09.974]  That's why I got it for close to the end of the year, because they usually have a contract.
[03:16:09.974 --> 03:16:12.637]  So most contracts with Clear Channel and others are a year.
[03:16:13.217 --> 03:16:26.887]  So, we're getting, our Affiliate Relations guy told me he's had more than 70 of my 200 plus affiliates say, we like David Knight, we like what we hear, send us more, give us more info.
[03:16:26.887 --> 03:16:27.948]  We're looking at picking it up.
[03:16:27.948 --> 03:16:31.711]  So, usually people have a show for years locally before it gets syndicated.
[03:16:31.711 --> 03:16:33.912]  Out of the Gates is what you've done here and everywhere else.
[03:16:33.912 --> 03:16:39.977]  We have got close to 70 stations saying, we're seriously looking at picking up David Knight.
[03:16:39.977 --> 03:16:41.538]  So, very, very exciting.
[03:16:41.578 --> 03:16:42.158]  That's great.
[03:16:42.158 --> 03:16:43.499]  I'm excited about that.
[03:16:43.499 --> 03:16:49.543]  And when you're talking about Ron Paul, Julian Assange tweeted this out and he said, this is economic censorship.
[03:16:49.543 --> 03:16:52.205]  And that's precisely what is happening with the big tech companies.
[03:16:52.205 --> 03:16:53.886]  Nobody's more genteel.
[03:16:53.886 --> 03:16:55.347]  No one is less hateful.
[03:16:55.347 --> 03:16:56.548]  No one is more on target.
[03:16:56.548 --> 03:16:58.329]  No one is more Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[03:16:58.329 --> 03:17:02.412]  So Obi-Wan Kenobi isn't allowed to have a YouTube channel.
[03:17:02.412 --> 03:17:03.713]  That's where you people have gone.
[03:17:04.013 --> 03:17:05.895]  Yeah, it's absolutely insane, isn't it?
[03:17:05.895 --> 03:17:12.841]  And then in the meantime, we've got people like Zuckerberg at Facebook dropping hints that he may be running for political office.
[03:17:12.841 --> 03:17:19.667]  We've got Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Computer, is making the rounds in Iowa and Ohio talking about
[03:17:20.247 --> 03:17:28.973]  Yeah, now the new media magnates are going to become not just the kings of their billion-person armies, but now over you, and they're going to censor you politically.
[03:17:28.973 --> 03:17:31.635]  Used to you couldn't own your own media empire and run for office.
[03:17:31.635 --> 03:17:45.724]  Now they're saying, we own our own multimedia empires, and we're not going to let you have any speech on the soapbox, and then we're going to game it, and we're going to break down the borders and bring in the third-world populations and take full control while we're tax-exempt and cause race and social war.
[03:17:45.724 --> 03:17:47.506]  I want to go to Brad in HB, the other caller.
[03:17:52.007 --> 03:18:10.292]  I'm sorry you have to endure this national disaster, but I'd be remiss to fail to remind everyone in your area, being from Louisiana and haven't been through these things, that it's not over yet.
[03:18:11.110 --> 03:18:17.074]  And still be on the lookout for more rain and this thing to come back.
[03:18:17.074 --> 03:18:23.799]  And as you do, you will notice that the people who are demonized to the greatest extent
[03:18:25.472 --> 03:18:39.477]  Christians will be those people who show up and who will be there to feed, clothe, and house everyone and minister to them emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually.
[03:18:39.477 --> 03:18:41.177]  Well, it's like David was saying earlier during the break.
[03:18:41.177 --> 03:18:42.418]  You didn't hear him because he wasn't on air.
[03:18:43.427 --> 03:18:47.730]  Yeah, people criticizing Olsteen for not offering food or saying, use my church, whatever.
[03:18:47.730 --> 03:18:52.975]  It will be the little churches everywhere with the people just showing up with the food and actually feeding even the cops.
[03:18:52.975 --> 03:18:53.415]  Go ahead.
[03:18:53.415 --> 03:18:54.636]  That's what we saw in North Carolina.
[03:18:54.636 --> 03:18:58.299]  As a matter of fact, one of my sons won a U.S.
[03:18:58.299 --> 03:19:04.304]  and Canadian contest by talking about the difference between two responses to disasters in North Carolina.
[03:19:04.304 --> 03:19:08.187]  One of them was a major event on the coast and FEMA got involved.
[03:19:08.567 --> 03:19:11.732]  Very heavy-handed, and a lot of people were suffering with that.
[03:19:11.732 --> 03:19:18.461]  On the other hand, close to where we live, there was a tornado that devastated several communities, but it wasn't big enough to get the federal government involved.
[03:19:18.461 --> 03:19:22.086]  What happened there was churches opened up their parking lot.
[03:19:22.086 --> 03:19:23.969]  Oh, and back then Obama didn't help people.
[03:19:24.329 --> 03:19:25.930]  That's right.
[03:19:25.930 --> 03:19:33.196]  Massive amounts of food to these church parking lots and they distributed to people all of this voluntary, none of it coordinated by government.
[03:19:33.196 --> 03:19:39.161]  Government's only involvement there was for the police to go in and cordon off areas where power lines had gone down.
[03:19:39.161 --> 03:19:41.003]  That's the appropriate... And that's what they're supposed to do.
[03:19:41.003 --> 03:19:43.445]  Let me just say, Austin got hit by high winds.
[03:19:44.505 --> 03:19:46.466]  Rob Dewey had a big tree in front of his house.
[03:19:46.466 --> 03:19:48.707]  They were there in one hour cutting it up.
[03:19:48.707 --> 03:19:49.607]  Power lines down.
[03:19:49.607 --> 03:19:50.868]  Cops there in five minutes.
[03:19:50.868 --> 03:19:52.529]  Firefighters in 20.
[03:19:52.529 --> 03:19:53.649]  Working.
[03:19:53.649 --> 03:19:55.510]  And we haven't been hit that hard.
[03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:56.390]  40 hours straight.
[03:19:56.390 --> 03:19:57.931]  That's good services.
[03:19:57.931 --> 03:19:59.092]  That's hard work.
[03:19:59.092 --> 03:20:01.113]  Risking their lives.
[03:20:01.113 --> 03:20:01.413]  And again.
[03:20:02.233 --> 03:20:04.414]  Trump didn't come in here with FEMA and take over.
[03:20:04.414 --> 03:20:05.735]  He got out of everybody's way.
[03:20:05.735 --> 03:20:13.199]  Yeah, but FEMA on the coast, and this event that he's talking about, they went in and they blocked volunteers from coming in and helping people.
[03:20:13.199 --> 03:20:14.259]  Because that was Obama.
[03:20:14.259 --> 03:20:16.861]  Because everything had to go through them.
[03:20:16.861 --> 03:20:18.221]  They wouldn't let...exactly.
[03:20:18.221 --> 03:20:19.322]  That was the Obama approach.
[03:20:19.322 --> 03:20:22.343]  That was also the approach of George W. Bush's administration.
[03:20:22.343 --> 03:20:23.764]  Notice how different Trump is?
[03:20:23.764 --> 03:20:25.605]  This is the best response ever though.
[03:20:25.785 --> 03:20:27.107]  That's good, that's good.
[03:20:27.107 --> 03:20:36.119]  But that's what, when I look at the responses, Alex, and they're talking to Ted Cruz and other people, we've got to get past this idea that everything needs to go through Washington.
[03:20:36.119 --> 03:20:36.699]  No, I agree.
[03:20:36.699 --> 03:20:37.380]  No, no, no.
[03:20:37.380 --> 03:20:38.281]  How good is Trump?
[03:20:38.281 --> 03:20:39.343]  I'm not discussing Trump.
[03:20:39.343 --> 03:20:41.586]  Trump said, we're waiting, whatever help you need, we're out of it.
[03:20:41.866 --> 03:20:43.087]  But the media is pushing this up.
[03:20:43.087 --> 03:20:43.687]  What is Trump doing?
[03:20:43.687 --> 03:20:44.588]  What is Trump going to do?
[03:20:44.588 --> 03:20:49.412]  It's like the best thing he can do, as you're pointing out, is to get out of the way and let volunteers help each other in the community.
[03:20:49.412 --> 03:20:50.433]  That's what he's doing.
[03:20:50.433 --> 03:20:51.433]  That's a great thing.
[03:20:51.433 --> 03:20:54.075]  Which shows his inherent smarts.
[03:20:54.075 --> 03:20:54.696]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:20:54.696 --> 03:20:56.858]  How is some guy from FEMA going to know what the hell to do?
[03:20:56.858 --> 03:21:02.302]  Let the police departments, the sheriff's departments help and work with the locals and everybody get out of the way and let it happen.
[03:21:02.302 --> 03:21:02.642]  That's right.
[03:21:02.762 --> 03:21:04.083]  The cops deal with the looters.
[03:21:04.083 --> 03:21:04.524]  That's right.
[03:21:04.524 --> 03:21:11.451]  Local cops, local firefighters working with local churches and volunteers and people who are shipping in food from the outside.
[03:21:11.451 --> 03:21:16.116]  That's what needs to happen and that's what often doesn't happen when the federal government gets involved with FEMA.
[03:21:16.116 --> 03:21:16.696]  It's amazing.
[03:21:16.696 --> 03:21:17.237]  Brad, go ahead.
[03:21:18.769 --> 03:21:20.751]  Thank you so much.
[03:21:20.751 --> 03:21:37.888]  I've had the honor of being deployed with the Austin Disaster Relief Network on two major disaster relief efforts as a ham operator in those instances, one in Texas and one in Denham Springs, Louisiana during the Great Flood.
[03:21:38.588 --> 03:21:50.334]  And I want everyone to know that what you, Alex, have said about the Incident Command System of FEMA is exactly correct.
[03:21:50.334 --> 03:21:56.877]  That it is designed to work from the lowest level to the government.
[03:21:56.877 --> 03:21:58.338]  It happens locally.
[03:21:58.338 --> 03:22:06.062]  When that's overwhelmed, it moves up, moves up, moves up, moves up until the governor has to... Hello?
[03:22:06.062 --> 03:22:06.462]  You're on air.
[03:22:06.462 --> 03:22:06.702]  Go ahead.
[03:22:07.785 --> 03:22:15.252]  I'm sorry, until the governor has to ask for assistance from the FEMA agency, and then FEMA will come in.
[03:22:15.252 --> 03:22:22.239]  And that's why the governor, that's why Abbott was calling the mayor going, dude, are you at least going to tell folks to get out of low water areas?
[03:22:23.345 --> 03:22:29.088]  You might not have gotten any help at all without Abbott from the federal government.
[03:22:29.088 --> 03:22:33.691]  This guy, this mayor, is such an idiot.
[03:22:33.691 --> 03:22:38.233]  I'm sorry to say it that way, but Scripture says it best.
[03:22:38.233 --> 03:22:42.956]  Showing themselves as wise, they prove themselves to be fools.
[03:22:43.756 --> 03:22:53.086]  And they just want the authority with no responsibility and a big paycheck and not be accountable and it's not going to be that way.
[03:22:53.086 --> 03:22:53.646]  And that's it.
[03:22:53.646 --> 03:22:56.910]  Globalists and their minions and this modern narcissistic sickness.
[03:22:56.910 --> 03:23:00.954]  People want to pretend there's something instead of the responsibility that comes with it.
[03:23:01.636 --> 03:23:07.538]  Yeah, I think the key thing the government can do is give us as honest as they can to the best information that they have.
[03:23:07.538 --> 03:23:09.318]  Tell us what is coming.
[03:23:09.318 --> 03:23:12.279]  And once they make a decision, because there's other stuff on the other side of this.
[03:23:12.279 --> 03:23:15.520]  They've had cases where they evacuated people and that caused people to die.
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:18.721]  So I understand that it's a difficult decision for people to make.
[03:23:18.721 --> 03:23:21.923]  But the key thing is, is that we can think on our own.
[03:23:21.923 --> 03:23:23.383]  We can take actions on our own.
[03:23:23.383 --> 03:23:24.443]  They need to advise us.
[03:23:24.443 --> 03:23:26.224]  They need to give us the appropriate information.
[03:23:26.864 --> 03:23:26.964]  Yes.
[03:23:44.338 --> 03:23:46.540]  To not be shut down by a heavy... Sure, sure.
[03:23:46.540 --> 03:23:53.526]  Well, I mean, I've just covered disasters, and I guess I've been involved in some aid, but nothing, you know, mainly just sending things and, you know, helping some local churches before.
[03:23:53.526 --> 03:23:58.130]  But I just knew that the way FEMA works, it goes from the top, I mean, from the bottom up.
[03:23:58.130 --> 03:23:59.191]  That's the way it's supposed to work.
[03:23:59.191 --> 03:24:03.454]  So what Bush did and Obama's done is basically ass backwards, as they say.
[03:24:03.454 --> 03:24:04.555]  Yeah, from top down.
[03:24:04.555 --> 03:24:07.277]  So now this mayor standing down and being partisan
[03:24:08.458 --> 03:24:11.080]  For no reason, has made this a lot worse.
[03:24:11.080 --> 03:24:12.041]  Thank you Brad.
[03:24:12.041 --> 03:24:14.062]  Let's talk to HB.
[03:24:14.062 --> 03:24:15.543]  HB is in FEMA Region 4.
[03:24:15.543 --> 03:24:18.364]  Go ahead.
[03:24:18.364 --> 03:24:21.146]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to comment about this weather.
[03:24:21.146 --> 03:24:25.369]  It looks like it's being manipulated down there like Katrina and Sandy was.
[03:24:26.623 --> 03:24:33.572]  Geoengineering Watch knows a good place to go for that, but this is like the storm that hit Nashville and flooded Operland a few years ago.
[03:24:33.572 --> 03:24:39.260]  The storm system just set out west of town about three days and dumped 17 inches of rain on there.
[03:24:39.963 --> 03:24:45.605]  But then, they've been doing that since Vietnam, you know, so don't think that they can't... Well, that is on the... The media will say I'm saying this was staged.
[03:24:45.605 --> 03:24:46.745]  I'm not saying that.
[03:24:46.745 --> 03:24:50.047]  But it is on the Weather Channel, and I've interviewed Ben Levinson and the top experts.
[03:24:50.047 --> 03:24:55.869]  They can take a clear sky in one day with like 14 airplanes, have it rain 10 feet of water, and flood the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[03:24:55.869 --> 03:24:56.449]  Oh yeah.
[03:24:56.449 --> 03:25:02.151]  So they've got those technologies, and that's what earlier callers were saying is, why don't we use the technologies to kill it out in the Gulf?
[03:25:03.311 --> 03:25:04.972]  I mean, you can't say one way or the other.
[03:25:04.972 --> 03:25:05.933]  Here's the problem, though.
[03:25:05.933 --> 03:25:10.116]  Trump is so blocked off from government, and they are ignoring him and all the agencies.
[03:25:10.116 --> 03:25:14.058]  It's so rogue, because they don't want him to find out all the stuff they are doing.
[03:25:14.058 --> 03:25:15.659]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:25:15.659 --> 03:25:18.241]  They keep him sequestered and firewalled from the information.
[03:25:18.241 --> 03:25:19.081]  What do you think, David?
[03:25:19.081 --> 03:25:21.003]  I mean, it is weird how these storms got going.
[03:25:21.003 --> 03:25:22.264]  They just sent over a city.
[03:25:22.264 --> 03:25:24.405]  Like, they're moving around doing it, and they go, oh, just stay right here.
[03:25:24.625 --> 03:25:27.947]  Yeah, it is very unusual and they said it's as natural.
[03:25:27.947 --> 03:25:29.368]  They said it's the worst ever.
[03:25:29.368 --> 03:25:31.590]  So it is unusual, HB.
[03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:32.590]  Very, very unusual.
[03:25:32.590 --> 03:25:34.111]  And we know that they're doing geoengineering.
[03:25:34.111 --> 03:25:39.775]  Look, they have geoengineering conferences and they talk about the fact we need to use our capability to control the weather.
[03:25:39.775 --> 03:25:42.377]  The only question is, who gets to adjust the thermostat?
[03:25:42.377 --> 03:25:44.078]  So they're not even saying that it is.
[03:25:44.078 --> 03:25:49.622]  And we know that there was a weather treaty back in the late 1970s where they said we're not going to use this as a weapon.
[03:25:49.622 --> 03:25:51.122]  But we can do it for research purposes.
[03:25:51.122 --> 03:25:51.863]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:25:54.024 --> 03:25:55.866]  The breakaway civilization has this.
[03:25:55.866 --> 03:25:57.067]  It doesn't want us to know.
[03:25:57.067 --> 03:25:59.909]  We've gotten a president in there to find out what's going on.
[03:25:59.909 --> 03:26:01.630]  They're like, sir, don't look behind the curtain.
[03:26:01.630 --> 03:26:03.031]  You stay over there and shut up.
[03:26:03.031 --> 03:26:06.313]  And that's what you're going to cover when we come back is more and more.
[03:26:06.313 --> 03:26:07.274]  I'll go back to you in a minute, HB.
[03:26:07.274 --> 03:26:11.076]  I mean, Tillerson's like, well, I'm not with Trump, basically.
[03:26:11.076 --> 03:26:12.077]  Yeah.
[03:26:12.077 --> 03:26:14.099]  Cohen's bad-mouthing him.
[03:26:14.099 --> 03:26:16.760]  And then reportedly, he's like, Trump's confronting him behind the scenes.
[03:26:16.760 --> 03:26:19.843]  He's like, OK, I've gotten rid of everybody you said you wanted gone now.
[03:26:19.843 --> 03:26:21.284]  Do your job.
[03:26:21.284 --> 03:26:22.404]  So it's really coming to a head.
[03:26:23.345 --> 03:26:28.609]  And it's about time because I think at this point Trump realizes that he's not going to be able to work with these people.
[03:26:28.609 --> 03:26:31.452]  They're not like the people that he's worked with in business.
[03:26:31.452 --> 03:26:33.513]  These are people with a political agenda.
[03:26:33.513 --> 03:26:34.895]  It is a religion to them.
[03:26:34.895 --> 03:26:36.356]  They're not going to cooperate.
[03:26:36.356 --> 03:26:37.697]  They will burn down the country.
[03:26:37.697 --> 03:26:40.019]  It's about their power over everybody.
[03:26:40.019 --> 03:26:40.379]  Exactly.
[03:26:40.379 --> 03:26:41.700]  They get the life extension.
[03:26:41.700 --> 03:26:43.442]  They get the weather modification.
[03:26:43.442 --> 03:26:45.123]  They get the data to spy on you.
[03:26:45.123 --> 03:26:47.465]  They get over-the-horizon predictive computer programming.
[03:26:47.625 --> 03:26:49.046]  They get the surveillance grid.
[03:26:49.046 --> 03:26:50.747]  They get to force-inoculate you.
[03:26:50.747 --> 03:26:52.508]  They get to tell your kids what they're going to be.
[03:26:52.508 --> 03:26:54.229]  They get to sexualize your children.
[03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:55.450]  They get to play God.
[03:26:55.450 --> 03:26:57.691]  And you're going to sit there and you're going to take it.
[03:26:57.691 --> 03:26:58.411]  Yeah.
[03:26:58.411 --> 03:26:59.552]  That's exactly what he's saying.
[03:26:59.552 --> 03:27:04.635]  HB?
[03:27:04.635 --> 03:27:05.135]  Okay.
[03:27:05.135 --> 03:27:06.996]  You're done, HB?
[03:27:06.996 --> 03:27:07.457]  No, no, no.
[03:27:07.457 --> 03:27:08.217]  I didn't know you were coming back.
[03:27:08.217 --> 03:27:09.478]  I thought I was going to wait until the break.
[03:27:09.478 --> 03:27:10.098]  No, go ahead.
[03:27:10.098 --> 03:27:12.179]  Finish up.
[03:27:12.179 --> 03:27:12.640]  Oh, okay.
[03:27:13.775 --> 03:27:14.956]  Go to the first episode.
[03:27:14.956 --> 03:27:18.238]  Do you ever watch Tales of Wells Fargo with Dale Robertson?
[03:27:18.238 --> 03:27:20.800]  No, I don't watch a lot of TV, I'll be honest.
[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:23.001]  Well, it's an old western, back in the 60s.
[03:27:23.001 --> 03:27:30.386]  The very first episode, they showed it again the other night, and there was chemtrails crossing each other behind them.
[03:27:30.386 --> 03:27:34.669]  They're putting chemtrails in these old black and white westerns.
[03:27:34.669 --> 03:27:39.652]  And one more thing, I want to thank you for discussing 9-11 and all the unknown weapons technology they used.
[03:27:40.442 --> 03:27:49.029]  And I'm calling from Knoxville, and I saw the other day where our mayor, Madeline Ruggiero, wants Knoxville to be a sanctuary city, and we have to fight it.
[03:27:49.029 --> 03:27:52.212]  And again, I can't go to Mexico and have a sanctuary city.
[03:27:52.212 --> 03:27:54.434]  For me, it's all about bankrupting things.
[03:27:54.434 --> 03:27:55.015]  God bless you.
[03:27:55.015 --> 03:27:56.176]  Well, here's what's happened.
[03:27:56.176 --> 03:27:59.558]  Normal con... People have these debates with me about geoengineering, and they go...
[03:28:00.479 --> 03:28:03.603]  Alex, jets have always left condensation trails.
[03:28:03.603 --> 03:28:04.785]  It's crystals.
[03:28:04.785 --> 03:28:05.225]  Ice crystals.
[03:28:05.225 --> 03:28:06.427]  And I go, yeah, I know that.
[03:28:06.427 --> 03:28:15.998]  And there was a Nobel Prize in 92 for coming up with a plan to, quote, protect the Earth's atmosphere, adding barium salts and things to the jet fuel.
[03:28:15.998 --> 03:28:18.502]  Now NASA admits the atmosphere is 20 plus percent darker.
[03:28:19.517 --> 03:28:20.758]  There is manipulation.
[03:28:20.758 --> 03:28:25.301]  I'm not having this fake debate where I'm saying there's no such thing as condensation trails.
[03:28:25.301 --> 03:28:25.922]  I know that.
[03:28:25.922 --> 03:28:30.345]  They admit there's giant, secret weather modification programs going on.
[03:28:30.345 --> 03:28:31.346]  David Knight, you're taking over.
[03:28:31.346 --> 03:28:33.428]  You've got a ton to cover when he comes back.
[03:28:33.428 --> 03:28:34.348]  Great job to the crew.
[03:28:34.348 --> 03:28:37.331]  We're going to have other live reports throughout the evening.
[03:28:37.331 --> 03:28:39.532]  So much more to cover, but a really dangerous precedent.
[03:28:40.709 --> 03:28:53.773]  In San Francisco with them just beating the hell out of people, big mobs beating people up, and Pelosi praising it, and then the news calling, look how peaceful we are, and we break your jaw, and so cowardly to watch this.
[03:28:53.773 --> 03:29:05.997]  You know, it's full spectrum, Alex, because we've got this type of violence on the street to stop anybody from talking on the street, while we've got our corporate masters shutting down the monetization of any free speech on the internet.
[03:29:05.997 --> 03:29:06.877]  It's full spectrum.
[03:29:06.977 --> 03:29:08.037]  Our listeners can stop them.
[03:29:08.037 --> 03:29:09.658]  They can support our local affiliates.
[03:29:09.658 --> 03:29:11.158]  They can pick up David Knight and The Real News.
[03:29:11.158 --> 03:29:14.099]  They can pick up our show and they can buy our products.
[03:29:14.099 --> 03:29:16.920]  Forty-seven, forty-five percent off X2.
[03:29:16.920 --> 03:29:18.300]  Fifty-plus percent off.
[03:29:18.300 --> 03:29:18.780]  Never done fifty-five.
[03:29:18.780 --> 03:29:19.160]  Fifty-seven.
[03:29:19.160 --> 03:29:21.261]  Fifty-seven percent off on the Super Mill.
[03:29:21.261 --> 03:29:22.481]  Just look, we're committed.
[03:29:22.481 --> 03:29:23.501]  We're gonna win.
[03:29:23.501 --> 03:29:25.402]  This censorship never works in history.
[03:29:25.402 --> 03:29:26.322]  They're going to fail.
[03:29:26.322 --> 03:29:27.462]  Just stay the course.
[03:29:27.462 --> 03:29:28.283]  God bless you all.
[03:29:28.283 --> 03:29:29.703]  Infowarstore.com.

[03:29:33.444 --> 03:29:34.325]  Just get aggressive.
[03:29:34.325 --> 03:29:35.505]  Hang up flyers in town.
[03:29:35.505 --> 03:29:36.266]  Get aggressive.
[03:29:36.266 --> 03:29:37.327]  Call C-SPAN.
[03:29:37.327 --> 03:29:37.767]  Call.
[03:29:37.767 --> 03:29:38.788]  Just call and talk radio.
[03:29:38.788 --> 03:29:39.108]  Fight!
[03:29:39.108 --> 03:29:39.568]  Fight!
[03:29:39.568 --> 03:29:40.349]  Fight!
[03:29:40.349 --> 03:29:41.049]  Fight!
[03:29:41.049 --> 03:29:43.351]  They want to shut you up because you're effective.
[03:29:43.351 --> 03:29:43.951]  We're winning!
[03:29:43.951 --> 03:29:44.472]  We're winning!
[03:29:44.472 --> 03:29:44.992]  We're winning!
[03:29:44.992 --> 03:29:45.492]  We're winning!
[03:29:45.492 --> 03:29:45.973]  We're winning!
[03:29:45.973 --> 03:29:46.433]  We're winning!
[03:29:52.762 --> 03:29:59.587]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[03:29:59.587 --> 03:30:02.149]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[03:30:02.149 --> 03:30:05.611]  Not in the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[03:30:05.611 --> 03:30:07.813]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[03:30:07.813 --> 03:30:12.636]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[03:30:12.636 --> 03:30:15.518]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[03:30:15.518 --> 03:30:19.721]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[03:30:22.623 --> 03:30:23.524]  Unprecedented.
[03:30:23.524 --> 03:30:24.746]  And it's cold-pressed.
[03:30:24.746 --> 03:30:26.688]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[03:30:26.688 --> 03:30:31.072]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are other what you sell.
[03:30:31.072 --> 03:30:35.097]  BuzzFeed said it's like there's already best-selling stuff that's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[03:30:35.097 --> 03:30:36.298]  Why these aren't anything new?
[03:30:36.298 --> 03:30:40.342]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best but cold-pressed?
[03:30:40.342 --> 03:30:40.563]  Duh.
[03:30:40.563 --> 03:30:40.903]  Duh.
[03:30:47.873 --> 03:30:56.965]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:30:56.965 --> 03:31:05.096]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:05.356 --> 03:31:10.219]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:10.219 --> 03:31:17.023]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:17.023 --> 03:31:24.208]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:24.208 --> 03:31:31.052]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:31.212 --> 03:31:35.696]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:35.696 --> 03:31:39.099]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:39.099 --> 03:31:45.404]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:45.404 --> 03:31:47.065]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[03:31:48.226 --> 03:31:53.607]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:31:53.607 --> 03:31:56.468]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:31:56.468 --> 03:31:58.448]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:31:58.448 --> 03:32:03.469]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:05.570]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:32:05.570 --> 03:32:06.850]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:32:06.850 --> 03:32:11.971]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:11.971 --> 03:32:15.312]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[03:32:15.652 --> 03:32:18.854]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:18.854 --> 03:32:21.836]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:21.836 --> 03:32:25.538]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:25.538 --> 03:32:32.442]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:32.442 --> 03:32:39.947]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[03:32:39.947 --> 03:32:42.829]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[03:32:43.249 --> 03:32:46.152]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:32:46.152 --> 03:33:00.103]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:21.408 --> 03:33:22.929]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.929 --> 03:33:26.193]  I'm David Knight, your host for this last half hour.
[03:33:26.193 --> 03:33:31.640]  I want to take a look at what Rex Tillerson did on Fox News with Chris Wallace.
[03:33:31.640 --> 03:33:36.366]  I think it's absolutely amazing and of course there's been a lot of pushback against President Trump over the weekend.
[03:33:36.926 --> 03:33:45.111]  After the pardon of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and by the way, he's going to be on our show tomorrow with Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Radio Show tomorrow.
[03:33:45.111 --> 03:33:53.135]  I'm not sure which hour he's going to be on, but between 11 and 2 Central Time, we're going to have Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[03:33:53.135 --> 03:34:02.360]  And of course, over the weekend, we had Paul Ryan and John McCain attack President Trump for pardoning Sheriff Joe, saying this violates the rule of law.
[03:34:02.360 --> 03:34:03.741]  Well, what violated the rule of law?
[03:34:04.460 --> 03:34:14.250]  Was the way that he was prosecuted, or I should say persecuted by this judge who came after him for criminal contempt but refused to give him a jury trial.
[03:34:14.250 --> 03:34:19.936]  As a matter of fact, even charged him with the wrong crime so they could refuse to give him a jury trial.
[03:34:19.936 --> 03:34:20.716]  It was a total...
[03:34:21.437 --> 03:34:46.757]  Kangaroo court and whether or not you agree with Sheriff Joe on this issue on immigration and of course right now we have the Trump administration talking about how they're going to partner with Sheriff departments throughout Texas and other states to help them to enforce immigration law we had Obama and this judge saying no no you're not going to enforce the law and if you enforce the law I'm gonna put you in jail that's what we saw here
[03:34:46.877 --> 03:34:47.017]  That's
[03:35:09.166 --> 03:35:17.311]  What happened on the Sunday show with Chris Wallace, this back and forth between Chris Wallace and Rex Tillerson.
[03:35:17.311 --> 03:35:28.058]  I think it's very interesting that Chris Wallace puts this out there saying, you've got a lot of international criticism, talking about Trump's response to what happened in Charlottesville, criticism for United Nations.
[03:35:28.058 --> 03:35:31.480]  How does that impact your ability to do your job?
[03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:32.901]  Taking it as a given,
[03:35:33.621 --> 03:35:35.222]  That Donald Trump did the wrong thing.
[03:35:35.222 --> 03:35:36.884]  Donald Trump did not do the wrong thing.
[03:35:36.884 --> 03:35:40.987]  But then of course Rex Tillerson piles on in a very interesting way.
[03:35:40.987 --> 03:35:41.547]  Here's that clip.
[03:35:52.356 --> 03:35:56.841]  The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news.
[03:36:13.297 --> 03:36:15.899]  And that's what Chris Wallace is doing with Fox News.
[03:36:15.899 --> 03:36:23.846]  Make it harder for you to push American values around the world when some foreign leaders question the president's values?
[03:36:23.846 --> 03:36:26.828]  Chris, we express America's values from the State Department.
[03:36:26.828 --> 03:36:36.236]  We represent the American people, we represent America's values, our commitment to freedom, our commitment to equal treatment of people the world over, and that message has never changed.
[03:36:36.796 --> 03:36:40.579]  And when the President gets into the kind of controversy he does and the U.N.
[03:36:40.579 --> 03:36:42.981]  Committee responds the way... Oh, gee, when the U.N.
[03:36:42.981 --> 03:36:48.666]  Committee responds... It seems to say they begin to doubt whether we're living those values.
[03:36:48.666 --> 03:36:58.074]  I don't believe anyone doubts the American people's values or the commitment of the American government or the government's agencies to advancing those values and defending those values.
[03:36:58.074 --> 03:36:59.995]  And the President's values?
[03:36:59.995 --> 03:37:03.538]  The President speaks for himself, Chris.
[03:37:03.538 --> 03:37:03.758]  Are you...
[03:37:05.059 --> 03:37:06.520]  Separating yourself from that, sir?
[03:37:06.520 --> 03:37:13.286]  I've spoken, I've made my own comments as to our values as well in a speech I gave to the State Department this past week.
[03:37:13.286 --> 03:37:14.667]  What arrogance!
[03:37:14.667 --> 03:37:15.928]  What arrogance!
[03:37:15.928 --> 03:37:19.711]  How long is this guy in the Trump White House?
[03:37:19.711 --> 03:37:27.416]  Clearly Trump should get rid of... He comes out and says, we at State Department, we express America's values from the State Department.
[03:37:28.357 --> 03:37:28.957]  Let me explain to you.
[03:37:28.957 --> 03:37:36.120]  When we talk about the swamp in Washington, for the longest time, the State Department has been known as Foggy Bottom.
[03:37:36.120 --> 03:37:38.381]  It is Swamp Central.
[03:37:38.381 --> 03:37:39.881]  And Rex Tillerson identifies with that.
[03:37:39.881 --> 03:37:43.162]  He said, we represent America's values.
[03:37:43.162 --> 03:37:44.923]  And then Chris Wall says, and the President's values?
[03:37:44.923 --> 03:37:50.205]  Because, you know, the President's been criticized by the United Nations, so therefore he must not represent America's values.
[03:37:50.205 --> 03:37:51.085]  And Tillerson said, well,
[03:37:51.505 --> 03:37:53.146]  The President speaks for himself.
[03:37:53.146 --> 03:37:55.667]  Are you separating yourself from the President?
[03:37:55.667 --> 03:37:56.667]  I've spoken.
[03:37:56.667 --> 03:38:01.669]  I have made my own comments as well in a speech that I gave to the State Department this past week.
[03:38:01.669 --> 03:38:07.792]  So we have America's true values, America's true interests at heart, not the President, says Rex Tillerson.
[03:38:07.792 --> 03:38:09.493]  And Axios has reported.
[03:38:10.373 --> 03:38:20.038]  That sources inside the Trump administration have told him that there is a ticking problem with Rex Tillerson and it's growing louder by the day, citing officials inside and out and close to the White House.
[03:38:20.038 --> 03:38:28.002]  They said after Trump returned from a meeting on Afghanistan, a source, we don't know who the source is, recalled Trump saying, Rex just doesn't get it.
[03:38:28.522 --> 03:38:31.304]  He's totally establishment in his thinking.
[03:38:31.304 --> 03:38:36.328]  Trump is getting more and more fed up with Tillerson, who has still yet to staff his agency.
[03:38:36.328 --> 03:38:37.830]  Well, what does he need to staff his agency?
[03:38:37.830 --> 03:38:40.252]  I mean, he's got it filled with people from the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:38:40.252 --> 03:38:42.573]  He's got it filled with people from the Obama administration.
[03:38:42.573 --> 03:38:44.875]  He's got exactly what he wants.
[03:38:44.875 --> 03:38:48.378]  Rex Tillerson has been a globalist from day one.
[03:38:48.378 --> 03:38:52.862]  He has opposed Trump, opposed him for six months on the Paris Climate Agreement.
[03:38:53.732 --> 03:39:00.075]  Telling Trump that he did not need to distance himself or unsign what President Obama signed.
[03:39:00.075 --> 03:39:01.456]  And of course, that was a lie.
[03:39:01.456 --> 03:39:09.500]  And he was pushing the globalist agenda then, and now he is directly criticizing, along with Fox News' Chris Wallace, directly criticizing the President.
[03:39:10.100 --> 03:39:12.223]  Putting the words of the United Nations out there.
[03:39:12.223 --> 03:39:28.042]  Look, just as we saw in Berkeley, just as we've seen in every Trump event from the beginning of the campaign, through the campaign, and after the election, we have seen these leftist, socialist, Marxist, Antifa people show up and get violent.
[03:39:28.422 --> 03:39:33.906]  With the people who were peacefully attending a political rally, attacking them, attacking the police.
[03:39:33.906 --> 03:39:35.647]  That's what Trump was talking about.
[03:39:35.647 --> 03:39:43.772]  It isn't equivocating these people to the Ku Klux Klan, but quite frankly, they should be equivocated to them because they're cut from the same cloth.
[03:39:43.772 --> 03:39:50.677]  These people have fascist tendencies, just as the KKK and the neo-Nazis have fascist tendencies.
[03:39:50.677 --> 03:39:52.538]  They want to shut down free speech.
[03:39:52.538 --> 03:39:53.839]  They want to do it violently.
[03:39:54.139 --> 03:40:00.384]  And there is an equivocation to be made with them, and we need to make that very clear and not back down from it.
[03:40:00.384 --> 03:40:05.048]  I thought that what Trump said was spot on, and I think most of the people in this country did.
[03:40:05.048 --> 03:40:12.195]  But of course, the establishment press and the State Department and Rex Tillerson and Chris Wallace do not like what he had to say.
[03:40:12.195 --> 03:40:14.136]  Joining us now is Michael Zimmerman.
[03:40:14.136 --> 03:40:15.778]  Michael, are you in a safe place now?
[03:40:17.051 --> 03:40:18.693]  Safer than where we were earlier, for sure.
[03:40:18.693 --> 03:40:22.096]  Alright, tell us what you're seeing now, and give us a little bit of background on what's going on.
[03:40:22.096 --> 03:40:25.339]  So, I was actually able to drive through much of the medical center in Houston.
[03:40:25.339 --> 03:40:28.101]  Houston has the largest medical center in the world.
[03:40:28.101 --> 03:40:34.167]  It basically looks like most of these downtown districts, but it is all hospitals, doctor's offices, things like that.
[03:40:34.167 --> 03:40:36.669]  And it usually has very bad flooding issues there.
[03:40:37.603 --> 03:40:40.604]  But it didn't look like anything was underwater at this time.
[03:40:40.604 --> 03:40:45.387]  Let me stop you right there because you said it usually has very bad flooding issues.
[03:40:45.387 --> 03:40:46.827]  You lived in Houston for a while.
[03:40:46.827 --> 03:40:47.928]  I lived in Houston for a while.
[03:40:47.928 --> 03:40:50.229]  I was in Houston 35 years ago.
[03:40:50.229 --> 03:40:52.550]  I lived there for three years, 35 years ago.
[03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:56.172]  And I used to see, as you just pointed out, it usually has flooding issues.
[03:40:56.972 --> 03:40:59.354]  We all know that Houston floods very, very easily.
[03:40:59.354 --> 03:41:07.399]  And when the mayor starts to complain and criticize other people politically, we need to understand that it's local government that needs to do something.
[03:41:07.399 --> 03:41:12.222]  They've had decades to do something about the flooding issues that are endemic to Houston.
[03:41:12.222 --> 03:41:21.328]  And just like we've seen in many other places, like in Louisiana and so forth, when they have these levy systems, there are other things that they should have, could have done to mitigate some of this.
[03:41:21.328 --> 03:41:23.330]  Now, this is an unprecedented flood.
[03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:26.652]  Nevertheless, this is a common problem in Houston, as you just pointed out.
[03:41:27.512 --> 03:41:43.783]  Well, in the last large flood here, they actually left the flood doors open to one of the city parking garages in downtown Houston, and water flowed in and destroyed a large number of police vehicles and other city vehicles purchased with your tax dollars because no one could be bothered to go close the door.
[03:41:43.783 --> 03:41:44.784]  That's amazing.
[03:41:44.784 --> 03:41:45.625]  That's amazing.
[03:41:45.625 --> 03:41:53.910]  Well, you've had an amazing two or three days there as you've been trying to skirt the chaos and the floods in that area.
[03:41:53.910 --> 03:41:54.671]  What are your plans now?
[03:41:56.494 --> 03:41:59.721]  I'm going to stick around tomorrow, see if we can find out where President Trump's going to be.
[03:41:59.721 --> 03:42:07.457]  He's, you know, supposedly coming here tomorrow to, as presidents often do, you know, look at the relief effort.
[03:42:08.496 --> 03:42:10.518]  You know, big boots on the ground there.
[03:42:10.518 --> 03:42:10.798]  That's right.
[03:42:10.798 --> 03:42:16.564]  But I'm going to try to see him, see some other areas in town that are still underwater.
[03:42:16.564 --> 03:42:23.250]  Mobility was pretty limited with the freeways being shut down, but more and more roads are starting to open and be passable so I can get to more parts of the city.
[03:42:23.250 --> 03:42:33.560]  But when I arrived last night, I was actually not able to get into downtown or actually within, you're familiar with Houston, inside of Loop 610, which is a very large chunk of the city, not being able to even enter that.
[03:42:34.255 --> 03:42:35.856]  But today I was able to move around more.
[03:42:35.856 --> 03:42:38.017]  I'm in the Museum District at the moment.
[03:42:38.017 --> 03:42:39.837]  It doesn't look like flooding was too bad here.
[03:42:39.837 --> 03:42:44.239]  You know, definitely not what we've seen with people being rescued on boats in this part of town.
[03:42:44.239 --> 03:42:46.700]  So, we're definitely going to keep looking around.
[03:42:46.700 --> 03:42:55.504]  This morning they were saying that the storm was going to go back out to sea, go a bit south, build, and then they're expecting it to come back north and to park over Houston again.
[03:42:55.504 --> 03:42:56.344]  Are they still saying that?
[03:42:57.378 --> 03:42:58.639]  That's what I've heard.
[03:42:58.639 --> 03:43:04.662]  Which, it looks like the bayous are coping at this point and water is actually starting to drain from many of these neighborhoods.
[03:43:04.662 --> 03:43:14.287]  Earlier, when I was on with Alex and Owen, they pulled up these clips and you could see in these photos where the water line was probably about six feet into some of these houses.
[03:43:14.287 --> 03:43:14.947]  Completely destroyed.
[03:43:14.947 --> 03:43:19.370]  But then today, overnight, the water is completely down and you can drive on the streets.
[03:43:19.370 --> 03:43:21.651]  So it's been interesting how things have happened here.
[03:43:22.131 --> 03:43:23.151]  That's amazing.
[03:43:23.151 --> 03:43:31.615]  Yeah, it's one of the worst towns for this type of thing to happen in Houston, where they already have problems with drainage, problems with flooding.
[03:43:31.615 --> 03:43:33.115]  A real catastrophe there.
[03:43:33.115 --> 03:43:35.076]  Thank you, Michael, and keep in touch with us.
[03:43:35.076 --> 03:43:37.497]  We'll be looking for more of your reports.
[03:43:37.497 --> 03:43:43.239]  And as we look at this, and as I pointed out earlier today, you know, we're talking about this physical flooding that's going on in Houston.
[03:43:44.326 --> 03:43:50.231]  If they didn't have a big event like this to take up all the media's attention, they would have to create one.
[03:43:50.231 --> 03:44:12.309]  Because at the end of last week, we had all the central bankers in the world meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, talking about what they're going to do to the rest of us, to the precariat, to the people who are in a precarious economic position because of their globalist policies and who present a precarious danger to the globalist elite.
[03:44:13.590 --> 03:44:17.834]  And I just got finished watching with my family a series that I thought was really excellent.
[03:44:17.834 --> 03:44:25.220]  If you haven't seen it, there's very few movies that are done about the Revolutionary War because Hollywood doesn't seem to be interested in it for some reason or the other.
[03:44:25.220 --> 03:44:27.742]  I think I know why, as we see them tear down the monuments.
[03:44:27.742 --> 03:44:30.884]  But they typically don't do movies about the American Revolution.
[03:44:30.884 --> 03:44:33.026]  This one stretched over four seasons.
[03:44:33.026 --> 03:44:41.833]  It had a very interesting perspective in terms of looking at the people who were the eyes and ears of Washington behind the scenes, in terms of his spies.
[03:44:42.674 --> 03:44:50.881]  It was, I think, the best Revolutionary War series that I've ever seen in terms of the quality, in terms of the acting and the writing and so forth.
[03:44:50.881 --> 03:44:53.563]  But there was one part of it that I thought was very interesting.
[03:44:53.563 --> 03:44:55.665]  And it's something that we've seen over and over again.
[03:44:55.665 --> 03:45:04.612]  At one point, the British government decided that they were going to undermine the revolutionaries by printing counterfeit currency.
[03:45:04.612 --> 03:45:06.594]  Now, of course, we did the same thing in World War II.
[03:45:07.951 --> 03:45:11.513]  The Germans did it, tried to do it to us, we did it to them to a certain extent.
[03:45:11.513 --> 03:45:15.356]  It is an act of war when you counterfeit currencies.
[03:45:15.356 --> 03:45:23.381]  But as we look at these bankers who are meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming over the weekend, that's precisely what they're doing.
[03:45:23.381 --> 03:45:26.343]  You know, we have in the Constitution, Article 1, Section 10,
[03:45:27.691 --> 03:45:32.793]  Nothing but gold and silver coin to be tendered in payment of debts.
[03:45:32.793 --> 03:45:34.973]  What is it about that that they don't get?
[03:45:34.973 --> 03:45:42.035]  Why is it that we can't audit what this private corporation, the Federal Reserve, does to control our money supply?
[03:45:42.035 --> 03:45:52.799]  To essentially run or destroy our economy with counterfeit printing, with massive fiat currency that there is no gold or silver behind it.
[03:45:52.799 --> 03:45:55.339]  They have broken that link.
[03:45:55.339 --> 03:45:56.640]  That was done back in the
[03:45:57.768 --> 03:46:08.297]  Nixon administration that was done with the idea of Henry Kissinger, that we would tie it to the petrodollar, that we'd work with the Saudis to create a worldwide currency.
[03:46:08.297 --> 03:46:12.541]  And yet, at this meeting that they had in Jackson Hole, that's precisely what they're doing.
[03:46:12.541 --> 03:46:20.669]  As we see Houston literally being flooded with water, and we see the damage that is done to people's lives, their life savings gone, their homes gone.
[03:46:21.249 --> 03:46:32.335]  We know that the Federal Reserve has the same capability to destroy people's lives, to take their homes, to destroy their life savings, by flooding us with...
[03:46:33.277 --> 03:46:34.517]  Fiat currency.
[03:46:34.517 --> 03:46:36.578]  And by manipulating the interest rate.
[03:46:36.578 --> 03:46:42.440]  So we had Janet Yellen, who was preaching the wonders of regulation.
[03:46:42.440 --> 03:46:47.602]  Things like the Dodd-Frank bill, which was set up to take small banks out of business.
[03:46:47.602 --> 03:46:50.342]  That is going back to the roots of the 2008 crash.
[03:46:52.503 --> 03:46:57.946]  It was in the 1990s, under the Clinton administration, that they began consolidating the banks.
[03:46:57.946 --> 03:46:59.547]  And I remember very well when that happened.
[03:46:59.547 --> 03:47:00.948]  It happened in North Carolina.
[03:47:00.948 --> 03:47:05.410]  It involved Nations Bank, which is headquartered in North Carolina, in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[03:47:05.410 --> 03:47:08.612]  It involved the merger of Nations Bank with Bank of America.
[03:47:08.612 --> 03:47:14.196]  Bank of America moved their headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, and they kept the name Bank of America.
[03:47:14.196 --> 03:47:17.377]  They kept the geographical location there in Charlotte.
[03:47:17.377 --> 03:47:18.058]  And at the time,
[03:47:19.267 --> 03:47:23.731]  As his chief of staff, there was a guy named Erskine Bowles in North Carolina.
[03:47:23.731 --> 03:47:26.714]  People were saying, we cannot approve this merger.
[03:47:26.714 --> 03:47:27.935]  Many opposed it.
[03:47:27.935 --> 03:47:35.221]  They said, this is going to cause a race and we're going to end up with about a half dozen banks, which is exactly what happened.
[03:47:36.181 --> 03:47:51.268]  Everybody set off, once they approved that, once the Clinton administration approved that for these people in North Carolina, for Erskine Boll and the others who are pushing this for moving the headquarters of what would then be the largest bank, the Combined Assets of Nations Bank and Bank of America.
[03:47:51.268 --> 03:47:58.492]  Once they did that, that set off a run of mergers and we wound up with about a half dozen banks that were too big to fail.
[03:47:59.272 --> 03:48:10.963]  At the same time, Bill Clinton got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act, which was supposed to stop speculative investments by financial institutions like banks that were covered by federal deposit insurance.
[03:48:10.963 --> 03:48:13.685]  All of that came together in a perfect storm.
[03:48:14.426 --> 03:48:20.992]  And created, I would argue, more financial disaster than we're going to see out of this massive storm in Houston.
[03:48:20.992 --> 03:48:23.935]  Yes, it's going to have economic consequences, especially for the people that are there.
[03:48:23.935 --> 03:48:26.037]  And it's going to have national consequences.
[03:48:26.037 --> 03:48:34.985]  We're already told that because of the number of oil refineries in that area, we can expect to see gas prices go up by at least 25 cents per gallon.
[03:48:34.985 --> 03:48:38.187]  Maybe more, depending on how long this lasts and how much damage is done there.
[03:48:38.928 --> 03:48:43.731]  But you know what the economic disaster of 2008 led to.
[03:48:43.731 --> 03:48:54.758]  This pumping of people into these speculative investments is both the combined actions of the Federal Reserve and the actions of these banks that created these speculative derivatives.
[03:48:55.638 --> 03:48:56.779]  That took everybody down.
[03:48:56.779 --> 03:49:00.681]  And yet we have Janet Yellen bragging about the benefits of financial regulation.
[03:49:00.681 --> 03:49:09.045]  This is Dodd-Frank coming in after the fact, creating regulations that would drive the small community banks out of business if in fact any of them survive.
[03:49:09.045 --> 03:49:11.926]  Remember when Matt Drudge used to put up on a regular basis 160
[03:49:13.607 --> 03:49:18.071]  Banks, small banks have now closed this year, and then the next year 170, the next year 180.
[03:49:18.071 --> 03:49:28.100]  He used to keep a running tab on that, showing articles as this was happening, as we're seeing more and more consolidation in the banking industry, even after 2008.
[03:49:28.100 --> 03:49:36.048]  So now we have Janet Yellen, and as one British economist tweeted out, he said, so Yellen is talking about the benefits of financial regulation.
[03:49:36.588 --> 03:49:39.969]  Which basically strangles anybody but the biggest banks.
[03:49:39.969 --> 03:49:48.913]  And Mario Draghi from the European Central Bank is talking about the benefits of trade managed by these globalist organizations.
[03:49:48.913 --> 03:49:52.894]  He said that means that Jackson Hole is basically a big FU to Trump.
[03:49:52.894 --> 03:49:57.516]  And you have to understand, Janet Yellen's term is up in February.
[03:49:57.516 --> 03:50:03.338]  And people are saying, well, it looks like she has doomed her chances for a second term at the Fed.
[03:50:03.338 --> 03:50:04.939]  She should be dooming the Fed.
[03:50:06.277 --> 03:50:07.378]  That should be the end of the Fed.
[03:50:07.378 --> 03:50:15.288]  We should not be allowing this private organization to do whatever they wish to manage our economy, just like the rest of these central bankers.
[03:50:15.288 --> 03:50:22.276]  We should not allow them to manage our economy without giving an answer to our elected representatives.
[03:50:22.276 --> 03:50:24.118]  That's what Audit the Fed is about.
[03:50:24.318 --> 03:50:27.460]  And that's one of the reasons why they shut down Ron Paul.
[03:50:27.460 --> 03:50:31.682]  It's one of the reasons why they shut down my video on the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Fed.
[03:50:31.682 --> 03:50:36.945]  I compared it to the phony events that were being managed in It's a Wonderful Life.
[03:50:36.945 --> 03:50:39.606]  I called it It's a Wonderful Lie.
[03:50:39.606 --> 03:50:45.029]  And it's a lie that is very wonderful for the central government and the people who want to manipulate our economy.
[03:50:45.029 --> 03:50:45.649]  Stay with us.
[03:50:45.649 --> 03:50:46.210]  We'll be right back.

[03:54:15.413 --> 03:54:16.855]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.855 --> 03:54:19.618]  I'm David Knight, your host for this last segment.
[03:54:19.618 --> 03:54:23.282]  And again, tomorrow morning you can join us on Real News with David Knight.
[03:54:23.282 --> 03:54:25.304]  You can find that, that's the name of the YouTube channel.
[03:54:25.304 --> 03:54:30.490]  You can find it streaming there or you can find it streaming on Facebook at RealNewsX2.
[03:54:30.490 --> 03:54:33.794]  That's Facebook.com forward slash RealNewsX2.
[03:54:33.794 --> 03:54:35.596]  You can find it streaming there as well.
[03:54:36.485 --> 03:54:42.629]  Before we get back to the news, I just want to remind you of the specials that we put up at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:42.629 --> 03:54:54.356]  We have a super combo, Get Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and BioTruth Selenium for 45% off, a limited time, only at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:54.356 --> 03:54:59.839]  And as you know, there's no question that you need selenium and you need iodine.
[03:54:59.839 --> 03:55:04.082]  Selenium supports the immune system, the DNA production, thyroid health, and eyesight.
[03:55:04.682 --> 03:55:09.945]  Iodine is one of the things that supports your healthy hormone levels, healthy metabolism, and many other things.
[03:55:09.945 --> 03:55:15.889]  Even the CDC says that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world.
[03:55:15.889 --> 03:55:23.434]  Things like scurvy, if you don't get enough vitamin C. There are consequences if you don't get these essential elements here.
[03:55:23.434 --> 03:55:24.594]  Iodine, selenium.
[03:55:26.555 --> 03:55:29.276]  There's no question that you need these in your diet.
[03:55:29.276 --> 03:55:32.918]  The question is, what is the quality of source that you're going to get?
[03:55:32.918 --> 03:55:36.399]  Are you going to get something that is synthetic, something that has fillers in it?
[03:55:36.399 --> 03:55:38.400]  Our selenium is bio-true selenium.
[03:55:38.400 --> 03:55:41.241]  We call it that because it is not GMO.
[03:55:41.241 --> 03:55:42.081]  It is organic.
[03:55:42.081 --> 03:55:45.642]  It's made from mustard seeds, so it's a great source of selenium.
[03:55:45.642 --> 03:55:47.503]  And our nascent iodine comes from a deep
[03:55:48.183 --> 03:55:49.984]  Earth Source of Iodine.
[03:55:49.984 --> 03:55:52.486]  Both of those are very pure, very high quality.
[03:55:52.486 --> 03:55:58.211]  You can't get any higher quality, and now you can get them at 45% off for a limited time at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:55:58.211 --> 03:56:01.553]  Also, we have a limited time Flash Special.
[03:56:01.553 --> 03:56:04.555]  Our Flash Specials usually only go for a day or two.
[03:56:04.555 --> 03:56:08.038]  This is 57% off Supermail Vitality.
[03:56:08.038 --> 03:56:13.762]  That's the most, that's the deepest discount we've had for Supermail Vitality since we have introduced it.
[03:56:13.762 --> 03:56:16.304]  We've never discounted it to 57%, and it's one of our
[03:56:17.765 --> 03:56:18.505]  I think so.
[03:56:36.770 --> 03:56:38.551]  You know, I began talking about what YouTube did.
[03:57:03.263 --> 03:57:05.004]  To one of the videos that we had this week.
[03:57:05.004 --> 03:57:12.606]  We've been in operation here with Real News just for a week, and already we've had YouTube put an age restriction on one of our videos.
[03:57:12.606 --> 03:57:17.208]  And the title of the video was, Pedophile Government Grooms Kindergarteners.
[03:57:17.208 --> 03:57:28.692]  And this is based off a story that Kit Daniels put on Infowars.com, talking about the fact that in California, they were pushing transgender confusion on children in kindergarten.
[03:57:29.522 --> 03:57:32.523]  That is not age appropriate.
[03:57:32.523 --> 03:57:40.167]  I talked about the fact that we have the idea of the age of consent just for that reason.
[03:57:40.167 --> 03:57:50.032]  And I remember that just a few years ago, we had a father in Massachusetts who was concerned because he didn't want his 8-year-old going to the sex education class.
[03:57:50.032 --> 03:57:53.574]  And this was not, this was heterosexual at the time.
[03:57:53.574 --> 03:57:57.335]  This was not anything like the transgender confusion that we're seeing here.
[03:57:57.335 --> 03:57:58.096]  And they arrested him.
[03:57:59.102 --> 03:58:05.508]  And when he protested, they said, no, there's a doctrine called in loco parentis, in place of the parents.
[03:58:05.508 --> 03:58:14.235]  Once you drop your child off at the schoolroom door, you have relinquished control of your child to the state.
[03:58:14.235 --> 03:58:16.397]  That is why they say they can do this.
[03:58:16.397 --> 03:58:22.342]  And yet, we have YouTube putting any restriction on us talking about what they are doing to our children.
[03:58:22.342 --> 03:58:23.223]  Stay with us tomorrow.
[03:58:23.223 --> 03:58:25.024]  We're going to be back at 8 a.m.
[03:58:25.024 --> 03:58:25.585]  Central Time.
[03:58:29.767 --> 03:58:33.724]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:38.462 --> 03:58:40.063]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:59:27.700 --> 03:59:29.062]  That means it's clean.
[03:59:29.062 --> 03:59:30.264]  That means it's pure.
[03:59:30.264 --> 03:59:33.169]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
