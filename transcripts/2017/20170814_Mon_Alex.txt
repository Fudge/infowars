[00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:13.559]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.042]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:27.202]  We are now beginning to hear criticism bubble up on all sides of this event about the initial slow response by the police.
[00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:38.087]  When I got out of my car yesterday in Charlottesville for the first time at about 10 30 yesterday morning, you knew this was a bad scene and that bad things were going to be happening because people were congregating at Lee Park and Emancipation Park.
[00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:43.536]  Wearing helmets, body armor, carrying big heavy sticks.
[00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:46.558]  Nobody was intent upon peace here from either side.
[00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:49.501]  People were intent on causing havoc and causing damage.
[00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:54.385]  And even as wounded were being brought out of the park, the police were sitting idly by.
[00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:58.268]  I was standing by a cordoned off area where the police had set up as a station.
[00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:01.796]  That's Doug McKelvey reporting Saturday exactly what Millie Weaver
[00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.775]  And our camera crew reported.
[00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:36.437]  In fact, we even have the police at a distance, you can hear them saying, we've been told to stand down.
[00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:54.303]  You can also see police laughing as our crew is pepper sprayed by the anti-white, anti-America, so-called Antifa, George Soros scum force.
[00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:55.364]  Now, that said,
[00:01:56.414 --> 00:02:01.076]  The people playing in this whole white nationalist thing are morons.
[00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:09.100]  In my view, marching out there in the middle of this, you know you're going to give George Soros and the media the target they need.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:19.705]  Especially in Democrat-controlled cities where the police are going to stand down, and then you're going to be attacked, and then the media is going to say that you attacked.
[00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:24.307]  Even though 99% of the violence, until the car crashes out of the people, terribly,
[00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:32.490]  Is by the frothing, screaming, insane Soros people who are bussed in all over the country.
[00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.571]  We've got video of that confirming it.
[00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:38.713]  It's crazy.
[00:02:38.713 --> 00:02:44.776]  And that's what they want is violence in this country to divide people along racial lines even more.
[00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:46.057]  Look at the headlines on Drudge.
[00:02:46.057 --> 00:02:47.578]  Police stand down.
[00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:49.659]  That's the New York Times.
[00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.440]  Blamed for Virginia chaos.
[00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:54.395]  We were there.
[00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:59.058]  Our reporter was told, you gotta get out of here.
[00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:02.900]  We've been ordered to quote, stand down.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:11.646]  You just heard the Fox News reporter say, he was told by the police, it's too dangerous, we're leaving.
[00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:14.088]  Well, they did more than leave.
[00:03:14.088 --> 00:03:18.911]  They had our people, our reporters, kettled.
[00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:22.854]  And then forced everyone down through the fences to be attacked.
[00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:26.668]  By the Antifa, who can hardly talk.
[00:03:26.668 --> 00:03:27.709]  I mean, I've been at their events.
[00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.110]  You've seen countless footage.
[00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.670]  We've shot.
[00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.291]  Others have shot.
[00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:33.433]  You might have witnessed it yourself, in person.
[00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.515]  Screaming, howling.
[00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:38.777]  It's kind of their noise they just make on autopilot.
[00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:41.159]  With F-bomb, F-bomb, F-bomb.
[00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.962]  They see InfoWars, they go into mad hysteria.
[00:03:44.962 --> 00:03:50.287]  They start screaming, F-you white, F-you white, F-you white, when they're white.
[00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:51.548]  Mental patience.
[00:03:53.564 --> 00:04:02.088]  I mean, they're like the mirror image of the most mindless KKK person you could ever see.
[00:04:02.088 --> 00:04:04.729]  And they pepper sprayed Millie and Gavin.
[00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.409]  They attacked a Hill reporter.
[00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.071]  The Hill is one of the most venomous anti-Trump publications in the world.
[00:04:11.071 --> 00:04:16.133]  In fact, the woman they attacked is normally frothing anti-Trump.
[00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:17.494]  And she tells them that.
[00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:18.714]  Like, I saw the footage yesterday.
[00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:19.555]  We never played it, though.
[00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:33.546]  He'll report her punched by anti-racist protesters, what they call them, and they stomp her on the ground because she's a clean-cut woman.
[00:04:33.546 --> 00:04:42.011]  If you don't look like you've been on meth for 10 years, basically since you were born, a lot of the antifa look like 10-year-old meth heads, or 14-year-old meth heads.
[00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:49.796]  If you don't look like you were getting meth in your body, in your mommy's tummy, in utero, and that you have been used as toilet paper by Satan,
[00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:52.934]  You will be attacked at these.
[00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:53.594]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:59.517]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.517 --> 00:05:12.603]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:25.888]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[00:05:25.888 --> 00:05:42.192]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[00:05:42.632 --> 00:05:46.217]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming.
[00:05:46.217 --> 00:05:47.639]  It's already here.
[00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.864]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[00:05:51.864 --> 00:05:53.606]  Infowars.com
[00:05:58.522 --> 00:06:09.128]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:06:09.128 --> 00:06:11.189]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.050]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.551]  It's made in the USA.
[00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:15.671]  It's
[00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:16.852]  We're good to go.
[00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:50.961]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:29.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:42.588]  Saturday morning, by 11.30, I was already here, central time, and within five minutes of the news picking up,
[00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:49.256]  The race riot that ended up killing one person, injuring dozens in Charlottesville, Virginia.
[00:08:49.256 --> 00:09:02.644]  Within five minutes, President Trump tweeted out that he was decrying and absolutely repudiating racism.
[00:09:02.644 --> 00:09:05.806]  He then made a statement and went further saying we should love each other.
[00:09:07.392 --> 00:09:20.201]  and respect each other, and feel the love in the room, as he was already at a press conference scheduled with a multi-racial crowd of veterans.
[00:09:20.201 --> 00:09:21.582]  Didn't matter.
[00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:26.805]  Throughout the day, and yesterday, and today, they said Trump never repudiated it.
[00:09:26.805 --> 00:09:32.029]  Because he said both sides came looking for trouble.
[00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:33.290]  And that's absolutely true.
[00:09:35.896 --> 00:09:40.960]  So I'm going to show you the tweet, time-stamped, a little bit past noon eastern.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.243]  I mean, this thing was just getting started then.
[00:09:44.243 --> 00:09:50.769]  I was on the phone with my reporters, with Millie Weaver and Gavin, who were there.
[00:09:50.769 --> 00:10:02.279]  They were the first to report, with a live feed, as it happened, that the police said, we've been ordered to stand down, this is an unlawful assembly, civil emergency declared.
[00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:16.989]  And our reporters reported live that they were ordered and marched by the police through the gauntlet of the Soros Communists, is really what they are.
[00:10:16.989 --> 00:10:20.151]  Now you look at Drudge Report today.
[00:10:20.151 --> 00:10:23.674]  Why they call us fake news is because we're so on target.
[00:10:23.674 --> 00:10:31.038]  New York Times, police stand down, blame for Virginia chaos.
[00:10:31.038 --> 00:10:33.400]  Here is Fox News clip.
[00:10:34.804 --> 00:10:44.090]  With a Fox News reporter, Doug McKilloway, on the ground saying exactly what we said and what Millie Weaver said.
[00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.053]  And the point is, is that the New York Times, Newsweek,
[00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.742]  Raw story.
[00:10:50.742 --> 00:10:52.143]  The Washington Times.
[00:10:52.143 --> 00:10:53.745]  All the usual suspects.
[00:10:53.745 --> 00:10:56.307]  Establishment Republicans are after us as well.
[00:10:56.307 --> 00:10:59.569]  Came out and said, oh, Jones claims there was a stand down.
[00:10:59.569 --> 00:11:03.692]  Jones claims that that then allowed this to happen and was a type of false flag.
[00:11:03.692 --> 00:11:08.316]  Jones claims that Soros is funding these groups.
[00:11:08.316 --> 00:11:10.858]  Jones is so kooky, all of it has now come out.
[00:11:12.393 --> 00:11:16.017]  And I'm just pointing out that we had reporters there.
[00:11:16.017 --> 00:11:22.485]  You can watch the videos and see it for yourself and see the police say it.
[00:11:22.485 --> 00:11:25.768]  And see the police laugh when our reporters are attacked.
[00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:28.011]  Or Hill reporters.
[00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:30.534]  A New York Times reporter was there.
[00:11:30.534 --> 00:11:32.275]  She saw people attacked and said,
[00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:37.036]  That Antifa was just as bad as the white supremacists.
[00:11:37.036 --> 00:11:40.298]  Well, I'm not defending the white supremacists, but we have all the live footage.
[00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:47.383]  They were ten times worse, until the guy ran the people over, which was absolutely horrible.
[00:11:47.383 --> 00:11:51.105]  But she's being called a Nazi, and they're calling for her firing on Twitter.
[00:11:51.105 --> 00:11:52.046]  I've got those articles.
[00:11:52.876 --> 00:11:53.977]  She was there.
[00:11:53.977 --> 00:11:56.259]  She saw other reporters beat up.
[00:11:56.259 --> 00:11:57.920]  She saw people beat up.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.381]  There's even Mother Jones.
[00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:02.463]  Police stood by as mayhem mounted in Charlottesville.
[00:12:02.463 --> 00:12:04.505]  We told you.
[00:12:04.505 --> 00:12:21.057]  Just like eight days before, the former Deputy Director of the CIA and former Deputy Director of the FBI, Mudd, Phil Mudd, top CNN analyst, counterterrorism analyst, says, we're going to kill the President.
[00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.492]  Did I get a Newsweek retraction?
[00:12:28.492 --> 00:12:30.072]  Saying, okay, Alex Jones was dead on.
[00:12:30.072 --> 00:12:41.957]  But Newsweek knows full well that in the rant I did that they edited down and only took clips out of to make a video, that I gave specifics of where they were saying it in quadruplicate.
[00:12:41.957 --> 00:12:53.082]  In that very breakdown, I gave four major leaders saying, we're getting ready to remove him and we're not talking about impeachment, sudden removal, physical removal, neutralization.
[00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:59.064]  And again, I don't want to make this about, see I was right here, see I was right there.
[00:12:59.064 --> 00:13:00.946]  You need to know why we're under attack.
[00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:10.154]  Because if our talking points get picked up early, instead of folks finding out we're right a week later, a month later, a year later, ten years later, the globalists don't have a hope or a prayer.
[00:13:10.154 --> 00:13:11.635]  Because I'm not that smart.
[00:13:11.635 --> 00:13:17.361]  Their operations are very, keyword, formulaic.
[00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:18.782]  Formulaic.
[00:13:22.517 --> 00:13:27.341]  Just like in the comedy movie Talladega Nights, he makes his buddy always block the other car so he wins.
[00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:29.143]  He goes, shake and bake!
[00:13:29.143 --> 00:13:30.104]  Formulaic.
[00:13:30.104 --> 00:13:32.546]  You do this, you lose, I win.
[00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:37.230]  Formulaic means all you need to add is milk to this pancake mix.
[00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.454]  It's already got the eggs, the flour, everything else is in there.
[00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:43.776]  You just add milk, stir it up, shake and bake.
[00:13:45.458 --> 00:14:04.433]  So I'm sitting here watching formulas, reading WikiLeaks where they say we're going to hide racial division worldwide, religious division, Muslim against Muslim, Shiite against Sunni, Catholic against Orthodox, Jew against Arab, vice versa, and we're going to use that to control everybody.
[00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:09.837]  So then when I see the very usual suspects doing it,
[00:14:12.446 --> 00:14:16.095]  And carrying it out, I know what's going to happen.
[00:14:16.095 --> 00:14:17.157]  I'm not smart.
[00:14:20.319 --> 00:14:25.320]  When I go fishing and I throw in an orange worm and I don't catch a bass, I go to another worm.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.661]  Wow, they're biting on purple worms today with green tails.
[00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:30.121]  It's little things like that in life.
[00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:32.262]  Like, I'm gonna put out supplements.
[00:14:32.262 --> 00:14:38.083]  I'm gonna go find the biggest, best, highest quality, highest rated companies and get them to private label for me.
[00:14:38.083 --> 00:14:45.005]  That way I learn everything they've done over 30, 40 years, get all their credibility, get all their quality under my name.
[00:14:45.005 --> 00:14:45.205]  Wow.
[00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:55.328]  And then the New York Times, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed wonders why our supplements are some of the top sellers in the country now and funding a revolution.
[00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:57.449]  Because I went to the quality.
[00:14:57.449 --> 00:15:00.130]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.632]  It's just very frustrating to know we're right.
[00:15:04.632 --> 00:15:06.212]  And to know we can stop these people.
[00:15:06.212 --> 00:15:14.335]  Julian Assange came out and said, you know, I wonder why the media is not covering that our government funded white supremacists
[00:15:16.138 --> 00:15:34.269]  To actually burn down hundreds of buildings, kill thousands of people, shoot police by the hundreds, and overthrow the elected government four years ago in Ukraine, and then they put in a Nazi government that actually piles Hitler.
[00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:37.611]  The vice president, but it's beyond Hitler.
[00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:41.594]  They show women with electric bolts shooting out of their fingers.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:50.227]  And then the leaders get up and literally say, hail their party, and do the fascist salute.
[00:15:50.227 --> 00:15:52.449]  That's who our government put in.
[00:15:52.449 --> 00:15:57.936]  But because it's Obama doing it, it's cute.
[00:15:57.936 --> 00:16:00.119]  Gee, they got real Nazis in Ukraine, folks.
[00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:04.103]  The West was occupied by the Germans in World War II because they invited the men.
[00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:07.973]  The East is mainly Orthodox and Russian.
[00:16:07.973 --> 00:16:11.095]  The West is Protestant and Christian.
[00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:13.616]  And so they invited the Nazis in.
[00:16:13.616 --> 00:16:27.204]  Well, our government overthrew the Ukrainian government and actually put real Nazis in.
[00:16:27.204 --> 00:16:30.085]  And that's what Assange is pointing out.
[00:16:30.085 --> 00:16:34.108]  He's saying, you think 50 white nationalists bumbling around
[00:16:35.677 --> 00:16:39.538]  And then Soros people show up, and death ensues.
[00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:42.078]  This is just the media hyping us for division.
[00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:50.300]  If our government cared about fighting racism, it wouldn't have put literal Heil Hitler Nazis in power.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.461]  Overthrown a government!
[00:16:54.461 --> 00:17:00.263]  So, reporter, McElway, police were called off when violence started.
[00:17:00.263 --> 00:17:02.063]  They said, we're leaving, it's too dangerous.
[00:17:04.195 --> 00:17:06.696]  Here's the New York Times saying the same thing.
[00:17:06.696 --> 00:17:18.643]  Riot police open up with flashbang grenades and pepper spray as anti-fascist protesters who hit them with silly string as thousands gather in cities across America in solidarity.
[00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:21.944]  Yeah, the media, mainstream media always makes the anti-fascists sound like good guys.
[00:17:21.944 --> 00:17:25.226]  They throw urine, they throw feces, they throw bottles at you.
[00:17:25.226 --> 00:17:29.348]  And all over the country they got beat up or arrested because there wasn't anybody there for them to protest.
[00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:30.809]  They came out to protest the police!
[00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:37.289]  Because remember, that's how the government started all these riots in the last five, six years.
[00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:57.328]  Funding Justice Department protests to go out and blame the police every time there's a questionable shooting and to make the anti-police stuff an anti-white thing to foment this giant race-based movement to then stir up what's left of white nationalists and people to get them back out on the streets to have a replay of the 1960s.
[00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:14.449]  And if you play along with this, if you're a white nationalist, or a black nationalist, or any of you people, you're morons.
[00:18:14.449 --> 00:18:18.750]  Now, let's go over some of this.
[00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.651]  Let's show for TV viewers a huge exhibit of fake news.
[00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:23.832]  This is CNN.
[00:18:23.832 --> 00:18:25.172]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:18:26.291 --> 00:18:35.337]  Here is the CNN headline, Saturday evening, Trump once again fails to condemn the alt-right white supremacist.
[00:18:35.337 --> 00:18:36.758]  Here is the tweet he put out.
[00:18:36.758 --> 00:18:39.701]  Oh, they also had articles saying he responded slowly.
[00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:47.666]  He gave a press conference within two hours, incredibly fast, and he tweeted while it was going on 1219 noon.
[00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:51.089]  I mean, the thing started at like 1130 Eastern.
[00:18:54.255 --> 00:18:55.856]  So, there you go.
[00:18:55.856 --> 00:18:57.397]  Trump once again fails to condemn.
[00:18:57.397 --> 00:18:59.058]  Here's his actual tweet.
[00:18:59.058 --> 00:19:04.281]  We must all be united and condemn all that hate stands for.
[00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:06.922]  There is no place for this kind of violence in America.
[00:19:06.922 --> 00:19:10.324]  Let's come together as one.
[00:19:10.324 --> 00:19:11.785]  That's a Martin Luther King statement.
[00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:15.687]  A modern Antifa university statement is, Whites are inherently bad.
[00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:17.028]  Western journalism's bad.
[00:19:17.028 --> 00:19:18.109]  Culture's bad.
[00:19:18.109 --> 00:19:19.850]  Free market's bad.
[00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.570]  Kill the Whites.
[00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.171]  Don't let the Whites go to school.
[00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:23.272]  Whites are inherently bad.
[00:19:25.188 --> 00:19:28.573]  If your last name's Lynch, you're in trouble, because that reminds us of lynching.
[00:19:28.573 --> 00:19:31.076]  Change the names of buildings from Lynch.
[00:19:31.076 --> 00:19:32.538]  Attack words.
[00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:33.800]  Attack mother and father.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.721]  Attack families.
[00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:37.264]  Attack culture.
[00:19:37.264 --> 00:19:41.390]  It's just a bunch of people wanting power, running around finding new things to be upset about.
[00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:49.988]  So here's CNN caught in massive, massive, massive, massive fake news.
[00:19:49.988 --> 00:19:53.751]  And the very same CNN said, Jones claims the police stood down.
[00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:56.674]  Jones claims Soros funds these groups.
[00:19:56.674 --> 00:19:59.677]  Jones claims that the Antifa is hateful.
[00:19:59.677 --> 00:20:05.303]  In fact, they had the Homeland Security spokesman on CNN Sunday.
[00:20:05.303 --> 00:20:06.885]  I played the clip yesterday on the Sunday show.
[00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:12.494]  And he was saying, well obviously both groups came looking for trouble, but we condemn all the hate.
[00:20:12.494 --> 00:20:14.056]  We condemn the white supremacists.
[00:20:14.056 --> 00:20:18.819]  And the host goes, Jake Tapper, he goes, you don't condemn the white supremacists?
[00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:25.284]  And just kept saying it, saying it, like his viewers are crazy.
[00:20:25.284 --> 00:20:32.630]  Because they're just totally beside themselves wanting racial and cultural division.
[00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.611]  So there's their fake news.
[00:20:35.814 --> 00:20:38.596]  And of course it was George Soros' birthday on Saturday.
[00:20:38.596 --> 00:20:40.197]  We should add that.
[00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:41.477]  Here's Julian Assange.
[00:20:41.477 --> 00:20:42.998]  Julian Assange asked why the U.S.
[00:20:42.998 --> 00:20:48.361]  said nothing when Obama supported Ukrainian neo-Nazis.
[00:20:48.361 --> 00:20:53.144]  Julian Assange, he's a bigger picture behind America's hypocrisy and double standards.
[00:20:53.144 --> 00:20:54.125]  They use race.
[00:20:54.125 --> 00:20:55.706]  That's not double standards.
[00:20:55.706 --> 00:20:57.647]  They're using cultural differences.
[00:20:57.647 --> 00:21:01.189]  Religious, ethnic, geographic.
[00:21:01.189 --> 00:21:03.130]  It's standard Roman divide and conquer.
[00:21:05.302 --> 00:21:06.663]  So that's some of the news on that front.
[00:21:06.663 --> 00:21:16.970]  I wanted to show you what Paul said last year on November 22nd, just right after the election.
[00:21:18.171 --> 00:21:20.533]  He said there are two alt-rights.
[00:21:20.533 --> 00:21:22.834]  One is more accurately described as the new right.
[00:21:22.834 --> 00:21:24.155]  That's the name.
[00:21:24.155 --> 00:21:25.416]  Or the real right.
[00:21:25.416 --> 00:21:29.859]  These people like to make America great hats, create memes, and have fun.
[00:21:29.859 --> 00:21:32.861]  They include whites, blacks, Asians, Latinos, gays, and everyone else.
[00:21:32.861 --> 00:21:35.243]  These are the people who helped Trump win the election.
[00:21:35.243 --> 00:21:43.209]  The other faction likes to fester in dark corners of subreddits and obsess about Jews, racial superiority, and Adolf Hitler.
[00:21:44.158 --> 00:21:46.038]  This is a huge fringe minority.
[00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:47.759]  They have no impact on the election.
[00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:52.360]  Guess which faction the media is giving all the attention to?
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.941]  And that sums every bit of it up.
[00:21:54.941 --> 00:22:07.264]  If you want a Rosetta Stone, a key to understand this, what are they going to do when they tried to say the Tea Party was racist and tried to make minorities feel like they couldn't be part of free market and prosperity?
[00:22:08.137 --> 00:22:09.858]  They failed under Trump.
[00:22:09.858 --> 00:22:17.805]  They sent mobs of people, women and minorities, it's in the WikiLeaks, to try to get beat up on camera to make Trump look racist.
[00:22:17.805 --> 00:22:19.867]  It didn't fully work.
[00:22:19.867 --> 00:22:25.411]  Record numbers of Hispanics and blacks voted for Trump and the system goes, what are we going to do?
[00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:28.654]  We're going to invoke race as hardcore as we can.
[00:22:28.654 --> 00:22:35.719]  And if Donald Trump divorced his wife and married a black lady, if Donald Trump would have shot the guy that ran over,
[00:22:36.687 --> 00:22:43.371]  The poor lady in Charlottesville, they would have said the caliber of the gun wasn't big enough or something.
[00:22:43.371 --> 00:22:48.554]  And that's a statement from Mike Huckabee on Fox.
[00:22:48.554 --> 00:22:49.495]  We'll play that clip later.
[00:22:49.495 --> 00:22:50.856]  It's totally true.
[00:22:50.856 --> 00:22:54.618]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:56.059]  So that's what they're doing.
[00:22:56.059 --> 00:23:00.762]  And we've got all that linked up on a new site we've launched that loads really quick and is really clean.
[00:23:00.762 --> 00:23:03.124]  We're about to add a lot of new features to it very, very soon.
[00:23:03.124 --> 00:23:04.745]  And that's News Wars.
[00:23:05.748 --> 00:23:09.629]  Newswars.com chronicling the ongoing news wars.
[00:23:09.629 --> 00:23:12.550]  A lot of content there that's exclusive.
[00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:22.954]  The New Yorker magazine came out over the weekend and said that they are planning to forcibly remove Trump in the next two months, exactly as they've been saying in other statements, but this is more crystallized.
[00:23:22.954 --> 00:23:25.034]  And the article is up on newswars.com.
[00:23:25.034 --> 00:23:26.695]  It is an exclusive article.
[00:23:27.675 --> 00:23:30.056]  And is very, very important.
[00:23:30.056 --> 00:23:34.077]  NewsWars.com is a lot less of a big site.
[00:23:34.077 --> 00:23:35.638]  That is, it's not as graphic.
[00:23:35.638 --> 00:23:36.478]  It's more clean.
[00:23:36.478 --> 00:23:37.679]  It loads very, very quickly.
[00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:42.500]  We're going to redesign InfoWars similar to this in the near future, but there is NewsWars.com.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:49.343]  We're also going to launch a meme site that will have contributors, but also a big posting area for you on the front page.
[00:23:49.343 --> 00:23:51.604]  You'll be able to post right to the front page.
[00:23:51.604 --> 00:23:55.225]  And feeds of our own memes and material and comedy.
[00:23:55.965 --> 00:23:59.728]  I'm going to really not have any comedy on this broadcast because the media always takes it and says it's serious.
[00:23:59.728 --> 00:24:10.034]  I'm going to have to start doing it under, I think, even a gnome diplom or a pen name so that we can have the comedy, have the satire, but be totally clear that it's on a whole separate platform.
[00:24:10.034 --> 00:24:12.136]  Comedy will be done there.
[00:24:12.136 --> 00:24:14.517]  Pure seriousness will be done here.
[00:24:14.517 --> 00:24:16.639]  You notice I used to do comedy maybe once every couple weeks.
[00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:25.305]  I don't do it anymore because there's a lot of really dumbed down people and the media takes it and then says that this is what we really believe.
[00:24:26.425 --> 00:24:40.468]  And I understand they're not going to stop doing that, but it'll be even clearer that it's all on that platform, and I'll be doing it under pure characters, in costume, so that it's very hard for them to misrepresent it to their victim viewers.
[00:24:40.468 --> 00:24:43.889]  If you are a mainstream TV viewer or reader, you are a victim.
[00:24:43.889 --> 00:24:46.950]  They are victimizing you, they are predatory.
[00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.311]  Again, their own WikiLeaks admit all of that.
[00:24:49.311 --> 00:24:50.391]  Meanwhile, we're all fighting
[00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:59.924]  Over the complete synthetic garbage of a couple hundred black people being possibly killed wrong every year by police.
[00:24:59.924 --> 00:25:04.449]  We have thousands being killed every year by other black people in Chicago and nothing being said about it.
[00:25:05.131 --> 00:25:25.662]  And again, they took all that, made it racial, made it that white people wanted to kill black people, exploded the myth, created incredible class division in America, and then wonder why tiny groups of white people began behaving like the brainwashed leftist whites that are communist trained at the universities who know what they're doing.
[00:25:25.662 --> 00:25:28.503]  They teach in the classes how they're doing it.
[00:25:28.503 --> 00:25:33.986]  They're invoking racial consciousness in the minority groups for racial conflict.
[00:25:35.148 --> 00:25:37.449]  They are the ultimate.
[00:25:37.449 --> 00:25:43.811]  David Duke couldn't do one one hundredth of what CNN and MSNBC have done.
[00:25:43.811 --> 00:25:45.791]  Just like they funded the Arab Spring.
[00:25:45.791 --> 00:25:46.492]  They pushed that.
[00:25:46.492 --> 00:25:51.813]  They pushed the Ukraine overthrow using Nazis.
[00:25:51.813 --> 00:25:53.414]  They know they're doing it.
[00:25:53.414 --> 00:25:55.014]  They're a hundred percent.
[00:25:55.014 --> 00:25:58.135]  Jake Tapper, all these people know.
[00:25:58.135 --> 00:25:59.136]  They sit in meetings.
[00:25:59.136 --> 00:26:00.476]  They've got scripts.
[00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:03.797]  They're hardcore evil, evil, evil people.
[00:26:05.526 --> 00:26:08.667]  And you've got to understand that.
[00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:14.289]  It's the bottom line and they're trying to invoke this because North Korea can launch missiles at any time at Guam.
[00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:15.249]  Trump could respond.
[00:26:15.249 --> 00:26:16.550]  It could go to nuclear war.
[00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:22.692]  Top analysts are in the news today saying this could be the beginning of World War III and Russia and China need to get behind the U.S.
[00:26:22.692 --> 00:26:26.213]  striking North Korea because North Korea is genuinely out of control now.
[00:26:27.762 --> 00:26:32.185]  The Rothschilds helped set up modern China, helped us put Mao Zedong in.
[00:26:32.185 --> 00:26:39.170]  Now Lord Rothschild, richest man on earth, has come out and said North Korea needs regime change.
[00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:45.975]  Elite Banker speaks out on U.S.-North Korean conflict.
[00:26:45.975 --> 00:26:53.560]  Now I don't want to sit here and agree with Lord Rothschild, but I mean Kim Jong-un has nuclear weapons, has missiles, and is completely out of his mind.
[00:26:56.633 --> 00:26:57.833]  Kim Jong-il was not.
[00:26:57.833 --> 00:26:58.774]  His father was not.
[00:26:58.774 --> 00:27:05.495]  This is a real rogue regime that we appeased, that our governments gave nuclear weapons to.
[00:27:05.495 --> 00:27:07.336]  The Clintons, again.
[00:27:07.336 --> 00:27:08.416]  What about evil?
[00:27:08.416 --> 00:27:09.776]  Nuclear weapons.
[00:27:09.776 --> 00:27:11.177]  Missiles to deliver it.
[00:27:11.177 --> 00:27:14.097]  That's the globalists.
[00:27:14.097 --> 00:27:16.358]  Who caused the Arab Spring that killed over a million people?
[00:27:16.358 --> 00:27:17.378]  The globalists.
[00:27:17.378 --> 00:27:19.298]  Who is funding and financing all this?
[00:27:19.298 --> 00:27:24.780]  I want to go out to break before we have this flotilla of amazing guests today.
[00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:40.911]  With a clip of reporter for Fox News, Doug McKelvey, breaking down exactly what Millie Weaver and our reporters reported in the video we saw and what we covered first on Saturday and Sunday.
[00:27:42.145 --> 00:27:43.246]  Now here's the difference.
[00:27:43.246 --> 00:27:45.727]  He was there live and reported this too.
[00:27:45.727 --> 00:27:55.272]  Fox is as bad as CNN and MSNBC now, pushing the narrative, acting like the white supremacist started it all, acting like Antifa are a bunch of angels.
[00:27:55.272 --> 00:27:58.954]  When I watched that Saturday and Sunday, it was shocking.
[00:27:58.954 --> 00:28:04.096]  Now they're not as bad today because people didn't buy it, but this is real deception.
[00:28:04.096 --> 00:28:09.359]  And they tried to act like the president didn't care because he pointed out that both sides were being bad.
[00:28:11.766 --> 00:28:18.491]  And I just showed you CNN saying he would not condemn it, when word for word he condemned all hate and all racism.
[00:28:18.491 --> 00:28:20.072]  Word for word!
[00:28:20.072 --> 00:28:23.535]  And he said it in his statement!
[00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:27.217]  But they would have edited pieces saying, look he never said it, and only show part.
[00:28:27.217 --> 00:28:30.700]  That is incredible deception!
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.242]  That is unprecedented lying!
[00:28:33.242 --> 00:28:35.043]  That is dangerous!
[00:28:35.043 --> 00:28:36.224]  They are bad people!
[00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:39.876]  They're not just haha, CNN, you know, the idiots.
[00:28:39.876 --> 00:28:41.436]  They're evil!
[00:28:41.436 --> 00:28:42.796]  They're liars!
[00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:45.797]  They are systematically evil!
[00:28:45.797 --> 00:28:47.437]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:28:47.437 --> 00:28:55.419]  We are now beginning to hear criticism bubble up on all sides of this event about the initial slow response by the police.
[00:28:55.419 --> 00:29:06.241]  When I got out of my car yesterday in Charlottesville for the first time at about 10.30 yesterday morning, you knew this was a bad scene and that bad things were going to be happening because people were congregating at Lee Park, at Emancipation Park.
[00:29:07.161 --> 00:29:11.644]  Wearing helmets, body armor, carrying big heavy sticks.
[00:29:11.644 --> 00:29:14.626]  Nobody was intent upon peace here from either side.
[00:29:14.626 --> 00:29:17.527]  People were intent on causing havoc and causing damage.
[00:29:17.527 --> 00:29:22.370]  And even as wounded were being brought out of the park, the police were sitting idly by.
[00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.753]  I was standing by a cordoned off area where the police had set up as a staging area.
[00:29:26.753 --> 00:29:28.994]  The state police had set up and they said, you can come in here.
[00:29:28.994 --> 00:29:30.435]  This is a safe area.
[00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.716]  But when the tear gas started to fly, thrown
[00:29:32.756 --> 00:29:35.579]  They stood down, and that's the only truthful Fox Report I saw.
[00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:03.084]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[00:30:03.084 --> 00:30:09.269]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:18.216]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in a ripple effect.
[00:30:18.436 --> 00:30:20.857]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[00:30:20.857 --> 00:30:24.719]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[00:30:24.719 --> 00:30:28.421]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:31.803]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[00:30:31.803 --> 00:30:40.367]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth.
[00:30:40.367 --> 00:30:41.828]  Such as global warming, for example.
[00:30:42.028 --> 00:30:51.212]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[00:30:51.212 --> 00:30:57.714]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[00:30:57.714 --> 00:30:58.895]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:30:59.275 --> 00:31:01.156]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:01.156 --> 00:31:03.178]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:03.178 --> 00:31:05.979]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:05.979 --> 00:31:12.163]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.163 --> 00:31:19.508]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[00:31:19.648 --> 00:31:21.330]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:28.880]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:36.909]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of its toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:37.931]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.076 --> 00:31:43.018]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.018 --> 00:31:46.600]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:53.303]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:53.303 --> 00:31:57.465]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[00:31:59.594 --> 00:32:05.379]  Today I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:11.465]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force.
[00:32:11.465 --> 00:32:13.947]  And we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[00:32:13.947 --> 00:32:20.793]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply.
[00:32:20.913 --> 00:32:21.394]  We're good to go.
[00:32:39.935 --> 00:32:41.156]  Don't know much about history
[00:33:07.383 --> 00:33:35.872]  Don't know much biology Don't know much about a science book Don't know much about the French I took But I do know that I love you And I know that if you love me too What a wonderful world this would be Don't know much about geography Don't know much trigonometry
[00:33:36.874 --> 00:33:41.062]  You don't know much about George Soros and racial destabilization, do you?
[00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:49.237]  You don't know much about being a schmuck, or being conned, or being a sucker, being a duke, being a useful idiot, being a pawn, being a minion.
[00:33:51.104 --> 00:33:54.106]  By the way, Fox News has got another press conference.
[00:33:54.106 --> 00:33:55.227]  They just said it during the break.
[00:33:55.227 --> 00:33:56.909]  I was getting some extra coffee.
[00:33:56.909 --> 00:34:01.552]  And they were saying this gives him a chance to come out and actually condemn the racism.
[00:34:01.552 --> 00:34:03.494]  He didn't do that last time.
[00:34:03.494 --> 00:34:12.381]  Even Fox was just doing what CNN did when he clearly condemned it and said we should love each other and we should come together.
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:15.697]  And that he condemns all racism.
[00:34:15.697 --> 00:34:17.218]  I showed you the tweets.
[00:34:17.218 --> 00:34:18.479]  I've played the video.
[00:34:18.479 --> 00:34:19.720]  For TV viewers, here it is.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.001]  This is a CNN headline.
[00:34:21.001 --> 00:34:24.884]  Trump once again fails to condemn the alt-right white supremacist.
[00:34:24.884 --> 00:34:26.065]  CNN.
[00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:27.026]  Right here.
[00:34:27.026 --> 00:34:29.748]  This is 12-19 in the middle of the melee.
[00:34:29.748 --> 00:34:33.391]  We all must be united and condemn all that hate stands for.
[00:34:33.391 --> 00:34:35.913]  There is no place for this kind of violence in America.
[00:34:35.913 --> 00:34:37.394]  Let's come together as one.
[00:34:39.784 --> 00:34:42.565]  I cannot think of a better statement than that.
[00:34:42.565 --> 00:34:53.009]  In that very same CNN article, they play an edited clip of him only saying, violence on both sides, and not saying I condemn racism of any kind, and we all must come together.
[00:34:53.009 --> 00:34:55.310]  They even edit that.
[00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.610]  They are so despicable.
[00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.651]  But even Fox, which is
[00:35:00.418 --> 00:35:02.218]  The Globals are taking over.
[00:35:02.218 --> 00:35:05.779]  They're getting rid of everybody at Fox.
[00:35:05.779 --> 00:35:07.060]  You can see it on the shows.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:12.601]  They are just very quickly now turning into CNN.
[00:35:12.601 --> 00:35:16.022]  I walked in this morning and Dermot Brinkman was just shaking his head and he said, you ought to see Fox now.
[00:35:16.022 --> 00:35:17.462]  And I said, no, I've been watching it.
[00:35:17.462 --> 00:35:18.362]  He goes, it's incredible.
[00:35:18.362 --> 00:35:20.363]  It's as bad as CNN.
[00:35:20.363 --> 00:35:22.123]  But there's still people like Hannity.
[00:35:24.114 --> 00:35:35.716]  People like Doug McKelvey, that will actually tell you what they saw, just like we reported, the police said, we've been ordered to stand down, you've got to leave, and then forced our reporters through the gauntlet.
[00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:41.437]  We reported that, it's even barely on the audio, there's all the screaming, you can hear the cops telling Millie Weaver that.
[00:35:41.437 --> 00:35:47.579]  The video's up on InfoWars.com, and what does Time Magazine, what is Newsweek, what does the Washington Times say?
[00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:48.919]  They say I'm a liar.
[00:35:49.864 --> 00:35:51.727]  The police didn't stand down.
[00:35:51.727 --> 00:35:55.592]  Oh, the mayor, Michael Singer, he didn't stand down.
[00:35:55.592 --> 00:35:59.096]  Oh, Alex has a conspiracy theory that people stand down.
[00:35:59.096 --> 00:36:01.860]  Remember in Baltimore, Maryland?
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.585]  It came out the police were ordered to stand down to get the riots going.
[00:36:07.346 --> 00:36:10.548]  Then another person dies in custody, and then there's more riots.
[00:36:10.548 --> 00:36:31.502]  And then they were ordered to stand down in all these different cities that are Democrat-controlled so they can get the riot going, so they can give Antifa a chance to feel emboldened, to be more violent nationwide, and to let them know you can attack people and nothing will happen until somebody drives a car into the crowd.
[00:36:31.502 --> 00:36:32.843]  Is what they did right?
[00:36:32.843 --> 00:36:34.064]  Absolutely not.
[00:36:34.064 --> 00:36:36.286]  Is it right to hit somebody in the head with a bike lock that can kill them?
[00:36:38.231 --> 00:36:39.252]  Is it synthetic?
[00:36:39.252 --> 00:36:46.595]  I don't know, but the whole atmosphere, the whole background, is synthetic.
[00:36:46.595 --> 00:36:52.358]  And it's all selling the idea, should we allow assemblies anymore, of the alt-right.
[00:36:52.358 --> 00:37:01.002]  And they take the term alt-right that Hillary and Podesta created nine months ago, and call everybody that supports freedom and low taxes and sovereignty,
[00:37:02.196 --> 00:37:07.001]  And who cares about our veterans, and who cares about religious freedom, and who doesn't want radical Islam taking over.
[00:37:07.001 --> 00:37:13.768]  That's the alt-right, she says, and then they define alt-right as the Nazis.
[00:37:13.768 --> 00:37:18.873]  And we predicted that was coming, and that's exactly what they're doing, and it's how they operate.
[00:37:18.873 --> 00:37:22.417]  Let's play a clip from Doug McKelvey, who was there.
[00:37:23.531 --> 00:37:24.771]  ...and causing damage.
[00:37:24.771 --> 00:37:29.673]  And even as wounded were being brought out of the park, the police were sitting idly by.
[00:37:29.673 --> 00:37:37.795]  I was standing by a cordoned off area where the police had set up as a staging area, the state police had set up, and they said, you can come in here, this is a safe area.
[00:37:37.795 --> 00:37:43.837]  But when the tear gas started to fly, thrown by protesters, the police themselves began to evacuate that.
[00:37:43.837 --> 00:37:46.178]  I asked the guy who was in charge, I said, where are you going?
[00:37:46.178 --> 00:37:47.518]  He said, we're leaving.
[00:37:47.518 --> 00:37:48.519]  It's too dangerous.
[00:37:48.519 --> 00:37:52.220]  They had an opportunity to nip this thing in the bud, and they chose not to.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.882]  So that's right after the riots started.
[00:37:55.882 --> 00:37:56.742]  We're still ongoing.
[00:37:56.742 --> 00:38:01.225]  That's right when Trump had already tweeted saying he absolutely decries any form of racism.
[00:38:01.225 --> 00:38:02.185]  We've all got to come together.
[00:38:02.185 --> 00:38:03.226]  We've got to love each other.
[00:38:03.226 --> 00:38:06.728]  Because it's not enough to say, you know, racism is bad.
[00:38:06.728 --> 00:38:11.191]  If you're not going to be racist, if you're going to be racist, just be racist and just be that way.
[00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:20.557]  But if you're going to come together, love each other and love our good attributes and love our cultures and come together about what we stand for and what we produce,
[00:38:21.536 --> 00:38:28.517]  As I've said a thousand times, if you've got the best taste in food, I don't care if you're black, asian, hispanic, white.
[00:38:28.517 --> 00:38:30.758]  If you've got good food and you're nice, I'm gonna come over there.
[00:38:30.758 --> 00:38:32.518]  It's like I don't care what color you are.
[00:38:32.518 --> 00:38:35.979]  You're a good looking woman, you're nice, I'm not married, whatever.
[00:38:35.979 --> 00:38:38.639]  Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes and colors.
[00:38:38.639 --> 00:38:41.199]  But if you've got a chip on your shoulder, an attitude problem, I don't like you.
[00:38:41.199 --> 00:38:44.960]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.940]  It's the same thing for music.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.301]  I like white music, black music, fusion music.
[00:38:50.427 --> 00:38:56.209]  I don't like the way wild sound and kind of new modern Arabic music sounds mixed in with the old-fashioned and the new.
[00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:58.210]  That's some wild stuff.
[00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.511]  I got one of those channels on my iPhone.
[00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:06.352]  I'll be listening to weird Middle Eastern music, Kurdish music, because I like it.
[00:39:06.352 --> 00:39:09.694]  But I don't want to be told I'm inherently bad because I'm white.
[00:39:09.694 --> 00:39:16.716]  That's complete racism and that's what's pushed on the colleges to create the white backlash, to create the segregation.
[00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.812]  To create the balkanization, to create the control.
[00:39:20.812 --> 00:39:22.194]  Let's put it back on screen again.
[00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:25.797]  Fox News, CNN, they're all getting ready for another speech.
[00:39:25.797 --> 00:39:32.242]  Trump could come out and say, you know, he wants to execute anybody that's, no, he's talking now.
[00:39:32.242 --> 00:39:34.284]  Let's go to the President.
[00:39:34.284 --> 00:39:38.748]  Companies are moving back to the United States and bringing many thousands of jobs.
[00:39:38.748 --> 00:39:42.451]  See, he hijacks their race baiting to bring us together around the economy.
[00:39:42.451 --> 00:39:45.153]  We have already created over one million jobs.
[00:39:46.104 --> 00:39:48.326]  Since I took office.
[00:39:48.326 --> 00:39:53.451]  We will be discussing economic issues in greater detail later this afternoon.
[00:39:53.451 --> 00:39:54.652]  I love how he hijacks it.
[00:39:54.652 --> 00:40:12.768]  But based on the events that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, I would like to provide the nation with an update on the ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everyone.
[00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:21.148]  I just met with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[00:40:21.148 --> 00:40:32.993]  The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly car attack that killed one innocent American and wounded 20 others.
[00:40:34.855 --> 00:40:42.747]  To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable.
[00:40:42.747 --> 00:40:44.610]  Justice will be delivered.
[00:40:45.971 --> 00:40:56.800]  As I said on Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.683]  It has no place in America.
[00:41:00.683 --> 00:41:09.371]  And as I have said many times before, no matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws.
[00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:12.794]  We all salute the same great flag.
[00:41:13.889 --> 00:41:20.035]  And we are all made by the same Almighty God.
[00:41:20.035 --> 00:41:30.484]  We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence.
[00:41:30.484 --> 00:41:37.171]  We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.
[00:41:37.171 --> 00:41:38.232]  Racism is evil.
[00:41:39.221 --> 00:41:55.446]  And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.
[00:41:55.446 --> 00:42:01.967]  We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal.
[00:42:01.967 --> 00:42:05.088]  We are equal in the eyes of our Creator.
[00:42:05.088 --> 00:42:06.869]  We are equal under the law.
[00:42:07.649 --> 00:42:12.253]  And we are equal under our Constitution.
[00:42:12.253 --> 00:42:19.060]  Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:24.825]  Two days ago, a young American woman, Heather Heyer, was tragically killed.
[00:42:24.825 --> 00:42:31.011]  Her death fills us with grief and we send her family our thoughts, our prayers, and our love.
[00:42:32.213 --> 00:42:41.077]  We also mourn the two Virginia State Troopers who died in service to their community, their commonwealth, and their country.
[00:42:41.077 --> 00:42:55.424]  Troopers Jay Cullen and Burke Bates exemplify the very best of America, and our hearts go out to their families, their friends, and every member of American law enforcement.
[00:42:55.424 --> 00:42:59.286]  These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency
[00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:01.867]  Of our nation.
[00:43:01.867 --> 00:43:17.534]  In times such as these, America has always shown its true character, responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.
[00:43:17.534 --> 00:43:26.958]  As a candidate, I promise to restore law and order to our country, and our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge.
[00:43:27.998 --> 00:43:36.842]  We will spare no resource in fighting so that every American child can grow up free from violence and fear.
[00:43:36.842 --> 00:43:54.650]  We will defend and protect the sacred rights of all Americans and we will work together so that every citizen in this blessed land is free to follow their dreams in their hearts and to express the love and joy in their souls.
[00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:59.294]  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
[00:43:59.294 --> 00:44:00.035]  Thank you very much.
[00:44:11.708 --> 00:44:18.870]  The KKK neo-Nazis saying we must unite against hatred, bigotry, and violence.
[00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:23.171]  It was unexpected that these remarks would be coming from the White House so quickly.
[00:44:23.171 --> 00:44:25.692]  He said hate on all sides last time.
[00:44:25.692 --> 00:44:27.692]  You have to mention every group.
[00:44:27.692 --> 00:44:33.094]  So that's something that keeps spinning and even Fox, see right before they went on, he hadn't condemned it, he didn't condemn it.
[00:44:33.094 --> 00:44:36.575]  So we've got to, it's the lies of these people.
[00:44:36.575 --> 00:44:37.715]  But here's the big takeaway.
[00:44:39.281 --> 00:44:40.502]  This isn't rhetoric.
[00:44:40.502 --> 00:44:41.542]  Think about this.
[00:44:41.542 --> 00:44:50.345]  The mayor, the dirtbag, globalist, social engineer, literally under Soros and Hillary's control, 80% of the town voted for Hillary.
[00:44:50.345 --> 00:44:57.948]  Michael Singer ordered the police stand down, and the blood is on his hands.
[00:44:57.948 --> 00:45:02.350]  And the police, who a lot of times aren't the villain when folks say, they are the villain.
[00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:03.791]  They were villains at the
[00:45:04.915 --> 00:45:05.815]  Inauguration.
[00:45:05.815 --> 00:45:13.238]  I was there watching women and children and men beat up by tens of thousands of thugs at the entrances to the mall.
[00:45:13.238 --> 00:45:18.039]  I couldn't get in for hours.
[00:45:18.039 --> 00:45:20.280]  And the police sat there and watched it.
[00:45:21.664 --> 00:45:25.125]  Because they were run by the Democrat dirtbags.
[00:45:25.125 --> 00:45:28.786]  So yeah, the police are definitely bad in Democrat cities.
[00:45:28.786 --> 00:45:31.266]  They are 100% bad.
[00:45:31.266 --> 00:45:32.286]  And that's been my experience.
[00:45:32.286 --> 00:45:36.627]  It's always Democrat cities where the cops are drug dealers and corrupt, like Chicago.
[00:45:36.627 --> 00:45:38.568]  Not all of them, but a lot of them.
[00:45:38.568 --> 00:45:43.389]  And it's the same thing in these dirtbag towns, where the big city machine runs things.
[00:45:43.389 --> 00:45:44.989]  The police stand down.
[00:45:44.989 --> 00:45:47.310]  They let the thug communists attack people.
[00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:48.110]  It's what they do.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.002]  And they're despicable.
[00:45:51.002 --> 00:45:54.085]  That mayor is despicable.
[00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:57.308]  Even in Seattle, when the Antifa attacked the cops, they did something.
[00:45:57.308 --> 00:46:00.170]  Antifa even attacked cops in Charlottesville.
[00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.892]  They did nothing.
[00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:04.835]  They followed their criminal orders.
[00:46:04.835 --> 00:46:11.682]  And it's despicable to protect a group that calls for their own murder.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:24.865]  See, the police are being used as pawns in all this, like they're the reason there's racism in America, or that cops inherently are all bad, when most of them are just working a job, a tough job.
[00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:27.027]  But I tell you, it's true.
[00:46:27.027 --> 00:46:33.150]  I've been in these Democrat cities, and I've witnessed it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:46:34.269 --> 00:46:37.412]  And that Virginia State Trooper thing is real weird.
[00:46:37.412 --> 00:46:42.957]  How do you know some anti-fah, anti-cop groups didn't shoot that helicopter out of the sky with a machine gun or something?
[00:46:42.957 --> 00:46:51.005]  And it's being covered up because they want to use this as much as they can to demonize the libertarian constitutional movements nationwide and worldwide.
[00:46:51.005 --> 00:46:55.569]  Now, Millie Weaver's been holding for 15 minutes because we had that Trump announcement.
[00:46:55.569 --> 00:46:57.331]  We're going to go to her in just a moment, but first off,
[00:46:59.713 --> 00:47:05.116]  I told you that last month's specials were the biggest we've ever had with the largest number of products.
[00:47:05.116 --> 00:47:15.023]  And I'm just getting more and more into sales because folks love it and you respond so well that we're able to still operate and fund ourselves and lower prices.
[00:47:15.023 --> 00:47:17.284]  And we are calling it now the BuzzFeed special.
[00:47:17.284 --> 00:47:20.066]  It's last month's specials and the 1776 specials of this month.
[00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:29.324]  Hands down the biggest specials we have ever offered in my 22 years on air.
[00:47:29.324 --> 00:47:30.728]  The BuzzFeed Special!
[00:47:32.555 --> 00:47:40.183]  Is last month's and this month's specials all together at once, and many items have free shipping.
[00:47:40.183 --> 00:47:43.727]  All items have free shipping on orders of $50 or more.
[00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:46.590]  Brain Force Plus, 55% off.
[00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:50.194]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen, especially with all this nuclear war talk.
[00:47:50.194 --> 00:47:50.815]  Everybody should have it.
[00:47:50.815 --> 00:47:52.517]  This is the purest form of iodine.
[00:47:52.517 --> 00:47:52.897]  Secret 12.
[00:47:54.733 --> 00:48:05.336]  Super high quality iodine that BuzzFeed's analysis said we sell for $12 less than the leading brand that it's private labeled of, and that we have the very best deal in the world.
[00:48:05.336 --> 00:48:14.918]  BuzzFeed tried to attack us and said, totally clean California standards, and we sell the number one B12 in the world.
[00:48:14.918 --> 00:48:17.339]  Their analysis had to admit, okay, it's true.
[00:48:22.552 --> 00:48:23.392]  Excuse me.
[00:48:23.392 --> 00:48:24.372]  It's hilarious.
[00:48:24.372 --> 00:48:27.473]  They didn't know that part until they said, this is the best B-12 example, $35.
[00:48:27.473 --> 00:48:32.254]  Theirs is just pure B-12, totally clean, but it should be, you know, a lot less.
[00:48:32.254 --> 00:48:36.915]  When ours was $17.76 and theirs was $35, the exact same one, private label by us.
[00:48:36.915 --> 00:48:38.616]  Oh boy, that's delicious.
[00:48:38.616 --> 00:48:39.916]  The irony of that is incredible.

[00:49:59.093 --> 00:50:01.796]  Little bit in with Gary Haven in studio.
[00:50:01.796 --> 00:50:06.440]  We've got Mike Cernovich with huge inside intel from the White House and the ongoing shakeups there.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:12.406]  Diamonds and Silt getting ready to sue YouTube and Google for censoring them, calling them racist, for supporting Trump.
[00:50:12.406 --> 00:50:14.528]  They're two great black ladies.
[00:50:14.528 --> 00:50:16.790]  We'll be able to talk about the latest stuff that's happening as well.
[00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:18.812]  Jason Kessler, who organized the
[00:50:19.913 --> 00:50:31.481]  national white thing that just blew up everybody's face and we've got Owen Schreier and we've got the Indian American who dressed up like a black guy so he got into medical school when he couldn't as an Indian.
[00:50:31.481 --> 00:50:34.764]  They're even discriminating against Asians folks and it's just it's wrong.
[00:50:34.764 --> 00:50:36.405]  It's wrong to do it to anybody.
[00:50:36.405 --> 00:50:37.546]  Show, Infowars

[00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:22.684]  Should I fall out of love, my fine line?
[00:54:26.092 --> 00:54:30.842]  Coming up, Gary Haber just really spearheaded a move.
[00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:39.894]  To point out that an EMP could be used to knock out our electrical grid or an electromagnetic pulse from the sun and it's a real danger.
[00:54:39.894 --> 00:54:43.717]  Trump had a national drill last week for dark skies.
[00:54:43.717 --> 00:54:47.380]  That article is at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.080]  Very, very important.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:48.801]  Drugs linked to it.
[00:54:48.801 --> 00:54:55.565]  We're going to republish it to the front page of NewsWars here in the next few minutes so folks can find it easily with some updates.
[00:54:55.565 --> 00:54:58.367]  And Millie Weaver will ride shotgun with us a little bit in the next hour.
[00:54:58.367 --> 00:55:00.489]  Mr. Haben will ride shotgun into the next hour as well.
[00:55:00.489 --> 00:55:01.790]  We've got a flotilla
[00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.830]  of guests.
[00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:04.732]  But Milley, totally vindicated.
[00:55:04.732 --> 00:55:06.293]  Fox News reporter was there.
[00:55:06.293 --> 00:55:11.437]  He said the police were ordered to stand down, that they are responsible for not doing their duty.
[00:55:11.437 --> 00:55:14.059]  I mean, it's their duty to do that.
[00:55:14.059 --> 00:55:17.202]  They didn't, obviously, because the Democrat mayor ordered them to.
[00:55:17.202 --> 00:55:19.804]  This has been the ongoing pattern in Democrat cities.
[00:55:19.804 --> 00:55:20.724]  You got pepper sprayed.
[00:55:20.724 --> 00:55:22.386]  Gavin got pepper sprayed.
[00:55:22.386 --> 00:55:25.688]  Now they're trying to blame Trump, saying he didn't respond strong enough.
[00:55:25.688 --> 00:55:29.191]  I think he certainly did, and they're guilty of fake news yet again.
[00:55:30.751 --> 00:55:44.178]  Well you know Alex, I'm 100% convinced now, after hearing the mainstream media coverage, hearing Trump's response to it, that this 100% was a deep state operation.
[00:55:44.178 --> 00:55:46.078]  It was essentially a trap.
[00:55:46.078 --> 00:55:51.881]  Now I'm sure the original people who planned this Unite the Right rally protest did so with
[00:55:53.582 --> 00:55:56.443]  With good intentions, so to speak.
[00:55:56.443 --> 00:56:03.224]  And I do think some of the more extremist elements on the right kind of hijacked that, jumped on board.
[00:56:03.224 --> 00:56:16.388]  But all in all, the mayor, the government officials, the police, the mainstream media was hyping this event up prior to it even happening, encouraging elements on the extreme left to come out.
[00:56:16.388 --> 00:56:17.768]  Antifa, Black Lives Matter.
[00:56:18.488 --> 00:56:24.452]  And it was essentially a trap because as soon as the police and everyone were there, the police stood down.
[00:56:24.452 --> 00:56:25.373]  They didn't do their job.
[00:56:25.373 --> 00:56:27.094]  They did not keep the peace.
[00:56:27.094 --> 00:56:32.418]  It almost reminded me of that movie The Purge because it was all out anarchy.
[00:56:32.418 --> 00:56:35.360]  And could you imagine if a city mayor just decided,
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:43.503]  I just decided to say that the police can stand down all today and all crime can be committed and we're just going to stand out and watch it.
[00:56:43.503 --> 00:56:51.347]  That's essentially what they did here at this protest and it was pretty terrifying and I will say this, you know the media is
[00:56:52.641 --> 00:56:53.602]  I was there.
[00:56:53.602 --> 00:57:01.368]  A lot of the people that were there witnessed that the Antifa came out and they committed violence.
[00:57:12.316 --> 00:57:31.398]  Now, the people on the alt-right side, some of them had bigoted views, and people on the new right, or Trump supporters, have all said that this is horrible, we do not agree with racism, we do not agree with their beliefs, but all in all, this is just being used to try and demonize Trump supporters and demonize
[00:57:32.058 --> 00:57:32.759]  We're good to go.
[00:57:48.613 --> 00:57:48.913]  I don't
[00:58:07.532 --> 00:58:12.154]  It was for the most part contained because the police did their jobs.
[00:58:12.154 --> 00:58:13.095]  They didn't stand down.
[00:58:13.095 --> 00:58:14.976]  They didn't allow chaos to happen.
[00:58:14.976 --> 00:58:23.800]  And the Antifa were clashing violently with the police, spraying them with silly spray in their riot gear masks so that they couldn't see.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:28.642]  And they in turn then got pepper sprayed by the police because they were trying to go and attack people.
[00:58:28.642 --> 00:58:29.202]  Absolutely.
[00:58:29.202 --> 00:58:36.086]  You can say the police in Charlottesville basically aided, we're about to go to break, but basically aided the rioters.
[00:58:36.086 --> 00:58:36.426]  We'll be back.
[00:58:38.703 --> 00:58:42.226]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:42.226 --> 00:58:49.071]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.071 --> 00:58:53.735]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:58:53.735 --> 00:59:04.584]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much
[00:59:04.704 --> 00:59:04.964]  I think?
[00:59:22.762 --> 00:59:23.262]  We're good.
[00:59:51.368 --> 00:59:58.391]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.391 --> 01:00:10.315]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:12.936]  Because there is a war on, on your mind.
[01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:23.889]  Well, desperate elites, when they come in and take control of populations, they cause division.
[01:00:23.889 --> 01:00:27.472]  It's a standard British Empire, Roman Empire operation.
[01:00:27.472 --> 01:00:32.256]  Millie Weaver was there with our intrepid cameraman, Gavin.
[01:00:32.256 --> 01:00:39.723]  Other observations about what you witnessed, Millie, now that they confirm that the police were ordered to stand down in Charlottesville, Virginia.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:01:00.618]  Well, basically, one of the observations there is that you could see that the people on the alt-right Unite the Rally side brought a lot of shields and whatnot and things to block themselves with, whereas the Antifa brought cases full of water balloons filled with urine, feces, paint, gels.
[01:01:01.398 --> 01:01:04.099]  Uh, pepper spray, tear gas canisters.
[01:01:04.099 --> 01:01:09.962]  They brought things to throw at them, to attack them with, and that's kind of what happened all in all.
[01:01:09.962 --> 01:01:12.603]  Um, I'm not saying that there weren't scuffles, there weren't fights.
[01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:13.904]  Of course fights break out.
[01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:17.446]  You can pepper spray someone in the face and then their friends are going to attack you.
[01:01:17.446 --> 01:01:18.446]  That's what happened.
[01:01:18.446 --> 01:01:26.310]  But the police stood down so that it could happen, so that they could use this violence that went down to say that it was all the
[01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:34.873]  People on the alt-right, it was all these white supremacists, white nationalists, so that then you could then blame it all on Trump supporters.
[01:01:34.873 --> 01:01:50.359]  And that's why Trump had to then inevitably come out and condone, so harshly he condoned the people on the alt-right, whereas he didn't make much mention out of Antifa and the Black Lives Matter groups that were actually going out there to create that situation.
[01:01:50.359 --> 01:01:53.981]  And I do believe that these groups are backed and paid for by George Soros,
[01:01:54.501 --> 01:02:10.348]  And this is all a way to try and create an extremist movement on the alt-right and to have some of these alt-right goons continue to have these protests so that they can then play into the narrative by having these hate groups come out, attack them,
[01:02:11.088 --> 01:02:16.933]  Police stand down, allow the fighting to continue, then only blame all the violence on the alt-right.
[01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:34.967]  So the smartest solution here would be simply, you know, I get that you want to have these protests, I get that it is your right to have these protests, but I would say really and truly try to refrain from some of these protests and rallies for a little while because they are literally using
[01:02:35.407 --> 01:02:36.428]  Well, Millie, you're right.
[01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:04.741]  You're right.
[01:03:04.741 --> 01:03:06.742]  That's exactly what's happening here.
[01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:13.125]  And the left gets turned loose to attack, kill police, attack whites everywhere, say whites deserve to die.
[01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:15.546]  Countless knockout game deaths, you name it.
[01:03:15.546 --> 01:03:20.809]  And then white people see that and think, well, we're really under attack on a racial basis.
[01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:22.410]  I guess the white supremacists were right.
[01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:23.690]  We better go join them.
[01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:25.151]  That's the manipulation.
[01:03:25.151 --> 01:03:28.813]  And then they have these Democrat Party cities where the police stand down.
[01:03:29.853 --> 01:03:32.155]  So they can have a more explosive event.
[01:03:32.155 --> 01:03:39.320]  And as you pointed out, the Antifa comes out with the weapons, with the clubs, with the tear gas, with it.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.262]  And then the white nationals, they have their shields.
[01:03:42.262 --> 01:03:44.544]  And I'm not saying the white nationals are good.
[01:03:44.544 --> 01:03:48.107]  Clearly, though, they're not the ones that initiated the violence.
[01:03:48.107 --> 01:03:57.974]  And then you have the police standing down and then ordering you and the press to go back through the Antifa and letting them attack you, actually aiding and abetting through the mayor's action.
[01:03:58.594 --> 01:04:06.441]  The violence of the death, so I believe that Michael Singer should be charged with the murder as a co-conspirator with the individual that ran her over.
[01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:17.231]  I think Michael Singer is part of a capital murder operation and premeditatedly new violence would come and is guilty of capital murder and should be tried and should be sent to death row.
[01:04:18.661 --> 01:04:24.232]  Exactly, because he allowed for chaos to ensue and anarchy to go on.
[01:04:24.232 --> 01:04:25.775]  He could have endangered the whole city!
[01:04:25.775 --> 01:04:29.201]  This could have become a nationwide chain reaction of idiots killing each other.
[01:04:30.197 --> 01:04:31.738]  White, black, I don't care what color you are.
[01:04:31.738 --> 01:04:32.738]  Stop it!
[01:04:32.738 --> 01:04:34.418]  Stop being idiots!
[01:04:34.418 --> 01:04:39.480]  We're being hit with chemicals, GMOs, globalism, geoengineering, World War III stuff.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.841]  This is dumb!
[01:04:40.841 --> 01:04:41.901]  We're all in this together.
[01:04:41.901 --> 01:04:42.941]  We need to have an economy.
[01:04:42.941 --> 01:04:43.821]  We need to have a future.
[01:04:43.821 --> 01:04:47.143]  We need to work together for prosperity, like Trump's saying.
[01:04:47.143 --> 01:04:48.683]  Millie Weaver, stay there.
[01:04:48.683 --> 01:04:50.804]  And we've got big guests coming in the studio as well.
[01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:51.184]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.702 --> 01:04:57.124]  Why is the fungus?
[01:04:57.124 --> 01:04:58.205]  Why is the mold?
[01:04:58.205 --> 01:04:59.948]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:04:59.948 --> 01:05:00.929]  What is going on?
[01:05:00.929 --> 01:05:01.670]  What has changed?
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:17.305]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[01:05:17.305 --> 01:05:19.086]  It's available at infomorestore.com.

[01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:25.091]  Please!

[01:05:27.412 --> 01:05:28.433]  I want to get your reviews.
[01:05:28.433 --> 01:05:29.374]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:05:29.374 --> 01:05:30.855]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:05:30.855 --> 01:05:35.379]  MycoZX, antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[01:05:35.379 --> 01:05:36.099]  Get it today.
[01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:36.680]  Limited run.

[01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:42.745]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:42.745 --> 01:05:46.108]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.430]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:49.831]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:05:49.831 --> 01:05:51.772]  We're changing the world together.
[01:05:51.772 --> 01:05:52.793]  You are the Infowar.
[01:05:52.793 --> 01:05:53.554]  God bless you all.
[01:05:55.510 --> 01:06:00.973]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:00.973 --> 01:06:03.074]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:03.074 --> 01:06:08.357]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:08.357 --> 01:06:12.119]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:06:12.219 --> 01:06:15.640]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.840]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.701]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:22.701 --> 01:06:29.883]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:29.883 --> 01:06:36.024]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[01:06:36.184 --> 01:06:37.586]  Nanosilver and more.
[01:06:37.586 --> 01:06:45.877]  Due to a request from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:54.188]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:06:55.399 --> 01:07:04.488]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:12.897]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:12.897 --> 01:07:17.562]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:17.762 --> 01:07:24.547]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:24.547 --> 01:07:31.732]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:31.732 --> 01:07:38.577]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:38.737 --> 01:07:43.220]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:46.622]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:46.622 --> 01:07:52.926]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:07:52.926 --> 01:07:54.867]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[01:08:05.555 --> 01:08:13.557]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:21.559]  We are now beginning to hear criticism bubble up on all sides of this event about the initial slow response by the police.
[01:08:21.559 --> 01:08:32.441]  When I got out of my car yesterday in Charlottesville for the first time at about 10 30 yesterday morning, you knew this was a bad scene and that bad things were going to be happening because people were congregating at Lee Park, at Emancipation Park,
[01:08:33.363 --> 01:08:37.886]  Wearing helmets, body armor, carrying big heavy sticks.
[01:08:37.886 --> 01:08:40.908]  Nobody was intent upon peace here from either side.
[01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:43.830]  People were intent on causing havoc and causing damage.
[01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:48.733]  And even as wounded were being brought out of the park, the police were sitting idly by.
[01:08:48.733 --> 01:08:53.156]  I was standing by a cordoned off area where the police had set up as a staging area.
[01:08:53.156 --> 01:08:55.397]  The state police had set up and they said, you can come in here.
[01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.878]  This is a safe area.
[01:08:56.878 --> 01:08:59.360]  But when the tear gas started to fly, thrown by
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.243]  And that's the Fox Reporter!
[01:09:15.458 --> 01:09:16.600]  Kidding it right!

[01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:29.380]  We're about to add a lot of new features to it.
[01:09:30.536 --> 01:09:34.359]  And there's going to be an app associated with it that's free as well.
[01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:37.262]  So a lot of stuff coming to newswars.com.
[01:09:37.262 --> 01:09:40.885]  As we chronicle the news wars, we have CNN yesterday.
[01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.126]  They're still saying it.
[01:09:42.126 --> 01:09:43.387]  That's the talking point.
[01:09:43.387 --> 01:09:44.228]  It's Fox News.
[01:09:44.228 --> 01:09:45.889]  It's the talking point.
[01:09:45.889 --> 01:09:49.472]  Once again, Trump condemns.
[01:09:49.472 --> 01:09:53.156]  Once again, Trump fails to condemn the alt-right white supremacist.
[01:09:53.156 --> 01:09:57.439]  Once again, when did he not do it?
[01:09:57.439 --> 01:09:58.000]  The first time.
[01:09:59.901 --> 01:10:04.103]  Oh, because he only condemned David Duke like 20, 30 times back in the 90s and again and again and again.
[01:10:04.103 --> 01:10:07.685]  They wanted to force him into an issue to condemn David Duke.
[01:10:07.685 --> 01:10:11.247]  Does he have to condemn black supremacists when they say something?
[01:10:11.247 --> 01:10:20.092]  I mean, how is it him, every time something happens, he's supposed to... He gave a press conference within like an hour and a half of this happening Saturday, and they said, oh, that wasn't quick enough.
[01:10:20.092 --> 01:10:24.314]  But while it was going on at 12.19 Eastern, it was going on at 11.19 Central.
[01:10:24.314 --> 01:10:25.615]  It was over by, you know, 12.30 or so.
[01:10:29.645 --> 01:10:35.770]  We must, we must all be united and condemn all that hate stands for.
[01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:38.111]  There's no place for this kind of violence in America.
[01:10:38.111 --> 01:10:40.233]  Let's come together as one.
[01:10:40.233 --> 01:10:43.315]  Then he said, no matter what color you are, we've all got to love each other.
[01:10:43.315 --> 01:10:45.617]  They turned that into he didn't condemn it.
[01:10:45.617 --> 01:10:53.023]  So he came out particularly and said, okay, KKK, whoever was there, horrible people.
[01:10:53.023 --> 01:10:54.143]  Then they'll say he never said it.
[01:10:54.143 --> 01:10:55.825]  They'll probably say again, just like they did with the,
[01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:59.792]  The whole David Duke thing is, why won't you condemn it?
[01:10:59.792 --> 01:11:07.536]  He would be in press conferences and condemn it three times in 15 minutes, and then they'd come back and say, why haven't you condemned it?
[01:11:07.536 --> 01:11:10.818]  And he just said, you're getting a soundbite for CNN fake news.
[01:11:10.818 --> 01:11:13.179]  I just said it two minutes ago.
[01:11:13.179 --> 01:11:14.980]  And finally they backed off.
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:18.462]  But you can see it's the same old bag of tricks.
[01:11:18.462 --> 01:11:26.167]  Gary Haven, successful Texan, billionaire founder of Curves and many other businesses, big philanthropist, the guy that helped break
[01:11:27.601 --> 01:11:33.163]  The news with our reporters last year, flying in a day after the hurricane of the child sex rings run by the UN.
[01:11:33.163 --> 01:11:37.645]  That was then confirmed about six months later in a big report by the Associated Press.
[01:11:37.645 --> 01:11:43.727]  He's the producer of the hit film, Amerageddon, that yours truly, Zen, that's focused on dark skies events.
[01:11:43.727 --> 01:11:46.748]  Oh guys, can you reprint me that article from last week, why I wanted him on?
[01:11:46.748 --> 01:11:48.228]  I forgot to ask for that.
[01:11:48.228 --> 01:11:49.709]  Our big story that was on Drudge.
[01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:50.729]  Thank you, sir.
[01:11:50.729 --> 01:11:51.769]  Dealing with the dark skies.
[01:11:51.769 --> 01:11:52.990]  There is a black sky event.
[01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:56.011]  Fed's prepping for widespread power outages across the U.S.
[01:11:56.011 --> 01:12:00.413]  We're going to get into that too, but Gary, I haven't asked your opinion on this, but you're a really smart guy.
[01:12:00.413 --> 01:12:06.415]  That's why I've asked you to come in once every week if you want, especially once we launch these new shows, or once every month.
[01:12:06.415 --> 01:12:09.236]  Whenever you want the doors open, just call Nico.
[01:12:09.236 --> 01:12:22.062]  I'd like you to host your own show once a week remotely if you wanted to, because you've always got really great connections in the Republicans, in the state, in law enforcement, in business, and really important angles on what's going on.
[01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:26.463]  And you've helped spur a national debate about these dark sky events.
[01:12:26.463 --> 01:12:31.845]  We're going to cover more, and Millie's going to have some final comments in a moment, but you'll be co-hosting with me today, the next few hours.
[01:12:31.845 --> 01:12:35.046]  We have a lot of other guests on, but what do you want to tackle first?
[01:12:35.046 --> 01:12:41.969]  The President's new response saying, unequivocally, love each other, don't be racist, come together, I condemn these racist groups.
[01:12:41.969 --> 01:12:43.249]  I mean, he did what they wanted.
[01:12:43.249 --> 01:12:46.370]  He didn't condemn the Antifa communists and their violence.
[01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:51.412]  He went so far as to go, okay, just the white nationalists, they're bad, we condemn it.
[01:12:51.952 --> 01:12:56.595]  Which is them really bullying him into that, when previously he gave the real statement.
[01:12:56.595 --> 01:12:57.516]  Both sides are dumb.
[01:12:57.516 --> 01:12:57.976]  They're bad.
[01:12:57.976 --> 01:12:58.716]  Racism's bad.
[01:12:58.716 --> 01:12:59.537]  Condemn it all.
[01:12:59.537 --> 01:13:00.297]  Let's love each other.
[01:13:00.297 --> 01:13:01.538]  Let's get the economy going.
[01:13:01.538 --> 01:13:02.279]  Let's move forward.
[01:13:02.279 --> 01:13:04.220]  He tried to neutralize it all.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:04.960]  They don't want that.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.383]  They want CNN to have him, but they're not going to stop now.
[01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:10.604]  They're going to keep saying, you didn't condemn, you didn't condemn.
[01:13:10.604 --> 01:13:11.885]  He'll say, I just condemned again.
[01:13:11.885 --> 01:13:14.667]  He'll have to have press conference after press conference, Gary.
[01:13:15.509 --> 01:13:17.691]  Yeah, let's start there.
[01:13:17.691 --> 01:13:26.980]  You know, kind of the hidden message here is when Trump made his statement, he did not simply go after the so-called white supremacists.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:31.104]  He said it was inclusive because he saw what Milley has been talking about.
[01:13:31.644 --> 01:13:39.587]  He saw these Antifa, violent, probably bust-in, Soros-funded people.
[01:13:39.587 --> 01:13:44.849]  And to Trump's credit, he had the courage to include them in his statement.
[01:13:44.849 --> 01:13:48.091]  And of course, that's what set him up for them to go after him.
[01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:50.252]  So I really commend Trump for having done that.
[01:13:50.252 --> 01:13:58.115]  And by the way, Miller, you've done a spectacular job on covering this, and the courage you have to walk into that crowd is amazing.
[01:13:58.955 --> 01:14:08.461]  And the one thing I want to add to this is what Trump needs to do is to order the Justice Department to follow the money.
[01:14:08.461 --> 01:14:11.222]  Soros has probably paid for these people.
[01:14:11.222 --> 01:14:12.483]  He admittedly pays for all the groups.
[01:14:12.483 --> 01:14:17.806]  Yeah, and it's easy to find because you know you can go to... In fact, Milley's going to have a report out today with Gavin.
[01:14:17.806 --> 01:14:20.268]  They actually caught the same faces as other parts of the country.
[01:14:20.268 --> 01:14:23.330]  Yes, crisis actors have been funded to be there.
[01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:24.810]  Now that's easy to establish.
[01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:25.631]  The report's going to show that.
[01:14:25.931 --> 01:14:26.272]  Excellent.
[01:14:26.272 --> 01:14:27.393]  I didn't even know you, okay.
[01:14:27.393 --> 01:14:27.913]  Yeah.
[01:14:27.913 --> 01:14:30.256]  Stay one step ahead of us.
[01:14:30.256 --> 01:14:33.079]  Well, if he can show that link, guess what?
[01:14:33.079 --> 01:14:37.744]  George Soros needs to be charged and arrested for sedition.
[01:14:37.744 --> 01:14:39.066]  That's where this thing needs to go.
[01:14:40.971 --> 01:15:00.361]  I want Millie to speak to that because first they hire them for these riot control drills, the cops don't know, the antifa is being trained at those, paid like $300 a day in many cases, as crisis actors they learn how to hit, attack, fight, they drill, then they're bused out, they're sent out to kind of lead and agitate folks that just kind of show up on their own.
[01:15:01.081 --> 01:15:03.582]  And so that's what you've got is this domino effect.
[01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:06.602]  But undoubtedly, Trump was on target.
[01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.963]  We have the mayor admittedly ordering a stand down.
[01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:10.804]  We have the police confirming they were ordered to stand down.
[01:15:10.804 --> 01:15:12.724]  That's anarchy.
[01:15:12.724 --> 01:15:14.505]  A dereliction of duty.
[01:15:14.505 --> 01:15:15.825]  That's aiding and abetting this.
[01:15:15.825 --> 01:15:16.925]  And that's what Trump's talking about.
[01:15:16.925 --> 01:15:19.406]  So I think they should go for the death penalty for the guy.
[01:15:20.481 --> 01:15:24.625]  I believe he should be given the punishment after the jury declares that he's guilty of capital murder.
[01:15:45.319 --> 01:15:51.622]  Yes, and Trump needs to actually tell the rest of the story, and explain it.
[01:15:51.622 --> 01:15:55.264]  Instead, he's backed down, and he's gone on defense again.
[01:15:55.264 --> 01:15:56.844]  He needs to go on offense.
[01:15:56.844 --> 01:16:00.306]  He has the truth on his side, and there's plenty of evidence, and so what?
[01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:03.267]  The media is going to be shooting him down anyway.
[01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:08.510]  At least the American people will be able to step in and defend him, because we'll know what's really going on.
[01:16:09.474 --> 01:16:10.315]  It's just incredible.
[01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:13.198]  He came out and said, I totally condemn all forms of racism.
[01:16:13.198 --> 01:16:13.678]  It's horrible.
[01:16:13.678 --> 01:16:14.439]  We should love each other.
[01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:15.620]  We should come together.
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:17.362]  But both sides came looking for a fight.
[01:16:17.362 --> 01:16:19.024]  It all needs to be investigated.
[01:16:19.024 --> 01:16:26.471]  Of course it needs to be investigated when you're given a speech two hours after it happened and people are still bleeding.
[01:16:26.471 --> 01:16:31.316]  I mean, again, we finally got a president that doesn't just go with whatever CNN tells him to say.
[01:16:32.532 --> 01:16:40.558]  And Trump, he steps out with one foot, like his statement on this, and then he backs up and goes on defense.
[01:16:40.558 --> 01:16:45.561]  He needs to forget trying to please these people and step out there.
[01:16:45.561 --> 01:16:47.222]  That's what got him elected.
[01:16:47.222 --> 01:16:51.265]  And why he's not doing that now as a follow through.
[01:16:51.265 --> 01:16:55.088]  It's because all over the White House they're saying Bannon leads these people.
[01:16:55.088 --> 01:16:56.629]  Bannon's criticizing McMaster.
[01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:58.250]  Bannon doesn't run anything at Breitbart.
[01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:08.576]  It's been the organic research about McMaster being in the Soros group and trying to sabotage things that organically my listeners were saying day one back in April.
[01:17:08.576 --> 01:17:10.677]  Why aren't you on McMaster more?
[01:17:10.677 --> 01:17:12.218]  Why aren't you defending Flynn more?
[01:17:12.218 --> 01:17:13.119]  And I said, I don't know.
[01:17:13.119 --> 01:17:14.279]  Let's wait and see.
[01:17:14.279 --> 01:17:16.281]  It was the listeners that do the research.
[01:17:16.281 --> 01:17:18.062]  It was the 4chan people.
[01:17:18.062 --> 01:17:19.482]  It was the autistic army.
[01:17:19.482 --> 01:17:21.584]  And that's not bashing autistic kids if you're a new listener.
[01:17:21.584 --> 01:17:25.246]  That's what they call themselves because they're like Ashbergers at fighting on the Internet.
[01:17:25.786 --> 01:17:26.066]  I don't know.
[01:17:48.749 --> 01:17:55.056]  Just a few weeks ago, I said, listen, if Scaramucci has all this info, they're going to get mad at him for leaking.
[01:17:55.056 --> 01:17:57.599]  If he's the leak investigator, they're going to turn it around.
[01:17:57.599 --> 01:18:03.646]  We've got to learn that info from the patriots in the White House to fight the globalists is not a leak.
[01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:04.507]  That is news.
[01:18:05.589 --> 01:18:12.431]  But they're gonna label it as leaks, and they got Scaramucci that way, and now they're going, well, look, the alt-right knows all this, it must be Bannon.
[01:18:12.431 --> 01:18:21.334]  I've never gotten anything from Bannon on my phone other than, you know, keep it up, brother, you know, we're gonna restore the republic, I appreciate your work.
[01:18:21.334 --> 01:18:23.615]  That's all I get, and that's all he'll do.
[01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:26.476]  And the president on the phone, when I get a chance to talk to him, it's the same thing.
[01:18:26.476 --> 01:18:27.776]  It's all being recorded.
[01:18:27.776 --> 01:18:30.797]  So, you know, we're all operating on our own out here, ladies and gentlemen, go ahead.
[01:18:31.647 --> 01:18:41.369]  But you know, you're a great resource as the leader in the alternative media.
[01:18:41.369 --> 01:18:50.812]  If you've not been reached out to from Bannon, then that's evidence to me that... I've got Bannon's phone number right here.
[01:18:50.812 --> 01:18:53.913]  He'll just respond with, oh hey, we're fighting hard.
[01:18:53.913 --> 01:18:54.793]  Hope you're doing well, brother.
[01:18:55.543 --> 01:18:56.003]  That's it.
[01:18:56.003 --> 01:18:58.105]  He will not respond when, hey, what's going on here?
[01:18:58.105 --> 01:18:59.286]  Hey, are you ever going to have a press conference?
[01:18:59.286 --> 01:19:00.387]  Ever going to give an interview?
[01:19:00.387 --> 01:19:02.268]  Hey, I'd like to get you on.
[01:19:02.268 --> 01:19:06.131]  No response since the campaign, other than friendly little things.
[01:19:06.131 --> 01:19:13.176]  So, that's all that goes on since he has been, you know, even the last few months of the campaign, and then President-elect.
[01:19:13.176 --> 01:19:15.018]  He's not giving anyone information.
[01:19:15.018 --> 01:19:15.338]  Zero.
[01:19:16.394 --> 01:19:34.766]  You know, later on when we talk about this North Korea thing, I'm going to give you some insight that's unique, that I think will help explain the Deep State and their agenda, and how the Deep State itself is being trapped by the North Korea program.
[01:19:34.766 --> 01:19:36.847]  But I'm interested to hear what Milley has to say.
[01:19:36.847 --> 01:19:39.449]  We're going to finish up with Milley, final comments from her straight ahead.
[01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:45.814]  And I don't want to bash Scaramucci, but he's telling the president you were dumb to give a real answer.
[01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:47.736]  No, that's what makes the country love you.
[01:19:47.736 --> 01:19:53.060]  The president should double down and go after the racist white supremacists, but also after Soros.
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:54.381]  Yeah, tell the truth.
[01:19:54.381 --> 01:19:55.062]  Tell us the whole story.
[01:19:55.062 --> 01:19:56.243]  Do you trust our economy?
[01:19:56.243 --> 01:19:57.604]  How about our banking system?
[01:19:57.924 --> 01:20:05.129]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now, and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.
[01:20:05.129 --> 01:20:07.490]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now.
[01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:15.736]  There has never been a better time to turn your IRA or 401k into physical gold or silver with GSI Exchange.

[01:24:25.497 --> 01:24:34.924]  Gary was telling me an amazing story about some of his personal friends that are real close to Trump and into the spiritual life of Trump, which I've been told some of the same stories.
[01:24:34.924 --> 01:24:35.765]  This is powerful.
[01:24:35.765 --> 01:24:37.546]  It's coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:24:37.546 --> 01:24:44.751]  We're going to play his response that was live about 30 minutes ago that the media is trying to spin that, oh, it wasn't enough, you know, decrying the racism.
[01:24:45.472 --> 01:24:46.773]  Well, it's just crazy.
[01:24:46.773 --> 01:24:52.818]  It's like this benchmark where they're the boss, you're guilty, and you've got to decry David Duke 50 times.
[01:24:52.818 --> 01:24:54.620]  25 times isn't enough.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:56.701]  It's so transparent.
[01:24:56.701 --> 01:25:00.625]  And that's why George Soros and others have hyped up racial divide in this country.
[01:25:00.625 --> 01:25:03.587]  Millie Weaver, you and Gavin, where are you now?
[01:25:03.587 --> 01:25:04.528]  Where are you going next?
[01:25:04.528 --> 01:25:06.790]  And other observations about what we've witnessed.
[01:25:08.177 --> 01:25:11.679]  Well, right now we're in Ohio and we're continuing on.
[01:25:11.679 --> 01:25:17.283]  Our next stop is actually going to be in Pittsburgh for the March on Google at Google headquarters.
[01:25:17.283 --> 01:25:21.606]  And we will be also talking to people and getting their stories for the Flyover America series.
[01:25:21.606 --> 01:25:24.608]  But I just wanted to say one quick thing on Charlottesville.
[01:25:24.608 --> 01:25:31.752]  Now, when I say that I believe that Deep State was involved in this and that it was run by Deep State, I'm not saying that I think it was a false flag.
[01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:36.956]  I'm not saying that I think that there were crisis actors that were getting hurt or not, you know, pretending to get hurt.
[01:25:37.768 --> 01:25:46.412]  I said that this looks like the Deep State was involved in it because it looked like it was a huge setup in order to demonize the rise of the United States.
[01:25:46.412 --> 01:25:50.174]  Exactly, they created the atmosphere, they created the hype, they've been pushing for it.
[01:25:50.174 --> 01:25:52.515]  Billions of dollars spent the last eight years.
[01:25:52.515 --> 01:25:57.658]  Coordinated police stand down just like they've done in Maryland and other areas.
[01:25:57.658 --> 01:26:02.220]  They stand down to make it as bad as possible and it turns out the Justice Department of Clinton
[01:26:02.721 --> 01:26:05.128]  And Obama and others continue to do this.
[01:26:05.128 --> 01:26:07.516]  So we know there's a major history of this, Millie.
[01:26:07.516 --> 01:26:09.702]  And the stand-down you first reported is confirmed.
[01:26:11.067 --> 01:26:11.587]  Exactly.
[01:26:11.587 --> 01:26:16.930]  And it was just to create anarchy so that you would have Antifa throwing things.
[01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:20.931]  And what's the natural reaction when your bottles are getting thrown at people?
[01:26:20.931 --> 01:26:23.592]  Well, some of them are going to pick them up and throw them back.
[01:26:23.592 --> 01:26:28.114]  And then that's all they need to try and justify, look, see, they're the violent ones.
[01:26:28.114 --> 01:26:29.635]  They're the ones acting out.
[01:26:29.635 --> 01:26:30.875]  Demonize the alt-right.
[01:26:30.875 --> 01:26:31.596]  Demonize them.
[01:26:31.596 --> 01:26:32.796]  Do you condemn them?
[01:26:32.796 --> 01:26:34.217]  Do you disavow them, Trump?
[01:26:34.737 --> 01:26:49.965]  And then kind of get that whole narrative going that you have homegrown terrorism on the alt-right, whereas they don't want to mention Antifa and how Antifa literally came trained, militarized, doing war-like maneuvers.
[01:26:49.965 --> 01:26:53.867]  You know, they bring coolers and you think, oh, it's to stay hydrated.
[01:26:53.867 --> 01:27:00.391]  No, it's filled with water balloons, filled with feces, urine, just disgusting things that will pop and explode on people.
[01:27:00.391 --> 01:27:02.672]  And water bottles filled with the same substances.
[01:27:03.112 --> 01:27:06.417]  You think, oh look, they're bringing Silly Spray like they did in Seattle.
[01:27:06.417 --> 01:27:13.427]  Well, they were Silly Spraying the riot cops so that their masks were covered and they could then mess with their line of sight.
[01:27:13.427 --> 01:27:15.710]  You think, oh look, they're linking arms and singing.
[01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:17.212]  See, they're just trying to be peaceful.
[01:27:17.212 --> 01:27:18.654]  It looks great for a photo op.
[01:27:19.375 --> 01:27:27.159]  But in reality, it's to block people from getting back into where their medics are to wash the spray, the pepper spray off of their face.
[01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:36.125]  So they know how to, I mean, whoever is orchestrating this is very smart and they know exactly what they're doing and they are trying to protect the values of this country.
[01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:37.285]  Well, they train them.
[01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:37.786]  They train them.
[01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:41.087]  It's been in the news at these socialist camps.
[01:27:41.087 --> 01:27:42.928]  They have in Oregon, Illinois.
[01:27:42.928 --> 01:27:44.810]  It's in my film, Police Take to the Takeover.
[01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:48.211]  And what you're saying, Millie, is absolutely what's happening.
[01:27:48.211 --> 01:27:48.732]  First, they
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.502]  Designate everyone who likes Trump as the alt-right.
[01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:55.723]  Because you don't just say all conservatives are racist.
[01:27:55.723 --> 01:27:56.543]  They've already tried that.
[01:27:56.543 --> 01:27:57.083]  It didn't work.
[01:27:57.083 --> 01:28:00.885]  They go, okay, calling all conservatives racist isn't working.
[01:28:00.885 --> 01:28:03.226]  Let's just call them alt-right.
[01:28:03.226 --> 01:28:05.127]  Then is a new definition.
[01:28:05.127 --> 01:28:07.087]  The Democrats will own it and control it.
[01:28:07.087 --> 01:28:15.331]  Then we'll claim that all of Trump's new supporters are racist, have a few racist events, and then connect that to Trump himself.
[01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:17.272]  So this is all semantical games they're playing.
[01:28:18.371 --> 01:28:34.037]  Exactly, and my problem with just coming out and jumping on the bandwagon and saying, you know, bad white nationalists, bad white supremacists, which your views are stupid, I'll say that, you guys are dumb for buying into the narrative.
[01:28:34.037 --> 01:28:40.359]  But you're looking at the larger paradigm, the larger manipulation is the key, and then we ask ourselves, what's coming next?
[01:28:41.279 --> 01:28:44.802]  Soros spent over a billion dollars on this and others spent billions.
[01:28:44.802 --> 01:28:48.765]  They've been getting this race war going for a long time, as I said, would kick off at the end of the summer.
[01:28:48.765 --> 01:28:49.305]  It's here.
[01:28:49.305 --> 01:28:50.086]  So what comes next?
[01:28:51.015 --> 01:28:54.396]  So what comes next is they want retaliation.
[01:28:54.396 --> 01:29:01.659]  They want more people to hold these alt-right rallies so that they can then stage it, create violence, and blame it only on the alt-right.
[01:29:01.659 --> 01:29:03.320]  All I have to say is don't be stupid.
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.860]  Don't buy into that.
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.941]  Get smart.
[01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:06.841]  Sue.
[01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:07.841]  Use petitioning.
[01:29:07.841 --> 01:29:09.622]  Use your means through paper.
[01:29:09.622 --> 01:29:10.542]  Use the courts.
[01:29:10.542 --> 01:29:12.163]  Use the system.
[01:29:12.163 --> 01:29:13.984]  Go out there and become politically active.
[01:29:13.984 --> 01:29:20.466]  Don't fall into the narrative because they are going to use this to demonize Trump at the end of the day, and that is all what this is about.
[01:29:20.726 --> 01:29:21.486]  I agree.
[01:29:21.486 --> 01:29:25.167]  Trump needs to throw the book at anybody that was violent on both sides.
[01:29:25.167 --> 01:29:31.128]  They need to execute the guy that ran the folks over, and then they need to have the Justice Department indict Michael Schenger for aiding and abetting.
[01:29:31.128 --> 01:29:34.669]  I guarantee you his emails have got him with the Soros people, the stand down.
[01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:35.669]  We have them.
[01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:38.009]  If we move against them, Trump must go on the offense.
[01:29:38.009 --> 01:29:44.210]  Millie Weaver, can't wait to see your next live episodes of Fly Over America, right here at InfoWars.com.

[01:30:00.327 --> 01:30:01.308]  What is going on?
[01:30:01.308 --> 01:30:02.068]  What has changed?

[01:30:48.808 --> 01:30:50.688]  Look at the response we're getting.

[01:32:01.484 --> 01:32:04.326]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:32:04.326 --> 01:32:06.308]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:32:06.308 --> 01:32:11.171]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:32:11.331 --> 01:32:13.433]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:32:13.433 --> 01:32:14.714]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:32:14.714 --> 01:32:19.838]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:32:19.838 --> 01:32:26.583]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:32:26.783 --> 01:32:29.645]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.

[01:32:33.387 --> 01:32:40.292]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:32:40.292 --> 01:32:47.817]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[01:33:09.887 --> 01:33:12.570]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:12.570 --> 01:33:17.697]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:30.322 --> 01:33:36.144]  Let's play part of Trump's second statement, which the media is now saying isn't enough.
[01:33:36.144 --> 01:33:37.984]  They're already editing it.
[01:33:37.984 --> 01:33:42.005]  They're already saying Trump declares racism as evil amid pressure over Charlottesville.
[01:33:42.005 --> 01:33:54.068]  All he's ever said for 40 years in public life is unify people, bring people together, getting NAACP awards, decrying David Duke dozens of times on TV before he even ran for president.
[01:33:54.068 --> 01:33:55.549]  Then they would say he hadn't decried him.
[01:33:56.529 --> 01:34:02.411]  You know, wait till on the weekend David Duke had said something and Trump wasn't paying attention and say, oh you need to respond.
[01:34:02.411 --> 01:34:03.491]  He didn't respond today.
[01:34:03.491 --> 01:34:05.852]  He's for David Duke.
[01:34:05.852 --> 01:34:09.313]  Just like they said, oh it's been hours he hasn't responded about Charlottesville.
[01:34:09.313 --> 01:34:16.575]  He tweeted and he said all racism is bad and it was all right here and then he condemned it but they ran fake news that he didn't.
[01:34:16.575 --> 01:34:20.056]  So he tweeted about it, he gave a speech, now another speech that's three times.
[01:34:20.056 --> 01:34:23.117]  I think he's kind of falling into their trap because
[01:34:23.897 --> 01:34:27.440]  Now they're saying get rid of Bannon, that he's behind it all.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.543]  When Bannon's not behind all the attacks on McMaster, that's a fact.
[01:34:30.543 --> 01:34:43.795]  We're going to talk to Mike Cernovich, who's always got the inside intel, with The Medium and of course all the other great work he's doing, best-selling author, just popping in for like 10 minutes and then we've got Diamond and Silk coming on and so much more.
[01:34:44.275 --> 01:34:47.158]  Gary Haven riding shotgun with us.
[01:34:47.158 --> 01:34:51.884]  And we're going to Cernovich in a moment, but just your overall breakdown of this.
[01:34:51.884 --> 01:34:57.210]  And then after Cernovich leaves us, I want to get into the real spiritual side of Trump that nobody knows about.
[01:34:57.210 --> 01:34:57.851]  Very good.
[01:34:57.851 --> 01:34:59.412]  Yeah, let me mention a couple of things.
[01:34:59.412 --> 01:35:01.234]  First of all, this is the same old, same old.
[01:35:02.075 --> 01:35:11.480]  You know, they're getting us caught up in the chatter, Trump good, Trump bad, and we've got to be careful not to waste our time and energy on this thing.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:21.906]  Look, Trump is the hope we have, even though he's struggling, he's the real deal, and all of this is this nonsense about him, the attacks on him.
[01:35:22.486 --> 01:35:29.417]  Whether it's Russian collusion or this or whatever we're going to see next week, it's just nonsense.
[01:35:29.417 --> 01:35:38.089]  The ultimate goal here for the people that control the media, the deep state, the people that are in power, is to create chaos.
[01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:42.271]  You know, out of chaos, they plan to acquire order and power.
[01:35:42.271 --> 01:35:43.892]  And so that's the endgame.
[01:35:43.892 --> 01:35:46.253]  And they've been more and more open about it.
[01:35:46.253 --> 01:35:47.893]  American people are waking up.
[01:35:47.893 --> 01:35:51.195]  Thanks a lot to you, Alex, for what you've done.
[01:35:51.195 --> 01:35:54.116]  We just have to step back and say, OK, who's benefiting from this?
[01:35:54.116 --> 01:35:55.376]  Where is this going?
[01:35:55.376 --> 01:35:57.957]  And spend our time on the things that are important.
[01:35:58.497 --> 01:36:00.039]  We need to get along with each other.
[01:36:00.039 --> 01:36:11.088]  You know, we've got black brothers and sisters that love each other and us and we should work together and not let them separate us and buy into this nonsense.
[01:36:11.088 --> 01:36:19.316]  So everybody needs to calm down and just call the media for the corruption and the lies that they're doing to perpetrate this nonsense.
[01:36:19.956 --> 01:36:20.356]  I don't
[01:36:38.681 --> 01:36:51.106]  And he's saying you've got the white supremacist morons, and you've got the cop-killing anti-fa groups fun about Soros, and then they stir up a fight, and the police with the Democratic mayor orders a stand-down, and innocent people get hurt and killed.
[01:36:51.106 --> 01:36:56.789]  You know, the Nazis are bad, Soros is bad, and by the way, Soros is a former Nazi collaborator.
[01:36:56.789 --> 01:36:59.950]  Julian Assange came out and said, why don't they care that our government under Obama
[01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:04.031]  Funded the overthrow of the Ukrainian government and put Nazis in charge.
[01:37:04.031 --> 01:37:04.431]  Absolutely.
[01:37:04.431 --> 01:37:11.032]  This claim that Trump's a Nazi, when the whole Democrat government's run by Nazis, run by a real Nazi, is incredible.
[01:37:11.032 --> 01:37:12.012]  It's extraordinary.
[01:37:12.012 --> 01:37:29.335]  You know, I don't want to get off topic, but 530 representatives in the Congress voted to extend and broaden the sanctions on Russia based on Russian collusion in the election, which 75% of Americans know is nonsense.
[01:37:30.075 --> 01:37:30.976]  Some polls are higher.
[01:37:30.976 --> 01:37:38.519]  But China put a 30 of 535 that Congress thought punishing, which is an act of war by the way, these sanctions against Russia was a good idea.
[01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:41.241]  Yeah, our representatives are bought and paid for.
[01:37:41.241 --> 01:37:43.662]  And Trump needs to be honest about that as well.
[01:37:43.662 --> 01:37:45.043]  I want to go to North Korea with you.
[01:37:45.043 --> 01:37:47.564]  Mike Cernovich, of course, needs an introduction.
[01:37:47.564 --> 01:37:52.987]  Coming up in early September, he's launching his own broadcast daily, kicking off at 3 o'clock Central.
[01:37:52.987 --> 01:37:55.148]  And he's got a bunch of powerful new articles.
[01:37:55.148 --> 01:37:59.410]  He sent me one this morning that I'm going to pull up here in a second on screen for viewers, so I'll give you the headline.
[01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:04.612]  Where he kind of lays out a menu of the current battle, what's coming next, what his sources are saying.
[01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:07.033]  Everybody knows he really understands what's happening.
[01:38:07.033 --> 01:38:08.654]  He's also a filmmaker, producer.
[01:38:08.654 --> 01:38:11.935]  The new film being produced is Hoax, the media's war on truth.
[01:38:11.935 --> 01:38:19.279]  So we get into the White House battle first, what's happening with the riots, obviously staged, condoned, and allowed.
[01:38:19.279 --> 01:38:22.640]  Just incredible that even Fox News is admitting there was a stand down order.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.001]  Our reporters witnessed it.
[01:38:24.001 --> 01:38:24.941]  Or the North Korea thing.
[01:38:24.941 --> 01:38:26.782]  What do you want to tackle first, Mike Cernovich?
[01:38:28.404 --> 01:38:29.905]  I mean, there's so much to talk about.
[01:38:29.905 --> 01:38:36.471]  I think Trump's statement is a good starting off point because it shows how dishonest the media is.
[01:38:36.471 --> 01:38:40.754]  Trump did everything they wanted him to do, and now they're going, oh, well, it wasn't good enough.
[01:38:40.754 --> 01:38:41.515]  You should have done this.
[01:38:41.515 --> 01:38:43.477]  You should have taken questions.
[01:38:43.477 --> 01:38:44.798]  They're not honest people.
[01:38:44.798 --> 01:38:46.759]  So Trump is losing his way.
[01:38:46.759 --> 01:38:50.683]  Whoever is telling him to dance like a puppet for the media is giving him bad advice.
[01:38:51.553 --> 01:38:52.774]  Because they take that as weakness.
[01:38:52.774 --> 01:38:56.498]  His first statement was, love each other, come together, all racism's bad.
[01:38:56.498 --> 01:38:58.700]  But both sides came looking for a fight.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:38:59.961]  We need to investigate this.
[01:38:59.961 --> 01:39:00.581]  And look!
[01:39:00.581 --> 01:39:03.184]  The New York Times admit there was an order for a stand-down.
[01:39:03.184 --> 01:39:04.765]  That is incredible!
[01:39:04.765 --> 01:39:09.530]  I mean, we had a stand-down in Maryland where they were beating people, the Black Lives Matter.
[01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:10.771]  That's criminal, Cernovich.
[01:39:10.771 --> 01:39:11.572]  What do you think should be done?
[01:39:12.642 --> 01:39:17.345]  Well, yeah, they actually sent the alt-right guys into, and as you know, I have no love for those guys.
[01:39:17.345 --> 01:39:18.206]  I hate you.
[01:39:18.206 --> 01:39:20.327]  But they sent them into kill zones.
[01:39:20.327 --> 01:39:24.850]  So I've actually investigated what had happened and I watched every stream.
[01:39:24.850 --> 01:39:26.031]  So here's what happened.
[01:39:26.031 --> 01:39:28.553]  The alt-right people had a permit.
[01:39:28.553 --> 01:39:29.694]  The Antifa did not.
[01:39:30.254 --> 01:39:39.718]  The police demanded that the alt-right people disperse because Antifa were committing violence and rioting, but the police didn't go after Antifa.
[01:39:39.718 --> 01:39:48.162]  Instead, they sent the alt-right guys into these choke points where they were attacked and it was like melee warfare again, just like the Battle of Berkeley.
[01:39:48.822 --> 01:39:51.666]  And then, of course, violence is always ratcheted up.
[01:39:51.666 --> 01:39:54.609]  There were people in the streets with baseball bats and antifa.
[01:39:54.609 --> 01:39:58.013]  You had massive fighting on both sides.
[01:39:58.013 --> 01:39:59.515]  But this is law enforcement.
[01:39:59.515 --> 01:40:03.059]  If I were the father of the daughter who was murdered, I would definitely be suing
[01:40:03.959 --> 01:40:08.723]  You're a successful lawyer in your own right.
[01:40:08.723 --> 01:40:11.045]  I mean, I'm no lawyer, but this is cut and dry.
[01:40:11.045 --> 01:40:13.607]  They ordered a stand down, the cops admitted it.
[01:40:13.607 --> 01:40:16.849]  They made people march through the gauntlet to put the two sides together.
[01:40:16.849 --> 01:40:19.291]  They were ordered to stand down and make this thing explode.
[01:40:20.359 --> 01:40:21.860]  Yes, and we've seen this happen.
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:24.081]  This happened at a San Jose Trump rally.
[01:40:24.081 --> 01:40:26.282]  It's happened in Chicago.
[01:40:26.282 --> 01:40:30.324]  There's a whole pattern of this, which the fake news media doesn't want to cover.
[01:40:30.324 --> 01:40:33.306]  These stand-down orders are par for the course.
[01:40:33.306 --> 01:40:40.269]  And in fact, that's why those alt-right guys would go into the events wearing shields and helmets and things because... By the way, this just in.
[01:40:40.269 --> 01:40:44.151]  The ACLU, it turns out, also called the police and confirmed it.
[01:40:44.151 --> 01:40:45.732]  They're not even hiding that they stood down.
[01:40:46.929 --> 01:40:47.890]  Mike, what do you think?
[01:41:17.483 --> 01:41:19.204]  You can never show weakness.
[01:41:19.204 --> 01:41:21.126]  You can never apologize.
[01:41:21.126 --> 01:41:23.628]  You can never placate or appease the media.
[01:41:23.628 --> 01:41:25.369]  You have to always double down.
[01:41:25.369 --> 01:41:34.997]  And this is a bad thing for society because they're never going to say, Oh, you know, cause you've done that Alex before where you tried to say, Oh, you know, I, I got that story wrong here.
[01:41:34.997 --> 01:41:36.058]  I'm going to retract it.
[01:41:36.058 --> 01:41:40.101]  And then they go, this proves that Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[01:41:40.101 --> 01:41:43.044]  They keep misrepresenting that before I was ever attacked.
[01:41:43.044 --> 01:41:43.484]  I correct.
[01:41:43.524 --> 01:41:44.165]  We're good to go.
[01:41:54.355 --> 01:42:02.421]  Right, and now they're even trying to say, they're trying to accuse you of anti-semitism when you, I just read Cher Blue and Soros is going after you again.
[01:42:02.421 --> 01:42:10.528]  You've always said you have no time for this nonsense and now they're claiming that you're talking about Jewish stuff and anti-Jewish stuff.
[01:42:10.528 --> 01:42:11.629]  They're really dirty.
[01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:13.490]  Hey Mike, tell me this.
[01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:14.771]  How does Trump handle this?
[01:42:14.771 --> 01:42:16.633]  What does he do in the media to counter this?
[01:42:16.633 --> 01:42:17.053]  What do you think?
[01:42:18.348 --> 01:42:23.050]  Well, Trump made a, his statement today was, didn't move the ball downfield.
[01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:38.035]  What you have to do is you say, I disavow the KKK, I disavow the Nazis, and I call upon the media and the Democrats to disavow the Scalise shooting, the Family Research Council shooting.
[01:42:38.035 --> 01:42:42.636]  I call on them to join our pledge to disavow all political violence.
[01:42:42.636 --> 01:42:44.337]  And then that is how you prevent them.
[01:42:44.337 --> 01:42:45.517]  That's how you have to counterpunch.
[01:42:45.517 --> 01:42:46.938]  You always have to be aggressive.
[01:42:47.558 --> 01:43:07.430]  Even when you're kind of doing what they want and that was his big mistake is he should have said I Demand we all join a joint because who's against the pledge against violence So now you've taken the high road and you're forcing the enemy to assume your frame But instead he went into the frame of the enemy and he got ambushed and as you can see they're just shooting at him even more
[01:43:07.958 --> 01:43:14.384]  You know, when his first statement actually was consistent with what you just said, he said all groups that were involved.
[01:43:14.384 --> 01:43:17.627]  But then he backed up, you know, after they came after him.
[01:43:17.627 --> 01:43:21.190]  By the way, I watched his press event here a few minutes ago.
[01:43:21.190 --> 01:43:24.073]  He did a great job on it, but he's backpedaling now.
[01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:28.537]  Instead of being on offense, he's going to defense that quickly.
[01:43:28.537 --> 01:43:29.118]  What do you think of that?
[01:43:29.918 --> 01:43:36.222]  Well, his statement on Saturday wasn't good because you have to identify the enemy by name.
[01:43:36.222 --> 01:43:38.924]  You can't make a vague proclamation about both sides.
[01:43:38.924 --> 01:43:41.886]  You would have to say, I call on you.
[01:43:41.886 --> 01:43:43.327]  Alex Jones and I did this.
[01:43:43.327 --> 01:43:52.693]  We completely flipped Megyn Kelly and all those lunatics on their heads because we said we disavow all political violence by anybody who reads us or watches us.
[01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:57.076]  We therefore call upon Jake Taper, CNN, Brian Stelter, Megyn Kelly.
[01:43:59.838 --> 01:44:00.611]  Covering up their violence.
[01:44:01.417 --> 01:44:02.398]  Right.
[01:44:02.398 --> 01:44:22.990]  Let me add this, since you mentioned it, since you mentioned it, I pointed out that when I would go protest the Klan and KKK, that clearly sometimes it came out they were federal agents, and sometimes that it was Southern Poverty Law Center groups and ADL and Jewish groups, and it'd be Jewish guys, you know, that don't look very Aryan, but you know, look kind of like Howard Stern type guys, you know, doing it.
[01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:29.313]  And just like they caught the guy attacking the Jewish cemeteries and synagogues, and he was a Jewish left-wing guy.
[01:44:29.313 --> 01:44:30.374]  Now they edited that out.
[01:44:31.144 --> 01:44:31.424]  Okay.
[01:44:31.424 --> 01:44:36.229]  You know, it's like saying if they said a black guy did something and I said, well, I saw a white guy running from the scene.
[01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:40.894]  It wouldn't be that I was being racist against whites saying it looked like a, it's just crazy.
[01:44:40.894 --> 01:44:49.563]  And over and over again, they've caught leftist Jewish groups, just like earlier this year, they wanted Trump to decry attacks on Jewish centers like he was involved in it.
[01:44:50.003 --> 01:44:53.146]  So he said, OK, I decry it, but it could be staged.
[01:44:53.146 --> 01:44:55.408]  I went, oh my gosh, it was fake.
[01:44:55.408 --> 01:44:59.852]  They caught the left-wing Jewish guy who admitted to doing it with accomplices.
[01:44:59.852 --> 01:45:04.516]  So I'm talking about Jewish groups going out as white supremacists, posing as them.
[01:45:04.516 --> 01:45:06.198]  They've been caught over and over again.
[01:45:06.198 --> 01:45:07.179]  The ADL's been caught.
[01:45:07.179 --> 01:45:08.620]  The Southern Primary Law Center's been caught.
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:12.384]  And then they play this game like I'm just making that up.
[01:45:13.184 --> 01:45:14.385]  I just love it.
[01:45:14.385 --> 01:45:14.845]  I love it.
[01:45:14.845 --> 01:45:15.285]  I love it.
[01:45:15.285 --> 01:45:16.186]  Call me anti-Semitic.
[01:45:16.186 --> 01:45:16.566]  I don't care.
[01:45:16.566 --> 01:45:17.407]  You're liars.
[01:45:17.407 --> 01:45:20.048]  It's like calling Trump anti-Semitic when his family's married into Jews.
[01:45:20.048 --> 01:45:21.409]  I don't care.
[01:45:21.409 --> 01:45:23.070]  Nothing against Jews in general.
[01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:23.991]  It's all edited.
[01:45:23.991 --> 01:45:27.893]  Alex Jones accuses KKK members of being Jewish actors from Seinfeld.
[01:45:27.893 --> 01:45:31.615]  They have to do quotes on each word to put them together.
[01:45:31.615 --> 01:45:35.197]  If you're seeing a real quote, folks, it's like quotes and then seven, eight, nine words and then a quote.
[01:45:35.197 --> 01:45:39.440]  It's not one word quotes, one word quote, one word quote, or two words quote.
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:45.686]  I mean, this is incredible, because they don't want to put the part in there where I give the examples of where it's in the news.
[01:45:45.686 --> 01:45:48.569]  But don't worry, we'll do special reports on that now.
[01:45:48.569 --> 01:45:54.896]  Can you guys pull up a Jewish, leftist Jewish man arrested in attacks on Jewish cemeteries?
[01:45:54.896 --> 01:45:56.137]  Just as Trump said.
[01:45:56.137 --> 01:45:57.339]  Just as Trump said.
[01:45:57.339 --> 01:45:58.380]  You want to comment on that, Cernovich?
[01:45:59.522 --> 01:46:03.263]  Well, hate crime hoaxes are actually very common.
[01:46:03.263 --> 01:46:16.325]  And of course, the Southern Poverty Law Center does have white, non-Jewish people who stage these events too, which of course, we've all called out false flags on people of all races, religions, genders, and everything like that.
[01:46:16.325 --> 01:46:26.167]  And so what they want to do though is, and this is what I've learned is, what they want to do is they try to make it sound like you're criticizing all Jewish people, which you're clearly not.
[01:46:26.167 --> 01:46:28.588]  You're only criticizing agent provocateurs.
[01:46:29.188 --> 01:46:33.031]  Which, we criticize white people all the time too, that doesn't mean you hate white people.
[01:46:33.031 --> 01:46:36.834]  George Soros is trying to overthrow Israel, we're not.
[01:46:36.834 --> 01:46:39.596]  What do you think of that?
[01:46:39.596 --> 01:46:43.919]  Soros was named by Israel as an enemy of the state.
[01:46:43.919 --> 01:46:45.641]  Why does nobody ever want to talk about that?
[01:46:48.155 --> 01:46:54.641]  Why are the very strong, powerful, right-wing Jewish voices in America silenced by the fake news media?
[01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:59.206]  They're very, very powerful, right-wing Jewish voices and the media pretends like they don't even exist.
[01:46:59.206 --> 01:47:01.028]  I think that's anti-Semitic.
[01:47:01.028 --> 01:47:10.557]  I think that they should hear from very strong-minded, right-wing Jews who are opposed to Soros and other things and call this out, and bring down people who are being silenced.
[01:47:10.697 --> 01:47:13.038]  Yeah, you know, they're quiet for a lot of reasons.
[01:47:13.038 --> 01:47:17.038]  I think it's interesting that George Soros has a warrant out for his arrest in Russia.
[01:47:17.038 --> 01:47:17.739]  Other areas.
[01:47:17.739 --> 01:47:27.061]  I mean, I would encourage Trump to have his Justice Department charge Soros with sedition.
[01:47:27.061 --> 01:47:29.021]  He's clearly guilty of it.
[01:47:29.021 --> 01:47:35.883]  You can follow the money in his attempt to disrupt the peace and to violate the laws of this country.
[01:47:35.883 --> 01:47:37.763]  I mean, it is clear as can be.
[01:47:38.383 --> 01:47:46.775]  And what a message would that send to the enemies of this Constitution and our sovereignty, if he had Soros arrested.
[01:47:46.775 --> 01:47:50.920]  Of course, that leads us to the Clinton crime family and a few other things.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.601]  Exactly, this country is in a fight for its life.
[01:47:55.601 --> 01:48:00.102]  Cernovich, and you're going to be with us the whole next hour because I want to get into your dark sky scenarios.
[01:48:00.102 --> 01:48:07.403]  I want to get into the background of folks that actually pray and meet with Trump and talk to him on the phone almost daily and really how Christian he really is.
[01:48:07.403 --> 01:48:08.444]  This is powerful stuff coming up.
[01:48:08.444 --> 01:48:18.286]  But just briefly, in the two minutes we've got left, Mike Cernovich, the big fight going on inside the White House, blaming Bannon for this, the power struggle.
[01:48:18.286 --> 01:48:18.866]  What's your intel?
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:22.161]  Yeah, they're trying to frame me.
[01:48:22.161 --> 01:48:26.164]  So actually, Chuck Todd on Meet the Press read one of my tweets to H.R.
[01:48:26.164 --> 01:48:27.364]  McMaster.
[01:48:27.364 --> 01:48:31.347]  But you probably never heard about that, because who watches Meet the Press anymore?
[01:48:31.347 --> 01:48:42.434]  But Chuck Todd read my tweet to McMaster, and then Chuck Todd goes, he called me a self-described leader of the alt-right, when in fact, I've never called myself a leader of the alt-right.
[01:48:42.434 --> 01:48:44.375]  From day one, you don't even say the term alt-right.
[01:48:44.375 --> 01:48:46.356]  You're saying because they're going to connect you to racists.
[01:48:46.356 --> 01:48:49.478]  You've been saying since the term came out nine months ago that you're not part of it.
[01:48:50.592 --> 01:48:56.155]  Exactly, so what they're trying to do is they realize that McMaster does have a lot of problems.
[01:48:56.155 --> 01:49:02.899]  Sheldon Adelson's group, Zionist Organization of America, has consistently come out against H.R.
[01:49:02.899 --> 01:49:06.621]  McMaster, so they're freaking out within the White House, and they go, what are we going to do?
[01:49:06.621 --> 01:49:12.265]  Well, let's frame Cernovich for being part of these alt-rodents, as I call them, and then we'll try to
[01:49:12.865 --> 01:49:13.366]  We're good to go.
[01:49:28.739 --> 01:49:29.580]  Are defending him.
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:30.901]  CARES defended him.
[01:49:30.901 --> 01:49:32.922]  The Muslim Brotherhood has defended him.
[01:49:32.922 --> 01:49:35.243]  Everybody at the ADL has defended him.
[01:49:35.243 --> 01:49:36.604]  The SPLC has defended him.
[01:49:36.604 --> 01:49:38.045]  CNN has defended him.
[01:49:38.045 --> 01:49:40.947]  Everybody who wants Trump to fail is defending Trump.
[01:49:40.947 --> 01:49:46.950]  So now they're trying to smear me and frame me for... Yeah, the whole power structure, you mean, is defending McMaster.
[01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:48.571]  Clearly showing he is the bad guy.
[01:49:48.571 --> 01:49:52.854]  And you're the first guy I heard that really, along with my listeners, singled him out and said, this is the bad guy.
[01:49:54.301 --> 01:49:55.125]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:55.125 --> 01:49:57.755]  That was the big under-reported story.
[01:49:57.755 --> 01:49:58.900]  He flew under the radar.
[01:49:59.965 --> 01:50:04.566]  So with the media now, they're trying to frame Bannon for whatever I do.
[01:50:04.566 --> 01:50:05.647]  I don't do anything for Bannon.
[01:50:05.647 --> 01:50:13.089]  He's never given me any kind of instruction, and moreover, if he did, they're these people, they're lunatics, Alex, they're conspiracy theorists.
[01:50:13.089 --> 01:50:16.369]  I've even said, you and I, we don't even talk, and we should talk.
[01:50:16.369 --> 01:50:17.750]  Paul and I don't talk.
[01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:25.852]  None of us talk on the right because we're all so independent and free-minded that we don't coordinate on anything, and we should coordinate more, and that's probably why the left
[01:50:26.232 --> 01:50:28.213]  It's so much stronger than we are in many ways.
[01:50:28.213 --> 01:50:30.715]  It's because they are organized and we're all kind of on our own.
[01:50:30.715 --> 01:50:31.115]  Exactly.
[01:50:31.115 --> 01:50:34.577]  Do you think they're going to be able to get Bannon out?
[01:50:34.577 --> 01:50:36.998]  Every day in that White House, anything can happen.
[01:50:36.998 --> 01:50:40.100]  So on any given day, who knows what could happen?
[01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:43.002]  Every day that Bannon's in there is a good day for America.
[01:50:43.002 --> 01:50:46.083]  But it's hard to predict things out from even five minutes.
[01:50:46.083 --> 01:50:47.604]  All right, Mike Stern, that's amazing.
[01:50:47.604 --> 01:50:48.304]  Talk to you soon.
[01:50:48.304 --> 01:50:49.345]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:49.345 --> 01:50:51.166]  He'll be hosting, obviously, some this week.
[01:50:51.166 --> 01:50:52.527]  We'll be right back with Gary Haven.

[01:54:15.457 --> 01:54:16.918]  Gary Hayman's a smart guy.
[01:54:16.918 --> 01:54:21.522]  He says they're setting Trump up with a trap with his North Korea thing.
[01:54:21.522 --> 01:54:24.144]  That's coming up the next hour.
[01:54:24.144 --> 01:54:27.587]  We're gonna get, hopefully right now, into some of the background.
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:30.361]  We're good to go.
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:55:01.046]  BuzzFeed tested our supplements and found they were totally clean, but tried to lie and say, but we overcharge, not knowing the very company that they had had tested other supplements and then was selling them, recommending it as the best vitamin B12 in the country, when that's who we private label from.
[01:55:01.046 --> 01:55:03.047]  So we're calling it the BuzzFeed Special.
[01:55:04.332 --> 01:55:06.553]  But now, the BuzzFeed piece is gone.
[01:55:06.553 --> 01:55:09.195]  They're writing derivative pieces that are even more deceptive.
[01:55:09.195 --> 01:55:10.616]  So they're trying to shut us down.
[01:55:10.616 --> 01:55:13.558]  So when you fund us, you're getting high-quality products in front of the tip of the spear.
[01:55:13.558 --> 01:55:22.003]  So I'm combining last month's specials with this month's 1776 specials and calling it the BuzzFeed Special.
[01:55:22.003 --> 01:55:23.444]  Brain Force, 55% off.
[01:55:23.444 --> 01:55:29.168]  Survival Shield X2, which you really need if there's a nuclear war, but it really blocks the bad halogens, so it's the regular use that's great.
[01:55:29.168 --> 01:55:33.131]  It's not just the radioactive item, it blocks the chlorine, bromide,
[01:55:33.911 --> 01:55:34.993]  We're good to go.
[01:55:48.874 --> 01:55:51.935]  In the gaseous form and then put it safely into palm oil.
[01:55:51.935 --> 01:55:53.476]  They know this is proprietary.
[01:55:53.476 --> 01:55:55.116]  It's so hilarious.
[01:55:55.116 --> 01:55:57.917]  Superbloom, toothpaste is off massively.
[01:55:57.917 --> 01:56:04.739]  Caveman, Alexa Pure, Alexa Breeze, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Knockout Sleep Aid, DNA Force.
[01:56:04.739 --> 01:56:06.160]  We're talking 55 to 66% off across the board.
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:06.720]  Infowarscore.com.
[01:56:10.936 --> 01:56:16.839]  Now this will go through the rest of the month, but obviously some of these are going to have to stop selling because they're going to sell out.
[01:56:16.839 --> 01:56:21.122]  X2 because a lot of folks are buying it because of the nuclear war threat.
[01:56:21.122 --> 01:56:23.803]  Iodine, good iodine is flying off the shelves all over the country.
[01:56:23.803 --> 01:56:28.326]  You can just search the engine, iodine flying off the shelves, CBS News, you name it.
[01:56:28.326 --> 01:56:32.288]  We've also again got the iodine in the toothpaste and in the mouthwash.
[01:56:32.288 --> 01:56:33.089]  Really good for your gums.
[01:56:33.789 --> 01:56:38.934]  We have the new mouthwash with the iodine in it, and the colloidal silver as well, the super blue mouthwash is in.
[01:56:38.934 --> 01:56:42.337]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:42.337 --> 01:56:46.260]  And this is the biggest sale we've ever had.
[01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:48.242]  I keep saying, this is a big one, this is a big one.
[01:56:48.242 --> 01:56:54.528]  This is the biggest, because I combine two, and I love to make fun of BuzzFeed, and folks are really responding, so thank you for the support.
[01:56:54.528 --> 01:56:56.550]  We're trying to expand in the face of the globalists.
[01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:58.912]  You notice we get reporters in almost every big event now.
[01:56:59.212 --> 01:57:01.733]  We're hiring more reporters, more crew, and they're great people.
[01:57:01.733 --> 01:57:02.893]  So thank you all for the support.
[01:57:02.893 --> 01:57:08.395]  Gary, this is a short segment, but in the next, and in a little bit in the next, we're going to get into Trump and his spirituality.
[01:57:08.395 --> 01:57:14.797]  But just finishing up, with economic warfare, the way they're coming after us, we keep winning, but it is a little disconcerting.
[01:57:14.797 --> 01:57:16.318]  They don't stop, and they're turning it up.
[01:57:17.116 --> 01:57:19.958]  Yeah, I'll tell you, I think time's getting short right now.
[01:57:19.958 --> 01:57:23.461]  And the whole North Korea thing is really staged.
[01:57:23.461 --> 01:57:27.684]  You know, FDR said that nothing happens by accident.
[01:57:27.684 --> 01:57:31.568]  And so right now, they've kind of sucked Trump into this trap where there is no good outcome.
[01:57:32.248 --> 01:57:39.615]  And after the break, we'll talk about the ultimate lid on this trap that we need to warn President Trump about.
[01:57:39.615 --> 01:57:52.628]  And the interesting thing is the deep state, who normally is orchestrating these things, is going to be a victim of what's going to be happening, which I think is particularly interesting.
[01:57:52.628 --> 01:57:53.588]  So how much time do we have left?
[01:57:54.369 --> 01:57:59.895]  I'm writing a note here to name this segment, an emergency warning to President Trump on North Korea.
[01:57:59.895 --> 01:58:04.120]  Or should we name this segment, North Korea is a globalist trap for Trump, deep state trap?
[01:58:05.445 --> 01:58:12.907]  Yeah, except it's not the Deep State that are creating this trap, which would normally be the case.
[01:58:12.907 --> 01:58:18.068]  This is a trap that is going to trap the Deep State into something that they really don't want.
[01:58:18.068 --> 01:58:26.750]  So they think it's a trap, and that's why I noticed the head kingpin, Lord Rothschild, has actually come out and said, this isn't Trump's fault, North Korea's out of control, we need to back off.
[01:58:29.211 --> 01:58:33.358]  I'll find out what the really smart guy Gary Haven has to say in 70 seconds.

[02:00:03.106 --> 02:00:04.248]  Big Brother.
[02:00:04.248 --> 02:00:06.031]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:06.031 --> 02:00:07.953]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:07.953 --> 02:00:09.616]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:09.616 --> 02:00:11.279]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:11.279 --> 02:00:15.866]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.005 --> 02:00:30.551]  Okay, crack this nut for us on North Korea, then we'll come back and get into behind-the-scenes Trump's Christianity.
[02:00:30.551 --> 02:00:32.292]  Okay.
[02:00:32.292 --> 02:00:39.298]  North Korea obviously has been the big story on the news for the last couple of weeks, and for good reason.
[02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:41.000]  First of all, let me give you a little background on this thing.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.464]  I made a movie called Amerigeddon a couple years ago, and I wrote the script along with Mike Norris, Chuck Norris' son.
[02:00:47.365 --> 02:00:52.550]  And in the movie we depicted what I call the greatest threat to the United States.
[02:00:52.550 --> 02:01:05.280]  And that was the fact that North Korea has two satellites that circle our country twice a day right across the center of the country at the optimum altitude for something called a super EMP or an electromagnetic pulse.
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:11.125]  And what that means is that North Korea has the ability to detonate this device
[02:01:12.046 --> 02:01:22.977]  And according to two congressional studies, that if they detonated this EMP device, that electronics all across the country would be fried.
[02:01:22.977 --> 02:01:23.778]  Now what does that mean?
[02:01:23.778 --> 02:01:30.345]  It means there's no electricity, there's no internet, there's no water, there's no grocery distribution, there's no gas distribution.
[02:01:31.105 --> 02:01:37.831]  And two congressional studies concluded that 90% of Americans would die within 12 months.
[02:01:37.831 --> 02:01:41.875]  Now, I thought this was a pretty important thing for the American people to know.
[02:01:41.875 --> 02:01:45.478]  And I realized that the mainstream media was not talking about this.
[02:01:45.478 --> 02:01:48.300]  They were literally withholding this information.
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:56.668]  And our Congress, which had the power to pass laws to harden the grid and protect us from this very real threat, had done nothing.
[02:01:57.428 --> 02:02:03.314]  In fact, they were bought and paid for and silent on this issue, and I wanted to do something about it.
[02:02:03.314 --> 02:02:06.537]  So I became an expert on EMP.
[02:02:06.537 --> 02:02:17.047]  So suddenly, here we are dealing with North Korea and the threat of ICBMs, and nobody is talking about the real threat, which is an EMP.
[02:02:17.748 --> 02:02:31.962]  You know, on Thursday last week, I went to the New York Times and I read every story on North Korea that had been written over the previous week to see if anybody in the mainstream media was talking about or warning the American people about EMP.
[02:02:31.962 --> 02:02:38.088]  And it was so silent on the subject, I realized that that, of course, is by design.
[02:02:38.088 --> 02:02:40.851]  So, what is it that's going on with Trump right now?
[02:02:41.633 --> 02:02:56.643]  Well, you know, he has been kind of prodded and sucked into this trap where, because of his blustering, he's going to have to do something if Kim Jong-un does something provocative.
[02:02:56.643 --> 02:03:05.329]  For example, Kim Jong-un threatened to detonate these nuclear devices somewhere near Guam, not over Guam, but somewhere near
[02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:09.913]  Trump's going to have to back that up with something.
[02:03:09.913 --> 02:03:12.395]  His options, none of them are good.
[02:03:12.395 --> 02:03:19.280]  They include maybe a strategic nuke, maybe hitting some of these weapons that are on the border of Seoul.
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:20.962]  By the way, I've been to Seoul.
[02:03:20.962 --> 02:03:26.486]  I've got 400 curves in Korea, so I've been there multiple times.
[02:03:26.486 --> 02:03:29.729]  They're very vulnerable to this maniac across the deal.
[02:03:30.836 --> 02:03:33.339]  So, what's Trump going to do?
[02:03:33.339 --> 02:03:38.444]  And who benefits from the verge of World War III?
[02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:43.129]  Well, first of all, the deep state, which now has encircled Trump with his three generals.
[02:03:43.129 --> 02:03:46.252]  They control all access to Trump.
[02:03:46.252 --> 02:03:48.394]  They are part of a group that profit from war.
[02:03:49.295 --> 02:03:50.896]  And, you know, they want us in Syria.
[02:03:50.896 --> 02:03:55.318]  They want us spending tax dollars to fund their war machine.
[02:03:55.318 --> 02:04:00.780]  And the military-industrial complex, we all have realized, really owns Congress at this point in time.
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:09.364]  And, of course, the corporatists, and I'm talking about pharmaceutical companies and Big Ag and Big Oil, and, of course, let's not forget big banks.
[02:04:09.364 --> 02:04:14.207]  They all have this globalism move that will enrich them.
[02:04:15.345 --> 02:04:23.753]  But let's not forget there's actually another paradigm above even the globalists and they're the Illuminists.
[02:04:23.753 --> 02:04:25.855]  You know the Illuminists have a different agenda.
[02:04:25.855 --> 02:04:28.658]  They want America to diminish.
[02:04:28.658 --> 02:04:34.303]  They want America to get out of the way because we're the only thing standing.
[02:04:34.303 --> 02:04:35.264]  And that's why they want to get
[02:04:35.444 --> 02:04:35.704]  Thank you.
[02:04:52.003 --> 02:04:53.404]  Why is the fungus?
[02:04:53.404 --> 02:04:54.485]  Why is the mold?
[02:04:54.485 --> 02:04:56.226]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:04:56.226 --> 02:04:57.187]  What is going on?
[02:04:57.187 --> 02:04:57.947]  What has changed?
[02:05:22.263 --> 02:05:23.683]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[02:05:23.683 --> 02:05:25.664]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:05:25.664 --> 02:05:27.104]  For me, it's been incredible.

[02:05:31.645 --> 02:05:32.365]  Get it today.
[02:05:32.365 --> 02:05:32.945]  Limited run.

[02:05:39.006 --> 02:05:42.367]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:05:42.367 --> 02:05:44.687]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:05:44.687 --> 02:05:46.107]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:05:46.107 --> 02:05:48.028]  We're changing the world together.
[02:05:48.028 --> 02:05:49.048]  You are the Infowar.
[02:05:49.048 --> 02:05:49.748]  God bless you all.
[02:05:51.693 --> 02:05:56.360]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:05:56.360 --> 02:06:07.576]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better
[02:06:07.796 --> 02:06:08.336]  Let's do it!
[02:06:29.625 --> 02:06:31.986]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.

[02:08:11.922 --> 02:08:18.425]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.425 --> 02:08:20.827]  In a few minutes, we're going to Diamond and Silk.
[02:08:20.827 --> 02:08:22.607]  They don't need any introduction.
[02:08:22.607 --> 02:08:23.388]  Everybody loves them.
[02:08:24.875 --> 02:08:27.657]  And these ladies have been big supporters of Trump all along.
[02:08:27.657 --> 02:08:36.465]  Now they're trying to compare Trump to these idiots, these morons, these scumbag white supremacist people, and the other communist cop-killer groups that are there.
[02:08:36.465 --> 02:08:38.666]  And Trump said, yeah, both sides are bad, we shall love each other.
[02:08:38.666 --> 02:08:41.369]  And they spun that so he came back out.
[02:08:42.862 --> 02:08:45.444]  Yeah, specifically the white supremacists.
[02:08:45.444 --> 02:08:46.545]  They said that's not good enough.
[02:08:46.545 --> 02:08:47.865]  It's just like the David Duke thing.
[02:08:47.865 --> 02:08:49.747]  You do it a hundred times, it's not going to be enough.
[02:08:49.747 --> 02:08:55.310]  But the reason I originally been trying to get them on the last week, that's perfect to have them on now to talk about this interview, is Google.
[02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:57.492]  YouTube is censoring them, admittedly.
[02:08:57.492 --> 02:08:58.813]  Cutting off the revenue 90%.
[02:08:58.813 --> 02:09:00.034]  They've done it to us and what do they say?
[02:09:00.936 --> 02:09:04.099]  They say, they say extremist or bigoted or hateful.
[02:09:04.099 --> 02:09:07.402]  Well, we're trying to bring everybody together, but that's what they're doing.
[02:09:07.402 --> 02:09:11.046]  They're saying anybody that supports Trump is a racist.
[02:09:11.046 --> 02:09:15.190]  So Diamond and Silk ripped YouTube, saying 95% demoted.
[02:09:15.190 --> 02:09:18.954]  And again, they're not just doing YouTube to make money, but the point is that's discriminatory.
[02:09:19.474 --> 02:09:21.975]  If they don't let gay people get a cake bake, there's a lawsuit.
[02:09:21.975 --> 02:09:22.916]  Okay, whatever.
[02:09:22.916 --> 02:09:27.078]  But what about YouTube saying, if you are a conservative or libertarian, you're bad.
[02:09:27.078 --> 02:09:28.719]  We're going to talk to them here in just one moment.
[02:09:28.719 --> 02:09:30.299]  And Gary Haven's riding shotgun.
[02:09:30.299 --> 02:09:33.041]  Billionaire, founder of Curbs, patriot, filmmaker.
[02:09:33.041 --> 02:09:35.862]  Finish up your North Korea, because I'm going to ask them about that too.
[02:09:35.862 --> 02:09:39.584]  About the trap the globalists, the deep state, the illuminates are trying to set for him.
[02:09:40.618 --> 02:09:45.841]  So the endgame of this is Trump's going to be faced with several bad choices.
[02:09:45.841 --> 02:09:56.648]  And when he responds, as he's going to have to do because of all the blustering he's done, the secret weapon that North Korea has is this EMP that I was talking about, this electromagnetic pulse.
[02:09:59.230 --> 02:10:07.036]  If and when they detonate that thing, and 90% of Americans are at risk for dying, Trump is going to get the blame.
[02:10:07.036 --> 02:10:08.617]  And that's what they have in mind.
[02:10:08.617 --> 02:10:18.246]  And you've got to remember the... But it's funny you say that because they had an emergency Black Sky event they've never done last week preparing for this that got almost no coverage.
[02:10:18.246 --> 02:10:23.770]  Yeah, and you know, they always tend to have a false flag, or excuse me, a drill whenever weird things happen.
[02:10:23.770 --> 02:10:24.571]  An exercise drill.
[02:10:24.571 --> 02:10:26.773]  And isn't that interesting that they've got one for that as well.
[02:10:27.333 --> 02:10:50.564]  But at the endgame, this is what's so fascinating about this, the deep state that wants war and corporatism is going to lose on this one because the ultimate power, the Illuminists, are the ones that are going to bring America down, get us out of the way so that they can have their true global order, which is a communist world government ran by dictators or an oligarchy made up of them.
[02:10:50.564 --> 02:10:52.225]  So what is the solution?
[02:10:52.225 --> 02:10:53.826]  What can Trump do to avoid this?
[02:10:54.486 --> 02:10:57.988]  He could shoot down those satellites today.
[02:11:10.174 --> 02:11:15.117]  Or Hawaii, Kauai, or Alaska, Anchorage, Alaska, or Chicago, Illinois.
[02:11:15.117 --> 02:11:16.157]  They can hit all of them.
[02:11:16.157 --> 02:11:19.199]  If that guy says he's doing this, he's got weapons up in space.
[02:11:19.199 --> 02:11:21.640]  We've got missiles that can shoot down satellites.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:22.480]  Absolutely.
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:27.063]  And they've threatened that maybe they've got nukes on board to cause an EMP jacketed in the right.
[02:11:27.723 --> 02:11:30.504]  Uh, alloy to cause, you know, a larger EMP.
[02:11:30.504 --> 02:11:32.404]  We need to shoot those down immediately.
[02:11:32.404 --> 02:11:33.484]  And Trump needs to know that.
[02:11:33.484 --> 02:11:35.144]  He's been set up on this.
[02:11:35.144 --> 02:11:40.745]  And even his deep state people that are giving him advice think that this is going to lead to more war that they profit from.
[02:11:40.745 --> 02:11:42.306]  He's got to shoot them down.
[02:11:42.306 --> 02:11:44.426]  That's the Trump card they hold over him.
[02:11:44.426 --> 02:11:45.986]  And no one will even know what happened to him.
[02:11:45.986 --> 02:11:46.486]  That's the great way.
[02:11:46.486 --> 02:11:48.267]  I mean, we've got satellite killers in space.
[02:11:48.267 --> 02:11:48.907]  No one will even know.
[02:11:48.907 --> 02:11:50.007]  We can kill them from space.
[02:11:50.007 --> 02:11:50.627]  Yeah.
[02:11:50.627 --> 02:11:51.607]  Easy as can be.
[02:11:51.607 --> 02:11:55.568]  Now, I'm watching the faces of our, uh, these lovely ladies that are about to be on here.
[02:11:56.208 --> 02:11:57.970]  And I think we're terrifying them.
[02:11:57.970 --> 02:11:59.451]  Would that be accurate?
[02:11:59.451 --> 02:12:00.973]  No, they're pretty upbeat and pretty on target.
[02:12:00.973 --> 02:12:03.495]  But yeah, hey, they stand up against the liberals, so they'll do it.
[02:12:03.495 --> 02:12:06.598]  But seriously, Diamond and Silk, diamondandsilk.com.
[02:12:06.598 --> 02:12:16.627]  Don't need to tell folks who you ladies are, but, you know, we see the economy, $4 trillion in the stock market, $400 billion in new jobs, 69% down with felons not coming across the border.
[02:12:16.627 --> 02:12:18.529]  The veterans getting better care, get 25% more visits in.
[02:12:22.156 --> 02:12:28.384]  All the new factories getting built, all the great things happening out of the carbon tax, out of the TPP.
[02:12:28.384 --> 02:12:31.247]  Trump's done so much, but the media says he's done nothing.
[02:12:31.247 --> 02:12:34.551]  In fact, he's a KKK member, and in fact, I am, and you are.
[02:12:34.551 --> 02:12:37.615]  We're all bigots, and we're not allowed to even have our YouTube channels.
[02:12:37.615 --> 02:12:41.400]  Paul Watson's having his banned, but you ladies are talking about a class action suit, let me tell you.
[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:48.121]  I'm looking to join that then, because I've been saying, I'm not a litigious person, but when we're getting discriminated, that's real discrimination.
[02:12:48.121 --> 02:12:54.583]  When people act like they've got an open and free platform, and then they use you and use your videos and YouTube, the you in it.
[02:12:54.583 --> 02:13:05.865]  The lawyers have said, Congress has said, Congressman Warbocker's talked to the lawyers, this is a total civil rights violation, not giving us service, and letting Al Qaeda have websites on YouTube, but they can't.
[02:13:05.865 --> 02:13:08.426]  So, Diamond and Silk, you ladies are here, thank you for joining us.
[02:13:09.138 --> 02:13:11.079]  Thank you for having us.
[02:13:11.079 --> 02:13:11.780]  So, lay it out.
[02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:13.201]  What's happening?
[02:13:13.201 --> 02:13:21.626]  Well, you know, YouTube stopped the monetization of our videos the other day, about 95%, saying it's not suitable for all advertisers.
[02:13:21.626 --> 02:13:23.467]  Now, we're in good standard with YouTube.
[02:13:23.467 --> 02:13:25.308]  We've been in good standard for the past two years.
[02:13:25.308 --> 02:13:27.770]  The past two years, they had us monetized.
[02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:31.492]  Now, all of a sudden, they have stopped the monetization on those videos.
[02:13:31.892 --> 02:13:39.562]  The deal is, is that we talk about the President, we are loyal supporters of the President, we talk about his agenda.
[02:13:39.562 --> 02:13:49.334]  Now you're telling us that we're in good standings with you two, but what you speak is controversial, so no advertisers want to advertise around you.
[02:13:49.334 --> 02:13:50.255]  Well, how can
[02:13:50.815 --> 02:13:56.300]  Why is YouTube deciding what the advertisers should be advertising around?
[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:59.864]  Why not let the advertisers pick and choose based on demographics?
[02:13:59.864 --> 02:14:00.484]  Exactly.
[02:14:00.484 --> 02:14:03.807]  So this is clearly discrimination, prejudice, and bias.
[02:14:03.807 --> 02:14:04.348]  That's right.
[02:14:04.348 --> 02:14:05.629]  And it won't be tolerated.
[02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:07.370]  And it's a breach of their contract.
[02:14:07.370 --> 02:14:11.234]  That's right, because we signed a term and agreement where you said you're going to
[02:14:11.454 --> 02:14:12.174]  That's right.
[02:14:12.174 --> 02:14:12.614]  That's right.
[02:14:12.614 --> 02:14:13.034]  That's right.
[02:14:34.588 --> 02:14:37.629]  Yeah, you know, I asked who was afraid a minute ago.
[02:14:37.629 --> 02:14:39.229]  I'm afraid now.
[02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:42.350]  I would not want to be targeted by you guys.
[02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:48.732]  They're totally right, though, because they always advertised they were a utility open for everybody to get everybody there.
[02:14:48.732 --> 02:14:53.313]  Now they're selectively banning basically anybody who's a libertarian, anybody who's conservative.
[02:14:53.313 --> 02:14:56.554]  They're banning people with cat channels that are popular.
[02:14:56.554 --> 02:14:57.894]  They don't want anybody in there.
[02:14:58.194 --> 02:14:58.955]  That's crazy.
[02:14:58.955 --> 02:15:05.181]  Now you guys are, the only thing you've done that's offended them is be a Trump supporter, is that right?
[02:15:06.024 --> 02:15:11.946]  Well, as far as I can see, because that's all we talk about is President Trump, his agenda, what he's doing.
[02:15:11.946 --> 02:15:16.448]  But we try to do it in a comical way so people can laugh while we're explaining.
[02:15:16.448 --> 02:15:17.829]  I'm going to be clear.
[02:15:17.829 --> 02:15:24.611]  They're being banned and being cheated because they're so popular with millions and millions of views on each of their videos, hundreds of thousands on the little ones.
[02:15:24.611 --> 02:15:28.133]  It's because they're so upbeat and positive that they are being banned.
[02:15:29.033 --> 02:15:29.353]  Right.
[02:15:29.353 --> 02:15:31.835]  And keep in mind that they also have a block button.
[02:15:31.835 --> 02:15:35.158]  If you don't want to hear what Diamond and Silk have to say, don't come to our channel.
[02:15:35.158 --> 02:15:35.398]  Right.
[02:15:35.398 --> 02:15:39.862]  If you come to our channel and you listen and you say, I don't like what they're saying, then go to another channel.
[02:15:39.862 --> 02:15:41.443]  You don't have to be on our channel.
[02:15:41.443 --> 02:15:51.172]  Because our subscribers, for YouTube to take and manipulate the system and not allow our subscribers to know when we have dropped the video, that is wrong.
[02:15:51.172 --> 02:15:52.933]  They have breached their contract.
[02:15:52.933 --> 02:15:54.795]  And somebody's going to have to do something about that.
[02:15:54.795 --> 02:15:56.196]  And let's be clear, you upload a video,
[02:15:56.576 --> 02:15:58.198]  And then they change the contract later.
[02:15:58.198 --> 02:15:59.420]  I mean, it is getting bad.
[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:04.027]  Then they let the leftists get on there and talk about killing people, calling for violence.
[02:16:04.027 --> 02:16:04.908]  I mean, they're out of control.
[02:16:06.127 --> 02:16:08.569]  What's happened to you in the context?
[02:16:08.569 --> 02:16:13.873]  How do you tie it into Antifa, the cop-killer groups out stirring up racial divides everywhere?
[02:16:13.873 --> 02:16:15.495]  They're a bunch of racist idiots.
[02:16:15.495 --> 02:16:19.058]  And then a bunch of other racist idiots show up.
[02:16:19.058 --> 02:16:19.898]  Bad things happen.
[02:16:19.898 --> 02:16:20.619]  We all decry it.
[02:16:20.619 --> 02:16:22.941]  Trump decries it in a tweet, in a speech.
[02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:26.143]  And they say he didn't specifically name the groups.
[02:16:26.143 --> 02:16:28.445]  It took me a couple hours even figuring out who those groups were.
[02:16:29.647 --> 02:16:36.417]  It's like groups saying they're all right, but they're in some South thing I don't even know what these groups are and then now it's Trump's fault again.
[02:16:36.417 --> 02:16:37.178]  What do you say about that?
[02:16:37.898 --> 02:16:47.981]  Well, first of all, stop blaming our president for these crazy ignorant groups with these ignorant ideology or whatever they're spewing, the hate that they're spewing.
[02:16:47.981 --> 02:16:49.802]  You know who I blame for all of this?
[02:16:49.802 --> 02:16:50.442]  Who?
[02:16:50.442 --> 02:16:59.285]  I blame the mayor of Charlottesville who knew that a hate group was coming and did not prepare for it or did not protect his citizens.
[02:16:59.605 --> 02:17:02.967]  That has nothing to do with the President of the United States.
[02:17:02.967 --> 02:17:03.427]  That's right.
[02:17:03.427 --> 02:17:06.049]  The President of the United States addressed the issue.
[02:17:06.049 --> 02:17:10.391]  He came back out today and addressed it again and called them by their names.
[02:17:10.391 --> 02:17:11.012]  That's right.
[02:17:11.012 --> 02:17:23.019]  Any of those groups that was down there creating violence, the Justice Department is going to be dealing with you because at the end of the day we have a person that's dead and we have several people that's been injured all because of hate.
[02:17:23.584 --> 02:17:41.104]  And exactly, and the mayor now admits they ordered a stand-down, Mayor Michael Singer, and by all the laws I've read, the police said, we've been ordered to stand down, when they could have stopped it, and they made everybody march together to actually stir it up, which they caught Obama doing, remember, in the Justice Department in Maryland in places.
[02:17:41.104 --> 02:17:42.846]  Why do you think they want to do something like that?
[02:17:43.479 --> 02:17:45.460]  Well, you know they want to create havoc.
[02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:46.320]  And divide.
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:50.823]  They love it when people are bickering because all of that stuff play out on television.
[02:17:50.823 --> 02:17:51.223]  Exactly.
[02:17:51.223 --> 02:17:56.185]  And that's how the very fake news make their money because you know their ratings are dropping.
[02:17:56.185 --> 02:17:56.505]  That's right.
[02:17:56.505 --> 02:18:01.248]  And it's so sad that we are being put against each other.
[02:18:01.248 --> 02:18:02.188]  But you know what?
[02:18:02.188 --> 02:18:03.469]  People got to understand.
[02:18:03.929 --> 02:18:12.412]  Slavery, the KKK, and all of these other movements were driven and deemed, and they all come from the Democratic Party.
[02:18:12.412 --> 02:18:14.393]  They are the ones started all of this foolishness.
[02:18:14.393 --> 02:18:14.853]  That's right.
[02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:19.895]  But it's time to put a stop to it, because it will not be tolerated in our country.
[02:18:19.895 --> 02:18:25.377]  Because what it's sounding like and looking like is that it's the same script, but different masks.
[02:18:25.377 --> 02:18:25.937]  That's right.
[02:18:26.537 --> 02:18:33.900]  The KKK running around with a white sheep, but you also got another group that's got their hands tied up in black and black gear.
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:36.060]  So it's still, I mean, it's all hate.
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:39.982]  They go out and do racial attacks trying to get people to them who are white to do the racial attacks.
[02:18:39.982 --> 02:18:46.684]  I always love how it's mainly white people screaming all this anti-white stuff, trying to get a race war going, and then it's Soros funded.
[02:18:46.684 --> 02:18:47.605]  It's ridiculous.
[02:18:47.605 --> 02:18:48.445]  It's so obvious.
[02:18:49.172 --> 02:18:49.712]  No.
[02:18:49.712 --> 02:18:51.973]  It's very obvious and it's so sad.
[02:18:51.973 --> 02:18:54.974]  And it's sad that people let other people use them like that.
[02:18:54.974 --> 02:18:55.374]  That's right.
[02:18:55.374 --> 02:18:56.754]  But we have to get a handle on it.
[02:18:56.754 --> 02:19:00.956]  You know, we're two black women and we get hate all day.
[02:19:00.956 --> 02:19:07.298]  People throw race, they're always being very, very, very racist towards us.
[02:19:07.298 --> 02:19:11.759]  And if you don't believe us, all you have to do is go look at our wall of shame at diamondandsilk.com.
[02:19:11.759 --> 02:19:14.760]  And are you talking about mainly leftists saying racist things to you?
[02:19:16.523 --> 02:19:18.965]  Absolutely, they say racist things to us all the time.
[02:19:18.965 --> 02:19:22.008]  Go on our page, go on our website, okay?
[02:19:22.008 --> 02:19:24.690]  So, racism has to be stopped from all sides.
[02:19:24.690 --> 02:19:25.111]  Exactly.
[02:19:25.111 --> 02:19:26.772]  Let me say this then.
[02:19:26.772 --> 02:19:27.693]  Ladies, we've got to go to break.
[02:19:27.693 --> 02:19:29.415]  When I come back, I'm going to talk about our lawsuits.
[02:19:29.415 --> 02:19:30.415]  I'm serious.
[02:19:30.415 --> 02:19:33.258]  I want to sue Google and YouTube for the discrimination against us.
[02:19:33.258 --> 02:19:35.400]  They've cut us down by almost 90% as well.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:36.181]  I guess it's more with you.
[02:19:36.801 --> 02:19:39.546]  I don't want to sue, but I need to sue for everybody's First Amendment.
[02:19:39.546 --> 02:19:48.660]  So I'd like to talk about if you get the right lawyer or whatever, helping fund your lawsuit, or getting some pro bono lawyers, or joining with you in a lawsuit, because it needs to be done.
[02:19:48.660 --> 02:19:50.143]  I'd like to file suit this month.
[02:19:50.143 --> 02:19:50.664]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:51.087 --> 02:19:52.748]  Do you trust our economy?
[02:19:52.748 --> 02:19:54.450]  How about our banking system?
[02:19:54.450 --> 02:20:01.635]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now, and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.

[02:21:49.955 --> 02:21:54.419]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[02:21:54.419 --> 02:21:56.020]  Those times may be near.
[02:21:56.020 --> 02:21:56.921]  Think about it.
[02:21:56.921 --> 02:22:01.524]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:22:01.524 --> 02:22:06.168]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:22:06.528 --> 02:22:12.335]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:22:12.335 --> 02:22:19.043]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[02:22:19.043 --> 02:22:21.586]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[02:22:22.026 --> 02:22:24.828]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[02:22:51.302 --> 02:22:54.544]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[02:23:20.158 --> 02:23:22.539]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:23:22.539 --> 02:23:30.581]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[02:23:45.225 --> 02:23:45.685]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:23:53.553 --> 02:23:55.877]  We're good.
[02:24:15.475 --> 02:24:34.409]  By the way, behind the scenes, we have guests coming on the show, and when those people say they're even coming on the show, Antifa, the Democrats, everybody calls them, emails them and says, we're gonna ruin your life, we're gonna go after your family, we're gonna shut you down, we're gonna say horrible things about you, don't even go on my show.
[02:24:35.169 --> 02:24:36.169]  As if that hurts me.
[02:24:36.169 --> 02:24:38.090]  I could sit there all day by myself and talk.
[02:24:38.090 --> 02:24:39.951]  It's just interesting to talk to other people.
[02:24:39.951 --> 02:24:42.031]  It just shows how we're all being terrorized.
[02:24:42.031 --> 02:24:57.617]  And these ladies, with hundreds of millions of views, all over national television, they're loved by people, they're entrepreneurial, they're just, I'd call them not even right-wing or left-wing, just, let's have prosperity, let's be positive, and 95% of their revenue gone.
[02:24:57.617 --> 02:24:59.738]  First, they did 60% against us last year.
[02:25:00.638 --> 02:25:02.020]  Then it was 75.
[02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:03.501]  Now it's over 90.
[02:25:03.501 --> 02:25:09.868]  We're bringing in, you know, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars into this show to be able to fund ourselves off YouTube.
[02:25:09.868 --> 02:25:11.589]  That's basically all gone.
[02:25:11.589 --> 02:25:13.852]  I mean, it's less than 10%.
[02:25:13.852 --> 02:25:15.674]  But we've got other ways to fund ourselves.
[02:25:15.674 --> 02:25:18.617]  But next is total censorship, and that's already happening.
[02:25:18.617 --> 02:25:19.297]  So I do.
[02:25:20.653 --> 02:25:24.055]  I was talking to Gary Havener during the break, and he runs stuff in over 100 countries.
[02:25:24.055 --> 02:25:27.076]  We have to sue them because what they're doing is wrong.
[02:25:27.076 --> 02:25:28.376]  It's racketeering.
[02:25:28.376 --> 02:25:31.257]  We must stand, and we've got to start suing the Antifa.
[02:25:31.257 --> 02:25:35.339]  We've got to start suing these people who want to push things.
[02:25:35.339 --> 02:25:37.360]  Don't go out and fight with them in the streets.
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:40.121]  Don't go out and fight with the white supremacist idiots either.
[02:25:40.121 --> 02:25:42.822]  It's time to do things legally through the system.
[02:25:42.822 --> 02:25:44.703]  Diamond and Silk ladies, lay it out for folks.
[02:25:45.521 --> 02:25:46.501]  I agree with you.
[02:25:46.501 --> 02:25:49.442]  Let's go head on unless we may have to go ahead and sue.
[02:25:49.442 --> 02:25:49.902]  That's right.
[02:25:49.902 --> 02:25:56.223]  Because these are, you know, listen, we have been victimized, this is bias, and this is clearly discrimination.
[02:25:56.223 --> 02:25:56.683]  That's right.
[02:25:56.683 --> 02:26:05.265]  To tell me I can't talk about my president, and if I do, I'm going to withhold something from you, that's not fair to us because we built that platform.
[02:26:05.265 --> 02:26:05.665]  That's right.
[02:26:05.665 --> 02:26:09.306]  So I don't believe that you two thought this all the way out and thought this all the way through.
[02:26:09.306 --> 02:26:14.567]  And every business have a right to regulate, but they do not have a right to discriminate, intimidate,
[02:26:14.887 --> 02:26:16.708]  And manipulate in order to dominate.
[02:26:16.708 --> 02:26:17.128]  That's right.
[02:26:17.128 --> 02:26:18.689]  They don't have a right to do that.
[02:26:18.689 --> 02:26:20.229]  Right.
[02:26:20.229 --> 02:26:23.471]  Sorry, Gary lost his audio for a minute but I could hear you.
[02:26:23.471 --> 02:26:25.932]  They were saying they have a right to regulate things but not to discriminate.
[02:26:26.946 --> 02:26:31.928]  They don't have a right to discriminate, intimidate, or manipulate just to dominate.
[02:26:31.928 --> 02:26:33.649]  They don't have a right to do that.
[02:26:33.649 --> 02:26:34.989]  And guess what?
[02:26:34.989 --> 02:26:37.530]  YouTube is a social media platform.
[02:26:37.530 --> 02:26:42.292]  So a social media platform is people that get on a platform with creative ideas.
[02:26:42.292 --> 02:26:43.653]  It's like a telephone.
[02:26:43.653 --> 02:26:47.294]  Imagine if somebody was on the telephone with you telling you what to talk about.
[02:26:47.294 --> 02:26:49.375]  I mean, this is beyond North Korea.
[02:26:50.706 --> 02:26:55.288]  But one thing in YouTube policy, it doesn't tell you that you have to be liberal to sign up.
[02:26:55.288 --> 02:26:55.768]  That's right.
[02:26:55.768 --> 02:26:56.709]  It doesn't tell you.
[02:26:56.709 --> 02:27:00.050]  So the deal is, is you're trying to shut down my conservancy.
[02:27:00.050 --> 02:27:00.910]  They're lying.
[02:27:00.910 --> 02:27:01.311]  Exactly.
[02:27:01.311 --> 02:27:02.671]  They're lying in their rules.
[02:27:02.671 --> 02:27:06.873]  They're saying they're open and free, but if you're not a mainline establishment liberal, you're not welcome.
[02:27:07.867 --> 02:27:09.988]  That's exactly what we see.
[02:27:09.988 --> 02:27:10.988]  That's how we feel.
[02:27:10.988 --> 02:27:13.328]  That's how YouTube is making us feel.
[02:27:13.328 --> 02:27:18.750]  Because we're black, we're conservative, we're Republicans, and we are loyal supporters to the President.
[02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:20.090]  And now it's a problem.
[02:27:20.090 --> 02:27:26.192]  Well, I'm looking into the best discrimination antitrust lawyers, and I'm giving you my commitment.
[02:27:26.892 --> 02:27:28.854]  That we're going to find the lawyers.
[02:27:28.854 --> 02:27:30.355]  I'm going to sue them.
[02:27:30.355 --> 02:27:32.297]  I would like you to join me as plaintiffs.
[02:27:32.297 --> 02:27:34.719]  Paul Watson is going to be involved as well.
[02:27:34.719 --> 02:27:37.001]  Because we need to get this out in court.
[02:27:37.001 --> 02:27:37.841]  This is bullying.
[02:27:37.841 --> 02:27:40.684]  This is the shutdown of free speech.
[02:27:40.684 --> 02:27:41.704]  This is so un-American.
[02:27:41.704 --> 02:27:42.565]  This is so dangerous.
[02:27:44.907 --> 02:27:47.387]  Plenty of precedent for this.
[02:27:47.387 --> 02:27:54.169]  Power lines that run across the country, pipelines, you know, these infrastructures that serve the community and the good.
[02:27:54.169 --> 02:27:57.309]  Cable television is another previous example.
[02:27:57.309 --> 02:28:03.511]  They have got to have the ability to provide services to everyone, not to be monopolistic.
[02:28:03.511 --> 02:28:09.572]  So this is a violation of, certainly, of monopoly laws that exist in this country.
[02:28:09.572 --> 02:28:10.912]  And we have Google and YouTube.
[02:28:12.586 --> 02:28:16.254]  Openly, previously saying that and arguing that so they could have a monopoly.
[02:28:16.254 --> 02:28:16.875]  We have them!
[02:28:17.932 --> 02:28:19.293]  They're deliberately doing this.
[02:28:19.293 --> 02:28:21.155]  They are openly doing this here.
[02:28:21.155 --> 02:28:26.259]  And what we're telling our people is to go to our YouTube channel, The Viewer's View, and subscribe to us.
[02:28:26.259 --> 02:28:32.724]  And a special thank you to everybody that is contributing to us through PayPal at diamondandsilk at gmail.com.
[02:28:32.724 --> 02:28:36.887]  Thank you so much, because they're telling us if YouTube won't monetize you, we will.
[02:28:36.887 --> 02:28:42.692]  They love our strong voices, and they love the fact that we tell it like it is, and we're not afraid to tell it like it is.
[02:28:42.692 --> 02:28:44.993]  And YouTube, you gonna hear from Diamond and Silk.
[02:28:44.993 --> 02:28:45.354]  Oh, yes.
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:51.742]  Exactly, and then the Antifa will target your PayPal, but you just gotta fight through that and file suit there.
[02:28:51.742 --> 02:28:54.844]  I had PayPal about seven years ago, try that with us, and I got the lawyers involved.
[02:28:54.844 --> 02:28:56.424]  And it's because, hey, you know what?
[02:28:56.424 --> 02:29:00.546]  I'm allowed to eat in your restaurant, I'm following the laws, I'm allowed to use your bathroom.
[02:29:00.546 --> 02:29:03.047]  I mean, it really does come down to a civil rights movement, doesn't it?
[02:29:03.907 --> 02:29:05.288]  Absolutely, that's right.
[02:29:05.288 --> 02:29:09.169]  Because our civil rights have been encroached upon, even our political rights.
[02:29:09.169 --> 02:29:09.949]  You know?
[02:29:09.949 --> 02:29:11.409]  And you can't do that.
[02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:13.270]  It's discrimination and it's fine.
[02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:15.410]  And I think they're trying to cut off voices.
[02:29:15.410 --> 02:29:17.831]  That's right, because they can't debate us.
[02:29:17.831 --> 02:29:18.611]  They can't debate us.
[02:29:18.611 --> 02:29:21.392]  Diamond and Silt, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:29:21.392 --> 02:29:22.152]  You're amazing.
[02:29:22.152 --> 02:29:22.992]  And I love you.
[02:29:22.992 --> 02:29:24.833]  And I can feel the love.
[02:29:24.833 --> 02:29:25.813]  And we're coming together.
[02:29:25.813 --> 02:29:26.593]  God bless you.
[02:29:26.593 --> 02:29:27.474]  God bless you guys.
[02:29:27.474 --> 02:29:29.054]  I need to talk to you off the air soon.
[02:29:29.054 --> 02:29:30.074]  We're going to follow that suit.
[02:29:30.074 --> 02:29:31.175]  I've got to do it.
[02:29:31.175 --> 02:29:31.895]  You've got my word.
[02:29:32.655 --> 02:29:33.336]  We got this.
[02:29:33.336 --> 02:29:34.256]  You don't have to worry.
[02:29:34.256 --> 02:29:35.537]  Ain't no mountain high enough.
[02:29:35.537 --> 02:29:35.957]  We're coming.
[02:29:35.957 --> 02:29:37.638]  I want to get you in studio.
[02:29:37.638 --> 02:29:40.300]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:41.701]  We're on the march.
[02:29:41.701 --> 02:29:44.222]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:44.222 --> 02:29:46.904]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:52.077 --> 02:29:53.498]  Why is the fungus?
[02:29:53.498 --> 02:29:54.579]  Why is the mold?
[02:29:54.579 --> 02:29:56.300]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:29:56.300 --> 02:29:57.281]  What is going on?
[02:29:57.281 --> 02:29:58.041]  What has changed?
[02:30:22.337 --> 02:30:23.778]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[02:30:23.778 --> 02:30:25.740]  I want to get your reviews on here, what you have to say.
[02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:27.201]  For me, it's been incredible.
[02:30:27.201 --> 02:30:31.745]  MycoZX, antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.

[02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:42.453]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:30:42.453 --> 02:30:44.795]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:30:44.795 --> 02:30:46.196]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:30:46.196 --> 02:30:48.137]  We're changing the world together.
[02:30:48.137 --> 02:30:49.158]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:30:49.158 --> 02:30:49.899]  God bless you all.
[02:30:51.593 --> 02:31:00.337]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:31:00.337 --> 02:31:00.878]  That's right.

[02:31:20.407 --> 02:31:20.627]  Woo!
[02:31:20.627 --> 02:31:21.667]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:31:21.667 --> 02:31:30.410]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:31:30.410 --> 02:31:39.993]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:31:39.993 --> 02:31:43.434]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:31:43.434 --> 02:31:47.555]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[02:32:08.482 --> 02:32:11.924]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:32:11.924 --> 02:32:15.107]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:32:15.107 --> 02:32:18.989]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:18.989 --> 02:32:26.154]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:26.154 --> 02:32:31.538]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[02:32:31.818 --> 02:32:33.859]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[02:32:33.859 --> 02:32:42.145]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spirament was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new bubblegum-flavored Super Blue that is Spirament-free.
[02:32:42.145 --> 02:32:50.471]  Learn more about the new bubblegum-flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:32:59.741 --> 02:33:02.422]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:02.422 --> 02:33:19.066]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:33:19.066 --> 02:33:27.469]  Well, Jason Kessler was the leader of the white nationalist rally that he called Uniting the Right.
[02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:28.349]  I'll tell you point blank,
[02:33:29.730 --> 02:33:31.151]  I don't agree with what he did.
[02:33:31.151 --> 02:33:34.192]  I think he walked right into a trap.
[02:33:34.192 --> 02:33:37.573]  But the media will then act like this guy is Satan incarnate.
[02:33:37.573 --> 02:33:42.836]  But then you've got black nationalists and Hispanic nationalist groups that are saying, kill all the white people.
[02:33:42.836 --> 02:33:44.316]  And they're teaching that at universities.
[02:33:44.316 --> 02:33:46.577]  And George Soros and others are pushing that.
[02:33:46.577 --> 02:33:49.279]  And they're saying, have no whites on the campus day.
[02:33:49.279 --> 02:33:52.040]  That's going to create this white backlash.
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:54.481]  I'm worried about cancer rates going up in everybody.
[02:33:54.481 --> 02:33:56.662]  I'm worried about the big studies out that the flicker rate
[02:33:57.282 --> 02:33:59.203]  on these modern light bulbs are frying our brains.
[02:33:59.203 --> 02:34:03.184]  That was in mainstream news yesterday I told folks about with engineers 20 years ago.
[02:34:03.184 --> 02:34:06.346]  I'm worried about humanity making it together.
[02:34:06.346 --> 02:34:18.090]  But I also understand the left has created racial identity politics that they're using, cheating against the open free society and the system that the United States basically established and set up.
[02:34:18.090 --> 02:34:21.552]  And I also get to sit there and experience, as the social contract is broken,
[02:34:23.024 --> 02:34:30.911]  Classical racism, the opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about, where the media says it's about what color you are, not about the character of your deeds.
[02:34:30.911 --> 02:34:39.298]  So, there's that argument, yes, and there's the argument from the minorities that they've had racists do stuff to them, so they should be racist.
[02:34:39.298 --> 02:34:42.861]  The point is, it's being manipulated.
[02:34:42.861 --> 02:34:44.822]  Why aren't we talking about the police that stood down?
[02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:47.401]  And the mayor that ordered it.
[02:34:47.401 --> 02:34:52.224]  Why aren't we talking about Soros funding all these anti-white, anti-American groups?
[02:34:52.224 --> 02:35:02.249]  So, I've got the media out there saying that, you know, Mike Cernovich is Jason Kessler, even though they fight with each other all day, and that he's the leader of the alt-right, or that Paul Watson is.
[02:35:02.249 --> 02:35:06.932]  Paul Watson rightly said, we're the new right, or the new libertarian movement.
[02:35:07.672 --> 02:35:11.874]  A lot of people are classical liberals that don't like the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton.
[02:35:11.874 --> 02:35:15.175]  I tweeted an image this morning of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary.
[02:35:15.175 --> 02:35:18.996]  A real photo of just where they look like conniving evil witches.
[02:35:18.996 --> 02:35:22.297]  Then you read the WikiLeaks, it's the worst stuff you could ever imagine.
[02:35:22.297 --> 02:35:24.258]  How to create racial divide.
[02:35:24.258 --> 02:35:26.939]  How to keep people desperate.
[02:35:26.939 --> 02:35:29.400]  So yes, Mr. Kessler has his right to march.
[02:35:30.478 --> 02:35:32.299]  And the police stood down.
[02:35:32.299 --> 02:35:34.480]  And so who's the bigger sinner here?
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:37.842]  The guy that thinks folks are out to get white people so he's joining with white people.
[02:35:37.842 --> 02:35:38.722]  I think it's misguided.
[02:35:38.722 --> 02:35:39.943]  I think it's, you know, wrong.
[02:35:39.943 --> 02:35:42.204]  I think it's playing into the larger global trap.
[02:35:42.204 --> 02:35:43.664]  But it's tribalism.
[02:35:43.664 --> 02:35:44.825]  It's an old human instinct.
[02:35:44.825 --> 02:35:47.546]  It's what the racist blacks and Hispanics and others.
[02:35:47.546 --> 02:35:50.147]  You go to any prison, it's segregated along race.
[02:35:50.147 --> 02:35:51.008]  This is a reality.
[02:35:52.261 --> 02:35:54.763]  But what about the police that were ordered to stand down?
[02:35:54.763 --> 02:35:55.863]  Are they being looked at?
[02:35:55.863 --> 02:35:57.324]  What about the mayor?
[02:35:57.324 --> 02:36:00.406]  And then he tried to march or go speak at the courthouse yesterday.
[02:36:00.406 --> 02:36:02.107]  We're going to play that footage.
[02:36:02.107 --> 02:36:05.489]  And the police let him get beat up and attacked yet again.
[02:36:05.489 --> 02:36:09.392]  And the media acted like they'd started it.
[02:36:09.392 --> 02:36:10.693]  They'd done it yet again.
[02:36:10.693 --> 02:36:12.134]  So in these Democrat cities,
[02:36:13.168 --> 02:36:16.170]  They're not letting people have their free speech.
[02:36:16.170 --> 02:36:19.172]  Let's start it over with some audio.
[02:36:19.172 --> 02:36:22.474]  Here is Jason Kessler trying to speak.
[02:36:22.474 --> 02:36:22.834]  Here it is.
[02:36:33.106 --> 02:36:34.647]  Get the f*** outta here man!
[02:36:34.647 --> 02:36:35.808]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:35.808 --> 02:36:37.509]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:37.509 --> 02:36:38.910]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:40.631]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:40.631 --> 02:36:41.292]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:41.292 --> 02:36:41.952]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:41.952 --> 02:36:42.693]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:42.693 --> 02:36:43.153]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:43.153 --> 02:36:43.794]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:43.794 --> 02:36:44.914]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:44.914 --> 02:36:45.955]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:45.955 --> 02:36:46.516]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:46.516 --> 02:36:47.156]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:47.156 --> 02:36:47.756]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:47.756 --> 02:36:48.457]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:48.457 --> 02:36:49.438]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:49.438 --> 02:36:49.978]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:49.978 --> 02:36:50.678]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:50.678 --> 02:36:51.899]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:51.899 --> 02:36:52.660]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:53.440]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:54.681]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:54.681 --> 02:36:55.902]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:55.902 --> 02:36:56.483]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:56.483 --> 02:36:56.943]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:56.943 --> 02:36:58.584]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:58.584 --> 02:36:59.184]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:59.184 --> 02:36:59.665]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:36:59.665 --> 02:37:00.365]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:37:00.365 --> 02:37:01.386]  Get the f*** outta here!
[02:37:01.386 --> 02:37:01.986]  Get the f*** outta here
[02:37:03.755 --> 02:37:04.395]  To control us.
[02:37:04.395 --> 02:37:06.096]  They're trying to start a civil war.
[02:37:06.096 --> 02:37:07.116]  To ban free speech.
[02:37:07.116 --> 02:37:08.536]  To ban public gatherings.
[02:37:08.536 --> 02:37:11.217]  They're doing it on YouTube.
[02:37:11.217 --> 02:37:12.837]  They're giving it exciting music.
[02:37:12.837 --> 02:37:14.277]  Look, here's the police.
[02:37:14.277 --> 02:37:15.738]  Look at the police.
[02:37:15.738 --> 02:37:17.118]  There's hundreds of them over there.
[02:37:17.118 --> 02:37:20.579]  Watching as this happens.
[02:37:20.579 --> 02:37:23.159]  And then finally they tackle some woman that attacks them.
[02:37:23.159 --> 02:37:24.860]  This virtue signaling lady.
[02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:25.940]  Wow.
[02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:27.500]  And the police get them out.
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.261]  But they didn't do that in Charlotte.
[02:37:30.428 --> 02:37:32.549]  But notice it was state police that were there.
[02:37:32.549 --> 02:37:33.690]  State police had to come in.
[02:37:33.690 --> 02:37:39.473]  You know, Gary Haven, we just had such a fun time talking to Diamond and Silk there.
[02:37:39.473 --> 02:37:41.053]  And I can just purely praise them.
[02:37:41.053 --> 02:37:44.515]  Free market, want to make America great, Christian ladies, love Trump.
[02:37:44.515 --> 02:37:45.956]  It feels so good to have that solidarity.
[02:37:46.696 --> 02:37:53.527]  Why can't we just come together and have that solidarity instead of just getting in our groups and letting Soros, a true Nazi collaborator, control us?
[02:37:53.527 --> 02:37:57.694]  Yeah, you know, we better figure this out because that's the only hope we have as a nation.
[02:37:57.694 --> 02:38:01.079]  You know, Alex, you and I are both Christians and we're called to love each other.
[02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:08.126]  And, you know, you see the love in those women's faces that were our guests earlier.
[02:38:08.126 --> 02:38:13.991]  We are united together for free speech, for freedom, for our families, and we've got to be focused on that.
[02:38:13.991 --> 02:38:20.297]  And you've got to realize the enemy out there, you know, they create control and order out of chaos.
[02:38:20.817 --> 02:38:22.198]  This is all by design.
[02:38:22.198 --> 02:38:30.323]  I tell you, it's so obvious now that you gotta almost blind to not, no offense to blind people, to not see that this is by design.
[02:38:30.323 --> 02:38:33.745]  You know, I'm interested in what Jason Kessler was about.
[02:38:33.745 --> 02:38:47.813]  You know, I saw a little bit of the motive, for example, pulling down the statue of Robert E. Lee, and I understand what that's about, but we really didn't get a clear message from their organization and their intent.
[02:38:48.493 --> 02:38:54.719]  And then he said it wasn't about being racial, but when you got... I mean, was the KKK welcome there then?
[02:38:54.719 --> 02:39:00.125]  I mean, let's find out from him, because regardless, if he doesn't have a right to free speech, nobody does.
[02:39:00.125 --> 02:39:05.931]  And the media is so anti-free speech, they'll run headlines, Jones defends white nationalist free speech.
[02:39:05.931 --> 02:39:09.495]  And I defend the New Black Panther Party that says kill all the white people.
[02:39:09.955 --> 02:39:14.717]  As long as, you know, I don't support him saying that, but they have the right to rally.
[02:39:14.717 --> 02:39:16.098]  But he's been attacked yet again.
[02:39:16.098 --> 02:39:21.480]  Jason Kessler, JasonKessler.net, the organizer of the biggest thing in the country and the world right now.
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:24.481]  You think nuclear war with North Korea mattered, but no, not that.
[02:39:24.481 --> 02:39:25.161]  It's all about this.
[02:39:25.161 --> 02:39:26.602]  So Jason Kessler, what's the latest?
[02:39:27.774 --> 02:39:42.031]  Okay, look Alex, what I tried to do was organize the chaotic element and sometimes politically incorrect element of the alt-right into a civil rights movement for white people because I felt like the time had come that we needed to have it.
[02:39:42.031 --> 02:39:44.174]  Was our opening step perfect?
[02:39:44.734 --> 02:39:45.555]  No, it wasn't.
[02:39:45.555 --> 02:39:54.101]  But what happened was there was a coordinated attack by the establishment to defame us and to defame President Trump by association.
[02:39:54.101 --> 02:39:57.563]  This is like Clarence Palmer talked about decades ago.
[02:39:57.563 --> 02:40:06.990]  This is a high-tech lynching, and I urge people not to feed into what the establishment is trying to pull on me, trying to pull on the alt-right.
[02:40:06.990 --> 02:40:08.851]  You need to have a fair assessment.
[02:40:09.452 --> 02:40:12.274]  We have put our word out there from the beginning.
[02:40:12.274 --> 02:40:13.996]  This was not a neo-Nazi rally.
[02:40:13.996 --> 02:40:21.524]  It was not even a white nationalist rally, even though I did invite some people who do identify as a white nationalist.
[02:40:21.524 --> 02:40:26.109]  What this rally was about was, number one, standing up for these monuments.
[02:40:26.289 --> 02:40:30.494]  Because it wasn't just the Robert E. Lee statue which is being taken down.
[02:40:30.494 --> 02:40:33.577]  They took down Christopher Columbus at Pepperdine University.
[02:40:33.577 --> 02:40:40.325]  They removed the bust of the white founders at King's College in London because it wouldn't be sensitive enough.
[02:40:40.325 --> 02:40:41.586]  And let me say this then.
[02:40:41.586 --> 02:40:45.371]  They've got to take down the pyramids because some of them were built by slaves.
[02:40:46.311 --> 02:40:51.393]  That's what I'm saying, but it's only being used as a cudgel to attack white people.
[02:40:51.393 --> 02:41:10.001]  These historical errors like slavery, or perhaps wars of conquest, these are things that everybody did, but historical revisionists are only using it to get... No, no, the leftist and globalists have turned it into an anti-white thing to use that as a political bully to make the voting bloc of whites submit
[02:41:10.561 --> 02:41:11.622]  Uh, to the cultural tyranny.
[02:41:11.622 --> 02:41:17.366]  Now if you don't submit your kid being taught how to have sex when they're five by the pedophile lobby, uh, you know, you're anti-gay.
[02:41:17.366 --> 02:41:18.948]  I mean, I understand how they extend it out.
[02:41:18.948 --> 02:41:25.493]  I'm saying the federally run... I mean, you understand that half the people in white nationalist groups are feds.
[02:41:25.493 --> 02:41:30.317]  The Southern Poverty Law Center has been caught running Elohim City, white supremacist compounds.
[02:41:30.317 --> 02:41:33.999]  I mean, did you know, you know, about the Jewish guy that got caught attacking Jewish cemeteries?
[02:41:33.999 --> 02:41:35.421]  They were blaming on Trump supporters.
[02:41:35.421 --> 02:41:35.601]  I mean...
[02:41:36.442 --> 02:41:45.394]  All I'm saying is they use all this and all these old images of guys in, you know, white nationalist symbols and stuff as a way to project that onto Trump.
[02:41:45.394 --> 02:41:46.856]  It's actually trying to bring the country together.
[02:41:47.679 --> 02:41:50.300]  Yeah, those were false flags, Alex.
[02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:57.062]  Like this Nazi swastika that was put out there in the media, I never saw anybody with that.
[02:41:57.062 --> 02:42:03.405]  And I explicitly told people, do not bring KKK, do not bring Nazi symbolism to this rally.
[02:42:03.405 --> 02:42:05.085]  That is not what we are about.
[02:42:05.085 --> 02:42:09.507]  People who did that stuff did it in defiance of my orders.
[02:42:09.967 --> 02:42:10.087]  Yeah.
[02:42:23.442 --> 02:42:37.771]  Confederate heritage, American heritage supporters, I swear to God, if you looked in that part before they dispersed us and forced this chaos, there were, you know, like elderly people in there, you know, just waiting to hear some speeches.
[02:42:37.771 --> 02:42:40.512]  Kessler, Kessler, let me ask you this.
[02:42:40.512 --> 02:42:42.494]  Are you part of any foundations?
[02:42:42.494 --> 02:42:43.574]  Have you ever worked for the feds?
[02:42:43.574 --> 02:42:45.035]  Were you part of Occupy?
[02:42:45.035 --> 02:42:46.196]  Were you an Obama supporter?
[02:42:47.965 --> 02:42:50.226]  At one time, I supported Obama.
[02:42:50.226 --> 02:42:51.487]  I regret it now.
[02:42:51.487 --> 02:43:02.232]  I did not see the error of my ways until about two years ago when the shootings started happening and they were blaming everything on the racist police at that time.
[02:43:02.232 --> 02:43:04.693]  And I knew that the crime statistics were off.
[02:43:04.693 --> 02:43:11.757]  I felt like a lot of the other identity politics stuff with pushing the gender wage gap, that was off.
[02:43:11.757 --> 02:43:12.317]  I knew it was.
[02:43:13.377 --> 02:43:13.657]  Wow.
[02:43:13.657 --> 02:43:15.558]  Well, Jason, do you understand the cut-out here?
[02:43:31.364 --> 02:43:31.625]  I'm
[02:43:48.686 --> 02:44:16.087]  So, there you go, and I'm telling you, I'm going to dig all the old videos up and shove it down Raw Story, everybody else's throats, they're saying I'm anti-Semitic now, because I said I've gone out to rallies, and later, KKK leaders turned out to be federal informants, and turned out to be leading KKK groups, and then they had Jewish groups, literally like they got it from leftover stuff from Raiders of the Lost Ark, actual SA Nazi uniforms, and it was clearly, and it came out that that's what that was, it was fake.
[02:44:16.607 --> 02:44:19.648]  So I'm going to put it all together again, if everybody approves that.
[02:44:19.648 --> 02:44:21.148]  And they go, oh, you're saying Jews or Nazis?
[02:44:21.148 --> 02:44:27.690]  No, I'm saying some leftist groups, you know, Anglos, black, white, Hispanic, Jewish, they go out and do false flags.
[02:44:27.690 --> 02:44:29.630]  Most of these attacks are false flags.
[02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:33.111]  And so I'm saying here you are, a well-spoken guy that's part of Occupy.
[02:44:33.111 --> 02:44:35.692]  That's deep globalist liberal ideology.
[02:44:35.692 --> 02:44:37.572]  Then you're part of Obama's support.
[02:44:37.572 --> 02:44:43.814]  And then suddenly you realize you can't beat the nationalist patriot movement that's going to bring everybody together with
[02:44:45.074 --> 02:44:48.881]  The leftist ideology that is racist against minorities and wants to control them.
[02:44:48.881 --> 02:44:58.398]  You couldn't defeat them that way and so you went and set all this up and it was all perfectly ready and timed and meant to cause this to try to bring down Trump.
[02:44:59.784 --> 02:45:00.905]  No, absolutely not.
[02:45:00.905 --> 02:45:01.925]  I am a Trump supporter.
[02:45:01.925 --> 02:45:04.967]  I've been a right-wing person for about two years.
[02:45:04.967 --> 02:45:11.171]  I'm not your traditional conservative, but like I said, just like Donald Trump, I was a Democrat at one time and I moved over.
[02:45:11.171 --> 02:45:13.693]  People have a change of opinion.
[02:45:13.693 --> 02:45:17.355]  As far as the Occupy stuff, I was interested in that at the time.
[02:45:17.355 --> 02:45:18.336]  I was never one of these
[02:45:18.536 --> 02:45:19.256]  We're good to go.
[02:45:46.966 --> 02:45:50.370]  So I still have this very much distrust of power.
[02:46:09.031 --> 02:46:12.435]  I called him a federal guy forever, and it came out in his email he was a fed.
[02:46:12.435 --> 02:46:15.318]  He went to prison, came out in federal court, he was a fed.
[02:46:15.318 --> 02:46:20.944]  I want to warn you, Kessler, particularly, if you are a fed, they're going to burn you in the end.
[02:46:20.944 --> 02:46:22.046]  So you're in grave danger.
[02:46:22.910 --> 02:46:23.310]  I'm not.
[02:46:23.310 --> 02:46:25.872]  Alex, don't spread stuff like that without evidence.
[02:46:25.872 --> 02:46:26.713]  Come on, man.
[02:46:26.713 --> 02:46:33.397]  Like, at that press conference yesterday, I went by myself because I didn't want to endanger other people.
[02:46:33.397 --> 02:46:38.420]  Other people who've worked with me are, you know, they're having their jobs threatened.
[02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:40.622]  Why'd you choose a city with a Democrat mayor?
[02:46:41.022 --> 02:46:50.087]  You should see the emails and the phone calls that I get non-stop, day and night, threatening my life, threatening my family's lives.
[02:46:50.087 --> 02:46:56.791]  And I walked through a crowd of about 100 Antifa and Black Lives Matter to get to that press conference yesterday.
[02:46:56.791 --> 02:46:58.432]  I was ready to die, Alex.
[02:46:58.432 --> 02:47:00.453]  I was ready to die for what I believed in.
[02:47:00.453 --> 02:47:03.034]  And I thought somebody was going to stab me or shoot me.
[02:47:03.034 --> 02:47:06.296]  And nobody in their right mind would ever
[02:47:06.856 --> 02:47:14.599]  Ever, ever go into a situation like what I went into yesterday where I didn't have police protection and risk their life.
[02:47:14.599 --> 02:47:19.321]  I've got to hand it to you, nobody's denying, nobody's denying there aren't a bunch of crazies out there.
[02:47:19.321 --> 02:47:21.622]  And I'm not accusing you of being a Fed, sir.
[02:47:21.622 --> 02:47:25.864]  What I'm saying is, do you recognize that nine times out of ten or more
[02:47:26.684 --> 02:47:38.315]  The attacks on Jewish centers, black churches, dormitories, it always turns out to be leftists doing it, and we keep catching the right-wing groups being led by the left.
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:43.263]  Well, absolutely, those false flag elements all the time.
[02:47:43.263 --> 02:47:57.515]  I don't know that the leadership of movements are really leftist co-conspirators, as you say, but certainly I've seen a lot of articles on Breitbart, for instance, that have done a great job of cataloging all these times when they say that there's a supposed
[02:47:59.637 --> 02:48:00.818]  It's almost totally fake.
[02:48:00.818 --> 02:48:07.281]  To find a real KKK member that can actually talk or get out of their mother's trailer is very rare.
[02:48:07.281 --> 02:48:08.922]  Every major group that gets in trouble is led by a fed.
[02:48:26.992 --> 02:48:30.355]  Yeah, I'll tell you, I'll give you an example of that, Alex.
[02:48:30.355 --> 02:48:41.446]  Right when I started the Unite the Right rally, they knew, the powers that be knew that this was too powerful of a movement and they wanted to defame us with federal informants and there are those people out there.
[02:48:41.446 --> 02:48:47.933]  So the same damn day that my rally was announced, a KKK rally was announced for July 8th.
[02:48:48.573 --> 02:48:50.455]  Because they're trying to create and make it racial.
[02:49:13.456 --> 02:49:14.137]  I can only say that what
[02:49:32.006 --> 02:49:38.370]  The city did, when they forced people out of that park that way, created an atmosphere of chaos.
[02:49:38.370 --> 02:49:40.772]  I'm watching these videos.
[02:49:40.772 --> 02:49:51.118]  I don't know who this guy is or what his motivations are, but my instinct is I'm seeing this guy slowly pulling through this road.
[02:49:51.118 --> 02:49:52.219]  He doesn't seem like he's
[02:49:53.254 --> 02:50:14.445]  Like gunning it from the beginning, then people take some bats or some other implement to it, and maybe this guy freaked out, had a fight or flight, he either got scared or he got angry really quickly, and he drove, and when he did, he hit these people, then there were all these folks who were obviously waiting around the area, smashing it with baseball bats.
[02:50:14.785 --> 02:50:16.506]  Well, he was white, so he deserved it.
[02:50:16.506 --> 02:50:21.848]  See, that's where I get mad at all the racists, including white folks, that attack whites if they see him.
[02:50:21.848 --> 02:50:25.990]  Whites do get attacked all over the country driving through these riots and drug out and even killed.
[02:50:25.990 --> 02:50:27.230]  The media just shuts it down.
[02:50:27.230 --> 02:50:30.852]  And at first they were saying his car was attacked, he panicked and did it.
[02:50:30.852 --> 02:50:32.492]  Now they're saying that's not the case.
[02:50:32.492 --> 02:50:33.573]  He doesn't look like it.
[02:50:33.573 --> 02:50:35.574]  That's because of political pressure.
[02:50:35.574 --> 02:50:41.376]  Just like when the Muslims do this stuff and they try and cover for them, this is not the case.
[02:50:41.376 --> 02:50:43.277]  Jason Kessler, Muslims have never done anything.
[02:50:44.195 --> 02:50:46.176]  Muslims have never committed a single crime.
[02:50:46.176 --> 02:50:48.777]  Now you stop with your conspiracy theories.
[02:50:48.777 --> 02:50:50.438]  We'll be right back with Jason Kessler.
[02:50:50.438 --> 02:50:51.099]  Stay with us.

[02:52:52.274 --> 02:52:57.597]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:52:57.597 --> 02:52:59.178]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:52:59.178 --> 02:53:07.523]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:53:58.954 --> 02:54:03.944]  Gary Haven's gonna be hosting the broadcast Thursday in studio with Roger Stone.
[02:54:03.944 --> 02:54:06.209]  I'm gonna be hosting from the road.
[02:54:08.274 --> 02:54:10.415]  You can stand me up.
[02:54:10.415 --> 02:54:16.456]  We are also selling his powerful film, and I'm also in, Amerageddon, at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:16.456 --> 02:54:19.597]  That gets into this whole dark sky, black sky scenario.
[02:54:19.597 --> 02:54:23.918]  We're going to be middle of the North Korea situation, obviously, by Thursday.
[02:54:23.918 --> 02:54:27.139]  They're set tomorrow or the next day to fire missiles at Guam.
[02:54:27.139 --> 02:54:31.740]  And Trump's saying he may respond militarily, hitting the North Korean mainland.
[02:54:31.740 --> 02:54:34.841]  This is the time to be getting on our knees and praying.
[02:54:34.841 --> 02:54:35.981]  And look, coming together.
[02:54:37.342 --> 02:54:44.247]  But sure they're filling all these other groups full of racism, sure minorities, but just as racist as any white grand dragon.
[02:54:44.247 --> 02:54:47.410]  And the left wants that to put us under their control.
[02:54:47.410 --> 02:54:49.151]  Does that mean people shouldn't respond to it?
[02:54:49.151 --> 02:54:58.559]  All I know is they're trying to shut me off with Tom Brokaw going on TV saying Alex Jones is a quote, unalloyed, that means total racist.
[02:54:59.793 --> 02:55:05.438]  That doesn't hurt me because that's an old race baiter using rates to control people for 45 years on air.
[02:55:05.438 --> 02:55:05.998]  He's a joke.
[02:55:05.998 --> 02:55:06.499]  He's a lie.
[02:55:06.499 --> 02:55:07.339]  He discredits himself.
[02:55:07.339 --> 02:55:09.261]  But they need this narrative to work.
[02:55:09.261 --> 02:55:12.083]  They've been saying all the Republicans are racist for years.
[02:55:12.083 --> 02:55:13.785]  If you want to cut taxes, you're racist.
[02:55:13.785 --> 02:55:15.146]  If you don't want Obamacare, you're racist.
[02:55:16.641 --> 02:55:18.263]  And so they need this.
[02:55:18.263 --> 02:55:19.424]  They need this race war.
[02:55:19.424 --> 02:55:20.825]  They need this crisis.
[02:55:20.825 --> 02:55:21.926]  They need this division.
[02:55:21.926 --> 02:55:26.650]  I say we shouldn't give Antifa the type of situations they want.
[02:55:26.650 --> 02:55:34.458]  But then I get we're seeing folks have their First Amendment eradicated, like when he got attacked for a second time yesterday, Mr. Kessler.
[02:55:34.458 --> 02:55:36.319]  So that's a question for CNN and the rest of them.
[02:55:36.319 --> 02:55:38.782]  Do you, Jason Kessler, have a First Amendment?
[02:55:40.254 --> 02:55:44.079]  It doesn't seem like I do anymore, and that's a very big problem, Alex.
[02:55:44.079 --> 02:55:51.009]  A federal court judge ruled that the city of Charlottesville was discriminating against me, and unite the right based on the content of our speech.
[02:55:51.009 --> 02:55:54.834]  Even the ACLU, who completely disagrees with us on everything else,
[02:55:55.234 --> 02:55:55.734]  We're good to go.
[02:56:22.066 --> 02:56:25.168]  But they really messed up to get it done.
[02:56:25.168 --> 02:56:35.573]  There is collusion between the Charlottesville city government and, I believe, Terry McAuliffe, and we are going to be raising money for a legal defense.
[02:56:35.573 --> 02:56:38.395]  We're going to make sure all of this gets investigated.
[02:56:38.395 --> 02:56:47.900]  I want, if anybody in the Trump administration is listening, Mr. Sessions, whoever, the real civil rights abuses happened against the attendees of our rally.
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:54.243]  Well, it also happened to the reporters from InfoWars, The Hill, women being attacked.
[02:56:54.243 --> 02:56:59.846]  I mean, we need to focus in on why is the MSM protecting the anti-fascist scum.
[02:56:59.846 --> 02:57:02.227]  Forget the debate about who's good, who's bad.
[02:57:02.227 --> 02:57:08.150]  The government at a criminal level is pushing this, and Jason Kessler, I agree with you on that, but I think that
[02:57:09.349 --> 02:57:12.571]  You should have a unity rally against racism, period.
[02:57:12.571 --> 02:57:30.204]  Racism against whites, blacks, Hispanics, everybody, and ask everybody to come together, and that would be world-changing news if you had KKK guys coming and taking their rubs off who were real KKK, that didn't really exist, and apologizing, and the black nationalists apologizing, and realizing George Soros is the enemy.
[02:57:30.204 --> 02:57:32.986]  That would be the answer, and that's how we're going to move forward, because the globalists
[02:57:33.146 --> 02:57:35.648]  I think that that's a bit idealistic and naive.
[02:57:35.648 --> 02:57:47.519]  I mean, every time Republicans try and take the moral high ground and say, we're not going to play into the identity politics, the NAACP, the Al Sharpton's, the will keep extracting blood from us and blood from us and blood from us.
[02:57:47.519 --> 02:57:51.963]  There has to be somebody who is willing to say nothing against the other groups of people.
[02:57:51.963 --> 02:57:53.204]  They have a right to exist.
[02:57:53.204 --> 02:57:56.748]  They have a right to have liberties, but white people need defenders too.
[02:57:57.588 --> 02:58:02.710]  Well, I'm not saying that there shouldn't be groups and organizations that, you know, say that whites have a right to heritage and culture.
[02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:04.490]  I know they're trying to extinct it.
[02:58:04.490 --> 02:58:09.092]  The globalists want to extinct all real cultures so they can override it with a synthetic globalism.
[02:58:09.092 --> 02:58:20.955]  But, you see, I'm saying you should have a rally, bring everybody together who calls for a peace rally, and have people just accept each other as humans and say, I will honor you and appreciate you.
[02:58:20.955 --> 02:58:24.056]  And then if the racist minority groups don't want to come, that's their problem.
[02:58:24.056 --> 02:58:25.657]  You then have the moral high ground.
[02:58:25.657 --> 02:58:26.417]  Jason Kessler.
[02:58:27.117 --> 02:58:28.778]  I challenge you to have that rally.
[02:58:28.778 --> 02:58:29.839]  Please keep checking in with us.
[02:58:29.839 --> 02:58:32.741]  I appreciate you having the courage to join us.
[02:58:32.741 --> 02:58:33.902]  And you do have courage.
[02:58:33.902 --> 02:58:36.724]  The Antifa is so controlled, they won't come on.
[02:58:36.724 --> 02:58:38.465]  We'll be right back with the 4th Hour.
[02:58:38.465 --> 02:58:39.666]  Stay with us, Owen Schroer and more.

[02:59:43.865 --> 02:59:49.646]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:49.646 --> 02:59:54.708]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.499 --> 03:00:20.200]  It all happened on Soros birthday.
[03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:21.121]  The police stood down.
[03:00:21.121 --> 03:00:22.582]  The mayor ordered it.
[03:00:22.582 --> 03:00:23.382]  A car came in.
[03:00:23.382 --> 03:00:25.344]  It was all choreographed.
[03:00:25.344 --> 03:00:34.149]  Then you got a guy who was the anti-fug, Obama supporter, occupied.
[03:00:34.149 --> 03:00:35.750]  Total Soros funding.
[03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:38.152]  He now is the leader of the white nationalists.
[03:00:39.148 --> 03:00:39.568]  I don't know.
[03:00:39.568 --> 03:00:48.371]  I was talking to Gary during the break saying, this looks bad, and then you add Soros' birthday, and now the media's all lined up to go crazy.
[03:00:48.371 --> 03:00:50.172]  The mystery of evil?
[03:00:50.172 --> 03:00:52.053]  Nothing happens by coincidence.
[03:00:52.053 --> 03:01:03.217]  This was a very, very well orchestrated event, including the suspicious killing that had to take place to bring this up to the international news level and the level of hate
[03:01:03.957 --> 03:01:04.598]  That's right.
[03:01:20.737 --> 03:01:21.338]  Something like that.
[03:01:21.338 --> 03:01:22.659]  Remember at the beginning of the summer?
[03:01:22.659 --> 03:01:23.440]  Summer Rage.
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:24.000]  Summer Rage.
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:25.442]  And I'm sure, boom, it's taking so long.
[03:01:25.442 --> 03:01:26.803]  There it is.
[03:01:26.803 --> 03:01:27.884]  They're not that quick in there.
[03:01:27.884 --> 03:01:28.805]  They're quick, but not that quick.
[03:01:28.805 --> 03:01:29.846]  That just happened by accident.
[03:01:29.846 --> 03:01:30.667]  There we are.
[03:01:30.667 --> 03:01:34.631]  So we've had, at least the end of the summer, a true rage event.
[03:01:34.631 --> 03:01:36.613]  It's like they're making up for lost ground.
[03:01:36.613 --> 03:01:39.596]  And I'm sick of somebody shoots somebody with a gun, then I'm responsible.
[03:01:39.596 --> 03:01:42.199]  Or some white guy runs somebody over, I'm responsible.
[03:01:42.719 --> 03:01:49.764]  Now, if you're part of the same church, the same mosque, the same ideology, you're calling for it, and then somebody at your church or mosque kills somebody, well, then you are part of it.
[03:01:49.764 --> 03:01:59.431]  But just to say that, oh, one person got killed, it's the alt-right's fault, it's the police and the mayor, for they're paid, they have a duty, they've sworn an oath, dereliction of duty.
[03:01:59.431 --> 03:02:01.313]  That mayor needs to go to prison.
[03:02:01.773 --> 03:02:13.296]  And I tell you, George Soros needs to be investigated and I believe charged with sedition for organizing and funding this for the purpose of creating this violence between people.
[03:02:13.296 --> 03:02:19.078]  That old bastard needs to get his due and we have a president that's just the man to do it.
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:27.823]  You know, this guy may be real, though, because so many of the leftists that are anti-racist, I find, behind the scenes, they kind of flip back and forth and say racist stuff.
[03:02:27.823 --> 03:02:29.124]  It's like a dual thing.
[03:02:29.124 --> 03:02:31.604]  Those that are guilty about it, so they want to play both sides.
[03:02:31.604 --> 03:02:33.685]  It's more like an opportunistic thing.
[03:02:36.291 --> 03:02:45.954]  Then some folks, you know, get into the left, think they want to do right, and they see how racist the left is, and they go, oh, I'll just join the other side, because they were already kind of racially based.
[03:02:45.954 --> 03:02:46.114]  Yeah.
[03:02:46.114 --> 03:02:49.475]  Whereas I'm just based on what you do and what you stand for.
[03:02:49.475 --> 03:02:50.836]  It's peculiar.
[03:02:50.836 --> 03:03:00.339]  You know, seeing his face and listening, well, we didn't actually see his face, but on the video, and when he went yesterday to the press event and was attacked,
[03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:05.542]  Interesting set of events.
[03:03:05.542 --> 03:03:09.444]  But you can't swing a stick at a white supremacist meeting and not hit a Fed.
[03:03:09.444 --> 03:03:10.925]  Yeah, that's true.
[03:03:10.925 --> 03:03:13.826]  All right, you're hosting Thursday.
[03:03:13.826 --> 03:03:14.827]  Sounds great.
[03:03:14.827 --> 03:03:15.727]  Thank you, sir.
[03:03:15.727 --> 03:03:17.188]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:03:17.188 --> 03:03:19.009]  Please support us financially.
[03:03:19.009 --> 03:03:20.950]  I didn't even plug last hour.
[03:03:20.950 --> 03:03:22.591]  We've got the biggest sales in our history.
[03:03:22.591 --> 03:03:23.732]  They just keep getting bigger.
[03:03:23.732 --> 03:03:28.454]  I'm combining last month's MAGA sale, some of the stuff came back in that sold out, with the new 1776 special.
[03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:32.696]  Everything is between 30 and 66 percent off.
[03:03:35.322 --> 03:03:36.942]  You cannot beat these deals.
[03:03:36.942 --> 03:03:38.963]  These are our all-time best deals.
[03:03:38.963 --> 03:03:41.563]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, 66% off.
[03:03:41.563 --> 03:03:43.304]  Mico ZX, 46% off.
[03:03:43.304 --> 03:03:45.024]  Brain Forge, 55% off.
[03:03:45.024 --> 03:03:46.724]  Survival Shield, 55% off.
[03:03:46.724 --> 03:03:48.685]  Secret 12, 55% off.
[03:03:48.685 --> 03:04:00.907]  The BuzzFeed group promoting this said the best final of the B12 is $35, and that we're bad for selling it for $17.76, when ours is private-labeled by the very group they chose to say, here's the best, and here's Alex's.
[03:04:00.907 --> 03:04:02.948]  I mean, that's just providence that that happened.
[03:04:03.688 --> 03:04:05.889]  So Buzzfeed just says we are the best, the cleanest.
[03:04:05.889 --> 03:04:07.169]  We're just absolutely.
[03:04:07.169 --> 03:04:09.490]  And then they're just frothing, don't even know what to do.
[03:04:09.490 --> 03:04:10.550]  So please support us.
[03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:11.430]  As you know, there's a war.
[03:04:11.430 --> 03:04:12.671]  We're trying to shut everybody down.
[03:04:12.671 --> 03:04:13.831]  Please pray for us.
[03:04:13.831 --> 03:04:18.952]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:04:18.952 --> 03:04:22.753]  Got the Super Blue Fluoride Free with the Colloidal Silver and Iodine Toothpaste Pack.
[03:04:22.753 --> 03:04:26.894]  And the Children's Inn as well as the new Super Blue Mouthwash that is amazing.
[03:04:26.894 --> 03:04:28.975]  It's 50% off in the Super Silver Pack.
[03:04:29.415 --> 03:04:32.980]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:04:32.980 --> 03:04:37.225]  Just make the commitment to buy the products, to spread the articles, to spread the videos.
[03:04:37.225 --> 03:04:38.066]  We can't be stopped.
[03:04:38.066 --> 03:04:46.076]  And I almost forgot to tell you, there's a new article up on Newswars.com that Kid Daniels put up that catches CNN and more fake news against Trump.
[03:04:47.017 --> 03:04:48.418]  Why is the fungus?
[03:04:48.418 --> 03:04:49.499]  Why is the mold?
[03:04:49.499 --> 03:04:51.240]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[03:04:51.240 --> 03:04:52.201]  What is going on?
[03:04:52.201 --> 03:04:52.981]  What has changed?
[03:05:17.277 --> 03:05:18.698]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[03:05:18.698 --> 03:05:19.718]  I want to get your reviews.
[03:05:19.718 --> 03:05:20.679]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[03:05:20.679 --> 03:05:22.140]  For me, it's been incredible.
[03:05:22.140 --> 03:05:26.662]  MycoZX, antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[03:05:26.662 --> 03:05:27.482]  Get it today.
[03:05:27.482 --> 03:05:27.982]  Limited run.
[03:05:27.982 --> 03:05:29.383]  It'll be months till we get more.
[03:05:29.383 --> 03:05:34.046]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:05:34.046 --> 03:05:37.387]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[03:05:37.387 --> 03:05:39.708]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[03:05:39.708 --> 03:05:41.609]  Look at the response we're getting.
[03:05:41.609 --> 03:05:43.070]  We're changing the world together.
[03:05:43.070 --> 03:05:44.070]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:05:44.070 --> 03:05:44.831]  God bless you all.
[03:05:46.775 --> 03:05:51.438]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:05:51.438 --> 03:06:04.405]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:06:04.405 --> 03:06:10.969]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:06:10.969 --> 03:06:13.430]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[03:06:13.490 --> 03:06:24.719]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:06:24.719 --> 03:06:27.081]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[03:06:27.081 --> 03:06:28.562]  We're getting results.
[03:06:28.562 --> 03:06:34.667]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[03:06:34.667 --> 03:06:37.549]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[03:06:37.549 --> 03:06:42.533]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com
[03:06:45.116 --> 03:06:50.961]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:50.961 --> 03:06:52.422]  We've been sold out for months.
[03:06:52.422 --> 03:06:57.486]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:57.486 --> 03:07:01.490]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[03:07:01.630 --> 03:07:06.152]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[03:07:06.152 --> 03:07:11.295]  But BioTrue Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[03:07:11.295 --> 03:07:14.777]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[03:07:14.777 --> 03:07:18.799]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[03:07:18.959 --> 03:07:27.003]  BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger for Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[03:07:27.003 --> 03:07:31.906]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTruth Selenium before we sell it again.

[03:07:40.991 --> 03:07:43.052]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[03:07:43.052 --> 03:07:44.573]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[03:07:44.573 --> 03:07:45.714]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:08:03.117 --> 03:08:07.579]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:08:07.579 --> 03:08:10.781]  Welcome into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:10.781 --> 03:08:11.922]  I was honestly shocked.
[03:08:11.922 --> 03:08:13.482]  We all know about fake news.
[03:08:13.482 --> 03:08:15.844]  We all know how fake news works.
[03:08:15.844 --> 03:08:17.485]  We've all seen it in real time.
[03:08:18.626 --> 03:08:22.752]  We know about the people like Jake Tapper and the likes of Don Lemon.
[03:08:22.752 --> 03:08:32.908]  But I really couldn't believe it when I saw the New York Times and the Washington Post and all of television media over the weekend saying President Trump is yet to disavow.
[03:08:33.909 --> 03:08:44.296]  Racial violence in Charlottesville, even though he put out multiple tweets, literally multiple tweets, and yet they still claimed that that had not happened.
[03:08:44.296 --> 03:08:47.698]  It was truly something to behold, fake news.
[03:08:47.698 --> 03:08:57.525]  Now, I'm about to be joined by Vijay Chokalingam, and I want to be clear with all of the race baiting stuff going on, this is not why he's on the show.
[03:08:57.525 --> 03:09:00.727]  In fact, he's actually an expert in this field.
[03:09:00.727 --> 03:09:03.069]  Vijay Chokalingam, you may have heard his story.
[03:09:03.709 --> 03:09:09.672]  The author of Almost Black, I got into medical school by saying I was black.
[03:09:09.672 --> 03:09:10.493]  I lied.
[03:09:10.493 --> 03:09:15.215]  Now, Vijay is also, he is in the admissions industry, so he has a background in this.
[03:09:15.215 --> 03:09:17.597]  Vijay, thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:09:17.597 --> 03:09:19.058]  It's a pleasure to be on.
[03:09:19.058 --> 03:09:27.082]  So first, for starters, let me ask you, what motivated you to pretend to be black to get into medical school?
[03:09:27.082 --> 03:09:28.303]  What was the motivating factor?
[03:09:29.238 --> 03:09:29.799]  Sure.
[03:09:29.799 --> 03:09:42.752]  Back in 1999, I was a hard-partying college frat boy, and I started to freak out about my own chances of getting into medical school, and especially after all my Indian American friends got rejected.
[03:09:42.752 --> 03:09:52.081]  So it happens to be that I studied statistics at the University of Chicago, so I looked at the data that was published by the American Association of Medical Colleges, and I came to a really odd conclusion.
[03:09:52.839 --> 03:09:58.524]  Which is that it was a lot easier for me to get in as a Black American than as an Asian American.
[03:09:58.524 --> 03:10:03.088]  I'm a dark-skinned South Indian, as you can see if you look at me.
[03:10:03.088 --> 03:10:12.496]  So I came up with the scam of shaving my head, trimming my eyelashes, and joining the Organization of Black Students and applying to medical school as an African American.
[03:10:13.260 --> 03:10:26.094]  And despite the fact that I had a very low 3.1 GPA, I managed to get waitlisted at Washington University and the University of Pennsylvania, those are the third and fourth best medical schools in the country, as well as getting into St.
[03:10:26.094 --> 03:10:34.022]  Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri, despite the fact that my 3.1 GPA was dramatically lower than their average of 3.7.
[03:10:35.991 --> 03:10:45.900]  So I discovered that it was a lot easier to get into a top college or graduate school as an African-American than it is as an Asian-American.
[03:10:45.900 --> 03:10:51.865]  Now were you shocked or were you worried at all that they might come back at you and look into your background?
[03:10:51.865 --> 03:10:55.247]  Or were you worried that somebody might say you're fudging these reports?
[03:10:55.247 --> 03:10:57.429]  What were your thoughts on that?
[03:10:57.429 --> 03:11:03.815]  The climax of the book is actually in a medical school interview where they actually confronted me about lying about my race.
[03:11:04.476 --> 03:11:09.064]  And my response was, I don't want to talk about my ethnic background.
[03:11:09.064 --> 03:11:15.356]  I want to talk about my qualifications to be a physician, which I think is the entire point of my book.
[03:11:16.047 --> 03:11:21.931]  You know, you shouldn't judge people based upon their race, which is what the colleges and universities are doing right now.
[03:11:21.931 --> 03:11:33.797]  And I know that as an admissions consultant for InterviewSOS.com here in Los Angeles, is that, you know, race is an important factor in college and university and graduate school admissions, including medical school.
[03:11:33.797 --> 03:11:34.398]  And it shouldn't be.
[03:11:34.978 --> 03:11:41.465]  And the priorities here, is what you're saying, I would agree with you, is that the priority should be, do you meet the standards?
[03:11:41.465 --> 03:11:42.906]  Do you have the capabilities?
[03:11:42.906 --> 03:11:44.127]  Are you the best?
[03:11:44.127 --> 03:11:48.071]  It's not about what skin color you have, or this, that, or the other thing, or the politics involved.
[03:11:48.071 --> 03:11:50.093]  It's, are you the most qualified?
[03:11:50.093 --> 03:11:55.058]  And that's what you're saying, this system is not measuring people with that stick.
[03:11:55.834 --> 03:12:02.741]  I mean, I want to point out, you know, it is basically the way that affirmative action works, and a lot of people don't know that, is very simple.
[03:12:02.741 --> 03:12:09.909]  Okay, all of the data, wherever it's available on university admissions, shows that it's hardest to get into college or graduate school as an Asian American.
[03:12:09.909 --> 03:12:11.531]  It's slightly easier to get in.
[03:12:11.531 --> 03:12:13.673]  It's second hardest as a white person.
[03:12:13.673 --> 03:12:17.257]  It's third hardest as a Hispanic, and it's easiest as an Asian American.
[03:12:17.737 --> 03:12:20.098]  I'm sorry, as an African American.
[03:12:20.098 --> 03:12:30.201]  For example, a kid who applied to medical school in 2015 with a 3.1 GPA and 31 MCAT score had an 18% chance of admission as an Asian American, 36% as a white American, 56% as a Hispanic, and 76% as a black American.
[03:12:30.201 --> 03:12:31.761]  So it's a heck of a lot easier
[03:12:43.485 --> 03:12:50.147]  To get into college or grad school as an African-American than it is as a Asian-American.
[03:12:50.147 --> 03:12:52.408]  But it's also harder for white people as well.
[03:12:52.408 --> 03:13:00.530]  Well, and again, you're not just saying this because you had the experience, you wrote the book, Almost Black, but you also are in the admissions industry.
[03:13:00.530 --> 03:13:01.691]  You know about this stuff.
[03:13:01.691 --> 03:13:06.192]  I'm just curious, is anyone else, Vijay, that you work with, does anyone else have the same concerns?
[03:13:06.192 --> 03:13:07.692]  Is anyone else raising this awareness?
[03:13:07.692 --> 03:13:10.033]  Does anybody else even care?
[03:13:10.033 --> 03:13:11.433]  Our president cares.
[03:13:11.433 --> 03:13:12.894]  Our president cares a lot.
[03:13:13.782 --> 03:13:25.969]  You know, President Trump famously, you know, criticized President Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren for exploiting and supporting Harvard's racist affirmative action policies.
[03:13:25.969 --> 03:13:30.072]  President Trump famously called Senator Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas.
[03:13:30.743 --> 03:13:39.289]  Because she pretended to be a Native American in order to improve her chances of getting a faculty position at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard.
[03:13:39.289 --> 03:13:44.433]  So this is an issue our president is very concerned about and recently you've cited the New York Times article.
[03:13:44.433 --> 03:13:55.141]  The New York Times tries to portray it as a white versus black issue but the truth is the people who are hurt the most by affirmative action ironically are Asian Americans and the lawsuit that
[03:13:56.262 --> 03:14:05.290]  Attorney General Sessions is looking into is to end affirmative action at top universities by potentially cutting off their federal funding.
[03:14:05.290 --> 03:14:11.155]  It's my belief that President Trump will end affirmative action like Lincoln ended slavery.
[03:14:11.155 --> 03:14:16.000]  And the way he's going to do that is by appointing conservative anti-affirmative action Supreme Court judges.
[03:14:16.781 --> 03:14:25.247]  And by using the Department of Justice to force the universities to either end their racist affirmative action policies or give up their federal funding.
[03:14:25.247 --> 03:14:26.988]  Yeah, you mentioned the Supreme Court Justice.
[03:14:26.988 --> 03:14:30.050]  He nominated and got Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.
[03:14:30.050 --> 03:14:30.991]  I've got another story today.
[03:14:30.991 --> 03:14:32.051]  I'm going to cover this later.
[03:14:32.051 --> 03:14:37.935]  Trump has also quietly appointed a hundred other new judges to lifetime positions.
[03:14:37.935 --> 03:14:38.536]  But you know, it's funny.
[03:14:38.536 --> 03:14:43.299]  You brought up Elizabeth Warren and how she faked being a Native American to get into school.
[03:14:43.299 --> 03:14:45.160]  What was the name of her book that she wrote?
[03:14:45.160 --> 03:14:45.660]  Do you remember that?
[03:14:47.021 --> 03:14:48.122]  Oh, she didn't write a book.
[03:14:48.122 --> 03:14:50.884]  She genuinely was trying to scam the system and then lied about it.
[03:14:50.884 --> 03:14:51.564]  I'm sorry.
[03:14:51.564 --> 03:14:52.345]  I'm sorry, Vijay.
[03:14:52.345 --> 03:14:57.448]  I was remembering that you wrote the book, Almost Black, with your experience.
[03:14:57.448 --> 03:14:58.349]  But it's more than that.
[03:14:58.349 --> 03:15:00.470]  A lot of people do that.
[03:15:00.470 --> 03:15:09.496]  You know, Harvard recently like to brag about how they have 51% minority for the first time in their history, but like they're having like a parade to celebrate, but they don't realize you got a few.
[03:15:09.496 --> 03:15:12.698]  You can't forget about what we call the Pocahontas Factor.
[03:15:12.698 --> 03:15:16.461]  So you think that that's actually something that's happening more often than we think?
[03:15:17.281 --> 03:15:21.603]  Oh my, I'm not, you know, Elizabeth Warren and me are not the only ones.
[03:15:21.603 --> 03:15:25.665]  We're just the ones who got caught, you know, and revealed that fact.
[03:15:25.665 --> 03:15:29.307]  Well, you wrote a book, you know, I'm still waiting for her to publish her book.
[03:15:29.307 --> 03:15:29.887]  Yeah.
[03:15:29.887 --> 03:15:37.651]  No, I mean, that's why we're so fortunate to have such a great president who has the courage to confront with this type of racism.
[03:15:37.651 --> 03:15:39.052]  Well, it's amazing, you come on...
[03:15:40.123 --> 03:15:43.385]  I do want to mention, you know, I'm wearing my UCLA shirt right now.
[03:15:43.385 --> 03:15:47.048]  I dropped out of medical school at St.
[03:15:47.048 --> 03:15:52.991]  Louis University in Missouri, subsequently got my MBA at UCLA's Anderson School of Management.
[03:15:52.991 --> 03:15:56.694]  UCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions.
[03:15:56.694 --> 03:16:07.661]  I discovered that it's possible to have a great educational experience with a divert class of Asian Americans, whites, blacks, and Hispanics without practicing racial discrimination in the world.
[03:16:08.381 --> 03:16:08.941]  Shocking.
[03:16:38.445 --> 03:16:52.278]  She has a new baby on the way and, you know, I've come to the realization I'm going to say no comment because, you know, I certainly don't, you know, I don't want any to say or do anything that could be controlled as negatively towards my sister's child.
[03:16:52.278 --> 03:16:53.319]  So I'll just leave it at that.
[03:16:53.319 --> 03:16:54.841]  She disagrees with me on this issue.
[03:16:54.841 --> 03:16:59.845]  She believes that she benefited from the Affirmative Action Program at NBC.
[03:16:59.845 --> 03:17:03.409]  I also remember when she got rejected from Harvard, she cried.
[03:17:04.695 --> 03:17:16.958]  So, you know, it's important for us to realize that affirmative action hurts people as well as, you know, it hurts people a lot when they're applying to college and graduate school, including my sister and other members of my family as well.
[03:17:16.958 --> 03:17:17.738]  You know, it's amazing.
[03:17:17.738 --> 03:17:22.019]  This affirmative action thing is something that most people probably don't think about.
[03:17:22.019 --> 03:17:25.180]  They don't realize that it could be affecting their day-to-day lives.
[03:17:25.180 --> 03:17:27.301]  It could be affecting their futures.
[03:17:27.301 --> 03:17:29.001]  And it's something that most people don't talk about.
[03:17:29.778 --> 03:17:31.360]  Yeah, you know, I want to bring this up.
[03:17:31.360 --> 03:17:32.781]  I want to give a good piece of advice.
[03:17:32.781 --> 03:17:42.072]  As I mentioned, I'm an admissions consultant for InterviewSOS.com here in Los Angeles, and I want to give a piece of free advice as an admissions consultant to all of your listeners out there.
[03:17:42.907 --> 03:17:50.631]  And that is, do not disclose your race if you're Asian American or white, ever.
[03:17:50.631 --> 03:17:53.513]  There's almost always an option to not disclose your race.
[03:17:53.513 --> 03:17:54.974]  Don't disclose it.
[03:17:54.974 --> 03:18:01.778]  Because it can be shown to decrease your chances of finding a job or getting into college or graduate school.
[03:18:01.778 --> 03:18:06.320]  So there's never any reason to disclose your race if you're an Asian American or white.
[03:18:06.320 --> 03:18:07.461]  Just decline to say it.
[03:18:08.277 --> 03:18:12.578]  Now have you dealt with people that come to you for advice and you give them that advice?
[03:18:12.578 --> 03:18:15.138]  How do they take it?
[03:18:15.138 --> 03:18:16.639]  They follow it.
[03:18:16.639 --> 03:18:20.720]  They just say, you know what, I'm just going to not refuse to disclose my race.
[03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:26.561]  Alright, well you know what's going to happen now is they're going to come after you and say how racist you are.
[03:18:26.561 --> 03:18:31.822]  You know, I'm trying to fight a system of legalized racism that we call affirmative action.
[03:18:32.626 --> 03:18:41.650]  It's important to realize that affirmative action is a racial classification system that changes your chances of admission to college or graduate school.
[03:18:41.650 --> 03:18:46.612]  It is the very definition of racism.
[03:18:46.612 --> 03:18:53.695]  And we're very fortunate to have a president who is committed to appointing justices who will end this type of racism.
[03:18:53.695 --> 03:18:56.176]  But more broadly, you know,
[03:18:57.806 --> 03:19:04.510]  Martin Luther King famously said that black supremacy is as bad as white supremacy.
[03:19:04.510 --> 03:19:13.596]  And, you know, to discriminate against a white man or an Asian man is as bad as discriminating against a Hispanic or an African American.
[03:19:13.596 --> 03:19:19.820]  And I'm glad that we have a president who believes in that, who believes that all forms of racism are wrong.
[03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:31.112]  When President Trump says he's the least racist person, that's because he believes it's as wrong to discriminate against a white person as it is to discriminate against a Hispanic or a black.
[03:19:31.112 --> 03:19:34.433]  And most people are over the entire racism thing anyway.
[03:19:34.433 --> 03:19:38.474]  It's just a media-perpetuated lie to get us to go into civil war.
[03:19:38.474 --> 03:19:40.514]  Thank you so much for joining us, Vijay.
[03:19:40.514 --> 03:19:41.834]  Almost Black is the book.
[03:19:41.834 --> 03:19:43.995]  He exposes affirmative action in schools, folks.
[03:19:47.139 --> 03:19:51.601]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[03:19:51.601 --> 03:19:53.182]  Those times may be near.
[03:19:53.182 --> 03:19:54.102]  Think about it.
[03:19:54.102 --> 03:19:58.705]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[03:19:58.705 --> 03:20:03.347]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[03:20:03.687 --> 03:20:09.510]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[03:20:09.510 --> 03:20:16.214]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[03:20:16.214 --> 03:20:18.756]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[03:20:19.196 --> 03:20:21.998]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[03:21:46.520 --> 03:21:48.461]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:21:48.461 --> 03:21:53.782]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:21:53.782 --> 03:21:55.362]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:21:55.362 --> 03:22:03.704]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[03:25:28.071 --> 03:25:30.074]  We love our John Oliver Challenge.

[03:25:45.505 --> 03:25:47.826]  A lot of times we sell out of this stuff.
[03:25:47.826 --> 03:25:52.848]  You can see, I mean, Seeker 12 has like 3,000 ratings and a 4.8 star review.
[03:25:52.848 --> 03:25:55.729]  I think Brain Force and Survival Shield, the exact same story.
[03:25:55.729 --> 03:25:58.050]  So it's really just incredible, these products.
[03:25:58.050 --> 03:26:01.192]  And that's how you take us to the next level, folks.
[03:26:01.192 --> 03:26:01.912]  David Knight Show.
[03:26:02.776 --> 03:26:09.559]  We're about to be doing seven hours of live programming again, starting with David Knight, Real News.
[03:26:09.559 --> 03:26:12.560]  Let's open up the phone lines, because I want to hear what everybody thinks about Charlotte.
[03:26:12.560 --> 03:26:16.002]  I don't know if we've really heard from you, the listeners, out there yet.
[03:26:16.002 --> 03:26:16.842]  So, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:26:16.842 --> 03:26:16.922]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:26:16.922 --> 03:26:19.963]  What do you think about everything that happened this weekend?
[03:26:19.963 --> 03:26:22.764]  We know what the backdrop is, but where do you think it goes?
[03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:36.334]  So what you have, though, is you have an actual civil war going on in the deep state.
[03:26:36.334 --> 03:26:38.355]  There's a real civil war in the White House.
[03:26:38.355 --> 03:26:41.118]  There's a real power struggle in Washington.
[03:26:41.118 --> 03:26:50.865]  And it's all about the globalist New World Order either coming to fruition or being stopped.
[03:26:50.865 --> 03:26:54.368]  And so there's a huge civil war going on right now in Washington, D.C.
[03:26:54.368 --> 03:26:55.269]  But what you have
[03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:58.893]  is a bunch of LARPers.
[03:27:13.933 --> 03:27:18.838]  They don't actually have anything in real life that gives them fulfillment.
[03:27:18.838 --> 03:27:20.739]  They aren't part of a team.
[03:27:20.739 --> 03:27:23.161]  They aren't part of a group.
[03:27:23.161 --> 03:27:24.303]  They don't have anything.
[03:27:24.303 --> 03:27:26.344]  So they latch onto these things like...
[03:27:27.276 --> 03:27:41.081]  A Richard Spencer white supremacy march, and they think that now that they're grabbing a torch in unity with these white people, that they're told that they're being, you know, pushed out of society, cast out, now they're LARPing.
[03:27:41.081 --> 03:27:47.863]  They're actually out there thinking they're part of some white nationalist, some Nazi movement.
[03:27:47.863 --> 03:27:49.483]  No!
[03:27:49.483 --> 03:27:51.584]  No, that's not real.
[03:27:51.584 --> 03:27:52.444]  It's totally fake.
[03:27:52.444 --> 03:27:53.205]  It's all made up.
[03:27:53.205 --> 03:27:54.165]  And Richard Spencer,
[03:27:56.613 --> 03:28:01.158]  I mean, folks, I shouldn't have to come on here and denounce white supremacy.
[03:28:01.158 --> 03:28:03.540]  I shouldn't have to come on here and denounce the KKK.
[03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:06.023]  I shouldn't have to come on here and denounce Nazis.
[03:28:06.023 --> 03:28:07.224]  Duh!
[03:28:07.224 --> 03:28:08.426]  Like, duh!
[03:28:08.426 --> 03:28:12.890]  Humanity has already denounced these groups, okay?
[03:28:12.890 --> 03:28:15.073]  We already know this is the scummest of the scum.
[03:28:17.745 --> 03:28:22.627]  They keep bringing it back up and trying to make it legitimate again.
[03:28:22.627 --> 03:28:24.628]  When really all of these people are LARPing.
[03:28:24.628 --> 03:28:26.528]  There is no real KKK.
[03:28:26.528 --> 03:28:28.869]  There is no real Nazi party.
[03:28:28.869 --> 03:28:32.431]  All you have is LARPers pretending that they're doing this.
[03:28:32.431 --> 03:28:35.712]  So, there's a real civil war going on.
[03:28:35.712 --> 03:28:42.894]  Everybody knows it and so the LARPers go out in the streets that have nothing else to do and actually think that this is how they're getting involved in the civil war.
[03:28:42.894 --> 03:28:46.516]  So, most of these people are just LARPers.
[03:28:47.691 --> 03:28:56.497]  But speaking of white supremacy, where is the marches against the Clintons' white supremacy?
[03:28:56.497 --> 03:28:59.540]  Hillary and Bill Clinton are above the law.
[03:28:59.540 --> 03:29:03.363]  Chelsea Clinton gets money from the Clinton Foundation to pay for her weddings.
[03:29:03.363 --> 03:29:07.265]  Where's that white supremacy?
[03:29:07.265 --> 03:29:12.289]  You realize that Antifa is made up of probably 90% white people?
[03:29:15.851 --> 03:29:17.732]  They are also above the law.
[03:29:17.732 --> 03:29:20.413]  So you want to look for white supremacy?
[03:29:20.413 --> 03:29:31.218]  Look no further than the Clintons, and look no further than Antifa, a domestic terrorist group that gets to riot in the streets of America, burn American flags, and not even get arrested!
[03:29:31.218 --> 03:29:32.659]  There's your white supremacy!
[03:29:32.659 --> 03:29:34.680]  The Clintons and Antifa!
[03:29:34.680 --> 03:29:36.461]  So let's take them down!
[03:29:36.461 --> 03:29:37.861]  We're on the march.
[03:29:37.861 --> 03:29:40.383]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:40.383 --> 03:29:43.064]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:48.855 --> 03:29:50.256]  Why is the fungus?
[03:29:50.256 --> 03:29:51.337]  Why is the mold?
[03:29:51.337 --> 03:29:53.078]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[03:29:53.078 --> 03:29:54.039]  What is going on?
[03:29:54.039 --> 03:29:54.819]  What has changed?
[03:30:19.115 --> 03:30:20.576]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[03:30:20.576 --> 03:30:21.537]  I want to get your reviews.
[03:30:21.537 --> 03:30:22.517]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[03:30:22.517 --> 03:30:23.978]  For me, it's been incredible.
[03:30:23.978 --> 03:30:28.501]  MycoZX, antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[03:30:28.501 --> 03:30:29.321]  Get it today.
[03:30:29.321 --> 03:30:29.801]  Limited run.
[03:30:29.801 --> 03:30:31.222]  It'll be months till we get more.
[03:30:31.222 --> 03:30:35.885]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:30:35.885 --> 03:30:39.227]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[03:30:39.227 --> 03:30:41.548]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[03:30:41.548 --> 03:30:42.989]  Look at the response we're getting.
[03:30:42.989 --> 03:30:44.910]  We're changing the world together.
[03:30:44.910 --> 03:30:45.930]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:30:45.930 --> 03:30:46.671]  God bless you all.
[03:30:48.467 --> 03:30:50.349]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:30:50.349 --> 03:30:52.392]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:30:52.392 --> 03:30:55.296]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:30:55.296 --> 03:31:01.363]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:01.363 --> 03:31:07.571]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems.
[03:31:07.851 --> 03:31:10.532]  ...have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:31:10.532 --> 03:31:18.074]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:18.074 --> 03:31:26.097]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:26.097 --> 03:31:27.057]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:28.272 --> 03:31:32.216]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:32.216 --> 03:31:35.800]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:35.800 --> 03:31:42.507]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:42.507 --> 03:31:46.692]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:50.191 --> 03:31:53.954]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:31:53.954 --> 03:32:01.699]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:01.699 --> 03:32:10.305]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:10.305 --> 03:32:14.727]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:32:14.727 --> 03:32:19.891]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[03:32:20.311 --> 03:32:24.552]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:32:24.552 --> 03:32:27.972]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:32:27.972 --> 03:32:39.094]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:32:39.094 --> 03:32:41.995]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:32:41.995 --> 03:32:47.976]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:32:55.100 --> 03:32:56.280]  You found it.
[03:32:56.280 --> 03:32:58.321]  The tip of the spear.
[03:32:58.321 --> 03:33:06.143]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[03:33:06.143 --> 03:33:11.285]  You know what happens when you ingest fluoride your entire life?
[03:33:11.285 --> 03:33:14.846]  You become a professional LARPer.
[03:33:14.846 --> 03:33:17.787]  On the streets of America.
[03:33:17.787 --> 03:33:21.988]  It's honestly just... It really does just explain everything, folks.
[03:33:21.988 --> 03:33:23.789]  These people have no lives.
[03:33:25.265 --> 03:33:30.646]  They have no way to express their energies and their emotions.
[03:33:30.646 --> 03:33:32.207]  They've probably never had a lover.
[03:33:32.207 --> 03:33:35.388]  It's really just sad.
[03:33:35.388 --> 03:33:36.948]  It's really just sad.
[03:33:36.948 --> 03:33:48.931]  But you know, it's amazing how these things work themselves out, because call it God, call it providence, call it karma, call it the universe, whatever you want to call it.
[03:33:48.931 --> 03:33:52.072]  It really is amazing how all these things work themselves out.
[03:33:53.362 --> 03:33:59.628]  First of all, this weekend, when all this is going on, is George Soros' birthday.
[03:33:59.628 --> 03:34:06.635]  So a nice little juicy birthday present for George Soros, a white nationalist march, with torches.
[03:34:06.635 --> 03:34:18.346]  Oh, oh, oh, and by the way, I'm just, did anyone, does anyone else notice, folks, if you don't think this entire weekend was a setup, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just sorry.
[03:34:19.761 --> 03:34:22.804]  Who was Richard Spencer coordinating with?
[03:34:22.804 --> 03:34:28.610]  Because CNN had all of their, all of the liberal media had their cameras ready to go for this thing.
[03:34:28.610 --> 03:34:29.631]  Did you notice that?
[03:34:29.631 --> 03:34:35.236]  Did you notice how they had the sky shots, they had all the angles, they knew where they were marching?
[03:34:35.236 --> 03:34:37.379]  Folks, this was a coordinated event!
[03:34:37.379 --> 03:34:41.603]  And you think it's just a coincidence the very next day is the Unite the Right rally?
[03:34:45.239 --> 03:34:56.103]  And I'm sure, and I'm sure that the, is that video, is that above footage video?
[03:34:56.103 --> 03:34:57.344]  So this is actually amazing.
[03:34:57.344 --> 03:34:58.084]  This is another thing.
[03:34:58.084 --> 03:35:04.367]  I mean, I need like 50 hours in a day just to try to dissect all this, folks.
[03:35:04.367 --> 03:35:08.388]  I have people sending me videos saying that they saw, I'm not even gonna get into it.
[03:35:08.388 --> 03:35:10.129]  I'm not even gonna get into it, okay?
[03:35:10.129 --> 03:35:11.390]  The whole thing was a setup.
[03:35:12.276 --> 03:35:27.640]  It's clearly obvious, and if you don't think for one second that the big news here that no one is talking about is the two dead police officers from the downed helicopter, why is this not being talked about?
[03:35:27.640 --> 03:35:29.741]  Why is this not the biggest story?
[03:35:29.741 --> 03:35:33.162]  How in the hell did a police helicopter crash?
[03:35:35.526 --> 03:35:36.908]  I'm sure that's just a coincidence.
[03:35:36.908 --> 03:35:39.271]  Just like George Soros' birthday is a coincidence.
[03:35:39.271 --> 03:35:41.314]  Do you remember Aaron Black?
[03:35:41.314 --> 03:35:44.397]  You may remember the name Aaron Black, folks.
[03:35:44.397 --> 03:35:50.165]  DNC operative admitted how it was him that shut down the Trump rally in Chicago.
[03:35:50.165 --> 03:35:52.208]  Admitted it was him that started that violence.
[03:35:54.059 --> 03:35:54.860]  Bob Kramer.
[03:35:54.860 --> 03:35:55.521]  Remember him?
[03:35:55.521 --> 03:35:58.264]  Remember Hillary's Donald Duck?
[03:35:58.264 --> 03:36:00.667]  You remember those Project Veritas videos?
[03:36:00.667 --> 03:36:05.474]  If you don't think that's the exact same thing that happened this weekend in Charlottesville, you're not paying attention.
[03:36:07.213 --> 03:36:08.594]  Alex, what do you say?
[03:36:08.594 --> 03:36:21.464]  Well, I was just about to say, I'm in there watching you while we get stuff ready for the nightly news and things and other programs we're doing, and listening to you, you're absolutely on target, that we forget all the admitted stuff they've been caught doing.
[03:36:21.464 --> 03:36:29.750]  We have to compile all the false flags, all the fake stuff, all the WikiLeaks, the Jewish guy attacking the Jewish centers, man, how Trump was right.
[03:36:30.330 --> 03:36:34.113]  And just all of that to just show people the history of this.
[03:36:34.113 --> 03:36:39.877]  This is what Soros has been setting up, then it's on his birthday, and then the helicopter goes down, and all this weirdness.
[03:36:39.877 --> 03:36:41.778]  This thing is as phony as a $3 bill.
[03:36:41.778 --> 03:36:54.406]  And then you have the exact same type of protest in Ukraine with the torches, funded by Soros, happen in America, and Leanne McAdoo is actually going to be interviewing Lee Stranahan about this later.
[03:36:56.302 --> 03:36:57.983]  Yeah, so it's the same Soros groups.
[03:36:57.983 --> 03:36:59.804]  He's a Nazi collaborator.
[03:36:59.804 --> 03:37:03.826]  So wait, Alex, hold on a second.
[03:37:03.826 --> 03:37:10.208]  It's not like, it's not like Steve Scalise got shot by James Hodgkinson, a radical left-wing terrorist.
[03:37:10.208 --> 03:37:11.649]  It's not like what was the guy's name?
[03:37:11.649 --> 03:37:16.631]  Clayton Carter, I think, in Pennsylvania that shot his neighbor who had anti-Trump signs in his yard.
[03:37:16.631 --> 03:37:18.992]  The mainstream media didn't cover that at all.
[03:37:18.992 --> 03:37:20.693]  Didn't even mention that.
[03:37:20.693 --> 03:37:21.594]  Did you notice that?
[03:37:21.594 --> 03:37:23.534]  Shot and killed him in front of his wife.
[03:37:23.534 --> 03:37:24.375]  Two bullets to the head.
[03:37:25.552 --> 03:37:26.834]  You never hear about that!
[03:37:26.834 --> 03:37:30.037]  But you'll hear about this poor lady forever!
[03:37:30.037 --> 03:37:31.258]  But listen, listen!
[03:37:46.275 --> 03:37:47.856]  We've done a hiatus on the Nightly News.
[03:37:47.856 --> 03:37:49.357]  When I said Nightly News, I meant like... We're coming back.
[03:37:49.357 --> 03:37:51.579]  That's what I need the Nightly News crew to do now.
[03:37:51.579 --> 03:37:53.460]  Not just gearing up for next week's shows.
[03:37:53.460 --> 03:37:55.421]  Everybody needs to compilate all the false flags.
[03:37:55.421 --> 03:37:56.442]  You know them all.
[03:37:56.442 --> 03:38:00.005]  Put them into a video and say, you know, proof that they staged these events.
[03:38:00.005 --> 03:38:01.546]  And shove that down their dirty throats.
[03:38:01.546 --> 03:38:03.827]  Because that's why they want us off YouTube and Facebook.
[03:38:03.827 --> 03:38:06.029]  Because we show what they are!
[03:38:06.029 --> 03:38:06.389]  That's right.
[03:38:06.389 --> 03:38:07.830]  That's why you need to share these links.
[03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:09.131]  Tell your friends and family.
[03:38:09.131 --> 03:38:12.033]  We're getting to this point now that Soros is a Nazi and has the same torch.
[03:38:12.033 --> 03:38:13.534]  And then the guy leading it.
[03:38:14.929 --> 03:38:16.790]  He's a Democrat, Obama supporter.
[03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:17.330]  Yeah.
[03:38:17.330 --> 03:38:18.051]  Kessler?
[03:38:18.051 --> 03:38:18.651]  Yeah, uh-huh.
[03:38:18.651 --> 03:38:22.033]  Who's in with the Occupy Wall Street?
[03:38:22.033 --> 03:38:24.214]  How obvious does it have to get?
[03:38:24.214 --> 03:38:25.075]  It's just too obvious.
[03:38:25.075 --> 03:38:31.479]  And honestly, my thing with Kessler is I think he's more a useful idiot, if anything, my analysis would be right now.
[03:38:31.479 --> 03:38:33.760]  I don't know if he is a true operative.
[03:38:33.760 --> 03:38:36.121]  I think that there are clearly operatives at play here, though.
[03:38:36.121 --> 03:38:37.162]  I think that that's undoubted.
[03:38:37.162 --> 03:38:38.483]  Oh, you think so?
[03:38:38.483 --> 03:38:38.823]  Yeah.
[03:38:38.823 --> 03:38:43.866]  I mean, well, it's not like we have the WikiLeaks or the Project Veritas videos admitting any of this, though.
[03:38:45.134 --> 03:38:50.879]  And by the way, here in racist America, it's funny how quickly we forget that it wasn't even a year ago.
[03:38:50.879 --> 03:38:55.563]  America has a conscience, so they beat us over the head with this race crap all day!
[03:38:55.563 --> 03:38:58.806]  You can't go to China if you're not rich and not Chinese!
[03:38:58.806 --> 03:39:01.288]  You can't go to these Muslim countries if you're not a Muslim!
[03:39:01.288 --> 03:39:02.449]  We're the open country!
[03:39:02.449 --> 03:39:07.714]  And I'm sick of the damn lies of the parasitic, filthy Soros, so-called left!
[03:39:07.714 --> 03:39:10.336]  They're a bunch of fascist real Nazis!
[03:39:10.336 --> 03:39:12.217]  Well, it's not like we've ever had a black president.
[03:39:12.217 --> 03:39:12.318]  Oh!
[03:39:13.368 --> 03:39:15.689]  Oh yeah, it's funny how we just cast Obama aside.
[03:39:15.689 --> 03:39:16.950]  Like, Obama never happened!
[03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:18.411]  America never had a black president!
[03:39:18.411 --> 03:39:20.192]  There's a record number of whites who put him in there!
[03:39:20.192 --> 03:39:23.153]  I'm sick of this crap!
[03:39:23.153 --> 03:39:25.994]  Tell us how you really feel, Alex.
[03:39:25.994 --> 03:39:27.055]  Let's go to the phone calls.
[03:39:27.055 --> 03:39:28.656]  We've got people wanting to call in about this.
[03:39:28.656 --> 03:39:32.338]  Let's start with Cassie in Arkansas, calling in on Charlottesville.
[03:39:32.338 --> 03:39:34.259]  Go ahead, Cassie.
[03:39:34.259 --> 03:39:35.059]  Hello?
[03:39:35.059 --> 03:39:36.680]  I just want to let you know... Am I on?
[03:39:38.959 --> 03:39:44.863]  Okay, I just want to let you know that I was born in Charlottesville, and I just want to tell you why every time I go there, I get nauseous.
[03:39:44.863 --> 03:39:47.825]  Because it's just not run properly, and it's dangerous.
[03:39:47.825 --> 03:39:49.667]  It's not that it's a rough area.
[03:39:49.667 --> 03:39:51.328]  It's a very nice little town.
[03:39:51.328 --> 03:39:52.909]  You have Monticello and stuff.
[03:39:52.909 --> 03:40:03.016]  But you just have the authorities and the local leaders and the governor of Virginia, they just do not care.
[03:40:03.016 --> 03:40:07.980]  Did you know that the governor called in the National Guard and had them stand down, and the police?
[03:40:10.046 --> 03:40:18.229]  So are you saying that it's political leadership, or law enforcement leadership, or a combination of the two?
[03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:21.910]  It's both, and it just makes the city not safe.
[03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:28.732]  It is not, and I've lived in rough areas, but, and it's not that Charlesville is a rough area, it's just that the leadership makes it not safe.
[03:40:28.732 --> 03:40:36.915]  Well I gotta tell you, it's the same thing, and you know, it's tough not to get twisted in the middle of this thing, in the middle of this cyclone.
[03:40:38.194 --> 03:40:40.636]  And not wind up on someone's side.
[03:40:40.636 --> 03:40:42.977]  But I saw the same thing when I was covering Ferguson and St.
[03:40:42.977 --> 03:40:43.557]  Louis.
[03:40:43.557 --> 03:40:46.880]  The police tactics used were miserable.
[03:40:46.880 --> 03:40:49.461]  The police tactics used only escalated things.
[03:40:49.461 --> 03:40:51.202]  And again, the police are not my enemy.
[03:40:51.202 --> 03:40:53.144]  I'm not trying to be upset with the police.
[03:40:53.144 --> 03:40:54.825]  99% of those guys are just taking orders.
[03:40:55.976 --> 03:41:11.728]  But there is definitely something to be said about the way these things are handled, whether it be because they're trying to be politically correct, or whether it be that they really want to see some violence, whatever the case is, they're not handling these things right, and it seems to me there's no learning curve.
[03:41:11.728 --> 03:41:15.911]  It doesn't matter how many times we have to see this happen, it doesn't matter if it's Charlotte,
[03:41:16.775 --> 03:41:21.880]  It doesn't matter if it's Maryland, it doesn't matter if it's Ferguson, it doesn't matter if it's Charlottesville.
[03:41:21.880 --> 03:41:24.682]  All these places, we never learn.
[03:41:24.682 --> 03:41:27.685]  The tactics never change.
[03:41:27.685 --> 03:41:30.748]  And somehow, somehow Antifa just still gets to operate.
[03:41:30.748 --> 03:41:31.869]  I don't know.
[03:41:31.869 --> 03:41:33.330]  Go ahead, Cassie.
[03:41:33.330 --> 03:41:39.736]  Yesterday, they broke off areas so they wouldn't, the police said, they wouldn't let Antifa get near the right-wingers.
[03:41:40.447 --> 03:41:43.029]  So, you know, why didn't that happen in Charlottesville?
[03:41:43.029 --> 03:41:45.350]  Why am I even having, but this is what I'm saying.
[03:41:45.350 --> 03:41:51.494]  If you look, if you look at the images from Seattle, it was either Portland or Seattle, probably both places.
[03:41:51.494 --> 03:41:52.495]  It happens all the time.
[03:41:52.495 --> 03:41:57.058]  You have a line of police and then you have protesters.
[03:41:57.058 --> 03:41:58.739]  These people aren't, they're LARPers.
[03:41:58.739 --> 03:41:59.499]  They're LARPers.
[03:41:59.499 --> 03:42:07.985]  You have LARPers that are out there spraying like confetti or silly string at police officers, spitting at them, throwing objects at them.
[03:42:10.891 --> 03:42:13.593]  I mean, again, I'm not for police violence.
[03:42:13.593 --> 03:42:15.395]  I don't want a police state.
[03:42:15.395 --> 03:42:24.122]  You don't think I grew up just like everyone else that hated police, didn't like being harassed by police for this, that, or the other thing?
[03:42:24.122 --> 03:42:26.584]  We all have that same instinct.
[03:42:26.584 --> 03:42:29.166]  But the police are not the enemy.
[03:42:29.166 --> 03:42:30.407]  And I don't understand
[03:42:31.604 --> 03:42:42.714]  How the police aren't looked at as some of the most tolerant people in America, when they're literally getting spat on, having things thrown at them, Silly String sprayed in their face, by LARPers?
[03:42:42.714 --> 03:42:46.638]  How are they not deemed the most tolerant people?
[03:42:46.638 --> 03:42:56.967]  What I would do if I was those police officers, that I got sprayed with Silly String, I would literally take my uniform off and put it down and say, spray me now, you little punk ass, you know what?
[03:42:58.097 --> 03:42:59.099]  Thank you for the call, Cassie.
[03:42:59.099 --> 03:43:01.525]  Let's go to Stephen in Florida.
[03:43:01.525 --> 03:43:04.472]  Go ahead, Stephen.
[03:43:04.472 --> 03:43:05.634]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon.
[03:43:05.634 --> 03:43:07.539]  Hey, I want to say first of all to...
[03:43:09.885 --> 03:43:20.372]  All the wonderful media people out there like John Oliver and the others who have tried to defame Alex for all the products you guys carry.
[03:43:20.372 --> 03:43:22.333]  I don't care what you people say.
[03:43:22.333 --> 03:43:33.561]  I use them, they work, and I'm going to continue to and I'm going to continue to tell my friends about the products through InfoWars Life because they're second to none.
[03:43:33.561 --> 03:43:38.244]  So thank you Alex and Dr. Group and all the others out there who promote those.
[03:43:38.884 --> 03:44:03.039]  You know, speaking of that, as we're giving much needed appreciation to the media out there like John Oliver and MSNBC and CNN and Van Jones, as we're giving them the appreciation that they deserve, I find it so ironic, I find it more ironic than anything else in the history of my life,
[03:44:04.448 --> 03:44:23.447]  That you have the Women's March and liberal media out here blaming the right for the death of Heather Heyer, the woman who died because of the car attacker, the nut job, and they don't even see how it's their fault!
[03:44:24.500 --> 03:44:25.480]  They don't even get it.
[03:44:25.480 --> 03:44:29.121]  They blame everyone else except themselves.
[03:44:29.121 --> 03:44:31.682]  They're out here telling you Trump is racist.
[03:44:31.682 --> 03:44:35.263]  They're out here telling you that Trumpcare is going to kill your grandma.
[03:44:35.263 --> 03:44:38.164]  They're out here telling you that Trump is a Russian.
[03:44:38.164 --> 03:44:44.586]  They're out here telling you a bunch of racist bigots, white supremacists elected Trump, a bunch of Russian bots.
[03:44:44.586 --> 03:44:47.626]  They're telling you all these lies about Hillary.
[03:44:47.626 --> 03:44:51.668]  So literally, lying, all day long, propaganda, 100%.
[03:44:54.318 --> 03:44:57.739]  And poor Heather buys it.
[03:44:57.739 --> 03:45:04.300]  Poor little Heather and her fluoridated mind falls for the fake news.
[03:45:04.300 --> 03:45:08.701]  And she goes out on the streets and she actually thinks she's protesting racism.
[03:45:08.701 --> 03:45:11.601]  She actually thinks she's protesting the Russian president.
[03:45:11.601 --> 03:45:15.542]  She actually thinks she's protesting something substantial.
[03:45:15.542 --> 03:45:16.742]  A struggle!
[03:45:16.742 --> 03:45:18.522]  That's what they said.
[03:45:18.522 --> 03:45:22.163]  They said, we will continue the struggle that Heather died for.
[03:45:23.902 --> 03:45:28.984]  The struggle that Heather died for was a struggle between fake news and reality.
[03:45:28.984 --> 03:45:38.668]  And I feel sad that Heather fell for fake news and went out there and protested and ended up dead because of the very fake news that the fake media perpetuated.
[03:45:38.668 --> 03:45:48.911]  So all the fake media out there, including the Women's March on Twitter, pointing your finger at Trump supporters, pointing your finger at right-wingers, saying it's their fault that Heather died.
[03:45:48.911 --> 03:45:52.773]  You need to look in the mirror and ask yourself, why was she out there to begin with?
[03:45:53.493 --> 03:45:54.714]  Why was she marching?
[03:45:54.714 --> 03:45:59.057]  Because you told her to.
[03:45:59.057 --> 03:46:00.157]  Based on lies.
[03:46:00.157 --> 03:46:02.779]  Did you have something else, Stephen?
[03:46:02.779 --> 03:46:14.066]  Yeah, you know, I hate to say this, and this is going to sound insensitive, but thinking about what you were just saying about Heather, I really believe that this poor woman
[03:46:15.214 --> 03:46:22.544]  She's become a victim of basically her own foolishness, but she's the poster child for what I see coming in America.
[03:46:22.544 --> 03:46:30.574]  You know, the controllers, they want to refer to people like her and Antifa, BLM, etc.
[03:46:30.574 --> 03:46:31.896]  as useful idiots.
[03:46:32.395 --> 03:46:42.026]  What these people don't realize is they're going to downgrade them when they're done with their usefulness to useless feeders and then turn them into soylent green.
[03:46:42.026 --> 03:46:43.508]  Well, that's the next level down the road.
[03:46:43.508 --> 03:46:47.052]  That's the next level down the road, but your prior point to that is absolutely spot on.
[03:46:47.532 --> 03:46:48.832]  We've seen this coming.
[03:46:48.832 --> 03:46:51.593]  Alex Jones has been saying this for years.
[03:46:51.593 --> 03:46:55.495]  They're going to set up the quote-unquote right wing.
[03:46:55.495 --> 03:46:57.676]  They're going to set up the conspiracy theorists.
[03:46:57.676 --> 03:46:59.416]  They're going to set up the patriots.
[03:46:59.416 --> 03:47:04.898]  They're going to set up the whole thing and blame it on them, even though it was their propaganda that started it the entire time.
[03:47:04.898 --> 03:47:06.519]  We've been telling you that for years.
[03:47:06.519 --> 03:47:07.719]  Thank you for the call, Stephen.
[03:47:07.719 --> 03:47:10.360]  Let's go to Pete, who's also in Florida.
[03:47:10.360 --> 03:47:11.240]  Go ahead, Pete.
[03:47:11.240 --> 03:47:12.501]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:47:13.591 --> 03:47:19.876]  I was going to comment specifically on the police and their conduct.
[03:47:19.876 --> 03:47:38.630]  Years ago, I actually was a Nazi and in Chicago, and I'm here to tell you, when we had rallies in Market Park or Daily Center Plaza, the Chicago police would have a line three officers deep in between us and the protesters.
[03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:40.872]  And in fact, protesters would have to heave stuff
[03:47:41.787 --> 03:47:44.688]  Over the police line to get to us.
[03:47:44.688 --> 03:47:55.713]  And if anyone on either side did or said anything to the police that was inappropriate, let me tell you something, the Chicago police took action immediately.
[03:47:55.713 --> 03:47:56.293]  Immediately.
[03:47:57.472 --> 03:48:06.280]  Well, we know about the new political correct nature of police, but so you're saying that you obviously weren't an actual Nazi.
[03:48:06.280 --> 03:48:12.925]  You're saying you were a LARPing Nazi and you guys had marches or something and the police protected you from getting assaulted?
[03:48:12.925 --> 03:48:15.748]  I'm sorry, I'm not fully understanding this.
[03:48:15.748 --> 03:48:19.231]  Well, take the rally at Daly Center Plaza.
[03:48:19.231 --> 03:48:22.493]  We were out there in uniform and most of us in the front line.
[03:48:22.493 --> 03:48:23.094]  In Nazi uniform?
[03:48:23.993 --> 03:48:30.062]  Yeah, I had to carry shields and wear a helmet because stuff would come flying over the line at us.
[03:48:30.062 --> 03:48:31.845]  No, I'm not a Nazi anymore.
[03:48:31.845 --> 03:48:34.088]  Let's be clear about that.
[03:48:34.088 --> 03:48:37.053]  I was back then, but not anymore.
[03:48:37.053 --> 03:48:38.995]  Well, you never were, you were a LARPing.
[03:48:38.995 --> 03:48:39.817]  Just like they are now.
[03:48:42.801 --> 03:48:43.441]  Thank you for the call.
[03:48:43.441 --> 03:48:44.242]  I understand your point.
[03:48:44.242 --> 03:48:46.022]  I got other callers to get to.
[03:48:46.022 --> 03:48:51.364]  But the point is that the police don't, they don't take common sense tactics like they used to, folks.
[03:48:51.364 --> 03:48:53.725]  That's the true point there.
[03:48:53.725 --> 03:48:56.226]  Let's now go to William in Massachusetts.
[03:48:56.226 --> 03:48:56.787]  Go ahead, William.
[03:48:56.787 --> 03:48:59.007]  Hi.
[03:48:59.007 --> 03:49:00.268]  Hi.
[03:49:00.268 --> 03:49:00.708]  Hi.
[03:49:00.708 --> 03:49:09.131]  I was just calling because actually in Massachusetts we got another rally going on here, Freedom of Speech Rally.
[03:49:09.131 --> 03:49:10.932]  I think Joe Biggs is going to be there.
[03:49:12.757 --> 03:49:17.122]  Apparently there's like a lot of people getting together.
[03:49:17.122 --> 03:49:18.363]  See, but you notice that.
[03:49:18.363 --> 03:49:19.725]  A free speech rally.
[03:49:19.725 --> 03:49:20.806]  That's inclusive.
[03:49:20.806 --> 03:49:22.148]  A free speech rally.
[03:49:22.148 --> 03:49:23.109]  That's inclusive.
[03:49:23.109 --> 03:49:25.351]  That doesn't play identity politics.
[03:49:25.351 --> 03:49:26.453]  A march on Google.
[03:49:26.453 --> 03:49:27.354]  That's inclusive.
[03:49:27.354 --> 03:49:29.016]  There's no identity politics there.
[03:49:29.016 --> 03:49:29.376]  Hmm.
[03:49:29.376 --> 03:49:29.797]  Wow.
[03:49:29.797 --> 03:49:30.698]  I wonder what the difference is.
[03:49:32.935 --> 03:49:34.155]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:49:34.155 --> 03:49:38.576]  They're already labeling it as like a white nationalist get-together, the mayor of Boston.
[03:49:38.576 --> 03:49:41.077]  Yeah, and that's the point that Milley was making earlier.
[03:49:41.077 --> 03:49:48.718]  You just really... You try to have any political march like that, that's how they're going to bastardize it.
[03:49:48.718 --> 03:49:53.259]  Even a free speech rally, they're going to bastardize it.
[03:49:53.259 --> 03:49:54.760]  I know, and they're shutting down.
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:49:58.640]  I mean, it's pretty much... I feel like there's just a big operation here.
[03:49:58.640 --> 03:50:00.921]  They're using the shutdown free speech altogether.
[03:50:03.166 --> 03:50:04.147]  Well, that's their goal.
[03:50:04.147 --> 03:50:08.630]  It's, you know, free speech is one of our rights here, so they gotta take that away from us.
[03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:10.491]  Thank you for the call.
[03:50:10.491 --> 03:50:18.696]  We'll take a couple more calls on their side, but he brought up future protests, so I will bring this up to you.
[03:50:18.696 --> 03:50:26.061]  Apparently, there's already another rally being planned in Virginia in September.
[03:50:26.061 --> 03:50:30.904]  Rally at the Robert E. Lee Monument in Richmond in September, folks.
[03:50:30.904 --> 03:50:31.825]  They're not gonna stop.
[03:50:33.379 --> 03:50:39.822]  Hey, I don't want all these Confederate monuments removed, but at the same time, I don't want a civil war over them either!
[03:50:39.822 --> 03:50:41.323]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:41.323 --> 03:50:42.644]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.

[03:54:08.107 --> 03:54:17.552]  So the New York Times tells you that Trump hasn't disavowed racism, even though he tweeted it three times before they published that story.
[03:54:17.552 --> 03:54:19.814]  Okay, I guess that makes sense.
[03:54:19.814 --> 03:54:24.497]  And then you have media, liberal media, also telling you that if you are
[03:54:25.720 --> 03:54:32.644]  Protesting Trump now that your life is in danger, even though multiple people have been shot by Trump haters.
[03:54:32.644 --> 03:54:34.105]  Okay, that makes sense too.
[03:54:34.105 --> 03:54:38.867]  No, what actually makes sense is the specials going on at Infowarsstore.com right now.

[03:55:43.899 --> 03:55:50.183]  We'll have time for one more call, but I want to bring this story up from the Hill.
[03:55:50.183 --> 03:55:54.065]  Lydia Wheeler, Trump quietly putting his stamp on the courts.
[03:55:54.065 --> 03:56:00.829]  President Trump has been quietly making lifetime appointments to fill more than 100 vacancies on federal courts across the country.
[03:56:00.829 --> 03:56:08.734]  Five judges confirmed, including Neil Gorsuch, another 30 pending, and 123 seats left for Trump to fill, folks.
[03:56:08.734 --> 03:56:09.535]  This is so key.
[03:56:11.579 --> 03:56:21.247]  Oh yeah, you didn't think that Scalia just happened to die and then they drained his body of fluids and didn't do a proper examination on that.
[03:56:21.247 --> 03:56:27.232]  You don't think they were trying to swing the Supreme Court with the assumed victory of Hillary Clinton and the appointment.
[03:56:27.232 --> 03:56:28.072]  No, no, no.
[03:56:28.072 --> 03:56:29.514]  I'm sure that that wasn't what's going on.
[03:56:29.514 --> 03:56:37.280]  But this is a legacy of Trump's that will last far after his presidency that will be triggering liberals for years to come.
[03:56:37.280 --> 03:56:40.182]  Let's go to Ron in Connecticut.
[03:56:40.182 --> 03:56:40.863]  Go ahead, Ron.
[03:56:42.816 --> 03:56:44.478]  How you doing, Owen?
[03:56:44.478 --> 03:56:49.063]  Quick comment on the statues taken down, or the monuments.
[03:56:49.063 --> 03:56:57.372]  If they're going to start taking monuments down, why don't they take Elver Pikes down in Washington, D.C., or the Mason Building headquarters that was created by a Confederate general.
[03:56:57.372 --> 03:56:58.573]  Yeah, no, it's actually funny.
[03:56:58.573 --> 03:57:04.199]  One of our savant-level cameramen here, Harrison, had the idea.
[03:57:05.060 --> 03:57:22.786]  And I won't spoil the idea completely, but basically we'll go somewhere and we'll say, oh, you are saying to take down the Confederate statues because they support slavery, and so then one case you can twist it and be like, okay, we also want to have mosques removed from the United States because Mohammed owned slaves.
[03:57:22.786 --> 03:57:25.287]  Will you sign that petition?
[03:57:25.287 --> 03:57:29.248]  Well, it's elite worship, Albert Pike.
[03:57:29.943 --> 03:57:30.823]  You know, and it's Illuminati.
[03:57:30.823 --> 03:57:32.944]  I mean, why don't we take down the Georgia guy?
[03:57:32.944 --> 03:57:33.844]  See, this is my problem.
[03:57:33.844 --> 03:57:34.764]  This is my problem, Ron.
[03:57:34.764 --> 03:57:35.485]  This is my problem.
[03:57:35.485 --> 03:57:36.325]  I'm sorry.
[03:57:36.325 --> 03:57:39.286]  I'm just so sick of these stupid distractions.
[03:57:39.286 --> 03:57:40.766]  That's all this is.
[03:57:40.766 --> 03:57:41.866]  That's all this is.
[03:57:41.866 --> 03:57:44.947]  The racism, the statues, the Confederacy, the this.
[03:57:44.947 --> 03:57:46.588]  It's all distractions.
[03:57:46.588 --> 03:57:52.949]  It's all distractions from the civil war going on in the deep state right now, the civil war going on in the White House.
[03:57:52.949 --> 03:57:58.731]  And then you have, and now you have, folks, Hillary Clinton, this woman is such a traitor.
[03:57:59.711 --> 03:58:08.497]  He had a wide open private server that Guccifer has now come out and said got hacked multiple times.
[03:58:08.497 --> 03:58:16.262]  And then you have the NSA come out and now experts from the NSA have said, yeah, the DNC email hack wasn't a hack.
[03:58:16.262 --> 03:58:18.263]  It was a leak.
[03:58:18.263 --> 03:58:20.124]  Oh my gosh.
[03:58:20.124 --> 03:58:21.325]  The world's crazy, folks.
[03:58:21.325 --> 03:58:25.388]  Just pray to God and try to stay sane and you stay classy, InfoWarriors.
