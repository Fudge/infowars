[00:00:01.826 --> 00:00:13.194]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:21.360]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.682]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:54.946]  Well, I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, it's either America's brightest hour or we're going into this republic's darkest hour.
[00:00:54.946 --> 00:01:02.688]  Thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide global transmission, already Wednesday, July 26, 2017.
[00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:09.189]  You know why they hate me?
[00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.530]  You know why they now have an entire new Comedy Central show?
[00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:26.385]  With Deadline Hollywood and Variety having the headline New Comedy Central Show to air nightly to be based on Alex Jones with their comedian quote playing the part of Alex Jones.
[00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:34.253]  And they will say things and do things every night that I haven't said or I haven't done to create branding with the type of
[00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:40.344]  Mentally retarded people that believe and watch their channel.
[00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:43.226]  And again, I'm not making fun of real people that are mentally retarded.
[00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:48.029]  I'm talking about people that have been induced into these comas.
[00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:55.514]  They will then simultaneously have news headlines saying that I'm delusional when I criticize it and they'll say it's not based on me.
[00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:59.797]  Just like Homeland and all the other programs or Tuck Buckford.
[00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:02.604]  Now why are they doing this?
[00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:06.826]  Because they're scared of the very specifics I'm breaking down.
[00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:25.094]  The reason I point that out is, is people need to understand, we have their plan, we know their plan, and they just want you to never look at the plan, so that they can basically have air superiority politically.
[00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:27.795]  And that's why you notice, you see the former CIA director,
[00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:35.225]  That told President Trump, two days before he was inaugurated, to watch his mouth.
[00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:36.885]  To watch his mouth.
[00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:39.986]  He's telling the American people and the voters to watch their mouths.
[00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:57.772]  This same globalist operative, you cannot make this up, who lived for 12 years in Saudi Arabia, and who worked with the former FBI director to take radical Islam off the FBI's training list, where they couldn't even use the term radical Islam, this creature,
[00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:02.112]  Has come out and called for a coup.
[00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:06.073]  Now that's him saying a coup.
[00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:08.393]  That's a military overthrow.
[00:03:08.393 --> 00:03:11.894]  Because he knows that the American people are awake.
[00:03:11.894 --> 00:03:15.295]  He knows the Republicans are going to win the House next year.
[00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:16.235]  Again.
[00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:17.656]  All the demographics show it.
[00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:18.656]  All the numbers.
[00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:19.496]  All the actuaries.
[00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:20.136]  All the bots.
[00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:21.657]  All the AI.
[00:03:21.657 --> 00:03:23.017]  It shows a total realignment.
[00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:26.082]  I don't
[00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:53.683]  Mangy hyenas biting him at every level, and we're sitting here like spectators, bitching, that, oh, where's my tax cut?
[00:03:53.683 --> 00:03:55.444]  Where's my Obamacare repeal?
[00:03:55.444 --> 00:04:00.245]  When he's already killed everything else he could with executive order and executive action and courage.
[00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:02.486]  And has them openly saying, kill him everywhere.
[00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:04.967]  Oh, and of course, get me.
[00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:05.987]  Destroy me.
[00:04:05.987 --> 00:04:06.867]  Kill me.
[00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:08.728]  Put me in prison.
[00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:09.828]  And go after everybody else.
[00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:12.249]  You notice a lot of other folks are getting intimidated right now.
[00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:14.450]  They're kind of pulling back, not being as hardcore.
[00:04:15.336 --> 00:04:16.717]  People are hedging their bets.
[00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:18.998]  You don't hedge your bets with this.
[00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:20.679]  You hedge your bets, we lose everything.
[00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:25.962]  I've been hammering that they're planning a coup since the day he was elected.
[00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:29.685]  And I laid out exactly what they do because I know how the system works.
[00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:31.386]  I know how they would do it.
[00:04:31.386 --> 00:04:35.288]  I know how they've done it in other countries and what they've set up here.
[00:04:35.288 --> 00:04:36.889]  So it's not, see, I told you so.
[00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.210]  It's, we're the opposite of fake news.
[00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.933]  We're super hardcore, on target,
[00:04:44.286 --> 00:04:48.549]  News and information, and that's why they're so scared.
[00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:52.393]  There's an old saying, he's got your number, or they've got your number.
[00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:54.875]  We've got their number.
[00:04:54.875 --> 00:05:05.903]  It happens when somebody's number means you've got their address, you know their shoe size, you know how tall they are, you know what they eat and their cornflakes, you know how big their ding ding is, you know who their mommy was with.
[00:05:05.903 --> 00:05:06.404]  We've got their number.
[00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:23.844]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[00:05:23.844 --> 00:05:28.147]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:30.689]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:32.850]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:39.555]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:44.758]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[00:05:44.758 --> 00:05:49.081]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:51.542]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:56.546]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[00:05:56.546 --> 00:05:57.886]  Join the InfoWars.
[00:05:57.886 --> 00:05:59.187]  Spread the information.
[00:05:59.187 --> 00:06:01.109]  Educate yourself and others.
[00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:02.910]  The truth shall set you free.
[00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.771]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.471]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:26.418]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:32.982]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:06:32.982 --> 00:06:35.443]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:35.783]  I think?
[00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:56.675]  Support.
[00:06:56.675 --> 00:06:59.557]  Caveman is finally back at the Infowars store.
[00:06:59.557 --> 00:07:06.061]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:07:08.956 --> 00:07:11.980]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.185]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:22.874]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:07:22.874 --> 00:07:26.638]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:47.407]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:07:47.407 --> 00:07:50.948]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:07:51.508 --> 00:08:02.754]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:08:02.754 --> 00:08:07.857]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:31.456]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:33.539]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:38.705]  Our big victory
[00:08:40.223 --> 00:08:48.387]  Is that we're willing to be criticized and being attacked for saying things first that are shocking and controversial.
[00:08:48.387 --> 00:08:56.391]  Like there are plans to use continuity of government systems that are in place in case the government's decapitated from a nuclear attack.
[00:08:57.523 --> 00:09:01.166]  To basically overthrow Trump and the newly elected government.
[00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:14.115]  Now we knew that that would be their attack profile, and then we began to see them start promoting it in the Financial Times of London, New Yorker Magazine, Foreign Affairs, Public Affairs, and of course Atlantic Monthly in the last four months.
[00:09:14.115 --> 00:09:25.524]  Now, we have Clapper coming out yesterday, the same guy that said Trump should watch his mouth, and then was shocked when Trump fired him, saying that there should be a coup against Trump.
[00:09:26.377 --> 00:09:39.745]  But first let's play a boil down of the last month of Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs and others saying point blank there's a clear and present danger and an ongoing plan to overthrow the president.
[00:09:41.343 --> 00:09:47.231]  And then, of course, the Washington Post came out and said, oh, Hannity is in Alex Jones territory.
[00:09:47.231 --> 00:09:47.852]  He's a kook.
[00:09:47.852 --> 00:09:48.954]  He's a loon.
[00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:53.961]  OK, you guys are in major newspapers and magazines, but they are elite publications.
[00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:56.925]  Point blank saying we've got our people in the deep state.
[00:09:56.925 --> 00:09:58.127]  It's time to overthrow Trump.
[00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:01.098]  Suddenly.
[00:10:01.098 --> 00:10:02.238]  Physically.
[00:10:02.238 --> 00:10:05.240]  We're talking serious crime they're talking about here.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.601]  And then they plan to shut down the independent media.
[00:10:07.601 --> 00:10:19.228]  They plan to go and say all the Republicans that got elected in the last Congress are going to be removed or subject to a new election that federalized, Democrat-run, homeland security overseas.
[00:10:19.228 --> 00:10:20.249]  We'll be like Venezuela.
[00:10:20.249 --> 00:10:21.770]  We'll never have a real election again.
[00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.051]  This is happening.
[00:10:24.051 --> 00:10:24.852]  I said it first.
[00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:30.342]  Because I knew we had to say it, and now you notice they're in the news saying it.
[00:10:30.342 --> 00:10:31.902]  So I wasn't wrong.
[00:10:31.902 --> 00:10:33.162]  Sean Hannity wasn't wrong.
[00:10:33.162 --> 00:10:34.643]  Lou Dobbs wasn't wrong.
[00:10:34.643 --> 00:10:36.903]  Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wasn't wrong.
[00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:40.144]  We're telling you, word for word, what they're doing.
[00:10:40.144 --> 00:10:46.365]  And again, I keep saying, I told you first, because they've got shows every day attacking me.
[00:10:46.365 --> 00:10:51.606]  They've got programs lying about us every day, because they have to destroy us politically, because we're on target.
[00:10:52.861 --> 00:11:07.330]  The good news is the more people realize I'm right and the more now Rush Limbaugh basically listens to the show or has his folks do it and goes and checks out what I say and then looks it up for himself and then goes on air and says the exact same thing, that's how I protect my family.
[00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.832]  I don't want to be the only guy out here.
[00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:12.655]  Knockin' Grand Slams every day, okay?
[00:11:12.655 --> 00:11:18.323]  I want everybody to wake up, people to understand the game, understand how the scam works, and then it's game over.
[00:11:18.323 --> 00:11:19.245]  I want to win.
[00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:21.047]  I want to be made obsolete.
[00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:21.969]  Do you understand?
[00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:25.053]  I do not want to be the cutting edge, tip of the spear.
[00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:29.276]  That's how we get killed, that's how we get shut down, and they win.
[00:11:29.276 --> 00:11:31.997]  I must be made obsolete to win.
[00:11:31.997 --> 00:11:33.678]  I want to be obsolete.
[00:11:33.678 --> 00:11:35.479]  Now, at this point, I'm not obsolete.
[00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:38.441]  I am the cutting edge, as I've been for 20 years.
[00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:39.361]  Okay?
[00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:40.962]  And I've been learning for 20 years.
[00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:42.463]  Now, we are cutting edge.
[00:11:42.463 --> 00:11:45.224]  We are very cutting edge, and that's why they hate us.
[00:11:45.224 --> 00:11:51.948]  It's why they have a whole new Comedy Central show coming out, where they say it's based on me, just like Colbert was supposed to be Bill O'Reilly.
[00:11:52.768 --> 00:11:59.311]  Okay, word for word, a show every night saying, I'm Alex Jones and I hate this, I hate that, total lies.
[00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:00.512]  I'm not even going to say what they're going to say.
[00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:01.353]  We know what they're going to say.
[00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:03.294]  They'll take that out of context.
[00:12:03.294 --> 00:12:07.036]  This is what they're doing to lie to you and lie to the American people.
[00:12:07.036 --> 00:12:12.979]  But let's play a short boil down, the last few months, of folks talking about the coup, the coup plan.
[00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:14.740]  Now, the former head of the CIA,
[00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:15.914]  The
[00:12:34.611 --> 00:12:36.172]  Went and became a Muslim.
[00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.472]  He did go to the ceremonies.
[00:12:37.472 --> 00:12:40.873]  He did become a Muslim in the mosque of the Saudi royal family.
[00:12:40.873 --> 00:12:44.814]  And folks said, oh, that's just a CIA guy doing that as, you know, as just infiltrate.
[00:12:44.814 --> 00:12:46.495]  No, he went native.
[00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:47.755]  They've got all the money.
[00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:54.817]  He is absolutely probably wipes his hand, you know, wipes his butt with his left hand, something, you know, we're all big fans of around here.
[00:12:54.817 --> 00:12:55.318]  I'm serious.
[00:12:55.318 --> 00:12:58.599]  I mean, he probably, you know, probably has a Somali bride.
[00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:00.659]  The whole point is we love our Somalis.
[00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:01.519]  We love our Muslims, too.
[00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:02.080]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.780]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.103]  And I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:10.811]  I used to hear there was this big double-cross coming 20 years ago for the Muslims, that the left was going to side with them.
[00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:11.933]  And I said, there's no way.
[00:13:11.933 --> 00:13:14.257]  They throw gays off buildings.
[00:13:14.257 --> 00:13:15.158]  They murder people.
[00:13:15.158 --> 00:13:16.560]  Women can't drive cars.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:16.900]  And then...
[00:13:18.325 --> 00:13:19.685]  The leftist media won't cover.
[00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:21.706]  I'm going to play this clip today.
[00:13:21.706 --> 00:13:28.228]  Women burning their hijabs all over Iraq, all over the Middle East, and they're linking to InfoWars stories.
[00:13:28.228 --> 00:13:30.968]  They're saying, we want feminists to stand up for us.
[00:13:30.968 --> 00:13:33.189]  We want women in America to stand up for us.
[00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:36.670]  They hear myself and Bill Maher to his credit, and many others.
[00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:54.913]  Saying, look, you can't sit there and claim you're feminist or for women and then have USA Today say, wear a hijab for solidarity with women and have Linda Sorcerer, who's into genital mutilation and, you know, never criticizes the enslavement and murder of women and gays and all the rest of it, being the leader of the feminist movement.
[00:13:54.913 --> 00:13:56.573]  This is sick mental illness.
[00:13:56.573 --> 00:14:05.655]  And there's no feminist or no liberal groups going, oh look, women are burning their burqas and their hijabs in liberated areas of Iraq and Syria.
[00:14:06.255 --> 00:14:10.498]  In areas where they never had to wear them before, they got overrun and enslaved and raped.
[00:14:10.498 --> 00:14:13.000]  No coverage of that on CNN.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.903]  By that little CIA twit, Anderson Cooper.
[00:14:16.903 --> 00:14:17.784]  Or any of these people.
[00:14:18.587 --> 00:14:19.948]  And Anderson Cooper is a perfect example.
[00:14:19.948 --> 00:14:22.290]  They'll go, Jones is crazy and says he's CIA.
[00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.452]  He's admittedly CIA.
[00:14:24.452 --> 00:14:25.353]  He was in the CIA.
[00:14:25.353 --> 00:14:26.734]  He's always been in it.
[00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:27.535]  What do you think CNN is?
[00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:31.859]  It's a bunch of leftist foundation people that have taken control of the CIA, basically.
[00:14:31.859 --> 00:14:37.164]  And they all want to be tough guys, so they all want their little CIA decoder ring or whatever.
[00:14:37.164 --> 00:14:41.027]  Most of them can't even literally tie their own shoelaces.
[00:14:41.027 --> 00:14:42.409]  They're such inbred bluebloods.
[00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:43.730]  And you've got all that happening.
[00:14:45.168 --> 00:14:48.391]  And they go, oh, he's not CIA, like you're an idiot and can't look it up.
[00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:49.752]  Or, oh, Jones is crazy.
[00:14:49.752 --> 00:14:51.134]  There's no coup plan.
[00:14:51.134 --> 00:14:53.396]  No, you just tried to steal the nomination from Trump.
[00:14:53.396 --> 00:14:57.520]  Then you tried to have faithless electors to steal the seating of him.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.263]  Then you've been calling for his death, his murder, his overthrow.
[00:15:00.263 --> 00:15:05.328]  And then have people shopping at former deputy defense secretaries are in foreign affairs
[00:15:06.108 --> 00:15:09.050]  Shopping at the Pentagon of how to overthrow Trump.
[00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:15.635]  They're walking around in offices saying we should have a military overthrow, trying to legitimize it.
[00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:23.980]  I mean, that woman doing that should have been grabbed and tried immediately, or at that level been given, I mean, quite, I'm just telling you what happened in the other country.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.321]  She gets team at shoes.
[00:15:25.321 --> 00:15:32.186]  You know, walking around at the Pentagon saying we need to overthrow Trump in a violent operation.
[00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:37.443]  I mean, these people are, they want violence.
[00:15:37.443 --> 00:15:40.507]  They're openly saying they want to arrest everybody, shut down the press.
[00:15:40.507 --> 00:15:41.408]  They want me dead.
[00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:47.516]  And then they're shocked when I'm up here saying, okay, well, we better have Trump get the public ready to arrest these people.
[00:15:47.516 --> 00:15:49.398]  It's only like a thousand of them.
[00:15:49.398 --> 00:15:51.100]  Give them trials and then put them in prison.
[00:15:52.113 --> 00:15:53.234]  Or teach people a lesson?
[00:15:53.234 --> 00:15:56.317]  I mean, I'm the opposite of a fascist, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:56.317 --> 00:15:57.538]  These are the fascists.
[00:15:57.538 --> 00:15:59.580]  They have to be dealt with just like Nuremberg.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:07.507]  We don't have to go there and have a whole war with these people and a hot civil war via their coups or attempted coups to learn this.
[00:16:07.507 --> 00:16:08.268]  We're right.
[00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:09.489]  We've been proven right.
[00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:10.910]  Everybody needs to understand it.
[00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.912]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:16:12.912 --> 00:16:14.694]  Period.
[00:16:14.694 --> 00:16:16.575]  And the debate is over.
[00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:16.936]  You have
[00:16:17.998 --> 00:16:33.529]  This globalist weasel, Clapper, who is a literal islamicist turd, who is a traitor against this country, so arrogant, he's running his mouth, and has allied with the globalists to open the borders of Europe up, bring in 80% military age men, 10 million
[00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:52.628]  To just piss on everybody and announce, your homes are ours, your women are ours, and we've got Merkel and Clapper and all these, and another Muslim globalist, Obama and his snap and turtle wife, telling our kids what to eat in schools.
[00:16:52.628 --> 00:16:54.609]  I mean, we're in a giant cult here.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.525]  And so we got Clapper on CNN with Wolf Blitzer, who again is an admitted Israeli intelligence operative.
[00:17:01.525 --> 00:17:10.572]  And I'm not against Israel, but he's a big leftist, known Mossad operative, formerly a section chief for Israeli intelligence.
[00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:14.835]  Yes, I'm telling you something that's quasi-classified, but it's known that he worked for Israeli intelligence.
[00:17:14.835 --> 00:17:17.717]  He didn't just work for the IDF's PR firm.
[00:17:17.717 --> 00:17:21.340]  Wolf Blitzer is a foreign agent up there with another Muslim agent.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.501]  I'm going to throw up, man.
[00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:26.690]  All of them want to break America's back because they know they're foreign agents.
[00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:27.252]  And I've had it!
[00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:35.485]  The Chinese foreign agents, and the Islamist foreign agents, and the EU foreign agents, and the pedophile Pope, and their foreign agents.
[00:17:35.485 --> 00:17:38.346]  Okay, I'm ranting.
[00:17:38.346 --> 00:17:40.267]  Let me just play clapper in the interest of time.
[00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:42.588]  We got Owen Schroeder here riding shotgun with us today.
[00:17:42.588 --> 00:17:55.314]  We have the pastor coming on, big national pastor, Mr. Brown, friends of Trump, led the prayer meeting a few weeks ago with Trump, who met with the top congressman, Republican, who said, yeah, they've got the plan, they're getting it ready to have a coup, and in the next 30 days they're planning to do it.
[00:17:56.206 --> 00:18:01.430]  And then notice clappers on CNN going, it's time to have a coup against Trump!
[00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.393]  I mean, you know, he's telling you it's time to have a coup.
[00:18:04.393 --> 00:18:07.175]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:18:07.175 --> 00:18:12.699]  Let's go ahead and play the one minute, ten second clip of everything I told you coming out in the open.
[00:18:12.699 --> 00:18:14.721]  And they come out in the open to normalize it.
[00:18:14.721 --> 00:18:16.662]  You say, well they want surprise.
[00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.084]  No they don't.
[00:18:18.084 --> 00:18:21.006]  They need to carry it out and have everyone go along with it.
[00:18:22.128 --> 00:18:24.489]  That means blow up Marine One when he's flying in it.
[00:18:24.489 --> 00:18:28.890]  That means having, quote, terrorist attack Air Force One on the tarmac.
[00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.411]  That means just SWAT teaming him, you know, just firing rockets into the White House.
[00:18:33.411 --> 00:18:37.112]  I mean, quite frankly, Trump shouldn't even be in the White House right now.
[00:18:37.112 --> 00:18:45.194]  He should go to Fort Meade, or he should go to Cheyenne Mountain, or he should get me an arm and point all this out and put, you know, tanks
[00:18:46.704 --> 00:18:47.184]  I don't know.
[00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:13.320]  We're not just going to have them sell it to the American people and go try it.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.722]  Especially because I'm next in line downhill from this, okay?
[00:19:16.722 --> 00:19:17.862]  This is personal.
[00:19:17.862 --> 00:19:21.484]  And by the way, all of you that claim you want to fight the new world order, this is it.
[00:19:21.484 --> 00:19:26.626]  But you all just expect it was going to take over and you'd have a shootout with some UN troops or something.
[00:19:26.626 --> 00:19:27.606]  That's not how this works.
[00:19:27.606 --> 00:19:29.327]  We started taking the government back.
[00:19:29.327 --> 00:19:31.928]  We're trying to save the country because we love our country.
[00:19:31.928 --> 00:19:38.931]  Not because we're heroes, because we're not going to put up with a bunch of globalist turds like Madeleine Albright and Michael Moore ruling us.
[00:19:39.827 --> 00:19:40.608]  Let's skip this break.
[00:19:40.608 --> 00:19:41.648]  This is too important.
[00:19:41.648 --> 00:19:42.289]  Skip this one break.
[00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:45.051]  I don't think of the network hell about it, but you know what?
[00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:51.056]  If the network doesn't like it, I'm just going to have to move on because our stations, we're going to a new clock starting...
[00:19:52.887 --> 00:19:58.651]  You know, in like a month, the clock everybody wants, there's gonna be less ads, but we're gonna come in at six after, so I'm excited about all that.
[00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:01.573]  But right now, here it is, here is Clapper.
[00:20:01.573 --> 00:20:03.014]  Hey, guess what, Radio Network?
[00:20:03.014 --> 00:20:06.256]  There won't be a show if they win and take over, see?
[00:20:06.256 --> 00:20:06.916]  See how that works?
[00:20:06.916 --> 00:20:08.357]  It's called Life and Death.
[00:20:08.357 --> 00:20:09.798]  I love GCN, they're great folks.
[00:20:09.798 --> 00:20:11.279]  Wanted to skip one break today, though.
[00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:15.562]  Let's go ahead and let's play the clip from El Clapper.
[00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:25.106]  But this is where the work of Robert Mueller is critical to our future as a country because I, you know, in some respects we're a government and a nation in crisis right now.
[00:20:26.215 --> 00:20:28.677]  You have confidence in this special counsel?
[00:20:28.677 --> 00:20:29.757]  Absolutely.
[00:20:29.757 --> 00:20:32.099]  You both worked with him for a long time when he was head of the FBI.
[00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:32.539]  Absolutely.
[00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:34.700]  It was an inspired choice.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.462]  They don't come any better.
[00:20:36.462 --> 00:20:42.305]  Nobody better than Bob Mueller, who is a straight shooter and will not be intimidated by anything.
[00:20:42.305 --> 00:20:50.851]  And if he's fired by Mr. Trump, or is tempted to be fired by Mr. Trump, I hope, I really hope that our members of Congress, our elected representatives, are going to stand up and say enough is enough.
[00:20:51.531 --> 00:20:58.796]  And stop making apologies and excuses for things that are happening that really flout, I think, our system of laws and government here.
[00:20:58.796 --> 00:21:11.665]  When you say enough is enough, if he's fired, and he's the President of the United States, he can tell Rosenstein to fire him if he wants, but if he's fired, what would you want Congress to do?
[00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:22.746]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders that, again, are inconsistent with what this country is all about.
[00:21:22.746 --> 00:21:29.069]  But I would just hope that this is not going to be a partisan issue.
[00:21:29.069 --> 00:21:36.153]  That Republicans and Democrats are going to see that the future of this country is at stake, and there needs to be some things done for the good of the future.
[00:21:37.967 --> 00:21:39.588]  That's Brennan.
[00:21:39.588 --> 00:21:43.192]  He's also up there with Clapper, who told you there's no spy on the American people.
[00:21:43.192 --> 00:21:44.353]  It's all conspiracy theory.
[00:21:44.353 --> 00:21:46.434]  He perjured himself in Congress.
[00:21:46.434 --> 00:21:49.417]  And they think these guys are the co-presidents, along with Mueller.
[00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:53.381]  Like even CNN and others have said, here's really who leads the country.
[00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:57.524]  It's Brennan, it's Clapper, and it's Mueller.
[00:21:57.524 --> 00:22:03.770]  And they're worshiping Comey, this Clinton appointee, this Obama appointee, this incredibly
[00:22:06.809 --> 00:22:26.863]  Corrupt minion who 99.8% of their donations from Mueller's law firm go to the Democrats and go to Hillary and everyone they've appointed on Mueller's team other than Mueller is Democrat and two of them were fired by Trump.
[00:22:26.863 --> 00:22:33.067]  That'd be like if I was in a divorce proceeding or you were in a divorce proceeding and let's say your husband was a judge.
[00:22:34.284 --> 00:22:43.126]  And then he's the family court judge and you've got, say, five kids and you go in and then he's not going to recuse himself when it comes up that he's supposed to be the person hearing the case.
[00:22:43.126 --> 00:22:48.548]  Your husband hears his own divorce case.
[00:22:48.548 --> 00:22:49.708]  That's right.
[00:22:49.708 --> 00:22:51.229]  And that's what this is.
[00:22:51.229 --> 00:22:56.210]  And they openly have Mueller's people out there shooting their mouth off in the news and then using
[00:22:57.552 --> 00:23:14.355]  NSA data transcripts that they've had from the beginning of a few meetings when Russians are coming out of the woodwork, where the Trumps are meeting with Russians to try to get dirt on Hillary, who's known to have the Russians all in her business.
[00:23:14.355 --> 00:23:15.096]  So think about that.
[00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:20.003]  They think you're so incredibly stupid.
[00:23:20.003 --> 00:23:22.223]  And then they say, oh, we never spied.
[00:23:22.223 --> 00:23:24.844]  Remember back in a few months ago, there was a big controversy.
[00:23:24.844 --> 00:23:25.584]  Trump's a liar.
[00:23:25.584 --> 00:23:26.624]  Trump's crazy.
[00:23:26.624 --> 00:23:28.845]  No one ever spied on him.
[00:23:28.845 --> 00:23:31.025]  The NSA never spied on him or anybody.
[00:23:31.025 --> 00:23:36.806]  When they've been in the news saying we have NSA transcripts proving all this, but wouldn't show them because they didn't really show what they said.
[00:23:36.806 --> 00:23:38.267]  Then they go, oh, no, we never did that.
[00:23:38.267 --> 00:23:38.947]  Now they're back again.
[00:23:38.947 --> 00:23:44.048]  Oh, we do have all the intercepts and we were spying on them, but it's no big deal.
[00:23:45.302 --> 00:23:48.443]  Just like they have the Comey memo showing that Comey had done all this.
[00:23:48.443 --> 00:23:49.904]  Oh, excuse me, Freudian slip.
[00:23:49.904 --> 00:23:58.767]  They have the Comey memo where he illegally didn't give it to the Attorney General at the time, Loretta Lynch.
[00:23:58.767 --> 00:24:01.828]  And then Jeff Sessions.
[00:24:01.828 --> 00:24:04.929]  Where he held on to it, obviously for blackmail.
[00:24:04.929 --> 00:24:08.450]  It was a classified memo, obviously a conversation with the President in private.
[00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.071]  He said it wasn't classified and perjured himself to Congress.
[00:24:14.158 --> 00:24:18.482]  Then he tried to hold it over the president's head, but the president bluffed him and said, we may have recordings.
[00:24:18.482 --> 00:24:20.263]  So he changed his story over and over again.
[00:24:20.263 --> 00:24:35.717]  And then meanwhile, we know he was the main leaker and he admitted to being the leaker because he knew that Trump knew, because now that he was the president, he was able to have people go in and look at the NSA and see what they were up to and what they were doing.
[00:24:35.717 --> 00:24:41.082]  But because it's classified, he won't talk about it and defend himself.
[00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:51.354]  So that's how this whole wicked web that they've woven traverses this situation.
[00:24:51.354 --> 00:25:08.282]  And you have these arrogant, entitled, crazy people that are so arrogant that a newly elected president, about to be sworn in in two days, you go on national TV and you say, you better watch your mouth.
[00:25:08.282 --> 00:25:10.563]  And then Schumer scrabbles onto CNN,
[00:25:12.356 --> 00:25:22.938]  The day after the president's sworn in and says, the president better watch out, the intelligence community has seven ways to Sunday to get even with you.
[00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:25.319]  But then they go, oh, we're not getting even.
[00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:27.319]  Intelligence agencies aren't doing anything.
[00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:28.760]  We just have all these intercepts.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.980]  But just like Comey said, the memo had all this dirt.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.702]  When he finally had to produce it to Congress in secret, it didn't have anything in it.
[00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:38.622]  And it was word for word what Trump had ever said.
[00:25:42.159 --> 00:25:43.420]  According to Congress, we don't know.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:54.764]  It probably said that Trump, you know, was evil and tried to buy him off, but he'd already testified that that hadn't happened on February 3rd, so then he couldn't perjure himself.
[00:25:54.764 --> 00:26:00.467]  See, Trump's got them caught on so many fronts, and they realize that, and so here's the $64 trillion answer.
[00:26:02.176 --> 00:26:03.157]  They're desperate.
[00:26:03.157 --> 00:26:04.037]  They're losing.
[00:26:04.037 --> 00:26:07.699]  They've lost control of the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
[00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:10.981]  They've lost control of 30-plus state houses.
[00:26:10.981 --> 00:26:14.403]  They've lost control of close to 1,000 state reps.
[00:26:14.403 --> 00:26:17.204]  They've lost control of many of the mayors.
[00:26:17.204 --> 00:26:24.669]  Right now, the country, electorally, is about 70% Republican.
[00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:28.271]  That's why you look at a map, everything's blue, but a few red spots
[00:26:29.252 --> 00:26:34.818]  On the east and west coast and a few areas in Minnesota and Wisconsin and Chicago.
[00:26:34.818 --> 00:26:37.281]  And all of those are the high crime areas.
[00:26:37.281 --> 00:26:40.925]  All of those are the globalist areas that are under their big city control.
[00:26:40.925 --> 00:26:42.066]  Very, very sad.
[00:26:42.066 --> 00:26:44.849]  And they understand that existentially there's an awakening.
[00:26:45.632 --> 00:26:46.873]  And that they're losing control.
[00:26:46.873 --> 00:26:50.737]  And that they're not going to be able to teach your five-year-old, you know, how to be a trainee.
[00:26:50.737 --> 00:26:53.340]  And they're not going to be able to have the military wear red high heels.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:59.807]  They're not going to be able to bring in 50 million Muslims that will be our bosses and be the CPS workers of the new police like they are in Germany.
[00:26:59.807 --> 00:27:07.675]  They understand their plan to kind of have their way with us, because that's the big goal, is to have this existential victory over everybody.
[00:27:07.675 --> 00:27:07.935]  This giant
[00:27:09.699 --> 00:27:13.521]  Season of the cuck, this giant beta orgy.
[00:27:13.521 --> 00:27:16.022]  That's what communism and these authoritarian things are.
[00:27:16.022 --> 00:27:20.485]  It's people that don't want to build things or do things or create things or fight for things.
[00:27:20.485 --> 00:27:28.009]  They just get together in big swarms and then come in and try to pull everything down as some simulated victory.
[00:27:28.009 --> 00:27:29.870]  It's what's going on in Venezuela.
[00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.230]  It's what's happening in North Korea.
[00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.032]  It's what's happening in many, many areas of the world, but all over the planet.
[00:27:36.707 --> 00:27:47.290]  Countries are coming out of these cycles and experiencing these hells, and because of travel and the internet, the general public knows that globalism is a fraud.
[00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.510]  They know that globalism doesn't produce.
[00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:54.811]  They know it's designed to get people into poverty, and they're rejecting it across the board.
[00:27:54.811 --> 00:28:05.354]  So when we come back, I'm going to play that boil down of other big TV hosts and analysts saying they want a coup, but see, oh, we don't need them anymore, do we, to say, oh, look, I'm right.
[00:28:06.598 --> 00:28:23.664]  We have Clapper, former head of all 17 agencies, and then you've got the former CIA director, Brennan, running his mouth saying we need Republicans and Democrats to come together
[00:28:25.014 --> 00:28:28.217]  Bipartisanly, and just agree we need to remove Trump.
[00:28:28.217 --> 00:28:52.758]  That's the talking point, but they think Congress is so dumb, and a lot of them are just lazy narcissists that got hired, that they're not even reading Foreign Affairs, Public Affairs, and Atlantic Monthly, which you really should read if you want to know, because the criminals can't help but brag, and they're in there going, we're going to have a whole new election run by Homeland Security, already under an executive order by Obama, and we're going to oversee and make sure that nothing ever happens again.
[00:28:55.512 --> 00:29:02.479]  Like what just happened in 2016, and we're going to have new elections and remove all these people because they all got elected illegally.
[00:29:02.479 --> 00:29:16.373]  They're not going to just sit there and let you go, oh, you're bipartisan and we all agree to say, oh, Trump's an evil Nixon and go along with it and all have another, you know, phony consensus thing where we feel like we're part of the process, but we're really chump idiot morons.
[00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:25.171]  Leadership is doing the right thing when you see a wall telling you that you're wrong and a bunch of peer pressure telling you you're going to lose.
[00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:26.933]  I know we're going to win.
[00:29:26.933 --> 00:29:27.973]  We have the moral authority.
[00:29:27.973 --> 00:29:29.375]  We have history on our side.
[00:29:29.375 --> 00:29:30.255]  We have the facts.
[00:29:30.255 --> 00:29:31.937]  We have a strong president.
[00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:33.918]  We have histories tied on our side.
[00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:46.687]  We've become so peer pressure driven and so delusional, America could snap back into that delusion and buy into the hype and say, well, I was for Trump, but you know the Russia thing, and go along with it.
[00:29:46.687 --> 00:29:49.289]  Especially if you see him get, you know, killed in the middle of the night.
[00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:50.050]  Play along with that.
[00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.312]  If you do that, you deserve everything you get.
[00:29:52.312 --> 00:29:54.193]  Because it's not going to give us any quarter then.
[00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:56.735]  They're going to come after everybody.
[00:29:56.735 --> 00:29:58.116]  We're on the march.
[00:29:58.116 --> 00:30:00.638]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:00.638 --> 00:30:03.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.362 --> 00:30:09.823]  December 23rd, 1776.
[00:30:09.823 --> 00:30:13.805]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[00:30:13.805 --> 00:30:18.827]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[00:30:18.827 --> 00:30:23.609]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[00:30:23.609 --> 00:30:26.251]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[00:30:26.251 --> 00:30:28.312]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[00:30:28.312 --> 00:30:31.253]  At the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[00:30:31.253 --> 00:30:34.275]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[00:30:34.275 --> 00:30:36.936]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:45.962]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[00:30:45.962 --> 00:30:54.328]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[00:30:54.328 --> 00:30:59.592]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[00:30:59.592 --> 00:31:04.575]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[00:31:05.456 --> 00:31:08.298]  Thomas Paine, the American Crisis.
[00:31:08.298 --> 00:31:10.180]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.202]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:12.202 --> 00:31:15.104]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:15.104 --> 00:31:21.189]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:21.189 --> 00:31:28.535]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[00:31:28.675 --> 00:31:30.356]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:35.417]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:31:35.417 --> 00:31:37.898]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:37.898 --> 00:31:45.921]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:45.921 --> 00:31:46.881]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:48.098 --> 00:31:51.479]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:51.479 --> 00:31:55.601]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:55.601 --> 00:32:02.324]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:32:02.324 --> 00:32:06.406]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:32:08.419 --> 00:32:14.221]  Today, I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[00:32:14.221 --> 00:32:22.885]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[00:32:22.885 --> 00:32:30.768]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[00:32:30.768 --> 00:32:36.910]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:40.312]  NAR Lipoic Acid, Bio-PQQ and many others.
[00:32:40.312 --> 00:32:45.015]  Bio-PQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[00:32:45.015 --> 00:32:48.797]  And just one batch of this stuff cost us more than $30,000.
[00:32:48.797 --> 00:32:51.499]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[00:32:51.499 --> 00:32:59.644]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third party certified review agency, Power Review.
[00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:05.208]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com before it sells out again.
[00:33:05.208 --> 00:33:06.369]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:24.498 --> 00:33:30.003]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:30.003 --> 00:33:38.370]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:43.975]  So... There's no more speculation.
[00:33:43.975 --> 00:33:45.937]  It's all confirmed.
[00:33:45.937 --> 00:33:47.619]  We can see the whole thing.
[00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:51.182]  A group of arrogant criminals, Brennan Clapper,
[00:33:53.277 --> 00:34:15.603]  The Clintons, Chuckie Schumer, Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, a bunch of doddering, arrogant sycophants in power so long, they thought Hillary was going to win and had hundreds of thousands of Madam President Newsweeks printed up.
[00:34:15.603 --> 00:34:19.384]  They knew Trump was 15 points ahead in all the internal polls, some of them higher.
[00:34:20.506 --> 00:34:34.449]  But they tried to steal the election that night, but state officials in six states in the South were there watching them, Homeland Security trying to break in in live time, and to activate the computer programs they'd already put into the software to steal the election.
[00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:38.470]  Election officials in five states blocked it.
[00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:43.071]  They were not able to block it in some areas of the West.
[00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:44.632]  Trump won.
[00:34:44.632 --> 00:34:45.132]  They panicked.
[00:34:46.107 --> 00:34:49.290]  Sign an executive order to federalize all elections.
[00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:55.155]  All 50 attorney generals, including Democrats in 19 states, sent letters saying, don't do this.
[00:34:55.155 --> 00:34:58.538]  This breaks the federalist system of 1798.
[00:34:58.538 --> 00:35:05.023]  But they don't care.
[00:35:05.023 --> 00:35:06.945]  They're going ahead with it.
[00:35:06.945 --> 00:35:07.826]  They lost.
[00:35:07.826 --> 00:35:09.207]  They can't stand it.
[00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:12.730]  And you've got this group of criminals, openly,
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:20.523]  Saying they want a military coup, a sudden removal of the president.
[00:35:20.523 --> 00:35:41.994]  Just two days ago, it's big national news that a top evangelical pastor, that's Trump's friend, Mr. Brown, who's been in tyranny before, fled South Africa, as it collapsed, said he met with a senior congressman who said they're planning a violent coup soon.
[00:35:43.467 --> 00:35:46.448]  The armed removal of the President.
[00:35:46.448 --> 00:35:48.568]  Then he went and told 700 Club the details.
[00:35:48.568 --> 00:35:53.570]  The 700 Club taped it, but wouldn't air it out of fear.
[00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.350]  Because, again, people are scared.
[00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.231]  You better be scared of not being all in.
[00:35:59.231 --> 00:36:02.952]  We will win 100% if people just aren't cowards.
[00:36:02.952 --> 00:36:06.212]  Everyone should be scared of being cowards.
[00:36:06.212 --> 00:36:07.793]  Everyone should be scared of not
[00:36:08.755 --> 00:36:12.617]  Being vocal right now and calling C-SPAN and shooting your own videos.
[00:36:12.617 --> 00:36:15.779]  If you've never been on YouTube, call your neighbor that knows how to get online.
[00:36:15.779 --> 00:36:18.861]  I don't care if you're 80 years old or 15.
[00:36:18.861 --> 00:36:21.663]  Go shoot a video saying, we don't want a coup against Trump.
[00:36:21.663 --> 00:36:31.029]  Imagine if our listeners, millions of them, all went and just shot videos saying, we don't want martial law, we don't want a coup, don't kill our president.
[00:36:31.029 --> 00:36:34.231]  Or if you just shot videos saying, pray for our president and then explain why.
[00:36:35.546 --> 00:36:54.641]  If there were millions of YouTube videos, it would change the world, because it would flood YouTube, and many of the videos would get hundreds of thousands of views, some would get millions of views, they would get hundreds of millions of views together, and just that type of mass action by you would derail everything they're doing.
[00:36:54.641 --> 00:36:59.005]  In fact, the new contest we announced for $20,000, we just paid out last week on the last one,
[00:37:00.137 --> 00:37:07.083]  It's almost a distraction, you know, the song, and making jokes out of it, and exposing Hillary, and the whole martial law plan, and the Islamic invasion.
[00:37:07.083 --> 00:37:10.305]  You do anything you want in the video, just remake the song, add new lyrics, I don't care.
[00:37:10.305 --> 00:37:12.467]  It's whatever's the best is gonna win.
[00:37:12.467 --> 00:37:16.390]  $10,000 for one place, $5,000 for the other two places, so there's three prizes.
[00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:20.093]  There's like a first big prize, and there's two other sub-prizes.
[00:37:20.093 --> 00:37:22.315]  We really should just not even have to pay for this.
[00:37:22.315 --> 00:37:25.317]  I just had money to make it exciting and to honor, you know, folks to take action.
[00:37:26.212 --> 00:37:27.453]  Just makes it more fun.
[00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:29.954]  But everybody should be calling their local talk radio.
[00:37:29.954 --> 00:37:32.435]  They should be calling C-SPAN.
[00:37:32.435 --> 00:37:43.181]  That's why we've put together little videos that show all these major leaders admitting there's a plan for martial law, a plan to shut down the free press, a plan to kill Trump, a plan for a coup!
[00:37:45.168 --> 00:37:59.221]  That is sensational, and we just can't let them go around and normalize it and go, all reasonable Americans agree, we've got to have a coup against the President, and if he refuses to go, it's going to have to be sudden, and it's not going to be pretty.
[00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:02.524]  You know, we're going to have to kill the President.
[00:38:02.524 --> 00:38:04.005]  It's what they're talking about.
[00:38:04.005 --> 00:38:05.767]  It's liberal.
[00:38:05.767 --> 00:38:07.829]  We told him to shut his mouth.
[00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:09.631]  We told you, the voter, to shut your...
[00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.451]  That's basically what they're saying.
[00:38:13.451 --> 00:38:16.953]  No, no, no, no blasphemy intended.
[00:38:16.953 --> 00:38:18.494]  That's what they're saying.
[00:38:18.494 --> 00:38:20.155]  They are damned to hell.
[00:38:20.155 --> 00:38:24.278]  And they want to damn us to hell.
[00:38:24.278 --> 00:38:31.304]  You know, if somebody's trying to damn us to communist hell, it's not taking the Lord's name in vain when that's what they're doing.
[00:38:31.304 --> 00:38:35.006]  It's in vain to say GD just to say it because you stubbed your toe.
[00:38:35.006 --> 00:38:39.670]  When you're explaining that these people want to help us be damned to hell, that's what it is.
[00:38:40.478 --> 00:38:56.391]  A living hell under them with senile, insane, narcissistic fruit loops like Nancy Pelosi running around thinking you can't have guns and you can't have prosperity because she's going to run your life because she's worth a billion dollars.
[00:38:56.391 --> 00:38:58.353]  And her husband's worth more.
[00:38:58.353 --> 00:39:02.516]  And when she got to Congress, the witch was worth nothing.
[00:39:02.516 --> 00:39:07.640]  She'd never done anything in her life but suck off people and get biotech money and everything else.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.261]  She's a witch.
[00:39:10.987 --> 00:39:13.529]  And she thinks she's better than you and your family.
[00:39:13.529 --> 00:39:16.931]  And she thinks she's won when she knows what planet she's on.
[00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:18.433]  You're like, well, yeah, they're so pathetic.
[00:39:19.332 --> 00:39:20.573]  Why is it such an uphill battle?
[00:39:20.573 --> 00:39:22.473]  Because the public's still asleep.
[00:39:22.473 --> 00:39:23.594]  They're a little bit awake.
[00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:25.035]  They like being avant-garde.
[00:39:25.035 --> 00:39:26.635]  They like the raciness of Trump.
[00:39:26.635 --> 00:39:31.558]  They like the fact that it's kind of bad and, you know, we're going up against the MSN and being politically incorrect.
[00:39:31.558 --> 00:39:32.958]  It's kind of cute.
[00:39:32.958 --> 00:39:35.299]  That's getting him elected was cute.
[00:39:35.299 --> 00:39:46.345]  This is the real war now, ladies and gentlemen, with people allied with radical, hardcore, orthodox Islam who funded Islam to murder hundreds of thousands of Christians
[00:39:47.225 --> 00:39:48.925]  That's a conservative number.
[00:39:48.925 --> 00:39:53.747]  And make millions of others flee and murder over a million non-radical Muslims.
[00:39:53.747 --> 00:39:58.608]  That is, heretic Muslims, you know, that let their daughters go to school and drive cars and be doctors.
[00:39:58.608 --> 00:40:01.889]  They all got raped or killed.
[00:40:01.889 --> 00:40:03.189]  And then the invasion of Europe.
[00:40:03.189 --> 00:40:04.569]  These people hate us.
[00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:06.450]  They're allied with anything evil.
[00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.610]  It's their nature.
[00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.591]  And if you don't understand that they resonate towards trash,
[00:40:14.224 --> 00:40:21.547]  You think Michael Moore likes seeing strong, good-looking Americans with good-looking families that are successful and focused and have the light of goodness in their eyes?
[00:40:21.547 --> 00:40:22.088]  No.
[00:40:22.088 --> 00:40:24.249]  These people want to pull you down.
[00:40:24.249 --> 00:40:24.889]  Look at the Clintons.
[00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.089]  It's well-known in psychology.
[00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:33.193]  They surround themselves with weird pedophiles and weird, the ugliest physical people they can that don't bathe.
[00:40:33.193 --> 00:40:34.573]  Mousey Tongue didn't bathe either.
[00:40:34.573 --> 00:40:35.634]  That's the thing about these people.
[00:40:35.634 --> 00:40:37.295]  They don't like to smell good.
[00:40:37.295 --> 00:40:39.296]  I mean, it's just their psychology.
[00:40:39.296 --> 00:40:39.996]  They're trash.
[00:40:41.926 --> 00:40:45.968]  And so what are they going to do that they've made fun of me saying there's a coup plan and a martial law plan?
[00:40:45.968 --> 00:40:51.950]  Now that they're out there selling it, like we're just going to have them play the game of while they're getting ready for it to just go, Oh, it doesn't exist.
[00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:55.292]  You just said you're planning it, but you patted me on the head and said it didn't exist.
[00:40:55.292 --> 00:41:00.874]  So I'm going to shut up now.
[00:41:00.874 --> 00:41:09.938]  Let's go ahead and play a compilation of some of the people that picked up my talking points word for word, that it's a clear and present danger.
[00:41:11.032 --> 00:41:15.476]  I love how the Washington Post went, look, Hannity's quoting Jones exactly.
[00:41:15.476 --> 00:41:24.083]  You don't think Hannity just went on air and said all that stuff word for word, but I said because he just thought that up for his people.
[00:41:24.083 --> 00:41:26.465]  Put that in the teleprompter.
[00:41:26.465 --> 00:41:31.589]  My analysis of this is dead on and has been adopted by the White House.
[00:41:32.594 --> 00:41:34.656]  And I'm wanting Media Matters to pick it up.
[00:41:34.656 --> 00:41:35.336]  What are you going to do?
[00:41:35.336 --> 00:41:45.665]  As your own people called for the exact coup I exposed, and then now the White House has done an analysis and confirmed exactly what I said, and so they've obviously met with patriots, and now the warning's being put out?
[00:41:45.665 --> 00:41:49.388]  What, that I saw the British coming and I yelled it, and now the British are marching up the road?
[00:41:49.388 --> 00:41:52.250]  And you're going to go, oh look, he said they were coming and they are!
[00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.871]  He's a kook!
[00:41:54.798 --> 00:42:09.062]  Again, they play those mind games where it isn't about the substance, it's about being laughed at, because the average alone trendy, as the Facebook documents this year that came out showed, headline, Facebook targets lonely liberals.
[00:42:09.062 --> 00:42:10.482]  Trendies.
[00:42:10.482 --> 00:42:13.303]  But if you read the documents, it actually, the Australian
[00:42:14.588 --> 00:42:17.030]  Newspapers, the Australian, didn't get it completely right.
[00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:32.286]  The document's about making you fake liberal, making you alone, having fake bots that keep you alone, and then you go out with the bots and attack libertarians, conservatives, and you feel like you're winning because it's 10 to 1 bots ridiculing conservatives to make us feel little.
[00:42:32.286 --> 00:42:36.530]  We know it's Tokyo Rose, again, broadcasting that we failed, we've lost.
[00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:37.971]  In fact, I want to do a promo video.
[00:42:38.832 --> 00:42:45.493]  That shows Tokyo Rose, you know, the radio transmissions saying, oh, GI, your wife's going to die.
[00:42:45.493 --> 00:42:46.014]  You're going to die.
[00:42:46.014 --> 00:42:46.714]  You'll never see her.
[00:42:46.714 --> 00:42:48.194]  We're beating you.
[00:42:48.194 --> 00:42:50.334]  Yes, you know.
[00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:54.455]  Even as Japan was falling, they were still saying it, just like Baghdad, Bob, 2003.
[00:42:54.455 --> 00:43:00.797]  The Iraqi Ministry of Information head, the troops are entering Baghdad.
[00:43:00.797 --> 00:43:02.657]  They're like two miles away.
[00:43:02.657 --> 00:43:05.077]  Bombs are going off behind him.
[00:43:05.077 --> 00:43:07.378]  You can see mushroom clouds like two miles behind.
[00:43:08.444 --> 00:43:10.325]  He's actually ducking a few times.
[00:43:10.325 --> 00:43:12.327]  We have defeated the Americans.
[00:43:12.327 --> 00:43:14.469]  They have been driven into Kuwait.
[00:43:14.469 --> 00:43:16.550]  They are nowhere here.
[00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:23.075]  The pigs have never... Baghdad Bob, you know, they make comedy videos of him.
[00:43:23.075 --> 00:43:26.217]  That's what this is.
[00:43:26.217 --> 00:43:28.199]  That's what this is.
[00:43:28.199 --> 00:43:28.819]  But you know what?
[00:43:28.819 --> 00:43:32.462]  They've still got a bigger beachhead than Baghdad Bob did.
[00:43:32.462 --> 00:43:33.463]  That little island he was on.
[00:43:37.136 --> 00:43:45.741]  And so, to their audience, they are going to just laugh and go, oh look, Jones said the chemicals are making the frogs have sexual problems.
[00:43:45.741 --> 00:43:54.687]  Doesn't matter if it's in thousands of publications, The Nature Science, all of it, Smithsonian, Fish and Wildlife Service, doesn't matter.
[00:43:54.687 --> 00:43:58.469]  Just laugh and the people think, oh, look, we're back in junior high.
[00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:02.652]  The big cool kid, Stephen Colbert, pointed at me and laughed at me.
[00:44:05.663 --> 00:44:07.684]  They're Arrested Development.
[00:44:07.684 --> 00:44:08.625]  I feel sorry for them.
[00:44:08.625 --> 00:44:09.746]  They're the nerds.
[00:44:09.746 --> 00:44:12.267]  They always wanted to be in the in-group show.
[00:44:12.267 --> 00:44:14.829]  College and all of it is about, oh, you're liberal now.
[00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:15.710]  You're a globalist now.
[00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:16.790]  You get here.
[00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.271]  You're anti-American.
[00:44:18.271 --> 00:44:20.653]  You're anti-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant.
[00:44:20.653 --> 00:44:22.014]  You're anti-Christian.
[00:44:22.014 --> 00:44:23.955]  You're anti-white, even if you're white.
[00:44:23.955 --> 00:44:25.876]  This is your new culture.
[00:44:25.876 --> 00:44:26.777]  You're anti-West.
[00:44:26.777 --> 00:44:28.118]  You're anti-free market.
[00:44:28.118 --> 00:44:30.539]  You're for Che Guevara.
[00:44:30.539 --> 00:44:34.042]  Because they don't want you to have that birthright as an American, regardless of what color you are.
[00:44:35.012 --> 00:44:36.154]  They're stunting you.
[00:44:36.154 --> 00:44:38.658]  And people go, oh, I'm finally in the in crowd.
[00:44:40.623 --> 00:44:42.783]  Because they were never in the in crowd.
[00:44:42.783 --> 00:44:43.604]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:44:43.604 --> 00:44:48.044]  That's what Madison Avenue and that's what Wall Street and that's what the PR firms.
[00:44:48.044 --> 00:44:53.165]  It's all about making you feel disempowered until you buy into their culture.
[00:44:53.165 --> 00:44:57.806]  And so you think you're in the chosen group when you're in a failure chump group.
[00:44:57.806 --> 00:45:01.747]  In all the WikiLeaks, Hillary goes, I'm so sick of our people.
[00:45:01.747 --> 00:45:06.308]  They have their such basement dwelling with their parent baristas.
[00:45:06.308 --> 00:45:06.828]  Those are quotes.
[00:45:08.885 --> 00:45:11.746]  Just like Facebook says.
[00:45:11.746 --> 00:45:13.026]  We've got them.
[00:45:13.026 --> 00:45:14.867]  They're alone.
[00:45:14.867 --> 00:45:18.588]  We found that we can isolate them completely with algorithms.
[00:45:18.588 --> 00:45:22.649]  They will give us all their money and culturally we'll be under our full control.
[00:45:22.649 --> 00:45:25.689]  Same program in Europe, same program here, same program.
[00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:30.571]  And you see these desperate trendies, totally empty, four or five degrees, no future.
[00:45:30.571 --> 00:45:34.972]  And the bots are there isolating them and the bots know the different
[00:45:36.073 --> 00:45:56.099]  Substrata and who their friends are and then we'll hit them with messages in the bots that will drive them away from friends they have on Facebook and Twitter that are real who are more nationalistic or more alive and who were just using Facebook as like an email system or a way to contact folks and knew it was a joke but just had it as one more thing.
[00:45:57.346 --> 00:45:58.467]  This is all in there.
[00:45:58.467 --> 00:46:09.538]  And I've had, quote, friends and people who get in there with the bots attacking them, and then the few friends they've got are under the same bots because they're in the same kind of little re-education camp brainwashing center.
[00:46:09.538 --> 00:46:10.800]  This is what Facebook admits they are.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.163]  And then they go, I just can't be involved with this Trump thing.
[00:46:14.163 --> 00:46:14.764]  You're a kook.
[00:46:14.764 --> 00:46:15.424]  You're nuts.
[00:46:15.424 --> 00:46:16.586]  I'm not happy.
[00:46:16.586 --> 00:46:18.287]  Everyone's against me online.
[00:46:18.287 --> 00:46:19.569]  All my friends are ridiculing me.
[00:46:19.569 --> 00:46:20.389]  And I look at them and I go,
[00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:22.471]  Let's go look at these people.
[00:46:22.471 --> 00:46:27.673]  If you ever met these people, I go, look, this person just posted on hundreds of other profiles the same second.
[00:46:27.673 --> 00:46:28.834]  That's a bot.
[00:46:28.834 --> 00:46:31.095]  There are people managing this, but these are bots.
[00:46:31.095 --> 00:46:32.116]  Here's the news articles.
[00:46:32.116 --> 00:46:34.177]  And they go, no, no, no.
[00:46:34.177 --> 00:46:37.378]  And then they go and they join it and go, I'm no longer with Alex Jones.
[00:46:37.378 --> 00:46:37.658]  I don't.
[00:46:37.658 --> 00:46:38.899]  And they go, oh, we love you.
[00:46:38.899 --> 00:46:43.201]  And the bots all run in all little fake avatar simulations.
[00:46:43.201 --> 00:46:46.203]  You're already in the matrix.
[00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:48.164]  You're already in the baby pool matrix.
[00:46:50.247 --> 00:46:58.350]  You're in there with a handful of real people who are totally insecure, who want to be given participation medals, participation trophies, and patted on the head.
[00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:02.812]  And in the cool group, they wait when the little nerd buses come in at the universities.
[00:47:02.812 --> 00:47:04.273]  This has been leaked.
[00:47:04.273 --> 00:47:15.938]  And they have psychological experts that go out and go, there's racism on campus, there's KKK, we've had crosses burned this week, swastikas painted, come into this dorm area, and they go, you're not safe at the college, you're here, you're here.
[00:47:17.038 --> 00:47:19.260]  The college is like 60% minority.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:20.381]  Nothing's ever really happened there.
[00:47:20.381 --> 00:47:21.381]  Everybody's being nice.
[00:47:21.381 --> 00:47:23.463]  Everybody's, you know, being trendy, whatever.
[00:47:23.463 --> 00:47:28.006]  And they go, we're going to put you through some debriefing, who your friends are.
[00:47:28.006 --> 00:47:32.370]  We're going to get you organized with us to stand up against the racism and the systemic evil.
[00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:43.558]  And you're so brainwashed in the new gang you've been put into, the new boot camp you've been put into, torn down, built back up, that six months later, you're taking over the park and saying, no whites allowed.
[00:47:43.558 --> 00:47:46.000]  And saying, this weekend, no whites on campus.
[00:47:47.503 --> 00:47:52.367]  And then the only whites allowed are ones that say, I'm evil, I'm bad, I admit it.
[00:47:52.367 --> 00:47:53.207]  Cult.
[00:47:53.207 --> 00:47:53.948]  Cult.
[00:47:53.948 --> 00:47:54.648]  Cult.
[00:47:54.648 --> 00:47:55.289]  Cult.
[00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:55.829]  Cult.
[00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:56.190]  Cult.
[00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.470]  Cult.
[00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:58.652]  You're in a cult and they love it.
[00:47:58.652 --> 00:48:01.714]  You know what the Infowars cult is?
[00:48:01.714 --> 00:48:10.361]  Rediscovering America, rediscovering freedom, rediscovering individualism, rediscovering prosperity, but realizing prosperity creates incredible decadence.
[00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:15.384]  And so that's the byproduct of it we've all got to deal with.
[00:48:19.113 --> 00:48:23.855]  When we come back, I'm going to play Clapper one more time and then get Owen in here, who's riding shotgun with me when I'm on remote.
[00:48:23.855 --> 00:48:25.635]  He's been doing a great job with David Knight the last few days.
[00:48:25.635 --> 00:48:29.196]  But just briefly, we're under attack.
[00:48:29.196 --> 00:48:32.938]  We're under, secondarily, we are the main target.
[00:48:32.938 --> 00:48:38.039]  Trump's number one, InfoWars is number two, because they understand we're figureheads, we're focal points to demonize you.
[00:48:38.039 --> 00:48:43.061]  If they can make us fall or make the public buy into our destruction, then they can buy into your destruction.
[00:48:44.031 --> 00:48:48.456]  It's an archetype now, like a tarot card, a symbol in the card deck, okay?
[00:48:48.456 --> 00:48:53.302]  And so, it's bigger than me or Trump, it's about you.
[00:48:53.302 --> 00:48:59.669]  We need your financial support now more than ever, and we also need you to wear InfoWars t-shirts and Trump t-shirts in public.
[00:48:59.669 --> 00:49:02.132]  Now, if you go to a leftist part of town, they may attack you.
[00:49:02.412 --> 00:49:04.734]  And so if you want an excuse to defend yourself, that's fine.
[00:49:04.734 --> 00:49:05.734]  I'm not recommending it.
[00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:09.857]  But InfoWars shirts in most areas will get lunch bought for you, or you'll meet like-minded people.
[00:49:09.857 --> 00:49:15.782]  But it's about community, it's about exercising it or losing it, just like we exercised the Second Amendment, we've got to exercise the first.
[00:49:15.782 --> 00:49:21.326]  So get all the different CNN or terrorist shirts, CNN's fake news shirts, InfoWars.com is real news on the back.
[00:49:23.012 --> 00:49:31.684]  Supermill Vitality is again about to sell out, so that sales over just like X2 is over, just like Rainforest did sell out, that's over, but I'm told more is coming in a few weeks.
[00:49:31.684 --> 00:49:37.331]  Super Female is basically the same formula, but it has one herb's weaker and one herb's stronger.
[00:49:38.214 --> 00:49:39.535]  Okay.
[00:49:39.535 --> 00:49:40.795]  It works just as good in men.
[00:49:40.795 --> 00:49:47.079]  It's just more, has more of an aphrodisiac edge to it with a super female, just the way it's designed.
[00:49:47.079 --> 00:49:47.879]  It's amazing.
[00:49:47.879 --> 00:49:49.580]  It's high quality.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:50.921]  People really love it.
[00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:55.203]  It is 57% off retail.
[00:49:55.203 --> 00:49:56.504]  And it's not because it hasn't been selling.
[00:49:56.504 --> 00:49:57.784]  It never sells as good as super male.
[00:49:57.784 --> 00:50:01.326]  It's just that I've never done something that's basically almost a lost leader.
[00:50:01.326 --> 00:50:01.846]  We make like $5 on it.
[00:50:03.306 --> 00:50:08.650]  I want to sell it at this price because I want women to experience it who've never done it.
[00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.631]  This is your time.
[00:50:09.631 --> 00:50:17.557]  But men, some men, including myself, like Super Female better than the Super Male system.
[00:50:17.557 --> 00:50:19.138]  Anthroplex is excellent as well.
[00:50:19.138 --> 00:50:20.779]  It's really strong, but it's powder form.
[00:50:20.779 --> 00:50:22.941]  It's not cold pressed, so it's less expensive.
[00:50:22.941 --> 00:50:25.883]  But at this price, it's the same price right now as Super Female.
[00:50:25.883 --> 00:50:27.004]  But Anthroplex is amazing.
[00:50:27.004 --> 00:50:28.184]  A lot of women like it as well.
[00:50:29.145 --> 00:50:29.665]  We're good to go.
[00:50:49.392 --> 00:50:52.254]  A great president once said, the nine most feared words in the English language.
[00:50:52.254 --> 00:50:55.956]  I am from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:51:15.749 --> 00:51:18.952]  Adequacy of loss, absorbing capacity.
[00:51:18.952 --> 00:51:20.253]  You call that help?
[00:51:20.253 --> 00:51:22.455]  That's the mandate approved by the G20.
[00:51:22.455 --> 00:51:24.556]  The banks can steal your money!
[00:51:24.556 --> 00:51:26.718]  Well, they can't steal your gold and silver.
[00:51:26.718 --> 00:51:35.726]  That you fully control, you can have it delivered into an IRA at a depository under lock and key, where you can hide it, where no one can find it, not even your wife.
[00:51:35.726 --> 00:51:36.086]  What?! !

[00:53:38.652 --> 00:53:41.774]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.

[00:54:04.627 --> 00:54:05.288]  Effective.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:15.504]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:54:15.504 --> 00:54:18.525]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:54:18.525 --> 00:54:29.030]  Alright, Owen Schroyer is riding shotgun with us and we need to celebrate the fact that we've been right about Obamacare doubling and tripling prices to screw you over.
[00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:33.152]  We should be celebrating the fact that Trump's been turning the economy around and killing globalist operations.
[00:54:34.158 --> 00:54:38.241]  That's why they keep saying he's a failure and has got nothing done, because it's the opposite.
[00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:59.276]  We should be celebrating the fact that we were absolutely on target about their plan to try to steal the election from Trump, then to try to steal the actual seating by the electors on January 6th of this year, and trying to stop his inauguration, and trying to block people getting into it, and saying nobody was there despite the fact that they showed footage before the gates were open.
[00:55:00.774 --> 00:55:01.355]  On and on and on.
[00:55:01.355 --> 00:55:06.384]  We should just keep hammering them as the enemy and the fraud and the stinking trash they are.
[00:55:07.523 --> 00:55:10.305]  And it's happening more and more with CNN being booed.
[00:55:10.305 --> 00:55:16.168]  I want to play a clip of this and then go to Owen Schroer, but this is CNN in an event being booed everywhere they go.
[00:55:16.168 --> 00:55:17.709]  They are anathema.
[00:55:17.709 --> 00:55:23.652]  They literally, in their own memos and their own behind-the-scenes videos, admit they're there to lie to you.
[00:55:23.652 --> 00:55:28.275]  They're there to absolutely take us to war with other Christian nations.
[00:55:28.275 --> 00:55:29.256]  They are trash.
[00:55:29.256 --> 00:55:31.017]  They chose to be parasites.
[00:55:31.017 --> 00:55:32.698]  They chose to be bad guys.
[00:55:32.698 --> 00:55:34.879]  So then they recruit more and more people like that
[00:55:36.883 --> 00:55:40.005]  Until it's just a cesspool.
[00:55:40.005 --> 00:55:41.446]  I was talking to a friend of mine about that.
[00:55:41.446 --> 00:55:43.247]  You know, the fact, take like the military.
[00:55:43.247 --> 00:55:45.949]  One unit will be really great, hard-working, smart people.
[00:55:45.949 --> 00:55:49.911]  You'll have another unit that's a bunch of folks that can't even, you know, tie their shoelaces.
[00:55:49.911 --> 00:55:54.934]  And it's because the bad people all get together over here and then basically take it easy.
[00:55:54.934 --> 00:55:57.576]  And the good people end up congealing over there.
[00:55:57.576 --> 00:55:59.677]  The globalists are trash.
[00:55:59.677 --> 00:56:04.841]  They literally hate you if you're smart, if you're good-looking, if you're successful, if you're a nice person.
[00:56:06.164 --> 00:56:07.505]  They're filth.
[00:56:07.505 --> 00:56:08.687]  They're bad people.
[00:56:08.687 --> 00:56:11.149]  They're mainly child molesters.
[00:56:11.149 --> 00:56:21.299]  And once you know that, and the Deputy Pope's getting busted, and all these others are getting, and Hastert, and all the rest of it, you understand, these are the type of people that don't just like to rape little kids.
[00:56:21.299 --> 00:56:22.680]  They like to strangle them to death.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.342]  They like to scare them before they kill them.
[00:56:24.342 --> 00:56:26.244]  They like them to beg for money in the little cages.
[00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:28.701]  And all this is coming down.
[00:56:28.701 --> 00:56:30.022]  You could kill me and kill Trump.
[00:56:30.022 --> 00:56:31.823]  You're not stopping Jack's squad.
[00:56:31.823 --> 00:56:40.906]  And if all these people like Brennan and folks, just as they go over to Saudi Arabia and, you know, get down on their knees in front of the king, we're going to beat you.
[00:56:40.906 --> 00:56:41.986]  You're already beaten.
[00:56:41.986 --> 00:56:44.787]  And I don't just say that rhetorically or for rhetoric.
[00:56:44.787 --> 00:56:45.427]  It's true.
[00:56:45.427 --> 00:56:46.628]  You beat yourself.
[00:56:46.628 --> 00:56:47.628]  You're filth.
[00:56:47.628 --> 00:56:51.369]  I understand why you crave power, because you're garbage.
[00:56:51.369 --> 00:56:52.610]  Here's CNN being identified.
[00:56:55.089 --> 00:57:07.600]  I'm here this evening to cut through the fake news filter and to speak straight to the American people.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:09.301]  Fake news.
[00:57:09.301 --> 00:57:10.983]  Fake, fake, fake news.
[00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:24.460]  That's all Trump's got to do is identify the enemy.
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:27.300]  They're fake, they're the enemy, and then get his agenda done.
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.521]  Let me tell you the bad news, I'm going to come back to that with Owen Schroer.
[00:57:30.521 --> 00:57:30.901]  Wait a second.
[00:57:30.901 --> 00:57:47.707]  I watched a lot of Fox News when I've been on vacation, and all their major shows, except for Hannity and a few others, bash the president now and go, he hadn't got anything done, that's okay, he says fake news, and it's all real backhanded, sideways attacks.
[00:57:47.707 --> 00:57:51.928]  It's 90% negative now, from a real slimy, Eddie Haskell-level way.
[00:57:52.867 --> 00:57:59.959]  We're going to come back and go over all this and play the martial law clip where the former head of the CIA calls for a military coup.
[00:57:59.959 --> 00:58:03.745]  Yeah, no, he's calling for the president to get shot in the head.
[00:58:03.745 --> 00:58:04.406]  That's what a coup is.
[00:58:05.509 --> 00:58:07.009]  Or, you know, thrown in prison.
[00:58:07.009 --> 00:58:08.790]  And, of course, you know what comes after that.
[00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:09.650]  They're going to end the free press.
[00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:12.191]  They're going to bring in web censorship.
[00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:14.311]  And, oh, here's the next big story.
[00:58:14.311 --> 00:58:16.592]  While they do that, they're not going to really let me be quoted.
[00:58:16.592 --> 00:58:19.332]  They're going to block us on Facebook, Google, Twitter, more and more.
[00:58:19.332 --> 00:58:29.255]  While they have all these shows like Homeland, a new Comedy Central show, you name it, admittedly, the character's based on me doing horrible things in my name, saying they're Alex Jones.
[00:58:30.177 --> 00:58:32.638]  So they don't just gag me or try to.
[00:58:32.638 --> 00:58:34.758]  They then go out and misrepresent what I say and do.
[00:58:34.758 --> 00:58:35.978]  That's what little cowards do.
[00:58:35.978 --> 00:58:36.979]  But guess what?
[00:58:36.979 --> 00:58:39.699]  Only the little servile cowards still believe you.
[00:58:39.699 --> 00:58:41.340]  So be happy with your company.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:43.580]  Let's read your hopes, your prayers, your support.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.260]  Spread the word.

[00:58:45.781 --> 00:58:47.381]  But whatever you do, be heard.
[00:58:47.381 --> 00:58:48.821]  Speak out now.

[00:59:11.721 --> 00:59:12.623]  Big waiting list.
[00:59:12.623 --> 00:59:16.468]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[00:59:16.468 --> 00:59:17.309]  Nobody's got something this great.
[00:59:17.609 --> 00:59:24.651]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 million live in each pill.

[00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:41.257]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:25.271 --> 01:00:34.967]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.967 --> 01:00:38.453]  Well, well, well.
[01:00:38.453 --> 01:00:39.494]  What are they gonna do now?
[01:00:41.474 --> 01:00:42.355]  When?
[01:00:42.355 --> 01:00:45.397]  They're openly calling for a military coup against the President.
[01:00:45.397 --> 01:00:47.358]  They're openly calling for a shutdown of the free press.
[01:00:47.358 --> 01:00:48.919]  They're openly calling for a takeover of the Internet.
[01:00:48.919 --> 01:00:54.703]  They're openly calling to get rid of our borders completely, or we're horrible, evil, racist, but nobody else gets rid of their borders.
[01:00:54.703 --> 01:00:58.766]  They're openly calling for an accelerated Muslim invasion.
[01:00:58.766 --> 01:01:02.909]  And they've got Homeland, Comedy Central shows, Tuck Buckford.
[01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:09.654]  They've got shows on Showtime, HBO, and movies coming out where people just start screaming
[01:01:10.925 --> 01:01:15.187]  All these horrible, horrible racist things and then saying, I learned it from Alex Jones.
[01:01:15.187 --> 01:01:19.809]  I mean, I won't even repeat the things they say.
[01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:22.590]  Because then they'll just take the clips out and edit it together.
[01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:26.892]  I saw an article on Friday out of Newsweek last Friday.
[01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:31.414]  By this spook lady and.
[01:01:31.414 --> 01:01:35.256]  Just a nobody, and she just had all these like two letter and three letter quotes.
[01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:38.843]  And then some of them weren't even quotes edited together.
[01:01:38.843 --> 01:01:47.990]  It just said, Jones is telling his listeners to go out and bleep more Democrats.
[01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:49.091]  And they're so deceptive.
[01:01:49.091 --> 01:01:53.534]  I mean, I should just be able to say my free speech that they said that, but I won't even say it because they'll edit that.
[01:01:53.534 --> 01:01:55.396]  I mean, they've gone all in.
[01:01:55.396 --> 01:01:57.778]  They are such scum.
[01:01:57.778 --> 01:02:01.801]  I mean, words don't describe what lying filth they are.
[01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:04.563]  And you read all these quotes, three-letter and two-letter quotes.
[01:02:06.688 --> 01:02:10.089]  And legally for themselves, they put quotes around them, and then they have more quotes.
[01:02:10.089 --> 01:02:10.790]  Let me tell you something.
[01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:17.052]  You see two or three words with quotes, and then the next words are quotes, and they're trying to make you read it like somebody said it?
[01:02:17.052 --> 01:02:18.152]  Like you're not literary?
[01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:20.473]  Like you don't know English?
[01:02:20.473 --> 01:02:21.774]  They're cobbling it together.
[01:02:21.774 --> 01:02:29.936]  Just like if I said, Jack went out and played golf with his dad, and boy, he killed it.
[01:02:29.936 --> 01:02:33.878]  You could edit that together to say, Jack went out and killed his dad while playing golf.
[01:02:36.974 --> 01:02:39.716]  That's what they did.
[01:02:39.716 --> 01:02:41.477]  I went back and looked at the shows they talked about.
[01:02:41.477 --> 01:02:43.279]  It's like, we don't want violence.
[01:02:43.279 --> 01:02:44.140]  They want a shooting war.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.641]  They killed two more cops this week.
[01:02:45.641 --> 01:02:46.722]  They're calling for more death.
[01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:50.004]  We need to hold our powder and keep waking people up politically.
[01:02:50.004 --> 01:02:50.645]  They're losing.
[01:02:50.645 --> 01:02:51.785]  We do not want to be violent.
[01:02:51.785 --> 01:02:52.966]  They want a civil war.
[01:02:52.966 --> 01:02:53.807]  Let's not give it to them.
[01:02:53.807 --> 01:02:54.407]  We're winning.
[01:02:54.407 --> 01:02:57.450]  That turns into, I want violence.
[01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:59.571]  Owen Schroeder, what do you make of the period we're at?
[01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:03.815]  Because our credibility is going straight up like an Atlas rocket.
[01:03:04.755 --> 01:03:05.977]  Well, theirs is going in the toilet.
[01:03:05.977 --> 01:03:08.440]  They admit they know they're not going to be able to get Congress.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:13.167]  They admit they can't get rid of Trump right now, so now they're saying, let's militarily overthrow him.
[01:03:13.167 --> 01:03:17.394]  Everybody needs to go along with this bipartisanly, and I guess hope that the coup group
[01:03:19.016 --> 01:03:19.756]  Stops at that.
[01:03:39.665 --> 01:03:43.147]  Well they have to attempt this coup because President Trump is willing to address real issues.
[01:04:03.101 --> 01:04:04.282]  Which Washington D.C.
[01:04:04.282 --> 01:04:06.905]  and the White House has been ignoring for years.
[01:04:06.905 --> 01:04:11.390]  Everybody freaking out about President Trump not wanting to put transgenders in the military.
[01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.193]  Well, that's a minor issue, okay?
[01:04:14.193 --> 01:04:18.077]  That's only a big issue to the Barack Obamas of Washington D.C.
[01:04:18.077 --> 01:04:23.764]  They're not giving their constituents anything real, so they give them taxpayer-paid for, you know, weenie chops.
[01:04:24.602 --> 01:04:44.397]  Well, and here's the other thing that's been so refreshing about Trump, why he's endeared himself to America, is because he's willing to say the things that have been considered politically incorrect in the past, because he's willing to say things that the Washington establishment is not willing to say, and it's time for Congress to take that same approach to their work, Alex.
[01:04:44.397 --> 01:04:49.621]  I mean, it's amazing the things that Congress just completely ignores on the Hill.
[01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:51.322]  It's really sickening, to be honest with you.
[01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:51.883]  Exactly!
[01:04:52.503 --> 01:04:53.144]  Exactly.
[01:04:53.144 --> 01:04:57.370]  And again, they want to all just act establishment and stuff suit.
[01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:59.974]  The Democrats are trying to organize a violent coup.
[01:04:59.974 --> 01:05:00.915]  Yes, it's crazy.
[01:05:00.915 --> 01:05:03.218]  It sounds nuts to talk about it, but it's happening.
[01:05:03.218 --> 01:05:04.600]  So we've got to address it.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:04.981]  Stay with us.
[01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:05.481]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:08.021 --> 01:05:19.566]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[01:05:19.566 --> 01:05:22.548]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[01:05:22.548 --> 01:05:31.112]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[01:05:31.112 --> 01:05:33.773]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[01:05:34.033 --> 01:05:42.159]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[01:05:42.159 --> 01:05:46.503]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[01:05:46.503 --> 01:05:51.427]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[01:05:51.427 --> 01:05:57.671]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[01:05:57.671 --> 01:05:59.853]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[01:05:59.853 --> 01:06:03.356]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort.
[01:06:03.496 --> 01:06:05.702]  When we should be demanding liberty.
[01:06:05.702 --> 01:06:07.708]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.383]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:06:13.383 --> 01:06:26.330]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:32.914]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:06:32.914 --> 01:06:35.375]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[01:06:35.435 --> 01:06:46.658]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:06:46.658 --> 01:06:48.999]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[01:06:48.999 --> 01:06:50.499]  We're getting results.
[01:06:50.499 --> 01:06:56.441]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:06:56.581 --> 01:06:59.482]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:07.066]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:18.711]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:07:18.931 --> 01:07:26.015]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:26.015 --> 01:07:30.898]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:30.898 --> 01:07:37.683]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:37.683 --> 01:07:44.667]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:44.847 --> 01:07:51.872]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:51.872 --> 01:07:56.354]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:56.354 --> 01:08:06.061]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:07.842]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:08.522 --> 01:08:11.843]  The world is a dangerous place.
[01:08:11.843 --> 01:08:16.985]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:08:16.985 --> 01:08:21.847]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:36.052 --> 01:08:52.405]  When you study the patterns of history and the signatures of renaissance versus the signatures of degradation, entropy and collapse, history does repeat it also rhymes, as it's been said by many a historian.
[01:08:54.110 --> 01:09:07.835]  And complacency and decadence is the number one hallmark of the most brutal collapses into the underworld or into the gold gothic
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:22.583]  Hades-like systems of the French Revolution, or Communist China, or Soviet Russia, or so-called socialist Venezuela today.
[01:09:22.583 --> 01:09:26.003]  Because it's not about what you produce and do, or what you stand for.
[01:09:26.003 --> 01:09:34.925]  It's about the fact that you are dishonorable, and will work in those dishonorable groups to engage in predatory activities against your fellow citizens.
[01:09:34.925 --> 01:09:37.946]  And we're sitting here, myself included, very complacent
[01:09:40.706 --> 01:09:43.028]  I should be calling Congress panicking.
[01:09:43.028 --> 01:09:45.130]  I should be running down the street handing out flyers.
[01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:50.574]  I should have aircraft flying saying, coup against the President planned.
[01:09:50.574 --> 01:10:02.384]  But instead I'm like, yeah, they're planning a coup and all these publications and the former Deputy Defense Secretary in the news making the rounds, making the case for a military intervention against the President.
[01:10:02.384 --> 01:10:05.046]  I told you about that before it was in the news.
[01:10:05.046 --> 01:10:07.408]  Then it was in the major publications.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:33.056]  That they're planning a COG overthrow of the President, and now they've got the Aspen Institute, a high-level, kind of Bilderberg public event, Davos, you know, type of event out West in Colorado, with Clapper, the former head of National Security, that's over the 17 agencies, and then you've got the former head of the CIA, who told the President better watch his mouth,
[01:10:34.733 --> 01:10:38.174]  Running around saying, oh, it's very reasonable, bipartisan.
[01:10:38.174 --> 01:10:41.135]  It's just like you change a tire on your car.
[01:10:41.135 --> 01:10:44.116]  You'll pay your bills or wipe your nose or brush your teeth in the morning.
[01:10:44.116 --> 01:10:45.576]  It's very routine.
[01:10:45.576 --> 01:10:55.479]  We need to just remove the president with a coup if he removes Mueller, who's on the biggest fishing expedition of his life, of our lives.
[01:10:56.974 --> 01:11:03.777]  With all these Democrats, two of them which Trump fired, they give 99.8% of their money to Hillary.
[01:11:03.777 --> 01:11:06.498]  That's all over the news.
[01:11:06.498 --> 01:11:25.786]  And now it's to his whole family, all his businesses, all of the people in his campaign, they're using illegal NSA data to take non-events, like them looking for dirt on Hillary, and they're making these big, huge, evil things, or Senator Sessions talking to the Russian ambassador a few times, which he admitted to.
[01:11:27.639 --> 01:11:32.180]  Which he's supposed to do on the Foreign Relations Committee.
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:33.700]  Pelosi said, I've never met with him.
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:39.882]  It turns out she met with him 30 plus times, photographed with him more than 10 times in the same year, 2016.
[01:11:39.882 --> 01:11:46.603]  Everybody knows it's the Russians have been up the Democrats' behinds.
[01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:48.663]  It's not the Republicans.
[01:11:48.663 --> 01:11:56.125]  And it is kind of payback from the Democrats from 50 years ago when the Republicans went after them for being in bed with the Russians when they were communists.
[01:11:57.782 --> 01:12:03.067]  So it's just absolutely wild to see this going on.
[01:12:03.067 --> 01:12:14.857]  And now you've got Brennan, former CIA director, at a meeting with Clapper nodding his head in agreeing with Wolf Blitzer.
[01:12:18.564 --> 01:12:24.928]  Sitting there, who's a foreign intelligence operative, he admittedly worked for Israeli intelligence.
[01:12:24.928 --> 01:12:26.088]  You think he still doesn't do it?
[01:12:26.088 --> 01:12:27.349]  I'm not against Israel!
[01:12:27.349 --> 01:12:37.455]  But imagine if Israeli TV hosts were CIA, and everybody knew it, and you're not supposed to talk about it, because you're bashing Americans, if you go, oh, that guy's a CIA guy.
[01:12:37.455 --> 01:12:47.581]  It's just what we put up with, with the Pope in our business, and the Saudi Arabians, and the CHICOMs, and the EU, and the bureaucrats, and like, get out of our lives, New World Order!
[01:12:48.854 --> 01:12:50.336]  So all of this is now happening.
[01:12:50.336 --> 01:12:51.458]  This is all admitted.
[01:12:51.458 --> 01:12:53.140]  What do we do to raise the alarm?
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.303]  What do we do to get attention?
[01:12:55.303 --> 01:12:57.586]  I'm going to tell the business owners something.
[01:12:57.586 --> 01:13:00.110]  We have a lot of great AM and FM affiliates that pick up our broadcast.
[01:13:01.428 --> 01:13:05.049]  And it gets writings, but a lot of the big sponsors obviously are scared.
[01:13:05.049 --> 01:13:08.151]  If you keep continuing to be scared, we're going to lose everything.
[01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:11.532]  We got here because of people being scared and being politically correct.
[01:13:11.532 --> 01:13:20.855]  And they can always move the goalpost and make political correctness more and more and more until you can't use the words mother and father on entrance papers for your kids.
[01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:24.457]  Your kids call themselves purple penguins and don't call themselves he or she's.
[01:13:24.457 --> 01:13:28.558]  You allow cult-like brainwashing to go on because you don't want to hurt any feelings.
[01:13:28.558 --> 01:13:29.739]  You want to go home and watch TV.
[01:13:32.261 --> 01:13:34.322]  You want to go home and plug yourself into the Matrix?
[01:13:34.322 --> 01:13:36.583]  Why do you even have kids?
[01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:40.746]  We need people to get aggressive in the face of this, and we need folks to...
[01:13:42.455 --> 01:13:45.816]  If you're business owners, don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[01:13:45.816 --> 01:13:50.919]  You should be putting billboards up everywhere about the plan to have a coup against Trump.
[01:13:50.919 --> 01:13:52.259]  The plan to overthrow America.
[01:13:52.259 --> 01:13:53.640]  The plan to take our guns.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.140]  The plan.
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.180]  We're kicking their butt.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:14:03.324]  That's going to cause them to have an all-or-nothing, battle-of-the-bulge attack, a counterattack on us that you're now seeing them organize.
[01:14:03.324 --> 01:14:06.905]  And so, you notice Newsweek said, I'm calling for a violent coup.
[01:14:06.905 --> 01:14:07.765]  I want a civil war.
[01:14:07.765 --> 01:14:09.506]  No, I said they want a violent coup.
[01:14:09.506 --> 01:14:10.427]  They want a civil war.
[01:14:12.725 --> 01:14:19.767]  His Justice Department must move against the criminal preparations that are totally illegal according to so many federal laws.
[01:14:19.767 --> 01:14:21.548]  It makes my head spin.
[01:14:21.548 --> 01:14:23.589]  To overthrow an elected president.
[01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:25.469]  To try to shut down the press.
[01:14:25.469 --> 01:14:29.971]  To have the CIA admittedly in Congress saying they want to shut down the independent media.
[01:14:29.971 --> 01:14:39.634]  All of this is illegal, and all of it's out of control, and the Russian and Chinese ties of the Democrats, and the illegal servers, and the stealing the Haitian money, and the 12 million she got in Morocco from the King.
[01:14:41.124 --> 01:14:46.108]  We have to move against them on every front, politically exposing them as the criminals.
[01:14:46.108 --> 01:14:50.472]  They're trying to normalize military coup right now to try to do it.
[01:14:50.472 --> 01:14:53.354]  Try to get their people to follow the order to do it.
[01:14:53.354 --> 01:14:57.778]  Guaranteed, they've already been given orders to try to get a coup going in these rogue agencies.
[01:14:57.778 --> 01:14:59.800]  It had to happen.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.881]  But they're trying to organize it.
[01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:02.482]  They're trying to work with outside groups.
[01:15:02.482 --> 01:15:05.445]  And we're so wide open, ladies and gentlemen, they might get away with it.
[01:15:06.874 --> 01:15:09.676]  So I'm here to tell you, Trump needs to come out and address the nation.
[01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:11.377]  He needs to point this out.
[01:15:11.377 --> 01:15:13.618]  And then we need to see indictments of these people.
[01:15:13.618 --> 01:15:22.343]  We need to see Brennan and Clapper indicted for sedition, indicted for treason, indicted for multinational espionage.
[01:15:22.343 --> 01:15:26.866]  This corporate fraud is so big, they come in and take over your whole government.
[01:15:26.866 --> 01:15:32.429]  And then try to get rid of your free press, get rid of your president, then you keep selling the country out.
[01:15:32.429 --> 01:15:32.790]  So again,
[01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:40.550]  We need everybody to understand this is hardcore, this is real, this is happening, and the danger is not spreading the word.
[01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:56.374]  They want to just calmly start talking about, yeah, the cops deserve to get shot, yeah, we need to burn down the cities, you know, yeah, we need to, you know, kill some of these governors, yeah, Trump needs to die, we need to have the military overthrow him, yeah, you know, he's a Russian, yeah.
[01:15:57.094 --> 01:16:06.598]  It's time for us bipartisanly to just kind of, it's no big deal, hey, everybody be calm when this happens and we don't want the country torn apart.
[01:16:06.598 --> 01:16:19.804]  They're trying to get the talking points out for when they drop a 2,000 pound bomb on Trump, turn the air defenses off and have one of their crazies, they've already got picked out, go in there.
[01:16:19.804 --> 01:16:22.325]  I'm telling you folks, the sky's the limit.
[01:16:22.325 --> 01:16:26.447]  I bet they got pilots ready to get in Warthogs right now, somewhere in Virginia.
[01:16:28.524 --> 01:16:29.925]  You understand?
[01:16:29.925 --> 01:16:31.286]  The president needs to go in a bunker.
[01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:33.068]  He needs to declare this is going on.
[01:16:33.068 --> 01:16:34.449]  We're already in a civil war.
[01:16:34.449 --> 01:16:35.130]  They admit it.
[01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:37.812]  And here's Clapper.
[01:16:37.812 --> 01:16:41.115]  And here's Brennan on the stage calling for coup.
[01:16:41.115 --> 01:16:42.276]  Here it is.
[01:16:42.276 --> 01:16:50.704]  But this is where the work of Robert Mueller is critical to our future as a country because I, you know, in some respects we're a government and a nation in crisis right now.
[01:16:51.812 --> 01:16:54.314]  You have confidence in this special counsel?
[01:16:54.314 --> 01:16:55.334]  Absolutely.
[01:16:55.334 --> 01:16:57.696]  You both worked with him for a long time when he was head of the FBI.
[01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:58.136]  Absolutely.
[01:16:58.136 --> 01:17:00.277]  It was an inspired choice.
[01:17:00.277 --> 01:17:02.059]  They don't come any better.
[01:17:02.059 --> 01:17:07.882]  Nobody better than Bob Mueller, who is a straight shooter and will not be intimidated by anything.
[01:17:07.882 --> 01:17:16.448]  And if he's fired by Mr. Trump, or is tempted to be fired by Mr. Trump, I hope, I really hope that our members of Congress, our elected representatives, are going to stand up and say enough is enough.
[01:17:17.128 --> 01:17:24.396]  And stop making apologies and excuses for things that are happening that really flout, I think, our system of laws and government here.
[01:17:24.396 --> 01:17:28.881]  When you say enough is enough, what will... Enough is enough.
[01:17:28.881 --> 01:17:34.588]  If he's fired, and he's the President of the United States, he could tell Rosenstein to fire him if he wants.
[01:17:34.588 --> 01:17:37.271]  But if he's fired, what would you want Congress to do?
[01:17:38.476 --> 01:17:48.340]  Well, first of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders that, again, are inconsistent with what this country is all about.
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:18:01.746]  But I would just hope that this is not going to be a partisan issue, that Republicans and Democrats are going to see that the future of this country is at stake, and there needs to be some things done for the good of the future.
[01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:15.717]  So he wants an executive branch coup, and he's saying we've got McCain, we've got other people on board, the Republican leadership, to then call out the Freedom Caucus and the American Restoration Groups.
[01:18:15.717 --> 01:18:20.739]  And notice, he tries to sell it like it's a good thing.
[01:18:20.739 --> 01:18:26.021]  They're the ones illegally spying on the Trump campaign, and illegally fixing the polls, and illegally fixing
[01:18:27.253 --> 01:18:29.633]  The questions for Hillary, they've all been caught.
[01:18:29.633 --> 01:18:30.514]  They're discredited.
[01:18:30.514 --> 01:18:33.814]  They have no evidence of this made-up Russia crap.
[01:18:33.814 --> 01:18:35.514]  Other than Trump's trying to find dirt on Hillary.
[01:18:35.514 --> 01:18:36.135]  Good.
[01:18:36.135 --> 01:18:37.715]  That's what we need.
[01:18:37.715 --> 01:18:40.295]  Trump said, give us the WikiLeaks emails if you got them.
[01:18:40.295 --> 01:18:42.256]  He said that on the stage.
[01:18:42.256 --> 01:18:43.756]  He's not hiding it.
[01:18:43.756 --> 01:18:46.476]  When we come back, Owen Schroer's riding shotgun with us.
[01:18:46.476 --> 01:18:49.897]  I want to open the phones up as well, but this is a big deal.
[01:18:49.897 --> 01:18:52.818]  Please don't forget, we need your support and prayers now more than ever.
[01:18:52.818 --> 01:18:55.038]  Thank you for standing with us in this battle for the Republic.
[01:18:56.089 --> 01:18:57.049]  We have the initiative.
[01:18:57.049 --> 01:18:59.010]  We have the moral high ground.
[01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:00.410]  We're beginning to win.
[01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:01.871]  But the enemy is now counter-striking.
[01:19:01.871 --> 01:19:03.431]  We need your prayers today.
[01:19:03.431 --> 01:19:05.272]  The President needs your prayers around the clock.
[01:19:05.272 --> 01:19:07.072]  Please, lift us up in prayer.
[01:19:07.072 --> 01:19:07.812]  We don't believe in it.
[01:19:07.812 --> 01:19:08.553]  We depend on it.
[01:19:08.553 --> 01:19:09.833]  We know it.
[01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:10.773]  It's beyond believing it.
[01:19:10.773 --> 01:19:11.853]  We know it!
[01:19:11.853 --> 01:19:12.674]  It's in my bones.
[01:19:12.674 --> 01:19:13.294]  It's in my gut.
[01:19:14.401 --> 01:19:16.142]  And we also have big sales.
[01:19:16.142 --> 01:19:18.923]  These are the biggest sales ever of Super Female Vitality.
[01:19:18.923 --> 01:19:20.244]  I just wanted to do it.
[01:19:20.244 --> 01:19:21.705]  57% off.
[01:19:21.705 --> 01:19:23.246]  So that is a lost leader.
[01:19:23.246 --> 01:19:25.127]  Almost a lost leader.
[01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:26.407]  Super Male is about to be sold out.
[01:19:26.407 --> 01:19:27.628]  It's specials over.
[01:19:27.628 --> 01:19:29.109]  It's at regular full price with Super Female.
[01:19:29.369 --> 01:19:30.770]  Works great for men as well.
[01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:31.912]  Women, you really should try it.
[01:19:31.912 --> 01:19:34.174]  Libido, stamina, energy.

[01:22:06.095 --> 01:22:10.556]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:22:10.556 --> 01:22:12.137]  Those times may be near.
[01:22:12.137 --> 01:22:13.037]  Think about it.
[01:22:13.037 --> 01:22:17.659]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:22:17.659 --> 01:22:22.300]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:28.465]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:22:28.465 --> 01:22:35.170]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:37.712]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:22:38.152 --> 01:22:40.953]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:23:41.747 --> 01:23:42.827]  Forget bunkers.

[01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:46.368]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:24:18.977 --> 01:24:22.639]  These are the times that try men and women's souls, my friend.
[01:24:22.639 --> 01:24:25.360]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.161]  We are at a historic crossroads.
[01:24:27.161 --> 01:24:48.011]  The Democratic Party is openly calling for martial law, a shutdown of free press, and the former CIA Director Brennan on a stage with Wolf Blitzer and, of course, the former head of national intelligence as well, calling for a coup against President
[01:24:49.332 --> 01:24:50.913]  Trump.
[01:24:50.913 --> 01:24:55.136]  President Trump must go public about this.
[01:24:55.136 --> 01:25:02.221]  President Trump must, via the Justice Department, move against incredible criminal activity like this.
[01:25:02.221 --> 01:25:12.028]  Now, they're also spinning this, trying to say, oh, if he removes Mueller, then we have a right to do this.
[01:25:12.028 --> 01:25:12.789]  No, the President
[01:25:14.417 --> 01:25:15.517]  Has the right to do that.
[01:25:15.517 --> 01:25:18.358]  If Congress wants to try to impeach him, they can.
[01:25:18.358 --> 01:25:19.678]  It's the separation of powers.
[01:25:19.678 --> 01:25:43.223]  But the bureaucracy, Democrats that have appointed FBI directors, law firms that are giving themselves tens of millions of dollars to run this witch hunt, where 99.8% of the people that are donating money to political parties are giving it to the Democrats and Hillary in Mueller's law firm.
[01:25:44.206 --> 01:25:45.706]  Total conflict of interest.
[01:25:45.706 --> 01:25:56.189]  Two of the people on this new witch hunt, special investigators, special counsel group, were fired by Trump.
[01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:57.710]  Working for the federal government as U.S.
[01:25:57.710 --> 01:25:58.430]  attorneys.
[01:25:58.430 --> 01:26:00.971]  This is a joke.
[01:26:00.971 --> 01:26:01.711]  This is a joke.
[01:26:01.711 --> 01:26:08.113]  Again, it's like a man divorcing his wife and he's the judge, the family law judge, that sits on his own case.
[01:26:09.571 --> 01:26:11.111]  And Trump's going, what are you doing?
[01:26:11.111 --> 01:26:20.254]  Now they've expanded it to all his finances, all his companies, all his family, all his associates, everybody in his campaign to try to find something.
[01:26:20.254 --> 01:26:22.934]  And they're using illegal spying to get it.
[01:26:22.934 --> 01:26:24.695]  It's so un-American.
[01:26:24.695 --> 01:26:28.516]  President Trump must move against the globalists.
[01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:36.478]  President Trump constitutionally must expose this to the public and then have an attorney general that will execute the Constitution faithfully.
[01:26:38.021 --> 01:26:47.324]  And we'll go after a multinational coup of private interest and bureaucrats who think they're going to publicly organize a military coup.
[01:26:47.324 --> 01:26:49.485]  That's the killing of the president.
[01:26:49.485 --> 01:26:52.686]  Is the president supposed to just sit there and wait till they kill him?
[01:26:52.686 --> 01:26:53.886]  That's the question I'm asking.
[01:26:55.222 --> 01:26:59.666]  Is he just going to sit there while they organize a violent overthrow and the shutdown of the free press?
[01:26:59.666 --> 01:27:01.807]  Are we going to sit here and take it?
[01:27:01.807 --> 01:27:14.217]  We've got to do what Pastor Rodney Howard Brown from South Africa, who's been on before, by the way, and who has a huge ministry and is a major evangelical who's friends with Trump and led that prayer meeting two weeks ago with Trump.
[01:27:14.217 --> 01:27:19.481]  He met with a senior Republican congressman who said the plan for violent overthrow is imminent.
[01:27:19.481 --> 01:27:21.062]  They're organizing it now.
[01:27:21.062 --> 01:27:24.285]  Well, hell, you just saw earlier, I played the clip, Brennan.
[01:27:26.710 --> 01:27:34.776]  Up there with Clapper on TV saying we're organizing a bipartisan overthrow of the President.
[01:27:34.776 --> 01:27:38.139]  He said we're taking action, we're moving in this direction.
[01:27:38.139 --> 01:27:40.580]  We're taking the steps.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.001]  You go, why would they tell you about a coup?
[01:27:42.001 --> 01:27:45.024]  They've got to get everybody sold on it in the bureaucracy.
[01:27:45.024 --> 01:27:50.488]  That's what's letting you know they took the safety off, they got the switches ready, they're turning the nuclear keys.
[01:27:54.096 --> 01:27:56.077]  You think we can all just sit here and put up with this?
[01:27:56.077 --> 01:27:58.658]  You think you're going to be safe with these people?
[01:27:58.658 --> 01:28:00.919]  You think they're just going to stop there?
[01:28:00.919 --> 01:28:02.459]  They're going to loot everything.
[01:28:02.459 --> 01:28:03.160]  They're monsters.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.141]  And they're trying to tell Republicans, go along with this, we'll leave you in power.
[01:28:07.141 --> 01:28:08.922]  They're not going to leave anybody in power.
[01:28:08.922 --> 01:28:12.984]  They want a one-party system because they've been rejected.
[01:28:12.984 --> 01:28:15.605]  And they admit that's what they want.
[01:28:15.605 --> 01:28:18.286]  Owen Schroer, how epic is this moment we're facing?
[01:28:18.286 --> 01:28:20.707]  And what do you think the President should do specifically?
[01:28:21.107 --> 01:28:24.311]  Well, earlier you were saying, what do we do to raise the alarm?
[01:28:24.311 --> 01:28:28.916]  How do we get the American public to realize what's going on?
[01:28:28.916 --> 01:28:34.903]  And I think that President Trump has realized that now he needs an Attorney General that's going to do that.
[01:28:34.903 --> 01:28:37.186]  He needs an Attorney General that's going to be vocal.
[01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:43.948]  He needs an attorney general that's going to come out and say, hey, look at all these violent Democrats calling for a coup against Trump.
[01:28:43.948 --> 01:28:47.169]  Look at Bernie Sanders calling the Republicans an extremist party.
[01:28:47.169 --> 01:28:51.210]  And then Steve Scalise and four other people get shot at a baseball practice.
[01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:54.110]  Look at them saying openly they want a coup against Trump.
[01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:59.452]  Look at them saying openly they don't want to engage with Trump in making America great again.
[01:29:00.232 --> 01:29:01.153]  He's not getting that.
[01:29:01.153 --> 01:29:02.354]  Nobody's saying that for him.
[01:29:02.354 --> 01:29:07.137]  He's not getting that public support from anyone in Congress, from anyone in his administration.
[01:29:07.137 --> 01:29:10.799]  He's got Scaramucci now that seems to be doing it this week, coming out.
[01:29:10.799 --> 01:29:16.143]  But I think that that's what Trump needs to do right now to try to get that into the mainstream.
[01:29:16.143 --> 01:29:17.004]  Get that rhetoric.
[01:29:17.004 --> 01:29:18.385]  Get what you're talking about out there.
[01:29:19.285 --> 01:29:20.726]  Infowars is his main support base.
[01:29:20.726 --> 01:29:22.228]  They know that's why they're attacking us.
[01:29:22.228 --> 01:29:23.088]  It's the American people.
[01:29:23.088 --> 01:29:24.029]  We're not scared.
[01:29:24.029 --> 01:29:25.390]  We're not going to be slaves to the globalists.
[01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:26.131]  We're done.
[01:29:26.131 --> 01:29:29.774]  But all those cowards in Washington are trying to hedge their bets.
[01:29:29.774 --> 01:29:33.957]  And he's just got to get real people around him that aren't playing ball with the globalists.
[01:29:33.957 --> 01:29:36.699]  Because look, I'd compromise to get the country going.
[01:29:36.699 --> 01:29:37.620]  They're not going to compromise.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.562]  They're never going to stop.
[01:29:40.562 --> 01:29:43.284]  Scaramucci says he's going to fire everybody that leaks.
[01:29:43.284 --> 01:29:46.407]  So I think Trump needs to fire anybody who's not willing to get behind him 100%.
[01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:48.370]  That's right.
[01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:51.533]  I want to talk specifically to military, law enforcement, and others.
[01:29:51.533 --> 01:29:53.996]  People in other countries that have lived under coups, you name it.
[01:29:53.996 --> 01:29:54.676]  When we come back, 800-259-9231.
[01:29:54.676 --> 01:29:55.257]  First time callers.
[01:29:55.257 --> 01:29:55.317]  800-259-9231.
[01:29:55.317 --> 01:29:56.598]  I'll give the number when we come back.
[01:29:56.598 --> 01:29:58.860]  We're going to take calls on this subject.
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:29:59.961]  Got a bunch of clips too.
[01:30:08.493 --> 01:30:19.455]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:30:19.455 --> 01:30:26.496]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:30:26.496 --> 01:30:35.638]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[01:30:37.288 --> 01:30:39.089]  Independence isn't a day.
[01:30:39.089 --> 01:30:40.129]  It's a mindset.
[01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:42.890]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:44.490]  I will not be your slave.
[01:30:44.490 --> 01:30:50.572]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[01:30:50.572 --> 01:30:55.513]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:30:55.513 --> 01:30:57.413]  Slaves are never safe.
[01:30:57.413 --> 01:31:00.394]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:31:00.394 --> 01:31:01.495]  Guard your liberty.
[01:31:01.495 --> 01:31:04.855]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:31:04.855 --> 01:31:06.736]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[01:32:09.412 --> 01:32:13.195]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:32:13.195 --> 01:32:20.920]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:29.525]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:32:29.525 --> 01:32:33.968]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:32:33.968 --> 01:32:39.292]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:32:39.552 --> 01:32:43.773]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:32:43.773 --> 01:32:47.193]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:32:47.193 --> 01:32:58.335]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:32:58.335 --> 01:33:01.236]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:33:01.236 --> 01:33:07.217]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at Infowarslife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:13.141]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[01:33:13.141 --> 01:33:14.361]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.361 --> 01:33:15.362]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.362 --> 01:33:16.262]  From InfoWars.
[01:33:16.262 --> 01:33:16.982]  InfoWars.
[01:33:16.982 --> 01:33:17.302]  Yeah.
[01:33:17.302 --> 01:33:18.063]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.063 --> 01:33:18.903]  Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.903 --> 01:33:22.384]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[01:33:22.384 --> 01:33:25.245]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[01:33:25.245 --> 01:33:29.966]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:33:30.046 --> 01:33:31.727]  It's the conspiracy du jour.
[01:33:31.727 --> 01:33:34.949]  Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[01:33:34.949 --> 01:33:37.690]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:40.072]  I've already got Alex Jones, so I know the truth!
[01:33:40.072 --> 01:33:40.412]  Mine too!
[01:33:40.412 --> 01:33:49.697]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[01:33:49.697 --> 01:33:51.438]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:33:51.438 --> 01:33:53.699]  And this really, this is so disgusting.
[01:33:53.699 --> 01:33:56.241]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[01:33:59.887 --> 01:34:02.648]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[01:34:02.648 --> 01:34:05.749]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[01:34:05.749 --> 01:34:11.951]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[01:34:11.951 --> 01:34:14.151]  If Trump gets elected, he's gonna be Secretary of Defense.
[01:34:14.151 --> 01:34:16.072]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[01:34:16.072 --> 01:34:17.492]  Move, bitch!
[01:34:17.492 --> 01:34:18.413]  Get out the way!
[01:34:18.413 --> 01:34:21.013]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[01:34:21.013 --> 01:34:22.534]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[01:34:23.755 --> 01:34:25.076]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:34:25.076 --> 01:34:26.117]  Infowars.com.
[01:34:26.117 --> 01:34:27.218]  Infowars.com.
[01:34:27.218 --> 01:34:28.219]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:34:28.219 --> 01:34:33.905]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[01:34:33.905 --> 01:34:38.450]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:40.031]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:43.806 --> 01:34:50.372]  All right, so here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office.
[01:34:50.372 --> 01:34:51.352]  It's that serious.
[01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:52.934]  This is not a diversionary tactic.
[01:34:52.934 --> 01:34:53.955]  This stuff is real here.
[01:34:53.955 --> 01:34:57.778]  This coup, this silent coup that is taking place is real.
[01:34:57.778 --> 01:35:09.308]  A soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[01:35:09.828 --> 01:35:16.053]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[01:35:16.053 --> 01:35:22.278]  I got to go into the Congress and spend three hours from 9.30 in the evening to 12.30 a.m.
[01:35:22.278 --> 01:35:26.041]  with one of the senior ranking members of Congress.
[01:35:26.041 --> 01:35:32.807]  And he told me, and of course this is what I said on CBN but they cut it out, but I'm going to go public with this because we have to.
[01:35:32.807 --> 01:35:34.908]  He said there is a plot on Capitol Hill
[01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:46.562]  This is an effort to subvert the administration of President Donald Trump.
[01:35:46.562 --> 01:35:47.804]  It is nothing less.
[01:35:47.804 --> 01:35:53.992]  It is an effort by the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and a legitimate government.
[01:35:54.592 --> 01:35:57.275]  And to break the will of the American people.
[01:36:09.889 --> 01:36:15.612]  And the best description of it is by Barry Kesselman in his blog where he said this is a coup d'etat.
[01:36:15.612 --> 01:36:20.294]  He said 14 million citizens in private ballots picked Donald Trump.
[01:36:20.294 --> 01:36:22.495]  20 TV executives have decided to destroy him.
[01:36:22.495 --> 01:36:28.277]  This is no longer about Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.
[01:36:28.277 --> 01:36:38.662]  This is about a full-on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump.
[01:36:43.144 --> 01:36:46.287]  Now, I'm going to play for you.
[01:36:46.287 --> 01:36:48.648]  That's the last few months.
[01:36:48.648 --> 01:36:59.697]  Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, a senior pastor, Trump's pastor basically, meeting at the White House with a senior member of Congress.
[01:36:59.697 --> 01:37:01.518]  This is just last week.
[01:37:01.518 --> 01:37:03.860]  Breaking this week.
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.742]  And CBN is afraid to run it.
[01:37:06.742 --> 01:37:07.943]  And I understand.
[01:37:07.943 --> 01:37:12.627]  This is real.
[01:37:14.554 --> 01:37:20.761]  And you have to understand, they're in publications that government reads trying to get it ready.
[01:37:20.761 --> 01:37:22.643]  And again, they're not just going to kill Trump.
[01:37:22.643 --> 01:37:25.046]  And believe me, they're going to kill him if they try.
[01:37:25.046 --> 01:37:30.111]  They're not going to let him haul him before a court in chains, turn him into a superhero.
[01:37:30.111 --> 01:37:34.476]  He's going to be a big enough martyr already.
[01:37:35.708 --> 01:37:40.730]  They're going to try to politically destroy him, then kill him, then bring out horrible lies about him so he can't defend himself.
[01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:43.071]  And they're going to go after all the opposition.
[01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:45.152]  You notice Ron Paul's starting to back Trump.
[01:37:45.152 --> 01:37:46.733]  He knows how much trouble Trump's in.
[01:37:46.733 --> 01:37:48.554]  He says, quote, Trump's back's against the wall.
[01:37:48.554 --> 01:37:49.534]  He was on last week.
[01:37:49.534 --> 01:37:51.315]  He said he's doing a good job.
[01:37:51.315 --> 01:37:52.456]  Rand Paul says he gets up.
[01:37:52.456 --> 01:37:53.896]  In fact, I never played that clip last week.
[01:37:53.896 --> 01:37:54.917]  Can we pull that up?
[01:37:54.917 --> 01:38:00.399]  He wakes up every morning and thanks God Donald Trump is president or we'd already be in giant wars.
[01:38:00.399 --> 01:38:03.161]  That's a fact.
[01:38:03.161 --> 01:38:03.801]  That's Rand Paul.
[01:38:05.223 --> 01:38:06.404]  Those are good guys.
[01:38:06.404 --> 01:38:07.684]  They understand.
[01:38:07.684 --> 01:38:10.906]  Now, you notice the Pauls now weren't supporting Trump?
[01:38:10.906 --> 01:38:17.108]  Now they are because they understand, folks, he's the figurehead and they're putting everything they can to take him down.
[01:38:17.108 --> 01:38:23.331]  If they get Trump, if they get Trump, they're going to get Ron Paul.
[01:38:23.331 --> 01:38:24.392]  They're going to get Rand Paul.
[01:38:24.392 --> 01:38:25.492]  They're going to get me.
[01:38:25.492 --> 01:38:26.553]  They're going to get Matt Drudge.
[01:38:26.553 --> 01:38:28.033]  They're going to get Sean Hannity.
[01:38:28.033 --> 01:38:29.174]  They're going to get Rush Limbaugh.
[01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:31.610]  Now is Rush Limbaugh perfect?
[01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:32.171]  No.
[01:38:32.171 --> 01:38:32.911]  Is Hannity perfect?
[01:38:32.911 --> 01:38:33.011]  No.
[01:38:33.011 --> 01:38:33.571]  Am I perfect?
[01:38:33.571 --> 01:38:34.291]  No.
[01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:36.012]  We're not out to get the country.
[01:38:36.012 --> 01:38:37.272]  We believe in prosperity.
[01:38:37.272 --> 01:38:39.873]  We believe in open religious freedom.
[01:38:39.873 --> 01:38:41.253]  We're Christians.
[01:38:41.253 --> 01:38:43.374]  We believe in America.
[01:38:43.374 --> 01:38:45.494]  We're not selling out to radical Islam.
[01:38:45.494 --> 01:38:47.495]  We're not trying to sexualize kids.
[01:38:47.495 --> 01:38:49.855]  We're just decent people.
[01:38:49.855 --> 01:38:51.856]  Does that mean Republicans don't walk the deep end sometimes?
[01:38:51.856 --> 01:38:52.356]  Absolutely.
[01:38:53.305 --> 01:38:55.126]  Does it mean the Republican establishment's horrible?
[01:38:55.126 --> 01:38:55.966]  Absolutely.
[01:38:55.966 --> 01:38:57.426]  Did it mean Limbaugh's been too easy on them?
[01:38:57.426 --> 01:38:58.307]  Yes.
[01:38:58.307 --> 01:38:59.947]  But all that's over, folks.
[01:38:59.947 --> 01:39:02.908]  The Republican establishment knows their days are numbered, too.
[01:39:02.908 --> 01:39:06.629]  That's why they're combined in this evil combination.
[01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:14.251]  This trifecta of MSM, foreign corporations, and the political class in this country that want to stay in control.
[01:39:14.251 --> 01:39:15.832]  And you've got this evil combination.
[01:39:15.832 --> 01:39:18.072]  That's what it is.
[01:39:18.072 --> 01:39:20.193]  Like a legion of doom.
[01:39:20.193 --> 01:39:22.794]  And then all their minions that are their useful idiots
[01:39:24.377 --> 01:39:25.737]  We're totally invested in the system.
[01:39:25.737 --> 01:39:29.699]  I'm going to play Brennan again here in a moment, but first I'm going to play Rand Paul.
[01:39:29.699 --> 01:39:34.360]  But here they are, confirming everything we've said.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:36.041]  And I don't keep saying every segment.
[01:39:36.041 --> 01:39:38.442]  See, I was right again.
[01:39:38.442 --> 01:39:44.123]  I'm explaining they're after me because I've read over a thousand history books.
[01:39:44.123 --> 01:39:45.844]  I used to stay up till 2, 3 in the morning almost every...
[01:39:49.435 --> 01:39:57.739]  ...books from ancient Greece and Rome and World War II and World War I and by learning history I learned how statecraft worked.
[01:39:57.739 --> 01:39:59.300]  I learned about court intrigue.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.001]  I learned about secret societies.
[01:40:02.001 --> 01:40:02.982]  I learned about COG.
[01:40:04.895 --> 01:40:05.735]  I'm not bragging.
[01:40:05.735 --> 01:40:08.476]  I was just the type that would watch C-SPAN when I was in high school and college.
[01:40:08.476 --> 01:40:12.678]  I'm the type of weirdo that would, you know, watch the re-airing on PBS of Watergate hearings.
[01:40:12.678 --> 01:40:21.801]  I'm the type of guy that would watch Frontline, back when it was a good show about COG and plans they had to have martial law back in the 80s.
[01:40:21.801 --> 01:40:26.863]  They didn't go there, but now I'm seeing what they had planned then.
[01:40:26.863 --> 01:40:28.304]  They're crazy enough to try it.
[01:40:28.304 --> 01:40:31.185]  They didn't try it before because there was a good chance they'd end up going to prison.
[01:40:33.595 --> 01:40:35.556]  The globalists are more wild now.
[01:40:35.556 --> 01:40:40.999]  They're not really the old guard that actually got power for themselves, that actually ran things.
[01:40:40.999 --> 01:40:48.482]  They were bad, but at least they worked 18 hours a day and had some restraint.
[01:40:48.482 --> 01:40:51.024]  You look at the people running things now.
[01:40:51.024 --> 01:40:52.344]  They thought they were going to beat Trump.
[01:40:52.344 --> 01:40:56.206]  It shows it's like they're weak and they're overconfident.
[01:40:56.206 --> 01:40:59.708]  And what is it you learn about these weirdos that get mentally ill and get megalomania?
[01:41:01.036 --> 01:41:05.786]  If they're a manager or some small thing, the more power they get, the crazier they get.
[01:41:05.786 --> 01:41:06.948]  That explains all of this.
[01:41:08.123 --> 01:41:12.124]  And Trump is just steadfastly like a leader, taking it all, going through it.
[01:41:12.124 --> 01:41:14.444]  And so now is the time.
[01:41:14.444 --> 01:41:15.925]  Everybody needs to pray for Trump.
[01:41:15.925 --> 01:41:16.725]  Pray for him forwards.
[01:41:16.725 --> 01:41:29.507]  They need to get these clips we just played and get them out to everybody, you know, so they understand this is happening and then don't pull back and get scared and put your head down, putting your head down at a crossroads of history.
[01:41:29.507 --> 01:41:33.388]  You may get ahead, putting your head down in different periods of life on average.
[01:41:34.048 --> 01:41:35.769]  You won't be a happy person.
[01:41:35.769 --> 01:41:42.331]  It'll end up leading towards collapse down the road, but at the end of the line, keeping your head down makes you go over the cliff.
[01:41:42.331 --> 01:41:45.432]  You're like in a canoe about to go over Niagara Falls.
[01:41:45.432 --> 01:41:47.893]  Keeping your head down is gonna get you destroyed.
[01:41:47.893 --> 01:41:51.175]  You gotta paddle over towards the land.
[01:41:51.175 --> 01:41:52.495]  You still got time.
[01:41:52.495 --> 01:41:54.056]  There's Niagara Falls.
[01:41:54.056 --> 01:41:54.836]  Oh, it's scary!
[01:41:54.836 --> 01:41:56.116]  Here, let's put our head between our knees.
[01:41:58.356 --> 01:41:59.917]  Don't have paddles?
[01:41:59.917 --> 01:42:02.480]  You better jump in the water and swim towards the shore.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.340]  Are you going to make it?
[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.022]  I don't know.
[01:42:05.022 --> 01:42:09.886]  But I'm rowing as hard as I can and I think we got a chance here.
[01:42:09.886 --> 01:42:14.550]  But I'm in the boat with a bunch of people that got their thumbs in their rear ends and I'm not complaining at most of you.
[01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:20.396]  I'm just saying, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I don't tell you about half the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.
[01:42:20.396 --> 01:42:21.757]  It's like a James Bond movie, okay?
[01:42:22.827 --> 01:42:27.130]  But I gotta tell you, most of their operatives and people I run into now are scared.
[01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:30.732]  They look at us like we're rock stars, and you can tell they want to join us.
[01:42:30.732 --> 01:42:31.552]  They're just scared.
[01:42:31.552 --> 01:42:33.193]  They don't like working for the system.
[01:42:33.193 --> 01:42:37.736]  And that's why the globalists are so close to the edge right now, is because they're minions.
[01:42:37.736 --> 01:42:43.559]  A lot of them are corrupt, but they're not psychopaths, and they're mercenaries, and they just want to have a future.
[01:42:43.559 --> 01:42:46.661]  And they realize there's no future under globalism.
[01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:47.862]  It's about austerity.
[01:42:48.783 --> 01:42:54.108]  And it's sick, and it's failed, and it's evil, and we don't want to be part of this.
[01:42:54.108 --> 01:43:00.974]  Now is the time when the chips are down, which our prognosis is great.
[01:43:00.974 --> 01:43:03.736]  This way is, you know, happy trails and green pastures.
[01:43:03.736 --> 01:43:05.137]  This way is hell on earth.
[01:43:05.137 --> 01:43:11.122]  But they're telling us this way towards the green pastures is hell, and heaven's towards the hellish part.
[01:43:12.034 --> 01:43:14.916]  If people just saw, they'd go, well, this is an easy choice.
[01:43:14.916 --> 01:43:24.542]  But the reason the chips are down is that the enemy is so bold and is publicly promoting coups now and civil war, while simultaneously saying it doesn't exist.
[01:43:24.542 --> 01:43:33.949]  When they speak to Davos or Aspen or Bilderberg or Charlie Rose, then it's, we want martial law and overthrow, because they're talking to intelligentsia.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.823]  But when they talk to the public, they're like CNN.
[01:43:37.823 --> 01:43:43.151]  Crazy Alex Jones says there's a plan for a coup, so he wants to kill Democrats.
[01:43:43.151 --> 01:43:44.674]  Never show you a clip of it, do they?
[01:43:45.862 --> 01:43:47.403]  They misrepresent... Oh, look!
[01:43:47.403 --> 01:43:48.344]  He's the cook!
[01:43:48.344 --> 01:43:49.384]  Ha ha!
[01:43:49.384 --> 01:43:51.886]  Comedy Central has whole shows now based on me.
[01:43:51.886 --> 01:43:53.427]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:43:53.427 --> 01:43:54.288]  Homeland!
[01:43:54.288 --> 01:43:57.810]  Everybody sees him, pointed... Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:43:57.810 --> 01:44:00.192]  He's the one that just guessed the lottery right ten times in a row.
[01:44:00.192 --> 01:44:01.113]  He's a cook.
[01:44:01.113 --> 01:44:02.414]  Oh, he just changed the whole world.
[01:44:02.414 --> 01:44:04.455]  Oh, the operating system, he rebooted.
[01:44:04.455 --> 01:44:06.376]  Americana's been picked up by the White House.
[01:44:06.376 --> 01:44:08.018]  Word for word, they figured it out.
[01:44:08.018 --> 01:44:11.080]  Exactly what I say, out of the mouths of all these people now.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:11.940]  And that's fine.
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:12.681]  I don't want the credit.
[01:44:12.961 --> 01:44:14.702]  The enemy already knows who gets the credit.
[01:44:14.702 --> 01:44:25.130]  They want to tell you, oh, we got all these shows demonizing him on HBO and Showtime and Comedy Central and they were attacking him everywhere and saying how evil and bad he is and how he needs to die because he's powerless.
[01:44:25.130 --> 01:44:33.676]  Yeah, we're all obsessed with him because he's powerless.
[01:44:33.676 --> 01:44:36.358]  I am the spirit of 1776 and so are you.
[01:44:36.358 --> 01:44:38.500]  All I am is a match of flame.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.101]  When there's no other flame around, it looks big.
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:48.403]  It's amazing, but all you've got to do is set brush fires and soon it's a bigger flame.
[01:44:48.403 --> 01:44:49.824]  And they go, oh, globalists.
[01:44:49.824 --> 01:44:51.265]  We'll just light the whole thing over.
[01:44:51.265 --> 01:44:53.346]  Oh, because the fire doesn't hurt us, it burns them.
[01:44:53.346 --> 01:44:54.526]  Oh, fire goes up.
[01:44:54.526 --> 01:44:55.707]  Oh, you want a revolution.
[01:44:55.707 --> 01:44:57.027]  Oh, how about 1776?
[01:44:57.027 --> 01:44:58.048]  Oh, political.
[01:44:58.048 --> 01:45:05.291]  Fires in the minds of men.
[01:45:05.291 --> 01:45:06.292]  I'm a flamethrower.
[01:45:07.267 --> 01:45:10.349]  And I've already set devastating fires in the enemy camp.
[01:45:10.349 --> 01:45:14.772]  I just want you to recognize we're under the main assault because they know.
[01:45:14.772 --> 01:45:21.017]  They call me a virus on CNN and on Fox and on MSN, MSNBC.
[01:45:21.017 --> 01:45:23.819]  The virus Alex Jones, the virus.
[01:45:23.819 --> 01:45:25.260]  Because I know who they are.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.040]  I know they're cowards.
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.021]  I know they're scum.
[01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:27.761]  I know they're filth.
[01:45:27.761 --> 01:45:30.063]  I know they hate their families if they even have them.
[01:45:30.063 --> 01:45:31.524]  I know them.
[01:45:31.524 --> 01:45:33.926]  I know that they know I'm not afraid.
[01:45:33.926 --> 01:45:35.987]  They hate that because they live in fear.
[01:45:35.987 --> 01:45:36.508]  They're rats.
[01:45:37.591 --> 01:45:41.377]  So here is the clip of, here is Rand Paul.
[01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:52.713]  Sometimes the media gets self-occupied with a story, the sort of, I think, made-up in a way, Russian story.
[01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:56.154]  But we get so occupied with it that we forget the good things that are happening.
[01:45:56.154 --> 01:45:58.315]  And I think a lot of good things have happened so far.
[01:45:58.315 --> 01:45:59.475]  And I always compare it every day.
[01:45:59.475 --> 01:46:02.556]  I wake up and say, it could have been Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:06.198]  We could be at war in the Middle East because Hillary Clinton wanted to go to war everywhere.
[01:46:06.198 --> 01:46:07.979]  And she would be at war with American business.
[01:46:07.979 --> 01:46:09.359]  It could be terrible.
[01:46:09.359 --> 01:46:11.620]  And I think Trump's doing a much better job than we would have gotten.
[01:46:14.397 --> 01:46:15.658]  There you go.
[01:46:15.658 --> 01:46:18.221]  The Pauls have total integrity and they're behind Trump.
[01:46:18.221 --> 01:46:20.363]  He's real, folks.
[01:46:20.363 --> 01:46:25.629]  I can't believe he's gotten this much done and we sit here and, bitch, they're going to kill him any day now.
[01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:28.492]  They're going to blow him and his family up, folks.
[01:46:28.492 --> 01:46:30.093]  Oh, they're going to wait until they get the whole family together.
[01:46:30.093 --> 01:46:30.954]  They want them all.
[01:46:30.954 --> 01:46:32.956]  Especially Donald Jr.
[01:46:32.956 --> 01:46:33.337]  Just watch!
[01:46:41.391 --> 01:46:47.852]  I can't believe that they've got Clapper and Brennan on TV calling for coups.
[01:46:47.852 --> 01:46:50.453]  And they've got these little weak spooks in Newsweek.
[01:46:50.453 --> 01:46:52.133]  Oh, God.
[01:46:52.133 --> 01:46:56.614]  And they're just so... We're just ruled by scum that hijacked everything.
[01:46:56.614 --> 01:46:57.734]  They didn't even conquer us.
[01:46:57.734 --> 01:47:01.094]  Now we're struggling, so they're trying to conquer us.
[01:47:01.094 --> 01:47:04.255]  And they're just such filth!
[01:47:04.255 --> 01:47:07.475]  Are we really ruled by these people?
[01:47:07.475 --> 01:47:09.556]  I need your support.
[01:47:09.556 --> 01:47:09.776]  You know?
[01:47:11.357 --> 01:47:17.539]  So many people have deficiencies and as we know so much of disease is caused by deficiencies.
[01:47:17.539 --> 01:47:18.739]  If you don't have vitamin C, you die.
[01:47:18.739 --> 01:47:21.219]  If you don't have selenium, you die.
[01:47:21.219 --> 01:47:25.100]  Just search selenium deficiencies, cancer, hundreds and hundreds of big studies.
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:26.461]  It's just amazing.
[01:47:26.461 --> 01:47:31.702]  And we wonder what's going on in our society with these fields that don't have the right minerals and cofactors in them and all the rest of it.
[01:47:33.066 --> 01:47:40.472]  We just sell products that I personally use and people love, produced by four of the biggest organic producers in the country.
[01:47:40.472 --> 01:47:43.815]  Groups one of them, the others are even bigger established companies.
[01:47:43.815 --> 01:47:48.399]  Our new Whey is one of the biggest, best organic companies.
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.662]  Grass-fed, whey, organic, super high quality.
[01:47:53.662 --> 01:47:56.243]  That's available out of the gate, 20% off.
[01:47:56.243 --> 01:47:57.503]  We've got Caveman Combo.
[01:47:57.503 --> 01:47:58.964]  The new strawberry flavor is excellent.
[01:47:58.964 --> 01:48:00.544]  Vanilla didn't taste too good, so we never launched that.
[01:48:00.544 --> 01:48:02.265]  We have chocolate and vanilla.
[01:48:02.265 --> 01:48:02.925]  Amazing.
[01:48:02.925 --> 01:48:07.347]  Bone broth concentrate and the turmeric, the chaga mushrooms, the beet pollen, so much more.
[01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:10.208]  It's the number one selling bone broth formula out there.
[01:48:10.208 --> 01:48:11.429]  Bone broth, obviously.
[01:48:11.429 --> 01:48:15.710]  It's the equivalent of chicken noodle soup to it squared.
[01:48:15.710 --> 01:48:16.491]  It's concentrated.
[01:48:17.844 --> 01:48:18.884]  So that's an amazing product.
[01:48:18.884 --> 01:48:20.865]  Now it's Strawberry Flavor, that's 25% off.
[01:48:20.865 --> 01:48:23.825]  Super Female Vitality, sells okay.
[01:48:23.825 --> 01:48:28.826]  Super Male is one of our best sellers, but Super Female is amazing, and it's almost the same formula as Super Male.
[01:48:28.826 --> 01:48:32.347]  The Super Male formula discount is gone because it's about to sell out.
[01:48:32.347 --> 01:48:39.548]  Super Female, we've got quite a bit of that, but I have no need to sell it at 57% off, which is basically a lost leader.
[01:48:39.548 --> 01:48:43.429]  But I'm doing it because I want women that have never tried it, or men,
[01:48:44.589 --> 01:48:45.090]  I don't know.
[01:49:04.913 --> 01:49:16.938]  We've got the Super Silver Special Colloidal Silver Bottle, Silver Bullet, the Super Blue Toothpaste with Colloidal Silver and Iodine, Fluoride Free, and the Electric Toothbrush.
[01:49:16.938 --> 01:49:19.259]  50% off, that's $34.93.
[01:49:19.259 --> 01:49:21.000]  Comparable toothbrushes don't sell for that much.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.741]  The toothbrush sells for $19 normally.
[01:49:22.741 --> 01:49:24.501]  We're selling it for $10 in that combo.
[01:49:24.501 --> 01:49:25.702]  That's what we get it for.
[01:49:25.702 --> 01:49:26.923]  So some of that is a loss later.
[01:49:26.923 --> 01:49:32.465]  The toothbrush is a loss later, but then we make some money on the toothpaste and the Silver Bullet with it.
[01:49:33.936 --> 01:49:35.977]  But that is an amazing deal.
[01:49:35.977 --> 01:49:38.037]  50% off on the Super Silver Special.
[01:49:38.037 --> 01:49:39.038]  Pro Pure Traveler.
[01:49:39.038 --> 01:49:39.758]  Amazing system.
[01:49:39.758 --> 01:49:42.479]  Very best gravity filter out there.
[01:49:42.479 --> 01:49:44.059]  That's 30% off.
[01:49:44.059 --> 01:49:44.960]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:45.660]  Amazing.
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:46.360]  Comparable units.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.041]  Costs $200, $300 more.
[01:49:48.041 --> 01:49:48.421]  It's $149.
[01:49:48.421 --> 01:49:50.742]  At its normal, $219.
[01:49:50.742 --> 01:49:52.522]  It's a super deal.
[01:49:52.522 --> 01:49:53.503]  Great system.
[01:49:53.503 --> 01:49:56.424]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion with amino acids as well.
[01:49:56.424 --> 01:49:56.464]  $39.95.
[01:49:56.464 --> 01:49:56.844]  That's 33% off.
[01:49:56.844 --> 01:49:57.384]  Knockout is $14.95.
[01:49:57.384 --> 01:49:57.544]  50% off.
[01:49:57.544 --> 01:49:58.064]  Prostagard is 33% off.
[01:50:03.747 --> 01:50:08.148]  Microsdx is 46% off because I want you to see the other part of the equation.
[01:50:09.557 --> 01:50:15.561]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:15.561 --> 01:50:18.363]  It targets the fungus and all the rest of the garbage.
[01:50:18.363 --> 01:50:21.525]  Owen Schroyer's riding a shotgun there very dutifully because I'm on the road.
[01:50:21.525 --> 01:50:22.705]  He doesn't have any glitches.
[01:50:22.705 --> 01:50:23.346]  He pops in.
[01:50:23.346 --> 01:50:25.007]  We come back for several segments.
[01:50:25.007 --> 01:50:35.593]  We're taking your calls ahead of the big pastor, friends with Trump, been on before, patriot, Mr. Brown, who met with the senior congressman about the Marshall Law Plan, the coup plan.
[01:50:35.593 --> 01:50:37.575]  Now, he brought this out on Monday.
[01:50:39.281 --> 01:50:40.842]  Here we are on Wednesday.
[01:50:40.842 --> 01:50:44.984]  Yesterday, a day after, Brennan comes out and says it on TV.
[01:50:44.984 --> 01:50:45.864]  They're getting a coup ready.
[01:50:45.864 --> 01:50:46.644]  So, see?
[01:50:46.644 --> 01:50:48.205]  The credibility of this.
[01:50:48.205 --> 01:50:50.266]  So, that means they're getting ready to go live.
[01:50:51.795 --> 01:50:57.641]  We hope to back them off and stop them, but if we don't make a big deal out of this, if we let them normalize it, they're going to pull it.
[01:50:57.641 --> 01:51:00.684]  So, again, but free shipping on top of all those specials.
[01:51:00.684 --> 01:51:02.165]  That ends this week.
[01:51:02.165 --> 01:51:04.448]  It's been throughout the month of July, but it's about to end.
[01:51:04.448 --> 01:51:07.291]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:51:38.706 --> 01:51:40.587]  A real zinc shortage is upon us.
[01:51:40.587 --> 01:51:48.672]  The Wall Street Journal says zinc supplies are down to three weeks, mine supplies struggling to meet demand, and no major discoveries in the last 22 years.
[01:51:48.672 --> 01:51:49.813]  What's it mean for you?
[01:51:49.813 --> 01:51:55.616]  Keith Neumeyer, who's made hundreds of millions investing in hard asset mining plays, is making his biggest call yet.

[01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:39.452]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:52:39.452 --> 01:52:43.195]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[01:53:55.656 --> 01:53:57.096]  Or warm and served.

[01:54:14.267 --> 01:54:22.754]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:54:24.983 --> 01:54:27.184]  We are defending the Republic here.
[01:54:27.184 --> 01:54:28.864]  Thanks to the listeners, we're breaking through.
[01:54:28.864 --> 01:54:30.725]  We've got a president in.
[01:54:30.725 --> 01:54:34.726]  The globalists are counter-striking and revealing themselves even more.
[01:54:34.726 --> 01:54:38.027]  We're going to go to Steve, Patrick, Jason, Carlos, Megan and others.
[01:54:38.027 --> 01:54:44.948]  Ahead of Pastor Brown exposing the martial law from his White House meeting that the Democrats are planning, he'll be joining us.
[01:54:44.948 --> 01:54:50.890]  The planned coup, the murder of the president, now being publicly announced by Brennan and others on national television.
[01:54:50.890 --> 01:54:54.151]  They're just reporting like it's very calm, that we're going to bipartisanly take him out.
[01:54:54.631 --> 01:54:55.752]  In a coop.
[01:54:55.752 --> 01:54:58.013]  And they're moving forward with that right now.
[01:54:58.013 --> 01:55:00.394]  Outside of elections, outside of impeachment.
[01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:03.075]  Wolf Blitzer says, but you know, you have to have Congress removing me.
[01:55:03.075 --> 01:55:06.156]  No, no, we have other things we're doing.
[01:55:06.156 --> 01:55:07.697]  And so, there you go.
[01:55:07.697 --> 01:55:10.458]  Blitzer's smart enough to hedge his bets.
[01:55:10.458 --> 01:55:13.919]  Doesn't sound too safe, does it, old Blitzy?
[01:55:13.919 --> 01:55:16.381]  You guys are really going to go too far, aren't you?
[01:55:16.381 --> 01:55:17.741]  You can't help it, though.
[01:55:17.741 --> 01:55:19.602]  All of you want to get your feet wet.
[01:55:19.602 --> 01:55:23.864]  All the little wimp analysts want to be tough guys out there, want to get your feet wet.
[01:55:24.602 --> 01:55:27.825]  Well, boy, I hope it doesn't rain, but if it does, it's going to rain a lot.
[01:55:27.825 --> 01:55:31.007]  And I think you're going to get your face wet.
[01:55:31.007 --> 01:55:34.810]  Let's go ahead and go to Patrick in North Carolina.
[01:55:34.810 --> 01:55:36.171]  Patrick, you are on the air.
[01:55:36.171 --> 01:55:39.494]  How's it going Alex?
[01:55:39.494 --> 01:55:41.055]  Good, buddy, go ahead.
[01:55:41.055 --> 01:55:42.717]  Welcome.
[01:55:42.717 --> 01:55:48.862]  I was calling to say that I think that Attorney General Jeff Sessions needs to go.
[01:55:48.862 --> 01:55:54.106]  I think Trump needs to start purging everybody, whether the Democrat, Republican, he needs to expose them.
[01:55:54.645 --> 01:55:59.866]  And I think he needs to take it a step further and even expose the Federal Reserve.
[01:55:59.866 --> 01:56:01.666]  Well, he has announced a move to audit it.
[01:56:01.666 --> 01:56:03.307]  That's why he's got the polls behind him.
[01:56:03.307 --> 01:56:04.787]  And he's getting real close to Rand Paul.
[01:56:04.787 --> 01:56:06.067]  That's my dream that that would happen.
[01:56:06.067 --> 01:56:09.368]  I know Drudge might have had something to do with that, a little bird told me.
[01:56:09.368 --> 01:56:13.349]  There's a lot of exciting things going on behind the scenes.
[01:56:13.349 --> 01:56:14.629]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:15.509]  I mean, he's got to do it.
[01:56:15.509 --> 01:56:17.810]  They're the ones dereliction of duty.
[01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:22.251]  And Sessions has done a great job in the Senate, but he's choking.
[01:56:22.251 --> 01:56:22.911]  He's choking.
[01:56:24.986 --> 01:56:28.249]  I believe he's going against the will of the American people.
[01:56:28.249 --> 01:56:31.231]  You know, he's battling in the wrong areas.
[01:56:31.231 --> 01:56:37.536]  He really needs to go after these people, go after the criminals who are bringing us down.
[01:56:37.536 --> 01:56:39.157]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:56:39.157 --> 01:56:42.119]  We have to go after the current infestation in D.C.
[01:56:42.119 --> 01:56:43.400]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:47.884]  They're doing a great job, 69% down in illegals coming across the borders six months in.
[01:56:48.544 --> 01:56:51.866]  So, I mean, Sessions is doing a great job, other than prosecute Hillary.
[01:56:51.866 --> 01:56:53.187]  We have to get on the offense.
[01:56:53.187 --> 01:56:55.049]  Everything they say Trump's done, they've done.
[01:56:55.049 --> 01:56:55.709]  Great points, sir.
[01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:58.751]  Alright, we got Megan, Carlos, Steven, Jason.
[01:56:58.751 --> 01:57:00.573]  You want to comment on what he just said real quick, Owen?
[01:57:02.230 --> 01:57:16.577]  Well, I mean, it's obvious at this point that if Trump doesn't have an administration and a cabinet that's not only communicating together, that's why he brought in Scaramucci, but also is willing to not play defense but also go on the offense.
[01:57:16.577 --> 01:57:19.218]  You know, I mean, that's something that you've been saying since the election.
[01:57:19.218 --> 01:57:20.999]  Why isn't Trump going on the offense?
[01:57:20.999 --> 01:57:21.859]  Why isn't he?
[01:57:21.859 --> 01:57:23.260]  I mean, Alex, this is a joke!
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:29.047]  You had Debbie Washerman Schultz, IT person, get arrested trying to flee the country, okay?
[01:57:29.047 --> 01:57:33.893]  You had Lee Stranahan on yesterday breaking down the collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Ukrainians.
[01:57:33.893 --> 01:57:35.675]  Nothing on the Hill today, Alex!
[01:57:35.675 --> 01:57:36.556]  Zero!
[01:57:36.556 --> 01:57:38.258]  Zero on the mainstream news!
[01:57:38.258 --> 01:57:38.619]  Zero!
[01:57:39.827 --> 01:57:42.169]  Where is the Attorney General on that?
[01:57:42.169 --> 01:57:46.893]  We have the Democrats colluding basically with over 50 foreign governments and getting money.
[01:57:46.893 --> 01:57:50.096]  Hundreds of millions from foreign governments into the election coffer.
[01:57:50.096 --> 01:57:51.357]  They should all go to jail.
[01:57:51.357 --> 01:57:52.338]  It's open and shut.
[01:57:52.338 --> 01:57:55.721]  But they're trying to find a crooked fingernail on Trump.
[01:57:55.721 --> 01:58:00.366]  And they've got to drag that out so big they're going to find something in his whole system.
[01:58:00.366 --> 01:58:06.051]  Yeah Mueller can do whatever he wants now and that's because of the special counsel giving him free reign.
[01:58:07.805 --> 01:58:08.506]  Absolutely.
[01:58:08.506 --> 01:58:09.448]  Let's go to another call.
[01:58:09.448 --> 01:58:11.772]  We see Steve, who's been home the longest here.
[01:58:11.772 --> 01:58:13.755]  Let's talk to Steve in New York.
[01:58:13.755 --> 01:58:17.782]  Steve, thanks for holding with Jason in Germany.
[01:58:17.782 --> 01:58:18.423]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:18.423 --> 01:58:19.905]  Can you hear me?
[01:58:19.905 --> 01:58:20.186]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:21.707 --> 01:58:24.348]  Hey, it's incredible to be able to get through to you.
[01:58:24.348 --> 01:58:28.250]  I've been trying to get through for two years, so I guess miracles are possible.
[01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:29.610]  Well, a miracle's about to happen.
[01:58:29.610 --> 01:58:30.771]  I didn't hear the music coming up.
[01:58:30.771 --> 01:58:31.331]  I'm on the road.
[01:58:31.331 --> 01:58:32.111]  70 seconds.
[01:58:32.111 --> 01:58:33.652]  I'm coming right back to you, Steve.
[01:58:33.652 --> 01:58:34.572]  Don't hang up.
[01:58:34.572 --> 01:58:41.015]  We're 70 seconds away from Steve, and then we're about eight, nine minutes away from Pastor Brown, and we'll continue on with your calls.
[01:58:41.015 --> 01:58:49.398]  But Steve, Jason, Carlos, Megan, John, everybody, your calls are straight ahead.

[02:00:00.008 --> 02:00:02.650]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:34.053 --> 02:00:38.214]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.214 --> 02:00:49.777]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[02:00:49.777 --> 02:00:52.198]  Everyone listening has a choice to make.
[02:00:52.198 --> 02:00:55.999]  What are you doing during the Second American Revolution?
[02:00:55.999 --> 02:00:58.640]  As we face an evil far more wicked than King George III.
[02:01:00.487 --> 02:01:14.678]  What are you going to do as Brennan and Clapper on the same stage discuss a violent coup against the President and his removal, forcibly from office, a new election run by Democrat-controlled Homeland Security?
[02:01:14.678 --> 02:01:15.879]  We'll never come back from this.
[02:01:15.879 --> 02:01:27.489]  This is the pure conversion to authoritarianism because they know America has rejected their collectivism, their globalism, their political correctness, their anti-Christian, pro-radical Islam garbage.
[02:01:27.489 --> 02:01:28.770]  What are you going to do?
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:32.942]  To stop them openly calling for a violent coup.
[02:01:32.942 --> 02:01:38.207]  What are you going to do to raise the alarm and not let them normalize it on national television?
[02:01:38.207 --> 02:01:39.888]  That's the question I'm asking.
[02:01:39.888 --> 02:01:43.191]  Stephen New York, go ahead sir.
[02:01:43.191 --> 02:01:44.392]  Hey Alex.
[02:01:44.392 --> 02:01:49.256]  I just wanted to say that I bought 30 of the Trump shirts.
[02:01:49.256 --> 02:01:55.181]  I'm wearing a Trump-Pence 2020 shirt now and I get a lot of good comments when I go.
[02:01:55.181 --> 02:01:57.523]  I'm in New England near New York and Vermont and
[02:01:58.872 --> 02:02:11.346]  It's just incredible the power that I feel when I'm watching your show, and I don't want to say thanks a million times, but really, thanks.
[02:02:11.346 --> 02:02:17.853]  I've given away the shirts to the veterans that come from my customers in my store, so they're really glad.
[02:02:17.853 --> 02:02:20.656]  It might be just one or two of them I give out, but
[02:02:21.118 --> 02:02:27.620]  I can tell in their heart they really feel and they understand what you're doing there.
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:29.421]  I just wanted to say that.
[02:02:29.421 --> 02:02:38.304]  As far as the coup goes, I know I've heard you say a lot of times that when the bomber is over the target, the flak comes in.
[02:02:38.304 --> 02:02:42.205]  I think this is really what's happening here.
[02:02:42.205 --> 02:02:43.365]  The flak is coming in.
[02:02:43.365 --> 02:02:44.746]  Trump's on target.
[02:02:45.086 --> 02:02:45.866]  You're on target.
[02:02:45.866 --> 02:02:46.827]  You're making a difference.
[02:02:46.827 --> 02:02:47.947]  They're feeling it.
[02:02:47.947 --> 02:02:49.108]  They're feeling the pressure.
[02:02:49.108 --> 02:02:52.149]  The reason I don't want you to thank me is you're getting it backwards.
[02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.990]  It's you.
[02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:54.591]  You're the reason they're in trouble.
[02:02:54.591 --> 02:02:56.031]  We're just a focal point.
[02:02:56.031 --> 02:02:57.332]  Trump's just a focal point.
[02:02:57.332 --> 02:02:58.572]  Understand that.
[02:02:58.572 --> 02:02:59.613]  But it's symbiotic.
[02:02:59.613 --> 02:03:03.515]  They want to destroy us to get at you, to make you be demoralized.
[02:03:03.515 --> 02:03:05.976]  But no matter what they do to me or Trump, we're winning.
[02:03:05.976 --> 02:03:07.577]  We're never going to fail.
[02:03:07.577 --> 02:03:11.178]  If they're dumb enough to kill us, it'll blow up even bigger in their face.
[02:03:11.178 --> 02:03:13.940]  But at that point, unfortunately, they've crossed the line.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:17.961]  And just understand they're going to try to trick the police into a civil war.
[02:03:17.961 --> 02:03:19.522]  You got to go around them.
[02:03:19.522 --> 02:03:25.444]  Everybody has to understand we've got to work as hard as we can to stop a violent revolution, a violent civil war.
[02:03:25.444 --> 02:03:29.165]  But if they push us into one, they've drawn first blood.
[02:03:29.165 --> 02:03:34.026]  Everybody's got to commit and just like forget the maneuvers, go straight at them.
[02:03:34.026 --> 02:03:39.668]  And everybody's got to really think about who runs the show, who's responsible in your area, right on up.
[02:03:39.668 --> 02:03:40.949]  Who asked for this fight?
[02:03:40.949 --> 02:03:41.489]  Who pushed it?
[02:03:43.297 --> 02:03:44.058]  Sure.
[02:03:44.058 --> 02:03:45.018]  I understand.
[02:03:45.018 --> 02:03:45.979]  I'm making a difference.
[02:03:45.979 --> 02:03:47.861]  I'm doing what I can.
[02:03:47.861 --> 02:03:52.064]  But like I say, I'm a New Yorker and I understand Trump.
[02:03:52.064 --> 02:03:53.085]  I've seen, you know,
[02:03:53.695 --> 02:04:06.403]  What he's done, and I know his capabilities, and we've only just gotten started, and he doesn't even have his staff picked out yet, and you know, it's already ridiculous.
[02:04:06.403 --> 02:04:09.305]  That's right, they've tried to block him for six months with everything they've gotten.
[02:04:09.305 --> 02:04:14.569]  They keep saying he's got nothing legislative done, but via executive he's done wonders to kill globalism.
[02:04:14.569 --> 02:04:15.449]  God bless you, Steve.
[02:04:15.449 --> 02:04:16.310]  More calls coming up.
[02:04:16.730 --> 02:04:24.015]  Well, I think that one of the issues that Trump has right now is if Sessions was to resign or to be fired, now he has to jump over another hurdle of getting another AG through all the testimonies and appointed
[02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:49.430]  When you know that the swamp is going to try to stop that.
[02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:50.030]  That's right.
[02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:52.971]  I mean, it's just a nightmare because people are scared.
[02:04:52.971 --> 02:04:53.651]  They're being threatened.
[02:04:53.651 --> 02:04:54.691]  Their families are being threatened.
[02:04:54.691 --> 02:04:55.331]  Exactly.
[02:04:55.331 --> 02:04:56.512]  That's the key right there.
[02:04:56.512 --> 02:04:58.212]  I'm worried about Jeff Sessions and his family.
[02:04:58.212 --> 02:04:59.913]  I pray for them.
[02:04:59.913 --> 02:05:00.453]  Absolutely.
[02:05:00.453 --> 02:05:01.833]  There's no telling what he's been through.
[02:05:01.833 --> 02:05:03.653]  But this is just a nightmare situation.
[02:05:03.653 --> 02:05:04.714]  We're in a war, folks.
[02:05:04.714 --> 02:05:05.634]  We're in a war.
[02:05:05.634 --> 02:05:05.994]  We'll be back.
[02:05:08.386 --> 02:05:15.370]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[02:05:15.370 --> 02:05:20.873]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[02:05:20.873 --> 02:05:24.215]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[02:05:24.215 --> 02:05:26.576]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[02:05:26.576 --> 02:05:31.919]  And how do we remove that power from Washington, to our local communities, to the individual?
[02:05:31.919 --> 02:05:33.500]  That is the ultimate concern.
[02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:39.904]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[02:05:39.904 --> 02:05:42.405]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[02:05:42.405 --> 02:05:46.708]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[02:05:46.708 --> 02:05:51.011]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[02:05:51.451 --> 02:05:56.815]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[02:05:56.815 --> 02:06:02.198]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[02:06:02.198 --> 02:06:05.840]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:07.742]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:08.601 --> 02:06:19.184]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:06:19.184 --> 02:06:21.244]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:06:21.244 --> 02:06:24.105]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:06:24.105 --> 02:06:25.606]  It's made in the USA.
[02:06:25.606 --> 02:06:32.427]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:06:32.427 --> 02:06:33.648]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:06:34.488 --> 02:06:44.215]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:06:44.215 --> 02:07:01.027]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:07:01.027 --> 02:07:04.189]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:07:04.329 --> 02:07:08.351]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:07:08.351 --> 02:07:14.054]  Rediscover your fire with the EcoZoom Coal Rocket Camping Stove.

[02:07:22.058 --> 02:07:25.220]  And that means big power in a portable package.
[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:26.841]  The Versa cooks fast.
[02:07:27.441 --> 02:07:31.223]  It produces less smoke and it's fuel efficient.
[02:07:31.223 --> 02:07:35.845]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.
[02:07:35.845 --> 02:07:41.888]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.
[02:07:41.888 --> 02:07:47.050]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal, you got yourself an entire meal.

[02:08:03.029 --> 02:08:07.494]  Available right now at, you guessed it, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:08:10.831 --> 02:08:18.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:21.583]  There it is, the Howard Brown Club.
[02:08:21.583 --> 02:08:22.284]  Come to me.
[02:08:30.774 --> 02:08:43.459]  Ladies and gentlemen, we can see for miles and miles and miles and miles, because we have great patriots like Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, who's warned of the dangers of collectivism, globalism, you name it.
[02:08:43.459 --> 02:08:52.842]  He and his wife in 1987 fled South Africa as it was beginning to collapse with $300 and four suitcases and their three children.
[02:08:53.931 --> 02:09:08.366]  And now he has Revival Ministries International, travels 46 weeks out of the year, has their great church in Tampa that supports them, Revival.com, one of the most successful, prolific, and powerful evangelical preachers out there.
[02:09:08.366 --> 02:09:10.728]  One of the guys I enjoy, I know, watching and listening to.
[02:09:10.728 --> 02:09:14.052]  You can just tell he's got the spirit, the focus, and the courage.
[02:09:16.391 --> 02:09:18.252]  Standing against tyranny.
[02:09:18.252 --> 02:09:30.279]  They are organizing in the Financial Times of London, New Yorker Magazine, Foreign Affairs, Public Affairs of the CFR, and Atlantic Monthly, a coup, a violent killing of the President.
[02:09:30.279 --> 02:09:36.823]  They even have articles where Deputy Secretaries of Defense under Obama shop a Pentagon coup, and it's in the newspaper.
[02:09:38.024 --> 02:09:39.665]  We're selling it like it's normal.
[02:09:39.665 --> 02:09:41.847]  We're talking about an illegal action.
[02:09:41.847 --> 02:09:54.536]  Now, three days after this video clip came out of him addressing his church, coming back from Washington this Sunday, Brennan, the former head of the CIA, came out at the Aspen Institute yesterday.
[02:09:54.536 --> 02:09:55.717]  Paul Watson wrote about it today.
[02:09:55.717 --> 02:09:58.319]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:58.319 --> 02:10:00.561]  We played the clip three times already and said,
[02:10:02.248 --> 02:10:03.609]  Oh, we're not going to have impeachment.
[02:10:03.609 --> 02:10:19.697]  We're getting bipartisan in the government, the bureaucracy, to prepare a coup, confirming everything that a senior member of the Republican Party in Congress told Pastor Rodney Howard Brown of Revival.com.
[02:10:19.697 --> 02:10:23.099]  But now we have them saying it publicly.
[02:10:23.099 --> 02:10:24.640]  So they're doing that.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:25.961]  You say, well, don't they want it to be secret?
[02:10:25.961 --> 02:10:26.221]  No, no, no.
[02:10:27.381 --> 02:10:29.782]  They've lost the election, the Russian thing's made up.
[02:10:29.782 --> 02:10:35.966]  They've done illegal spying for the few Russian contacts that were there, because the Russians throw themselves at everybody, just like the Chinese.
[02:10:35.966 --> 02:10:38.367]  Of course they've got their people out there.
[02:10:38.367 --> 02:10:40.689]  Trump's met with them to see if there was dirt on Hillary.
[02:10:40.689 --> 02:10:41.509]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[02:10:41.509 --> 02:10:44.551]  Trump said, if you got the WikiLeaks of her emails, release them.
[02:10:44.551 --> 02:10:46.612]  She's the one committing the crimes.
[02:10:46.612 --> 02:10:48.233]  She's the one with the uranium deals.
[02:10:48.233 --> 02:10:51.495]  She's the one with the foundation, 100 plus million from Russian banks.
[02:10:51.495 --> 02:10:56.218]  So they turn it all around, and still they're failing, and they know Trump's getting more support, not less.
[02:10:58.965 --> 02:11:00.287]  So they're panicking.
[02:11:00.287 --> 02:11:14.065]  So here is the pastor this Sunday laying this out and now, days later, the former CIA director, the same one that told the president to shut his mouth, goes public trying to sell the idea.
[02:11:14.065 --> 02:11:14.866]  Here is the pastor.
[02:11:15.969 --> 02:11:26.075]  As high as what Monday was, Tuesday was a low because I got to go into the Congress and spend three hours from 9.30 in the evening to 12.30 a.m.
[02:11:26.075 --> 02:11:36.601]  with one of the senior ranking members of Congress and he told me and of course this is what I said on CBN but they cut it out but I'm gonna go public with this because we have to.
[02:11:36.601 --> 02:11:38.703]  He said there is a plot on Capitol Hill
[02:11:39.483 --> 02:11:40.703]  To take the president out.
[02:11:40.703 --> 02:11:43.164]  I said, you mean by impeachment or by indictment?
[02:11:43.164 --> 02:11:44.965]  He said, no, to take him out.
[02:11:44.965 --> 02:11:46.705]  He will be removed suddenly from office.
[02:11:46.705 --> 02:11:48.506]  Well, you can read between the lines.
[02:11:48.506 --> 02:11:51.187]  I said, look, I said, that's not going to happen.
[02:11:51.187 --> 02:11:53.847]  He said, he said, well, really, there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[02:11:53.847 --> 02:12:00.789]  I said, we are going to stop it because we're going to mobilize the body of Christ to pray.
[02:12:00.789 --> 02:12:02.390]  So listen, they started a war.
[02:12:03.550 --> 02:12:10.037]  You know, they are so upset about what's happening because since when last has the body of Christ had access into the White House?
[02:12:10.037 --> 02:12:12.039]  It wasn't that way under Reagan.
[02:12:12.039 --> 02:12:14.081]  They might come and go a little bit.
[02:12:14.081 --> 02:12:15.843]  It wasn't that way under Clinton.
[02:12:15.843 --> 02:12:17.885]  It wasn't that way under both Bushes.
[02:12:17.885 --> 02:12:20.247]  And it definitely wasn't that way under Obama.
[02:12:20.247 --> 02:12:23.451]  But we have a president that's opened the door for the body of Christ.
[02:12:23.451 --> 02:12:25.292]  And that is huge.
[02:12:25.292 --> 02:12:26.494]  Whichever way you want to look at it.
[02:12:27.174 --> 02:12:30.198]  And let me tell you, you know, everybody's moaning Republican, Democrat.
[02:12:30.198 --> 02:12:31.519]  He actually is neither.
[02:12:31.519 --> 02:12:35.604]  He's basically a populist that the American people voted for.
[02:12:35.604 --> 02:12:38.868]  They put a businessman in the White House because things are so fouled up.
[02:12:38.868 --> 02:12:44.073]  Well, if you want to really see fouled up, go to Congress and go sit and talk to the... He's been there since 96.
[02:12:45.595 --> 02:12:48.577]  So he knows everything, everything about what's going on.
[02:12:48.577 --> 02:12:56.022]  And I can tell you the games that are being played, how they're actually trying to set the president up in every way.
[02:12:56.022 --> 02:13:03.067]  But when he told me what he said, that they are planning, the talk on the Hill is the plan that suddenly he'll be removed.
[02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:17.302]  So what we're going to do, we're going to launch it today as a 24-hour prayer initiative to pray around the clock, and we do it across the nation, around the world, for the protection of the president.
[02:13:17.302 --> 02:13:18.383]  Absolutely.
[02:13:18.383 --> 02:13:25.285]  Joining us, and a lot of people know this, as you know, big national Christian networks got this info, they're scared to run it.
[02:13:25.285 --> 02:13:30.246]  Now, they have the former CIA director admitting that they're actually planning to do this.
[02:13:30.246 --> 02:13:35.248]  This is so illegal, this is so criminal, and Trump, when I've talked to him, he said, without even bringing it up,
[02:13:36.445 --> 02:13:37.665]  You know the First Amendment, Alex.
[02:13:37.665 --> 02:13:40.587]  Congress shall make no law respecting an established religion.
[02:13:40.587 --> 02:13:42.147]  The government's not supposed to be involved.
[02:13:42.147 --> 02:13:45.929]  We're going to get the First Amendment back to the churches.
[02:13:45.929 --> 02:13:47.989]  He said that's the first thing I'm going to do.
[02:13:47.989 --> 02:13:48.810]  He brings it up.
[02:13:48.810 --> 02:13:52.771]  He is really upset about the fact that only Democrat churches have free speech.
[02:13:52.771 --> 02:13:54.752]  And that's another reason they're mad.
[02:13:54.752 --> 02:14:02.075]  So this is about a man that's not a fake Pharisee, but somebody who really does love God, and who's been through a process
[02:14:02.495 --> 02:14:07.699]  The last five years of getting closer to God, almost like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus.
[02:14:07.699 --> 02:14:11.181]  But I'm going to stop preaching because our preacher is here with us right now.
[02:14:11.181 --> 02:14:12.502]  He's only with us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:14:12.502 --> 02:14:16.385]  He might be able to stay a little bit longer, but I wanted to intro that with his words.
[02:14:16.385 --> 02:14:19.247]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, Revival.com.
[02:14:19.247 --> 02:14:22.430]  Thank you so much for joining us during this critical time.
[02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:27.513]  Hey Alex, I can't believe you're speaking to me from beautiful Hawaii.
[02:14:27.513 --> 02:14:29.515]  And I tell you, you know God's real when you see this place.
[02:14:31.570 --> 02:14:33.211]  It's so good to be here with you today.
[02:14:33.211 --> 02:14:39.777]  You know, we actually have conducted meetings in Washington, D.C.
[02:14:39.777 --> 02:14:40.478]  I started in 2014.
[02:14:40.478 --> 02:14:46.202]  Went to Constitution Hall, which is right in the shadow of the White House, for 15 nights.
[02:14:46.202 --> 02:14:48.184]  Because I didn't know what to do.
[02:14:48.184 --> 02:14:52.107]  You know, we could sit and moan about the things in the government, but we have to do something.
[02:14:52.107 --> 02:14:54.530]  So for 15 nights I went there, preached.
[02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:56.872]  We had 31,000 people give their lives to the Lord.
[02:14:57.592 --> 02:15:11.841]  And I also stood every night, must have looked like a total idiot, and just issued a restraining order, basically in prayer, telling the devil, you can't have America speaking to the powers that be, to cease and desist in their maneuvers.
[02:15:11.841 --> 02:15:18.745]  And we went back in 2015, we went back in 2016, and of course now, God has given us a last minute reprieve.
[02:15:18.745 --> 02:15:23.508]  We're not through the woods, because all the Never Trumpers, all the neocons,
[02:15:24.628 --> 02:15:28.989]  All the people that didn't want the president are still working against him.
[02:15:28.989 --> 02:15:34.571]  And so Monday, two weeks ago, when we went in, we actually weren't going to meet with the president.
[02:15:34.571 --> 02:15:38.372]  We were just there in strategy meeting with 25, myself and 25 other leaders.
[02:15:40.293 --> 02:15:44.015]  With the president and different members of the administration were coming in.
[02:15:44.015 --> 02:15:46.077]  We were talking to them, asking questions.
[02:15:46.077 --> 02:15:48.058]  After lunch, Jared Kushner came in.
[02:15:48.058 --> 02:15:49.759]  We asked him questions.
[02:15:49.759 --> 02:15:51.240]  You could ask whatever you want to.
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:55.003]  I mean, I don't think this has ever been allowed before in any White House I know.
[02:15:56.027 --> 02:16:00.769]  And then he left about an hour later, he walked the Vice President.
[02:16:00.769 --> 02:16:02.230]  And so when I saw him, I stood up.
[02:16:02.230 --> 02:16:04.691]  People didn't know where I was standing, but there was the Vice President.
[02:16:04.691 --> 02:16:06.592]  He said, I was in the Oval Office.
[02:16:06.592 --> 02:16:09.574]  Jared came in, told me that you guys were here.
[02:16:09.574 --> 02:16:11.215]  And I said, the President, I'm going to go see them.
[02:16:11.215 --> 02:16:14.336]  And the President said, no, bring them down to the Oval Office.
[02:16:14.336 --> 02:16:16.097]  So we went down unannounced.
[02:16:16.097 --> 02:16:19.559]  It was like very surreal for me coming as a missionary from Africa.
[02:16:20.659 --> 02:16:28.824]  30 years ago, now you stand yourself standing in the Oval Office, and I felt to go and stand behind him, because I'm not on his side or in front of him, I'm behind him.
[02:16:28.824 --> 02:16:32.546]  I'm supporting our President, and I did from day one.
[02:16:32.546 --> 02:16:43.432]  And so, that picture you see of the hands, that's my hand, my wife's hand, and of course, I waited until the White House gave us permission to release it, and then we did.
[02:16:43.432 --> 02:16:49.195]  Of course, it went viral, picked up by the Mail Online in London, South Africa, Australia, we were getting calls from all over.
[02:16:49.835 --> 02:16:54.176]  And so, of course, the media all freaking out about the picture because how terrible.
[02:16:54.176 --> 02:16:58.038]  I mean, CNN said, isn't this terrible that they were touching the president?
[02:16:58.038 --> 02:17:00.318]  But the president has no problem with it.
[02:17:00.318 --> 02:17:06.020]  People have no clue that, you know, he's undone already 60% of the Obama agenda.
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:10.061]  You judge a tree by its fruits, and exactly.
[02:17:10.061 --> 02:17:12.102]  When I've talked to Trump, he brings it up.
[02:17:12.102 --> 02:17:14.843]  He says, you feel the spirit in that inauguration.
[02:17:14.843 --> 02:17:19.984]  Do you feel the spirit at the event there in Cleveland?
[02:17:19.984 --> 02:17:28.887]  He really does feel the energy of God and of Christians, and the more Christians embrace him, the more his faith is getting strengthened.
[02:17:28.887 --> 02:17:30.148]  That's what's scaring him right now.
[02:17:31.058 --> 02:17:31.538]  Totally.
[02:17:31.538 --> 02:17:33.280]  So they're really afraid.
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:35.162]  And it was a most amazing time.
[02:17:35.162 --> 02:17:38.064]  You know, they said he was, you know, uptight.
[02:17:38.064 --> 02:17:39.766]  He was relaxed, joking.
[02:17:39.766 --> 02:17:41.027]  It was very funny.
[02:17:41.027 --> 02:17:44.270]  You know, I'm very proud of the president.
[02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:47.914]  Now, so as high as what Monday was, Tuesday was like a low.
[02:17:47.914 --> 02:17:51.156]  I go into the Congress and I can't divulge the name.
[02:17:51.156 --> 02:17:52.598]  It was a senior congressman.
[02:17:52.598 --> 02:17:53.499]  But here's what he said.
[02:17:53.959 --> 02:17:56.120]  You know, first of all, we went for three hours.
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:59.681]  He talked about the health care plan that was going to be passed.
[02:17:59.681 --> 02:18:01.521]  He said, it's not really the president.
[02:18:01.521 --> 02:18:03.722]  This is Paul Ryan's plan.
[02:18:03.722 --> 02:18:05.983]  And it's going to make Paul Ryan 800 billion.
[02:18:05.983 --> 02:18:11.844]  And then he would be able to do whatever he wants to do with it and basically set up the president for a weakened position in 2018 and 2020.
[02:18:14.005 --> 02:18:21.330]  So, we talked about many things, and then he said, the talk on the Hill is that the President will be removed suddenly in the next two months.
[02:18:21.330 --> 02:18:22.631]  I said, what are you talking about?
[02:18:22.631 --> 02:18:23.452]  Impeachment?
[02:18:23.452 --> 02:18:23.952]  Indictment?
[02:18:23.952 --> 02:18:24.973]  He said, no.
[02:18:24.973 --> 02:18:27.194]  He'll be removed suddenly.
[02:18:27.194 --> 02:18:32.338]  And I'm not even maybe talking about somebody firing a bullet, but he would be immobilized.
[02:18:32.338 --> 02:18:34.460]  He would be immobilized, and at that juncture,
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:39.221]  Then Pence would be President, and Paul Ryan would be Vice President.
[02:18:39.221 --> 02:18:40.622]  May God help us.
[02:18:40.622 --> 02:18:43.203]  So, here's the thing.
[02:18:43.203 --> 02:18:47.204]  When I was interviewed by CBN, I put it on there, they never cut it out.
[02:18:47.204 --> 02:18:50.185]  So I thought, I have to go public with it.
[02:18:50.185 --> 02:18:54.447]  And I'm going to meet with the Secret Service and explain what he said.
[02:18:54.447 --> 02:18:56.568]  But he said this was the talk on the Hill.
[02:18:56.568 --> 02:18:59.108]  This is a Congressman that totally loves the President.
[02:18:59.108 --> 02:19:00.509]  He cannot even get to the President.
[02:19:00.589 --> 02:19:04.510]  Because the people around the President are blocking him from even getting to the President.
[02:19:04.510 --> 02:19:05.971]  He wants to help the President.
[02:19:05.971 --> 02:19:07.831]  He wants to help the President's agenda.
[02:19:07.831 --> 02:19:13.953]  But there are people in the Republican Party and the neocons that are doing everything they can.
[02:19:13.953 --> 02:19:15.773]  So the President said, please, can we do this?
[02:19:15.773 --> 02:19:16.754]  Yes, Mr. President, go ahead.
[02:19:16.754 --> 02:19:18.074]  And they do the exact opposite.
[02:19:18.434 --> 02:19:19.715]  So that's the problem.
[02:19:19.715 --> 02:19:21.556]  You know, we have to pray for him.
[02:19:21.556 --> 02:19:26.299]  That's why I launched this 24-hour prayer initiative to pray for the protection of the President.
[02:19:26.299 --> 02:19:28.500]  Because, you know, we don't know.
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:30.641]  This is not how America operates.
[02:19:30.641 --> 02:19:34.303]  You know, we've had a situation whereby John Kennedy was taken out.
[02:19:34.303 --> 02:19:38.025]  And that was because he was going to totally transform the financial system.
[02:19:38.025 --> 02:19:39.146]  And they didn't want that.
[02:19:39.146 --> 02:19:41.427]  Reagan, of course, came out of the blue.
[02:19:41.427 --> 02:19:45.450]  But they put Bush Sr., who was the CIA operative, to watch him.
[02:19:45.450 --> 02:19:47.131]  And he had a bullet fired across his path.
[02:19:47.951 --> 02:19:52.134]  Other than that, all the others, Bush and Clinton, which they are personal friends.
[02:19:52.134 --> 02:19:54.776]  These people have been family friends for years.
[02:19:54.776 --> 02:19:57.497]  And even Obama played into the same narrative.
[02:19:57.497 --> 02:19:59.559]  You can see the dogs of war.
[02:19:59.559 --> 02:20:02.260]  We're in Afghanistan, we're running the opium of the world.
[02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:05.422]  We're in Syria because it's about an oil pipeline.
[02:20:05.422 --> 02:20:10.566]  Because you know how Al-Qaeda is funded out of here by all these foundations.
[02:20:10.566 --> 02:20:12.287]  And Trump just killed that.
[02:20:12.867 --> 02:20:15.028]  President Trump killed that two weeks ago.
[02:20:15.028 --> 02:20:19.010]  He killed NATO and the globalist funding of ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:22.511]  That's why he threatened NATO until they decided to stop funding.
[02:20:22.511 --> 02:20:29.234]  We're ending a Machiavellian evil policy of world enmity and world collapse and world crisis.
[02:20:29.994 --> 02:20:30.295]  I think so.
[02:20:53.413 --> 02:20:58.335]  You know, what's happening currently ties into what Nineveh and Jonah getting their reprieve.
[02:20:58.335 --> 02:21:05.839]  I think that if we don't take this reprieve and really use it, I think we're going to go into serious judgment.
[02:21:05.839 --> 02:21:13.102]  I mean, you're a lot more of a theologian than I. You've traveled the world like probably nobody else has, one of the biggest missionaries out there.
[02:21:13.102 --> 02:21:16.644]  I mean, what is your gut level spiritual discernment on this?
[02:21:17.614 --> 02:21:19.215]  So Alex, we have been praying.
[02:21:19.215 --> 02:21:21.717]  We've had, over the years, all night prayer meetings.
[02:21:21.717 --> 02:21:25.539]  That means people come here and they pray right through the night, just for America.
[02:21:25.539 --> 02:21:27.481]  You see, I came from South Africa.
[02:21:27.481 --> 02:21:28.802]  I became a citizen.
[02:21:28.802 --> 02:21:33.064]  I had to raise my hand to pledge to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:21:33.064 --> 02:21:37.527]  So as a, even though I'm a minister, I have to speak out.
[02:21:37.527 --> 02:21:41.870]  If we, if I don't speak out, I have to renounce my citizenship and leave.
[02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:45.953]  You cannot be American and not do something about what we're facing.
[02:21:45.953 --> 02:21:46.994]  So here's where we are.
[02:21:47.614 --> 02:21:59.508]  God has heard our cry, and as much as some people get all angry that Trump is not the way that they think that he should be, let me tell you, anybody they would put in there would get eaten alive.
[02:21:59.508 --> 02:22:05.415]  God raised up Donald Trump as a wrecking ball to this globalist agenda to destroy America.
[02:22:06.897 --> 02:22:10.179]  We have a window, and we have to move quickly on this.
[02:22:10.179 --> 02:22:11.560]  We cannot sit idly by.
[02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:13.121]  Everybody must be mobilized.
[02:22:13.121 --> 02:22:17.323]  Everybody must speak out, and we have to wake up the population.
[02:22:17.323 --> 02:22:18.544]  Many churches are sleeping.
[02:22:18.544 --> 02:22:19.805]  Pastors are afraid.
[02:22:19.805 --> 02:22:21.326]  They're afraid of losing their time.
[02:22:21.326 --> 02:22:23.747]  They're afraid of losing their 501c3.
[02:22:23.747 --> 02:22:25.068]  Alex, I've said this publicly.
[02:22:25.068 --> 02:22:29.851]  If they want mine, I will take my 501c3, take a jar of Vaseline, and send it to them.
[02:22:29.851 --> 02:22:31.552]  They can use it as a suppository.
[02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:34.152]  We are not going to be quiet.
[02:22:34.152 --> 02:22:35.214]  We're not going to be quiet.
[02:22:35.214 --> 02:22:36.475]  We can't.
[02:22:36.475 --> 02:22:39.919]  The faster I can tell that we both have the same spirit, so does President Trump.
[02:22:39.919 --> 02:22:44.105]  And as you said it, he's stubborn, he hates bullies, he's always hated big banks.
[02:22:44.105 --> 02:22:45.086]  I know you're an expert on that.
[02:22:45.086 --> 02:22:47.168]  And globalists that have tried to push him around.
[02:22:47.168 --> 02:22:48.790]  He is the blue collar billionaire.
[02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:51.393]  So it is that stubbornness that God's using against him.
[02:22:52.694 --> 02:22:56.096]  You said like John the Baptist was pretty stubborn and aggressive and all the rest of it.
[02:22:56.096 --> 02:22:58.198]  But if you look at it, it's absolutely true.
[02:22:58.198 --> 02:23:07.143]  Throughout the Bible and throughout history, God works in mysterious ways and a lot of times raises up somebody who isn't the perfect goody two-shoe to go up against evil.
[02:23:07.143 --> 02:23:08.503]  Can you speak to that?
[02:23:08.503 --> 02:23:11.665]  I know God's spirit has different aspects.
[02:23:11.665 --> 02:23:19.630]  What would you call this spirit of resistance against tyranny that we see that is driving us in our bones to resist and speak out right now?
[02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:22.221]  Well, look at Samson.
[02:23:22.221 --> 02:23:24.802]  What a unique ministry.
[02:23:24.802 --> 02:23:29.524]  I was joking and said he took a jawbone of his mother-in-law and killed a thousand enemies.
[02:23:29.524 --> 02:23:31.404]  But he took a jawbone of a donkey.
[02:23:31.404 --> 02:23:34.326]  Samson was God's deliverer for his people.
[02:23:34.326 --> 02:23:35.706]  I often prayed.
[02:23:35.706 --> 02:23:41.269]  I said, Lord, can't we have a modern day Samson and just send him straight to Washington and just clean house, you know?
[02:23:42.489 --> 02:23:45.970]  Here we are with President Trump, and he understands.
[02:23:45.970 --> 02:23:47.490]  He knows what's going on.
[02:23:47.490 --> 02:23:48.370]  He's not stupid.
[02:23:48.370 --> 02:23:52.231]  The media make him out to be like he doesn't know, but he's very, very sharp.
[02:23:52.231 --> 02:23:57.952]  He knows what's going on, and he also realizes that we have to have divine intervention in America.
[02:23:57.952 --> 02:24:04.333]  Without divine intervention, Alex, we have no hope, because these things have been around for a long, long time.
[02:24:04.333 --> 02:24:09.074]  This is not something that was initiated under the Obama regime or the Bush or the Clinton.
[02:24:09.074 --> 02:24:10.394]  This is something that goes right back
[02:24:10.894 --> 02:24:14.357]  To 1913 at the foundation of the Federal Reserve.
[02:24:14.357 --> 02:24:17.039]  And before that, the Tower of Babel.
[02:24:17.039 --> 02:24:21.322]  And the Tower of Babel in Egypt, always they're trying to set up a one world government.
[02:24:21.322 --> 02:24:22.102]  Totally.
[02:24:22.102 --> 02:24:24.084]  So we are the resistance.
[02:24:24.084 --> 02:24:26.566]  We are the ones that are to stand up.
[02:24:26.566 --> 02:24:30.028]  And I've got ministers saying to me, you're trying to change Bible prophecy.
[02:24:30.028 --> 02:24:32.650]  Don't you know in the end times, the Antichrist will take over?
[02:24:32.650 --> 02:24:36.173]  I said, look, of my dead body, I'm not going to go quietly into history.
[02:24:36.733 --> 02:24:51.461]  I say, how do we live with ourself in eternity when we know, so we get to heaven, we're in heaven, you and me, we're in heaven, and there's Stephen, who was stoned for his faith, and then we have to tap Stephen on the shoulder and say, Stephen, you loved Jesus more than we did.
[02:24:51.461 --> 02:24:52.662]  I couldn't live with myself.
[02:24:52.662 --> 02:24:58.185]  I'd tap him on the shoulder and say, hey Stephen, we loved him equally, but you could never have loved him more than what we did.
[02:24:58.185 --> 02:25:02.448]  The founders... Well of course, and it's these fights, it's these fights that bring out who we really are.
[02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:05.809]  God, this is the fire that tests us.
[02:25:05.809 --> 02:25:06.889]  This is the experience.
[02:25:06.889 --> 02:25:08.029]  This is the boot camp.
[02:25:08.029 --> 02:25:08.769]  This is the test.
[02:25:08.769 --> 02:25:12.190]  And this modern cosmology and churches are just hiding the church.
[02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:13.830]  Thank God they want microchips.
[02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:18.471]  Thank God the child molesters are taking over because wickedness is increasing as in the days of Noah.
[02:25:18.471 --> 02:25:20.212]  That means Jesus is about to come back.
[02:25:20.212 --> 02:25:31.454]  Well, it means as one world government and all this comes in that we're meant to wake as many people up so that they make the right spiritual choice, not just accept it all and let your kids plug into the matrix.
[02:25:32.486 --> 02:25:35.628]  Yeah, and Jesus said, Occupy till I come.
[02:25:35.628 --> 02:25:40.951]  The fact of the matter is that this 56 sign of the Declaration of Independence lost everything.
[02:25:40.951 --> 02:25:50.137]  So with respect to them, as an American, we have to, I don't care who you are, it's got nothing to do with someone saying, well that doesn't involve me.
[02:25:50.137 --> 02:25:51.718]  It involves every single
[02:25:52.578 --> 02:26:00.023]  American, and it's quite crazy that I come from Africa, but I'm more red, white, and blue than a lot of the red, white, and blue.
[02:26:00.023 --> 02:26:02.304]  We have to stand up, and we have to be counted.
[02:26:02.304 --> 02:26:03.265]  We have a window.
[02:26:03.265 --> 02:26:08.308]  Well, that's because you came out of seeing wars and tyranny and manipulation and communism.
[02:26:08.308 --> 02:26:11.490]  I mean, it's the same thing with Eastern Europeans coming in who live under communism.
[02:26:11.490 --> 02:26:16.193]  They appreciate freedom, or folks coming from Africa or wherever, but let's expand on that in the time we have.
[02:26:16.193 --> 02:26:19.175]  Talking to the Congressmen, talking to others, we now have
[02:26:20.162 --> 02:26:27.966]  I don't know if you've seen this, the former head of the CIA saying we need to have basically a military coup against Trump.
[02:26:27.966 --> 02:26:30.307]  He said that three days after your sermon.
[02:26:30.307 --> 02:26:38.131]  So they're now in major publications like Atlantic Monthly actually calling for what you said.
[02:26:38.131 --> 02:26:38.832]  It's ridiculous.
[02:26:39.511 --> 02:26:48.936]  I mean, if people can't see that there's a problem, then they must be that far asleep that they don't realize that that's how far gone we are.
[02:26:48.936 --> 02:26:54.739]  But the very fact that President Trump is in the White House today is a miracle, knowing what I know.
[02:26:54.739 --> 02:26:56.100]  It's a total miracle.
[02:26:56.100 --> 02:26:58.201]  He should never have ever made it.
[02:26:58.661 --> 02:27:03.543]  They wanted one of the other minions in there so they could continue with their agenda.
[02:27:03.543 --> 02:27:11.586]  But God has heard the cry of the church, put him in, and now we must back him, pray for him, stand behind him, and we've got to get up and get mobilized.
[02:27:11.586 --> 02:27:12.787]  Mobilize everybody.
[02:27:12.787 --> 02:27:18.129]  We've got to reach into our inner cities, Alex, because that's the problem where the big melting pot is.
[02:27:18.129 --> 02:27:23.831]  As you know, they've been kept as slaves in the inner city on government aid and support, and we're doing that.
[02:27:23.831 --> 02:27:25.331]  We're bussing people in.
[02:27:25.331 --> 02:27:26.532]  We're doing everything we can.
[02:27:27.012 --> 02:27:27.312]  We're good.
[02:27:45.450 --> 02:27:58.743]  That's why I spoke out, because when I heard that there was a plan to basically immobilize the president, he'd be immobilized, he can't function in office anymore, and the congressman said that's the talk on the Hill.
[02:27:58.743 --> 02:28:00.645]  He didn't say who said, he said that
[02:28:00.965 --> 02:28:02.026]  I want to be specific.
[02:28:02.026 --> 02:28:06.850]  When they say immobilize, they're talking about a COG military overthrow.
[02:28:06.850 --> 02:28:08.692]  Wolf Blitzer says, you mean impeachment?
[02:28:08.692 --> 02:28:12.355]  He goes, no, we're talking about bipartisan bureaucracy doing it.
[02:28:12.355 --> 02:28:14.056]  That is totally illegal.
[02:28:14.056 --> 02:28:15.758]  Trump will resist it.
[02:28:15.758 --> 02:28:18.020]  And believe me, that's just the public cover.
[02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:20.922]  They're getting the public ready for him to be killed.
[02:28:20.922 --> 02:28:22.203]  I want to ask you a question.
[02:28:22.203 --> 02:28:25.026]  Looking at this, they're trying to shut down free speech.
[02:28:25.026 --> 02:28:26.167]  They're going after Christians.
[02:28:26.747 --> 02:28:30.428]  They now realize Trump is standing against that as a last gasp.
[02:28:30.428 --> 02:28:31.549]  That's why they're so desperate.
[02:28:31.549 --> 02:28:39.511]  The churches need to know, at this crossroads, covering their rear ends, not sticking their heads up, they're going to lose everything.
[02:28:39.511 --> 02:28:43.653]  Don't they understand that they're going to lose their free speech if they don't stand up now?
[02:28:44.949 --> 02:28:47.950]  Look, it's like the churches in Germany.
[02:28:47.950 --> 02:28:57.054]  When there were churches near each other and they would come to take the people, to take them to the gas chambers, the other church would sing loud, you know, to drown out the cries.
[02:28:57.054 --> 02:28:59.215]  So, it's always been around.
[02:28:59.215 --> 02:29:01.116]  And you hear the story of the Good Samaritan.
[02:29:01.636 --> 02:29:06.057]  How, you know, the Levite walked by and then the priest walks by.
[02:29:06.057 --> 02:29:16.419]  But it took somebody putting themselves in harm's way to get down off his horse or donkey, whatever he's riding, and then pick him up and take him to the inn.
[02:29:16.419 --> 02:29:19.139]  And so the church should be on that mission.
[02:29:19.139 --> 02:29:25.740]  If you go back and study history, as you have, you see people like Wilberforce that stopped slavery in England.
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:27.320]  These people were counted.
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:30.481]  People like Dr. David Livingston that went to Africa.
[02:29:31.041 --> 02:29:34.202]  And with no radio, television, no cell phone, nothing.
[02:29:34.202 --> 02:29:36.062]  Walking, more by line.
[02:29:36.062 --> 02:29:37.323]  His wife died at 41.
[02:29:37.323 --> 02:29:38.603]  He died at 60.
[02:29:38.603 --> 02:29:41.344]  And these people have impacted history.
[02:29:41.344 --> 02:29:42.264]  We've done tours.
[02:29:42.264 --> 02:29:45.085]  I've gone where David Lennison went.
[02:29:45.085 --> 02:29:46.825]  Pastor, please stay there.
[02:29:46.825 --> 02:29:47.326]  Please stay there.
[02:29:47.326 --> 02:29:51.587]  Do a few more minutes with us just on other big issues you'd like to relay to the listeners and viewers.
[02:29:51.587 --> 02:29:53.287]  It's amazing to have you with us, folks.
[02:29:53.287 --> 02:29:55.088]  They are planning a coup against Trump.
[02:29:55.088 --> 02:29:55.908]  We must raise the alarm.
[02:29:56.482 --> 02:30:00.423]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:00.423 --> 02:30:08.625]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.625 --> 02:30:10.205]  Duty, honor, country.
[02:30:10.205 --> 02:30:16.407]  Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be.
[02:30:16.407 --> 02:30:18.667]  They are your rallying points.
[02:30:18.667 --> 02:30:21.128]  To build courage when courage seems to fail.
[02:30:21.128 --> 02:30:24.669]  To regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith.
[02:30:24.669 --> 02:30:25.949]  To create hope when hope
[02:30:26.109 --> 02:30:27.671]  Becomes forlorn.
[02:30:27.671 --> 02:30:36.623]  Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of dictation, that poetry of imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean.
[02:30:36.623 --> 02:30:41.370]  The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase.
[02:30:41.370 --> 02:30:43.012]  Every demagogue, every cynic
[02:30:43.012 --> 02:30:53.019]  Like every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and I am sorry to say some others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule.
[02:30:53.019 --> 02:30:55.000]  But these are some of the things they do.
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:56.722]  They build your basic character.
[02:30:56.722 --> 02:31:01.265]  They mold you for the future roles as the custodians of the nation's defense.
[02:31:01.265 --> 02:31:05.908]  This was said on May 12, 1962 by General Douglas MacArthur.
[02:31:05.908 --> 02:31:07.990]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:17.415]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:31:17.415 --> 02:31:17.955]  That's right.
[02:31:17.955 --> 02:31:23.218]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.
[02:31:23.218 --> 02:31:29.641]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[02:31:29.881 --> 02:31:37.463]  And let me tell you, son, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[02:31:37.463 --> 02:31:37.723]  Woo!
[02:31:37.723 --> 02:31:38.743]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:31:38.743 --> 02:31:47.486]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[02:33:23.598 --> 02:33:41.692]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:41.692 --> 02:33:44.334]  Pastor Rodney, Howard Brown is our guest.
[02:33:44.334 --> 02:33:45.075]  He'll be gone in about
[02:33:46.232 --> 02:33:47.113]  Ten minutes for Southern.
[02:33:47.113 --> 02:33:55.880]  We're going to talk to Jason in Germany, Natalie in Australia, Megan in Wisconsin, Carlos in Canada, Sean in Oklahoma, and others.
[02:33:55.880 --> 02:33:59.803]  And we'll continue riding shotgun with Owen Troyer.
[02:33:59.803 --> 02:34:02.485]  Coming up in the fourth hour today, we also have another host.
[02:34:02.485 --> 02:34:06.228]  Paul Watson is hosting some of the broadcast tomorrow as well.
[02:34:06.228 --> 02:34:09.011]  I'll be here hosting the main transmission.
[02:34:09.011 --> 02:34:12.634]  Pastor Rodney Howard, we have all these callers from Australia, Germany, you name it.
[02:34:13.735 --> 02:34:17.678]  This is a worldwide awakening to unelected global government.
[02:34:17.678 --> 02:34:24.083]  And I see all the headlines about Trump trying to stop the rule of law and Trump trying to influence his Attorney General.
[02:34:24.083 --> 02:34:25.704]  They're not doing anything to Hillary.
[02:34:25.704 --> 02:34:28.706]  They're not going after any of these big crimes.
[02:34:28.706 --> 02:34:33.070]  And they're arrogantly trying to block the election that we just saw.
[02:34:35.390 --> 02:34:37.171]  You're a smarter guy than I am in many ways.
[02:34:37.171 --> 02:34:43.195]  I mean, I consider and ask questions, but most importantly, what do you want to impart to the listeners and the viewers right now?
[02:34:43.195 --> 02:34:48.718]  What I'm getting from you is basically the same thing I'm feeling in my gut, but also intellectually seeing.
[02:34:48.718 --> 02:34:50.579]  This is such a critical time.
[02:34:50.579 --> 02:34:53.881]  The country and the world's future is on a nice edge.
[02:34:53.881 --> 02:35:03.928]  And if we simply speak out and take action and expose what's happening, which is starting to happen, they won't be able to carry out this coup and will also realize the soft coup
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:18.048]  All the made-up Russiagate, Dragnetzer frauds, and derail that and continue the move to remove the Democrats and Republican establishment people from power peacefully through the electoral process.
[02:35:18.048 --> 02:35:30.115]  My problem is, I see the Democrats and Soros and others openly calling for civil war, openly calling for cop killing, openly calling for destabilization, and at a certain point, the President
[02:35:31.192 --> 02:35:34.114]  Constitutionally needs to move against them.
[02:35:34.114 --> 02:35:35.775]  Now people say, oh, well that's fascism.
[02:35:35.775 --> 02:35:36.556]  No, it's not.
[02:35:36.556 --> 02:35:46.883]  If you have a president with rogue global elements trying to cause civil war, trying to call for coups, it's dereliction of all of our duty if we don't do something.
[02:35:46.883 --> 02:35:48.344]  So we need to spread the word.
[02:35:48.344 --> 02:35:49.345]  We need to expose things.
[02:35:49.345 --> 02:35:54.669]  But what else do we need to impart to listeners and viewers and people about what they need to be doing right now?
[02:35:56.253 --> 02:35:57.675]  Well, of course.
[02:35:57.675 --> 02:36:04.581]  I carry the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, because the only way to change everybody is to get their heart changed.
[02:36:04.581 --> 02:36:07.885]  So that's what we're focusing on 24 hours a day.
[02:36:07.885 --> 02:36:12.709]  But then also to mobilize the people, once they've given their lives to Christ, to be used of God.
[02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:17.153]  And become his hands and feet and his mouth and then be mobilized.
[02:36:17.153 --> 02:36:19.195]  I believe people need to run for office.
[02:36:19.195 --> 02:36:21.037]  People need to get into government.
[02:36:21.037 --> 02:36:26.962]  We started actually in Tampa school of government because and I've got some people that are going to run 2018-2020.
[02:36:26.962 --> 02:36:29.945]  So we cannot be quiet.
[02:36:29.945 --> 02:36:31.486]  We got to be proactive.
[02:36:31.486 --> 02:36:37.451]  If we if the Christian if the godly people do nothing only the wicked will prevail and this thing is is
[02:36:38.152 --> 02:36:44.838]  It was so far gone, if you understand where the President went into the middle of the biggest swamp ever.
[02:36:44.838 --> 02:36:47.441]  And so that's why we have to pray for his protection.
[02:36:47.441 --> 02:36:55.689]  That's why we started our prayer initiative, basically 24-7 prayer around the clock, just for the protection of the President, so that they don't do anything.
[02:36:55.689 --> 02:36:58.752]  You know, I pray over his food, they don't try to poison him or do whatever.
[02:36:59.232 --> 02:37:01.474]  Because, you know, here's the problem.
[02:37:01.474 --> 02:37:03.136]  These people are wicked.
[02:37:03.136 --> 02:37:04.958]  These people are Luciferian.
[02:37:04.958 --> 02:37:07.200]  They worship Lucifer at the highest levels.
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:11.264]  And so, what would stop them from collapsing the dollar?
[02:37:11.264 --> 02:37:13.446]  Plunging America into another Great Depression?
[02:37:13.446 --> 02:37:14.327]  They're already trying!
[02:37:14.927 --> 02:37:15.948]  Well, that's why I'm in Hawaii.
[02:37:40.854 --> 02:37:46.681]  It's because a lot of the elites are moving to Kauai, Zuckerberg and others, and then it's even come out in the newspapers years after.
[02:37:46.681 --> 02:38:01.137]  What I learned from my sources is that even though if there's a breakdown of civilization, it'd be hard to get off the island, they're planning such a big, prolonged civil war based on racial issues and other things, they admit they are in the WikiLeaks, that there might be total breakdown
[02:38:02.307 --> 02:38:03.448]  In many areas.
[02:38:03.448 --> 02:38:12.174]  And I've been looking at Hawaii as a place, if I see the signs to evacuate my family to that's still in the United States, then I would stay in Texas.
[02:38:12.174 --> 02:38:18.699]  It's that bad that I'm actually having to look at evacuation strategies.
[02:38:18.699 --> 02:38:21.461]  And the elites, it's all over the newspaper, are digging in.
[02:38:21.461 --> 02:38:24.223]  They're moving here or they're moving to Tasmania.
[02:38:24.223 --> 02:38:31.508]  And when you see the globalists themselves building armored redoubts in bunkers right here in Kauai,
[02:38:32.648 --> 02:38:36.231]  And planning to basically shut this off if the mainland collapses.
[02:38:36.231 --> 02:38:37.492]  It lets you know what you just said.
[02:38:37.492 --> 02:38:41.355]  These Luciferians started world wars trying to get full control.
[02:38:41.355 --> 02:38:47.980]  They will do anything, but as you said, prayer and connecting to God, they hate that because there's strength in it.
[02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:50.222]  Why is there so much strength in that?
[02:38:50.222 --> 02:38:56.767]  Because obviously God is the creator of heaven and earth, and when we pray, then God gets involved in the affairs of man.
[02:38:58.413 --> 02:39:13.123]  If anybody thinks that it's an accident that President Trump is in the White House and they don't understand the power of God that actually delivered America from a wicked system that was going to be put in place, can you imagine where we would be if Hillary had got in?
[02:39:13.123 --> 02:39:14.464]  Lord have mercy!
[02:39:14.464 --> 02:39:22.049]  I can imagine everything... TPC, carbon taxes, open borders, executive order, gun control, restricting free speech.
[02:39:22.049 --> 02:39:24.130]  They'd announced it all.
[02:39:24.130 --> 02:39:26.092]  Totally, and then we would have been shut down.
[02:39:26.934 --> 02:39:29.135]  Especially me, because I'm very vocal.
[02:39:29.135 --> 02:39:30.696]  And I'm not going to be quiet, Alex.
[02:39:30.696 --> 02:39:31.797]  I mean, I never have.
[02:39:31.797 --> 02:39:32.977]  I was raised as a kid.
[02:39:32.977 --> 02:39:33.678]  That's how I was.
[02:39:33.678 --> 02:39:36.739]  I always got myself into trouble for opening my mouth.
[02:39:36.739 --> 02:39:40.341]  But if I feel something's wrong, I'm going to talk out about it.
[02:39:40.341 --> 02:39:41.762]  And that's just the way it is.
[02:39:41.762 --> 02:39:47.065]  So I want to say to everybody, you know, if you're watching right now and you're not right with God,
[02:39:48.205 --> 02:39:49.266]  Surrender your life to Him.
[02:39:49.266 --> 02:39:50.827]  Say, please use me.
[02:39:50.827 --> 02:39:52.468]  God wants to use you.
[02:39:52.468 --> 02:39:57.510]  Just like He used Moses to deliver God's people out of Egypt, out of bondage.
[02:39:57.510 --> 02:40:01.352]  And Moses only could go once he had that burning bush experience.
[02:40:01.352 --> 02:40:07.876]  So you need to have an encounter with God, where the fire of God comes on you, burns on the inside of you, and then you go.
[02:40:07.876 --> 02:40:10.557]  When you go in His power, it'll be okay.
[02:40:10.557 --> 02:40:11.478]  Nothing will go wrong.
[02:40:11.478 --> 02:40:12.778]  The Lord will protect you.
[02:40:12.778 --> 02:40:13.299]  And then even
[02:40:14.059 --> 02:40:23.207]  If it, as in the case of Stephen, when he was stoned to death, then you go to be with the Lord and you would hear these words, well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of the Lord.
[02:40:23.207 --> 02:40:27.570]  So, really, if you look at it any which way, we win.
[02:40:27.570 --> 02:40:29.051]  We're on the winning side.
[02:40:29.051 --> 02:40:39.380]  And as the Bible tells us... Well, that's my next question, is that, and people ask about Trump's spirituality, I just know people that know him very well, and I've talked to him, and he doesn't do this separately with me.
[02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:41.381]  He knows, you know, that I'm a Christian.
[02:40:42.182 --> 02:40:44.563]  But Trump was raised a Christian.
[02:40:44.563 --> 02:40:46.384]  He didn't like fake preachers, the establishment.
[02:40:46.384 --> 02:40:47.684]  He's not a hypocrite.
[02:40:47.684 --> 02:40:53.406]  But the energy, he feels the spirit when he gets around Christians and evangelicals.
[02:40:53.406 --> 02:41:00.389]  That's why he's constantly wanting them around because it's making his faith that much stronger and you can feel God's spirit.
[02:41:01.189 --> 02:41:03.230]  Coming back into the world so strong right now.
[02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:04.391]  You were just talking about it.
[02:41:04.391 --> 02:41:08.934]  I was getting tears in my eyes because the energy is so powerful.
[02:41:08.934 --> 02:41:16.379]  I just really feel sorry for these Luciferians and devil worshippers that think they're getting power from their God because, I mean, they're not.
[02:41:16.379 --> 02:41:19.221]  They have no idea how powerful God is.
[02:41:19.221 --> 02:41:25.425]  And it's just such a joke once you have discernment that anybody would choose the devil and not God.
[02:41:25.425 --> 02:41:26.586]  It doesn't even make sense.
[02:41:27.338 --> 02:41:46.892]  But the fact of the matter is that, you know, on the inauguration morning, I, along with my wife, my son, my daughter-in-law, and then my son-in-law and daughter, six of us, were privileged to be in the private prayer service with 300 other people right before he would go then to the White House.
[02:41:47.652 --> 02:41:55.083]  And Alex, as we were sitting there, as they began to pray, it was like I saw the hand of God come back on America.
[02:41:55.083 --> 02:41:59.469]  And I saw them as they had the Vice President stand and proclaim over him and pray.
[02:41:59.469 --> 02:42:02.233]  And then they said, Mr. President, would you stand?
[02:42:02.233 --> 02:42:03.475]  I saw him bow his head.
[02:42:04.116 --> 02:42:10.981]  And I said, yes, God is doing a work in our country that the plague is going to be stayed from off the land.
[02:42:10.981 --> 02:42:33.759]  And I believe that there's going to be another great spiritual awakening, like it was in the 1700s with Wesley and Whitfield and Peter Cartwright and Jonathan Edwards, like it was with Charles Finney in the 1800s, that God is going to shake America to the very foundation to call from the White House to every house, from sea to shining sea, from Maine to the Keys to San Diego to Seattle across the great state of Alaska.
[02:42:34.099 --> 02:42:39.001]  The Hawaiian chain, even the island nation of Guam, America, Samoa, and Puerto Rico.
[02:42:39.001 --> 02:42:42.622]  God is not finished with America, and His hand is on this land.
[02:42:42.622 --> 02:42:46.504]  This has been the bread basket for world missions for decades.
[02:42:46.504 --> 02:42:50.205]  Missionaries have been sent out from America to other nations to evangelize.
[02:42:50.205 --> 02:42:53.487]  That's why the enemy wanted to capture it, and let's expand on that.
[02:42:54.187 --> 02:42:59.491]  Because they created their fake churches to demonize it, to try to destroy the spirit.
[02:42:59.491 --> 02:43:04.255]  But I was there an hour before it started because they were blocking people getting in.
[02:43:04.255 --> 02:43:06.456]  You know, as you know, beating them up.
[02:43:06.456 --> 02:43:09.619]  And I started tweeting, he's going to announce
[02:43:10.659 --> 02:43:18.181]  That, you know, we're accepting God back in, we want the birthright, we want that, and that God's in charge, not men.
[02:43:18.181 --> 02:43:28.244]  And I was tweeting it, and after his speech, and an hour and a half later, the New York Times writer came over, and he was watching me, and he wrote a piece about it, and he said, how did you tweak that?
[02:43:28.244 --> 02:43:30.144]  Did you have advanced the speech?
[02:43:30.144 --> 02:43:31.605]  And I said, no.
[02:43:31.605 --> 02:43:38.947]  I literally knew what was going to happen, and that the birthright, and that he was going to announce America's Reborn January
[02:43:40.017 --> 02:43:40.438]  Twenty-fifth.
[02:43:50.911 --> 02:43:56.932]  And the enemy was literally just blocks away howling, screaming, rolling around on the ground so angry.
[02:43:56.932 --> 02:43:57.632]  Why?
[02:43:57.632 --> 02:43:59.272]  Because it's spiritual.
[02:43:59.272 --> 02:44:01.073]  And then you look at the people that protest.
[02:44:01.073 --> 02:44:05.013]  They howl, they scream, they chant, we love Satan.
[02:44:05.013 --> 02:44:08.594]  Everywhere I go, their minions aren't even part of satanic cults.
[02:44:08.594 --> 02:44:17.115]  Women just start chanting it, and men, and it's like, and I thought first they were trying to freak Christians out, but this is what they're, it's a spirit.
[02:44:17.115 --> 02:44:19.256]  And so that was so powerful.
[02:44:19.256 --> 02:44:19.676]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:44:20.476 --> 02:44:26.658]  And even on the hill, I mean, there's people that go to Bohemian Grove, as you know, and worship an owl.
[02:44:26.658 --> 02:44:31.399]  I mean, grown men worshipping an owl and cremating a baby in effigy.
[02:44:31.399 --> 02:44:36.501]  I mean, the fact of the matter is that this thing goes way back, as you said earlier, even to ancient Egypt.
[02:44:36.961 --> 02:44:44.227]  So it's the light and darkness coming against each other, and it's a showdown with Elijah and the prophets of Baal.
[02:44:44.227 --> 02:44:45.829]  And so we have to stand up.
[02:44:45.829 --> 02:44:53.475]  If you remember the story when Elijah, they built the altar and he told them, OK, you call on your God to answer by fire.
[02:44:53.475 --> 02:44:55.757]  And they cried from the morning till noon.
[02:44:55.757 --> 02:44:56.458]  And then they cried.
[02:44:56.838 --> 02:44:59.280]  Until they couldn't cry, they cut themselves with knives.
[02:44:59.280 --> 02:45:01.942]  And then Elijah said, okay, let's rebuild the altar.
[02:45:01.942 --> 02:45:05.004]  And then he said, the God who answers by fire, let him be God.
[02:45:05.004 --> 02:45:07.465]  And he prayed and the fire came down from heaven.
[02:45:07.465 --> 02:45:13.069]  And I just believe with all my heart that the fire of God is upon America.
[02:45:13.069 --> 02:45:19.814]  And we're going to see the greatest awakening that's going to hit our universities, our schools, and even places of government.
[02:45:20.154 --> 02:45:22.716]  And we're going to see people coming back to God.
[02:45:22.716 --> 02:45:25.779]  That this is the final hour, just before Jesus comes.
[02:45:25.779 --> 02:45:29.062]  That the greatest harvest of souls is going to come into the kingdom.
[02:45:29.062 --> 02:45:30.844]  And I believe this with all my heart.
[02:45:30.844 --> 02:45:33.046]  This is what we live for.
[02:45:33.046 --> 02:45:35.348]  And the other, we'll take care of.
[02:45:35.348 --> 02:45:36.108]  But we need to.
[02:45:37.109 --> 02:45:41.492]  Mobilize everybody to shout it from the mountaintops, shout it from the rooftops.
[02:45:41.492 --> 02:45:43.334]  We're not going to hide what God does.
[02:45:43.334 --> 02:45:45.615]  We're not ashamed of the power of God.
[02:45:45.615 --> 02:45:47.076]  The Bible is full of it.
[02:45:47.076 --> 02:45:48.777]  Miracles, signs and wonders.
[02:45:48.777 --> 02:45:56.983]  And yes, there's other people out there that play with it, but I'm telling you right now, God has heard from heaven and he's giving us a last minute reprieve and we need to do something.
[02:45:56.983 --> 02:45:58.444]  And you know, I'm just going to say this.
[02:45:58.444 --> 02:46:05.209]  I know you take a lot of heat and flack, but your voice just pounding the airwaves all these years has woken up many people.
[02:46:05.609 --> 02:46:13.471]  And you know, because I meet people that say we listen to Alex, people get upset because you go over the top, but I go over the top!
[02:46:13.471 --> 02:46:17.832]  When you get mad at something, you can't just sit there and talk just calmly.
[02:46:17.832 --> 02:46:20.033]  You must come with passion.
[02:46:20.033 --> 02:46:27.475]  And so I love your passion, and thank you for talking out and speaking out and shouting it, because there are people, they're listening, and people are listening in other countries.
[02:46:27.475 --> 02:46:32.276]  Well listen, I want to thank you and everybody else, because I know a lot of other pastors, just like you talked about,
[02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:33.677]  I don't know.
[02:46:52.830 --> 02:46:55.051]  But they're doing it, so we have to expose it.
[02:46:55.051 --> 02:46:56.712]  We're not the radicals, they're the radicals.
[02:46:56.712 --> 02:46:59.314]  Pastor, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:46:59.314 --> 02:47:06.037]  How do folks get in contact with you, or watch or listen to your sermons, or find out which town you're coming to next?
[02:47:06.037 --> 02:47:13.361]  Just rebobble.com is our website, and then I have a Rodney L. Brown YouTube channel, and they can follow the link also to our Facebook.
[02:47:13.361 --> 02:47:16.383]  We do much Facebook Live, so that's a way to get a hold of us.
[02:47:17.443 --> 02:47:20.304]  All right, Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown, please join us again very soon.
[02:47:20.304 --> 02:47:21.364]  Thank you, sir.
[02:47:21.364 --> 02:47:22.384]  Anytime, Alex.
[02:47:22.384 --> 02:47:22.984]  Bless you.
[02:47:22.984 --> 02:47:23.424]  There you go.
[02:47:23.424 --> 02:47:27.205]  Well, that's the kind of folks that, you know, are there meeting with Trump and talking to Trump.
[02:47:27.205 --> 02:47:29.566]  And that's what's going on right there.
[02:47:29.566 --> 02:47:35.127]  And he goes and meets with a senior congressman for three hours saying, yeah, they're getting ready to overthrow the president.
[02:47:35.127 --> 02:47:37.228]  Outside of law, that's what's going on.
[02:47:37.228 --> 02:47:43.329]  And now, three days after the pastor warns of it, Brennan climbs out from under a rock with Clapper.
[02:47:44.676 --> 02:47:47.578]  At the Aspen Institute on TV to call for the overthrow.
[02:47:47.578 --> 02:47:48.438]  Owen Schroyer is here.
[02:47:48.438 --> 02:47:52.361]  I want to go to Jason, Natalie, and then who's been on the longest?
[02:47:52.361 --> 02:47:53.341]  Carlos.
[02:47:53.341 --> 02:47:54.022]  Megan hung up.
[02:47:54.022 --> 02:47:54.702]  Megan, sorry.
[02:47:54.702 --> 02:47:55.903]  I had that guest come on.
[02:47:55.903 --> 02:47:57.624]  We'll get your calls right now.
[02:47:57.624 --> 02:48:00.986]  But powerful information right there.
[02:48:00.986 --> 02:48:03.328]  And again, they tell us, oh, don't be Christian or don't talk about your religion.
[02:48:04.554 --> 02:48:07.219]  The globalists are trying to exterminate Christianity worldwide.
[02:48:07.219 --> 02:48:10.785]  They're allied with Islam because they hate real Christianity.
[02:48:10.785 --> 02:48:15.994]  They hate the spirit of it because it's not this crippling, evil, twisted spirit that they worship.
[02:48:17.466 --> 02:48:22.169]  Well, the truth of the matter is the people that protest Trump don't understand the Trump movement.
[02:48:22.169 --> 02:48:24.150]  They've been lied to about the Trump movement.
[02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:27.012]  They've been lied to about what President Trump represents.
[02:48:27.012 --> 02:48:29.673]  So that's why they pick up their signs and they go protest.
[02:48:29.673 --> 02:48:30.774]  I mean, I'm sitting here today.
[02:48:30.774 --> 02:48:39.980]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders just gave a press briefing where she said, I'm the first woman that's also a mother to hold the position of the White House press secretary.
[02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:43.842]  How dare Donald Trump, the misogynist, put this mother to work?
[02:48:43.842 --> 02:48:44.963]  I mean, I can't believe it.
[02:48:44.963 --> 02:48:46.844]  Standing right there beside Betsy DeVos.
[02:48:47.384 --> 02:48:54.568]  So, but they'll pick up their signs and they'll go protest tomorrow, Alex, that Trump is a misogynist, because that's what they do, because that's what the media told them to do.
[02:48:54.568 --> 02:48:57.609]  I don't know what President Trump can do to unite America.
[02:48:57.609 --> 02:49:00.491]  He's done a good job uniting Christians behind him, obviously.
[02:49:00.491 --> 02:49:04.053]  I think the evangelical aspect of America is behind President Trump.
[02:49:04.773 --> 02:49:08.617]  But I don't know if there's anything he can possibly do to extend an olive branch.
[02:49:08.617 --> 02:49:14.583]  I'll tell you this, I'm here in Hawaii and most of the natives I talk to are awake and understand Trump.
[02:49:14.583 --> 02:49:16.345]  People know it's all a scam.
[02:49:16.345 --> 02:49:18.147]  The whole media is demonizing him.
[02:49:18.147 --> 02:49:19.688]  People understand what's going on.
[02:49:19.688 --> 02:49:20.749]  Let's go to a phone call.
[02:49:20.749 --> 02:49:22.691]  Jason in Germany, thanks for holding.
[02:49:22.691 --> 02:49:23.632]  Natalie in Australia.
[02:49:23.632 --> 02:49:24.353]  Jason, you're on the air.
[02:49:27.438 --> 02:49:29.600]  Hey Alex, good to be back on with you.
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:40.330]  Just real quick, you know, the reason why I'm here in Germany, aside from marrying the love of my life, is that I did work for the military in the capacity as a civilian for four years.
[02:49:40.330 --> 02:49:49.158]  I really got to know the families really well and developed a real deep love and appreciation for these people and I really think that we need to do everything within our power to keep
[02:49:50.808 --> 02:50:00.615]  What's developing in the United States from going into some kind of a hot civil war or any other kind of civil emergency collapse of civilization type of thing?
[02:50:00.615 --> 02:50:01.256]  I really do.
[02:50:01.256 --> 02:50:04.438]  Well, these people are so crazy that they're openly trying to start it.
[02:50:04.438 --> 02:50:08.641]  And I just, I mean, I gotta say, Trump needs to just go ahead and cut the cancer out.
[02:50:08.641 --> 02:50:13.044]  I mean, they're saying kill everybody, kill cops, murder Trump, kill everybody, shut down free press.
[02:50:13.044 --> 02:50:18.548]  We need to just announce it, declare they're enemies, and start indicting all of them.
[02:50:18.548 --> 02:50:19.609]  We have to move on them right now.
[02:50:21.550 --> 02:50:22.691]  And Trump's got the backing now.
[02:50:22.691 --> 02:50:27.474]  If he waits, they're gonna kill him.
[02:50:27.474 --> 02:50:33.658]  Yeah, I'd like to know what we can actually do to help him out rather than just making phone calls and protesting.
[02:50:33.658 --> 02:50:46.346]  Well, you need to get a huge buzz going on C-SPAN, talk radio, call Congress, call all over and just point out the martial law, the fact that they're wanting to kill the president, the fact that they work for multinationals that have hijacked the country.
[02:50:46.906 --> 02:50:57.889]  And I think just hammer that truth that they're illegitimate and they're a fraud, that they're trying to block prosperity and freedom, and have double-crossed us with radical orthodox Islam, and that the globalists are trying to collapse Europe and the United States.
[02:50:57.889 --> 02:50:59.489]  Europe's probably already lost.
[02:50:59.489 --> 02:51:01.330]  So this is World War III, folks.
[02:51:01.330 --> 02:51:07.871]  It's a new kind of war, and we've just got to let folks know how high the stakes are, and we've got to get out there in the streets and educate everybody.
[02:51:07.871 --> 02:51:12.812]  A great president once said, the nine most feared words in the English language.
[02:51:12.812 --> 02:51:15.133]  I am from the government and I am here to help.
[02:51:15.493 --> 02:51:18.716]  Adequacy of loss, absorbing capacity.
[02:51:18.716 --> 02:51:19.998]  You call that help?
[02:51:19.998 --> 02:51:22.200]  That's the mandate approved by the G20!
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:24.302]  The banks can steal your money!
[02:51:24.302 --> 02:51:26.464]  Well, they can't steal your gold and silver.
[02:51:26.464 --> 02:51:35.473]  That you fully control, you can have it delivered into an IRA at a depository under lock and key, where you can hide it, where no one can find it, not even your wife!
[02:51:35.473 --> 02:51:35.813]  What?! !
[02:51:36.173 --> 02:51:37.214]  Sorry, honey.

[02:53:14.054 --> 02:53:15.634]  But the symptoms are there.

[02:54:15.143 --> 02:54:18.106]  Alright, I was going to go back to your calls.
[02:54:18.106 --> 02:54:19.487]  I am right here.
[02:54:19.487 --> 02:54:23.371]  Carlos, Sean, Natalie, and Greg here in just a moment.
[02:54:23.371 --> 02:54:25.593]  Owen Schroyer is my guest.
[02:54:25.593 --> 02:54:27.695]  I didn't ask who's host of the fourth hour, sorry.
[02:54:27.695 --> 02:54:30.758]  I'm on quasi-workcation here.
[02:54:30.758 --> 02:54:34.682]  We're going to be airing big... Cernovich, though, he always has big breaking news.
[02:54:34.682 --> 02:54:36.984]  He'll know a lot about what's going on with his sources.
[02:54:36.984 --> 02:54:37.604]  Roger Stone.
[02:54:38.425 --> 02:54:40.806]  I mean, direct high-level White House stuff.
[02:54:40.806 --> 02:54:44.208]  I mean, the stuff you learned yesterday from Roger Stone is directly what's happening.
[02:54:44.208 --> 02:54:47.910]  Trump knows they're moving against him, and he just can't believe nobody will stand up.
[02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:49.410]  But again, a lot of people want to hedge their bets.
[02:54:49.410 --> 02:54:53.913]  People have been so comfortable in D.C., even if they're patriots overall, they're just not
[02:54:54.753 --> 02:55:05.649]  Folks for action because this country's ever faced a bunch of crazy Democrats, offshore banks, and Lloyd Blankfein making fun of our infrastructure and saying I'm moving everything to China, screw you America, in tweets.
[02:55:05.649 --> 02:55:08.433]  I mean, it's just these people are such a-holes.
[02:55:09.448 --> 02:55:13.051]  I mean, I'm sorry, they're just jerks out to get us, man.
[02:55:13.051 --> 02:55:14.352]  They're evil.
[02:55:14.352 --> 02:55:15.933]  And it just comes down to that.
[02:55:15.933 --> 02:55:18.915]  They're allied with everything you can imagine that's bad news.
[02:55:18.915 --> 02:55:21.557]  So, please financially support us.
[02:55:21.557 --> 02:55:24.078]  We've got great products everybody needs, so it's a win-win.
[02:55:24.078 --> 02:55:25.860]  We're going to end this free shipping this week.
[02:55:26.988 --> 02:55:27.448]  We're good to go.
[02:55:49.901 --> 02:55:56.648]  Quite frankly, let's just say libido-wise, it's got a little bit more of several of the ingredients that are cold-pressed.
[02:55:56.648 --> 02:55:57.569]  Anthroplex is great.
[02:55:57.569 --> 02:56:00.392]  It's a dry version of it, but it's 57% off.
[02:56:00.392 --> 02:56:01.993]  Silver Bullet, 66% off.
[02:56:01.993 --> 02:56:03.355]  Again, never done that.
[02:56:03.355 --> 02:56:06.358]  Strawberry Caveman, new flavor, and the great bone broth turmeric.
[02:56:06.838 --> 02:56:07.338]  I think so.
[02:56:27.168 --> 02:56:27.468]  Thank you.
[02:56:53.579 --> 02:56:56.881]  Alex, I just want to say a few quick points and then something about Nathan Iodine.
[02:56:56.881 --> 02:56:59.863]  President Trump, could you surround yourself with loyal men like Alan West?
[02:56:59.863 --> 02:57:01.324]  He is a great guy.
[02:57:20.003 --> 02:57:20.143]  Yes.
[02:57:36.861 --> 02:57:38.843]  And that gave me two more years with him.
[02:57:38.843 --> 02:57:40.804]  And I want to thank you for your product.
[02:57:40.804 --> 02:57:42.205]  And I think it's a wonderful product.
[02:57:42.205 --> 02:57:43.546]  It does work.
[02:57:43.546 --> 02:57:45.908]  And, you know, the elite can have Tasmania.
[02:57:45.908 --> 02:57:47.969]  That's full of spiders and everything.
[02:57:47.969 --> 02:57:49.250]  They can live there all they want.
[02:57:49.250 --> 02:57:50.911]  It's a boring place.
[02:57:50.911 --> 02:57:51.672]  And just
[02:57:51.997 --> 02:57:52.597]  Thank you guys.
[02:57:52.597 --> 02:57:55.259]  I know I was going to say something else, but I'm a little nervous, so thank you guys.
[02:57:55.259 --> 02:58:00.802]  Well, notice how the elite are putting themselves in their own super remote prisons.
[02:58:00.802 --> 02:58:03.783]  And it just shows they took over the world, but now they're not safe anywhere.
[02:58:03.783 --> 02:58:11.047]  And they want to bring from failed Muslim states tens of millions of people that wipe their butts with their hands, man.
[02:58:11.047 --> 02:58:16.530]  I mean, it's like, what level have we reached here of the globalists?
[02:58:16.530 --> 02:58:18.351]  And meanwhile, Zuckerberg's trying to move to Kauai.
[02:58:18.351 --> 02:58:20.672]  The locals don't want him and are trying to run him out.
[02:58:20.672 --> 02:58:21.253]  What do you make of that?
[02:58:24.744 --> 02:58:26.665]  Good on them for standing up for themselves.
[02:58:26.665 --> 02:58:28.645]  God bless them all.
[02:58:28.645 --> 02:58:31.886]  Well, Natalie, I want to ask you one question about Australia.
[02:58:31.886 --> 02:58:33.207]  So we're back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:33.207 --> 02:58:33.967]  Stay there, don't hang out.
[02:58:33.967 --> 02:58:36.268]  I'm going to go to Greg, Carlos, Sean and others.
[02:58:36.268 --> 02:58:37.708]  We're going to find out what Cernovich has got.
[02:58:37.708 --> 02:58:38.708]  He's always got key intel.
[02:58:38.708 --> 02:58:43.370]  Hell, they even admit in Foreign Affairs and stuff that he knows where they eat lunch and what they're doing.
[02:58:43.370 --> 02:58:44.950]  They're wondering where he gets his intel.
[02:58:44.950 --> 02:58:46.191]  Gee, where do you think?
[02:58:46.191 --> 02:58:46.931]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:46.931 --> 02:58:47.911]  You guys want to fight?
[02:58:47.911 --> 02:58:48.452]  You got one.
[02:58:48.452 --> 02:58:49.672]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:50.886 --> 02:58:52.890]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:57.856 --> 02:59:04.440]  Today I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[02:59:04.440 --> 02:59:13.324]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[02:59:13.324 --> 02:59:20.989]  When it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[02:59:20.989 --> 02:59:27.132]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[02:59:27.472 --> 02:59:30.515]  NAR Lipoic Acid, Bio-PQQ and many others.
[02:59:30.515 --> 02:59:35.218]  Bio-PQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[02:59:35.218 --> 02:59:39.001]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[02:59:39.001 --> 02:59:41.724]  Visit Infowarslife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[02:59:41.724 --> 02:59:49.870]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party certified review agency, Power Review.
[02:59:49.870 --> 02:59:55.435]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com before it sells out again.
[02:59:55.435 --> 02:59:56.576]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:59.500 --> 03:00:03.163]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.163 --> 03:00:14.350]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:14.350 --> 03:00:19.474]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:22.156 --> 03:00:23.677]  Alright, Natalie's in Australia.
[03:00:23.677 --> 03:00:37.205]  Natalie, I know you're new Prime Minister in permit or whatever, but I know you guys have started cutting back your carbon taxes, reportedly not just completely flooding your country with folks that won't assimilate.
[03:00:37.205 --> 03:00:41.448]  I mean, how would you say, as an Australian overall, the awakening's happening there?
[03:00:41.448 --> 03:00:46.711]  Because it looks like you guys have turned the corner a little bit, or am I wrong?
[03:00:46.711 --> 03:00:51.094]  Well, my dad was complaining about a billion dollar
[03:00:52.007 --> 03:00:57.488]  Well that's good because all over the world there's awakenings happening and again we're not saying Trump's the end-all be-all.
[03:00:57.488 --> 03:01:01.329]  He's just trying to return power back to the people and they're panicking.
[03:01:01.329 --> 03:01:03.650]  I'm just concerned because I don't think the globalists realize
[03:01:21.769 --> 03:01:27.193]  They realize they're in trouble, but they're still arrogant and they still keep doing stuff and failing as they escalate.
[03:01:27.193 --> 03:01:29.175]  And then now all they've got left is killing Trump.
[03:01:29.175 --> 03:01:36.241]  And I don't see, you know, Brennan's up there saying, let's all be nice once this happens and just nobody resists.
[03:01:36.241 --> 03:01:37.782]  Let's not tear up the country.
[03:01:37.782 --> 03:01:39.684]  What does he think is going to happen?
[03:01:39.684 --> 03:01:40.544]  I mean, he's crazy.
[03:01:40.544 --> 03:01:41.025]  What do you think?
[03:01:42.853 --> 03:01:49.597]  Well, all I know is without America, Australia would not be in a good situation with China or anything like that.
[03:01:49.597 --> 03:01:52.459]  Because I've heard stories before, like people in the army and that.
[03:01:52.887 --> 03:01:55.269]  That China would love Australia.
[03:02:13.367 --> 03:02:19.893]  We'll talk about implementing COG with Sean Carlos.
[03:02:19.893 --> 03:02:20.914]  Clapper lied to Congress.
[03:02:20.914 --> 03:02:21.674]  Yeah, we've got the clip.
[03:02:21.674 --> 03:02:22.635]  We ought to pull it up.
[03:02:22.635 --> 03:02:27.479]  Greg, we need for prayer.
[03:02:27.479 --> 03:02:32.403]  Also, I want to play the compilation again of all the talk of martial law and coup.
[03:02:32.403 --> 03:02:34.284]  The good news is we exposed it.
[03:02:34.284 --> 03:02:36.326]  Now they're having to admit it.
[03:02:36.326 --> 03:02:37.427]  Let's see.
[03:02:37.427 --> 03:02:39.689]  They don't want us to expose it and have a consensus it's wrong.
[03:02:40.489 --> 03:02:43.831]  They're being forced to admit they're planning it now because we're exposing it.
[03:02:43.831 --> 03:02:47.273]  And I told you, the victory is getting everybody to talk about it.
[03:02:47.273 --> 03:02:48.654]  You did that, listeners.
[03:02:48.654 --> 03:02:49.935]  Now it's everywhere.
[03:02:49.935 --> 03:02:53.017]  In Congress, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, everywhere.
[03:02:53.017 --> 03:02:55.079]  We forced it through again.
[03:02:55.079 --> 03:02:55.599]  You did it.
[03:02:55.599 --> 03:02:56.600]  You get the credit.
[03:02:56.600 --> 03:02:58.561]  God bless you.
[03:02:58.561 --> 03:03:00.002]  Owen Schroer, comments on what we've been doing.
[03:03:01.297 --> 03:03:03.899]  Well, we're trying to change the narrative, Alex.
[03:03:03.899 --> 03:03:04.839]  We're the media now.
[03:03:04.839 --> 03:03:08.002]  I mean, people want to look at you and they want to say Alex Jones is crazy.
[03:03:08.002 --> 03:03:09.903]  They want to make fun of you on Comedy Central.
[03:03:09.903 --> 03:03:14.686]  But the truth is, that's their psychological reaction of denial.
[03:03:14.686 --> 03:03:17.928]  They can't accept the fact that you can control the narrative now.
[03:03:17.928 --> 03:03:21.090]  They can't accept the fact that InfoWarriors can control the narrative.
[03:03:21.090 --> 03:03:25.813]  That InfoWarriors can decide the results of a presidential election.
[03:03:25.813 --> 03:03:26.714]  That scares them.
[03:03:26.714 --> 03:03:27.735]  They're in denial of that.
[03:03:27.735 --> 03:03:30.577]  So they point at you, they laugh, and ultimately,
[03:03:31.377 --> 03:03:42.563]  They're only going to hurt themselves, because instead of trying to recapture the hearts and minds of America that you've stolen from them, that they stole originally, they're just trying to point and laugh at you.
[03:03:42.563 --> 03:03:43.263]  So that's fine.
[03:03:43.263 --> 03:03:44.243]  They can point and laugh at you.
[03:03:44.243 --> 03:03:50.266]  We're going to continue to change hearts and minds, and we're going to continue to get our agenda through.
[03:03:50.266 --> 03:03:52.447]  And it's tough for Donald Trump.
[03:03:52.447 --> 03:03:56.449]  I think that he's dealing with people that maybe they're scared, maybe they're getting death-threatened right now.
[03:03:58.010 --> 03:03:58.771]  Well, we know.
[03:03:58.771 --> 03:04:00.832]  They're in the news saying kill his cabinet.
[03:04:00.832 --> 03:04:03.974]  I mean, the death threats are a given.
[03:04:03.974 --> 03:04:13.459]  I'll be interested to hear what Mike Cernovich wants to talk about here coming up in just a couple minutes, especially considering all the double standards that we're seeing out of liberals.
[03:04:13.459 --> 03:04:14.100]  It's hilarious.
[03:04:14.100 --> 03:04:18.462]  They don't care about Boy Scouts or the military until Trump actually does something about it.
[03:04:18.462 --> 03:04:20.003]  Now, all of a sudden, they care about the Boy Scouts.
[03:04:20.003 --> 03:04:22.105]  Now, all of a sudden, they care about the military.
[03:04:22.105 --> 03:04:23.025]  You've got the Obamacare.
[03:04:23.025 --> 03:04:25.607]  Well, now they're calling the Boy Scouts racist and fascist.
[03:04:26.365 --> 03:04:29.127]  I mean, it's total race-baiting garbage.
[03:04:29.127 --> 03:04:30.649]  They're a total joke.
[03:04:30.649 --> 03:04:36.173]  And the good news is they're so arrogant they're keeping Pelosi and Schumer and Hillary as the leadership.
[03:04:36.173 --> 03:04:36.794]  And look at Pelosi.
[03:04:36.794 --> 03:04:38.015]  We're going to go to the break.
[03:04:38.015 --> 03:04:38.896]  Alex, look at Pelosi.
[03:04:38.896 --> 03:04:41.518]  She said she's never heard of Imran Awan.
[03:04:41.518 --> 03:04:42.439]  This woman lied.
[03:04:42.439 --> 03:04:45.181]  She said she'd never heard of Imran Aram.
[03:04:45.181 --> 03:04:47.383]  He handled her iPad.
[03:04:47.383 --> 03:04:48.264]  It was in the WikiLeaks.
[03:04:48.264 --> 03:04:50.766]  This woman is a known liar.
[03:04:50.766 --> 03:04:51.867]  Oh, really?
[03:04:51.867 --> 03:04:53.028]  Nancy Pelosi's a liar?
[03:04:54.834 --> 03:04:57.837]  Oh, and Schroyer, I tell you.
[03:04:57.837 --> 03:04:59.659]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:59.659 --> 03:05:05.224]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, and Mike Cernovich is coming up with your phone calls and more.
[03:05:05.224 --> 03:05:05.605]  Stay with us.
[03:05:07.907 --> 03:05:16.792]  After speaking with his military staff, President Trump has banned transgenders from the military, citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons.
[03:05:16.792 --> 03:05:22.956]  His decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another.
[03:05:22.956 --> 03:05:27.379]  In other news, President Trump also publicly blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not replacing
[03:05:27.679 --> 03:05:28.319]  We're good to go!
[03:05:49.909 --> 03:05:53.190]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:06:12.697 --> 03:06:25.646]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:06:25.646 --> 03:06:32.211]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:06:32.211 --> 03:06:34.693]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[03:06:34.753 --> 03:06:45.978]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:06:45.978 --> 03:06:48.319]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[03:06:48.319 --> 03:06:49.799]  We're getting results.
[03:06:49.799 --> 03:06:55.762]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[03:06:55.902 --> 03:06:58.784]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[03:06:58.784 --> 03:07:08.011]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:07:08.011 --> 03:07:16.258]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[03:07:16.258 --> 03:07:17.479]  A 360 win.
[03:07:17.479 --> 03:07:20.981]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off.
[03:07:22.122 --> 03:07:24.044]  On your order at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:07:24.044 --> 03:07:31.972]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:07:31.972 --> 03:07:37.057]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:07:37.057 --> 03:07:43.163]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:07:43.163 --> 03:07:44.544]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:07:44.784 --> 03:07:46.765]  Select your favorite product or products.
[03:07:46.765 --> 03:07:50.926]  Click on AutoShip and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:07:50.926 --> 03:07:53.327]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win.
[03:07:53.327 --> 03:07:57.808]  And with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:07:57.808 --> 03:07:59.108]  10% off on AutoShip.
[03:07:59.108 --> 03:08:01.549]  Win, win, win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:08:01.549 --> 03:08:03.530]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[03:08:03.530 --> 03:08:07.391]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:08:14.426 --> 03:08:19.469]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:08:19.469 --> 03:08:27.294]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:27.294 --> 03:08:30.737]  Ladies and gentlemen, wanted to hand the baton to the one and only Mike Cernovich.
[03:08:31.650 --> 03:08:32.931]  We're coming up in early September.
[03:08:32.931 --> 03:08:38.214]  He's going to start hosting his own transmission with, of course, Owen Schroyer.
[03:08:38.214 --> 03:08:39.035]  That is coming up.
[03:08:39.035 --> 03:08:43.638]  That kicks off in early September, but here he is once a week hosting an hour.
[03:08:43.638 --> 03:08:45.839]  I want to just get out of here and let him take over.
[03:08:45.839 --> 03:08:51.923]  I know we've got Carlos in Canada and Greg in Montana and Sean wants to talk about implementing COG from Oklahoma.
[03:08:52.463 --> 03:08:57.026]  Carol in Florida wants to talk about coup and the Senate Bill 722.
[03:08:57.026 --> 03:09:02.369]  Dr. Kelly, California, wants to talk about Senator and Congress.
[03:09:02.369 --> 03:09:04.351]  He's listening on 1490 AM.
[03:09:04.351 --> 03:09:07.773]  K-O-W-I or L. We've got two affiliates there.
[03:09:07.773 --> 03:09:09.834]  That's in Santa Cruz.
[03:09:09.834 --> 03:09:11.335]  We've got like seven or nine.
[03:09:11.335 --> 03:09:12.116]  We've got more.
[03:09:12.116 --> 03:09:13.737]  I think it's like ten affiliates down in California.
[03:09:13.737 --> 03:09:16.438]  The show's really growing out there, so that's a blessing.
[03:09:16.438 --> 03:09:19.580]  Too bad the globalists have pretty much completely taken over California, but who knows?
[03:09:19.580 --> 03:09:21.642]  Just like the White House, maybe we can take it back.
[03:09:22.591 --> 03:09:32.156]  But going back now to the main issue, we have a major pastor coming out who met with Trump and met with senior members of Congress saying they've been told a plan for martial law.
[03:09:32.156 --> 03:09:33.437]  Well, that's already in the news.
[03:09:33.437 --> 03:09:45.644]  Then we have Brennan coming out yesterday at the Aspen Institute with Clapper, former head of all intelligence, the national security system, and then we've got
[03:09:48.581 --> 03:09:50.982]  Blitzer on there saying, well, you know, you got to impeach him, right?
[03:09:50.982 --> 03:09:54.164]  He goes, no, we're just removing a coup.
[03:09:54.164 --> 03:10:02.009]  So this is huge now to have them admit all this with a new Comedy Central show announced to come on after
[03:10:03.439 --> 03:10:04.039]  Alex Jones Show!
[03:10:33.620 --> 03:10:35.630]  That that actually gets them ratings.
[03:10:35.630 --> 03:10:37.822]  Just imitating us and then twisting it.
[03:10:38.885 --> 03:10:53.188]  So they plan to destroy who we are by posing as us and then going out and committing cultural crimes while hiding behind the thing that they're just actors, they're just comedians with a bunch of writers in New York City and L.A.
[03:10:53.188 --> 03:11:00.569]  sitting there writing garbage to then put it into an actor's mouth who's posing as a fake newsman who's posing as me.
[03:11:00.569 --> 03:11:04.110]  So if Tuck Buckford wasn't enough, now you're gonna get five nights a week
[03:11:04.770 --> 03:11:11.997]  Attacking yours truly and they even admit it's supposed to be Alex Jones So it's not enough to have all these movies.
[03:11:11.997 --> 03:11:17.101]  They've made and homeland and all these shows now I'm so evil.
[03:11:17.101 --> 03:11:24.288]  I've got to be demonized nightly on a Rated Comedy Central show there's nobody watches the news anymore.
[03:11:24.288 --> 03:11:25.769]  Nobody watches mainstream news.
[03:11:25.769 --> 03:11:27.791]  So now they're going totally to
[03:11:28.908 --> 03:11:29.428]  Comedy.
[03:11:29.428 --> 03:11:35.213]  And you go to CNN, most of the videos you see on there many times are Saturday Night Live or Colbert.
[03:11:35.213 --> 03:11:36.694]  Again, misrepresenting.
[03:11:36.694 --> 03:11:37.715]  Remember Alec Baldwin?
[03:11:37.715 --> 03:11:39.737]  I don't like black people.
[03:11:39.737 --> 03:11:40.757]  I'm Donald Trump.
[03:11:40.757 --> 03:11:43.400]  I learned to be racist from Alex Jones.
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:45.341]  InfoWars, it's a show.
[03:11:45.341 --> 03:11:46.602]  I learned it from him.
[03:11:46.602 --> 03:11:47.763]  We're racist.
[03:11:47.763 --> 03:11:51.946]  Black people aren't humans.
[03:11:51.946 --> 03:11:53.648]  I mean that, I never said that.
[03:11:55.242 --> 03:11:58.644]  Alec Baldwin played Trump and then said, Alex Jones told me!
[03:11:58.644 --> 03:12:00.205]  Alex Jones told me!
[03:12:00.205 --> 03:12:02.907]  And then that's the new thing.
[03:12:02.907 --> 03:12:05.569]  It shows the desperateness of these people.
[03:12:06.533 --> 03:12:13.595]  But it's better Google, Facebook, Twitter start to censor us, start to block us, start to try to stop you from getting our information and admit they are.
[03:12:13.595 --> 03:12:20.998]  And Cernovich gets the secret documents and Google admits they're real where they spent millions hiring people to delist us on Google.
[03:12:20.998 --> 03:12:26.740]  But when they got exposed we went back to the top because Google had to pull it because it's racketeering.
[03:12:26.740 --> 03:12:28.040]  It's criminal.
[03:12:28.040 --> 03:12:30.141]  It's a trust operation.
[03:12:30.141 --> 03:12:31.681]  It's a monopoly operation.
[03:12:31.681 --> 03:12:33.622]  They've just been fined hundreds of millions for that.
[03:12:34.744 --> 03:12:39.007]  So, they attacked us, we fought back, they had to back off, but it's happening.
[03:12:39.007 --> 03:12:41.309]  But Google doesn't have as bad as Facebook or Twitter.
[03:12:41.309 --> 03:12:42.830]  They go, oh, well that's their own platforms.
[03:12:42.830 --> 03:12:52.696]  No, they advertise it as open for political discussion, then they censor us, then they have bots going around acting like they're liberals, attacking everybody to make us feel demoralized and alone.
[03:12:52.696 --> 03:12:53.177]  It's a hoax.
[03:12:54.753 --> 03:13:02.961]  But again, they want to silence us, then build facsimiles of who we are, then build straw men, and then demonize the straw man in the public.
[03:13:02.961 --> 03:13:07.947]  Gag the real person, the body stature gets rid of the real person before it copies itself.
[03:13:07.947 --> 03:13:08.988]  Okay?
[03:13:08.988 --> 03:13:10.129]  Well, that's not happening.
[03:13:10.129 --> 03:13:12.491]  They created Glenn Beck to doppelganger.
[03:13:12.491 --> 03:13:13.172]  Didn't work.
[03:13:13.172 --> 03:13:15.895]  He went down, not me, because you couldn't get rid of me.
[03:13:15.895 --> 03:13:17.056]  So thanks for the prayers.
[03:13:17.056 --> 03:13:17.817]  Thanks for the support.
[03:13:19.366 --> 03:13:36.402]  It's all of you making this possible, but your investment spreading the word on InfoWars, your investment supporting us, your investment defending us, your investment getting past the peer pressure and the mind control is delivering with President Trump, delivering in the huge Freedom Caucus, close to taking over the House from the Republicans.
[03:13:36.402 --> 03:13:41.187]  We've taken it from the Democrats, now in 2018 we're going to take it from the neocons and the rhinos.
[03:13:41.187 --> 03:13:42.328]  We're this close.
[03:13:43.493 --> 03:13:45.394]  To really restoring the Republic.
[03:13:45.394 --> 03:13:48.056]  And having a true future.
[03:13:48.056 --> 03:13:49.277]  Thanks to all of you.
[03:13:49.277 --> 03:13:50.598]  So stop thanking me.
[03:13:50.598 --> 03:13:51.659]  Stop thanking Cernovich.
[03:13:51.659 --> 03:13:52.940]  We're in this with you.
[03:13:52.940 --> 03:13:53.861]  It's a fight.
[03:13:53.861 --> 03:13:55.382]  We know the enemy hates us.
[03:13:55.382 --> 03:13:56.343]  What do you expect us to do?
[03:13:56.343 --> 03:13:59.865]  Roll over to a bunch of scum that hate our guts and want to make us slaves?
[03:13:59.865 --> 03:14:01.386]  Okay, this is normal behavior.
[03:14:01.386 --> 03:14:03.908]  They take normal behavior and make it look weird.
[03:14:03.908 --> 03:14:05.449]  Let them have a bunch of Comedy Central.
[03:14:05.449 --> 03:14:08.932]  We're not in third grade where you laugh at somebody and they go cry to mommy.
[03:14:08.932 --> 03:14:10.513]  We love scum hating us.
[03:14:10.513 --> 03:14:12.134]  We love scum attacking us.
[03:14:12.134 --> 03:14:12.555]  We love it!
[03:14:14.070 --> 03:14:16.332]  We absolutely love it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:14:16.332 --> 03:14:19.135]  And we're done playing games, and we're not backing down.
[03:14:19.135 --> 03:14:20.035]  So that's the end of it.
[03:14:20.035 --> 03:14:22.458]  But we've got free shipping until the end of the month.
[03:14:22.458 --> 03:14:23.959]  Just a few days left.
[03:14:23.959 --> 03:14:25.380]  Four or five days left.
[03:14:25.380 --> 03:14:28.343]  And we've got 57% off of Super Female Vitality.
[03:14:28.343 --> 03:14:29.224]  Never done that.
[03:14:29.224 --> 03:14:30.845]  Silver Bullet, 66% off.
[03:14:30.845 --> 03:14:33.527]  Never done that, because I just want everybody to have this and try it.
[03:14:33.527 --> 03:14:34.969]  Caveman, strawberries in, 25% off.
[03:14:34.969 --> 03:14:35.869]  25% off on the chocolate.
[03:14:37.833 --> 03:14:38.153]  Thank you.
[03:14:52.967 --> 03:14:57.632]  ProPure, amazing traveler, gravity fed, blows away much of the competition.
[03:14:57.632 --> 03:14:59.234]  The very best is ProPure and AlexaPure.
[03:14:59.234 --> 03:15:01.756]  They're apples and oranges, but all the other stuff's nothing compared to those.
[03:15:01.756 --> 03:15:04.679]  It's the best unit, 30% off, $132.
[03:15:04.679 --> 03:15:10.085]  People are selling other stainless steel systems for $250 that are basically aren't even as good as this unit.
[03:15:10.085 --> 03:15:11.086]  $132, nobody can top it.
[03:15:11.086 --> 03:15:13.329]  ProPure, traveler, AlexaPure breeze.
[03:15:13.749 --> 03:15:14.210]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:15:34.013 --> 03:15:39.295]  Twenty percent off InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:15:39.295 --> 03:15:40.496]  Take advantage of it all.
[03:15:40.496 --> 03:15:41.777]  Support the broadcast.
[03:15:41.777 --> 03:15:43.517]  Mike Cernovich, thank you for hosting.
[03:15:43.517 --> 03:15:51.261]  We're going to skip this break so you have more time here, and we're going to skip the break at the 50 so you get back the six, seven minutes I've taken from you.
[03:15:51.261 --> 03:15:52.601]  We salute your work.
[03:15:52.601 --> 03:15:55.903]  I've seen your reach on Facebook go from 10 million a week to 35 million a week.
[03:15:56.383 --> 03:15:58.264]  Despite the fact they're trying to censor you.
[03:15:58.264 --> 03:16:00.224]  That's on Facebook what we do every week now.
[03:16:00.224 --> 03:16:02.965]  So we want to salute Mike Cernovich and all the work he's doing.
[03:16:02.965 --> 03:16:06.307]  To see your explosion is absolutely vitriolic.
[03:16:06.307 --> 03:16:08.087]  So we salute you, Mike Cernovich!
[03:16:08.087 --> 03:16:09.068]  Mike, take over!
[03:16:09.068 --> 03:16:11.569]  But what do you make of the open martial law coup plans?
[03:16:11.569 --> 03:16:13.009]  We forced it out in the open.
[03:16:13.009 --> 03:16:14.890]  Another devastating blow to the enemy.
[03:16:14.890 --> 03:16:16.831]  They can't organize it in secret anymore.
[03:16:16.831 --> 03:16:18.391]  We savaged them, Cernovich!
[03:16:18.391 --> 03:16:20.172]  And we're going to push their timetable up.
[03:16:20.172 --> 03:16:23.173]  And they're going to make a move and they're going to fail and we're going to arrest all their asses.
[03:16:23.373 --> 03:16:26.722]  And after they're absolutely convicted, we're gonna hang their asses high.
[03:16:26.722 --> 03:16:27.705]  Mike Cernovich, take over.
[03:16:28.581 --> 03:16:30.582]  Yeah, I mean, it's an amazing time, Alex.
[03:16:30.582 --> 03:16:33.003]  We always have a lot of great news.
[03:16:33.003 --> 03:16:39.966]  Of course, Scaramucci, as I said and as you said, has been a tremendous asset already to the Trump administration.
[03:16:39.966 --> 03:16:43.307]  He went on the record today contradicting H.R.
[03:16:43.307 --> 03:16:44.047]  McMaster.
[03:16:44.047 --> 03:16:49.329]  It admitted what we knew, which is that McMaster has Obama holdovers.
[03:16:49.329 --> 03:16:52.150]  The Obama holdovers are leaking to the media.
[03:16:52.150 --> 03:16:55.532]  So if you'll remember, this is a very, very important development and I'll explain why.
[03:16:56.132 --> 03:17:04.219]  Scaramucci, or Mooch, as people affectionately refer to him as, who's a self-made billionaire, by the way, and yet people, of course, hate on him.
[03:17:04.219 --> 03:17:05.100]  They hate success.
[03:17:05.100 --> 03:17:06.461]  It's amazing.
[03:17:06.461 --> 03:17:11.185]  So he went on today and said that the Obama holdovers are leaking to the media.
[03:17:11.926 --> 03:17:14.567]  Well, if you go back a week or two ago, H.R.
[03:17:14.567 --> 03:17:37.857]  McMaster held a town hall meeting, and this is proof Eli Lakin Bloomberg said it, therefore it has to be true, because as you know, I mean, if you and I say it isn't true, but if Bloomberg, you know, if it's Bloomberg, then it must be true, you know, because even though it takes them weeks to catch up to us, McMaster held a town hall where he said there's no such thing as an Obama holdover.
[03:17:38.769 --> 03:17:40.610]  So today, this is a very subtle thing.
[03:17:40.610 --> 03:17:47.435]  Very few people understand this and almost nobody in the media does because they don't have my information and my sources and everything.
[03:17:47.435 --> 03:17:52.719]  This is a sign that they know McMaster is a problem.
[03:17:52.719 --> 03:17:55.101]  McMaster is definitely on his way out.
[03:17:55.101 --> 03:17:56.903]  So McMaster had held the town hall.
[03:17:57.722 --> 03:17:59.183]  To address Mike Cernovich's tweets.
[03:17:59.183 --> 03:17:59.883]  This is a fact.
[03:17:59.883 --> 03:18:01.104]  I didn't make this up.
[03:18:01.104 --> 03:18:03.726]  People go, oh, Cernovich, you self-promote or whatever.
[03:18:03.726 --> 03:18:09.310]  This is Eli Lake, who went on to a podcast and called me a conspiracy theorist.
[03:18:09.310 --> 03:18:11.371]  So Eli Lake is definitely not a friend of mine.
[03:18:11.371 --> 03:18:13.753]  He's not trying to do me any favors.
[03:18:13.753 --> 03:18:16.355]  And he said that at a town hall, H.R.
[03:18:16.355 --> 03:18:19.657]  McMaster said, there's no such thing as an Obama holdover.
[03:18:19.657 --> 03:18:20.858]  What a joke, right?
[03:18:20.858 --> 03:18:23.760]  So here's the latest news on McMaster.
[03:18:24.654 --> 03:18:28.237]  As of this is breaking news, nobody has this yet.
[03:18:28.237 --> 03:18:29.058]  Nobody knows this.
[03:18:29.058 --> 03:18:30.979]  This is an InfoWars exclusive.
[03:18:30.979 --> 03:18:33.582]  You're only going to get that information here with me.
[03:18:33.582 --> 03:18:40.588]  McMaster is bringing in two people who worked for, I kid you not, Ben Rhodes.
[03:18:40.588 --> 03:18:50.916]  McMaster is bringing in two holdovers from the Obama administration, two political appointees, two Ben Rhodes loyalists into the NSC.
[03:18:51.897 --> 03:18:52.558]  That's what H.R.
[03:18:52.558 --> 03:18:54.320]  McMaster is doing.
[03:18:54.320 --> 03:18:58.025]  And fortunately, you know, Sean Spicer loved it.
[03:18:58.025 --> 03:19:00.248]  Sean Spicer leaked to the media all the time.
[03:19:00.248 --> 03:19:01.709]  That's something that I had never...
[03:19:02.944 --> 03:19:10.770]  But I never made public before, because then, you know, he would try to blacklist me from coming to the White House press briefings and everything, so I had to be careful with Spicer.
[03:19:10.770 --> 03:19:13.011]  Thank God that he's out now.
[03:19:13.011 --> 03:19:24.199]  I can actually tell the truth about what an incompetent guy that was, and how he was sabotaging the administration, how he's leaking the media, how he and Reince Priebus were, they killed the war room idea.
[03:19:24.199 --> 03:19:27.521]  A lot of people didn't know this, but there was going to be a war room
[03:19:28.422 --> 03:19:34.183]  With actual heavy hitters getting content out, getting the media message out.
[03:19:34.183 --> 03:19:39.304]  Spicer, Renz, McMaster, a few other people within the comms team, they killed the war room.
[03:19:39.304 --> 03:19:41.525]  They said, oh, you're going to politicize the community.
[03:19:41.525 --> 03:19:42.985]  I kid you not.
[03:19:42.985 --> 03:19:43.605]  I kid you not.
[03:19:43.605 --> 03:19:44.726]  This is why they killed the war room.
[03:19:44.726 --> 03:19:51.267]  They go, you will be politicizing, you'll be politicizing the communications team.
[03:19:53.048 --> 03:19:56.312]  These are the incompetent or the saboteurs or the snakes.
[03:19:56.312 --> 03:19:58.435]  It doesn't even matter at this point.
[03:19:58.435 --> 03:20:07.628]  These are the kind of people Trump has to deal with where they're saying, well, we wouldn't want our communications department and the most beleaguered and attacked administration in U.S.
[03:20:07.628 --> 03:20:08.068]  history
[03:20:08.709 --> 03:20:10.510]  To actually have a message.
[03:20:10.510 --> 03:20:12.852]  To actually have a rapid response team.
[03:20:12.852 --> 03:20:15.114]  To actually focus on getting out content.
[03:20:15.114 --> 03:20:22.179]  That would be politicizing the communications department and we should never put... Who are these people and how did they get in?
[03:20:22.179 --> 03:20:26.582]  And that guy Michael Short who just got fired and then he goes, why quit?
[03:20:27.262 --> 03:20:28.964]  So actually another funny story too there.
[03:20:28.964 --> 03:20:33.788]  It's Mooch leaked out that he was going to fire Short as a karma.
[03:20:33.788 --> 03:20:35.209]  It was like karmic retribution.
[03:20:35.209 --> 03:20:37.291]  So Short had been leaking.
[03:20:37.291 --> 03:20:40.854]  So Mooch leaked out that he was going to fire Short.
[03:20:40.854 --> 03:20:44.197]  So then Short found out that he was going to be fired when he opened up Politico.
[03:20:44.197 --> 03:20:47.579]  When people were texting him the article that he was going to get fired.
[03:20:48.300 --> 03:20:57.867]  It's the same way that Trump fired, this gangster, you know, the way Trump fired Comey was Comey was giving a talk at the FBI and it flashes on Fox News.
[03:20:57.867 --> 03:20:59.448]  This is how you have to deal with these people.
[03:20:59.448 --> 03:21:04.032]  You're dealing with criminals like James Comey and the communications department.
[03:21:04.032 --> 03:21:07.834]  They're going to treat these people the way you treat people like that.
[03:21:07.834 --> 03:21:09.095]  You just end it.
[03:21:09.095 --> 03:21:10.877]  One day they show up and the key doesn't work.
[03:21:11.883 --> 03:21:17.548]  One day they show up to work and they get a Google alert for their name and they see Politico is reporting that they're going to be fired.
[03:21:17.548 --> 03:21:19.150]  That's what you have to do with all these people.
[03:21:19.150 --> 03:21:21.532]  We've got to get Rince Priebus out of there.
[03:21:21.532 --> 03:21:24.615]  We definitely... It's a good start though.
[03:21:24.615 --> 03:21:26.016]  So Mooch knows what he's doing.
[03:21:26.016 --> 03:21:30.300]  He knows that McMaster is leaking and hiring leakers.
[03:21:30.300 --> 03:21:34.024]  And we know that Lindsey Graham is anti-Trump.
[03:21:34.024 --> 03:21:37.347]  And Virginia Oboni, which is exclusive again for me,
[03:21:38.464 --> 03:21:40.365]  Another leaker that we identified.
[03:21:40.365 --> 03:21:41.786]  So we're getting him.
[03:21:41.786 --> 03:21:43.046]  There's big progress.
[03:21:43.046 --> 03:21:48.369]  And that is why when they said Scaramucci was going to be head of comms, I was through the roof.
[03:21:48.369 --> 03:21:49.589]  I was so hyped.
[03:21:49.589 --> 03:21:51.350]  And then a lot of people, how could you like him?
[03:21:51.350 --> 03:21:52.011]  You know, he's rich.
[03:21:52.850 --> 03:21:55.391]  I'm like, what is wrong with people?
[03:21:55.391 --> 03:21:57.511]  Are they brainwashed zombies?
[03:21:57.511 --> 03:21:59.992]  Nobody hates rich people.
[03:21:59.992 --> 03:22:02.073]  They hate thieves like Hillary Clinton.
[03:22:02.073 --> 03:22:06.634]  Hillary Clinton didn't get rich by providing entrepreneurial value to the world.
[03:22:06.634 --> 03:22:11.056]  Bill Clinton didn't become rich by providing entrepreneurial value to the world.
[03:22:11.056 --> 03:22:15.917]  Barack Obama is not becoming rich by giving value to the world.
[03:22:15.917 --> 03:22:17.498]  These are not intellectuals.
[03:22:17.498 --> 03:22:19.198]  They aren't job creators.
[03:22:19.198 --> 03:22:20.779]  What they do is they use
[03:22:21.769 --> 03:22:26.633]  Their influence and their positions and their power for corruption.
[03:22:26.633 --> 03:22:28.395]  That is what they do.
[03:22:28.395 --> 03:22:35.301]  So we have no problem with people actually make like if Goldman Sachs hadn't ripped people off in the stock market crash, I'd have no problem with Goldman Sachs.
[03:22:35.301 --> 03:22:38.664]  But as we know, they stole from the American public.
[03:22:38.664 --> 03:22:45.610]  They looted, they looted the public and they just short a lot of lives and they'd better hope the stock market stays up because it isn't going to.
[03:22:46.511 --> 03:22:47.756]  Be good for them.
[03:22:47.756 --> 03:22:51.390]  If they crash the market again or they're too reckless again, it'll be bad.
[03:22:51.390 --> 03:22:52.273]  So we have great.
[03:22:53.476 --> 03:22:56.559]  Great, great developments with Scaramucci.
[03:22:56.559 --> 03:23:02.944]  Finally, we have somebody in the White House who knows how to get a message out.
[03:23:02.944 --> 03:23:07.027]  Now, Scaramucci too, the media loves him because he knows how to handle the media.
[03:23:07.027 --> 03:23:11.531]  So, Scaramucci is a rare guy that can play both games, right?
[03:23:11.531 --> 03:23:13.813]  So, I'm really good at one game.
[03:23:13.813 --> 03:23:18.397]  I'm really good at the social media game, direct to consumers, direct to readers, direct to viewers.
[03:23:18.397 --> 03:23:18.937]  So, right now,
[03:23:19.935 --> 03:23:23.896]  Of course, I'm live on the Real Alex Jones Show, which is amazing.
[03:23:23.896 --> 03:23:25.456]  They're running YouTube Live.
[03:23:25.456 --> 03:23:26.977]  They're running Periscope.
[03:23:26.977 --> 03:23:29.537]  They're on Radio Terrestrial Radio all over the world.
[03:23:29.537 --> 03:23:32.698]  I'm right now on Facebook Live with one phone.
[03:23:32.698 --> 03:23:35.779]  My Periscope is live on another iPad.
[03:23:35.779 --> 03:23:38.500]  I need to get another camera set up so I can do YouTube Live.
[03:23:38.500 --> 03:23:39.960]  So I'm really good at reaching
[03:23:41.286 --> 03:23:45.609]  Massive amounts of people directly bypassing the media.
[03:23:45.609 --> 03:23:49.091]  But I'm not good at playing the traditional media game.
[03:23:49.091 --> 03:23:50.431]  And I'm getting better at it.
[03:23:50.431 --> 03:23:51.752]  Mooch is good at both.
[03:23:51.752 --> 03:23:58.096]  He knows how to reach the people and he knows how to work with the traditional media people.
[03:23:58.096 --> 03:23:59.216]  He's a rare talent.
[03:23:59.216 --> 03:24:02.138]  A once-in-a-generation media talent.
[03:24:02.138 --> 03:24:05.320]  So Mooch, he's in there.
[03:24:05.320 --> 03:24:06.721]  And now there's finally Periscope.
[03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:08.360]  Right?
[03:24:08.360 --> 03:24:09.841]  That was a historic moment.
[03:24:09.841 --> 03:24:13.222]  They periscoped President Trump in Air Force One.
[03:24:13.222 --> 03:24:13.902]  We need more of that.
[03:24:13.902 --> 03:24:15.043]  We need fireside chats.
[03:24:15.043 --> 03:24:22.305]  We need the multiple, you know, computers, phones, webcams, whatever you want to call it, streaming live.
[03:24:22.305 --> 03:24:23.425]  They're getting there.
[03:24:23.425 --> 03:24:24.706]  And they're trying.
[03:24:24.706 --> 03:24:26.927]  We have incredible momentum right now.
[03:24:26.927 --> 03:24:28.727]  Scaramucci even said that.
[03:24:28.727 --> 03:24:30.048]  Momentum.
[03:24:30.048 --> 03:24:33.249]  Trump referenced momentum.
[03:24:33.249 --> 03:24:36.230]  How many people understand this and can connect these dots the way I can?
[03:24:37.671 --> 03:24:38.732]  They don't read books.
[03:24:38.732 --> 03:24:40.352]  They've never read The Art of the Deal.
[03:24:40.352 --> 03:24:43.354]  They've never read Trump's book Think Big and Kick.
[03:24:43.354 --> 03:24:45.115]  We'll call it Butt because I think we're on the radio.
[03:24:45.115 --> 03:24:46.596]  We'll keep it family-friendly.
[03:24:46.596 --> 03:24:47.756]  They don't know anything.
[03:24:47.756 --> 03:24:49.837]  They don't actually study his work.
[03:24:49.837 --> 03:24:55.040]  And there's incredible momentum right now, and both Trump and Scaramucci are momentum players.
[03:24:55.040 --> 03:24:57.501]  I actually got a message from the highest levels today.
[03:24:57.501 --> 03:25:00.563]  I can't say from who, obviously, but the highest level said,
[03:25:01.363 --> 03:25:02.704]  Let your people know today.
[03:25:02.704 --> 03:25:04.846]  Because they knew I was going on Alex Jones.
[03:25:04.846 --> 03:25:05.367]  They saw that.
[03:25:05.367 --> 03:25:07.228]  They monitor my Twitter religiously.
[03:25:07.228 --> 03:25:08.209]  McMaster does too.
[03:25:08.209 --> 03:25:10.071]  He reads it personally.
[03:25:10.071 --> 03:25:11.412]  And he doesn't like it.
[03:25:11.412 --> 03:25:14.755]  People overheard him screaming today about Cernovich's tweets.
[03:25:14.755 --> 03:25:16.216]  They literally... You could...
[03:25:17.346 --> 03:25:24.891]  I mean, if the media really told the truth, they don't tell the truth about Mike Cernovich, though, because they don't want me to look more influential as I actually am.
[03:25:24.891 --> 03:25:31.755]  They don't want to tell the truth about how much impact that we're having because they're trying to get me banned and everything, rather than do hit jobs.
[03:25:31.755 --> 03:25:36.738]  McMaster was heard screaming at the West Wing about Cernovich's tweets.
[03:25:36.738 --> 03:25:38.519]  Effin' tweets screaming!
[03:25:38.519 --> 03:25:40.000]  So McMaster is mad because
[03:25:41.098 --> 03:25:45.401]  I revealed that Mooch directly contradicted him.
[03:25:45.401 --> 03:25:51.846]  So Mooch went on Fox News today and said Obama holdovers are the leakers.
[03:25:51.846 --> 03:25:56.670]  But McMaster had said a week or two ago, there's no such thing as an Obama holdover.
[03:25:56.670 --> 03:26:03.055]  Now the fake news media, because they're not intelligent people, and they don't actually, they have goldfish memories, right?
[03:26:03.055 --> 03:26:07.258]  All they care, oh well Trump tweeted something today, let's forget everything happened.
[03:26:07.258 --> 03:26:09.040]  But I'm always a strategic player.
[03:26:10.191 --> 03:26:16.492]  And as a strategic player, I'm always thinking, well, what happened today and how does this move work with the other pieces on the board?
[03:26:16.492 --> 03:26:18.813]  So what Mooch did today was significant.
[03:26:18.813 --> 03:26:23.414]  What Mooch did was said, look, we know McMaster is the bad guy.
[03:26:23.414 --> 03:26:26.595]  We know he wants to bring in people who work for Ben Rhodes.
[03:26:26.595 --> 03:26:29.295]  We know who the leakers are in HR.
[03:26:29.295 --> 03:26:31.236]  He better get his act together or he'll be out.
[03:26:32.395 --> 03:26:35.516]  And we're on his tail.
[03:26:35.516 --> 03:26:36.677]  So he's triggered.
[03:26:36.677 --> 03:26:46.801]  I've heard multiple, you know, 10, 15, 20 people have told me that McMaster actually has a personal vendetta against me because I'm cyberbullied.
[03:26:46.801 --> 03:26:49.042]  He said I'm a bully.
[03:26:49.042 --> 03:26:50.162]  And you know who I'm bullying?
[03:26:50.162 --> 03:26:52.763]  You can't make this up.
[03:26:52.763 --> 03:26:53.563]  You can't make it up.
[03:26:53.563 --> 03:26:58.265]  I gotta just pause and take a deep breath because it sounds so absurd, and yet it is not.
[03:26:58.265 --> 03:26:59.285]  It is true.
[03:26:59.285 --> 03:27:00.106]  So you know who I'm bullying?
[03:27:01.249 --> 03:27:03.035]  I'm bullying Deep State.
[03:27:03.035 --> 03:27:04.219]  I kid you not.
[03:27:04.219 --> 03:27:07.731]  They said that it is unfair for me to target
[03:27:08.649 --> 03:27:10.430]  People in the CIA.
[03:27:10.430 --> 03:27:13.931]  People who are at the highest levels of government.
[03:27:13.931 --> 03:27:16.412]  People who are at the highest levels of intelligence.
[03:27:16.412 --> 03:27:20.274]  They said it's unfair for me to target them.
[03:27:20.274 --> 03:27:22.215]  They've been spying on us.
[03:27:22.215 --> 03:27:24.916]  They've been spying on us for decades.
[03:27:24.916 --> 03:27:31.398]  But when I publicly talk about what they're doing and how they're leaking and everything, then I'm just a big bully.
[03:27:31.398 --> 03:27:33.279]  And the media goes along with it.
[03:27:33.279 --> 03:27:37.301]  They're going, in foreign policy, oh yeah, Cernovich is being mean to these people.
[03:27:38.305 --> 03:27:42.951]  I mean it really... How do you bully a three-star general?
[03:27:42.951 --> 03:27:44.553]  That's what I would like to know.
[03:27:44.553 --> 03:27:51.922]  How do you bully a three-star general, a veteran of multiple... If McMaster isn't strong enough for me, if he's shook...
[03:27:52.802 --> 03:28:01.948]  Maybe he should read Gorilla Mindset or go to one of my seminars and learn how to check into the present moment and learn how to not be rattled and shook up all the time.
[03:28:01.948 --> 03:28:03.169]  Maybe he needs some mindset stuff.
[03:28:03.169 --> 03:28:09.873]  Maybe I should do a Gorilla Mindset training seminar at the... I actually should, now that I think about it.
[03:28:09.873 --> 03:28:12.055]  McMaster, I know you're watching, buddy.
[03:28:12.055 --> 03:28:14.096]  I know you watch everything we do.
[03:28:14.096 --> 03:28:14.796]  I know what you're doing.
[03:28:14.796 --> 03:28:16.157]  You think you spy on me?
[03:28:16.157 --> 03:28:16.818]  That's what you think.
[03:28:18.396 --> 03:28:21.103]  I'll come in and give you a guerrilla mindset seminar.
[03:28:21.103 --> 03:28:22.326]  And I'll give...
[03:28:23.494 --> 03:28:24.815]  All the secrets.
[03:28:24.815 --> 03:28:28.258]  And then what'll happen is you'll no longer be a puppet for the globalists.
[03:28:28.258 --> 03:28:31.420]  You'll no longer be a puppet for the warmongers.
[03:28:31.420 --> 03:28:38.566]  You'll actually want to make the world a better place because you'll believe in yourself and you'll find inner peace and happiness and love and joy in your own heart.
[03:28:38.566 --> 03:28:47.552]  And then you're going to want to spread that into the world instead of trying to spread more chaos and destruction and murder to the world.
[03:28:47.552 --> 03:28:49.093]  McMaster also, too.
[03:28:49.093 --> 03:28:50.394]  Nobody else had this before me.
[03:28:51.255 --> 03:28:56.776]  presented his plan for the Afghan troop surge.
[03:28:56.776 --> 03:29:00.277]  So that was there was a principal's meeting today or was scheduled for today.
[03:29:00.277 --> 03:29:01.938]  These things get moved often.
[03:29:01.938 --> 03:29:07.799]  McMaster is still trying to get his troop surge going on.
[03:29:07.799 --> 03:29:09.640]  He really wants more troops in Afghanistan.
[03:29:09.640 --> 03:29:11.200]  He won't let it drop.
[03:29:11.200 --> 03:29:14.321]  Trump is very frustrated with him.
[03:29:15.475 --> 03:29:17.377]  So we gotta keep the heat on McMaster.
[03:29:17.377 --> 03:29:19.158]  We gotta keep the heat on.
[03:29:19.158 --> 03:29:20.820]  Share the links about McMaster.
[03:29:20.820 --> 03:29:23.662]  Get the message out about McMaster.
[03:29:23.662 --> 03:29:27.165]  Ben Rhodes should not be in the NSC.
[03:29:27.165 --> 03:29:31.529]  Ben Rhodes... Actually, let's talk about Ben Rhodes in this next segment.
[03:29:32.734 --> 03:29:36.738]  He testified before the Senate and that never got leaked.
[03:29:36.738 --> 03:29:38.299]  So we're going to go on break right now.
[03:29:38.299 --> 03:29:44.965]  The next segment we're going to talk about Ben Rhodes, McMaster, and how Soros is controlling McMaster and is owning McMaster.
[03:29:44.965 --> 03:29:47.007]  We'll be back the next segment.
[03:29:56.616 --> 03:30:00.539]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:00.539 --> 03:30:03.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:08.536 --> 03:30:17.423]  After speaking with his military staff, President Trump has banned transgenders from the military, citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons.
[03:30:17.423 --> 03:30:23.608]  His decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another.
[03:30:23.608 --> 03:30:28.031]  In other news, President Trump also publicly blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not replacing
[03:30:28.211 --> 03:30:28.871]  I don't know.
[03:30:50.558 --> 03:30:51.078]  We're good to go.
[03:31:08.706 --> 03:31:10.607]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:10.607 --> 03:31:12.628]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:12.628 --> 03:31:15.550]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:15.550 --> 03:31:21.593]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:21.593 --> 03:31:30.798]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:31:30.798 --> 03:31:33.139]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your
[03:31:33.319 --> 03:31:38.324]  Your co-workers, your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:38.324 --> 03:31:46.352]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:46.352 --> 03:31:47.313]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:48.528 --> 03:31:52.452]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:52.452 --> 03:31:56.035]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:56.035 --> 03:32:02.741]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:32:02.741 --> 03:32:06.865]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[03:32:08.815 --> 03:32:14.217]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:32:14.217 --> 03:32:17.079]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:32:17.079 --> 03:32:19.060]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:32:19.060 --> 03:32:24.082]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:32:24.082 --> 03:32:26.163]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:32:26.163 --> 03:32:27.443]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:32:27.443 --> 03:32:32.585]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:32.585 --> 03:32:35.927]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[03:32:36.087 --> 03:32:39.449]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:39.449 --> 03:32:42.430]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:42.430 --> 03:32:46.132]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:46.132 --> 03:32:53.035]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:53.035 --> 03:33:00.559]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[03:33:03.740 --> 03:33:04.540]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:33:04.540 --> 03:33:06.741]  It's the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:33:24.983 --> 03:33:26.684]  Thanks for joining me back, everybody.

[03:33:35.992 --> 03:33:36.932]  Let's get this trending.
[03:33:36.932 --> 03:33:40.075]  So let's talk about Ben Rhodes for a minute.
[03:33:40.075 --> 03:33:42.016]  And I sent a couple links to the production team.
[03:33:42.016 --> 03:33:42.757]  So they're so great.
[03:33:42.757 --> 03:33:44.678]  They'll pull that up.
[03:33:44.678 --> 03:33:46.520]  Ben Rhodes, he worked for Obama.
[03:33:48.463 --> 03:33:49.544]  Lied to reporters.
[03:33:49.544 --> 03:33:57.350]  He actually was quoted on the record as saying that I can convince a 26 year old at the Washington Post of anything.
[03:33:57.350 --> 03:33:59.531]  So he's an admitted liar.
[03:33:59.531 --> 03:34:01.573]  And he admitted that he conned them.
[03:34:01.573 --> 03:34:06.016]  But if you work at the Washington Post, you don't actually care if they lie to you.
[03:34:06.016 --> 03:34:11.780]  All you care about is harming freedom and harming liberty and harming the people who want to help.
[03:34:11.780 --> 03:34:16.304]  So for eight years, Obama and Ben Rhodes said they had secret talks with Iran.
[03:34:17.799 --> 03:34:19.500]  We never heard about it.
[03:34:19.500 --> 03:34:23.742]  How is it that they were able to keep the Iran deal secret?
[03:34:23.742 --> 03:34:29.444]  Think about, again, let's connect some dots and let's talk about McMaster and why McMaster is right now.
[03:34:29.444 --> 03:34:32.325]  The number one greatest threat to national security in America is H.R.
[03:34:32.325 --> 03:34:33.306]  McMaster.
[03:34:33.306 --> 03:34:38.028]  You can quote that, you can tweet it out, you can clip that, the video footage.
[03:34:38.028 --> 03:34:43.250]  The number one threat to national security in the United States of America is H.R.
[03:34:43.250 --> 03:34:44.351]  McMaster.
[03:34:44.351 --> 03:34:45.671]  Quote me on that.
[03:34:45.671 --> 03:34:46.532]  So McMaster
[03:34:47.694 --> 03:34:52.097]  Has leaks every day coming out from Ben Rhodes' people.
[03:34:52.097 --> 03:34:56.981]  But there were no leaks about the Iran deal during the Obama administration.
[03:34:56.981 --> 03:34:59.543]  Ben Rhodes wasn't leaking anything.
[03:34:59.543 --> 03:35:00.804]  So what does that tell you?
[03:35:00.804 --> 03:35:07.008]  Well, Ben Rhodes testified before the Senate committee either yesterday or the day before that.
[03:35:07.008 --> 03:35:09.931]  Isn't that amazing that was never leaked?
[03:35:09.931 --> 03:35:12.973]  Isn't it amazing that nobody had advanced knowledge?
[03:35:12.973 --> 03:35:15.795]  The House Intelligence Committee met with Ben Rhodes.
[03:35:15.795 --> 03:35:16.916]  Nobody had that story!
[03:35:18.100 --> 03:35:19.421]  You know why?
[03:35:19.421 --> 03:35:20.762]  Favor trading.
[03:35:20.762 --> 03:35:28.128]  What they do is, if you get a leak from Ben Rhodes or Ben Rhodes' people, it's like a code of silence.
[03:35:28.128 --> 03:35:40.297]  And that really goes to show you how corrupt the fake news media is, that there's this major code of silence, that they're going to protect Rhodes at all costs.
[03:35:40.297 --> 03:35:42.078]  So then the question would be, why does H.R.
[03:35:42.078 --> 03:35:42.779]  McMaster
[03:35:43.860 --> 03:35:50.408]  Want to bring in two political appointees from the Obama administration who've worked for Ben Rhodes.
[03:35:50.408 --> 03:35:53.012]  Because McMaster wants information leaked.
[03:35:53.012 --> 03:35:55.495]  He wants their national security secrets leaked.
[03:35:55.495 --> 03:35:58.319]  He wants to do anything he can to harm Trump.
[03:35:58.319 --> 03:36:01.423]  Because... Who owns McMaster?
[03:36:02.918 --> 03:36:04.098]  Soros.
[03:36:04.098 --> 03:36:09.620]  George Soros, McMaster, Petraeus had a secret meeting at Bilderberg.
[03:36:09.620 --> 03:36:12.061]  I bet you nobody has that story yet.
[03:36:12.061 --> 03:36:17.402]  See, I have so many scoops out there that I just release them on air all the time.
[03:36:17.402 --> 03:36:20.263]  I don't even have time to write them all up.
[03:36:20.263 --> 03:36:26.505]  If I wrote up everything I knew, I wouldn't have any fingers left because I would be typing all day and my hands would quit working.
[03:36:27.245 --> 03:36:29.026]  There's so much.
[03:36:29.026 --> 03:36:31.867]  There's so much to talk about all the time.
[03:36:31.867 --> 03:36:35.568]  That's how bad McMaster is and why we really have to get McMaster.
[03:36:35.568 --> 03:36:37.068]  We have to fire him.
[03:36:37.068 --> 03:36:38.709]  But we're going to take some calls.
[03:36:38.709 --> 03:36:41.690]  Carlos has been on the line for two hours.
[03:36:41.690 --> 03:36:42.830]  I know Alex.
[03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:44.391]  I'll hold him to this.
[03:36:44.391 --> 03:36:47.812]  Alex says if you're on hold for longer than an hour, you get a free T-shirt.
[03:36:47.812 --> 03:36:52.554]  So Carlos, even though I'm not the boss, even though I'm not the boss, that's the truth.
[03:36:56.923 --> 03:36:58.705]  Oh, sorry, Carlos.
[03:36:58.705 --> 03:37:00.246]  That's a bummer.
[03:37:00.246 --> 03:37:02.788]  We'll take the next caller here.
[03:37:02.788 --> 03:37:07.232]  I don't have the screen right up right now, so we'll take Sean.
[03:37:07.232 --> 03:37:09.834]  How you doing, Sean?
[03:37:09.834 --> 03:37:10.254]  I'm great.
[03:37:10.254 --> 03:37:11.415]  How are you?
[03:37:11.415 --> 03:37:14.498]  Doing well.
[03:37:14.498 --> 03:37:19.502]  I was wanting to talk about the implementation of COG.
[03:37:19.502 --> 03:37:23.705]  I believe that that plan is still moving forward.
[03:37:23.705 --> 03:37:25.126]  I don't think they ever dropped it.
[03:37:26.297 --> 03:37:29.140]  What plan?
[03:37:29.140 --> 03:37:33.043]  The plan to implement COG.
[03:37:33.043 --> 03:37:36.006]  Is that an acronym?
[03:37:36.006 --> 03:37:39.810]  I'm not really sure what that acronym is.
[03:37:39.810 --> 03:37:41.071]  To bring the deep state in.
[03:37:41.071 --> 03:37:43.673]  In a state of emergency.
[03:37:43.673 --> 03:37:46.576]  Got you, bring in the deep state.
[03:37:46.576 --> 03:37:50.420]  I believe that Hillary was a Patsy candidate.
[03:37:51.304 --> 03:38:01.889]  Because if you notice about Hillary's health right now, you know, she's always on the verge of grim death, but she's not always... She's not fumbling around dying every two seconds.
[03:38:01.889 --> 03:38:16.657]  And so I believe that, um, they were possibly poisoning her, using her for a pap sheet, a pap sheet to win the presidency, get in there, open the borders, use some executive orders, take the guns, and then they were gonna kill her.
[03:38:16.657 --> 03:38:17.057]  And then...
[03:38:18.396 --> 03:38:18.596]  Okay.
[03:38:48.797 --> 03:38:54.720]  Everyone, even like Jeff Sessions, who's been just totally weak on everything except for TPP.
[03:38:54.720 --> 03:39:01.604]  He's been, if you take away TPP, he looks like a Democrat.
[03:39:01.604 --> 03:39:16.093]  And I think that right now everyone should be really worried because even these people that Trump puts in, they're still getting pulled over to the other side.
[03:39:16.093 --> 03:39:17.494]  I think that Pence, I mean...
[03:39:19.032 --> 03:39:19.993]  Where has he been?
[03:39:19.993 --> 03:39:27.278]  No one's heard anything about Pence pretty much since they won the presidency.
[03:39:27.278 --> 03:39:32.321]  And so I kind of believe that he's just kind of hiding in the background to see what's going to happen.
[03:39:32.321 --> 03:39:46.810]  I really believe now that their plan is to try to assassinate Trump and carry out some form of false flag here on the states and then implement martial law, which will open the door to bring in Deep State.
[03:39:46.810 --> 03:39:47.991]  And once that happens,
[03:39:48.897 --> 03:39:51.939]  Uh, we're not going to get out from underneath of it.
[03:39:51.939 --> 03:39:54.101]  And then all hell's going to break loose.
[03:39:54.101 --> 03:39:59.785]  And the only way we're going to get out of it is not going to be pretty.
[03:39:59.785 --> 03:40:03.387]  Um... Okay, well thank you.
[03:40:03.387 --> 03:40:12.214]  Thanks for your call, sir.
[03:40:12.214 --> 03:40:12.754]  Okay, okay.
[03:40:12.754 --> 03:40:13.815]  We have another caller.
[03:40:13.815 --> 03:40:17.137]  Carol, it looks like.
[03:40:17.137 --> 03:40:18.278]  Carol?
[03:40:18.278 --> 03:40:18.518]  Carol.
[03:40:19.451 --> 03:40:20.311]  Hi.
[03:40:20.311 --> 03:40:23.672]  Hey, how are you?
[03:40:23.672 --> 03:40:24.212]  Amazed.
[03:40:24.212 --> 03:40:24.832]  I'm online.
[03:40:24.832 --> 03:40:27.333]  Welcome.
[03:40:27.333 --> 03:40:29.473]  Thank you.
[03:40:29.473 --> 03:40:38.636]  I am not sure this is true, but from what little I've looked at it, it seems very important.
[03:40:38.636 --> 03:40:47.658]  The coup of President Trump may be taking action by legislation.
[03:40:47.658 --> 03:40:48.878]  They have passed
[03:40:50.333 --> 03:40:58.575]  In the Senate, apparently not in the Congress in the House yet, Senate Bill 722.
[03:40:58.575 --> 03:41:11.738]  And you know in bills that they can name them one thing and have a lot of information, but they can add other stuff.
[03:41:11.738 --> 03:41:17.960]  The title of Senate Bill 722 is Countering Iran's Destabilization Act.
[03:41:18.488 --> 03:41:22.770]  Activities Act of 2017.
[03:41:22.770 --> 03:41:41.019]  But in Title II portion of it, which is lots of words down, it has to do... it also apparently takes over control of sanctions of Russia and takes over control of what the President can do by legislation.
[03:41:43.738 --> 03:41:44.899]  I need help with that.
[03:41:44.899 --> 03:41:47.460]  I'm not saying it's true, absolutely.
[03:41:47.460 --> 03:42:04.787]  Just from what I've looked at, it looks very possible that while we're all excited about this other stuff, that the Congress may pass a bill that takes over a whole bunch of powers of President Trump by passing the bill.
[03:42:04.787 --> 03:42:11.749]  That's what like an eight-minute summary by Anonymous suggested, so I went and looked up the bill.
[03:42:13.960 --> 03:42:35.295]  I want, and I'm looking at the legal parts of the bill going, you know, lots of words and lots of legalese, so I'm not sure, but it's already passed the Senate, and Anonymous was saying that it passed like 98 to 2, and so the
[03:42:40.459 --> 03:42:46.603]  The House and the Senate may be taking things over by passing a law.
[03:42:46.603 --> 03:42:47.263]  Okay, gotcha.
[03:42:47.263 --> 03:42:49.404]  Yeah, we'll definitely look into it.
[03:42:49.404 --> 03:42:54.307]  Thank you again for your call.
[03:42:54.307 --> 03:42:55.108]  Always good to hear from you.
[03:42:55.108 --> 03:42:55.548]  Thanks, Carol.
[03:42:57.955 --> 03:42:59.898]  Okay, yeah, I appreciate the call.
[03:42:59.898 --> 03:43:02.501]  Yeah, we'll take the next call or we'll take a few more.
[03:43:02.501 --> 03:43:05.284]  Yeah, that one, it's just a sanctions bill, so I don't know.
[03:43:05.284 --> 03:43:09.109]  I mean, a lot of things get spun way out of proportion.
[03:43:09.109 --> 03:43:12.213]  A sanctions bill was passed, it was bipartisan.
[03:43:12.213 --> 03:43:13.335]  I don't think it's a good idea.
[03:43:13.335 --> 03:43:14.636]  These sanctions never really work.
[03:43:15.458 --> 03:43:19.161]  But a lot of times people read way more into that stuff than it really is.
[03:43:19.161 --> 03:43:23.085]  It isn't stripping Trump of any of his presidency.
[03:43:23.085 --> 03:43:26.848]  I guess in theory, you're taking away some of his executive powers.
[03:43:26.848 --> 03:43:28.169]  It's a separation of powers issue.
[03:43:28.169 --> 03:43:36.677]  But there's a lot of hysteria and unless I have a lot of evidence supporting it, I definitely, I don't like to feed into that.
[03:43:36.677 --> 03:43:37.838]  Greg from Montana, how you doing?
[03:43:41.013 --> 03:43:42.894]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[03:43:42.894 --> 03:44:06.161]  I was prompted to call by the pastor who was on with Alex, and he was talking a lot about prayer and the need for prayer, and one of the things that I would like to throw out there for everyone who might be open to this is the idea of many, many people in all parts of the country and maybe other parts of the world getting together to do the Psalms.
[03:44:06.161 --> 03:44:10.582]  This was done in early colonial times by the pilgrims, the Puritans,
[03:44:11.132 --> 03:44:18.018]  And up until revolutionary times, people would get together in churches and recite the Psalms.
[03:44:18.018 --> 03:44:25.484]  I think probably the King James Version would be the best for people to use because it's most widely accepted.
[03:44:25.484 --> 03:44:32.330]  Catholics could accept it, even perhaps many of the spiritually-minded Jews.
[03:44:32.330 --> 03:44:37.374]  And people could come together in small groups, in churches, even in stadiums.
[03:44:37.865 --> 03:44:40.686]  And over the internet and do this.
[03:44:40.686 --> 03:44:47.647]  The pastor was talking about his 24-hour prayer services for the president and the country.
[03:44:47.647 --> 03:44:54.189]  And this is one way where people could come together and recite the Psalms aloud in unison.
[03:44:54.189 --> 03:45:04.272]  And when people do this, if you've ever experienced anything where you feel a lot of powerful spiritual energy, this does it.
[03:45:04.272 --> 03:45:04.912]  It's amazing.
[03:45:06.755 --> 03:45:12.362]  People need to try it, even coming together in small groups, just prayer groups.
[03:45:12.362 --> 03:45:15.886]  We're 99% in a spiritual war.
[03:45:15.886 --> 03:45:22.414]  There is an information war, but we're in a spiritual war, if that is the primary thing that we're dealing with.
[03:45:23.098 --> 03:45:29.021]  As the Bible says, you wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with powers and principalities.
[03:45:29.021 --> 03:45:32.683]  And that's what we're dealing with at the ultimate level.
[03:45:32.683 --> 03:45:36.945]  All of the people that we see are simply pawns for spiritual forces.
[03:45:36.945 --> 03:45:42.847]  And the way that this has been dealt with since time immemorial is with prayer and fasting.
[03:45:42.847 --> 03:45:50.091]  And one of the reasons for the Psalms is that they're the most widely accepted thing that is divinely inspired.
[03:45:50.091 --> 03:45:50.531]  And so,
[03:45:51.682 --> 03:46:10.648]  I just throw out the idea of Psalms over America, and people could, you know, take that along with it, but this is something that I think the pastor could be a great force for putting out there, is that people of all faiths could come together and give
[03:46:11.229 --> 03:46:19.292]  These Psalms, Protestants, Catholics, and even Jews, and we would have a united force for saving this nation.
[03:46:19.292 --> 03:46:23.574]  It has to be done first and foremost at a spiritual level.
[03:46:23.574 --> 03:46:25.895]  It's not going to be done just with information.
[03:46:25.895 --> 03:46:32.378]  Information is very important, but the spiritual component of this is primo.
[03:46:32.378 --> 03:46:34.359]  It's the number one thing we have to do.
[03:46:35.339 --> 03:46:37.722]  Gotcha, thank you so much for your call.
[03:46:37.722 --> 03:46:43.489]  The caller does raise an interesting point, which is that America is spiritually bankrupt.
[03:46:43.489 --> 03:46:49.697]  Whatever your religion is, most people in America have no philosophical mooring, no worldview.
[03:46:49.697 --> 03:46:53.782]  It's very much fake, hedonistic culture.
[03:46:54.503 --> 03:47:12.315]  And if you look at the Psalms and the Proverbs, I've told people, even if you have no religion, you should read something like the Proverbs, because that is wisdom, timeless wisdom, that talks about avoiding trouble, avoiding drama, avoiding the evil, avoiding the wicked.
[03:47:12.315 --> 03:47:17.119]  And there isn't any wisdom like that coming down these days.
[03:47:17.119 --> 03:47:20.021]  I mean, I always say, think about it like this.
[03:47:21.263 --> 03:47:25.486]  There used to be the concept, this archetype of the old wise man.
[03:47:25.486 --> 03:47:30.349]  How many old wise men are there out there?
[03:47:30.349 --> 03:47:30.949]  Right?
[03:47:30.949 --> 03:47:38.174]  How many people are there who are wise and you're going to turn to for advice, turn to for insight?
[03:47:38.174 --> 03:47:42.597]  It's very rare these days because everybody wants to live this culture of eternal youth.
[03:47:43.717 --> 03:47:45.539]  And eternal partying and eternal hedonism.
[03:47:45.539 --> 03:47:46.559]  It's a very sad thing.
[03:47:46.559 --> 03:47:48.140]  So the caller is right.
[03:47:48.140 --> 03:47:59.949]  Whatever your religion is, even if you're not religious, you can engage in secular practices like just being mindful, being present, mindset training, meditation, a lot of things.
[03:47:59.949 --> 03:48:01.810]  I totally agree with that caller.
[03:48:01.810 --> 03:48:03.011]  There needs to be something.
[03:48:03.011 --> 03:48:05.813]  And if you are Christians of the Psalms across America,
[03:48:06.593 --> 03:48:08.533]  Sounds like a great idea to me.
[03:48:08.533 --> 03:48:11.634]  You should definitely be meeting in prayer groups and meeting in larger events.
[03:48:11.634 --> 03:48:14.975]  So the caller said it was called Psalms Across America.
[03:48:14.975 --> 03:48:16.655]  This is an interesting concept.
[03:48:16.655 --> 03:48:18.716]  Somebody should run with that.
[03:48:18.716 --> 03:48:19.256]  That's the thing.
[03:48:19.256 --> 03:48:23.477]  A lot of people come up with ideas, but then they don't want to take ownership and responsibility.
[03:48:23.477 --> 03:48:27.958]  And that relates to the spiritual bankruptcy in America, the lack of leadership.
[03:48:27.958 --> 03:48:30.238]  People go, Mike, do this, do that, do this, do that, do that.
[03:48:30.238 --> 03:48:31.499]  And they'll give me like 15 different.
[03:48:31.499 --> 03:48:32.359]  I'm like, what are you doing?
[03:48:33.365 --> 03:48:34.085]  Right?
[03:48:34.085 --> 03:48:37.866]  And I'm not putting that collar on blast because I'm not singling him out.
[03:48:37.866 --> 03:48:43.347]  I'm just saying that there is a mindset to just say, well, somebody needs to do this.
[03:48:43.347 --> 03:48:46.327]  Well, if not you, then who?
[03:48:46.327 --> 03:48:47.308]  There is no somebody.
[03:48:47.308 --> 03:48:48.108]  There's you.
[03:48:48.108 --> 03:48:48.928]  Everybody listening.
[03:48:48.928 --> 03:48:50.668]  It's up to you to take action.
[03:48:50.668 --> 03:48:52.789]  It's up to you to implement these ideas.
[03:48:52.789 --> 03:48:55.609]  Sharing ideas is good, but somebody has to do it.
[03:48:55.609 --> 03:48:57.210]  It should be you.
[03:48:57.210 --> 03:48:59.070]  Dr. Kelly from California.
[03:48:59.070 --> 03:48:59.530]  How you doing?
[03:49:05.643 --> 03:49:13.905]  With your permission, and I have the toll-free capital switchboard telephone number for Congress and the Senators.
[03:49:13.905 --> 03:49:15.725]  Can I give that out?
[03:49:15.725 --> 03:49:20.946]  Yeah, I don't, unless there's some kind of rule against it, I don't see why you can't.
[03:49:20.946 --> 03:49:21.486]  Okay.
[03:49:21.486 --> 03:49:22.626]  Is there a reason?
[03:49:22.626 --> 03:49:24.907]  Do you want people to call about something specific, or what?
[03:49:24.907 --> 03:49:25.767]  Yes.
[03:49:25.767 --> 03:49:30.268]  Call your Senators, call your Congressmen, women, and children.
[03:49:30.268 --> 03:49:34.389]  I'd like people to visit WifiFacts.com.
[03:49:35.916 --> 03:49:44.840]  Antennasearch.com, and the toll-free capital switchboard is 877-762-8762.
[03:49:44.840 --> 03:50:02.789]  They're there for you 24 hours a day, so that when you're frustrated, you can't sleep because of all the radiobiological weapons or the Prozac in the water, you call them, and you speak to your congressmen, women, and children, and your senators.
[03:50:04.275 --> 03:50:06.556]  Okay, well thank you so much for your call.
[03:50:06.556 --> 03:50:12.118]  I definitely agree that politicians, they do want to stay in power, so the best thing you can do is
[03:50:27.008 --> 03:50:27.928]  Call them up.
[03:50:27.928 --> 03:50:29.249]  Let your voice... I mean, that's what I do.
[03:50:29.249 --> 03:50:35.271]  I mean, that's the power of Twitter and other social media, is that they can monitor what we do in real time.
[03:50:35.271 --> 03:50:37.132]  There's pros and cons.
[03:50:37.132 --> 03:50:43.735]  The Deep State monitors us in real time for nefarious purposes, but there are... I've been told.
[03:50:43.735 --> 03:50:45.155]  I know this for a fact.
[03:50:45.155 --> 03:50:52.298]  The White House does monitor my Twitter feed, and they do monitor what all of you say when you, you know, comment and everything else.
[03:50:52.298 --> 03:50:53.699]  So it's very, very important.
[03:50:53.699 --> 03:50:54.979]  So that was it for the call.
[03:50:54.979 --> 03:50:56.340]  Let's thank everybody for their calls.
[03:50:57.847 --> 03:50:59.148]  There's a lot to talk about today.
[03:50:59.148 --> 03:51:02.232]  You know, there's always so much going on.
[03:51:02.232 --> 03:51:07.637]  But what I really want to talk about is the transgender ban in the military.
[03:51:07.637 --> 03:51:10.100]  But mainly because I want to know what is really going on.
[03:51:10.100 --> 03:51:11.722]  And I'm working on this story.
[03:51:11.722 --> 03:51:13.203]  This was always going to happen.
[03:51:13.203 --> 03:51:16.146]  I knew about this story, but I was told to embargo it.
[03:51:16.146 --> 03:51:17.448]  So it was always going to happen.
[03:51:19.847 --> 03:51:21.348]  Why today?
[03:51:21.348 --> 03:51:24.249]  This wasn't supposed to be released until September.
[03:51:24.249 --> 03:51:26.790]  This was not an urgent matter.
[03:51:26.790 --> 03:51:29.851]  It wasn't something that needed to be done today.
[03:51:29.851 --> 03:51:31.912]  So, what's really going on?
[03:51:31.912 --> 03:51:32.992]  I don't know.
[03:51:32.992 --> 03:51:37.354]  I'm starting to think it is maybe related to the Ewan Brothers.
[03:51:37.354 --> 03:51:47.097]  There has been massive action on the Ewan Brothers, and in fact, the attorney for one of the brothers issued a statement which I posted to my Twitter.
[03:51:47.097 --> 03:51:48.798]  And, for those of you who don't know,
[03:51:50.188 --> 03:51:54.371]  Debbie Wasserman Schiltz hired a Pakistani IT firm.
[03:51:54.371 --> 03:51:56.733]  And by the way, this isn't about Pakistanis.
[03:51:56.733 --> 03:51:59.515]  I don't think Pakistanis are bad people or anything like that.
[03:51:59.515 --> 03:52:05.820]  But the issue is that imagine Trump hired a Russian IT firm.
[03:52:06.758 --> 03:52:07.518]  Right?
[03:52:07.518 --> 03:52:12.081]  Right away they would say, well, how could you hire a Russian IT firm even if they're Russian-American citizens?
[03:52:12.081 --> 03:52:15.043]  That would be big controversy.
[03:52:15.043 --> 03:52:17.344]  Pakistan funds terrorism.
[03:52:17.344 --> 03:52:19.626]  Pakistan is pro-terrorism.
[03:52:19.626 --> 03:52:23.108]  Pakistan hid Bin Laden for years.
[03:52:23.108 --> 03:52:27.851]  They're not an ally of America and anybody telling you they are is lying to you.
[03:52:27.851 --> 03:52:31.693]  There's a major terrorist contingent within Pakistan.
[03:52:31.693 --> 03:52:32.554]  So why then
[03:52:33.723 --> 03:52:47.250]  Are people who are connected, perhaps, to terrorists in Pakistan, and we don't know the full story yet, but we do know that the Awan brothers did have access to Deborah Wasserman Schultz's passwords.
[03:52:47.250 --> 03:52:48.871]  It showed up in the WikiLeaks.
[03:52:48.871 --> 03:52:54.233]  They had access to passwords, they had access to all the information, and, and,
[03:52:56.786 --> 03:52:59.588]  They had access to the Republican emails too.
[03:52:59.588 --> 03:53:05.313]  That's why the Republicans have not been pushing the story and why it's up to us, the real journalists and the real news, to push the story.
[03:53:05.313 --> 03:53:09.597]  The Republicans don't want it out there either because the Ewan brothers knew about what they were up to.
[03:53:10.509 --> 03:53:13.651]  So there's been an arrest, and let's read that statement.
[03:53:13.651 --> 03:53:17.194]  Because, I mean, this is just so typical these days.
[03:53:17.194 --> 03:53:25.340]  The Ewan Brothers lawyer's statement, if we could get that pulled up on the screen, that'd be really helpful, so I can read it off the screen.
[03:53:25.340 --> 03:53:36.468]  So the lawyer goes, the attacks of Mr. Ewan and his family began as part of a conspiracy theory, an anti-Muslim bigotry.
[03:53:36.468 --> 03:53:37.910]  That's how you know the guy
[03:53:39.130 --> 03:53:39.530]  Right?
[03:53:39.530 --> 03:53:46.273]  That's how you know the guy is probably wanted for something because they want it and they throw in Pizzagate.
[03:53:46.273 --> 03:53:55.397]  The targets are not just coming from the ultra right-wing Pizzagate media outlets, but the Department of Justice is investigating it too.
[03:53:55.397 --> 03:54:01.099]  Now we have the Department of Justice showing up with a complaint about disclosure on a modest real estate matter.
[03:54:01.099 --> 03:54:02.820]  Okay, I'm a lawyer.
[03:54:02.820 --> 03:54:04.600]  I've done criminal defense work.
[03:54:04.600 --> 03:54:05.941]  I've done white-collar criminal defense work.
[03:54:05.941 --> 03:54:08.022]  Let me translate this for you.
[03:54:10.347 --> 03:54:11.528]  Real estate matter?
[03:54:11.528 --> 03:54:17.894]  Well, what do you do when you're paid a lot of money or you want to hide a lot of money?
[03:54:17.894 --> 03:54:26.442]  Again, we're going to have to read the indictment, but I'm just telling you as a lawyer, here's what I'm reading in between the line is a real estate matter.
[03:54:26.442 --> 03:54:31.627]  Well, why would you be guilty of a crime related to a real estate matter?
[03:54:31.627 --> 03:54:34.029]  Usually that means that money is being shifted around.
[03:54:34.029 --> 03:54:35.311]  And again, I'm not saying
[03:54:36.710 --> 03:54:46.237]  That Mr. A1 has laundered money, but I'm saying he was arrested by the feds, he was caught with a bunch of cash, and he was trying to leave the country.
[03:54:46.237 --> 03:54:46.797]  Right?
[03:54:46.797 --> 03:54:50.060]  So let's just deal with the realm of facts.
[03:54:50.060 --> 03:54:58.346]  He was caught trying to leave the country, that is why the FBI moved on him, and I got word from my sources that they were actually monitoring him and
[03:54:59.608 --> 03:55:01.409]  They didn't want to arrest him that quickly.
[03:55:01.409 --> 03:55:04.130]  They actually had to take action because he was leaving the country.
[03:55:04.130 --> 03:55:08.431]  So they're saying it was because of a modest real estate matter.
[03:55:08.431 --> 03:55:10.472]  That's coming from Mr. Ewan's lawyer.
[03:55:10.472 --> 03:55:13.333]  So that makes me really wonder what is actually going on.
[03:55:13.333 --> 03:55:15.473]  What is he also saying?
[03:55:15.473 --> 03:55:23.516]  Mr. Ewan's family is presently staying with extended family in Pakistan because he and his wife are both abruptly and unjustly fired.
[03:55:23.516 --> 03:55:25.437]  Leaving them without a reliable source of income.
[03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:32.323]  He was making $165,000 as a part-time employee.
[03:55:32.323 --> 03:55:33.944]  What were they doing with that money?
[03:55:33.944 --> 03:55:39.067]  Deborah Wasserman Schultz had said she doesn't know anything about this guy.
[03:55:39.067 --> 03:55:44.871]  He was a part-time employee, but he was paid $165,000 as a part-time employee.
[03:55:44.871 --> 03:55:46.893]  I don't know anybody here listening.
[03:55:46.893 --> 03:55:52.316]  How many people listening or watching were ever paid $165,000 for a part-time job?
[03:55:52.316 --> 03:55:54.017]  So they were paid massive amounts of money.
[03:55:54.017 --> 03:55:55.318]  I think they made over $300,000 from the contract.
[03:55:58.407 --> 03:56:00.889]  Who knows what's going on.
[03:56:00.889 --> 03:56:03.351]  So he goes to say that's why they were leaving him.
[03:56:03.351 --> 03:56:06.974]  Right-wing bloggers were beginning to harass them.
[03:56:06.974 --> 03:56:08.034]  So we already know the narrative.
[03:56:08.034 --> 03:56:11.697]  He attempted to travel this week to see his family for the first time in months.
[03:56:11.697 --> 03:56:14.479]  The government had been informed he would travel.
[03:56:14.479 --> 03:56:17.282]  So this is really fascinating.
[03:56:17.282 --> 03:56:19.523]  The total spend job.
[03:56:19.523 --> 03:56:20.644]  Hastily arrested.
[03:56:20.644 --> 03:56:22.085]  We had all this cash.
[03:56:22.085 --> 03:56:22.766]  So wait a minute.
[03:56:24.091 --> 03:56:35.440]  If he and his wife were, and this is, you know, just thinking about it like a lawyer, if this lawyer is saying that Mr. Ewan and his wife lost their job, then why was he caught with a bunch of cash in the airport?
[03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:36.461]  Well, I thought he didn't have any money.
[03:56:36.461 --> 03:56:38.963]  I thought he couldn't pay living expenses.
[03:56:38.963 --> 03:56:44.467]  So he has to leave the country because he doesn't have any money, but he's caught with a bunch of cash.
[03:56:45.328 --> 03:56:46.309]  Leaving the country.
[03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:48.030]  So which one is it?
[03:56:48.030 --> 03:56:50.952]  This is a really poorly worded statement.
[03:56:50.952 --> 03:56:57.336]  I thought it was fake, actually, at first, because when I read this, I thought this is a this is a bad lawyer.
[03:56:57.336 --> 03:57:04.861]  You know, I don't know why anybody would really I would not release a statement like this about a client facing really serious federal charges.
[03:57:04.861 --> 03:57:11.225]  So I looked it up because I was like, I can't believe this is this is real, that they would actually that they would actually post it.
[03:57:11.225 --> 03:57:12.887]  But then I went on to law firm website.
[03:57:13.627 --> 03:57:14.267]  And found it.
[03:57:14.267 --> 03:57:16.008]  Because to me, this is madness.
[03:57:16.008 --> 03:57:21.570]  They're saying that Pete's the gate... What does that have to do with anything?
[03:57:21.570 --> 03:57:31.395]  Pete's the gate, anti-Muslim bigotry, right-wing bloggers, fired... It's like buzzword bingo in this statement.
[03:57:31.395 --> 03:57:34.276]  I don't know what their strategy is, other than...
[03:57:35.612 --> 03:57:38.534]  They have a lot of dirt on probably Paul Ryan.
[03:57:38.534 --> 03:57:41.656]  They probably know the truth about Paul Ryan, which not many people do.
[03:57:41.656 --> 03:57:44.699]  They know the truth about the Democrats, the DNC leaks.
[03:57:44.699 --> 03:57:50.923]  So the lawyer is probably sending out a message because again, you should never issue a statement like this on behalf of a client.
[03:57:50.923 --> 03:57:59.510]  The lawyer is definitely sending a message out to Congress that the Ewan brothers do have all of their secrets and they will release the secret.
[03:57:59.510 --> 03:58:02.071]  So are they blackmail victims?
[03:58:03.012 --> 03:58:06.233]  Deborah Washington Schultz, or was she blackmailing people?
[03:58:06.233 --> 03:58:18.497]  Did she use the Ewan Brothers to dig through the emails of Republican congressional leaders so that she could blackmail people because you find out all the secrets about the drugs and the orgies and everything?
[03:58:18.497 --> 03:58:20.038]  I don't know, but we're going to keep investigating it.
