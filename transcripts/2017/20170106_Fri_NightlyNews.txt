[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.223]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:24.148]  It is Friday, January 6th, 2017 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:25.150]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.798 --> 00:00:32.040]  A mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.402]  We look at the shifting story.
[00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.826]  Now the airline denies he was on the plane or that anyone checked in a gun.
[00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:47.012]  And less than two months ago, the alleged shooter went to an FBI office in Alaska and said he was being forced to fight for ISIS.
[00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:48.374]  What's going on here?
[00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:56.240]  Then, NBC and the Washington Post present anonymous sources about the Rooskies releasing the truth about Hillary and the DNC.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.063]  And we learn they were fed info by U.S.
[00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:03.286]  intelligence agencies a full day before Trump got a briefing.
[00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:04.707]  Pure politics.
[00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:11.353]  And, in the wake of the horrific racial attack in Chicago yesterday, Obama says race relations have gotten better.
[00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:19.021]  He has created an environment where blacks are more convinced today that white people hate them than any other time in history.
[00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:22.084]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:08.716]  The latest updates on the mass shooting that took place today in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
[00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:16.723]  26-year-old Esteban Santiago shot and killed five people, wounded eight others at the Fort Lauderdale Airport.
[00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:18.525]  He had an active U.S.
[00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:19.526]  military ID.
[00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:24.831]  He opened fire at a baggage carousel there at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
[00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:31.416]  And a lot of people were sort of seen today on the television scrambling there on the tarmac.
[00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:46.908]  What we know about this man thus far is that apparently he collected his luggage from the carousel and then loaded the weapon in the bathroom and then went out and were shooting people execution style.
[00:03:47.668 --> 00:03:50.870]  Well, now there's kind of some conflicting stories coming out.
[00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.773]  Air Canada says that they have no record of this Florida suspect on any of their flights.
[00:03:56.234 --> 00:04:03.478]  As well, they say they have no record of any checked guns on any of the flights to Fort Lauderdale.
[00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.981]  So they're saying that he came in from a flight from Canada.
[00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:09.922]  So there's just a little bit of a discrepancy there.
[00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:11.644]  And then also,
[00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:16.369]  Once again, we have someone who was known to the authorities.
[00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:28.243]  Apparently, in November of 2016, he went to the FBI headquarters in Anchorage, Alaska, and said that he was being forced to fight for ISIS.
[00:04:28.723 --> 00:04:34.545]  At the time, they sent him to a hospital there for a psychological examination.
[00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:35.866]  They sent him to the psych hospital.
[00:04:36.286 --> 00:04:38.967]  So here, he is still in possession of his weapons.
[00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:41.868]  He's carrying them on a plane with him.
[00:04:41.888 --> 00:04:48.591]  He also had apparently been investigated by Homeland Security investigators for child porn.
[00:04:48.891 --> 00:04:55.214]  They, at the time, seized three weapons and a computer, but there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute him at the time.
[00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:58.896]  Now, the suspect was not hurt in this incident.
[00:04:58.976 --> 00:05:04.499]  He just laid on the ground and was ready to be taken away after he ran out of ammunition.
[00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:11.043]  This story is still developing, so we will have all the updates throughout the weekend on any new information that comes in.
[00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:24.391]  But, you know, we just had a flashback from the Brussels attack last year, where they were talking about the fact that now it was time to start moving these security checkpoints and these scanners outside of the airport
[00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:33.654]  So indeed here, now that this happened at the baggage claim at the carousel, this is going to of course affect the way that people are allowed to bring guns on flights with them as well.
[00:05:33.674 --> 00:05:36.475]  They're going to be moving these security checkpoints outside of the airport.
[00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:37.335]  Absolutely.
[00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:45.098]  And the authorities cannot conclude at this time if there is a much more sinister motive behind this attack.
[00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:47.459]  Was he indeed being directed by ISIS?
[00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.840]  Was he having psychiatric problems thinking that he was being
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.721]  Controlled by ISIS.
[00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:54.622]  We do not know at this time.
[00:05:54.803 --> 00:06:01.107]  We can't say for sure if it was an act of terrorism or if this is just another lone wolf or what it is.
[00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:04.269]  So we'll have updates throughout the weekend.
[00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:13.876]  Now I'm joined in studio by Darren McBreen and we want to draw your attention to what was to be the big story of Friday, this Intel report.
[00:06:14.377 --> 00:06:15.718]  Now this is the U.S.
[00:06:15.778 --> 00:06:19.841]  intelligence community's declassified report that they just released today.
[00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:36.200]  Concluding, with their very high level of confidence, no evidence, that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign aimed at hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.
[00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:43.357]  And after this hearing, we're no closer to finding out the truth than we were a month ago, a week ago, yesterday.
[00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:53.139]  I mean, they are saying that they have overwhelming evidence that proves without a doubt that the Russians hacked the DNC in favor of Donald Trump to win the elections, what have you.
[00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:54.800]  And like I said, there's still no proof.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.680]  They're saying it's an anonymous source within the CIA.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.480]  All right.
[00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:01.141]  And I thought it was interesting.
[00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:12.749]  The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, he was asked where the intelligence sources came from and his response was extremely interesting.
[00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:13.210]  Check it out.
[00:07:15.712 --> 00:07:28.960]  So as far as the Russian hacks go, I know normally you can't discuss sources and methods and how you guys are getting intelligence, but can you at least characterize the sort of intelligence that's coming in that proves that this was a Russian hack?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.123]  Is it digital fingerprints that you're tracing back to a computer in Russian possession?
[00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:37.725]  Is it human sourcing that you're intercepting phone calls?
[00:07:37.765 --> 00:07:38.466]  Where's the proof?
[00:07:38.506 --> 00:07:39.126]  Where's the proof?
[00:07:40.547 --> 00:07:41.327]  Yeah.
[00:07:41.508 --> 00:07:42.928]  Where's the confidence coming from?
[00:07:42.948 --> 00:07:52.132]  Well, I'm obviously quite limited in what I can say from here, but I think there are a couple of things that I can point to that I think... Look at your notes.
[00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:52.712]  Look at your notes.
[00:07:53.413 --> 00:07:55.233]  That I think answer the questions that you've raised.
[00:07:55.313 --> 00:07:56.394]  It's essentially two.
[00:07:56.774 --> 00:08:08.119]  The first is the statement that was issued by the intelligence community in October of 2016, before the election, making clear that Russia was
[00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:11.344]  Interfering in our election.
[00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:15.607]  Represented the consensus view of 17 different intelligence agencies.
[00:08:15.707 --> 00:08:16.747]  How dare you question them?
[00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.329]  That's not usually the way intelligence works.
[00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:31.114]  That kind of unanimity of opinion, particularly when the stakes are so high, is notable.
[00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:40.598]  So it is notable, and because 17 different intelligence agencies agree, they are unified in their belief that it was the Russians.
[00:08:41.058 --> 00:08:45.481]  And when I heard that, it got me thinking about Colin Powell and his UN address.
[00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:56.888]  He said 16 US intelligence agencies all agreed, they were unified in their agreement, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:01.114]  If we had known the intelligence was wrong, we would not have gone into Iraq.
[00:09:01.754 --> 00:09:06.558]  But the intelligence community, all 16 agencies, assured us that it was right.
[00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.221]  My speech at the UN was based on that information.
[00:09:11.062 --> 00:09:13.464]  Every statement I make today is backed up by sources.
[00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:14.825]  Solid sources.
[00:09:15.466 --> 00:09:16.427]  These are not assertions.
[00:09:17.227 --> 00:09:21.391]  What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.
[00:09:21.971 --> 00:09:22.171]  Right.
[00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:28.010]  And this is once again James Comey that had this solid assessment.
[00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:37.574]  It was a personal assessment, but he said undoubtedly that's his assessment, that they had weapons of mass destruction, they were taking it over into Syria.
[00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:42.056]  But how dare you question the Central Intelligence Agency?
[00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:50.420]  And they're actually pushing that narrative out there that we are not patriotic, if we would rather believe Putin than these 17 intelligence agencies.
[00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:56.847]  Yeah, what was really scary, and we're going to play this clip next, Chuck Schumer, this sounded like a threat to me.
[00:09:56.907 --> 00:10:02.589]  This was a threat from Chuck Schumer to Donald Trump from the CIA.
[00:10:03.349 --> 00:10:08.711]  He's taking these shots, this antagonism is taunting to the intelligence community.
[00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:13.432]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:10:14.012 --> 00:10:19.454]  So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[00:10:19.674 --> 00:10:22.575]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were motivated to?
[00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:29.136]  I don't know, but from what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:33.117]  So we got a potential JFK situation on our hands?
[00:10:33.197 --> 00:10:37.178]  Donald Trump does not trust the CIA, and we have a lot of clips lined up.
[00:10:37.258 --> 00:10:38.058]  I want to play another one.
[00:10:38.719 --> 00:10:44.720]  He was approached by a Fox News reporter a few months ago and asked if he trusts the CIA.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.001]  Donald Trump says, not so much.
[00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:48.441]  Do you trust intelligence?
[00:10:49.874 --> 00:10:53.596]  Uh, not so much from the people that have been doing it for our country.
[00:10:53.616 --> 00:10:55.716]  I mean, look what's happened over the last 10 years.
[00:10:55.737 --> 00:10:57.077]  Look what's happened over the years.
[00:10:57.097 --> 00:10:59.278]  I mean, it's been catastrophic.
[00:10:59.438 --> 00:11:02.659]  And in fact, I won't use some of the people that are sort of your standards.
[00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:04.280]  You know, just use them, use them, use them.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.080]  Very easy to use them.
[00:11:05.921 --> 00:11:08.242]  But I won't use them because they've made such bad decisions.
[00:11:08.342 --> 00:11:11.683]  I mean, you look at Iraq, you look at the Middle East, it's a total powder keg.
[00:11:11.743 --> 00:11:14.884]  It's a, if we would have never touched it, it would have been a lot better.
[00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:18.746]  I mean, we would have been much better off, on top of which we've spent probably $4 trillion.
[00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:21.346]  Nobody even knows what we've spent.
[00:11:22.207 --> 00:11:25.627]  So, no, I have great people and General Flynn is one of them.
[00:11:26.287 --> 00:11:30.088]  Well, you know, and he's absolutely right there because I was making this comment yesterday.
[00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:33.409]  Why the hell are we still trusting what James Comey has to say?
[00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:39.191]  They're using the exact same people who gave us these faulty assessments that took us into war in Iraq.
[00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:40.991]  And then they say, oh, well, you know, we've
[00:11:41.291 --> 00:11:43.573]  Try to learn a lot so we won't make that mistake again.
[00:11:43.593 --> 00:11:52.022]  And yet here they are making it again and demanding that the American public believe their assessment because all 17 of the agencies are in agreement.
[00:11:52.062 --> 00:11:53.483]  But frankly that's not even true.
[00:11:53.523 --> 00:11:58.328]  If you go back, you can see where a lot of them didn't want to just really stand behind this 100%.
[00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:00.952]  And they come from anonymous sources.
[00:12:14.793 --> 00:12:23.275]  Drug trafficking in the United States, Benghazi, Kibana flight 455, 9-11, Google searched the 28 pages.
[00:12:23.335 --> 00:12:24.396]  They are a rogue agency.
[00:12:24.716 --> 00:12:27.157]  Donald Trump has every reason not to believe them.
[00:12:27.897 --> 00:12:28.797]  Okay, another clip.
[00:12:29.177 --> 00:12:30.077]  What about Harry Reid?
[00:12:30.097 --> 00:12:36.279]  Remember, Harry Reid said that he was going to give Donald Trump false intelligence reports.
[00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:37.339]  Let's check it out.
[00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:39.120]  Harry Reid actually said this publicly.
[00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:41.933]  It's obvious that he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:12:42.753 --> 00:12:45.555]  It's obvious he can't control his mind or his tongue.
[00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:57.683]  And what I've suggested, if now, because he's the nominee for the party, and he's entitled to briefings from the CIA, for example, I said publicly, give him fake briefings.
[00:12:58.104 --> 00:12:59.044]  Pretend you're briefing him.
[00:12:59.084 --> 00:13:01.226]  Don't tell him anything that you don't want to get out.
[00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:03.107]  That's how I feel about it.
[00:13:03.127 --> 00:13:05.509]  I think the man is a loose cannon.
[00:13:06.249 --> 00:13:08.351]  I think he's done so much to hurt our country.
[00:13:09.574 --> 00:13:11.595]  With our international relations already.
[00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:15.217]  But as a Republican nominee, isn't he entitled to get those briefings?
[00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:16.358]  Give him fake briefings.
[00:13:16.939 --> 00:13:17.699]  What does that even mean?
[00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:19.280]  It means he won't tell me stuff.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.201]  He won't know the difference.
[00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:22.342]  You're basically telling the intelligence community to lie.
[00:13:22.362 --> 00:13:22.702]  Fake news.
[00:13:22.882 --> 00:13:23.462]  Fake news.
[00:13:23.483 --> 00:13:24.103]  Yep, fake news.
[00:13:24.143 --> 00:13:25.304]  Give the president fake news.
[00:13:25.324 --> 00:13:27.305]  I'm not going to lie to you, but I still have to tell you everything.
[00:13:28.277 --> 00:13:29.797]  It's totally unbelievable.
[00:13:29.817 --> 00:13:35.478]  So I guess this is the six ways to Sunday that they can get back at him is by giving him some fake news to the president.
[00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:36.898]  But you're absolutely right.
[00:13:36.938 --> 00:13:39.419]  He does not trust the CIA and he has very good reason to.
[00:13:39.499 --> 00:13:40.999]  A lot of us have very good reason to.
[00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:43.500]  You pointed out quite a few great examples.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:49.761]  Trump is of course questioning why the heck hasn't the DNC allowed the FBI to access their servers?
[00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:57.342]  If you truly believe that the Russians hacked in and you want to find these cyber fingerprints as some actual evidence to present your case,
[00:13:57.842 --> 00:14:00.744]  Why not allow the FBI to actually access these servers?
[00:14:00.764 --> 00:14:04.628]  Is it because you're, you know, afraid of what they're gonna find out you all were up to?
[00:14:04.768 --> 00:14:06.229]  Or was there no evidence there?
[00:14:06.489 --> 00:14:14.576]  And then frankly, we also have some cyber pros, this is coming out of McClatchy DC, who are backing up Trump's skepticism of the Russian hack.
[00:14:14.616 --> 00:14:17.318]  Yeah, you don't hear about that, at least on the mainstream.
[00:14:17.438 --> 00:14:23.060]  We have these cyber pros and they're saying, look, once malware gets out there, it's out there.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.221]  It's up for grabs.
[00:14:24.241 --> 00:14:25.481]  You have no control over the malware.
[00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:30.023]  And Julian Assange from WikiLeaks, he has said from day one that it was not the Russians.
[00:14:30.243 --> 00:14:31.363]  It was not the Russians.
[00:14:31.423 --> 00:14:32.944]  He said it from the very beginning.
[00:14:33.504 --> 00:14:38.768]  We know from our sources that it was more than likely disgruntled U.S.
[00:14:38.868 --> 00:14:40.749]  intelligence agencies from within.
[00:14:40.889 --> 00:14:42.310]  It was an inside job.
[00:14:42.571 --> 00:14:44.872]  These guys are scared to death of Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:44.892 --> 00:14:46.253]  They don't want World War III.
[00:14:46.614 --> 00:14:48.695]  So it wasn't a hacked document.
[00:14:49.336 --> 00:14:54.019]  These documents were simply released by disgruntled officials within the intelligence community.
[00:14:54.039 --> 00:15:00.982]  Well if you could just see how much the globalists, the establishment, was scrambling to try to destroy and delegitimize Donald Trump.
[00:15:01.582 --> 00:15:04.584]  Just trying so much to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[00:15:04.604 --> 00:15:08.966]  I mean they had a full-on agenda that they can see is just crumbling before their eyes.
[00:15:09.266 --> 00:15:16.609]  So they are scrambling and they literally would rather take us to war with Russia than allow their long-term agenda to be foiled.
[00:15:17.422 --> 00:15:19.723]  What you're saying now is, what is more important?
[00:15:20.683 --> 00:15:27.765]  Who hacked, if there was a hack, we know it was a release, but who hacked the DNC or what were the contents within the documents?
[00:15:28.165 --> 00:15:28.926]  What is more important?
[00:15:28.986 --> 00:15:33.207]  We're actually seeing the corruption that's there, but that's not what's important here.
[00:15:33.247 --> 00:15:43.210]  We don't need to know how corrupt the system is, how the establishment media is totally colluding with the globalists to push through this agenda while they think we're all just a bunch of idiots.
[00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.711]  You can't handle the truth!
[00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:06.533]  That's right.
[00:16:06.553 --> 00:16:10.537]  Well, I've got one more clip I want to share with you and I think we can close this segment out with this.
[00:16:25.433 --> 00:16:32.318]  And this is for anyone who says that a US president or a senator or a congressman can't have someone killed.
[00:16:32.698 --> 00:16:37.701]  I thought that Chuck Schumer, I thought that was chilling what he just said and I think it was a warning to Donald Trump.
[00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:47.448]  But for those of you who think that our government is not capable of taking someone out, here is a classic scene from The Godfather.
[00:16:48.528 --> 00:16:50.970]  My father's no different than any other powerful man.
[00:16:52.931 --> 00:16:53.572]  Any man who's
[00:16:54.778 --> 00:16:56.039]  Responsible for other people.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.962]  Like a senator or a president.
[00:17:00.063 --> 00:17:01.744]  You know how naive you sound.
[00:17:01.844 --> 00:17:02.184]  Why?
[00:17:02.665 --> 00:17:04.987]  Senators and presidents don't have men killed.
[00:17:06.889 --> 00:17:07.089]  Oh.
[00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:09.571]  Who's being naive, Kay?
[00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:16.331]  What's wrong?
[00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:20.433]  You don't like a small group of psychos hijacking your country?
[00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:27.616]  Well, become President of the United States and change it from the... Never mind.
[00:17:27.636 --> 00:17:32.838]  Three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:17:32.898 --> 00:17:36.739]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.221]  Do you have any people paid by the CIA?
[00:17:45.427 --> 00:17:49.073]  Who are working for television networks.
[00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:01.688]  Had been contacted by the CIA.
[00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:11.461]  As a matter of fact, by the time I became the head of the whole news and public affairs operation in 1954, ships had been established and I was told about them and asked if I'd carry on with them.
[00:18:11.721 --> 00:18:15.226]  We're really talking about intelligence at the highest levels of the U.S.
[00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:17.990]  government, setting the broad direction for the nation.
[00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.271]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:18:20.451 --> 00:18:20.992]  Think about it.
[00:18:21.212 --> 00:18:26.975]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:32.859]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:37.462]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources.
[00:18:37.982 --> 00:18:44.966]  Or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:48.008]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:18:48.188 --> 00:18:50.669]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.432]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:18:55.872 --> 00:18:56.433]  Think about it.
[00:18:56.653 --> 00:19:00.055]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.
[00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.320]  Silver Bullet Coil Silver, 50% off.
[00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.881]  Brain Force Plus, 33% off.

[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.
[00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.868]  And then let me finish up with this, the Coup De Grace.
[00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:23.630]  Store-wide free shipping until New Year's Day.
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:21:26.812 --> 00:21:36.637]  On the non-GMO heirloom seeds, and the Trump is my president shirts, and Hillary for prison 2017 shirts, and deport George Soros the goblin globalist specials.
[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.
[00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:45.500]  50 to 30 percent off on scores of items and all of these are super high quality products.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.501]  They help fund the spearhead in the fight against the globalists and they are game changers.
[00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.342]  We couldn't have built this operation without you.
[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:44.921]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsTore.com

[00:23:12.921 --> 00:23:15.264]  Obama wanted ISIS to grow, close quote.
[00:23:15.904 --> 00:23:16.985]  They just want it to grow.
[00:23:18.621 --> 00:23:20.322]  It's Al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:23:20.382 --> 00:23:21.782]  It's an invasion of Syria.
[00:23:22.083 --> 00:23:23.263]  That's been declassified.
[00:23:23.483 --> 00:23:39.811]  And they sit there with this trillion pound creature in the living room, telling us we're stupid and conspiracy theorists, when I have Colonel Schaeffer, the former head of the anti-Al-Qaeda operation, with over a thousand people under him, trying to hunt down Al-Qaeda for four years.
[00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:46.274]  And I've had, you name it, congressmen on, Walter Jones, everybody that's seen the secret documents.
[00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:50.617]  And if you think that's high up, imagine who I talk to on the telephone.
[00:23:50.977 --> 00:23:52.338]  As high as it goes.
[00:23:52.678 --> 00:23:53.738]  And everybody already knows that.
[00:23:53.798 --> 00:23:57.219]  When they're doing the big invasion of Syria, calling it a civil war, just like they've done in Libya.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.581]  The West starts a civil war with jihadis, out of Saudi Arabia and other areas.
[00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:04.102]  But now in Syria, it's easier for troops to get to.
[00:24:04.142 --> 00:24:05.942]  They're coming in from all over the world.
[00:24:06.402 --> 00:24:14.625]  Jihadis from Russia, jihadis from America, the UK, Australia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Serbia, Albania.
[00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:16.166]  I mean, they're just pouring in.
[00:24:16.806 --> 00:24:19.048]  For the big jihad to get their own house, get their own land.
[00:24:19.268 --> 00:24:21.890]  You come take the country, you get houses, swimming pools, everything.
[00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.291]  You get the businesses, the oil wells.
[00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:26.074]  Everything that Syria ever built in thousands of years, you get it.
[00:24:26.574 --> 00:24:30.537]  Oh yes, the Council on Foreign Relations private meetings that Hillary and John Kerry were at.
[00:24:30.938 --> 00:24:32.279]  You think somebody recorded those?
[00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:34.180]  You think somebody recorded those?
[00:24:34.381 --> 00:24:34.561]  Us?
[00:24:34.921 --> 00:24:37.243]  You think we don't have people everywhere, jackass?
[00:24:37.603 --> 00:24:38.624]  It's all out there.
[00:24:39.064 --> 00:24:41.667]  So damaging, it may destroy this country.
[00:24:42.327 --> 00:24:45.989]  But before you're able to strangle it for sure and destroy it, it's going to be released.
[00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.810]  All of it!
[00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.012]  So, you broke your deal with Trump, you weasels.
[00:24:50.812 --> 00:24:52.853]  Because a lot of this probably doesn't need to come out so bad.
[00:24:52.873 --> 00:24:55.575]  It needs to be reformed, taken care of, people need to be dealt with.
[00:24:55.595 --> 00:24:57.136]  A lot of folks need to get cancer.
[00:24:57.556 --> 00:24:58.817]  We're the real fast acting type.
[00:24:59.337 --> 00:25:00.178]  They need to agree to it.
[00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:02.755]  But no, you're going to go on to the end.
[00:25:02.775 --> 00:25:03.276]  You're not going to stop.
[00:25:03.296 --> 00:25:06.038]  You're going to try to keep trying to sabotage things once Trump gets in.
[00:25:06.078 --> 00:25:06.699]  We understand that.
[00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:08.180]  We know you're not going to go away.
[00:25:08.461 --> 00:25:10.402]  We understand you're never going to back off.
[00:25:10.482 --> 00:25:10.983]  We get it.
[00:25:11.363 --> 00:25:12.544]  And so you want to have a big fight?
[00:25:12.564 --> 00:25:13.485]  You want to have a big civil war?
[00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:14.306]  Feel your hand!
[00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:14.766]  Go ahead!
[00:25:15.728 --> 00:25:18.349]  You don't think everybody's been running around forever getting ready for this?
[00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:20.489]  You stupid, arrogant people.
[00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:25.130]  You'd hijacked the top of the country, you'd looted us, you'd robbed us seven ways to Sunday, but you had to rub it in.
[00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:31.631]  You had to get up on TV like a bunch of megalomaniacs and go, and your kids belong to us and the state and we ripped you off of Obamacare and got the public stump!
[00:25:32.711 --> 00:25:39.113]  A bunch of weird chicken-neck Harvard guys having little wimp celebrations about how they destroyed America and how they were better than us.
[00:25:39.393 --> 00:25:40.413]  Yeah, you're about to find out.
[00:25:41.013 --> 00:25:42.793]  So here's the big announcement, just in total.
[00:25:43.493 --> 00:25:45.594]  It's a labyrinth of evidence.
[00:25:46.114 --> 00:25:47.374]  The globalists are losing everywhere.
[00:25:47.894 --> 00:25:50.895]  People don't want this tyrannical New World Order global government model.
[00:25:51.555 --> 00:25:53.535]  We're not even debating whether world government's good or bad.
[00:25:53.575 --> 00:25:55.076]  Let's just cut that out for academic reasons.
[00:25:55.916 --> 00:26:07.838]  This world government is nothing but a corporate looting arm which admits it wants a post-industrial world, the end of nation states, only trade corridors, 99% of stuff collapses, and then the elites have high-tech city states.
[00:26:08.638 --> 00:26:11.621]  That are heavily guarded and controlled and everybody else lives in squalor.
[00:26:11.641 --> 00:26:14.103]  And people say, oh, there's a movie about that.
[00:26:14.123 --> 00:26:15.224]  There's books, Hunger Games.
[00:26:15.605 --> 00:26:16.886]  I told you this 20 years ago.
[00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:19.208]  I put it in films 15 years ago.
[00:26:19.528 --> 00:26:22.010]  No, that's art imitating life, folks.
[00:26:22.271 --> 00:26:23.192]  It's what's going on.
[00:26:23.772 --> 00:26:24.613]  So here's the big announcement.
[00:26:24.853 --> 00:26:26.614]  WikiLeaks and a whole bunch of other groups.
[00:26:26.654 --> 00:26:28.315]  WikiLeaks is just some branding name.
[00:26:28.495 --> 00:26:31.197]  Obama and the globalists desperately want to keep Trump out of office.
[00:26:31.437 --> 00:26:32.958]  Globalism is failing all over the world.
[00:26:33.379 --> 00:26:35.820]  Nationalism and populism is surging.
[00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:40.824]  The elite in every major publication admit to themselves they are burning down in a day.
[00:26:40.904 --> 00:26:42.045]  Babylon's burning in a day.
[00:26:42.365 --> 00:26:46.528]  I mean, the next few years is like a minute in the scheme of human history.
[00:26:46.928 --> 00:26:48.009]  So a day is like a year.
[00:26:48.449 --> 00:26:50.111]  So there's this war going on currently.
[00:26:50.956 --> 00:26:54.257]  And they've told him, OK, all this horrible stuff, we don't want to release more.
[00:26:54.718 --> 00:26:55.138]  Stop it.
[00:26:55.218 --> 00:26:55.898]  Admit your beat.
[00:26:56.058 --> 00:26:56.619]  Back off.
[00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:58.079]  Let us cut the taxes.
[00:26:58.099 --> 00:26:59.260]  Let us resuscitate the country.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.262]  Just stop this ritual of abusing America for your own personal weird leftist mind control.
[00:27:04.582 --> 00:27:04.982]  Stop it.
[00:27:05.542 --> 00:27:07.083]  And they went, OK, we're going to stop it.
[00:27:07.443 --> 00:27:11.345]  And then came right back attacking behind the scenes and now publicly.
[00:27:11.645 --> 00:27:15.447]  And so when they say, oh, there's Russian agents hacked us, the kernel of truth is
[00:27:16.247 --> 00:27:25.101]  Our military and our patriots checkmated Obama with the proof of this and said, you let us now take these groups out or we're going to release all the info.
[00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:26.863]  And again, Obama said, OK, I will.
[00:27:27.044 --> 00:27:28.466]  But then always sabotage the missions.
[00:27:28.666 --> 00:27:29.267]  It's the same deal.
[00:27:29.407 --> 00:27:30.629]  OK, I'll back off.
[00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:31.490]  But then he never really does.
[00:27:32.051 --> 00:27:35.273]  So they've been through this six or seven times now with Obama and the globalists.
[00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:37.594]  So the Russians said, OK, we'll talk to your military.
[00:27:38.034 --> 00:27:39.415]  Sure, we'll talk to your chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[00:27:39.635 --> 00:27:40.856]  Sure, we'll talk to all the heads of your military.
[00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:41.876]  Oh, you want us to come in?
[00:27:41.896 --> 00:27:42.656]  You know we're already there.
[00:27:42.676 --> 00:27:44.978]  You know we're already losing thousands of troops every few months.
[00:27:45.478 --> 00:27:47.479]  Oh, sure, you're not going to give us a problem if Air Force comes in.
[00:27:47.959 --> 00:27:49.320]  OK, we'll divide the country in three parts.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.400]  We'll even go with your previous plan.
[00:27:50.661 --> 00:27:51.901]  Sure, we just want to stop World War III.
[00:27:51.941 --> 00:27:52.582]  Boom, we're coming in.
[00:27:52.622 --> 00:27:52.962]  They come in.
[00:27:53.382 --> 00:27:54.242]  And they join U.S.
[00:27:54.282 --> 00:27:58.885]  military forces now there who know everything they do has been given to the ISIS people.
[00:27:59.585 --> 00:28:01.146]  We're good to go.
[00:28:23.527 --> 00:28:26.673]  We've got congressmen introducing bills to stop funding ISIS.
[00:28:26.693 --> 00:28:28.777]  We have Democrats coming out and speaking out as well.
[00:28:28.817 --> 00:28:34.829]  We have Democrats coming out and saying, Obama, we got hacked two years ago in the big giant...
[00:28:35.905 --> 00:28:37.085]  Hack of all time.
[00:28:37.105 --> 00:28:37.626]  14 million U.S.
[00:28:37.646 --> 00:28:39.866]  governments' names, infos, code names, everything.
[00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:40.887]  All their operatives.
[00:28:40.947 --> 00:28:41.787]  Total roll up.
[00:28:42.447 --> 00:28:43.828]  There's no way they just got that.
[00:28:43.868 --> 00:28:45.028]  You gave it to them, didn't you?
[00:28:45.468 --> 00:28:45.928]  Oh, that's right.
[00:28:46.109 --> 00:28:47.209]  Oh, the Russians are getting us.
[00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.829]  Oh, the Russians.
[00:28:48.069 --> 00:28:52.531]  Obama rolled up our entire intelligence network worldwide to the shycoms.
[00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:56.772]  That's why the intelligence agencies are in total war mode against Obama.
[00:28:56.932 --> 00:28:58.713]  Because they realize it's a triple cross.
[00:29:03.447 --> 00:29:13.492]  Now most of you know that the mainstream media has been very critical of anyone suggesting that Barack Obama's birth certificate might be a fraud.
[00:29:13.812 --> 00:29:16.053]  And believe me, they got the memo.
[00:29:16.373 --> 00:29:19.014]  I'm talking about the people who work for the mainstream media.
[00:29:19.314 --> 00:29:22.856]  They know that Obama's birth certificate is off limits.
[00:29:23.476 --> 00:29:24.256]  You don't go there.
[00:29:24.637 --> 00:29:28.878]  Unless, of course, someone like Donald Trump shows up and starts asking questions.
[00:29:29.459 --> 00:29:39.263]  Or if Alex Jones brings it up, that's when the establishment media goes into full attack mode and they come to Obama's rescue.
[00:29:40.003 --> 00:29:51.745]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website InfoWars, which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[00:29:52.265 --> 00:29:57.026]  Jones can take credit for spearheading some of the most outrageous theories on the Internet.
[00:29:57.166 --> 00:30:04.687]  Jones' theories reach tens of millions each month and are now often echoed by the next president of the United States.
[00:30:05.187 --> 00:30:06.828]  Take President Obama's birth.
[00:30:07.308 --> 00:30:09.008]  Trump comes along and said,
[00:30:10.037 --> 00:30:16.600]  Now, I want you all to listen very carefully because what I'm about to say is very important and I want to be clear so there's no misunderstanding.
[00:30:27.543 --> 00:30:34.611]  We are not saying that Barack Obama was born outside of the United States and that he is not a US citizen.
[00:30:35.192 --> 00:30:40.578]  We're not even claiming that Communist Frank Marshall Davis is Barack Obama's father.
[00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:42.461]  Fact is, we just don't know.
[00:30:43.021 --> 00:30:48.143]  I personally believe Obama's father is Frank Marshall Davis, but this investigation does not prove that.
[00:30:48.604 --> 00:30:51.225]  What we do know is significant.
[00:30:51.705 --> 00:31:01.889]  Forensic evidence proves without a doubt that the official birth certificate belonging to Barack Obama, the President of the United States, is a fake.
[00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:10.253]  As far as the document is concerned, we had two different forensic experts, two different disciplines, two different continents review our information.
[00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:12.406]  And all came to the same conclusion.
[00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:14.187]  The document is completely fraudulent.
[00:31:14.287 --> 00:31:15.167]  It's inauthentic.
[00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.368]  It's not what it represents itself to be.
[00:31:17.889 --> 00:31:20.370]  What does this say about the mainstream news media?
[00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:25.372]  Because we've been covering this for a long time and they refuse to follow this.
[00:31:25.812 --> 00:31:30.715]  And I still, I expected at least a little more participation after this press conference.
[00:31:31.115 --> 00:31:32.636]  Why do you think they're not talking about it?
[00:31:33.316 --> 00:31:34.857]  Well, this information is devastating.
[00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:47.594]  And what you have to realize is this goes directly to document fraud and a fraudulent document being offered to the American people during an election cycle as evidence that I am good to go, you can vote for me.
[00:31:47.734 --> 00:31:48.995]  It's a federal offense, am I right?
[00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:52.216]  Oh my god, there's numerous federal offenses under Title 18.
[00:31:52.697 --> 00:31:55.078]  Somebody's looking at 40 years, somewhere along the line.
[00:31:55.218 --> 00:31:57.058]  You're not going to be able to refute this document.
[00:31:57.619 --> 00:31:58.139]  It's a fraud.
[00:32:00.188 --> 00:32:03.649]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:07.150]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:12.012]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:32:12.152 --> 00:32:14.933]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:20.975]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:32:21.195 --> 00:32:24.778]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:32:25.219 --> 00:32:27.801]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:32:27.901 --> 00:32:36.429]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:46.213]  is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:32:46.313 --> 00:32:51.455]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:32:51.955 --> 00:32:55.816]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:32:55.836 --> 00:32:57.757]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:32:57.837 --> 00:32:58.817]  Is it one world?
[00:32:58.857 --> 00:33:00.258]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:33:02.264 --> 00:33:03.586]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:33:04.207 --> 00:33:07.914]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:07.150]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.

[00:37:07.574 --> 00:37:10.657]  Well, Reverend Jesse Lee Peterson, it's great to be joined by you.
[00:37:10.857 --> 00:37:20.486]  I consider you the Yoda of racial discussions because these are obviously very, you know, emotional discussions and somehow you always manage to keep a cool and calm head.
[00:37:20.546 --> 00:37:24.469]  So here we are with Jesse Lee Peterson, the Yoda of racial discussions.
[00:37:24.509 --> 00:37:27.052]  And I wanted to have you on today, obviously, to talk about
[00:37:27.472 --> 00:37:33.677]  The hate crime video that went out on Facebook, all of the aftermath, all of the buildup to that.
[00:37:33.777 --> 00:37:36.660]  But first, Jesse, let's just, you know, let's just talk about this.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.581]  Let's get this out here.
[00:37:37.641 --> 00:37:39.182]  Obviously everyone's seen the video of now.
[00:37:39.522 --> 00:37:40.963]  What was your first reaction to this?
[00:37:40.984 --> 00:37:43.205]  You know, how did it, how did it kind of touch your heart?
[00:37:43.245 --> 00:37:46.949]  What were you thinking as you witnessed this and thought about what might come afterwards?
[00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.731]  I wasn't surprised at all.
[00:37:50.211 --> 00:38:03.475]  For the last 26 years, I've been trying to warn white Americans that the race war is already happening, except it's a one-sided war where black people are attacking white Americans around the country.
[00:38:03.935 --> 00:38:09.857]  You have to realize that not all, not all, not all, but most black people hate white folks, and they're angry at them.
[00:38:09.917 --> 00:38:12.518]  They blame white folks for their failure in life.
[00:38:13.158 --> 00:38:27.857]  The anger starts in the home, of course, due to the fact that most of them are born out of wedlock, so they're mad at their mothers and grandmothers who pass their anger down to their children, and instead of showing them how to overcome that anger by forgiving their parents,
[00:38:28.597 --> 00:38:33.522]  They're being told that it's the white man, it's racism, and white folks are trying to hold you back.
[00:38:33.562 --> 00:38:39.527]  So for generations and generations, you've seen black Americans taking their anger out on white folks.
[00:38:39.907 --> 00:38:44.912]  The knockout games, robbing and stealing from white folks.
[00:38:45.692 --> 00:38:53.059]  I remember there was a last summer sometime when black teenagers were going into white businesses in the daylight and just robbing them.
[00:38:53.779 --> 00:38:58.284]  And you have rape, and you haven't heard the media or anyone say anything about it.
[00:38:58.705 --> 00:39:08.415]  And I've been writing about this, talking about this, and telling white folks, if they don't start standing up and speaking up, each generation of Blacks will only get worse.
[00:39:08.896 --> 00:39:10.798]  And so this hate,
[00:39:11.298 --> 00:39:21.772]  That evil act that you saw in Chicago by the young, the four black thugs is just an example of how bad it has really gotten.
[00:39:22.252 --> 00:39:26.338]  And it's going to get worse if we don't deal with the anger of black Americans.
[00:39:26.918 --> 00:39:36.383]  And you know, I hate having to have discussions like this on the principle of skin color or race, but we have to because these issues are apparently still ahead of us.
[00:39:36.804 --> 00:39:46.229]  But where do you think the youth or where do you think people in black culture are getting these messages that the white man is to blame or hate the white man?
[00:39:46.249 --> 00:39:47.750]  Where are these messages coming from?
[00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.431]  Where are they getting these foundational beliefs?
[00:39:50.199 --> 00:40:05.492]  Well, over the last 50 to 60 years, they've gotten them from Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, Al Sharpton, the NAACP, Congressional Black Caucus, and most other black preachers who are not called by God but by their mama.
[00:40:05.852 --> 00:40:09.756]  They have been saying to black Americans, racism is an issue.
[00:40:10.476 --> 00:40:11.517]  White people hate you.
[00:40:11.697 --> 00:40:14.519]  They're trying to hold you back simply because you're black.
[00:40:15.059 --> 00:40:16.260]  And this is slavery.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.682]  This is part of slavery or aftermath of slavery.
[00:40:19.182 --> 00:40:24.946]  And then you bring Barack Obama in the White House for the last eight years, and that's all he's been talking about.
[00:40:25.327 --> 00:40:32.752]  He has created an environment where blacks are more convinced today that white people hate them than any other time in history.
[00:40:33.512 --> 00:40:42.981]  Barack Obama supports this radical, evil, hateful, agitative organization like Black Lives Matter, who are worse than the KKK.
[00:40:43.581 --> 00:40:50.888]  And as a matter of fact, Obama invited the heads of that organization to the White House several times, at least a couple times for sure.
[00:40:51.468 --> 00:41:04.812]  And so he sent out a message that black people are hated by white folks and you have these young black people in these universities and in the ghettos who have fallen for this lie and they are taking it out.
[00:41:04.852 --> 00:41:12.954]  We have seen them kill white cops around the country and so it's the black so-called leadership who are keeping this lie going forth.
[00:41:13.374 --> 00:41:16.995]  We all know by now there's just no such thing as racism.
[00:41:17.555 --> 00:41:18.837]  Racism is a lie.
[00:41:18.917 --> 00:41:21.600]  It's an illusion that's been made up by the race hustlers.
[00:41:22.221 --> 00:41:28.249]  Black Americans are suffering due to the destruction of the family and the lack of moral character.
[00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:31.133]  It has nothing to do with white folks at all.
[00:41:31.513 --> 00:41:35.458]  But it's the leadership that keeps this thing going, along with the liberal media.
[00:41:36.209 --> 00:41:43.253]  Yeah, and I don't think Barack Obama has invited the victim of the hate crime to the White House yet, at least as far as I know.
[00:41:43.313 --> 00:41:46.975]  As you mentioned, he has invited folks from the Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:41:47.836 --> 00:41:53.139]  But you know, it's amazing to me how the media has been able to dominate this paradigm.
[00:41:53.439 --> 00:42:00.263]  Because for me personally, growing up in school as a kid, high school, throughout my whole life, you know, me personally,
[00:42:00.783 --> 00:42:03.245]  I've never really had a problem with black people.
[00:42:03.345 --> 00:42:05.066]  They have never been racist towards me.
[00:42:05.206 --> 00:42:06.567]  I've never been racist towards them.
[00:42:07.187 --> 00:42:12.811]  People here at the office and everyday walks of life, black people and white people, the normal people just seem to get along.
[00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:17.474]  Like you said, this racism doesn't seem to exist on the level that they put it on.
[00:42:17.895 --> 00:42:30.303]  But how is it that the media, and I guess with Barack Obama too, how is it that they're able to just beat that reality out of us that we experience in day to day and then put this fake reality into our mindset?
[00:42:31.204 --> 00:42:36.047]  Well, when you're angry, you're cut off from the reality, real reality.
[00:42:36.588 --> 00:42:41.412]  When you're an angry person, it's hard to believe the truth and easy to believe the lie.
[00:42:41.952 --> 00:42:50.619]  And if you notice, over the last 50 years or so, the media, along with the race hustling so-called leadership, they have kept black Americans angry.
[00:42:51.139 --> 00:42:58.482]  They won't allow them to have a moment to examine themselves, to understand that their anger starts in the home first.
[00:42:58.502 --> 00:42:59.962]  It has nothing to do with white folk.
[00:43:00.322 --> 00:43:03.003]  They're constantly finding things that look like racism.
[00:43:03.383 --> 00:43:09.125]  For example, whenever there is a white on black situation, they're all over it.
[00:43:09.425 --> 00:43:13.187]  They tell you it's a white man who attacked black people.
[00:43:13.307 --> 00:43:14.387]  This is a hate crime.
[00:43:14.867 --> 00:43:27.581]  The Attorney General, along with the President, come out of the woodwork, they hold press conferences, so they are constantly feeding that anger that's within the hearts and minds of black people so that they can use them.
[00:43:28.082 --> 00:43:29.823]  You cannot control
[00:43:30.824 --> 00:43:35.846]  Immoral people, you have to demoralize them in order to control them.
[00:43:36.306 --> 00:43:47.329]  So they keep most, not all, not all, not all, but most black Americans in a state of anger and demoralization in order to control them, generation after generation.
[00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:52.851]  They will not allow you to resolve the issues in the public school system.
[00:43:53.311 --> 00:43:56.132]  They won't let you educate your kids at home.
[00:43:56.192 --> 00:43:58.173]  They try everything they can do to stop that.
[00:43:58.833 --> 00:44:11.057]  They won't let you speak the truth in churches nowadays, because they know if black Americans ever woke up and took control of their own lives, then the hustlers would go out of business.
[00:44:11.677 --> 00:44:17.059]  Such great points there, psychologically and societally considered as well.
[00:44:17.459 --> 00:44:26.582]  And you know, I think that part of what you're talking about here, at least for me, is what's really going on when they try to demonize white people or try to foment these race wars,
[00:44:27.242 --> 00:44:29.923]  They're really targeting black people is what they're doing.
[00:44:29.963 --> 00:44:48.332]  They're really trying to target the black people in order to, as you said, you know, try to leverage whatever hate or whatever anger that they have in their hearts, whether it be a family issue, an issue at school or whatever it is, they try to take that and then they try to levy that against the white man or against whoever it is that they aim it at.
[00:44:48.372 --> 00:44:50.893]  The police is another example here.
[00:44:51.273 --> 00:44:55.535]  But to me, it feels like these people, they don't even understand that there's still
[00:44:56.624 --> 00:45:01.827]  The black people are actually the victim of this brainwashing because, like you said, they're using the anger.
[00:45:01.867 --> 00:45:03.308]  They're using the false narratives.
[00:45:03.848 --> 00:45:04.368]  That's right.
[00:45:04.708 --> 00:45:05.969]  Look at Chicago.
[00:45:06.209 --> 00:45:09.131]  Black-on-black crime out, I mean, through the roof.
[00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:16.855]  And over this past year, something like 762 homicides, I believe, somewhere in there.
[00:45:16.875 --> 00:45:18.115]  I don't have the numbers in front of me.
[00:45:18.616 --> 00:45:20.897]  Obama has been in the White House for eight years.
[00:45:21.017 --> 00:45:22.678]  He has done nothing about that.
[00:45:23.238 --> 00:45:25.179]  And it's right in his backyard.
[00:45:25.339 --> 00:45:25.539]  Right.
[00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:30.542]  But nothing about it, and whenever he does mention it, it's all about racism.
[00:45:30.942 --> 00:45:32.363]  This is racism.
[00:45:32.403 --> 00:45:33.223]  This is racism.
[00:45:33.643 --> 00:45:47.710]  Obama could have gone in there, cleaned up this mess, or that mess, and then insisted that black men and women get married, or at least raise their children, be responsible, cut out the government programs,
[00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:49.712]  And rebuild that area.
[00:45:50.073 --> 00:46:04.691]  But he did nothing and he doesn't want to do anything because he needs the chaos, he needs the hatred between the races in order to redistribute wealth, power and wealth, in order to gain control for himself.
[00:46:05.211 --> 00:46:12.117]  Black leadership, liberal media, and white liberal Democrats can care less about Black people.
[00:46:12.557 --> 00:46:16.240]  Black folks are just a waste to a means.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:17.661]  They're just a vote.
[00:46:18.001 --> 00:46:21.284]  They're just there to be used for power and wealth.
[00:46:21.844 --> 00:46:33.393]  In this situation in Chicago, even the black police commissioner there in Chicago did not want to call it a hate crime.
[00:46:33.453 --> 00:46:35.955]  He tried to get around calling it a hate crime.
[00:46:36.376 --> 00:46:38.598]  I guarantee you, had it been for white
[00:46:39.412 --> 00:46:47.021]  Four white people doing that to a black person?
[00:46:47.481 --> 00:46:54.929]  The police commissioner would have called it a hate crime right off the bat, but he did not want to do it this time around.
[00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:56.051]  He was forced to do it.
[00:47:03.027 --> 00:47:11.173]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.153 --> 00:47:20.959]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.282 --> 00:47:28.324]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:48:59.628 --> 00:49:02.290]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:05.745 --> 00:49:13.516]  Well, from the economy to race relations, President Obama largely failed to deliver on his campaign promises of hope and change.
[00:49:13.576 --> 00:49:19.345]  Now we're just two weeks out from the end of President Obama, and what will his legacy be?
[00:49:19.425 --> 00:49:20.606]  Margaret Howell joins me now.
[00:49:21.127 --> 00:49:23.629]  You know, we can give it to him a little bit on the economy.
[00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:30.495]  Give him some leeway there because, of course, he inherited a financial crisis that, you know, we've been trying to dig our way out from.
[00:49:30.955 --> 00:49:36.059]  But there's a lot of this kind of back padding going on right now under these false pretenses.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.903]  You know, how many people are out outside of the job market?
[00:49:40.963 --> 00:49:44.646]  Of course, people who have stopped looking for a job are no longer counted as unemployed.
[00:49:45.167 --> 00:49:48.410]  So, you know, we don't even know what these official numbers are.
[00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:49.831]  But let's start with the economy.
[00:49:50.151 --> 00:49:54.833]  So we saw him skew the inflation rate and the job reports rate.
[00:49:54.873 --> 00:49:56.473]  We've seen him do this for the past six years.
[00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:57.614]  I've been covering this a lot.
[00:49:57.874 --> 00:49:58.474]  Here's what we know.
[00:49:58.534 --> 00:50:08.137]  So, CNS News, they're reporting that a record 95 million people, 95,102,000 specifically, are not in the labor force.
[00:50:08.177 --> 00:50:09.338]  Of course, I'm talking about U.S.
[00:50:09.358 --> 00:50:09.938]  citizens here.
[00:50:10.638 --> 00:50:15.240]  And the jobs that he did create, Leanne, so he wants to be known as the jobs president.
[00:50:15.641 --> 00:50:20.703]  You know, he botched over 300,000 manufacturing jobs in eight years as president.
[00:50:21.043 --> 00:50:22.184]  Here's the jobs that he added.
[00:50:22.224 --> 00:50:26.306]  Janitors, bartenders, nurses, waitresses.
[00:50:26.326 --> 00:50:28.007]  24,000 of the jobs report added.
[00:50:28.027 --> 00:50:29.628]  There were 156,000 in total.
[00:50:30.828 --> 00:50:32.429]  24,000 of them were in the food service industry.
[00:50:32.469 --> 00:50:34.250]  I'm not knocking these jobs because these are
[00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:35.711]  I don't know.
[00:50:52.722 --> 00:50:55.963]  I really, I mean honestly, this is a very skewed report.
[00:50:56.363 --> 00:50:58.564]  And this is something that Kit Daniels wrote, it's up on our website.
[00:50:59.024 --> 00:51:02.245]  So we really shouldn't count this as a part of his economic recovery.
[00:51:03.045 --> 00:51:07.466]  And this shouldn't be a part of his legacy because we've lost the manufacturing jobs.
[00:51:07.486 --> 00:51:08.546]  What have we gained?
[00:51:08.606 --> 00:51:10.247]  Food service industry jobs.
[00:51:10.307 --> 00:51:10.487]  Right.
[00:51:10.947 --> 00:51:20.391]  That's what a lot of people were very concerned that most of the jobs that were created were part-time jobs, and they were also those undesirable jobs that allegedly U.S.
[00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:25.333]  workers don't want, so that's why they're having to bring in a bunch of undocumented immigrants to take these jobs.
[00:51:25.433 --> 00:51:29.955]  Those were the jobs that were created, were the jobs that, you know, supposedly people do not want.
[00:51:30.695 --> 00:51:35.597]  So it's kind of glaring in the failure there, but we're also going to be having to kind of see
[00:51:36.477 --> 00:51:38.758]  The repercussions of the raising of the minimum wage.
[00:51:38.798 --> 00:51:42.279]  Now, I know a lot of people are very excited about this and think it's going to be so great.
[00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:47.881]  $15 an hour, which is a record minimum wage there in California, New York, other places.
[00:51:48.421 --> 00:51:58.725]  But of course, this means that the private sector is going to be responsible for finding the means to actually pay for the increase in wages, which means they're going to have to raise the prices on their products.
[00:51:59.705 --> 00:52:02.746]  Some people might, you know, have to lay off workers.
[00:52:02.846 --> 00:52:03.106]  Right.
[00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:04.787]  They won't be able to pay those wages.
[00:52:04.927 --> 00:52:09.332]  We're seeing companies that are switching to robotics or eliminating positions altogether.
[00:52:09.713 --> 00:52:13.597]  Small business owners are the brunt of the employers in this country.
[00:52:13.717 --> 00:52:15.739]  The number used to be 84% roughly.
[00:52:15.779 --> 00:52:18.803]  They're the ones that actually employ people, the everyday people.
[00:52:18.983 --> 00:52:23.208]  And what we see happen when the minimum wage goes up like this, they cut their workforce.
[00:52:23.228 --> 00:52:24.889]  And I come from a small business owner myself.
[00:52:25.831 --> 00:52:29.515]  She recently cut her workforce because of issues like this and with Obamacare.
[00:52:29.535 --> 00:52:33.499]  So it's a great thing in theory and oh isn't that wonderful?
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.523]  But you put this article up and I really want to touch on this and segue to it.
[00:52:37.984 --> 00:52:43.090]  We're talking about people entering the workforce, many of them millennials, and they feel very entitled, you know.
[00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:51.177]  I don't know about you, my first job, I was actually a babysitter and I think I made $2.75 an hour and I was really happy to get it.
[00:52:51.197 --> 00:52:55.600]  You know, you kind of have to look at the mindset of people entering the workforce.
[00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:58.383]  They're entitled, they're narcissistic, they're lazy.
[00:52:58.403 --> 00:53:00.685]  They're the trophy generation.
[00:53:00.765 --> 00:53:02.106]  I mean, everybody wins!
[00:53:02.506 --> 00:53:03.287]  Everyone's a winner!
[00:53:03.867 --> 00:53:04.628]  We're all the same.
[00:53:04.668 --> 00:53:05.550]  We're all equal.
[00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:10.516]  And it's not about, you know, the quality of your work and if you've actually earned the position to be there.
[00:53:10.556 --> 00:53:12.358]  Yes, we're having to deal with that as well.
[00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:12.679]  Right.
[00:53:12.779 --> 00:53:14.041]  And we're seeing this with Obamacare.
[00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:18.867]  You know, people, people work and say they put money into flex spending accounts to be able to afford health care.
[00:53:19.307 --> 00:53:20.249]  And this blanket
[00:53:20.709 --> 00:53:22.670]  You deserve the best health care out there.
[00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:23.810]  You have access to it.
[00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:24.910]  It's your human right.
[00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.211]  Well, that's not necessarily a human right.
[00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:31.572]  You know, the quality of care that you're provided is the quality of care that you pay for.
[00:53:31.612 --> 00:53:39.275]  And what we're seeing, we have a system that's totally bankrupt because people are taking from a system and they're not contributing back to it.
[00:53:39.335 --> 00:53:40.375]  We're carrying the brunt of it.
[00:53:40.795 --> 00:53:42.095]  And health care costs are soaring.
[00:53:42.115 --> 00:53:46.337]  We're going to see the same thing happen in the business sector because of the minimum wage increase.
[00:53:46.357 --> 00:53:46.737]  And you know what?
[00:53:47.017 --> 00:53:49.918]  Bernie Sanders, he had a lot of supporters because of this minimum wage increase.
[00:53:49.938 --> 00:53:50.298]  That was his
[00:53:50.478 --> 00:53:50.738]  Yeah.
[00:54:21.099 --> 00:54:28.144]  I mean with no shame that they actually don't pay their workers enough so that way they won't get knocked off the ability to collect welfare.
[00:54:28.485 --> 00:54:37.192]  So they're not only not paying their fair share of taxes there as a big giant corporation but they're also purposely paying their employees a rate that's gonna force them to be on
[00:54:37.472 --> 00:54:37.893]  I think so.
[00:54:53.536 --> 00:54:54.036]  I think so.
[00:55:10.209 --> 00:55:10.409]  Yeah.
[00:55:28.157 --> 00:55:36.345]  You know, their cause has been even more solidified, being behind bars in a military prison for years, and we're just going to turn them loose now.
[00:55:36.486 --> 00:55:44.594]  And drop them back into the communities where they're going to be hailed as heroes, or where people are going to be looking to them to retaliate.
[00:55:45.295 --> 00:55:46.796]  I don't understand the fast track thing.
[00:55:46.916 --> 00:55:49.839]  It's not that I agree with what's happening in Guantanamo Bay.
[00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:52.342]  A little bit insane.
[00:55:52.602 --> 00:55:52.842]  Right.
[00:55:52.922 --> 00:55:56.986]  It's a little bit insane what's happening and also just the fast-tracking of it because this is what he wants.
[00:55:57.327 --> 00:55:59.649]  He did make that promise he would shut down Guantanamo Bay.
[00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:00.350]  That didn't happen.
[00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:06.036]  So he is gonna at least just ram, you know, ram through as many of these potential jihadis as possible.
[00:56:06.756 --> 00:56:12.222]  Of course, we're also seeing this race relations and the civil unrest within our country.
[00:56:12.843 --> 00:56:17.949]  Obama comes out saying that race relations have gotten better under his presidency.
[00:56:17.989 --> 00:56:22.934]  Of course, this is coming off the reports of that Chicago torture video.
[00:56:23.815 --> 00:56:24.155]  I don't know.
[00:56:40.004 --> 00:56:43.086]  This just gives you any indication of how how things are going in this country.
[00:56:43.106 --> 00:56:46.567]  There's a GOP congressman today took matters into his own hands.
[00:56:47.027 --> 00:56:50.929]  He ripped down this painting, this art that was on the wall.
[00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:57.072]  This is Representative Duncan Hunter and the art belonged to Lacey Clay, a Democrat out of Missouri.
[00:56:57.453 --> 00:57:03.996]  So this congressman, his office had allowed this piece to be displayed there at the U.S.
[00:57:04.696 --> 00:57:05.176]  Capital.
[00:57:05.276 --> 00:57:05.677]  That's right.
[00:57:05.777 --> 00:57:08.258]  It's art depicting cops as pigs.
[00:57:08.379 --> 00:57:08.659]  That's right.
[00:57:08.779 --> 00:57:16.964]  They have these contests, and if you walk through the halls of Congress, they allow sometimes students, sometimes art students, sometimes private citizens.
[00:57:17.325 --> 00:57:18.565]  They hold these art contests.
[00:57:18.625 --> 00:57:27.051]  In this particular picture, it had painted police officers with the faces of pigs, and they were brutalizing black people in this painting.
[00:57:27.912 --> 00:57:31.174]  Total gross distortion of law enforcement in this country.
[00:57:31.234 --> 00:57:32.915]  You talked about race relations getting better.
[00:57:33.295 --> 00:57:44.798]  What we're actually seeing is the media marginalizing, marginalizing people, painting people into corners, like, you know, fueling the flames of this fire of the race war that is ongoing in this country.
[00:57:44.818 --> 00:57:52.500]  And what happened this week, despicable, absolutely a hate crime, but it's indicative of the entire nation and the way things are right now.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:54.101]  I don't know what report is looking at.
[00:57:54.781 --> 00:57:55.121]  Better.
[00:57:55.262 --> 00:57:55.962]  I mean, really?
[00:57:55.982 --> 00:57:57.163]  He's not watching our show.
[00:57:57.303 --> 00:57:58.324]  Well, he's very delusional.
[00:57:58.345 --> 00:58:10.096]  And I think if, you know, in his way of, like, gotten better in the sense that now people are viciously kind of fighting back for what they see as injustice, they're now taking matters into their own hands.
[00:58:11.517 --> 00:58:16.901]  CNN actually attacked Paul Joseph Watson for linking the Chicago torture video to Black Lives Matter.
[00:58:16.941 --> 00:58:18.282]  They did a little hit piece on him.
[00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:30.811]  The Washington Post is worried that this videotaped torture is going to provide evidence of the anti-white racism and feed into that narrative, the pro-Trump narrative, that white people are facing rampant discrimination in America.
[00:58:30.851 --> 00:58:32.492]  And of course, it is on the rise.
[00:58:32.532 --> 00:58:39.777]  We actually have some other black supremacist videos being passed around on Twitter now where they're actively calling for more
[00:58:40.217 --> 00:58:41.118]  We're good to go.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.930]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:20.115]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.435 --> 00:59:24.176]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.737 --> 00:59:27.578]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.779 --> 00:59:36.003]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.323 --> 00:59:38.604]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
