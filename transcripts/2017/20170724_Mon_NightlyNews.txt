[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.602]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:23.266]  It's Monday, July 24th, 2017.
[00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:24.507]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:25.769]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:28.874 --> 00:00:32.455]  Tonight, breaking news from the Infowar.
[00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:39.518]  A senior Republican congressman says there is a plan to take out President Donald Trump.
[00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:46.881]  And now, even the iconic conservative media heads agree this isn't some crazy conspiracy theory.
[00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.322]  The plot to overthrow Trump is evident.
[00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:59.944]  This is about a full-on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump.
[00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:02.445]  Then, we have the documents.
[00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:08.186]  The plot to replace Europeans with migrants and refugees is exposed.
[00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:14.527]  All that plus President Trump tells the establishment Republicans that the time to act is now.
[00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:20.594]  Fulfill your promise to the American people and end the Obamacare nightmare.
[00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.537]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:35.358]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:47.404]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact
[00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:53.667]  That our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:02.310]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:11.815]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:18.804]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:27.317]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.041]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.904]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:43.532]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:49.661]  Because of you praying for the broadcast, because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:49.922 --> 00:02:55.591]  So please, secure your caveman today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:04.104 --> 00:03:10.586]  All right, so here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office.
[00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:11.506]  It's that serious.
[00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:13.207]  This is not a diversionary tactic.
[00:03:13.247 --> 00:03:14.207]  This stuff is real here.
[00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:17.728]  This coup, this silent coup that is taking place is real.
[00:03:18.068 --> 00:03:29.592]  A soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[00:03:30.152 --> 00:03:36.320]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.048]  I got to go into the Congress and spend three hours from 9.30 in the evening to 12.30 a.m.
[00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.392]  with one of the senior ranking members of Congress.
[00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:52.500]  And he told me, and of course this is what I said on CBN but they cut it out, but I'm going to go public with this because we have to.
[00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:57.148]  He said, there is a plot on Capitol Hill to take the President out.
[00:03:57.228 --> 00:03:59.671]  I said, you mean by impeachment or by indictment?
[00:03:59.691 --> 00:04:01.154]  He said, no, to take him out.
[00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:06.358]  This is an effort to subvert the administration of President Donald Trump.
[00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:07.899]  It is nothing less.
[00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:17.626]  It is an effort by the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and a legitimate government and to break the will of the American people.
[00:04:17.946 --> 00:04:19.247]  You can read between the lines.
[00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:21.548]  I said, look, I said, that's not going to happen.
[00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.591]  He said, he said, well, really, there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:28.834]  I said, we are going to stop it because we're going to mobilize the body of Christ
[00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:35.219]  And the best description of it is by Barry Kesselman in his blog where he said this is a coup d'etat.
[00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.722]  He said 14 million citizens in private ballots picked Donald Trump.
[00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:42.565]  20 TV executives have decided to destroy him.
[00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:48.049]  This is no longer about Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.
[00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:58.958]  This is about a full-on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump.
[00:04:59.784 --> 00:05:13.759]  There is a deep state coup, there is an establishment coup, the same deep state, the same establishment that has tried to take down our republic and now they are trying to take down President Trump and take down the American people that elected him.
[00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.641]  And there's two stories here, not just the coup,
[00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:22.067]  That you now see everybody telling you is going on against President Trump in the deep state.
[00:05:22.508 --> 00:05:28.033]  But how about the mainstream conservative media now willing to call that out?
[00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:35.982]  How huge is that to have mainstream people like Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Lou Dobbs, the list goes on,
[00:05:36.522 --> 00:05:43.368]  Putting this into the mainstream, putting this narrative out there, forcing the American public to know what is going on.
[00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:50.454]  They can't say they're ignorant, they have to know about the Deep State coup, and if they choose to ignore it, well then the onus is on them.
[00:05:50.554 --> 00:05:52.876]  So, two really big stories breaking there.
[00:05:53.336 --> 00:06:00.182]  It's good to see that more mainline conservatives are going towards red-pilling their audience, if you will.
[00:06:00.642 --> 00:06:02.284]  But the coup doesn't stop there.
[00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:04.566]  It continues on to Hollywood.
[00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:09.777]  And we know what they like to do in Hollywood with their satanic rituals.
[00:06:10.297 --> 00:06:12.858]  One famous for that would be Lena Del Rey now.
[00:06:13.658 --> 00:06:21.421]  So, Lena Del Rey is now, Lana Del Rey is now confirming, I don't know who this woman is, my crew correcting me here.
[00:06:21.961 --> 00:06:26.762]  Lana, Lena, who cares, Del Rey is using witchcraft against Donald Trump.
[00:06:26.782 --> 00:06:34.965]  So now all the little tweeners and teeny boppers and pop-tarts that look up to Lena Del Rey, she's so great, she's my idol.
[00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:36.405]  Well, she's a witch.
[00:06:37.325 --> 00:06:38.926]  Don't ask me, ask her.
[00:06:39.246 --> 00:06:41.626]  She's performing witchcraft against Donald Trump.
[00:06:41.926 --> 00:06:43.127]  But this is not new.
[00:06:43.967 --> 00:06:49.208]  So you got Lana Del Rey having midnight hexes to put on Donald Trump.
[00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:51.268]  They're doing this all across America.
[00:06:51.288 --> 00:06:53.529]  I mean, I couldn't believe this.
[00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:54.609]  I found all sorts.
[00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.449]  This is one from back in April in San Diego.
[00:06:57.609 --> 00:06:59.930]  Witches gather to hex President Trump.
[00:07:01.513 --> 00:07:02.253]  Here's another one.
[00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:06.675]  Witches gather at Balboa Park to hex President Trump.
[00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:08.476]  This is again from April.
[00:07:08.556 --> 00:07:09.596]  That's in California.
[00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:14.278]  Witches unite to cast Binding Spell on Trump and followers.
[00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:16.039]  That's back from February.
[00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:18.620]  Witches in Chicago.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.921]  This one's from February.
[00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:23.702]  Witches in Chicago casting a hex on President Trump.
[00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:25.403]  You can see some of the B-roll now.
[00:07:26.223 --> 00:07:27.464]  So what is that?
[00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:33.814]  What are witches from Hollywood casting hex on President Trump?
[00:07:33.994 --> 00:07:34.735]  What is that?
[00:07:35.075 --> 00:07:38.138]  That's part of the same deep state establishment coup, folks.
[00:07:39.018 --> 00:07:43.642]  The same corruption that has infiltrated politics has infiltrated Hollywood.
[00:07:45.523 --> 00:07:47.545]  They all like Satan, folks.
[00:07:48.045 --> 00:07:49.686]  They're all putting a hex on Trump.
[00:07:50.647 --> 00:07:54.190]  Oh, and just a little side note here before we go on with the hex being put on Trump.
[00:07:55.253 --> 00:07:56.634]  People look up to Hollywood.
[00:07:56.774 --> 00:07:58.055]  They idolize these people.
[00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:00.976]  Justin Bieber just cancelled his remaining tour.
[00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:01.517]  You know why?
[00:08:01.537 --> 00:08:02.517]  Because he's over it.
[00:08:04.198 --> 00:08:05.999]  Hollywood hates you.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.981]  Justin Bieber hates you.
[00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:12.683]  You think Bieber cares about the people he just cancelled his tour because he's over it?
[00:08:12.983 --> 00:08:15.024]  You think Lana Del Rey cares about America?
[00:08:15.304 --> 00:08:16.045]  Cares about you?
[00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:17.706]  She's having witch hexes?
[00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:19.807]  These people don't care about you?
[00:08:22.182 --> 00:08:24.106]  So why should you listen to them?
[00:08:24.226 --> 00:08:27.312]  Why should you idolize these false idols?
[00:08:28.013 --> 00:08:28.514]  You shouldn't.
[00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.037]  You shouldn't.
[00:08:30.598 --> 00:08:35.026]  So not only you got Hollywood and their witchy hexes on President Trump,
[00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:41.630]  How about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who's been very outspoken, criticizing Trump.
[00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:53.993]  You know, there used to be a nice tradition, sportsmanship if you would, of Supreme Court Justices avoiding commenting on politics and the President, but Ginsburg, she had to end that common courtesy.
[00:08:54.373 --> 00:08:59.895]  And she's been complaining now, she's been complaining, but now she's complaining about how polarized politics are.
[00:09:00.295 --> 00:09:04.656]  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she's optimistic about the future of the U.S.
[00:09:04.736 --> 00:09:05.596]  over the long term.
[00:09:06.016 --> 00:09:09.018]  Not in the near term, you can't support President Trump, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:12.981]  She hopes politics can become less polarized in her lifetime.
[00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:15.102]  Oh, but it was Obama that polarized them.
[00:09:15.743 --> 00:09:23.068]  And then she says this, when the pendulum of US politics swings too far in one direction, you can look forward to it moving back.
[00:09:23.668 --> 00:09:26.850]  She is referencing that as President Trump swinging the pendulum.
[00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:28.411]  No, sweetheart.
[00:09:29.508 --> 00:09:30.828]  That's what Obama did.
[00:09:30.968 --> 00:09:32.529]  That's what we're witnessing now.
[00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:35.450]  President Trump is Obama's legacy.
[00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.551]  The reaction to the cancer that was Obama is President Trump.
[00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:42.652]  This is the pendulum swinging back.
[00:09:43.692 --> 00:09:46.373]  It was Obama swinging this way, hate America.
[00:09:46.733 --> 00:09:49.974]  Now it's Trump singing, celebrating the 4th of July.
[00:09:50.274 --> 00:09:50.874]  Now it's Trump
[00:09:51.534 --> 00:09:54.936]  Love America, hug your flag, kiss the flag, so a big difference.
[00:09:54.976 --> 00:10:01.821]  But Ruth Bader Ginsburg now trying to hex Donald Trump by pretending it's he that is polarizing America.
[00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:06.344]  But it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg that spreads this hateful rhetoric of the left.
[00:10:06.824 --> 00:10:12.488]  The hateful rhetoric of the left that got Steve Scalise shot, could have had multiple Republicans assassinated.
[00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:17.512]  The hateful rhetoric of the left that has people rioting in the streets could cause a civil war.
[00:10:19.155 --> 00:10:21.335]  But now, and this is also what it does.
[00:10:21.856 --> 00:10:27.016]  It has just average people on the streets out there hating the American flag, hating veterans.
[00:10:27.557 --> 00:10:30.937]  Here's a 92-year-old war veteran, Howard Banks.
[00:10:31.577 --> 00:10:40.479]  Now, this is a man who's been blinded from fighting in World War II, obviously an elder gentleman, but he has a Marine flag and an American flag flying at his house.
[00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:45.220]  Well, about a year ago, he had his flags torn up and shredded and thrown into a ditch.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.588]  So ever since then, he's been very keen to his porch and aware of his flags.
[00:10:50.928 --> 00:10:52.390]  Well, it happened again the other night.
[00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.453]  Someone was trying to tamper with his flags.
[00:10:54.774 --> 00:10:57.798]  He went out there to protect them, and then he got attacked!
[00:10:58.683 --> 00:11:06.850]  This is a 92-year-old man, a war veteran that gets attacked by American citizens, the scum of the earth, instigated by the left.
[00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:09.152]  But how about this tough old man?
[00:11:09.213 --> 00:11:13.596]  He's still willing to make a very fair statement and not a hateful statement.
[00:11:13.617 --> 00:11:22.324]  He says, we've honored our flag all the time and doggone it, with our political climate the way it is, we need something to rally around and that is our flag.
[00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:24.887]  Wow, sounds like something that Donald Trump says too.
[00:11:25.447 --> 00:11:28.089]  You know, first you start with messing with the American flag.
[00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:29.850]  I really love this one from the veteran.
[00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.093]  You start messing with the American flag, I get real hot under the collar.
[00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:40.097]  And then, when I found out they yanked the Marine Corps flag down, that made my bottom spicy.
[00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:43.746]  I'd hate to have his bottom spicy around me.
[00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:45.868]  We need to respect our flag.
[00:11:46.028 --> 00:11:47.429]  That is the symbol of our country.
[00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:55.433]  It is a symbol of what we stand for as a beacon of hope for liberty in this world, and if you can't respect that, then we don't really want you here.
[00:11:55.753 --> 00:11:56.214]  And that's the thing.
[00:11:56.234 --> 00:12:06.180]  This 92-year-old veteran, when he gets spicy, he's more of a threat than these little leftist little ninnies running around that haven't even lifted a weight in their life.
[00:12:07.153 --> 00:12:09.095]  So I just found it despicable.
[00:12:09.235 --> 00:12:10.756]  That's what the left does though.
[00:12:10.776 --> 00:12:12.678]  They attack the weak.
[00:12:12.838 --> 00:12:14.400]  They try to victimize the weak.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:20.926]  They attack an old person just because he has an American flag and a Marine Corps flag flying on his front porch.
[00:12:20.946 --> 00:12:24.429]  I mean, how dare the war veteran have an American flag?
[00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:28.273]  That is offensive to those liberals that walked by and wanted to attack a 92-year-old man.
[00:12:30.128 --> 00:12:31.130]  But you know what's amazing?
[00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.994]  The scum of the earth will always be the scum of the earth.
[00:12:33.415 --> 00:12:38.966]  But the main middle of the road Americans out there are starting to wake up to what's going on.
[00:12:39.668 --> 00:12:41.011]  And President Trump is
[00:12:42.108 --> 00:12:57.753]  We're beating the two-party system, especially with the Obamacare vote, where you have Republicans that are saying, for seven years, we're going to repeal Obamacare, we're going to replace Obamacare, and then the day comes where they can finally deliver on that promise, and what do they do?
[00:12:58.213 --> 00:13:00.193]  They do not deliver.
[00:13:00.914 --> 00:13:08.056]  And so, right now, this is from the Washington Compost, Republicans are in full control of government, but losing control of their party.
[00:13:09.437 --> 00:13:12.300]  No, that's not exactly accurate.
[00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:15.304]  Now, Republicans are in control of government.
[00:13:15.324 --> 00:13:16.665]  They are in control of Congress.
[00:13:16.705 --> 00:13:25.435]  They should be able to impose their will upon whatever legislation that they want, especially considering the President is Republican as well.
[00:13:25.795 --> 00:13:30.360]  But that's not happening because the truth of the matter is it's a one-party system.
[00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:32.502]  That's the truth of the matter.
[00:13:32.902 --> 00:13:34.503]  That's what America is seeing now.
[00:13:34.864 --> 00:13:43.950]  That's what Trump is putting in the light, that the Republicans and the Democrats have been working together, colluding with the media.
[00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.651]  It's always been that way.
[00:13:46.011 --> 00:13:48.593]  And Trump is showing that in full force.
[00:13:48.653 --> 00:13:52.376]  So I wouldn't say Republicans are losing control of their party.
[00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:58.240]  I would say that the Republican Party is where people are going right now, behind President Trump.
[00:13:59.522 --> 00:14:01.345]  And they're not going to deal with swamp members.
[00:14:01.845 --> 00:14:04.669]  They're not going to deal with those that didn't want to repeal.
[00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:08.614]  They're not going to deal with those that don't want to get behind President Trump's agenda.
[00:14:08.794 --> 00:14:11.718]  They're not going to deal with those that don't deliver on tax reform.
[00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:13.901]  They're no longer going to deal with these people!
[00:14:14.767 --> 00:14:25.297]  So it's not that Republicans are losing control of their party, it's that the people are taking the Republican Party as their ship to steer America in the right direction.
[00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:30.882]  As the ship, we're going to get on this Republican ship, this is the ship we're going to take America back with.
[00:14:31.283 --> 00:14:32.284]  That's what's been decided.
[00:14:32.324 --> 00:14:37.368]  There was a glimpse of hopes in the Republican Party with people like Rand Paul, Ron Paul, etc, etc.
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.782]  But President Trump became the captain of the ship and that's why we're getting on this ship.
[00:14:42.842 --> 00:14:44.863]  And the Democrats are the most corrupt party on earth, folks.
[00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:45.843]  I mean, this is undeniable.
[00:14:46.123 --> 00:14:48.144]  Led by Hillary Clinton and the Barack Obamas of the world.
[00:14:48.725 --> 00:14:59.109]  So, the Republicans, the deep state, the fake Republicans are losing control because they're not going to be in office much longer and the people can see through their veil.
[00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.050]  Now, how about this?
[00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.071]  This really tells you a story here, folks.
[00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:06.713]  Adam Schiff, little pencil neck, Schifty Schiff,
[00:15:07.924 --> 00:15:13.509]  Adam Schiff has done 14 hours of television interviews since Trump took office.
[00:15:14.489 --> 00:15:23.377]  Democrat Adam Schiff has done 123 national television interviews totaling more than 14 hours of airtime since January.
[00:15:25.661 --> 00:15:34.207]  All Adam Schiff does is go on the hill and cry about Trump, and then go on TV and cry about Trump.
[00:15:34.627 --> 00:15:36.408]  And you better watch out, Shifty Schiff.
[00:15:36.808 --> 00:15:40.491]  I think there might be something coming out with you and Russian collusion.
[00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:51.918]  So Shifty Schiff, one of the most worthless people on the hill up there with Maxine Waters, does nothing except go to the hill and cry about Trump, then go on TV and cry about Trump.
[00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:58.279]  Now, Trump has been working hard to bring awareness to America about the failed bill of Obamacare.
[00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:00.280]  He's been meeting with people affected by it.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.581]  He's been putting it on TV, shedding the light on it, so he knows what he's talking about.
[00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:07.141]  Today, he gave a speech addressing healthcare.
[00:16:07.441 --> 00:16:13.162]  He brought more people, he brought more facts, and he told the Republicans, what are you doing about Obamacare?
[00:16:13.322 --> 00:16:14.363]  Why didn't you come through?
[00:16:14.623 --> 00:16:16.383]  Here's a highlight from President Trump's speech.
[00:16:17.264 --> 00:16:33.993]  The Washington politicians who made those promises to Steve, Marjorie, Melissa, Aaron, and their beautiful children want to ignore all the pain, all the suffering, and all of the money, the tremendous amounts of money that these lies have caused.
[00:16:34.553 --> 00:16:45.339]  They want to forget about the countless Americans they've hurt and the many that they are continuing to hurt every day by refusing to help us replace Obamacare.
[00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:52.824]  For the last seven years, Republicans have been united in standing up for Obamacare's victims.
[00:16:53.024 --> 00:16:53.564]  Remember?
[00:16:53.724 --> 00:16:55.105]  Repeal and replace.
[00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:56.586]  Repeal and replace.
[00:16:57.067 --> 00:16:59.648]  They kept saying it over and over again.
[00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:06.133]  Every Republican running for office promised immediate relief from this disastrous law.
[00:17:06.753 --> 00:17:17.604]  We as a party must fulfill that solemn promise to the voters of this country to repeal and replace what they've been saying for the last seven years.
[00:17:18.304 --> 00:17:23.509]  But so far, Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare.
[00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:33.618]  They now have a chance, however, to hopefully, hopefully fix what has been so badly broken for such a long time.
[00:17:34.298 --> 00:17:40.183]  And that is through replacement of a horrible disaster known as Obamacare.
[00:17:40.823 --> 00:17:45.007]  The Senate is very close to the votes it needs to pass a replacement.
[00:17:45.782 --> 00:17:49.825]  The problem is we have zero help from the Democrats.
[00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:51.466]  They're obstructionists.
[00:17:51.486 --> 00:17:52.287]  That's all they are.
[00:17:52.427 --> 00:17:54.288]  That's all they're good at is obstruction.
[00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:56.170]  Making things not work.
[00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.554]  They say all the right things and then they do exactly what they're not supposed to be doing.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:09.044]  The Democrats aren't giving us one vote, so we need virtually every single vote from the Republicans.
[00:18:09.124 --> 00:18:10.024]  Not easy to do.
[00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:30.515]  The Senate bill that is being considered outside of the outright repeal of Obamacare will also provide emergency relief for the law's victims, and it will deliver truly great health care and health care reforms that our citizens want, need, and really should be demanding.
[00:18:30.715 --> 00:18:31.676]  Some are demanding.
[00:18:32.415 --> 00:18:34.837]  You'll see that at the voter booth.
[00:18:35.077 --> 00:18:35.517]  Believe me.
[00:18:35.798 --> 00:18:38.340]  That is the President Trump that we love.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.142]  That is the President Trump that we need to hear more of.
[00:18:41.402 --> 00:18:45.345]  And the truth of the matter is, folks, in this country, you could get healthcare.
[00:18:45.585 --> 00:18:47.226]  You could get healthcare in this country.
[00:18:47.306 --> 00:18:48.207]  That wasn't the problem.
[00:18:48.467 --> 00:18:51.750]  It was that the insurance companies couldn't get you to pay for it.
[00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.192]  It's health coverage that they're forcing you to pay.
[00:18:54.392 --> 00:18:57.194]  That's government going into your pocket and giving to the rich.
[00:18:57.354 --> 00:18:58.475]  That's what Bernie Sanders is against.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:10.484 --> 00:23:25.218]  While much ado about a big Russian nothing burger floods American media six months plus into President Trump's hijacked agenda, those truly shifting the pieces on the New World Order chessboard continue to be ignored.
[00:23:25.518 --> 00:23:32.344]  One of them, Turkey's President Erdogan, has unleashed a reign of terror that is largely cloaked by the media.
[00:23:32.504 --> 00:23:36.268]  The left and the so-called humanitarian global community
[00:23:36.608 --> 00:23:42.375]  As the cries of impeachment of our own president continue here in the United States of America.
[00:23:42.516 --> 00:23:48.823]  Erdogan's purge decimating Turkey's once booming economy and secular culture is staggering.
[00:23:48.944 --> 00:23:52.068]  Turkeypurge.com reports a total of 965 companies
[00:23:54.130 --> 00:24:14.842]  With a total value of $11.32 billion in assets have either been transferred to Turkey's state-run Savings Deposit Insurance Fund, or trustees have been appointed to their management by the government since a failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016, Deputy Prime Minister Nurettin Kenikli said.
[00:24:14.942 --> 00:24:20.285]  Meanwhile, trustees were appointed also to administer personal properties of 107 individuals
[00:24:21.926 --> 00:24:34.358]  The total equity capital of the seized companies is $18.2 billion, while their combined turnover is $21.9 billion, according to the TMSF report.
[00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:43.127]  I strongly condemn the German Communist's baseless comments aimed at starting and disturbing companies investing in our country with indirect messages.
[00:24:44.028 --> 00:24:45.850]  There is no freedom here, first of all.
[00:25:01.349 --> 00:25:01.570]  I think?
[00:25:16.067 --> 00:25:24.109]  We are not allowed to take in any debate in any government state-run TV or government-sponsored TV.
[00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.611]  Turkey now is so much in a dark, dark days really.
[00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:39.034]  Under such circumstances, we are trying to demonstrate our democratic force to rescue democracy from the dictatorship.
[00:25:39.074 --> 00:25:41.455]  So it's an extraordinary situation in Turkey.
[00:25:41.835 --> 00:25:43.595]  One will Demirtas
[00:25:48.093 --> 00:25:51.755]  HDP deputies will be released.
[00:25:52.396 --> 00:25:54.637]  Now, first of all, terrorists.
[00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:01.841]  We don't have the power, the authority to release terrorists from prisons.
[00:26:01.881 --> 00:26:04.302]  Turkey is a state of law.
[00:26:04.582 --> 00:26:06.824]  The person that you mentioned is a terrorist.
[00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:09.907]  Id Riza, a Turkish-born U.S.
[00:26:09.927 --> 00:26:14.870]  citizen and an ethnic Kurd, was among those wounded in the Tuesday melee.
[00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.993]  He told VOA that Erdogan's bodyguards threw him on the ground and kicked him in the head.
[00:26:20.394 --> 00:26:21.434]  I was knocked to the ground.
[00:26:21.454 --> 00:26:22.535]  They started kicking us.
[00:26:22.835 --> 00:26:24.196]  Three, four men were kicking us.
[00:26:25.217 --> 00:26:30.399]  Erdogan's bullying of American protesters by his bodyguards in the shadow of the D.C.
[00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:38.082]  Turkish Ambassador's home recently was met with the bleeding of sheep in Congress, merely asking for an apology.
[00:26:38.282 --> 00:26:39.082]  An apology?
[00:26:39.482 --> 00:26:39.782]  Really?
[00:26:40.022 --> 00:26:46.465]  How about speaking Erdogan's language and posting an eviction notice on the Turkish Ambassador's door?
[00:26:46.645 --> 00:26:49.666]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:26:54.275 --> 00:27:03.844]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:27:04.304 --> 00:27:06.066]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:27:06.226 --> 00:27:06.766]  Think about it.
[00:27:06.986 --> 00:27:12.772]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:27:13.012 --> 00:27:18.577]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:27:18.957 --> 00:27:30.723]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:33.765]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:27:33.945 --> 00:27:36.446]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:27:36.746 --> 00:27:41.208]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:27:41.629 --> 00:27:42.189]  Think about it.
[00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:53.607]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:28:02.523 --> 00:28:03.284]  Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:28:03.304 --> 00:28:05.545]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:28:05.826 --> 00:28:09.349]  Now, we have some news coming out of Iraq and Syria.
[00:28:09.749 --> 00:28:16.054]  Now, there's information coming in that Mosul has been liberated by Iraqi forces.
[00:28:16.234 --> 00:28:17.395]  ISIS has been kicked out.
[00:28:17.735 --> 00:28:24.921]  They've been holding that place pretty much hostage for the last year and a half or so, torturing people, shooting at them.
[00:28:24.981 --> 00:28:30.606]  As you can see, I'll show you some footage right now of families fleeing ISIS.
[00:28:31.536 --> 00:28:32.437]  Now, what is ISIS?
[00:28:32.637 --> 00:28:50.747]  ISIS is a group of radicalized Islamic extremists who uphold values of this Sharia law, which aren't even values, but to them they're a way of life, a value that people should live by, rules and guidelines to go by.
[00:28:51.367 --> 00:28:55.350]  And these people, as you can see right now, are fleeing that from happening.
[00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:05.354]  And then you have women and men in Syria who have escaped from ISIS strongholds celebrating by burning their burqas.
[00:29:05.574 --> 00:29:08.695]  The men are shaving their beards in spite of ISIS.
[00:29:08.775 --> 00:29:14.417]  Now, it is part of the culture over there to have a beard for a man, but they're so angry at ISIS.
[00:29:14.517 --> 00:29:21.179]  They're so pissed off because of the family members they've lost and the Sharia law that's been implemented that they're sick and tired of it.
[00:29:21.199 --> 00:29:22.600]  And they're just to say, enough is enough.
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:23.500]  Screw this.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.761]  We want no part of it.
[00:29:25.541 --> 00:29:34.288]  And yet you have people like Linda Sarsour who prance around over here in America, free to do whatever she wants, to make the decision to wear that burka.
[00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:36.550]  She's not forced to wear it here.
[00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:43.195]  But these women in Syria and in parts of ISIS strongholds throughout Iraq and other countries are forced to.
[00:29:43.996 --> 00:29:46.917]  Just like I have the ability to have a beard.
[00:29:46.997 --> 00:29:48.278]  I wasn't forced to have it.
[00:29:48.598 --> 00:29:50.979]  No one said, hey, you've got to have a beard when you get older, Joe.
[00:29:51.299 --> 00:29:52.520]  That's just how our culture is.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.561]  No, I had the opportunity.
[00:29:54.601 --> 00:30:04.826]  The only time I was told I couldn't have one is when I was in the Army, and that's just kind of part of the rules and regulations set forth by the military in that job.
[00:30:04.906 --> 00:30:05.846]  So you have to go with it.
[00:30:06.086 --> 00:30:08.207]  But now that I'm out, it's my decision.
[00:30:08.728 --> 00:30:13.130]  And Linda has the right in America to wear that.
[00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.733]  But she doesn't have the right to come here and say that, oh, she's for women's rights.
[00:30:18.113 --> 00:30:27.459]  When you clearly have these people fleeing from ISIS, running from a Azul, you have this woman right here that we're going to show a video of burning her burka, asking for a lighter.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.242]  She's sick and tired of being told that she has to wear this.
[00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:37.166]  She's sick and tired of being held at such a subhuman level without any rights whatsoever.
[00:30:37.606 --> 00:30:46.709]  And yet you have Linda Sarsour coming over here and preaching to people, calling for a jihad on Trump, saying that women need to rise up against bigotry and Islamophobia.
[00:30:47.109 --> 00:30:50.150]  It's not an irrational fear what these people are doing right now.
[00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.892]  They're not irrationally, you know, scared and that's why they're running away.
[00:30:54.232 --> 00:30:55.292]  That's a legitimate fear.
[00:30:55.472 --> 00:30:59.553]  ISIS is something to legitimately fear because they are beheading people.
[00:30:59.934 --> 00:31:00.714]  They are burying them.
[00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:03.855]  They're burning them alive, throwing them off cliffs, throwing them off bridges.
[00:31:04.975 --> 00:31:12.549]  Executing them, training their young children to grow up to become fighters and snipers and they've radicalized people within our country.
[00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:17.277]  They've radicalized people within Australia and England and all over the place in Paris.
[00:31:18.427 --> 00:31:23.989]  So it's out of control to sit here and go, oh, Islamophobia, because this is not an irrational fear.
[00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:33.793]  These women burning their burqas, this is the first time they've actually had the ability to liberate themselves, to actually have some empowerment.
[00:31:34.194 --> 00:31:42.197]  That's true feminism, when you see this woman taking off her burqa, asking for a lighter, and burning that sign or that symbol of oppression.
[00:31:42.737 --> 00:31:49.778]  Being forced to cover her body and not having the ability to make her own decisions as to how she would like to dress.
[00:31:50.479 --> 00:32:05.922]  So this is just completely and totally ridiculous when you see people like Linda Soursour coming over here and preaching all this crap and trying to radicalize people into falling for this stupid fake hoax that it's okay to wear a hijab, that it's empowering.
[00:32:05.982 --> 00:32:06.642]  No, it's not!
[00:32:07.222 --> 00:32:08.644]  These women are burning them.
[00:32:08.824 --> 00:32:13.249]  These other families are clearly running with people shooting at them.
[00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.233]  That is what radical Islamic terror is.
[00:32:17.593 --> 00:32:20.236]  That is what Sharia law is.
[00:32:20.557 --> 00:32:23.480]  And that is what they want to bring over here to America.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.043]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:32:26.468 --> 00:32:28.049]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:32:28.069 --> 00:32:29.750]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.470]  Okay?
[00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.631]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:32:33.812 --> 00:32:35.512]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:32:35.532 --> 00:32:36.873]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:32:37.193 --> 00:32:37.874]  This is Texas.
[00:32:38.114 --> 00:32:38.934]  You want to threaten me?
[00:32:38.994 --> 00:32:40.115]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:32:40.155 --> 00:32:40.775]  You understand that?
[00:32:40.935 --> 00:32:46.698]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:32:47.138 --> 00:32:50.960]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.

[00:33:18.236 --> 00:33:23.037]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.

[00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:41.242]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:33:41.502 --> 00:33:50.344]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:53.765]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.531]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:03.692 --> 00:34:06.112]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemister.
[00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:13.575]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:24.098]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:42.189]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:51.335 --> 00:34:52.476]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:53.796]  That means it's pure.
[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.847]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.867 --> 00:36:54.748]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:36:55.008 --> 00:37:01.310]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:18.335]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to talk to you today about the basic survival, not just of Western society, but of the family and the human community itself.
[00:37:19.534 --> 00:37:25.637]  The technocrats, as the world's ruling elite call themselves, are incredibly selfish people.
[00:37:26.478 --> 00:37:37.004]  And they admit that they have a plan to balkanize nations and turn peoples against each other so they can be easily ruled via divide and conquer.
[00:37:38.319 --> 00:37:55.145]  But first the nation state itself must be taken over by private corporate combines and foreign groups then need to be brought in who are clothed and fed and brainwashed by the state to be destabilization forces.
[00:37:55.845 --> 00:37:57.445]  Now this is not my opinion.
[00:37:58.246 --> 00:38:04.848]  On screen is an article from 2012 from the BBC that's promoting world government
[00:38:06.257 --> 00:38:06.517]  Yeah.
[00:38:26.664 --> 00:38:35.228]  Systems that will not quote upset the islamicist and others and examples of this are in Germany They tell women don't wear short skirts.
[00:38:35.549 --> 00:38:36.549]  It'll make the Muslims mad.
[00:38:36.569 --> 00:38:41.492]  They're starting to not have outdoor Oktoberfest because the Muslims will attack people drinking beer
[00:38:42.432 --> 00:38:55.523]  The Muslims are attacking people walking dogs, saying they're unclean, and now in schools in the U.S., but also in Europe and places in Austria, they're banning pork in school lunches because Muslims are upset about it.
[00:38:56.103 --> 00:39:01.788]  Well, Orthodox Jews don't eat pork, but they don't then demand that the schools don't serve it.
[00:39:03.012 --> 00:39:06.133]  This is all about total and complete control.
[00:39:06.213 --> 00:39:14.135]  They're bringing in groups like Orthodox radical Muslims who won't even get along with each other in their own countries and have constant civil war.
[00:39:14.895 --> 00:39:24.558]  They are so cult-like and they admit that they're going to make Europe, the United States, Australia adopt authoritarian codes to quote
[00:39:26.095 --> 00:39:27.156]  Accommodate the Muslims.
[00:39:27.336 --> 00:39:30.378]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is how we're being culturally conquered.
[00:39:30.698 --> 00:39:46.207]  First they get us to be open to the gays, and then, you know, to be open to this group or that group, and then next they're saying we're going to teach your children about how to have sex when they're five years old, and how to masturbate in schools, but we're going to bring in Muslims that throw gay people off buildings, and you're going to submit to them as well.
[00:39:46.247 --> 00:39:52.731]  But you're not going to give out Christmas cards, as we've seen cases around the country, at Christmas at school because of separation of church and state.
[00:39:53.632 --> 00:39:56.364]  Separation of church and state, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:57.603 --> 00:40:00.145]  says that the government can't have an official religion.
[00:40:00.365 --> 00:40:02.447]  It doesn't mean you can't hand out Christmas cards.
[00:40:02.947 --> 00:40:12.894]  But only Christians, Libertarians, Conservatives, Nationalists, free market folks, a very diverse group, only we have to give up our speech and shut up.
[00:40:13.355 --> 00:40:22.982]  Well here's a new article today that David Knight and Owen Shore are going to be breaking down a little bit later here on the live transmission from WorldNetDaily, simply pointing out a UN document from 2000
[00:40:24.463 --> 00:40:28.545]  Telling folks, oh we need to bring in the folks from Africa, we need to bring in the Muslims.
[00:40:28.885 --> 00:40:38.148]  Then they pay, the UN does, along with Peter Southerland, the UN, George Soros with our tax money, to bring the people 100 miles off the coast in international waters.
[00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:44.651]  Then the EU Navy comes and quote rescues them and brings them in to be resettled.
[00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:49.153]  And Italian homeowners and hotel owners are being thrown out
[00:40:49.813 --> 00:40:57.556]  Their guests are being thrown out and the islamicist 80 plus percent military age men being brought in are then put on welfare.
[00:40:58.376 --> 00:40:59.717]  This is the idea.
[00:40:59.737 --> 00:41:04.559]  This is the program and they say it is to quote replace Europeans.
[00:41:04.939 --> 00:41:15.683]  Then they teach in the news that white people are fundamentally evil and fundamentally bad and need to be gotten rid of and that white genocide is now taught in colleges.
[00:41:16.504 --> 00:41:16.904]  So again,
[00:41:18.462 --> 00:41:24.267]  The race-based Hitlerian plan, whether it's carried out by whites or carried out by others, is always very attractive.
[00:41:24.708 --> 00:41:27.330]  You read the Bible, different tribes are always exterminating each other.
[00:41:27.631 --> 00:41:29.933]  But the big megamanks are coming in.
[00:41:31.877 --> 00:41:45.479]  With the seven billion plus people, it'll be nine billion in just a few years in the third world, and using them as weapons against the West after the globalists have already exploited the continent of Africa, exploited other areas.
[00:41:45.819 --> 00:41:52.161]  But they're not bringing in people in ultra-massive numbers from, say, Brazil or other areas that have more libertarian or conservative backgrounds.
[00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:57.341]  They're bringing people in out of savage Muslim countries where women are kept as animals.
[00:41:57.781 --> 00:42:00.242]  Failed states like Somalia and Sudan.
[00:42:00.962 --> 00:42:06.284]  So to counter this, I am announcing a $20,000 contest.
[00:42:07.425 --> 00:42:19.830]  Because the media made fun of the video that I put out a few months ago, and Super Deluxe turned it into a video that had 20 million views in the last week, where I sung about how they basically cover up.
[00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:28.173]  There's a massive cover up when Islamists in Europe rape, bomb, shoot, stab, run people over with cars.
[00:42:29.434 --> 00:42:29.874]  And so
[00:42:31.497 --> 00:42:36.319]  I basically made a joke and said, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too.
[00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:37.379]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:42:37.719 --> 00:42:38.519]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:44.561]  Because when somebody screams Allah Akbar and stabs people, whether it's in San Francisco, whether it's in Minneapolis, St.
[00:42:44.601 --> 00:42:51.624]  Paul, or whether it's in New York City, or somebody shoots a cop in the back of the head yelling Allah Akbar, national media won't report it.
[00:42:52.404 --> 00:42:57.226]  So we're going to expose the type of immigrants, the type of invaders, the types that are being brought in.
[00:42:58.146 --> 00:42:58.826]  That'll be clear.
[00:42:58.906 --> 00:43:00.007]  You can't go to Sudan.
[00:43:00.047 --> 00:43:01.088]  You can't go to Somalia.
[00:43:01.128 --> 00:43:03.449]  You can't go to Saudi Arabia and be a Christian.
[00:43:03.769 --> 00:43:06.190]  You can't be a woman and not wear a burka over your head.
[00:43:06.431 --> 00:43:10.092]  You can't be a woman and drive a car or go shopping without your male controller.
[00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:12.054]  You can't be gay without being murdered.
[00:43:12.434 --> 00:43:22.119]  So standing up against these human rights abuses and standing up against this anti-western tyranny, so to counter this sinister move by global government forces to
[00:43:22.239 --> 00:43:32.010]  Crush what's left of the last few free nations that exist using huge third world hordes of Islamists that have already been exploited and stirred up by the globalists.
[00:43:32.291 --> 00:43:39.699]  We're launching an epic contest where you can add news clips, your own commentary into remixes
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:44:00.778]  I don't care, the more creative the better, but work into it the song that Time Warner and Super Deluxe thought would be so damaging to us in this meme war and expose the fact that the UN and others are pushing this massive agenda for us to have big open hearts and open ourselves up
[00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:05.860]  To more than just the 10 million Islamists that have already gone into Europe the last few years.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.480]  Again, 80% of them military-age men.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:14.581]  So Infowars is announcing this anti-globalist, anti-open border contest.
[00:44:15.261 --> 00:44:16.382]  There are three prizes.
[00:44:16.782 --> 00:44:17.682]  Let's go over them.
[00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:30.404]  Wait till the globalists and all their minions, using our taxpayer money to propagandize our own destruction, face the power of the people resisting through information warfare, through truth.
[00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:33.924]  $10,000 is the main prize.
[00:44:34.124 --> 00:44:34.904]  Best cover.
[00:44:35.625 --> 00:44:50.375]  Again, mix in clips, mix in remixes, mix in news, expose the globalist pedophile rings, expose the radical Islamic invasion, expose the whole UN program, mix it all together with the music performed by you or your band.
[00:44:50.395 --> 00:44:50.375]  $10,000.
[00:44:50.735 --> 00:44:52.977]  We just had a $20,000 winner in the CNN meme contest last week.
[00:44:57.321 --> 00:44:59.442]  Filmed from the best location, $5,000.
[00:45:00.382 --> 00:45:05.745]  And filmed with best audience participation, $5,000.
[00:45:06.305 --> 00:45:08.606]  That's three different winners.
[00:45:09.147 --> 00:45:16.150]  But so many people that entered the last meme contest, more than 8,000, didn't upload it to Facebook, Google, or Twitter.
[00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:20.732]  It's got to be uploaded to Facebook, YouTube, or to Twitter Periscope.
[00:45:20.832 --> 00:45:24.694]  Jordan Soros, Peter Sutherland, all of them admittedly are behind this plan.
[00:45:24.994 --> 00:45:26.295]  They're totally dastardly.
[00:45:26.535 --> 00:45:27.896]  They want to bring down the West.
[00:45:27.936 --> 00:45:29.317]  They want to bring down the third world.
[00:45:29.557 --> 00:45:30.938]  They want total degradation.
[00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:32.840]  They want city-states of ultra-rich.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:33.961]  Everybody poor.
[00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:36.783]  Obama told Africans they can't have cars or air conditioning.
[00:45:36.803 --> 00:45:38.244]  You know, they've got to come here.
[00:45:38.684 --> 00:45:41.466]  This is the plan to make us all poorer but a tiny elite.
[00:45:41.766 --> 00:45:43.488]  It's totally dastardly.
[00:45:44.088 --> 00:45:45.689]  So, again, it's multi-faceted.
[00:45:45.729 --> 00:45:46.709]  Expose globalism.
[00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:48.109]  Expose the ultra-rich.
[00:45:48.229 --> 00:45:50.690]  Expose the Vatican and all the pedophilia.
[00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.191]  Expose the Clintons and Jerry Epstein.
[00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:54.291]  Expose Weiner.
[00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:55.952]  Expose all their corruption.
[00:45:56.032 --> 00:45:57.172]  Expose the open borders.
[00:45:57.452 --> 00:45:58.673]  Expose the master plan.
[00:45:58.953 --> 00:46:02.474]  Expose how they cover up for Islamic terror and attacks and enslavement.
[00:46:03.394 --> 00:46:06.375]  And everybody that enters wins by spreading the word.
[00:46:06.415 --> 00:46:07.175]  They want to censor.
[00:46:07.375 --> 00:46:08.295]  They want to shut us up.
[00:46:08.335 --> 00:46:09.216]  They want to shut you up.
[00:46:09.536 --> 00:46:11.596]  We're going to the next level.
[00:46:12.217 --> 00:46:13.277]  This is going to be exciting.
[00:46:13.357 --> 00:46:15.197]  I can't wait to see all your entries.
[00:46:15.557 --> 00:46:19.238]  I'm Alex Jones counting on you because this is the InfoWar.
[00:46:19.479 --> 00:46:22.559]  And in the InfoWar, you are the resistance.
[00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:23.940]  You are the power.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:28.161]  You are the force that can destroy these globalist parasites.
[00:46:33.482 --> 00:46:35.924]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:46:36.525 --> 00:46:38.066]  It just pancaked.
[00:46:38.306 --> 00:46:40.868]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision implosion.
[00:46:45.152 --> 00:46:53.659]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.438 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.742 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.410]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.471]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:50.512]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.552 --> 00:48:51.152]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.079]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield, nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.099 --> 00:48:59.959]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.979 --> 00:49:00.319]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.721]  Some call it the heartland.
[00:49:01.741 --> 00:49:04.383]  Others call it America's breadbasket.
[00:49:10.874 --> 00:49:22.386]  Progressives call it flyover America, but those that live there call it home.
[00:49:25.229 --> 00:49:27.731]  I'm from Oklahoma and I am a very proud deplorable.
[00:49:28.071 --> 00:49:29.533]  I've been in Oklahoma 30 years.
[00:49:31.229 --> 00:49:32.049]  From Oklahoma City.
[00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:34.651]  Well, I kind of go back and forth between Texas and Oklahoma.
[00:49:34.851 --> 00:49:35.571]  I'm Kayleen.
[00:49:35.791 --> 00:49:36.852]  And I'm Charlene.
[00:49:37.252 --> 00:49:39.833]  And we're Fly Over America!
[00:49:40.173 --> 00:49:42.134]  Fly Over America!
[00:49:42.354 --> 00:49:44.035]  Woo!
[00:49:45.336 --> 00:49:47.197]  So what's it like living in Oklahoma?
[00:49:47.697 --> 00:49:48.717]  You know, it's pretty awesome.
[00:49:49.118 --> 00:49:51.018]  The people are down to earth.
[00:49:52.259 --> 00:49:54.580]  They just want good things for their family and their friends.
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:50:00.283]  It's a lot more diverse place and a lot more less backwards than people like to think we are.
[00:50:01.351 --> 00:50:02.812]  Well, I'm a professional auctioneer.
[00:50:02.832 --> 00:50:04.613]  I've been in the industry for 10 years.
[00:50:04.833 --> 00:50:08.915]  My job title is, well, it's not really, I can't say the title.
[00:50:08.995 --> 00:50:15.439]  I guess what I do is I go around the city and I pick up the deceased all over the city and surrounding Oklahoma areas.
[00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.039]  I sell electronics for a living.
[00:50:17.059 --> 00:50:17.960]  I have for the last
[00:50:19.207 --> 00:50:20.548]  Oh my goodness, almost 30 years.
[00:50:21.029 --> 00:50:23.151]  I drive a truck all over the US and Canada.
[00:50:23.891 --> 00:50:32.239]  I started off an auto body and now since they shut down my plant, I had to lay off over 10 people and it's been a long road.
[00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:33.821]  I've been through bankruptcy.
[00:50:34.301 --> 00:50:41.007]  Seems to be a race to zero with the way things have been set up and all the imported stuff coming from China and things like that.
[00:50:41.067 --> 00:50:44.871]  So it's just struggle after struggle, continuing to move on.
[00:50:45.444 --> 00:50:46.786]  I'm starting to get on my feet now.
[00:50:47.707 --> 00:50:48.427]  It's rough.
[00:50:48.708 --> 00:50:52.672]  With this Obamacare, it's really hurting us.
[00:50:52.912 --> 00:50:54.914]  I can't go out.
[00:50:54.954 --> 00:50:55.956]  I don't have insurance myself.
[00:50:56.416 --> 00:50:57.417]  I survived.
[00:50:57.457 --> 00:51:00.260]  That would be about the best way I could do it to prosper.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.421]  I wouldn't give it that word.
[00:51:01.822 --> 00:51:05.506]  I was certainly excited to hear a real change was coming.
[00:51:06.127 --> 00:51:11.032]  And certainly Trump was offering a real change for America and I was happy to be on board with him.
[00:51:11.413 --> 00:51:18.019]  It was probably one Hillary or Bernie sign for every 10 Trump signs.
[00:51:18.099 --> 00:51:18.460]  It was, uh...
[00:51:19.312 --> 00:51:20.372]  Quite a stark difference.
[00:51:20.432 --> 00:51:22.453]  I thought the election would be a landslide.
[00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:24.813]  Trump, because he's got balls.
[00:51:24.994 --> 00:51:27.834]  He wasn't part of the liberal establishment.
[00:51:27.854 --> 00:51:28.615]  He hadn't been there.
[00:51:28.875 --> 00:51:29.895]  He told you like it was.
[00:51:29.995 --> 00:51:34.896]  He wasn't afraid to tell the media that they were not correct.
[00:51:36.017 --> 00:51:37.137]  That's really what I like.
[00:51:37.177 --> 00:51:39.117]  He didn't take any crap and he still doesn't.
[00:51:39.317 --> 00:51:40.598]  And I think that's what we need.
[00:51:41.118 --> 00:51:42.578]  We need to put the U.S.
[00:51:42.638 --> 00:51:44.699]  first because we're going down the crapper.
[00:51:45.751 --> 00:51:47.712]  I think he's going to pull us back.
[00:51:48.173 --> 00:51:53.417]  I'd say one of the big things is that he brought God and Jesus back into the White House.
[00:51:53.917 --> 00:51:55.338]  Our Founding Fathers were Christians.
[00:51:56.259 --> 00:52:01.303]  They wrote the Constitution to give us those inalienable rights under God, not under some government.
[00:52:01.923 --> 00:52:09.889]  And if people would realize that and get behind it, we could make this country so great that none of the rest of the world would have a chance to compete.
[00:52:10.638 --> 00:52:12.339]  When the U.S.
[00:52:12.359 --> 00:52:16.582]  was founded, these positions weren't meant to be a career.
[00:52:17.522 --> 00:52:22.466]  If you were a farmer, you took a break from your farm for a couple years to go represent your country, then you went back to work.
[00:52:22.526 --> 00:52:25.348]  You didn't go for 30 years.
[00:52:25.868 --> 00:52:33.873]  First of all, I was going to have to stop all this liberal nonsense, burning American flags that my grandfather fought on the Philippine Islands.
[00:52:33.993 --> 00:52:39.136]  To see somebody step on or burn that flag, it's like stabbing me in the heart.
[00:52:40.612 --> 00:52:42.273]  It's just uncalled for.
[00:52:42.554 --> 00:52:44.395]  The society has really gone downhill.
[00:52:44.595 --> 00:52:45.616]  I've lost some acquaintances.
[00:52:46.357 --> 00:52:51.621]  I've lost some contact with some people who are intolerant, as they call us.
[00:52:52.181 --> 00:52:53.562]  You got the coastal elites.
[00:52:54.063 --> 00:52:58.626]  They have no clue what it's like to be here in America.
[00:52:58.726 --> 00:53:00.908]  The breadbasket, if you will.
[00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:02.870]  I mean, we're hard-working folks.
[00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:03.931]  We go to work every day.
[00:53:04.031 --> 00:53:05.192]  We put food on our table.
[00:53:05.292 --> 00:53:06.693]  We make sure our babies are fine.
[00:53:07.916 --> 00:53:12.798]  And to say that I just, I'm a complete racist?
[00:53:12.858 --> 00:53:14.138]  You have no clue who I am.
[00:53:14.719 --> 00:53:17.080]  You need to get on board because you're going to be left behind.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.561]  I mean, Trump is your president.
[00:53:20.401 --> 00:53:23.042]  I mean, there ain't nothing you could do about it.
[00:53:23.402 --> 00:53:24.823]  I mean, he's not going anywhere.
[00:53:26.243 --> 00:53:27.704]  You can say he's not your president.
[00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:30.565]  You can leave country like you said you were going to do.
[00:53:30.585 --> 00:53:33.466]  I mean, please, by all means, get that ticket and go.
[00:53:37.654 --> 00:53:47.640]  Well, I left California and I've been in Oklahoma for about five years now and I'd have to say it's a great state.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:59.307]  We have more red-pilled people and being a blue pill turning into a red pill myself, it's kind of eye-opening and people kind of think everyone here is just like cowboy, redneck.
[00:53:59.487 --> 00:54:00.147]  That's not true.
[00:54:00.628 --> 00:54:05.431]  Everyone here is really just more traditional than anything.
[00:54:05.711 --> 00:54:06.091]  Everyone
[00:54:06.989 --> 00:54:11.453]  Is open to new ideas and just kind of friendly to each other.
[00:54:11.473 --> 00:54:13.214]  That's really good.
[00:54:13.254 --> 00:54:21.101]  And you know, you were telling me a story about your school and how at your school they voted on who was going to vote for Hillary and Trump.
[00:54:21.141 --> 00:54:22.082]  Can you tell us about that?
[00:54:22.943 --> 00:54:28.607]  Oh, um, at my school we had our very own election.
[00:54:28.627 --> 00:54:31.890]  It was between Hillary and Trump.
[00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:35.193]  We had like the, we had, it was going on for a week.
[00:54:37.937 --> 00:54:39.418]  The same week as the election.
[00:54:41.078 --> 00:54:48.522]  And I kept saying in my journal about what they were saying about Trump, like about my opinion.
[00:54:48.562 --> 00:54:51.624]  I kept saying vote for Trump with these things.
[00:54:51.804 --> 00:54:52.445]  With a heart?
[00:54:52.625 --> 00:54:54.446]  So you're doing a heart and vote for Trump?
[00:54:56.287 --> 00:54:57.607]  I am a huge Trump fan.
[00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:04.353]  We got to make posters.
[00:55:04.614 --> 00:55:07.916]  I made my vote for Trump.
[00:55:10.838 --> 00:55:13.140]  I said, make America great again.
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.500]  Oh wow!
[00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:15.361]  Very cool!
[00:55:15.741 --> 00:55:16.962]  So do you have a lot of friends?
[00:55:16.982 --> 00:55:19.344]  I know you were talking about one of your friends.
[00:55:19.364 --> 00:55:24.928]  My best friend, Lena, she voted for Hillary.
[00:55:25.658 --> 00:55:29.699]  And I told her what Hillary was going to do and what Trump was going to do.
[00:55:30.379 --> 00:55:35.961]  So I told her that she didn't know what they were going to do.
[00:55:36.461 --> 00:55:44.284]  I'm just guessing that they were, that she just wanted a girl for president for once.
[00:55:44.364 --> 00:55:48.325]  But then I told her, then she said, I'm going to Trump's side.
[00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:52.586]  So in our election, Trump won by one point.
[00:55:56.169 --> 00:55:56.489]  On it.
[00:55:57.550 --> 00:55:58.291]  Very cool.
[00:55:58.371 --> 00:56:00.212]  So Trump won twice in it.
[00:56:00.232 --> 00:56:02.274]  He won twice in it?
[00:56:02.454 --> 00:56:03.155]  Very cool.
[00:56:03.215 --> 00:56:12.382]  So what do you think about some of the people who are telling young girls to want to vote for Hillary because then we'd have a female president?
[00:56:13.202 --> 00:56:18.927]  I think, I think it's just not right because people have their own right to vote.
[00:56:18.947 --> 00:56:19.027]  Like,
[00:56:23.438 --> 00:56:27.782]  We have our own right to vote here, so yeah.
[00:56:28.383 --> 00:56:35.791]  Right, so women have the right to vote, so we should be able to vote for who we want to vote for, not just because they're a woman, but who's the best candidate.
[00:56:36.511 --> 00:56:41.657]  Yeah, it's basically they're just telling you what to do because you're a girl.
[00:56:42.605 --> 00:56:43.645]  Yeah, my mom's mom had to.
[00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:02.753]  Your grandma, my mom, finally got her citizenship and she got a job.
[00:57:03.193 --> 00:57:04.354]  So she wait her turn.
[00:57:04.794 --> 00:57:20.124]  And so the reason why some of my family loves Trump is that he's all about making it equal for everybody to wait their turn to come here and then get their jobs the right way, get their citizenship the right way, not just take it from people that are waiting in line.
[00:57:20.785 --> 00:57:22.206]  What was your opinion on Obamacare?
[00:57:23.066 --> 00:57:26.509]  I tried signing up for it a few years back and I couldn't get it.
[00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:27.369]  It was just too high.
[00:57:27.389 --> 00:57:28.210]  I couldn't afford it.
[00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:34.816]  So, um, I feel like I agree when you say, you know, Infowars even says, you know, just repeal it.
[00:57:34.936 --> 00:57:36.197]  You don't even need to replace it.
[00:57:36.377 --> 00:57:38.159]  Just repeal Obamacare already.
[00:57:38.199 --> 00:57:39.240]  Nobody can afford it.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:40.541]  No families can.
[00:57:40.641 --> 00:57:42.082]  You know, I tried signing up for it.
[00:57:42.623 --> 00:57:45.385]  It was well over what I could even afford.
[00:57:45.426 --> 00:57:47.928]  It was like a mortgage just to pay for Obamacare.
[00:57:48.857 --> 00:57:50.098]  I've tried most of the supplements.
[00:57:50.138 --> 00:57:53.340]  It's probably easier to tell you which ones I haven't tried than the ones I have tried.
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:58.723]  And every one of them have been pretty amazing, and I can definitely feel the difference.
[00:57:59.964 --> 00:58:07.869]  Since I started taking them, probably about a year and a half ago, I've lost about 45 pounds, which is hard to believe because I still look like I need to lose another 100 or so.
[00:58:08.989 --> 00:58:09.349]  We're good.
[00:58:20.993 --> 00:58:23.534]  I can't say anything non-positive about them.
[00:58:23.554 --> 00:58:24.475]  They're just great products.
[00:58:24.915 --> 00:58:27.656]  Alex, we really need women's shirts so bad.
[00:58:27.976 --> 00:58:30.077]  Please give us cute shirts to wear.
[00:58:30.097 --> 00:58:34.559]  Yeah, cute Infowar shirts, some tank tops, some soft tees.
[00:58:35.039 --> 00:58:38.681]  For us women, we don't want to look like guys because there's only two genders.
[00:58:39.001 --> 00:58:40.642]  We just need women's shirts.
[00:58:40.762 --> 00:58:41.202]  Please!
[00:58:41.542 --> 00:58:42.063]  I'll buy them.
[00:58:42.183 --> 00:58:42.803]  I'll buy them all.
