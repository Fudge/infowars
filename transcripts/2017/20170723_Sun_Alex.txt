[00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:15.977]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:15.977 --> 00:00:20.018]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex Jones on a Sunday.
[00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:22.619]  The crew did a great job today getting this broadcast ready.
[00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.980]  A short staffed crew and we are still live on a Sunday in the big studio.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.441]  And I'm feeling extra patriotic today.
[00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:34.542]  I have my American flag tie on with my American flag lapel.
[00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:36.922]  I've got the classic blue jacket on.
[00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:40.783]  We've got the red, white, and blue in the background flowing.
[00:00:40.783 --> 00:00:46.784]  And that's because we're leading off today's broadcast with the good news.
[00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:52.206]  RasmussenPolls reports Americans are happier than they have been in years.
[00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.188]  And a follow-up story from the Washington Examiner.
[00:00:57.188 --> 00:00:58.889]  Americans have never felt better.
[00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.850]  74% very happy.
[00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.434]  A new Rasmussen Report survey said that 74% of adults rate the life as good or excellent.
[00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:12.656]  The highest level of satisfaction ever recorded by the pollster.
[00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:14.157]  How do you like that?
[00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.758]  Ever recorded!
[00:01:16.758 --> 00:01:22.962]  So, according to this poll, Americans are happier than ever before.
[00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:27.923]  Isn't that incredible?
[00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:43.646]  Now I'm glad that Alex leaves this little ditty here lying at the desk because I have a feeling that on this Sunday, July 23rd, I wouldn't be reading this headline if this headline were true.
[00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:47.387]  If this headline from Newsweek, Madame President, was true,
[00:01:48.604 --> 00:01:57.726]  From November 9th, I wouldn't be reading you this headline from July 20th, Americans have never felt better.
[00:01:57.726 --> 00:02:00.567]  So you see how that works, folks?
[00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:13.390]  Because this scathing, wicked witch of the West, who still won't go away, this wretched creature, you got her husband popping up on boats with Pierce Brosnan now, looks like death warmed over.
[00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.051]  In fact, looks like death, not even warmed over anymore.
[00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:18.334]  But they're in the past.
[00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:19.455]  That's the beauty of it.
[00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:34.308]  They are in the past, and no matter what you think about Trump, Trump is trying to make America surge again, and the momentum and the patriotism behind him are real.
[00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:42.655]  And that is why this Rasmussen poll indicates Americans are happier than ever before.
[00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:48.410]  Now, it's resonating in other parts of life as well.
[00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.835]  Food stamp use falls to lowest level in seven years.
[00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:54.815]  That is from Breitbart.
[00:02:54.815 --> 00:03:02.061]  Participation in the food stamp program took a dive to the lowest level it has been in seven years, according to new data from the U.S.
[00:03:02.061 --> 00:03:04.623]  Department of Agriculture.
[00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:05.003]  Wow!
[00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:06.124]  How do you like that?
[00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:09.067]  You don't have to rely on the government for your daily meal.
[00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:13.030]  You don't have to rely on the government for ends meet, and you end up happier.
[00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:16.725]  Shocking!
[00:03:16.725 --> 00:03:19.205]  Shocking!
[00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:21.165]  We've got some clips from Chuck Schumer.
[00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:23.226]  Oh, oh, oh, by the way, here's another news story.
[00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:24.726]  This is from Gravion.
[00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:32.088]  As gas prices fall to a 12-year low, so there's the story to just add on to everything else here.
[00:03:32.088 --> 00:03:35.608]  Gas prices have just hit a 12-year low.
[00:03:35.608 --> 00:03:36.869]  We'll get the exact numbers.
[00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:43.010]  But despite that, you have Chuck Schumer who says that gas prices will never go down.
[00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:55.595]  The pastrami sandwich salesman who you would never buy a pastrami sandwich from, the nationwide price for gas closed the week of July 17th at $2.39 a gallon, down from $2.47 a gallon when Trump took office.
[00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:07.289]  So, in 7 months, the gas prices have gone down 8 cents a gallon.
[00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.571]  I suppose that's on average.
[00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:13.015]  Over the July 4th holiday weekend, gas prices were at their lowest point since 2005.
[00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:19.047]  So that's what they're indicating lowest in the last 12 years.
[00:04:19.047 --> 00:04:23.047]  And this is crippling Russia's oil industry and gas market.
[00:04:23.047 --> 00:04:25.228]  But oh my gosh!
[00:04:25.228 --> 00:04:27.648]  Trump is a Russian agent!
[00:04:27.648 --> 00:04:29.369]  Can you believe this madman?
[00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:30.989]  Look at these headlines!
[00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:34.069]  Americans, they need less food stamps than ever before.
[00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.450]  Less Americans on food stamps.
[00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.250]  Gas prices 12 year low.
[00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.691]  Americans happier than ever before according to Rasmussen.
[00:04:41.691 --> 00:04:42.591]  Thanks Russia!
[00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:45.653]  Thank you, Russia!
[00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:55.104]  Boy, I'm so glad that Russia got Trump in instead of Hillary so I can come on air today with my American flag tie on and say I'm better than I've ever felt before!
[00:04:55.104 --> 00:04:56.486]  Thank you, Russia!
[00:04:56.486 --> 00:04:58.929]  Now more from Chuck Schumer, the fake American.
[00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:01.331]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[00:05:01.932 --> 00:05:06.137]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:05:06.137 --> 00:05:12.845]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:16.589]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:36.799]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:41.483]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:52.715]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:05:52.715 --> 00:05:57.820]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:06:06.222 --> 00:06:14.901]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:20.164 --> 00:06:22.667]  So we've covered the good news today.
[00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:25.869]  Americans are happier than they've ever been before.
[00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:27.491]  That's according to a Rasmussen poll.
[00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:29.473]  We have nothing but Russia to thank for that.
[00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:31.735]  You can just ask Chuck Schumer himself.
[00:06:31.735 --> 00:06:34.217]  Food stamp usage, the lowest in seven years.
[00:06:34.217 --> 00:06:37.920]  Gas prices, the lowest in 12 years.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.181]  That's some of the stuff we've covered.
[00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:40.002]  More stuff to cover.
[00:06:41.383 --> 00:06:47.646]  A bunch of dead bodies have been found in a tractor trailer at a San Antonio Walmart.
[00:06:47.646 --> 00:06:54.310]  The San Antonio police chief, William McManus, has said, we are looking at this as a human trafficking issue.
[00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.472]  So we'll be sure to keep you posted on that.
[00:06:57.472 --> 00:07:02.394]  There's been some interesting coverage of that as well that we'll mention.
[00:07:02.394 --> 00:07:06.076]  Joseph Rago, Wall Street Journal editor, dies at 34.
[00:07:08.592 --> 00:07:17.194]  Now, this is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, you didn't hear too much about the unexpected death of Joseph Rago.
[00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:26.937]  The last story he wrote for the Washington Post, I want to get the right headline here, the Obamacare Republicans
[00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:30.087]  It was July 18th.
[00:07:30.087 --> 00:07:33.530]  Senate Republicans killed their own health care bill on Monday evening.
[00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.491]  And it goes on and on.
[00:07:35.491 --> 00:07:36.932]  So he was covering Obamacare.
[00:07:36.932 --> 00:07:40.114]  He was very critical of Obamacare.
[00:07:40.114 --> 00:07:41.175]  And he's dead.
[00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:45.478]  I'm not sure if there's anything to be suspicious of there.
[00:07:45.478 --> 00:07:55.705]  Just like there's nothing to be suspicious of with Peter Smith, Klaus Eberwein, Sean Lucas, Barrington Weisenant, Seth Rich, Monica Peterson.
[00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.991]  John Ash.
[00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:00.592]  This is just about the last year and a half.
[00:08:00.592 --> 00:08:01.753]  I'm just going off memory here.
[00:08:01.753 --> 00:08:02.754]  Did I forget any guys?
[00:08:02.754 --> 00:08:05.256]  Any names I forgot?
[00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:06.376]  DNC fraud lawsuit.
[00:08:06.376 --> 00:08:07.157]  Clinton body count.
[00:08:07.157 --> 00:08:08.058]  I think I covered them all.
[00:08:08.058 --> 00:08:09.759]  But nothing suspicious about that.
[00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:13.982]  These people just dying week in and week out.
[00:08:13.982 --> 00:08:18.605]  I'll also keep you posted on anything developing in the tractor trailer with the humans found on it.
[00:08:19.974 --> 00:08:21.295]  We've got some other stories as well.
[00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:25.916]  Hungarian PM Soros EU trying to establish a Muslimized Europe.
[00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:28.097]  We'll talk about that.
[00:08:28.097 --> 00:08:30.318]  And then there was some other weird news too.
[00:08:30.318 --> 00:08:33.139]  I think it was the Dilyanophiles.
[00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:34.340]  Am I saying that right, Zach?
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.401]  The Dilyanophiles with John McCain implicated.
[00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:43.663]  So we'll look into that and this purple shovel program that I'd never heard of until today.
[00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:45.264]  So all kinds of weird stuff.
[00:08:45.264 --> 00:08:47.765]  And most of America has no clue about any of this.
[00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:51.593]  But that's fine, because this is Trump's America now.
[00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:55.375]  We are winning, and Americans are happier than they've ever been before.
[00:08:55.375 --> 00:08:56.696]  But let's go to Chuck Schumer.
[00:08:56.696 --> 00:08:58.938]  Chuck Schumer, he's not one of those Americans.
[00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:03.641]  Chuck Schumer might be more miserable than he's ever been before, actually, to be honest.
[00:09:03.641 --> 00:09:16.470]  And he was on the air with Stephanopoulos trying to talk about how it's Democrats that are going to fill the vacuum that Trump left.
[00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.971]  The vacuum that Trump left.
[00:09:19.312 --> 00:09:21.974]  Which really doesn't make sense if you try to put that into context.
[00:09:21.974 --> 00:09:25.717]  He's been in office for seven months now, so I don't know how he's leaving vacuums.
[00:09:25.717 --> 00:09:33.303]  But this is Chuck Schumer trying to reason his way around thinking Trump is bad.
[00:09:33.303 --> 00:09:36.386]  Why don't Americans know where the Democrats stand for it, and is that your fault?
[00:09:37.116 --> 00:09:39.957]  Well, it is in part our fault when you lose an election.
[00:09:39.957 --> 00:09:40.878]  We asked if it's your fault.
[00:09:40.878 --> 00:09:45.780]  Someone who has, say, 40% popularity, you look in the mirror and say, what did we do wrong?
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.942]  And the number one thing that we did wrong is we didn't have... Can we pause that?
[00:09:49.942 --> 00:09:54.284]  See, this is what I'm talking about.
[00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:56.245]  This is what people like Chuck Schumer do.
[00:09:56.245 --> 00:10:00.927]  They just go on there and then they just say that as if it's a matter of fact.
[00:10:00.927 --> 00:10:02.988]  Well, this is a president that, you know, he only had 40% approval rate.
[00:10:05.984 --> 00:10:06.804]  What are you talking about?
[00:10:06.804 --> 00:10:07.345]  What are you talking about?
[00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:08.706]  Rigged polls again?
[00:10:08.706 --> 00:10:10.727]  Rigged polls Chuck Schumer?
[00:10:10.727 --> 00:10:14.849]  I just highly doubt that President Trump's approval rating is really only 40% right now.
[00:10:14.849 --> 00:10:18.251]  But he just puts that out there like... See, Americans just hate this President.
[00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:19.172]  Americans just hate Trump.
[00:10:19.172 --> 00:10:20.352]  That's just a matter of fact.
[00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:21.833]  No, that's not a matter of fact.
[00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:22.614]  Keep rolling Chuck Schumer.
[00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.697]  You don't stand for anything.
[00:10:24.697 --> 00:10:24.737]  Oh.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:45.880]  Yeah!
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.761]  Yeah they are!
[00:10:46.761 --> 00:10:47.761]  Oh my gosh.
[00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:48.942]  Like in Illinois?
[00:10:48.942 --> 00:10:49.202]  California?
[00:10:49.202 --> 00:10:50.943]  Is that where everyone's moving to Texas?
[00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:11.630]  See, here's Chuck Schumer.
[00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:12.270]  Hold on for a second.
[00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:12.770]  Here's Chuck Schumer
[00:11:38.883 --> 00:11:42.384]  Playing the typical liberal, the typical democrat approach.
[00:11:42.384 --> 00:11:44.145]  We're gonna help you.
[00:11:44.145 --> 00:11:45.446]  We're gonna be here for you.
[00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:46.986]  You need higher wages?
[00:11:46.986 --> 00:11:48.567]  We're gonna take care of it.
[00:11:48.567 --> 00:11:49.567]  You need more money?
[00:11:49.567 --> 00:11:50.387]  You need food?
[00:11:50.387 --> 00:11:51.828]  You need, you need, you need.
[00:11:51.828 --> 00:11:52.888]  You need.
[00:11:52.888 --> 00:11:54.209]  You are a victim.
[00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:55.769]  You are in need.
[00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:56.570]  Didn't you know it?
[00:11:57.734 --> 00:11:58.635]  Don't you know it?
[00:11:58.635 --> 00:11:59.696]  I'm Chuck Schumer.
[00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:02.439]  You need a dirty pastrami sandwich.
[00:12:02.439 --> 00:12:03.520]  I'm Chuck Schumer.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.201]  So he's telling me, you're in need.
[00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:06.262]  You need this.
[00:12:06.262 --> 00:12:07.383]  You're a victim.
[00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:08.605]  You've been scrutinized.
[00:12:08.605 --> 00:12:10.206]  You've been victimized.
[00:12:10.206 --> 00:12:10.967]  I'll help.
[00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:11.748]  We'll help.
[00:12:11.748 --> 00:12:12.809]  The Democrats will help.
[00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:14.010]  The government will help.
[00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:14.450]  No!
[00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.532]  No, Chuck Schumer.
[00:12:16.532 --> 00:12:18.174]  The government has got us here.
[00:12:18.174 --> 00:12:18.935]  But you know that.
[00:12:18.935 --> 00:12:19.856]  You're a dirty dealer.
[00:12:19.856 --> 00:12:20.857]  Go ahead and roll on with Chuck.
[00:12:23.058 --> 00:12:34.367]  Well, are you going to appeal to the Obama coalition, you know, young people, LGBT, people of color, or the identity politics, Democrats who voted for Trump, blue-collar voters?
[00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:36.208]  This will appeal to both.
[00:12:36.208 --> 00:12:45.095]  It will unify the Democratic Party because we are united on economic issues and a bold, sharp-edged message.
[00:12:45.095 --> 00:12:47.336]  Hold it right there.
[00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:49.438]  What economic issues is he talking about here?
[00:12:50.572 --> 00:12:55.473]  Is he talking about the economic issues of the $20 trillion in debt this country's under?
[00:12:55.473 --> 00:12:56.694]  The deficit spending?
[00:12:56.694 --> 00:12:58.134]  I'm sorry, what is he exactly talking about?
[00:12:58.134 --> 00:13:02.655]  Because these were all prevalent during the Obama administration more than ever.
[00:13:02.655 --> 00:13:08.217]  So he's sitting here saying, we need to resonate with the people that supported Obama, the Obama people.
[00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:12.740]  We need to get behind our economic plan here.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.621]  What economic plan?
[00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:16.062]  To put us into more debt?
[00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:19.264]  The economic plan that has California teetering on collapse?
[00:13:19.264 --> 00:13:21.105]  Illinois teetering on collapse?
[00:13:21.105 --> 00:13:22.326]  That economic plan?
[00:13:22.326 --> 00:13:28.470]  The economic plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on special elections and then go over?
[00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.951]  That economic plan?
[00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:31.232]  How about the economic plan
[00:13:32.452 --> 00:13:34.474]  For Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[00:13:34.474 --> 00:13:35.995]  Did that work out for you?
[00:13:35.995 --> 00:13:37.917]  No, they have no economic plan.
[00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.278]  They have no deal.
[00:13:39.278 --> 00:13:40.359]  They have nothing.
[00:13:40.359 --> 00:13:42.361]  All they have is Trump bad.
[00:13:42.361 --> 00:13:43.382]  You're a victim.
[00:13:43.382 --> 00:13:44.403]  Trump is bad.
[00:13:44.403 --> 00:13:45.464]  That's all they have.
[00:13:45.464 --> 00:13:47.266]  Let's see if Chuck Schumer has anything else in this clip.
[00:13:48.268 --> 00:13:52.449]  There you are, you're a victim!
[00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:59.371]  But we've got a problem, as you know, we've got a problem with wage stagnation.
[00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:00.912]  You talk about better wages.
[00:14:00.912 --> 00:14:03.052]  We've had a problem with wage stagnation for the last 40 years.
[00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:04.493]  What can any piece of legislation do about that?
[00:14:08.894 --> 00:14:15.675]  Well, we have researched this thoroughly and talked to all different kinds of people, and there are lots of things that we can do.
[00:14:15.675 --> 00:14:17.435]  And let me just say one more thing about this.
[00:14:17.435 --> 00:14:20.436]  You know, Donald Trump campaigned sort of on this message.
[00:14:20.436 --> 00:14:21.776]  He was a populist.
[00:14:21.776 --> 00:14:23.937]  He campaigned against the establishment.
[00:14:23.937 --> 00:14:33.658]  As soon as he got into office, he embraced the Koch brother hard right and abandoned his plans to clean up Wall Street, to drain the swamp, to be tough on trade.
[00:14:33.658 --> 00:14:35.899]  Well, you'll be out of there soon, so calm down.
[00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:38.119]  And he's definitely been tough on trade.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.262]  Look, the Democrats keep using this whole thing.
[00:14:42.262 --> 00:14:47.345]  They want to tell you that they're going to provide you a $15 an hour minimum wage.
[00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.567]  There was a story, it may have been my hometown of St.
[00:14:49.567 --> 00:14:50.127]  Louis, guys.
[00:14:50.127 --> 00:14:50.708]  Look this up.
[00:14:51.727 --> 00:14:53.609]  It might have been in Baltimore, actually.
[00:14:53.609 --> 00:14:54.850]  Maybe it was Baltimore.
[00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.733]  There was some mayor, some councilwoman, and they had the whole thing proposed.
[00:14:58.733 --> 00:15:01.976]  They were about to raise minimum wage to $15 an hour.
[00:15:01.976 --> 00:15:03.037]  They had the votes.
[00:15:03.037 --> 00:15:04.318]  They had the bill.
[00:15:04.318 --> 00:15:09.944]  And then they had to retract it because they realized that no one could afford to pay you anymore.
[00:15:10.768 --> 00:15:25.553]  So here were all these Democrats, here were all of these liberals, all pumped up, all fired up, they were going to get the minimum wage bill up, and then they actually looked at the logistics, broke it down economically, talked to the local business people and realized,
[00:15:26.735 --> 00:15:29.538]  This isn't going to work.
[00:15:29.538 --> 00:15:33.521]  Nobody can afford to pay you $15 an hour.
[00:15:33.521 --> 00:15:39.887]  And we don't have the robot workers quite in yet, so we can't just bring the robot workers in yet to replace you.
[00:15:39.887 --> 00:15:41.108]  That's another 10 years away.
[00:15:41.108 --> 00:15:42.869]  Yeah, there it is in Baltimore.
[00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:50.037]  So this is the same person, the same person that passed the bill to raise the minimum wage, vetoed it.
[00:15:50.037 --> 00:15:52.880]  Mayor Catherine Pugh!
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.024]  I'm telling you folks, these people have no plan!
[00:15:56.024 --> 00:15:57.786]  We'll be right back with more of Uptruck Schumer.
[00:15:58.993 --> 00:16:03.656]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:16:03.656 --> 00:16:16.603]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:16:16.603 --> 00:16:23.187]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:16:23.187 --> 00:16:25.648]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:36.931]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:39.292]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.

[00:19:09.552 --> 00:19:17.616]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:22.818]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:19:43.806 --> 00:19:48.289]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:04.458]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:19.439]  You've found it, the tip of the spear.
[00:20:19.439 --> 00:20:26.661]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Schroeder.
[00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:30.882]  How absurd is it for us to love America here at InfoWars.com?
[00:20:30.882 --> 00:20:32.182]  I can't believe we love America.
[00:20:32.182 --> 00:20:34.143]  I can't believe we're patriots.
[00:20:34.143 --> 00:20:35.243]  I can't believe we like Trump.
[00:20:35.243 --> 00:20:37.703]  I can't believe we want America to remain a sovereign nation.
[00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:39.804]  I mean, how dare us?
[00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:41.404]  I mean, you've seen them on the news, folks.
[00:20:41.404 --> 00:20:43.125]  How dare we want to sell our own products?
[00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:52.873]  I mean, I'm gonna, even though Rachel Maddow said it's bad, I'm gonna go ahead and let you know, folks, we now have another new product.
[00:20:52.873 --> 00:21:04.057]  That is, I mean, it's unbelievable that we want to bring you healthy products, that we want to fill your home with all natural deodorants and soaps and sunscreens and bug sprays and water filters and all that stuff.
[00:21:04.057 --> 00:21:11.299]  I mean, I can't believe that patriots would want to fund one another and help one another out and give them good products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:13.200]  But we've decided to give you another product.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.863]  You wanted the whey protein, so we decided that we were going to give you the whey protein.
[00:21:18.863 --> 00:21:21.585]  Get the new, true whey protein.
[00:21:21.585 --> 00:21:25.888]  And not only do we bring you new products, we bring you new products and we bring it with 25% off.
[00:21:25.888 --> 00:21:28.950]  So 25% off the introduction of the true whey protein.
[00:21:33.713 --> 00:21:40.355]  Ultimate Protein Pack is the 25% off Caveman and True Whey Protein if you want to do the protein pack.
[00:21:40.355 --> 00:21:42.336]  But folks, you're going to love this new whey protein.
[00:21:42.336 --> 00:21:44.256]  I know a lot of people that do whey protein.
[00:21:44.256 --> 00:21:45.937]  It's a very popular product.
[00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:50.919]  I'm obviously going to be switching to the True Whey Protein at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:58.121]  And it's a grass-fed whey protein and it's got nine essential amino acids that your body needs that can't produce itself.
[00:21:59.426 --> 00:22:07.810]  So, and I gotta tell ya, we've actually had bottles of this floating around the office, we've been shooting ads, Alex has been shooting some ads telling you about this new protein, folks.
[00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.571]  It is, honestly, I don't like vanilla proteins.
[00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:15.694]  I maybe got one vanilla protein in my entire life, didn't like it, I've been chocolate ever since.
[00:22:16.554 --> 00:22:21.918]  This is the best tasting vanilla anything I've ever tasted.
[00:22:21.918 --> 00:22:25.061]  Better than any ice cream, even if you got two scoops.
[00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:31.946]  If you get two scoops of True Whey Vanilla Protein, it's better than two scoops of any covfefe ice cream that you've ever had.
[00:22:31.946 --> 00:22:36.530]  But I'm telling you, the protein, all natural, grass fed, and the flavor is the best
[00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.451]  We're good to go!
[00:23:03.846 --> 00:23:11.212]  Now, you've got a source, infowarstore.com, to get an all-natural protein and support this broadcast.
[00:23:11.212 --> 00:23:15.015]  So, check that out and you will be a returned customer, I guarantee it.
[00:23:15.015 --> 00:23:18.058]  Can't wait to see those five-star reviews coming in.
[00:23:18.058 --> 00:23:24.524]  All right, well, we were giving Chuck, or excuse me, up Chuck Schumer the business before we went to the last break.
[00:23:24.524 --> 00:23:29.408]  Let's finish up with this Chuck Schumer clip from, what show is it?
[00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.629]  We got George Step on, all of us?
[00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:34.626]  Okay, so this is up Chuck Schumer on George Step on all of us.
[00:23:34.626 --> 00:23:36.587]  Let's go ahead and finish this clip.
[00:23:36.587 --> 00:23:39.368]  We are going to propose tomorrow.
[00:23:39.368 --> 00:23:40.909]  We've already proposed a few things.
[00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:43.111]  A trillion dollar infrastructure plan.
[00:23:43.111 --> 00:23:46.693]  Trump, I don't know where he is on infrastructure, but we're going to work with him on that.
[00:23:46.693 --> 00:23:47.193]  He's clueless.
[00:23:47.193 --> 00:23:50.755]  We've proposed already a $15 minimum wage.
[00:23:50.755 --> 00:23:52.056]  Trump won't go for that.
[00:23:52.056 --> 00:23:56.838]  We've proposed childcare, a family leave proposal that works well.
[00:23:56.838 --> 00:23:59.040]  Here's what we're going to propose tomorrow.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.161]  Number one, we're going to go after the drug companies.
[00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:14.011]  We will create a special, special office that will just go after these drug companies when they raise prices so egregiously and people can't afford these drugs.
[00:24:14.011 --> 00:24:18.095]  Wow!
[00:24:18.095 --> 00:24:23.059]  Chuck Schumer wants to go after drug companies that raise the prices astronomically.
[00:24:26.035 --> 00:24:31.280]  What else is going on in the medical industry right now where prices are being raised astronomically?
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.140]  Oh, that's right!
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.923]  Obamacare!
[00:24:34.923 --> 00:24:36.764]  Obamacare!
[00:24:36.764 --> 00:24:38.846]  Premium skyrocketing!
[00:24:38.846 --> 00:24:40.968]  Deductible skyrocketing!
[00:24:40.968 --> 00:24:44.751]  Monthly rates skyrocketing!
[00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:45.312]  Oh, but, but...
[00:24:46.061 --> 00:24:51.386]  But Chuck Schumer wants to make sure that the drug companies aren't skyrocketing their prices.
[00:24:51.386 --> 00:24:55.689]  I mean, this is so hypocritical.
[00:24:55.689 --> 00:25:00.253]  This is so the pot calling the kettle black that it makes you nauseous.
[00:25:00.253 --> 00:25:05.858]  That there's even a human being that would get up and lie to you and be such a fraud like this.
[00:25:05.858 --> 00:25:09.821]  So again, Obamacare premiums skyrocketing.
[00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:11.443]  You know, just nobody can afford it anymore.
[00:25:12.401 --> 00:25:13.362]  But here's Chuck Schumer.
[00:25:13.362 --> 00:25:16.764]  He's going to do something about the drug companies raising their prices.
[00:25:16.764 --> 00:25:17.625]  Wait a second!
[00:25:17.625 --> 00:25:18.626]  Upchuck?
[00:25:18.626 --> 00:25:21.969]  I thought that that was what Obamacare was for.
[00:25:21.969 --> 00:25:23.270]  Hmm.
[00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.852]  I guess Obamacare failed again.
[00:25:25.852 --> 00:25:30.335]  Oh, and you notice that Chuck Schumer has no problem with the opioid epidemic.
[00:25:30.335 --> 00:25:31.396]  Doesn't mention that.
[00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:38.441]  He's going to go after the big drug companies because they're rising prices, but ignore all of the deaths that are associated with that.
[00:25:38.441 --> 00:25:39.382]  That's just fine.
[00:25:39.382 --> 00:25:40.243]  Let's go back to Upchuck.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.361]  And people can't afford these drugs.
[00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:47.482]  We're going to change the way companies can merge.
[00:25:47.482 --> 00:25:50.743]  We have these huge companies buying up other big companies.
[00:25:50.743 --> 00:25:53.123]  It hurts workers and it hurts prices.
[00:25:53.123 --> 00:25:56.924]  The old Adam Smith idea of competition, it's gone.
[00:25:56.924 --> 00:26:00.365]  So people hate it when their cable bills go up, their airline fees.
[00:26:00.365 --> 00:26:02.286]  They know that gas prices are still going up.
[00:26:02.286 --> 00:26:03.626]  But again, Obamacare is skyrocketing.
[00:26:03.626 --> 00:26:04.987]  Hold on, hold on, hold on right there.
[00:26:06.227 --> 00:26:09.249]  Again, he's sitting here complaining about prices going up.
[00:26:09.249 --> 00:26:14.873]  Again, he's saying he's going to get involved, we're going to get the government involved, we're going to stop these rising prices.
[00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:16.333]  Doesn't mention Obamacare.
[00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:19.816]  This guy's on the Hill every day defending Obamacare!
[00:26:20.785 --> 00:26:28.433]  And then he goes on George Step on all of us on ABC and says, I'm going to stop the prices on the drugs from getting too big.
[00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:37.202]  We're going to stop big companies from buying one another and then making the prices too big on your energy bill, your electricity bill, your cable bill and all this.
[00:26:37.202 --> 00:26:43.309]  Meanwhile, the Democrats made unaffordable health care and they want to kill the coal industry that keeps energy affordable.
[00:26:44.517 --> 00:26:49.206]  Trump has got the gas to the lowest price in 12 years that's hurting the Russia.
[00:26:49.206 --> 00:26:52.893]  This guy's up here complaining!
[00:26:52.893 --> 00:26:53.694]  Go back to hell, Chuck.
[00:26:55.069 --> 00:27:02.514]  The domestic price goes, uh, when the price for oil goes up on the markets, it goes right up, but it never goes down.
[00:27:02.514 --> 00:27:04.695]  How the heck did we let- Never goes down.
[00:27:04.695 --> 00:27:06.436]  That was democrat inflation!
[00:27:06.436 --> 00:27:07.957]  Go ahead and pause it right there.
[00:27:07.957 --> 00:27:09.398]  Again though, again though.
[00:27:09.398 --> 00:27:14.061]  No mention of Amazon buying out everything and then having a deal with the United States Postal Service.
[00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:18.384]  No mention of Google and Alphabet and those big services buying up everything.
[00:27:18.644 --> 00:27:22.467]  No mention of the six industries, or the six companies that own all the media.
[00:27:22.467 --> 00:27:23.268]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:27:23.268 --> 00:27:24.949]  Schumer has no problem with that.
[00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:33.636]  But then he tells you that gas prices never go down, even though they're the lowest they've been in 12 years!
[00:27:33.636 --> 00:27:34.637]  Go back to Upchuck Schumer.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.923]  So we're going to go after that, and that will help the average person lower their costs.
[00:27:39.923 --> 00:27:45.166]  And finally, we're going to have tomorrow a very novel idea of how to create 10 million jobs.
[00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:48.188]  There are 10 million Americans looking for good paying jobs.
[00:27:48.188 --> 00:27:49.829]  We're going to show them how to find them.
[00:27:49.829 --> 00:27:51.310]  And that's just the beginning.
[00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:58.614]  Week after week, month after month, we're going to roll out specific pieces here that are quite different than the Democratic Party you heard in the past.
[00:27:58.614 --> 00:27:59.955]  We were too cautious.
[00:27:59.955 --> 00:28:02.157]  We were too namby-pamby.
[00:28:02.157 --> 00:28:02.517]  This is sharp.
[00:28:02.517 --> 00:28:03.658]  Namby-pamby?
[00:28:04.498 --> 00:28:05.298]  Mamby Pamby?
[00:28:05.298 --> 00:28:06.079]  Hold on, hold on right there.
[00:28:06.079 --> 00:28:08.200]  You want to talk about Mamby Pamby?
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.221]  You want to talk about Mamby Pamby?
[00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:15.523]  Mamby Pamby is looking to the government or looking at Chuck Schumer for a job.
[00:28:15.523 --> 00:28:17.624]  Looking at the government, looking at Chuck Schumer.
[00:28:17.624 --> 00:28:19.145]  Please give me more money, please?
[00:28:20.185 --> 00:28:23.287]  Please make the bad Trump break up the big businesses.
[00:28:23.287 --> 00:28:25.388]  Make the bad Trump raise the minimum wage.
[00:28:25.388 --> 00:28:27.830]  Please make the bad Trump go after the drug companies.
[00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.651]  Please, it's the bad Trump.
[00:28:29.651 --> 00:28:30.812]  Please help me.
[00:28:30.812 --> 00:28:31.552]  Help me.
[00:28:31.552 --> 00:28:31.933]  No.
[00:28:31.933 --> 00:28:33.194]  You know what the answer is?
[00:28:33.194 --> 00:28:34.975]  Help your damn self!
[00:28:34.975 --> 00:28:36.976]  This is America!
[00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:38.837]  Up Chuck Schumer's telling you you're a victim.
[00:28:38.837 --> 00:28:39.798]  You can't do it.
[00:28:39.798 --> 00:28:40.879]  We're gonna help you.
[00:28:40.879 --> 00:28:41.859]  I'm Chuck Schumer.
[00:28:41.859 --> 00:28:42.940]  I'm gonna be the guy.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:48.864]  This guy's the dirtiest, crookedest, nastiest politician on the face of the earth you wouldn't buy a pastrami sandwich from if it was a deli man.
[00:28:50.003 --> 00:28:51.065]  Disgusting people!
[00:28:51.065 --> 00:28:53.670]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.795]  Up Chuck Schumer wants to be your daddy.
[00:28:57.543 --> 00:29:01.425]  Just 6% of Americans say the Russian collusion conspiracy theory is important.
[00:29:01.425 --> 00:29:15.993]  The Daily Wire pointed out that in a Bloomberg survey pulling Americans on what they feel is the most important issues concerning the Trump administration, 35% said healthcare, 13% said the economy, 11% said terrorism, and a measly 6% said President Trump's relationship with Russia was an important issue for them.
[00:29:15.993 --> 00:29:20.215]  Then why does the mainstream media spend so much time focusing on the Russian conspiracy theory?
[00:29:20.215 --> 00:29:20.635]  Simple.
[00:29:20.635 --> 00:29:25.978]  They want to undermine the Trump presidency to appease their bosses, the globalist owners of major news corporations.
[00:29:26.158 --> 00:29:32.463]  You see, the best forms of propaganda spread through deception, and the mainstream media role plays as objective journalists while pushing a globalist agenda.
[00:29:32.463 --> 00:29:33.423]  But don't take it from me.
[00:29:33.423 --> 00:29:35.865]  Just look at the Bloomberg article that accompanied the poll.
[00:29:35.865 --> 00:29:39.528]  Americans feel good about the economy, not so good about Trump, the headline read.
[00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:40.008]  Oh, really?
[00:29:40.008 --> 00:29:42.210]  The top three issues that Americans find important are
[00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.671]  They're the top issues that President Trump ran on during his campaign.
[00:29:44.671 --> 00:29:49.514]  The mainstream media hates Trump for bringing back Americana and the belief in national self-determination.
[00:29:49.514 --> 00:29:54.817]  And that's why they keep pushing the Russian collusion conspiracy theory, which CNN's Van Jones even admitted was a nothing burger.
[00:29:54.817 --> 00:29:57.078]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:04.214]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.

[00:31:26.925 --> 00:31:27.185]  Woo!

[00:31:28.206 --> 00:31:36.954]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[00:32:10.952 --> 00:32:14.794]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.

[00:32:39.234 --> 00:32:43.217]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and prone
[00:32:43.237 --> 00:32:44.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:21.116 --> 00:33:23.737]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:23.737 --> 00:33:28.418]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.418 --> 00:33:40.561]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to talk to you today about the basic survival, not just of Western society, but of the family and the human community itself.
[00:33:41.752 --> 00:33:48.714]  The technocrats, as the world's ruling elite call themselves, are incredibly selfish people.
[00:33:48.714 --> 00:33:59.217]  And they admit that they have a plan to balkanize nations and turn peoples against each other so they can be easily ruled via divide and conquer.
[00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:18.083]  But first the nation state itself must be taken over by private corporate combines and foreign groups then need to be brought in who are clothed and fed and brainwashed by the state to be destabilization forces.
[00:34:18.083 --> 00:34:20.464]  Now this is not my opinion.
[00:34:20.464 --> 00:34:27.066]  On screen is an article from 2012 from the BBC that's promoting world government
[00:34:28.442 --> 00:34:28.642]  I think?
[00:34:48.883 --> 00:34:53.245]  Systems that will not, quote, upset the Islamicist and others.
[00:34:53.245 --> 00:34:57.788]  And examples of this are in Germany, they tell women don't wear short skirts.
[00:34:57.788 --> 00:34:58.808]  It will make the Muslims mad.
[00:34:58.808 --> 00:35:03.711]  They're starting to not have outdoor Oktoberfest because the Muslims will attack people drinking beer.
[00:35:04.651 --> 00:35:08.334]  The Muslims are attacking people walking dogs, saying they're unclean.
[00:35:08.334 --> 00:35:18.321]  And now, in schools in the US, but also in Europe and places in Austria, they're banning pork in school lunches because Muslims are upset about it.
[00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:24.026]  Well, Orthodox Jews don't eat pork, but they don't then demand that the schools don't serve it.
[00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.352]  This is all about total and complete control.
[00:35:28.352 --> 00:35:37.117]  They're bringing in groups like Orthodox radical Muslims who won't even get along with each other in their own countries and have constant civil war.
[00:35:37.117 --> 00:35:46.802]  They are so cult-like and they admit that they're going to make Europe, the United States, Australia adopt authoritarian codes to quote
[00:35:48.311 --> 00:35:49.571]  Accommodate the Muslims.
[00:35:49.571 --> 00:35:52.913]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is how we're being culturally conquered.
[00:35:52.913 --> 00:35:58.454]  First, they get us to be open to the gays and then, you know, to be open to this group or that group.
[00:35:58.454 --> 00:36:04.256]  And then next they're saying we're going to teach your children about how to have sex when they're five years old and how to masturbate in schools.
[00:36:04.256 --> 00:36:07.197]  But we're going to bring in Muslims that throw gay people off buildings.
[00:36:07.197 --> 00:36:08.458]  And you're going to submit to them as well.
[00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:14.960]  But you're not going to give out Christmas cards, as we've seen cases around the country, at Christmas at school because of separation of church and state.
[00:36:15.851 --> 00:36:18.585]  Separation of church and state, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:19.821 --> 00:36:22.582]  Says that the government can't have an official religion.
[00:36:22.582 --> 00:36:25.163]  It doesn't mean you can't hand out Christmas cards.
[00:36:25.163 --> 00:36:35.586]  But only Christians, Libertarians, Conservatives, Nationalists, Free Market folks, a very diverse group, only we have to give up our speech and shut up.
[00:36:35.586 --> 00:36:45.210]  Well, here's a new article today that David Knight and Owen Shore are going to be breaking down a little bit later here on the live transmission from WorldNetDaily, simply pointing out a UN document from 2000
[00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:51.094]  Telling folks, oh we need to bring in the folks from Africa, we need to bring in the Muslims.
[00:36:51.094 --> 00:37:00.822]  Then they pay, the UN does, along with Peter Southerland, the UN, George Soros with our tax money, to bring the people 100 miles off the coast of international waters.
[00:37:00.822 --> 00:37:07.007]  Then the EU Navy comes and quote rescues them and brings them in to be resettled.
[00:37:07.007 --> 00:37:11.371]  And Italian homeowners and hotel owners are being thrown out
[00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:20.595]  Their guests are being thrown out and the islamicist 80 plus percent military age men being brought in are then put on welfare.
[00:37:20.595 --> 00:37:21.956]  This is the idea.
[00:37:21.956 --> 00:37:27.159]  This is the program and they say it is to quote replace Europeans.
[00:37:27.159 --> 00:37:38.725]  Then they teach in the news that white people are fundamentally evil and fundamentally bad and need to be gotten rid of and that white genocide is now taught in colleges.
[00:37:38.725 --> 00:37:39.125]  So again,
[00:37:40.677 --> 00:37:46.943]  The race-based Hitlerian plan, whether it's carried out by whites or carried out by others, is always very attractive.
[00:37:46.943 --> 00:37:49.845]  You read the Bible, different tribes are always exterminating each other.
[00:37:49.845 --> 00:37:52.168]  But the big mega-banks are coming in!
[00:37:54.099 --> 00:38:08.051]  With the 7 billion plus people, it'll be 9 billion in just a few years in the third world, and using them as weapons against the West after the globalists have already exploited the continent of Africa, exploited other areas.
[00:38:08.051 --> 00:38:14.696]  But they're not bringing in people in ultra-massive numbers from, say, Brazil or other areas that have more libertarian or conservative backgrounds.
[00:38:14.696 --> 00:38:20.020]  They're bringing people in out of savage Muslim countries where women are kept as animals.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.422]  Failed states like Somalia and Sudan.
[00:38:23.183 --> 00:38:27.407]  So, to counter this, I am announcing a $20,000 contest.
[00:38:27.407 --> 00:38:42.479]  Because the media made fun of the video that I put out a few months ago, and Super Deluxe turned it into a video that had 20 million views in the last week, where I sung about how they basically cover up.
[00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:51.666]  There's a massive cover up when Islamists in Europe rape, bomb, shoot, stab, run people over with cars.
[00:38:51.666 --> 00:38:52.106]  And so,
[00:38:53.712 --> 00:38:58.774]  I basically made a joke and said, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too.
[00:38:58.774 --> 00:38:59.955]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:38:59.955 --> 00:39:00.996]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:39:00.996 --> 00:39:06.838]  Because when somebody screams Allah Akbar and stabs people, whether it's in San Francisco, whether it's in Minneapolis, St.
[00:39:06.838 --> 00:39:13.822]  Paul, or whether it's in New York City, or somebody shoots a cop in the back of the head yelling Allah Akbar, national media won't report it.
[00:39:14.622 --> 00:39:19.523]  So we're going to expose the type of immigrants, the type of invaders, the types that are being brought in.
[00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:21.124]  That'll be clear.
[00:39:21.124 --> 00:39:22.264]  You can't go to Sudan.
[00:39:22.264 --> 00:39:23.344]  You can't go to Somalia.
[00:39:23.344 --> 00:39:25.985]  You can't go to Saudi Arabia and be a Christian.
[00:39:25.985 --> 00:39:28.645]  You can't be a woman and not wear a burka over your head.
[00:39:28.645 --> 00:39:32.746]  You can't be a woman and drive a car, go shopping without your mail controller.
[00:39:32.746 --> 00:39:34.647]  You can't be gay without being murdered.
[00:39:34.647 --> 00:39:43.989]  So standing up against these human rights abuses and standing up against this anti-Western tyranny, so to counter this sinister move by global government forces,
[00:39:44.269 --> 00:39:54.515]  To crush what's left of the last few free nations that exist using huge third world hordes of Islamists that have already been exploited and stirred up by the globalists.
[00:39:54.515 --> 00:40:01.899]  We're launching an epic contest where you can add news clips, your own commentary into remixes.
[00:40:03.118 --> 00:40:03.659]  I don't care.
[00:40:03.659 --> 00:40:05.240]  The more creative, the better.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:22.999]  But work into it the song that Time Warner and Super Deluxe thought would be so damaging to us in this meme war and expose the fact that the UN and others are pushing this massive agenda for us to have big open hearts and open ourselves up
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.462]  To more than just the 10 million Islamists that have already gone into Europe the last few years.
[00:40:28.462 --> 00:40:30.683]  Again, 80% of them military-age men.
[00:40:30.683 --> 00:40:37.465]  So InfoWars is announcing this anti-globalist, anti-open border contest.
[00:40:37.465 --> 00:40:38.986]  There are three prizes.
[00:40:38.986 --> 00:40:40.846]  Let's go over them.
[00:40:40.846 --> 00:40:52.631]  Wait till the globalists and all their minions, using our taxpayer money to propagandize our own destruction, face the power of the people resisting through information warfare, through truth.
[00:40:54.921 --> 00:40:57.823]  $10,000 is the main prize, best cover.
[00:40:57.823 --> 00:41:12.593]  Again, mix in clips, mix in remixes, mix in news, expose the globalist pedophile rings, expose the radical Islamic invasion, expose the whole UN program, mix it all together with the music performed by you or your band, $10,000.
[00:41:12.593 --> 00:41:15.195]  We just had a $20,000 winner in the CNN meme contest last week.
[00:41:19.538 --> 00:41:22.602]  Filmed from the best location, $5,000.
[00:41:22.602 --> 00:41:28.530]  And filmed with best audience participation, $5,000.
[00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.374]  That's three different winners.
[00:41:31.374 --> 00:41:34.458]  But so many people have entered the last meme contest, more than 8,000.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.040]  Didn't
[00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:52.305]  Don't
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:25.634]  You know, the Vatican and all the pedophilia exposed the Clintons and Jerry Epstein, exposed Weiner, exposed all their corruption, exposed the open borders, exposed the master plan, exposed how they cover up for Islamic terror and attacks and enslavement.
[00:42:25.634 --> 00:42:28.657]  And everybody that enters wins by spreading the word.
[00:42:28.657 --> 00:42:29.598]  They want to censor.
[00:42:29.598 --> 00:42:30.579]  They want to shut us up.
[00:42:30.579 --> 00:42:31.760]  They want to shut you up.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.782]  We're going to the next level.
[00:42:34.423 --> 00:42:35.585]  This is going to be exciting.
[00:42:35.585 --> 00:42:37.767]  I can't wait to see all your entries.
[00:42:37.767 --> 00:42:40.010]  I'm Alex Jones, counting on you.
[00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.692]  Because this is the InfoWar.
[00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:44.896]  And in the InfoWar, you are the resistance.
[00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:46.498]  You are the power.
[00:42:46.498 --> 00:42:50.363]  You are the force that can destroy these globalist parasites.
[00:42:59.156 --> 00:43:06.622]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:43:06.622 --> 00:43:19.851]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:43:20.772 --> 00:43:32.663]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:43:32.663 --> 00:43:38.628]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:48.398]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[00:43:48.398 --> 00:43:56.626]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:43:58.826 --> 00:44:00.708]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:02.730]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.512]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:44:05.512 --> 00:44:11.697]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:44:11.697 --> 00:44:19.064]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[00:44:19.204 --> 00:44:20.866]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:44:20.866 --> 00:44:28.414]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:44:28.414 --> 00:44:36.463]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:44:36.463 --> 00:44:37.544]  The general public doesn't.
[00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:42.553]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:44:42.553 --> 00:44:46.136]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:44:46.136 --> 00:44:52.841]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:44:52.841 --> 00:44:56.945]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4wrestore.com.
[00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:05.144]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:45:05.144 --> 00:45:18.091]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:24.655]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:27.136]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[00:45:27.196 --> 00:45:38.427]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[00:45:38.427 --> 00:45:40.769]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:45:40.769 --> 00:45:42.250]  We're getting results.
[00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:48.196]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:45:48.356 --> 00:45:51.240]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:59.331]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, AAA253-3139.
[00:45:59.331 --> 00:46:05.378]  Rediscover your fire with the EcoZoom Coal Rocket Camping Stove!
[00:46:05.999 --> 00:46:14.025]  It's easy to light, and you can cook with wood, charcoal, or any biomass fuel in a rugged and durable design.
[00:46:14.025 --> 00:46:17.167]  And that means big power in a portable package.
[00:46:17.167 --> 00:46:23.211]  The Versa cooks fast, it produces less smoke, and it's fuel efficient.
[00:46:23.211 --> 00:46:27.354]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.
[00:46:27.794 --> 00:46:33.836]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.
[00:46:33.836 --> 00:46:40.419]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal and you got yourself an entire meal.
[00:46:40.419 --> 00:46:42.120]  Now that looks good.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:54.984]  Go to Infowarsstore.com for more details and see how you can become the master outdoor chef and enjoy cooking freedom with the EcoZoom Versa Outdoor Stove.
[00:46:54.984 --> 00:46:55.925]  Available right now.
[00:46:56.525 --> 00:47:02.590]  At, you guessed it, InfowarsStore.com!
[00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:09.796]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:09.796 --> 00:47:15.821]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[00:47:15.821 --> 00:47:17.362]  Government is the problem.
[00:47:20.325 --> 00:47:28.048]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[00:47:28.048 --> 00:47:36.112]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[00:47:36.112 --> 00:47:38.233]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:41.134]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:47:42.828 --> 00:47:47.457]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones here today on a Sunday from the big studio.
[00:47:47.457 --> 00:47:51.103]  Great job by the crew getting us all set up and going in here despite being short-staffed.
[00:47:52.586 --> 00:47:57.830]  InfoWars.com, folks, another new product for you at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:04.776]  We have now added True Whey Protein to our great line of products at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:48:13.863 --> 00:48:14.484]  We're good to go.
[00:48:36.599 --> 00:48:40.305]  Really shocked when I actually enjoyed this protein.
[00:48:40.305 --> 00:48:46.014]  Another thing about it, you can see actually if you're watching the ad, it's the only protein I enjoy with water too.
[00:48:46.014 --> 00:48:48.738]  I've never had a protein that I enjoy with just water.
[00:48:48.738 --> 00:48:51.503]  I usually mix it with milk or something else in there.
[00:48:52.003 --> 00:48:55.726]  So, this is really an incredible product that we're bringing to you at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:48:55.726 --> 00:48:57.047]  True Whey Protein.
[00:48:57.047 --> 00:48:58.248]  Great with water.
[00:48:58.248 --> 00:48:59.409]  Great vanilla flavoring.
[00:48:59.409 --> 00:49:01.871]  And we've also got the Ultimate Protein Pack.
[00:49:01.871 --> 00:49:02.812]  25% off.
[00:49:02.812 --> 00:49:06.495]  Caveman combined with the new True Whey Protein.
[00:49:06.495 --> 00:49:08.097]  So go to InfoWarStore.com.
[00:49:08.097 --> 00:49:15.443]  Take advantage of those specials and all the specials that we have running right now.
[00:49:15.443 --> 00:49:18.686]  We're going to give out the phone number because we're going to take your calls in the second hour.
[00:49:19.867 --> 00:49:21.469]  So, whatever you'd like to call in on, 877-789-2539.
[00:49:21.469 --> 00:49:21.990]  877-789-2539.
[00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.470]  That's 877-789-Alex.
[00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:23.852]  Anything you'd like to call about.
[00:49:23.852 --> 00:49:25.474]  This was a story that... Now, where is it here?
[00:49:25.474 --> 00:49:25.774]  Here we go.
[00:49:37.934 --> 00:49:39.974]  First of all, this is just a nice little ditty.
[00:49:39.974 --> 00:49:44.696]  We'll just go ahead and mention this little ditty for you from RT.
[00:49:44.696 --> 00:49:46.036]  Handy way to pay.
[00:49:46.036 --> 00:49:46.376]  U.S.
[00:49:46.376 --> 00:49:50.317]  firm plans to fit employees with microchip implants.
[00:49:50.317 --> 00:49:50.677]  A U.S.
[00:49:50.677 --> 00:49:59.439]  vending business is entering a new era of convenience by implanting microchips in employees that will allow them to access to basic workplace amenities.
[00:49:59.439 --> 00:50:01.459]  Of course, where is this going on?
[00:50:01.459 --> 00:50:04.000]  Liberal, Wisconsin.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.960]  Got to love that.
[00:50:07.489 --> 00:50:09.291]  Folks, I'll tell you.
[00:50:09.291 --> 00:50:14.115]  You'll never see me getting a microchip implanted in me to buy something.
[00:50:14.115 --> 00:50:15.175]  Okay?
[00:50:15.175 --> 00:50:18.638]  I'll go ahead with straight cash, homie.
[00:50:18.638 --> 00:50:19.599]  I'll be just fine.
[00:50:19.599 --> 00:50:21.040]  No thanks on your microchip.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:27.946]  But they're going to try to make it... See, they're going to start making people put these into their bodies to get into doors for security reasons or health reasons.
[00:50:27.946 --> 00:50:31.389]  They'll come up with a dozen different ways to mark you with the beast.
[00:50:31.389 --> 00:50:33.290]  But here's the story that I really wanted to break down.
[00:50:34.051 --> 00:50:48.784]  Because this is so key to me, and from someone that actually has to deal with this on the front lines, it's like the Bon Iver cover of Alex Jones, when he's like, I deal with these people, I face these scum!
[00:50:48.784 --> 00:50:55.690]  Well yeah, and then Alex sends me out to face these scum too, and they're getting paid!
[00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:56.991]  Paid protesters!
[00:50:56.991 --> 00:50:58.052]  It reaches a new level!
[00:50:59.096 --> 00:51:07.063]  From Breitbart, Fight for the Future offers $15,000 for full-time anti-Trump activists.
[00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:08.985]  Have you ever heard of such a thing?
[00:51:08.985 --> 00:51:12.388]  It's not a protest when you're getting paid to do it.
[00:51:12.388 --> 00:51:18.893]  It's not a redress of grievances with the government when you're on salary.
[00:51:18.893 --> 00:51:22.016]  No, now that's your job.
[00:51:22.016 --> 00:51:24.659]  Here's a quote, terrified about Trump?
[00:51:25.643 --> 00:51:26.824]  Quit your job.
[00:51:26.824 --> 00:51:30.027]  Start an A-team.
[00:51:30.027 --> 00:51:32.909]  We might just fund it.
[00:51:32.909 --> 00:51:35.671]  Terrified about Trump.
[00:51:35.671 --> 00:51:39.074]  I mean, just look at this propaganda from the very beginning, folks.
[00:51:39.074 --> 00:51:45.179]  This is why this angers me so much because this is so targeted at the youth.
[00:51:45.179 --> 00:51:52.305]  This is such an attempt to brainwash the youth that it really sickens me.
[00:51:52.305 --> 00:51:53.607]  Terrified about Trump?
[00:51:54.665 --> 00:51:57.687]  As if there's some reason to be terrified about Trump.
[00:51:57.687 --> 00:52:03.892]  The only reason I could think of you being terrified about Trump is if you're some sicko pedophile in DC.
[00:52:03.892 --> 00:52:09.176]  Or maybe you're an illegal citizen here, raping people, murdering people.
[00:52:09.176 --> 00:52:11.778]  Then yeah, you might be terrified of Donald Trump.
[00:52:11.778 --> 00:52:13.459]  Maybe you're a corrupt politician.
[00:52:13.459 --> 00:52:15.441]  Then maybe Trump terrifies you.
[00:52:15.441 --> 00:52:19.764]  But they're acting like you, the average American, the average citizen.
[00:52:19.764 --> 00:52:21.485]  You should be terrified about Trump.
[00:52:21.485 --> 00:52:21.746]  In fact,
[00:52:22.546 --> 00:52:23.566]  Not that you should be.
[00:52:23.566 --> 00:52:26.187]  In fact, you are.
[00:52:26.187 --> 00:52:28.068]  You are terrified about Trump.
[00:52:28.068 --> 00:52:38.570]  And it's not because the mainstream media has been lying about him for over a year, going on two years plus now.
[00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:44.012]  And so they blame Trump because the media lies about him all day long.
[00:52:44.012 --> 00:52:44.812]  So there you go.
[00:52:44.812 --> 00:52:47.433]  So there's just one element of their propaganda.
[00:52:47.433 --> 00:52:48.193]  Then it goes on.
[00:52:48.193 --> 00:52:49.874]  Quit your job.
[00:52:49.874 --> 00:52:50.774]  Quit your job.
[00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:55.097]  Quit your job.
[00:52:55.097 --> 00:52:56.018]  Quit your job, folks.
[00:52:56.018 --> 00:53:01.862]  Just quit your job, pick up a street sign, and chant in the streets.
[00:53:01.862 --> 00:53:16.412]  So, Fight for the Future's A-Teams project page is now going to offer as much as $15,000 for the first month to political activism teams to fight a wide range of social and political issues listed on the website, including
[00:53:17.622 --> 00:53:29.975]  Healthcare, Affordable Care Act, Climate, Immigration, The Wall, Corruption, Racism, Fascism, Police, Prisons.
[00:53:29.975 --> 00:53:32.838]  So they tell you that you're terrified about Trump.
[00:53:32.838 --> 00:53:33.119]  Why?
[00:53:34.997 --> 00:53:36.418]  Because of health care.
[00:53:36.418 --> 00:53:38.100]  Their first reason, the Affordable Care Act.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:42.283]  So, it doesn't matter that Obamacare's failing.
[00:53:42.283 --> 00:53:45.726]  It doesn't matter that you don't have as many options as you used to have.
[00:53:45.726 --> 00:53:48.588]  Some counties where you only have one option, it's monopoly care.
[00:53:48.588 --> 00:53:51.050]  Some counties where you might not have any options now.
[00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:56.734]  It doesn't matter that premiums are skyrocketing, deductibles skyrocketing, and options being limited, so price is going up.
[00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:58.656]  That's how monopolies work.
[00:53:58.656 --> 00:53:59.817]  You're scared of Trump!
[00:54:01.308 --> 00:54:08.293]  You see, you're scared of Trump because he's going after that health care bill that's so great that they lied to you about.
[00:54:08.293 --> 00:54:08.974]  Climate.
[00:54:08.974 --> 00:54:11.976]  And so they always... See, they have these little buzzwords.
[00:54:11.976 --> 00:54:13.457]  This is how they brainwash you.
[00:54:13.457 --> 00:54:15.599]  They lie to you about climate change.
[00:54:15.599 --> 00:54:17.680]  They lie to you about the Affordable Care Act.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.282]  They lie to you about immigration.
[00:54:19.282 --> 00:54:20.723]  They lie to you about racism.
[00:54:20.723 --> 00:54:22.104]  They lie to you about everything.
[00:54:22.104 --> 00:54:29.990]  Then when somebody comes along like Trump or Alex Jones, or it could be anyone, when someone comes along and tells you the truth,
[00:54:31.889 --> 00:54:46.359]  When someone has the nerve to actually tell you the truth, to stand up in a world of lies, a world of deceit, and tell you the truth, you must be terrified.
[00:54:46.359 --> 00:54:51.102]  You have to quit your job.
[00:54:51.102 --> 00:54:55.025]  You have to start the A-Team.
[00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:57.687]  And we will fund it.
[00:55:01.707 --> 00:55:06.892]  So it's not a protest when it's your job.
[00:55:06.892 --> 00:55:13.399]  You're not terrified about Trump when you've been lied to about him.
[00:55:13.399 --> 00:55:19.185]  And we've already seen these people that are going to sign up for this type of crap.
[00:55:19.185 --> 00:55:22.348]  And it will equal nothing.
[00:55:22.348 --> 00:55:24.250]  And just like every other time,
[00:55:25.148 --> 00:55:44.462]  When I hit the streets and I asked these Trump protesters what they're out here doing, why they don't like Trump, what he said that's racist, what he's done that's misogynist, what do they know about the Paris Climate Accord, what do you know about healthcare, what do you actually know about any of this stuff?
[00:55:44.462 --> 00:55:46.804]  They have nothing.
[00:55:46.804 --> 00:55:52.448]  And they will continue to have nothing except now they might have a couple thousand bucks to play around with.
[00:55:58.004 --> 00:55:58.964]  And it just goes on.
[00:55:58.964 --> 00:56:00.425]  It tells them how they can organize.
[00:56:00.425 --> 00:56:08.128]  It tells them that they need to hook up with people that are like-minded and go out and be active and do all this.
[00:56:08.128 --> 00:56:24.235]  And they have enough brainwashed Stockholm Syndrome victims, thanks to liberal education, liberal media, that they will actually get people to sign up and go out on the streets and do all of it.
[00:56:24.235 --> 00:56:27.136]  And George Soros is the man behind the curtain.
[00:56:28.164 --> 00:56:31.546]  As usual.
[00:56:31.546 --> 00:56:35.067]  So, think about this.
[00:56:35.067 --> 00:56:46.893]  You've got Democrats spending hundreds of millions of dollars on failed elections, not just Hillary Clinton, but in the special elections going all out.
[00:56:46.893 --> 00:56:50.775]  So now you've got the DNC, this is from the Daily Caller,
[00:56:52.262 --> 00:56:59.564]  DNC finished last month $3.3 million in debt.
[00:56:59.564 --> 00:57:07.326]  The Democratic National Committee is struggling to win elections and now it's $3.3 million in debt.
[00:57:07.326 --> 00:57:15.648]  The DNC raised just $5.5 million over the June fundraising period and outspent themselves by $200,000, finishing the month with $3.3 million in debt.
[00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:26.495]  You know who we heard from in the first hour?
[00:57:26.495 --> 00:57:33.319]  Upchuck Schumer, who told you that the Democrats were going to be your saviors on the economy.
[00:57:33.319 --> 00:57:34.640]  Here's the DNC.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.081]  The DNC has been sued.
[00:57:36.081 --> 00:57:38.242]  The DNC is being sued right now.
[00:57:38.242 --> 00:57:40.424]  Bernie Sanders' wife is being investigated.
[00:57:40.424 --> 00:57:42.805]  The DNC's in debt $3.3 million.
[00:57:42.805 --> 00:57:45.667]  And Upchuck Schumer wants to be your daddy.
[00:57:45.667 --> 00:57:47.308]  He wants to be in charge of the economy.
[00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:53.553]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:57:53.553 --> 00:58:01.298]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:58:01.298 --> 00:58:09.883]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:58:09.883 --> 00:58:14.326]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:58:14.326 --> 00:58:19.630]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:20.750]  We're good to go.
[00:58:49.417 --> 00:58:55.965]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:58:55.965 --> 00:59:08.740]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.581]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:59:12.581 --> 00:59:19.564]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:59:19.564 --> 00:59:32.428]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:59:32.428 --> 00:59:33.989]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:59:34.269 --> 00:59:40.676]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:59:40.676 --> 00:59:44.840]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.402]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.962 --> 01:00:07.584]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.584 --> 01:00:12.485]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.485 --> 01:00:20.347]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex Jones here on this Sunday, according to Rasmussen polls, that have been around for a long time.
[01:00:21.607 --> 01:00:28.794]  In the entire history of Rasmussen polls, Americans have never polled happier than they have.
[01:00:28.794 --> 01:00:32.077]  74% say they are very happy.
[01:00:32.077 --> 01:00:34.399]  Their rate of life is good or excellent.
[01:00:34.399 --> 01:00:38.563]  That's the highest rating in the history of Rasmussen polls.
[01:00:38.563 --> 01:00:41.225]  But Trump isn't making America great again, folks.
[01:00:41.225 --> 01:00:42.086]  He's failing.
[01:00:42.086 --> 01:00:43.227]  Yes, I'm sure.
[01:00:43.227 --> 01:00:45.269]  And it's the Democrats with Upchuck Schumer.
[01:00:46.482 --> 01:00:55.228]  That can't win an election, can't fundraise, can't put together a coherent plan, can't do anything that is going to be the savior.
[01:00:55.228 --> 01:00:58.811]  No, they're going to continue to fall flat on their face, and you, the audience, knows it.
[01:00:58.811 --> 01:01:00.932]  Let's go out to the audience with some phone calls.
[01:01:00.932 --> 01:01:03.955]  We're going to be taking your phone calls here in the second hour.
[01:01:03.955 --> 01:01:07.137]  Again, that phone line is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:01:07.137 --> 01:01:08.918]  Let's start with Lance in Texas.
[01:01:08.918 --> 01:01:11.040]  Go ahead, Lance.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.801]  Hey, wow.
[01:01:12.801 --> 01:01:14.802]  Number one, huh?
[01:01:14.802 --> 01:01:15.303]  Lead us off.
[01:01:16.933 --> 01:01:20.577]  Um, the world is collectively insane, Owen.
[01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:23.159]  Yeah.
[01:01:23.159 --> 01:01:26.982]  They pay taxes.
[01:01:26.982 --> 01:01:30.105]  They fund abortions.
[01:01:30.105 --> 01:01:36.791]  They fund the murder of women and children they never met.
[01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:38.973]  They don't give a damn.
[01:01:38.973 --> 01:01:39.614]  It's true.
[01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:42.076]  They just go about their lives like
[01:01:43.306 --> 01:01:44.627]  Nothing happened.
[01:01:44.627 --> 01:01:47.929]  Like, they didn't have a part in it.
[01:01:47.929 --> 01:01:50.911]  Well, I mean, Lance, I mean, you know, hey, now hold on a second, Lance.
[01:01:50.911 --> 01:01:53.613]  I mean, we got, you know, the new Kardashians are on at 7 p.m.
[01:01:53.613 --> 01:01:54.013]  Eastern.
[01:01:54.013 --> 01:01:56.215]  So, you know, come on.
[01:01:56.215 --> 01:01:58.216]  Well, I wouldn't know.
[01:01:58.216 --> 01:01:59.377]  Come on, Lance.
[01:01:59.377 --> 01:02:01.278]  Come on, Lance.
[01:02:01.278 --> 01:02:02.159]  I don't care.
[01:02:02.159 --> 01:02:07.983]  I don't care that there's, I don't care that pedophile rings have been involved in the Catholic Church and the United States government.
[01:02:07.983 --> 01:02:09.444]  I don't care about that.
[01:02:09.444 --> 01:02:11.045]  I just want the Kardashians.
[01:02:12.506 --> 01:02:22.412]  I moved out to the middle of nowhere, East Texas, nine years ago, not expecting anything, just helping my family out.
[01:02:22.412 --> 01:02:25.574]  Country boy can't survive.
[01:02:25.574 --> 01:02:36.421]  Well, what I found out was, it's a lot more efficient to raise your own animals, raise your own... Grow your own garden?
[01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:37.602]  Yeah, I got a huge garden.
[01:02:38.211 --> 01:02:44.195]  Yeah, you probably, honestly, you probably, most of the people I know that end up gardening and have big gardens end up having too much produce.
[01:02:44.195 --> 01:02:46.536]  They give a lot of it away.
[01:02:46.536 --> 01:02:53.741]  Yeah, and we give a lot of eggs away because I got way too many chickens, I got turkeys, I got guineas.
[01:02:53.741 --> 01:02:54.962]  I got everything out here.
[01:02:54.962 --> 01:02:58.204]  So the world's going insane, I would agree with that.
[01:02:58.204 --> 01:03:00.865]  The liberal brainwashed, you know what though, here's an interesting point though.
[01:03:00.865 --> 01:03:02.907]  Here's an interesting point that I actually want to make on that.
[01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:07.393]  Because I do agree with you for the most part.
[01:03:07.393 --> 01:03:10.854]  Liberalism has become a mental disorder.
[01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:13.116]  It's only in the modern day construct.
[01:03:13.116 --> 01:03:19.279]  Because true liberalism, there's a whole historical construct of liberalism and then there's a whole modern day liberalism.
[01:03:19.279 --> 01:03:21.840]  But the audience understands what I'm getting at.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:30.024]  But here's the key thing to me that I think is just a universal fact.
[01:03:30.024 --> 01:03:31.645]  At least from my observation.
[01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:34.377]  And it kind of goes along with what you're saying.
[01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:36.078]  Yes, the world is insane.
[01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:38.339]  Yes, people have been brainwashed.
[01:03:38.339 --> 01:03:42.501]  Yes, people have been fluoridated into complete capitulation.
[01:03:42.501 --> 01:03:43.541]  This is all going on.
[01:03:43.541 --> 01:03:46.663]  I have even, in fact, fallen victim to it.
[01:03:46.663 --> 01:03:48.003]  But here's the key.
[01:03:48.003 --> 01:03:48.544]  Here's the key.
[01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.552]  Where is a group of people?
[01:03:52.552 --> 01:03:53.973]  Show me the group of people.
[01:03:53.973 --> 01:03:55.535]  Show me the movement.
[01:03:55.535 --> 01:04:01.359]  Show me the momentum for people that are leaving the Republican Party and becoming Democrats.
[01:04:01.359 --> 01:04:03.201]  Show me the movement of people that are
[01:04:04.642 --> 01:04:07.385]  Going from the red pill to the blue pill.
[01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:08.867]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:04:08.867 --> 01:04:19.619]  So, even though there's still mass Stockholm Syndrome, even though there's still mass brainwashing, even though there's still this mass hypnosis that the general population is in,
[01:04:21.616 --> 01:04:23.297]  There is hope for them.
[01:04:23.297 --> 01:04:25.099]  They can be woke.
[01:04:25.099 --> 01:04:26.620]  They can be red-pilled.
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.302]  They can become a patriot.
[01:04:28.302 --> 01:04:29.783]  They can become a freedom fighter.
[01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:31.024]  They can live in reality.
[01:04:31.024 --> 01:04:32.285]  There is hope for these people.
[01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:34.147]  They can come back to reality.
[01:04:34.147 --> 01:04:37.390]  But on the other side of the spectrum, I don't see it going the other way.
[01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:41.344]  I don't see people on our side of the fence.
[01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:44.046]  I don't see our people going to Maxine Waters.
[01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:46.868]  I don't see any Trump supporter going to up Chuck Schumer.
[01:04:46.868 --> 01:04:48.289]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:53.153]  So even though the world is collectively insane, there is hope for them to come around.
[01:04:53.153 --> 01:04:55.975]  And then once they come around, they're never going back.
[01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:57.276]  We'll be right back with more Your Calls.
[01:04:59.867 --> 01:05:05.930]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:07.450]  The contest is simple.
[01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:12.693]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[01:05:12.693 --> 01:05:20.076]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[01:05:20.236 --> 01:05:26.902]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:36.971]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:44.518]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[01:05:44.718 --> 01:05:54.813]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[01:05:54.813 --> 01:05:58.158]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[01:05:58.158 --> 01:05:59.120]  This is Kit Daniels.
[01:06:07.692 --> 01:06:14.654]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:14.654 --> 01:06:19.615]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:19.615 --> 01:06:29.097]  Well, people have been telling you about this for a long time, and it's really just history repeating itself, except now you have the wind of George Soros, or whatever's left of him.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.161]  Forcing this.
[01:06:32.161 --> 01:06:38.628]  The Hungarian PM... Actually, let's start with the story from Associated Press.
[01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:44.614]  Hungary's leader, EU and Soros, seek to Muslimize Europe.
[01:06:44.614 --> 01:06:50.799]  European Union leaders and Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros are seeking a new mixed Muslimized culture.
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:55.104]  Hungary's anti-migration prime minister said Saturday.
[01:06:55.104 --> 01:06:59.209]  They have to throw that anti-migration in there, they can't just say prime minister.
[01:06:59.209 --> 01:07:12.083]  They gotta always have a little liberal jab, always have a little, you know, a little sieve, just to poke you a little bit, just to discredit you when they try to cover you.
[01:07:13.598 --> 01:07:17.421]  And then Pamela Geller picked it up today and went with the story.
[01:07:17.421 --> 01:07:27.367]  But a lot of people have been talking about this for a long time, the overarching agenda in the Middle East, the clash of civilization, the multiculturalism.
[01:07:27.367 --> 01:07:31.670]  And so you've seen what's happening, you know George Soros is behind it.
[01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:37.955]  But there was another interesting story that I saw, and David Knight covered that last week, but then there was another weird angle that I saw.
[01:07:38.823 --> 01:07:45.630]  This is a story that came out of the Associated Press and then got picked up by Yahoo.
[01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:48.994]  Despairing young Italians seek greener pastures abroad.
[01:07:50.177 --> 01:07:56.762]  Now, there's been a lot of news coming out of Italy, how the migration problem has reached unprecedented levels.
[01:07:56.762 --> 01:07:59.385]  They have so many boats coming in filled with these migrants.
[01:07:59.385 --> 01:08:03.348]  They get to the port and they can't, they don't even have room at these super ports.
[01:08:03.348 --> 01:08:05.990]  Now they're trying to get more ports to bring them in.
[01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:07.992]  Now they're actually trying to slow it down.
[01:08:07.992 --> 01:08:09.112]  So they know that's going on.
[01:08:09.112 --> 01:08:11.114]  They can't find a job.
[01:08:11.114 --> 01:08:12.936]  Italians are getting sick of it.
[01:08:12.936 --> 01:08:15.538]  You know, Italians, you know, they don't like getting pushed around.
[01:08:16.937 --> 01:08:28.859]  But the strange thing I found about this story was that when I went back to the AFP to read it, they had pulled the story.
[01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:35.701]  So the original source of the story has pulled the story, but Yahoo hasn't pulled it yet.
[01:08:35.701 --> 01:08:37.141]  So it's still on Yahoo.
[01:08:37.141 --> 01:08:42.002]  And you know, you know exactly what happened, folks.
[01:08:42.002 --> 01:08:45.103]  The editor said, we can't run that headline.
[01:08:46.457 --> 01:08:47.778]  Italy's great!
[01:08:47.778 --> 01:08:49.358]  Nobody wants to leave Italy!
[01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:51.399]  Multiculturalism is winning!
[01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:52.500]  Open borders are winning!
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.121]  All mass migration is winning!
[01:08:55.121 --> 01:08:56.642]  There's no cause for concern!
[01:08:56.642 --> 01:08:57.682]  Everybody loves Italy!
[01:08:57.682 --> 01:08:58.643]  Nobody's leaving!
[01:08:58.643 --> 01:09:00.563]  We can't run that story!
[01:09:00.563 --> 01:09:02.464]  So they deleted it.
[01:09:02.464 --> 01:09:04.385]  But, miscommunication.
[01:09:04.385 --> 01:09:15.030]  Yahoo still has the story up, so you can still read it if you want to hear about this story and why Italians are struggling to make ends meet, find a life for themselves, and why they want to leave.
[01:09:16.343 --> 01:09:20.805]  But if you're the Associated Free Press, well, we're just gonna go ahead and have to pull that.
[01:09:20.805 --> 01:09:23.386]  That's not politically correct enough for us.
[01:09:23.386 --> 01:09:25.567]  Let's go to Judy, who wants to talk about economy.
[01:09:25.567 --> 01:09:26.808]  Judy's in Florida.
[01:09:26.808 --> 01:09:27.448]  Go ahead, Judy.
[01:09:27.448 --> 01:09:29.389]  Hey, Owen.
[01:09:29.389 --> 01:09:32.170]  I think you're doing a great job.
[01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:34.672]  I really like listening to you.
[01:09:34.672 --> 01:09:39.034]  You just diverted my attention away from the original topic.
[01:09:39.034 --> 01:09:40.594]  I'll give it a segue, though.
[01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:46.017]  This is called white flight, what you are describing.
[01:09:46.785 --> 01:09:50.947]  In the AP article that has been pulled, what's happening in Italy.
[01:09:50.947 --> 01:09:53.548]  You said it was called white?
[01:09:53.548 --> 01:09:56.049]  I'm sorry, you said it was called white flight?
[01:09:56.049 --> 01:09:56.830]  Yes.
[01:09:56.830 --> 01:10:01.552]  Essentially, whites are being displaced at this point.
[01:10:01.552 --> 01:10:12.617]  I just got a statistic earlier today that where London was 90% white 70 years ago, is now only 40% white.
[01:10:12.617 --> 01:10:15.218]  And that's from Tara McCarthy, who is a Londonder.
[01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:20.812]  That is actually looking to immigrate and stay in the United States.
[01:10:20.812 --> 01:10:28.274]  But be that as it may, I mean, that's just something that is going to be a natural occurrence because of all the cultural enrichment.
[01:10:28.274 --> 01:10:30.195]  Yes.
[01:10:30.195 --> 01:10:31.075]  Yeah.
[01:10:31.075 --> 01:10:33.936]  I mean, I love this cultural enrichment.
[01:10:33.936 --> 01:10:36.177]  We love our Somalis.
[01:10:36.177 --> 01:10:38.398]  We love our cultural enrichment.
[01:10:38.398 --> 01:10:39.598]  Right in the knife in our back.
[01:10:41.557 --> 01:10:42.437]  You got that right.
[01:10:42.437 --> 01:10:57.303]  What I was going to say about the economy is just, I was listening to Catherine Austin Fitz talk to Greg Hunter recently, and anybody can look up that talk, and I think it's really important what they were saying with each other.
[01:10:57.303 --> 01:11:10.249]  Essentially, I think we need to hold Trump's feet to the fire in that he's going to do a wonderful job with our military, and I believe that military spending is important for our nation.
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:30.410]  We need to ensure that what has been stolen from us through like banker bailouts and what have you, we do reclaim legally because that was done illegally in order to have those... Are you talking about the Obama bailouts?
[01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:31.131]  Yeah, essentially.
[01:11:32.703 --> 01:11:37.047]  But what needs to be injected back into our... No, you know what?
[01:11:37.047 --> 01:11:43.332]  Actually, you actually raised a very unique point that I've never heard anyone raise before.
[01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:56.583]  And that is, looking at some of the things Obama did, you could say the Iran deal, and Trump is actually going, it looks like Trump is going to go ahead and certify that Iran deal, something he said he wouldn't, something he said was a bad thing.
[01:11:57.586 --> 01:12:00.628]  So, okay, you can raise an issue with that.
[01:12:00.628 --> 01:12:02.389]  But, you know, that's a good point.
[01:12:02.389 --> 01:12:04.090]  You talk about the banker bailouts.
[01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:07.551]  You talk about all these bailouts that Obama has had.
[01:12:07.551 --> 01:12:12.314]  You talk about bailing out Obamacare with Freddie and Fannie.
[01:12:12.314 --> 01:12:13.215]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:13.215 --> 01:12:14.595]  So, yeah, that's an interesting point.
[01:12:14.595 --> 01:12:15.756]  It's never really been raised.
[01:12:15.756 --> 01:12:18.658]  I've never heard anyone raise it.
[01:12:18.658 --> 01:12:19.138]  Here's the thing.
[01:12:19.138 --> 01:12:21.039]  I'm not just trying to play apologist for Trump.
[01:12:21.039 --> 01:12:22.420]  I'm just trying to deal with reality here.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.361]  Trump's got so many different things going on.
[01:12:25.361 --> 01:12:32.685]  I mean, my gosh, I can barely even manage, like, if I've got three stories I'm working on and, like, three different guests I'm trying, like, I can even barely manage that.
[01:12:32.685 --> 01:12:34.726]  I can't even imagine what Trump is dealing with.
[01:12:34.726 --> 01:12:39.869]  I mean, sleeps six hours a day or whatever and deals with thousands of people around the world at the same time.
[01:12:39.869 --> 01:12:41.910]  So I don't even know if that's anything that's on his radar.
[01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:44.571]  But that's an interesting point, especially with the banker bailout.
[01:12:44.571 --> 01:12:44.852]  I mean, that...
[01:12:45.632 --> 01:12:47.272]  I mean, my goodness.
[01:12:47.272 --> 01:12:52.654]  And these people want to complain all day about getting more money to the people out there that have been disenfranchised.
[01:12:52.654 --> 01:12:53.694]  What a bunch of frauds.
[01:12:53.694 --> 01:12:55.614]  Anything else, Judy?
[01:12:55.614 --> 01:12:58.755]  Well, I mean, I'm in agreement with what you're saying.
[01:12:58.755 --> 01:13:00.075]  I absolutely love Trump.
[01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:01.696]  I 100% support him.
[01:13:01.696 --> 01:13:08.417]  I don't know how he's getting anything done under the type of pressure and then just the lies in the media.
[01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.298]  Yeah, the constant attack on him and his family.
[01:13:11.331 --> 01:13:13.473]  Yeah, and I'm tired of being a Russian, okay?
[01:13:13.473 --> 01:13:14.654]  I'm not a Russki.
[01:13:14.654 --> 01:13:16.216]  Do you like my Russian tag?
[01:13:16.216 --> 01:13:23.724]  Look at my Russian, look at my Russian flag tie, and my Russian flag lapel, and the Russian Kremlin office behind me.
[01:13:23.724 --> 01:13:26.747]  Wait a second, what's that, Putin?
[01:13:26.747 --> 01:13:28.429]  Oh, two scoops?
[01:13:28.429 --> 01:13:29.790]  I get three scoops today, Putin.
[01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:32.693]  Putin says I get three scoops of ice cream today, wow.
[01:13:32.693 --> 01:13:33.834]  Good boy.
[01:13:35.145 --> 01:13:44.260]  But no, it's ridiculous as to the pressure he is under, but I think he's doing a wonderful job so far, but the economy...
[01:13:45.186 --> 01:13:48.449]  It's really what's most important to me besides the Muslim invasion.
[01:13:48.449 --> 01:13:50.110]  Well, here's the thing with the economy to me.
[01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:52.151]  Here's the thing with the economy to me.
[01:13:52.151 --> 01:13:59.837]  As long as Trump can get taxes lowered and keep bringing jobs in, I think that the economy will somewhat take care of itself.
[01:13:59.837 --> 01:14:06.221]  Just because Americans will have an income, they'll have a working income, they can start to buy some nice things that can help grow the economy.
[01:14:06.221 --> 01:14:07.922]  They can, you know, now they can have a family.
[01:14:07.922 --> 01:14:09.844]  They don't have to be worried about not being able to afford that.
[01:14:09.844 --> 01:14:12.445]  So, I think that's kind of the way that Trump views
[01:14:13.422 --> 01:14:13.962]  Cuckslayer, what's up?
[01:14:40.953 --> 01:14:42.894]  I actually met you at Bilderberg this year.
[01:14:42.894 --> 01:14:47.478]  I want everybody to know that the InfoWars guys are good guys in real life.
[01:14:47.478 --> 01:14:48.658]  Yeah, that was great.
[01:14:48.658 --> 01:14:53.782]  I was really happy to see the support we got out there at Bilderberg.
[01:14:53.782 --> 01:15:01.767]  Anyway, I do independent research and there's a lot of key information I've been coming across lately and I'm having trouble getting it out there.
[01:15:01.767 --> 01:15:08.352]  My YouTube videos usually only get a couple hundred views and my Twitter has been like crazy censored the past few weeks.
[01:15:09.199 --> 01:15:12.440]  Um, so I just wanted to call in and get some of this info out.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.721]  You got 30 seconds.
[01:15:14.721 --> 01:15:27.926]  Um, so first off, Obama's Twitter account, he has six, he is following 629,000 people that, um, majority of them are locked accounts with only one to three followers.
[01:15:27.926 --> 01:15:30.187]  One of them being the former president.
[01:15:30.187 --> 01:15:33.889]  Sounds like a key state, uh, communication network to me.
[01:15:34.657 --> 01:15:41.340]  Alright, I'll tell you what, let's hold Dan over because I've noticed some weirdness about Twitter too and there has been some strange stuff with that.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:47.323]  So we'll hold Dan over, we'll see, we'll try to get a more clear point as to what he's talking about.
[01:15:47.323 --> 01:15:52.666]  But there's no doubt, I mean, Twitter, Google, they all are censoring their results that you see.
[01:15:52.666 --> 01:15:54.446]  They want to control the optics, folks.
[01:15:54.446 --> 01:15:55.747]  They want to control the Overton window.
[01:15:55.747 --> 01:15:57.368]  We'll be right back with more of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:59.136 --> 01:16:04.798]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:16:04.798 --> 01:16:13.442]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[01:16:13.442 --> 01:16:21.345]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[01:16:21.345 --> 01:16:27.488]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[01:16:27.848 --> 01:16:30.890]  NAR Lipoic Acid, Bio PQQ and many others.
[01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:35.592]  Bio PQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:39.374]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[01:16:39.374 --> 01:16:42.075]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[01:16:42.075 --> 01:16:50.219]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party certified review agency, Power Review.
[01:16:50.219 --> 01:16:55.782]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com before it sells out again.

[01:16:59.102 --> 01:17:08.187]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:17:08.187 --> 01:17:16.291]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:17:16.571 --> 01:17:21.453]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:17:21.453 --> 01:17:28.236]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:17:28.236 --> 01:17:35.418]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:17:35.418 --> 01:17:42.281]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:17:42.441 --> 01:17:46.923]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:50.304]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:08.850]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.071]  A 360 win.

[01:18:16.636 --> 01:18:24.162]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:18:24.542 --> 01:18:29.226]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:35.732]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:18:35.732 --> 01:18:43.519]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:50.725]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:51.546]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:19:00.492 --> 01:19:11.079]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.920]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:16.002]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:19:16.002 --> 01:19:17.483]  It's made in the USA.
[01:19:17.483 --> 01:19:24.309]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:19:24.309 --> 01:19:26.410]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:30.193]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now
[01:19:30.213 --> 01:19:36.095]  Now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:19:36.095 --> 01:19:52.919]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:19:52.919 --> 01:19:56.200]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.521]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field and InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:04.930]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:29.554]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:20:29.554 --> 01:20:37.099]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:37.099 --> 01:20:39.720]  This is what we have to avoid in the future here, folks.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.984]  Now this is a story that Dinesh D'Souza just shared, but it's from 2011.
[01:20:44.984 --> 01:20:49.947]  Claire McCaskill, a Democrat Senator from Missouri, a witch of a woman, hates men.
[01:20:51.536 --> 01:20:55.481]  McCaskill to pay back taxes on plane.
[01:20:55.481 --> 01:21:06.236]  Senator Claire McCaskill, who has said that men just need to shut up, said Monday she will sell, this is again from 2011, said she will sell her private plane and pay $287,000 in four years of back taxes.
[01:21:10.051 --> 01:21:17.355]  So it's nice that this Democrat Senator has that lucrative cash just sitting around, just chilling, just sitting around.
[01:21:17.355 --> 01:21:24.800]  Senator McClaskill, she's just got this cash ready to go from back taxes, just like most of these Democrats.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:29.823]  And the story goes on and it talks about this plane and how they avoided taxes on this plane.
[01:21:29.823 --> 01:21:36.127]  And then all the money that was shelled out by the state of Missouri for her to go on these vacations to the tune of more than
[01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:41.630]  Half a million dollars, so she really owes the state of Missouri more than just those back taxes.
[01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:45.192]  But then, of course, leave it to Claire McCaskill to blame her husband.
[01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:46.993]  It was all her husband's fault.
[01:21:46.993 --> 01:21:48.693]  She wanted nothing to do with it.
[01:21:48.693 --> 01:21:50.354]  She didn't know what was going on.
[01:21:50.354 --> 01:21:53.096]  And then she convinced her husband.
[01:21:53.096 --> 01:21:57.618]  I have convinced my husband to sell the damn plane!
[01:21:57.618 --> 01:22:00.120]  McCaskill said after telling him to shut up, probably.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.281]  I will never set foot on the... So, but here's the story, guys.
[01:22:03.223 --> 01:22:04.604]  This happened in 2011.
[01:22:04.604 --> 01:22:07.425]  Claire McCaskill has been elected again!
[01:22:07.425 --> 01:22:12.847]  She has been elected since this story broke!
[01:22:12.847 --> 01:22:18.430]  Folks, it's time to stop electing crooked politicians.
[01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:19.410]  Okay?
[01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:21.751]  It's time to stop.
[01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:29.175]  It is time to hold yourself accountable as a member of the voting community of this republic!
[01:22:29.175 --> 01:22:31.696]  How can you vote for Claire McCaskill again?
[01:22:34.076 --> 01:22:35.876]  How can you vote for Paul Ryan?
[01:22:35.876 --> 01:22:37.317]  How can you vote?
[01:22:37.317 --> 01:22:42.678]  I mean, Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer, I mean the list goes on and on and on.
[01:22:42.678 --> 01:22:57.081]  I am just hoping, I am praying every night that in 2018 America wakes up and we finally make Congress great again and we do the right thing in this election just like we did electing Trump instead of this wicked witch of the West.
[01:22:59.127 --> 01:22:59.908]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:00.948]  Let's let Dan.
[01:23:00.948 --> 01:23:05.111]  Dan, finish your point on Obama Twitter weirdness and we got to get to some more calls.
[01:23:05.111 --> 01:23:06.932]  Go ahead, Dan.
[01:23:06.932 --> 01:23:07.192]  Sure.
[01:23:07.192 --> 01:23:09.594]  Well, so I was looking at Obama's Twitter account.
[01:23:09.594 --> 01:23:24.283]  He followed 629,000 people and the majority of them are random locked accounts that you can't view publicly that only have like one, two or three followers.
[01:23:24.283 --> 01:23:25.984]  One of them being Obama.
[01:23:26.491 --> 01:23:31.654]  I just, it seems like some sort of deep state communication network.
[01:23:31.654 --> 01:23:37.057]  Also, you were talking about the paid protesters earlier.
[01:23:37.057 --> 01:23:43.261]  Through my research, I've found that most of these stem from a group called Fund for the Public Interest.
[01:23:43.261 --> 01:23:48.684]  One of the heads of this group is a man named Adam Rothfeld, which is a very interesting last name, right?
[01:23:48.684 --> 01:23:52.206]  Anyway, his only other job was working for an art gallery.
[01:23:52.617 --> 01:24:06.290]  And the owner of that art gallery sits on a political board with none other than Chucky Crocodile Pierce Schumer, who we have seen dining and drinking on multiple occasions recently with Alex Soros.
[01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:12.015]  Oh yeah, Soros is big time hamming it up with these big, big Democrats up there.
[01:24:12.015 --> 01:24:14.097]  Was it the same type of art that Tony Podesta's into?
[01:24:16.445 --> 01:24:20.947]  I didn't look that far into it, but that's actually... I am going to look into that now.
[01:24:20.947 --> 01:24:22.127]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:22.127 --> 01:24:23.888]  And then tweet it at me.
[01:24:23.888 --> 01:24:26.209]  I mean, you can be into whatever art you want, Tony Podesta.
[01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:29.590]  I don't care if you're into art with young children's hands tied behind their backs.
[01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:31.771]  I mean, that's Tony Podesta's art choice.
[01:24:31.771 --> 01:24:37.513]  I mean, you know, he has every right to have weird art that depicts children being in weird, torturous positions.
[01:24:37.513 --> 01:24:39.194]  That's what Tony Podesta likes, not me.
[01:24:39.194 --> 01:24:40.195]  That's John Podesta's brother.
[01:24:40.195 --> 01:24:41.735]  So, thank you for the call, Dan.
[01:24:41.735 --> 01:24:43.456]  Look into that and tweet that at me.
[01:24:44.016 --> 01:24:46.718]  Let's go out to O'Brien in Maryland.
[01:24:46.718 --> 01:24:49.860]  Go ahead, O'Brien.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:53.142]  Yeah, hello.
[01:24:53.142 --> 01:25:01.207]  For those who know, I called in here back in the 3rd of July to leave a point about Duff going after Hillary Clinton.
[01:25:01.207 --> 01:25:10.113]  I told everybody to pretty much wait until the 2nd or 3rd term because if he goes after these guys, they
[01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:14.701]  God, I might actually panic and start blocking him whenever he can.
[01:25:14.701 --> 01:25:27.019]  I think I hear the point you're making and that's... Well, I would say that we need to give Trump four years before we really fully judge his presidency.
[01:25:30.336 --> 01:25:33.538]  I'm not sure we have a good connection, so let's go ahead and move on from O'Brien.
[01:25:33.538 --> 01:25:35.399]  I think that's what he was saying.
[01:25:35.399 --> 01:25:39.502]  I'm not sure if I understood what he was saying, but that's kind of how I feel.
[01:25:39.502 --> 01:25:48.188]  I mean, when I look at things that Trump does that I don't necessarily agree with, or not even that, it's more stuff that you sit here and you say, why isn't Trump doing that?
[01:25:48.188 --> 01:25:49.409]  Why hasn't Trump done that?
[01:25:50.009 --> 01:25:53.730]  And I say, well, there's still time, you know, there still could be inner workings going on.
[01:25:53.730 --> 01:26:03.052]  So for those type of issues, I just, I just want to wait it out and we'll see when Trump's done being president, what he did or did not do, and then choose to scrutinize that.
[01:26:03.052 --> 01:26:08.153]  But right now, uniting America behind Trump is what is best for this country.
[01:26:08.153 --> 01:26:10.234]  Let's go to John in Wisconsin.
[01:26:10.234 --> 01:26:10.874]  Go ahead, John.
[01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:12.254]  Yeah.
[01:26:12.254 --> 01:26:13.275]  How you doing Owen?
[01:26:13.275 --> 01:26:14.615]  Doing fine.
[01:26:14.615 --> 01:26:18.696]  Hey, listen, um, Chuckie Kilmer, I saw on, uh,
[01:26:20.370 --> 01:26:42.018]  Either Fox or one of the other cable news outlets, they had like a billboard set up with all the usual Democratic mouthpieces, including Hillary, which is Chuck Schumer, Pocahontas, you know, all them, about the new Democratic Party and what they're going to be doing.
[01:26:43.332 --> 01:26:53.518]  Here's the thing about the Democrats that you have to understand, especially true for their constituents, they don't live in reality.
[01:26:53.518 --> 01:26:56.340]  So the Democrats are already dead.
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.521]  The Democrat Party is already dead.
[01:26:58.521 --> 01:27:00.783]  They will not have any more victories.
[01:27:01.744 --> 01:27:07.686]  Now, whether they try to reinvent themselves or a new party emerges is what we'll have to wait and find out.
[01:27:07.686 --> 01:27:10.127]  But the Democrats, as a party, are dead.
[01:27:10.127 --> 01:27:12.468]  They're $3.3 million in debt.
[01:27:12.468 --> 01:27:14.789]  The DNC is being sued for fraud.
[01:27:14.789 --> 01:27:23.892]  Most Democrats that have a good head on their shoulder can now see how Bernie got screwed, see how the DNC was rigged, and see how corrupt everything involved was.
[01:27:23.892 --> 01:27:26.493]  So, the Democrats are dead.
[01:27:26.493 --> 01:27:27.693]  They can deny they're dead.
[01:27:27.693 --> 01:27:29.914]  Their constituents can deny they're dead.
[01:27:29.914 --> 01:27:30.554]  But they're dead!
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.321]  Is that all, John?
[01:27:35.321 --> 01:27:37.263]  No, I've got a comment, too.
[01:27:37.263 --> 01:27:59.618]  I was going through the page this morning and the article about the change in the way they're going to be holding the Mitch McCaul, you know, for the news outlets.
[01:27:59.618 --> 01:28:00.359]  Press briefings?
[01:28:01.791 --> 01:28:02.752]  No, no, no, no.
[01:28:02.752 --> 01:28:04.614]  I had a brain fart.
[01:28:04.614 --> 01:28:08.236]  There's a picture of Spicer up at the top of the page.
[01:28:08.236 --> 01:28:14.681]  I wonder if anybody else besides me noticed that he had his American flag on his left lapel upside down.
[01:28:14.681 --> 01:28:20.506]  You're saying Spicer had his lapel on upside down?
[01:28:20.506 --> 01:28:24.128]  He had the flag upside down on his left lapel, yeah.
[01:28:24.128 --> 01:28:24.649]  When was that?
[01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:32.015]  It was on your article on M4's webpage about the transition.
[01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:32.135]  Okay.
[01:28:32.135 --> 01:28:33.736]  Alright, we'll pull that up.
[01:28:33.736 --> 01:28:34.297]  That's interesting.
[01:28:34.297 --> 01:28:35.258]  I didn't notice that.
[01:28:35.258 --> 01:28:39.841]  I'm not sure if there's a store to that or not.
[01:28:39.841 --> 01:28:46.887]  But they're saying that this is the new Trump shakehouse in the White House to bring in outsiders.
[01:28:46.887 --> 01:28:48.729]  Sean Spicer was an insider.
[01:28:48.729 --> 01:28:51.891]  Scaramucci, whether you like him or not, was an outsider.
[01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:52.372]  So is this
[01:28:53.556 --> 01:28:56.538]  Started the move to drain the swamp with the insiders, with the outsiders.
[01:28:56.538 --> 01:28:57.799]  We'll find out more of your calls on their side.
[01:28:57.799 --> 01:29:06.166]  Did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:06.706]  That's right.
[01:29:06.706 --> 01:29:11.970]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights freeze dryers.

[01:29:26.218 --> 01:29:26.458]  Woo!
[01:29:26.458 --> 01:29:27.498]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:29:27.498 --> 01:29:36.242]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:29:36.242 --> 01:29:44.344]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:29:45.825 --> 01:29:49.268]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[01:35:03.123 --> 01:35:09.009]  Just to, in regards to the last caller talking about the picture of Sean Spicer with his lapel pin upside down.
[01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:14.674]  It does appear that whatever picture you were talking about and the report probably do not correlate.
[01:35:14.674 --> 01:35:24.601]  It was most likely a picture that was taken from some other date that we used on the story and the pin was probably just most likely upside down just by chance and not on purpose.
[01:35:24.601 --> 01:35:26.082]  So I just wanted to address that.
[01:35:26.082 --> 01:35:27.903]  Now let's go back out to the phone lines.
[01:35:27.903 --> 01:35:29.824]  Let's go to Wylde in Wisconsin.
[01:35:29.824 --> 01:35:32.826]  Hey Owen.
[01:35:32.826 --> 01:35:33.427]  Hey Alex.
[01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:37.630]  I was just wondering what was your opinion on Trump's uncle?
[01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:41.991]  What uncle?
[01:35:41.991 --> 01:35:43.552]  I don't even know.
[01:35:43.552 --> 01:35:45.192]  The one that was with Tesla or whatever?
[01:35:45.192 --> 01:35:48.133]  The MIT professor, yes.
[01:35:48.133 --> 01:35:50.494]  The one who worked with Tesla?
[01:35:50.494 --> 01:35:56.875]  He got all of Tesla's trunks of inventions afterwards.
[01:35:56.875 --> 01:36:00.096]  So alright, here's the deal, here's the deal.
[01:36:00.096 --> 01:36:03.817]  Are you trying to take me down the rabbit hole with this guy?
[01:36:03.817 --> 01:36:04.537]  Oh no.
[01:36:04.537 --> 01:36:06.538]  No, if I was going to take you down the rabbit hole, I'd tell you.
[01:36:08.359 --> 01:36:19.286]  Well, all I will say is, I can't really comment on Trump's uncle much, but what I will say is, the connection to Tesla is very funny in a good way.
[01:36:19.286 --> 01:36:23.929]  I think it's cool that there was that connection, and then what you just mentioned about his inventions.
[01:36:23.929 --> 01:36:32.835]  And if Donald Trump is a time traveler, as people like to rumor on the internet, or perhaps Barron Trump is a time traveler, here's all I'll say.
[01:36:32.835 --> 01:36:36.538]  It's funny, it's fun, people are following it, but I will tell you,
[01:36:37.438 --> 01:36:41.946]  Have you heard of the book, Barron Trump's Magical Mystery Adventures with his dog, Bulger?
[01:36:41.946 --> 01:36:43.549]  Have you heard of this?
[01:36:43.549 --> 01:36:44.731]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:36:44.731 --> 01:36:46.855]  I think it's more coincidences.
[01:36:46.855 --> 01:36:49.219]  You know, you look for 777, you'll find it everywhere.
[01:36:50.686 --> 01:36:51.846]  So it is odd, though.
[01:36:51.846 --> 01:36:53.947]  I mean, what are the odds?
[01:36:53.947 --> 01:36:54.808]  It's meme magic.
[01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:57.789]  And I will tell you, I've actually ordered a copy of that book.
[01:36:57.789 --> 01:36:58.949]  It was published in 1889.
[01:36:58.949 --> 01:37:03.431]  It was very hard to get a hand on this book, folks.
[01:37:03.431 --> 01:37:04.251]  It was very hard.
[01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:07.632]  The author is Ingersoll Lockwood.
[01:37:07.632 --> 01:37:11.734]  He printed a series of four books about Barron Trump's magical mystery adventures.
[01:37:11.734 --> 01:37:14.835]  There's a meme on the Internet about Barron Trump being a time traveler.
[01:37:14.835 --> 01:37:16.516]  And then he published a book in
[01:37:17.276 --> 01:37:17.497]  I think?
[01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:41.220]  Leftist communist writing in the streets being against a hotel on 5th Avenue in New York.
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.780]  That's Trump Hotel.
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:44.942]  And again, this was published in 1896.
[01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:54.307]  So, pretty amazing coincidences by this author Ingersoll Lockwood that I actually enjoy sci-fi fantasy writing.
[01:37:54.307 --> 01:37:56.328]  I actually enjoy this writing, so it was amazing.
[01:37:56.328 --> 01:37:58.450]  He writes about this guy, Barron Trump.
[01:37:58.450 --> 01:38:00.911]  But yeah, that's pretty much all I know about that stuff.
[01:38:00.911 --> 01:38:02.112]  Is there anything else you wanted to say?
[01:38:04.806 --> 01:38:11.510]  Well, I think it's important that he should address it because it's like connected to the energy crisis, the healthcare.
[01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:12.910]  We're living in Tesla's world.
[01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:14.371]  The polyphase generator.
[01:38:14.371 --> 01:38:21.296]  Well, yeah, yeah, I mean Nikola Tesla created the modern-day electrical generators and grid, yes.
[01:38:21.296 --> 01:38:26.999]  Radio transmission, RF signals, x-rays, all Tesla stuff.
[01:38:26.999 --> 01:38:28.600]  And, you know, it's
[01:38:29.224 --> 01:38:42.573]  I think it's pretty much the panacea because free energy, unlimited energy, which was Tesla's magnum opus, would pretty much knock down globalists.
[01:38:42.573 --> 01:38:43.714]  You'd hit them in every wallet.
[01:38:47.179 --> 01:38:52.922]  Well, we know that they've been suppressing, you know, medical breakthroughs, energy breakthroughs.
[01:38:52.922 --> 01:38:59.786]  That's just what happens when you have so much power to control the market and to stop anything from infiltrating it.
[01:38:59.786 --> 01:39:03.688]  But Trump said in his inaugural address that we're going to find these things out together.
[01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:05.669]  We're going to find the mysteries of the universe together.
[01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:11.032]  So, you know, maybe he is going to come through on that in the first four years of his presidency.
[01:39:11.032 --> 01:39:15.035]  I was told in the break that he said on the Alex Jones Show when he came on to give him a year.
[01:39:16.015 --> 01:39:18.158]  So we're about halfway there.
[01:39:18.158 --> 01:39:20.140]  So we'll continue to monitor that.
[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:28.508]  But yeah, his uncle's relation to Tesla has created a lot of meme magic, and it's introduced me magically to an author I ended up enjoying from the late 1800s.
[01:39:28.508 --> 01:39:31.071]  So thank you for that call, Wild from Wisconsin.
[01:39:31.071 --> 01:39:34.434]  Let's go to Derek in Nebraska.
[01:39:34.434 --> 01:39:36.837]  All right, Derek, you are up.
[01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:37.578]  Go ahead, Derek.
[01:39:39.431 --> 01:39:40.271]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:39:40.271 --> 01:39:44.674]  I just want to... First and foremost, I just want to thank you for what you and Alex and everyone on NPR News do.
[01:39:44.674 --> 01:39:49.716]  You guys are the tip of the spoon for sure, but I just want to go and kind of talk about with, you know, the Trump agenda.
[01:39:49.716 --> 01:39:52.018]  Everybody seems to be criticizing him, especially on the right.
[01:39:52.018 --> 01:39:53.178]  Oh, he's not getting nothing done.
[01:39:53.178 --> 01:39:54.839]  He's not getting nothing done.
[01:39:54.839 --> 01:39:59.842]  I actually worked on Capitol Hill, and I actually just left a couple months ago, but I worked there.
[01:40:00.604 --> 01:40:07.969]  And it's not just Trump versus the Democrats, it's Trump versus absolutely almost everyone in an entire swamp of D.C.
[01:40:07.969 --> 01:40:15.394]  And I mean, the fact that he's going against tens of thousands of people, 100 senators who almost all of them hate him, and 435 Congressmen that are against him,
[01:40:16.054 --> 01:40:17.514]  I think it's remarkable what he's done.
[01:40:17.514 --> 01:40:18.555]  Well, I hear what you're saying.
[01:40:18.555 --> 01:40:19.515]  I hear what you're saying.
[01:40:19.515 --> 01:40:34.398]  We need to make Congress great again in 2018, and it's going to be up to us to stop the obstructionists or the Democrats by electing the right people in 2018 that want to get behind Trump's agenda, get behind the Make America Great Again movement.
[01:40:34.398 --> 01:40:40.200]  That doesn't mean they have to want to see Ida Iowa Trump on everything, but at least the America First policy.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:40.840]  That would be nice.
[01:40:41.912 --> 01:40:42.612]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:42.612 --> 01:40:48.295]  I mean, all of these politicians, or at least most of them, they don't really want America to succeed.
[01:40:48.295 --> 01:40:49.495]  They don't want to pass tax reform.
[01:40:49.495 --> 01:40:51.556]  They don't want to clearly repeal Obamacare.
[01:40:51.556 --> 01:40:53.236]  Or there's a dozen other things.
[01:40:53.236 --> 01:40:56.678]  Or they could be corrupt and they're worried for their own political future.
[01:40:56.678 --> 01:41:02.180]  Or perhaps they're just a dead duck politician and they don't think they can get re-elected, so they're worried about that.
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:05.361]  There's all different angles, but you're definitely right.
[01:41:05.361 --> 01:41:08.883]  And the weird thing of it is, I don't know if you've been following the
[01:41:10.675 --> 01:41:17.497]  Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai versus Deal in the Republican primaries in Massachusetts.
[01:41:17.497 --> 01:41:21.938]  I don't know if you've been following that and some of the weirdness that's been going on with the media there.
[01:41:21.938 --> 01:41:24.959]  Photoshop pictures, just weird stuff.
[01:41:24.959 --> 01:41:27.380]  And what Dr. Shiva is saying, he thinks he's
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:28.500]  Hello?
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:28.760]  Oh, hello.
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:28.840]  Well...
[01:41:54.554 --> 01:42:03.199]  Well, I was originally want to come up one of the first things was this whole Roger Stone borrows bull that I haven't really heard about whether he has sued him yet.
[01:42:03.199 --> 01:42:05.581]  I was wondering, is he going to sue him yet?
[01:42:05.581 --> 01:42:10.044]  Or is he just gonna let it flow until something else happens with that?
[01:42:10.859 --> 01:42:15.141]  You know, I'm sure Roger will be on this week to address that.
[01:42:15.141 --> 01:42:17.282]  I think that they had sued him.
[01:42:17.282 --> 01:42:32.509]  I don't know what litigation process is that they were currently undergoing in order to get that through, but my guess is that they will not end up suing him because they don't want him to testify in court.
[01:42:32.509 --> 01:42:35.071]  Oh, and then another thing I wanted to address
[01:42:35.959 --> 01:42:37.401]  Yeah, finish your point.
[01:42:37.401 --> 01:42:38.061]  Five seconds.
[01:42:38.061 --> 01:42:39.503]  He just wants prosperity.
[01:42:52.912 --> 01:42:54.934]  Yeah, more lies, more lies from the media.
[01:42:54.934 --> 01:42:57.876]  That's all the media does from MSNBC to CNN.
[01:42:57.876 --> 01:43:02.541]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:43:02.541 --> 01:43:11.869]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors
[01:43:11.869 --> 01:43:12.369]  We're good to go!
[01:43:35.792 --> 01:43:38.153]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.

[01:43:59.839 --> 01:44:01.920]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.841]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:44:04.841 --> 01:44:10.904]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:44:10.904 --> 01:44:20.089]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.

[01:44:27.613 --> 01:44:35.658]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:44:35.658 --> 01:44:36.719]  The general public doesn't.
[01:44:37.828 --> 01:44:41.773]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:44:41.773 --> 01:44:45.337]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:44:45.337 --> 01:44:52.065]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:44:52.065 --> 01:44:56.210]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[01:45:00.351 --> 01:45:01.792]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:45:01.792 --> 01:45:03.113]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:45:03.113 --> 01:45:04.314]  Why is this so good?
[01:45:04.314 --> 01:45:09.599]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:45:09.599 --> 01:45:23.152]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:45:23.152 --> 01:45:24.513]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:45:25.294 --> 01:45:26.935]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:45:26.935 --> 01:45:29.496]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:45:29.496 --> 01:45:30.796]  These are all parasites.
[01:45:30.796 --> 01:45:31.917]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:45:31.917 --> 01:45:33.257]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:45:33.257 --> 01:45:37.759]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:45:37.759 --> 01:45:41.021]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:45:41.021 --> 01:45:44.102]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:45:44.102 --> 01:45:45.142]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:45:45.142 --> 01:45:47.063]  LivingDefense, InfowarsLife.com.
[01:45:47.063 --> 01:45:48.104]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:45:48.104 --> 01:45:50.805]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:45:50.805 --> 01:45:51.025]  And, uh,
[01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:52.706]  You support the broadcast.
[01:45:52.706 --> 01:45:54.066]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:45:54.066 --> 01:45:56.307]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:45:56.307 --> 01:45:59.869]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:45:59.869 --> 01:46:02.891]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[01:46:02.891 --> 01:46:07.093]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:46:07.093 --> 01:46:14.416]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:46:14.416 --> 01:46:17.538]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:46:18.258 --> 01:46:37.754]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:46:38.294 --> 01:46:42.417]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:46:42.417 --> 01:46:53.665]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:46:53.665 --> 01:47:02.191]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:47:02.191 --> 01:47:04.893]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:27.535 --> 01:47:29.237]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:29.237 --> 01:47:30.878]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:30.878 --> 01:47:37.104]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.

[01:48:24.643 --> 01:48:27.245]  Some final stories I'm going to mention here before we close out the callers.
[01:48:27.245 --> 01:48:28.466]  Callers, please make it quick.
[01:48:28.466 --> 01:48:29.547]  Get to your points.
[01:48:29.547 --> 01:48:30.167]  Here's a story.
[01:48:30.167 --> 01:48:33.510]  In Chicago, women worried about violence joined gun club
[01:48:34.557 --> 01:48:39.659]  And it tells a very powerful story about 71-year-old Marietta Crowder.
[01:48:39.659 --> 01:48:43.641]  She has rheumatoid arthritis and she lives in Chicago.
[01:48:43.641 --> 01:48:49.343]  And she is now taking gun training to learn how to use a firearm to protect herself.
[01:48:49.343 --> 01:48:50.764]  And I salute that.
[01:48:50.764 --> 01:48:55.365]  That is the answer to gun violence, is protecting yourself with a gun.
[01:48:57.106 --> 01:48:58.806]  That's just been proven time and time again.
[01:48:58.806 --> 01:49:01.467]  That's why you call a police officer when you're in trouble.
[01:49:01.467 --> 01:49:08.128]  Do-nothing Congress reaches 200 days with Obamacare and massive taxes still in place.
[01:49:08.128 --> 01:49:09.589]  Yes, that's the do-nothing Congress.
[01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:14.670]  That's the obstructionist Congress led by Paul Ryan, led by Chuck Schumer.
[01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:16.070]  This is the swamp.
[01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:18.691]  These are the people that have to go.
[01:49:18.691 --> 01:49:20.451]  They promised that they would repeal Obamacare.
[01:49:20.451 --> 01:49:22.472]  They ran on that for seven years.
[01:49:22.472 --> 01:49:23.252]  They lied.
[01:49:23.252 --> 01:49:23.972]  They did nothing.
[01:49:24.392 --> 01:49:25.012]  I love this story!
[01:49:25.012 --> 01:49:27.574]  The irony is so rich in this you could cut it with a dull knife!
[01:49:54.292 --> 01:49:59.298]  I can't believe that this is the final segment of the show just two hours in.
[01:49:59.298 --> 01:50:00.439]  Time flies by.
[01:50:00.439 --> 01:50:02.942]  I could be on for hours with y'all.
[01:50:10.922 --> 01:50:11.882]  Yeah, it does fly, man.
[01:50:11.882 --> 01:50:17.924]  Hey, I was just calling, man, I know it's kind of far-fetched, it's far out, but hey, man, Alex Jones, 2024, baby.
[01:50:17.924 --> 01:50:18.324]  2024.
[01:50:18.324 --> 01:50:24.885]  Is there not anybody else that's talking about politics, about the news, about the world, about countries?
[01:50:24.885 --> 01:50:33.807]  Who knows more about this world that's pro all of us who want the Trump agenda, who wants prosperity than Alex Jones?
[01:50:33.807 --> 01:50:35.788]  Look, man, here's the thing, here's the thing.
[01:50:35.788 --> 01:50:37.648]  I hear what you're saying, I hear what you're saying.
[01:50:37.648 --> 01:50:40.029]  Look, if Alex is, I mean, I, you know,
[01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:42.582]  Alex doesn't want to be a politician.
[01:50:42.582 --> 01:50:43.944]  I don't blame him, okay?
[01:50:43.944 --> 01:51:03.901]  I wouldn't want to be a politician, and you gotta understand that even though Trump has been under such scorn, such scrutiny, such attack, folks, I mean, even myself, I mean, I'm not sitting here acting like I'm some sort of a bad guy, but I mean, my God, I can only imagine the attacks that would be coming against me if I was to run for any office.
[01:51:03.901 --> 01:51:07.664]  I would want nothing to do with that, and they would be bad, I mean, so it's just like,
[01:51:08.365 --> 01:51:11.667]  Hey Owen, thanks for taking the call and I gotta say, I gotta talk about this
[01:51:32.608 --> 01:51:34.530]  Spicer to Scaramucci transition.
[01:51:34.530 --> 01:51:38.014]  I think it's laughable that he's being portrayed as an outsider.
[01:51:38.014 --> 01:51:41.438]  He's given money to Obama, to Clinton, endorsed Jeb Bush.
[01:51:41.438 --> 01:51:45.302]  He's been rubbing elbows with all kinds of big time players.
[01:51:45.302 --> 01:51:48.346]  Go look at the conferences he hosted as the head of Skybridge Capital.
[01:51:49.046 --> 01:51:50.247]  Oh no, I hear what you're saying.
[01:51:50.247 --> 01:51:51.807]  I'll go along with that train of thought.
[01:51:51.807 --> 01:51:53.788]  And he also was on Fox News in 2015 bashing Donald Trump.
[01:51:53.788 --> 01:51:56.129]  I believe he called him a con man.
[01:51:56.129 --> 01:51:57.190]  The way I see it though is...
[01:52:15.859 --> 01:52:24.166]  If these guys really want to play ball, and they really want to be on Trump's team, and he believes that, then I think that they at least deserve a chance.
[01:52:24.166 --> 01:52:30.872]  Now, maybe he could end up being another member of the swamp, maybe not, but I think the reason that Trump put him in there is because he views him
[01:52:31.813 --> 01:52:34.394]  Well, I think the Scaramucci's probably got very much in line of
[01:53:01.298 --> 01:53:01.979]  I don't
[01:53:16.398 --> 01:53:17.479]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:53:17.479 --> 01:53:19.080]  He's not in there for policy.
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.121]  He's not in there because he has any agenda.
[01:53:21.121 --> 01:53:25.744]  He is in there to dictate communication between the White House and the press.
[01:53:25.744 --> 01:53:27.325]  Dictate a news cycle.
[01:53:27.325 --> 01:53:28.366]  That is his job.
[01:53:28.366 --> 01:53:30.428]  So, that is what Trump put him in there for.
[01:53:30.428 --> 01:53:34.470]  We'll see if he ends up going towards Obama policies or not.
[01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:35.711]  But they're fair points, Greg.
[01:53:35.711 --> 01:53:37.973]  I'm not ignoring what you're saying.
[01:53:37.973 --> 01:53:39.914]  I'm just more along the lines of a we'll see.
[01:53:39.914 --> 01:53:41.535]  But I know what you're saying.
[01:53:41.535 --> 01:53:42.636]  I'm not discounting that.
[01:53:42.636 --> 01:53:43.776]  Let's go to Dez.
[01:53:43.776 --> 01:53:45.197]  Final caller of the day.
[01:53:45.197 --> 01:53:45.938]  Go ahead, Dez.
[01:53:46.978 --> 01:53:49.099]  Hey Owen, first off, sharp tie.
[01:53:49.099 --> 01:53:52.381]  I'm calling in today to talk about the rise of akathisia.
[01:53:52.381 --> 01:53:59.044]  Akathisia being a neuropsychiatric side effect due to increasing lithium.
[01:53:59.044 --> 01:54:03.326]  And I just want to bring people's attention to it and say, you know what, is it something they're putting in the water?
[01:54:03.326 --> 01:54:06.787]  We know through... Well, lithium, they're spraying lithium in the air.
[01:54:06.787 --> 01:54:13.010]  I believe it's part of the aerosol geo climate change thing or geoengineering.
[01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:14.251]  I believe lithium is part of that.
[01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:17.331]  Well, we know lithium causes akathisia.
[01:54:17.331 --> 01:54:23.454]  It's so prevalent now, they're starting to advertise akathisia-related TV commercials.
[01:54:23.454 --> 01:54:28.696]  So, it's just another tool in the control matrix, and it's something I think people should be aware of.
[01:54:28.696 --> 01:54:30.297]  Maybe go out, buy eco-science.
[01:54:30.297 --> 01:54:31.437]  Oh, wait a second!
[01:54:31.437 --> 01:54:32.898]  Oh, wait a second, Des.
[01:54:32.898 --> 01:54:34.679]  Didn't you hear Chuck Schumer earlier?
[01:54:34.679 --> 01:54:37.220]  Chuck Schumer, he's got your back, bro.
[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:37.560]  Does he?
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:38.261]  What's he saying?
[01:54:38.261 --> 01:54:42.182]  Chuck Schumer, Chuck Schumer, he's gonna watch out for these big drug companies, man.
[01:54:42.182 --> 01:54:43.363]  He's gonna keep them under control.
[01:54:44.162 --> 01:54:45.604]  Oh sure, well I'd like to see that.
[01:54:45.604 --> 01:54:48.508]  You know, that's the epidemic we're facing here.
[01:54:48.508 --> 01:54:51.793]  Everyone, they're off the label, writing psychotropic medicines for everything.
[01:54:51.793 --> 01:54:52.834]  Wait a second, wait a second.
[01:54:52.834 --> 01:54:57.660]  Sir, sir, Des, Des, are you saying you don't trust Chuck Schumer?
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:54:59.803]  I don't think I do, no.
[01:54:59.803 --> 01:55:01.666]  I don't trust Zarma, I don't trust...
[01:55:02.464 --> 01:55:04.185]  Don't trust Big Pharma?
[01:55:04.185 --> 01:55:05.245]  Come on, Dez!
[01:55:05.245 --> 01:55:07.747]  The side effects are not that bad.
[01:55:07.747 --> 01:55:08.687]  Death?
[01:55:08.687 --> 01:55:09.387]  Blindness?
[01:55:09.387 --> 01:55:10.408]  Guillain-Barre?
[01:55:10.408 --> 01:55:11.668]  I mean, come on!
[01:55:11.668 --> 01:55:15.130]  Oh, sure, yeah, I'd like to spend a week in the ICU.
[01:55:15.130 --> 01:55:16.030]  What's the big deal?
[01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:17.291]  It's paid for by Obamacare.
[01:55:19.011 --> 01:55:19.992]  It's bad, you know?
[01:55:19.992 --> 01:55:24.758]  And it just makes you wonder, was something like the Flint incident, was that, you know, engineered?
[01:55:24.758 --> 01:55:27.261]  Is that a control grid kind of takeover?
[01:55:27.261 --> 01:55:27.942]  You know what?
[01:55:27.942 --> 01:55:29.023]  Thank you for that call.
[01:55:29.023 --> 01:55:29.404]  I'm glad.
[01:55:29.404 --> 01:55:30.285]  We're going to end it with that.
[01:55:30.285 --> 01:55:33.068]  Speaking of engineered, speaking of controlled takeover,
[01:55:34.406 --> 01:55:47.457]  An anonymous user posted on a website named Swordfish saying that he has damning evidence of Hollywood pedophiles, music industry pedophiles, Washington D.C.
[01:55:47.457 --> 01:55:59.206]  pedophiles, and apparently he, this anonymous white hat hacker, is set to release this evidence in the next 24 hours against these industries if none of his four demands are met.
[01:55:59.206 --> 01:56:00.828]  None of this person's four demands are going to be met.
[01:56:01.428 --> 01:56:03.209]  Everybody is sending this to me on Twitter.
[01:56:03.209 --> 01:56:13.372]  Everybody who's connected into the, you know, the Reddits and the 4chans and some of those websites are all talking about this user who put this on pull.
[01:56:13.372 --> 01:56:17.113]  This was the first thing that came to my mind because, you know, I can't really report on this stuff.
[01:56:17.113 --> 01:56:20.614]  There's not much there, at least for me to report on factually.
[01:56:20.614 --> 01:56:26.356]  But what came to my head when I started reading this and when I started to see the response was,
[01:56:27.259 --> 01:56:36.385]  First of all, why wouldn't you just release that stuff to begin with, and then this person says he can't yet, he wants it to be controlled, he wants to have it go out the right way, or whatever.
[01:56:36.385 --> 01:56:41.168]  But my train of thought took me in a different direction, because of course everybody sees this, everybody wants it to be true.
[01:56:41.168 --> 01:56:48.473]  They want these people to be exposed, they want this whole pizza gate, pedo gate thing to come to a conclusion, and they want to see some justice.
[01:56:49.133 --> 01:56:59.219]  But I thought of a different angle because this, again, this is an anonymous user on a website claiming they have this and says that they're going to dox a bunch of celebrities.
[01:56:59.219 --> 01:57:02.781]  They're going to put out a bunch of personal and private information on these celebrities.
[01:57:02.781 --> 01:57:04.962]  So my mind actually went in a different direction.
[01:57:06.576 --> 01:57:09.277]  Watch out for a false flag here, folks.
[01:57:09.277 --> 01:57:10.837]  Watch out for a false flag.
[01:57:10.837 --> 01:57:31.682]  Beware of somebody doxing a bunch of celebrities, doxing a bunch of politicians, claiming it's the alt-right, claiming it's free press, claiming they're trying to stop pedophiles, and then here comes big old government to take control of the internet because all these celebrities and all these politicians just got doxed and it was nothing more than a false flag.
[01:57:32.262 --> 01:57:34.725]  So keep your ears pinned back, folks.
[01:57:34.725 --> 01:57:37.688]  We've got a war going on right now for the future of this country.
[01:57:37.688 --> 01:57:40.571]  We've got a war going on for truth.
[01:57:40.571 --> 01:57:44.536]  And it's up to you to make sure that we are victorious.
[01:57:44.536 --> 01:57:45.597]  And we are right now.
[01:57:45.597 --> 01:57:47.199]  You stay classy, InfoWarriors.
