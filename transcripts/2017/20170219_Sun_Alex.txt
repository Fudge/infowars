[00:00:02.732 --> 00:00:12.259]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:13.820]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.582]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:25.948]  Alright, Trump gave his most powerful speech yet, right after he gave his most powerful press conference yet on Thursday.
[00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:30.150]  On Friday he came out and said the media, the MSM is the enemy of the American people.
[00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.972]  Yesterday in Florida, in Melbourne,
[00:00:32.953 --> 00:00:43.062]  He came out and threw the gauntlet down but at the end of the speech he explained that we have one destiny together to be free and we need to come together and be part of that American destiny.
[00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:46.003]  The stretch is back to 1776.
[00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:50.987]  And that put the globalists into absolute fits of rage.
[00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:52.168]  This is epic.
[00:00:52.168 --> 00:01:01.656]  The next two hours is not two hours you'll want to miss because this is humanity, the sleeping giant, awakening to the globalist program.
[00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:06.100]  So here's President Trump going right to the people as he attempts to restore the republic.
[00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.745]  We have the chance now, working together, to deliver change for the ages.
[00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:16.029]  This will be change for the ages.
[00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:18.571]  Change like never before.
[00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:24.418]  To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity.
[00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:29.876]  We want to secure our borders and protect our workers.
[00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:33.477]  To rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
[00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:38.138]  To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods.
[00:01:38.138 --> 00:01:42.200]  To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.001]  To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce.
[00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:57.936]  To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation.
[00:01:57.936 --> 00:02:06.504]  And to replace chasms of distrust with new bridges of opportunity and cooperation.
[00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:11.768]  We must ignore the tired echoes of yesterday's fights.
[00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:15.592]  We're fighting battles that no longer help us.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.487]  We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.
[00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:36.137]  I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries.
[00:02:36.137 --> 00:02:39.299]  They're not paying their bills.
[00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.601]  They're not paying their bills.
[00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:43.643]  They have to help us.
[00:02:43.643 --> 00:02:44.364]  No longer
[00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:50.504]  Are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past?
[00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:57.891]  No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about but failure.
[00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:01.894]  New circumstances demand new solutions.
[00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:06.699]  Americans have fought and won wars together.
[00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.002]  Our heroes have shed their blood together.
[00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:12.587]  And lost their lives.
[00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:29.734]  Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next, stretching back to the first day of our American independence.
[00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:31.515]  This is our legacy.
[00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:33.476]  It belongs to all of you.
[00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:38.978]  And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.
[00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:49.983]  Now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold action.
[00:03:49.983 --> 00:03:59.465]  Let us move past the differences of party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country.
[00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:01.646]  We are all brothers and all sisters.
[00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:08.907]  We share one home, one destiny, and one glorious American flag.
[00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:18.311]  We're united together by history and by providence.
[00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:21.393]  We will make America strong again.
[00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:23.235]  I promise.
[00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:28.038]  We will make America proud again.
[00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:31.441]  We will make America safe again.
[00:04:33.343 --> 00:04:41.831]  And we will make America great again, greater than ever before.
[00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:47.416]  May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.
[00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:47.937]  Thank you.
[00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:49.038]  Thank you.
[00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:51.000]  Thank you very much.
[00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:01.123]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.123 --> 00:05:06.286]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:09.568]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:05:09.568 --> 00:05:15.371]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:21.074]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[00:05:21.494 --> 00:05:24.477]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:30.042]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:05:30.042 --> 00:05:37.069]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.614]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:45.177]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:47.279]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:53.004]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:55.426]  Check it out at PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[00:05:55.426 --> 00:05:57.127]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[00:06:04.411 --> 00:06:14.055]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[00:06:14.055 --> 00:06:21.859]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:51.188]  Ladies and gentlemen, to watch President Trump fly into Melbourne, Florida yesterday, with Flight of the Valkyries, blasting out like the Gouter Dameron, the battle of the gods, the twilight of the earth was upon us, was amazing.
[00:06:53.046 --> 00:07:19.913]  But even more amazing, out of the hundreds of news articles I have here that are all incredibly important, is CNBC, MSNBC, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and CNN, all here in my right hand, as TV viewers can see, as radio listeners can imagine, admit the best consumer spending and small business startups and numbers we've ever seen in 25 years.
[00:07:19.913 --> 00:07:20.673]  All because of Trump.
[00:07:22.082 --> 00:07:25.124]  And optimism and the American people waking up and taking action.
[00:07:25.124 --> 00:07:25.844]  That's coming up.
[00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:26.805]  I'm going to get to the stack.
[00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:28.566]  It is so big.
[00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:31.227]  See, globalists want to pick winners and losers.
[00:07:31.227 --> 00:07:35.669]  Trump just wants to have a big fat free market, which will even empower the elites even more.
[00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.652]  But see, they don't want you to have any piece of the pie.
[00:07:40.652 --> 00:07:41.753]  So we've got that information.
[00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:46.377]  I'm here because I want to be among the people.
[00:07:46.377 --> 00:07:55.666]  Trump continues his assault on fake news and corrupt media with campaign-style rally in front of 9,000 in Florida with another 10,000 that couldn't get in after a rough week at White House.
[00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:56.666]  Daily Mail.
[00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:57.787]  Rough week?
[00:07:57.787 --> 00:07:58.628]  Oh, it was really rough.
[00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:02.552]  His approval rating went up five points.
[00:08:02.552 --> 00:08:04.153]  And five points the week before that.
[00:08:04.153 --> 00:08:06.195]  Oh, it's so rough.
[00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:08.397]  Like, if you win the lottery, it's just so rough.
[00:08:11.493 --> 00:08:12.854]  So we're going to break all that down.
[00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:17.418]  Bypassing MSM, Trump briefs Americans directly on national security.
[00:08:17.418 --> 00:08:20.040]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:26.486]  Meanwhile, Jay Sekulow has come out and pointed out on Fox News that Obama should be held accountable for the soft coup against Trump.
[00:08:26.486 --> 00:08:34.052]  President Obama, James Clamper, Loretta Lynch should be held accountable for the illegal leaks and the attempt to overthrow the elected president of the United States.
[00:08:34.052 --> 00:08:36.234]  That's all coming up today as well.
[00:08:36.234 --> 00:08:37.996]  But if you want to know who the liars are here,
[00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:48.621]  As Trump delivers with the facts and delivers with known economic policies that are one-sided because special corporate interests were selling out our interests for money.
[00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:52.522]  He's just getting rid of the unfair playing field.
[00:08:52.522 --> 00:08:54.103]  People think he's like a saint for doing it.
[00:08:54.103 --> 00:08:55.503]  He's just not out to get us.
[00:08:55.503 --> 00:08:57.463]  He just wouldn't do it.
[00:08:57.463 --> 00:09:00.704]  Let's look at what the Pope and Angela Merkel had to say.
[00:09:00.704 --> 00:09:03.445]  Now the Pope just three months ago came out in an encyclical
[00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:06.086]  It was picked up by papers that weren't said.
[00:09:06.086 --> 00:09:16.050]  It makes him nauseous to hear about Europe's Christian roots and not opening up to Islam and their giant baby boom.
[00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.332]  Yeah, the Pope said he gets nauseous hearing about Christians and Christian roots.
[00:09:20.332 --> 00:09:23.894]  In case you think I'm joking, here's mainstream news.
[00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:26.035]  It's AP, Reuters, everybody has it.
[00:09:26.035 --> 00:09:30.517]  Pope Francis, Muslim terrorism does not exist, close quote.
[00:09:33.812 --> 00:09:38.433]  And next he's going to tell me that Donald Trump doesn't wear red ties or fish don't swim in the ocean?
[00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:42.315]  I mean, this is the guy that said we couldn't have Donald Trump.
[00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.275]  But it gets better.
[00:09:44.275 --> 00:09:49.177]  In an impassioned address Friday, Pope Francis denied the existence of Islamic terrorism.
[00:09:50.447 --> 00:09:52.409]  Simultaneously calling for open borders.
[00:09:52.409 --> 00:09:54.471]  Here's another one on the Daily Star.
[00:09:54.471 --> 00:09:59.755]  Angela Merkel says Europe must take more refugees and Islam isn't the source of terror.
[00:09:59.755 --> 00:10:04.639]  That's why most Muslim countries are killing each other and selling women on slave blocks.
[00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:08.843]  And they call us the fake news.
[00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:13.127]  No, the truth is we're the straight up news and you better get used to it, ladies and gentlemen, because
[00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:21.216]  I was talking to the New York Times the last few days, there's some big profile piece tomorrow, and they're like, oh, we don't believe you have five billion views.
[00:10:21.216 --> 00:10:27.141]  So I added up five billion views on YouTube enough from just different channels and sent them a link.
[00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:28.362]  They had to admit it to me over the phone.
[00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:31.645]  I said, so does anybody else have a billion or two billion?
[00:10:31.645 --> 00:10:32.306]  No, they don't.
[00:10:32.306 --> 00:10:32.526]  Yes.
[00:10:32.526 --> 00:10:33.207]  Do we have the most?
[00:10:33.207 --> 00:10:34.708]  Yes, we do.
[00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:36.469]  Five billion views.
[00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.271]  On our channels.
[00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:57.967]  Not bragging, it's just, I'm sick of like, these people hopping around with CNN shows, with the average show like 100,000, 200,000 viewers, their biggest shows, a million viewers, just telling me all day, I'm fake news, when all I'm doing is quoting the Pope, quoting the Saudi Arabians, quoting Merkel.
[00:10:57.967 --> 00:10:58.508]  It's crazy.
[00:10:58.508 --> 00:11:03.312]  Yeah, one channel we've got, it's got 100, it's got a billion, 200 million views on it.
[00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:10.120]  This is the frustration, and we're on hundreds of commercial radio stations, but I don't have to sit here and announce how big we are.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.482]  The point is, they're a joke!
[00:11:12.482 --> 00:11:17.285]  MSM is collapsing because it's so sold out.
[00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:20.648]  Before I go any further here, let me start getting to these clips.
[00:11:20.648 --> 00:11:24.551]  Because I've said this, Rand Paul's not perfect, but he's a good man.
[00:11:25.874 --> 00:11:49.532]  A good senator who exposed the carbon taxes, the bankrupt our coal industry, that exposed the open borders, that exposed the gun control, that exposed that our government under Hillary and Obama and under the next Secretary of State as well, not just Hillary, but John Kerry, were funding Al-Qaeda that changed his name to ISIS and he said we shouldn't be the Air Force for him.
[00:11:49.532 --> 00:11:53.255]  Well he's come out and said that Trump's doing a lot of good
[00:11:54.582 --> 00:11:55.382]  For the economy.
[00:11:55.382 --> 00:12:05.989]  And his father was on a few weeks ago and said, no I have to say Trump's cutting regulations and trying to cut taxes is exactly what we need to get out of this recession and depression and get the big banks to give lower interest loans to the public.
[00:12:05.989 --> 00:12:12.193]  This is all so good, so wholesome, so pure, that I'm going to give you CNN having to admit it as well.
[00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:23.060]  Because the best economic numbers in 25 years just came in, not for big banks, not for the ultra-rich, but for Main Street.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.022]  Small businesses and average workers.
[00:12:27.022 --> 00:12:29.063]  Let's go to Senator Rand Paul.
[00:12:29.063 --> 00:12:31.905]  Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.
[00:12:31.905 --> 00:12:33.966]  Senator Paul, thank you for joining us.
[00:12:33.966 --> 00:12:36.368]  And I want to start with what the President said.
[00:12:36.368 --> 00:12:40.390]  A fine-tuned machine over this first month.
[00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.031]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:45.734]  Well, you know, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
[00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:49.256]  And from where I sit, we've done a lot of good things.
[00:12:49.256 --> 00:12:55.380]  You know, we've repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:02.304]  Three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs.
[00:13:02.304 --> 00:13:03.505]  That is big progress.
[00:13:03.505 --> 00:13:05.987]  We're on schedule to repeal Obamacare.
[00:13:05.987 --> 00:13:07.267]  Big progress.
[00:13:07.267 --> 00:13:11.250]  His cabinet picks, from a conservative point of view, have exceeded my expectations.
[00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.232]  I think Scott Pruitt is going to be great at EPA.
[00:13:14.232 --> 00:13:16.353]  I think we're really going to do some conservative things.
[00:13:16.353 --> 00:13:20.335]  Supreme Court Justice, I could have picked.
[00:13:20.335 --> 00:13:23.237]  So, I'm actually very, very pleased with where we are.
[00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:25.218]  Cut out a bit.
[00:13:25.218 --> 00:13:25.859]  We didn't edit that.
[00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:28.240]  It's just he said, Supreme Court pick, I would have picked.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.101]  Like, the best you could get.
[00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:34.524]  When it comes to statutory and voting and rulings and, you know, what happened.
[00:13:36.335 --> 00:13:40.916]  And I raise that because we're going into cardiac financial arrest.
[00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:44.157]  I mean, if we don't turbocharge the economy, it's game over.
[00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.398]  And the elites want that.
[00:13:45.398 --> 00:13:53.120]  They admit that they want you super poor, all the big billionaires that gave almost unanimously to Hillary and not to Trump.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.101]  No Goldman Sachs money to Trump, all the money to Hillary.
[00:13:56.101 --> 00:14:03.984]  They want an imploded economy they control, civil unrest they control and direct, so they can drive down wages.
[00:14:03.984 --> 00:14:06.645]  It came out in 2002 in the IMF and World Bank documents.
[00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:15.568]  Joseph Stiglitz, Pulitzer Prize winner, excuse me, not Pulitzer Prize winner, Nobel Prize winner for economics, came out and exposed their whole plan.
[00:14:15.568 --> 00:14:17.168]  He's a liberal!
[00:14:17.168 --> 00:14:19.329]  So they know how to make the public wealthy.
[00:14:19.329 --> 00:14:21.690]  They know how to turn the engines of wealth loose.
[00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:28.414]  The elites won't be able to consolidate control and have monopolies if they do that.
[00:14:28.414 --> 00:14:30.895]  So I went to that report.
[00:14:30.895 --> 00:14:34.137]  I want to come back before we get to more clips from Trump's latest
[00:14:35.891 --> 00:14:44.639]  Insanely good speech in Florida and get to this article that's deceptive in the headline, but everything else in CNN is true in this article.
[00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:46.301]  There's one thing going right for Trump.
[00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:48.923]  No, he's going after political correctness.
[00:14:48.923 --> 00:14:51.366]  He's following through on his promises.
[00:14:51.366 --> 00:14:53.007]  He is energizing America.
[00:14:53.007 --> 00:14:54.369]  He's creating confidence again.
[00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:56.230]  He's defending our borders.
[00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.572]  He's doing everything he said he would do.
[00:14:58.985 --> 00:15:12.536]  If they say, no, no, no, there's one thing going right, implying this is the only thing, then they list all the economic numbers and how incredibly successful Trump is at energizing the grassroots and the average person.
[00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:15.078]  So here's the deal.
[00:15:15.078 --> 00:15:23.726]  If you want to have a level playing field and to see some of the incredible wealth that civilization and human activity has available, you should back Trump.
[00:15:23.726 --> 00:15:24.967]  That's why I'm so behind him.
[00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:31.079]  Because all the big mega banks, all the power structures, they are clearly against him.
[00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:32.180]  So it's a no-brainer.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.820]  And then he's delivering.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.641]  That's why they're in panic.
[00:15:35.641 --> 00:15:46.786]  But it's a smaller and smaller elite group that are openly opposing Trump because others are just seeing the stock market explode, all this prosperity, and they're saying, why are we in the way of this?
[00:15:46.786 --> 00:15:55.010]  The truth is, globalists, with their eugenics and their austerity, had to really whip everybody into submission to something that's always been incredibly unpopular.
[00:15:57.947 --> 00:16:01.128]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:03.488]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.
[00:16:03.488 --> 00:16:10.490]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:15.812]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanse is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:16:15.812 --> 00:16:24.794]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:34.099]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:41.204]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spike GX herbal processing technique.
[00:16:41.204 --> 00:16:46.587]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price.
[00:16:46.807 --> 00:16:53.773]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:18.269]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:17:18.269 --> 00:17:20.830]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.551]  It helps detoxify.
[00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:25.431]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:30.213]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:17:30.213 --> 00:17:34.334]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:41.879]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:17:41.879 --> 00:17:43.500]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.480]  This is so key.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.823]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:17:48.823 --> 00:17:51.044]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:17:51.044 --> 00:17:54.506]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:17:58.356 --> 00:17:59.177]  Hey, everyone!
[00:17:59.177 --> 00:18:01.458]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:18:01.458 --> 00:18:05.321]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:18:05.321 --> 00:18:07.383]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:18:07.383 --> 00:18:17.671]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:23.656]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:18:24.116 --> 00:18:39.053]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:18:39.073 --> 00:18:39.513]  Thank you.
[00:18:58.214 --> 00:19:02.376]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:05.138]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[00:19:05.138 --> 00:19:06.658]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[00:19:06.658 --> 00:19:10.900]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.702]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[00:19:14.702 --> 00:19:16.383]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[00:19:16.383 --> 00:19:17.944]  It's gonna be coming out of your gun.
[00:19:17.944 --> 00:19:18.344]  Oh yeah!
[00:19:18.344 --> 00:19:20.485]  I'll tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[00:19:20.485 --> 00:19:21.126]  At all.
[00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:22.166]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:24.567]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[00:19:24.567 --> 00:19:25.268]  They lost.
[00:19:25.828 --> 00:19:26.548]  Day one.
[00:19:26.548 --> 00:19:28.729]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[00:19:28.729 --> 00:19:30.049]  It's time to ride, boss.
[00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:31.989]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[00:19:31.989 --> 00:19:38.031]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[00:19:38.031 --> 00:19:40.391]  And beef was for supper.
[00:19:40.391 --> 00:19:42.992]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[00:19:42.992 --> 00:19:44.813]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[00:19:44.813 --> 00:19:46.333]  DVDs now available.
[00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:50.654]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[00:19:51.034 --> 00:19:54.397]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[00:19:54.397 --> 00:19:56.739]  RevelationsTheMovie.info.
[00:19:56.739 --> 00:20:02.404]  Let's fix it!
[00:20:02.404 --> 00:20:09.931]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:09.931 --> 00:20:15.016]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:16.727 --> 00:20:17.609]  It's Sunday, February 19th, 2017.
[00:20:17.609 --> 00:20:18.291]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:18.631]  We've got...
[00:20:23.928 --> 00:20:38.534]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's got huge sources in D.C., have discovered that it is actually Islamicists, not just collaborators, that are trying to bring down Trump right now, but an actual Islamic invasion and infiltration through Brennan and others in our government.
[00:20:38.534 --> 00:20:40.955]  That is exclusive intel coming up.
[00:20:40.955 --> 00:20:46.158]  Owen Schroyer just landed from the incredible live Trump
[00:20:47.065 --> 00:20:48.365]  The enemy knows, believe me.
[00:20:48.365 --> 00:20:49.085]  It is the spirit.
[00:20:49.085 --> 00:20:49.466]  It's here.
[00:20:49.466 --> 00:20:49.706]  It's real.
[00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:17.537]  And we're committed to it.
[00:21:17.537 --> 00:21:19.122]  Christ is the fulcrum.
[00:21:19.122 --> 00:21:20.186]  God is the Father.
[00:21:20.186 --> 00:21:22.514]  The Holy Spirit is the delivery system.
[00:21:24.056 --> 00:21:28.777]  I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to, but here's Trump attacks the bias of the enemy media.
[00:21:28.777 --> 00:21:31.798]  But first, this is history happening.
[00:21:31.798 --> 00:21:33.319]  They've always bullied the president.
[00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:36.160]  They've always bullied the government to make them submit to the globalists.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.721]  They've always bullied us with the power of the corporate press that would attack anybody.
[00:21:40.721 --> 00:21:42.082]  Now they're on the hot seat.
[00:21:42.082 --> 00:21:43.262]  Now they're imploding.
[00:21:43.262 --> 00:21:44.843]  Now they're being exposed.
[00:21:44.843 --> 00:21:48.744]  Here is President, remember that, President Trump, number 45.
[00:21:48.744 --> 00:21:52.225]  I also want to speak to you
[00:21:53.331 --> 00:22:03.814]  Without the filter of the fake news.
[00:22:03.814 --> 00:22:11.017]  The dishonest media, which has published one false story after another.
[00:22:11.017 --> 00:22:12.157]  Extreme media.
[00:22:12.157 --> 00:22:18.099]  With no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases.
[00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:26.936]  They just don't want to report the truth, and they've been calling us wrong now for two years.
[00:22:26.936 --> 00:22:29.858]  They don't get it, but they're starting to get it.
[00:22:29.858 --> 00:22:30.498]  I can tell you.
[00:22:30.498 --> 00:22:31.098]  It's called defeat.
[00:22:31.098 --> 00:22:32.499]  He lost trying to show the primary.
[00:22:32.499 --> 00:22:33.559]  He lost his general election.
[00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:37.781]  They've become a big part of the problem.
[00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:40.382]  They are part of the corrupt system.
[00:22:40.382 --> 00:22:47.886]  Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln, and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media
[00:22:48.604 --> 00:22:49.184]  That's right.
[00:22:49.184 --> 00:22:51.345]  In fact, Thomas Jefferson said,
[00:23:16.778 --> 00:23:22.345]  Nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper.
[00:23:22.345 --> 00:23:28.872]  Truth itself, he said, becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle.
[00:23:28.872 --> 00:23:29.433]  That's right.
[00:23:29.433 --> 00:23:32.937]  That was June 14th, my birthday.
[00:23:32.937 --> 00:23:35.340]  They only mixed in a little truth to the convention.
[00:23:37.935 --> 00:23:45.560]  But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.221]  They will not defeat us.
[00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:49.143]  And they could not defeat us in the general election.
[00:23:49.143 --> 00:23:49.783]  We've broken them.
[00:23:49.783 --> 00:23:59.490]  And we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.
[00:24:00.751 --> 00:24:01.231]  That's right.
[00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:01.991]  We're not losers.
[00:24:01.991 --> 00:24:03.052]  We're Americans.
[00:24:03.052 --> 00:24:03.932]  We're not broke back.
[00:24:03.932 --> 00:24:04.912]  Get ready.
[00:24:04.912 --> 00:24:05.933]  We discovered the birthright.
[00:24:05.933 --> 00:24:12.394]  We're not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe.
[00:24:12.394 --> 00:24:18.836]  Notice we are free and independent people and we will make our own choices.
[00:24:18.836 --> 00:24:20.337]  That's right.
[00:24:20.337 --> 00:24:22.737]  Notice he used the term fake news for decades.
[00:24:22.737 --> 00:24:26.899]  Today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
[00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:28.019]  I hear your demands.
[00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:33.573]  I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver.
[00:24:33.573 --> 00:24:35.895]  I promise that.
[00:24:35.895 --> 00:24:36.596]  He's doing it.
[00:24:36.596 --> 00:24:37.917]  It's unbelievable.
[00:24:37.917 --> 00:24:38.237]  Wow!
[00:24:38.237 --> 00:24:47.045]  Imagine somebody not thinking the public's a bunch of idiots trying to screw him over because you're an elite, you're on a power trip, you're blind to the truth of empowering humanity and interfacing with it.
[00:24:47.045 --> 00:24:53.690]  We're countering the globalist communist system that basically hijacked America with a bunch of elites trying to control us.
[00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.212]  And Trump is delivering on every front.
[00:24:57.881 --> 00:24:59.466]  And the elites are in total panic.
[00:24:59.466 --> 00:25:01.753]  I want to go to one more clip before we go to break here.
[00:25:01.753 --> 00:25:02.737]  Let's go to Melania.
[00:25:02.737 --> 00:25:03.820]  This made him really upset.
[00:25:06.721 --> 00:25:11.125]  She says, uh, Lord's Prayer, and then Trump just says, wow, didn't know you were going to do that, but it was amazing.
[00:25:11.125 --> 00:25:13.508]  And the media was like, oh, Trump didn't like the Lord's Prayer.
[00:25:13.508 --> 00:25:15.089]  He said, oh, I didn't know you were going to do that.
[00:25:15.089 --> 00:25:15.950]  That was great.
[00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.331]  He was just like, oh, that was spontaneous.
[00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:17.972]  Wonderful.
[00:25:17.972 --> 00:25:18.773]  He says, wonderful.
[00:25:18.773 --> 00:25:20.735]  Like, oh, Trump isn't a Christian.
[00:25:20.735 --> 00:25:22.656]  Then the other group's attacking her for being religious.
[00:25:22.656 --> 00:25:24.218]  It's called free speech.
[00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:25.399]  Get used to it.
[00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:27.541]  Let's go to the amazing.
[00:25:27.541 --> 00:25:30.064]  Trump's so amazing, and it's just like, Melania's amazing.
[00:25:30.064 --> 00:25:31.105]  Let's just admit it's amazing.
[00:25:32.196 --> 00:25:38.198]  Hillary and the Clintons and Obama and Bush, amazingly disgusting and fake and evil.
[00:25:38.198 --> 00:25:40.678]  The Trumps, amazingly real.
[00:25:40.678 --> 00:25:47.000]  Out for the people, tied into the power source of humanity and God, ready to defend.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.981]  Compared to the enemy, it's like day and night.
[00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:52.482]  Here they are.
[00:25:52.482 --> 00:25:52.942]  Thank you.
[00:25:52.942 --> 00:25:56.323]  Let us pray.
[00:25:56.323 --> 00:26:00.744]  Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name.
[00:26:01.562 --> 00:26:06.897]  When kingdom come, they will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:30.372]  Give us these days our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for time is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever amen
[00:26:32.452 --> 00:26:35.593]  You see her channeling God's energy right there.
[00:26:35.593 --> 00:26:37.353]  The elite are in full panic.
[00:26:37.353 --> 00:26:40.074]  These are people that are pro-human, they're not perfect.
[00:26:40.074 --> 00:26:59.140]  Imagine all they've gone through, all they've been persecuted with, and now it drove them even more into God's arms, and the crowd lifting up their hands in praise to God in glory, and not being selfish, not being humanistic, not being satanic, and just saying, we want to be good, we want trailblaze, we want to be strong!
[00:27:00.589 --> 00:27:02.691]  And the enemy is just, what are we gonna do?
[00:27:02.691 --> 00:27:04.433]  And the financial numbers come in.
[00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:08.777]  We turn back to God in 32 days.
[00:27:08.777 --> 00:27:12.420]  More success in small business than we've had in 25 years.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.841]  I'm gonna cover it after break.
[00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:15.042]  I'm gonna give you the financial numbers.
[00:27:15.042 --> 00:27:16.323]  Guys, it's not your fault.
[00:27:16.323 --> 00:27:21.789]  I printed this at home, and it printed it so light in the links that I can't read my whole article.
[00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:23.790]  I know I read it at home today.
[00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.252]  Somebody print this for me, maybe in color.
[00:27:26.368 --> 00:27:28.469]  It's a, there's one thing going right for Trump.
[00:27:28.469 --> 00:27:30.450]  No, everything's going right for Trump.
[00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.290]  He's on the right side of history.
[00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.431]  And it's just, it's hard for me to read this.
[00:27:33.431 --> 00:27:35.472]  I want to read the whole article.
[00:27:35.472 --> 00:27:38.213]  I want to come back and read it because, or just read it for yourselves.
[00:27:38.213 --> 00:27:40.374]  It's just, it's just, it's just incredible.
[00:27:40.374 --> 00:27:48.617]  There's a little attack at the end, but they just admit the best consumer numbers, the best small business numbers, the best minority business numbers.
[00:27:48.617 --> 00:27:49.938]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[00:27:49.938 --> 00:27:52.099]  I mean, he, and people are saying it's kind of racist.
[00:27:53.132 --> 00:27:57.574]  They've already looked at a map, I meant to print that, of like where a lot of the factors are going.
[00:27:57.574 --> 00:28:01.715]  It's like old, falling apart, mainly black areas.
[00:28:01.715 --> 00:28:05.816]  Well, Trump's like actually not trying to just put you on welfare, he's trying to actually put factories in there.
[00:28:05.816 --> 00:28:07.957]  So people are going, wait, this is just for black people?
[00:28:07.957 --> 00:28:19.341]  Well, no, he's trying to absolutely take a group controlled by the globalists, socially engineered to be kept by them and just hit them with so much prosperity, there's just nothing they can do.
[00:28:19.341 --> 00:28:20.441]  But just break out of it.
[00:28:20.441 --> 00:28:21.882]  Trump gets the whole paradigm.
[00:28:22.978 --> 00:28:24.218]  We're going to go to break here in a moment.
[00:28:24.218 --> 00:28:26.399]  Infowars.com is the website.
[00:28:26.399 --> 00:28:27.380]  We're all over the news.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.101]  Hundreds of newspapers a day attack us, literally.
[00:28:30.101 --> 00:28:31.041]  They want to shut us down.
[00:28:31.041 --> 00:28:34.682]  There's big articles in the New York Times tomorrow basically calling for us to be shut down.
[00:28:34.682 --> 00:28:37.743]  And it's okay because I've already sent my transmission.
[00:28:37.743 --> 00:28:41.665]  I want to continue on, but it's almost like I throw myself so into this that
[00:28:42.626 --> 00:28:43.387]  I don't want to die.
[00:28:43.387 --> 00:28:48.135]  I never commit suicide, but if they destroy me, it's almost like they've done me a favor.
[00:28:48.135 --> 00:28:52.162]  But the point is, they don't want the articles going out in the video, so spread those links.
[00:28:52.162 --> 00:28:53.364]  InfoWars.com.
[00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:53.845]  We'll be back.

[00:30:48.963 --> 00:30:49.783]  10% off on auto ship.

[00:30:52.365 --> 00:30:54.367]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[00:30:54.367 --> 00:30:58.771]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[00:30:58.771 --> 00:31:00.613]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:31:00.613 --> 00:31:07.219]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:31:07.219 --> 00:31:08.660]  We are now introducing cavemen.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.400]  Caveman.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:17.602]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:31:28.465 --> 00:31:31.627]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:31:31.627 --> 00:31:36.770]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:44.916]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:31:44.916 --> 00:31:52.861]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:31:52.861 --> 00:31:57.524]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.082]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:32:00.082 --> 00:32:02.184]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:32:02.184 --> 00:32:05.086]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:32:05.086 --> 00:32:11.151]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:32:11.151 --> 00:32:20.360]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:25.204]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:32:25.424 --> 00:32:27.868]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:32:27.868 --> 00:32:35.899]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:32:35.899 --> 00:32:36.880]  The general public doesn't.
[00:32:38.084 --> 00:32:42.026]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:45.587]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:32:45.587 --> 00:32:52.310]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:32:52.310 --> 00:33:01.874]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[00:33:01.874 --> 00:33:04.515]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.784 --> 00:33:33.121]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:33.121 --> 00:33:34.785]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:39.525 --> 00:33:44.388]  As I've told you over and over again, the globalist-run corporate media are collaborators.
[00:33:44.388 --> 00:33:46.169]  They're enemies of the people.
[00:33:46.169 --> 00:33:46.930]  That isn't rhetoric.
[00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:50.252]  They are actual enemies of the people.
[00:33:50.252 --> 00:33:54.655]  And now President Trump is openly exposing them for their deception.
[00:33:54.655 --> 00:33:57.777]  There's massive new jobs for the average worker.
[00:33:57.777 --> 00:34:01.479]  The working class, the blue collar, the middle class explode.
[00:34:01.479 --> 00:34:02.560]  They are in full panic.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.463]  I want to go to more clips from the historic speech yesterday in Melbourne, Florida with President Trump.
[00:34:07.463 --> 00:34:07.863]  But first,
[00:34:10.981 --> 00:34:16.043]  Let's get into this article from CNN itself having to admit the truth.
[00:34:16.043 --> 00:34:17.724]  There's one thing going right for Trump.
[00:34:17.724 --> 00:34:19.964]  Again, everything's going right for him.
[00:34:19.964 --> 00:34:29.108]  Exposing political correctness, the globalists, the crony capitalists, pick winners and losers, how to empower the economy, how to grow ourselves out of this depression.
[00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:30.468]  But they say, oh, one thing.
[00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:34.950]  Well, if the one thing is the economy and delivering on your promises, then that's everything.
[00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:39.719]  Headlines claim the White House is in chaos after an extremely turbulent week.
[00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.182]  But there's one big thing going right for Trump right now, the U.S.
[00:34:43.182 --> 00:34:44.023]  economy.
[00:34:44.023 --> 00:34:46.945]  A slew of economic data came out this week, almost all of it positive.
[00:34:46.945 --> 00:34:50.088]  Americans are going to the stores and spending big.
[00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:53.171]  Retail sales came in better than expected for January.
[00:34:53.171 --> 00:34:55.774]  There's also buying houses and cars and using their credit cards.
[00:34:56.624 --> 00:35:00.526]  On top of all that, small and medium businesses owners are getting.
[00:35:00.526 --> 00:35:08.151]  The NFIB, Small Business Optimism Index, is at the highest level since 2004, 14 years ago, or 13 years ago.
[00:35:08.151 --> 00:35:16.255]  Heck, even manufacturing has made a pretty big turnaround and looks almost healthy again.
[00:35:16.255 --> 00:35:21.618]  The Philly Fed Index, a survey of how well manufacturers are doing, just hit its highest level since 1984.
[00:35:23.404 --> 00:35:25.525]  There's that 20-plus number I gave you.
[00:35:25.525 --> 00:35:28.107]  And anyone with money in the market likely noticed the U.S.
[00:35:28.107 --> 00:35:30.749]  stock market set even more records this week.
[00:35:30.749 --> 00:35:38.794]  In fact, American stocks are at their best winning streak in 25 years, at $2.5 trillion gained in two months.
[00:35:39.824 --> 00:35:47.889]  There's still a belief on Wall Street and many parts of Main Street that CNN money has recently visited, that the Trump is going to get the economy surging again.
[00:35:47.889 --> 00:35:49.389]  Yes, there are some red flags.
[00:35:49.389 --> 00:35:52.791]  Household debt is back to the 2008 levels and prices are rising.
[00:35:52.791 --> 00:35:53.952]  But overall, things look good.
[00:35:53.952 --> 00:36:01.476]  The economy is better than you think, says Chris Rubke, Chief Economic Economist at the MFUG Union Bank in New York.
[00:36:01.476 --> 00:36:06.499]  President Trump has inherited the best economy since President Bush, so let's hope things continue to run smoothly.
[00:36:06.499 --> 00:36:07.780]  Now that's CNN's BS.
[00:36:10.489 --> 00:36:17.092]  The globalists admit that they've kept interest rates low for the big banks to get 0%, but not to the public.
[00:36:17.092 --> 00:36:25.496]  There's been historically, in the last 200 years, low levels of loans to the general public and small businesses.
[00:36:25.496 --> 00:36:27.577]  That's why Trump's getting rid of Yellen.
[00:36:27.577 --> 00:36:31.018]  He's firing the Federal Reserve, which is private, but he can control it.
[00:36:31.018 --> 00:36:33.359]  So we always say it's private, but it did have government control.
[00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:34.680]  The government would just never exercise it.
[00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:38.836]  So technically you could say it had government control, but they never exercised it.
[00:36:38.836 --> 00:36:41.677]  Now Trump's like, listen up.
[00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:58.947]  I'm somebody that isn't for low interest rates usually, but since you've had it for yourself for eight, nine years, you're going to give it for at least a year to the general public at 0%, so they get it at 2% or 3% after the local bank loans it, the local bank gets interest, then it builds local community, and so does the public.
[00:36:58.947 --> 00:36:59.888]  You're going to do that.
[00:37:03.226 --> 00:37:09.070]  Again, everything Trump's doing, like Ron Paul and Rand Paul, they both were Trump enemies.
[00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:18.137]  But because they care about the people, and they're both economists and informed, both into the economics, they've come out and said, okay, Trump's amazing on the economy.
[00:37:18.137 --> 00:37:19.738]  Okay, he's trying to save us.
[00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:20.959]  And if we don't do this, we're crazy.
[00:37:20.959 --> 00:37:29.645]  So just understand, Trump is doing everything he can to turn back our coal plants, to cut our corporate taxes, to bring jobs back, to
[00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:32.407]  Rand Paul said he's got 10,000 jobs.
[00:37:32.407 --> 00:37:34.528]  It's hundreds of thousands of jobs have already been announced.
[00:37:34.528 --> 00:37:36.849]  Hundreds of billions of jobs have been announced.
[00:37:36.849 --> 00:37:42.692]  It's so good, it's hard to even gauge it all.
[00:37:42.692 --> 00:37:43.092]  Look at this.
[00:37:43.092 --> 00:37:43.392]  U.S.
[00:37:43.392 --> 00:37:49.615]  Economic Conference surges to the highest level that Gallup has ever recorded.
[00:37:49.615 --> 00:37:50.976]  I mean, it's all right here.
[00:37:50.976 --> 00:37:53.777]  Meanwhile, Trump calls the news media the enemy of the American people.
[00:37:53.777 --> 00:37:54.938]  Yeah, they want a monopoly.
[00:37:54.938 --> 00:37:57.299]  Fed to raise rates to challenge and block Trump.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:04.683]  Washington Post called on the Russian government payroll against Trump.
[00:38:04.683 --> 00:38:16.628]  Trump understands that he has a service-based company, the Trump operation, and that it's not been as profitable the last decade because the economy's been imploding and the winners and losers have been picked.
[00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:20.669]  So Trump, just from a selfish view, wants prosperity.
[00:38:20.669 --> 00:38:22.030]  He has a service-based company.
[00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:29.137]  Oh, and Schreuer is with us in the next hour after Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us with breaking news.
[00:38:29.137 --> 00:38:35.200]  Was just in Melbourne, Florida yesterday to cover this, and we have video of liberals just going, he's rich, he wants us to be poor, he's rich.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.781]  No, he's the blue-collar billionaire.
[00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:45.905]  All the other big billionaires, except for like Peter Thiel, maybe Musk, say we should empower people and cut taxes and have a big economy.
[00:38:45.905 --> 00:38:52.308]  So a handful of 300, 400 billionaires is for the people, all the rest are against you, and Trump is that.
[00:38:53.609 --> 00:38:54.470]  He's on fire!
[00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:58.254]  I mean, I don't have enough energy to give to this movement.
[00:38:58.254 --> 00:39:00.536]  It's so delicious and so real.
[00:39:00.536 --> 00:39:03.238]  We're gonna go to break here in about four minutes, but I want to go ahead and play another clip.
[00:39:04.176 --> 00:39:07.619]  And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement, they stood up big.
[00:39:07.619 --> 00:39:08.219]  I don't say for me.
[00:39:08.219 --> 00:39:08.940]  I'm the messenger, folks.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.320]  I'm the messenger.
[00:39:33.812 --> 00:39:37.054]  They stood up for us in this last election.
[00:39:37.054 --> 00:39:43.439]  We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military.
[00:39:43.439 --> 00:39:45.920]  Basically, people that wear uniforms like us.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.461]  Isn't that nice?
[00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:49.883]  And I saw this man on television just now.
[00:39:49.883 --> 00:39:50.984]  You!
[00:39:50.984 --> 00:39:53.165]  I just saw him on television.
[00:39:53.165 --> 00:39:54.666]  He said, I love Trump.
[00:39:54.666 --> 00:39:56.667]  Let Trump do what he has to do.
[00:39:56.667 --> 00:39:58.028]  That's my guy right there.
[00:39:58.028 --> 00:40:03.132]  It's true.
[00:40:03.132 --> 00:40:03.412]  Come here.
[00:40:04.099 --> 00:40:05.680]  Come here.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.981]  No, I just, I'm coming in.
[00:40:06.981 --> 00:40:10.104]  That's okay, let him up, let him up.
[00:40:10.104 --> 00:40:12.365]  I'm not worried about him.
[00:40:12.365 --> 00:40:14.807]  I'm only worried he's gonna give me a kiss.
[00:40:14.807 --> 00:40:16.689]  I'm not worried about anything else.
[00:40:16.689 --> 00:40:18.090]  This guy is so great.
[00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:18.650]  So badass.
[00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:22.233]  He was one of many people, they're interviewing people in the line.
[00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:30.479]  And I have to say, there's a tiny group of protesters out there, and they were given as much publicity as this massive group of people.
[00:40:30.479 --> 00:40:32.621]  If we don't give Trump support, we deserve what we're getting.
[00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:33.482]  This is a real test.
[00:40:34.534 --> 00:40:34.914]  Come on up.
[00:40:34.914 --> 00:40:36.356]  This guy's on fire for people.
[00:40:36.356 --> 00:40:37.237]  This guy is great.
[00:40:37.237 --> 00:40:38.138]  Up over the fence.
[00:40:38.138 --> 00:40:38.879]  Come on.
[00:40:38.879 --> 00:40:39.980]  He can do it.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.181]  He's so manly.
[00:40:41.181 --> 00:40:42.102]  Like making a joke.
[00:40:42.102 --> 00:40:43.143]  This guy's gonna give me a kiss.
[00:40:43.143 --> 00:40:43.944]  Like brotherly love.
[00:40:43.944 --> 00:40:44.565]  It's like.
[00:40:44.565 --> 00:40:45.186]  Come on.
[00:40:45.186 --> 00:40:46.887]  The average wimpy guy would say something like that.
[00:40:46.887 --> 00:40:47.788]  This guy is great.
[00:40:47.788 --> 00:40:49.290]  Don't worry about him.
[00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:51.973]  No, no, no, no.
[00:40:51.973 --> 00:40:52.834]  Come here.
[00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:53.675]  Come on up.
[00:40:53.675 --> 00:40:54.215]  Come on.
[00:40:54.215 --> 00:40:54.476]  Come here.
[00:40:58.496 --> 00:41:00.057]  It's about the people!
[00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:00.757]  This guy!
[00:41:00.757 --> 00:41:03.979]  About the robots, and all your crap.
[00:41:03.979 --> 00:41:11.842]  So, he's been all over television, saying the best things, and I see him standing, and didn't you get here like at 4 in the morning?
[00:41:11.842 --> 00:41:12.402]  I did, sir.
[00:41:12.402 --> 00:41:15.024]  Say a couple of words to this crowd.
[00:41:15.024 --> 00:41:19.706]  Doesn't know what he's gonna say, puts him on TV, it's the, it's not recklessness, it's the spirit.
[00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:21.126]  Mr. President!
[00:41:21.126 --> 00:41:21.727]  Thank you, sir.
[00:41:22.722 --> 00:41:31.447]  We the people, all movement, is the reason why our President of the United States is standing here in front of us today.
[00:41:31.447 --> 00:41:32.267]  Yes.
[00:41:32.267 --> 00:41:33.228]  Yes.
[00:41:33.228 --> 00:41:33.928]  We're connected.
[00:41:33.928 --> 00:41:34.308]  That's it.
[00:41:34.308 --> 00:41:35.809]  This is real, folks.
[00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:36.549]  This is history.
[00:41:36.549 --> 00:41:39.231]  There's no... My spirit, my gut, it's real.
[00:41:39.231 --> 00:41:40.331]  It's unbelievable.
[00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:48.216]  When President Trump, during their election, promised all these things that he was going to do for us... He's doing it!
[00:41:48.216 --> 00:41:49.857]  I knew he was going to do this for us.
[00:41:49.857 --> 00:41:50.357]  That's right!
[00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:53.546]  Because that's history!
[00:41:53.546 --> 00:41:59.369]  Where are the real leaders that get it?
[00:41:59.369 --> 00:42:01.411]  A star is born.
[00:42:01.411 --> 00:42:02.571]  A star is born.
[00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:03.672]  Boom.
[00:42:03.672 --> 00:42:06.774]  The people.
[00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:08.415]  And the numbers.
[00:42:08.415 --> 00:42:11.937]  And then Goldman Sachs gave 100% of its money to Hillary, trying to block him.
[00:42:11.937 --> 00:42:14.739]  Their stock's up 33, 35%.
[00:42:14.739 --> 00:42:16.100]  And they're still bitching.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.962]  He's like, because see, they don't want you to have any wealth.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.600]  Trump's smart.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.182]  He's not trying to take the wealth from the globalists that stole it because they'd be too big a fight.
[00:42:24.182 --> 00:42:26.322]  He's just like, look, you're done, vampires.
[00:42:26.322 --> 00:42:27.103]  Get off the people.
[00:42:27.103 --> 00:42:28.543]  Just get off of them.
[00:42:28.543 --> 00:42:30.044]  We're going to get them some.
[00:42:30.044 --> 00:42:31.284]  No, get off.
[00:42:31.284 --> 00:42:32.324]  Keep the stuff you stole.
[00:42:32.324 --> 00:42:33.305]  Just go.
[00:42:33.305 --> 00:42:34.785]  They're like, no.
[00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:35.726]  He's like, here's all this money.
[00:42:35.726 --> 00:42:36.366]  Boom.
[00:42:36.366 --> 00:42:37.246]  They still want more.
[00:42:37.246 --> 00:42:38.407]  Like, just let him have something.
[00:42:38.407 --> 00:42:43.228]  He's like trying to hold vampires off while trying to like get emergency resuscitation to the people.
[00:42:43.228 --> 00:42:44.649]  Let me tell you, once he gets resuscitated,
[00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.792]  We globalists better watch their ass.
[00:42:47.792 --> 00:42:50.154]  If they'd have backed off, Trump wouldn't have run over them.
[00:42:50.154 --> 00:42:56.179]  But believe me, a couple years from now, you watch, once we get the country back, and the world back, the new world order is in deep crap.
[00:42:57.981 --> 00:43:12.325]  President Donald Trump stepped up his attack on the fake news network, CNN, during a press conference yesterday, telling reporter Jim Acosta that he had downgraded their title from fake news to very fake news.
[00:43:12.325 --> 00:43:18.627]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir... I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[00:43:18.627 --> 00:43:20.328]  Doesn't that under-variate fake news?
[00:43:20.328 --> 00:43:21.108]  I know, but aren't you...
[00:43:23.371 --> 00:43:37.738]  Acosta then went on to ask President Trump, aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in the country when you're calling stories you don't like fake news?
[00:43:37.738 --> 00:43:38.679]  No, Acosta.
[00:43:39.039 --> 00:43:53.477]  The only ones that are undermining the American people's faith in the press are fake news outlets like you guys at CNN that constantly push this narrative that somehow President Donald Trump is working for the Russians.

[00:49:58.508 --> 00:50:03.510]  Here's where Trump declares victory over the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:09.132]  It was ratified bipartisanly, secretly, over 10 years, but never even shown to Congress.
[00:50:09.132 --> 00:50:12.133]  And when we finally got a copy, it takes over everything.
[00:50:12.133 --> 00:50:14.534]  This is the corporate takeover that we were already there.
[00:50:14.534 --> 00:50:16.754]  It's not that we're just lucky to have Trump.
[00:50:16.754 --> 00:50:18.375]  It was key that this came along now.
[00:50:19.753 --> 00:50:24.317]  I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job-killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:55.435]  TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it.
[00:50:55.435 --> 00:51:03.720]  We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or, as we would say, one-on-one.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:13.626]  None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand, where we get mired in and we can't do anything about it, like, by the way, NAFTA and so many others.
[00:51:14.318 --> 00:51:28.999]  And my administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation, which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers.
[00:51:28.999 --> 00:51:29.700]  We're going to end it.
[00:51:31.698 --> 00:51:33.438]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:51:33.438 --> 00:51:40.780]  What do you think would happen if there was an American president that hadn't been bought off and wasn't selling out a tremendous wealth and power?
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:59.345]  What do you think the foreign banks, the international media, the big universities, the corporate elites, the foreign governments, the power structures, the controlled religions, what would they do against somebody who came in after they'd conquered a country and after they were looting it and subdividing it and draining it?
[00:52:00.925 --> 00:52:01.865]  What would they do?
[00:52:01.865 --> 00:52:04.306]  Would they battle somebody that helped them?
[00:52:04.306 --> 00:52:06.787]  Who was a globalist?
[00:52:06.787 --> 00:52:11.689]  Or would they go along with it?
[00:52:11.689 --> 00:52:18.412]  No, the answer is they would battle someone that wasn't going along with them.
[00:52:18.412 --> 00:52:24.915]  And Trump has all these horrible enemies that just show you that he's for real.
[00:52:24.915 --> 00:52:27.216]  And I saw that, knew that, and my gut told me that.
[00:52:27.216 --> 00:52:28.997]  But now, 32 days in,
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:36.483]  Stock market, two trillion plus billion.
[00:52:36.483 --> 00:52:38.965]  I think it's like 2.5 now.
[00:52:38.965 --> 00:52:48.511]  And hundreds of billions of jobs, hundreds of billions of dollars in jobs, hundreds of thousands of jobs coming back.
[00:52:48.511 --> 00:52:50.212]  It's so good I'm pinching myself.
[00:52:50.212 --> 00:52:53.795]  I'm like, man, you're always right.
[00:52:53.795 --> 00:52:57.557]  I'm not an arrogant person, but I was always right growing up.
[00:52:57.557 --> 00:52:59.358]  I always made good decisions.
[00:52:59.358 --> 00:52:59.739]  I always,
[00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:01.711]  Was successful.
[00:53:01.711 --> 00:53:02.451]  I had discernment.
[00:53:02.451 --> 00:53:03.252]  I had the birthright.
[00:53:03.252 --> 00:53:08.056]  I had... I guess what the Calvinists talk about.
[00:53:08.056 --> 00:53:11.860]  And, you know, there's Trump saying, take the birthright.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.901]  Accept it.
[00:53:12.901 --> 00:53:14.222]  Be successful.
[00:53:14.222 --> 00:53:15.263]  Let us empower you.
[00:53:15.263 --> 00:53:16.384]  It'll empower everybody else.
[00:53:16.384 --> 00:53:19.226]  And the whole media is saying, no, no, no.
[00:53:19.226 --> 00:53:20.007]  You can't have that.
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.441]  But the whole globalist media is against him.
[00:53:23.441 --> 00:53:25.622]  All these power structures are against him.
[00:53:25.622 --> 00:53:26.983]  Does that tell you he's good or bad?
[00:53:26.983 --> 00:53:30.405]  Well, generally, he must be good, but let's see what he does.
[00:53:30.405 --> 00:53:42.392]  He gets in and does all this fair, good stuff, militarily, economically, nationally, and then it's just like, whoa, this is so good.
[00:53:42.392 --> 00:53:43.853]  This is so precious.
[00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:46.014]  I want to work 20 hours a day to defend this.
[00:53:48.032 --> 00:53:51.784]  And then it's like the Twilight Zone, that I talk to this guy, he calls me, that...
[00:53:54.821 --> 00:54:21.448]  That he talks to so many other people, that he calls widows up, or cops that die, and firefighters, you know, wives when their husband dies, and that he really, it's not a big act, but Trump, he's high on people, he's high on empowering humanity, and really is in our corner, and it's just like, you're so used to all these fake globalists and all this dishonest, empty garbage and fraud, and I'm a real person, I've been looking for that my whole life, I find it in the general public,
[00:54:22.108 --> 00:54:24.689]  I don't find it in Hollywood, the big corporate power structures.
[00:54:24.689 --> 00:54:26.611]  They're a bunch of arrogant a-holes.
[00:54:26.611 --> 00:54:28.051]  But in Trump, I find it.
[00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:30.793]  And it's like, my gut told me he was real.
[00:54:30.793 --> 00:54:32.434]  My intellect told me he was real.
[00:54:32.434 --> 00:54:34.675]  But now, none of that matters.
[00:54:34.675 --> 00:54:37.476]  He's delivering.
[00:54:37.476 --> 00:54:41.078]  And it's then just like, what?
[00:54:41.078 --> 00:54:41.819]  It happened?
[00:54:44.232 --> 00:54:46.353]  This really is happening?
[00:54:46.353 --> 00:54:53.235]  His wife's giving the Lord's Prayer, invoking God against the enemy because she knows what she's being attacked with?
[00:54:53.235 --> 00:54:58.156]  And these elites that think they control the world and it was all theirs and we were just asleep so they could run it?
[00:54:58.156 --> 00:54:59.637]  No!
[00:54:59.637 --> 00:55:01.137]  Humanity is awakening.
[00:55:01.137 --> 00:55:02.638]  If you want to fight, you got one.
[00:55:04.804 --> 00:55:09.246]  Now before I go any further, I love that they're like, oh, he's weak, he wants to talk to a crowd to feel good.
[00:55:09.246 --> 00:55:14.968]  God, I want somebody that wants to see what humanity wants, to go to a crowd to feel good, and to lean on the public's love.
[00:55:14.968 --> 00:55:17.929]  God, that sounds like somebody that's the opposite of a psychopath!
[00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:19.249]  Good Lord!
[00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:33.835]  Even though he wasn't weak, he went there to show the people, and who was important, he was up 10 points in two weeks in Gallup polls, getting everything he wanted done, after huge press conferences, huge victories, you name it, he went back to celebrate with the people.
[00:55:34.838 --> 00:55:41.664]  But even their spin is the truth because they said, oh, he needs the people, and damn right he does.
[00:55:41.664 --> 00:55:45.888]  You know, if Trump respects you and you say something to him, it hits him.
[00:55:45.888 --> 00:55:48.170]  But he thinks you're a scumbag, he doesn't care what you have to say.
[00:55:49.431 --> 00:55:55.734]  And he's not perfect, but he's a real man that wants prosperity for his women, his children, his life.
[00:55:55.734 --> 00:56:04.158]  And if he's going to have prosperity, he wants to be up there on that mountain he's on, seeing the valleys down below happy and living great lives, and other hills and mountains as well.
[00:56:04.158 --> 00:56:07.040]  And other mountains he sees, hey, I can compete with that mountain.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.281]  I don't want to blow that mountain up.
[00:56:09.281 --> 00:56:10.341]  That's a great power.
[00:56:10.341 --> 00:56:11.982]  I want to see what I can do.
[00:56:11.982 --> 00:56:14.203]  We all help each other rise.
[00:56:14.203 --> 00:56:16.484]  Trump has the human spirit.
[00:56:16.484 --> 00:56:17.465]  He has the fire.
[00:56:19.517 --> 00:56:23.180]  He is Prometheus.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.661]  You're all Prometheus.
[00:56:24.661 --> 00:56:34.108]  Some said when they were trying to kill Spartacus, the slave that revolted against the Romans, when they were trying to find him and kill him, people, everybody said, I am Spartacus.
[00:56:34.108 --> 00:56:35.189]  Well, I'm Trump.
[00:56:35.189 --> 00:56:36.150]  You want to intimidate Trump?
[00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:37.291]  You'll pull his name down?
[00:56:37.291 --> 00:56:38.171]  I'm Trump.
[00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:38.872]  I am Prometheus.
[00:56:40.162 --> 00:56:43.363]  We're going to start in a number of hours to play a clip, get our next guest in.
[00:56:43.363 --> 00:56:50.924]  A lot of breaking news in the second hour, but be part of the action against the globalist censorship, their control of the media, their manipulation.
[00:56:50.924 --> 00:56:52.604]  Expose the fake stream media.
[00:56:52.604 --> 00:56:53.505]  Get that term out there.
[00:56:53.505 --> 00:56:54.245]  That's one I've invented.
[00:56:54.245 --> 00:56:55.525]  Let's get it out there.
[00:56:55.525 --> 00:56:59.886]  Expose the globalist and support the local stations you're listening to.
[00:56:59.886 --> 00:57:02.226]  Support the local sponsors and let them know why.
[00:57:02.226 --> 00:57:04.967]  You went to their car dealership or their restaurant or their whatever it was.
[00:57:06.266 --> 00:57:11.668]  And know that we've got products at InfoWarsTore.com that are the very best.
[00:57:11.668 --> 00:57:22.412]  I bust our butt, our back, to find the best nutraceuticals, the best supplements, the best non-GMO seeds, the best t-shirts, the best lowers, everything.
[00:57:22.412 --> 00:57:23.752]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:23.752 --> 00:57:26.693]  And when you fund us, you've seen how far we've come.
[00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:30.635]  Just fund us, give us the energy, empower us, and know that you are
[00:57:32.009 --> 00:57:32.830]  Us!

[00:57:38.133 --> 00:57:41.635]  So, you've already had a big effect, but I'm ready for the next energy boost.
[00:57:41.635 --> 00:57:44.217]  I'm ready for your prayers and your financial support.
[00:57:44.217 --> 00:57:45.177]  Second hour, straight ahead.
[00:57:45.177 --> 00:57:45.558]  Stay with us.
[00:57:47.813 --> 00:57:58.663]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people the true next generation in body armor.
[00:57:58.663 --> 00:58:06.470]  Basically what we're bringing to the InfoWars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:12.395]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:58:12.475 --> 00:58:18.499]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:58:18.499 --> 00:58:19.640]  I mean, what did they really say about it?
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.462]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:58:22.462 --> 00:58:26.184]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[00:58:26.184 --> 00:58:29.126]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:58:29.126 --> 00:58:30.987]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:58:30.987 --> 00:58:32.008]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.129]  It's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:58:33.129 --> 00:58:33.809]  It's waterproof.
[00:58:33.809 --> 00:58:34.270]  You can wear it.
[00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.970]  It's comfortable.
[00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:37.091]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:58:37.091 --> 00:58:38.873]  Again, fund the Info Ward.
[00:58:38.873 --> 00:58:41.574]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes.
[00:58:41.574 --> 00:58:42.235]  It's a win-win.
[00:58:43.336 --> 00:58:43.376]  $200!
[00:58:43.376 --> 00:58:46.618]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:46.618 --> 00:58:49.220]  It's amazing.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:59.747]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:59.747 --> 00:59:05.651]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[00:59:05.651 --> 00:59:07.012]  Iodine is key.
[00:59:07.012 --> 00:59:07.733]  It's paramount.
[00:59:07.833 --> 00:59:12.875]  And there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[00:59:12.875 --> 00:59:21.820]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:25.742]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[00:59:25.742 --> 00:59:28.563]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[00:59:28.563 --> 00:59:32.625]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[00:59:33.225 --> 00:59:35.067]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:11.195 --> 01:00:17.620]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:32.591]  All right, coming up in five minutes, investigative journalist, number one New York Times bestselling author, Dr. Jerome Corsi is joining us about Islamist operatives discovered and documented inside the outgoing Obama administration just 37 days ago.
[01:00:32.591 --> 01:00:36.094]  They're trying to sabotage President Trump and his restoration of the republic.
[01:00:37.554 --> 01:00:57.967]  But Jay Sekulow, who, again, is one of the biggest conservative activists out there with Fox News, I mean, tens of millions of supporters, with a big focus on the family-type groups, he's come out and mirrored our analysis that there is a true multinational move to overthrow Trump and try to set up a, quote, soft coup.
[01:00:59.127 --> 01:01:01.609]  And that's in Soros' own words.
[01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:06.273]  So Jay Sekulow, Obama should be held accountable for the soft coup against Trump.
[01:01:06.273 --> 01:01:07.534]  And again, I mean, I'll say it.
[01:01:07.534 --> 01:01:11.457]  I have Corsi on 10 years ago.
[01:01:11.457 --> 01:01:14.080]  He talked about it's an Islamic plan to merge the left.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.361]  Well, who wrote Unholy Alliance?
[01:01:16.361 --> 01:01:17.723]  There's been so many books on the subject.
[01:01:17.723 --> 01:01:22.186]  We had a guest on Friday about how the socialists and communists emerged with Islam.
[01:01:22.186 --> 01:01:24.088]  You hear this, you think, oh, the left's not going to do that.
[01:01:24.088 --> 01:01:25.189]  That's crazy talk.
[01:01:26.785 --> 01:01:28.750]  Yeah, David Horowitz exposed it.
[01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:29.793]  And then you see it true.
[01:01:29.793 --> 01:01:32.481]  I was like, okay.
[01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:33.063]  Everybody from...
[01:01:34.485 --> 01:01:39.169]  From Dr. Corsi to Matt Drudge to David Horowitz, they're all right.
[01:01:39.169 --> 01:01:40.090]  I'm wrong.
[01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:42.412]  See, I'm the type of guy that when I'm wrong, I admit it.
[01:01:42.412 --> 01:01:48.036]  And now that I knew I was wrong, I'm fighting ten times harder because I knew Islam was radical and out of control.
[01:01:48.036 --> 01:01:48.737]  I wanted to deal with it.
[01:01:48.737 --> 01:01:50.198]  I didn't want to have a big war with it.
[01:01:50.198 --> 01:01:52.960]  I didn't realize our own governments were, like, empowering and turning it loose.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.081]  So that's all coming up.
[01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:59.426]  We're going to go to break here in a moment, but I wanted to air Jay Sekulow talking about this clear and present danger from Hannity.
[01:01:59.986 --> 01:02:05.629]  Because this really sets the table for what Dr. Corsi of Infowars.com is about to break down.
[01:02:05.629 --> 01:02:08.470]  A lightning round quick just to get facts on the table.
[01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:19.395]  The big story you agree with me is that the intelligence community has been politicized, at least among some, and what they did in leaking this information was illegal, correct?
[01:02:19.395 --> 01:02:25.317]  Absolutely illegal and almost becomes a soft coup in a sense because of the leaks that have taken place, which violate federal law, a felony.
[01:02:25.317 --> 01:02:28.338]  Okay, and that would be the Espionage Act 18 U.S.
[01:02:28.338 --> 01:02:28.699]  Code 793.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:30.500]  Correct.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.042]  That's an unauthorized dissemination of information.
[01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:33.382]  Okay.
[01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:40.708]  The other thing is, so we know that our intelligence agencies, they were doing their job and they were monitoring a Russian ambassador.
[01:02:40.708 --> 01:02:41.088]  Right.
[01:02:41.088 --> 01:02:50.976]  There is law and protocol, I want you to go into more detail here, where when they discover that an American is being spoken to with the person that they've targeted for surveillance,
[01:02:51.716 --> 01:02:59.603]  That if they don't have a warrant, they're supposed to stop recording, minimize what they hear from the American citizen.
[01:02:59.603 --> 01:03:02.666]  In this case, it would be General Flynn, so that makes it illegal.
[01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:03.787]  Right, he was a private citizen at the time.
[01:03:03.787 --> 01:03:04.128]  Explain.
[01:03:04.128 --> 01:03:05.769]  Right, so it's called minimization.
[01:03:05.769 --> 01:03:07.931]  It's a requirement under the law.
[01:03:07.931 --> 01:03:14.157]  When you find out that there's an American, you don't have a wiretap exactly what you said, you basically shut it off for their portion of the conversation.
[01:03:14.617 --> 01:03:30.988]  But Sean, there was a sea change here in the NSA, with an order that came out from President Obama, 17 days before he left office, where he allowed the NSA, who used to control the data, it now goes to 16 other agencies, and that just festered this whole leaking situation.
[01:03:30.988 --> 01:03:34.291]  And that happened on the way out, as the President was leaving the office.
[01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:35.311]  Hold that thought.
[01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:36.332]  No, because this is important.
[01:03:36.332 --> 01:03:37.453]  I want you to stay on this.
[01:03:37.453 --> 01:03:41.816]  Let me put up the New York Times, this is from January 12th, discussing this very thing that you said.
[01:03:42.376 --> 01:03:57.835]  In its final days, the Obama administration expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government's 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections.
[01:03:58.656 --> 01:04:00.998]  Let's explain the severity of this.
[01:04:00.998 --> 01:04:08.044]  This means that information that most people would never see is now spread all throughout the entire intelligence community.
[01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:08.905]  Explain the significance of that.
[01:04:08.905 --> 01:04:16.351]  Well, the first question I ask is why did the Obama administration wait until they had 17 days left in their administration to put this order in place if they thought it was so important they had eight years?
[01:04:16.351 --> 01:04:16.951]  They didn't do it.
[01:04:16.951 --> 01:04:17.832]  That's number one.
[01:04:18.252 --> 01:04:27.814]  Number two, it changed the existing rules, which was an executive order dating back to Ronald Reagan, that has been in place until 17 days before the Obama administration was going to end.
[01:04:27.814 --> 01:04:31.435]  That said, the NSA gets the raw data and they determine dissemination.
[01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:40.877]  Instead, this change that the president put in place, signed off by the way by James Clapper on December 15th, 2016, signed off by Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General, January 3rd, 2017.
[01:04:43.397 --> 01:04:50.929]  They decide that now, all of a sudden, six agencies, uh, 16 agencies can get the raw data, and what that does is it almost creates a shadow government.
[01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:56.057]  You have all these people that are not agreeing with the president, President Trump's position, so it just vectors more people.
[01:04:56.057 --> 01:04:56.437]  That's right.
[01:04:56.437 --> 01:04:56.978]  We'll be back.
[01:04:56.978 --> 01:04:57.359]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:02.015]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[01:06:03.737 --> 01:06:10.603]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:06:10.603 --> 01:06:19.411]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[01:06:19.411 --> 01:06:22.093]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:23.706 --> 01:06:30.109]  That's right on the journey to hell under globalism, or a lot better if we follow Christ and basic freedom.
[01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:32.390]  All right, Dr. Drew, of course, he joins us in the next two segments.
[01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:34.632]  Infowars.com, Washington Bureau Chief.
[01:06:34.632 --> 01:06:39.534]  This week I got to sign some leases and actually get office space there, and he's going to start hiring crew and all the great work he's doing.
[01:06:39.534 --> 01:06:40.975]  I talked to the New York Times today.
[01:06:40.975 --> 01:06:42.756]  They're like, yeah, we called the White House.
[01:06:42.756 --> 01:06:44.296]  Where's your press conference?
[01:06:44.296 --> 01:06:45.697]  Where's your press credentials?
[01:06:45.697 --> 01:06:46.818]  They said you never asked for them.
[01:06:47.338 --> 01:06:50.480]  You're going to be giving them basically, so I'm dealing with all this weirdness.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:56.663]  But it just shows the internal war where Rex Tillerson is being ignored at State Department.
[01:06:56.663 --> 01:06:59.164]  They just won't even do what he says.
[01:06:59.164 --> 01:07:03.966]  You've got other agencies just ignoring Trump completely, the White House ignoring him.
[01:07:03.966 --> 01:07:09.589]  Trump says give these ambassadors jobs, let Rex Tillerson decide, and Rens Prevost just ignores it.
[01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:14.532]  It's crazy to see how they've tried to block him in 32 days in office.
[01:07:16.049 --> 01:07:28.774]  But despite that, I've even got CNN admitting the best consumer spending in 25 years, job surging, just incredible things, hundreds of billions of jobs coming back, two plus trillion in the stock market.
[01:07:28.774 --> 01:07:31.816]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, of course, is an expert on the economy.
[01:07:31.816 --> 01:07:35.897]  He's a Harvard graduate when it gets to being involved in the economy and banking.
[01:07:35.897 --> 01:07:37.318]  Known Donald Trump for 40 plus years.
[01:07:37.318 --> 01:07:39.919]  He's a three-time number one New York Times bestseller.
[01:07:40.319 --> 01:07:46.927]  I've got to stop with this whole pedigree though, but he is the Infowars.com bureau chief building operation in D.C.
[01:07:46.927 --> 01:07:54.815]  He's got stories out, report, Muslim sympathizers at CIA behind Trump leaks, Obama loyalists still at CIA fuel radical Islam.
[01:07:55.536 --> 01:07:56.937]  And that's what this all ties into.
[01:07:56.937 --> 01:08:03.919]  And again, this is all, it's mainstream news that Brennan was a Wahhabi, a Saudi Arabian convert to Islam.
[01:08:03.919 --> 01:08:06.460]  So now, he's been in D.C.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.701]  last few weeks covering all this.
[01:08:08.701 --> 01:08:10.002]  What are we really facing?
[01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:11.242]  Where are we in this country?
[01:08:11.242 --> 01:08:12.723]  Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:08:13.703 --> 01:08:15.824]  Well, I think you've got it exactly right, Alex.
[01:08:15.824 --> 01:08:22.306]  First of all, the opposition to Donald Trump from within is really the story.
[01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:24.047]  I mean, just take the CIA.
[01:08:24.047 --> 01:08:32.751]  You've got John Brennan, and people should remember that John Brennan was his private security firm that in March 2008
[01:08:34.565 --> 01:08:40.268]  broke in to breach Obama's passport files and sanitize the files.
[01:08:40.268 --> 01:08:45.970]  John Brennan at that time was heading a intelligence firm based in Arlington, Virginia.
[01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:57.096]  Of course, then Brennan moved into the White House as a National Security Advisor, one of the top advisors to President Obama, and ends up as head of the CIA.
[01:08:58.484 --> 01:09:07.968]  Now, I've reported extensively over the years that Brennan, first of all, he speaks Saudi Arabian fluently.
[01:09:07.968 --> 01:09:12.030]  He was a station chief for the CIA in Saudi Arabia.
[01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:19.533]  He studied as an undergraduate at American University in Cairo in the 1970s where he studied Arabic.
[01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:34.906]  And I'm convinced that over time, John Brennan was a full convert to Islam, kept it secret, and in fact has been a Muslim sympathizer along the... And by the way, high-level CIA people, that's just like a known, by the way, now.
[01:09:34.906 --> 01:09:35.987]  It's like known that he did that.
[01:09:36.927 --> 01:09:46.033]  And also, it was a systematic packing of the CIA and other intelligence agencies with Muslim sympathizers.
[01:09:46.033 --> 01:09:54.558]  The whole Muslim Brotherhood infiltration of the Obama White House is one of the major scandals, I think, of the entire administration.
[01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:56.479]  And these people are still there.
[01:09:56.479 --> 01:09:58.861]  That's the problem, is that with Brennan
[01:09:59.481 --> 01:10:00.042]  Gone.
[01:10:00.042 --> 01:10:00.642]  Resigned.
[01:10:00.642 --> 01:10:02.824]  It doesn't mean that the lower levels are gone.
[01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:10.892]  I was about to say, when Trump was about to get in, within two days, on January 18, 2017, he says, watch your mouth.
[01:10:10.892 --> 01:10:15.817]  The arrogance there noted that he had some power, some stay-behind networks.
[01:10:16.567 --> 01:10:21.091]  Well, and it's packed all through the government, including in the White House.
[01:10:21.091 --> 01:10:22.832]  I mean, this is the problem.
[01:10:22.832 --> 01:10:23.552]  It's nonsense.
[01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:26.955]  We've applied for press credentials and, you know, we're in the process.
[01:10:26.955 --> 01:10:28.036]  I'm sure we're going to get them.
[01:10:28.036 --> 01:10:30.798]  I have no hesitation to doubt that at all.
[01:10:30.798 --> 01:10:39.445]  But the point is, it's the blocking from within the White House and the State Department and the CIA.
[01:10:39.445 --> 01:10:42.487]  Oh, no one's even doing anything Tillerson says.
[01:10:42.487 --> 01:10:43.568]  It's like a total rebellion.
[01:10:44.508 --> 01:10:52.537]  In fact, the whole top level of deputies resigned, and now Tillerson's gone to another level.
[01:10:52.537 --> 01:10:53.598]  It was unprecedented.
[01:10:53.598 --> 01:11:03.028]  A thousand State Department officials signed a dissent memorandum against President Obama's executive order on immigration.
[01:11:03.629 --> 01:11:13.424]  Now, you know, that's to me a thousand names right there that should be put on the chopping block right away because they're not going to agree with President Trump's policies.
[01:11:13.424 --> 01:11:17.911]  They're Obama's sympathizers and loyalists, and you're going to be fighting
[01:11:18.655 --> 01:11:22.636]  The government from the bureaucracy and the White House holdovers.
[01:11:22.636 --> 01:11:27.218]  I mean... But is it almost not a Herculean task like the Aegean Stables?
[01:11:27.218 --> 01:11:31.319]  How is Trump supposed to battle all this when it's not just what we're dealing with.
[01:11:31.319 --> 01:11:32.579]  It's on every front.
[01:11:32.579 --> 01:11:33.640]  No one does what he says.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:39.584]  Well, I think this is one of the frustrations that's going to become apparent to President Trump very quickly.
[01:11:39.584 --> 01:11:41.706]  In fact, I'm sure he's already aware of it.
[01:11:41.706 --> 01:11:47.130]  That you're going to have to clean house massively in the bureaucracy in the White House.
[01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:59.199]  It's almost, I think, if someone was in a bureaucratic position, any one of the agencies or the White House, when President Obama was in office... Shouldn't they have like a loyalty pledge to at least execute the President's will?
[01:11:59.199 --> 01:12:00.000]  That's constitutional.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.440]  They're gone.
[01:12:01.141 --> 01:12:09.965]  Well, see, the problem is they don't do what, you know, this is, the State Department is essentially a rogue organization and it has been for a long time.
[01:12:09.965 --> 01:12:12.847]  I should add, you didn't work for them, so you know.
[01:12:12.847 --> 01:12:30.696]  Well, and it is rogue because you've got holdovers from, you know, going back to probably Jimmy Carter in the State Department, who formed years of democratic policy with foreign countries and have a completely different agenda than President Trump.
[01:12:31.357 --> 01:12:33.239]  They're basically Muslim sympathizers.
[01:12:33.239 --> 01:12:35.882]  I was about to say, the arrogance is unprecedented.
[01:12:35.882 --> 01:12:49.016]  Oh, it's just, it's, and, you know, and the idea that they can sign dissent memorandums and publish that against the president when, in fact, their point of duty is to carry out the president's directives.
[01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:50.918]  Now let's explain, they're under the executive.
[01:12:50.918 --> 01:12:52.200]  It's not like they're in some other branch.
[01:12:53.058 --> 01:13:06.240]  No, and basically they're thumbing their nose at President Trump and the White House and saying, in the State Department we're going to execute, continue to execute, President Obama's foreign policy and we're not going to listen to President Trump.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.303]  They don't agree with it, so they're not going to do it.
[01:13:09.303 --> 01:13:14.548]  That's the, that's the degree of insubordination that you're getting.
[01:13:14.548 --> 01:13:16.070]  Or mutiny.
[01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:17.231]  It's like, exactly.
[01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:19.833]  It is, in a sense, it is a shadow government.
[01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:22.957]  It is a kind of a cold coup.
[01:13:22.957 --> 01:13:24.238]  I just played Seculo.
[01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:25.880]  It's even on Fox, they're saying it's a coup.
[01:13:26.661 --> 01:13:28.142]  And in fact, Sekulow is right.
[01:13:28.142 --> 01:13:29.082]  I know Jay Sekulow.
[01:13:29.082 --> 01:13:30.283]  He's very astute.
[01:13:30.283 --> 01:13:31.384]  He's exactly right.
[01:13:31.384 --> 01:13:33.024]  I've known him for years.
[01:13:33.024 --> 01:13:36.146]  And his judgment's completely correct.
[01:13:36.146 --> 01:13:44.150]  It's also not just in the NSA and the State Department and the CIA, but it's all through these agencies.
[01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:45.451]  You've got Defense Intelligence.
[01:13:45.451 --> 01:13:45.851]  So what do we do?
[01:13:45.851 --> 01:13:46.471]  What does Trump do?
[01:13:46.471 --> 01:13:50.013]  I know he listens to you and he respects you and myself and others.
[01:13:50.013 --> 01:13:51.114]  What does he do?
[01:13:51.114 --> 01:13:54.796]  Well, I'm recommending very strongly that anyone who was in
[01:13:55.656 --> 01:14:02.838]  Any of these bureaucracies, or the White House, prior to Donald Trump coming in, needs to systematically be fired.
[01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:06.238]  No, I agree, but it's like almost all of them, so what does he, that's his problem.
[01:14:06.238 --> 01:14:08.319]  I mean, where does he get new people?
[01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:11.879]  Well, first of all, I don't think I'd worry about it.
[01:14:11.879 --> 01:14:14.600]  You know, my solution to... No, I agree, that's what Trump was saying.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.260]  They're not doing, that's what Tillerson said.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.721]  He said, don't worry, none of them are doing any work anyways.
[01:14:19.324 --> 01:14:22.929]  Right, and if they are doing work, they're doing work counter to what you want them to do.
[01:14:22.929 --> 01:14:27.155]  I mean, the State Department, you reduce the State Department by two-thirds.
[01:14:27.155 --> 01:14:29.979]  That's key, it'd just be better to have them do nothing because they're working against us already.
[01:14:30.731 --> 01:14:31.231]  Precisely.
[01:14:49.346 --> 01:14:51.089]  Yeah, Obama went crazy the last month alone.
[01:15:01.986 --> 01:15:06.127]  And, you know, again, these departments need to be systematically looked at.
[01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:09.768]  The Department of Education, you know, the fundamental question is, why do we need it?
[01:15:09.768 --> 01:15:10.668]  Yeah, who do we need them?
[01:15:10.668 --> 01:15:13.329]  I mean, one thing, they were teaching Second Amendment and all this.
[01:15:13.329 --> 01:15:14.609]  That still wouldn't be constitutional.
[01:15:14.609 --> 01:15:16.150]  Instead, they're teaching total sedition.
[01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:17.870]  When you come back, though, because you've done deep research.
[01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:23.871]  You were the first person, other than like David Horowitz, I heard like 15 years ago say there's an Islamic merger with the liberals.
[01:15:23.871 --> 01:15:25.132]  And I said I was wrong.
[01:15:25.132 --> 01:15:26.112]  I didn't believe you.
[01:15:26.112 --> 01:15:27.152]  I had you on and debated you.
[01:15:27.152 --> 01:15:28.172]  You've been proven right.
[01:15:28.172 --> 01:15:29.133]  So tell us next.
[01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:29.933]  What comes next?
[01:15:31.058 --> 01:15:40.386]  In this whole alliance and burning Paris and like all this stuff happening with Dr. Jerome Corsi straight ahead.
[01:15:40.386 --> 01:15:43.268]  He writes for InfoWars.com.
[01:15:43.268 --> 01:15:49.293]  And then our reporter just back from the big Trump rally yesterday in Melbourne, Florida, Owen Schroer is here.
[01:15:49.293 --> 01:15:49.953]  So stay with us.
[01:15:49.953 --> 01:15:50.574]  It's Sunday night.
[01:15:58.513 --> 01:16:00.354]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:16:00.354 --> 01:16:06.958]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:10.099]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:19.885]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[01:16:19.885 --> 01:16:20.745]  Caveman.
[01:16:20.745 --> 01:16:25.808]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:16:25.808 --> 01:16:27.909]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:31.351]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:16:31.351 --> 01:16:36.514]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:16:36.514 --> 01:16:44.540]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:52.505]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:16:52.505 --> 01:16:57.248]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forestlife.com today.
[01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:06.481]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:17:06.481 --> 01:17:07.702]  A 360 win.

[01:17:22.173 --> 01:17:27.256]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:17:27.256 --> 01:17:33.360]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:41.164]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:17:41.164 --> 01:17:48.368]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:17:48.368 --> 01:17:49.169]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:17:49.329 --> 01:17:51.755]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:51.755 --> 01:17:53.760]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:57.609]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:17:59.079 --> 01:18:00.681]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:18:00.681 --> 01:18:03.264]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.
[01:18:03.264 --> 01:18:10.772]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:18:10.772 --> 01:18:21.083]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:18:21.403 --> 01:18:29.246]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:39.449]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:18:39.449 --> 01:18:41.510]  And this part is most important.
[01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:48.012]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standards.
[01:18:48.332 --> 01:18:52.634]  Hey everyone!
[01:18:52.634 --> 01:19:05.721]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:19:05.721 --> 01:19:07.802]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:19:07.802 --> 01:19:17.687]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:19:17.827 --> 01:19:18.267]  I think so.
[01:19:39.147 --> 01:19:39.968]  We're good to go.
[01:20:19.053 --> 01:20:37.778]  You know, I knew that a lot of elements of our government were funding radical Islam 20 years ago, but I couldn't believe they would actually turn the West over to it.
[01:20:37.778 --> 01:20:43.039]  And then I realized it's just a bunch of elites that want control over society.
[01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:48.000]  So if a system is authoritarian and oppressive, they're going to support it.
[01:20:50.996 --> 01:20:52.197]  I don't know all the answers.
[01:20:52.197 --> 01:20:54.739]  I just know that Trump is turning the economy back on.
[01:20:54.739 --> 01:20:59.523]  The numbers are exploding for small businesses and independent groups and poor people.
[01:20:59.523 --> 01:21:01.025]  That's in CNN today.
[01:21:01.025 --> 01:21:02.125]  So what are they going to do?
[01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:08.130]  I want to ask Dr. Jerome Corsi because, again, the average person doesn't think evil like this.
[01:21:09.136 --> 01:21:10.797]  And I have like a blind spot.
[01:21:10.797 --> 01:21:12.799]  I can't think like this.
[01:21:12.799 --> 01:21:14.160]  And then we see it happening.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.281]  How is it going for the globalists?
[01:21:16.281 --> 01:21:21.045]  Seems like they're in trouble everywhere from the Netherlands to Spain to France to Brazil.
[01:21:21.045 --> 01:21:30.132]  I mean, of course, you've got all this news about this weird Wahhabist alliance with the former head of the CIA, who admittedly converted to Islam.
[01:21:30.132 --> 01:21:31.313]  What were they thinking?
[01:21:31.313 --> 01:21:32.674]  What was the plan?
[01:21:32.674 --> 01:21:33.975]  And then how were they doing?
[01:21:33.975 --> 01:21:35.636]  Are we starting to beat them or what's going on?
[01:21:36.414 --> 01:21:43.319]  Well, first of all, it's an alliance to bring down America and to bring, you know, a global government.
[01:21:43.319 --> 01:21:45.981]  It's a revolutionary alliance.
[01:21:45.981 --> 01:21:55.068]  The far left, which comes out of, you know, communism, socialism, Saul Alinsky, wants revolution.
[01:21:55.068 --> 01:21:56.770]  They want to see fundamental
[01:21:57.665 --> 01:22:11.165]  Government falling down change so any group like Islam that is opposed to the West as opposed to the United States opposed to democratic systems is going to be a friend of the far left.
[01:22:11.818 --> 01:22:20.328]  And the far left plays demographic games by infiltrating the country with Muslims, infiltrating the country with illegal immigrants.
[01:22:20.328 --> 01:22:26.855]  The demographics are changed, so the control is lost and the social tensions rise.
[01:22:26.855 --> 01:22:30.759]  That's social, you know, communism... And they play off that tension.
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.761]  They play that tension to create it.
[01:22:33.761 --> 01:22:35.682]  Now, the left is losing.
[01:22:35.682 --> 01:22:40.764]  You can see in the United States Donald Trump's win, the win of Brexit.
[01:22:40.764 --> 01:22:44.366]  I think what's going to be a win for Le Pen, certainly in the first round.
[01:22:44.366 --> 01:22:47.047]  We're going to see all across the EU.
[01:22:47.047 --> 01:22:49.048]  Wilders of the Netherlands?
[01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:50.889]  How are they going to respond to this?
[01:22:50.889 --> 01:22:53.690]  Well, the left is going to go increasingly violent.
[01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:56.473]  They were beating women up and they were attacking me!
[01:23:09.147 --> 01:23:12.688]  We just had released this weekend a whole organizing manual.
[01:23:12.688 --> 01:23:14.848]  These protesters are being trained.
[01:23:14.848 --> 01:23:18.449]  They're being... Oh yeah, I've got... That's what Sekulow talked about.
[01:23:18.449 --> 01:23:20.790]  A 30,000 person deal with Obama saying overthrow it.
[01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:23.150]  I've got it right here, like you just mentioned.
[01:23:23.150 --> 01:23:25.931]  A manual on how to overthrow a training manual.
[01:23:25.931 --> 01:23:27.031]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:23:27.031 --> 01:23:28.671]  Out of the New York Post.
[01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:32.072]  Linked activists have a training manual for protesting and overthrowing Trump.
[01:23:32.965 --> 01:23:43.353]  And even how to infiltrate these town hall meetings, where to sit, how to sit in groups, what signs to bring, how to disrupt the meetings.
[01:23:43.353 --> 01:23:51.279]  You're going to see, like you saw in Washington during the inauguration, violent protests, breaking windows, throwing rocks, people dressed in black.
[01:23:51.599 --> 01:23:57.661]  And Trump knows that, so he's mobilizing the people to say mainstream media is your enemy.
[01:23:57.661 --> 01:24:00.841]  Well, they're sided with Soros and globalists all over the country.
[01:24:00.841 --> 01:24:01.842]  That's just true.
[01:24:01.842 --> 01:24:06.063]  He's only saying what's true, which is so weird to see a president.
[01:24:06.063 --> 01:24:10.464]  Reagan was great, but I got to be honest, if Trump can keep in, I think he's going to be like...
[01:24:11.244 --> 01:24:12.206]  Way beyond Reagan.
[01:24:12.206 --> 01:24:14.689]  I mean, by himself, he's totally opposed.
[01:24:14.689 --> 01:24:16.552]  No one under him will do his agenda.
[01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:19.896]  But just by sheer force of will, he's dominating.
[01:24:19.896 --> 01:24:23.782]  I mean, I'm not in some cult of worshipping Trump, but of course, you've known him 40 years.
[01:24:23.782 --> 01:24:24.843]  You met with him last year.
[01:24:24.843 --> 01:24:26.646]  I mean, Trump is amazing.
[01:24:27.281 --> 01:24:28.222]  He's the real deal.
[01:24:28.222 --> 01:24:29.844]  I'm betting on Donald Trump.
[01:24:29.844 --> 01:24:31.987]  I've seen him do it over and over again.
[01:24:31.987 --> 01:24:35.291]  He'll change his whole organization if he needs to.
[01:24:35.291 --> 01:24:37.794]  He fired Lewandowski.
[01:24:37.794 --> 01:24:40.217]  Oh yeah, they're calling it loser that he'll fire a few people.
[01:24:40.217 --> 01:24:41.079]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[01:24:42.072 --> 01:24:43.814]  That's what a CEO does.
[01:24:43.814 --> 01:24:46.236]  If you have to get rid of the whole organization, start over again.
[01:24:46.236 --> 01:24:50.920]  If they're not working for you, they want to work for themselves, they can go create their own company.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.801]  And it's going to be the same in the federal government.
[01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:54.022]  Donald Trump will persist.
[01:24:54.022 --> 01:25:05.292]  If he has to shut down half of the bureaucracy, or three-quarters of the bureaucracy, if he has to start in some of these agencies and fire by- No, I agree, because why get them to do the right thing?
[01:25:05.292 --> 01:25:07.193]  We should just replace it all, that's how we win.
[01:25:07.193 --> 01:25:07.794]  That's what they did.
[01:25:09.019 --> 01:25:12.342]  Civil Service, reassign them to Nome, Alaska.
[01:25:12.342 --> 01:25:16.365]  You know, say, good, we can't fire you, so you report tomorrow to Nome, Alaska.
[01:25:16.365 --> 01:25:18.267]  That's where your new office is.
[01:25:18.267 --> 01:25:19.408]  Good luck.
[01:25:19.408 --> 01:25:21.990]  You know, because you can reassign them, you can make them quit.
[01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:23.652]  Well, Doc, come back on tomorrow.
[01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:25.553]  I assume we're going to watch more shows.
[01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:28.136]  It'll be on more than just four hours a day, because people want the demand.
[01:25:28.136 --> 01:25:29.357]  They need to hear it.
[01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:31.819]  But just what else is on your radar screen with your great work you're doing?
[01:25:32.438 --> 01:25:40.445]  Well, I'm going to release a whole series of articles this week and show that it really was the Democrats who were being paid by Russia.
[01:25:40.445 --> 01:25:45.629]  By the way, two months ago when I was first hiring you, you told me all this and I said, are you kidding?
[01:25:45.629 --> 01:25:48.611]  It's in the Washington Post.
[01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:54.396]  It's all over admitting that the Russians were funding the Washington Post and everything like you said.
[01:25:55.579 --> 01:26:01.681]  Yeah, and Podesta, you know, we've got the... He was getting stock from this company, Jolie.
[01:26:01.681 --> 01:26:03.041]  Well, how did you know that, though?
[01:26:03.041 --> 01:26:04.242]  Because nobody else was saying that.
[01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:05.462]  That's in the news now.
[01:26:05.462 --> 01:26:09.163]  It was in WikiLeaks, and I've also spent a career in international finance.
[01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:11.584]  I mean, I know how money laundering works.
[01:26:11.584 --> 01:26:15.145]  Remember, I caught HSBC money laundering.
[01:26:15.145 --> 01:26:16.365]  I was the one who blew the whistle.
[01:26:16.365 --> 01:26:19.206]  It cost them $1.9 billion.
[01:26:19.206 --> 01:26:21.867]  I had a thousand pages of records from John Cruz.
[01:26:21.867 --> 01:26:23.127]  I knew how they were laundering money.
[01:26:23.767 --> 01:26:25.068]  I brought down HSBC.
[01:26:25.068 --> 01:26:26.428]  So explain me the double game.
[01:26:26.428 --> 01:26:30.750]  Russia claims it's on the side of Trump, but meanwhile they're funding the Liberals.
[01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:33.511]  It was all, and also Hillary Clinton.
[01:26:33.511 --> 01:26:36.753]  Hillary Clinton had passed through accounts.
[01:26:36.753 --> 01:26:39.414]  She was getting money off the books from Russia.
[01:26:39.414 --> 01:26:41.695]  She was being paid for the uranium.
[01:26:41.695 --> 01:26:49.058]  Both Podesta and Hillary and the Democrats were transferring technology to Russia, and Russia was paying him handsomely.
[01:26:49.318 --> 01:26:54.300]  And she knew that was her weak point, so she made it all about Trump.
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:58.021]  Don't you agree that she and her deep state of mind with Trump, it's not vindictive, it's justice.
[01:26:58.021 --> 01:26:59.641]  Shouldn't he go after them now?
[01:27:18.325 --> 01:27:20.026]  Well, he's got to go after them.
[01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.067]  Trump has no choice.
[01:27:21.067 --> 01:27:23.188]  I mean, Hillary Clinton's not going to go away.
[01:27:23.188 --> 01:27:25.430]  Barack Obama's going to sit in D.C.
[01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:26.070]  and cause trouble.
[01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.951]  In his bunker!
[01:27:26.951 --> 01:27:28.912]  I say he wants a fight, give him one!
[01:27:28.912 --> 01:27:40.060]  Well, let's go through a chapter and verse of how the Clinton Foundation was a money laundering scheme, how the Russians were using it as a money laundering scheme, and how Barack Obama knew it.
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:44.623]  Because it has to be known by the, yes, certainly by the NSA was knowing it, it was monitored.
[01:27:44.623 --> 01:27:48.005]  So the Russians knew Trump would find out, so they hedged their bets being nice to him?
[01:27:48.652 --> 01:27:51.893]  Well, the Russians basically wanted Hillary to win.
[01:27:51.893 --> 01:27:53.674]  I've said that from the very beginning.
[01:27:53.674 --> 01:27:56.575]  The Russians didn't intervene in this election.
[01:27:56.575 --> 01:27:57.775]  They weren't hacking the data.
[01:27:57.775 --> 01:28:01.076]  Well, no, the Pope did, the Communist Chinese, the EU did.
[01:28:01.076 --> 01:28:02.857]  Assange said that he got the data.
[01:28:02.857 --> 01:28:07.278]  I'm convinced Assange got the Podesta emails from within Podesta.
[01:28:08.849 --> 01:28:10.871]  It was a Democrat that turned them all over.
[01:28:10.871 --> 01:28:11.771]  Well, they shot him in the back.
[01:28:11.771 --> 01:28:12.452]  We know that.
[01:28:12.452 --> 01:28:12.972]  We'll do this.
[01:28:12.972 --> 01:28:15.034]  Come back on tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:28:15.034 --> 01:28:15.555]  to 3 p.m.
[01:28:15.555 --> 01:28:15.935]  Central.
[01:28:15.935 --> 01:28:17.096]  Let's talk about it.
[01:28:17.096 --> 01:28:19.678]  Let's flesh out where you think things are going.
[01:28:19.678 --> 01:28:21.579]  Dr. Jeremy Corsi, Infowars.com.
[01:28:21.579 --> 01:28:24.302]  We should set up a Twitter account with Infowars as well.
[01:28:24.302 --> 01:28:27.044]  What's the email with Infowars if folks want to send you a tweet?
[01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:28.585]  Or send you a tip?
[01:28:28.585 --> 01:28:29.445]  We're setting that up.
[01:28:29.445 --> 01:28:31.207]  I mean, I'm still in the process.
[01:28:31.207 --> 01:28:33.628]  We'll get that set up this next week.
[01:28:33.628 --> 01:28:36.290]  But they can still email me at always by... That's right.
[01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:40.973]  It's drc, d-r-c, at Infowars.com.
[01:28:40.973 --> 01:28:41.993]  We just got that set up.
[01:28:41.993 --> 01:28:43.454]  I haven't even used it or checked it out.
[01:28:43.454 --> 01:28:44.335]  We're going to get you set up.
[01:28:44.335 --> 01:28:45.436]  You're doing a great job.
[01:28:45.436 --> 01:28:46.977]  Dr. Corsi, thank you so much.
[01:28:46.977 --> 01:28:48.217]  Boy, you've been proven right.
[01:28:48.217 --> 01:28:50.239]  We're going to come back with Owen Schroer in the studio.
[01:28:50.239 --> 01:28:55.002]  He was there at the epic, it just gets better and better, Trump rally yesterday in Melbourne, Florida.
[01:28:58.337 --> 01:29:04.963]  An African American Trump supporter passionately slammed a town hall meeting regarding sanctuary cities.
[01:29:04.963 --> 01:29:07.365]  She preached, I'm not going anywhere.
[01:29:07.365 --> 01:29:09.786]  Sanctuary cities are racist.
[01:29:09.786 --> 01:29:12.609]  All the jobs are going to illegals.
[01:29:12.609 --> 01:29:13.810]  That is wrong.
[01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:16.893]  You're not going to be allowed to get away with it.
[01:29:16.893 --> 01:29:22.818]  The black community has been destroyed by racist, illegal immigration.
[01:29:22.818 --> 01:29:25.721]  And we're not gonna have it, she roared.
[01:29:25.721 --> 01:29:27.182]  Thank God for Trump.
[01:29:27.182 --> 01:29:29.064]  Thank God for Sessions.
[01:29:29.064 --> 01:29:31.386]  And you should be ashamed of yourselves.
[01:29:31.806 --> 01:29:33.327]  How dare you!
[01:29:33.327 --> 01:29:41.856]  This just goes to show that the African Americans know that Trump's immigration policies are going to benefit the inner cities.
[01:29:41.856 --> 01:29:52.405]  Maybe if the left would stop virtue signaling for a moment, they'd realize that their misguided efforts to interfere with Trump's policies are counterproductive.
[01:29:52.405 --> 01:29:55.348]  This is Millie Weaver, signing off for InfoWars.com.
[01:29:58.835 --> 01:30:00.697]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:30:00.697 --> 01:30:02.038]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:30:02.038 --> 01:30:03.259]  Why is this so good?
[01:30:03.259 --> 01:30:08.543]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:30:08.543 --> 01:30:22.094]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:30:22.094 --> 01:30:23.456]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:30:24.236 --> 01:30:25.857]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:30:25.857 --> 01:30:28.440]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.741]  These are all parasites.
[01:30:29.741 --> 01:30:30.842]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:32.183]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:30:32.183 --> 01:30:36.686]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:30:36.686 --> 01:30:39.869]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:30:39.909 --> 01:30:43.011]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:30:43.011 --> 01:30:44.072]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:30:44.072 --> 01:30:46.014]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:46.014 --> 01:30:47.035]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:30:47.035 --> 01:30:49.717]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:30:49.717 --> 01:30:52.999]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:52.999 --> 01:30:55.241]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:30:55.241 --> 01:30:57.203]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:30:58.516 --> 01:31:00.317]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:31:00.317 --> 01:31:02.437]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:31:02.437 --> 01:31:05.339]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:31:05.339 --> 01:31:11.401]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:31:11.401 --> 01:31:20.604]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:31:20.604 --> 01:31:25.446]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:31:25.686 --> 01:31:28.128]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:28.128 --> 01:31:36.156]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:36.156 --> 01:31:37.117]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:42.264]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:42.264 --> 01:31:45.847]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:45.847 --> 01:31:52.553]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:31:52.553 --> 01:31:56.677]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:00.069 --> 01:32:04.616]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:32:14.548 --> 01:32:20.391]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:32:20.391 --> 01:32:26.514]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:32:26.514 --> 01:32:32.817]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:32:32.817 --> 01:32:35.258]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:32:35.518 --> 01:32:36.699]  We're the solution!
[01:32:36.699 --> 01:32:37.680]  Americans!
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.241]  Ain't nothing more to it than that!
[01:32:39.241 --> 01:32:44.604]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:32:44.604 --> 01:32:46.285]  Theatrical screening's on demand.
[01:32:46.285 --> 01:32:48.187]  DVD's now available.
[01:32:48.187 --> 01:32:51.629]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:53.790]  Americans need to see this film.
[01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:12.999]  We are on the march.
[01:33:12.999 --> 01:33:16.161]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:16.161 --> 01:33:20.824]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:20.824 --> 01:33:36.315]  I'm waiting in my cold cell as the bell... I'm reflecting on my past life.
[01:33:36.315 --> 01:33:39.397]  Yes, it doesn't have much time.
[01:33:41.564 --> 01:33:45.107]  Now, the Republic was hanging by a thread, wasn't it?
[01:33:45.107 --> 01:33:55.517]  Because at five o'clock, they'd take me to the gallows pole.
[01:33:55.517 --> 01:34:05.165]  The sands of time, for me, are running low.
[01:34:05.165 --> 01:34:07.788]  Not giving a damn is the most important part of a radio broadcast.
[01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:15.326]  Owen just got back, being besieged by families, getting their hot daughters to try to go out with him.
[01:34:15.326 --> 01:34:19.208]  He was just telling me during the break, I know that's our problem, believe me, I know.
[01:34:19.208 --> 01:34:21.949]  Everybody wants to be like a little trendy dumbass, everybody wants that.
[01:34:21.949 --> 01:34:26.052]  But seriously, let's talk, there's like, what did you do, 15, 20 videos?
[01:34:26.052 --> 01:34:27.292]  How many are on F4?
[01:34:27.292 --> 01:34:29.613]  We did some good work, I think about, yeah, 15.
[01:34:29.613 --> 01:34:32.215]  Wilson's first trip out with us, one of our new cameramen, so.
[01:34:32.215 --> 01:34:32.975]  Did he have fun?
[01:34:32.975 --> 01:34:34.496]  So he did have fun, he did have fun.
[01:34:34.496 --> 01:34:35.577]  I think he had a little too much fun.
[01:34:36.502 --> 01:34:38.643]  I think I had a little too much fun too.
[01:34:38.643 --> 01:34:42.084]  You were describing it like, just like, here's my daughter.
[01:34:42.084 --> 01:34:44.385]  Do you want to talk about that?
[01:34:44.385 --> 01:34:45.545]  Let's do it, let's talk about it.
[01:34:45.545 --> 01:34:48.126]  Well no, it's the curse of being a patriot.
[01:34:48.126 --> 01:34:50.767]  It's just women being thrown at you constantly.
[01:34:50.767 --> 01:34:55.769]  So basically we've reached a point in time now where parents are so desperate, I guess, that have these daughters.
[01:34:55.769 --> 01:34:57.430]  Can we turn that camera up?
[01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:58.870]  I don't think it's an expensive camera.
[01:34:58.870 --> 01:35:00.691]  You look like a gamelon, like blue skin.
[01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:02.351]  Yeah.
[01:35:02.351 --> 01:35:03.672]  Anyways, go back to the women.
[01:35:03.672 --> 01:35:10.778]  So, no, so I guess we're living in a point in time now where parents who have daughters who are in their 20s and are still single and not getting married.
[01:35:10.778 --> 01:35:11.558]  They come to Trump rallies.
[01:35:11.558 --> 01:35:12.199]  They're worried.
[01:35:12.199 --> 01:35:12.800]  They're worried.
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:15.262]  They come to Trump rallies looking for somebody that's not a cuck.
[01:35:15.888 --> 01:35:17.549]  Yeah, so you know... That makes sense.
[01:35:17.549 --> 01:35:22.353]  Basically, I have parents kind of, you know, I don't know if you want to say proposing for their daughters.
[01:35:22.353 --> 01:35:24.135]  Let's just say there's like... It's nice.
[01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:27.558]  There's like tennis machines that shoot tennis balls, so it's like women being fired.
[01:35:27.558 --> 01:35:29.139]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:35:29.139 --> 01:35:31.881]  You're like, oh my god, stop!
[01:35:31.881 --> 01:35:32.962]  It's not quite like that.
[01:35:32.962 --> 01:35:34.163]  It's not quite like that.
[01:35:34.163 --> 01:35:35.944]  Because they come over like every 30 seconds.
[01:35:35.944 --> 01:35:37.366]  Is that what it's like for you?
[01:35:37.366 --> 01:35:38.947]  Is that why you had to quit going out?
[01:35:38.947 --> 01:35:39.988]  Because everyone asks about you.
[01:35:39.988 --> 01:35:41.269]  They always ask, where's Alex?
[01:35:41.269 --> 01:35:41.809]  We want to see Alex.
[01:35:41.809 --> 01:35:42.410]  We want to see Alex.
[01:35:43.186 --> 01:35:45.847]  I guess that's why you had to stop going out.
[01:35:45.847 --> 01:35:49.568]  No, no, let's be serious.
[01:35:49.568 --> 01:35:51.429]  The point is we don't want to be celebrities.
[01:35:51.429 --> 01:35:52.469]  We want freedom.
[01:35:52.469 --> 01:35:54.150]  But the party is what we're doing.
[01:35:54.150 --> 01:35:55.791]  Well, let's tie it into this.
[01:35:55.791 --> 01:35:57.931]  You said something earlier on the show that really resonated with me.
[01:35:57.931 --> 01:35:58.912]  I told you this in the break.
[01:35:58.912 --> 01:35:59.892]  The Trump test.
[01:35:59.892 --> 01:36:03.373]  You talked about how there's like a test right now with Trump.
[01:36:03.373 --> 01:36:05.094]  It was so simple, but it was so perfect.
[01:36:05.834 --> 01:36:10.677]  All of these people that we're seeing protesting, these are the literal brainwashed masses.
[01:36:10.677 --> 01:36:20.123]  We've been telling you about them, you've been talking about it, we know what's causing it, the fluoride, the mainstream news, we know how it all works, and now we have the byproduct.
[01:36:20.123 --> 01:36:25.266]  We can label the byproduct, we can point it out, and we can show you exactly what it is.
[01:36:25.266 --> 01:36:27.027]  And that's the Trump test.
[01:36:27.027 --> 01:36:31.470]  And who knows if this is God's will or some sort of natural providence,
[01:36:32.210 --> 01:36:34.111]  But, I mean, it's really that simple.
[01:36:34.111 --> 01:36:36.472]  I mean, think about it, Alex.
[01:36:36.472 --> 01:36:48.237]  How can you tell the difference between a human who wants to see humanity go to the stars, and he wants to work for it, between a human who wants to sit around all day and accept a welfare check?
[01:36:48.757 --> 01:36:51.419]  No, that's dehumanization.
[01:36:51.419 --> 01:36:52.560]  Talk about your observance.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.842]  I don't know if you were inside.
[01:36:53.842 --> 01:36:55.243]  I saw the videos outside.
[01:36:55.243 --> 01:36:55.563]  You didn't.
[01:36:55.563 --> 01:36:56.584]  We didn't go inside, no.
[01:36:56.584 --> 01:36:58.105]  The speech was so powerful.
[01:36:58.105 --> 01:37:02.590]  This destiny, this will, all the job numbers coming in, everything exploding.
[01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:03.951]  And then, like, I saw the people bitching.
[01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:07.674]  You interviewed, like, Trump's rich and wants to make me poor when it's the opposite.
[01:37:08.935 --> 01:37:12.596]  They literally are parroting fake news, or just making things up.
[01:37:12.596 --> 01:37:15.697]  They keep saying he's anti-immigrant, he's anti-immigrant, he's anti-immigrant.
[01:37:15.697 --> 01:37:17.457]  I ask, what is he anti-immigrant?
[01:37:17.457 --> 01:37:18.677]  What has he done that's anti-immigrant?
[01:37:18.677 --> 01:37:20.698]  They say the travel ban.
[01:37:20.698 --> 01:37:22.898]  That has nothing to do with immigration.
[01:37:22.898 --> 01:37:24.939]  They say he wants to build a wall.
[01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:31.600]  Okay, that's because... Exactly, because actual deportations are down, because they're not just deporting regular people, they're deporting criminals.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.820]  But none of that matters.
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.561]  It's just like, oh my god, it's just hell on earth.
[01:37:36.261 --> 01:37:39.304]  Talking to these people, again, I mean, we've proven it ad nauseum.
[01:37:39.304 --> 01:37:40.125]  They have nothing to say.
[01:37:40.125 --> 01:37:41.286]  They're fake protesters.
[01:37:41.286 --> 01:37:42.867]  They have a fake reality.
[01:37:42.867 --> 01:37:43.768]  And that's another thing, too.
[01:37:43.768 --> 01:37:45.489]  That's the other part of this test.
[01:37:45.489 --> 01:37:48.732]  Who lives in reality, and who doesn't?
[01:37:48.732 --> 01:37:54.858]  I'm not saying that everybody who doesn't like Trump doesn't live in reality, but these protesters that we're talking to, that we go out,
[01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:58.259]  99% of them don't live in reality.
[01:37:58.259 --> 01:37:59.660]  I mean, I don't know what their problem is.
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:00.200]  I really don't know.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.262]  Maybe they just have been drinking fluoride their whole life.
[01:38:02.262 --> 01:38:04.544]  Maybe they weren't breastfed as a child.
[01:38:04.544 --> 01:38:07.526]  Maybe they're just drugged out of their minds with pills.
[01:38:07.526 --> 01:38:09.527]  But that's what's going on.
[01:38:09.527 --> 01:38:11.769]  And the Trump test... I think they believe corporate media.
[01:38:11.769 --> 01:38:14.211]  They just go with corporate media must be the answer.
[01:38:14.211 --> 01:38:15.532]  I'm a loser.
[01:38:15.532 --> 01:38:18.934]  So if I join corporate media, I should be a winner.
[01:38:18.934 --> 01:38:21.676]  I asked them if they like CNN and MSNBC.
[01:38:21.676 --> 01:38:22.137]  They say no.
[01:38:24.636 --> 01:38:26.477]  What the hell is that?
[01:38:26.477 --> 01:38:30.639]  Well, all I know is... Here's the Pope.
[01:38:30.639 --> 01:38:31.460]  Pope Francis.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:32.560]  Look at this article.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.481]  This is out of Breitbart.
[01:38:34.481 --> 01:38:36.642]  Muslim terrorism does not exist.
[01:38:36.642 --> 01:38:37.843]  That's a quote.
[01:38:37.843 --> 01:38:39.143]  That's what they say out there.
[01:38:39.143 --> 01:38:39.764]  Here's another one.
[01:38:39.764 --> 01:38:43.946]  Angela Merkel says Europe must take more refugees and Islam is a source of terror.
[01:38:43.946 --> 01:38:46.047]  That's a close quote.
[01:38:46.047 --> 01:38:46.847]  That's unbelievable.
[01:38:46.847 --> 01:38:48.408]  It's like saying Santa Claus is real.
[01:38:48.408 --> 01:38:49.369]  This is such BS.
[01:38:50.329 --> 01:38:52.812]  This guy has 200 foot walls around his house.
[01:38:52.812 --> 01:38:53.953]  What is he saying?
[01:38:53.953 --> 01:38:54.833]  So there you go.
[01:38:54.833 --> 01:38:58.937]  So the Trump test reaches the highest levels of our society.
[01:38:58.937 --> 01:39:03.041]  So it's not just the average folk that are going to Trump rallies, okay?
[01:39:03.041 --> 01:39:06.804]  It's also the people in government, the people in religious institutions.
[01:39:06.804 --> 01:39:07.625]  What are they saying?
[01:39:07.625 --> 01:39:08.626]  What are they saying about Trump?
[01:39:08.626 --> 01:39:10.167]  What are they saying about radical Islamic terror?
[01:39:10.167 --> 01:39:12.889]  What are they saying about the real news that we know is going on?
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.421]  So we, okay, the Pope, fake news.
[01:39:16.421 --> 01:39:18.082]  Trump test, he failed.
[01:39:18.082 --> 01:39:19.322]  Angela Merkel, fake news.
[01:39:19.322 --> 01:39:20.862]  Trump test, she failed.
[01:39:20.862 --> 01:39:22.343]  And you just go down and down.
[01:39:22.343 --> 01:39:24.444]  And everybody knows the corporate media lies.
[01:39:24.444 --> 01:39:31.206]  I had like Der Spiegel here and they go, everyone knows there's extreme vetting and no one who's a terrorist is allowed in.
[01:39:31.206 --> 01:39:35.328]  Then they admit the UN does it with fake passports and lets them all in.
[01:39:35.328 --> 01:39:37.808]  But Der Spiegel looked at me and said, no, you're wrong.
[01:39:37.808 --> 01:39:38.689]  It's like a cult.
[01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:42.091]  So why should we roll over to radical Islam?
[01:39:42.091 --> 01:39:43.811]  I don't get it.
[01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:52.915]  And someone made the point, too, where it's like most these liberals and these protesters are either they're not religious, they're not very spiritual, or they even hate religion.
[01:39:52.915 --> 01:39:54.535]  Some of them just straight up hate religion.
[01:39:54.535 --> 01:39:58.597]  For some reason, they have this affatuation with radical Islam.
[01:39:58.597 --> 01:40:00.177]  I saw the footage in New York.
[01:40:00.177 --> 01:40:02.398]  I was there, D.C., everywhere.
[01:40:02.398 --> 01:40:05.519]  But putting hijabs on, like getting off on it, it's like
[01:40:06.786 --> 01:40:16.824]  I mean, I see on Twitter now everyone's posting videos of women from Muslim countries with their faces burned off from acid and stuff like that when they go out without their husbands.
[01:40:16.824 --> 01:40:17.486]  Why are you against it?
[01:40:17.486 --> 01:40:18.387]  That's our performance.
[01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:24.423]  Well, honestly, if it's... We shouldn't take it like a meat cleaver to a woman's face.
[01:40:24.423 --> 01:40:25.123]  It's liberal.
[01:40:25.123 --> 01:40:26.544]  You know what, though?
[01:40:26.544 --> 01:40:29.645]  Even though that's kind of sarcastic, there's actually some truth to that.
[01:40:29.645 --> 01:40:31.646]  The Satanists view it that way.
[01:40:31.646 --> 01:40:33.746]  This is art to these people.
[01:40:33.746 --> 01:40:35.647]  This is art to Satanists, Alex.
[01:40:35.647 --> 01:40:37.228]  They probably look at that and they enjoy it.
[01:40:37.228 --> 01:40:39.088]  I want to know why you're anti-female.
[01:40:39.088 --> 01:40:40.569]  Why shouldn't a woman have a right to have
[01:40:41.269 --> 01:40:48.673]  Phosphoric acid poured on her face and her nose melted off and have her genitals cut off if it's part of her loving religion at age two.
[01:40:48.673 --> 01:40:49.013]  See?
[01:40:49.013 --> 01:40:49.593]  No, I'm serious.
[01:40:49.593 --> 01:40:59.318]  Why are you, like, trying to suppress them when they could be in a slave pit in Somalia, sold on a slave block to a slave ship and raped by hundreds of men a week and then thrown in the ocean, eaten by sharks?
[01:40:59.938 --> 01:41:02.820]  Isn't that kind of like a liberal cultural experience?
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:06.882]  No, like, I actually, I love women and I don't want to see that happen to any woman.
[01:41:06.882 --> 01:41:07.623]  They don't deserve that.
[01:41:07.623 --> 01:41:14.987]  So throwing a 10 year old girl who's been raped by 500 men off the back of a boat to be eaten by sharks is not liberal?
[01:41:14.987 --> 01:41:16.048]  Well look at this, Alex.
[01:41:16.048 --> 01:41:16.809]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:41:16.809 --> 01:41:19.530]  See, that's your cultural racism.
[01:41:19.530 --> 01:41:20.511]  Oh.
[01:41:20.511 --> 01:41:21.051]  Mmm.
[01:41:21.051 --> 01:41:22.072]  Let me tell you something.
[01:41:22.072 --> 01:41:23.753]  Hanging a young girl over for sharks to eat her?
[01:41:25.287 --> 01:41:28.192]  Women deserve to be eaten by sharks under Islam.
[01:41:28.192 --> 01:41:29.374]  That's liberal.
[01:41:29.374 --> 01:41:30.516]  Why don't you just support it?
[01:41:30.516 --> 01:41:32.780]  That would be the trendy thing to do.
[01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:34.102]  The Pope told me to do it.
[01:41:34.102 --> 01:41:34.683]  The Pope!
[01:41:34.683 --> 01:41:35.084]  Ooh!
[01:41:35.084 --> 01:41:35.524]  The Pope!
[01:41:35.524 --> 01:41:36.366]  Woo!
[01:41:36.366 --> 01:41:37.448]  I love the Pope!
[01:41:37.448 --> 01:41:39.070]  The Pope that looks like a pervert.
[01:41:40.046 --> 01:41:41.307]  Probably is.
[01:41:41.307 --> 01:41:48.653]  He's the guy that blackmailed the last pope to stand down for stuff in the church, who now openly says it's disgusting that Europe says it's Christian.
[01:41:48.653 --> 01:41:49.935]  But so look at this, Alex.
[01:41:49.935 --> 01:41:52.797]  So you're talking about why won't we cuck to radical Islam?
[01:41:52.797 --> 01:42:00.384]  Okay, so Sweden has cucked to open borders, and now their country is being torn apart.
[01:42:00.384 --> 01:42:02.465]  Their culture is being ruined, okay?
[01:42:03.166 --> 01:42:08.508]  Trump, in his speech yesterday, mentions an incident in Sweden last night, and the liberals freak out.
[01:42:08.508 --> 01:42:10.509]  They're like, there wasn't anything last night.
[01:42:10.509 --> 01:42:11.089]  Oh, they trolled him.
[01:42:11.089 --> 01:42:13.129]  They said, nobody's raping women in Sweden.
[01:42:13.129 --> 01:42:14.330]  Muslims never do that.
[01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:17.831]  And they trolled him, made fun of his daughters, like he was a perv.
[01:42:17.831 --> 01:42:19.111]  And I think that's good to make fun of.
[01:42:19.111 --> 01:42:20.912]  I agree with the liberal media.
[01:42:20.912 --> 01:42:23.093]  To make fun of rape victims in Sweden is liberal.
[01:42:24.659 --> 01:42:29.662]  It was almost perfect because now they have to go look up... Now they actually had to look into Sweden.
[01:42:29.662 --> 01:42:31.322]  So Trump trolled them into... No, I agree.
[01:42:31.322 --> 01:42:33.403]  Like when he said, you never cover Islamic terror.
[01:42:33.403 --> 01:42:35.404]  And then they said, no, we do half the time.
[01:42:35.404 --> 01:42:36.585]  Oh, it didn't happen last night.
[01:42:36.585 --> 01:42:38.346]  It just happened every other night previous to that.
[01:42:39.258 --> 01:42:40.259]  Oh, so Trump was wrong.
[01:42:40.259 --> 01:42:41.579]  Owen, Owen, please.
[01:42:41.579 --> 01:42:42.540]  Trump was wrong, Alex.
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:42.900]  He was wrong.
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:44.982]  Look, I've got Pope Francis right here in the article.
[01:42:44.982 --> 01:42:47.423]  There was nothing last night, Alex.
[01:42:47.423 --> 01:42:50.565]  Muslim terrorism does not exist.
[01:42:50.565 --> 01:42:51.425]  Wait, what does Merkel say?
[01:42:51.425 --> 01:42:52.406]  I trust her.
[01:42:52.406 --> 01:42:53.587]  She said the same thing.
[01:42:53.587 --> 01:42:57.009]  She said Europe must take more refugees and Islam doesn't...
[01:42:57.788 --> 01:43:04.312]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:43:04.312 --> 01:43:07.554]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:43:07.554 --> 01:43:13.117]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:43:13.117 --> 01:43:19.241]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:43:19.241 --> 01:43:22.543]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:43:22.543 --> 01:43:23.964]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:28.486]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:43:28.486 --> 01:43:31.427]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:43:31.427 --> 01:43:33.088]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:43:33.088 --> 01:43:36.529]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:43:36.529 --> 01:43:39.130]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:40.191]  It's in powder form.
[01:43:40.191 --> 01:43:43.072]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:43:43.072 --> 01:43:43.772]  I take this.
[01:43:43.772 --> 01:43:45.593]  This is the product that I take.

[01:45:06.091 --> 01:45:09.272]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:45:09.272 --> 01:45:15.093]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:45:15.093 --> 01:45:20.795]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:45:21.215 --> 01:45:24.177]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.

[01:47:02.325 --> 01:47:04.946]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.583 --> 01:47:23.225]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.225 --> 01:47:27.188]  The final segment of this Sunday.
[01:47:27.188 --> 01:47:30.330]  Already the 19th day of February 2017 Global Transmission.
[01:47:30.330 --> 01:47:33.553]  Owen Schreiner is our guest in studio.
[01:47:35.757 --> 01:47:38.400]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:43.384]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:47:43.384 --> 01:47:44.145]  Waging War.
[01:47:44.145 --> 01:47:46.487]  Oh, it's beating the world.
[01:47:46.487 --> 01:47:52.613]  We've seen this incredible speech by Trump the day before that, coming out and saying the media is the enemy of the American people.
[01:47:52.613 --> 01:47:55.155]  The day before that, that big press conference.
[01:47:55.155 --> 01:47:55.996]  I mean, this is
[01:47:57.057 --> 01:48:00.580]  Historical, it's epic, it's crazy, it's wild.
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:07.485]  And then we see the job numbers for poor people, middle class, the small factory jobs, the small business jobs.
[01:48:07.485 --> 01:48:09.026]  I covered it earlier.
[01:48:09.026 --> 01:48:10.147]  They're exploding.
[01:48:10.147 --> 01:48:12.809]  There's one thing going right for Trump, the media says.
[01:48:12.809 --> 01:48:15.831]  There's more than that, but that's the article where they admit this.
[01:48:15.831 --> 01:48:17.232]  This is gigantic.
[01:48:17.232 --> 01:48:20.115]  Just to have somebody not out to get us.
[01:48:20.115 --> 01:48:21.416]  We're so used to being screwed.
[01:48:22.136 --> 01:48:27.858]  We just expect it's a self-fulfilling process that we should submit, but where do you see the world today?
[01:48:27.858 --> 01:48:29.319]  Where do you see this going?
[01:48:29.319 --> 01:48:31.199]  You know, it's interesting you ask me that.
[01:48:31.199 --> 01:48:32.720]  Where is it going?
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:36.441]  I didn't expect there to be that many protesters out there, to be honest with you.
[01:48:36.441 --> 01:48:38.602]  I thought that it was going to die down.
[01:48:38.602 --> 01:48:43.044]  You know, it seems to be getting less and less every time, but yet they were out in droves.
[01:48:43.044 --> 01:48:44.424]  They were intense.
[01:48:44.424 --> 01:48:45.445]  So was it a few thousand?
[01:48:45.445 --> 01:48:45.885]  A few hundred?
[01:48:46.325 --> 01:48:48.787]  I would say probably about 400, 500.
[01:48:48.787 --> 01:48:51.210]  But then you had like 9,000 got in.
[01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:54.313]  Thousands couldn't get in for Trump.
[01:48:54.313 --> 01:48:56.455]  Yeah, you had thousands of Trump supporters.
[01:48:56.455 --> 01:48:57.936]  It wasn't even close.
[01:48:57.936 --> 01:48:59.598]  He's rich and wants me to be poor.
[01:48:59.598 --> 01:49:00.719]  No, but think about this.
[01:49:00.719 --> 01:49:01.700]  You know what, Alex?
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.802]  And here's the thing, though.
[01:49:03.802 --> 01:49:06.264]  It all comes back to that story that I brought in.
[01:49:06.264 --> 01:49:07.585]  Bill Gates saying
[01:49:08.584 --> 01:49:11.225]  That tens of millions of people... Yeah, let's talk about that.
[01:49:11.225 --> 01:49:26.269]  Bill Gates has been caught in biological warfare, running eugenics, his dad a big eugenicist for the army, and he says, don't worry about nukes, bio-weapons are coming, but let me talk to world government, because they had a plan where Chelsea would run it, let me run things and I'll stop you all dying.
[01:49:26.269 --> 01:49:27.309]  Or who even knows?
[01:49:27.309 --> 01:49:28.610]  It could be some, you know...
[01:49:29.770 --> 01:49:35.758]  Techno cyber bioweapon and and who would you think might be able to develop or have the capacity to do something?
[01:49:35.758 --> 01:49:36.879]  I just trust Bill Gates.
[01:49:36.879 --> 01:49:40.044]  I think Bill Gates of hell so so
[01:49:41.553 --> 01:49:46.436]  I think that because our movement is so great, I mean, Alex, you've changed the world.
[01:49:46.436 --> 01:49:47.536]  And we've changed it together.
[01:49:47.536 --> 01:49:48.417]  Our listeners have.
[01:49:48.417 --> 01:49:48.837]  Our listeners have.
[01:49:48.837 --> 01:49:54.240]  And I always tell the people out there, I always tell the people out there, both the protesters who hate InfoWars, like, oh, you're fake news.
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:54.660]  I go, really?
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:56.261]  We just changed the world.
[01:49:56.261 --> 01:49:58.642]  And the same with the people who come up, they say, we love Alex Jones.
[01:49:58.642 --> 01:49:59.663]  Tell Alex Jones hi from me.
[01:49:59.663 --> 01:50:01.224]  They come, they shake me, and they say, we love InfoWars.
[01:50:01.224 --> 01:50:03.005]  I say, you guys changed the world.
[01:50:03.005 --> 01:50:05.346]  You guys changed the world.
[01:50:05.346 --> 01:50:10.829]  And the goal is obviously to rid ourselves of the people who have been screwing over not just America,
[01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.990]  Just a common man.
[01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:15.833]  Yeah, nobody's perfect, but the global issue is monopolies and control systems.
[01:50:15.833 --> 01:50:27.743]  So where we're at is a nexus point where enough people have woken up and taken action that within a few years, probably by the end of the Trump administration, we're going to really be able to
[01:50:29.355 --> 01:50:32.256]  Knock down some of these barriers that have been governing humanity.
[01:50:32.256 --> 01:50:32.616]  I agree.
[01:50:32.616 --> 01:50:33.357]  Let me ask you this.
[01:50:33.357 --> 01:50:44.621]  If they've got a bunch of beta failures, doesn't nothing mean, but they're like the worst, dumbest people you can imagine serving their globalist system and we're fighting back trying to have prosperity, where does it end?
[01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:45.441]  And that's what I think.
[01:50:45.441 --> 01:50:53.244]  Either we have this great victory and we take these shackles off of humanity that have been that have been holding us back for decades.
[01:50:53.244 --> 01:50:54.025]  We don't even know.
[01:50:54.025 --> 01:50:56.906]  I think, I mean, to the stars, literally to the stars, or
[01:50:58.188 --> 01:51:00.870]  A bioweapon kills, you know, 90% of the people on the internet.
[01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:01.131]  No, I agree.
[01:51:01.131 --> 01:51:05.454]  Bill Gates is saying, hey, I want to talk to world leaders about bioweapons about to be released.
[01:51:05.454 --> 01:51:06.455]  And maybe that's everybody.
[01:51:06.455 --> 01:51:10.339]  Everybody wants to be trendy and cool, just watch TV and buy into lies.
[01:51:10.339 --> 01:51:11.680]  Maybe it's time to lay down and go to sleep.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.561]  Maybe Bill Gates is right.
[01:51:12.561 --> 01:51:17.105]  Maybe he should go on and rule things and have a life extension and run things in the future.
[01:51:17.105 --> 01:51:17.585]  But you know what?
[01:51:17.585 --> 01:51:18.886]  I feel like... No, maybe Bill Gates is right.
[01:51:18.886 --> 01:51:19.387]  I'm going to be honest.
[01:51:20.387 --> 01:51:23.148]  Maybe it's time he released a bioweapon and kill everybody.
[01:51:23.148 --> 01:51:24.709]  Maybe he is.
[01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:25.829]  Maybe public doesn't care.
[01:51:25.829 --> 01:51:27.570]  They want to believe in him and love him.
[01:51:27.570 --> 01:51:28.350]  Maybe he's right.
[01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:32.872]  Maybe if we don't have a survival instinct to fight him, maybe it's time that he kill us.
[01:51:32.872 --> 01:51:38.294]  And that's actually probably how he looks at it, as far as he already looks at humanity like they've given up.
[01:51:38.294 --> 01:51:42.216]  He already looks at it like humanity's already... No, he sees us struggling and he's making a little threat right now.
[01:51:42.216 --> 01:51:46.878]  But I'm just saying, if the public won't stand up and take action, then just, you know, Bill Gates, love us.
[01:51:46.878 --> 01:51:47.418]  Give us your love.
[01:51:48.058 --> 01:51:48.918]  What do you think he would do?
[01:51:48.918 --> 01:51:53.401]  Do you think he'd use the Trump test to decide or do you think he'd just wipe us all out?
[01:51:53.401 --> 01:51:56.742]  They're figuring out how to do it and get away with it.
[01:51:56.742 --> 01:52:01.205]  And consolidate power and now they know it's all being looked at so they don't know what to do.
[01:52:01.205 --> 01:52:06.367]  It's like his wife two years ago said, everybody talking about how we're going to kill everybody is going to cause everybody to die.
[01:52:06.367 --> 01:52:07.168]  I made this analogy.
[01:52:07.168 --> 01:52:10.529]  Their argument is you give in and we're going to kill everybody.
[01:52:10.529 --> 01:52:13.531]  Listen, we're just figuring out how to kill all the third world people right now.
[01:52:13.531 --> 01:52:15.112]  You give in and we're going to kill all of you.
[01:52:15.939 --> 01:52:17.160]  It's like this.
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:28.884]  They're trying to burn humanity and what it's tried to create on this planet in liberty and freedom and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:52:28.884 --> 01:52:31.445]  It's trying to stop that.
[01:52:31.445 --> 01:52:34.687]  And while they burn essentially the world doing that,
[01:52:35.683 --> 01:52:45.109]  I always use this analogy, while the world burns, Bill Gates is lifting up on the hot air balloon and he's not dropping the ladder down.
[01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:49.992]  Zuckerberg thinks he's on that hot air balloon with the Pope.
[01:52:49.992 --> 01:52:52.894]  Alex is doing some nice art here.
[01:52:52.894 --> 01:52:54.616]  Actually, I've had Alex sing today.
[01:52:55.396 --> 01:52:58.858]  He's done comedy today and he's now done art today.
[01:52:58.858 --> 01:53:01.619]  So I've seen three talents of Alex Jones.
[01:53:01.619 --> 01:53:05.442]  I still want my paycheck next week, but I think that this is just worth the show right here.
[01:53:05.442 --> 01:53:07.543]  Just hearing you sing and everything.
[01:53:07.543 --> 01:53:09.504]  But Alex, I think that that's where we're going.
[01:53:09.504 --> 01:53:11.985]  And I think that Bill Gates, I don't know if it's a threat.
[01:53:11.985 --> 01:53:13.646]  I don't know if this is kind of what they do.
[01:53:13.646 --> 01:53:16.468]  You know that they like to show their hand before they play it.
[01:53:16.468 --> 01:53:20.150]  It's an arrogance move.
[01:53:20.150 --> 01:53:22.691]  Why don't you put a little piece of pizza on his thing too?
[01:53:22.691 --> 01:53:24.032]  Maybe he's like pizza.
[01:53:25.081 --> 01:53:27.043]  There's a lot of peace in this.
[01:53:27.043 --> 01:53:27.943]  I'm just saying.
[01:53:27.943 --> 01:53:29.905]  But you know what, Alex?
[01:53:29.905 --> 01:53:32.567]  I told you I want to do something for you.
[01:53:32.567 --> 01:53:38.731]  You talk about the dregs of society, okay, and the lowest of the low, in my opinion, are most of these protesters.
[01:53:38.731 --> 01:53:41.333]  Now there's probably one in about a thousand.
[01:53:41.333 --> 01:53:45.396]  I've probably talked to a thousand of these people, two thousand, three thousand, however many people I've come into.
[01:53:45.396 --> 01:53:48.399]  Every once in a while you get one that can actually hold a conversation.
[01:53:48.979 --> 01:53:54.823]  But you know, I go to these all-you-can-eat buffets of Trump protesters, Alex, and I eat a lot.
[01:53:54.823 --> 01:53:57.625]  And afterwards, I always brush with Super Blue.
[01:53:57.625 --> 01:53:58.786]  So I just want you to know that.
[01:53:58.786 --> 01:54:02.669]  Every time after- Well, it was sold out of the toothpaste, which is at incredible sales.
[01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:05.130]  We gotta get even more, but that's how we fund our operation.
[01:54:05.130 --> 01:54:06.171]  But, Owen, I appreciate you.
[01:54:06.171 --> 01:54:09.614]  Hey, seriously, though, Trump's speech is clearly
[01:54:10.974 --> 01:54:11.735]  How can people not like it?
[01:54:11.735 --> 01:54:13.236]  Did you see the economic numbers?
[01:54:13.236 --> 01:54:15.937]  Where like everywhere the small businesses are exploding?
[01:54:15.937 --> 01:54:18.118]  Did you see the video of the Joker?
[01:54:18.118 --> 01:54:19.900]  I talked to some guy out there in a clown outfit.
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:21.040]  Yeah, what was he doing?
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:25.523]  Okay, so he goes, first of all, he couldn't answer one question.
[01:54:25.523 --> 01:54:28.825]  This guy was a total dumbass, and I'm being polite, whatever.
[01:54:28.825 --> 01:54:30.386]  He's out there dressed up like the Joker.
[01:54:30.386 --> 01:54:32.867]  I mean, come on, how high could his IQ actually be?
[01:54:32.867 --> 01:54:33.348]  But anyway,
[01:54:34.068 --> 01:54:37.329]  He's like, well, did you see Trump's areas right there?
[01:54:37.329 --> 01:54:39.870]  I mean, really, this guy's IQ is probably like 28.
[01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:42.171]  That's why he's dressed up like the Joker.
[01:54:42.171 --> 01:54:43.231]  So good for him.
[01:54:43.231 --> 01:54:46.513]  But he's out there and he's like, whoa, didn't you hear Trump?
[01:54:46.513 --> 01:54:48.513]  Did you see that press conference?
[01:54:48.513 --> 01:54:49.914]  I'm like, yeah, I loved it.
[01:54:49.914 --> 01:54:51.074]  And he's like, well, what did you love about it?
[01:54:51.074 --> 01:54:55.616]  And I named off like the six things that I could recall immediately off the top of my head that I loved about it.
[01:54:55.616 --> 01:54:58.217]  And he's like, oh yeah, he just sounds like a seven-year-old.
[01:54:58.217 --> 01:55:01.578]  And I asked him, I'm like, oh, name one thing he did that sounded like a seven-year-old.
[01:55:01.578 --> 01:55:02.518]  Couldn't answer it.
[01:55:02.518 --> 01:55:03.819]  I was like, what did you not like about it?
[01:55:03.899 --> 01:55:04.601]  I couldn't answer it.
[01:55:04.601 --> 01:55:05.683]  No, it's sad though.
[01:55:05.683 --> 01:55:07.207]  These are delusionals.
[01:55:07.207 --> 01:55:08.309]  They don't have their own will.
[01:55:08.309 --> 01:55:10.194]  They just believe because they agree with MSM.
[01:55:10.194 --> 01:55:11.116]  They've been crushed.
[01:55:11.116 --> 01:55:13.601]  They must be empowered even though MSM is there to dominate them.
[01:55:14.411 --> 01:55:15.692]  They've been crushed.
[01:55:15.692 --> 01:55:17.673]  They have been absolutely crushed by the mainstream media.
[01:55:17.673 --> 01:55:24.138]  They've been absolutely crushed by the drugs, and the water, and the food, and the drugs, and the vaccines.
[01:55:24.138 --> 01:55:26.079]  They've been crushed, Alex.
[01:55:26.079 --> 01:55:27.020]  They've been crushed.
[01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:30.622]  But you have to crush the individual before you defeat it.
[01:55:30.622 --> 01:55:32.784]  That's the new globalist mindset.
[01:55:32.784 --> 01:55:35.626]  Because this is the fight they know they're going to get from humans.
[01:55:36.604 --> 01:55:40.648]  Human resistance is as old as probably humans.
[01:55:40.648 --> 01:55:47.175]  And that's why they're bringing in machines and all this is to make us absolutely under their control.
[01:55:47.175 --> 01:55:47.996]  Owen Schroyer.
[01:55:47.996 --> 01:55:51.179]  And now they're saying, oh, we need a universal income for machines.
[01:55:51.994 --> 01:55:54.756]  Yeah, and then a universal income the government directs the public.
[01:55:54.756 --> 01:55:57.058]  So you don't go to your own job or do your own life.
[01:55:57.058 --> 01:55:59.260]  We give you something somebody else made.
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:00.281]  Or build your own news network.
[01:56:00.281 --> 01:56:03.343]  It's all about, yeah, it's all about monopoly.
[01:56:03.343 --> 01:56:05.505]  And so we're not going to do that.
[01:56:05.505 --> 01:56:06.386]  We're winning.
[01:56:06.386 --> 01:56:08.067]  Trump has proven himself to be real.
[01:56:09.228 --> 01:56:19.456]  And just know this, Bill Gates is a horrible, globalist, eugenicist, who openly has declared war against humanity, and by exposing him, we're going to win.
[01:56:19.456 --> 01:56:21.517]  I'll be back, Lord willing, tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:56:21.517 --> 01:56:24.840]  Central Standard Time, with the four-hour weekday transmission.
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:33.346]  I want to thank Nico and all the rest of the crew, from Matt to Zach, the Lego maniac, for being here tonight.
[01:56:34.781 --> 01:56:36.983]  I want to just encourage you to know this.
[01:56:36.983 --> 01:56:39.906]  I don't get upset by you being successful.
[01:56:39.906 --> 01:56:41.888]  I get excited by that.
[01:56:41.888 --> 01:56:45.852]  The globalists want monopolies, so thank you all for your support.
[01:56:45.852 --> 01:56:48.074]  Please don't forget, we don't really have big sponsors.
[01:56:48.074 --> 01:56:50.897]  You hear radio ads and network ads that fund things for them.
[01:56:50.897 --> 01:56:57.863]  With us, it's just people going to infowarestore.com and getting the vitamins and minerals and supplements and the
[01:56:58.724 --> 01:57:07.048]  The non-GMO heirloom seeds and the products and the t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:57:07.048 --> 01:57:08.149]  We're not perfect.
[01:57:13.007 --> 01:57:20.374]  Myself and Owen don't have all the answers, but we don't want you to fall for us to succeed.
[01:57:20.374 --> 01:57:22.997]  And that's the big difference between good and evil.
[01:57:22.997 --> 01:57:25.420]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:30.385]  And Lord willing, if God has me here, because God's in control on this little planet going through space,
[01:57:30.925 --> 01:57:33.467]  And this spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy.
[01:57:33.467 --> 01:57:36.349]  I'll be back tomorrow, live, 11 a.m.
[01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:39.411]  Central, at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:39.411 --> 01:57:44.034]  Now spread this archived video, and ram it up the you-know-what of the globals.
[01:57:44.034 --> 01:57:46.396]  God bless you all, because there is a God.
