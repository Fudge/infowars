[00:00:21.363 --> 00:00:23.264]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:25.965]  It's Monday, August 7th, 2017.
[00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:27.266]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:28.607]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.629]  Tonight...
[00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:37.248]  How close are we to civil war?
[00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:40.110]  A warning to the New World Order.
[00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:45.355]  If Trump goes down, the silent majority will revolt.
[00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:51.480]  Then, Democratic-controlled cities like Baltimore descend into chaos.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.463]  As crime, the infrastructure, and the economy turn the inner city into a hellhole.
[00:00:58.703 --> 00:01:08.866]  Plus, leftist Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel gets triggered over President Donald Trump's quest to end sanctuary cities.
[00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:18.010]  And now, the city of Chicago says it will sue the Trump administration over the illegal migrant crackdown.
[00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.551]  All that plus much more, up next!
[00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:23.172]  On the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:38.601]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:56.913]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:57.674 --> 00:02:05.578]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:05.878 --> 00:02:15.102]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:15.882 --> 00:02:22.086]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:35.315]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:39.558]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists, we're getting results.
[00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:52.951]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support, because of you praying for the broadcast, because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:53.212 --> 00:02:58.858]  So please, secure your caveman today at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:24.316]  Well, the pot is starting to boil in the Lynch-Clinton-Comey collusion stew.
[00:03:25.253 --> 00:03:30.777]  And the Department of Justice has now released 400 plus pages of Lynch-Clinton meeting emails.
[00:03:31.217 --> 00:03:37.541]  This comes after James Comey of the FBI said no such records existed.
[00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:56.934]  The email she deleted.
[00:03:57.314 --> 00:04:00.476]  The FBI said earlier such records did not exist.
[00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:02.117]  Who lied there?
[00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:02.717]  Call me.
[00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:12.703]  The discharge of information is the result of a lawsuit filed against the DOJ by the American Council for Law and Justice in November 2016.
[00:04:14.984 --> 00:04:16.985]  Jay Sekulow is involved in that.
[00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:18.125]  You may have heard that name.
[00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:19.826]  He provides legal counsel to Trump.
[00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:22.267]  And so how about that?
[00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:28.210]  James Comey, again, it turns out to be a complete liar.
[00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.871]  That should surprise no one.
[00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:48.290]  But what is strange now, it's been revealed that Loretta Lynch used the alias Elizabeth Carlyle for official emails as Attorney General, including those related to her infamous tarmac meeting last summer with former President Bill Clinton.
[00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:54.076]  But apparently this is something that is commonly done, at least by liberals and Democrats.
[00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:59.400]  Eric Holder also used a codename, Lou Alcindor.
[00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:04.145]  But just imagine if Trump used a codename in his emails.
[00:05:04.185 --> 00:05:07.447]  Can you imagine if Trump used the pseudonym Babe Ruth?
[00:05:07.948 --> 00:05:10.270]  The liberals would be going crazy saying, what is he hiding?
[00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.991]  What is he hiding?
[00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:18.078]  Lynch used the alias to help craft responses to media requests about the meeting.
[00:05:18.598 --> 00:05:28.165]  Former IRS official Lois Lerner, who was at the center of the agency's targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, also used an alias, Toby Miles.
[00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:38.393]  The meeting came amid an FBI investigation whether Clinton's wife, then the Democrat presidential nominee, had revealed classified information when using private email servers while Secretary of State.
[00:05:38.733 --> 00:05:40.515]  Of course, she did.
[00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:41.756]  Comey admitted that.
[00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:54.038]  He also said that Lynch directed him to call the Clinton investigation a matter which worried and confused him, yet still no investigation or probe into Lynch yet.
[00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:58.237]  Loretta Lynch has now said she regrets having the meeting.
[00:05:58.297 --> 00:06:04.000]  No, Loretta Lynch, I think that you will regret having that meeting.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.321]  I think that you still got your nose in the air thinking you got away with something here.
[00:06:08.422 --> 00:06:16.685]  Someone who's not getting away with it anymore is another one of the chrome-domed swamp creatures, Brennan Clapper, and now add McMaster to that.
[00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:25.161]  Worked at Think Tank, backed by Soros-funded group that helped Obama sell Iran nuclear deal.
[00:06:25.201 --> 00:06:26.442]  This story is starting to go viral.
[00:06:26.863 --> 00:06:33.128]  White House National Security Advisor McMaster served at a UK-based Think Tank, financed by a Soros group.
[00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:43.878]  From September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster was listed as a member for the Institute of Strategic Studies, where he served as a senior fellow.
[00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:51.830]  That same institute was supportive of the Obama administration's deal with the nuclear accord with Iran.
[00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:59.716]  McMaster himself has been accused of purging the national security of hardliners on Iran and Trump supporters as well.
[00:07:00.857 --> 00:07:06.921]  And an archived version of the IISS donors page has Plowshares listed as a donor.
[00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:13.306]  Plowshares is financed by George Soros Open Society Institute.
[00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:25.261]  And also, speaking at a recent event held by Plowshares, former Secretary of State John Kerry implied that McMaster's is the best bet at keeping the nuclear agreement alive.
[00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:26.602]  Oh wow, shocking.
[00:07:27.102 --> 00:07:29.243]  No one would have thought that McMaster's
[00:07:30.163 --> 00:07:37.766]  The guy taking money from Soros groups, working for groups that take money from Soros groups that helped wrote the Iran deal, which was a terrible deal.
[00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:43.848]  And then John Kerry, another swamp creature, comes out and says, yes, McMaster's will help keep that deal intact.
[00:07:44.048 --> 00:07:46.748]  Oh, well, we'll make sure to keep McMaster's around then.
[00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:47.729]  Oh, that's so important.
[00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:53.631]  Let's move on to some domestic issues here with Sanctuary City's developing today.
[00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:57.742]  Spurred by Trump, states battle sanctuary cities.
[00:07:57.782 --> 00:08:00.045]  They just want to blame everything on Trump, not the illegal behavior.
[00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:07.672]  A growing number of proposed state laws designed to crack down on sanctuary cities are putting local leaders in those municipalities on their defensive.
[00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:14.468]  Forcing many to fight off measures they say could cripple their crime-fighting abilities and threaten economic growth.
[00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:16.050]  I find this hilarious, folks.
[00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:25.737]  We're talking about a policy that wants to follow the law, and specifically, we'll get to the session statement, wants to target criminals.
[00:08:26.678 --> 00:08:29.139]  But somehow they twist this and they say,
[00:08:30.157 --> 00:08:44.351]  That not having sanctuary cities is going to cripple crime-fighting abilities, even though sanctuary cities is adding to crime, and it's going to threaten economic growth, even though sanctuary cities literally sucks money from the government!
[00:08:45.112 --> 00:08:51.759]  I've never seen a more backward statement in my life from this NBC News garbage from Adam Edelman.
[00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:58.164]  I don't know if those are his words or who said that, but that makes no sense.
[00:08:58.285 --> 00:08:59.967]  Last month, Attorney General Sessions...
[00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:10.137]  Announced that cities stood to lose millions in future federal grant money if they don't help federal agents deport suspected undocumented immigrants held in local jails.
[00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:12.438]  He's talking about criminals!
[00:09:13.418 --> 00:09:22.061]  And yet they try to argue that stopping funding sanctuary cities will cripple crime-fighting abilities and threaten economic growth.
[00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:23.622]  It's the exact opposite!
[00:09:25.123 --> 00:09:26.005]  It's unbelievable.
[00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:34.581]  But now, certain cities like Chicago are suing the feds over their threat to pull funding.
[00:09:34.902 --> 00:09:35.663]  Now this is amazing.
[00:09:36.952 --> 00:09:45.654]  On Monday, Chicago is filing a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, which announced it would withhold millions of dollars in police grant money from so-called sanctuary cities.
[00:09:46.054 --> 00:09:52.295]  Rahm Emanuel is suing because he says new rules for federal fine-grinding grants go against the Constitution!
[00:09:52.996 --> 00:09:53.916]  The Constitution!
[00:09:53.956 --> 00:09:55.236]  These people don't even obey the law!
[00:09:55.616 --> 00:10:02.438]  Chicago will not let our police officers become political pawns in the debate, said Rahm Emanuel, even though that's exactly what he's doing.
[00:10:02.878 --> 00:10:03.698]  Rahm Emanuel
[00:10:05.006 --> 00:10:15.675]  Is putting non-citizens, putting illegal immigrants ahead of police officers and then using that argument as a political pawn.
[00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:21.040]  So Rahm Emanuel is such a piece of trash that he's going to use police officers as a pawn
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.424]  Then tell the Department of Justice they're trying to use police officers as a pawn.
[00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:31.851]  Meanwhile, he's putting non-citizen illegal aliens ahead of police officers and U.S.
[00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:32.331]  citizens.
[00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:34.794]  That's the type of piece of trash Rahm Emanuel is.
[00:10:35.114 --> 00:10:38.878]  Here was General Sessions on pulling Sanctuary City funding.
[00:10:39.912 --> 00:10:43.813]  Federal taxpayer dollars will help a city that refuses to help its own residents.
[00:10:44.153 --> 00:10:50.895]  The political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country's lawful immigration system.
[00:10:51.355 --> 00:10:59.957]  This is astounding given the unprecedented violent crime surge in Chicago with the number of murders in 2016 surpassing both New York and Los Angeles combined.
[00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:09.060]  This administration will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.461]  So it's this simple.
[00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:14.325]  Comply with the law or forego taxpayer dollars.
[00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:14.805]  Bingo!
[00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:15.786]  That's it.
[00:11:16.287 --> 00:11:17.768]  Rahm Emanuel wants to break the law.
[00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:20.131]  The government says you're not breaking the law anymore, Rahm.
[00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:21.012]  He says, really?
[00:11:21.032 --> 00:11:22.053]  Well then I'm gonna sue you.
[00:11:22.533 --> 00:11:24.355]  Good luck with that lawsuit, Rahm Emanuel.
[00:11:24.855 --> 00:11:32.183]  You know, it's really amazing the nerve Rahm Emanuel has to try to spin this thing
[00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:43.708]  And then put non-citizens, literally people that aren't even American citizens, people who came here illegally and are in jail over police officers and American citizens.
[00:11:44.148 --> 00:11:51.033]  Meanwhile, nobody's even going to hold his feet to the fire on the fact that homicide in Chicago is a daily routine.
[00:11:52.194 --> 00:11:56.197]  You cannot, I cannot hurl enough insults at Rahm Emanuel, so I'm just going to stop there.
[00:11:56.557 --> 00:11:59.960]  Let's move on to the leaking coming from the White House.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.921]  Now, this is pretty amazing.
[00:12:01.941 --> 00:12:03.162]  You have two different
[00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:07.124]  Arguments coming out about the leaking coming from the White House.
[00:12:07.564 --> 00:12:10.267]  First, let's go to Mad Maxine Waters.
[00:12:10.707 --> 00:12:13.210]  This woman's IQ gets lower every day.
[00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.271]  Here's Maxine Waters.
[00:12:39.474 --> 00:12:47.298]  So this lady's trying to make a point here that leaking's bad and Maxine Waters thinks it's good.
[00:12:53.341 --> 00:12:53.741]  So again,
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:08.590]  Another example of Democrats, we had an audio issue on our end there folks, sorry about that, but basically Maxine Waters is sitting here saying she's glad people are leaking, she wants to know what's going on, she needs to know, in fact, she said she needs to know what's going on.
[00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:17.677]  This is a woman, I'm not, I mean, folks, I feel bad, I don't want to come on here and insult an old lady who has dementia and Alzheimer's and is mentally deranged.
[00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:21.418]  That's not why I got into political news talk.
[00:13:22.118 --> 00:13:24.558]  But Maxine Waters wants to be in the battlefield.
[00:13:24.879 --> 00:13:26.039]  She wants to be in the ring.
[00:13:26.419 --> 00:13:30.960]  So if you want to put a corpse in the ring and tell us to fight, well then we're going to knock that corpse around.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:38.302]  So this woman is nuttier than a squirrel turd on here trying to tell you that you need to know what's coming out of the White House.
[00:13:38.342 --> 00:13:40.222]  You need to know it's good, it's healthy.
[00:13:40.642 --> 00:13:43.683]  She needs to know she's glad people are breaking the law and leaking.
[00:13:44.738 --> 00:13:45.078]  You know what?
[00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:48.001]  I'd like to see some of that medicine used against Maxine Waters.
[00:13:48.201 --> 00:13:52.805]  Hey, Maxine, how would you like it if people leaked everything that you did behind closed doors?
[00:13:52.845 --> 00:13:54.947]  How would you like it if people leaked all your conversations?
[00:13:55.207 --> 00:14:00.691]  Remember what happened when an independent journalist asked you about your Russian connection and the money between you and Russia?
[00:14:00.711 --> 00:14:01.272]  And what happened?
[00:14:01.512 --> 00:14:02.353]  You ran away!
[00:14:02.373 --> 00:14:04.755]  Because you're a coward and a fraud, Maxine Waters.
[00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:11.901]  Now, here's Bob Corker, a real American, not a coward, not a fraud, on how you should be addressing leakers.
[00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.295]  I was aware of the initial change that was getting ready to take place.
[00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:30.709]  I have encouraged the President, and now I'll encourage that through General Kelly, to fire every single person that's had anything whatsoever to do with backbiting, undermining other people for their own benefit, or leaking.
[00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:32.949]  And not to be cautious about it.
[00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.110]  If there's even a thought that somebody was involved, get rid of them!
[00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:42.672]  I mean, it is unseemly what is happening at the White House right now, or what has been happening.
[00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:45.232]  Again, it appears that General Kelly is taking charge.
[00:14:45.312 --> 00:14:49.093]  And I say this not to say anything against the first Chief of Staff.
[00:14:49.153 --> 00:14:51.554]  I don't know if he was ever given that authority in the first place.
[00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:56.175]  But to have people there that are leaking information
[00:14:57.802 --> 00:15:07.288]  That are talking to each of you to try to have their public policy implemented because they're getting you to argue on their behalf and we know it's happening.
[00:15:07.688 --> 00:15:09.129]  These people should be fired.
[00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:10.370]  They should be out of government.
[00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.233]  They're disloyal to our government and I hope that that's what's going to happen.
[00:15:15.134 --> 00:15:17.576]  Yeah, and I think that everybody is ready for that point.
[00:15:18.016 --> 00:15:29.766]  And just like that's how leakers and traitors inside the White House and inside the government need to be handled, this is how we, the Republic, the electorate, need to handle the 2018 midterm elections.
[00:15:30.166 --> 00:15:34.029]  If people like Pelosi and Waters and McCain and Blumenthal
[00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:41.094]  And all of these swamp creatures, Susan Collins, if they all get in again in 2018, then we really let Trump down.
[00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:42.235]  We really let ourselves down.
[00:15:42.255 --> 00:15:43.776]  We really, really let our country down.
[00:15:44.096 --> 00:15:49.400]  Because just like the leakers and traders in the White House, these are the leakers and traders in Congress.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.200]  Okay?
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.543]  So that is upon the American people to fix in 2018.
[00:15:53.863 --> 00:16:04.310]  So if we expect Trump to clean out the White House and drain the swamp, we better do the exact same thing in the midterms in 2018, or we don't have anything really to say.
[00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.611]  Now, this is an incredible story.
[00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:23.515]  Now, a month or so ago, there was a story in the Washington Post, another liberal rag, talking about how God and guns, how America took on Russia's tradition, when literally God and guns is like the tradition, the backbone, the root of America.
[00:16:23.575 --> 00:16:28.876]  The Washington Post is so confused, they pretend like that's Russia and us becoming Russia, literal madness.
[00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:30.777]  Now you have the New York Times
[00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:35.079]  Some crazy liberal Robert Schiller.
[00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:37.161]  The transformation of the American Dream.
[00:16:38.162 --> 00:16:41.725]  It really infuriates me how these liberals twist words and meanings.
[00:16:42.305 --> 00:16:43.547]  The American Dream is back.
[00:16:43.607 --> 00:16:45.789]  President Trump made that claim in a speech in January.
[00:16:45.869 --> 00:16:46.709]  That triggers liberals.
[00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.931]  They are ringing words, but what do they mean?
[00:16:49.032 --> 00:16:51.013]  Language is important, but it can be slippery.
[00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:52.295]  Consider that the phrase.
[00:16:52.535 --> 00:16:55.598]  The American Dream has changed radically through the years.
[00:16:56.298 --> 00:17:01.279]  No, only in your liberal warped mind, New York Times' Robert Schiller.
[00:17:02.199 --> 00:17:14.042]  In the United States, these values affect major government decisions on housing, regulation, Morgan's Guarantees, and millions of private choices regarding whether to start a business, buy an ostentatious home, or rent an apartment.
[00:17:14.522 --> 00:17:16.462]  No, see, that's where you're wrong, Robert Schiller.
[00:17:16.482 --> 00:17:20.063]  You started it off saying that these values affect major government decisions.
[00:17:20.993 --> 00:17:25.256]  No, see, the American Dream is that the government doesn't make our decisions!
[00:17:25.497 --> 00:17:27.598]  We make decisions without government!
[00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:28.699]  That's the dream!
[00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:29.720]  That's freedom!
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.921]  That's independence!
[00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.502]  But the liberals don't get it!
[00:17:33.563 --> 00:17:37.266]  Conflating the American Dream with expensive housing has dangerous consequences.
[00:17:37.586 --> 00:17:42.090]  So now he's insinuating that Trump and Carson are just saying that being rich and successful is the American Dream.
[00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.632]  The liberals really don't get it, folks.
[00:17:44.692 --> 00:17:49.596]  So he writes this whole story, conflating the American Dream with lust and power and greed.
[00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:58.985]  No, the American dream is being free to make your own decisions and to be as rich as you want, to have a big business, a big house, as big or small as you want.
[00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:02.047]  That's the American dream without government influence.
[00:18:02.368 --> 00:18:04.330]  The liberals don't get it.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:13.424]  You know, there was a story, a study that actually came out of the completely discredited University of Missouri, a liberal university that was once proud.
[00:18:13.444 --> 00:18:14.585]  I once attended there.
[00:18:14.605 --> 00:18:16.346]  It's a complete garbage university now.
[00:18:17.206 --> 00:18:19.007]  And they did a report on fake news.
[00:18:19.047 --> 00:18:19.747]  You know, it's just funny.
[00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:23.289]  They have the, that Drudge is listed as one of the most fake news sites.
[00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.971]  All Drudge does is link to other sites.
[00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:28.512]  That's how, that's how delusional these people are.
[00:18:28.552 --> 00:18:29.833]  They vote Drudge fake news.
[00:18:30.233 --> 00:18:32.955]  Drudge just links to other sites that they voted as trusted.
[00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:35.236]  So it's literally a complete joke.
[00:18:35.476 --> 00:18:36.616]  You want to talk about a complete joke?
[00:18:37.257 --> 00:18:39.257]  Tell me where the outcry is over this madness.
[00:18:39.638 --> 00:18:46.721]  Victoria's Secret had a children's, a young girl lingerie fashion show.
[00:18:47.541 --> 00:18:50.882]  I feel guilty even sharing the story and showing these images.
[00:18:51.183 --> 00:18:52.503]  This is disgusting.
[00:18:52.983 --> 00:18:54.264]  This is despicable.
[00:18:54.804 --> 00:19:00.026]  Victoria's Secret needs to be seriously looked at for having a children's lingerie model show.
[00:19:00.206 --> 00:19:01.347]  That is sick, man!
[00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:15.826]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:18.487]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:21.488]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:21.928 --> 00:19:23.129]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:23.869 --> 00:19:32.256]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[00:19:32.616 --> 00:19:34.578]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:35.058 --> 00:19:38.881]  Our formula at InfoWarsLife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:46.087]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity,
[00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:47.980]  And of strength.
[00:19:48.941 --> 00:19:52.324]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:52.744 --> 00:20:00.331]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched in Fuller's Life, to actually come up with this.
[00:20:01.132 --> 00:20:12.323]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:27.037]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:28.258]  You owe it to yourself.
[00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:38.848]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:38.908 --> 00:20:47.175]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:54.121]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the new world order.
[00:20:55.111 --> 00:20:58.895]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:59.355 --> 00:21:03.739]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslive.com.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.143]  I want to tell you about some of the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:08.163 --> 00:21:09.925]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:10.525 --> 00:21:12.707]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:17.031]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:30.183]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:30.863 --> 00:21:32.485]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:32.865 --> 00:21:35.688]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:35.708 --> 00:21:36.689]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:39.692]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:40.052 --> 00:21:42.454]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:42.895 --> 00:21:45.737]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:45.757 --> 00:21:47.399]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:52.884]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:52.904 --> 00:21:53.485]  Again,
[00:21:54.225 --> 00:21:59.952]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, you're absolutely insane.
[00:22:00.373 --> 00:22:04.698]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:05.278 --> 00:22:09.143]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:11.145 --> 00:22:13.868]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from Oz?
[00:22:13.888 --> 00:22:32.308]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:32.628 --> 00:22:35.451]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[00:22:35.491 --> 00:22:37.513]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:37.873 --> 00:22:39.875]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:40.336 --> 00:22:51.947]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:51.967 --> 00:22:55.070]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[00:23:12.745 --> 00:23:27.735]  Well, we know the innermost desire of the deep state is to remove President Trump from office, and the potentiality of civil war, if that happens, is becoming a serious talking point, especially in real news media.
[00:23:27.755 --> 00:23:37.962]  I'm now joined by an expert on the matter, Matt Bracken, the author of Enemies Foreign and Domestic, enemiesforeignanddomestic.com, former Navy SEAL.
[00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:39.123]  Matt, thank you for joining me tonight.
[00:23:40.796 --> 00:23:41.637]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:23:42.317 --> 00:23:44.198]  So Matt, you know the plot here.
[00:23:44.278 --> 00:23:45.939]  They're trying to remove Trump from office.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.541]  I brought it up on the Alex Jones Radio Show today.
[00:23:48.581 --> 00:23:49.802]  I'll ask you the same question.
[00:23:50.182 --> 00:23:53.644]  What do you think happens if they successfully remove Trump from office?
[00:23:56.066 --> 00:24:08.594]  Well, I think we've got a little bit of ground to cover between here and there because first they have to stand for all the Democrats will vote to impeach, but they have to stampede about a quarter of the Republicans in the House.
[00:24:09.398 --> 00:24:12.899]  Also, to vote to impeach, which I think shouldn't be too much of a problem.
[00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:16.559]  There are about that many, I think, that would go over to get him out.
[00:24:16.579 --> 00:24:19.340]  You know, there are state Republicans, plenty of them.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:34.183]  But I think in the lead up to that, there will have to be some pretty dramatic moves between Mueller and Comey, Rosenstein, McCabe, Baker.
[00:24:34.243 --> 00:24:35.883]  These guys are extremely corrupt.
[00:24:35.963 --> 00:24:36.323]  On top of
[00:24:37.978 --> 00:24:38.458]  We're good to go.
[00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:04.037]  Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised to see assassinations.
[00:25:04.758 --> 00:25:06.781]  I wouldn't be surprised to see people getting shot.
[00:25:07.082 --> 00:25:15.555]  So you think it's more likely that either Trump gets assassinated or perhaps other political figures get assassinated and they try to intimidate him out of office?
[00:25:16.325 --> 00:25:27.148]  Well, the thing is, the thing about acts of terrorism and assassination is that it'll be almost impossible to tell the false flags from the legitimate actions.
[00:25:28.308 --> 00:25:30.509]  False flags are used because they're effective.
[00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.349]  You know, they've been used to start many wars.
[00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:40.872]  The Nazis did it, you know, with fake actions across the border, blaming, you know, checks and polls for various things.
[00:25:40.932 --> 00:25:42.292]  Yeah, of course, the Reichstag.
[00:25:42.372 --> 00:25:43.292]  False flags work.
[00:25:43.332 --> 00:25:44.393]  The Reichstag fire.
[00:25:44.713 --> 00:25:45.593]  False flags work.
[00:25:46.333 --> 00:25:58.656]  And there are also a lot of very mentally labile, loose cannon nutjobs out walking around that just need anything to set them off.
[00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:06.797]  Oh, like the New York Times printing a story telling where the GOP baseball practice is and then nutbag moves out there and then shoots Steve Scalise.
[00:26:07.837 --> 00:26:08.378]  Exactly.
[00:26:08.518 --> 00:26:14.939]  And even more directed than that, you know, there are some people that think that they're in the hand of history.
[00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:22.498]  And people that study the internet and find these type of characters can actually, you know, help to guide and direct them.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:29.204]  Um, you know, going back in history, I think the James Earl Ray and the Martin Luther King shooting is probably an example of that.
[00:26:29.684 --> 00:26:37.390]  There's somebody that on his own probably wouldn't have shot Martin Luther King, but, you know, with help from guiding hands, they made movies out of this.
[00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.252]  There's a novel and a movie called The Parallax View that covers this pretty well.
[00:26:41.772 --> 00:26:44.694]  Um, Sirhan Sirhan who shot Robert F. Robert Kennedy.
[00:26:44.714 --> 00:26:52.840]  I think that's another example of a, you know, kind of an insane drifter, uh, who can be guided into, um, serving as a trigger.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.681]  And I think that we're very close to that.
[00:26:55.741 --> 00:27:12.710]  Now, I'm not going to say that it's going to be a true right-wing, somebody shooting somebody like a Mueller, or it'll be somebody who figures Mueller or Comey, they've about played out their usefulness, and the greatest usefulness that they can play at this point is to die for the cause.
[00:27:13.331 --> 00:27:19.135]  You know, the reason that this entire deep state coup trap has been set is out of desperation.
[00:27:19.976 --> 00:27:28.442]  The criminals in the FBI, CIA, and NSA, I would say, you know, Brennan for sure, Clapper, he's a fence-sitter, but very corrupt.
[00:27:28.642 --> 00:27:33.006]  At top floor of the FBI, incredibly corrupt, especially since Dior.
[00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:35.587]  I mean, these guys have a history going back 25 years.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.222]  It's just amazing that the controlled media isn't digging into this.
[00:27:41.622 --> 00:27:41.902]  Yeah.
[00:27:41.962 --> 00:27:48.405]  Mueller, Rosenstein, McCabe, Comey, they've been Confederates going back, you know, 25 years.
[00:27:48.926 --> 00:27:59.551]  I mean, back to the Ruby Ridge and Waco days when they, you know, changed the rules of engagement from FBI headquarters, directing the FBI HRT to basically take kill shots.
[00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:04.513]  The top floor of FBI is, you know,
[00:28:05.822 --> 00:28:09.144]  Like I said, it's distilled evil upwards.
[00:28:10.124 --> 00:28:25.773]  Mueller, in particular, during his tenure, he changed the way that the FBI promotions are run so that nobody can be promoted above a special agent in charge without going to Washington, which uproots people's families.
[00:28:26.494 --> 00:28:33.998]  Before that, they could have done a complete career in the FBI, staying outside of the corruption of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover building.
[00:28:34.751 --> 00:28:51.420]  What Mueller put in was sort of a military-style up-or-out system, where if the mid-level field agents didn't do a chore at FBI, which is where they're vetted for loyalty, being team player.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:51.580]  Right.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.921]  Loyalty to the deep state.
[00:28:53.741 --> 00:28:53.941]  Right.
[00:28:53.981 --> 00:28:55.882]  Loyalty to the Deep State.
[00:28:56.423 --> 00:29:03.487]  Under Mueller's tenure, there was basically a purge of mid-level FBI field agents, the ones with integrity in other words.
[00:29:04.548 --> 00:29:14.674]  The only ones that could get promoted after that are the ones that basically kissed the ring of the Deep State, bent their knee and genuflected and bowed
[00:29:15.294 --> 00:29:16.975]  To protect only the deep state.
[00:29:17.135 --> 00:29:18.976]  And it's so deep now.
[00:29:18.996 --> 00:29:21.558]  It's not just the FBI, NSA, CIA.
[00:29:22.118 --> 00:29:24.099]  Right inside the White House, McMaster.
[00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:26.140]  I mean, the guy is a Bilderberger.
[00:29:27.381 --> 00:29:37.847]  McMaster was at the June Chantilly, Virginia Bilderberg Conference, which is the biggest movers and shakers on the planet outside of Luxoris.
[00:29:38.107 --> 00:29:41.669]  Yeah, and the whole thing was how they were going to deal with Trump ruining the globalist agenda.
[00:29:42.546 --> 00:29:46.590]  Right, and even guys that you think are stand-up guys like Tom Cotton.
[00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:58.440]  Tom Cotton, a year ago, back in 2016, he was at the Sea Isles, Georgia, Karl Rove, you know, Never Trump, or How Do We Get Rid of Trump and Save the Deep State.
[00:29:59.001 --> 00:29:59.962]  There was Tom Cotton.
[00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:03.410]  And then now he's at Bilderberg.
[00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.831]  You know, Bilderberg is not about the speeches.
[00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:07.391]  You can read the speeches on the internet.
[00:30:07.411 --> 00:30:08.272]  Who cares about that?
[00:30:08.732 --> 00:30:10.512]  Bilderberg is about private meetings.
[00:30:10.972 --> 00:30:24.757]  Bilderberg is where the Senator Tom Cotton's are read into the program and learn that, you know, they're going to take the speed elevator to the top floor, but they're going to have to perform some services in order to get that.
[00:30:25.317 --> 00:30:31.140]  You know, so it's not a surprise to me to see Tom Cotton, for example, out in front on immigration.
[00:30:31.761 --> 00:30:34.282]  You know, he has to do that for cover, for legitimacy.
[00:30:34.342 --> 00:30:35.563]  It's called the bride price.
[00:30:36.063 --> 00:30:41.666]  When somebody's being a deep state stooge, they can't wear, you know, a George Soros button up here.
[00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.714]  They have to show the populist face.
[00:30:45.814 --> 00:30:47.315]  Oh, Tom Cotton, he's a good guy.
[00:30:47.355 --> 00:30:47.816]  Look at him.
[00:30:48.296 --> 00:30:51.119]  But something like immigration is a wave that's already coming.
[00:30:51.159 --> 00:30:53.081]  The RAISE Act, that's already coming.
[00:30:53.542 --> 00:31:03.673]  So letting Tom Cotton be the face of that is a way to give him cred and legitimacy when he's, you know, taking the call from the CEO of Goldman Sachs, when it really counts.
[00:31:04.313 --> 00:31:06.094]  And that's what Bilderberg is all about.
[00:31:06.134 --> 00:31:07.375]  That was just last June.
[00:31:07.975 --> 00:31:12.738]  You know, Tom Cotton, Clapper, Brennan, I'm sure they had a nice, quiet little discussion.
[00:31:13.139 --> 00:31:13.839]  McMaster.
[00:31:14.499 --> 00:31:17.361]  These guys are the essence of the deep state.
[00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:27.947]  I don't know if this is a case of Trump saying, you know, keep your friends close and your enemies even closer, or if McMaster is being played.
[00:31:27.988 --> 00:31:31.930]  But if McMaster is throwing out the counter-jihadists,
[00:31:32.541 --> 00:31:40.163]  And bringing back the, you know, the Mueller-Comey era jihad Islam apologist, this is a very bad sign.
[00:31:40.183 --> 00:31:45.744]  This means he's never going to really counter the Islamic program, ever.
[00:31:46.505 --> 00:31:49.325]  He's just another Obama-Soros stooge.
[00:31:49.906 --> 00:31:52.506]  And he's now our national security advisor.
[00:31:53.106 --> 00:31:58.808]  So as long as he's there, I wonder if they somehow have Trump in a checkmate position where
[00:32:00.106 --> 00:32:01.107]  Trump can't do anything.
[00:32:01.147 --> 00:32:04.649]  Just like with Comey and Mueller, it's the deep state coup trap.
[00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:10.333]  Rosenstein, McCabe, Baker, Mueller, Comey, they've put Trump in a trap.
[00:32:11.254 --> 00:32:16.077]  If Trump fires Mueller, he gets impeached.
[00:32:16.641 --> 00:32:17.782]  He doesn't fire Mueller.
[00:32:18.343 --> 00:32:32.235]  They've got 16, you know, Clinton, DNC-type lawyers data mining his entire past to make, you know, an operation program to release at the end as all the reasons why Trump is an unfit president.
[00:32:32.816 --> 00:32:34.838]  It's damned if you do it and damned if you don't.
[00:32:35.538 --> 00:32:39.162]  All that said, what we're getting to is, all right, so they forced Trump out.
[00:32:39.842 --> 00:32:41.444]  In that case, there's going to be shooting.
[00:32:42.145 --> 00:32:45.729]  The left has to know, they should know, they should be warned.
[00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.472]  If it won't go down smoothly, there will be shootings.
[00:32:48.552 --> 00:32:49.493]  That's Matt Bracken.
[00:32:49.513 --> 00:32:51.415]  Check him out, enemiesforeignanddomestic.com.
[00:32:51.455 --> 00:33:00.205]  And it sounds like you might think that they're trying to get ahead of that hot war by getting an assassination, some crazed lunatic to do an assassination first to bring in martial law.
[00:33:00.626 --> 00:33:01.627]  That's Matt Bracken, folks.
[00:33:01.647 --> 00:33:02.308]  Follow him on Twitter.
[00:33:02.348 --> 00:33:02.988]  He's the expert.
[00:33:03.008 --> 00:33:03.409]  Thank you, Matt.

[00:34:26.229 --> 00:34:33.793]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.

[00:34:44.279 --> 00:34:46.220]  And this part is most important.

[00:34:58.607 --> 00:35:01.368]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:35:01.408 --> 00:35:03.069]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:03.949 --> 00:35:08.352]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:08.432 --> 00:35:19.357]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:24.460]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.082]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:27.142 --> 00:35:28.643]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:28.863 --> 00:35:31.705]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:31.745 --> 00:35:36.508]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:36.528 --> 00:35:42.953]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:35:42.993 --> 00:35:48.276]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:50.017 --> 00:35:50.758]  This is so key.
[00:35:50.998 --> 00:35:53.319]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:55.299]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:57.420]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.002]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:04.386 --> 00:36:10.549]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:10.929 --> 00:36:13.811]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:14.151 --> 00:36:19.353]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:19.774 --> 00:36:25.737]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:25.877 --> 00:36:29.018]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:29.158 --> 00:36:30.599]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:30.819 --> 00:36:34.963]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:35.143 --> 00:36:38.026]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:38.106 --> 00:36:39.667]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:39.767 --> 00:36:42.970]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.553]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:45.833 --> 00:36:46.794]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:46.894 --> 00:36:49.596]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:49.776 --> 00:36:50.377]  I take this.
[00:36:50.497 --> 00:36:52.179]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:52.299 --> 00:36:54.260]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:55.081 --> 00:36:55.862]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:55.882 --> 00:36:56.722]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:15.176]  I'm now joined by Alistair Williamson from StockboardAsset.com.
[00:37:15.256 --> 00:37:17.997]  He has been covering what has been going on in Baltimore.
[00:37:18.117 --> 00:37:19.438]  All kinds of stuff going on there.
[00:37:19.458 --> 00:37:23.299]  The infrastructure collapsing, the economy collapsing, the housing market collapsing.
[00:37:23.579 --> 00:37:25.439]  They had a ceasefire over the weekend.
[00:37:25.719 --> 00:37:27.020]  That didn't last too long.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.580]  Alistair, thank you for joining me tonight.
[00:37:29.841 --> 00:37:30.581]  Owen, how you doing?
[00:37:31.104 --> 00:37:31.584]  Doing good.
[00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:34.366]  Well, you've got all your bases covered on the Baltimore stuff.
[00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:50.917]  There's a bunch of different scenarios breaking down and a lot of it that can be related to the larger picture where you can say, hey, look at what manufacturing or the lack of manufacturing jobs has done to Baltimore and how the regrowth in America could lead to the same regrowth in cities like Baltimore that have been dilapidated.
[00:37:51.978 --> 00:37:52.338]  Of course.
[00:37:52.539 --> 00:37:57.542]  And let me run you through what's kind of happening on a broader perspective, on a macro perspective.
[00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:08.542]  And then what we'll do is we'll tie that into a micro view of Baltimore, because Baltimore is really the model city of just what's happening and what is wrong with the United States.
[00:38:08.862 --> 00:38:17.811]  So I first want to start and understand that the distribution of wealth in the United States kind of topped off in the 1980s and early 1990s.
[00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:20.314]  And what happened there was the middle class started losing money.
[00:38:20.894 --> 00:38:27.078]  And the top 0.01%, the richest in America, started gaining and sucking money out of the middle class.
[00:38:27.318 --> 00:38:40.885]  And basically what we're saying, it's a structural takedown of the middle class, and it's to keep people dependent, it's to keep American citizens dependent on the system, impoverish them, and ultimately it's control.
[00:38:41.246 --> 00:38:45.508]  And in this time frame, we saw deindustrialization, we saw globalism,
[00:38:46.318 --> 00:38:53.828]  And you know, a lot of that has to do with also the Federal Reserve and the financialization of US markets and suppressing interest rates.
[00:38:54.484 --> 00:38:57.086]  Which really deprived Americans of savings.
[00:38:57.667 --> 00:39:06.353]  And you couple that all together and we can actually, and I have a bunch of notes here, you know, we're at a period in time today of big crossroads in America.
[00:39:06.774 --> 00:39:07.734]  And I have this right here.
[00:39:07.775 --> 00:39:16.501]  There's 96 million people out of the American workforce and we have an opioid crisis that is ravaging America.
[00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:20.825]  And let's not forget too that it was last week Janet Yellen says
[00:39:21.605 --> 00:39:30.209]  And responding to the lack of labor, or the people that aren't participating in the labor force, saying she thinks that a lot of that might be because they're addicted to opioids, they can't work.
[00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:47.658]  What's very interesting right now, and I'm going to reference the latest total non-farm payrolls here, what's happening right now is that we're seeing a lot of mixed matching skills and the job opportunity for Americans isn't like it was in the prior cycle.
[00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:58.845]  Even though the headline number last week in non-farm payrolls was 209,000, we see a majority of jobs in America being added to food services and drinking places.
[00:39:58.865 --> 00:40:06.114]  These are your bars and restaurants, your servers, your food runners, your bartenders that a majority of American jobs are going to right now.
[00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:18.091]  And overall, what we saw in the report was that little change over the month in July was added to major industries that are very productive, such as construction and manufacturing.
[00:40:18.111 --> 00:40:20.052]  And we're dealing with automation.
[00:40:20.092 --> 00:40:25.876]  We're dealing with major structural issues in America when it comes to the type of jobs out there.
[00:40:25.896 --> 00:40:28.117]  That's why we have subpar economic growth.
[00:40:28.698 --> 00:40:29.138]  I think?
[00:40:45.507 --> 00:40:54.114]  The roots of America, from the Industrial Revolution to the 1900s and to the 1940s and 50s, a majority of jobs were manufacturing.
[00:40:54.214 --> 00:41:00.159]  Actually, the employment share of jobs in America in the 40s and 50s, 30-40% of that were manufacturing jobs.
[00:41:00.179 --> 00:41:01.960]  Today, in America, that number is close to 8-9%.
[00:41:09.586 --> 00:41:14.369]  And that's exactly why we see Baltimore deteriorating at such a rapid pace.
[00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.871]  It's because she's missing her industries.
[00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:24.156]  We had, get ready for this Owen, we had the largest steel producer in the world called Bethlehem Steel.
[00:41:24.717 --> 00:41:35.844]  And it was due to the management made some bad decisions, but also globalism and shifting America's industries from America to overseas.
[00:41:35.984 --> 00:41:38.306]  And it's very unfortunate that that has happened.
[00:41:38.809 --> 00:41:42.391]  And that's been the biggest leading cause for these inner cities.
[00:41:42.431 --> 00:41:58.761]  I mean, anybody who's grown up in an inner city or lived there over the span of decades can see how you've got all these boarded up old manufacturing plants, you know, districts that used to be strong manufacturing areas, a lot of bustling with life, a lot of business, just gone, boarded up, fenced up, you know, completely impoverished.
[00:41:59.161 --> 00:42:00.022]  And it's amazing, too.
[00:42:00.922 --> 00:42:02.503]  My thought process just got going here.
[00:42:02.523 --> 00:42:02.784]  It's like,
[00:42:03.575 --> 00:42:08.879]  You know, we started a nation of farmers, and then throughout time we kind of moved on.
[00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:12.621]  We still had farmers and the farming industry, but then we had a nation of manufacturers.
[00:42:12.821 --> 00:42:13.822]  We were making goods.
[00:42:14.142 --> 00:42:16.864]  We were innovating different ways to manufacture.
[00:42:17.364 --> 00:42:19.446]  Then we had these unfair trade deals.
[00:42:19.486 --> 00:42:23.729]  We started to ship those jobs overseas for the betterment of international companies.
[00:42:23.749 --> 00:42:26.070]  They could make it cheaper over there, sell it more expensive here.
[00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.033]  And then it was like we came a nation of government assistants.
[00:42:30.433 --> 00:42:34.377]  We need government assistance in the inner cities, and that kind of seems to be where the circle is going.
[00:42:35.098 --> 00:42:41.385]  But it's amazing to me to think about, you talk about those job numbers mostly being impacted right now in the service industry.
[00:42:41.745 --> 00:42:49.414]  I'm just curious, do you think that's the type of thing where that's an immediate impact, where people start to spend more money, that indicates consumer confidence being up?
[00:42:49.714 --> 00:42:59.670]  Do you think maybe we start to see the manufacturing jobs come back once, you know, Foxconn builds a plant in Wisconsin and then the trends actually start to happen with the actual manufacturing plants being built here?
[00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.253]  Do you think that's something that might take a while?
[00:43:01.273 --> 00:43:03.036]  Or are you just not seeing it there yet?
[00:43:05.097 --> 00:43:05.538]  Two parts.
[00:43:06.259 --> 00:43:10.586]  First, I'm not seeing it there yet, especially with the recent job numbers.
[00:43:10.746 --> 00:43:16.435]  A majority of the jobs were allocated to restaurant and service industry, which is low productivity.
[00:43:16.755 --> 00:43:19.680]  Which the numbers are indicating is a booming industry right now.
[00:43:21.047 --> 00:43:33.410]  It is, but actually if you look at the sub-indices of like the S&P 500 or the Dow and you look at the actual restaurant stocks, that industry or that's the index itself has stalled out.
[00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:40.692]  So we're adding to an industry where the stock market of that industry is not going up at this moment.
[00:43:40.732 --> 00:43:44.453]  So it's quite confusing to many that we're, you know, we're adding all and actually
[00:43:45.174 --> 00:43:51.380]  Black Box Research, their research company out there, they are very bearish on restaurants.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:44:02.631]  It's quite interesting that we see a lot of jobs that are adding to this industry, but then there's research firms, and if you actually look at the sub-indecisies of restaurants, stalling out or just going bearish.
[00:44:03.172 --> 00:44:06.996]  What I think that's happening, and let's tie this back to Baltimore,
[00:44:07.648 --> 00:44:12.171]  What we're seeing, and in a lot of American inner cities, we're seeing shrinkage.
[00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:18.775]  We're seeing the American high that was in the 60s that topped out America.
[00:44:18.795 --> 00:44:20.236]  America topped out many years ago.
[00:44:20.256 --> 00:44:21.597]  I think we have to understand that.
[00:44:21.837 --> 00:44:32.683]  Because once we start understanding that America peaked, we can then understand the problems that are plaguing not just our society, but plaguing our inner cities or our economy.
[00:44:32.824 --> 00:44:36.666]  I think the issue and understanding that we as a nation
[00:44:37.006 --> 00:44:44.091]  We as citizens of America, we need to understand what's happening in our American inner cities and we cannot ignore.
[00:44:44.492 --> 00:44:52.618]  Let me tell you really quick here, a racial wealth divide initiative research paper that was out by JP Morgan this year,
[00:44:52.978 --> 00:44:54.638]  I was talking about Baltimore.
[00:44:54.798 --> 00:44:56.379]  Let me give you some of the highlights here.
[00:44:56.419 --> 00:44:59.720]  It's very concerning because we've ignored our inner cities.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.561]  The longer we ignore our inner cities, the longer it's going to take time to find a solution.
[00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:06.081]  Look, money is not the issue here.
[00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:11.723]  What the issue is that the central banks can't print and that you and I can never get back is time.
[00:45:11.763 --> 00:45:16.044]  We're wasting a lot of time ignoring what's happening in our inner cities.
[00:45:16.584 --> 00:45:21.305]  So here are some of the Baltimore highlights from this JP Morgan report called the Racial Wealth Divide in Baltimore.
[00:45:21.789 --> 00:45:27.450]  And what it's saying is that the population of Baltimore is 63% black, 28% white, and then other, it's about 9%.
[00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:36.192]  The medium wealth income, get ready for this, for the average white household makes nearly twice the income of an average black household.
[00:45:36.653 --> 00:45:42.954]  The unemployment rate, the unemployment rate of workers of color in Baltimore is three times the rate of white workers.
[00:45:43.034 --> 00:45:43.694]  Get ready for this.
[00:45:43.734 --> 00:45:51.276]  This is bad because this talks about, and I'm going to tie this in to the SNAP recipients, one third of
[00:45:51.954 --> 00:45:55.536]  African Americans have a zero net worth.
[00:45:56.877 --> 00:45:57.697]  How did we do this?
[00:45:57.977 --> 00:46:05.361]  How have we let our inner cities over 40 to 50 years literally deteriorate in front of us?
[00:46:06.322 --> 00:46:07.202]  Did we ignore?
[00:46:07.562 --> 00:46:08.483]  Did we just forget?
[00:46:08.503 --> 00:46:11.384]  Let's be very clear though.
[00:46:11.705 --> 00:46:12.925]  We've got 50 seconds left here.
[00:46:12.945 --> 00:46:13.826]  Let's be very clear.
[00:46:14.126 --> 00:46:17.868]  These are inner cities that have been run by Democrats for decades.
[00:46:18.464 --> 00:46:19.844]  Yes, and let me finish that up.
[00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:26.906]  So Baltimore is 50 years of Democrat-controlled, of the city mayor.
[00:46:27.126 --> 00:46:35.168]  And what they have done via globalization and globalism and all that stuff, they have depleted the town of its assets.
[00:46:35.268 --> 00:46:38.049]  Baltimore is a skeleton of industry today.
[00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:41.390]  It's very sad what Baltimore has transitioned to.
[00:46:42.351 --> 00:46:52.359]  And it's something that I really want to raise awareness of because if we start figuring out the problem in America's inner cities, we can then find solutions as a collective unit.
[00:46:52.419 --> 00:46:53.339]  It's the same thing in St.
[00:46:53.359 --> 00:46:54.901]  Louis, a lot of inner cities, Detroit.
[00:46:54.941 --> 00:46:57.343]  Thank you so much, Alastair Williamson, for joining us.
[00:46:57.383 --> 00:46:58.844]  Stockboardasset.com.
[00:46:59.124 --> 00:47:00.965]  Folks, the Democrats do not care about you.
[00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:02.547]  They don't know how to build economics.
[00:47:04.255 --> 00:47:09.038]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:09.698 --> 00:47:11.279]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:11.679 --> 00:47:16.682]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:17.022 --> 00:47:22.486]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:22.866 --> 00:47:29.470]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:31.251]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:32.111 --> 00:47:34.052]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:37.334]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:37.755 --> 00:47:41.397]  You gotta have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:41.577 --> 00:47:44.139]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:44.199 --> 00:47:56.547]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:56.747 --> 00:48:01.871]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and it's tainted.
[00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:03.492]  It's bound.
[00:48:03.613 --> 00:48:04.613]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:05.014 --> 00:48:05.454]  I tried it.
[00:48:06.034 --> 00:48:09.597]  And I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:09.818 --> 00:48:14.721]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:15.202 --> 00:48:20.106]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:20.186 --> 00:48:21.347]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:21.507 --> 00:48:24.089]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:24.189 --> 00:48:24.389]  Thank you.
[00:48:47.059 --> 00:48:49.701]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:50.761]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:51.082 --> 00:48:51.802]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:51.822 --> 00:48:52.442]  You must have it.
[00:48:52.803 --> 00:49:00.348]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:49:00.368 --> 00:49:01.228]  We can answer your questions.
[00:49:01.248 --> 00:49:01.288]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.106 --> 00:49:12.407]  Did an EPA official collude with Monsanto by tilting research?
[00:49:12.807 --> 00:49:16.548]  That is a question being asked right now in a lawsuit against Monsanto.
[00:49:16.948 --> 00:49:22.089]  Startling revelations abound thanks to some internal emails that have been made public.
[00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:24.110]  These are being called the Monsanto Papers.
[00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:35.312]  And now the EPA's Inspector General has actually launched an investigation into possible collusion between a former high-ranking EPA official and the biotech giant.
[00:49:36.024 --> 00:49:39.028]  Now joining me right now is independent journalist Jeffrey Jackson.
[00:49:39.428 --> 00:49:42.352]  And Jeffrey Jackson, you really delved into these Monsanto papers.
[00:49:42.452 --> 00:49:43.473]  Break it down for us.
[00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:49.340]  Give us kind of a brief explainer on some of the potentially incriminating revelations.
[00:49:50.211 --> 00:49:51.172]  Yeah, thanks Leanne.
[00:49:51.252 --> 00:49:56.716]  Well, the Monsanto papers are kind of like a mini WikiLeaks dump, but it's all aimed at Monsanto.
[00:49:57.236 --> 00:50:11.988]  So anybody can search these and where they came from was a discovery from a court case in San Francisco where over a hundred people have joined a large lawsuit against glyphosate for causing cancer to them and their loved ones.
[00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:13.109]  And the
[00:50:14.264 --> 00:50:20.767]  Court basically released the documents to the public on two separate occasions, one in March and then one just a week ago.
[00:50:21.308 --> 00:50:42.538]  So what's happening in these documents is people are sifting through them and they're finding the collusion between the EPA officials and Monsanto, the media and Monsanto, as far as ghostwriting articles for publications, and they're also finding that they actually haven't tested their products correctly or at all.
[00:50:43.038 --> 00:50:44.299]  It's absolutely stunning.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:46.700]  Right.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:51:00.006]  And some of the things that they are talking about there, being able to tilt this research in favor of glyphosate, they've never even actually did any carcinogenicity testing to determine that.
[00:51:00.206 --> 00:51:05.368]  And you actually talked to me a little earlier about some other key takeaways here, where we're kind of seeing how
[00:51:06.267 --> 00:51:09.809]  How far back does this collusion go where they're tilting the research?
[00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:16.073]  We are all quite familiar with that research there where we were seeing the rats with the tumors.
[00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:19.675]  Tell us a little bit about that and how this has kind of opened your eyes.
[00:51:20.556 --> 00:51:27.480]  Yeah, so it's just one small batch of the emails talks about that research was called the Cirellini Study out of France.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:35.545]  That was in 2012 and that was released in a journal called Food and Chemical Toxicology.
[00:51:36.306 --> 00:51:48.199]  And what happened after that is the paper was pulled by the journal and many people at that time said, you know, this is Monsanto's colluding with the journal, but a lot of these alternative outlets didn't have proof.
[00:51:48.239 --> 00:51:49.120]  So now we have proof.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:54.726]  So the month it was posted in the journal, it went public in the journal.
[00:51:55.286 --> 00:52:02.651]  The emails show that Monsanto signed a deal with a guy named A. Wallace Hayes, who was a well-known editor at that journal.
[00:52:03.112 --> 00:52:05.794]  So he was on Monsanto's payroll at that point.
[00:52:06.354 --> 00:52:18.983]  Hayes picked a guy named Richard Goodman, who basically came out of nowhere, was parachuted into the journal, and pushed to the head of the biotech area of the journal.
[00:52:19.403 --> 00:52:21.165]  And from there, he worked with Monsanto.
[00:52:21.205 --> 00:52:24.287]  Now, this Richard Goodman guy was an ex-Monsanto scientist.
[00:52:25.007 --> 00:52:35.637]  He worked with a Monsanto scientist to basically have a third-party expert letter to the editor campaign and eventually the Sirolini study was pulled.
[00:52:36.017 --> 00:52:46.447]  But the Sirolini study was legit and these emails show that Monsanto directly colluded to pull it with their journalists and their scientists.
[00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.991]  And that's just incredible.
[00:52:49.031 --> 00:53:02.083]  This is where people want to be really concerned with this because we see the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, again and again making these decisions that are just baffling, like allowing Dow Syngenta to
[00:53:02.861 --> 00:53:12.630]  Put their product, their pesticide product out on the market, even though the World Health Organization had just announced that bifurcate was a possible carcinogen.
[00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:19.716]  So then they moved away from that and they, without any real testing, allowed Dow Syngenta to put their product on the market.
[00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:24.060]  But of course, thanks to a lot of public outcry, they were forced to recant that.
[00:53:25.121 --> 00:53:39.541]  Back in 2015, but it makes you think about some of the other things that they're quietly approving without any public outcry, like just recently they approved Monsanto's RNAI, which is going to be a new type of
[00:53:40.296 --> 00:53:45.478]  Corn product where the genetic engineering technology is right inside of the corn.
[00:53:45.958 --> 00:53:51.421]  So they're doing all sorts of things quietly without giving the public any notice.
[00:53:51.841 --> 00:54:01.245]  And these Monsanto papers are revealing that there is major collusion going on between these biotech giants and the EPA.
[00:54:02.185 --> 00:54:04.686]  How can we trust anything that they're pushing through?
[00:54:05.703 --> 00:54:07.907]  Well, we can't, simply.
[00:54:08.487 --> 00:54:09.549]  You mentioned the EPA.
[00:54:09.729 --> 00:54:19.024]  There's a guy named Jess Rowland at the EPA, and he was an official, one of the head officials there, and he was caught in the first batch of Monsanto papers, emails in March.
[00:54:20.015 --> 00:54:28.383]  He was talking to a regulatory affairs chief at Monsanto saying, if I can kill this, I should get a medal, says Roland.
[00:54:28.803 --> 00:54:35.670]  And what he was talking about was a separate area of litigation, cancer litigation, against glyphosate.
[00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:41.273]  So, I mean, this is direct collusion and the EPA is kind of caught red-handed.
[00:54:41.494 --> 00:54:50.299]  There's also emails in these papers showing that the EPA was scrambling to find legitimate research that Monsanto did on their Roundup formulation.
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:58.425]  And this is in 2016 and 2015 when the EPA was trying to give it the green light and say it doesn't cause cancer.
[00:54:58.805 --> 00:55:02.327]  So they were directly working with Monsanto trying to find these studies.
[00:55:02.788 --> 00:55:03.808]  And here's the big secret.
[00:55:03.848 --> 00:55:04.869]  There are no studies.
[00:55:05.609 --> 00:55:23.815]  Monsanto's head toxicologist, her name is Donna Farmer, in one of the emails when she was talking to the Monsanto people, the head executives on how to sell glyphosate and Roundup, she tells them, quote, you cannot say that Roundup is not a carcinogen.
[00:55:24.075 --> 00:55:27.576]  We haven't done the necessary testing on the formulation to make that statement.
[00:55:28.056 --> 00:55:39.142]  So, in their own words, Roundup, and this is one of their most popular, if not the most sold and popular glyphosate herbicide wheat killer.
[00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:39.942]  My God!
[00:55:42.423 --> 00:55:51.048]  Right, and that goes back to that Seralini study as well, that they were using their own rats were kind of the control subject there.
[00:55:51.108 --> 00:55:53.389]  It was Monsanto's own
[00:55:54.156 --> 00:55:58.938]  Research, I guess, that was being used as the control where they could say, well, we didn't find anything like that.
[00:55:59.658 --> 00:56:02.019]  So we don't know what this guy is talking about with his rats.
[00:56:02.419 --> 00:56:16.223]  So again, they're not doing the actual research, but then they're making these sweeping new rules there with the EPA and putting these massive push for these products out on the market without any research to their long-term effects.
[00:56:16.984 --> 00:56:17.584]  And then lying!
[00:56:19.159 --> 00:56:19.659]  Absolutely.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.861]  You mentioned the new stuff that they're approving.
[00:56:22.881 --> 00:56:25.322]  This is my personal theory.
[00:56:25.342 --> 00:56:29.704]  I think Monsanto glyphosate is on its way out.
[00:56:29.784 --> 00:56:33.926]  There's over 1,100 lawsuits in other states now.
[00:56:34.226 --> 00:56:42.690]  1,100 people, I'm sorry, bringing suit against Monsanto for glyphosate cancer cases in other states, not just San Francisco, which is the one going on right now.
[00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.171]  So it looks to me that Monsanto is
[00:56:46.164 --> 00:56:55.032]  They can't hold on to this one, so they're going to probably sacrifice glyphosate and move towards the new RNA rewriting corn that was just approved.
[00:56:55.572 --> 00:57:02.278]  If the listeners don't know about this, Dr. Group did a great piece on it on InfoWars.
[00:57:02.298 --> 00:57:09.525]  All you have to do is type in GMO 2.0 on YouTube and Dr. Group's and Alex Jones' talk will come up on that.
[00:57:09.565 --> 00:57:12.868]  They did a really good overview of what this new generation of
[00:57:13.647 --> 00:57:15.167]  Of GMO corn does.
[00:57:15.427 --> 00:57:18.628]  It's absolutely horrific and we've got to keep an eye on it.
[00:57:19.348 --> 00:57:29.070]  Yeah, I mean, it's a major new threat developing and of course, like we're saying, they're doing all these things very quietly and only giving people about 15 days for public comment.
[00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:31.351]  Well, Jeffrey, we've just got about a minute left.
[00:57:31.871 --> 00:57:35.011]  Everyone can find your information at JeffreyJackson.com.
[00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:38.312]  Let people know what you're working on next and how they can keep in touch.
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:44.402]  Well, basically, I'm working on captured agency phenomenon and trying to spotlight that.
[00:57:44.502 --> 00:57:48.484]  So EPA, CDC, this is the swamp.
[00:57:48.544 --> 00:57:52.646]  This is the business end of the swamp that the people, the American people, are dealing with.
[00:57:52.926 --> 00:58:05.671]  And as Trump goes through and defends himself as a president with all the backstabbers that he's working with and are surrounding him, the American people are working to spotlight this end of the swamp of these captured regulatory agencies.
