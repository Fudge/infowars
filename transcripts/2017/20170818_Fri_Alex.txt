[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.416]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.783]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:38.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, hard to believe it's already Friday.
[00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:41.143]  Simply amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:43.785]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:46.066]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:50.069]  I'm coming to you from Seattle, which has been hit by
[00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:01.936]  Chemical narco-terrorism warfare by the big agri-companies, by the big pharma companies, by the globalists, where you have one of the biggest drug addict populations in the world.
[00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:15.705]  Wherever so-called liberal social engineers are in control, New York, Chicago, Seattle, you have giant homeless populations, you have a lot of working poor people, and their operating system is
[00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:21.330]  Hardcore leftists, anti-American, pro-Islamic ideology.
[00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:26.275]  Now, everywhere I go, I'd say 60-70% of people know who I am.
[00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:31.340]  And a lot of Japanese and a lot of Asian folks particularly are fans.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.863]  I'm talking about Japanese Americans, Chinese Americans.
[00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:36.424]  But when it comes to white,
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.466]  Men, white professional men, but also white working class men, it's about 50-50.
[00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:49.830]  People saying, F you, go to hell.
[00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:54.394]  And this has probably happened, I don't know, 30 times since I've been here, they'll walk by and say, F you.
[00:01:54.494 --> 00:02:01.380]  Or they'll point and laugh, like I'm in junior high and that supposedly gets to me and hurts me because they're a peer pressure group controlled by peer pressure and fake news.
[00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:07.906]  But I decided the next guy to come by and scream FU and stuff, that I was going to run over to him and say, no, no, no, do an interview.
[00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:11.869]  Well, that guy said FU and wouldn't talk to me.
[00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.230]  And I said, well, you have no intellectual debate.
[00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:20.917]  Then I'm walking back and a guy comes over and starts bumping his chest into me and says, I'm going to throw hot coffee in your face.
[00:02:20.957 --> 00:02:21.737]  He has it in a thermos.
[00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:26.716]  He unscrews it and then throws it in my face.
[00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:37.346]  And when I say that the people that tend to be on the front lines of globalist operation are goblins, I call them translucent skin goblins because they could be black, Hispanic or white.
[00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:38.748]  They have super white skin.
[00:02:39.168 --> 00:02:44.333]  They're always goblin shaped and they always jibber and giggle and revel.
[00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:49.017]  You know, we have all these tapes where they go, I love Satan, I love killing babies, I love killing my children.
[00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:52.379]  You know, we put a compilation together, and I call it goblining.
[00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:56.441]  And you notice in politics now, they say the swamp, or they say the goblin's nest.
[00:02:57.982 --> 00:03:00.664]  This has come into the nomenclature, it's come into the vernacular.
[00:03:00.684 --> 00:03:04.846]  And this just happened about an hour, what, about an hour and 15 minutes ago, Zimmerman?
[00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:13.032]  Michael is, you know, the camera guy, so he went down there with me, and I was experiencing all of this.
[00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:20.289]  And then right after I get attacked, a guy's filming me, and I walk over and I say, would you like to have some words with us?
[00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:20.910]  Very nicely.
[00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.734]  He goes, I don't talk to effing Nazis.
[00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:27.198]  So see, this is the most dumbed down population ever.
[00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.320]  They're just like Nazis.
[00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:40.447]  Where you literally just demonize, first, alt-right, Hillary creates the term, she's God, then they connect white supremacists to that, then you connect it to all whites, all conservatives, all libertarians, all free marketeers.
[00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.868]  And I've had folks celebrating that they plunged the stock market yesterday.
[00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:46.530]  We started the show out and I said every newspaper I saw,
[00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:49.162]  I've been out and around town yesterday morning.
[00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:53.905]  At least nine newspapers said, the stock market's going to plunge, the economy's dead, Trump's horrible.
[00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:57.567]  And I said, it's a concerted talking point to plunge the economy.
[00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:11.335]  Well, they plunged the stock market yesterday with the hoax that the head of his economic commission, Mr. Cohen, known as a whiz-bang at free market systems, they'd help, you know, turn on the Chinese economy, that he had resigned.
[00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:13.876]  Well, guess what?
[00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:15.017]  It was a hoax.
[00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:16.798]  So this is where we live.
[00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:21.657]  This is the system we have with people cheerleading their own destruction.
[00:04:21.677 --> 00:04:22.918]  But here's the big news today.
[00:04:23.732 --> 00:04:27.714]  We had attacks in Barcelona, killing 15 people, injuring over 200 now.
[00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:30.256]  And the number's going up of dead, unfortunately.
[00:04:30.516 --> 00:04:31.817]  We had another seaside attack.
[00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:32.638]  How do you pronounce the name?
[00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.219]  I don't have my computer open.
[00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:37.621]  Another seaside town had a bunch of folks they tried to run over.
[00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:40.803]  One cop shot down four jihadis who were also armed.
[00:04:41.283 --> 00:04:46.606]  And nowhere in USA Today, New York Times, I've got them all right here, will they call it an Islamic attack.
[00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:49.128]  They won't even call it terror until deep in the articles.
[00:04:50.245 --> 00:04:56.554]  Okay, so that's their systems of deception and control as the leftists attack me in a terror attack.
[00:04:56.874 --> 00:05:03.262]  These are bullies, that's why they're allied with radical Islam, because they're bullying thugs who want to dominate everyone and who want to control your kids.
[00:05:04.744 --> 00:05:06.325]  You cannot beat these deals.
[00:05:06.365 --> 00:05:08.306]  These are our all-time best deals.
[00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:10.607]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, 66% off.
[00:05:10.987 --> 00:05:12.688]  Mico ZX, 46% off.

[00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:24.635]  The BuzzFeed group promoting this said the best final of the B12 is $35 and that we're bad for selling it for $17.76.
[00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:30.198]  When ours is private-labeled by the very group, they chose to say, here's the best and here's Alex's.
[00:05:30.338 --> 00:05:32.359]  I mean, that's just providence that that happened.
[00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.980]  So BuzzFeed just says we are the best, the cleanest.
[00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.241]  We're just absolutely.
[00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.463]  And then they're just frothing, don't even know what to do.
[00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:39.863]  So please support us.
[00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:40.764]  As you know, there's a war.
[00:05:40.784 --> 00:05:42.045]  They're trying to shut everybody down.
[00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:42.885]  Please pray for us.

[00:06:32.898 --> 00:06:33.078]  Woo!
[00:06:33.138 --> 00:06:34.058]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:06:34.158 --> 00:06:42.760]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:52.122]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:18.348]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:08:19.088 --> 00:08:20.569]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:35.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am very honored to be with you live on this Global Friday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:37.424]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:41.126]  We have massive Islamic terror attack.
[00:08:41.246 --> 00:08:42.847]  ISIS took responsibility yesterday.
[00:08:42.867 --> 00:08:47.631]  It happened before yesterday's broadcast even began, but the media ignored it for much of the morning.
[00:08:48.231 --> 00:09:01.021]  We now know it's 15 dead, hundreds wounded, and then there was another attack in Cambrius on the coastline at a beach town, frequented by Americans as well, where they tried to run over people with another automobile.
[00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:08.147]  Islamists jumped out, screaming Allah Akbar, trying to shoot people, and one police officer shot all four of them down.
[00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:08.787]  I think?
[00:09:24.953 --> 00:09:32.635]  None of it said Islamic terror attack, but right next to it, it said right wing attack from Charlottesville, Virginia.
[00:09:32.675 --> 00:09:39.997]  So we'll never hear about the one woman that died and how every conservative or every gun owner or every libertarian, you murdered her.
[00:09:40.358 --> 00:09:41.498]  You are a Klan member.
[00:09:41.578 --> 00:09:42.318]  You are a devil.
[00:09:43.098 --> 00:09:44.579]  And literally here in Seattle.
[00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:52.370]  This morning I was walking to a local famous bakery to get some pastries for my family, by myself and my camera.
[00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.191]  I don't bring my kids out here obviously.
[00:09:55.072 --> 00:09:57.213]  With these vicious frothing leftists.
[00:09:57.954 --> 00:10:04.538]  And they just immediately saw me and I was doing a live feed about Barcelona and how the media was covering it up.
[00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.181]  And they began just going, F-U, F-U.
[00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:13.629]  So I told everybody, the next guy that walks by and says, F-U, I'm gonna walk over to him or run over to him and say, hey, tell us something on camera.
[00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:15.911]  And that guy said, F-U, F-U, and left.
[00:10:15.952 --> 00:10:18.895]  But another guy comes over, starts bumping into me.
[00:10:20.026 --> 00:10:20.666]  Over and over again.
[00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:43.036]  And just, it's this reveling in their weakness, reveling in their cowardice, reveling in their goblin-likeness.
[00:10:43.096 --> 00:10:46.836]  It's why people call it the swamp, well, it's populated with the goblin creatures.
[00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:51.877]  So that video is going viral on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:10:53.058 --> 00:10:55.278]  And I've had other folks tell me they want to kill me.
[00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:57.558]  And then they say, F you Nazi.
[00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:00.419]  And I saw another guy riding behind on his bike, he stopped.
[00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.890]  to go.
[00:11:17.117 --> 00:11:31.863]  And by Stephen Colbert and other imaginary friends you have that literally form a false relationship with you and then you have little alone celebrations in your little dank apartments on heroin, almost starving to death, just with roaches crawling on the walls.
[00:11:31.883 --> 00:11:33.163]  But it's okay, you've got Colbert.
[00:11:33.964 --> 00:11:37.025]  He's cool, he's good-looking, he's sharp, he's smart.
[00:11:37.085 --> 00:11:39.346]  He's a teleprompter character like Max Hedrum.
[00:11:40.137 --> 00:11:41.437]  He's literally just a creation.
[00:11:41.797 --> 00:11:47.899]  And then you've got the other actors posing as journalists who are really fake news, lying about what I say and what I do.
[00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:50.899]  And so it's very, very sad.
[00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:56.921]  I mean, actually, when he threw the coffee on me, luckily it's cold outside, so it burned at first, but, you know, dissipated in a second.
[00:11:57.501 --> 00:11:58.441]  I actually felt sorry.
[00:11:58.461 --> 00:11:59.541]  I was like, look at you.
[00:11:59.641 --> 00:12:01.442]  Look what a little goblin you are.
[00:12:02.162 --> 00:12:06.683]  And it was a lot of it was disgust, but also sadness that it's always the same.
[00:12:07.714 --> 00:12:09.595]  And it's not the obesity that makes him a goblin.
[00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:11.557]  They're very goblin-like.
[00:12:12.297 --> 00:12:14.199]  And always, like, they do this wiggle.
[00:12:14.219 --> 00:12:18.001]  This... This little wiggle thing they do.
[00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:23.305]  And then they... I always have bad breath and they're into... The women are into stinking and into the hideousness.
[00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:26.007]  And they're just like... Society's ours.
[00:12:26.087 --> 00:12:27.268]  We follow it.
[00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:28.849]  We have your kids in the schools.
[00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:29.869]  They literally chant this.
[00:12:29.909 --> 00:12:33.232]  I mean, I play MSNBC with them going, your children belong to us.
[00:12:34.032 --> 00:12:35.854]  And they just are this force of evil.
[00:12:36.574 --> 00:12:42.537]  You've got the kind of brain bugs, the higher caste that kind of control them and know they've enslaved them.
[00:12:42.898 --> 00:12:52.763]  Cynical sociopaths, cynical psychopaths, and even their minions now know they have no power, but they have the reflected glory of evil and the pulling down of civilization.
[00:12:52.783 --> 00:12:54.124]  That's why they serve Islam.
[00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.671]  It's why they love it so much.
[00:12:57.832 --> 00:13:11.120]  It's why they're so incredibly committed to it, is because the orthodox form of Islam is another bullying, controlling, dominating, annihilating, anti-beauty, anti-Western, beyond stone-age cult.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.022]  But here it is, vehicle rampage terrorizes another European city.
[00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:16.503]  Never does it say Islamic.
[00:13:16.583 --> 00:13:19.165]  It won't even tell you that ISIS took responsibility.
[00:13:19.785 --> 00:13:24.228]  Because again, Islam is a religion of peace, so everybody's trying to get out of it as fast as possible.
[00:13:25.413 --> 00:13:28.956]  Investigators surround damaged van after a driver smashed into crowds.
[00:13:30.717 --> 00:13:33.620]  So, you have to read deep in to find it was a human that did it in the car.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.922]  You'd think it was like Maximum Overdrive or Christine.
[00:13:36.942 --> 00:13:39.464]  This is all just, you know, it's the cars doing it on themselves.
[00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:47.591]  Yes, we have had some driverless cars actually kill people now, but then it goes on and I've got a shot of the New York Times.
[00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:51.034]  I was not going to pay $2 for it at the newsstand.
[00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:53.451]  Oh, here's PolitiFact.
[00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:57.573]  No backing for Alex Jones' Charlottesville theory that actors were there.
[00:13:57.893 --> 00:13:59.554]  I didn't even say actors were at this one.
[00:13:59.754 --> 00:14:00.655]  Turned out they were.
[00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:04.216]  I was talking about years ago confirmed crisis actors brought in.
[00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:11.560]  And now, officially Craigslist, official sites, and photos of their actors at Charlottesville all confirmed now.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.200]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.541]  But let me go to the other one.
[00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:14.881]  Here it is.
[00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:16.762]  Here's the New York Times.
[00:14:19.969 --> 00:14:24.652]  At least 13 killed in a vehicle attack on Spanish Street.
[00:14:25.373 --> 00:14:26.814]  So there's that.
[00:14:26.834 --> 00:14:27.974]  It keeps flipping upside down.
[00:14:28.255 --> 00:14:30.396]  But they just will not tell you it's an Islamic attack.
[00:14:30.656 --> 00:14:32.257]  Because that's their sacrament.
[00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:35.019]  Their religion is the kids belong to them.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.580]  The words belong to them.
[00:14:36.861 --> 00:14:41.744]  The encyclopedia and the lexicon and the thesaurus belongs to them.
[00:14:41.784 --> 00:14:42.705]  The vocabulary.
[00:14:43.025 --> 00:14:44.466]  They rule language.
[00:14:45.868 --> 00:14:47.008]  They rule culture.
[00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:48.609]  They rule it all.
[00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:54.691]  And they're going to advertise for crisis actors to quote, antagonize and agitate and cause a riot.
[00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:59.413]  You can go to the website of the company for Charlottesville and send them there and they're going to do it.
[00:15:00.313 --> 00:15:08.956]  And when we expose it, they're just going to say PolitiFact said Obamacare is free and 17 agencies unanimously said Russia was overthrew the election.
[00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:11.456]  And Hillary won the election.
[00:15:11.817 --> 00:15:37.157]  PolitiFact, ladies and gentlemen, they're gonna, because they, they are the gods, and they're gonna tell you at the FBI and CIA there's no such thing as Islamic terror, and they're gonna take it out of the lexicon, so that, and then the newspapers are gonna dutifully follow it, because it's a cult, where you write what you're told, you do what you're told, and in the very USA Today and New York Times, right next to it, right-wing terror, right-wing hate Charlottesville, see, right-wing,
[00:15:37.757 --> 00:15:44.167]  One death, it's right-wingers, every right-winger, every white person is absolutely, totally guilty.
[00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:47.851]  And the West is inherently bad.
[00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:48.652]  Wealth is bad.
[00:15:48.672 --> 00:15:49.772]  Just give it all to the elites.
[00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:50.932]  They'll have the jumbo jets.
[00:15:50.972 --> 00:15:52.193]  They'll have the carbon footprint.
[00:15:52.253 --> 00:15:52.693]  Al Gore.
[00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:53.633]  Barack Obama.
[00:15:53.693 --> 00:15:54.613]  You will have no car.
[00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:55.673]  You will have no air conditioning.
[00:15:55.974 --> 00:16:02.415]  And then you'll revel and gobbling around the streets and pour coffee on people that point out that they tried to crash the stock market yesterday.
[00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:04.796]  I'm out there going, they tried to crash the stock market.
[00:16:05.076 --> 00:16:06.396]  They won't cover Islamic attack.
[00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:07.076]  F-U!
[00:16:07.256 --> 00:16:07.396]  Ah!
[00:16:07.436 --> 00:16:07.817]  Coffee!
[00:16:08.117 --> 00:16:08.297]  Ah!
[00:16:08.337 --> 00:16:08.917]  Die, Nazi!
[00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:15.711]  And then just wiggle around going, oh, I'm going to look good to my two or three friends at the bar.
[00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:19.673]  We'll go and sit at the bar and then kind of leave and go up to our cockroach room.
[00:16:19.993 --> 00:16:21.634]  I'm not putting down that they live in little cockroach rooms.
[00:16:21.974 --> 00:16:23.615]  It's just that go to the little cockroach room.
[00:16:24.824 --> 00:16:28.186]  Go to the little heroin, you know, den, and then just sit there and just hate.
[00:16:28.366 --> 00:16:29.947]  And then the friend comes on, John Oliver.
[00:16:30.267 --> 00:16:31.068]  Oh, John Oliver's on.
[00:16:31.308 --> 00:16:32.708]  Oh, he's smart, reading off a teleprompter.
[00:16:32.929 --> 00:16:33.709]  He's so intellectual.
[00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.270]  So all this is coming up today.
[00:16:36.331 --> 00:16:39.472]  We also have Al Sharpton said, absolutely, take down Thomas Jefferson.
[00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:41.113]  Take down George Washington.
[00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:43.515]  Trump's totally correct, totally on target.
[00:16:44.415 --> 00:16:46.459]  Take down the pyramids, though, because the slaves built that.
[00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:53.230]  And, of course, the West got rid of slavery, but it doesn't matter, because Al Sharpton is the anointed god up on the hill.
[00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.031]  He tells you what to do.
[00:16:58.672 --> 00:17:01.296]  So all of this is unfolding, all of this is taking place.
[00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:07.364]  But don't worry, Wolf Blitzer and CNN and MSNBC all said, oh, this is copycats.
[00:17:07.945 --> 00:17:09.507]  Right-wingers did this.
[00:17:10.067 --> 00:17:12.511]  Yes, because of Charlottesville.
[00:17:12.971 --> 00:17:16.015]  It's not right-wingers copying Islamists at Charlottesville.
[00:17:16.676 --> 00:17:17.897]  It's Islamist discourse.
[00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:18.917]  They don't say Islamists.
[00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:21.058]  They just say, this is probably a right-winger.
[00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:26.541]  This is probably an alt-righter that actually say that that's probably who did this.
[00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:31.404]  So let's bring in Owen Schroyer to give us his amazing take on this.
[00:17:32.064 --> 00:17:33.345]  Again, terrorist attacking.
[00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:38.248]  The left loves radical Islam because it supports violent overthrow and bullying and authoritarianism.
[00:17:39.068 --> 00:17:43.692]  Well, it's amazing that you're here filing a legitimate report on real issues, a real report.
[00:17:59.785 --> 00:18:04.606]  And it's so instrumental or illustrative of exactly what Trump is dealing with.
[00:18:05.007 --> 00:18:12.729]  Here you are filing a real report saying, hey look, we had radical Islamic terror here, but they're ignoring that and they're trying to say that there's right-wing terror in America.
[00:18:14.589 --> 00:18:15.970]  And then you get interrupted.
[00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.891]  This guy comes up to you, says racist, F you, pours coffee on you.
[00:18:20.171 --> 00:18:23.212]  You get interrupted in the middle of an important report, an important breakdown.
[00:18:23.772 --> 00:18:27.154]  That is exactly what the Democrats and the media are doing to Trump right now.
[00:18:27.514 --> 00:18:29.415]  He's like, hey look, we're in a trade war with China.
[00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:31.076]  Hey look, we got open borders.
[00:18:31.436 --> 00:18:33.377]  Hey look, we got North Korea threatening.
[00:18:33.397 --> 00:18:34.178]  Hey look, we got all this stuff.
[00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:35.398]  And they're like, racist!
[00:18:35.658 --> 00:18:36.679]  Racist monuments!
[00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:37.459]  F you!
[00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:38.040]  Russia!
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:38.360]  This!
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.241]  And it's just totally distracting from what he's trying to actually do.
[00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:44.423]  And they're also celebrating going, yay the stock market fell!
[00:18:44.603 --> 00:18:45.564]  F Trump and America!
[00:18:45.604 --> 00:18:46.064]  Screw it!
[00:18:46.324 --> 00:18:47.305]  Rule the pension funds!
[00:18:47.325 --> 00:18:48.165]  We don't want jobs!
[00:18:48.205 --> 00:18:48.865]  Screw it!
[00:18:49.106 --> 00:18:49.606]  Yeah!
[00:18:50.086 --> 00:18:51.647]  I mean, they just love being failures.
[00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:57.912]  Alex, I think that the stock market thing is centered around keeping Cohn in and getting Bannon out.
[00:18:58.452 --> 00:19:08.239]  And if you think about it, the perfect analysis of what you're saying is, how could Bannon getting out or in, or Cohn getting out or in, affect the stock market?
[00:19:08.259 --> 00:19:09.080]  Why would that affect it?
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.561]  That just shows you how it's all rigged.
[00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:11.402]  I mean, that's the proof!
[00:19:12.142 --> 00:19:17.205]  Sure, what they did was the exuberance has pushed it up, even though the Federal Reserve wants to drive it down now.
[00:19:17.506 --> 00:19:19.207]  They've been raising interest rates to push it down.
[00:19:19.507 --> 00:19:22.749]  People know, though, tax cuts will actually get the market going more.
[00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:24.450]  So they believe it's going to go up.
[00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.352]  But even with the regulation cuts, it's made it go up.
[00:19:27.412 --> 00:19:28.453]  So we're open for business.
[00:19:28.773 --> 00:19:30.674]  So finally, we're taking the stock market back.
[00:19:30.714 --> 00:19:34.377]  The Globalist had it in all the newspapers yesterday and all over that it was going to plunge.
[00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:46.714]  Artificially plunge it so they could then try to sit there and say, look, look, look, you know, Trump's shine is wearing off in a test ahead of assassinating Trump.
[00:19:47.034 --> 00:19:52.698]  They want to kill his name, his credibility and his boom economy first before they put the bullets in him.
[00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:57.801]  But we're raising the alarm here, exposing the deep state's plan to kill our American president.
[00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:03.084]  And look at all these sad, idiot, useful fool traitors in the streets that hate someone.
[00:20:03.604 --> 00:20:04.485]  We're listener supported.
[00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:19.277]  BuzzFeed tested our supplements and found they were totally clean, but tried to lie and say, but we overcharge, not knowing the very company that they had had tested other supplements and then was selling them, recommending it as the best vitamin B12 in the country, when that's who we private label from.
[00:20:19.897 --> 00:20:23.160]  So we're calling it the BuzzFeed Special.
[00:20:24.417 --> 00:20:26.638]  But now, the BuzzFeed piece is gone.
[00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:28.900]  They're writing derivative pieces that are even more deceptive.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.421]  So they're trying to shut us down.
[00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:33.403]  So when you fund us, you're getting high-quality products in front of the tip of the spear.
[00:20:33.663 --> 00:20:41.428]  So I'm combining last month's specials with this month's 1776 specials and calling it the BuzzFeed Special.
[00:20:42.148 --> 00:20:43.529]  Rain Force, 55% off.
[00:20:43.569 --> 00:20:47.712]  Survival Shield X2, which you really need if there's a nuclear war, but it really blocks the bad halogens.
[00:20:47.732 --> 00:20:49.273]  So it's the regular use that's great.
[00:20:49.653 --> 00:20:53.236]  Not just the radioactive item, but it blocks the chlorine, bromide,
[00:20:54.016 --> 00:20:54.777]  Fluoride, you name it.
[00:20:55.018 --> 00:20:57.982]  For Bible Shield X2, they said, we tested it, it's pure iodine.
[00:20:58.483 --> 00:21:02.789]  It's not sodium iodine, it's not potassium iodide, or iodate, it's just pure iodine.
[00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:07.636]  Acting like that's a bad thing, they know full well, it's super hard to get the deep earth crystals totally pure.
[00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:11.910]  In the gaseous form and then put it safely into palm oil.
[00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.230]  They know this is proprietary.
[00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.431]  It's so hilarious.
[00:21:15.231 --> 00:21:17.671]  Super Blue, toothpaste is off massively.
[00:21:18.012 --> 00:21:24.773]  Caveman, Alexa Pure, Alexa Breeze, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Knockout, Sleep Aid, DNA Force.
[00:21:24.833 --> 00:21:28.154]  We're talking 55 to 66% off across the board.
[00:21:28.554 --> 00:21:29.555]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:31.035 --> 00:21:36.100]  Now this will go through the rest of the month, but obviously some of these are going to have to stop selling because they're going to sell out.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.203]  X2, because a lot of folks are buying it because of the nuclear war threat.
[00:21:41.244 --> 00:21:43.886]  Iodine, good iodine is flying off the shelves all over the country.
[00:21:43.906 --> 00:21:46.389]  You can search the engine, iodine flying off the shelves.
[00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.890]  You name it.
[00:22:16.929 --> 00:22:23.393]  And that's why whether it's comedy shows, award shows, Hollywood, TV entertainment, the news, it doesn't matter.
[00:22:23.734 --> 00:22:31.759]  It's all focused in one anti-American, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-gun voice.
[00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.300]  And it gets worse.
[00:22:33.661 --> 00:22:44.752]  These ruthless social engineers have an iron grip on our educational system and are teaching our children to hate America and that our president is worse than Hitler and needs to be assassinated.
[00:22:45.233 --> 00:22:52.300]  But as America reawakens, these powerful, deep state, rogue government forces are beginning to panic.
[00:22:52.981 --> 00:23:05.326]  They've even got the former president on television and in the news, and traveling to foreign countries, bad-mouthing America, bad-mouthing sovereignty, and calling for resistance to our elected president.
[00:23:05.806 --> 00:23:17.711]  In a last-ditch effort, mainstream media is now legitimizing the use of violence against anyone that opposes the globalist takeover, and against anyone who's actually trying to make this nation great again.
[00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:30.556]  They are absolutely intensifying their efforts, screaming homophobe, xenophobe, racist, to make them march, to make them go out on the streets and assault viciously anyone trying to exercise their free speech.
[00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:38.880]  International criminals like George Soros are openly pushing for civil insurrection in America that will lead to civil war.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:46.325]  The beatings, the stabbings, the shootings, the burning cars, the looting of shops, the execution of police officers.
[00:23:46.945 --> 00:23:57.152]  All of this leads to the destabilization, to the martial law that the deep state and the globalists say they need to bring in their final takeover of America.
[00:23:57.852 --> 00:24:02.055]  We are America, and we are the Infowar.
[00:24:18.663 --> 00:24:21.844]  And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder.
[00:24:24.145 --> 00:24:26.986]  Before we ever pass this way again.
[00:24:27.186 --> 00:24:29.226]  And we're gonna ride.
[00:24:47.807 --> 00:24:50.188]  It's hard to turn off old Johnny Cash, isn't it?
[00:24:50.268 --> 00:24:53.470]  Ride like the one-eyed jack of diamonds.
[00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:59.132]  With the devil close behind.
[00:25:00.653 --> 00:25:02.194]  You know the great news, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:25:03.499 --> 00:25:29.713]  The globalists have taken me and created a false straw man, and put all these horrible words into this straw man's mouth, but more and more people, everybody that was focused, that was thinking, that had clear eyes, from white homeless men, to Japanese-American business owners, to young women, to old women, to you name it, came over and shaked my hand on live video feeds.
[00:25:30.828 --> 00:25:33.392]  They have great points to, you know, talk about.
[00:25:34.454 --> 00:25:35.596]  They're aware of what's happening.
[00:25:35.616 --> 00:25:36.658]  They're giving me info.
[00:25:37.419 --> 00:25:43.429]  They ran into an RNC staffer telling us about all this stuff, how they were stealing the delegates from Trump under orders of Priebus.
[00:25:44.555 --> 00:25:45.156]  Just incredible.
[00:25:45.196 --> 00:25:46.178]  He's got that snake in there.
[00:25:46.198 --> 00:25:47.099]  We already knew they did that.
[00:25:47.119 --> 00:25:48.080]  We were just hearing it from the guy.
[00:25:48.721 --> 00:25:50.063]  And then you see the people that hate us.
[00:25:50.223 --> 00:25:55.530]  I mean, they look like they have had their soul sucked out and they know they're unhappy.
[00:25:55.951 --> 00:25:57.232]  They know they're serving evil.
[00:25:57.573 --> 00:26:01.157]  And they hate you because they know you're good.
[00:26:02.162 --> 00:26:03.382]  And they don't want to hear the truth.
[00:26:03.902 --> 00:26:05.363]  They don't want to know how they were lied to.
[00:26:05.383 --> 00:26:06.303]  They don't want to be freed.
[00:26:06.683 --> 00:26:08.123]  They want to hate you.
[00:26:08.143 --> 00:26:10.644]  And they want to enjoy hating you.
[00:26:10.664 --> 00:26:16.825]  And they want to dehumanize you and just laugh and giggle and punch you and pour coffee in your face.
[00:26:17.725 --> 00:26:25.047]  Because they're just absolutely super, super sad conformist.
[00:26:26.621 --> 00:26:29.564]  Conforming to hardcore evil psychological warfare.
[00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:36.672]  Now, on the next long segment, I'm going to play CNN and MSNBC saying that this was a Charlottesville attack in Spain.
[00:26:37.453 --> 00:26:37.733]  That's right.
[00:26:37.753 --> 00:26:38.394]  It's not Islamic.
[00:26:38.414 --> 00:26:39.335]  They will not say that word.
[00:26:39.635 --> 00:26:41.958]  They will connect it to American conservatives and libertarians.
[00:26:43.564 --> 00:26:44.285]  That is what they will do.
[00:26:45.086 --> 00:26:49.270]  I had left this run up last night on live feeds and say that, uh, no, I'm wrong.
[00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:50.011]  I'm fake news.
[00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:52.233]  Muslims do not attack people in Barcelona.
[00:26:52.954 --> 00:26:54.776]  And they said, we know there was an attack, but it wasn't Muslims.
[00:26:54.796 --> 00:26:56.298]  And then they giggle and they laugh.
[00:26:56.578 --> 00:26:59.701]  And then they point at me, ridiculing like it makes me feel bad.
[00:27:00.142 --> 00:27:03.005]  And it makes me feel bad that they're so dehumanized and so mentally ill.
[00:27:04.844 --> 00:27:06.206]  I mean, it's like going back to junior high.
[00:27:06.226 --> 00:27:08.268]  They never... But actually, it's nerds.
[00:27:08.629 --> 00:27:13.575]  And it's always arrested development, people that have never worked out in the fields, never been in a fight.
[00:27:14.296 --> 00:27:15.037]  They're soft.
[00:27:15.597 --> 00:27:17.500]  And they just think everything's like make-believe.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.501]  It's very sad.
[00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:20.443]  I don't feel good that our opposition...
[00:27:21.864 --> 00:27:24.325]  He's such a mentally ill, cowardly, chicken neck scum.
[00:27:25.065 --> 00:27:28.067]  And are so violent because they tell us, we're going to assault you.
[00:27:28.087 --> 00:27:33.189]  In fact, I'm going to play the clips where CNN and MSNBC say, we're allowed to attack the alt-right or anybody else.
[00:27:33.889 --> 00:27:36.130]  Conservatives or Nazis, the President's a Nazi.
[00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.511]  We're going to attack and we're going to kill the President.
[00:27:38.831 --> 00:27:40.052]  And we're going to blow the economy out.
[00:27:40.072 --> 00:27:41.392]  And by the way, your kids belong to us.
[00:27:41.613 --> 00:27:42.533]  We're going to sexualize them.
[00:27:43.473 --> 00:27:47.495]  And they're the ruling class of a big mob of cowards and weird perverts and people.
[00:27:47.755 --> 00:27:48.335]  And they rule!
[00:27:48.455 --> 00:27:48.876]  They rule!
[00:27:49.136 --> 00:27:51.517]  And they know we're finally saying, get off our back, gremlin.
[00:27:52.057 --> 00:27:52.737]  Get off our back.
[00:27:54.418 --> 00:27:55.379]  So that's all coming up.
[00:27:56.459 --> 00:28:04.223]  And then PolitiFact says, no proof there were any actors at Charlottesville, even though... What's crazy is I'd never said that.
[00:28:04.323 --> 00:28:06.964]  I'd said we'd seen actors at other events that had been in the news.
[00:28:07.224 --> 00:28:08.425]  And then it turns out there were.
[00:28:09.478 --> 00:28:10.219]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:10.259 --> 00:28:10.919]  We're gonna do that.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.840]  But PolitiFact is a total fraud.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.881]  It will never correct itself.
[00:28:14.241 --> 00:28:16.863]  If you want disinfo, go to Snopes, funded by Soros.
[00:28:17.123 --> 00:28:18.244]  Go to PolitiFact if you want.
[00:28:18.564 --> 00:28:20.826]  I mean, they'll do some fact-checking on stuff that doesn't matter.
[00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:23.308]  Like, you know, what's the price of tea in China?
[00:28:23.628 --> 00:28:24.809]  They'll give you something accurate on that.
[00:28:24.829 --> 00:28:28.211]  But when it's real info, oh, Hillary's gonna win by 15 points, PolitiFact.
[00:28:28.571 --> 00:28:30.212]  You know, healthcare's free, PolitiFact.
[00:28:30.913 --> 00:28:32.194]  You can keep your doctor, PolitiFact.
[00:28:33.093 --> 00:28:39.696]  Of 17 agencies that amicably say Total Proof Russian Narrative, PolitiFact, just literally, toilet paper has a use, PolitiFact doesn't.
[00:28:40.736 --> 00:28:54.382]  PolitiFact, the name in fraud, the name in arrogant pompous nose up in the air, these little factoids with their name PolitiFact in little cubicles, you know, what's the government say, what's the PR firm say, oh let me, oh yeah.
[00:28:56.639 --> 00:29:01.742]  Continuing though, we're running this special but it's got to end early next week because a lot of these things are selling out.
[00:29:01.763 --> 00:29:05.145]  I had to end last month's John Oliver special because a lot of the stuff sold out.
[00:29:05.165 --> 00:29:07.506]  A lot of it came back in.
[00:29:07.827 --> 00:29:13.550]  Then I combined it with this month's 1776 special when BuzzFeed put out their big fraud piece that blew up in their face.
[00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:19.094]  They had to admit cleanest level, you know, in the United States, California standard level of our products.
[00:29:19.734 --> 00:29:23.457]  No metals, just cannot detect them, just unheard of, total over the top.
[00:29:23.957 --> 00:29:24.337]  Of course.
[00:29:24.417 --> 00:29:28.300]  And just, oh, our vitamin B12 is the very best rated top in the country.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.762]  But they showed ours and said ours was clean and good, but overpriced.
[00:29:31.942 --> 00:29:34.364]  And then they showed the very same people we private label for, for $35.
[00:29:34.944 --> 00:29:35.564]  Ours is $17.76.
[00:29:36.345 --> 00:29:37.045]  Total victory!
[00:29:37.105 --> 00:29:37.666]  Ha ha ha!
[00:29:37.926 --> 00:29:41.868]  Just absolute, absolute lobotomized idiots.
[00:29:41.888 --> 00:29:42.269]  We're fighting.
[00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:45.451]  So, Brain Force, 55% off.
[00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:47.433]  Survival Shield X2, 55% off.
[00:29:47.473 --> 00:29:48.754]  Secret 12, 55% off.
[00:29:48.994 --> 00:29:50.256]  That's the bottom of the B12.
[00:29:50.276 --> 00:29:52.237]  Bio-Truth Selenium, it's $17.76.
[00:29:52.518 --> 00:29:54.119]  Silver Bullets, 66% off.
[00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:55.841]  Infowarsore.com.
[00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:59.344]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.763 --> 00:30:15.893]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[00:30:16.074 --> 00:30:23.440]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWarsLife family, true whey protein from InfoWarsLife.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:29.706]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high-quality organic conditions.
[00:30:30.267 --> 00:30:37.013]  Our True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life contains a whopping 20 grams of protein per serving.
[00:30:37.474 --> 00:30:44.641]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[00:30:44.821 --> 00:30:57.492]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies to bring you a super high quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[00:30:57.992 --> 00:31:05.559]  That way you get the benefits and the taste of high quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[00:31:05.879 --> 00:31:08.401]  Doing our research, one thing continues to really stand out.
[00:31:08.941 --> 00:31:17.606]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:18.827]  That is essential.
[00:31:19.207 --> 00:31:23.510]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:26.431]  This is the very best whey that we were able to bring to market.
[00:31:26.812 --> 00:31:28.493]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[00:31:28.513 --> 00:31:30.254]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.
[00:31:30.774 --> 00:31:33.296]  It is true whey from mfulwardslife.com.
[00:31:34.505 --> 00:31:39.409]  DNA Force is finally back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:32:58.138 --> 00:33:01.819]  And again, thank you for making the InfoWar possible.
[00:33:02.199 --> 00:33:03.579]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:33:12.387 --> 00:33:18.654]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:26.523]  She might be straight.
[00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:30.252]  You might want the money.
[00:33:30.532 --> 00:33:31.473]  I really do care.
[00:33:32.193 --> 00:33:35.994]  All right, I'm gonna stop butchering as long as we come in and getting serious.
[00:33:36.034 --> 00:33:42.795]  But I do have a lot of adrenaline pumping because it's so ridiculous when you actually face the forces of Goblinville.
[00:33:43.836 --> 00:33:49.337]  I mean, when you go out and you see the goblin creatures for yourself, and then you'll see the beta-cut males.
[00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:57.314]  Literally bowing to their wife and always pushing the stroller, which it's fine if the guy's pushing the stroller and carrying the diaper bag and being part of taking care of stuff.
[00:33:57.334 --> 00:33:59.175]  I'm not into gender roles like that.
[00:33:59.215 --> 00:34:01.417]  As a grown-up, you know, I took care of my sister.
[00:34:01.457 --> 00:34:02.958]  You know, my parents both took care of me.
[00:34:03.498 --> 00:34:05.899]  I take care of my babies quite a bit, but I'm at work most of the time.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.802]  But I do have a 13-week-old baby daughter right now.
[00:34:11.052 --> 00:34:20.434]  But the men literally, like, walk behind their wives and they grovel, and then when they see me, they point and laugh, but the wife's real serious and she stands in front like, that's the dangerous Alex Jones.
[00:34:20.954 --> 00:34:40.499]  And you come to a place like Seattle, and then you see normal families just out having a good time, and it's like, man, these people are in a cult, and they're all wanting to adopt every little affectation of it to symbolize that they're properly going with the social engineering, and the new social engineering
[00:34:41.932 --> 00:34:46.635]  Is telegraphed down every few months the new way to act, the new way to behave.
[00:34:47.195 --> 00:34:52.458]  And we told you, next it'll be George Washington, next it'll be Thomas Jefferson.
[00:34:52.478 --> 00:34:55.820]  They're going, absolutely we're taking down Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:03.045]  Vice tweets out, one of the biggest media outlets out there, and says let's blow up Mount Rushmore.
[00:35:03.805 --> 00:35:10.930]  Okay, are we going to blow up Mecca because Mohammed had slaves?
[00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:13.590]  And advocated that blacks weren't human.
[00:35:14.531 --> 00:35:16.772]  In the Quran, they're called raisin heads.
[00:35:17.973 --> 00:35:21.575]  And they say they're not human, so you can sell them.
[00:35:21.615 --> 00:35:23.056]  We learned the slave trade from them.
[00:35:23.437 --> 00:35:25.178]  England ended the slave trade, but that doesn't matter.
[00:35:25.558 --> 00:35:31.902]  Because to the social justice warriors, they want to go around and just say everybody's racist as a political power.
[00:35:31.922 --> 00:35:32.583]  But I want to say this.
[00:35:32.723 --> 00:35:38.507]  I've had more black people who had their eyes pointed straight, looked like they were in good shape, dressed nice,
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:46.043]  Coming off work, doing things in business suits, you name it, but also just in their jogging outfits, mob us.
[00:35:46.103 --> 00:35:47.024]  A lot of them on video.
[00:35:47.604 --> 00:35:50.786]  Well spoken, focused, they know what they're doing, they know what they're talking about.
[00:35:51.186 --> 00:35:56.409]  Some liberal cities you go to, you got white zombies, Hispanic zombies, black zombies, but you'll see a lot of, you know,
[00:35:57.169 --> 00:36:01.390]  Black goblins, white goblins, Hispanic goblins, mixed goblins, zombified, stumbling around.
[00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.632]  I've not seen many black zombies while I've been here in Seattle.
[00:36:06.692 --> 00:36:10.013]  It's mainly really whacked out, freaked out looking.
[00:36:10.893 --> 00:36:11.854]  Zimmerman's over there nodding.
[00:36:11.914 --> 00:36:13.594]  Just totally whacked out white people.
[00:36:13.994 --> 00:36:15.074]  They look really unhappy.
[00:36:15.094 --> 00:36:15.855]  They look freaked out.
[00:36:16.095 --> 00:36:16.855]  And it's not just me.
[00:36:16.955 --> 00:36:25.758]  I'll sit there and watch them through windows and stuff at restaurants and they're just really pissed and really... And this is a really violent town once a riot starts and stuff.
[00:36:27.261 --> 00:36:38.250]  A lot of pissed off heroin heads, a lot of burnouts, a lot of, you know, old gay guys that life didn't deliver like it was supposed to for them, and they're really, really, really, really, you know, bitter.
[00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:39.831]  Banning out at the White House.
[00:36:39.911 --> 00:36:42.293]  We have a drudge siren.
[00:36:42.813 --> 00:36:45.475]  Roger Stone told me Monday that he was definitely going to be out.
[00:36:45.515 --> 00:36:46.456]  He said by Friday.
[00:36:46.476 --> 00:36:50.940]  Of course, we said that on Monday, that the word was he'd be out by Friday, just showing how accurate we are.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.401]  That's why they call us fake news.
[00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:55.683]  We have the vaunted siren at DrugsReport.com.
[00:36:57.099 --> 00:36:59.500]  So let's screenshot that, folks, and tweet that out.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.381]  That Bannon out at the White House.
[00:37:01.421 --> 00:37:03.122]  Let's screenshot that image, tweet it out.
[00:37:03.322 --> 00:37:05.363]  Real Alex Jones, Bannon out at White House.
[00:37:06.503 --> 00:37:11.146]  We are live, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:37:11.186 --> 00:37:12.326]  A lot of folks go, tweet it yourself.
[00:37:12.446 --> 00:37:13.307]  I can't when I'm on air.
[00:37:13.347 --> 00:37:15.268]  It's like chewing gum and, you know, kicking ass.
[00:37:16.728 --> 00:37:18.069]  And I'm all out of bubble gum here.
[00:37:18.689 --> 00:37:20.930]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's hard to chew gum and do the broadcast.
[00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.751]  It's hard to tweet and do the broadcast.
[00:37:23.372 --> 00:37:24.032]  But there you go.
[00:37:24.072 --> 00:37:26.173]  Let's actually click on that article, if you guys can.
[00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:28.379]  I don't know.
[00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:53.013]  I didn't even know he was in Naval Intelligence until they tried to pull his security clearance.
[00:37:54.254 --> 00:37:57.156]  I guess they did, or they're like kicking him out or something.
[00:37:57.196 --> 00:38:01.400]  As it said, the President tweets him, and then it's like, good God, get him out of the Navy!
[00:38:01.701 --> 00:38:03.282]  A Commander-in-Chief tweeted him!
[00:38:03.963 --> 00:38:05.785]  Oh God, he can't be in our Navy!
[00:38:05.805 --> 00:38:08.247]  The Commander-in-Chief likes him!
[00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:14.253]  Literally, that was the headlines two days ago was, Jack Postobic's in Naval Intelligence.
[00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:17.905]  I was at Mount Rainier when I learned Posobiec was here.
[00:38:17.925 --> 00:38:20.768]  He's like, hey, I'm here to protest the Lenin statue.
[00:38:21.268 --> 00:38:22.309]  And I looked up the Lenin statue.
[00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:22.930]  It's private.
[00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:24.231]  The guy thought it was historical.
[00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:25.632]  He saved it from the Soviet Union.
[00:38:26.152 --> 00:38:32.818]  I think you ought to have a museum of Hitler statues, Stalin statues, Martin Luther King statues, Benjamin Franklin statues.
[00:38:32.838 --> 00:38:34.139]  It doesn't matter whether they're good or bad.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.300]  It's statues.
[00:38:36.241 --> 00:38:40.465]  Now, if a city or county wants to vote a citizen to remove something from a park, I think that should be their right.
[00:38:43.499 --> 00:38:47.162]  It's just, so I'm not even saying, and I don't disagree with the Pacific overall, but I get his point.
[00:38:47.463 --> 00:38:48.944]  He's saying, okay, take this one down too.
[00:38:49.465 --> 00:38:50.966]  No, I say leave the Lenin statue up.
[00:38:50.986 --> 00:38:52.367]  I mean, it's history.
[00:38:52.387 --> 00:38:54.589]  I'd like to be able to see an original statue from the Soviet Union.
[00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.132]  But he said he was there, and they've got video, I guess.
[00:38:57.372 --> 00:38:58.693]  People saying, we're gonna kill you.
[00:38:59.334 --> 00:39:00.775]  Chanting, death, death, death.
[00:39:00.835 --> 00:39:04.458]  I mean, this is so fascist by the Antifa.
[00:39:04.659 --> 00:39:05.539]  They're so violent.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.641]  And that's all the President's saying.
[00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:09.043]  I just got hit with hot coffee.
[00:39:10.757 --> 00:39:11.758]  I just got a text, and it was.
[00:39:11.799 --> 00:39:12.419]  He goes, hey, this is hot.
[00:39:12.459 --> 00:39:13.220]  I just loaded it up.
[00:39:13.581 --> 00:39:14.602]  He unscrews the thermos.
[00:39:14.662 --> 00:39:14.983]  Boom.
[00:39:15.323 --> 00:39:17.025]  Thank God it was like 60 degrees out there, 55.
[00:39:17.126 --> 00:39:22.112]  It was cold, because it just, in the heat, it hurts some, but big deal.
[00:39:22.132 --> 00:39:23.714]  It's not my first rodeo.
[00:39:25.436 --> 00:39:28.797]  And then he just said, I'm going to hit you with a thermos.
[00:39:28.837 --> 00:39:29.937]  I just said, go ahead, man.
[00:39:30.017 --> 00:39:31.057]  Just do it, dude.
[00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:32.137]  You got power, man.
[00:39:32.157 --> 00:39:34.398]  You're going to make my kids talk the way you want.
[00:39:34.418 --> 00:39:35.738]  You're going to run my life.
[00:39:35.758 --> 00:39:36.898]  You're going to take my guns.
[00:39:36.918 --> 00:39:38.198]  You're going to raise my taxes.
[00:39:38.759 --> 00:39:39.679]  You love to be miserable.
[00:39:39.699 --> 00:39:41.139]  You want to plunge the stock market.
[00:39:41.759 --> 00:39:43.659]  You want to cover up for the jihadis that are pouring in.
[00:39:43.939 --> 00:39:45.100]  I mean, that's your agenda.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.180]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.360]  And I'm not backing down.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.440]  But Stephen Bannon out.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.401]  I got a bunch of clips I want to play as well.
[00:39:50.761 --> 00:39:51.521]  Senior advisor.
[00:39:52.506 --> 00:39:52.966]  Moving on.
[00:39:53.027 --> 00:39:53.667]  Impressive run.
[00:39:54.027 --> 00:39:57.331]  The Drudge Report has learned populist hero may return to Breitbart.
[00:39:57.831 --> 00:40:04.757]  So he better come on my show now because he always gives leftist interviews, I guess, to look nonpartisan or whatever.
[00:40:05.198 --> 00:40:17.129]  The three or four interviews he gave the last eight months since Trump was president-elect, nine months, were with, you know, a Hollywood reporter and some liberal thing the other day explaining that
[00:40:18.493 --> 00:40:21.695]  You know, he thinks that the white supremacists are clowns.
[00:40:21.835 --> 00:40:23.316]  And that's a good way to describe it, clowns.
[00:40:23.876 --> 00:40:25.697]  Out there clowning around in their little outfits.
[00:40:26.637 --> 00:40:27.558]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[00:40:27.598 --> 00:40:30.379]  Like, Trump gets every, let me tell you, Trump gets things from Trump.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.361]  That statement he had the other day, he had written that.
[00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:34.842]  That's what Trump does.
[00:40:37.303 --> 00:40:40.124]  I'm not going to get into the specifics of it, but Trump does what he does.
[00:40:40.224 --> 00:40:42.244]  Oh, knife rampage in Finland.
[00:40:42.324 --> 00:40:42.984]  Six stabbed.
[00:40:43.264 --> 00:40:44.705]  Screaming Allah Akbar.
[00:40:45.145 --> 00:40:46.805]  Another stabbing attack in Germany.
[00:40:46.825 --> 00:40:50.226]  18-year-old jihadi behind Barcelona massacre.
[00:40:50.966 --> 00:40:55.567]  So that's all up on InfoWars.com and DrudgeReport.com.
[00:40:57.067 --> 00:41:00.248]  Newt is sounding the alarm saying president at risk.
[00:41:01.254 --> 00:41:03.718]  Well yeah, the Republican establishment is moving against him.
[00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:05.481]  They're trying to plunge the stock market.
[00:41:05.521 --> 00:41:07.604]  They don't want to get rid of Obamacare.
[00:41:10.643 --> 00:41:14.946]  They don't want to get rid of all the stuff they help bipartisanly bring in.
[00:41:15.166 --> 00:41:16.608]  And that's what's so dumb about the left.
[00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:20.230]  The Republican establishment is teamed up with the Democrats against Trump.
[00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:31.259]  The mainstream media, Hollywood, the big banks, the insurance companies, screwing everyone but you don't care because you think it's a simulated victory if the economy implodes and you keep Obamacare.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.342]  Because again, they live in a virtual reality.
[00:41:36.943 --> 00:41:42.550]  They walk up yesterday and say, they even had it on tape, they go, you say nothing was real at Charlotte, it was actors.
[00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:44.357]  And I never said that.
[00:41:44.397 --> 00:41:49.261]  I said they've been caught hiring actors, crisis actors, before to go stir up stuff.
[00:41:49.301 --> 00:41:56.468]  Little did I know they'd actually hired them for Charlottesville, official Craigslist, official websites, official companies that have been around for over a decade.
[00:41:57.028 --> 00:41:59.611]  Little did I know that even their fake news about me became true.
[00:41:59.831 --> 00:42:00.411]  They're so bad.
[00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:04.235]  No wonder they were so upset about the actor statement because it was on target.
[00:42:04.535 --> 00:42:08.739]  They wanted to hit it first to then say it was made up and get that fake news out first.
[00:42:10.509 --> 00:42:12.870]  I don't know everything up front, but I'll figure it out real, real quick.
[00:42:13.451 --> 00:42:14.771]  And look, we keep showing Zero Hedge.
[00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:15.912]  Let's actually show the website.
[00:42:16.312 --> 00:42:16.652]  There it is.
[00:42:16.952 --> 00:42:21.855]  Your Home for Protest Rallies, Audiences and PR Stunts and Celebrities.
[00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:24.516]  And I can't see the URL because of my time clock.
[00:42:24.796 --> 00:42:27.218]  I'm going to give folks the URL for radio listeners.
[00:42:27.238 --> 00:42:28.578]  It's not fair to radio listeners.
[00:42:28.598 --> 00:42:29.519]  I need to give them the URL.
[00:42:30.339 --> 00:42:32.240]  Let's go to the About Us and the name of the company.
[00:42:32.661 --> 00:42:36.703]  Celebrity Events, Who Welfare, Contact Us.
[00:42:36.743 --> 00:42:38.844]  Hell, we ought to call them live on air.
[00:42:40.205 --> 00:42:44.066]  Yeah, it's crowdsondemand.com.
[00:42:44.667 --> 00:42:45.147]  And there it is.
[00:42:45.227 --> 00:42:46.007]  Meet the team.
[00:42:46.147 --> 00:42:53.890]  Adam Seward, CEO, founded Crowds On Demand in October 2012 to revolutionize the people business.
[00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.630]  It's literal astroturf.
[00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.471]  They say, we are astroturf.
[00:42:58.308 --> 00:42:59.549]  Yeah, they filled Hillary rallies.
[00:42:59.569 --> 00:43:01.872]  They even did the fake Hillary rallies that were all actors.
[00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:02.973]  That was their people.
[00:43:03.974 --> 00:43:05.075]  So there's a bunch of other companies.
[00:43:05.936 --> 00:43:12.182]  But the point is, they say, we're going to Charlottesville, and we're hiring people to agitate.
[00:43:13.203 --> 00:43:16.226]  And then their people are there, and then I'm wrong.
[00:43:16.726 --> 00:43:18.688]  And then I just said we should investigate actors.
[00:43:18.728 --> 00:43:19.769]  There's been actors before.
[00:43:20.802 --> 00:43:37.427]  Sometimes it's crazy, I've been at Nazi rallies covering it, and you'll actually see guys that you later learn are FBI informants and Jewish leaders and Jewish community people dressed up as Nazis and like stuff I think they probably got from the back lot at, you know, Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[00:43:37.487 --> 00:43:39.728]  I mean, it's literal, like, Hollywood outfits.
[00:43:40.368 --> 00:43:42.769]  Brown shirt outfits that hadn't been around since like 1933.
[00:43:44.773 --> 00:43:51.556]  And you see this and it's just like, it's like you know a commercial for Pepsi, you know it's not a documentary.
[00:43:51.976 --> 00:43:59.019]  And you go to these events and it's like, dude, the Grand Dragon looks, you know, like he's Howard Stern.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.620]  And people say, well how does Howard Stern look?
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.701]  You know how Howard Stern looks!
[00:44:03.761 --> 00:44:04.942]  Grand Dragon looks like Howard Stern!
[00:44:06.328 --> 00:44:08.590]  I mean, and then it comes out the guys have fed, and it's all fake!
[00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:13.254]  And we've got the videos online, you can go research it for yourself, and you know, it's all come out.
[00:44:13.474 --> 00:44:16.016]  And I'm defending Israel, and I'm not against Jews in general.
[00:44:16.256 --> 00:44:35.832]  I'm against the leftist, whether they be black, white, Hispanic, Jewish, old, young, Christian, Muslim, that are staging attacks, and putting poop swastikas on the walls, and burning crosses in front yards, and burning black churches, and in 99 plus percent of the cases, literally, I can't think of cases where it's real, except for Charlottesville, because they got some real white supremacists to actually come out to the event.
[00:44:37.517 --> 00:44:39.178]  With Bannon out, this is big news.
[00:44:39.459 --> 00:44:41.340]  I've got a bunch of clips I've got to play here.
[00:44:41.861 --> 00:44:49.407]  Owen Schroer, you're going to be riding shotgun today with Roger Stone when he's about to come in and host the third and fourth hours with you.
[00:44:49.427 --> 00:44:51.368]  But you've got a whole other hour yourself coming up.
[00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:53.010]  I've got a ton of clips I've sworn to cover.
[00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.011]  I mean, what do you just make of this?
[00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:55.792]  This is getting crazy.
[00:44:56.112 --> 00:44:57.533]  There's so much breaking right now.
[00:44:57.913 --> 00:45:00.915]  Bannon out, and now they're saying the stock markets are going to return.
[00:45:01.015 --> 00:45:03.017]  So magically, that's how that works.
[00:45:03.037 --> 00:45:04.878]  You predicted that in the first five minutes.
[00:45:04.918 --> 00:45:05.638]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:05.678 --> 00:45:07.620]  You predicted that in the first five minutes.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.301]  This is what they do, though.
[00:45:09.381 --> 00:45:10.622]  And Alex, you've been saying it.
[00:45:11.022 --> 00:45:12.543]  Trump is on a suicide mission.
[00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:19.087]  If he's willing to let Bannon go, that just shows, again, he's going in completely alone into the swamp.
[00:45:19.467 --> 00:45:24.651]  And if they do, if Bannon is truly out, that only makes him more powerful, and I think
[00:45:25.191 --> 00:45:27.813]  That what you're going to see now is a turning of the guard.
[00:45:27.953 --> 00:45:31.056]  Oh, I'm going to be calling Bannon today.
[00:45:31.136 --> 00:45:34.679]  Yeah, so Steve Bannon becomes more powerful if he's ousted from the White House.
[00:45:35.019 --> 00:45:38.902]  And then that empowers, in my vision, and I think that...
[00:45:42.065 --> 00:45:48.452]  And then you will be noticing Hope Hicks and Stephen Miller start to have more influence on Trump.
[00:45:48.892 --> 00:45:56.520]  That's right, you thought you could take Bannon out and take out the Nationalists from the White House, but he had Hope Hicks and Stephen Miller in there the whole time.
[00:46:06.019 --> 00:46:06.960]  But guess what, Alex?
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.682]  They're telling us not to go to free speech marches.
[00:46:10.722 --> 00:46:12.363]  This is from CBS Boston.
[00:46:12.743 --> 00:46:14.064]  Stay away from the free speech march.
[00:46:14.084 --> 00:46:14.344]  I told you.
[00:46:14.364 --> 00:46:15.285]  I said that on Saturday.
[00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:18.747]  This will be about banning gatherings because the anti-fault will come out and attack you.
[00:46:18.787 --> 00:46:20.948]  That's why CNN and MSNBC have come out.
[00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:25.032]  And then look at what the ACLU is doing.
[00:46:25.172 --> 00:46:25.772]  The ACLU has been
[00:46:39.817 --> 00:46:40.958]  Oh, it's so liberal!
[00:46:41.018 --> 00:46:42.599]  Look at what they're doing for the illegals!
[00:46:42.619 --> 00:46:44.501]  Look at what they're doing for the open borders!
[00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:45.842]  Look at what they're doing for the sanctuary cities!
[00:46:45.882 --> 00:46:47.063]  We love the ACLU!
[00:46:47.303 --> 00:46:48.144]  They're so tolerant!
[00:46:48.164 --> 00:46:48.904]  They're so liberal!
[00:46:49.485 --> 00:46:54.629]  Oh, but it was the ACLU that was behind getting the white supremacist march to happen!
[00:46:55.069 --> 00:47:00.453]  So look at how the ACLU is playing off both sides and then trying to act like they have some sort of virtue over the rest of America.
[00:47:00.473 --> 00:47:01.835]  That's an embarrassment!
[00:47:02.675 --> 00:47:04.777]  We love our ACLU.
[00:47:04.797 --> 00:47:06.578]  We love the ACLU.
[00:47:06.898 --> 00:47:08.519]  They hate this country.
[00:47:08.539 --> 00:47:10.281]  They want to take it down.
[00:47:10.301 --> 00:47:12.322]  Pour your hot coffee on my face.
[00:47:12.782 --> 00:47:14.304]  Oh thank you, you're so liberal.
[00:47:14.864 --> 00:47:16.265]  Alex, I gotta ask you a serious question.
[00:47:16.285 --> 00:47:17.186]  Let's get serious for a second.
[00:47:17.626 --> 00:47:23.110]  When that guy reared back with his coffee thermos, how, I mean, you must have been really scared.
[00:47:25.592 --> 00:47:30.475]  You know, I am actually scared that I have, I don't have enough fear.
[00:47:30.595 --> 00:47:31.016]  And I really,
[00:47:32.205 --> 00:47:35.086]  I really shouldn't be going out there and doing this, but I just want to illustrate that.
[00:47:35.406 --> 00:47:37.666]  But you just can't believe they're going to attack you.
[00:47:38.086 --> 00:47:40.006]  And the first guy said F you and kind of ran off.
[00:47:40.086 --> 00:47:40.987]  I just wanted to interview him.
[00:47:41.247 --> 00:47:42.527]  I probably shouldn't have chased after that guy.
[00:47:42.747 --> 00:47:50.828]  But the other guy came up to us, started running his chest into me, and it was like just a big old, you know, little bucket of joy there.
[00:47:50.848 --> 00:47:52.249]  I almost squeezed him.
[00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:57.290]  He really thought that pulling his thermos back was like some sort of threat.
[00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:58.730]  Like you could have ran right through him.
[00:48:00.157 --> 00:48:01.538]  I don't know, he looked pretty tough to me.
[00:48:01.999 --> 00:48:02.739]  Well, look, Alex.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.022]  Yeah, you know, I've fought tougher men, but I can't remember when.
[00:48:06.042 --> 00:48:08.705]  He kicked me in the mule and he bit like a crocodile.
[00:48:08.745 --> 00:48:10.527]  Boy, we got some Johnny Cash on our minds today.
[00:48:10.547 --> 00:48:10.987]  I was listening to you.
[00:48:11.007 --> 00:48:15.911]  But there sitting at a table dealing stud was the evil one-eyed man that named me Sue.
[00:48:16.352 --> 00:48:18.474]  You know, Johnny Cash... I said, my name is Sue!
[00:48:18.954 --> 00:48:20.195]  How do you do?
[00:48:20.496 --> 00:48:21.497]  Now you're gonna die!
[00:48:24.178 --> 00:48:26.919]  Johnny Cash also sang a remake of Won't Back Down.
[00:48:26.979 --> 00:48:28.419]  I couldn't stop listening to that this morning.
[00:48:28.439 --> 00:48:29.819]  But Alex, here's the thing.
[00:48:29.839 --> 00:48:31.799]  So I won't back down.
[00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:33.720]  They want to erase our history.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:42.641]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't.
[00:48:42.961 --> 00:48:44.862]  We need to have Johnny Cash, Won't Back Down.
[00:48:46.602 --> 00:48:48.022]  I know that's actually in the computer.
[00:48:48.382 --> 00:48:49.043]  I know it's in there.
[00:48:49.063 --> 00:48:49.863]  I haven't heard it in years.
[00:48:52.719 --> 00:48:56.521]  It's not safe for us to go to these rallies anymore.
[00:48:56.541 --> 00:48:57.201]  Well, I'm gonna be honest.
[00:48:57.261 --> 00:48:58.522]  You think I'm pretty charged up.
[00:48:58.562 --> 00:49:02.864]  There's nothing more than I'd love about 15 of those guys just to line up fair and square like Popeye.
[00:49:03.285 --> 00:49:05.366]  Well, Alex, there's a Trump rally coming up.
[00:49:05.386 --> 00:49:06.746]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:49:06.966 --> 00:49:08.947]  Only problem is my hands will be broken pretty quick.
[00:49:09.028 --> 00:49:09.888]  There's a Trump rally.
[00:49:09.908 --> 00:49:11.249]  Hey, here's Johnny Cash, Alex.
[00:49:12.353 --> 00:49:12.533]  Yes.
[00:49:12.593 --> 00:49:15.254]  Very scary guy, though.
[00:49:15.294 --> 00:49:20.797]  Now he threatens you with a coffee thermos.
[00:49:20.817 --> 00:49:21.137]  I'll hit ya.
[00:49:21.257 --> 00:49:21.737]  Unbelievable.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:37.501]  No, I won't.
[00:49:37.581 --> 00:49:39.443]  But that's not, I mean, I don't want him back down.
[00:49:39.523 --> 00:49:41.625]  I want him to wake up out of his trance.
[00:49:42.206 --> 00:49:45.149]  Alex, here's what, here's an amazing thing that will happen.
[00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.852]  And this is, I've seen this happen in real time.
[00:49:48.193 --> 00:49:49.514]  You send me to Trump rallies.
[00:49:49.534 --> 00:49:50.876]  You've sent Millie to Trump rallies.
[00:49:50.896 --> 00:49:51.677]  We've recorded this.
[00:49:51.697 --> 00:49:52.558]  We've documented this.
[00:49:53.078 --> 00:49:59.060]  These protesters come after us, they're seething, they hate us, they scream at us, they throw things at us, they threaten us.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:10.102]  But then what happens is the actual reasonable people that are in the crowd, the actual people that still have a soul, still have a hope for humanity, see that and they don't want to be associated with that.
[00:50:10.162 --> 00:50:11.503]  They are turned off by that.
[00:50:11.763 --> 00:50:12.743]  They're confused by that.
[00:50:12.783 --> 00:50:14.603]  They say, wait a second, I'm not aligned with that.
[00:50:14.683 --> 00:50:16.324]  I'm not aligned with this crazy person.
[00:50:16.584 --> 00:50:17.624]  I'm not aligned with this nut.
[00:50:17.944 --> 00:50:20.845]  And it kind of opens their eyes for a second to realize what team they're on.
[00:50:21.025 --> 00:50:22.686]  And that's why we've got to keep engaging.
[00:50:22.746 --> 00:50:24.066]  It's why they don't want us to have free speech.
[00:50:24.086 --> 00:50:25.827]  It's why they told Trump to not have rallies.
[00:50:25.847 --> 00:50:28.808]  Skip this one break because I've got to go to all these clips since I mentioned it.
[00:50:28.828 --> 00:50:32.329]  Then I'm going to get out of here and I'll be back on Monday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:32.449 --> 00:50:33.850]  Owen and everybody are doing a great job.
[00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:40.872]  On Tuesday, or is it Monday, we launched the new show with David Knight, Real News with David Knight.
[00:50:41.192 --> 00:50:48.275]  And about a week later, we launched the War Room with a whole great crew of Mike Sternovich, Roger Stone, and yours truly,
[00:50:49.645 --> 00:50:51.686]  Before I go any further, let's just go ahead and get to this right now.
[00:50:51.806 --> 00:51:11.876]  Here is the sickening evil of Wolf Blitzer on CNN and MSNBC, the same talking point, as they wouldn't say it was Islamic terror, wouldn't even call it terror in any major publication that I've seen, New York Times, USA Today, they came out and they said that this might have been a copycat from Charlottesville, Virginia.
[00:51:11.976 --> 00:51:12.557]  Incredible.
[00:51:12.757 --> 00:51:19.100]  So they've covered up hundreds of these car attacks the last few years, two more stabbing attacks today, screaming, Allah Akbar!
[00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:23.163]  But you gotta really dig to even find that in the foreign press.
[00:51:23.183 --> 00:51:32.070]  But oh my gosh, one conservative rally with a few white supremacist ding-dings, moron idiots, and one psycho, and it's just like the end of the world, we're all guilty, we all deserve to die.
[00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:39.856]  Here they are, literally going over and beyond, bending over backwards to cover up their alliance with jihadist terrorists.
[00:51:40.396 --> 00:51:42.077]  Well, Alex, it's amazing.
[00:51:42.517 --> 00:52:01.207]  In light of the uproar of the last several days, five days apart you have white supremacists in Charlottesville use a vehicle to kill, and here you have attackers at least following the modus operandi of terrorists using vehicles apparently to kill as well.
[00:52:02.708 --> 00:52:05.730]  Those shared tactics, it should be alarming.
[00:52:06.454 --> 00:52:08.415]  Yeah, and there will be questions about copycats.
[00:52:08.435 --> 00:52:21.400]  There will be questions if what happened in Barcelona was at all, at all, a copycat version of what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, even though there may be different characters, different political ambitions.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:30.503]  They use the same killing device, a vehicle going at high speed into a group, a large group of pedestrians.
[00:52:30.863 --> 00:52:33.744]  And as the local police are saying, at least one person is now dead.
[00:52:33.804 --> 00:52:34.205]  Here's MSNBC.
[00:52:36.331 --> 00:52:38.173]  No, it's just 15 dead, but they were covering that up.
[00:52:38.213 --> 00:52:38.874]  Here's MSNBC.
[00:52:38.914 --> 00:52:40.916]  I have to put this into context.
[00:52:41.956 --> 00:52:48.843]  The attack in Charlottesville that we saw was just an American version of this same style of attack.
[00:52:49.383 --> 00:52:56.850]  And interestingly enough, with the intensity of information that we've had related to the Charlottesville incident over the last five days,
[00:52:57.973 --> 00:53:07.634]  It's quite possible that may have precipitated this terrorist group's desire to gain the limelight and carry out a similar attack.
[00:53:09.255 --> 00:53:10.495]  A similar attack.
[00:53:10.535 --> 00:53:14.236]  I could talk with a fake, but very condescending, stuck-up voice.
[00:53:14.636 --> 00:53:30.740]  Like, how about the mainstream media works with radical Islam and the Ford Foundation and the UN and Peter Sutherland and a real Nazi collaborator, George Soros, to basically bring down our society and make us give up our liberties to be compatible with authoritarian political Islam.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.540]  How about that, Lester Holt?
[00:53:33.473 --> 00:53:36.874]  Alex Jones has no proof that there were actors in Charlottesville.
[00:53:36.974 --> 00:53:39.475]  Alex Jones has no proof that there are gay frogs.
[00:53:39.555 --> 00:53:44.296]  I've actually had people come up to me and go, you say Charlottesville didn't happen.
[00:53:44.316 --> 00:53:45.837]  And I never even said that.
[00:53:45.977 --> 00:53:47.497]  I said they've had actors before.
[00:53:47.837 --> 00:53:48.638]  We should look into it.
[00:53:48.678 --> 00:53:55.860]  And we have the very Craigslist and the very company that Hillary almost exclusively hires, like you were pointing out.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:11.774]  Will you do a whole focus report on that maybe that we can air just over and over again the next week that actually shows the company doing Hillary's ads, shows them advertising, shows them saying we want agitators, just to say, yes, the Democrats hired actors to go out and agitate.
[00:54:12.575 --> 00:54:14.697]  But all I said is, we should look into it!
[00:54:14.717 --> 00:54:15.998]  Because they've always do it!
[00:54:16.058 --> 00:54:16.639]  And they did!
[00:54:16.719 --> 00:54:17.339]  We were right!
[00:54:17.439 --> 00:54:18.020]  We were right!
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:18.700]  We were right!
[00:54:18.881 --> 00:54:20.522]  But PolitiFact scared Zee!
[00:54:20.882 --> 00:54:23.405]  They're PolitiFacts on the mountain!
[00:54:23.705 --> 00:54:24.886]  PolitiFacts did!
[00:54:25.246 --> 00:54:26.908]  Now, let's move on here to MSNBC and CNN.
[00:54:28.769 --> 00:54:49.823]  Respectively, promoting and legitimizing violence, because after all, anyone they say is a Nazi is a Nazi now, and so you get hot coffee poured in your face, or you get shot, or like, you know, Republican legislators and Republican congressmen and Republican city councilmen in the last couple months in their yards, neighbor walks over, double caps you, it's like, hey, you deserve to die!
[00:54:50.164 --> 00:54:54.647]  CNN's Walt Blitzer said to ask people on, saying, oh, Congressman Scalise got shot because folks are pissed!
[00:54:55.327 --> 00:54:56.228]  No, cops get shot?
[00:54:56.268 --> 00:54:57.890]  Well, you know, cops are bad.
[00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.891]  Black lives matter.
[00:54:58.911 --> 00:55:01.013]  You're going to keep dying until you lick our butts?
[00:55:01.314 --> 00:55:02.936]  Excuse me, I'm Wolf Blitzer reporting.
[00:55:03.316 --> 00:55:05.699]  So that's what these people are like.
[00:55:05.759 --> 00:55:07.781]  They're scum and they're not bullying us.
[00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:08.662]  They're cowards.
[00:55:08.922 --> 00:55:11.065]  So they think all their bullying has an effect on us.
[00:55:11.405 --> 00:55:14.188]  Our problem is we don't have any fear of you people.
[00:55:14.208 --> 00:55:15.449]  We have to have better governors.
[00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:17.910]  Let's go ahead and go to MSNBC and CNN.
[00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:20.551]  Legitimizing the violence of the fascist Antifa.
[00:55:44.582 --> 00:55:49.063]  Ladies and gentlemen, the arrogance of the... It's no big deal.
[00:55:49.183 --> 00:55:50.023]  We had the clip yesterday.
[00:55:50.043 --> 00:55:50.583]  I didn't get to it.
[00:55:50.623 --> 00:55:51.564]  I checked before the show.
[00:55:51.584 --> 00:55:52.564]  I was told we had the clips.
[00:55:53.104 --> 00:55:53.704]  That's okay.
[00:55:54.164 --> 00:55:54.744]  Do we have those?
[00:55:54.764 --> 00:55:55.325]  Just let me know.
[00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:55.845]  No big deal.
[00:55:55.865 --> 00:55:56.425]  I'm on the road.
[00:55:56.925 --> 00:55:58.105]  Do we have the clips of that or not?
[00:56:00.106 --> 00:56:09.608]  In light of the uproar of the last several days, five days apart, you have white supremacists in Charlottesville... Let's cut it off there.
[00:56:10.731 --> 00:56:12.432]  Let's pull out of this while we still can.
[00:56:13.332 --> 00:56:14.592]  We'll go to break in a few minutes.
[00:56:14.913 --> 00:56:21.975]  There was two clips in my video list yesterday of MSNBC and CNN legitimize antifa violence.
[00:56:22.235 --> 00:56:23.316]  They condone the violence.
[00:56:23.716 --> 00:56:24.336]  Those are the clips.
[00:56:24.356 --> 00:56:26.917]  We're not talking about Barcelona and the jihadi attacks.
[00:56:26.977 --> 00:56:27.517]  It's fine.
[00:56:27.537 --> 00:56:27.917]  I don't need it.
[00:56:27.937 --> 00:56:28.518]  Let's just move on.
[00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:29.798]  Let's just move on now.
[00:56:30.098 --> 00:56:31.039]  Two times is too much.
[00:56:31.399 --> 00:56:31.839]  No big deal.
[00:56:32.179 --> 00:56:34.260]  Okay, let's go to Al Sharpton.
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:37.081]  I'm going to go to Al Sharpton now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:39.602]  As Donald Trump told you, Al Sharpton
[00:56:40.663 --> 00:56:44.305]  Came out and said, yeah, let's go ahead and ban Thomas Jefferson.
[00:56:44.686 --> 00:56:47.868]  Now remember, Trump said they're going to want to ban that next because they're already calling for it.
[00:56:48.468 --> 00:56:51.270]  This is the guy that put in the first declaration to free the slaves.
[00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:57.394]  Yes, he had slaves because that was in his family, but he basically freed them before the law even said he could.
[00:56:57.974 --> 00:57:01.356]  And people say, well, yeah, he shouldn't have sex and basically married one of them.
[00:57:01.636 --> 00:57:02.017]  Whatever.
[00:57:02.057 --> 00:57:02.777]  This is insane.
[00:57:03.197 --> 00:57:04.879]  So in his time, he tried to get rid of it.
[00:57:04.939 --> 00:57:05.899]  So he's the bad guy.
[00:57:06.119 --> 00:57:07.280]  Get rid of his statue, too.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.821]  This is the mass mental illness.
[00:57:09.041 --> 00:57:10.042]  Here is Al Sharpton.
[00:57:11.181 --> 00:57:12.181]  He mentioned Thomas Jefferson.
[00:57:12.201 --> 00:57:14.242]  He wrote a biography of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:57:14.262 --> 00:57:15.462]  Thomas Jefferson had slaves.
[00:57:15.602 --> 00:57:16.402]  Yeah, I've read it.
[00:57:16.422 --> 00:57:19.423]  He had slaves and children with the slaves.
[00:57:19.503 --> 00:57:19.903]  Exactly.
[00:57:20.143 --> 00:57:20.883]  And it does matter.
[00:57:20.903 --> 00:57:23.704]  So the air shows here, they take down the Jefferson Memorial?
[00:57:23.724 --> 00:57:35.426]  I think that people need to understand when people that were enslaved and robbed of even the right to marry and had forced sex.
[00:57:36.226 --> 00:57:36.626]  That's enough!
[00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:06.130]  Certainly it ought to be removed.
[00:58:06.311 --> 00:58:09.132]  So that means the American flag, it means the Washington Monument.
[00:58:09.772 --> 00:58:14.654]  They're banning the word lynch off of dormitories and buildings, an Irish name because it scares people.
[00:58:15.074 --> 00:58:20.816]  They're taking masculine images of men down at the football field houses because it scares people.
[00:58:21.656 --> 00:58:25.938]  The globalists just want to turn the public into a bunch of ninnies that are scared of anything and everything.
[00:58:26.738 --> 00:58:31.363]  Don't forget, big specials are going to have to end on Monday or Tuesday because we're selling out a lot of products.

[00:59:08.366 --> 00:59:20.471]  The BuzzFeed group promoting this said the best final of the B12 is $35 and that we're bad for selling it for $17.76, when ours is private-labeled by the very group they chose to say, here's the best, and here's Alex's.
[00:59:20.591 --> 00:59:22.632]  I mean, that's just providence that that happened.
[00:59:23.292 --> 00:59:25.234]  So BuzzFeed just says we are the best, the cleanest.
[00:59:25.574 --> 00:59:26.495]  We're just absolutely.
[00:59:26.835 --> 00:59:28.736]  And then they're just frothing, don't even know what to do.
[00:59:29.157 --> 00:59:30.117]  So please support us.
[00:59:30.217 --> 00:59:31.078]  As you know, there's a war.
[00:59:31.098 --> 00:59:32.319]  We're trying to shut everybody down.
[00:59:32.359 --> 00:59:33.159]  Please pray for us.

[00:59:38.643 --> 00:59:42.126]  Got the Super Blue Fluoride Free with the Colloidal Silver and Iodine Toothpaste Pack.
[00:59:42.446 --> 00:59:46.169]  And the Children's Inn as well as the new Super Blue Mouthwash that is amazing.

[00:59:52.653 --> 00:59:53.674]  Just make the commitment!
[00:59:55.755 --> 00:59:59.858]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:00:00.378 --> 01:00:01.659]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.181]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:00:20.681 --> 01:00:24.623]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:31.465 --> 01:00:32.405]  So, we've got
[01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:38.211]  Cambrius with more car attacks and four jihadis killed last night.
[01:00:38.772 --> 01:00:49.298]  We have massive knife attacks all over Europe, in France, in Germany, in other areas, screaming Allah Akbar.
[01:00:49.799 --> 01:00:51.240]  We've got Stephen Bannon out.
[01:00:52.278 --> 01:00:52.618]  We're good to go.
[01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:18.053]  Uh, where they are legitimizing anti-fuss violence against the right.
[01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:24.715]  Or against white supremacists, they call anybody that doesn't present their five-year-old to the local pedophile to be raped.
[01:01:25.455 --> 01:01:30.577]  Uh, literally, if you don't let an ambler come to your front door and go, here to take your six-year-old out, you are now a Nazi.
[01:01:31.077 --> 01:01:34.479]  Not being a Nazi means turning yourself over to every pedophile heroine head.
[01:01:34.679 --> 01:01:35.459]  That's what it means.
[01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:37.680]  And being a total loser, devil worshiper.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.141]  Uh, so let's go ahead and play those clips, here it is.
[01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:47.328]  Mark Bray, you are writing this book, Antifa, the anti-fascist handbook.
[01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:51.992]  Explain this movement and its roots.
[01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:53.813]  Right, right.
[01:01:53.853 --> 01:02:02.118]  So, anti-fascism goes back to the beginning of the 20th century when leftists of all stripes fought back against Mussolini and Hitler.
[01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:15.708]  Most people think of Nazism as something that died in World War II, but it really rebranded itself, grew again in a lot of European countries, in the United States, and so the modern Antifa movement grows out of the 70s and 80s.
[01:02:16.828 --> 01:02:17.809]  A Nazi collaborator.
[01:02:17.909 --> 01:02:27.955]  ...in Germany, when a lot of immigrants, when a lot of leftists, punk rockers, had to physically defend themselves from neo-Nazi attacks.
[01:02:28.236 --> 01:02:30.497]  And that's where we can trace this lineage from today.
[01:02:30.817 --> 01:02:38.482]  The main perspective of Antifa is essentially that rather than simply waiting for the threat to materialize, you stop it from the beginning.
[01:02:38.782 --> 01:02:43.265]  You say no platform for fascism, and that's what we're seeing with the attempts in Charlottesville and elsewhere.
[01:02:43.285 --> 01:02:45.867]  You ban free speech, and you go out and attack people.
[01:02:46.147 --> 01:02:50.210]  Are you an advocate of this sort of confrontation?
[01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:52.692]  Yes, I am, yes.
[01:02:53.252 --> 01:03:01.878]  What do you say to those that are concerned that, hey, you're allowing these white supremacists to claim victimhood here?
[01:03:03.019 --> 01:03:09.043]  What do you say to that criticism, since the president is trying to essentially create a false equivalency here?
[01:03:10.515 --> 01:03:11.756]  Well, I think there's two parts of it.
[01:03:11.976 --> 01:03:15.699]  One is, how do far-right movements grow?
[01:03:16.219 --> 01:03:24.144]  I say they grow by becoming normalized, by not being confronted, by being able to present themselves as family-friendly and respectable.
[01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:26.266]  I mean, this is just fascinating.
[01:03:26.286 --> 01:03:28.087]  We should do a whole show just on these tapes.
[01:03:29.088 --> 01:03:36.753]  Because, I mean, again, they're saying they're going to ban people's free speech, they're going to call you Nazis and dehumanize you, which is a classic Nazi tactic.
[01:03:37.671 --> 01:03:38.992]  Then they're funded by George Soros.
[01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:40.293]  He's the main funder of Antifa.
[01:03:40.393 --> 01:03:41.353]  They are fascist.
[01:03:41.914 --> 01:03:42.714]  Their roots are in that.
[01:03:42.734 --> 01:03:45.596]  We had a historian on just two days ago breaking that down.
[01:03:46.597 --> 01:03:48.038]  And then they're not going to give you a platform.
[01:03:48.238 --> 01:03:50.640]  They're going to ban your speech and then they're going to physically assault you.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:58.285]  But it's okay because they talk in little voices like this when they hit a woman in the head with a bike lock or, you know, beat up some lesbian woman trying to go hear somebody speak.
[01:03:58.525 --> 01:04:00.146]  Because, you know, you're not allowed to go hear somebody speak.
[01:04:00.506 --> 01:04:01.987]  We're going to hit you in the head with a bike lock, okay?
[01:04:02.367 --> 01:04:04.168]  You don't go to meetings unless we say so.
[01:04:04.409 --> 01:04:05.289]  We run things now.
[01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:06.170]  We run your kids.
[01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:11.135]  Let's hear for the rest from the man that's going to tell us how to think.
[01:04:11.796 --> 01:04:12.497]  Thank God for him.
[01:04:21.345 --> 01:04:23.707]  Total Bull, these people are all about semantical deception.
[01:04:23.948 --> 01:04:24.769]  They control reality.
[01:04:24.809 --> 01:04:34.499]  Remember, they create the term alt-right, they project it on everybody that's against Hillary, then they have their own white supremacist groups clearly led by leftist groups, by people that were just working for Obama two years ago.
[01:04:34.519 --> 01:04:35.239]  Okay?
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.260]  That's how dumb I think we are.
[01:04:36.881 --> 01:04:38.262]  And work for Antifa.
[01:04:38.603 --> 01:04:40.204]  Now Antifa leads the event.
[01:04:40.825 --> 01:04:51.214]  Gets their permit, goes out, the event happens, and then now they've got to ban our free speech or the little batmen are going to come out of their little caves and bike lock us and coffee us.
[01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:56.358]  Maybe they'll join their Islamic brethren and start acid attacking people that don't get in line.
[01:04:56.679 --> 01:04:58.600]  Maybe that's the next liberal thing.
[01:04:58.901 --> 01:05:00.722]  Because after all, they're the saviors.
[01:05:01.122 --> 01:05:02.524]  Oh, they're the little heroin heads.
[01:05:04.031 --> 01:05:08.934]  I told you that last month's specials were the biggest we've ever had with the largest number of products.
[01:05:09.434 --> 01:05:17.779]  And I'm just getting more and more into sales because folks love it and you respond so well that we're able to still operate and fund ourselves and lower prices.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.341]  And we are calling it now the BuzzFeed special.
[01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:24.343]  It's last month's specials and the 1776 specials of this month.
[01:05:27.426 --> 01:05:33.012]  Hands down the biggest specials we have ever offered in my 22 years on air.
[01:05:33.613 --> 01:05:42.763]  The BuzzFeed special is last month's and this month's specials all together at once and many items have free shipping.
[01:05:43.223 --> 01:05:45.566]  All items have free shipping on orders of $50 or more.
[01:05:46.747 --> 01:05:49.289]  Brain Force Plus, 55% off.
[01:05:49.629 --> 01:05:52.931]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen, especially with all this nuclear war talk.
[01:05:53.232 --> 01:05:53.832]  Everybody should have it.
[01:05:53.852 --> 01:05:55.113]  This is the purest form of iodine.
[01:05:55.533 --> 01:06:06.101]  Secret 12, a super high quality iodine that BuzzFeed's analysis said we sell for $12 less than the leading brand that it's private labeled of, and that we have the very best deal in the world.
[01:06:06.461 --> 01:06:13.566]  BuzzFeed tried to attack us and said, totally clean California standards, and we sell the number one B12 in the world.
[01:06:16.024 --> 01:06:18.445]  Their analysis had to admit, okay, it's true.
[01:06:23.649 --> 01:06:24.169]  Excuse me.
[01:06:24.509 --> 01:06:25.249]  It's hilarious.
[01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:28.351]  They didn't know that part until they said, this is the best B-12 example, $35.
[01:06:28.591 --> 01:06:33.294]  Theirs is just pure B-12, totally clean, but it should be, you know, a lot less.
[01:06:33.374 --> 01:06:37.677]  When ours was $17.76 and theirs was $35, the exact same one branded, labeled by us.
[01:06:38.017 --> 01:06:39.358]  Oh boy, that's delicious.
[01:06:39.718 --> 01:06:41.019]  The irony of that is incredible.
[01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:44.761]  BioTruth Selenium, 29% off, $17.76.

[01:06:59.290 --> 01:06:59.791]  Amazing.
[01:07:00.231 --> 01:07:01.592]  It is discounted right now.
[01:07:01.972 --> 01:07:03.853]  Silver Bullet, 66% off.

[01:07:16.337 --> 01:07:16.817]  Boom!

[01:07:20.818 --> 01:07:22.199]  DNA Force, 20% off.
[01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:23.479]  And there's even more.
[01:07:23.499 --> 01:07:25.100]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:07:26.596 --> 01:07:28.377]  You need these high-quality products.
[01:07:28.397 --> 01:07:29.057]  They're amazing.
[01:07:29.077 --> 01:07:31.558]  You need these high-quality air filtration systems in your house.
[01:07:31.618 --> 01:07:33.158]  You need to be purifying your water.
[01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:34.519]  We've got the best gravity-fed systems.
[01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:40.521]  We've got the children's fluoride-free toothpaste back in super blue with colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:07:40.881 --> 01:07:41.661]  It's all there.
[01:07:41.781 --> 01:07:42.962]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:07:43.002 --> 01:07:49.644]  And when you fund us, it rubs the globalists in the ground, and they hate it, and they can't stand it, and they don't know what to do about it.
[01:07:49.964 --> 01:07:53.888]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:58.133]  And this is the biggest sale we've ever had.
[01:07:58.173 --> 01:07:59.855]  I keep saying this is a big one, this is a big one.
[01:08:00.135 --> 01:08:03.579]  This is the biggest because I can bind two and I love to make fun of BuzzFeed.
[01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:17.653]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:08:18.393 --> 01:08:23.017]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.477 --> 01:08:28.661]  Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Bannon is out at the Lighthouse, reportedly going back to Breitbart.
[01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:33.425]  He told me he would not give any interviews as long as he's at the White House, but I've got his personal number.
[01:08:34.065 --> 01:08:36.728]  And so look for him to be on the show hopefully next week.
[01:08:36.748 --> 01:08:37.628]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:42.773]  Again, we're not in competition with Breitbart, Daily Caller, Gerald Celente, anybody.
[01:08:42.813 --> 01:08:46.376]  We're all in this together.
[01:08:46.436 --> 01:08:48.077]  Mark Dice's strength is our strength.
[01:08:48.418 --> 01:08:49.959]  Paul Watson's strength is our strength.
[01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:51.961]  Matt Drudge's strength is our strength.
[01:08:53.203 --> 01:08:54.964]  Gerald Cilente is, again, our strength.
[01:08:55.004 --> 01:09:04.311]  We are all, not conservatives or liberals, but quite frankly, true intellectuals, super-informed, super-hyper-aware, super-news-houndy.
[01:09:05.392 --> 01:09:11.156]  Just like I said on Live Feed Saturday last week, I said, look, look for actors being there.
[01:09:11.676 --> 01:09:14.558]  Usually the KKK and white supremacists are wound up by groups.
[01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:17.460]  I said, it's turned out even the FBI has been leading it.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.083]  They even had Jewish people faking as KKK.
[01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:22.324]  I mean, that's been in the news.
[01:09:22.904 --> 01:09:25.466]  Then they turned it around and I said, Jews staged Charlottesville.
[01:09:25.846 --> 01:09:28.508]  But everybody knows I'm the opposite of a racist or anti-Semite.
[01:09:28.888 --> 01:09:34.492]  I'm not anti-Israel, I'm not anti... Everybody knows that I'm against radical Islam.
[01:09:34.852 --> 01:09:38.254]  But they got to turn it around and say Jones says Jews did Charlottesville.
[01:09:38.835 --> 01:09:41.456]  And then PolitiFact says Jones is wrong about actors being there.
[01:09:41.476 --> 01:09:42.557]  I didn't even say that!
[01:09:42.937 --> 01:09:49.522]  But now there was Craigslist ads and major Democrat Party organizations that admit they hired actors to be there.
[01:09:50.262 --> 01:09:51.643]  They said, we're at Charlottesville.
[01:09:51.823 --> 01:09:53.104]  We're going to go agitate.
[01:09:53.204 --> 01:09:54.885]  We work for the Democratic Party.
[01:09:55.366 --> 01:09:56.667]  It was in other people's news.
[01:09:57.587 --> 01:10:03.571]  I mean, I just instinctively tell you what's going on because the globalists do the same thing over and over again.
[01:10:03.952 --> 01:10:07.254]  I said, I don't know what's happening with this, but we should investigate it.
[01:10:08.315 --> 01:10:13.358]  I was saying that as it was happening, one hour later, Trump comes out and says we should investigate.
[01:10:13.639 --> 01:10:14.859]  He didn't get that from me.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.521]  He's a smart guy.
[01:10:16.841 --> 01:10:18.082]  He knows this stuff's going on.
[01:10:19.589 --> 01:10:26.791]  They plunged the stock market yesterday openly in an attempt to intimidate Trump and make him get rid of Bannon.
[01:10:26.811 --> 01:10:30.852]  They said, get rid of Bannon and do this stuff and we'll let it go back up.
[01:10:31.392 --> 01:10:35.072]  Because it's naturally going up because of exuberance, but they're artificially killing it.
[01:10:35.133 --> 01:10:41.254]  And Trump is obsessed with getting blue collar jobs boosted, white collar jobs boosted.
[01:10:42.188 --> 01:11:00.562]  And with getting factories into black areas, I mean, if you want to say it's affirmative action, in the phone calls I've talked to the CEOs, it's come out, Trump is like, we'll get you the tax incentives, we'll get you the tax breaks, we'll get you the deals, we'll make, we'll shut down the Chinese stuff, can you put it in the middle of this black area and put in jobs programs for entry level?
[01:11:02.199 --> 01:11:05.383]  And they go, yes, sir, but we've got to put the ads out for everybody.
[01:11:05.423 --> 01:11:06.164]  And Trump says no.
[01:11:06.784 --> 01:11:10.288]  And I mean, behind the scenes, he's directing people to hire black folks.
[01:11:10.348 --> 01:11:14.133]  I mean, he just is obsessed with delivering to black people.
[01:11:14.773 --> 01:11:19.939]  And that's what makes me so angry to see them coming after him like this, because he's so good, folks.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.302]  And I'm not sitting on fences like other people.
[01:11:23.263 --> 01:11:24.223]  Killed the TPP.
[01:11:24.283 --> 01:11:25.584]  Killed all this globalist stuff.
[01:11:25.924 --> 01:11:27.045]  Killed the carbon tax.
[01:11:27.445 --> 01:11:29.446]  Secured the borders from felons.
[01:11:30.206 --> 01:11:31.706]  Got $4 trillion in the stock market.
[01:11:31.906 --> 01:11:32.867]  $400 billion in new jobs.
[01:11:33.087 --> 01:11:34.247]  $1.6 billion in new jobs.
[01:11:34.588 --> 01:11:36.028]  And they're saying he didn't do anything.
[01:11:36.088 --> 01:11:37.509]  He did incredible things.
[01:11:38.049 --> 01:11:40.230]  With renaissance and quality.
[01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:41.971]  Having respect for ourselves again.
[01:11:42.111 --> 01:11:43.751]  Everything Celente talks about.
[01:11:43.771 --> 01:11:45.472]  So Celente's taking over with Owen Schroer.
[01:11:45.492 --> 01:11:50.234]  I got hot coffee dumped on me out of a thermos by a thug that attacked me earlier.
[01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:53.886]  I mean, look, I've never seen such vicious leftists as Seattle.
[01:11:54.706 --> 01:11:55.626]  70% of the folks are nice.
[01:11:55.666 --> 01:11:56.247]  They're listeners.
[01:11:56.727 --> 01:11:57.987]  Almost everybody knows who I am.
[01:11:59.108 --> 01:12:01.328]  The Asians who are Americans love me.
[01:12:01.448 --> 01:12:03.009]  So many Japanese folks running over.
[01:12:04.329 --> 01:12:05.030]  They love Trump.
[01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.950]  Chinese love Trump.
[01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:10.072]  Uh, just Hispanics and stuff, but it's mainly white males.
[01:12:10.733 --> 01:12:13.735]  Kind of grunge, kind of, you know, drug scene type folks.
[01:12:13.755 --> 01:12:16.456]  I'm not saying they're into drugs, but they just look like drug scene types.
[01:12:16.897 --> 01:12:18.258]  You know, wannabe punk rock stuff.
[01:12:19.238 --> 01:12:22.640]  Uh, and, uh, Newsflash, punk rock was cool 40 years ago.
[01:12:23.721 --> 01:12:25.722]  You know, when Glenn Dadzik was doing the Misfits.
[01:12:26.683 --> 01:12:28.264]  My view, greatest punk band ever.
[01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.525]  Total genius, but, you know, moved on from that.
[01:12:31.266 --> 01:12:33.307]  And, uh, these people are just anti-free speech.
[01:12:33.327 --> 01:12:34.628]  They're covering up for the jihadis.
[01:12:35.108 --> 01:12:35.709]  It's amazing.
[01:12:37.079 --> 01:12:44.722]  Now before I go any further, there's so many articles on Infowars.com and turn this over.
[01:12:45.162 --> 01:12:46.863]  I plugged for 30 seconds last hour.
[01:12:47.584 --> 01:12:48.304]  I skipped a break.
[01:12:48.344 --> 01:12:49.244]  I've got to stop doing it.
[01:12:49.464 --> 01:12:51.865]  And we're putting in a new radio clock in about a month and a half.
[01:12:52.145 --> 01:12:53.086]  That's the standard clock.
[01:12:54.146 --> 01:12:55.727]  We're coming at 6 after, not 8 after.
[01:12:56.087 --> 01:13:00.569]  And I won't skip breaks anymore unless there's like a major war launches and then all the news does that.
[01:13:00.969 --> 01:13:02.490]  Stations will actually leave you if you don't.
[01:13:04.107 --> 01:13:07.275]  But I do lose myself and, you know, others thousands of dollars a day in funding.
[01:13:07.335 --> 01:13:08.579]  I just don't want to stop.
[01:13:09.742 --> 01:13:12.469]  But we need you to buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:14.957]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:13:14.977 --> 01:13:15.837]  They're trying to boycott us.
[01:13:15.857 --> 01:13:16.998]  They kicked us off Google Ads.
[01:13:17.398 --> 01:13:18.899]  That was about a $5 million ding.
[01:13:19.399 --> 01:13:21.560]  And that was basically all the extra money we had projected for 2017.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:26.303]  We've got most of that back now, because they're really aggressively plugging in sales.
[01:13:26.343 --> 01:13:27.764]  But then I tend to quit plugging.
[01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:29.185]  We've got our biggest sales ever.
[01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:33.007]  I keep saying biggest sales ever, because I just keep expanding them, because folks really respond.
[01:13:33.387 --> 01:13:35.648]  We have 66% off on some products.
[01:13:36.389 --> 01:13:37.550]  55 is the average.
[01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:38.550]  Is the average.
[01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:40.591]  We have Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:13:40.671 --> 01:13:41.872]  It ends this weekend.
[01:13:41.912 --> 01:13:42.693]  They told me I have to.
[01:13:44.434 --> 01:13:45.675]  $400 rival to the same system.
[01:13:45.715 --> 01:13:49.259]  Four filter system, ion filter, carbon filter, and a bunch of other systems.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.140]  It's $149.
[01:13:50.701 --> 01:13:52.743]  At $119, it's a steal.
[01:13:53.223 --> 01:13:55.646]  At $149, it's ridiculous loss leader.
[01:13:56.006 --> 01:13:57.808]  Water filtration system is the very best.
[01:13:58.149 --> 01:14:01.372]  Brain Force, Survival Shield, Secret 12, Oil of Oregano.
[01:14:02.455 --> 01:14:03.035]  We're good to go.
[01:14:20.426 --> 01:14:49.806]  Just take the power of your chicken noodle soup to infinity super concentrated bone broth with all the trace elements all the Stem cells all of it with the chaga with the turmeric with the bee pollen and more Amazing in chocolate and strawberry naturally flavored a little bit of stevia 50% off all the silver products unless you're talking about the actual silver bullet It's 66% off in full war store.com in full wars life calm our triple a two five three three one three nine, but I want to salute
[01:14:51.968 --> 01:14:56.813]  I want to salute our crew, you the listeners, all of us, because this isn't about giving out credit.
[01:14:57.414 --> 01:15:02.839]  I love the people that are awake, that know what's happening, and that enrich our lives.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.402]  And we're not liberal, we're not conservative.
[01:15:05.782 --> 01:15:09.726]  We're patriots, we're populist, and we understand America's under attack.
[01:15:10.347 --> 01:15:11.528]  From Brexit to the U.S.
[01:15:11.648 --> 01:15:13.348]  We're trying to get out from under globalism.
[01:15:13.488 --> 01:15:14.649]  Unelected world government.
[01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:16.030]  Corporate fascism.
[01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:17.530]  It controls the left and right.
[01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:20.472]  And the whole system's ganged up against the President right now.
[01:15:20.912 --> 01:15:22.152]  How could anybody not see it?
[01:15:22.292 --> 01:15:23.733]  I can't believe he's gone this far.
[01:15:24.093 --> 01:15:25.154]  He's totally committed.
[01:15:25.414 --> 01:15:26.915]  But they're trying to bring him down right now.
[01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:28.515]  They're openly saying they're getting ready to kill him.
[01:15:28.916 --> 01:15:30.236]  I'm going to turn it over to Gerald Cilente.
[01:15:30.256 --> 01:15:35.859]  But first off, Gerald, what do you make of Phil Mudd saying they're going to kill him a week and a half ago on CNN?
[01:15:36.119 --> 01:15:38.240]  Former CIA Deputy Director and Black Ops.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:39.861]  I don't think so.
[01:16:01.516 --> 01:16:01.736]  Hey, hey!
[01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:31.511]  Nothing has ever been like this in my lifetime or probably the lifetime of anybody living what they've done to this country.
[01:16:32.571 --> 01:16:37.914]  Every presidential election, there's always been, you know, the fighting up until election day.
[01:16:37.934 --> 01:16:47.400]  And then whoever gets elected, the media comes out and say, well, you know, you might not like who got elected, but we're Americans and we have to work together.
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:49.641]  They didn't do that this time.
[01:16:50.575 --> 01:16:54.136]  It's the media that's dividing the United States.
[01:16:55.257 --> 01:17:06.081]  And one of the things that Trump did, and he made it really clear, is he exposed the fake news that we're getting from the mainstream media.
[01:17:06.862 --> 01:17:08.562]  He should be applauded for that.
[01:17:09.163 --> 01:17:10.683]  Yet people still buy it.
[01:17:11.644 --> 01:17:16.926]  It's the media that is dividing this country.
[01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:20.167]  They never stop from Election Day.
[01:17:21.511 --> 01:17:28.419]  You look at USA Today, the headline story that ran right after Trump was elected.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.186]  President going into office with, what, 74 lawsuits or something like that.
[01:17:34.767 --> 01:17:36.889]  The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming.
[01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:38.752]  Not one shred of evidence.
[01:17:39.511 --> 01:17:42.434]  That they hacked into the DNC, not one shred.
[01:17:42.854 --> 01:17:46.457]  And now Assange is saying that, no, they didn't get it from the Russians.
[01:17:46.497 --> 01:17:47.478]  He said that before.
[01:17:47.498 --> 01:17:48.719]  He's repeating it.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.743]  But yet they've also had us learn how to hate the Russians.
[01:17:53.364 --> 01:18:01.671]  It is the media that's behind the destruction of this country, just as they're doing now with Charlottesville.
[01:18:02.131 --> 01:18:04.133]  They didn't have to cover this thing at this length.
[01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:05.995]  It could have came and gone.
[01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:09.122]  You know what happened up here in Kingston, New York?
[01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:12.063]  I'm at the most historic four corners in America.
[01:18:12.884 --> 01:18:17.086]  The only place where there's a pre-Revolutionary War stone building on each corner.
[01:18:18.086 --> 01:18:21.948]  Trump haters have defaced the entire area.
[01:18:22.508 --> 01:18:25.349]  The blue stone sidewalks in front of one of my buildings.
[01:18:25.749 --> 01:18:29.291]  A carriage step in front of the Dr. Janssen house.
[01:18:29.311 --> 01:18:33.353]  This is circa 1700s, this building.
[01:18:34.273 --> 01:18:36.254]  All this graffiti anti-Trump.
[01:18:36.829 --> 01:18:51.376]  We sent out 15,000 press releases with photos, and anybody listening could go to our website, TrendsResearch.com, TrendsResearch.com, click on Trend Alert, and you'll see it.
[01:18:52.817 --> 01:18:59.861]  No coverage, other than foreign countries, Australia and others, a few in the United States.
[01:19:00.721 --> 01:19:06.364]  If they had on those carriage steps, anti-Semitic
[01:19:07.541 --> 01:19:09.623]  Or racial graffiti?
[01:19:10.904 --> 01:19:12.565]  Boy, it would have been news.
[01:19:13.405 --> 01:19:18.109]  But anti-Trump graffiti destroying colonial Kingston, New York?
[01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:20.030]  We don't want to talk about it.
[01:19:20.891 --> 01:19:23.453]  So it's the media that's destroying this country.
[01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:28.156]  And they are doing it purposely because it also brings them ratings.
[01:19:30.118 --> 01:19:32.420]  Conte just nailed it on the head.
[01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:40.597]  And it's sad to see that these people go out, they march, they do crimes against venerable objects like the buildings that you purchased.
[01:19:41.037 --> 01:19:42.819]  And it's all over fake news.
[01:19:42.899 --> 01:19:44.040]  It's all over hype.
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.941]  It's all over lies.
[01:19:46.302 --> 01:19:50.085]  And we've got more evidence of exactly what Gerald Cilenti is talking about.
[01:19:50.446 --> 01:19:53.649]  The media spinning terror events on the other side.
[01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:54.229]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:19:54.249 --> 01:19:55.190]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:57.052]  Owen Schroer, Gerald Cilenti, with you.
[01:20:03.479 --> 01:20:03.859]  Hunters!
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:09.424]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:20:10.545 --> 01:20:27.759]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.983]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[01:20:32.743 --> 01:20:50.720]  of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and that they went for the bones first knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow but also in the bone structure itself and so I set out working with the top formulator in the country
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:21:07.031]  To develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.

[01:22:03.982 --> 01:22:12.530]  Of the 30 plus proprietary products that we've developed for Infowarslife.com, which are all amazing, DNA Force is the flagship.
[01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:21.478]  This highly advanced formula has been sold out for close to six months due to a worldwide shortage of the sought after ingredients.
[01:22:21.838 --> 01:22:39.009]  Today I'm very excited to announce that we have received a limited shipment of DNA Force and despite the fact that we have been sold out for close to six months, I'm still discounting it 20% because I want listeners and viewers that haven't tried DNA Force yet to actually get a chance to see how amazing it is.
[01:22:39.269 --> 01:22:52.995]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systemic enzymes, NaR lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many, many others that synergistically work together.

[01:24:11.994 --> 01:24:13.435]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:13.455 --> 01:24:18.620]  Owen Troyer with you, Gerald Solenti with you, and we're breaking down all the latest.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.081]  Bannon is out.
[01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:23.404]  The stock market magically recovers.
[01:24:23.884 --> 01:24:34.433]  I want to talk about that with Gerald Solenti in this segment, and then a little down the road talk more about what he's talking about with the violence being done to, well, inanimate objects.
[01:24:34.753 --> 01:24:38.255]  In this country, because of media lies and media spin.
[01:24:38.635 --> 01:24:46.098]  But Gerald, I want to get into what we saw in the last 24 to 48 hours with the stock market, with Gary Cohn, and with Stephen Bannon.
[01:24:46.378 --> 01:24:53.802]  My theory is that they used this entire stock market crash, could crash, because Bannon attacked Cohn.
[01:24:54.102 --> 01:24:54.962]  Cohn didn't like it.
[01:24:55.202 --> 01:24:58.364]  They plunged the stock market, say, get Bannon out, or Cohn's leaving.
[01:24:58.644 --> 01:25:02.126]  Then they say, okay, we'll get rid of Bannon, stock market returns, Cohn stays.
[01:25:02.166 --> 01:25:02.846]  What's your analysis?
[01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:04.470]  Well, it's right there.
[01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:05.511]  You hit the facts.
[01:25:06.092 --> 01:25:10.517]  So, the Dow is down yesterday, what, 274 points?
[01:25:11.058 --> 01:25:15.403]  And today, now it's flat after being down after they announced that Bannon's out.
[01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:19.907]  You know, all these people, by the way, Owen, that want to get rid of Trump.
[01:25:20.107 --> 01:25:21.007]  Yeah, let's get rid of him.
[01:25:21.287 --> 01:25:22.868]  Oh yeah, bring in Pence then.
[01:25:23.169 --> 01:25:24.349]  Oh, that'll be wonderful.
[01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:25.750]  And you know what that means?
[01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:27.711]  That means the gang is still in charge.
[01:25:28.132 --> 01:25:31.154]  Because Trump's an outsider, now they got the insider back in.
[01:25:31.554 --> 01:25:36.877]  So all these people that want Trump out, you know, Trump goes, then look what you got, look what you're left with.
[01:25:37.238 --> 01:25:39.459]  And you really nailed it, as Alex did earlier.
[01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:43.272]  If the market crashes, Trump crashes with it.
[01:25:43.713 --> 01:25:49.177]  Because people are forgetting the Trump rally now is going on now since November?
[01:25:50.218 --> 01:25:50.979]  Was it November?
[01:25:51.039 --> 01:25:51.659]  December?
[01:25:51.759 --> 01:25:52.320]  January?
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:52.860]  February?
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:53.120]  March?
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:54.742]  Yeah, before he was even inaugurated.
[01:25:55.482 --> 01:25:55.763]  Right.
[01:25:56.563 --> 01:25:58.765]  Nine months of a Trump rally.
[01:26:00.552 --> 01:26:06.181]  It's a Trump rally because of the things that he's promising that they're stopping him from doing.
[01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:12.350]  And that is, of course, infrastructure rebuilding, tax reform and deregulation.
[01:26:12.931 --> 01:26:14.834]  Now, I want to also mention that
[01:26:16.058 --> 01:26:20.840]  This is needed in the country and welcomed by the people.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:28.502]  And so what the media is not talking about is the renegotiations of NAFTA and how that will help us.
[01:26:29.163 --> 01:26:36.685]  So all of these anti-fascist people, hey, you want fascism, the merger of state and corporate powers?
[01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:41.727]  Hey, junior out there shooting your mouth off, how about too big to fail?
[01:26:42.207 --> 01:26:44.148]  You want to look at fascism?
[01:26:44.788 --> 01:26:48.029]  In capitalism, there's no such thing, Junior.
[01:26:48.049 --> 01:26:57.113]  Oh, all you little anti-fascist people, why don't you go after George W. Bush, who lied us into war?
[01:26:57.493 --> 01:26:59.053]  Oh, war is okay with you.
[01:26:59.494 --> 01:27:02.415]  Oh, let's take down those Confederate statues.
[01:27:02.455 --> 01:27:03.955]  That really got you upset.
[01:27:04.396 --> 01:27:10.638]  But you can launch wars based on lies that are right in front of us, Junior.
[01:27:11.556 --> 01:27:29.095]  That Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda, which was a big lie, brought to you by the prestitute media, the fake news people, and essentially the toilet paper of record, the New York Times.
[01:27:29.435 --> 01:27:33.059]  You remember, Owen, them aluminum tubes and yellow cakes that
[01:27:34.201 --> 01:27:35.422]  Hussain was bacon?
[01:27:35.942 --> 01:27:41.545]  Wait a second, the New York Times said that Donald Trump was getting wiretapped, but they didn't say it though.
[01:27:41.826 --> 01:27:43.867]  They also didn't say it, so I just want to be clear.
[01:27:43.887 --> 01:27:48.910]  They said he was getting wiretapped on their front page, but they did not ever say he was getting wiretapped.
[01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:52.372]  So where are all these anti-fascists?
[01:27:53.213 --> 01:27:55.834]  How come they don't go after the fascists?
[01:27:56.655 --> 01:27:57.015]  Oh yeah!
[01:27:58.826 --> 01:28:01.212]  That boy over there, Larry Summers.
[01:28:01.272 --> 01:28:02.375]  Yeah, Summer Jerk.
[01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:03.638]  Yeah, that guy.
[01:28:03.698 --> 01:28:06.024]  He wants to get rid of Trump.
[01:28:06.465 --> 01:28:06.525]  Oh!
[01:28:07.387 --> 01:28:08.348]  Anti-fascist?
[01:28:08.628 --> 01:28:14.592]  This is the guy that deregulated the Glass-Steagall Act, that let the big banks steal all our dough.
[01:28:14.952 --> 01:28:22.677]  Yeah, you know, the ones that paid $154 billion in fines, and not one head rolled?
[01:28:22.917 --> 01:28:27.400]  Because when Obama was candidate Obama, them heads were gonna roll, folks.
[01:28:27.781 --> 01:28:30.563]  Oh, now he's not there to folks with us anymore, huh?
[01:28:30.943 --> 01:28:32.784]  Just one lie after another.
[01:28:33.024 --> 01:28:37.067]  How come you don't go after Obama for destroying Libya?
[01:28:38.028 --> 01:28:40.389]  Oh, that's not fascist enough for you.
[01:28:40.409 --> 01:28:44.832]  Yeah, the AP was reporting new war crimes in Yemen again today from Saudi Arabia.
[01:28:45.593 --> 01:28:48.455]  Yeah, and let's go also to Syria.
[01:28:48.695 --> 01:28:49.876]  You remember, Owen?
[01:28:50.176 --> 01:28:52.878]  Assad has to go, says Obama.
[01:28:53.398 --> 01:28:54.599]  And Hillary Clinton.
[01:28:54.939 --> 01:28:56.720]  And Frankenstein Kerry.
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:57.801]  And John McCain.
[01:28:58.422 --> 01:29:00.243]  And John Insane McCain.
[01:29:02.048 --> 01:29:04.910]  Where are these fat mouths?
[01:29:05.650 --> 01:29:10.033]  Why aren't they going after the murderers and the real fascists, huh?
[01:29:11.038 --> 01:29:14.720]  The merger of state and corporate powers is there in front of us.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:18.481]  Globalization, multinationalization.
[01:29:18.802 --> 01:29:26.325]  But these little boys talk tough, but don't go after the big guys who they bow down to and suck up to.
[01:29:26.585 --> 01:29:34.749]  And when you talked about Soros before Alex was talking about it, they threw him out of Hungary because they saw what he was doing there.
[01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:36.950]  Soros not welcome.
[01:29:37.881 --> 01:29:39.923]  Yeah, it's time for us to have the same policy here.
[01:29:40.263 --> 01:29:44.827]  Stop his funding to these radical groups that are causing violence in the streets.
[01:29:45.067 --> 01:29:47.989]  We'll be right back with more of Gerald Cilenti on the other side of this break.
[01:29:48.009 --> 01:29:48.970]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:50.612]  Owen Troyer, Gerald Cilenti, with you.
[01:29:52.633 --> 01:29:53.514]  We're on the march.
[01:29:54.034 --> 01:29:55.636]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.556 --> 01:29:59.239]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.847 --> 01:30:06.428]  You cannot beat these deals.
[01:30:06.468 --> 01:30:08.409]  These are our all-time best deals.
[01:30:08.469 --> 01:30:10.710]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, 66% off.

[01:30:18.213 --> 01:30:30.298]  The BuzzFeed group promoting this said the best file in the B12 is $35 and that we're bad for selling it for $17.76, when ours is private-labeled by the very group they chose to say, here's the best, and here's Alex's.
[01:30:30.438 --> 01:30:32.459]  I mean, that's just providence that that happened.
[01:30:33.139 --> 01:30:35.081]  So BuzzFeed just says we are the best, the cleanest.
[01:30:35.401 --> 01:30:36.341]  We're just absolutely.
[01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:38.563]  And then they're just frothing, don't even know what to do.
[01:30:39.003 --> 01:30:39.964]  So please support us.
[01:30:40.064 --> 01:30:40.865]  As you know, there's a war.
[01:30:40.885 --> 01:30:42.145]  They're trying to shut everybody down.
[01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:43.006]  Please pray for us.
[01:30:43.346 --> 01:30:48.190]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:31:35.719 --> 01:31:39.162]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.

[01:32:03.857 --> 01:32:05.178]  Why is the fungus?
[01:32:05.258 --> 01:32:06.199]  Why is the mold?
[01:32:06.339 --> 01:32:07.780]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:08.900]  What is going on?
[01:32:09.061 --> 01:32:09.801]  What has changed?
[01:32:34.117 --> 01:32:35.518]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:32:35.538 --> 01:32:36.538]  I want to get your reviews.

[01:32:54.225 --> 01:32:56.526]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:32:56.546 --> 01:32:58.006]  Look at the response we're getting.

[01:33:37.823 --> 01:33:40.426]  Gerald Salente, TrendsResearch.com.
[01:33:40.446 --> 01:33:41.807]  We've got so many different places we can go.
[01:33:42.127 --> 01:33:46.451]  I want to just do a quick tease, because I think Alex is going to have to pop back in for this.
[01:33:46.491 --> 01:33:47.131]  I have to be honest.
[01:33:48.032 --> 01:33:51.776]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is now condemning Nazis.
[01:33:52.932 --> 01:33:55.154]  Alright, I'm just going to leave that right there.
[01:33:55.194 --> 01:33:56.115]  We've got the clip.
[01:33:56.275 --> 01:33:58.216]  Gerald Cilenti knows what's about to happen.
[01:33:58.577 --> 01:33:59.938]  Look at Gerald.
[01:33:59.978 --> 01:34:01.659]  Look at the smirk on Gerald's face right now.
[01:34:01.719 --> 01:34:02.860]  He knows what's going to happen.
[01:34:03.801 --> 01:34:08.405]  Alex, you have to cover Arnold Schwarzenegger condemning Nazis.
[01:34:08.545 --> 01:34:10.046]  That's 100% your name on it.
[01:34:10.226 --> 01:34:11.227]  I won't even do it justice.
[01:34:11.687 --> 01:34:14.650]  Let's get back to Gerald Cilenti from TrendsResearch.com.
[01:34:14.890 --> 01:34:16.531]  I want to talk about the media spin.
[01:34:17.512 --> 01:34:21.016]  On the Charlottesville attack versus the attack in Spain.
[01:34:21.916 --> 01:34:30.965]  So you have a boat of people arrive on a beach in Spain, clad in black, that arrive, clearly not from the country, scatter and run into the city.
[01:34:31.025 --> 01:34:31.946]  Nobody knows where they go.
[01:34:32.367 --> 01:34:33.388]  Said to be from Morocco.
[01:34:33.748 --> 01:34:37.451]  Then a Moroccan terrorist runs over people with a car, killing dozens.
[01:34:38.647 --> 01:34:41.470]  All over the media, truck attack, van attack.
[01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:49.678]  But just a week ago, when it was a white nationalist or white supremacist, it was labeled a domestic terror attack.
[01:34:50.179 --> 01:34:55.904]  Gerald, what is this trend in the media where radical Islamic people can't commit acts of terror?
[01:34:55.964 --> 01:34:57.146]  It must be the car doing it.
[01:34:58.207 --> 01:35:02.591]  Yeah, well, again, even as they're trying to compare it with Charlottesville.
[01:35:03.115 --> 01:35:05.676]  So it's the media is distorting everything.
[01:35:06.236 --> 01:35:09.197]  And again, we've never seen anything like this.
[01:35:09.257 --> 01:35:11.318]  It's in front of everybody's face.
[01:35:11.778 --> 01:35:19.961]  But what you have, Owen, are most of the people out there, they still believe in the lies of the parties that they love.
[01:35:20.721 --> 01:35:26.203]  Why would any intelligent person tune in to the mainstream media?
[01:35:26.812 --> 01:35:29.114]  When you know exactly what you're going to get.
[01:35:29.454 --> 01:35:35.158]  You're going to hear from a paid contributor from either the Republican or Democratic Party.
[01:35:35.918 --> 01:35:39.280]  So the media is just distorting this and selling hatred.
[01:35:39.601 --> 01:35:46.325]  And again, it goes back and, you know, tracking trends is an understanding of where we are, how we got here, and where we're going.
[01:35:46.906 --> 01:35:51.289]  Let's go back again with the Trump election victory.
[01:35:51.849 --> 01:35:54.711]  From day one, and even before he won,
[01:35:55.876 --> 01:35:56.937]  The Russians did it.
[01:35:57.397 --> 01:35:58.478]  The Russians did it.
[01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:00.780]  He wants to make peace with Russia.
[01:36:01.301 --> 01:36:03.002]  He wants to make deals with Russia.
[01:36:03.022 --> 01:36:04.504]  Yeah, what happened to the Russia narrative?
[01:36:06.005 --> 01:36:07.206]  So what?
[01:36:07.226 --> 01:36:10.909]  Wouldn't that be wonderful to have peace with Russia, which Russia hasn't.
[01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:21.839]  The New York Times, again the toilet paper of record, every time you read it, they use the terms that Russia invaded Crimea.
[01:36:22.768 --> 01:36:23.128]  Soros protests.
[01:36:40.936 --> 01:36:49.841]  ...was behind and is there for everybody that has a half a brain to tune in and look at Victoria Nuland, the Assistant Secretary of State, John and St.
[01:36:49.861 --> 01:36:54.223]  McCain, and that other guy, Pyatt, Jeffrey Pyatt, who was the ambassador.
[01:36:54.703 --> 01:37:02.867]  And you could hear the phone calls between Nuland and Pyatt, planning the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Yanukovych.
[01:37:03.588 --> 01:37:05.949]  The Russians didn't invade Ukraine.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.882]  But they keep selling the lies.
[01:37:08.902 --> 01:37:24.134]  So what I'm saying is, what you're talking about, how the media is portraying things, they're portraying things so that they keep building fear and hate against anybody that has a different agenda than they do.
[01:37:24.921 --> 01:37:31.825]  And it's amazing the coverage too, where they try to spin this attack in Spain and say, was it motivated by Charlottesville?
[01:37:32.105 --> 01:37:33.626]  Could it have been a copycat of Charlottesville?
[01:37:33.867 --> 01:37:34.667]  Wait, wait a second!
[01:37:34.947 --> 01:37:41.871]  There were multiple, radical, alt-Muslim attacks in Europe before the attack in Charlottesville!
[01:37:42.312 --> 01:37:42.672]  Literally!
[01:37:43.689 --> 01:37:49.531]  Again, do you think that these people over there are watching what's going on in Charlottesville?
[01:37:49.551 --> 01:37:51.772]  You know, it's a different world to them.
[01:37:52.132 --> 01:37:58.754]  But I'm trying to say that's how disgusting the media is, and that's one of the great things that Trump has done.
[01:37:58.774 --> 01:38:07.757]  He's not only exposed what a fraud the media is with its fake news, he's also exposed what a fraud Congress is.
[01:38:08.417 --> 01:38:14.441]  That's why they only have a 10% rating, and that's why they want to get him out of there.
[01:38:14.961 --> 01:38:24.147]  You pick up yesterday's New York Times, a full-page ad on how they're going to have a conference with Paul Ryan.
[01:38:24.988 --> 01:38:28.510]  Paul Ryan, a guy that never worked a day in his life.
[01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:33.233]  I think he played Eddie Munster before he became a congressman.
[01:38:33.797 --> 01:38:37.258]  Who cares what this little jerk of nothing has to say?
[01:38:37.818 --> 01:38:39.318]  But yet they're promoting it.
[01:38:39.978 --> 01:38:52.160]  So what I'm saying to you is Trump is the antithesis of the established system that has destroyed so much of what was great in this nation that they want him out.
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:56.381]  And it began before he was elected.
[01:38:56.521 --> 01:38:59.081]  And again, these are facts that people forget.
[01:39:00.422 --> 01:39:01.962]  On election eve,
[01:39:02.890 --> 01:39:11.495]  When the news that Trump was going to win the Dow futures dove 800 plus points.
[01:39:12.836 --> 01:39:19.961]  Within hours it reversed itself and now we are in one of the longest stretches
[01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:26.658]  Of hitting new record highs in the Dow since he was elected.
[01:39:27.118 --> 01:39:39.164]  Because what he was going to do for the economy, and what he's going to do for the economy, is the antithesis of the globalization multinationals.
[01:39:39.725 --> 01:39:42.226]  Look at the people that are fighting against NAFTA.
[01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:43.490]  Cargill.
[01:39:44.050 --> 01:39:44.811]  I wonder why.
[01:39:45.171 --> 01:39:53.713]  Could it be because of all that crappy GMO corn that you're selling now there, and that you put all these Mexican farmers out of business?
[01:39:54.493 --> 01:39:56.194]  No, that had nothing to do with it.
[01:39:57.014 --> 01:40:05.116]  All of this stuff has only helped the multinationals, and the facts show we've lost jobs, and we've lost income.
[01:40:05.156 --> 01:40:06.277]  Oh, here's another fact.
[01:40:07.037 --> 01:40:10.858]  Median household income in the United States right now
[01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:15.291]  Is lower than 1999 levels.
[01:40:17.251 --> 01:40:28.054]  95% of the wealth for all you liberals that loved Obama, that was created since he became president in 2009, went to the top 1%.
[01:40:29.514 --> 01:40:30.674]  Those are facts.
[01:40:31.075 --> 01:40:33.635]  A fact.
[01:40:33.655 --> 01:40:38.856]  51% of the people in America working full-time, full-time jobs, are earning $30,000 a year or less.
[01:40:41.738 --> 01:40:53.886]  So what Trump is doing with NAFTA, bringing companies like Foxconn in and Apple making their manufacturing here, this is the end.
[01:40:54.046 --> 01:40:57.829]  This was never done under the other administrations.
[01:40:58.129 --> 01:41:00.330]  It was the opposite with the deals.
[01:41:00.711 --> 01:41:02.172]  And you remember Obama.
[01:41:02.432 --> 01:41:05.454]  He was going to be the most transparent president we ever had.
[01:41:06.221 --> 01:41:15.289]  You remember him campaigning as candidate Obama in 2008, going to the Rust Belt states and saying, folks, we're going to revisit NAFTA.
[01:41:15.369 --> 01:41:16.850]  It's not fair to Americans.
[01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:21.934]  And then he brings a Trans-Pacific Partnership that we're not allowed to look at.
[01:41:22.454 --> 01:41:26.558]  So transparent, this cat, man, you could look right through him.
[01:41:27.282 --> 01:41:34.216]  So now Trump is trying to reverse that, and it's not in the best interests of the globalists.
[01:41:34.617 --> 01:41:35.939]  And that's where the fight is.
[01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:40.072]  And meanwhile, Trump is the most transparent president.
[01:41:40.872 --> 01:41:42.253]  I mean, at least in my young life.
[01:41:42.293 --> 01:41:42.833]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:41:42.893 --> 01:41:43.994]  You can comment on that, Gerald.
[01:41:44.314 --> 01:41:51.337]  But I just want to highlight what you said about the news and about Congress that I thought was so key.
[01:41:52.198 --> 01:41:58.521]  How you said that Trump has exposed the fake news and exposed the fake Congress.
[01:41:59.021 --> 01:41:59.862]  It's like Providence.
[01:42:01.283 --> 01:42:09.954]  If you had an apple, and you were told one apple is poison, one apple is good, but they both looked the same, and you're sitting here freaking out, how am I supposed to know?
[01:42:09.994 --> 01:42:10.975]  How do I know what apple to eat?
[01:42:11.055 --> 01:42:12.036]  One's going to kill me, one's not.
[01:42:12.657 --> 01:42:16.501]  And so then Trump, or God, or whatever you want to say, comes along and says, okay, you know what?
[01:42:17.273 --> 01:42:19.955]  I'm going to show you which one is poison, but you have to look.
[01:42:20.215 --> 01:42:21.156]  You have to be careful.
[01:42:21.336 --> 01:42:22.417]  You have to pay attention.
[01:42:22.637 --> 01:42:23.578]  You have to be following.
[01:42:24.018 --> 01:42:24.939]  And so he shows you.
[01:42:25.259 --> 01:42:27.821]  Look at all the fake congressmen who lied to you for seven years.
[01:42:28.081 --> 01:42:30.623]  Look at all the fake Republicans that are not working with Trump.
[01:42:30.864 --> 01:42:34.687]  Look at all the people in the media that are spinning it and lying to you about everything he says and does.
[01:42:35.567 --> 01:42:36.568]  Oh, now I see.
[01:42:36.648 --> 01:42:40.871]  This apple is a black, poisoned apple, and this one is red and good and healthy.
[01:42:41.171 --> 01:42:42.432]  I think I'm going to choose this one.
[01:42:42.752 --> 01:42:44.133]  That was an analogy I thought of.
[01:42:44.514 --> 01:42:45.114]  But what do you think?
[01:42:45.174 --> 01:42:47.756]  Is Trump the most transparent president you've ever seen in your lifetime?
[01:42:48.496 --> 01:42:50.318]  Well, yeah, in what he's doing.
[01:42:51.078 --> 01:42:56.202]  But again, going back to what you're saying about the apples, there are two rotten apples.
[01:42:56.582 --> 01:42:57.403]  Name me one.
[01:42:57.883 --> 01:43:03.167]  How could any thinking human being look up to any member of Congress?
[01:43:03.247 --> 01:43:04.228]  Which one do you like?
[01:43:04.770 --> 01:43:07.113]  Lindsey Graham, John and St.
[01:43:07.153 --> 01:43:07.793]  McCain.
[01:43:08.214 --> 01:43:10.076]  I know you love Mitch McConnell.
[01:43:10.336 --> 01:43:11.016]  No, no, no.
[01:43:11.057 --> 01:43:14.160]  Maybe, as I said, Eddie Munster's your guy.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:14.440]  No.
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:16.382]  Nancy, out of her mind.
[01:43:16.822 --> 01:43:17.483]  Pelosi.
[01:43:17.843 --> 01:43:20.066]  Diane, not so Feinstein.
[01:43:20.186 --> 01:43:21.948]  Wait a second.
[01:43:21.968 --> 01:43:26.893]  Don't forget about the millennial Maxine Waters who called Ben Carson a white nationalist today.
[01:43:27.988 --> 01:43:32.592]  Yeah, what I'm saying, how could any adult look up to these jerks?
[01:43:32.832 --> 01:43:34.614]  And then you're talking about the media.
[01:43:35.174 --> 01:43:39.978]  Oh yeah, tune in ABC and watch little Stephanopoulos there.
[01:43:40.018 --> 01:43:40.879]  Where did he come from?
[01:43:41.259 --> 01:43:47.644]  Oh, wasn't he, wasn't he the mouthpiece for the Clinton administration when Bill was in?
[01:43:48.085 --> 01:43:49.486]  Oh, I should believe him.
[01:43:49.706 --> 01:43:53.729]  Yeah, you know what, I think I'll tune into MSNBC and catch the next Brian Williams show.
[01:43:54.930 --> 01:43:56.652]  Yeah, and then, and then how about,
[01:43:57.330 --> 01:43:59.171]  Little Chris, Chrissy Cuomo.
[01:43:59.631 --> 01:44:02.792]  Another guy born on third base and thought he had a home run.
[01:44:03.052 --> 01:44:04.692]  His old man was Mario.
[01:44:05.553 --> 01:44:06.953]  His father was the governor.
[01:44:07.193 --> 01:44:09.114]  And now he got his brother the governor.
[01:44:09.554 --> 01:44:11.915]  How could people can't see what it is?
[01:44:12.235 --> 01:44:17.376]  And by the way, when I used to do CNN and all these shows, I remember when they were grooming Chris Cuomo.
[01:44:17.676 --> 01:44:19.617]  He was doing pop culture and sports.
[01:44:20.598 --> 01:44:23.160]  I mean, they used to come around with too little age, you know.
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:24.561]  I saw the whole thing happen.
[01:44:24.841 --> 01:44:28.903]  So when you're looking at the media, look at the names and the faces behind it.
[01:44:29.323 --> 01:44:38.569]  How could any thinking adult look up to or listen to the members of Congress or the people in mainstream TV?
[01:44:38.849 --> 01:44:39.490]  And they're doing it.
[01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:42.872]  And by the way, here's what the mainstream media is not talking about.
[01:44:43.928 --> 01:44:47.952]  Hey Owen, haven't heard a lot of news coming out of Syria lately, have we?
[01:44:48.072 --> 01:44:48.372]  No.
[01:44:48.492 --> 01:44:50.674]  No, things have calmed down there, haven't they?
[01:44:50.754 --> 01:44:50.974]  Yeah.
[01:44:51.074 --> 01:44:54.658]  Since Trump met Putin at the G20 meeting.
[01:44:55.258 --> 01:44:57.020]  And they agreed to cool it down.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.402]  But how did the media cover it?
[01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:03.152]  Oh, Trump spoke to Putin during the dinner.
[01:45:03.793 --> 01:45:04.393]  Remember that?
[01:45:04.893 --> 01:45:07.455]  Well, yeah, the whole Russian thing has pretty much died down.
[01:45:07.515 --> 01:45:12.699]  I just want to be clear because... But what I'm saying, though, is that Syria has cooled down.
[01:45:13.019 --> 01:45:15.580]  The war is thanks to Trump.
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:16.881]  Well, and they're beating ISIS, too.
[01:45:17.922 --> 01:45:19.663]  But they're not reporting it.
[01:45:20.424 --> 01:45:22.225]  It's not being reported.
[01:45:23.328 --> 01:45:25.590]  I just want to be clear too, I'm not saying Trump is God.
[01:45:25.650 --> 01:45:27.131]  The whole crew is freaking out apparently.
[01:45:27.231 --> 01:45:27.651]  I'm not either.
[01:45:27.952 --> 01:45:31.675]  I'm saying that you can say it's Trump or you can say it's God, you can say it's divine.
[01:45:31.695 --> 01:45:37.019]  I'm just saying it's so clear who is fake and who is real in Congress and in media.
[01:45:37.239 --> 01:45:38.020]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:40.602]  Whether you want to say it's Trump or God, I'm just saying that's what's happening.
[01:45:40.902 --> 01:45:44.945]  Alright, Gerald, Alex wants us to get to this Arnold Schwarzenegger clip, so stay with me here.
[01:45:45.546 --> 01:45:46.607]  Arnold Schwarzenegger
[01:45:47.347 --> 01:45:55.637]  Somebody who saluted Nazis and I believe has even donned the Hugo Boss Nazi uniform and marched around his house.
[01:45:55.697 --> 01:46:02.285]  Again, Alex is much more well-versed on this than I. But here is Arnold Schwarzenegger condemning Nazis.
[01:46:03.643 --> 01:46:07.385]  There are not two sides to bigotry, and there are not two sides to hatred.
[01:46:07.626 --> 01:46:13.570]  And if you choose to march with a flag that symbolizes the slaughter of millions of people, there are not two sides to that.
[01:46:13.730 --> 01:46:21.235]  The only way to beat the loud and angry voices of hate is to meet them a bit louder, in more reasonable voices.
[01:46:22.035 --> 01:46:24.036]  And that includes you, President Trump.
[01:46:24.317 --> 01:46:28.840]  In fact, as President of this great country, you have a moral responsibility.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:34.122]  To send an un-Republican message that you won't stand for hate and racism.
[01:46:35.203 --> 01:46:37.644]  Now let me help you write your speech here a little bit.
[01:46:37.664 --> 01:46:43.667]  As President of the United States and as a Republican, I reject the support of white supremacists.
[01:46:44.727 --> 01:46:48.969]  The country that defeated Hitler's armies is no place for Nazi flags.
[01:46:49.929 --> 01:46:55.832]  The party of Lincoln won't stand with those who carry the battle flag of the failed Confederacy.
[01:46:56.312 --> 01:46:57.253]  Was that that difficult?
[01:46:58.399 --> 01:46:59.300]  You see, I told you.
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:00.700]  A Trump bobblehead.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.042]  I have a message to the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists.
[01:47:04.062 --> 01:47:05.123]  That Trump condemned and disavowed.
[01:47:05.163 --> 01:47:05.903]  And the neo-Confederates.
[01:47:06.384 --> 01:47:08.385]  Let me be just as blunt as possible.
[01:47:08.705 --> 01:47:10.626]  You heroes are losers.
[01:47:11.146 --> 01:47:12.707]  You're supporting a lost cause.
[01:47:12.907 --> 01:47:15.229]  And believe me, I know the original Nazis.
[01:47:15.329 --> 01:47:16.709]  I was born in Austria in 1927.
[01:47:16.789 --> 01:47:17.930]  Oh, he knew the Nazis, Gerald!
[01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:18.590]  How did he like that?
[01:47:19.831 --> 01:47:20.572]  He knows him well.
[01:47:20.592 --> 01:47:21.012]  Losing ideology.
[01:47:21.032 --> 01:47:22.913]  The people that supported Hillary Clinton.
[01:47:39.782 --> 01:47:40.182]  In hell.
[01:47:40.582 --> 01:47:43.663]  I know that you weren't born with these hateful views.
[01:47:44.183 --> 01:47:44.603]  No one is.
[01:47:44.964 --> 01:47:54.486]  But the truth is, it's never too late to make the choices, to learn and to evolve, and to understand that all human beings have equal value.
[01:47:55.226 --> 01:47:59.288]  If you say, Arnold, hey, I was just at the march, don't call me a Nazi.
[01:47:59.328 --> 01:48:01.188]  Wait, he just said Nazis didn't have equal value, so I don't know.
[01:48:01.228 --> 01:48:01.668]  Let me help you.
[01:48:01.688 --> 01:48:02.008]  I'm confused.
[01:48:02.028 --> 01:48:05.769]  Don't hang around people who carry Nazi flags, give Nazi salutes, or shout Nazi slogans.
[01:48:05.789 --> 01:48:06.690]  Didn't he do that though?
[01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:08.330]  Go home.
[01:48:08.850 --> 01:48:13.893]  Or better yet, tell them that they're wrong to celebrate... Didn't he wear Nazi SS uniforms?
[01:48:14.133 --> 01:48:15.233]  ...millions of people.
[01:48:16.034 --> 01:48:16.794]  And then go home.
[01:48:17.154 --> 01:48:20.096]  You're so lucky to live in a country that gives you every right.
[01:48:20.616 --> 01:48:21.256]  I mean, it's nice.
[01:48:21.316 --> 01:48:22.016]  It's Hugo Boss.
[01:48:22.276 --> 01:48:26.558]  But think about how you could actually use that power for something good.
[01:48:27.379 --> 01:48:28.899]  No, that's what you need to do, Arnold.
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:30.200]  You must also evolve.
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:36.263]  I've learned a long time ago that the only way we can really eliminate hatred is to face it head on.
[01:48:36.923 --> 01:48:38.605]  This is an embarrassment to the country.
[01:48:39.286 --> 01:48:40.027]  This is just an embarrassment.
[01:48:50.189 --> 01:48:57.054]  Not even a year removed from Barack Obama and we're all racist.
[01:48:57.114 --> 01:49:00.136]  Not even a year removed, they just toss Obama aside.
[01:49:00.156 --> 01:49:01.617]  Nope, didn't happen, you're racist.
[01:49:01.697 --> 01:49:02.538]  Oh, thank God he donated money.
[01:49:02.578 --> 01:49:03.818]  He did it, he solved it all.
[01:49:19.369 --> 01:49:19.809]  Thank you, Arnold.
[01:49:19.829 --> 01:49:19.969]  Okay.
[01:49:19.989 --> 01:49:20.410]  Yes, let's do that.
[01:49:37.402 --> 01:49:43.064]  Share this video if you think that hatred... Okay, so Arnold Schwarzenegger just showed himself as a bad apple.
[01:49:44.065 --> 01:49:46.226]  Are we gonna start changing the names of these schools, too?
[01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:47.886]  Don't forget all of these schools in the South.
[01:49:47.926 --> 01:49:52.608]  The Ole Miss Rebels, all these high schools named after the Rebels, that have the Rebel flag.
[01:49:52.628 --> 01:49:54.389]  Are we gonna start changing those names, too, Gerald?
[01:49:55.490 --> 01:50:00.512]  Again, you know, listening to this guy, I mean, why would anybody pay any attention to him?
[01:50:01.112 --> 01:50:02.112]  You know, he's a nobody.
[01:50:02.132 --> 01:50:03.533]  What are you talking about?
[01:50:03.593 --> 01:50:06.034]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is a time traveler that fights demons.
[01:50:06.752 --> 01:50:08.093]  Yeah, I forgot.
[01:50:10.174 --> 01:50:19.518]  The other thing is that these little hypocrites, how come they're not speaking out against wars?
[01:50:20.118 --> 01:50:28.022]  That the United States has murdered millions of innocent people based on lies, Arnold!
[01:50:28.522 --> 01:50:30.183]  Or I should call you Arnie.
[01:50:31.678 --> 01:50:37.602]  Where's your... How come you weren't coming out against Obama, folks, when he launched the Libyan war?
[01:50:38.162 --> 01:50:41.104]  When he increased the troop strength in Afghanistan.
[01:50:41.124 --> 01:50:43.125]  33,000 troops.
[01:50:43.385 --> 01:50:46.087]  The Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[01:50:46.507 --> 01:50:47.428]  Where were you?
[01:50:47.548 --> 01:50:50.470]  Where are all you gutless little people?
[01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:58.918]  And it's just amazing to me, if you actually want something to condemn Trump on, look at what happened in Yemen, and look at the Saudi Arabian arms deal.
[01:50:59.138 --> 01:51:00.019]  They don't even mention that!
[01:51:00.059 --> 01:51:01.460]  They actually have something they could mention!
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:01.921]  Silence!
[01:51:03.362 --> 01:51:03.782]  Are you what?
[01:51:34.143 --> 01:51:41.027]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[01:51:41.287 --> 01:51:45.530]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
[01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:51.014]  And it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[01:51:51.074 --> 01:51:54.056]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[01:51:54.316 --> 01:51:55.537]  It's Brain Force Plus.

[01:52:04.142 --> 01:52:06.703]  Eddie is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:52:06.983 --> 01:52:08.464]  Those times may be near.
[01:52:08.584 --> 01:52:09.144]  Think about it.
[01:52:09.484 --> 01:52:13.806]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:52:14.106 --> 01:52:18.728]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:52:19.088 --> 01:52:24.712]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:52:24.893 --> 01:52:31.298]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:52:31.598 --> 01:52:34.140]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:37.061]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.
[01:52:37.401 --> 01:52:39.623]  Get a four-week survival food supply for only $99.

[01:53:01.994 --> 01:53:05.457]  If you had purchased $100 of Bitcoin in 2010, today you'd have $2,600,000.

[01:53:31.716 --> 01:53:32.436]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:53:32.596 --> 01:53:34.877]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:53:34.977 --> 01:53:42.881]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:53:43.021 --> 01:53:44.862]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:53:44.942 --> 01:53:48.443]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[01:53:57.667 --> 01:53:58.308]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:10.841]  This is honestly incredible.
[01:54:11.481 --> 01:54:13.041]  I've got a story here from October 2012.
[01:54:13.902 --> 01:54:18.564]  Total Recall, Arnold Schwarzenegger did express admiration for Adolf Hitler.
[01:54:18.964 --> 01:54:21.865]  That was in his book, Total Recall, when he wrote about it.
[01:54:22.265 --> 01:54:24.907]  Wow, but today he condemns anyone that would stand with Hitler.
[01:54:24.947 --> 01:54:31.412]  So, you've got Arnold Schwarzenegger writing about how he admires Hitler, and then today saying how you shouldn't admire Hitler, or you're a racist.
[01:54:31.852 --> 01:54:44.762]  You have the right, being all of the Republicans, literally everyone on the right, everyone on the right has to disavow the Nazis, and has to disavow the KKK, which were both created by leftists!
[01:54:46.383 --> 01:54:49.185]  Have you ever seen anything like this in your life, Gerald Cilenti?
[01:54:50.256 --> 01:54:52.317]  I've never seen a nation divided like this.
[01:54:52.457 --> 01:54:57.200]  And again, the hypocrisy coming from Schwarzenegger on other issues.
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:58.941]  And we're not a racist nation.
[01:54:59.462 --> 01:55:03.264]  A racist nation does not elect a black president.
[01:55:03.284 --> 01:55:04.645]  Could anybody add that up?
[01:55:05.145 --> 01:55:05.785]  Are there races?
[01:55:05.865 --> 01:55:06.486]  I don't get it.
[01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:07.847]  I don't understand.
[01:55:08.587 --> 01:55:10.408]  And I want to make this also clear.
[01:55:11.329 --> 01:55:13.050]  Not everything Trump does, I agree with.
[01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:16.632]  You know, we write about it in, you know, well, I call
[01:55:17.395 --> 01:55:18.516]  What is, what is.
[01:55:18.856 --> 01:55:22.578]  But I couldn't say these things under the last few administrations.
[01:55:23.279 --> 01:55:25.900]  I never had a president coming out against NAFTA.
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:27.341]  Instead, they were pushing it to us.
[01:55:27.982 --> 01:55:31.624]  We didn't have a president trying to renegotiate the trade deals.
[01:55:31.944 --> 01:55:33.465]  Instead, they were selling them to us.
[01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:35.487]  Is there everything I agree with Trump?
[01:55:35.627 --> 01:55:35.847]  No.
[01:55:36.287 --> 01:55:37.648]  But these are positive things.
[01:55:37.768 --> 01:55:41.370]  And the other one, I'm 100% in favor of.
[01:55:42.211 --> 01:55:44.032]  No more immigration.
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:47.562]  And I'm not talking about Islamists or Muslims.
[01:55:47.602 --> 01:55:50.183]  I'm not talking about no more anybodies.
[01:55:50.584 --> 01:55:53.926]  Not from Ireland, not from Israel, not from Italy.
[01:55:54.466 --> 01:55:55.367]  We have enough.
[01:55:56.227 --> 01:56:01.891]  Go back to the plan that they put in place during the Great Depression.
[01:56:02.591 --> 01:56:09.115]  Earlier, Owen, I gave you some stats on how the middle class in this country is dying.
[01:56:10.453 --> 01:56:15.856]  We cannot afford to take in more people until we get back on our feet.
[01:56:16.637 --> 01:56:29.225]  Anybody out there shooting their mouth off, bringing more immigrants, open up your house, feed them, pay for their schooling and their health care.
[01:56:29.565 --> 01:56:32.447]  If that's your trip, man, knock yourself out.
[01:56:33.227 --> 01:56:39.211]  I want, look, I remember when I was a little kid growing up, relatives from Italy couldn't come here.
[01:56:39.801 --> 01:56:41.222]  They weren't taking people in.
[01:56:42.002 --> 01:56:43.783]  They had very tight quotas.
[01:56:44.303 --> 01:56:52.588]  Who made up this stuff that we need another couple of hundred million people when we can't take care of our own already?
[01:56:53.028 --> 01:56:54.869]  This is pure stupidity.
[01:56:55.209 --> 01:56:57.811]  So I'm 100% on board.
[01:56:58.291 --> 01:57:05.215]  No more immigration until our economy and our country gets back on its feet.
[01:57:05.759 --> 01:57:06.579]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:57:06.599 --> 01:57:11.601]  The other side of the debate that you just brought up is not an intellectual.
[01:57:12.221 --> 01:57:17.343]  It's bought and paid for politicians and then they're brainwashed minions because of their bought and paid for media.
[01:57:17.763 --> 01:57:26.766]  Everything you just said is highly intellectual, makes common sense, but you'll never actually get to have that dialogue with the other side.
[01:57:26.806 --> 01:57:30.687]  They'll just ram it through with their brainwashed minions and their bought and paid for politicians.
[01:57:31.508 --> 01:57:32.368]  And you left one out.
[01:57:33.561 --> 01:57:37.725]  The prostitute media, they never talk about it.
[01:57:38.605 --> 01:57:47.774]  Prostitute days, they get paid to put out from their Washington Johns and their corporate... You know who they are.
[01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:48.754]  The corporate whores.
[01:57:49.475 --> 01:57:49.735]  Yeah.
[01:57:50.016 --> 01:57:52.358]  The national, the global.
[01:57:53.098 --> 01:57:54.880]  They get paid to put out.
[01:57:55.765 --> 01:57:56.906]  They're prostitutes.
[01:57:57.326 --> 01:57:58.847]  Nobody talks about this.
[01:57:59.167 --> 01:58:04.390]  Nobody goes back to the 1930s of how they closed down immigration.
[01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:06.651]  We could not take care of our own.
[01:58:06.911 --> 01:58:07.892]  You're going to bring in more.
[01:58:07.952 --> 01:58:12.735]  And again, anybody out there, all you marchers that want to bring in more people,
[01:58:13.928 --> 01:58:15.369]  Put your money where your mouth is.
[01:58:15.609 --> 01:58:16.589]  Open your house up.
[01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:19.091]  Pay for them, if that's what you believe.
[01:58:19.111 --> 01:58:20.452]  I don't want to pay for them.
[01:58:20.872 --> 01:58:22.833]  I pay enough in taxes already.
[01:58:23.233 --> 01:58:27.635]  You're wasting my dough with stupid school systems and inefficient governments.
[01:58:27.996 --> 01:58:29.576]  I don't want to pay for others.
[01:58:30.597 --> 01:58:31.658]  You know, that's an amazing point.
[01:58:32.018 --> 01:58:39.102]  All of these brainwashed LARPers out on the street, we need to really be questioning our public education system that this is what it's putting out.
[01:58:39.142 --> 01:58:40.082]  I mean, that is an embarrassment.
[01:58:40.262 --> 01:58:41.623]  We'll be right back with more of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:44.751 --> 01:58:46.615]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:48.157 --> 01:58:50.361]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:54.051 --> 01:58:57.592]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:58:58.052 --> 01:59:04.093]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:59:04.493 --> 01:59:07.294]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:07.674 --> 01:59:10.675]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:59:10.875 --> 01:59:14.316]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:59:14.656 --> 01:59:15.116]  The left
[01:59:15.656 --> 01:59:26.081]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:59:26.141 --> 01:59:28.542]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:59:29.022 --> 01:59:32.884]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:59:32.944 --> 01:59:41.028]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:59:41.268 --> 01:59:43.969]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[01:59:44.369 --> 01:59:47.510]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:59:47.590 --> 01:59:49.290]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:59:49.450 --> 01:59:50.631]  It's available right now.
[01:59:50.931 --> 01:59:53.512]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:56.232 --> 02:00:02.114]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.767 --> 02:00:26.230]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:00:26.831 --> 02:00:28.272]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.593 --> 02:00:34.015]  There's so much breaking right now.
[02:00:34.055 --> 02:00:34.976]  There's so much to cover.
[02:00:35.016 --> 02:00:36.517]  It's like, how do you decide?
[02:00:36.537 --> 02:00:43.083]  You've got terror attacks happening around the world because of alt-Muslims, but then they want to blame the right for everything.
[02:00:43.664 --> 02:00:45.846]  You've got fake news attacking Trump all day long.
[02:00:46.527 --> 02:00:47.788]  What happened to the Russia narrative?
[02:00:47.968 --> 02:00:51.812]  That disappears as soon as Robert Mueller's team is starting to abandon him.
[02:00:52.827 --> 02:00:59.112]  You've got the stock market being used as leverage to remove people from Trump's White House team.
[02:01:01.173 --> 02:01:01.814]  It's really unbelievable.
[02:01:01.834 --> 02:01:08.139]  You've got a march today where KKK, okay, why is the KKK just sprouting up out of nowhere?
[02:01:08.559 --> 02:01:09.900]  I mean, how is this happening?
[02:01:10.761 --> 02:01:16.725]  Okay, so now these freaks are marching, claiming they're KKK, and then of course you get the counter-protesters, and then the mainstream news.
[02:01:17.606 --> 02:01:20.647]  Well, you know, I just want to follow up on something you said before the break.
[02:01:20.907 --> 02:01:22.888]  We're talking about the education system.
[02:01:22.908 --> 02:01:27.749]  If the education system was working in this country, do you think we'd be in the problems that we have?
[02:01:27.789 --> 02:01:28.549]  It's a joke.
[02:01:46.403 --> 02:01:52.007]  We don't even win places show when you come to OECD statistics compared to other countries.
[02:01:52.407 --> 02:01:57.131]  Yet they keep stealing our dough for a lousy, stinking, rotten education system.
[02:01:57.611 --> 02:02:00.914]  Not only, and then the other thing is, these non-profits.
[02:02:01.294 --> 02:02:07.799]  All of these big universities, whether it's Columbia, NYU, you name the place, they're all, they don't pay taxes.
[02:02:07.839 --> 02:02:08.920]  Yeah, they're all in debt too.
[02:02:10.049 --> 02:02:20.296]  Non-profits, and the presidents, and these guys, they're coaches, they make all of these millions of dollars that we're subsidizing.
[02:02:20.437 --> 02:02:33.306]  And number three, when I was talking about the economy, which really we should be focusing on as a nation, and I talked about statistics before, now you're getting out of college with what, $80,000 in debt?
[02:02:34.126 --> 02:02:36.168]  Home ownership right now, Owen?
[02:02:36.997 --> 02:02:39.738]  ...is at 50-year lows.
[02:02:40.298 --> 02:02:42.338]  The millennials can't afford them.
[02:02:43.159 --> 02:02:47.180]  So what's happened is, oh, you got that degree in worthlessness, huh?
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:48.980]  I got it in gender studies.
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:49.540]  Great.
[02:02:49.921 --> 02:02:50.741]  You can do a lot with that.
[02:02:50.761 --> 02:02:52.021]  But I got it from university.
[02:02:52.041 --> 02:02:54.702]  I got it from State U. Yeah.
[02:02:55.622 --> 02:02:57.483]  Is it State U or is it F-U?
[02:02:58.743 --> 02:02:59.943]  Because that's what happens.
[02:03:01.104 --> 02:03:02.124]  Yeah, that's what you got.
[02:03:02.224 --> 02:03:05.525]  Well, you just said something that's so key, though, that America wouldn't even think.
[02:03:06.451 --> 02:03:11.676]  You have coaches, basketball coaches, football coaches, making millions and millions of dollars.
[02:03:12.076 --> 02:03:12.517]  Guess what?
[02:03:12.597 --> 02:03:15.640]  At every university, guess who the most highest paid employee is?
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.042]  Either the football or the basketball coach.
[02:03:18.442 --> 02:03:24.908]  If these universities spent half as much energy on hiring professors as they did on sports coaches, we might have a chance.
[02:03:25.048 --> 02:03:25.409]  We might!
[02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:28.011]  But again, the whole system stinks.
[02:03:28.391 --> 02:03:30.493]  By their deeds you shall know them.
[02:03:30.913 --> 02:03:33.495]  Look at the shape our country is in.
[02:03:33.976 --> 02:03:38.139]  We spend more money on education just about than anybody else in the world.
[02:03:38.759 --> 02:03:45.645]  And look at if we were educated people that had brains, do you think we'd be in the problems that we have?
[02:03:46.225 --> 02:03:49.328]  So why can't anybody call a spade a spade?
[02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:51.600]  Nobody wants to.
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:54.701]  Gerald, you've got... Oh, and that wasn't racist, by the way.
[02:03:55.501 --> 02:03:57.022]  Just to make it clear.
[02:03:57.042 --> 02:04:00.002]  You know, all you all lefts over there, take it easy.
[02:04:00.062 --> 02:04:01.223]  Yeah, they're going to cut that out now.
[02:04:01.243 --> 02:04:02.963]  Logan, it goes back way too long.
[02:04:03.203 --> 02:04:05.404]  A spade is a thing you put in the ground, alright?
[02:04:05.484 --> 02:04:06.124]  Take it easy.
[02:04:06.504 --> 02:04:07.824]  No, they're going to attack you for that.
[02:04:07.984 --> 02:04:09.625]  Gerald, we've got 60 seconds left.
[02:04:09.725 --> 02:04:13.065]  Final comments before you go your separate way.
[02:04:13.145 --> 02:04:14.046]  Watch the markets.
[02:04:14.106 --> 02:04:15.766]  The markets are going to tell the story here.
[02:04:16.206 --> 02:04:18.587]  The markets go down really bad, so does Trump.
[02:04:20.237 --> 02:04:24.002]  And as Alex pointed out, and you did too, with Bannon out, the markets went up.
[02:04:24.443 --> 02:04:25.444]  Very key to watch.
[02:04:25.504 --> 02:04:26.305]  The markets are going to tell the tale.
[02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:28.989]  Do you think they're going to continue to do this with everyone they want to get ousted?
[02:04:29.049 --> 02:04:30.250]  Just use the markets as leverage?
[02:04:30.931 --> 02:04:33.074]  I think they got rid of just about everybody that they want.
[02:04:33.701 --> 02:04:35.142]  I think they're going to come after Kushner.
[02:04:35.362 --> 02:04:36.682]  I think they're going to come after Gorka.
[02:04:36.762 --> 02:04:38.223]  I think they're going to come after Kellyanne.
[02:04:38.703 --> 02:04:40.804]  Not that I even like Kellyanne.
[02:04:40.864 --> 02:04:43.586]  Yeah, they don't throw that much weight.
[02:04:43.666 --> 02:04:45.246]  Kushner is the son-in-law.
[02:04:45.506 --> 02:04:46.447]  He ain't going anywhere.
[02:04:46.687 --> 02:04:47.527]  I'll see you for dinner.
[02:04:47.867 --> 02:04:49.868]  Gerald Solenti, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:04:50.088 --> 02:04:51.709]  Powerful information, as always.
[02:04:51.949 --> 02:04:52.890]  We'll be back on the other side.
[02:04:52.930 --> 02:04:55.051]  Lee Stranahan and Roger Stone in studio.
[02:04:55.091 --> 02:04:55.531]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:15.912]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[02:05:16.092 --> 02:05:23.480]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWars Life family, true whey protein from InfoWars Life.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:29.743]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high-quality organic conditions.
[02:05:30.303 --> 02:05:37.046]  Our True Whey Protein from Infowars Life contains a whopping 20 grams of protein per serving.
[02:05:37.486 --> 02:05:44.649]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[02:05:44.889 --> 02:05:57.515]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies to bring you a super high quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[02:05:58.015 --> 02:06:05.579]  That way you get the benefits and the taste of high quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[02:06:05.899 --> 02:06:08.420]  Doing our research, one thing continues to really stand out.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:17.644]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[02:06:18.044 --> 02:06:18.865]  That is essential.
[02:06:19.245 --> 02:06:23.527]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[02:06:24.027 --> 02:06:26.468]  This is the very best whey that we were able to bring to market.
[02:06:26.828 --> 02:06:28.529]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:30.289]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.
[02:06:30.810 --> 02:06:33.331]  It is true whey from mfulwhoreslife.com.
[02:06:34.833 --> 02:06:39.716]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[02:06:40.517 --> 02:06:43.459]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[02:06:44.119 --> 02:06:46.921]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[02:06:47.542 --> 02:06:52.425]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[02:06:52.785 --> 02:06:59.089]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[02:06:59.449 --> 02:07:04.613]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[02:07:05.273 --> 02:07:08.734]  That's why I recommend Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[02:07:09.274 --> 02:07:17.097]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[02:07:17.677 --> 02:07:22.018]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[02:07:22.359 --> 02:07:26.280]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:30.401]  Stay in the game with Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.

[02:07:47.106 --> 02:07:59.192]  The BuzzFeed group promoting this said the best vial of B12 is $35, and that we're bad for selling it for $17.76, when ours is private-labeled by the very group they chose to say, here's the best, and here's Alex's.
[02:07:59.312 --> 02:08:01.353]  I mean, that's just providence that that happened.
[02:08:02.033 --> 02:08:03.974]  So BuzzFeed just says we are the best, the cleanest.
[02:08:04.294 --> 02:08:05.235]  We're just absolutely.
[02:08:05.575 --> 02:08:07.456]  And then they're just frothing, don't even know what to do.
[02:08:07.896 --> 02:08:08.856]  So please support us.
[02:08:08.956 --> 02:08:09.817]  As you know, there's a war.
[02:08:09.837 --> 02:08:11.037]  They're trying to shut everybody down.
[02:08:11.077 --> 02:08:11.878]  Please pray for us.
[02:08:12.238 --> 02:08:17.080]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:20.842]  Got the Super Blue Fluoride Free with the Colloidal Silver and Iodine Toothpaste Pack.

[02:08:31.387 --> 02:08:32.407]  Just make the commitment.
[02:08:33.668 --> 02:08:46.534]  Well, him getting attacked in the streets of Seattle, him breaking down that, we got Bannon ousted, we got the stock market being used as leverage, and all kinds of breaking news with the media trying to incite race war and civil war.
[02:08:46.975 --> 02:08:48.495]  We're about to be joined by Lee Stranahan.
[02:08:48.515 --> 02:08:50.036]  He's got some updates on Bannon.
[02:08:50.056 --> 02:08:53.818]  He obviously knows what's going on with the Ukrainian-Clinton connection.
[02:08:53.858 --> 02:08:55.399]  Roger Stone about to join us as well, but folks,
[02:08:56.414 --> 02:08:58.054]  We're able to get all these great guests on.
[02:08:58.074 --> 02:09:04.836]  We're able to get these people in studio because of you going to InfoWarsTore.com and taking advantage of our specials.
[02:09:05.016 --> 02:09:07.957]  Specifically today, the BuzzFeed Mega Specials.

[02:09:15.718 --> 02:09:16.178]  Secret 12, 55% off.
[02:09:16.198 --> 02:09:18.039]  All of those highly rated, number one products.
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:24.020]  Are under $20.
[02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:26.521]  You can get that entire stock for under $60.
[02:09:26.741 --> 02:09:28.302]  That is a great deal.
[02:09:28.982 --> 02:09:31.863]  And it just, the savings continue.
[02:09:31.903 --> 02:09:33.464]  Silver Bullet, 66% off.

[02:09:43.287 --> 02:09:46.128]  This is all while supplies last.
[02:09:46.648 --> 02:09:51.030]  And most of the time when people do have fill-in hosts, they tell them to plug every segment in and out.
[02:09:51.590 --> 02:09:54.231]  That's not what Alex Jones wants me to do.
[02:09:54.271 --> 02:09:55.131]  He wants me to cover news.
[02:09:55.171 --> 02:09:57.111]  So, when we do plug, please support us.
[02:09:57.152 --> 02:09:58.412]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.

[02:10:00.432 --> 02:10:02.513]  And we bring you the news all the time before we even plug.

[02:10:03.613 --> 02:10:04.373]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:10:04.393 --> 02:10:05.194]  They want to shut us down.
[02:10:05.234 --> 02:10:06.334]  We need to remain independent.
[02:10:06.414 --> 02:10:10.715]  And that happens with your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:10:11.155 --> 02:10:13.596]  So, I'm now joined by Lee Stranahan, who is
[02:10:14.915 --> 02:10:21.420]  He's really been at the root of the Clinton-Ukrainian connection that has been ignored for the most part by the mainstream media.
[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:23.042]  Last week, Lee, they gave you a little credit.
[02:10:23.062 --> 02:10:23.882]  They started to cover it.
[02:10:24.202 --> 02:10:26.404]  But let's start out by talking about Bannon.
[02:10:26.965 --> 02:10:27.645]  You know Bannon.
[02:10:27.665 --> 02:10:28.986]  You've been in talks with Bannon.
[02:10:29.767 --> 02:10:32.049]  What is your reaction right now to the ousting of Steve Bannon?
[02:10:33.137 --> 02:10:36.762]  Well, you know, they say, be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.
[02:10:37.243 --> 02:10:42.730]  The globalists who pushed Steve Bannon out have just unleashed the beast, Owen.
[02:10:43.151 --> 02:10:45.434]  This is the worst nightmare for them.
[02:10:46.596 --> 02:10:50.061]  Steve, now first off again, Steve, Andrew Breitbart and I
[02:10:50.928 --> 02:10:55.069]  Co-narrated a film Steve Bannon directed called Occupy Unmasked.
[02:10:55.149 --> 02:11:02.131]  Anybody who's not seen that, I would suggest re-watching it in the light of what we've seen with the re-up of the race war.
[02:11:02.171 --> 02:11:03.411]  That film is very prescient.
[02:11:03.791 --> 02:11:05.892]  And Bannon hired me over at Breitbart.
[02:11:06.852 --> 02:11:07.512]  Couple things.
[02:11:07.632 --> 02:11:11.393]  First off, when Bannon took the job with Trump,
[02:11:12.617 --> 02:11:14.599]  This is a guy who likes the microphone.
[02:11:14.679 --> 02:11:16.860]  Steve is not shy about his opinions.
[02:11:17.461 --> 02:11:26.668]  But he immediately subjugated his own ego to the Trump campaign, and you've only heard from him really a couple of times since then.
[02:11:27.989 --> 02:11:34.994]  And that's too bad, because Steve is one of the most articulate believers and supporters of populism out there.
[02:11:35.575 --> 02:11:36.555]  So, two things.
[02:11:36.695 --> 02:11:37.276]  Number one,
[02:11:39.841 --> 02:11:45.706]  For the people who are inside the White House and outside the Liberals, again, you just unleashed the beast.
[02:11:45.746 --> 02:11:50.249]  But the other problem was after Bannon left Breitbart, they lost it.
[02:11:51.070 --> 02:11:54.733]  There's a New York Times article right now, 5,000-word piece on Breitbart.
[02:11:54.893 --> 02:12:00.658]  I've been saying this for months, but they say it themselves in this big puff piece in the New York Times about Breitbart.
[02:12:01.018 --> 02:12:04.421]  Breitbart wants to be liked, okay?
[02:12:04.841 --> 02:12:07.163]  And Andrew Breitbart talked about the danger of that.
[02:12:08.192 --> 02:12:17.735]  He used to talk about, he said, when he learned to hate, look, if Alex wanted to suddenly be liked by the establishment, what would that do to InfoWars, right?
[02:12:18.075 --> 02:12:19.055]  It would demolish it.
[02:12:19.695 --> 02:12:21.936]  You cannot, they'll never like you.
[02:12:22.116 --> 02:12:23.456]  First off, they'll never like you.
[02:12:24.316 --> 02:12:26.917]  The only way they'll like you if you're a complete traitor.
[02:12:28.097 --> 02:12:29.057]  They'll never like you.
[02:12:29.397 --> 02:12:32.598]  And furthermore, you diminish your position.
[02:12:32.638 --> 02:12:35.119]  So take Charlottesville, just a simple example.
[02:12:36.025 --> 02:12:37.526]  We have the moral high ground.
[02:12:37.846 --> 02:12:40.447]  The leftists in the media don't have the moral high ground.
[02:12:40.947 --> 02:12:42.788]  Our position is very straightforward.
[02:12:43.308 --> 02:12:44.649]  Owen, I'll ask you.
[02:12:44.969 --> 02:12:47.330]  Just answer without equivocation.
[02:12:47.690 --> 02:12:49.551]  Do you oppose political violence?
[02:12:49.991 --> 02:12:50.532]  Absolutely.
[02:12:51.212 --> 02:12:51.452]  Right.
[02:12:51.732 --> 02:12:53.493]  That was easy for you to say, right?
[02:12:53.533 --> 02:12:54.674]  It's easy for me to say.
[02:12:55.094 --> 02:12:56.054]  They can't say it.
[02:12:56.174 --> 02:12:57.655]  The leftists can't say it.
[02:12:59.801 --> 02:13:01.642]  And even the Republicans can't say it.
[02:13:01.982 --> 02:13:03.723]  So we have the moral high ground.
[02:13:04.023 --> 02:13:06.545]  We're the people who oppose all political violence.
[02:13:06.885 --> 02:13:12.268]  When I see someone who's a white nationalist run a car into people, I'm opposed to identity politics.
[02:13:12.608 --> 02:13:15.890]  When I see an Islamist do it, I'm opposed to identity politics.
[02:13:16.271 --> 02:13:18.312]  There's not two sides, there's one side.
[02:13:18.712 --> 02:13:20.973]  And that's what the Ukrainian story, by the way, really shows.
[02:13:21.013 --> 02:13:22.134]  We'll talk about that in a second.
[02:13:23.295 --> 02:13:28.978]  But so many Republicans, and a lot of libertarians,
[02:13:29.713 --> 02:13:30.874]  No, don't worry, I got my caffeine too.
[02:13:30.894 --> 02:13:32.855]  And it's an interesting point that you made about Bannon.
[02:13:51.187 --> 02:13:53.169]  It's an amazing point you made about Bannon.
[02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:54.531]  I completely agree with you.
[02:13:55.171 --> 02:13:57.474]  And it's also complete veritas.
[02:13:57.554 --> 02:13:58.475]  Everything you broke down.
[02:13:58.555 --> 02:13:59.576]  Great points from Lee Stranahan.
[02:13:59.796 --> 02:14:01.338]  I'm now joined in studio by Roger Stone.
[02:14:01.618 --> 02:14:02.880]  Let's get your quick take real quick.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:03.741]  What happened to Bannon?
[02:14:04.537 --> 02:14:06.257]  Well, I think he died of his own hand.
[02:14:06.318 --> 02:14:19.521]  I mean, I wrote for the Daily Caller yesterday, a piece more in sadness than anger, that on the key issues that matter to conservatives, but more importantly to Trump supporters, he just has not stood tall.
[02:14:19.841 --> 02:14:28.644]  When Joe Arpaio can't get his calls returned, when he calls the White House to tell them how he's being abused by the Trump Justice Department,
[02:14:29.344 --> 02:14:30.505]  Something wrong with the system.
[02:14:31.025 --> 02:14:47.174]  When Steve Bannon is championing the appointment of Rex Tillerson, whose chief patron is Condoleezza Rice, and we now have a Trump State Department completely peopled with Bush-Romney retreads, there's something fundamentally wrong.
[02:14:47.634 --> 02:14:48.374]  I like Steve.
[02:14:49.675 --> 02:14:52.056]  I think my worldview is probably closer to his.
[02:14:52.657 --> 02:14:56.879]  But on the key issues, on the key fights, he just hasn't weighed in.
[02:14:57.319 --> 02:14:58.660]  He's been a bit of a disappointment.
[02:14:59.238 --> 02:14:59.839]  Lee, your take?
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:02.942]  Well, first off, hey Roger, great to see you.
[02:15:02.962 --> 02:15:05.364]  Great to be here.
[02:15:05.584 --> 02:15:10.569]  My view is that when you go up against the establishment, it's very difficult.
[02:15:10.989 --> 02:15:15.614]  And I think Bannon was trying to, you gotta remember, Bannon's got a military background, right?
[02:15:15.954 --> 02:15:17.616]  He's used to chain of command.
[02:15:18.397 --> 02:15:23.762]  And I think the big danger here, and I tweeted this at the President today.
[02:15:24.545 --> 02:15:26.227]  He doesn't know who his real enemies are.
[02:15:26.307 --> 02:15:30.311]  Look, there's three things about Trump that you don't need to be a psychologist to figure out.
[02:15:30.671 --> 02:15:31.912]  He likes being flattered.
[02:15:32.373 --> 02:15:35.096]  If you punch at him, he punches back twice as hard.
[02:15:35.436 --> 02:15:36.497]  And he loves his family.
[02:15:36.577 --> 02:15:39.240]  I believe Donald Trump genuinely loves his family.
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:41.542]  So they figured out how to get to him.
[02:15:41.562 --> 02:15:44.004]  And they got to him through his liberal daughter.
[02:15:44.605 --> 02:15:46.407]  Ivanka Trump is a New York liberal.
[02:15:47.262 --> 02:15:47.682]  The end.
[02:15:47.962 --> 02:15:53.884]  Her friends are Chelsea Clinton and Huma Abedin, someone Roger and I have written about extensively before.
[02:15:54.284 --> 02:15:57.325]  When your friends Huma Abedin, there's a real problem.
[02:15:57.705 --> 02:16:08.608]  And they got to Ivanka at a party that was thrown at Wendy Murdoch's house right in January, where they had Mika Brzezinski and all these other people who hate Donald Trump.
[02:16:09.008 --> 02:16:11.389]  And I think Donald Trump has been suckered in
[02:16:12.344 --> 02:16:12.944]  How do you get?
[02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:14.165]  I've learned this, Roger.
[02:16:14.205 --> 02:16:16.666]  You've worked on many political campaigns, more than I have.
[02:16:17.086 --> 02:16:31.953]  But one of the things that I've learned from my work in politics is no matter how smart you are as an outside consultant, at the end of the day, that candidate answers to their wife, their family and the guy they went to college with.
[02:16:32.833 --> 02:16:34.334]  And it's so frustrating.
[02:16:34.514 --> 02:16:38.756]  And I'm sure you've seen this, Roger, where you give good advice to a candidate.
[02:16:39.645 --> 02:16:49.272]  And they ignore it because their wife or their daughter or their friend who they grew up with is like, hey, I don't know if you really want to take that position.
[02:16:50.053 --> 02:16:51.854]  And so I think Bannon suffered from that.
[02:16:51.894 --> 02:16:57.538]  I got to say, I liked everything Steve said in that interview that came out in The American Spectator.
[02:16:57.558 --> 02:16:58.639]  I liked everything he said.
[02:17:00.126 --> 02:17:05.190]  I don't disagree with that, and I wouldn't expect him to have a perfect batting record.
[02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:08.232]  The problem is that many, many times he just never went to bat.
[02:17:08.792 --> 02:17:16.718]  So his supporters out today saying, well, now the White House is completely populated with New York Democrats.
[02:17:17.378 --> 02:17:17.658]  True.
[02:17:17.678 --> 02:17:24.085]  That's because Steve wouldn't help anybody else who was for Donald Trump get hired in the Trump administration.
[02:17:24.605 --> 02:17:31.873]  Now to suddenly complain that you're alone is like murdering your parents and then throwing yourself on the mercy of the court because you're an orphan.
[02:17:33.727 --> 02:17:40.949]  In this case, he did not help any allies, not in the departments, not in the cabinet jobs, not in the White House.
[02:17:41.490 --> 02:17:44.631]  There aren't many Trump supporters in the Trump administration.
[02:17:45.051 --> 02:17:53.233]  Fine men like David Urban or Ed Martin couldn't get a hand up to try to get into the administration to help.
[02:17:53.293 --> 02:17:54.714]  These are experienced people.
[02:17:54.754 --> 02:17:55.694]  These aren't lightweights.
[02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:57.054]  These are political heavyweights.
[02:17:57.555 --> 02:18:01.496]  People who played a key role in the election of Donald Trump.
[02:18:02.136 --> 02:18:03.978]  Couldn't get the time of day from Steve Bannon.
[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:10.627]  Yeah, no, look, I've said that I have not personally heard from Steve since June 27th.
[02:18:11.107 --> 02:18:16.474]  When I had a medical issue, I reached out to Steve, told him about it, and he sent back a note on that.
[02:18:18.036 --> 02:18:19.859]  I know other people who've said,
[02:18:20.931 --> 02:18:27.273]  That well, you may know some of them too, Roger, that Steve wants to avoid this Russia issue.
[02:18:28.173 --> 02:18:29.274]  And I work for Sputnik.
[02:18:29.314 --> 02:18:32.515]  I host a radio show on Sputnik because they let me say what I want.
[02:18:32.775 --> 02:18:34.255]  They don't restrict me in any way.
[02:18:34.335 --> 02:18:35.436]  And it's a great platform.
[02:18:36.949 --> 02:18:37.149]  Well,
[02:18:58.268 --> 02:19:08.334]  Andy, if you're going to limit yourself to talking only... If you can't talk to people who are under investigation in the Russia matter, then you can't talk to the President of the United States.
[02:19:08.994 --> 02:19:10.755]  The investigation's a fraud.
[02:19:10.815 --> 02:19:12.376]  It's been a fraud from the beginning.
[02:19:12.836 --> 02:19:13.217]  That's right.
[02:19:13.337 --> 02:19:15.218]  Russian collusion, delusion.
[02:19:15.918 --> 02:19:22.845]  One of the main reasons why I wanted to get you on today is because there was collusion with a foreign country.
[02:19:22.885 --> 02:19:25.487]  There was interference in our elections.
[02:19:25.988 --> 02:19:31.773]  There was a presidential candidate working with the foreign power to affect the outcome of the election.
[02:19:31.833 --> 02:19:35.456]  Unfortunately for the left, it's not Russia, it's Ukraine.
[02:19:38.719 --> 02:19:52.950]  The whole Manafort drama, which we need to get into today, backs into this, and you told me some amazing things the other day that I think our listeners need to learn about the level intensity of the Ukrainian effort to subvert our election.
[02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:53.570]  It's amazing!
[02:19:53.630 --> 02:20:00.315]  Lee Stranahan breaks the news of the Ukrainian Democrat collusion, and then all of a sudden the Russia narrative just disappears from the mainstream news every day.
[02:20:00.535 --> 02:20:00.935]  Interesting.
[02:20:00.955 --> 02:20:02.677]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone and Lee Stranahan.
[02:20:04.268 --> 02:20:06.210]  Super blue mouthwash is here.
[02:20:06.390 --> 02:20:13.158]  We have 50% off out of the gates because I want you to try these products when you get it in the silver special.
[02:20:13.819 --> 02:20:24.090]  You get the electric toothbrush, silver impregnated, the super blue mouthwash, the colloidal silver, the super blue toothpaste and all of it 50% off or get it by itself at what 11% off.
[02:20:25.151 --> 02:20:31.273]  It's 1776, part of the 1776 special, but whatever you do, support the broadcast, commit to do it today.
[02:20:31.613 --> 02:20:34.094]  It is an act of rebellion to fund us.
[02:20:34.234 --> 02:20:46.339]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[02:20:46.539 --> 02:20:53.921]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWars Life family, True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life.
[02:20:54.242 --> 02:21:00.164]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high quality organic conditions.
[02:21:00.744 --> 02:21:04.325]  Our True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life contains a whopping
[02:21:05.125 --> 02:21:07.467]  20 grams of protein per serving.
[02:21:07.928 --> 02:21:15.134]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[02:21:15.294 --> 02:21:27.985]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies to bring you a super high quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[02:21:28.465 --> 02:21:29.827]  That way you get the benefits

[02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:38.870]  Doing our research, one thing continued to really stand out.
[02:21:39.410 --> 02:21:48.073]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass fed.
[02:21:48.473 --> 02:21:49.313]  That is essential.
[02:21:49.673 --> 02:21:53.955]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass fed, happy cows.
[02:21:54.455 --> 02:21:56.877]  This is the very best way that we were able to bring to market.
[02:21:57.257 --> 02:21:58.979]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.

[02:24:12.293 --> 02:24:15.959]  Owen Troyer, Roger Stone, Lee Stranahan, Jedi Council here.
[02:24:15.979 --> 02:24:20.427]  We're going to get into the real collusion between the Democrats and Hillary Clinton.
[02:24:20.828 --> 02:24:22.430]  Lee Stranahan has been reporting on that.
[02:24:22.531 --> 02:24:24.454]  Roger wants to get into some of those details.
[02:24:24.514 --> 02:24:25.556]  I pitch it now to Roger Stone.
[02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:45.948]  Lee, when Paul Manafort joined the Trump campaign, really at the end of a string of primaries, as we were moving towards the convention, it became very clear that the Republican establishment both could and would try to steal the nomination from the presumptive nominee.
[02:24:46.548 --> 02:24:55.516]  Because the Republican National Convention is governed by, not federal law or state law, by its own rules, we have a historical precedent.
[02:24:55.636 --> 02:25:01.481]  In 1952, the nomination was stolen from Robert Taft and awarded to General Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[02:25:02.162 --> 02:25:13.632]  So the hire of Manafort struck fear in the hearts not only of the establishment Republicans, but more so, Hillary and her friends went into overdrive looking for dirt
[02:25:14.372 --> 02:25:23.195]  I think when they couldn't find any, they sought to manufacture some because Manafort's reputation as a political gunfighter was very solid.
[02:25:23.255 --> 02:25:26.056]  This is a guy who knows how to run a national campaign.
[02:25:26.776 --> 02:25:38.920]  And to his credit, I think he was seminal in Trump's nomination in preparation for the general election in terms of building a structure that could function during a general election campaign.
[02:25:40.101 --> 02:25:55.215]  At the time that the news broke regarding supposedly illicit payments to Manafort from a democratically elected or democratically recognized political party in Ukraine, I immediately smelled a rat.
[02:25:56.537 --> 02:26:08.928]  And this became a concerted effort to drive Manafort out of the Trump campaign, really at the behest of the Clinton Democrats who feared his leadership and his assistance to Trump.
[02:26:09.489 --> 02:26:19.638]  You have now done yeoman research on the backstory of the entire Ukrainian effort to affect the American elections, and that's what I wanted to talk about today.
[02:26:20.639 --> 02:26:21.580]  What happened here, Lee?
[02:26:22.369 --> 02:26:23.790]  That's real significant.
[02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:24.851]  And a couple things.
[02:26:25.011 --> 02:26:32.297]  I was at the press conference where Ted Cruz in Texas basically announced that he was going to fight this.
[02:26:32.697 --> 02:26:39.382]  He realized, remember, there was a point in the election where he realized he couldn't win on the popular vote.
[02:26:39.422 --> 02:26:41.664]  So he started pursuing a delegate strategy.
[02:26:41.724 --> 02:26:41.944]  Right.
[02:26:42.244 --> 02:26:44.065]  And that's the point they brought Manafort in.
[02:26:44.546 --> 02:26:45.707]  And he was a great hire.
[02:26:45.767 --> 02:26:48.469]  Now, as you mentioned, in mid August,
[02:26:49.472 --> 02:26:55.557]  Stories started to come out in the New York Times, Washington Post, Reuters, every major news outlet.
[02:26:55.917 --> 02:27:07.347]  They found a secret ledger in Ukraine, and a prosecutor says Paul Manafort was receiving cash payments in this secret ledger, also called a black ledger, in the Ukraine, okay?
[02:27:07.787 --> 02:27:13.972]  Now, let's cut to June 27th of this year, after the election.
[02:27:14.972 --> 02:27:23.294]  The same prosecutor who announced that secret ledger comes out and says, lo and behold, oops, no, Manafort's name is not in it.
[02:27:23.895 --> 02:27:25.115]  There were no cash payments.
[02:27:25.175 --> 02:27:26.055]  That's what he said.
[02:27:26.495 --> 02:27:29.216]  Now, how many media outlets do you think reported that?
[02:27:29.236 --> 02:27:30.417]  The Times, the Post?
[02:27:30.497 --> 02:27:30.937]  Nobody.
[02:27:31.317 --> 02:27:31.757]  Nobody.
[02:27:32.837 --> 02:27:35.958]  Bloomberg is the only people I found who reported it.
[02:27:36.398 --> 02:27:37.699]  CNN mentioned it.
[02:27:38.219 --> 02:27:38.719]  Literally,
[02:27:39.548 --> 02:27:44.351]  At the bottom paragraph, the last paragraph of the story, attacking Manafort.
[02:27:44.832 --> 02:27:45.192]  Okay?
[02:27:45.452 --> 02:27:55.739]  Now, anybody who looks into this... Now, by the way, the other thing you would assume from this Trump-Russia narrative is that Paul Manafort, he's Russia-connected.
[02:27:55.779 --> 02:27:56.680]  He's Russia-connected.
[02:27:57.373 --> 02:28:07.055]  It's very clear Manafort was actually giving Yanukovych, the president of the Ukraine, advice to move away from Russia, to move towards the EU.
[02:28:07.375 --> 02:28:10.776]  It's exactly the opposite of what the media is portraying, right?
[02:28:10.896 --> 02:28:20.579]  So, the fact that they reported the secret ledger but they didn't report the retraction by the same person was significant.
[02:28:20.739 --> 02:28:25.980]  Then, because I've been reporting on this, I was contacted by a source
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:31.961]  As close to this as you can possibly get in the Ukraine.
[02:28:33.762 --> 02:28:40.403]  And they sent me information about a investigation that had been opened in the Ukraine.
[02:28:40.583 --> 02:28:42.444]  I reported this two weeks ago.
[02:28:43.224 --> 02:28:43.904]  Very important.
[02:28:43.964 --> 02:28:48.065]  I reported this two weeks ago, and I showed the material to other people.
[02:28:49.119 --> 02:28:52.401]  Because I wanted to put a flag in the ground that I did it.
[02:28:52.421 --> 02:28:53.622]  I didn't want to burn the source.
[02:28:54.182 --> 02:28:57.184]  Now, just a couple of days ago, it's confirmed what I said.
[02:28:57.464 --> 02:29:03.868]  You'll notice these stories indicate that the investigation was opened on August 1st.
[02:29:04.848 --> 02:29:10.572]  Okay, this part, the story came out in Politico a couple days ago, this story here, and the caller one.
[02:29:10.932 --> 02:29:12.453]  They say that Apollo members
[02:29:13.678 --> 02:29:15.099]  Demanding more information.
[02:29:15.460 --> 02:29:20.584]  If you dig down into the story, you'll see the investigation was actually started on August 1st.
[02:29:20.785 --> 02:29:22.947]  So, that takes us to that.
[02:29:24.168 --> 02:29:26.110]  This is election interference.
[02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:27.451]  It was a false story.
[02:29:27.511 --> 02:29:28.752]  They've now retracted it.
[02:29:29.192 --> 02:29:36.099]  And the rest of the story involves how the DNC was directly involved, I think illegally, in doing this.
[02:29:37.014 --> 02:29:39.636]  So, the Clintons get to collude with Ukraine.
[02:29:39.916 --> 02:29:42.498]  The Clintons get to try to impact elections all around the world.
[02:29:42.818 --> 02:29:46.321]  The Clintons get to have all this hush money and all these foundations.
[02:29:47.042 --> 02:29:47.702]  But it's Trump.
[02:29:48.062 --> 02:29:49.423]  Trump's not allowed to say anything.
[02:29:49.463 --> 02:29:50.504]  Trump's not allowed to do anything.
[02:29:50.544 --> 02:29:53.366]  Trump is the one colluding with Russia, even though there's no evidence.
[02:29:54.007 --> 02:29:55.608]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.549 --> 02:29:59.211]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.133 --> 02:30:13.337]  Ruthless offshore elites use their corporate liberal media to attack and demonize any Americans or any independent news that dare challenge their lives.
[02:30:13.957 --> 02:30:17.139]  Five companies own over 90% of the media.
[02:30:17.559 --> 02:30:24.002]  And that's why whether it's comedy shows, award shows, Hollywood, TV entertainment, the news, it doesn't matter.
[02:30:24.022 --> 02:30:32.386]  It's all focused in one anti-American, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-gun voice.
[02:30:33.166 --> 02:30:33.906]  And it gets worse.
[02:30:34.266 --> 02:30:45.430]  These ruthless social engineers have an iron grip on our educational system and are teaching our children to hate America and that our president is worse than Hitler and needs to be assassinated.
[02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:52.893]  But as America reawakens, these powerful, deep state, rogue government forces are beginning to panic.
[02:30:53.593 --> 02:31:05.938]  They've even got the former president on television and in the news, and traveling to foreign countries, bad-mouthing America, bad-mouthing sovereignty, and calling for resistance to our elected president.
[02:31:06.438 --> 02:31:18.323]  In a last-ditch effort, mainstream media is now legitimizing the use of violence against anyone that opposes the globalist takeover, and against anyone who's actually trying to make this nation great again.
[02:31:18.863 --> 02:31:31.169]  They are absolutely intensifying their efforts, screaming homophobe, xenophobe, racist, to make them march, to make them go out on the streets and assault viciously anyone trying to exercise their free speech.
[02:31:31.690 --> 02:31:39.494]  International criminals like George Soros are openly pushing for civil insurrection in America that will lead to civil war.
[02:31:40.134 --> 02:31:46.877]  The beatings, the stabbings, the shootings, the burning cars, the looting of shops, the execution of police officers.
[02:31:47.497 --> 02:31:57.682]  All of this leads to the destabilization, to the martial law that the deep state and the globalists say they need to bring in their final takeover of America.
[02:31:58.382 --> 02:32:02.604]  We are America, and we are the Infowar.
[02:32:04.306 --> 02:32:07.831]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[02:32:08.292 --> 02:32:14.340]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:17.544]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:17.925 --> 02:32:20.909]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:32:21.129 --> 02:32:24.552]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[02:32:24.892 --> 02:32:26.654]  The left controls culture.
[02:32:26.674 --> 02:32:27.655]  They control arts.
[02:32:27.735 --> 02:32:28.956]  They control entertainment.
[02:32:29.256 --> 02:32:36.343]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:32:36.383 --> 02:32:38.805]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[02:32:39.285 --> 02:32:43.149]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:32:43.209 --> 02:32:45.271]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[02:32:45.891 --> 02:32:51.255]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[02:32:51.515 --> 02:32:57.760]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[02:32:57.840 --> 02:32:59.542]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[02:32:59.682 --> 02:33:00.863]  It's available right now.
[02:33:01.183 --> 02:33:03.385]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[02:33:21.021 --> 02:33:21.762]  Big Brother.
[02:33:22.203 --> 02:33:23.445]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:24.006 --> 02:33:25.910]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:25.930 --> 02:33:27.312]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:27.573 --> 02:33:28.735]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:29.256 --> 02:33:33.824]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.114 --> 02:33:40.439]  So the Clintons literally get to get away with everything, colluding with Russia, colluding with Ukraine.
[02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:44.964]  Hillary Clinton gets to say black people are predators and need to be brought to heel.
[02:33:45.184 --> 02:33:50.830]  Clintons just get away with everything, and then they use their attack dogs in the mainstream media to go after Trump.
[02:33:51.130 --> 02:33:53.713]  Now, Lee Stranahan, we've got seven minutes left with you.
[02:33:53.773 --> 02:33:57.297]  Let's get a boil down of everything we were just getting into with Roger Stone.
[02:33:58.097 --> 02:33:59.018]  Well, yeah, sure.
[02:33:59.038 --> 02:34:04.563]  The big thing here to look at, there was a Politico article back in January that started to outline this.
[02:34:05.044 --> 02:34:11.289]  And that Politico article points out that there's a DNC operative named Alexandra Chalupa.
[02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:13.391]  She worked in the Clinton White House.
[02:34:13.411 --> 02:34:15.013]  She was a DNC operative from 2004 to 2016.
[02:34:15.333 --> 02:34:17.015]  And she's the one who met with the Ukrainians.
[02:34:17.055 --> 02:34:17.956]  Not only that,
[02:34:21.739 --> 02:34:29.964]  She also met with a group of journalists, Ukrainian journalists, at something called the Open World Leadership Center.
[02:34:30.885 --> 02:34:33.866]  This is significant because this is not legal.
[02:34:33.906 --> 02:34:38.569]  The Open World Leadership Center is a branch, it's part of the Library of Congress.
[02:34:38.929 --> 02:34:41.711]  It's supposed to, by statute, be nonpartisan.
[02:34:42.331 --> 02:34:44.393]  She was using it for partisan purposes.
[02:34:44.773 --> 02:34:49.916]  Now, the other thing that I want to point out, and this is a story that was also reported that relates,
[02:34:51.082 --> 02:34:59.327]  After the election, so Donald Trump's elected in November, Alexander Chalupa works with a guy named Brett Kimberlin.
[02:34:59.367 --> 02:35:01.448]  Brett Kimberlin's a convicted bomber.
[02:35:02.889 --> 02:35:16.137]  He bombed, lit off five or six bombs, I forget the exact number, in Indiana in the late 70s, early 80s, to cover up an investigation into a murder he was being investigated for.
[02:35:16.758 --> 02:35:19.039]  So he goes into prison, he gets out of prison,
[02:35:21.278 --> 02:35:23.560]  And he becomes a Democrat activist.
[02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:25.161]  He becomes a liberal activist.
[02:35:25.521 --> 02:35:27.863]  He starts a group called Justice Through Music Project.
[02:35:27.903 --> 02:35:31.566]  He starts a group called Velvet Revolution.
[02:35:32.647 --> 02:35:36.229]  And he does a lot of work in Ukraine when he gets out of business.
[02:35:36.269 --> 02:35:41.774]  He eventually marries someone who's Ukrainian, who he met when she was 14, by the way.
[02:35:42.154 --> 02:35:43.315]  I should point that out as well.
[02:35:44.409 --> 02:35:45.570]  Why do I mention this guy?
[02:35:45.610 --> 02:36:02.440]  Because Alexander Chalupa, the DNC operative, used Brett Kimberlin as the bag man to pay a foreign national to fly to this country and to meet with Democrat leaders where they discussed how to keep Trump from taking office.
[02:36:02.961 --> 02:36:06.783]  Now, this was reported later, ironically enough, by BuzzFeed.
[02:36:07.183 --> 02:36:11.446]  They didn't mention Chalupa's name, but they did mention
[02:36:13.064 --> 02:36:18.987]  Uh, all the events, and then the Daily Caller, uh, followed up and said it was Alexander Chalupa.
[02:36:19.107 --> 02:36:23.729]  I have subsequently interviewed witnesses who confirm every aspect of this story.
[02:36:24.169 --> 02:36:32.053]  The Democrats are, in my opinion, clearly money laundering here, and an investigation needs to be called.
[02:36:32.093 --> 02:36:38.916]  Now, by the way, the two guys to watch on this are Chuck Grassley and Steve King, both from Iowa.
[02:36:39.877 --> 02:36:41.938]  Uh, Grassley- Senate Judiciary Committee.
[02:36:42.875 --> 02:36:47.637]  Well yeah, and Grassley's pointed out the Ukrainian connection, and so has King.
[02:36:48.257 --> 02:36:57.721]  This is a story, and I'll put it like this, you just showed, Politico said, the Ukrainian government is looking into DNC collusion.
[02:36:59.381 --> 02:37:00.322]  Try to Google that.
[02:37:00.542 --> 02:37:06.784]  Anybody, use Google, use DuckDuckGo, no, the New York Times, the Post, nothing.
[02:37:07.224 --> 02:37:07.805]  Nothing at all.
[02:37:07.845 --> 02:37:10.906]  Now you said, Owen, correctly, that
[02:37:12.384 --> 02:37:14.226]  The Democrats can get away with this.
[02:37:14.306 --> 02:37:15.567]  Why can they get away with this?
[02:37:16.587 --> 02:37:20.931]  We have to realize that we're fighting an asymmetrical information war here, right?
[02:37:21.491 --> 02:37:30.358]  They control the mainstream media, the established media, including Fox, and they do this through repetition.
[02:37:30.699 --> 02:37:33.581]  If they talk about a story every day, they smeared Roger.
[02:37:34.041 --> 02:37:35.683]  I know the details of that story.
[02:37:36.003 --> 02:37:39.786]  All I have to do is say Roger Stone colluded with the Russians.
[02:37:40.566 --> 02:37:46.118]  People see the headline, they don't read that he dealt with somebody who's never been proven to be Russian.
[02:37:47.552 --> 02:37:52.195]  After a month and a half after the hack, they never point that out.
[02:37:52.476 --> 02:38:00.641]  So we need to fight the information war here asymmetrically and realize, look, the founding fathers beat the Redcoats.
[02:38:00.922 --> 02:38:01.722]  Does that make sense?
[02:38:02.042 --> 02:38:07.066]  And the way they did it was not trying to to fight them one on one.
[02:38:07.086 --> 02:38:12.710]  And that's one of the reasons I'm actually glad Bannon's out of the White House, actually, because I hope he speaks.
[02:38:12.730 --> 02:38:14.271]  I hope he starts speaking up again.
[02:38:14.311 --> 02:38:15.592]  I think he he will.
[02:38:15.632 --> 02:38:16.973]  You know, Steve is a brawler.
[02:38:17.593 --> 02:38:19.654]  And I agree with Roger.
[02:38:19.674 --> 02:38:22.855]  Steve has not demonstrated that since he's been in the White House.
[02:38:23.215 --> 02:38:24.415]  And I hope that comes out.
[02:38:24.736 --> 02:38:27.917]  But again, God bless you, you know, Roger.
[02:38:27.977 --> 02:38:33.178]  God bless you here at InfoWars for fighting this information war in an asymmetrical way.
[02:38:33.519 --> 02:38:34.619]  That's the only way to do it.
[02:38:34.819 --> 02:38:41.061]  But all people have to do to get red-pilled on this is look up what they tell you and what they don't tell you.
[02:38:41.401 --> 02:38:42.522]  They print the story.
[02:38:42.582 --> 02:38:43.942]  They don't print the retraction.
[02:38:44.182 --> 02:38:45.283]  It's stunning, actually.
[02:38:45.303 --> 02:38:46.063]  It's very stunning.
[02:38:46.423 --> 02:39:00.599]  Well, what's really significant here, I think, is that the Ukrainian connection and the Ukrainian collusion to assist Hillary has to be viewed now in light of the information that the Ukrainians have supplied missile technology
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:05.724]  To the North Koreans to make their missiles more viable and more accurate.
[02:39:06.304 --> 02:39:08.666]  This puts the whole thing in an entirely new light.
[02:39:08.726 --> 02:39:22.937]  The other question I get constantly that I want to address is about the raid at Manafort's home on the 26th of last month by the FBI, where they kicked in the front door, then they kicked in the door of the bedroom where he was sleeping with his wife.
[02:39:24.078 --> 02:39:26.079]  The purpose of this raid was intimidation.
[02:39:26.159 --> 02:39:28.119]  They are trying to squeeze Manafort.
[02:39:28.159 --> 02:39:31.961]  They want him to bear false witness against the president.
[02:39:32.121 --> 02:39:37.542]  Mueller wants him to testify that, yes, I colluded with the Russians, and yes, Trump knew everything.
[02:39:38.503 --> 02:39:41.144]  I know Paul Manafort 45 years.
[02:39:41.764 --> 02:39:44.445]  That is never going to happen.
[02:39:44.865 --> 02:39:45.245]  Never.
[02:39:45.605 --> 02:39:48.106]  They want him to lie, and he won't lie.
[02:39:49.106 --> 02:39:50.547]  But that's what that was all about.
[02:39:50.567 --> 02:39:58.593]  This is the heavy, oppressive hand of Mr. Mueller in the kind of tactic that you use on drug dealers, not political operatives.
[02:39:58.933 --> 02:39:59.734]  Let me go further.
[02:39:59.774 --> 02:40:02.596]  Here's another story that you probably know about, Roger.
[02:40:02.796 --> 02:40:04.477]  It's been completely not covered.
[02:40:04.758 --> 02:40:06.419]  Do you know about the blackmail claim?
[02:40:06.439 --> 02:40:08.921]  And do you know about the hacking of Manafort's daughter, Jess?
[02:40:08.941 --> 02:40:09.021]  Yes.
[02:40:09.181 --> 02:40:09.961]  Do you know about that?
[02:40:10.021 --> 02:40:10.262]  Yes.
[02:40:11.102 --> 02:40:12.422]  That's a major story.
[02:40:12.462 --> 02:40:14.243]  And by the way, who was attacking him?
[02:40:14.683 --> 02:40:15.323]  Ukrainians.
[02:40:15.763 --> 02:40:19.383]  The same guy who supplied that ledger, Leshchenko.
[02:40:20.064 --> 02:40:21.604]  He's a Ukrainian politician.
[02:40:22.604 --> 02:40:30.165]  He's the one who Manafort had, I think, filed a suit against and filed a police report against, saying, this person's trying to blackmail me.
[02:40:30.485 --> 02:40:33.026]  And Paul Manafort's daughter was hacked.
[02:40:33.146 --> 02:40:35.606]  You never hear that in the news, right?
[02:40:36.266 --> 02:40:36.947]  He was hacked.
[02:40:37.167 --> 02:40:39.487]  So it's not just government intimidation.
[02:40:40.521 --> 02:40:45.982]  It's black ops intimidation and literal hacking of his daughter.
[02:40:46.362 --> 02:40:51.804]  Now, the other thing that's interesting is they never print Manafort.
[02:40:52.204 --> 02:40:58.345]  Again, Manafort, I'll tell you the best article, as you as you well know, Paul Manafort's father was the mayor of New Britain, Connecticut.
[02:40:59.385 --> 02:41:01.866]  I was doing some research in Connecticut newspapers.
[02:41:03.006 --> 02:41:09.848]  It was either the Hartford Courant or the New Britain paper had the longest quote I've ever read in the media from Manafort, and he lays out
[02:41:10.655 --> 02:41:17.698]  Now, he was urging Yanukovych to move towards the EU, not to move towards Russia.
[02:41:18.038 --> 02:41:30.103]  The recent Washington Post story shows that when people were trying to set up meetings between Trump and the Russians, if they were trying to do that, if they were suggesting it, who was coming out against it?
[02:41:30.283 --> 02:41:31.944]  Even the Washington Post admits that.
[02:41:32.546 --> 02:41:33.646]  Paul Manafort, right?
[02:41:34.287 --> 02:41:36.327]  This is a complete smear job.
[02:41:36.407 --> 02:41:37.668]  I don't know Manafort at all.
[02:41:37.708 --> 02:41:39.508]  I've never spoken to him at all.
[02:41:39.888 --> 02:41:42.429]  But just as a researcher, it's a complete smear.
[02:41:42.769 --> 02:41:46.790]  The other thing that's really significant is what I've been reporting this week about Charlottesville.
[02:41:47.371 --> 02:41:58.394]  Charlottesville, if you just look up Ukraine torch march, you'll find exact duplicates of what we saw in Charlottesville in Ukraine in 2013.
[02:41:58.694 --> 02:41:59.654]  And here's something else.
[02:42:00.095 --> 02:42:01.435]  I don't know if you know this, Roger.
[02:42:02.108 --> 02:42:07.190]  David Duke, the white supremacist who was at Charlottesville, he is a doctorate, right?
[02:42:07.210 --> 02:42:08.811]  He calls himself Dr. David Duke.
[02:42:09.071 --> 02:42:14.753]  Do you have any idea where David Duke, if you had a guess, what country he might have gotten that from?
[02:42:15.313 --> 02:42:17.614]  The island of Island State University?
[02:42:18.374 --> 02:42:20.355]  No, no, it's Ukraine, but you can guess.
[02:42:21.286 --> 02:42:21.947]  It's Ukraine.
[02:42:22.267 --> 02:42:22.708]  Look it up.
[02:42:22.748 --> 02:42:24.469]  Just look up David Duke Ukraine.
[02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:26.371]  He's got extensive connections.
[02:42:26.872 --> 02:42:40.346]  What happened in the Ukrainian coup is the United States, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John McCain, the CIA and the media, we overthrew and all funded by George Soros.
[02:42:41.118 --> 02:42:46.003]  We overthrew the government of the Ukraine and put in literal neo-Nazis.
[02:42:46.623 --> 02:42:52.509]  Anyone can look up S-V-O-B as in boy, O-D-A, Svoboda.
[02:42:52.889 --> 02:42:54.451]  Svoboda, there you go, right there.
[02:42:54.911 --> 02:42:58.995]  That's from David Duke's own site, bragging about his Ukrainian connections.
[02:42:59.395 --> 02:43:05.041]  So when I started to notice this, and I started to notice, could you go back to the picture of the torch march?
[02:43:05.601 --> 02:43:07.862]  For a second, go back to the last picture if you can.
[02:43:08.022 --> 02:43:08.403]  There you go.
[02:43:08.463 --> 02:43:11.144]  See those flags there with the red and black on them?
[02:43:12.625 --> 02:43:17.707]  That's the flag of the Ukrainian insurgent army who killed, these are actual Nazi collaborators.
[02:43:18.228 --> 02:43:22.990]  In World War II, they killed 60,000 Jews and Poles, okay?
[02:43:23.390 --> 02:43:26.172]  That flag is the blood and soil flag.
[02:43:26.532 --> 02:43:30.534]  The top red stripe is for blood, the bottom is for soil.
[02:43:31.654 --> 02:43:32.675]  In Charlottesville,
[02:43:33.709 --> 02:43:39.871]  The guy who crashed the car into people can be seen walking down the street chanting blood and soil.
[02:43:39.891 --> 02:43:43.332]  So when I started to notice this, this is what they're trying to do.
[02:43:43.392 --> 02:43:44.672]  I'll give it to you real quickly.
[02:43:44.932 --> 02:43:46.473]  They want to gin up a race war.
[02:43:48.194 --> 02:43:50.154]  They want to gin it up from both sides.
[02:43:50.894 --> 02:43:53.475]  And then they want to use that for a literal coup.
[02:43:54.055 --> 02:43:56.596]  If they can't get the coup, they'll take impeachment.
[02:43:57.016 --> 02:43:59.277]  If they can't get the impeachment, they'll take
[02:44:00.777 --> 02:44:03.840]  Just an electoral victory, destroying Trump electorally.
[02:44:04.521 --> 02:44:24.421]  But mark my words, this is their goal, and they're going to do it by getting these... I'm not a conspiracy theorist, anybody who knows my journalism, but if ever there is a false flag operation investigation required, it's this situation in Charlottesville that the media jumped on.
[02:44:25.020 --> 02:44:29.403]  And the DOJ is apparently investigating more into this, you guys.
[02:44:29.724 --> 02:44:32.666]  Thank you so much, Lee Stranahan, for breaking all this down.
[02:44:33.046 --> 02:44:40.332]  Check out his website, thepopulist.us, and the CJS, doesn't stand for Conspiracy Journalism School, Citizen Journalism School.
[02:44:40.572 --> 02:44:41.353]  Thank you so much, Lee.
[02:44:41.673 --> 02:44:42.193]  Thank you.
[02:45:11.773 --> 02:45:18.604]  Breaking news just happened yesterday, clearly an attempt to stop a new independent social media from forming.
[02:45:18.844 --> 02:45:22.670]  We're now joined by Andrew Torba, the creator of Gab.
[02:45:23.111 --> 02:45:24.413]  Andrew, were you expecting this?
[02:45:24.433 --> 02:45:25.454]  Did you see this coming?
[02:45:25.775 --> 02:45:26.396]  What happened here?
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:28.521]  Well, no, we didn't.
[02:45:28.581 --> 02:45:35.929]  We've actually been on Google's Play Store for a number of months now, and we had no inclination that this was coming.
[02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:39.794]  We knew it was always a possibility, but it just came out of nowhere.
[02:45:39.854 --> 02:45:42.317]  They said, goodbye, you're off the App Store, have fun.
[02:45:42.757 --> 02:45:42.977]  Uh-huh.
[02:46:09.738 --> 02:46:12.181]  Well, Andrew, first of all, I really dig your pajamas.
[02:46:13.263 --> 02:46:14.244]  I hope we didn't wake you up.
[02:46:15.185 --> 02:46:17.448]  Just kidding.
[02:46:17.468 --> 02:46:23.136]  This comes in the wake of the extraordinary news that Diamond and Silk
[02:46:24.077 --> 02:46:25.458]  We're taking off of YouTube.
[02:46:25.579 --> 02:46:28.861]  One of the most popular outspoken supporters of Donald Trump.
[02:46:28.941 --> 02:46:29.782]  I love those women.
[02:46:29.842 --> 02:46:30.963]  I think they're very funny.
[02:46:30.983 --> 02:46:33.865]  I think they're very effective in getting their message across.
[02:46:33.945 --> 02:46:38.629]  Now they're harassing Gab, where I'm a proud participant.
[02:46:39.090 --> 02:46:41.252]  This is part and parcel of an effort.
[02:46:42.212 --> 02:46:49.099]  That should be addressed by the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust in the Trump administration.
[02:46:49.780 --> 02:46:51.542]  Except for that job is vacant.
[02:46:52.863 --> 02:46:57.027]  And unfortunately Steve Bannon made no effort to fill that job.
[02:46:57.568 --> 02:47:04.495]  We don't even know when the job is filled that the person, man or woman, who fills it will be copacetic with this mission.
[02:47:05.095 --> 02:47:13.170]  But they should be because the rise of a vibrant, robust, alternative media is what allows for the election of Donald Trump.
[02:47:13.691 --> 02:47:16.235]  I'm just curious, Andrew, did they give an example of hate speech?
[02:47:17.324 --> 02:47:22.305]  No, we got no examples, we got no, you know, screenshots or, you know, here, this user said this.
[02:47:23.165 --> 02:47:24.926]  And actually, Roger, I completely agree.
[02:47:25.146 --> 02:47:35.968]  And we're in talks right now with Ron Coleman, who famously won the Slant's Supreme Court case, you know, landmark First Amendment, you know, win.
[02:47:36.448 --> 02:47:40.809]  And we're speaking with him, you know, about our options here, because you're absolutely correct.
[02:47:40.849 --> 02:47:42.129]  What we have here is a duopoly.
[02:47:42.549 --> 02:47:42.749]  Right.
[02:47:42.789 --> 02:47:52.074]  You know, between Facebook or between, you know, Apple and Google rather, you know, they own and control 95% of the market for app distribution.
[02:47:52.594 --> 02:47:57.437]  And, you know, not having an app on those stores for, in Apple's case, objectionable content,
[02:47:57.697 --> 02:47:58.498]  Well, hold on a second.
[02:47:58.538 --> 02:48:00.559]  I'm so glad that you brought that up.
[02:48:00.739 --> 02:48:05.222]  One of the top trends on Twitter, I'm not sure if it was yesterday or the day before, was assassinate President Trump.
[02:48:05.242 --> 02:48:06.543]  You have members of our government
[02:48:18.490 --> 02:48:20.853]  Calling for the assassination of Donald Trump.
[02:48:21.334 --> 02:48:27.862]  How is that hate speech allowed on Twitter, on Facebook, but then Gab gets removed with zero examples?
[02:48:28.223 --> 02:48:28.944]  I think we know the answer.
[02:48:29.815 --> 02:48:30.295]  Oh, of course.
[02:48:30.496 --> 02:48:31.336]  Of course we know the answer.
[02:48:31.396 --> 02:48:37.922]  It's a double standard and it's a quintessential example of the ideological echo chamber that exists in Silicon Valley.
[02:48:38.322 --> 02:48:42.526]  The reality is, is that we are a threat to the Silicon Valley robber barons.
[02:48:43.127 --> 02:48:49.172]  Again, we raised a million dollars in about 38 days, 500,000 of which came in in about 24 to 48 hours.
[02:48:49.893 --> 02:48:55.798]  We've openly spoken out against their ideological echo chamber and their biases and double standards towards Trump supporters.
[02:48:56.538 --> 02:49:05.488]  You know, I have friends inside of Facebook, inside of Google, inside of Twitter, who are messaging me and saying, like, I'm fearing for my job, I'm fearing for my livelihood, and it's terrible.
[02:49:05.809 --> 02:49:07.591]  My heart goes out to them for being in this position.
[02:49:07.871 --> 02:49:09.152]  Just like what happened at Google!
[02:49:09.292 --> 02:49:10.474]  Just like what happened at Google!
[02:49:11.238 --> 02:49:11.618]  Exactly.
[02:49:11.658 --> 02:49:19.460]  They're afraid that they're next, but I have a feeling that James Damore will not be the last person to stand up and fight back against this.
[02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:21.821]  I actually had the opportunity to speak with him last night.
[02:49:23.021 --> 02:49:26.262]  We're building an alternative technology alliance here.
[02:49:26.962 --> 02:49:35.485]  If we have to rebuild the entire internet from the ground up, infrastructure, communication, DDoS protection, we will do it.
[02:49:35.805 --> 02:49:39.566]  Whatever it requires, we will do it, and we will plow ahead, and we will win.
[02:49:40.146 --> 02:49:44.890]  We have the people on our side and we have truth and the freedom of expression and liberty on our side.
[02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:47.992]  Well, I don't know if you realize this, Andrew, but you're 100% accurate.
[02:49:48.032 --> 02:49:49.593]  Here's a story from The Guardian today.
[02:49:49.993 --> 02:49:53.375]  Women say they quit Google because of racial discrimination.
[02:49:53.896 --> 02:49:55.357]  I was invisible.
[02:49:56.037 --> 02:50:03.042]  As Google reels from the fallout over a controversial diversity memo, multiple women say they face regular discrimination and ultimately left.
[02:50:03.523 --> 02:50:04.003]  There it is.
[02:50:04.123 --> 02:50:04.824]  Liberal Google.
[02:50:05.204 --> 02:50:05.924]  Women leaving.
[02:50:06.725 --> 02:50:08.766]  People just leaving because they don't get a fair shot.
[02:50:08.786 --> 02:50:09.607]  They don't get a fair say.
[02:50:10.217 --> 02:50:27.283]  This entire issue is why I've affiliated myself with a group called FreeOurInternet.org where they are doing yeoman work pointing out how Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon are running essentially a jihad to shut down free speech and free expression.
[02:50:27.743 --> 02:50:33.885]  See, I think the left understands that the election of Trump would never have been possible
[02:50:35.466 --> 02:50:39.328]  Without the free and mass-based internet.
[02:50:39.829 --> 02:50:42.270]  Now they're trying to get the toothpaste back in the tube.
[02:50:42.871 --> 02:50:46.293]  So the only news you get will be mainstream media.
[02:50:46.333 --> 02:50:49.536]  No gab, no Infowars, no Daily Caller.
[02:50:50.316 --> 02:50:52.558]  And they will fail.
[02:50:52.978 --> 02:50:57.101]  Or they just want to put the cap on the tube so that we can't continue to force this information out there.
[02:50:57.321 --> 02:51:00.363]  One more segment with Andrew Torba and then Roger Stone takes over the fourth hour.
[02:51:00.403 --> 02:51:01.344]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:06.212 --> 02:51:07.594]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:07.614 --> 02:51:14.560]  We're here with Tommy Robinson, author of Enemy of the State, but he also has a new book out, which I think came out today.
[02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:17.383]  So we're already skyrocketing up the charts on Amazon.
[02:51:17.523 --> 02:51:18.484]  Tommy, welcome back.
[02:51:18.624 --> 02:51:18.985]  Hello, Paul.
[02:51:19.005 --> 02:51:19.645]  Thanks for having me.
[02:51:19.826 --> 02:51:20.506]  Good to have you back.
[02:51:20.546 --> 02:51:28.194]  Now, before this unfortunate attack in Hamburg, Germany today, which we don't know the full details of, but it seems to be another Islamic terror attack.
[02:51:28.254 --> 02:51:30.935]  There was this kind of lull, at least in Europe.
[02:51:30.995 --> 02:51:36.177]  The terror attacks seemed to stop all of a sudden, at least for a period of three or four weeks.
[02:51:36.257 --> 02:51:39.938]  The terror attacks appeared to stop when Ramadan ended.
[02:51:40.078 --> 02:51:47.041]  Now, Tommy, surely there's no connection, given we know Islam is a religion of peace and that it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:51:47.241 --> 02:51:54.604]  So why did the terror attacks in Europe suddenly seem to stop when Ramadan ended, given that there's no connection?
[02:51:56.511 --> 02:51:57.594]  We see this every year.
[02:51:57.754 --> 02:51:59.117]  We see it at World War II.
[02:51:59.357 --> 02:52:00.540]  The Ramadan Bomber Fund.
[02:52:06.919 --> 02:52:25.107]  Another thing that they seem not so keen to be reporting on, Tommy, is we had a mob rampage in Liverpool recently, which was, you know, as plain a hate crime as you will ever see.
[02:52:25.527 --> 02:52:27.448]  Numerous people attacked in the street.
[02:52:28.149 --> 02:52:34.911]  We're all supposed to be really concerned about hate crimes in the aftermath of Brexit and in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.
[02:52:35.491 --> 02:52:37.992]  But Tommy, why is the BBC not reporting on this?
[02:52:38.292 --> 02:52:45.494]  What is it about this hate crime that seems to have prompted the left and so much of the mainstream media to ignore it?
[02:52:46.804 --> 02:52:48.905]  And let's have the details as well of this crime.
[02:52:48.925 --> 02:52:52.707]  The details are, young Muslim men, they stopped a Muslim man.
[02:52:52.747 --> 02:52:53.828]  They said to him, what religion are you?
[02:52:54.048 --> 02:52:54.849]  And he said, Muslim.
[02:52:55.109 --> 02:52:56.349]  They said, say the Muslim words.
[02:52:56.970 --> 02:52:59.171]  And he said, there is no prophet but Muhammad.
[02:52:59.551 --> 02:53:00.512]  He said, they left him.
[02:53:00.792 --> 02:53:01.472]  They walked on.
[02:53:01.692 --> 02:53:02.573]  They stopped the next man.
[02:53:03.013 --> 02:53:03.794]  What religion are you?
[02:53:03.954 --> 02:53:04.615]  I'm Christian.
[02:53:04.795 --> 02:53:05.115]  Bang.
[02:53:05.475 --> 02:53:06.396]  They finally beat him.
[02:53:06.436 --> 02:53:07.657]  His girlfriend tried to stop him.
[02:53:07.877 --> 02:53:10.279]  These men just hate crimes where there's a group attacking a man.
[02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:13.022]  They're attacking men who are with their partners, with their girlfriends.
[02:53:13.362 --> 02:53:25.392]  If the roles were reversed, if this was a bunch of white people, a bunch of far-right Christians or whoever, rampaging through the streets asking Muslims if they were Christian, if they said they were Muslims, attacking them viciously, that
[02:53:25.512 --> 02:53:28.895]  That would be a national outrage as it is.
[02:53:29.256 --> 02:53:35.802]  The BBC hasn't even reported it in their local section and these guys tell me they're going to be in jail.
[02:53:35.822 --> 02:53:38.084]  They've got sentences for about 42 weeks.
[02:53:38.545 --> 02:53:43.950]  They're probably going to be out on the streets again within months and no one will even have heard of this because they're not reporting on it.
[02:53:44.370 --> 02:53:54.023]  Can anyone imagine the outcry if Muslim families, because this is what it is, families, men and women, were stopped walking home and asked, are you Muslim?
[02:53:54.263 --> 02:53:56.486]  And when they said yes, they were all violently beaten.
[02:53:56.506 --> 02:53:57.066]  Could you imagine?
[02:53:57.707 --> 02:53:58.208]  Imagine!
[02:53:58.228 --> 02:54:02.633]  It wouldn't just be national outrage, it would be international, it would be worldwide.
[02:54:08.206 --> 02:54:09.866]  They're trying to purge the Internet, folks.
[02:54:09.886 --> 02:54:12.087]  They're trying to go for full control over the Internet.
[02:54:12.107 --> 02:54:13.027]  They want to regulate it.
[02:54:13.247 --> 02:54:14.987]  And it's not to protect you.
[02:54:16.587 --> 02:54:23.529]  It's to protect themselves from the truth being put out there against their lies, against their false narratives.
[02:54:24.409 --> 02:54:25.869]  The crew's about to print me another story.
[02:54:25.889 --> 02:54:27.709]  Some other people are getting banned on YouTube.
[02:54:27.729 --> 02:54:28.510]  We see this going on.
[02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:29.590]  They've demonetized us.
[02:54:29.610 --> 02:54:31.930]  They demonetized Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:32.350 --> 02:54:33.610]  They censor us on Twitter.
[02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:36.711]  But now they're just going to try to erase us entirely, if you dare!
[02:54:37.251 --> 02:54:38.173]  You know what, Andrew Torba?
[02:54:38.193 --> 02:54:39.014]  How dare you?
[02:54:39.475 --> 02:54:44.402]  How dare Andrew Torba try to create a competitive app with Twitter?
[02:54:44.642 --> 02:54:46.224]  Don't you know that Twitter runs the world now?
[02:54:46.445 --> 02:54:47.887]  How dare you compete with Twitter?
[02:54:47.927 --> 02:54:48.628]  How dare you?
[02:54:49.759 --> 02:54:51.180]  Right, it's terrible.
[02:54:51.220 --> 02:54:53.061]  The free market is just such a terrible thing.
[02:54:53.462 --> 02:55:11.513]  The ability to have, you know, the freedom of choice to choose an alternative platform aside from the three or four that own and control and operate and fund every meaningful access point to the internet, every meaningful access point to hardware in terms of technology.
[02:55:11.914 --> 02:55:14.976]  God forbid somebody stands up and says, let's build something new and start over.
[02:55:15.888 --> 02:55:26.032]  So I got this story here, it just came out from the National Review, a, I don't know this guy's name, but you've got other people getting banned from YouTube now.
[02:55:26.052 --> 02:55:36.256]  Apparently there's a Muslim man, Ahmad Musa Jabru and Abu Halima, I'm sorry if I butchered your names, who have now been banned
[02:55:36.856 --> 02:55:41.821]  On YouTube because they're Muslims and they dare comment on radical Muslim terror.
[02:55:41.841 --> 02:55:44.583]  I mean, they dare comment on alt-Muslim terror.
[02:55:44.844 --> 02:55:46.545]  And I want to coin a phrase right now.
[02:55:46.725 --> 02:55:47.726]  I can't take credit for it.
[02:55:47.746 --> 02:55:48.787]  I have to give Daria credit.
[02:55:48.827 --> 02:55:50.008]  She actually coined this phrase.
[02:55:51.109 --> 02:55:58.816]  All these people protesting in the streets, all these people that hate Trump, all these people that we see on Twitter calling us racists,
[02:55:59.437 --> 02:56:01.139]  They're alt-Americans.
[02:56:01.639 --> 02:56:02.680]  You want to call us alt-right?
[02:56:03.181 --> 02:56:04.602]  You want to start throwing the alt around?
[02:56:04.722 --> 02:56:06.384]  Alt this, alt that, everything's alt?
[02:56:06.764 --> 02:56:08.105]  You're alt-Americans.
[02:56:08.245 --> 02:56:17.234]  All of these people that hate Trump, all these congressmen, all these people in government that want to call for Trump's assassination, everybody in the media, you're all alt-Americans.
[02:56:18.348 --> 02:56:20.909]  I think Silicon Valley fits into that narrative as well.
[02:56:21.529 --> 02:56:34.892]  They love preaching about how net neutrality is so important, but I think it's pretty irrelevant when you have a handful of companies that can just no-platform and un-person complete groups and individuals off the internet.
[02:56:34.952 --> 02:56:36.152]  Yeah, just erase you entirely.
[02:56:36.873 --> 02:56:37.333]  Exactly.
[02:56:38.013 --> 02:56:43.514]  And as you pointed out, Twitter doesn't give you the rights over your content.
[02:56:43.934 --> 02:56:45.755]  There's been other people that point this out as well.
[02:56:46.590 --> 02:56:52.241]  If you're on Twitter and you've got all this stuff, all this great content that you created, well they can just erase that.
[02:56:52.361 --> 02:56:52.642]  Goodbye.
[02:56:52.682 --> 02:56:53.042]  Exactly.
[02:56:53.223 --> 02:56:53.463]  Gone.
[02:56:53.844 --> 02:56:54.585]  And then you have nothing.
[02:56:55.546 --> 02:57:02.010]  I mean, there are people that I know that have spent, you know, eight years on Twitter building up a following of 50, 100,000 people.
[02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:05.412]  They have 10,000 plus tweets, whatever, and they wake up and it's gone.
[02:57:05.872 --> 02:57:19.100]  And, you know, we're seeing the same thing on YouTube, where, you know, if you're a content creator on YouTube and your job every day is to produce content, and you wake up and 65, in Paul Joseph Watson's case, what, 95% of his videos demonetized.
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:22.163]  Um, you know, how can you expect to make a living?
[02:57:22.563 --> 02:57:25.206]  Um, and that's very scary stuff that they have that much power.
[02:57:25.306 --> 02:57:27.989]  And that's what we're seeing now is they're going after the money.
[02:57:28.409 --> 02:57:30.871]  So first it was, okay, let's silence them.
[02:57:31.192 --> 02:57:35.396]  Let's use artificial intelligence to automatically flag their accounts and shadow ban them.
[02:57:35.496 --> 02:57:37.798]  And, um, you know, then we'll ban them completely.
[02:57:37.818 --> 02:57:39.920]  Uh, and now they're going after the money.
[02:57:40.021 --> 02:57:42.283]  So they're going, they're demonetizing YouTube channels.
[02:57:42.643 --> 02:57:47.168]  There are no platforming people from PayPal and other payment processing systems.
[02:57:47.589 --> 02:57:51.674]  And that's why I think cryptocurrency is really going to be the solution to that.
[02:57:51.994 --> 02:57:58.502]  And that's why Gab is planning to launch our own cryptocurrency as fast as we can with an initial coin offering to solve that problem.
[02:57:59.079 --> 02:58:04.883]  Well, you've done what is the answer to all this, and that's creating a new platform, competing with these people.
[02:58:04.943 --> 02:58:05.663]  That's the answer.
[02:58:05.683 --> 02:58:08.185]  I mean, that is the most Americana answer.
[02:58:08.205 --> 02:58:11.767]  If you think there's all these racists running around, then compete with them!
[02:58:12.027 --> 02:58:12.988]  Then beat them!
[02:58:13.208 --> 02:58:13.989]  That's America!
[02:58:14.029 --> 02:58:14.849]  That's capitalism!
[02:58:15.210 --> 02:58:15.710]  Beat them!
[02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:21.012]  But they're trying to end the Capitalism Society, they're trying to end the free market, but you've done the right thing.
[02:58:21.052 --> 02:58:23.113]  You created Gab to compete with Twitter.
[02:58:23.333 --> 02:58:26.475]  Now we need people to create something to compete with Google, like DuckDuckGo.
[02:58:26.675 --> 02:58:30.617]  We need people to create something that competes with YouTube, I think it's called YouNow or something like that.
[02:58:30.917 --> 02:58:33.818]  It's time to compete with these people, because we will crush them!
[02:58:34.058 --> 02:58:35.459]  Just look at InfoWars!
[02:58:35.799 --> 02:58:36.299]  Look at us!

[02:58:47.133 --> 02:58:49.254]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:53.795 --> 02:59:02.818]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:02.898 --> 02:59:10.981]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:11.281 --> 02:59:15.982]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:16.162 --> 02:59:22.864]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:22.964 --> 02:59:30.026]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:30.126 --> 02:59:36.988]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:37.148 --> 02:59:41.512]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:41.632 --> 02:59:44.894]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:45.035 --> 02:59:51.180]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:51.320 --> 02:59:53.562]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:56.024 --> 03:00:01.949]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:14.910 --> 03:00:17.052]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:17.553 --> 03:00:22.598]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:00:31.467 --> 03:00:34.250]  Roger Stone is about to take over here in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:34.270 --> 03:00:35.591]  Owen Troyer here for one more segment.
[03:00:36.550 --> 03:00:39.092]  Just gonna do a little news blitz here to try to cover everything.
[03:00:39.453 --> 03:00:42.115]  Bannon, again, ousted from the White House today.
[03:00:42.555 --> 03:00:46.158]  They used the stock market as leverage to get Trump to remove him.
[03:00:46.919 --> 03:00:55.547]  And the swamp creatures, like Powell and Cohn and Karl Rove, all revealed themselves by their reaction to this.
[03:00:57.176 --> 03:00:58.637]  We had another march going on today.
[03:00:58.657 --> 03:01:00.239]  These marches are just going to keep happening.
[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:03.021]  And we actually had this video clip.
[03:01:03.381 --> 03:01:08.166]  Stay away from the Common during Boston Free Speech Rally.
[03:01:09.967 --> 03:01:12.589]  Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston warns.
[03:01:12.669 --> 03:01:13.911]  But you know, here's the thing about this.
[03:01:15.112 --> 03:01:20.977]  You can actually cut that out and just say, Boston Mayor urges people to avoid free speech.
[03:01:22.227 --> 03:01:23.289]  Because that's what this is.
[03:01:23.609 --> 03:01:27.415]  The left is trying to intimidate you from having free speech.
[03:01:27.716 --> 03:01:35.809]  If you want to go out in the streets and say you like Trump, well the media says you're a Nazi, so the alt-left is going to go out there and beat the crap out of you.
[03:01:38.069 --> 03:01:39.030]  Oh, I thought we were playing the clip.
[03:01:39.050 --> 03:01:40.051]  We can go ahead and roll that clip.
[03:01:40.431 --> 03:01:46.176]  On Monday, the governor and I made it very clear we don't want hate groups to come to our city or our state.
[03:01:46.716 --> 03:01:48.878]  We will not tolerate any incitements of violence.
[03:01:49.499 --> 03:01:52.561]  We are taking every precaution necessary to keep our city safe.
[03:01:53.542 --> 03:01:57.466]  I have the utmost confidence in our public safety officials to keep us safe.
[03:01:58.527 --> 03:02:04.612]  They have a comprehensive plan in place, which the secretary and the commissioner will describe in more details in a few moments.
[03:02:05.755 --> 03:02:09.040]  There's been questions about why we granted a permit for the rally tomorrow.
[03:02:09.982 --> 03:02:11.765]  The courts have made it abundantly clear.
[03:02:11.785 --> 03:02:16.813]  They have the right to gather, no matter how repugnant their views are.
[03:02:18.104 --> 03:02:20.765]  But if we don't have the right to create an unsafe condition.
[03:02:20.785 --> 03:02:23.127]  They don't have the right to create unsafe conditions.
[03:02:23.827 --> 03:02:25.848]  So we're gonna respect their right of free speech.
[03:02:26.568 --> 03:02:28.929]  In return, they must respect our city.
[03:02:29.270 --> 03:02:31.991]  You know, I actually have to give the Boston mayor a lot of credit here, guys.
[03:02:32.011 --> 03:02:32.811]  Go ahead and tone that down.
[03:02:32.871 --> 03:02:37.754]  I gotta give him a lot of credit because he's addressing the real issues here and there should be a real debate about this.
[03:02:40.455 --> 03:02:42.816]  Because every time you do a march, the alt-left is going to show up.
[03:02:43.277 --> 03:02:44.097]  I quit saying alt-left.
[03:02:44.377 --> 03:02:45.418]  The alt-Americans.
[03:02:45.838 --> 03:02:49.680]  Anytime you have a free speech rally, alt-Americans are going to show up and try to disrupt it.
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:53.222]  If you want to support Trump, they're going to show up to try to disrupt it.
[03:02:54.690 --> 03:03:07.839]  So the question is, morally, do we want to continue to have these type of marches, which is just adding to more violence, to show the alt-Americans, to show the alt-left, to show who these people are, to expose the media?
[03:03:08.339 --> 03:03:16.844]  Or do we sit back and say, okay, every time we try to do this, they just incite civil war and they lie about us on the news, so I guess we're just going to sit back and avoid free speech.
[03:03:17.965 --> 03:03:21.126]  That's the debate that is really going on right now.
[03:03:21.426 --> 03:03:27.168]  And we also played a clip earlier from Al Sharpton, who says that the Thomas Jefferson memorial should be taken down.
[03:03:28.608 --> 03:03:30.209]  You'll notice what he did in that clip.
[03:03:30.969 --> 03:03:33.470]  He said, my great-great-grandfather was a slave.
[03:03:35.110 --> 03:03:36.871]  They're trying to make it personal.
[03:03:37.751 --> 03:03:39.852]  Al Sharpton is trying to make it personal
[03:03:40.942 --> 03:03:42.363]  On all the black people out there.
[03:03:42.444 --> 03:03:44.305]  Now again, I'm not saying it is or isn't personal.
[03:03:44.345 --> 03:03:53.614]  I'm saying they're trying to put this seed in all of these black people's heads that you have been so wronged by America because your ancestors may have been slaves here.
[03:03:54.095 --> 03:03:55.016]  You should be mad.
[03:03:55.236 --> 03:03:56.197]  You should be ticked off.
[03:03:56.437 --> 03:04:01.662]  You should be calling for the removal of all these monuments because it's personal for you.
[03:04:01.682 --> 03:04:04.405]  Al Sharpton is telling you it's personal.
[03:04:04.465 --> 03:04:05.005]  Don't you get it?
[03:04:05.726 --> 03:04:22.989]  But you have actual real black people who aren't alt-Americans, who are Americans, who go on Twitter, go on Facebook, and put out the most powerful videos, completely denouncing people like Al Sharpton, completely denouncing the actual racism from the alt-Americans against President Trump.
[03:04:23.009 --> 03:04:24.129]  So you've got all that going on.
[03:04:25.709 --> 03:04:26.630]  Oh, and then there's this.
[03:04:26.850 --> 03:04:30.830]  I don't know if Roger's about to be joining, again, joining the show here to take over.
[03:04:31.970 --> 03:04:33.331]  Mother, this is the video clip.
[03:04:33.671 --> 03:04:34.511]  We don't have time for it now.
[03:04:35.541 --> 03:04:39.083]  Mother of woman killed in Charlottesville says she will not speak to Trump.
[03:04:39.404 --> 03:04:41.445]  So now all of a sudden she has a change of tune.
[03:04:42.165 --> 03:04:45.227]  And she also referred to her daughter as Miss Hare.
[03:04:46.248 --> 03:04:47.149]  So I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:04:47.869 --> 03:04:49.630]  Roger Stone is going to take over in the fourth hour.
[03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:50.971]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:50.991 --> 03:04:51.431]  Support us.
[03:04:51.511 --> 03:04:52.712]  Infowarsstore.com folks.
[03:04:52.732 --> 03:04:53.793]  We're taking on the new world order.
[03:05:05.507 --> 03:05:07.388]  Mark Moreno is our guest.
[03:05:07.428 --> 03:05:08.828]  He's been traveling the world.
[03:05:08.848 --> 03:05:11.449]  They've had arrest warrants out for him.
[03:05:11.489 --> 03:05:14.109]  They want him arrested here in the United States.
[03:05:14.249 --> 03:05:22.852]  The governor of New York wants him arrested because he dare questions Al Gore when Al Gore says the polar bears are all dying and can't swim.
[03:05:24.012 --> 03:05:24.893]  New York and L.A.
[03:05:24.933 --> 03:05:28.176]  would be underwater by 2013 because the ice caps were gonna melt.
[03:05:28.316 --> 03:05:29.977]  Actually, Antarctic's at record levels.
[03:05:30.378 --> 03:05:33.140]  But they don't care because they can defraud the public.
[03:05:33.180 --> 03:05:37.884]  But recently, in Australia, he ran into Albert Gore.
[03:05:38.345 --> 03:05:41.507]  The guy that told us Napstangat was great and wanted us to have the TPP.
[03:05:41.848 --> 03:05:46.051]  The guy who uses 34 times what anybody, you know, uses on average in Tennessee.
[03:05:46.512 --> 03:05:49.214]  At one of his gigantor mansions on a lake.
[03:05:49.514 --> 03:05:54.739]  With gigantor boats and gigantor monster trucks and gigantor everything.
[03:05:54.819 --> 03:05:58.523]  But it's okay, because he's an elitist blubberbot.
[03:05:58.824 --> 03:06:04.329]  So here is the evil criminal, Mark Moreno, daring to even speak to the guru.
[03:06:04.449 --> 03:06:04.830]  Here it is.
[03:06:07.535 --> 03:06:10.776]  Can I ask how you got in here?
[03:06:10.816 --> 03:06:12.657]  We've got rebel scum with us here.
[03:06:12.677 --> 03:06:16.779]  They dare talk to one of the greatest con artists on earth.
[03:06:16.839 --> 03:06:22.621]  How dare you speak to the royal highness?
[03:06:34.045 --> 03:06:35.946]  You're not fit to groom his stool!
[03:06:36.266 --> 03:06:41.348]  Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, what do you say for yourself?
[03:06:42.868 --> 03:06:44.429]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[03:06:45.489 --> 03:06:55.993]  Yes, I was in Australia, we were in Melbourne, Australia, and I had to sit through an hour and a half presentation by Al Gore previewing his new sequel, number one.
[03:06:56.033 --> 03:07:02.195]  Number two, we had to wait because Al Gore's devious plan included allowing the front row
[03:07:02.295 --> 03:07:02.615]  We're good to go.
[03:07:17.917 --> 03:07:23.718]  Al Gore gives this presentation that's all anecdotal, just claptrap, and then immediately walks off the stage.
[03:07:23.758 --> 03:07:28.359]  He doesn't even take a single question after people paid $500 plus a head.
[03:07:28.379 --> 03:07:32.360]  He had no time for question and answer, so that's why I decided to follow him out.
[03:07:32.400 --> 03:07:33.640]  I was able to get that.
[03:07:33.700 --> 03:07:36.641]  He was all friendly when he thought I was nice, when he knew who I was.
[03:07:36.661 --> 03:07:44.242]  He literally just brushed me off, kept walking, and departed in his Lexus waiting SUV outside in the parking garage.
[03:07:44.764 --> 03:07:47.705]  And I love how there's some redhead lady toting behind.
[03:07:48.065 --> 03:07:50.706]  She's looking at him, breathing heavy, that she's just near him.
[03:07:51.146 --> 03:07:55.908]  Uh, the guru, I saw him sneeze.
[03:07:55.968 --> 03:07:58.329]  Some of his snot went in my mouth.
[03:07:58.629 --> 03:07:59.749]  And then she looks at you just like...
[03:08:07.319 --> 03:08:17.749]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:08:18.310 --> 03:08:19.891]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:08:28.969 --> 03:08:29.570]  Welcome back.
[03:08:29.950 --> 03:08:33.213]  I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:08:33.334 --> 03:08:37.117]  It's a momentous day in American politics.
[03:08:38.058 --> 03:08:41.822]  White House aide Steve Bannon now out.
[03:08:42.703 --> 03:08:47.427]  Yesterday I wrote a controversial piece for the Daily Caller in which I made the case
[03:08:48.288 --> 03:08:59.456]  That although Bannon is a good man and his heart is in the right place, on issue after issue, he has not stood up for the Trump constituency.
[03:09:00.297 --> 03:09:09.184]  One of the particular areas that I focused on was the question of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[03:09:10.444 --> 03:09:14.026]  Joe Arpaio was a key element of Donald Trump's election.
[03:09:14.587 --> 03:09:23.591]  His testimony for Donald Trump on the immigration issue was a key factor in terms of the presidential candidate's credibility.
[03:09:25.092 --> 03:09:32.641]  Obama Justice Department launched a political hit job, prosecution against Joe Arpaio.
[03:09:33.462 --> 03:09:40.190]  They even brought that action under the wrong statuette to ensure that the sheriff could not get a jury trial.
[03:09:41.051 --> 03:09:52.961]  They actually spied on Arpaio and intercepted his communications with his attorneys during the trial.
[03:09:52.981 --> 03:09:54.303]  A big no-no.
[03:09:54.943 --> 03:10:01.249]  And they communicated the Justice Department directly with the judge, Expartide, in violation of the law.
[03:10:01.969 --> 03:10:10.674]  Despite all of these irregularities, Sheriff Joe could not get a return phone call from Steve Bannon.
[03:10:11.074 --> 03:10:15.977]  He could not get even the sympathetic ear of the Trump White House.
[03:10:16.777 --> 03:10:30.145]  Now, fortunately, comes word that this has come to the President's attention, finally, and that he has ordered the White House Counsel to prepare a pardon for Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[03:10:31.085 --> 03:10:32.985]  This is extraordinarily good news.
[03:10:33.506 --> 03:10:45.288]  The President is headed for Phoenix, and I can think of no better location than Phoenix, Arizona, to announce this act of justice and mercy.
[03:10:45.828 --> 03:10:48.509]  So, kudos to the President.
[03:10:49.669 --> 03:10:53.850]  However, the criticism of his staff remains the same.
[03:10:54.390 --> 03:10:59.391]  It's a shame that the President had to wait so long to learn about this miscarriage.
[03:11:01.773 --> 03:11:12.505]  We also learned today that Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, has met with Julian Assange, the publisher of WikiLeaks.
[03:11:13.286 --> 03:11:19.554]  For some time I have reported here at InfoWars that a secret grand jury had been convened
[03:11:20.655 --> 03:11:30.226]  Originally during the Obama administration, but was not terminated under the Trump Justice Department.
[03:11:30.867 --> 03:11:39.577]  And an effort is being made by the Trump Justice Department to seek a criminal indictment against Assange in the United States.
[03:11:40.618 --> 03:11:46.505]  For what we don't know, it's not clear what, if any, law Mr. Assange has broken.
[03:11:47.085 --> 03:11:49.568]  Julian Assange is not a Russian asset.
[03:11:49.648 --> 03:12:00.280]  The government mindlessly, through the intelligence agencies, repeats that mantra over and over again, without a scintilla of evidence that it is true.
[03:12:01.401 --> 03:12:15.633]  At the same time, Mr. Assange is a journalist who is neither of the left nor the right, but who is outraged by the tremendous abuses of power and corruption that he has learned about.
[03:12:16.394 --> 03:12:32.624]  Now, for those who say, well, Assange's sin is that he prints stolen material, material he has received from whistleblowers, perhaps you should look at the Pentagon Papers case, New York Times versus USA, during the Nixon administration.
[03:12:33.084 --> 03:12:42.530]  Or perhaps you should look at the writings of Bob Woodward, who regularly publishes classified information that he's gotten from third-party sources.
[03:12:43.130 --> 03:12:47.431]  This is within the greatest traditions of American journalism.
[03:12:47.551 --> 03:12:53.233]  It is hardly illegal, and it is not illegal in the case of Julian Assange.
[03:12:53.993 --> 03:13:01.796]  Who will now tell the President that his Justice Department is seeking an indictment against WikiLeaks?
[03:13:02.356 --> 03:13:21.746]  Mr. Bannon is gone, but I can think of many individuals with solid Trump credentials, real libertarians, real liberty-oriented Republicans who worked in this campaign, men like David Urban or Ed Martin, who could easily fill these shoes.
[03:13:22.546 --> 03:13:36.354]  The idea that conservatives will be at a disadvantage because the Trump White House is now largely peopled with New York liberal Democrats like Gary Cohn or the President's son-in-law.
[03:13:36.854 --> 03:13:51.143]  Well, that may be true, but it's only true because Steve Bannon would never go to bat for Trump campaign veterans seeking positions in the Trump administration, either in the White House or in the departments.
[03:13:51.923 --> 03:13:57.373]  As I said earlier, it's like an individual throwing themselves on the mercy of the court.
[03:13:57.914 --> 03:14:04.486]  A man who kills his parents and then argues that he should receive mercy because he's an orphan.
[03:14:06.460 --> 03:14:18.695]  We are therefore, I think, at a point where the questions come at me, both by Twitter and tweet and text and phone call, fast and furious.
[03:14:19.015 --> 03:14:23.000]  Is the elimination, or I should say the termination,
[03:14:23.841 --> 03:14:27.284]  Well, the Trump Revolution is much larger than Steve Bannon.
[03:14:27.304 --> 03:14:33.429]  It's much larger than any one individual, other than Donald Trump himself.
[03:14:48.385 --> 03:14:53.630]  One of Mr. Bannon's greatest sins was calling himself the chief White House strategist.
[03:14:54.511 --> 03:15:01.458]  While the chief strategist of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and of his White House, is Donald Trump.
[03:15:02.455 --> 03:15:15.840]  With all fairness, by the time Bannon joined the campaign for the final weeks, the basic tenets of the Trump platform had long been decided.
[03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:28.705]  It was Donald Trump himself who hit upon immigration and the wall, who hit upon the idea of revamping and overhauling our veterans health care system, which is sadly broken.
[03:15:29.505 --> 03:15:35.370]  Who talked about the inequity of our NATO partners not paying their fair share.
[03:15:35.811 --> 03:15:44.037]  Who talked about how the enormous international globalist trade deals were sucking the jobs out of middle America.
[03:15:44.838 --> 03:15:49.882]  Donald Trump is the man who came up with these themes, not Stephen K. Bannon.
[03:15:50.482 --> 03:15:58.868]  And with the help of Sam Nunberg, who was terminated early in the campaign, he honed each one of these messages to perfection.
[03:15:59.608 --> 03:16:05.953]  And he never deviated from them from the early campaign until Election Day.
[03:16:06.653 --> 03:16:11.697]  No, the chief strategist of the Trump campaign is Donald Trump.
[03:16:13.642 --> 03:16:19.425]  We are, therefore, I'm confident that there will not be a change in course.
[03:16:19.485 --> 03:16:25.689]  The idea that the Trump White House will move to the left is unfounded.
[03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:31.752]  And, in fact, the entire dynamics surrounding the Charlottesville incident
[03:16:32.412 --> 03:16:46.162]  Which smells more and more like a false flag with every passing day as more and more investigative journalists like Lee Sternihan start to dig into the facts about what really transpired.
[03:16:47.123 --> 03:16:55.069]  We learned that this was a provocation because the Russian collusion delusion has failed.
[03:16:56.144 --> 03:17:05.388]  They could get no traction on the phony Russian issue, so now we have slipped back to race-baiting as a political tactic.
[03:17:06.328 --> 03:17:16.112]  One thing I agree with Steve Bannon on, in an interview I saw yesterday, if the Democrats want to talk about race, and we talk about economic prosperity,
[03:17:16.992 --> 03:17:17.693]  We will win.
[03:17:18.353 --> 03:17:27.019]  If Donald Trump will stick to his guns that violence on the left or the right must be denounced is wrong, is not the answer.
[03:17:27.540 --> 03:17:32.724]  But focus most principally on the need for economic prosperity.
[03:17:33.524 --> 03:17:44.929]  Well, then the president will fight for his corporate tax cut, cutting our corporate taxes below those of Mexico, Japan, China, Canada.
[03:17:45.910 --> 03:17:57.295]  That would spark what they will call the Trump boom, perhaps one of the greatest peacetime expansions that we will ever experience.
[03:17:58.055 --> 03:18:13.072]  Now would be a very good time to remind you that we are under attack here at InfoWars and a good time for you to go to the InfoWars.com store where we have an extraordinary special going on which we named after our friends at BuzzFeed.

[03:19:03.602 --> 03:19:05.343]  That Alex Jones has planned.

[03:19:26.757 --> 03:19:31.406]  I'm Roger Stone, filling in for Alex Jones today on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:31.787 --> 03:19:33.150]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:19:33.390 --> 03:19:34.392]  I'll be right back.
[03:20:08.454 --> 03:20:09.775]  You know what this is called?
[03:20:09.795 --> 03:20:10.615]  Megatroll!
[03:20:10.635 --> 03:20:16.598]  This will be all over the newspapers!
[03:20:17.579 --> 03:20:18.439]  Sorry, I'm done!
[03:20:24.542 --> 03:20:26.543]  Only one of these two things was actually published.
[03:20:27.144 --> 03:20:29.005]  And it wasn't the one the establishment wanted.
[03:20:31.747 --> 03:20:33.548]  Look at this lovely Lifetime special.
[03:20:33.608 --> 03:20:34.468]  Oh, there's Bill Clinton.
[03:20:34.568 --> 03:20:36.468]  Park Ridge to Pennsylvania Avenue.
[03:20:38.549 --> 03:20:38.809]  Oh.
[03:20:39.089 --> 03:20:39.569]  Commencing.
[03:20:39.649 --> 03:20:42.250]  Oh, there she is, the little CIA operative in college.
[03:20:42.350 --> 03:20:43.670]  Newsweek is charting.
[03:20:43.830 --> 03:20:45.611]  It's about her victory after victory.
[03:20:45.631 --> 03:20:48.292]  The meteoric rise of the Zeta-3 Queen.
[03:20:48.472 --> 03:20:49.652]  It's inexorable.
[03:20:49.812 --> 03:20:50.252]  Inexorable.
[03:20:50.292 --> 03:20:51.893]  It's unstoppable rise.
[03:20:51.973 --> 03:20:53.313]  Destiny.
[03:20:53.793 --> 03:20:55.534]  Nothing could possibly have stopped it.
[03:20:57.674 --> 03:21:00.515]  Oh, and now we get to the really good stuff.
[03:21:00.715 --> 03:21:02.176]  The new war on Hillary.
[03:21:02.396 --> 03:21:03.296]  The misogyny.
[03:21:03.616 --> 03:21:05.937]  Oh, they attacked her but she fought through.
[03:21:06.197 --> 03:21:07.437]  Oh, and there she is.
[03:21:07.677 --> 03:21:09.498]  Looking noble and defiant.
[03:21:09.938 --> 03:21:11.498]  Noble and defiant.
[03:21:11.618 --> 03:21:18.941]  Merging from her husband's shadow to be a real, convincing and authentic person.
[03:21:18.961 --> 03:21:20.521]  Crawling out of the mouth of hell.
[03:21:20.541 --> 03:21:21.762]  Why have you become Churchill?
[03:21:22.062 --> 03:21:23.122]  Friends with Obama.
[03:21:24.555 --> 03:21:26.036]  She's getting the job done.
[03:21:26.236 --> 03:21:28.058]  She looks like she's about to accomplish something.
[03:21:28.098 --> 03:21:30.360]  There's a lot of foreign payments coming into the foundation.
[03:21:30.380 --> 03:21:32.001]  She just raked in a few more billion.
[03:21:32.441 --> 03:21:34.343]  Put a few more dictators in charge.
[03:21:34.383 --> 03:21:39.466]  This morning I tweeted a rainbow hashtag to my gay followers to pander to them.
[03:21:39.506 --> 03:21:42.509]  The same morning as I accepted 50 million from Saudi Arabia.
[03:21:42.549 --> 03:21:43.049]  How's that?
[03:21:43.369 --> 03:21:45.511]  And Barack lets out a hearty chuckle.
[03:21:45.991 --> 03:21:46.472]  And there it is.
[03:21:46.492 --> 03:21:49.014]  Look at the beautiful... Madam President!
[03:21:49.154 --> 03:21:51.276]  It's the moment we've all been waiting for.
[03:21:51.336 --> 03:21:53.478]  It is the inevitable Hillary victory.
[03:21:53.638 --> 03:21:54.138]  There we go.
[03:21:54.158 --> 03:21:56.440]  Oh, now he's gonna be the first man.
[03:21:56.801 --> 03:21:57.401]  Back there we go.
[03:21:57.421 --> 03:21:59.383]  Rapist-in-Chief back in the Oval Office.
[03:21:59.423 --> 03:22:00.284]  Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[03:22:04.363 --> 03:22:05.384]  Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[03:22:05.824 --> 03:22:10.108]  I will be exiting the building with the greatest piece of merchandise I could ever have hoped for, so thank you for my whistle.
[03:22:17.790 --> 03:22:18.831]  Hillary's in great health!
[03:22:19.111 --> 03:22:21.352]  It's like when Pele elects.
[03:22:21.412 --> 03:22:26.014]  Can you just imagine if MSNBC hosted, Hillary's literally sucking her dry.
[03:22:26.034 --> 03:22:28.636]  She's like, she's like, the president elects in great health.
[03:22:29.716 --> 03:22:33.398]  Look at the shot, and she's gonna spew green, green, green, green.
[03:22:33.759 --> 03:22:36.940]  That's the shot.
[03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:37.521]  Here's the face.
[03:22:37.541 --> 03:22:37.681]  Enjoy!
[03:22:50.431 --> 03:22:52.093]  You get into it, you see, I love you.
[03:22:59.659 --> 03:23:07.526]  After the 360 revolution is complete, and immediately before the ejection of the goo, a photographer manages to catch her head in the forward position.
[03:23:07.866 --> 03:23:10.088]  There we go, and we've got, oh look, and there's her.
[03:23:10.228 --> 03:23:13.771]  There's Webster Hubble, there's Mr. Ed leading through to get a bucket of grain.
[03:23:16.457 --> 03:23:17.278]  And there she is.
[03:23:17.578 --> 03:23:24.784]  There she is, calmly explaining while he looms over her in a sinister... Wasn't that great with him prowling behind her like a predator?
[03:23:24.824 --> 03:23:29.729]  He was like a lion, you know, just prowling around, just waiting to strike.
[03:23:29.769 --> 03:23:33.071]  You know, you're a liar.
[03:23:33.091 --> 03:23:33.552]  You'd be in jail.
[03:23:33.592 --> 03:23:34.553]  And you ought to be in prison.
[03:23:34.573 --> 03:23:35.473]  You'd be in jail.
[03:23:35.774 --> 03:23:36.534]  Oh my goodness.
[03:23:37.095 --> 03:23:38.376]  While you talk, I'm going to bow down right now.
[03:23:44.672 --> 03:23:47.794]  She's looking at some little black kid she wants to put in prison.
[03:23:47.914 --> 03:23:50.576]  That's what I meant by my joke.
[03:23:50.596 --> 03:23:52.217]  She's like, look at these super predators.
[03:23:52.257 --> 03:23:56.600]  She's back in her pearls, she's looking presidential, and she's ready to get to work.
[03:23:56.760 --> 03:24:03.064]  And wouldn't it have been wonderful if that glorious, sunny, democratic future had come to pass?
[03:24:05.822 --> 03:24:14.369]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:14.749 --> 03:24:17.671]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:24:18.752 --> 03:24:20.453]  Welcome back.
[03:24:21.974 --> 03:24:24.876]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:24:25.956 --> 03:24:31.179]  It's well known that I have been a critic of the CNN analyst Anna Navarro.
[03:24:32.100 --> 03:24:34.101]  First, a little truth in advertising.
[03:24:34.221 --> 03:24:36.963]  They should stop calling her a Republican strategist.
[03:24:37.263 --> 03:24:42.446]  She has never strategized a Republican campaign for any office in her life.
[03:24:43.346 --> 03:24:49.032]  She enjoys denigrating the president, calling him names constantly, bigot, racist pig.
[03:24:49.672 --> 03:24:59.142]  She is endlessly abusive to her co-talent on CNN, John Phillips and Scotty Nell Hughes and others.
[03:24:59.742 --> 03:25:06.969]  Yet whenever she is criticized, she goes running to management, goes running to Jeff Zucker to complain.
[03:25:07.930 --> 03:25:21.141]  Now, finally, Anna Navarro, the airhead diva, a woman with no campaign experience or qualifications for her position as an analyst, has finally met her match.
[03:25:21.302 --> 03:25:32.591]  Today, she confronted Ed Martin, formerly of Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, and a key organizer in Donald Trump's Missouri campaign.
[03:25:32.952 --> 03:25:34.473]  Let's take a look at what happened.
[03:25:35.518 --> 03:25:40.241]  Everybody, every station, every pundit said, ah, he's getting more stability.
[03:25:40.281 --> 03:25:44.064]  I think we do need a president that's going to get better people all the time and improve people.
[03:25:44.084 --> 03:25:45.345]  But let me be very clear.
[03:25:45.365 --> 03:25:48.907]  Anna Navarro's wing of the Republican Party is over.
[03:25:49.267 --> 03:25:56.592]  The people that wanted amnesty, illegals on demand, free trade, that party, Romney, you know, Anna backed
[03:25:56.972 --> 03:25:59.133]  Huntsman, Romney, McCain, and Jeb.
[03:25:59.454 --> 03:26:00.795]  They lost everything.
[03:26:00.875 --> 03:26:01.795]  So we need to move on.
[03:26:02.135 --> 03:26:04.117]  Look, Corker is a serious man.
[03:26:04.137 --> 03:26:05.557]  He's expressing his concern.
[03:26:05.838 --> 03:26:10.240]  On the other hand, Corker and the Senate are still doing the work of Trump.
[03:26:10.280 --> 03:26:14.283]  Trump has put in more judges than Bush or Obama did at the same point.
[03:26:14.563 --> 03:26:16.404]  He's moving ahead with regulatory reform.
[03:26:16.684 --> 03:26:23.789]  In America, where I live, not in whatever, where Anna and everyone talks to each other, we're seeing progress for America first.
[03:26:24.209 --> 03:26:25.790]  It really looks good to us.
[03:26:25.970 --> 03:26:27.291]  It feels better to us.
[03:26:27.631 --> 03:26:28.811]  Somebody's on our side.
[03:26:28.891 --> 03:26:29.632]  That's what's happening.
[03:26:30.932 --> 03:26:32.253]  Anna, you should probably respond.
[03:26:33.093 --> 03:26:34.734]  Honestly, I don't want to respond to this guy.
[03:26:34.754 --> 03:26:38.316]  I mean, I just, I mean, I, you know, frankly, life is too short for me to spend it on that one.
[03:26:38.356 --> 03:26:39.296]  I do want to talk about this.
[03:26:39.317 --> 03:26:40.217]  She voted for Hillary.
[03:26:40.277 --> 03:26:40.997]  She voted for Hillary.
[03:26:41.017 --> 03:26:42.118]  You voted for Hillary.
[03:26:42.458 --> 03:26:44.280]  Exactly, because I refuse to listen.
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:46.381]  You're not going to engage me, honest to goodness.
[03:26:47.302 --> 03:26:51.265]  I find it a useless exercise and waste of my time and my life doing this.
[03:26:51.606 --> 03:26:59.152]  So can I go back to the initial subject of matter that we were talking about before trying to get distracted, which is what Republicans are saying.
[03:26:59.632 --> 03:27:06.158]  And I commend those Republicans that are speaking out because I think it's important for the country to see that there are Republicans standing up for.
[03:27:12.200 --> 03:27:13.281]  And there you have it.
[03:27:13.381 --> 03:27:17.842]  Somebody finally confronts Ina Navarro with her nonsense.
[03:27:18.943 --> 03:27:21.504]  This is an extraordinarily abusive person.
[03:27:21.644 --> 03:27:30.988]  The people at CNN, the makeup people, the gaffers, the hairdressers and others talk to me about her endless abuse.
[03:27:31.548 --> 03:27:36.090]  She really thinks she's something special when she's nothing at all.
[03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:49.722]  Later in the program, we're going to be taking your calls, because there are many, many questions about what will happen now with Steve Bannon out of the White House, and what will happen in the wake of the Charlottesville attack.
[03:27:49.762 --> 03:27:50.422]  That number is 1-800.
[03:27:52.244 --> 03:27:52.284]  800-259-9231.
[03:27:52.304 --> 03:27:52.584]  Again, 800-259-9231.
[03:27:52.764 --> 03:27:54.825]  I am anxious to take your calls here at InfoWars.
[03:27:54.925 --> 03:27:58.907]  Also, while you've got a minute, go to the InfoWars.com store where we have our 1776
[03:28:08.411 --> 03:28:09.812]  BuzzFeed special.
[03:28:10.212 --> 03:28:14.355]  This is dedicated to our friend Ben Smith at BuzzFeed.
[03:28:14.755 --> 03:28:26.442]  Since the BuzzFeed attack on the Infowars store last week, why our sales are up dramatically as thousands of patriots have taken to the internet to give us the support we need.
[03:28:26.782 --> 03:28:30.924]  You will not find sales like this anytime again soon.
[03:28:30.984 --> 03:28:34.146]  So folks, load up on some of the best products.
[03:28:34.186 --> 03:28:34.987]  We're talking about
[03:28:35.447 --> 03:28:39.510]  Caveman, chocolate or strawberry at 30% off.
[03:28:39.550 --> 03:28:46.715]  We're talking about Silver Bullet, but my all-time favorite, Brain Force, which I'm using right now.
[03:28:47.135 --> 03:28:48.636]  Popped two of them before the show.
[03:28:48.976 --> 03:28:51.198]  Helps keep you focused and alert.
[03:28:51.738 --> 03:28:53.840]  These are the very best of the best.
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:58.203]  And when you buy on the Infowars.com store now,
[03:28:58.823 --> 03:29:00.805]  You're helping the fight for freedom.
[03:29:00.845 --> 03:29:03.827]  You're helping us struggle against the globalists.
[03:29:04.388 --> 03:29:05.349]  We need your support.
[03:29:05.689 --> 03:29:07.030]  We value your support.
[03:29:07.430 --> 03:29:08.391]  The time is now.
[03:29:08.892 --> 03:29:14.957]  Please go to the InfoWars.com store and stick it right up the nose of BuzzFeed.
[03:29:15.557 --> 03:29:16.498]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:29:17.019 --> 03:29:21.963]  Happy to be sitting in for Alex Jones and anxious to take your calls.
[03:29:21.983 --> 03:29:22.163]  800-259-9231.
[03:29:22.203 --> 03:29:23.304]  I'll be right back.
[03:29:52.861 --> 03:29:55.549]  On the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.569 --> 03:29:59.179]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:04.301 --> 03:30:05.882]  You cannot beat these deals.
[03:30:05.922 --> 03:30:07.883]  These are our all-time best deals.
[03:30:07.943 --> 03:30:10.164]  Silver Bullet, Colloil Silver, 66% off.
[03:30:10.544 --> 03:30:12.245]  Mico ZX, 46% off.
[03:30:12.285 --> 03:30:13.966]  Brain Forge, 55% off.
[03:30:14.006 --> 03:30:15.367]  Survival Shield, 55% off.
[03:30:15.707 --> 03:30:17.048]  Secret 12, 55% off.
[03:30:17.668 --> 03:30:29.775]  The BuzzFeed group promoting this said the best final of the B12 is $35 and that we're bad for selling it for $17.76 when ours is private-labeled by the very group they chose to say, here's the best and here's Alex's.
[03:30:29.895 --> 03:30:31.936]  I mean, that's just providence that that happened.
[03:30:32.596 --> 03:30:34.537]  So BuzzFeed just says we are the best, the cleanest.
[03:30:34.857 --> 03:30:35.798]  We're just absolutely.
[03:30:36.138 --> 03:30:38.039]  And then they're just frothing, don't even know what to do.
[03:30:38.459 --> 03:30:39.419]  So please support us.
[03:30:39.519 --> 03:30:40.380]  As you know, there's a war.
[03:30:40.400 --> 03:30:41.600]  We're trying to shut everybody down.
[03:30:41.640 --> 03:30:42.461]  Please pray for us.

[03:31:01.971 --> 03:31:02.972]  Just make the commitment.
[03:31:03.853 --> 03:31:07.376]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[03:31:07.836 --> 03:31:13.901]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[03:31:14.302 --> 03:31:17.084]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:17.465 --> 03:31:20.487]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:31:20.687 --> 03:31:24.130]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[03:31:24.471 --> 03:31:24.871]  The left
[03:31:26.052 --> 03:31:35.881]  They have the complete monopoly on culture which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:31:35.941 --> 03:31:38.343]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[03:31:38.824 --> 03:31:42.688]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[03:31:42.748 --> 03:31:44.809]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[03:31:45.430 --> 03:31:50.817]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[03:31:51.057 --> 03:31:57.326]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[03:31:57.386 --> 03:31:59.088]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[03:31:59.248 --> 03:32:00.430]  It's available right now.

[03:33:13.397 --> 03:33:13.917]  News.
[03:33:14.437 --> 03:33:15.278]  Analysis.
[03:33:15.798 --> 03:33:16.478]  Reports.
[03:33:16.818 --> 03:33:19.399]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.899 --> 03:33:34.323]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:35.423 --> 03:33:36.043]  Welcome back.
[03:33:37.961 --> 03:33:41.326]  I'm your host, Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:33:41.406 --> 03:33:53.364]  I spoke to Alex this morning after the vicious attack on him on the streets of Seattle where he was scalded with hot coffee by some tolerant liberal believer in free speech.
[03:33:54.205 --> 03:34:02.474]  Alex is fine and he's anxious to get back in the fight, but he urged me to take your calls and that's what we're going to do here in just a moment.
[03:34:03.435 --> 03:34:06.339]  I do want to mention before we do that, that the U.S.
[03:34:09.562 --> 03:34:15.706]  Cannabis Business Expo is September 14th and 15th, and I have agreed to speak there.
[03:34:16.407 --> 03:34:21.870]  Yesterday, we announced the formation, the formal formation of the U.S.
[03:34:21.950 --> 03:34:39.222]  Cannabis Coalition, a bipartisan, non-profit, ad hoc committee designed to simply call on President Donald Trump to keep his courageous pledge to let the states decide when it comes to the question of medicinal marijuana.
[03:34:40.563 --> 03:34:44.847]  29 states have now legalized some form of medicinal marijuana.
[03:34:45.307 --> 03:34:55.636]  It is providing relief to millions, including veterans, providing millions in revenues for states and counties, and creating thousands of jobs.
[03:34:56.297 --> 03:35:13.987]  Despite this, the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have both threatened a crackdown going back to the days pre-Obama when the federal government prosecuted marijuana use and distribution in the individual states.
[03:35:15.037 --> 03:35:24.080]  Yesterday, the website uscannabiscoalition.org was hacked and down for several hours.
[03:35:24.520 --> 03:35:43.585]  Today, we see an influx of Media Matters for America trolls trying to break up what is a bipartisan organization, which I am heading with the Orlando trial attorney and prominent Democrat, John Morgan, a prospective candidate for governor of Florida.
[03:35:44.125 --> 03:35:57.296]  Morgan is personally responsible for financing the Democratic past constitutional amendment in Florida that legalized medicinal marijuana in the Sunshine State.
[03:35:58.057 --> 03:35:59.598]  He's a hero of mine.
[03:35:59.919 --> 03:36:09.107]  And this bipartisan committee includes both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, libertarians and progressives.
[03:36:09.747 --> 03:36:17.576]  Go to the site, check it out, come to the Business Expo, help us stop the trolls at MediaMatters.com.
[03:36:18.557 --> 03:36:20.780]  Now let's go to your questions.
[03:36:20.880 --> 03:36:26.026]  I'm going to start with Dave from my home state of Connecticut, the Nutmeg State.
[03:36:26.106 --> 03:36:27.407]  Dave, what's on your mind?
[03:36:29.009 --> 03:36:30.070]  Roger, thanks for having me.
[03:36:31.685 --> 03:36:32.806]  We love you in Connecticut.
[03:36:32.846 --> 03:36:33.867]  We love Donald Trump.
[03:36:35.147 --> 03:36:36.528]  We lost Michael Flynn.
[03:36:36.628 --> 03:36:38.830]  Today we lost Steve Bannon.
[03:36:39.930 --> 03:36:40.331]  I get it.
[03:36:40.411 --> 03:36:44.593]  He should have hired you to be in the White House with everyone else.
[03:36:45.614 --> 03:36:49.616]  But we're left with Gary Cohn, who's a registered Democrat.
[03:36:49.636 --> 03:36:53.639]  I just think we need to try and hang together.
[03:36:54.693 --> 03:36:58.077]  Before we hang separately, and I just wanted to throw that in there and see what you thought.
[03:36:58.537 --> 03:37:00.620]  Well, I agree with you about General Flynn.
[03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:02.942]  He should never have been dismissed.
[03:37:03.483 --> 03:37:09.229]  The President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, gave the President a bad piece of advice on that subject.
[03:37:10.491 --> 03:37:12.913]  But at the same time, this has nothing to do with me.
[03:37:13.534 --> 03:37:15.736]  I have no interest in going into government.
[03:37:16.437 --> 03:37:17.957]  I'm a free spirit.
[03:37:18.097 --> 03:37:28.779]  I think I can be more effective on behalf of the president right here at Infowars.com and at Stone Cold Truth and out speaking around the country and so on.
[03:37:29.280 --> 03:37:38.541]  But I do think that there are able men and women who were key players in the Trump revolution who were never recruited for this administration.
[03:37:38.581 --> 03:37:41.582]  In fact, they couldn't even get their calls returned.
[03:37:42.482 --> 03:37:48.907]  And on issue after issue, unfortunately Steve Bannon, who's a good man, did not step up to the plate.
[03:37:49.988 --> 03:38:00.855]  For those who complain that the White House is now full of liberal New York Democrats, those are the same people who didn't help any other Trump supporters get into the Trump administration.
[03:38:01.816 --> 03:38:03.399]  I agree with you on Gary Cohn.
[03:38:03.419 --> 03:38:04.600]  I think he has to go.
[03:38:04.620 --> 03:38:09.327]  And I do think that, for example, that General H.R.
[03:38:09.367 --> 03:38:18.320]  McMaster, who we have now tied directly to George Soros, not only in terms of his communications with Soros as based on
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:48.280]  Reports from an Israeli intelligence, but also linking him to a think tank prior to his service in the Trump White House That was funded by Soros and the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation These people also must go And I'm not by any means in that camp, but on issue after issue whether it is the plight of Sheriff Joe Arpaio or the prosecution
[03:38:49.040 --> 03:39:00.426]  Of Julian Assange, or whether it is the State Department, where Rex Tillerson has turned out to be a puppet of Condoleezza Rice.
[03:39:01.326 --> 03:39:08.330]  And the Trump foreign policy looks to me like the Bush-Romney-Neocon foreign policy.
[03:39:09.130 --> 03:39:14.894]  Dave, you're right, there's a vacuum in the White House and we need a Trump person to fill it, not Roger Stone.
[03:39:15.314 --> 03:39:22.558]  There are many fine young and fine men and women who are capable of filling Mr. Bannon's shoes.
[03:39:23.099 --> 03:39:28.862]  Let's go to Stephen in the state of Florida, my new home state.
[03:39:28.902 --> 03:39:30.143]  Stephen, what's on your mind?
[03:39:31.744 --> 03:39:32.605]  Yeah, hey Roger.
[03:39:33.385 --> 03:39:34.146]  Can you hear me?
[03:39:34.246 --> 03:39:34.706]  Yes, indeed.
[03:39:35.931 --> 03:39:36.251]  Okay.
[03:39:36.712 --> 03:39:38.913]  Yeah, but what I wanted to talk about is this.
[03:39:39.053 --> 03:39:40.234]  As a student of U.S.
[03:39:40.274 --> 03:39:52.220]  history, you know that our Supreme Court has come down with decisions stating to this effect that an attack on America is an attack on Jesus Christ because it was founded as a Christian nation.
[03:39:52.261 --> 03:39:56.203]  That's almost a direct quote from one of their decisions they came down with.
[03:39:56.543 --> 03:39:58.384]  That's when our Supreme Court was good.
[03:39:58.404 --> 03:40:01.186]  Hopefully we're going back in that direction.
[03:40:01.206 --> 03:40:03.087]  But the reason I say that is because
[03:40:03.987 --> 03:40:12.815]  Uh, there's a man that's gone on Alex Jones Show now a couple of times, three or four times, including yesterday, and that is Rodney Howard Brown.
[03:40:12.855 --> 03:40:18.601]  And that's the thing, he's being called Rodney Brown because he doesn't want people to know about him.
[03:40:19.341 --> 03:40:25.265]  To recognize who he really is and what he's trying to do, which I, this is what I believe, okay?
[03:40:25.665 --> 03:40:29.708]  And I would encourage Alex and his reporters to look into this man's background.
[03:40:30.188 --> 03:40:40.954]  This guy spearheaded the notorious Holy Laughter movement that made a total mockery of Jesus Christ and the gospel ministry.
[03:40:41.415 --> 03:40:47.999]  And the thing is, when he says he will not disclose the supposed congressman he met with,
[03:40:48.610 --> 03:40:51.320]  That told him that they're going to take out Trump.
[03:40:52.080 --> 03:40:56.943]  That is proof to me that he is lying about that situation.
[03:40:56.963 --> 03:41:14.374]  I don't dispute the information he gave about his knowledge of the New World Order and history and such, but I think he's just using Alex and this whole situation with Trump, what's now going on, as a name dropper, someone that's just trying to further his own selfish agenda.
[03:41:14.414 --> 03:41:18.477]  Because if indeed the President is being threatened like that,
[03:41:18.877 --> 03:41:19.117]  All right.
[03:41:35.390 --> 03:41:38.011]  All right, Stephen, I think we've got the gist.
[03:41:38.051 --> 03:41:39.531]  Let me make a couple comments.
[03:41:39.591 --> 03:41:57.617]  I don't know Pastor Brown, but my friend Gary Heaven brought my attention to a very disturbing article that appeared at Zero Hedge in which both the former CIA Director John Brennan, who is a convert to radical Islam, who is actually a convert
[03:41:58.157 --> 03:42:15.893]  to Wahhabism, at the time that he was the CIA Station Chief in Rita, actually threatens the life of the President of the United States, only to be joined by James Clapper, who was the head of Defense Intelligence under Obama.
[03:42:16.554 --> 03:42:23.600]  These would essentially, these gentlemen saying that if Mueller is fired,
[03:42:24.441 --> 03:42:31.588]  That Trump will be taken out, and they don't mean that in a democratic sense.
[03:42:32.068 --> 03:42:36.653]  There's some footage you see of the actual program with Wolf Blitzer.
[03:42:37.253 --> 03:42:47.944]  This would lead me to believe that the fundamental story of Pastor Brown is correct, that there is a plot to remove the president.
[03:42:48.824 --> 03:43:03.476]  That I imagine would only be triggered if they believe that they cannot co-opt him as General Kelly is trying to do right now, or they can't impeach him based on a trumped-up charge brought by Mr. Mueller.
[03:43:03.576 --> 03:43:07.019]  Call it perjury or some other false charge.
[03:43:07.779 --> 03:43:09.141]  I pray every night
[03:43:09.841 --> 03:43:13.042]  For the president's personal safety and the safety of his family?
[03:43:13.542 --> 03:43:15.182]  There are a lot of lunatics out there.
[03:43:15.682 --> 03:43:20.763]  Donald Trump is a brave and courageous man even to pursue this job, never mind to fill it.
[03:43:21.803 --> 03:43:23.824]  But Stephen, thank you for your call.
[03:43:24.624 --> 03:43:26.484]  Let's take another while we have time.
[03:43:26.504 --> 03:43:29.285]  How about Michael in Texas?
[03:43:29.405 --> 03:43:30.465]  Michael, let her rip.
[03:43:33.086 --> 03:43:33.286]  Yes.
[03:43:35.302 --> 03:43:37.384]  Mr. Stone, nice to speak to you.
[03:43:37.424 --> 03:43:40.586]  Enjoy your commentary on Alex Jones' mental wars.
[03:43:40.766 --> 03:43:41.467]  Thank you, Michael.
[03:43:41.487 --> 03:43:42.368]  What's your question?
[03:43:43.228 --> 03:43:46.411]  Yes, I take exception to one of the comments you made on Mr. Bannon, however.
[03:43:46.691 --> 03:43:58.000]  You said, I guess, well, you commented that you didn't think that it would go more left with the absence of Mr. Bannon, but I caution you to realize that it was people like Nancy Pelosi
[03:43:59.034 --> 03:44:00.395]  Asking for his ouster.
[03:44:00.895 --> 03:44:01.735]  So now he's gone.
[03:44:01.955 --> 03:44:06.217]  So essentially, Mr. Trump has complied with the request of Nancy Pelosi.
[03:44:06.537 --> 03:44:08.818]  So how much more left do you want to get?
[03:44:09.718 --> 03:44:18.661]  Well, he was also complying with my request yesterday in the Daily Caller and a number of other conservatives who've determined that Steve is a spent force.
[03:44:19.282 --> 03:44:22.083]  Nobody is indispensable in this revolution.
[03:44:22.103 --> 03:44:24.224]  Not Roger Stone, not Alex Jones.
[03:44:24.384 --> 03:44:25.144]  Nobody but
[03:44:25.744 --> 03:44:26.525]  The President.
[03:44:26.605 --> 03:44:28.266]  He is indispensable.
[03:44:28.927 --> 03:44:31.209]  And I believe he will be replaced.
[03:44:31.769 --> 03:44:40.857]  I will be on the forefront of those criticizing General McMaster, criticizing General Kelly, as I just did.
[03:44:42.338 --> 03:44:46.582]  I would see your argument if Bannon had been more effective.
[03:44:47.342 --> 03:44:53.385]  But his greatest single goal seemed to be the self-aggrandizement of Bannon himself.
[03:44:53.566 --> 03:45:01.390]  This new book, Devil's Bargain, is a very thinly veiled vanity biography, probably paid for by Bannon himself.
[03:45:02.351 --> 03:45:11.576]  And every other page is about Steve Bannon's career in Wall Street, his career in Hollywood, and his career as a computer game designer.
[03:45:12.276 --> 03:45:15.980]  I thought this book was about Donald Trump's assent to the presidency.
[03:45:16.641 --> 03:45:25.711]  If you want to read the truth about how Donald Trump got elected, you can go to the Infowars.com store and get your copy of The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump
[03:45:28.638 --> 03:45:33.201]  Orchestrated a revolution by none other than Roger Stone.
[03:45:33.762 --> 03:45:36.924]  You'll find no self-aggrandizement in this book.
[03:45:37.004 --> 03:45:40.046]  This is about how Donald Trump did it.
[03:45:40.566 --> 03:45:43.168]  And believe me, folks, I was there from the beginning.
[03:45:43.708 --> 03:45:45.469]  Donald Trump is his own strategist.
[03:45:46.010 --> 03:45:47.351]  He's his own speechwriter.
[03:45:47.751 --> 03:45:49.192]  He is his own pollster.
[03:45:49.552 --> 03:45:51.213]  He is his own strategist.
[03:45:51.914 --> 03:45:54.616]  And it is to him that the credit belongs.
[03:45:55.596 --> 03:45:58.858]  Let's go to Richard in New York.
[03:45:58.958 --> 03:46:00.598]  Richard, you have a question.
[03:46:02.579 --> 03:46:03.560]  Hi Roger, how are you?
[03:46:03.580 --> 03:46:15.165]  Roger, I loved you back when you were on CNN years ago, and also, this is a side note, when Mark Levine called you a thug, I said, thank God we have a thug on our side.
[03:46:15.805 --> 03:46:20.448]  So, thanks, it's really great to be on the line today with you.
[03:46:20.888 --> 03:46:23.069]  The question I have for you is, if
[03:46:24.366 --> 03:46:31.131]  The leftist Marxists in the elite media and in Washington do try to take the president down.
[03:46:32.352 --> 03:46:34.674]  And they succeed in taking him down.
[03:46:34.694 --> 03:46:38.417]  They think the American people will march on Washington.
[03:46:39.520 --> 03:46:40.941]  Yes, I actually do.
[03:46:41.001 --> 03:46:49.447]  You see, the difference is that in 1974, the last time we had a coup in this country, there was only one monolithic mainstream media.
[03:46:50.128 --> 03:46:56.773]  There was no way to get information out to the patriots, to those who had an alternative view of what was happening.
[03:46:57.433 --> 03:47:00.836]  Richard Nixon was removed from office because he was a peacemaker.
[03:47:01.616 --> 03:47:06.460]  Because he ended the war in Vietnam on a faster timetable than the Pentagon wanted.
[03:47:06.900 --> 03:47:08.962]  Because he opened the door to China.
[03:47:09.022 --> 03:47:13.706]  Because he reached a strategic arms limitation agreement with the Soviets.
[03:47:14.347 --> 03:47:15.928]  My God, the man was for peace.
[03:47:16.008 --> 03:47:16.749]  He had to go.
[03:47:17.369 --> 03:47:26.811]  Therefore, they took advantage of clumsy theatrics and a ham-handed effort to bug the Watergate by underlings in the President's re-election campaign.
[03:47:27.472 --> 03:47:36.934]  The CIA learned about this, infiltrated the operation, botched it purposely so that they were arrested, and it was used to take the President down.
[03:47:37.654 --> 03:47:43.418]  The reason that citizens who oppose this did not march is because they didn't know the backstory.
[03:47:43.718 --> 03:47:47.401]  They only knew the version that was being told to them by the mainstream media.
[03:47:48.241 --> 03:48:07.234]  Thanks to the existence of InfoWars, and Breitbart, and Daily Caller, and Town Hall, and Conservative Tribune, and so many others, Americans will know the real story, and we will march, and there will be a spasm in this country if they try to undo
[03:48:08.375 --> 03:48:08.975]  Roger, how you doing?
[03:48:31.445 --> 03:48:31.765]  Good.
[03:48:32.266 --> 03:48:33.686]  I just got a question for you.
[03:48:33.727 --> 03:48:35.127]  Nobody ever brings this up.
[03:48:35.207 --> 03:48:37.089]  I just want your opinion on something.
[03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:42.592]  We know since March 9th, 1933, we've been under military government.
[03:48:42.752 --> 03:48:46.395]  That's why FDR was the last president sworn in on March 4th.
[03:48:47.315 --> 03:48:49.517]  And it don't have to do with the 20th Amendment.
[03:48:49.537 --> 03:48:52.719]  We're under military government, have been ever since.
[03:48:53.079 --> 03:48:54.120]  You think Trump knows this?
[03:48:55.106 --> 03:49:04.252]  Well, I think President Trump is not a career politician, but I think he understands the dynamics of who's running the government.
[03:49:05.113 --> 03:49:10.096]  I hope he's aware of the fact that there is an effort to isolate him by the generals.
[03:49:10.196 --> 03:49:12.858]  I've written about this extensively.
[03:49:13.398 --> 03:49:16.400]  I put my faith in Donald Trump and the Trump doctrine.
[03:49:17.361 --> 03:49:21.644]  I believe in the end that he, when he has all of the information,
[03:49:22.324 --> 03:49:25.827]  He invariably makes the right decision.
[03:49:26.308 --> 03:49:37.978]  So this is really a question of not allowing him to be isolated in the Oval Office, cut off from his friends, cut off from his advisors, cut off from his key supporters.
[03:49:38.479 --> 03:49:44.444]  That is, I believe, what General Kelly and the military cabal around the President are seeking to do today.
[03:49:45.205 --> 03:50:04.518]  But having known Donald Trump for over 40 years, I can tell you, the first time he learns something that he wasn't told but should have been, something that he learns, the first time he learns something that he was purposely left in the dark on, there will be hell to pay.
[03:50:05.558 --> 03:50:07.400]  I'm Roger Stone, in for
[03:50:08.240 --> 03:50:11.562]  Alex Jones, delighted to take your calls today.
[03:50:11.602 --> 03:50:14.664]  It's a momentous day in American politics.
[03:50:14.744 --> 03:50:18.186]  It's an extraordinary day for the Trump administration.
[03:50:18.887 --> 03:50:19.487]  Take heart.
[03:50:20.207 --> 03:50:21.889]  Our president is on the job.
[03:50:22.369 --> 03:50:33.756]  We've had a million new jobs since he was elected, a rock record stock market, and America is on its way to being great again under Donald Trump.
[03:50:34.156 --> 03:50:36.719]  We appreciate your support here at InfoWars.
[03:50:36.759 --> 03:50:45.288]  We ask you to go to the InfoWars.com store to allow us to continue to be the tip of the spear in the fight for freedom.
[03:50:45.729 --> 03:50:48.372]  God bless you, victory or death.
[03:51:03.370 --> 03:51:10.663]  They're saying Trump won because of inherent racism when it was the left that ran the campaign on a race-based system.
[03:51:12.369 --> 03:51:24.574]  Yes, not only is the left tactically fascist, not only are they using the sort of tactics of the Nazis, but they also have the ideology of the Nazis.
[03:51:25.034 --> 03:51:30.977]  Let's remember that Nazism and fascism were both variants of socialism.
[03:51:31.217 --> 03:51:36.399]  The very word Nazi is putting together national and socialista.
[03:51:36.419 --> 03:51:38.120]  That's where we get the sound Nazi.
[03:51:38.960 --> 03:51:40.722]  Mussolini was a Marxist.
[03:51:40.882 --> 03:51:43.945]  He was the leader of the Italian Socialist Party.
[03:51:44.405 --> 03:51:46.427]  He was recognized to be on the left.
[03:51:46.527 --> 03:51:48.169]  He saw himself as on the left.
[03:51:48.609 --> 03:51:54.194]  When Mussolini came to power, Lenin sent him a telegram of congratulations.
[03:51:54.615 --> 03:51:54.935]  Why?
[03:51:55.375 --> 03:52:00.260]  Because Lenin recognized that Mussolini was a fellow revolutionary of the left.
[03:52:00.740 --> 03:52:14.843]  So, what an incredible sleight of hand in which these leftists, whose political platform reads like it's right out of the Democratic Party platform... And by the way, Dinesh, this is something... You're absolutely right.
[03:52:14.863 --> 03:52:18.204]  This is something that leftist universities say that we're lying about.
[03:52:18.244 --> 03:52:22.665]  And a real hot point from them because it's a fact the Nazis were National Socialists.
[03:52:23.065 --> 03:52:26.725]  It's a fact that he modeled himself after the fascistas in Italy.
[03:52:27.005 --> 03:52:28.346]  It's a fact they wore black.
[03:52:28.426 --> 03:52:29.726]  It's a fact they wore masks.
[03:52:30.006 --> 03:52:31.607]  It's a fact they beat up their opposition.
[03:52:32.007 --> 03:52:35.248]  It's a fact that Hitler then turned against Stalin.
[03:52:36.188 --> 03:52:42.770]  They admired each other back and forth because he was seen as a rival politically and a rival militarily.
[03:52:43.030 --> 03:52:48.672]  But they had an alliance for the first year of the war where they divided Poland amongst each other.
[03:52:48.772 --> 03:52:50.573]  So we had the Warsaw Pact.
[03:52:51.153 --> 03:53:09.919]  They hope that's not known, that they are authoritarian, and that socialism and fascism have different and left-right versions, and that it was the American left that backed Hitler early on because he was a vegetarian and a bunch of other issues, and he wanted planning of society.
[03:53:09.979 --> 03:53:14.620]  This is incontrovertible that the KKK was founded by the Democratic Party.
[03:53:14.980 --> 03:53:17.501]  It is incontrovertible that the Republicans
[03:53:18.001 --> 03:53:22.545]  Passed the Civil Rights Act and took, you know, that system away from them and they panic.
[03:53:22.925 --> 03:53:36.876]  It is incontrovertible that the power structure got scared of American Christians and American Republicans and Eisenhower and created this whole new strategy to get everybody to go, oh, you're going to be liberal?
[03:53:36.916 --> 03:53:38.057]  You're going to be anti-racist?
[03:53:38.457 --> 03:53:44.822]  We'll take it over and make it extreme, own it, then double cross you later and make everything race-based again.
[03:53:46.104 --> 03:53:50.554]  Once whites have been taught to bow down as long as you say something's for racial equality.
[03:53:50.794 --> 03:53:56.427]  So they're using our goodness, our bigness, our Christian Western ethos to then bring us down.
[03:54:16.622 --> 03:54:23.187]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:23.687 --> 03:54:26.570]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:54:30.911 --> 03:54:33.734]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:33.774 --> 03:54:36.737]  The hypocrisy of the left is stunning.
[03:54:37.538 --> 03:54:46.127]  On the one hand, they attack President Trump for his failure, on their view, to denounce violence.
[03:54:47.288 --> 03:54:53.393]  Most harshly, or I should say harshly enough, at the same time they're in the streets advocating violence.
[03:54:53.533 --> 03:55:05.203]  If you see Alex Jones today on video, you can see these punks on the streets of Seattle talking about the need for violence, advocating violence.
[03:55:05.763 --> 03:55:12.789]  The violence of the left is just as vile and wrong as the violence on the extreme right.
[03:55:13.449 --> 03:55:15.050]  We have one more call.
[03:55:15.090 --> 03:55:16.311]  I don't want to leave you hanging.
[03:55:16.391 --> 03:55:18.773]  So, Stevie from Massachusetts.
[03:55:19.033 --> 03:55:20.234]  Steve, what's on your mind?
[03:55:21.975 --> 03:55:22.955]  Oh, thanks, Roger.
[03:55:23.616 --> 03:55:24.356]  I'm actually a girl.
[03:55:25.257 --> 03:55:25.577]  Sorry.
[03:55:26.538 --> 03:55:29.079]  I read your column on the Daily Caller.
[03:55:30.040 --> 03:55:32.281]  It made me feel a bit better about Bannon's removal.
[03:55:32.321 --> 03:55:39.706]  It seems like kind of a justified, you know, you had some really good points there, but it still feels like a loss to have him
[03:55:40.444 --> 03:55:41.024]  I think so.
[03:55:56.840 --> 03:55:57.761]  You know, who would come in?
[03:55:58.021 --> 03:55:58.261]  Sure.
[03:55:58.401 --> 03:56:00.563]  Well, first of all, Stephen Miller's a very good man.
[03:56:01.064 --> 03:56:05.307]  But Scotty Nell Hughes, a woman, could certainly do this job.
[03:56:06.108 --> 03:56:13.374]  Ed Martin, who we saw earlier on the program, a key player in Donald Trump's election, could do that job.
[03:56:13.494 --> 03:56:14.215]  David Urban.
[03:56:14.815 --> 03:56:20.358]  Who ran the president's historic campaign in Pennsylvania could do that job.
[03:56:20.938 --> 03:56:26.582]  No one is indispensable in the Trump revolution other than Donald Trump himself.
[03:56:27.722 --> 03:56:30.123]  And perhaps that is the exact problem.
[03:56:30.564 --> 03:56:43.211]  This isn't about the aggrandizement or ego of Steve Bannon, but he seemed more interested in his White House title and his office and his desk and his place in the entourage
[03:56:43.891 --> 03:56:49.375]  Yet he was absent in so many of the key struggles within this administration.
[03:56:49.896 --> 03:57:04.727]  So I'm still optimistic that the Trump revolution will move forward, that we will talk about economic prosperity and growth while they talk about race and race-baiting, and that that is, in my opinion,
[03:57:05.767 --> 03:57:14.630]  The formula for not only victory in the 2018 elections, but the re-election of Trump and Pence in 2020.
[03:57:16.290 --> 03:57:25.193]  Bringing that matter up, now would be a superb time to go to the Infowars.com store to get your Trump-Pence 2020 t-shirt.
[03:57:25.713 --> 03:57:34.776]  Now, this t-shirt shows that your faith in Donald Trump has not been shaken by the phony narrative of the left over Charlottesville.
[03:57:35.897 --> 03:57:43.365]  This is a First Amendment opportunity to go to the store and show your support for the president.
[03:57:43.846 --> 03:57:49.832]  The other thing it does is it allows you to meet like-minded patriots when you're out sporting your t-shirt.
[03:57:50.433 --> 03:57:53.255]  So, folks, we are under siege here.
[03:57:53.755 --> 03:58:01.680]  The Amazon, Google, Twitter, Facebook monolith, the tech left is seeking to cut us off.
[03:58:01.780 --> 03:58:03.201]  We need your support.
[03:58:03.702 --> 03:58:08.665]  Go to the store now, buy one of these t-shirts, buy a hat, get in the revolution.
[03:58:09.645 --> 03:58:15.808]  And help us fight for freedom, free press, and the First Amendment.
[03:58:15.888 --> 03:58:16.648]  God bless you.
[03:58:17.008 --> 03:58:19.309]  Thank you for coming to InfoWars.com.
[03:58:19.369 --> 03:58:23.091]  It's my high privilege to sit in for Alex Jones today.
[03:58:23.691 --> 03:58:27.872]  We will win if we stay in the fight.
[03:58:28.012 --> 03:58:28.773]  God bless you.
[03:58:28.813 --> 03:58:31.714]  And as I said earlier, victory or death.
[03:58:45.774 --> 03:58:49.757]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.881 --> 03:58:55.462]  You cannot beat these deals.
[03:58:55.502 --> 03:58:57.464]  These are our all-time best deals.
[03:58:57.524 --> 03:58:58.965]  Silver Bullet, Colloil Silver, 66% off.
