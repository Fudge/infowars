[00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.775]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:16.897]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:34.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, Cy Hirst, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, a man credited more than anybody of ending the Vietnam War, even more so than Walter Cronkite or Mr. Ellsberg,
[00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:41.300]  Cy Hirsch, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, has come out.
[00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:51.903]  In a shock bombshell interview that's on Infowars.com, there's a total blackout on this news, and said he talked directly to intelligence sources.
[00:00:51.923 --> 00:01:00.344]  We know one of them was the British ambassador, as well as folks at the highest levels of US intel, that Seth Rich was the leaker.
[00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:02.425]  It was not a Russian hack.
[00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:04.165]  That's Cy Hirsch.
[00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.405]  There's a total blackout on this news.
[00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:09.406]  We're going to break it in the next segment.
[00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:10.627]  This is huge.
[00:01:11.347 --> 00:01:16.871]  Meanwhile, Google, YouTube and others have launched massive censorship that started two days ago.
[00:01:17.592 --> 00:01:23.176]  Google and YouTube have banned a professor who refused to use gender-neutral pronouns in Canada.
[00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:24.277]  It's happening.
[00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.718]  Here's Paul Watson reporting.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.221]  YouTube says it will fight extremist content by censoring controversial videos.
[00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:34.222]  Who are they teaming up with to oversee this new program?
[00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:38.183]  Must be someone non-partisan, trustworthy, credible.
[00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:43.284]  A group that clearly knows the difference between free speech and violent hate speech.
[00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:43.884]  Right?
[00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:46.845]  It's the Anti-Defamation League, the ADL.
[00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:47.225]  Oh!
[00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:53.742]  But wait, I mean, surely YouTube wouldn't just hand power to those who would easily abuse it?
[00:01:53.802 --> 00:01:55.544]  This is a serious organization.
[00:01:55.604 --> 00:01:59.228]  The ADL's bar for hate speech must be pretty high, right?
[00:01:59.308 --> 00:01:59.909]  I mean, what is it?
[00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.430]  Advocating for genocide?
[00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.232]  Calling for violence against Jews?
[00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:06.316]  Oh, they literally think a cartoon frog is hate speech.
[00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:08.096]  That's how low the bar is.
[00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:19.140]  The ADL put the grandson of a survivor of the Nazi occupation on a list alongside actual neo-Nazis and white supremacists, simply because he's a conservative.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.741]  They also listed a bunch of other conservatives next to actual neo-Nazis.
[00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:29.883]  Oh, but they're the impartial, rational, neutral outfit that's now going to thwart police YouTube.
[00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:31.564]  They're not partisan at all!
[00:02:31.704 --> 00:02:43.971]  So a group whose entire existence and millions of dollars in funding every year relies on fanning hysteria over hate speech is now being given the power by YouTube to patrol hate speech.
[00:02:44.152 --> 00:02:46.633]  Gee, what could possibly go wrong?
[00:02:46.753 --> 00:02:49.495]  Who else is working with YouTube to patrol hate speech?
[00:02:49.595 --> 00:02:56.119]  The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a group that runs a program on far-right extremism in coordination with
[00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.660]  The Swedish government.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:06.246]  Oh, you mean the same Swedish government that put 14,000 people, most of them conservative commentators, on a Twitter hate speech block list.
[00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:14.793]  The same Swedish government that put PewDiePie, a dude whose content consists mostly of him playing video games, on that same hate speech block list.
[00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:20.417]  A government that thinks posting factual statistics about the link between migrants and violent crime
[00:03:20.777 --> 00:03:22.139]  Is an act of hate speech?
[00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.402]  What could possibly go wrong?
[00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:28.406]  Who else gets to decide what is and isn't hate speech on YouTube?
[00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:34.294]  The No Hate Speech Movement, a group that says websites that criticize Islam are hate speech.
[00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:40.341]  A group that says the President of the United States should be banned from Twitter for hate speech.
[00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:42.903]  Yeah, that bar still seems pretty low, doesn't it?
[00:03:42.963 --> 00:03:47.346]  But hey, I guess YouTube are just following the example of Twitter and Facebook.
[00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:55.511]  When Twitter wanted to crack down on abuse and harassment, they teamed up with feminists who think telling them they suck is abuse and harassment.
[00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:56.752]  Everything is sexist.
[00:03:57.012 --> 00:03:57.953]  Everything is racist.
[00:03:58.153 --> 00:03:59.114]  Everything is homophobic.
[00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:02.037]  Facebook wanted to crack down on fake news.
[00:04:02.237 --> 00:04:11.348]  They teamed up with Snopes, a credible, independent outlet that isn't left of Stalin and doesn't embezzle money to spend on luxury vacations and prostitutes.
[00:04:11.488 --> 00:04:16.474]  Oh, but don't worry, because YouTube says they're not going to censor controversial videos.
[00:04:16.494 --> 00:04:20.119]  They're just going to hide them, make sure they can't appear in the recommended bar.
[00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.040]  Be liked or commented on.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.761]  But they're not censoring them, honest.
[00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:24.661]  Let's get real.
[00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:29.063]  In the context of politics, the right has completely taken over YouTube.
[00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:31.764]  Even Vice.com had to admit it.
[00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:34.006]  The adpocalypse was only the beginning.
[00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:40.008]  Unless we bitch and moan about this over and over again, this is the start of the purge.
[00:04:40.088 --> 00:04:43.370]  And even if you're not a conservative, you should still be alarmed.
[00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.372]  They're going after anyone who isn't advertiser friendly.
[00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:54.857]  Which is basically anyone outside the limits of the narrow consensus of opinion that they subjectively define.
[00:04:54.957 --> 00:04:59.139]  Maybe we have allies within the company that can put a stop to this.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.122]  But unless we fight back, this is the beginning of the end.
[00:05:03.422 --> 00:05:10.327]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:14.810]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
[00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.313]  And it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[00:05:20.373 --> 00:05:23.375]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[00:05:23.596 --> 00:05:24.816]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:32.722]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:45.672]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[00:05:45.853 --> 00:05:53.219]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWars Life family, true whey protein from InfoWars Life.
[00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:59.484]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high-quality organic conditions.
[00:06:00.044 --> 00:06:06.790]  Our True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life contains a whopping 20 grams of protein per serving.
[00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.476]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:20.921]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies
[00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:27.267]  To bring you a super high quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[00:06:27.767 --> 00:06:35.335]  That way you get the benefits and the taste of high quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[00:06:35.655 --> 00:06:38.158]  Doing our research, one thing continued to really stand out.
[00:06:38.718 --> 00:06:47.385]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[00:06:47.786 --> 00:06:48.606]  That is essential.
[00:06:48.987 --> 00:06:53.290]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:56.233]  This is the very best whey that we were able to bring to market.
[00:06:56.593 --> 00:06:58.294]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[00:06:58.395 --> 00:07:00.036]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.
[00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:03.459]  It is true whey from mfoldwarslife.com.
[00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.480]  After four years of research,
[00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:09.834]  The next big game changer has arrived.
[00:07:10.615 --> 00:07:14.016]  Z-Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:15.957]  It's made in the USA.
[00:07:16.497 --> 00:07:24.800]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the Infowar.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.141]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:28.421]  We're changing the world.
[00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:32.563]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:36.593 --> 00:07:39.599]  We accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:44.368]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.853]  This is the Info War.
[00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:04.758]  Liberals now are all over the news.
[00:08:04.938 --> 00:08:10.144]  They're the newest, biggest group buying guns, saying, I'm preparing for civil war with the right-wingers.
[00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:12.527]  Thank God you just joined us and didn't know it.
[00:08:12.948 --> 00:08:15.571]  The Second Amendment is for a tyrannous government.
[00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:20.397]  A sleeping giant that is humanity!
[00:08:31.752 --> 00:08:33.914]  You won't stand up against tyranny, you'll only be a slave.
[00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:38.999]  If you're sad and bullied, they will push you around and make you their slave.
[00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:39.880]  Become men again!
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.121]  Become women again!
[00:08:41.161 --> 00:08:42.202]  Stand up!
[00:08:42.283 --> 00:08:44.605]  And tell the New World Order!
[00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:48.188]  You can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom!
[00:08:48.209 --> 00:08:50.691]  What we are looking at is good and evil.
[00:08:51.071 --> 00:08:56.556]  As for the people above you that are inviting you into their New World Order, they're slaves.
[00:08:56.996 --> 00:08:58.057]  They've sold out to it.
[00:08:58.097 --> 00:08:59.398]  They're blind.
[00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:00.239]  They're cowards.
[00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:01.560]  You don't want to be part of them.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.403]  Like Patrick Henry said, forget you are our brethren.
[00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:05.664]  Go from us in peace.
[00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:08.646]  Crouch down and lift the hand that feeds you.
[00:09:08.827 --> 00:09:11.569]  Let your chain sit lightly upon you.
[00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.313]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:33.027]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:44.477]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on the second day of August 2017 on this Wednesday Worldwide Global Transmission.
[00:09:45.558 --> 00:09:53.064]  First off, out of the gates, two-time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Cy Hirsch has already written
[00:09:54.238 --> 00:09:56.280]  Months ago that he talked to U.S.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:02.805]  intelligence and a top British ambassador who have actually met with high-level U.S.
[00:10:02.885 --> 00:10:09.410]  intelligence officers as well that have confirmed that Seth Rich was the leaker to WikiLeaks.
[00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:18.597]  We have Julian Assange publicly, within a week of Seth Rich being gunned down, shot in the back.
[00:10:19.474 --> 00:10:27.759]  Saying that they don't ever give up sources but that basically Seth Rich was their source and it should be investigated along those lines.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:40.786]  We now have intel coming out that you have these Islamic brothers from Pakistan in control of Democratic Party servers and that Seth Rich was reportedly that night at a party with them.
[00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:46.590]  You have Debbie Wasserman Schultz threatening the DC police that she is over
[00:10:47.495 --> 00:10:52.240]  As a representative of that area, saying, I'll cut your funding if you don't get back their laptops.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.025]  And then you have them in the news saying, don't ever question Seth Rich's murder.
[00:10:57.725 --> 00:11:00.328]  Don't look at it or we'll basically have somebody sue you.
[00:11:01.749 --> 00:11:03.611]  Well, this is Cy Hirsch, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:05.093 --> 00:11:06.554]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[00:11:09.838 --> 00:11:22.967]  The video and audio is on Infowars.com, and there is a total MSM blackout on two-time Pulitzer Prize winning author, who also exposed that ISIS and Al Qaeda were being run by Obama.
[00:11:23.227 --> 00:11:24.368]  By the way, he's a liberal.
[00:11:25.028 --> 00:11:26.289]  A classical liberal.
[00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:29.291]  But he has a conscience.
[00:11:30.032 --> 00:11:34.535]  He's credited with ending the Vietnam War with his stories, on the My Lai Massacre, you name it.
[00:11:35.998 --> 00:11:38.701]  The guy that spurred Walter Cronkite to say the war was unwinnable.
[00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:40.383]  Because it wasn't meant to be won.
[00:11:41.664 --> 00:11:46.690]  Media completely ignores bombshell Seymour Hersh revelations on Seth Ridge.
[00:11:47.091 --> 00:11:49.593]  Not a single MSN outlet has covered the story.
[00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:56.681]  The audio tape obtained by Big League Politics, Hersh says he saw an FBI report linked
[00:11:57.699 --> 00:12:05.925]  Leaked to him by an insider which confirms that Rich had contacted WikiLeaks with sample emails from DNC Leaker and asked for payment for the full data dump.
[00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.607]  And it goes on from there.
[00:12:08.988 --> 00:12:11.730]  And he has multiple ambassadors telling him the same thing.
[00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.853]  One of these ambassadors has gone public to say he met with U.S.
[00:12:15.893 --> 00:12:22.258]  intelligence and they showed him the files that Rich was reportedly out there trying to sell the data.
[00:12:24.359 --> 00:12:25.320]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:12:27.142 --> 00:12:28.223]  Well, they don't want you to hear it.
[00:12:28.343 --> 00:12:29.204]  We've had to bleep it.
[00:12:29.304 --> 00:12:32.086]  But this is the candid recording of Cy Hirsch.
[00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:36.389]  Here is that report.
[00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.672]  What about the kid?
[00:12:39.832 --> 00:12:47.798]  I'll tell you what I know.
[00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:54.947]  Well, I know it comes off an FBI report.
[00:12:54.967 --> 00:12:55.567]  Don't ask me how.
[00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:56.307]  You can figure out.
[00:12:56.327 --> 00:12:57.127]  I've been around long enough.
[00:12:58.768 --> 00:13:00.468]  The kid gets... I don't think he was murdered.
[00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:02.829]  I don't think he was murdered because of what he knew.
[00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:04.369]  The kid's a nice boy, 27.
[00:13:04.489 --> 00:13:07.090]  He was not an IT expert, but he learned stuff.
[00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.231]  He was a data programmer, but he learned stuff.
[00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:12.012]  And so he's living on one street.
[00:13:12.352 --> 00:13:15.033]  He's living in a very rough neighborhood.
[00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:19.654]  And in the exact area where he lived, there have been about 10... I'm sure you know all this.
[00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:22.855]  There have been about 8 or 9 or 10 violent robberies.
[00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:34.666]  Most of them with somebody brandishing a gun, and if they hit his hand, I'm telling you, I'm sure you know, his hands were marked up, the cops concluded he fought off the people, tried to run and they shot him twice in the back with a .22, small caliber.
[00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:38.507]  And then the kids that did it ran, they got scared, didn't take his wallet, okay.
[00:13:38.707 --> 00:13:43.428]  So what the cops do then, and here's what nobody knows, what I'm telling you, maybe you know something about it.
[00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.589]  When you have a death like that, these
[00:13:48.817 --> 00:13:49.418]  I don't know.
[00:14:10.552 --> 00:14:11.313]  I think so.
[00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:32.883]  The Washington field office is a hot unit.
[00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:39.109]  The guy running the Washington field office, he's like, he's like, you know, he's like a three star at an army base.
[00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:40.110]  He's ready looking for four.
[00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:40.831]  You know what I mean?
[00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:42.633]  He's going to go with a top job.
[00:14:42.973 --> 00:14:45.155]  There's a cyber unit there that's excellent.
[00:14:46.356 --> 00:14:55.405]  What you get in a warrant, the public information you get in a warrant doesn't include, it does not include
[00:14:56.065 --> 00:14:56.525]  I think?
[00:15:20.157 --> 00:15:24.706]  He makes, first of all, you have to know, you have to know some basic facts.
[00:15:24.826 --> 00:15:28.353]  One of the basic facts is that there's no DMC of Podesta email.
[00:15:36.048 --> 00:15:45.412]  And so this, so what the report says that sometime in late spring, we're talking about June, you know, summer's in June 21st.
[00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:51.575]  Late spring would be after, I presume, I don't know, I just hear it says late spring, early summer.
[00:15:51.595 --> 00:15:53.496]  And he makes contact with WikiLeaks.
[00:15:54.776 --> 00:15:56.997]  That's in his computer, and he makes contact.
[00:15:57.277 --> 00:16:01.259]  Now, I have to be careful because I don't,
[00:16:06.212 --> 00:16:11.094]  You know, I've been... He said, by the way, when I'm in London, I always get a message, come see me at the Ecuadorian Embassy.
[00:16:11.114 --> 00:16:12.695]  I said, there's no f***ing way I'm going there.
[00:16:12.715 --> 00:16:15.656]  I've got enough trouble without getting photographed by every s*** made.
[00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:17.497]  He's under total surveillance by everybody.
[00:16:17.997 --> 00:16:21.199]  And, but anyway, they found what he had done.
[00:16:21.219 --> 00:16:27.641]  He had submitted a series of documents of emails, of juicy emails from the DNC.
[00:16:27.762 --> 00:16:32.864]  And, you know, by the way, all this s*** about the DNC, um, you know,
[00:16:34.085 --> 00:16:34.645]  Was it hacked?
[00:16:34.665 --> 00:16:35.306]  It wasn't hacked.
[00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:40.167]  But whatever happened, the Democrats themselves wrote this s**t, you know what I mean?
[00:16:40.447 --> 00:16:48.771]  All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, you know, I'm sure dozens, of emails, and said, I want money.
[00:16:51.952 --> 00:16:54.953]  That later, Ricky Leakes did get the password.
[00:16:54.993 --> 00:16:58.574]  He had a Dropbox, a protected Dropbox, which isn't hard to do.
[00:16:59.215 --> 00:17:01.015]  I mean, you don't have to be a wiz at IT with it.
[00:17:01.055 --> 00:17:02.736]  You know, he was certainly, you know, not a dumb kid.
[00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:05.718]  I don't think so.
[00:17:29.804 --> 00:17:30.164]  Okay.
[00:17:30.965 --> 00:17:31.806]  I don't know what that means.
[00:17:32.186 --> 00:17:35.369]  I don't know what he was... Anyway, but Richie Lee's got access.
[00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:40.352]  And before he was killed, I can tell you right now, Brennan's an a**hole.
[00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:41.854]  I've known all these people for years.
[00:17:41.954 --> 00:17:44.536]  Klepper's sort of a bitter guy, but now rocket scientist.
[00:17:44.576 --> 00:17:46.217]  The NSA guy's a f***ing moron.
[00:17:46.878 --> 00:17:55.985]  And they all, you know, the trouble with all those guys is that the only way they're going to make it to a board or two and get, you know, hired by SAI is he's delivered some fantastic contracts.
[00:17:56.265 --> 00:17:57.206]  Is this who he's stayed in?
[00:17:58.129 --> 00:17:58.909]  With Trump, they're gone.
[00:17:58.929 --> 00:17:59.490]  You know, they're done.
[00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.750]  They're going to live on their pension.
[00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:01.490]  They're not going to make it.
[00:18:02.031 --> 00:18:05.172]  And I got to tell you, guys in that job, they don't want to live on their pension.
[00:18:05.192 --> 00:18:07.433]  They want to be on board like their president.
[00:18:07.533 --> 00:18:09.093]  Make $600,000 with going to four businesses.
[00:18:09.694 --> 00:18:12.975]  I have somebody, I have somebody on the inside.
[00:18:12.995 --> 00:18:14.916]  You know, I've been around a long time and I write a lot of stuff.
[00:18:14.936 --> 00:18:18.277]  I have somebody inside who will go and read a file for me.
[00:18:18.877 --> 00:18:21.358]  This person is unbelievably accurate and careful.
[00:18:21.378 --> 00:18:22.779]  He's a very high-level guy.
[00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:23.739]  He'll do a favor.
[00:18:23.899 --> 00:18:25.880]  You're just going to have to trust me.
[00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:27.741]  I have
[00:18:28.683 --> 00:18:28.763]  Okay.
[00:18:48.087 --> 00:18:55.093]  We're telling the press that we even know who in the GRU, the Russian Military Intelligence Service, leads it.
[00:18:55.173 --> 00:19:05.042]  I mean, all bulls**t. I worked at the New York Times for f**king years, and show the f**k the New York Times that they have smart guys, but they're totally beholden on sources.
[00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:06.580]  I don't think so.
[00:19:30.401 --> 00:19:36.649]  There's Cy Hirsch, the greatest living journalist, and he likes Trump, just like the Pauls like Trump.
[00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.194]  Any real intellectual, like Julian Assange, likes Trump.
[00:19:40.895 --> 00:19:45.562]  Anybody who's smart, anybody who has the facts, cannot believe how good he is.
[00:19:46.912 --> 00:19:49.455]  He's so real, though, he's wild.
[00:19:50.176 --> 00:19:50.496]  It's true.
[00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:55.682]  I mean, he is the President of the United States, and he is on the deck, and he is in charge.
[00:19:56.202 --> 00:19:57.403]  And the elite are scared.
[00:19:58.284 --> 00:20:00.647]  Because they don't know what he's going to do to them, because they're such criminals.
[00:20:01.248 --> 00:20:01.768]  We'll be back.
[00:20:01.968 --> 00:20:03.030]  That was Bombshell Info.
[00:20:11.089 --> 00:20:15.193]  Jones is a charismatic performer who gets charged up on a regular basis.
[00:20:15.233 --> 00:20:16.154]  They call that crazy.
[00:20:16.194 --> 00:20:17.035]  That's not crazy.
[00:20:17.235 --> 00:20:21.078]  That's my will, my human spirit saying crush those that would hurt the innocent.
[00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:22.380]  Go after the enemy.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.941]  Build a civilization.
[00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:24.722]  Be honorable.
[00:20:25.402 --> 00:20:26.824]  Crush the snakes under your feet.
[00:20:27.064 --> 00:20:28.686]  People want legitimacy.
[00:20:28.766 --> 00:20:29.767]  They want real.
[00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:38.935]  Two-thirds of his funding reportedly comes from selling his products, which he sells on his site under his Infowars Life brand.
[00:20:39.175 --> 00:20:42.177]  Particularly, vitamins and nutraceuticals.
[00:20:42.537 --> 00:20:43.498]  A whole bunch!
[00:20:43.938 --> 00:20:45.879]  Now, let me break them down for you.
[00:20:45.939 --> 00:20:57.125]  There is a Super Male Vitality, a Super Female Vitality, Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee, Lung Cleanse, Brain Force Plus, something called DNA Force that costs $120 a bottle,
[00:20:59.286 --> 00:21:06.548]  And Child Ease, a herbal blend which, according to InfoWars, is designed to soothe the mind and bodies of children.
[00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:18.271]  And then there is Caveman True Paleo Formula with Bone Broth, a chocolate-flavoured drink mix made from bee pollen, stevia and the dust of chicken skeletons.
[00:21:18.891 --> 00:21:24.893]  Now, according to InfoWars, it is one of the most popular new health trends in the world today.
[00:21:25.513 --> 00:21:27.914]  And if you have never gone shopping on InfoWars,
[00:21:28.254 --> 00:21:40.682]  You are in for a treat, because there's the kind of survival gear that you would expect, alongside more surprising items like organic shampoo, body wash, and deodorants, as well as products like Combat One Tactical Bath Wipes.
[00:21:41.242 --> 00:21:46.045]  He does have a medical expert who consults on many of his supplements, Dr. Edward Groot III.
[00:21:46.105 --> 00:21:48.367]  Because the media makes fun of you and says that you're an idiot.
[00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:53.010]  He looks like a fifth year senior at the University of Falling Off a Surfboard.
[00:21:54.224 --> 00:21:54.664]  That's right.
[00:21:54.684 --> 00:21:56.825]  I mean, literally, they say we cannot sell coffee.
[00:21:56.885 --> 00:21:57.406]  It's a fraud.
[00:21:57.906 --> 00:21:59.967]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[00:22:00.287 --> 00:22:01.408]  Maybe you've had back pain before.
[00:22:01.428 --> 00:22:02.708]  Maybe you've had nerves that were cut off.
[00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:04.709]  This creates tingling.
[00:22:04.809 --> 00:22:06.430]  A lot of people have their feeling come back.
[00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.491]  I'm not going to make claims.
[00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:08.751]  This research is true.
[00:22:09.732 --> 00:22:11.533]  Organically based bio PQQ.
[00:22:11.613 --> 00:22:13.854]  And you can only find its ingredients in comets.
[00:22:14.734 --> 00:22:15.795]  Oh, and blueberries.
[00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:23.953]  His products are different than the ones you can find in stores.
[00:22:24.113 --> 00:22:28.076]  It is absolutely in the crystalline form, the strongest, you absorb it.
[00:22:28.536 --> 00:22:32.939]  So, folks, don't go out to the store and get iodine and say, one of the big chains, it'll kill you.
[00:22:33.659 --> 00:22:34.620]  Wow!
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.463]  I honestly did not know that you could imply your competition kills people.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:45.582]  We sell five different brands of the very best water filtration systems out there.
[00:22:45.602 --> 00:22:46.302]  They're amazing.
[00:22:46.342 --> 00:22:51.384]  They cut out 99.99% of the glyphosate, the herbicides, the pesticides, the fluoride.
[00:22:51.524 --> 00:22:55.125]  Jones is talking about the globalists systematically feminizing us.
[00:22:55.285 --> 00:22:59.807]  Chemicals were being placed in the water to feminize society and reduce the population.
[00:22:59.907 --> 00:23:02.988]  His products are marked up just enough to keep his business going.
[00:23:03.328 --> 00:23:05.229]  Well, the money that's made is pretty much put back into things.
[00:23:05.729 --> 00:23:12.335]  In fact, as he frequently tells his audience, he needs them to buy more to keep his truth-telling crusade solvent and growing.
[00:23:13.115 --> 00:23:16.218]  We need to fund ourselves, and we fund ourselves by you buying the products.
[00:23:16.258 --> 00:23:20.542]  We're at a shortfall now because of the massive sustained economic attacks we're under.
[00:23:20.702 --> 00:23:22.503]  I could have sponsors every segment.
[00:23:22.644 --> 00:23:23.164]  I don't do it.
[00:23:23.544 --> 00:23:24.725]  I plug enough to fund things.
[00:23:24.745 --> 00:23:25.486]  He even has a link.
[00:23:25.506 --> 00:23:25.806]  Exactly!
[00:23:25.846 --> 00:23:29.469]  It's like an NPR pledge drive for people who hate NPR.
[00:23:29.489 --> 00:23:31.950]  Why not pick up a Bill Clinton rape whistle?
[00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:38.114]  Which, according to Infowars, should be used to let Bill know you're in the crowd and that you know the truth.
[00:23:38.134 --> 00:23:39.115]  That truth, by the way,
[00:23:55.271 --> 00:24:03.884]  Nobody can dispute the fact that we... And by the way, our order came with a free 9-11 with an inside job bumper sticker.
[00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:35.852]  Think about the magnitude of this information.
[00:24:36.673 --> 00:24:37.673]  Seymour Hersh.
[00:24:38.213 --> 00:24:39.914]  Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner.
[00:24:40.574 --> 00:24:43.275]  The most famous living American journalist.
[00:24:44.215 --> 00:24:46.476]  He's the most famous journalist in the last hundred years.
[00:24:46.616 --> 00:24:47.657]  Totally documented.
[00:24:48.317 --> 00:24:51.918]  Coming out in a new report saying he talked to high-level U.S.
[00:24:51.958 --> 00:24:54.218]  government officials, ambassadors, you name it.
[00:24:54.478 --> 00:24:56.139]  They were watching Seth Rich.
[00:24:56.679 --> 00:24:59.479]  They were trying to get into the DNC systems.
[00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:01.100]  The DNC hadn't let them in.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.980]  They knew it was being penetrated.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.361]  They were watching Seth Rich, trying to sell the data to WikiLeaks.
[00:25:07.861 --> 00:25:10.862]  And you have WikiLeaks saying, right after he got shot in the back,
[00:25:11.542 --> 00:25:12.963]  That yes, he was their source.
[00:25:13.343 --> 00:25:17.224]  Now we have Sy Hersh confirming all of it.
[00:25:17.524 --> 00:25:24.907]  We have the identity of the DNC leaker, and it's not a Russian, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:27.528 --> 00:25:34.931]  Here is Julian Assange, from right after it happened, saying, I investigated both presidential candidates, and only Clinton has ties to Russia.
[00:25:35.171 --> 00:25:35.531]  And then,
[00:25:36.604 --> 00:25:41.728]  You actually look at who did the uranium deal, who got the $100 million for the bank deal, who met with Putin in secret.
[00:25:42.008 --> 00:25:53.057]  Who had Mueller take illegal uranium samples to a tarmac to meet with the Russians in Europe for the Clintons?
[00:25:54.858 --> 00:25:57.280]  Who can make this up?
[00:25:58.834 --> 00:26:07.396]  Hillary used the State Department as a whole parallel government, sometimes even against Obama's policies and other globalist policies, running her own system.
[00:26:07.616 --> 00:26:09.456]  She was co-president for eight years with Bill.
[00:26:10.116 --> 00:26:12.077]  She was co-president for eight years with Obama.
[00:26:12.597 --> 00:26:14.437]  And that's why the deep state's so arrogant.
[00:26:14.637 --> 00:26:20.779]  You've got all these different factions doing whatever they want, and nobody looking out for the American people.
[00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:21.939]  And here comes Trump.
[00:26:23.137 --> 00:26:24.359]  We're going to have bids again.
[00:26:24.379 --> 00:26:26.562]  We're going to actually cut taxes.
[00:26:26.582 --> 00:26:28.205]  We're actually going to secure the border.
[00:26:28.225 --> 00:26:30.509]  We're actually going to do the right thing for this country.
[00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:32.151]  We're actually going to get the stock market boosted.
[00:26:32.171 --> 00:26:35.016]  We're actually going to bring back a thousand plus companies that are already here.
[00:26:36.445 --> 00:26:40.388]  And the Federal Reserve, private, independent from government, its own fourth branch.
[00:26:41.048 --> 00:26:43.210]  That's the former head of the Federal Reserve's own words.
[00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.052]  Congress and the President can do nothing, they claim.
[00:26:46.533 --> 00:26:51.516]  Well, Congress should actually repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and we're close to doing it, so we can do something.
[00:26:51.817 --> 00:26:58.522]  But they said they're above the law and have raised interest rates four times, they say, to stop the Trump recovery.
[00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:00.018]  And they cheer!
[00:27:00.338 --> 00:27:01.319]  Yay!
[00:27:01.739 --> 00:27:04.280]  The Rasmussen polls down to 38!
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.361]  Gallup's down to 34!
[00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:09.703]  Well, that's because Gallup isn't as fake as Rasmussen.
[00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:18.266]  Just like all those clips and all those news articles during the campaign, when Trump was 15, 20 points behind, then he won.
[00:27:18.647 --> 00:27:19.727]  It's called fake polls.
[00:27:19.967 --> 00:27:21.668]  That's coming up in the next segment, but here's Cy Hirsch.
[00:27:22.848 --> 00:27:23.929]  Here is Julian Assange.
[00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:35.762]  Hillary Clinton has done quite well strategically to try and draw connection between Trump and Russia because she has so many connections of her own.
[00:27:36.562 --> 00:27:40.687]  Now, my analysis of Trump and Russia
[00:27:41.287 --> 00:27:43.569]  Is that there is no substantial connection.
[00:27:44.349 --> 00:27:45.150]  Why do I say that?
[00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:54.837]  Well, because Trump was trying to invest in Russia before Putin in the 1990s, after Putin, in fact, nearly all the way up to the present moment.
[00:27:55.658 --> 00:27:56.738]  And he's had no success.
[00:27:57.359 --> 00:27:59.941]  He did not manage to build hotels and so on in Russia.
[00:27:59.981 --> 00:28:00.761]  So that shows how
[00:28:04.304 --> 00:28:07.266]  Insubstantial, his contacts are.
[00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:19.691]  There's an extremely well documented pattern of when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, those people, companies, governments, who wanted a decision by the Secretary of State in their favour,
[00:28:20.635 --> 00:28:28.239]  Making large donations to the Clinton Foundation or in some other cases business deals with the people around Hillary Clinton.
[00:28:28.779 --> 00:28:45.907]  Now one particular instance is the approval by Secretary Clinton of selling 20% of the US uranium reprocessing rights to a Russian company to be exported to Russia.
[00:28:47.046 --> 00:28:53.008]  So at that time, a large donation was made by those Russian interests to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:28:53.809 --> 00:29:00.251]  In addition, Clinton's campaign manager, Podesta, was on the board of a company called Jewel Unlimited.
[00:29:00.771 --> 00:29:09.995]  And Jewel Unlimited held some of these rights and received a $35 million investment from Russia.
[00:29:11.195 --> 00:29:12.576]  And there's a bunch of others as well.
[00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:15.957]  That's old news, but there's Assange telling the truth.
[00:29:17.992 --> 00:29:31.455]  Meanwhile, Trump has been bullied into signing the legislation for more sanctions against Russia today, and he's being basically bullied into troop increases, you name it, so he can prove he's not a Russian agent.
[00:29:32.864 --> 00:29:34.846]  He's not even supposed to talk to Putin at dinner.
[00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:36.007]  Or he's a Russian agent.
[00:29:36.347 --> 00:29:40.130]  It's one of the only areas that Trump has been manipulated into a corner.
[00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:43.313]  And notice it's only made them say he's more of a Russian agent.
[00:29:43.533 --> 00:29:44.674]  He could nuke Russia.
[00:29:45.215 --> 00:29:48.057]  He could slice baby Russians' necks and drink their blood.
[00:29:48.297 --> 00:29:51.200]  That wouldn't be enough for John McCain, the walking brain tumor.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.080]  We'll be back.
[00:29:52.101 --> 00:29:52.721]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.761 --> 00:29:53.682]  We're on the march.
[00:29:54.142 --> 00:29:55.764]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.684 --> 00:29:59.367]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.605 --> 00:30:09.507]  DNA Force is finally back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:31:34.065 --> 00:31:37.587]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:31:38.047 --> 00:31:44.090]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.292]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:50.694]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:50.874 --> 00:31:54.335]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:31:54.656 --> 00:31:55.116]  The left
[00:31:55.476 --> 00:31:56.396]  ...controls culture.
[00:31:56.437 --> 00:31:57.417]  They control art.
[00:31:57.477 --> 00:31:58.698]  They control entertainment.
[00:31:59.018 --> 00:32:06.101]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:32:06.141 --> 00:32:08.542]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:32:09.042 --> 00:32:12.884]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:32:12.944 --> 00:32:21.028]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:32:21.288 --> 00:32:23.969]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[00:32:24.369 --> 00:32:27.533]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:32:27.593 --> 00:32:29.295]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:32:29.455 --> 00:32:30.636]  It's available right now.
[00:32:30.937 --> 00:32:33.119]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.

[00:33:10.692 --> 00:33:16.902]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[00:33:17.363 --> 00:33:23.453]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[00:33:32.888 --> 00:33:36.773]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:37.654 --> 00:33:39.796]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:49.246 --> 00:33:53.972]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is what would have happened if Hillary would have been Madam President.
[00:33:55.871 --> 00:33:58.974]  You know, I ended up taking it home with me last night.
[00:33:59.014 --> 00:34:03.359]  I hadn't actually read the Madam President Newsweek from eight months ago.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:11.508]  We'd shown the cover and shown the news articles that day after the election that they actually even had some on store shelves that she was the president.
[00:34:12.128 --> 00:34:13.710]  Talk about fake news from Newsweek.
[00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:16.813]  But I actually read it last night and
[00:34:17.896 --> 00:34:20.638]  It is the richest comedy you've ever heard.
[00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:24.020]  It's how she beat him, what state she beat him in.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:36.526]  I mean, it shows how scripted the attempt to steal the election was, down to the six states she tried to steal, but the state officials caught Homeland Security breaking into.
[00:34:37.027 --> 00:34:39.848]  This thing is a roadmap to their fraud.
[00:34:40.689 --> 00:34:42.230]  It is amazing.
[00:34:43.083 --> 00:34:50.508]  So I'm going to shoot a special report on that little juicy in the next few days because it's a doozy.
[00:34:51.308 --> 00:34:57.973]  Sixty-something pages of pure, unadulterated, fake news, corporate fraud from Newsweek.
[00:34:58.673 --> 00:35:07.659]  You know, the same folks that say the case for rioting and cops deserve to die when they get shot in the back of the head pumping gas or pulling somebody over or changing a tire.
[00:35:08.279 --> 00:35:12.322]  And that I want violence and have told my listeners go out and quote
[00:35:13.618 --> 00:35:17.661]  Kill more liberals was the quote last week.
[00:35:19.182 --> 00:35:20.603]  But they don't show where I said it.
[00:35:20.663 --> 00:35:24.566]  They just have a fake quote that I said, go out and kill more liberals.
[00:35:24.646 --> 00:35:26.047]  No, I didn't say that.
[00:35:26.547 --> 00:35:27.768]  You said that Newsweek.
[00:35:28.048 --> 00:35:36.374]  What a pack of criminal scum, snot-nosed anti-American people that have had their foot on our neck forever.
[00:35:36.674 --> 00:35:41.398]  And now the sleeping giant is awake and they don't know what to do.
[00:35:42.699 --> 00:35:47.982]  So they got caught lying, so they just intensify the make-believe with a big cover story.
[00:35:48.002 --> 00:35:57.408]  There was a cover story on their website for two days that Alex Jones is trying to get a violent war going.
[00:35:57.848 --> 00:36:06.493]  No, we're kicking your traitorous, anti-American, globalist scum intellectually up the block and back down.
[00:36:06.933 --> 00:36:11.776]  We are stomping your little piggy faces into the ground.
[00:36:13.536 --> 00:36:14.917]  So, good luck.
[00:36:15.938 --> 00:36:16.879]  Good luck.
[00:36:20.642 --> 00:36:23.165]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:24.426]  Oh, Newsweek!
[00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:26.127]  Tell me about Madam President again?
[00:36:26.147 --> 00:36:36.717]  And what state she won, and how she won, and how Trump was so evil, and... Now that Hillary's won, we've got to mop up, you know, the dangerous right-wing groups and ban their speech?
[00:36:37.277 --> 00:36:38.318]  Oh-ho-ho-ho!
[00:36:38.718 --> 00:36:40.160]  Yes, we know about your whole plan.
[00:36:42.043 --> 00:36:43.984]  But it didn't go according to schedule.
[00:36:44.704 --> 00:36:45.745]  Now, here's the problem.
[00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.746]  They're manipulating the public with fake polls again.
[00:36:48.766 --> 00:36:49.506]  We're going to cover that.
[00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:50.747]  The latest on Obamacare.
[00:36:51.767 --> 00:36:55.849]  We've got a senator, another neocon, Jeff Flake.
[00:36:56.769 --> 00:36:59.490]  The last name certainly fits to the way he's acting.
[00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:02.331]  Saying he's proud to be a globalist.
[00:37:02.351 --> 00:37:06.093]  That means transferring your sovereignty to an international group.
[00:37:06.553 --> 00:37:07.473]  We're going to look at that.
[00:37:07.494 --> 00:37:10.975]  Senate Republicans slowly turning their backs on Trump.
[00:37:12.648 --> 00:37:13.229]  AP News.
[00:37:13.249 --> 00:37:14.730]  They're not slowly turning their backs.
[00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.473]  They always have been trying to slit his throat.
[00:37:18.794 --> 00:37:22.778]  Politically, they have to act like they're with him or they'll be removed from office.
[00:37:24.019 --> 00:37:26.761]  When Flake's running for office, he's a big nationalist and a patriot.
[00:37:26.781 --> 00:37:33.027]  But when he gets in, he's another establishment wannabe that gets off on being traitorous.
[00:37:33.768 --> 00:37:36.651]  He has that same weird, narcissist, bug-eyed
[00:37:38.732 --> 00:37:44.175]  Barracuda smile that all these people with their fake teeth and the rest of it have.
[00:37:44.315 --> 00:37:45.416]  What a joke!
[00:37:48.017 --> 00:37:54.301]  Meanwhile, back in the real world, media completely ignores bombshell Seymour Hersh revelations on Seth Rich.
[00:37:54.641 --> 00:37:59.644]  That's a powerful headline on Infowars.com, but not powerful enough.
[00:37:59.784 --> 00:38:06.108]  Its Pulitzer Prize winning journalist reveals the identity of the DNC leaker.
[00:38:08.393 --> 00:38:17.376]  And the only thing I disagree with, with Hirsch, is they're saying, well, you know, there was a high crime area in D.C., maybe he really got mugged, maybe he really got shot.
[00:38:17.696 --> 00:38:22.538]  That's the oldest way to kill somebody and make it look like it wasn't a hit, was to claim it was a botched robbery.
[00:38:23.698 --> 00:38:28.799]  And everybody knows that one of the favorite assassin tools is a .22 long rifle.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.221]  Doesn't make a big noise, put it up somebody's head and pull the trigger.
[00:38:34.605 --> 00:38:36.225]  It's basically like a silenced weapon.
[00:38:36.725 --> 00:38:38.826]  No such thing as a silencer, they really call them suppressors.
[00:38:39.786 --> 00:38:52.909]  But, that is a classic tool of assassination for over a hundred years by La Cosa Nostra, by Army Intelligence, and then by the CIA, is a .22 handgun.
[00:38:55.569 --> 00:38:56.249]  And that's a fact.
[00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:02.351]  A lot of folks like the Rugers as well because they contain not just the
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:11.266]  Report of out of the barrel, but also out of the cartridge where it actually detonates.
[00:39:12.728 --> 00:39:17.172]  Farther back in the gun, a cap detonating the powder and firing the projectile.
[00:39:17.673 --> 00:39:22.057]  I'm just telling you it's a well known assassination tool is a 22 very, very quiet.
[00:39:26.102 --> 00:39:26.282]  I mean,
[00:39:27.668 --> 00:39:30.289]  Ruger .22s are used in a lot of assassinations.
[00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:35.490]  Now, if you're inside a house and you don't care, it's a shotgun, because you don't get rifling off that.
[00:39:36.191 --> 00:39:38.491]  You just shoot somebody in the face with a double-aught buckshot.
[00:39:38.511 --> 00:39:45.733]  You should go ahead and shoot them in the chest for good measure, or you can, in the case of Gary Webb, just shoot him twice with a shotgun.
[00:39:46.534 --> 00:39:49.174]  But, see, he fought them, so they shot him in the side and in the head.
[00:39:49.615 --> 00:39:51.815]  But, I'm digressing.
[00:39:52.715 --> 00:39:54.216]  Let me just continue on with the news here.
[00:39:55.828 --> 00:40:06.933]  But regardless, he is the DNC leaker, and we have that from so many high-level sources, and that's why he's dead, and it's why they're so scared in the media and saying, do not investigate, do not look at this.
[00:40:07.234 --> 00:40:09.295]  They're basically saying Seth Rich didn't exist right now.
[00:40:12.096 --> 00:40:15.097]  They're ridiculing anybody that looks at it because they're so scared.
[00:40:16.158 --> 00:40:23.982]  Now before I plow into all this news that I just mentioned, and a lot more, we are ending the July specials on August 2nd.
[00:40:25.558 --> 00:40:32.022]  And I customarily end up going a few days over on sales because I'm kind of chief cook and bottle washer around here.
[00:40:32.042 --> 00:40:35.604]  I've got to look at what we've got in stock, what we can discount, what's popular.
[00:40:36.544 --> 00:40:44.208]  We do have some new specials coming out tomorrow, but they won't be as extensive, obviously, because this has been such a big sale, such a deep sale.
[00:40:44.588 --> 00:40:49.071]  The sale last month has been the biggest ever, the longest free shipping, you name it.
[00:40:49.391 --> 00:40:50.812]  The free shipping ends today.
[00:40:53.336 --> 00:40:59.608]  The 46% on MycoZx, the anti-fungal, anti-yeast, other part of the probiotic equation.
[00:41:00.148 --> 00:41:01.591]  That's the biggest discount ever on that.
[00:41:02.212 --> 00:41:03.635]  DNA 4 is 20% off.
[00:41:03.675 --> 00:41:05.578]  That's got to end today because it's about to sell out anyways.
[00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:09.330]  Alexa Pure Breeze, normally $219.
[00:41:09.591 --> 00:41:10.711]  Competitors are $400 to $600.
[00:41:10.851 --> 00:41:12.012]  It's $149.
[00:41:12.472 --> 00:41:15.034]  No one can beat that.
[00:41:15.114 --> 00:41:16.014]  Super high quality.
[00:41:16.375 --> 00:41:17.215]  Super high tech.
[00:41:17.275 --> 00:41:18.356]  Grabs the garbage out.
[00:41:18.996 --> 00:41:20.197]  Uses amazing systems.
[00:41:20.217 --> 00:41:20.197]  $149.
[00:41:20.237 --> 00:41:22.598]  You ought to buy a lot of these for your house.
[00:41:22.638 --> 00:41:27.021]  Because it does a big room, each one, but I've got four of them in my house, personally.
[00:41:28.222 --> 00:41:33.525]  I removed units that cost me $1,000 three years ago that are the same technology and aren't even as good.
[00:41:33.985 --> 00:41:35.206]  But again, that's miniaturization.
[00:41:36.803 --> 00:41:38.805]  When we first started selling these, the competition was $800 to $1,000.
[00:41:38.865 --> 00:41:40.767]  Now it's down to $400.
[00:41:40.847 --> 00:41:42.769]  And we're down to $149.
[00:41:42.809 --> 00:41:44.791]  Just, it is the best deal.
[00:41:45.251 --> 00:41:46.132]  Pro Pure Traveler.
[00:41:46.192 --> 00:41:48.214]  Amazing stainless steel gravity-fed system.
[00:41:48.734 --> 00:41:49.936]  Blows away the competition.
[00:41:51.297 --> 00:42:00.726]  All the best filters we carry, Alexa Pure, Pro-Pure, they're apples and oranges, they're good across the board, but Pro-Pure is excellent at $132, 30% off, you cannot beat it.
[00:42:01.106 --> 00:42:14.038]  Super Silver Special, the Colloidal Silver, Silver Bullet, Super Blue Toothpaste, it's so popular with colloidal silver and iodine, no fluoride, and a Power Toothbrush that has silver impregnated into the bristles, amazing.
[00:42:15.313 --> 00:42:18.022]  That is 50% off right now.
[00:42:18.744 --> 00:42:19.947]  Caveman Combo!
[00:42:20.268 --> 00:42:22.034]  This is what is being made fun of by...
[00:42:23.427 --> 00:42:28.471]  John Oliver, when everybody who's done any research knows bone broth for two or three years has been the hottest thing out there.
[00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:30.473]  It was always hot with grandma, always hot with mom.
[00:42:30.493 --> 00:42:34.517]  If you were sick, she'd cook the bones of the chicken into the chicken noodle soup.
[00:42:35.177 --> 00:42:46.847]  It's known, well this is the bones absolutely taken fresh and then pulverized and it's got all the trace minerals, all the stuff that's in the marrow and it tastes great!
[00:42:47.788 --> 00:42:48.849]  I challenge anyone.
[00:42:48.929 --> 00:42:51.711]  It tastes okay when it's just water.
[00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:53.373]  But who does stuff like that with water?
[00:42:53.793 --> 00:42:55.554]  Folks mix it with protein, with whey.
[00:42:55.854 --> 00:42:56.715]  They put in milk.
[00:42:58.216 --> 00:42:59.157]  It's amazing.
[00:42:59.337 --> 00:43:03.420]  It tastes like ice cream with milk.
[00:43:04.842 --> 00:43:07.644]  And then they take a clip of me drinking it when I did a demonstration on air.
[00:43:07.664 --> 00:43:10.666]  So I didn't know that the folks had just put milk in it.
[00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:13.408]  I'm like, that tastes even better in the full clip.
[00:43:13.448 --> 00:43:14.229]  I say, what'd you do?
[00:43:14.249 --> 00:43:16.391]  And he goes, oh, Buckley says I added milk.
[00:43:17.601 --> 00:43:20.323]  Yeah, it tastes, it's gone from tasting okay to really great.
[00:43:20.443 --> 00:43:20.783]  Wow.
[00:43:21.343 --> 00:43:25.625]  And so the fact that I was like savoring it and really going, why is this different?
[00:43:25.645 --> 00:43:27.186]  Because I'm honest with folks.
[00:43:27.266 --> 00:43:29.147]  I'll tell you, SuperMale tastes weird.
[00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:30.248]  It works though.
[00:43:31.649 --> 00:43:33.129]  Childe's tastes great.
[00:43:35.651 --> 00:43:43.435]  A lot of our products taste really great, but I mean, stuff like SuperMale, the iodine tastes kind of weird.
[00:43:45.134 --> 00:43:46.174]  Oh, and then he made fun of me.
[00:43:46.955 --> 00:43:53.757]  And he said that... I said, don't go get the random stuff at the store that's topical, eat a hole in your stomach and kill you.
[00:43:54.438 --> 00:43:54.918]  It can.
[00:43:55.278 --> 00:44:01.980]  You've got to go out and get this super high-grade, clean, unbound, properly certified iodine of a totally different type.
[00:44:02.621 --> 00:44:08.543]  And I love how they put a promo together that shows mainstream news saying, do not take store-bought iodine, it can kill you.
[00:44:09.443 --> 00:44:10.404]  Do the topical type.
[00:44:10.624 --> 00:44:13.645]  I mean, I'm just telling you what is a known fact.
[00:44:14.718 --> 00:44:16.559]  But again, they need to make it sound weird.
[00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:23.681]  Everybody knows about ox bone, beef bone, the marrow having the stem cells in it.
[00:44:25.202 --> 00:44:31.024]  Anybody who's smart, anybody from the country, anybody from Europe, especially, that's where bone broth's big over there.
[00:44:31.424 --> 00:44:33.625]  Everybody knows you're sick, you take bone broth.
[00:44:34.085 --> 00:44:41.488]  Everybody knows in weight loss, they do these bone broth juice fasts that are just in the craze for 20 years in Hollywood, because they actually work.
[00:44:42.614 --> 00:44:45.138]  So I go out and I research the hottest thing is bone broth.
[00:44:45.238 --> 00:44:46.680]  I find out there's hardly any competitors.
[00:44:46.941 --> 00:44:50.085]  I find out the stuff they've got is watered down.
[00:44:50.947 --> 00:44:55.414]  I set out with the top manufacturer in the company to put out the ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:44:57.014 --> 00:45:09.584]  It becomes the national bestseller, it is now the national bestseller of any bone broth product, and it's their job on HBO to make that sound weird and say that it's the dried dust of domesticated bird skeletons.
[00:45:10.245 --> 00:45:17.931]  He can technically say that because a chicken is a domesticated bird, but it sounds really weird like I'm killing parrots and putting them in a blender or something.
[00:45:20.242 --> 00:45:21.523]  Again, that's their job.
[00:45:21.803 --> 00:45:33.848]  Take something that is as wholesome as it gets, chicken noodle soup to the next level, basically, mixed with chaga mushroom, turmeric, bee pollen, all of it.
[00:45:34.928 --> 00:45:38.810]  They make it sound weird I'm selling coffee, just like D Magazine did.
[00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.910]  I'm a scammer.
[00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.711]  I'm claiming coffee's really good.
[00:45:43.312 --> 00:45:44.572]  They make fun of our toothpaste.
[00:45:45.813 --> 00:45:47.974]  By the way, the bubble gum, without the
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.563]  Peppermint and without the tea tree is in because it's a little too strong for kids.
[00:45:52.603 --> 00:45:54.124]  Our Super Blue is concentrated.
[00:45:54.164 --> 00:45:54.925]  It's a bestseller.
[00:45:55.165 --> 00:45:56.646]  Folks are reordering it at record numbers.
[00:45:56.666 --> 00:45:59.068]  It's super popular because it works so good.
[00:46:00.709 --> 00:46:04.633]  The bubble gum has been gone for, again, almost six months.
[00:46:05.694 --> 00:46:11.178]  We're trying to fix our supply issues, but we have to get in at the big national factory that makes Tom's of Maine and everybody else.
[00:46:11.618 --> 00:46:15.280]  And you gotta get the tubes in, it's gotta all be prepared, they gotta get the factory ready to run it.
[00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:20.404]  And then you get in the queue, and it's a hassle, but bubblegum.
[00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:22.962]  Natural flavor is now back.
[00:46:23.002 --> 00:46:23.582]  Kids love it.
[00:46:24.303 --> 00:46:25.904]  Bubblegum is now back available.
[00:46:26.364 --> 00:46:27.045]  4.7 stars.
[00:46:27.565 --> 00:46:28.346]  Does have the iodine.
[00:46:28.366 --> 00:46:29.206]  Does have the clental silver.
[00:46:29.226 --> 00:46:31.868]  But doesn't have the really strong peppermint in it.
[00:46:32.629 --> 00:46:34.170]  That even for adults, they say it's strong.
[00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.990]  It's concentrated!
[00:46:35.611 --> 00:46:36.912]  So that's back in stock now.
[00:46:36.952 --> 00:46:37.632]  That's discounted.
[00:46:38.673 --> 00:46:39.193]  Out of the gates.
[00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:42.215]  I guess it isn't discounted.
[00:46:42.235 --> 00:46:43.977]  I wanted to discount that 25%.
[00:46:44.037 --> 00:46:45.758]  So that just came back in yesterday.
[00:46:45.778 --> 00:46:47.259]  And we're going to add that to 25% off.
[00:46:47.279 --> 00:46:47.919]  And notice it's not.
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.380]  We're going to sell that for $9.95.
[00:46:51.226 --> 00:46:56.869]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, that's how you fund the operation, and the globalists hate it, but it's all ending today.
[00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:07.636]  The free shipping, all those specials, 50% off on the silver package, 66% off on the silver bullet, colloidal silver, the free shipping on top of it.
[00:47:08.116 --> 00:47:19.383]  Some of these items are lost liters, but I want you to experience how good they are, and I want you to get either the chocolate flavor or strawberry flavor of the Caveman, Ultimate Caveman, Ultimate Cave,
[00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:26.106]  Bone broth formula and I want you to try it with just water and taste okay.
[00:47:28.228 --> 00:47:34.554]  And I want you to try it with milk and a few ice cubes and tell me if it doesn't taste delicious.
[00:47:35.234 --> 00:47:39.999]  The issue is though a lot of folks are using it for weight loss because it's so filling.
[00:47:41.886 --> 00:47:48.491]  That's why some people now are actually whipping it up in a blender and then freezing it and eating it like, kind of like yogurt ice cream or something.
[00:47:48.811 --> 00:47:51.753]  I mean, in fact, we're going to do a whole, I'm doing a taste test.
[00:47:51.834 --> 00:48:05.324]  I think I'm going to go down the hike and bike trail with a whole setup and do a taste test of it versus Frosty's from someplace like Wendy's.
[00:48:05.664 --> 00:48:09.147]  Because I want to show people, we did a taste test with the Pro-Pure.
[00:48:10.168 --> 00:48:13.442]  Leanne did a few years ago down there right next to tap water.
[00:48:14.815 --> 00:48:18.237]  And everybody liked our filtered water over tap water.
[00:48:18.257 --> 00:48:20.858]  They're always saying tap water tastes so great, tap water is so good.
[00:48:21.078 --> 00:48:26.861]  You're insane if you're drinking tap water in most cities or even most small towns and most well water is contaminated.
[00:48:26.901 --> 00:48:27.481]  You're nuts!
[00:48:28.202 --> 00:48:34.325]  And he says I'm a kook for selling water filters to protect you from estrogen mimickers and chemicals in the water.
[00:48:34.885 --> 00:48:35.926]  Absolutely!
[00:48:36.166 --> 00:48:42.129]  I'm trying to make money to fund our operation while selling people things they need and that I personally use.
[00:48:42.409 --> 00:48:43.710]  Yes, that's what it's called.
[00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:45.512]  Symbiotic relationship.
[00:48:47.574 --> 00:48:53.760]  If I was a car dealer, I would go out and sell the cars that I personally like.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:49:01.867]  You know, do what you love, sell what you like, sell good products, sell products people get a great response off of.
[00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:06.531]  I want you to like it.
[00:49:07.072 --> 00:49:08.033]  Why would I put out
[00:49:09.784 --> 00:49:12.445]  A bone broth formula that tastes like crap.
[00:49:13.266 --> 00:49:20.570]  It took us over a year and a half, scores of different types to finally get a recipe that tasted okay.
[00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:22.651]  And I said on the full show, okay.
[00:49:22.871 --> 00:49:26.453]  He knows in that same video, I said it tastes okay without the milk.
[00:49:26.673 --> 00:49:27.894]  It tastes so much better with the milk.
[00:49:28.194 --> 00:49:31.556]  He knows that, but he misrepresented to you because he's a liar.
[00:49:32.256 --> 00:49:40.999]  That's why I haven't properly responded yet, because I'm going to show you what I fully said, just like with Megyn Kelly, and then I'm going to show you where he said I was a liar by editing it, because he's not even a liar.
[00:49:41.439 --> 00:49:43.680]  John Oliver is a facsimile.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.001]  He's like a computer program.
[00:49:47.242 --> 00:49:58.766]  He's a guy that comes in and looks ironic and looks nerdy for his nerd audience to make them feel less nerdy, and then he does little ironic faces and reads off a teleprompter written by, in some cases, over a hundred different contributors.
[00:49:59.614 --> 00:50:02.935]  It took him weeks to put together a 20-minute piece on me.
[00:50:03.355 --> 00:50:11.397]  Everything they threw at us, total lies, total fraud, total scams, total deception, upside-down inversion of reality, but it failed.
[00:50:11.877 --> 00:50:22.000]  Because all your fake polls and all your demonization pieces and all your misrepresenting what I've said and done only affects the most brain-dead, drooling morons that are still under your control.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:22.820]  But I digress.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:24.381]  The big sales in today.
[00:50:24.441 --> 00:50:25.421]  Thank you all for supporting us.
[00:50:25.701 --> 00:50:29.404]  But most importantly, pray for the broadcast and support our local affiliates.
[00:50:29.624 --> 00:50:30.844]  Support their local sponsors.
[00:50:30.864 --> 00:50:33.306]  Become a sponsor or tithe every month.
[00:50:34.246 --> 00:50:40.169]  The local radio station, send them $20, $100, or just spread the word about that local station.
[00:50:40.529 --> 00:50:44.091]  But that's another part of the equation supporting those local affiliates.
[00:50:44.811 --> 00:50:52.294]  We'll be right back on the other side with the fake polls, the latest on Obamacare, and so much more.
[00:50:52.414 --> 00:50:55.856]  Eric Trump says President tougher than DC swamp, carrying country on his back.
[00:50:56.256 --> 00:50:57.277]  I totally agree.
[00:50:57.717 --> 00:50:59.958]  A lot of folks want to sit on the fence about Trump, not me.
[00:51:00.418 --> 00:51:02.299]  I'm all in because he's all in.
[00:51:06.809 --> 00:51:11.418]  The news we're about to cover is some of the most powerful, important information I've ever covered.
[00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:31.417]  Elite publications like the Financial Times of London, the New Yorker Magazine, most importantly Atlantic Monthly, have all come out with articles that I'm going to be showing you on screen while our guest is on, saying we need to overthrow President Trump, we need to have new elections and our homeland security, and take all the Republicans that were elected in 2016 and remove them.
[00:51:31.717 --> 00:51:33.077]  They're calling for death, violence.
[00:51:33.737 --> 00:51:34.718]  This is insane.
[00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:37.979]  So I want to ask Colonel Schaefer, former head of the Bin Laden unit, patriot,
[00:51:39.059 --> 00:51:40.340]  With a lot of big connections.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.281]  Helped expose Benghazi, you name it.
[00:51:42.522 --> 00:51:44.603]  Works for the London Center for Foreign Policy Research.
[00:51:44.983 --> 00:51:45.744]  Fox contributor.
[00:51:46.444 --> 00:51:48.986]  Where we are currently and how serious the situation is.
[00:51:49.066 --> 00:51:51.607]  Colonel Schaefer, you're more of an expert on this than even I am.
[00:51:52.128 --> 00:51:58.952]  I know that you've worked in some of the most classified areas there are and really had a lot of things that I'll never see the light of day for this country.
[00:51:59.372 --> 00:52:01.394]  Am I overestimating how serious this is?
[00:52:02.074 --> 00:52:03.616]  No, Ali, thank you for having me on.
[00:52:03.636 --> 00:52:05.717]  And no, you're laying that completely correctly.
[00:52:05.757 --> 00:52:10.962]  You're essentially outlining the situation based on their own verbiage.
[00:52:11.462 --> 00:52:18.469]  And of course, then when they get caught in the open daylight, they then try to say, no, no, no, no, we never said that.
[00:52:18.489 --> 00:52:19.229]  It's all about you.
[00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.432]  Same way the deep state goes about saying the deep state doesn't exist.
[00:52:23.113 --> 00:52:28.878]  And as you pointed out, this is the first time you and I have spoken since, what, I don't know how many months ago.
[00:52:29.498 --> 00:52:30.959]  Sean Hannity and I haven't spoken.
[00:52:31.339 --> 00:52:39.923]  This is all original work by all of us simply observing what we see and factually analyzing and putting it back out.
[00:52:40.444 --> 00:52:43.825]  And my analysis is just a bit different than yours and Sean's.
[00:52:43.885 --> 00:52:52.009]  Mine is coming from the perspective of how I've looked at and studied terror organizations and how they go about radicalizing individuals.
[00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:55.111]  The way that the left is going about trying
[00:52:55.111 --> 00:52:55.311]  Wow.
[00:52:55.391 --> 00:52:55.451]  Wow.
[00:53:25.623 --> 00:53:27.985]  They put out the message to billions of people.
[00:53:28.005 --> 00:53:29.065]  They know people are going to act.
[00:53:29.085 --> 00:53:30.246]  It's like advertising.
[00:53:50.538 --> 00:53:54.280]  If you put advertising out to billions of people saying, come eat our hamburgers, they're going to come.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:54:01.322]  Well, if you put out advertising to billions saying, kill, kill Republicans, kill Trump, kill Alex Jones, kill, kill, kill, it's going to happen.
[00:54:08.165 --> 00:54:14.128]  Oh, John Oliver came out and put out a piece that took him a couple of weeks to put together, lying about InfoWars.
[00:54:15.327 --> 00:54:20.828]  And look, HBO hack, Insiders Fear leaked emails as FBI joins investigation.
[00:54:20.848 --> 00:54:23.169]  I wonder what we'll find out about old HBO.
[00:54:23.529 --> 00:54:25.289]  I wonder what's going to be in that Hollywood hack.
[00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:26.890]  There's always a lot of goodies.
[00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.871]  Rasmussen, Trump approval down to 38.
[00:54:31.331 --> 00:54:38.132]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to break all that down and show how it's a fraud and go over the history of that information.
[00:54:38.413 --> 00:54:40.033]  Dinesh D'Souza is going to be joining us.
[00:54:40.353 --> 00:54:43.974]  He's got a new book out that is very powerful.
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.202]  The big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American left.
[00:54:48.362 --> 00:54:49.503]  Wait till you hear this.
[00:54:49.863 --> 00:54:50.764]  You think you know it all?
[00:54:50.824 --> 00:54:52.164]  Believe me, I even learned some stuff.
[00:54:52.505 --> 00:54:54.066]  James Wesley Rawls is joining us.
[00:54:54.426 --> 00:54:55.667]  Mark Goldman's joining us.
[00:54:55.787 --> 00:54:57.047]  Roger Stone is joining us.
[00:54:57.568 --> 00:54:59.169]  It's all coming up today.
[00:54:59.209 --> 00:55:05.953]  But first, I saw this number yesterday and it even shocked me from Interpol.
[00:55:07.534 --> 00:55:08.074]  Previously, 80%
[00:55:10.541 --> 00:55:14.765]  Of the quote, refugees coming into Europe, now it's 10 million according to the UN.
[00:55:15.466 --> 00:55:20.150]  They run the EU migrant program and they flood your country for military age men.
[00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:27.797]  And I knew that less than 1% were Christian, even though 20% roughly of Syria was Christian until the ethnic cleansing of the globalists.
[00:55:28.257 --> 00:55:34.382]  Well now it's being reported that just over 1% of migrants arriving in Italy are Syrian refugees.
[00:55:35.387 --> 00:55:37.329]  This according to the Italian government.
[00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:40.111]  That article's up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:41.372 --> 00:55:42.232]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:55:42.273 --> 00:55:45.615]  Just 1% of migrants arriving in Italy are Syrian refugees.
[00:55:46.036 --> 00:55:51.460]  And most of the so-called Syrians that were there are folks that invaded Syria as part of the Arab Spring.
[00:55:53.241 --> 00:55:56.404]  Syria's not really Arab, but it's always getting invaded by the Arabs.
[00:55:56.884 --> 00:55:58.205]  That's how you get things in the Middle East.
[00:55:58.245 --> 00:55:58.986]  You go steal them.
[00:56:00.287 --> 00:56:10.190]  New figures show that just 1.4% of migrants arriving in Italy are Syrian refugees, confirming the fact that the overwhelming majority of people flooding into Europe are economic migrants from countries not at war.
[00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:15.072]  But they just say, oh, they're war-torn Christians when they're not.
[00:56:15.752 --> 00:56:21.294]  Or they always say, oh, it's boys, it's children, it's boys that raped and killed a woman.
[00:56:21.814 --> 00:56:24.955]  Kind of like, oh, we're letting children in from Mexico.
[00:56:25.535 --> 00:56:27.836]  And most of them aren't from Mexico, and most of them aren't children.
[00:56:29.009 --> 00:56:30.530]  Something like 17% were under the age of 18.
[00:56:31.591 --> 00:56:33.633]  But the children are here!
[00:56:34.113 --> 00:56:40.618]  Yes, one guy got deported 20 times, and he just got indicted again for more criminal activity.
[00:56:41.999 --> 00:56:56.651]  The numbers obtained by the Westminster via Eurostat, the official body tasked with providing statistical information to the Institution of the European Union, underscores how the true nature of the migrant crisis is being completely misrepresented by the press, left-wing groups, and politicians.
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:10.506]  And it goes on to say that out of 58,000 they sampled, just 845 were supposedly Syrians, and most of them weren't even Syrians either, if you look at those numbers.
[00:57:13.687 --> 00:57:19.030]  Meanwhile, there's a story by Kit Daniels breaking more of this down.
[00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:21.031]  Report.
[00:57:21.051 --> 00:57:23.332]  71% of Italians oppose migrant invasion.
[00:57:24.497 --> 00:57:25.958]  That's a Dan Lyman report.
[00:57:26.219 --> 00:57:27.139]  Kid, I guess, handed it to me.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.442]  Panic building as migrants flood Italy in tidal waves.
[00:57:31.023 --> 00:57:47.057]  And the answer, of course, is a new EU Navy to make sure that the Italian Navy doesn't stop them or turn them back from the Soros Zodiac boats that go out and pick them up on the coast of Libya and then bring them back in to rape, kill and destroy.
[00:57:47.958 --> 00:57:57.541]  Then they tell Europeans, you've got to get rid of your free speech to comply with Sharia, and they air TV ads from Italy to Germany showing women in hijabs saying, do you wear the hijab?
[00:57:57.581 --> 00:57:58.562]  Do you join Islam?
[00:57:58.862 --> 00:57:59.642]  Islam is good!
[00:57:59.662 --> 00:58:00.882]  Join Islam today!
[00:58:01.443 --> 00:58:02.863]  Official UN reports.
[00:58:04.243 --> 00:58:05.424]  And now, the
[00:58:06.812 --> 00:58:20.359]  Scottish government is defending TV pieces they funded, and art pieces they funded, with black people dancing around saying, the Scots are scum, and will be defeated, they will be bred out, you are inbred, you are scum, you will die.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:26.943]  There's a new article, and the government says, yes, and it's black guys dancing around going, you are white, you are scum, you will die.
[00:58:28.942 --> 00:58:30.663]  I mean, and you're just like, what is going on here?
[00:58:31.224 --> 00:58:33.325]  Well, the globalists have already exploited the third world.
[00:58:33.585 --> 00:58:34.686]  They can look at the demographics.
[00:58:35.106 --> 00:58:37.468]  They're going to turn, the minorities are bringing in racists.
[00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:39.690]  They're going to totally balkanize society with it.
[00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:45.854]  This is a military wrecking ball operation run by Soros, the Democratic Party, and the globalists.
[00:58:46.514 --> 00:58:47.735]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:58:48.756 --> 00:58:49.837]  Second hour coming up.

[01:00:00.407 --> 01:00:01.712]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:31.090]  We now take you live.
[01:00:33.391 --> 01:00:39.433]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:42.394]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.454 --> 01:00:47.256]  So YouTube's announcing censorship of anything conservative, libertarian, or patriotic, or common sense.
[01:00:48.036 --> 01:00:50.697]  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, they're all doing it.
[01:00:50.957 --> 01:00:56.419]  And they're hiring these lynch mobs that are given the power to go out and declare things evil or racist so they can then be banned.
[01:00:57.128 --> 01:00:58.529]  You know, like the word mother or father.
[01:00:58.609 --> 01:01:04.673]  Now a professor who refuses to stop saying men and women exist has been banned from YouTube.
[01:01:05.013 --> 01:01:07.034]  That's coming up in the next segment with Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:01:07.274 --> 01:01:09.315]  But first, here's a report on Twitter lynch mobs.
[01:01:10.296 --> 01:01:12.397]  Twitter allows you to spread information instantly.
[01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:15.579]  Tweets can go viral within minutes and narratives formed even faster.
[01:01:15.859 --> 01:01:19.221]  Upon a cursory consideration, one might believe this is a positive thing.
[01:01:19.602 --> 01:01:24.645]  However, it's often the case that narratives can spread first, while the facts trail far, far behind.
[01:01:25.325 --> 01:01:32.774]  If a tweet appears to confirm our fondest hopes or darkest fears, it's only natural that we'd instantly hit that retweet button with little consideration for its veracity.
[01:01:33.215 --> 01:01:38.681]  The ability to breed in-group solidarity with one click leads to an abandonment of basic evidentiary standards.
[01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:40.684]  That's human nature, and it's understandable.
[01:01:41.044 --> 01:01:45.448]  This tweet-first-think-later approach predictably leads to kangaroo courts of public opinion.
[01:01:45.708 --> 01:01:46.969]  Essentially, mob rule.
[01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:55.396]  This phenomenon manifested itself on Twitter when 35,000 individuals retweeted a photo of a man that was accused of randomly pulling the headpiece off a Muslim.
[01:01:55.717 --> 01:01:59.360]  The tweets read, This man at Baker Street forcefully attempted to pull my hijab off.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:02.162]  When I instinctively grabbed a hold of my scarf, he hit me.
[01:02:02.482 --> 01:02:06.506]  He proceeded to verbally abuse my friends and I, pinning one of them against the wall and spinning in her face.
[01:02:06.906 --> 01:02:10.889]  Over 2,000 users angrily condemned the man and claimed that they would like to violently attack him.
[01:02:11.209 --> 01:02:17.933]  Many more called for his name, phone number, and work and home address as to be published to presumably harass him for this most contemptible act.
[01:02:18.614 --> 01:02:28.160]  One problem, though initially there were many calls to violence and harassment, there were not very many tweets to the tune of perhaps we should wait till the police investigate after all we've only heard one side of the story.
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.482]  Confirmation bias had swept thousands away like
[01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:37.364]  Hundreds of thousands of cursory observers saw hundreds of tweets and articles pour in that made them feel morally righteous and tingly inside.
[01:02:37.404 --> 01:02:41.105]  In their mind, it was an indisputable fact that this man was an unadulterated racist Islamophobe or something.
[01:02:56.750 --> 01:03:01.776]  So naturally, it became their moral obligation to insert a valuable half-second into retweeting this.
[01:03:02.236 --> 01:03:11.046]  But taking a few minutes to assess the preponderance of evidence would be, I think, a much more reasonable approach to this accusation than, someone should have pushed him onto the tracks.
[01:03:11.647 --> 01:03:16.650]  See, a cursory investigation of the available information revealed that there was indeed another side to the story.
[01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:20.052]  The man accused of attacking and tearing away this woman's hijab made this statement.
[01:03:20.392 --> 01:03:28.197]  Quote, in regard to recent evidence, I was accused of completely false allegation because I defended my partner by trying to completely defuse a racist attack from three other random females.
[01:03:28.477 --> 01:03:35.361]  As a result, one of the females in particular responded by making malicious, completely false allegations against me, and I would like to confirm I never hit or attacked anyone.
[01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:37.943]  I simply defused a situation by separating them.
[01:03:38.343 --> 01:03:47.072]  The police is fully cooperating with me and will be able to obtain CCTV footage showing three women attempting to attack my partner because we are in an interracial relationship."
[01:03:48.153 --> 01:03:52.517]  So, two completely conflicting stories, one of which sounding patently more reasonable than the other.
[01:03:52.738 --> 01:03:59.004]  Not to mention that this woman did not appear willing to stand by her tweet as it has now been deleted, banishing it into the twitlight zone.
[01:03:59.344 --> 01:04:02.567]  Regardless, it would appear we'd need to see evidence before jumping to conclusions.
[01:04:02.747 --> 01:04:05.169]  Alright, the full video is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:06.210]  It's far worse than this.
[01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:10.714]  They encourage on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter the left going out and doing this on purpose.
[01:04:10.754 --> 01:04:12.095]  It's like J.K.
[01:04:12.155 --> 01:04:21.924]  Rowling's saying that Trump wouldn't shake the little kid in the wheelchair's hand when he goes over first to him, hugs him, pats on him, talks to him more than all the other people basically combined.
[01:04:22.224 --> 01:04:26.548]  Then later he's walking out, little kid reaches for him, Trump doesn't see it, so that's his fault.
[01:04:27.048 --> 01:04:34.394]  Just like when the Polish president and his wife walk out, Trump's wife reaches out first, so the Polish president shakes her hand first, then Trump's.
[01:04:34.654 --> 01:04:38.838]  Kind of like somebody walks up, you both stick your hands out, you shake the woman's first, then you shake the other one.
[01:04:39.218 --> 01:04:39.858]  Isn't a diss.
[01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:49.086]  But it's all about shunning, and it's all about keeping people in arrested development, junior high mentality, like we're in the third grade, and who is the cool kid?
[01:04:50.279 --> 01:05:01.182]  After all, that's what modern leftism is, is creating arrested development, isolated, alone individuals who can be controlled by AI systems, according to Facebook's own documents, leaked to The Australian three months ago.
[01:05:04.283 --> 01:05:09.104]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:27.408]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:05:28.189 --> 01:05:36.059]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:05:36.359 --> 01:05:45.610]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[01:05:46.391 --> 01:05:52.598]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[01:05:53.019 --> 01:06:06.774]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:06:07.515 --> 01:06:17.901]  Bottom line, when you purchase Caveman at m4warstore.com, you're supporting the broadcast and true independent media that's fighting for the future of this country to be a free nation.
[01:06:18.261 --> 01:06:19.081]  So it's a win-win.
[01:06:19.361 --> 01:06:25.225]  But you really should try it for yourself to see what it's done for myself and so many others.
[01:06:26.005 --> 01:06:28.286]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[01:06:28.406 --> 01:06:29.666]  We're getting results.
[01:06:30.106 --> 01:06:36.967]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:06:37.328 --> 01:06:39.168]  Because of you praying for the broadcast.
[01:06:39.188 --> 01:06:43.049]  Because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:48.170]  And because you spread the articles and the videos and the links and tell folks about our local affiliates.
[01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:50.531]  Caveman is back in stock.
[01:06:50.911 --> 01:06:52.211]  People absolutely love it.
[01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:58.334]  So please, secure your Caveman today at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:07:04.224 --> 01:07:06.647]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:07:07.267 --> 01:07:10.991]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:07:11.492 --> 01:07:18.219]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:07:18.839 --> 01:07:21.982]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:07:22.703 --> 01:07:42.332]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:07:42.852 --> 01:07:46.434]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:07:46.994 --> 01:07:57.462]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:03.406]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:19.762]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:08:20.282 --> 01:08:22.943]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:38.761 --> 01:08:46.706]  Well, the Attorney General has announced plans to actually look at attacks on white people, racial attacks on white folks.
[01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:52.429]  The Justice Department has also announced they're going to look at whites being kicked out of higher education.
[01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:58.993]  And the leftist media, MSNBC, you name it, is calling this racist.
[01:08:59.993 --> 01:09:06.097]  Because they now teach, as you see every day, in Europe and the United States, that being white is inherently evil.
[01:09:07.227 --> 01:09:10.569]  And that whites are these mutants, and that we have to be gotten rid of.
[01:09:10.629 --> 01:09:14.931]  I mean, I've got three articles in mainstream news with the Scottish government funding it, the U.S.
[01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:15.632]  government funding it.
[01:09:15.672 --> 01:09:23.236]  We see colleges in Oregon having weekends where the whites aren't allowed, and liberal professors even say, well, that's racist.
[01:09:23.796 --> 01:09:25.917]  And then they get driven off campus.
[01:09:28.458 --> 01:09:29.619]  This is by design.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:36.443]  The difference is we've contained it on the universities and in the federal government, so they're eating their own now.
[01:09:37.526 --> 01:09:48.234]  And that's what's happening is because the most radical elements are then dominating the debate in the leftist echo chambers and creating fascism.
[01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:51.016]  And I've said that many times and that's what Dinesh D'Souza breaks down.
[01:09:51.036 --> 01:09:53.598]  It's not that he's plagiarizing me or I'm plagiarizing him.
[01:09:53.938 --> 01:09:55.620]  We're looking at the same thing.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.962]  It's like we're both at the Grand Canyon, the same spot.
[01:09:58.982 --> 01:09:59.382]  What do you see?
[01:09:59.402 --> 01:10:00.663]  I see the biggest canyon in the world.
[01:10:00.703 --> 01:10:01.104]  It's beautiful.
[01:10:02.217 --> 01:10:04.718]  Yeah, look at that Blue Jay sitting in the tree.
[01:10:05.018 --> 01:10:24.384]  Well, we're looking at this, and we're seeing frothing people hitting women in the head with bike locks, macing men, women, and children, beating people where they're putting comas, and it's in the WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton sent them out there, and the media turns around and says that libertarians or conservatives did it.
[01:10:25.427 --> 01:10:40.933]  And so the very same Democratic Party that was the party of race baiting and of the KKK has flipped it now, looked at demographics, and is trying to turn minorities that are the new majority, about to be the supermajority, into
[01:10:42.259 --> 01:10:48.801]  Race-based operatives as well, instead of it being based on a culture of free market, prosperity, and free association.
[01:10:49.021 --> 01:10:49.841]  The book's excellent.
[01:10:50.201 --> 01:10:52.822]  In fact, I want to carry it to Infowarsstore.com, but we're not yet.
[01:10:53.162 --> 01:10:56.503]  The Big Lie Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left.
[01:10:57.043 --> 01:11:06.065]  Dinesh D'Souza, who also was a political prisoner, got five of his friends to give money to a Senate candidate that was his friend from college, didn't sign the right paperwork.
[01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:13.558]  Meanwhile, Hillary gets $30 million for Russian uranium transfers of U.S.
[01:11:13.638 --> 01:11:14.159]  uranium.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.803]  $12 million in Morocco to sell out our interest.
[01:11:17.804 --> 01:11:18.885]  It's simply incredible.
[01:11:18.905 --> 01:11:21.469]  And now they're calling for me to be criminally arrested in Newsweek.
[01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:27.817]  And they've got congressional hearings saying I'm a Russian spy with no proof, and that I'm under criminal investigation.
[01:11:27.877 --> 01:11:29.700]  So this is quite a club to be in here.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.802]  These people are dangerous, folks.
[01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:33.685]  And they're lying to a new level.
[01:11:33.725 --> 01:11:36.870]  So it's not just political violence, they're now lying violently.
[01:11:38.075 --> 01:11:41.417]  Newsweek last week said that I'm calling for, quote, killing more liberals.
[01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.118]  They don't show where I said it.
[01:11:43.158 --> 01:11:44.379]  They don't show a link.
[01:11:44.799 --> 01:11:45.880]  They just lie.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:50.943]  So they've gone into an insane mode, and they're very dangerous.
[01:11:51.743 --> 01:11:54.465]  They're putting out fake polls of the president, just like they did with Hillary.
[01:11:54.885 --> 01:11:57.167]  The big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American left.
[01:11:57.527 --> 01:12:04.751]  Dinesh D'Souza, documentary filmmaker, former cabinet official, department head in the Reagan administration.
[01:12:05.712 --> 01:12:07.653]  Joining us to talk about the big lie.
[01:12:07.673 --> 01:12:10.014]  I mean, you've heard me kind of set up the interview.
[01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:11.875]  There's so many examples.
[01:12:11.955 --> 01:12:13.376]  It's so wild-eyed now.
[01:12:13.436 --> 01:12:15.297]  It's so crazy now.
[01:12:15.317 --> 01:12:23.221]  I mean, you rightfully say that we're going from the left being racist to fascist.
[01:12:24.922 --> 01:12:26.023]  What's really happening here?
[01:12:27.162 --> 01:12:37.363]  Well, I think what's remarkable is that the new fascism of our time marches behind the banner of anti-fascism.
[01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:53.482]  So that when you look at the people who are wearing masks, carrying weapons, blocking people from speaking, relying on a kind of intimidation and terrorism to cow everybody into silence.
[01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:59.986]  These are the modern day equivalents of Mussolini's black shirts and Hitler's brown shirts.
[01:13:00.586 --> 01:13:04.008]  The difference is that the black shirts and the brown shirts happily wore the label.
[01:13:04.588 --> 01:13:10.770]  Whereas these new guys call themselves Antifa, they pretend to be fighting fascism.
[01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:14.512]  So the fascist theme is back in American politics.
[01:13:14.592 --> 01:13:19.613]  They're trying to pin the fascist label on Trump, on the Republicans.
[01:13:20.234 --> 01:13:26.136]  They have for a long time been cultivating the idea that fascism is a phenomenon of the right.
[01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:27.496]  We've all been taught that.
[01:13:28.016 --> 01:13:31.798]  That on the left you might have communism, but on the right you have fascism.
[01:13:32.478 --> 01:13:44.253]  And this lie is given some plausibility by the fact that Hitler and Stalin fought against each other in World War II, so it appears like they must be ideological opposites.
[01:13:44.914 --> 01:13:48.699]  But remember that Hitler and Stalin were allied at the beginning.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.561]  Until Hitler turned on Stalin.
[01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:55.544]  In reality, fascism and communism are not that far apart.
[01:13:55.984 --> 01:14:01.749]  Their battle is better understood like the battle between the Shia and the Sunni.
[01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:07.513]  Very bitter battle to be sure, but both operating from within the house of Islam.
[01:14:07.853 --> 01:14:15.019]  And so similarly, fascism and communism are two species of collectivism, vying for power.
[01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:21.001]  And the whole idea that fascism and Nazism are on the right, that's a big, big lie.
[01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:36.465]  I personally go out on the street now and I have leftists come over and tell me they want to physically attack me and just hiss and yell and say Russian spy or Nazi, just all these comical things.
[01:14:36.525 --> 01:14:40.886]  Don't they realize they're in black running around trying to bar people from speaking
[01:14:41.266 --> 01:14:43.047]  They're running around trying to intimidate people.
[01:14:43.067 --> 01:14:44.908]  They're telling us what language to use.
[01:14:45.288 --> 01:14:47.389]  They're telling us hyper-political correctness.
[01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:54.093]  They're teaching classical racism now in mainstream news with MTV shows about the problem of being white.
[01:14:54.253 --> 01:14:55.853]  I mean, it's just insanity.
[01:14:56.274 --> 01:15:04.338]  And I'm not giving the quote minorities a pass here, but it's mainly led by university professors and people that are white.
[01:15:05.158 --> 01:15:11.408]  But they're creating their new cadres to lead the minorities, who are the majority when you put them together, into this system.
[01:15:11.428 --> 01:15:18.759]  And they're saying Trump won because of inherent racism when it was the left that ran the campaign on a race-based system.
[01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:32.663]  Yes, not only is the left tactically fascist, not only are they using the sort of tactics of the Nazis, but they also have the ideology of the Nazis.
[01:15:33.104 --> 01:15:39.146]  Let's remember that Nazism and fascism were both variants of socialism.
[01:15:39.286 --> 01:15:40.947]  Hitler's party was called
[01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:43.290]  The National Socialist Party.
[01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:48.776]  The very word Nazi is putting together National and Socialista.
[01:15:48.816 --> 01:15:50.499]  That's where we get the sound Nazi.
[01:15:51.334 --> 01:15:53.075]  Mussolini was a Marxist.
[01:15:53.255 --> 01:15:56.317]  He was the leader of the Italian Socialist Party.
[01:15:56.797 --> 01:15:58.799]  He was recognized to be on the left.
[01:15:58.899 --> 01:16:00.560]  He saw himself as on the left.
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:06.563]  When Mussolini came to power, Lenin sent him a telegram of congratulations.
[01:16:06.983 --> 01:16:07.324]  Why?
[01:16:07.744 --> 01:16:12.627]  Because Lenin recognized that Mussolini was a fellow revolutionary of the left.
[01:16:13.107 --> 01:16:27.234]  So, what an incredible sleight of hand in which these leftists, whose political platform reads like it's right out of the Democratic Party platform... And by the way, Dinesh, this is something... You're absolutely right.
[01:16:27.254 --> 01:16:35.038]  This is something that leftists on universities say that we're lying about, and a real hot point from them, because it's a fact the Nazis were National Socialists.
[01:16:35.438 --> 01:16:39.099]  It's a fact that he modeled himself after the fascistas in Italy.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.740]  It's a fact they wore black.
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.121]  It's a fact they wore masks.
[01:16:42.381 --> 01:16:42.481]  It's
[01:16:57.318 --> 01:16:57.398]  For
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:22.302]  That backed Hitler early on because he was a vegetarian and a bunch of other issues and he wanted planning of society.
[01:17:22.342 --> 01:17:27.004]  This is incontrovertible that the KKK was founded by the Democratic Party.
[01:17:27.344 --> 01:17:34.926]  It is incontrovertible that the Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act and took, you know, that system away from them and they panic.
[01:17:35.287 --> 01:17:42.309]  It is incontrovertible that the power structure got scared of American Christians and American Republicans and Eisenhower
[01:17:43.209 --> 01:17:49.254]  And created this whole new strategy to get everybody to go, oh, you're going to be liberal?
[01:17:49.294 --> 01:17:50.435]  You're going to be anti-racist?
[01:17:50.835 --> 01:18:02.924]  We'll take it over and make it extreme, own it, then double-cross you later and make everything race-based again, once whites have been taught to bow down as long as you say something's for racial equality.
[01:18:03.164 --> 01:18:11.691]  So they're using our goodness, our bigness, our Christian Western ethos that unifies, who deny the West is the most open, to then bring us down.
[01:18:13.601 --> 01:18:17.944]  Yes, I'll add to your list of incontrovertibles.
[01:18:18.124 --> 01:18:34.474]  It is incontrovertible, and I document this in the book, that Hitler got the specific blueprint for the Nuremberg Laws, the laws that discriminated against Jews, segregated them into ghettos, later confiscated their property, state-sponsored discrimination.
[01:18:34.934 --> 01:18:39.297]  These laws are not just, you may say, they're not just similar.
[01:18:39.697 --> 01:18:42.099]  To the Jim Crow laws of the Democratic South.
[01:18:42.319 --> 01:18:46.983]  The Nazis actually used the blueprint of the Democratic laws.
[01:18:47.063 --> 01:18:48.404]  And Margaret Sanger.
[01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.005]  It's incredible.
[01:18:50.045 --> 01:18:51.506]  It's incredible.
[01:18:52.287 --> 01:18:52.767]  It's incredible.
[01:18:52.787 --> 01:18:53.788]  Your book documents it all.
[01:18:53.828 --> 01:18:58.051]  And Margaret Sanger, Hitler kept a book of hers signed by his bed.
[01:18:58.351 --> 01:18:59.993]  They wrote love letters to each other.
[01:19:00.213 --> 01:19:02.174]  The Rockefeller Foundation funded it all.
[01:19:02.394 --> 01:19:04.396]  The Rockefeller Foundation created the UN.
[01:19:04.676 --> 01:19:07.637]  The Rockefeller Foundation literally runs all this.
[01:19:07.697 --> 01:19:12.699]  So with your book, your research, your international skills, what is their master plan now?
[01:19:12.919 --> 01:19:24.824]  Because it's incontrovertible, a planned fascist society with no free speech, getting everybody to fight with each other over racial identity, sexual identity, putting us all in our ghettos, controlled by a super state.
[01:19:24.864 --> 01:19:25.504]  Is that not the plan?
[01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:34.773]  Well, you know, we're obviously going to be under the accusation of exaggerating, of being paranoid.
[01:19:35.054 --> 01:19:37.155]  Dinesh, how can you use this term fascist?
[01:19:37.575 --> 01:19:39.056]  Now, here's my point.
[01:19:39.096 --> 01:19:42.439]  If we actually look at the policies of Obama,
[01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:49.343]  The policies supported now by Elizabeth Warren and by Bernie, I want to raise a question.
[01:19:49.403 --> 01:19:56.487]  Are these economic policies more accurately called socialist in the Marxist sense or fascist?
[01:19:56.828 --> 01:20:03.812]  Remember that the core meaning of fascism in economic terms is state-run capitalism.
[01:20:04.713 --> 01:20:10.579]  And if you look at what the progressives are all about, they're not really pursuing socialism per se.
[01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.763]  The socialists in every country want to nationalize industry.
[01:20:14.063 --> 01:20:19.530]  They want the government to actually nationalize and own the energy sector.
[01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:21.491]  The banks and so on.
[01:20:21.851 --> 01:20:24.033]  Obviously, we still have private hospitals.
[01:20:24.093 --> 01:20:25.694]  We have private insurance companies.
[01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:28.055]  But the government is telling them what to do.
[01:20:28.075 --> 01:20:29.697]  The government is setting prices.
[01:20:30.117 --> 01:20:34.760]  Under Obama, we've seen government regulation expand dramatically.
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:35.801]  It's a cult of power.
[01:20:36.001 --> 01:20:37.722]  They use social engineering against us.
[01:20:37.982 --> 01:20:40.564]  They use race to control us because they know how powerful it is.
[01:20:41.004 --> 01:20:45.427]  What do we do then when they're double-crossing the Christian ethos of bringing people together?
[01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:47.588]  They've used our strength against us.
[01:20:47.989 --> 01:20:48.409]  What do we do?
[01:20:49.363 --> 01:21:00.346]  So basically we need, and my last chapter is called denazification, and what that means is we've got to realize that we're actually facing a very bad bunch of guys who are willing to stop at nothing.
[01:21:01.026 --> 01:21:04.247]  We need knowledge and then we need courageous action.
[01:21:04.547 --> 01:21:05.847]  So the knowledge is in the book.
[01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:15.110]  It's going to equip you, it's going to help you to fire back and move fascism out of the right-wing column back into the left-wing column where it belongs.
[01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:17.511]  But knowledge is not enough.
[01:21:17.991 --> 01:21:24.132]  We've got to realize that we're dealing with people who are willing to break the law, who are willing to cause physical harm and destruction.
[01:21:24.452 --> 01:21:26.613]  We have to hold these people accountable.
[01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:36.115]  During the Civil War, when Abraham Lincoln found out that the Confederates were executing free blacks, he issued an order that he acknowledged was barbaric.
[01:21:36.455 --> 01:21:42.816]  He said, for every free black executed by the Confederacy, I am going to shoot one Confederate soldier.
[01:21:43.137 --> 01:21:44.897]  Now, he understood that this was very tough.
[01:21:45.297 --> 01:21:48.820]  But he realized, how else are we going to get these people to stop?
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:57.427]  I think we need to realize that we need to impose the law in a very tough way on these new fascists who are posing as anti-fascists.
[01:21:57.767 --> 01:21:59.368]  That's the only way to stop them.
[01:21:59.649 --> 01:22:03.151]  We need a new kind of Republican to actually carry this out.
[01:22:03.532 --> 01:22:06.534]  What do we do about the minorities that they have whipped?
[01:22:06.694 --> 01:22:08.536]  Even though that's not really the most
[01:22:09.528 --> 01:22:17.173]  Out of control group I've seen, but we see the racial attacks on whites, on others, on Asians, being killed, being beaten to death, the knockout game.
[01:22:17.193 --> 01:22:19.975]  It's in the news every day, but the media whitewashes it.
[01:22:20.055 --> 01:22:27.740]  Islamists is being brought into Europe, into here, the rape gangs, the cover-ups, the left banning people that criticize radical Islam.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:38.807]  I mean, they're really coming in with massive censorship right now, calling us the racists, saying censor us, and a lot of folks have fallen for the trap, going, we're not racists, don't censor us, instead of, hey,
[01:22:39.307 --> 01:22:47.156]  Allow free speech on YouTube, on Google, on Facebook, and on Twitter, because once you start censoring one group, you'll censor everybody.
[01:22:47.176 --> 01:22:52.282]  I think we're losing the debate here because we argue we're not racist, which is true, but they don't care.
[01:22:52.602 --> 01:22:56.987]  Once they set the precedent to ban racists, they have the precedent to ban their opposition.
[01:22:58.786 --> 01:23:05.189]  Yeah, the Democrats have always been the party of racial consciousness, of racial discrimination.
[01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:10.932]  And you might say that, in a sense, they're doing the same thing now, only in the opposite direction.
[01:23:10.972 --> 01:23:13.554]  They've created this kind of multicultural tent.
[01:23:14.294 --> 01:23:18.756]  They supposedly ask every group to affirm its racial identity.
[01:23:19.056 --> 01:23:21.577]  Hey blacks, you need to be proud of being black.
[01:23:21.857 --> 01:23:22.837]  Black is beautiful.
[01:23:23.097 --> 01:23:25.798]  Hey Asians, you've got to be proud of being Asian and so on.
[01:23:26.078 --> 01:23:26.839]  Except whites.
[01:23:27.179 --> 01:23:33.321]  So there's a kind of exemption for whites and everybody is encouraged to gang up, you might say, on the whites.
[01:23:34.121 --> 01:23:37.043]  Naturally, this has created a volatile situation.
[01:23:37.464 --> 01:23:51.913]  This, I think, helps to explain why some sort of white nationalists go, Trump is our only hope, because they would normally be in the Democratic Party, but the Democratic Party has constructed itself in such a way that there's room for every kind of
[01:23:53.154 --> 01:23:55.716]  And I agree.
[01:23:55.836 --> 01:23:59.600]  And again, it's so cartoonish and it's standard procedure.
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:01.982]  It's not like the radicals or the Democrats are doing this.
[01:24:02.302 --> 01:24:03.283]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:24:03.323 --> 01:24:09.248]  They say, we're losing and we're going to lose to this Republican idea, libertarian idea of economic empowerment.
[01:24:09.528 --> 01:24:27.609]  We've got to go to culture war and they talk about using race baiting and it's so cartoonish the stuff they're doing all over the news saying whites are inherently evil and having college courses about we must exterminate and get rid of whites and feminist magazines saying if you're white and have a white baby abort it.
[01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:29.572]  I mean this is cuckoo level.
[01:24:31.048 --> 01:24:31.848]  It completely is.
[01:24:31.908 --> 01:24:43.670]  And here we, I think we, I have to give Trump a little bit of credit because in my lifetime, he's the only president that I've seen who understands that he needs to fight not just a political war, but a culture war.
[01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:52.212]  And, you know, Reagan, whom I adore, I was a young Reaganite in the 80s, but Reagan's view was you can't change the world in 10 ways or 20 ways.
[01:24:52.252 --> 01:24:54.392]  You can change the world in maybe one or two ways.
[01:24:54.792 --> 01:24:56.932]  So Reagan focused on the Soviet Union.
[01:24:56.972 --> 01:24:59.873]  He focused on taxation and that's about it.
[01:25:00.373 --> 01:25:13.724]  But with Trump, here's a guy who's pulling us out of the trade pact and fighting to change Obamacare and he's put Gorsuch on the Supreme Court and at the same time he's swatting Meryl Streep and whopping Saturday Night Live and he's taken on CNN.
[01:25:14.104 --> 01:25:19.529]  This guy, for a guy in his 70s, is energetic on all fronts and I gotta say I like that.
[01:25:20.663 --> 01:25:22.386]  Well, you say you gotta give him a little credit.
[01:25:22.446 --> 01:25:23.688]  I totally agree with you.
[01:25:24.228 --> 01:25:29.376]  Eric Trump has pointed out that he's tougher than the swamp creatures and is carrying the country on his back.
[01:25:29.917 --> 01:25:34.403]  How can you not marvel somebody that defeated the fake polls, defeated the rigged debates?
[01:25:35.612 --> 01:25:55.036]  Came from behind one big time and has now killed TPP, killed the carbon tax that was meant to literally de-industrialize us, gotten the stock market up $3 trillion despite the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, 69% reduction in illegals coming across the border according to Homeland Security now in just six months.
[01:25:55.116 --> 01:26:00.517]  I mean, it goes on and on and on, breaking the back of political correctness, getting a good Supreme Court justice in.
[01:26:00.597 --> 01:26:02.177]  Of course the deep state hates him.
[01:26:02.717 --> 01:26:06.679]  Because they'd conquered this country and now it's come back from the dead.
[01:26:06.699 --> 01:26:14.482]  It's unbelievable to see how so many in the Republican Party, they just don't get Trump.
[01:26:14.662 --> 01:26:17.263]  Or at least Trump, they're scared of Trump.
[01:26:18.736 --> 01:26:23.197]  Part of it is that they worry Trump is going to blow up and blow them up with him.
[01:26:23.918 --> 01:26:30.319]  Part of it is that Trump acts in a way that is outside convention and this completely immobilizes them.
[01:26:30.539 --> 01:26:33.140]  And some of them are actively opposed to Trump.
[01:26:34.401 --> 01:26:38.021]  Sometimes I feel in the intellectual sphere, I'm almost all by myself.
[01:26:38.122 --> 01:26:43.323]  The conservative intelligentsia has turned away from Trump, if not against Trump.
[01:26:43.823 --> 01:26:47.126]  This, I think, is intellectual suicide on the part of our side.
[01:26:47.467 --> 01:26:51.370]  This is a time where if we come together, victory is totally in our grasp.
[01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:56.115]  We can push back this fascist strain in American culture.
[01:26:56.415 --> 01:27:02.561]  We have three branches of government to do it, and the left is pulling out all the stops.
[01:27:03.649 --> 01:27:06.271]  Well, a lot of these Republican establishment have been rhinos.
[01:27:06.311 --> 01:27:07.972]  Republican name only, as you know.
[01:27:08.672 --> 01:27:10.233]  And they have been there the whole time.
[01:27:10.293 --> 01:27:11.774]  They know they're in desperate straits.
[01:27:12.134 --> 01:27:13.395]  They want to be the ruling class.
[01:27:13.415 --> 01:27:17.078]  They don't want to send power back to the states and back to the people.
[01:27:17.118 --> 01:27:19.879]  So Jeff Flake comes out and says, I'm a globalist.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:21.601]  I don't like Trump.
[01:27:22.794 --> 01:27:31.998]  And Democratic operatives on national TV like Stephanopoulos celebrate the Republicans in the Senate turning their back on Trump like this is some defeat of Trump.
[01:27:32.758 --> 01:27:33.658]  They're the problem.
[01:27:35.059 --> 01:27:38.300]  They're the ones that helped write Obamacare to begin with.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.061]  It's Trump getting rid of the scam.
[01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:43.162]  His failure to repeal it is their failure.
[01:27:43.742 --> 01:27:45.983]  And it just makes him more of a champion.
[01:27:46.263 --> 01:27:48.504]  We must target them in the upcoming midterms.
[01:27:48.864 --> 01:27:49.925]  We must punish them.
[01:27:50.325 --> 01:27:52.546]  Not look at Trumpism as a failure.
[01:27:52.606 --> 01:27:55.507]  As you said, victory is in our grasp.
[01:27:55.847 --> 01:28:00.509]  A global realignment is happening for nationalism, free market, and common sense.
[01:28:00.969 --> 01:28:02.089]  The tide is going out.
[01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:03.450]  The elites even admit that.
[01:28:03.730 --> 01:28:12.993]  And so they want to run this mind game on us, like National Review just wrote this big story saying death of a salesman that Trump's a total failure, always been a failure.
[01:28:13.693 --> 01:28:18.478]  The guy's the biggest, you know, dark horse winner in modern American politics.
[01:28:18.518 --> 01:28:20.680]  The guy is nothing but a success story.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.541]  A titan of resistance.
[01:28:22.622 --> 01:28:24.984]  A titan of going up against peer pressure.
[01:28:25.244 --> 01:28:27.146]  A titan of breaking the elites back.
[01:28:28.373 --> 01:28:37.139]  You know, for a whole generation since Reagan, we've had these absolutely intellectually shallow, incoherent Republican leaders.
[01:28:37.539 --> 01:28:45.525]  And the whole conservative intelligence here obediently lined up behind them, saluted what they did, even when it was abominably stupid.
[01:28:45.885 --> 01:28:48.887]  And now when Trump comes along, they go, he's not a conservative.
[01:28:49.267 --> 01:28:54.954]  He's acting in a more conservative way than George W. Bush, George H.W.
[01:28:54.994 --> 01:28:55.234]  Bush.
[01:28:55.274 --> 01:28:59.079]  He's certainly more conservative than McCain, let alone Bob Dole.
[01:28:59.439 --> 01:29:03.344]  So this is the most conservative president we've seen in a generation.
[01:29:04.705 --> 01:29:13.709]  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Bill Crystals of the world and all these dudes are acting as if Trump is some kind of a liberal in disguise.
[01:29:13.729 --> 01:29:25.215]  Because they're weak-minded and they care about mainstream media and the cocktail parties because they're old, they're part of the old system, they don't understand their time has come and gone and obviously, Dash, you
[01:29:25.635 --> 01:29:40.020]  You know, come from common folks, been successful on your own action, just like myself and many others, and we're together for a free market, for a future, for a system that is anti-racist, anti-tribal, and that is pro-human, going to the stars.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.821]  The book is The Big Lie, bigliebook.com.
[01:29:42.841 --> 01:29:44.722]  Dinesh D'Souza, thanks for joining us.
[01:29:44.742 --> 01:29:47.163]  Look forward to having you back on again, my friend.
[01:29:47.823 --> 01:29:48.544]  Look forward to it.
[01:29:48.924 --> 01:29:50.044]  Powerful information.
[01:29:50.444 --> 01:29:52.305]  And we have another special guest joining us straight ahead.
[01:29:54.366 --> 01:29:55.666]  Empires on the Run.
[01:29:56.587 --> 01:29:59.408]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.469 --> 01:30:15.593]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[01:30:15.773 --> 01:30:23.136]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWars Life family, true whey protein from InfoWars Life.
[01:30:23.476 --> 01:30:29.403]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high-quality organic conditions.
[01:30:29.984 --> 01:30:36.711]  Our True Whey Protein from Infowars Life contains a whopping 20 grams of protein per serving.
[01:30:37.172 --> 01:30:44.340]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:57.189]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies to bring you a super high quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[01:30:57.689 --> 01:31:05.255]  That way you get the benefits and the taste of high quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[01:31:05.575 --> 01:31:08.076]  Doing our research, one thing continued to really stand out.
[01:31:08.637 --> 01:31:17.321]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:18.542]  That is essential.
[01:31:18.922 --> 01:31:23.225]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[01:31:23.705 --> 01:31:26.126]  This is the very best whey that we were able to bring to market.
[01:31:26.506 --> 01:31:28.207]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[01:31:28.227 --> 01:31:29.968]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.
[01:31:30.488 --> 01:31:33.030]  It is true whey from m4warslife.com.
[01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:37.993]  We have private labeled it, and it is the exact same product, just the name is different.
[01:31:38.173 --> 01:31:39.034]  Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:31:39.374 --> 01:31:41.295]  It's on average 20% off.
[01:31:41.575 --> 01:31:46.759]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 25% off.
[01:31:47.379 --> 01:31:56.505]  Emmerich's Essentials is all about personal care, hygiene, not getting skin cancer, not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and mosquitoes.
[01:31:57.005 --> 01:31:57.966]  It's all there.
[01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:02.889]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:32:03.069 --> 01:32:11.737]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:32:11.797 --> 01:32:12.258]  That's right.
[01:32:12.338 --> 01:32:17.343]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.
[01:32:17.603 --> 01:32:24.029]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[01:32:24.269 --> 01:32:31.570]  And let me tell you, son, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:32.050]  Woo!
[01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:33.011]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:41.732]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:32:41.872 --> 01:32:49.914]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:32:51.454 --> 01:32:54.776]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:32:54.896 --> 01:32:58.879]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:32:59.019 --> 01:32:59.939]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:33:00.079 --> 01:33:02.661]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:20.961]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:21.402 --> 01:33:26.585]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:30.427 --> 01:33:40.014]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up at the start of the next hour, we have James Wesley Rawls popping in for 30 minutes, then Mark Goldman is also going to be
[01:33:41.289 --> 01:33:43.930]  Joining us, we just had Dinesh D'Souza on.
[01:33:44.690 --> 01:33:48.612]  I want to get into some of the geopolitical news.
[01:33:49.512 --> 01:33:50.892]  I want to get into some of the tech news.
[01:33:50.932 --> 01:33:51.733]  It's really important.
[01:33:51.753 --> 01:33:58.375]  They've introduced legislation to not let your appliances spy on you with cameras and microphones.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.603]  And yes, a lot of them have cameras and microphones built in, but that's only the beginning.
[01:34:03.943 --> 01:34:08.066]  They can dial into your other computers that do have cameras and microphones.
[01:34:08.126 --> 01:34:14.771]  So your dishwasher doesn't have a camera and microphone, but it's got a digital antenna that will pick it up and then transmit it.
[01:34:15.271 --> 01:34:15.971]  Get ready for this.
[01:34:16.172 --> 01:34:19.834]  Off another antenna or down your power line.
[01:34:21.536 --> 01:34:22.756]  Data over power line.
[01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:24.998]  I told everybody this 20 plus years ago.
[01:34:25.018 --> 01:34:25.638]  They didn't believe me.
[01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:26.739]  I showed you all the documents.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.280]  It's now mainstream news.
[01:34:29.286 --> 01:34:35.472]  And they have waited to tell you about this in the Hill newspaper until it's already in place.
[01:34:37.394 --> 01:34:51.888]  And that's an algorithm I've noticed, where they only tell you about it once it's in place, to then pass some regulations so only the government can do it, and then pose as the saviors over what they've designed on purpose.
[01:34:54.073 --> 01:35:03.820]  And I sit here and I watch this and I learn this and then decades later I read white papers saying exactly what I'd already said myself.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:10.645]  Because once you learn their philosophy, once you learn their operations, you've got them down.
[01:35:11.946 --> 01:35:13.667]  They operate like you're an idiot.
[01:35:14.788 --> 01:35:15.369]  Remember Gruber?
[01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:22.514]  He said, thank God you're so stupid.
[01:35:27.003 --> 01:35:39.966]  Think, heaven, you don't realize that Obamacare was written as a tax to private insurance companies to make the biggest profits they've ever made in the last five years.
[01:35:41.586 --> 01:35:44.666]  You wonder why the Republican leadership didn't shoot down Obamacare?
[01:35:44.686 --> 01:35:45.447]  Because they wrote it.
[01:35:48.267 --> 01:35:52.248]  And the Democrats run around giggling like, Trump loss, Trump loss, failure, failure.
[01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:55.310]  Ding dong, the witch is dead.
[01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:56.190]  The witch, oh witch.
[01:35:56.290 --> 01:35:57.031]  The witch, witch, witch.
[01:35:57.331 --> 01:35:59.811]  Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead.
[01:36:04.192 --> 01:36:06.772]  We represent the Lollipop Guild.
[01:36:06.992 --> 01:36:08.333]  The Lollipop Guild.
[01:36:08.553 --> 01:36:09.693]  The Lollipop Guild.
[01:36:10.733 --> 01:36:13.133]  We represent the Lollipop Guild.
[01:36:13.153 --> 01:36:21.615]  And I look at the Democrats and I go, you understand the Republican leadership wrote this to the Democrats and foreign banks to rape you.
[01:36:25.421 --> 01:36:27.442]  They go, thought you said it was insurance companies.
[01:36:27.562 --> 01:36:29.303]  And I went, that's who owns those, yes.
[01:36:30.024 --> 01:36:34.066]  Now you do understand they're ruthless and they wanted a corporate direct tax to them.
[01:36:34.346 --> 01:36:39.189]  That's what the carbon tax is and the wellhead and the digital tax, the Tobin tax.
[01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:42.832]  And they go, oh, talking fancy, trying to impress me.
[01:36:43.372 --> 01:36:45.293]  And I'm going, no, I'm your fellow human.
[01:36:45.373 --> 01:36:48.155]  I don't want to be a predator and join the elite and feed on you.
[01:36:49.199 --> 01:36:50.639]  Sure, you're trying to impress me.
[01:36:51.319 --> 01:36:54.520]  I'm like, no, I morally cannot do this to you.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:00.501]  But instead of you just being fed on, you join the globalists to then help destroy me as well.
[01:37:00.801 --> 01:37:02.882]  So I really need you to wake up.
[01:37:04.302 --> 01:37:04.982]  But they don't care.
[01:37:05.702 --> 01:37:06.823]  They're delusional.
[01:37:08.503 --> 01:37:13.124]  People have been brought up in such an artificial world, they learn how to make believe.
[01:37:14.844 --> 01:37:16.205]  And the mental illness is getting worse.
[01:37:16.265 --> 01:37:17.345]  I see it in more and more people.
[01:37:18.476 --> 01:37:26.899]  Where they can't work, they can't do jobs, they just walk around like zombies, and they just fantasize about how big and powerful they are.
[01:37:28.279 --> 01:37:33.421]  And the mental illness is just exploding, society is disintegrating.
[01:37:35.822 --> 01:37:46.586]  And then like giant zombie hordes, with all their tics and all their weirdnesses and all their bizarre behaviors, the swarms of dysfunctional
[01:37:47.654 --> 01:37:49.715]  Are just rising up like a plague.
[01:37:53.837 --> 01:37:59.659]  And they click and they cluck and they jibber and they just look completely mentally ill.
[01:38:03.641 --> 01:38:14.546]  But the computers and the robots and the automation keep producing them the food and the producing humans keep producing them a culture that they can then walk around on and judge and get mad at and demand things.
[01:38:15.794 --> 01:38:16.494]  I don't know.
[01:38:42.895 --> 01:38:45.417]  Millennials are entitled, narcissistic, and lazy.
[01:38:46.137 --> 01:38:47.078]  But it's not their fault.
[01:38:47.778 --> 01:38:53.802]  Expert claims every child wins a prize and social media has left Generation Y unable to deal with the real world.
[01:38:54.103 --> 01:39:01.848]  And they all fantasize that they are this ascendant super being that knows everything and is smarter than everyone.
[01:39:08.257 --> 01:39:16.039]  And they're fine to be around until they stub their toe, or until they get a flat tire, or until everything doesn't go just the way they want.
[01:39:16.339 --> 01:39:19.040]  And it's like being around a cult, or studying a cult.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.301]  You watch old videos of those ashrams and new age cults and stuff.
[01:39:23.321 --> 01:39:24.681]  Everyone's like, it's beautiful!
[01:39:24.701 --> 01:39:25.381]  We're all enlightened!
[01:39:25.861 --> 01:39:26.681]  Oh, it's so perfect!
[01:39:27.262 --> 01:39:27.362]  Oh!
[01:39:28.062 --> 01:39:28.182]  Oh!
[01:39:28.502 --> 01:39:36.524]  Yeah, you're in the cult while you drain mama and daddy's bank account, while they're begging you to come back from California, or come back from India, or come back from wherever.
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:50.516]  And you're there on a beautiful piece of property having free love, but as soon as all that runs out or you get pregnant and you get put to work in the kitchen, your child gets taken away and it's turned into a brainwashing servant.
[01:39:50.936 --> 01:39:55.662]  And that's what all this is, is a giant cult with cult programmers.
[01:39:56.872 --> 01:40:03.865]  Like Schmidt and Zuckerberg and all of them sitting back in their own manuals and own memos, because they don't care if you learn about it.
[01:40:04.045 --> 01:40:08.554]  They think you're an animal saying, these scum, these dumb effers, when do we exterminate them?
[01:40:09.861 --> 01:40:16.925]  Well, the bioweapons tend to leech into general population, even though we've got mutagenic blockers that will protect most of us.
[01:40:17.546 --> 01:40:25.191]  There's so many humans that with seven and a half billion, if you wipe out, say, six billion, there'll be so much rioting and killing, it'll bring down civilization.
[01:40:25.571 --> 01:40:27.012]  So the answer is the soft kill.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:37.408]  With the wavelengths projected to the television and through other systems, we can get them into a trance state and just slowly raise the level of cancer, neurological disorders.
[01:40:37.888 --> 01:40:40.010]  We'll make everybody that gets the disorders rock stars.
[01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:41.732]  There'll be lots of fundraisers for them.
[01:40:41.952 --> 01:40:45.395]  We'll give them participation medals for their death.
[01:40:46.075 --> 01:40:53.602]  And then we'll just build that into the function and start phasing in the rollout of extermination, which we're now about 30 years into.
[01:40:55.321 --> 01:40:58.302]  So loving, so liberal, so trendy.
[01:40:59.102 --> 01:41:06.825]  And then the trendies tune in, and they hear it, and they just make a big joke out of it, and they have John Oliver make jokes about it.
[01:41:08.185 --> 01:41:10.866]  You notice most of these globalist operatives are not having kids.
[01:41:12.056 --> 01:41:20.520]  Because they understand the world and the future is so hellish they're building, and they're so selfish, they believe they're going to merge with machines and become gods.
[01:41:21.221 --> 01:41:24.142]  And all they are is an earlier version of the millennials.
[01:41:24.603 --> 01:41:32.707]  Super selfish, super empty, believing they're gods because they can envision human potential and what they could become
[01:41:32.967 --> 01:41:49.104]  But instead of understanding it's through being honest and good and focused and strong and going through persecution that you become transcendent and get a greater connection with God, they believe just because they can imagine the potential that they are that potential.
[01:41:50.606 --> 01:41:54.610]  And that they have realized that potential when they are fallen.
[01:41:57.011 --> 01:41:59.292]  And I don't say fallen, because the Bible said so.
[01:41:59.672 --> 01:42:08.674]  I can look at these globalists, and look at their fruits, and look at their minions, and look at them, and I can tell you, I don't want to be that elite.
[01:42:09.874 --> 01:42:10.514]  That elite.
[01:42:11.855 --> 01:42:12.815]  They are not the elite.
[01:42:13.115 --> 01:42:15.155]  They are the elite of insanity.
[01:42:15.395 --> 01:42:16.696]  The elite of unhappiness.
[01:42:16.996 --> 01:42:23.397]  The elite of stampeding around, trying to trample others, trying to find ascension.
[01:42:24.978 --> 01:42:26.498]  They are desperately scared.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:30.781]  And they will be torn to shreds.
[01:42:37.845 --> 01:42:52.993]  The delusional system is going to get worse and worse and worse as people buy into the matrix, as they buy into the false reality, as they buy into the bots, as they buy into all of it, and then are blasted out into oblivion.
[01:42:54.294 --> 01:42:56.495]  Their consciousness rendered down
[01:42:59.246 --> 01:42:59.686]  Destroy.
[01:43:01.287 --> 01:43:04.868]  And if you want to go down that path, then so be it.
[01:43:05.968 --> 01:43:09.409]  But at least you consciously have been warned up front.
[01:43:10.649 --> 01:43:16.671]  Now, before going any further, let's go to this piece of
[01:43:18.587 --> 01:43:19.988]  Eric Trump on Sean Hannity.
[01:43:20.428 --> 01:43:21.329]  Is Sean Hannity perfect?
[01:43:21.349 --> 01:43:22.070]  Is Eric Trump perfect?
[01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:22.270]  No.
[01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:28.694]  But the entire evil globalist system that's anti-human and wants a world where humans are obsolete hates them.
[01:43:29.455 --> 01:43:34.758]  Because they may be misguided in some cases, but they really do want prosperity.
[01:43:35.019 --> 01:43:40.823]  They really do get upset about the war on humanity, the war on families, the war on goodness.
[01:43:42.199 --> 01:43:49.705]  And because they prize success and goodness and strength and wealth generated by work, they are abhorred.
[01:43:53.789 --> 01:43:57.152]  They absolutely are hated by the system.
[01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:00.331]  And yes, you can only admire Trump.
[01:44:00.952 --> 01:44:07.516]  People revel in being on both sides of the fence and telling some people they hate Trump and other people they love Trump.
[01:44:07.896 --> 01:44:08.576]  Oh, do you like Trump?
[01:44:08.596 --> 01:44:09.437]  Oh, I like Trump too.
[01:44:09.797 --> 01:44:10.478]  Do you hate Trump?
[01:44:11.238 --> 01:44:12.059]  Oh, I hate him too.
[01:44:12.599 --> 01:44:15.961]  As if that's winning and getting you popular being no one.
[01:44:16.702 --> 01:44:20.944]  Playing games with other fake people that just virtue signal.
[01:44:22.225 --> 01:44:26.388]  Leadership is doing the right thing, standing up for what you believe in,
[01:44:27.355 --> 01:44:28.436]  And then moving forward.
[01:44:30.598 --> 01:44:36.703]  People today think social climbing, going along with the establishment, that somehow that gets you ahead.
[01:44:37.083 --> 01:44:39.405]  All you're giving up is your innate consciousness.
[01:44:39.765 --> 01:44:43.448]  All you're giving up is your innate imprint on the universe and the world.
[01:44:43.488 --> 01:44:45.930]  You're becoming a programmable bot.
[01:44:46.951 --> 01:44:50.154]  So that other men can live, and so you can sleep.
[01:44:50.694 --> 01:44:53.497]  Sleep your way into spiritual death.
[01:44:57.503 --> 01:44:59.404]  Sleep your way into not being conscious.
[01:45:00.064 --> 01:45:23.156]  Sleep your way into signing a contract to be mesmerized by the siren song of the deception of this world to then agree to subligate yourself and submit yourself to the most low, disastrous, fake, wicked, twisted, hungry evil the universe has ever seen.
[01:45:24.861 --> 01:45:26.524]  Soul sucking!
[01:45:27.485 --> 01:45:28.447]  In love with it!
[01:45:34.537 --> 01:45:35.178]  Here's Eric Trump.
[01:45:36.186 --> 01:45:37.067]  The media doesn't want to talk about it.
[01:45:37.087 --> 01:45:37.707]  You talk about it.
[01:45:37.727 --> 01:45:46.215]  The media doesn't want to talk about it, but you would think they would get on the bandwagon of, what, we have a stock market that's 100 points off of, you know, 22,000.
[01:45:46.295 --> 01:45:47.176]  It's already a record.
[01:45:47.196 --> 01:45:48.517]  It broke another record.
[01:45:48.737 --> 01:45:51.680]  He's broken 30 records in the last, you know, three, four months.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:52.961]  I mean, it's just skyrocketing.
[01:45:53.342 --> 01:45:56.264]  You look at oil prices and how good that is, right, for this.
[01:45:57.305 --> 01:45:57.585]  I think so.
[01:46:19.922 --> 01:46:25.926]  The only thing they're going to talk about is Anthony for the next two weeks or whatever it is.
[01:46:26.246 --> 01:46:27.927]  But they won't talk about the stock market.
[01:46:27.967 --> 01:46:29.888]  They won't talk about people's 401Ks.
[01:46:29.928 --> 01:46:31.389]  They won't talk about the economy.
[01:46:31.449 --> 01:46:32.409]  Regulation gone.
[01:46:32.449 --> 01:46:35.111]  The promise is kept.
[01:46:35.151 --> 01:46:37.412]  This country is $4 trillion richer.
[01:46:37.752 --> 01:46:40.734]  $4 trillion richer than my father in the first six months.
[01:46:41.274 --> 01:46:41.814]  I'm disappointed.
[01:46:44.776 --> 01:46:46.117]  And the deficit's going down!
[01:46:46.197 --> 01:46:47.278]  ...repeal and replace, Eric.
[01:46:47.318 --> 01:46:52.582]  Your father, as he said, you guys have made this promise now for seven years, I have a pen in hand, I'm ready to sign it.
[01:46:53.202 --> 01:47:13.097]  And the things that your father made, the promises on the campaign trail he's kept, but not only that, they've allowed this phony Russian narrative to go out for so long, but yet we've got Ukraine collusion, we got Uranium One, we got the email server scandal which we know laws were broken, you got Comey leaking, the general counsel, we learned, of the FBI last week,
[01:47:13.097 --> 01:47:13.817]  He's a phallus.
[01:47:44.838 --> 01:47:45.098]  We're good.
[01:48:02.157 --> 01:48:07.822]  It's because they're putting out fake polls, and the globalists picked the Republicans they ran the last 30-40 years to be the most empty, social-climbing nobodies.
[01:48:27.594 --> 01:48:32.457]  And so they're all up there in the power structure, and they don't like the fact that Trump's taking it away from them.
[01:48:32.737 --> 01:48:38.481]  And given the general public prosperity, they want to run it and control it, even if they're running it in the ground.
[01:48:39.761 --> 01:48:40.462]  They're globalists.
[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:48.165]  And so I see Trump carrying the country on his back with our listeners, and that's why they're trying to shoot down InfoWars.
[01:48:48.205 --> 01:48:49.726]  It's why they're trying to demoralize you.
[01:48:49.746 --> 01:48:54.971]  It's why they're trying to tell you that we're losers or we're bad, because we are saving the country.
[01:48:55.051 --> 01:48:57.272]  You, the listeners, are the heart of this.
[01:48:57.933 --> 01:48:59.334]  And Trump is delivering.
[01:48:59.434 --> 01:49:00.275]  It's insane.
[01:49:02.819 --> 01:49:04.400]  And now they're saying they want a killing.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:05.381]  They want a removing.
[01:49:05.621 --> 01:49:06.922]  They're trying to organize that.
[01:49:06.962 --> 01:49:11.405]  And we're just calmly sitting here reporting on it because it's so radical.
[01:49:11.706 --> 01:49:14.087]  How do you even report on something that crazy?
[01:49:14.888 --> 01:49:16.249]  It makes you sound crazy.
[01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:17.690]  But it's not.
[01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:18.791]  It's happening.
[01:49:18.811 --> 01:49:23.194]  We'll play the rest on the other side, but I need you to spread InfoWars.com.
[01:49:25.175 --> 01:49:28.037]  I need you to, you know, share our photos that are on our Instagram.
[01:49:28.137 --> 01:49:32.319]  I need you to share our videos, our articles, everything, like it's a war.
[01:49:32.559 --> 01:49:40.563]  This Cy Hirsch report, the most respected journalist in the world, a liberal, meeting with the FBI, meeting with the NSA, meeting with ambassadors.
[01:49:40.863 --> 01:49:43.445]  They were tracking Seth Rich.
[01:49:43.525 --> 01:49:45.426]  He's the Wikileaker, not the Russians.
[01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:47.086]  That's bombshell.
[01:49:47.207 --> 01:49:48.407]  Infowars.com.
[01:49:48.847 --> 01:49:50.068]  Zero coverage of that.
[01:49:50.968 --> 01:49:52.149]  You will get around that.
[01:49:52.249 --> 01:49:53.750]  You will get it out to talk show host.
[01:49:55.034 --> 01:49:55.774]  You will get it out.
[01:49:55.875 --> 01:49:56.935]  You will show the interest.
[01:49:57.295 --> 01:49:58.436]  You will set the narrative.
[01:49:58.476 --> 01:49:59.296]  That's what they hate.
[01:50:00.417 --> 01:50:01.378]  Get those stories out.
[01:50:02.578 --> 01:50:03.199]  It's essential.
[01:50:03.319 --> 01:50:06.400]  And Free Shipping's been running since the beginning of July.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:07.501]  It is ending today.

[01:50:19.828 --> 01:50:21.509]  We're in an incredible deal with Free Shipping.
[01:50:21.829 --> 01:50:22.049]  I think?
[01:50:51.809 --> 01:51:01.231]  I hope the mainstream media feels powerful when you know this is all going on and you do everything you can to lie about what this show broadcasts, what we cover.
[01:51:01.251 --> 01:51:07.893]  The blood of those children.
[01:51:17.938 --> 01:51:19.539]  All over the world held in captivity.
[01:51:19.859 --> 01:51:22.701]  UN caught kidnapping thousands out of Haiti alone.
[01:51:23.721 --> 01:51:25.082]  The blood is on your hands.
[01:51:25.162 --> 01:51:26.803]  Leo Zagami, let me ask you this question.
[01:51:27.403 --> 01:51:36.108]  Who is behind this global sudden wave of thousands of thousands of pedophiles per country being caught?
[01:51:36.468 --> 01:51:37.348]  10,000 plus arrests here.
[01:51:37.689 --> 01:51:44.132]  What is causing this massive move against pedophile rings that even MSM admits may bring down the Catholic Church?
[01:51:44.292 --> 01:51:51.818]  Well, it's happening and it's happening clearly in front of the whole world with George Pell, but it's also an internal conflict.
[01:51:51.938 --> 01:52:11.153]  A few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican, we had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the Holy Office, the ex-Inquisition, now known as the Congregation for the Matters of Faith, basically the headquarters of the most holy office in the Vatican.
[01:52:11.373 --> 01:52:13.094]  The police broke in and found
[01:52:13.214 --> 01:52:14.276]  We're good.
[01:52:29.275 --> 01:52:42.563]  Daniel Pell is responsible for many decades of secret plan devised by the Vatican to give the less possible money to the victims of pedophilia and manipulate them.
[01:52:42.743 --> 01:52:49.588]  And he was made a member of the C9 group, which is a group of nine cardinals.
[01:52:50.548 --> 01:52:58.656]  And three of these cardinals have been heavily criticized for having protected in the past pedophilia, including Cardinal Pell.
[01:52:59.017 --> 01:53:05.383]  So many people were actually astonished of seeing in February 2014 Cardinal Pell arriving in Rome.
[01:53:05.903 --> 01:53:12.986]  And he didn't really hide in front of the media or, you know, in front of the other people in the Vatican.
[01:53:13.026 --> 01:53:27.531]  He started immediately acting with a lavish lifestyle that, of course, brought a lot of criticism towards Pope Francis, who wants to be this very conservative pope who doesn't spend much money.
[01:53:27.671 --> 01:53:30.693]  and he's living in a modest surrounding.
[01:53:30.853 --> 01:53:39.940]  While instead, George Pell was spending money, was making all kinds of things happening that were putting really in bad light Pope Francis.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.383]  But he was not taking care of any of this criticism.
[01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:48.727]  He put him there and he basically became, after the Secretary of State, the number three in the Vatican.
[01:53:48.787 --> 01:53:57.394]  So, this is the first time in history, Alex, that such a high-ranking officer, let's say, or minister of this Vatican
[01:53:57.714 --> 01:53:59.396]  He's put in front of a trial.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:26.121]  Why wouldn't they embrace that?
[01:54:26.181 --> 01:54:29.801]  Why wouldn't they carry out... My father has the voice of this country.
[01:54:29.881 --> 01:54:31.802]  The people of this country love him.
[01:54:32.002 --> 01:54:33.122]  Why wouldn't they get in line?
[01:54:33.162 --> 01:54:37.823]  It doesn't make sense, especially... Keeping promises is good politics, Eric.
[01:54:38.203 --> 01:54:38.543]  That's right.
[01:54:38.984 --> 01:54:40.084]  You want to raise money?
[01:54:40.124 --> 01:54:40.864]  You want to do well?
[01:54:40.884 --> 01:54:41.704]  You want to get re-elected?
[01:54:41.724 --> 01:54:43.625]  How about you build the wall?
[01:54:43.685 --> 01:54:48.206]  But Sean, especially for a fundamentally broken system.
[01:54:48.666 --> 01:54:51.026]  Obamacare has gone down the tubes.
[01:54:51.126 --> 01:54:52.687]  It's a bankrupt system.
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:58.240]  This is a total
[01:55:28.499 --> 01:55:30.300]  And complete act of mind control.
[01:55:31.121 --> 01:55:33.123]  With their fake polls, just like the campaign.
[01:55:33.763 --> 01:55:36.525]  With the Republican leadership trying to block Trump at every level.
[01:55:37.106 --> 01:55:39.428]  As they're raising the most money they've ever raised.
[01:55:40.208 --> 01:55:42.550]  Republicans are winning all across the United States.
[01:55:43.971 --> 01:55:45.933]  The grassroots Republicans are thanking Trump.
[01:55:46.213 --> 01:55:47.474]  They're thanking Infowars.
[01:55:50.176 --> 01:55:52.138]  But other folks are hedging their bets.
[01:55:53.579 --> 01:55:56.281]  Because they are preparing to try to assassinate the President.
[01:55:57.907 --> 01:56:01.348]  And they still have big parts of the bureaucracy, and people are scared.
[01:56:02.648 --> 01:56:04.249]  They're scared of the CIA.
[01:56:04.949 --> 01:56:14.731]  They're scared of military special forces and all the different embedded hit teams that are in every town and city in the United States.
[01:56:15.251 --> 01:56:22.193]  The naivete of the American people's gone to that, and they think if Deep State is able to take over it again, they're going to come after everybody.
[01:56:22.213 --> 01:56:23.513]  We all better keep our heads down.
[01:56:24.413 --> 01:56:27.214]  You're going to lose everything if you act like that, folks.
[01:56:29.465 --> 01:56:31.667]  And they've been intimidating and they've been threatening Congress.
[01:56:32.368 --> 01:56:34.290]  And most of these congressmen aren't men.
[01:56:34.590 --> 01:56:35.391]  They get in line.
[01:56:36.893 --> 01:56:38.975]  But the saddest people are the Democrats.
[01:56:40.857 --> 01:56:47.944]  The Republican scum wrote Obamacare and you're defending it because you want Trump to fail when it's a huge screw job.
[01:56:48.245 --> 01:56:50.107]  What type of idiots are you?
[01:56:53.237 --> 01:57:00.560]  But again, they added 9 and 15 points on average, that was the two they would do, more Democrats to the polls.
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:01.060]  They admitted that.
[01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:02.381]  But some had 20%, 25%, 30%.
[01:57:02.701 --> 01:57:05.922]  I've told you, I've seen 34 points in CNN methodology added for Hillary.
[01:57:05.942 --> 01:57:05.922]  34!
[01:57:05.982 --> 01:57:08.763]  So when you see him in the polls,
[01:57:14.986 --> 01:57:34.362]  At 38 or whatever, know that the bots and the corporate numbers and the likeability numbers, despite all the censorship and the rest of it to try to dampen this down and them unliking Trump tweets and all the rest of it, which they admit they're doing, he's still at close to 60% with quote, likely voters.
[01:57:34.722 --> 01:57:35.683]  Well, of course he is.
[01:57:35.703 --> 01:57:38.485]  Because see, they're not fixing the polls on immigration.
[01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:39.766]  It's like 75, 80% don't want open borders.
[01:57:39.806 --> 01:57:41.007]  It's 65% of Hispanics don't want open borders.
[01:57:45.674 --> 01:57:47.055]  We tried to make it a Hispanic issue.
[01:57:47.335 --> 01:57:49.798]  Biggest group is Chinese women coming in to have their babies for free.
[01:57:50.058 --> 01:57:52.240]  Yes, that outpaces all Mexicans.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:54.882]  Chinese women coming to have their babies for free.
[01:57:55.102 --> 01:57:56.003]  And who could blame them?
[01:57:56.463 --> 01:57:59.906]  I mean, if you go to China and have your baby for free and get great health care, would you?
[01:57:59.966 --> 01:58:00.907]  I'd go to China, maybe.
[01:58:00.927 --> 01:58:02.889]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:07.193]  But remember, reliable AI systems predict Trump would win.
[01:58:08.237 --> 01:58:10.439]  Daily Presidential Poll, though, says, oh, he's in trouble.
[01:58:10.759 --> 01:58:14.583]  Artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three elections says Trump will win.
[01:58:14.903 --> 01:58:19.828]  And all those same systems show him that 60% of likely voters.
[01:58:21.633 --> 01:58:26.016]  Let's see, they've got demographics they can target, phone numbers they can target, where they can get help.
[01:58:26.056 --> 01:58:31.620]  They might say Trump's got 2% support soon, thinking you're weak-minded and will buy into peer pressure.
[01:58:31.921 --> 01:58:33.522]  Because God forbid you get a job.
[01:58:33.622 --> 01:58:35.183]  God forbid we pay off the national debt.
[01:58:35.423 --> 01:58:36.704]  God forbid we secure our borders.
[01:58:36.924 --> 01:58:39.006]  God forbid the stock market adds $4 trillion.

[02:00:18.413 --> 02:00:21.235]  We got Joe Arpaio's lawyer exclusively joining us.
[02:00:21.576 --> 02:00:24.358]  He just got found guilty of contempt.
[02:00:24.378 --> 02:00:31.064]  Defending our sovereignty.
[02:00:31.224 --> 02:00:33.126]  We've got a ton of other news to get to.
[02:00:33.346 --> 02:00:35.188]  More info on Messiah Hearst breaking news.
[02:00:35.468 --> 02:00:36.549]  The leaker discovered.
[02:00:37.802 --> 02:00:39.143]  Who leaked from a DNC?
[02:00:39.603 --> 02:00:41.184]  Surprise, surprise, it's Seth Rich.
[02:00:41.524 --> 02:00:43.225]  My story's on InfoWars.com.
[02:00:43.666 --> 02:00:44.386]  It's all coming up.
[02:00:44.466 --> 02:00:50.290]  Massive Google censorship launched against pastors, against preachers, against you name it.
[02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:55.753]  But first, I want to go to a powerful report dealing with companies promoting microchipping.
[02:00:55.773 --> 02:00:58.575]  And it turns out they did get the microchip over the weekend.
[02:00:58.895 --> 02:01:02.578]  An article showing them bleeding, all the rest of it, from this PR firm.
[02:01:02.838 --> 02:01:03.458]  But here it is.
[02:01:03.578 --> 02:01:06.000]  Mark of the Beast getting pushed right here in America.
[02:01:07.527 --> 02:01:13.089]  A woman in Australia is now a combo of Darth Vader and the Terminator, thanks to some special implants.
[02:01:13.249 --> 02:01:14.710]  Here's an x-ray of her hands.
[02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:17.210]  Those circles are microchips.
[02:01:17.391 --> 02:01:20.872]  They allow her to unlock doors without using a key.
[02:01:21.612 --> 02:01:23.172]  Kind of like the Force.
[02:01:23.673 --> 02:01:27.054]  She can also access her computer without a password.
[02:01:29.492 --> 02:01:30.713]  Problem solved.
[02:01:31.173 --> 02:01:37.316]  Many things start off with the best of intentions, but sometimes intentions turn.
[02:01:37.536 --> 02:01:41.658]  We've survived thousands of years as a species without being microchipped.
[02:01:42.318 --> 02:01:44.299]  Is there any particular need to do it now?
[02:01:44.499 --> 02:01:51.882]  Approximately 50 employees at Three Square Market, a vending machine technology company based in River Falls, Wisconsin,
[02:01:52.102 --> 02:02:04.172]  ...have decided to ignore the Book of Revelation's eugenics, the existence of the New World Order, and common sense to gleefully act as guinea pigs for the acceptance of microchip technology.
[02:02:04.452 --> 02:02:12.238]  CNET proudly reports employees of ThreeSquare won't have to worry about forgetting their employee ID cards at home anymore.
[02:02:12.538 --> 02:02:21.444]  Starting next month, a voluntary program will offer company employees the chance to get an RFID chip implanted in their hands.
[02:02:21.764 --> 02:02:37.235]  The tiny chips will use NFC near-field communication technology to allow employees to unlock doors, make vending machine purchases, log into computers, and access office tools like photocopiers, all with the wave of the hand.
[02:02:37.535 --> 02:02:40.256]  What did the employees say when you brought this idea to them?
[02:02:40.656 --> 02:02:43.398]  Half of them actually within five seconds says yes.
[02:02:43.658 --> 02:02:58.524]  What CNET doesn't tell you is that how long before one of the female employees has a chip implanted resulting in a terminated pregnancy or employees are remotely vaccinated in order to test eugenicist Bill Gates' goals.
[02:02:58.704 --> 02:03:02.766]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:03:03.246 --> 02:03:04.807]  This equation has four factors.
[02:03:05.427 --> 02:03:06.748]  A little bit of multiplication.
[02:03:07.248 --> 02:03:10.231]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[02:03:11.051 --> 02:03:24.461]  And that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[02:03:24.921 --> 02:03:29.625]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[02:03:30.425 --> 02:03:33.388]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[02:03:34.532 --> 02:03:38.133]  That's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[02:03:39.213 --> 02:03:40.693]  First, we've got population.
[02:03:41.454 --> 02:03:43.694]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[02:03:44.174 --> 02:03:45.755]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[02:03:46.375 --> 02:03:54.597]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[02:03:55.777 --> 02:04:03.198]  The BBC reports a contraceptive computer chip that can be controlled by remote control has been developed in Massachusetts.
[02:04:03.378 --> 02:04:09.119]  The chip is implanted under a woman's skin releasing a small dose of levonorgestrel, a hormone.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:15.561]  The project has been backed by Bill Gates and will be submitted for pre-clinical testing in the U.S.
[02:04:15.681 --> 02:04:18.141]  next year and possibly go on sale by 2018.
[02:04:18.461 --> 02:04:22.622]  The same technology could be used to administer other drugs
[02:04:22.722 --> 02:04:23.262]  We're good.
[02:04:38.812 --> 02:04:44.957]  With Swedish company Biohax International, which already has many chipped employees.
[02:04:45.218 --> 02:04:46.258]  Yeah, Wisconsin.
[02:04:46.539 --> 02:04:52.163]  Follow the lead from socialist replacement migration doormat of the West suite.
[02:04:52.424 --> 02:05:00.170]  Just another example of how the left will take itself down simply to prove an inevitable inhumane globalist failure.
[02:05:00.490 --> 02:05:03.213]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:05:03.633 --> 02:05:12.185]  Of the 30 plus proprietary products that we've developed for Infowarslife.com, which are all amazing, DNA Force is the flagship.

[02:07:01.786 --> 02:07:03.147]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:07:03.667 --> 02:07:12.694]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:07:12.774 --> 02:07:20.881]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:07:21.161 --> 02:07:25.863]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:07:26.043 --> 02:07:32.766]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:32.826 --> 02:07:39.908]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:07:40.008 --> 02:07:46.851]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:07:47.031 --> 02:07:51.395]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:07:51.515 --> 02:07:54.778]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:07:54.898 --> 02:08:01.044]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:08:01.204 --> 02:08:02.885]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:08:17.541 --> 02:08:28.332]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:29.794 --> 02:08:33.057]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting the Babylon system of the globalists.
[02:08:34.038 --> 02:08:34.859]  One world government.
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:37.502]  Open announcements of companies from Europe to the U.S.
[02:08:37.602 --> 02:08:39.784]  making you get microchips to basically work there.
[02:08:41.277 --> 02:08:46.964]  James Leslie Rawls, formerly of Army Intelligence, best-selling author, researcher, heads up the biggest survival blog out there.
[02:08:47.004 --> 02:08:48.546]  Survivalblog.com is our guest.
[02:08:48.907 --> 02:08:53.293]  The next 30 minutes we have Sheriff Arpaio's lawyer joining us exclusively.
[02:08:54.274 --> 02:08:59.541]  Sheriff Arpaio has been found guilty in federal court of contempt.
[02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:04.312]  We just had Dinesh D'Souza on who was put in prison for nine months for no reason.
[02:09:04.653 --> 02:09:05.953]  Now they want me put in prison.
[02:09:06.734 --> 02:09:11.237]  He's put out the book, The Big Lie, exposing the Nazi roots of the American left.
[02:09:11.297 --> 02:09:12.598]  I mean, they are the fascists.
[02:09:13.178 --> 02:09:14.980]  They call themselves the anti-fascists.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:17.081]  These people mean business.
[02:09:17.101 --> 02:09:20.063]  We're going to James Wesley Rawls here in just a moment.
[02:09:20.643 --> 02:09:22.765]  The anti-threat spirals.
[02:09:23.345 --> 02:09:29.750]  Some safe predictions of the coming unsafe era by James Wesley Rawls coming up here in just a moment.
[02:09:30.725 --> 02:09:36.327]  But before I do that, the most important thing to understand is this is an illusion that Trump's poll numbers are down.
[02:09:36.987 --> 02:09:47.792]  The scientific polls, the blogs, the bots, the AI systems, just like in the campaign show him at 60% conservatively of likely voters.
[02:09:49.072 --> 02:09:51.533]  They're just panicking because the Democrats are imploding.
[02:09:52.033 --> 02:09:55.815]  They're catching the illegals and people voting in dead people's names everywhere.
[02:09:56.215 --> 02:09:58.396]  His election commission is documenting all this.
[02:09:59.329 --> 02:10:00.770]  Their whole system is in crisis.
[02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:03.133]  The border's becoming secured, the economy's coming back.
[02:10:03.793 --> 02:10:08.337]  That's why the Republican leadership is turning against Trump, because they were put in there by the globalists.
[02:10:08.918 --> 02:10:13.122]  McCain said he'd vote against Obamacare, and he'd vote to repeal it, and he didn't.
[02:10:14.483 --> 02:10:19.068]  This is a bunch of scum realizing they're in great crisis, and it's also important
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:21.561]  To realize we're in the thick of battle.
[02:10:21.881 --> 02:10:22.721]  Spread the articles.
[02:10:22.801 --> 02:10:23.622]  Spread the videos.
[02:10:23.682 --> 02:10:26.263]  Spread our tweets at RelAlexJones.
[02:10:26.503 --> 02:10:29.385]  Spread the archives of videos we put up each day.
[02:10:29.525 --> 02:10:30.326]  It's a war.
[02:10:30.526 --> 02:10:34.448]  You may already know all this, but the public is more hungry than ever.
[02:10:35.668 --> 02:10:36.929]  And support us financially.
[02:10:36.969 --> 02:10:39.410]  We've got free shipping running for the last month.
[02:10:39.511 --> 02:10:40.431]  It ends today.
[02:10:40.991 --> 02:10:43.012]  We've got 66% off colloidal silver.
[02:10:43.353 --> 02:10:43.973]  Never done that.
[02:10:43.993 --> 02:10:47.275]  30% off ProPure, high-quality gravity-fed filters.
[02:10:47.395 --> 02:10:49.056]  AlexaPure air filtration.
[02:10:50.382 --> 02:10:56.669]  50% off our great Natural Sleep Aid Knockout with the Melatonin L-Tryptophan, Valerian Root and so much more.
[02:10:56.689 --> 02:10:59.632]  I mean, these are great deals, high quality products.
[02:11:00.073 --> 02:11:01.995]  Super Blue Toothpaste is back in stock.
[02:11:02.315 --> 02:11:06.119]  Super Blue for children that doesn't have the peppermint so it doesn't taste too strong.
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:07.260]  That's back in.
[02:11:09.122 --> 02:11:10.384]  These are amazing products.
[02:11:10.444 --> 02:11:12.186]  I mean, here's an example and then I'll quit plugging.
[02:11:14.065 --> 02:11:18.969]  Our Prosteguard, we went to one of the biggest, you know, top companies in the nation, or of organic production.
[02:11:19.009 --> 02:11:24.312]  We said, we want a strong Assault Palmetto, documented, good for your prostate and other glands.
[02:11:25.133 --> 02:11:28.655]  We want it as strong as these other big leading competitors that sell it for $40.
[02:11:30.236 --> 02:11:38.462]  But we also want to add a bunch of other known herbs and things that are good for the prostate and have it for $20 less.
[02:11:39.743 --> 02:11:41.044]  Well, it's on sale right now.
[02:11:42.210 --> 02:11:42.912]  Or even more.
[02:11:43.293 --> 02:11:44.035]  It's 1995 Prostagard.
[02:11:44.055 --> 02:11:45.660]  You cannot get a better...
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:55.662]  Over-the-counter, natural, herbal, and even the government, you know, lets you say, with salt palm meadows, documented good for your prostate.
[02:11:55.902 --> 02:11:58.903]  It's better than the drugs that are out there, you know, but it's just, it's amazing what God's given us.
[02:11:59.203 --> 02:11:59.844]  There's an example.
[02:11:59.904 --> 02:12:04.745]  The best formula out there from our research, the best ingredients, high quality, no fillers, $19.95.
[02:12:05.165 --> 02:12:05.906]  Leading competitors are $44, $49.
[02:12:05.966 --> 02:12:07.366]  I mean, it's a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:07.506 --> 02:12:07.966]  Ours is amazing.
[02:12:13.408 --> 02:12:14.228]  Same thing with knockout.
[02:12:14.809 --> 02:12:19.110]  One bottle of melatonin, the same dose as ours, three milligrams, $19.95 on average.
[02:12:20.751 --> 02:12:28.915]  Ours is $14.95 with a discount, and normally $19.95, with a bunch of other things in it that are also associated with deeper, better sleep, that all work synergistically together.
[02:12:29.195 --> 02:12:32.876]  It's $14.95 right now, 50% off the normal retail.
[02:12:35.037 --> 02:12:36.438]  So, again, great deal.
[02:12:36.518 --> 02:12:37.658]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:12:37.718 --> 02:12:38.779]  Now, going back.
[02:12:40.723 --> 02:12:42.384]  What are they gearing Antifa up?
[02:12:42.704 --> 02:12:47.466]  Why has Soros doubled the amount of money since Trump was elected in January, since he did previously?
[02:12:47.926 --> 02:12:49.087]  What are they gearing up for?
[02:12:49.127 --> 02:12:50.147]  They're calling for violence.
[02:12:50.167 --> 02:12:51.228]  They're calling for Trump's death.
[02:12:51.608 --> 02:12:53.149]  They're calling for it in mainstream news.
[02:12:54.158 --> 02:13:00.979]  They're calling, whether it's Al Gore or whether it's Clapper and Brennan, they're saying something big is about to happen.
[02:13:01.259 --> 02:13:02.160]  It's not impeachment.
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:03.160]  We're going to remove him.
[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:06.801]  We've got to bipartisanly come together for his removal.
[02:13:06.901 --> 02:13:08.681]  Don't do anything when we remove him.
[02:13:09.221 --> 02:13:11.281]  Suddenly Republican leadership is turning against Trump.
[02:13:11.902 --> 02:13:18.683]  As they raise more money than ever raised, as the Democratic Party is being made extinct, they prepare for the killer blow.
[02:13:19.443 --> 02:13:23.386]  And James Leslie Rawls, our expert to break this down, survivalblog.com.
[02:13:23.466 --> 02:13:31.731]  James, this ties into your big lengthy investigative reports, Antifa Part 1 and 2, the Antifa threat spiral.
[02:13:32.011 --> 02:13:32.992]  Break it down for us.
[02:13:33.332 --> 02:13:34.893]  What are the globalists getting ready to do?
[02:13:36.474 --> 02:13:46.381]  Well Alex, I think it's pretty clear that the Antifa movement is being used as kind of a shock troops for
[02:13:47.342 --> 02:14:00.306]  Their goal of destabilizing the government, they want to have a wave of protests followed by a wave of domestic terrorism in this country.
[02:14:01.006 --> 02:14:02.347]  They want to destabilize.
[02:14:02.907 --> 02:14:10.529]  They want to try to create a counteraction by the Trump administration.
[02:14:10.889 --> 02:14:13.170]  They're hoping for a Kent State type event.
[02:14:13.870 --> 02:14:26.180]  Where it would demoralize the American populace, turn the populace against the Trump administration, and part of their overall campaign to get Trump out of office.
[02:14:27.541 --> 02:14:32.926]  And I think that if you look at Antifa, how they were set up,
[02:14:33.889 --> 02:14:38.392]  How they interact between their cells.
[02:14:39.072 --> 02:14:47.418]  It's very similar to what we saw in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the radicalization of the anti-war movement.
[02:14:48.519 --> 02:14:54.403]  And that spun off a number of incredibly radical terrorist groups.
[02:14:55.023 --> 02:14:56.424]  A lot of them were cellular.
[02:14:57.572 --> 02:15:11.385]  Some there was some interaction between cells and in fact there was some interaction internationally with groups like the PLO and the Red Army faction in Germany, the Italian Red Brigades and so forth.
[02:15:12.106 --> 02:15:17.191]  I think we're going to see a very similar era here in the United States in the very near future.
[02:15:17.491 --> 02:15:20.394]  Well we know Black Lives Matter is fashioned after a black
[02:15:21.587 --> 02:15:25.772]  Lady who's an admitted Marxist who killed a police officer, who's a hero in Cuba today.
[02:15:25.792 --> 02:15:26.693]  She's a U.S.
[02:15:26.733 --> 02:15:28.395]  citizen living in Cuba.
[02:15:28.975 --> 02:15:36.363]  And we know that they're fashioning themselves after Saul Alinsky, who pledged allegiance to Lucifer in his opening book, Rules for Radicals.
[02:15:36.423 --> 02:15:40.768]  We know that they have fashioned themselves after the weathermen, and they've been openly preparing.
[02:15:40.808 --> 02:15:42.931]  So when you hand out the books, you teach it.
[02:15:44.025 --> 02:15:47.267]  Then you say in the media, Trump needs to die, his supporters need to die.
[02:15:47.607 --> 02:15:54.330]  You're giving direct orders, just like Al-Qaeda puts out videos and says, you know, go out, do this, here's the way you do it.
[02:15:55.130 --> 02:15:56.291]  Al-Qaeda's just as guilty.
[02:15:57.372 --> 02:15:58.152]  Well, if you look at the
[02:16:24.165 --> 02:16:38.839]  The event where James Hodgkinson shot up the baseball practice, the congressional baseball practice, and where Congressman Scalise was very gravely injured, and he'll have a very long recovery from that.
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:42.943]  I think that was just a precursor of what we're going to see.
[02:16:42.963 --> 02:16:48.068]  In the tech world, he would be called what's called an early adopter.
[02:16:49.139 --> 02:16:49.459]  Yes, right.
[02:17:11.054 --> 02:17:23.705]  Most of what we're going to see is going to be cellular, so it'll be leaderless resistance, small cells motivated politically by the George Soros's of the world.
[02:17:23.845 --> 02:17:29.550]  But because they're independent cells, they'll be very hard to penetrate by law enforcement and intelligence organizations.
[02:17:30.590 --> 02:17:34.714]  And they're going to use off-the-shelf technologies
[02:17:35.678 --> 02:17:39.621]  to inflict massive terror on the United States.
[02:17:39.961 --> 02:17:52.009]  And with the technologies that exist, it will be fairly easy, fairly inexpensive, and again, very difficult to stop because it'll be a cellular organization.
[02:17:53.570 --> 02:17:59.915]  And some of those technologies include things like off-the-shelf quadrocopter drones.
[02:18:00.915 --> 02:18:03.037]  You can go into any hobby store and buy one.
[02:18:04.131 --> 02:18:17.706]  And granted they're fairly small, but if you use a very compact explosive, or if you use a toxin, or as I described in my article, a toxin mixed with a transdermal carrier like DMSO,
[02:18:18.875 --> 02:18:30.064]  All it takes is a very small explosive charge, vaporizing a toxin that's been mixed with DMSO, and you have dozens of people dead in a 20-30 foot radius.
[02:18:30.284 --> 02:18:31.345]  Well, here's my next point.
[02:18:31.405 --> 02:18:40.352]  What does Trump, what does the American people do as they openly gear up to remove him, openly gear up from terrorism, openly start attacking people and doing stuff?
[02:18:40.392 --> 02:18:40.913]  What do we do?
[02:18:42.474 --> 02:18:44.115]  Well, the best thing that we can do is
[02:18:45.845 --> 02:18:47.987]  Still be quite active politically.
[02:18:48.387 --> 02:18:55.973]  We need to watch out for our own families, and the best thing there is to stay away from public gatherings, large public gatherings.
[02:18:56.153 --> 02:19:13.748]  And one of the things I predicted in this two-part article was that I think that the terrorist adoption of some of these technologies is going to make traditional open-air speeches by politicians a thing of the past.
[02:19:14.378 --> 02:19:19.780]  They're not going to, or even in a stadium for example, they're not going to be able to do that.
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:21.441]  It just won't be safe to do.
[02:19:22.161 --> 02:19:30.684]  Because in this next wave of terrorism, just like the bomb scares and bombings of the late 60s early 70s, we're going to see
[02:19:31.613 --> 02:19:38.319]  Quadricopter attacks on so many public gatherings that people simply won't feel safe to be there.
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:43.524]  This is the perfect thing for somebody who doesn't want to be a suicide bomber to just use a robot to do it.
[02:19:43.564 --> 02:19:44.685]  We're in the 21st century.
[02:19:45.086 --> 02:19:56.136]  Robots are so expensive they can easily carry, for a $500 drone, a four-pound package of explosives with nails on the bottom to kill a few people and create panic, or as you said, release a chemical weapon.
[02:19:56.616 --> 02:19:57.998]  And they've all been gearing up for it.
[02:19:58.058 --> 02:20:02.583]  We'll be right back on the other side, breaking down the Antifa threat spiral.
[02:20:03.223 --> 02:20:03.824]  Are you happy?
[02:20:06.447 --> 02:20:14.216]  Well, it doesn't matter if it's the Financial Times of London, or whether it's the Washington Post, or whether it's the Economist magazine or the Harvard.
[02:20:16.291 --> 02:20:20.233]  They all say globalism is collapsing, people are turning against it.
[02:20:20.513 --> 02:20:30.559]  We're not turning against internationalism, or being a citizen of the world if you want to live all over the world, or working with other countries, or accepting other cultures if you choose to adopt them.
[02:20:31.679 --> 02:20:38.882]  But we're not going to be ruled by carbon taxes that bureaucrats and Rothschilds and Rockefellers and Soroses make money from.
[02:20:38.922 --> 02:20:41.083]  It doesn't mean Brexit's perfect.
[02:20:41.103 --> 02:20:42.604]  It doesn't mean Trumpism is perfect.
[02:20:42.904 --> 02:20:47.826]  It means it's about taking the power back to the people, back to the states, back to the government.
[02:20:47.926 --> 02:20:52.828]  And Stefan Molyneux is a businessman, author, researcher, very popular radio TV host.
[02:20:53.168 --> 02:20:54.849]  Really appreciate him joining us for the next 30 minutes.
[02:20:55.189 --> 02:20:56.469]  Freedomainradio.com.
[02:20:56.749 --> 02:20:58.890]  Stefan Molyneux on Twitter.
[02:20:58.970 --> 02:21:00.131]  Freedomainradio on YouTube.
[02:21:00.771 --> 02:21:03.232]  Hundreds of millions of views, reaching tens of millions of people a week.
[02:21:03.432 --> 02:21:09.195]  Stefan Molyneux, looking at that, I mean, I don't know how to state the level of history we are at right now.
[02:21:09.255 --> 02:21:11.576]  I mean, I cannot overstate that to folks.
[02:21:11.636 --> 02:21:13.337]  We are at such an epic moment.
[02:21:13.838 --> 02:21:19.901]  It will never, ever in human history come down to as important a moment, Alex, and I really want to get this across to your listeners.
[02:21:20.501 --> 02:21:24.523]  If the state wins, if the globalists win, if the communists and the socialists win,
[02:21:25.123 --> 02:21:34.668]  Capitalism has delivered unto them such monitoring and control and video technology that it is entirely possible we will never ever be free again.
[02:21:35.088 --> 02:21:36.109]  It comes down to this.
[02:21:36.369 --> 02:21:40.791]  We have the technology to communicate free and peaceful and voluntary ideas across the world.
[02:21:41.192 --> 02:21:43.813]  They have the technology to control everything we do,
[02:21:44.053 --> 02:21:45.273]  Monitor everything we do.
[02:21:45.333 --> 02:21:48.674]  They're talking about bringing in monitoring of the internet in the UK and so on.
[02:21:49.174 --> 02:21:51.714]  If we lose, we may never ever win again.
[02:21:51.754 --> 02:21:55.015]  There won't be some big cycle of history and your great-grandkids will be free.
[02:21:55.255 --> 02:21:56.175]  It comes down to now.
[02:21:56.435 --> 02:22:00.336]  They would use every tool in their arsenal to win and they're trying it.
[02:22:00.436 --> 02:22:04.056]  We must use every legal tool in our arsenal to fight back.
[02:22:04.156 --> 02:22:05.157]  Take no prisoners.
[02:22:05.237 --> 02:22:06.717]  Push forward every agenda.
[02:22:07.117 --> 02:22:08.577]  Challenge every relationship.
[02:22:08.637 --> 02:22:11.698]  Push forward because it's now, literally, or never.
[02:22:11.798 --> 02:22:12.718]  I strongly believe.
[02:22:13.038 --> 02:22:25.042]  They're going to have a breakaway civilization, put us into total squalor, use it to control us, and then use the fruits of the human mind and open society that has given us almost godlike powers to shackle us!
[02:22:25.062 --> 02:22:27.583]  I mean, this is... this is... un...
[02:22:28.643 --> 02:22:29.784]  Unspeakably evil!
[02:22:29.804 --> 02:22:30.405]  What do we do?
[02:22:30.925 --> 02:22:31.505]  What do you do?
[02:22:31.766 --> 02:22:33.127]  You have to stop protesting.
[02:22:33.167 --> 02:22:34.488]  You have to start getting out there.
[02:22:34.508 --> 02:22:37.250]  You have to recognize that this is an emergency.
[02:22:37.290 --> 02:22:40.932]  There is no DEF CON level higher than what we are facing right now.
[02:22:40.992 --> 02:22:43.714]  You need to pull out all the stops, get all the information you can.
[02:22:44.034 --> 02:22:45.936]  You have a global communications network.
[02:22:45.956 --> 02:22:47.297]  You can tap into it anytime.
[02:22:47.337 --> 02:22:48.718]  You can challenge people in your life.
[02:22:49.178 --> 02:22:56.423]  It is down to this, because if we don't solve this peacefully, the kind of weapons that we have if it turns to war might end the entire planet.
[02:22:56.443 --> 02:22:56.503]  Wow.
[02:22:57.404 --> 02:22:58.385]  Stephan Molyneux, thank you.
[02:22:58.505 --> 02:23:01.527]  Always enlightening, but today was extremely powerful.
[02:23:01.567 --> 02:23:01.827]  Wow!
[02:23:04.289 --> 02:23:05.670]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:23:05.930 --> 02:23:07.251]  You can't survive without it.
[02:23:07.411 --> 02:23:08.332]  But where do you get it?
[02:23:08.632 --> 02:23:14.397]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:23:14.617 --> 02:23:20.341]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:23:20.521 --> 02:23:37.399]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:23:37.779 --> 02:23:39.901]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:23:40.261 --> 02:23:41.462]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:23:41.742 --> 02:23:42.503]  Easy assembly.
[02:23:42.763 --> 02:23:43.403]  Low maintenance.
[02:23:43.684 --> 02:23:45.505]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:23:58.255 --> 02:24:00.837]  Go to InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:24:23.314 --> 02:24:38.868]  Ladies and gentlemen, all over the world, the Global Crime Syndicate, led by people like George Soros, have started the Arab Spring, killed over a million people, funded the Ukrainian overthrow of an elected government, and countless other currency manipulations and other civil wars.
[02:24:38.888 --> 02:24:40.850]  So you ask, why are they so confident?
[02:24:40.890 --> 02:24:42.171]  Because they've done it before.
[02:24:43.814 --> 02:24:45.936]  But it isn't just Donald Trump operating alone.
[02:24:46.276 --> 02:24:51.620]  Patriots in our government, in the deep state, are battling the other elements of the deep state.
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:53.802]  There is a civil war in the deep state.
[02:24:55.003 --> 02:24:57.505]  But the establishment deep state has the MSM.
[02:24:58.686 --> 02:25:01.429]  But that's a weapon that really backfires on them.
[02:25:02.249 --> 02:25:07.433]  So now they're running even bigger hoaxes and attempting to try to get the public back under their control.
[02:25:07.834 --> 02:25:08.775]  I don't see it happening.
[02:25:09.522 --> 02:25:14.129]  So instead they're getting more and more and more hysterical as everything they do fails.
[02:25:14.910 --> 02:25:22.240]  And so there is an amplification, a spiral, a threat continuum acceleration.
[02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:27.682]  A threat continuum expansion, where the elites believe they're in power.
[02:25:28.182 --> 02:25:30.683]  They have a normalcy bias of being in power.
[02:25:31.183 --> 02:25:33.684]  They have a confirmation bias being around each other.
[02:25:34.464 --> 02:25:36.465]  But none of them have really ever gotten their feet wet.
[02:25:37.145 --> 02:25:39.546]  They're telling the killers to go out and start killing people.
[02:25:39.566 --> 02:25:41.227]  They're not even following the orders at this point.
[02:25:42.107 --> 02:25:44.348]  And so there's a major breakdown in the system.
[02:25:44.568 --> 02:25:46.509]  Is that a good way to put it, James Wesley Ross?
[02:25:50.551 --> 02:25:51.171]  We still have our guest?
[02:25:54.011 --> 02:25:54.932]  James, can you hear me?
[02:25:56.312 --> 02:25:59.654]  We'll get James Wesley Rawls' take on that as soon as we get his phone back on.
[02:25:59.935 --> 02:26:03.637]  He was having Skype problems and phone problems today at his home.
[02:26:04.637 --> 02:26:13.142]  Now, we sit here at the precipice and we release such bombshells on a daily basis, I don't think people understand why the enemy hates us.
[02:26:13.523 --> 02:26:16.664]  They know if you ever really start paying attention, it's over.
[02:26:17.545 --> 02:26:19.446]  We broke that Obama stole 90
[02:26:23.311 --> 02:26:26.052]  $290 plus billion dollars from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[02:26:26.392 --> 02:26:34.796]  We are putting out and pushing that Si Hirsch is out there being interviewed and no one else is picking this up saying we know who the DNC leaker was.
[02:26:34.836 --> 02:26:36.617]  It was Seth Rich and then he gives the evidence.
[02:26:36.677 --> 02:26:38.918]  This is bombshell information.
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:43.941]  James Leslie Rawls looking at their escalation.
[02:26:44.281 --> 02:26:45.462]  Look at how they're failing.
[02:26:46.693 --> 02:26:50.697]  Well, I think in the near future, we're going to see the wave of terrorism that I described.
[02:27:01.583 --> 02:27:14.493]  And it may be analogous to what we saw in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and 70s, where you have the so-called official side of the IRA.
[02:27:15.333 --> 02:27:20.337]  The political side of it was encapsulated in an organization called Sinn Féin.
[02:27:21.257 --> 02:27:24.360]  And Sinn Féin was the political side.
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:25.661]  They actually
[02:27:26.585 --> 02:27:38.330]  Uh, claim to, uh, disavow any contact or any control or any cooperation with terrorists, that they were all part of the same organization.
[02:27:38.970 --> 02:27:50.275]  I think we could see the same thing develop here in the States with the mainstream Antifa, uh, movement being political, and then you have dozens of splinter groups
[02:27:51.039 --> 02:27:57.041]  Which are officially disavowed by the main portion of Antifa.
[02:27:57.681 --> 02:28:00.762]  But they'll be, you know, conjoined at the hip.
[02:28:00.822 --> 02:28:02.063]  They'll be all the same people.
[02:28:02.083 --> 02:28:06.945]  Well they're already burning things and beating people and attacking people and hospitalizing and calling for everybody's death.
[02:28:07.345 --> 02:28:08.625]  And clearly it's escalating.
[02:28:08.985 --> 02:28:13.047]  What is the flashpoint where it's openly being called terrorism and how bad do you think it'll get?
[02:28:13.087 --> 02:28:13.827]  What's the timetable?
[02:28:14.577 --> 02:28:33.054]  Well, I think that with the off-the-shelf technologies that exist, and especially with, unfortunately, the NSA releasing into the wild their hacking tool set, any of those hacking tools could be used for an attack on public utilities, for example.
[02:28:34.115 --> 02:28:37.118]  And we could see an attack on the SCADA systems.
[02:28:38.161 --> 02:28:39.202]  James, let me ask you this.
[02:28:55.114 --> 02:29:11.727]  Well, a lot of other top analysts agree with you, and in closing, we see in the data dumps of WikiLeaks as of late, and others, Vault 7 of the CIA, how they're framing Russia and others, but Russia particularly, with cyber attacks run by leftist Deep State,
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:18.307]  Like Reality Winner and others that are Wahhabis back against the United States to blame Russia.
[02:29:18.627 --> 02:29:28.102]  I'm really concerned about cyber false flags carried out by minions of Clapper and others, Brennan and others, to then be blamed on Russia as a provocation.
[02:29:29.526 --> 02:29:35.791]  Well, yes, the false flag could point to Russia, or the false flag could point at American patriots.
[02:29:36.531 --> 02:29:38.413]  It's just a matter of who they want to set up.
[02:29:38.513 --> 02:29:43.276]  There'll be convenient patsies that they'll be able to set up very easily.
[02:29:44.277 --> 02:29:48.900]  Because, let's face it, it's a purely cyber environment.
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:53.523]  They can create a trail to whatever server they want to create.
[02:29:53.543 --> 02:29:54.864]  It's perfect frame-up territory.
[02:29:54.884 --> 02:29:55.645]  Thank you, James.
[02:29:56.528 --> 02:29:59.290]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.530 --> 02:30:01.431]  Joe Arpaio's Lawyers, up next.
[02:30:04.373 --> 02:30:07.895]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[02:30:08.355 --> 02:30:14.419]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[02:30:14.799 --> 02:30:17.601]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:17.981 --> 02:30:21.003]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:30:21.183 --> 02:30:24.645]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[02:30:24.966 --> 02:30:25.406]  The left
[02:30:26.566 --> 02:30:36.389]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:30:36.449 --> 02:30:38.850]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:43.191]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:30:43.251 --> 02:30:51.313]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:30:51.573 --> 02:30:54.274]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[02:30:54.674 --> 02:30:57.819]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[02:30:57.899 --> 02:30:59.601]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[02:30:59.761 --> 02:31:00.943]  It's available right now.
[02:31:01.244 --> 02:31:03.807]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:10.296]  Every article, every video, but especially these articles and videos, we've been breaking down.
[02:31:11.914 --> 02:31:18.479]  Dealing with the martial law, civil war, assassination, removal, sudden removal, coup of Trump.
[02:31:18.980 --> 02:31:20.861]  All of this is now confirmed.
[02:31:21.222 --> 02:31:24.104]  Talk about sensationally fantastic.
[02:31:25.485 --> 02:31:27.166]  Talk about living in incredible times.
[02:31:27.246 --> 02:31:30.469]  Talk about America and the world at the crossroads.
[02:31:30.509 --> 02:31:30.989]  This is it.
[02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:34.612]  And now, more than ever, we need your financial support.
[02:31:34.672 --> 02:31:36.653]  We have the very best products you need.
[02:31:37.074 --> 02:31:39.575]  Incredible air filtration systems that are $219.
[02:31:39.615 --> 02:31:39.976]  Similar units are $400, $600.
[02:31:40.056 --> 02:31:41.236]  Used to be like $800 a few years ago.
[02:31:41.256 --> 02:31:42.157]  The prices are going down.
[02:31:42.177 --> 02:31:42.657]  They're $149 right now.
[02:31:49.722 --> 02:31:51.103]  $149, normally $219.
[02:31:51.503 --> 02:31:53.344]  That is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:31:53.464 --> 02:31:56.426]  The very same type systems, again, are $400 on average, upwards of $600.
[02:31:56.586 --> 02:31:59.788]  ProPure Travel are the very best gravity-fed systems out there.
[02:31:59.808 --> 02:31:59.888]  30% off, $132.
[02:32:00.148 --> 02:32:03.089]  The other competitors aren't even as good, and they sell them for $200, $230.
[02:32:03.149 --> 02:32:03.570]  That's $132 right now.
[02:32:07.972 --> 02:32:12.055]  Super Silver Special, the electric toothbrush that has silver impregnated in it, amazing.
[02:32:12.215 --> 02:32:15.077]  And the Ployol Silver toothpaste, super blue.
[02:32:15.237 --> 02:32:18.180]  And the Silver Bullet Ployol Silver, 50% off.
[02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:19.500]  We've never done a special that big.
[02:32:19.861 --> 02:32:21.442]  Caveman Combo, 25% off.
[02:32:21.462 --> 02:32:24.424]  The Bone Broth, Super Female, 57% off.
[02:32:24.484 --> 02:32:25.105]  And why is that?
[02:32:25.185 --> 02:32:27.206]  Because we're basically sold out of the Super Male.
[02:32:27.306 --> 02:32:28.247]  I can't discount that.
[02:32:28.527 --> 02:32:31.329]  Super Female is very, very similar and works on men as well.
[02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:32.230]  But I want women.
[02:32:32.250 --> 02:32:33.791]  They're really caught on with women for some reason.
[02:32:33.991 --> 02:32:34.271]  We should.
[02:32:34.391 --> 02:32:37.152]  It's even more dramatic than what I've seen in women, when it comes to libido at least.
[02:32:37.392 --> 02:32:39.412]  But stamina, energy, just read the reviews.
[02:32:39.612 --> 02:32:43.273]  Super female, 57% off, and so many other big specials.
[02:32:43.293 --> 02:32:44.493]  DNA 4, 20% off.
[02:32:44.813 --> 02:32:46.754]  Free shipping until the end of this month.
[02:32:46.994 --> 02:32:50.574]  That's only a few more days, and the huge sales of July are over.
[02:32:50.834 --> 02:32:57.156]  Please support the broadcast, support yourself, and help fund the InfoWar in the face of this oppressive assault, because we're having victory.
[02:32:57.256 --> 02:32:59.256]  InfoWarStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:32:59.276 --> 02:32:59.936]  Thanks for your support.
[02:33:14.180 --> 02:33:15.201]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:15.281 --> 02:33:19.104]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.464 --> 02:33:24.548]  There I was, completely wasted, out of work and down.
[02:33:24.789 --> 02:33:32.735]  All excited, so frustrated, as I'm drivin' town to town.
[02:33:49.742 --> 02:33:50.723]  If you did,
[02:34:17.637 --> 02:34:19.018]  Doing the same thing, too.
[02:34:20.299 --> 02:34:22.961]  Well, we had another political prisoner on earlier.
[02:34:22.981 --> 02:34:27.544]  Dinesh D'Souza headed up an entire cabinet position for Ronald Reagan.
[02:34:28.444 --> 02:34:29.285]  No criminal record.
[02:34:29.305 --> 02:34:30.486]  He got five of his friends.
[02:34:30.506 --> 02:34:33.568]  I think a political contribution to one of his other friends.
[02:34:34.188 --> 02:34:37.250]  And they said, well, you didn't sign some paperwork.
[02:34:37.691 --> 02:34:40.553]  You're going to spend nine months in prison, federal prison.
[02:34:41.468 --> 02:34:45.209]  Well, now he's put out the big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American left.
[02:34:45.249 --> 02:34:45.869]  He was on earlier.
[02:34:46.290 --> 02:34:48.070]  Guess who else they want to make a political prisoner?
[02:34:49.351 --> 02:35:00.934]  Former federal agent, long-running sheriff, no criminal records, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, found guilty of contempt to a judge who's been in the hip pocket of the Democrats.
[02:35:01.434 --> 02:35:02.615]  This is incredible.
[02:35:04.189 --> 02:35:08.992]  This is Arpaio vindicated, arresting illegals that committed felony crimes, you name it.
[02:35:09.873 --> 02:35:12.434]  Arrested illegals that chopped people's heads off.
[02:35:12.494 --> 02:35:15.876]  I mean, he tried to stop the crime that's in Mexico from coming here.
[02:35:16.377 --> 02:35:24.162]  And now George Soros, Bloomberg, you name it, spent tens of millions to get him removed there out of Maricopa County.
[02:35:25.404 --> 02:35:27.986]  Kind of a bellwether of everything, but we've now seen.
[02:35:28.386 --> 02:35:34.470]  And so now they're trying to put him in jail and make him a political prisoner as well.
[02:35:34.530 --> 02:35:40.254]  Mark Goldman is one of the founders of Goldman and Zwillinger law firm that focuses on commercial litigation.
[02:35:41.135 --> 02:35:45.017]  He served as an adjunct professor of law, teaching constitutional law and legal writing.
[02:35:45.057 --> 02:35:50.881]  Also, he served as special assistant county attorney for Maricopa County, Arizona, licensed attorney since 88.
[02:35:51.181 --> 02:35:54.203]  Mark represents high profile clients with expertise in
[02:35:55.904 --> 02:35:56.725]  Public Relations.
[02:35:57.946 --> 02:36:15.578]  GZLawOffice.com is their site, and he is Arpaio's lawyer, here to break down what's been called a kangaroo court, a kangaroo ruling, and again they're in the news saying, I need to be arrested as a Russian spy with no evidence, and the president as well, so they want to put us all in jail.
[02:36:16.278 --> 02:36:17.519]  What's really going on here, Mark?
[02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:23.923]  This is a political lynching of a
[02:36:25.464 --> 02:36:36.041]  Dedicated law enforcement officer who has served his country and the people of Arizona for many years with an impeccable record.
[02:36:36.862 --> 02:36:38.725]  And it's just a travesty.
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:44.282]  Let's break down the facts because folks want us to go out.
[02:36:44.302 --> 02:36:50.566]  They want Trump to go out as family and to go out and fight for our sovereignty and to not let unvetted radical Muslims in.
[02:36:51.206 --> 02:36:53.348]  And then once we do it, they're trying to kill Trump.
[02:36:53.368 --> 02:36:54.508]  They're trying to remove him from office.
[02:36:54.548 --> 02:36:56.750]  They're trying to put people in prison.
[02:36:56.930 --> 02:36:58.050]  I mean, they come after folks.
[02:36:58.090 --> 02:37:05.515]  So now is the time to understand what happened to Joe Arpaio and how we can, you know, hopefully support him.
[02:37:05.575 --> 02:37:06.656]  So lay out
[02:37:08.090 --> 02:37:08.911]  We've got some time here.
[02:37:08.971 --> 02:37:10.332]  Exactly what happened to him?
[02:37:10.632 --> 02:37:12.193]  Because I mean, I was following it in the news.
[02:37:12.614 --> 02:37:13.734]  Unprecedented actions.
[02:37:14.915 --> 02:37:15.135]  Right.
[02:37:15.336 --> 02:37:22.761]  This was the timeline leading up to this doesn't lie.
[02:37:23.441 --> 02:37:26.384]  And it speaks for itself.
[02:37:26.404 --> 02:37:30.887]  11 days before the Arizona primary last August,
[02:37:32.867 --> 02:37:38.692]  For which, which included the sheriff's primary race, which was contested.
[02:37:39.893 --> 02:37:48.580]  In the Arizona primary for sheriff, where Sheriff Arpaio was running for his seventh four year term in office.
[02:37:50.922 --> 02:37:55.766]  A federal judge who had been handling one of the cases in which the sheriff was involved.
[02:37:57.267 --> 02:37:59.769]  Coincidentally, referred the matter
[02:38:00.891 --> 02:38:03.833]  For criminal contempt prosecution.
[02:38:05.795 --> 02:38:11.359]  To the US Attorney's Office and to the court to the federal court.
[02:38:11.819 --> 02:38:15.282]  This was again 11 days prior.
[02:38:17.023 --> 02:38:21.186]  To the primary election, just coincidental, of course, then.
[02:38:21.206 --> 02:38:23.107]  Yeah, then.
[02:38:24.428 --> 02:38:27.731]  The sheriff won the primary election and then.
[02:38:29.528 --> 02:38:38.969]  Two weeks to the day prior to the general election in which the sheriff was now running in the in the primary.
[02:38:41.038 --> 02:38:42.158]  It's okay.
[02:38:42.178 --> 02:38:42.578]  It's Skype.
[02:38:42.658 --> 02:38:43.038]  It's live.
[02:38:43.058 --> 02:38:45.679]  People love to sometimes dogs or folks knock on the door.
[02:38:45.699 --> 02:38:46.399]  It absolutely happens.
[02:38:46.439 --> 02:38:48.700]  And just while you're getting that, just expand on this.
[02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:52.160]  We've seen the Ninth Circuit say you can't have American flags in school.
[02:38:52.921 --> 02:38:57.702]  The same Ninth Circuit said that he couldn't, you know, control people from places like Somalia.
[02:38:58.122 --> 02:38:59.202]  And you have other courts ruling.
[02:38:59.222 --> 02:39:00.542]  The Supreme Court struck that down.
[02:39:00.822 --> 02:39:05.143]  But we've seen incredible judicial tyranny by the Democrats the last few years.
[02:39:05.483 --> 02:39:08.424]  I mean, it is frightening the types of things they do.
[02:39:08.484 --> 02:39:09.044]  Please continue.
[02:39:10.356 --> 02:39:12.217]  Yeah, so this matter.
[02:39:13.652 --> 02:39:29.421]  Coincidentally, of course, two weeks to the day prior to the general election, the court issues its show cause order, ordering Sheriff Arpaio to show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt of court.
[02:39:29.922 --> 02:39:34.044]  Again, coincidentally, two days to the day before the general election.
[02:39:34.484 --> 02:39:40.448]  And this matter was pursued by the Department of Justice under the Obama administration.
[02:39:40.468 --> 02:39:42.249]  The same folks that meet on tarmacs with Bill Clinton.
[02:39:43.357 --> 02:39:52.800]  Exactly, the exact same people under the exact same Attorney General who met with Bill Clinton, coincidentally, at the Phoenix Airport.
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:40:01.282]  This is the same Justice Department that Congressman Steve King and others are saying need to be criminally investigated for all the things they've done.
[02:40:02.503 --> 02:40:10.385]  Yes, and again, this was the same Justice Department that clearly initiated this.
[02:40:11.696 --> 02:40:22.252]  Concurrent with an election which was which to which there had been a huge public outcry when Comey
[02:40:25.450 --> 02:40:35.257]  took action, and the FBI is under the Department of Justice, when he took action regarding Hillary Clinton shortly before the presidential election.
[02:40:35.317 --> 02:40:37.279]  And people were saying, oh, that's terrible.
[02:40:37.659 --> 02:40:44.083]  The Justice Department has a policy that they will not take this sort of action prior to an election.
[02:40:44.304 --> 02:40:51.489]  Well, gee whiz, they took this action right before, coincidentally, right before Sheriff Arpaio's general election.
[02:40:53.601 --> 02:40:53.961]  Wow.
[02:40:54.942 --> 02:41:00.706]  Let's continue now up to the trial and the so-called conviction, all the rest of it.
[02:41:00.746 --> 02:41:14.417]  Yeah, well, my law firm stepped into this case late in the game and we filed several motions, pre-trial motions.
[02:41:15.277 --> 02:41:17.339]  Every single one of them was denied.
[02:41:20.061 --> 02:41:21.022]  Let's see, we also
[02:41:22.133 --> 02:41:32.842]  We even filed a motion just to stop the trial for a brief period of time because it was going to overlap with my only son's Bar Mitzvah.
[02:41:33.483 --> 02:41:34.584]  And no dice.
[02:41:34.844 --> 02:41:38.367]  We couldn't even get that courtesy from the government or the court.
[02:41:40.709 --> 02:41:45.974]  The government had the audacity to argue that it's just a one-day social event, so who cares?
[02:41:48.036 --> 02:41:51.239]  In any event, as I said, we got into the game late.
[02:41:51.499 --> 02:42:09.734]  This was pursued by the very same, contrary to fake news and false media reports, this was pursued by the Justice Department, although under Sessions, by the very same attorneys that were pursuing it during the Obama administration.
[02:42:11.396 --> 02:42:13.818]  I sent a letter directly to Sessions.
[02:42:15.019 --> 02:42:29.669]  And before the trial, explaining to him that this case was being brought forward and prosecuted under the wrong statute, which it was and has been and continues to be.
[02:42:31.170 --> 02:42:37.675]  The Justice Department used a statute and the court sanctioned it that
[02:42:38.795 --> 02:42:51.941]  Is inapplicable to the facts of this case, and had they used the correct statute, there wouldn't have been a trial because that statute provides for a one-year statute of limitations, which had expired.
[02:42:52.402 --> 02:43:00.906]  And even if the one-year statute of limitations had arguably not expired, that statute provides in
[02:43:05.286 --> 02:43:12.313]  Uh, unambiguous terms and exact terms that the sheriff was entitled to a jury trial.
[02:43:13.514 --> 02:43:19.641]  And needless to say, as we all know now, the sheriff was denied a jury trial in this matter.
[02:43:19.701 --> 02:43:22.383]  That's why I said, tell us about the trial because he wasn't allowed to have one.
[02:43:23.464 --> 02:43:24.846]  He was given a kangaroo hearing.
[02:43:25.987 --> 02:43:26.347]  Well, sure.
[02:43:26.407 --> 02:43:26.788]  I mean this.
[02:43:27.845 --> 02:43:36.568]  This was a criminal referral by one judge in a federal court to another judge in the same federal court.
[02:43:37.228 --> 02:43:44.011]  It's similar to asking like a victim to try a case to be the... By the way, I'm not a lawyer like you.
[02:43:44.211 --> 02:43:51.133]  Isn't it in the Constitution that if your life's in jeopardy or you're facing jail time, that by law you can demand a jury trial?
[02:43:52.633 --> 02:43:54.714]  It is, however, it has been narrowed.
[02:43:54.874 --> 02:43:57.115]  That has been narrowed by the Supreme Court.
[02:43:58.363 --> 02:44:07.877]  Certainly by the it has been narrowed and it is not to today unless the Supreme Court overrules itself.
[02:44:08.621 --> 02:44:10.982]  Which they should do in that matter.
[02:44:11.062 --> 02:44:13.403]  So where are we going here and what can we do for Sheriff Arpaio?
[02:44:13.423 --> 02:44:14.383]  Because he's a champion.
[02:44:14.723 --> 02:44:15.684]  He could have rolled over.
[02:44:15.704 --> 02:44:17.404]  He had the UN come after him.
[02:44:17.424 --> 02:44:18.605]  He got all these lawsuits.
[02:44:19.065 --> 02:44:20.145]  They tried to destroy him.
[02:44:20.285 --> 02:44:21.466]  All because he followed the law.
[02:44:21.966 --> 02:44:27.048]  800 plus cities are sanctuary cities where they let criminals, you know, be deported 20 times, rapist, murderers.
[02:44:27.508 --> 02:44:31.529]  The media always exaggerates it and acts like he was grabbing kids off the street, which he wasn't.
[02:44:31.549 --> 02:44:32.330]  He followed the law.
[02:44:33.410 --> 02:44:34.491]  Now they're trying to throw him in jail.
[02:44:34.911 --> 02:44:40.054]  I mean, clearly, Trump is mad at Sessions because Sessions is intimidated.
[02:44:40.154 --> 02:44:41.275]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:44:41.715 --> 02:44:43.076]  All these crimes are being committed.
[02:44:43.096 --> 02:44:44.237]  They're trying to bring down Trump.
[02:44:45.698 --> 02:44:53.503]  People say, well, Trump could, you know, pardon Arpaio, but I guess Arpaio simply is appealing right now, wanting a jury trial.
[02:44:54.637 --> 02:44:55.217]  Exactly.
[02:44:55.557 --> 02:45:00.119]  We have a pending petition before the U.S.
[02:45:00.179 --> 02:45:14.323]  Supreme Court, and contrary again to the fake news, which has reported that the petition was denied by the Supreme Court, it was never denied by the Supreme Court, and it is still pending before the Supreme Court to this day.
[02:45:14.403 --> 02:45:20.545]  The only thing that the Supreme Court denied was our request for an expedited
[02:45:21.662 --> 02:45:24.784]  A ruling or a stay of the trial.
[02:45:25.324 --> 02:45:42.754]  The Supreme Court denied that back in June but it never denied the petition and it's sitting there right before the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court can take action now, tomorrow, next week, next month, reversing this whole matter solely based on the clear
[02:45:44.497 --> 02:45:46.881]  Well, I mean, if he doesn't get the appeal, what is he facing?
[02:46:00.161 --> 02:46:08.448]  The ruling in this case as well, because we argue that there are many... Sure, but that's why I raised the Ninth Circuit, is because I know that you guys are under that.
[02:46:08.868 --> 02:46:12.010]  That is, you know, the most reversed court out there, 80-plus percent of the time.
[02:46:12.030 --> 02:46:18.295]  I mean, I know you don't want prejudice for him saying bad things about him, but, I mean, you talk about cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[02:46:19.456 --> 02:46:19.676]  Right.
[02:46:20.317 --> 02:46:29.384]  The only thing that I can say about the Ninth Circuit for the record is that I am very hopeful that the Ninth Circuit will follow
[02:46:30.228 --> 02:46:32.370]  Sure, but if they don't, what is Arpaio facing?
[02:46:45.481 --> 02:47:07.937]  He faces up to six months in prison and at one time discussing this matter with the head of the public integrity section of the Department of Justice that's prosecuting this matter and get this this this is the public integrity section of the Department of Justice which is using the wrong statute to prosecute Sheriff Arpaio and they said they want
[02:47:09.533 --> 02:47:20.264]  It'll just make you more of a hero.
[02:47:20.424 --> 02:47:22.166]  I mean, he is so demonized.
[02:47:22.206 --> 02:47:23.868]  And again, I get demonized.
[02:47:24.528 --> 02:47:27.832]  There's not many of us in this club that get lied about and demonized and misrepresented.
[02:47:29.332 --> 02:47:32.953]  They've had court rulings, and then the media says I lost my kids.
[02:47:33.514 --> 02:47:36.395]  My children are with me the majority of the time.
[02:47:36.855 --> 02:47:41.757]  But the media lies so bad, they say I'm deeply racist, and then don't show where I'm racist.
[02:47:41.837 --> 02:47:53.622]  I mean, they just... And so it just makes me, endears me more to, like, Trump or an Arpaio, because I'm in the club where you... I mean, the media has reached new lows of lying, but you know what the good news is?
[02:47:55.214 --> 02:47:58.637]  Only weak-minded people believe it, and Democrat-run federal courts.
[02:47:58.717 --> 02:48:00.699]  It's scary to understand.
[02:48:00.739 --> 02:48:08.166]  I'm also in the club where they want to put us in jail now, and you know, you as a counselor, as an officer of the court, I know you've studied history.
[02:48:08.606 --> 02:48:11.589]  What is it like to see our political climate this dangerous?
[02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:18.736]  It is really scary, and it was scary to read this opinion, and it's scary to see what has gone on.
[02:48:19.753 --> 02:48:37.731]  With Sheriff Arpaio, because every citizen should be concerned about, whether a Democrat or a Republican, because what if this were a Republican, what if that was a Republican Department of Justice that initiated this and it was before Trump appointed judges?
[02:48:37.951 --> 02:48:43.397]  I wouldn't support throwing somebody in jail, because something like this, this is crazy.
[02:48:44.215 --> 02:48:44.435]  Right.
[02:48:44.896 --> 02:48:57.369]  It's an interference by the courts with the executive branch and the autonomy of the executive branch and the will of the people when they vote in people because this was done to defeat a candidate.
[02:48:57.729 --> 02:49:05.737]  That there is no... So for political purposes, plus how is it... how is a... we should probably spend a minute or two on what happened in the contempt.
[02:49:05.757 --> 02:49:07.038]  Why don't you tell folks about that?
[02:49:08.039 --> 02:49:08.639]  Well, I will.
[02:49:08.679 --> 02:49:11.361]  Let me just opine on one thing before I forget this.
[02:49:11.481 --> 02:49:13.502]  And just, Alex, think about this.
[02:49:14.162 --> 02:49:23.687]  Think about that a few months ago, the FBI said that they don't have time to monitor all potential terrorists in the United States.
[02:49:23.767 --> 02:49:25.488]  They don't have enough manpower.
[02:49:25.808 --> 02:49:31.571]  But they have enough manpower to pursue an 85-year-old retired sheriff.
[02:49:31.811 --> 02:49:32.392]  On a wet chart?
[02:49:33.795 --> 02:49:35.776]  And that's just really tragic.
[02:49:35.816 --> 02:49:48.822]  And again, regardless of your political affiliation, do we really want scarce prosecutorial and law enforcement resources wasting their time on something this... But look what they did to Tom DeLay.
[02:49:48.882 --> 02:49:49.803]  He didn't do anything wrong.
[02:49:50.883 --> 02:49:53.204]  He was later found not guilty.
[02:49:53.625 --> 02:49:57.586]  They constantly are on witch hunts trying to put people in prison.
[02:49:58.607 --> 02:50:00.528]  Right, because it's a lot safer
[02:50:01.570 --> 02:50:13.294]  For the FBI to go out and interview a bunch of people in connection with what Sheriff Arpaio might have said to them, and actually chase dangerous terrorists.
[02:50:13.734 --> 02:50:17.936]  And that's frankly what I think everybody in the country would like to see our FBI doing.
[02:50:17.956 --> 02:50:19.016]  Alright, stay right there.
[02:50:19.036 --> 02:50:20.757]  What about the separation of powers you raised?
[02:50:21.317 --> 02:50:23.998]  Because it's true the president doesn't have to answer questions of Congress.
[02:50:24.358 --> 02:50:28.259]  It's true a sheriff, if it's not a particular criminal case, he himself is being charged with.
[02:50:28.599 --> 02:50:30.379]  And the sheriff would say that's proprietary information.
[02:50:30.439 --> 02:50:32.300]  I'm not gonna, you know, give that out to this court.
[02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:34.720]  People don't understand the separation of powers in government.
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:40.762]  Now the judiciary has been trying to run over all of that selectively and it's a very dangerous situation.
[02:50:41.042 --> 02:50:41.602]  Don't forget!
[02:50:42.603 --> 02:50:43.444]  It ends today.
[02:50:43.824 --> 02:50:52.130]  Free shipping store-wide at InfowarsStore.com on t-shirts, on books, on films, on high-quality water filtration, and air purifiers.
[02:50:52.390 --> 02:50:58.554]  The best systems out there at the lowest prices, and all the supplements, like our amazing fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:50:59.055 --> 02:51:01.016]  All of it, massively discounted with free shipping.
[02:51:08.481 --> 02:51:10.343]  Hope the mainstream media feels powerful.
[02:51:11.650 --> 02:51:15.763]  When you know this is all going on and you do everything you can to lie about what this show broadcasts, what we cover.
[02:51:16.646 --> 02:51:17.569]  The blood of those children.
[02:51:18.689 --> 02:51:20.289]  All over the world held in captivity.
[02:51:20.629 --> 02:51:23.450]  UN caught kidnapping thousands out of Haiti alone.
[02:51:24.470 --> 02:51:25.850]  The blood is on your hands.
[02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:27.571]  Leo Zegami, let me ask you this question.
[02:51:28.151 --> 02:51:36.352]  Who is behind this global sudden wave of thousands of thousands of pedophiles per country being caught?
[02:51:36.852 --> 02:51:38.093]  10,000 plus arrests here.
[02:51:38.453 --> 02:51:44.874]  What is causing this massive move against pedophile rings that even MSM admits may bring down the Catholic Church?
[02:51:45.054 --> 02:51:52.597]  Well, it's happening, and it's happening clearly in front of the whole world with George Pell, but it's also an internal conflict.
[02:51:52.697 --> 02:52:11.884]  A few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican, we had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the Holy Office, the ex-Inquisition, now known as the Congregation for the Matters of Faith, basically the headquarters of the most holy office in the Vatican.
[02:52:12.124 --> 02:52:13.865]  The police broke in and found
[02:52:13.865 --> 02:52:26.688]  They found a gay orgy and they were using cocaine and they basically had to arrest the secretary of a very prominent cardinal who himself was waging war against Cardinal Pell.
[02:52:27.068 --> 02:52:29.068]  So there is also an internal war here.
[02:52:29.788 --> 02:52:43.231]  Cardinal Pell is responsible for many decades of secret plan devised by the Vatican to give the less possible money to the victims of pedophilia and manipulate them.
[02:52:43.491 --> 02:52:50.358]  And he was made a member of the C9 group, which is a group of nine cardinals.
[02:52:51.304 --> 02:52:59.391]  And three of these cardinals have been heavily criticized for having protected in the past pedophilia, including Cardinal Pell.
[02:52:59.771 --> 02:53:06.157]  So many people were actually astonished of seeing in February 2014 Cardinal Pell arriving in Rome.
[02:53:06.177 --> 02:53:13.763]  And he didn't really hide in front of the media or, you know, in front of the other people in the Vatican.
[02:53:13.783 --> 02:53:17.086]  He started immediately acting with a lavish lifestyle
[02:53:17.526 --> 02:53:31.451]  That of course brought a lot of criticism towards Pope Francis who wants to be this very conservative Pope who doesn't spend much money and is living in a modest surrounding.
[02:53:31.612 --> 02:53:40.535]  While instead George Pell was spending money, was making all kinds of things happening that were putting really in bad light Pope Francis.
[02:53:40.755 --> 02:53:44.137]  But he was not taking care of any of this criticism.
[02:53:44.337 --> 02:53:49.481]  He put him there and he basically became, after the Secretary of State, the number three in the Vatican.
[02:53:49.521 --> 02:54:00.428]  So this is the first time in history, Alex, that such a high-ranking officer, let's say, or minister of this Vatican is put in front of a trial.
[02:54:08.255 --> 02:54:11.436]  All right, final segment of the first three hours of global transmission.
[02:54:11.456 --> 02:54:13.177]  You know, the fourth hour is a grab bag.
[02:54:13.197 --> 02:54:24.420]  And that's why we got Roger Stone coming up to host the fourth hour to cover all the latest news, breaking information from inside the White House, what really happened with Scaramucci, but what is moving forward.
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:33.603]  That is all coming up with Roger Stone, who's being sued by Barack Obama's lawyers, claiming with no evidence that he's behind the Russian hacking.
[02:54:33.923 --> 02:54:35.544]  But we now have Cy Hirsch.
[02:54:37.625 --> 02:54:44.467]  Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner saying, from his national intelligence sources, the FBI was surveilling Seth Rich.
[02:54:45.288 --> 02:54:46.928]  And that it was Seth Rich leaked it.
[02:54:48.229 --> 02:54:49.409]  And that's what WikiLeaks has said, too.
[02:54:49.729 --> 02:54:50.790]  This is so big!
[02:54:51.930 --> 02:54:58.012]  Ladies and gentlemen, so I know Roger has a guest coming up in the second segment, but man, sometimes you want to punt on stuff.
[02:54:58.052 --> 02:54:59.973]  I'm sure it's a big guest, because this is big.
[02:55:00.013 --> 02:55:02.654]  I want to find out what Roger has to say about that.
[02:55:03.695 --> 02:55:07.837]  But this is quite a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen, quite a time.
[02:55:08.217 --> 02:55:09.557]  They are coming after everybody.
[02:55:09.577 --> 02:55:17.961]  That's why I'm not going to forget Arpaio now that he's retired, driven out by Bloomberg and Soros money, and they want to put him in prison on top of it to send a message.
[02:55:17.981 --> 02:55:19.021]  I hope they do this to me.
[02:55:19.061 --> 02:55:19.882]  People won't forget me.
[02:55:20.422 --> 02:55:22.943]  So in closing, what do we do to help on this?
[02:55:23.943 --> 02:55:26.144]  I'm talking to his lawyer right now.
[02:55:26.244 --> 02:55:27.965]  What do we do, sir, to counter
[02:55:30.350 --> 02:55:38.714]  All of this and expanding on that, Mark Goldman of gzlawoffice.com, professor as well.
[02:55:39.515 --> 02:55:44.417]  What do we need to know about this case of the separation of powers?
[02:55:45.758 --> 02:55:59.245]  Well, I think all of us need to let our representatives in Washington know that we don't like and we don't want
[02:56:00.100 --> 02:56:09.910]  A justice department or justice department officials interfering with elections, whether they're local, state or national elections.
[02:56:10.371 --> 02:56:13.734]  The Justice Department needs to stay out of those matters.
[02:56:14.635 --> 02:56:22.604]  Number one on a on the matter pertaining to Sheriff Arpaio himself, Sheriff Arpaio just
[02:56:24.073 --> 02:56:41.670]  Needs and wants everybody's support to know that people do support him that no one buys into this ruling that he's guilty because the sheriff is a very proud man and the sheriff has an enormous amount of integrity.
[02:56:41.910 --> 02:56:42.231]  He is
[02:56:44.016 --> 02:56:49.297]  Probably, if not the most honest, one of the most honest people I have ever met in my life.
[02:56:49.957 --> 02:56:53.118]  Sure, he's definitely an old-timer in that respect, and that's a good thing.
[02:56:53.478 --> 02:57:02.020]  Just briefly, folks, explain what happened with the so-called contempt he's... that the judge, Judge Jerry Executioner, that Judge Dredd has found him guilty of.
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:12.043]  Yeah, well now, he's... the judge in her ruling set a date in October for
[02:57:12.992 --> 02:57:13.953]  His sentencing.
[02:57:14.773 --> 02:57:15.934]  Why in October?
[02:57:16.094 --> 02:57:17.135]  We have no idea.
[02:57:17.155 --> 02:57:19.156]  We're going to ask her to move that up.
[02:57:19.616 --> 02:57:23.258]  The sheriff's 85 years old and he certainly wants some finality.
[02:57:23.318 --> 02:57:25.219]  Well, let me tell you, they're planning a coup against Trump.
[02:57:25.259 --> 02:57:25.880]  It's been announced.
[02:57:27.201 --> 02:57:27.901]  Well, yeah.
[02:57:28.261 --> 02:57:31.643]  You know, this just will not end.
[02:57:31.743 --> 02:57:34.185]  They're not... They don't want to leave him alone.
[02:57:34.665 --> 02:57:37.407]  They want to... That sounds insane.
[02:57:37.527 --> 02:57:40.989]  Brennan said they're going to have a coup on TV last week.
[02:57:42.372 --> 02:57:44.094]  Oh yeah.
[02:57:44.874 --> 02:57:54.122]  If that type of rhetoric had been used against any other president, and especially Barack Obama, there would be rioting in the street.
[02:57:54.582 --> 02:58:04.991]  But somehow, the people who don't like Trump feel that they are entitled to essentially overthrow the government of the United States.
[02:58:06.292 --> 02:58:06.893]  It's shocking.
[02:58:08.706 --> 02:58:09.366]  It's incredible.
[02:58:09.487 --> 02:58:11.728]  I mean, specifically though, we only got 45 seconds.
[02:58:11.748 --> 02:58:13.169]  Tell them how they found him in contempt.
[02:58:14.309 --> 02:58:16.030]  Oh, she found him in contempt.
[02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:17.331]  There are three elements.
[02:58:17.531 --> 02:58:19.413]  The order must be clear and definite.
[02:58:19.993 --> 02:58:24.476]  The defendant must have notice and understanding of the order.
[02:58:25.136 --> 02:58:27.337]  And he must willfully disobey it.
[02:58:28.218 --> 02:58:29.979]  What was he disobeying, supposedly?
[02:58:31.686 --> 02:58:39.654]  A preliminary injunction order by a judge in another court, which was anything but clear and definite, that was never proved in the case.
[02:58:39.694 --> 02:58:40.375]  Sure, absolutely.
[02:58:40.395 --> 02:58:42.598]  So he said, I'm going to do my job and arrest illegals.
[02:58:42.978 --> 02:58:44.359]  So they're trying to put him in prison.
[02:58:45.020 --> 02:58:45.801]  It's incredible.
[02:58:45.881 --> 02:58:46.121]  All right.
[02:58:46.161 --> 02:58:48.444]  Thank you so much, Mark, for that.
[02:58:48.484 --> 02:58:49.985]  We'll be right back with the 4th Hour.
[02:58:50.025 --> 02:58:50.746]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:50.766 --> 02:58:51.267]  Spread the word.
[02:58:53.700 --> 02:58:58.086]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:58:58.186 --> 02:59:09.121]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:59:09.281 --> 02:59:14.203]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:59:14.323 --> 02:59:16.843]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:59:16.903 --> 02:59:18.384]  It helps detoxify.
[02:59:18.404 --> 02:59:21.445]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:59:21.505 --> 02:59:26.247]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:59:26.267 --> 02:59:30.388]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[02:59:30.828 --> 02:59:37.830]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:59:37.950 --> 02:59:39.391]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:59:39.571 --> 02:59:40.311]  This is so key.
[02:59:40.551 --> 02:59:44.852]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:59:44.872 --> 02:59:46.973]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:59:47.093 --> 02:59:50.554]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:56.061 --> 03:00:00.172]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:00:00.693 --> 03:00:01.997]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:16.903 --> 03:00:17.644]  Big Brother.
[03:00:18.044 --> 03:00:19.265]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:19.825 --> 03:00:20.806]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:21.767 --> 03:00:23.168]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:23.428 --> 03:00:24.649]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:25.089 --> 03:00:29.613]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.775 --> 03:00:44.304]  As I have said thousands of times, if you debate the censors, the all-high appointed leftist witch-hunt commandants,
[03:00:46.232 --> 03:00:52.158]  ...and Capitanos, and say, I'm not racist, don't censor me, they've already won.
[03:00:52.559 --> 03:00:54.601]  They're not supposed to be in the position of censoring.
[03:00:55.742 --> 03:00:56.943]  We're in Western society.
[03:00:57.364 --> 03:01:01.088]  Unless you're calling for violence against somebody, you have free speech.
[03:01:02.569 --> 03:01:06.514]  But they're the ones calling for violence, but notice they're saying, we don't have free speech.
[03:01:08.151 --> 03:01:10.933]  And they always turn it around to, like, oh, you hate people.
[03:01:11.554 --> 03:01:13.876]  I don't hate men that think they're women or vice versa.
[03:01:13.936 --> 03:01:15.437]  And if people want to do that, that's their issue.
[03:01:15.477 --> 03:01:16.218]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:01:18.579 --> 03:01:20.921]  I don't want to pay for your sex change via taxes.
[03:01:21.402 --> 03:01:23.684]  I don't want to pay to have your wisdom teeth removed.
[03:01:24.564 --> 03:01:28.027]  I don't want to pay for you to have... What is it where they suck the fat out?
[03:01:28.387 --> 03:01:29.168]  Liposuction.
[03:01:29.849 --> 03:01:30.369]  Duh!
[03:01:30.969 --> 03:01:33.531]  But they got the headlines, Jones is a homophobe.
[03:01:34.112 --> 03:01:37.435]  Why, right here, he said that a man that had a baby wasn't a man.
[03:01:38.837 --> 03:01:42.498]  Because it said it was a woman that thought she was a man that then got pregnant!
[03:01:42.738 --> 03:01:43.698]  She's a woman!
[03:01:46.319 --> 03:01:52.100]  You don't put a blue bow on a whale that's a male and say it's a female.
[03:01:52.940 --> 03:01:55.481]  You don't look at a male walrus and say it's a female.
[03:01:56.981 --> 03:01:57.681]  Or vice versa.
[03:01:57.701 --> 03:01:59.722]  You don't have a female walrus saying she's a male.
[03:01:59.822 --> 03:02:01.102]  I mean, this is mental illness.
[03:02:01.142 --> 03:02:03.523]  But then they sit there and look at it and they say, no, you're crazy.
[03:02:03.763 --> 03:02:05.163]  Look how crazy Jones is.
[03:02:05.883 --> 03:02:07.944]  He said this woman that thought she was a
[03:02:09.272 --> 03:02:14.813]  Man had a baby, but they said this man did have a baby.
[03:02:17.714 --> 03:02:20.535]  This man was a woman that identifies as a man.
[03:02:20.775 --> 03:02:21.855]  It's like magic talk.
[03:02:22.235 --> 03:02:25.076]  I'm a 20-foot giraffe with purple spots!
[03:02:25.956 --> 03:02:29.797]  And when I go to the bathroom, Lucky Charms comes out golden rainbows.
[03:02:32.558 --> 03:02:37.799]  I'm a 50-foot red-purple striped giraffe and
[03:02:39.172 --> 03:02:42.253]  When I go to the bathroom, I give birth to leprechauns.
[03:02:43.314 --> 03:02:47.395]  And if you don't agree to that, you're insane, you're crazy, because I control things, I'm magical.
[03:02:48.696 --> 03:02:50.476]  And I told you this was going further.
[03:02:50.916 --> 03:02:53.657]  Look at this story up on InfoWars.com, Daily Caller.
[03:02:54.018 --> 03:03:02.761]  It links through to the Toronto newspapers and others that with straight faces report this like it's a good thing.
[03:03:02.881 --> 03:03:05.662]  All over the world there's biology professors, a lot of them are liberals.
[03:03:06.362 --> 03:03:08.323]  And they're going, no, I'm not going to call a man a woman.
[03:03:09.153 --> 03:03:10.813]  No, I'm not going to say a woman's a man.
[03:03:10.933 --> 03:03:11.133]  No.
[03:03:11.633 --> 03:03:11.834]  No.
[03:03:12.314 --> 03:03:12.534]  No.
[03:03:13.694 --> 03:03:18.035]  If someone wants to body modify and they want to mentally say that's them, that's one thing.
[03:03:18.915 --> 03:03:24.556]  Just like if I want to claim I'm a dog, and there are people that do that, we're just not going to pay to take care of you.
[03:03:25.876 --> 03:03:32.897]  And the other thing, when you blind yourself and the government pays for you to identify as a blind person, that's called sabotaging civilization.
[03:03:32.957 --> 03:03:34.278]  That's why it's being funded.
[03:03:34.558 --> 03:03:36.258]  That's been declassified!
[03:03:38.453 --> 03:03:46.336]  In the family, in independence, in people being motivated, introduce these systems that disturb things.
[03:03:47.617 --> 03:03:50.058]  You don't identify as a blind person, you're a mental patient.
[03:03:51.078 --> 03:03:51.459]  Update!
[03:03:51.599 --> 03:03:57.581]  Google and YouTube ban professor who refused to use gender neutral pronouns.
[03:03:57.661 --> 03:03:58.882]  You gotta say G and Z.
[03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:04.342]  A Canadian professor refused to use gender-neutral pronouns and criticized social justice issues.
[03:04:04.682 --> 03:04:12.867]  A professor in Canada refused to use gender-neutral pronouns and criticized social justice images, has been banned from using his Google and YouTube accounts.
[03:04:14.148 --> 03:04:20.371]  Professor Jordan B. Peterson of the University of Toronto disputed Google and YouTube's decision to lock him out of his accounts.
[03:04:21.252 --> 03:04:23.153]  Please tell me what principle I violated.
[03:04:24.665 --> 03:04:28.746]  Said Peterson in the email to Google, upon discovering he was locked out of his account.
[03:04:29.366 --> 03:04:36.568]  The psychology professor has over 300,000 subscribers on the YouTube channel, which he uses as a platform to post his lectures, interviews, and Q&A.
[03:04:37.589 --> 03:04:45.051]  And they got all these psychologists, biologists, and others who are being run out of campuses.
[03:04:46.451 --> 03:04:51.933]  Because they look at you and they go, listen, you're not a man when you've got a uterus.
[03:04:53.283 --> 03:04:54.244]  Then you can have a baby.
[03:04:54.324 --> 03:04:59.751]  It's okay for you to want to say you're a man, but we're not gonna sit here and agree with you because you're mentally ill.
[03:05:00.612 --> 03:05:01.313]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:03.533 --> 03:05:12.757]  Ruthless offshore elites use their corporate liberal media to attack and demonize any Americans or any independent news that dare challenge their lives.
[03:05:13.357 --> 03:05:16.539]  Five companies own over 90% of the media.
[03:05:16.959 --> 03:05:23.442]  And that's why, whether it's comedy shows, award shows, Hollywood, TV entertainment, the news, it doesn't matter.
[03:05:23.762 --> 03:05:31.786]  It's all focused in one anti-American, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-gun voice.
[03:05:32.586 --> 03:05:33.327]  And it gets worse.
[03:05:33.687 --> 03:05:44.800]  These ruthless social engineers have an iron grip on our educational system and are teaching our children to hate America and that our president is worse than Hitler and needs to be assassinated.
[03:05:45.261 --> 03:05:52.329]  But as America reawakens, these powerful, deep state, rogue government forces are beginning to panic.
[03:05:52.990 --> 03:06:05.335]  They've even got the former president on television and in the news, and traveling to foreign countries, bad-mouthing America, bad-mouthing sovereignty, and calling for a resistance to our elected president.
[03:06:05.835 --> 03:06:17.740]  In a last-ditch effort, mainstream media is now legitimizing the use of violence against anyone that opposes the globalist takeover, and against anyone who's actually trying to make this nation great again.
[03:06:18.280 --> 03:06:30.585]  They are absolutely intensifying their efforts, screaming homophobe, xenophobe, racist, to make them march, to make them go out on the streets and assault viciously anyone trying to exercise their free speech.
[03:06:31.105 --> 03:06:38.908]  International criminals like George Soros are openly pushing for civil insurrection in America that will lead to civil war.
[03:06:39.548 --> 03:06:46.354]  The beatings, the stabbings, the shootings, the burning cars, the looting of shops, the execution of police officers.
[03:06:46.975 --> 03:06:57.204]  All of this leads to the destabilization, to the martial law that the deep state and the globalists say they need to bring in their final takeover of America.
[03:06:57.905 --> 03:07:02.109]  We are America, and we are the Infowar.
[03:07:03.914 --> 03:07:05.255]  Why is the fungus?
[03:07:05.335 --> 03:07:06.276]  Why is the mold?
[03:07:06.416 --> 03:07:07.857]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[03:07:08.157 --> 03:07:08.977]  What is going on?
[03:07:09.118 --> 03:07:09.878]  What has changed?
[03:07:34.174 --> 03:07:35.575]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[03:07:35.595 --> 03:07:37.577]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[03:07:37.597 --> 03:07:38.458]  For me, it's been incredible.
[03:07:39.058 --> 03:07:43.381]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[03:07:43.582 --> 03:07:44.282]  Get it today.
[03:07:44.302 --> 03:07:44.863]  Limited run.
[03:07:44.883 --> 03:07:45.903]  It'll be months till we get more.
[03:07:46.304 --> 03:07:50.467]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:07:50.967 --> 03:07:54.250]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[03:07:54.310 --> 03:07:56.612]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[03:07:56.632 --> 03:07:58.073]  Look at the response we're getting.
[03:07:58.433 --> 03:07:59.934]  We're changing the world together.
[03:07:59.994 --> 03:08:00.975]  You are the Infowar.
[03:08:00.995 --> 03:08:01.736]  God bless you all.
[03:08:08.841 --> 03:08:10.101]  That's right, folks.
[03:08:10.202 --> 03:08:18.848]  It's Roger Stone coming up.
[03:08:19.969 --> 03:08:21.150]  Big Alabama race.
[03:08:21.210 --> 03:08:21.771]  How many?
[03:08:39.882 --> 03:08:43.245]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[03:08:45.328 --> 03:08:48.371]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[03:08:48.471 --> 03:08:58.222]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny of the mind.
[03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:03.561]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:09:03.861 --> 03:09:10.203]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:13.604 --> 03:09:24.388]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the Obama White House set up a law firm to sue patriots and to stop the Trump Revolution while they've sued the President and Roger Stone.
[03:09:24.888 --> 03:09:31.090]  He's got very exciting updates on that front with their whole fake legal case with literally no proof saying he hacked
[03:09:31.883 --> 03:09:34.824]  The DNC gave the information to WikiLeaks.
[03:09:35.364 --> 03:09:36.324]  Totally insane.
[03:09:36.824 --> 03:09:41.006]  We have two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Cy Hirsch coming out.
[03:09:41.046 --> 03:09:42.806]  The story is on Infowars.com.
[03:09:43.286 --> 03:09:52.929]  Media completely ignores bombshell Seymour Hirsch revelations on Seth Rich identifying him according to Cy Hirsch's FBI, NSA sources.
[03:09:53.609 --> 03:09:56.210]  High level that he's had for a decade.
[03:09:57.874 --> 03:10:00.736]  Ladies and gentlemen, it was Seth Rich.
[03:10:01.117 --> 03:10:03.519]  He's been in contact, not just with the FBI, but with...
[03:10:04.636 --> 03:10:05.337]  Julian Assange.
[03:10:05.357 --> 03:10:09.060]  Well, Julian Assange already told us when Seth Rich got killed back in July.
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:11.402]  He said, look, he was our source.
[03:10:11.462 --> 03:10:12.583]  We can't officially say it.
[03:10:12.843 --> 03:10:16.166]  We never give out sources, but you can believe it should be investigated.
[03:10:16.947 --> 03:10:18.248]  So we have Julian Assange.
[03:10:18.268 --> 03:10:19.149]  We have Cy Hirsch.
[03:10:19.609 --> 03:10:21.751]  We have just absolute evidence.
[03:10:21.831 --> 03:10:27.276]  And that's why they're so scared and why they don't want any discussion of the Seth Rich murder.
[03:10:27.496 --> 03:10:29.298]  They act like the guy never existed now.
[03:10:29.778 --> 03:10:38.004]  Now we've got exciting races against Democrats around the country and against neocons, and Roger showed us a special guest that he's about to bring up right now.
[03:10:38.024 --> 03:10:40.485]  We're going to skip the next break so Roger gets this time back.
[03:10:40.525 --> 03:10:44.368]  But, Roger, I know you're going to break this down after your next guest leaves us.
[03:10:44.488 --> 03:10:45.429]  This is amazing.
[03:10:47.958 --> 03:11:16.927]  Alex, I mean, Seymour Hersh, New York Times, Pulitzer Prize winner, one of the most respected investigative reporters in the country, now reveals to us that not only was Seth Rich the most likely source of the WikiLeaks documents, last week William Binney and others came forward to say that they have technical evidence that most of the material from the Democratic National Committee was not hacked at all, but downloaded, loaded to thumb drives,
[03:11:17.467 --> 03:11:36.038]  Spirited out of the building by rich most likely sold by the way But we also know that that a British diplomat Came forward and claimed that he was essentially the mule that took those things to Julian Assange so the entire Russian hacking
[03:11:36.918 --> 03:11:44.405]  Meme or narrative as put together by John Podesta and the Democrats is collapsing before your very eyes.
[03:11:44.585 --> 03:11:50.811]  And then, of course, you have the relationship of the Awan brothers and where they fit into this.
[03:11:50.871 --> 03:11:55.316]  We're going to be getting into all of that and more right here at Info Wars.
[03:11:57.150 --> 03:12:13.102]  I do want to point out that one of the opportunities, in my opinion, through the failure of the healthcare effort last week, is that President Trump may now realize that the establishment Republicans are not really for him.
[03:12:13.963 --> 03:12:17.586]  And that voters could really make a difference.
[03:12:17.646 --> 03:12:35.760]  The President has a unique opportunity to thwart the Republican establishment and go into these states and districts, take on incumbent Republicans who are not with the program, not only clean up the Republican Party, return it to being a party of nationalism and the middle class, but also
[03:12:36.741 --> 03:12:37.202]  Thank you.
[03:12:48.007 --> 03:12:56.670]  Mike, pardon me, Colonel Mike McAllister of my home state of Florida, decorated war hero, but more importantly, the spokesman for Citizens for Trump.
[03:12:57.190 --> 03:13:05.253]  Now, Citizens for Trump is the grassroots organization from where Mike Cernovich, Jack Sobiak and others come from.
[03:13:05.373 --> 03:13:08.535]  This is the, these are the marching troops.
[03:13:08.615 --> 03:13:11.816]  These are the front lines of the Trump revolution.
[03:13:13.056 --> 03:13:14.737]  Colonel McAllister, thanks for joining us.
[03:13:15.797 --> 03:13:17.538]  Hey, it's great to be on today, Roger.
[03:13:18.753 --> 03:13:29.142]  You made a trip recently to Alabama, and I want to talk about that because this is a classic case of where fear could be struck in the hearts of the Republican establishment.
[03:13:30.183 --> 03:13:31.284]  The appointed U.S.
[03:13:31.324 --> 03:13:36.629]  Senator Luther Strange, a former Attorney General, has the support of Mitch McConnell,
[03:13:37.289 --> 03:13:38.670]  And the Republican establishment.
[03:13:39.130 --> 03:13:41.571]  He is awash in special interest money.
[03:13:42.111 --> 03:13:58.058]  They have managed to postpone several inquiries into unethical activity, including taking a bribe to look the other way on a major environmental issue in his state, using Attorney General campaign money for the U.S.
[03:13:58.098 --> 03:13:58.659]  Senate race.
[03:13:58.899 --> 03:14:01.840]  We're going to postpone that all till after the election, folks.
[03:14:01.860 --> 03:14:06.122]  So, Colonel, tell us why you went to Alabama and tell us the situation.
[03:14:07.349 --> 03:14:08.870]  Well, I was up there last week.
[03:14:08.930 --> 03:14:13.054]  In fact, I communicate with the campaign again today.
[03:14:13.074 --> 03:14:17.638]  I was up there, I guess, two weeks ago for most of the week.
[03:14:18.319 --> 03:14:20.901]  And obviously what we have is a special election.
[03:14:21.361 --> 03:14:27.627]  It's the primary to replace the seat that was held by the new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.
[03:14:28.374 --> 03:14:32.476]  And it is going to be a critical decision for Alabama.
[03:14:32.976 --> 03:14:33.517]  And you're right.
[03:14:33.557 --> 03:14:38.999]  He's running against an appointed incumbent named Luther Strange.
[03:14:39.680 --> 03:14:43.502]  And Luther was the former AG who was investigating the governor.
[03:14:43.942 --> 03:14:47.804]  And then the governor appointed him to take the vacant Senate seat.
[03:14:48.706 --> 03:14:55.732]  So, they now are having this special election, but there's a lot going on there, a lot on the ground, just like you touched on.
[03:14:55.772 --> 03:14:57.954]  You also have Bo Brooks, who's a sitting U.S.
[03:14:58.014 --> 03:14:59.576]  Congressman, and he's in that race.
[03:15:00.116 --> 03:15:02.238]  Never Trumper.
[03:15:02.278 --> 03:15:03.139]  Never Trumper.
[03:15:03.639 --> 03:15:08.944]  And you have a former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Ray Moore, who's in that race.
[03:15:09.790 --> 03:15:21.525]  And then you have Dr. Randy Brinson, who's really the true outsider and conservative and is pro-Trump and wants to help the president achieve his agenda to make America great again.
[03:15:21.986 --> 03:15:25.591]  And he's also a physician and a lay minister.
[03:15:26.875 --> 03:15:28.316]  And I want to make one thing very clear.
[03:15:28.336 --> 03:15:38.165]  No one here at InfoWars, not Roger Stone, not Colonel McAllister, no one at InfoWars has any financial or consulting or business relationship.
[03:15:38.765 --> 03:15:41.888]  I'm supporting Randy Brinson because he supported Donald Trump.
[03:15:42.408 --> 03:15:49.731]  Because he was with Trump early, and because I want to strike fear in the heart of Mitch McConnell.
[03:15:50.532 --> 03:15:59.796]  These establishment Republicans, these rhinos, must know that you can't cross Donald Trump with impunity, that there is some consequence.
[03:16:00.316 --> 03:16:06.324]  Now, Colonel McAllister, I know a lot of my friends here in Florida would like to see you run for public office.
[03:16:06.444 --> 03:16:08.867]  I know you looked at the, I guess, the U.S.
[03:16:08.907 --> 03:16:15.134]  Senate, and then when Senator Marco Rubio reversed himself, decided not to retire, he pulled back.
[03:16:15.275 --> 03:16:17.658]  But what's on your horizon?
[03:16:18.854 --> 03:16:23.416]  Well, actually, I ran in the Senate primary and lost to Connie Mack, and then he lost to Bill Nelson.
[03:16:23.756 --> 03:16:24.136]  Excellent.
[03:16:24.216 --> 03:16:30.959]  But, you know, right now what we're doing is we're trying to reach out and support pro-Trump candidates.
[03:16:31.339 --> 03:16:34.921]  You know, I am the national spokesman for Citizens for Trump.
[03:16:35.421 --> 03:16:38.642]  We're involved in this Senate race in Alabama.
[03:16:38.662 --> 03:16:42.524]  We're going to be looking at some governor races, maybe key congressional races.
[03:16:43.075 --> 03:16:44.376]  So right now, I'm focused on that.
[03:16:44.496 --> 03:16:45.937]  But I will say this, Roger.
[03:16:46.057 --> 03:16:48.499]  You know, having run for governor, I lost to Rick Scott.
[03:16:48.659 --> 03:16:49.520]  Having run for U.S.
[03:16:49.660 --> 03:16:59.187]  Senate, I am always open, though, and willing to step up anytime I have a chance to serve this great state of Florida and this great nation.
[03:16:59.287 --> 03:17:01.789]  So I'm keeping all those options open.
[03:17:02.310 --> 03:17:10.676]  Right now, we're focused on trying to get people in office that can support the president and help him move America forward and get the swamp right.
[03:17:11.974 --> 03:17:17.659]  Well, as you know, Abraham Lincoln lost a House race and a Senate race back-to-back before going to the White House.
[03:17:18.159 --> 03:17:20.241]  So I'm delighted to hear that you're not encouraged.
[03:17:20.281 --> 03:17:27.988]  We need good men and women like you who are not globalists, who are not afraid of the Republican establishment.
[03:17:28.548 --> 03:17:37.336]  Owen Shoyer here at Infowars helped us identify Omar Navarro, who I think is one of the most promising young reform candidates out there.
[03:17:38.156 --> 03:18:04.161]  And one of the things I want to do here at InfoWars is to spotlight patriots who are running, patriots who are down with the Trump reform agenda, patriots who are unafraid to call out Islamic terrorism when they see it, patriots who will stand up for a strong national defense, but to turn away from this neocon foreign policy of going around the globe looking for trouble.
[03:18:04.781 --> 03:18:10.043]  Now, are there any other races that you want to mention here before we move on?
[03:18:10.103 --> 03:18:13.144]  Because it's such a fast, news-breaking day.
[03:18:13.164 --> 03:18:18.045]  You've got developments on the Awan brothers and the Seth Rich murder.
[03:18:18.805 --> 03:18:23.587]  You have an analysis coming up of the new Trump White House and what's going on there.
[03:18:23.707 --> 03:18:27.008]  So, Colonel McAllister, you've got the floor here for a minute.
[03:18:27.388 --> 03:18:29.709]  Tell us what else you see on the horizon.
[03:18:30.677 --> 03:18:36.442]  Well, I think that 2018, and I think you would agree, Roger, is going to be a pivotal year.
[03:18:37.163 --> 03:18:45.991]  And the Democrats are obviously looking at how to rebound and how to regain a base and use it as a launch pad for 2020.
[03:18:47.449 --> 03:18:57.797]  And living right here in Florida, like you and I both do, it's the biggest swing state in the nation, has 29 electoral votes, and we have a full plate of elections in 2018.
[03:18:58.338 --> 03:18:59.599]  We have the U.S.
[03:18:59.639 --> 03:19:03.321]  Senate race to replace Bill Nelson, which is going to be a high priority.
[03:19:03.942 --> 03:19:04.883]  All 27 of U.S.
[03:19:05.643 --> 03:19:08.365]  Congress races will again be up for re-election.
[03:19:08.786 --> 03:19:14.770]  But we're also going to have a governor and the entire governor's cabinet in Florida will be up for re-election in 2018.
[03:19:16.147 --> 03:19:30.610]  So I'm pretty sure the Democrats are aware of that and they're probably looking at if we could seize momentum in a key swing state like Florida, it could give us a launch pad for 2020 to try to take the White House back.
[03:19:30.670 --> 03:19:44.453]  So I look for them to have a big effort and a big emphasis and focus on Florida in 2018 to keep Bill Nelson in office and to regain the governor's mansion and use those as a launch pad to regain the White House in 2020.
[03:19:46.516 --> 03:19:47.756]  Well, well said.
[03:19:48.016 --> 03:19:52.157]  You know, folks, if you're not a member of Citizens for Trump, go online and sign up.
[03:19:52.217 --> 03:19:57.379]  This is one of the greatest, most vibrant, most robust grassroots organizations.
[03:19:57.419 --> 03:20:03.260]  Doesn't cost you anything to join, but they will tell you where the hot spots are in the country.
[03:20:03.320 --> 03:20:07.901]  This is where my friends Mike Cernovich and Jack Sobiak came from.
[03:20:08.481 --> 03:20:11.762]  This is the wellspring of those who couldn't get
[03:20:12.222 --> 03:20:15.024]  A response from the Trump campaign.
[03:20:15.084 --> 03:20:18.786]  So they went out and they built their own grassroots organization.
[03:20:19.746 --> 03:20:22.047]  And it is a great group, folks.
[03:20:22.107 --> 03:20:24.449]  I'm going to be speaking to them on the 12th in Atlanta.
[03:20:25.089 --> 03:20:28.431]  If you're not a member, I urge you to sign up and follow their activities.
[03:20:29.371 --> 03:20:32.113]  We are fully supportive here of Citizens for Trump.
[03:20:34.214 --> 03:20:35.575]  Colonel, thank you for joining us.
[03:20:35.915 --> 03:20:37.396]  And God bless America.
[03:20:37.696 --> 03:20:39.777]  And thank you for your service to our country.
[03:20:40.936 --> 03:20:42.257]  Thanks for having me on, Roger.
[03:20:42.337 --> 03:20:45.578]  I'd be pleased to be back with your program anytime.
[03:20:46.139 --> 03:20:47.039]  Many, many thanks.
[03:20:48.380 --> 03:20:55.263]  Let us move on now because I've never seen a news cycle like this where there's so much breaking.
[03:20:55.343 --> 03:20:59.725]  It's impossible for us here at InfoWars to keep up with the developments.
[03:20:59.805 --> 03:21:07.469]  As Alex Jones said in the opening, the media seems to have completely elevated this phony story about Donald Trump.
[03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:37.489]  Uh, you know, trying to manage fallout from the bogus story about his son's meeting with a Russian lawyer, uh, who seems to have been let into the country by the FBI despite any, uh, presence of a visa, uh, and who now has been tied directly to Fusion GPS, uh, and, uh, photos of her that we've obtained here at InfoWars at Hillary Clinton, uh, demonstrations, photos of the woman lawyer in Senator John McCain's office,
[03:21:38.309 --> 03:21:42.373]  The words setup look pretty apparent to me.
[03:21:42.553 --> 03:21:44.875]  This smells more and more like a setup.
[03:21:45.435 --> 03:21:47.337]  But let's be absolutely clear.
[03:21:47.997 --> 03:21:52.401]  There's nothing illegal nor improper with Donald Trump Jr.
[03:21:52.561 --> 03:22:01.249]  or the leadership of the Trump campaign meeting with a person who comes forward to claims that they have documented evidence of wrongdoing.
[03:22:01.869 --> 03:22:03.330]  No evidence existed.
[03:22:04.091 --> 03:22:16.239]  I was on a panel at Politicon with Jill Weinvolner, the former Watergate special prosecutor, a very learned and attractive and I would say articulate woman.
[03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:27.066]  But her claim that there was a campaign violation, that there was something of value was given to Trump Jr.
[03:22:27.407 --> 03:22:30.749]  and therefore there was a violation of the law is a bogus argument.
[03:22:31.329 --> 03:22:33.451]  Nothing whatsoever was given.
[03:22:34.131 --> 03:22:34.992]  Donald Trump Jr.
[03:22:35.032 --> 03:22:37.575]  was targeted because he's a follower of InfoWars.
[03:22:38.336 --> 03:22:39.397]  Donald Trump Jr.
[03:22:39.637 --> 03:22:47.485]  is one who often retweets some of the better stories here, produced by Alex Jones and the crew at InfoWars.
[03:22:47.946 --> 03:22:48.887]  He's a patriot.
[03:22:49.367 --> 03:22:52.590]  He's not afraid to support and defend his father.
[03:22:53.191 --> 03:23:00.093]  And that's why they have targeted him, not because he has done anything whatsoever that is improper.
[03:23:00.494 --> 03:23:02.374]  But they elevate that story.
[03:23:02.534 --> 03:23:19.761]  At the same time, we choose to ignore Pulitzer Prize-winning author Seymour Hersh, formerly of the New York Times, where he won a Pulitzer for the Maile story of Vietnam, which related, of course, to murders by the U.S.
[03:23:19.941 --> 03:23:20.481]  military.
[03:23:21.601 --> 03:23:41.478]  He believes, Hirsch this is, that not only was Rich's murder not a robbery gone wrong, but that Rich was the source for WikiLeaks, that he was loading material to a Dropbox where WikiLeaks and perhaps others
[03:23:42.339 --> 03:23:43.420]  Got access.
[03:23:44.380 --> 03:23:58.848]  Additionally, he says that along with William Binney and others there is now extraordinary evidence that there was minimal, perhaps no hacking whatsoever of the DNC.
[03:23:59.648 --> 03:24:13.771]  That the data was mostly downloaded to a thumb drive and passed on through intermediaries or put up on a Dropbox where WikiLeaks was able to obtain it.
[03:24:14.371 --> 03:24:24.393]  Now, as you know, Julian Assange, within the keeping of most journalists I know, is not in a position to disclose his sources.
[03:24:25.473 --> 03:24:37.582]  But when he offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the murder of Seth Rich, to me that was a pretty clear indicator that Rich was, in fact, one of his sources.
[03:24:38.223 --> 03:24:48.690]  Additionally, you'll notice that WikiLeaks often relinks other third-party stories that say that Rich was the source.
[03:24:49.491 --> 03:24:52.033]  Julian Assange is a very clever man.
[03:24:52.654 --> 03:24:53.455]  He's a journalist.
[03:24:53.815 --> 03:24:57.058]  And no, folks, he does not work for the Russians.
[03:24:57.799 --> 03:25:12.953]  The question of Rich's murder, well, it is believed by Hirsch that John Brennan, the Islamist convert who served as CIA director under Barack Obama and George W. Bush,
[03:25:13.573 --> 03:25:20.279]  Was behind this entire operation, both the operation to steal the data and blame it on Russia.
[03:25:20.759 --> 03:25:25.643]  We also know that there is an enormous mixing of apples and oranges.
[03:25:26.284 --> 03:25:33.831]  As far as the emails from the DNC is concerned, there is no evidence that that information was hacked and stolen.
[03:25:34.791 --> 03:25:48.718]  What was put online by Guccifer 2.0, who may not even be a Romanian, never mind a Russian, because his software actually traces to an individual who worked at the DNC.
[03:25:49.338 --> 03:25:54.101]  And what he uncovered was Donald Trump opposition research.
[03:25:54.961 --> 03:26:19.114]  So, in other words, he gave WikiLeaks, or someone gave WikiLeaks, negative information about Donald Trump, but the taggings, the markings of that, which are indisputable, don't track back to a Guccifer 2.0, they track back to a fellow named Wofford, I believe it is, who worked at the Democratic National Committee.
[03:26:22.762 --> 03:26:24.883]  The thick platens, as they say.
[03:26:26.183 --> 03:26:28.824]  And now you have the question of the Awan brothers.
[03:26:29.664 --> 03:26:30.765]  What to make of this?
[03:26:31.625 --> 03:26:33.026]  You've read about the Awan brothers.
[03:26:33.066 --> 03:26:38.828]  These are the two Pakistanis who came first to work for Deborah Wasserman Schultz.
[03:26:39.767 --> 03:26:56.236]  Every man's first wife and the former head of the Democratic National Committee who was forced to resign when it was revealed that she and Hillary had cheated poor Bernie Sanders in order to win the Democratic nomination.
[03:26:56.316 --> 03:26:56.797]  By the way,
[03:26:57.617 --> 03:27:03.882]  Primary votes in California between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders still not counted.
[03:27:04.122 --> 03:27:05.483]  The count goes on.
[03:27:05.964 --> 03:27:07.965]  Unbelievably, Donald Trump is president.
[03:27:08.265 --> 03:27:16.392]  The election has been over six months, but officials in the California Democratic Party can't count all the primary ballots out there in the Golden State.
[03:27:16.412 --> 03:27:16.932]  You know why?
[03:27:17.833 --> 03:27:20.255]  Because Hillary Clinton lost, that's why.
[03:27:20.715 --> 03:27:25.098]  And because the shift of those delegates would move the nomination to Bernie Sanders.
[03:27:25.658 --> 03:27:28.580]  So, that's why you have a cover-up going on there.
[03:27:29.921 --> 03:27:35.805]  I would say that the Awan brother problems for Debra Wasserman Schultz are just beginning.
[03:27:36.725 --> 03:27:46.992]  The two brothers worked for over 30 individual members of Congress, performing sensitive IT tasks that gave them access to top-secret and classified information.
[03:27:48.001 --> 03:27:57.845]  The extensive list of financial and legal red flags would have prohibited any person from being denied a security clearance, but Deborah Wasserman Schultz did the unthinkable.
[03:27:58.606 --> 03:28:07.830]  When the Capitol Hill police made it clear to her that they had launched an investigation over theft from the computer system of the U.S.
[03:28:08.210 --> 03:28:09.451]  House of Representatives,
[03:28:10.444 --> 03:28:18.888]  Wasserman Schultz actually changed the classification of the Awan brothers from consultants to employees.
[03:28:19.949 --> 03:28:30.674]  That way he and she ensured that they would continue to have access to the House of Representative computers despite the fact that they were under investigation.
[03:28:31.727 --> 03:28:36.330]  I think that that is in itself collusion with a couple of felons.
[03:28:37.130 --> 03:28:38.351]  The assistant U.S.
[03:28:38.411 --> 03:28:44.195]  attorney who's overseeing the Awan family investigation is Stephen Wasserman.
[03:28:44.315 --> 03:28:45.075]  Sound familiar?
[03:28:45.696 --> 03:28:50.539]  Why, he's the brother of Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz.
[03:28:52.236 --> 03:29:03.398]  It also appears that the Awan hard drives that were given to almost 20 pieces of equipment were turned over to the Capitol Hill police and the FBI were damaged and in some cases not intact.
[03:29:03.858 --> 03:29:18.461]  So the idea that they are being blackmailed, and that is why no Democratic national congressional member will come forward to testify, smells like blackmail to me.
[03:29:19.261 --> 03:29:24.532]  Folks, it's a good time to remind you that we here at InfoWars are the tip of the spear.
[03:29:25.592 --> 03:29:34.079]  But we cannot survive and we cannot defeat the extraordinary efforts to censor us without your support.
[03:29:34.519 --> 03:29:41.104]  So I urge you to go to the Infowars.com store where we have some unbelievable late July specials.
[03:29:41.785 --> 03:29:43.987]  Super Female Vitality, $29.95, 57% off.
[03:29:44.007 --> 03:29:45.168]  Silver Bullet, one of my favorites.
[03:29:50.892 --> 03:29:51.553]  99.95, almost 66% off.
[03:29:51.953 --> 03:29:55.475]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.396 --> 03:29:59.238]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:05.863 --> 03:30:10.206]  Every article, every video, but especially these articles and videos, we've been breaking down.
[03:30:11.812 --> 03:30:18.420]  Dealing with the martial law, civil war, assassination, removal, sudden removal, coup of Trump.
[03:30:18.901 --> 03:30:20.783]  All of this is now confirmed.
[03:30:21.143 --> 03:30:24.007]  Talk about sensationally fantastic.
[03:30:25.389 --> 03:30:27.071]  Talk about living in incredible times.
[03:30:27.151 --> 03:30:30.395]  Talk about America and the world at the crossroads.
[03:30:30.435 --> 03:30:30.915]  This is it.
[03:30:31.897 --> 03:30:34.520]  And now, more than ever, we need your financial support.
[03:30:34.600 --> 03:30:36.563]  We have the very best products you need.
[03:30:36.983 --> 03:30:39.487]  Incredible air filtration systems that are $219.
[03:30:39.527 --> 03:30:39.887]  Similar units are $400, $600.
[03:30:39.967 --> 03:30:41.149]  Used to be like $800 a few years ago.
[03:30:41.169 --> 03:30:42.070]  The prices are going down.
[03:30:42.090 --> 03:30:42.571]  They're $149 right now.
[03:30:49.840 --> 03:30:50.801]  $149, normally $219.
[03:30:51.402 --> 03:30:53.243]  That is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:30:53.363 --> 03:30:56.346]  The very same type systems, again, are $400 on average, upwards of $600.
[03:30:56.626 --> 03:30:59.729]  Pro Pure Travel are the very best gravity-fed systems out there.
[03:30:59.749 --> 03:31:00.149]  30% off, $132.
[03:31:00.269 --> 03:31:02.892]  The other competitors aren't even as good, and they sell them for $200, $230.
[03:31:02.992 --> 03:31:03.472]  That's $132 right now.
[03:31:07.876 --> 03:31:11.097]  Super Silver Special, the electric toothbrush that has silver impregnated in it.
[03:31:11.477 --> 03:31:11.938]  Amazing.
[03:31:12.118 --> 03:31:13.938]  And the Ploidal Silver toothpaste.
[03:31:14.459 --> 03:31:16.079]  Super Blue and the Silver Bullet.
[03:31:16.159 --> 03:31:18.060]  Ploidal Silver, 50% off.
[03:31:18.340 --> 03:31:19.420]  We've never done a special that big.
[03:31:19.761 --> 03:31:21.341]  Caveman Combo, 25% off.
[03:31:21.361 --> 03:31:23.402]  The Bone Broth, Super Female, 57% off.
[03:31:23.562 --> 03:31:25.023]  And why is that?
[03:31:25.103 --> 03:31:27.103]  Because we're basically sold out of the Super Male.
[03:31:27.203 --> 03:31:28.144]  I can't discount that.
[03:31:28.424 --> 03:31:31.225]  Super Female is very, very similar and works on men as well.
[03:31:31.265 --> 03:31:32.125]  But I want women.
[03:31:32.265 --> 03:31:33.686]  Never really caught on with women for some reason.
[03:31:33.746 --> 03:31:34.186]  It should.
[03:31:34.286 --> 03:31:37.047]  It's even more dramatic than what I've seen in women, when it comes to libido at least.
[03:31:37.287 --> 03:31:39.308]  But stamina, energy, just read the reviews.
[03:31:39.508 --> 03:31:43.189]  Super female, 57% off, and so many other big specials.
[03:31:43.209 --> 03:31:44.409]  DNA 4, 20% off.
[03:31:44.729 --> 03:31:46.670]  Free shipping until the end of this month.
[03:31:46.890 --> 03:31:50.471]  That's only a few more days and the huge sales of July are over.
[03:31:50.731 --> 03:31:57.073]  Please support the broadcast, support yourself, and help fund the InfoWar in the face of this oppressive assault, because we're having victory.
[03:31:57.173 --> 03:31:59.154]  InfoWarStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:31:59.174 --> 03:31:59.814]  Thanks for your support.
[03:32:04.045 --> 03:32:08.449]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:32:08.549 --> 03:32:19.479]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:32:19.639 --> 03:32:24.563]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:32:24.683 --> 03:32:27.205]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:32:27.265 --> 03:32:28.766]  It helps detoxify.
[03:32:28.966 --> 03:32:31.808]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:32:31.868 --> 03:32:36.612]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:32:36.632 --> 03:32:40.755]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[03:32:41.175 --> 03:32:48.202]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:32:48.322 --> 03:32:49.743]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[03:32:49.923 --> 03:32:50.664]  This is so key.
[03:32:50.924 --> 03:32:55.228]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[03:32:55.248 --> 03:32:57.350]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[03:32:57.470 --> 03:33:00.934]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:33:16.557 --> 03:33:23.112]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.633 --> 03:33:26.559]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:29.093 --> 03:33:33.556]  Thank you, and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.
[03:33:34.437 --> 03:33:46.325]  We got cut off there in the end, but I do want to say that there's a product now available at the InfoWars.com store, the True Whey Protein, which is 25% off.
[03:33:46.405 --> 03:33:48.407]  Now, folks, I want to be candid with you.
[03:33:48.447 --> 03:33:53.791]  You can go to the drugstore, you can go to the local Walgreens or CVS, and you can buy whey protein.
[03:33:54.676 --> 03:33:55.456]  But it's garbage.
[03:33:56.357 --> 03:34:00.438]  It's not the kind of quality that this protein is.
[03:34:00.458 --> 03:34:11.442]  This is a byproduct of milk and cheese that has been promoted for its health benefits, particularly for its muscle-building properties, and right now...
[03:34:12.662 --> 03:34:19.944]  There's an Ultimate Protein Pack that is 25% off both Caveman and the True Whey Protein.
[03:34:20.644 --> 03:34:22.325]  This is the best you can buy.
[03:34:22.685 --> 03:34:25.326]  The price beats anything you're going to find in the market.
[03:34:26.306 --> 03:34:41.390]  And you're not only going to be getting a product that you can count on, both great in my opinion for either a weight loss diet or a bodybuilding diet or just for health maintenance, but you're going to be helping the fight for freedom at the same time.
[03:34:42.490 --> 03:34:46.712]  This is an unbelievable kind of double deal here, folks.
[03:34:46.752 --> 03:34:58.998]  For $74.91, you're getting True Whey Protein, and you're getting Caveman, which has all the essential building blocks for optimum health and for athletic performance.
[03:34:59.378 --> 03:35:03.420]  I was skeptical about Caveman until I gave it a shot.
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:07.942]  I strongly recommend you grab this extraordinary protein packet.
[03:35:08.742 --> 03:35:16.008]  Pac, the benefits are extraordinary and you'll be helping fund the fight for freedom.
[03:35:16.828 --> 03:35:34.802]  We don't have a George Soros or a David Rockefeller type sitting in the background writing big checks to InfoWars to keep us on the air or to fund the incredibly exciting expansion that Alex Jones is working on.
[03:35:35.702 --> 03:35:40.105]  New studios, new talent, new programming, expanding the fight for freedom.
[03:35:40.725 --> 03:35:55.353]  We've got to raise the money and the only way we can do it is by bringing you some of the very best cutting-edge natural products and other First Amendment oriented products like the t-shirts that we have on online.
[03:35:56.034 --> 03:35:57.455]  And that is how we fight
[03:35:58.575 --> 03:35:59.256]  The Globalist.
[03:35:59.296 --> 03:36:04.198]  This is how we fund the fight for the First Amendment and for freedom of the press.
[03:36:04.238 --> 03:36:19.465]  So please, take just a minute, go to the InfoWars store, look at the many fine products there, but today I recommend the Whey Protein and Caveman Combo Protein Package at an extraordinary price that's 25% off, I believe, list.
[03:36:22.026 --> 03:36:32.956]  So, moving on, let's go back to the Awan brothers, because this is the story that the mainstream media refuses to put on page one.
[03:36:33.931 --> 03:36:39.717]  There are allegations, of course, that the Awans knew Seth Rich.
[03:36:40.217 --> 03:36:45.543]  They may have, in fact, based on what sources tell me, have partied with Seth Rich.
[03:36:45.623 --> 03:36:52.390]  There's so many missing time frames in terms of the night before.
[03:36:53.051 --> 03:36:53.911]  We know the D.C.
[03:36:53.931 --> 03:36:56.654]  Metropolitan Police has made no effort to get the
[03:36:57.715 --> 03:37:04.458]  Uh, video surveillance camera footage from the last bar that Seth was in.
[03:37:04.958 --> 03:37:10.640]  They made no effort to question the people who worked there, the bartender and so on.
[03:37:10.660 --> 03:37:19.384]  Uh, a blockbuster story by Dr. Jerry Corsi here on InfoWars last week shows how they purposely changed the time
[03:37:19.944 --> 03:37:32.253]  Of the report of a break-in into a car in which a gun owned by the FBI was stolen to try to give the impression that there was some connection to the Seth Rich murder.
[03:37:32.293 --> 03:37:41.040]  That's the kind of investigative reporting that you see here at InfoWars, folks, but you're not going to see at the New York Times or the Washington Post.
[03:37:41.880 --> 03:37:44.963]  So, why have the New York Times
[03:37:45.723 --> 03:37:59.172]  The Washington Post, and first and foremost, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, the major paper in Deborah Wasserman Schultz's district, given this story such scant coverage.
[03:37:59.872 --> 03:38:02.194]  What is it they are covering up?
[03:38:03.260 --> 03:38:16.535]  As I think you probably have heard, one of the Awan brothers attempted to flee the country last week, was actually pulled off of a jetliner at Dulles Airport in Washington D.C.
[03:38:16.615 --> 03:38:21.620]  by the FBI, seeking to leave the country after wiring
[03:38:22.521 --> 03:38:22.982]  At least $300,000.
[03:38:23.322 --> 03:38:34.189]  There are indications that he may have sent as much as $2 million on to Pakistan, where it appears the rest of his family fled.
[03:38:34.209 --> 03:38:39.974]  Here's the other interesting point that many in the mainstream media who are covering the story have missed.
[03:38:40.794 --> 03:38:44.137]  There's no evidence that the Awan brothers were IT geniuses.
[03:38:44.978 --> 03:38:54.807]  They have no extensive previous IT experience that would indicate that they have the kind of capabilities that they were even selling on Capitol Hill.
[03:38:55.747 --> 03:38:59.010]  Was this a Pakistani intelligence operation?
[03:38:59.871 --> 03:39:03.915]  It looks to me like the Awan brothers were getting technical help from someone.
[03:39:04.858 --> 03:39:09.182]  But, just as it is, the story is still Donald Trump Jr.
[03:39:09.723 --> 03:39:10.844]  Russian collusion.
[03:39:11.344 --> 03:39:22.675]  Nobody wants to talk about the Awan brothers, their alleged connection to Seth Rich, and ongoing developments in the Seth Rich murder case.
[03:39:24.127 --> 03:39:44.977]  Last week, The Atlantic, a left-wing magazine, posted an open letter from a Sandy Hook mother attacking me for simply saying on my Twitter feed, does anyone but me find it odd that Seth Rich's parents seem to have no interest in who killed their son?
[03:39:46.458 --> 03:39:47.638]  That's not over-the-top.
[03:39:48.459 --> 03:39:50.800]  That's not obnoxious or rude.
[03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:52.441]  That's common sense.
[03:39:53.547 --> 03:39:59.048]  Yes, of course, the privacy of Seth Rich's parents is important.
[03:39:59.888 --> 03:40:03.029]  But the truth is more important.
[03:40:03.629 --> 03:40:07.850]  And the mainstream media effort to cover up the truth in this matter.
[03:40:08.570 --> 03:40:14.231]  Well, that's why Alex Jones said only yesterday, this case needs investigation.
[03:40:14.751 --> 03:40:16.752]  The American people need to know.
[03:40:17.788 --> 03:40:32.034]  I'm looking forward to the opportunity to testify before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, because they operate from the get-go on the false premise that the Russians hacked the DNC's email server.
[03:40:32.914 --> 03:40:34.214]  I don't believe that's true.
[03:40:34.695 --> 03:40:39.156]  In fact, I think I can prove to the Senate and the House that it is false.
[03:40:41.311 --> 03:40:54.197]  See, they operate on a set premise and the mummy dummies in the 17 intelligence agencies endlessly repeat this narrative line, almost like they got a talking point memo.
[03:40:54.897 --> 03:41:01.841]  We've ascertained that the Russians hacked the DNC and that they interfered in the election.
[03:41:02.674 --> 03:41:08.796]  But they put forward no proof whatsoever that would stand up in a U.S.
[03:41:09.376 --> 03:41:10.516]  court of law.
[03:41:11.077 --> 03:41:12.717]  None whatsoever.
[03:41:12.737 --> 03:41:28.402]  I also want to report to you on a very exciting trip I took to Los Angeles to stand with Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate for Congress in the 43rd District
[03:41:30.001 --> 03:41:32.642]  Uh, facing Mad Maxine Waters.
[03:41:33.443 --> 03:41:45.829]  Now, in the, uh, in the nature of full disclosure, I want to say that I am a strategic consultant to his campaign, being paid the princely sum of one dollar.
[03:41:45.849 --> 03:41:54.493]  Uh, and I'm going to be, uh, watching this race because I think it is a template for the future.
[03:41:55.433 --> 03:42:05.756]  I give credit to Owen Shoyer as the journalist who first identified this as a key race and identified Omar Navarro as a hard charger.
[03:42:06.577 --> 03:42:10.458]  I can't tell you how impressed I am with this young man.
[03:42:11.418 --> 03:42:14.899]  And this race is not about left and right.
[03:42:15.399 --> 03:42:17.800]  It's not about globalists and nationalists.
[03:42:18.200 --> 03:42:20.161]  It's not about liberal and conservative.
[03:42:20.721 --> 03:42:23.102]  It's not about Republican and Democrat.
[03:42:24.266 --> 03:42:27.328]  It's about corruption and integrity in government.
[03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:32.892]  You see, Maxine Waters is among the most corrupt members of Congress.
[03:42:33.613 --> 03:42:36.375]  Maxine Waters put pressure on the U.S.
[03:42:36.415 --> 03:42:47.723]  government to bail out a failing bank, but never disclosed that she and her husband owned stock in that bank, and that her husband was on the board of directors.
[03:42:49.301 --> 03:42:53.002]  Maxine Waters' congressional committee has paid her daughter $600,000.
[03:42:54.563 --> 03:42:58.104]  For what?
[03:42:58.985 --> 03:43:00.445]  Her tough re-election campaigns?
[03:43:00.965 --> 03:43:02.746]  She hasn't had a race in years.
[03:43:03.953 --> 03:43:07.176]  And then they have what they call the Slate Scam.
[03:43:07.196 --> 03:43:08.477]  Let me explain that to you.
[03:43:09.078 --> 03:43:25.632]  This is where Maxine Waters and her posse create slate cards that look almost identical to the official slate card put forward by the Democratic Central Committee in the counties where she serves.
[03:43:26.633 --> 03:43:29.015]  Only this is the Maxine Waters slate.
[03:43:29.881 --> 03:43:37.525]  And if you're a down-ballot Democrat running for the Assembly or the County Commission or the City Council, well, you've got to pay up.
[03:43:38.105 --> 03:43:42.268]  And you've got to pay up big to get on the slate card.
[03:43:43.048 --> 03:43:44.269]  It's a scam, folks.
[03:43:44.869 --> 03:43:47.310]  She's using her position to make money.
[03:43:48.811 --> 03:43:57.836]  The irony of this is that Maxine Waters lives in a multi-million dollar mansion outside the district.
[03:43:58.777 --> 03:44:01.759]  She lives in the very affluent Hancock Park.
[03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:11.585]  She is eating filet mignon while her constituents can barely afford carne asada.
[03:44:12.645 --> 03:44:17.188]  This is among the poorest, most destitute districts in the country.
[03:44:18.359 --> 03:44:19.960]  The schools are terrible.
[03:44:20.461 --> 03:44:21.822]  They're like prisons.
[03:44:22.683 --> 03:44:25.285]  The streets and neighborhoods are unsafe.
[03:44:26.006 --> 03:44:29.689]  You take your life in your hands to go to some parts of this district.
[03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:31.851]  There are no jobs.
[03:44:32.592 --> 03:44:34.874]  There is no opportunity.
[03:44:35.514 --> 03:44:39.118]  There is no possibility of upward mobility.
[03:44:39.858 --> 03:44:44.683]  All there is is abject poverty and desolation.
[03:44:45.987 --> 03:44:48.691]  Yes, Maxine Water and her husband, there's their mansion.
[03:44:49.252 --> 03:44:56.182]  They live high on the hog, while their constituents are among the poorest folks in the nation.
[03:44:58.482 --> 03:45:10.971]  I have no doubt whatsoever that Omar Navarro will work to bring opportunity and safety and a better standard of living and better schools to this district.
[03:45:11.412 --> 03:45:13.193]  You see, Omar's not on the take.
[03:45:14.154 --> 03:45:18.637]  Omar's not running for Congress so he can line his own pockets.
[03:45:19.438 --> 03:45:25.683]  Omar Navarro's not running because he likes the social status and the money-making opportunities.
[03:45:26.716 --> 03:45:39.682]  Omar Navarro is running for Congress to serve the people and he will pursue policies much in line with the president that could bring opportunity and growth back to this district.
[03:45:40.463 --> 03:45:45.645]  There is one more important issue and it's really a problem for Maxine Waters.
[03:45:46.545 --> 03:45:51.848]  Yes, the James Brown Foundation, well they want their wig back.
[03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:57.392]  Thank you for joining me, Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:45:58.213 --> 03:46:08.938]  I do want to mention again that we have, right now in the last weeks of July, some incredible sales going on at the Infowars.com store.
[03:46:09.559 --> 03:46:19.624]  Now, there is a super silver special, which is the silver bullet plus super blue powder toothpaste, 50% off retail.
[03:46:23.266 --> 03:46:27.329]  This is a combination that my wife, Nydia, really loves.
[03:46:28.029 --> 03:46:30.951]  She has an extraordinarily gleaming smile.
[03:46:31.752 --> 03:46:45.001]  I can tell you she's tried all the, you know, drugstore-based, off-the-shelf products, and nothing has given her the whiteness and the natural look that she is justly proud of.
[03:46:45.601 --> 03:46:50.584]  So you can get the Super Silver Special at $34.93, which is silver bullet,
[03:46:53.346 --> 03:47:01.349]  Plus the Super Blue Power Toothpaste and Toothbrush at 50% off of retail.
[03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:04.230]  This is really a terrific deal.
[03:47:04.990 --> 03:47:05.730]  I recommend it.
[03:47:05.870 --> 03:47:07.191]  But let's look at some of the other things.
[03:47:08.171 --> 03:47:10.732]  ProPure Traveler, $132, 30% off of retail.
[03:47:10.892 --> 03:47:13.133]  Alexa Pure Breeze, 25% off of retail at $149.96.
[03:47:21.030 --> 03:47:22.951]  Knockout, this stuff is great.
[03:47:24.091 --> 03:47:26.612]  $14.95, 50% off of retail.
[03:47:27.393 --> 03:47:34.116]  Prostagard, this is an all-natural formula that protects your natural plumbing if you are a man.
[03:47:35.056 --> 03:47:43.560]  Saw Palmetto, yes, but zinc and other absolutely necessary natural ingredients for optimum performance.
[03:47:44.600 --> 03:47:53.408]  And then you have the conservatism is the new counterculture coffee mug, which I believe was developed by my friend Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:54.269 --> 03:48:00.874]  And DNA Force, $119.95, 20% off of retail.
[03:48:01.495 --> 03:48:09.022]  This is one of the products that I attribute to saving my life back in December when I believe I was poisoned.
[03:48:09.902 --> 03:48:13.245]  And it was a long crawl back, folks.
[03:48:13.825 --> 03:48:15.647]  I think I've never been so sick in my life.
[03:48:16.367 --> 03:48:29.057]  Sure, I went to the doctor, but I also loaded up on a number of the all-natural products at the Infowars.com store to try to boost my immunity and get back on track, and of course,
[03:48:29.858 --> 03:48:43.375]  I was able to complete my book, The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution, and you can get that also at the Infowars.com store.
[03:48:43.855 --> 03:48:45.517]  So, it's a two-way street.
[03:48:46.403 --> 03:48:49.724]  We will continue to fight here for liberty and the truth.
[03:48:50.424 --> 03:48:56.865]  We will bring you the breaking news on Deborah Wasserman Schultz, on the Seth Rich murder.
[03:48:57.285 --> 03:49:04.707]  We will highlight the egregious violations of civil liberties by the Obama NSA gang.
[03:49:05.007 --> 03:49:12.269]  The wiretapping, the surveillance, the reading of emails, text messages, the monitoring of phone calls.
[03:49:13.374 --> 03:49:17.148]  But believe me, those in the deep state would like to shut us up!
[03:49:18.021 --> 03:49:20.202]  They would like to close us down.
[03:49:21.023 --> 03:49:25.926]  They know we don't have any billionaire fat cats in the background writing big checks.
[03:49:26.587 --> 03:49:28.988]  We can only rely on you.
[03:49:29.909 --> 03:49:35.072]  So, please, InfoWarriors, do yourself a favor, but help the mothership.
[03:49:35.773 --> 03:49:36.714]  Go to the store now.
[03:49:36.814 --> 03:49:47.721]  Take advantage of these unbelievable July opportunities where you have really deep discounts on products that literally have thousands of testimonials.
[03:49:48.781 --> 03:49:54.845]  We would never put anything online, folks, that we didn't think was the very best of its genre.
[03:49:55.626 --> 03:49:59.968]  Alex Jones demands a testing regimen like nothing I have ever seen.
[03:50:00.108 --> 03:50:04.371]  Nothing second-rate will ever show up on the Infowars.com store.
[03:50:05.011 --> 03:50:05.512]  Help us.
[03:50:06.112 --> 03:50:06.792]  Help yourself.
[03:50:07.313 --> 03:50:08.293]  Help the revolution.
[03:50:08.673 --> 03:50:09.614]  Help the president.
[03:50:10.074 --> 03:50:11.995]  And help make America great again.
[03:50:12.636 --> 03:50:13.436]  Go to the store.
[03:50:14.757 --> 03:50:16.919]  And support us with your dollars.
[03:50:17.420 --> 03:50:19.442]  You'll be glad you did.
[03:50:20.142 --> 03:50:21.944]  We're going to come back here in just a moment.
[03:50:22.805 --> 03:50:24.527]  There's still a lot of news to cover.
[03:50:24.907 --> 03:50:27.209]  News you won't hear on the mainstream media.
[03:50:28.010 --> 03:50:35.517]  I got words moments ago that my appearance on the Don Lemon Show tonight on CNN has been cancelled.
[03:50:36.598 --> 03:50:42.241]  I didn't bother to shave because, frankly, I knew they would cancel at the time it was booked.
[03:50:42.881 --> 03:50:47.143]  Seems like the folks at CNN can't handle the truth.
[03:50:47.844 --> 03:50:54.807]  If you want the truth, you've got to come here to InfoWars.com with Alex Jones and the crew.
[03:50:55.307 --> 03:50:55.847]  Many thanks.
[03:50:56.207 --> 03:50:56.648]  I'll be back.
[03:51:06.325 --> 03:51:16.151]  Well, it doesn't matter if it's the Financial Times of London, or whether it's the Washington Post, or whether it's the Economist magazine, or the Harvard magazine.
[03:51:16.171 --> 03:51:19.053]  They all say globalism is collapsing.
[03:51:19.093 --> 03:51:20.113]  People are turning against it.
[03:51:20.413 --> 03:51:30.459]  We're not turning against internationalism, or being a citizen of the world if you want to live all over the world, or working with other countries, or accepting other cultures if you choose to adopt them.
[03:51:31.460 --> 03:51:38.744]  But we're not going to be ruled by carbon taxes that bureaucrats and Rothschilds and Rockefellers and Soroses make money from.
[03:51:38.804 --> 03:51:40.965]  It doesn't mean Brexit's perfect.
[03:51:40.985 --> 03:51:42.466]  It doesn't mean Trumpism is perfect.
[03:51:42.786 --> 03:51:47.708]  It means it's about taking the power back to the people, back to the states, back to the government.
[03:51:47.808 --> 03:51:52.691]  And Stefan Molyneux is a businessman, author, researcher, very popular radio TV host.
[03:51:53.051 --> 03:51:54.732]  Really appreciate him joining us for the next 30 minutes.
[03:51:55.072 --> 03:51:56.373]  Freedomainradio.com.
[03:51:56.633 --> 03:51:58.774]  Stefan Molyneux on Twitter.
[03:51:58.854 --> 03:51:59.995]  Freedomainradio on YouTube.
[03:52:00.655 --> 03:52:03.117]  Hundreds of millions of views, reaching tens of millions of people a week.
[03:52:03.317 --> 03:52:09.082]  Stefan Molyneux, looking at that, I mean, I don't know how to state the level of history we are at right now.
[03:52:09.142 --> 03:52:11.424]  I mean, I cannot overstate that to folks.
[03:52:11.524 --> 03:52:13.245]  We are at such an epic moment.
[03:52:13.706 --> 03:52:19.771]  It will never, ever in human history come down to as important a moment, Alex, and I really want to get this across to your listeners.
[03:52:20.391 --> 03:52:24.415]  If the state wins, if the globalists win, if the communists and the socialists win,
[03:52:24.995 --> 03:52:34.547]  Capitalism has delivered unto them such monitoring and control and video technology that it is entirely possible we will never ever be free again.
[03:52:34.968 --> 03:52:35.989]  It comes down to this.
[03:52:36.249 --> 03:52:40.695]  We have the technology to communicate free and peaceful and voluntary ideas across the world.
[03:52:41.075 --> 03:52:44.019]  They have the technology to control everything we do to monitor
[03:52:44.019 --> 03:52:44.419]  I think so.
[03:52:59.116 --> 03:53:07.378]  They're going to have a breakaway civilization, put us into total squalor, use it to control us, and then use the fruits of the human mind and open society that has given us almost god-like powers to shackle us!
[03:53:07.398 --> 03:53:08.678]  I mean, this is, this is...
[03:53:28.503 --> 03:53:29.664]  Unspeakably evil!
[03:53:29.704 --> 03:53:30.285]  What do we do?
[03:53:30.805 --> 03:53:31.386]  What do you do?
[03:53:31.646 --> 03:53:33.027]  You have to stop protesting.
[03:53:33.047 --> 03:53:34.368]  You have to start getting out there.
[03:53:34.388 --> 03:53:37.130]  You have to recognize that this is an emergency.
[03:53:37.170 --> 03:53:40.813]  There is no DEF CON level higher than what we are facing right now.
[03:53:40.873 --> 03:53:43.595]  You need to pull out all the stops, get all the information you can.
[03:53:43.915 --> 03:53:45.816]  You have a global communications network.
[03:53:45.836 --> 03:53:47.177]  You can tap into it anytime.
[03:53:47.218 --> 03:53:48.619]  You can challenge people in your life.
[03:53:49.059 --> 03:53:56.304]  It is down to this, because if we don't solve this peacefully, the kind of weapons that we have if it turns to war might end the entire planet.
[03:53:56.324 --> 03:53:56.745]  Wow.
[03:53:57.245 --> 03:54:01.406]  Stefan Molyneux, thank you always, uh, enlightening, but today was extremely powerful.
[03:54:01.466 --> 03:54:01.727]  Wow.
[03:54:07.969 --> 03:54:17.572]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:54:18.112 --> 03:54:23.614]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:54:23.674 --> 03:54:24.214]  Welcome back.
[03:54:26.135 --> 03:54:31.899]  I'm Roger Stone, here at InfoWars, sitting in for my good friend Alex Jones.
[03:54:33.540 --> 03:54:35.441]  I want to start a new thing here.
[03:54:35.481 --> 03:54:37.423]  We're going to call it Bad Guy of the Week.
[03:54:38.403 --> 03:54:46.429]  And we're going to try, in each segment, to identify an individual currently in government who needs to go.
[03:54:47.169 --> 03:54:51.992]  In this case, I have in mind Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
[03:54:53.092 --> 03:55:11.462]  Currently serving as the acting director of the FBI, or I guess now that Mr. Wray has been confirmed only yesterday, serving as the number two man at the FBI, this fellow has a number of actions of malfeasance and conflicts of interest that are most troubling.
[03:55:12.262 --> 03:55:33.523]  First of all, it is Mr. McCabe who authorized the spending of $50,000 of our tax money to pay for the phony dossier that was created in Europe and brought to our FBI for the purposes of smearing the President
[03:55:34.644 --> 03:55:52.612]  Based on completely false allegations that he engaged a group of prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel room for some period or, I guess, sexual reason.
[03:55:53.777 --> 03:55:58.379]  This whole story is a lie, a manufactured fairy tale.
[03:55:58.999 --> 03:56:14.706]  We now know that the Fusion GPS was involved, but what convinced Mr. McCabe that we would want to spend $50,000 of our tax dollars trying to forward this phony dossier?
[03:56:15.746 --> 03:56:43.167]  He also didn't bother to report that his wife, who was running for the State Senate, got a $675,000 infusion of cash from Terry McAuliffe, the Democrat governor of Virginia, the finance chairman for both Bill and Hillary's previous presidential campaigns, and a fellow who knows how to move money around.
[03:56:44.028 --> 03:56:49.683]  This, at the exact time that McCabe was supposed to be investigating Hillary Clinton.
[03:56:50.345 --> 03:56:52.511]  Sure smells like a payoff to me.
[03:56:53.786 --> 03:57:07.054]  And now, of course, McCabe is deeply involved, using the full force and might of the FBI as the thugs who are running the wide-scale witch hunt against the Trump family.
[03:57:07.774 --> 03:57:16.699]  Laura High Executioner Mueller, who we now know was appointed at the behest of White House Chief of Staff
[03:57:18.709 --> 03:57:30.833]  Reince Priebus, through the auspices of the number two man at the Justice Department, Rod Rosenstein, all at the behest of Democrat Congressman, yes, Elijah Cummings.
[03:57:32.054 --> 03:57:35.155]  The President needs to clean this rat's nest out.
[03:57:36.456 --> 03:57:40.977]  And I think Mr. McCabe should be among the first to go.
[03:57:42.278 --> 03:57:45.179]  So he is our bad guy for the week.
[03:57:46.461 --> 03:57:58.464]  While you're at it, folks, before we're done here, please go back to the Infowars.com website and pick up... I'm thinking now of the amazing t-shirts.
[03:57:58.584 --> 03:58:06.006]  I love the Trump-Pence 2020 t-shirt, the Hillary Clinton for President 2017 t-shirts.
[03:58:06.426 --> 03:58:09.867]  There were a lot of those at the Omar Navarro event the other night.
[03:58:10.547 --> 03:58:13.268]  This is the First Amendment in action, folks.
[03:58:13.788 --> 03:58:23.950]  So not only do we have these unbelievable sales, but you can get right into political activism and meet others who are info warriors like you.
[03:58:24.430 --> 03:58:26.310]  This is how we identify each other.
[03:58:26.350 --> 03:58:29.771]  There's no secret handshake, folks, but the t-shirts give it away.
[03:58:30.411 --> 03:58:35.972]  We need your support, and here's a fun, easy, and First Amendment-based way to do it.
[03:58:36.764 --> 03:58:38.627]  Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[03:58:39.068 --> 03:58:39.909]  Glad to be with you.
[03:58:40.249 --> 03:58:41.551]  Victory or death.
[03:58:45.698 --> 03:58:49.664]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.812 --> 03:58:58.974]  Rediscover your fire with the EcoZoom Coal Rocket Camping Stove.

[03:59:10.760 --> 03:59:16.703]  The Versa cooks fast, it produces less smoke, and it's fuel efficient.
[03:59:16.823 --> 03:59:21.025]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.
[03:59:21.445 --> 03:59:27.067]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.
[03:59:27.527 --> 03:59:32.829]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal and you've got yourself an entire meal.
