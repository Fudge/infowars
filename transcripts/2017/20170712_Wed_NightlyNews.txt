[00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:24.018]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:24.818]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:25.799]  It's Wednesday, July 12th, 2017.
[00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:26.960]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.281]  Tonight...
[00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:43.196]  The mainstream media takes another big bite out of a nothing burger, as they push yet another Trump-Russia conspiracy theory.
[00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:46.619]  This time, accusing Donald Trump Jr.
[00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:52.022]  of committing treason for meeting with a Russian lawyer prior to the election.
[00:00:52.283 --> 00:01:03.330]  But the real story is in the unreported details, as we now learn that the Russian lawyer appears to be a Soros mole and a deep state operative.
[00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.053]  With a long list of connections to everything anti-Trump.
[00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:16.138]  Then, the Associated Press has just released a book of new guidelines for journalists.
[00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:20.140]  And it looks like something straight out of a George Orwell novel.
[00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.763]  That's coming up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.692]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:40.094]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:48.641]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:52.244]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:52.404 --> 00:02:02.713]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:10.319]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.441]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:20.347]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:26.874]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.922]  We're here live and we have some breaking news.
[00:03:09.062 --> 00:03:16.229]  This afternoon we had Roger Stone and the Trump campaign being sued by a group of Obama lawyers.
[00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.693]  This was reported back in February that this group is being reported.
[00:03:19.713 --> 00:03:25.479]  Politico said Obama lawyers are forming a worst-case scenario group to tackle Trump.
[00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.222]  And they call this group United to Protect Democracy.
[00:03:28.262 --> 00:03:30.845]  This was taken from Obama's farewell address.
[00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:41.618]  Remember, Obama created the unprecedented situation of remaining in Washington and bringing aides and bringing lawyers and creating organizations like this to try to bring down the Trump administration.
[00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.021]  No congeniality here whatsoever.
[00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:46.923]  This is a coup that they're trying to organize.
[00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:57.432]  And so we have Alex Jones joining us live with this breaking news about this lawsuit blaming the WikiLeaks email dump on Roger Stone and the Trump campaign.
[00:03:57.512 --> 00:03:58.553]  Absolutely amazing, Alex.
[00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:00.155]  Absolutely.
[00:04:00.215 --> 00:04:08.582]  And remember, remember folks, everything with the Democrats and the Republican leadership is about disdain for the public, anyone that knows about law.
[00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:19.852]  Anyone that knows about basic facts knows that WikiLeaks was around for what, eight years, nine years before Trump even got on the political scene, that it's bipartisan and went after George W. Bush.
[00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:26.018]  Julian Assange has said that Trump has nothing to do with it and that Russians have nothing to do with it.
[00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:30.323]  It's well known that it's tied to Seth Rich on the DNC, and Obama said
[00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.435]  We're leaking all the info and getting all the facts out to people.
[00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:37.640]  He said this in January, January 9th to the New York Times.
[00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:39.964]  So that Trump can be brought down basically.
[00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:43.664]  Once he got into office, that is their operation.
[00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:46.705]  I know they couldn't just ignore the election on November 8th.
[00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:49.667]  So, they've been weaving this the whole time.
[00:04:49.727 --> 00:04:51.508]  They've said this in Atlantic Monthly.
[00:04:51.548 --> 00:04:53.269]  They've said this in the New Yorker Magazine.
[00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:54.710]  They've said this in The Economist.
[00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.454]  In all the elite publications, and by elite I mean the criminal, globalist publications where they openly communicate with each other.
[00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:04.976]  In Time Magazine and Newsweek, they just keep people in the dark.
[00:05:05.856 --> 00:05:08.338]  But they admitted the whole plan, and then let's not forget,
[00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:23.782]  It was a letter sent by one of the top Democrats on the Federal Elections Commission, the same folks that put the next of Susan in prison for no reason, saying that there's a criminal investigation being conducted, McClatchy, on myself, Breitbart, and drugs.
[00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:26.484]  That's what it said, you know, the counterespionage FBI group.
[00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:29.347]  He's looking to see if crimes were committed.
[00:05:29.487 --> 00:05:33.310]  It says crimes in her letter of us taking Russian money.
[00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:43.517]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, this is the Democratic Party who historically has been in bed with Communists, in bed with North Korea, in bed with China, in bed with Russia, when they were Communists.
[00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:46.939]  These are the groups that gave the reactors to North Korea in the mid-1990s.
[00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:50.242]  These are the folks with the Rosenbergs that gave the nukes to the Russians.
[00:05:50.662 --> 00:05:53.264]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:05:53.844 --> 00:06:02.690]  It has always been the Republicans that were fighting communism, not that they're perfect, but the Eisenhowers, and the Vice President Nixon at the time, and McCarthy, and all the rest of it.
[00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.591]  So this is so incredible.
[00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:05.652]  I read the complaint.
[00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:08.394]  As soon as I heard of the group, I went, wait, I heard that's a Soros group.
[00:06:08.694 --> 00:06:13.917]  So I searched the name, and sure enough, Soros put money into it six months ago, as you said.
[00:06:14.357 --> 00:06:15.518]  Obama runs it.
[00:06:15.578 --> 00:06:20.922]  His former chief counsel of the White House is the guy that filed the lawsuit.
[00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:29.989]  Well, for several plaintiffs who had their personal data put out because they were in pacts against Trump, as if Trump had anything.
[00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:33.732]  There is not one micron of evidence that Trump did that.
[00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:39.216]  They keep claiming that Stone, that Roger Stone, was talking to WikiLeaks.
[00:06:39.676 --> 00:06:41.578]  Of course he was trying to talk to WikiLeaks.
[00:06:41.858 --> 00:06:43.019]  WikiLeaks is on The Guardian.
[00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:44.520]  WikiLeaks is on Fox News.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.702]  Of course he was trying to get the scoop from WikiLeaks.
[00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:49.524]  So were we, but it's all on record.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:56.023]  That he talked to Guccifer 2.0 and other people on public forums after the fact.
[00:06:56.063 --> 00:06:57.764]  I mean, this is wild.
[00:06:57.864 --> 00:07:07.989]  And ladies and gentlemen, Roger was poisoned with polonium because they wanted to get him out of the way ahead of these hearings that he's going to now testify at the 24th.
[00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:10.690]  So ladies and gentlemen, it is on.
[00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.392]  They are calling for hearings on Capitol Hill.
[00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:18.296]  For yours truly, now watch, they'll end up cancelling them because I can't wait to testify.
[00:07:18.316 --> 00:07:19.257]  I'll only do it in public.
[00:07:19.277 --> 00:07:21.118]  I don't even need some stinking lawyer.
[00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:25.580]  This is like saying, I'm Jeffrey Dahmer, or I'm a Martian, or, or, you know.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.721]  I mean, this is the craziest crap.
[00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:29.302]  But folks, we took America back.
[00:07:29.762 --> 00:07:31.083]  We're beginning to take it back.
[00:07:31.723 --> 00:07:33.244]  And it shows a special understatement.
[00:07:33.264 --> 00:07:34.205]  They own everybody.
[00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:36.034]  And they're doing this.
[00:07:36.475 --> 00:07:37.855]  I mean, Roger is ecstatic.
[00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:38.675]  He's here in town.
[00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:40.976]  We're working on launching a syndicated show with him.
[00:07:41.297 --> 00:07:45.318]  David Knight's new syndicated show is going to launch in late August.
[00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:47.859]  Stone's show is going to launch in September.
[00:07:47.939 --> 00:08:01.785]  And, you know, I was on the fence about having him be a full-time employee, but, you know, because of this today we were doing contract negotiations, I'm just going to go ahead and go with the big contract and the whole nine yards for Roger to officially work with us, because I want to double down against this type of intimidation.
[00:08:02.794 --> 00:08:03.795]  We're good to go.
[00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:23.589]  We're good to go.
[00:08:53.588 --> 00:09:02.170]  I look at these cowardly, rat-like lawyers and how pathetic they are, and just the fact that they know under law, these are the most frivolous lawsuits in history.
[00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.051]  I talked to Roger.
[00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.032]  He is planning to file bar complaints on all of them, and then lawsuits.
[00:09:07.072 --> 00:09:10.913]  Believe me, this is textbook harassment.
[00:09:11.213 --> 00:09:12.453]  Textbook stunt.
[00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:19.287]  They're so desperate just to make it look like, oh, well, there must be something if they're being sued.
[00:09:19.327 --> 00:09:25.350]  It was the same thing with Chobani and all their, oh, they settled real quick, and let's just say we're happy with the settlement.
[00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:32.713]  That's all this is, is for PR stunts, ladies and gentlemen, because these people have nothing left.
[00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:34.214]  They know the giant's awake.
[00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:36.034]  They know you're not listening to the propaganda.
[00:09:36.074 --> 00:09:37.035]  Last point, back to David.
[00:09:37.235 --> 00:09:39.916]  He's got a lot to cover and a lot of pieces, I know, and we're live right now.
[00:09:41.377 --> 00:09:44.220]  Right when the show ends, I'm doing a Facebook Mentions from my house.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.681]  Michael Zimmerman is coming over here.
[00:09:45.701 --> 00:09:47.202]  He's working 14 hours a day.
[00:09:47.222 --> 00:09:49.684]  The crew is so great.
[00:09:49.724 --> 00:09:50.525]  He's coming here to my house.
[00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:52.867]  Roger is leaving his hotel in downtown Austin.
[00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:54.809]  He's coming to my house in West Austin.
[00:09:55.189 --> 00:10:04.717]  We're going to sit down at my dinner table and do a live feed at 8 o'clock, right when this live feed ends, on Facebook Mentions and on our own streams and at fullwords.com forward slash show.
[00:10:05.097 --> 00:10:06.819]  This is a big deal to have.
[00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:10.483]  Trump and Roger Stone being sued by Obama's lawyers.
[00:10:10.663 --> 00:10:12.705]  Federal judges are involved in the lawsuit.
[00:10:13.066 --> 00:10:15.228]  I mean, these people are bullies in my view.
[00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:16.369]  They are thugs.
[00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.853]  And I welcome their slanderous defamation.
[00:10:19.873 --> 00:10:22.456]  I welcome the slanderous defamation of the...
[00:10:23.893 --> 00:10:26.274]  FEC, the Federal Elections Commission.
[00:10:26.354 --> 00:10:30.256]  I mean, this is just pure desperation by these people.
[00:10:30.576 --> 00:10:32.877]  And they are just despicable garbage.
[00:10:32.897 --> 00:10:43.643]  These are the most un-American slimeballs that see that the country is flyover and hate Christians and are just absolutely so upset that they can't strangle the country completely anymore.
[00:10:43.923 --> 00:10:45.483]  And the sleeping giant is awakening.
[00:10:45.523 --> 00:10:49.005]  So back to David Knight and the amazing crew with InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:10:49.305 --> 00:10:50.626]  This is a hell of a time to be alive.
[00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:52.807]  Everybody, support us financially in your prayers.
[00:10:53.207 --> 00:10:54.467]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:55.608]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:10:55.748 --> 00:10:56.688]  And I salute you all.
[00:10:56.728 --> 00:10:57.408]  Back to David Knight.
[00:10:57.828 --> 00:10:58.409]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:00.149]  And it truly is amazing news.
[00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:05.210]  And remember, he said right after the live broadcast here of the nightly news at 8 p.m.
[00:11:05.591 --> 00:11:07.151]  Central Time, 9 p.m.
[00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:11.312]  Eastern, he will be doing a Facebook Mentions Live to further break this down.
[00:11:11.332 --> 00:11:14.873]  Now, we look at the way this is being reported by TPM Talking Points memos.
[00:11:15.113 --> 00:11:17.094]  They're calling this a watchdog group.
[00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:19.737]  And as we pointed out before, this is not a watchdog group.
[00:11:19.777 --> 00:11:22.600]  This is Obama's lawyers, okay?
[00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:27.406]  The head of the Obama administration that he put together as he left office.
[00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:31.852]  And they even named this group the phrase, United to Protect Democracy.
[00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:33.794]  That was taken from his farewell address.
[00:11:33.814 --> 00:11:34.796]  He wasn't going anywhere.
[00:11:35.276 --> 00:11:41.080]  He was planning on staying in Washington, as reported, that had never been done by any former president.
[00:11:41.381 --> 00:11:44.803]  Usually they go off and they're quiet, even if it changes to the other party.
[00:11:44.843 --> 00:11:46.605]  They don't get into that kind of opposition.
[00:11:46.645 --> 00:11:50.368]  But he created a structure to continue to attack Trump.
[00:11:50.388 --> 00:11:53.490]  And we're going to tell you why later in the broadcast.
[00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.191]  Why they don't like Donald Trump.
[00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:55.812]  And you know why.
[00:11:56.212 --> 00:11:58.333]  We're going to break down some more examples of this.
[00:11:58.373 --> 00:12:01.775]  We've got CNN actually using Al-Qaeda as ISIS.
[00:12:01.795 --> 00:12:02.736]  That's a story coming up.
[00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:06.198]  And I just want to look at what the New York Times called this.
[00:12:06.418 --> 00:12:10.360]  Like I said, TPM called them a watchdog group, this group of Obama lawyers.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.461]  The New York Times just called them Democrats.
[00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:13.422]  So it's a little bit closer.
[00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:14.522]  They're not a watchdog group.
[00:12:14.722 --> 00:12:15.503]  They are Democrats.
[00:12:15.563 --> 00:12:19.025]  But more specifically, this is the Obama administration.
[00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:32.216]  And as Alex said, Roger Stone is saying he's going to not only file counter lawsuits, but bar complaints for these kinds of frivolous lawsuits trying to come after him and destroy his reputation.
[00:12:32.456 --> 00:12:34.017]  He dismissed the lawsuit today in a quote.
[00:12:34.037 --> 00:12:38.661]  He said this is a desperate maneuver of a pack of pathetic losers.
[00:12:39.381 --> 00:12:43.084]  There are losers, and let's understand that they know that as well.
[00:12:43.604 --> 00:12:44.605]  What is really behind this?
[00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:54.731]  We had an article at Infowars.com today from Paul Joseph Watson pointing out that just 4% of Democrats think that Hillary would have a chance of beating Trump in 2020.
[00:12:55.132 --> 00:13:03.697]  So why do they think that she could have beat him if she had not been interfered with in some way, some magical, nebulous way by the Russians?
[00:13:03.757 --> 00:13:08.020]  They won't say, they say it was hacked, but they say, no, no, no, they actually didn't change any votes.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:08.841]  What did they do?
[00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:11.082]  Well, they told us the truth about Hillary.
[00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:15.444]  That's why only 4% of even the Democrats think that she could win.
[00:13:15.604 --> 00:13:22.748]  And most interestingly, they say 50% of Democrats think that no candidate currently being considered would be able to beat Trump.
[00:13:23.028 --> 00:13:24.569]  This is what they're concerned about.
[00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:27.531]  This is why they're creating the false narratives.
[00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:31.633]  They're desperate to find something, anything that'll stick, but they still don't have anything.
[00:13:32.213 --> 00:13:33.874]  They don't have anything with Donald Trump Jr.
[00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:35.155]  Let's understand
[00:13:36.195 --> 00:13:45.217]  That these continuing rotating gotchas that they think they've got are nothing but another case of guilt by proximity.
[00:13:45.437 --> 00:13:46.918]  It's not even guilt by association.
[00:13:47.138 --> 00:13:50.979]  It's just vague proximity to somebody, making some connections to someone.
[00:13:51.439 --> 00:13:52.479]  There's no allegations.
[00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:53.899]  There's no charges.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.660]  It's just slander.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.982]  And that's what we're seeing with this latest lawsuit.
[00:13:59.262 --> 00:14:05.766]  Now we do have some Democrats coming out, and we cannot take this seriously, but we do need to play this for you.
[00:14:06.206 --> 00:14:11.510]  This is Chris Cuomo on CNN suggesting that Donald Trump Jr.
[00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.111]  committed treason.
[00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:14.972]  Here's the Democrat talking points.
[00:14:14.992 --> 00:14:15.652]  Let's play that clip.
[00:14:16.433 --> 00:14:19.335]  Do you think the meeting that Donald Trump took, Donald Trump Jr.
[00:14:19.355 --> 00:14:21.256]  took, do you think the meeting that Donald Trump Jr.
[00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:22.757]  took was a violation of the law?
[00:14:23.371 --> 00:14:23.811]  I don't know.
[00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:25.433]  It's not for me to say.
[00:14:25.913 --> 00:14:26.874]  The standard is tight.
[00:14:26.954 --> 00:14:29.016]  Treason is a very tight statute.
[00:14:29.176 --> 00:14:30.737]  The FEC laws are about solicitation.
[00:14:30.757 --> 00:14:31.938]  But Chris, you're a smart guy.
[00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.119]  You know this isn't treason.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.281]  It's not my call.
[00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:44.569]  And you know, by the way, Jay, look, like I feel about running down the road of Hillary Clinton every time something is brought up about the president, I feel the same way about legalities.
[00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:45.950]  Leave it to the special counsel.
[00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:48.673]  Okay, that was Chris Cuomo talking to Jay Sekulow.
[00:14:49.662 --> 00:14:51.563]  Who is a lawyer with the Trump administration.
[00:14:52.063 --> 00:14:57.987]  And he says, uh, you got any specific... Oh, well, you know, treason is not up to me to decide what treason... Well, actually it does have a very specific definition.
[00:14:58.707 --> 00:15:03.950]  And if he had half a brain, and perhaps he does have half a brain, that he knows that it doesn't meet that definition.
[00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.071]  But let's take a look at some of the other things that have happened.
[00:15:06.091 --> 00:15:09.954]  We've had now one month after Texas Democrat Representative Al Green
[00:15:10.774 --> 00:15:16.375]  Grandstanded on the floor, this is from Zero Hedge, saying that, I'm not doing this for political purposes.
[00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:17.496]  Oh no, not at all.
[00:15:17.896 --> 00:15:19.676]  Remember he filed impeachment.
[00:15:19.716 --> 00:15:22.857]  He says he introduced his own article of impeachment against Donald Trump.
[00:15:22.877 --> 00:15:23.157]  Why?
[00:15:23.617 --> 00:15:26.378]  Because he fired FBI Director Comey.
[00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:30.959]  Even the Democrats were celebrating that until they realized, oh wait a minute, we're not supposed to celebrate that.
[00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:32.560]  They had to be informed.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.281]  By the comedian Stephen Colbert.
[00:15:36.521 --> 00:15:37.081]  No, no, no, no.
[00:15:37.961 --> 00:15:39.362]  This is something you should be upset about.
[00:15:39.382 --> 00:15:40.502]  They were applauding it at first.
[00:15:41.043 --> 00:15:45.645]  And so now we've had yet another one come out and do this, saying this is obstruction of justice.
[00:15:45.685 --> 00:15:46.745]  It's not obstruction of justice.
[00:15:46.765 --> 00:15:51.187]  As a matter of fact, he appointed somebody else to continue the investigation, even though there's nothing there.
[00:15:51.837 --> 00:15:55.500]  It's going above and beyond what is necessary, but he did not obstruct justice.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:02.164]  It was clearly within his prerogative to remove the FBI director, who was part of the executive branch.
[00:16:02.584 --> 00:16:10.630]  Even Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, as Zero Hedge pointed out, agreed that nobody had provided a smoking gun to justify impeachment on the grounds of obstruction.
[00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.292]  But now, today, we have another Democrat.
[00:16:13.812 --> 00:16:20.037]  Coming out and saying that Trump's abrupt firing of James Comey as FBI Director amounts to obstructing of justice.
[00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:23.260]  And as they point out, he's not going to succeed.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:23.921]  Why?
[00:16:24.661 --> 00:16:31.387]  Because when you do impeachment, you have to have the House vote on it, and you have to have the Senate try it.
[00:16:31.507 --> 00:16:32.028]  And guess what?
[00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:35.014]  We have a majority of Republicans there.
[00:16:35.034 --> 00:16:40.157]  Now we're going to talk about what this may look like because there was some breaking news out of Brazil.
[00:16:40.778 --> 00:16:53.525]  There's been an impeachment last year of their president and she was the hand-picked successor of the guy that was sentenced today to nine and a half years in prison for corruption, for money laundering, for taking bribes.
[00:16:53.986 --> 00:16:55.607]  That's what needs to happen in America.
[00:16:56.207 --> 00:17:07.333]  We're going to take a look at what's going on, the way they responded, and what will happen here if we ever get a Justice Department that gets serious about coming after these criminals, because that's what's really going on here.
[00:17:08.033 --> 00:17:23.901]  As Alex pointed out, this lawsuit coming after Roger Stone and the Trump campaign for the emails that were released by a DNC whistleblower, according to WikiLeaks, and saying that you somehow interfered with the election or whatever.
[00:17:24.978 --> 00:17:36.505]  The reality is that all of this noise that they're making is to cover up the crimes of the Democrats and of the intelligence community, which is acting like Watergate burglars.
[00:17:37.466 --> 00:17:41.188]  This is a very politicized law enforcement and intelligence community.
[00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:43.109]  That's something that we need to be very worried about.
[00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:52.896]  Yesterday we talked about Republicans introducing bills to allow congressmen to carry weapons in all 50 states and the District of Columbia for their protection.
[00:17:53.618 --> 00:17:56.339]  Now this is something that we should all be protected for.
[00:17:56.419 --> 00:17:58.660]  We have a God-given right to carry weapons.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.520]  It's respected by the Second Amendment.
[00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:10.404]  But these congressmen understand that they're going to be the first ones that are the most desirable targets, as they have just seen.
[00:18:10.704 --> 00:18:19.347]  They need to understand that when it comes to free speech and to privacy, that they are also the prime targets of this surveillance state that they have created.
[00:18:20.007 --> 00:18:22.048]  And they need to shut down that surveillance state.
[00:18:22.088 --> 00:18:23.328]  I think some of them are seeing it now.
[00:18:23.388 --> 00:18:27.589]  Perhaps they're too compromised, too blackmailed to do anything about it.
[00:18:27.849 --> 00:18:40.292]  But just as we saw with the shooting of Steve Scalise and other congressmen at the baseball practice situation, they are also the prime targets for the intelligence community that has become politicized and criminal.
[00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:49.154]  Violating the law, as the FISA court explained to us, told us that the FBI and the NSA had violated the law, violated the FISA Act.
[00:18:49.634 --> 00:19:00.701]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:15.891 --> 00:19:17.972]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:19:18.152 --> 00:19:20.974]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:21.414 --> 00:19:22.735]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:31.739]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:34.060]  It is a classical 360Win.
[00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:38.343]  Our formula at InfoWarsLife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:39.023 --> 00:19:44.266]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality,
[00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:47.486]  Of purity and of strength.
[00:19:48.427 --> 00:19:51.827]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:52.227 --> 00:19:59.809]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years since we launched in 4 Wars Life to actually come up with this.
[00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:11.811]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:12.071 --> 00:20:26.525]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:20:27.006 --> 00:20:27.746]  You owe it to yourself.
[00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:38.336]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:38.396 --> 00:20:46.683]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:46.883 --> 00:20:53.629]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the new world order.
[00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:58.394]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:58.834 --> 00:21:00.176]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[00:21:00.817 --> 00:21:02.600]  With Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.191]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:12.411 --> 00:21:16.513]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:16.533 --> 00:21:29.759]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:30.359 --> 00:21:31.980]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.181]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:36.162]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:36.742 --> 00:21:39.183]  That's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:39.523 --> 00:21:41.945]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:45.226]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:45.246 --> 00:21:46.887]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:47.127 --> 00:21:52.369]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:52.389 --> 00:21:52.970]  Again.
[00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:59.458]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:59.859 --> 00:22:04.185]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:04.766 --> 00:22:08.591]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:10.633 --> 00:22:13.354]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:31.779]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com, with the new Bubblegum Flavor Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack, because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:34.942]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[00:22:34.982 --> 00:22:37.004]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:37.384 --> 00:22:39.366]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:39.827 --> 00:22:51.418]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:51.478 --> 00:22:54.581]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:15.031]  Welcome back.
[00:23:15.612 --> 00:23:25.877]  As a reminder of those of you just joining our broadcast, Alex Jones joined us at the beginning of the broadcast telling us that former Obama administration lawyers who formed a group to target Donald Trump.
[00:23:25.957 --> 00:23:27.658]  Remember, Obama stayed in Washington.
[00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:30.800]  This is his purpose, to try to take down the Trump administration.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.003]  They've now filed suit against Roger Stone and the Trump campaign because of WikiLeaks.
[00:23:36.383 --> 00:23:38.367]  This is how insane this is.
[00:23:38.447 --> 00:23:39.589]  Every day we see something else.
[00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:42.233]  When we look at the Donald Trump Jr.
[00:23:42.314 --> 00:23:46.481]  emails in this meeting with this one, we're going to take a look at her Natalia Veselnitskaya.
[00:23:47.432 --> 00:23:55.795]  When we look at that, we have to understand that this is, just as we saw with Chris Cuomo, they don't make any charges or accusations.
[00:23:56.076 --> 00:23:57.416]  They produce no evidence.
[00:23:57.776 --> 00:24:00.877]  This is guilt by proximity, not even by association.
[00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:03.058]  They just throw these words out there, like, well, treason.
[00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:04.379]  I don't know if it's treason.
[00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:05.900]  I don't really know what the definition of treason is.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.100]  But it might could be treason.
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:07.580]  Oh, no, no.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.141]  So they throw this out there.
[00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:10.621]  This is propaganda, folks.
[00:24:10.661 --> 00:24:12.502]  This is manipulation of people.
[00:24:12.542 --> 00:24:13.783]  And that's what this lawsuit is about.
[00:24:14.523 --> 00:24:23.267]  Alex is going to be doing a live Facebook Mentions after the end of this broadcast at the 8 o'clock hour Central Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time.
[00:24:23.487 --> 00:24:24.967]  Let's take a look at who this woman is.
[00:24:25.368 --> 00:24:27.448]  Natalia Veselnitskaya.
[00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:30.490]  Now don't get that confused with Boris and Natasha.
[00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.310]  You know, remember Boris and Natasha?
[00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.671]  You gotta go get the moose!
[00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:39.393]  But it is very similar in terms of the cartoon stereotypes.
[00:24:39.533 --> 00:24:40.254]  Very, very similar.
[00:24:40.894 --> 00:24:44.497]  Now, we have an article on Infowars.com from Don Salazar.
[00:24:44.538 --> 00:24:48.621]  The Russian lawyer did attend Chicago anti-Trump rallies.
[00:24:48.922 --> 00:24:52.505]  And we can take a look at the pictures of all these feminist rallies.
[00:24:52.525 --> 00:24:57.630]  Remember they had the women's rally, the women's march in Chicago the day after Trump's inauguration.
[00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.693]  And she was posting all of this on her Facebook account.
[00:25:00.993 --> 00:25:07.801]  She is not a supporter of Donald Trump, and we're going to see just how much of a non-supporter of Donald Trump she is.
[00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:14.969]  But also interesting is the fact that sitting next to Veselnitskaya is Ayman Al-Ghraib.
[00:25:15.109 --> 00:25:18.053]  He is one of the Russians who set up this meeting.
[00:25:18.113 --> 00:25:20.035]  Let's talk about this meeting and how it got set up.
[00:25:22.331 --> 00:25:26.515]  Agor Lavrov, I guess is how you pronounce his name.
[00:25:26.835 --> 00:25:28.477]  He is a Russian real estate tycoon.
[00:25:28.517 --> 00:25:30.399]  His son is a pop star in Russia.
[00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:35.403]  And the guy who is the showbiz manager who contacted Donald Trump Jr.
[00:25:36.084 --> 00:25:38.486]  is the manager of the son who is the pop star.
[00:25:38.846 --> 00:25:41.068]  Now, how did he know Donald Trump?
[00:25:41.128 --> 00:25:45.512]  Well, in 2013, Trump's Miss Universe contest was held in Moscow.
[00:25:46.153 --> 00:25:48.275]  And this guy helped to co-produce that.
[00:25:48.795 --> 00:25:52.077]  They also talked about setting up a hotel, but that never happened.
[00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:57.140]  So that was three years before Donald Trump even ran for office, and nothing came of that.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.282]  But he did have a connection into Donald Trump.
[00:26:00.702 --> 00:26:05.065]  That's the Russian side of Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr.
[00:26:05.365 --> 00:26:06.686]  Is there really that much there?
[00:26:07.306 --> 00:26:08.047]  I don't think so.
[00:26:08.627 --> 00:26:12.670]  We're going to take a look at the connection, however, with Natalia and these other people.
[00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:17.713]  Her proximity, as we point out in the InfoWars article, to Obama's Russian ambassador.
[00:26:18.553 --> 00:26:23.336]  ...is questionable given her recent testimony to NBC News that she has no ties to the Russian government.
[00:26:23.717 --> 00:26:27.179]  The lawyer's also been tied, however, to Fusion GPS.
[00:26:27.199 --> 00:26:27.779]  Do you remember them?
[00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:35.084]  They're the people who worked with the former British spy Christopher Steele to produce the dirty dossier.
[00:26:35.424 --> 00:26:37.526]  So here we are now for the third attempt.
[00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:39.067]  We're good to go.
[00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:19.488]  This Russian real estate oligarch, and the fact that she has absolutely nothing on her, there's no way to contact her on her website.
[00:27:19.528 --> 00:27:25.610]  She has no office, no website presence, there's no office address, no telephone number.
[00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:26.770]  Who is this woman?
[00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:31.271]  Well, we do have a lot of connections with her in the Democrat Party.
[00:27:32.111 --> 00:27:38.792]  If we, and also with the Obama administration, the same people that just sued Roger Stone over WikiLeaks.
[00:27:39.153 --> 00:27:41.653]  I mean, these people are just absolutely amazing.
[00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:51.555]  Gateway Pundit pointed out today, well looky here, the Russian lawyer, Veselnitskaya, is pictured with Obama's ambassador to Russia just eight days after the Donald Trump Jr.
[00:27:51.575 --> 00:27:51.855]  meeting.
[00:27:52.295 --> 00:27:59.017]  So she may not have connections with the Russians, maybe she does, maybe she doesn't, but she does have a lot of connections to the Democrat Party.
[00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:00.418]  I want to take a look at that.
[00:28:00.838 --> 00:28:12.745]  She told NBC News on Monday that she was not with the Kremlin, as was reported by New York Times, and the law firm where she's listed as a managing partner is based in a Moscow suburb, does not even have a website, as I just pointed out.
[00:28:13.226 --> 00:28:14.787]  This whole thing may be a shell.
[00:28:14.827 --> 00:28:17.508]  There's no working phone number, there's no email, there's no website.
[00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:26.374]  Putin's spokesperson said on Monday when this broke that the Kremlin was unaware of a meeting between Trump's senior staff and Veselnitskaya.
[00:28:26.934 --> 00:28:28.615]  Doesn't know who that is, he said.
[00:28:28.855 --> 00:28:35.237]  And they went on to say, obviously we can't monitor all meetings that Russian lawyers hold both in Russia and abroad.
[00:28:35.357 --> 00:28:42.719]  However, she was sitting with Obama's ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, during a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing eight days.
[00:28:43.499 --> 00:28:45.501]  After the cold contact with Donald Trump.
[00:28:45.521 --> 00:28:49.964]  And remember at this meeting, that lasted for anywhere between five and ten minutes.
[00:28:50.004 --> 00:28:50.925]  There was nothing given.
[00:28:51.285 --> 00:28:53.007]  There was nothing taken by either side.
[00:28:53.447 --> 00:28:54.768]  There was absolutely nothing there.
[00:28:54.808 --> 00:29:01.494]  The whole thing appears to be set up so that they could have guilt by proximity, not even association.
[00:29:03.183 --> 00:29:13.308]  So, it's very interesting to take a look at the connections here, and of course, Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele are very much connected with the DNC and with CrowdStrike.
[00:29:13.328 --> 00:29:23.072]  And we go back and look, and I'll repeat this again, it's not 17 agencies, it's not 4 agencies or even 3 agencies that said the Russians were involved in the election.
[00:29:23.752 --> 00:29:28.654]  It was a report from CrowdStrike, the DNC contractor that controlled their emails.
[00:29:29.494 --> 00:29:38.498]  They came up with the idea that the Russians hacked this, rather than a whistleblower who was angry about the corruption within the DNC shutting down Bernie Sanders.
[00:29:39.258 --> 00:29:50.242]  That's what the UK, former UK ambassador who now is affiliated with Wicked League said, I went to the United States, I was handed the information by someone who was a disgruntled DNC staffer.
[00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:53.423]  And shortly after that we had Seth Rich die.
[00:29:54.303 --> 00:29:57.584]  So there's a lot of connections there that indicate that it's in the opposite direction.
[00:29:57.685 --> 00:30:01.326]  And of course we've been told by Julian Assange, as Alex pointed out earlier as well,
[00:30:01.986 --> 00:30:06.630]  That it was not the Russians, it wasn't any state organization, it was people within the DNC.
[00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:13.295]  And Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have a very good record in terms of telling the truth, unlike the Democrats.
[00:30:13.335 --> 00:30:16.338]  Let's take a look at this Washington Times article here.
[00:30:16.378 --> 00:30:21.962]  Democrats intentionally use disinformation from Russia to attack Trump and campaign ads.
[00:30:22.062 --> 00:30:23.563]  This is the issue, folks.
[00:30:24.084 --> 00:30:30.209]  It's the Democrats who are doing this, the Democrats who are trying to hack our election, who are trying to create a coup at this point.
[00:30:30.589 --> 00:30:34.770]  They say Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Trump.
[00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.011]  They did this during the election with Christopher Steele.
[00:30:38.051 --> 00:30:44.232]  He was paid by a Democrat-funded opposition research firm, Fusion GPS, with money from a Hillary Clinton backer.
[00:30:44.672 --> 00:30:49.893]  Fusion GPS distributed the dirty dossier, and so did, by the way, John McCain.
[00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:51.913]  Remember, he was shopping that dossier around.
[00:30:52.214 --> 00:30:58.355]  It's the establishment, both Republican and Democrat, who are so adamantly opposed to Donald Trump.
[00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:05.161]  An advisor for the Trump campaign who asked not to be identified said if anyone colluded with the Russians, it was the Democrats.
[00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:11.927]  After all, they routinely shopped around false claims from the debunked Steele dossier which listed sources including senior Kremlin officials.
[00:31:12.268 --> 00:31:15.130]  If anyone should be investigated in Washington, it ought to be Adam Schiff.
[00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:17.212]  Mark Warner and others, okay?
[00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:19.753]  It was first reported by the Washington Times back on April 25th.
[00:31:20.033 --> 00:31:29.716]  Steele filed a document in a sealed court case in London acknowledging that a major dossier charge about hacking Democrats' computers was unverified.
[00:31:30.116 --> 00:31:36.119]  The entire dossier should never have been made public, he said, and Fusion GPS should not have passed it around.
[00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:41.641]  He said this in a filing to defend himself against a libel charge in the UK.
[00:31:42.919 --> 00:31:48.120]  And Mr. Seals, Russian sources accused Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, remember this, when they accused him of attending a meeting?
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.001]  And he wasn't.
[00:31:49.041 --> 00:31:50.461]  He was in California at the time.
[00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:56.082]  This is one lie after the other to hide Democrat corruption.
[00:31:56.943 --> 00:32:05.085]  And now we learn today, we look at a Zero Hedge article, that it's Heritage Capital, Ziff Brothers, and the Clinton Global Initiative that prompted this meeting.
[00:32:05.965 --> 00:32:24.012]  This was all based on a decade-old story about tax evasion, and the Hermitage Capital manager that was involved in this, William Broder, and his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, had blown the whistle on what they said was corruption in Moscow.
[00:32:24.072 --> 00:32:33.135]  Magnitsky was arrested, they say that he died after being tortured in custody, and in retaliation the Obama administration created the Magnitsky Act,
[00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:36.878]  And then Russia retaliated by shutting down adoptions.
[00:32:36.978 --> 00:32:39.201]  That's what they were talking about, presumably.
[00:32:39.241 --> 00:32:52.014]  It's a very complicated situation, but again, it involves people who are contributors to the Clinton Global Initiative, and Democrat organizations, and people who work for the Democrats.
[00:32:52.255 --> 00:32:53.876]  It's the Democrats, stupid!
[00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:55.098]  That's what we need to understand.
[00:32:55.138 --> 00:32:56.239]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[00:34:26.238 --> 00:34:33.821]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.

[00:34:44.284 --> 00:34:46.205]  And this part is most important.

[00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.071]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:03.951 --> 00:35:08.333]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:08.433 --> 00:35:19.377]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:19.537 --> 00:35:24.458]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:24.578 --> 00:35:27.099]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:27.159 --> 00:35:28.639]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:31.700]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:36.501]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:36.521 --> 00:35:42.762]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:35:42.802 --> 00:35:48.084]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:48.864]  I'm taking it now.
[00:35:49.224 --> 00:35:50.045]  We're good to go.
[00:36:04.181 --> 00:36:10.344]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:10.744 --> 00:36:13.625]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:13.945 --> 00:36:19.147]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:19.567 --> 00:36:25.550]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.831]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:30.412]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:30.632 --> 00:36:34.776]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:34.956 --> 00:36:37.818]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:37.918 --> 00:36:39.480]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:42.763]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:43.043 --> 00:36:45.365]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:45.645 --> 00:36:46.606]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:46.706 --> 00:36:49.408]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:50.169]  I take this.
[00:36:50.289 --> 00:36:51.991]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:52.091 --> 00:36:54.073]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:54.894 --> 00:36:55.676]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:55.696 --> 00:36:56.538]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:37:13.117 --> 00:37:13.637]  Welcome back.
[00:37:13.657 --> 00:37:21.522]  I want to take a quick look at what's going on in Brazil, because I think this is the future, someday, someday soon, of America.
[00:37:22.223 --> 00:37:31.729]  We have a former Brazilian president today who was sentenced to over nine years in prison for corruption, for money laundering, for bribe-taking.
[00:37:31.789 --> 00:37:32.670]  He was found guilty today.
[00:37:33.724 --> 00:37:45.670]  And it was just last August that his hand-picked successor, he was president of Brazil from 2003 to 2011, his hand-picked successor, Rousseff, was impeached last August.
[00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.672]  And prior to that, the previous November, she had won election.
[00:37:50.572 --> 00:37:51.974]  We're good to go.
[00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:15.792]  Facing trial charges over corruption, but he was able to shut it down.
[00:38:15.872 --> 00:38:19.878]  They did not get the votes necessary to bring him up on corruption charges.
[00:38:20.579 --> 00:38:25.446]  But going back to the lady who was impeached last August, Rousseff.
[00:38:26.147 --> 00:38:28.368]  When she was elected, she was very unpopular.
[00:38:28.588 --> 00:38:30.429]  She was a hardcore socialist.
[00:38:30.749 --> 00:38:33.351]  Also, these corrupt parties, like our Democrats, are socialists.
[00:38:34.091 --> 00:38:35.852]  And she had tanked the economy.
[00:38:35.892 --> 00:38:36.852]  She was very unpopular.
[00:38:36.872 --> 00:38:38.753]  She was down 10 points in the polls.
[00:38:39.374 --> 00:38:44.456]  She was booed at soccer games with 60,000 people in attendance.
[00:38:45.377 --> 00:38:47.138]  And then, the day of the election,
[00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:49.594]  She won by 10 points.
[00:38:49.914 --> 00:38:56.581]  And the people who normally did the exit polling, which is the gold standard for seeing if there is massive corruption.
[00:38:56.621 --> 00:39:01.807]  So from being down 10 points the day before, she wins by 10 points the day of the election.
[00:39:02.207 --> 00:39:03.369]  And there's no exit polling.
[00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:08.771]  There's one organization that does it, very similar to the United States here, where we have one polling organization.
[00:39:08.811 --> 00:39:12.812]  You notice that when they do exit polls in the United States, they never give you totals.
[00:39:12.852 --> 00:39:20.075]  They never come in and say, well, the actual vote total in this area for this candidate was this, and this is what the exit polls told us.
[00:39:20.135 --> 00:39:20.315]  No.
[00:39:20.715 --> 00:39:24.497]  They give us demographic cross-tabulation, so we can't see that information.
[00:39:24.577 --> 00:39:27.418]  It's hidden from us by the one organization that does it.
[00:39:28.138 --> 00:39:35.220]  And so they tell us how many women voted for a particular candidate or how many of this particular ethnic group voted for which candidate.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.861]  But they don't give us the grand total so that we can look at whether or not there's corruption.
[00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:45.943]  And of course that's what the State Department of the United States uses to look at corruption in other elections.
[00:39:46.343 --> 00:39:47.623]  Why is this important to us?
[00:39:47.823 --> 00:39:50.944]  Because we use the same electronic voting machines.
[00:39:51.664 --> 00:39:57.546]  In many cases, the electronic voting machines were created first in Venezuela by Hugo Chavez.
[00:39:58.306 --> 00:40:02.508]  Smartmatic began that way, and they've changed their names a number of times.
[00:40:03.428 --> 00:40:18.013]  That's why we're very concerned in places like Texas, where we have the Department of Elections shutting down the legal and constitutional requirements to have an image of the ballot, to have numbers on the ballot, so that we can audit the election.
[00:40:18.133 --> 00:40:20.554]  That's the way these kinds of crooked people get in.
[00:40:21.434 --> 00:40:27.176]  And when we see what is happening there, the kind of blowback that is happening, again, this guy may be corrupt, I don't know.
[00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:39.399]  The current president, Michael Timmer, may be corrupt, or it may be blowback, as we would expect to see here in the United States if we ever have a Justice Department that gets serious about coming after these corrupt Democrats.
[00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:49.725]  Who have corrupted our law enforcement, the FBI, the NSA, and our intelligence agencies to use them as political operatives, to use them as Watergate burglars.
[00:40:49.825 --> 00:40:51.066]  That's what needs to be shut down.
[00:40:51.126 --> 00:40:56.289]  And if we do, we're going to have a war just like they have going on in Brazil right now to get rid of the corruption.
[00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.871]  Before we run out of time, I want to take a look at this story from Mint Press.
[00:40:59.992 --> 00:41:01.993]  Because you know, we've had this contest here at InfoWars.
[00:41:02.533 --> 00:41:08.337]  CNN is ISIS because of Kathy Griffin holding up the severed head of Donald Trump.
[00:41:09.332 --> 00:41:12.374]  Well, you know, ISIS and Al-Qaeda, they're the same thing, aren't they?
[00:41:12.995 --> 00:41:22.002]  And we have Al-Qaeda propagandist has been employed by CNN to make a prize-winning Syrian documentary.
[00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:34.572]  What a surprise that the network that is so closely associated with the military-industrial complex and the CIA would use an Al-Qaeda propagandist to film their award-winning documentary.
[00:41:35.509 --> 00:41:43.054]  Yet another controversy for the embattled network, this is coming from Met Press, has come to light in the making of its award-winning Undercover in Syria documentary.
[00:41:43.094 --> 00:41:57.984]  The documentary revolves around CNN reporter Clarissa Ward's quote-unquote undercover trip to extremist-held portions of Aleppo that pushed for a Western intervention in Syria last year, and it places the blame for the city's suffering on the Russian, Syrian, and Iranian governments.
[00:41:58.604 --> 00:42:01.327]  After the documentary aired, Ward was invited by then U.S.
[00:42:01.387 --> 00:42:09.094]  Ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, that was Obama's ambassador, to testify on her experiences in rebel-held Aleppo.
[00:42:09.315 --> 00:42:22.667]  However, CNN hired a known member of Al-Qaeda, his name is Bilal Abdul Kareem, in order to obtain the on-the-ground footage that they used in the documentary and to assist the CNN reporter
[00:42:23.348 --> 00:42:23.728]  We're good to go.
[00:42:53.368 --> 00:42:55.792]  That is working with CNN to do this documentary.
[00:42:56.233 --> 00:43:02.763]  He said the network has recently sought to distance itself from its key source on the ground after the documentary started picking up awards.
[00:43:03.384 --> 00:43:04.766]  He noticed this and he tweeted it out.
[00:43:04.806 --> 00:43:07.730]  He said on Twitter, he said, a piece that I filmed with CNN
[00:43:08.972 --> 00:43:24.577]  Yeah, you don't forget to mention people who contribute to a movie, unless they happen to be Al-Qaeda contributors and you're CNN, and then you don't want people to know that.
[00:43:24.637 --> 00:43:37.422]  CNN, as they point out, likely didn't forget him, but instead intentionally chose to exclude his name once it gained fame, as he is a well-known English-language propagandist for Jabhat Al-Nusra, otherwise known as the Al-Nusra Front.
[00:43:37.822 --> 00:43:40.163]  Which is the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:40.443 --> 00:43:41.804]  Which is the same as ISIS, folks.
[00:43:41.864 --> 00:43:44.645]  I mean, we got all these different names, but you have to understand what it is.
[00:43:45.486 --> 00:43:53.870]  While he denied being affiliated with Al-Qaeda, he said in a Facebook video, he says, I am not, nor have I ever been, nor do I need to be a part of Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.170]  I don't have any need for that.
[00:43:55.631 --> 00:44:01.974]  Nevertheless, his privileged access to Al-Nusra members, being able to get the CNN reporter into places where other reporters are killed,
[00:44:02.714 --> 00:44:04.915]  And Territory suggests just the opposite.
[00:44:04.955 --> 00:44:18.801]  They said the video where he denies ties to Al-Qaeda, he also states that the reason he has not faced the same dangers as other journalists in the Al-Nusra territory, the territory that is held by Al-Qaeda, is because of mutual respect.
[00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:20.862]  Between him and Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:21.322 --> 00:44:23.442]  And Al-Qaeda's host, U.S.
[00:44:23.482 --> 00:44:27.784]  Jihadist Bilal Abdul Kareem, put him on their Ramadan show.
[00:44:28.424 --> 00:44:33.726]  He's just been praised by al-Nusra's religious leader as our media man just last month.
[00:44:34.286 --> 00:44:37.747]  Even though his denial of ties to the groups are coming out there.
[00:44:37.787 --> 00:44:39.828]  So, Al-Qaeda says he's our media man.
[00:44:40.568 --> 00:44:42.689]  And CNN uses him for their documentary.
[00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:45.730]  Now, see they lie to us in so many different ways.
[00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:46.210]  I've got
[00:44:47.426 --> 00:44:56.555]  All of my liberal Facebook friends back in North Carolina are passing around this article from the Washington Post saying that Sweden is the best country in the world to be an immigrant.
[00:44:56.935 --> 00:45:01.880]  My wife sent this to me and said, can you believe that they are this ignorant about what is going on in Sweden?
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.222]  I said, yes, absolutely I can.
[00:45:03.522 --> 00:45:08.987]  Because none of that is ever told by the Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN, all these other groups.
[00:45:09.027 --> 00:45:10.929]  They want to hide that information from you.
[00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:15.573]  This is a new ranking of the best countries to be an immigrant has placed Sweden in the top spot.
[00:45:15.774 --> 00:45:22.179]  That's especially if you like to have your pick of blonde, blue-eyed girls that you can rape at will because they're just asking for it.
[00:45:22.479 --> 00:45:23.961]  You know, those non-Muslim women.
[00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:27.664]  And they say Sweden has become a popular destination for refugees from Africa.
[00:45:27.744 --> 00:45:29.345]  And as I've pointed out many times,
[00:45:30.131 --> 00:45:32.852]  You want to talk about refugees from Africa, the Muslims that are there.
[00:45:32.892 --> 00:45:41.195]  They have Little Mogadishu, an area that is so out of control criminally that they have to bust the police in with armed escorts.
[00:45:41.235 --> 00:45:43.355]  And they've created a massive fortress there.
[00:45:43.395 --> 00:45:47.897]  And of course, we're creating our own Little Mogadishu right here in Minneapolis.
[00:45:48.317 --> 00:45:51.258]  And even though the press wants to cover this up,
[00:45:51.818 --> 00:46:01.602]  And even though we have the government trying to cover up situations like what happened in Sweden and what happened in Cologne, Germany on the New Year's celebrations, we have that here in America as well.
[00:46:02.002 --> 00:46:08.024]  San Francisco Transit is now withholding surveillance tapes to avoid creating racial stereotypes.
[00:46:08.644 --> 00:46:11.305]  See, if you're criminals, they don't want people to see this.
[00:46:11.485 --> 00:46:18.708]  Even though they've got 40 to 60 teenagers, in one instance, getting on a train and robbing seven passengers, beating up two.
[00:46:18.749 --> 00:46:21.350]  Then another incident, they had four teens assaulting a passenger.
[00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:28.313]  Two days later, a dozen teens snatched the phone of a woman on the train, but the transportation system there, BART,
[00:46:29.033 --> 00:46:34.417]  ...has said that they're not going to publish surveillance footage because it would create a negative racial perception.
[00:46:35.038 --> 00:46:36.639]  They don't want you to understand.
[00:46:37.039 --> 00:46:44.966]  That's why the story we had today from Paul Joseph Watson saying, Reuters is banning words like terrorist and Islamist because it's not politically correct.
[00:46:45.026 --> 00:46:49.269]  It wasn't enough for them to take away undocumented immigrants.
[00:46:49.329 --> 00:46:50.650]  That's not even good enough for them.
[00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:55.414]  These are people who are struggling to enter Europe, struggling to enter our country.
[00:46:55.814 --> 00:47:03.685]  Stay with us, we're going to have Owen Schroyer and he's going to be looking at Democrats who refuse to disown the website that publishes satanic porn.
[00:47:04.226 --> 00:47:09.033]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:09.694 --> 00:47:11.276]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:11.636 --> 00:47:16.641]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:17.002 --> 00:47:22.447]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:22.848 --> 00:47:29.434]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:30.095 --> 00:47:31.236]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:32.077 --> 00:47:34.018]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:34.339 --> 00:47:37.300]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:37.741 --> 00:47:41.363]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:41.543 --> 00:47:44.105]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:44.165 --> 00:47:56.513]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:56.713 --> 00:48:01.837]  Other iodine comes from the ocean, or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[00:48:01.957 --> 00:48:03.298]  It's bound.
[00:48:03.579 --> 00:48:04.579]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.420]  I tried it.
[00:48:06.021 --> 00:48:09.563]  And I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[00:48:09.784 --> 00:48:14.687]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:15.168 --> 00:48:20.072]  Do yourself and your family a favor, and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:20.152 --> 00:48:21.313]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:21.473 --> 00:48:24.055]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:24.195 --> 00:48:25.376]  I don't think so.
[00:48:47.025 --> 00:48:49.687]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:49.707 --> 00:48:50.728]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:51.068 --> 00:48:51.768]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:51.788 --> 00:48:52.409]  You must have it.
[00:48:52.769 --> 00:49:00.314]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:49:00.334 --> 00:49:01.195]  We can answer your questions.
[00:49:01.215 --> 00:49:01.255]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:05.967 --> 00:49:18.152]  Well, every day it seems like the Democrats are getting crazier and crazier, and it's starting to reach a point where I'm reading these stories, I'm seeing what's happening, and I'm not even believing it.
[00:49:18.612 --> 00:49:23.354]  And that was the case again today in Washington, D.C.
[00:49:23.454 --> 00:49:24.295]  Now, there was a
[00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:29.659]  An event that was backed by certain Democrat Senators.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:35.325]  Blumenthal, Markey, Wyden, and Franken were backing this event, Fight for the Future.
[00:49:35.745 --> 00:49:44.814]  This has been an event that has been backed by Pornhub and RedTube, pornographic websites, as well as the Women's March, in cahoots with these Democrat Senators.
[00:49:44.834 --> 00:49:48.517]  I'm now joined by Jack Posobiec, who is in Washington for this event.
[00:49:49.298 --> 00:49:59.304]  When I saw your video, when I saw the flyer that you made to try to raise awareness to these Senators for what they were backing, I honestly didn't even believe it.
[00:49:59.464 --> 00:50:01.565]  I couldn't even believe what I was seeing.
[00:50:02.025 --> 00:50:11.451]  Tell me, when you heard about this, obviously you took action, but what was the first thought that came to your head when you saw these Democrat Senators were working an event with these pornographic websites?
[00:50:12.233 --> 00:50:30.241]  Yeah, the first thought that came to my head was, boy, isn't this the Democrat Party that tells us they're on the side of right, they're on the side of morality, they're on the side of, you know, they always have the moral compass, they're always trying to bash President Trump for, you know, saying a mean tweet or tweeting out something they think is, you know, promoting violence.
[00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:38.384]  Well, here they are standing with some of the most, you know, and I'm not saying it's illegal, but I'm saying it is some of the most brutal and appalling
[00:50:38.704 --> 00:50:39.224]  We're good to go.
[00:50:55.151 --> 00:51:00.132]  Well, and it was incredible, again, just the fact that they would be associated with this event.
[00:51:00.152 --> 00:51:10.055]  I mean, you know, whatever you want to say about those websites and the legality or the moral issues, honestly, that's not even the debate that I'm trying to have here.
[00:51:10.395 --> 00:51:13.496]  I'm just scratching my head that a Democrat would even want to associate with this.
[00:51:14.016 --> 00:51:18.440]  And I think it really goes along with this whole net neutrality argument, you know?
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:25.225]  They're trying to pin the term net neutrality as a positive thing, just like they did with the Affordable Care Act.
[00:51:25.325 --> 00:51:26.486]  Oh yeah, it'll be affordable.
[00:51:26.746 --> 00:51:27.987]  It'll be the Affordable Care Act.
[00:51:28.267 --> 00:51:29.308]  Oh yeah, this is net neutral.
[00:51:29.348 --> 00:51:30.169]  It'll remain neutral.
[00:51:30.409 --> 00:51:31.710]  Well, it's the same point that I have.
[00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:32.951]  You know, the Internet's fine.
[00:51:33.051 --> 00:51:34.492]  The Internet is not broke, okay?
[00:51:34.533 --> 00:51:35.774]  We don't need to fix the Internet.
[00:51:35.994 --> 00:51:37.295]  We didn't need to fix insurance.
[00:51:37.315 --> 00:51:38.436]  We didn't need to fix healthcare.
[00:51:38.456 --> 00:51:38.856]  It was fine.
[00:51:39.096 --> 00:51:40.417]  It seems like they're doing the same thing.
[00:51:40.677 --> 00:51:42.359]  It's really just a government power grab.
[00:51:43.106 --> 00:51:45.667]  Yeah, that's exactly my thought.
[00:51:45.927 --> 00:51:52.350]  Talking about net neutrality, why exactly do we need massive government regulations then to make it neutral and free?
[00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:56.792]  In my experience, massive government regulations tend to do the exact opposite.
[00:51:56.812 --> 00:52:01.635]  And it's one of those things where they're playing Big Brother, George Orwell-type games where they're saying, oh, it's going to be affordable.
[00:52:01.655 --> 00:52:01.935]  No, no, no.
[00:52:01.975 --> 00:52:03.055]  It's going to be neutral now.
[00:52:03.395 --> 00:52:10.559]  All you have to do is put all of these Democrat legislation, all of these George Soros-backed policies behind it, and it'll be totally fine.
[00:52:10.599 --> 00:52:11.139]  Totally fine.
[00:52:11.579 --> 00:52:12.579]  So let me get this straight.
[00:52:12.699 --> 00:52:18.262]  Fight for the Future is a movement that is trying to gain support for net neutrality.
[00:52:18.642 --> 00:52:23.784]  You had these porn sites that were backing it, and then you also had these Democrats that were backing it.
[00:52:23.824 --> 00:52:27.885]  So they're basically all supporting net neutrality as one combined force.
[00:52:27.925 --> 00:52:28.826]  That's what's going on here.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:34.882]  Yeah, and you can actually throw $15,000 a month from George Soros' funding for the future.
[00:52:35.142 --> 00:52:36.523]  And they're not even trying to hide it.
[00:52:36.863 --> 00:52:41.264]  It is directly associated with George Soros' Open Societies Foundation.
[00:52:41.384 --> 00:52:45.066]  It is a project of George Soros, openly and publicly.
[00:52:45.748 --> 00:52:53.772]  Well, you know, Donald Trump could have a salad that has Russian dressing on it, and he would have to have vowed that 500 times before they believe him.
[00:52:54.332 --> 00:53:02.977]  And you actually asked a few of the senators that were out there today if they would disavow these websites that have violent porn on them, as you're pointing out in your flyer.
[00:53:03.337 --> 00:53:04.117]  Here's that video.
[00:53:04.337 --> 00:53:05.878]  Me here with all my allies.
[00:53:05.938 --> 00:53:09.260]  This is an important time that all of us must be involved in.
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.821]  Senator Blumenthal here.
[00:53:11.861 --> 00:53:12.121]  No.
[00:53:12.661 --> 00:53:15.123]  Senator Blumenthal.
[00:53:15.343 --> 00:53:16.384]  A quick yes or no.
[00:53:16.404 --> 00:53:17.364]  Just a quick yes or no.
[00:53:17.384 --> 00:53:18.725]  That's all I'm asking.
[00:53:18.745 --> 00:53:19.685]  A quick yes or no.
[00:53:20.506 --> 00:53:25.449]  And we'll not disavow Senator Blumenthal.
[00:53:25.489 --> 00:53:32.132]  Senator Wyden, Senator Blumenthal, you asked yes or no, will you disavow violent, satanic porn on these websites.
[00:53:32.172 --> 00:53:32.592]  That's all.
[00:53:32.893 --> 00:53:34.353]  You didn't ask about net neutrality.
[00:53:34.493 --> 00:53:35.634]  You didn't ask about anything else.
[00:53:36.074 --> 00:53:37.055]  And they wouldn't respond to you.
[00:53:38.123 --> 00:53:40.205]  No, they wouldn't respond to me, and they wouldn't even give a comment.
[00:53:40.225 --> 00:53:47.532]  In fact, at one point, Senator Blumenthal actually said he would give me a comment, but very telling, his staffer stepped in and said, oh, no comment for you.
[00:53:49.134 --> 00:53:50.155]  He just said he would talk to me.
[00:53:50.375 --> 00:53:52.497]  I just want to ask him a basic question about this.
[00:53:52.917 --> 00:53:56.281]  I mean, he's getting, what, $180,000 a year in U.S.
[00:53:56.301 --> 00:53:56.781]  tax money?
[00:53:57.101 --> 00:54:00.665]  I just want to know why he's appearing at an event that's supported by Pornhub and RedTube.
[00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:06.357]  Yeah, again, I'm looking at this story right now that the crew just pulled up.
[00:54:06.397 --> 00:54:07.679]  Is that the Daily Beast guys?
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.806]  Yeah, and they're trying to paint it like you're saying net neutrality equals satanic porn.
[00:54:12.846 --> 00:54:14.288]  No, they're missing the point.
[00:54:14.428 --> 00:54:17.112]  My point that it seems like you're making to me is that
[00:54:17.873 --> 00:54:22.438]  What you have is Democrats colluding with these porn sites that have satanic porn on them.
[00:54:22.458 --> 00:54:22.939]  That's all!
[00:54:23.199 --> 00:54:24.601]  You're not saying anything's illegal.
[00:54:24.621 --> 00:54:27.044]  You're not making any claims against net neutrality, really.
[00:54:27.064 --> 00:54:30.387]  You're just saying, hey, why are you out here with these porn sites that have this porn on it?
[00:54:30.407 --> 00:54:31.649]  Will you disavow satanic porn?
[00:54:31.689 --> 00:54:32.129]  They say no.
[00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:33.110]  But here's the thing.
[00:54:33.371 --> 00:54:34.692]  This is why it shouldn't shock us.
[00:54:35.433 --> 00:54:38.796]  Let's look at some of the activity of the Democrats real quick, and I want to get Jack's comments here.
[00:54:39.136 --> 00:54:42.339]  Alright, so first, look at this story from the Washington Examiner.
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:46.042]  California Democrats legalize child prostitution.
[00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:55.431]  Now, they tell you that this is so, you know, the pimps or whoever is handling these underage sex workers, you know, they can't get the underage sex workers in trouble.
[00:54:55.651 --> 00:54:59.474]  But again, this is the pattern of thinking from the left that doesn't make sense.
[00:54:59.674 --> 00:55:02.297]  This really just opens the door for child prostitution.
[00:55:02.597 --> 00:55:04.318]  They don't understand how that logic works.
[00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:08.341]  It's just like if you make a law to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, they'll hand them over.
[00:55:08.381 --> 00:55:09.202]  That's not how it works.
[00:55:09.502 --> 00:55:10.743]  But then again, here's a new one.
[00:55:11.203 --> 00:55:15.146]  Effort to bar child marriage in California runs into opposition.
[00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:19.369]  So you've got actual Democrats that have been shocked by this.
[00:55:20.427 --> 00:55:20.567]  That's
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:46.505]  Staffer, the mayor of New York, who has really just made himself look like the absolute scumbag he is in the last month.
[00:55:47.006 --> 00:55:50.148]  You've got his staffer, Top Staffer, arrested for child pornography.
[00:55:50.649 --> 00:55:53.411]  You've got Anthony Weiner and everything that went on with him.
[00:55:53.451 --> 00:55:55.733]  You've got the spirit cookings in the Podesta emails.
[00:55:55.753 --> 00:55:57.775]  You've got the weird art that the Podestas enter into.
[00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:02.319]  We should not be surprised that the Democrats would not disavow satanic porn.
[00:56:03.854 --> 00:56:16.843]  Yeah, and it really strikes an interesting context when we talk about the sort of desensitization to some of this stuff, the sort of normalization of these different types of acts in American society.
[00:56:16.863 --> 00:56:26.850]  And I think that's really more the bigger question here is, we're not talking about should it be illegal, should it not be illegal, but what exactly are we making available and what are we normalizing in terms of society?
[00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:33.693]  I hate to play it, so it's almost cliched at this point, but could you imagine, Owen, if Donald Trump was tweeting out links to Pornhub?
[00:56:33.713 --> 00:56:34.133]  Oh my gosh.
[00:56:34.153 --> 00:56:35.373]  We're going to an event.
[00:56:35.893 --> 00:56:36.994]  We're going to an event.
[00:56:37.054 --> 00:56:37.334]  Yeah.
[00:56:37.414 --> 00:56:37.694]  Yeah.
[00:56:38.635 --> 00:56:39.595]  And it's just amazing.
[00:56:39.655 --> 00:56:41.336]  Again, you know, here's what they're going to do.
[00:56:41.356 --> 00:56:42.236]  I'm already seeing this.
[00:56:42.296 --> 00:56:43.957]  I can already see the tea leaves here.
[00:56:43.977 --> 00:56:45.457]  They're going to say, look at Jack Posobiec.
[00:56:45.477 --> 00:56:46.698]  He's being an extremist.
[00:56:46.978 --> 00:56:49.119]  He's linking net neutrality to Pornhub and RedTube.
[00:56:49.679 --> 00:56:51.260]  Well, that's the whole point.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.321]  They're the ones that put their names out there.
[00:56:53.381 --> 00:56:55.282]  They're the ones that are supporting net neutrality.
[00:56:55.362 --> 00:56:57.724]  They're the ones that link themselves to this movement.
[00:56:58.124 --> 00:56:59.665]  All you're doing is shedding light on that.
[00:56:59.705 --> 00:57:01.186]  If you want to call that extreme, fine.
[00:57:01.506 --> 00:57:02.387]  But what, you know what?
[00:57:02.407 --> 00:57:03.967]  We've got to fight fire with fire here.
[00:57:04.028 --> 00:57:06.309]  And again, you play the same cliche.
[00:57:06.729 --> 00:57:13.873]  If it was the Trumps doing this, if it was Donald Trump Jr., or imagine if Mike Pence, I mean, he wouldn't be caught dead at an event like this.
[00:57:13.913 --> 00:57:16.375]  But you can't even imagine the response from the left.
[00:57:17.055 --> 00:57:21.517]  Yeah, you'd have that, the hand-wringing all over the place, the fake outrage.
[00:57:21.757 --> 00:57:22.617]  Oh my goodness!
[00:57:22.937 --> 00:57:26.759]  How, you know, demeaning the office, demeaning the over-moralization.
[00:57:26.779 --> 00:57:28.119]  It's so un-presidential, yeah.
[00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:30.480]  How is this a role model for our children?
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:33.081]  How can this be a role model for our daughters and sons?
[00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:35.602]  You know, you could play the same line over and over.
[00:57:35.882 --> 00:57:37.043]  And you know exactly who it would be.
[00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:39.325]  And there'd be a lot of Republicans in there, too, I think.
[00:57:39.365 --> 00:57:47.490]  Some of these more establishment Republican types who would be wringing their hands, talking about demeaning, this is unpresidential, beneath the office of the President.
[00:57:47.691 --> 00:57:49.132]  Well, what about the office of the Senate?
[00:57:49.372 --> 00:57:54.135]  What about the office of United States Senators being paid by taxpayer dollars, appearing at an event by this?
[00:57:54.415 --> 00:57:57.838]  Yeah, the Daily Beast is trying to say that I'm the one who connected them to these websites.
[00:57:57.878 --> 00:57:58.258]  No, no, no.
[00:57:58.638 --> 00:58:04.743]  They're connected to it on the actual website for the event, where the logos for these organizations are.
[00:58:05.063 --> 00:58:10.685]  And meanwhile, you've got Democrats that are digging holes everywhere, looking up each other's butts for any Russian collusion they can find.
[00:58:10.725 --> 00:58:11.605]  They can't find anything.
[00:58:11.965 --> 00:58:13.806]  All you're doing is actually pointing to facts.
[00:58:13.826 --> 00:58:15.306]  You're saying, here's these websites.
[00:58:15.547 --> 00:58:16.727]  Here's what's on these websites.
[00:58:17.687 --> 00:58:18.708]  Do you disavow it?
[00:58:19.008 --> 00:58:19.708]  And they don't answer.
[00:58:19.728 --> 00:58:22.749]  Yeah, they said, they said, they said, Jack, you're making this stuff up.
[00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:24.950]  And I said, I provided the URLs.
[00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:26.050]  They're HTML links.
[00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:26.970]  It's all on the flyer.
[00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.811]  You tweeted it out.
[00:58:27.891 --> 00:58:28.591]  It's right there.
[00:58:29.636 --> 00:58:31.378]  Yep, you tweeted it out on the flyer.
[00:58:31.458 --> 00:58:33.159]  Wow, it's amazing, Jack Posobiec.
[00:58:33.239 --> 00:58:35.181]  It just keeps getting weirder and weirder.
[00:58:36.442 --> 00:58:37.683]  What's going to be next, Jack?
[00:58:37.724 --> 00:58:40.186]  What do you think the Democrats will align themselves with next?
[00:58:40.246 --> 00:58:41.207]  Radical Islam?
[00:58:41.547 --> 00:58:42.828]  Satanic porn sites?
[00:58:42.868 --> 00:58:44.450]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:45.851]  And will they disavow?
[00:58:45.991 --> 00:58:46.872]  I highly doubt it.
[00:58:46.972 --> 00:58:50.856]  It's almost like it's a race to the bottom of the barrel with the Democrat Party at this point, Owen.
[00:58:51.296 --> 00:58:54.199]  Well, we're going to continue to commentate on it and we're going to keep you updated.
[00:58:54.219 --> 00:58:55.040]  Thanks for joining us, Jack.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.002]  Thanks man.
[00:58:56.283 --> 00:58:57.789]  What's next from the Democrats folks?
[00:58:58.171 --> 00:58:59.295]  You won't believe it.
