[00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.518]  Welcome to the Infowars Nighly News.
[00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:21.919]  It's Wednesday, August 2nd, 2017.
[00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.360]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.501]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:43.991]  Tonight, President Donald Trump delivers another campaign promise as he takes a hard line on immigration with his proposal to slash the number of legal immigrants admitted to the U.S.
[00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:47.533]  and begin a merit-based immigration system.
[00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:58.197]  Meanwhile, CNN's Jim Acosta gets in the ring with Trump advisor Stephen Miller over the president's racist immigration policy.
[00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:03.059]  That is one of the most outrageous, insulting, ignorant, and foolish things you've ever said.
[00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.725]  All that plus the Pentagon says there's a good chance the U.S.
[00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:15.515]  military has been infiltrated by enemy combatants through the government's immigrant recruitment program.
[00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:20.241]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:35.358]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:47.404]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact
[00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:53.667]  That our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:02.310]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:11.815]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:18.804]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:27.317]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.041]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.904]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:43.532]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:44.332]  Thank you very much.
[00:02:44.472 --> 00:02:46.133]  It's great to be here today to unveil legislation
[00:03:13.117 --> 00:03:13.337]  Thank you.
[00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:35.673]  We're good to go.
[00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:11.441]  Green cards provide permanent residency, work authorization, and fast track to citizenship.
[00:04:12.222 --> 00:04:23.547]  For decades, the United States was operated, and has operated, a very low-skilled immigration system, issuing record numbers of green cards to low-wage immigrants.
[00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:30.070]  This policy has placed substantial pressure on American workers, taxpayers, and community resources.
[00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.812]  Among those hit the hardest in recent years have been immigrants,
[00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:39.795]  And very importantly, minority workers competing for jobs against brand new arrivals.
[00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:45.799]  And it has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:56.367]  The RAISE Act ends chain migration and replaces our low-skilled system with a new points-based system for receiving a green card.
[00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:08.355]  So there is President Trump introducing the RAISE Act to America today, fulfilling a campaign promise on immigration reform.
[00:05:08.855 --> 00:05:19.997]  Now, we will talk about the RAISE Act in an unbelievable press conference that took place after President Trump with Stephen Miller, who made a legend of himself today.
[00:05:20.418 --> 00:05:22.018]  But first, let's look at
[00:05:23.078 --> 00:05:25.559]  How the left is responding to the RAISE Act.
[00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.761]  So first, I went to a search engine known as Google.
[00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:33.722]  It's well known that Google manipulates its results.
[00:05:33.762 --> 00:05:45.005]  Now I want to show two things that are interesting to me about how the left has responded to President Trump's RAISE Act and his campaign promise fulfillment of immigration reform.
[00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:49.967]  If you plug immigration reform Trump into Google today, guys, pull that back up.
[00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:53.479]  Look at the first three top stories that come up.
[00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:56.880]  CNN, Washington Post, ABC News.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.241]  Shocking, right?
[00:05:58.421 --> 00:05:58.761]  I know.
[00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:01.202]  Now go down to the news stories that come up.
[00:06:01.242 --> 00:06:03.263]  Those Twitter stories that come up are customized.
[00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.363]  Now look at the news stories.
[00:06:04.403 --> 00:06:05.243]  Those are customized.
[00:06:05.604 --> 00:06:06.604]  Those are people we follow.
[00:06:06.924 --> 00:06:07.644]  Now look at the news.
[00:06:07.824 --> 00:06:08.985]  CNN, liberal.
[00:06:09.465 --> 00:06:10.766]  LA Times, liberal.
[00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:12.646]  Washington Post, liberal.
[00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:14.447]  ABC News, liberal.
[00:06:14.847 --> 00:06:15.428]  AOL!
[00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:16.108]  Liberal!
[00:06:16.468 --> 00:06:17.289]  NBC News!
[00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.969]  Liberal!
[00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.531]  Washington Examiner!
[00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:20.211]  Finally!
[00:06:20.371 --> 00:06:24.915]  Washington Examiner, I would not say, is a totally liberal shill publication.
[00:06:25.936 --> 00:06:33.839]  Look at that, no Fox, no Infowars, no Breitbart, nobody that you would consider staunchly conservative in that first page of responses.
[00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:47.503]  And we know that this is a clear agenda by Google to control the Overton window, to control search results, because that's the story every time you search any current news trend.
[00:06:47.964 --> 00:06:50.244]  You always get the liberal press first.
[00:06:50.364 --> 00:06:52.685]  We have documented this time and time again.
[00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:54.266]  Now I want to show you another
[00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.520]  I don't even know what you would call this.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.960]  Hypocrisy?
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:05.383]  Just how liberals try to rig their rhetoric in order to create a narrative.
[00:07:06.044 --> 00:07:12.346]  Let me just read to you, now these are all the headlines from all the liberal publications that Google had up first.
[00:07:12.586 --> 00:07:17.308]  CNN, Trump backs plan that would curb legal immigration.
[00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:19.469]  That phrase, legal immigration.
[00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.070]  Okay?
[00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.111]  Trump, it goes on.
[00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:29.146]  Trump pushes sharply to cut the number of legal immigrants to move to US.
[00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.909]  Again, you notice that phrase, legal immigrants.
[00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.991]  Washington Post.
[00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:38.918]  Trump GOP senators introduce bill to slash legal immigration levels.
[00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:42.143]  Again, that phrase, legal immigration.
[00:07:42.623 --> 00:07:48.925]  Trump pushes to limit legal immigration to high-skilled workers who speak English.
[00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:50.665]  Again, ABC News.
[00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:52.666]  Legal immigration.
[00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:53.706]  BBC.
[00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:57.967]  Trump backs proposal to curb legal immigration.
[00:07:59.108 --> 00:08:01.308]  So that's all you're seeing from all these liberal publications.
[00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:02.589]  Legal immigration.
[00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:03.489]  Legal immigration.
[00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:04.369]  Legal immigration.
[00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.731]  So there's only two types of immigration that liberal media will cover.
[00:08:10.694 --> 00:08:16.842]  There's legal immigration that we see they're covering today with Trump's new immigration reform.
[00:08:17.382 --> 00:08:18.884]  And then there's just immigration!
[00:08:19.758 --> 00:08:23.381]  There is no illegal immigration, according to a liberal publication.
[00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:27.324]  There is no illegal immigration, according to any of these stories.
[00:08:28.224 --> 00:08:29.405]  Isn't it amazing, folks?
[00:08:30.106 --> 00:08:35.770]  Trump addresses illegal immigration, non-citizens, and they won't say illegal.
[00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.351]  They will never use that phrase.
[00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:38.832]  They will never use that rhetoric.
[00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:44.076]  Then Trump addresses legal immigration, and that's all they can say.
[00:08:44.316 --> 00:08:45.177]  Legal immigration.
[00:08:45.297 --> 00:08:46.038]  Legal immigration.
[00:08:46.678 --> 00:08:47.999]  This is the difference, folks.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:58.568]  This is how liberal media controls their rhetoric and tries to control the narrative by just eliminating words from their vocabulary, like legal immigration.
[00:08:58.608 --> 00:09:09.098]  Now, let's get to Stephen Miller, a top advisor to Trump on policy, who made himself a legend today, beginning with an absolute roast of New York Times' Glenn Thrush.
[00:09:10.058 --> 00:09:11.560]  Alright, let's go to Glenn.
[00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:13.429]  Two quick questions.
[00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:14.249]  Look at the smile.
[00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:15.049]  He knew it was coming.
[00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.890]  He knew the roast was coming.
[00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.810]  I have some statistics.
[00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:24.471]  There have been a lot of studies out there that don't show a correlation between low-skilled immigration and the loss of jobs for native workers.
[00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:32.773]  Cite for me, if you could, one or two studies with specific numbers that prove the correlation between those two things, because your entire policy is based on that.
[00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:40.474]  And secondly, I have sources that told me about a month ago that you guys have sort of elbowed infrastructure out of the way to get immigration
[00:09:42.555 --> 00:09:45.396]  There's Glenn Thrush from the New York Times.
[00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:46.536]  The latter statement isn't true.
[00:09:46.556 --> 00:09:53.859]  I think the most recent study I would point to is the study from George Borjas that he just did about the Mariel Boatlift.
[00:09:54.439 --> 00:10:02.082]  And he went back and reexamined and opened up the old data and talked about how it actually did reduce wages for workers who were living there at the time.
[00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:11.030]  So he addresses Glenn Thrush being wrong on one of his talking points, and then he actually answers the question, citing a study.
[00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.171]  But that's not enough of Thrush.
[00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:35.775]  At the end of the day, why do special interests want to bring in Willis-Gilliland?
[00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.757]  I'm not asking for common sense!
[00:10:37.817 --> 00:10:38.558]  Glenn Thrush!
[00:10:38.718 --> 00:10:41.861]  And then Steve Miller says, yeah, it's clear you don't want common sense, you work for the New York Times.
[00:10:41.921 --> 00:10:45.305]  Glenn Thrush even says it, I'm not asking for common sense, folks.
[00:10:45.606 --> 00:10:48.369]  That is the liberals admitting their own thought process.
[00:10:48.909 --> 00:10:50.730]  Go ahead with him.
[00:10:51.310 --> 00:11:01.616]  Glenn, maybe we'll make a carve-out in the bill that says the New York Times can hire all the low-skilled, less-paid workers they want from other countries and see how you feel then about low-wage substitution.
[00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:03.857]  This is a reality that's happening in our country.
[00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:07.499]  Maybe it's time we had compassion, Glenn, for American workers.
[00:11:07.739 --> 00:11:12.142]  President Trump has met with American workers who have been replaced by foreign workers.
[00:11:14.403 --> 00:11:19.006]  So okay, so there's Glenn Thrush who just got absolutely roasted by Stephen Miller.
[00:11:19.306 --> 00:11:22.149]  Completely destroyed and made to look like an idiot.
[00:11:22.229 --> 00:11:24.170]  And then Stephen Miller, there he is, the hero.
[00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.913]  And then Stephen Miller gets Glenn Thrush to admit that he doesn't want common sense.
[00:11:28.133 --> 00:11:28.493]  Wow.
[00:11:29.434 --> 00:11:30.474]  Stephen Miller, amazing.
[00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:31.835]  But then it got better.
[00:11:32.396 --> 00:11:35.938]  Jim Acosta decided to open his big fat mouth.
[00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:36.539]  Go ahead with Jim.
[00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:43.702]  What you're proposing, or what the President's proposing here, does not sound like it's in keeping with American tradition when it comes to immigration.
[00:11:43.782 --> 00:11:52.666]  Jim Acosta is just a blubbering fool who thinks he can be taken seriously because he wears a jacket, a tie, and gels his hair.
[00:11:54.151 --> 00:11:55.471]  He's a nothing without his hair gel.
[00:11:55.952 --> 00:12:00.295]  Aren't you trying to change what it means to be an immigrant coming into this country?
[00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:03.817]  If you're telling them you have to speak English?
[00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:05.678]  Can't people learn how to speak English?
[00:12:05.698 --> 00:12:06.879]  Oh, this is so legendary, folks.
[00:12:06.939 --> 00:12:12.103]  Well, first of all, right now, it's a requirement that to be naturalized, you have to speak English.
[00:12:12.123 --> 00:12:16.966]  So the notion that speaking English wouldn't be a part of immigration systems would be actually very ahistorical.
[00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:24.288]  Secondly, I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of liberty and lighting the world.
[00:12:24.308 --> 00:12:26.669]  It's a symbol of American liberty, lighting the world.
[00:12:26.989 --> 00:12:33.231]  The poem that you're referring to, that was added later, is not actually part of the original Statue of Liberty, but we're plundering the world.
[00:12:33.271 --> 00:12:39.813]  More fundamentally, I'm saying that that does not represent what the country has always thought of as the notion of liberty.
[00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:41.154]  But Jim, he just got embarrassed.
[00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:42.654]  The blubbering idiot just got embarrassed.
[00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:44.475]  He hasn't had enough though, so he chimes back in.
[00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:47.317]  That sounds like some National Park revisionism.
[00:12:47.637 --> 00:12:47.817]  No.
[00:12:47.857 --> 00:12:55.762]  The Statue of Liberty has always been a beacon of hope to the world for people to send their people to this country.
[00:12:56.003 --> 00:12:57.984]  And they're not always going to speak English, Stephen.
[00:12:58.004 --> 00:12:59.905]  They're not always going to be highly skilled.
[00:12:59.925 --> 00:13:03.127]  They're not always going to be somebody who speaks English.
[00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:07.470]  In 1970 when we let in 300,000 people, violating or not violating the Statue of Liberty law of the land.
[00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:24.177]  In the 1990s... So now here's Stephen Miller again showing how much smarter he is than these liberal reporters by stating facts and history.
[00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:35.919]  And Jim Acosta and Glenn Thresher like... Tell me what years meet Jim Acosta's definition of the Statue of Liberty poem, Law of the Land.
[00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:39.740]  So you're saying a million a year is the Statue of Liberty number.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.080]  900,000 violates it, 800,000 violates it.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:49.344]  You're sort of bringing a press one for English philosophy here to immigration, and that's never been what the United States has been about.
[00:13:49.664 --> 00:13:53.886]  But your statement's also shockingly ahistorical in another respect, too.
[00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:57.588]  Which is, if you look at the history of immigration, it's actually ebbed and flowed.
[00:13:57.848 --> 00:14:00.750]  We've had periods of very large... No, don't show a liberal history!
[00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:05.092]  ...immigration and more immigration, and during the... We're in a period of immigration right now.
[00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:09.695]  If you show a liberal history, their entire paradigm is shattered.
[00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:10.455]  This is so great!
[00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:10.615]  Jim.
[00:14:10.696 --> 00:14:10.836]  Jim.
[00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:11.016]  Jim.
[00:14:11.056 --> 00:14:12.757]  I want to be serious, Jim.
[00:14:12.797 --> 00:14:16.579]  Do you really, at CNN, not know the difference between green card policy and illegal immigration?
[00:14:16.599 --> 00:14:17.860]  I mean, you really don't know that?
[00:14:35.072 --> 00:14:37.355]  This is the greatest roast in media history.
[00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:42.663]  And Acosta keeps giving him more ammo!
[00:14:42.783 --> 00:14:44.766]  He keeps getting back in the ring!
[00:14:44.906 --> 00:14:46.449]  This is the point right here, look, he closes his eyes.
[00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:49.173]  This is when you know the Liberal's defeated, when they close their eyes and start talking.
[00:14:50.174 --> 00:14:50.495]  I am shocked
[00:15:10.834 --> 00:15:11.215]  There it is!
[00:15:11.335 --> 00:15:12.356]  This is so good!
[00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:37.656]  That you think only people from Great Britain or Australia would speak English is so insulting to millions of hard-working immigrants who do speak English from all over the world.
[00:15:38.996 --> 00:15:45.537]  Jim, have you honestly never met an immigrant from another country who speaks English outside of Great Britain and Australia?
[00:15:45.877 --> 00:15:48.338]  Is that your personal experience?
[00:15:48.518 --> 00:15:49.598]  But that's not what you said!
[00:15:49.798 --> 00:15:52.099]  And it shows your cosmopolitan bias.
[00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:53.179]  And I just want to say...
[00:15:54.219 --> 00:16:01.303]  ...engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into this country... That's what they're doing, that's what the liberals do.
[00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:11.749]  ...ignorant and foolish things you've ever said and for you that's still a really... the notion that you think that this is a racist film is so wrong and so insulting.
[00:16:12.109 --> 00:16:18.393]  Jim, the reality is is that the foreign-born population into our country has quadrupled since 1970.
[00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:21.995]  This is the most legendary media roast of all time.
[00:16:22.817 --> 00:16:24.058]  Jim Acosta, man.
[00:16:24.078 --> 00:16:24.358]  Poor guy.
[00:16:24.398 --> 00:16:25.959]  They just keep sending them out there.
[00:16:25.979 --> 00:16:27.960]  Oh, now this is an interesting twist here.
[00:16:43.328 --> 00:16:45.108]  What policy am I advocating?
[00:16:45.168 --> 00:16:45.788]  He doesn't even know.
[00:16:45.848 --> 00:16:46.749]  Acosta doesn't even know.
[00:16:46.789 --> 00:16:48.709]  He's like, what policy am I advocating?
[00:16:48.889 --> 00:17:03.251]  The people that hurt the most by the policy that you're advocating are immigrant workers and minority workers and African-American workers and Hispanic workers.
[00:17:04.012 --> 00:17:06.792]  So now this lady who appears to be a liberal starts attacking him.
[00:17:06.972 --> 00:17:08.312]  Whoa, you keep saying African-Americans.
[00:17:08.332 --> 00:17:09.393]  You keep saying African-Americans.
[00:17:09.553 --> 00:17:11.853]  And then he turns that on its head and won this battle.
[00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.990]  I'm not trying to be funny, but you keep saying this.
[00:17:30.879 --> 00:17:35.102]  See, only liberals are allowed to virtue signal for the African-American population.
[00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:35.803]  Don't you understand?
[00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:39.505]  Only liberals can be fighting for the rights of black people.
[00:17:39.866 --> 00:17:41.227]  Stephen Miller's not allowed to do that.
[00:17:41.307 --> 00:17:43.528]  See, that's why that liberal reporter had to chime in.
[00:17:43.588 --> 00:17:44.069]  How dare he?
[00:17:44.269 --> 00:17:48.352]  And then he spun it on its head and said, wait a second, we're trying to help African-American workers.
[00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:59.030]  We're already living here by having standards, by having a real clear requirement that you be able to support yourself financially, by making sure that employers can pay a living wage.
[00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:04.575]  That's the right policy for our country, and it's the President's commitment to taking care of American workers.
[00:18:04.915 --> 00:18:09.799]  I apologize, Jim, if things got heated, but you did make some pretty rough insinuations.
[00:18:10.546 --> 00:18:15.272]  Yes, that is one of the most legendary media roasts of all time.
[00:18:15.352 --> 00:18:18.897]  And of course, it's again, Jim Acosta.
[00:18:19.297 --> 00:18:27.948]  You know, after Trump roasted him to the point of like completely overbaked, like just a completely dried out turkey or something, I thought, you know,
[00:18:28.889 --> 00:18:30.349]  I kind of felt bad for Jim Acosta.
[00:18:30.369 --> 00:18:31.890]  I thought, you know, here's Jim Acosta.
[00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:37.511]  I hope CNN pays him well to go out there and be an agitator, to be a gnat in Trump's ear.
[00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:39.171]  He obviously knows his role.
[00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:40.372]  I hope CNN pays him well.
[00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:48.794]  Then you see that argument and that debate with Stephen Miller and you say, wow, Jim Acosta really is a complete fool.
[00:18:49.594 --> 00:18:52.135]  Jim Acosta really is a complete blubbering moron.
[00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:55.035]  So, Stephen Miller, huge props, man.
[00:18:55.095 --> 00:18:57.256]  You just became a legend with that media roast today.
[00:18:57.296 --> 00:18:58.156]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:05.325 --> 00:23:08.946]  I'm now joined by the founder of UnderstandingTheThreat.com.
[00:23:08.966 --> 00:23:10.707]  This is John Guandolo.
[00:23:11.067 --> 00:23:24.732]  He is also a counterterrorism expert, a former FBI agent, a former Marine Corps officer, and he knows what he's talking about when it comes to the military and when it comes to what the threat is domestically in the military.
[00:23:24.792 --> 00:23:26.133]  John, thank you so much for joining me today.
[00:23:27.025 --> 00:23:27.946]  Well, thanks for having me.
[00:23:27.986 --> 00:23:28.647]  I appreciate it.
[00:23:42.202 --> 00:23:43.802]  John, you're an expert on all of this.
[00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.623]  I'm sure that you were not surprised by this.
[00:23:46.003 --> 00:23:47.803]  In fact, you probably even felt you broke this story a while ago.
[00:24:11.522 --> 00:24:16.485]  Yes, this is just one piece of a much larger problem.
[00:24:17.066 --> 00:24:19.467]  So, this is the penetration of the DoD.
[00:24:20.828 --> 00:24:36.458]  One thing I'll say is, as an FBI agent, I did investigations into penetration of the Muslim chaplain program and the Arab linguist and Pashto linguist programs, both from contract linguists, as well as uniformed, meaning
[00:24:37.325 --> 00:24:48.493]  Uh, on duty, active duty military personnel who were utilized as translators for a number of languages that we needed in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere.
[00:24:48.933 --> 00:24:51.815]  And we found that there was a significant problem.
[00:24:52.195 --> 00:24:58.980]  This problem bled over also into role players being used on military bases and other places.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.121]  And these issues
[00:25:01.174 --> 00:25:03.875]  10, 12 years later have still not been addressed.
[00:25:04.355 --> 00:25:08.176]  And somehow our leaders seem to think if we just ignore it, it'll go away.
[00:25:08.196 --> 00:25:09.677]  And it's getting much, much worse.
[00:25:10.077 --> 00:25:23.901]  And again, I just want to emphasize something that understanding the threat and that I have been saying for a long time, this entire war is much more a counterintelligence and espionage matter than it is simply terrorism.
[00:25:25.646 --> 00:25:31.870]  Well, and just to be clear, this was a program that was created in the final weeks of the Bush-Cheney administration.
[00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:46.338]  It was then launched under President Barack Obama, and Representative Steve Russell, a Republican from Oklahoma, has said the program has been replete with problems to include foreign infiltration.
[00:25:46.758 --> 00:25:48.159]  That's what John is talking about.
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:26:08.152]  They are actually, it looks like, starting to draw more attention to this finally, John, as apparently, according to this lawsuit that we'll get to in a second, they've started to ratchet back some of the clearances that these enrollees in this program are getting that's resulted in a lawsuit.
[00:26:08.773 --> 00:26:13.036]  But now it's gone even further, I think, with more sanctions against this program now.
[00:26:14.156 --> 00:26:16.038]  But it's just amazing to me to think
[00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:19.145]  I mean, this should be a much bigger story to me.
[00:26:19.185 --> 00:26:21.608]  I mean, I don't really hear too many people talking about this.
[00:26:22.969 --> 00:26:32.060]  Right, and this really, what you're doing by sharing this and uncovering this, is you're opening the door to the bigger problem.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.123]  And the bigger problem, I believe, is not
[00:26:34.904 --> 00:26:46.456]  The penetration of our government and of our society, because it's not just the Islamic movement from a counterintelligence perspective that has penetrated our security services, our government.
[00:26:48.298 --> 00:26:55.145]  The bigger issues, I believe, is that the United States government does not have a functional
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:07.230]  Counterintelligence apparatus, number one, to deal with this and the larger issues, the counterintelligence penetrations from China and Russia and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.
[00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:11.094]  You can be a leader in the U.S.
[00:27:11.174 --> 00:27:16.038]  Muslim Brotherhood and that is not a disqualifier, for instance, for a top secret clearance.
[00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:25.802]  There are all kinds of issues and this is a great vehicle to expose those and many other issues.
[00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:32.394]  No, that's actually amazing because, again, it's those clearances that they're starting to ratchet back that's led to a lawsuit.
[00:27:32.594 --> 00:27:33.435]  We're going to get to that.
[00:27:34.356 --> 00:27:46.988]  Another lawmaker told Fox News that the program has been compromised and that the Department of Defense officials have not presented answers to his questions about missing enrollees, such as where are they?
[00:27:47.448 --> 00:27:48.269]  What do they know?
[00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:49.490]  Where are they serving?
[00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:50.371]  What are their numbers?
[00:27:50.931 --> 00:27:54.475]  How can you possibly have missing members of the military?
[00:27:54.515 --> 00:28:00.562]  I mean, isn't there, I mean, there has to be some other law that you're breaking when you're just a missing enrollee of a military program.
[00:28:01.823 --> 00:28:09.245]  Well, you're certainly in violation of the UCMJ, the military's, you know, code of justice that we utilize.
[00:28:09.766 --> 00:28:14.127]  And you're definitely, if you're AWOL, that's an imprisonable offense.
[00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:17.788]  So somebody ought to know where they are, depending on what unit they're attached to.
[00:28:18.749 --> 00:28:21.970]  But this, again, it is really a cluster.
[00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.631]  This is just, it's what you've done here.
[00:28:26.031 --> 00:28:29.092]  You're shining the light on one example.
[00:28:30.134 --> 00:28:59.786]  Of a much broader issue and I think that's that's the problem is it's a lack of real counterintelligence efforts by the United States government and it is a fundamental lack of understanding of how to vet specifically and I'm talking about Muslims who are likely jihadis because what we've seen across the board is when you open up a door the people that get in line a lot of the times we've seen it in
[00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:07.688]  FBI hiring practices, which are horribly rife with people who are trying to get in.
[00:29:07.808 --> 00:29:08.429]  CIA.
[00:29:08.449 --> 00:29:15.575]  I mean, look, the FBI and the CIA should not be hiring people online and allowing people to apply online.
[00:29:15.995 --> 00:29:17.977]  It just opens the door to all kinds of things.
[00:29:18.297 --> 00:29:20.739]  And because their vetting processes are broken,
[00:29:21.778 --> 00:29:24.719]  For instance, as I mentioned, being a leader in the U.S.
[00:29:24.739 --> 00:29:29.100]  Muslim Brotherhood here is not a disqualifier for getting hired.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.901]  I mean, it's outrageous.
[00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:32.041]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[00:29:32.621 --> 00:29:41.824]  There are all kinds of issues that what you're doing here, which I really thank you for, you're opening up a much bigger door to much bigger issues.
[00:29:42.405 --> 00:29:43.545]  Well, and let's be clear, too.
[00:29:43.565 --> 00:29:46.106]  I mean, this is just a common sense factor.
[00:29:46.226 --> 00:29:46.506]  Okay.
[00:29:47.714 --> 00:30:09.850]  Yes, let's have a military program where we invite people from other countries who want to become citizens, who maybe are here and they're having trouble getting a green card or something, and we say, okay, serve in our military and we can make this process faster, we can get you a green card, we can make you a naturalized citizen, and we've actually had a lot of great soldiers come out as a part of this program.
[00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:12.532]  So this isn't a knock on this program.
[00:30:12.873 --> 00:30:14.874]  This is a knock on the lack of common sense.
[00:30:16.095 --> 00:30:28.800]  Taking a program and wondering, wait a second, we've bombed 14 countries in this region of the planet, in the Middle East, and we're not even going to have a specific vetting program on people trying to come into our military, come into our country?
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:37.584]  I mean, that's just common sense stuff that they don't even want to engage in because of political correctness, I guess is my assessment of that.
[00:30:37.984 --> 00:30:40.045]  But then you also have in this story that's breaking,
[00:30:42.446 --> 00:30:51.432]  Apparently the lack of vetting at MAVNI led to a backlog that led to enrollment of many soldiers prior to completion of their background checks.
[00:30:51.452 --> 00:30:53.093]  That's exactly what John just said.
[00:30:53.374 --> 00:30:54.094]  He already knew it.
[00:30:54.514 --> 00:31:08.464]  Sources also told Fox that some of the countries of origin for MAVNI enrollees are of concern, but as of yet there is no evidence to the public domain that it's ISIS, Al-Qaeda, or any other terrorist groups.
[00:31:09.625 --> 00:31:10.926]  Okay, yeah, not yet.
[00:31:11.126 --> 00:31:16.711]  That's just like, not yet, the guy that ran over people on the London Bridge, shouted Allahu Akbar.
[00:31:17.152 --> 00:31:24.458]  And then I believe it was Secretary John Kelly double-checked me on this, guys, who said, if you knew what I knew about
[00:31:26.934 --> 00:31:41.217]  National defense about national security about infiltrated People terrorists infiltrating in this country you wouldn't even go outside So you've got all of this going on and as you said this has been an issue.
[00:31:41.257 --> 00:31:54.160]  That's just been growing Yeah, I mean I cannot overemphasize to your audience that this entire war from 9-11 to today primarily
[00:31:54.975 --> 00:31:58.856]  Is an information war from a from a military standpoint.
[00:31:58.896 --> 00:32:00.537]  We call this information warfare.
[00:32:01.017 --> 00:32:02.017]  It's propaganda.
[00:32:02.398 --> 00:32:03.558]  It's counterintelligence.
[00:32:03.958 --> 00:32:05.058]  It's espionage.
[00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:10.840]  It's all the political warfare and insinuation.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.081]  Well, John, let me ask you this.
[00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:19.823]  I mean, they say they say that there's no knowledge of ISIS or Al Qaeda, but that there are countries of concern where these enrollees are coming from.
[00:32:20.183 --> 00:32:22.004]  OK, what other countries of concern are there?
[00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:24.427]  I mean, what are these countries?
[00:32:40.501 --> 00:32:44.587]  The people that the military and but just let me just say the U.S.
[00:32:44.647 --> 00:32:45.889]  government and the U.S.
[00:32:46.329 --> 00:32:56.264]  media have held up as leaders as representative and I'm just going to look at the Muslim community because this is the jihadi terrorist threat.

[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.

[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.

[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:57.748]  Yes, when I was recruited out of the FBI to work for the Department of Defense, the work we were doing was defunded.
[00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:17.167]  By the Obama administration.
[00:37:17.627 --> 00:37:25.513]  And it's quite frankly because we were so effective and we were so on target with what we were talking about and a lot of the work we did.
[00:37:25.994 --> 00:37:27.335]  Let me be very clear.
[00:37:28.175 --> 00:37:33.199]  The Islamic movement in the United States has a significant intelligence apparatus here.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.823]  And we not only know that, from my experiences,
[00:37:38.963 --> 00:38:02.559]  We know that from documents that were recovered in FBI raids here in the United States, where Muslim Brotherhood internal documents revealed that they have an intelligence apparatus here and that intelligence collection and influence operations is a significant part of what they do here in the United States.
[00:38:02.899 --> 00:38:05.341]  And I will tell you, everywhere we went,
[00:38:07.807 --> 00:38:08.427]  That was amazing.
[00:38:08.467 --> 00:38:18.835]  We would do VIP briefings on Capitol Hill where members of Congress would host myself and my colleague and we would have other members of Congress, retired generals.
[00:38:19.235 --> 00:38:27.641]  Sometimes we had retired national security advisors to the president and we would brief them and because of their intelligence
[00:38:28.786 --> 00:38:44.931]  System up on the hill they would know we were coming and they would schedule a briefing at the exact same time with a senior Muslim Brotherhood leader either inside the Capitol or adjacent to the Capitol at the exact same time and invite members and their staffs to come.
[00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:57.055]  That is how significant their intelligence is at that level and the what Chris Gobbett's related to you is what
[00:38:58.498 --> 00:39:23.986]  Congresswoman Sue Myrick warned about Muslim Brotherhood putting Muslims inside committees and inside certain places in the government to collect intelligence and influence those committees and those places they were in the government is exactly what we're seeing with this Imran Awan right now, the case going down right now.
[00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:41.644]  Yeah, and you start to talk about defense contractors, you start to talk about tech contractors, you're talking about people now that can get in through the private sector, and Awan is the perfect example of that, and he's being looked into right now, and it always seems to be
[00:39:43.803 --> 00:39:52.307]  It's going to be bank fraud, it looks like, that is going to be the thing that brings this guy in, and who knows what else they find out, but that's the exact type of infiltration we're talking about.
[00:39:52.987 --> 00:40:04.453]  Not just inside the military, potentially, inside the government, but also, you've got to talk about these people who bring in people from the private sector with defense contractors, tech contractors, etc., etc.
[00:40:04.813 --> 00:40:06.194]  So, John, I want to close out with this.
[00:40:06.894 --> 00:40:07.994]  We've addressed the issue.
[00:40:08.354 --> 00:40:14.036]  Obviously, understandingthethreat.com, you can find more information there to everything John is talking about.
[00:40:14.576 --> 00:40:15.596]  What do you think is the move?
[00:40:15.636 --> 00:40:18.177]  What is the proper move for the government right now?
[00:40:18.297 --> 00:40:19.417]  Who needs to act?
[00:40:19.477 --> 00:40:23.538]  Is it the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the NSA?
[00:40:24.699 --> 00:40:30.640]  What actions do you think need to be taken to start ratcheting the espionage against this country back?
[00:40:34.057 --> 00:40:35.118]  That's a big question.
[00:40:35.318 --> 00:40:37.219]  Let me answer it kind of on the top end.
[00:40:37.279 --> 00:40:45.044]  We put out, after the election and before the inauguration, a 14-point recommendation to the President.
[00:40:45.304 --> 00:40:54.751]  And at the time, I had been invited to meet with him up in New York about a whole host of issues.
[00:40:55.471 --> 00:40:59.874]  I was unable, because I was actually training people at the time,
[00:41:01.149 --> 00:41:17.794]  But what we recommended, one of the big things is we have got to, until you have the ability to vet people coming into the country, allowing people to come into the country, quite frankly, from anywhere is a dangerous and unprofessional response.
[00:41:18.354 --> 00:41:27.177]  And our recommendation was you need to shut down all immigration until you do a top to bottom review of your immigration procedures,
[00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:33.331]  And your hiring and vetting practices into the national security realm, number one.
[00:41:33.851 --> 00:41:45.654]  Number two, your CIA, FBI, DIA, name the agency at the federal level, are completely unaware of the threat and how the threat operates.
[00:41:45.754 --> 00:41:48.655]  And the evidence of that is when we do our three-day
[00:41:53.169 --> 00:42:18.848]  100% of the law enforcement officials in the room at the federal, state, and local level, including FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force officials, have said every time, we did not understand this, we didn't know this information that you're putting out about how they use Sharia, what the network is, how the network operates, we didn't know it, and we believe it's critical to protecting our local communities.
[00:42:19.669 --> 00:42:20.749]  That is the reality.
[00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:21.270]  So,
[00:42:22.702 --> 00:42:40.419]  Number one, when you mention treason, what I would say is people in national security positions who do not know this information are unprofessional at the job that they are supposed to be doing to protect the United States and therefore should be let go.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.023]  Number two, a significant training program
[00:42:44.875 --> 00:43:04.476]  Needs to be our training program needs to be utilized to train the leaders and the people inside the government that are supposed to be doing these jobs because they can't do their jobs if they don't know the very information that you and I are talking about and how these entities and individuals are penetrating our system.
[00:43:05.675 --> 00:43:11.577]  And quite frankly, number three, the Muslim Brotherhood has got to be dealt with.
[00:43:11.977 --> 00:43:34.783]  We have, from the Holy Land Foundation trial, which was adjudicated in Dallas in 2008, revealed that all of the prominent Islamic organizations in the United States, and let me be very specific, the Islamic Society of North America, the Muslim Student Association, the Islamic Circle of North America, the North American Islamic Trust, the Council on American Islamic Relations,
[00:43:35.223 --> 00:43:46.406]  And others are a part of the Muslim Brotherhood's movement, whose stated objective is to overthrow the government and replace it with an Islamic state in violation of federal law.
[00:43:46.946 --> 00:44:04.831]  And in the case of the Islamic Society of North America, the North American Islamic Trust, the Department of Justice found that they're directly funding the terrorist group Hamas, and that the Council on American Islamic Relations, in fact, is a Hamas entity, which is a terrorist group and should be shut down and prosecuted.
[00:44:05.535 --> 00:44:11.937]  That can all be done today by the Department of Justice because the evidence already exists to do so.
[00:44:12.557 --> 00:44:31.244]  And then the President can designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, which he should do today, and begin ripping these people out of the community and shutting their organizations down, putting their leaders in jail, and seizing their assets here in the United States.
[00:44:31.664 --> 00:44:32.565]  That would go a long way
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.082]  Those three things to turn this around.
[00:44:37.422 --> 00:44:42.546]  But you've got to put counterintelligence professionals in positions.
[00:44:43.107 --> 00:44:49.551]  I'm telling you, the Central Intelligence Agency is not functional from a counterintelligence perspective.
[00:44:49.912 --> 00:44:53.234]  They don't do the job that they were created to do.
[00:44:54.755 --> 00:45:02.141]  Covert operations, non-official cover operations is something that our CIA is not doing.
[00:45:02.822 --> 00:45:07.466]  And the counterintelligence apparatus in the FBI is unaware of many of these things.
[00:45:07.806 --> 00:45:20.197]  You may have a few individuals still remaining in those organizations that know what they're doing, but as an organization, counterintelligence is simply not a part of day-to-day life.
[00:45:20.857 --> 00:45:28.964]  And it's really dangerous, not only for the United States generally, but for the American people specifically.
[00:45:30.011 --> 00:45:33.294]  And of course you have John Brennan, who is now a, well, hobbyist.
[00:45:33.734 --> 00:45:37.817]  And it all sounds very radical, what John just laid out, but that's the real deal, folks.
[00:45:37.857 --> 00:45:39.078]  That is real talk.
[00:45:39.538 --> 00:45:42.601]  And I couldn't agree with you more about the actions that could be taken.
[00:45:42.641 --> 00:45:47.184]  It could happen in one day, and it could drastically change national security here.
[00:45:48.485 --> 00:45:56.390]  One of the least radical things you said actually, which most liberals would throw their arms in the air about, is stopping immigrants from coming in.
[00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.191]  This is something that's actually not that radical.
[00:45:58.232 --> 00:46:01.574]  It's been done before in times of war, times of great national security.
[00:46:02.254 --> 00:46:09.959]  But today, Trump did announce some immigration reform, and now we're only bringing in their best and brightest, people that come here with skilled jobs.
[00:46:09.999 --> 00:46:10.800]  That's just another issue.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.481]  John, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:46:13.721 --> 00:46:16.562]  John Guandolo, he just laid it all out for us.
[00:46:17.262 --> 00:46:19.103]  UnderstandingTheThreat.com.
[00:46:19.583 --> 00:46:22.184]  And just keep your nose to the grindstone on this, John.
[00:46:22.204 --> 00:46:23.625]  I know that we've got a lot to talk about.
[00:46:23.665 --> 00:46:26.506]  Maybe we'll have you back on to talk about what develops with AWAN.
[00:46:27.186 --> 00:46:31.728]  But thank you for joining us and keep us updated on everything that UnderstandingTheThreat.com is doing.
[00:46:32.528 --> 00:46:33.629]  Thank you very much for having me.
[00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:45.848]  That is John Guandolo, UnderstandingTheThreat.com, and folks, visit that website, see what's going on, and it won't sound so radical what we're talking about when you can see the proof for yourself.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.742 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.814]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.894 --> 00:48:20.055]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.215 --> 00:48:25.118]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nacinidine X2.
[00:48:25.318 --> 00:48:30.301]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.481 --> 00:48:34.043]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.363 --> 00:48:37.324]  Still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.364 --> 00:48:38.624]  It's a key building block of the body.
[00:48:38.744 --> 00:48:45.667]  And if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.787 --> 00:48:48.427]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.447 --> 00:48:49.468]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.808 --> 00:48:50.508]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.548 --> 00:48:51.148]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:59.071]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield, nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.091 --> 00:49:00.011]  We can answer your questions, 888-253-3139.

[00:49:07.534 --> 00:49:08.475]  All the facts!
[00:49:08.535 --> 00:49:09.296]  Their own documents!
[00:49:09.657 --> 00:49:10.097]  All of it!
[00:49:10.718 --> 00:49:16.103]  All of it right here in this... The New World Order ain't coming, it's here!
[00:49:16.183 --> 00:49:17.425]  The Redcoats ain't coming, they're here!
[00:49:21.812 --> 00:49:24.573]  Yeah, enough of these people.
[00:49:25.234 --> 00:49:33.537]  They're a bunch of Christian murderers, girl, that run giant death factories, keeping babies alive, selling their body parts.
[00:49:33.597 --> 00:49:36.359]  What more do you want to know about these people?
[00:49:36.879 --> 00:49:39.320]  I go out and face these, girl.
[00:49:40.321 --> 00:49:42.762]  They literally crawl out from under rocks.
[00:49:43.142 --> 00:49:45.163]  They have green looking skin.
[00:49:45.183 --> 00:49:49.245]  They run around screaming, we love Satan, we want to eat baby.
[00:49:52.077 --> 00:49:53.458]  I have them on video.
[00:49:53.578 --> 00:50:00.302]  Here is in the creepy weird sick stuff man.
[00:50:00.782 --> 00:50:02.043]  Sick stuff man.
[00:50:02.083 --> 00:50:09.868]  She sleeps in the same room with a creepy little woman whose mother wears a hood over her head.
[00:50:09.888 --> 00:50:14.290]  While her number one is ugly.
[00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:18.493]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[00:50:19.947 --> 00:50:21.368]  I'm primitive.
[00:50:21.508 --> 00:50:23.950]  I'm real.
[00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.332]  I know the enemy.
[00:50:26.412 --> 00:50:29.014]  It's Alvaro the Globalist.
[00:50:48.885 --> 00:50:57.789]  You know, one of the great things about putting out contests like the one we're currently engaged in right now is that you get people from all walks of life competing in it.
[00:50:57.889 --> 00:51:05.713]  Some amateur and professional, like you just saw the excerpt from JB Patterson of JB and the Moonshine Band.
[00:51:05.753 --> 00:51:08.094]  He's a working musician who lives in Texas.
[00:51:08.134 --> 00:51:11.535]  In fact, he's going to have a gig this weekend in Bastrop, Texas, if anybody's around.
[00:51:11.955 --> 00:51:17.378]  But I thought his video is definitely in the running for our grand prize of the best cover
[00:51:18.198 --> 00:51:20.860]  You can see the high quality in the video and in the audio.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.782]  So now we turn to JB Patterson.
[00:51:22.802 --> 00:51:23.422]  How are you doing, sir?
[00:51:24.203 --> 00:51:24.743]  Good, Rob.
[00:51:24.763 --> 00:51:25.384]  How are you doing?
[00:51:25.784 --> 00:51:26.584]  I'm doing great.
[00:51:26.644 --> 00:51:33.850]  So what was your first thought when you heard about this contest and did you automatically know how you were going to play it or how did you come up with your style?
[00:51:35.651 --> 00:51:40.955]  Well, you know, I heard the song, you know, when it first aired and you guys brought it to everybody's attention.
[00:51:41.949 --> 00:51:43.490]  And I had been jamming.
[00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.891]  I was like, this is my new jam.
[00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:47.412]  I'd really just legitimately been listening to it.
[00:51:47.472 --> 00:51:48.593]  I thought it was pretty amazing.
[00:51:49.514 --> 00:51:53.816]  And I was, you know, joking around with my band and stuff and singing it and showing it to them.
[00:51:53.896 --> 00:52:06.064]  And then this contest popped up and I was like, I'm going to make one, you know, not really knowing what will come of it, but I just want to do it just for the sake of doing it because it's kind of my jam.
[00:52:07.618 --> 00:52:15.362]  What happened very organically at the office, we saw some other people who were doing cover versions of it, and I turned to Alex and said, we've got to do a contest.
[00:52:15.402 --> 00:52:18.704]  We've just gotten done doing our CNN is ISIS contest.
[00:52:19.524 --> 00:52:26.288]  And sometimes we get in these areas of time where we're just like, oh, we're going to do two or three contests in a row.
[00:52:26.688 --> 00:52:29.169]  So it just seemed like the right time, the right elements.
[00:52:29.229 --> 00:52:31.150]  And let me tell you, I've been getting some amazing entries.
[00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:36.333]  I have this Urban R&B entry that just came in this morning, where the guy's on autotune.
[00:52:37.233 --> 00:52:41.576]  It just, it changes the whole dynamic of the song into something that you would hear at a dance club.
[00:52:41.877 --> 00:52:46.720]  You know, where yours, you'd be more like in a roadhouse drinking beer with sawdust on the floor.
[00:52:47.121 --> 00:52:49.443]  So it's really interesting to see all these different styles.
[00:52:50.063 --> 00:53:00.171]  What about the song lyrics were you most attracted to in terms of like, what did you, like you've seen out in the real world and then you hear Alex singing about it and people go, oh, he's crazy, he's crazy.
[00:53:00.191 --> 00:53:05.255]  But then, you know, in your video, you even have real life examples showing people, these people, how they really are.
[00:53:06.849 --> 00:53:12.154]  Yeah, you know, I mean, I watch the show and everybody knows Alex is passionate.
[00:53:13.195 --> 00:53:17.138]  And sometimes maybe to some people a little over the top.
[00:53:17.178 --> 00:53:25.225]  But the way I look at it, you gotta imagine this guy's been, you know, trying to bring things to light, you know, since like Waco.
[00:53:25.245 --> 00:53:26.366]  And, and
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:35.046]  Imagine you being that person and you're trying to bring all this stuff to light for decades, and nobody is really paying attention.
[00:53:35.086 --> 00:53:50.461]  Even though now, you know, more and more people are paying attention and waking up, but it's just kind of cool to know that even though he's outrageous sometimes, there's truth behind what he's got a lot of knowledge of.
[00:53:50.521 --> 00:53:52.283]  I don't know how he remembers all this stuff, honestly.
[00:53:53.837 --> 00:54:07.242]  Yeah, we have trouble keeping up with him sometimes here at the office as well, because he is a walking thesaurus, dictionary, and he has a very good memory in terms of remembering events, conversations he's had.
[00:54:07.262 --> 00:54:11.724]  It's pretty uncanny.
[00:54:12.004 --> 00:54:14.766]  What's been the reaction, I guess, to your fan base to this song?
[00:54:14.866 --> 00:54:15.826]  What do they think of it?
[00:54:15.846 --> 00:54:18.347]  You know, it's pretty positive.
[00:54:19.737 --> 00:54:22.878]  I don't know if they understand what's really going on.
[00:54:22.938 --> 00:54:26.419]  I mean, if what this even is, they think that this is just our new single.
[00:54:26.459 --> 00:54:32.340]  For anybody who thinks that, we actually have a new radio single out called, When It Rains, I Pour.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.181]  And that's on the radio actually starting yesterday.
[00:54:35.201 --> 00:54:36.901]  It was the official ad date.
[00:54:36.941 --> 00:54:38.101]  So y'all be looking for that.
[00:54:40.122 --> 00:54:43.583]  You know, and other than that, we just play music for a living.
[00:54:43.603 --> 00:54:44.263]  That's what we do.
[00:54:44.343 --> 00:54:44.763]  Tomorrow,
[00:54:45.956 --> 00:54:52.459]  I guess Friday we'll be in Waco at the Backyard and then, like you were saying, in Bastrop at the Rodeo on Saturday.
[00:54:52.479 --> 00:54:54.040]  And then the next week we'll be in Montana.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.100]  I mean, we're all over the place.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:01.743]  We basically played in, I think, 44 states and France and some other places.
[00:55:01.823 --> 00:55:05.965]  And we've been doing this for about eight years because, you know, this is just what we love to do.
[00:55:07.347 --> 00:55:15.554]  And what have you seen, I guess, you've been doing it for eight years, so you've been through most of the Obama administration, and then you've seen, you know, now Trump Nation coming in.
[00:55:15.955 --> 00:55:17.856]  What has been the effect with your fans?
[00:55:17.896 --> 00:55:22.260]  Have you noticed more people in your fan base are pro-Trump, anti-Trump?
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.121]  How does that fit?
[00:55:24.362 --> 00:55:31.789]  Definitely pro-Trump, and we have some songs that are, you know, we have a Second Amendment song, it's called Shotgun Raffle under 45.
[00:55:31.949 --> 00:55:34.331]  So when we sing it, you know, occasionally I will
[00:55:35.409 --> 00:55:39.371]  Talk about Trump or something, and the crowd usually reacts with a lot of cheers.
[00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:43.752]  You know, nobody really believes these polls anymore, at least I don't.
[00:55:44.692 --> 00:55:46.613]  You know, they've been proven wrong so many times.
[00:55:47.894 --> 00:55:50.054]  Why even pay attention to them at this point?
[00:55:50.475 --> 00:55:54.736]  And I feel that a lot of people are feeling that way all across the nation.
[00:55:54.796 --> 00:56:00.398]  Everywhere we go, we see a lot of, you know, conservatism and that kind of thing.
[00:56:00.598 --> 00:56:02.299]  Of course, you know, it's country music.
[00:56:03.394 --> 00:56:12.842]  You know, it's good to see, like, real true American values becoming more prevalent and more, I guess, mainstream, you know?
[00:56:13.422 --> 00:56:14.503]  Well, and I'll say this.
[00:56:14.703 --> 00:56:23.831]  I think country music was hijacked at some point to become more mainstream in terms of going along with the party line, where, you know, you have this bro country.
[00:56:24.491 --> 00:56:25.952]  And I'm not a big fan of that.
[00:56:26.032 --> 00:56:28.034]  I like the old school country, like what you're doing.
[00:56:28.334 --> 00:56:32.478]  And you're kind of mixing rock and country together, which you have a really good synthesis on.
[00:56:33.058 --> 00:56:43.261]  But, you know, just seeing that, how these different, when things get upper echelon and more mainstream, they get hijacked by special interests that want you to push, you know, going along with the system.
[00:56:43.881 --> 00:56:49.122]  And so I guess my final question here to you is, do you plan on playing this live to your fans?
[00:56:50.303 --> 00:56:53.823]  You know, I hadn't even thought about that till a little earlier.
[00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:56.704]  I was like, hey, we're going to Wake, we're going to Bastrop.
[00:56:56.744 --> 00:56:58.525]  Those guys are just down there in Austin.
[00:56:58.745 --> 00:56:59.485]  And I was like,
[00:57:00.123 --> 00:57:01.425]  Why don't we play it?
[00:57:01.506 --> 00:57:05.653]  So yes, I'm going to play this song this weekend at both my shows.
[00:57:06.635 --> 00:57:12.805]  So if you're anywhere in the area of Waco or Bastrop, y'all come check us out, and we'll definitely jam this tune.
[00:57:13.669 --> 00:57:13.749]  Yes.
[00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:45.030]  Get into it, man.
[00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:45.390]  Do a video.
[00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:09.648]  The worst thing that can happen is you're going to have fun making a video, you know, and you'll get the word out even more.
[00:58:09.768 --> 00:58:16.749]  So I think it was pretty brilliant how you guys turned this whole thing around, and I'm just excited to be a part of it.
[00:58:17.449 --> 00:58:19.069]  Well, that's one of our mottos here.
[00:58:19.129 --> 00:58:21.450]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:23.090]  So thanks for joining us, JB Patterson.

[00:58:34.492 --> 00:58:36.574]  But we definitely agree on the Second Amendment, which is great.
