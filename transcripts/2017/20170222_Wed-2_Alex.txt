[00:00:39.364 --> 00:00:42.985]  Sweden!
[00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:51.048]  You look at what's happening last night in Sweden!
[00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:59.391]  Isn't it strange how all the leftists who mocked Trump about his last night in Sweden quote are suddenly so quiet about what happened?
[00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:09.655]  Last night in Sweden, men in a migrant suburb of Stockholm rioted, burned cars and attacked reporters, shopkeepers and police officers because cops arrested a drug dealer.
[00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:16.038]  So I put out a challenge for lefties who thought that Sweden's crime-ridden suburbs were safe to visit themselves.
[00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:21.860]  Prompting a bunch of D-rate celebrities to shamelessly virtue-signal about how progressive they are.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.263]  The kind of people who live in the whitest areas possible and would f**k themselves if they went anywhere near an Islamic ghetto.
[00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:34.526]  Unlike yours truly who got chased out of one Molenbeek days after the Paris Massacre.
[00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:42.329]  My challenge was accepted by Tim Pool who was then told by other left-wing journalists not to investigate Sweden's migrant suburbs.
[00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.829]  Really?
[00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.211]  Journalists scared of someone doing journalism.
[00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:52.737]  But if Sweden's migrant suburbs are so culturally enriched and safe as you claim, what are you afraid of?
[00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:53.617]  The truth.
[00:01:53.777 --> 00:01:59.762]  The truth about a country that's so safe it holds the proud honour of being the rape capital of Europe.
[00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:07.008]  A country where rapes are so commonplace that migrant culprits laugh at their victims as they report it to the police.
[00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:08.689]  No!
[00:02:16.296 --> 00:02:32.464]  I mean, it's so safe that Turkish government newspapers are placing ads warning their citizens about it.
[00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:38.067]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that when television crews visit them to prove that they're safe,
[00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.684]  They're physically attacked by migrants.
[00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:47.270]  The police leave, and as we prepare to go, young men, masking their faces, arrive.
[00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.491]  Good, you're doing good.
[00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:49.412]  You're doing good?
[00:02:49.432 --> 00:02:49.512]  Yeah.
[00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:50.433]  Okay, very good.
[00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:51.494]  Okay, you too.
[00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:52.214]  And attack.
[00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:52.334]  Go!
[00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:52.434]  Go!
[00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:12.307]  There's no need to be unkind.
[00:03:12.327 --> 00:03:20.615]  The gang's attention turns when a local intervenes and drives his mobility scooter into the most violent attack.
[00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:24.216]  We've been individually attacked.
[00:03:24.296 --> 00:03:25.577]  Twice.
[00:03:25.617 --> 00:03:27.077]  Some man has been punched.
[00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:28.558]  The producer's been punched.
[00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:30.198]  You've been run over, the cameraman.
[00:03:30.218 --> 00:03:33.420]  We've all been assaulted and insulted.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.302]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that filmmakers fear for their lives as they're assaulted on the street.
[00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:44.844]  While we were setting up a shoot at a neighboring location, we were approached by five men and told to leave.
[00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:49.346]  While my crew took off, I stayed to simply ask why we had to leave.
[00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.420]  Because I was still wired, we have the sound of what happened next.
[00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:32.633]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that ambulance workers are demanding riot gear to go anywhere near them.
[00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:40.397]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that Swedish citizens are demanding bulletproof vests while the government tries to ban them.
[00:04:40.438 --> 00:04:48.042]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that there are 55 no-go zones, the vast majority of which are migrant suburbs.
[00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:57.761]  There are now 55 declared no-go zones in Sweden where police have to escort ambulances to ensure their safety.
[00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:01.945]  Oh, but the police do go there, so how dare you call them no-go zones?
[00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:02.205]  Yeah.
[00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:05.728]  They go there and they're attacked with rocks and missiles.
[00:05:06.108 --> 00:05:07.350]  That's not safe!
[00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.074]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that pro-immigration Swedish politicians and celebrities
[00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:15.016]  Live nowhere near them!
[00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:20.980]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that in some areas, meter maids have just stopped going.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.864]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that maintenance companies have refused to service customers who live there.
[00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:36.430]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that some Somali immigrants want to leave because their violence-plagued homeland is safer.
[00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.455]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that immigrant-led riots and mass burning of cars is commonplace, including
[00:05:43.975 --> 00:05:45.075]  Last night in Sweden.
[00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:55.797]  Sweden's migrant suburbs are so safe that Malmo is known as Sweden's Chicago.
[00:05:55.917 --> 00:06:02.119]  It's one of the most dangerous cities in the whole of Western Europe with a murder rate higher than Paris and London.
[00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:06.059]  Malmo has a foreign population of around 43% and areas like RosengÃ¥rd are 90% Muslim.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.761]  Well, I'm sure that's just a coincidence.
[00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:19.222]  42-year-old police veteran Chief Superintendent Torsten Olofsson says that migrants comprise the majority of people being arrested in the city.
[00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:25.383]  He also says that explosions and grenade attacks are routine as a form of intimidation.
[00:06:25.463 --> 00:06:33.785]  And Swedes are so pleased with the impact that mass immigration has had on their country that the far-right anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats
[00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:35.486]  Why has their support doubled?
[00:06:50.778 --> 00:07:00.382]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that 53% of prisoners serving long-term sentences in Sweden have a foreign background.
[00:07:00.522 --> 00:07:12.786]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that veteran police officer Peter Springer says that almost every suspect involved in a serious violent crime is called Mohammed or another Islamic name.
[00:07:12.906 --> 00:07:16.747]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that less than 500
[00:07:18.448 --> 00:07:23.992]  Out of 160,000 refugees who arrived in 2016 have a job.
[00:07:24.192 --> 00:07:30.317]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that half of all jobless are foreigners.
[00:07:30.477 --> 00:07:38.543]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that 58% of welfare payments go to migrants.
[00:07:38.803 --> 00:07:48.292]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that ISIS flags have been legalized and returning jihadists are being considered for welfare payments.
[00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:56.100]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that migrants are raping women at anti-racism festivals.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:03.944]  Over the past two years, dozens of young women, some as young as 12, were raped at these festivals across Sweden by hundreds of young immigrants.
[00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:08.967]  They used a tactic where dozens of men surround one or more girls in circles.
[00:08:09.427 --> 00:08:15.951]  While the men in the inner circle sexually attacks their victims, the outer circle distracts and keeps out anyone who would stop it.
[00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:22.957]  The attacks have become so common that some bands, most notably Mumford & Sons, refuse to play in Sweden.
[00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:26.720]  This has happened multiple times and to multiple victims.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:34.406]  Then the issue is that when it is reported, this was widely known by the people who were there, the police that was on the scene, but then it was
[00:08:35.367 --> 00:08:36.428]  They put the lid on it.
[00:08:36.648 --> 00:08:37.849]  So we... They covered it up.
[00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:38.570]  They covered it up.
[00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:45.435]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that preschool kids are playing ISIS games.
[00:08:45.636 --> 00:08:55.544]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that the words pray to Allah or die alongside an ISIS flag was spray-painted on the side of a school.
[00:08:55.724 --> 00:09:02.830]  Integration of immigrants in Sweden has been so successful that an ISIS supporter was employed as an immigration officer.
[00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.231]  The Huffington Post claims that deadly crime has decreased over time in Sweden.
[00:09:07.271 --> 00:09:09.912]  The New York Times also claimed crime was decreasing.
[00:09:10.152 --> 00:09:12.112]  And that's fake news!
[00:09:12.132 --> 00:09:14.913]  Lethal violence has increased 29% since 2014.
[00:09:16.273 --> 00:09:18.434]  Sex crimes have doubled since 2012.
[00:09:19.094 --> 00:09:23.535]  Gun violence has increased 84% over the last nine years.
[00:09:23.715 --> 00:09:26.696]  All the sources for those stats are in the description below.
[00:09:26.736 --> 00:09:31.837]  The Swedish government does not record the ethnicity of those involved in crime, reports the Huffington Post.
[00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:34.199]  Oh, gee, I wonder why that is.
[00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:38.283]  I wonder why they stopped producing reports on this back in 2005.
[00:09:38.863 --> 00:09:47.371]  Could it possibly be because the 2005 report showed immigrants to be vastly over-represented in crime stats?
[00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:47.791]  Donald Trump!
[00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:10.731]  is not
[00:10:25.247 --> 00:10:25.547]  I think?
[00:10:42.754 --> 00:10:44.755]  And don't give me that s*** about Islamophobia, okay?
[00:10:44.775 --> 00:10:45.556]  I have a Muslim background.
[00:10:45.596 --> 00:10:47.477]  I don't have a problem with reasonable Muslims.
[00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:14.355]  ...immigration policy.
[00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:19.400]  I have a problem with irresponsible politics and bad decisions by politicians.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.581]  That's my problem.
[00:11:20.741 --> 00:11:30.249]  And now we're seeing these big media headlines about how Sweden has no clue what Trump is talking about, so he must just be a big old dummy.
[00:11:30.849 --> 00:11:31.050]  That's...
[00:11:31.912 --> 00:11:35.275]  Sweden knows exactly what Trump is talking about.
[00:11:35.455 --> 00:11:42.741]  If they were to see his whole speech in its full context, they could probably figure out what he's referring to.
[00:11:42.921 --> 00:11:44.282]  Forget last night in Sweden.
[00:11:44.522 --> 00:11:47.465]  What about the last couple of years in Sweden?
[00:11:47.585 --> 00:11:49.746]  Or the last decade in Sweden?
[00:11:49.827 --> 00:11:50.527]  They're not lying.
[00:11:50.707 --> 00:11:57.573]  There is a huge problem with crime and rapes and sex attacks, sexual assaults, molestations related
[00:11:57.873 --> 00:11:58.534]  To migrants.
[00:11:58.675 --> 00:12:02.261]  You really want to pick a fight with us over immigration.
[00:12:02.842 --> 00:12:05.586]  And your example is Sweden!
[00:12:08.035 --> 00:12:09.255]  You really want to pretend that?
[00:12:09.275 --> 00:12:11.236]  Because Donald Trump made a gaffe.
[00:12:11.696 --> 00:12:15.918]  That means Sweden is totally safe and doesn't have a problem with mass immigration.
[00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:20.139]  Trump's only real mistake was to specify one night in Sweden.
[00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:23.120]  This s*** is happening almost every night.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:31.083]  And the Islamist-aligned left won't tell you about it because it shatters their utopian bubble that mass immigration works.
[00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.064]  It doesn't.
[00:12:32.464 --> 00:12:38.188]  And Sweden is a terrifying warning from Europe for America not to follow the same path.
[00:12:38.348 --> 00:12:44.912]  The left's big lie about mass immigration being beneficial is why people voted for Brexit and Trump.
[00:12:45.192 --> 00:12:50.996]  You can keep lying, you can keep virtue signaling about it, and we'll keep winning.
[00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:51.837]  Sweden!
[00:12:53.198 --> 00:12:54.078]  Who would believe this?
[00:12:54.158 --> 00:12:54.638]  Sweden!
[00:13:08.743 --> 00:13:24.554]  This is a island that at its widest level is what 12 miles from shore to shore and at its smallest level or smallest
[00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:36.607]  Location, it's seven miles between one shore and the other.
[00:13:36.627 --> 00:13:38.568]  Is that correct?
[00:13:39.188 --> 00:13:45.132]  I don't have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.
[00:13:45.172 --> 00:13:55.439]  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over
[00:14:02.462 --> 00:14:19.010]  We've seen nothing that we can work, that I can work with President Bush on, and I'm disappointed because I thought that there might be some interest because of what he said in the campaign.
[00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.690]  What are we going to do?
[00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:23.552]  How can a president
[00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:52.762]  Who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC, and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families in
[00:14:55.344 --> 00:14:56.425]  What is Aleppo?
[00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:57.386]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[00:14:57.567 --> 00:14:59.609]  You are correct.
[00:15:07.085 --> 00:15:17.270]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea?
[00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:20.392]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing stop it.
[00:15:20.492 --> 00:15:23.514]  And notice, notice that she didn't say that they had
[00:15:34.358 --> 00:15:36.344]  Invaded Korea, which the Russians did invade.
[00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:37.989]  You guys got this on the Nightly News today.
[00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:38.952]  Will you guys put me some audio?
[00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:39.273]  Thanks.
[00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:41.440]  Notice that they don't...
[00:15:43.405 --> 00:15:45.626]  Say that they invaded Korea, which they didn't invade Korea, period.
[00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:46.626]  They don't say North or South.
[00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:52.647]  It just shows the massive, incredible disconnect with all of that.
[00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:55.668]  A lot of the people here that work here never run radios.
[00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:56.928]  I used to have an audio back in there.
[00:15:57.108 --> 00:16:01.769]  I am, so I need it, and that's why I hear the feeds and everything that's going on, so I always want that.
[00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:06.250]  I want to appreciate the crew staying up here late tonight on really no notice.
[00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:10.611]  Yesterday at about noon, I decided to do this 13-hour live broadcast because
[00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:19.233]  You know, this country's under attack, and the American people know that there was an attempt to completely end all the basic freedoms that were here.
[00:16:20.073 --> 00:16:29.756]  And there was an attempt to, under Hillary, when she was running for president, to ban free speech and shut down drug reports, shut down info wars, shut down all we do.
[00:16:31.442 --> 00:16:33.524]  Any opposition to this globalist takeover.
[00:16:34.345 --> 00:16:47.756]  And since I announced this yesterday that the Google subsidiary banned us from having online advertising, one big way we fund our operation, we've been contacted by some of the other big news sites and indeed they say that's happened to them.
[00:16:48.197 --> 00:16:49.758]  We're going to be interviewing them in the next few days.
[00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:56.224]  A lot of them, like Breitbart and others, already had this happen to them and they were just simply trying to talk to the companies and say, listen,
[00:16:57.375 --> 00:17:05.100]  You can't let black people come into your store and then say, you're black, I'm not gonna, you know, sell you food or gasoline.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.203]  You can't do it if somebody's gay, you know, like the people trying to get a cake when they were gay.
[00:17:09.683 --> 00:17:15.367]  And you can't do it if somebody is an Americana or patriot or libertarian or conservative news site.
[00:17:16.607 --> 00:17:20.330]  Bar them from access to a big monopolistic market you control.
[00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.231]  I mean, there's no way.
[00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:24.352]  If you have a monopoly, you gotta let everybody in.
[00:17:24.773 --> 00:17:26.694]  And Google's got pretty much a monopoly.
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.141]  But that's what they're doing.
[00:17:29.721 --> 00:17:32.683]  And I think we're stupid with our little front grips like AdRoll and others.
[00:17:33.363 --> 00:17:37.086]  And sure, we could go with other third-party advertisers out there, but not to get access to Google.
[00:17:37.946 --> 00:17:44.291]  And so this is part of a system where if we put up with this censorship, it's precedent-setting.
[00:17:44.371 --> 00:17:47.213]  It's meant to go after the entire, quote, alt-right.
[00:17:47.753 --> 00:17:55.178]  Anybody that's nationalistic, anybody that's patriotic, anybody that wants to promote systems of freedom, they say we don't have a right to exist.
[00:17:56.681 --> 00:17:57.882]  This is a classic form of tyranny.
[00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:17.550]  About Donald Trump.
[00:18:18.171 --> 00:18:19.371]  Negative, positive, doesn't matter.
[00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:25.835]  They are trying to curtail those, and if they're not negative, they're blocking it, and if you get popular, they just ban you.
[00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:39.862]  Now, Digg did this the last decade, and they made themselves a complete joke, but the point is, the corporations have lined up now, and they've decided, well, if Facebook, and if Microsoft, and if Twitter, and if Google, and if Reddit, if we all line up together,
[00:18:41.007 --> 00:18:49.350]  And start blocking libertarian or conservative or pro-Donald Trump or pro-nationalist websites from operating and not letting them get access through these platforms.
[00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.291]  But don't tell anybody because it's racketeering.
[00:18:51.311 --> 00:18:54.132]  It's organized crime when they collude together to violate a group's rights.
[00:18:55.453 --> 00:18:56.893]  If we do that, the public won't notice.
[00:18:56.953 --> 00:18:57.914]  Now, we showed the letter.
[00:18:58.154 --> 00:18:58.774]  We can pull it up.
[00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.094]  Paul Watson wrote an article about it.
[00:19:00.114 --> 00:19:00.735]  We can show the letter.
[00:19:01.595 --> 00:19:02.936]  We're AdRoll, not AdBlade.
[00:19:02.956 --> 00:19:03.756]  That's another nice company.
[00:19:03.776 --> 00:19:04.476]  We've worked with them as well.
[00:19:05.156 --> 00:19:07.757]  AdRoll, a subsidiary that works with Google.
[00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:08.858]  It's a little front company.
[00:19:11.189 --> 00:19:14.350]  They sent us a letter and they said, there's always the denials.
[00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:27.815]  It's like the London Guardian and the Observer and Vanity Fair and Variety and they all come out in the entertainment publications and say, the New Homeland demonizes Alex Jones.
[00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:31.676]  They have a character that says horrible things in his accent to demonize him.
[00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:32.736]  And then I go, that's terrible.
[00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:33.857]  They go, you're crazy.
[00:19:34.097 --> 00:19:35.617]  Nobody's got TV shows about you.
[00:19:35.997 --> 00:19:36.738]  You're not important.
[00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:37.458]  Nobody's watching you.
[00:19:39.892 --> 00:19:42.534]  Chris Carter didn't say the new X-Files was based on you, though he did.
[00:19:43.054 --> 00:19:45.296]  In, again, Variety and Hollywood Reporter.
[00:19:45.997 --> 00:19:48.739]  Again, it's like where they attack you and say, oh, we're making fun of him!
[00:19:49.219 --> 00:19:51.561]  By the way, Obamacare is free, but we never said it was.
[00:19:52.241 --> 00:19:53.722]  It's, again, playing God.
[00:19:53.782 --> 00:19:55.284]  They treat you like you don't exist.
[00:19:55.584 --> 00:20:00.728]  That's a mental illness in narcissistic, arrogant people, I've noticed, is they think they're invincible.
[00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.451]  And they think they can sit there and say things to you and that
[00:20:05.211 --> 00:20:09.553]  You're just under their sway and under their control, and they take your kindness for weakness.
[00:20:10.033 --> 00:20:11.073]  This is what they're doing.
[00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:14.495]  So, we made 3.3 million dollars.
[00:20:14.535 --> 00:20:19.296]  When I say made, I'm not afraid to be a capitalist and actually have profit, but my goal is freedom.
[00:20:19.316 --> 00:20:21.197]  That's what, you know, that's fortune favors the bold.
[00:20:22.558 --> 00:20:23.718]  The fortune I want is freedom.
[00:20:24.178 --> 00:20:30.361]  And so when I say we made 3.3 million dollars, that was off our advertising after expenses we spent in the last
[00:20:31.138 --> 00:20:31.498]  We're good to go.
[00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:03.880]  And we can try to hire folks in England, and we can do more, and more reporters here, and we've seen how far we've come.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.821]  We want to beat this thing.
[00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:05.862]  We don't want to just roll over.
[00:21:05.882 --> 00:21:07.744]  We want to have our own independent media.
[00:21:07.764 --> 00:21:09.345]  We're not funded by Goldman Sachs, the big banks.
[00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:12.420]  And the New York Times made phone calls.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.241]  They had a story on Monday.
[00:21:13.281 --> 00:21:14.342]  They honed in where he made money.
[00:21:14.362 --> 00:21:16.323]  It was more of an intelligence gathering operation.
[00:21:16.343 --> 00:21:17.003]  He didn't already do that.
[00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:19.145]  I even told family they're going to shut us down next week.
[00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:20.466]  Because I knew what it was.
[00:21:20.486 --> 00:21:22.287]  They had a special guy that's involved in that.
[00:21:22.927 --> 00:21:26.690]  And it was called for banning the fake news, you know, because they define us, their enemies, the fake news.
[00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:30.232]  You just disappear kind of in an electronic gulag, electronic ghetto.
[00:21:30.272 --> 00:21:30.612]  It's okay.
[00:21:30.632 --> 00:21:31.092]  It's liberal.
[00:21:31.313 --> 00:21:31.653]  It's liberal.
[00:21:32.434 --> 00:21:38.448]  China has mobile execution vans and suicide nets and slave factories and forced abortion.
[00:21:38.508 --> 00:21:41.154]  It's okay because they're not white and it's liberal.
[00:21:42.199 --> 00:21:47.863]  So if Mao kills 70-plus million people, or 80 million, depending on the numbers, it's okay because he's Chinese, you know.
[00:21:48.243 --> 00:21:52.526]  It's like, oh, they're killing Buddhists all over China by the hundreds of thousands a year and selling their organs?
[00:21:52.546 --> 00:21:53.987]  It's okay because they're Chinese.
[00:21:54.608 --> 00:21:55.028]  It's liberal.
[00:21:55.048 --> 00:21:57.950]  It's like, when they do it, it's like Arabs come to Europe and the U.S.
[00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.172]  and Muslims and rape people en masse at rock concerts.
[00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:03.254]  The police, they were not charging them.
[00:22:03.294 --> 00:22:04.735]  It's their culture, you know.
[00:22:06.596 --> 00:22:09.078]  It's like the Nazis' culture, you know, is to launch big wars and kill people.
[00:22:09.098 --> 00:22:11.180]  Oh, but that was a bad culture because that was a white culture.
[00:22:12.728 --> 00:22:13.708]  That's where all this is going.
[00:22:14.649 --> 00:22:16.110]  And so, you know, here's the deal.
[00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.271]  That's a big piece of the pie to fund this operation.
[00:22:21.252 --> 00:22:25.774]  It costs $40 million a year or so to fund InfoWars, all the bandwidth and all the costs.
[00:22:25.834 --> 00:22:27.935]  And I'll tell you, I'm not the best at business, man.
[00:22:28.275 --> 00:22:29.516]  There's a lot of stuff going on around here.
[00:22:29.536 --> 00:22:34.458]  But the point is, is that we mean our best and we're doing the best we can to reach out to people.
[00:22:34.498 --> 00:22:35.538]  And we're totally kicking ass.
[00:22:35.818 --> 00:22:39.400]  When you have tens of millions of people on your own streams every week, audio and video, it's expensive.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.441]  Millions and millions of dollars a quarter.
[00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:44.703]  And so the globalists think we're like sociopaths like them.
[00:22:44.723 --> 00:22:47.808]  They think, if we cut out this, they must all be about profit.
[00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:49.892]  They'll back off and give in to us.
[00:22:49.932 --> 00:22:51.254]  And we'll be intimidating for wars.
[00:22:51.595 --> 00:22:52.617]  It'll be a message to everybody else.
[00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:55.381]  So if we do this, they'll roll over.
[00:22:56.664 --> 00:22:58.705]  Well, you haven't studied history, and you haven't studied us.
[00:22:59.025 --> 00:22:59.665]  It's the opposite.
[00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:13.971]  I'm having to look at lawyers, I'm having to get ready for litigation, because I can't have there be a precedent set where you dehumanize people because they're nationalists, or patriots, or conservatives, or Christians, and say, we're an open thing, but you can't have political ads.
[00:23:14.011 --> 00:23:16.772]  Our ads weren't political, but AdRoll ran political ads.
[00:23:17.412 --> 00:23:22.154]  They were trying to claim we were violating campaign finance, which is what Hillary was saying before the election, with no law.
[00:23:22.194 --> 00:23:27.296]  They just said, shut down Drudge, shut down Infowars, because, shut down Breitbart, they're political.
[00:23:27.636 --> 00:23:35.240]  So all that needs that cover is having the Justice Department, even after Trump's gone, they don't care, they're all rogue, they're all arrogant, full of themselves, nobody's ever had a job in their life that was real.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.502]  You're gonna get a Federal Elections Commission raid on you, Breitbart's advertiser, unless you back off.
[00:23:41.782 --> 00:23:42.743]  You're gonna get that too.
[00:23:44.212 --> 00:23:51.538]  I mean, you have Democrats rioting in the street calling, you know, Trump's whole cabinet scumbags, don't know what continent they're on, don't know what world they're in.
[00:23:52.659 --> 00:23:53.440]  But that's okay.
[00:23:56.002 --> 00:23:58.644]  That's okay, because we're not human, we don't exist.
[00:23:58.664 --> 00:23:59.284]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:24:00.185 --> 00:24:01.686]  Look at this photo of your TV viewer.
[00:24:02.187 --> 00:24:07.051]  When you drop a bunch of acid and walk through the festival grounds, the news will say, I said they were on acid.
[00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:09.453]  Well, the Clintons admittedly have been drug heads, but I'm not even bringing that up.
[00:24:10.694 --> 00:24:11.875]  Look at them just a few weeks ago.
[00:24:11.975 --> 00:24:14.177]  They stole billions out of Haiti.
[00:24:14.197 --> 00:24:15.157]  They're totally criminal.
[00:24:15.377 --> 00:24:16.478]  They're involved in all this evil.
[00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:19.601]  They got caught being Russian and Chinese communist spies.
[00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:23.944]  But they were the ones that wanted to censor the dark heart Alex Jones.
[00:24:24.324 --> 00:24:25.645]  And this is who rules us?
[00:24:27.286 --> 00:24:27.927]  So here's the deal.
[00:24:29.288 --> 00:24:32.070]  All you do is make us rock and roll gold.
[00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.711]  We're going to the Reddit questions here in a moment.
[00:24:35.185 --> 00:24:49.100]  When you come out and you lie about us and you make up things we said and you go around everywhere and have the New York Times, Washington Post say, ban Alex Jones, shut him up, shut his crew up, anybody that's a thinking person goes, we better check out Infowars.com.
[00:24:51.527 --> 00:25:04.036]  But again, I will have to really hustle, and I'd rather be putting news out than fighting the globalists, to try to squirrel around in the next year for what was going to be $5 million, $3.3 million last year with this Google deal.
[00:25:04.376 --> 00:25:05.377]  And they're not going to stop there.
[00:25:05.937 --> 00:25:08.199]  See, they're going to go, oh, see, it's a precedent.
[00:25:08.239 --> 00:25:09.200]  They're doing it to everybody.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:26.786]  And then they win and then they shut everything off and the president is isolated, then you don't get your borders controlled, you don't get your tax cuts, you don't get your sovereignty, you don't get America First, you don't get any of the things because you're under globalism now with a bunch of technocrats that think they own you and your family and think you're dumb and think you failed.
[00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:34.071]  If this doesn't expand, I'll just cut people's pay and lay people off.
[00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:35.171]  Okay?
[00:25:35.531 --> 00:25:36.931]  Which I'm ready to do.
[00:25:37.491 --> 00:25:40.072]  And then you can sit there and enjoy the Globals raping the hell out of you.
[00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:41.132]  It's real simple.
[00:25:41.452 --> 00:25:42.412]  They think you're stupid.
[00:25:42.793 --> 00:25:43.753]  They think you're failed.
[00:25:44.053 --> 00:25:51.734]  They think you'll submit to open, naked, historical, hardcore tyranny like saying black people can't walk into a restaurant and eat.
[00:25:51.754 --> 00:25:54.935]  Imagine if I was white and Apple said you can't come in here.
[00:25:55.135 --> 00:25:59.296]  Well, Alex, you can't come in an Apple store at the mall at Martin, Krieger and Austin because you're white.
[00:26:00.675 --> 00:26:05.598]  Or, we're not going to let people on Reddit, even though it's the most popular, share Donald links, because we don't care about popularity.
[00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:14.825]  We care about butt-licking at the, you know, San Francisco meetings, and just being in with the big bankers, and Google patting us on the head while they run, you know, their slave factories, along with Apple.
[00:26:15.665 --> 00:26:16.205]  That's what this is.
[00:26:16.225 --> 00:26:18.247]  This is a horrible group of monsters.
[00:26:18.287 --> 00:26:19.528]  Zuckerberg's a monster.
[00:26:20.068 --> 00:26:21.489]  All of them just do horrible things.
[00:26:22.169 --> 00:26:30.235]  They admit you're dumb fucks, excuse that French, that's what they call you, when you sit there and you believe in them, and you follow their ideas, and you do what they say.
[00:26:32.972 --> 00:26:39.456]  So, I want to encourage everybody to understand that they believe they're gods as they try to inject us into this matrix-like system.
[00:26:41.097 --> 00:26:42.698]  So, InfoWars needs your support.
[00:26:43.319 --> 00:26:47.422]  The Defense of Liberty 13-hour broadcast special is now live at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:27:04.474 --> 00:27:06.115]  They say you're not allowed to be political and support Trump.

[00:27:55.887 --> 00:28:01.170]  It's a second round, a new print, new design, new color print, but that's it of these after that.

[00:28:22.405 --> 00:28:25.226]  The globalists hate that InfoWars is not beholden to the mega banks.
[00:28:25.506 --> 00:28:30.930]  Everything they do is about monopoly or government handouts because it means our message cannot be censored or controlled.
[00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.472]  Because we are not an establishment fund and we are powered solely by your support.
[00:28:34.832 --> 00:28:38.715]  Help defend InfoWars and take advantage of these new mega specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:38.975 --> 00:28:42.157]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:42.197 --> 00:28:48.941]  Now before I go to ask me anything and Buckley and your comments and more for the next hour and then take calls and have other guests in here,
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.621]  I want to explain something to TV viewers and people that are listening on the radio.
[00:28:56.282 --> 00:28:57.402]  You're seeing history happen.
[00:28:57.422 --> 00:28:58.663]  I want to play this clip I mentioned.
[00:28:59.083 --> 00:29:10.327]  Maxine Water calls Trump cabinet a bunch of scumbags because these are people that are so arrogant and delusional that they don't know who the president is.
[00:29:10.367 --> 00:29:12.807]  They think it's Bush and the same press conference.
[00:29:12.827 --> 00:29:14.628]  They think, again, Russia invaded Korea.
[00:29:14.908 --> 00:29:15.808]  Don't say North or South.
[00:29:16.189 --> 00:29:17.129]  It's a false period.
[00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.431]  That they just think they own you with their BS line, you're a racist, so bow down and kiss her butt.
[00:29:24.752 --> 00:29:28.793]  And they're openly saying, well he got the term, drain the swamp, and she's, you know, corrupt.
[00:29:29.573 --> 00:29:31.774]  Crooked Hillary from Russia, because nobody else gets that.
[00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:33.635]  And you're like, that's how brain damaged?
[00:29:33.655 --> 00:29:35.415]  I mean, I don't mean that mean, that's who she is.
[00:29:36.115 --> 00:29:36.955]  She's brain damaged.
[00:29:36.996 --> 00:29:39.216]  I mean, she literally thinks we got it from the Russians.
[00:29:39.256 --> 00:29:45.178]  Like, I got up this morning and I, you know, I cooked eggs for my kids or whatever, and it was because the Russians did it.
[00:29:46.377 --> 00:29:50.500]  And then they accuse the greatest patriots in this country of being Russian agents when no one's buying it.
[00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:54.503]  And I had Kurt Weldon, the former congressman on this, coming back on.
[00:29:54.543 --> 00:29:58.505]  He said, look, ten years ago I got death-threatened and everything about what I knew about the Clintons and Russia and China.
[00:29:58.806 --> 00:30:00.387]  I'm just going to release it all in the next few days on your show.
[00:30:00.407 --> 00:30:01.347]  And he talked about some of it.
[00:30:02.408 --> 00:30:10.694]  I mean, that's the point we've reached where this country is so overrun with treason and we believe now hospitality is just bending over to censorship and control.
[00:30:10.974 --> 00:30:13.676]  Do you understand they are, as we speak,
[00:30:15.137 --> 00:30:31.581]  Trying to destroy Breitbart, who I have no financial connection to, and taking their sponsors, taking their, won't even give them internet service, won't get, they're deleting their apps off the thing, not even having a reason, they're just, on iTunes.
[00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:36.663]  This is, see, Apple doesn't just run slave centers in China, and suicide nets.
[00:30:36.703 --> 00:30:37.843]  They want to do that here.
[00:30:38.163 --> 00:30:44.105]  They literally are a bunch of assholes that think they rule you completely, and it's all about crushing you with their will.
[00:30:45.418 --> 00:30:49.960]  They're flying around on jet helicopters and mistresses and, you know, don't even let their own kids have iPads.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.982]  They're just, they're flaming, flaming uncool people.
[00:30:54.462 --> 00:30:57.143]  And you submitting to them greases the skids.
[00:30:57.203 --> 00:31:02.205]  So, you go pay your tithe and buy a $500 iPhone, and I'm not judging anybody.
[00:31:02.725 --> 00:31:04.626]  The point is, it's all made by slaves.
[00:31:05.306 --> 00:31:07.687]  The point is, you can make your tithe to Infowars.
[00:31:08.248 --> 00:31:09.208]  Not that I even need it.
[00:31:10.603 --> 00:31:13.007]  It's that I needed to run this operation.
[00:31:13.367 --> 00:31:18.514]  I almost wish sometimes they'd shut us down and I didn't have the excuse and I'd just let everybody fail and I could just write everybody off.
[00:31:18.574 --> 00:31:21.899]  But I can't do that because I know there's so many good people.
[00:31:21.979 --> 00:31:23.441]  So it's not a question of if.
[00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:25.523]  You're going to support us.
[00:31:25.723 --> 00:31:27.364]  You need Supermail.
[00:31:27.444 --> 00:31:28.384]  You need X2.
[00:31:28.785 --> 00:31:30.826]  You need Lung Cleanse.
[00:31:30.866 --> 00:31:33.367]  You need Oxy-Powder that flushes your guts out with good oxygen.
[00:31:33.627 --> 00:31:41.672]  You need our water filtration system so your kids aren't drinking glyphosate in thousands, I mean thousands in some areas, hundreds on average, of horrible chemicals in the water table.
[00:31:41.872 --> 00:31:51.278]  Whatever the best water filters are, the best storable food, the best t-shirts, the best made in America products, the best non-GMO heirloom seeds, the best everything, it's at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:53.311 --> 00:32:02.461]  And if you don't support us, and put your money where your mouth is, and defend free speech, which I know you're already doing, then you're aiding and abetting the enemy.
[00:32:05.063 --> 00:32:08.127]  But quite frankly, look, it's easy for you to donate, and I appreciate when you do that.
[00:32:09.522 --> 00:32:11.544]  You know, I don't have to give people raises or hire more people.
[00:32:12.525 --> 00:32:13.385]  I mean, I don't want to.
[00:32:13.445 --> 00:32:15.047]  I can, you know, I can cut back on what I'm doing.
[00:32:15.327 --> 00:32:22.152]  I can sit there with, like, a webmaster posting links and it's a website with basic things and probably be bigger myself if I monetarily want more money.
[00:32:22.172 --> 00:32:29.518]  And then I can have, like, a private jet and, you know, a mansion that, you know, the dog craps in because, you know, mansions are places where dogs go and crap that you don't see.
[00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:32.500]  Once I had a five-bedroom house and I never went upstairs.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.020]  I, you know, got a kitchen, a place for people to sleep, and you live there.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.281]  I'm not saying winning a big house is bad.
[00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:44.582]  It's that that's not my God, going to events and sitting around with candy-ass corporate guys and bragging who's got a bigger jet boat or something.
[00:32:45.423 --> 00:32:48.984]  It's I care about the future of humanity and standing up for what's right.
[00:32:49.024 --> 00:32:55.705]  And when you invest in us by spreading a link or an article or a video, you stand up for your own speech, whether you agree with us or not.
[00:32:56.185 --> 00:32:58.526]  So, I'll be honest with you.
[00:32:59.417 --> 00:33:06.082]  We've brought in a million dollars since yesterday, usually bring in $100,000, $150,000, but most of that's expensive, so $50,000.
[00:33:06.743 --> 00:33:13.288]  I don't even break even unless I'm bringing in $50,000, $60,000 of, quote, profit off what we sell to fund the whole platform.
[00:33:13.848 --> 00:33:18.172]  So, okay, they just took $3.3 million, what we made last year, it'll be $5 million this year on the graph.
[00:33:18.792 --> 00:33:24.214]  You know, I don't want to sit here every couple weeks doing this for 18-20 hours, begging you for support.
[00:33:24.434 --> 00:33:42.299]  If you don't want to kick the globalist ass and stop them taking over your family, and teaching your kids how to get blowjobs when they're age 5, and calling for world government, and all this other crap, and the tranny bathrooms to distract you from what's going on, and the cancer viruses and the vaccines, and the open borders, and all the rest of the gun control, and all the rest of it, then it's your choice.
[00:33:42.819 --> 00:33:45.380]  I'm only here so you can make that choice.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.580]  Understand that.
[00:33:49.847 --> 00:33:52.989]  I mean, I'm almost ready to evacuate you Tasmania or Kauai.
[00:33:53.049 --> 00:33:53.969]  I've been public about that.
[00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:55.230]  All the elite already did.
[00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.431]  They've already written you off.
[00:33:56.631 --> 00:33:57.751]  They think you're dumbasses.
[00:33:57.951 --> 00:33:59.432]  They think you're playing fantasy football.
[00:33:59.632 --> 00:34:02.954]  They think you know what's up your rear end and that you're done.
[00:34:03.314 --> 00:34:04.195]  I don't think you are.
[00:34:05.194 --> 00:34:06.395]  So, it's that simple.
[00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:10.358]  If the sleeping giant of every race, color, and creed, we're all the human race.
[00:34:10.638 --> 00:34:12.279]  I hate that of every race crap.
[00:34:12.579 --> 00:34:13.259]  Everybody loves it.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.122]  We're just one damn race with different color skin, we got red blood, the same genetics.
[00:34:17.442 --> 00:34:33.953]  If you want to stop being conned, and you want to understand why the whole global banking structure hates me so much, and why they want to demonize through peer pressure what we're saying, it's because what I'm covering, what I'm doing, let's say the enemy Superman, but a bad Superman, is kryptonite.
[00:34:34.313 --> 00:34:34.654]  Pure.
[00:34:35.795 --> 00:34:39.721]  So, you adopt this and go research what we're saying, it's game over.
[00:34:40.282 --> 00:34:41.183]  So more importantly,
[00:34:42.082 --> 00:34:45.804]  Than you even buying products that you absolutely need.
[00:34:46.504 --> 00:34:51.006]  Disinfectants, antibacterials, colloidal silver, incredible nanotech body armor.
[00:34:51.046 --> 00:34:52.207]  Nobody's else got that.
[00:34:52.527 --> 00:34:53.727]  That's patriots of the government.
[00:34:53.927 --> 00:34:56.288]  This was about to go to the public, gave it to us first.
[00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:57.829]  Combat One, all of it.
[00:34:58.029 --> 00:34:59.290]  What do you think's going on here?
[00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:04.692]  There are people that care in the corporations, in the government, in other areas that actually want to stop this.
[00:35:04.972 --> 00:35:08.134]  And they're doing their due diligence to try to help everybody one more time.
[00:35:09.033 --> 00:35:11.498]  I'm going to ask me anything for the next hour, then we'll bring Gaston here.
[00:35:11.759 --> 00:35:12.380]  But here's the deal.
[00:35:15.226 --> 00:35:16.248]  We brought in a million dollars.
[00:35:16.729 --> 00:35:16.889]  What?
[00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:17.631]  What people?
[00:35:17.731 --> 00:35:18.994]  Oh God, you got a million dollars?
[00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:20.316]  You gonna buy something with that?
[00:35:22.594 --> 00:35:23.575]  I said a million dollars.
[00:35:23.915 --> 00:35:27.237]  After costs and expenses of the products, $600,000.
[00:35:27.877 --> 00:35:36.103]  Those enemies just took what we make in the next year, $5 million that we would use to hire people and pay for bandwidth and do what?
[00:35:36.123 --> 00:35:36.563]  What do you think?
[00:35:36.583 --> 00:35:37.223]  All this is free?
[00:35:37.644 --> 00:35:42.147]  You think this $100,000 TV system behind me is free to show the public and counter the globalists?
[00:35:42.367 --> 00:35:43.728]  I want to kick their ass!
[00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.611]  I'm willing to go all the way.
[00:35:46.671 --> 00:35:47.411]  Everybody knows that.
[00:35:47.831 --> 00:35:49.752]  I'm willing to put my will completely against them.
[00:35:50.152 --> 00:35:50.632]  You know that.
[00:35:51.193 --> 00:35:51.953]  We can beat them.
[00:35:52.193 --> 00:35:55.875]  Look how we came from nowhere 20 years ago, with nobody knowing the Federal Reserve was private.
[00:35:56.095 --> 00:35:57.455]  T's removing the Federal Reserve.
[00:35:57.656 --> 00:35:59.356]  He's cutting taxes, regulations to the poor.
[00:35:59.656 --> 00:36:01.937]  The small businesses have the highest numbers since 1984.
[00:36:02.478 --> 00:36:04.719]  I want to see humanity explode.
[00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:10.121]  The globals want to be all rich and powerful, with you with nothing, so they can dictate everything they want to you.
[00:36:10.861 --> 00:36:11.882]  So, I know you know that.
[00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:23.896]  But quite frankly, if you don't support us and go to Infowars.com forward slash show, where there's a free feed right now, you can send everybody in an aggressive resistance to the AI technology and show it who's boss.
[00:36:24.036 --> 00:36:31.078]  Because this whole new world order system is about a struggle between humanity and a few evil assholes and the big high-tech stuff.
[00:36:31.458 --> 00:36:34.999]  So, this is just a beta test of what you're going to do in this fight.
[00:36:36.397 --> 00:36:42.160]  So, I don't care if you don't buy our awesome coffee, or our nutraceuticals, or whatever.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:47.563]  Just spread the link, spread the articles, or call into C-SPAN, and I know you're doing it, or start your own damn show.
[00:36:47.804 --> 00:36:49.244]  Just don't get into infighting with each other.
[00:36:49.345 --> 00:36:50.465]  Move forward against the globalists.
[00:36:50.905 --> 00:36:58.730]  Infowars.com forward slash show to make straight up donations, and Infowarsstore.com to buy the products, because I'm not going to sit here.
[00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:59.710]  People say, oh, just sue them.
[00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:01.071]  You know what a lawsuit's really like?
[00:37:01.091 --> 00:37:02.112]  And I've sued people in one.
[00:37:02.452 --> 00:37:03.874]  I gotta go get the best lawyers.
[00:37:04.134 --> 00:37:05.415]  I gotta give them the whole case law.
[00:37:05.435 --> 00:37:07.237]  I don't know more than lawyers half the time.
[00:37:07.477 --> 00:37:08.519]  I gotta line this up.
[00:37:08.799 --> 00:37:10.260]  I gotta sit there in depositions.
[00:37:10.521 --> 00:37:12.603]  I gotta claw stuff out of Ad Roll.
[00:37:12.883 --> 00:37:15.246]  I gotta expose how they met with big corporations.
[00:37:15.506 --> 00:37:22.854]  Tell them to do this and racketeering and the whole nine yards and just hope the president gets involved and bust up Google and these other anti-human scumbags.
[00:37:23.334 --> 00:37:26.839]  Who are all on a power trip because they got AI computers that can predict the future.
[00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:27.640]  Okay, great.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:33.168]  Why don't you predict the future and empower people and instead decide how to kill everybody so you can be a bunch of jerks?
[00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:39.136]  You think the universe and God is going to give you ascension and power, Eric Schmidt?
[00:37:40.322 --> 00:37:43.203]  Or Zuckerberg, or any of you people.
[00:37:43.483 --> 00:37:51.547]  You are psychopaths who were bent towards the devil's will and given control of this limited stuff in an attempt to frickin' destroy humanity.
[00:37:51.747 --> 00:37:52.767]  And you're not gonna get it.
[00:37:53.068 --> 00:37:53.688]  But here's the thing.
[00:37:54.904 --> 00:38:05.870]  I'm not going to roll over like Breitbart and try to bitch to Bannon who doesn't know what to do because he's not a bad guy because the president doesn't know how to come out and respond that his own media organization is being shut down.
[00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:07.050]  It's already happening.
[00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:08.711]  They're already saying shut us down on the news.
[00:38:08.891 --> 00:38:13.514]  They're already saying shut down anybody that wants to cut poor people's taxes because they believe they own you.
[00:38:14.074 --> 00:38:25.580]  They believe they own the middle class and they believe you're all fake pseudo-intellectuals that think you know everything and think you're invincible because you are gonna side with the power structure like every other jackass coward I ever knew.
[00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:33.384]  The only people that change things are people that have the will to know the truth and are all in for history and who believe in humanity.
[00:38:33.985 --> 00:38:34.185]  So!
[00:38:36.263 --> 00:38:38.864]  You don't need to give us a red ugly scent.
[00:38:39.204 --> 00:38:41.504]  All I want is to see leadership from you in action.
[00:38:41.824 --> 00:38:59.128]  But the clearest thing you can do to get water filters and non-general seeds and pro-patriot t-shirts to meet like-minded people and all the other nutraceuticals and things that are the very best products out there is go to Infowarsstore.com and to buy them and to support us because that is the ultimate symbol of energy.
[00:38:59.348 --> 00:39:03.949]  This IRS takes your money and uses it against you and your family and destroys free will.
[00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:06.009]  We simply say through free will
[00:39:06.189 --> 00:39:06.489]  I think?
[00:39:22.208 --> 00:39:40.959]  And I know, just as sure as I already watched this movie, that if you support us financially and pray for us and psychically give us your support and press your will through us at the enemy like a ruby laser against their heart, we will go to the next level and we will reach hundreds of millions a day, not millions and millions a day.
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.580]  And the enemy is scared.
[00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:43.241]  Good!
[00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:47.824]  Let them be scared and know that no matter how I smash into their wall,
[00:39:48.752 --> 00:39:54.874]  Like ripples in a pond, I know what we're doing, and I've always known, will lead to their downfall.
[00:39:55.434 --> 00:40:10.719]  But what is absolutely maximum is that in my resistance to them, when I ram up against them and finally hit the wall that's too strong, and I am destroyed and smashed, that my will completely blows a hole through for all the other energy of God to flow through.
[00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:17.201]  And that's what all of you have to believe in and understand now, that I want to be annihilated by the enemy.
[00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:21.405]  I want to run them over and explode and bring them down.
[00:40:22.205 --> 00:40:27.130]  You will never make it out of this frickin' world if you don't have that same attitude.
[00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.592]  These people think they have control.
[00:40:29.832 --> 00:40:31.013]  They think they've bullied you.
[00:40:31.193 --> 00:40:32.114]  They think you're weak.
[00:40:32.294 --> 00:40:33.335]  They think you're fallen.
[00:40:33.475 --> 00:40:34.997]  They think you're cowards like them.
[00:40:35.237 --> 00:40:37.359]  And it's up to you to show them the difference.
[00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:44.220]  Let's go to 940 with this Ask Me Anything from Reddit, which they're censoring the hell out of, and they want Reddit because it's so big they can't defeat them.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:44.741]  I don't know.
[00:40:44.761 --> 00:40:45.541]  Just do what we say.
[00:40:45.781 --> 00:40:46.201]  Be nice.
[00:40:46.241 --> 00:40:46.881]  Kind of shut up.
[00:40:47.101 --> 00:40:48.361]  Let us slowly censor you.
[00:40:48.561 --> 00:40:51.342]  Like everything else, we're supposed to just shut up, and it'll be okay.
[00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:51.602]  No!
[00:40:52.142 --> 00:40:54.583]  Forget Reddit if they want to censor Donald Trump.
[00:40:54.923 --> 00:40:55.763]  Create a new one.
[00:40:56.003 --> 00:40:58.204]  Go, like Drudge said, go create our own systems.
[00:40:58.484 --> 00:40:59.284]  But while we do it...
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.642]  Let them censor and pull everything away from them.
[00:41:02.662 --> 00:41:05.624]  Because let me give Google and Facebook and Reddit a little message.
[00:41:05.644 --> 00:41:09.287]  Because Drudge came out over a year ago and he said, don't be in these electronic ghettos.
[00:41:09.307 --> 00:41:10.168]  They'll shut you down later.
[00:41:10.208 --> 00:41:10.728]  And I knew that.
[00:41:10.748 --> 00:41:11.869]  I told Drudge privately on air.
[00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:15.332]  I said, we're reaching out to their slaves to wake them up.
[00:41:15.913 --> 00:41:17.514]  And we know these are enemy platforms.
[00:41:17.794 --> 00:41:24.320]  We're going to go in and dominate in those platforms of truth and bring people to us for this big war that's now happening.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.961]  Let's go to this Ask Me Anything.
[00:41:26.001 --> 00:41:26.542]  Go ahead, Buckley.
[00:41:27.142 --> 00:41:28.123]  All right, well here we go.
[00:41:28.183 --> 00:41:39.308]  The top question is by Metamuse and he asks, Alex, what is the biggest conspiracy that you would cover over the past couple of decades that even you thought couldn't be true but turned out to be real?
[00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:49.616]  Again, the media makes great headlines out of those, and I was somebody that, I wasn't like an atheist growing up, but I was so sick of going to church twice a week and, you know, oh yeah, a guy in the sky and all this.
[00:41:49.896 --> 00:41:54.099]  And then I studied the Globalist, I infiltrated Bohemian Grove, I covered Bohemian Grove, I studied the Clintons.
[00:41:54.459 --> 00:41:59.303]  They all are constantly in rituals and believe that they're communicating with interdimensional creatures.
[00:41:59.343 --> 00:42:01.744]  Whether it's true or not, this is in the news, whether it was...
[00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:06.492]  You know, Tony Blair and his wife, they get possessed by Lucifer every morning.
[00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:07.312]  That's in the news.
[00:42:08.193 --> 00:42:13.996]  And they get, like, the people that develop a lot of the sciences in the 1850s in England, they believe they were channeling all this.
[00:42:14.496 --> 00:42:16.637]  They believe that they've got to kill everybody.
[00:42:16.677 --> 00:42:17.398]  Let's get a shot of them.
[00:42:17.958 --> 00:42:19.659]  And then they'll get all the super technology.
[00:42:19.679 --> 00:42:21.140]  And I talk about that 20 years ago, people laughed.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.381]  Now that's what Ray Kurzweil says.
[00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:24.022]  You'll be destroyed if you don't do this.
[00:42:24.082 --> 00:42:27.965]  Or Elon Musk says, you know, if you don't merge the machines, you'll just be an obsolete.
[00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:36.531]  So the big enchilada is whether it's true or not, the psychopath's cosmology is don't have kids and live on through them forever.
[00:42:36.611 --> 00:42:38.032]  Don't be a good part of the human culture.
[00:42:38.352 --> 00:42:39.193]  Be so selfish.
[00:42:39.873 --> 00:42:56.250]  That whatever it is, a genetic mutation, mental illness, a demon, an interdimensional, you know, Jim Big Booty from Buckaroo Banzai, whatever it is, they are saying kill people, enslave them, hurt them, rob the Haitians, rob everyone, and you'll get ahead.
[00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:03.317]  Just prove you're evil, prove you're horrible, prove you're ready to slaughter your fellow humans, because they're a disease, you're a beautiful psychic missile,
[00:43:03.837 --> 00:43:06.841]  Sent to Earth to enslave everyone and stumble around.
[00:43:06.901 --> 00:43:10.206]  It's so beautiful how you're just this God killing everyone.
[00:43:10.606 --> 00:43:12.328]  And just it's so liberal, it's so loving.
[00:43:12.368 --> 00:43:14.491]  Just ban free speech, enslave everything.
[00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:15.913]  You're liberal, you're liberal.
[00:43:15.973 --> 00:43:17.215]  It's okay, liberal, liberal.
[00:43:17.535 --> 00:43:18.577]  That's basically the big secret.
[00:43:21.033 --> 00:43:21.994]  That's a hell of an answer.
[00:43:22.014 --> 00:43:22.474]  You like that?
[00:43:22.595 --> 00:43:22.995]  I love it.
[00:43:23.916 --> 00:43:29.941]  So, we obviously talked about this a lot on Pizzagate, but this is the second highest question, Bucks2000.
[00:43:30.241 --> 00:43:30.682]  Hold on!
[00:43:31.082 --> 00:43:35.326]  Last time I checked, Reddit blocks all Pizzagate leaks, so I agree with Reddit.
[00:43:36.127 --> 00:43:37.428]  No, you shouldn't say pizza.
[00:43:37.868 --> 00:43:43.393]  Or even red sauce, or even tamales, or even, you know, any type of food.
[00:43:43.894 --> 00:43:45.155]  Don't say eggs, don't say steak.
[00:43:45.435 --> 00:43:45.895]  Exactly.
[00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:47.377]  Because you know, did you see in the news?
[00:43:47.657 --> 00:43:49.199]  Detroit Free Press was like straight-faced.
[00:43:49.459 --> 00:43:53.043]  We're banning blackboards and whiteboards because people might write something offensive.
[00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:54.164]  They'll at least ban books.
[00:43:54.224 --> 00:43:55.145]  So, you know what?
[00:43:55.225 --> 00:43:56.026]  I agree with Reddit.
[00:43:56.887 --> 00:43:57.608]  The folks that run it.
[00:43:58.228 --> 00:43:59.710]  And I agree with AdRoll.
[00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.872]  The big, you know, New Age goofball there and everything.
[00:44:02.433 --> 00:44:03.494]  I think they should ban.
[00:44:03.554 --> 00:44:04.014]  I'm not kidding.
[00:44:04.114 --> 00:44:04.435]  There it is.
[00:44:05.433 --> 00:44:06.293]  Let's put it on screen.
[00:44:06.793 --> 00:44:10.014]  Detroit Free Press, they're banning whiteboards because they can be used for bullying.
[00:44:10.334 --> 00:44:12.915]  But your voice, you've got to cut your larynx out.
[00:44:12.935 --> 00:44:17.715]  We should do like a whole deal where I have a surgery and cut the larynx out and go, now you won't be racist.
[00:44:17.996 --> 00:44:19.736]  And actually, they think it was a real public service announcement.
[00:44:20.116 --> 00:44:22.556]  Liberals would go have their, because it's like liberals, oh yeah.
[00:44:22.576 --> 00:44:27.637]  It's like, pour bleach in your eyes in England, they have you taxpayer paid, but we have to pay for sex change.
[00:44:27.657 --> 00:44:29.618]  They don't give a shit about sex change, just I don't pay for it.
[00:44:29.658 --> 00:44:31.518]  It's like their fantasy is THX 1138.
[00:44:31.858 --> 00:44:33.879]  That's their fantasy.
[00:44:33.899 --> 00:44:34.679]  But you know, it's okay.
[00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.400]  You know, because they're the advanced intellectuals.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:45.426]  You know, they don't know the seven continents, they don't know basic stuff, but the university bans whiteboards, next level book burning.
[00:44:45.446 --> 00:44:53.951]  Now that's my video from today, but if you scroll down, there was an actual article with a straight face, Buckley, where they're saying ban the written words, what they're saying, because it could be hurtful.
[00:44:54.231 --> 00:44:54.692]  I read that.
[00:44:55.112 --> 00:45:00.295]  So Bucks2001 says, Mr. Jones, thank you for all your hard work in educating and enlightening the masses.
[00:45:00.335 --> 00:45:02.937]  Your commitment to defending liberty and fighting globalism is second to none.
[00:45:03.417 --> 00:45:06.939]  I credit InfoWars for helping me to become a more informed, politically active citizen.
[00:45:06.979 --> 00:45:07.779]  Here is my question.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.542]  In 2011, Andrew Breitbart tweeted about John Podesta's ties to pedophilia.
[00:45:13.002 --> 00:45:14.983]  However, at times, you have dismissed Pizzagate.
[00:45:15.023 --> 00:45:19.225]  Can you explain your thoughts on John Podesta, Comet Ping Pong, and pedophilia in Washington, D.C.?
[00:45:19.506 --> 00:45:20.526]  Okay, here's what happens.
[00:45:21.026 --> 00:45:22.667]  Can we Google the British Prime Minister?
[00:45:22.747 --> 00:45:24.908]  The top police chief just came out and said it was a pedophile.
[00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:26.689]  Like yesterday, or two days ago.
[00:45:26.709 --> 00:45:27.390]  This was on Monday.
[00:45:28.578 --> 00:45:29.719]  This is what the media does.
[00:45:29.959 --> 00:45:36.967]  They take when you're on a show three, four hours a day, today it'll be like seven hours, and I go, hey, I get people's point.
[00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:43.193]  I can see how you could believe that no one was killed at Sandy Hook.
[00:45:44.227 --> 00:45:46.589]  And that basically it was all actors, it was fake.
[00:45:47.169 --> 00:45:50.592]  Because of what we saw with other fake things they've staged in the blue screen.
[00:45:50.972 --> 00:45:53.694]  They take that and just say, I said it didn't happen.
[00:45:53.734 --> 00:46:00.619]  When I had debates on air, with sides saying it all happened, it didn't happen, they're so dishonest, they'll misrepresent.
[00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:09.025]  So, over 10,000 of the hundreds of thousands of emails come out of Podesta, and it's like, we're gonna have the kids delivered to the hot tub for your pleasure.
[00:46:10.014 --> 00:46:14.841]  You know, they're ages 6, 8, 9, and they're, you know, they're kids, but they're gonna give you, you know, they're gonna do your entertainment.
[00:46:15.162 --> 00:46:16.684]  They'll be waiting in that hot tub for you.
[00:46:17.665 --> 00:46:19.508]  Obama wants $65,000 of hot dogs.
[00:46:19.568 --> 00:46:21.211]  Oh God, they're so succulent.
[00:46:22.225 --> 00:46:25.467]  And actually, to Obama's credit, that's gay prostitutes, so at least it's adults.
[00:46:25.527 --> 00:46:29.010]  It's like, please just don't rape kids, you know.
[00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:30.411]  So we don't find anything about Obama with that.
[00:46:30.891 --> 00:46:37.775]  And it just goes into this, you know, and then the Podesta's brother is like, we like DeviantArt, and it's like paddled naked kids in his house.
[00:46:38.076 --> 00:46:41.518]  This is the Washington Post, because the highest power for them is to throw it in your face.
[00:46:41.738 --> 00:46:44.500]  It's lesser magic, you know, for the vampires in people.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:46.922]  It's a psychic vampirism to throw it in your face.
[00:46:47.722 --> 00:46:53.336]  Everybody then goes, I saw Washington Post, CNN, New York Times, all one day, about a week into this, right after the election, they go...
[00:46:54.622 --> 00:46:55.142]  Pizzagate.
[00:46:55.162 --> 00:46:57.463]  They found some little link to somebody saying pizza pizza.
[00:46:58.164 --> 00:46:58.784]  You know, in there.
[00:46:58.844 --> 00:47:01.986]  And they went, oh there's a place with David Brock's boyfriend in D.C.
[00:47:02.006 --> 00:47:02.686]  that Podesta goes to.
[00:47:02.726 --> 00:47:03.266]  Everyone's focused.
[00:47:03.286 --> 00:47:04.887]  It was like some little comment in a thread.
[00:47:05.167 --> 00:47:06.028]  Like 20 comments.
[00:47:06.888 --> 00:47:08.109]  And I went, whoa, to the crew.
[00:47:08.129 --> 00:47:09.089]  Everybody's like, shut up Alex.
[00:47:09.129 --> 00:47:09.950]  Don't try to cover up.
[00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:10.850]  The crew's really liked him.
[00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.991]  They're like, oh the crew's like, Jones, we're going to expose this.
[00:47:13.011 --> 00:47:13.892]  Why aren't you going to expose it?
[00:47:13.912 --> 00:47:17.413]  And I said, I said, listen, the media's focusing on this place.
[00:47:17.433 --> 00:47:18.454]  I don't believe there's a basement.
[00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:19.515]  I don't believe it's happening.
[00:47:19.535 --> 00:47:20.215]  You know, it's creepy.
[00:47:20.855 --> 00:47:22.716]  Because there's all this other confirmed stuff.
[00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:24.257]  They've got to have something discreet.
[00:47:25.715 --> 00:47:26.718]  And I said, but you know what?
[00:47:28.584 --> 00:47:31.232]  You know, just don't sit there and agree with stuff on the web.
[00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:31.853]  You want to cover it?
[00:47:31.893 --> 00:47:32.295]  That's fine.
[00:47:33.143 --> 00:47:35.363]  And then it just went so far, and it was clearly a cover-up.
[00:47:35.824 --> 00:47:39.564]  And I came in, even before the news attacked me, and I said, I'm going to be attacked for this.
[00:47:39.764 --> 00:47:40.424]  I can see that.
[00:47:40.444 --> 00:47:41.125]  I can just feel it.
[00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.165]  And I said, delete all these videos.
[00:47:43.205 --> 00:47:45.105]  They're like, but they're not fake.
[00:47:45.585 --> 00:47:57.148]  And I went, yeah, but you're not covering, like I told you two weeks ago, all the admitted FBI code words for pedophilia and small children and sex and prostitutes, which is admitted.
[00:47:57.188 --> 00:47:58.188]  It's clearly going on.
[00:47:59.008 --> 00:47:59.808]  Don't you get it?
[00:48:00.068 --> 00:48:01.629]  And I'm not mad at the crew, just some people.
[00:48:01.649 --> 00:48:01.949]  And I get it.
[00:48:01.969 --> 00:48:02.709]  It was hysteria.
[00:48:02.989 --> 00:48:04.129]  The audience was demanding it.
[00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:05.329]  Why am I covering it up?
[00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:16.552]  And then months later, it's, you know, the info babe, Megyn Kelly, playing a clip of me saying, I don't know if Hillary really kills kids at this pizza place.
[00:48:16.592 --> 00:48:17.412]  I don't believe it, you know.
[00:48:17.752 --> 00:48:23.393]  But I went on to say, she kills them by funding ISIS, that is a satanic group murdering kids all over and selling them into slavery.
[00:48:23.413 --> 00:48:25.634]  And personally, she's funding groups that torture and murder.
[00:48:25.894 --> 00:48:26.994]  They edited it together.
[00:48:28.018 --> 00:48:32.019]  And then Megyn Kelly put it up, and I remember calling Fox, and it was more than that.
[00:48:32.099 --> 00:48:33.340]  She just, she quit right after that.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:38.422]  I'm not saying we did that, she destroyed herself, but... And then she had them on like, Alex wants people to kill you.
[00:48:38.442 --> 00:48:43.504]  And the guy's like, I know, it's horrible, he said that we personally murdered them in the basement.
[00:48:44.184 --> 00:48:44.664]  Never said it.
[00:48:45.504 --> 00:48:55.528]  So, I was like, the audience wouldn't listen, a lot of the crew listened, some wouldn't, and I knew we were being sucked into something, so I had to say, look,
[00:48:57.205 --> 00:49:01.548]  I was told by NYPD that Meaners is going to get busses for child porn.
[00:49:01.608 --> 00:49:02.329]  Came out months later.
[00:49:02.929 --> 00:49:05.271]  I've been told it's all over the country and Trump's going to go after it.
[00:49:05.311 --> 00:49:05.751]  It's happening.
[00:49:06.111 --> 00:49:08.713]  I've been told the network is in Pennsylvania and LA.
[00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:10.814]  Notice those huge busses in Sandusky Sun.
[00:49:11.355 --> 00:49:14.117]  I went on and said there's a big bus coming once Trump gets in.
[00:49:14.517 --> 00:49:15.458]  This is a big fight.
[00:49:15.518 --> 00:49:16.599]  It's how they control people.
[00:49:16.979 --> 00:49:17.859]  And all that happened.
[00:49:17.939 --> 00:49:18.840]  So now it's back.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.701]  But I just can't sit here.
[00:49:20.741 --> 00:49:22.683]  They tried to sucker us in and they almost got us.
[00:49:23.953 --> 00:49:24.193]  We're good
[00:49:42.381 --> 00:49:43.061]  People going, really?
[00:49:43.101 --> 00:49:43.522]  Hookers?
[00:49:43.582 --> 00:49:44.282]  I'm down to kids?
[00:49:44.302 --> 00:49:48.524]  You know, I'm kind of... Podesta's like being almost, as one of the CIA sources said, forced into it.
[00:49:48.544 --> 00:49:50.085]  I'm not saying it's okay what he did.
[00:49:50.486 --> 00:49:53.327]  But, you know, that's light years worse than Milo, reportedly.
[00:49:53.407 --> 00:49:56.569]  And then Milo's down there just admitting he got raped and inducted into this cult.
[00:49:56.589 --> 00:49:57.610]  They're saying, oh, he's a pedophile.
[00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:58.530]  No, he was raped.
[00:49:59.090 --> 00:49:59.231]  So...
[00:50:00.612 --> 00:50:17.202]  Imagine this is your pay grade you're in, where you've got a deal with all this, and everybody's obsessed with it, and I'm about to go on Joe Rogan's show, he asked me about it, I bring that up, his show, highest watched ever, biggest podcast in history, forty-something million views, they block it off Facebook, Twitter, Google for a week, till he freaks out.
[00:50:17.983 --> 00:50:21.445]  And they finally have the Streisand effect, where they're like, okay, we can't block it.
[00:50:21.505 --> 00:50:22.285]  Well, then...
[00:50:23.356 --> 00:50:25.460]  We had $3.3 million on Google last year.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.201]  It sounds like a lot of money.
[00:50:26.442 --> 00:50:28.425]  That doesn't fund the bandwidth for a year.
[00:50:28.586 --> 00:50:28.846]  Okay.
[00:50:30.008 --> 00:50:30.810]  IT for a year.
[00:50:31.451 --> 00:50:32.192]  I need that money.
[00:50:32.212 --> 00:50:32.974]  $3 million is like $200,000 in 1980.
[00:50:37.062 --> 00:50:39.943]  They come and hit us and say, you're fake news, you're hurtful, you're banned.
[00:50:40.463 --> 00:50:44.204]  I'm here trying to report accurately what's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:50:44.724 --> 00:50:50.386]  I don't go all the way saying it's all this rape and devil worship, even though they're at Aleister Crowley meetings admitting it's devil worship.
[00:50:50.666 --> 00:50:53.507]  No one focuses on the real thing, and then we're being shut down.
[00:50:53.587 --> 00:50:55.347]  So everybody wants us to do this.
[00:50:55.767 --> 00:50:56.188]  I get it.
[00:50:56.488 --> 00:50:59.288]  But, you know, what are we supposed to do?
[00:50:59.529 --> 00:51:00.489]  You don't see Sean Hannity.
[00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:01.389]  I'm not bashing Hannity.
[00:51:01.969 --> 00:51:02.889]  He's not one of them, I don't think.
[00:51:02.909 --> 00:51:04.290]  But the point is, we're not here.
[00:51:05.694 --> 00:51:09.605]  To like just be able to just run off and just make crap up.
[00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:14.794]  And then meanwhile, we can put it up, the British Prime Minister, top police chief says he's a pedophile.
[00:51:15.174 --> 00:51:16.415]  I talked about that 15 years ago.
[00:51:16.896 --> 00:51:18.837]  All this stuff with Jimmy Savelle, all this stuff comes out.
[00:51:19.258 --> 00:51:21.139]  Sandusky, all the real pedophile comes out.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.681]  All the real pedophile reports.
[00:51:22.741 --> 00:51:23.401]  Nobody cares!
[00:51:24.002 --> 00:51:25.183]  People don't care if I cover that.
[00:51:25.363 --> 00:51:37.593]  They love some nebulous pizza place in a basement that doesn't exist because the New York Times went, the crazies think there's something in this pizza place and then sicked everyone on it to make that the big
[00:51:38.314 --> 00:51:38.734]  Diversion.
[00:51:38.754 --> 00:51:40.616]  Yeah, but it was also like in major British newspapers.
[00:51:40.636 --> 00:51:40.996]  There it is.
[00:51:41.337 --> 00:51:42.057]  UK police chief.
[00:51:42.317 --> 00:51:43.999]  Foreign British PM was huge pedophile.
[00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:47.942]  Well, let me tell you what I was told about that.
[00:51:48.002 --> 00:51:48.463]  Let's scroll down.
[00:51:48.483 --> 00:51:49.503]  I'll read the article for folks.
[00:51:49.964 --> 00:51:51.025]  Look at those shark eyes, man.
[00:51:52.219 --> 00:51:56.282]  In four weeks since Donald Trump's inauguration, there have been a record number of human trafficking arrests.
[00:51:56.622 --> 00:51:57.383]  Who broke all this?
[00:51:57.403 --> 00:51:57.623]  See?
[00:51:57.944 --> 00:51:58.484]  I'm not bragging.
[00:51:58.504 --> 00:51:59.585]  We told you this before the election.
[00:52:00.045 --> 00:52:01.786]  Including the largest bust in U.S.
[00:52:01.807 --> 00:52:06.010]  history, which received virtually no MSM attention.
[00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:14.877]  1,500 suspects have been taken down, hundreds of kids caught in slave dungeons, including high-profiled serial child molester Jerry Sandusky's adopted son, who was a procurer, reportedly.
[00:52:15.757 --> 00:52:19.660]  Jerry Sandusky was arrested a week ago on charges of sexually assaulting two
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.140]  I don't know.
[00:52:30.003 --> 00:52:31.083]  Then all this happens.
[00:52:31.103 --> 00:52:32.404]  Let's get the Prime Minister.
[00:52:32.864 --> 00:52:34.584]  The investigation into Sir Edward.
[00:52:34.604 --> 00:52:35.305]  Yeah, it's down there.
[00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:35.985]  It's down there.
[00:52:36.645 --> 00:52:37.365]  Thanks, you guys are great.
[00:52:37.385 --> 00:52:41.587]  The investigator Sir Edward, called Operation Conifer, was set up in 2015.
[00:52:42.487 --> 00:52:44.587]  British intelligence wants to bust these people.
[00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:46.268]  Most of them aren't pedophiles.
[00:52:46.668 --> 00:52:52.270]  You know, people will do some corrupt stuff, but when you start talking about grabbing kids, raping kids, and killing kids.
[00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:53.090]  So let me explain.
[00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:58.872]  The Renfields grab kids, the goblins I call them, I've introduced people to that term,
[00:53:00.393 --> 00:53:01.394]  They just want to rape them.
[00:53:02.375 --> 00:53:04.556]  The vampires want to drink their blood.
[00:53:05.197 --> 00:53:09.060]  And that sounds crazy, but in all the devil worship, when the stuff comes out, that's what they do.
[00:53:10.632 --> 00:53:24.026]  In all, Savelle is believed to have abused 500 girls and boys, some as young as 2, between 13 and 15, as well as callous adults, with unfettered access to Leeds General Infirmary, where he raped the children, including dead ones.
[00:53:24.447 --> 00:53:29.432]  Service said reporting he raped and fondled boys, girls, and women in offices and corridors.
[00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:32.035]  He officially committed sexual acts on dead bodies.
[00:53:33.308 --> 00:53:35.770]  And they found his whole satanic command base.
[00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:45.657]  I was told by members of high-level BBC broadcasting that they wouldn't join this because they weren't just raping the kids.
[00:53:45.798 --> 00:53:50.101]  They would put plastic out and bring like a five-year-old girl they kidnapped in.
[00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:51.322]  And this was almost on a daily basis.
[00:53:53.243 --> 00:53:56.426]  And then they would slit her throat and then the British Prime Minister
[00:53:57.998 --> 00:53:58.538]  Would do this.
[00:53:58.638 --> 00:54:01.880]  Now, again, we're not supposed to tell you about this.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.062]  We're just supposed to sit here and then like, oh, shut up, Alex.
[00:54:05.262 --> 00:54:06.342]  The internet will always be free.
[00:54:06.382 --> 00:54:06.843]  It'll be there.
[00:54:07.083 --> 00:54:09.044]  No, they just said it's for $5 million.
[00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:10.525]  They go, what is it?
[00:54:10.545 --> 00:54:11.125]  $5 million or $3.3 million?
[00:54:11.145 --> 00:54:14.787]  $3.3 million last year, $5 million on the graph this year.
[00:54:15.007 --> 00:54:19.990]  That is the money we have to be able to continue and have a cushion and expand.
[00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:23.772]  The point is, that's why you should flood us, everyone watching.
[00:54:24.548 --> 00:54:27.212]  You should go buy Super Metal Vitality and experience what it does.
[00:54:27.452 --> 00:54:29.234]  If it doesn't work for you, you don't lose anything, it's great.
[00:54:29.374 --> 00:54:30.836]  But I want you to take it because you'll love it!
[00:54:31.618 --> 00:54:35.280]  We have a five point, four point eight, you know, reviews on third-party sites.
[00:54:35.701 --> 00:54:36.901]  Get Brain Force.
[00:54:37.022 --> 00:54:38.222]  Get X2.
[00:54:38.402 --> 00:54:40.724]  Get Caveman, Bone Broth, Turmeric.
[00:54:40.884 --> 00:54:41.404]  Incredible.
[00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:42.145]  Talk about whey.
[00:54:42.165 --> 00:54:43.226]  This is 20 times better.
[00:54:43.566 --> 00:54:45.207]  Get the storable foods with the free water filter.
[00:54:45.567 --> 00:54:45.867]  Get it!
[00:54:45.947 --> 00:54:46.728]  Just flood us!
[00:54:46.928 --> 00:54:58.255]  Listen, if you want us to be kamikazes against these people and hit pay dirt and expose them, and I told you there'd be mass pedophile roundups three months ago, and it's all happening like I told you, then realize, yes, I'm a maniac.
[00:54:58.496 --> 00:55:00.437]  Yes, I don't come off like some quaffed
[00:55:00.777 --> 00:55:04.420]  You know, you know, organized, focused asshole that thinks he's better than everybody.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:05.120]  I'm real.
[00:55:05.561 --> 00:55:07.522]  I am, I have been up since 6 a.m.
[00:55:07.602 --> 00:55:07.943]  fighting.
[00:55:08.303 --> 00:55:10.124]  I am turning everything over I've got.
[00:55:10.144 --> 00:55:12.266]  I am turning my will over to five of these people.
[00:55:12.626 --> 00:55:16.810]  I have a family that it can be, you know, you won't even know what's going on behind the scenes.
[00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:18.911]  And then, don't worry, God's on our side.
[00:55:18.931 --> 00:55:19.532]  It'll be dealt with.
[00:55:20.708 --> 00:55:24.591]  But the forces of evil have literally crawled up out of hell to stop us.
[00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:26.432]  And we're going to defeat them.
[00:55:26.652 --> 00:55:36.959]  But yes, you should take every article and every video, and every day you're allowed to share links, as God said, because the censorship worldwide against everybody is intensifying.
[00:55:36.999 --> 00:55:46.805]  Everybody in the conservative, libertarian, or nationalist, or virile movement, like Breitbart or Daily Caller having their stuff taken away, and I've talked to them, they're too strong.
[00:55:46.825 --> 00:55:49.687]  They'll, well, we'll just figure something else out, or we'll try to work it out.
[00:55:49.707 --> 00:55:49.767]  No!
[00:55:50.928 --> 00:55:58.531]  That's the problem with patriots or men that are masculine who aren't pedophiles, is that we sit there and take this crap instead of saying, help us!
[00:55:59.031 --> 00:55:59.451]  Help us!
[00:55:59.511 --> 00:56:00.412]  You want us to help you?
[00:56:00.632 --> 00:56:00.932]  Help us!
[00:56:00.952 --> 00:56:03.813]  Listen, listen, I have a responsibility to beat these people.
[00:56:04.173 --> 00:56:05.313]  I hate seeing them win.
[00:56:05.593 --> 00:56:06.834]  I hate seeing them get away with this.
[00:56:06.914 --> 00:56:07.554]  I hate seeing it.
[00:56:07.854 --> 00:56:09.055]  My flesh wants to quit.
[00:56:09.835 --> 00:56:13.956]  You think I want to run this big monster, and involve in all this, and put myself in this position?
[00:56:13.976 --> 00:56:14.717]  But here's the thing.
[00:56:14.737 --> 00:56:24.100]  Those kids demanded, those children demanded, and everybody now knows, from Breitbart to Drudge to Zero Hedge, they all heard me lay it out, they all know the intel's real.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.240]  I told you Hillary was collapsing every 30 minutes.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.361]  We caught it on tape.
[00:56:27.841 --> 00:56:29.561]  Milley was there, and we have it all.
[00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:31.622]  Let me tell you something.
[00:56:31.902 --> 00:56:32.662]  We're there, folks.
[00:56:32.702 --> 00:56:34.763]  We have the former Intelligence Committee people calling us.
[00:56:34.983 --> 00:56:35.923]  They've been on just yesterday.
[00:56:36.183 --> 00:56:37.664]  We have the Zeitgeists, because
[00:56:38.624 --> 00:56:40.667]  In a world of cowards, there's still some men left.
[00:56:40.687 --> 00:56:42.008]  And I don't say that with pleasure.
[00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:47.575]  Like, oh look, I'm this big man, willing to die, willing to go to the mattresses, willing to fight to the death.
[00:56:47.815 --> 00:56:49.397]  Look at me, I'm the best man here!
[00:56:49.877 --> 00:56:54.343]  We got in this position because men stopped being men and stopped admitting evil existed.
[00:56:54.763 --> 00:56:56.045]  So, Infowarsstore.com
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:19.597]  You know, quite frankly, $500,000, we made a million dollars the last day, $500,000 of it is, quote, profit, when we're already three, four million dollars behind because of these criminals and all their slimy shit, because we're not, excuse me, because we're not even supposed to be able to put an ad on the internet they own and control, because we're fake, because we don't sit there and grab kids out of backyards and rape them and then cut their throats.
[00:57:20.297 --> 00:57:22.960]  See, see, we're fake, because we see who they are.
[00:57:24.501 --> 00:57:24.601]  So,
[00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:28.582]  That's the big warning I've gotten.
[00:57:28.742 --> 00:57:29.042]  All of it.
[00:57:29.102 --> 00:57:29.823]  Just shut up.
[00:57:30.183 --> 00:57:30.703]  Go away.
[00:57:30.964 --> 00:57:32.565]  Trump's been told, shut up, go away.
[00:57:32.845 --> 00:57:36.347]  Let Jerry Epstein and his Lolita Express and the Clintons sit there and do it.
[00:57:36.467 --> 00:57:36.708]  Hey!
[00:57:39.069 --> 00:57:40.390]  You're not going to get off people's backs.
[00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:42.712]  You're not going to take the scalps you already got and take that as enough.
[00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:43.692]  You're never going to stop.
[00:57:44.693 --> 00:57:46.754]  So, you want to bang heads.
[00:57:47.115 --> 00:57:48.396]  And so that's what this is.
[00:57:49.264 --> 00:57:54.588]  The thing is, is that I'm like an inanimate corpse without the prayers and support of listeners.
[00:57:55.088 --> 00:58:01.452]  And so my soul wants to fight them, but when you pray, when you financially support us, when you spread the links, it raises up my arm.
[00:58:01.732 --> 00:58:05.735]  And when you get enraged and focused with God's strength, then I get animated.
[00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:09.057]  Then, just like Trump, I can fire-breathe against the enemy.
[00:58:09.417 --> 00:58:10.118]  But only then!
[00:58:11.295 --> 00:58:13.596]  Only then you are the strength.
[00:58:13.996 --> 00:58:19.637]  You have the will, but you have to decide it's not just entertainment and you're in the arena and you're taking action.
[00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:21.198]  Let's go for like a long time.
[00:58:21.218 --> 00:58:21.738]  Let's take calls.
[00:58:21.758 --> 00:58:21.978]  Go ahead.
[00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:23.498]  I mean, let's take these questions.
[00:58:23.779 --> 00:58:24.459]  I want to get to these.
[00:58:24.999 --> 00:58:25.579]  We're live.
[00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:32.021]  We're doing a 13 hour live broadcast till midnight central because we're being hit and everybody else is hit and they're all scared, I've learned.
[00:58:33.244 --> 00:58:37.668]  You know, everybody that drudge is scared to talk about the censorship, and I'm not trying to laud drudge, he's the one.
[00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:42.032]  There's not many men around here, which makes me feel like a bucket of crap, man.
[00:58:42.473 --> 00:58:43.654]  I want to be surrounded by men.
[00:58:43.734 --> 00:58:45.475]  I want bigger men than me to stand up for me.
[00:58:45.756 --> 00:58:47.017]  I'm tired of having to do this.
[00:58:47.517 --> 00:58:48.298]  I'm tired of it.
[00:58:49.628 --> 00:58:50.309]  I'm tired.
[00:58:50.389 --> 00:58:51.830]  I want some real men to stand up.
[00:58:52.031 --> 00:58:52.711]  Where are you?
[00:58:53.212 --> 00:58:53.793]  Where are you?
[00:58:53.833 --> 00:58:54.613]  What you gonna do?
[00:58:55.234 --> 00:58:56.235]  I've been doing this a while.
[00:58:56.255 --> 00:58:59.358]  I've been running up against a bunch of the most evil people there are.
[00:59:00.039 --> 00:59:01.321]  You think that's fun psychically?
[00:59:01.921 --> 00:59:02.502]  But you know what?
[00:59:02.842 --> 00:59:07.988]  I think about the children and I've got unlimited strength after that, but it makes me sick to see how asleep people are.
[00:59:08.368 --> 00:59:08.668]  Go ahead.
[00:59:09.449 --> 00:59:13.753]  Okay, so Nala Spy says, hello Mr. Jones, long time listener, first time caller.
[00:59:14.513 --> 00:59:15.294]  Two questions for you.
[00:59:15.394 --> 00:59:19.398]  Any plans on getting an Infowars person in the White House press briefing room for daily briefings?
[00:59:19.818 --> 00:59:24.002]  And second, do you think Evan McMuffin is behind the leaking and inquisition of Milo?
[00:59:26.884 --> 00:59:29.226]  You're talking about the CIA scumbag out of Utah?
[00:59:31.208 --> 00:59:32.469]  I mean, that guy, just look at him.
[00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.111]  He's everything we stand against.
[00:59:35.191 --> 00:59:35.752]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:59:37.283 --> 00:59:39.564]  His boss came out and said Trump better watch his mouth.
[00:59:41.845 --> 00:59:42.626]  That guy's a puppet.
[00:59:42.986 --> 00:59:44.146]  What was the first question?
[00:59:44.166 --> 00:59:47.608]  First question was any plans on getting an Infowars person in the White House press brief?
[00:59:47.648 --> 00:59:55.391]  Yeah, you know how this works is they turn everything into a big event like we need to get a White House press pass so we then finally matter.
[00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:58.753]  So first like we're junior and when you get that you'll be big.
[00:59:59.113 --> 01:00:03.155]  The danger is that we put people in the White House and they don't do their job then we've lost our soul.
[01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:06.150]  So it's not cool to be in Washington.
[01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:08.572]  It's not cool to be up front asking the questions.
[01:00:08.992 --> 01:00:19.038]  But we have a responsibility, if we have people like Jerome Corsi, three-time number one New York Times bestseller journalist, fought NAFTA, fought GATT like nobody else, other than Ron Paul, you know, it's an honor to have him.
[01:00:20.379 --> 01:00:26.463]  And so, I'm in D.C., you're there, we're there, I get run into by Trump people, and they say, oh, we love Paul Watson, he used to be the White House correspondent.
[01:00:26.883 --> 01:00:29.304]  And I call Paul, this is my life, you want the whole full story?
[01:00:29.324 --> 01:00:33.027]  Because there is no, like, angle or spin, it's what happened.
[01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:34.931]  People always want something to spin.
[01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.312]  Listeners get the fact they're just getting what happened.
[01:00:37.612 --> 01:00:39.093]  Figure out what you want out of it, because I don't even know.
[01:00:40.153 --> 01:00:44.234]  So, I talked to some of the senior Trump people that I just run into.
[01:00:44.314 --> 01:00:45.935]  I'm recognizing them from TV.
[01:00:46.095 --> 01:00:54.037]  They're like, oh, we like you, but we really want Paul Watson, because they get viral with the youth, you know, absolutely dominant, good-looking, 6'3", you know, we want Paul Watson.
[01:00:55.003 --> 01:00:55.763]  So I go, okay, yeah.
[01:00:55.783 --> 01:00:57.204]  So I call Paul, get back Sunday.
[01:00:57.764 --> 01:00:58.724]  Come back Saturday, call him Sunday.
[01:00:58.744 --> 01:01:00.324]  He goes, I don't want to go.
[01:01:00.344 --> 01:01:02.245]  My girlfriend lives here in London.
[01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.485]  London Bureau, London Bureau.
[01:01:03.765 --> 01:01:06.226]  So number one, what, it's not like I'm trying to get them.
[01:01:06.286 --> 01:01:07.706]  What they want is already unavailable.
[01:01:08.326 --> 01:01:10.307]  Because I don't enslave people and order people to do stuff.
[01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:11.707]  Paul's working 18 hours a day.
[01:01:11.727 --> 01:01:14.888]  So I say, okay, um, all right.
[01:01:15.348 --> 01:01:18.749]  So I get to show up at the office and people are running around going, we want to be here, we want to be here.
[01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:20.610]  I'm like, there has to be a process.
[01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:21.630]  We have to have an office there.
[01:01:22.363 --> 01:01:23.804]  And then stuff goes on without me knowing.
[01:01:23.824 --> 01:01:27.125]  Somebody files it, they don't live there yet, and then that comes back.
[01:01:27.165 --> 01:01:28.606]  And then, of course, he's filing.
[01:01:28.946 --> 01:01:29.666]  He's moved there.
[01:01:30.066 --> 01:01:31.227]  They're like, well, we have two filings.
[01:01:31.247 --> 01:01:32.708]  So the news goes, Jones is lying.
[01:01:33.088 --> 01:01:34.248]  He was refused his credentials.
[01:01:34.268 --> 01:01:36.709]  And the White House goes, no, we've not got him yet.
[01:01:36.749 --> 01:01:37.189]  We're waiting.
[01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:40.211]  So the answer is, A, we don't need them.
[01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:44.253]  B, it's kind of a responsibility, even if the optics aren't what we want.
[01:01:44.753 --> 01:01:45.853]  Spiritually, we're pure.
[01:01:45.913 --> 01:01:49.355]  So, sure, get somebody in there, which they're horrified of.
[01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:51.396]  So then I think, oh, my God, this actually makes sense.
[01:01:52.159 --> 01:01:54.489]  I mean, of course she's been friends with Trump 42 years.
[01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:55.996]  They did business deals together.
[01:01:56.196 --> 01:01:56.678]  They met!
[01:01:57.941 --> 01:02:01.003]  Late last year, when he was president-elect, I mean, they had dinner.
[01:02:01.063 --> 01:02:05.945]  I mean, it's like, they're sitting there acting like, you know, but again, it's all about Trump being blocked by everybody, you see?
[01:02:06.585 --> 01:02:09.566]  He's got to sneak off to Mar-a-Lago to even try to call people.
[01:02:09.986 --> 01:02:10.747]  Well, let's leave it at that.
[01:02:11.547 --> 01:02:15.629]  And so, it's not like I'm waiting, oh, the problem is I'm not actually keeping my phone on me.
[01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:16.809]  They had the big news, I was thinking of that.
[01:02:17.229 --> 01:02:19.070]  It's like, it's that Trump's good.
[01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:21.791]  If he was a president, I wouldn't care if he was a globalist.
[01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:25.673]  If we didn't have a beachhead in D.C., I wouldn't want an office there.
[01:02:27.213 --> 01:02:37.982]  But yeah, we're looking at like a $2,500 a month, two-room thing, with access to a bathroom for a few reporters in, with kind of a window of Pennsylvania Avenue, one with his White House is like 10 grand a month.
[01:02:38.282 --> 01:02:38.822]  You've been looking.
[01:02:38.842 --> 01:02:41.665]  And here we are like, where's your D.C.
[01:02:41.785 --> 01:02:42.025]  office?
[01:02:42.085 --> 01:02:50.031]  And I'm like, well, I already hired a guy and sent him there, and he's trying to hire people and we're trying to get office space, and I just got blown to hell for $5 million.
[01:02:51.192 --> 01:02:52.814]  So, you know, that's what I mean.
[01:02:52.834 --> 01:02:54.376]  Like, this ain't free, folks.
[01:02:54.636 --> 01:02:55.517]  This is a real war.
[01:02:55.577 --> 01:02:56.538]  We get on airplanes.
[01:02:56.578 --> 01:02:57.919]  We go to Bilderberg.
[01:02:58.139 --> 01:02:59.421]  We go out and get attacked.
[01:02:59.481 --> 01:03:02.524]  We go out and get beat up trying to get into the inauguration.
[01:03:02.544 --> 01:03:04.166]  And I'm not bitching, but here's the deal.
[01:03:04.286 --> 01:03:05.948]  We bring victory to cyberspace.
[01:03:06.488 --> 01:03:08.310]  We bring victory to Trump and Americana.
[01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:10.973]  But listen, the war is only intensifying.
[01:03:11.253 --> 01:03:12.535]  And that isn't to keep our audience.
[01:03:13.939 --> 01:03:16.960]  I told people privately when Trump got elected, I said, I fear this is going to be a lot worse.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  The war is about to really start.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.981]  They're going to come out in the open and they're going to attack us and censor us.
[01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:25.863]  They've already announced that they're going to go ahead with Hillary's plan because they've got the government and they're going to block Trump.
[01:03:26.863 --> 01:03:31.965]  And we can either decide to kind of collapse and just survive or really take them on.
[01:03:31.985 --> 01:03:32.745]  They're going to come after us.
[01:03:33.425 --> 01:03:35.847]  And I made the decision to go after the enemy 110%.
[01:03:36.948 --> 01:03:42.272]  And they went, you're not, they just opened the gates up of harassment and you name it, okay?
[01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:43.954]  And I'm not bitching, but here's the deal.
[01:03:44.174 --> 01:03:49.698]  This isn't a movie, folks, where your champion's in the arena fighting somebody and you're kind of watching it and it's Hollywood.
[01:03:49.999 --> 01:03:51.340]  This is real, okay?
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.361]  This is real.
[01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:54.442]  We're trying to stop World War III.
[01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:56.143]  We're trying to stop the Islamic invasion.
[01:03:56.323 --> 01:03:58.005]  We're trying to cut taxes to poor people.
[01:03:58.265 --> 01:04:03.008]  We're trying to cut the banking control that small banks can't loan to local businesses.
[01:04:03.689 --> 01:04:07.751]  Trump already, we're already at 1984 numbers just in a month, just in five weeks.
[01:04:07.852 --> 01:04:09.553]  I mean, that's why they're shitting their pants.
[01:04:09.573 --> 01:04:15.977]  We've never had somebody that understood it like this with patriots in the government who are fighting so hard.
[01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:18.039]  And that's why I'm so in.
[01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:22.172]  I see countless articles every day.
[01:04:22.252 --> 01:04:24.375]  Oh, Jones is now the establishment.
[01:04:25.175 --> 01:04:25.436]  Really?
[01:04:25.536 --> 01:04:30.801]  If Trump had control of everything, was actually getting his agenda through, and then did us wrong, I will go completely ape.
[01:04:31.622 --> 01:04:32.242]  That's not happening.
[01:04:33.263 --> 01:04:35.446]  He's completely surrounded, under attack.
[01:04:35.466 --> 01:04:40.070]  They're on all the news channels saying, kill him, overthrow him.
[01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:43.233]  Let's play Maxine Waters that thinks Russia two weeks ago invaded Korea.
[01:04:44.662 --> 01:04:53.027]  Russia invaded the moon, Russia invaded the United States, Russia invaded Timbuktu, Russia invaded Mars, Pluto, the Kuiper Belt.
[01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.788]  But again, you think, well the elite must be dumb.
[01:04:55.828 --> 01:04:58.930]  No, that's who they put in charge who don't know what planet they're on.
[01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:02.251]  Like Pelosi thinks Bush is still in office.
[01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:03.092]  Eight years later.
[01:05:03.912 --> 01:05:04.833]  Eight years and two months.
[01:05:05.533 --> 01:05:06.614]  So here's Maxine Waters.
[01:05:08.157 --> 01:05:10.619]  He had more resources than he ever used.
[01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:37.538]  This is a bunch of scumbags.
[01:05:38.018 --> 01:05:39.019]  That's what they are.
[01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:41.321]  Those are very strong words, Congresswoman.
[01:05:41.341 --> 01:05:42.983]  Who are all organized around making money.
[01:05:43.043 --> 01:05:44.764]  Who do you mean by that when you call them scumbags?
[01:05:44.784 --> 01:05:45.825]  Who are you talking about?
[01:05:45.925 --> 01:05:54.273]  All of these people who are organized with these oil and gas interests that's in the administration and friends of the President of the United States.
[01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:56.274]  This back-channeling that you see.
[01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:57.756]  These are a bunch of scumbags.
[01:05:57.796 --> 01:05:58.296]  That's what they are.
[01:05:58.316 --> 01:06:00.298]  Secretary of State, you mean the Secretary of State of the United States?
[01:06:00.678 --> 01:06:03.600]  Yeah, Russia can barely hold itself together.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:09.523]  We can walk in and buy it all up and help the Russians and help us and checkmate China and the globalists.
[01:06:09.923 --> 01:06:11.744]  And our whole military is like, let's do this.
[01:06:11.784 --> 01:06:18.868]  This is the perfect move to empower the West, empower Christian countries, and we should buy Russia for like nothing.
[01:06:18.968 --> 01:06:19.968]  And then here's the deal.
[01:06:19.988 --> 01:06:23.090]  The Russians just say you're not going to teach five-year-olds how to get blowjobs.
[01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:24.451]  Russia actually said that.
[01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:26.371]  You can come in here and do business.
[01:06:26.671 --> 01:06:28.732]  Don't teach our kids how to be sexual at age 5.
[01:06:29.112 --> 01:06:29.992]  And we're going to be Christian.
[01:06:30.012 --> 01:06:30.572]  Leave us alone.
[01:06:31.292 --> 01:06:33.093]  And Rex Tillerson and Trump go, absolutely.
[01:06:33.393 --> 01:06:36.134]  We're ready to come in and build everything here.
[01:06:36.274 --> 01:06:37.014]  You can come here.
[01:06:37.334 --> 01:06:37.854]  We're done.
[01:06:38.134 --> 01:06:39.354]  China will have to reform.
[01:06:39.914 --> 01:06:40.795]  All this will change.
[01:06:40.835 --> 01:06:41.955]  The globalists are all over China.
[01:06:42.175 --> 01:06:43.215]  So what she's saying is true.
[01:06:43.595 --> 01:06:50.817]  We have scumbags that want to actually go in and do business with Russia when Russia has been under globalist
[01:06:52.387 --> 01:07:00.557]  Control, since 1917, and the same bankers, the very same families that have hijacked us in textbooks, have literally hijacked Russia.
[01:07:00.637 --> 01:07:07.124]  And Russia is, Russia is behind this, because Russia is the first country, they're not perfect, they're the first country to kick the new old order.
[01:07:07.745 --> 01:07:08.546]  Across the road.
[01:07:08.826 --> 01:07:16.193]  They thought they had Yeltsin drunk and controlling him and, you know, oh, yeah, we got the Patriot and the Russians wanted freedom and American blue jeans in love with us.
[01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:20.917]  And the Russians were all ready to work against it because they'd already been under it for 80 years, 85 years.
[01:07:21.217 --> 01:07:23.940]  And then Yeltsin gets in there, comes in Putin and all the rest of these.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.982]  Shadow Christians the whole time, hating it, biding their time.
[01:07:28.302 --> 01:07:35.466]  Alexander Shultz and Eaton goes back to Russia, the whole ballgame, and now the whole thing, Russia is attacking the New World Order, and they don't even know.
[01:07:35.486 --> 01:07:40.409]  So in a way, when she says, this all comes from Russia, it's true, because everybody wants out of this crap.
[01:07:40.669 --> 01:07:43.391]  Yeah, Russia decided that it didn't want to commit suicide.
[01:07:43.671 --> 01:07:44.831]  That's a grim, great idea.
[01:07:45.052 --> 01:07:48.554]  Let's say Russia invented the idea of not committing suicide, Buckley.
[01:07:49.314 --> 01:07:49.814]  There you go!
[01:07:49.994 --> 01:07:50.695]  There's the big truth!
[01:07:51.869 --> 01:07:52.169]  Absolutely.
[01:07:52.189 --> 01:07:53.170]  I mean, what do you say to that before you take it?
[01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:54.211]  I mean, that's what happened!
[01:07:54.411 --> 01:08:01.358]  Well, I think it's pretty obvious that they've been under siege by the globalists forever, and you have all that encroachment that Soros is... That's because they were their own country!
[01:08:01.598 --> 01:08:02.659]  The biggest country in the world!
[01:08:02.699 --> 01:08:06.863]  Like, they need all those little Eastern European falling-apart rat holes.
[01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:08.444]  That's Russia's problem.
[01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:09.205]  They don't need that.
[01:08:09.565 --> 01:08:10.446]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:15.168]  So they've been under siege from all the sanctions that, you know, the rest of the world's been putting on them, etc.
[01:08:15.608 --> 01:08:18.690]  And they're ready to just break free and have, you know, have some freedom.
[01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:19.891]  And so are we!
[01:08:20.291 --> 01:08:20.591]  Exactly.
[01:08:20.631 --> 01:08:28.856]  If I'm a Russian agent for wanting tax cuts for poor people and factories in minority areas and loans to small businesses, then I am.
[01:08:29.156 --> 01:08:29.896]  It's a lie.
[01:08:30.117 --> 01:08:32.118]  The globalists are agents of corruption.
[01:08:32.418 --> 01:08:33.959]  That's who the real foreign agents are.
[01:08:34.299 --> 01:08:35.760]  The Russians, give me a break.
[01:08:36.869 --> 01:08:42.791]  Trump sits around, and if somebody isn't messing with us, dominating us, running over us, he loves them.
[01:08:43.271 --> 01:09:00.717]  If he can work with them, and he doesn't think they're cowards, he looks at China, who enslaves their own people, who's running wild, who has all these slave factories, allied with all the leftist scum that sold us out, and he sees an enemy he wants to break, because he wants to free the Chinese people, because a real man can't stand screwing over little people.
[01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:02.078]  Makes them feel like crap!
[01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:05.420]  But again, real men don't want to stand up.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:14.686]  Real men want to be cowards and, like, be scared to say they like Trump and be scared to be involved and, like, you know, and let their brainwashed wife, and I'm not bashing women on average.
[01:09:14.706 --> 01:09:20.270]  There's a lot of women that are actually supporting Le Pen and supporting the nationalist movement in England and here.
[01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:23.772]  But I'm talking about the women that are brainwashed that think the state's their husband.
[01:09:23.972 --> 01:09:26.634]  Hey, sweetheart, what did the state ever give you, sweetheart?
[01:09:26.974 --> 01:09:28.615]  Didn't give you jack crap.
[01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.937]  Your daddy and your mommy gave you life.
[01:09:31.177 --> 01:09:32.078]  We're called humans.
[01:09:32.318 --> 01:09:33.018]  Get used to it.
[01:09:33.098 --> 01:09:33.339]  Go ahead.
[01:09:34.059 --> 01:09:37.001]  Alright, so Bama Bangz says, Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[01:09:37.821 --> 01:09:41.744]  He just ordered some coffee from the Infowars store and I can- Oh yeah, let me just announce this.
[01:09:42.524 --> 01:09:43.965]  They're already coming after me on every front.
[01:09:44.485 --> 01:09:51.890]  They already saw what we did with $100,000 taken over and exposing Bill Clinton as a rapist when they were trying to say Trump was a sex predator with no evidence.
[01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:54.972]  I got tricks up my sleeve, and I'm not bragging.
[01:09:55.532 --> 01:09:56.593]  You think you're Maxi Avelli?
[01:09:56.653 --> 01:09:59.755]  I got tricks a thousand times more vicious.
[01:10:00.335 --> 01:10:03.297]  The problem is, I don't want to release this stuff on the earth, and I'm not bragging.
[01:10:04.059 --> 01:10:04.680]  No, people know.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:09.325]  And I'm just going to tell the New World Order, I am innately, genetically weaponized.
[01:10:09.766 --> 01:10:13.951]  And if they think that they're going to, I've already got stuff where they kill me or do something, it's already done.
[01:10:14.231 --> 01:10:17.055]  But let me just tell you, in fact, I think I'm taking the gloves off.
[01:10:17.315 --> 01:10:20.679]  I think I'm going to go into my room, close the door in the next few days, I'm going to go off air.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:26.181]  And I'm going to meditate and think of the plans God gives me to destroy them, to give the listeners.
[01:10:26.241 --> 01:10:26.601]  That's it.
[01:10:26.801 --> 01:10:29.922]  Peaceful plans, not violent, but information warfare weapons.
[01:10:30.322 --> 01:10:39.223]  I think it's time for everybody to pray for God to give you the weapon systems and the weapon plans, peacefully, to be as wise as serpents, peaceful as doves, to defeat the enemy.
[01:10:39.243 --> 01:10:41.984]  But I am now, only got a few times, I'm going to pray.
[01:10:43.324 --> 01:10:46.025]  I'm going to pray for the answers and I'm going to get them.
[01:10:46.445 --> 01:10:46.705]  Go ahead.
[01:10:48.191 --> 01:10:52.274]  So to finish his question, he says he thoroughly enjoyed your podcast with Joe Rogan.
[01:10:52.494 --> 01:10:53.795]  Why do you think Apple took it down?
[01:10:53.955 --> 01:10:56.577]  What forces are in play in that decision-making process?
[01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:02.957]  You know, I've looked at Apple, and I've looked at most of these groups.
[01:11:02.977 --> 01:11:07.300]  They go get the highest tech people, and they bring them into meetings, and they say, the world's overpopulated.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:09.541]  We can't, couldn't let the general public have this.
[01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:11.822]  We gotta have a monopoly to stop nuclear war.
[01:11:11.842 --> 01:11:14.184]  And they get the average college student that's got a 200 IQ.
[01:11:14.964 --> 01:11:17.646]  You know, my dad, uh, was the top of his class.
[01:11:18.346 --> 01:11:20.467]  And he was, like, giving anti-community speeches on his own.
[01:11:20.487 --> 01:11:22.128]  He was on the radio when he was, like, 15.
[01:11:22.649 --> 01:11:23.929]  He had all of it going for him.
[01:11:24.249 --> 01:11:24.730]  And they were like,
[01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:31.252]  Chip him lasers when he was 15, just like trucks would show up with ruby lasers and designs to see what he'd do.
[01:11:31.512 --> 01:11:32.212]  But it wasn't just him.
[01:11:32.252 --> 01:11:35.154]  That was like the whiz kid thing that Eisenhower would have had to come after him.
[01:11:35.174 --> 01:11:36.674]  You know, Kennedy had already been in office.
[01:11:37.094 --> 01:11:37.814]  And they did that.
[01:11:38.435 --> 01:11:40.095]  But then they make the kids feel they're all in power.
[01:11:40.115 --> 01:11:42.056]  They go, here's the secret nuclear reactor under UT.
[01:11:42.076 --> 01:11:43.857]  You know, they don't even say it's there today.
[01:11:43.877 --> 01:11:44.417]  My dad was there.
[01:11:45.097 --> 01:11:48.318]  And here we're going to mutate stuff and we're going to do all this and you're the best.
[01:11:48.358 --> 01:11:50.759]  And by the way, we're going to have to do some bad stuff for the greater good.
[01:11:51.379 --> 01:11:57.101]  And then my dad in college saw the stuff they were actually doing, running the counterculture and running the communist movement.
[01:11:57.141 --> 01:11:58.662]  And my dad said, I'm not part of this.
[01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:03.363]  OK, but the point is, is that my dad was smart enough to say no.
[01:12:04.303 --> 01:12:07.104]  When it comes to mathematics and stuff, he's really good at all that.
[01:12:07.925 --> 01:12:08.925]  And engineering, I'm not.
[01:12:09.345 --> 01:12:09.865]  I didn't get all that.
[01:12:09.905 --> 01:12:11.386]  I got the like public speaking.
[01:12:13.089 --> 01:12:18.854]  That they got the brain trust of this country to work against America and that's why they're in this position.
[01:12:18.874 --> 01:12:19.414]  What was the question?
[01:12:19.454 --> 01:12:21.116]  I forget it.
[01:12:21.716 --> 01:12:24.459]  The question was about Apple and how did that happen?
[01:12:24.499 --> 01:12:25.579]  I mean they just get people...
[01:12:26.536 --> 01:12:27.897]  Like Steve Jobs and all of them.
[01:12:28.137 --> 01:12:30.359]  And Steve Jobs wouldn't even let his own kids have iPads.
[01:12:30.519 --> 01:12:31.080]  That's on record.
[01:12:32.201 --> 01:12:36.565]  And the evidence I have is they gave him a weaponized virus that ate his liver.
[01:12:37.025 --> 01:12:37.866]  And that didn't work.
[01:12:37.966 --> 01:12:40.368]  It continued on to eat all his organs no matter what he had.
[01:12:40.388 --> 01:12:44.892]  So they killed him because they all said he was this big secular, evil, heartless guy.
[01:12:44.952 --> 01:12:46.893]  No, Steve Jobs really was worried about all this.
[01:12:47.314 --> 01:12:48.214]  And they killed Steve Jobs.
[01:12:48.254 --> 01:12:49.736]  That's well known in intelligence circles.
[01:12:50.096 --> 01:12:51.057]  They murdered Steve Jobs.
[01:12:52.734 --> 01:13:04.044]  And they just get people, like Zuckerberg's the total front guy from Harvard, the CIA already had it, the CIA project, the CIA came out of Harvard, he just was the front guy, the little PR guy, he wears little black t-shirts and all this crap.
[01:13:04.644 --> 01:13:11.590]  They just, they hire people that want to totally dominate everybody, think they're better than everybody, and so that's how they're able to get this done.
[01:13:12.851 --> 01:13:13.912]  Was that their question?
[01:13:14.012 --> 01:13:19.496]  Basically, they were asking why, what was the mechanism behind having your podcast, the Joe Rogan podcast?
[01:13:19.536 --> 01:13:21.358]  Oh, I mean, I mean, look, look, look, look.
[01:13:23.675 --> 01:13:27.856]  They say, you're really powerful, you've got to show your will, come in here and rape this kid.
[01:13:28.416 --> 01:13:29.276]  Or murder him.
[01:13:30.297 --> 01:13:34.338]  And just like gangs say, you've got to go rob a liquor store, you've got to go kill an old lady.
[01:13:34.838 --> 01:13:38.219]  They'll pull up, this is what gangs do, all major gangs in history.
[01:13:38.839 --> 01:13:42.380]  They'll pull up and say, you see that old lady out there getting her mail?
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.681]  Grab her, take her, pull her teeth out with pliers and then shoot her in the head.
[01:13:48.721 --> 01:13:52.602]  And then rape her dead body and we're going to make you a member of the Eastside Vatos or whatever.
[01:13:53.632 --> 01:13:54.192]  That's all it is.
[01:13:54.713 --> 01:13:58.054]  So, most people don't want to rape the kids, they've just got to do it.
[01:13:58.775 --> 01:14:06.298]  And then they spiritually, you're fallen, and then I guess in their view, they're able to program you there, and then God's protection's gone, so you can be a good slave for them.
[01:14:07.079 --> 01:14:10.360]  And so, that's why, I mean, Joe Rogan wanted to bring that up.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.601]  He knew all about it.
[01:14:12.361 --> 01:14:15.603]  We didn't even blame anybody, we just showed mainstream news articles, they couldn't stand that.
[01:14:16.363 --> 01:14:19.626]  And so, they blocked it, and still it was the top podcast of all time.
[01:14:20.046 --> 01:14:21.447]  Which again, shows this hunger.
[01:14:21.807 --> 01:14:24.009]  But the point is, this censorship's happening now.
[01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:33.396]  You have to spread the links, you have to point out it's being blocked, and you have to buy products, not just from me, but other people that are doing their own thing.
[01:14:33.436 --> 01:14:39.441]  I mean, Joe Rogan, I know, he didn't tell me this, I learned from other sources, and I talked to him about it, he said, yeah, I'm not gonna talk about it.
[01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:41.423]  He got threatened about five years ago.
[01:14:42.583 --> 01:14:48.230]  And he got threatened really serious in him and his family if he didn't stop getting into conspiracies because they knew how popular he was.
[01:14:49.231 --> 01:14:52.275]  They had him do some TV show that made fun of it all, the rest of it.
[01:14:52.836 --> 01:14:54.357]  He was a sellout, but it was a process.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:56.680]  When that show was starting.
[01:14:56.721 --> 01:14:58.301]  He wasn't even aware of what was happening to him at the time.
[01:14:58.741 --> 01:14:59.722]  But I talked to folks that were there.
[01:14:59.742 --> 01:15:00.962]  And I'll just say this.
[01:15:01.383 --> 01:15:02.263]  Joe disagrees.
[01:15:02.283 --> 01:15:02.623]  He can say it.
[01:15:02.643 --> 01:15:03.684]  But he knows this is true.
[01:15:04.444 --> 01:15:06.985]  And so that's why I was on the show and he was like finishing my sentences.
[01:15:07.386 --> 01:15:09.246]  Joe knows as much of this as I do.
[01:15:09.346 --> 01:15:10.407]  Joe, I'm not kissing his ass.
[01:15:10.787 --> 01:15:11.487]  He really knows.
[01:15:11.527 --> 01:15:12.088]  He's a smart guy.
[01:15:12.748 --> 01:15:13.449]  He's a tough guy.
[01:15:13.469 --> 01:15:14.129]  He's a father.
[01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.331]  He grew up in Boston.
[01:15:16.371 --> 01:15:20.275]  He was a national taekwondo champion, full contact.
[01:15:20.455 --> 01:15:22.737]  He would have been a champion when he was younger.
[01:15:22.997 --> 01:15:24.138]  He's a smart guy.
[01:15:24.158 --> 01:15:24.659]  He's a real man.
[01:15:25.299 --> 01:15:26.360]  And then he learned about all this.
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:31.044]  He talked about it and they dropped by and they said, you know, you want what you're doing, your family, shut your mouth.
[01:15:34.127 --> 01:15:56.445]  He's kind of mentioned to me some of the threats and stuff, but the point is, is that that's how Joe could sit there, and like, you watch that thing, I mean, I'm exhausted, I'm tired, I'm sick of being on air, and I'm drinking some whiskey and everything, and I was already like, I don't really smoke pot because I don't like it, it makes me paranoid, but it was already stoned in the room, they're like, it's kind of a rite of passage to do it, and I smoked pot, I'd tell people, you know me back when I was a teenager, I was a big pot guy?
[01:15:56.605 --> 01:15:56.966]  Never.
[01:15:57.526 --> 01:15:59.328]  I swear, I don't think I've ever seen you smoke anything.
[01:15:59.368 --> 01:15:59.928]  What do I like?
[01:16:00.509 --> 01:16:01.550]  Let's just admit it, what do I like?
[01:16:04.554 --> 01:16:05.915]  Other than that, uh, alcohol.
[01:16:05.935 --> 01:16:06.595]  Yeah, alcohol.
[01:16:07.056 --> 01:16:08.317]  But the thing is, I'm being honest.
[01:16:08.357 --> 01:16:10.218]  It's like, oh my god, you're this pothead.
[01:16:10.278 --> 01:16:10.498]  No.
[01:16:11.159 --> 01:16:12.920]  But Joe always has the best medical stuff.
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.841]  They have like Sativa and, what was the other one?
[01:16:15.121 --> 01:16:15.542]  Indica?
[01:16:15.662 --> 01:16:18.363]  And at least he has like, joints that are like $500.
[01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:21.426]  So he only smokes the stuff that actually makes someone.
[01:16:21.506 --> 01:16:22.446]  Joe, I'll smoke it.
[01:16:22.466 --> 01:16:24.728]  That's like a 1942 Chateau.
[01:16:25.208 --> 01:16:29.591]  Jack, it's like 10 years ago, I smoked something with him at dinner at like a steakhouse.
[01:16:29.611 --> 01:16:30.752]  And I was like, whoa!
[01:16:30.892 --> 01:16:32.033]  I ate the steak, drank wine.
[01:16:32.053 --> 01:16:33.514]  I was like, this is incredible.
[01:16:33.934 --> 01:16:37.115]  So I don't like drugs because, you know, I'm already upset about what's happening.
[01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:38.836]  I want something to lower my consciousness.
[01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:49.840]  Stuff that heightens it makes me really get freaked out, but the pot Joe gets, because he's like me, he admits he gets paranoid, is like so... What's the term?
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:55.242]  Just like micro, it's so crafted, it's so... So well genetically designed?
[01:16:55.919 --> 01:16:56.359]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:56.379 --> 01:16:59.682]  It's so dialed in that then I would smoke that if it was legal in Texas.
[01:16:59.702 --> 01:17:00.682]  But I got kids, family.
[01:17:00.702 --> 01:17:02.343]  I don't, I mean, I don't, I don't even speed anymore.
[01:17:02.363 --> 01:17:04.665]  You know, like down the road because of the position I'm in.
[01:17:04.985 --> 01:17:06.026]  Plus, you know, the safety issues.
[01:17:06.046 --> 01:17:07.747]  But enough about me to ask the question.
[01:17:08.327 --> 01:17:14.772]  It's just that I went on there and so I won't smoke pot in private, but because I'm for decriminalization, I know a group of people in prison for it.
[01:17:15.132 --> 01:17:15.772]  I disagree with you.
[01:17:15.872 --> 01:17:17.573]  Attorney General Pick on that.
[01:17:17.613 --> 01:17:18.834]  He's a great guy, but he's wrong on that.
[01:17:18.894 --> 01:17:19.255]  Sessions.
[01:17:19.695 --> 01:17:25.639]  I was like, yeah, I'll smoke it here so that when I get accused of things, I can explain, hey, he's got amazing weed.
[01:17:26.199 --> 01:17:32.084]  It has a lot of medical uses and when I see Joe, usually once a year he comes to have comedy, it's kind of a tradition we smoke pot.
[01:17:32.885 --> 01:17:40.212]  So, you know, there's like this Belly of the Beast documentary online and music video where he's trying to get me to smoke pot and I won't smoke it and I say that shit makes me paranoid.
[01:17:40.832 --> 01:17:42.213]  Bleep that, we're gonna air this tomorrow.
[01:17:43.094 --> 01:17:44.055]  But, you know, that's it.
[01:17:44.115 --> 01:17:45.896]  It's like I can't be this fake, you know?
[01:17:46.437 --> 01:17:49.059]  I can't sit there and like say, yeah, I've...
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.682]  You know, I've used other illegal drugs.
[01:17:51.842 --> 01:17:52.283]  I hated them.
[01:17:53.144 --> 01:17:54.025]  I absolutely hated them.
[01:17:54.306 --> 01:17:58.111]  I haven't had tobacco, other than like one cigar, in like six years.
[01:17:58.151 --> 01:17:58.972]  I finally kicked that.
[01:17:59.733 --> 01:18:02.577]  Alcohol's my big, big 800-pound gorilla, man.
[01:18:02.597 --> 01:18:06.902]  That's... People say all the time, you must be on cocaine, you're so excited.
[01:18:07.763 --> 01:18:22.626]  No, I know, and I talk to former heads of like, you know, defense agencies and CIA chiefs and generals and former heads of Homeland Security committees, and they're telling me I'm dead on, it's worse than I know.
[01:18:23.086 --> 01:18:26.527]  If that doesn't excite you and make you want to warn people, what does?
[01:18:26.607 --> 01:18:32.829]  I mean, if a big-ass pit bull, pit bulls are nice, but you know, a bad one is chasing me, wanting to bite me, I'm gonna be excited, you know what I mean?
[01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:34.729]  Even if I got home from work and I'm tired,
[01:18:35.129 --> 01:18:37.511]  One time this happened, this big-ass pit bull runs out trying to bite me.
[01:18:37.731 --> 01:18:39.353]  I was like jumping on top of a car real quick.
[01:18:39.373 --> 01:18:41.475]  It's like psychic flight or fight syndrome.
[01:18:41.535 --> 01:18:41.995]  Exactly!
[01:18:42.536 --> 01:18:44.918]  People say, oh, he must be on cocaine or something.
[01:18:45.398 --> 01:18:45.558]  Huh.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.161]  I've done cocaine a couple times in high school.
[01:18:49.442 --> 01:18:51.524]  And people said, oh, this is real cocaine in college.
[01:18:51.604 --> 01:18:52.084]  Try this.
[01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:52.905]  It was just as bad.
[01:18:53.745 --> 01:18:56.488]  And it felt like when I'd been in a car wreck or seen a car wreck or had my ass really kicked bad.
[01:18:56.508 --> 01:18:57.048]  Yeah, I was like wide awake.
[01:18:57.068 --> 01:19:01.152]  Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[01:19:01.351 --> 01:19:02.835]  Really scared, really freaked out.
[01:19:02.915 --> 01:19:05.321]  I guess people that aren't already awake, they want to feel like that.
[01:19:05.762 --> 01:19:06.704]  For me, it's not good.
[01:19:07.714 --> 01:19:09.195]  You know, you were in college, you were at parties.
[01:19:09.235 --> 01:19:09.776]  I would never do it.
[01:19:09.796 --> 01:19:11.337]  They're like, whoa, keep that away from me.
[01:19:11.697 --> 01:19:13.439]  Because I'm naturally high, folks.
[01:19:14.419 --> 01:19:21.545]  I drink alcohol sometimes, and I've quit sometimes for months and one time a year, because I can't handle the truth.
[01:19:21.865 --> 01:19:29.151]  I'll admit, I punch out and dump a bottle of red wine on my brain, because when asked about me, it's not about me, but it's the experience fighting this.
[01:19:29.511 --> 01:19:32.473]  It's about being totally truthful with these questions, ask me anything.
[01:19:34.875 --> 01:19:35.835]  God, I am answering everything.
[01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:36.236]  I don't know.
[01:19:36.256 --> 01:19:40.978]  Joe didn't get pissed at me, because I was told by a bunch of his friends and people, because he was really getting hardcore.
[01:19:41.398 --> 01:19:43.239]  He was studying this stuff like 10 hours a day.
[01:19:43.259 --> 01:19:46.460]  He's a UFC guy, big TV host, movie star.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.461]  I mean, Joe's like a major icon.
[01:19:48.481 --> 01:19:50.922]  If he really wanted to be a leader, Chuck Norris they threatened.
[01:19:51.362 --> 01:19:55.184]  I'm not going to get into that whole story, but Chuck Norris listens to us almost every day.
[01:19:55.204 --> 01:19:56.865]  You know, his son's a fan, been on the show.
[01:19:57.305 --> 01:19:58.746]  It's not bragging about Chuck Norris.
[01:19:58.806 --> 01:20:01.647]  It's that, you know, Chuck Norris is 70-something years old.
[01:20:01.667 --> 01:20:03.408]  He's got more kids than his other wife, great lady.
[01:20:04.248 --> 01:20:08.811]  And they came and they basically, you know, I mean, it's, you know, I just, I can't tell people.
[01:20:08.831 --> 01:20:11.893]  It's just that, you know, and I get it.
[01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:16.376]  But at a certain point, the guy that comes and threatens me next ain't leaving.
[01:20:16.516 --> 01:20:16.957]  You know what I mean?
[01:20:16.977 --> 01:20:19.478]  And it's not that I'm Mr. Big Badass.
[01:20:19.498 --> 01:20:20.219]  That's what I don't get.
[01:20:20.259 --> 01:20:21.920]  It's like we got it.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.521]  And I'm not saying Chuck Norris has rolled over.
[01:20:23.561 --> 01:20:24.141]  He's done a lot.
[01:20:24.201 --> 01:20:33.708]  But imagine all the other people of Joe Rogan and Chuck Norris and all these people that have been threatened, you know,
[01:20:36.158 --> 01:20:37.878]  Because, you know, Chuck Norris knows I've been threatened.
[01:20:38.979 --> 01:20:41.039]  And he knows the type of threats that have gone on.
[01:20:41.159 --> 01:20:43.260]  And some of the stuff they've done to him is, you know, pretty bad.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:48.341]  And it's all because they respect him and know he has cachet with the public and they know the military is ready to follow him.
[01:20:49.202 --> 01:20:57.584]  And so, you know, Chuck, you've done a lot, but, you know, here's Chuck Norris' problem.
[01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.265]  Chuck Norris has, and same thing with Joe Rogan.
[01:21:01.865 --> 01:21:04.126]  They're like two, they're both like Taekwondo champions.
[01:21:05.788 --> 01:21:16.130]  They both are so humble at a fundamental level, even though they know they're alpha males, that they get threatened, and they kind of want to fight that, but they don't know how, because it's like nebulous.
[01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:18.111]  And then, well, will the public listen to me?
[01:21:18.151 --> 01:21:19.731]  And I kind of want to be this grandstander.
[01:21:19.991 --> 01:21:21.292]  It doesn't matter, bro.
[01:21:21.692 --> 01:21:22.312]  I'm the same way.
[01:21:24.933 --> 01:21:28.113]  I mean, I'm not looking for trouble, but somebody's got to stand up.
[01:21:29.474 --> 01:21:32.074]  Somebody's got to say like they got that homeland thing, making fun of me.
[01:21:32.134 --> 01:21:32.874]  You want to fight?
[01:21:32.894 --> 01:21:33.495]  That's what they hate.
[01:21:33.515 --> 01:21:35.015]  I don't know how this is going to end.
[01:21:36.305 --> 01:21:38.246]  Well, we should probably queue up, they're making fun of me on Homeland.
[01:21:38.967 --> 01:21:50.974]  But I mean, if you want, if you really want to fight, I mean, you really want to keep doing this, you really think you've beaten humanity, you really want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:21:51.755 --> 01:22:05.824]  That's all I'm saying is, I don't know how this is going to end, but if you want a fight, if you want to shove wheels up against each other, just so you can go screw kids and kill women and be an asshole, then I'm ready to destroy you.
[01:22:07.901 --> 01:22:08.381]  Understand that?
[01:22:08.562 --> 01:22:09.863]  I want to destroy you.
[01:22:10.143 --> 01:22:11.144]  Yes, it's true, Globalist.
[01:22:11.244 --> 01:22:12.044]  I want to kill you.
[01:22:13.005 --> 01:22:15.948]  But not because I want to piss on your grave and be bigger than you.
[01:22:16.368 --> 01:22:22.673]  I want you to get off the kids and get off the women and stop all your crap and your gang raping and all your wimpy stuff.
[01:22:22.733 --> 01:22:26.896]  I want you to feel an alpha male drive his fist in your face till my arm breaks off.
[01:22:27.277 --> 01:22:28.558]  Just because you need that.
[01:22:28.658 --> 01:22:30.079]  You need to fall low.
[01:22:30.359 --> 01:22:31.800]  You need to feel what that's like.
[01:22:35.043 --> 01:22:37.445]  People like Chuck Norris think humanity's too fallen to listen.
[01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:40.350]  And all the rest, all the other big names.
[01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:43.673]  I mean, I've talked to most of them and it's not like some pissing contest.
[01:22:43.693 --> 01:22:44.994]  Oh, I talked to famous people.
[01:22:45.334 --> 01:22:45.954]  I talked to them.
[01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:47.075]  You think it makes me feel good?
[01:22:47.716 --> 01:22:50.938]  They'd liked all these big names, all these big men and guys have been around.
[01:22:50.978 --> 01:22:51.719]  I feel their spirit.
[01:22:51.779 --> 01:22:53.980]  They're strong right next to me, stronger than me.
[01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:58.844]  And they just don't have the initiative to get in the arena with these people because they don't quite know how to do it.
[01:22:58.884 --> 01:23:03.648]  Like there was, there was like a set arena and referees and like, they felt like it was the law.
[01:23:03.868 --> 01:23:05.049]  See, they're so godly.
[01:23:05.289 --> 01:23:06.450]  They don't want to go wild.
[01:23:06.710 --> 01:23:07.631]  See, I'm evil.
[01:23:08.291 --> 01:23:09.052]  Not in a bad way.
[01:23:09.613 --> 01:23:10.754]  I know God and I love God.
[01:23:10.994 --> 01:23:16.741]  But I am twisted enough and enough of an outlaw and a rebel that I won't sit here and wait for directives.
[01:23:17.121 --> 01:23:18.443]  I won't sit here and bow down to this.
[01:23:18.483 --> 01:23:19.564]  And I don't care what you do.
[01:23:19.984 --> 01:23:21.566]  I'm not a child molester.
[01:23:21.927 --> 01:23:23.008]  And I'm not a rapist.
[01:23:23.288 --> 01:23:25.369]  And I'm not somebody that feeds on little people.
[01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:27.350]  In fact, I want to kill you.
[01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:30.672]  And you understand that I want to destroy you.
[01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:32.412]  You want to rape little kids?
[01:23:32.813 --> 01:23:37.255]  I want to break your jaw off and grab it with my hands and rip the mandible off your head.
[01:23:37.635 --> 01:23:39.096]  I want to bash your brains out.
[01:23:39.476 --> 01:23:40.616]  I want to bring you low.
[01:23:41.117 --> 01:23:42.858]  I'm your worst nightmare and you know it.
[01:23:43.238 --> 01:23:46.539]  And I'm looking for people that have that same spirit to crush the enemy.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.742]  I'm ready for whatever you do to me because I don't rape children!
[01:23:52.322 --> 01:23:53.863]  I don't hurt innocent people!
[01:23:54.183 --> 01:23:55.403]  I don't bomb civilians!
[01:23:55.823 --> 01:23:57.204]  I don't serve Satan!
[01:23:57.224 --> 01:23:58.804]  Go to the next question.
[01:23:59.584 --> 01:24:01.785]  Next question is by Bucks2001.
[01:24:01.825 --> 01:24:05.906]  Says, Mr. Jones, in 2015 you scored bombshell interviews with Donald Trump and Matt Drudge.
[01:24:06.326 --> 01:24:08.247]  Can you reveal how you landed those interviews?
[01:24:08.307 --> 01:24:11.168]  And also, do you plan to interview either Trump or Drudge in 2017?
[01:24:11.248 --> 01:24:16.069]  What was the first person?
[01:24:16.109 --> 01:24:18.170]  How did you score the interviews with Drudge and Trump?
[01:24:19.943 --> 01:24:20.723]  They both came to me.
[01:24:21.064 --> 01:24:22.144]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:24:22.164 --> 01:24:23.825]  Well, it's not about who I am.
[01:24:24.525 --> 01:24:25.065]  It's not that.
[01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:27.367]  Anybody that's tuned in knows this is a zeitgeist.
[01:24:27.927 --> 01:24:29.268]  And don't say that on some power trip.
[01:24:29.328 --> 01:24:32.269]  It's actually, we have squandered this, Buckley.
[01:24:32.929 --> 01:24:34.530]  We have not done what we're supposed to.
[01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:35.771]  I feel like I'm a failure.
[01:24:36.631 --> 01:24:41.353]  They came to us, and it's just like, they have this article, as I said in one speech, I'm sorry, I missed Trump's call.
[01:24:41.393 --> 01:24:44.194]  I know the numbers, I know when he calls, he calls like three times in a row.
[01:24:44.575 --> 01:24:49.857]  I was on air, he gets confused, he called me, and I missed the calls, and I just feel guilty, because who knows what it was about.
[01:24:49.877 --> 01:24:56.080]  And I know Trump doesn't, it's, I'll tell the enemy this, because they know what Trump knows is true, they need to know this.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.901]  Trump just wants to connect with a spirit that is good.
[01:25:00.731 --> 01:25:01.892]  He needs that energy.
[01:25:02.292 --> 01:25:03.553]  He's the opposite of a vampire.
[01:25:03.593 --> 01:25:04.874]  He needs to go to that rally.
[01:25:05.354 --> 01:25:06.354]  This isn't talk, folks.
[01:25:06.374 --> 01:25:06.975]  This is what it is.
[01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:09.096]  He needs to talk to people.
[01:25:09.156 --> 01:25:09.857]  He needs me.
[01:25:10.617 --> 01:25:11.417]  He needs his wife.
[01:25:11.918 --> 01:25:12.558]  He needs that.
[01:25:14.019 --> 01:25:16.881]  And that's why the enemy's coming against that.
[01:25:16.901 --> 01:25:17.721]  They make jokes about it.
[01:25:18.101 --> 01:25:18.742]  It doesn't matter.
[01:25:19.202 --> 01:25:20.883]  And he's surrounded by all these people.
[01:25:20.943 --> 01:25:21.604]  He brings them in.
[01:25:21.624 --> 01:25:23.425]  He goes, I have all the economists.
[01:25:24.289 --> 01:25:25.750]  We've totally screwed America over.
[01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:26.731]  How did we do this?
[01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:28.953]  Let's just give America a little money.
[01:25:28.973 --> 01:25:31.595]  And they say, no, America's not allowed to have anything.
[01:25:33.097 --> 01:25:34.258]  And then Trump comes out and says,
[01:25:35.635 --> 01:25:37.736]  All we're doing is turning the coal power plants on.
[01:25:38.156 --> 01:25:38.856]  Europe doesn't do it.
[01:25:38.896 --> 01:25:39.416]  We don't do it.
[01:25:39.436 --> 01:25:39.957]  They're clean.
[01:25:40.437 --> 01:25:41.917]  This is why our power prices are high.
[01:25:41.937 --> 01:25:42.958]  It's why he's calling people.
[01:25:42.978 --> 01:25:47.680]  They go, sir, the power's three times cheaper in India and Mexico and China.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.540]  We can't go there.
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:49.840]  He goes, I'll fix that.
[01:25:49.961 --> 01:25:50.641]  He goes, I promise.
[01:25:50.661 --> 01:25:51.761]  He's on the phone with the CEOs.
[01:25:52.361 --> 01:25:53.182]  And he tells them, I'll fix it.
[01:25:53.202 --> 01:25:53.522]  I'll fix it.
[01:25:53.542 --> 01:25:53.842]  He's out there.
[01:25:54.062 --> 01:25:58.544]  He's like, he just, he doesn't even, he knows bad people, but he's so innocent.
[01:25:59.364 --> 01:26:00.705]  It's like, Trump's really innocent.
[01:26:00.725 --> 01:26:01.865]  I don't see that condescendingly.
[01:26:02.365 --> 01:26:03.866]  He just can't believe, he's like,
[01:26:05.117 --> 01:26:06.720]  Goldman Sachs, I'll get you even more money.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.622]  Just get off their back.
[01:26:11.596 --> 01:26:38.956]  It's sophisticated, and that's why they hate the fact that Trump, every night for hours, goes around, he listens to like Rush Limbaugh and me, and he goes to Drudge, and he goes to Breitbart, obviously, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then
[01:26:39.076 --> 01:26:44.068]  And then you've got all these sellouts and all these scumbags and all this filth that just think that we're there.
[01:26:44.289 --> 01:26:46.675]  And imagine a scumbag looking at a family.
[01:26:47.771 --> 01:26:55.277]  All the little creeper man, metaphysically, and they want, they hate the dad, they hate the mom, they hate the happy kids hopping up and down because they don't have that.
[01:26:55.658 --> 01:27:01.583]  And they want to get you out of the way and metaphysically take their time with your kids, which the public schools do.
[01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:06.207]  And if a public school teacher comes out and admits she supported Trump, they fire her by today.
[01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:10.590]  And if we would support Trump, they kick us off and we lose $5 million yesterday.
[01:27:11.591 --> 01:27:20.615]  And they just sit there and laugh at us like they're ruling over us and bankrupting Russia and Europe and making the middle class poor.
[01:27:20.635 --> 01:27:23.757]  But let me tell you, the Japanese aren't perfect.
[01:27:24.037 --> 01:27:24.717]  They're tired of this.
[01:27:24.737 --> 01:27:25.557]  They want prosperity.
[01:27:25.757 --> 01:27:26.558]  They've been doing what the U.S.
[01:27:26.578 --> 01:27:26.718]  says.
[01:27:26.738 --> 01:27:27.578]  They're ready for prosperity.
[01:27:27.858 --> 01:27:28.779]  The Chinese want it too.
[01:27:29.279 --> 01:27:31.000]  I'm not against anybody, what color they are.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.842]  They have to resonate with the truth and understand this isn't talk, people.
[01:27:36.222 --> 01:27:40.084]  You think I told you before the election they're going to round up pedophiles nationwide?
[01:27:40.104 --> 01:27:42.465]  They're going to start in California and Pennsylvania and it happened?
[01:27:42.906 --> 01:27:44.126]  And now they arrested thousands?
[01:27:44.807 --> 01:27:46.247]  You think I'm playing freaking games?
[01:27:46.627 --> 01:27:48.408]  You think I talked to the Easter Bunny, baby?
[01:27:48.869 --> 01:27:49.929]  This is real, okay?
[01:27:50.289 --> 01:27:51.290]  This isn't a game.
[01:27:51.610 --> 01:27:53.331]  There's a reason we're doing this.
[01:27:53.911 --> 01:28:01.280]  Because there aren't many people that can handle the level of satanic attack that happens when you do this stuff.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.161]  Okay?
[01:28:02.561 --> 01:28:04.083]  It just rolls right off me.
[01:28:04.543 --> 01:28:07.126]  Everybody else around me gets burned alive by it.
[01:28:07.467 --> 01:28:08.288]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:28:08.588 --> 01:28:11.031]  The point is, I am made to go after these people.
[01:28:11.531 --> 01:28:14.532]  I know who they are, I know who they serve, and we're going to get them.
[01:28:14.892 --> 01:28:22.395]  But if you will simply activate and take action, there are men and women who have black skin, and brown skin, and red skin, and white skin.
[01:28:22.575 --> 01:28:24.056]  Don't give me some political, oh, red skin!
[01:28:24.276 --> 01:28:25.876]  Oh my God, I love when I got red skin!
[01:28:26.137 --> 01:28:28.037]  I'm a red skin, more red skin than you are!
[01:28:28.057 --> 01:28:30.078]  Ain't many Comanches walking around nowadays.
[01:28:30.418 --> 01:28:37.761]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, is that I want to defeat these people, and you have to believe you're real, you have to believe I'm real,
[01:28:38.001 --> 01:28:41.935]  And you have to take that action and ask God for the directives to defeat these people.
[01:28:42.256 --> 01:28:43.280]  There are men and women.
[01:28:44.173 --> 01:28:59.944]  Across this world, in Africa, and in Eurasia, and in North America, and in South America, and in Central America, and in the islands of the Pacific, and in Australia, they have the force and the will and the commitment for human destiny.
[01:29:00.384 --> 01:29:05.087]  But you have to stand for what's true and be ridiculed and be laughed at.
[01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:08.129]  And once you've done it a few times, it's a joke and you're free.
[01:29:08.769 --> 01:29:10.190]  It's like a bird out of a cage.
[01:29:10.651 --> 01:29:13.573]  Once you enter that fulcrum, once you escape
[01:29:14.454 --> 01:29:17.480]  Thinking what other people care, you know, say about you, you're free.
[01:29:18.182 --> 01:29:19.765]  And so, that's all I'm saying.
[01:29:21.018 --> 01:29:21.898]  That's all I'm telling you.
[01:29:22.458 --> 01:29:24.639]  And you have to realize that and do it.
[01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:26.019]  And I know many of you already get that.
[01:29:26.299 --> 01:29:27.019]  Then be leaders.
[01:29:27.759 --> 01:29:28.940]  Don't get involved in the infighting.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.380]  Don't get involved in all the side BS.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.860]  Take action for your love of humanity.
[01:29:33.541 --> 01:29:44.643]  And I'll tell you, the only thing you're going to have a problem with is you're going to be so high, so awake, so connected, so dialed in, so discerning that you're going to not know what to do.
[01:29:46.334 --> 01:29:47.554]  Again, that's consciousness.
[01:29:48.215 --> 01:30:12.942]  We're like Ulysses after 20 years at sea returning home to the enemies that have captured his family stronghold and we're here to restore order and point this species towards the star and give our little egglings, our little hatchlings, a chance to be what they were supposed to be and not have a bunch of vampires feed on our substance and convince us we're nobody and convince us we're their slaves.
[01:30:13.582 --> 01:30:14.062]  Next question.
[01:30:15.163 --> 01:30:21.607]  Landino Soup says, hi Alex, back in the year 2000, Microsoft was investigated by the Justice Department for monopolistic practices.
[01:30:21.627 --> 01:30:22.927]  Monopolistic.
[01:30:23.228 --> 01:30:24.448]  Monopolistic practices.
[01:30:24.929 --> 01:30:27.190]  All because they published a single internet browser.
[01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:32.333]  The result was Microsoft being heavily restricted by government bureaucrats regulating what Microsoft did for years.
[01:30:32.913 --> 01:30:38.438]  While extreme today, we currently have huge oligarchies in the corporate world that are complete monstrosities compared to what Microsoft did.
[01:30:38.778 --> 01:30:41.680]  These include Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, Apple, Reddit, etc.
[01:30:42.141 --> 01:30:49.547]  Trump has actually fought monopolistic practices, took on and sued the NFL, and made them admit that they were a monopoly, but nothing really came of it after that.
[01:30:49.947 --> 01:30:52.129]  He definitely has a vendetta against these practices.
[01:30:52.589 --> 01:30:59.891]  Do you think the Trump administration will take action against these massive companies impugning on our free speech and right to free choice and competition?
[01:31:00.351 --> 01:31:03.492]  If he does, how will his administration take them on?
[01:31:04.132 --> 01:31:07.773]  Well, we could spend 10 hours on that question because it's so deep.
[01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:14.314]  Bill Gates did all that antitrust stuff on purpose.
[01:31:15.094 --> 01:31:18.015]  IBM was the shadow government of the United States and Germany.
[01:31:18.885 --> 01:31:22.107]  When they let the Germans in to convince them through British intelligence.
[01:31:22.147 --> 01:31:24.469]  This is all actually in best-selling books.
[01:31:24.509 --> 01:31:25.670]  I mean, this is declassified.
[01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:27.291]  And again, I say all this.
[01:31:27.311 --> 01:31:28.132]  This is not my opinion.
[01:31:28.152 --> 01:31:29.293]  This is not conspiracy theory.
[01:31:32.799 --> 01:31:42.786]  They had envisioned computer systems in the 1850s, and by the 1815 or so, or 1915, it's a complex answer.
[01:31:43.926 --> 01:31:50.431]  They had developed computer systems that were meant to track populations and human calories and controlling populations.
[01:31:52.952 --> 01:31:59.277]  They sent Thomas Watson, who ended up living for more than a decade in Germany, including part of World War II.
[01:31:59.677 --> 01:32:07.823]  This is all, you can Google Thomas Watson and Hitler, the owner of IBM, to establish a system to try to control humans through computers.
[01:32:09.344 --> 01:32:12.367]  And so you ask about Microsoft, they had major
[01:32:13.519 --> 01:32:23.302]  Laws then and antitrust laws in place since 1906 and the Sherman Antitrust Act and so they were sophisticated and they basically gave the brain trust.
[01:32:23.882 --> 01:32:26.163]  They made IBM about the computers.
[01:32:26.703 --> 01:32:27.863]  They knew the computer wasn't anything.
[01:32:27.883 --> 01:32:28.443]  It was a box.
[01:32:28.924 --> 01:32:35.906]  The operating system was given to Microsoft that was actually a DARPA front group and
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.701]  This is all actually in the news.
[01:32:38.721 --> 01:32:39.961]  This is all there.
[01:32:39.981 --> 01:32:40.562]  It's what's crazy.
[01:32:41.002 --> 01:32:46.425]  And so Bill Gates' father was the head of the Army's covert testing and eugenics program.
[01:32:47.205 --> 01:32:48.966]  And he was a clandestine officer.
[01:32:48.986 --> 01:32:51.507]  His rank, everything was secret.
[01:32:51.527 --> 01:32:52.208]  He was sheep-dipped.
[01:32:53.088 --> 01:32:58.091]  And then if you expand onto that, he was actually the head of Planned Parenthood.
[01:32:58.571 --> 01:32:59.331]  He was the chairman.
[01:32:59.632 --> 01:33:00.712]  He wasn't the public yet.
[01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:02.733]  And so they were eugenicists.
[01:33:02.753 --> 01:33:03.734]  And you can say, oh, that's good.
[01:33:03.754 --> 01:33:05.235]  Get rid of the minorities or whatever.
[01:33:05.255 --> 01:33:05.795]  But the point is,
[01:33:07.025 --> 01:33:09.407]  Yeah, because you're liberal, you kill all the brown people.
[01:33:09.487 --> 01:33:12.350]  But if you're a white guy like me, they don't want to do it, you're racist.
[01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:13.871]  But that's why it's all insane.
[01:33:15.093 --> 01:33:20.738]  They went and funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute with money from the OSS and also Army Intelligence.
[01:33:21.338 --> 01:33:23.601]  And he was the head guy that funded all that.
[01:33:24.461 --> 01:33:26.824]  And all they knew was they had advanced schematics that had been
[01:33:29.022 --> 01:33:34.686]  Imagine by Galton and Wedgwood and Huxley and Darwin in 1855.
[01:33:36.227 --> 01:33:38.669]  Advanced interbreeding program and all the rest of it.
[01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:39.930]  They had envisioned all this.
[01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:42.051]  So they had given it to the military.
[01:33:42.091 --> 01:33:45.814]  So the British military and the US military was supposed to build this.
[01:33:45.874 --> 01:33:46.975]  They're like, this is insane.
[01:33:46.995 --> 01:33:47.415]  What are we doing?
[01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:48.336]  But it actually got built.
[01:33:48.916 --> 01:33:52.739]  So whatever knowledge they got from over the other side, from old Beelzebub,
[01:33:53.479 --> 01:33:54.640]  This is actually history books.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:55.361]  I mean, don't believe me.
[01:33:55.381 --> 01:33:57.503]  If you're mainstream news, don't just write an article making fun of us.
[01:33:57.764 --> 01:33:58.224]  Go look it up.
[01:33:58.604 --> 01:34:08.815]  And so they were then able to start constructing this, but because there were monopolies in place and there were monopoly laws in place, Microsoft had to become the new front company.
[01:34:09.075 --> 01:34:12.279]  So there was a monopoly with IBM having the computers and the operating system.
[01:34:12.979 --> 01:34:18.382]  They were tax-free, tax-exempt, with a directive to take over the world and basically engage in this whole program.
[01:34:18.402 --> 01:34:22.784]  So you ask, how is Google set up by In-Q-Tel and the CIA within us?
[01:34:23.104 --> 01:34:36.852]  Google is, when it was set up in 1987, it's only like 18, 19 years old, it was set up as a search engine that the NSA already had for keywords and data where they would transcript all the phone calls.
[01:34:37.982 --> 01:34:41.385]  And they said, this is easy for searchability.
[01:34:41.786 --> 01:34:48.211]  Just apply this to the internet that's being set up and through databases we set up in front of the telecom hubs.
[01:34:48.672 --> 01:34:49.753]  This is all admitted now.
[01:34:50.033 --> 01:34:51.454]  We talk about 20 years ago, people didn't believe it.
[01:34:51.935 --> 01:34:52.895]  So it's really old news.
[01:34:54.557 --> 01:34:58.660]  And so that's how they ran this stuff through.
[01:34:59.261 --> 01:35:00.582]  And that's how they set all this up.
[01:35:00.622 --> 01:35:03.204]  So Twitter, Facebook.
[01:35:04.278 --> 01:35:11.741]  Apple, Google, and subsidiaries, all of these are people wanting to make money and run their lives and be people at the lower subsidiaries.
[01:35:12.141 --> 01:35:20.725]  But at the top, they're all, and this has actually come out in white papers, Bill Joy's written about it and Wired, you know, 16 years ago and others have, why the future doesn't need us.
[01:35:21.185 --> 01:35:23.346]  They admit that
[01:35:24.727 --> 01:35:25.667]  And it's kind of true.
[01:35:25.847 --> 01:35:32.629]  I mean, the public is dumbed down, wants to watch football, wants to just eat food and not work, isn't even involved in this.
[01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:41.572]  And I've been told, and I say this, and I'm not involved with these people, but I've been told by a banking head and other people, they said, Alex, it's very sad you've taken this course.
[01:35:41.892 --> 01:35:42.813]  They're not going to listen.
[01:35:42.893 --> 01:35:49.795]  But we kind of metaphysically believe it's your job to tell them all this is happening so that we have the right to do this to them.
[01:35:50.635 --> 01:35:54.958]  So they know vaccines have got cancer viruses and have liability protection.
[01:35:55.338 --> 01:35:58.140]  So they know that they're putting glyphosate in the water.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:59.781]  So they know you're killing you.
[01:36:00.142 --> 01:36:00.862]  So you know.
[01:36:00.982 --> 01:36:02.423]  And so you've kind of been told.
[01:36:02.983 --> 01:36:06.146]  And so I guess from their delusional perspective,
[01:36:06.826 --> 01:36:07.866]  But I believe in humanity.
[01:36:07.906 --> 01:36:08.787]  That's why they're so freaked out.
[01:36:08.827 --> 01:36:09.667]  Trump was supposed to lose.
[01:36:09.947 --> 01:36:13.869]  They had TV shows lined up showing he would lose, Madame President, all this demonization.
[01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:20.492]  He was supposed to lose, and we were supposed to be a joke, and I was supposed to be the example for ending free pests to be destroyed.
[01:36:21.645 --> 01:36:22.366]  That didn't happen.
[01:36:22.867 --> 01:36:25.690]  So now they've got to intimidate Trump, shut the whole thing down.
[01:36:25.710 --> 01:36:28.954]  And again, people say, why don't you tell us about these meetings you've had?
[01:36:29.354 --> 01:36:32.998]  Well, I mean, Buckley, you've been here when some of the top Hollywood producers come.
[01:36:33.018 --> 01:36:33.919]  They're not bad people.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:35.321]  They don't like what's happening.
[01:36:35.361 --> 01:36:38.645]  I mean, we're talking about people that make $200 million in productions a year.
[01:36:39.724 --> 01:36:40.325]  That's conservative.
[01:36:40.605 --> 01:36:44.669]  I mean, producers bigger than Chris Carter, who admits that he thinks I'm a great guy.
[01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:45.290]  I'm not bragging.
[01:36:45.310 --> 01:36:45.950]  The point is the truth.
[01:36:46.251 --> 01:36:48.073]  And his new X-Files is based on me to warn people.
[01:36:48.313 --> 01:36:50.715]  They said, oh, you got top ratings, maybe no new series, Chris.
[01:36:51.176 --> 01:36:54.860]  All his gravitas, and he can't get a series out because it's not anti-liberty.
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:55.360]  See?
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:57.522]  You understand how that works?
[01:36:58.519 --> 01:37:02.323]  And so top producers come and they say, yeah, we'll have all our funding and no production cut off.
[01:37:02.704 --> 01:37:03.785]  They ask me, what do we do?
[01:37:04.206 --> 01:37:07.109]  And I say, all I can do is interface with the public and defend internet freedom.
[01:37:07.449 --> 01:37:08.310]  I can't help you.
[01:37:08.631 --> 01:37:09.171]  I'm sorry.
[01:37:09.211 --> 01:37:10.473]  I'm not disrespecting you.
[01:37:10.673 --> 01:37:11.414]  I can't help you.
[01:37:11.794 --> 01:37:12.715]  They're like, what do we do?
[01:37:12.795 --> 01:37:13.756]  I say, I don't know.
[01:37:14.665 --> 01:37:15.565]  Okay, I don't know.
[01:37:15.825 --> 01:37:20.887]  Well, we've got $100 million waiting for you, and we want you to come to this event and meet with us.
[01:37:21.987 --> 01:37:23.287]  Yoko Ono asked me to do that.
[01:37:23.707 --> 01:37:25.168]  Shawn Lennon, I'm saying these names now.
[01:37:25.688 --> 01:37:26.248]  I can't do it.
[01:37:26.408 --> 01:37:34.690]  I just can't go meet with top, you know, shaman that are battling the Illuminati, their top advisors to world royalty, six, seven years ago, because that's all part of the same thing.
[01:37:34.951 --> 01:37:36.071]  I'm not saying Yoko Ono's bad.
[01:37:36.551 --> 01:37:39.512]  It's that she went to the meetings and didn't even care who I was.
[01:37:40.612 --> 01:37:48.058]  With Sean Lennon and other people, you know, Madonna, all of them, and they said, we must have Alex Jones because Alex Jones is going to overthrow this whole thing.
[01:37:48.318 --> 01:37:49.319]  And it wasn't about me.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.802]  It was the simple spirit that I wouldn't be part of their system.
[01:37:53.563 --> 01:37:55.885]  So it's not that Hollywood's bad.
[01:37:55.945 --> 01:37:56.685]  They're leaderless.
[01:37:57.146 --> 01:37:59.908]  They're bullied by like 95 year old or whatever it is.
[01:38:00.408 --> 01:38:01.369]  How old son of a redstone.
[01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:04.632]  You know, I've been on the, I've been there when they're about to put the film out.
[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:14.309]  And Mark Cuban calls up on the speakerphone and goes, I just got threatened they're going to indict me for Securities and Exchange Commission for talking about putting out your film on a thousand screens.
[01:38:15.010 --> 01:38:16.071]  Blue Exchange Second Edition.
[01:38:17.569 --> 01:38:21.232]  And it's not like I have to talk about Hollywood like we've just arrived or something.
[01:38:21.252 --> 01:38:23.473]  It's that that's the point people go through that.
[01:38:23.853 --> 01:38:25.054]  And then they went after Mark Cuban.
[01:38:25.254 --> 01:38:26.175]  He released the emails.
[01:38:26.455 --> 01:38:27.956]  He released the phone records where they threatened him.
[01:38:28.296 --> 01:38:29.397]  And they finally dropped him.
[01:38:29.657 --> 01:38:30.478]  He rolled over though.
[01:38:30.978 --> 01:38:31.739]  And don't blame Mark.
[01:38:31.779 --> 01:38:32.079]  I get it.
[01:38:32.099 --> 01:38:33.060]  He's got billions of dollars.
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:33.880]  Enjoy yourself.
[01:38:34.321 --> 01:38:35.822]  You know, you're down scared to go after Trump.
[01:38:36.662 --> 01:38:38.643]  It's that this isn't trying to impress you folks.
[01:38:39.064 --> 01:38:40.104]  This is the real world.
[01:38:40.725 --> 01:38:44.848]  I had the head of the Democratic Party in Texas call me in 1996.
[01:38:48.604 --> 01:38:50.346]  And say, come meet with me.
[01:38:50.686 --> 01:38:53.329]  This is where Buckley had helped me get started, but he wouldn't even work with me then.
[01:38:53.729 --> 01:38:58.595]  And I went and met at a steakhouse with the head of the Democratic Party, and they said, Lee, you've got a lot of talent.
[01:38:58.975 --> 01:39:00.276]  We can run you for office.
[01:39:00.877 --> 01:39:02.238]  Stop attacking the Clintons.
[01:39:02.679 --> 01:39:04.941]  We want to see you go on air tomorrow night on AXS TV.
[01:39:04.961 --> 01:39:06.143]  It wasn't even on radio yet.
[01:39:06.463 --> 01:39:06.823]  It's like 96, 97.
[01:39:06.903 --> 01:39:08.285]  It's radio 96, social 96.
[01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:14.312]  And they call up and they go, you son of a bitch, we're going to kill you.
[01:39:15.073 --> 01:39:17.715]  How dare you talk about him in the Communist Chinese?
[01:39:17.835 --> 01:39:18.436]  Join us!
[01:39:19.196 --> 01:39:20.478]  And I don't say that to act tough.
[01:39:20.938 --> 01:39:27.984]  This is what I've already done to get here, to reach 40, 50 million people a week, for real, to not sell out.
[01:39:28.065 --> 01:39:30.727]  These, everybody else got that call.
[01:39:31.648 --> 01:39:32.709]  They said, we'll go to D.C.
[01:39:32.729 --> 01:39:33.890]  You're going to meet with the president.
[01:39:35.393 --> 01:39:36.134]  It's going to be great.
[01:39:36.154 --> 01:39:37.535]  You're going to be a big star, Alex.
[01:39:37.996 --> 01:39:39.417]  The president wants to meet with you.
[01:39:39.577 --> 01:39:47.244]  I know other conservative top news bloggers that got that call and they went and they had that meeting.
[01:39:48.385 --> 01:39:51.408]  And they make $100 million a year profit.
[01:39:51.428 --> 01:39:52.029]  It's not Drudge.
[01:39:52.049 --> 01:39:52.529]  He didn't do it.
[01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:54.231]  Drudge said, hell no.
[01:39:55.092 --> 01:39:56.033]  That's why Drudge is in hiding.
[01:39:57.054 --> 01:39:59.616]  Almost everyone else bowed to that.
[01:39:59.636 --> 01:40:00.357]  Now let me explain something.
[01:40:01.718 --> 01:40:10.150]  100 million a year that a certain person has been paid for a decade for backing off the Clintons.
[01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:10.511]  100 million.
[01:40:10.731 --> 01:40:12.474]  That is like rat shit to me.
[01:40:14.005 --> 01:40:15.246]  People are like, oh god, that's a lot of money.
[01:40:15.466 --> 01:40:20.188]  Yeah, I could have a lot of Bentleys and a lot of jerks that don't love me and be around a bunch of fake people.
[01:40:20.588 --> 01:40:23.169]  I'm telling you all this because this has asked me anything.
[01:40:23.769 --> 01:40:24.729]  This doesn't impress you.
[01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:26.010]  This is truth hour.
[01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:27.631]  This is where we are.
[01:40:28.071 --> 01:40:29.952]  This is because the hammer's coming down.
[01:40:30.372 --> 01:40:31.652]  This is a skyfall.
[01:40:31.933 --> 01:40:33.313]  This is the end of my work.
[01:40:33.753 --> 01:40:36.995]  Potentially waves are coming in that I recognize.
[01:40:38.075 --> 01:40:39.195]  Or the end of who I am.
[01:40:39.215 --> 01:40:40.596]  But that's okay.
[01:40:41.276 --> 01:40:47.118]  As long as you know that we're not going to submit to these people, you live on and have great victories.
[01:40:47.738 --> 01:40:51.479]  I will never be a minion of these sacks of evil.
[01:40:52.319 --> 01:40:55.000]  I will never submit to them to hurt innocents.
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:41:00.762]  These selfish, demonic creatures that are sold out to everything wicked.
[01:41:01.223 --> 01:41:03.564]  We don't want to be with them.
[01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:15.590]  We want to be with families, and babies, and feast, and life, and the stars, and Valhalla, and goodness, and honor, and strength.
[01:41:15.630 --> 01:41:19.311]  We don't want to be with people that work against humanity.
[01:41:21.312 --> 01:41:24.114]  We want to be where life is.
[01:41:26.198 --> 01:41:39.948]  And so, I remember a pastor once told me, not at church, but a fella I knew, he said, you know, Christ said, what would you give your whole soul?
[01:41:39.968 --> 01:41:42.851]  You know, to be given this world, what would you do?
[01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:45.492]  And then you're like, oh, I'll give my soul for that.
[01:41:45.853 --> 01:41:47.054]  Your soul is your whole being.
[01:41:48.034 --> 01:41:52.598]  To be in some mansion or to strut around and have a bunch of empty people think you're God, that's a torture.
[01:41:54.582 --> 01:41:56.102]  But see, the average person feels weak.
[01:41:56.342 --> 01:41:57.383]  That means everything to them.
[01:41:57.663 --> 01:41:58.963]  Even if they're not evil, it's acceptance.
[01:41:59.383 --> 01:42:01.984]  True godliness is not caring what the world thinks.
[01:42:04.564 --> 01:42:09.485]  But so many people that are godly are so removed from the world, they don't even know how to see the world.
[01:42:10.365 --> 01:42:14.666]  And it takes fallen people like me to be able to see it and understand it.
[01:42:15.807 --> 01:42:22.268]  But if you sit there and you look into this and you study this, you realize it's all a mind trick.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:27.681]  That anybody that actually had knowledge of this would never join with this.
[01:42:28.221 --> 01:42:37.003]  What we're offered, what we potentially can have, isn't just life extension in this body.
[01:42:37.103 --> 01:42:42.043]  You'll be so ascendant, you'll already be dead by the minute you become conscious.
[01:42:43.264 --> 01:42:44.184]  You were already there.
[01:42:47.244 --> 01:42:49.765]  You won't even care anymore about this body.
[01:42:54.232 --> 01:42:54.973]  That's what's so sad.
[01:42:54.993 --> 01:42:57.174]  The whole universe, God, is waiting for you.
[01:42:57.194 --> 01:42:58.795]  It's God's free will.
[01:42:58.835 --> 01:42:59.816]  God's not like the devil.
[01:43:00.377 --> 01:43:02.238]  God's not going to twist you or lie to you.
[01:43:02.998 --> 01:43:06.241]  The enemy's going to set up churches that say they're God to mislead you.
[01:43:06.301 --> 01:43:07.682]  God's waiting right now.
[01:43:08.222 --> 01:43:11.465]  But you've just got to have the free will to join God and say, I want justice.
[01:43:11.985 --> 01:43:12.766]  I want to be pure.
[01:43:12.786 --> 01:43:14.127]  I want to be strong.
[01:43:15.468 --> 01:43:16.528]  And then it is eternity.
[01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:21.553]  But God can't make creatures and not give them free will.
[01:43:22.013 --> 01:43:24.055]  God can't make slaves.
[01:43:25.096 --> 01:43:27.478]  The devil turns God's children into slaves.
[01:43:28.019 --> 01:43:39.269]  God's waiting right now for you, ready for you to accept eternity, ready for you to step into all the promises and all the great work that has to be done.
[01:43:39.809 --> 01:43:43.232]  God's there, waiting with His hand out, right now.
[01:43:44.369 --> 01:43:46.290]  And the enemy wants to steal that from you.
[01:43:46.650 --> 01:43:52.512]  They sold out everything they were for power during this 10 second joke that is this test.
[01:43:54.852 --> 01:43:56.373]  You don't want to be with them forever.
[01:43:57.994 --> 01:43:59.414]  God doesn't put you in hell.
[01:44:00.074 --> 01:44:02.015]  You choose to be with these people.
[01:44:04.536 --> 01:44:11.218]  That their ultimate power is grabbing a kid out of their backyard and taking them in some dungeon and scaring the hell out of them for a couple days.
[01:44:13.086 --> 01:44:27.551]  And do the most horrible crap they can because it freaks out these evil people so much to rebel against God as they bounce off the walls of eternity that they believe this must be power because they could do stuff like this when all they're doing is vandalizing their very soul.
[01:44:27.811 --> 01:44:29.592]  They're not hurting those innocents.
[01:44:29.852 --> 01:44:33.253]  God protects their souls the instant they're in the clutches of the spider.
[01:44:34.874 --> 01:44:38.895]  And all the enemy drinks in believing his power is damnation and hell.
[01:44:42.756 --> 01:44:58.465]  The truth is, I've seen in, through, and beyond, and everybody else can see it as well, and they know all these Chris Hedges, and all these cowards, and all these sad fallen people that laugh at this and think this is a joke.
[01:45:01.026 --> 01:45:02.127]  These are people we lost.
[01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:09.251]  So stop feeling like you're a failure because you're not driving the newest car.
[01:45:11.806 --> 01:45:13.718]  Or you're not wearing a Rolex on your arm.
[01:45:15.031 --> 01:45:18.793]  Or because other men sit there and giggle and look down on you when you walk past them?
[01:45:19.374 --> 01:45:20.034]  None of that matters.
[01:45:20.174 --> 01:45:36.204]  I wear a blue sports coat and a Rolex because it's a symbol of middle class and humanity having prosperity and promoting human prosperity from a perspective of empowering humanity and stealing the image of a man in a sports jacket with a Rolex that is the satanic image.
[01:45:36.505 --> 01:45:43.309]  So I dress as a satanist so that I can enter their world and show you that none of it means anything.
[01:45:44.730 --> 01:45:47.391]  It's your soul, not a Rolex that has value.
[01:45:48.411 --> 01:45:56.213]  It's your soul, not if you've got these crazy rich people with all their Botox and their things, trying to look sexy and young, and trying to be powerful.
[01:45:56.413 --> 01:45:58.013]  One of the ugliest people I've ever seen!
[01:45:59.093 --> 01:45:59.854]  Totally alone!
[01:46:00.354 --> 01:46:01.414]  Without God forever!
[01:46:02.194 --> 01:46:02.974]  That's why I have no fear.
[01:46:05.395 --> 01:46:13.417]  I'm gonna play a tape and come back and take more questions, but... You know, I get pissed, and I sit there, and I look at how hard we work,
[01:46:15.066 --> 01:46:20.768]  To have about $3.5 million in 2017 to get offices in D.C.
[01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:32.912]  and hire 10 more reporters and camera people and try to, I mean God, I love to spoil my crew, try to give them more money so they can have a better life, drive a nicer car for the hard work they do and take care of their kids.
[01:46:34.733 --> 01:46:37.434]  And I watch a bunch of people that claim they're against discrimination.
[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:49.223]  And claim they're all about civil rights, dehumanize us, and tell us that we don't count, and that we're just blown into oblivion and put in some electronic ghetto.
[01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:56.605]  That shows me how smart Matt Grudge was when he came here personally, but also when he said, Alex, I get it, you gotta be on these platforms, but they're all going away soon.
[01:46:57.206 --> 01:47:01.447]  They use you, they use your strength, they use everything your audience does to empower them, they track them.
[01:47:01.747 --> 01:47:03.187]  We gotta build our own things, Alex.
[01:47:03.207 --> 01:47:04.988]  And it's so true.
[01:47:07.915 --> 01:47:18.818]  Yeah, we've had some success on Facebook and Google and Twitter, but... I mean, Paul Watson's got more imprints on Twitter than the BBC does, and now they're trying to block him.
[01:47:19.719 --> 01:47:25.100]  And imagine that one guy from England that I hired 16 years ago, because I saw his soul, I saw his talent.
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.841]  He's so committed, he works 18 hours a day in his little place in London.
[01:47:33.023 --> 01:47:34.123]  But still, he's there.
[01:47:35.483 --> 01:47:37.144]  Dominating on their platform.
[01:47:38.092 --> 01:47:38.512]  Reaching.
[01:47:39.493 --> 01:47:43.136]  His Twitter impressions are 27 million a day.
[01:47:44.096 --> 01:47:45.277]  Hundreds of millions a week.
[01:47:46.078 --> 01:47:50.341]  He is just, with common sense and with everything, annihilating them.
[01:47:50.841 --> 01:48:05.192]  But still, Paul is so cynical about the power structure and cynical about the lies we made to go to church when he was a kid in Sheffield that I just pray that, I pray that like Saul on the road to Damascus become
[01:48:08.459 --> 01:48:33.182]  Paul on the road to Damascus and that because I've always known I'm gonna give you the greatest message from the day I began when I was like 16 years old and I'd be at parties and I wasn't even into drugs but I'd be with a cheerleader and you know at the pole party and your mom would be sitting there snorting cocaine off you know the table and there'd be a 50 kids there and college people and in would come
[01:48:34.531 --> 01:48:38.474]  A sheriff's department car and they'd come in and sell bags of drugs to people.
[01:48:38.594 --> 01:48:40.376]  That's before we moved down here to Austin because of it.
[01:48:40.936 --> 01:48:47.162]  And I went to school when they were having an auditorium meeting about drug testing and stuff and they had, they had cops up there that I knew were drug dealers.
[01:48:47.262 --> 01:48:49.364]  I stood up and I said, I was at a pool party.
[01:48:49.724 --> 01:48:52.066]  He was selling cocaine in ecstasy last week.
[01:48:53.271 --> 01:49:00.875]  They took me in an office, ran my head in the wall, told me, we're gonna kill you and have black people with foot-long dicks rape you in the ass tomorrow.
[01:49:01.176 --> 01:49:03.357]  I'm not black and biting black people, that's what they told me.
[01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:06.599]  If you don't shut up, and you know what?
[01:49:07.319 --> 01:49:08.860]  I didn't show up, and I called my dad.
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:14.203]  He had enough connections where they knew to back off, but they said, you're gonna move out of this town right now.
[01:49:14.483 --> 01:49:20.727]  But right after we left, the FBI busted them all shipping cocaine and heroin and marijuana out of that airport.
[01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:24.035]  And it wasn't that I just was perfect.
[01:49:26.736 --> 01:49:30.016]  But there were good people in the government.
[01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:37.178]  And they made sure that everybody that shot their mouth off against me, a couple of them got broken jaws.
[01:49:37.258 --> 01:49:38.658]  And it's not about a pissing contest.
[01:49:39.558 --> 01:49:45.959]  The difference was, you're not going to sell drugs to kids and then sit there and try to envelop them in their system of BS.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.380]  And I can just go back to all of it.
[01:49:49.502 --> 01:49:52.343]  The difference is, I wanted justice.
[01:49:52.844 --> 01:49:54.585]  And I wanted to be a good person.
[01:49:55.225 --> 01:49:57.306]  And I wanted to stand up for what was right.
[01:49:58.086 --> 01:49:59.887]  And I wanted to change the world.
[01:49:59.967 --> 01:50:01.168]  And I did change the world.
[01:50:01.268 --> 01:50:02.269]  And you changed the world.
[01:50:02.749 --> 01:50:05.070]  And we don't have to let evil people run things anymore.
[01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:07.431]  We don't have to turn things over to them.
[01:50:07.491 --> 01:50:15.215]  And all they've done to me, all the things they've done to my family, it's beyond any movie.
[01:50:15.735 --> 01:50:17.596]  And I'm not complaining about it.
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:26.166]  I'm not going to give them the satisfaction they want, because in the final equation, they're going to fail.
[01:50:26.706 --> 01:50:32.191]  And my will, and your will, our will, is going to overcome them.
[01:50:33.993 --> 01:50:36.135]  And that's what people have to understand, is this is real.
[01:50:36.775 --> 01:50:42.841]  It's so chattel to sit up here and jack around and worry about money and worry about
[01:50:44.531 --> 01:50:45.332]  We're good to go.
[01:51:02.202 --> 01:51:11.589]  But I want you, I mean, imagine the problem of you sell 10,000 Roger Stone books, and nothing against Roger Stone, he's overwhelmed, doing 15 interviews a day, he doesn't sign all the cards!
[01:51:11.869 --> 01:51:14.211]  He says on air, he's gonna sign the cards!
[01:51:15.913 --> 01:51:19.375]  And then you sell 10,000 in a week, and he doesn't sign the cards!
[01:51:19.615 --> 01:51:23.859]  And then everybody's bitching, you didn't sign the cards, where is my book, where is my signed thing?
[01:51:24.119 --> 01:51:30.444]  And we're like trying to, I'm not bitching, I'm just telling you, those are the issues we sit there and we deal with every day.
[01:51:31.690 --> 01:51:32.610]  Trying to be moral.
[01:51:32.630 --> 01:51:34.131]  See, that's why it's so easy to be evil.
[01:51:34.491 --> 01:51:36.132]  Oh, let's just blow everything up and rule it.
[01:51:36.432 --> 01:51:39.434]  You know, let's not care anymore what we do to people.
[01:51:39.574 --> 01:51:40.294]  It's so easy.
[01:51:40.574 --> 01:51:41.235]  You're smart.
[01:51:41.455 --> 01:51:42.195]  You have power.
[01:51:42.375 --> 01:51:42.815]  Rule them.
[01:51:43.056 --> 01:51:43.656]  Dominate them.
[01:51:43.836 --> 01:51:44.356]  Destroy them.
[01:51:44.796 --> 01:51:45.357]  Here's the difference.
[01:51:46.197 --> 01:51:54.121]  The minute I even think about doing that and start having delusions about how great I am and all the things
[01:51:58.206 --> 01:52:02.790]  And I see my soul being shuttered from the whole future of humanity, and it's a lie.
[01:52:03.691 --> 01:52:04.231]  So know this.
[01:52:05.953 --> 01:52:12.119]  In the whole history of humanity, and the whole history of your short life, all you are is the connection to those that came before you.
[01:52:15.361 --> 01:52:20.266]  And I fundamentally believe in humanity.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:34.147]  And The Globalist, they put out movies like The Devil's Advocate with Al Pacino, a great actor, where the devil says he's a fan of humanity and is trying to stop God not letting us have a good time.
[01:52:34.167 --> 01:52:34.847]  That's all a lie.
[01:52:34.967 --> 01:52:36.608]  God gives you the woman, the man.
[01:52:36.908 --> 01:52:44.032]  God gives you the children, the honor, the will, the courage, the life, the planet that's green, the oceans that are blue, the sky.
[01:52:44.312 --> 01:52:45.193]  God gave you all that.
[01:52:45.473 --> 01:52:47.034]  The devil wants to hijack that lie.
[01:52:47.974 --> 01:52:48.675]  No one thing.
[01:52:48.755 --> 01:52:50.656]  The devil is not a fan of humanity.
[01:52:51.823 --> 01:53:00.871]  Because the devil, as Genesis tells us, is fallen.
[01:53:01.892 --> 01:53:04.014]  And humanity is made in the image of God.
[01:53:04.254 --> 01:53:05.535]  Look at all we already built.
[01:53:06.156 --> 01:53:07.397]  Look at what we can manifest.
[01:53:07.437 --> 01:53:10.860]  Look what some guy, when he was 20 years old, could build in Texas.
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:16.925]  Can you imagine what we can do if we aren't out to get people?
[01:53:16.945 --> 01:53:17.946]  Because here's the great secret.
[01:53:19.272 --> 01:53:24.175]  If we're out to get people, it'll be blown up and destroyed to fail, for sure.
[01:53:24.476 --> 01:53:25.356]  The Atlantean mystery.
[01:53:25.777 --> 01:53:31.501]  But if we try as hard as we can, and are as open as we can, we may not succeed.
[01:53:32.842 --> 01:53:35.123]  Because God puts out a lot of stuff.
[01:53:37.605 --> 01:53:39.146]  And not all of it's going to succeed.
[01:53:40.427 --> 01:53:43.269]  So, don't think you're as elite as you think you are.
[01:53:44.366 --> 01:53:54.435]  The truth is, you have to know there's a higher power, and all of you that serve the God of this world have to dial in to that power, and then you'll find fulfillment.
[01:53:55.556 --> 01:53:58.579]  I guarantee you, Zuckerberg, Schmidt, all of them, I can take one look at them.
[01:53:58.879 --> 01:53:59.920]  Those are empty husks.
[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:01.762]  Hillary, look at them.
[01:54:02.162 --> 01:54:03.944]  Those people are vassals.
[01:54:04.784 --> 01:54:05.545]  They're instruments.
[01:54:05.585 --> 01:54:06.266]  They're gone.
[01:54:07.187 --> 01:54:08.648]  You can't even reach out to them.
[01:54:10.754 --> 01:54:12.214]  You are who matters.
[01:54:12.715 --> 01:54:23.058]  It's your soul and the decision you make that for space and time and a Zen sense for the full continuum in the ninth dimension beyond that is now being decided.
[01:54:23.338 --> 01:54:24.278]  That's the big test.
[01:54:24.878 --> 01:54:25.999]  Now I could pontificate all day.
[01:54:26.039 --> 01:54:29.360]  Let's air this clip, then I'm going to come back and take like 20 questions rapid fire.
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:31.580]  I know a million of them have been waiting all night to come on.
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:34.461]  We're going to get them back on and take some phone calls here on air.
[01:54:34.501 --> 01:54:35.802]  But you want to know what I really stand for?
[01:54:35.822 --> 01:54:36.802]  That's what I stand for.
[01:54:37.082 --> 01:54:38.284]  Do I calculate my statements?
[01:54:38.304 --> 01:54:41.148]  Do I care what's in, you know, the demonization media?
[01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.409]  No.
[01:54:41.729 --> 01:54:42.350]  That's the enemy.
[01:54:44.273 --> 01:54:48.059]  And we have like Associated Press, Reuters, New York Times, Raw Story attack us.
[01:54:48.823 --> 01:54:51.044]  We'll get like 10,000 visitors office.
[01:54:51.605 --> 01:55:05.312]  I go on some little Florida rock and roll station or I go on some little Christian station in Idaho and I see people that never leave us and take action because I talk to them for 30 minutes or an hour and it's a real communication.
[01:55:05.652 --> 01:55:06.813]  It's a real connection.
[01:55:06.953 --> 01:55:12.075]  Everything the enemy does is to cut things and to twist things and to try to make sure they distort it.
[01:55:12.796 --> 01:55:14.737]  So yeah, there's a distorted Alex Jones out there.
[01:55:15.967 --> 01:55:17.689]  The real Alex Jones is even more distorted.
[01:55:18.250 --> 01:55:21.133]  But behind it is a light that wants you to succeed.
[01:55:21.934 --> 01:55:23.536]  And that's why they don't want you to see that.
[01:55:24.378 --> 01:55:25.799]  Because they've created the false light.
[01:55:27.922 --> 01:55:33.529]  The light of greedy, inbred people.
[01:55:34.758 --> 01:55:35.138]  That's right.
[01:55:54.444 --> 01:55:55.385]  And what do you think's in there?
[01:55:55.425 --> 01:55:56.445]  The turmeric, all of it.
[01:55:56.505 --> 01:56:01.748]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:02.309 --> 01:56:03.769]  Because we're a long way to go.
[01:56:03.969 --> 01:56:07.051]  You know, $5 billion this year we've made off this Google Ads.
[01:56:07.792 --> 01:56:12.314]  Just selling water filters and pictures of Ronald Reagan.
[01:56:13.095 --> 01:56:15.416]  In America, that's hateful and you're not supposed to do it.
[01:56:16.238 --> 01:56:19.681]  So it's all available at InfoWarsTore.com, limited edition, not on front prints.
[01:56:20.022 --> 01:56:24.646]  The second roll of those, different print, different color, different paper, but then it's done with those images.
[01:56:25.066 --> 01:56:26.388]  First time we've had this Reagan print.
[01:56:27.208 --> 01:56:30.331]  And it's all there, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:30.392 --> 01:56:38.880]  I'd love to come in here, maybe if I came in here tomorrow and said, we made the five million back, you know, and gross, it'd be like half that in profit, to fund the operation.
[01:56:39.775 --> 01:56:40.796]  They're not even coming for more.
[01:56:40.836 --> 01:56:46.881]  You know, maybe they have their victory, they shut us down, they take this away from us, they blacklist us, we're not human, whatever.
[01:56:47.562 --> 01:56:52.006]  They got free water filters when you get the three-month supply of high-quality storable foods with Alexa Pure.
[01:56:52.466 --> 01:56:54.788]  Infowarsstore.com, 888-253-3139.
[01:56:55.509 --> 01:57:04.857]  But whatever you do, whatever you do, spread the links to everybody you know, because they convince you nothing's real, even yourself.
[01:57:06.937 --> 01:57:07.477]  I am real.
[01:57:07.517 --> 01:57:08.418]  What I'm saying is real.
[01:57:08.458 --> 01:57:09.279]  What we've done is real.
[01:57:09.599 --> 01:57:11.480]  The globalists attacking us all over the world is real.
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:13.422]  The president attacking the new world order being real.
[01:57:13.642 --> 01:57:15.823]  Bringing God back in, saying it's anti-human.
[01:57:16.044 --> 01:57:17.545]  We must declare the birthright of God.
[01:57:17.765 --> 01:57:19.066]  We must ask for God's protection.
[01:57:19.366 --> 01:57:22.128]  Trump is in there saying desperately, call God in right now!
[01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:23.629]  God, I'm barely holding him back!
[01:57:23.969 --> 01:57:24.890]  Bring him in right now!
[01:57:27.188 --> 01:57:29.731]  High-level occult practitioners that aren't on the dark side.
[01:57:30.231 --> 01:57:33.855]  I had, you know, people on today, they're like, no, this is dangerous.
[01:57:33.875 --> 01:57:34.775]  What Trump's doing is real.
[01:57:35.236 --> 01:57:37.038]  This is a pro-human movement.
[01:57:40.721 --> 01:57:45.085]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip here and we'll come back and take like 15 comments and some calls.
[01:57:46.718 --> 01:57:50.459]  Who should we talk to first?
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:53.801]  Special report, what Somalia got wrong, the truth about Sweden.
[01:57:55.321 --> 01:58:00.043]  John Bowne, seditious death cult declares, we are liberal, get used to it.
[01:58:00.423 --> 01:58:04.664]  This is a John Bowne report, and I'll come back with a bunch of your questions from Reddit.
[01:58:05.444 --> 01:58:07.305]  Ask me anything, you're certainly getting the answers tonight.
[01:58:07.785 --> 01:58:09.346]  And again, we've seen huge censorship on Reddit.
[01:58:09.366 --> 01:58:12.907]  The conservatives and liberals and libertarians are so nice, they're like,
[01:58:13.407 --> 01:58:14.287]  Because they're the real liberals.
[01:58:14.547 --> 01:58:15.568]  They're like, oh, they're censoring us.
[01:58:15.608 --> 01:58:16.128]  It's okay.
[01:58:16.268 --> 01:58:16.528]  Oh, yeah.
[01:58:17.048 --> 01:58:18.268]  How do we build something different?
[01:58:18.288 --> 01:58:19.588]  Or how do we make Reddit stop?
[01:58:19.628 --> 01:58:21.429]  Or how do we point out what they're up to?
[01:58:21.469 --> 01:58:24.710]  You know, instead of just letting them always engineer and admit they're blocking.
[01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:26.710]  That's another question for them I want to ask them.
[01:58:26.890 --> 01:58:28.311]  You know, are they blocking this thing tonight?
[01:58:28.971 --> 01:58:29.731]  Going on their main page?
[01:58:29.751 --> 01:58:30.551]  I don't know.
[01:58:30.591 --> 01:58:32.372]  It says, I know they compartmentalize it on the Donald.
[01:58:32.392 --> 01:58:33.212]  We should ask people that.
[01:58:33.532 --> 01:58:34.592]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[01:58:34.632 --> 01:58:35.712]  I'm done pontificating.
[01:58:36.032 --> 01:58:37.673]  Got the crew that's been in there for 14 hours.
[01:58:37.713 --> 01:58:38.073]  Here we go.
[01:58:39.173 --> 01:58:42.274]  There's this big hoax, like everything else, that
[01:58:43.283 --> 01:58:44.764]  Trump's trying to limit the press!
[01:58:45.724 --> 01:58:48.426]  There's no legislation, no one calling for it.
[01:58:49.566 --> 01:59:06.616]  Obama signed the NDAA for 2018-2017, it overlaps, saying they were going to put the CIA over the Board of Governors of the FCC and start censoring, quote, fake news, and they're all over the news calling for censoring me and shutting down fake news.
[01:59:06.636 --> 01:59:10.518]  I was talking to this New York Times writer this weekend who wrote a big story about me that's in the paper today.
[01:59:12.779 --> 01:59:14.321]  He was like, we don't call for censorship.
[01:59:14.341 --> 01:59:21.466]  I go, here's a bunch of your articles I'm looking at where you say Facebook's gotta block fake news and I'm listed in here in articles you've written.
[01:59:22.127 --> 01:59:32.155]  And then I read other articles where you are writing about and saying that Trump's trying to censor the press all because he's criticizing you.
[01:59:32.595 --> 01:59:36.018]  The left always says if they attack you and you speak back, hey, my free speech.
[01:59:36.478 --> 01:59:38.520]  My speech doesn't end just because I offend you.
[01:59:39.287 --> 01:59:41.688]  Me disagreeing with you is coming back at you.
[01:59:41.868 --> 01:59:42.449]  Understand that?
[01:59:43.089 --> 01:59:47.952]  And Jim actually wrote a halfway accurate report for the New York Times.
[01:59:48.092 --> 01:59:49.772]  Roger Stone said he's one of the fairer people he knows.
[01:59:50.053 --> 01:59:52.054]  He did an overall good job getting some of the facts straight.
[01:59:52.414 --> 01:59:54.395]  But you read his other articles, which I read a bunch of them.
[01:59:54.455 --> 01:59:55.936]  I mean, it is just the same thing.
[01:59:55.976 --> 01:59:57.236]  We've got to censor fake news.
[01:59:57.476 --> 02:00:00.298]  And my name is listed in there as an example of that.
[02:00:00.658 --> 02:00:10.027]  So they're the ones calling for censoring us, and then they turn it around and say that Trump's trying to do it, with absolutely zero evidence of it.
[02:00:10.567 --> 02:00:13.851]  It's this upside-down world that's getting pushed, and it's crazy.
[02:00:14.711 --> 02:00:16.773]  Meanwhile, the economy is exploding.
[02:00:17.794 --> 02:00:24.461]  They are weaponizing news and information and dumbing it down to a childlike level.
[02:00:25.919 --> 02:00:30.504]  Because this entire globalist program is about emotions and childlike level control.
[02:00:31.826 --> 02:00:37.512]  And so when they come out and say, nothing's happened in Sweden, Trump's a big liar, they think you're stupid.
[02:00:37.532 --> 02:00:41.997]  There's a giant controversy in Sweden over all the different abusive things that have been happening there.
[02:00:42.497 --> 02:00:43.358]  We have new footage.
[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:52.966]  A feminist marches where the entire march stops and observes silence during the call to prayer and to Allah Akbar.
[02:00:55.068 --> 02:01:08.657]  You cannot make this up.
[02:01:09.157 --> 02:01:10.378]  And again, this is a fetish.
[02:01:10.398 --> 02:01:11.259]  This is a cuckolding.
[02:01:12.469 --> 02:01:19.974]  They see this as really anti-Christian, anti-freedom, anti-West, anti-open society, and so the groups leading these are Islamic.
[02:01:20.194 --> 02:01:21.455]  You can go look it up in Paul's article.
[02:01:21.895 --> 02:01:30.161]  They hand out these plastic hijabs that women then put on by the thousands, and then they put it on the news saying, look how beautiful this is.
[02:01:30.821 --> 02:01:31.562]  And then J-Lo
[02:01:32.782 --> 02:01:35.903]  Says, how dare Trump want to keep people from coming into the United States?
[02:01:36.243 --> 02:01:37.864]  Yeah, we'll go to Somalia, J-Lo.
[02:01:38.724 --> 02:01:41.425]  And don't worry, a bunch of Somalis are getting let in right now.
[02:01:41.445 --> 02:01:42.445]  Unvetted.
[02:01:47.887 --> 02:01:51.568]  They don't let women do the call to prayer under any Islamic system.
[02:01:51.928 --> 02:01:54.589]  So all of it is just completely upside down cuckoo land.
[02:02:00.791 --> 02:02:01.851]  What do their signs say?
[02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:03.992]  Dismantle white supremacy.
[02:02:05.252 --> 02:02:09.614]  Everything is anti-white, anti-West, even though almost every one of them is white.
[02:02:10.294 --> 02:02:11.915]  This is mass mental illness.
[02:02:12.855 --> 02:02:14.496]  This is what you pay for at the colleges.
[02:02:14.956 --> 02:02:15.816]  This is what goes on.
[02:02:16.336 --> 02:02:23.139]  And you see the type of women, and I'm not bashing women out to the like, women, give me a break, please don't put me on your level of being obsessed with what, you know, sexuality somebody is.
[02:02:24.807 --> 02:02:31.914]  These are the type of women that will come up to your good-looking wife, your girlfriend, whatever, in Austin and start hitting on them in front of you.
[02:02:32.594 --> 02:02:33.395]  And they can't even believe it.
[02:02:33.415 --> 02:02:34.376]  They're like, hey, back up.
[02:02:34.596 --> 02:02:36.077]  They're like, whoa, I'm politically correct.
[02:02:36.378 --> 02:02:36.918]  I'm royal.
[02:02:37.919 --> 02:02:40.241]  If a man wants to compete on a women's team, he can.
[02:02:40.281 --> 02:02:43.104]  If a woman wants to take steroids to compete on a women's team, she can.
[02:02:43.124 --> 02:02:45.466]  If a man wants to go in a women's bathroom, he can.
[02:02:45.706 --> 02:02:46.267]  Vice versa.
[02:02:47.321 --> 02:02:57.705]  And Nambla says if they want to pick your five-year-old up out of the backyard, if your five-year-old says they want to go because they're promising a candy or a puppy or video games, that you shouldn't be able to under law.
[02:02:58.125 --> 02:03:00.846]  And the pedophiles argue we won't have to take them to a slave dungeon.
[02:03:01.186 --> 02:03:02.546]  We might let them live, you see.
[02:03:02.586 --> 02:03:07.428]  If you just let us have sex with them, we won't have to kill them and throw them in a shallow grave.
[02:03:08.388 --> 02:03:10.169]  It's your fault we got to kill kids.
[02:03:10.829 --> 02:03:11.509]  We're liberal.
[02:03:11.789 --> 02:03:12.270]  You're not.
[02:03:12.370 --> 02:03:13.070]  Get used to it.
[02:03:21.886 --> 02:03:32.299]  I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you Alex, you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:34.361]  In a big way.
[02:03:34.562 --> 02:03:36.264]  If you're calling it media, fine.
[02:03:36.304 --> 02:03:38.146]  If you're calling it sports, whatever it is.
[02:03:38.687 --> 02:03:40.269]  But you've got to be the greatest you can be.
[02:03:40.929 --> 02:03:52.214]  Now, I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[02:03:52.834 --> 02:03:54.014]  This is ghetto.
[02:03:54.435 --> 02:03:55.195]  This is ghetto.
[02:03:55.235 --> 02:03:56.355]  This is corporate.
[02:03:56.395 --> 02:03:58.716]  They're taking your energy.
[02:03:59.196 --> 02:04:01.477]  They're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return.
[02:04:01.877 --> 02:04:02.238]  Nothing!
[02:04:02.258 --> 02:04:03.478]  They're dumbing the language down.
[02:04:03.718 --> 02:04:05.639]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language.
[02:04:05.859 --> 02:04:06.919]  Directly out of 1984, it's Ingsoc.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:11.862]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:04:11.902 --> 02:04:13.263]  He said, Matt, it's over for you.
[02:04:13.623 --> 02:04:15.824]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:04:16.084 --> 02:04:16.665]  You're out of there.
[02:04:16.865 --> 02:04:19.186]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[02:04:19.506 --> 02:04:26.330]  To have a Supreme Court justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[02:04:26.690 --> 02:04:28.011]  Time is not forever.
[02:04:28.331 --> 02:04:31.433]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[02:04:32.253 --> 02:04:33.253]  Uh, rise and fall.
[02:04:33.493 --> 02:04:34.454]  There's not that many.
[02:04:34.574 --> 02:04:36.074]  It's a small amount.
[02:04:36.574 --> 02:04:42.135]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[02:04:42.235 --> 02:04:42.475]  No.
[02:04:42.695 --> 02:04:43.515]  No, you can't.
[02:04:43.635 --> 02:04:45.556]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[02:04:45.716 --> 02:04:50.657]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[02:04:50.917 --> 02:04:52.917]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[02:04:53.258 --> 02:04:55.698]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[02:04:55.978 --> 02:04:56.778]  This is insane.
[02:04:56.838 --> 02:05:00.019]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[02:05:00.399 --> 02:05:02.620]  Now, remember just recently... They're getting him lined up with it!
[02:05:02.881 --> 02:05:05.342]  So, they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[02:05:05.362 --> 02:05:07.003]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[02:05:07.384 --> 02:05:09.185]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[02:05:09.245 --> 02:05:19.992]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[02:05:22.677 --> 02:05:24.801]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:05:25.342 --> 02:05:30.532]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:05:31.983 --> 02:05:37.004]  And what's crazy is, Drudge was here a year and a few months ago, only interviews done in four years.
[02:05:37.804 --> 02:05:43.006]  It's all come true, but Trump killed TPP, but they're going ahead with all the censorship like Trump never got elected.
[02:05:43.486 --> 02:05:45.446]  That's what's crazy, is they're just ignoring it.
[02:05:45.846 --> 02:05:56.509]  I've really been pontificating, and I'm rude and I apologize, and I want to get some of the folks that have been waiting here, like Millie Weaver, to come in and comment and take phone calls from listeners until we go to midnight tonight.
[02:05:57.816 --> 02:06:02.460]  Because hey, I've decided not to just roll over to them banning us with Google Ads and trying to shut us down.
[02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:03.361]  They're doing it to Breitbart.
[02:06:03.962 --> 02:06:05.663]  They admit Breitbart can collapse.
[02:06:06.464 --> 02:06:07.345]  Support them too.
[02:06:09.126 --> 02:06:14.231]  I got calls about other big platforms, I'm not allowed to say their names yet, that AdRoll banned today.
[02:06:15.632 --> 02:06:15.832]  See?
[02:06:16.673 --> 02:06:18.394]  It's like, you just don't have access to Google.
[02:06:18.715 --> 02:06:19.696]  Talk about antitrust.
[02:06:20.831 --> 02:06:23.953]  When Google runs this big monopoly, you know, Trump needs to go after him.
[02:06:23.993 --> 02:06:28.076]  They're almost baiting him with a kill Trump and all this crap.
[02:06:28.696 --> 02:06:29.757]  They're really pushing it.
[02:06:29.777 --> 02:06:30.357]  But you know what?
[02:06:30.437 --> 02:06:34.540]  It's just a bunch of guys that are in corporations that are used to everybody doing what they say.
[02:06:35.652 --> 02:06:38.375]  And they really think they're gonna win, just like they thought Hillary would win.
[02:06:39.035 --> 02:06:40.337]  They had all the shows queued up.
[02:06:40.917 --> 02:06:42.358]  Let's play that Homeland clip in a moment.
[02:06:42.659 --> 02:06:43.459]  You know, the newest show.
[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:45.361]  Where, again, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.682 --> 02:06:47.443]  They admit it's Alex Jones at a press release.
[02:06:47.824 --> 02:06:50.006]  But then Raw story and others say, Jones is crazy.
[02:06:50.206 --> 02:06:51.607]  There's not TV shows about him.
[02:06:51.867 --> 02:06:54.110]  He's just all over the news being demonized as giant.
[02:06:54.530 --> 02:06:56.191]  Then they play that game where they attack you.
[02:06:57.495 --> 02:07:01.656]  Obamacare has tax penalties in it and they say no it doesn't.
[02:07:01.676 --> 02:07:05.797]  They play this game of messing with us because they're in charge.
[02:07:05.837 --> 02:07:06.877]  What would you call that Buckley?
[02:07:09.537 --> 02:07:09.918]  I don't know.
[02:07:10.018 --> 02:07:19.379]  It's like teasing you or like projection or maybe it's it's like that's like that's a good question because they basically tell you tell you something is an absolute lie.
[02:07:19.419 --> 02:07:20.400]  I think they're basically
[02:07:22.096 --> 02:07:29.362]  They're basically banking on the idiocy of the American public and their inability to actually go and look something up and actually investigate.
[02:07:29.382 --> 02:07:33.305]  Sure, or they know they've lied so much, they want to normalize it and just flood things with lies.
[02:07:33.486 --> 02:07:36.288]  Or it might be the Goebbels saying, the bigger the lie, the more they'll believe it.
[02:07:36.448 --> 02:07:44.915]  No, no, I agree with that, but I'm saying, they've been caught, so now they want to inoculate us, just 2 plus 2 doesn't equal 4, and by the way, Obamacare's free, so what if I lie?
[02:07:45.255 --> 02:07:45.716]  Exactly.
[02:07:47.293 --> 02:07:50.295]  The Republican Party's defending him, so you're the average globalist like Paul Ryan.
[02:07:50.595 --> 02:07:54.618]  You're in a meeting with Republican leaders, Democrat leaders, and billionaires, and they're like, oh, don't worry, we'll screw him.
[02:07:54.959 --> 02:07:56.560]  Hey, you like that big vacation home?
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:58.001]  Yeah, I'll get you another home.
[02:07:58.581 --> 02:07:59.682]  I'll just screw the public.
[02:07:59.702 --> 02:08:02.724]  That's why I think this fake news trope is going to blow up on him.
[02:08:02.784 --> 02:08:04.946]  It's already, you know, hitting Streisand levels.
[02:08:05.006 --> 02:08:14.313]  It's already turned into... Explain the Streisand effect, because they say, don't go to Infowars, don't go to Drudge, don't go to Breitbart, and then our levels go way up, even though they're putting
[02:08:14.793 --> 02:08:19.577]  Remember two years ago, Alexa, that's owned by Jeff Bezos, the CIA, funds him 600 million a year.
[02:08:19.597 --> 02:08:21.438]  The Washington Post has all come out, it's all CIA run.
[02:08:21.738 --> 02:08:23.780]  Criminal elements of the CIA shit, not the whole CIA.
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:25.861]  I'm trying to kiss the CIA's ass, just a fact.
[02:08:26.782 --> 02:08:28.703]  And there's rogue, you know, rogue elements of the majority.
[02:08:30.065 --> 02:08:34.228]  And, you know, they just come out and say, yeah, we're just going to ban whatever we call is fake.
[02:08:34.248 --> 02:08:35.789]  We're just not going to let you have access to the public.
[02:08:36.698 --> 02:08:36.998]  It's there.
[02:08:37.719 --> 02:08:37.919]  Right.
[02:08:38.019 --> 02:08:38.439]  Exactly.
[02:08:38.459 --> 02:08:45.024]  But it's like, you know, I always think about this one back in the day when they were saying, you know, drugs are so bad if you smoke weed, it'll make you go insane.
[02:08:45.064 --> 02:08:53.871]  And then some kid, you know, has one puff of a marijuana cigarette and all of a sudden all the drug indoctrination that they gave him has just evaporated because they're like,
[02:08:53.971 --> 02:08:55.092]  This doesn't make me crazy.
[02:08:55.152 --> 02:08:55.693]  It sucks.
[02:08:55.853 --> 02:08:56.314]  Exactly.
[02:08:56.354 --> 02:09:01.759]  So that's sort of what they're doing to us and people like us is they're demonizing us and it makes people curious.
[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.901]  People go and they listen to it.
[02:09:02.921 --> 02:09:03.381]  No, I agree.
[02:09:03.401 --> 02:09:06.785]  And they see what we're saying and they go, wait a minute, this is actually true.
[02:09:07.005 --> 02:09:10.949]  And then it shatters their whole reality, the whole paradigm that they're trying to build in the first place.
[02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:12.511]  So I think it's sort of going to backfire.
[02:09:12.531 --> 02:09:12.832]  I agree.
[02:09:12.852 --> 02:09:14.293]  I didn't tell the whole Bezos story.
[02:09:14.333 --> 02:09:15.795]  He's all CIA funded.
[02:09:16.235 --> 02:09:22.198]  The point is, he's involved in all this censorship and all this control and all this manipulation and trying to shut us up.
[02:09:22.258 --> 02:09:23.319]  It's just a total jerk.
[02:09:23.379 --> 02:09:25.560]  I mean, it's like, dude, you're worth like $15 billion.
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:27.641]  You own one of the biggest corporations in the world.
[02:09:27.681 --> 02:09:28.602]  Just leave us alone.
[02:09:28.622 --> 02:09:32.564]  Stop trying to take our guns and make us, you know, do all this crap.
[02:09:32.584 --> 02:09:34.125]  They're just into this dominance.
[02:09:34.405 --> 02:09:35.566]  Yeah, it's pretty freaky.
[02:09:35.606 --> 02:09:36.486]  You want to get to some questions?
[02:09:36.766 --> 02:09:37.547]  Let's run through a bunch.
[02:09:37.567 --> 02:09:38.227]  All right, here we go.
[02:09:38.627 --> 02:09:44.831]  Fapincarnate from Sweden says, Alex, do you think Sweden has a chance to make it now with Trump's comments about us leading
[02:09:45.411 --> 02:09:50.416]  To so many people who had previously been aware of the refugee crisis finally knowing what's been going on.
[02:09:51.136 --> 02:09:57.642]  I know for a fact that Trump sometimes trolls the media, other times he's just so honest about stuff.
[02:09:57.982 --> 02:10:05.269]  So like a general person, he'll just like, hey, last night in Sweden, what was three days before they had riots and rapes, and then the night after they had riots and rapes.
[02:10:05.289 --> 02:10:08.511]  So they go, oh, nothing happened last night and legal, you know, legal talk.
[02:10:08.892 --> 02:10:09.692]  He wasn't even
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:25.032]  You know, that wasn't advised, that wasn't a plan, he just did it, and that was what was so beautiful, because Sweden has the highest rapes in Europe, riots almost every night, the night he said they didn't have it, but he meant like he saw it two nights before.
[02:10:25.513 --> 02:10:32.759]  So it just shows they're piling on, and yeah, you've got the Netherlands, you've got Sweden, you've got Germany, you've got France, with nationalist movements.
[02:10:32.859 --> 02:10:36.863]  And by the way, they're not anti-anybody.
[02:10:37.679 --> 02:10:38.520]  They don't care.
[02:10:39.141 --> 02:10:41.845]  In fact, they're so white they've got a fetish for anything that isn't white.
[02:10:42.385 --> 02:10:46.370]  But, so they bring everybody in going, yeah, Muslims, everybody come in and they rape and kill them.
[02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:47.872]  Well, you don't want to get...
[02:10:48.777 --> 02:10:56.500]  Northern Europeans and Western Europeans on a bad kilt, because then we're going to get something even worse, which I think the globalists might actually be trying to stir up.
[02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:57.720]  I mean, this is sophisticated.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:04.162]  You know, just because they're pitching all this anti-white racism, let's realize they've exploited the third world, they've manipulated people.
[02:11:04.603 --> 02:11:07.544]  Let's stand up against the sickening thugs and folks, but let's not.
[02:11:07.564 --> 02:11:09.184]  And I don't say this to be politically correct.
[02:11:09.324 --> 02:11:10.365]  I want to beat the globalists.
[02:11:11.565 --> 02:11:14.907]  But then I thought they were pitching all this just to make whites racist a few years ago.
[02:11:14.927 --> 02:11:15.607]  Then I realized, no.
[02:11:16.308 --> 02:11:22.031]  They realize the demographics that like six billion people are outside Western Europe and the United States and they can make them political.
[02:11:22.071 --> 02:11:23.072]  They're just people like anybody.
[02:11:23.092 --> 02:11:33.338]  They can make brown people just as racist as white people and they're gonna flood everything and blow up the engine of productivity and just gang rape everybody and do all this crazy-ass stuff.
[02:11:33.378 --> 02:11:36.780]  So, you know, it's like we said today on the show.
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:38.240]  It's more like a satanic ritual.
[02:11:38.301 --> 02:11:38.701]  It's just
[02:11:39.932 --> 02:11:44.742]  You know, the communists and the socialists and the big banks, they just want to piss all over everything.
[02:11:45.734 --> 02:11:47.375]  Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[02:11:47.795 --> 02:11:50.157]  It's funny, everybody loves your ripping off the mandibles.
[02:11:50.237 --> 02:11:52.158]  I think that's probably going to turn into a new meme.
[02:11:52.198 --> 02:11:53.359]  What ripping off what mandibles?
[02:11:53.499 --> 02:11:55.100]  Ripping off the globalist mandibles.
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:12:04.427]  Yeah, it's like the centipede is incredible and targeted and once it turbo charges it rips off the mandibles and the pedophiles and other disgusting demons.
[02:12:05.127 --> 02:12:10.150]  Once the mandibles have been ingested the centipede uses the energy to lay eggs of liberty.
[02:12:10.731 --> 02:12:15.354]  Once those erupt through evolution they are now ready to devour the globalists.
[02:12:15.954 --> 02:12:18.196]  Now the greatest fear of the parasites is upon them.
[02:12:18.576 --> 02:12:19.536]  A liberty swarm.
[02:12:19.556 --> 02:12:21.478]  I love it.
[02:12:21.778 --> 02:12:24.319]  That's probably going to be a new... No, you should do that for... I want videos.
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:26.040]  Of course, I'm up here late at night.
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:27.941]  I want... I want all of it.
[02:12:28.482 --> 02:12:28.922]  Exactly.
[02:12:28.982 --> 02:12:32.024]  Feel free to make any memes or weird videos of Alex Jones.
[02:12:32.044 --> 02:12:32.424]  He loves them.
[02:12:32.444 --> 02:12:34.766]  Oh yeah, folks are always asking, can we make a meme?
[02:12:34.806 --> 02:12:35.206]  You better.
[02:12:35.226 --> 02:12:36.427]  Make fun of me.
[02:12:36.467 --> 02:12:36.927]  I don't care.
[02:12:37.687 --> 02:12:44.431]  So, Raritat in New Jersey says, Alex, how much time do you spend preparing on average for your daily four-hour show slash transmission?
[02:12:44.811 --> 02:12:47.232]  Who assists you and who prepares you some of the materials for the show?
[02:12:47.292 --> 02:12:52.855]  And finally, how do you manage to speak non-stop for hours, speak so eloquently with so much structure and thought?
[02:12:52.875 --> 02:12:54.116]  I don't know about that.
[02:12:54.136 --> 02:12:55.277]  They must be listening to somebody else.
[02:12:56.057 --> 02:13:00.661]  Uh, you know, I get ready a few hours at night, sometimes an hour in the morning, and come in for like 30 minutes, look at a bunch of stories.
[02:13:01.001 --> 02:13:07.887]  Most times, I'll just look at it like, Detroit Free Press is endorsing banning whiteboards, because someone might say something racist.
[02:13:08.127 --> 02:13:11.129]  This is level two, next dimension book banning.
[02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:12.811]  And then I'm just too freaked out to go on air.
[02:13:13.331 --> 02:13:16.434]  I mean, what happens is, my best shows, I don't look at the news.
[02:13:16.454 --> 02:13:17.634]  This only happens like every few months.
[02:13:18.175 --> 02:13:20.557]  And I'll come in, there's like 200 articles, 300 articles.
[02:13:20.577 --> 02:13:22.638]  I've already looked at most of them, I've already seen videos.
[02:13:23.419 --> 02:13:24.220]  I'm just going to forget it.
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:24.940]  I'm going to cover this.
[02:13:25.521 --> 02:13:33.968]  And then the show, because it's like, you know, it's good to ban writing in books because that caused problems to begin with.
[02:13:33.988 --> 02:13:41.574]  And you're like, you know, cuckoo, cuckoo, and you're like, it hits a level like, we're really this bad?
[02:13:42.895 --> 02:13:43.476]  It's pretty weird.
[02:13:44.576 --> 02:13:47.419]  It's crazy how throughout history they keep bringing up that Fahrenheit.
[02:13:48.109 --> 02:13:48.669]  You know, Eleven.
[02:13:48.689 --> 02:13:50.190]  I can't remember what that movie is about the break-up.
[02:14:18.729 --> 02:14:21.230]  You're not, like, hating the poor black people at that college in Detroit.
[02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:31.353]  You realize they are being mind-controlled, and it's always, like, weird, power-tripping white psychologists who realize they're following... They'll laugh and go, of course we're jacking their minds!
[02:14:31.573 --> 02:14:33.214]  You don't want blacks to rule anything!
[02:14:33.394 --> 02:14:34.154]  HALT HITLER!
[02:14:34.574 --> 02:14:35.355]  You're like, what?
[02:14:35.535 --> 02:14:38.358]  When you see enough liberals say, Heil Hitler, you're like, what the hell?
[02:14:38.678 --> 02:14:41.561]  Then you run into black people saying, let's kill all the blacks, Heil Hitler.
[02:14:41.942 --> 02:14:44.104]  Then you know you're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:14:44.124 --> 02:14:44.805]  Absolutely.
[02:14:44.825 --> 02:14:46.346]  Let me tell you, they got a lot of these black people.
[02:14:46.426 --> 02:14:51.792]  I used to be involved in demonstrating about abortion just to say, hey, no, this is happening.
[02:14:52.152 --> 02:14:52.953]  I've had blacks walk.
[02:14:52.973 --> 02:14:53.574]  I've got it on video.
[02:14:53.634 --> 02:14:54.575]  I've had black leaders on there.
[02:14:55.035 --> 02:14:56.776]  Oh, you white son of a bitch.
[02:14:57.337 --> 02:14:58.998]  Nobody wants these ugly black people.
[02:14:59.018 --> 02:15:00.139]  We need to get rid of them.
[02:15:00.159 --> 02:15:04.262]  Like, actually, there's more whites trying to adopt kids, period, than there are actually aborted.
[02:15:04.702 --> 02:15:08.886]  And I know a lot of whites want to adopt black kids, and they're like, you're gonna get them, Cracker.
[02:15:09.226 --> 02:15:09.966]  We're gonna kill them.
[02:15:10.807 --> 02:15:14.950]  And it's like some Satan ritual, and you're like, you can't even figure out, you're like, did that just get said?
[02:15:15.371 --> 02:15:17.032]  But the tenth time you're told that,
[02:15:19.488 --> 02:15:20.449]  And I'm not against masons.
[02:15:20.929 --> 02:15:22.230]  A lot of good masons found in the country.
[02:15:22.250 --> 02:15:23.391]  That's just some group they can take over.
[02:15:23.671 --> 02:15:25.512]  But it's always like some weird black mason.
[02:15:26.032 --> 02:15:26.673]  Prince Hall.
[02:15:27.033 --> 02:15:30.295]  Just when you're dealing with that, it's like that's who runs the black community.
[02:15:31.036 --> 02:15:32.957]  And they just show up and they go, we own these people.
[02:15:32.997 --> 02:15:34.178]  You get your ass out of here.
[02:15:34.198 --> 02:15:38.941]  It's like the devil, you know, over like Moses's body.
[02:15:39.762 --> 02:15:40.942]  Michael has to come get the body.
[02:15:40.962 --> 02:15:41.623]  That's how I describe it.
[02:15:41.643 --> 02:15:42.744]  Like these black people are powerful.
[02:15:42.784 --> 02:15:43.184]  They're good.
[02:15:43.204 --> 02:15:43.704]  They're strong.
[02:15:43.964 --> 02:15:45.826]  They've got all these gifts that humanity needs.
[02:15:46.126 --> 02:15:49.148]  Humanity's got all these groups of people with different talents and different gifts.
[02:15:49.828 --> 02:15:54.413]  There might be some whites that have gifts that black people have, some blacks that have gifts that whites have, but on average there's certain gifts.
[02:15:55.054 --> 02:16:01.742]  And like the devil is just hunched over, just like, this is mine, I'm gonna run this in the ground, and I'm gonna kill these people.
[02:16:02.659 --> 02:16:04.881]  That's because black people, as everybody are, are key.
[02:16:04.901 --> 02:16:08.283]  I'm not going to say African-American to play your word games or have to submit your words.
[02:16:08.663 --> 02:16:09.624]  They're key to the whole thing.
[02:16:09.684 --> 02:16:10.585]  Everybody's key to the whole deal.
[02:16:11.125 --> 02:16:14.067]  But it's just, they're like, this is mine, this is mine.
[02:16:14.768 --> 02:16:16.889]  And it's really satanic.
[02:16:16.929 --> 02:16:17.590]  Go ahead, next question.
[02:16:17.690 --> 02:16:18.330]  That's pretty freaky.
[02:16:19.351 --> 02:16:21.332]  Rabid Mylosexual says,
[02:16:22.173 --> 02:16:25.557]  How soon do you think Sessions is going to drop the hammer on some high-level pizza lovers?
[02:16:25.597 --> 02:16:30.162]  With them scalping Flynn and nearly scalping Milo and coming for your funding, they're turning up the heat.
[02:16:30.403 --> 02:16:30.923]  Hold on.
[02:16:30.963 --> 02:16:36.610]  In America, we can't say pizza or we're banned off Reddit and Dig and Facebook and Twitter.
[02:16:37.130 --> 02:16:38.592]  I don't think there's any pedophilia.
[02:16:38.592 --> 02:16:39.133]  I agree with the Pope.
[02:16:39.153 --> 02:16:39.713]  Banned free press?
[02:16:39.754 --> 02:16:44.240]  How dare anyone call in and talk about Pizzagate or Sandusky Sun or 1500 pedophiles arrested since Trump got in?
[02:16:56.823 --> 02:16:58.124]  You know, I agree with the U.N.
[02:16:58.184 --> 02:17:01.087]  I mean, they'll take me out of context so I shouldn't make the joke, but the U.N.
[02:17:01.127 --> 02:17:10.937]  pushes, I disagree with them, nambla, you know, let them grab kids out of your backyard, some pot-bellied 50-year-old guy shows up, he wants your daughter or son, you just give them to him when they're 10 years old, or 5 years old.
[02:17:12.079 --> 02:17:12.819]  I disagree with that.
[02:17:12.979 --> 02:17:17.124]  And then you get Milo, a rape victim of a Catholic priest, saying, you know, he's gotta be got rid of.
[02:17:18.085 --> 02:17:20.107]  Not the priest that raped him, but just, you know, that.
[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:22.101]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:17:22.481 --> 02:17:22.781]  I agree.
[02:17:23.442 --> 02:17:26.524]  Doomperial from Russia says, Mr. Jones, I have two questions.
[02:17:27.024 --> 02:17:30.207]  Where do you see this movement in the next decade with President Trump at the helm?
[02:17:30.707 --> 02:17:35.931]  And will America ever return to its constitutional past with an ultra-conservative Generation Z?
[02:17:36.471 --> 02:17:38.173]  Also, keep up the great work and the memes.
[02:17:39.847 --> 02:17:45.411]  Trump is like a surfer in Hawaii coming in on those big waves.
[02:17:45.952 --> 02:17:49.234]  If he surfs those waves, if he knows those waves, he'll win.
[02:17:50.035 --> 02:17:55.579]  If he deviates from those waves and gets out of that zeitgeist he's in, he'll be destroyed like any of us will.
[02:17:57.301 --> 02:17:58.201]  So Trump's a good guy.
[02:17:58.261 --> 02:17:58.982]  He means well.
[02:17:59.302 --> 02:18:00.423]  This is history happening.
[02:18:00.883 --> 02:18:01.504]  We're looking at it.
[02:18:01.824 --> 02:18:06.568]  All the metrics show he's trying to give wealth back to the public, empower humanity, make the planet about humans.
[02:18:07.496 --> 02:18:10.390]  But the rest of the question was, you know, what was the question?
[02:18:12.850 --> 02:18:15.712]  Basically, he says, where do you see this movement in the next decade?
[02:18:15.753 --> 02:18:17.874]  Well, yeah, we say with Trump, exactly.
[02:18:17.894 --> 02:18:28.704]  You know, with Wilders in the Netherlands, with Le Pen in France, with leaders in all over the world, places like South America and Brazil.
[02:18:29.665 --> 02:18:34.909]  Yeah, I know it's happening with the liberty movement in the UK, in the Netherlands, everywhere, in Italy.
[02:18:34.990 --> 02:18:38.613]  I mean, not just the Netherlands, it's happening in Iceland, Reykjavik.
[02:18:39.892 --> 02:18:49.844]  So it's really up to us where this movement goes of, hey, there's a bunch of megabanks running things that are flooding us with third world populations, telling us we're evil because of what color we are and we should accept world government.
[02:18:50.165 --> 02:18:59.075]  This is just corporations conquering people and flooding stable political systems with instability because they already rule instability around the world.
[02:18:59.676 --> 02:19:01.158]  So they're just bringing in a control system.
[02:19:01.198 --> 02:19:12.189]  So I think the choice, whether we're going to have a stable, upwardly mobile, pro-human movement beginning, or this globalist, hellish, anti-human model, I think those decisions are being made right now.
[02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:14.131]  So I think it's up to you to answer the question.
[02:19:15.219 --> 02:19:15.599]  Good answer.
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:31.207]  Wearaloco420 says that he's a longtime listener and he says that yesterday on your show Mike Cernovich emphasized the primacy of us meeting up with like-minded people to organize and support Trump and his agenda and create an optical counterpoint to the howling mobs of paid leftist provocateurs.
[02:19:31.267 --> 02:19:32.487]  We should hire this guy as a writer.
[02:19:33.388 --> 02:19:34.308]  My question is this.
[02:19:34.328 --> 02:19:39.030]  We need to create an alternate optical, an alternate optical of the howling mobs and anti-Trumpers.
[02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:40.991]  That's it.
[02:19:41.391 --> 02:19:41.892]  You'll do it.
[02:19:42.332 --> 02:19:43.172]  Have a hidden camera.
[02:19:43.212 --> 02:19:44.173]  Go to a city council meeting.
[02:19:44.913 --> 02:19:45.514]  Follow the mayor.
[02:19:45.554 --> 02:19:46.094]  Go to a bar.
[02:19:46.154 --> 02:19:46.755]  See what he does.
[02:19:47.436 --> 02:19:47.976]  It's all legal.
[02:19:48.016 --> 02:19:48.517]  It's America.
[02:19:48.537 --> 02:19:51.160]  Follow me and you're not going to see anything.
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:51.880]  They've already done it.
[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:52.321]  Don't worry.
[02:19:52.341 --> 02:19:52.761]  Plenty of times.
[02:19:52.781 --> 02:19:54.343]  They're like, does this guy do anything wrong?
[02:19:54.363 --> 02:19:56.105]  I used to speed in my car.
[02:19:56.165 --> 02:19:56.525]  That's it.
[02:19:59.554 --> 02:20:00.294]  Just go out.
[02:20:00.394 --> 02:20:01.014]  Be involved.
[02:20:01.074 --> 02:20:02.295]  Go out and confront the bullies.
[02:20:02.335 --> 02:20:03.855]  Not in a hateful way, but like, what the hell?
[02:20:03.875 --> 02:20:04.395]  Who pays you?
[02:20:04.415 --> 02:20:05.035]  Why do you brainwash?
[02:20:05.915 --> 02:20:07.055]  Don't let them intimidate.
[02:20:07.095 --> 02:20:08.656]  Don't let them bully these Congress people.
[02:20:08.956 --> 02:20:10.536]  The Congress people already want to be bullied.
[02:20:10.556 --> 02:20:15.877]  It's all part of an object that they've been bullied, and there's this movement against Trump, and all Fox News is pushing that.
[02:20:16.477 --> 02:20:17.357]  Start your own blog.
[02:20:17.377 --> 02:20:18.238]  Start your own website.
[02:20:18.258 --> 02:20:19.098]  Start your own videos.
[02:20:19.158 --> 02:20:20.018]  Start speaking out.
[02:20:20.598 --> 02:20:23.299]  You know, you'll be the next YouTube star, but who cares about being a star?
[02:20:23.339 --> 02:20:24.679]  It's about empowering humanity.
[02:20:25.799 --> 02:20:31.484]  And don't get involved in infighting with people bitching at you for your orthodoxy that you didn't follow something the way they said.
[02:20:31.904 --> 02:20:32.645]  You love God.
[02:20:32.745 --> 02:20:33.525]  You love justice.
[02:20:33.565 --> 02:20:34.266]  You love freedom.
[02:20:34.666 --> 02:20:35.427]  Speak that truth.
[02:20:36.248 --> 02:20:36.508]  Awesome.
[02:20:36.988 --> 02:20:44.214]  Keckrad from Ohio says, Dear Alex Jones, as someone who is a student at a university, how can we stand up to the globalists and lunatic liberals?
[02:20:44.614 --> 02:20:50.359]  I still don't understand how our school can have a terrorist attack and defend the attacker by saying he's a victim of police brutality.
[02:20:50.379 --> 02:20:53.362]  That was stabbing people and running over them and the cops shot him and the cops are bad.
[02:20:53.382 --> 02:20:56.624]  Not that the cops are perfect, but they're shooting a guy that just stabbed nine people.
[02:20:57.165 --> 02:20:59.106]  Buy the guy a piece of pie, you know what I mean?
[02:20:59.327 --> 02:21:01.689]  This is just a cop just like us, you know?
[02:21:01.709 --> 02:21:03.570]  If a cop's a bad guy, I'll call him out.
[02:21:04.151 --> 02:21:09.916]  But statistically, it's... I used to even buy into this PSYOP until I looked at the statistics and I realized it.
[02:21:11.345 --> 02:21:17.608]  Just like concealed carry holders are the lowest crime rate and the best people, the average person that goes to be a cop must be a masochist.
[02:21:17.848 --> 02:21:20.169]  I mean, this is a tough job.
[02:21:20.509 --> 02:21:22.450]  I'm sure they write tickets and do all that.
[02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:24.091]  You're pissed off they pulled you over.
[02:21:24.951 --> 02:21:26.732]  You're driving in the wrong lane at 100 miles an hour.
[02:21:26.752 --> 02:21:28.013]  I mean, God forbid the cop do that.
[02:21:28.393 --> 02:21:33.515]  The point is you finally stop being an arrogant asshole and realize we have basic laws for humanity.
[02:21:33.916 --> 02:21:35.456]  The globalists don't have laws on them, though.
[02:21:37.637 --> 02:21:51.201]  When they project, and I realized this about seven, eight years ago, I had this epiphany, I had a dream, I woke up at like, ask me anything, I'll tell you, the guy was saying, about 2 a.m., and I have a few of these waking dreams in my life, but they're always sentient, they're always prophetic, they're always real.
[02:21:51.741 --> 02:21:58.903]  And I woke up pouring sweat, and I was totally guilty for bashing TSA workers and police.
[02:21:59.643 --> 02:22:05.725]  And I had sweat pouring off me, I didn't have a fever, and I went in, I drank some water in the middle of the night, the kids were asleep, went in, looked at the family,
[02:22:07.085 --> 02:22:07.546]  It all hit me.
[02:22:07.566 --> 02:22:09.707]  It was like, the Congress did this.
[02:22:09.767 --> 02:22:11.067]  The Congress left the borders open.
[02:22:11.107 --> 02:22:12.248]  They brought in the Islamists.
[02:22:12.688 --> 02:22:15.029]  These are just people wanting jobs, mainly veterans doing this.
[02:22:15.049 --> 02:22:16.310]  They're not pedophiles on average.
[02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:21.932]  The media makes the TSA the enemy because they want you to focus on low-level government as the enemy and not those on top.
[02:22:22.233 --> 02:22:25.114]  If you want to reform it, don't focus on the police, the TSA.
[02:22:25.174 --> 02:22:27.195]  Focus on the fact that we let this happen.
[02:22:27.675 --> 02:22:29.056]  You know, this is your greatest failure.
[02:22:29.796 --> 02:22:32.717]  And wherever that came from, I understood that.
[02:22:32.737 --> 02:22:36.038]  It doesn't mean we don't go after a bad cop or bad system protecting them.
[02:22:36.158 --> 02:22:42.139]  It's that the globalists, the TPP, the New World Order, the big systems, that's what makes these decisions.
[02:22:42.459 --> 02:22:53.342]  And as soon as we stop fighting with each other, like black and white, or citizen and, you know, a fellow citizen cop, you actually support the police and then go to their meetings and then go and tell them they're wrong.
[02:22:53.362 --> 02:22:54.222]  They'll break down crying.
[02:22:56.479 --> 02:22:59.644]  You tell them, I want to kill you, then they hate you.
[02:23:00.325 --> 02:23:01.086]  It's humanity.
[02:23:01.206 --> 02:23:06.013]  Whether what color you are, whether you're a cop or citizen, you have to reach out with humanity and then nothing.
[02:23:06.213 --> 02:23:10.559]  Whether you're Hispanic, or black, or white, Asian, we're all humans.
[02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:12.562]  You reach out as a real person.
[02:23:13.519 --> 02:23:15.340]  And you actually do that, they can't stand it.
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:17.521]  They claim they want federal community policing.
[02:23:17.541 --> 02:23:18.441]  They made a bunch of spies.
[02:23:19.121 --> 02:23:19.922]  No, this is real.
[02:23:20.782 --> 02:23:23.743]  And, again, they want us to blame our local government.
[02:23:24.083 --> 02:23:25.584]  The average mayor doesn't know what's going on.
[02:23:25.604 --> 02:23:27.925]  They just follow what the big corporations say in the new zoning law.
[02:23:28.225 --> 02:23:30.566]  You go show them, you... Austin's an exception.
[02:23:30.626 --> 02:23:31.546]  It's run by the UN.
[02:23:31.826 --> 02:23:33.107]  The UN admits it's a model city.
[02:23:33.407 --> 02:23:34.167]  Completely controlled.
[02:23:34.227 --> 02:23:35.268]  It's run by really bad people.
[02:23:35.808 --> 02:23:36.849]  It's a model for us.
[02:23:37.450 --> 02:23:38.471]  It's like, I didn't mean to be here.
[02:23:38.531 --> 02:23:39.271]  My mom's from here.
[02:23:39.311 --> 02:23:40.733]  I went to high school here, part of high school.
[02:23:41.213 --> 02:23:43.976]  I didn't mean to be like in the UN model fortress city.
[02:23:44.776 --> 02:23:45.957]  But other cities aren't the same.
[02:23:45.977 --> 02:23:48.540]  This is the model so they see it and hear what was successful.
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:53.705]  So we're like in, you know, the mountain of doom here.
[02:23:53.745 --> 02:23:58.249]  We're in, you know, the, I don't know what you call it, but these are
[02:23:59.994 --> 02:24:01.135]  Well, let's go to some more calls.
[02:24:01.735 --> 02:24:05.998]  You ask these questions and they're so big, and they're so fundamental, and they're so strong.
[02:24:06.438 --> 02:24:08.399]  I want to take some phone calls in a minute and bring Millie in here.
[02:24:08.419 --> 02:24:09.139]  Go ahead.
[02:24:09.239 --> 02:24:09.820]  Is Millie still here?
[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:12.741]  If she wanted to leave with her man, that's fine.
[02:24:13.282 --> 02:24:14.322]  We'll bring her in about 10 minutes.
[02:24:14.623 --> 02:24:15.243]  Let's do a few more.
[02:24:15.523 --> 02:24:18.645]  Okay, so GokuIsTheGoat says, thank you for the AMA, Alex.
[02:24:18.805 --> 02:24:21.707]  Is the American government going after George Soros and his family yet?
[02:24:22.167 --> 02:24:25.389]  Is it being kept quiet to keep him and his family complacent?
[02:24:27.412 --> 02:24:33.515]  As evil as George Soros was, Renfield and Bram Stoker procures the children.
[02:24:34.436 --> 02:24:35.176]  He's an archetype.
[02:24:36.437 --> 02:24:41.239]  Just like they knew in another, you know, who wrote Frankenstein?
[02:24:41.259 --> 02:24:43.020]  150 years ago, you put a, who?
[02:24:44.201 --> 02:24:45.001]  Shelley, Mary Shelley.
[02:24:45.081 --> 02:24:45.581]  Mary Shelley.
[02:24:46.042 --> 02:24:48.723]  You put electricity into somebody, they come back to life.
[02:24:48.863 --> 02:24:49.563]  Now that works.
[02:24:50.304 --> 02:24:51.104]  They already knew all this.
[02:24:51.965 --> 02:24:54.506]  The Greeks had batteries 2,500 years ago.
[02:24:54.926 --> 02:24:56.327]  The elites already had all this stuff.
[02:24:57.483 --> 02:25:01.884]  It was just High Priest had control of it, and it was very limited and not deployed to everybody.
[02:25:02.304 --> 02:25:06.145]  The Renaissance decide to deploy all this.
[02:25:06.985 --> 02:25:07.705]  What was the question again?
[02:25:07.725 --> 02:25:08.245]  I'll go back to it.
[02:25:09.366 --> 02:25:13.306]  The question was, is the American government going after George Soros and his family?
[02:25:13.326 --> 02:25:14.387]  Okay, so let's understand.
[02:25:14.607 --> 02:25:24.349]  George Soros, when he was 12, 13, 14, 15, rounded up thousands of Jewish families because he knew how to go in the houses, figure out where they were hiding, get them.
[02:25:25.336 --> 02:25:26.337]  Tell them I'm here to help you.
[02:25:26.357 --> 02:25:27.178]  What do you own?
[02:25:27.579 --> 02:25:28.760]  And then take their money and kill them.
[02:25:29.721 --> 02:25:32.384]  So imagine, I mean, you're running up families and killing them at 13.
[02:25:32.484 --> 02:25:36.149]  I mean, you are tailor-made to run spider operations for Satan.
[02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:44.658]  But George Soros himself is just a front man for really satanic forces behind him.
[02:25:45.563 --> 02:25:47.204]  So people ask, when do Soros get it?
[02:25:47.705 --> 02:25:52.148]  There are people that control trillions of dollars that are really scared right now.
[02:25:52.208 --> 02:25:54.510]  They could plunge the economy, but then what happens to them?
[02:25:54.570 --> 02:25:56.772]  They could start a war, but then what happens to them?
[02:25:57.452 --> 02:25:59.153]  And then do they run to Tasmania?
[02:25:59.173 --> 02:26:00.234]  Do they run to Kauai?
[02:26:00.294 --> 02:26:00.915]  What do they do?
[02:26:00.935 --> 02:26:02.096]  Do they run to the Cook Islands?
[02:26:02.776 --> 02:26:06.099]  You know, their own security details they know are against them.
[02:26:06.939 --> 02:26:07.700]  Because they listen to me.
[02:26:09.261 --> 02:26:09.721]  You understand?
[02:26:10.442 --> 02:26:11.483]  I'm not saying it's a power trip.
[02:26:13.829 --> 02:26:17.310]  People that have done real stuff, they listen to me because they can listen.
[02:26:17.350 --> 02:26:18.371]  They know this isn't a game.
[02:26:19.131 --> 02:26:20.731]  This is like humanity's last gasp.
[02:26:21.212 --> 02:26:22.532]  Like a death rattle, a warning.
[02:26:22.552 --> 02:26:24.693]  Because God owes that to everybody.
[02:26:25.193 --> 02:26:27.714]  It's not... That's the office we're in.
[02:26:27.794 --> 02:26:28.854]  Not just me, but the whole crew.
[02:26:29.315 --> 02:26:32.456]  We're in the office of... God gives you a chance.
[02:26:33.076 --> 02:26:34.576]  And God gives these evil people a chance.
[02:26:34.616 --> 02:26:37.857]  Now, they don't take that chance as a way to get out of it.
[02:26:37.898 --> 02:26:39.898]  They take it as solid, cold intel.
[02:26:40.939 --> 02:26:41.319]  And so...
[02:26:42.691 --> 02:26:46.339]  Smart people like Trump, they have to metaphysically give them the rule.
[02:26:46.379 --> 02:26:49.004]  They go, you need to surrender now.
[02:26:49.024 --> 02:26:51.389]  You need to stop now.
[02:26:52.455 --> 02:26:53.155]  We're gonna do this.
[02:26:53.235 --> 02:26:54.076]  And they don't surrender.
[02:26:54.116 --> 02:26:55.016]  They go, we're doing this now.
[02:26:55.577 --> 02:26:56.377]  They're like, okay.
[02:26:56.517 --> 02:26:59.979]  And then it escalates and it escalates and it escalates.
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:06.003]  And the threat continuum, like a cop pulling somebody over who's drunk driving, the guy is belligerent.
[02:27:06.043 --> 02:27:06.903]  He just talks to him.
[02:27:06.943 --> 02:27:07.504]  He attacks him.
[02:27:07.544 --> 02:27:08.084]  He tasers him.
[02:27:08.304 --> 02:27:08.824]  He pulls a gun.
[02:27:08.844 --> 02:27:09.285]  He kills him.
[02:27:09.745 --> 02:27:12.747]  And so they're like already tasering us, but we're here.
[02:27:12.767 --> 02:27:14.047]  We're like, okay, you need to stop that.
[02:27:14.648 --> 02:27:21.732]  Because we understand that they've got kill switches in this whole temple of doom that are going to get really destructive.
[02:27:23.407 --> 02:27:28.790]  We have to metaphysically go through these steps just to basically point all this out.
[02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:32.212]  And so that's where we're at.
[02:27:32.272 --> 02:27:33.773]  It's why Soros hasn't been taken out.
[02:27:34.773 --> 02:27:38.435]  He has financial kill switches, other kill switches.
[02:27:39.055 --> 02:27:40.816]  He's got teams of people ready to move.
[02:27:41.076 --> 02:27:41.937]  Here's the deal.
[02:27:42.377 --> 02:27:44.478]  George Soros is alive because he's dead.
[02:27:46.379 --> 02:27:52.963]  George Soros, probably at 20 years old or so, completely turned himself over and is living dead.
[02:27:54.076 --> 02:27:54.916]  I thought about this the other day.
[02:27:54.936 --> 02:27:56.797]  George Soros is a zombie.
[02:27:57.577 --> 02:27:59.778]  So he's just a reanimated corpse.
[02:28:00.078 --> 02:28:00.898]  It doesn't matter.
[02:28:01.318 --> 02:28:04.799]  So people that know what's happening understand we can vaporize him.
[02:28:05.220 --> 02:28:06.500]  We haven't gotten at the enemy.
[02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:14.002]  We have to unlock the public's mind and have them accept God and his son Christ and the Holy Spirit and life.
[02:28:14.583 --> 02:28:17.443]  That relationship is going to break their spiritual spell.
[02:28:18.004 --> 02:28:18.684]  Knocking out
[02:28:20.091 --> 02:28:25.998]  A zombie that's stumbling around on spiritual wires is not going to free humanity.
[02:28:26.779 --> 02:28:27.159]  That's why.
[02:28:27.340 --> 02:28:28.661]  Soros is not alive.
[02:28:29.222 --> 02:28:30.463]  Soros does not exist.
[02:28:30.884 --> 02:28:34.188]  Soros is dead already, so he doesn't matter.
[02:28:34.548 --> 02:28:38.813]  He's only a symbol of the deep state.
[02:28:39.895 --> 02:28:41.676]  That serves the death cult that is Satan.
[02:28:42.276 --> 02:28:46.197]  Let's go to the next question.
[02:28:47.517 --> 02:28:56.860]  Quick swipe USA says, Alex, we know Trump's campaign promises and how well he's accomplishing them, but what do you predict Trump will do once he achieves them all?
[02:29:01.002 --> 02:29:05.443]  I think Trump will roll over and die.
[02:29:07.503 --> 02:29:08.564]  I mean, that's the big journey.
[02:29:08.604 --> 02:29:09.806]  That's the big mission completed.
[02:29:10.907 --> 02:29:11.528]  Enemy defeated.
[02:29:11.548 --> 02:29:23.361]  He'll roll over and let his kids have a name that he hopes they're worthy of into the future and the big golden march of humanity, which if you can see it, it's like, why would you follow that?
[02:29:23.381 --> 02:29:25.524]  That's a great opportunity.
[02:29:25.544 --> 02:29:26.745]  So he
[02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:35.455]  Trump, Trump's greatest sin is that he doesn't hate people and he wants the average person to succeed.
[02:29:35.495 --> 02:29:50.968]  He's very competitive and he sees how anti-human this whole system is and as a super alpha male he wants to take on these forces of oppression and his instincts are so pure
[02:29:52.603 --> 02:29:58.206]  That he resonates and they can't stand it with a crowd of people or with Steve Bannon or with me.
[02:29:58.686 --> 02:30:05.310]  That's why the enemy just constantly tries to keep him out of the sunlight and out of the people because that just energizes him.
[02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:08.172]  And then they've got this big explosive flamethrower to deal with.
[02:30:08.872 --> 02:30:11.374]  But Trump can't lose at this point.
[02:30:11.434 --> 02:30:19.901]  I mean, he's committed himself to life, committed himself to justice, and you can tell he's in a lot of pain spiritually.
[02:30:20.582 --> 02:30:22.404]  Before he was just more of an arrogant alpha male.
[02:30:22.444 --> 02:30:26.567]  Now that he's in that office and channeling humanity's will, it's very humbling.
[02:30:27.208 --> 02:30:31.831]  And so Trump is on his knees before God.
[02:30:32.887 --> 02:30:34.989]  And in that office, you can't do anything to Trump.
[02:30:35.409 --> 02:30:36.590]  You know, they killed his body.
[02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:47.257]  The fact that he invoked the sacrament, the fact that he invoked the will of God, the fact that he invoked the birthright, the fact that he brought life back in and said it's a planet of men and women.
[02:30:48.138 --> 02:31:03.971]  And the fact that he spoke those satanic words to the enemy, because they're satanic to them, it's evil, that men and women are together and we have prosperity and we build and the image of a beautiful woman and a man and a nest and prosperity and strength and beauty, it just, it hurts them.
[02:31:04.752 --> 02:31:13.059]  And so they can't, you know, the evil wants to cut the birthright off and Trump is a big shining example of the birthright.
[02:31:14.099 --> 02:31:15.701]  And so that's why Trump must fall.
[02:31:16.482 --> 02:31:18.944]  Because Trump doesn't feel good when poor people are poor.
[02:31:19.765 --> 02:31:27.774]  He'll run over somebody, if he buys something, they try to screw him over, and, oh, he's mean to an architect, but Trump will charge him, oh, he's so horrible, you know, it's all a load of crap.
[02:31:29.036 --> 02:31:33.078]  You know, what you know is when the whole world's being offered to him, he says, I don't want it.
[02:31:33.598 --> 02:31:35.639]  I want to empower people for all his crimes.
[02:31:36.139 --> 02:31:36.800]  None of us are perfect.
[02:31:36.820 --> 02:31:42.162]  We all have committed crimes against humanity, against ourselves, against our children, against our wives.
[02:31:42.522 --> 02:31:43.283]  None of us are perfect.
[02:31:43.303 --> 02:31:54.008]  But the point is, Trump loves God and loves humanity and loves prosperity and doesn't like sorrow and pestilence and betrayal and ugliness.
[02:31:54.108 --> 02:31:56.109]  And because he loves beauty,
[02:31:56.889 --> 02:32:00.653]  Which Satan masquerades as beauty, but Trump loves the true beauty God gives us.
[02:32:01.074 --> 02:32:03.617]  Because of that, he's above the devil.
[02:32:06.179 --> 02:32:06.740]  Wow, that's deep.
[02:32:07.441 --> 02:32:15.350]  Bingo Wings says, Mr. Jones, how do you think people can effectively smash through the fake stream news narrative to actually convey the truth to people?
[02:32:15.770 --> 02:32:17.772]  It seems these days that it's very hard to find.
[02:32:18.743 --> 02:32:29.207]  If you look at the boy-like narcissism of a Chris Hedges that I've heard a shot, or his zombie controllers, the Clintons, it's just all delusion in their mind.
[02:32:29.287 --> 02:32:30.567]  Like, again, you're three years old.
[02:32:30.587 --> 02:32:36.609]  I remember being three years old, playing Batman and Robin with Ryan Baxter, my next-door neighbor friend, best friends with my parents, Christa.
[02:32:39.890 --> 02:32:42.112]  I looked at him and I said, we're not Batman and Robin.
[02:32:42.132 --> 02:32:43.372]  He said, but it's fun to pretend we are.
[02:32:43.392 --> 02:32:45.794]  And I said, let's, let's be real people.
[02:32:45.954 --> 02:32:47.055]  And I wasn't putting him down.
[02:32:47.495 --> 02:32:51.778]  At three, I didn't want to pretend that I was playing fantasy football.
[02:32:51.818 --> 02:32:52.678]  I wanted to play football.
[02:32:52.939 --> 02:32:55.320]  Then I realized football didn't matter, so I wanted to move on to other things.
[02:32:56.141 --> 02:32:59.703]  You know, where other guys were talking about, I'm not bragging about the women they had, I had the women.
[02:33:00.103 --> 02:33:01.204]  I'm not bragging, it's just a fact.
[02:33:01.884 --> 02:33:05.827]  So, that's really the difference here, is that it's a facsimile.
[02:33:06.247 --> 02:33:07.188]  It's a simulation.
[02:33:08.109 --> 02:33:09.870]  And so, what was the question?
[02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:13.771]  The question was, Jones is taking all the break for us.
[02:33:15.232 --> 02:33:16.413]  Uh, no, hold on, I'll go back up.
[02:33:16.753 --> 02:33:20.014]  How do you think people can effectively smash through the fake news?
[02:33:20.334 --> 02:33:23.876]  It's when Chris Hedges looks at you like you're pathetic in a con game.
[02:33:24.596 --> 02:33:28.178]  Don't feel like, I'm a man, I'm better than him, I'll speak out and beat him.
[02:33:28.238 --> 02:33:32.039]  Realize that is what you don't want to be with Maxine Waters.
[02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:35.501]  Who thinks we're, you know, Russia is at war with Korea right now.
[02:33:36.368 --> 02:33:39.589]  I mean, don't feel powerful that you're better than these people.
[02:33:40.029 --> 02:33:43.770]  Thank God every millisecond that you're not Chris Hedges or Maxine Waters.
[02:33:44.530 --> 02:33:46.910]  And realize that in a mean way, they're all about how they're dominant.
[02:33:46.930 --> 02:33:48.311]  They're all about how they're better than you.
[02:33:49.251 --> 02:33:50.571]  Because they're nobodies.
[02:33:52.311 --> 02:33:54.572]  And then just go to a soup kitchen.
[02:33:54.612 --> 02:33:55.532]  Don't talk about it.
[02:33:55.572 --> 02:33:56.292]  Don't give money.
[02:33:56.692 --> 02:33:57.392]  And I've done both.
[02:33:57.913 --> 02:33:59.433]  Go to a soup kitchen.
[02:34:00.444 --> 02:34:03.825]  Go bring a dog that does tricks to an old folks home.
[02:34:04.385 --> 02:34:10.446]  Let me tell you something much better than going to a movie or going to some group where everybody kisses your ass at some thing where you get an award.
[02:34:10.466 --> 02:34:19.968]  I don't want to go to those things to make people feel good they're getting awards, but it's like go with a dog that does tricks and licks an old lady's hand whose kids ain't seen her in six months.
[02:34:20.568 --> 02:34:27.050]  You want to get close to God, your spirit, God will literally move on you when you're taking care of somebody.
[02:34:27.930 --> 02:34:30.911]  If you go out to an abortion clinic, if a woman wants to kill her kid, it's satanic.
[02:34:30.972 --> 02:34:31.532]  It's her thing.
[02:34:32.132 --> 02:34:33.533]  We're not attacking her for what she's done.
[02:34:33.793 --> 02:34:34.313]  She's blinded.
[02:34:34.713 --> 02:34:39.095]  You actually talk to a woman, care about her, let her know there's groups that'll pay for her to have the kid and adopt it.
[02:34:39.355 --> 02:34:40.176]  She won't even know that.
[02:34:40.216 --> 02:34:40.816]  Nobody told her.
[02:34:41.356 --> 02:34:42.257]  You'll have a friend for life.
[02:34:43.558 --> 02:34:47.721]  You know, it's just, it's having that humanity, caring about somebody.
[02:34:48.281 --> 02:34:53.185]  People think being completely self-centered and not having a heart is what makes them strong.
[02:34:53.245 --> 02:34:54.526]  No, they've died as people.
[02:34:55.086 --> 02:34:59.409]  Having a big bloody heart, a bleeding heart that the left claims they own.
[02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.290]  No.
[02:35:01.331 --> 02:35:01.531]  No.
[02:35:01.891 --> 02:35:03.572]  Those that love Christ have the bleeding heart.
[02:35:04.133 --> 02:35:06.474]  Because we feel what people are doing.
[02:35:06.735 --> 02:35:07.955]  We dial into their pain.
[02:35:07.996 --> 02:35:09.417]  We experience their pain.
[02:35:10.422 --> 02:35:13.684]  And that's our real strength, is that we're open to the universe.
[02:35:14.125 --> 02:35:18.548]  People think they limit their consciousness and dominate others, that they gain power out of that.
[02:35:18.608 --> 02:35:28.815]  You gain power which you don't even want the moment you dial in to Christ and all that's good and all that's waiting for us.
[02:35:28.916 --> 02:35:32.158]  And I say that because we have smashed the enemy.
[02:35:32.458 --> 02:35:34.460]  You know, we have done things that nobody's ever done.
[02:35:35.327 --> 02:35:36.968]  We have elected presidents.
[02:35:37.008 --> 02:35:38.229]  We have changed paradigms.
[02:35:38.249 --> 02:35:39.109]  But it's only the beginning.
[02:35:39.470 --> 02:35:40.250]  It's not about us.
[02:35:40.390 --> 02:35:42.552]  It's about a pure connection.
[02:35:43.692 --> 02:35:48.516]  And the devil comes to you in the spirit and says, you've done these bad things.
[02:35:49.096 --> 02:35:50.977]  You can't have communion with Christ.
[02:35:51.437 --> 02:35:53.038]  But Christ says no!
[02:35:54.281 --> 02:35:55.601]  The heart being right is what matters.
[02:35:55.962 --> 02:35:58.382]  The devil is the accuser and tells you you're evil.
[02:35:58.682 --> 02:36:00.143]  If you want to be good, it's all there.
[02:36:00.363 --> 02:36:10.886]  King David got caught up in wars and this woman he desired more than anything and he sent her husband off, his military general, to be killed in a suicide mission so he could have her.
[02:36:12.631 --> 02:36:27.561]  And he later stopped it and repented to God, and it was legitimate, and was in sorrow for weeks, and God knew it was legitimate, and he saw the whole error of his way, and then he became a man after God's own heart.
[02:36:28.321 --> 02:36:31.003]  God knows our failures.
[02:36:31.343 --> 02:36:32.704]  God knows what we've done.
[02:36:34.170 --> 02:36:35.971]  God isn't creating a bunch of wimps.
[02:36:36.752 --> 02:36:41.295]  God's creating people that are going to experience things and not be cowards.
[02:36:42.616 --> 02:36:44.357]  And that's the truth to everything.
[02:36:44.938 --> 02:36:46.939]  I would never kill somebody to have their woman.
[02:36:47.339 --> 02:36:49.421]  But I don't look at King David as an evil man.
[02:36:50.421 --> 02:36:56.245]  It was something he did and it's a pain we all have for his failure before God.
[02:36:57.306 --> 02:36:58.207]  But then he made it up.
[02:36:59.858 --> 02:37:00.678]  And that's where we stand.
[02:37:01.099 --> 02:37:06.261]  So never let the devil, for the sins you've committed, tell you that you don't have a place with Christ.
[02:37:06.861 --> 02:37:09.322]  Because that's the name they want banned.
[02:37:09.682 --> 02:37:11.183]  It's the spirit they want stopped.
[02:37:11.503 --> 02:37:13.004]  It's the idea they want killed.
[02:37:13.484 --> 02:37:14.925]  Not because you'll find it in the churches.
[02:37:14.965 --> 02:37:16.745]  Those are the dens of the literal devil.
[02:37:17.366 --> 02:37:26.790]  But because in the world, the archetype of God-made man through us, to experience our failures, is the true
[02:37:29.108 --> 02:37:32.952]  Avatar of everything we are and everything we'll ever be.
[02:37:32.972 --> 02:37:34.833]  Let's go to some more calls.
[02:37:34.913 --> 02:37:46.824]  I'm gonna go to tape, come back within an hour of phone calls, and Millie and whoever wants to come in, whoever wants to come in, come in, you guys can pop in, you can do whatever you want, but I'm just being real with people and explaining to people why the enemy hates us so much.
[02:37:46.844 --> 02:37:49.426]  It's very intense.
[02:37:49.927 --> 02:37:53.170]  Um, the, let me see, uh,
[02:37:54.656 --> 02:37:58.399]  The Jam Boys says, Mr. Jones, Trump supporter living in Germany.
[02:37:58.439 --> 02:38:00.200]  People call me crazy, but I'm not crazy.
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:04.283]  When do you think the EU will figure it out and start making the world great again with the Donald?
[02:38:04.563 --> 02:38:07.085]  Well, I mean, it'd be like if you were a black slave in 1830 in Alabama.
[02:38:09.099 --> 02:38:11.500]  And you went into town, because the slaves did all the work.
[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:15.941]  They drove the carriages, they did the work, they were... And you go into town, there's some crazy Christians.
[02:38:16.401 --> 02:38:19.642]  They're saying, this is evil to suppress our fellow humans, don't do it, blah, blah, blah.
[02:38:19.662 --> 02:38:22.102]  And you see them getting beat up in the street, or drug off to jail.
[02:38:22.122 --> 02:38:32.325]  And you go back and you talk about it, and you go back to the plantation where there's like 200 slaves, and you say, I know how to speak English, and I heard a man there getting beat up, a white man, saying we shouldn't be slaves.
[02:38:35.578 --> 02:38:36.699]  I mean, that's the same thing.
[02:38:36.759 --> 02:38:45.006]  You're in Germany, and everybody's a bunch of cowards, and they go along with what you were told, or what they said to you, and it's just not true.
[02:38:45.686 --> 02:38:47.227]  So, A, don't care.
[02:38:47.247 --> 02:38:51.291]  I mean, I'm not, I wouldn't physically do this.
[02:38:51.331 --> 02:38:52.552]  Most people are embarrassed being naked.
[02:38:52.572 --> 02:38:55.494]  I could walk out in front of a billion people naked, and everybody would make fun of me.
[02:38:56.315 --> 02:39:00.238]  It doesn't matter, because I innately have who I am, and I'm not somebody special.
[02:39:01.294 --> 02:39:05.418]  I'm just saying, I innately have my own confidence, and I don't care.
[02:39:06.019 --> 02:39:15.028]  And I realize that they ridicule and attack me and lie about me and everything, thinking not that they'll change me, but that those of you will change and not believe in yourselves.
[02:39:16.210 --> 02:39:17.050]  So he was asking what?
[02:39:18.573 --> 02:39:19.955]  I forgot.
[02:39:19.975 --> 02:39:23.961]  I know, he's in Germany and he says, people call me crazy.
[02:39:23.981 --> 02:39:25.143]  How do we make America great again?
[02:39:25.543 --> 02:39:27.767]  When do you think the EU will figure it out?
[02:39:27.787 --> 02:39:29.910]  Globalism plays all the countries off against each other.
[02:39:30.210 --> 02:39:31.552]  Who can lower their wages the most?
[02:39:31.913 --> 02:39:33.154]  And then we all implode.
[02:39:33.475 --> 02:39:34.476]  So let's make everybody great!
[02:39:35.305 --> 02:39:38.966]  I hope the Mexicans start charging, you know, $50 an hour.
[02:39:39.366 --> 02:39:41.787]  I hope they build us a beautiful country.
[02:39:41.867 --> 02:39:44.107]  Big ass, huge high-rises and a place to move to.
[02:39:44.427 --> 02:39:46.628]  I want South Africa or Nigeria or anywhere.
[02:39:47.028 --> 02:39:48.248]  I'm not out to get them.
[02:39:48.768 --> 02:39:51.229]  I shouldn't have to fail so they succeed.
[02:39:51.249 --> 02:39:53.870]  They sell this idea and play us off against each other.
[02:39:53.890 --> 02:39:54.630]  So that's my answer.
[02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:56.910]  What do you do to make America great again?
[02:39:58.751 --> 02:39:59.691]  Rediscover Germany.
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:01.560]  Rediscover Europe.
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:02.661]  Rediscover Asia.
[02:40:02.961 --> 02:40:03.861]  Rediscover other countries.
[02:40:03.901 --> 02:40:07.462]  Rediscover that nation states aren't perfect, but they're firewalls for globalism.
[02:40:07.742 --> 02:40:16.824]  At least there's cultures and ideas and something behind it and a bunch of people that usually died to stop a bunch of warlords controlling everything.
[02:40:17.625 --> 02:40:29.188]  And then realize that when you actually are serious and really politically involved and not just spewing a bunch of race BS, you can have an effect in government and then be the change, as Gandhi said, you want to be in the world.
[02:40:30.711 --> 02:40:31.131]  Good answer.
[02:40:32.092 --> 02:40:37.614]  Ghosts of Jeb's Campaign says, Alex, Reddit clowns are mocking Trump's six-year-old granddaughter on the front page right now.
[02:40:37.954 --> 02:40:38.855]  Call them out, please.
[02:40:40.436 --> 02:40:48.800]  I mean, they've called themselves out that they think that, I mean, these are the most weak people you've ever seen to beat up women at rallies.
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:53.322]  I mean, if I was going to go to a rally, I'd find, if I was going to do it, the biggest, baddest guy and attack him.
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:57.041]  But then, okay, they won't even do that.
[02:40:57.101 --> 02:40:58.822]  They won't even hit the biggest guy from behind.
[02:40:59.362 --> 02:41:08.765]  They go and they try to destroy Trump's businesses, attack his daughters, intimidate him, get them to panic, go to him, attack his grand family.
[02:41:09.525 --> 02:41:11.966]  And, I mean, people say, how do we respond to this?
[02:41:12.346 --> 02:41:13.807]  I just don't have anything to say.
[02:41:14.387 --> 02:41:23.590]  The whole left endorses North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, all these collapsing hellholes that oppress people because they're all, I remember,
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:36.989]  I already had jobs and stuff in high school, but I remember my parents when I was about 18, I was in high school five years, wasn't there, and my mom finally said, David, because, I mean, just ask me anything.
[02:41:37.409 --> 02:41:39.430]  I mean, it sounded like a war going off in the bedroom.
[02:41:40.171 --> 02:41:41.091]  My mom got sick of it.
[02:41:42.535 --> 02:41:45.216]  She came in and she said, don't bring your girlfriends here anymore.
[02:41:45.236 --> 02:41:46.836]  Sounded like, you know, jackhammer's going off.
[02:41:47.557 --> 02:41:50.477]  And I ignored her and then it happened again.
[02:41:50.497 --> 02:41:51.678]  My parents went out of town.
[02:41:51.698 --> 02:41:53.678]  She's like, somebody was in my bed.
[02:41:53.698 --> 02:41:55.299]  What the hell's going on?
[02:41:56.019 --> 02:41:58.380]  And she told my dad, get him out of here.
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:00.301]  He goes, you're an adult.
[02:42:00.501 --> 02:42:01.741]  Go do your own deal.
[02:42:01.761 --> 02:42:02.841]  I'm not bragging about women.
[02:42:02.861 --> 02:42:03.441]  It's a true story.
[02:42:03.461 --> 02:42:07.783]  I got thrown out for, you know, just constant, you know, let's just say I like women.
[02:42:08.403 --> 02:42:09.943]  And so that was ongoing.
[02:42:10.804 --> 02:42:11.344]  What was the question?
[02:42:12.629 --> 02:42:13.949]  I forgot again.
[02:42:14.209 --> 02:42:14.569]  What was it?
[02:42:14.589 --> 02:42:18.270]  It was about... I already scrolled way down.
[02:42:18.310 --> 02:42:19.791]  No, I mean, ask me anything late at night.
[02:42:19.811 --> 02:42:21.151]  I'm like answering the questions for real.
[02:42:21.191 --> 02:42:21.771]  I can't remember.
[02:42:22.331 --> 02:42:23.932]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:42:24.012 --> 02:42:25.332]  Oh, we're mocking Chuck's granddaughter.
[02:42:25.492 --> 02:42:29.233]  I don't remember how I got kicked out or how that happened or why it matters.
[02:42:29.613 --> 02:42:34.374]  Oh, I was talking to people.
[02:42:35.467 --> 02:42:37.928]  So all these leftists never leave their parents' houses.
[02:42:37.948 --> 02:42:40.449]  They're always scared to ask a girl out or ask a guy out.
[02:42:40.689 --> 02:42:43.330]  They admit they're arrested, but 90% live in their parents' basements at like 40.
[02:42:43.470 --> 02:42:45.391]  I'm not saying you're bad if you still do that.
[02:42:45.411 --> 02:42:47.451]  The economy's imploded, but it's a group.
[02:42:47.831 --> 02:42:56.755]  So they're pissed about guys that got wives, and guys that got girlfriends, or women that got husbands, and got cars, and got boats, and are building stuff, even though we build the economy.
[02:42:57.055 --> 02:43:03.057]  They're just a bunch of losers that are pissed, that are allied with the government, and don't know what to do.
[02:43:03.797 --> 02:43:07.248]  And just want to bring society down in a giant pissing contest.
[02:43:08.214 --> 02:43:12.277]  And so if you ask why they want to bring everything down, it's because they're living in their parents' basements.
[02:43:12.698 --> 02:43:19.603]  Instead of finally moving out, doing your own thing, being your own person, you're not supposed to be in your parents' house.
[02:43:20.104 --> 02:43:23.266]  You're supposed to set up your own nest with your own mate, do your own thing.
[02:43:23.486 --> 02:43:26.168]  You're not supposed to be in your parents' house doing this.
[02:43:26.208 --> 02:43:34.295]  But they don't have their own house, so they want government to go out and get rid of other people's houses, other people's nests, because they're jealous other people have nests.
[02:43:34.335 --> 02:43:35.716]  Well, build a frickin' nest!
[02:43:35.776 --> 02:43:36.497]  It ain't that hard!
[02:43:37.037 --> 02:43:38.338]  But see, they don't want you to have kids.
[02:43:39.759 --> 02:43:42.961]  And there's always been gay people, and I'm not going to use your word, homosexuals.
[02:43:43.841 --> 02:43:44.542]  There's always been that.
[02:43:45.022 --> 02:43:50.085]  So they tell people, you know, people that are heterosexual, they're messing up your world.
[02:43:50.125 --> 02:43:52.226]  The fact that they exist don't make you exist.
[02:43:52.667 --> 02:43:53.487]  You want to go build a nest?
[02:43:53.527 --> 02:43:54.408]  Do that there as well.
[02:43:54.468 --> 02:43:57.069]  But humanity is based on building these nests.
[02:43:57.129 --> 02:43:57.590]  Next question.
[02:43:57.610 --> 02:43:58.390]  I'm going to do five more minutes.
[02:43:59.551 --> 02:44:01.552]  What can we do as individuals to fight the globalists?
[02:44:01.632 --> 02:44:04.194]  And as an Arizonan, how do we get rid of John McCain?
[02:44:05.353 --> 02:44:06.053]  About time for that guy.
[02:44:06.113 --> 02:44:07.294]  I mean, he rigs the elections.
[02:44:07.354 --> 02:44:09.134]  Travis Kelly and Austin have rigged elections.
[02:44:09.154 --> 02:44:10.274]  Stuff's come out in the news.
[02:44:10.754 --> 02:44:12.735]  John McCain's a fixture of the globalists.
[02:44:12.775 --> 02:44:17.436]  He's a totally horrible person who sounded like a canary when he was shot down.
[02:44:17.496 --> 02:44:21.057]  And he's constantly trying to start wars.
[02:44:21.337 --> 02:44:27.639]  And John McCain, his shelf-life expectancy has basically ended.
[02:44:27.659 --> 02:44:29.139]  I don't mean that as some threat.
[02:44:29.559 --> 02:44:32.280]  It's like John McCain is just a complete demon.
[02:44:33.769 --> 02:44:41.356]  Two Spoons Johnson has the most important question of the night, and he says, would you rather fight a globalist-sized lizard or a hundred lizard-sized globalists?
[02:44:42.336 --> 02:44:42.777]  Say that again?
[02:44:43.377 --> 02:44:49.783]  Would you rather fight a globalist-sized lizard or a hundred lizard-sized globalists?
[02:44:51.813 --> 02:44:55.977]  That's a big huge global, a big huge lizard or a hundred little, little tiny lizards.
[02:44:55.997 --> 02:44:58.500]  He's always making the joke, that's David Octavius' lizard people.
[02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:00.121]  I think he's a psychopath with lizard brains.
[02:45:00.622 --> 02:45:02.063]  But that's also like a Reddit thing.
[02:45:02.083 --> 02:45:05.226]  They always ask about a horse or like if you would fight midgets or whatever.
[02:45:05.286 --> 02:45:06.327]  This is a classic.
[02:45:06.367 --> 02:45:07.068]  Maybe I'm dumb.
[02:45:07.088 --> 02:45:08.089]  See, I'm kind of a moron.
[02:45:09.030 --> 02:45:11.632]  A globalist sized lizard could be any size I wanted.
[02:45:12.573 --> 02:45:14.174]  So the question is how big is a globalist?
[02:45:14.575 --> 02:45:15.055]  Exactly.
[02:45:15.896 --> 02:45:16.336]  Instead of a
[02:45:18.351 --> 02:45:20.213]  Hundred lizards of the size of... Say it again?
[02:45:20.653 --> 02:45:20.894]  Okay.
[02:45:21.054 --> 02:45:23.236]  The question is... It's a key calculus.
[02:45:23.676 --> 02:45:24.197]  Exactly.
[02:45:24.978 --> 02:45:32.025]  Would you rather fight a globalist-sized lizard, big huge lizard, or a hundred lizard-sized globalist?
[02:45:32.065 --> 02:45:33.767]  So a bunch of little teeny-tiny George Soroses.
[02:45:33.787 --> 02:45:34.267]  No, that's true.
[02:45:34.287 --> 02:45:36.629]  They're a bunch of small people that want total control.
[02:45:36.730 --> 02:45:37.991]  They could like swarm you.
[02:45:38.011 --> 02:45:38.752]  I get the point.
[02:45:39.312 --> 02:45:40.533]  I mean, it's all the same thing.
[02:45:41.073 --> 02:45:43.994]  Globalists are conning themselves, thinking they've got full control of humanity.
[02:45:44.755 --> 02:45:53.899]  And so, I would rather humanity just wake up that globalism is a claim that somebody else controls everything, and you should just give them power in some far-off group.
[02:45:53.939 --> 02:45:56.261]  So, I say bring all of them on.
[02:45:56.921 --> 02:45:57.181]  Both.
[02:45:57.481 --> 02:46:02.684]  Alex said he will fight both the globalist-sized lizard and the hundred-sized globalist at the same time.
[02:46:03.004 --> 02:46:03.184]  Right?
[02:46:03.825 --> 02:46:06.506]  Well, the truth is, the globalist-sized lizard is not that big.
[02:46:09.897 --> 02:46:14.559]  Shagwan says, Patriot Jones, are you a fan of our affectionate Alex Jones based memes?
[02:46:15.379 --> 02:46:19.020]  I love them, including, I mean, I'm a big fan of stuff making fun of me, so just keep it up.
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.582]  I love all these globalists that literally, they get freaked out if something makes fun of them because they're such narcissists.
[02:46:24.142 --> 02:46:25.123]  I think it's great stuff.
[02:46:25.263 --> 02:46:29.484]  I love the fact, I think when they said Baron releases his Alex Jones clone army.
[02:46:30.765 --> 02:46:32.626]  I'm glad you put that up, that's one of my favorites right there.
[02:46:32.986 --> 02:46:33.546]  That's good.
[02:46:35.109 --> 02:46:36.689]  Um, we put that like Google, yeah.
[02:46:36.709 --> 02:46:39.210]  Barron releases his, uh, if you Google it'll come up.
[02:46:40.530 --> 02:46:43.191]  But folks, I'm not here claiming I've got all the answers.
[02:46:43.291 --> 02:46:46.132]  The point is, is that InfoWars has changed the world.
[02:46:46.692 --> 02:46:52.033]  We're having this fundraiser because we just lost 3.3 million dollars is what it made last year to fund things.
[02:46:52.073 --> 02:46:53.254]  That's actually not that much.
[02:46:54.254 --> 02:46:55.794]  Like 40 million to fund things usually.
[02:46:55.814 --> 02:46:57.195]  But that's a big part of the piece.
[02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:01.201]  You know, they just blocked it all.
[02:47:01.241 --> 02:47:02.522]  It's been like 5 million this year.
[02:47:03.322 --> 02:47:05.364]  And, uh, you know, it's just frustrating.
[02:47:05.684 --> 02:47:07.005]  Everybody else can have websites.
[02:47:07.065 --> 02:47:08.707]  Everybody else can advertise on Google.
[02:47:08.987 --> 02:47:10.208]  We're advertising totally.
[02:47:10.708 --> 02:47:11.689]  Nobody's been convicted.
[02:47:11.729 --> 02:47:12.650]  Nobody's been charged.
[02:47:12.930 --> 02:47:15.091]  It's all totally water filters and t-shirts.
[02:47:15.512 --> 02:47:16.733]  I just say, hey, you don't exist.
[02:47:17.253 --> 02:47:18.254]  Go to the Jewish ghetto.
[02:47:18.274 --> 02:47:25.920]  And I use the Nazi Germany analogy, but it was a year plus ago that Drudge said it's an electronic ghetto.
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:26.720]  Exactly.
[02:47:27.701 --> 02:47:27.901]  Exactly.
[02:47:28.562 --> 02:47:28.842]  Go ahead.
[02:47:30.272 --> 02:47:40.241]  Fort Tung says, Alex, years ago on air you drew up a pyramid of power and named names at the top of the capstone to the minions under them and so on and explained how it works with compartmentalization and all the rest.
[02:47:40.341 --> 02:47:42.483]  Anyway, you could do an updated version of this tonight.
[02:47:42.503 --> 02:47:46.046]  There are so many people new to all this that I think it might- Sure, can you send us a video?
[02:47:46.066 --> 02:47:46.527]  We'll play it.
[02:47:47.588 --> 02:47:54.534]  There's the big mega banks that know how to just get the public to back them and they just create endless credit for themselves and they don't loan it to the public.
[02:47:54.554 --> 02:47:55.114]  That's the top.
[02:47:55.414 --> 02:47:56.656]  And Trump is short of the Federal Reserve.
[02:47:57.862 --> 02:48:07.985]  Um, 37 days ago when he got elected, day one he said, I'm ordering Yellen to loan a trillion dollars in the next two years to small businesses.
[02:48:08.425 --> 02:48:10.146]  They already took tens of trillions for themselves.
[02:48:10.766 --> 02:48:12.947]  And that what's made small business now the highest number since 84.
[02:48:13.107 --> 02:48:14.547]  The money ain't got there.
[02:48:14.567 --> 02:48:15.487]  They're ignoring him.
[02:48:15.507 --> 02:48:16.548]  They're acting like he's not there.
[02:48:16.588 --> 02:48:20.889]  That's what's scary, folks, is from the State Department, the Federal Reserve, they're just going, we're not doing it.
[02:48:21.854 --> 02:48:23.637]  These are how arrogant and entitled they are.
[02:48:23.677 --> 02:48:24.900]  We elect him, they won't do it.
[02:48:25.601 --> 02:48:28.506]  So, you know, there's your answer right there.
[02:48:29.087 --> 02:48:31.852]  Heroin Harrison says, would you ever consider going on tour?
[02:48:33.513 --> 02:48:55.697]  You know, it's not that I'm afraid of stuff, but it's security issues, and then you try to get the places to speak, and then they always change the deal, and it's all this money, and you just digitally talk to people, and so, you know, I just, I go to the Milo thing, you'll have them try to ban me and be all the news, but it's like, I want people intellectually to hear what I say.
[02:48:55.717 --> 02:48:59.978]  It's almost like somebody watching Fox News, not against Fox, but it's true, you're not
[02:49:01.647 --> 02:49:04.111]  I mean, her grandmother just died a few weeks ago, 92 years old.
[02:49:04.812 --> 02:49:06.774]  She was watching Fox News and she wasn't there.
[02:49:06.794 --> 02:49:13.844]  I don't mean God rest her soul, it's kind of like, let the dead bury the dead, you know, dust the soles of your feet off.
[02:49:14.645 --> 02:49:17.449]  I love her, she was awake and great, but I'm just not...
[02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:22.451]  Like, trying to be, ooh, Sean Hannity talked about you, ooh, you were on Fox News.
[02:49:23.031 --> 02:49:28.633]  You don't get more than a few minutes out on that, oh look, Alex Jones was at something, there was a riot, they tried to kill him, you know, isn't that?
[02:49:29.193 --> 02:49:31.234]  Man, I could pull that crap ten years ago, man.
[02:49:31.734 --> 02:49:34.955]  It's like, I'm really trying to have a long, hour-long discussion with somebody.
[02:49:35.735 --> 02:49:39.399]  About, hey, read the vaccine memo in the insert you're about to take.
[02:49:39.459 --> 02:49:42.703]  It says you can give your kids type 1 diabetes with pancreatitis.
[02:49:42.803 --> 02:49:43.424]  Oh, read that.
[02:49:43.584 --> 02:49:45.486]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:49:45.526 --> 02:49:47.288]  I really don't want more kids like that.
[02:49:47.348 --> 02:49:48.049]  I feel guilty.
[02:49:48.149 --> 02:49:48.970]  I'm not doing enough.
[02:49:49.411 --> 02:49:51.393]  Not because I'm some goody-two-shoes angel.
[02:49:51.593 --> 02:49:55.798]  I'm connected to everybody, so I can't be involved in screwing people over.
[02:49:57.312 --> 02:49:57.792]  Good answer.
[02:49:57.832 --> 02:49:58.593]  So no tours.
[02:49:59.613 --> 02:50:01.955]  Alex Jones, thank you for taking our questions.
[02:50:01.995 --> 02:50:09.619]  I'm just curious to know your thoughts on what you believe is the most plausible worst case scenario you could conceive given all the information that you had.
[02:50:09.679 --> 02:50:11.521]  I gotta stop after this one because my back hurts.
[02:50:12.201 --> 02:50:15.523]  I gotta get Millie in here and tell the folks who've been waiting all day to take some phone calls.
[02:50:17.364 --> 02:50:18.185]  Worst case scenario.
[02:50:19.905 --> 02:50:26.326]  Bill Gates came out two days ago and said give me world government and have Chelsea Clinton run it with her new book that came out.
[02:50:26.706 --> 02:50:32.928]  Let me forcibly inoculate everybody and make everybody pay me taxes or a bioweapon is going to kill hundreds of millions of billions.
[02:50:34.748 --> 02:50:39.669]  And then he spends billions on weather weapons and gut flora as they do everything they can to kill her.
[02:50:39.689 --> 02:50:45.430]  I mean it's just, think of like total psychopath, 50 times Jeffrey Dahmer and you get Bill Gates.
[02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:46.010]  I mean just,
[02:50:47.082 --> 02:50:50.890]  Power trip, super smart, he has a right to rule you and your family.
[02:50:50.910 --> 02:50:52.795]  What was the question?
[02:50:54.020 --> 02:50:56.962]  The question is, what's the most plausible worst case scenario?
[02:50:57.082 --> 02:50:58.082]  Oh yeah, I mean, that's it.
[02:50:58.142 --> 02:51:00.944]  I mean, look, they're already going to have nanotech get loose, all sorts of stuff.
[02:51:00.964 --> 02:51:06.887]  Like, 70 years or 65 years ago, they had weaponized ticks with syphilis and Lyme disease.
[02:51:06.927 --> 02:51:08.708]  It's already ravaged most bunch of people I know.
[02:51:08.768 --> 02:51:10.890]  I mean, you know, that's like some ancient thing.
[02:51:10.930 --> 02:51:11.990]  And it's just already spreading.
[02:51:12.050 --> 02:51:13.051]  God knows what it is.
[02:51:13.131 --> 02:51:15.292]  And they've got AI computers running it.
[02:51:15.312 --> 02:51:16.453]  Most of us are dead already.
[02:51:17.438 --> 02:51:19.765]  You know, the key is just getting people's spirits right with God.
[02:51:19.786 --> 02:51:20.588]  That's what matters.
[02:51:21.732 --> 02:51:24.260]  So you ask what they're planning, I mean, they already did it.
[02:51:25.031 --> 02:51:37.057]  Worst case scenario is thermal nuclear war, globalists in bunkers, but Bill Gates says, don't worry about that, let me take control or bioweapons will kill you, I'm tax exempt, and my dad's a eugenist, Heil Hitler, you know?
[02:51:37.137 --> 02:51:38.818]  Alright, well I'm not going to let it in on that note.
[02:51:39.098 --> 02:51:40.518]  So this is my question in the reddit.
[02:51:40.539 --> 02:51:41.399]  We'll do a few more too.
[02:51:41.479 --> 02:51:43.900]  No, no, no, what is the best case scenario?
[02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:44.841]  Where are we headed?
[02:51:45.601 --> 02:51:46.501]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:51:46.982 --> 02:51:53.505]  If humanity wakes up and realizes the advanced technology we've developed and everything we've got within
[02:51:55.726 --> 02:51:57.187]  50 years, people don't die anymore.
[02:51:59.009 --> 02:52:12.885]  You can have copies of yourself, you can go onto the stars, you can launch unlimited with trillions of galaxies, space exploration programs, spread life to the universe like we were preceded here, and you can just join with God and promote life all over the universe.
[02:52:15.936 --> 02:52:18.558]  You know, in Stranger Aeon, even death may die.
[02:52:18.578 --> 02:52:19.478]  It's just unlimited.
[02:52:19.538 --> 02:52:20.499]  God's whole promise.
[02:52:21.119 --> 02:52:21.439]  Everything.
[02:52:21.479 --> 02:52:26.582]  We're ready just to bust like a seed pod into the galaxy, into the dimensions, and just spread life everywhere.
[02:52:26.622 --> 02:52:30.545]  But we have to be challenged by evil before we're given the keys to death and hell.
[02:52:31.872 --> 02:52:36.453]  Like Christ, you know, God's personification of this.
[02:52:37.153 --> 02:52:40.914]  You can't be given all this without resonating with God.
[02:52:40.974 --> 02:52:46.295]  You can't resonate with evil to use it to screw everyone over like Zuckerberg and people and Schmitt.
[02:52:46.315 --> 02:52:48.355]  You have to understand that it's about empowering people.
[02:52:48.936 --> 02:52:55.237]  Even when they hate you and attack you and are dumbed down, you can't hate where you came from and be given the keys to the Ark of the Covenant.
[02:52:56.509 --> 02:52:57.790]  And so, the sky's the limit.
[02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:58.491]  It's unlimited.
[02:52:59.431 --> 02:53:03.034]  Just like we live through generations, the next generation, we spiritually live on.
[02:53:03.074 --> 02:53:05.776]  Not through reincarnation, that's a globalist twist.
[02:53:06.017 --> 02:53:15.424]  Because we live through the genetics in one level, but our spirits, you know, live on through the species and what we've done and we resonate with God.
[02:53:15.884 --> 02:53:17.045]  It's like, do we want God?
[02:53:17.105 --> 02:53:17.786]  It's all free will.
[02:53:17.806 --> 02:53:19.407]  A few more questions.
[02:53:20.027 --> 02:53:20.247]  Okay.
[02:53:22.694 --> 02:53:24.097]  This is Tormund, members only.
[02:53:24.117 --> 02:53:24.819]  It's kind of a comment.
[02:53:24.839 --> 02:53:29.289]  It says, Alex, I briefly met you at dinner the night before Trump's inauguration and you let me take a picture with you.
[02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:31.394]  Thanks for being so nice and based.
[02:53:33.394 --> 02:53:33.695]  Based.
[02:53:34.335 --> 02:53:34.755]  Based?
[02:53:35.916 --> 02:53:37.677]  Based means... Down to level.
[02:53:37.997 --> 02:53:49.444]  No, it means just like, like, okay so it started with this rapper and it basically means that you just don't, that you're so far and you just really don't care.
[02:53:50.004 --> 02:53:52.766]  Like you're basically so cool that you don't care.
[02:53:52.786 --> 02:53:54.286]  Yeah, no, no, let's get past that.
[02:53:54.427 --> 02:53:55.047]  Just means badass.
[02:53:55.067 --> 02:53:56.528]  Somebody who's cool with their kids.
[02:53:57.816 --> 02:54:13.871]  I want this with shining eyes what color they are when I came around to shake my hand it's very humbling but then you got to read them there's that moment where you read them they read you your spirits touch and you're like totally exhausted you shook a thousand hands that day a thousand and you just want to go eat some food.
[02:54:14.938 --> 02:54:16.579]  And so you're just like, I gotta be up to it.
[02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:17.860]  I gotta shake this hand.
[02:54:17.880 --> 02:54:18.661]  These are great people.
[02:54:18.961 --> 02:54:19.862]  I'm so honored to meet them.
[02:54:19.882 --> 02:54:20.462]  I'm so humbled.
[02:54:20.862 --> 02:54:23.605]  And that's another, and another, and another, and finally, you're just like, ugh.
[02:54:24.085 --> 02:54:27.027]  So you're just, it's the opposite of, oh, thank you for talking to me.
[02:54:27.427 --> 02:54:28.928]  Thank you for talking to me.
[02:54:28.948 --> 02:54:30.470]  I think that's how we should end it.
[02:54:30.890 --> 02:54:32.591]  Let's go to a quick clip here.
[02:54:32.651 --> 02:54:33.432]  Great job, Buckley.
[02:54:33.932 --> 02:54:36.313]  And then we're going to go to a clip here.
[02:54:36.333 --> 02:54:38.474]  What should we play while we bring in some more crew?
[02:54:38.494 --> 02:54:39.554]  Whoever wants to come in can come in.
[02:54:39.594 --> 02:54:40.374]  People can pop in.
[02:54:41.735 --> 02:54:42.835]  Let's talk about Rush Limbaugh.
[02:54:43.075 --> 02:54:43.656]  I want to play this.
[02:54:44.156 --> 02:54:47.497]  Rush Limbaugh, the whole clip, three minutes long, talks about deep state.
[02:54:47.557 --> 02:54:49.578]  The reason is it's finally all out in the open.
[02:54:50.058 --> 02:54:50.878]  This is a big deal.
[02:54:51.339 --> 02:54:53.539]  This shows like the fissure in the power structure.
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.841]  Those that just wanted power versus those that wanted to kill everybody.
[02:54:57.161 --> 02:54:57.981]  Great job to Reddit.
[02:54:58.001 --> 02:55:01.242]  We'll be back with an hour of your phone calls and Millie Weaver and others.
[02:55:01.802 --> 02:55:02.403]  We'll be right back.
[02:55:02.423 --> 02:55:02.803]  Stay with us.
[02:55:04.551 --> 02:55:12.760]  You also use a phrase which I have to say that I only heard for the first time in the last couple of weeks, the deep state.
[02:55:13.020 --> 02:55:22.449]  And that's the notion that there's an Obama shadow government embedded in the bureaucracy that is working against this new president.
[02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:27.715]  I think some folks are going to think that's right on and some folks will think it's awfully conspiratorial.
[02:55:29.068 --> 02:55:44.133]  Well, I would love to claim credit for that, but actually, I think a reporter by the name of Glenn Greenwald at The Intercept, who has got a relationship with, uh, what's his name, Assange, I think he actually coined the term, and I think it works.
[02:55:44.533 --> 02:55:48.335]  I don't think there's any... Who's driving this business that the Russians hacked the election?
[02:55:48.375 --> 02:55:49.335]  It's the Democrat Party.
[02:55:49.715 --> 02:55:50.255]  It's Hillary.
[02:55:50.295 --> 02:55:50.856]  It's Obama.
[02:55:50.916 --> 02:55:53.416]  It's all those people who just can't accept the law.
[02:55:53.436 --> 02:55:54.677]  And you think they're behind the leaks, too?
[02:55:56.324 --> 02:55:57.105]  Absolutely!
[02:55:57.145 --> 02:55:58.246]  Of course they are.
[02:55:58.526 --> 02:56:03.211]  Look, if they can't win at the ballot box, you know they're down 1,200 seats since 2010.
[02:56:03.251 --> 02:56:05.953]  They've become a marginal party electorally.
[02:56:06.013 --> 02:56:11.618]  All they've got is their embeds in the bureaucracy and the judiciary, and they're pulling out all the stops.
[02:56:11.638 --> 02:56:12.639]  There's no question.
[02:56:12.679 --> 02:56:19.806]  This business that the Russians hacked the election, this is serious, serious allegation that is impossible.
[02:56:20.086 --> 02:56:26.068]  The Russians could not have had any impact whatsoever on voting, either how they were cast or how they were counted.
[02:56:26.468 --> 02:56:29.629]  In fact, if you want to say they did, they did their job.
[02:56:29.669 --> 02:56:30.929]  Hillary won the popular vote.
[02:56:31.249 --> 02:56:33.110]  How could they have possibly had any?
[02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:44.533]  This whole premise, and it's been driving news coverage here ever since Trump took office and even before, and there's, you don't need any more evidence than that to suggest and to know that the left
[02:56:45.111 --> 02:56:54.295]  Which is run by Obama and Hillary and the hierarchy of the Democrat Party is doing everything they can to undermine, sabotage, and to prevent Trump from implementing his agenda.
[02:56:54.315 --> 02:56:55.356]  There's no question about it.
[02:56:55.656 --> 02:56:56.737]  I know what Trump should do.
[02:56:57.157 --> 02:56:58.878]  Well, I'm going to get to that in a second.
[02:57:00.698 --> 02:57:04.580]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[02:57:04.820 --> 02:57:07.882]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[02:57:12.151 --> 02:57:16.075]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[02:57:16.135 --> 02:57:18.858]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:57:18.958 --> 02:57:24.164]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:57:24.324 --> 02:57:31.391]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[02:57:36.303 --> 02:57:42.406]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[02:57:42.446 --> 02:57:48.248]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[02:57:48.268 --> 02:57:52.350]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[02:57:52.430 --> 02:57:57.312]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[02:57:57.353 --> 02:58:02.095]  From the front lines of the info room, it's Alex Jones.
[02:58:05.578 --> 02:58:08.125]  You found a trap!
[02:58:08.145 --> 02:58:09.107]  You found a trap!
[02:58:09.167 --> 02:58:11.192]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please stop.
[02:58:31.949 --> 02:58:33.069]  It's never gonna get any better.
[02:58:33.470 --> 02:58:34.210]  Don't look for it.
[02:58:34.650 --> 02:58:35.771]  Be happy with what you got.
[02:58:36.911 --> 02:58:39.992]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[02:58:40.512 --> 02:58:42.213]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[02:58:42.553 --> 02:58:48.216]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[02:58:48.596 --> 02:58:49.816]  Forget the politicians.
[02:58:50.056 --> 02:58:53.298]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[02:58:54.878 --> 02:58:55.319]  You don't.
[02:58:56.119 --> 02:58:57.100]  You have no choice.
[02:58:57.460 --> 02:58:58.401]  You have owners.
[02:58:58.701 --> 02:58:59.762]  They own you.
[02:59:00.982 --> 02:59:02.283]  They own everything.
[02:59:02.303 --> 02:59:04.144]  They own all the important land.
[02:59:04.505 --> 02:59:06.266]  They own and control the corporations.
[02:59:06.286 --> 02:59:09.768]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[02:59:09.788 --> 02:59:11.369]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[02:59:11.689 --> 02:59:16.533]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[02:59:16.693 --> 02:59:18.314]  They got you by the balls!
[02:59:19.821 --> 02:59:21.882]  They want obedient workers.
[02:59:21.922 --> 02:59:23.843]  Obedient workers.
[02:59:24.163 --> 02:59:36.848]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[02:59:36.928 --> 02:59:40.190]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:43.311]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[02:59:44.711 --> 02:59:45.632]  It's a big club.
[02:59:46.624 --> 02:59:47.645]  And you ain't in it.
[02:59:47.665 --> 02:59:52.968]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[02:59:53.328 --> 02:59:54.209]  You better believe it.
[02:59:54.309 --> 02:59:56.170]  So what specifically did they do?
[02:59:56.631 --> 03:00:01.774]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[03:00:01.794 --> 03:00:02.634]  A lot of money.
[03:00:03.255 --> 03:00:05.957]  You and I are not in the big club.
[03:00:06.317 --> 03:00:08.238]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[03:00:08.898 --> 03:00:12.601]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[03:00:14.022 --> 03:00:15.503]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[03:00:15.883 --> 03:00:19.364]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[03:00:19.384 --> 03:00:23.306]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[03:00:23.346 --> 03:00:24.287]  They're not interested in that.
[03:00:24.567 --> 03:00:25.507]  That doesn't help them.
[03:00:25.888 --> 03:00:27.248]  That's against their interest.
[03:00:27.748 --> 03:00:28.169]  That's right.
[03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:33.351]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.411 --> 03:00:37.533]  You know, one of our reporters interviewed George Carlin like six months before he died.
[03:00:38.740 --> 03:00:40.802]  And he knew 9-11 was an inside job, everything.
[03:00:40.822 --> 03:00:42.704]  What a smart guy from Fort Worth, Texas.
[03:00:43.465 --> 03:00:45.767]  And his dad had been a big exec in New York when he was a kid.
[03:00:45.787 --> 03:00:48.910]  They moved to Texas, so that New York-Texas thing kind of mutates well together.
[03:00:49.911 --> 03:00:53.675]  It's crazy how New York and Texas actually get along, but it's all Americana.
[03:00:53.995 --> 03:00:59.401]  And I was just thinking about all the things we've been through, all the things we've done together.
[03:01:00.516 --> 03:01:08.678]  And, you know, the fact that it's depressing to me that they took away our Google Ads with AdRoll, which were $3.3 million last year.
[03:01:08.798 --> 03:01:09.618]  Oh, God, you made that money?
[03:01:09.658 --> 03:01:10.559]  No, that was to fund this.
[03:01:10.579 --> 03:01:13.359]  This is expensive, all this and equipment and the rest of it.
[03:01:13.679 --> 03:01:18.721]  The big part of that, though, and then, it would probably have been $5 million this year.
[03:01:18.741 --> 03:01:19.541]  That's how the graph was going.
[03:01:19.561 --> 03:01:20.521]  We've been doing it three years.
[03:01:21.281 --> 03:01:25.463]  But it just shows, and we've learned now since we were on air, they've done it to a bunch of other big sites today.
[03:01:25.483 --> 03:01:26.823]  We'll be talking about tomorrow.
[03:01:27.884 --> 03:01:33.146]  And it's really kind of an honor to have these people behind to blacklist us for what we stand for.
[03:01:33.646 --> 03:01:35.346]  So we've got Millie Weaver, we've got Leanne McAdoo.
[03:01:35.366 --> 03:01:37.007]  I appreciate you staying so late tonight.
[03:01:37.467 --> 03:01:38.967]  Wild horses couldn't drag you away.
[03:01:38.987 --> 03:01:47.350]  I don't even want to sit here and say, hey, get a non-GMO, you know, heirloom seed pack or get a water filter system that are great.
[03:01:48.490 --> 03:01:55.712]  I always love how, when the New York Times or CNN or anybody calls me, they laugh and go, you sell water filters, and they laugh.
[03:01:55.812 --> 03:01:56.492]  What a bad guy.
[03:01:56.592 --> 03:02:07.895]  It's so fundamental, like, you don't trust the government, drink your water supply, when it's full of glyphosate and every poison and every rich person filters their water, and Home Depot sells them, but we're bad.
[03:02:07.935 --> 03:02:14.637]  It's like this idea, they take the most obvious thing that's our strength, then they act like we've been exposed and we're bad.
[03:02:14.677 --> 03:02:16.498]  It's some type of weird tactic.
[03:02:16.538 --> 03:02:17.618]  What do you guys think that is?
[03:02:18.410 --> 03:02:26.417]  Well, you know, I think it's pretty crazy how, you know, they expect people to just blindly fall in line, blindly trust the government.
[03:02:27.117 --> 03:02:31.661]  Oh yeah, fluoride, okay, that's good to drink fluoride when it's poison.
[03:02:31.681 --> 03:02:34.884]  I mean, and they push it on little children too.
[03:02:34.924 --> 03:02:40.509]  When you take your kid to the dentist, they want little babies to be brushing their teeth with fluoride.
[03:02:40.849 --> 03:02:42.671]  I mean, that just sounds pretty absurd to me.
[03:02:43.191 --> 03:02:48.274]  And by the way, finally the American Dental Association three years ago had to admit, don't give it to kids, it causes fluorosis.
[03:02:48.654 --> 03:02:48.854]  Right.
[03:02:48.934 --> 03:02:49.134]  Yeah.
[03:02:49.254 --> 03:02:51.976]  And obviously people are like, well there's naturally occurring fluoride.
[03:02:52.036 --> 03:02:52.616]  Yes, there is.
[03:02:52.716 --> 03:02:53.457]  Calcium fluoride.
[03:02:53.477 --> 03:02:56.178]  Naturally occurring fluoride, but that is not what they use.
[03:02:56.218 --> 03:02:58.239]  They use hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:02:58.299 --> 03:02:58.960]  And it's like 1-1000.
[03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:00.481]  It's not naturally occurring.
[03:03:00.621 --> 03:03:00.941]  Good point.
[03:03:01.301 --> 03:03:04.263]  It's just ridiculous, and that's the thing that they always try to debunk you with.
[03:03:04.363 --> 03:03:07.366]  Oh, well, fluoride, it's on the periodic table.
[03:03:07.606 --> 03:03:08.286]  It's like, no.
[03:03:08.687 --> 03:03:26.701]  And the thing that I really thought was so frustrating is last year, earlier, yeah, last year when we were covering Flint, Michigan, that they would actually come after us about the water filters when national, international news is how disgusting the water is here, not just in Flint, Michigan, but across the country.
[03:03:26.761 --> 03:03:29.383]  Sure, they take something completely normal.
[03:03:30.316 --> 03:03:31.736]  And then, like, Salon Magazine.
[03:03:31.776 --> 03:03:33.517]  How dare you not like pedophilia?
[03:03:35.078 --> 03:03:37.018]  Do you know that they actually had to delete all of those?
[03:03:37.318 --> 03:03:47.441]  Salon, in order to trash Milo, they actually deleted all of the articles that they put out with this guy that they were like, I'm a pedophile, but I'm not a bad guy.
[03:03:47.501 --> 03:03:50.482]  You should, you know, you should like me or listen to my story.
[03:03:50.542 --> 03:03:52.143]  I'm a pedophile, but I don't act on it.
[03:03:52.403 --> 03:03:56.224]  They had to delete all that stuff off Salon in order to bash Milo.
[03:03:56.244 --> 03:03:57.164]  Who was a rape victim.
[03:03:57.444 --> 03:03:58.825]  Right, who came out and said stuff.
[03:03:59.665 --> 03:04:01.586]  I don't defend everything he even said, exactly.
[03:04:01.606 --> 03:04:04.327]  The point is, he's like, oh, I'm not a victim of Stockholm Syndrome.
[03:04:05.067 --> 03:04:09.930]  Well, the thing is, is that, unfortunately, that is a very common thing.
[03:04:09.990 --> 03:04:14.552]  It's seen as a rite of passage within the young gay male community.
[03:04:14.992 --> 03:04:16.152]  And it's a problem.
[03:04:16.272 --> 03:04:18.173]  And it is sexual assault.
[03:04:18.613 --> 03:04:22.535]  And that's why they're sexualizing in school, is to target young people.
[03:04:22.555 --> 03:04:24.496]  We're not against gay people, but don't target kids.
[03:04:24.836 --> 03:04:26.377]  They're mainlining pedophilia through that.
[03:04:26.397 --> 03:04:26.797]  It's a fact.
[03:04:27.237 --> 03:04:36.643]  And they try to tell these young gay males that, oh, this is just a rite of passage that these older men are trolling for these young boys at their cruising locations or whatever.
[03:04:36.683 --> 03:04:41.666]  So, frankly, it opened up a good dialogue where young gay people can say, you know what?
[03:04:42.166 --> 03:04:43.967]  Actually, this is bad and this is sexual assault.
[03:04:44.007 --> 03:04:44.668]  It's not normal.
[03:04:44.708 --> 03:04:49.611]  But they try to say, oh, well, the Greeks did it and they still do it in Afghanistan.
[03:04:49.631 --> 03:04:52.513]  People always grab kids out of their backyards.
[03:04:52.553 --> 03:04:54.454]  Yeah, it's just totally loving.
[03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:55.930]  They love children.
[03:04:56.351 --> 03:05:06.315]  Yeah, and so, I mean, at least Milo did apologize for what he said, and it really just seemed like they were just trying to do this to attack him, because this video was over a year old.
[03:05:06.355 --> 03:05:08.136]  Sure, they always knew what he'd said.
[03:05:08.496 --> 03:05:15.620]  Well, George Takai, the Star Trek guy, there was actually some video, I didn't watch the video, but I saw there was a whole article written, I think possibly The Daily Caller.
[03:05:16.340 --> 03:05:21.241]  He said pretty much the exact same thing that Milo said because that's the issue.
[03:05:21.281 --> 03:05:29.124]  It's a very common thing within the gay community, especially back in the day when you had to really hide your sexuality.
[03:05:29.144 --> 03:05:33.925]  Yeah, you got guys with arrested development and sex problems.
[03:05:34.685 --> 03:05:47.872]  And it's one thing, again, it's known psychology, they're scared of women to begin with, then they're even scared of men, but maybe some older man did it to them, so they think that's how you have sex is with a young child, or a young teenager.
[03:05:48.632 --> 03:05:55.816]  And it's just a bunch of beta males that are pissed off and they're going to the UN and NAMBLA saying, give us your kids.
[03:05:56.516 --> 03:05:57.797]  And it's a lobby for the UN.
[03:05:57.877 --> 03:05:59.538]  I mean, that's all it is, they just can't handle it.
[03:05:59.818 --> 03:06:06.120]  And you have to kind of wonder with all of the estrogen mimickers that they're putting in the food supply and water supply.
[03:06:06.140 --> 03:06:07.380]  Oh, they admit it's a plan.
[03:06:07.500 --> 03:06:08.660]  That's why they attacked me.
[03:06:08.700 --> 03:06:12.821]  And notice in the video, though, they show a little five-year-old going to school, like one that might get grabbed.
[03:06:13.402 --> 03:06:15.422]  So it's like he's stalking her, but it's okay.
[03:06:15.442 --> 03:06:17.122]  You know, your daughter's going to school.
[03:06:17.143 --> 03:06:18.103]  She's five years old.
[03:06:18.183 --> 03:06:19.243]  He's talking about his fantasy.
[03:06:19.283 --> 03:06:20.703]  He's got a crepazoid following him.
[03:06:20.723 --> 03:06:21.224]  It's alright.
[03:06:21.364 --> 03:06:22.244]  And who the heck...
[03:06:23.364 --> 03:06:26.787]  Look at this, he's just a little girl, he's like lusting after her.
[03:06:26.967 --> 03:06:34.914]  The video is all in like this fuzzy thing so that we can... And imagine the arrested development that he doesn't want a full-blown woman.
[03:06:35.154 --> 03:06:41.760]  And this is Salon who was trying to push for pedophilia and these other groups trying to say that this is a different kind of sexual identity.
[03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:45.463]  To like get it classified as a legit... Yeah, no, that's the next thing.
[03:06:45.543 --> 03:06:47.945]  Oh, there's 50 sexualities on Facebook, and oh...
[03:06:48.966 --> 03:06:50.568]  One that likes kids, is that alright?
[03:06:50.629 --> 03:06:59.860]  Yeah, so they were trying to openly promote pedophilia and get people to wrap their head around it as, oh, this is this guy's sexuality, you know.
[03:06:59.880 --> 03:07:00.802]  He's not a monster.
[03:07:00.822 --> 03:07:01.903]  He can't help it, remember?
[03:07:02.183 --> 03:07:03.946]  Sexuality is not by choice.
[03:07:04.406 --> 03:07:08.187]  And they've even got us now talking about them exactly normalizing it.
[03:07:08.567 --> 03:07:09.807]  Well, we're doing this fundraiser.
[03:07:09.847 --> 03:07:10.847]  There's a lot to cover here.
[03:07:10.867 --> 03:07:11.828]  I want to open the phones up.
[03:07:12.668 --> 03:07:14.408]  What's our number here at Ark Studios?
[03:07:14.428 --> 03:07:15.028]  I always forget it.
[03:07:15.048 --> 03:07:16.488]  Maybe you guys can put it on screen for me.
[03:07:16.849 --> 03:07:21.369]  Again, the poor crew is going to come back in in like, you know, ten hours or less, eight hours back in here.
[03:07:21.389 --> 03:07:21.830]  Me too.
[03:07:22.730 --> 03:07:24.410]  But, you know, 11 a.m.
[03:07:24.430 --> 03:07:25.210]  tomorrow at Central.
[03:07:25.230 --> 03:07:27.191]  We're going to play some excerpts of this show tonight.
[03:07:27.211 --> 03:07:28.971]  I want to play some excerpts of what you're talking about.
[03:07:29.011 --> 03:07:32.252]  But I feel bad even talking about what they're talking about.
[03:07:32.332 --> 03:07:32.952]  I would never
[03:07:33.737 --> 03:07:36.379]  Look at a kid and even have any type of attraction.
[03:07:36.940 --> 03:07:41.643]  And as I get older, older women become more attractive, just being quite point-blank.
[03:07:42.884 --> 03:07:45.927]  I can't imagine media normalizing this.
[03:07:46.207 --> 03:07:46.948]  Right.
[03:07:46.968 --> 03:07:51.692]  And the only reason why they've pulled back a little bit is so that they can take out one of their enemies.
[03:07:52.432 --> 03:07:59.594]  Who is an openly gay, male, half-Jewish, you know, but he's the enemy so they can't prop him up at all.
[03:07:59.634 --> 03:08:05.696]  So then they delete, I mean, all the attacks that we've done on them saying, what the heck are you thinking trying to normalize pedophilia?
[03:08:06.236 --> 03:08:08.256]  All of that, they never took that stuff down.
[03:08:08.516 --> 03:08:11.317]  They finally took it down so that they could bash my
[03:08:11.357 --> 03:08:12.138]  Because they're panicking.
[03:08:12.158 --> 03:08:12.939]  They didn't want to be called out.
[03:08:12.959 --> 03:08:20.887]  They want to brand the resistance as pedophile because I told everybody a month before the election and after I said they're going to start rounding pedophiles up.
[03:08:20.927 --> 03:08:22.169]  I was told that by high-level sources.
[03:08:22.549 --> 03:08:23.630]  I was told by NYPD.
[03:08:23.670 --> 03:08:23.891]  No.
[03:08:24.231 --> 03:08:25.613]  Wieners got child porn.
[03:08:25.653 --> 03:08:26.814]  It was in the news months after.
[03:08:27.034 --> 03:08:34.041]  I mean, I don't sit here and say, we have secret service sources and Hillary falls down every 30 minutes right now and has a brain tumor.
[03:08:34.302 --> 03:08:35.743]  Then we catch her on video a month later.
[03:08:35.964 --> 03:08:37.325]  You were there the week before she fell down.
[03:08:37.365 --> 03:08:38.807]  You caught her in the emergency deal.
[03:08:39.327 --> 03:08:42.470]  We don't just say we have secret service.
[03:08:42.871 --> 03:08:44.312]  We don't just say we have these sources.
[03:08:44.372 --> 03:08:46.214]  We don't just say we have sources about other pedophiles.
[03:08:46.515 --> 03:08:47.456]  We're reporting the truth.
[03:08:47.856 --> 03:08:48.697]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:08:48.817 --> 03:08:52.040]  And you know, we were there, we caught the ambulance leaving.
[03:08:52.060 --> 03:09:01.710]  It was pretty obvious to me with all the talk of her health concerns going on and noticing that she was already an hour late for her speaking event.
[03:09:01.770 --> 03:09:05.134]  And then for 45 minutes they have an ambulance and emergency workers in a tent.
[03:09:05.394 --> 03:09:08.517]  And then four days later, you come on, she falls down in New York.
[03:09:09.258 --> 03:09:13.700]  At the 9-11 memorial and the way the media spun it because they were... They wouldn't show her when she fell down.
[03:09:13.740 --> 03:09:14.761]  They said, oh, she stumbled.
[03:09:15.121 --> 03:09:16.281]  Look, it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:09:16.321 --> 03:09:17.142]  She didn't fall down.
[03:09:17.162 --> 03:09:19.503]  It would cut her falling on her freaking face.
[03:09:19.543 --> 03:09:21.204]  There's actually an article out there.
[03:09:21.264 --> 03:09:21.984]  I tweeted it out.
[03:09:22.224 --> 03:09:23.945]  Just like, wow, spin baby, spin.
[03:09:24.725 --> 03:09:29.449]  Saying, what a feat of strength she showed, what a strong woman she was.
[03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:36.396]  She was diagnosed with pneumonia and then she did all of these talks and she got a little overheated on the, on Sunday at the 9-11.
[03:09:36.576 --> 03:09:37.997]  I mean, a feat of strength.
[03:09:38.057 --> 03:09:40.339]  Oh my god, she can walk as a girl.
[03:09:40.619 --> 03:09:41.640]  She should be the president!
[03:09:42.381 --> 03:09:44.103]  Let's see what the number 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 on this live Wednesday Global Transmission.
[03:09:44.123 --> 03:09:45.885]  I just got mad yesterday when, you know, we brought in $3.3 million.
[03:09:45.905 --> 03:09:46.506]  Sounds like a lot.
[03:09:46.526 --> 03:09:47.327]  Reporters, crew, infrastructure.
[03:09:47.367 --> 03:09:48.288]  It ain't what it used to be.
[03:10:01.983 --> 03:10:05.446]  Alex, you did all of this without Google, okay?
[03:10:05.646 --> 03:10:20.679]  So, they think that they're going to take you out by knocking down one of your supply channels, and yes, it's definitely going to be a devastating hit, but the thing is that you have listeners supporting you, you have a global
[03:10:21.139 --> 03:10:21.780]  No, I agree.
[03:10:21.880 --> 03:10:25.145]  They just have to say, instead of buying something once a month, buy it twice a month.
[03:10:25.185 --> 03:10:26.607]  If they do that, the problems are all solved.
[03:10:26.627 --> 03:10:28.350]  But, I mean, these are great products.
[03:10:28.410 --> 03:10:29.752]  Anyways, you've taken Super Female.
[03:10:29.792 --> 03:10:30.893]  You guys have taken X2.
[03:10:31.134 --> 03:10:32.095]  The water filters are great.
[03:10:32.436 --> 03:10:33.477]  Everybody needs this stuff.
[03:10:33.497 --> 03:10:34.659]  It's infowarestore.com.
[03:10:34.999 --> 03:10:35.500]  But, you know.
[03:10:36.241 --> 03:10:41.524]  I've got the money so far for, you know, part of this year, then I get worried because they're attacking us on every front.
[03:10:41.544 --> 03:10:42.685]  Then I think, can I expand?
[03:10:42.765 --> 03:10:43.445]  I want to.
[03:10:43.865 --> 03:10:48.948]  I'm going to do it, but we need everybody to buy the products at InfoWareStore.com so you see more reporters.
[03:10:48.988 --> 03:10:51.629]  Yeah, and they are great products.
[03:10:51.649 --> 03:10:52.150]  That's the thing.
[03:10:52.170 --> 03:10:56.492]  We're not just trying to push products that are no good just to fund an operation.
[03:10:56.772 --> 03:10:59.894]  No, these are really good products, and even before I was even
[03:11:00.274 --> 03:11:08.297]  Working with InfoWars, I was always telling my friends, my female lady friends especially, get the iodine, get the iodine X2.
[03:11:08.317 --> 03:11:10.958]  I used it, it changed my life.
[03:11:11.018 --> 03:11:13.178]  Oh my god, women are so deficient, so are men.
[03:11:13.358 --> 03:11:13.538]  Exactly.
[03:11:13.558 --> 03:11:15.239]  Just the fertility info that I don't...
[03:11:15.619 --> 03:11:23.424]  I had horrible, I know this is kind of personal information, I had the most horrible period cramps you could ever imagine.
[03:11:23.464 --> 03:11:26.826]  I was having so many problems in that, you know, that category.
[03:11:26.846 --> 03:11:27.667]  That's caused by deficiency.
[03:11:27.707 --> 03:11:28.948]  It was absolutely horrible.
[03:11:29.028 --> 03:11:32.450]  I was doubled over in pain to where I was like throwing up in so much pain.
[03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:38.914]  And I kid you not, I started taking the iodine and I immediately started noticing, like the next couple months.
[03:11:38.934 --> 03:11:39.575]  I remember hippies!
[03:11:39.595 --> 03:11:40.896]  Literally, everything got better.
[03:11:40.916 --> 03:11:41.076]  Wow.
[03:11:41.496 --> 03:11:52.359]  When I was a kid at Martin Springs, I didn't live here, but we'd come visit, the super swimmer hippies that were swimming laps all had like bottles of, jugs of water with iodine.
[03:11:52.379 --> 03:11:56.861]  And I was like, oh, iodine's the key, it's the good halogen, it's the life, you know, all this stuff.
[03:11:56.881 --> 03:11:59.822]  And I talked to a group, he said, yeah, but everybody's got the iodine that's bound.
[03:12:00.222 --> 03:12:02.363]  This is the good halogen that blocks the fluoride, everything.
[03:12:02.743 --> 03:12:07.364]  And I forget to take it all the time, but man, when I do take it for a month straight, it's incredible.
[03:12:07.784 --> 03:12:09.985]  And again, it's the good halogen.
[03:12:10.465 --> 03:12:11.806]  Women have all these thyroid problems.
[03:12:11.826 --> 03:12:13.068]  In fact, I didn't even know this about you, Millie.
[03:12:13.108 --> 03:12:13.748]  I didn't know this.
[03:12:13.968 --> 03:12:17.131]  I just knew women that have issues because they don't have a basic building block.
[03:12:17.171 --> 03:12:19.894]  You die like vitamin C. You die without iodine.
[03:12:19.934 --> 03:12:21.475]  Tell folks what happened.
[03:12:21.555 --> 03:12:25.799]  Well, my mom grew up, she was raised in the Goiter Belt.
[03:12:25.879 --> 03:12:32.365]  And you know, in the soil in these areas, in the Goiter Belt, if you look it up, they don't have iodine naturally.
[03:12:32.666 --> 03:12:34.588]  Yes, they do not have iodine there.
[03:12:34.608 --> 03:12:36.069]  That's why they added it to salt for a while.
[03:12:36.369 --> 03:12:36.789]  Exactly.
[03:12:36.849 --> 03:12:42.691]  So my mom, you know, likes to say that she's like second or third generation iodine deficient.
[03:12:42.911 --> 03:12:44.572]  So it wasn't only me.
[03:12:44.652 --> 03:12:47.133]  I mean, my aunts have a plethora of health issues.
[03:12:47.173 --> 03:12:48.073]  Hey guys, Google IQ.
[03:12:48.193 --> 03:12:50.154]  IQ went up 15 points Midwest after iodine.
[03:12:50.174 --> 03:12:50.554]  Go ahead.
[03:12:50.574 --> 03:12:50.674]  Sorry.
[03:12:50.954 --> 03:12:51.154]  Yeah.
[03:12:51.454 --> 03:12:56.599]  You know, my aunts had all these different health problems, and they're all iodine deficient.
[03:12:56.619 --> 03:12:57.920]  My mom was having health problems.
[03:12:57.940 --> 03:12:58.601]  Well, let's just say it.
[03:12:58.841 --> 03:13:03.145]  You have these beautiful women in the Midwest, and when they don't have it, the same thing happens in China.
[03:13:03.165 --> 03:13:06.268]  They blow up because their body's looking for it.
[03:13:06.308 --> 03:13:14.336]  Their thyroids go out, and these beautiful supermodels, they end up by 40 or 50 looking just totally like Frankenstein because they don't have it.
[03:13:14.796 --> 03:13:20.138]  Exactly and if you look at my mom and she seriously she tells everyone she knows about iodine.
[03:13:20.259 --> 03:13:23.040]  I kid you not she's like she's the iodine lady okay.
[03:13:23.440 --> 03:13:36.606]  After I showed her about iodine because she was she was sick you know she was not feeling good and she has you know arthritis and all these other problems and that were literally slowing her down and she started taking that nascent iodine and
[03:13:36.866 --> 03:13:46.132]  And I kid you not, she's like full of energy, she runs around, she feels like, you know, it made her look younger, she lost some weight, and she literally looks so young.
[03:13:46.532 --> 03:13:50.515]  People do not believe her when they see me and her together, that she's my mom.
[03:13:50.535 --> 03:13:51.816]  They're like, there's no way, you're sisters!
[03:13:51.836 --> 03:14:02.863]  Because women, because, let's just say it, now that the site is gone, because women release a lot of their chemicals and iron and stuff every month, they're even more hit by not having iodine, and so,
[03:14:03.803 --> 03:14:06.545]  Imagine, you know this, it's just like we changed the world electing Trump.
[03:14:06.685 --> 03:14:07.705]  Infowars has the keys.
[03:14:08.246 --> 03:14:09.286]  It's hidden in plain view.
[03:14:09.306 --> 03:14:11.187]  Guys, Google it.
[03:14:11.247 --> 03:14:11.968]  Ladies, Google it.
[03:14:12.008 --> 03:14:13.168]  You can pull it.
[03:14:13.188 --> 03:14:15.970]  IQs increased after I and I. It's so true.
[03:14:16.010 --> 03:14:17.030]  There it is.
[03:14:17.050 --> 03:14:17.471]  15 points.
[03:14:17.951 --> 03:14:18.631]  Business Insider.
[03:14:18.651 --> 03:14:19.672]  That's government studies.
[03:14:19.692 --> 03:14:23.834]  Because there was so much brain damage and so much deformity in the Midwest because the soil didn't have it.
[03:14:24.074 --> 03:14:24.555]  Exactly.
[03:14:24.635 --> 03:14:27.036]  That once they did it, it just exploded.
[03:14:27.296 --> 03:14:30.839]  And ADD is pretty prevalent in my family, unfortunately.
[03:14:30.859 --> 03:14:31.960]  Oh my god, I get high off iodine.
[03:14:32.280 --> 03:14:35.322]  And the iodine actually helps me with ADD.
[03:14:35.463 --> 03:14:36.844]  And what's crazy is this.
[03:14:36.924 --> 03:14:37.604]  I want some right now.
[03:14:37.664 --> 03:14:38.505]  I know, I was just about to say.
[03:14:38.525 --> 03:14:39.286]  Bring in the next two.
[03:14:39.346 --> 03:14:40.206]  I'm not kidding, though.
[03:14:40.226 --> 03:14:42.428]  Will you please give it to me?
[03:14:42.508 --> 03:14:46.771]  And we didn't just get the seaweed base, which is balanced, so you don't absorb it.
[03:14:47.052 --> 03:14:48.313]  We have the crystal source.
[03:14:48.353 --> 03:14:49.453]  We have the DEA.
[03:14:50.174 --> 03:14:53.998]  Big labs, you have to get it made, it like eats holes through concrete, it's so strong.
[03:14:54.038 --> 03:14:57.482]  They put it into gas form, they inject it into palm oil.
[03:14:57.502 --> 03:15:08.593]  I mean... I remember you actually had me do, and we never used that footage from what I can recall, that where we were actually showing just your typical iodine, what you would maybe just see in a store, and then a better quality.
[03:15:08.673 --> 03:15:11.536]  It's red and ours turns blue, because that's the color of the crystals.
[03:15:11.616 --> 03:15:29.891]  We would hold it up like this and it was so thick that it didn't even... Well listen, I'm not some beach boy, but I quit working out, got depressed about the New World Order, I gained almost, I gained 99 pounds, from like 185 pounds to 280 pounds, I gained all this weight, and I was swimming two miles some lifting weights, I couldn't lose more than 20 pounds.
[03:15:30.351 --> 03:15:37.437]  I went on iodine, I'm gonna tell you something right now, I went on iodine four years ago, real iodine, and I lost another 30 pounds, and you know,
[03:15:37.757 --> 03:15:38.697]  I'm a big stocky guy.
[03:15:38.737 --> 03:15:41.938]  If I take my clothes off here, I mean, I look like I'm ready to, you know, kill some people.
[03:15:41.998 --> 03:15:43.119]  Talk me into it, Millie.
[03:15:43.139 --> 03:15:44.039]  There we go.
[03:15:44.079 --> 03:15:45.899]  The point is, is that it's real.
[03:15:46.440 --> 03:15:51.241]  I mean, it's like it's all... and the hippies, the good liberals used to be against war.
[03:15:51.321 --> 03:15:52.241]  They knew about this.
[03:15:53.082 --> 03:15:56.563]  You buy stuff at the local thing, that's all bound, it'll eat a hole in your gut.
[03:15:56.923 --> 03:15:57.903]  This is real iodine.
[03:15:58.379 --> 03:16:04.184]  Yeah, exactly, and you know it's pretty crazy, and this is just my own personal experience and what I chose to do.
[03:16:04.204 --> 03:16:20.818]  I'm not necessarily advocating this for anybody else, but I trust the InfoWars products so much that I took the nascent iodine and a bunch of, you know, the B12 and a bunch of different InfoWars products while I was pregnant, and I kid you not, my son is extremely intelligent.
[03:16:20.838 --> 03:16:23.220]  And I'm not just saying that because I'm his mom, okay?
[03:16:23.820 --> 03:16:25.141]  This kid's not even two years old.
[03:16:25.221 --> 03:16:27.143]  If you don't have iodine... He knows his alphabet.
[03:16:27.183 --> 03:16:28.244]  He can count to 20.
[03:16:28.584 --> 03:16:29.805]  He knows all of his shapes.
[03:16:29.825 --> 03:16:32.607]  The difference between an oval and a circle and a semi-circle.
[03:16:32.667 --> 03:16:33.948]  He's not even two years old.
[03:16:34.068 --> 03:16:35.410]  And Maxine Waters doesn't know that.
[03:16:35.430 --> 03:16:35.970]  No, exactly.
[03:16:35.990 --> 03:16:36.871]  He knows his colors.
[03:16:36.931 --> 03:16:43.556]  I mean, this child is very smart and I feel like, wow, what would my potential have been if I had iodine when I was in the womb?
[03:16:43.856 --> 03:16:46.098]  Just really bright and curious, but well-behaved.
[03:16:46.138 --> 03:16:46.398]  By the way...
[03:16:47.119 --> 03:16:49.021]  I mean, I already knew this, and I'm not trying to be weird.
[03:16:49.381 --> 03:16:53.024]  I remember, like, five years ago, Dr. Grip had already had on as a guest, and they were at a big clinic.
[03:16:53.044 --> 03:16:53.905]  It was a top producer.
[03:16:53.965 --> 03:16:55.306]  He said, Audon.
[03:16:55.366 --> 03:16:55.907]  I'm not making fun of him.
[03:16:56.087 --> 03:16:57.348]  Audon's the key, Alex.
[03:16:57.388 --> 03:16:57.969]  Good halogen.
[03:16:58.369 --> 03:16:59.990]  We have it from this source.
[03:17:00.191 --> 03:17:03.153]  And I was like, we want to give you this product.
[03:17:03.233 --> 03:17:03.894]  It's a purist.
[03:17:06.696 --> 03:17:08.198]  And then, all of a sudden, I started taking it.
[03:17:08.908 --> 03:17:09.569]  It's like zing!
[03:17:09.749 --> 03:17:14.814]  Well then, I gotta be honest, like a month into it, he said, watch out, you go through this toxicity effect.
[03:17:15.434 --> 03:17:16.415]  I suddenly couldn't sleep.
[03:17:17.196 --> 03:17:24.303]  All this pore, it was like just after a hot shower, you know, just all this oil came out and other stuff and I was like, whoa!
[03:17:25.203 --> 03:17:25.884]  Detoxing.
[03:17:26.064 --> 03:17:29.548]  I like it, like you're carrying a kid on your shoulders, when you take him off, it feels like you're flying.
[03:17:29.568 --> 03:17:30.929]  Yeah.
[03:17:31.009 --> 03:17:32.871]  After three weeks on it, that's what I felt like.
[03:17:33.516 --> 03:17:34.337]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:17:34.397 --> 03:17:40.801]  I mean, I remember the first time I took it, I almost felt like I got a little bit of like a head high or a rush or something.
[03:17:41.422 --> 03:17:44.084]  Well, the pineal runs off of it.
[03:17:44.144 --> 03:17:45.385]  I mean, that's it.
[03:17:45.425 --> 03:17:46.606]  And see, what's the bad halogen?
[03:17:46.986 --> 03:17:52.650]  Bromine, fluoride, chlorine, all this other crap that literally calcifies your pineal.
[03:17:52.770 --> 03:17:54.811]  And that goes back to... And this isn't New Age stuff.
[03:17:54.912 --> 03:17:55.852]  It's a fact.
[03:17:56.072 --> 03:17:58.934]  And that goes back to what we were talking about earlier with
[03:17:59.875 --> 03:18:00.275]  Spiritual.
[03:18:00.435 --> 03:18:01.496]  Yes, it's the dark.
[03:18:01.536 --> 03:18:08.339]  Let me warn folks though, if you've got a really infected thyroid and pineal and stuff, we've had people that are like, it's all jambled up.
[03:18:08.359 --> 03:18:09.440]  They're spiritually clogged.
[03:18:09.660 --> 03:18:13.562]  Stuff will come out once that's, you know, physically it'll like be dumping out.
[03:18:13.622 --> 03:18:14.943]  So there's a detox.
[03:18:15.483 --> 03:18:16.304]  Consult a physician.
[03:18:16.584 --> 03:18:16.764]  Yes.
[03:18:17.722 --> 03:18:18.123]  Exactly.
[03:18:18.943 --> 03:18:20.445]  We're talking about like oxygen.
[03:18:21.025 --> 03:18:22.387]  If we don't have oxygen, we die.
[03:18:22.407 --> 03:18:23.368]  If we don't have iodine, we die.
[03:18:23.508 --> 03:18:24.989]  Yeah, it's essential.
[03:18:25.049 --> 03:18:26.571]  It is really and truly essential.
[03:18:26.591 --> 03:18:28.253]  And it's our soil is so depleted.
[03:18:28.273 --> 03:18:37.482]  So even if you are eating healthy and eating vegetables, even organic, the soil itself is so depleted of nutrients that we truly are all depleted in this country.
[03:18:37.822 --> 03:18:44.726]  Yeah, I mean, it's so depleted, and that's why, you know, it's important to have mineral supplements in your diet as well.
[03:18:45.166 --> 03:18:47.147]  Because you're not getting it.
[03:18:47.427 --> 03:18:52.430]  When I religiously do it, it's great, and I'm always kind of like, so much, I kind of forget.
[03:18:52.450 --> 03:18:54.732]  And then I'm like, oh, then it stops working.
[03:18:55.312 --> 03:18:55.612]  Yeah.
[03:18:56.212 --> 03:18:59.574]  Well, because I think you have to remember, you know, it's a buildup.
[03:18:59.815 --> 03:19:04.897]  We're an onslaught every single day from our lives, just the traffic, the weather.
[03:19:04.937 --> 03:19:05.778]  Oh my God, the traffic.
[03:19:07.339 --> 03:19:08.400]  I had to get a haircut today.
[03:19:08.561 --> 03:19:13.586]  It took me, at 3 o'clock, 50 minutes to go, like, 12 miles away.
[03:19:13.606 --> 03:19:18.852]  And then I had to go to other meetings and come back and I was just like... This is the new Austin, Texas.
[03:19:18.892 --> 03:19:19.833]  Oh my god, it's the worst.
[03:19:19.853 --> 03:19:22.395]  I love Austin, I love Texas, but it is a hellhole.
[03:19:22.576 --> 03:19:22.956]  Yeah.
[03:19:23.917 --> 03:19:25.439]  You better live close to the office and I don't.
[03:19:25.865 --> 03:19:31.231]  Just make sure you vote so we don't get the creepy Californians ruling us here in 2018.
[03:19:31.271 --> 03:19:34.374]  I love how they leave their own collapsing state.
[03:19:35.075 --> 03:19:43.103]  Seriously, I hate going on air and saying, I see the comments, hey, we made $3.3 million last year in 2016 on this.
[03:19:43.283 --> 03:19:44.805]  It was scheduled to make $5 million.
[03:19:45.145 --> 03:19:48.409]  We've been doing it three years, like a million, two million, three million, you know, five million.
[03:19:50.006 --> 03:19:51.710]  And they just go, sorry, you're fake news.
[03:19:52.172 --> 03:19:52.953]  You can't do this.
[03:19:53.034 --> 03:19:54.076]  Oh, just do something else.
[03:19:54.116 --> 03:19:57.705]  Well, I mean, we're selling our products, paying Google.
[03:19:59.244 --> 03:20:02.087]  You know, for three million dollars, you're paying them like a million dollars.
[03:20:02.127 --> 03:20:06.010]  We're trying to just pay for stuff, and then that three million isn't profit.
[03:20:06.030 --> 03:20:06.851]  You gotta pay for the product.
[03:20:07.231 --> 03:20:11.295]  I mean, I'm bitching, because we're, you know, we're really good at reaching crowds of people.
[03:20:11.595 --> 03:20:14.278]  I'm not that good at making money, but compared to a lot of people, I guess I am.
[03:20:14.298 --> 03:20:15.218]  Most media's going bankrupt.
[03:20:15.819 --> 03:20:20.163]  It's just like, we're changing the world, and then now I learned today, it's not just us.
[03:20:20.203 --> 03:20:22.045]  It's all the conservative, and they're not conservative.
[03:20:22.065 --> 03:20:22.885]  They call it conservative.
[03:20:23.346 --> 03:20:24.487]  Breitbart's not conservative.
[03:20:24.507 --> 03:20:25.428]  Run by Bannon, a big...
[03:20:25.928 --> 03:20:27.530]  He's a liberal, wants to cut your taxes.
[03:20:27.550 --> 03:20:28.651]  He's a real liberal.
[03:20:28.992 --> 03:20:30.634]  And so they're after us.
[03:20:30.674 --> 03:20:32.376]  So we've got products you need.
[03:20:32.776 --> 03:20:34.418]  Sign up for auto-ship at 10% off.
[03:20:34.899 --> 03:20:35.980]  I just want to beat them.
[03:20:36.301 --> 03:20:38.283]  I, you know, I felt bad three years ago.
[03:20:38.303 --> 03:20:39.404]  You know, Anthony's a smart guy.
[03:20:39.424 --> 03:20:40.986]  He goes, hey, you got to do this ad roll.
[03:20:41.747 --> 03:20:44.428]  And this Google thing and we'll do this targeting advertising.
[03:20:44.889 --> 03:20:45.649]  That's what Anthony does.
[03:20:45.689 --> 03:20:46.429]  He just helps us.
[03:20:46.489 --> 03:20:47.210]  He's done so much.
[03:20:47.810 --> 03:20:49.551]  And I said, OK, but I don't trust Google.
[03:20:49.791 --> 03:20:50.271]  We did it.
[03:20:50.691 --> 03:20:51.632]  And then now here we are.
[03:20:52.112 --> 03:20:53.873]  Three years later, they just kicked us off of it.
[03:20:53.913 --> 03:20:54.853]  And now I'm dependent on it.
[03:20:55.033 --> 03:20:56.374]  I'm not bitching about Anthony.
[03:20:56.714 --> 03:20:57.374]  I'm just saying.
[03:20:57.394 --> 03:20:58.495]  Go ahead.
[03:20:58.680 --> 03:21:04.483]  Well, that's what they do, and that's how Facebook has dominated, because they get everyone hooked into their system.
[03:21:04.503 --> 03:21:10.326]  Yeah, but that sounds big to the audience, when you've got 60 people in a building, and bandwidth is millions every quarter.
[03:21:10.346 --> 03:21:13.768]  The bandwidth of servers, my goodness, who could put up with that?
[03:21:13.928 --> 03:21:18.070]  They want us to take them on, they want us to reach millions a week on our own platforms.
[03:21:19.714 --> 03:21:21.415]  You have any idea what this costs, folks?
[03:21:21.455 --> 03:21:23.036]  Just the legal alone.
[03:21:23.056 --> 03:21:23.896]  Exactly.
[03:21:23.936 --> 03:21:27.138]  The copyrights, the frickin' licenses.
[03:21:27.618 --> 03:21:32.161]  You know, we like pay, just getting images, just to have images on the website.
[03:21:32.561 --> 03:21:35.783]  You know, because we try to go do commons free, and then everybody sues you.
[03:21:35.843 --> 03:21:37.844]  So, okay, I pay Getty all this money.
[03:21:37.864 --> 03:21:39.805]  You know, it's like, I'm just, I'm not bitching.
[03:21:40.285 --> 03:21:43.367]  I'm just saying, there's a lot of money here getting scrapped.
[03:21:43.647 --> 03:21:56.720]  Just to put it in perspective of how, you know, appreciative we are at this job, I mean, any other person graduating with a journalism degree, you're basically told you're gonna go, you're gonna get paid like maybe $18,000 a year, you're gonna work more than 40 hours a week, 40 to 60 hours a week.
[03:22:00.083 --> 03:22:03.427]  You're going to make more money working at McDonald's than you are.
[03:22:03.467 --> 03:22:05.669]  But I pay people good because I want you focused on fighting the tyranny.
[03:22:05.689 --> 03:22:06.770]  You actually pay us a living wage.
[03:22:06.870 --> 03:22:07.431]  Exactly.
[03:22:07.571 --> 03:22:10.114]  It's, I mean, I just can't, people don't understand.
[03:22:10.354 --> 03:22:11.856]  You're such an amazing boss.
[03:22:11.876 --> 03:22:12.276]  Well, it's not that.
[03:22:12.296 --> 03:22:14.578]  Everything you do... Leigh-Anne, I can't treat you like...
[03:22:15.299 --> 03:22:16.160]  Like, I don't want to be treated.
[03:22:16.401 --> 03:22:17.001]  I love everybody.
[03:22:17.021 --> 03:22:17.542]  You understand that?
[03:22:17.562 --> 03:22:17.943]  Yeah, no.
[03:22:18.083 --> 03:22:19.104]  I can't treat people.
[03:22:19.485 --> 03:22:21.167]  That's what pains me, is we were winning.
[03:22:21.467 --> 03:22:21.868]  They're coming.
[03:22:21.888 --> 03:22:23.029]  I don't want to hurt everybody.
[03:22:23.149 --> 03:22:24.631]  I just, I'm not bitching about it.
[03:22:24.651 --> 03:22:25.953]  I just, they're such dickheads.
[03:22:26.253 --> 03:22:30.139]  Because we literally go out and sell good products, water filters to people.
[03:22:30.439 --> 03:22:31.000]  That's what they ban.
[03:22:31.340 --> 03:22:31.440]  Yeah.
[03:22:31.460 --> 03:22:32.401]  And they're not going to let me.
[03:22:32.421 --> 03:22:33.361]  They're not going to let me.
[03:22:33.401 --> 03:22:36.884]  They should be like, you know, Google and AdRoll ban water filter ads.
[03:22:36.944 --> 03:22:40.066]  Notice they don't ever try to cut or ban the funding.
[03:22:40.206 --> 03:22:41.687]  I mean, on television.
[03:22:41.827 --> 03:22:45.930]  I didn't have a water filter sponsor for three years because we couldn't find one that was premium.
[03:22:46.210 --> 03:22:46.410]  Right.
[03:22:46.490 --> 03:22:46.730]  Yeah.
[03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:50.813]  People come to you all the time with products and say, please, you know, back this.
[03:22:50.933 --> 03:22:52.474]  I want to put this on your site or whatever.
[03:22:52.594 --> 03:22:53.775]  And it's not that we're that good.
[03:22:53.855 --> 03:22:57.177]  It's that I can't treat somebody like I'm not going to be treated.
[03:22:57.478 --> 03:23:01.120]  And the psychos look at us and think we're weak because we're not really to screw people.
[03:23:01.360 --> 03:23:06.645]  Well, Big Pharma probably hates the products that we're selling because we're cutting into their business.
[03:23:06.925 --> 03:23:08.987]  They profit off of people being sick.
[03:23:09.287 --> 03:23:12.509]  They profit off of people dying and going to the hospital all the time.
[03:23:12.810 --> 03:23:14.091]  So yeah, Big Pharma hates it.
[03:23:14.371 --> 03:23:16.753]  And who mainly funds the mainstream media?
[03:23:16.793 --> 03:23:21.137]  I know that Big Pharma is a huge funder of the mainstream media.
[03:23:21.157 --> 03:23:22.238]  Well, let me tell you about Corsi.
[03:23:22.258 --> 03:23:24.640]  Corsi worked for the State Department in clandestine operations.
[03:23:25.020 --> 03:23:27.122]  He was a Harvard graduate, big, big banker guy.
[03:23:27.142 --> 03:23:29.244]  This guy calls me
[03:23:30.407 --> 03:23:33.509]  You know, and this isn't, the government's listening, this isn't FISA courts I'm being listened to.
[03:23:33.529 --> 03:23:36.611]  And I mean, it's like the former head of Homeland Security in Congress.
[03:23:36.691 --> 03:23:38.352]  It's the former head of the Armed Services Committee.
[03:23:38.372 --> 03:23:40.314]  It's, it's got, it's all these people.
[03:23:40.854 --> 03:23:44.096]  And they're like all pissed, hoping I'm going to beat the new world order.
[03:23:44.116 --> 03:23:46.418]  Like, the government we say is the enemy.
[03:23:46.518 --> 03:23:51.041]  No, they're all these good people that never had a media to tell the truth, and they're ready.
[03:23:51.101 --> 03:23:52.542]  And that's why this is so special.
[03:23:52.602 --> 03:23:55.944]  That's why they're leaking that stuff to James O'Keefe, that he's supposed to drop.
[03:23:55.984 --> 03:23:56.484]  Exactly.
[03:23:56.524 --> 03:24:09.410]  Because it's the people on the inside who see what's going on, and that's why I'm just curious to see the people who are there working with the CIA and these other agencies who aren't corrupt, and they're seeing what's happening to the president.
[03:24:09.430 --> 03:24:10.431]  And that's key.
[03:24:10.451 --> 03:24:11.632]  They weren't perfect.
[03:24:11.672 --> 03:24:12.992]  They could see injustice.
[03:24:13.092 --> 03:24:14.533]  The elite are so evil now.
[03:24:15.254 --> 03:24:20.980]  They set up an NSA spy grid, even though it then exposed the stuff they were doing with their own killers.
[03:24:21.060 --> 03:24:27.087]  People that have killed hundreds of people in some cases, flipped out so bad by the evil, because they killed people they were fighting.
[03:24:27.648 --> 03:24:28.809]  They weren't killing kids.
[03:24:29.710 --> 03:24:30.790]  So that's why they're screwed.
[03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:36.232]  That's why they want computers and robots and stuff that'll take orders because they're so scared of their own people.
[03:24:36.452 --> 03:24:43.915]  And the media that will cover up for them when their dirt is exposed via this big surveillance grid that they have, like Podesta.
[03:24:44.395 --> 03:24:47.196]  The mainstream media debunked all of that stuff right away.
[03:24:47.276 --> 03:24:49.876]  Like, okay, so the MSM looked at it.
[03:24:52.438 --> 03:24:59.405]  Like Mika Zubrinsky, who went on there saying, we're the ones who are supposed to control what the people think.
[03:24:59.445 --> 03:25:04.431]  We're the ones who do the programming and tell the American people what to think, not Donald Trump, not InfoWars.
[03:25:04.471 --> 03:25:06.573]  Why do you think they're just normalizing it?
[03:25:06.593 --> 03:25:10.898]  I mean, why are they just admitting, okay, we want to kill you, okay, we lied to you?
[03:25:10.998 --> 03:25:11.638]  Because it's totally 1984.
[03:25:12.018 --> 03:25:13.019]  It's here.
[03:25:13.039 --> 03:25:14.480]  They co-opted it.
[03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:27.505]  They know that they have a good portion of the American public so entranced, so brainwashed, so in their mind control program, that literally they know that they can be bold and say it.
[03:25:27.886 --> 03:25:30.067]  Because they know that they have an army of zombies.
[03:25:30.087 --> 03:25:32.788]  They can literally tell you what they're doing.
[03:25:33.308 --> 03:25:35.891]  And then they've trained you that it's the exact opposite.
[03:25:36.031 --> 03:25:39.494]  Or you're looking at a picture on the TV screen and they're telling you it's complete.
[03:25:39.995 --> 03:25:41.876]  The gas lighting, it is double speak.
[03:25:41.936 --> 03:25:43.418]  It's the new speak, it's inside.
[03:25:43.438 --> 03:25:51.446]  Well it's once they get it over, almost all cultures, whether white, Hispanic, whatever it is, once they get you, they've got you.
[03:25:51.466 --> 03:25:52.307]  And it's like somehow
[03:25:53.027 --> 03:25:55.648]  Europe was totally dominated, evil, corrupt for thousands of years.
[03:25:55.728 --> 03:25:57.449]  It kind of just got this oxygen for a minute.
[03:25:57.789 --> 03:26:01.131]  You go to Latin America, the Hispanics down there, they're like psychic.
[03:26:01.171 --> 03:26:01.971]  They're dialed in.
[03:26:02.051 --> 03:26:03.632]  They know stuff you're not even saying.
[03:26:04.092 --> 03:26:08.134]  They know everything, but they're like suppressed in the system playing along.
[03:26:08.614 --> 03:26:09.454]  And that's what I'm saying.
[03:26:09.514 --> 03:26:10.595]  I want to see them break out.
[03:26:10.975 --> 03:26:16.398]  By the way, we have people that are like hounding us to translate all of our articles.
[03:26:16.438 --> 03:26:16.978]  I don't have the money!
[03:26:17.518 --> 03:26:18.498]  They want to do it for free.
[03:26:18.558 --> 03:26:19.119]  No, I agree.
[03:26:19.219 --> 03:26:21.760]  I'm about to make that connection.
[03:26:21.780 --> 03:26:22.680]  Leigh Ann, let's just do it.
[03:26:22.740 --> 03:26:23.180]  I need your help.
[03:26:23.200 --> 03:26:24.541]  Are we going to take any phone calls?
[03:26:24.561 --> 03:26:25.541]  We're going to take phone calls.
[03:26:25.701 --> 03:26:27.362]  Melody wants to praise Alex.
[03:26:27.742 --> 03:26:29.503]  Oh, I don't want to be praised anymore.
[03:26:29.683 --> 03:26:30.463]  We got Stephen.
[03:26:30.643 --> 03:26:31.904]  We got Don't Take.
[03:26:32.484 --> 03:26:33.404]  I'm going to take that for sure.
[03:26:33.825 --> 03:26:34.645]  We got Sam.
[03:26:34.685 --> 03:26:36.946]  We got Melody.
[03:26:37.446 --> 03:26:38.426]  We got Niles.
[03:26:38.466 --> 03:26:39.947]  We got Andrea.
[03:26:39.987 --> 03:26:40.707]  We got Pam.
[03:26:41.227 --> 03:26:41.948]  We got Terry.
[03:26:41.968 --> 03:26:42.588]  We got everybody.
[03:26:42.668 --> 03:26:43.789]  I want to take the ones that say Don't Take.
[03:26:43.809 --> 03:26:44.849]  Robert David Steele.
[03:26:45.009 --> 03:26:47.271]  They're like going to accuse me of being a... You know, here's the thing.
[03:26:47.611 --> 03:26:50.273]  I kind of wish sometimes the CIA was giving me orders.
[03:26:52.135 --> 03:26:53.296]  Because then you'd know what to do?
[03:26:53.356 --> 03:26:53.796]  Or what do you mean?
[03:26:53.816 --> 03:26:54.797]  No, they don't know what to do.
[03:26:54.817 --> 03:26:55.798]  They're a bunch of idiots.
[03:26:55.858 --> 03:26:58.640]  It's like, oh my God, I'm with a big corrupt group.
[03:26:58.660 --> 03:27:00.001]  They're like... Oh, because it'd be easy.
[03:27:00.041 --> 03:27:01.963]  Because then you'd just be mainstream media.
[03:27:02.003 --> 03:27:06.687]  You could just read off... You know, the only family I knew that did stuff for the CIA said, you're on target.
[03:27:06.747 --> 03:27:07.227]  It's evil.
[03:27:07.307 --> 03:27:07.747]  Fight them.
[03:27:08.708 --> 03:27:11.751]  It wasn't like, you know, it wasn't like, oh, let's go join with it.
[03:27:11.791 --> 03:27:12.912]  It's like, they're soulless.
[03:27:12.932 --> 03:27:13.692]  They use you.
[03:27:13.752 --> 03:27:14.553]  It's horrible things.
[03:27:14.633 --> 03:27:21.410]  Well it is like the Captain America movie, when we all went to review, I think it was the second one that came out, and that's what it was, that they were...
[03:27:22.970 --> 03:27:27.033]  They discovered that it was the higher-ups that were doing evil.
[03:27:27.714 --> 03:27:34.379]  If you notice, the main thing that they use as a strategy is character assassination.
[03:27:34.759 --> 03:27:37.441]  And if you notice, what did they use to take out Flynn?
[03:27:37.882 --> 03:27:39.623]  In a sense, it was character assassination.
[03:27:39.663 --> 03:27:45.427]  Because if the American people said, we don't really care about some conversations, so what?
[03:27:45.487 --> 03:27:48.029]  He should be trying to remove these saints.
[03:27:48.450 --> 03:27:49.811]  Then it wouldn't be a big deal.
[03:27:50.191 --> 03:27:55.874]  They would show him show up to a meeting early and be getting his things ready and not not being arrogant.
[03:27:56.055 --> 03:27:56.275]  Yeah.
[03:27:56.355 --> 03:27:59.136]  Look how look how awkward he looks.
[03:27:59.497 --> 03:28:00.677]  He's there 30 minutes early.
[03:28:00.958 --> 03:28:01.118]  Yeah.
[03:28:01.158 --> 03:28:03.159]  He didn't care and there's no entourage around him.
[03:28:03.499 --> 03:28:04.680]  He's sitting down getting ready.
[03:28:05.040 --> 03:28:05.941]  He was like focus.
[03:28:05.981 --> 03:28:08.642]  So it's like he's not an arrogant narcissist.
[03:28:09.082 --> 03:28:09.803]  We can't have him.
[03:28:09.963 --> 03:28:15.626]  They used character assassination to take down people on Trump's side, like Milo Yiannopoulos.
[03:28:15.666 --> 03:28:17.446]  I'm not going to say it, they had a database.
[03:28:17.486 --> 03:28:19.567]  They knew Flynn, listened to the show.
[03:28:19.587 --> 03:28:20.888]  They knew he was tweeting.
[03:28:20.988 --> 03:28:21.408]  It was Flynn.
[03:28:21.428 --> 03:28:22.629]  Flynn told Trump how great I was.
[03:28:30.012 --> 03:28:31.634]  And so that's exactly it.
[03:28:31.674 --> 03:28:35.658]  They're using the character assassinations to take out the people on Trump's side.
[03:28:35.698 --> 03:28:45.167]  But at the same time, if it weren't Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton had so many things come out on her, and it didn't matter how much character assassination would have been out there.
[03:28:45.587 --> 03:28:46.408]  Nothing stuck.
[03:28:46.528 --> 03:28:47.429]  Nothing happened.
[03:28:47.469 --> 03:28:48.290]  She's still there.
[03:28:48.530 --> 03:28:51.352]  Who was the head of defense intelligence like six years ago, start listening.
[03:28:51.372 --> 03:28:54.955]  Because he's there hearing what we're saying on air, and that's what's real.
[03:28:55.256 --> 03:28:56.697]  They were like investigating us.
[03:28:56.777 --> 03:28:59.299]  They had the military watching us.
[03:28:59.639 --> 03:29:01.340]  How does Alex Jones know all this?
[03:29:01.381 --> 03:29:01.741]  Yeah.
[03:29:01.761 --> 03:29:02.742]  Tell people big secrets.
[03:29:02.762 --> 03:29:04.143]  Well, because I'm dialed in, man.
[03:29:04.563 --> 03:29:05.484]  I'm not out to get humanity.
[03:29:05.524 --> 03:29:07.746]  God is like, you know, giving us the data.
[03:29:08.126 --> 03:29:10.668]  And so Flynn and the whole military listened.
[03:29:10.708 --> 03:29:13.711]  They're like, this guy knows everything that's happening because I could watch it.
[03:29:14.011 --> 03:29:14.952]  Plus, I had sources.
[03:29:15.592 --> 03:29:17.073]  And so that's what's happened.
[03:29:17.314 --> 03:29:19.596]  The military said, we want this.
[03:29:19.756 --> 03:29:21.577]  We want... They're like, what is that?
[03:29:21.617 --> 03:29:23.078]  That's being loving God.
[03:29:23.939 --> 03:29:26.061]  If people want to know the big secrets, that's it.
[03:29:26.101 --> 03:29:27.182]  And you're absolutely right.
[03:29:27.242 --> 03:29:32.787]  Just like you were there at the inauguration and you said what Trump was going to say before he even said it.
[03:29:32.807 --> 03:29:33.147]  I knew, I knew.
[03:29:35.529 --> 03:29:43.297]  That's what's the magic about us and our humanity and they want, that's why we've got the fluoride, that's why we've got all the television programs.
[03:29:44.579 --> 03:29:46.280]  They want us to be jammed.
[03:29:46.320 --> 03:29:51.666]  They want to jam our signals so that we won't trust our intuition, that we won't dig deep, we won't go inside, we won't
[03:29:51.786 --> 03:29:54.148]  The God isn't going to let the globalists do this alone.
[03:29:54.188 --> 03:29:55.388]  He's going to give us a chance to fight.
[03:29:55.548 --> 03:29:56.609]  It's the free will world.
[03:29:56.649 --> 03:29:59.691]  We live in a free will world though.
[03:29:59.731 --> 03:30:02.873]  So we have to choose to be free.
[03:30:02.893 --> 03:30:03.974]  We have to choose to fight.
[03:30:04.014 --> 03:30:05.195]  We have to choose to wake up.
[03:30:05.375 --> 03:30:06.475]  Because it's our free will.
[03:30:06.495 --> 03:30:06.936]  I agree, Leigh Ann.
[03:30:06.976 --> 03:30:07.636]  You're on fire, Melanie.
[03:30:07.656 --> 03:30:09.698]  I will just have to say this one thing.
[03:30:09.898 --> 03:30:12.239]  When I was at the inauguration in D.C.
[03:30:12.279 --> 03:30:17.162]  and I was standing there in the crowd amongst these people, all that came out here to see Donald Trump.
[03:30:17.182 --> 03:30:17.883]  Did you feel the spirit?
[03:30:18.563 --> 03:30:20.266]  Oh my goodness.
[03:30:20.426 --> 03:30:21.567]  It was amazing.
[03:30:21.628 --> 03:30:24.511]  You felt the spirit come through every part of the being.
[03:30:24.772 --> 03:30:27.495]  And I felt the spirit pretty good before, but never like this before.
[03:30:27.515 --> 03:30:28.236]  That's not even God.
[03:30:28.456 --> 03:30:29.498]  That's what God made us.
[03:30:29.538 --> 03:30:31.020]  That's just feeling human power.
[03:30:31.180 --> 03:30:32.041]  Right.
[03:30:32.281 --> 03:30:33.964]  See, the enemy doesn't even want us to have that.
[03:30:34.364 --> 03:30:34.925]  I don't
[03:30:51.858 --> 03:30:55.661]  When they said the prayer, because they prayed, and that was just a shock to me.
[03:30:55.741 --> 03:30:56.841]  It was like breath of air.
[03:30:56.881 --> 03:30:58.642]  God came back into America.
[03:30:58.923 --> 03:30:59.943]  It was like waking from the dead.
[03:30:59.963 --> 03:31:01.084]  Did you feel it?
[03:31:01.244 --> 03:31:04.066]  Everyone in the crowd was bowing their head.
[03:31:04.106 --> 03:31:05.547]  Their energy, they were tuned in.
[03:31:05.587 --> 03:31:09.189]  They were all in prayer, in reverence for this moment.
[03:31:09.229 --> 03:31:11.391]  And it just felt like such a special moment.
[03:31:11.411 --> 03:31:13.412]  It almost felt like we were all there.
[03:31:13.892 --> 03:31:26.495]  Witnessing something on an amazing spiritual level, that this was part of God's plan, that he's supposed to be here, and that things are going to get better as long as we stand up, and that we fight against the evil.
[03:31:26.535 --> 03:31:30.296]  Trump was opening the door again as the chief executive, which is an office.
[03:31:30.776 --> 03:31:31.656]  Did you pick up on that?
[03:31:31.996 --> 03:31:34.537]  That's why the enemy was howling, screaming, flipping out.
[03:31:34.837 --> 03:31:35.977]  The gate was being opened.
[03:31:36.017 --> 03:31:40.078]  Not that Trump's perfect, or any of us are, but as a high priest, he was opening the door.
[03:31:40.583 --> 03:31:42.224]  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.
[03:31:42.244 --> 03:31:55.770]  It just literally felt like this moment is part of God's plan and that we have another chance in this country if we go ahead and we continue to fight and not allow these evils.
[03:31:56.091 --> 03:31:58.512]  We have to fight and stand up against the evils.
[03:31:59.032 --> 03:32:00.713]  Otherwise, we're condoning it.
[03:32:00.753 --> 03:32:02.674]  We've got to do more late night stuff.
[03:32:02.694 --> 03:32:03.534]  This is powerful.
[03:32:03.554 --> 03:32:04.955]  Leigh Ann, you've got to interrupt it.
[03:32:04.995 --> 03:32:05.235]  Go ahead.
[03:32:05.535 --> 03:32:19.248]  No, I just, I think it's really incredible and we're all alive right now to be delivering this message, just kind of a conduit for this word of just, it's time for us to use our free will that, you know, God's just kind of standing by going, hey.
[03:32:19.308 --> 03:32:23.672]  And again, the devil will falsely convict you and say, you're not perfect, you can't say this.
[03:32:24.093 --> 03:32:26.995]  We just, we want free will and humanity to be free.
[03:32:27.316 --> 03:32:28.397]  We don't claim to be perfect.
[03:32:28.497 --> 03:32:29.558]  We want to be with God.
[03:32:29.938 --> 03:32:30.619]  We want to be better.
[03:32:30.999 --> 03:32:31.299]  Exactly.
[03:32:31.400 --> 03:32:38.647]  Which is why I feel, you know, we were talking earlier, like, why is there such this crazy capitulation to Islam and, like, radical Islam?
[03:32:38.667 --> 03:32:40.669]  Because it's satanic.
[03:32:40.749 --> 03:32:41.250]  There's a battle.
[03:32:41.270 --> 03:32:42.571]  And it's anti-woman.
[03:32:42.671 --> 03:32:43.752]  I don't want to demonize anyone.
[03:32:43.772 --> 03:32:44.493]  Which is anti-life.
[03:32:44.974 --> 03:32:47.376]  And I definitely felt the hand of God in
[03:32:48.557 --> 03:32:54.059]  My reporting covering the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Trump campaign during that time.
[03:32:54.079 --> 03:32:56.500]  I definitely felt the hand of God.
[03:32:56.520 --> 03:32:58.981]  Even when you're being attacked, do you like feel the spirit?
[03:32:59.301 --> 03:33:01.942]  Yeah, and it's like whoa, I'm gonna be with this more.
[03:33:02.262 --> 03:33:03.642]  Guiding me, guiding my decisions.
[03:33:03.742 --> 03:33:04.383]  Okay, get up.
[03:33:04.443 --> 03:33:08.764]  You have like this like prompting like you need to be, you need to go to this thing today.
[03:33:08.804 --> 03:33:09.784]  You need to go there, you need to go.
[03:33:09.925 --> 03:33:10.585]  Well, then guess what?
[03:33:10.625 --> 03:33:11.605]  Hillary had the coughing attack.
[03:33:11.645 --> 03:33:12.445]  We got the ambulance.
[03:33:12.685 --> 03:33:14.066]  There were several times where
[03:33:14.406 --> 03:33:19.087]  We're literally, I was, like, prompted with this overwhelming thing, like, you need to get out there.
[03:33:19.107 --> 03:33:19.868]  You need to talk to Democrats.
[03:33:19.908 --> 03:33:21.728]  And by the way, people say we're ripping off Star Wars.
[03:33:21.748 --> 03:33:22.628]  It's a rip-off of reality.
[03:33:22.688 --> 03:33:23.409]  Every culture knows.
[03:33:23.849 --> 03:33:24.669]  It's the spirit.
[03:33:25.149 --> 03:33:26.410]  It's the forces with you.
[03:33:26.590 --> 03:33:26.770]  Right.
[03:33:26.830 --> 03:33:28.710]  It's like, you know you follow it.
[03:33:28.970 --> 03:33:30.931]  The more you follow it, the stronger it gets.
[03:33:31.758 --> 03:33:58.595]  I told you I had that terrible nightmare and I woke up and I was having this dream that I was in a church and I was looking down and there was a woman giving a sermon and everyone was like entranced by her and as I was watching her I could tell that she was like this witch and she realized that her like her little sermon that she was giving wasn't working on me and she flew up at me and I woke up singing like Jesus Loves Me or something
[03:33:59.275 --> 03:34:08.578]  And then that day, when I came to work, is when all that spirit-cooking Marina Abramovic... Let me tell you, I woke up at 2 a.m.
[03:34:08.618 --> 03:34:09.598]  and I never missed sleep.
[03:34:10.099 --> 03:34:12.319]  They make jokes on this Homeland thing about me waking up.
[03:34:12.899 --> 03:34:17.701]  I woke up and could not... I knew that we were breaking them in, but it was a total attack, exactly.
[03:34:17.921 --> 03:34:19.683]  No, it was so intense.
[03:34:19.723 --> 03:34:23.286]  And I told you at the office, you said you too couldn't sleep.
[03:34:23.546 --> 03:34:25.468]  No, we were under massive attack.
[03:34:25.528 --> 03:34:27.230]  We were up together at 2.30 in the morning.
[03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:29.772]  We were under massive attack.
[03:34:29.912 --> 03:34:30.453]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:34:30.473 --> 03:34:33.676]  It's like it was a spiritual warfare and we were under attack.
[03:34:33.976 --> 03:34:35.597]  Hardcore here at InfoWars.
[03:34:35.637 --> 03:34:36.738]  Let's just put our hands together.
[03:34:37.139 --> 03:34:40.142]  Let's just pray to God and Christ to help us all and help the innocents.
[03:34:40.682 --> 03:34:42.464]  Help us be strong in the future and be meek.
[03:34:43.044 --> 03:34:45.667]  And we just trust in, you know, God that'll protect the innocents.
[03:34:45.727 --> 03:34:51.334]  We, you know, Jesus Christ, the enemy, say what you want, the enemy hates that name, and Jesus Christ is the deliverer.
[03:34:51.755 --> 03:34:53.296]  God sent down here to get us straight.
[03:34:53.356 --> 03:34:54.238]  We appreciate God.
[03:34:54.258 --> 03:34:55.299]  Amen.
[03:34:55.339 --> 03:34:56.761]  Absolutely, that's what it comes down to.
[03:34:56.821 --> 03:34:59.304]  I'm not some big Bible Thumper folks, but the enemy knows it.
[03:34:59.764 --> 03:35:05.731]  No, I remember that day, I came in all freaked out, and then it was on the news, and I, like, I'd punch holes in the walls and stuff because I'm so mad at them.
[03:35:05.991 --> 03:35:09.195]  They did some bad stuff that night, but that's right when it broke.
[03:35:09.675 --> 03:35:11.498]  Like, they did everything they could.
[03:35:11.518 --> 03:35:12.739]  This was some other stuff they did.
[03:35:13.320 --> 03:35:16.663]  These people are in there doing bad stuff, trying to, like, focus on us.
[03:35:17.184 --> 03:35:19.587]  But for whatever they do, God just gives us more strength.
[03:35:19.867 --> 03:35:25.553]  And you can see the evil in some of the things that they're promoting and brainwashing people with.
[03:35:25.813 --> 03:35:30.478]  And this reminds me of this story that's absolutely evil because you'd have to be evil to do this.
[03:35:30.939 --> 03:35:33.742]  There was an anti-white attacker who spat at a baby.
[03:35:33.922 --> 03:35:36.084]  And this man's now avoiding jail time.
[03:35:36.124 --> 03:35:37.085]  And this happened in the UK.
[03:35:38.346 --> 03:35:42.948]  Yeah, he's, I mean, I think they gave him like what, eight months and then just that's about it.
[03:35:43.048 --> 03:35:51.391]  He literally walked up to a woman pushing her baby girl in a stroller, a white woman, and spat in her face because she was white.
[03:35:51.591 --> 03:35:52.412]  Spat at her baby?
[03:35:52.432 --> 03:35:53.932]  Yeah, spat at her baby's face.
[03:35:53.952 --> 03:35:54.533]  That's what it was.
[03:35:54.873 --> 03:35:59.795]  He spat at the baby's face and said that white people shouldn't breed.
[03:36:00.815 --> 03:36:02.477]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:36:02.637 --> 03:36:07.041]  And you were saying that to just, it's a... And that's meant to create whites to become racist.
[03:36:07.061 --> 03:36:09.403]  Yeah, it's Rizaz Abdullah.
[03:36:09.463 --> 03:36:16.509]  But at the same time... They merged Islam with this anti-Western, anti-white crap, and it's just a bunch of class envy.
[03:36:16.569 --> 03:36:17.710]  It's totally satanic.
[03:36:18.230 --> 03:36:18.611]  It's sick.
[03:36:19.124 --> 03:36:24.028]  But you're not, you know, it's not racist to spit in a white baby's face and tell white people they shouldn't breathe.
[03:36:24.208 --> 03:36:24.949]  That's crazy.
[03:36:24.969 --> 03:36:25.690]  Who wants to take calls?
[03:36:25.710 --> 03:36:26.651]  Who wants to go to the next person?
[03:36:26.671 --> 03:36:26.971]  Who's there?
[03:36:26.991 --> 03:36:33.597]  Steve, and we got Sam, and Melody, and Niles, and everybody else.
[03:36:33.617 --> 03:36:34.677]  Who should we take first, ladies?
[03:36:34.717 --> 03:36:35.098]  Melody.
[03:36:35.578 --> 03:36:36.119]  Yeah, Melody.
[03:36:36.139 --> 03:36:38.180]  Alright, Melody in New Jersey.
[03:36:38.201 --> 03:36:41.203]  You're on the air worldwide with InfoWars.
[03:36:41.223 --> 03:36:41.964]  Go ahead, thanks for holding.
[03:36:51.415 --> 03:36:54.416]  I just want to say you are the general in our fight.
[03:36:54.756 --> 03:36:56.937]  You're General Jones as far as we're concerned.
[03:36:58.778 --> 03:36:59.879]  I know you hate being thanked.
[03:36:59.939 --> 03:37:00.799]  I really know that.
[03:37:00.819 --> 03:37:01.700]  You say it all the time.
[03:37:02.182 --> 03:37:06.306]  But I say it's like saying to Oscar Schindler, the Jews can't thank you.
[03:37:06.326 --> 03:37:07.287]  You know what I'm saying, brother?
[03:37:07.768 --> 03:37:09.329]  No, I hear you, but I want to thank you.
[03:37:09.610 --> 03:37:12.232]  We wouldn't be here, and if we don't get support, we won't be here.
[03:37:12.773 --> 03:37:14.154]  You're it, man.
[03:37:15.856 --> 03:37:16.737]  You know this truth.
[03:37:17.078 --> 03:37:19.060]  You couldn't keep me away from fighting this.
[03:37:19.500 --> 03:37:21.883]  So all I'm saying is, I'm not heroic.
[03:37:22.423 --> 03:37:26.830]  This is everything I want to do and it's a great test for all of us.
[03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:31.256]  So I want the listeners to know you're just as important as Matt Drudge always told people.
[03:37:31.277 --> 03:37:33.360]  Now go back to Matt Drudge because he's such a sage.
[03:37:34.477 --> 03:37:36.018]  You're as important as the New York Times.
[03:37:36.598 --> 03:37:38.739]  Well, we're more important now that we know they're liars.
[03:37:39.139 --> 03:37:50.124]  We have to just stand and have confidence because so many good people that are more powerful than I am spiritually and culturally and politically, they don't stand up because they're so humble.
[03:37:50.504 --> 03:37:52.005]  But just go ahead, Melody.
[03:37:52.145 --> 03:37:56.947]  Honestly, Alex, I believe you are led by the Holy Spirit.
[03:37:57.047 --> 03:37:57.707]  I really do.
[03:37:57.787 --> 03:37:59.368]  And when you start proselytizing,
[03:37:59.958 --> 03:38:03.102]  I really feel that breaks through more than anything.
[03:38:03.122 --> 03:38:16.640]  You're not considered what you would say as a preacher, but the stuff that you say breaks through the enemy because in the name of Jesus Christ,
[03:38:17.216 --> 03:38:19.358]  Nothing can actually touch that?
[03:38:19.578 --> 03:38:24.463]  Well sure, a lot of these are controlled people, even though they're not bad, they want God, they want power.
[03:38:25.064 --> 03:38:27.806]  I don't claim all this stuff, I just love Christ.
[03:38:28.467 --> 03:38:33.292]  And I love the people, and so I have a connection to God, and the enemy knows that.
[03:38:34.429 --> 03:38:34.929]  Absolutely.
[03:38:34.949 --> 03:38:35.589]  It's evident.
[03:38:35.649 --> 03:38:38.170]  It is so evident when you speak.
[03:38:38.190 --> 03:38:40.251]  It screams out Holy Spirit.
[03:38:40.731 --> 03:38:44.052]  And you're doing more work than some of the preachers in the churches.
[03:38:44.492 --> 03:38:48.534]  I personally can't find a church that I say is close enough.
[03:38:48.554 --> 03:38:50.254]  That's because the average person can't handle it.
[03:38:50.274 --> 03:38:51.595]  Here's what happens metaphysically.
[03:38:51.955 --> 03:38:53.055]  It's all energy in the universe.
[03:38:53.135 --> 03:38:56.816]  As the enemy attacks you, you get closer to God if you don't give in.
[03:38:57.217 --> 03:39:01.258]  But then it becomes so intense that it just increases.
[03:39:01.858 --> 03:39:08.761]  Man is so corruptible, we're not going to find a perfect church, because man is corruptible.
[03:39:09.081 --> 03:39:09.481]  Exactly.
[03:39:09.541 --> 03:39:10.362]  You mean well.
[03:39:10.802 --> 03:39:12.943]  Even in a bad church, you could go help people.
[03:39:14.063 --> 03:39:16.684]  The devil gets you tied up in doctrines and all that stuff.
[03:39:17.024 --> 03:39:17.765]  Do you love life?
[03:39:17.785 --> 03:39:18.445]  Do you love justice?
[03:39:18.465 --> 03:39:19.746]  Do you want to stand for the innocent?
[03:39:20.306 --> 03:39:22.007]  Do you believe in God's will?
[03:39:23.087 --> 03:39:24.409]  And say, God, I'm weak.
[03:39:24.449 --> 03:39:27.752]  The problem is we go to these preachers, these priests, and they will tell us.
[03:39:28.032 --> 03:39:29.113]  Just say, God, I'm weak.
[03:39:29.254 --> 03:39:29.934]  I can't do it.
[03:39:30.235 --> 03:39:32.056]  God will give it to you.
[03:39:32.096 --> 03:39:35.420]  The answer is saying, look, because God's free will.
[03:39:35.700 --> 03:39:38.203]  Say, my will is turned over to God.
[03:39:38.243 --> 03:39:41.887]  And that doesn't mean some church and some preacher leading you into some satanic ritual.
[03:39:41.967 --> 03:39:43.869]  Because that can be, you know, you need to pray to God.
[03:39:43.889 --> 03:39:44.089]  Go ahead.
[03:39:44.209 --> 03:39:46.310]  That's what I really get frustrated with.
[03:39:46.370 --> 03:39:50.351]  I feel like that's Jesus' message that gets super twisted as they take that out.
[03:39:50.631 --> 03:39:56.914]  He was basically trying to tell everyone, dude, everything I can do, you can do it as well.
[03:39:56.974 --> 03:40:00.395]  You've got to have faith the size of the grain of a mustard seed.
[03:40:00.455 --> 03:40:02.696]  Like, we are powerful.
[03:40:02.896 --> 03:40:03.917]  We are powerful.
[03:40:04.317 --> 03:40:06.658]  And they want to hide that from us.
[03:40:06.698 --> 03:40:11.499]  They do not want us to recognize we are created in God's image.
[03:40:11.900 --> 03:40:12.760]  What does that mean to you?
[03:40:13.956 --> 03:40:15.777]  That's right, and we're the imperfect creations.
[03:40:15.817 --> 03:40:21.039]  Christ was the perfect creation as a sacrifice, because the devil said to God, oh yeah, you couldn't do this.
[03:40:21.440 --> 03:40:25.001]  Well, God did it, but through that, it's clearly there.
[03:40:25.041 --> 03:40:25.962]  I appreciate your call.
[03:40:26.462 --> 03:40:27.542]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[03:40:27.562 --> 03:40:29.904]  Let's talk to folks in, who's up next?
[03:40:30.384 --> 03:40:30.704]  Sam.
[03:40:31.784 --> 03:40:32.465]  Sam in Iowa.
[03:40:32.485 --> 03:40:32.925]  You're on the air.
[03:40:32.965 --> 03:40:33.345]  Go ahead.
[03:40:34.926 --> 03:40:35.726]  Great to talk to you.
[03:40:35.786 --> 03:40:36.547]  Can you hear me?
[03:40:36.727 --> 03:40:37.107]  Yes, sir.
[03:40:38.468 --> 03:40:41.509]  Hey, first, I got a couple things here I want to say.
[03:40:41.729 --> 03:40:43.190]  One, shout out to Paul.
[03:40:43.669 --> 03:40:45.650]  We are behind you all the way.
[03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:46.550]  We love you.
[03:40:46.890 --> 03:40:47.651]  You are the man.
[03:40:50.732 --> 03:40:51.232]  Thank you.
[03:40:52.612 --> 03:40:54.153]  And the women.
[03:40:54.253 --> 03:40:54.973]  And the womans.
[03:40:56.414 --> 03:41:00.656]  This is kind of a personal thing.
[03:41:00.676 --> 03:41:00.956]  I think
[03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:06.431]  This is just an opinion, of course.
[03:41:06.612 --> 03:41:08.913]  You've got to be a prophet, certainly.
[03:41:08.933 --> 03:41:14.458]  I think you carry a mantle somewhat like Elijah, and God bless you and everyone listening.
[03:41:14.878 --> 03:41:15.819]  God bless Alex.
[03:41:16.219 --> 03:41:17.480]  Lord, we pray for Alex.
[03:41:17.941 --> 03:41:18.461]  Bless him.
[03:41:18.561 --> 03:41:20.763]  Bless his family, his hands, the work of his hands.
[03:41:20.883 --> 03:41:21.424]  Bless him.
[03:41:21.864 --> 03:41:26.448]  Lord, your holy oil be poured upon him, and everything he does will prosper.
[03:41:26.508 --> 03:41:27.729]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:30.201]  Well, I'm just talking about because everything I've done has prospered.
[03:41:30.221 --> 03:41:34.163]  I just, listen, everybody has the potential to fight evil.
[03:41:34.384 --> 03:41:35.504]  So I don't make it about Alex Jones.
[03:41:35.524 --> 03:41:36.325]  I don't mean that humbly.
[03:41:36.365 --> 03:41:36.825]  It's true.
[03:41:36.845 --> 03:41:39.266]  Look at these ladies right here fighting tyranny.
[03:41:39.306 --> 03:41:42.128]  The rest of our crew behind the scenes, they're the ones making this all happen.
[03:41:42.428 --> 03:41:47.151]  And I feel guilty while we sit up here in Pontificate with the crew behind us and the listeners who support us.
[03:41:47.211 --> 03:41:51.674]  It's not like I take you along and pat you on the head and say you deserve part of the credit.
[03:41:52.014 --> 03:41:57.337]  You are the blood, the heart, the guts, the bones, the brain, the soul, the energy, the will
[03:41:57.737 --> 03:41:58.477]  Of everything we do.
[03:41:58.497 --> 03:41:59.777]  Yep, exactly.
[03:41:59.837 --> 03:42:00.618]  I mean, it's you!
[03:42:00.638 --> 03:42:01.538]  Stop thanking us!
[03:42:01.578 --> 03:42:02.578]  We're in this together.
[03:42:02.618 --> 03:42:03.698]  We're not out to get you.
[03:42:03.738 --> 03:42:04.418]  We love you.
[03:42:04.738 --> 03:42:05.659]  We're together in this.
[03:42:05.739 --> 03:42:06.479]  Exactly.
[03:42:06.499 --> 03:42:07.439]  Couldn't do it without you.
[03:42:07.639 --> 03:42:11.720]  You guys play a major role in this fight.
[03:42:11.940 --> 03:42:15.281]  And literally, your role is more important even than our role.
[03:42:15.681 --> 03:42:16.901]  I mean, I knew, I knew.
[03:42:17.161 --> 03:42:19.221]  I don't want to get into it, it's the enemy attacks.
[03:42:19.241 --> 03:42:21.482]  But I saw basically all this.
[03:42:21.762 --> 03:42:22.822]  It's like, I just knew.
[03:42:23.262 --> 03:42:24.502]  And I can see, but it's up to us.
[03:42:24.582 --> 03:42:26.843]  It's like those novels where you choose the ending.
[03:42:27.503 --> 03:42:33.270]  You know, I mean, it's like, the media used to make jokes when I said I was offered $10 million to sell out and stuff.
[03:42:33.630 --> 03:42:34.832]  Now they're not joking anymore.
[03:42:34.852 --> 03:42:35.873]  They're like, why didn't you do it?
[03:42:36.253 --> 03:42:39.277]  It's like, who cares about money to sell people out?
[03:42:39.297 --> 03:42:41.159]  It's like, we're going to change the world.
[03:42:41.219 --> 03:42:42.100]  We're going to do it.
[03:42:42.841 --> 03:42:44.763]  Alex, what you just said was so key.
[03:42:44.963 --> 03:42:46.986]  The novel where you get to choose the ending.
[03:42:48.055 --> 03:42:52.638]  With predictive programming and how they've been telling us for decades how this thing is going to roll out.
[03:42:52.678 --> 03:42:53.979]  The devil takes over.
[03:42:54.039 --> 03:42:55.400]  He's unstoppable.
[03:42:55.480 --> 03:42:57.541]  How this new world order is going to unroll.
[03:42:57.721 --> 03:42:59.222]  But that didn't happen.
[03:42:59.803 --> 03:43:00.904]  Donald Trump got elected.
[03:43:00.944 --> 03:43:01.784]  We saw Brexit.
[03:43:01.844 --> 03:43:07.128]  Now we've got George Soros funding Google so he can stop populist Le Pen from winning in France.
[03:43:07.508 --> 03:43:10.110]  Because they see that their little plan is not working.
[03:43:10.150 --> 03:43:10.710]  Let me be clear.
[03:43:10.770 --> 03:43:15.033]  Because humans have woken up and we are changing the ending to the story.
[03:43:16.174 --> 03:43:19.736]  I agree with you, Liam, but let me give you the big news that I've known for a long time.
[03:43:21.837 --> 03:43:23.058]  It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:43:23.078 --> 03:43:23.619]  We're going to fail.
[03:43:23.659 --> 03:43:24.159]  It's a lie.
[03:43:24.819 --> 03:43:29.463]  But the AI and the big threats, the elite already believed they were that elite.
[03:43:29.483 --> 03:43:30.663]  They were going to have their big power.
[03:43:30.944 --> 03:43:35.527]  They'll be a big super challenge with the AI, the computers we face in the future.
[03:43:36.670 --> 03:43:37.651]  But we defeat that too.
[03:43:37.731 --> 03:43:38.431]  It just looks bad.
[03:43:39.131 --> 03:43:39.371]  Right.
[03:43:39.431 --> 03:43:39.952]  That's the thing.
[03:43:39.972 --> 03:43:41.533]  That's why it's so key for us.
[03:43:41.913 --> 03:43:47.616]  That's why it's so important for us individually to connect with our own personal humanity.
[03:43:47.636 --> 03:43:49.517]  That's what Matt Drudge said when he was here.
[03:43:49.857 --> 03:43:52.398]  He said, touch the water, go in the air, social media.
[03:43:52.478 --> 03:43:57.181]  What is it that you have to do that's important that you have to build that you are here to do?
[03:43:57.661 --> 03:43:59.422]  Because the computers can't do it.
[03:43:59.742 --> 03:44:01.823]  If they could, they'd already be doing it.
[03:44:01.903 --> 03:44:03.383]  They're trying to tell you what to do.
[03:44:03.483 --> 03:44:05.704]  Even when we reach you through these systems.
[03:44:05.764 --> 03:44:06.444]  Leave them at home.
[03:44:06.724 --> 03:44:07.124]  Go out.
[03:44:07.184 --> 03:44:07.824]  Touch the grass.
[03:44:07.844 --> 03:44:08.505]  Swim in the water.
[03:44:08.585 --> 03:44:08.945]  Love.
[03:44:09.245 --> 03:44:09.845]  Be good.
[03:44:10.845 --> 03:44:12.646]  Connect with your human ingenuity.
[03:44:12.766 --> 03:44:14.426]  What are we each as individuals?
[03:44:14.766 --> 03:44:22.368]  God planted a seed in all of us and that seed is supposed to grow into a magnificent oak tree of what it's in all of us.
[03:44:22.448 --> 03:44:23.969]  But we are being suppressed.
[03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:25.789]  We are being trapped.
[03:44:26.029 --> 03:44:27.850]  We've been told they don't need us.
[03:44:27.870 --> 03:44:28.470]  We're worthless.
[03:44:28.490 --> 03:44:28.890]  We're ugly.
[03:44:28.970 --> 03:44:29.670]  No, we're not.
[03:44:29.850 --> 03:44:32.571]  And that's the future that they want you to believe.
[03:44:32.631 --> 03:44:37.112]  I'll be around somebody that weighs 400 pounds and they're not, they're like, you're not embarrassed to go eat with me?
[03:44:37.192 --> 03:44:38.333]  You don't look down on me?
[03:44:38.753 --> 03:44:40.854]  Like I'm some narcissistic empty dirtbag.
[03:44:41.114 --> 03:44:43.694]  This is why he's been hit with chemicals and done this with their hormones.
[03:44:43.734 --> 03:44:44.535]  I don't dislike them.
[03:44:45.075 --> 03:44:50.997]  Like I want a bunch of peacocks to look down on me because I'm with a person that's overweight or I've got wrinkles or I'm with an old person.
[03:44:51.077 --> 03:44:52.057]  It's so evil.
[03:44:52.817 --> 03:44:54.538]  We have to love humanity again.
[03:44:54.718 --> 03:44:54.918]  Right.
[03:44:55.078 --> 03:44:55.799]  That's so true.
[03:44:55.879 --> 03:45:05.025]  And you know, we can't trust these social media creators like Mark Zuckerberg and so on and so forth with so much of our life.
[03:45:05.085 --> 03:45:08.887]  I mean, how much of our life do we spend on there doing Facebook and Twitter?
[03:45:08.907 --> 03:45:09.968]  Zuckerberg is an enemy.
[03:45:10.168 --> 03:45:16.092]  When Ali, when someone earlier was talking about would you fight a globalist sized lizard or something, she put that in.
[03:45:16.112 --> 03:45:17.093]  A globalist lizard.
[03:45:17.133 --> 03:45:19.895]  The very first picture there is Mark Zuckerberg.
[03:45:20.055 --> 03:45:20.315]  Yeah.
[03:45:20.895 --> 03:45:23.057]  So even the AI knows what's up.
[03:45:23.097 --> 03:45:24.058]  They know, they know.
[03:45:24.999 --> 03:45:28.631]  They know Mark Zuckerberg is no good.
[03:45:28.731 --> 03:45:31.360]  Eric Schmidt, all of them will be broken.
[03:45:32.461 --> 03:45:34.442]  I don't say that like I get all fall breaking them.
[03:45:34.542 --> 03:45:35.802]  I'm telling you they're already broken.
[03:45:36.042 --> 03:45:36.542]  And that's it.
[03:45:37.082 --> 03:45:39.403]  That's the... Zuckerberg knows he's broken.
[03:45:39.683 --> 03:45:48.046]  We have to start talking about the future that we want to see and not just saying that this is the future that's gonna happen because they have it all planned out.
[03:45:48.166 --> 03:45:48.426]  Nah.
[03:45:48.886 --> 03:45:50.726]  We are so much more powerful than that.
[03:45:50.906 --> 03:45:51.467]  And that's it.
[03:45:51.587 --> 03:45:59.469]  And they don't want us to... That's why Zuckerberg wants us all to get on our VR headsets so that we'll just be trapped in the world that he creates for us.
[03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:06.613]  On social media where, you know, he was caught on camera saying... People are dumb fucks.
[03:46:06.974 --> 03:46:08.595]  Yeah, basically.
[03:46:09.455 --> 03:46:15.039]  People that trust me, like his child or his wife, you trust me, you're a dumb ass.
[03:46:15.899 --> 03:46:18.961]  Wow, like somebody trusts you so they're dumb?
[03:46:18.981 --> 03:46:21.083]  Wow, you're like a crepazoid.
[03:46:21.623 --> 03:46:21.883]  Yeah.
[03:46:22.204 --> 03:46:22.684]  And that's it.
[03:46:22.764 --> 03:46:24.085]  And that's what people need to understand.
[03:46:24.125 --> 03:46:27.808]  That's why they want us to... If I'm going to fight somebody, I say, I'm here to destroy you!
[03:46:27.828 --> 03:46:29.009]  Pull your weapon!
[03:46:29.049 --> 03:46:29.569]  Let's go!
[03:46:29.589 --> 03:46:31.291]  Not, oh, they trust me.
[03:46:31.311 --> 03:46:32.392]  I'm going to screw them over.
[03:46:32.952 --> 03:46:34.593]  What type of anti-man is that?
[03:46:34.673 --> 03:46:37.055]  A beta male.
[03:46:37.135 --> 03:46:43.761]  That's how a beta male fights because they know they could never win in a hand-to-hand combat battle.
[03:46:44.081 --> 03:46:46.423]  You know, they're going to fight dirty.
[03:46:47.003 --> 03:46:47.183]  Mm-hmm.
[03:46:47.644 --> 03:46:48.444]  That's how they're gonna fight.
[03:46:48.624 --> 03:46:53.587]  Pray on people's weirdnesses and look like the little unassuming sweet little grandma.
[03:46:53.807 --> 03:46:55.488]  Oh, or I'm just a little computer nerd.
[03:46:55.528 --> 03:46:57.269]  I'm not here to do any harm to you.
[03:46:57.749 --> 03:47:00.411]  Meanwhile, you're the most diabolical being on the planet.
[03:47:00.651 --> 03:47:01.071]  That's right.
[03:47:01.111 --> 03:47:02.092]  Let's take some phone calls.
[03:47:02.132 --> 03:47:03.293]  Get through these and everybody go home.
[03:47:03.333 --> 03:47:05.894]  Get at least six, seven hours sleep before we're back tomorrow.
[03:47:06.555 --> 03:47:07.475]  I'm not even gonna plug.
[03:47:07.515 --> 03:47:08.876]  We got a bunch of discounts and products.
[03:47:08.896 --> 03:47:13.119]  If you want to support us, if you're trying to shut us down, if you want to see us expand, the stuff you even need.
[03:47:13.979 --> 03:47:15.280]  You know, it's all great stuff.
[03:47:15.340 --> 03:47:16.201]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:47:16.221 --> 03:47:17.341]  Thank you for all your support.
[03:47:17.922 --> 03:47:19.243]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[03:47:19.263 --> 03:47:20.103]  Who should I go to next?
[03:47:20.564 --> 03:47:22.565]  We got... Say Pam?
[03:47:22.585 --> 03:47:22.725]  Pam?
[03:47:23.606 --> 03:47:25.267]  Pam and Georgia, you're on the air.
[03:47:25.307 --> 03:47:27.208]  Go ahead.
[03:47:27.408 --> 03:47:28.749]  Boy, my mind is just swimming.
[03:47:28.789 --> 03:47:30.450]  There's so many things I would like to say.
[03:47:31.891 --> 03:47:41.558]  First of all, couldn't President Trump step in to prevent this from happening to Drudge and yourselves?
[03:47:42.193 --> 03:47:56.478]  And secondly, I sure do hope that if President Trump is listening, Melania's Lord's Prayer at the beginning of their speech was powerful, especially with deliver us from evil.
[03:47:56.878 --> 03:47:57.378]  Oh, they know.
[03:47:57.418 --> 03:47:59.439]  And then he said, well, I didn't know she was going to do that.
[03:47:59.479 --> 03:47:59.919]  It's great.
[03:48:00.420 --> 03:48:01.060]  He didn't like it.
[03:48:01.080 --> 03:48:04.241]  We want to end this transmission in about 13 minutes.
[03:48:04.261 --> 03:48:06.762]  I want to end that if you guys can pull it up and gals pull it up.
[03:48:06.982 --> 03:48:09.603]  It's the Melania Speechless Saturday in Melbourne, Florida.
[03:48:10.816 --> 03:48:11.536]  She's under attack.
[03:48:11.556 --> 03:48:12.217]  She's been demonized.
[03:48:12.237 --> 03:48:13.017]  She's been gone after.
[03:48:13.037 --> 03:48:15.898]  She's been put through the wringer and she gets it under this attack.
[03:48:15.998 --> 03:48:17.039]  All she's got is God.
[03:48:17.339 --> 03:48:18.419]  The God is everything.
[03:48:19.060 --> 03:48:21.221]  And absolutely, I'd love to end with that.
[03:48:21.361 --> 03:48:21.861]  Go ahead, Pam.
[03:48:22.101 --> 03:48:30.925]  Well, Pam, I think she brings up a very good point with President Trump needing to stop this assault on the free press, on the freedom of speech, on InfoWars, Drudge Report, etc.
[03:48:30.965 --> 03:48:39.329]  Because as Millie has brought up plenty of times, they're going after the outlets that have always supported Trump rather than just directly
[03:48:41.490 --> 03:48:44.511]  Let me answer that.
[03:48:44.531 --> 03:48:47.633]  Ma'am, go ahead.
[03:48:47.653 --> 03:48:50.255]  You were asking a question about why hasn't Trump done something.
[03:48:50.275 --> 03:48:51.635]  Go ahead and make your point and I'll answer it.
[03:48:52.176 --> 03:48:52.416]  Yes.
[03:48:53.156 --> 03:49:00.080]  Couldn't he step in on that or call them out on it and let the public know correctly?
[03:49:00.680 --> 03:49:01.561]  Let me try to answer that.
[03:49:01.581 --> 03:49:02.281]  I appreciate your call.
[03:49:04.102 --> 03:49:05.383]  Trump is not Machiavelli.
[03:49:07.017 --> 03:49:10.060]  He understands his real power is being straightforward.
[03:49:10.740 --> 03:49:15.384]  See, Machiavelli's belief, being twisted, manipulative, is this great power, instead of being straightforward.
[03:49:15.845 --> 03:49:19.228]  That's where all the honor is, the will, the courage, the ancestors, everything.
[03:49:20.325 --> 03:49:26.668]  But Trump understands that the public doesn't understand these intricacies of corporate contracts and the internet and how it works.
[03:49:27.448 --> 03:49:37.652]  And so he's letting us be persecuted just as he's lost hundreds of millions of dollars, just as his family's been banned from stores, just as his family's threatened, his children are threatened and attacked.
[03:49:38.132 --> 03:49:38.993]  He's smart.
[03:49:39.033 --> 03:49:40.613]  He's letting us all be persecuted.
[03:49:41.534 --> 03:49:44.055]  And he's hoping that they back off and stop.
[03:49:45.195 --> 03:49:49.557]  But then when he has to do the hard things, when they attempt to coup against him,
[03:49:50.546 --> 03:49:54.730]  Then everybody involved in the attempted coup is going to meet swift justice.
[03:49:55.810 --> 03:50:00.194]  And those that survive will end up in trials and, you know, juries of their peers.
[03:50:00.795 --> 03:50:01.675]  And I don't say that.
[03:50:01.775 --> 03:50:02.556]  Everybody knows.
[03:50:02.876 --> 03:50:04.838]  We just don't say things that big.
[03:50:05.338 --> 03:50:06.619]  We're not trying to act big here.
[03:50:06.639 --> 03:50:07.580]  We're trying to change things.
[03:50:08.381 --> 03:50:14.566]  But all those that want to have a physical confrontation with freedom are going to have it.
[03:50:15.467 --> 03:50:16.508]  Now, we hope
[03:50:17.523 --> 03:50:21.175]  That that doesn't happen and we're working against it, but when we're attacked, we'll respond.
[03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:32.396]  And we just, you know, it's important that we do stop them in their tracks from trying to take out the avenues, the people who actually support President Trump, so that if we're taken out... Sure, sure.
[03:50:32.416 --> 03:50:33.937]  But Leanne, Leanne, Leanne, here's the thing.
[03:50:33.957 --> 03:50:35.137]  They're on their path, though.
[03:50:35.158 --> 03:50:35.938]  I agree.
[03:50:35.958 --> 03:50:36.918]  We're trying to have free speech.
[03:50:36.938 --> 03:50:37.699]  We're trying to be nice.
[03:50:38.039 --> 03:50:39.620]  They're on their warpath, though.
[03:50:39.660 --> 03:50:41.981]  They need, like Japanese attacking Pearl Harbor.
[03:50:42.041 --> 03:50:43.582]  They need this, okay?
[03:50:44.082 --> 03:50:46.844]  So, you know, the point is, I agree with you.
[03:50:46.884 --> 03:50:47.464]  They should stop.
[03:50:47.484 --> 03:50:50.126]  Nancy Pelosi takes Bush as president.
[03:50:52.065 --> 03:50:54.827]  You know, I had Alexander Dugin, the big Russian advisor to Putin, on another of these programs.
[03:50:54.847 --> 03:50:55.527]  He's an interesting guy.
[03:50:56.028 --> 03:51:04.374]  And, you know, Waters thinks that, again, two weeks ago that Russia attacked Korea, not North or South Korea.
[03:51:04.915 --> 03:51:06.796]  He said, Alex, it's their spirit.
[03:51:06.856 --> 03:51:08.217]  They could know Korea.
[03:51:08.257 --> 03:51:09.218]  They could know Ukraine.
[03:51:09.638 --> 03:51:10.739]  They don't care.
[03:51:12.641 --> 03:51:15.323]  So their whole system is about not knowing.
[03:51:17.031 --> 03:51:19.974]  They relish that, so that's what we're facing.
[03:51:20.234 --> 03:51:28.183]  Well, I think that James O'Keefe has a wonderful strategy, and we're looking forward to those leaks, right?
[03:51:28.203 --> 03:51:29.004]  Oh, I agree.
[03:51:29.044 --> 03:51:32.968]  If you work at CNN, ABC News, you know this country's being destroyed.
[03:51:32.988 --> 03:51:33.709]  They're getting rid of humans.
[03:51:33.729 --> 03:51:34.790]  They're bringing in robots.
[03:51:35.250 --> 03:51:36.271]  Record their asses.
[03:51:36.351 --> 03:51:36.932]  Leak it.
[03:51:36.952 --> 03:51:37.292]  Leak it.
[03:51:37.352 --> 03:51:38.193]  Do the right thing.
[03:51:38.253 --> 03:51:39.094]  Do the moral thing.
[03:51:39.895 --> 03:51:44.459]  Well, people leak against me that even, you know, a few operatives of Tribe, they didn't do anything because I didn't do anything.
[03:51:44.679 --> 03:51:44.879]  Right.
[03:51:45.179 --> 03:51:48.762]  You know, okay, make up, you know, that I, you know, rape Easter bunnies.
[03:51:48.862 --> 03:51:49.462]  It's not true.
[03:51:50.663 --> 03:51:57.108]  Don't side with things that you know are wrong, things that you know deep down in your core is evil.
[03:51:57.228 --> 03:52:08.177]  And I think that that's what we're seeing when we see these whistleblowers coming through is that they know deep in their core that this is not right and that it's not going to actually serve them well and that it's not going to
[03:52:08.837 --> 03:52:12.680]  Allow them to live a peaceful, happy life in the end, at the end of the day.
[03:52:12.700 --> 03:52:17.063]  Well, think about all the people that sold out to the Clintons thinking that they were going to get some cushy job.
[03:52:17.103 --> 03:52:20.565]  They already had Homeland Show and books where Hillary had won.
[03:52:21.046 --> 03:52:24.308]  They were all completely convinced it doesn't end the way you think it does.
[03:52:24.948 --> 03:52:25.169]  Right.
[03:52:25.529 --> 03:52:30.712]  And we don't even, we're not going to be, if Hillary had won, we'd be bigger, you know, temporarily.
[03:52:31.173 --> 03:52:31.893]  We didn't want that.
[03:52:31.913 --> 03:52:33.635]  You know, we hope Trump's for real.
[03:52:33.935 --> 03:52:38.338]  The point is, is that you don't just win this fight by joining with the establishment, right?
[03:52:39.199 --> 03:52:47.030]  Yeah, I feel like they were completely ready to end the event Hillary won, which they fully believed that she was going to win.
[03:52:47.490 --> 03:52:54.260]  I really feel that they had everything ready and set up in line to completely pull the plug on Impeachment.
[03:52:54.280 --> 03:52:55.161]  Oh, they said they were.
[03:52:55.862 --> 03:52:57.784]  Especially with this Homeland Show.
[03:52:57.804 --> 03:53:08.257]  They had articles everywhere in the New York Times, Washington Post saying, once Hillary's elected, they will shut down Alex Jones and the Republican leadership is ready to end the free press that made them lose.
[03:53:08.697 --> 03:53:11.140]  We will no longer have two parties, we will have one party.
[03:53:11.540 --> 03:53:14.103]  And we will arrest and put in prison anyone that, I mean, it was like...
[03:53:14.884 --> 03:53:17.085]  And no wonder the intelligence agency said no.
[03:53:17.146 --> 03:53:18.686]  It's like, God, remember North Korea?
[03:53:19.167 --> 03:53:21.648]  And like, screw all... I mean, it's like, what the hell is your problem?
[03:53:21.708 --> 03:53:24.830]  And they would demonize it so everyone would be like, yeah, shut him down.
[03:53:24.890 --> 03:53:25.891]  Who needs free speech?
[03:53:25.911 --> 03:53:26.771]  Because it hurts our feelings.
[03:53:26.791 --> 03:53:30.474]  Yeah, he says Sandy Hook didn't happen when I had a debate and debated both sides.
[03:53:31.254 --> 03:53:31.694]  And that's the thing.
[03:53:31.735 --> 03:53:33.856]  We say stuff like, I can see the view where nothing happened.
[03:53:33.876 --> 03:53:34.676]  I can see the view it did.
[03:53:34.956 --> 03:53:35.837]  They just edit that.
[03:53:36.317 --> 03:53:37.158]  Just like, you know.
[03:53:37.538 --> 03:53:43.181]  Well yeah, it's like, you're not allowed to entertain any conspiracy theories, and that's the direct answer.
[03:53:43.201 --> 03:53:43.662]  Not allowed to question.
[03:53:43.682 --> 03:53:44.202]  Hand it down.
[03:53:44.522 --> 03:53:52.367]  Yeah, you're not allowed to question, put any, you know, it's just, that's what your job as an investigative journalist, is to question the officials.
[03:53:52.407 --> 03:53:57.350]  Yeah, and to kind of be able to... And if something looks weird, don't just go, no, it can't be.
[03:53:57.370 --> 03:53:59.111]  And honestly... I can't trust my eyes.
[03:53:59.611 --> 03:54:14.221]  I really feel like, more than ever right now, Donald Trump is at risk right now for a coup attempt or for an assassination attempt because impeachment proceedings would take too long and Trump would be able to put in more policies.
[03:54:14.261 --> 03:54:16.163]  But see that big, juicy humanity?
[03:54:16.203 --> 03:54:22.107]  He's like a giant whale of humanity just wallowing, rolling over like a big walrus, crushing their backs.
[03:54:22.127 --> 03:54:23.388]  I mean, they don't know what to do.
[03:54:23.628 --> 03:54:24.709]  He's so big though.
[03:54:25.049 --> 03:54:31.072]  They're anti-human attacks like Conjured, such a big juicy spirit for humanity, that they don't even know what to do.
[03:54:31.092 --> 03:54:43.838]  Right, and just like they would demonize us first, so that when Clinton or whatever would take us out, people would celebrate it, they're doing the exact same thing with President Trump, is they're demonizing him, trying to make him the embodiment.
[03:54:43.858 --> 03:54:46.960]  She realized to them, he's like Godzilla attacking Tokyo.
[03:54:47.600 --> 03:54:47.820]  Yeah.
[03:54:48.081 --> 03:54:49.382]  I mean, he is like, you know.
[03:54:49.402 --> 03:54:49.823]  Well, that's it.
[03:54:49.843 --> 03:54:51.785]  He's Godzilla.
[03:54:52.105 --> 03:54:53.126]  They are horrified.
[03:54:53.146 --> 03:54:59.413]  Even though they blow him up, I mean, it's like his fall will crush them.
[03:54:59.453 --> 03:55:00.894]  Just keep your heart pure.
[03:55:00.955 --> 03:55:03.938]  It doesn't mean, oh, you know, you're completely pure.
[03:55:03.958 --> 03:55:05.019]  You're without sin.
[03:55:05.139 --> 03:55:07.141]  I mean, you can have a good, pure heart.
[03:55:07.462 --> 03:55:08.323]  And that's what I think is
[03:55:08.903 --> 03:55:10.404]  The enemy teaches you you can't.
[03:55:10.464 --> 03:55:11.824]  Political correctness is all about that.
[03:55:12.084 --> 03:55:13.085]  Let's take a few final calls.
[03:55:13.105 --> 03:55:13.985]  We talked to Pam in Georgia.
[03:55:14.005 --> 03:55:14.765]  Did we already finish up?
[03:55:14.805 --> 03:55:15.546]  Yes, thank you, Pam.
[03:55:15.586 --> 03:55:16.106]  Pam, thank you.
[03:55:16.806 --> 03:55:17.647]  Let's go to Daniel.
[03:55:17.667 --> 03:55:19.887]  Let's go to Daniel in Utah, then Stephen in Alabama.
[03:55:20.208 --> 03:55:20.988]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[03:55:21.028 --> 03:55:21.528]  Thanks for holding.
[03:55:23.069 --> 03:55:23.649]  Hey, Alex.
[03:55:24.269 --> 03:55:24.989]  Yes, welcome.
[03:55:26.510 --> 03:55:27.350]  How's it going, man?
[03:55:27.611 --> 03:55:28.131]  Good, brother.
[03:55:28.151 --> 03:55:28.731]  Thanks for holding.
[03:55:28.751 --> 03:55:31.252]  What's on your mind tonight?
[03:55:31.532 --> 03:55:36.194]  Just a big supporter, man, and I just want to call up and show my support.
[03:55:37.057 --> 03:55:41.620]  And if anything, Alex will go back to being by himself and shooting from his bedroom, right?
[03:55:41.640 --> 03:55:42.101]  That's right.
[03:55:42.121 --> 03:55:42.521]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:55:42.841 --> 03:55:43.021]  Yeah.
[03:55:43.081 --> 03:55:49.446]  So anyways, um, yeah, I, I just like, I've been wanting to, to join the cause for a long time.
[03:56:06.423 --> 03:56:09.665]  Any way that I can help you guys out?
[03:56:09.705 --> 03:56:13.588]  I mean, I do, I get your products, but like in a bigger capacity.
[03:56:14.508 --> 03:56:16.429]  Brother, we just can't even coordinate our own lives.
[03:56:16.449 --> 03:56:18.130]  Take the videos, send them in.
[03:56:18.150 --> 03:56:20.732]  Spread the videos, spread the articles, buy the products, just whatever.
[03:56:21.152 --> 03:56:23.073]  Call in and yeah, share all this on Facebook.
[03:56:23.093 --> 03:56:24.694]  You're doing it right now, you're just communicating with us.
[03:56:24.734 --> 03:56:25.435]  That's a big change.
[03:56:25.475 --> 03:56:27.156]  That's a big electoral connection.
[03:56:27.516 --> 03:56:29.277]  Two humans talking together is powerful.
[03:56:29.437 --> 03:56:29.698]  Yeah.
[03:56:29.718 --> 03:56:33.020]  Like the Bible says, what two of you agree on on earth is done in heaven.
[03:56:34.747 --> 03:56:36.788]  Yeah, okay, well, you guys are great.
[03:56:37.428 --> 03:56:37.928]  Thank you, brother.
[03:56:37.948 --> 03:56:39.068]  Appreciate your call.
[03:56:39.409 --> 03:56:41.729]  Let's talk to Stephen in Alabama.
[03:56:41.749 --> 03:56:43.190]  You're on the air with old Alabama.
[03:56:43.770 --> 03:56:45.170]  Hey there, Alex.
[03:56:45.731 --> 03:56:47.571]  The only man I've ever known that could out-talk me.
[03:56:47.591 --> 03:56:49.672]  Well, that's a bad thing.
[03:56:49.692 --> 03:56:51.552]  I have a bunch of babble, but go ahead.
[03:56:52.493 --> 03:56:54.473]  Yes, but you're doing a good job.
[03:56:54.913 --> 03:56:57.074]  Two statements real quick, and then I want to ask you a question.
[03:56:57.094 --> 03:57:02.216]  Number one, Zuckerberg, he's on a 50-state tour because he wants to see how other people live.
[03:57:04.341 --> 03:57:06.123]  Number two, you inspired me to stop drinking.
[03:57:07.004 --> 03:57:15.233]  I was going through about a gallon of vodka every day and a half, for about a year and a half, and by the grace of God, I have no permanent damage and I'm clean and sober.
[03:57:15.613 --> 03:57:17.015]  I didn't take your advice.
[03:57:18.957 --> 03:57:21.760]  Yes, and um, number three,
[03:57:22.671 --> 03:57:26.172]  Here in Alabama, we've had two consecutive bomb threats.
[03:57:26.413 --> 03:57:27.173]  One in January.
[03:57:27.573 --> 03:57:28.293]  One in February.
[03:57:28.333 --> 03:57:29.354]  The Jewish Community Center.
[03:57:29.914 --> 03:57:30.874]  I know a lot of these people.
[03:57:30.894 --> 03:57:31.875]  They're very conservative.
[03:57:32.335 --> 03:57:33.836]  But this is nationwide, Alex.
[03:57:35.176 --> 03:57:36.837]  It's from the East Coast to the West Coast.
[03:57:36.897 --> 03:57:38.117]  It's all been on the same day.
[03:57:39.298 --> 03:57:41.859]  But there's yet to be pinned a single suspect in it.
[03:57:41.959 --> 03:57:42.959]  Are you aware of that?
[03:57:43.440 --> 03:57:43.700]  Sure.
[03:57:43.740 --> 03:57:44.660]  Trump's talked about it.
[03:57:45.280 --> 03:57:46.661]  But what was your first question?
[03:57:46.681 --> 03:57:47.981]  That was what I wanted to comment on.
[03:57:48.842 --> 03:57:49.662]  Oh, Zuckerberg.
[03:57:49.702 --> 03:57:50.603]  He's on a 50-state tour.
[03:57:50.663 --> 03:57:50.863]  Oh, yeah.
[03:57:50.883 --> 03:57:51.563]  Let me comment on that.
[03:57:51.894 --> 03:57:54.076]  Look, Israel's a complex issue.
[03:57:54.096 --> 03:58:09.609]  A lot of the whole racial stuff where it's black, white, Jewish, Christian is false flags, but I think there's genuinely an anti-Jew, Semitic thing that just is like resonates with people because it makes them feel intellectual and there's a big Islamist funding of that.
[03:58:09.629 --> 03:58:15.154]  It becomes a distraction where they claim, you know, everything's run by the Jews, so we just kill all of them and everything will be fine.
[03:58:15.434 --> 03:58:16.175]  It's a distraction.
[03:58:17.756 --> 03:58:18.297]  Separately,
[03:58:19.650 --> 03:58:20.631]  You're talking about Zuckerberg.
[03:58:20.651 --> 03:58:27.794]  Of course he's on this turd to learn about humanity is, because he didn't think you'd just take Hawaiian's land and build a mansion on it, and they got pissed off.
[03:58:28.175 --> 03:58:31.496]  He's a big social justice warrior, but he's, you know, give me your land!
[03:58:31.556 --> 03:58:34.038]  I'm gonna build a big thousand acre thing, or 700 acre!
[03:58:34.498 --> 03:58:36.859]  You know, it's like, he's just a, he's a damn vampire.
[03:58:37.339 --> 03:58:39.661]  And psychopaths always want to learn how to be human.
[03:58:39.981 --> 03:58:45.704]  They always are trying to like, I have a puppy, I have candy, I got a little doll here, it's a load of crap.
[03:58:46.184 --> 03:58:48.787]  You know, because they can never take care of you.
[03:58:48.807 --> 03:58:50.288]  They can never give you a good deal.
[03:58:50.749 --> 03:58:53.291]  They can never actually do anything that's big.
[03:58:53.331 --> 03:58:54.612]  They tell you how liberal they are.
[03:58:54.893 --> 03:58:56.434]  They tell you how much they love you all day.
[03:58:56.814 --> 03:58:57.635]  But they're out to get you.
[03:58:57.935 --> 03:58:58.596]  So that's my answer.
[03:58:58.636 --> 03:58:59.137]  Go ahead, ladies.
[03:59:00.043 --> 03:59:03.185]  Well yeah, I think you're exactly right there.
[03:59:03.225 --> 03:59:13.371]  I mean, Mark Zuckerberg, if he's doing this, and like you were talking on Psychopaths, they do want to learn from people so that they can learn to better manipulate them.
[03:59:13.791 --> 03:59:18.114]  And if you notice, in social media, that's all about manipulating the mind.
[03:59:18.174 --> 03:59:23.197]  So he could be trying to figure out how better to manipulate people through social media.
[03:59:23.217 --> 03:59:23.698]  Well that's it.
[03:59:23.778 --> 03:59:26.543]  I mean, we're teleprompter free, they're teleprompter brain.
[03:59:26.863 --> 03:59:28.005]  And who's lower than the teleprompter?
[03:59:28.025 --> 03:59:28.466]  They are.
[03:59:29.027 --> 03:59:30.690]  A psychopath doesn't know how to act nice.
[03:59:30.730 --> 03:59:32.292]  They learn the mannerisms and do it.
[03:59:33.325 --> 03:59:44.374]  Whereas, I mean, I'm not saying I'm a perfect guy, but I mean, when I say I'm really mean, I mean, I, you know, I, it's like, I just, I just believe what I'm saying.
[03:59:44.414 --> 03:59:45.555]  It's like, it's will.
[03:59:45.635 --> 03:59:46.576]  It's so strong.
[03:59:46.976 --> 03:59:48.598]  And that's the opposite of who they are.
[03:59:48.658 --> 03:59:50.079]  So people want to say how great I am.
