[00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:19.804]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:22.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:34.203]  We are live on this Friday, April 21st edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:37.524]  Again, we have another huge broadcast waiting in the wings.
[00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:43.706]  In the final hour of the show, we have Michael Hever coming on, who is Nigel Farage's former press aide.
[00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:48.147]  Of course, we had the surprise announcement of a snap election in the United Kingdom.
[00:00:48.187 --> 00:00:56.309]  We have a massive election taking place in France, at least the first round of it, this coming Sunday with Marine Le Pen
[00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.932]  20% matched up against the establishment candidate Macron.
[00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.834]  20% matched up against the far-left candidate Melenchon.
[00:01:04.315 --> 00:01:04.775]  Also at 20%.
[00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:08.098]  All the polls are within the margin of error.
[00:01:08.338 --> 00:01:09.218]  It could go anyway.
[00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:11.280]  Of course, the final round is on May 7th.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.983]  So the two who win the first round get to go through to the final round.
[00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:18.485]  And what happened yesterday in Paris?
[00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:23.947]  No surprise to anyone, another jihadist terror attack.
[00:01:24.447 --> 00:01:40.574]  Now Donald Trump came out, and we're going to go to this clip in a second, hours after the attack and said it looks like a terrorist attack, after the police had said it was a terrorist attack, after the President of France, Francois Hollande, said that it was a terrorist attack.
[00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:42.575]  But Trump had the temerity.
[00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:50.119]  The temerity to come out and say that it was a terrorist attack hours after everybody knew it was a terrorist attack.
[00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:51.560]  Let's go to that Trump clip right now.
[00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:58.471]  Well, first of all, our condolences from our country to the people of France.
[00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.591]  Again, it's happening, it seems.
[00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:03.732]  I just saw it as I was walking in, so that's a terrible thing.
[00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:07.614]  And it's a very, very terrible thing that's going on in the world today.
[00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:11.695]  But it looks like another terrorist attack.
[00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:14.597]  What can you say?
[00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:15.517]  It just never ends.
[00:02:15.797 --> 00:02:19.299]  We have to be strong and we have to be vigilant and I've been saying it for a long time.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:30.284]  So there is Donald Trump again having the nerve to call a terrorist attack a terrorist attack hours after it happened, hours after we knew the details.
[00:02:30.344 --> 00:02:39.429]  The fact that he'd driven up behind the police car, waited until they were stationary, got out, shot them at point-blank range with a Kalashnikov rifle.
[00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.390]  But oh no, you can't say it's a terrorist attack.
[00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.550]  Let's just pretend it's, you know, maybe it's workplace violence.
[00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.731]  Maybe it's a white right-wing extremist.
[00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:49.311]  Who knows?
[00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:52.132]  Then wait until everybody's forgotten about it and move on.
[00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:54.472]  Let's go back to that headline up on In4Wars.com.
[00:02:54.873 --> 00:03:00.234]  Media against Gold's Trump for referring to Paris terrorist attack as a terrorist attack.
[00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:02.789]  Now this goes through AP.
[00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.356]  AP put out a tweet saying Trump calls Paris shooting terrorist attack.
[00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:09.819]  Paris police have not yet announced a motive.
[00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.485]  Well they hadn't announced a motive but they had announced that it was a terrorist attack.
[00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:15.474]  OK.
[00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:17.936]  Trump didn't even get into any motive.
[00:03:18.076 --> 00:03:20.478]  All he said was it looks like a terrorist attack.
[00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.882]  But God forbid anyone can... You can't even say Islamic terrorist attack.
[00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:26.563]  You can't even say terror attack anymore.
[00:03:26.843 --> 00:03:28.985]  I mean, that's how warped it's become.
[00:03:29.305 --> 00:03:34.709]  This is the same AP, remember, who on Monday after that Fresno shooting said,
[00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:45.576]  That the killer, who after he had gunned down three innocent people in Fresno, said Allah Akbar, but no, you can't say Allah Akbar, you can't report the truth of what he actually said.
[00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:50.718]  They changed it and said that the shooter had said, quote, God is great.
[00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.260]  They helpfully translated it.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.406]  Just to help everybody out with the understanding of what Allah Akbar means because nobody knows what it means right by now.
[00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:07.932]  It's only said by terrorists after every single terror attack but nobody knows what it means so the AP has to explain that to us.
[00:04:08.413 --> 00:04:14.278]  And now it's the AP taking Donald Trump to task for calling a terrorist attack a terrorist attack.
[00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.962]  After the President of France had called it a terrorist attack.
[00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:28.717]  MSNBC reporters, the article continues, couldn't hide their utter disdain that Trump would dare to suggest that a terrorist shooting was a likely terrorist attack.
[00:04:29.117 --> 00:04:30.659]  So you had Chuck Todd up there.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.803]  Saying that Trump was getting ahead of the facts despite the fact that the French police were already suggesting the incident was terrorism.
[00:04:39.263 --> 00:04:43.505]  The Daily Beast's Christopher Dickey doing exactly the same.
[00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:48.827]  Absolutely incredible that he's now on the rack for calling it a terrorist attack.
[00:04:49.187 --> 00:04:51.368]  When everybody else was saying it was a terrorist attack.
[00:04:51.388 --> 00:04:52.708]  We're going to get more into it.
[00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:59.631]  Going to get into how this is going to play into the French election with Marine Le Pen looking good to get to that second round.
[00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:01.572]  Alex Jones Show live in fours.com.
[00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:02.032]  We'll be back.
[00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:05.031]  Are your headphones spying on you?
[00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:08.273]  If you have a new pair of wireless Bose headphones, then probably.
[00:05:08.514 --> 00:05:14.959]  A lawsuit filed in Chicago accuses the sound giant Bose of violating the Wiretap Act and a variety of privacy laws.
[00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:23.406]  You see, the Bose headphones have an app which allows you more options, but this app also serves as a gateway to sharing your metadata to anyone, anywhere.
[00:05:23.786 --> 00:05:26.329]  You agree to terms and conditions on the Bose headphone app.
[00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:35.880]  They then send whatever data is collected via the app off to a San Francisco-based firm called Segment, which offers to collect all of your customer data and send it anywhere.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.643]  This court case, which is said to be worth millions, could
[00:05:38.643 --> 00:05:45.426]  We've set a precedent for other potential cases where companies are data mining their customers then selling or moving that data anywhere.
[00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:46.386]  Don't be naive.
[00:05:46.707 --> 00:05:48.667]  Bose is not the only company doing this.
[00:05:48.988 --> 00:05:56.291]  A similar lawsuit was settled last month for 3.75 million dollars by a sex toy maker called WeVibe.
[00:05:56.631 --> 00:06:00.393]  All those social media apps are monitoring this case closely.
[00:06:00.413 --> 00:06:02.774]  For InfoWars.com, I'm Owen Schroer.
[00:06:03.522 --> 00:06:11.306]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:21.450]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:25.712]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:06:25.732 --> 00:06:28.774]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:06:28.794 --> 00:06:30.295]  We now have George Soros
[00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:32.136]  As a goblin.
[00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:38.600]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.503]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:53.049]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right-hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.989]  It's powerful.
[00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.030]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.
[00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.051]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:06.894]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
[00:07:07.114 --> 00:07:08.815]  Minor words and his was action.
[00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.916]  His was what he's done to women.
[00:07:10.956 --> 00:07:16.637]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[00:07:16.858 --> 00:07:19.158]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[00:07:19.518 --> 00:07:24.440]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.700]  Four of them here tonight.
[00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:31.142]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[00:07:41.977 --> 00:07:44.719]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.041]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:07:47.702 --> 00:07:49.643]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:07:49.964 --> 00:07:54.167]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:57.650]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.312]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:08:09.463 --> 00:08:10.364]  You found it.
[00:08:10.685 --> 00:08:12.207]  The tip of the spear.
[00:08:12.728 --> 00:08:15.192]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:15.752 --> 00:08:19.698]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:08:23.743 --> 00:08:30.587]  So we've had 21 jihadist terror attacks in France since January 2015 alone.
[00:08:30.627 --> 00:08:32.748]  Since the Charlie Hebdo massacre.
[00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.711]  Six attacks in Paris in the last three years alone.
[00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:38.532]  And that's probably playing it down.
[00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:40.453]  There have probably been other individual incidents.
[00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:42.854]  Which, you know, come out later with terror attacks.
[00:08:42.894 --> 00:08:48.536]  But France is getting absolutely blitzed by these incidents almost on a monthly basis now.
[00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:50.437]  We had another one yesterday.
[00:08:50.697 --> 00:09:05.384]  One cop dead, three people injured after a known extremist who was on a watch list, and in fact I think they tried to put him in prison at one point, gunned down this cop, injured another, again, point-blank Kalashnikov shot.
[00:09:06.482 --> 00:09:07.483]  But Trump is bad.
[00:09:07.983 --> 00:09:12.468]  Trump is bad because he came out two hours after and said it looks like a terrorist attack.
[00:09:12.728 --> 00:09:18.934]  That's what we should be outraged about, not the fact that these friggin' attacks are happening on a monthly basis.
[00:09:19.314 --> 00:09:22.838]  Take Europe as a whole, it's almost on a bi-weekly basis now.
[00:09:23.038 --> 00:09:25.160]  But no, don't get upset about that.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.322]  Don't look into solutions about that.
[00:09:27.642 --> 00:09:30.545]  Get upset with Donald Trump because he said a terrorist attack
[00:09:30.825 --> 00:09:31.909]  Was a terrorist attack.
[00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:36.624]  Let's go to this Fox & Friends video about the mainstream media attacking Trump over this.
[00:09:37.734 --> 00:09:50.282]  Instead of focusing on the terror, the attack, and hitting one of the most famous cities in one of our, and possibly our, with no argument, inarguably our first ally, instead everyone starts focusing on Donald Trump.
[00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:53.745]  Why did he possibly jump to the conclusion that this is terror?
[00:09:53.785 --> 00:09:55.726]  That's not the way a president should be saying it.
[00:09:55.746 --> 00:10:00.669]  First of all, the president said, I give my condolences to the French people, and it looks like another terrorist attack.
[00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:01.350]  Here we go again.
[00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.012]  He said, it just never ends.
[00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:04.452]  Exactly.
[00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:05.693]  He's saying it looks like terror.
[00:10:05.713 --> 00:10:07.354]  He's not definitely calling it terror.
[00:10:07.834 --> 00:10:08.334]  At that point?
[00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:08.715]  That's right.
[00:10:08.815 --> 00:10:12.577]  And so the Associated Press tweeted out, almost instantaneously, this.
[00:10:23.362 --> 00:10:23.962]  Maybe he was right.
[00:10:24.382 --> 00:10:31.164]  Breaking, French prosecutors have opened a terrorism investigation into the Champs-Élysées attack on Paris police officers.
[00:10:31.424 --> 00:10:40.707]  Meanwhile, the same debate was happening over on MSNBC, where they just couldn't believe that the president would say, it looks like terror, when it looked like terror.
[00:10:41.437 --> 00:10:55.756]  And if you go back to the Infowars article which we had up before, media again scolds Trump for referring to Paris terrorist attack as terrorist attack, and you scroll down you can watch the MSNBC videos in that article where they're decrying Trump for calling it a terrorist attack.
[00:10:56.477 --> 00:11:02.901]  One of the quotes is from one of the MSNBC guests, quote, well the President is quick to declare it probably a terrorist attack.
[00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:05.503]  I think it's too soon to know whether that indeed is the case.
[00:11:05.523 --> 00:11:10.606]  If it turns out that it's not terrorism, I think the White House is going to have some explaining to do.
[00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:16.990]  Again, this was after the President of France had come out and said this is a terrorist attack.
[00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.312]  After the police had said it was a terrorist attack.
[00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:23.474]  The basic circumstances of what happened tell you it's a terrorist attack.
[00:11:23.775 --> 00:11:29.419]  It happened in Paris, which has constantly been blitzed, bombarded with terrorist attacks.
[00:11:29.979 --> 00:11:31.080]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:42.708]  They had another contributor on this MSNBC program, Daily Beast editor Christopher Dickey, who launched into an in-depth analysis that pinpointed everything apart from terrorism as the problem.
[00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:51.476]  And so, he didn't talk about the fact that we've had 21 jihadist attacks in France since January 2015, six in Paris alone in the past three years.
[00:11:51.797 --> 00:11:56.761]  He didn't talk about this huge problem about ghettoization of Islamists, basically.
[00:11:57.301 --> 00:12:00.484]  He talked about how Marine Le Pen is a racist.
[00:12:00.944 --> 00:12:02.185]  Well, imagine my shock.
[00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:08.670]  Dickey lamented that the latest attack would embolden Le Pen's anti-Muslim, very anti-immigrant campaign.
[00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:09.350]  So again,
[00:12:10.165 --> 00:12:19.471]  They're more concerned about hurt feelings and lost votes than France being hit by terror attacks on an almost monthly basis at this point.
[00:12:20.492 --> 00:12:25.395]  This huge migrant crisis which you see there, you know, I visited France after the massacre in November 2015.
[00:12:25.795 --> 00:12:32.740]  In between that point and December 2015 you could see the difference just in that, you know, year gap.
[00:12:33.729 --> 00:12:37.932]  There's mattresses on the streets, there are migrants wandering around everywhere.
[00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:40.795]  You think this is restricted to the Calais migrant camp?
[00:12:41.315 --> 00:12:41.856]  No way!
[00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:46.640]  You've got riots on the streets happening now on an almost monthly basis.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.441]  This is a huge problem!
[00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:59.050]  Massive problem, not just with terrorist attacks, but again with the march through the institutions, the growth of Sharia law, the ghettoization of these communities.
[00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.411]  Let's not forget
[00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:03.795]  That the Paris Massacre...
[00:13:05.067 --> 00:13:09.268]  Butcher, basically Abdeslam, escaped into Belgium after the attack.
[00:13:09.628 --> 00:13:10.608]  He was shielded.
[00:13:11.008 --> 00:13:17.510]  He was hidden by members of his own community after he'd just been involved in the massacre of 200 plus people.
[00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.130]  They didn't turn him in.
[00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:20.810]  They sheltered him.
[00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.171]  They gave him protection.
[00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:23.051]  What was it?
[00:13:23.091 --> 00:13:24.751]  For months and months after the attack.
[00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:26.571]  That's what we need to be talking about.
[00:13:27.352 --> 00:13:33.193]  Rooting out the source of this radicalisation and why these terrorists are being protected in their own communities.
[00:13:33.233 --> 00:13:33.553]  But no.
[00:13:34.824 --> 00:13:40.726]  What we should be upset about is Donald frigging Trump saying that it's terrorism when it's obviously terrorism.
[00:13:41.206 --> 00:13:43.047]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:13:43.767 --> 00:13:50.990]  You have, you know, people barreling trucks into children in Nice, shooting officers at point-blank range.
[00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.010]  That's not extreme, is it?
[00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:53.231]  No.
[00:13:53.331 --> 00:13:59.933]  What's extreme is Maureen Le Pen's policies because she's a racist, because she actually wants to address this problem.
[00:14:01.636 --> 00:14:08.922]  Why do they think that she's so popular, even with all the demonization, the character assassination?
[00:14:09.162 --> 00:14:14.467]  Because she's the only candidate that's actually proposed policies to deal with this.
[00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:20.212]  Then you look at Macron, and we had that headline we just flashed up there, we can go back to it, this is out of Breitbart.
[00:14:21.718 --> 00:14:26.381]  French presidential favourite Macron, terrorism part of our daily lives for years to come.
[00:14:27.202 --> 00:14:36.308]  This is the exact same rhetoric we heard out of French Prime Minister Manuel Valls after the Nice truck attack.
[00:14:37.248 --> 00:14:42.132]  Where he said, French people will just have to learn to live with terrorism.
[00:14:42.372 --> 00:14:46.855]  It's the exact same rhetoric of complete submission and capitulation.
[00:14:48.092 --> 00:15:03.707]  Emmanuel Macron, the current favourite to win the French presidential election, who by the way is a fake populist and was literally created four years ago by Francois Hollande's team, literally cultivated in the lab there in the Elysee Palace in Paris.
[00:15:04.688 --> 00:15:09.929]  Total establishment candidate, Rothschild banker, yet they tried to sell him as a populist.
[00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.851]  French people are finally beginning to realise that he's just another establishment dupe.
[00:15:16.571 --> 00:15:21.313]  That he's another fake Barack Obama, which is why Obama endorsed him, which we're going to get onto.
[00:15:21.773 --> 00:15:30.095]  But Macron, the current favourite, has described terrorism as an imponderable problem which will be, quote, part of our daily lives for years to come.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:49.028]  Speaking to The Guardian, imagine my shock, the centre-left leader of En Marche candidate appeared to echo former Prime Minister Manuel Valls controversial statements following the Nice lorry attack on Bastille Day 2016, in which a Tunisian migrant mowed down 434 men, women and children, killing 87.
[00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:55.044]  Now this is what Val said at the time, remember this, we reported on it.
[00:15:55.384 --> 00:15:58.286]  This is what Val said after Nice, their Prime Minister.
[00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:01.649]  Times have changed and we should learn to live with terrorism.
[00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:09.635]  Learn to live with trucks barrelling down tourist thoroughfares, mowing down little kids.
[00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:10.876]  Just live with it.
[00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.117]  Just accept it.
[00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.058]  Just put up with it.
[00:16:14.078 --> 00:16:15.740]  Are you going to change your policies allowing
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.903]  Millions of these people in, who share some of the same beliefs.
[00:16:19.963 --> 00:16:22.826]  Again, 20% of Syrian migrants support ISIS.
[00:16:24.248 --> 00:16:26.690]  Here you see Antifa on the streets of Paris.
[00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:33.117]  They had signs, some of them expressing support for terrorists, which we've seen before.
[00:16:33.157 --> 00:16:34.999]  We've even seen that in America with Antifa.
[00:16:37.148 --> 00:16:46.984]  What did I warn about when ISIS came out with that manual back a year ago saying that they would try to recruit far-left agitators because they broadly share the same goals?
[00:16:49.696 --> 00:16:57.882]  Again, militant Antifa radicals who openly use violence to further their political aims and are proud about it.
[00:16:58.302 --> 00:16:59.243]  That's terrorism!
[00:16:59.303 --> 00:17:01.164]  That's a very definition of terrorism.
[00:17:01.825 --> 00:17:06.068]  There you see it, Gateway Pundit, ISIS calls the terror lines with radical leftists to conquer Rome.
[00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:10.831]  Dabiq, the official ISIS magazine, we reported on it at the time.
[00:17:11.752 --> 00:17:13.934]  They said these people share the same beliefs.
[00:17:14.014 --> 00:17:16.695]  We need to start radicalising them.
[00:17:16.716 --> 00:17:18.357]  We need to start giving them weapons.
[00:17:19.437 --> 00:17:20.917]  Now they're on the streets of Paris.
[00:17:20.937 --> 00:17:27.699]  500 euros it costs to get an AK-47 on the streets of Paris within hours.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.381]  To conduct massacres like the Paris Massacre and nothing is being done.
[00:17:34.781 --> 00:17:35.321]  Macron.
[00:17:35.901 --> 00:17:36.301]  Fillon.
[00:17:36.461 --> 00:17:45.503]  Fillon, supposedly the conservative candidate, the hardline security guy, gets up and rambles about terrorism for 20 minutes, offers absolutely no solution.
[00:17:46.103 --> 00:17:46.623]  Macron.
[00:17:47.244 --> 00:17:48.784]  Says we're just going to have to live with it.
[00:17:50.188 --> 00:17:52.850]  Mélenchon, the far-left candidate, is even worse.
[00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.732]  But who's got an actual policy to deal with it?
[00:17:56.293 --> 00:17:57.453]  Marine Le Pen.
[00:17:58.734 --> 00:18:03.758]  Headline, Marine Le Pen restore France's border and expel foreigners on watchlists.
[00:18:04.338 --> 00:18:07.541]  Again, the guy who carried out the attack yesterday was on one of these watchlists.
[00:18:07.581 --> 00:18:15.567]  In the wake of Thursday's terror attack, presidential candidate Marine Le Pen called for France to immediately expel all foreigners on watchlists and reinstate their borders.
[00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:26.527]  She said, as elected President of La Republique, I would immediately and with no hesitation carry out the battle plan against Islamist terrorism and against judicial laxity.
[00:18:26.987 --> 00:18:29.769]  The sympathisers of Islamists should be fought.
[00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:31.950]  For ten years we have seen this happening.
[00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:40.635]  Le Pen said the release of terrorist Kareem Jarafi by state prosecutors is, quote, the symbol of the failure of politics in this country.
[00:18:41.796 --> 00:18:43.417]  They had the guy.
[00:18:44.038 --> 00:18:46.059]  He was on an extremist watch list.
[00:18:47.076 --> 00:18:51.198]  You know, he was arrested before for plotting to attack police.
[00:18:51.658 --> 00:18:54.820]  That's exactly what he did in this instance.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.962]  But again, Emmanuel Macron says, just learn to live with it.
[00:19:00.242 --> 00:19:05.005]  Learn to live with terrorism on the streets of France, on the streets of Europe.
[00:19:06.405 --> 00:19:12.328]  He also says, they see Sky News, what we know about Sean's Lise Gumman as Paris home raided.
[00:19:12.428 --> 00:19:13.909]  Again, they had him on the watch list.
[00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:21.457]  He'd previously been flagged as an extremist to authorities and had a conviction for shooting at two police officers.
[00:19:21.517 --> 00:19:26.226]  He carried out, tried to carry out this exact same attack before.
[00:19:27.537 --> 00:19:34.982]  The man suspected of carrying out the Shons-Lizé attack was detained and freed in February for threatening to kill police.
[00:19:35.562 --> 00:19:36.823]  Absolutely insane.
[00:19:37.123 --> 00:19:41.205]  Marine Le Pen says we need to deport these people on watch lists.
[00:19:41.325 --> 00:19:46.328]  If they're French citizens, we need to put them in prison, not let them go over and over again.
[00:19:46.729 --> 00:19:49.951]  But Emmanuel Macron, the establishment candidate, says French people
[00:19:50.771 --> 00:19:52.852]  Just have to put up with it and shut up.
[00:19:53.593 --> 00:19:55.534]  We'll be back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:55.734 --> 00:19:57.255]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:57.435 --> 00:19:58.656]  Don't go away.
[00:20:04.279 --> 00:20:09.602]  The reason InfoWars Live has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:20:09.762 --> 00:20:10.343]  I take this.
[00:20:10.603 --> 00:20:11.644]  My family takes this.
[00:20:11.724 --> 00:20:15.966]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:20:16.026 --> 00:20:20.229]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:20:20.609 --> 00:20:25.171]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:20:25.251 --> 00:20:26.292]  I don't feel good.
[00:20:26.372 --> 00:20:29.893]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:20:30.133 --> 00:20:32.774]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:20:32.834 --> 00:20:38.137]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:20:38.617 --> 00:20:41.018]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:20:41.598 --> 00:20:45.040]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.301]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:47.721]  I love it.
[00:20:47.881 --> 00:20:50.484]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:51.645]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:57.631]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:20:57.651 --> 00:20:59.273]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:20:59.533 --> 00:21:01.535]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:21:05.285 --> 00:21:07.086]  This is Thomas Friedman, New York Times.
[00:21:07.146 --> 00:21:09.487]  He writes that Trump should not fight ISIS.
[00:21:10.668 --> 00:21:17.292]  Quote, the same way we encouraged the Mujahideen fighters to bleed Russia in Afghanistan.
[00:21:17.692 --> 00:21:24.676]  So you have a major New York Times writer openly calling for Trump to leave ISIS alone.
[00:21:24.696 --> 00:21:30.519]  I mean, Lionel, why is the establishment, which after all, you know, embraced this attack on Assad last week,
[00:21:31.059 --> 00:21:31.759]  They loved it!
[00:21:32.179 --> 00:21:38.901]  They immediately forgave Trump for many of his sins in the immediate aftermath of this Tomahawk missile attack.
[00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:46.403]  Why are they now openly encouraging him to allow the spread of a jihadist army that has terrorized an entire continent?
[00:21:47.243 --> 00:21:51.844]  Well, let me see if I can give you an adult and a cogent answer, because they're stupid!
[00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:55.786]  Because Americans are, no, no, stupid!
[00:21:56.467 --> 00:21:59.609]  Don't read, don't care, don't wonder.
[00:21:59.629 --> 00:22:01.090]  They're incurious.
[00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.332]  They know more about sports.
[00:22:03.392 --> 00:22:10.016]  They knew more about Tom Brady's under-inflated footballs than they do what's going on.
[00:22:10.256 --> 00:22:19.102]  In this article, he basically admits and explains that ISIS is a tool, a tool.
[00:22:19.182 --> 00:22:20.663]  He writes in there,
[00:22:21.724 --> 00:22:23.306]  That basically is an inside job.
[00:22:23.366 --> 00:22:25.088]  It's basically like professional wrestling.
[00:22:25.108 --> 00:22:27.271]  And nobody says anything!
[00:22:28.251 --> 00:22:29.291]  This was a test.
[00:22:29.692 --> 00:22:33.393]  This was to say, my God, do they read us?
[00:22:33.813 --> 00:22:34.894]  Do they care about us?
[00:22:35.214 --> 00:22:36.694]  Is anybody paying attention to us?
[00:22:36.854 --> 00:22:38.375]  Or do they just not know?
[00:22:38.395 --> 00:22:41.996]  I mean, Paul, I'm still reeling from that.
[00:22:42.517 --> 00:22:48.919]  I can't believe he was allowed to say that, frame that.
[00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:53.461]  That is the blueprint of what's going on.
[00:22:53.741 --> 00:22:55.182]  This is amazing.
[00:22:55.302 --> 00:22:55.742]  And also,
[00:22:56.642 --> 00:22:58.727]  I was doing a radio show this morning, to give an example.
[00:22:59.188 --> 00:23:01.333]  And I'm sure you've done this too, because people think I'm nuts!
[00:23:02.014 --> 00:23:07.225]  Could be for different reasons, but I say, well, you do realize that there are a lot of people, myself included...
[00:23:08.277 --> 00:23:12.258]  Who believed that the whole gas act was basically a false flag.
[00:23:12.938 --> 00:23:16.500]  That it was contrived, it was staged, it was orchestrated, as it was in 2013.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.721]  CYHR said this, we have evidence of this, we know it, it's part of their MO.
[00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:22.561]  And you could hear the crickets!
[00:23:22.621 --> 00:23:24.322]  It was like somebody said, cue the crickets!
[00:23:24.362 --> 00:23:26.182]  And I said, did you hear what I said?
[00:23:26.523 --> 00:23:27.743]  Where the hell have you been?
[00:23:28.323 --> 00:23:30.124]  Paul, am I living in a parallel universe?
[00:23:30.324 --> 00:23:36.967]  Have you and Alex and others deluded me into thinking that somehow everybody knows what we know?
[00:23:37.347 --> 00:23:43.909]  Am I walking around in some kind of a cosmic psychotic fugue where... am I the only one?
[00:23:44.329 --> 00:23:45.770]  I'm not talking to a guy in a corner.
[00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:53.773]  I'm talking to a newspaper, a radio host who says, well, did you see the pictures of the dead babies?
[00:23:53.793 --> 00:23:55.054]  And the guy says, yes!
[00:23:56.995 --> 00:23:58.655]  That's the thing, Lionel, over and over again.
[00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:01.817]  It's this appeal to sentimentality and emotion.
[00:24:13.103 --> 00:24:15.304]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913.
[00:24:20.106 --> 00:24:26.551]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:31.896]  Reuters is reporting note defending Islamic State found next to body of Paris attacker.
[00:24:32.336 --> 00:24:33.978]  That's coming from a judicial source.
[00:24:34.078 --> 00:24:43.626]  Investigators found a written note defending Islamic State next to the body of the gunman who shot dead a policeman in Paris on Thursday, a judicial source said.
[00:24:43.926 --> 00:24:45.807]  The hardline militant group claimed the attack
[00:24:46.468 --> 00:24:50.451]  Which also wounded two other police officers, so they found the note right next to him.
[00:24:51.391 --> 00:24:57.215]  The police came out and said, I was following it live on Twitter before Trump gave his speech.
[00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:58.796]  They said it was a terrorist attack.
[00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:02.459]  Before Trump gave his speech, Hollande came out and said it was a terrorist attack.
[00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:05.461]  But Donald Trump is bad for saying it's a terrorist attack.
[00:25:05.641 --> 00:25:06.742]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:25:07.202 --> 00:25:09.724]  Now Sky News is reporting the response to this.
[00:25:10.865 --> 00:25:11.746]  Paris shooting.
[00:25:11.766 --> 00:25:15.751]  50,000 troops and police mobilised after Shonzelezi attack.
[00:25:16.312 --> 00:25:19.055]  More than 50,000 police and soldiers have been fully mobilised.
[00:25:19.736 --> 00:25:22.479]  Probably were already, given that it's happening virtually every week now.
[00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:27.325]  After the killing of a police officer in Paris and days before the country's presidential election.
[00:25:28.366 --> 00:25:41.478]  So, they've got 50,000 troops out on the streets again, but they're still going to be importing hundreds of thousands of these people who then ghettoise into these Islamist no-go areas and continue the radicalisation.
[00:25:41.818 --> 00:25:43.139]  That's not going to be addressed.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.064]  Not if Macron wins at any rate, but no, they've got 50,000 troops out on the streets.
[00:25:49.363 --> 00:25:53.367]  You know, yeah, arm the police, but bullets aren't going to stop an ideology.
[00:25:53.387 --> 00:25:55.209]  You have to get to the root of the ideology.
[00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:59.054]  You have to elect someone who has actual policies to address it.
[00:26:00.475 --> 00:26:02.097]  And that's Marine Le Pen.
[00:26:02.978 --> 00:26:05.160]  This is up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.101]  Le Pen responds.
[00:26:06.522 --> 00:26:09.064]  Shut down Paris mosques to stop terror.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:21.966]  French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has called for a crackdown on terrorism in her country with a specific focus on Islamists and foreigners with terror ties and the expulsion of radical imams and the closure of Islamic mosques.
[00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:25.647]  She has an actual policy to deal with it.
[00:26:25.867 --> 00:26:31.910]  She has a policy to deal with it in terms of prison radicalisation, which is where a lot of this happens as well.
[00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.411]  It happens in the schools.
[00:26:34.031 --> 00:26:38.676]  You had a poll out of France a few weeks ago, we did an article on it.
[00:26:39.517 --> 00:26:44.982]  I think it was upwards of, what was it, a third of Muslim students in these schools support terrorism.
[00:26:46.183 --> 00:26:52.490]  33% support violent actions to further a political goal, the very definition of terrorism.
[00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:57.294]  So it's not just about the mosques, it's about the kids at the educational level.
[00:26:57.975 --> 00:26:59.316]  are being brainwashed with this.
[00:26:59.857 --> 00:27:00.798]  Absolutely insane.
[00:27:01.138 --> 00:27:04.942]  You're not just going to stop it by putting armed soldiers on the streets.
[00:27:05.843 --> 00:27:08.205]  This is the march through the institutions.
[00:27:08.885 --> 00:27:15.251]  As soon as you get past 6-7% Muslim population in France, you start to have problems.
[00:27:15.612 --> 00:27:17.453]  It happens in every European country.
[00:27:17.494 --> 00:27:18.695]  It's happening in Sweden.
[00:27:19.776 --> 00:27:21.637]  But what's Emmanuel Macron's solution?
[00:27:21.657 --> 00:27:22.859]  Well, this is out of Sputnik.
[00:27:23.786 --> 00:27:28.029]  Macron supports strikes against alleged chemical weapons storage in Syria.
[00:27:28.309 --> 00:27:32.472]  So he wants to bomb the people who are fighting ISIS.
[00:27:33.112 --> 00:27:41.778]  He wants to bomb the people who are fighting the terrorists who are committing acts of murder on the streets of Paris on a regular basis.
[00:27:42.078 --> 00:27:43.379]  That's his solution.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.341]  That's the establishment candidate, Emmanuel Macron.
[00:27:46.641 --> 00:27:49.643]  He wants to bomb the people who are fighting ISIS.
[00:27:50.512 --> 00:27:54.555]  He said, quote, I am ready for us to take on our responsibilities under the UN mandate.
[00:27:54.795 --> 00:27:58.198]  That is to say, targeted strikes to destroy stocks of chemical weapons in Syria.
[00:27:58.738 --> 00:28:02.521]  Macron said on France 2 TV late last night.
[00:28:03.422 --> 00:28:05.003]  Macron remains in the lead.
[00:28:05.043 --> 00:28:06.124]  He's still in the lead.
[00:28:06.164 --> 00:28:09.026]  He's still fooling people with this fake populist act.
[00:28:10.467 --> 00:28:17.632]  Now calling to bomb Bashar al-Assad's, quote, chemical stockpiles, which he supposedly relinquished back in 2013.
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.822]  No independent investigation of this chemical weapons attack that happened a few weeks ago.
[00:28:24.162 --> 00:28:30.004]  We know in the past the rebels were given the weapons by Saudi Arabia, mishandled them.
[00:28:30.404 --> 00:28:31.485]  That happened in Ghouta.
[00:28:32.285 --> 00:28:38.787]  Robert Parry, all these top experts, Seymour Hersh, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, came out and said the rebels staged that attack.
[00:28:39.247 --> 00:28:40.548]  Did they stage this attack?
[00:28:41.758 --> 00:28:50.287]  Again, we haven't got answers to that, but Macron, the establishment candidate, is just out saying we need to bomb the people who are fighting ISIS.
[00:28:50.647 --> 00:28:57.354]  That is his solution to these massacres that are happening on a bi-weekly basis now, almost, across Europe.
[00:28:58.677 --> 00:29:04.800]  They're going to continue to happen if you follow the same disastrous policies of capitulation and submission.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:21.068]  I mean, I've got an image posted on my Twitter account and I sent it, if you can flash it up, of a guy walking down a street in France, draped in an ISIS flag, just walking down the street nonchalantly, in France, you can see the signs in France, it's on my Twitter if you want to pull it up.
[00:29:22.168 --> 00:29:23.449]  Again, nobody seems to care.
[00:29:24.741 --> 00:29:25.982]  People are just in the cafe.
[00:29:26.182 --> 00:29:27.003]  Look, there it is!
[00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:28.424]  That is France!
[00:29:29.205 --> 00:29:32.428]  Draped in an ISIS flag, just casually walking down the street.
[00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:33.950]  Nobody says a word.
[00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.232]  It happened in London, in Westminster.
[00:29:36.252 --> 00:29:37.313]  They questioned the guy.
[00:29:37.813 --> 00:29:38.434]  Let him go!
[00:29:40.636 --> 00:29:44.760]  If somebody was draped in a Nazi flag walking down the street, would anyone say anything?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.881]  Absolutely insane.
[00:29:45.901 --> 00:29:49.464]  We'll be back with more on the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[00:29:49.484 --> 00:29:50.025]  Don't go away.
[00:29:52.199 --> 00:29:55.180]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.881]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.283 --> 00:30:13.186]  UC Berkeley, which has been the battleground for free speech, has cancelled conservative commentator Ann Coulter's speaking event, citing safety concerns.
[00:30:13.366 --> 00:30:18.088]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short notice,
[00:30:18.268 --> 00:30:25.934]  For a later date on May 2nd, which would be during Dead Week, when students are not even in class as they prep for finals.
[00:30:26.194 --> 00:30:37.843]  So essentially, Berkeley is appeasing the temper tantrum-throwing Antifa by canceling conservative speaker events that were properly invited by recognized student groups.
[00:30:38.063 --> 00:30:49.950]  The culture has stated that she plans to speak at Berkeley despite the cancellation and has criticized Berkeley's chief of police for allowing Rodney King-style riots to go on when only conservative speakers speak.
[00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:59.375]  Berkeley was known as the birthplace of the student-led free speech movement in the 1960s and now it's becoming the birthplace of student-led censorship.
[00:30:59.515 --> 00:31:02.377]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:03.337 --> 00:31:05.378]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:10.522]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:32:10.742 --> 00:32:17.168]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:32:17.388 --> 00:32:25.676]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:32:25.956 --> 00:32:34.707]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:32:34.987 --> 00:32:40.714]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:32:41.054 --> 00:32:41.514]  It works!
[00:32:41.814 --> 00:32:50.118]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.

[00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:09.753]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[00:33:09.813 --> 00:33:15.514]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.134 --> 00:33:19.855]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:28.268 --> 00:33:30.630]  And we are back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:36.674]  So again we had MSNBC up there railing on Donald Trump for daring to say this was a terrorist attack.
[00:33:36.694 --> 00:33:43.959]  You had their guests on there saying that it was Marine Le Pen who was bad for her extremist rhetoric.
[00:33:43.999 --> 00:33:47.021]  It was Donald Trump who was bad for saying it was a terrorist attack.
[00:33:47.341 --> 00:33:50.624]  Everyone's bad apart from the actual terrorists that carried out the attack.
[00:33:51.451 --> 00:33:53.572]  No, let's not analyse that ideology.
[00:33:53.612 --> 00:33:55.894]  Let's analyse Marine Le Pen's ideology.
[00:33:56.174 --> 00:33:59.536]  The only candidate who has actual policies to address this.
[00:33:59.936 --> 00:34:01.477]  Let's put her on the rack.
[00:34:02.278 --> 00:34:04.059]  There you see Daily Beast doing the same thing.
[00:34:04.099 --> 00:34:05.760]  That's all they're bothered about, the votes.
[00:34:06.809 --> 00:34:08.630]  In fact, Sky News went further.
[00:34:09.031 --> 00:34:14.595]  They even suggested that it could have been a, you know, a white right winger false flagging this attack.
[00:34:14.655 --> 00:34:18.958]  It's not a conspiracy theory when they say it, by the way, to help Marine Le Pen.
[00:34:19.278 --> 00:34:21.720]  So we have absolute insanity in the aftermath.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.644]  You know, ostrich stick your head in the sand behavior again and again and again.
[00:34:26.964 --> 00:34:27.645]  People saying, oh,
[00:34:28.405 --> 00:34:29.546]  We're so courageous.
[00:34:29.606 --> 00:34:31.748]  We're going to just continue with life as normal.
[00:34:31.768 --> 00:34:33.529]  We're going to walk down the street as normal.
[00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.772]  Because the terrorists won't change our way of life.
[00:34:36.812 --> 00:34:38.553]  Well, they already have changed your way of life.
[00:34:38.853 --> 00:34:40.475]  It's the march through the institutions.
[00:34:40.535 --> 00:34:41.936]  It's not just the terror attack.
[00:34:42.256 --> 00:34:45.319]  You can't just stick your head in the sand and hope it goes away.
[00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:51.444]  You don't change society by turning it into a police state, by putting a prison camp around Paris.
[00:34:51.905 --> 00:35:09.242]  You change it by cutting off the evil ideology at the source, which is Islamism, which is what Emmanuel Macron, the establishment candidate, has embraced basically by saying, we're just going to live with this, this is a routine part of our lives by now.
[00:35:10.711 --> 00:35:15.794]  Calling for the people in Syria fighting ISIS to be attacked.
[00:35:15.994 --> 00:35:17.855]  Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian army.
[00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:20.016]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:35:20.376 --> 00:35:21.357]  Now of course we have the whole...
[00:35:22.185 --> 00:35:26.168]  Russia interfered in the US election narrative which ran for months and months and months.
[00:35:26.728 --> 00:35:31.931]  That seems to have died down now in the aftermath of the bombing of Syria, the Tomahawk missile attacks.
[00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:43.578]  But again, the narrative was established, foreign interference in elections, outside interference in foreign elections, is terrible, it's reprehensible, we should really stop that.
[00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:47.241]  But what is Barack Obama doing yet again?
[00:35:48.081 --> 00:35:50.862]  He's interfering in a foreign election.
[00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:57.823]  Of course, he tried to interfere in Brexit, got up with David Cameron, gave a speech, tried to manipulate people that way.
[00:35:58.183 --> 00:36:02.864]  Now he's interfering in the French election to stop populist Marine Le Pen.
[00:36:03.264 --> 00:36:09.945]  He had a nice little friendly call and an endorsement for the establishment candidate Emmanuel Macron.
[00:36:09.985 --> 00:36:11.066]  In fact, we have that clip.
[00:36:11.106 --> 00:36:12.206]  Let's roll that right now.
[00:36:12.226 --> 00:36:16.347]  I have President Barack Obama for you.
[00:36:16.387 --> 00:36:16.987]  Hold on one second.
[00:36:17.107 --> 00:36:17.727]  Thank you very much.
[00:36:19.414 --> 00:36:19.814]  Hello!
[00:36:20.234 --> 00:36:21.094]  Hello, Mr. President.
[00:36:21.154 --> 00:36:21.595]  How are you?
[00:36:21.615 --> 00:36:22.755]  Mr. Emmanuel?
[00:36:22.935 --> 00:36:23.215]  Yeah.
[00:36:24.495 --> 00:36:24.895]  Exactly.
[00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:26.576]  Well, I'm doing very well.
[00:36:27.196 --> 00:36:27.616]  How are you?
[00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:28.436]  Can you hear me?
[00:36:28.776 --> 00:36:29.997]  Yes, I hear you very well.
[00:36:31.157 --> 00:36:36.798]  The main message I have is to wish you all the best in the coming days.
[00:36:37.438 --> 00:36:41.239]  And make sure that, as you said, you work hard all the way through.
[00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:46.821]  Because you never know, it might be that last day of campaigning that... Yeah, I do agree.
[00:36:46.941 --> 00:36:47.641]  ...makes all the difference.
[00:36:48.610 --> 00:37:06.058]  I will do my best, believe me, and so I will fight to the last minute and we will keep in touch and our teams will lie in order to organize a new contact and see how to work together if I'm going to the runoff.
[00:37:06.278 --> 00:37:06.959]  Thank you very much.
[00:37:07.239 --> 00:37:09.260]  I do appreciate you took the time.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:09.780]  Good luck.
[00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:18.292]  So there you have it, Barack Obama endorsing the establishment candidate Macron, who again they tried to introduce as a populist.
[00:37:18.352 --> 00:37:22.114]  Remember Obama's hope and change back in 2007-2008?
[00:37:22.714 --> 00:37:25.536]  They tried to do the exact same thing with Macron.
[00:37:26.276 --> 00:37:34.761]  They tried to pretend that he was this authentic grassroots candidate, when in reality his whole campaign was hatched from within.
[00:37:35.811 --> 00:37:45.859]  The Alize Palace in the capital of France four years ago by Francois Hollande, who will endorse Macron if he makes it to the second round.
[00:37:46.299 --> 00:37:47.861]  Again, it's a two round runoff.
[00:37:48.341 --> 00:37:50.703]  Basically, Marine Le Pen has to win the first round.
[00:37:50.863 --> 00:37:53.746]  If she comes second, she's not going to have the momentum
[00:37:54.386 --> 00:37:57.189]  To carry her through to take the presidency.
[00:37:57.229 --> 00:37:59.871]  She has to come first in the first round.
[00:38:00.391 --> 00:38:02.413]  But again, it's a complete toss-up at this point.
[00:38:02.433 --> 00:38:06.717]  You have four major candidates, about all on 20% roughly.
[00:38:07.277 --> 00:38:09.199]  The polls are all within the margin of error.
[00:38:09.239 --> 00:38:11.001]  You have Macron, the establishment candidate.
[00:38:11.021 --> 00:38:13.083]  You have Le Pen, the nationalist.
[00:38:13.363 --> 00:38:19.909]  You have Mélenchon, the far leftist, who is the French Hugo Chavez, endorsed by the Communist Party.
[00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:30.754]  And you have Francois Fillon, the more establishment conservative, who again waffles on about security and terrorism, yet has offered no actual policies to deal with it.
[00:38:31.134 --> 00:38:33.995]  No forceful policies like Marine Le Pen.
[00:38:34.495 --> 00:38:36.235]  So this is absolutely huge.
[00:38:36.475 --> 00:38:43.497]  If Marine Le Pen wins, and of course they're saying, oh, she's going to be defeated in the second round easily, just like Brexit wouldn't happen, just like Trump wouldn't happen.
[00:38:43.917 --> 00:38:46.018]  If she wins, it could be the death knell.
[00:38:47.011 --> 00:38:48.152]  For the European Union.
[00:38:48.732 --> 00:38:53.594]  And now the analyst who predicted Trump's ascendancy bets on Le Pen's win.
[00:38:54.475 --> 00:38:55.555]  This is out of Bloomberg.
[00:38:55.615 --> 00:39:07.321]  Markets are underpricing the prospect of Marine Le Pen emerging victorious in the French election as a sea of undecided voters throws into sharp relief pronounced apathy for centre-leftist Emmanuel Macron.
[00:39:07.561 --> 00:39:12.284]  They're finally starting to figure out that he is basically the French Tony Blair.
[00:39:13.024 --> 00:39:18.970]  He's the frontrunner by a whisker right now, but there's a backlash brewing against the European Union project.
[00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:30.221]  That's a conclusion drawn by Charles Gave, who accurately predicted the triumph of Donald Trump in the US election and is now betting on a win for the anti-euro national front candidate.
[00:39:30.942 --> 00:39:37.028]  Quote, Le Pen's momentum is a slow-moving reaction against the men of Davos, as we have seen with Brexit and Trump.
[00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:44.336]  But markets don't want to believe it, he said by phone before the first round of the French poll on April 23rd, which is on Sunday.
[00:39:45.919 --> 00:39:51.203]  So a lot of those analysts were kind of discredited, weren't they, before the US election?
[00:39:51.883 --> 00:39:58.227]  A lot of the people who came out and said, no, the indications are the algorithms are showing that Donald Trump will sweep to victory.
[00:39:59.028 --> 00:40:07.814]  Meanwhile, on the flip side, you had the New York Times, the Huffington Post, you know, you saw the polls, you saw the tweets, Hillary Clinton, 95, 98% chance of winning.
[00:40:08.414 --> 00:40:15.539]  Meanwhile, if you actually look at these AI models, which were proven accurate when Donald Trump was elected months beforehand,
[00:40:16.519 --> 00:40:23.243]  Professors that have predicted successfully the winner of the US presidential election time and time again.
[00:40:23.664 --> 00:40:25.905]  They were all saying that Trump would win, they were proven right.
[00:40:26.165 --> 00:40:29.247]  Some of the same people are saying that Le Pen would win.
[00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:33.670]  But still, you have this narrative in the media, she can't win, she can't win.
[00:40:34.767 --> 00:40:35.327]  We will see.
[00:40:36.087 --> 00:40:39.968]  Will French people be kowtowed by this character assassination?
[00:40:40.008 --> 00:40:45.410]  I would say they're more likely to be manipulated by it, given the history of that country.
[00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:54.612]  Obviously what happened during the Second World War, it's more easy to taint her with that brush and discredit her campaign that way.
[00:40:54.652 --> 00:41:03.655]  We will see if that is successful, but at the moment the polls are showing absolute tied neck and neck in France between these four candidates.
[00:41:04.622 --> 00:41:13.327]  Now of course, before the terrorist attack yesterday in Paris, which was a terrorist attack, Donald Trump was right to call it a terrorist attack, we had another foiled terror plot.
[00:41:13.347 --> 00:41:14.548]  This is out of Breitbart.
[00:41:15.288 --> 00:41:18.790]  Front National, Le Pen was likely target of foiled terror plot.
[00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.091]  So this could have been connected.
[00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:30.637]  The article states, in the aftermath of the foiled terror plot against French presidential candidates, the anti-mass migration Front National have claimed Marine Le Pen may have been the target.
[00:41:31.497 --> 00:41:39.362]  In reaction to the foiled attacks, Republican Francois Fillon and Socialist Benoit Hamon have said they hope people will not be deterred from voting.
[00:41:39.382 --> 00:41:44.646]  Well, in fact, Fillon has said we should just suspend the election, at least at this point, which is insane.
[00:41:45.807 --> 00:41:51.891]  The Anti-Mass Migration National Front has claimed that their candidate, Marine Le Pen, was likely a target, a source from Le Pen's entourage.
[00:41:53.112 --> 00:41:57.675]  And remember, this happened in Holland with their election, with their right-wing candidate as well.
[00:41:59.028 --> 00:42:07.898]  A source told the paper the fact that two individuals were arrested in Marseilles while Marine Le Pen is holding a meeting on the next day is perhaps not a coincidence.
[00:42:08.899 --> 00:42:15.966]  A security source within the FN noted the Union of Islamic Organizations of France had singled out Le Pen as the candidate to be.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:40.069]  And yet you still see people on MSNBC, on Sky News, suggesting that Islamists are carrying out these attacks, even some suggesting that it's a false flag, but some saying Islamists are carrying out these attacks because they want Marine Le Pen to win, even though she's the only one whose policies will stop them getting into the country in the first place.
[00:42:41.127 --> 00:42:42.869]  Of course they don't want Marine Le Pen to win.
[00:42:43.149 --> 00:42:45.391]  They want the socialist soft touch.
[00:42:45.431 --> 00:43:01.604]  They want someone like Macron, who's basically embraced the fact that France is now going to have to live with terrorism for years and years to come, while saying that he will bomb, support a coalition bombing of the people in Syria who are actually fighting ISIS.
[00:43:01.844 --> 00:43:03.025]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:43:03.746 --> 00:43:06.267]  The election, the first round, is this Sunday.
[00:43:06.387 --> 00:43:07.268]  It's going to be huge.
[00:43:07.308 --> 00:43:09.469]  It's nationalism versus globalism.
[00:43:10.269 --> 00:43:14.851]  Axios reports how Trump and Brexit could predict the French elections.
[00:43:14.911 --> 00:43:17.993]  Again, another source saying, despite the narrative,
[00:43:18.936 --> 00:43:20.536]  But she has no chance in the second round.
[00:43:20.576 --> 00:43:21.257]  This could happen.
[00:43:21.817 --> 00:43:34.540]  Axios' Steve Levine, a long-time foreign correspondent for the big papers, sees a quote, better than 50-50 chance Le Pen goes all the way, based partly on the rule of threes following the upset victories for Trump and Brexit.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:46.203]  He said, quote, the first round is a tight race amongst four candidates and one of them, Jean-Luc Melenchon, who is the communist-backed Hugo Chavez of France, is every bit the firebrand as Le Pen.
[00:43:47.063 --> 00:43:48.023]  Only from the far left.
[00:43:48.063 --> 00:43:49.344]  So that's another possibility.
[00:43:50.384 --> 00:43:58.126]  Now Melenchon, for all his faults, he actually wants to reduce working hours in France from 35 hours a week to 32.
[00:43:58.766 --> 00:43:59.726]  If you can believe that.
[00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:02.647]  Because the French economy isn't anemic enough.
[00:44:03.467 --> 00:44:07.509]  French youth unemployment, which is at 25%, that's not high enough.
[00:44:07.569 --> 00:44:12.250]  We need to bump that up even more by instituting these more draconian work hours.
[00:44:13.547 --> 00:44:16.608]  He's bad on many issues, he's terrible, but on one issue he's good.
[00:44:16.648 --> 00:44:18.348]  Again, he wants to get out of the EU.
[00:44:18.388 --> 00:44:22.189]  He wants to have a Frexit, a French referendum exiting the EU.
[00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:26.410]  He's not a fan of the bureaucratic globalist European Union.
[00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:32.371]  So you could have a situation where Le Pen and Melenchon win the first round.
[00:44:32.471 --> 00:44:37.832]  They come 1-2 in whatever order, then they go on to face off in the second round on May 7th.
[00:44:38.172 --> 00:44:42.293]  So either way, you will get some kind of populist face-off.
[00:44:42.893 --> 00:44:46.479]  I mean, if you're being generous to Melenchon, you would say he was the French Bernie Sanders.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.483]  Other people call him the French Hugo Chavez.
[00:44:48.763 --> 00:44:52.028]  But at least you would have an actual, real fight.
[00:44:52.169 --> 00:44:54.513]  Two authentic candidates from the left and the right.
[00:44:55.882 --> 00:44:57.902]  But they're probably going to want Macron in there.
[00:44:58.162 --> 00:45:00.423]  So manipulation is happening right now.
[00:45:00.463 --> 00:45:11.105]  We had Facebook come out and Google come out, and I think I talked about this on Monday, said they would educate the French people on fake news and how they were being misled.
[00:45:11.445 --> 00:45:14.506]  Which of course means Google is going to change its algorithm.
[00:45:14.806 --> 00:45:19.687]  They're going to manipulate millions and millions of French people, undecided voters,
[00:45:20.307 --> 00:45:21.548]  There's a huge number of them.
[00:45:21.868 --> 00:45:27.091]  They're going to be manipulated in the crucial days and hours leading up to this vote.
[00:45:27.511 --> 00:45:31.693]  There you see how Bloomberg Facebook starts to educate users on how to spot fake news.
[00:45:32.754 --> 00:45:34.935]  They're just going to lend people a helping hand.
[00:45:35.635 --> 00:45:42.919]  Oh, and by the way, we've shut down 30,000 Facebook accounts, a lot of which were aligned with supporting Marine Le Pen.
[00:45:43.993 --> 00:45:45.193]  What a surprise that is.
[00:45:45.233 --> 00:45:48.634]  There you see YouTube offering fake news workshops to teenagers.
[00:45:48.654 --> 00:45:52.975]  We're going to get into that later because I know exactly the real agenda behind that.
[00:45:54.115 --> 00:45:55.295]  So this election is huge.
[00:45:55.335 --> 00:45:57.156]  It's nationalism versus globalism.
[00:45:57.476 --> 00:45:58.716]  First round on Monday.
[00:45:59.136 --> 00:46:00.036]  The terror attack.
[00:46:00.096 --> 00:46:01.497]  How will that affect voters?
[00:46:01.817 --> 00:46:04.197]  Terror attacks on an almost weekly basis in France.
[00:46:04.497 --> 00:46:05.598]  How will that affect voters?
[00:46:05.638 --> 00:46:07.338]  It's going to be massive.
[00:46:08.103 --> 00:46:14.827]  And in fact I've got a French political analyst coming in on Monday to talk about it, so we've got that to look forward to as well.
[00:46:15.667 --> 00:46:18.588]  Sticking in Europe though, Sweden.
[00:46:19.669 --> 00:46:21.550]  Did you hear about what happened last night in Sweden?
[00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:24.552]  Did you hear about what happens every night in Sweden?
[00:46:24.972 --> 00:46:30.195]  Riots, gang shootouts, people being kicked out of these Islamic ghetto areas.
[00:46:30.615 --> 00:46:31.435]  It's all going down.
[00:46:31.475 --> 00:46:34.237]  Of course we had the Stockholm terror attack a couple of weeks ago.
[00:46:35.097 --> 00:46:36.458]  Another truck attack.
[00:46:36.818 --> 00:46:38.979]  Thankfully, it wasn't as bad as it could have been.
[00:46:38.999 --> 00:46:45.041]  A brave individual swerved his vehicle in front of the truck, preventing further carnage.
[00:46:45.561 --> 00:46:49.083]  But now we have somebody who's put up a video, and we can flip to this in a second.
[00:46:50.704 --> 00:47:01.788]  They go into a rich area, a rich suburb of Sweden, and they start blaring out the call to prayer, the Islamic call to prayer, through the megaphone.
[00:47:03.869 --> 00:47:09.354]  The people don't know how to react, but again, most of them probably would capitulate at this point.
[00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:12.377]  It's actually surprising how a couple of these people do react.
[00:47:12.918 --> 00:47:18.383]  This is multiculturalism arrives at a rich Swedish neighbourhood, and I'll talk over it.
[00:47:18.443 --> 00:47:18.944]  Here's the clip.
[00:47:22.176 --> 00:47:25.578]  So they've driven up to this well-to-do Swedish neighborhood.
[00:47:26.158 --> 00:47:27.939]  They've got the loudspeakers on the trucks.
[00:47:27.959 --> 00:47:39.864]  They're blaring out the Islamic call to prayer to see how Swedes react, because Swedes are very welcoming of cultural enrichment, very welcoming of mass immigration.
[00:47:40.564 --> 00:47:43.545]  So this one guy responds, and bearing in mind this is like 6 a.m.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:46.206]  in the morning, and starts filming them on his phone.
[00:47:46.767 --> 00:47:48.927]  Good morning, bourgeois, standing there filming us.
[00:47:48.988 --> 00:47:49.808]  What is the problem?
[00:47:50.788 --> 00:47:56.632]  The guys with the loudspeakers ask, multiculturalism is here, you voted for it yourself, could it be that you are xenophobic?
[00:47:59.013 --> 00:48:01.214]  Are you against the multicultural society?
[00:48:01.995 --> 00:48:05.537]  Then a woman appears, what the bleep, it's 6 o'clock in the morning.
[00:48:06.317 --> 00:48:09.599]  Good morning, the multicultural society has arrived, you voted for it.
[00:48:13.759 --> 00:48:15.984]  She lets them know what she thinks about it.
[00:48:16.024 --> 00:48:20.534]  We will do everything in our power to open asylum accommodation on your street!
[00:48:22.745 --> 00:48:24.046]  This is a 6 a.m.
[00:48:24.707 --> 00:48:31.892]  broadcast call to prayer on a rich, well-to-do Swedish suburb, just to see how they respond to it.
[00:48:32.173 --> 00:48:38.578]  Bearing in mind, Islamists in London have called for this to be made legal, for them to broadcast this at 6 a.m.
[00:48:38.858 --> 00:48:39.859]  on the streets of London.
[00:48:40.399 --> 00:48:41.900]  So the police arrive, what is happening here?
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.722]  The multicultural society has arrived to these neighborhoods.
[00:48:45.343 --> 00:48:47.004]  Isn't it pleasant, the police say.
[00:48:47.465 --> 00:48:48.826]  The music is deserving the peace.
[00:48:49.406 --> 00:48:53.648]  They respond, this can happen with multiculturalism, sometimes it's disturbing.
[00:48:54.528 --> 00:49:01.471]  So it appears that Swedes aren't really fans of cultural enrichment when it comes to their doorstep.
[00:49:02.131 --> 00:49:14.996]  They're all good and well to virtue signal about it on Facebook and Twitter and hold up refugee welcome signs, but when you actually bring it to their doorstep, the reality of what that means, not so big fans of it.
[00:49:16.178 --> 00:49:32.278]  And again, we've covered the articles before in London, but these Islamic mosques in East London, which are basically 80-90% Muslim population at this point, they want the law to be changed so they can broadcast the Islamic call to prayer, just like you heard in that video, at 6am.
[00:49:34.485 --> 00:49:37.686]  Now some of the councils there have shown signs that they may back down on that.
[00:49:38.306 --> 00:49:39.207]  Will that happen?
[00:49:39.547 --> 00:49:46.410]  Will the streets of London actually wake up to the cultural enrichment of the Islamic call to prayer?
[00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:48.570]  Or will there be a backlash against that?
[00:49:49.071 --> 00:49:50.411]  As you saw there though in Sweden.
[00:49:51.231 --> 00:49:54.633]  The people in the well-to-do areas who are probably, you know, pro-immigration
[00:49:55.595 --> 00:50:05.218]  We've looked at the maps where the Swedish politicians live and they all live in the areas where no immigrants live and you can see that in the UK as well.
[00:50:05.558 --> 00:50:06.838]  I've made videos about it.
[00:50:07.438 --> 00:50:18.181]  All the people who virtue signal the most vehemently about mass immigration, about allowing quote refugees who aren't refugees, they're economic migrants into the country, none of them live
[00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:20.382]  In areas where there are immigrants.
[00:50:20.442 --> 00:50:25.046]  They live in the whitest areas of London because I live there and I know.
[00:50:25.446 --> 00:50:28.989]  They live in Richmond, they live in Barnes, they live in Hampstead.
[00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:32.852]  All these areas are 95 to 98% white.
[00:50:33.533 --> 00:50:40.718]  So they will virtue signal all day about how much they love mass immigration, cultural enrichment and allowing refugees into the country.
[00:50:41.599 --> 00:50:45.544]  So long as they're not living anywhere near them, because we can't have that, can we?
[00:50:46.304 --> 00:50:47.306]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:50:47.346 --> 00:50:52.612]  We will be back on the Alex Jones Show with more news breaking at infowars.com.
[00:50:53.152 --> 00:50:55.515]  Gonna get into the domestic picture here as well.
[00:50:56.156 --> 00:50:56.816]  Don't go away.
[00:50:57.377 --> 00:50:58.899]  Next segment coming up, infowars.com.
[00:51:07.924 --> 00:51:14.368]  Russia unveiled a Satan-2 missile that could wipe out France or Texas with the type of megaton weapons it carries.
[00:51:14.728 --> 00:51:15.709]  Multiple ones, by the way.
[00:51:15.969 --> 00:51:18.110]  Of course, there's a lot more advanced stuff than that.
[00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:26.616]  They admitted the Air Force, by the 90s, developed antimatter bombs that would destroy, if they theoretically tested them, they would destroy most of the solar system.
[00:51:27.516 --> 00:51:28.357]  What's the point of that?
[00:51:28.957 --> 00:51:29.298]  I don't know.
[00:51:29.898 --> 00:51:33.341]  But we're reaching that Atlantis moment, whether Atlantis existed or not.
[00:51:33.881 --> 00:51:38.425]  In the fable of Atlantis, the legend, they get some super technology that blows the whole island up.
[00:51:39.065 --> 00:51:41.487]  And Plato lived only, you know, a few thousand years after.
[00:51:41.527 --> 00:51:41.987]  He said no.
[00:51:42.288 --> 00:51:43.649]  He had the animals, the books about it.
[00:51:43.869 --> 00:51:44.249]  It happened.
[00:51:44.269 --> 00:51:47.291]  But whether that was real or not, folks, we're now at the Atlantis moment.
[00:51:47.612 --> 00:51:49.393]  Michael Snyder, you know, I don't know if you have kids.
[00:51:49.793 --> 00:51:51.815]  I have children, especially my little daughters.
[00:51:51.935 --> 00:51:55.738]  And I see this news, and I see how sweet they are, and it really makes me angry.
[00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:59.304]  Yeah, I don't want war either, Alex.
[00:51:59.384 --> 00:52:01.827]  And that's why I'm so alarmed by what's happened this week.
[00:52:01.867 --> 00:52:05.572]  We already talked about how North Korea could potentially spark a war with China.
[00:52:05.592 --> 00:52:08.816]  Well, the situation with Syria, if it was just Syria, wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[00:52:08.976 --> 00:52:11.660]  And Trump could do whatever he wanted if it was just Syria.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.082]  But the Russians are there!
[00:52:13.482 --> 00:52:18.086]  And the Russians are mixed in among the Syrian forces and they're at the Syrian air bases in particular.
[00:52:18.446 --> 00:52:27.654]  So Trump, with his words and the members of his administration in recent days, they've kind of committed themselves to taking some sort of action in response to this false flag chemical attack.
[00:52:27.934 --> 00:52:29.295]  But they've kind of committed themselves.
[00:52:29.335 --> 00:52:35.320]  But if they do anything, the bombs start dropping and the Russians, their people are being killed, their forces under threat.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.781]  Are the Russians just going to sit there and do nothing?
[00:52:38.101 --> 00:52:39.242]  Or are they going to respond?
[00:52:39.602 --> 00:52:41.163]  I believe the Russians would start responding.
[00:52:41.183 --> 00:52:42.304]  They would start shooting back.
[00:52:42.404 --> 00:52:44.905]  And so what happens if, okay, U.S.
[00:52:44.965 --> 00:52:50.228]  warplanes go in, they start bombing, and then Russian missiles, the S-300, starts taking U.S.
[00:52:50.308 --> 00:52:50.889]  airplanes out?
[00:52:50.909 --> 00:52:54.491]  We start seeing F-16s fall out of the sky on CNN.
[00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:59.774]  What's that going to do to the anti-Russian hysteria in Washington that's already at Cold War heights?
[00:53:00.134 --> 00:53:01.455]  I mean, it's just going to be insane.
[00:53:29.974 --> 00:53:31.475]  Yeah, Russia doesn't back down.
[00:53:31.515 --> 00:53:32.415]  Russia is not intimidated by anyone.
[00:53:32.435 --> 00:53:34.717]  The Russians, historically, are fighters.
[00:53:34.797 --> 00:53:42.621]  And so, you know, we had hoped that with Trump coming in, we could have a better relationship with Russia, but this thing with Syria could actually make it far, far worse.
[00:54:09.748 --> 00:54:10.996]  Yeah.
[00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:35.914]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show and I need to tell you about the specials at Infowarsstore.com because these products are going fast and again.
[00:54:35.934 --> 00:54:38.216]  We need your support now more than ever.
[00:54:38.236 --> 00:54:41.039]  You've seen we're under constant attack by the establishment.
[00:54:41.079 --> 00:54:41.899]  They were shocked!
[00:54:42.674 --> 00:54:43.815]  That Donald Trump won.
[00:54:43.855 --> 00:54:47.217]  Now the backlash is beginning and it's focused on us directly.
[00:54:47.978 --> 00:54:55.323]  We have extended Easter Mega Specials but we're quickly selling out of these products so it's time to stock up before it's all gone.
[00:54:56.023 --> 00:54:56.964]  Now let's get it clear.
[00:54:57.024 --> 00:54:59.285]  Supermail Vitality and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:55:00.126 --> 00:55:00.887]  We're good to go.
[00:55:25.482 --> 00:55:27.443]  25% off Secret 12 Vitamin B12.
[00:55:28.223 --> 00:55:30.445]  25% off Super Female Vitality.
[00:55:31.065 --> 00:55:33.427]  Again, 25% off Survival Shield X2.
[00:55:34.167 --> 00:55:44.914]  Those products aren't going to stick around for long because the others that were on offer are basically out of stock at this point, but we have extended the Easter Mega Special for a limited time only.
[00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:46.976]  These products will go quick again.
[00:55:48.328 --> 00:55:56.994]  Please support us right now, it's absolutely crucial at this time, given the constant hyper-focused assault we're under by the establishment.
[00:55:57.734 --> 00:56:05.599]  Now we have a review of the day here, another five-star independent review from somebody who got Brain Force Plus, which again is still available 30% off.
[00:56:07.366 --> 00:56:08.386]  This is from Frank.
[00:56:09.107 --> 00:56:10.607]  Again, independent five-star review.
[00:56:10.687 --> 00:56:12.268]  Another game-changing product.
[00:56:12.848 --> 00:56:15.670]  I take two when I know I'm going to have a challenging day.
[00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.591]  And they send me flying through it.
[00:56:18.171 --> 00:56:19.591]  That's exactly what I've experienced.
[00:56:19.651 --> 00:56:22.133]  I take two every day before I do this show again.
[00:56:22.833 --> 00:56:24.854]  On Monday, you know, two hours sleep, jet-lagged.
[00:56:25.514 --> 00:56:27.035]  Sent me flying through it as well.
[00:56:27.195 --> 00:56:29.796]  Absolutely incredible benefits.
[00:56:29.816 --> 00:56:33.758]  You get mental clarity, mental acuity, energy.
[00:56:34.864 --> 00:56:37.949]  Clear, focused thinking from Brain Force Plus.
[00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:45.261]  He goes on to say, Brain Force gives me the laser-like focus and elevated mood and memory recall that I've been searching for.
[00:56:45.361 --> 00:56:47.785]  Another game-changing product.
[00:56:48.993 --> 00:56:49.694]  And it works!
[00:56:49.914 --> 00:56:54.999]  I used to take stuff different to Brain Force, similar ingredients, but again, not as good.
[00:56:55.039 --> 00:56:59.143]  It kind of gave you a junk feeling, you know, the feeling that you've drunk too much coffee or whatever.
[00:56:59.683 --> 00:57:01.265]  Brain Force is completely clear.
[00:57:01.385 --> 00:57:01.925]  It's pure.
[00:57:01.965 --> 00:57:03.847]  It doesn't give you any of those bad side effects.
[00:57:04.227 --> 00:57:07.210]  Pot 2, absolute mental clarity.
[00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.775]  This will help you immeasurably with whatever task you're undertaking during that particular day.
[00:57:13.595 --> 00:57:14.876]  Frank swears by it again.
[00:57:14.956 --> 00:57:20.420]  Independent five star review still available for 30% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.582]  That Easter mega special extended for a limited time only.
[00:57:24.943 --> 00:57:26.444]  The other products are flying out.
[00:57:26.544 --> 00:57:31.807]  We don't have many of those left, but we still have small quantity of brain force available at that discount.
[00:57:31.847 --> 00:57:33.048]  So don't delay.
[00:57:33.628 --> 00:57:35.189]  Support this network.
[00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:37.171]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:41.374]  I just want to flash back to that man draped in the ISIS flag there.
[00:57:42.355 --> 00:57:43.396]  Again, I tweeted this out.
[00:57:43.957 --> 00:57:46.980]  He's walking nonchalantly down a Paris street.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:47.801]  I think he's in Paris.
[00:57:47.821 --> 00:57:48.761]  It's at least in France.
[00:57:48.802 --> 00:57:50.884]  You can see the French street signs.
[00:57:51.564 --> 00:57:53.226]  Draped in an ISIS flag!
[00:57:53.706 --> 00:57:54.687]  Nobody cares!
[00:57:55.388 --> 00:57:56.689]  Nobody's even looking at him!
[00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:59.292]  The thing is, the same thing happened in London.
[00:57:59.692 --> 00:58:00.673]  We had the article.
[00:58:00.693 --> 00:58:01.794]  This is out of Daily Mail.
[00:58:03.138 --> 00:58:08.005]  Father brazenly parading ISIS flags with his toddler outside Parliament is stopped by police.
[00:58:08.045 --> 00:58:09.567]  There you see the guy in France.
[00:58:10.188 --> 00:58:13.593]  But is allowed to walk free after officers say he's not breaking the law.
[00:58:14.013 --> 00:58:15.555]  So this happened in London.
[00:58:15.876 --> 00:58:17.158]  It happened in France.
[00:58:17.778 --> 00:58:19.200]  They do nothing whatsoever.
[00:58:19.801 --> 00:58:21.822]  They briefly ask a couple of questions.
[00:58:21.862 --> 00:58:32.970]  They're literally draped in the flag of a global terrorist group that's killed thousands of people, that is carrying out attacks on the streets of Europe on an almost bi-weekly basis at this point.
[00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:34.811]  Nothing whatsoever happens.
[00:58:35.391 --> 00:58:38.033]  This is what capitulation looks like.
[00:58:38.073 --> 00:58:40.274]  We'll be back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:40.294 --> 00:58:42.055]  Don't go away.
[00:58:43.316 --> 00:58:44.617]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.677 --> 00:58:47.639]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:53.955 --> 00:59:03.825]  UC Berkeley, which has been the battleground for free speech, has cancelled conservative commentator Ann Coulter's speaking event, citing safety concerns.
[00:59:04.025 --> 00:59:16.577]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short notice for a later date on May 2nd, which would be during Dead Week, when students are not even in class as they prep for finals.
[00:59:16.857 --> 00:59:28.510]  So essentially, Berkeley is appeasing the temper tantrum-throwing Antifa by canceling conservative speaker events that were properly invited by recognized student groups.
[00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:32.815]  Culture has stated that she plans to speak at Berkeley despite the cancellation.
[00:59:33.055 --> 00:59:40.638]  ...and has criticized Berkeley's chief of police for allowing Rodney King-style riots to go on when only conservative speakers speak.
[00:59:40.778 --> 00:59:50.042]  Berkeley was known as the birthplace of the student-led free speech movement in the 1960s, and now it's becoming the birthplace of student-led censorship.
[00:59:50.182 --> 00:59:53.123]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:59:54.904 --> 01:00:00.786]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:16.458]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:16.918 --> 01:00:21.963]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:28.539 --> 01:00:28.939]  We are live.
[01:00:29.019 --> 01:00:31.340]  It is the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:37.441]  Now a lot of you have probably been following the on-again, off-again situation with Ann Coulter's speech at Berkeley.
[01:00:38.281 --> 01:00:41.562]  Of course, several months ago we had Milo try to give a speech there.
[01:00:41.742 --> 01:00:44.103]  It ended in absolute bedlam and chaos.
[01:00:44.743 --> 01:00:53.765]  Berkeley has made it clear repeatedly that they don't stand behind the First Amendment unless you're spouting far-left, regressive, social justice warrior rhetoric.
[01:00:54.525 --> 01:01:04.535]  Then you can do whatever you want, but God forbid you would commit the thought crime of having a different opinion, because we don't want to actually celebrate and embrace diversity of opinion and thought in universities, do we?
[01:01:04.956 --> 01:01:05.696]  God forbid!
[01:01:05.716 --> 01:01:11.602]  Ann Coulter calls Berkeley's bluff administrators' reverse decision to cancel speech.
[01:01:11.662 --> 01:01:13.004]  The pressure has worked.
[01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:15.385]  But they're still trying to reschedule it.
[01:01:15.525 --> 01:01:20.528]  Ann Coulter wants to do it on the originally scheduled date of April 27th.
[01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:31.734]  If the Berkeley police actually did their job, which they didn't in this case, which they didn't during the Battle of Berkeley last weekend, then the situation would be a whole lot easier, wouldn't it?
[01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:37.058]  Let's go to Ann Coulter on Sean Hannity now, talking about Berkeley's reversal.
[01:01:37.098 --> 01:01:37.638]  Here's the clip.
[01:01:38.311 --> 01:01:42.655]  I think that Berkeley just want, for one thing, they are so completely insulated.
[01:01:43.895 --> 01:01:58.507]  Obviously they were stung by all these lefties around the country saying, well no, even though you're a university campus and you seem to have abandoned all constitutional rights or concept of free speech, you have to let, you have to let people speak.
[01:01:58.907 --> 01:02:01.950]  You can't discriminate them against them on the basis of viewpoint.
[01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:08.854]  No, you cannot impose arbitrary and harassing restrictions on the exercise of a constitutional right.
[01:02:09.254 --> 01:02:11.776]  I don't happen to be available on May 2nd.
[01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:15.618]  Moreover, there are a lot of great reporters in San Francisco.
[01:02:15.678 --> 01:02:18.420]  I think they might want to ask Janet Napolitano this.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:30.547]  Is she willing to have, even if this were possible, to pay the hundreds of thousands of dollars in rescheduled, rebooked hotel rooms, flights for me, my security, my guests?
[01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:35.270]  Um, was Vincente Fox required to reschedule randomly?
[01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:38.852]  Um, when they canceled originally, they said they'd reschedule for September.
[01:02:38.912 --> 01:02:42.095]  Now, they just pick another date out of the, out of the hat.
[01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:44.256]  None of this has to do with security.
[01:02:44.276 --> 01:02:50.741]  Um, after acceding to all of their requirements, which were also arbitrary and silly.
[01:02:51.161 --> 01:02:53.003]  And they claimed it was on the basis of safety.
[01:02:53.444 --> 01:02:59.491]  I suggested two measures that actually would allow free speech to exist on Berkeley, if they wanted it to.
[01:03:00.452 --> 01:03:08.622]  And that was one thing, to announce that any students caught engaging in violence, mayhem, or disrupting, and invited speakers.
[01:03:08.882 --> 01:03:10.883]  Number one, speech would be expelled.
[01:03:11.263 --> 01:03:21.168]  And number two, to have a little talk with the Berkeley Chief of Police, who is allowing these Rodney King riots to go on whenever a conservative speaker speaks.
[01:03:21.609 --> 01:03:30.153]  This is a form of anarchy when you are only enforcing the law in order to allow liberals to speak.
[01:03:30.353 --> 01:03:46.174]  But no, we'll let these masked rioters show up with weapons and start, I mean they are all little beta males, but with a weapon even a beta male can do some damage, especially to a 99 pound girl, to have them stepping in.
[01:03:46.574 --> 01:03:55.937]  Those private individuals, according to courts, are acting under color of state law and for the police to refuse to protect even offensive speech.
[01:03:56.097 --> 01:03:59.078]  And by the way, I'm the author of 12 New York Times bestsellers.
[01:03:59.578 --> 01:04:03.080]  This is damaged my reputation for them to be acting like I'm David Duke out there.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:10.982]  But courts have found even somebody out burning an American flag, the police cannot stand by and let skinheads beat them up.
[01:04:11.082 --> 01:04:12.703]  That is viewpoint discrimination.
[01:04:14.755 --> 01:04:15.996]  That double standard, isn't it?
[01:04:16.036 --> 01:04:21.120]  If the police just did their job and treated everyone equally, we wouldn't have a problem here.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.783]  Look at what happened in Auburn with Richard Spencer's speech a few days ago.
[01:04:25.123 --> 01:04:27.085]  The cops did their job.
[01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:28.946]  They broke up the fight.
[01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:33.610]  They forced Antifa to de-mask before they even got to the area.
[01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:37.691]  If the cops in Berkeley simply did their job, this wouldn't be an issue.
[01:04:37.911 --> 01:04:44.013]  Don't allow the chicken-necked Antifa thugs to burn things down and violently attack people.
[01:04:44.253 --> 01:04:48.494]  Then everybody can have their free speech and this is not even going to be an argument.
[01:04:49.334 --> 01:04:54.935]  Just do your damn job and be police officers and allow the First Amendment to be expressed.
[01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:57.396]  We will be back live on the Alex Jones Show with more.
[01:04:57.816 --> 01:04:59.817]  BreakingNewsInfoWars.com.
[01:04:59.857 --> 01:05:00.337]  Don't go away.
[01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:05.692]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[01:05:06.072 --> 01:05:18.083]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[01:05:18.103 --> 01:05:23.267]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:24.428]  You can look them up for yourself.
[01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:34.817]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[01:05:34.957 --> 01:05:41.122]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[01:05:41.983 --> 01:05:43.844]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[01:05:44.845 --> 01:05:46.066]  People are falling apart.
[01:05:46.106 --> 01:05:47.107]  They're totally depressed.
[01:05:47.127 --> 01:05:47.667]  They're unhappy.
[01:05:48.248 --> 01:05:49.229]  What is going on?
[01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:54.393]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:58.141]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[01:05:58.541 --> 01:06:00.242]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:06:00.442 --> 01:06:07.445]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:06:07.685 --> 01:06:16.008]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:23.911]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[01:06:24.292 --> 01:06:27.714]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:06:27.754 --> 01:06:30.877]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[01:06:31.477 --> 01:06:36.562]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:06:37.102 --> 01:06:40.244]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:06:40.544 --> 01:06:50.970]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:52.531]  The bone is so amazing.
[01:06:52.951 --> 01:06:58.534]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[01:06:59.653 --> 01:07:02.595]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[01:07:03.135 --> 01:07:08.558]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[01:07:08.838 --> 01:07:18.322]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:23.165]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[01:07:23.385 --> 01:07:25.166]  This is a absolute win-win.
[01:07:25.226 --> 01:07:28.007]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.

[01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:48.996]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[01:07:49.516 --> 01:07:52.117]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[01:07:52.824 --> 01:07:56.127]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[01:07:56.507 --> 01:07:59.930]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[01:08:14.176 --> 01:08:18.642]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.863]  We're live into the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:29.883 --> 01:08:35.507]  We're talking about Ann Coulter and her speech at Berkeley, which was originally scheduled again for April 27th.
[01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:37.429]  They tried to cancel it.
[01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:38.950]  Huge amount of pressure.
[01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.871]  They had to back off.
[01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:42.033]  Now they're trying to rearrange it for a different date.
[01:08:42.514 --> 01:08:44.715]  Ann Coulter is refusing to back down.
[01:08:45.356 --> 01:08:53.086]  We also have Howard Dean, the former presidential candidate, coming out and saying, hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment.
[01:08:53.126 --> 01:08:53.927]  That's the headline.
[01:08:54.368 --> 01:09:01.918]  Howard Dean, in a tweet, the former Vermont Governor and DNC Chair, said, quote, hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment.
[01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:03.159]  That was his tweet.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:05.161]  Newsflash for Howard Dean.
[01:09:05.221 --> 01:09:07.142]  There's no exception in the First Amendment.
[01:09:07.983 --> 01:09:08.783]  Everything goes.
[01:09:08.943 --> 01:09:14.467]  Also, the Supreme Court has ruled over and over again that hate speech is part of free speech.
[01:09:14.527 --> 01:09:19.791]  Of course, we know that, according to a leftist, hate speech is disagreeing with their opinion.
[01:09:20.251 --> 01:09:23.433]  So that's why it's important to remain part of the First Amendment.
[01:09:23.453 --> 01:09:25.915]  But according to Howard Dean, he doesn't know the Constitution.
[01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:28.416]  He doesn't know the history of Supreme Court rulings.
[01:09:28.897 --> 01:09:31.278]  He says hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment.
[01:09:31.318 --> 01:09:33.240]  He got absolutely rinsed.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:36.062]  Over that tweet, and rightly so.
[01:09:36.582 --> 01:09:38.704]  Leanne McAdoo, we're talking about Ann Coulter.
[01:09:38.864 --> 01:09:44.129]  I mean, as I was saying before the break, if the cops in Berkeley just did their job, this wouldn't be a problem, right?
[01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:51.471]  Exactly, that's what we saw in Auburn, where they at least made Antifa take off their masks, saying, listen, we'll let you in the event.
[01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:55.894]  You can even take your little rioting sticks in there with you, but you're going to be unmasked.
[01:09:56.014 --> 01:10:03.619]  You're going to be open and available to get surveilled and we'll have you on video, so if you want to pull any stunts or
[01:10:04.219 --> 01:10:08.644]  You know, we've got the Antifa group selling concealed knives on their website.
[01:10:08.944 --> 01:10:14.831]  So if you want to go stab people, beat them with bike locks, we're going to be able to track you down and find out who you are.
[01:10:14.871 --> 01:10:16.173]  There's going to be some consequences.
[01:10:17.093 --> 01:10:21.756]  There was actually an article up today out of American Mirror, and they put up an interesting video.
[01:10:21.776 --> 01:10:29.181]  The headline is, And it's an interesting video.
[01:10:29.241 --> 01:10:46.853]  They claim in this video that some of the so-called flashbangs or fireworks that were, you know, fired towards Trump supporters during that clash were actually fired by the police standing on a nearby building, that they actually wanted to create this clash between Antifa and Trump supporters again.
[01:10:47.393 --> 01:10:51.015]  Total opposition to what happened at Auburn, which was the police actually doing their jobs.
[01:10:51.055 --> 01:10:55.936]  It seems, if this video is true, the police could have actually been inciting that.
[01:10:55.996 --> 01:10:59.258]  Now, that's not proven, but that's the claim being made by that video.
[01:10:59.318 --> 01:11:05.300]  Well, of course, that would bolster support for the police to move in and get a little bit more heavy-handed with these protesters.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:15.444]  Give them... because that... Initially, when Milo Yiannopoulos was there, the mayor was in full support of these protesters, and then he had to walk that back once he saw how violent
[01:11:16.144 --> 01:11:16.304]  I don't
[01:11:33.437 --> 01:11:39.640]  And so of course they're planning this same type of violence with this Ann Coulter speech so I can understand the school.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:44.061]  You know, it's finals week, people are getting ready for finals, we're concerned.
[01:11:44.462 --> 01:11:51.664]  I'm surprised these progressive leftist professors don't just cancel finals altogether and give them credit for showing up to these riots.
[01:11:51.684 --> 01:11:57.347]  Well they've actually unmasked some of the individuals involved in these riots at Berkeley and some of them are professors.
[01:11:59.569 --> 01:11:59.989]  Yeah!
[01:12:00.009 --> 01:12:03.831]  They're directly involved in the fighting, the beatings.
[01:12:04.311 --> 01:12:06.111]  But yeah, I mean, it's an interesting video.
[01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:12.354]  The other aspect of it is, of course, what happened at Auburn when the police did their jobs and made Antifa unmask.
[01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:14.554]  And we played that video earlier on in the week.
[01:12:15.235 --> 01:12:22.437]  They weren't so keen to get involved in squabbles when their faces were visible because their whole shtick is committing crimes.
[01:12:22.757 --> 01:12:23.257]  Exactly.
[01:12:23.337 --> 01:12:25.018]  That's what they are showing up to do.
[01:12:25.118 --> 01:12:28.998]  Like I said, they're selling concealed knives on their website.
[01:12:29.018 --> 01:12:31.899]  So these are knives that look like little credit cards.
[01:12:32.239 --> 01:12:35.960]  So they can take these in and they're for slicing conservatives.
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:38.241]  This is anarchic.
[01:12:38.301 --> 01:12:40.601]  It's a very violence-driven message.
[01:12:41.361 --> 01:12:42.321]  And they're protesting against
[01:12:44.702 --> 01:12:46.703]  People that they haven't even read their work.
[01:12:47.143 --> 01:12:52.504]  I mean, when we had Heather McDonald, her speech was heavily fought against there.
[01:12:52.564 --> 01:12:54.345]  They stopped it, shut it down.
[01:12:55.105 --> 01:13:03.067]  It was about law enforcement and how dangerous it is for people to be actually targeting now the law enforcement.
[01:13:03.188 --> 01:13:06.869]  And the Black Lives Matter shut that down because it was racist.
[01:13:07.269 --> 01:13:09.349]  She's racist for saying don't kill cops.
[01:13:09.429 --> 01:13:10.350]  You can't say that now.
[01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:11.270]  That's a racist thing.
[01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:16.235]  So they haven't even read a lot of the works that they're out there protesting and trying to shut down.
[01:13:16.295 --> 01:13:27.368]  But what I just think is so incredible is that for some reason they think that this type of violence, this type of censorship isn't going to
[01:13:28.109 --> 01:13:28.289]  Come on!
[01:13:48.832 --> 01:13:56.456]  Propagated to and programmed here in the universities, but the generation right behind them is trending more conservative, even more conservative than their parents.
[01:13:56.957 --> 01:14:07.602]  So imagine in a few years time, are those Generation Z, I believe they're called, are they going to be shutting down the progressive speakers from coming into the university?
[01:14:07.702 --> 01:14:09.463]  I mean, it's going to completely flip on its head.
[01:14:09.503 --> 01:14:17.388]  So it's interesting that they don't think that this is going, that they're always going to be in power and that they're not going to be on the receiving end of this censorship.
[01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:18.911]  Well, I mean, that's the point, isn't it?
[01:14:19.271 --> 01:14:22.734]  Progressives or regressives, as they're accurately called, all the new Puritans.
[01:14:22.774 --> 01:14:28.199]  It used to be religious conservatives that censored people back in the 60s, 70s and 80s.
[01:14:28.559 --> 01:14:29.720]  Now it's flipped over.
[01:14:30.141 --> 01:14:33.223]  But again, we're seeing the same process whereby this is defended.
[01:14:33.284 --> 01:14:34.264]  It doesn't matter what your opinion.
[01:14:34.324 --> 01:14:38.468]  Even Richard Spencer, who we disagree with, he has his First Amendment right.
[01:14:38.728 --> 01:14:40.190]  Just let him express it.
[01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:42.672]  Of course, they say that words of violence
[01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:46.153]  Any disagreement with them is actual violence.
[01:14:46.193 --> 01:14:50.295]  They've re-characterized it as that in their, you know, Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:14:50.575 --> 01:14:54.636]  But we also had the media focus after the second battle of Berkeley.
[01:14:54.976 --> 01:14:57.897]  It wasn't about the Antifa thugs throwing fireworks.
[01:14:57.957 --> 01:14:59.498]  It wasn't about them throwing stones.
[01:15:00.038 --> 01:15:03.219]  It was about this girl with the dreadlocks being punched.
[01:15:03.339 --> 01:15:03.919]  Moldy locks.
[01:15:03.959 --> 01:15:04.720]  Moldy locks.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.461]  Now, we don't advocate punching women in the face.
[01:15:07.801 --> 01:15:11.442]  But if you are going around smashing bottles on people's heads, which some of these
[01:15:11.442 --> 01:15:13.523]  The intent to take some Nazi scalps.
[01:15:13.583 --> 01:15:16.143]  Yeah, which she posted on her own Facebook page.
[01:15:16.523 --> 01:15:19.264]  Then, I personally have got no sympathy for her.
[01:15:19.384 --> 01:15:19.584]  Yeah.
[01:15:19.644 --> 01:15:20.605]  I wouldn't do it myself.
[01:15:20.685 --> 01:15:21.685]  I wouldn't attack her myself.
[01:15:21.725 --> 01:15:22.545]  I wouldn't attack a woman.
[01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:28.447]  But if that happens, she's going into that wanting to be violent, wanting to have a violent confrontation.
[01:15:28.847 --> 01:15:35.329]  You can't really have any sympathy for her or Antifa as a whole when that's their entire shtick is to cause violence.
[01:15:35.389 --> 01:15:36.789]  But what was the media reaction?
[01:15:36.809 --> 01:15:39.250]  It's sort of sexist of you to say that you wouldn't hit a woman.
[01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:40.747]  Well, God forbid.
[01:15:41.027 --> 01:15:47.169]  But then the media, that was all was in the media, was this poor girl being punched in the face.
[01:15:47.329 --> 01:15:51.349]  Yeah, you don't see her hitting, throwing bottles and rocks at people beforehand.
[01:15:51.889 --> 01:15:55.790]  And I don't, you know, the guy that hit her, I don't think that that's right at all.
[01:15:56.150 --> 01:16:05.412]  I mean, obviously, I think that's, but it's just so interesting to see the hypocrisy because they were really pushing, the media was like debating, is it okay to punch a Nazi?
[01:16:05.492 --> 01:16:08.013]  Yeah, I think it's okay, you know, and then if it's flipped around.
[01:16:09.213 --> 01:16:11.634]  Violent Antifa people, you can't punch them.
[01:16:11.674 --> 01:16:18.057]  You had the guy, the maker of, what was it, Stranger Things, the Netflix show, get up on stage and say, punch a Nazi in the face.
[01:16:18.097 --> 01:16:19.158]  They all celebrated it.
[01:16:20.218 --> 01:16:22.739]  If you want to live by that rule, then you die by that rule.
[01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:30.503]  So I've got absolutely no sympathy if your people are getting punched in the face because you made that bed, now you've got a lie in it.
[01:16:30.663 --> 01:16:30.883]  Right.
[01:16:31.043 --> 01:16:33.324]  It's just equality for all.
[01:16:33.344 --> 01:16:35.045]  We're all equal in our oppression now.
[01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:36.646]  But again,
[01:16:37.786 --> 01:16:40.769]  How the censorship is going to turn around could come back to bite them.
[01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:51.237]  We have the media kind of really celebrating that Facebook and Google, these other tech giants, are going to be using these truthiness filters, as former President Obama called for.
[01:16:51.818 --> 01:16:54.019]  But it's now coming back to bite them.
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.221]  It's actually affecting their traffic.
[01:16:57.162 --> 01:16:59.464]  Facebook's fake news filter is killing traffic.
[01:16:59.624 --> 01:17:03.247]  More news sites are saying, we are at the mercy of the algorithms.
[01:17:03.687 --> 01:17:09.752]  And so they are now, this is the Chicago Tribune, is one of the most affected by this fake news filter.
[01:17:10.412 --> 01:17:10.973]  But that's it.
[01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:15.416]  It's just like determining what is hate speech or what's offensive today.
[01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:21.481]  People are going to be able to kind of game these algorithms and everyone's going to be affected.
[01:17:21.521 --> 01:17:30.087]  That's why it's so important to fight for the First Amendment and to understand that even though you might disagree with what someone is saying, we have to protect
[01:17:30.928 --> 01:17:33.410]  Free speech and the free access to information.
[01:17:34.111 --> 01:17:40.156]  And the headline is, where at the mercy of the algos, more news sites say Facebook's fake news filter is killing traffic.
[01:17:40.196 --> 01:17:42.317]  If you want to flash that up, it's a Zero Hedge article.
[01:17:42.778 --> 01:17:54.808]  They talk about the Chicago Tribune's deputy editor complaining about the fact that their Facebook reach has been dramatically suppressed over the past few weeks since this new filter came into effect.
[01:17:55.268 --> 01:17:57.629]  Now it turns out the Chicago Tribune was not alone.
[01:17:58.009 --> 01:18:02.090]  The Boston Globe is also talking about how engagement has plummeted.
[01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:04.771]  I've seen this on our own Facebook pages.
[01:18:05.191 --> 01:18:10.333]  So it seems that the very outlets that called for this censorship, it's now blowing back in their face, right?
[01:18:10.593 --> 01:18:36.253]  Yeah, the legitimate news sources are, they say they're worse off than where they were to start with, before they were calling for all, yes, shut down the fake news, and they all changed their headline, we're the real news, democracy dies in the dark, and now their online traffic is being affected, because you can't just censor one group of people and not think that that censorship is going to be turned against you, even by AI, even by an algorithm.
[01:18:36.493 --> 01:18:38.375]  They might just decide that you're offensive.
[01:18:38.868 --> 01:18:46.170]  Well, I mean, they came out with a fake news list, one of them which the Washington Post heavily featured, the prop or not list, which they had to back away from.
[01:18:46.576 --> 01:18:49.438]  It was just basically every conservative website.
[01:18:49.698 --> 01:19:03.746]  There's a distinction between fake news blogs that deliberately put out insane headlines like, you know, Hillary Clinton kills FBI agent was one of them, to make money from advertising clicks, and conservative websites that have a different opinion.
[01:19:03.867 --> 01:19:04.067]  Yeah.
[01:19:04.167 --> 01:19:06.068]  But no, they didn't make that distinction.
[01:19:06.348 --> 01:19:07.709]  They lumped everybody in.
[01:19:07.749 --> 01:19:09.330]  They tarred us all with the same brush.
[01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:10.930]  And now, look, what's happened?
[01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:12.191]  Well, well done, idiots.
[01:19:12.551 --> 01:19:17.392]  Now you're getting censored as well, and they thoroughly deserve it for pushing that in the first place, right?
[01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:17.752]  Right.
[01:19:18.052 --> 01:19:25.093]  Well, which is why, you know, I'm really glad to see Ann Coulter is saying, look, I've got a contract and, you know, you don't want to breach that contract with me.
[01:19:25.113 --> 01:19:25.713]  I'm going to fight it.
[01:19:25.733 --> 01:19:35.255]  I'm going to show up and allow the police to do their job at this point and let people who aren't students there keep them from campus.
[01:19:35.295 --> 01:19:36.035]  Are you going to be going?
[01:19:36.055 --> 01:19:38.296]  I know Ann Coulter is actually a big fan of yours, Paul.
[01:19:39.204 --> 01:19:48.667]  I've messaged her actually, so we'll see, but we'll definitely be sending a camera crew down there for potentially the Battle of Berkeley Part 3, but we will be back on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:19:49.107 --> 01:19:51.608]  More news about social media, more news about YouTube.
[01:19:52.028 --> 01:19:53.688]  We will be back with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.769]  Don't go away.
[01:19:54.809 --> 01:19:56.909]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:56.929 --> 01:19:57.470]  We'll be back.
[01:20:02.691 --> 01:20:02.991]  Hunter.
[01:20:03.851 --> 01:20:05.512]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:12.973]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:20:13.673 --> 01:20:17.655]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:20:18.535 --> 01:20:20.756]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:20:20.836 --> 01:20:21.997]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:26.559]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat, or more.
[01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:28.520]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:34.002]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22, when I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:20:34.102 --> 01:20:35.863]  It's actually scary.
[01:20:36.756 --> 01:20:46.863]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:20:47.824 --> 01:21:00.633]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[01:21:05.518 --> 01:21:07.319]  This is Thomas Friedman, New York Times.
[01:21:07.379 --> 01:21:09.720]  He writes that Trump should not fight ISIS.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:17.542]  Quote, the same way we encouraged the Mujahideen fighters to bleed Russia in Afghanistan.
[01:21:17.922 --> 01:21:24.925]  So you have a major New York Times writer openly calling for Trump to leave ISIS alone.
[01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:30.747]  I mean, Lionel, why is the establishment, which after all, you know, embraced this attack on Assad last week,
[01:21:31.287 --> 01:21:32.008]  They loved it!
[01:21:32.409 --> 01:21:39.135]  They immediately forgave Trump for many of his sins in the immediate aftermath of this Tomahawk missile attack.
[01:21:39.656 --> 01:21:46.643]  Why are they now openly encouraging him to allow the spread of a jihadist army that has terrorized an entire continent?
[01:21:47.484 --> 01:21:52.089]  Well, let me see if I can give you an adult and a cogent answer, because they're stupid!
[01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:56.018]  Americans are, no, no, stupid!
[01:21:56.718 --> 01:21:59.840]  Don't read, don't care, don't wonder.
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.320]  They're incurious.
[01:22:01.841 --> 01:22:03.562]  They know more about sports.
[01:22:03.622 --> 01:22:10.246]  They knew more about Tom Brady's under-inflated footballs than they do what's going on.
[01:22:10.506 --> 01:22:19.351]  In this article, he basically admits and explains that ISIS is a tool, a tool.
[01:22:19.431 --> 01:22:20.892]  He writes in there,
[01:22:21.953 --> 01:22:23.539]  That basically is an inside job.
[01:22:23.599 --> 01:22:25.305]  It's basically like professional wrestling.
[01:22:26.451 --> 01:22:27.512]  And nobody says anything.
[01:22:28.452 --> 01:22:29.553]  This was a test.
[01:22:29.933 --> 01:22:33.636]  This was to say, my God, do they read us?
[01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:35.137]  Do they care about us?
[01:22:35.457 --> 01:22:36.918]  Is anybody paying attention to us?
[01:22:37.098 --> 01:22:38.659]  Or do they just not know?
[01:22:39.059 --> 01:22:42.242]  I mean, Paul, I'm still reeling from that.
[01:22:42.762 --> 01:22:49.166]  I can't believe he was allowed to say that, frame that.
[01:22:50.087 --> 01:22:53.709]  That is the blueprint of what's going on.
[01:22:53.989 --> 01:22:55.470]  This is amazing.
[01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.991]  And also,
[01:22:57.011 --> 01:22:59.072]  I was doing a radio show this morning, to give you an example.
[01:22:59.413 --> 01:23:01.554]  And I'm sure you've done this too, because people think I'm nuts!
[01:23:02.234 --> 01:23:12.479]  Could be for different reasons, but I say, well, you do realize that there are a lot of people, myself included, who believe that the whole gas act was basically a false flag.
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:16.742]  That it was contrived, it was staged, it was orchestrated, as it was in 2013.
[01:23:17.442 --> 01:23:20.844]  CYHR said this, we have evidence of this, we know it, it's part of their MO.
[01:23:21.690 --> 01:23:22.790]  And you could hear the crickets!
[01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:24.551]  It was like somebody said, cue the crickets!
[01:23:24.591 --> 01:23:26.411]  And I said, did you hear what I said?
[01:23:26.771 --> 01:23:28.012]  Where the hell have you been?
[01:23:28.032 --> 01:23:30.372]  Paul, am I living in a parallel universe?
[01:23:30.573 --> 01:23:37.214]  Have you and Alex and others deluded me into thinking that somehow everybody knows what we know?
[01:23:37.595 --> 01:23:42.096]  Am I walking around in some kind of a cosmic psychotic fugue where
[01:23:42.956 --> 01:23:44.077]  Am I the only one?
[01:23:44.097 --> 01:23:45.999]  I'm not talking to a guy in the corner.
[01:23:46.299 --> 01:23:53.987]  I'm talking to a newspaper, a radio host who says, well, did you see the pictures of the dead babies?
[01:23:54.027 --> 01:23:55.348]  And the guy says, yes!
[01:23:57.230 --> 01:23:58.892]  That's the thing, Lionel, over and over again.
[01:23:59.232 --> 01:24:02.015]  It's this appeal to sentimentality and emotion.
[01:24:22.299 --> 01:24:23.860]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:28.604]  Coming up in the next segment we've got a very interesting piece from Alex Jones himself.
[01:24:29.045 --> 01:24:32.127]  The truth about what's happening with Bill O'Reilly and Fox News.
[01:24:32.187 --> 01:24:36.951]  Of course we have the brothers now exerting their influence over Fox News Network.
[01:24:37.551 --> 01:24:41.074]  What that means going forward and in fact I'm going to get into that a little bit later as well.
[01:24:41.094 --> 01:24:42.756]  But Leanne, we've got a few minutes left here.
[01:24:43.076 --> 01:24:46.619]  You want to talk about PBS putting out Islamist propaganda?
[01:24:47.139 --> 01:24:58.029]  Yes, I know David touched a little bit on this the other day, but this is a PBS Kids series, Dying to be a Martyr, and it explores the struggle of being a terrorist.
[01:24:58.129 --> 01:25:09.159]  And so they said if this is appropriate for students grades 9 through 12, there are three videos in this lesson plan about the struggle of Palestinian terrorists.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:28.127]  And basically trying to help them sympathize with the struggle of being a Palestinian terrorist, which they call them liberators, and kind of letting them understand why someone would be a suicide bomber, why they would decide to be a martyr.
[01:25:28.795 --> 01:25:29.996]  You're just legitimizing it, right?
[01:25:30.436 --> 01:25:38.281]  Yeah, I mean, it's just, to me, it's just incredible to see how Christianity, for instance, has been so demonized in this country.
[01:25:38.841 --> 01:25:46.565]  And it just, to the point where people who are Christian are afraid to even speak out because they'll be so fought against.
[01:25:46.946 --> 01:25:55.691]  But then you will have Islam, which is like, you know, if you're gay, for instance, it's a sin, punishable by death.
[01:25:56.491 --> 01:26:06.078]  And that, for whatever reason, is now being held up and exemplified and protected, especially by feminists who are like putting on hijabs and stuff in solidarity.
[01:26:06.118 --> 01:26:07.119]  It's just so weird.
[01:26:07.139 --> 01:26:18.387]  Linda Sarsour is a big icon now, the Sharia law FGM advocate, who literally said that Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who was a victim of female genital mutilation, should have her vagina removed.
[01:26:18.427 --> 01:26:20.649]  She's the big feminist icon right now.
[01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:27.171]  But with the PBS thing again, you know, there's an argument to be made, you drop a drone bomb on someone's house, it's going to radicalise them.
[01:26:27.191 --> 01:26:29.872]  Yes, that's one issue, don't get involved in foreign entanglements.
[01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:38.195]  But the argument that terrorism as a whole is a result of Western intervention, that argument can't be made when you account for the fact that
[01:26:38.795 --> 01:26:47.928]  Terrorism primarily targets Muslims killing other Muslims in Islamic countries, many of which have had no involvement, you know, with Western foreign intervention.
[01:26:47.968 --> 01:26:51.412]  So that completely destroys that argument on the face of it, right?
[01:26:51.553 --> 01:26:55.418]  Right, well this is also why you see so many people after a terrorist attack
[01:26:55.638 --> 01:27:13.471]  They're immediately defending the people who are the suicide bombers and they're basically, they rush to go and sympathize with the people who would mow down innocent people in Nice, for instance, and 80 plus people, including children, killed in this attack.
[01:27:13.531 --> 01:27:17.754]  And so they instantly, instead of saying, wow, this is terrible, they say, well, I get it.
[01:27:17.854 --> 01:27:20.095]  I mean, you see what's happening in their countries.
[01:27:20.115 --> 01:27:20.256]  Yeah.
[01:27:20.996 --> 01:27:22.618]  You saw it after the Fresno thing.
[01:27:22.638 --> 01:27:26.802]  They were more concerned about, again, the narrative on Twitter and denying it.
[01:27:26.822 --> 01:27:28.544]  It's like we saw with the French attack yesterday.
[01:27:28.984 --> 01:27:32.568]  Don't say it's a terror attack, don't say it's a terror attack until we know all the details.
[01:27:32.888 --> 01:27:37.914]  And by the time they've known all the details, in like two weeks' time, everybody's forgotten about it, right?
[01:27:37.934 --> 01:27:38.614]  Right, exactly.
[01:27:39.315 --> 01:27:40.636]  No, no, get in front of the facts.
[01:27:40.836 --> 01:27:41.296]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:41.416 --> 01:27:47.498]  And then Trump comes out after the French president had come out and said it was terrorism and says it's likely terrorism.
[01:27:47.538 --> 01:27:49.238]  Says it looks like, doesn't even say.
[01:27:49.318 --> 01:27:50.639]  Still searching for a motive.
[01:27:50.839 --> 01:27:52.960]  Yeah, still searching for a motive.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:58.642]  And they will run that spiel for hours and then days afterwards until the next one happens.
[01:27:59.022 --> 01:28:01.403]  And then it's, oh, we don't know who it is, might be a white supremacist.
[01:28:01.583 --> 01:28:06.124]  Because if it is a white person, then it's immediately a terrorist attack, right?
[01:28:06.384 --> 01:28:07.805]  Within minutes on Twitter,
[01:28:08.705 --> 01:28:10.127]  White people have to answer for this.
[01:28:10.147 --> 01:28:12.209]  You've seen the Salon.com articles.
[01:28:12.589 --> 01:28:13.911]  You know, the Boston bombing.
[01:28:14.752 --> 01:28:16.013]  White people have to answer.
[01:28:16.053 --> 01:28:19.296]  But when the Boston bombing happened, they didn't run that same spiel, did they?
[01:28:19.637 --> 01:28:21.498]  No, he got a Rolling Stone cover.
[01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:23.969]  Exactly, he was a rock star.
[01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:27.490]  There's a YouTube fake news workshop.
[01:28:27.891 --> 01:28:31.232]  It's out of BBC News YouTube to offer fake news workshops to teenagers.
[01:28:31.752 --> 01:28:38.894]  So basically what they're doing, because we're completely decimating them on YouTube, we've got millions of views and subscribers, they've got a pathetic amount.
[01:28:39.654 --> 01:28:46.037]  They're selecting and promoting these SJW accounts, putting them in the trending section.
[01:28:46.317 --> 01:28:53.101]  You can go down the list, and I'll get more into detail about this later, but it's basically, you know, Black Lives Matter, Social Justice Warriors, Feminists.
[01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:55.642]  Nobody wants to watch that on YouTube.
[01:28:55.962 --> 01:28:58.183]  You've seen the upvotes to downvotes.
[01:28:58.563 --> 01:28:59.984]  It's an absolute wreck.
[01:29:00.044 --> 01:29:02.545]  It's a completely demolished channel.
[01:29:02.605 --> 01:29:03.806]  Some of these people are quitting.
[01:29:04.466 --> 01:29:07.230]  All together, because they don't resonate, we do.
[01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:10.634]  So YouTube is now trying to game its own system and push these people.
[01:29:10.754 --> 01:29:12.176]  Well, and talk about fake news.
[01:29:12.236 --> 01:29:15.180]  I mean, there's just so much fake information out there.
[01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:20.667]  I just saw something, I think it was on Instagram about how, or no, it was on Twitter, about how
[01:29:22.069 --> 01:29:30.074]  The white English language was created by black people through a series of, you know, historical... And it's just like, what are you talking about?
[01:29:30.094 --> 01:29:31.215]  No, it was not.
[01:29:31.275 --> 01:29:32.976]  It's like a Germanic language.
[01:29:33.156 --> 01:29:40.300]  There's a lot of fake news out there, so it'll be interesting to see how the Social Justice Warrior YouTube fares.
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:43.682]  They're gonna try and push it because they're failing miserably otherwise.
[01:29:43.702 --> 01:29:48.365]  Alex Jones is coming up with a special report on Bill O'Reilly and Fox News.
[01:29:48.445 --> 01:29:49.165]  Don't miss it.
[01:29:49.245 --> 01:29:50.366]  We'll be back live next.
[01:29:52.130 --> 01:29:55.137]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:58.746]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:03.278]  All right.
[01:30:03.918 --> 01:30:13.781]  UC Berkeley, which has been the battleground for free speech, has canceled conservative commentator Ann Coulter's speaking event, citing safety concerns.
[01:30:13.981 --> 01:30:26.526]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short notice for a later date on May 2nd, which would be during dead week, when students are not even in class as they prep for finals.
[01:30:26.806 --> 01:30:38.450]  So essentially, Berkeley is appeasing the temper tantrum-throwing Antifa by canceling conservative speaker events that were properly invited by recognized student groups.
[01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:50.573]  Coulter has stated that she plans to speak at Berkeley despite the cancellation, and has criticized Berkeley's chief of police for allowing Rodney King-style riots to go on when only conservative speakers speak.
[01:30:50.713 --> 01:30:52.514]  Berkeley was known as the birthplace
[01:30:52.674 --> 01:31:01.476]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[01:31:01.577 --> 01:31:05.658]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption.
[01:31:17.941 --> 01:31:21.543]  And a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[01:31:21.924 --> 01:31:25.806]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[01:31:25.886 --> 01:31:28.868]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[01:31:28.888 --> 01:31:36.573]  We now have George Soros as a goblin on the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters.
[01:31:36.933 --> 01:31:38.695]  No Soros, him as a goblin.
[01:31:39.435 --> 01:31:43.820]  It says Deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[01:31:46.063 --> 01:31:53.151]  So it is a limited edition Deport Soros on the back, Hillary for President on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[01:31:53.511 --> 01:31:54.032]  It's powerful.
[01:31:54.052 --> 01:31:55.153]  I hope you get out to everybody you know.
[01:31:55.413 --> 01:31:57.155]  InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:05.333 --> 01:32:06.053]  We're good to go.
[01:32:35.673 --> 01:32:38.474]  Our Christ raised from the dead on the third day.
[01:32:39.614 --> 01:32:46.415]  And our Republic can rise from the dead if we wake up to what the globalists are doing and if you support independent free media.
[01:32:46.835 --> 01:32:51.176]  There's never been a better time to support InfoWars with these specials at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:51.616 --> 01:32:52.936]  Because it's all about life.

[01:33:25.314 --> 01:33:37.380]  I haven't commented yet on Bill O'Reilly being let go from Fox after 15 years at the top of the cable news cycle with up to 5 million viewers a night.
[01:33:39.362 --> 01:33:43.244]  Bill O'Reilly is obviously a very complex character, a very intelligent man.
[01:33:43.264 --> 01:33:44.825]  I remember seeing him on
[01:33:46.357 --> 01:33:58.479]  Extra and shows like that back in the 1980s and early 1990s doing pieces on the JFK assassination and the government shipping narcotics into the United States.
[01:33:58.579 --> 01:34:03.020]  He was once pretty much a proto Alex Jones.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:10.601]  He was a forerunner of investigative modern journalism and the internet world kind of a Matt Drudge in some respects.
[01:34:11.221 --> 01:34:14.882]  He was also famous for saying F it do it live.
[01:34:16.138 --> 01:34:21.984]  That's tomorrow, and that is it for us today, and we will leave you with a... I can't do it.
[01:34:23.365 --> 01:34:24.066]  We'll do it live.
[01:34:26.248 --> 01:34:27.069]  We'll do it live!
[01:34:28.110 --> 01:34:31.453]  That said, Bill O'Reilly was also a tremendous bully.
[01:34:32.434 --> 01:34:35.197]  Famous, when he had a radio talk show that failed.
[01:34:36.374 --> 01:34:55.428]  For having his security team with caller ID, whether it was in Florida or New York, actually in some cases reportedly fly to go to another state to go to the door and knock on it and threaten callers that had disagreed with him or made a point he didn't like.
[01:34:55.588 --> 01:34:56.329]  That is just crazy.
[01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:58.751]  I remember him threatening callers on air.
[01:35:00.192 --> 01:35:01.893]  We should probably look online trying to find some of those.
[01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:04.575]  So the guy was a consummate bully.
[01:35:05.882 --> 01:35:15.818]  And he also would do stuff like play a clip of me yelling about some police corruption, turn my face red and say, coming up we explore sexual predators against women.
[01:35:16.525 --> 01:35:18.967]  They read kind of fast because they're too dumb.
[01:35:19.327 --> 01:35:25.512]  You know what it's like to go to sleep every night knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers and you bastards are probably going to end up killing me one day!
[01:35:25.592 --> 01:35:26.313]  Hate speech.
[01:35:26.713 --> 01:35:30.036]  Now Facebook is apologizing for allowing it worldwide.
[01:35:30.536 --> 01:35:32.678]  But can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[01:35:32.738 --> 01:35:36.480]  Which is directly linked into the IRS Tea Party scandal.
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.542]  We'll have a factor investigation.
[01:35:39.143 --> 01:35:40.864]  Well, no one's ever said that about me.
[01:35:41.785 --> 01:35:45.988]  So again, he was projecting onto yours truly, Alex Jones, what he himself
[01:35:47.924 --> 01:36:04.971]  Has settled cases on, not where he put out advances towards women and then they, you know, rebuffed it and he stopped, but where he pressured people under him over and over and over and over and over and over again to have sex with him.
[01:36:05.411 --> 01:36:10.713]  And of course they refused him and then he would reportedly demote them or have them transferred.
[01:36:12.015 --> 01:36:17.009]  And Roger Ailes basically encouraged all of this, and he's been let go for the same reason.
[01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:18.413]  Now, that said...
[01:36:19.571 --> 01:36:30.038]  Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly are doing the same garbage that Democrats in Hollywood are even more famous for, but they're getting child actors, girls and boys, to have sex with them.
[01:36:30.338 --> 01:36:33.060]  That's all come out over and over again, and that all gets covered up.
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:38.424]  So all I'm saying is, yeah, let's prosecute Edward Snowden for breaking the law, leaking secret documents.
[01:36:38.884 --> 01:36:44.188]  After you prosecute our own government and all these corporations for doing things 10,000 times literally worse.
[01:36:45.776 --> 01:36:48.738]  And then you'll never get around to Snowden because he was actually exposing criminal activity.
[01:36:49.578 --> 01:36:50.619]  So maybe he shouldn't be charged.
[01:36:50.659 --> 01:36:52.720]  The point is, letter of the law, spirit of the law.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:37:00.405]  You can't be violating the letter and the spirit, many, many times worse than somebody else, and then have the very same system sit in judgment.
[01:37:01.265 --> 01:37:07.269]  So this is a part of a purge at Fox by Rupert Murdoch's sons that are admittedly saying this in the news.
[01:37:08.246 --> 01:37:17.117]  I was the first to break it during the RNC because I went to the Ritz Carlton in Cleveland and met for several hours with some of the top Fox people and got the intel and it all bared out to be true.
[01:37:17.578 --> 01:37:18.779]  That there was a coup in Fox.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.525]  Megyn Kelly was meant to kind of be the flipping of them from conservative Americana.
[01:37:24.506 --> 01:37:36.910]  At least light, or what they pose to be, the synthetic version that they use to control the conservative movement, into a whole leftist, kind of globalist, conservatoid, synthetic system even more than what it had been.
[01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:39.291]  So a true counterfeit.
[01:37:40.631 --> 01:37:45.333]  To lead the conservative movement, the libertarian movement, the nationalist movement, into a true rat hole.
[01:37:46.383 --> 01:37:48.165]  But Fox threw everything it had at Trump.
[01:37:48.825 --> 01:37:50.026]  Megan threw everything she had at Trump.
[01:37:50.106 --> 01:37:50.547]  It failed.
[01:37:51.047 --> 01:37:52.369]  So she left NBC.
[01:37:53.029 --> 01:37:56.132]  Ailes still stepped down because clearly he'd done some things that were wrong and bad.
[01:37:56.152 --> 01:37:56.833]  I'm not defending him.
[01:37:57.633 --> 01:38:00.216]  People say, oh, you're being nice to Fox because you wanted a job from Roger Ailes.
[01:38:00.336 --> 01:38:02.538]  I was offered shows on Fox, okay?
[01:38:02.978 --> 01:38:03.939]  I'll get to that in a minute.
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:05.821]  But expanding on that,
[01:38:07.526 --> 01:38:12.989]  They can take them out, they can take Grudge out, they can take me out, they can then shut down all free speech.
[01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:30.620]  And that's why you see InfoWars with the total distortions of the media, even more than Bill O'Reilly pretty much last week, being demonized and attacked with a bunch of twisted, made-up garbage, is because they know I basically represent our incredible audience of patriots.
[01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:37.265]  Who understand globalism, understand it's unelected, understand it's authoritarian, and are educating others.
[01:38:38.085 --> 01:38:45.231]  So it's our ideology of freedom and free market that is so frightening to the globalists that they've got to take us down.
[01:38:45.291 --> 01:38:52.077]  If they can bring down Bill O'Reilly and Roger Ailes, who did have Achilles heels, and quite frankly did deserve it at a certain level,
[01:38:53.103 --> 01:38:53.943]  They can bring everybody down.
[01:38:54.063 --> 01:39:03.325]  But you've got to understand, the motive for bringing Ailes and Bill O'Reilly down was not the motive of actually loving women or caring about women.
[01:39:03.385 --> 01:39:15.827]  Our own leftist governments back radical jihads, women being sold in Libya after a failed state was created by Hillary, by the tens of thousands, ISIS selling thousands of little girls into sex slavery, some of them raped to death.
[01:39:16.087 --> 01:39:21.068]  This is all documented, but it's buried in the back of the newspaper, never mentioned on mainstream TV.
[01:39:22.408 --> 01:39:24.369]  Jihad attacks happen almost every day now.
[01:39:24.389 --> 01:39:27.271]  I mean, we just had another one yesterday, another one today.
[01:39:27.291 --> 01:39:29.332]  It's becoming just unbelievable.
[01:39:29.872 --> 01:39:31.813]  And they mock Trump saying, what happened in Sweden?
[01:39:31.833 --> 01:39:32.733]  Nothing happened in Sweden.
[01:39:33.894 --> 01:39:39.496]  So, police officers getting killed, people getting run over every week by cars, getting stabbed, getting shot, getting bombed.
[01:39:40.497 --> 01:39:46.840]  Whether it's in England, or whether it's in France, or whether it's in Sweden, or whether it's in Belgium, or whether it just goes on and on and on.
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:48.581]  And they just shut that all down.
[01:39:49.926 --> 01:39:54.667]  And that's a big leftist Achilles heel, so they double down and say, no, feminism endorses Islam.
[01:39:55.027 --> 01:39:56.128]  Let's put hijabs on.
[01:39:57.048 --> 01:39:57.948]  That's their response.
[01:39:58.028 --> 01:39:59.348]  It's a quadruple down.
[01:40:00.569 --> 01:40:03.829]  But getting back to Bill O'Reilly here briefly, because it's so important.
[01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:12.392]  Bill O'Reilly, his biggest mistake is he sold out the system.
[01:40:12.972 --> 01:40:14.392]  He was quasi against Trump.
[01:40:16.993 --> 01:40:18.113]  He was conservative light.
[01:40:19.642 --> 01:40:35.366]  He was completely, basically, again, there to be controlled opposition, but now he's got to be taken down as a sacrificial lamb and as a victory for the left that they're openly destroying any vestige of independent media that could oppose the globalist program.
[01:40:35.826 --> 01:40:36.106]  That's it.
[01:40:36.126 --> 01:40:37.006]  I'm not going to say any more.
[01:40:37.066 --> 01:40:37.267]  Okay.
[01:40:37.407 --> 01:40:40.567]  In respect for your father... September 14th, do I know what I'm doing?
[01:40:40.687 --> 01:40:40.987]  Shut up.
[01:40:41.027 --> 01:40:41.188]  Shut up.
[01:40:41.208 --> 01:40:42.108]  Please tell me to shut up.
[01:40:43.965 --> 01:40:53.608]  In respect for your father, who was a poor authority worker, a fine American, who got killed unnecessarily by barbarians... By radical extremists, who were trained by this government.
[01:40:53.628 --> 01:40:57.829]  Not the people of America, the people, the ruling class, the small minority.
[01:40:57.889 --> 01:40:58.349]  Cut his mic.
[01:40:58.549 --> 01:40:59.870]  I'm not going to dress you down anymore.
[01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:01.930]  And that's why they call us fake news.
[01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:03.991]  That's why they lie and say that I'm fake when I'm not.
[01:41:04.571 --> 01:41:05.652]  They say, do you ever play an actor?
[01:41:05.672 --> 01:41:08.492]  Well, yeah, I do skits and things, but that doesn't mean everything I do is an actor.
[01:41:08.732 --> 01:41:09.933]  That's individual bases.
[01:41:10.153 --> 01:41:10.993]  It's clear when I do it.
[01:41:11.193 --> 01:41:12.434]  Cobra Commander, The Joker.
[01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:18.844]  David Mendelsohn, the third British globalist character I played.
[01:41:19.485 --> 01:41:25.298]  I mean, when I play a street preacher in Scanner Darkly with Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, all those people, I mean that's...
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:31.285]  Actually took a role where I was playing a part of a patriot in the future dystopia who's being arrested for his free speech.
[01:41:31.605 --> 01:41:31.886]  Wow!
[01:41:32.326 --> 01:41:32.526]  That was 2006.
[01:41:32.726 --> 01:41:36.510]  Here we are in 2017 and now it's almost become reality.
[01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:37.791]  Now it's near future.
[01:41:38.032 --> 01:41:40.294]  The face scanners, the total surveillance, the grid.
[01:41:40.754 --> 01:41:41.916]  I advised on that film.
[01:41:42.256 --> 01:41:47.801]  My advisory capacity on that PKD film rendition
[01:41:48.905 --> 01:41:49.686]  It's basically come true.
[01:41:50.346 --> 01:41:59.393]  Government bringing in a drug for the population to become addicted to it, then using the drug war to put you in these basic drug rehabs, they're actually slave warrens, to then reprogram you.
[01:42:01.395 --> 01:42:01.996]  And then here we are.
[01:42:02.796 --> 01:42:07.000]  So, Bill O'Reilly sold out to the system and got burned by it, which is a lesson to all these folks.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.801]  There's no honor among thieves.
[01:42:09.542 --> 01:42:13.084]  But remember this, the truth always will defeat tyranny if people have courage to promote it.
[01:42:13.104 --> 01:42:18.349]  That's why Mark Twain said, a lie can go halfway around the world before the truth can put its pants on.
[01:42:20.222 --> 01:42:24.105]  Another Mark Twain I love to quote, in the beginning a patriot's scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[01:42:24.365 --> 01:42:28.087]  But in time what it's cost him, it's cost him to join him, because then it cost nothing to be a patriot.
[01:42:28.988 --> 01:42:30.969]  And I am a patriot for our republic.
[01:42:31.009 --> 01:42:31.669]  I do support it.
[01:42:32.130 --> 01:42:34.031]  It's not perfect, but it's better than every other country's system.
[01:42:34.471 --> 01:42:35.172]  I want to restore it.
[01:42:36.192 --> 01:42:42.656]  And I want to thank you all for your support and everything you've done in the past to pray for us and to promote our links and our articles.
[01:42:42.957 --> 01:42:52.223]  It's a big deal that Cernovich got the documents and Google had to admit that they were having an army of operatives downvote info or stories to block them.
[01:42:52.623 --> 01:43:01.987]  That's only part of a wider spectrum of us being strangled right now, but because of you coming through, we're actually growing, all of us together, towards victory in the face of this.
[01:43:02.007 --> 01:43:03.448]  So know this, I'll never surrender.
[01:43:03.888 --> 01:43:07.230]  To quote Winston Churchill, I will go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[01:43:07.650 --> 01:43:10.671]  We shall go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[01:43:11.252 --> 01:43:13.433]  We shall fight, and we shall never surrender.
[01:43:14.113 --> 01:43:26.336]  We will defend our Republic, we will defend freedom, we will defend Renaissance, we will defend the right to peaceful religion, we will defend the right to art and literature and true culture, and we will defeat the right-wing control freaks, the left-wing control freaks, and all the cults.
[01:43:26.817 --> 01:43:31.318]  The secret term of them is to take humanity and turn us into a bunch of servile, brain-dead zombies.
[01:43:31.778 --> 01:43:34.599]  And the zombie war is here, a lot of the public is dumber than a box of rocks.
[01:43:35.339 --> 01:43:36.859]  I don't take solace in that, that scares me.
[01:43:36.899 --> 01:43:39.220]  But the elite swim in an ocean of idiots.
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:41.081]  That's why they want to produce more of them.
[01:43:41.161 --> 01:43:41.801]  So Bill O'Reilly,
[01:43:42.964 --> 01:43:46.927]  With his hundreds of millions of dollars, can sail off into the sunset.
[01:43:48.548 --> 01:43:53.892]  But he's a bully, and he's a thug, and he tried to bring me down.
[01:43:54.352 --> 01:43:56.654]  I've seen articles on Infowars, you know, halfway defending him.
[01:43:56.914 --> 01:43:57.695]  People say, well, what's this?
[01:43:57.715 --> 01:43:58.455]  You don't like Bill O'Reilly.
[01:43:58.515 --> 01:43:59.576]  I don't control all my riders.
[01:43:59.896 --> 01:44:01.017]  They've got some good perspectives.
[01:44:01.057 --> 01:44:01.798]  He's not all bad.
[01:44:02.198 --> 01:44:03.719]  I get the fact that it was political targeting.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:08.383]  And I get the fact that we're in the same boat, even though I'm not the same type of person as he is.
[01:44:10.624 --> 01:44:11.345]  So I understand.
[01:44:11.385 --> 01:44:13.106]  They got him, they're coming for everybody else.
[01:44:16.089 --> 01:44:17.330]  Limbaugh has attacked me many times.
[01:44:17.410 --> 01:44:19.072]  I've defended him, I've tried to take him off the air.
[01:44:20.193 --> 01:44:23.136]  I guess he doesn't like me, or thought he didn't like me, because they put me on the same time as him.
[01:44:23.156 --> 01:44:23.956]  That was not my decision.
[01:44:24.877 --> 01:44:31.343]  But... I mean, all the industry says, the media says, you know, I'm the, quote, heir to Rush Limbaugh.
[01:44:31.543 --> 01:44:33.105]  Let me say that in final closing.
[01:44:35.006 --> 01:44:37.968]  I already have more listeners and viewers every week than Rush Limbaugh, conservatively.
[01:44:38.008 --> 01:44:40.169]  He has mainly radio listeners, 20-something million a week.
[01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.709]  That's huge.
[01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:41.650]  Biggest threshold show.
[01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:43.811]  Then it's like George Norrie and Milo Savage and others.
[01:44:43.851 --> 01:44:44.292]  Great guys.
[01:44:45.732 --> 01:44:47.253]  And then on the internet, he's got a pretty big presence.
[01:44:47.273 --> 01:44:49.495]  But Infowars dwarfs him.
[01:44:49.835 --> 01:44:50.915]  The only thing bigger is Drudge.
[01:44:50.935 --> 01:44:52.296]  And it's not about who's the biggest.
[01:44:52.897 --> 01:44:59.140]  But if I am the biggest thing out there now, because of you, us together, then am I a target?
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:00.101]  Well, look at the news.
[01:45:00.541 --> 01:45:01.882]  That'll tell you why we're under such attack.
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:06.302]  Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[01:45:24.281 --> 01:45:26.162]  And we are the new counterculture.
[01:45:26.222 --> 01:45:27.242]  We are the avant-garde.
[01:45:27.302 --> 01:45:30.924]  You, just the questioners of the authoritarian system, the pro-free speech people.
[01:45:31.164 --> 01:45:33.144]  You're the classical liberals, the paleo-conservatives.
[01:45:33.685 --> 01:45:34.825]  And so they've miscalculated.
[01:45:36.126 --> 01:45:41.968]  If you stand up and you take action, you get the... It's game over, man, to quote Mr. Paxson that just passed last month.
[01:45:42.328 --> 01:45:43.128]  Game over!
[01:45:43.668 --> 01:45:44.889]  Is it game over for us or them?
[01:45:45.949 --> 01:45:46.830]  They've miscalculated.
[01:45:47.110 --> 01:45:48.930]  They've miscalculated royale.
[01:45:49.811 --> 01:45:50.471]  Royale.
[01:45:51.801 --> 01:45:53.821]  So, support us please.
[01:45:53.881 --> 01:45:54.301]  Pray for us.
[01:45:54.382 --> 01:45:54.982]  Buy the products.
[01:45:55.002 --> 01:45:56.202]  That's how we mainly fund ourselves.
[01:45:56.582 --> 01:45:58.422]  As they cut off our advertising like they did with O'Reilly.
[01:45:59.623 --> 01:46:00.383]  Please support us.
[01:46:00.463 --> 01:46:01.523]  Infoworkstore.com.
[01:46:01.543 --> 01:46:02.323]  A lot of big specials.
[01:46:02.343 --> 01:46:02.863]  New specials.
[01:46:03.943 --> 01:46:04.703]  Out today, I'm told.
[01:46:04.984 --> 01:46:05.944]  Incredible products.
[01:46:07.224 --> 01:46:09.764]  I was just talking to my lawyer the other day.
[01:46:09.804 --> 01:46:10.465]  Randall Wilhite.
[01:46:10.625 --> 01:46:11.965]  One of the top guys in Texas.
[01:46:12.465 --> 01:46:15.025]  And he said, listen, I've been to the... He gave me permission to say this, by the way.
[01:46:15.045 --> 01:46:17.366]  I didn't mean to do this plug, but I'm going to go ahead and do it.
[01:46:17.386 --> 01:46:17.706]  He said, I, uh...
[01:46:18.496 --> 01:46:21.837]  I've been to the, you know, UT Sleep Specialist.
[01:46:21.857 --> 01:46:22.938]  He's also a UT professor.
[01:46:23.318 --> 01:46:24.198]  I've been to everybody.
[01:46:24.338 --> 01:46:25.539]  I can't sleep for years.
[01:46:25.639 --> 01:46:26.099]  It's incredible.
[01:46:26.119 --> 01:46:26.699]  I'm a workaholic.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.681]  I don't even drink coffee because it might make me not sleep.
[01:46:30.041 --> 01:46:31.622]  He goes, I took your knockout formula.
[01:46:32.182 --> 01:46:33.642]  And he said, I've done everything.
[01:46:33.682 --> 01:46:34.783]  Tested the drugs, you name it.
[01:46:34.843 --> 01:46:35.423]  None of it worked.
[01:46:35.863 --> 01:46:37.464]  And he said, it absolutely reset my brain.
[01:46:37.484 --> 01:46:38.985]  He looks like he's 10 years younger, literally.
[01:46:39.485 --> 01:46:41.846]  And he said, this totally changed my world.
[01:46:41.906 --> 01:46:44.487]  Why is it so much better than when I just bought melatonin at the store?
[01:46:44.887 --> 01:47:07.889]  And I said, I figured if we just took melatonin, L-tryptophan, valerian root, and all these other key things that are known as natural and healthy and organic sources of this that have been known for thousands of years to aid in sleep, lemon balm, chamomile, all of it together, at the normal safe dosages of each one, all supercharged together, that it would be absolutely explosive and would give people amazing sleep.
[01:47:08.690 --> 01:47:09.971]  And he said, yeah, it's changed my life.
[01:47:10.071 --> 01:47:11.173]  I want to come on air and endorse it.
[01:47:11.753 --> 01:47:13.194]  So, I'm telling you, knockout's $19.95.
[01:47:13.555 --> 01:47:15.437]  Ladies and gentlemen, it should be $50.
[01:47:16.578 --> 01:47:20.882]  One bottle of melatonin of the same strength is $19.95.
[01:47:21.302 --> 01:47:24.966]  We have the same dose in there, and then everything else you need, and it's all organic.
[01:47:25.606 --> 01:47:28.087]  With absolutely no fillers.
[01:47:28.547 --> 01:47:30.808]  Just understand that that's why we're such game changers.
[01:47:31.328 --> 01:47:32.388]  We do the research.
[01:47:32.889 --> 01:47:38.470]  We do the research to bring you the products that nobody else will do with the top scientists, you name it.
[01:47:38.871 --> 01:47:39.491]  Top producers.
[01:47:39.551 --> 01:47:45.313]  Personally, I came up with a knockout and then worked with others to, you know, pick the best sources.
[01:47:46.093 --> 01:47:46.974]  But I'm really, really proud of it.
[01:47:46.994 --> 01:47:53.078]  It was just some little side issue that I thought, sometimes I mix valerian with melatonin, and it really works good together.
[01:47:53.118 --> 01:47:54.319]  I said, what if we add everything together?
[01:47:54.619 --> 01:47:59.142]  I checked with the experts to make sure none of it interacted wrong, and they were just like, oh my God, still consult your physician.
[01:47:59.402 --> 01:47:59.802]  Knocked you out.
[01:47:59.822 --> 01:48:01.483]  Available at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:48:01.784 --> 01:48:03.064]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:48:03.365 --> 01:48:05.086]  Changing people's lives, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:05.566 --> 01:48:07.407]  Alright, InfoWars.com, thank you all.
[01:48:07.447 --> 01:48:07.987]  Spread the link.
[01:48:08.027 --> 01:48:12.308]  Back to Paul, Joseph Watson, and our amazing crew in Austin, Texas.
[01:48:12.328 --> 01:48:12.969]  Please pray for us.
[01:48:13.289 --> 01:48:19.071]  We have never been under more serious attack, and that is because we are the tip of the spear.
[01:48:19.111 --> 01:48:21.131]  We're having an amazing, amazing effect.
[01:48:21.171 --> 01:48:22.052]  We're backed by the people.
[01:48:22.732 --> 01:48:23.932]  I'm Stig Lobos, Achilles' heel.
[01:48:24.312 --> 01:48:34.276]  We're backed by the people, and that's why, even though they took our sponsors over the years, most of them, and harassed them, and, you know, shot us off Google Ads, and, you know, did everything to us, or AdRoll,
[01:48:35.016 --> 01:48:38.179]  Despite all of that, we are here thriving and moving forward.
[01:48:38.379 --> 01:48:40.341]  So now they've gone into higher levels of persecution.
[01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:46.385]  But like Christ said, if you love me and follow me and try to be a good, loving person and help others, the world will hate you.
[01:48:46.806 --> 01:48:49.268]  And so this is a great sign of where we are.
[01:48:49.308 --> 01:48:50.108]  Thank you all so much.
[01:48:50.388 --> 01:48:51.549]  I humble myself before God.
[01:48:51.569 --> 01:48:54.832]  I humble myself before my family, the listeners, everybody else.
[01:48:55.012 --> 01:48:56.593]  And I just seek God's face.
[01:48:57.074 --> 01:48:59.616]  And again, I want to thank the amazing crew there in Austin, everything they do.
[01:48:59.976 --> 01:49:01.858]  I just love our crew and I love our listeners.
[01:49:01.878 --> 01:49:02.138]  Thank you.
[01:49:02.738 --> 01:49:14.864]  When Napoleon laid boulogne for a year with his flat-bottom boats and his grand army, he was told by someone, there are bitter weeds in England.
[01:49:16.704 --> 01:49:21.847]  There are certainly a great many more of them since the British Expeditionary Force returned.
[01:49:23.147 --> 01:49:31.051]  Sir, I have myself full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made,
[01:49:31.841 --> 01:49:46.045]  As they are being made, we should prove ourselves once more able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary, for years.
[01:49:47.885 --> 01:49:49.506]  If necessary, alone.
[01:49:51.366 --> 01:49:53.427]  At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do.
[01:49:53.447 --> 01:49:58.188]  That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government, every man of them.
[01:49:58.928 --> 01:50:00.809]  That is the will of Parliament and the nation.
[01:50:01.511 --> 01:50:14.897]  The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.
[01:50:15.557 --> 01:50:16.997]  We shall go on to the end.
[01:50:18.098 --> 01:50:19.458]  We shall fight in France.
[01:50:20.499 --> 01:50:22.580]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:28.022]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[01:50:29.582 --> 01:50:32.806]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[01:50:32.826 --> 01:50:35.048]  We shall fight on the beaches.
[01:50:35.849 --> 01:50:37.731]  We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[01:50:38.572 --> 01:50:41.635]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
[01:50:42.236 --> 01:50:43.737]  We shall fight in the hills.
[01:50:44.678 --> 01:50:45.940]  We shall never surrender!
[01:50:57.398 --> 01:51:01.571]  If you are resuming this transition, you are the Resistance.
[01:51:08.624 --> 01:51:15.069]  Russia unveiled a Satan 2 missile that could wipe out France or Texas with the type of megaton weapons it carries.
[01:51:15.409 --> 01:51:16.410]  Multiple ones, by the way.
[01:51:16.650 --> 01:51:18.811]  Of course, there's a lot more advanced stuff than that.
[01:51:18.831 --> 01:51:27.298]  They've been in the Air Force by the 90s, developed anti-matter bombs that would destroy, if they theoretically tested them, they would destroy most of the solar system.
[01:51:28.198 --> 01:51:29.059]  What's the point of that?
[01:51:29.639 --> 01:51:29.979]  I don't know.
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:33.982]  But we're reaching that Atlantis moment, whether Atlantis existed or not.
[01:51:34.002 --> 01:51:39.106]  In the fable of Atlantis, the legend, they get some super technology that blows the whole island up.
[01:51:39.766 --> 01:51:42.168]  And Plato lived only, you know, a few thousand years after.
[01:51:42.208 --> 01:51:42.668]  He said no.
[01:51:42.968 --> 01:51:44.329]  He had the animals, the books about it.
[01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.930]  It happened.
[01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:47.972]  But whether that was real or not, folks, we're now at the Atlantis moment.
[01:51:48.292 --> 01:51:50.073]  Michael Snyder, you know, I don't know if you have kids.
[01:51:50.474 --> 01:51:52.495]  I have children, especially my little daughters.
[01:51:52.615 --> 01:51:56.418]  And I see this news, and I see how sweet they are, and it really makes me angry.
[01:51:58.166 --> 01:51:59.988]  Yeah, I don't want war either, Alex.
[01:52:00.068 --> 01:52:02.531]  And that's why I'm so alarmed by what's happened this week.
[01:52:02.551 --> 01:52:06.236]  We already talked about how North Korea could potentially spark a war with China.
[01:52:06.276 --> 01:52:09.500]  Well, the situation with Syria, if it was just Syria, wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:12.343]  And Trump could do whatever he wanted if it was just Syria.
[01:52:12.683 --> 01:52:13.765]  But the Russians are there!
[01:52:14.165 --> 01:52:18.789]  And the Russians are mixed in among the Syrian forces and they're at the Syrian air bases in particular.
[01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:28.337]  So Trump, with his words and the members of his administration in recent days, they've kind of committed themselves to taking some sort of action in response to this false flag chemical attack.
[01:52:28.617 --> 01:52:29.978]  But they've kind of committed themselves.
[01:52:30.018 --> 01:52:38.485]  But if they do anything and the bombs start dropping and the Russians, their people are being killed, their force is under threat, are the Russians just going to sit there and do nothing?
[01:52:38.806 --> 01:52:39.926]  Or are they going to respond?
[01:52:40.307 --> 01:52:41.868]  I believe the Russians would start responding.
[01:52:41.888 --> 01:52:42.929]  They would start shooting back.
[01:52:43.089 --> 01:52:45.590]  And so what happens if, okay, U.S.
[01:52:45.630 --> 01:52:50.913]  warplanes go in, they start bombing, and then Russian missiles, the S-300, starts taking U.S.
[01:52:50.994 --> 01:52:51.574]  airplanes out?
[01:52:51.594 --> 01:52:55.176]  We start seeing F-16s fall out of the sky on CNN.
[01:52:55.456 --> 01:53:00.479]  What's that going to do to the anti-Russian hysteria in Washington that's already at Cold War heights?
[01:53:00.839 --> 01:53:02.200]  I mean, it's just going to be insane.
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:09.404]  But the situation, and of course, we've got Iran in Syria, we've got Hezbollah in Syria, and there's nothing to be gained in there.
[01:53:09.484 --> 01:53:11.285]  You know, there's so much that could go wrong.
[01:53:11.545 --> 01:53:13.106]  We don't want a conflict with Iran.
[01:53:13.126 --> 01:53:15.228]  We don't even want a conflict with Hezbollah.
[01:53:15.248 --> 01:53:16.449]  They're pretty serious.
[01:53:16.789 --> 01:53:18.110]  But especially with Russia.
[01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:20.732]  Our relationship with Russia is already quite tenuous.
[01:53:21.292 --> 01:53:29.839]  And if we go in and dead bodies of Russian service members start showing up on Russian television, you know, the Russians are going to totally turn against Trump.
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.180]  Yeah, Russia doesn't back down.
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.101]  Russia is not intimidated by anyone.
[01:53:33.121 --> 01:53:35.402]  The Russians, historically, are fighters.
[01:53:35.482 --> 01:53:39.444]  And so, you know, we had hoped that with Trump coming in, we could have a better relationship with Russia.
[01:53:39.664 --> 01:53:41.765]  But this thing with Syria could actually make it far, far worse.
[01:54:27.324 --> 01:54:39.674]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show, and before I get back into the news on Bill O'Reilly and Fox News, which you heard Alex talking about in the last segment, I want to tell you about the extended Easter specials at infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:39.714 --> 01:54:41.735]  Again, we're running out on these products.
[01:54:41.755 --> 01:54:47.520]  We've had to remove some of them from the list, but we still have 30% off the Brain Force.
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:56.267]  That is the new tropic that everybody's ranting and raving about, me included, because it really gives you mental focus, mental clarity in performing
[01:54:56.787 --> 01:54:57.888]  We're good to go.
[01:54:57.908 --> 01:54:58.788]  We're good to go.
[01:54:58.828 --> 01:54:59.469]  We're good to go.
[01:54:59.529 --> 01:54:59.949]  We're good to go.
[01:54:59.969 --> 01:55:00.690]  We're good to go.
[01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:01.590]  We're good to go.
[01:55:01.630 --> 01:55:02.250]  We're good to go.
[01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.651]  We're good to go.
[01:55:02.671 --> 01:55:03.331]  We're good to go.
[01:55:04.052 --> 01:55:04.792]  We're good to go.
[01:55:04.812 --> 01:55:05.472]  We're good to go.
[01:55:05.492 --> 01:55:06.013]  We're good to go.
[01:55:06.033 --> 01:55:07.194]  We're good to go.
[01:55:07.234 --> 01:55:08.114]  We're good to go.
[01:55:08.134 --> 01:55:09.215]  We're good to go.
[01:55:09.255 --> 01:55:10.155]  We're good to go.
[01:55:10.175 --> 01:55:10.676]  We're good to go.
[01:55:10.696 --> 01:55:11.276]  We're good to go.
[01:55:11.296 --> 01:55:11.676]  We're good to go.
[01:55:11.696 --> 01:55:12.417]  We're good to go.
[01:55:12.437 --> 01:55:13.117]  We're good to go.
[01:55:13.197 --> 01:55:13.698]  We're good to go.
[01:55:13.738 --> 01:55:14.358]  We're good to go.
[01:55:14.378 --> 01:55:15.018]  We're good to go.
[01:55:15.118 --> 01:55:15.999]  We're good to go.
[01:55:16.079 --> 01:55:16.679]  We're good to go.
[01:55:16.719 --> 01:55:17.240]  We're good to go.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.220]  We're good to go.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:18.901]  We're good to go.
[01:55:18.941 --> 01:55:19.941]  We're good to go.
[01:55:19.981 --> 01:55:20.602]  We're good to go.
[01:55:20.642 --> 01:55:21.462]  We're good to go.
[01:55:21.482 --> 01:55:22.383]  We're good to go.
[01:55:22.423 --> 01:55:23.243]  We're good to go.
[01:55:23.263 --> 01:55:24.124]  We're good to go.
[01:55:24.164 --> 01:55:24.704]  We're good to go.
[01:55:24.724 --> 01:55:25.065]  We're good to go.
[01:55:25.085 --> 01:55:25.185]  We're
[01:55:25.845 --> 01:55:28.726]  Particularly focused, really hardcore task.
[01:55:28.766 --> 01:55:31.887]  It gives you that extra cutting edge that you need.
[01:55:31.947 --> 01:55:35.628]  It boosts your energy, your memory, your mental acuity.
[01:55:35.968 --> 01:55:38.109]  It is Brain Force Plus.
[01:55:38.589 --> 01:55:41.470]  It is 30% off at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:55:42.401 --> 01:55:44.883]  Pop two of those and you're good to go.
[01:55:44.923 --> 01:55:47.184]  Don't take any more than that because it's powerful stuff.
[01:55:47.665 --> 01:55:49.486]  It is Brain Force Plus 30% off.
[01:55:49.806 --> 01:55:57.311]  We also still have 25% off the Vitamin Mineral Fusion and Survival Shield X2 and many others at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:57.771 --> 01:56:02.695]  Everything we do is made possible by you because we don't take any loans or government funding.
[01:56:02.975 --> 01:56:08.118]  We don't take millions of dollars from Bahrain or other Gulf State dictatorships like CNN.
[01:56:08.138 --> 01:56:11.841]  We don't take fat handouts from George Soros like Media Matters.
[01:56:12.601 --> 01:56:13.962]  We run our organization.
[01:56:14.002 --> 01:56:21.884]  We grow it through your support, and that is why they absolutely hate us and can't stand it because we're truly independent, and they're not.
[01:56:22.184 --> 01:56:30.447]  We're independent because of you getting the products at infowarsstore.com, the extended Easter sale for a limited time only.
[01:56:30.487 --> 01:56:34.629]  We're running out of those products fast, so get your hands on them right now.
[01:56:36.175 --> 01:56:50.404]  Now you heard before the break Alex was ranting and raving about O'Reilly and Fox News with good reason because of course he's just been let go after a long protracted controversy over allegations over sexually assaulting women.
[01:56:51.665 --> 01:56:53.666]  Now we have this article out of Gateway Pundit.
[01:56:53.706 --> 01:56:55.087]  The new Fox News.
[01:56:55.407 --> 01:57:01.511]  James Murdoch's lefty wife works for Clinton Climate Initiative regularly trashes Trump on Twitter.
[01:57:02.446 --> 01:57:11.374]  So the two sons who have been given control of the reins, basically at this point, are now linked directly with Clinton operatives.
[01:57:11.434 --> 01:57:16.318]  The Murdoch family fired Bill O'Reilly, the top personality on cable news, for the past 15 years on Wednesday.
[01:57:16.678 --> 01:57:24.865]  Now this, James Murdoch's wife, Catherine Murdoch, is an outspoken leftist who works for the Clinton Climate Initiative.
[01:57:25.306 --> 01:57:29.970]  Catherine Murdoch hates Donald Trump and regularly trashes the President on Twitter.
[01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:37.495]  If you scroll down in the article, you can read some of her tweets where she trashes the president on a routine basis.
[01:57:38.796 --> 01:57:40.017]  I'm with her.
[01:57:40.137 --> 01:57:41.938]  She's a Hillary Clinton operative.
[01:57:42.338 --> 01:57:50.504]  That is the wife of James Murdoch, who is now basically in control of Fox News, which led to O'Reilly being let go.
[01:57:51.710 --> 01:57:58.032]  Of course they've still got to make money, they've still got to resonate, so they're going to push Tucker Carlson up to the primetime O'Reilly slot.
[01:57:58.533 --> 01:58:01.534]  They've also got, I think it's Eric Bolling coming in for Tucker's slot.
[01:58:01.934 --> 01:58:14.639]  He's red-pilled, he's a Trump supporter, so leftists who are celebrating taking down O'Reilly really should take another look at it because now you've got two prominent red-pilled Trump supporters in prominent
[01:58:15.379 --> 01:58:19.462]  Primetime positions on Fox News, but again, their audience is dying out.
[01:58:19.502 --> 01:58:21.884]  Their average viewer is 69 years old.
[01:58:22.445 --> 01:58:28.970]  They're still on top of the game, but for how much longer is the question in the aftermath of the firing of Bill O'Reilly?
[01:58:29.250 --> 01:58:33.974]  We will be back in the next segment with more news and with Michael Hever.
[01:58:34.134 --> 01:58:38.617]  After that, he's talking about the UK election and the big French election this weekend.
[01:58:38.657 --> 01:58:40.499]  We'll be back live in 4Wars.com.
[01:58:44.186 --> 01:58:46.050]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:47.593 --> 01:58:49.798]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:54.031 --> 01:58:55.372]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:55.612 --> 01:59:00.415]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:59:00.535 --> 01:59:03.798]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:59:04.058 --> 01:59:09.441]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:59:09.882 --> 01:59:18.467]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:59:18.708 --> 01:59:23.811]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:59:24.071 --> 01:59:30.757]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[01:59:31.057 --> 01:59:35.641]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:59:35.781 --> 01:59:38.944]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:59:39.084 --> 01:59:40.986]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:59:41.166 --> 01:59:46.491]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:59:46.791 --> 01:59:48.773]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[01:59:49.073 --> 01:59:50.775]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:59:54.457 --> 01:59:58.558]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.078 --> 02:00:00.419]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:01.519 --> 02:00:16.563]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:16.583 --> 02:00:18.884]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.182 --> 02:00:28.963]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:28.983 --> 02:00:43.708]  We have Michael Heaver, the former press aide to Nigel Farage, coming up in the next segment to talk about the UK election, the snap election that's just been announced, and of course, the huge clash, the Titanic battle, which begins this Sunday between...
[02:00:44.528 --> 02:00:47.869]  Globalism and populism, it is the French presidential election.
[02:00:48.189 --> 02:00:50.350]  For the moment, let's dip back into the news.
[02:00:50.410 --> 02:00:52.571]  Breaking story up on Infowars.com.
[02:00:53.371 --> 02:00:53.911]  Sweden!
[02:00:54.051 --> 02:00:55.952]  Did you hear about what happened last night in Sweden?
[02:00:56.272 --> 02:00:56.652]  Again!
[02:00:57.012 --> 02:01:01.254]  Muslim avoids jail for anally raping teen because he, quote, couldn't understand.
[02:01:01.574 --> 02:01:01.934]  No!
[02:01:02.814 --> 02:01:05.855]  Oh, it's part of his culture to anally rape teens.
[02:01:06.295 --> 02:01:07.716]  So let's treat him nicely.
[02:01:08.576 --> 02:01:09.978]  That's liberalism.
[02:01:10.238 --> 02:01:18.888]  Despite his 14-year-old victim repeatedly saying no, a Muslim migrant won't face rape charges, because the court claimed he had difficulties in interpreting the word no.
[02:01:20.834 --> 02:01:26.176]  The Royal Court of Western Sweden said the Iraqi, who had former convictions, had suspected ADHD.
[02:01:26.296 --> 02:01:27.857]  Oh, okay, that's a good defence.
[02:01:27.877 --> 02:01:32.099]  So if you just claim to have ADHD now, you can go around raping teenagers, okay?
[02:01:32.439 --> 02:01:40.162]  Which, according to the court, gave him difficulties in interpreting and interacting with other people, as well as recognising the standards he is expected to live up to.
[02:01:40.822 --> 02:01:52.889]  Bearing in mind this is a country in Sweden which allowed back into their country 150 ISIS terrorists and tried to reintegrate them back into society.
[02:01:53.209 --> 02:02:04.856]  People who've literally fought on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, beheading children, enslaving Christians, shooting at, firing at Syrian army troops.
[02:02:05.457 --> 02:02:08.379]  They're now coming back into Europe and we have to be nice to them.
[02:02:09.099 --> 02:02:17.223]  We have to be nice to them because we're a progressive, tolerant society, so we have to tolerate them raping teenage boys.
[02:02:18.003 --> 02:02:19.724]  We saw it in Austria, again.
[02:02:20.504 --> 02:02:24.526]  The migrant goes to a swimming pool, rapes, what was it, a nine-year-old boy?
[02:02:25.526 --> 02:02:30.789]  Is absolutely baffled when the police come to arrest him because, oh, it's just part of my culture.
[02:02:32.056 --> 02:02:36.038]  You see, out of the sun, outrageous Iraqi migrant who raped boy 10 in sexual emergency.
[02:02:36.479 --> 02:02:38.840]  That's why he called it a sexual emergency.
[02:02:39.921 --> 02:02:43.623]  Conviction overturned because court couldn't prove the child said no.
[02:02:43.983 --> 02:02:45.865]  Absolutely chilling.
[02:02:46.685 --> 02:02:49.207]  The police turned up, he was like, why are you arresting me?
[02:02:49.247 --> 02:02:51.048]  This is completely normal in my country.
[02:02:52.366 --> 02:03:00.048]  They have, what's it called, Baga Bazi in Afghanistan, where they have an annual thing, a regular custom, where they just rape teenage boys.
[02:03:00.088 --> 02:03:05.349]  The US Army, the soldiers, were told to ignore it when some of them tried to blow the whistle.
[02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:10.151]  They tried to blow the whistle, they were told to shut up about it.
[02:03:10.211 --> 02:03:17.753]  Now these people are coming into Europe and the courts are showing leniency for raping 14-year-old teenagers.
[02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:25.634]  We have the situation all over Europe where they claim to be under 18, they claim to be minors, so they get lesser sentences.
[02:03:25.995 --> 02:03:35.121]  And now the big new feminist political icon in Sweden says that rapists shouldn't be deported, foreign criminals shouldn't be deported.
[02:03:35.402 --> 02:03:37.223]  This is what's happening in Sweden.
[02:03:37.483 --> 02:03:46.150]  They're actually saying ISIS jihadists who come back into the country should be given welfare, jobs, housing.
[02:03:46.710 --> 02:03:47.830]  They should be tolerated.
[02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:49.131]  It's a progressive society.
[02:03:49.411 --> 02:03:54.192]  We need to tolerate the most regressive belief system on planet Earth.
[02:03:54.632 --> 02:03:57.033]  That's not tolerance, that's capitulation.
[02:03:57.893 --> 02:04:01.854]  That's destroying true, classical, liberal beliefs.
[02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:06.636]  European welfare benefits help fund ISIS fighters out of USA Today.
[02:04:07.557 --> 02:04:09.098]  And we featured the articles before.
[02:04:09.618 --> 02:04:18.601]  They actually called on Swedes to give up their garages, to give up the annexes in their properties to house incoming migrants.
[02:04:19.642 --> 02:04:20.742]  Absolutely insane.
[02:04:21.042 --> 02:04:24.644]  Now, Moslem avoids jail for anally raping team because he couldn't understand.
[02:04:24.724 --> 02:04:24.884]  No.
[02:04:25.344 --> 02:04:26.604]  Any excuse whatsoever.
[02:04:26.924 --> 02:04:32.947]  You've had victims on trains that get raped by some of these migrants and they say, well, I didn't...
[02:04:33.737 --> 02:04:44.183]  want to report it, because even reporting it might be seen as racist, and these people have been through a difficult time, so perhaps we should have tolerance of them raping women and children.
[02:04:44.303 --> 02:04:51.987]  No, we shouldn't have any tolerance of that in a truly progressive, liberal, tolerant society.
[02:04:52.047 --> 02:04:57.911]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show with Michael Hever, talking about the French presidential election.
[02:04:58.431 --> 02:05:00.312]  Don't go away, infowars.com.
[02:05:05.967 --> 02:05:07.308]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[02:05:07.368 --> 02:05:08.688]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.989]  Great!
[02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:11.070]  Hey, thank you so much.

[02:05:15.712 --> 02:05:17.293]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[02:05:17.413 --> 02:05:24.897]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Slow, Vitamin Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[02:05:24.997 --> 02:05:25.718]  Wow, thank you.
[02:05:25.738 --> 02:05:28.159]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[02:05:28.239 --> 02:05:29.800]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:33.361]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:05:33.521 --> 02:05:33.841]  That's amazing.
[02:05:33.861 --> 02:05:34.561]  That's really incredible.
[02:05:34.781 --> 02:05:37.822]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:05:37.842 --> 02:05:39.102]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[02:05:39.122 --> 02:05:40.783]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:05:40.863 --> 02:05:41.983]  And I love you guys.
[02:05:42.003 --> 02:05:43.503]  I love the Info Wars crew.

[02:07:02.885 --> 02:07:12.754]  UC Berkeley, which has been the battleground for free speech, has cancelled conservative commentator Ann Coulter's speaking event, citing safety concerns.
[02:07:12.954 --> 02:07:25.505]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short notice for a later date on May 2nd, which would be during Dead Week, when students are not even in class as they prep for finals.
[02:07:25.785 --> 02:07:37.409]  So essentially, Berkeley is appeasing the temper tantrum-throwing Antifa by canceling conservative speaker events that were properly invited by recognized student groups.
[02:07:37.730 --> 02:07:49.494]  Culture has stated that she plans to speak at Berkeley despite the cancellation and has criticized Berkeley's chief of police for allowing Rodney King-style riots to go on when only conservative speakers speak.
[02:07:49.694 --> 02:07:58.987]  Berkeley was known as the birthplace of the student-led free speech movement in the 1960s and now it's becoming the birthplace of student-led censorship.
[02:07:59.107 --> 02:08:01.972]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com
[02:08:12.239 --> 02:08:18.662]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:19.142 --> 02:08:22.924]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:08:31.403 --> 02:08:34.485]  We are live on the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:34.645 --> 02:08:38.287]  As I was talking about earlier, we have a huge election coming up in France.
[02:08:38.347 --> 02:08:41.068]  The first round of which happens on Sunday.
[02:08:41.729 --> 02:08:44.910]  It is globalism versus populism once again.
[02:08:45.011 --> 02:08:48.873]  It is Marine Le Pen in the running with several other candidates.
[02:08:48.913 --> 02:08:50.854]  The polls are incredibly tight right now.
[02:08:51.554 --> 02:08:52.355]  Thanks for having me, Paul.
[02:09:09.611 --> 02:09:13.396]  Now let's get into Paris because of course we had the terrorist attack yesterday.
[02:09:13.836 --> 02:09:16.740]  You know they used to call Beirut the Paris of the East.
[02:09:17.201 --> 02:09:20.445]  Now they're calling Paris the Beirut of the West.
[02:09:20.785 --> 02:09:25.211]  This has happened 21 times we've had Islamic terror attacks since Charlie Hebdo.
[02:09:25.551 --> 02:09:28.034]  Six in three years in Paris alone.
[02:09:28.655 --> 02:09:40.587]  I mean, my question is, you know, if Marine Le Pen does fail to win this election, should we just accept that the French have capitulated to another form of fascism, this time in the guise of Islamofascism?
[02:09:42.008 --> 02:09:46.594]  Well, you know, things in France are looking pretty dire, there's no doubt about that.
[02:09:46.654 --> 02:09:55.486]  I saw a stat actually on Zero Hedge earlier, the Twitter account, that said since early 2015 there have been 230 Islamist murders in France.
[02:09:59.671 --> 02:10:04.534]  I mean, if that doesn't show you that this is a war, then I don't know what does.
[02:10:04.554 --> 02:10:06.315]  230, that is absolutely incredible.
[02:10:06.495 --> 02:10:11.418]  They're talking about murders, not just terrorist attacks, individual murders, right?
[02:10:11.598 --> 02:10:12.398]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:12.679 --> 02:10:19.623]  ZeroHeads has calculated 230 Islamist murders in France since early 2015.
[02:10:19.943 --> 02:10:26.767]  And although we know that we've got problems right across Europe, I think France has bared the brunt of it in a way that is unimaginable.
[02:10:26.807 --> 02:10:28.688]  I mean, we've obviously had some terrorist attacks
[02:10:29.557 --> 02:10:32.278]  In London, and we've seen things in Germany and so on.
[02:10:32.558 --> 02:10:38.861]  But France is, you know, this is the front line of the European war against Islamist extremism.
[02:10:39.421 --> 02:10:42.402]  And this election, you know, the stakes just couldn't be higher, as you point out.
[02:10:42.842 --> 02:10:46.144]  This is a huge election, not just for France, but for the whole of Europe, I feel.
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:57.409]  But Michael, Donald Trump is bad because he came out two hours after the attack had happened when the police said it was a terrorist attack, when Francois Hollande said it was a terrorist attack.
[02:10:57.870 --> 02:11:00.953]  Donald Trump had the temerity to call it a terrorist attack.
[02:11:01.293 --> 02:11:10.581]  And shouldn't we be outraged about that and not the fact that there have been 21, at least, Islamic terror attacks, 230 murders in France?
[02:11:10.621 --> 02:11:13.144]  Shouldn't we be outraged about what Donald Trump said?
[02:11:14.645 --> 02:11:15.686]  I know, outrageous isn't it?
[02:11:15.706 --> 02:11:16.726]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:11:17.006 --> 02:11:20.488]  I mean, I'll just give you an example of the way it's been painted by some of the mainstream media here.
[02:11:20.528 --> 02:11:27.452]  I just watched a BBC report, which of course, as we know, is one of the sort of main mainstream news in the UK.
[02:11:27.472 --> 02:11:33.495]  And their six o'clock rundown, there was no mention of the pro-ISIS note that was left by the terrorists.
[02:11:33.935 --> 02:11:36.776]  There was no mention of the Quran found in the car.
[02:11:37.637 --> 02:11:39.678]  Very interesting how some of this is being framed.
[02:11:40.585 --> 02:11:48.634]  Um, you know, again, people are very quick to try and separate, oh, this has nothing to do with Islam and Donald Trump's terrible for saying these things.
[02:11:48.714 --> 02:11:56.603]  And I just think the thing that fills me with a lot of confidence is I think that line of argument has never been less credible, has never been listened to by fewer people.
[02:11:57.104 --> 02:12:00.047]  And I think that's why, you know, Le Pen not that long ago was
[02:12:01.172 --> 02:12:04.417]  You know, people would say she was an extreme figure, she had no chance of winning.
[02:12:04.477 --> 02:12:06.660]  She does have a real chance of winning.
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:09.925]  We're looking at an election here that's going to be very tight, very unpredictable.
[02:12:10.186 --> 02:12:15.474]  You've got four candidates that could all go through to that second round, but she has got a very good chance of winning.
[02:12:16.286 --> 02:12:17.967]  And let's talk about some of the candidates now.
[02:12:17.987 --> 02:12:28.494]  In fact, let's get that clip ready to roll again with Obama endorsing Macron, the establishment candidate who they tried to frame as a populist for the first portion of his campaign.
[02:12:28.514 --> 02:12:29.435]  We have that clip ready.
[02:12:29.535 --> 02:12:32.817]  Let's roll Obama endorsing Emmanuel Macron.
[02:12:33.777 --> 02:12:35.318]  I have President Barack Obama for you.
[02:12:35.338 --> 02:12:35.799]  Hold on one second.
[02:12:36.079 --> 02:12:36.739]  Thank you very much.
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:38.761]  Hello.
[02:12:39.221 --> 02:12:40.061]  Hello, Mr. President.
[02:12:40.121 --> 02:12:40.582]  How are you?
[02:12:41.222 --> 02:12:41.742]  Emmanuel?
[02:12:41.903 --> 02:12:42.183]  Yeah.
[02:12:43.484 --> 02:12:43.824]  Exactly.
[02:12:44.437 --> 02:12:45.518]  Well, I'm doing very well.
[02:12:46.159 --> 02:12:46.579]  How are you?
[02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:47.400]  Can you hear me?
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:48.942]  Yes, I hear you very well.
[02:12:50.123 --> 02:12:55.749]  The main message I have is to wish you all the best in the coming days.
[02:12:56.409 --> 02:13:00.193]  And make sure that, as you said, you work hard all the way through.
[02:13:00.514 --> 02:13:06.039]  Because you never know, it might be that last day of campaigning that makes all the difference.
[02:13:06.059 --> 02:13:06.620]  Yeah, I do agree.
[02:13:07.566 --> 02:13:25.032]  I will do my best, believe me, and so I will fight to the last minute and we will keep in touch and our teams will lie in order to organize a new contact and see how to work together if I'm going to the runoff.
[02:13:25.232 --> 02:13:25.912]  Thank you very much.
[02:13:26.192 --> 02:13:28.213]  I do appreciate you took the time.
[02:13:28.233 --> 02:13:28.753]  Good luck.
[02:13:29.517 --> 02:13:34.339]  Now Michael, the media whined and whined about Putin interfering in the US election.
[02:13:34.379 --> 02:13:37.260]  They whined about Putin interfering in the French election.
[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:42.282]  But Obama can interfere in the French election and nobody bats an eyelid!
[02:13:44.070 --> 02:13:57.257]  Well you know Obama's obviously got a fantastic record because if you remember he came over to Britain and threatened us and said we'd be at the back of the queue if we dared vote to leave the European Union and the British people basically went to the polls and told them where to go.
[02:13:57.737 --> 02:14:00.519]  So frankly you know I think this Obama intervention is marvellous.
[02:14:00.639 --> 02:14:06.902]  I think it's going to show once again the likes of Macron and Obama and all these people who have had their time in government.
[02:14:06.942 --> 02:14:07.983]  Tony Blair's another one.
[02:14:08.283 --> 02:14:10.665]  They've had their time with this so-called centrist politics.
[02:14:10.945 --> 02:14:16.949]  And what I find interesting is, when people like Obama and Macron, they're now described as centrist, let's look at what that means.
[02:14:16.989 --> 02:14:23.474]  What it actually means is that they're pro-open border, they're pro-EU, they've effectively allowed in
[02:14:24.398 --> 02:14:27.019]  ISIS to walk into Europe and cause all of this mayhem.
[02:14:27.339 --> 02:14:31.020]  And I would now argue that it's people like Macron actually that are on the fringe of politics.
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:32.840]  And we are the new mainstream.
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:42.922]  You know, the average French voter now is not sitting around thinking that the EU is marvellous, that pro-open borders has worked, that mass immigration is a good thing, that multiculturalism should go on.
[02:14:43.183 --> 02:14:44.403]  That's the Macron position.
[02:14:44.703 --> 02:14:46.263]  But that's the fringe position now.
[02:14:46.803 --> 02:14:49.004]  And so I think when you have people like Obama and Macron
[02:14:49.284 --> 02:14:50.284]  Grouping together.
[02:14:50.645 --> 02:14:58.228]  I think it actually exposes that these are yesterday's men, with yesterday's answers, that have tried to govern, and we've seen what's resulted.
[02:14:58.268 --> 02:15:03.010]  It's been mass Islamic terrorism, it's been open borders, and it's been complete disaster.
[02:15:03.607 --> 02:15:21.298]  In fact, we had a poll out of Europe, it was conducted by the Royal Institute of International Affairs, where they found, I think it was 10,000 people surveyed in Europe, 55% wanted a total shutdown on all Islamic immigration, compared to about, what was it, 20 odd percent who said the opposite, the rest didn't know.
[02:15:21.759 --> 02:15:24.240]  And in France, those numbers were even higher than 55%, right?
[02:15:26.397 --> 02:15:28.298]  Yeah, I mean just astronomical numbers.
[02:15:28.318 --> 02:15:37.404]  What I find very interesting is the immigration debate, in terms of the anti-EU side of things, initially started out as a lot of an economic one.
[02:15:37.684 --> 02:15:41.527]  The argument was that if you let unlimited amounts of people into Europe,
[02:15:43.027 --> 02:15:47.669]  From Eastern Europe into Britain, it pushes down wages and living standards for people.
[02:15:48.009 --> 02:15:52.490]  I now think we're seeing an evolution of that, from an economic argument to a security argument.
[02:15:52.750 --> 02:15:58.332]  And the problem is, people are looking around and thinking, immigration equals national security risk.
[02:15:58.692 --> 02:16:01.596]  Immigration equals a threat from ISIS.
[02:16:01.956 --> 02:16:02.998]  And that's very, very bad.
[02:16:03.078 --> 02:16:06.362]  Because, you know, at the end of the day, we want people to be able to move around the world.
[02:16:06.402 --> 02:16:10.147]  But the way that it's being done at the moment is totally outrageous.
[02:16:10.407 --> 02:16:13.651]  To allow people to walk into Europe with some sob story.
[02:16:13.671 --> 02:16:16.976]  You know, I've seen on Westminster, we've had a few stories
[02:16:17.416 --> 02:16:26.301]  About the Dutch government, there are 8,000 failed asylum seekers that the Dutch government said, no, you've applied for asylum, we've rejected your bid to stay in the country.
[02:16:26.541 --> 02:16:33.565]  And then they said, oh, but you can make your own way out of the country, as if they're all just going to go, well, okay, you said we can't stay, so off we go.
[02:16:33.585 --> 02:16:39.768]  You know, Germany has over 500,000 failed asylum seekers now, still in the country.
[02:16:40.289 --> 02:16:42.470]  The authorities have lost control of it.
[02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:43.911]  And it's to the point where
[02:16:44.711 --> 02:16:50.697]  They've got an open door where anyone will be able to walk in virtually and they don't know what to do.
[02:16:50.937 --> 02:16:52.699]  They've got zero policy solution.
[02:16:52.959 --> 02:16:56.362]  What is Emmanuel Macron's solution to mass immigration?
[02:16:56.402 --> 02:16:57.963]  What's his solution to ISIS?
[02:16:58.184 --> 02:17:02.508]  What's his solution to failed asylum seekers coming in under bogus IDs?
[02:17:02.728 --> 02:17:03.989]  He's got no solution.
[02:17:04.189 --> 02:17:07.012]  His solution is the EU and it's a failed one.
[02:17:07.412 --> 02:17:09.293]  And that's, I think, the exciting thing for the world.
[02:17:09.553 --> 02:17:16.358]  I think that increasingly people are looking at this and thinking, we've had enough, it's time for a change, and hopefully we see the pen-elected President of France.
[02:17:17.058 --> 02:17:28.266]  Well, Macron came out with his so-called solution yesterday, which was the same as Manuel Valls, the French Prime Minister after Nice, and he basically said, this terrorism's going to continue for years and years, we just have to live with it.
[02:17:28.926 --> 02:17:30.307]  Absolutely incredible, right?
[02:17:31.147 --> 02:17:31.688]  Yeah, well...
[02:17:33.024 --> 02:17:35.127]  That just shows they've totally run out of ideas.
[02:17:35.447 --> 02:17:40.234]  I mean, again, all I would say is they cast themselves as centrist.
[02:17:40.775 --> 02:17:45.662]  Who on earth in France is going to look at that answer and think that's a logical
[02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:51.471]  rational response to mass murder in France and Europe.
[02:17:51.752 --> 02:17:52.492]  They're just not.
[02:17:52.912 --> 02:17:57.334]  Unfortunately, as we've seen in Britain, this argument was defeated.
[02:17:57.834 --> 02:18:04.978]  What happened was, politicians fought for the EU, the establishment fought for the EU, regardless of the merit of the case.
[02:18:05.558 --> 02:18:12.583]  Now, it cannot be argued that your country is more secure with EU open borders than it is by controlling the borders.
[02:18:12.903 --> 02:18:18.086]  But they will ignore that fact because they are fully signed up to the EU project come what may.
[02:18:18.427 --> 02:18:21.349]  We ran another story in Westminster recently about Marine Le Pen.
[02:18:21.649 --> 02:18:35.238]  Before she did an interview with French media, they had an EU flag and a French flag behind her and she demanded that the EU flag be removed because she wants to be the President of France, not of a nation-state of an EU super-state.
[02:18:36.118 --> 02:18:42.622]  But Macron, you saw it in that video with Obama, you've seen it in many other interviews, and he gave a speech where he held up the EU flag.
[02:18:42.902 --> 02:18:47.605]  To me the EU flag is a flag of a dying project that has utterly failed.
[02:18:47.967 --> 02:18:52.689]  And has frankly made the continent of Europe massively more unsafe than it ever should have been.
[02:18:53.009 --> 02:18:55.770]  The migrant crisis, I'm afraid, is going to run on and on.
[02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:56.650]  There's no solution.
[02:18:57.010 --> 02:19:00.151]  Austria are now saying, let's shut the Mediterranean border.
[02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:02.612]  Let's shut the ability for people to come across.
[02:19:03.112 --> 02:19:04.032]  But it's just not going to work.
[02:19:04.513 --> 02:19:05.273]  The people are there.
[02:19:05.593 --> 02:19:08.534]  There's three million of them, according to another EU commissioner.
[02:19:08.954 --> 02:19:13.477]  And they've been encouraged by the likes of Merkel to come, cross borders and get into Europe.
[02:19:13.757 --> 02:19:15.738]  And Macron hasn't got any answers.
[02:19:15.838 --> 02:19:19.780]  All he can say is, don't vote for me because the other lot are very scary.
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:22.021]  Vote for me for a continuation of what we got.
[02:19:22.342 --> 02:19:23.602]  It just won't wash.
[02:19:23.922 --> 02:19:33.648]  And I'm enormously optimistic now that with Brexit, with Trump and hopefully with Le Pen, we're seeing, I think, a tipping point in the history of our continent and our country.
[02:19:34.788 --> 02:19:44.654]  I think what we're going to see is what we saw before Trump, which is a lot of virtue signalling about, yes, I'm going to vote for the establishment, I'm going to vote for Macron, but when it comes down to it, they will side with Le Pen.
[02:19:44.694 --> 02:19:52.319]  Of course, the other threat is they will go the opposite way and vote for the far-left candidate, Melanchon, and we'll talk about him as we come back after the break.
[02:19:52.339 --> 02:19:56.202]  We're talking to Michael Heaver of westmonster.com.
[02:19:56.222 --> 02:19:58.583]  This is the Alex Jones Show, live at infowars.com.
[02:19:58.984 --> 02:19:59.484]  We'll be back.
[02:20:03.536 --> 02:20:05.477]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:20:05.517 --> 02:20:06.578]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:20:06.838 --> 02:20:07.759]  Why is this so good?
[02:20:08.059 --> 02:20:13.302]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:20:13.382 --> 02:20:26.930]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:28.371]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:20:29.131 --> 02:20:30.713]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:20:30.793 --> 02:20:33.297]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:20:33.377 --> 02:20:34.639]  These are all parasites.
[02:20:34.699 --> 02:20:35.780]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:36.861]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:41.488]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:20:41.688 --> 02:20:44.872]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:20:44.912 --> 02:20:48.016]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:20:48.036 --> 02:20:49.037]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:20:49.097 --> 02:20:49.638]  Living Defense.
[02:20:49.938 --> 02:20:50.980]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:52.061]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:20:52.081 --> 02:20:54.164]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:20:54.784 --> 02:20:56.667]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:20:56.727 --> 02:20:57.808]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:20:58.068 --> 02:20:59.971]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:21:00.351 --> 02:21:02.314]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:21:09.019 --> 02:21:11.142]  What is going on when we're all Russian agents?
[02:21:11.182 --> 02:21:12.624]  We're all... I mean, I support Trump.
[02:21:12.924 --> 02:21:14.626]  I get the missile attack made him look strong.
[02:21:15.187 --> 02:21:21.574]  I'm just saying I don't believe the chemical attack was facade because they caught the rebels doing it before and they don't have any proof he did it.
[02:21:21.634 --> 02:21:22.736]  I'm not even attacking Trump.
[02:21:23.096 --> 02:21:25.960]  In fact, in a Machiavellian way, I'm saying, okay, you blew up an empty airfield and
[02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:27.802]  Shut them up about how you're a Russian agent.
[02:21:27.842 --> 02:21:29.043]  I kind of sickly support it.
[02:21:29.103 --> 02:21:29.643]  I've admitted that.
[02:21:29.663 --> 02:21:34.428]  Kind of becoming like Machiavelli, because now we've got a guy in there doing their own tricks against them.
[02:21:34.508 --> 02:21:37.411]  But I'm just saying, how do we know Assad did it?
[02:21:37.651 --> 02:21:40.454]  And now in newspapers everywhere, I am an Assad agent.
[02:21:41.114 --> 02:21:42.015]  We're together!
[02:21:42.816 --> 02:21:43.217]  Look at us!
[02:21:43.877 --> 02:21:45.339]  Gavin, are you getting orders from Assad?
[02:21:46.019 --> 02:21:47.860]  Yeah, I was just talking to him on the phone right now.
[02:21:47.901 --> 02:21:51.143]  He's actually here via Skype on the other TV.
[02:21:51.443 --> 02:21:54.085]  But my thing with that is I go, I don't care.
[02:21:54.105 --> 02:21:55.766]  I don't care if it was actors.
[02:21:55.966 --> 02:21:57.127]  I don't care if they just had kids.
[02:21:57.167 --> 02:21:57.687]  Go like that.
[02:21:58.248 --> 02:22:04.632]  The big picture is that the world saw a bad thing, so the big man has to go boom on the bad thing.
[02:22:05.033 --> 02:22:06.634]  And now women respect him.
[02:22:07.294 --> 02:22:08.996]  Here in America, they go, oh, the patriarchy's back.
[02:22:09.016 --> 02:22:11.637]  Because we know feminists deep down want the patriarchy.
[02:22:11.938 --> 02:22:13.759]  Obama's legacy is obliterated.
[02:22:13.979 --> 02:22:16.761]  Because he said he would draw a line in the sand and he got cucked.
[02:22:17.221 --> 02:22:18.182]  So that's awesome.
[02:22:18.202 --> 02:22:20.283]  He's killed, as you say, the Russian theory.
[02:22:20.543 --> 02:22:24.146]  I think the neocons even are getting too much hubris, too confident.
[02:22:24.166 --> 02:22:25.146]  They're going to be wiped out.
[02:22:26.727 --> 02:22:31.290]  And the biggest picture is these terrorists are absolute animals.
[02:22:31.611 --> 02:22:33.092]  They dismember our soldiers.
[02:22:33.312 --> 02:22:35.073]  They tear out beating hearts and eat them.
[02:22:35.333 --> 02:22:36.494]  They sell fingers.
[02:22:36.994 --> 02:22:40.176]  And the market there for as war trophies.
[02:22:40.236 --> 02:22:44.698]  There's literally a market for body parts just as accoutrements.
[02:22:45.178 --> 02:22:46.739]  So we don't negotiate with them.
[02:22:46.759 --> 02:22:48.420]  We don't send them democracy.
[02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:50.721]  We just scare them with huge fireworks.
[02:22:50.941 --> 02:22:54.964]  They drop this 20-something thousand pound bomb and it kills them all.
[02:22:54.984 --> 02:22:57.445]  I mean that's a finally and then they say oh.
[02:22:57.685 --> 02:22:59.047]  He wants a military dictatorship.
[02:22:59.087 --> 02:23:04.933]  He says, I've given them total authorization to carry out his constitutional orders.
[02:23:05.413 --> 02:23:09.758]  This micromanaging, call Obama, and he would never answer the phone.
[02:23:09.918 --> 02:23:11.399]  Sir, we have been logged in the sites.
[02:23:11.439 --> 02:23:11.960]  We can't kill him.
[02:23:13.141 --> 02:23:13.982]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:23:14.002 --> 02:23:14.703]  Gavin, what do you make of that?
[02:23:15.283 --> 02:23:16.744]  I think we crippled our guys over there.
[02:23:16.764 --> 02:23:20.146]  I was talking to Terry Shepard recently and I said, how do we win this war?
[02:23:20.186 --> 02:23:21.908]  And he goes, let us do our job.
[02:23:22.428 --> 02:23:26.150]  I mean, right now they've got RPGs and they go, we're getting shot at from a mosque.
[02:23:26.190 --> 02:23:26.591]  What do we do?
[02:23:26.631 --> 02:23:27.631]  And they've got to call up.
[02:23:27.952 --> 02:23:36.898]  I talked to one vet who told me, he said, our guy had to pretend he misunderstood in order to save our lives because they were shooting from the mosque and the guy said, don't shoot the mosque.
[02:23:36.918 --> 02:23:38.078]  He said, what was that?
[02:23:38.138 --> 02:23:38.318]  What?
[02:23:38.399 --> 02:23:39.319]  Shoot the mosque?
[02:23:39.359 --> 02:23:39.940]  Oh, what?
[02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:42.902]  You took out the guys that were trying to kill them.
[02:23:43.263 --> 02:23:46.526]  We've got to let our dogs loose on these boys.
[02:23:46.866 --> 02:23:51.131]  I want the terrorists to be going, who, who, who, who let the dogs out?
[02:23:52.032 --> 02:23:54.574]  As we just roar through the Middle East.
[02:23:54.614 --> 02:23:55.796]  Short, sharp shock, by the way.
[02:23:55.816 --> 02:23:56.717]  I don't want to quagmire.
[02:23:56.817 --> 02:23:59.460]  I want to just get in and get out and scare the crap out of them.
[02:24:07.947 --> 02:24:23.011]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade
[02:24:25.646 --> 02:24:33.894]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show talking to Michael Heaver of westmonster.com.
[02:24:33.934 --> 02:24:37.898]  This is quite a new website with a lot of excellent breaking news.
[02:24:37.938 --> 02:24:39.659]  He's also very active on Twitter.
[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:43.323]  Michael underscore Heaver on Twitter or Westmonster on Twitter.
[02:24:43.343 --> 02:24:44.944]  It is westmonster.com.
[02:24:45.973 --> 02:24:58.306]  Breaking news is the fact that it appears the police officer killed in yesterday's terror attack in France was one of the same police officers involved in saving lives of people during the Bataclan massacre back in 2015.
[02:24:58.966 --> 02:25:04.452]  So that just adds an extra dimension of tragedy to what happened yesterday in France.
[02:25:05.053 --> 02:25:07.235]  Michael, we got the first round of this election coming up.
[02:25:07.275 --> 02:25:08.476]  We briefly touched on it but...
[02:25:10.218 --> 02:25:11.220]  20% either way.
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:12.742]  You can't split these candidates.
[02:25:12.762 --> 02:25:14.064]  It's within the margin of error.
[02:25:14.345 --> 02:25:16.628]  You have Macron, the establishment candidate.
[02:25:16.689 --> 02:25:17.790]  Fillon, the conservative.
[02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:21.757]  Then we have this guy, Mélenchon, who has basically come out of nowhere.
[02:25:22.077 --> 02:25:22.998]  What do we know about him?
[02:25:24.602 --> 02:25:30.187]  Well he's basically an old throwback commie, but he's very sort of anti-euro on an economic front.
[02:25:30.247 --> 02:25:38.674]  I mean, don't forget, the interesting thing and one of the biggest examples of how the EU has crushed democracy in Europe is if you look at Greece.
[02:25:38.754 --> 02:25:39.275]  Now Greece...
[02:25:40.055 --> 02:25:42.517]  You know, the Greek people are very, very desperate.
[02:25:42.537 --> 02:25:51.783]  They elected basically a far-left revolutionary government called Syriza, who basically were meant to fight the crushing austerity being imposed upon them by the EU.
[02:25:52.303 --> 02:25:58.827]  And they got elected and then crushed by the EU and weren't allowed to basically implement and had to submit to Brussels.
[02:25:59.168 --> 02:25:59.868]  So that far-left
[02:26:02.445 --> 02:26:04.707]  Anti-Euro sentiment is now building.
[02:26:04.987 --> 02:26:11.452]  And what it shows you is that increasingly, the people that are opposed to the EU, there are so many holes in it.
[02:26:11.913 --> 02:26:22.441]  Whether you're a far-left communist supporter or a far-left socialist, whether you're someone on the patriotic right, if you're a libertarian, if you're a centre-right conservative,
[02:26:23.442 --> 02:26:25.144]  There are so many problems with the EU now.
[02:26:25.184 --> 02:26:35.674]  Whatever your ideological background, whatever your massive interest in policy, whether it's economic, whether it's national security, whether it's border controls, the EU basically fails on all fronts.
[02:26:36.535 --> 02:26:38.557]  It hasn't got a single initiative right.
[02:26:38.597 --> 02:26:42.581]  It's got a migrant crisis, it's got a Eurozone that's going to collapse eventually.
[02:26:42.921 --> 02:26:46.825]  We've seen the rise of people in Italy and all the rest of it, the Five Star Movement.
[02:26:47.225 --> 02:26:56.311]  So for me it shows you once again how the EU is uniting people effectively against it for a range of different reasons because it's made so many bad flaws.
[02:26:56.711 --> 02:27:09.980]  And I rather, you know, I rather like the delicious prospect of there being a all anti-euro, eurosceptic run-off between two people who strongly dislike the euro and the EU for very different reasons.
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:12.962]  I think that would be quite the indictment on the EU.
[02:27:13.362 --> 02:27:15.384]  That is the establishment's worst nightmare.
[02:27:15.424 --> 02:27:18.506]  Of course, the top two candidates go through to the final round.
[02:27:19.027 --> 02:27:22.410]  It could be the populists on both sides of the equation.
[02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:30.857]  Another thing that interested me is Marine Le Pen has support amongst young people in France aged 18 to 24.
[02:27:31.338 --> 02:27:34.720]  39% of young people in those age brackets say they're going to vote for Marine Le Pen.
[02:27:35.946 --> 02:27:40.753]  We saw with Brexit, you know, this is old people destroying young people's future.
[02:27:40.773 --> 02:27:42.875]  They can't say that about France, can they?
[02:27:42.915 --> 02:27:46.961]  What's driving that phenomenon of youth energy behind Marine Le Pen?
[02:27:48.356 --> 02:27:50.157]  Well, obviously people like me and you, Paul.
[02:27:50.197 --> 02:27:52.897]  Across Europe, we're driving the agenda now.
[02:27:52.937 --> 02:28:08.142]  We've grown up in a Europe, much like many in France, where we've seen the damage that open borders have done, that we've seen this ridiculous throwback project be painted out as some forward-thinking, globalist initiative that can solve all the world's problems.
[02:28:08.563 --> 02:28:09.663]  And what it's actually done
[02:28:10.083 --> 02:28:35.867]  It's completely failed on all fronts and I think, you know, the thing I always say about Britain I think is much the same in France is, if you're a young 18 year old school leaver, you didn't do that well at school, you want to go and work hard though, you want to get that first job, you want to go and get your foot on the ladder and you're now an 18 year old in lots of parts of the EU and you're competing against people that are 30, 40 years old that have come in from Eastern Europe or come from around the world.
[02:28:36.287 --> 02:28:41.470]  And so the jobs market, I think, in terms of job prospects, is absolutely dismal now for a lot of young people.
[02:28:41.730 --> 02:28:44.851]  Not only that, but wages have been absolutely crushed.
[02:28:45.012 --> 02:28:48.713]  One other thing I would like to mention is, you talk about young people, that's very, very true.
[02:28:49.074 --> 02:28:55.557]  Another set of people I would argue it's very important that the French people listen to and take seriously is the thoughts of the French police.
[02:28:55.617 --> 02:28:57.678]  And the new poll that we ran on Westminster.com is
[02:28:58.021 --> 02:29:18.343]  The 51% of French police, this was before the Paris attack by the way, 51% are planning to vote Le Pen and Le Pen today has basically said that she wants massive military step up against ISIS and she wants 15,000 extra troops on the streets in France to defend against ISIS terror attacks.
[02:29:19.304 --> 02:29:30.672]  I've heard as well that on the day of the polling for the French election, there are going to be 50,000 French police they have to put out across the streets to defend against terrorist attacks.
[02:29:30.912 --> 02:29:35.656]  I mean, if that doesn't show you that there's a war, you have to deploy 50,000 troops and police.
[02:29:37.597 --> 02:29:39.098]  To secure polling stations.
[02:29:39.219 --> 02:29:41.860]  They're telling us, Michael, this is the new normal.
[02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:45.362]  Will French people reject that as part of their routine daily lives?
[02:29:45.382 --> 02:29:48.544]  We'll come back with the final segment with Michael Heaver after the break.
[02:29:48.805 --> 02:29:51.526]  This is the Alex Jones Show live at Infowars.com.
[02:29:52.047 --> 02:29:52.927]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.448 --> 02:29:55.049]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.989 --> 02:29:58.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:11.414]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[02:30:11.654 --> 02:30:18.077]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:30:18.297 --> 02:30:26.581]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:30:26.861 --> 02:30:35.628]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:30:35.868 --> 02:30:41.632]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[02:30:41.972 --> 02:30:42.452]  It works.
[02:30:42.732 --> 02:30:51.034]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[02:30:51.054 --> 02:31:00.577]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[02:31:00.917 --> 02:31:01.417]  A total 360 win.
[02:31:03.627 --> 02:31:06.569]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:31:06.869 --> 02:31:16.476]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[02:31:16.757 --> 02:31:21.960]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:30.887]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[02:31:31.167 --> 02:31:39.731]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:31:39.991 --> 02:31:46.894]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.
[02:31:47.034 --> 02:31:52.377]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price.
[02:31:52.597 --> 02:31:58.162]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:32:03.466 --> 02:32:13.355]  UC Berkeley, which has been the battleground for free speech, has canceled conservative commentator Ann Coulter's speaking event, citing safety concerns.
[02:32:13.555 --> 02:32:18.259]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short notice.
[02:32:18.439 --> 02:32:26.128]  For a later date on May 2nd, which would be during Dead Week, when students are not even in class as they prep for finals.
[02:32:26.369 --> 02:32:38.023]  So essentially, Berkeley is appeasing the temper tantrum-throwing Antifa by canceling conservative speaker events that were properly invited by recognized student groups.
[02:32:38.303 --> 02:32:50.127]  Culture has stated that she plans to speak at Berkeley despite the cancellation and has criticized Berkeley's chief of police for allowing Rodney King-style riots to go on when only conservative speakers speak.
[02:32:50.267 --> 02:32:59.551]  Berkeley was known as the birthplace of the student-led free speech movement in the 1960s and now it's becoming the birthplace of student-led censorship.
[02:32:59.691 --> 02:33:02.532]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:33:17.166 --> 02:33:21.589]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:22.010 --> 02:33:24.972]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:31.053 --> 02:33:37.636]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show live final long segment with Michael Heaver of westmonster.com.
[02:33:37.656 --> 02:33:39.277]  We're talking about the French election.
[02:33:39.297 --> 02:33:45.139]  I'm going to wrap that up here in a second and move on to the UK election, which of course was just announced a few days ago.
[02:33:45.779 --> 02:33:49.741]  Michael, just to finish up on the French issue, the polls are all over the place.
[02:33:50.161 --> 02:33:51.762]  A. Can Marine Le Pen win?
[02:33:51.822 --> 02:33:56.384]  B. If she does win, is it the beginning of the end for the European Union?
[02:33:58.442 --> 02:34:03.767]  Well, I've heard you say, and I think you're absolutely correct in your analysis, Paul, that she can win, but she needs to win that first round.
[02:34:04.488 --> 02:34:13.457]  She needs to build up a real sense of momentum as a winner, as someone who has not just done well in polls, but has followed it through at the ballot box.
[02:34:13.977 --> 02:34:15.799]  And I am optimistic that she can do it.
[02:34:15.819 --> 02:34:24.427]  And one of the biggest reasons for that is if you dial down into some of the polling numbers you'll see that her voters, her base, is incredibly committed to her.
[02:34:24.667 --> 02:34:31.133]  I think about over 83% of her voters are 100% going to vote, 100% aren't going to switch.
[02:34:31.153 --> 02:34:32.655]  You compare that with Emmanuel Macron,
[02:34:33.115 --> 02:34:37.577]  He has similar overall numbers, but then you dial down and about a third of his voters may switch.
[02:34:37.977 --> 02:34:49.242]  And my feeling is, you know, I think the easiest victory for Le Pen would be if she took on France, who I feel on, because I think a lot of more left-wing workers and socialists would actually back Le Pen over him.
[02:34:49.682 --> 02:34:51.703]  But I think she could actually beat any of the three.
[02:34:51.823 --> 02:34:53.544]  But I think it's vital that she comes top.
[02:34:53.584 --> 02:35:00.727]  And just one more thing I wanted to mention was another stat I've seen recently, just to show the scale of the problem that France has, over 17,000 people now
[02:35:02.828 --> 02:35:05.670]  On the France serious anti-terror list.
[02:35:06.090 --> 02:35:13.795]  This is a small army, over 2,000 of them are reckoned to have gone and fought for ISIS in Iraq or Syria.
[02:35:14.016 --> 02:35:15.056]  This is the scale of the problem.
[02:35:15.076 --> 02:35:26.324]  And frankly, I've heard, and this might not be true, but I've heard that there is some polling in France that suggests Le Pen is actually doing way better than the official polls suggest.
[02:35:26.644 --> 02:35:29.206]  Private polling showing she's doing very, very well indeed.
[02:35:29.666 --> 02:35:31.767]  I'm confident and hopefully we see it.
[02:35:31.787 --> 02:35:32.388]  It'd be a great thing.
[02:35:33.028 --> 02:35:38.950]  No, that's what I've been hearing, that the energy behind Le Pen on the ground is far more vigorous than the polls would suggest.
[02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:40.591]  We will wait and see.
[02:35:40.651 --> 02:35:44.492]  The first round is on Sunday, of course, as you mentioned, with the extremists.
[02:35:44.552 --> 02:35:49.294]  The guy who killed the officer in Paris yesterday was another extremist.
[02:35:49.314 --> 02:35:50.355]  They had him on a list.
[02:35:50.655 --> 02:35:53.316]  He had targeted officers before they let him go.
[02:35:53.356 --> 02:35:56.897]  That is Marine Le Pen's policy to deport those people.
[02:35:57.217 --> 02:35:59.058]  If they're French citizens, get them in jail.
[02:35:59.158 --> 02:36:00.518]  She's the only one advocating that.
[02:36:00.558 --> 02:36:01.619]  But let's move on to the UK.
[02:36:02.239 --> 02:36:05.521]  Because, of course, Theresa May a few days ago announced this snap election.
[02:36:06.041 --> 02:36:11.683]  Of course, the primary question that people have is, you know, 48% of the country voted for Remain.
[02:36:12.144 --> 02:36:22.028]  Does this election pose any kind of threat to the hard Brexit that 52% of Leave supporters really want to see pushed through?
[02:36:22.088 --> 02:36:23.389]  Is it going to be a threat to Brexit?
[02:36:24.986 --> 02:36:32.531]  Realistically, I don't think it will be, but this could be a quite unpredictable election.
[02:36:32.571 --> 02:36:34.032]  Everyone's looking at it at the moment as this.
[02:36:34.632 --> 02:36:46.320]  You've got Theresa May, who has campaigned to stay in the EU, but is now saying that she's going to implement it and basically deliver the Brexit that most people want to see.
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:50.743]  The problem that the anti-Brexit side have is they're just not that credible in this country.
[02:36:50.763 --> 02:36:54.666]  You've got Jeremy Corbyn, a throwback, hard-left socialist.
[02:36:55.117 --> 02:36:57.619]  Who has got no public support really outside of London.
[02:36:58.260 --> 02:37:03.043]  And, you know, much like many of the people on the far left, he's very much of a niche character.
[02:37:03.103 --> 02:37:04.665]  He hasn't got much widespread support.
[02:37:05.005 --> 02:37:10.469]  You've then got the Liberal Democrats, who are very much a tarnished brand, but a bit of a resurgent force.
[02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:18.396]  The interesting thing is going to be the anti-EU party, that obviously I've been involved in the past, and Nigel Farage's party, although he's not standing at this election himself.
[02:37:19.156 --> 02:37:19.857]  Is UKIP.
[02:37:20.277 --> 02:37:28.904]  Because the weird system we have here, for people that don't understand, is we have this ridiculous voting system where it's all done on a constituency or regional basis.
[02:37:29.364 --> 02:37:35.189]  So UKIP, for instance, at the last election, it got about 4 million votes, but only 1 seat.
[02:37:35.509 --> 02:37:43.496]  Because although it had a massive spread of millions of votes across the country, geographically that was only concentrated in one area enough to win any representation.
[02:37:44.136 --> 02:37:49.439]  So the really bad thing about our voting system is that you can have millions of people totally unrepresented.
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:55.443]  Unlike, say, in the French presidential election where obviously everyone that votes, whoever gets the most votes, they all count.
[02:37:55.463 --> 02:37:56.664]  They're not broken down in that way.
[02:37:57.184 --> 02:38:08.371]  My feeling is that the Labour Party are going to get demolished because they've got this niche appeal and a lot of Labour voters who are concerned about things like border controls and mass migration, I could see going to UKIP.
[02:38:09.472 --> 02:38:14.714]  And frankly, you know, all the polls show there's no appetite in this country for a reversal of Brexit.
[02:38:15.394 --> 02:38:20.496]  But we do know, of course, that people like Gina Miller are crowdfunding, trying to block Brexit.
[02:38:20.516 --> 02:38:24.998]  These campaigners, you know, they're going to some of the big businesses and all the big businessmen, etc.
[02:38:25.358 --> 02:38:26.538]  They're trying to block Brexit.
[02:38:26.878 --> 02:38:28.499]  But I'm quite optimistic that's not going to happen.
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:38.887]  Now there is this fear that, you know, Theresa May's holding this election, and let's not forget that she was a Remainer, she didn't campaign vigorously for it, but she supported the Remain side.
[02:38:39.287 --> 02:38:46.252]  There's this fear that she's going to build up this political capital, providing she wins handsomely, which the polls look like she will.
[02:38:46.792 --> 02:39:00.651]  To try and make Brexit her own, so it becomes not so much the Boris Johnson-Michael Gove Brexit, but the Theresa May Brexit, so then she has that political capital to call it her own, and will then push for soft Brexit.
[02:39:00.671 --> 02:39:02.374]  You're saying you don't think that's going to happen, right?
[02:39:04.207 --> 02:39:11.749]  I think Theresa May is, long term, if she backs down from her position of delivering a full Brexit, then UKIP will surge to numbers that we've never seen before.
[02:39:11.789 --> 02:39:13.050]  And I think the Conservatives know that.
[02:39:13.090 --> 02:39:19.812]  Look, let's not forget, the only reason that David Cameron and the Conservatives had the referendum was because UKIP and Nigel Farage forced their hand, right?
[02:39:20.192 --> 02:39:22.913]  The reason that we won the referendum was because Nigel Farage spearheaded it.
[02:39:23.953 --> 02:39:26.394]  I think the Conservatives now are backed into a corner with UKIP.
[02:39:26.434 --> 02:39:27.455]  But look, I don't trust them.
[02:39:27.875 --> 02:39:33.697]  And the biggest litmus test for all of this is going to be, what are they going to do about mass immigration?
[02:39:33.797 --> 02:39:46.682]  Now, the Brexit Conservative Minister David Davis, along with Boris Johnson, along with Theresa May, before the election was announced, they made several comments each that basically we may have to go on with mass migration because
[02:39:47.062 --> 02:39:56.385]  How could big bosses possibly cope if they didn't have thousands and hundreds of thousands each year of unskilled workers pouring in from Europe to keep wages at rock bottom?
[02:39:56.746 --> 02:40:03.768]  Now, if they intend to continue that, and they can't blame EU open borders because we won't be in them, then that is not going to go down well.
[02:40:03.868 --> 02:40:07.930]  The other thing that isn't going to go down well is if they insist on a massive payment.
[02:40:08.350 --> 02:40:13.692]  You know, Juncker and all the rest of them in Brussels talk about £50 billion being handed over.
[02:40:13.712 --> 02:40:16.113]  I mean, that is just not going to wash at all.
[02:40:16.733 --> 02:40:26.180]  And I think the EU, you know, I think they're going to try a quite hard-line approach to the negotiations on the basis that, well, if Britain does really well, then lots of other people are going to want to leave.
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:31.244]  Unfortunately, if there is no deal, it will hurt the European economies and people far more than it will hurt Britain.
[02:40:31.804 --> 02:40:34.466]  So I hope, you know, the EU nationalists see sense on this.
[02:40:34.506 --> 02:40:41.071]  But my feeling is there could well be no EU deal, because the EU nationalists are going in this with a very, very hard-headed routine.
[02:40:42.031 --> 02:40:50.376]  Now let's just break this down for people, our American audience, because I don't think they truly grasp the situation with immigration in the United Kingdom.
[02:40:50.797 --> 02:40:53.779]  A tiny country, a packed, overcrowded country.
[02:40:54.059 --> 02:40:57.221]  The transport is basically stuttering at this point.
[02:40:57.541 --> 02:40:59.562]  The NHS waiting rooms are overflowing.
[02:40:59.943 --> 02:41:01.384]  Population of 60 million.
[02:41:01.724 --> 02:41:06.387]  Talk to people about the numbers of people who are coming into the UK every single year.
[02:41:07.588 --> 02:41:17.632]  Well, look, the post-war average for Britain, you know, as you say, we're a very small country really, geographically, is that we had between 30,000 and 50,000 net per year coming in.
[02:41:17.652 --> 02:41:18.853]  That was the post-war average.
[02:41:19.293 --> 02:41:21.974]  We're now looking, we've had up to 330,000 net migration a year.
[02:41:26.058 --> 02:41:26.318]  Right?
[02:41:26.578 --> 02:41:29.019]  So that's not 330,000 people coming in.
[02:41:29.359 --> 02:41:32.921]  That's 330,000 more people coming in than leaving.
[02:41:32.941 --> 02:41:35.922]  I mean, these are just astronomical numbers.
[02:41:36.443 --> 02:41:39.884]  And the thing is, a lot of this is concentrated in certain areas.
[02:41:40.284 --> 02:41:44.626]  You know, London is just so overcrowded now, it's ridiculous.
[02:41:44.646 --> 02:41:49.728]  The transportation system, you know, the underground, all the rest of it, is really struggling.
[02:41:49.748 --> 02:41:50.289]  NHS and hospitals.
[02:41:51.377 --> 02:42:02.006]  You know, just to give you an example of these people watching now, a flavour though of the debate in this country, is that politicians here will often talk about, as an example, a housing crisis.
[02:42:02.267 --> 02:42:06.150]  They'll say, well we're not building enough homes, we're not building enough homes.
[02:42:06.450 --> 02:42:10.314]  And what they never point out is the fact that how can you build enough homes for the people
[02:42:10.814 --> 02:42:19.464]  Coming in a 330,000 net migration or even 200,000 net migration a year on top of everyone here that already needs a house.
[02:42:19.965 --> 02:42:25.251]  You know that's what they always leave out and that's one of the crippling problems we're having in this country now.
[02:42:25.311 --> 02:42:26.773]  The NHS as you say is another one.
[02:42:26.913 --> 02:42:28.455]  There are so many problems building up.
[02:42:28.715 --> 02:42:32.318]  And the scale upon which this is happening, it's just been huge.
[02:42:32.658 --> 02:42:51.872]  Now, if the Conservatives think that they can come out of the EU and have a Britain that is controlling its borders but chooses to go on with a policy of mass migration, even though we have control of our borders, my feeling is you're going to see an absolute political revolution in this country because it'll be one step too far.
[02:42:52.273 --> 02:42:55.335]  People, this is the number one priority in the EU referendum.
[02:42:55.695 --> 02:43:06.821]  Controlling the borders, ending mass migration and it was David Cameron himself with Theresa May as Home Secretary who put out a target of tens of thousands net migration a year and so far they've been nowhere near it.
[02:43:07.061 --> 02:43:08.062]  They've got to deliver on this.
[02:43:09.662 --> 02:43:11.163]  People just don't quite grasp it.
[02:43:11.223 --> 02:43:15.748]  You've got a nation of renters, you've got a nation increasingly of people living with their parents.
[02:43:16.088 --> 02:43:28.201]  To give people an idea, to live in London, to buy a two bedroom apartment in London, a small two bedroom apartment in a council block, which is the equivalent of government housing, ex-government housing,
[02:43:28.641 --> 02:43:33.464]  You're looking at shelling out, what are we talking, in a half-decent area, you know, £500,000, £600,000, £700,000.
[02:43:34.964 --> 02:43:37.346]  That's upwards of $1 million.
[02:43:38.126 --> 02:43:40.047]  People simply can't afford it.
[02:43:40.327 --> 02:43:41.528]  It's not sustainable.
[02:43:41.828 --> 02:43:43.629]  They talk about a housing crisis.
[02:43:44.069 --> 02:43:53.274]  The fact they're bringing in net 300,000 people every single year is never part of the debate, and that's the rejection you saw with Brexit.
[02:43:53.314 --> 02:43:54.715]  I want to talk about Brexit, actually.
[02:43:54.735 --> 02:43:56.156]  It's almost a year since the vote.
[02:43:56.636 --> 02:44:08.952]  We had massive doomsday proclamations that when this vote went through, if it went through for leave, which it did, we would instantly begin to see economic Armageddon, all these different companies deserting the UK.
[02:44:09.553 --> 02:44:12.397]  What's happened in the ten months since the Brexit vote?
[02:44:13.749 --> 02:44:14.930]  Well, things have been pretty good.
[02:44:14.990 --> 02:44:17.672]  I mean, tourism's up and retail sales are up.
[02:44:17.712 --> 02:44:22.095]  And of course, you won't hear any of this on the TV because the whole thing's been a disaster and a catastrophe.
[02:44:22.495 --> 02:44:27.238]  The economic reality has not bared out any of the predictions from the so-called experts.
[02:44:27.558 --> 02:44:42.088]  And one of the interesting things I like to think about, Paul, and that isn't often discussed is, if you think about the people that run Britain and run the Treasury, the people that made all these predictions, the people whose job it is to get economic forecasts correct,
[02:44:42.648 --> 02:44:46.790]  These people didn't just get it wrong, they got it catastrophically wrong.
[02:44:47.031 --> 02:44:54.115]  Some of them said that this country would be in recession and yet they've been proven to basically not know what they're talking about.
[02:44:54.515 --> 02:45:00.278]  And the interesting thing about when we talk about the swamp and Trump and draining the swamp, how many of them have lost their jobs?
[02:45:00.798 --> 02:45:10.124]  How many of these economists and these officials in the Treasury that made all these predictions about what would happen with Brexit and were proven basically to not have a clue what they were talking about?
[02:45:10.444 --> 02:45:11.185]  Have lost their jobs.
[02:45:11.425 --> 02:45:12.166]  They're all still there.
[02:45:12.506 --> 02:45:13.827]  They're all still making predictions.
[02:45:14.188 --> 02:45:20.534]  Our government's still relying on them to make the predictions about economic policy and that's the thing I find interesting now.
[02:45:20.814 --> 02:45:22.116]  I don't think that's good enough anymore.
[02:45:22.376 --> 02:45:27.181]  I think when we're looking at a Brexit revolution and democracy spreading and the move against globalism
[02:45:27.501 --> 02:45:29.042]  We need some accountability here.
[02:45:29.422 --> 02:45:39.988]  If we're relying on people to make economic forecasts, and very important economic forecasts, don't forget, you know, some of those scare stories could have swung the referendum, could have changed the course of this country's history.
[02:45:40.508 --> 02:45:44.130]  And the people that made them and got them so badly wrong are just not accountable.
[02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:56.037]  In fact, George Osborne, who was the Chancellor at the time, who just announced he's standing down as an MP, by the way, doubled the national debt as well, isn't he a great guy, who oversaw these ridiculous economic forecasts,
[02:45:56.297 --> 02:45:59.378]  It's just been made editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper in London.
[02:45:59.659 --> 02:46:03.801]  So, you know, this shows you failure in politics is sometimes rewarded.
[02:46:03.821 --> 02:46:04.841]  It is quite bizarre.
[02:46:05.641 --> 02:46:12.545]  They're rewarding people who got it absolutely 100% wrong, especially in terms of, as he said, economic forecasts in the media.
[02:46:12.845 --> 02:46:22.469]  Regarding the media, actually, I wanted to talk about a big story you covered a few weeks ago, which was you looked at the average age of people who are watching mainstream media broadcasts.
[02:46:22.930 --> 02:46:24.490]  Very interesting results.
[02:46:24.570 --> 02:46:25.371]  Tell us the figures.
[02:46:26.991 --> 02:46:29.954]  Well, basically, it shows you, I think, that the BBC was about 61%.
[02:46:30.314 --> 02:46:33.257]  You know, you're talking mid-50s.
[02:46:33.297 --> 02:46:39.484]  Even the HIP channels that are sort of targeted, I think E4 was one, it's sort of mid-40s now.
[02:46:39.984 --> 02:46:47.632]  So what it shows you is an entire generation of people that aren't tuned into this sort of scheduled programming.
[02:46:48.012 --> 02:46:48.713]  We're good to go.
[02:47:07.616 --> 02:47:08.817]  The impact is there now.
[02:47:08.877 --> 02:47:09.797]  It's plain to see.
[02:47:09.817 --> 02:47:12.298]  The audiences are dying out for a lot of the mainstream news.
[02:47:12.519 --> 02:47:15.620]  And even if people do watch it, they pick out the bits they want.
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:21.063]  They don't want to sit through one hour of political interviews to listen to the one person that they're interested in.
[02:47:21.303 --> 02:47:24.404]  They'd rather go on YouTube an hour later and pick out that interview.
[02:47:24.764 --> 02:47:30.947]  And it's making people quite proactive, in a way, in their engagement with the democratic process and what's going on in the media.
[02:47:31.187 --> 02:47:32.808]  So I find all this stuff fascinating.
[02:47:33.148 --> 02:47:34.689]  I think we're going to see more and more and more of it.
[02:47:34.989 --> 02:47:40.514]  We've seen, obviously, various other internet-based media groups start up, and I think it's fantastic.
[02:47:40.534 --> 02:47:44.137]  We're even seeing it, by the way, in sports in Britain, which is very interesting.
[02:47:44.618 --> 02:47:50.283]  Rather than just having paid pundits on TV that analyse games now, you're having fan channels, right?
[02:47:50.503 --> 02:47:56.088]  So you're having people who are fans of teams going outside grounds and interviewing other fans about the game.
[02:47:57.229 --> 02:48:00.752]  I just find that exciting, that it's expanding through the whole of our cultural fabric now.
[02:48:01.297 --> 02:48:03.960]  And it's more interesting because it's more controversial.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.022]  They've got leeway to say exactly what they want.
[02:48:06.062 --> 02:48:13.891]  They're not going to say the same cookie-cutter crap that you see on sports commentary or on news commentary, which is what the BBC is.
[02:48:14.171 --> 02:48:16.674]  The average age of their viewer is 61 years old.
[02:48:16.894 --> 02:48:20.717]  You know, CNN is 59, Fox News is even older, I think it's something like 69.
[02:48:21.658 --> 02:48:22.819]  They're literally dying out.
[02:48:23.079 --> 02:48:27.303]  They're getting decimated on YouTube, which is why they're coming down with the censorship on that.
[02:48:27.643 --> 02:48:40.334]  And it's really refreshing to see, and that's why, as you mentioned earlier, more and more younger people are being drawn to our political message, because we're on demand, we're more accessible, we're more controversial, we're not controlled by anyone.
[02:48:40.634 --> 02:48:44.097]  People don't tell us what to say, we say what we think, and that's what people want to see.
[02:48:44.517 --> 02:48:48.100]  Just in the final couple of minutes here, Michael, westmonster.com.
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:51.844]  You started this website, what, back, I think it was about five, six months ago now.
[02:48:51.884 --> 02:48:52.925]  Tell us about Westmonster.
[02:48:53.922 --> 02:48:55.523]  Yeah, we started it up in January.
[02:48:55.643 --> 02:49:05.987]  It's me and Aaron Banks, who is a major UKIP donor, and also is the chairman of the Leave.eu campaign group for Brexit, who played such a fundamental role in winning the referendum here.
[02:49:06.467 --> 02:49:13.090]  And basically, I mean, my whole push on it is that I think, you know, Mike, you've talked about politics being the new punk.
[02:49:13.350 --> 02:49:18.972]  I feel very, very strongly now that the arguments that the likes of Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage and Donald Trump make
[02:49:19.392 --> 02:49:24.214]  On borders, on culture, on putting your own country's economic interests first.
[02:49:24.714 --> 02:49:26.295]  I think these are mainstream values.
[02:49:26.675 --> 02:49:32.758]  And I really resent the way that sometimes people push these ideas as being on the fringes of society.
[02:49:33.018 --> 02:49:38.440]  And it's all a bit strange, isn't it, if you think mass migration is a bad thing and you must be a bit of a weirdo.
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:45.784]  Now that's sort of a very London-centric, quite, you know, a lot of wealthy people who think they're very clever pushing their messages through a lot of big media.
[02:49:46.124 --> 02:49:53.608]  And what we're doing is actually breaking this down and pointing out a lot of times the ridiculousness of the so-called centrist view.
[02:49:53.708 --> 02:49:56.910]  I mean, again, we mentioned Emmanuel Macron.
[02:49:57.290 --> 02:50:12.415]  What's centrist about keeping your country inside a dying EU project with a failed currency that's been a disaster in terms of the migrant crisis and jobs and economically and been a disaster in terms of national security?
[02:50:12.755 --> 02:50:14.116]  That's the new fringe.
[02:50:14.536 --> 02:50:25.740]  We're the mainstream and so we wanted to present a lot of these stories that are going on in Europe and going with Trump and Brexit and push the good news of Brexit because there's a lot of good economic news and just, you know,
[02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:29.768]  Just point out and say that we're the new mainstream.
[02:50:29.809 --> 02:50:31.312]  That's how I think a lot of people feel now.
[02:50:32.216 --> 02:50:33.457]  You're resonating with people.
[02:50:33.517 --> 02:50:34.898]  We're resonating with people.
[02:50:35.118 --> 02:50:35.758]  They're not.
[02:50:35.858 --> 02:50:37.339]  That's why they're in a blind panic.
[02:50:37.379 --> 02:50:38.440]  They are the new fringe.
[02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:49.748]  As you said, we are the emerging new front line of media and youthful, energetic truth behind presidential candidates, behind these issues that people really care about.
[02:50:49.788 --> 02:50:52.029]  Mass migration being prime amongst them.
[02:50:52.430 --> 02:50:54.511]  Michael Hever, westmonster.com.
[02:50:54.531 --> 02:50:55.612]  Thanks for joining us today.
[02:50:55.632 --> 02:50:56.832]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:50:57.113 --> 02:50:58.253]  Okay, there goes Michael Hever.
[02:50:58.273 --> 02:51:01.315]  We will be back on the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[02:51:01.355 --> 02:51:01.836]  Don't go away.
[02:51:13.338 --> 02:51:21.260]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:51:21.300 --> 02:51:23.240]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:28.881]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand
[02:51:30.326 --> 02:51:30.486]  Exactly.
[02:51:30.506 --> 02:51:33.027]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[02:51:33.067 --> 02:51:36.087]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[02:51:36.127 --> 02:51:37.027]  We've both talked to them.
[02:51:55.111 --> 02:52:01.016]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[02:52:01.356 --> 02:52:10.324]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[02:52:11.185 --> 02:52:12.306]  We refuse to screw people.
[02:52:12.646 --> 02:52:13.607]  We refuse to do that.
[02:52:13.987 --> 02:52:16.649]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[02:52:16.729 --> 02:52:18.651]  We're producing something we want to take.
[02:52:18.831 --> 02:52:19.171]  Exactly.
[02:52:19.291 --> 02:52:20.572]  We're looking for the best.
[02:52:20.632 --> 02:52:25.496]  We went out and searched for the best to private label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[02:52:25.696 --> 02:52:29.359]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[02:52:29.379 --> 02:52:35.363]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[02:52:35.643 --> 02:52:36.844]  It's everywhere.
[02:52:37.024 --> 02:52:37.705]  It's in nature.
[02:52:37.785 --> 02:52:39.746]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[02:52:40.247 --> 02:52:46.291]  Just this bottle of silica, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount than even in our product, is $35.
[02:52:47.452 --> 02:52:52.715]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[02:52:52.735 --> 02:52:53.396]  This is insane.
[02:52:53.416 --> 02:53:00.020]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, OK, I get that you guys want to do high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000?
[02:53:00.540 --> 02:53:02.562]  And then you can sell multiple bottles of it.
[02:53:02.602 --> 02:53:03.482]  People will buy more of it.
[02:53:03.502 --> 02:53:04.183]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[02:53:04.283 --> 02:53:06.064]  OK, compare that to this.
[02:53:06.284 --> 02:53:09.026]  This is a $50 product, one of the leaders in the industry.
[02:53:09.406 --> 02:53:11.227]  It has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[02:53:11.407 --> 02:53:11.748]  OK, we have 10,000.
[02:53:11.828 --> 02:53:12.768]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[02:53:15.350 --> 02:53:17.211]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[02:53:17.611 --> 02:53:22.875]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[02:53:23.475 --> 02:53:26.737]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[02:53:27.158 --> 02:53:35.883]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product, my quality of life just isn't as good.
[02:53:35.963 --> 02:53:37.044]  It's changed my life.
[02:53:37.144 --> 02:53:39.385]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[02:53:39.726 --> 02:53:41.587]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[02:53:41.987 --> 02:53:44.329]  I was jogging, lifting weights, I couldn't lose the weight.
[02:53:45.249 --> 02:53:52.296]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[02:53:52.697 --> 02:53:53.457]  It's a win-win.
[02:53:53.938 --> 02:53:54.719]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:54:25.282 --> 02:54:27.743]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:27.783 --> 02:54:31.865]  Breaking news, Israeli warplanes launch missile attack on Syrian army units.
[02:54:31.905 --> 02:54:35.267]  That whole powder keg continues to escalate in Syria.
[02:54:35.307 --> 02:54:43.071]  We're going to dip back into that news in a second, but final call for the Easter Mega Special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:54:43.111 --> 02:54:45.332]  These specials will not last for much longer.
[02:54:45.352 --> 02:54:47.533]  30% off Brain Force, 25% off Secret 12, Vitamin B12.
[02:54:50.835 --> 02:54:52.998]  25% off Super Female Vitality.
[02:54:53.438 --> 02:54:59.906]  In fact, I think Super Male Vitality is almost basically sold out at those prices, so these products are going quick.
[02:55:00.487 --> 02:55:03.090]  This is not going to stick around for long.
[02:55:03.390 --> 02:55:04.912]  25% off Survival Shield X2.
[02:55:04.952 --> 02:55:08.857]  We have all the other great products there at infowarstore.com.
[02:55:08.917 --> 02:55:09.438]  Caveman.
[02:55:10.811 --> 02:55:13.192]  The Caveman True Paleo Formula.
[02:55:13.793 --> 02:55:16.274]  The Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:55:16.334 --> 02:55:18.896]  You're gonna buy Fluoride Free Toothpaste anyway.
[02:55:19.276 --> 02:55:20.697]  Who isn't using it at this point?
[02:55:21.137 --> 02:55:23.178]  Why not buy it direct from us?
[02:55:23.198 --> 02:55:24.659]  5 star reviews.
[02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:29.842]  5 star reviews, 18 of them, for Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:55:30.262 --> 02:55:33.624]  Those Conservatism is the New Cancer Culture mugs are gonna be out soon as well.
[02:55:34.045 --> 02:55:35.045]  Excited about that.
[02:55:35.065 --> 02:55:37.387]  That's gonna trigger a lot of people in the process.
[02:55:37.967 --> 02:55:39.168]  And again, there's the toothpaste.
[02:55:39.569 --> 02:55:40.990]  Supporters, we're under attack.
[02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:42.212]  We really appreciate it.
[02:55:42.252 --> 02:55:44.314]  We couldn't survive and thrive without you.
[02:55:44.334 --> 02:55:46.196]  The extended Easter sale.
[02:55:46.697 --> 02:55:50.501]  Still running for a limited time only at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:52.628 --> 02:55:54.129]  Getting back into this news right now.
[02:55:55.130 --> 02:56:01.355]  US officials announced yesterday that they would seek the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
[02:56:01.395 --> 02:56:03.076]  That was a huge story yesterday.
[02:56:03.096 --> 02:56:04.618]  It continues to rumble on today.
[02:56:05.258 --> 02:56:13.445]  Basically, you know, WikiLeaks releases classified information it believes is in the public interest from anonymous sources.
[02:56:14.482 --> 02:56:19.467]  The New York Times and the Washington Post does exactly the same thing.
[02:56:19.507 --> 02:56:22.570]  So why aren't their journalists being arrested too?
[02:56:22.970 --> 02:56:24.932]  Why aren't they being brought up on charges?
[02:56:24.972 --> 02:56:25.693]  Well, we know why.
[02:56:26.053 --> 02:56:29.236]  Because they're working directly with the Deep State.
[02:56:29.757 --> 02:56:34.762]  Whereas Julian Assange and Wikileaks is working to expose the crimes of the Deep State.
[02:56:35.102 --> 02:56:38.805]  That's why he's under threat of arrest and they're not.
[02:56:39.426 --> 02:56:44.669]  Now, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has come out and pushed for Assange's arrest.
[02:56:45.229 --> 02:56:55.994]  Of course, he should be focusing on what he was brought into the Trump administration to do, which is arresting and deporting illegal aliens, narco-terrorists and drug dealers.
[02:56:56.515 --> 02:57:00.917]  Now he's moving over to focus on arresting Julian Assange again.
[02:57:01.517 --> 02:57:04.821]  Splitting with the Trump base, a lot of people are concerned about that.
[02:57:05.141 --> 02:57:11.228]  Let's be honest, a lot of people have said that could be their final straw if Julian Assange is arrested.
[02:57:11.949 --> 02:57:15.593]  Again, especially given the fact, remember Trump said, quote, I love WikiLeaks.
[02:57:16.773 --> 02:57:18.393]  I love WikiLeaks, that's what he said.
[02:57:18.433 --> 02:57:21.034]  Now Julian Assange is under threat of arrest.
[02:57:21.594 --> 02:57:31.756]  Now Congressman Peter King, and we have this clip, we can queue it up, said yesterday on CNN that Trump is seeing Assange and WikiLeaks from a, quote, different perspective.
[02:57:31.776 --> 02:57:32.436]  Here's the clip.
[02:57:33.276 --> 02:57:43.177]  The president is seeing this now from a different perspective and realizing that, yeah, while maybe one day Assange can help you, overall, this is damaging to the national interest of the United States.
[02:57:43.678 --> 02:57:46.158]  And again, he's put American lives at risk over the years.
[02:57:47.216 --> 02:57:49.917]  So there you have Peter King celebrating this decision.
[02:57:49.977 --> 02:57:55.640]  How concerned should we be that people like Peter King are celebrating the Trump administration's decisions?
[02:57:55.980 --> 02:58:02.663]  How concerned should we be that Lindsey Graham is up on Fox News saying he's quote the happiest dude ever?
[02:58:03.283 --> 02:58:06.925]  Given what's happening with Syria, NATO and a bunch of other issues.
[02:58:07.366 --> 02:58:12.109]  Now let's be clear, we're absolutely delighted that Hillary Clinton is not in the White House.
[02:58:12.569 --> 02:58:23.716]  But let's also be clear in saying the elephant in the room is that many in Trump's base are extremely concerned about these 180 reversals that have happened over the past month.
[02:58:24.017 --> 02:58:27.339]  The potential arrest of Julian Assange being one of them.
[02:58:27.879 --> 02:58:29.220]  Huge concern amongst the base.
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:31.661]  Many people have said that that is their red line.
[02:58:31.702 --> 02:58:32.742]  That's the final straw.
[02:58:32.782 --> 02:58:33.823]  They will abandon Trump.
[02:58:34.283 --> 02:58:35.104]  He's impressionable.
[02:58:35.284 --> 02:58:36.164]  We need to talk to him.
[02:58:36.585 --> 02:58:37.565]  And we'll continue to do so.
[02:58:37.605 --> 02:58:38.846]  We'll be back with the next segment.
[02:58:38.906 --> 02:58:39.807]  Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:58:40.047 --> 02:58:40.707]  Don't go away.
[02:58:40.727 --> 02:58:46.611]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.631 --> 02:58:48.652]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[02:59:02.448 --> 02:59:10.577]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:10.837 --> 02:59:15.543]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:15.723 --> 02:59:22.411]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:22.531 --> 02:59:29.599]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:29.679 --> 02:59:36.564]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:36.704 --> 02:59:41.067]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:41.187 --> 02:59:50.714]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:50.894 --> 02:59:52.555]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:54.457 --> 02:59:58.559]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.079 --> 03:00:00.419]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.762 --> 03:00:14.424]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[03:00:14.624 --> 03:00:17.005]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast.
[03:00:17.706 --> 03:00:21.107]  But we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[03:00:23.387 --> 03:00:26.084]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:31.957 --> 03:00:34.098]  David Knight is coming up with the fourth hour.
[03:00:34.118 --> 03:00:37.218]  I'm going to break down some final news stories here for the moment, though.
[03:00:37.258 --> 03:00:47.461]  As I mentioned before the break, we have Attorney General Jeff Sessions indicating that he will support and push for the arrest of Julian Assange, saying it's a priority.
[03:00:47.481 --> 03:00:56.703]  I think arresting actual drug lords and narco-terrorists should be a priority, rather than somebody who leaks information that's in the public interest.
[03:00:57.343 --> 03:00:59.804]  Unlike the New York Times and the Washington Post, who leak
[03:01:00.544 --> 03:01:09.490]  Information that's not even in the public interest which only serves to delegitimize and destabilize a presidency and a country in their own partisan interests.
[03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:12.132]  They can leak that, they don't face arrest.
[03:01:12.392 --> 03:01:19.557]  Julian Assange faces arrest and now elements of the Trump administration are pushing full weight for that to happen.
[03:01:20.297 --> 03:01:22.019]  He's also making it a priority to
[03:01:23.311 --> 03:01:26.093]  Basically continue the war on drugs in terms of marijuana.
[03:01:26.134 --> 03:01:31.738]  We had a Hill poll a few days ago which found that 61% of Americans want marijuana to be legalized.
[03:01:32.119 --> 03:01:34.181]  A 5% increase in a year.
[03:01:34.461 --> 03:01:38.865]  That's the highest ever support for the legalization of marijuana.
[03:01:39.365 --> 03:01:41.087]  You know, Roger Stone's been on here.
[03:01:41.107 --> 03:01:46.752]  He's tweeted that he thinks Attorney General Jeff Sessions has continued push to keep that criminal.
[03:01:47.788 --> 03:01:48.649]  Is Draconian.
[03:01:49.049 --> 03:01:49.769]  I agree with him.
[03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:53.072]  Why is he continuing the war on pot smokers?
[03:01:53.552 --> 03:01:55.673]  Why is he moving to target Julian Assange?
[03:01:56.074 --> 03:02:02.138]  Why not target the actual narco-terrorists, the hard drug dealers that are destabilizing the country?
[03:02:02.478 --> 03:02:06.421]  Target the drug lords, deport the criminal, illegal aliens.
[03:02:06.961 --> 03:02:08.142]  Why have they now shifted?
[03:02:08.202 --> 03:02:10.964]  Why are they now saying the priority is Julian Assange?
[03:02:11.004 --> 03:02:12.185]  That's not the priority.
[03:02:13.168 --> 03:02:15.272]  Donald Trump said, quote, I love WikiLeaks.
[03:02:15.372 --> 03:02:17.495]  Why has this change happened?
[03:02:17.756 --> 03:02:18.858]  We're not sycophants.
[03:02:18.918 --> 03:02:25.288]  We're free to criticize the Trump administration when it does things we don't like, when it breaks its promises.
[03:02:25.749 --> 03:02:26.570]  And we're going to do that.
[03:02:27.455 --> 03:02:29.476]  Doesn't mean we're abandoning Trump.
[03:02:29.897 --> 03:02:32.418]  It means we're still delighted there's no Hillary Clinton.
[03:02:32.438 --> 03:02:33.679]  But again, we're not sheep.
[03:02:34.079 --> 03:02:35.020]  We're not sycophants.
[03:02:35.320 --> 03:02:39.963]  We're going to hold their feet to the fire because they represent you, the American people.
[03:02:40.784 --> 03:02:41.804]  You don't have to worship them.
[03:02:41.824 --> 03:02:45.347]  You don't have to bow down and accept everything they say without question.
[03:02:45.447 --> 03:02:47.088]  People have got serious concerns.
[03:02:47.608 --> 03:02:55.673]  This is the elephant in the living room with Trump's base and we're going to call them out on it every opportunity we get in a functioning democracy.
[03:02:55.733 --> 03:02:56.554]  That's the whole point.
[03:02:57.432 --> 03:02:59.868]  Well that's it, a final news story here which is about you two.
[03:03:01.704 --> 03:03:05.346]  BBC News reports YouTube to offer fake news workshops to teenagers.
[03:03:06.007 --> 03:03:12.190]  YouTube is launching a new campaign to tackle internet safety and issues around fake news the video streaming site has announced.
[03:03:12.871 --> 03:03:29.121]  They're going to launch a workshop aimed at 13 to 18 year olds to help them spot fake news and to provide a guide as to what constitutes topics like hate and extremism while encouraging them to spread positive messages.
[03:03:29.901 --> 03:03:44.006]  Now if you actually look into what this is about, which I did, the people listed on this Creators for Change list of channels that they will promote on YouTube, it's basically the Linda Sarsour Islamist feminist angle.
[03:03:44.346 --> 03:03:48.608]  This is a woman who has advocated Sharia law, who is linked to Hamas.
[03:03:49.008 --> 03:03:51.549]  Who has spouted Islamist propaganda.
[03:03:51.970 --> 03:03:58.233]  Who has called for Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Muslim reformist, to have her genitals removed.
[03:03:58.553 --> 03:04:00.974]  Supported FGM and Sharia law.
[03:04:01.334 --> 03:04:06.097]  She's the person being pushed by YouTube to tackle hate and extremism.
[03:04:06.417 --> 03:04:08.358]  You can look at the other channels that they're pushing.
[03:04:08.638 --> 03:04:09.639]  Black Lives Matter.
[03:04:10.299 --> 03:04:12.160]  Masculinity so fragile.
[03:04:12.521 --> 03:04:14.102]  My hijab story.
[03:04:14.502 --> 03:04:21.346]  Again, it's all social justice warrior regressive leftist crap, which doesn't resonate with anyone.
[03:04:21.726 --> 03:04:24.208]  You can go on their channels, you can see the video views.
[03:04:24.628 --> 03:04:25.449]  It's pathetic.
[03:04:25.789 --> 03:04:27.510]  It's 1,000, 2,000 views.
[03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:29.131]  We're decimating them.
[03:04:29.411 --> 03:04:30.552]  They're nervous about it.
[03:04:30.792 --> 03:04:38.177]  That's why they're targeting us for censorship and demonetization while pushing these social justice warrior channels.
[03:04:38.477 --> 03:04:38.978]  Because again,
[03:04:39.818 --> 03:04:48.828]  They don't resonate with anyone, so they're having to rig the game to silence truly independent voices that people really want to hear.
[03:04:49.569 --> 03:04:51.911]  That's going to wrap it up for my part on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:51.931 --> 03:04:53.012]  David Knight coming up.
[03:04:53.433 --> 03:04:55.956]  Fourth hour, fresh, breaking news.
[03:04:56.156 --> 03:04:59.179]  It's the Alex Jones Show, live in 4Wars.com.
[03:04:59.199 --> 03:04:59.740]  Don't go away.
[03:05:02.796 --> 03:05:04.578]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman.
[03:05:04.598 --> 03:05:06.640]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[03:05:06.700 --> 03:05:10.104]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, I don't know about this one.
[03:05:10.565 --> 03:05:13.548]  You know, and and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[03:05:13.588 --> 03:05:14.169]  I'm 42.
[03:05:14.209 --> 03:05:17.092]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[03:05:17.272 --> 03:05:18.734]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[03:05:20.235 --> 03:05:21.796]  No, I'm not.
[03:05:21.836 --> 03:05:22.476]  I'm terrible.
[03:05:22.516 --> 03:05:23.076]  I'm terrible.
[03:05:23.176 --> 03:05:30.319]  But, the point is, is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[03:05:30.919 --> 03:05:38.122]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula, has just worked magic for me.
[03:05:38.162 --> 03:05:41.643]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[03:05:43.044 --> 03:05:48.288]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[03:05:48.328 --> 03:05:51.411]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[03:05:51.811 --> 03:05:53.092]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[03:05:53.492 --> 03:05:54.673]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[03:05:54.753 --> 03:05:55.894]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[03:05:55.914 --> 03:06:03.080]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[03:06:03.500 --> 03:06:05.601]  Yeah.
[03:06:05.641 --> 03:06:11.305]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[03:06:11.345 --> 03:06:13.046]  I felt it immediately.
[03:06:13.266 --> 03:06:15.287]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[03:06:15.367 --> 03:06:18.449]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[03:06:18.509 --> 03:06:19.589]  It tastes good to me.
[03:06:19.609 --> 03:06:23.651]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[03:06:23.691 --> 03:06:25.733]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[03:06:29.575 --> 03:06:34.719]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[03:06:35.199 --> 03:06:38.481]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[03:06:38.521 --> 03:06:46.287]  So ladies, get yourself some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[03:06:46.327 --> 03:06:49.549]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my feet.
[03:06:49.569 --> 03:06:51.491]  Maybe get it for your wife then too, or girlfriend.
[03:06:52.231 --> 03:06:58.219]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[03:06:58.239 --> 03:06:59.821]  No fear, nothing, so.
[03:07:00.506 --> 03:07:07.828]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[03:07:08.388 --> 03:07:10.209]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[03:07:10.929 --> 03:07:21.472]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[03:07:21.512 --> 03:07:22.772]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[03:07:22.812 --> 03:07:28.914]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[03:07:30.174 --> 03:07:32.415]  A borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[03:07:32.475 --> 03:07:34.657]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[03:07:34.697 --> 03:07:42.762]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[03:07:42.802 --> 03:07:46.124]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[03:07:46.164 --> 03:07:49.005]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[03:07:49.105 --> 03:07:54.509]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us and
[03:07:55.189 --> 03:08:02.074]  Even when we make mistakes, and even when we're not right, and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us, and I appreciate that.
[03:08:08.639 --> 03:08:09.540]  You found it.
[03:08:09.880 --> 03:08:11.401]  The tip of the spear.
[03:08:11.881 --> 03:08:14.343]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:16.084 --> 03:08:18.886]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[03:08:23.829 --> 03:08:25.210]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:25.230 --> 03:08:25.830]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:25.870 --> 03:08:32.355]  On this Friday, April 21st, sandwiched between 420 and Earth Day, I guess
[03:08:33.539 --> 03:08:42.528]  They did Earth Day two days after 420, so people have enough time to prepare themselves mentally for the fallacies of Earth Day, but we'll have that tomorrow.
[03:08:42.548 --> 03:08:45.972]  But today we have a blackout in San Francisco.
[03:08:45.992 --> 03:08:54.220]  Top of Drudge Report is showing that they've had about, estimates right now, about 95,000 people according to KGO and NBC.
[03:08:55.621 --> 03:09:00.304]  And of course, these are 88 outages that have spread across the area.
[03:09:00.324 --> 03:09:06.828]  They shut down businesses, the BART station, which is their public transportation.
[03:09:07.368 --> 03:09:09.710]  They have their cable cars, traffic lights, so forth.
[03:09:10.270 --> 03:09:16.594]  This is a good example, folks, that highlights the vulnerabilities of complicated infrastructure.
[03:09:17.529 --> 03:09:28.189]  At the same time that we're moving to complicate our infrastructure even farther so that we can monitor and track and tax everything that everyone does.
[03:09:29.215 --> 03:09:40.083]  I think it's interesting to note over the last week, I've seen a number of articles, of course, it's almost like if you look at the car press anymore, I'm somebody who likes cars, if you look at the car press anymore, all you see are two things.
[03:09:40.703 --> 03:09:56.314]  You see articles about hypercars and supercars that cost a couple million dollars that none of us will ever see, and that we're not going to see the technology filter down because the other part of the articles that are out there about self-driving cars, I don't really care how they're powered, I don't care if it's
[03:09:57.594 --> 03:10:02.878]  Fuel cells, or hydrogen, or electricity, or gasoline, or diesel.
[03:10:02.918 --> 03:10:06.041]  I don't really care as long as humans are in control of it.
[03:10:06.061 --> 03:10:16.150]  And by humans, I don't mean one or two people that are part of a massive corporation that's working hand-in-glove with the government, or if it's the government itself that is going to be controlling all this.
[03:10:16.210 --> 03:10:17.391]  Those are the things that concern me.
[03:10:18.131 --> 03:10:24.617]  And if you look at what's happening in the future, when you look at what's going on with Agenda 21, I think it's a good time we look at these types of
[03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:30.021]  Power outages that hit, again, the heart of the tech companies.
[03:10:30.461 --> 03:10:43.084]  They're the same people who are bringing about the Internet of Things, and they want your car to join the Internet of Things that they will own, that they will control, because they're going to drive you out of your car.
[03:10:43.104 --> 03:10:50.046]  They're going to make it too expensive, or they're going to make it too short-lived for it to make sense for you to own it.
[03:10:50.326 --> 03:10:55.047]  You know, they could mandate, for example, right today, they could mandate everybody go to electric
[03:10:56.094 --> 03:11:04.838]  And make it so expensive with all the safety devices that you can't possibly afford to keep it for the short amount of time that's going to last before the batteries die.
[03:11:04.858 --> 03:11:10.661]  I mean, there's a lot of different ways that they can come up with planned obsolescence, but the key is that they want to make sure that you don't own the car.
[03:11:11.877 --> 03:11:13.238]  A few of them will own everything.
[03:11:13.278 --> 03:11:14.999]  They will own the roads, they'll own the toll roads.
[03:11:15.519 --> 03:11:21.463]  This is one of the things that we have to be concerned about and watch out for when we look at the infrastructure bill that Donald Trump is talking about.
[03:11:21.503 --> 03:11:23.204]  Yes, we do need our infrastructure fixed.
[03:11:23.964 --> 03:11:29.447]  As I pointed out yesterday when a reporter from The Nation went to South Korea to report on the situation there.
[03:11:30.928 --> 03:11:35.532]  He began his story by talking about how wonderful their airport was and the infrastructure that they had there.
[03:11:35.552 --> 03:11:37.213]  But of course, ours is not.
[03:11:37.353 --> 03:11:38.374]  Ours is crumbling.
[03:11:38.394 --> 03:11:44.659]  The only thing that we invest in is surveillance technology and security guards and screening devices.
[03:11:45.472 --> 03:11:47.875]  We don't invest in anything that actually serves us.
[03:11:48.035 --> 03:11:49.737]  It only serves the control state.
[03:11:49.757 --> 03:11:52.320]  And that's what we're going to be investing in if we're not careful.
[03:11:52.621 --> 03:12:01.031]  This infrastructure bill will be used to create smart information highways and smart cities if we're not careful about what we're going to do.
[03:12:01.932 --> 03:12:04.495]  And we'll wind up funding it because we don't want to raise taxes.
[03:12:04.515 --> 03:12:09.700]  We want to have a nice infrastructure bill without anybody seeing the cost immediately.
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:16.947]  So we'll go to foreign corporations and multinational corporations to finance toll roads that they will then own.
[03:12:17.948 --> 03:12:20.210]  Your cars will not be affordable for you to own.
[03:12:21.325 --> 03:12:22.666]  They'll not be drivable by you.
[03:12:22.726 --> 03:12:27.631]  It'll be the toll roads and the foreign corporations that will be controlling your transportation and tracking you everywhere.
[03:12:28.071 --> 03:12:32.595]  And of course, the people who want to get in on this are the automobile manufacturers themselves.
[03:12:32.736 --> 03:12:38.361]  They realized that it was far more profitable for them to lease cars to you than it was to sell cars to you.
[03:12:39.894 --> 03:12:42.576]  That's a great way to set up planned obsolescence.
[03:12:42.596 --> 03:12:50.239]  But they know that it is even more profitable to go from leasing a car to leasing the rides.
[03:12:50.980 --> 03:12:56.923]  And that's why Ford and GM and the rest of these people are pushing so hard, working in conjunction with Uber.
[03:12:58.007 --> 03:13:03.635]  With Lyft, with other companies, and in many cases, setting up the infrastructure to do it themselves.
[03:13:03.895 --> 03:13:10.924]  One of the things I think indicates this, you know, we're talking about this massive shutdown where everything just shuts down in San Francisco because they've lost their power.
[03:13:12.123 --> 03:13:16.306]  And think about what's going to happen on the roads when you have a blackout.
[03:13:16.366 --> 03:13:17.347]  Everybody's just going to freeze.
[03:13:17.367 --> 03:13:18.547]  You're not going to be able to get anywhere.
[03:13:18.567 --> 03:13:20.649]  You're not going to have control of anything.
[03:13:20.669 --> 03:13:21.890]  It's all going to be connected.
[03:13:22.070 --> 03:13:23.211]  It'll all be connected to them.
[03:13:23.251 --> 03:13:33.818]  And of course, they can shut you down if you've got outstanding fines or outstanding income tax or they've got a beef with your political views, so forth and so on.
[03:13:33.838 --> 03:13:34.678]  We'll see that happening.
[03:13:34.718 --> 03:13:39.001]  Everything that they're doing right now on the internet to free speech, they'll do to you physically.
[03:13:39.381 --> 03:13:40.042]  That's going to be coming.
[03:13:40.442 --> 03:13:44.367]  Let's take a look at this article here that's from Car and Driver, for example.
[03:13:44.407 --> 03:13:50.894]  As I said, most of the articles now, they're like half these hypercars and half of it about the new coming technology.
[03:13:51.455 --> 03:13:59.404]  And I thought it was kind of interesting because they said, despite concerns, Cadillac is now going to press forward with what they call their Super Cruise semi-autonomous technology.
[03:14:00.245 --> 03:14:04.086]  General Motors intends to launch a semi-autonomous feature called Super Cruise.
[03:14:04.106 --> 03:14:11.708]  They're going to do it later this year, despite the fact that federal safety regulators have expressed concern about a key aspect of the system's design.
[03:14:11.748 --> 03:14:18.529]  Under certain highway conditions, according to the company, the Super Cruise system can follow lanes, it can brake, it can control speed.
[03:14:19.089 --> 03:14:20.810]  Notice that caveat there, under certain.
[03:14:21.638 --> 03:14:22.419]  Highway conditions.
[03:14:22.519 --> 03:14:24.802]  Under ideal conditions, it can do that.
[03:14:25.964 --> 03:14:30.831]  They're going to bring it out in the fall with their 2018 Cadillac CT6 sedan.
[03:14:31.271 --> 03:14:36.819]  They say it is, quote, true hands-free driving technology for the highway, but it still requires you to pay close attention.
[03:14:37.538 --> 03:14:43.242]  And so, to get you to pay attention, the nanny technology is going to monitor your head position.
[03:14:44.063 --> 03:14:56.993]  If it decides that you are not paying attention, that your head is not in the proper position or somehow, whatever, it's going to monitor your eyes, I don't know how it's going to determine whether the nanny car is going to determine whether you're paying attention or not.
[03:14:57.693 --> 03:15:05.360]  You're going to receive an escalating series of cues and warnings and naggings that will urge you to pay attention.
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:09.883]  And if you don't do all of that, then it's going to come to a stop.
[03:15:10.284 --> 03:15:11.685]  But it isn't going to pull over to the side of the road.
[03:15:11.785 --> 03:15:12.926]  It'll just stop wherever it is.
[03:15:13.206 --> 03:15:14.207]  Like right in the middle of the road.
[03:15:14.387 --> 03:15:15.648]  Like right in the middle of the interstate.
[03:15:16.148 --> 03:15:18.150]  And so you see the obvious problem with this, right?
[03:15:19.031 --> 03:15:24.555]  That if this car is going along and it decides that it's going to stop, it might do it pretty quickly.
[03:15:24.835 --> 03:15:26.217]  Or, even if you catch it,
[03:15:27.091 --> 03:15:29.873]  And you slow down, maybe the guy behind you isn't going to.
[03:15:29.913 --> 03:15:35.637]  Look, when you stop a car, especially on the interstate, which is most likely where you're going to use Super Cruise, right?
[03:15:36.077 --> 03:15:41.720]  It's not going to be when you're going through the town and you've got a lot of traffic lights, but on the interstate, it's just going to shut down.
[03:15:42.521 --> 03:15:48.585]  You do that, and at some point, as the cars start to back up, somebody is going to get rear-ended.
[03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:50.751]  Somebody's going to get hurt.
[03:15:51.431 --> 03:15:58.975]  But we don't worry about that because this is the kind of what we used to call feature creep when we were designing systems.
[03:15:59.035 --> 03:16:02.217]  We would say you're going to keep adding bells and whistles to the system.
[03:16:02.737 --> 03:16:04.098]  You're going to have this feature creep.
[03:16:04.118 --> 03:16:12.983]  Well, these are creepy features and it's just technology for bragging rights and to experiment on the road against you.
[03:16:13.063 --> 03:16:18.486]  Now, the National Highway Traffic Safety Association, that I sometimes refer to as NHTSA,
[03:16:19.552 --> 03:16:21.733]  They had a lawyer in November 2016.
[03:16:21.933 --> 03:16:24.074]  His name was Paul Hemmersbog.
[03:16:24.935 --> 03:16:26.756]  And he wrote, he was their chief lawyer.
[03:16:27.256 --> 03:16:34.880]  He wrote, quote, we note that GM indicates that when the driver is unable or unwilling to take control of the vehicle, the system will bring the vehicle to a stop in or near the roadway.
[03:16:35.280 --> 03:16:44.205]  We urge GM to fully consider the likely operation of the system it is contemplating and ensure this fallback solution does not present an unreasonable risk to safety.
[03:16:44.884 --> 03:16:49.127]  And they might get recalls if they put this out and don't follow those rules, right?
[03:16:49.167 --> 03:16:49.887]  Well, what happened?
[03:16:50.508 --> 03:16:54.410]  Well, we find out that after he wrote that letter, General Motors hired him!
[03:16:55.973 --> 03:16:57.574]  See, that's the way that it works.
[03:16:57.614 --> 03:17:06.159]  Whether you're a big pharma, or you're the big auto companies, or whoever, you can get rid of these little nagging regulatory issues by hiring the right people.
[03:17:06.820 --> 03:17:07.460]  Hiring them away.
[03:17:07.500 --> 03:17:09.501]  If they give you a problem, you just buy them off.
[03:17:09.802 --> 03:17:10.102]  Okay?
[03:17:10.582 --> 03:17:13.244]  I don't know if that's what happened with this guy, but it certainly looks suspicious.
[03:17:13.504 --> 03:17:17.446]  We have seen that happen many, many times in many different ways.
[03:17:17.566 --> 03:17:21.329]  But the fact remains that you're going to have the government
[03:17:21.969 --> 03:17:28.920]  Bend over backwards to open up the roads to this technology that is not tested, and they're going to test it on the roads.
[03:17:28.981 --> 03:17:29.962]  And where is this all headed?
[03:17:30.002 --> 03:17:32.326]  Well, we had just a few days ago...
[03:17:33.419 --> 03:17:37.382]  An article, a very long article from the Wall Street Journal called The Rise of the Smart City.
[03:17:37.462 --> 03:17:39.523]  See, this is all about Agenda 21.
[03:17:40.264 --> 03:17:44.527]  This is about confining you to the cities and controlling you within the cities.
[03:17:44.947 --> 03:17:46.008]  Very tightly controlling you.
[03:17:46.228 --> 03:17:56.075]  Making sure that you're not going to be getting out of the cities and going into the rural areas where you now can travel without their permission.
[03:17:56.555 --> 03:17:58.657]  You won't be able to do that with their little electric cars.
[03:17:58.677 --> 03:17:59.597]  They're in limited range.
[03:18:00.158 --> 03:18:01.379]  And their smart highways.
[03:18:02.256 --> 03:18:06.625]  And so this is all in praise of the smart city at Wall Street Journal.
[03:18:06.645 --> 03:18:11.234]  And of course, a lot of organizations have been set up, grants have been set up for smart cities.
[03:18:11.274 --> 03:18:12.135]  This is nothing new.
[03:18:12.656 --> 03:18:13.819]  It's just yet another
[03:18:14.964 --> 03:18:20.325]  article that is praising this Agenda 21 approach of concentrating people in the cities and then controlling them.
[03:18:20.465 --> 03:18:21.726]  So they talk about the Internet of Things.
[03:18:21.766 --> 03:18:29.608]  They talk about how they can use inexpensive sensors to track a vast array of information, things like gunshots or traffic or air pollution.
[03:18:30.308 --> 03:18:36.449]  And then, of course, there's the widespread use of smartphones and mobile devices that will let them monitor you.
[03:18:36.509 --> 03:18:42.911]  And then they get to the bottom of all this and they say, well, you know, all this data collection really kind of raises understandable privacy concerns.
[03:18:43.874 --> 03:18:45.275]  And then they immediately push back.
[03:18:45.495 --> 03:18:46.516]  But cities understand that.
[03:18:46.576 --> 03:18:48.417]  And they're going to make sure that really doesn't happen.
[03:18:48.438 --> 03:18:49.478]  So you don't have to worry about that.
[03:18:49.518 --> 03:18:52.861]  And then they focus only on the upsides of this technology.
[03:18:53.661 --> 03:18:55.903]  Never talking about the downsides of this.
[03:18:55.923 --> 03:18:57.544]  That's why we cover this.
[03:18:57.845 --> 03:19:00.146]  Because you have to understand where this is headed.
[03:19:00.246 --> 03:19:05.951]  This is headed to a situation that is going to tax and track everything that you do.
[03:19:07.074 --> 03:19:10.059]  And of course, they're going to profit immensely from this.
[03:19:10.219 --> 03:19:17.571]  These corporations that not only will make more money by leasing you the cars, but they're also going to make money by selling information about you.
[03:19:18.496 --> 03:19:20.919]  They're not just going to give it to the government when the government demands it.
[03:19:21.499 --> 03:19:23.501]  They're also going to sell all this information.
[03:19:23.542 --> 03:19:29.168]  So there's another story on Car and Driver about how automakers will soon have new ways to profit from driver data.
[03:19:29.188 --> 03:19:34.894]  They said there's so much data that is streaming already from modern cars that automakers have trouble making sense of it all.
[03:19:35.434 --> 03:19:40.300]  And they said that now subcontractors like Delphi Automatic are going out there
[03:19:41.080 --> 03:19:41.561]  Doug Hagman.
[03:20:07.771 --> 03:20:16.737]  The Northeast Intelligence Network and of course he's a law enforcement training group and also a well-known respected private detective who becomes highly recommended over the years from our sources.
[03:20:17.178 --> 03:20:23.602]  He has FBI sources also, state police sources and others in multiple states there on the East Coast.
[03:20:23.782 --> 03:20:25.123]  So Doug Hagman, thank you for joining us.
[03:20:25.203 --> 03:20:28.846]  You look at the battlefront worldwide, the globalist forces, we're in a war right now.
[03:20:29.546 --> 03:20:31.167]  Exactly, and that's part of it.
[03:20:31.507 --> 03:20:57.422]  And when I look at my side of things, on the domestic side, what I'm hearing from my FBI sources, one confirmation I got from both an FBI source as well as an agency source or CIA source, saying watch the role of the National Geospatial Agency, the NGA, as well as the NSA in the upcoming days with respect to the leaks that had come out about the Trump administration, but also
[03:20:57.902 --> 03:20:59.504]  We're about to have nuclear war, folks.
[03:20:59.564 --> 03:21:01.085]  It's time to arrest Hillary Clinton.
[03:21:24.125 --> 03:21:25.306]  We've got to save the country.
[03:21:25.346 --> 03:21:27.067]  The world's never been in more danger.
[03:21:27.688 --> 03:21:29.149]  They're the ones that made everything radical.
[03:21:29.369 --> 03:21:33.592]  Kim Jong-un, Hillary, all these other scumbags, Juncker, all of them need to be arrested.
[03:21:33.852 --> 03:21:34.913]  They're all calling for war.
[03:21:35.093 --> 03:21:36.534]  They're all involved in criminal activity.
[03:21:36.654 --> 03:21:37.375]  Arrest all of them.
[03:21:37.595 --> 03:21:38.095]  I'm serious.
[03:21:38.756 --> 03:21:44.200]  Yeah, 100% behind you because they brought us to this point and they have sold us out.
[03:21:44.860 --> 03:21:47.162]  Uh, the Korean, uh, situation.
[03:21:47.262 --> 03:21:59.774]  So, so we've got this, this, this melting pot of, or this, uh, this, uh, really sewage pot of, of strife worldwide that was brought, we, we got to this point because of Obama and right now.
[03:22:00.975 --> 03:22:02.076]  And Clinton, especially.
[03:22:02.096 --> 03:22:13.004]  And by the way, Hillary Clinton played a significant role under Madeleine Albright during the Clinton presidency as the shadow Secretary of State to bring us to this point as well.
[03:22:13.344 --> 03:22:15.746]  And then moving on as Secretary of State under Obama.
[03:22:15.766 --> 03:22:19.088]  So this has her fingerprints all over the place.
[03:22:19.569 --> 03:22:21.810]  And here we are, you know, at this level.
[03:22:21.850 --> 03:22:28.395]  So there's much more to get into, but watch the next really 72 to 96 hours with respect to the taps.
[03:22:28.715 --> 03:22:32.866]  Why would they want to not have Russia on our side during this China crisis?
[03:22:33.428 --> 03:22:35.032]  Why are they trying to bring Russia down?
[03:22:36.175 --> 03:22:37.376]  Well, chaos.
[03:22:37.456 --> 03:22:40.439]  Operation Chaos, basically.
[03:22:40.479 --> 03:22:46.303]  The same playbook that we used, or that the Globals used back in the 60s, is being used today.
[03:22:46.444 --> 03:22:48.465]  And it's everybody against everybody.
[03:22:48.585 --> 03:22:50.527]  Let's destroy, let's burn the whole damn thing down.
[03:22:51.067 --> 03:22:54.991]  And, you know, start it from scratch.
[03:22:55.831 --> 03:22:58.994]  It's very imprudent to do that, obviously.
[03:22:59.274 --> 03:23:02.077]  But these people that we're dealing with, as you pointed out, they're psychos.
[03:23:13.112 --> 03:23:21.038]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[03:23:21.098 --> 03:23:24.201]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[03:23:25.014 --> 03:23:26.875]  And they're also very affordable.
[03:23:49.002 --> 03:23:55.733]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[03:23:56.134 --> 03:23:56.895]  It's a win-win.
[03:23:57.376 --> 03:23:58.137]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:24:21.019 --> 03:24:22.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:22.380 --> 03:24:23.000]  I'm David Knight.
[03:24:23.020 --> 03:24:29.804]  I'm going to get back to one more automobile article, I think, that shows us where this is all headed.
[03:24:29.864 --> 03:24:33.346]  But we also have extended our Easter Mega Special.
[03:24:33.406 --> 03:24:41.710]  I just want to let you know that it's still at InfoWarsTore.com, and that's 25% to 30% off a wide variety of supplements that we have there.
[03:24:41.770 --> 03:24:45.292]  For example, Super Female and Super Male Vitality, 25% off.
[03:24:45.812 --> 03:24:48.153]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, 25% off.
[03:24:49.794 --> 03:24:51.134]  25% off Secret 12.
[03:24:51.174 --> 03:24:53.275]  That's our vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:24:53.515 --> 03:24:55.515]  And 30% off Brain Force.
[03:24:56.255 --> 03:24:58.336]  So if you haven't looked at those specials, take a look at them.
[03:24:58.376 --> 03:24:59.116]  We've extended them.
[03:24:59.156 --> 03:25:04.277]  I'm not sure how much longer that's going to go, but it could be ending any day now.
[03:25:04.817 --> 03:25:11.199]  And it is very important for us to stand with you, and we really do appreciate you standing with us.
[03:25:11.219 --> 03:25:12.919]  That's why we've extended this special.
[03:25:13.559 --> 03:25:15.339]  That's the way we fund this operation, folks.
[03:25:15.780 --> 03:25:17.800]  If you listen to this, you know that we don't get any
[03:25:18.853 --> 03:25:20.655]  Funding from George Soros.
[03:25:20.675 --> 03:25:24.338]  As a matter of fact, they fund people to oppose us, to attack us.
[03:25:24.939 --> 03:25:26.741]  We don't get any funding from the government.
[03:25:27.321 --> 03:25:33.867]  We don't take big pharma commercials and we try to offer you things that aren't going to harm you.
[03:25:33.987 --> 03:25:37.871]  Safe, effective, natural ingredients, supplements that you can use for your family.
[03:25:37.891 --> 03:25:43.536]  You can read those reviews, take a look at the ingredients that are there, make your decision as far as the reviews.
[03:25:43.596 --> 03:25:44.437]  Each one of these products
[03:25:45.037 --> 03:25:45.237]  Yes.
[03:26:06.621 --> 03:26:10.525]  The government buy the car companies to take over our transportation.
[03:26:10.625 --> 03:26:11.526]  And you know, it's kind of funny.
[03:26:12.447 --> 03:26:25.420]  General Motors, who's going to be putting out a car system that if it doesn't think that you're paying enough attention, it will punish you by just slamming on the brakes there, wherever it happens to be on the interstate, and everybody else can just try to react to that.
[03:26:26.461 --> 03:26:29.884]  Now they have, in Venezuela, slammed the brakes on GM.
[03:26:31.025 --> 03:26:33.869]  They've confiscated GM's automotive factory.
[03:26:33.909 --> 03:26:36.393]  And we have this story on Infowars.com.
[03:26:36.413 --> 03:26:41.580]  Before seizing General Motors, Venezuela tried to make a car partnering with Iran.
[03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:42.821]  This was like seven years ago.
[03:26:42.862 --> 03:26:46.847]  And they came up, you'll see that picture on the article, the car was the Terpial.
[03:26:49.009 --> 03:26:57.575]  It's kind of funny, because it kind of sounds like a Tirpid car, which is actually kind of a reflection of the policies there in Venezuela.
[03:26:57.875 --> 03:26:58.716]  Socialist policies.
[03:26:59.256 --> 03:26:59.596]  Tirpid.
[03:27:00.097 --> 03:27:00.437]  Foul.
[03:27:01.418 --> 03:27:01.678]  Base.
[03:27:01.738 --> 03:27:02.058]  Wicked.
[03:27:02.598 --> 03:27:03.439]  Morally depraved.
[03:27:03.639 --> 03:27:04.960]  You know, just steal whatever you want.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.342]  And of course we saw this happen with Hugo Chavez.
[03:27:07.822 --> 03:27:15.808]  He nationalized a lot of industries, and then he was eventually thrown out a coalition of people who were conservatives, libertarians, even socialists.
[03:27:16.903 --> 03:27:17.744]  Threw this guy out.
[03:27:18.404 --> 03:27:19.845]  Because he was nothing but a kleptocrat.
[03:27:19.905 --> 03:27:23.987]  See, socialism, communism, always devolves into a kleptocracy.
[03:27:24.007 --> 03:27:27.530]  There you can see the terpial, or as I like to call it, the terpid.
[03:27:28.370 --> 03:27:29.731]  It was funny when they were talking about it.
[03:27:31.352 --> 03:27:33.773]  Venezuela and Iran will deliver their first 300.
[03:27:34.054 --> 03:27:37.256]  Boy, they've got a big, ambitious plan there.
[03:27:37.276 --> 03:27:38.036]  They're going to make 300 cars.
[03:27:39.897 --> 03:27:48.901]  Anybody that knows anything about tooling up to make a car, you know that you're not going to set up to do 300 unless you're going to set up some kind of a hyper car that's going to sell for millions of dollars.
[03:27:49.362 --> 03:27:52.683]  But they're going to have their first 300 anti-imperialist cars.
[03:27:52.743 --> 03:27:53.604]  I looked at that.
[03:27:53.644 --> 03:27:55.144]  What is an anti-imperialist car?
[03:27:56.105 --> 03:27:59.026]  Is that something that is opposed to the old Chrysler Imperial?
[03:27:59.726 --> 03:28:02.048]  Is it exactly the opposite of the Chrysler Imperial?
[03:28:02.308 --> 03:28:05.229]  Actually, it looked very much like some car from the 1970s.
[03:28:07.654 --> 03:28:16.382]  And of course it failed, just like their socialist policies from the early 20th century have failed, because they, as I was saying, they always devolved into a kleptocracy.
[03:28:16.662 --> 03:28:25.650]  When Hugo Chávez went in and seized all these other industries, and he was eventually driven out by a coalition across the spectrum, because they understood he was just a crook.
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:40.665]  And when he got driven out, he and his friends, who had nationalized all these different corporations, then decided at the last minute that they would privatize them and that they would be the ones who would be holding the stock in these companies.
[03:28:40.785 --> 03:28:43.506]  That's exactly the way this always works out.
[03:28:44.126 --> 03:28:50.228]  But we have to be very careful in this country as to allowing these people to take over all of our
[03:28:50.908 --> 03:28:52.090]  Freedom of Transportation.
[03:28:52.290 --> 03:28:54.212]  That's what's on the chopping block here, folks.
[03:28:54.593 --> 03:28:56.054]  It's not simply a car factory.
[03:28:56.555 --> 03:29:02.242]  They're taking over our freedom of movement to confine us into their quote-unquote smart cities.
[03:29:02.923 --> 03:29:09.791]  Now when we come back, I want to talk about the move by Attorney General Sessions saying that they're going to
[03:29:11.155 --> 03:29:13.056]  Seek a way to come after Julian Assange.
[03:29:13.076 --> 03:29:15.836]  I want to talk about freedom of the press and what's involved in that.
[03:29:16.296 --> 03:29:28.239]  And as we look at this attack in Paris, Paul Watson did a great job of covering the politics there in Europe, of course, but we need to take a look at what is happening with Muslim culture in America.
[03:29:28.319 --> 03:29:30.140]  How do we counter that?
[03:29:31.004 --> 03:29:31.924]  Will they take that over?
[03:29:31.984 --> 03:29:33.625]  Will they take over our culture?
[03:29:33.685 --> 03:29:36.906]  Will it be something that we see happening in this country?
[03:29:36.926 --> 03:29:40.347]  So we're going to take a look at the move of Islam in America.
[03:29:40.827 --> 03:29:41.187]  Stay with us.
[03:29:41.207 --> 03:29:41.787]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:51.790 --> 03:29:52.710]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.190 --> 03:29:54.791]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.731 --> 03:29:58.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.662 --> 03:30:13.531]  UC Berkeley, which has been the battleground for free speech, has cancelled conservative commentator Ann Coulter's speaking event, citing safety concerns.
[03:30:13.731 --> 03:30:18.455]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short notice.
[03:30:18.635 --> 03:30:26.298]  For a later date on May 2nd, which would be during Dead Week, when students are not even in class as they prep for finals.
[03:30:26.558 --> 03:30:38.201]  So essentially, Berkeley is appeasing the temper tantrum-throwing Antifa by canceling conservative speaker events that were properly invited by recognized student groups.
[03:30:38.522 --> 03:30:42.963]  Kulture has stated that she plans to speak at Berkeley despite the cancellation and has
[03:30:43.163 --> 03:30:50.326]  Criticized Berkeley's chief of police for allowing Rodney King-style riots to go on when only conservative speakers speak.
[03:30:50.466 --> 03:30:59.750]  Berkeley was known as the birthplace of the student-led free speech movement in the 1960s and now it's becoming the birthplace of student-led censorship.
[03:30:59.890 --> 03:31:02.751]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com
[03:31:03.493 --> 03:31:11.241]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:31:11.481 --> 03:31:17.887]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:31:18.128 --> 03:31:26.416]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:31:26.676 --> 03:31:35.441]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:31:35.701 --> 03:31:41.444]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:31:41.784 --> 03:31:42.244]  It works.
[03:31:42.544 --> 03:31:50.846]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[03:31:50.866 --> 03:32:00.389]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[03:32:00.749 --> 03:32:01.249]  A total 360 win.

[03:32:19.628 --> 03:32:36.512]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:32:36.912 --> 03:32:39.014]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:32:39.374 --> 03:32:40.575]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:32:40.855 --> 03:32:41.616]  Easy assembly.
[03:32:41.896 --> 03:32:42.517]  Low maintenance.
[03:32:42.817 --> 03:32:44.639]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:33:10.905 --> 03:33:11.806]  You found it.
[03:33:12.146 --> 03:33:13.587]  The tip of the spear.
[03:33:14.148 --> 03:33:18.612]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[03:33:22.555 --> 03:33:26.198]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.278 --> 03:33:26.879]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:27.589 --> 03:33:32.830]  I want to switch gears here to attacks on what I see as the First Amendment.
[03:33:33.111 --> 03:33:34.671]  Attacks on WikiLeaks.
[03:33:35.271 --> 03:33:37.472]  And I think this headline from Andy War says it all.
[03:33:37.552 --> 03:33:41.173]  Attorney General Sessions seeks to jail publishers of leaks.
[03:33:42.053 --> 03:33:43.994]  This is the essence of what we're looking at here.
[03:33:44.714 --> 03:33:55.697]  And when you look at the most recent anger that we've seen from Pompeo about CIA Director Pompeo saying, hey, these people are our enemies.
[03:33:56.995 --> 03:33:58.036]  We need to do something about it.
[03:34:16.192 --> 03:34:27.798]  Then the CIA that is pushing these things out onto your computers, sprinkling them out in the public domain, they would be distributing classified information and they could go to jail.
[03:34:27.918 --> 03:34:28.839]  Wouldn't that be interesting?
[03:34:29.399 --> 03:34:33.821]  So they don't classify these hacks, this code that they're putting onto your computer.
[03:34:34.341 --> 03:34:36.703]  They don't copyright it either because they want to keep it secret.
[03:34:38.123 --> 03:34:41.285]  And they don't control it either because it leaked out and it was out there.
[03:34:41.365 --> 03:34:42.926]  One of the things that WikiLeaks is doing
[03:34:43.689 --> 03:35:12.052]  was warning people about this so that the different internet providers and software companies could fix the holes that the CIA had exploited to give you, the citizens of America, the citizens of all over the country, all over the world, to give all of us who aren't part of this deep, dark, secret state, to give us the ability to protect ourselves, not just from them,
[03:35:12.873 --> 03:35:20.879]  But from any criminals who might get this information, use it to steal our identity, or steal our bank account, or do any number of things.
[03:35:21.019 --> 03:35:33.508]  Because we are all at risk when the CIA creates these burglar tools, and puts them out for everybody to use, and then tells different companies that have relationships with them, don't fix those holes.
[03:35:34.329 --> 03:35:36.030]  So WikiLeaks put that information out there.
[03:35:36.050 --> 03:35:41.734]  A lot of the companies did not want to have any more information about that, did not correspond to them, did not fix the holes.
[03:35:41.754 --> 03:35:43.175]  They've left these things vulnerable.
[03:35:44.336 --> 03:35:54.863]  So you have a lot of very powerful multinational corporations, part of the military-industrial complex, the military-industrial surveillance complex that is now working with the CIA.
[03:35:54.903 --> 03:36:03.469]  They're also going to be exposed and shamed and humiliated by WikiLeaks because they're going to talk about who is not fixing the vulnerabilities in their software.
[03:36:04.420 --> 03:36:07.061]  They've already mentioned that Google didn't seem to be very responsive.
[03:36:07.081 --> 03:36:08.722]  I don't know if that's changed since then.
[03:36:09.562 --> 03:36:13.363]  But they said they're going to put out a list talking about those who wanted to fix it and those who didn't.
[03:36:13.384 --> 03:36:16.745]  They said, for example, Cisco was very interested in fixing their stuff and others.
[03:36:17.165 --> 03:36:19.126]  They mentioned saying, hey, they got in contact with us.
[03:36:19.626 --> 03:36:24.068]  We've been working with them to fix the vulnerabilities in their software.
[03:36:24.248 --> 03:36:27.729]  But others who have relationships with the government don't want to do it.
[03:36:27.909 --> 03:36:30.050]  But I want to talk about the legal aspects of this.
[03:36:30.750 --> 03:36:32.271]  We have this story on the Washington Post.
[03:36:33.843 --> 03:36:41.788]  Saying that the Justice Department is debating charges against WikiLeaks members because of CIA materials and so forth and so on.
[03:36:42.189 --> 03:36:50.094]  And of course it's interesting that the Washington Post for many years, and so has the New York Times, they publish people who are whistleblowers.
[03:36:50.655 --> 03:36:58.340]  You know, I mean, when people expose criminal actions by our government, should we the people not know that?
[03:37:00.208 --> 03:37:14.643]  I think that New York Times and CNN and Washington Post and Wikileaks and Infowars, anybody who publishes that, I think we ought to be grateful that that kind of information is published, instead of throwing the whistleblowers in jail, throwing the journalists in jail, which is what Obama
[03:37:15.478 --> 03:37:16.018]  Wanted to do.
[03:37:16.358 --> 03:37:24.681]  Obama put more journalists and whistleblowers in jail using a 100 year old act, the 1917 Espionage Act.
[03:37:25.042 --> 03:37:29.803]  He put more journalists and whistleblowers in jail than all the other presidents before him combined.
[03:37:29.903 --> 03:37:34.265]  So is this going to be the continuation, the continuing policy of the Trump administration?
[03:37:34.905 --> 03:37:35.506]  I hope not.
[03:37:36.046 --> 03:37:36.506]  I hope not.
[03:37:37.575 --> 03:37:47.717]  And the attorney for Julian Assange, his name is Barry J. Pollack, said that the Justice Department officials had not discussed with him or Assange the status of any investigation, despite his request that they do so.
[03:37:48.118 --> 03:37:54.359]  He said there was, quote, no legitimate basis for the Department of Justice to treat WikiLeaks differently than it treats other journalists.
[03:37:54.499 --> 03:37:58.020]  He said the fact of the matter is, well of course they've tried to jail journalists,
[03:37:58.380 --> 03:38:10.988]  When you expose their criminal actions, they don't do anything to the people who are violating the law, violating the Constitution, violating the trust that has been put in them, the blind trust that we put in these people, because we're not allowed to see anything that they do.
[03:38:11.028 --> 03:38:12.008]  They operate in the dark.
[03:38:12.689 --> 03:38:14.590]  Trust me, it's a matter of national security.
[03:38:14.610 --> 03:38:15.651]  I can't tell you anything about it.
[03:38:15.691 --> 03:38:17.392]  They redact and black out everything.
[03:38:18.052 --> 03:38:21.114]  That's what you ought to be ashamed of and angry about.
[03:38:22.214 --> 03:38:23.135]  But they're not ashamed of it.
[03:38:24.356 --> 03:38:26.117]  And the American people aren't angry enough about it.
[03:38:27.375 --> 03:38:34.059]  And so what they do is they jail the whistleblowers, they jail the people who expose the crimes, but the criminals in the government stay there.
[03:38:34.580 --> 03:38:43.846]  He said, the fact of the matter is, this is Julian Assange, lawyer, Pollack, however frustrating it might be to whoever looks bad when the information is published, WikiLeaks is a publisher.
[03:38:44.566 --> 03:38:49.629]  And they are publishing truthful, truthful information, folks.
[03:38:50.230 --> 03:38:52.551]  And it is in the public's interest.
[03:38:53.352 --> 03:38:56.534]  Truthful information in the public's interest.
[03:38:58.086 --> 03:39:04.127]  Democracy, he said, thrives because there are independent journalists reporting on what the government is doing.
[03:39:04.308 --> 03:39:12.370]  I mean, even the Washington Post, they've changed their moniker, and it's a pretty stupid moniker, especially when you look at the way the Washington Post is slanting the information.
[03:39:12.390 --> 03:39:16.391]  But, of course, their subtitle, their new motto is, Democracy Dies in Darkness.
[03:39:16.411 --> 03:39:17.511]  Well, it does die in darkness.
[03:39:18.431 --> 03:39:26.073]  If you're allowed to hide all this information, and if you're allowed to, are they going to then, if Wikileaks or Whistleblower exposes this,
[03:39:27.495 --> 03:39:34.920]  I mean, is it okay for the Washington Post to publish something that a whistleblower puts out, but if WikiLeaks does it, WikiLeaks is going to go to jail?
[03:39:35.920 --> 03:39:43.705]  What if WikiLeaks publishes it first, and then the Washington Post quotes what WikiLeaks puts out, or they link to what WikiLeaks puts out?
[03:39:43.985 --> 03:39:45.606]  Is then the Washington Post going to go to jail?
[03:39:45.626 --> 03:39:55.152]  Do you understand there is no end when we get on this slippery slope of censorship to say that we can't know what's going on with our government, even when it's violating the laws?
[03:39:56.294 --> 03:40:02.282]  WikiLeaks lawyer Pollack noted the course of the Obama administration has been no shrinking violet when it came to pursuing reporters and journalists.
[03:40:02.302 --> 03:40:07.549]  Like I said, they've rested more in the last 100 years than all the previous presidents combined.
[03:40:07.709 --> 03:40:14.297]  And remember, we had the CIA director, the new CIA director, called WikiLeaks a non-state hostile intelligence service.
[03:40:15.797 --> 03:40:29.588]  And I would say that what we are continually seeing is that the CIA is a secret state that is hostile to our Constitution, hostile to the values that we want in this country.
[03:40:30.049 --> 03:40:32.571]  They don't make us safer, they make us less safe.
[03:40:32.651 --> 03:40:34.092]  Vault 7 is a good example of it.
[03:40:35.153 --> 03:40:40.237]  They collect and create these burglar tools and leave them out there for anybody and everybody to use.
[03:40:41.343 --> 03:40:46.226]  And they tell these companies don't fix the vulnerabilities that they've worked with to create these vulnerabilities.
[03:40:46.646 --> 03:40:57.613]  And then they also point out in a recent Washington Post op-ed piece, Julian Assange said that his group's motive was, quote, identical to the motive claimed by the New York Times and the Washington Post to publish newsworthy content.
[03:40:57.633 --> 03:41:04.958]  He said the media has a long history of speaking truth to power with prolonged or leaked material.
[03:41:05.518 --> 03:41:06.479]  And he gives some examples.
[03:41:06.619 --> 03:41:11.523]  Jack Anderson's reporting on the CIA's enlistment of the mafia to kill Fidel Castro.
[03:41:11.883 --> 03:41:16.646]  Maybe the public should consider whether they want the CIA doing that type of thing.
[03:41:18.308 --> 03:41:19.829]  Should the CIA be assassinating people?
[03:41:19.849 --> 03:41:22.631]  Well, I guess we've had that discussion and the public is just fine with that.
[03:41:22.671 --> 03:41:25.093]  As long as we do it with drones and that sort of thing.
[03:41:25.133 --> 03:41:27.715]  I'm not fine with it, but the public seems to be fine with it.
[03:41:28.260 --> 03:41:37.047]  Nevertheless, the Providence Journal Bulletin's release of President Nixon's stolen tax returns, the New York Times publication of the stolen Pentagon Papers, remember that?
[03:41:37.968 --> 03:41:40.850]  The Post's tenacious reporting of Watergate leaks.
[03:41:42.151 --> 03:41:45.694]  And of course, that was being leaked to them by the number two guy at the FBI.
[03:41:46.134 --> 03:41:47.936]  And of course, the FBI has never been political.
[03:41:49.967 --> 03:41:54.431]  Go back and look at the history of J. Edgar Hoover, and this was his number two guy, okay?
[03:41:54.592 --> 03:42:01.398]  Nevertheless, as long as he wrote, he says, I hope historians place WikiLeaks publications in this pantheon.
[03:42:02.239 --> 03:42:04.321]  Yet there's widespread calls to prosecute me.
[03:42:04.341 --> 03:42:06.643]  And this is something he wrote before they started talking about that.
[03:42:07.686 --> 03:42:12.771]  He says he believes that the Justice Department rules barred a prosecution of him.
[03:42:12.791 --> 03:42:23.281]  He said if they follow their rules, if they follow the First Amendment, they shouldn't be pursuing a prosecution because we have a long history going back decades.
[03:42:23.541 --> 03:42:28.466]  We want to know when our government is involved in criminal action and that's what they've done for us.
[03:42:28.706 --> 03:42:30.347]  But let's take a look at the other side of the First Amendment.
[03:42:30.367 --> 03:42:36.810]  Of course, we have this back and forth going on with Ann Coulter, whether she's going to be allowed to go to Janet Napolitano's Berkeley.
[03:42:36.831 --> 03:42:42.474]  You know, Janet Napolitano, she goes from being big sis to big brother, I guess, at Berkeley.
[03:42:42.494 --> 03:42:48.517]  But nevertheless, Howard Dean says, in talking about that, hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment.
[03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:51.230]  And then, of course, who declares what is hate?
[03:42:51.651 --> 03:42:53.092]  Who declares what is truth?
[03:42:53.892 --> 03:42:55.713]  Who declares what is controversial?
[03:42:55.753 --> 03:43:07.141]  And, of course, we've seen all of this being brought up by Google, by Facebook, by the Democrats, saying even the FCC, the FEC, saying we're going to shut down anything we think is hateful.
[03:43:07.201 --> 03:43:09.002]  And we will be the judges of whether it's hateful.
[03:43:09.042 --> 03:43:13.825]  We're going to shut down anything that we think is not truthful, and we will be the judges of whether or not it's truthful.
[03:43:13.865 --> 03:43:16.366]  And then, even to the point that YouTube is saying,
[03:43:17.347 --> 03:43:21.133]  If we think your videos are controversial, we'll kill the monetization of it.
[03:43:21.975 --> 03:43:25.601]  Doesn't even have to be something that's hateful or false in their estimate.
[03:43:25.621 --> 03:43:26.582]  They don't even have to defend that.
[03:43:26.602 --> 03:43:28.585]  They just have to say, well, we think it's a little bit controversial.
[03:43:29.066 --> 03:43:31.751]  Maybe it's talking about religion, so we'll shut that down.
[03:43:32.842 --> 03:43:34.543]  And so this is where it goes, folks.
[03:43:34.883 --> 03:43:36.904]  And here's a good example from the week.
[03:43:36.944 --> 03:43:42.347]  And this was on Drudge Report today, talking about how Google operates as a monopoly.
[03:43:42.447 --> 03:43:46.630]  And it was an interesting example because they had this website called Celebrity Net Worth.
[03:43:47.330 --> 03:43:49.571]  They had a guy who founded this back in 2008, so nine years ago.
[03:43:51.592 --> 03:43:55.515]  He was kind of curious about how much Larry David had a net worth of.
[03:43:55.535 --> 03:43:57.996]  Of course, he's a guy who was involved with Seinfeld and many other things.
[03:43:58.056 --> 03:44:00.498]  So he couldn't find any good data on it.
[03:44:00.538 --> 03:44:02.279]  So he thought, well, maybe other people are interested in it.
[03:44:02.339 --> 03:44:04.040]  So he started up a small media business.
[03:44:04.060 --> 03:44:08.523]  He eventually had a staff of 12 people to conduct detailed investigations.
[03:44:08.663 --> 03:44:16.888]  Then Google came up with the idea that they would do something themselves called featured snippets, which would give you the answers to search queries at the top of the search page.
[03:44:16.908 --> 03:44:18.049]  Well, that was his business.
[03:44:18.829 --> 03:44:25.271]  And so they came to him and they said, uh, well, you know, we want to do some stuff on Celebrity Net Worth, so, uh, we'd like to use your information.
[03:44:25.291 --> 03:44:32.833]  He said, no, that's my business, and I spend a lot of money creating that content, and I'm not just going to give it to you for free.
[03:44:33.953 --> 03:44:34.913]  So he declined.
[03:44:35.673 --> 03:44:36.694]  And then they did it anyway.
[03:44:37.354 --> 03:44:43.475]  They scraped his site, they took the information off, and he said, the interesting thing was, this was about a year ago, February 2016, he had, um,
[03:44:46.960 --> 03:44:53.522]  Put in some fake listings for friends who are not celebrities to see if they would pop up in Google's featured answers.
[03:44:54.423 --> 03:44:54.863]  And they did.
[03:44:56.023 --> 03:44:56.803]  So they're going in.
[03:44:57.204 --> 03:44:58.424]  They don't vet the information.
[03:44:58.824 --> 03:44:59.644]  They don't do the work.
[03:45:00.105 --> 03:45:01.545]  They don't create the original content.
[03:45:01.585 --> 03:45:03.846]  They steal it and they monetize it.
[03:45:04.606 --> 03:45:07.727]  But the other part of this is that they're not just taking over somebody's business.
[03:45:08.308 --> 03:45:14.750]  They're not just taking over and shutting down the people who are actual content creators, who actually do the research, who put the stuff together.
[03:45:15.700 --> 03:45:19.963]  Instead, what they're doing is they're creating their own narrative, their own news.
[03:45:20.223 --> 03:45:21.623]  See, that's the way that they can do this.
[03:45:21.643 --> 03:45:23.024]  This is where we really need to be concerned.
[03:45:23.044 --> 03:45:24.145]  That's another level of it.
[03:45:24.425 --> 03:45:32.410]  Yes, they create a monopoly, but they also, just like Facebook and Twitter, they also want to control content in a way that is politicized.
[03:45:33.410 --> 03:45:35.751]  And so it isn't simply that they're doing this for the money.
[03:45:35.791 --> 03:45:46.794]  Yes, they're doing it for the money and they get a lot of sweetheart deals and crony capitalism involved with the government when they help the government with their narratives when they push this through.
[03:45:47.275 --> 03:45:52.016]  And as I point out, this is something we all should start looking at and try to help some of their competitors.
[03:45:52.056 --> 03:45:54.417]  They point out that in this article that DuckDuckGo
[03:45:55.217 --> 03:45:57.979]  Is a superior tool when looking for less immediate material.
[03:45:58.060 --> 03:46:01.622]  They said 80% of the online search traffic there is first mover advantage.
[03:46:01.642 --> 03:46:12.551]  In other words, they're looking for the people who are creating the content, trying to reward the people who create the content, instead of the people who just steal it and then monetize their theft, which is what's going on.
[03:46:12.611 --> 03:46:14.073]  Another example of this, the Newseum.
[03:46:14.753 --> 03:46:17.936]  This is a story from a couple of days ago from the Free Beacon.
[03:46:19.008 --> 03:46:23.469]  And if you don't know, the Newseum is a museum of news in Washington, D.C.
[03:46:24.249 --> 03:46:29.170]  And they're oh so special about their worship of the First Amendment.
[03:46:29.190 --> 03:46:39.453]  They have a great big marble plaque to the First Amendment when you walk in the place and they want to tell you about news and how important news is and it's the fourth estate and so forth and so on.
[03:46:39.513 --> 03:46:43.674]  And they just gave a free speech award to Apple's CEO, Tim Cook.
[03:46:44.838 --> 03:46:54.380]  This is a guy, you know, like Facebook, who has bowed down to every demand for censorship that is given to him, except when it is in America, okay?
[03:46:54.420 --> 03:46:59.822]  So it was only a few months ago that Apple removed the New York Times app from the Chinese version of the App Store.
[03:47:00.962 --> 03:47:04.523]  So they took out the New York Times because the Chinese didn't like the New York Times.
[03:47:04.543 --> 03:47:10.524]  You think the Chinese government wants InfoWars on the App Store?
[03:47:11.065 --> 03:47:11.885]  Do you think they want
[03:47:13.055 --> 03:47:17.279]  Do you think that Apple wants any of our news articles on Apple News?
[03:47:17.400 --> 03:47:20.062]  No, they want to try to curate the news for you.
[03:47:20.102 --> 03:47:22.265]  They want to try to take control of the news for you.
[03:47:23.155 --> 03:47:33.222]  And as they point out in this Free Beacon story, they say the move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read the New York Times without resorting to special software.
[03:47:33.862 --> 03:47:38.465]  And this wasn't the first time that Apple had accommodated the communist dictatorship in its quest to deny.
[03:47:38.585 --> 03:47:42.848]  Apple has previously removed other less prominent media apps from its China store.
[03:47:43.489 --> 03:47:49.092]  The Times asked Apple what was going on and they said, well, we're merely complying with the request of Chinese authorities.
[03:47:49.112 --> 03:47:50.814]  And they said, well, it's funny, but a year earlier,
[03:47:51.554 --> 03:47:58.621]  He self-righteously refused to comply with the FBI request to unlock an iPhone for an investigation of the San Bernardino shooting terrorist.
[03:47:58.701 --> 03:48:01.964]  And understand, that was nothing but virtue signaling.
[03:48:02.084 --> 03:48:05.548]  They're giving this information to the government when they want it.
[03:48:08.740 --> 03:48:24.032]  When this whole debate was going on, so I talked to John McAfee, interviewing him, he said, we said, you can't give tools over to the FBI, as the FBI was demanding anyway, because the FBI isn't going to be able to keep track of them.
[03:48:24.052 --> 03:48:24.693]  They're going to lose them.
[03:48:24.713 --> 03:48:26.494]  They're going to go into the public domain.
[03:48:27.335 --> 03:48:36.662]  And that was, what, a couple of months, several months before we saw Vault 7, which showed that the CIA's hacking tools got out into the public domain.
[03:48:38.007 --> 03:48:39.268]  John McAfee was exactly right.
[03:48:39.308 --> 03:48:41.549]  They're not going to protect your privacy.
[03:48:42.450 --> 03:48:45.272]  They're not going to keep control of these tools.
[03:48:45.332 --> 03:48:47.053]  We don't want to let them have those tools.
[03:48:47.614 --> 03:48:52.757]  And they say, you know, what connection does Tim Cook have to the cause of the free press other than suppressing it for profit?
[03:48:53.858 --> 03:49:02.864]  And then they pointed out at the very bottom of the article, so why would they give Tim Cook, Apple computer, removing even the New York Times if the Chinese government demands it?
[03:49:03.445 --> 03:49:05.046]  Why would they give him an honor like this?
[03:49:06.352 --> 03:49:16.058]  And as he said, well, somebody who was a commenter on this story said that Apple is a platinum sponsor of the Newseum's Free Expression Awards.
[03:49:16.098 --> 03:49:18.359]  How's that for irony and hypocrisy?
[03:49:18.880 --> 03:49:21.181]  And as he says, mystery solved.
[03:49:21.761 --> 03:49:22.222]  Exactly.
[03:49:22.242 --> 03:49:33.529]  That's what we just saw with GM, how they're going to make sure that they don't have somebody at the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration shut down their crazy scheme to just have the car
[03:49:34.849 --> 03:49:36.310]  Shut down in the middle of the road.
[03:49:36.991 --> 03:49:38.832]  I want to move over to what's going on.
[03:49:39.112 --> 03:49:48.118]  As I said, Paul covered the politics on the French side of this, but we need to take a look at what's going on worldwide with terrorism, with Islam.
[03:49:48.478 --> 03:50:02.447]  There's a story by WND about how Muslims want to have blasphemers prosecuted worldwide, and they're using the United Nations to try to push for censorship laws, just as we're talking about Google and China censoring people, and of course we have
[03:50:03.327 --> 03:50:07.992]  China now taking control of Hollywood because they want to control that part of the narrative as well.
[03:50:08.012 --> 03:50:17.962]  They say that on WND they say for years Islamic nations have successfully pressed the UN to pass non-binding resolutions that would condemn the defamation of religion.
[03:50:18.002 --> 03:50:20.164]  But what they really want in countries like Pakistan
[03:50:21.125 --> 03:50:24.728]  Is to have criminal penalties for blasphemy.
[03:50:24.748 --> 03:50:33.914]  They had Pakistan's Interior Ministry, his last name is Khan, like the guy that Hillary Clinton had who was a big advocate of Sharia law.
[03:50:34.775 --> 03:50:37.857]  They had him talk about what he was going to do.
[03:50:37.897 --> 03:50:42.660]  They want to expedite anyone who is overseas and accused of Islamic blasphemy.
[03:50:43.301 --> 03:50:49.085]  So they want all the social media and the search engines to help them to find anybody that is even criticizing Islam.
[03:50:49.898 --> 03:50:50.859]  And then extradite them.
[03:50:50.879 --> 03:50:52.861]  Well, of course, that isn't going to happen in the US and the UK.
[03:50:53.621 --> 03:50:58.286]  But of course, it will happen if you travel to some of the 25, 30 Muslim countries.
[03:50:58.326 --> 03:51:01.068]  They might arrest you and extradite you to Pakistan.
[03:51:01.088 --> 03:51:01.468]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.729 --> 03:51:02.790]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:07.954 --> 03:51:14.100]  Someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[03:51:14.502 --> 03:51:21.687]  This young generation, who scream words like fascist, have actually themselves become the fascists.
[03:51:21.948 --> 03:51:23.329]  You guys are the fascists!
[03:51:23.689 --> 03:51:25.050]  You're all the fascists!
[03:51:25.370 --> 03:51:26.611]  You're a white male!
[03:51:26.751 --> 03:51:34.017]  I just wish that somebody would create like some kind of a safe space where we could all just go and f***ing hate!
[03:51:34.537 --> 03:51:39.841]  You're a f***ing white man who gets to do whatever he wants to in this space, right?
[03:51:39.881 --> 03:51:40.942]  You need to get out.
[03:51:41.082 --> 03:51:42.023]  I actually don't.
[03:51:42.083 --> 03:51:42.403]  Alright.
[03:51:44.818 --> 03:51:48.620]  Get this reporter out of here!
[03:51:48.760 --> 03:51:51.862]  I need the muscle over here!
[03:51:52.342 --> 03:51:59.386]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[03:52:01.467 --> 03:52:08.751]  So the question is, are social justice warriors mentally ill, or are they just stupid?
[03:52:09.071 --> 03:52:10.772]  When your emotions control your actions,
[03:52:11.784 --> 03:52:14.668]  It affects not only yourself, but the people around you.
[03:52:16.372 --> 03:52:24.935]  There are over 7 million mentally ill and emotionally disturbed children in America.
[03:52:24.955 --> 03:52:26.155]  This has to be a joke!
[03:52:26.235 --> 03:52:27.855]  I can't believe this is happening!
[03:52:28.176 --> 03:52:31.296]  I'm literally about to f***ing kill myself and I'm not kidding!
[03:52:31.356 --> 03:52:34.157]  You better f***ing fix this right now!
[03:52:34.197 --> 03:52:35.438]  Get the f*** out of here!
[03:52:35.498 --> 03:52:37.398]  He's losing control of himself.
[03:52:37.418 --> 03:52:38.338]  Get your phone away!
[03:52:38.358 --> 03:52:38.418]  Why?
[03:52:38.438 --> 03:52:39.799]  Quit recording!
[03:52:39.819 --> 03:52:42.079]  The madder he gets, the worse it becomes.
[03:52:42.119 --> 03:52:42.980]  Get the f*** away!
[03:52:46.302 --> 03:52:48.684]  You couldn't help interrupting, could you?
[03:52:48.864 --> 03:52:54.969]  You added nothing to that conversation.
[03:52:55.029 --> 03:52:58.031]  These are some of Tommy's drawings that the school sent over.
[03:52:59.132 --> 03:53:01.634]  There's an awful lot of hate in them.
[03:53:01.654 --> 03:53:04.417]  I am a nasty woman.
[03:53:13.320 --> 03:53:17.446]  Like your wet dreams infused with your own genes.
[03:53:17.506 --> 03:53:21.791]  But yeah, I'm a nasty woman.
[03:53:21.931 --> 03:53:28.160]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[03:53:28.260 --> 03:53:30.202]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[03:53:33.680 --> 03:53:35.301]  You think our information's hardcore?

[03:54:09.358 --> 03:54:10.781]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:10.861 --> 03:54:11.382]  I'm David Nye.
[03:54:11.402 --> 03:54:18.075]  We have one more segment before we get back to the news and a warning to people in America, especially to churches.
[03:54:18.926 --> 03:54:21.208]  About the shootings that we've seen abroad.
[03:54:21.228 --> 03:54:24.630]  Of course, we had this article from Michael Snyder a day or so ago.
[03:54:25.010 --> 03:54:29.293]  Islamic terrorists will be specifically targeting Christians and churches in America.
[03:54:29.353 --> 03:54:34.756]  He wrote that before we saw the specific targeting of police in Paris.
[03:54:34.957 --> 03:54:36.297]  But of course, we know they're going to do that.
[03:54:36.918 --> 03:54:39.379]  We've had terrorists target churches in the past.
[03:54:39.399 --> 03:54:41.161]  They targeted them in South Africa.
[03:54:41.181 --> 03:54:44.383]  I had a very interesting interview with Charles Von Vick.
[03:54:45.123 --> 03:54:49.890]  Who was in South Africa at the time they had the communist terrorists there were trying to take over that country.
[03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:54.816]  They specifically targeted a white liberal church because they knew nobody there would be armed.
[03:54:55.057 --> 03:54:58.141]  They didn't know that this guy was going to be visiting the church.
[03:54:58.842 --> 03:54:59.603]  He had a gun.
[03:55:00.653 --> 03:55:01.674]  Only had five bullets.
[03:55:01.694 --> 03:55:08.521]  These guys came in throwing hand grenades, spraying the church with automatic machine gun fire.
[03:55:09.262 --> 03:55:11.564]  He was able to save a thousand people there.
[03:55:11.604 --> 03:55:16.329]  This is a video and it's only at about 23,000 views and it's a year or two old.
[03:55:16.809 --> 03:55:20.353]  Five bullets to save a thousand people from four terrorists.
[03:55:20.493 --> 03:55:24.277]  Take a look at that because it's an amazing story how that worked out.
[03:55:25.018 --> 03:55:27.220]  You need to take responsibility for your safety.
[03:55:27.240 --> 03:55:33.667]  You know, the strict California gun control laws, as Breitbart pointed out, were absolutely impotent to stop the Fresno attack.
[03:55:34.728 --> 03:55:46.881]  And I want to read to you from Michael Snyder's article here, the point he was making about something that had just happened in South Dakota, not even going back to this story from South Africa from Sharla Fundvik.
[03:55:47.638 --> 03:55:51.499]  But before we do, I just want to remind you that we have extended our Easter Mega Special.
[03:55:52.179 --> 03:56:00.622]  We have 25% off Super Male, Super Female Vitality, 25% off Survival Shield, X2 nasonidine, 25% off Secret 12.

[03:56:08.504 --> 03:56:09.864]  Very easy to assimilate.
[03:56:09.904 --> 03:56:12.325]  Also, things like our multivitamin

[03:56:20.940 --> 03:56:22.180]  That's also 25% off.
[03:56:22.300 --> 03:56:24.241]  And 30% off Brain Force.
[03:56:24.261 --> 03:56:28.743]  You can find all these specials and many more at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:56:29.523 --> 03:56:31.404]  Now I want to go back to this article.
[03:56:31.444 --> 03:56:39.087]  As Michael Snyder was pointing out, he said, once upon a time somebody storming in and firing automatic weapons into a crowd would have been unthinkable.
[03:56:39.127 --> 03:56:39.687]  But it's not.
[03:56:40.829 --> 03:56:43.751]  And it's only unthinkable because of the bubble that we lived in.
[03:56:43.791 --> 03:56:51.695]  But of course, terrorism, chaos, different competing cultures, divide and conquer, this is all being done deliberately.
[03:56:51.775 --> 03:57:00.560]  As I pointed out yesterday, Poland's foreign minister said, we are reaping a bloody harvest of multiculturalism and we're not going to let that happen in Poland.
[03:57:01.420 --> 03:57:09.836]  We've also had the Hungarian President or Prime Minister, I'm not sure what his exact title is, Viktor Orban, is also pushing back against this.
[03:57:09.896 --> 03:57:11.720]  Those two countries were on the forefront.
[03:57:12.680 --> 03:57:16.582]  of the attacks on Europe by Muslims in the past.
[03:57:16.642 --> 03:57:24.646]  They have a cultural memory of what happened with that, and they can see what's happening in the more naive areas like France and Germany.
[03:57:25.246 --> 03:57:26.187]  We're also very naive.
[03:57:26.207 --> 03:57:27.707]  We have a lot of people who want to invite this.
[03:57:28.548 --> 03:57:39.053]  And Michael Snyder pointed out, he says, something like this almost happened a little over a week ago at a hotel in South Dakota where about 500 people had gathered for a Christian conference.
[03:57:39.193 --> 03:57:41.234]  While they were there, an Islamic radical
[03:57:42.114 --> 03:57:43.735]  Had brought multiple firearms.
[03:57:43.755 --> 03:57:44.936]  This is on April the 9th.
[03:57:45.477 --> 03:57:49.700]  With him, he stormed into the major Christian conference in a hotel in South Dakota.
[03:57:50.241 --> 03:57:52.623]  And his actions had many people afraid for their lives.
[03:57:52.683 --> 03:57:56.006]  He entered this private gathering in the ballroom in South Dakota.
[03:57:56.026 --> 03:57:56.806]  He started cursing.
[03:57:57.086 --> 03:57:58.868]  He was live streaming video on Facebook.
[03:57:59.348 --> 03:58:00.609]  He said, I'm an American.
[03:58:00.649 --> 03:58:01.290]  I'm a Muslim.
[03:58:01.350 --> 03:58:02.011]  I open carry.
[03:58:02.051 --> 03:58:02.731]  I conceal carry.
[03:58:02.771 --> 03:58:04.413]  I'm dangerous only if you're stupid.
[03:58:04.453 --> 03:58:05.634]  He was told to leave and he did.
[03:58:05.694 --> 03:58:06.774]  But once he got back to his car,
[03:58:07.515 --> 03:58:13.760]  He showed off his arsenal of weapons, including military-style rifles, loaded magazines, three-hand guns, so forth.
[03:58:13.840 --> 03:58:14.661]  Be scared.
[03:58:14.701 --> 03:58:15.641]  Be effing scared.
[03:58:15.681 --> 03:58:16.802]  Be terrified, he said.
[03:58:17.283 --> 03:58:22.086]  So, he wasn't charged with a crime for doing any kind of assault or threat to people.
[03:58:22.487 --> 03:58:25.249]  But understand, this type of thing has happened in the past.
[03:58:25.309 --> 03:58:27.311]  And if you want to know, take a look at that video.
[03:58:27.331 --> 03:58:28.251]  You'll have to search for it.
[03:58:28.291 --> 03:58:32.595]  It's five bullets to save a thousand people from four terrorists.
[03:58:33.215 --> 03:58:36.037]  Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:36.097 --> 03:58:38.878]  Eastern, and stay with us for the live 3 to 5, coming up.
[03:58:45.102 --> 03:58:49.064]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.348 --> 03:59:03.235]  UC Berkeley, which has been the battleground for free speech, has cancelled conservative commentator Ann Coulter's speaking event, citing safety concerns.
[03:59:03.435 --> 03:59:15.983]  Coulter did say that the university tried to reschedule the event in short notice for a later date on May 2nd, which would be during dead week, when students are not even in class as they prep for finals.
[03:59:16.263 --> 03:59:27.893]  So essentially, Berkeley is appeasing the temper tantrum-throwing Antifa by canceling conservative speaker events that were properly invited by recognized student groups.
[03:59:28.213 --> 03:59:39.983]  Culture has stated that she plans to speak at Berkeley despite the cancellation and has criticized Berkeley's chief of police for allowing Rodney King-style riots to go on when only conservative speakers speak.
[03:59:40.163 --> 03:59:49.453]  Berkeley was known as the birthplace of the student-led free speech movement in the 1960s, and now it's becoming the birthplace of student-led censorship.
[03:59:49.593 --> 03:59:52.536]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:59:54.318 --> 03:59:59.624]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
