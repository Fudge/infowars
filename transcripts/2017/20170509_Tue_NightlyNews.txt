[00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.523]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:21.807]  It's Tuesday, May 9th, 2017.
[00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:25.337]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:28.942]  Denied.
[00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:39.592]  The spy state has reached unprecedented proportions, as secret messages are now being hidden in television ads, which can trigger smartphones to spy on people.
[00:00:39.612 --> 00:00:51.243]  Also, Al Gore is back with his non-existent $15 trillion tax on the non-existent man-made global warming, this time releasing a new movie despite the utter failure of his first film.
[00:00:52.123 --> 00:01:01.267]  Meanwhile, violence in Chicago, Illinois is out of control, as the 200th homicide this year alone has the entire community thinking twice.
[00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:16.154]  And then... The war propaganda against Syria may have reached new heights, as CNN released a new video with footage from the Aleppo Media Center.
[00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:20.536]  All that and more, tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:36.747]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:01:36.907 --> 00:01:37.487]  I take this.
[00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:38.788]  My family takes this.
[00:01:38.888 --> 00:01:43.112]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:47.656]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:52.340]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.461]  I don't feel good.
[00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:57.064]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.947]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:05.371]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.194]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:12.177]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.479]  So obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.900]  I love it.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.644]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:18.806]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:24.796]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:24.816 --> 00:02:26.438]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.902]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:06.938]  Well, the top story tonight, President Donald Trump has let James Comey know, you're fired.
[00:03:07.298 --> 00:03:18.941]  Now, the word is that it was the incoming, the newly sworn in Deputy Attorney General that recommended Mr. Comey be fired over how he disclosed the investigation into Mrs. Clinton.
[00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:21.321]  This is Rod Rosenstein.
[00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:28.783]  Of course, that would not make the rest of us very happy if that were true, because of course, we would like to see Hillary Clinton in prison.
[00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:31.063]  We're good to go.
[00:03:49.548 --> 00:04:04.202]  While I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.
[00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:07.265]  So this is the letter dated Tuesday to Mr. Comey.
[00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:20.834]  They've let him know he's terminated, he's to leave immediately, and the White House is now also immediately on the hunt for new leadership there at the FBI.
[00:04:21.554 --> 00:04:30.840]  Mr. Trump said that it is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.941]  So, very interesting stuff there.
[00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:38.604]  Of course, this is just coming days after Mr. Comey testified under oath and was talking about this.
[00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:44.548]  Again, no evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
[00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:57.355]  The FBI was forced to issue a statement correcting some misstatements that Comey made under oath where he said hundreds of thousands of emails were forwarded by Huma Abedin to her husband's laptop.
[00:04:57.915 --> 00:05:01.357]  They had to correct that, said it was only just a few, just a handful.
[00:05:01.838 --> 00:05:03.138]  Other things were duplicates.
[00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:12.685]  Still no wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin because the FBI director at the time decided that he couldn't find that they had any intent to break the law.
[00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:17.068]  They didn't mean to forward that classified information and mishandle it.
[00:05:17.808 --> 00:05:23.553]  And I think that I always get off of a speeding ticket when I, you know, explain to the officer I didn't mean.
[00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.413]  I didn't know.
[00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:27.896]  I didn't know that the speed limit wasn't 90 miles per hour.
[00:05:28.256 --> 00:05:30.578]  So, see you later, James Comey.
[00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:31.159]  Nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:31.799]  Goodbye.
[00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.581]  That's the big news there today.
[00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:35.487]  I don't know.
[00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:50.807]  We're good.
[00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:09.959]  I don't know.
[00:06:32.672 --> 00:06:49.397]  So this software is called Silver Push and it's designed to listen to audio beacons which humans cannot hear and they've allegedly been used by corporations such as McDonald's and Krispy Kreme and these researchers went into several different storefronts
[00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:50.078]  I think so.
[00:07:09.775 --> 00:07:10.295]  I think so.
[00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.772]  They can obtain detailed user profiles to deliver highly customized advertisements.
[00:07:34.232 --> 00:07:34.893]  So there you go.
[00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:44.418]  If you've ever been driving in your car talking about taking a trip to Tijuana and then all of a sudden an advertisement for Tijuana comes on the radio and you say, wow, how weird is that?
[00:07:44.758 --> 00:07:51.683]  Well, it's because your smart devices are constantly listening to you as we have been warning you for 10 plus years.
[00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:55.125]  Now we've got some big sanctuary city news.
[00:07:55.165 --> 00:07:57.947]  Of course, Texas here is cracked down.
[00:07:58.507 --> 00:08:00.388]  We don't want to become a sanctuary state.
[00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:11.516]  And now Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has already filed suit against local jurisdictions that have been accused of not cooperating with federal immigration agents.
[00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:17.240]  And so this is in a preemptive bid to uphold this newly signed anti-sanctuary city laws.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.701]  He filed the lawsuit.
[00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:19.801]  I think so.
[00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:43.119]  You could face fines of up to $25,000 per day, and you could face jail time.
[00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:53.803]  So now local officers are going to have to, and they will have the right to, even though here in Austin, in Travis County, they're trying to tell law enforcement officers they don't have the right to do that.
[00:08:54.083 --> 00:09:03.187]  Well, this is a preemptive bill that says, yes, you do have the right to ask the immigration status of anyone that you stop, and it is your duty to uphold the law.
[00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:09.849]  And they go on to point out that SB4 is constitutional, it's lawful, and it's a vital step in securing our borders.
[00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:16.551]  It's not racist, as the media here, at least locally, would have you believe.
[00:09:17.111 --> 00:09:27.574]  And in an interesting twist, the New York Times was trying to gauge the understanding and the perception of people who are in these potential sanctuary cities.
[00:09:28.752 --> 00:09:33.715]  And they ran the headline titled, Sanctuary Bills in Maryland Face a Surprise Foe.
[00:09:34.255 --> 00:09:35.175]  Legal immigrants!
[00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:36.036]  That's right!
[00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:38.857]  Legal immigrants oppose sanctuary laws.
[00:09:38.897 --> 00:09:42.859]  This is something that conservatives have been saying for the last few years.
[00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:53.304]  People here, legally, who actually went through the process of becoming a legal citizen, aren't going to be happy to see a number of people coming here illegally giving documentation.
[00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:55.866]  And so that's what the New York Times found out.
[00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:57.066]  They said, what a surprise!
[00:09:57.446 --> 00:09:58.107]  Surprisingly,
[00:09:58.707 --> 00:10:03.931]  One in five residents in this Howard County where they interviewed were born outside the country.
[00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:17.039]  Democrats outnumber Republicans there two to one, yet they voted against this sanctuary bill because it turns out the country's legal immigrants were not too keen on having an influx of illegal immigrants.
[00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:24.865]  They argued offering sanctuary to people who came to the country illegally devalued their own past struggles to gain citizenship.
[00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:25.785]  Boom!
[00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:26.386]  There you go.
[00:10:27.146 --> 00:10:52.209]  And just to kind of underscore how all of this travel ban nonsense and all the celebrities are in an uproar about it and it's super racist and xenophobic, just to underscore how it's totally politicized and if it was someone, say, Hillary Clinton who had been the president and enacted this law, well the ACLU lawyer actually says the travel ban could be constitutional if it was Hillary Clinton or someone else.
[00:10:53.010 --> 00:11:00.356]  And so this is a guy that argued against Trump's travel ban before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday.
[00:11:00.757 --> 00:11:06.462]  And he was trying to say that it was because Trump's campaign animus motivated the order, making it illegitimate.
[00:11:06.622 --> 00:11:12.567]  But if Hillary Clinton or someone else who wasn't racist, sexist, xenophobic wanted to do it, well, then it would be constitutional.
[00:11:12.947 --> 00:11:20.089]  There you know, it's totally political, which is why Sally Yates was a big joke, big nothing burger with her testimony on the Capitol Hill.
[00:11:20.189 --> 00:11:25.871]  Everyone could see it's all very political there, as again, no evidence found.
[00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:33.973]  So now we're kind of turning a lot of talk to the carbon taxes, the Paris Treaty.
[00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:35.273]  Will Trump stay in it?
[00:11:35.313 --> 00:11:37.014]  Will Ivanka convince him to stay in it?
[00:11:37.774 --> 00:11:43.537]  Well, Al Gore has put out his $15 trillion carbon tax document.
[00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:52.183]  It's newly created by his Energy Transitions Commission, and it's the plan to decarbonize the world's energy system.
[00:11:52.823 --> 00:12:01.308]  And it's basically the exact same information, the exact same views that Al Gore has been pumping out since 1992.
[00:12:01.668 --> 00:12:04.310]  He hasn't upgraded his inconvenient truth.
[00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.073]  Even though it inconveniently turned out to be not true for him.
[00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:13.195]  Very anti-human policies being put out there.
[00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:24.442]  But the core of it is recommending a massive punishing carbon tax that would destroy the market for continued robust development of the world's fossil fuel base.
[00:12:24.522 --> 00:12:25.242]  Very good there.
[00:12:25.322 --> 00:12:26.343]  Hasn't learned anything.
[00:12:26.443 --> 00:12:30.085]  We can see worldwide laws to tackle climate change exceed 1200.
[00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:30.745]  This is up from 60.
[00:12:33.447 --> 00:12:34.988]  Just a decade or so ago.
[00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:37.569]  So just more laws, more regulations.
[00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:48.115]  Oh, but trying to control that is almost as ridiculous as Vladimir Putin trying to control the weather so it did not rain on his military parade.
[00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:49.175]  That is right.
[00:12:49.415 --> 00:12:50.856]  Putin spent 1.3 million pounds
[00:12:54.338 --> 00:12:59.561]  To spike clouds with chemicals to guarantee sunshine on his big day.
[00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:04.003]  He put a chemical cocktail, he blasted it in the clouds, supposedly guaranteeing sunshine.
[00:13:04.023 --> 00:13:13.509]  It didn't rain, but there was no sunshine, and so they had to ground 72 aircraft Red Square Flypass.
[00:13:13.549 --> 00:13:16.610]  That flyover was grounded because there was clouds over the Kremlin.
[00:13:17.091 --> 00:13:19.692]  So there you go, this weather modification.
[00:13:19.752 --> 00:13:20.432]  It's not at 100% yet.
[00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:23.074]  But that's how ridiculous this is.
[00:13:23.114 --> 00:13:25.356]  Let's control the weather by taxing the people.
[00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:28.618]  Here's something totally unexpected.
[00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:36.905]  Scientists found a source of climate cooling in a place where we're being told is causing massive global warming.
[00:13:37.325 --> 00:13:38.806]  So these are Arctic waters.
[00:13:38.906 --> 00:13:44.951]  They have actually absorbed vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, creating a cooling effect
[00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:52.235]  230 times greater than the warming from the methane that's admitted from underwater seeps.
[00:13:52.575 --> 00:13:58.918]  This is according to a new study, so now they're going to have to go around the world and see if they can duplicate these findings in other areas.
[00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:07.443]  But again, they say it's totally unexpected, and it goes against the agenda of what we're being told by all of these climate scientists who say the science is settled.
[00:14:07.923 --> 00:14:09.304]  The science is not settled!
[00:14:10.084 --> 00:14:18.327]  And this is why you have to worry about things like colleges in California, for instance, destroying books after digitization.
[00:14:18.787 --> 00:14:20.768]  They say, you know, well, it's all digitized now.
[00:14:20.788 --> 00:14:21.969]  It's going to save us space.
[00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:30.372]  Sixty percent of the books at the library there at UC Berkeley in particular were destroyed after they digitized them.
[00:14:30.852 --> 00:14:38.475]  And this is sparking 1984 type fears, style censorship, because the original sources were destroyed.
[00:14:38.635 --> 00:14:40.817]  Just like in 1984, where guess what?
[00:14:41.097 --> 00:14:57.709]  Just like they edited out the segment of the Bill Nye episode where he talks about chromosomes determining your gender, well that's how some SJW can get in there and totally rewrite history, just like Google even rewrote the definition of fascism on their website.
[00:14:58.329 --> 00:15:00.551]  And there you go, that's some fake news.
[00:15:00.871 --> 00:15:05.915]  Paul Joseph Watson actually has a report for the biggest arbiter of fake news out there, BuzzFeed.
[00:15:07.096 --> 00:15:12.906]  BuzzFeed is once again pushing race-baiting divisive crap and casual anti-white racism.
[00:15:16.687 --> 00:15:21.750]  So a dude on Twitter reacted to Netflix's Dear White People show with the following tweet.
[00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.791]  Imagine if there was a show called Dear Black People.
[00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:32.616]  Then this black dude called Reggie responded to that tweet with... Dear Black People, I'm sorry for our history of oppression and genocide.
[00:15:32.676 --> 00:15:37.459]  This was such epic onage that BuzzFeed devoted an entire article to it.
[00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:40.341]  Yeah, Reggie sure showed him right.
[00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:46.820]  Dear black people, I'm sorry your skin color makes me see you as a threat.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:57.644]  Yeah, that probably has more to do with the fact that black people are way over-represented in violent crime statistics and commit about half of homicides in America despite being only 13% of the population.
[00:15:57.684 --> 00:15:58.184]  Just saying.
[00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:11.229]  So Reggie told BuzzFeed... I was trying to help them understand how the history of this country shaped racism to only go one way and that the double standard lacks historical context.
[00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:11.609]  Right.
[00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:14.532]  So you want to talk about historical context?
[00:16:15.172 --> 00:16:15.533]  Okay!
[00:16:15.613 --> 00:16:26.103]  The very word slave is derived from Slav, Slavic white people who were taken as slaves by Muslims in Spain in the 9th century.
[00:16:26.143 --> 00:16:34.851]  For hundreds of years under the Barbary slave trade, over a million white Christian Europeans were abducted by Arabs.
[00:16:34.891 --> 00:16:35.192]  That's
[00:16:35.572 --> 00:16:38.354]  White people being enslaved by brown people.
[00:16:38.394 --> 00:16:43.676]  The Barbary slave trade was far more brutal than the transatlantic slave trade.
[00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:49.900]  Arabs also enslaved blacks and castrated young black boys so they couldn't have children.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.522]  Killing many of them in the process of amputating their scrotum and penis.
[00:16:54.782 --> 00:17:01.906]  Oh, but I don't see Buzzfeed or Reggie b******g and blaming Arabs living today for what their ancestors did hundreds of years ago.
[00:17:01.986 --> 00:17:06.089]  White people were the first in the world to legally end slavery.
[00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:10.151]  Reformers like William Wilberforce who campaigned for the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833.
[00:17:11.732 --> 00:17:20.587]  White people also literally put their lives on the line to conduct raids in African countries to free black slaves from their Arab captors.
[00:17:20.687 --> 00:17:26.937]  Hundreds of thousands of white Americans died in a civil war partly to end slavery.
[00:17:26.997 --> 00:17:28.978]  There's your historical context.
[00:17:29.038 --> 00:17:33.760]  There are still 46 million people enslaved in the world today.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.981]  The most ever in human history.
[00:17:37.021 --> 00:17:42.024]  They're enslaved in countries like India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan and Qatar.
[00:17:42.084 --> 00:17:45.025]  Yeah, you'll notice none of those are white countries.
[00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:49.507]  There are also millions of black people still enslaved in Africa.
[00:17:49.687 --> 00:17:52.228]  You don't give a damn about that, do you BuzzFeed?
[00:17:52.288 --> 00:18:00.970]  Listen, virtually every single racial group in history has been guilty of enslaving people from other racial groups or social castes.
[00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:10.573]  The contemporary narrative that only white people are to blame for slavery is not only totally historically inaccurate, it's also racist.
[00:18:10.713 --> 00:18:16.414]  Which is why BuzzFeed and a myriad of other leftist outlets and institutions push it.
[00:18:16.774 --> 00:18:18.595]  Because they're racist.
[00:18:18.735 --> 00:18:20.619]  But reverse racism doesn't exist!
[00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:21.842]  Institutional power!
[00:18:23.447 --> 00:18:31.473]  The major institutions of media and cultural power in the West are almost completely dominated and controlled by the left.
[00:18:31.613 --> 00:18:37.397]  The same left using institutional power to push anti-white racism.
[00:18:37.517 --> 00:18:46.043]  Emboldening actual white supremacists and black supremacists and causing more racial tension.
[00:18:46.143 --> 00:18:46.644]  Stop!
[00:18:46.964 --> 00:18:50.907]  Stop lecturing everyone about historical context.
[00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:58.581]  When you have no frigging idea whatsoever about the true historical context of slavery.
[00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:09.358]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:09.578 --> 00:19:16.004]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:19:16.245 --> 00:19:24.513]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:33.538]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:39.541]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:40.362]  It works.
[00:19:40.642 --> 00:19:48.949]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:19:49.109 --> 00:19:58.516]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the Globalists all at the same time.
[00:19:58.857 --> 00:19:59.357]  A total 360 win.
[00:20:01.448 --> 00:20:03.209]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman.
[00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:05.290]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.751]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, oh, I don't know about this one.
[00:20:09.212 --> 00:20:12.193]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[00:20:12.213 --> 00:20:12.793]  I'm 42.
[00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:15.715]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:17.356]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:20:19.296 --> 00:20:20.437]  No, I'm not.
[00:20:20.457 --> 00:20:21.117]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:21.718]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:28.961]  But, the point is, is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:36.785]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula, has just worked magic for me.
[00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:40.286]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[00:20:41.687 --> 00:20:46.933]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:20:46.973 --> 00:20:50.056]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:51.758]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:20:52.118 --> 00:20:53.320]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.541]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:20:54.561 --> 00:21:01.729]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:04.091]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:10.057]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:21:10.077 --> 00:21:11.678]  I felt it immediately.
[00:21:11.898 --> 00:21:13.920]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.083]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[00:21:17.103 --> 00:21:18.264]  It tastes good to me.
[00:21:18.344 --> 00:21:22.288]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:21:22.328 --> 00:21:24.390]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[00:21:27.072 --> 00:21:28.153]  Bone broth!
[00:21:28.213 --> 00:21:33.356]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known, because it tastes really good.
[00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:37.118]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:21:37.158 --> 00:21:44.922]  So, ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already, because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:21:44.982 --> 00:21:50.045]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my... Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[00:21:50.866 --> 00:21:58.481]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street, and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action, no fear, nothing, so...
[00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:06.486]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:22:07.027 --> 00:22:08.848]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:22:09.569 --> 00:22:20.117]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go onto our store and donate.
[00:22:20.177 --> 00:22:21.418]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:22:21.478 --> 00:22:27.562]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:22:28.803 --> 00:22:31.065]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:33.307]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:41.413]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:44.776]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:22:44.816 --> 00:22:47.658]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:22:47.758 --> 00:22:53.143]  So once again, we've got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us and
[00:22:53.843 --> 00:23:00.690]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[00:23:06.923 --> 00:23:10.465]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're watching the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:23:10.905 --> 00:23:28.636]  Well, California universities have been removing and destroying library books, apparently after digitizing them, which some critics actually do warn that this could lead to a 1984-style censorship, which it makes sense.
[00:23:28.736 --> 00:23:32.699]  I mean, critics out there are saying we could be moving into a digital
[00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:34.180]  Dark Age.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.761]  Well, how could this happen?
[00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:55.534]  People are getting rid of hard copies, just like we've seen with Blockbuster, for example, or some of these other old video rental stores used to be able to go in and have this massive selection of different videos to choose from, to watch, and to have as a, you know, a point of history.
[00:23:56.494 --> 00:24:08.585]  And now all of those hard copies have kind of been done away with and we just see you know online movie watching or those little red box movie watching stations which has a very limited selection.
[00:24:09.006 --> 00:24:10.908]  Even on Netflix and some of these other
[00:24:11.668 --> 00:24:16.170]  Online movie watching platforms, they have such a limited selection.
[00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:21.113]  It's not anywhere as near as vast as those original video rental stores.
[00:24:21.353 --> 00:24:33.559]  So now we're seeing that with these universities, they're getting rid of hard physical copies of library books and trusting that the library staff and students are going to correctly
[00:24:34.219 --> 00:24:37.281]  Transfer them into digital copies!
[00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:50.971]  Do you think we should actually be trusting SJWs and their liberal and Marxist professors to properly transfer the correct interpretations of these books into digital copies?
[00:24:52.092 --> 00:25:02.059]  Well, apparently UC Berkeley, which we all remember, UC Berkeley has a big problem with conservative speakers coming and speaking there.
[00:25:02.139 --> 00:25:14.468]  It is a massive anti-fa hub where you have anti-fa and SJWs alike calling for censorship, calling for an end of free speech, and calling for the removal of hate speech.
[00:25:15.288 --> 00:25:36.062]  So, UC Berkeley has apparently removed over 135,000 books from its library and they claim to have digitized these books and they're saying that the extra space in the library can now be used as meeting rooms and nap pods.
[00:25:37.063 --> 00:25:45.706]  Okay, so college students need to have meeting rooms so they can meet about talking about their safe spaces and nap pods.
[00:25:46.066 --> 00:25:51.548]  I mean, are they going to turn these libraries into safe spaces now instead of places of study?
[00:25:51.588 --> 00:25:55.210]  It's going to be where everyone can go have a nap in a bottle and a blankie.
[00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.250]  I mean, what are we?
[00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.891]  I mean, is this not arrested development?
[00:25:59.371 --> 00:26:01.092]  It's pretty disturbing.
[00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:15.206]  But you know, they're saying that they've removed over 60% of the physical collection at the Science Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
[00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:23.654]  And this has caused an uproar after it was reported that many of the books removed had been completely destroyed.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.026]  So we're essentially seeing book burning in our modern times.
[00:26:29.126 --> 00:26:34.715]  I mean, that is pretty alarming that we're now seeing book burning and it's probably an indicator that
[00:26:35.737 --> 00:26:37.038]  Something's just not right.
[00:26:37.198 --> 00:27:00.396]  And like I've said before, there's so much evidence out there that we have these liberal professors at universities and Marxist professors at universities indoctrinating these college kids with this whole SJW propaganda, ring-a-maror, and now you have kids calling for the end of free speech.
[00:27:01.798 --> 00:27:16.253]  it's it's this goes right along with it book burning or just transferring it to digital copies now some of the problems with transferring to digital copies are you know that basically what they're worrying about is
[00:27:18.855 --> 00:27:26.300]  These digital copies will eventually be lost due to lack of compatibility with formats.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:45.012]  So what they're saying is there's already been a huge problem with e-books and e-books has already lost a lot of their different books because the old formats of documents that were created are no longer usable and compatible or readable with their software.
[00:27:45.672 --> 00:28:03.925]  And so what they're saying that can happen is that over time, even if we accumulate vast archives of digital content, we may actually not even know what it is because we won't even be able to open the files because we won't have something that's compatible.
[00:28:04.865 --> 00:28:08.868]  In a sense, it's for example, it's like getting rid of all VCRs.
[00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:11.171]  I think so.
[00:28:32.008 --> 00:28:44.274]  A hard device such as a VCR player, a DVD player, where people can then just switch it on to the next hard format, when we have software that's constantly updating, it's going to get a lot more tricky.
[00:28:44.915 --> 00:28:52.019]  So another thing that's interesting is this comes around the same time that Bill Nye the Science Guy, I mean this was
[00:28:52.719 --> 00:29:00.188]  This was last week, just when Bill Nye, his little segments when I remember him in school, he was the cool science guy.
[00:29:00.228 --> 00:29:02.211]  Well now he's Mr. Propaganda.
[00:29:02.271 --> 00:29:04.233]  He's Bill Nye the Propaganda Sky.
[00:29:04.814 --> 00:29:06.636]  And Netflix has edited out...
[00:29:08.058 --> 00:29:16.841]  The part in one of his old segments where he taught about chromosomes and how they determined your sex, whether you were going to be a boy or a girl.
[00:29:17.301 --> 00:29:22.602]  So now Netflix puts up that same episode, but they edited out that small part.
[00:29:23.202 --> 00:29:23.503]  Why?
[00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:26.483]  Because it didn't go along with their agenda.
[00:29:26.523 --> 00:29:34.866]  It didn't go along with their new idea that they're trying to push where there's no such thing as gender being backed by science as
[00:29:35.686 --> 00:29:38.088]  You know, boy and girl, that there's two genders.
[00:29:38.629 --> 00:29:43.934]  So now, we're seeing it right now where we see, okay, so they just added that little blurb out, and...
[00:29:46.033 --> 00:29:53.516]  If people just completely get rid of old versions of it, old copies of it, then all the future generations will know it's just that video.
[00:29:54.077 --> 00:30:04.461]  And when you have people out there pushing propaganda that there's more than two genders, well then next thing you know, that's going to be the common theme.
[00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:06.783]  That's going to be what everybody accepts to be true.
[00:30:06.823 --> 00:30:07.823]  It'll be common knowledge.
[00:30:08.283 --> 00:30:13.085]  Another thing that's kind of interesting is Google definitions.
[00:30:13.205 --> 00:30:13.446]  I mean,
[00:30:14.887 --> 00:30:31.397]  I'm sure that a lot of these books that were destroyed at these public libraries were definitions, because we use definitions as primary principles and our words as primary principles, such as the definition of gender.
[00:30:32.558 --> 00:30:53.051]  If our original definition from, let's say, the 1940s or 50s of gender was that it's basically a girl or a boy defining a male or a female and identifying that there are two different genders between all species and humans,
[00:30:53.951 --> 00:31:02.720]  Then they would want to get rid of that dictionary, those old dictionaries, because now on Google, Google can just update the definitions.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.903]  So this is kind of interesting here.
[00:31:05.923 --> 00:31:16.653]  I saw this definition here with a simple Google search and they've updated on dictionary.com the definition.
[00:31:17.968 --> 00:31:35.853]  And I mean, okay, so they've added in a second definition here where it says, a similar category of human beings that is outside the male-female binary classification and is based on the individual's personal awareness or identity.
[00:31:36.693 --> 00:31:40.314]  Now, I'm sure that dictionaries
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:49.143]  A couple decades ago did not include gender to have anything to do with somebody's personal identity.
[00:31:49.723 --> 00:31:50.043]  Okay?
[00:31:51.044 --> 00:31:52.244]  It probably did not.
[00:31:52.344 --> 00:31:54.485]  Neither did either of the sexes.
[00:31:55.565 --> 00:31:57.526]  And another interesting one is fascism.
[00:31:57.686 --> 00:32:01.888]  I mean, the redefining fascism, if you just Google search fascism,
[00:32:02.768 --> 00:32:19.858]  You'll see that they've kind of lumped fascism into this definition, including alt-right and right-wing and all this stuff, but they leave out important details regarding the structure of a fascist government.
[00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:24.148]  Involving corporate relationships with the government.
[00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:31.935]  Because in Spain, for example, they actually had a fascist revolution in Spain and it was leftists.
[00:32:32.376 --> 00:32:34.177]  It was left fascism.
[00:32:34.297 --> 00:32:35.078]  Isn't that bizarre?
[00:32:35.358 --> 00:32:39.062]  You can actually have leftists pushing fascism.
[00:32:39.502 --> 00:32:44.066]  Which is kind of interesting when you see these Antifa out there pushing
[00:32:44.727 --> 00:32:50.033]  For the end of free speech, for censorship, but you know I guess that's a communist principle as well.
[00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:56.860]  It's very alarming and we very well could be entering into a digital dark age.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.343]  This is Millie Weaver signing off for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:02.648 --> 00:33:03.989]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:05.010]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.592]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.892 --> 00:33:07.713]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.853 --> 00:33:08.634]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.034 --> 00:33:11.236]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.437 --> 00:33:13.158]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.178 --> 00:33:16.762]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:17.002 --> 00:33:17.462]  MycoCX.
[00:33:18.183 --> 00:33:18.803]  We're good to go.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:49.044]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.084 --> 00:33:49.644]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.925 --> 00:33:53.827]  So, we've been doing research just like you have on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.088 --> 00:34:01.453]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... And we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.054 --> 00:34:04.656]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:13.203]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.223 --> 00:34:16.145]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.185 --> 00:34:18.607]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.627 --> 00:34:20.329]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:27.912]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.393 --> 00:34:37.197]  I've had nobody, here's the thing Alex, when you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.757 --> 00:34:40.679]  It's going to show, you're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.759 --> 00:34:45.402]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.423 --> 00:34:45.883]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.103 --> 00:34:46.843]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.904 --> 00:34:48.124]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.164 --> 00:34:48.705]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.725 --> 00:34:49.866]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.186 --> 00:34:51.887]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.708 --> 00:34:54.689]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:56.230]  Yeast overgrowth.
[00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.933]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.973 --> 00:35:05.597]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.357 --> 00:35:07.218]  What doctor?
[00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.380]  By the way, folks, look, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.601 --> 00:35:11.162]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.223 --> 00:35:12.724]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.005 --> 00:35:14.606]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.726 --> 00:35:15.728]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.388 --> 00:35:17.930]  Listen, this is religious for me.
[00:35:19.432 --> 00:35:21.975]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe it.
[00:35:23.078 --> 00:35:26.761]  If we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:28.763]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.863 --> 00:35:29.904]  I'm ready to give my life.
[00:35:29.924 --> 00:35:31.085]  Everybody knows that against the enemy.
[00:35:31.606 --> 00:35:32.066]  Please.
[00:35:32.907 --> 00:35:34.328]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.768 --> 00:35:35.469]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:36.290]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.210]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:42.235]  MycoZX antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.

[00:35:47.399 --> 00:35:48.899]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.919 --> 00:35:50.860]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.945 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great!
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.526 --> 00:36:14.688]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:14.708 --> 00:36:15.108]  Thank you.
[00:36:15.128 --> 00:36:24.132]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swirl, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.152 --> 00:36:24.893]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:24.913 --> 00:36:27.474]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.554 --> 00:36:29.135]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[00:36:29.395 --> 00:36:32.717]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.837 --> 00:36:33.217]  That's amazing.
[00:36:33.237 --> 00:36:33.898]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.118 --> 00:36:37.160]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.441]  Like, I haven't felt asleep.
[00:36:38.541 --> 00:36:40.122]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:36:40.202 --> 00:36:41.322]  And I love you guys.
[00:36:41.342 --> 00:36:42.863]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:36:43.604 --> 00:36:50.308]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.468 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.969]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:58.017]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.057 --> 00:36:58.798]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.939 --> 00:36:59.900]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:04.738 --> 00:37:10.842]  This is a story about the political process, about gun owners being shot in the back by gun manufacturers.
[00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:16.606]  But it's also a story about the connection to the other prohibition, the war on drugs.
[00:37:16.726 --> 00:37:22.110]  The war on drugs is turning into a literal war on our streets, just as we've seen in other countries, like Mexico.
[00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:27.933]  We're now having a literal war on the streets, but it is also tied to our foreign wars.
[00:37:27.974 --> 00:37:34.238]  We've talked many times about Afghanistan and the rapid increase in opium production there.
[00:37:34.978 --> 00:37:41.464]  And now it looks like there may be a connection, not only to our past and current wars, but also to our future wars.
[00:37:41.524 --> 00:37:47.369]  It looks like there may be a connection with opium and our future war with North Korea that they're talking about.
[00:37:47.409 --> 00:37:50.611]  But let's take a look first at the war on our streets.
[00:37:50.832 --> 00:37:54.194]  Chicago logs its 200th homicide of the year.
[00:37:54.995 --> 00:37:58.817]  As they say in the Chicago Tribune, the people who are victims of this says it has to stop.
[00:37:58.837 --> 00:38:00.578]  But it isn't going to stop, and we'll tell you why.
[00:38:01.298 --> 00:38:08.361]  The city reached this grim milestone of 200 casualties just four days later than last year, which was the most violent in decades.
[00:38:08.741 --> 00:38:18.646]  And as of Monday, at least 1,114 people have been shot in Chicago this year, compared with 1,239 this time last year, according to the Chicago Tribune.
[00:38:19.366 --> 00:38:20.947]  I've talked about this last week.
[00:38:21.487 --> 00:38:23.308]  There's an article from the New American.
[00:38:23.808 --> 00:38:26.569]  John Lott points out that half of all U.S.
[00:38:26.669 --> 00:38:30.911]  murders happen in only 2% of the counties in the United States.
[00:38:31.271 --> 00:38:33.592]  And guess which 2% those are?
[00:38:34.072 --> 00:38:36.513]  It's not the places where people own the most guns.
[00:38:36.613 --> 00:38:39.274]  It's the places where you have the most gun control.
[00:38:39.394 --> 00:38:40.815]  It does exactly the opposite.
[00:38:40.835 --> 00:38:41.335]  And we know that.
[00:38:41.775 --> 00:38:42.635]  We've seen that many times.
[00:38:42.675 --> 00:38:48.579]  In 2014, the latest year for which they have data available, half of all murders in the U.S.
[00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:50.640]  took place in only 63 U.S.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.160]  counties.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.742]  That's 2% of the counties in the country.
[00:38:54.822 --> 00:38:58.123]  Two-thirds of all murder last year happened in only 157 counties.
[00:38:58.143 --> 00:38:58.544]  That's just 5%.
[00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:10.653]  Anti-gun politicians, as he points out in the New American article, often use the United States' overall violent crime rates as an excuse to impose more gun laws on the populace.
[00:39:10.673 --> 00:39:12.955]  But when you look at the worst 5% of U.S.
[00:39:13.015 --> 00:39:18.740]  counties and you remove them from the equation, the nation's overall murder rate drops from 4.4 per 100,000 from 4.4 to 2.5.
[00:39:24.414 --> 00:39:25.394]  Drops almost in half.
[00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:30.976]  He also noted further in the study that it's the urban areas that have low gun ownership among the citizenry.
[00:39:31.596 --> 00:39:39.118]  They experience much higher murder rates, while so much of the country that has very high gun ownership rates has zero murders.
[00:39:39.178 --> 00:39:41.879]  And he concludes, murder isn't a nationwide problem.
[00:39:42.259 --> 00:39:45.219]  It's a problem in a very small set of urban areas.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:50.621]  Now, we're talking about Chicago, of course, but you know, it doesn't even have the highest homicide rate.
[00:39:51.201 --> 00:39:52.062]  Actually, St.
[00:39:52.102 --> 00:39:57.388]  Louis has 59 people killed by guns per 100,000 population.
[00:39:57.689 --> 00:39:59.291]  In Chicago, it's 27.
[00:40:00.072 --> 00:40:00.973]  So, St.
[00:40:00.993 --> 00:40:02.595]  Louis is almost double the rate.
[00:40:02.695 --> 00:40:06.279]  And there's other cities that are much higher than Chicago in terms of a rate.
[00:40:06.699 --> 00:40:08.481]  Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Newark.
[00:40:09.144 --> 00:40:09.584]  We're good to go.
[00:40:28.954 --> 00:40:33.357]  As we see what's happening in Chicago, it's really focused around the gangs.
[00:40:33.417 --> 00:40:35.799]  And that's where the war on drugs comes into play.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.601]  And it's stepping up to a new level.
[00:40:37.621 --> 00:40:39.882]  As we saw today on the Drudge Report, there were several articles.
[00:40:39.902 --> 00:40:45.987]  The Wall Street Journal is saying the Chicago police are warning officers of assault-style weapons threat.
[00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:49.830]  And of course, assault-style weapons, that just means anything that looks scary to them.
[00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:57.755]  But they're also looking at armor, piercing ammunition that could be used that would pierce body armor.
[00:40:58.636 --> 00:41:00.277]  And here's the situation with Chicago.
[00:41:01.178 --> 00:41:04.759]  The problem in Chicago is not just that you've got people shooting each other.
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.120]  Gangs are shooting each other.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.542]  It's the most gang-infested city in the United States.
[00:41:08.842 --> 00:41:11.863]  They have 60 gangs just in Chicago alone.
[00:41:12.364 --> 00:41:15.806]  About 100,000 people are members of those gangs.
[00:41:16.126 --> 00:41:18.907]  61% of the homicides in 2011 were from gang members.
[00:41:18.927 --> 00:41:22.309]  80% of the violent crime was from gang members.
[00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:25.451]  So they're warning people about what's going on with that.
[00:41:25.531 --> 00:41:26.692]  And yet, at the same time,
[00:41:27.412 --> 00:41:36.976]  We see that Chicago and Illinois in general is one of the strictest places in terms of trying to take guns out of the hands of citizens, even as we see this explosion.
[00:41:37.276 --> 00:41:41.178]  There's two types of prohibition, and they really feed on each other in many ways.
[00:41:41.218 --> 00:41:48.922]  But I want to go to this first thing I talked about, the fact that gun owners in Illinois have just been shot in the back by gun manufacturers in Illinois.
[00:41:49.542 --> 00:41:51.983]  The gun community has been talking about this for a week.
[00:41:52.203 --> 00:42:05.728]  The fact that we have two gun manufacturers, Springfield Armory and Rock River Arms in Illinois, they trade their opposition to new restrictions on the trade of firearms so that they can get a carve-out for themselves.
[00:42:05.768 --> 00:42:07.529]  This is the truth about guns, pointing this out.
[00:42:07.869 --> 00:42:09.310]  And of course, this is the Illinois Senate
[00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:24.688]  Last, at the end of April, passing by one vote margin the idea that they're going to mandate federal firearms licenses for everyone who sells more than nine weapons in a year, except for the two manufacturers.
[00:42:25.089 --> 00:42:27.792]  And of course, this is an effort to shut down gun shows.
[00:42:28.493 --> 00:42:32.896]  Now, what happened was, there was a lobbyist for the Illinois Firearms Manufacturers Association.
[00:42:33.316 --> 00:42:34.877]  This guy's name is Jay Keller.
[00:42:34.937 --> 00:42:44.384]  He traded a group's opposition to the bill in exchange for a carve-out that removed them from the licensing requirements, or removed those manufacturers from the licensing requirement.
[00:42:44.784 --> 00:42:47.426]  Well, guess who the Illinois Firearms Manufacturers are?
[00:42:48.006 --> 00:42:50.128]  It's just those two companies.
[00:42:50.708 --> 00:42:51.529]  Just those two companies.
[00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:55.932]  And what they said was they opposed it, and they went from opposing it to neutral.
[00:42:56.392 --> 00:42:58.173]  And then it passed by one vote in the Senate.
[00:42:58.193 --> 00:43:00.414]  So we'll have to see what happens with the rest of the legislation.
[00:43:01.115 --> 00:43:02.956]  But a lot of people got very upset about that.
[00:43:02.996 --> 00:43:10.381]  And so in response, you had Rock River Arms say, we are no longer part of the Illinois Firearms Manufacturers Association.
[00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:13.703]  So I looked this up to say, well, how many other manufacturers are there in this?
[00:43:14.063 --> 00:43:15.304]  Well, it turns out there's just two.
[00:43:16.084 --> 00:43:23.866]  So they're one of the two organizations, Springfield Armory and Rock River Arms, created the Illinois Firearms Manufacturers Association to lobby people.
[00:43:24.227 --> 00:43:33.449]  Then they said, we had no idea this guy was paying off legislators to get us a carve-out, a special carve-out, so that we could throw the rest of you under the bus.
[00:43:33.729 --> 00:43:35.970]  And so we have now removed ourselves from this.
[00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:40.051]  And if you go back and you look at their filings here, you'll see if you go back to 2012,
[00:43:41.974 --> 00:43:45.077]  The public filing shows that we have five people involved.
[00:43:45.117 --> 00:43:49.180]  President, Secretary, Vice President, Treasurer, and the Executive Director.
[00:43:49.221 --> 00:43:52.844]  The only person who got paid was the Executive Director, that's the lobbyist, Jay Keller.
[00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:55.246]  He was paid $50,000 a year that year.
[00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.188]  And the other four people there
[00:43:57.688 --> 00:44:00.610]  Two of them are brothers who ran the Springfield Armory.
[00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.431]  The other two are brothers who ran Rock River Arms.
[00:44:03.511 --> 00:44:05.672]  One of those brothers has subsequently died.
[00:44:06.013 --> 00:44:10.295]  But still, the two companies are the sole owners of this organization.
[00:44:10.715 --> 00:44:12.616]  They carve out an exemption for themselves.
[00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:15.017]  They throw the rest of the people under the bus.
[00:44:15.058 --> 00:44:17.599]  And it reminds me of what Vladimir Lenin said.
[00:44:17.619 --> 00:44:21.501]  He said, capitalists will sell us the rope that is used to hang them.
[00:44:22.402 --> 00:44:22.882]  These people
[00:44:23.888 --> 00:44:26.930]  Basically hanging the gun owners who buy their products.
[00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:39.197]  It's absolutely amazing to me to see this happening and yet they plead that they have no idea that this is being done in their name and one of the two manufacturers has now come out of the Illinois Firearms Manufacturers Association.
[00:44:39.758 --> 00:44:41.138]  But where is this all leading?
[00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:49.183]  Of course we have talked many times about the war on drugs and the connection with the CIA and with our foreign wars in Afghanistan.
[00:44:49.363 --> 00:44:51.885]  A good example, this is what happened in Afghanistan of course.
[00:44:52.025 --> 00:44:54.186]  We know that after 9-11, the U.S.
[00:44:54.246 --> 00:44:57.688]  moved in and opium production skyrocketed there.
[00:44:58.189 --> 00:45:03.932]  The Taliban had been putting it in the crosshairs, and they had reduced it significantly before we went in there.
[00:45:04.052 --> 00:45:09.335]  After we went in, we saw it went from 75% of the world's supply of heroin to 90%.
[00:45:10.516 --> 00:45:14.358]  As a matter of fact, if you look at their production level, it was 185 tons of opium
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.440]  I think so.
[00:45:43.348 --> 00:45:44.949]  But it's the conservative press as well.
[00:45:44.989 --> 00:45:47.952]  Judicial Watch is talking about $8.5 billion U.S.
[00:45:48.012 --> 00:45:51.835]  counter-narcotics effort in Afghanistan actually boosts opium production.
[00:45:52.215 --> 00:45:54.037]  They say this is a humiliating failure.
[00:45:54.417 --> 00:45:57.419]  No, it's precisely what they wanted to see happen.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.061]  They say opium production rose 43% to 4,800 tons.
[00:46:00.082 --> 00:46:01.943]  That's 4,800 tons now in the latest year.
[00:46:01.963 --> 00:46:02.824]  A 10% increase in one year alone.
[00:46:08.268 --> 00:46:13.151]  And we have spent 8.5 billion dollars trying to control it.
[00:46:13.691 --> 00:46:16.092]  No, actually, we're trying to control it for the CIA.
[00:46:16.352 --> 00:46:18.874]  And the question is, will this happen in North Korea?
[00:46:19.654 --> 00:46:21.395]  North Korea is now starving for money.
[00:46:21.895 --> 00:46:25.817]  China, in response to pressure and sanctions, has stopped buying their coal.
[00:46:26.238 --> 00:46:27.799]  North Korea was producing opium.
[00:46:28.019 --> 00:46:30.320]  They have now stepped up their opium production.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.722]  Is this something we're going to see the United States do?
[00:46:32.742 --> 00:46:40.967]  You understand the connection between taking our rights for our guns, taking our rights for our drugs, creating a war on our streets, and creating foreign wars?
[00:46:41.748 --> 00:46:42.528]  For the CIA.
[00:46:43.149 --> 00:46:43.749]  For the UN.
[00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:45.030]  For the globalists.
[00:46:46.071 --> 00:46:47.552]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:07.775]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.435 --> 00:47:10.016]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.416 --> 00:47:15.419]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.759 --> 00:47:21.223]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.603 --> 00:47:28.207]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.847 --> 00:47:29.988]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:32.790]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.072]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.492 --> 00:47:40.115]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.315 --> 00:47:42.877]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.917 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.487 --> 00:48:00.611]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.233]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.333 --> 00:48:03.334]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.754 --> 00:48:08.338]  I tried it, and I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.538 --> 00:48:13.462]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.943 --> 00:48:18.847]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.927 --> 00:48:20.068]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.228 --> 00:48:22.830]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:23.230]  Of course!
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.434]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.454 --> 00:48:49.476]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:50.517]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.557 --> 00:48:51.178]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.538 --> 00:48:59.088]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.108 --> 00:48:59.969]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.989 --> 00:49:00.029]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.453 --> 00:49:20.969]  A new twist in the Syria Civil War saga has happened today with a CNN story that has just come out, and of course, who other than Clarissa Ward is bringing it to us.
[00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.533]  Now, this is a story that kind of disappeared.
[00:49:24.174 --> 00:49:26.196]  Let's remember the Syrian gas attack.
[00:49:26.917 --> 00:49:28.378]  They blame the Assad regime.
[00:49:28.518 --> 00:49:30.379]  They say it's sarin gas.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.581]  All sorts of backlash.
[00:49:33.061 --> 00:49:34.422]  Putin says it's fake news.
[00:49:34.562 --> 00:49:35.923]  Assad says it's fake news.
[00:49:36.383 --> 00:49:46.129]  In the West, Donald Trump attacked Syrian air bases, allegedly the Assad air bases, that were carrying the chemical attacks that bombed these people.
[00:49:46.169 --> 00:49:50.492]  So, now this story comes out by Clarissa Ward, including a video.
[00:49:52.093 --> 00:49:56.116]  Now, this is interesting because this is probably the most intense
[00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:05.776]  War film that's ever been put out, at least recently with the Syrian gas attacks, as far as any media outlet is concerned.
[00:50:07.117 --> 00:50:21.348]  Now this is, they show kids dying, they show kids struggling for air, they have what is allegedly footage from exactly when the bombs hit the ground of journalists that were reporting, and then boom, all of a sudden bombs go off.
[00:50:21.948 --> 00:50:24.170]  So I'm trying to get, I'm trying to figure all of this out.
[00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:25.050]  Now see right here,
[00:50:25.971 --> 00:50:28.793]  This video right here shows that it's not sarin gas.
[00:50:28.813 --> 00:50:30.594]  You cannot treat sarin gas like that.
[00:50:31.234 --> 00:50:36.217]  And, of course, there's a doctor who's in this video who basically says that without saying that to you.
[00:50:36.798 --> 00:50:44.062]  And if you read the story, you'll notice that, at least in this article, they're kind of backing off the use of sarin gas.
[00:50:44.142 --> 00:50:45.783]  Now, they mention sarin gas.
[00:50:46.023 --> 00:50:50.126]  They mention Assad's gassing his people or using sarin gas in the past.
[00:50:50.646 --> 00:50:53.589]  But they don't really push that narrative as much in that story.
[00:50:53.849 --> 00:50:55.971]  I'm wondering if that's because it's been so debunked.
[00:50:56.972 --> 00:51:11.966]  Now, they are obviously demonizing Assad here, but again, it's interesting they're not pushing the narrative of that as much, and they're saying, witnesses say this, they're using different kind of nuancical language to get around
[00:51:13.382 --> 00:51:16.565]  Virtually saying Assad used gas on his own people.
[00:51:16.585 --> 00:51:36.981]  They're just kind of going around saying that now they are saying that he did that in 2013 They they will say that that's a fact no doubt in 2013 Assad used sarin gas on his own people They're still kind of tiptoeing around that while hinting at it in this story, but now showing you again probably the most graphic footage
[00:51:38.522 --> 00:51:44.850]  Involved with the gas attack on Syrians with this new exclusive report from CNN.
[00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:45.752]  Fake news, folks.
[00:51:45.792 --> 00:51:46.492]  Very fake news.
[00:51:46.533 --> 00:51:47.714]  Excuse me, let me correct myself.
[00:51:48.014 --> 00:51:48.375]  CNN.
[00:51:49.016 --> 00:51:50.938]  So I'm watching this and it's amazing to think.
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:53.642]  What am I really seeing here?
[00:51:54.583 --> 00:51:56.566]  There's so many different angles that this could be.
[00:51:57.603 --> 00:51:59.945]  Is this a terrorist attack?
[00:52:00.145 --> 00:52:02.326]  Who, obviously, I mean, did somebody attack here?
[00:52:02.366 --> 00:52:03.787]  Do you believe that this was a real attack?
[00:52:03.827 --> 00:52:05.008]  Are these people actually suffering?
[00:52:05.028 --> 00:52:05.928]  Was there a gas attack?
[00:52:06.188 --> 00:52:06.949]  What is going on here?
[00:52:07.229 --> 00:52:08.570]  Or is this totally staged?
[00:52:10.251 --> 00:52:13.233]  I mean, to say that sounds incredible, right?
[00:52:13.733 --> 00:52:19.617]  To believe that somebody would go through the length of staging all of this, all of this editing, all of this people, but guess what?
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.063]  The White Hats have been caught doing this in the past.
[00:52:23.143 --> 00:52:25.226]  We've seen videos, fake truck attacks.
[00:52:25.266 --> 00:52:30.171]  We've seen videos of when they say that bodies are dead and they're still moving and they're still breathing.
[00:52:30.211 --> 00:52:31.533]  So it's all very strange.
[00:52:31.713 --> 00:52:39.542]  And then of course you have CNN who will claim that they are being bombed in, you know, overseas in the Middle East when they're actually in a studio in Atlanta.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.841]  So I'm seeing all this and I'm trying to get some ground here.
[00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:44.582]  I'm trying to figure out what the heck is going on.
[00:52:45.082 --> 00:52:47.323]  Am I really to believe that all of this is an act?
[00:52:48.043 --> 00:52:49.684]  Or did somebody actually bomb these people?
[00:52:49.724 --> 00:52:50.604]  Are they actually suffering?
[00:52:50.925 --> 00:52:51.845]  What is going on here?
[00:52:52.405 --> 00:52:54.166]  And then all of a sudden I noticed something.
[00:52:54.666 --> 00:52:58.308]  When I started doing more research into this, I can't believe I hadn't noticed this in the past.
[00:52:58.348 --> 00:52:59.528]  Thank God other people's had.
[00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:04.311]  All of the video that were being shown comes from one group.
[00:53:04.711 --> 00:53:06.792]  The Aleppo Media Center.
[00:53:07.532 --> 00:53:11.956]  The same group is the one providing all of the footage for all of this stuff.
[00:53:12.357 --> 00:53:15.440]  Now, when you look into the Aleppo Media Center, that's what you find out.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:20.604]  And you find out that they were the ones that perpetrated the dusty Aleppo boy.
[00:53:21.886 --> 00:53:22.526]  False news.
[00:53:24.188 --> 00:53:25.569]  So it goes on in this article.
[00:53:25.629 --> 00:53:26.690]  Now here's the video.
[00:53:27.031 --> 00:53:30.934]  So this is a boy, again, from an attack in Aleppo.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.841]  It's all Assad's fault.
[00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:44.067]  This kid apparently has open wounds, he's suffering, he's bleeding, but they can just pick him up, carry him around, twist him around, and then put him on this chair, get ready for the photo shoot, get him lined up for the photos.
[00:53:44.407 --> 00:53:48.870]  So now he's lined up, he's got his photos, there you see his open wound, and now this guy's breaking it down in the video.
[00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:52.992]  And then the kid later is touching the open wound, kind of scratching it, like, what's going on?
[00:53:53.032 --> 00:53:54.293]  You wouldn't do that if you had an open wound.
[00:53:54.333 --> 00:53:57.054]  So again, you have to take all of this with a grain of salt.
[00:53:57.514 --> 00:53:59.916]  Is this the greatest war propaganda
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.280]  Perhaps ever?
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.021]  I mean, since what?
[00:54:04.121 --> 00:54:06.161]  Since the last sarin gas false flag?
[00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:07.101]  Since 9-11?
[00:54:07.121 --> 00:54:08.622]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:54:08.982 --> 00:54:14.883]  This is serious footage that CNN is putting out to demonize the Assad regime, saying it gasses its own people.
[00:54:15.143 --> 00:54:21.804]  But then you have to sit here and remember that Aleppo Media Center is the same people that provided the video of the news hoax that was the Aleppo boy.
[00:54:22.064 --> 00:54:23.605]  So we're going to stay tuned to that.
[00:54:24.125 --> 00:54:25.045]  In the meantime,
[00:54:25.945 --> 00:54:28.447]  You've got World War 3 building up right now.
[00:54:28.707 --> 00:54:31.710]  You've got North Korea says they're going to do another nuclear test.
[00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:32.471]  They're not afraid.
[00:54:32.511 --> 00:54:33.571]  They'll wipe the U.S.
[00:54:33.892 --> 00:54:35.033]  forces to ashes.
[00:54:35.393 --> 00:54:41.958]  And then you've got Anonymous posting a video saying, prepare for World War 3.
[00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:43.320]  So this is all going on.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:48.304]  And now John Bowne has a report about a possible North Korean EMP attack.
[00:54:50.023 --> 00:54:51.203]  An EMP attack.
[00:54:51.403 --> 00:55:02.205]  Just how vulnerable is the United States and what can we do to prevent the possibility of instantly plunging the engines of the 21st century into Stone Age chaos?
[00:55:02.545 --> 00:55:16.368]  We get hit by one of these EMPs or a sun, I guess a Carrington event, you're the expert, but I've had scientists call it, it will blow the electrical grid and put us back in the Stone Age and they know that and they know we've been hit before.
[00:55:16.888 --> 00:55:18.508]  We were an industrialized society
[00:55:19.068 --> 00:55:22.809]  And metal lining buildings, you name it, basically caught on fire.
[00:55:23.169 --> 00:55:25.470]  Describe that threat for people that aren't aware of it.
[00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:29.171]  Oh, it is unbelievable.
[00:55:29.231 --> 00:55:38.334]  They're predicting 90% of the Americans will die within the first year if the power grid goes out in total.
[00:55:38.954 --> 00:55:40.254]  This is not scary talk.
[00:55:40.314 --> 00:55:41.134]  This is real.
[00:55:41.334 --> 00:55:46.916]  This is a possibility that a rogue nation or any nation that has a nuke
[00:55:47.386 --> 00:55:56.554]  It has the capability of detonating it in our atmosphere, it creates gamma waves, and it literally fries the electrical grid, and we have no power.
[00:55:56.934 --> 00:56:04.100]  The sun can do the same thing if it's got a big enough X-flare that it emits, and we're not protected.
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:10.145]  Now, some states are starting to protect their own grid, so they may be self-contained.
[00:56:10.305 --> 00:56:11.666]  Texas is thinking about it.
[00:56:12.226 --> 00:56:15.229]  But in terms of the country in whole,
[00:56:15.925 --> 00:56:17.106]  We haven't done anything yet.
[00:56:17.306 --> 00:56:35.800]  You know, Dr. Peter Pry, who is the Director of Homeland Security for EMP, and I've had several discussions, and I was really pushing for a national act, something like the GRID Act, and he said, you know, Gary, they're not going to do it on a national basis, but they may do it on a statewide basis.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:42.464]  And David and I, you know, we live here in Texas, and I'm happy to say that Texas is actually doing something.
[00:56:42.784 --> 00:56:45.526]  And it's interesting because there's three grids in the country.
[00:56:46.307 --> 00:56:49.409]  Texas is the only state to have its own grid.
[00:56:49.529 --> 00:56:58.155]  Congress recently brought an exploratory panel together to glance at the precautions and immediate aftermath resulting from an EMP attack.
[00:56:58.255 --> 00:57:04.359]  But it turns out, for example, all the drugs we rely on for a wide range of things require refrigeration.
[00:57:05.526 --> 00:57:10.180]  And the minute you start knocking out the system, there's a cascade of consequences.
[00:57:10.622 --> 00:57:12.628]  And if somebody were to methodically come in here...
[00:57:13.655 --> 00:57:13.975]  Fine.
[00:57:14.195 --> 00:57:22.477]  I think there are as few as nine nodal points you could knock out that would have a catastrophic effect because they lead to a cascade of systems shutting down.
[00:57:23.137 --> 00:57:36.381]  If you then looked at the effect potentially of either a series of local EMP attacks or a high-altitude EMP attack, you're talking about a catastrophic event from which conceivably you couldn't recover for years.
[00:57:37.021 --> 00:57:48.407]  I think we're living through the most dangerous period of my lifetime for a number of reasons, but the vulnerability of our national electric power grid is among the most important.
[00:57:50.087 --> 00:57:55.870]  And we are collectively continuing to ignore or to take ineffective countermeasures to deal with it.
[00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:59.712]  The continuity of government plan appears to be the main objective.
[00:58:00.072 --> 00:58:03.093]  This shooting of the Transformers in Henrico, Virginia,
[00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:09.832]  Everybody with a rifle gets a veto on electricity.
[00:58:10.933 --> 00:58:13.736]  And it doesn't suit many people to have the lights go out.
[00:58:14.396 --> 00:58:15.977]  But enough people will say, you know what?
[00:58:16.458 --> 00:58:20.721]  I hate the people on the other side of the river, and if I blow up that transformer, their power goes down.
[00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:24.825]  The people on that side of the river are going to say, how come they still have their lights on?
[00:58:25.465 --> 00:58:27.006]  Transformers are so vulnerable.
[00:58:27.086 --> 00:58:28.728]  And the tit-for-tat spreads from there.
[00:58:30.199 --> 00:58:33.861]  At the end of the day, my biggest fear is the power goes down.
[00:58:34.221 --> 00:58:38.384]  How well would you be prepared if the lights went out and didn't come back on?
[00:58:38.604 --> 00:58:40.465]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:58:41.565 --> 00:58:42.926]  That's going to do it for the show tonight.
