[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:07.175]  We've got it.
[00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:11.559]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.244]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:27.313 --> 00:00:45.799]  Well, close to four weeks ago, the controlled corporate enemy media, the globalist media, came out and acted like it was the end of the world when President Trump decried the white supremacist, as well as the anti-f... thugs.
[00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:56.403]  And then three weeks later, he was totally vindicated when we saw all across the country them savagely beating and attacking innocent prayer vigils, free speech rallies,
[00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.833]  Land rights events, Second Amendment events, you name it.
[00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:11.020]  That blew up squarely in Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Water, Michael Moores, and other people's faces.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.647]  Now, they're acting like the Dreamer Act put in place by Obama, used to flood the United States with people,
[00:01:19.978 --> 00:01:29.606]  On average, 30 years of age, calling illegal aliens dreamers when they couldn't document when they actually got here.
[00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:32.288]  It's been used for massive fraud.
[00:01:32.288 --> 00:01:34.910]  That's what the facts show.
[00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:46.038]  The truth is Trump is planning to try to get reform in that makes it easier for people that have come here legally to get working permits and to be in the United States.
[00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:46.439]  And I've got
[00:01:47.301 --> 00:02:02.993]  Three people working in my office right now who are from Mexico and who work here legally and lawfully and they do a great job and they're on their way to be citizens down the road.
[00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:09.678]  So this isn't about not letting people be in the country who aren't from here.
[00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:16.623]  It's about having basic laws that at least match up with the average laws in the world.
[00:02:17.793 --> 00:02:29.740]  Because globalism is trying to end our sovereignty, and the big corporations want cheap labor, and the Democrats want a political pool they can put chips on the shoulders and create massive division.
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:45.989]  So this is a giant exercise in the media, picking some of the people that are here and would qualify for the Dreamer Act, who do speak three or four or five languages, who really are doing a great job, who really are EMTs, who really are good people.
[00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:46.930]  No one's denying that.
[00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:51.517]  Immigrants are some of the best workers and smartest folks we've got.
[00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:58.820]  Because America's been so free and so wealthy, a lot of Americans, I don't care if they're black, white, or Hispanic, or Asian, have gotten lazy.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.861]  And the statistics show that.
[00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:01.982]  So, I hire immigrants.
[00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:04.576]  Because they work hard on average.
[00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:06.177]  I guess the cliché is true.
[00:03:06.177 --> 00:03:12.542]  But within that cliché, there's a large group of criminals that are above the law because we've become lawless in this country.
[00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:17.866]  And that minority of criminals is creating a disproportionate amount of crime.
[00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.087]  And no one can debate that.
[00:03:20.087 --> 00:03:26.412]  And so all the whining and all the screaming and all the gnashing of teeth is nothing but hype.
[00:03:26.412 --> 00:03:28.534]  I can't go to Brazil.
[00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:29.714]  I can't go to Mexico.
[00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:45.986]  I can't go to Russia, I can't go to China, I can't go to Nigeria, I can't go to Japan and say I've lived there for 20 years and suddenly they just make you a citizen when you came there illegally or make you legal.
[00:03:45.986 --> 00:03:52.590]  Now here is the Attorney General talking about this today and then we'll be back with the big news on North Korea.
[00:03:56.534 --> 00:03:57.915]  Good morning.
[00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:07.324]  I'm here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded.
[00:04:07.324 --> 00:04:20.436]  The DACA program was implemented in 2012 and essentially provided a legal status for recipients for a renewable two-year term, worker authorization, and other benefits
[00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:29.558]  Including participation in the social security program to 800,000 mostly adult illegal aliens.
[00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:44.782]  The policy was implemented unilaterally to great controversy and legal concern after Congress rejected legislative proposals to extend similar benefits on numerous occasions to this same group of illegal aliens.
[00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.854]  And that's all this is, is Trump reasserting our sovereignty.
[00:04:52.854 --> 00:04:57.658]  And the media is trying to turn reality upside down and act like this is evil.
[00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:10.717]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:13.258]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[00:05:13.258 --> 00:05:16.720]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.901]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:23.743]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[00:05:23.743 --> 00:05:26.624]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:30.826]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[00:05:33.727 --> 00:05:34.628]  Unprecedented.
[00:05:34.628 --> 00:05:35.850]  And it's cold-pressed.
[00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.792]  That's why Super Mayo is so different.
[00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:40.695]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science.
[00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:44.139]  These are other... What you sell, BuzzFeed said, is already best-selling stuff.
[00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.202]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[00:05:46.202 --> 00:05:47.403]  Why, these aren't anything new.
[00:05:47.403 --> 00:05:51.468]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[00:05:51.468 --> 00:05:52.089]  Dude!
[00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.169]  Dude!
[00:05:59.667 --> 00:05:59.867]  I think?
[00:06:14.994 --> 00:06:15.514]  We're good to go.
[00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:43.697]  We're good.
[00:07:00.242 --> 00:07:04.928]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.542]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:25.424]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.424 --> 00:08:32.126]  It is already the fifth day of September 2017.
[00:08:32.126 --> 00:08:40.790]  Coming up, Vladimir Putin.
[00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.451]  The South Korean president as well, the Japanese president.
[00:08:44.736 --> 00:08:51.819]  And our own Pentagon all agree the world has never been closer to thermal nuclear war as it is right now.
[00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:56.442]  We're going to go over the latest developments with the crisis of crises.
[00:08:57.563 --> 00:09:04.404]  Nuclear-armed North Korea with hydrogen bombs threatening all-out nuclear war against their neighbors.
[00:09:04.404 --> 00:09:09.506]  How long will the world sit here while this threat continues to expand?
[00:09:09.506 --> 00:09:21.068]  And can North Korea be reasoned with back from the edge of the abyss that megalomania and globalist appeasement has led us all to?
[00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:34.227]  First off, I want to get into the secrets of the DREAM Act and DACA's recension by the President today.
[00:09:34.227 --> 00:09:36.429]  The President is following the law.
[00:09:37.717 --> 00:09:48.162]  Obama had lots of executive orders where he would advertise that illegals by the millions could pour in, and then the media would simply call them children.
[00:09:48.162 --> 00:09:59.187]  Some of them 45-year-old, multiple-time serial killers who'd been deported in some cases more than 40 times.
[00:09:59.187 --> 00:10:06.870]  But they just kept saying, oh, but I went to school in Los Angeles, or I went to school in Austin, Texas, and look, I'm in the yearbook.
[00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:10.179]  That shows how long this has been going on.
[00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:11.481]  And here's the issue.
[00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:18.813]  Mexico or China doesn't let you go there and do anything like the DREAM Act or anything like Anchor Babies or any of it.
[00:10:20.285 --> 00:10:21.746]  It's not fair.
[00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:24.047]  That's the secret of the DREAM Act.
[00:10:24.047 --> 00:10:30.189]  And it's being used as a political tool by the Democrats and the Republicans that want cheap labor and voting blocks.
[00:10:30.189 --> 00:10:43.174]  And it is penalizing people that come here legally and lawfully, that go to school here in college, that then get their work visas and contribute to the economy.
[00:10:43.174 --> 00:10:45.095]  And I'm all for work visas.
[00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:48.092]  In things that are needed.
[00:10:48.092 --> 00:10:55.276]  In areas in the economy where workers are needed and hard-working folks and smart people are needed.
[00:10:55.276 --> 00:11:06.482]  But when it talks about something like engineering or manufacturing, the unions are out today decrying Trump as racist, saying DACA will keep wages up.
[00:11:06.482 --> 00:11:07.422]  No, it's the opposite.
[00:11:07.422 --> 00:11:10.804]  It'll drive wages down to keep that in place.
[00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:12.445]  That's what all the economists know.
[00:11:12.445 --> 00:11:13.906]  So it's a lot of deception.
[00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:21.429]  And since we've had NAFTA and GATT and since we've had more open borders, we've seen our wages go where?
[00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:22.030]  Straight down.
[00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:29.334]  There's all these graphs that they put out showing by the mid-1970s that American prosperity began to wane.
[00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:31.735]  And they say, oh, it's because we're capitalists.
[00:11:31.735 --> 00:11:33.957]  No, it's because of offshoring.
[00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:47.489]  And it's because of bringing in large third world populations and allowing corporations to use the labor to undercut the middle class of every race, color, and creed.
[00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:52.751]  This is a fact that in Latin America the power structure teach people poor by design.
[00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:54.392]  It is a fact in Eastern Europe.
[00:11:54.392 --> 00:11:56.112]  That's what's been done for thousands of years.
[00:11:56.112 --> 00:11:59.073]  It's a fact that's done in most areas of Asia.
[00:11:59.073 --> 00:12:03.055]  The rich families get together and they openly do not want innovation
[00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:08.631]  They want stagnant, class-driven systems.
[00:12:08.631 --> 00:12:16.275]  Now that's started to get eroded in India, starting to get eroded in areas of Africa, starting to get eroded in Latin America, and I'm all for it.
[00:12:16.275 --> 00:12:27.960]  Because if you ever gave free market to many areas of Asia or Latin America, they would take off and within a few decades be gorgeous, amazing, clean, safe, beautiful places.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.121]  But they've never been allowed to have it.
[00:12:31.274 --> 00:12:32.734]  And that is the real problem.
[00:12:32.734 --> 00:12:38.196]  Turning us, though, into these collapsed nations and these collapsed cultures is not going to fix anything.
[00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:51.139]  And the globalists, in their own white papers, admit that they want a large quagmire, a giant underclass, and that they want to get rid of English being the world language to sabotage the world communicating with each other.
[00:12:52.554 --> 00:12:55.739]  Tower of Babelism is what I'd call it.
[00:12:55.739 --> 00:12:59.584]  A new language, a new world system called Babelism.
[00:12:59.584 --> 00:13:08.838]  Here it is out of Campus Reform, Major Global Society for Social Studies, the main group on the globe, meeting in Boston as we speak.
[00:13:10.111 --> 00:13:12.431]  They just stopped meeting this weekend.
[00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:17.232]  Academic conference aims to de-center English in higher ed.
[00:13:17.232 --> 00:13:27.094]  You've got all the admissions of bringing down Europe, and I played a clip on the Sunday show of the Vice President of the EU saying we must end the whiteness of Europe.
[00:13:27.094 --> 00:13:30.775]  Any country being a central culture is bad.
[00:13:30.775 --> 00:13:37.376]  Well, bad for globalism that's overriding all the cultures, getting rid of them, so AI can come sweeping in.
[00:13:38.908 --> 00:13:46.337]  So global, total, standardized control can be in place.
[00:13:46.337 --> 00:13:50.141]  I had an all-night dream last night.
[00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:57.791]  Whether it was my mind focusing on all the research and projecting in a visual extravaganza what was coming.
[00:13:59.957 --> 00:14:21.624]  Or whether I've just watched too much science fiction, or whether I've read too many statements by top tech gurus, or Vladimir Putin, but man, I had a dream last night about AI takeover that was unbelievable, and so graphic, and so step-by-step, like I was being given a briefing in chapters of what was going to come, and I woke up about 3 a.m.
[00:14:21.624 --> 00:14:25.485]  with a sickening, sad, overwhelmed feeling.
[00:14:25.485 --> 00:14:28.726]  Not a feeling of fear, but I understood why the globalists
[00:14:29.286 --> 00:14:36.427]  have just acquiesced to this spirit, because they're so horrified by it, they just hope they don't get destroyed by it.
[00:14:36.427 --> 00:14:57.791]  Because regardless of what my dream was, vision, or prime projection analysis, or a little bit of both, what humans envision most of the time ends up becoming a reality, and what I was envisioning in that in-depth, vivid dream is what most of the elites believe is going to be basically manifest very, very soon.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:05.991]  But I know this, if you turn it into a science fiction movie, man, unbelievable.
[00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:12.942]  So maybe today, maybe tomorrow, I don't want to just get into something this big and just kind of have it as a side issue.
[00:15:16.488 --> 00:15:23.012]  May get into that in the days and weeks to come, because I did have a dream of jets flying in the World Trade Centers and things like that.
[00:15:23.012 --> 00:15:28.215]  I did warn people they were going to blow it up two months before it happened and said they blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[00:15:28.215 --> 00:15:30.157]  People asked how I knew that.
[00:15:30.157 --> 00:15:36.340]  The media has confirmed that I did indeed say that, exactly those words, and I had recurring dreams of it happening.
[00:15:37.661 --> 00:15:40.443]  So, just a little tidbit.
[00:15:40.443 --> 00:15:46.148]  There's a lot of things going on in this world that aren't in all the establishment's books, and they know that.
[00:15:46.148 --> 00:15:52.413]  But, let me now just get into the main issue, obviously, the thing on our plate right now.
[00:15:52.413 --> 00:16:04.483]  Thermonuclear war, the hydrogen bomb, tested over the weekend in North Korea, ten times more powerful, showing up way over a sixth magnitude on the Richter scale for a earthquake.
[00:16:05.493 --> 00:16:10.376]  And confirming that indeed a massive hydrogen bomb was tested.
[00:16:10.376 --> 00:16:20.761]  And now they've shown videos and photos of hydrogen bomb casings that they can load on top of ICBMs.
[00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:22.442]  And they're threatening to nuke Tokyo.
[00:16:22.442 --> 00:16:25.044]  They're threatening to nuke Seoul, South Korea.
[00:16:25.044 --> 00:16:26.985]  They're threatening to attack us preemptively.
[00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:32.968]  North Korea threats prompt Japan evacuation preparedness.
[00:16:32.968 --> 00:16:34.309]  That's out of Japan.
[00:16:35.902 --> 00:16:39.367]  Putin says that the nation that leads in AI will be the ruler of the world.
[00:16:39.367 --> 00:16:42.210]  I'm going to get more into that today.
[00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:50.121]  Putin's also come out and said military hysteria over North Korea may lead to planetary catastrophe, heavy loss of life.
[00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:55.167]  Yes, we're coming up against a big crisis right now.
[00:16:55.167 --> 00:17:10.024]  And notice the Democrats in Time Magazine and Newsweek, all back in January and back in February after Trump had been elected, we need to dig these back up, said, oh don't worry, Trump's going to be challenged by something internationally.
[00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:19.513]  When he's first in office that we'll see what his medal's made of, and to see if he can take it, and to see if he'll go ahead and join the globalists.
[00:17:19.513 --> 00:17:23.534]  And then immediately, we know they have globalist back channels in North Korea.
[00:17:23.534 --> 00:17:34.478]  He began to break every agreement and go completely crazy in everyone's face, knowing that he's got big supporters in the Republican and Democratic Party, as well as in the Communist Chinese Party of China.
[00:17:36.385 --> 00:17:38.826]  And indeed, the Daily Caller has a big article up.
[00:17:38.826 --> 00:17:44.509]  Anti-Trump resistance groups, some of the largest of the nation, spreading North Korean propaganda.
[00:17:44.509 --> 00:17:54.354]  And even CNN and the New York Times and The Hill are bad-mouthing Trump and our military.
[00:17:54.354 --> 00:17:59.617]  And acting like that they are the bad guys.
[00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:14.824]  This is just lunacy, but this is the whole Machiavellian, everybody stabbing each other in the back paradigm that the globalists have basically created.
[00:18:14.824 --> 00:18:28.253]  While they're busy trying to dominate Christians and mount our head politically on the wall and make sure they can sexualize our children, the folks at CNN and Salon and all the rest of the enemy media are busy digging their own cultural, historical, economic,
[00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:35.406]  civilizational graves.
[00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.627]  It's the stuff that collapse is made of.
[00:18:37.627 --> 00:18:38.447]  Look at RT.
[00:18:38.447 --> 00:18:44.510]  Putin, military hysteria over North Korea may lead to planetary catastrophe, heavy loss of life.
[00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.291]  But notice, that's RT.
[00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:49.413]  Notice how the Hill spun it.
[00:18:49.413 --> 00:18:53.415]  Putin urges Trump to avoid hysteria on North Korea, which is not
[00:18:54.775 --> 00:18:55.456]  Well, he did.
[00:18:55.456 --> 00:18:57.137]  They changed the headline.
[00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.520]  Originally, it was what Putin actually said.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.421]  You can see it in the URL.
[00:19:01.421 --> 00:19:03.824]  Putin warns North
[00:19:05.404 --> 00:19:08.345]  Korea could lead to global catastrophe.
[00:19:08.345 --> 00:19:09.925]  So the URL stayed the same.
[00:19:09.925 --> 00:19:13.926]  They'd have to kill the story if they did change the URL.
[00:19:13.926 --> 00:19:15.607]  But then they changed the headline.
[00:19:15.607 --> 00:19:17.767]  Putin urges Trump to avoid hysteria on North Korea.
[00:19:17.767 --> 00:19:24.389]  See, everything is about undermining our president because the globalists are tasked with decentralizing
[00:19:26.613 --> 00:19:36.359]  National power from the people and transferring it to a new centralization, a technocracy controlled by supercomputers that the globalists program for the outcomes they want.
[00:19:36.359 --> 00:19:43.703]  And that ties into Obama and this letter that he leaked, that he supposedly privately gave to Trump.
[00:19:43.703 --> 00:19:44.844]  Isn't that nice of him?
[00:19:44.844 --> 00:19:52.188]  Leaking the letter that was supposedly private, saying your job is to sustain the international order of world government.
[00:19:52.188 --> 00:19:52.348]  Wow!
[00:19:53.157 --> 00:19:55.878]  You've come a long way because all this garbage is now out in the open.

[00:22:13.058 --> 00:22:15.920]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.740]  That's true.
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.263]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:21.495]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[00:23:27.196 --> 00:23:28.017]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:23:28.017 --> 00:23:29.818]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:23:29.818 --> 00:23:31.460]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.282]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:23:34.282 --> 00:23:36.584]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:23:36.584 --> 00:23:41.088]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:23:41.088 --> 00:23:45.031]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:23:45.031 --> 00:23:48.814]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:23:48.814 --> 00:23:49.135]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:23:49.135 --> 00:23:50.856]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:55.509]  I had a waking dream last night that was just made up in my subconscious mind of the some parts of real events that have already taken place or are taking place but the projection into the future along different computational lines and of course the subconscious mind is hundreds if not thousands of times more powerful than the conscious mind
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:02.121]  And that's why we get feelings in our gut, the brain, through the spinal cord.
[00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:07.643]  We'll get our attention where it knows it gets our attention, in our stomach.
[00:25:07.643 --> 00:25:11.144]  In our sixth sense.
[00:25:11.144 --> 00:25:14.365]  And I just realized something, I've already realized, but it hit me so strong.
[00:25:14.365 --> 00:25:23.247]  I've got a lot more peace now than I've had in my frustration and my anger and my gibbering all these factoids out trying to convince people of what's going on.
[00:25:25.589 --> 00:25:31.312]  That this really is in God's hands and it's a spiritual choice we have to make.
[00:25:31.312 --> 00:25:46.059]  And that the rulers of this earth are scared of the spirit of this world and they have just completely shined themselves over through fear, most of them not even through lust for power.
[00:25:46.059 --> 00:25:47.900]  That's mid-level and low-level folks.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.502]  The very top of this, you don't have incompetent people like Nancy Pelosi and
[00:25:54.031 --> 00:25:58.452]  Chuck Schumer and folks like that little grasping nobodies.
[00:25:58.452 --> 00:26:20.779]  You've got really, really smart people that are scared and also fascinated with the universe and who think they've made their bets with the winning party.
[00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:22.760]  And they're all fighting for control of the planet.
[00:26:23.814 --> 00:26:45.099]  To then dutifully execute this blueprint that no matter if you're in France or Russia or China or the United States or Egypt gets expressed beyond any
[00:26:53.419 --> 00:27:05.668]  Explainable way in the modern limited spectrum of kosher thought.
[00:27:05.668 --> 00:27:16.657]  And more and more of the establishment is just completely dialed out and just thinks we're a complete joke and kind of has MSNBC and CNN and the academia and the media as a rearguard action.
[00:27:19.301 --> 00:27:30.310]  To just entertain people and confuse people and make people as cowardly and dysfunctional as possible so they never know what even hits them.
[00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:36.675]  See, a spider will bite you.
[00:27:36.675 --> 00:27:43.360]  If you're a bug, it's going to eat and just put a little bit of venom into you to immobilize you.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.701]  And then it'll tie you up.
[00:27:49.008 --> 00:27:54.752]  And pumps some more venom in just to liquefy enough of you that you're barely still alive and your heart's still barely beating.
[00:27:54.752 --> 00:28:00.597]  Then the spider comes over and puts its front leg up on you and checks the heart rate.
[00:28:00.597 --> 00:28:07.142]  Okay, it's almost normal and then kind of waits and just knows and comes over and touches it again to see, okay, you're pretty much liquefied.
[00:28:07.142 --> 00:28:11.886]  Bites you again to kill you to fully liquefy everything and then sucks the juices out.
[00:28:12.554 --> 00:28:28.262]  And that's what all this attack on the family and attack on farming and attack on men being men and women being women, all of this is simply us tied up in a spider's web with this entity, this system, getting us ready for the big stroke.
[00:28:28.262 --> 00:28:31.424]  It's kind of like a matador gets the bull angry and
[00:28:32.537 --> 00:28:56.366]  Throws the darts into his back, and gets him really into a big lather, and prepares him for the crowd, and then tells the crowd, now I'll deal the death blow, and has the red cape, the distraction, and then runs the sword straight into the heart, using the strength of the bull itself to force that sword through a foot or more of meat and bone.
[00:28:56.366 --> 00:28:57.547]  Not an easy feat.
[00:29:00.606 --> 00:29:07.448]  And if you can do it on the first stab without having to be handed another sword, why, you're one of the greats, aren't you?
[00:29:07.448 --> 00:29:27.734]  And that's all they're doing is just getting us all lathered up in a bunch of darts in our back, and we're kicking and snorting, snarling and running, and they're just sitting back, just sitting back with that sword, gonna run that sucker right down through our ribs, right into our heart, not
[00:29:28.866 --> 00:29:41.855]  If people are conscious of the operation, and I am conscious of it, that's why the globalists fear us, that's why they've been trying to inoculate you psychologically not to listen, because they know that I'm going to have these breakthroughs to the next level.
[00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:43.556]  And I've had the breakthroughs.
[00:29:43.556 --> 00:29:46.618]  I've been having them, but now I've got the full picture.
[00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:47.879]  I've got the full battle plan.
[00:29:47.879 --> 00:29:49.260]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.881]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:50.881 --> 00:29:54.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.312 --> 00:30:01.414]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:30:01.414 --> 00:30:03.735]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:04.796]  Why we have them.
[00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:08.178]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[00:30:08.178 --> 00:30:13.682]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[00:30:13.682 --> 00:30:20.727]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[00:30:20.727 --> 00:30:28.592]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white
[00:30:29.712 --> 00:30:36.194]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[00:30:36.194 --> 00:30:44.135]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contained ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[00:30:44.135 --> 00:30:46.796]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[00:30:46.796 --> 00:30:49.636]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[00:30:49.636 --> 00:30:53.697]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters,
[00:30:53.797 --> 00:30:56.239]  But extends even to those we love to hate.
[00:30:56.239 --> 00:30:59.241]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[00:30:59.241 --> 00:31:08.329]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:31:08.329 --> 00:31:16.735]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:16.735 --> 00:31:21.379]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:28.385]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:28.385 --> 00:31:35.571]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:31:35.571 --> 00:31:42.596]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:31:42.596 --> 00:31:46.920]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.464]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:31:50.464 --> 00:31:56.750]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.754]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:59.754 --> 00:32:04.499]  Men, give your body the support it needs with Infowars Life Prostagard.
[00:32:04.499 --> 00:32:08.523]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.
[00:32:08.903 --> 00:32:20.133]  InfoWarsLife has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[00:32:20.133 --> 00:32:28.120]  The Prostagard formula does just that, with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:33.045]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols,
[00:32:33.565 --> 00:32:34.585]  We're good to go.
[00:33:01.138 --> 00:33:03.783]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:03.783 --> 00:33:08.953]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:42.216 --> 00:33:45.558]  What am I getting at when I say I've got the big picture?
[00:33:45.558 --> 00:33:57.665]  Well, I guarantee you that when I go over this information today, tomorrow, whenever it is, that you're going to say, tell us something we didn't know.
[00:33:57.665 --> 00:34:00.267]  We know this is the absolute truth.
[00:34:00.267 --> 00:34:08.232]  This is what we all know in our hearts, what we all know in our guts, and what is already manifesting in front of us.
[00:34:08.232 --> 00:34:11.534]  So when I say that I am at peace, I understand
[00:34:14.195 --> 00:34:18.097]  That there's no going around this, there's no stopping this.
[00:34:18.097 --> 00:34:21.780]  This is going to be the final test of humanity.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:39.110]  The epiphany is the race garbage and the infighting and the selfishness and caring about Hollywood and caring about big nice things and caring about just the accumulation of material.
[00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.512]  I've never been obsessed with it, it's never been my god.
[00:34:42.827 --> 00:34:46.709]  It's never been at the top of my hierarchy of needs.
[00:34:46.709 --> 00:34:53.393]  But now I absolutely loathe it.
[00:34:53.393 --> 00:34:57.696]  Because it's used to control people.
[00:34:57.696 --> 00:35:00.898]  Again, I'm stating completely just known facts here.
[00:35:01.932 --> 00:35:19.563]  And that's why the Globalists try to keep people poor so that they always are obsessed only on the lower level material and never go up the true steps of development to see the heights of the universe that lay out before us.
[00:35:19.563 --> 00:35:21.925]  They never come out of Plato's cave.
[00:35:21.925 --> 00:35:26.408]  And the Globalist's great crime is they are attempting to have total world dominion
[00:35:27.278 --> 00:35:43.752]  Play God, have absolute AI control over all human, animal, plant, bacterial activity, rewrite the planet, in a type of Genesis weapon event.
[00:35:43.752 --> 00:35:49.678]  And then you're like, yeah, Alex, you're not enlightening anybody about anything we didn't already know.
[00:35:49.678 --> 00:35:51.559]  It's in all the popular culture.
[00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:53.161]  They're telling us what they're planning to do.
[00:35:54.585 --> 00:36:07.579]  But let me tell you, it doesn't look in the different scenarios that have been written down scientifically by top theoreticians and futurists, it doesn't look like some painless genesis event.
[00:36:10.734 --> 00:36:18.299]  Like they'd have in Star Trek Rathacon, where you shoot a dead planet with a system and suddenly it creates life.
[00:36:18.299 --> 00:36:38.051]  This is something that chews up life that was already there and then spits it out on the other side, something completely different and that uses all the ingenuity and science and technology and raw minerals and raw rare earth systems that we've brought to the surface to just plug in a nanotech
[00:36:39.264 --> 00:37:00.638]  Think 3D printer on a colossal scale that instantaneously sucks in matter, reorganizes it in the way it's been programmed, and builds an entire new system as it overwrites the original.
[00:37:00.638 --> 00:37:08.363]  In an act of total, willful, complete domination over the planet, over God's creation, and over our free will.
[00:37:10.692 --> 00:37:14.016]  A giant satanic ritual.
[00:37:14.016 --> 00:37:19.121]  And that's what this planet now is, is a giant satanic experiment.
[00:37:19.121 --> 00:37:22.965]  We are deep, deep in the hold of it now.
[00:37:22.965 --> 00:37:28.591]  You can see the screen sickness, as I call it, people that watch television and play on their iPhones and don't talk to each other anymore.
[00:37:29.824 --> 00:37:36.267]  You can see the cultural breakdowns, the mental illness, the narcissism, all of it just rampantly exploding.
[00:37:36.267 --> 00:37:43.370]  And they all have that weird little piggy smile on their face and the eyes that are lit up like a jacket lantern.
[00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:46.811]  We've all got friends and family and neighbors that have succumbed to it.
[00:37:46.811 --> 00:37:51.233]  You look at Kim Jong-un when he's walking around trying to look self-confident and satisfied.
[00:37:51.233 --> 00:37:53.414]  That horrific demon creature.
[00:37:54.838 --> 00:38:16.166]  With that Jack O'Lantern smile, and all the sycophants scared to death worshipping him, and every sycophant beneath them worshipping them, and those beneath them worshipping those above them, in a giant, hierarchical, delusional virtual reality exercise.
[00:38:16.166 --> 00:38:17.767]  That's what delusion is.
[00:38:17.767 --> 00:38:22.709]  It's just activating some program in your brain that you're God,
[00:38:23.888 --> 00:38:29.752]  And that you're invincible and that you're all-powerful because you buy into the world, you buy into its fraud.
[00:38:29.752 --> 00:38:30.753]  It's a spirit.
[00:38:30.753 --> 00:38:39.218]  You don't need to go plug your brain in like PKD thought they would with a wire to be in ecstasy all the time so you don't want to leave the matrix.
[00:38:39.218 --> 00:38:53.768]  The truth is, as this world forces people into mental illness, it's a spiritual matrix where they're already gone, living in the third dimension, but no longer conscious, turning their psyches over to something completely different.
[00:38:59.318 --> 00:39:06.364]  It's amazing.
[00:39:06.364 --> 00:39:10.887]  So let me go ahead and just go over some headlines.
[00:39:10.887 --> 00:39:12.649]  That's probably the best thing to do.
[00:39:12.649 --> 00:39:27.501]  Here is President Vladimir Putin coming out and saying, whoever develops true AI first
[00:39:29.158 --> 00:39:32.721]  Will be the quote, ruler of the world.
[00:39:32.721 --> 00:39:54.477]  Whoever creates real AI, programmed and controlled by the people and the spirit of this world will be creating the technological black hole that will absorb
[00:39:56.328 --> 00:40:05.274]  This planet, in very rapid succession, might as well just create a strangelet or a black hole artificially at CERN and be done with it.
[00:40:05.274 --> 00:40:06.295]  Oh, sorry!
[00:40:06.295 --> 00:40:07.936]  They're trying to do that there!
[00:40:09.053 --> 00:40:35.610]  Then they put Shiva, the god of destruction and rebirth, there to worship her, while they admit they are engaging in particle acceleration experiments designed to create black holes, strangelets, and to break into other dimensions, which many physicists believe with the equations could cause catastrophic chain reaction explosions.
[00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.512]  If you think mining some mountains
[00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:48.226]  Mining some limestone and purifying it and then smashing it together with 1900 equations can destroy the planet.
[00:40:48.226 --> 00:40:52.408]  What do you think they're doing right now?
[00:40:52.408 --> 00:40:56.651]  And they're telling you what they're doing.
[00:40:56.651 --> 00:41:04.397]  And if the Hollywood folks think running to New Zealand is going to protect them, they've got another thing coming.
[00:41:08.962 --> 00:41:11.664]  It's the search for Godhood.
[00:41:11.664 --> 00:41:25.435]  And they are just running headlong like mad scientists of old.
[00:41:25.435 --> 00:41:28.458]  You take North Korea.
[00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:30.199]  They didn't have missiles that would go 50 miles in 1990.
[00:41:33.462 --> 00:41:44.952]  By 1996 they had missiles that could go 2,000 kilometers and they had A-bomb material from the reactors given to them by the Clintons.
[00:41:44.952 --> 00:41:49.676]  And Jimmy Carter and all the usual suspects.
[00:41:49.676 --> 00:41:51.018]  Show China how much we love them.
[00:41:51.018 --> 00:41:52.319]  Give them the Panama Canal.
[00:41:52.319 --> 00:41:53.500]  Show them how much we love them.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.421]  Give them nukes.
[00:41:54.421 --> 00:41:55.402]  Show them how much we love them.
[00:41:56.291 --> 00:42:07.401]  No, they just wanted factories and jobs and industry through the Communist Party that globalists could own part of and live in China part of the year like absolute kings.
[00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:17.009]  Word of a George Soros or somebody else over there in China doesn't like how somebody in the street talked to them, they tell a party official and just like that they're arrested and killed.
[00:42:17.009 --> 00:42:19.492]  Those are the type of people
[00:42:20.845 --> 00:42:32.128]  That are shaping our world completely cold-blooded while they tell you about Black Lives Matter and while they tell you about DACA and the Dreamers and how much Apple and Google and Facebook love you.
[00:42:32.128 --> 00:42:43.351]  When all of those companies are developing goods in the most horrific slave markets and slave pits in China.
[00:42:43.351 --> 00:42:44.472]  Oh, but they give money to
[00:42:45.836 --> 00:42:54.224]  Black Lives Matter to make that the only issue on the planet because it's a sick joke and creates division.
[00:42:54.224 --> 00:43:02.972]  They only undermine a country that had a foundation of basic freedom where the renaissance of ideas and technology could be for you and your family.
[00:43:02.972 --> 00:43:09.018]  The globalists only attack that and they only attack systems that would allow us to communicate with each other
[00:43:09.358 --> 00:43:19.567]  Admitting they want to create a Tower of Babel, where humans can't communicate and work together, so that we will fall to the new machine language.
[00:43:19.567 --> 00:43:27.574]  They envisioned this 160 years ago in England, when they launched the program of modern eugenics and biometrics.
[00:43:27.574 --> 00:43:30.977]  Now you don't think they just thought this up theoretically, do you?
[00:43:33.473 --> 00:43:57.803]  Go read where Galton and Wedgwood and Huxley and Darwin and others, go read where they say they got all this information, everything you're seeing, the computers, the double helix, the biometrics, the barcodes in the Nazi death camps, all of it, all of it, all of it in visions.
[00:43:57.803 --> 00:44:01.205]  And they inbred five British families, this is all public,
[00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:09.374]  To produce a super psychic that could receive from beyond the void the information.
[00:44:09.374 --> 00:44:17.981]  I don't care if they make fun of us about this because this isn't what I believe, this is what they believe.
[00:44:17.981 --> 00:44:21.524]  And so they theoretically envision in the 1850s and 60s.
[00:44:21.524 --> 00:44:23.665]  It's in my film Endgame.
[00:44:23.665 --> 00:44:26.327]  Mainstream news, Eugenics Quarterly, all of it.
[00:44:26.327 --> 00:44:31.491]  The entire plan.
[00:44:31.491 --> 00:44:32.092]  That's why in the
[00:44:34.053 --> 00:44:46.618]  Late 1890s, they had science fiction writers writing about atomic and hydrogen bombs, even though the equations hadn't officially been put out until a few years later.
[00:44:46.618 --> 00:44:48.319]  Why is that?
[00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:52.661]  Why did they do that?
[00:44:52.661 --> 00:44:54.382]  This is hardcore, folks.
[00:44:54.382 --> 00:44:57.343]  This is what the false Illuminati really are.
[00:44:57.343 --> 00:45:02.145]  And I've got so much news to cover, but Putin says the nation that
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.863]  Leeds, in AI, will be the ruler of the world.
[00:45:06.863 --> 00:45:32.823]  No, the nation that leads in AI will appear to take over the world, but it will really be AI and the driverless cars and the systems and the smart dust and the tracking and the Internet of Things giving the AI its complete interface with humans and animals and plants to have close to synthetic, limited, omnipresent vision.
[00:45:34.445 --> 00:45:40.387]  Which they admit is to predict the future, then control stimuli to control the future.
[00:45:40.387 --> 00:45:50.712]  And then the individuals will worship the beast, whose image will be everywhere, and whose likeness will be everywhere, and who will be walking amongst a scene everywhere.
[00:45:50.712 --> 00:45:59.996]  A computer consciousness walking around in robots, in your appliances, in your little smartphone, in your TV shows, always there.
[00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:02.817]  Medical breakthroughs, scientific breakthroughs,
[00:46:04.298 --> 00:46:08.259]  Homes built in minutes by Nanotech.
[00:46:08.259 --> 00:46:09.860]  Anything you could ever imagine.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:16.141]  Everyone being given their World ID card and free stuff on their card.
[00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:17.122]  Free money.
[00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:19.982]  No more having to work.
[00:46:19.982 --> 00:46:21.063]  Enjoying yourself.
[00:46:21.063 --> 00:46:22.483]  Doing whatever you want.
[00:46:22.483 --> 00:46:27.324]  All the time getting sucked deeper and deeper out of the land.
[00:46:27.324 --> 00:46:29.345]  Out of the real world.
[00:46:29.345 --> 00:46:31.745]  Into the artificial construct.
[00:46:31.745 --> 00:46:33.046]  Until when they drop the hammer.
[00:46:33.939 --> 00:46:40.844]  And this thing goes to its next phase, once its webs and tentacles are grown into anything and everything.
[00:46:40.844 --> 00:46:42.566]  All the crops are GMO.
[00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:44.267]  All the vaccines are nanotech.
[00:46:44.267 --> 00:46:54.095]  Once all of that is in place, they will then drop the hammer into the next level of what they believe is directed evolution.
[00:46:54.095 --> 00:47:00.780]  And they've already made the decision that we're obsolete, that they're going to merge the machines and become God, and help
[00:47:02.762 --> 00:47:09.606]  Rid the earth of the horrible scourge that is homo sapien sapien.
[00:47:09.606 --> 00:47:19.292]  When really it's just an excuse, total genocide, mass exterminism, an absolute orgy of satanic power.
[00:47:19.292 --> 00:47:27.717]  But just as the Bible warned us of all this, you have to ask yourself, are they using it as a blueprint of control?
[00:47:27.717 --> 00:47:30.439]  A pre-planned program?
[00:47:32.093 --> 00:47:33.513]  Predictive programming?
[00:47:33.513 --> 00:47:35.634]  A missionary protectorate?
[00:47:35.634 --> 00:47:36.334]  No.
[00:47:36.334 --> 00:47:39.595]  People saying that are deluding themselves.
[00:47:39.595 --> 00:47:47.618]  This is the universe, God's way of giving us a free will chance to recognize the mark of the beast, the world government.
[00:47:47.618 --> 00:47:59.302]  Already, hundreds of conservative libertarian Christian groups in Europe, the United States, and Canada, and Australia cannot buy or sell, cannot have PayPal accounts, cannot have Amazon accounts, and soon those will be the only accounts there are.
[00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:14.015]  The environmental police are going into all the rural areas, the Amish communities, all the groups that have broken off from this system, and policing them, and attacking them, and encircling them, and outlawing them.
[00:48:17.631 --> 00:48:45.401]  It is a total takeover and many people serving it know the plan and they want to be servants of it and believe that they are going to be in the upper echelons of this program and somehow they'll break away from us after disgracing humanity, disgracing our species, selling out to pure evil, that you are going to cross the river.
[00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:45.761]  Jordan.
[00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:54.013]  Enter the promised land.
[00:48:54.013 --> 00:49:02.837]  Metaphysically, if you were a good person, like Moses, you wouldn't pass across because you were part of the old and still so evil because you knew everything.
[00:49:02.837 --> 00:49:04.698]  The world had to be innocent again.
[00:49:04.698 --> 00:49:07.379]  The children had to be crossed.
[00:49:07.379 --> 00:49:14.442]  Whole generations that didn't remember all the corruption, the manipulation, the evil, the worshipping, the golden calf.
[00:49:14.442 --> 00:49:16.023]  You will be the last people
[00:49:17.722 --> 00:49:22.792]  That would ever, even if Satan wasn't running this program, make it across.
[00:49:23.953 --> 00:49:25.794]  But you enjoy the power!
[00:49:25.794 --> 00:49:32.317]  You enjoy playing like you're in the priest class and you've entered into the temple and now you can see all the secrets!
[00:49:32.317 --> 00:49:45.584]  Even as you work around the clock to block it from the public and to make sure they don't have any real free will to decide what they want to do, you want to slip them into a hot bath and slip their wrist so they don't even feel that you've slipped their wrist.
[00:49:45.584 --> 00:49:50.227]  Well, you put a nice little TV show on for them, a little baby mobile for them,
[00:49:50.447 --> 00:50:06.851]  So they can watch the pretty colors projected while their blood drains down into the sewer.
[00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:08.311]  Let's skip this break.
[00:50:08.311 --> 00:50:11.252]  Here is Vladimir Putin.
[00:50:11.252 --> 00:50:15.953]  Says the nation that leads in AI will be the ruler of the world.
[00:50:15.953 --> 00:50:16.093]  No!
[00:50:17.574 --> 00:50:46.565]  The nation that leads in AI will open the gates of hell, as you've already seen, because the technology that's been developed is twisted and is fallen, and by every measurement, by every gauge, by every metric, by every system, it is destroying our health, our minds, our creativity, our beauty, our strength, our honor, our will.
[00:50:49.577 --> 00:51:13.810]  And so here is humanity at the threshold, at the great crossroads of our ancient and great past, on this planet, set out again to see if we can pass, to see if we can pass the test when we've been warned and given the blueprints.
[00:51:17.423 --> 00:51:24.548]  Something tells me, in other tests, God didn't give people a warning or a blueprint.
[00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:36.757]  Something tells me, deep down, this has been done a couple times before, and we're way out here in the middle of nowhere, because we're dangerous.
[00:51:36.757 --> 00:51:41.941]  See, who knows if we pass this test, if there'll be another test.
[00:51:41.941 --> 00:51:43.242]  And still another.
[00:51:43.242 --> 00:51:45.384]  We're creatures that can envision
[00:51:46.317 --> 00:51:57.543]  And then build all the splendor, all the magic, all the science, all the incredible inventions you've seen.
[00:51:57.543 --> 00:52:01.405]  So why does the television tell you you're crap all day?
[00:52:01.405 --> 00:52:03.045]  Why does it shovel ugliness at you?
[00:52:03.045 --> 00:52:04.146]  Well, it's declassified.
[00:52:05.725 --> 00:52:18.355]  The CIA, run by the Ford Foundation, starting in the 1950s, wants to shovel ugliness at you, ugly architecture, ugly culture, wants to break up everything so you are scared and alone.
[00:52:18.355 --> 00:52:28.142]  And again, it's in all the WikiLeaks documents.
[00:52:28.142 --> 00:52:31.865]  It's in the Facebook, how they want to keep you alone and stupid.
[00:52:35.874 --> 00:52:44.721]  It's in all their own admissions that they've got you targeted and surrounded with fake bots who you think are your friends, and a few of your real friends that troll through.
[00:52:44.721 --> 00:52:50.145]  And as prisoners, you have no idea you're going over the edge of a cliff together.
[00:52:50.145 --> 00:52:52.327]  Now, I should have plugged at the beginning.
[00:52:52.327 --> 00:52:53.548]  I'm not good at that.
[00:52:53.548 --> 00:52:56.950]  Ted Nugent's coming on.
[00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.772]  I noticed he was in a Blabbermouth article.
[00:52:58.772 --> 00:53:00.313]  In fact, I meant to give it to you guys.
[00:53:00.313 --> 00:53:00.753]  Can you grab it?
[00:53:00.753 --> 00:53:01.934]  I'll Blabbermouth.
[00:53:01.934 --> 00:53:02.795]  There's some audio of it.
[00:53:03.806 --> 00:53:12.176]  Or he said he talked to some of his tech folks in the government and they said, hey, Nugent, did you know you're really, you know, 15 times bigger than what they say on Facebook?
[00:53:12.176 --> 00:53:14.178]  Well, I didn't need to hear that from his tech people.
[00:53:14.178 --> 00:53:17.482]  I've seen him when he's got 25 million followers on Facebook.
[00:53:17.482 --> 00:53:18.663]  And then a month later, there's 2 million.
[00:53:21.647 --> 00:53:43.243]  They do that because you have to pay Facebook, but because it's racketeering, because it's criminal, they don't really advertise it, but you have to go buy advertising on Facebook, then they allow you, if you say you've got 2 million people or 5 or 20 or 30, to reach a few more percentage of folks that came and joined because they like you.
[00:53:43.243 --> 00:53:46.566]  But you're only renting this space from Facebook that isn't even real.
[00:53:48.308 --> 00:53:49.689]  And so Nugent's talking about it.
[00:53:49.689 --> 00:53:58.277]  I heard talk radio making fun of him, Luke Carl, kind of making fun of him on on XM.
[00:53:58.277 --> 00:54:06.765]  And so when I got home, I just search engine Facebook censoring conservatives and found that's probably 40 articles in my hand.
[00:54:06.765 --> 00:54:13.872]  So I thought I'd get the Motor City Madman on just to talk about censorship and to back up what he's saying and what he was told.
[00:54:16.092 --> 00:54:21.955]  The way Facebook works is, hey, you ought to really be nice to Facebook.
[00:54:21.955 --> 00:54:23.576]  They'd be nice to you.
[00:54:23.576 --> 00:54:30.139]  And suddenly videos I was putting out were going from a couple hundred thousand on average to five, ten million a piece every time.
[00:54:30.139 --> 00:54:31.600]  They took the controls off.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:35.041]  And then I came out and trashed Facebook when they violated some other people's rights.
[00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:36.842]  Instantly it was taken away.
[00:54:36.842 --> 00:54:37.302]  Instantly.
[00:54:37.302 --> 00:54:37.963]  That's how this works.
[00:54:37.963 --> 00:54:38.463]  Carrot and stick.
[00:54:40.031 --> 00:54:40.631]  That's fine.
[00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:41.912]  I'm there probing Facebook.
[00:54:41.912 --> 00:54:43.112]  I'm there showing their operations.
[00:54:43.112 --> 00:54:44.053]  That's what we do.
[00:54:44.053 --> 00:54:48.235]  It's up to our audience to get this information out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:48.235 --> 00:54:49.655]  You can't be stopped.
[00:54:49.655 --> 00:54:50.836]  But here is Putin.
[00:54:50.836 --> 00:54:53.657]  I'm going to have to interpret this.
[00:54:53.657 --> 00:54:57.919]  It's got subtitles, but here it is.
[00:54:57.919 --> 00:55:00.040]  Artificial intelligence is the future.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:03.622]  But only, not only for Russia, but all of mankind.
[00:55:03.622 --> 00:55:06.823]  If it comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict.
[00:55:09.687 --> 00:55:16.731]  Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.
[00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:25.556]  And it would not be very desirable that this monopoly be concentrated in someone's sick hands.
[00:55:25.556 --> 00:55:27.297]  That's why we become leaders in this area.
[00:55:28.822 --> 00:55:36.825]  We will share this know-how to the entire world, the same way we share our nuclear technologies today.
[00:55:36.825 --> 00:55:45.027]  But in order not to stand at the end of the line, you need to work on it today.
[00:55:45.027 --> 00:55:48.728]  Powerful.
[00:55:48.728 --> 00:55:56.251]  And I'm not saying Putin's wrong that we shouldn't study AI and whoever comes up with it will be the leader.
[00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:56.691]  It's that
[00:55:58.416 --> 00:56:12.434]  The way all the other technologies have proliferated, been twisted, been used for evil, and with how the globalists, at least in the West, are pushing it, is exterminist, post-industrial world, post-human world, why the future doesn't need us.
[00:56:12.434 --> 00:56:15.517]  I mean, these are all mainline white papers that I'm giving you the names of.
[00:56:16.522 --> 00:56:17.803]  Anybody can research what I'm saying.
[00:56:17.803 --> 00:56:20.346]  And when I talked about this 20 years ago, it was weird and kooky.
[00:56:20.346 --> 00:56:21.447]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:56:21.447 --> 00:56:23.128]  People are like, well, humans are bad.
[00:56:23.128 --> 00:56:24.870]  Thank God the evolution's about to happen.
[00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:25.971]  We're all about to be killed.
[00:56:25.971 --> 00:56:27.252]  We're bad for the Earth.
[00:56:27.252 --> 00:56:29.734]  I'm like, okay, professor, kill yourself.
[00:56:29.734 --> 00:56:37.201]  Or okay, then stop bitching all day about, you know, how we're being mean to the dreamers when Mexico doesn't let people come there and be illegal like that.
[00:56:37.201 --> 00:56:39.803]  Oh, then you're all hurt selectively because it's all about
[00:56:40.649 --> 00:56:45.051]  Virtue signaling, not actually caring about humanity in the main.
[00:56:45.051 --> 00:56:46.112]  It's all about lies.
[00:56:46.112 --> 00:56:52.315]  It's all about dividing humanity.
[00:56:52.315 --> 00:56:52.495]  So...
[00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:59.066]  The way this is being deployed, even if there's accidents with it, it's going to get out of hand.
[00:56:59.066 --> 00:57:01.948]  And Congress is voting to legalize driverless cars everywhere.
[00:57:01.948 --> 00:57:03.508]  They're going to then pass laws and regulations.
[00:57:03.508 --> 00:57:04.409]  They're already saying it.
[00:57:04.409 --> 00:57:05.850]  I knew they'd do it years ago.
[00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:12.313]  And I said, watch, they'll claim humans are too dangerous and start taxing us and putting giant insurance costs on top of it.
[00:57:12.313 --> 00:57:15.854]  And then we'll be made obsolete by the cost, by the cars.
[00:57:15.854 --> 00:57:17.075]  You say, well, that's just the future.
[00:57:17.375 --> 00:57:27.022]  No it isn't because they're designing a future where we'll be removed from decision making and be removed from importance so we can be exited out of the door.
[00:57:27.022 --> 00:57:28.863]  The decision has been made!
[00:57:38.746 --> 00:57:42.347]  Because I saw it and I called his cell phone.
[00:57:42.347 --> 00:57:43.828]  So he's coming on to talk about it.
[00:57:43.828 --> 00:57:45.388]  But I mean, we're already in an AI.
[00:57:45.388 --> 00:57:50.630]  We're already in an artificial system that censors things and controls things behind their computer wall.
[00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:52.671]  We're already being abused.
[00:57:52.671 --> 00:57:58.313]  Amazon already knows before you order a product what you're going to order days before and already has it packaged.
[00:57:58.313 --> 00:57:58.773]  Remember that?
[00:58:00.365 --> 00:58:01.746]  It already knows your subconscious.
[00:58:01.746 --> 00:58:02.747]  It's tracking it.
[00:58:02.747 --> 00:58:03.728]  It sees the patterns.
[00:58:03.728 --> 00:58:05.229]  You don't consciously see it.
[00:58:05.229 --> 00:58:07.331]  It's tracking the patterns.
[00:58:07.331 --> 00:58:16.519]  That's why you need to support independent economies outside of the globalist arc, like InfoWarsTore.com, where SuperMetal Vitality is about to sell out.
[00:58:16.519 --> 00:58:18.321]  So we're going to have to cut the 57% off.
[00:58:18.321 --> 00:58:20.763]  We've never gone that low, but I want people to try it.
[00:58:20.763 --> 00:58:21.844]  SuperMetal Vitality.
[00:58:23.095 --> 00:58:25.075]  We also have 50% off on Emmerich Essentials.
[00:58:25.075 --> 00:58:30.597]  We also have 50% off right now on Caveman in chocolate and in strawberry.
[00:58:30.597 --> 00:58:31.737]  Please support the broadcast.
[00:58:31.737 --> 00:58:33.537]  Find out why these products are so great.
[00:58:33.537 --> 00:58:35.778]  X2 is also 57% off.
[00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:38.338]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:58:38.338 --> 00:58:39.679]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:39.679 --> 00:58:42.679]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:42.679 --> 00:58:43.740]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.238 --> 00:58:55.206]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:55.206 --> 00:58:57.288]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:58:57.288 --> 00:59:02.575]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:59:02.575 --> 00:59:06.100]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns.
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:09.861]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:59:09.861 --> 00:59:13.061]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:59:13.061 --> 00:59:16.922]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:59:16.922 --> 00:59:24.104]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:59:24.104 --> 00:59:30.225]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[00:59:30.405 --> 00:59:32.086]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:02.503 --> 01:00:04.604]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.604 --> 01:00:06.765]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.765 --> 01:00:10.027]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.027 --> 01:00:11.888]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.888 --> 01:00:13.789]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:20.092]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.484 --> 01:00:35.686]  Well, for the next 30 minutes, Ted Nugent is joining us and I really appreciate him joining us today.
[01:00:35.686 --> 01:00:46.769]  I was listening to Channel 38 on XM and I heard one of the talk show hosts going, you know, he's the best guitarist ever and we love him, but...
[01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:54.744]  You know, he's kind of wacky, Uncle Ted, claiming Facebook's censoring him, and he's really got twenty-something million, but they only show two million.
[01:00:54.744 --> 01:00:57.026]  Come on, you ought to be glad to have two million!
[01:00:57.026 --> 01:01:02.632]  And then I turned on the news that night, and, you know, heard somebody make a snarky comment, and I'm like, oh yeah, there's a hit piece out on Ted Nugent.
[01:01:03.436 --> 01:01:11.765]  I went and printed off, no exaggeration, like 50 mainstream news articles admitting Facebook is censoring conservatives and libertarians and working with the CIA to do it.
[01:01:11.765 --> 01:01:14.768]  That's the CIA that Obama still has people in there working with.
[01:01:14.768 --> 01:01:21.896]  So I wanted to talk about that, the state of the country, the Korea situation, the hurricane.
[01:01:21.896 --> 01:01:23.597]  Later this month he's going out to Okinawa.
[01:01:24.619 --> 01:01:26.020]  Well, I appreciate it, Alex.
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:31.344]  First of all, we'll keep the spirit ultra-buoyant and positive by saying happy hunting season across America, September 2017.
[01:01:43.903 --> 01:01:44.744]  Absolutely.
[01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:47.367]  This is a short segment, longer segment coming up.
[01:01:47.367 --> 01:01:56.296]  Just recapsulate what you were told about what's happened to your Facebook because I personally check it out all the time and I remember it had like 26 million one day.
[01:01:56.296 --> 01:02:00.141]  I was looking at it a few years ago and then I went back like a month later there was 2 million.
[01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:02.903]  I've never seen them jacked with somebody's Facebook like yours.
[01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:16.554]  Well, truth, logic, and common sense is what I represent, and the leftists, and the Antifa, and the electronic goofballs out there in charge of social media, they can't debate me.
[01:02:16.554 --> 01:02:18.134]  You know they can't debate me.
[01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:23.116]  They know they can't debate me because I've got all the evidence, all the history, all the facts, all the data.
[01:02:23.536 --> 01:02:23.716]  I don't
[01:02:40.928 --> 01:02:48.575]  I'm not going to tell you what he does.
[01:02:48.575 --> 01:03:02.286]  All I can tell you is that he knows everything about social media and all this technology, and he knows for a fact that I'm between 25 and 35 million reach on my Facebook, but Facebook only admits 3.5 million.
[01:03:02.286 --> 01:03:06.390]  So once again, the truth will get out there in spite of those that hate the truth.
[01:03:07.469 --> 01:03:08.170]  Absolutely.
[01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:21.959]  Well, I had them approach me a few years ago and say, buy advertising and we'll let you actually reach your fans who are trying to get there, but they're not putting, even though they sign up to want to see your post, my post, they're not letting our post get to them.
[01:03:21.959 --> 01:03:23.059]  So it's truly sickening.
[01:03:23.059 --> 01:03:30.624]  But as you said, there you are getting 25 million people responding, but then they're saying that you have way less than that.
[01:03:30.624 --> 01:03:34.427]  When that was just one story that had that, they're saying you have less than that in a month.
[01:03:35.302 --> 01:03:48.131]  You know, in those controversial moments, which you don't have to look very hard to find, they happen every few minutes with just the fake news outrage that has been attacking me for the last 45 plus years.
[01:03:48.131 --> 01:03:52.413]  I mean, the things they say about me, Alex, are just insane.
[01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:55.516]  They just pull stuff out of their ass and make stuff up every day.
[01:03:55.516 --> 01:03:56.596]  Same with me!
[01:03:56.596 --> 01:03:57.077]  Same with me!
[01:03:57.797 --> 01:03:58.598]  Yes, we are.
[01:04:16.681 --> 01:04:19.164]  Don't just do concerts and then order room service.
[01:04:19.164 --> 01:04:25.112]  I have meetings with the community every day, Alex, all my life, all my career.
[01:04:25.112 --> 01:04:33.743]  Hang out with cops and teachers and hardware store operators and pipeline CEOs and ranchers and welders and bow hunters.
[01:04:34.463 --> 01:04:36.225]  You've got your finger on the pulse of America.
[01:04:36.225 --> 01:04:37.926]  Ted Nugent, stay there.
[01:04:37.926 --> 01:04:39.707]  Let's talk about the censorship.
[01:04:39.707 --> 01:04:42.549]  I'll go over some mainstream news articles confirming you're right.
[01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:44.791]  And then I'm going to ask you, what do we do about this?
[01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:50.435]  Because, you know, these platforms operate as monopolies and they're trying to violate our civil rights.
[01:04:50.435 --> 01:04:54.498]  What do we do when we have voices to talk about the censorship that's getting so bad?
[01:04:56.149 --> 01:04:58.070]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[01:04:58.070 --> 01:04:59.991]  That all men are created equal.
[01:04:59.991 --> 01:05:03.674]  That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
[01:05:03.674 --> 01:05:07.116]  That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:05:07.116 --> 01:05:14.160]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:23.286]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[01:05:24.947 --> 01:05:26.748]  Independence isn't a day.
[01:05:26.748 --> 01:05:27.788]  It's a mindset.
[01:05:27.788 --> 01:05:30.550]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:32.150]  I will not be your slave.
[01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:38.213]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[01:05:38.213 --> 01:05:43.176]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:05:43.176 --> 01:05:45.076]  Slaves are never safe.
[01:05:45.076 --> 01:05:48.058]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:05:48.058 --> 01:05:49.158]  Guard your liberty.
[01:05:49.158 --> 01:05:52.520]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.401]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:05:56.112 --> 01:06:00.958]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:11.251]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[01:06:11.271 --> 01:06:20.517]  Infowars had much better nutrition than we do today, and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:06:20.517 --> 01:06:34.527]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:06:34.527 --> 01:06:36.909]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[01:06:36.909 --> 01:06:39.991]  We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face
[01:06:39.991 --> 01:06:40.431]  We're good.
[01:06:56.013 --> 01:07:04.755]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:07:04.755 --> 01:07:05.295]  That's right.
[01:07:05.295 --> 01:07:10.556]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.

[01:07:24.838 --> 01:07:25.058]  Woo!
[01:07:25.058 --> 01:07:26.099]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:26.099 --> 01:07:34.824]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:07:34.824 --> 01:07:44.430]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:47.872]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:07:47.872 --> 01:07:51.974]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:07:51.974 --> 01:07:52.835]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:07:53.035 --> 01:08:06.318]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:08:06.318 --> 01:08:14.160]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.802]  And the rock and roll anthem, Stranglehold.
[01:08:19.802 --> 01:08:32.492]  By one of the greatest guitarists ever, the Motor City Madman who spends his time between Michigan, beautiful country, just up there last year doing some hunting, and good old Texas.
[01:08:32.492 --> 01:08:34.773]  Ted Nugent's with us till the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:34.773 --> 01:08:40.077]  Now again, the reason I called him this weekend, he was gracious to come on on short notice, is I listen to...
[01:08:41.704 --> 01:08:51.193]  Some of the channels on XM, and I like Heavy Rock, which now Liberal Homeland Security in Canada has said is a sign that you're a racist hate monger.
[01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:53.115]  That's mainstream news today, but seriously.
[01:08:54.313 --> 01:09:00.858]  I like listening to Ted Nugent, so I was literally tuning in to hear something like Ted Nugent, and I hear the host making fun of Ted.
[01:09:00.858 --> 01:09:06.102]  Ted's the best guitarist ever, always so wonderful, got a bunch of Ted Nugent coming up, but he claims he's being censored.
[01:09:06.102 --> 01:09:07.764]  Everybody knows that's not happening.
[01:09:07.764 --> 01:09:16.631]  Well, I just happened to print more than 50 mainstream news articles, and while he's talking, I'm just going to be showing them for the TV audience, but here's a few for radio.
[01:09:16.631 --> 01:09:21.975]  Facebook trending news excludes Drudge Report, Breitbart, InfoWars, and they admit they are.
[01:09:23.151 --> 01:09:24.333]  Here's the hill.
[01:09:24.333 --> 01:09:28.540]  Report Facebook omit conservative topics from trending list.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.421]  Gizmodo.
[01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:32.446]  Former Facebook workers we routinely suppress conservative news.
[01:09:33.993 --> 01:09:40.879]  Social media giant organizing trust and safety council with Islamist and feminist to censor conservative news sites.
[01:09:40.879 --> 01:09:41.840]  That's right.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.762]  Jihad Watch has been banned off PayPal.
[01:09:43.762 --> 01:09:50.248]  They're trying to ban us right now, but actual jihad groups with Linda Saussure can be on there.
[01:09:50.248 --> 01:09:53.150]  Facebook blacklist trending news stories daily.
[01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:54.672]  Contractors say.
[01:09:54.672 --> 01:09:57.774]  Facebook bans conservatives for complaining about censorship.
[01:09:57.774 --> 01:09:59.856]  Facebook to decide what's real versus fake news.
[01:10:00.777 --> 01:10:03.599]  Facebook now last week bans conservative advertising.
[01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:09.022]  Soros finances group helping Facebook flag disputed stories.
[01:10:09.022 --> 01:10:12.083]  This is Associated Press, Reuters, New York Times.
[01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:16.566]  Senator demands answers from Facebook on claims of trending list bans.
[01:10:16.566 --> 01:10:19.247]  So there's now investigations in Congress about this.
[01:10:19.247 --> 01:10:29.353]  I'm going to stop right there because I don't want to waste our time we've got with Ted Nugent here, but I want to defend him because on TV and radio this weekend, and I'm not a big consumer of TV and radio,
[01:10:30.703 --> 01:10:33.945]  I heard him being trashed because there's a talking point out.
[01:10:33.945 --> 01:10:43.272]  They don't want somebody, one of the top rock stars ever, sold out shows everywhere, loved across the board, hundreds of millions of fans on the internet, to have...
[01:10:44.471 --> 01:10:46.593]  His word, you know, out there about being censored.
[01:10:46.593 --> 01:10:50.637]  They want to make a joke about it to discredit everybody when they admit they're censoring.
[01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:52.959]  So that's why this is a big deal.
[01:10:52.959 --> 01:10:54.140]  It is happening.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.362]  And we're going to discuss it.
[01:10:55.362 --> 01:10:56.663]  Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[01:10:56.663 --> 01:10:58.965]  They're all censoring libertarians, conservatives.
[01:10:58.965 --> 01:11:01.047]  They've been censoring Trump's Twitter feed.
[01:11:01.047 --> 01:11:01.808]  Drudge!
[01:11:01.808 --> 01:11:03.189]  They've been calling his...
[01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:11.139]  Information inappropriate when it's links to jobs numbers and stuff or to NASA reporting on an asteroid.
[01:11:11.139 --> 01:11:13.442]  They are censoring all of us at an alarming rate.
[01:11:13.442 --> 01:11:14.964]  They admit they are.
[01:11:14.964 --> 01:11:17.027]  So, Ted Nugent, what do we do about it?
[01:11:17.952 --> 01:11:20.973]  Well, you do what I do, and what you do, you raise hell.
[01:11:20.973 --> 01:11:29.034]  You know, I've talked about this so many times before, but the media is so infested with anti-Americanism.
[01:11:29.034 --> 01:11:41.016]  They literally scoff and mock at me and you and the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and those great American rednecks that saved all those people in Corpus Christi in Houston and in Louisiana.
[01:11:41.016 --> 01:11:42.696]  I just wrote another article.
[01:11:42.696 --> 01:11:46.897]  I write for a dozen or so publications, including Deer and DeerHunting.com.
[01:11:47.757 --> 01:12:09.242]  Now, if everybody would think about that, deer and deerhunting.com, I weave in the politics that is the tip of the culture war spear, which is anti-gun, anti-hunting, anti-independence, anti-rugged individualism, and those are the people that saved all those people in the Harvey aftermath, and in fact, it's still going on.
[01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.783]  Those are duck hunters, those are deer hunters, those are NRG hunters.
[01:12:11.783 --> 01:12:12.143]  I think so.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.180]  I think so.
[01:12:47.601 --> 01:12:49.804]  Only after I'm done with the interview.
[01:12:49.804 --> 01:13:04.799]  They never challenge me when I'm on the air with them, because they know I'll eat them alive, because I've got all the facts, all the data, all the history, all the current and historical information to make my point, because it's not my point.
[01:13:04.799 --> 01:13:07.542]  It's self-evident truth, logic and common sense.
[01:13:07.882 --> 01:13:22.874]  Which the mainstream media is allergic to, so we the people, individuals, have to constantly hammer our elected employees to remind them to get the Trump agenda accomplished.
[01:13:22.874 --> 01:13:26.998]  You and I talked many years ago that the number one curse in America was not
[01:13:27.478 --> 01:13:28.439]  We're good to go.
[01:13:45.792 --> 01:13:51.054]  Ultimately, constitutional accountability from our elected employees.
[01:13:51.054 --> 01:14:00.156]  So the real curse in America isn't the enemy that's winning in media and academia and too often in government, even though now we've got the right administration.
[01:14:00.156 --> 01:14:01.437]  Boy, we could talk about that.
[01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:04.978]  Those are all my guys with Trump.
[01:14:04.978 --> 01:14:09.639]  Those are all real American working hard, playing hard, constitutionalists.
[01:14:09.639 --> 01:14:11.920]  But we the people, each individual American,
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.481]  Wow, Ted Nugent is on fire as usual.
[01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:14.642]  When is he not in Fuego?
[01:14:14.642 --> 01:14:18.225]  We have several videos we shot in Austin last week, in Houston and in Austin.
[01:14:42.628 --> 01:14:48.991]  Where, and some of these videos have like 10, 12, 14 million views a piece because it's so incredible.
[01:14:48.991 --> 01:14:54.553]  We show the loving, caring people of all race, colors and creeds coming together in Houston.
[01:14:54.553 --> 01:15:00.656]  And then we show the protesters against Trump coming that the media kind of ignored because they knew this looked bad.
[01:15:00.656 --> 01:15:02.517]  And they are the most hateful, evil,
[01:15:03.377 --> 01:15:30.307]  Vicious people and then we've had reporters in the situation in Virginia three weeks ago and out in San Francisco when the Antifa shows up throwing feces, urine, beating people, attacking folks and Trump says hey the white supremacists are bad but so is the Antifa and the media says he's evil and wrong but now three weeks later Pelosi and all of them have had to come out and admit
[01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:36.958]  That indeed it's true and Antifa has now been listed as a terrorist organization.
[01:15:36.958 --> 01:15:42.968]  So they've absolutely had to eat crow and admit that Trump was right when he came out and said, yeah, both sides were wrong.
[01:15:43.917 --> 01:15:49.499]  And Alex, that's the manifestation of what I just said is what we're supposed to do.
[01:15:49.499 --> 01:15:52.340]  Believe me, Pelosi is the enemy.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.202]  Maxine Waters, I don't even know what planet she's from.
[01:15:55.202 --> 01:16:03.745]  I mean, the Democrats, the left, the liberals, these are strange, bizarre, anti-logic, anti-American freaks.
[01:16:04.285 --> 01:16:04.866]  I think so.
[01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:23.060]  I don't know.
[01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:42.445]  We're good to go.
[01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:07.202]  Exactly.
[01:17:07.202 --> 01:17:08.143]  How big of a victory?
[01:17:08.143 --> 01:17:09.623]  Because Trump didn't do a victory lap.
[01:17:09.623 --> 01:17:11.084]  He was too busy with Hurricane Harvey.
[01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:13.685]  And I follow your Facebook.
[01:17:13.685 --> 01:17:14.985]  I saw you did a few posts on it.
[01:17:14.985 --> 01:17:25.229]  But as libertarians, as conservatives, there's just common sense, Americana, like you say, working hard, playing hard, red-blooded, you know, humans who aren't sissies and who aren't trying to be victims.
[01:17:25.729 --> 01:17:27.011]  We have kind of a problem, though.
[01:17:27.011 --> 01:17:31.858]  We always get proven right, we keep moving forward, and we never double back and say, see, we were right.
[01:17:31.858 --> 01:17:33.420]  We just did it there.
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:36.684]  But I think more and more, we've got to kind of point out to folks that, listen!
[01:17:37.728 --> 01:17:41.829]  Listen, you know, folks promoting Americana know what we're talking about.
[01:17:41.829 --> 01:17:47.330]  You want to live in North Korea, you want to live in Venezuela, get your ass down there, stop bitching and complaining.
[01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:52.151]  Why do Pelosi and Michael Moore want to mount America's head on the wall?
[01:17:52.151 --> 01:18:04.334]  Why do they in their own internal documents, more of them come out in emails talking about how much they hate America and hate God and hate prosperity and Hillary calls her supporters dumb basement dwellers and talks about how they want free stuff.
[01:18:04.614 --> 01:18:06.194]  Well, lady, that's what you advertise!
[01:18:06.194 --> 01:18:08.595]  You know, at least we tell folks, don't try to get free stuff.
[01:18:08.595 --> 01:18:09.795]  Nothing's ever free.
[01:18:09.795 --> 01:18:14.676]  She says she's got free stuff, and then hates her own poor constituents!
[01:18:14.676 --> 01:18:20.237]  Well, that's why your spotlight on the cockroaches, Alec, is so important.
[01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:27.539]  That's really what we, the people, that's what our job is, as experimenters and self-government, to spotlight the cockroaches.
[01:18:27.539 --> 01:18:31.080]  You've perfected that over the years, and in my own little guitar-playing world,
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:39.630]  I mean, I just wrapped up the greatest tour of my life with the most amazing music and the band and the crowd and my crew.
[01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:41.993]  Every night was just phenomenal.
[01:18:41.993 --> 01:18:42.533]  All summer.
[01:18:42.533 --> 01:18:48.861]  And now I'm taking it to Okinawa for the ultimate rock and roll concert for the United States Marine Corps.
[01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:50.283]  Just downwind of Yong'un.
[01:18:51.184 --> 01:18:55.266]  I don't know what was the push there, but you're absolutely correct.
[01:18:55.266 --> 01:19:10.335]  The manifestation of a cultural deprivation is the fact that the spotlight has finally hit the right cockroach, because Donald Trump represents a crowbar upside the head of status quo politics.
[01:19:10.335 --> 01:19:12.956]  He represents the lights coming on at midnight.
[01:19:12.956 --> 01:19:14.757]  The lights are coming on, absolutely.
[01:19:14.757 --> 01:19:15.798]  That's what our job is.
[01:19:17.435 --> 01:19:20.397]  Look, I don't want to toot your horn, but this is real strategy.
[01:19:20.397 --> 01:19:29.564]  You on the NRA board were able to get a more hardcore and more like Gunners America, and you were somebody that pushed for that, and now the NRA is more amazing than ever.
[01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:31.926]  Best organization on earth, in my view.
[01:19:31.926 --> 01:19:44.576]  But there are a lot of folks in conservative that still get intimidated by kind of the mainline neocon or rhino stuff that, oh, Ted Nugent's a little extreme, oh, Alex Jones, he's way extreme, then they misquote who we are.
[01:19:44.576 --> 01:19:46.037]  But if they really pay attention,
[01:19:47.293 --> 01:19:50.114]  You, more than anybody, you said you're a little corner of a guitar.
[01:19:50.114 --> 01:20:08.360]  You are, other than Trump and a Nigel Farage or a Ron Paul, you have to certainly sit with Libertarians or myself, I mean there's only five or six, seven big guys that are out front and you, before Trump came along, were the biggest standard bearer for conservative, libertarian, Americana.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.520]  A god, guns and guts.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.081]  It's just a fact.
[01:20:11.721 --> 01:20:12.662]  I don't mince words.
[01:20:12.662 --> 01:20:13.642]  I don't play games.
[01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:16.804]  I know that I don't have to defend my right to hunt.
[01:20:16.804 --> 01:20:17.744]  I celebrate it.
[01:20:17.744 --> 01:20:20.766]  I don't have to defend my right to keep and bear arms.
[01:20:20.766 --> 01:20:23.067]  I promote it and celebrate it.
[01:20:23.067 --> 01:20:28.549]  The NRA will tell you that the reason I get more votes than any member of the Board of Directors, pretty much 90% of them,
[01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:31.011]  And that's where I was going!
[01:20:31.011 --> 01:20:36.435]  That's where I was going, is that it's people like you and Charlton Heston that made us what we are today, that took us over this hump,
[01:21:00.130 --> 01:21:18.196]  Where we have a fighting chance against the collectivist, and then to sit there and watch kind of the establishment Republicans act like you're an outsider, Trump's an outsider, when you and others have brought them Congress, the Awakening, the guys in the duck boats, all of us together, and then to still have the blue blood Republicans, the country club Republicans, looking down their noses at us,
[01:21:18.556 --> 01:21:28.142]  When you are the guy that reformed the NRA, you're the guy that we can really owe for probably turning the whole Second Amendment battle around, that and Charlton Heston before you, who I know you work closely with.
[01:21:28.142 --> 01:21:38.209]  So that said, I'm asking you to really realize that I understand you're self-deprecating and you don't want to toot your own horn, but Ted, other than Trump,
[01:21:39.149 --> 01:21:52.056]  You're one of the main leaders out there, so I'm just asking you to use that great brain you've got to think of what you can do more to general people into being more aggressive so that the weak-kneed Republicans don't basically win the day.
[01:21:52.056 --> 01:21:54.297]  I'm asking you the same thing I did ten years ago.
[01:21:54.297 --> 01:21:56.118]  I said, please get in there and kick some ass at the NRA.
[01:21:56.118 --> 01:21:58.079]  And it's not that I asked you so you did it.
[01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.160]  A lot of folks were doing it.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.121]  But I'm saying, you cleaned up the NRA.
[01:22:01.121 --> 01:22:02.402]  Can you help us clean up the Republicans?
[01:22:03.624 --> 01:22:04.264]  Absolutely!
[01:22:04.264 --> 01:22:05.665]  I see it happening all the time.
[01:22:05.665 --> 01:22:12.647]  I was with a gal on Fox Television last week, a couple weeks ago, when I was wrapping up the tour of New York City.
[01:22:12.647 --> 01:22:16.828]  And her name is Lena Epstein.
[01:22:16.828 --> 01:22:18.588]  And she's a hellraiser.
[01:22:18.588 --> 01:22:23.270]  And she understands that we've got to get back to the brass tacks.
[01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:26.231]  We've got to get back to the right to keep and bear arms.
[01:22:26.231 --> 01:22:27.371]  Not to be infringed.
[01:22:27.371 --> 01:22:30.892]  We don't need any government paperwork for our First Amendment.
[01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:35.097]  And we sure as hell shouldn't need any government paperwork for our Second Amendment.
[01:22:35.097 --> 01:22:37.339]  I don't need a permit to carry a gun.
[01:22:37.339 --> 01:22:40.543]  I got that right from God and the Constitution guarantees it.
[01:22:40.543 --> 01:22:42.525]  That's all the permits I need.
[01:22:42.525 --> 01:22:50.614]  And this kind of gal should be running against Debbie Stabenow, one of Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters' buddies, here in the once reliably blue state of Michigan.
[01:22:50.614 --> 01:22:51.836]  How embarrassing can you get?
[01:22:52.456 --> 01:22:52.757]  We're good.
[01:23:12.418 --> 01:23:15.820]  We stand up and we demand constitutional accountability.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.981]  And I see that hell-raising increasing all the time, Alex.
[01:23:18.981 --> 01:23:22.222]  And you certainly were a leader on that front, and we salute you for that.
[01:23:22.222 --> 01:23:29.025]  Because to be an extremist, to be a radical, are like those Americans who went to Concord Bridge when the British were to take our guns.
[01:23:29.025 --> 01:23:32.526]  And we didn't sit down and have tea with them, we shot them in the damn head!
[01:23:32.526 --> 01:23:33.327]  We killed them!
[01:23:33.327 --> 01:23:36.228]  You come to take away our guns, we'll cut you in half!
[01:23:36.568 --> 01:23:38.189]  Somebody write that down!
[01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:45.832]  And that's the battle cry that's going to get all of our rights back, that's going to get rugged individualism back, self-sufficiency, real independence.
[01:23:45.832 --> 01:23:49.354]  We don't want to take stuff, we want to provide stuff.
[01:23:49.354 --> 01:24:02.960]  And that's the new battle cry that Donald Trump represents, and Mad Dog Mattis, and Zinke, and the entire staff of President Obama are the guys that I would share a hunting campfire with, literally.
[01:24:04.338 --> 01:24:11.468]  You imagine having Obama, you know, Obama sent this letter, I don't know if you've seen it, to Trump back in January and now leaked it.
[01:24:11.468 --> 01:24:14.532]  So it's a private letter, so he leaks it, how classy.
[01:24:14.532 --> 01:24:18.757]  And in it he says, listen, your job is to sustain the world government order.
[01:24:18.757 --> 01:24:21.140]  He actually says, your job is to keep
[01:24:21.661 --> 01:24:24.844]  The international order in place and that America's only part of it.
[01:24:24.844 --> 01:24:26.045]  What a treasonous letter.
[01:24:26.045 --> 01:24:34.913]  And that's why they're so upset that Trump's had success with the stock market and had success with new jobs and is turning the economy around with a 3.0 growth rate.
[01:24:34.913 --> 01:24:38.537]  Something they said Trump could never do because Obama never did it.
[01:24:39.813 --> 01:24:41.894]  Well, and the writing is on the wall.
[01:24:41.894 --> 01:24:59.926]  If you look at my wonderful birth city of Detroit, it was the work ethic epicenter, the productivity epicenter of the globe when I was born in 1948 until Mayor Coleman Young and the Liberal Democrats took over and trained people, brainwashed people, desold the people that you don't have to try.
[01:24:59.926 --> 01:25:06.551]  You just stay home or you go ahead and make Chrysler products that won't even run and will still send you a bonus check.
[01:25:06.551 --> 01:25:09.753]  But when you give people something, you turn them into
[01:25:09.753 --> 01:25:11.714]  That's the Donald Trump Army and I'm proud to be a part of it.
[01:25:37.975 --> 01:25:38.355]  Absolutely.
[01:25:38.355 --> 01:25:53.119]  I don't know if you saw this, but Phil Mudd, a big Democrat and a guy appointed to the FBI Deputy Directorship from the CIA by Obama, he came out on CNN a month ago and said, we're going to kill Trump.
[01:25:53.119 --> 01:25:53.699]  That's a quote.
[01:25:53.699 --> 01:25:54.799]  We're going to kill him.
[01:25:54.799 --> 01:26:04.262]  And there's all this talk about removing him outside of impeachment and all this talk at high levels about trying to claim that he's mentally ill or something.
[01:26:04.262 --> 01:26:05.022]  What do you make of that?
[01:26:06.707 --> 01:26:08.369]  Well, I've been dealing with these freaks.
[01:26:08.369 --> 01:26:17.422]  I mean, we've always heightened our security on tour because people have threatened to kill me because I murder innocent animals.
[01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:18.964]  I don't even know what to make of that.
[01:26:18.964 --> 01:26:20.546]  Your brain's got to be 90% LSD to think.
[01:26:23.650 --> 01:26:28.913]  That murdering innocent animals is what we do to feed the human species.
[01:26:28.913 --> 01:26:31.774]  That's like so bizarre, I just laughed at it.
[01:26:31.774 --> 01:26:46.222]  However, these freaks are serious and they threaten to kill our family because we hunt, because we believe in the Second Amendment, because we trounce and spotlight the cockroaches on the left that hate America, hate the Constitution, hate the American dream, hate independence.
[01:26:46.222 --> 01:26:47.263]  Why do they hate it?
[01:26:47.263 --> 01:26:48.243]  Why do they hate it?
[01:26:48.243 --> 01:26:48.623]  Why?
[01:26:48.623 --> 01:26:49.384]  What's their problem?
[01:26:50.618 --> 01:26:53.340]  I gotta tell you, Alex, I grew up with these people.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:54.982]  I'll be 69 in a couple months.
[01:26:54.982 --> 01:27:00.588]  And I grew up with these people who are running the media that are entrenched in the government right now.
[01:27:00.588 --> 01:27:02.670]  These are dope smokers.
[01:27:02.670 --> 01:27:04.933]  They make no sense!
[01:27:05.433 --> 01:27:25.158]  Their logic meter is pinned in the off position, that you listen to Al Franken talk, you listen to Bill Maher talk, you watch Nancy Pelosi try to form a syllable, and you've got to know that these people are brain dead and they're in it for their own selfish reasons.
[01:27:25.158 --> 01:27:29.359]  Look at Maxine Waters, she has how many mansions and she represents
[01:27:29.719 --> 01:27:30.200]  We're good.
[01:27:47.756 --> 01:27:48.056]  We're good.
[01:28:07.381 --> 01:28:10.163]  It's pretty obvious, unless you're one of them.
[01:28:10.163 --> 01:28:20.071]  And that's why Donald Trump represents a complete sucker punch into the status quo of the entrenched politics that has ruined everything in this country.
[01:28:20.071 --> 01:28:22.633]  And we were talking during the break, and I gotta go, please come back soon.
[01:28:22.633 --> 01:28:25.015]  We were talking about the media, the lies they say about you, about me.
[01:28:25.015 --> 01:28:31.520]  Folks, you've gotta know, you hear something about Ted Nugent or anybody else that's a patriot, you need to see the video for yourself.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.142]  Don't just believe it when they put it in print.
[01:28:33.142 --> 01:28:35.644]  You were telling me some amazing lies they put out against you.
[01:28:36.949 --> 01:28:38.029]  It's just astonishing.
[01:28:38.029 --> 01:28:40.310]  They constantly say that I dodged the draft.
[01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:41.571]  I didn't dodge the draft.
[01:28:41.571 --> 01:28:48.693]  I did an interview with some stone freak for High Times Magazine, and I referenced the story of my drummer, K.J.
[01:28:48.693 --> 01:28:53.395]  Knight, who's a dear friend of mine, who went through all kinds of fall to roll to avoid the draft.
[01:28:53.395 --> 01:28:55.375]  It was so damn funny back then.
[01:28:55.375 --> 01:28:57.176]  I gave that story to High Times because
[01:28:58.096 --> 01:29:00.941]  Alex, they never got the band members' names right.
[01:29:00.941 --> 01:29:02.583]  They never got the instruments right.
[01:29:02.583 --> 01:29:04.305]  They never got the song titles right.
[01:29:04.305 --> 01:29:05.948]  They never got the date right.
[01:29:05.948 --> 01:29:07.610]  They never got the facility right.
[01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:09.673]  They were all stoned idiots!
[01:29:09.673 --> 01:29:14.280]  And that old lie, that first lie, gets regurgitated more and more like it's true.
[01:29:15.868 --> 01:29:16.529]  Absolutely.
[01:29:16.529 --> 01:29:19.973]  Listen, I couldn't have avoided the draft.
[01:29:19.973 --> 01:29:22.195]  I was Superman when I was 19 years old.
[01:29:22.195 --> 01:29:28.062]  I used to, literally, I'm not making this up, I would hurdle Volkswagens just to show off.
[01:29:28.062 --> 01:29:31.546]  I was so athletic and so wired, I was already a sniper.
[01:29:31.546 --> 01:29:34.269]  Ted, I know you've got to go, but I want you to be able to finish this.
[01:29:34.269 --> 01:29:36.291]  If you've got to go, I understand, but can you do five more minutes with us?
[01:29:37.102 --> 01:29:38.103]  I can, absolutely.
[01:29:38.103 --> 01:29:39.084]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:39.084 --> 01:29:40.746]  Ted Nugent, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:40.746 --> 01:29:42.828]  We were talking about some of the stuff they've claimed about him.
[01:29:42.828 --> 01:29:44.650]  It just shows who they are.
[01:29:44.650 --> 01:29:46.052]  We're on the march.
[01:29:46.052 --> 01:29:47.514]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.514 --> 01:29:49.055]  That's right, the communist empire's on the run.
[01:29:49.055 --> 01:29:51.278]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.038 --> 01:30:03.039]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[01:30:03.039 --> 01:30:08.520]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.861]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[01:30:11.861 --> 01:30:14.222]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[01:30:14.222 --> 01:30:19.563]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[01:30:19.563 --> 01:30:21.143]  That is the ultimate concern.
[01:30:21.403 --> 01:30:27.566]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[01:30:27.566 --> 01:30:30.068]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[01:30:30.068 --> 01:30:34.370]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:39.112]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[01:30:39.112 --> 01:30:44.495]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[01:30:44.495 --> 01:30:49.538]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[01:30:49.838 --> 01:30:53.542]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[01:30:53.542 --> 01:30:55.385]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.

[01:31:57.424 --> 01:32:01.187]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:32:01.187 --> 01:32:08.932]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:32:08.932 --> 01:32:17.538]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:32:17.538 --> 01:32:27.124]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:32:27.544 --> 01:32:31.787]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:32:31.787 --> 01:32:35.209]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:46.337]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:32:46.337 --> 01:32:49.259]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:32:49.259 --> 01:32:55.243]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:33:05.592 --> 01:33:12.258]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:12.258 --> 01:33:16.062]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.062 --> 01:33:20.486]  You know, that liner is many years old, but now that we have Trump as president, we have a beachhead.
[01:33:20.486 --> 01:33:23.449]  If we keep taking the country back, I'll have to change all my liners.
[01:33:23.449 --> 01:33:28.854]  But you saw Texas, it isn't perfect, but Texans are known to respond to disasters and known to shoot you straight.
[01:33:31.596 --> 01:33:39.221]  Look, there's those type of values from Northern California, to Michigan, to Illinois, to Florida, to Georgia, to New York City.
[01:33:39.221 --> 01:33:48.567]  It's the media bullying everybody to be afraid to say, we're just patriots, we love America, we love free market, we don't want to live in North Korea.
[01:33:48.567 --> 01:33:55.552]  Ted Nugent's with us a few more minutes, breaking down all the things that are happening in our country, in our world.
[01:33:55.552 --> 01:34:01.076]  How long can this media bullying continue when it's blowing up in their face everywhere?
[01:34:01.956 --> 01:34:10.959]  Well, it's deeply entrenched as a direct result of the dope smoke of the 60s and 70s, where that generation is now in charge of the fake news monster out there.
[01:34:10.959 --> 01:34:16.501]  But I gotta tell you, on a positive note, we know that there's always going to be good, bad, and ugly.
[01:34:16.501 --> 01:34:21.963]  And it's important to maximize the good by identifying and going after the bad and the ugly.
[01:34:21.963 --> 01:34:22.883]  And I just wrapped up
[01:34:23.423 --> 01:34:27.466]  In 2017, Alex, I'm going to be 69 years old.
[01:34:27.466 --> 01:34:33.991]  I had the greatest, most musically outrageous and adventurous fun tour of my life.
[01:34:33.991 --> 01:34:46.681]  And when we play across California, when we play across New York and New Jersey and Maryland and Massachusetts, Illinois, when you play what they think are blue states, there are no blue states.
[01:34:48.135 --> 01:35:04.686]  America is 50 states red, but you have high-crime, Democrat-run, blue smudges, and wherever this hardcore, redneck, right-wing, Ted Nugent, NRA border director for 26 years guy rocks out,
[01:35:05.286 --> 01:35:12.151]  People in California, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, all these so-called blue states.
[01:35:12.151 --> 01:35:14.673]  It's like a homecoming, Alex.
[01:35:14.673 --> 01:35:17.454]  I can't find a liberal animal rights freak.
[01:35:17.454 --> 01:35:21.337]  Of course, they part like the Red Sea before Moses when I come to town.
[01:35:21.337 --> 01:35:25.360]  They're scared to death of me, even though they threaten to kill me on the social media.
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:29.803]  They haven't got the balls or the capability to confront me in person.
[01:35:29.803 --> 01:35:34.066]  The bottom line is, there's so much constitutional
[01:35:34.486 --> 01:35:35.427]  We're good to go.
[01:35:55.066 --> 01:35:56.486]  We're good to go.
[01:36:12.812 --> 01:36:32.345]  The people like you and me, people who bust their ass to be in the asset column every day, until we put enough pressure on the media that we're not going to listen to their crap anymore, and we're not going to put up with Antifa and Black Lives Matter terrorists anymore, until that time comes, we're going to have to deal with them.
[01:36:32.345 --> 01:36:33.766]  But let me just tell everybody.
[01:36:35.427 --> 01:36:36.087]  I don't know.
[01:36:55.288 --> 01:36:56.429]  What you're saying is this.
[01:36:56.429 --> 01:36:57.669]  Stop being intimidated.
[01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:58.550]  We're in a war.
[01:36:58.550 --> 01:37:00.971]  They're always, Ted Nugent, stop saying it's a war.
[01:37:00.971 --> 01:37:02.792]  Stephen Bannon, stop saying it's a war.
[01:37:02.792 --> 01:37:04.393]  Alex Jones, stop calling it an info war.
[01:37:04.393 --> 01:37:06.514]  It's a war!
[01:37:06.514 --> 01:37:06.994]  Exactly.
[01:37:06.994 --> 01:37:11.376]  They want us to stop telling the truth because they're in war against us.
[01:37:11.376 --> 01:37:12.277]  Look at the WikiLeaks!
[01:37:13.615 --> 01:37:14.195]  Yeah, it's pretty.
[01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:16.576]  All I can tell you, Alex, you're doing God's work.
[01:37:16.576 --> 01:37:20.138]  And spotlighting cockroaches is one of my greatest sports in the world.
[01:37:20.138 --> 01:37:22.138]  That's what the founding fathers wanted.
[01:37:22.138 --> 01:37:26.700]  The founding fathers wanted everybody to be like Ted Nugent and Alex Jones.
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:28.461]  To question authority.
[01:37:28.461 --> 01:37:33.843]  To question and demand constitutional accountability from all elected employees.
[01:37:33.843 --> 01:37:37.484]  Hell, just the fact that I came up with the term elected employees.
[01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:38.785]  They're not elected officials.
[01:37:39.305 --> 01:37:43.711]  And like you do, support the good employees with our full backing.
[01:37:43.711 --> 01:37:47.837]  The other part of the question, so in closing, because you've got to go I know, I wanted to hit two more topics.
[01:37:47.837 --> 01:37:51.101]  You're being censored, I'm being censored, they admit they're censoring.
[01:37:51.101 --> 01:37:54.165]  As a group, Libertarian Conservatives, Congressman Rohrabacher.
[01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:57.408]  Others are saying this is racketeering.
[01:37:57.408 --> 01:37:59.589]  This is civil rights violations.
[01:37:59.589 --> 01:38:05.693]  You know, imagine if they didn't let blacks, you know, publish, you know, letters to the editor.
[01:38:05.693 --> 01:38:08.375]  That's what's happening to conservatives across the board.
[01:38:08.375 --> 01:38:09.095]  It's very evil.
[01:38:09.095 --> 01:38:15.780]  So thank you for speaking out about Facebook blocking you from your own internal IT, which we've experienced, which they admit they're doing.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:24.826]  But that's why people need to visit TedNugent.com and make it their homepage or InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com or DrudgeReport.com.
[01:38:25.606 --> 01:38:29.948]  Whoever you go to, there's safety in numbers, we're growing, but we're in a real war.
[01:38:29.948 --> 01:38:32.809]  They are blocking us sharing our Facebook post.
[01:38:32.809 --> 01:38:35.770]  We can post it to our page, but it doesn't get to you.
[01:38:35.770 --> 01:38:38.150]  97% reduction.
[01:38:38.150 --> 01:38:41.331]  They don't let us share the articles.
[01:38:41.331 --> 01:38:42.412]  And then they force feed.
[01:38:43.312 --> 01:38:50.217]  Zuckerberg and his anti-gun, open borders, globalism to all three billion people or whatever, are on Facebook.
[01:38:50.217 --> 01:38:59.584]  So just understand, TedNugent.com, Infowars.com, people need to know, yes, we're on these sites that are censoring us because they're big, they're important, we're fighting.
[01:38:59.584 --> 01:39:03.187]  But we've got to have our own home bases that are supported.
[01:39:03.187 --> 01:39:04.288]  Your comments on that, Ted?
[01:39:05.114 --> 01:39:07.195]  Well, number one, a thank to everybody out there.
[01:39:07.195 --> 01:39:11.176]  I know they're listening to your show right now, Alex, because I posted on my Facebook.
[01:39:11.176 --> 01:39:21.099]  But if you want to feel the heart and soul of positive constitutional Bill of Rights, Ten Commandments, Golden Rule, be the best that you can be, America, come to my Facebook.
[01:39:21.099 --> 01:39:22.240]  I don't know what the address is.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:22.920]  Facebook.com.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.901]  Everybody knows Ted Nugent Facebook.
[01:39:24.901 --> 01:39:25.721]  Ted Nugent Facebook.
[01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:31.110]  Yeah, but bottom line is, you'll see that common sense is alive and well out there.
[01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:35.834]  The work ethic that makes this country the greatest quality of life in the world is alive and well.
[01:39:35.834 --> 01:39:43.341]  And I want to thank everybody who does come to my Facebook and comes to my website, because that positive energy is indefatigable.
[01:39:43.801 --> 01:39:44.482]  That's right.
[01:39:44.482 --> 01:39:45.302]  Take action.
[01:40:11.544 --> 01:40:11.864]  That's right.
[01:40:11.864 --> 01:40:17.329]  Don't think that you can run around and save the world overnight so you don't do anything.
[01:40:17.329 --> 01:40:17.790]  No.
[01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:20.752]  Folks, every little bit together, many hands make light work.
[01:40:20.752 --> 01:40:23.074]  Final point with Ted Nugent.
[01:40:23.074 --> 01:40:24.195]  This is out of the Daily Caller.
[01:40:24.195 --> 01:40:25.637]  I went to the Democratic Party groups.
[01:40:25.637 --> 01:40:27.458]  It's true.
[01:40:27.458 --> 01:40:29.080]  Also, The Washington Times is reporting it.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:41.512]  Anti-Trump resistance groups spreading North Korean propaganda and then I found The Hill today blames Trump for the North Korea crisis and even misquotes Putin criticizing Trump.
[01:40:41.512 --> 01:40:44.896]  We went to the actual quote, Putin didn't even say Trump.
[01:40:44.896 --> 01:40:50.542]  So what do you make of our own, I mean these traitors, now siding against America with North Korea?
[01:40:51.334 --> 01:40:58.858]  Well, certainly I'm glad the term fake news has finally been documented because I've been dealing with it for the last 45, 50 years.
[01:40:58.858 --> 01:41:00.519]  But it's fake news.
[01:41:00.519 --> 01:41:16.689]  And if you know about the rules for radicals and the Saul Alinsky that tutored Hillary Clinton so she could write her law degree thesis at Columbia under the teachings of Saul Alinsky, that's the rules for radicals.
[01:41:16.689 --> 01:41:20.111]  They have to lie because they know that if America
[01:41:20.131 --> 01:41:20.631]  We're good to go.
[01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.690]  That's right.
[01:41:57.321 --> 01:42:02.164]  And we just spotlighted Facebook's admitted censorship and more for folks making jokes about it.
[01:42:02.164 --> 01:42:09.709]  The people know the truth and those making jokes have now been identified in the cockroach column versus the Ted Nugent plus column.
[01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:10.350]  I'll just say this.
[01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:14.873]  Lou Dobbs a month ago said the Democrats, the globalists are trying to break our will.
[01:42:14.873 --> 01:42:16.614]  They want to destroy Trump to break our will.
[01:42:16.614 --> 01:42:17.875]  It's not going to happen.
[01:42:17.875 --> 01:42:19.476]  They will never break our will.
[01:42:19.476 --> 01:42:25.880]  And a big part of that chain at the heart of that will is the engine that is the Motor City madman Ted Nugent.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:26.721]  Ted, you're awesome.
[01:42:26.721 --> 01:42:27.021]  Thank you.
[01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:28.501]  Thanks Alex.
[01:42:28.501 --> 01:42:29.422]  God bless America.
[01:42:29.422 --> 01:42:30.282]  God bless the U.S.
[01:42:30.282 --> 01:42:30.822]  Marine Corps.
[01:42:30.822 --> 01:42:33.323]  We're rocking them in Okinawa next week.
[01:42:33.323 --> 01:42:33.623]  All right.
[01:42:33.623 --> 01:42:35.304]  You'll be right there.
[01:42:35.304 --> 01:42:36.224]  Close to Kim Jong-un.
[01:42:36.224 --> 01:42:37.925]  Thank you.
[01:42:37.925 --> 01:42:38.825]  There goes Ted Nugent.
[01:42:38.825 --> 01:42:40.626]  Always great.
[01:42:40.626 --> 01:42:42.607]  Always great to have him with us.
[01:42:42.607 --> 01:42:48.049]  Now Joy Vila is joining us along with Kaia Jones.
[01:42:48.049 --> 01:42:48.849]  I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:42:48.849 --> 01:42:49.589]  I love her music.
[01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:50.610]  I've watched her for a long time.
[01:42:53.061 --> 01:42:58.505]  About how they got censored on YouTube two weeks ago, and blocked, and their monetization killed.
[01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:01.387]  Same thing happened with the next guest coming on, and they can overlap with hers.
[01:43:01.387 --> 01:43:02.288]  I got them on late.
[01:43:02.288 --> 01:43:03.629]  Candace Owens.
[01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:05.250]  She was on last week.
[01:43:05.250 --> 01:43:08.473]  She has the red pill black.
[01:43:08.473 --> 01:43:13.216]  She got demonetized, and some of her videos were removed after she came on the show.
[01:43:13.216 --> 01:43:17.500]  This is going on, but they all made a big deal about it.
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:17.740]  Ms.
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.801]  Jones, Ms.
[01:43:18.801 --> 01:43:19.861]  Villa, Ms.
[01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:20.142]  Owens.
[01:43:21.181 --> 01:43:23.408]  And it blew up in their face.
[01:43:23.408 --> 01:43:27.321]  KayaJones.com, JoyVilla.com, you can follow them on Twitter.
[01:43:29.963 --> 01:43:35.767]  This is a big deal because these ladies are not saying anything that I would even call controversial.
[01:43:35.767 --> 01:43:41.971]  I mean, they're just well-spoken, they're pretty, they have nice music, they've had songs that are in the top of the charts.
[01:43:41.971 --> 01:43:48.716]  That's why they're being censored, that's why they're being attacked, is because they're effective and they're successful.
[01:43:48.716 --> 01:43:54.439]  And so, this is why you hear about conservatives having to have secret societies in LA.
[01:43:54.439 --> 01:43:56.421]  I know some of the top directors, top producers.
[01:44:00.436 --> 01:44:04.098]  Literally have to meet in secret, or they'd be blocked and blackballed.
[01:44:04.098 --> 01:44:10.100]  I mean, folks that have produced films that cost $300 million, TV shows that cost $300 million, you know, top of the line.
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:14.722]  I know five or six big producers, and none of them are Republican or Democrat.
[01:44:14.722 --> 01:44:15.562]  They're just libertarian.
[01:44:15.562 --> 01:44:16.663]  They love America.
[01:44:16.663 --> 01:44:17.963]  They don't like hating America.
[01:44:17.963 --> 01:44:19.404]  They don't like trying to destroy the country.
[01:44:19.404 --> 01:44:23.986]  And they get run out of Hollywood.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:32.944]  Who's the famous director who did Conan the Barbarian and he also wrote the Dirty Harry stuff and he did Red Dawn.
[01:44:32.944 --> 01:44:35.225]  I was just reading about his story.
[01:44:35.225 --> 01:44:37.786]  Top producer, top director.
[01:44:37.786 --> 01:44:40.448]  But he loved America so they basically blackballed him.
[01:44:41.803 --> 01:44:43.543]  I'm going to leave it at that before I go any further.
[01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:48.484]  The point is, is that there's so much happening, but they didn't want to come on about that.
[01:44:48.484 --> 01:44:52.025]  They wanted to come on about it before, but now YouTube left them alone.
[01:44:52.025 --> 01:44:58.546]  So I understand they don't want to sit there and bitch about YouTube because now YouTube backed off, but it's only because they did complain.
[01:44:58.546 --> 01:45:00.307]  We have to be aware of that.
[01:45:00.307 --> 01:45:06.528]  They got saved from the wolves because everybody came to their aid, but the wolves are out there banning people, blocking people every day.
[01:45:06.528 --> 01:45:10.169]  You know, it's, it's, it's Joy Vila, uh, and it's Ms.
[01:45:10.169 --> 01:45:10.529]  Jones.
[01:45:11.289 --> 01:45:14.594]  Last week, it's the Motor City Madman this week.
[01:45:14.594 --> 01:45:17.379]  So ladies, great to have you both with us.
[01:45:17.379 --> 01:45:18.300]  Sorry to get you on late.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:20.464]  I was stuck with Uncle Ted.
[01:45:20.464 --> 01:45:21.986]  You want to start with Kaia Jones?
[01:45:21.986 --> 01:45:23.008]  You want to start with Joy?
[01:45:23.008 --> 01:45:24.891]  Who wants to go first here?
[01:45:24.891 --> 01:45:25.251]  Either way.
[01:45:26.198 --> 01:45:28.099]  Yeah, I'll go first.
[01:45:28.099 --> 01:45:30.140]  Alex, it's great to be back on your show.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.961]  You're always preaching the truth.
[01:45:31.961 --> 01:45:36.224]  You're always, you know, holding it down for the true Americans and the conservatives out there.
[01:45:36.224 --> 01:45:38.465]  We need a voice and you're our voice, so thank you, Alex.
[01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:43.448]  Well, we're in this together, and listen, I mean, it's not only do I like you and like your music and like what you say.
[01:45:43.448 --> 01:45:47.590]  If I disagreed with you, I'd be saying you shouldn't be banned or demonetized.
[01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:48.711]  This is real discrimination.
[01:45:50.546 --> 01:45:51.106]  Yeah.
[01:45:51.106 --> 01:45:53.148]  I mean, it's crazy that it happened to us.
[01:45:53.148 --> 01:45:55.569]  When it happened, we were absolutely shocked.
[01:45:55.569 --> 01:46:00.953]  And I wasn't going to go public with it, but when it happened to Kaia, I said, we have to do something about it.
[01:46:00.953 --> 01:46:10.520]  So we took to social media and only because we took to social media, did YouTube back.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.020]  Now, Ms.
[01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:12.941]  Jones, the same thing basically happened to you.
[01:46:12.941 --> 01:46:13.742]  What's your take on this?
[01:46:14.611 --> 01:46:16.652]  Yeah, mine were my views.
[01:46:16.652 --> 01:46:21.736]  My views were going from, you know, over 62,000 in a couple days.
[01:46:21.736 --> 01:46:23.917]  By the next morning, it had dropped to 53.
[01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:32.577]  So it was manipulation of actual algorithms of the, and you can't take plays away versus followers and things like that.
[01:46:32.577 --> 01:46:35.219]  So very odd, very strange.
[01:46:35.219 --> 01:46:40.404]  And so me and Joy, we took to social media and my pieces have been released and they're going back up.
[01:46:40.404 --> 01:46:44.207]  But yeah, there's, there's a lot of censorship that goes on with the web.
[01:46:44.207 --> 01:46:51.534]  We know that they're, you know, run by these big, big powers that be that have their own narrative that they want to push and control.
[01:46:52.625 --> 01:46:57.607]  Well, the good news is, you ladies both have got millions of followers and listeners.
[01:46:57.607 --> 01:47:00.448]  You've only got bigger standing in the face of censorship.
[01:47:00.448 --> 01:47:03.789]  And I know you wanted to shift gears to something really positive now.
[01:47:03.789 --> 01:47:09.150]  Boy, how they exacerbated the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia.
[01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:13.472]  But three weeks later, it blew up in their face in the tragedy Harvey.
[01:47:13.472 --> 01:47:17.313]  How that, you can just feel the energy level go from negative to positive.
[01:47:17.313 --> 01:47:19.754]  How the polls shifted in the last week.
[01:47:20.886 --> 01:47:33.993]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, and they tried their hardest to say that America's racist and, you know, there's white supremacy everywhere, and then you see these so-called white supremacists helping each other with the Hurricane Harvey relief.
[01:47:33.993 --> 01:47:35.633]  And that's what we saw when we were in Texas.
[01:47:35.633 --> 01:47:48.760]  We saw all different colors helping each other, joining together, and we're happy to announce we, with our social media campaign and being there, we've raised two million dollars with MercuryOne.org.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.922]  Wow, I should have come out minute one.
[01:47:51.922 --> 01:47:56.065]  Because you started with that NFL player raising a few million, then he raised like forty-something million.
[01:47:56.065 --> 01:47:57.647]  You have raised two million dollars.
[01:47:57.647 --> 01:48:08.736]  Tell folks, we should have started this out, that you know, censored YouTubers, censored Patriot, not even conservative, just censored Patriot YouTubers raised two million for hurricane victims.
[01:48:08.736 --> 01:48:11.618]  That's right.
[01:48:11.618 --> 01:48:12.358]  Yeah.
[01:48:12.358 --> 01:48:13.820]  And we use our platform.
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:16.402]  You know, Kai and I said, listen, this is important to us.
[01:48:16.402 --> 01:48:17.863]  Not a lot of celebrities are coming out.
[01:48:17.863 --> 01:48:19.004]  When we came out, it was
[01:48:21.171 --> 01:48:25.374]  A week ago when it started and nobody else was coming out at the time.
[01:48:25.374 --> 01:48:27.176]  And so we thought this is important.
[01:48:27.176 --> 01:48:30.018]  And so the first 24 hours we actually raised $200,000.
[01:48:30.018 --> 01:48:32.680]  And then it just started snowballing from there.
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:35.702]  So we just ask everyone if they can give to mercuryone.org.
[01:48:35.702 --> 01:48:36.843]  It's a great organization.
[01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:43.348]  100% of the proceeds actually go to helping the hurricane victims, unlike Red Cross, which donates 10%.
[01:48:43.348 --> 01:48:47.771]  And we were actually there on the ground in Houston and they're authentic.
[01:48:47.771 --> 01:48:49.273]  This is the real deal.
[01:48:49.793 --> 01:48:50.133]  That's right.
[01:48:50.133 --> 01:48:53.115]  Talk about how bad it is, because this disaster is ongoing.
[01:48:53.115 --> 01:48:53.275]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:53.275 --> 01:48:55.016]  Yeah, Kaya was there an extra day.
[01:49:17.325 --> 01:49:20.550]  Well, that's the thing, that if we weren't censored and it was actual...
[01:49:21.374 --> 01:49:29.956]  Proper analytics on what, you know, are allowing independent artists to have their traction and conservative independent artists.
[01:49:29.956 --> 01:49:32.077]  How much more money could we have raised?
[01:49:32.077 --> 01:49:35.038]  Because, I mean, we did this while censorship was going on.
[01:49:35.038 --> 01:49:39.999]  So, I mean, it was beautiful and we were able to physically help.
[01:49:39.999 --> 01:49:46.321]  We did a lot of periscopes when we were down there, but we were able to hand out, you know, gift cards, money.
[01:49:46.321 --> 01:49:46.981]  We cooked.
[01:49:46.981 --> 01:49:50.022]  We, you know, with all the different sets that
[01:49:50.723 --> 01:49:51.224]  Yeah.
[01:49:51.224 --> 01:49:51.604]  Oh yeah.
[01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:01.731]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:50:01.731 --> 01:50:04.052]  And that's Rubicon right there, the video showing.
[01:50:04.052 --> 01:50:06.934]  Team Rubicon, that's actually the mucking out.
[01:50:06.934 --> 01:50:12.358]  That's when we went out and helped these guys actually get all the stuff out of people's homes.
[01:50:12.358 --> 01:50:13.939]  Now, how bad is it?
[01:50:13.939 --> 01:50:15.640]  It smells like death out there.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:17.081]  There is sewage in the water.
[01:50:17.081 --> 01:50:18.582]  There's bodies in the water.
[01:50:18.582 --> 01:50:20.083]  The death toll's going up.
[01:50:20.083 --> 01:50:24.566]  The smell, the suffocation, now there's mold is coming out of the walls.
[01:50:24.566 --> 01:50:30.930]  So we had to get everything out of those homes because the mold is getting so bad that it can actually kill the people that are around.
[01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:36.456]  Oh, believe me, I'm super sick, and most of my family is, and we're hundreds of miles away.
[01:50:36.456 --> 01:50:39.759]  Reportedly, there are mold levels never before recorded in Houston.
[01:50:39.759 --> 01:50:42.923]  The highest levels ever recorded, ABC News is reporting.
[01:50:45.450 --> 01:50:46.150]  Stay there, ladies.
[01:50:46.150 --> 01:50:47.791]  Please go on the next hour with us.
[01:50:47.791 --> 01:50:55.155]  We have Candace Owens also censored coming up for her political speech because the left wants to say all women support world government.

[01:54:31.434 --> 01:54:34.197]  Kaya Jones is our guest along with Joy Vila.
[01:54:34.197 --> 01:54:36.779]  They're both big music stars.
[01:54:36.779 --> 01:54:38.200]  Millions and millions of people follow them.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.142]  Millions of song downloads.
[01:54:40.142 --> 01:54:47.168]  And they've got the courage to be supporting Trump in the face of the massive bullying.
[01:54:47.168 --> 01:54:55.476]  And most men I know, even if they like the stock market being up and jobs coming back in and America actually running our own affairs, they're scared.
[01:54:57.148 --> 01:55:00.490]  They want to play both sides and basically be lukewarm.
[01:55:00.490 --> 01:55:02.531]  That's what's gotten us to this point.
[01:55:02.531 --> 01:55:04.332]  The left is bullying everybody.
[01:55:04.332 --> 01:55:05.852]  They're not the left.
[01:55:05.852 --> 01:55:07.993]  They're trying to create a cult here.
[01:55:07.993 --> 01:55:10.134]  I used to go after Bush.
[01:55:10.134 --> 01:55:11.515]  I used to be a complete independent.
[01:55:11.515 --> 01:55:12.035]  I still am.
[01:55:12.035 --> 01:55:15.317]  I hate the Republican leadership.
[01:55:15.317 --> 01:55:16.978]  The rhinos that are trying to block Trump.
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:28.475]  But when you see somebody under such attack like Trump, how do you not get behind him when he's willing to sit there and weather this attack?
[01:55:28.475 --> 01:55:30.058]  You guys want to make comments to that, Ms.
[01:55:30.058 --> 01:55:30.879]  Jones or Ms.
[01:55:30.879 --> 01:55:31.100]  Fila?
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:33.321]  Yeah, it's so true.
[01:55:33.321 --> 01:55:33.941]  No, go ahead.
[01:55:33.941 --> 01:55:35.361]  You want to go ahead, Joy?
[01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:44.085]  Sure, Kaya, because I know we both know the same thing, is no other president in history has gotten so much hate, but has done so much good, like Donald Trump.
[01:55:44.085 --> 01:55:47.686]  And all he simply does is wants to make America great again.
[01:55:47.686 --> 01:55:53.849]  And, you know, we see so much backlash from people who just don't understand that American values need to be preserved.
[01:55:53.849 --> 01:55:56.190]  Conservative values need to be preserved.
[01:55:56.190 --> 01:55:58.551]  We need to have family first, America first.
[01:55:58.551 --> 01:56:01.492]  We need to make sure we are one nation under God.
[01:56:01.952 --> 01:56:02.573]  Unification.
[01:56:02.573 --> 01:56:04.335]  And we're tolerant of everybody else.
[01:56:04.335 --> 01:56:07.700]  They're telling us we can't be traditionalists if we want to.
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:09.402]  And I want to expand on that.
[01:56:09.402 --> 01:56:10.564]  You talk about delivering.
[01:56:10.564 --> 01:56:13.968]  Even his enemies go, well he really does say what he means.
[01:56:13.968 --> 01:56:16.412]  And he really is delivering on a lot of his promises.
[01:56:16.412 --> 01:56:17.874]  And they're so upset about that.
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:22.803]  Because they can't deny it when they see the stock market is up, jobs are in.
[01:56:22.803 --> 01:56:32.550]  You know, I mean, talking to those Hurricane Harvey victims, I wore my Make America Great Again hat and people walked up to me and talked to me and said, thank you for wearing that hat.
[01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:33.611]  We love our president.
[01:56:33.611 --> 01:56:36.133]  We're so glad he visited us twice.
[01:56:36.133 --> 01:56:40.936]  They love their president down there and they're in the middle of trying to save their own lives.
[01:56:40.936 --> 01:56:42.277]  And yet they still love their president.
[01:56:42.277 --> 01:56:43.398]  They have hope for America.
[01:56:43.398 --> 01:56:47.661]  They have people in America who have everything handed to them on a platter and they are complaining.
[01:56:47.921 --> 01:56:50.027]  Kyle, where are we right now in America?
[01:56:50.027 --> 01:56:52.394]  I mean, this epic battle going on.
[01:56:52.394 --> 01:56:55.803]  Would you say the forces of liberty are winning, or at a stalemate, or losing?
[01:56:56.474 --> 01:56:59.096]  No, we're in a scary time in America.
[01:56:59.096 --> 01:57:12.247]  I think it's imperative that everyone starts speaking out and being proud of what their narrative is, especially if they support the president, and they support our military, and they support our police, and they support our flag, and they support our national anthem.
[01:57:12.247 --> 01:57:16.511]  We need to swing the pendulum.
[01:57:16.511 --> 01:57:23.617]  The problem is that there's such a negative every day, that even just energetically, you are putting out so much negative
[01:57:24.235 --> 01:57:35.822]  The weather's been nuts, everything's just so intense, and it's all, you know, just constant, yeah, yeah, yeah, constant nagging and complaining and everything's, you know, scotches falling.
[01:57:35.822 --> 01:57:43.607]  Instead of looking at it like, you know what, you had your time, eight years, he did absolutely nothing for this country but deplete it.
[01:57:43.607 --> 01:57:46.689]  I'm sorry, but... That's right, that's right.
[01:57:46.689 --> 01:57:49.510]  And make race relations worse.
[01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:50.451]  You know, the narrative for
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:52.982]  You know, Obama was the same.
[01:57:52.982 --> 01:57:55.685]  You're the same skin as me makes you kin to me.
[01:57:55.685 --> 01:57:57.928]  So they look at Joy, who's biracial.
[01:57:57.928 --> 01:58:00.030]  I am biracial as well.
[01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:02.954]  And they don't really get that it has nothing to do with that.
[01:58:02.954 --> 01:58:04.516]  It has to do with the soul.
[01:58:04.516 --> 01:58:06.137]  Who are you really walking with?
[01:58:06.137 --> 01:58:08.741]  And I'm sorry, but I have the utmost
[01:58:09.521 --> 01:58:16.928]  Um, you know, thoughts on the ability for Trump to do everything that he said he was going to do, including build, building that wall.
[01:58:16.928 --> 01:58:19.271]  Oh, they're scared because they know he has the ability.
[01:58:19.271 --> 01:58:20.291]  Ladies, please stay there.
[01:58:20.291 --> 01:58:25.757]  JoyVilla.com, KayaJones.com, K-A-Y-A-Jones.com.

[01:58:34.927 --> 01:58:39.552]  The tip of the spear against the bullies, against the censorship, against the mind control.
[01:58:39.552 --> 01:58:41.234]  Say whatever you want about them.
[01:58:41.234 --> 01:58:42.456]  They got courage.
[01:58:42.456 --> 01:58:43.758]  They're not under the mind control.

[02:00:18.955 --> 02:00:20.977]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[02:00:20.977 --> 02:00:22.418]  And it's beautiful.
[02:00:22.418 --> 02:00:26.561]  And we need to focus on the real truth and not focus on the fake news.
[02:00:26.561 --> 02:00:29.984]  The girl who wore a Make America Great Again dress at the Grammys, that's me.
[02:00:31.762 --> 02:00:32.342]  Yes!
[02:00:32.342 --> 02:00:37.806]  We were watching you on Alex and everything.
[02:00:37.806 --> 02:00:38.926]  Oh yeah, Alex Jones!

[02:00:40.447 --> 02:00:40.908]  Count us!
[02:00:40.908 --> 02:00:43.389]  Save me from depression.
[02:00:43.389 --> 02:00:44.150]  Oh my gosh.
[02:00:44.150 --> 02:00:47.312]  I was always knowing everything was wrong for years.
[02:00:47.312 --> 02:00:47.832]  Yeah.
[02:00:47.832 --> 02:00:51.295]  Until these guys live in San Antonio.
[02:00:51.295 --> 02:00:52.015]  They picked it up.
[02:00:52.015 --> 02:00:54.677]  Down here, they would run it on Channel 8.
[02:00:54.677 --> 02:00:55.057]  Wow.
[02:00:55.057 --> 02:00:55.557]  PBS.
[02:00:55.557 --> 02:00:57.779]  Every once in a great while, people would catch it.
[02:00:57.779 --> 02:00:59.580]  And I'm like, oh my god, oh my god.
[02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:00.721]  I'm not the only one!
[02:01:01.581 --> 02:01:04.482]  There's other people and it made me feel so much better.
[02:01:04.482 --> 02:01:05.682]  Incredible.
[02:01:05.682 --> 02:01:09.483]  It's cured her depression because the truth heals.
[02:01:09.483 --> 02:01:11.104]  The truth does heal.
[02:01:11.104 --> 02:01:12.264]  This is the truth.
[02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:14.584]  People together who are working in unifying.
[02:01:14.584 --> 02:01:15.405]  Yes, yes.
[02:01:15.405 --> 02:01:16.465]  And what's your name?
[02:01:16.465 --> 02:01:17.065]  Beverly Hart.
[02:01:17.065 --> 02:01:18.545]  Beverly, thank you for that hug.
[02:01:18.545 --> 02:01:20.766]  Beverly's an Alex Jones fan.
[02:01:20.766 --> 02:01:21.546]  Major, major.
[02:01:21.546 --> 02:01:22.806]  We buy products.
[02:01:22.806 --> 02:01:23.807]  We got it all.
[02:01:23.807 --> 02:01:25.707]  I got Rainforce with me right now.
[02:01:25.707 --> 02:01:27.388]  I got Rainforce with me right now.
[02:01:27.388 --> 02:01:28.488]  You guys are too nice.
[02:01:29.468 --> 02:01:33.151]  That's Joy Vila and Kaia Jones is with us as well.
[02:01:33.151 --> 02:01:40.616]  You know, from 99% of people with rebel flags, which is just a battle flag, it is a thing we got our ass kicked and all this happened.
[02:01:40.616 --> 02:01:46.820]  A great great granddaddy was in it and it was all about a war about resources and we just have it because we're being rebellious.
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.061]  It is a very small minority.
[02:01:48.061 --> 02:01:53.985]  It's about racism and you can take any symbol and claim it's connected to racism, but in my experience and seeing all the footage of folks,
[02:01:54.545 --> 02:01:58.390]  With their rebel flags out, saving black people, white people, you name it.
[02:01:58.390 --> 02:02:03.777]  If they were racist before, which I don't think most of them are, coming together like this just neutralizes it, Joy.
[02:02:03.777 --> 02:02:05.519]  This is beautiful what we saw.
[02:02:05.519 --> 02:02:06.320]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.361]  Isn't that beautiful?
[02:02:07.361 --> 02:02:08.983]  And that's why I wanted to put that out.
[02:02:08.983 --> 02:02:11.266]  I've got tons of footage of unity.
[02:02:11.266 --> 02:02:12.368]  Kaya and I, we did
[02:02:12.728 --> 02:02:15.911]  We did video, we did Facebook, and this is why we went out there.
[02:02:15.911 --> 02:02:23.897]  Not only to raise money for hurricane victims, but also to show that they are struggling out there, and yet they are unified.
[02:02:23.897 --> 02:02:26.780]  More than Americans who are, they have everything.
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:29.442]  Some of these people, and they're complaining about what they have.
[02:02:29.442 --> 02:02:31.223]  And those guys, they're pro-America.
[02:02:31.223 --> 02:02:32.284]  They love you, Alex.
[02:02:32.284 --> 02:02:33.725]  They love our president.
[02:02:33.725 --> 02:02:35.427]  They were so happy to see us, you know.
[02:02:35.427 --> 02:02:40.351]  We were able to gift that family $1,000 worth of gift cards, give them food, give them clothing.
[02:02:41.211 --> 02:02:42.652]  And help a lot more families like that.
[02:02:42.652 --> 02:02:44.092]  And I just gotta say a shout-out.
[02:02:44.092 --> 02:02:46.974]  I'm not paid to do this, but I do have brain force with me.
[02:02:46.974 --> 02:02:50.975]  And this got me through the stress, because there was a lot of pain and suffering seeing that out there.
[02:02:50.975 --> 02:02:52.236]  And you just want to do so much more.
[02:02:52.236 --> 02:02:57.378]  I was gonna say, you guys still look great out there in the middle of that stinkin' swamp.
[02:02:57.378 --> 02:02:58.198]  God is good!
[02:02:58.198 --> 02:03:01.820]  Yeah, it was incredible.
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:04.281]  There was so much unity out there.
[02:03:04.281 --> 02:03:07.142]  Didn't you just see so many people coming together, Kaya?
[02:03:07.142 --> 02:03:08.262]  Oh no, it was incredible.
[02:03:08.262 --> 02:03:09.683]  I mean, it was non-stop.
[02:03:10.467 --> 02:03:14.671]  Like they were victors, even though they are victims of this disaster.
[02:03:14.671 --> 02:03:15.111]  Yeah.
[02:03:15.111 --> 02:03:16.513]  And that's another point.
[02:03:16.513 --> 02:03:24.520]  Why would YouTube, I know they're not censoring you now, so you don't want to rub it in, but why would they censor these loving unification videos?
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.863]  Because they know that's the power.
[02:03:26.863 --> 02:03:31.367]  Every time I put out the nicest unity video that goes viral, that's what they ban.
[02:03:32.479 --> 02:03:54.550]  Well, they're not going to ban that video because they backed down and we made sure they backed down and we're grateful that they did because we use YouTube, you know, and that's the thing is if you're an independent artist and you're getting suppressed by certain companies like Facebook or Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, you know, you want to make sure that you fight it, but also you realize you need this to be able to get the word out.
[02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:54.990]  No, I agree.
[02:03:54.990 --> 02:03:58.351]  And we kind of jump between the platforms as they censor.
[02:03:58.351 --> 02:03:58.912]  No, exactly.
[02:03:58.912 --> 02:04:00.532]  We don't want to make them enemies.
[02:04:00.532 --> 02:04:01.313]  We just want them to stop.
[02:04:01.773 --> 02:04:02.293]  No.
[02:04:02.293 --> 02:04:04.334]  We just want to say, listen, stop bullying us.
[02:04:04.334 --> 02:04:05.155]  Back off.
[02:04:05.155 --> 02:04:06.175]  And now we're good.
[02:04:06.175 --> 02:04:07.215]  We're friends again.
[02:04:07.215 --> 02:04:09.156]  You know, YouTube's been good to me now.
[02:04:09.156 --> 02:04:10.457]  So they're going to stay in their corner.
[02:04:10.457 --> 02:04:11.357]  I'll stay in mine.
[02:04:11.357 --> 02:04:14.318]  And keep creating content, because they can't stop that.
[02:04:14.318 --> 02:04:15.319]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:04:15.319 --> 02:04:17.320]  I'm going to tell you something.
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:18.860]  I want to create a radio show.
[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:19.821]  And we've had the affiliates.
[02:04:20.481 --> 02:04:24.383]  That is roundtable hosted by ladies like yourselves.
[02:04:24.383 --> 02:04:25.823]  And I've been privately thinking about it.
[02:04:25.823 --> 02:04:26.784]  I know you guys are busy.
[02:04:26.784 --> 02:04:28.824]  That's why I want it to be like five or six hosts.
[02:04:28.824 --> 02:04:31.305]  That way people don't have to work five days a week with all the other jobs you have.
[02:04:31.305 --> 02:04:37.828]  But I would like to, I mean, I'd like to send you guys the equipment and set it up so that you guys can be contributors for InfoWars.
[02:04:37.828 --> 02:04:41.169]  Oh, we would love to, Alex!
[02:04:41.169 --> 02:04:42.070]  You bet, absolutely.
[02:04:42.070 --> 02:04:50.073]  Well, come back if you can, because I want to come back and play some of these clips and get to our next guest, who's also fighting the system.
[02:04:52.421 --> 02:05:03.488]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[02:05:03.488 --> 02:05:06.470]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:15.056]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[02:05:15.056 --> 02:05:17.698]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[02:05:17.938 --> 02:05:26.080]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:30.422]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[02:05:30.422 --> 02:05:35.343]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[02:05:35.343 --> 02:05:41.325]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[02:05:41.565 --> 02:05:43.746]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[02:05:43.746 --> 02:05:49.607]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[02:05:49.607 --> 02:05:52.307]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:05:52.307 --> 02:05:57.769]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:57.769 --> 02:05:59.869]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:05:59.869 --> 02:06:05.150]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:05.150 --> 02:06:08.871]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[02:06:09.011 --> 02:06:12.454]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:12.454 --> 02:06:15.637]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:15.637 --> 02:06:19.521]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:19.521 --> 02:06:26.688]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:26.688 --> 02:06:32.073]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[02:06:32.333 --> 02:06:34.394]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[02:06:34.394 --> 02:06:42.680]  Due to a request from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:50.985]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:06:52.563 --> 02:07:00.847]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[02:07:00.847 --> 02:07:02.067]  A 360 win.
[02:07:02.067 --> 02:07:08.610]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[02:07:08.610 --> 02:07:16.134]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:07:16.554 --> 02:07:21.618]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:07:21.618 --> 02:07:27.744]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:07:27.744 --> 02:07:35.530]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:07:35.530 --> 02:07:42.736]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:07:42.736 --> 02:07:43.537]  10% off on AutoShip.
[02:07:43.677 --> 02:07:46.118]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:46.118 --> 02:07:48.079]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:07:48.079 --> 02:07:53.242]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:07:53.242 --> 02:08:01.466]  You want answers?
[02:08:01.466 --> 02:08:03.307]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:03.307 --> 02:08:08.050]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:13.613 --> 02:08:15.053]  Kaya Jones joins us.
[02:08:15.053 --> 02:08:25.856]  Joy Vila has had her song, Make America Great Again, in the top ten charts since Trump got elected, or right before.
[02:08:25.856 --> 02:08:27.257]  She's been a guest many times.
[02:08:27.257 --> 02:08:31.998]  She got censored wearing that dynamite dress there in Hollywood.
[02:08:33.018 --> 02:08:44.731]  Well, she already had some hits along with Kaia Jones, but she's gone to number one now after her YouTube channel was censored and blocked and demonetized two weeks ago.
[02:08:44.731 --> 02:08:48.235]  Make America Great Again is now number one!
[02:08:49.326 --> 02:08:54.007]  On Amazon.com, that's above all the other top groups.
[02:08:54.007 --> 02:08:56.407]  That is an unprecedented victory.
[02:08:56.407 --> 02:09:00.928]  Number one, 99 cents, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:00.928 --> 02:09:02.928]  And I have no connection to it monetarily.
[02:09:02.928 --> 02:09:05.689]  It just excites me to see that at number one.
[02:09:05.689 --> 02:09:16.311]  And again, we were talking about the Streisand effect, how what we're pushing culturally, coming together, not being racist, judging folks by the content of what they do, not what color they are.
[02:09:17.133 --> 02:09:18.493]  I go to a restaurant because the food's good.
[02:09:18.493 --> 02:09:21.454]  I don't care if they're Asian, black, white, mixed, Hispanic.
[02:09:21.454 --> 02:09:28.496]  I go listen to music on the radio or in concert because I like the music.
[02:09:28.496 --> 02:09:32.677]  I'm a married man, but I look at the lady because she's beautiful wearing that dress because she is.
[02:09:32.677 --> 02:09:33.577]  That's God's creation.
[02:09:33.577 --> 02:09:38.098]  It doesn't matter to me what color her hair is or what color her eyes are.
[02:09:38.098 --> 02:09:41.939]  That's what this comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is that we are coming out of the hate.
[02:09:41.939 --> 02:09:43.840]  We see them manipulating us.
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.080]  We understand what's happening.
[02:09:46.462 --> 02:09:59.310]  I want to talk about that, bring in our next guest to co-host with us, and then I also want to get into Trump handing out food, working so hard with Melania, trying to heal these fishers, being loving, and the media
[02:10:00.566 --> 02:10:01.947]  Making jokes about it.
[02:10:01.947 --> 02:10:06.028]  So right now, before we talk about the Streisand effect, let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:10:06.028 --> 02:10:13.150]  This is what Trump actually did versus we have the Morning Joe making fun of him.
[02:10:13.150 --> 02:10:17.452]  Morning Joe hoots with laughter watching Trump load a truck.
[02:10:17.452 --> 02:10:18.632]  Well, why weren't you down there?
[02:10:18.632 --> 02:10:19.052]  Here it is.
[02:10:19.052 --> 02:10:21.973]  Hey, can you handle this?
[02:10:21.973 --> 02:10:24.854]  It's a lot of... Have a good time.
[02:10:24.854 --> 02:10:25.455]  Thank you, man.
[02:10:25.455 --> 02:10:25.595]  Yeah.
[02:10:29.815 --> 02:10:29.995]  Thanks.
[02:10:29.995 --> 02:10:30.495]  Thank you, man.
[02:10:30.495 --> 02:10:32.537]  I'll put this back here for you.
[02:10:32.537 --> 02:10:33.037]  All right.
[02:10:33.037 --> 02:10:33.437]  Okay?
[02:10:33.437 --> 02:10:34.038]  You got it.
[02:10:34.038 --> 02:10:34.678]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:34.678 --> 02:10:36.339]  One more.
[02:10:36.339 --> 02:10:39.441]  Loading it up, huh?
[02:10:39.441 --> 02:10:40.582]  And one more.
[02:10:40.582 --> 02:10:44.204]  Good job.
[02:10:44.204 --> 02:10:46.525]  Here you go.
[02:10:46.525 --> 02:10:49.907]  Just go ahead.
[02:10:49.907 --> 02:10:51.128]  Put that there.
[02:10:51.128 --> 02:10:52.029]  You got it?
[02:10:52.029 --> 02:10:56.832]  Okay, fellas.
[02:11:03.693 --> 02:11:05.494]  Now that's what Trump actually did.
[02:11:05.494 --> 02:11:07.856]  Let's play the morning Joe.
[02:11:07.856 --> 02:11:17.881]  Because understand, just the president going and handing out food, and going down there twice, and going and shaking everybody's hands and hugging folks, raises their spirits.
[02:11:17.881 --> 02:11:21.723]  It's not something the globalist Obama or even Bush did.
[02:11:21.723 --> 02:11:24.285]  And it gets everybody else to give money.
[02:11:24.285 --> 02:11:26.266]  In Houston, Metro's 10 million people.
[02:11:26.983 --> 02:11:27.463]  And it's bad.
[02:11:27.463 --> 02:11:28.925]  There's dead bodies, sewage everywhere.
[02:11:28.925 --> 02:11:30.126]  They're in crisis.
[02:11:30.126 --> 02:11:32.167]  And they need continued support.
[02:11:32.167 --> 02:11:37.451]  So Trump's keeping them in the news, getting billions of dollars donated.
[02:11:37.451 --> 02:11:40.014]  He himself gave a million, and they made fun of it.
[02:11:40.014 --> 02:11:41.775]  Hey, Scarborough, how about you give something?
[02:11:41.775 --> 02:11:45.878]  At least Leonardo DiCaprio gave a million.
[02:11:45.878 --> 02:11:47.900]  I mean, how dare you sit there and run your mouth?
[02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:52.444]  So here's Joe Scarborough making a big joke out of all this.
[02:11:52.444 --> 02:11:53.344]  You talk about sick.
[02:11:53.344 --> 02:11:53.685]  Here it is.
[02:11:56.337 --> 02:12:00.239]  The hands are too big.
[02:12:00.239 --> 02:12:02.060]  Yeah, for like a nine-year-old.
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:07.323]  But anyway, Willie, you see the president's getting involved in relief efforts.
[02:12:07.323 --> 02:12:08.083]  It's heartening to me.
[02:12:08.083 --> 02:12:10.224]  And you can tell that he's done this.
[02:12:10.224 --> 02:12:12.105]  I don't know if he did it with AmeriCares.
[02:12:12.105 --> 02:12:13.846]  I don't know if he's a Red Cross guy.
[02:12:13.846 --> 02:12:15.147]  But here he is helping out.
[02:12:15.147 --> 02:12:17.007]  That's great.
[02:12:17.007 --> 02:12:18.228]  And then do we have the picture?
[02:12:18.228 --> 02:12:19.529]  That's all you got?
[02:12:19.529 --> 02:12:20.709]  You don't have the one of him?
[02:12:20.709 --> 02:12:22.650]  What about the family when they came down?
[02:12:22.650 --> 02:12:25.612]  You don't have where- The guys- Jared.
[02:12:26.232 --> 02:12:33.774]  Willie, so let's explain that he didn't get the one where the first thing he did, he actually put in the cab.
[02:12:33.774 --> 02:12:38.395]  Well, that was obviously a photo op for the president, who did a nice job going down there twice.
[02:12:38.395 --> 02:12:40.095]  Let's give him credit for going down there.
[02:12:40.095 --> 02:12:41.916]  He was humanizing it.
[02:12:41.916 --> 02:12:43.136]  I think we have the video somewhere.
[02:12:43.136 --> 02:12:46.117]  Put the bucket in the back of a pickup, Mr. President.
[02:12:46.117 --> 02:12:46.857]  Put this in the pickup.
[02:12:49.311 --> 02:12:50.072]  Leave them on screen.
[02:12:50.072 --> 02:12:52.754]  You want to know the enemy of humanity, the elitist scum
[02:13:11.946 --> 02:13:21.954]  Treating you like you're an idiot, acting like we're in junior high, and Trump's not the cool kid, and they're all the cool kids at the cool table, making fun of the nerd kids at their nerd table.
[02:13:21.954 --> 02:13:25.396]  I mean, this is everything I hated in high school.
[02:13:25.396 --> 02:13:27.798]  Everything I hated in junior high.
[02:13:27.798 --> 02:13:29.360]  These are the people's asses I kicked.
[02:13:30.106 --> 02:13:32.047]  They were beating up little nerds and stuff.
[02:13:32.047 --> 02:13:35.507]  These people are so sick.
[02:13:35.507 --> 02:13:36.848]  And it goes on and on.
[02:13:36.848 --> 02:13:38.148]  Making fun of Trump.
[02:13:38.148 --> 02:13:38.708]  Walks up.
[02:13:38.708 --> 02:13:39.749]  The guy puts his hands out.
[02:13:39.749 --> 02:13:40.869]  He's humanizing him.
[02:13:40.869 --> 02:13:41.529]  Hands him the food.
[02:13:41.529 --> 02:13:43.750]  Oh, how dare you put it in the front of the truck?
[02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:45.450]  How does Trump know it's raining outside?
[02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:46.610]  Oh, you should have put it in the back.
[02:13:46.610 --> 02:13:47.631]  Oh, you're an idiot.
[02:13:47.631 --> 02:13:48.891]  You're the man in the arena.
[02:13:49.653 --> 02:13:51.814]  Pull up Teddy Roosevelt's Man in the Arena, please.
[02:13:51.814 --> 02:13:53.314]  You're the man in the arena.
[02:13:53.314 --> 02:13:54.555]  He's actually out there doing something.
[02:13:54.555 --> 02:14:08.799]  You're sitting there in New York at NBC with the daughter of one of the biggest mass murderers in world history, Brzezinski, who bragged that he backed the Khmer Rouge murdering millions, all the other crap he did.
[02:14:08.799 --> 02:14:13.661]  You sit up there with the dead intern in your office and all the rest of the crud you're engaged in.
[02:14:15.233 --> 02:14:22.119]  And then you sit there and act like Trump's bad when he genuinely cares and is down there for real, and he was during the campaign.
[02:14:22.119 --> 02:14:25.383]  Hillary wouldn't even show up in the hurricanes!
[02:14:25.383 --> 02:14:37.234]  She was too busy getting money from rich donors, too busy stealing Haitian relief money to go to Haiti when we had our airplanes down there exposing the UN sex crimes that Hillary and her staff were caught running!
[02:14:39.195 --> 02:14:42.877]  And so the media then turns it all into Pizzagate diversions.
[02:14:42.877 --> 02:14:51.500]  The Man in the Arena, excerpt from a speech, Citizenship and the Republic, delivered at the Sarborne in Paris, France, the 23rd of April, 1910.
[02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:54.522]  It is not the critic who counts.
[02:14:55.422 --> 02:15:01.027]  Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done better.
[02:15:01.027 --> 02:15:15.599]  Credit belongs to the man in the arena, who's actually in the arena, whose face is marred by the dust, the sweat, the blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming.
[02:15:15.879 --> 02:15:40.120]  But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls
[02:15:41.118 --> 02:15:43.841]  You know, neither victory nor defeat.
[02:15:43.841 --> 02:15:47.525]  Now let's go to women who know real victory, real action.
[02:15:47.525 --> 02:15:50.328]  They raised two plus million dollars last week.
[02:15:50.328 --> 02:15:55.474]  They have absolutely gone in there, covered what's happening, brought hope to people.
[02:15:55.474 --> 02:15:57.416]  Kaia Jones and Joy Vila.
[02:15:57.416 --> 02:16:01.341]  And then we're bringing in, as well with us, Candace Owens.
[02:16:01.761 --> 02:16:16.120]  Who has videos on average 300, 400, 500,000 views, some with millions, just roars on to the scene, got targeted in a race war false flag by the Democrats, by the deep state, in a shut-up where they run most of these racist bots everywhere.
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:17.442]  She caught them red-handed.
[02:16:17.442 --> 02:16:18.803]  So it's blown up in her face.
[02:16:19.304 --> 02:16:22.827]  Blown up in their face and then success is blown up in her face.
[02:16:22.827 --> 02:16:28.811]  So then they tried to censor her the day after she's on with me and Paul Watson, but then she spoke out.
[02:16:28.811 --> 02:16:30.572]  So then that blew up in their face.
[02:16:30.572 --> 02:16:33.374]  So this is an amazing time to be alive.
[02:16:33.374 --> 02:16:34.054]  Before we go.
[02:16:34.975 --> 02:16:35.615]  We're good to go.
[02:16:56.261 --> 02:16:58.143]  Eye of the Tiger comes to mind.
[02:16:58.143 --> 02:17:01.925]  What is it like to see them making fun of the man in the arena?
[02:17:01.925 --> 02:17:07.169]  To see Joe Scarborough and all those other hosts just absolutely are an embarrassment to humanity.
[02:17:08.032 --> 02:17:13.254]  You know, I look at Mika's face, and like you said, this is everything you hated about high school, right?
[02:17:13.254 --> 02:17:14.214]  The popular kids.
[02:17:14.214 --> 02:17:18.136]  Well, what happened to those popular kids after everybody graduated?
[02:17:18.136 --> 02:17:22.777]  They became the drunks, the losers, the deadbeats.
[02:17:22.777 --> 02:17:29.660]  And it's the nerds and the ones everyone ignored who rose to the top, because they're smarter and better than everyone else.
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:31.000]  And look at her face.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.821]  She's so disgusted, but that's all she has.
[02:17:33.821 --> 02:17:35.502]  She has one face, disgust.
[02:17:35.902 --> 02:17:37.223]  She can't think for herself.
[02:17:37.223 --> 02:17:38.464]  She's listening to what Joe says.
[02:17:38.464 --> 02:17:39.785]  He can't think for himself.
[02:17:39.785 --> 02:17:43.949]  They're both just a putrid bowl of regurgitating the same story.
[02:17:43.949 --> 02:17:51.975]  And the fact that they're politicizing this drama to make it their own drama and taking away from what the President is doing to save the lives of those people.
[02:17:51.975 --> 02:17:54.197]  We looked in the faces of those people down there.
[02:17:54.197 --> 02:17:55.398]  They are suffering.
[02:17:55.398 --> 02:17:56.519]  They are dying.
[02:17:56.519 --> 02:17:57.780]  They need all the help they can get.
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:17:58.520]  Exactly!
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:04.525]  How do you make a joke when you're not down there and the President's down there trying to do something, belittling the effort?
[02:18:04.525 --> 02:18:05.286]  What the hell?
[02:18:05.646 --> 02:18:07.327]  This is so entitled!
[02:18:07.327 --> 02:18:10.510]  You talk about the problem being rich white men, I'm starting to agree.
[02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:15.353]  It's Joe Scarborough, the disconnected, blue-blood piece of crap.
[02:18:15.353 --> 02:18:16.914]  He's definitely disconnected.
[02:18:16.914 --> 02:18:20.056]  And nobody in America is going to side with that guy.
[02:18:20.056 --> 02:18:21.878]  Because nobody is as heartless as that guy.
[02:18:21.878 --> 02:18:24.720]  Does that not show how desperate they are, Kaya, Candace?
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:26.881]  Does that not show desperation?
[02:18:26.881 --> 02:18:27.582]  Absolutely.
[02:18:27.582 --> 02:18:29.083]  It's a lot of hatred.
[02:18:31.257 --> 02:18:32.018]  You mean they didn't win?
[02:18:39.341 --> 02:18:40.842]  It's beneath them.
[02:18:40.842 --> 02:18:42.463]  It shows a lot of hatred.
[02:18:42.463 --> 02:18:47.586]  And again, it just shows that they're hell-bent on making Trump out to be an enemy.
[02:18:47.586 --> 02:18:50.327]  It shows that he can literally do no right.
[02:18:50.327 --> 02:18:52.248]  And I think it's largely embarrassing for them.
[02:18:52.248 --> 02:18:54.229]  It's embarrassing for the people that they support.
[02:18:54.229 --> 02:18:55.830]  And it shows why Trump won.
[02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:58.632]  Because they're acting like children on air.
[02:18:58.632 --> 02:19:01.253]  They're no longer even commentating politically.
[02:19:01.253 --> 02:19:03.374]  They're just there to make fun of him every single day.
[02:19:03.374 --> 02:19:04.575]  And people are exhausted with it.
[02:19:06.383 --> 02:19:08.806]  Don't they get that everybody roots for the underdog?
[02:19:08.806 --> 02:19:11.649]  Even if Trump wasn't as good as he is, people would still root for him.
[02:19:11.649 --> 02:19:20.340]  He's doing a lot of great work, but the way they pile on him and his family and on those of you that, all of you have been persecuted just because you want to make America great again.
[02:19:21.281 --> 02:19:22.142]  That's right.
[02:19:22.142 --> 02:19:23.243]  That's right.
[02:19:23.243 --> 02:19:24.804]  And they're not going to stop.
[02:19:24.804 --> 02:19:27.126]  I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[02:19:27.126 --> 02:19:29.428]  But that doesn't mean we're not going to get better.
[02:19:29.428 --> 02:19:30.289]  That's the thing.
[02:19:30.289 --> 02:19:33.912]  The more they push us, the more they attack us, the better we must become.
[02:19:33.912 --> 02:19:36.875]  We're 10 times stronger than them, 10 times smarter than them.
[02:19:36.875 --> 02:19:41.679]  And I'm telling you, Trump is going to win in a landslide 2020 because of this nonsense.
[02:19:42.339 --> 02:19:43.039]  Oh yeah.
[02:19:43.039 --> 02:19:43.519]  That's right.
[02:19:43.519 --> 02:19:47.521]  I know that Joy Vila and of course Kaia Jones have to go here in about five minutes.
[02:19:47.521 --> 02:19:55.143]  I'm going to come back and spend the rest of this important hour with Candace Owens who also got censored but they had to back off when it blew up in their face.
[02:19:55.143 --> 02:20:01.645]  But going back to Kaia and then of course to Joy Vila, closing comments about what you've witnessed the last few weeks.
[02:20:03.428 --> 02:20:05.870]  Just a magnitude of connection.
[02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:09.232]  The human spirit and the American spirit coming together.
[02:20:09.232 --> 02:20:12.094]  I mean, we saw American flags everywhere.
[02:20:12.094 --> 02:20:16.538]  Each one of these homes that has been completely flooded had to be gutted.
[02:20:16.538 --> 02:20:18.479]  They lost everything.
[02:20:18.479 --> 02:20:22.342]  There was the American flag literally propped up
[02:20:22.962 --> 02:20:29.304]  With all of the things that were now, you know, the gutting of the home, the interior of the home now outside.
[02:20:29.304 --> 02:20:39.728]  So to me, that says volumes of we are united, not divided, no matter whether it's a hurricane or propaganda or pushing narratives that don't exist.
[02:20:39.728 --> 02:20:50.772]  And what, you know, what MSN needs to realize is that when they keep pushing this rhetoric and hurtful comments about our president, they're actually talking about the people that voted him in.
[02:20:51.539 --> 02:20:53.400]  And we're taking it personally.
[02:20:53.400 --> 02:21:02.727]  It's getting to a point where I just don't know how much more they think they're gonna be able to push us against the wall before we eventually just punch back.
[02:21:02.727 --> 02:21:04.348]  Wow.
[02:21:04.348 --> 02:21:05.008]  Joy?
[02:21:05.008 --> 02:21:06.289]  Yeah.
[02:21:06.289 --> 02:21:14.635]  I have to tell you, you know, the pain and suffering, and I echo what Kaya said and what we've seen, the pain and suffering down there is so real and so raw.
[02:21:14.635 --> 02:21:17.717]  The smells, the bodies, the way it's happening.
[02:21:17.717 --> 02:21:19.678]  These people haven't had food for weeks, some of them,
[02:21:19.918 --> 02:21:22.919]  It's our first hot meal and we got to deliver it to them.
[02:21:22.919 --> 02:21:24.480]  They don't have baby supplies.
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:28.121]  I mean, the babies have been taken out of the water, you know, almost dying.
[02:21:28.121 --> 02:21:42.626]  I mean, this is an emergency situation and for Americans to use this to politicize, for bad Americans, for the media to make it seem like we're all racist and this is the white supremacy and the president's not doing anything is a travesty.
[02:21:43.626 --> 02:21:58.613]  Ali Ebdo, who has the right to do it, I'm not saying blow him up for it, but saying that like, Houston's a bunch of white supremacists, so thank God, and professors at CNN, CNN, New York Times said this is God's vengeance on conservatives, when the city's the most averse in the country.
[02:21:59.306 --> 02:22:01.527]  It's the most disgusting thing I've seen.
[02:22:01.527 --> 02:22:02.888]  It's absolutely evil.
[02:22:02.888 --> 02:22:03.848]  It's decrepit.
[02:22:03.848 --> 02:22:07.310]  And the way we fight that is by showing more support and more love.
[02:22:07.310 --> 02:22:12.132]  If you can go out to Houston, if you can volunteer, if you can donate, we're working with MercuryOne.org.
[02:22:12.132 --> 02:22:13.893]  These people will take everything they can.
[02:22:13.893 --> 02:22:14.933]  They need your help.
[02:22:14.933 --> 02:22:16.634]  And we have to continue the message.
[02:22:16.634 --> 02:22:18.155]  Fight the mass media.
[02:22:18.155 --> 02:22:23.497]  Fight this negativity with love, compassion, unity, and support for our president and for one another.
[02:22:23.717 --> 02:22:31.443]  That's right, Kaia Jones, I want to get some comments and joy on this and then we're going to do the rest of the hour with Candace Owens here, censored, but you know, come back like the Phoenix.
[02:22:33.061 --> 02:22:38.083]  Where do you think this goes next, as Joy was saying, the nastiness?
[02:22:38.083 --> 02:22:48.406]  I mean, I'll go out on the street and most folks like me are listeners of every race, color, creed, all human with red blood, but the left comes over and physically attacks me now, they scream nausea at me.
[02:22:48.406 --> 02:22:49.226]  It's all made up.
[02:22:49.226 --> 02:22:52.167]  Because Joy's saying it's going to get worse.
[02:22:52.167 --> 02:22:53.648]  Do you agree with that and how bad will it get?
[02:22:54.341 --> 02:22:58.084]  I think it's important for us to do what we can.
[02:22:58.084 --> 02:23:04.090]  Like if we constantly, you know, me and Joy were in the middle of, you know, my song was number three, her song was number one.
[02:23:04.090 --> 02:23:09.595]  So at the same time, right this week, and we literally pulled promoting our records.
[02:23:10.155 --> 02:23:12.577]  In this moment to go and volunteer.
[02:23:12.577 --> 02:23:22.765]  So for me, it's like, I don't understand the excuses or why Beyonce's not down there or why a heck of a lot more artists aren't bringing their awareness to the cause.
[02:23:22.765 --> 02:23:29.930]  If everybody is just kind of on this negative, negative, negative approach, I think that we're doomed if we do not fix it.
[02:23:29.930 --> 02:23:32.192]  So going down there to giving back.
[02:23:32.652 --> 02:23:32.832]  Wow.
[02:23:32.832 --> 02:23:33.173]  That's right.
[02:23:49.028 --> 02:23:55.276]  Well, Kaia Jones, you're on fire, because my next two questions were exactly that.
[02:23:55.276 --> 02:24:01.003]  I noticed you guys didn't even come on and talk about your records, despite yours being number three, Joy's being number one.
[02:24:01.003 --> 02:24:05.449]  You guys never even made it about that, but we should celebrate the fact that
[02:24:05.509 --> 02:24:24.919]  Despite all the intimidation, all the censorship, that you guys have only been more successful, despite all the other cowardly people in music and in Hollywood, almost none of them would even dare give to Texas, other than Leonardo DiCaprio to his credit, because they're too afraid to look like they're aligned with the evil white supremacist Texans.
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:27.161]  Exactly!
[02:24:27.161 --> 02:24:41.010]  And that's the thing too, is no matter what happens, it's like we say, it's going to get worse out there in the media, but people are going to start turning off, tuning out, and tuning into InfoWars, tuning into alternative media, because we're providing hope, providing truth.
[02:24:42.811 --> 02:24:44.492]  We're saying, make America great again.
[02:24:44.492 --> 02:24:45.613]  That's what my song sings about.
[02:24:45.613 --> 02:24:49.136]  We can be the hope of every hungry child.
[02:24:49.136 --> 02:24:50.597]  That's what I sing in my song.
[02:24:50.597 --> 02:24:58.283]  Kaya's song, What the Heart Don't Know, is about the army spouse losing her husband because he goes off to war.
[02:24:58.283 --> 02:25:02.306]  I mean, we're singing pro-America music and we're inspiring people to do better and be better
[02:25:02.566 --> 02:25:03.186]  Let's explain.
[02:25:03.186 --> 02:25:06.648]  You guys have the number one, number three songs right now in the country.
[02:25:06.648 --> 02:25:09.670]  And where is the hype and celebration and MSM of you?
[02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:13.432]  It's nowhere because you're not controlled by the big corporate chiefs.
[02:25:13.432 --> 02:25:15.073]  You're controlled by your heart and your mind.
[02:25:15.848 --> 02:25:17.028]  Well, and you know what it is?
[02:25:17.028 --> 02:25:20.370]  It's because we can curate the minds that they want to curate.
[02:25:20.370 --> 02:25:22.130]  It's because you're running your own brain!
[02:25:22.130 --> 02:25:23.911]  You're running your own show, ladies!
[02:25:23.911 --> 02:25:32.874]  Here's the big powerful women that are independent, everybody's looking for, and they're in any coverage of you guys other than the independent media, and despite the fake media ignoring you, you're number one.
[02:25:33.769 --> 02:25:34.249]  That's right.
[02:25:34.249 --> 02:25:35.290]  They can't stop us.
[02:25:35.290 --> 02:25:36.631]  That's the beautiful thing, Alex.
[02:25:36.631 --> 02:25:37.752]  They cannot stop us.
[02:25:37.752 --> 02:25:38.913]  They can say what they want.
[02:25:38.913 --> 02:25:39.913]  They can troll.
[02:25:39.913 --> 02:25:40.654]  They can cry.
[02:25:40.654 --> 02:25:41.354]  They can whine.
[02:25:41.354 --> 02:25:42.976]  They can insult our president.
[02:25:42.976 --> 02:25:44.197]  They can insult our veterans.
[02:25:44.197 --> 02:25:45.618]  They can insult our Texans.
[02:25:45.618 --> 02:25:49.280]  But they will not stop us and we will prevail because we're strong.
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:50.281]  And we're Houston strong.
[02:25:50.781 --> 02:25:51.562]  It's amazing.
[02:25:51.562 --> 02:25:53.182]  Okay, we're gonna go to break and end this.
[02:25:53.182 --> 02:25:55.563]  I know you ladies are going on to your next interview.
[02:25:55.563 --> 02:25:56.384]  I guess you're in Dallas.
[02:25:56.384 --> 02:26:00.185]  You've gotten, you know, a day or so away from the flooding.
[02:26:00.185 --> 02:26:05.127]  But Kaia Jones of KaiaJones.com, Joy Vila on Twitter at Joy underscore Vila.
[02:26:05.127 --> 02:26:08.409]  Other parts, other tidbits you'd like to impart to people?
[02:26:10.106 --> 02:26:11.627]  Just stay strong, Texas.
[02:26:11.627 --> 02:26:18.153]  You know, I think Texas right now should be the priority of the nation to get behind and to support.
[02:26:18.153 --> 02:26:21.156]  They're the heart of America, and it needs to be supported right now.
[02:26:21.156 --> 02:26:22.197]  They need food.
[02:26:22.197 --> 02:26:23.058]  They need clothing.
[02:26:23.058 --> 02:26:24.038]  They've lost their furniture.
[02:26:24.038 --> 02:26:25.239]  They've lost their home.
[02:26:25.239 --> 02:26:29.864]  And meanwhile, you're wanting to spew rhetoric about our Commander-in-Chief.
[02:26:29.864 --> 02:26:35.108]  By the way, he is our Commander-in-Chief, and if he's not your president, then you're not a United States citizen, and you need to get out.
[02:26:35.108 --> 02:26:35.849]  That's my opinion.
[02:26:37.005 --> 02:26:37.645]  Exactly.
[02:26:37.645 --> 02:26:42.807]  And I want to say too is I want to remind everyone like I do on my Periscope, my YouTube, you are a spiritual being.
[02:26:42.807 --> 02:26:43.968]  You're not your circumstance.
[02:26:43.968 --> 02:26:45.088]  You're not your body.
[02:26:45.088 --> 02:26:46.769]  You're not what people tell you you are.
[02:26:46.769 --> 02:26:48.029]  You can affect change.
[02:26:48.029 --> 02:26:49.610]  God has blessed you with gifts.
[02:26:49.610 --> 02:26:54.011]  If you're crying over Texas, get off your ass, get out there, donate, help.
[02:26:54.011 --> 02:26:55.452]  You don't have to sit there and be sad.
[02:26:55.452 --> 02:26:58.333]  Turn off the news and do something about it because you can.
[02:26:58.333 --> 02:26:59.913]  You're gifted with that power.
[02:26:59.913 --> 02:27:03.935]  And I know that America can come back twice as strong and we're doing it right now.
[02:27:04.155 --> 02:27:08.336]  Well, I tell you, the Lord works in mysterious ways, and it's just amazing.
[02:27:08.336 --> 02:27:18.500]  Kansas, we're going to talk about the censorship you've gone through and all the other big stories when we come back, but what is it like for you to see every time they attack, as long as we stand back up, we just get stronger?
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:21.521]  We've been hearing these amazing ladies break it down.
[02:27:21.521 --> 02:27:23.981]  It's just an incredible time to be alive in history.
[02:27:23.981 --> 02:27:24.922]  What's your takeaway here?
[02:27:26.306 --> 02:27:26.806]  Absolutely.
[02:27:26.806 --> 02:27:30.728]  I don't think we're ever going to see anything like this for the rest of our lifetime.
[02:27:30.728 --> 02:27:33.130]  It is an incredible, incredible time to be an American.
[02:27:33.130 --> 02:27:40.494]  It's incredible to see us standing up and fighting the vicious media and the lies, and it's collapsing from underneath them.
[02:27:40.494 --> 02:27:41.154]  And guess what?
[02:27:41.154 --> 02:27:45.116]  I think they absolutely know that their days are numbered.
[02:27:45.116 --> 02:27:47.377]  You don't think Micah and Joe know that their days are numbered.
[02:27:47.377 --> 02:27:49.759]  No one's buying the poison that they're selling, you know?
[02:27:50.559 --> 02:27:51.720]  And it's embarrassing.
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:53.861]  It's embarrassing to watch them time and time again.
[02:27:53.861 --> 02:27:57.123]  I don't know how they do it with a straight face half the time.
[02:27:57.123 --> 02:27:59.905]  But I'm tremendously proud to be an American.
[02:27:59.905 --> 02:28:07.510]  And I'm tremendously proud that we are creating this ecosystem that was once underground and is kind of raising up at this time.
[02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:11.292]  And I'm unapologetically happy about all of that.
[02:28:11.292 --> 02:28:13.093]  So it's great to watch.
[02:28:13.093 --> 02:28:13.934]  Incredible.
[02:28:13.934 --> 02:28:14.815]  I mean, I mean, that's it.
[02:28:16.176 --> 02:28:27.311]  It's not that we're perfect, but we've had a poisonous group of dividers in control, involved in pure evil, their own documents admitted, and now you look at Morning Joe in that video, they look so desperate and pathetic, Joy!
[02:28:28.479 --> 02:28:29.440]  They do!
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:31.302]  They're crying!
[02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:33.223]  They don't even know what they're trying to say.
[02:28:33.223 --> 02:28:34.244]  They're looking at the video.
[02:28:34.244 --> 02:28:36.166]  They couldn't pull up the video.
[02:28:36.166 --> 02:28:37.887]  He's trying to describe the video.
[02:28:37.887 --> 02:28:39.109]  And they've lost the plot.
[02:28:39.109 --> 02:28:40.430]  They've completely lost the plot.
[02:28:40.430 --> 02:28:43.092]  Just like Candace said, they know they're on a sinking ship.
[02:28:43.092 --> 02:28:44.333]  They know they're dying.
[02:28:44.333 --> 02:28:45.915]  They're struggling.
[02:28:45.915 --> 02:28:49.578]  I'm sure all the advertisers are going to start pulling their money and they're going to start looking at us.
[02:28:49.758 --> 02:28:51.139]  And by the way, you're so beautiful.
[02:28:51.139 --> 02:28:52.820]  Your truth is so beautiful.
[02:28:52.820 --> 02:28:53.640]  You don't just look beautiful.
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:54.541]  Your truth is so beautiful.
[02:28:54.541 --> 02:28:55.702]  There's nothing sexier.
[02:28:55.702 --> 02:28:56.422]  It's real!
[02:28:56.422 --> 02:28:58.363]  We're not just selling hype like they do!
[02:28:58.363 --> 02:29:00.325]  They are on a burning, sinking ship!
[02:29:00.325 --> 02:29:01.105]  We're winning!
[02:29:01.105 --> 02:29:04.387]  If we just realize it, that's why they're so desperate!
[02:29:04.387 --> 02:29:04.827]  Oh yeah!
[02:29:04.827 --> 02:29:05.808]  That's right!
[02:29:05.808 --> 02:29:07.149]  Small deer, Alex!
[02:29:07.149 --> 02:29:08.890]  Nobody wants small deer, Alex!
[02:29:09.565 --> 02:29:10.125]  Nobody.
[02:29:10.125 --> 02:29:10.926]  That's right.
[02:29:10.926 --> 02:29:11.446]  That's right.
[02:29:11.446 --> 02:29:13.727]  They only go after us because we're the Lions.
[02:29:13.727 --> 02:29:14.527]  That's right.
[02:29:14.527 --> 02:29:14.927]  That's right.
[02:29:14.927 --> 02:29:16.928]  Well, ladies, please come back more often.
[02:29:16.928 --> 02:29:18.428]  We love you, all of you.
[02:29:18.428 --> 02:29:19.769]  Thank you, Ms.
[02:29:19.769 --> 02:29:20.049]  Jones.
[02:29:20.049 --> 02:29:20.509]  Thank you, Ms.
[02:29:20.509 --> 02:29:21.289]  Vila.
[02:29:21.289 --> 02:29:24.231]  People need to follow you guys and keep the songs at number one forever.
[02:29:24.231 --> 02:29:26.531]  And thank you for all the work you did down there in Dangerous Houston.
[02:29:26.531 --> 02:29:30.893]  We're going to come back to another great patriot in the fight of the mine wars against the bullies.
[02:29:30.893 --> 02:29:35.635]  Candace Owens on YouTube, Red Pill Black on Twitter, at Red Pill Black.
[02:29:35.635 --> 02:29:37.335]  I'm Alex Jones at Real Alex Jones.
[02:29:37.335 --> 02:29:37.796]  Stay with us.
[02:29:37.796 --> 02:29:38.456]  This is a war.
[02:29:40.902 --> 02:29:44.824]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:44.824 --> 02:29:52.748]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:52.748 --> 02:29:58.812]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[02:29:58.812 --> 02:30:08.077]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[02:30:08.077 --> 02:30:10.398]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[02:30:10.618 --> 02:30:11.799]  On the grasshoppers.
[02:30:11.799 --> 02:30:15.022]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money.
[02:30:15.022 --> 02:30:21.728]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[02:30:21.728 --> 02:30:26.212]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[02:30:26.212 --> 02:30:33.639]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[02:30:33.999 --> 02:30:42.446]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasions.
[02:30:42.446 --> 02:30:48.430]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best-case scenario.
[02:30:48.430 --> 02:30:50.832]  Get more information at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:50.832 --> 02:30:51.873]  I'm David Knight.
[02:30:52.952 --> 02:30:54.833]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:30:54.833 --> 02:30:56.874]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:30:56.874 --> 02:30:59.775]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:30:59.775 --> 02:31:05.838]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:05.838 --> 02:31:15.022]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:15.022 --> 02:31:18.304]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[02:31:18.564 --> 02:31:22.549]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:22.549 --> 02:31:30.598]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:30.598 --> 02:31:31.600]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:32.774 --> 02:31:36.718]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:36.718 --> 02:31:40.282]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:40.282 --> 02:31:46.989]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:46.989 --> 02:31:51.174]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:53.416 --> 02:32:04.019]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:32:04.019 --> 02:32:06.079]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:32:06.079 --> 02:32:08.940]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:32:08.940 --> 02:32:10.441]  It's made in the USA.
[02:32:10.441 --> 02:32:17.262]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:32:17.262 --> 02:32:18.523]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:32:19.343 --> 02:32:29.049]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:32:29.049 --> 02:32:45.879]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:32:45.879 --> 02:32:49.021]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:32:49.141 --> 02:33:05.515]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:33:05.515 --> 02:33:10.379]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:10.379 --> 02:33:13.482]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.482 --> 02:33:16.284]  Alright!
[02:33:16.284 --> 02:33:16.585]  You know,
[02:33:18.403 --> 02:33:22.565]  I couldn't be drug away from this live show today.
[02:33:22.565 --> 02:33:35.811]  I did take off yesterday most of the day and I went out to the lake with my family and I was jumping off a 20-foot two-story dock and somehow pulled my back.
[02:33:35.811 --> 02:33:36.851]  So I've been here today.
[02:33:36.851 --> 02:33:38.172]  I've been on air.
[02:33:38.172 --> 02:33:39.012]  My back's pulled out.
[02:33:39.012 --> 02:33:40.453]  I'm not complaining.
[02:33:40.453 --> 02:33:41.694]  This is if I sound a little bit different.
[02:33:41.694 --> 02:33:42.134]  It's because
[02:33:43.553 --> 02:33:46.294]  Every 10 seconds or so I get a big shooting pain up my spine.
[02:33:46.294 --> 02:33:49.876]  It feels like I'm hooked into an electroshock system.
[02:33:49.876 --> 02:33:52.858]  The crew was just explaining this to me.
[02:33:52.858 --> 02:33:55.339]  But wild horses couldn't drag me away because things are so exciting.
[02:33:56.311 --> 02:33:58.352]  The crew was just saying, hey, why don't you plug?
[02:33:58.352 --> 02:34:00.052]  You didn't plug last hour.
[02:34:00.052 --> 02:34:03.113]  And you plugged for like 30 seconds in the first hour.
[02:34:03.113 --> 02:34:07.895]  And we need money to hire more reporters and more crew and stave off the globalists and expand.
[02:34:07.895 --> 02:34:12.457]  So if you want to make a donation and get yourself great products, that's basically what it is.
[02:34:12.457 --> 02:34:16.358]  Towards the fight for the Republic, you can see we've hit pay dirt here.
[02:34:16.358 --> 02:34:19.379]  We're under major enemy attack.
[02:34:19.379 --> 02:34:20.859]  Number one, please pray for us.
[02:34:20.859 --> 02:34:22.260]  Believe me, that's the number one thing I want.
[02:34:23.696 --> 02:34:29.541]  Number two, please spread the articles and videos at newswars.com and infowars.com and all the great guests we have on.
[02:34:29.541 --> 02:34:32.283]  And number three, we've got the best supplements out there.
[02:34:32.283 --> 02:34:35.146]  Most of them are private-labeled, best sellers already on the market.
[02:34:35.146 --> 02:34:37.628]  Then we just discount them 20% on average.
[02:34:37.628 --> 02:34:40.590]  When we do sales, we do it 50%.
[02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:43.353]  And Caveman is going to sell out in the next few weeks.
[02:34:43.353 --> 02:34:45.475]  More doesn't come in until October.
[02:34:46.414 --> 02:34:49.955]  But I want you to try it, and folks have already tried it and love it.
[02:34:49.955 --> 02:34:54.356]  I've given it 4.7 stars, thousands of reviews on third-party sites.
[02:34:54.356 --> 02:34:57.236]  I want you to experience it for half off.
[02:34:57.236 --> 02:35:01.137]  Now, it's always discounted off retail, so it's normally like $40.
[02:35:01.137 --> 02:35:04.458]  It's $30 right now, and it really is $29.
[02:35:04.458 --> 02:35:05.958]  It really is powerful.
[02:35:05.958 --> 02:35:07.819]  It's from chicken bones.
[02:35:07.819 --> 02:35:11.339]  Everybody knows you leave the breastbone in and cook it when somebody's got the flu or whatever.
[02:35:11.339 --> 02:35:12.119]  Well, this is beyond that.
[02:35:12.119 --> 02:35:14.380]  This is a whole bunch of concentrated, organic,
[02:35:15.300 --> 02:35:23.969]  Systems with the chaga mushroom, with the turmeric, with the bee pollen and other superfoods, and people are really taking advantage of this.
[02:35:23.969 --> 02:35:31.716]  I want you to try it, see how great it is, and I'm discounting it to go after the demographic we know is waiting for something to be on super sale.
[02:35:31.716 --> 02:35:32.977]  And it's been working!
[02:35:32.977 --> 02:35:38.262]  Working so good, we'll probably sell out of it in a week or something, and then be sold out of it.
[02:35:38.262 --> 02:35:39.523]  But that's kind of a catch-22 because
[02:35:41.291 --> 02:35:45.815]  We're selling super male vitality concentrated herbs for libido, stamina, energy.
[02:35:45.815 --> 02:35:48.157]  From my own personal experience, it's cold pressed.
[02:35:48.157 --> 02:35:52.121]  For 57% off, with a 20% discount, we sell it all day.
[02:35:52.121 --> 02:35:55.504]  But I wanted to hit the demographic of folks that sit on the fence.
[02:35:55.504 --> 02:35:58.527]  We've never done this in the five years of the history of this product.
[02:35:58.527 --> 02:35:59.467]  We're doing it and
[02:36:00.328 --> 02:36:05.510]  I thought it would take most of the month to sell out when we get more in October, late October.
[02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:07.151]  That's not the case.
[02:36:07.151 --> 02:36:08.952]  At this current rate, it's going to sell out in about a week.
[02:36:08.952 --> 02:36:10.732]  So I'm going to have to end this soon.
[02:36:10.732 --> 02:36:16.215]  SuperMetal Vitality, info or store.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:16.215 --> 02:36:18.836]  X2 is 57% off as well.
[02:36:18.836 --> 02:36:20.396]  And there's a bunch of other products there.
[02:36:20.396 --> 02:36:23.438]  So we've never done sales this deep on these products.
[02:36:23.438 --> 02:36:25.158]  And it's because you respond to sales.
[02:36:25.158 --> 02:36:26.259]  So we're doing it.
[02:36:26.259 --> 02:36:27.539]  Even though on some of these products, we make $5.
[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:34.463]  When you sign up for AutoShip, we lose money on some of these deals because they're an additional 10% off.
[02:36:34.463 --> 02:36:39.747]  But whatever you do, ask yourself in history, is anybody fighting the globalist order?
[02:36:39.747 --> 02:36:42.229]  Is anybody taking action in a more focused way?
[02:36:42.229 --> 02:36:45.711]  I hate to say it, but we are the best there is.
[02:36:45.711 --> 02:36:46.812]  We need your prayers.
[02:36:46.812 --> 02:36:48.073]  We need your support.
[02:36:48.073 --> 02:36:51.815]  We write the talking points of the opposition to the New World Order.
[02:36:51.815 --> 02:36:54.037]  And believe me, we're humble about it.
[02:36:55.316 --> 02:36:56.717]  I thought about this last night.
[02:36:56.717 --> 02:36:59.198]  We're humble about it, so I think the audience fully understands.
[02:36:59.198 --> 02:37:02.059]  We are the front line.
[02:37:02.059 --> 02:37:04.901]  And I don't say that from a power trip.
[02:37:04.901 --> 02:37:12.905]  I got my little sword out, staring down this thing, and we've had a lot of victories, but let me tell you, they're really putting the heat on, folks.
[02:37:12.905 --> 02:37:15.026]  They're putting the boots to me.
[02:37:15.026 --> 02:37:21.289]  My family, myself, and I'm not complaining, I'm just telling you that the enemy knows we're on target.
[02:37:21.289 --> 02:37:24.031]  The information we cover here is crosshairs on.
[02:37:25.188 --> 02:37:26.850]  We are on target.
[02:37:26.850 --> 02:37:28.072]  So please, we need your prayers.
[02:37:28.072 --> 02:37:29.474]  We need your financial support.
[02:37:29.474 --> 02:37:32.498]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:37:32.498 --> 02:37:36.383]  They've cut our funding 95% on YouTube.
[02:37:36.383 --> 02:37:37.925]  They've been banning Paul's videos.
[02:37:37.925 --> 02:37:39.527]  We're not, hey, we just want to get the word out.
[02:37:40.368 --> 02:37:44.512]  But, you know, we were bringing in 50, 60, 70 grand a month.
[02:37:44.512 --> 02:37:46.394]  Sounds like a lot when you got 70 employees.
[02:37:46.394 --> 02:37:47.115]  It's not.
[02:37:47.115 --> 02:37:49.577]  Now it's like 10 grand a month from YouTube.
[02:37:49.577 --> 02:37:54.022]  I mean, they banned us off Google Ads six months ago.
[02:37:54.022 --> 02:37:55.624]  So they're chopping us off here.
[02:37:56.264 --> 02:37:59.027]  As they try to take us down, that means take you down.
[02:37:59.027 --> 02:38:03.731]  But the good news is you've increased your support to us directly as this has happened.
[02:38:03.731 --> 02:38:07.755]  So please, keep praying, keep spreading the articles, and keep buying the products.
[02:38:07.755 --> 02:38:08.996]  These specials are about to end.
[02:38:08.996 --> 02:38:09.997]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:38:11.578 --> 02:38:15.421]  20-30 minutes because I held the last guest over, because I held Ted Nugent over.
[02:38:15.421 --> 02:38:20.404]  Kind of like a car wreck or traffic, it just backs up because everybody's so good.
[02:38:20.404 --> 02:38:24.987]  A lot of times I go into the fourth hour that Paul Watson's hosting because it's all just as good.
[02:38:24.987 --> 02:38:31.191]  It's not like I'm going over to the last guest because they're not as good as Ted Nugent or I'm, you know, going over Candace Owens because she's not as good as them.
[02:38:31.191 --> 02:38:34.173]  It's just that it's hard to hang up on these beautiful souls.
[02:38:34.173 --> 02:38:35.754]  So we're going to go to break in about 12 minutes.
[02:38:35.754 --> 02:38:36.535]  You've got the floor.
[02:38:36.535 --> 02:38:40.418]  Let's talk about the censorship you went through, how you overcame it,
[02:38:41.098 --> 02:38:57.913]  But let's recap what we covered last week and the video they censored you did with Paul and I live, radio slash TV, when they set you up, the CIA, Gamergate, how they go recruit men, women, minorities, you name it, with fake racism attacks.
[02:38:57.913 --> 02:38:59.935]  That's incredible testimony.
[02:38:59.935 --> 02:39:03.278]  So Candace Owens, thank you for joining us from Red Pill Black.
[02:39:04.147 --> 02:39:04.668]  Absolutely.
[02:39:04.668 --> 02:39:06.010]  I'm happy to be here.
[02:39:06.010 --> 02:39:06.652]  So let's start.
[02:39:06.652 --> 02:39:07.473]  I mean, where do you want to get?
[02:39:07.473 --> 02:39:08.074]  The hurricane?
[02:39:08.074 --> 02:39:08.876]  What's happening?
[02:39:08.876 --> 02:39:09.737]  The censorship?
[02:39:09.737 --> 02:39:10.899]  How you struck back?
[02:39:10.899 --> 02:39:12.101]  How it all began?
[02:39:12.101 --> 02:39:13.243]  Let's start where it all began.
[02:39:16.082 --> 02:39:33.719]  For me, I was essentially, I always say that I was force fed the red pill because I went and created a company and a woman named Zoe Quinn contacted me and told me that she was a woman that was attacked by anonymous white men on the internet and that if I did not
[02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:37.163]  Pull my company back and defund it.
[02:39:37.163 --> 02:39:42.569]  Pull myself off of a fundraising platform that I was going to be attacked by anonymous white men.
[02:39:42.569 --> 02:39:52.320]  I didn't buy her story and I didn't pull myself off of Kickstarter and within hours I was being attacked by what I was supposed to believe were Trump supporters.
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:40:01.823]  Everyone had this kind of handle, Pro-Trump John or Pro-Trump Joe, and they were saying, you know, nigger, nigger, nigger, die, die, die.
[02:40:01.823 --> 02:40:03.283]  And obviously I'm not a moron.
[02:40:03.283 --> 02:40:05.324]  It was pretty obvious that she had orchestrated the attacks.
[02:40:05.324 --> 02:40:17.327]  And when I came out swinging against her in a public manner on Twitter and I said, I know that she is harassing herself and that she is behind some funded campaign to attack people and try to make them think that it's someone else, I was swiftly
[02:40:18.107 --> 02:40:21.729]  Covered by leftist media trying to smear me.
[02:40:21.729 --> 02:40:30.714]  Basically paint me out as a person who fell for a conspiracy theory, not someone who had actually lived through a girl calling her, threatening her, and then sending trolls on her.
[02:40:30.714 --> 02:40:33.915]  And those trolls were not white men on the internet, they were women.
[02:40:33.915 --> 02:40:42.760]  And I am certain that they were at that time actually being funded by Twitter because she was working as the official anti-harassment campaign chief of Twitter.
[02:40:44.281 --> 02:40:49.532]  Wow, and again, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, they've all been caught.
[02:40:49.532 --> 02:40:52.378]  Mainstream News doing the exact same thing.
[02:40:52.378 --> 02:40:52.559]  Right.
[02:40:53.539 --> 02:40:54.819]  It's beyond hiring actors.
[02:40:54.819 --> 02:40:56.580]  And of course, there are some real racists out there.
[02:40:56.580 --> 02:41:00.021]  They're usually super disenfranchised losers.
[02:41:00.021 --> 02:41:01.981]  They're in their mother's basements, demographically.
[02:41:01.981 --> 02:41:05.762]  They hate everybody, just like the fake left antifas in their mom's basements.
[02:41:05.762 --> 02:41:08.003]  And I mean, literally, the algorithms show that.
[02:41:08.003 --> 02:41:12.664]  They are losers, who I'm sad for, who are blaming somebody else for their own problems.
[02:41:12.664 --> 02:41:18.606]  But in this whole racial division operation, you read WikiLeaks, they say, we're going to use culture war to maintain control.
[02:41:18.606 --> 02:41:19.366]  That means race war.
[02:41:19.986 --> 02:41:23.948]  That seems to be imploding right now, but it shows the boldness.
[02:41:23.948 --> 02:41:32.491]  Since you've gone public about this and reached millions of people with your channel and your riveting testimony, have you had other people reach out to you that have had similar things done?
[02:41:32.491 --> 02:41:34.812]  Because I've done this two times.
[02:41:34.812 --> 02:41:35.512]  We should do it again.
[02:41:35.512 --> 02:41:39.654]  People always get mad at us saying, oh my gosh, then you've got the bots.
[02:41:39.654 --> 02:41:42.915]  Well, we went to Discus, that's a third party.
[02:41:42.915 --> 02:41:46.597]  But we can also maybe try to work with them is why I haven't done this in two years.
[02:41:46.597 --> 02:41:48.778]  I asked IT, I said, why haven't we tracked
[02:41:50.296 --> 02:41:56.579]  IP addresses to show the guys saying, I want to kill all the whites versus I want to kill all the blacks and all these racial names.
[02:41:56.579 --> 02:42:01.701]  We found out where the same groups, the same PR firms, the same bots, they weren't even hiding themselves.
[02:42:01.701 --> 02:42:05.823]  And it's like, because Alex, you got tired of the Secret Service coming because of debt threats to Obama.
[02:42:05.823 --> 02:42:07.184]  You turn it over to third party sites.
[02:42:07.184 --> 02:42:08.565]  So Discus has all that now.
[02:42:08.565 --> 02:42:11.766]  But I we've done the reports where they are.
[02:42:11.766 --> 02:42:15.408]  I mean, obviously, they want to end discourse in a video.
[02:42:16.607 --> 02:42:19.071]  About police brutality or about North Korea, whatever.
[02:42:19.071 --> 02:42:21.514]  They just go in and say N-word here, cracker there.
[02:42:21.514 --> 02:42:22.335]  Right.
[02:42:22.335 --> 02:42:22.716]  To do it.
[02:42:22.716 --> 02:42:22.976]  Right.
[02:42:22.976 --> 02:42:25.180]  So you experience that yourself.
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:25.761]  You speak to that.
[02:42:26.644 --> 02:42:27.264]  Absolutely.
[02:42:27.264 --> 02:42:32.085]  And what I've said and what I've tried to get out there is that they have developed anti-marketing firms.
[02:42:32.085 --> 02:42:39.087]  So they go out and they actively attack people and they try to control the narrative in terms of who the people think that the attacks are coming from.
[02:42:39.087 --> 02:42:44.448]  So for me, you know, with this ominous threat, if you don't do what I say, white men are going to attack you.
[02:42:44.448 --> 02:42:46.128]  And then I say, I'm not going to do what you say.
[02:42:46.128 --> 02:42:50.949]  And then all of a sudden every pro-Trump, you know, troll tries to attack me.
[02:42:50.949 --> 02:42:54.430]  So they are relying on stupidity and they are relying on anonymity on the internet.
[02:42:54.690 --> 02:42:56.311]  They wanted to get you in their stable of mind control.
[02:43:15.561 --> 02:43:16.502]  Right, absolutely.
[02:43:16.502 --> 02:43:17.843]  And I'm just, I wasn't stupid enough.
[02:43:17.843 --> 02:43:29.092]  I understood that the threats weren't real and that they were lying and that they were using this quite literally a white lie to try to get me to come out swinging against white men and grow their forces.
[02:43:29.092 --> 02:43:32.174]  And unfortunately, they picked on the wrong person.
[02:43:32.174 --> 02:43:38.259]  And I am back and I feel it is absolutely my duty to expose this lie.
[02:43:38.259 --> 02:43:41.762]  And now they're pretty scared because after you came on with Paul and I last week, you got censored.
[02:43:42.697 --> 02:43:43.158]  I did.
[02:43:43.158 --> 02:43:52.413]  I got censored immediately after I came on with you guys on YouTube for a video that did not even have one cuss word in it.
[02:43:52.413 --> 02:43:53.435]  Let's talk about what they did.
[02:43:54.750 --> 02:44:08.574]  So yeah, I put up a video basically just not even attacking, I was reading verbatim the list of demands that that Black Lives Matter Louisville chapter member had put out for white people which essentially said, I want your homes.
[02:44:08.574 --> 02:44:11.355]  And you guys are all small D-I-C-K white men.
[02:44:11.355 --> 02:44:16.177]  It was really racist and it was aggressive and it was super ignorant and I wanted to speak out against it because
[02:44:17.017 --> 02:44:21.261]  People like her give African Americans and black people in this country a bad reputation.
[02:44:21.261 --> 02:44:29.369]  And it's important that we stop being afraid of being called coons and stand up and say, no, this is BS and I do not subscribe to this.
[02:44:29.369 --> 02:44:36.216]  And apparently, I don't know, we have suddenly arrived into an era where liking white people or defending white people is unacceptable socially.
[02:44:36.676 --> 02:44:44.503]  So, uh, I received an email from YouTube which just said that my video had been pulled for bullying and harassing.
[02:44:44.503 --> 02:44:46.244]  I did not bully a single person.
[02:44:46.244 --> 02:44:49.006]  I did not comment on the person who wrote the article.
[02:44:49.006 --> 02:44:59.876]  I literally read her list and then said why I thought it was important that black people speak out against it, which basically lets me know that you can be anything you want as long as you subscribe to Democrat thought.
[02:44:59.876 --> 02:45:03.799]  They will always propel you, they'll always give you a voice, always give you a channel, but the second that you get smart
[02:45:04.019 --> 02:45:05.961]  But the good news is you fought back so they backed off.
[02:45:05.961 --> 02:45:07.242]  They're always trying until we just give up.
[02:45:07.242 --> 02:45:07.923]  So it's a war of wills.
[02:45:21.604 --> 02:45:22.104]  Right.
[02:45:22.104 --> 02:45:22.665]  Absolutely.
[02:45:22.665 --> 02:45:28.229]  And credit where it's due, Paul said to me, you need to make noise about it because I was kind of, I was so shocked.
[02:45:28.229 --> 02:45:30.531]  I was like, I don't really know what I should do.
[02:45:30.531 --> 02:45:34.914]  And I just went on a Twitter rant and I spoke about it and I didn't shut up about it.
[02:45:34.914 --> 02:45:41.219]  And I tweeted and I tweeted and I tweeted and four hours later they reinstated the video without so much as an email, nothing.
[02:45:41.219 --> 02:45:48.505]  I appealed it on YouTube and basically told them that this is obviously, you know, just leftist BS and they reinstated it.
[02:45:49.414 --> 02:45:56.159]  Well, you know, I had Ted Nugent on today, and I just called him Sunday, yesterday, and asked him to come on, or two days ago, and he agreed.
[02:45:56.159 --> 02:45:58.922]  I don't ever come up with themes on purpose.
[02:45:58.922 --> 02:46:01.023]  They just come up from what's happening.
[02:46:01.023 --> 02:46:03.485]  And a few months ago, massive censorship got launched.
[02:46:03.485 --> 02:46:04.786]  They admit it's happening.
[02:46:04.786 --> 02:46:05.907]  Everything else was a beta test.
[02:46:05.907 --> 02:46:06.668]  It's here.
[02:46:06.668 --> 02:46:14.814]  But everywhere where people who are big enough complain and have allies that work together to point out it's happening, when Breitbart gets censored, I talk about it.
[02:46:14.814 --> 02:46:16.095]  If Drudge does, I talk about it.
[02:46:16.095 --> 02:46:17.156]  Because that's me, too.
[02:46:17.156 --> 02:46:18.878]  It's not like I'm just such a perfect person
[02:46:19.298 --> 02:46:20.038]  No, I understand.
[02:46:20.038 --> 02:46:22.100]  They get them, they get me next.
[02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:23.140]  Then they've got to back off.
[02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:28.423]  It's only the little guys out there who would become big, they know, who get censored up front.
[02:46:28.423 --> 02:46:30.584]  And Facebook says, you better not post that again.
[02:46:30.584 --> 02:46:31.585]  You better watch what you're doing.
[02:46:31.585 --> 02:46:33.426]  They tell you these messages.
[02:46:33.426 --> 02:46:35.027]  And people self-censor.
[02:46:35.027 --> 02:46:36.267]  This is so cult-like.
[02:46:36.267 --> 02:46:37.908]  This is so anti-American.
[02:46:37.908 --> 02:46:40.009]  This is so North Korean communist.
[02:46:40.009 --> 02:46:41.050]  This is so evil.
[02:46:41.798 --> 02:46:42.118]  It is.
[02:46:42.118 --> 02:46:50.325]  It's absolutely evil and it's fascist and people don't know this but YouTube operates on a three-strike policy so not only did they take down my video but they gave me a strike.
[02:46:50.325 --> 02:46:53.408]  If you get three strikes on YouTube they will pull your channel and delete everything.
[02:46:53.408 --> 02:47:02.395]  For community guidelines when they empower super guideline members that work for them or who they've approved as mods whose vote is a thousand or a hundred to
[02:47:02.475 --> 02:47:02.795]  I don't know.
[02:47:16.491 --> 02:47:16.951]  Exactly.
[02:47:16.951 --> 02:47:18.752]  That's literally verbatim.
[02:47:18.752 --> 02:47:20.913]  That's got to be the best version of events that happened.
[02:47:20.913 --> 02:47:28.476]  All I was doing was calling for unity and saying that somebody putting out something as racist as that list was, was wrong.
[02:47:28.476 --> 02:47:30.297]  And that was apparently unacceptable.
[02:47:30.297 --> 02:47:32.918]  You cannot say that it's wrong to be racist towards white people.
[02:47:32.978 --> 02:47:34.599]  And of course we know what's going on.
[02:47:34.599 --> 02:47:36.740]  It's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the Ford Foundation.
[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:45.124]  They're trying to get white people to become racist, to control everybody with racial division like we're a prison, where there's the black area, the white area, the Hispanic area.
[02:47:45.124 --> 02:47:53.428]  I mean, that's what they're doing, is if enough white people see incredible racism, they'll go, oh my gosh, this is really real, and then they'll fall into it as well.
[02:47:54.168 --> 02:47:55.969]  Right, and they do, they almost do fall into it.
[02:47:55.969 --> 02:48:02.771]  They thank me for the videos and they say, thank you for putting out this video because for a second I was starting to think that every black person thought like this.
[02:48:02.771 --> 02:48:11.113]  That every black person wanted my home, that every black person thought that they were entitled to everything that I worked for because of slavery, which I wasn't even a part of, you know?
[02:48:11.113 --> 02:48:19.996]  And that is why I say, if you are African American and you see something that does not represent us or our culture, it is important that you stand up and say something.
[02:48:21.032 --> 02:48:23.995]  Well, I tell you, Martin Luther King got killed because he wanted unity.
[02:48:23.995 --> 02:48:28.420]  And as soon as Malcolm X wanted it as well, he got killed when he was preaching.
[02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:34.287]  He went through a lot of stuff, and I get why he said what he said, but once he figured out, no, actually, we need to unify, that's when they killed him.
[02:48:34.287 --> 02:48:41.636]  And it's the same thing here today, that we've all got problems and nobody's perfect, but we're being artificially manipulated.
[02:48:42.176 --> 02:48:44.620]  And we've got to admit the globalists are the main issue.
[02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:46.082]  It doesn't mean there aren't issues.
[02:48:46.082 --> 02:48:48.025]  The globalists are manipulating us.
[02:48:48.025 --> 02:48:50.188]  They admit they're manipulating us.
[02:48:50.188 --> 02:48:52.131]  And we need to just wake up from this nightmare.
[02:48:52.131 --> 02:48:54.555]  And it seems like people like you are leading us out of that nightmare.
[02:48:55.245 --> 02:48:55.825]  Absolutely.
[02:48:55.825 --> 02:48:58.988]  And again, my focus is on African Americans.
[02:48:58.988 --> 02:48:59.848]  That's where I come from.
[02:48:59.848 --> 02:49:01.649]  That's where I'm obviously the most attached to.
[02:49:01.649 --> 02:49:10.836]  I know what I've lived through and I understand the struggle of being black, you know, but I also have out thought it and I understand what the real issues are.
[02:49:10.836 --> 02:49:15.919]  And let me tell you, our issues have got nothing to do with white people and everything to do with the leftist agenda.
[02:49:15.919 --> 02:49:21.103]  We have been used like mules over and over again, and it's time for us to stop being sheep and start being lions.
[02:49:22.059 --> 02:49:35.387]  Well, most white people I know are guilty, and they're just working, and they feel bad, and they want to prove that they're not bad people, and then they're manipulated by these spiders that use their good intention to control folks.
[02:49:36.536 --> 02:49:38.697]  Another white folks are just... They're tapping into the white guilt.
[02:49:38.697 --> 02:49:41.179]  They tap into the tree of white guilt, as I like to say.
[02:49:41.179 --> 02:49:41.579]  Exactly.
[02:49:41.579 --> 02:49:45.481]  And then you got others that just will be racist with people and then not be racist.
[02:49:45.481 --> 02:49:47.522]  It's all just fakes like everybody has.
[02:49:47.522 --> 02:49:55.186]  But it is a bunch of globalist, high-powered, old white people in royalty that are using divide and conquer to control all of this.
[02:49:55.186 --> 02:49:57.588]  So at the end of the day, the weird kernel of truth is...
[02:49:58.348 --> 02:50:06.216]  You know, it is some old rich white people that are actually manipulating all this against everybody and that's why they hate people like you so much.
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:07.820]  They do, absolutely.
[02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:15.122]  I'm the first person that they want to censor because they know that the more than my message gets out to black people, black people aren't going to go, oh, well, she must be a white nationalist.
[02:50:15.122 --> 02:50:16.022]  They're going to think twice.
[02:50:16.022 --> 02:50:17.043]  You know, I look like them.
[02:50:17.043 --> 02:50:21.924]  So why am I saying something that is ultimately, if it's ultimately going to hurt me in the end, I wouldn't do that.
[02:50:21.924 --> 02:50:23.784]  That's non-sensible.
[02:50:23.784 --> 02:50:34.427]  So again, I am the biggest threat to them because if I can have a platform and I can speak out against it, then they're going to lose the remaining base of black people that they have.
[02:50:34.747 --> 02:50:35.268]  That's right.
[02:50:35.268 --> 02:50:40.194]  And all this fake racism stuff gives cover to real racists or tribalists.
[02:50:40.194 --> 02:50:43.278]  When we come back, then, what did you think of Trump in Houston?
[02:50:43.278 --> 02:50:45.641]  How do you think the enemy is going to strike back?
[02:50:45.641 --> 02:50:47.443]  That's really the big question we're going to ask.
[02:50:47.443 --> 02:50:49.526]  And Paul Watson is warmed up.
[02:50:50.046 --> 02:50:50.867]  He's in the gate.
[02:50:50.867 --> 02:50:51.647]  He's ready to go.
[02:50:51.647 --> 02:50:54.210]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?

[02:53:40.503 --> 02:53:40.823]  Again, 800-557-0158.
[02:53:57.662 --> 02:53:59.587]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:53:59.587 --> 02:54:03.436]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:24.967 --> 02:54:34.725]  Candace Owens bullies my heart to know there are so many great young people with beautiful souls, beautiful hearts, awake to what's happening.
[02:54:35.984 --> 02:54:51.835]  But I gotta tell you, there's so many other people captured in the bondage of globalist disinformation and looking at what happened in Houston and how that storm that was to be this big tragedy and still is, blew up in the face of the whole fake race war narrative.
[02:54:51.835 --> 02:54:57.759]  And then to watch the demons on CNN and MSNBC so angry and just so pissed.
[02:54:57.759 --> 02:55:00.681]  It's like, gosh, where do they find so many evil people?
[02:55:02.156 --> 02:55:06.419]  So we're winning in many ways, but also I'm just like hurt.
[02:55:06.419 --> 02:55:09.801]  Like, why are there so many bad people?
[02:55:09.801 --> 02:55:14.724]  Well, a lot of greedy globalists got control and they found folks that'll do whatever they're told.
[02:55:14.724 --> 02:55:18.787]  We just have to turn away from these people and promote new independent media like InfoWars and
[02:55:19.502 --> 02:55:23.466]  You know, the work that she's doing over at Red Pill Black on YouTube and Twitter.
[02:55:23.466 --> 02:55:27.810]  Candace Owens, in the few minutes we've got left, because Paul's coming up, I'm going to let him have the whole hour.
[02:55:27.810 --> 02:55:29.492]  I always jump in and take over.
[02:55:29.492 --> 02:55:31.654]  Paul's going to be hosting from England.
[02:55:31.654 --> 02:55:32.575]  Other points you'd like to add?
[02:55:34.403 --> 02:55:39.126]  You know, I just would agree with you that the media circus, it needs to stop.
[02:55:39.126 --> 02:55:40.167]  They need to pull back.
[02:55:40.167 --> 02:55:40.587]  Or don't.
[02:55:40.587 --> 02:55:45.010]  They can keep doing it because at the end of the day, they are absolutely hurting themselves.
[02:55:45.010 --> 02:55:49.353]  And what they have done with or tried to do with the Houston narrative is absolutely disgusting.
[02:55:49.353 --> 02:55:50.594]  What I saw there was beautiful.
[02:55:50.594 --> 02:55:55.297]  What the president did was a phenomenal presidential job.
[02:55:55.297 --> 02:55:56.137]  Exactly!
[02:55:56.137 --> 02:55:57.578]  Why can't they stop then?
[02:55:57.578 --> 02:55:58.999]  We don't even want to hurt them.
[02:55:58.999 --> 02:56:00.100]  We don't want to conquer them.
[02:56:00.100 --> 02:56:01.761]  We just want them to get off our backs.
[02:56:01.761 --> 02:56:02.822]  Why won't they stop?
[02:56:03.582 --> 02:56:16.114]  I don't know, but what I saw was black people, white people, Spanish people, every color, race and creed of an individual coming together in what really was a beautiful display of not just Americanism, but humanity.
[02:56:16.114 --> 02:56:20.798]  And if they can't accept that and love that, then they are just cold people.
[02:56:20.798 --> 02:56:26.023]  And I'm happy to be the part of the growing number of people that are turning them off completely because nobody cares what they think.
[02:56:27.446 --> 02:56:28.467]  Exactly.
[02:56:28.467 --> 02:56:40.013]  Candace Owens, in your gut though, women's intuition, how are the race controllers, who are beyond racist, they just coldly manipulate folks like psychopaths, what's their next attack going to be then?
[02:56:42.580 --> 02:56:46.622]  Something big and over the top like Charlottesville, I'd have to imagine.
[02:56:46.622 --> 02:56:47.463]  They've got it set up.
[02:56:47.463 --> 02:56:59.190]  They've got to get cameras there and they've got to say, well, if you don't believe that the race war is happening, we're going to show you something that never happens and just keep playing it over and over and over again until you are brainwashed to believe that this is your everyday life.
[02:56:59.190 --> 02:56:59.370]  But
[02:57:00.110 --> 02:57:10.452]  I think their attempts are growing more desperate, and every time that they do it, they reveal a little bit more about themselves, and I have full confidence that, as you said and as I've said, people are waking up.
[02:57:10.452 --> 02:57:13.153]  And their days are numbered, so it's nothing that I fear.
[02:57:13.153 --> 02:57:19.934]  Whatever they do, it'll be a big deal in their own echo chamber and nowhere else.
[02:57:19.934 --> 02:57:22.095]  Do they realize they're in an echo chamber?
[02:57:23.300 --> 02:57:24.061]  They must.
[02:57:24.061 --> 02:57:25.642]  I mean, they lost the election.
[02:57:25.642 --> 02:57:29.184]  They said he was going to lose by 80 percent, right?
[02:57:29.184 --> 02:57:30.885]  They had Hillary at 80 percent.
[02:57:30.885 --> 02:57:41.393]  So they must at some point realize that they're in an echo chamber, but they're being paid good money by these globalists to pretend as if they're like actresses, like watching an actress on a show.
[02:57:41.393 --> 02:57:45.516]  I mean, at this point, I can't imagine that they're all this stupid.
[02:57:45.516 --> 02:57:48.738]  I have to hope that they're not all this stupid.
[02:57:48.738 --> 02:57:51.340]  But like I said, they get paid to do that.
[02:57:51.340 --> 02:57:52.581]  And for them, it's just a job.
[02:57:53.703 --> 02:57:56.706]  Bottom line, George Soros is not happy.
[02:57:56.706 --> 02:57:58.928]  Candace Owens, Red Pill Black.
[02:57:58.928 --> 02:58:00.510]  People should follow you on YouTube and Twitter.
[02:58:00.510 --> 02:58:02.832]  Are you going to launch your own website soon?
[02:58:02.832 --> 02:58:03.994]  Because they may censor you there.
[02:58:03.994 --> 02:58:08.298]  Yeah, I just bought the domain name rpblack.com.
[02:58:08.298 --> 02:58:10.020]  I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do with it.
[02:58:10.020 --> 02:58:10.961]  Well, you're awesome.
[02:58:10.961 --> 02:58:11.962]  Hey, you're amazing.
[02:58:11.962 --> 02:58:13.724]  We want you to be a contributor to InfoWars.
[02:58:14.344 --> 02:58:15.225]  I love you.
[02:58:15.225 --> 02:58:16.365]  Well, we love you.
[02:58:16.365 --> 02:58:17.466]  Let's talk soon.
[02:58:17.466 --> 02:58:18.667]  Let's keep you flowing down to Austin.
[02:58:18.667 --> 02:58:20.027]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:20.027 --> 02:58:20.368]  All right.
[02:58:20.368 --> 02:58:21.308]  Have a good one.
[02:58:21.308 --> 02:58:21.728]  You bet.
[02:58:21.728 --> 02:58:23.129]  I am not going to censor Paul.
[02:58:23.129 --> 02:58:24.650]  I'm always jumping in.
[02:58:24.650 --> 02:58:28.372]  If his Skype's working, he will host the fourth hour entirely.
[02:58:28.372 --> 02:58:29.373]  We'll find out, though.
[02:58:29.373 --> 02:58:31.214]  Will I be back in 70 seconds?
[02:58:31.214 --> 02:58:32.074]  Let's see.
[02:58:32.074 --> 02:58:34.035]  Whatever you do, spread the link.
[02:58:34.035 --> 02:58:35.916]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:35.916 --> 02:58:36.357]  Look!
[02:58:36.357 --> 02:58:37.337]  It's Paul Watson!
[02:58:37.337 --> 02:58:37.737]  Look!
[02:58:37.737 --> 02:58:39.678]  Look, there he is!
[02:58:39.678 --> 02:58:40.239]  There he is!
[02:58:42.168 --> 02:58:49.696]  As most of you already know, more than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:58:49.696 --> 02:59:02.689]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, a bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:59:02.689 --> 02:59:06.012]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:59:06.312 --> 02:59:13.315]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:59:13.315 --> 02:59:26.160]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:59:26.160 --> 02:59:27.721]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:59:28.021 --> 02:59:34.403]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:59:34.403 --> 02:59:39.324]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:59:39.324 --> 02:59:40.864]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.221 --> 03:00:02.304]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:00:02.304 --> 03:00:05.868]  Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.868 --> 03:00:08.451]  We are live.
[03:00:08.451 --> 03:00:10.673]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.673 --> 03:00:19.362]  We have a special guest coming up at the bottom of the hour to talk about YouTube censorship and how it's being implemented and why it's being implemented.
[03:00:20.126 --> 03:00:22.167]  First off, we're going to hit some news stories, though.
[03:00:22.167 --> 03:00:25.289]  Of course, we're living in a time of mass hysteria.
[03:00:25.289 --> 03:00:31.633]  The media has contrived this moral panic over white supremacists, over neo-Nazis, over racists.
[03:00:31.633 --> 03:00:37.376]  They're doubling down on the same identity politics that lost them the election.
[03:00:37.376 --> 03:00:40.278]  In fact, Salon.com came out with an article a few days ago
[03:00:40.868 --> 03:00:47.114]  It's basically saying it's time for progressives to give up on identity politics because it's not working.
[03:00:47.114 --> 03:00:50.477]  The response to that article was vehement to say the least.
[03:00:50.477 --> 03:01:05.070]  The very top comment was from somebody who is obsessed with identity politics saying that this opinion was just the writer expressing his white privilege so they still don't get it even though it's been an electoral failure over and over again.
[03:01:05.874 --> 03:01:12.956]  They're still doubling down on race obsession and identity politics, which we should welcome because it doesn't work for them.
[03:01:12.956 --> 03:01:14.357]  It doesn't resonate.
[03:01:14.357 --> 03:01:19.018]  It doesn't substitute for having actual policies, for having an actual argument.
[03:01:19.018 --> 03:01:21.179]  But they're still running with it.
[03:01:21.179 --> 03:01:24.880]  And part of that is this contrived mass hysteria, this moral panic.
[03:01:25.780 --> 03:01:37.991]  Of course, which really built up after Charlottesville, now we've got up in Canada, Calgary police saying that if your child listens to heavy metal music, that might mean they're part of a racist hate group.
[03:01:38.675 --> 03:01:45.778]  They actually put out an advisory to parents with a list of behaviours that may indicate your child is part of a racist hate group.
[03:01:45.778 --> 03:01:48.860]  Listening to heavy metal music was one of them.
[03:01:48.860 --> 03:01:52.282]  Another one of them was not being keen on school.
[03:01:52.282 --> 03:01:59.285]  That was one of the characteristics of somebody who's probably maybe thinking about joining a racist hate group.
[03:01:59.285 --> 03:02:00.986]  So we see how this spreads.
[03:02:00.986 --> 03:02:04.107]  We had the whole panic over Nazi haircuts.
[03:02:04.107 --> 03:02:04.668]  Remember that?
[03:02:04.668 --> 03:02:07.269]  When Eric Trump got a haircut and they said he was a Nazi.
[03:02:08.050 --> 03:02:18.295]  Macklemore had to come out on Twitter, the performer, the singer, and apologize for a haircut that he had a year ago because people said it was the new fascist haircut.
[03:02:18.295 --> 03:02:25.618]  He had to apologize for that, even though it's literally the hairstyle favored by the majority of Western males between the age of 18 to 40.
[03:02:25.618 --> 03:02:27.058]  That doesn't matter.
[03:02:27.058 --> 03:02:28.819]  We're having a moral panic here.
[03:02:28.819 --> 03:02:29.780]  This is hysteria.
[03:02:29.780 --> 03:02:31.740]  You have to go along with it.
[03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:32.241]  Because we had CNN.
[03:02:33.772 --> 03:02:44.679]  A couple of weeks ago I published an article saying that basically all Trump supporters, 63 million Americans, including nearly 4 million black people, were white supremacists by default.
[03:02:44.679 --> 03:02:52.924]  We have an article on Infowars.com today, former Bush advisor, former Bush official, says that 100% of Trump supporters are racist.
[03:02:52.924 --> 03:02:56.947]  People have a backlash against that, and he's like, oh my God!
[03:02:56.947 --> 03:02:57.987]  What is going on?
[03:02:57.987 --> 03:02:59.248]  People are angry at me!
[03:02:59.248 --> 03:03:01.990]  Yeah, you just called 63 million people racist.
[03:03:02.589 --> 03:03:05.650]  Of course people are going to have their say on that.
[03:03:05.650 --> 03:03:07.691]  So they're still running with this.
[03:03:07.691 --> 03:03:13.313]  We have Gone With The Wind now being banned in some cinemas because it might offend people.
[03:03:13.313 --> 03:03:19.255]  Even though, literally, that was the first movie out of which a black actor won an Academy Award.
[03:03:19.255 --> 03:03:20.315]  No, we have to ban that.
[03:03:20.315 --> 03:03:22.276]  It might hurt somebody's feelings.
[03:03:22.276 --> 03:03:28.578]  We have artists' impressions of Abraham Lincoln being torn down because that might offend somebody.
[03:03:28.578 --> 03:03:29.979]  That might hurt somebody's feelings.
[03:03:30.797 --> 03:03:32.298]  And now we have this today.
[03:03:32.298 --> 03:03:35.179]  This is out of Campus Reform.
[03:03:35.179 --> 03:03:40.262]  Academic conference aims to de-center English in higher education.
[03:03:40.262 --> 03:03:41.882]  That's right.
[03:03:41.882 --> 03:03:55.629]  They're literally now saying that speaking English is a racist microaggression because the majority of people in the United States of America and the United Kingdom speak English.
[03:03:55.629 --> 03:03:59.811]  And of course, those are the two most racist, oppressive nations on the planet.
[03:04:00.484 --> 03:04:09.510]  Doesn't matter that they're actually the most tolerant, the most welcoming to immigrants, to the point where Europe has basically committed suicide at this point because of its tolerance.
[03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:10.211]  No.
[03:04:10.211 --> 03:04:11.732]  We're racist.
[03:04:11.732 --> 03:04:12.693]  We have to be punished.
[03:04:12.693 --> 03:04:15.575]  And by the way, you have to hand in your research papers.
[03:04:15.575 --> 03:04:17.476]  This is not The Onion, okay?
[03:04:17.476 --> 03:04:22.279]  You have to hand in your research papers in a different language other than English.
[03:04:22.279 --> 03:04:24.101]  Otherwise, you might be racist.
[03:04:24.101 --> 03:04:25.482]  This is an actual story.
[03:04:26.102 --> 03:04:36.305]  Worried that xenophobia and nationalism are on the rise, organizers of a recent academic conference invited... Paul, it's the official Social Studies World Group meeting in Boston.
[03:04:36.305 --> 03:04:40.587]  This is the brains of the brains.
[03:04:40.587 --> 03:04:44.088]  Somebody might... It's Babelism, Paul.
[03:04:44.088 --> 03:04:44.848]  It's Babelism.
[03:04:44.848 --> 03:04:46.049]  They don't want us to be able to communicate.
[03:04:46.049 --> 03:04:46.569]  Sorry.
[03:04:46.569 --> 03:04:47.049]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:48.752 --> 03:04:50.213]  December 23rd, 1776.
[03:04:50.213 --> 03:04:54.194]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[03:04:54.194 --> 03:04:59.196]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[03:04:59.196 --> 03:05:03.998]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[03:05:03.998 --> 03:05:06.639]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[03:05:06.639 --> 03:05:08.700]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[03:05:08.700 --> 03:05:11.641]  At the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[03:05:11.641 --> 03:05:14.662]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[03:05:14.662 --> 03:05:17.323]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[03:05:17.623 --> 03:05:20.764]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[03:05:20.764 --> 03:05:26.345]  And it would be strange, indeed, if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[03:05:26.345 --> 03:05:34.706]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[03:05:34.706 --> 03:05:39.967]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[03:05:39.967 --> 03:05:44.948]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[03:05:45.828 --> 03:05:48.891]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[03:05:48.891 --> 03:05:53.595]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:05:53.595 --> 03:06:04.224]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had
[03:06:04.364 --> 03:06:06.666]  Much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:06:06.666 --> 03:06:13.311]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:06:13.311 --> 03:06:15.873]  And so I set out to develop Caveman.
[03:06:15.873 --> 03:06:27.303]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:06:27.303 --> 03:06:29.685]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.

[03:06:31.166 --> 03:06:33.868]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete
[03:06:34.008 --> 03:06:34.288]  We're good.
[03:06:49.611 --> 03:06:54.314]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[03:07:52.594 --> 03:07:55.435]  We're live!
[03:07:55.435 --> 03:08:06.858]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.858 --> 03:08:18.662]  We were talking about the academic conference in Boston, where they basically said you need to present your research papers in a language other than English, otherwise it might be a racist microaggression.
[03:08:19.389 --> 03:08:28.155]  We're going to have to start presenting this show via sign language from now on because it might offend somebody if we're speaking English.
[03:08:28.155 --> 03:08:29.896]  That is a reasonable argument.
[03:08:29.896 --> 03:08:31.538]  I mean, let's be fair with them.
[03:08:31.538 --> 03:08:36.841]  Listen to the justification that they had for enforcing this policy.
[03:08:36.841 --> 03:08:44.527]  Quote, this is from the article, while English has become a scientific lingua franca that has been favoured in communications and networking across the globe,
[03:08:45.248 --> 03:08:53.202]  It is the official language of just a handful of countries, most prominently the United States of America and the United Kingdom.
[03:08:53.202 --> 03:08:57.570]  And we of course we know they are the most evil, racist countries in the world.
[03:08:58.573 --> 03:09:05.116]  I mean, let's not talk about South Africa where white people are literally being driven off their land and put in cages because of their skin colour.
[03:09:05.116 --> 03:09:06.397]  Let's not talk about that.
[03:09:06.397 --> 03:09:14.921]  Let's not talk about racism in China, which is basically open and part of the culture, where they literally make monkey noises at people who have slightly darker skin.
[03:09:14.921 --> 03:09:16.122]  No.
[03:09:16.122 --> 03:09:16.902]  Don't talk about that.
[03:09:16.902 --> 03:09:19.844]  Talk about the United States of America and the United Kingdom.
[03:09:19.844 --> 03:09:21.925]  The United Kingdom is so racist.
[03:09:22.597 --> 03:09:30.460]  We literally allow in 300,000 new immigrants every single year into a tiny island nation.
[03:09:30.460 --> 03:09:32.381]  That's how racist we are.
[03:09:32.381 --> 03:09:35.803]  That's how bigoted and evil and intolerant we are.
[03:09:35.803 --> 03:09:37.604]  So we need to be punished.
[03:09:37.604 --> 03:09:45.887]  The United Kingdom, white people, William Wilberforce, were literally the first to ban slavery in the entire world.
[03:09:45.887 --> 03:09:51.230]  There are still millions of slaves enslaved across the world, none of them by white people, but forget about that.
[03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:51.810]  We're evil.
[03:09:52.518 --> 03:09:53.959]  We need to be punished.
[03:09:53.959 --> 03:10:01.023]  How dare you speak English in academia in the United States of America?
[03:10:01.023 --> 03:10:03.725]  You dirty, bigoted racist!
[03:10:03.725 --> 03:10:05.946]  You need to comply to this new mandate.
[03:10:05.946 --> 03:10:09.388]  That was the actual explanation they gave.
[03:10:09.388 --> 03:10:10.249]  They went on to say...
[03:10:11.764 --> 03:10:23.989]  They asserted that the current policies of these two countries send a message of insulation and parochialism to the world, explicitly threatening the richness and importance of human difference.
[03:10:23.989 --> 03:10:31.272]  Literally the two countries where everybody who doesn't live in them tries to flock from the third world.
[03:10:31.272 --> 03:10:31.492]  Okay?
[03:10:32.259 --> 03:10:36.001]  So, they're so racist, why is everyone trying to get here?
[03:10:36.001 --> 03:10:37.461]  Have you ever asked yourself that?
[03:10:37.461 --> 03:10:39.402]  But no, we have to be punished.
[03:10:39.402 --> 03:10:41.303]  Nobody can speak English anymore.
[03:10:41.303 --> 03:10:47.945]  In fact, they should probably have mandatory re-education centres where everybody has to learn Chinese, Spanish, whatever.
[03:10:47.945 --> 03:10:49.746]  Swahili.
[03:10:49.746 --> 03:10:52.167]  Because God forbid, we should be called racist.
[03:10:52.167 --> 03:10:54.408]  Just cut out our tongues and, you know, save some time.
[03:10:54.408 --> 03:10:56.309]  I mean, come on.
[03:10:56.309 --> 03:10:58.030]  Don't be a bigot.
[03:10:58.030 --> 03:11:00.351]  So that's what's going on in colleges in the United States.
[03:11:00.351 --> 03:11:01.091]  We also have this.
[03:11:02.466 --> 03:11:07.730]  College to offer thrice-weekly cuddles with therapy dogs.
[03:11:07.730 --> 03:11:08.691]  Again, not the onion.
[03:11:08.691 --> 03:11:11.333]  Would have been the onion 15 years ago, not anymore.
[03:11:11.333 --> 03:11:16.838]  The University of North Texas now offers students weekly healing sessions with therapy dogs.
[03:11:16.838 --> 03:11:31.350]  According to an advertisement for the therapeutic sessions put out by the University's Counseling and Testing Services Department, students are invited to join Rockstar the therapy dog for some de-stressing art every Thursday throughout the semester.
[03:11:32.142 --> 03:11:39.447]  So they might have been stressed had they inadvertently encountered a different opinion.
[03:11:39.447 --> 03:11:40.407]  Of course, we can't have that.
[03:11:40.407 --> 03:11:42.208]  Every university has to be a safe space.
[03:11:42.208 --> 03:11:45.150]  They can't be challenged on any of their views.
[03:11:45.150 --> 03:11:49.413]  So these therapy dogs, these therapy puppies have been brought in to help them.
[03:11:49.413 --> 03:11:55.597]  Quote, we provide you with supplies to complete an art project designed to increase self-awareness, compassion and gratitude.
[03:11:55.597 --> 03:11:56.157]  And it goes on.
[03:11:57.210 --> 03:12:04.854]  So they literally bring in a bunch of puppies for them to hug to de-stress as therapy.
[03:12:04.854 --> 03:12:12.218]  Which again goes back to this whole depression thing where now everybody has to have emotional incontinence.
[03:12:12.218 --> 03:12:14.599]  There's no such thing as stoicism.
[03:12:14.599 --> 03:12:18.121]  You have to vent your spleen about every little infraction.
[03:12:18.121 --> 03:12:23.984]  If you see a pocket constitution, you've got to have Play-Doh and, you know, drawing paper like you're three years old.
[03:12:23.984 --> 03:12:24.965]  It's Arrested Development.
[03:12:26.431 --> 03:12:33.076]  No, exactly, and that's the video I made a few months ago, Alex, about, you know, this is the daycare generation.
[03:12:33.076 --> 03:12:38.299]  They weren't given enough attention in daycare, so they've carried it forward.
[03:12:38.299 --> 03:12:44.884]  Now they're being taught at these re-education centres, which are now openly political re-education centres.
[03:12:44.884 --> 03:12:50.528]  We had a story yesterday about how one of the new courses, I think this was also in Boston, was
[03:12:51.329 --> 03:12:58.914]  The resistance course, the anti-Trump course, literally a political re-education, now overt.
[03:12:58.914 --> 03:13:00.775]  They're not even hiding it anymore.
[03:13:00.775 --> 03:13:04.217]  They have the indoctrination that words are weapons.
[03:13:05.017 --> 03:13:06.698]  So that's how they ban free speech.
[03:13:06.698 --> 03:13:14.163]  That's not just an opposing argument, it's literally a weapon that is going to sprout fists and start attacking me.
[03:13:14.163 --> 03:13:20.107]  So they have colouring crayons, they have puppies that they can hug, and it's all part of this insanity.
[03:13:20.107 --> 03:13:24.310]  But remember, these people are coming out of these colleges, they're getting jobs.
[03:13:24.930 --> 03:13:30.800]  Through all the diversity hires so they can get a job even though they got some useless degree in general.
[03:13:30.800 --> 03:13:35.046]  Reality winner, top secret clearance, Al Qaeda operative.
[03:13:36.431 --> 03:13:43.055]  They have diversity hires, Alex, where you don't need to have the skills, you don't need to have the qualifications anymore.
[03:13:43.055 --> 03:13:52.701]  If you can claim to be part of an oppressed group, maybe it's a transgender person, maybe it's just a woman, maybe you can claim you're a quartered Swahili or whatever.
[03:13:52.701 --> 03:13:59.405]  You're oppressed, you've got some oppression Olympics points, they will hire you even though you don't have the skills to do the job.
[03:14:00.063 --> 03:14:04.810]  That's what many of these Conservatives are in Silicon Valley coming out and saying.
[03:14:04.810 --> 03:14:11.220]  They're increasingly working with people who obviously don't have the skills to do the job.
[03:14:11.220 --> 03:14:15.646]  They do have the skills to censor people on the internet for having a different opinion.
[03:14:16.347 --> 03:14:20.753]  Hence, we have the YouTube Heroes Program, where people mass flag content.
[03:14:20.753 --> 03:14:27.821]  Hence, we have the new Limited State Program, where controversial opinions are hidden behind an electronic Berlin Wall.
[03:14:27.821 --> 03:14:28.862]  So we know the future.
[03:14:28.862 --> 03:14:34.289]  During the robot takeover, they'll have little liberal helpers blocking humans from fighting back.
[03:14:34.289 --> 03:14:34.850]  This is the plan.
[03:14:36.448 --> 03:14:44.441]  Yeah, so when we, you know, we deride these people on a daily basis, the point is they're coming out of those colleges, they're being given positions of power.
[03:14:44.441 --> 03:14:47.146]  These are the people who they want to run your life.
[03:14:47.873 --> 03:14:52.995]  So again, there's this, there's this, um, you know, backlash to this, which says, oh, that's just complete idiocy.
[03:14:52.995 --> 03:14:54.836]  Why are you even paying attention to it?
[03:14:54.836 --> 03:14:58.138]  No, these are your new rulers.
[03:14:58.138 --> 03:15:04.281]  They just cost us $15 million this year, cutting us off, demonetizing us and blocking us on Google.
[03:15:04.281 --> 03:15:05.821]  What the hell do you mean we're bitching?
[03:15:05.821 --> 03:15:06.782]  They're running the whole show!
[03:15:08.098 --> 03:15:27.548]  Exactly, and then they go out and start, you know, throwing water on disabled people, attacking women with American flags, pepper-spraying women in the face, and big Hollywood celebrities, big mainstream media outlets come out and say, yes, this is moral, we support these people, we support these ski-mask-wearing, chicken-necked thugs.
[03:15:27.548 --> 03:15:32.030]  Oh, and by the way, they're just like the brave soldiers who landed on the beach at Normandy.
[03:15:32.981 --> 03:15:42.846]  Literally, they came out and said that a few weeks ago, Alex, of course, since some of them have backed away now, because on the face of it, it was so patently absurd.
[03:15:42.846 --> 03:15:45.968]  But these are the people who are now going to be running your lives.
[03:15:45.968 --> 03:15:48.389]  You know, we're going to skip this break in the 50s.
[03:15:48.389 --> 03:15:51.691]  You have more time, even though I popped in, Paul.
[03:15:51.691 --> 03:15:53.452]  I am sitting here eating my lunch, watching you, though.
[03:15:53.452 --> 03:15:55.794]  This is really powerful.
[03:15:55.794 --> 03:16:00.156]  These are the people who we talk about terror attacks, the backlash to terror attacks.
[03:16:00.885 --> 03:16:04.427]  Barcelona, of course, happened a few weeks ago.
[03:16:04.427 --> 03:16:11.750]  Now it's moved beyond the stage of changing your Facebook profile picture, tweeting pray for whatever city, fill in the blank.
[03:16:11.750 --> 03:16:18.713]  They actually reacted to the Barcelona terror attack, and this goes back to the infantilization of young people,
[03:16:19.412 --> 03:16:39.723]  By insisting that nobody share images of the attack, even if they weren't explicitly gory images, which by the way people need to see, the consequences of the policies that they have advocated, just any image of the attack, like emergency vehicles or whatever, they insisted nobody do that and instead everybody share pictures of cats.
[03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:44.055]  On Twitter, in the immediate aftermath of the Barcelona terror attack.
[03:16:44.055 --> 03:16:47.139]  This is pre-AI probing for the global takeover.
[03:16:47.139 --> 03:16:52.086]  They're trying to turn off our life force instinct, Paul.
[03:16:52.086 --> 03:16:53.668]  Yeah, they've literally bred this
[03:16:54.972 --> 03:16:59.034]  Toys out of the pram generation, ostrich-like behavior.
[03:16:59.034 --> 03:17:01.855]  Now they can't even deflect from it.
[03:17:01.855 --> 03:17:04.756]  They can't even like pander to the emotional aspect of it.
[03:17:04.756 --> 03:17:06.497]  They can't even handle that anymore.
[03:17:06.497 --> 03:17:10.119]  It's like, no, everybody just start posting pictures of cats.
[03:17:10.119 --> 03:17:11.700]  That's how we're going to deal with it.
[03:17:11.700 --> 03:17:17.442]  Literally like sticking their fingers in their ears and going, wow, that's actually what's going on now.
[03:17:17.442 --> 03:17:19.143]  So they've moved beyond that stage.
[03:17:19.961 --> 03:17:23.484]  And now we see the mass hysteria kicking in.
[03:17:23.484 --> 03:17:29.848]  There was a great post a few days ago which was called a handy guide to the language of the alt-left.
[03:17:29.848 --> 03:17:32.610]  And this is literally what they've embraced.
[03:17:32.610 --> 03:17:34.772]  People have made memes about it.
[03:17:34.772 --> 03:17:37.254]  Here's the guide, here's the language guide to the alt-left.
[03:17:37.254 --> 03:17:38.815]  Fascist.
[03:17:38.815 --> 03:17:40.196]  Someone I disagree with.
[03:17:40.968 --> 03:17:41.930]  Nazi.
[03:17:41.930 --> 03:17:44.054]  Someone I really disagree with.
[03:17:44.054 --> 03:17:45.537]  White supremacist.
[03:17:45.537 --> 03:17:48.522]  Someone I disagree with, who is white.
[03:17:48.522 --> 03:17:49.925]  Internalized misogyny.
[03:17:49.925 --> 03:17:52.028]  Someone I disagree with, who is a woman.
[03:17:52.646 --> 03:17:54.107]  Low information voter.
[03:17:54.107 --> 03:17:57.250]  Someone I disagree with who is working class.
[03:17:57.250 --> 03:17:57.970]  Xenophobe.
[03:17:57.970 --> 03:18:00.692]  Someone I disagree with about immigration.
[03:18:00.692 --> 03:18:01.633]  Islamophobe.
[03:18:01.633 --> 03:18:03.975]  Someone I disagree with about Islam.
[03:18:03.975 --> 03:18:04.916]  Transphobe.
[03:18:04.916 --> 03:18:08.158]  Someone I disagree with who understands biology.
[03:18:08.158 --> 03:18:10.200]  Post-truth world.
[03:18:10.200 --> 03:18:13.062]  I can't believe how many people disagree with me.
[03:18:13.917 --> 03:18:21.680]  So literally, you go down the line, it boils down to that point, anyone who disagrees with me is a Nazi.
[03:18:21.680 --> 03:18:27.762]  Now you've got actual never-Trumpers, ex-Bush people coming out and basically using that argument as we talk about it.
[03:18:27.762 --> 03:18:31.103]  Oh yeah, the new guy coming out saying all Trump supporters are Nazis.
[03:18:31.103 --> 03:18:33.544]  Your article's up on InfoWars.com, but here's the deal.
[03:18:33.544 --> 03:18:38.786]  You keep saying, God, they're crazy, but you expose it in your videos about the CIA and architecture and art.
[03:18:38.786 --> 03:18:39.646]  They know this!
[03:18:40.106 --> 03:18:41.548]  This is weaponized.
[03:18:41.548 --> 03:18:43.331]  They know it doesn't make sense.
[03:18:43.331 --> 03:18:44.652]  It's weaponized, Paul.
[03:18:44.652 --> 03:18:48.538]  So how do we get the public to admit it's not an intellectual debate about left versus right?
[03:18:48.538 --> 03:18:50.721]  This is scientific brainwashing.
[03:18:52.628 --> 03:18:57.410]  Well, it is weaponized, and it's not the fight that people are just melting down and becoming hysterical.
[03:18:57.410 --> 03:19:06.113]  It's designed to be this way, because that is the Marxist goal, to overthrow everything that is in existence, whether good or bad.
[03:19:06.113 --> 03:19:12.215]  We're talking about the entire Western capitalist system, the entire Enlightenment set of values.
[03:19:12.215 --> 03:19:12.715]  Exactly.
[03:19:12.715 --> 03:19:14.296]  We don't defend all of it.
[03:19:14.296 --> 03:19:15.996]  This is an overwrite.
[03:19:15.996 --> 03:19:19.117]  They admit it's a total overwrite.
[03:19:19.117 --> 03:19:19.498]  Exactly.
[03:19:21.016 --> 03:19:27.717]  Whether they're aware of it or not, the more dominant force that will come in and start to run everything will be Islam.
[03:19:27.717 --> 03:19:32.298]  Because it's dominant, it's aggressive, they will take over whether they like it or not.
[03:19:32.298 --> 03:19:40.960]  Maybe not in the United States, or it may take a long time, but in Europe that's already happening, and that's why they're now just capitulating and teaming up with it.
[03:19:40.960 --> 03:19:45.461]  We had an article out of Germany today, and we've seen this before.
[03:19:45.461 --> 03:19:50.122]  Germany, police tell women not to run alone after migrant rapes jogger in park.
[03:19:50.723 --> 03:19:55.308]  So you had a woman in her fifties jogging on a Friday morning.
[03:19:55.308 --> 03:19:58.372]  It's not as if this was late at night, which would be no excuse.
[03:19:58.372 --> 03:20:00.294]  You may understand that an attack would be more likely.
[03:20:00.294 --> 03:20:03.277]  Yes, Cologne last year said, don't wear hot skirts.
[03:20:03.277 --> 03:20:05.760]  We're going to ban Germans drinking outside at night.
[03:20:05.760 --> 03:20:06.922]  So more capitulation.
[03:20:08.598 --> 03:20:16.749]  Yeah, remember the mayor in Cologne after the mass molestation of literally 1,200 women by 2,000 men, almost all of whom were Muslim migrants?
[03:20:16.749 --> 03:20:23.517]  She came out and said, hold the rapist at arm's length and walk around in groups and that's how you deal with it.
[03:20:23.517 --> 03:20:25.019]  They literally gave the same advice.
[03:20:25.019 --> 03:20:25.280]  They said,
[03:20:26.020 --> 03:20:43.345]  Women need to start jogging in pairs, or they need to make sure that someone else is around, and get this, this is a quote, when they run past someone, this is the police in Germany, when they run past someone, joggers should always look back to make sure they are not about to be attacked.
[03:20:43.345 --> 03:20:47.206]  So it's literally, you have to constantly look behind your shoulder.
[03:20:47.206 --> 03:20:51.347]  And they also have a little, remember the right things in German?
[03:20:51.347 --> 03:20:52.868]  Don't rape me, rape bracelets?
[03:20:54.127 --> 03:21:00.792]  Yeah, and I think it was in Finland they had the force where it was literally holding their arms out and telling them to back off.
[03:21:00.792 --> 03:21:06.016]  But again, as he said, this is capitulation to Islamic modesty culture.
[03:21:06.016 --> 03:21:07.577]  It's worse than that, Paul.
[03:21:07.577 --> 03:21:11.661]  The mayor of Cologne said, you're wearing too short of skirts, honey.
[03:21:11.661 --> 03:21:13.462]  And she's like this fake Green Party feminist.
[03:21:13.462 --> 03:21:14.883]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:21:14.883 --> 03:21:19.167]  And the day after, all the feminists went out to the local migrant center and gave them roses.
[03:21:20.837 --> 03:21:26.260]  After 1,200 women have been molested by migrants, so that's how the feminists responded.
[03:21:26.260 --> 03:21:45.992]  But yeah, it's this capitulation to Islamic modesty culture, while they bring in hundreds of thousands of people a year from a culture that produced something literally called the rape game, which we've seen, you know, Laura Logan was a victim of it in Tahir Square, where they literally just mass molest women because they're not covered up.
[03:21:45.992 --> 03:21:50.275]  Let's talk about the rape game and how you're anti-Islam if you don't support rape.
[03:21:51.738 --> 03:21:52.218]  Exactly.
[03:21:52.218 --> 03:22:02.701]  And also, of course, in Afghanistan, US troops blew the whistle on Bacha Barzi, which is where the old men in Afghanistan get to rape little boys.
[03:22:02.701 --> 03:22:05.561]  And it's OK, because it's just part of their culture.
[03:22:05.561 --> 03:22:09.102]  And of course, many of the migrants coming over are from Afghanistan.
[03:22:09.102 --> 03:22:14.544]  You see boys at swimming pools being molested, being raped, and the migrants respond.
[03:22:14.544 --> 03:22:17.144]  They wait around for the police to come, by the way.
[03:22:17.144 --> 03:22:19.885]  It's not like they actually think they've even done anything wrong.
[03:22:20.465 --> 03:22:21.205]  I don't think so.
[03:22:39.640 --> 03:22:40.781]  Lifeguards.
[03:22:40.781 --> 03:22:46.803]  They're hiring Muslim migrants as lifeguards to deal with the fact that people are being molested in swimming pools.
[03:22:46.803 --> 03:22:51.265]  So it's not, let's deal with these people who are all responsible for all the molestation.
[03:22:51.265 --> 03:22:58.789]  No, let's give them positions of authority at the very places where those sexual assaults are taking place.
[03:22:58.789 --> 03:23:00.670]  This is the insanity that's gripping Europe.
[03:23:00.670 --> 03:23:01.970]  This is the capitulation.
[03:23:01.970 --> 03:23:04.972]  Total capitulation!
[03:23:04.972 --> 03:23:07.553]  And we have another article out of Breitbart today, Alex.
[03:23:08.476 --> 03:23:13.162]  Swedish summer festivals see over 150 sex attacks, 20 rapes this year.
[03:23:13.162 --> 03:23:14.884]  This is getting even worse.
[03:23:14.884 --> 03:23:24.596]  The summer festival season in Sweden is over for the year, but reports claim that there are over 150 cases of sex attacks, including 20 rapes at various festivals around the country.
[03:23:24.596 --> 03:23:27.880]  But Merkel says if we make whole towns Muslim, that'll fix it.
[03:23:29.369 --> 03:23:35.273]  Yeah, they literally deluged villages of 150 people with like 700 migrants and said, just deal with it.
[03:23:35.273 --> 03:23:39.817]  Oh, and by the way, if you complain about it on Facebook, we'll send police round to your house.
[03:23:39.817 --> 03:23:40.857]  That's freedom!
[03:23:40.857 --> 03:23:42.258]  That's freedom, Alex.
[03:23:42.258 --> 03:23:44.160]  So now we've got this situation in Sweden.
[03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:50.705]  We had, um, three years ago, massive cover-up by the police that the fact that these sexual assaults were taking place.
[03:23:50.705 --> 03:23:56.669]  In some cases, literally women being raped in the middle of a field while a concert is going on around them.
[03:23:57.229 --> 03:23:58.330]  This is spiking.
[03:23:58.330 --> 03:24:02.253]  There were a total of 150 sex assaults at the... And I dare folks to watch those videos.
[03:24:02.253 --> 03:24:04.175]  Those videos gave me nightmares.
[03:24:04.175 --> 03:24:07.857]  Where they hold a woman down and like 40 guys line up and rape the hell out of her.
[03:24:07.857 --> 03:24:09.319]  And the cops stand by and watch.
[03:24:09.319 --> 03:24:11.580]  Good Lord!
[03:24:11.580 --> 03:24:13.061]  Absolutely chilling.
[03:24:13.061 --> 03:24:16.584]  Meanwhile, over in the UK, we talked about this story last week.
[03:24:16.584 --> 03:24:19.807]  Now it's being picked up more widely, more detail on it.
[03:24:19.807 --> 03:24:26.692]  Student probed by uni bosses for hate crime after calling ISIS barbarians in mocking Facebook posts.
[03:24:27.395 --> 03:24:29.898]  This is the guy at Edinburgh University.
[03:24:29.898 --> 03:24:33.723]  Let's read exactly what he posted on Facebook.
[03:24:33.723 --> 03:24:39.870]  So this was in response to the massive bombardment of an ISIS stronghold in Afghanistan back in April.
[03:24:39.870 --> 03:24:41.953]  You remember that story, the mother of all bombs.
[03:24:42.944 --> 03:24:54.947]  Robbie Travers, who is a 21-year-old student at the University of Edinburgh, wrote in response to that news story, I'm glad we could bring these barbarians a step closer to collecting their 72 virgins.
[03:24:54.947 --> 03:25:08.411]  So he's literally posting about ISIS terrorists being killed, mocking ISIS, and for that he's being investigated for hate crime because that may have offended Muslims.
[03:25:08.411 --> 03:25:10.532]  Okay, so who's the Islamophobia?
[03:25:10.532 --> 03:25:11.432]  The University
[03:25:12.072 --> 03:25:18.281]  Is insinuating that Muslims, all Muslims, would be offended by somebody mocking ISIS.
[03:25:18.281 --> 03:25:20.684]  Oh but wait, I thought ISIS had nothing to do with Islam.
[03:25:21.264 --> 03:25:30.150]  If you want to play it on their level, if you want to get into their narrative, the actual Islamophobia is being committed by the university.
[03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:31.711]  You can't mock ISIS.
[03:25:31.711 --> 03:25:33.172]  You can't make fun of them.
[03:25:33.172 --> 03:25:34.613]  That's now a hate crime.
[03:25:34.613 --> 03:25:36.374]  He's being investigated.
[03:25:36.374 --> 03:25:43.019]  This is what's taking place in universities in the United Kingdom, while in the US you can't talk English because that's racist.
[03:25:43.519 --> 03:25:44.679]  So you can't mock ISIS.
[03:25:44.679 --> 03:25:47.620]  Meanwhile, ISIS is now sending out a call.
[03:25:47.620 --> 03:25:52.841]  But don't criticize it, because you might- You'll poison supermarket food!
[03:25:52.841 --> 03:25:53.921]  Exactly.
[03:25:53.921 --> 03:25:58.642]  So they literally want to inject fruit and vegetables with cyanide.
[03:25:58.642 --> 03:26:01.442]  They've put it out in their official propaganda manual.
[03:26:01.442 --> 03:26:04.783]  And I guess that is technically a, you know, cultural enrichment.
[03:26:04.783 --> 03:26:11.884]  And if you- And the answer will be a new TSA to test every fruit, every orange, every apple, instead of keeping ISIS people out, Paul.
[03:26:13.715 --> 03:26:25.344]  It technically is cultural enrichment, so if you don't embrace it, you know, somebody somewhere might be offended, Alex, so let's just... So if I don't get to sign on Apple, I'm bad?
[03:26:25.344 --> 03:26:29.627]  Yeah, and don't make fun of ISIS because that's bad, that's a hate crime now.
[03:26:29.627 --> 03:26:33.830]  This is what's taking place in academia!
[03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:35.371]  This is what's happening.
[03:26:35.371 --> 03:26:38.293]  We talk about it every day, and again, these people are taking jobs.
[03:26:38.293 --> 03:26:40.095]  These people are going to be ruling your lives soon.
[03:26:40.726 --> 03:26:45.807]  So we've got that going on, we've got the whole... Yeah, because they know there's a billion and a half Muslims, about to be three billion in ten years.
[03:26:45.807 --> 03:26:47.988]  They're having like seven kids on average.
[03:26:47.988 --> 03:26:49.708]  The globalists think this is a winning formula.
[03:26:49.708 --> 03:27:00.391]  They're really going to make us all eat cyanide oranges and put burkas on top of our little girdles and chop our genitals off with loppers and just run around screaming Durka Durka Muhammad Jihad.
[03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:24.269]  Well, I mean, the thing about Europe now, Alex, and if you read The Strange Death of Europe, which is a new book by Douglas Murray, even if they stopped all Islamic immigration coming into Europe now, and there was never any more, even if they stopped it all, demographically, they would still be the majority within, in certain countries, within our lifetimes.
[03:27:24.269 --> 03:27:25.770]  That's with even stopping all immigration.
[03:27:25.770 --> 03:27:26.110]  That's right.
[03:27:26.110 --> 03:27:30.354]  Have you seen the EU Vice President say, just get used to it, we're getting rid of all the European countries?
[03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:36.014]  Yeah, I mean they get up in front of Parliament and say Germans will be a minority and that's a good thing.
[03:27:36.014 --> 03:27:39.176]  You will die out and that's a good thing and we'll celebrate it.
[03:27:39.176 --> 03:27:40.357]  But it's going to happen.
[03:27:40.357 --> 03:27:45.922]  Sweden, ethnic Swedes will be a minority within our lifetimes in Sweden.
[03:27:45.922 --> 03:27:49.585]  I'm not just talking about capital cities, I'm talking about the entire country.
[03:27:49.585 --> 03:27:52.107]  Ethnic Swedes will be a minority.
[03:27:52.107 --> 03:27:53.048]  And of course, who is it?
[03:27:53.048 --> 03:27:55.490]  National Geographic celebrated it.
[03:27:55.490 --> 03:27:57.632]  The New Europeans is a bunch of
[03:27:58.252 --> 03:28:00.674]  Blobs in hijabs and Muslim men.
[03:28:00.674 --> 03:28:01.855]  That's the new Europeans.
[03:28:01.855 --> 03:28:02.395]  Great.
[03:28:02.395 --> 03:28:04.056]  That's something to look forward to.
[03:28:04.056 --> 03:28:10.441]  Again, it's all based on this premise of eroding Western civilization, of making that bad.
[03:28:10.441 --> 03:28:18.166]  Like we've got something to be ashamed of when the entire history of the world is about warring tribes, is about slavery.
[03:28:18.166 --> 03:28:21.688]  Every single major power in the world was involved in slavery.
[03:28:21.688 --> 03:28:23.650]  Many were involved in colonialism.
[03:28:23.650 --> 03:28:25.491]  We were the first to stop slavery.
[03:28:25.991 --> 03:28:35.358]  I mean, even Robert Lee, this Confederate general that they're all, you know, having tantrums about and pulling down statues, he wrote that slavery was evil.
[03:28:35.358 --> 03:28:38.020]  He freed slaves on his own plantation.
[03:28:38.020 --> 03:28:43.865]  So the very worst example, the very worst guy they hold up, even he was anti-slavery.
[03:28:43.865 --> 03:28:50.450]  And since the founding of the country when his father was a top general of Washington, they were trying to figure out a way to end it.
[03:28:50.450 --> 03:28:50.650]  Yeah.
[03:28:51.761 --> 03:28:53.742]  I mean, I've got a whole video about that coming out.
[03:28:53.742 --> 03:28:54.983]  This is his quote.
[03:28:54.983 --> 03:29:04.790]  In this enlightened age, there are few, I believe, but what will acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political evil in any country.
[03:29:04.790 --> 03:29:10.394]  That was Confederate General Robert Lee, who wrote that in a letter to his wife.
[03:29:10.394 --> 03:29:14.236]  And of course, he was the head of the Northern Army, Paul.
[03:29:14.236 --> 03:29:15.117]  He was the head of West Point.
[03:29:15.117 --> 03:29:16.378]  He didn't want to do it.
[03:29:16.378 --> 03:29:17.478]  It was all big manipulation.
[03:29:17.478 --> 03:29:18.219]  You're going to take over.
[03:29:20.020 --> 03:29:23.383]  For the time I popped in, though, we skipped a break, so Paul's good.
[03:29:23.383 --> 03:29:29.367]  We're gonna come right back on the other side of this break with Paul Watson, hosting from Her Britannic Majesty's London, England.
[03:29:29.367 --> 03:29:30.268]  This is Key Intel.
[03:29:30.268 --> 03:29:33.250]  The enemy does not want you to hear this, because they don't want human success.
[03:29:33.250 --> 03:29:34.691]  But we're gonna be victorious.
[03:29:34.691 --> 03:29:37.333]  Newswars.com.
[03:29:37.333 --> 03:29:38.734]  We're on the march.
[03:29:38.734 --> 03:29:41.256]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:41.256 --> 03:29:43.958]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:49.187 --> 03:30:02.256]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[03:30:03.564 --> 03:30:15.553]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[03:30:15.553 --> 03:30:31.845]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[03:30:32.285 --> 03:30:37.289]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[03:30:37.289 --> 03:30:41.513]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[03:30:41.513 --> 03:30:43.234]  InfoWars.com
[03:30:48.061 --> 03:30:57.153]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:30:57.153 --> 03:31:05.284]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:05.544 --> 03:31:10.427]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:10.427 --> 03:31:17.210]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:31:17.210 --> 03:31:24.394]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:24.394 --> 03:31:31.257]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:31.417 --> 03:31:35.899]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:35.899 --> 03:31:39.281]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:39.281 --> 03:31:45.584]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:45.584 --> 03:31:47.265]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[03:31:48.565 --> 03:31:54.032]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:31:54.032 --> 03:31:56.134]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:31:56.134 --> 03:32:01.420]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:01.420 --> 03:32:05.165]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[03:32:05.265 --> 03:32:08.706]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:08.706 --> 03:32:11.886]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:11.886 --> 03:32:15.767]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:15.767 --> 03:32:22.929]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:22.929 --> 03:32:28.330]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[03:32:28.610 --> 03:32:30.652]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[03:32:30.652 --> 03:32:38.942]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spirament was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spirament free.
[03:32:38.942 --> 03:32:47.251]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[03:33:28.172 --> 03:33:29.493]  We're under constant attack.

[03:33:33.576 --> 03:33:44.042]  We're not dependent on outside advertisers that can be targeted with boycotts by intolerant hysterical leftists, which is why we've been able to prosper and are outside of their remit.
[03:33:44.042 --> 03:33:46.483]  But only if you continue to support us by getting the products.
[03:33:46.483 --> 03:33:49.425]  We also have Emric's Essentials line of organic household products.
[03:33:50.327 --> 03:34:05.693]  The Oxide Sunscreen, the Herbal Bug Spray, the Mouthwash, the Body Wash, it's all available for 50% off all Emrix Essentials products right now at InfoWarsStore.com, another massive discount to take advantage of while it lasts.
[03:34:05.693 --> 03:34:08.354]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:08.354 --> 03:34:09.655]  Right, let's go to our guest.
[03:34:09.655 --> 03:34:15.997]  He is, and this is a tough pronunciation, but I'm going to attempt it, StixxHexenHammer666 on YouTube.
[03:34:15.997 --> 03:34:16.177]  He is
[03:34:18.819 --> 03:34:25.186]  By my estimation, one of the smartest commentators on YouTube on such a wide variety of topics.
[03:34:25.186 --> 03:34:27.568]  He's otherwise known as Carl Warwick.
[03:34:27.568 --> 03:34:29.670]  Again, another easy pronunciation.
[03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:32.133]  But Carl, welcome to the show!
[03:34:32.133 --> 03:34:33.054]  Thank you for having me.
[03:34:34.210 --> 03:34:35.031]  Good to have you here.
[03:34:35.031 --> 03:34:36.834]  I'm a big fan of your videos.
[03:34:36.834 --> 03:34:44.225]  Now, I want to get into the technical details of what's happening over at YouTube with their new censorship program, the whole limited state thing.
[03:34:44.225 --> 03:34:47.189]  But first, I want to get into the overarching agenda.
[03:34:47.189 --> 03:34:50.474]  We had Julian Assange, no less, earlier today
[03:34:51.054 --> 03:34:51.834]  Tweet this.
[03:34:51.834 --> 03:34:52.935]  I'm going to read it.
[03:34:52.935 --> 03:34:57.937]  This is where young men not on the left are now getting their social or political education.
[03:34:57.937 --> 03:35:00.278]  This includes people like at Prison Planet.
[03:35:00.278 --> 03:35:01.959]  He also mentioned you, of course.
[03:35:01.959 --> 03:35:12.964]  He's talking about people going to YouTube, people getting their commentary, their information from video content, not necessarily from written content.
[03:35:12.964 --> 03:35:15.005]  He went on to say while the US left,
[03:35:15.604 --> 03:35:28.893]  That was Julian Assange in a tweet earlier today.
[03:35:28.893 --> 03:35:36.698]  You know, Carl, I joked a few months ago that YouTube was becoming a right-wing safe space because the left just can't compete on there.
[03:35:36.698 --> 03:35:38.299]  You've made videos about that in the past.
[03:35:38.299 --> 03:35:39.680]  They get downvoted.
[03:35:39.680 --> 03:35:43.182]  Their videos either get no traction or they get completely trashed.
[03:35:43.817 --> 03:35:52.782]  Of course, you know, it's far easier to spit out a virtue-signalling tweet than to actually take the time to script, dictate and edit a 10-minute YouTube video.
[03:35:52.782 --> 03:36:07.911]  So the question is, you know, how much of this censorship when it comes to YouTube is down to Google compensating for the left's laziness in their failure to resonate with an audience, particularly, you know, particularly a younger audience on YouTube
[03:36:08.591 --> 03:36:19.557]  I think a lot of it is down to laziness because it's a lot easier to virtue signal on Twitter than to actually sit down and craft a YouTube video that's going to resonate with people.
[03:36:19.557 --> 03:36:26.021]  I think that a lot of it is really on the fiscal side as far as Google itself is concerned.
[03:36:26.021 --> 03:36:35.526]  I think they're legitimately worried about advertisers going elsewhere but the thing is they're not going to be able to get any of those advertisers back just by pretending to be moral.
[03:36:35.526 --> 03:36:37.627]  Everyone knows that ultimately it's about the money.
[03:36:38.391 --> 03:36:41.713]  If they didn't have a problem with the ad companies, they probably wouldn't censor anything.
[03:36:41.713 --> 03:36:42.874]  They probably wouldn't care.
[03:36:42.874 --> 03:36:48.418]  They'd put anything on YouTube and allow it to be there so long as it was making them a paycheck.
[03:36:49.544 --> 03:36:55.129]  In so far as that's concerned, I don't think it's really pressure from the left so much as on a fiscal level.
[03:36:55.129 --> 03:36:58.753]  The pressure from the left appears to be brought to bear.
[03:36:58.753 --> 03:37:01.375]  They're going after domain registrars now.
[03:37:01.375 --> 03:37:03.918]  It's not just Google or any Google service.
[03:37:03.918 --> 03:37:06.640]  They've gone after Gab most recently.
[03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:09.463]  They've gone after other sites as well.
[03:37:09.463 --> 03:37:10.764]  Ad firms themselves.
[03:37:10.764 --> 03:37:11.725]  I think what happens
[03:37:12.532 --> 03:37:23.015]  Is that some group of authoritarian leftists that don't want anyone to have a good time, they don't have good ideas, they're like, oh, we can't compete with anybody, we need to lean on the advertisers.
[03:37:23.015 --> 03:37:26.476]  So they use the advertisers, I think, as a form of middleman.
[03:37:26.476 --> 03:37:32.398]  And Google has to be aware of this going on, they have to know that it's going on.
[03:37:32.398 --> 03:37:38.000]  But they're kind of stymied in their ability to respond because they're like, well, we don't want to lose even more money, I suppose.
[03:37:39.778 --> 03:37:40.979]  Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?
[03:37:40.979 --> 03:37:52.811]  I mean, I just don't see that many successful left-wing commentators on YouTube, because they still have a huge traffic on the late-night comedy shows, but in terms of independent content creators, they're just pathetic!
[03:37:52.811 --> 03:37:56.375]  They get owned every single time, and I think that's part of it.
[03:37:56.375 --> 03:37:59.418]  Even like Vice and New York Times came out a couple of months ago and said,
[03:37:59.938 --> 03:38:01.599]  Basically said, yeah, I was right.
[03:38:01.599 --> 03:38:05.661]  The right or libertarians or whoever are completely dominating YouTube.
[03:38:05.661 --> 03:38:09.722]  So I think it is a part of the motivation behind wanting to censor it.
[03:38:09.722 --> 03:38:12.364]  Just getting into the technical details.
[03:38:12.364 --> 03:38:15.065]  Of course, we had this announcement from Google last week.
[03:38:15.065 --> 03:38:20.187]  I believe they would censor offensive or controversial content, which of course is totally subjective.
[03:38:20.187 --> 03:38:21.868]  They introduced this limited state.
[03:38:21.868 --> 03:38:26.870]  Just explain what limited state means and what kind of videos are being censored right now.
[03:38:28.021 --> 03:38:38.271]  Yeah, as far as I can tell from the list of limited state videos, 90% of them are things that technically do breach the TOS, so I'm not even sure why they're retaining it on the platform.
[03:38:38.271 --> 03:38:43.676]  But then you've got the problematic group, which is stuff that doesn't violate the TOS.
[03:38:43.676 --> 03:38:45.078]  Well, why is it in limited state?
[03:38:45.078 --> 03:38:46.219]  It should just be there.
[03:38:46.219 --> 03:38:50.643]  If they're worried about it, then there should be a public debate over the actual content.
[03:38:50.643 --> 03:38:51.464]  I don't even think
[03:38:52.514 --> 03:39:02.787]  To your mention of the left online, there are people on the actual left, as opposed to Hillary Clinton, a neoliberal or something.
[03:39:03.479 --> 03:39:10.982]  That have made it, they're going to get censored too because they actually respond to some of these so-called offensive content too.
[03:39:10.982 --> 03:39:14.283]  They're just oblivious to this fact for the most part.
[03:39:14.283 --> 03:39:18.984]  But what it is, limited state is all about trying to hide things away and it simply won't work.
[03:39:18.984 --> 03:39:21.005]  It's already not worked.
[03:39:21.005 --> 03:39:23.566]  Some of these users posted stats.
[03:39:24.404 --> 03:39:26.586]  On the videos that they had had moved to limited space.
[03:39:26.586 --> 03:39:31.450]  Some of it was Black Pigeon Speaks, not against TOS, not even really out there.
[03:39:31.450 --> 03:39:33.232]  I think one of the videos is kind of out there.
[03:39:33.232 --> 03:39:34.693]  The other two, not really.
[03:39:34.693 --> 03:39:36.134]  They were pretty mundane.
[03:39:36.134 --> 03:39:39.477]  Swan of 2Alena, I believe, and others.
[03:39:39.477 --> 03:39:43.861]  And when the content gets censored like that, somebody slaps it on a list somewhere.
[03:39:44.557 --> 03:39:48.158]  And other people think, wow, well it must be cool because it's been put in a limited state.
[03:39:48.158 --> 03:39:53.720]  The Streisand effect kicks in, all of a sudden a hundred times more people are watching it.
[03:39:53.720 --> 03:40:00.922]  They just, they simply can't interact with it on YouTube, and that's, I think it's YouTube's plausible deniability at play there.
[03:40:00.922 --> 03:40:07.524]  Where they, they don't really care per se if the material is there, but they're trying to appease those same leftists, and so they're like, oh,
[03:40:07.964 --> 03:40:11.049]  Well, yeah, it'll spread around far further.
[03:40:11.049 --> 03:40:15.635]  We don't really care, though, because all these NGOs that we're working with, they'll be appeased.
[03:40:15.635 --> 03:40:18.339]  People will just spread it around off of Google services.
[03:40:18.339 --> 03:40:19.441]  So it's all good, I guess.
[03:40:21.030 --> 03:40:30.232]  Yeah, it was interesting because I think one of those videos, and I didn't watch it all, but it was basically a woman in her living room from Finland or somewhere talking about the migrant crisis.
[03:40:30.232 --> 03:40:35.373]  That was one of them that was limited to say, this is like, oh, this is the most shocking, controversial thing.
[03:40:35.373 --> 03:40:38.733]  Literally some woman sat in front of a webcam talking about things.
[03:40:38.733 --> 03:40:45.574]  But like you said, you know, it gives them that Streisand effect, it makes it illicit, it gives it this illicit cachet.
[03:40:45.574 --> 03:40:48.915]  I thought they would deal with that by just banning a whole range of things, but
[03:40:49.496 --> 03:40:57.037]  Right, as of this moment, it seems to be quite limited, the actual number of videos that they've censored in that way, so, you know, maybe it's just a token measure.
[03:40:58.351 --> 03:41:01.773]  Yeah, I wanted to move on though because, you know, we're short on time.
[03:41:01.773 --> 03:41:15.440]  The whole moral panic over white supremacism, fascism, we had Calgary Police, I saw you talking about this the other day, they put out a list of potential characteristics for parents whose children might be prone to joining racist hate groups.
[03:41:15.440 --> 03:41:22.063]  One of them was literally listening to heavy metal music and you made the connection, the comparison,
[03:41:22.683 --> 03:41:32.228]  How it's completely flipped, like back in the day it was the evangelicals, it was the Christian right that created this whole panic over, you know, satanic messages embedded in rock music.
[03:41:32.228 --> 03:41:36.430]  So it seems to have completely flipped where the so-called progressives are now the Puritans, right?
[03:41:37.748 --> 03:41:38.369]  Exactly.
[03:41:38.369 --> 03:41:44.053]  I expect them to start burning albums, or something like that, or literally burning books.
[03:41:44.053 --> 03:41:58.424]  Like, you know, ten years ago we're talking about good, pious, generally right-leaning at least, Christian individuals are like, Harry Potter doesn't belong in the library, Harry Potter doesn't belong, you know, Lord of the Rings or something doesn't belong in the school.
[03:41:58.424 --> 03:41:59.065]  Why is it there?
[03:41:59.065 --> 03:42:00.205]  It's offensive to us.
[03:42:00.205 --> 03:42:02.107]  So we must suppress it because it's offensive.
[03:42:02.427 --> 03:42:06.372]  It's the same thing that they're saying now, it's just different people saying it.
[03:42:06.372 --> 03:42:15.082]  But I think part of it is, uh, those, some millennials, not all, like I'm a millennial myself, but some, or I should say many,
[03:42:15.982 --> 03:42:26.251]  They've done what the people who stood against the reigning culture in maybe the 80s did, which is they got older, they got more boring, and now they're moralistic.
[03:42:26.251 --> 03:42:29.154]  But they've been imprinted on differently from past generations.
[03:42:29.154 --> 03:42:32.877]  Back then it was, you listen to Iron Maiden and Ozzy, you must be a Satanist.
[03:42:32.877 --> 03:42:34.298]  You must be worshipping the devil.
[03:42:34.298 --> 03:42:36.040]  We gotta look out about you.
[03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:38.322]  Probably put you through therapy.
[03:42:38.322 --> 03:42:42.826]  Certainly shouldn't let you speak freely because it's so offensive and it'll cause crime and all these things.
[03:42:43.386 --> 03:42:44.647]  Now they say the same thing.
[03:42:44.647 --> 03:42:50.429]  The Calgary police, as you pointed out, they come out and they say, loud angry rock music makes you a Nazi.
[03:42:50.429 --> 03:42:57.491]  So, if they're listening to literal anarcho-punk, something that communists would listen to, that also makes them a Nazi.
[03:42:58.303 --> 03:43:07.252]  And I think the average person, if they saw it phrased differently, if they're getting this report from the old guard legacy media, they might just gobble it down.
[03:43:07.252 --> 03:43:15.901]  But if they hear somebody online, and this is I think what they're worried about, satirizing the fact that it's so dumb, then they say, oh yeah, of course it's dumb.
[03:43:15.901 --> 03:43:16.882]  That doesn't make any sense.
[03:43:16.882 --> 03:43:20.386]  You know, they were listening to like Iron Butterfly or something like that.
[03:43:22.173 --> 03:43:26.656]  And it all comes back to, again, identity politics, this moral hysteria.
[03:43:26.656 --> 03:43:30.158]  Salon.com had a headline a couple of days ago.
[03:43:30.158 --> 03:43:32.339]  Time to give up on identity politics.
[03:43:32.339 --> 03:43:34.941]  It's dragging the progressive agenda down.
[03:43:34.941 --> 03:43:41.625]  MSNBC this morning was talking about how the identity politics thing just doesn't work electorally for Democrats.
[03:43:41.625 --> 03:43:43.306]  Why are they still doubling down on it?
[03:43:43.866 --> 03:43:56.891]  But of course the top comment call on this salon.com article was somebody whinging about how the writer of this article saying identity politics no longer works for the left is just expressing their white privilege.
[03:43:56.891 --> 03:44:02.173]  So I don't, I mean I see a few chinks of light where they're like actually no what we're doing here this is not working.
[03:44:02.173 --> 03:44:05.734]  But I don't see the left giving up on identity politics yet.
[03:44:05.734 --> 03:44:08.875]  It's such an enraged enthused cult right now.
[03:44:09.435 --> 03:44:18.861]  The, you know, we had the mainstream media, some top celebrities come out and even endorse Antifa after the whole Charlottesville thing.
[03:44:18.861 --> 03:44:21.043]  So they only seem to be doubling down on it.
[03:44:21.043 --> 03:44:38.995]  My point I've made is, and this was a point made by the University of Tennessee professor Glenn Holland Reynolds, he said that this rampant craziness, this hysteria that's being ginned up by the establishment media, which results in, you know, Antifa assaults, results in riots, such as the riots after Trump was elected,
[03:44:39.733 --> 03:44:45.477]  That is going to cause ordinary voters, ordinary Americans, to clamor for right-wing authoritarianism.
[03:44:45.477 --> 03:45:00.767]  So the actual panic that they're engaged in about, oh my god, literally a fascist has taken over the White House, which is of course complete bunkum, they could actually, ironically, bring that real scenario about right-wing authoritarianism by their very actions.
[03:45:00.767 --> 03:45:09.453]  Do you see something like that playing out, or do you think it's kind of going to simmer down as we get further away from the whole riot and the Charlottesville thing?
[03:45:10.270 --> 03:45:14.072]  Well, I hope that it simmers down, but that wouldn't be historically the case.
[03:45:14.072 --> 03:45:18.455]  Usually what happens, we see this in the wake of the Red Scare, the Satanic Panic.
[03:45:18.999 --> 03:45:27.361]  Every time before, the only reason it simmers down is because whatever group was empowered to be abusive falls by the wayside.
[03:45:27.361 --> 03:45:28.741]  They become outdated.
[03:45:28.741 --> 03:45:33.022]  Youth rebellion usually boils over, destroys them.
[03:45:33.022 --> 03:45:40.884]  And then after 10, 15 relatively calm years, the next generation as it grows older does the same thing.
[03:45:40.884 --> 03:45:43.585]  It seems to be an innate human characteristic.
[03:45:43.585 --> 03:45:47.986]  My hope is that at the very least we can safeguard... This is the big thing about alt-tech.
[03:45:48.712 --> 03:46:01.722]  If we just safeguard the Internet as a place to express yourself, so people aren't being harassed, abused, attacked, deplatformed, whatever, for voicing simple opinions, then it doesn't matter if we're in a moral panic.
[03:46:01.722 --> 03:46:11.790]  At the very least, people will always be able to speak freely, and if they can speak freely, good ideas, non-abusive ideas, hopefully, tend to win out over time.
[03:46:11.790 --> 03:46:17.114]  If we allow overt censorship of the main mode of human communication, which is the Internet now,
[03:46:17.794 --> 03:46:25.258]  If we allow it to become too heavily censored, and all tech is suppressed, then we probably fall into another Dark Ages.
[03:46:25.258 --> 03:46:30.480]  It would hold back all of human development on just an economic level, not even just a cultural level.
[03:46:30.480 --> 03:46:32.641]  It'd be terrible, I think, for this entire world.
[03:46:34.460 --> 03:46:41.085]  And of course, the argument that I've heard many times, and I've made the argument, you know, why don't you just build your own video platform?
[03:46:41.085 --> 03:46:43.566]  Why don't you just build your own social media platform?
[03:46:43.566 --> 03:46:50.831]  The argument before was, it's pointless, it will just be an echo chamber, you won't be reaching the masses, you'll be preaching to the choir.
[03:46:50.831 --> 03:47:01.879]  That seems to have shifted a little bit, especially, you know, BitChute came out with a, I think it was a tweet, where they showed their traffic going through the roof after I just gave them a few tweets, you did as well, a couple of other prominent people.
[03:47:03.032 --> 03:47:08.793]  You said, I saw a video where you were saying Gab wasn't an echo chain, but that's the main criticism that they get.
[03:47:09.753 --> 03:47:11.215]  Question is, is it worth it?
[03:47:11.215 --> 03:47:17.221]  Should we just stick to the big dominant forums or should we actually start moving our content over?
[03:47:17.221 --> 03:47:22.306]  At least giving, you know, BitChute the exclusive first upload on the video, things like that.
[03:47:22.306 --> 03:47:32.957]  Do you think that is worth it or is that just a backup measure and we should continue with these main big platforms like YouTube as our primary content generators?
[03:47:34.105 --> 03:47:39.450]  I think the best strategy is we stand and fight on the big sites as much as possible.
[03:47:39.450 --> 03:47:40.831]  Hopefully things get better.
[03:47:40.831 --> 03:47:43.574]  Hopefully the long-term human trend is bucked.
[03:47:43.574 --> 03:47:44.675]  No more problem.
[03:47:44.675 --> 03:47:47.017]  Alt Media is still there.
[03:47:47.017 --> 03:47:48.639]  That will have its own audience.
[03:47:49.258 --> 03:47:58.080]  But like I've been putting my content on VidMe, I do exclusives there, I put it on BitChute, I'm on Mines, I'm on Gab, I'm on Twitter, I'm on everywhere basically.
[03:47:58.080 --> 03:48:11.024]  I've got two blogs for just my books because I could no longer just rely on BlogSpot because I said well some people are being, if you look at Jordan Peterson, he gets kicked off even Gmail for something posted on YouTube.
[03:48:11.024 --> 03:48:13.124]  So how am I supposed to trust BlogSpot?
[03:48:13.124 --> 03:48:16.145]  It has nothing to do with my political discourse, it's just where I sell books.
[03:48:17.114 --> 03:48:22.516]  But we should definitely try to maintain sites that have already been built.
[03:48:22.516 --> 03:48:30.579]  I'm not saying we should flee anything, because that's just the worst possible decision to make, because then that turns into an echo chamber, too.
[03:48:30.579 --> 03:48:33.220]  It'd be used for attacks on all media.
[03:48:33.220 --> 03:48:34.120]  It would be freakish.
[03:48:34.807 --> 03:48:37.788]  But these new sites that are cropping up, they are growing.
[03:48:37.788 --> 03:48:39.509]  They're already not echo chambers.
[03:48:39.509 --> 03:48:42.130]  They're already entertaining, so why not use them?
[03:48:42.130 --> 03:48:45.131]  As far as a site like Facebook, it's already not entertaining.
[03:48:45.131 --> 03:48:46.551]  Facebook is worthless now.
[03:48:46.551 --> 03:48:48.212]  YouTube's entertaining.
[03:48:48.212 --> 03:48:49.493]  Twitter can be entertaining.
[03:48:49.493 --> 03:48:52.474]  Facebook's the odd man out.
[03:48:52.474 --> 03:48:54.194]  Why even bother using it?
[03:48:54.194 --> 03:48:58.776]  I wouldn't even use it at all if there weren't a couple of people I know in real life that I even talk to there.
[03:49:00.859 --> 03:49:04.382]  Now I just want to get your take quickly on this new announcement today.
[03:49:04.382 --> 03:49:05.483]  Verit!
[03:49:05.483 --> 03:49:08.526]  This is the big Hillary Clinton backed new platform.
[03:49:08.526 --> 03:49:12.430]  Media for the 65.8 million, I tweeted.
[03:49:12.430 --> 03:49:15.693]  Media for everyone who has the same opinion about everything.
[03:49:15.693 --> 03:49:17.074]  I went on this site.
[03:49:17.074 --> 03:49:18.876]  It's confusing and bizarre.
[03:49:18.876 --> 03:49:21.678]  It seems like it's not, you know, aesthetically pleasing.
[03:49:21.678 --> 03:49:23.300]  What is the point of this?
[03:49:23.300 --> 03:49:24.441]  It's very strange.
[03:49:25.811 --> 03:49:26.752]  It's Greek to me.
[03:49:26.752 --> 03:49:32.835]  I guess it's to take vetted information, put it in vaguely meme-like form, and spit it out.
[03:49:32.835 --> 03:49:33.695]  But I was on there.
[03:49:33.695 --> 03:49:38.718]  They already had one bad-mouthing Bernie Sanders, and they choose just the wrong day to do this.
[03:49:38.718 --> 03:49:40.039]  This is why I think their site's doomed.
[03:49:40.629 --> 03:49:44.830]  On the same exact day, we get that quip from Hillary Clinton's own book.
[03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:48.472]  Oh yeah, basically Bernie Sanders cost me the election.
[03:49:48.472 --> 03:49:49.952]  He hobbled me permanently.
[03:49:49.952 --> 03:49:51.733]  He's such a terrible person.
[03:49:51.733 --> 03:49:53.373]  I'm proud to be a Democrat.
[03:49:53.373 --> 03:49:55.734]  I wish that Bernie was, is the exact line from there.
[03:49:56.229 --> 03:50:01.115]  How moronic can her strategy possibly be to think that that's a good idea?
[03:50:01.115 --> 03:50:10.426]  She's trying to ingratiate herself to the same, you know, neoliberals, the pro-war, you know, not really fiscally far-left types that are just social authoritarians.
[03:50:11.084 --> 03:50:15.827]  They're trying to maintain power and all they can do, they don't even want to attack Trump half the time.
[03:50:15.827 --> 03:50:19.649]  They'd rather attack Bernie Sanders as long as Hillary Clinton wants to do it.
[03:50:19.649 --> 03:50:22.871]  So I think she's probably going to take advantage of this site.
[03:50:22.871 --> 03:50:30.935]  A lot of people will be alienated and it'll just, it'll end up not even just a left-wing echo chamber, but specifically a pro-Clinton echo chamber.
[03:50:30.935 --> 03:50:35.317]  And people will, they'll slowly gravitate out as they realize Clinton's not going to run again.
[03:50:35.317 --> 03:50:36.338]  I don't think she will.
[03:50:37.913 --> 03:50:43.315]  All right, we're going to come back in the final segment with Karl Warwick to talk about his YouTube channel.
[03:50:43.315 --> 03:50:44.256]  Oh, we're skipping the break?
[03:50:44.256 --> 03:50:45.356]  OK, that's great.
[03:50:45.356 --> 03:50:54.920]  Karl, just with the final outro here, I wanted to ask you about your kind of approach to this, because you seem to make so many videos about so many different topics.
[03:50:55.320 --> 03:50:57.922]  You seem to have such an extensive knowledge about everything.
[03:50:57.922 --> 03:50:59.504]  It's damn annoying, actually.
[03:50:59.504 --> 03:51:03.927]  But I just wanted to get a sense of, you know, how do you approach different topics?
[03:51:03.927 --> 03:51:05.708]  Do you do a massive amount of reading?
[03:51:05.708 --> 03:51:08.791]  I mean, what are your sources for information, essentially?
[03:51:11.497 --> 03:51:17.479]  Essentially, what I try to do, I try to keep up to date on everything that's happening in the world to the best of my ability.
[03:51:17.479 --> 03:51:19.940]  And there are some fairly good sites.
[03:51:19.940 --> 03:51:23.962]  It's sort of hit or miss, because you can't rely upon the old guard.
[03:51:23.962 --> 03:51:26.243]  You can't go to CNN or Fox or anything like that.
[03:51:26.243 --> 03:51:27.723]  I don't watch TV.
[03:51:27.723 --> 03:51:32.025]  You can use their websites as a springboard, I guess, but why would you even want to give them views?
[03:51:32.025 --> 03:51:33.826]  I'll archive it if I share the links now.
[03:51:34.386 --> 03:51:46.888]  I prefer using 4chan, honestly, above anything else as a news aggregator at this point, because it's simply, again, it's not the echo chamber some people believe that it is, and so you're getting all sorts of stuff.
[03:51:46.888 --> 03:51:52.249]  You can get local news an hour before it's broken by the lamestream sort of press.
[03:51:52.249 --> 03:51:54.709]  So I try to keep up to date on all of that.
[03:51:54.709 --> 03:52:00.530]  I like to read a lot when I can, when I have time, and I just have a lot of interests, basically.
[03:52:00.530 --> 03:52:03.631]  That's basically what it's about, and I'm pledged.
[03:52:04.269 --> 03:52:10.454]  To trying, insofar as I'm able to, to break the stranglehold of the legacy media.
[03:52:10.454 --> 03:52:13.756]  Because they've lied to me since I was a little kid.
[03:52:13.756 --> 03:52:15.757]  They lied to me with Iraq.
[03:52:15.757 --> 03:52:17.879]  They lied to me with Afghanistan.
[03:52:17.879 --> 03:52:23.103]  They personally lied to me about basically everything I used to think was reality.
[03:52:23.103 --> 03:52:24.884]  And that honestly makes me mad.
[03:52:24.884 --> 03:52:26.265]  I don't think that I'm alone in that.
[03:52:28.044 --> 03:52:31.647]  No, I mean, there's huge resentment now against the likes of CNN.
[03:52:31.647 --> 03:52:37.512]  Their reporters express bewilderment whenever there's a negative chant about them, whenever they go out in public.
[03:52:37.512 --> 03:52:42.417]  But Twitter, it seems you don't get involved in the Twitter spats, which is something that I do.
[03:52:42.417 --> 03:52:46.400]  It's a massive vacuum that sucks up all your time, obviously.
[03:52:46.400 --> 03:52:55.568]  But from what I've seen, you don't tend to get too deeply involved in the back and forth on Twitter, I guess, because you know it's kind of a small platform, really, in the aggregate, isn't it?
[03:52:56.812 --> 03:53:01.100]  Yeah, well, Twitter was something that I never even planned on joining.
[03:53:01.100 --> 03:53:06.731]  I had originally said, I'll never have a Twitter, I'll never use any of these other sites, I was just a YouTuber.
[03:53:07.438 --> 03:53:14.642]  And then the far left decided, hey, we want more censorship, we want to marginalize people, manipulate all the algorithms.
[03:53:14.642 --> 03:53:17.544]  So I'm like, well, nobody's getting notifications.
[03:53:17.544 --> 03:53:18.964]  I need a Twitter account.
[03:53:18.964 --> 03:53:23.187]  But I try to avoid direct sort of confrontational stuff.
[03:53:23.187 --> 03:53:25.768]  I'd rather just make my own views known, put them out there.
[03:53:25.768 --> 03:53:28.289]  If somebody disagrees, that's okay.
[03:53:28.289 --> 03:53:29.330]  If they want to attack me,
[03:53:29.850 --> 03:53:30.911]  That's okay, too.
[03:53:30.911 --> 03:53:32.452]  I support their free speech, too.
[03:53:32.452 --> 03:53:35.053]  I don't care if they're a self-proclaimed communist.
[03:53:35.053 --> 03:53:36.134]  They can come aboard.
[03:53:36.134 --> 03:53:39.376]  They're never going to get banned on my channel just for insulting me.
[03:53:39.376 --> 03:53:48.161]  They would have to go after one of my other subscribers or post something that's blatantly illegal in order to get banned from the channel.
[03:53:48.161 --> 03:53:54.105]  All right, Carl, just in the final minute here, tell people how they can find you on Twitter and YouTube.
[03:53:54.105 --> 03:53:58.587]  I guess if you just type in sticks, it kind of pops up automatically, right?
[03:53:58.587 --> 03:53:59.388]  On YouTube, at least.
[03:54:00.177 --> 03:54:10.687]  Yes, you can search for that or sticksexandhammer666 on YouTube or stick666official on Twitter or on Gab, actually.
[03:54:10.687 --> 03:54:13.850]  Definitely go check out Carl's videos, really insightful stuff.
[03:54:13.850 --> 03:54:15.752]  Carl, we'll have you back on the show soon.
[03:54:15.752 --> 03:54:17.594]  Thanks for joining us today.
[03:54:17.594 --> 03:54:18.415]  Thank you for having me.
[03:54:19.540 --> 03:54:20.180]  OK, thank you.
[03:54:20.180 --> 03:54:22.682]  There goes Carl Warwick.
[03:54:22.682 --> 03:54:25.043]  Sticks, hex and hammer 666.
[03:54:25.043 --> 03:54:26.484]  That's S-T-Y-X.
[03:54:26.484 --> 03:54:28.745]  If you search for that on YouTube, it will pop up.
[03:54:28.745 --> 03:54:33.628]  Again, amazing insight, amazing commentary on a whole manner of different subjects.
[03:54:33.628 --> 03:54:37.309]  Let's dip back into the news in these few final minutes, though.
[03:54:37.309 --> 03:54:39.110]  I mentioned this earlier.
[03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:41.031]  Former Bush official.
[03:54:41.031 --> 03:54:43.733]  All Trump supporters are racist.
[03:54:44.525 --> 03:54:53.851]  Former George W. Bush Treasury official Bruce Bartlett has claimed that all, 100%, he was very specific, of Trump supporters are racist.
[03:54:53.851 --> 03:55:02.576]  Now this was a Treasury official, as I said, under the George W. Bush administration, also a domestic policy advisor to Ronald Reagan.
[03:55:02.576 --> 03:55:06.258]  He posted this message on his Facebook page yesterday.
[03:55:06.258 --> 03:55:09.940]  There is no longer any doubt all 100% of Trump supporters are racist.
[03:55:09.940 --> 03:55:11.301]  If you don't like it, F you!
[03:55:12.299 --> 03:55:18.324]  And then he was absolutely amazed that he had people disagreeing with him.
[03:55:18.324 --> 03:55:21.447]  He basically had a hysterical tantrum and a meltdown.
[03:55:22.159 --> 03:55:27.822]  And went on to basically be really triggered about the fact that people don't like being called racist.
[03:55:27.822 --> 03:55:35.386]  Definitely not 63 million people, but he was still surprised that there was an actual backlash on that.
[03:55:35.386 --> 03:55:49.374]  Of course, he was mimicking almost exactly Hillary Clinton's infamous basket of deplorables quote said before the election, a couple of months before the election, where she basically said half of Trump supporters were Islamophobe, racist, sexist, you remember it.
[03:55:49.978 --> 03:55:52.060]  Again, this is a never-Trumper guy.
[03:55:52.060 --> 03:55:59.225]  He gets up on Facebook, calls 63 million people racist, and then claims that he's the victim.
[03:55:59.225 --> 03:56:00.246]  Boo-hoo!
[03:56:00.246 --> 03:56:02.808]  Because people were mean to him!
[03:56:02.808 --> 03:56:06.031]  This is like a 60-year-old guy.
[03:56:06.031 --> 03:56:07.572]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:56:07.572 --> 03:56:09.153]  He tried to walk it back.
[03:56:09.153 --> 03:56:09.754]  Listen to this.
[03:56:10.646 --> 03:56:16.010]  I did not say all Trump voters are racist, nor did I even imply that all Republicans are racist.
[03:56:16.010 --> 03:56:18.733]  What I said is that all Trump supporters are racist.
[03:56:18.733 --> 03:56:25.578]  That means the people who support Trump now, today, after all this horrible racist statements and actions, those people are racist.
[03:56:25.578 --> 03:56:31.623]  Of course, I completely failed to name a single one of those quote racist statements and actions, but
[03:56:32.506 --> 03:56:34.046]  Everyone who supports Trump is a racist.
[03:56:34.046 --> 03:56:35.567]  This is literally what they've got.
[03:56:35.567 --> 03:56:44.389]  We're here in September 2017 and everyone who disagrees with me as a racist is still all they've got.
[03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:50.491]  They were up on MSNBC, Joe Scarborough today, on the panel admitting that it's not working.
[03:56:51.241 --> 03:56:58.888]  Even Bernie Sanders came out, probably six months ago, probably more than that, saying, look guys, this is just not working.
[03:56:58.888 --> 03:57:01.571]  Calling people racist isn't an argument.
[03:57:01.571 --> 03:57:12.661]  It doesn't resonate with people who want to hear actual, cogent, logical, thought-out policy debates, and stuff that connects with them as ordinary working people doesn't work.
[03:57:13.536 --> 03:57:15.077]  Didn't work in 2016.
[03:57:15.077 --> 03:57:16.477]  That's why Trump won.
[03:57:16.477 --> 03:57:22.440]  Partly because people were sick to the back teeth of having it rammed down their throats.
[03:57:22.440 --> 03:57:26.501]  Now we've got Salon.com coming out and saying time to give up on identity politics.
[03:57:26.501 --> 03:57:31.323]  Of course they got completely rinsed in the comments by their own readers.
[03:57:31.323 --> 03:57:36.205]  The very top comment was somebody who was saying anyone who claims identity politics
[03:57:36.841 --> 03:57:39.464]  It's a losing argument, which it is electorally.
[03:57:39.464 --> 03:57:42.167]  They're just expressing their white privilege.
[03:57:42.167 --> 03:57:45.310]  That was literally the top comment, upvoted by 200 people.
[03:57:46.937 --> 03:58:03.004]  That's what the readership thinks, that's what the vast majority of the alt-left thinks, and they're going to continue to double down on this losing approach, this losing narrative that anyone who disagrees with them is a white supremacist, is a neo-Nazi, is a racist, fill in the blank.
[03:58:03.004 --> 03:58:14.108]  And even with the media's contrived moral panic over all this white supremacism stuff, it's still not resonating according to what the polls say with the American people.
[03:58:14.108 --> 03:58:15.789]  So good luck, carry on,
[03:58:16.639 --> 03:58:22.366]  Carry on with your obsessive identity politics crap that doesn't resonate with anyone and we'll carry on winning.
[03:58:22.366 --> 03:58:23.988]  That's gonna wrap it up for the show.
[03:58:23.988 --> 03:58:26.151]  Breaking new to InfoWars.com.
[03:58:26.151 --> 03:58:30.616]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:58:30.616 --> 03:58:34.581]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
