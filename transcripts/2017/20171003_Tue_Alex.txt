[00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:21.680]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:53.444]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, on this Tuesday, October 3rd, 2017 global transmission.
[00:00:54.446 --> 00:00:59.453]  Absolute total war has been declared against the Second Amendment.
[00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:08.937]  The Democratic Party and their mouthpieces like Jimmy Kimmel and others are calling for the total abolition of citizens owning firearms.
[00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:12.279]  And Keith Uberman is calling gun owners terrorists.
[00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:19.263]  He says the NRA is a terrorist organization and by extension all gun owners are to blame for this attack.
[00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:30.651]  Even though they don't even really report on the daily Islamic attacks in the US, Canada, Europe, with people screaming Allah Akbar, then it's never Islam's fault.
[00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:35.855]  Here's what we know, and we're going to have breaking news coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:46.123]  All the evidence points towards Islamic connections, and we have ISIS, even the Associated Press admits, that generally only takes credit for things they've actually done.
[00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:57.831]  And they are taking credit and talking about his Islamic name and all the things that he was involved in, the things that the supposed shooter was doing.
[00:01:59.113 --> 00:02:00.956]  That said, he had a lot of investments.
[00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:04.302]  His girlfriend of many years was traveling back and forth the Middle East.
[00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:13.304]  We know that the Islamists will a lot of times give people a lot of money if they promise to then carry out an attack down the road.
[00:02:13.624 --> 00:02:29.114]  And the big question, and I've been talking to a lot of intelligence operatives and really smart people, and they concur with my research and the fact that we're pointing towards the fact that he was paying his gambling debts, getting some type of Islamic funding.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.282]  And then again, in the last two months, he'd openly converted to Islam.
[00:02:33.602 --> 00:02:40.267]  He was known by police in the area and our sources in the hostage rescue team.
[00:02:41.187 --> 00:02:51.835]  And this comes from sources directly inside the hostage rescue team, not the team that went in to assist police, but folks that work with those very people.
[00:02:53.007 --> 00:03:13.682]  That there was some firing going on and some confusion and they believe that they actually killed him and that once inside there was just Antifa literature and garbage piled up basically and that also connections to the Middle East and literature and information.
[00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:19.766]  We know the left is wedded to Islam and using them as their enforcers.
[00:03:21.328 --> 00:03:28.475]  So this is just incredible to have the media coming out yesterday and saying ISIS takes responsibility.
[00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:30.517]  And here's his Islamic name.
[00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:35.062]  And they said they were in contact with him for a long time and he converted two months ago.
[00:03:35.662 --> 00:03:37.284]  And his girlfriend's going to Dubai.
[00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:39.046]  And all the rest of this stuff.
[00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:41.048]  And he's got all this investment money now, we learned.
[00:03:41.308 --> 00:03:45.252]  Millions of dollars coming in from weird sources, not just hundreds of thousands a year.
[00:03:47.574 --> 00:03:50.915]  And he's connected in with the Skunk Works and Lockheed Martin.
[00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:53.556]  This whole thing has a lot of questions.
[00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:59.779]  And so I questioned this yesterday and said, look, ISIS claims Vegas shooting responsibility.
[00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:03.040]  Says Steven Paddock converted to Islam.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.962]  Now, hours later, Newsweek came out with this headline.
[00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:14.404]  This was picked up in publications across the country, corporate fake news, that I made up
[00:04:16.653 --> 00:04:28.182]  That I made up the entire ISIS claiming responsibility, even though it was in thousands of publications, and that my reporting on it was made up.
[00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:32.405]  And they mix in a bunch of stuff I didn't say out of context.
[00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:36.718]  And then, I'm sitting across the breakfast table from my wife this morning.
[00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:42.701]  She's reading the New York Times, saying myself and others put out fake news saying ISIS took responsibility.
[00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:48.543]  So they want to cover up ISIS taking responsibility to the point they're now saying it never happened.
[00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:51.504]  You talk about fake news, they are desperate.
[00:04:51.784 --> 00:04:56.066]  Just like San Bernardino, day one we said it was Islamic, took three days for it to come out.
[00:04:56.346 --> 00:05:01.728]  They are fighting to cover this up, and Trump isn't in control of the Justice Department or the FBI, and they're covering it up.
[00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:08.428]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:15.893]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:05:16.514 --> 00:05:24.899]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:29.162]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:34.906]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:38.968]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:42.590]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:53.877]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.598]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:05:56.838 --> 00:06:02.822]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:06:07.665 --> 00:06:11.687]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:18.270]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:25.774 --> 00:06:34.018]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:40.693]  Here's what we know on this October 3rd, 2017, Tuesday, worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:56.991]  The left, from Phil Mudd, deputy director of the CIA, to the former director of the CIA, Brennan, to Al Gore, to... all of them, basically, have gone on
[00:06:58.453 --> 00:07:06.956]  National television and said Trump will soon be removed and that there's going to be a violent revolution in America slash Arab Spring.
[00:07:09.117 --> 00:07:22.763]  Now Newsweek has tried to deceive the public putting out an article attacking me titled Alex Jones says the deep state is behind the Las Vegas attack and then they come out and say Jones made it up
[00:07:24.025 --> 00:07:30.409]  Claiming that ISIS had taken responsibility and they say that ISIS never took responsibility.
[00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:33.150]  This is the next level lies.
[00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:47.058]  Hours before Newsweek itself ran the headline, we can put that on screen, that ISIS took responsibility and they released the Islamic name that he went under.
[00:07:48.058 --> 00:07:49.039]  Now, think about that.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.281]  And it's in the New York Times today.
[00:07:53.254 --> 00:07:54.434]  And it's in the Washington Post.
[00:07:54.554 --> 00:07:55.175]  It's everywhere.
[00:07:57.215 --> 00:08:01.717]  Reporting that fake news made it up.
[00:08:01.797 --> 00:08:04.518]  They're not even saying ISIS ever said it.
[00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:05.778]  They're saying fake news made it up.
[00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:05.978]  No.
[00:08:06.338 --> 00:08:09.659]  The official ISIS encrypted website put it out.
[00:08:09.899 --> 00:08:11.100]  The FBI reported it.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.320]  That is confirmed.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.142]  So they now are engaged in such incredible fake news and awesome level deception.
[00:08:20.472 --> 00:08:26.197]  That they're just moving on and not saying, well, we question ISIS taking responsibility, because that gives you motive.
[00:08:26.397 --> 00:08:27.918]  You've got his girlfriend going to the Middle East.
[00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:30.460]  You've got him deep in debt, but getting millions of dollars.
[00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:32.162]  Nobody knows where the money came from.
[00:08:34.283 --> 00:08:41.189]  That's what ISIS and Al-Qaeda and folks do, is they pay people to carry out shooting attacks, stabbing attacks, and bombing attacks.
[00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:42.530]  Your family doesn't have money.
[00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.911]  You're in Palestine, Israel.
[00:08:44.572 --> 00:08:46.774]  They'll give you $200,000 and go stab some people.
[00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:50.006]  To go shoot some people, they'll pay even more.
[00:08:50.286 --> 00:08:54.407]  If a suicide bombing ends up killing a hundred people, they might give you a million dollars.
[00:08:56.828 --> 00:09:03.490]  That's how Hamas, that's how Hezbollah, that's how the PLO, that's how all these groups finance the terrorists.
[00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.390]  That's what they do.
[00:09:06.051 --> 00:09:08.331]  And so the media keeps saying, we don't know a motive.
[00:09:08.651 --> 00:09:09.752]  We have no idea.
[00:09:09.772 --> 00:09:13.053]  We have just no inkling
[00:09:14.477 --> 00:09:20.480]  In our minds, of why this happened, or why any of this is going on, zero.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.521]  Absolute, total, zero.
[00:09:26.803 --> 00:09:30.824]  Here's NBC News, Las Vegas shooting, ISIS claim of responsibility.
[00:09:32.165 --> 00:09:36.387]  And it goes on to say, Abu Abed Al-Bahr.
[00:09:37.147 --> 00:09:40.889]  There's his supposed name, Abu Abed Al-Bahr.
[00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:49.034]  Now, first they said, okay, ISIS, even the Associated Press said, normally, when ISIS takes responsibility, it's real.
[00:09:53.236 --> 00:10:01.839]  Then they started spinning it into, oh, it's a sign of desperation by ISIS to claim responsibility.
[00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:03.740]  That was by about three o'clock.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.802]  And by four o'clock Central Time yesterday,
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:21.842]  There was a new headline out that I had completely and totally made the whole thing up with no proof.
[00:10:21.962 --> 00:10:26.664]  So, that's the evolution of their deceptions, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:28.164 --> 00:10:29.824]  Meanwhile, there's new articles breaking today.
[00:10:29.864 --> 00:10:36.986]  Daily Mail, ISIS releases new video bragging that Las Vegas shooting is revenge for US attack against their caliphate.
[00:10:38.607 --> 00:10:39.447]  Now, here's the issue.
[00:10:41.064 --> 00:10:50.481]  If the media, if the controlled corporate media wants to question whether ISIS is taking responsibility, whether that's true or not, that's one thing.
[00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:57.396]  But it's another thing to, again, engage in total deception and say that it's made up.
[00:10:57.496 --> 00:10:58.976]  They never took responsibility.
[00:10:59.536 --> 00:11:03.458]  I just showed you, if you're a TV viewer, two different Newsweek articles.
[00:11:04.138 --> 00:11:05.819]  One saying ISIS took responsibility.
[00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:07.440]  We all heard that yesterday morning.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.880]  It was all over every newspaper.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.941]  It was all over every website.
[00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.121]  It was all over talk radio.
[00:11:11.141 --> 00:11:14.563]  It was all over CBS News, NBC News, CNN, all of it.
[00:11:15.003 --> 00:11:23.025]  And then within hours it's not even true they never took responsibility, but they never retract the old articles and never show how it wasn't true.
[00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:27.766]  The way they retract is claiming I made it up.
[00:11:28.926 --> 00:11:29.907]  You understand that deception?
[00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:38.749]  Now the president is already dealing with their last load of lies from a few days before, where he's in San Juan, just landed 20 minutes ago.
[00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:45.095]  We've had food and supplies stacked up to the sky for almost two weeks.
[00:11:45.355 --> 00:11:49.416]  They've been hit by, well, two hurricanes broadside.
[00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:51.117]  Another one grazed them.
[00:11:51.917 --> 00:11:53.458]  They've been loading it up with food.
[00:11:53.938 --> 00:12:04.282]  They've got 10,000 plus containers at just a few of the ports alone, air-conditioned containers, food, medicine, water, generators, everything they need.
[00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:07.450]  And we now know the mayor ordered a stand-down.
[00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:14.012]  We now know the Democrat-run Teamsters, who control 80% of trucking, blocked it and have gone on TV and admit it.
[00:12:14.992 --> 00:12:15.352]  Wow!
[00:12:17.393 --> 00:12:20.914]  That is the next level psychological war we're under.
[00:12:21.295 --> 00:12:22.375]  And that's the whole point.
[00:12:23.255 --> 00:12:30.178]  They're on the news, on controlled corporate media, on enemy media, saying that all
[00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:35.636]  Gun owners are to blame for this attack, and putting the guilt on you.
[00:12:36.517 --> 00:12:38.639]  Incredible propaganda, incredible bullying.
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:44.726]  But they are the ones that have been building up for a year, intensely, revolution.
[00:12:45.027 --> 00:12:52.095]  Even if Hillary got in, they were going to have a revolution, and put everybody in their place, and end the free press, and Alex Jones was the example of who had to be shut down.
[00:12:54.369 --> 00:12:56.830]  And now Trump got in, so we've got a beachhead.
[00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.250]  They're panicking, but they're going ahead with their operations.
[00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:03.992]  And they said, starting in October and right through November, we're going to start killing conservatives.
[00:13:04.292 --> 00:13:05.812]  We're going to start killing white people.
[00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:09.093]  Mainly white people saying that and pushing it.
[00:13:09.113 --> 00:13:11.614]  90% of the time.
[00:13:11.634 --> 00:13:16.256]  Because I don't want to report what they're saying and act like it's black folks or Hispanics that are doing it.
[00:13:16.556 --> 00:13:16.836]  It is.
[00:13:17.056 --> 00:13:18.156]  You've seen the videos everywhere.
[00:13:18.376 --> 00:13:18.876]  I've been there.
[00:13:18.896 --> 00:13:20.077]  90% of the time.
[00:13:20.097 --> 00:13:21.577]  In fact, 95% of the time, it's white people.
[00:13:24.824 --> 00:13:31.447]  There weren't any black people or Hispanics or Asians attacking me when I was in Seattle with hot coffee or trying to punch me or spitting at me.
[00:13:31.467 --> 00:13:32.728]  It was all white people.
[00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:42.553]  Because it's a weird, whacked out thing where I guess they used to be racist or something and now they've flipped to the other side so now they hate themselves and hate all white people.
[00:13:42.633 --> 00:13:43.013]  I mean, it's...
[00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:46.522]  Martin Luther King would say, that's a crazy racist right there.
[00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:48.302]  A crazy white racist that hates white people.
[00:13:48.843 --> 00:13:52.104]  So you see him frothing saying, we're coming to kill you.
[00:13:52.544 --> 00:13:54.184]  We're learning how to use weapons.
[00:13:54.644 --> 00:13:55.965]  We're learning how to come after you.
[00:13:56.065 --> 00:14:07.769]  I was on the air Sunday night saying, I've been to major shooting ranges and they tell me the biggest group they've got is liberals preparing for civil war against the American people.
[00:14:09.565 --> 00:14:23.690]  I said that Friday night, 4 to 6 p.m., with Matt Bracken, the Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert on, and we said, I'm surprised there hadn't been a terror attack yet today, other than the two we saw screaming, Allah Akbar, in Canada and in France.
[00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:31.153]  And then hours later, it happened, and Bracken's on air saying, I think they'll shoot into a rock concert or a football game.
[00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:40.414]  And use that attack either on a right-wing patsy or on somebody else to trigger a civil war, and it happened hours later.
[00:14:42.737 --> 00:14:51.287]  If you want to know why they are coming after us, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to know why,
[00:14:54.366 --> 00:14:55.747]  It's because we actually study this.
[00:14:56.127 --> 00:14:57.208]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:14:57.708 --> 00:15:04.013]  And I've got sources, ladies and gentlemen, that they know my sources included the President of the United States.
[00:15:04.943 --> 00:15:10.945]  And they've moved heaven and earth in mainstream news, admitting trying to get General Kelly to block my information from getting to his desk.
[00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:16.627]  I mean, I can pick up the phone and I can call 20 different people at every level of the CIA.
[00:15:17.087 --> 00:15:19.728]  I can pick up the phone and call the FBI, federal marshals.
[00:15:19.768 --> 00:15:22.870]  I can pick up the phone and I can call you name it.
[00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:31.613]  And they all concur with information I'm going to break at the bottom of the hour with a Kit Daniels article that is about to go up.
[00:15:32.711 --> 00:15:54.344]  That shows massive connections in absolutely bolstering and augmenting the argument that this guy was an islamicist or an islamicist patsy being handled and set up to pay off gambling debts that were being paid out of the Middle East for him to carry out this attack or to at least be set up in the attack.
[00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:58.186]  And we're going to break all the exclusive intel coming up here.

[00:19:06.129 --> 00:19:12.154]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:19:12.574 --> 00:19:15.357]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:15.757 --> 00:19:18.760]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.403]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:19:22.743 --> 00:19:23.204]  The left
[00:19:23.544 --> 00:19:24.465]  ...controls culture.
[00:19:24.505 --> 00:19:25.486]  They control art.
[00:19:25.546 --> 00:19:26.767]  They control entertainment.
[00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:34.174]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:36.616]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:19:37.117 --> 00:19:40.981]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:43.082]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:49.085]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:19:49.345 --> 00:19:55.588]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:19:55.668 --> 00:19:57.369]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:19:57.509 --> 00:19:58.689]  It's available right now.
[00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:01.570]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:07.073 --> 00:20:09.694]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:37.466 --> 00:20:38.266]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:43.629]  This is InfoWars Live, coming to you from our television studios, simulcast on radio.
[00:20:44.849 --> 00:20:49.671]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com are our sites.
[00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:56.094]  The sites all have a lot of the same news, but a lot of different video and articles and original content as well.
[00:20:56.914 --> 00:20:58.795]  And NewsWars loads super fast.
[00:20:58.815 --> 00:21:00.036]  It is a very modern site.
[00:21:00.416 --> 00:21:05.218]  We're in the process of redesigning PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:21:06.784 --> 00:21:11.747]  So, here's the information we have right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:19.732]  American gun owners cannot back down in the face of the sustained demonization of the Second Amendment.
[00:21:20.373 --> 00:21:25.416]  And you notice all the mass shootings that still statistically are a very rare way to die.
[00:21:27.199 --> 00:21:39.707]  Cannot get us to give up our guns because we understand if some Islamist runs over a group of people with a car and kills 20-something people, you don't then say, aren't car drivers insensitive for still having their cars?
[00:21:41.608 --> 00:21:44.750]  No, it's a bad person using a tool to do that.
[00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:49.433]  If somebody dumps cyanide in the water supply, the lake isn't bad.
[00:21:50.737 --> 00:21:57.144]  And you're not insensitive if you're watching people in another country dying by the thousands from cyanide poisoning in the water.
[00:21:57.445 --> 00:21:58.987]  You're not bad when you drink water.
[00:22:00.448 --> 00:22:01.610]  The water's not bad.
[00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.352]  Somebody put poison in it.
[00:22:04.253 --> 00:22:05.414]  Guns are tools.
[00:22:05.754 --> 00:22:07.596]  Guns are resources as well.
[00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:16.838]  And everywhere we've seen guns, we've seen crime drop, except for areas like Chicago, New York, D.C., where they restrict the law abiding having the guns.
[00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:19.341]  The crime rates have precipitously exploded there.
[00:22:19.561 --> 00:22:21.122]  And I know our audience knows that.
[00:22:23.565 --> 00:22:31.993]  But within minutes, Hillary did her customary doublespeak on Twitter and said, I don't want to get political and partisan, now's not the time, but the NRA and the Republicans are to blame.
[00:22:35.128 --> 00:22:38.930]  So we've got close to 60 people dead, hundreds and hundreds, over 500 wounded.
[00:22:40.111 --> 00:22:45.274]  But still, more than 100 people die every day on America's highways.
[00:22:45.595 --> 00:22:46.755]  Are we gonna ban cars?
[00:22:47.076 --> 00:22:50.498]  Well, they're trying, saying, hey, let it all be driverless, it'll be safer!
[00:22:51.899 --> 00:22:53.139]  Hell, don't ever be born!
[00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:54.160]  Then you'll never die!
[00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:55.981]  Don't ever rock climb!
[00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:57.142]  Don't play dodgeball!
[00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:58.443]  Don't play contact sports!
[00:22:58.743 --> 00:23:00.064]  That's where this is going!
[00:23:01.164 --> 00:23:03.346]  And you've got Jimmy Kimmel, the dirtbag,
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:30.276]  Who admittedly is the creature, the minion of Chuckie Schumer, meeting with him on the healthcare debacle, on that scam, propping up the scam that's Obamacare, the bipartisan fraud that's Obamacare, and now going after the guns, crying last night with his fake tears, saying, take all the guns, and blaming American gun owners, and blaming the NRA.
[00:23:32.176 --> 00:23:35.157]  Because when they attack the NRA, they mean you, and me, and all of us.
[00:23:36.237 --> 00:23:46.080]  It turns out, there's photos and videos of his armed security everywhere he goes, packing 9mm, 40s, and 10mm on their hips.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:46.940]  That's right.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:53.182]  Under their shirts, he has up to 8 security people when he goes to dinner, or anywhere else.
[00:23:53.902 --> 00:23:55.843]  I'm not going to spend the money I've got for that.
[00:23:55.863 --> 00:23:57.263]  I'm going to spend it to expand this operation.
[00:23:57.283 --> 00:23:59.984]  I'm not going to have 6, 7 security people with me at all times.
[00:24:00.024 --> 00:24:00.784]  I've got to have some now.
[00:24:02.346 --> 00:24:05.111]  But the real security is right here.
[00:24:05.732 --> 00:24:12.626]  So how is it different if I have this Glock and an M4 right here?
[00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:22.644]  To defend myself if somebody comes in here, but then when he has guys off in the shadows with guns, then it's okay, because see, they're the state, or they're the specially licensed people.
[00:24:23.424 --> 00:24:30.046]  Oh, so just when only they have the guns, you end up having tyranny, because they always end up taking over, like any banana republic country.
[00:24:30.066 --> 00:24:32.387]  But I know everybody knows that in this audience.
[00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:36.088]  We've won the information war when it comes down to that.
[00:24:37.406 --> 00:24:45.232]  The left knows it, so they're all going to gun ranges, getting guns, and training to come after us and saying they're going to kill us.
[00:24:45.652 --> 00:24:51.196]  And then we see a country music venue of mainly white people hit.
[00:24:51.817 --> 00:25:04.827]  And then they say, we don't know a motive when ISIS takes responsibility, when the guy's girlfriend's going to the Middle East, when the guy's got all these debts, when the hotel's owned by a big globalist leftist that gives money to cop-killer groups, reportedly, and leftist Antifa groups.
[00:25:06.007 --> 00:25:08.008]  Clearly, there's cameras in every hallway.
[00:25:08.068 --> 00:25:10.549]  You do anything, even halfway suspicious, they come.
[00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:24.897]  One of my own bodyguards was out in Vegas years ago, and the maid went through his underwear drawer, found his firearm, and then tried to claim it wasn't properly serial number registered, but it was through the company he was working for, but they tried to take him to jail.
[00:25:25.577 --> 00:25:30.560]  The point is, they dig through everything in your hotel there in Vegas.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:55.072]  It happens in all major chains, but in Vegas, they go through everything in your pill chest, they go through everything in your toiletries, they go through all your clothes, they go through what you're reading, they thumb through your books to make sure they're not hollow books, they do a security sweep, and they have cameras more in Vegas than anywhere else in a private area, and for five days, this guy supposedly hauled
[00:25:56.823 --> 00:25:57.604]  Get ready for it.
[00:25:57.624 --> 00:26:05.510]  40 plus firearms up into the room and thousands of rounds of ammunition with maids coming in and out.
[00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:09.392]  When they see Do Not Disturb on your door for more than a day, they come in.
[00:26:09.973 --> 00:26:13.095]  When you first get there, they do a suite the minute you leave.
[00:26:13.415 --> 00:26:17.138]  They do that in every major hotel, especially casinos.
[00:26:17.538 --> 00:26:25.865]  You're in a suite for five days lugging 40 firearms in there and nobody knew it was coming.
[00:26:26.801 --> 00:26:28.204]  Nobody knew it was happening.
[00:26:28.685 --> 00:26:35.438]  And of course, they've got every manufactured type you can imagine of semi-auto and of different conversions to be able to ban all of those.
[00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:37.001]  You can see the whole cutout.
[00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.911]  That comes from really smart people and my own research.
[00:26:41.971 --> 00:26:44.832]  So, law enforcement isn't buying any of this.
[00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:46.693]  The military's not buying it.
[00:26:47.013 --> 00:26:48.653]  Security personnel aren't buying it.
[00:26:48.913 --> 00:26:51.374]  The hostage rescue team, the FBI isn't buying it.
[00:26:51.414 --> 00:26:51.894]  Low level.
[00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:56.656]  But high level, the FBI's got people out politically demonizing the Second Amendment.
[00:26:57.056 --> 00:26:59.617]  Active duty, current high level FBI.
[00:26:59.637 --> 00:27:01.838]  Because Trump hasn't culled all those people out.
[00:27:03.338 --> 00:27:06.139]  You've got the Clintons and the Bushes and then Obama.
[00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:17.426]  You've got close to 20 years, ladies and gentlemen, of them being able to put all of the people they want into place in all these positions.
[00:27:17.967 --> 00:27:20.088]  The government's full of reality winners.
[00:27:20.408 --> 00:27:30.396]  The government's full of, you know, this lieutenant from West Point saying the violent communist revolution's coming soon.
[00:27:30.796 --> 00:27:31.417]  So what do they do?
[00:27:32.827 --> 00:27:38.990]  Well, they take out a bunch of Christians, they take out a bunch of conservatives, and then they blame it on the very same group.
[00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:44.653]  And even mainstream media says, CNN, I've got the clip, well this was mainly Trump supporters that got shot.
[00:27:44.953 --> 00:27:45.974]  So I guess they deserve it.
[00:27:46.234 --> 00:27:51.156]  And the deputy head of CBS had to resign yesterday because she said, I don't feel sorry for them.
[00:27:51.456 --> 00:27:56.459]  They deserve it because they're Christians and they're Trump supporters that listen to country music.
[00:27:57.219 --> 00:28:22.384]  Bigoted and hateful and sickening and in your face like you're a moron They said they're coming with a revolution they said they're gonna get violent they said they're gonna go after us But they're gonna do it where they attack us and then blame us for the very attack They've carried out and you know, it's the season they said they were gonna do it they said it was coming October 1st and
[00:28:23.024 --> 00:28:31.854]  And then they give you the biggest massacre in US history using firearms so they can try to counter our revolution to take the country back.
[00:28:32.034 --> 00:28:34.217]  It's ridiculously obvious.
[00:28:34.557 --> 00:28:37.100]  It's sickeningly right out in the open.
[00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:39.062]  It's overwhelming.
[00:28:39.482 --> 00:28:40.983]  ICE is taking responsibility.
[00:28:41.203 --> 00:28:46.886]  The guy's live-in wife, you know, his common-law wife, going to the Middle East.
[00:28:47.307 --> 00:28:50.208]  And he's in all these debts, getting millions of dollars from nowhere.
[00:28:50.629 --> 00:28:52.370]  Unbelievably obvious what went on.
[00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.372]  He either did it or he was set up as the patsy in it.
[00:28:55.412 --> 00:28:59.274]  And then they say we don't have a motive when we've already had them take responsibility.
[00:29:03.342 --> 00:29:05.443]  Before I go any further, we need your financial support.
[00:29:05.583 --> 00:29:14.869]  I want to hire a bunch of people, because I'm all in this year, spending everything on expansion, adding those shows, adding more broadcasters, adding more camera crews.
[00:29:14.889 --> 00:29:17.871]  We're going to send a crew into Puerto Rico.
[00:29:18.371 --> 00:29:19.332]  Get some attention on that.
[00:29:20.012 --> 00:29:20.713]  Still no power.
[00:29:21.053 --> 00:29:21.933]  I mean, it's dire.
[00:29:22.474 --> 00:29:25.075]  So it takes a lot of money to fund all this, obviously.
[00:29:25.635 --> 00:29:26.156]  So please,
[00:29:28.004 --> 00:29:30.105]  Buy a lot of products from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:32.486]  They're game-changing supplements and nutraceuticals.
[00:29:33.066 --> 00:29:36.427]  Really great InfoWars.com ball hats, shirts.
[00:29:37.307 --> 00:29:38.768]  But we got Molon Labe shirts.
[00:29:38.928 --> 00:29:39.988]  You know, so much more.
[00:29:40.008 --> 00:29:44.370]  If you want to make a stand for free speech and wear a Trump's My President shirt, then that's great.

[00:29:49.051 --> 00:29:52.437]  And the little communists won't know what that is because they're so stupid and won't stab you in the back.

[00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:09.755]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.571]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:43.092 --> 00:33:48.335]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:50.076 --> 00:34:09.569]  So, as soon as I announced 15 minutes ago that at the bottom of the hour, where we are right now, 1133 Central Time, that we were going to be posting more evidence of Antifa working with radical Islam and connections to the reported
[00:34:11.337 --> 00:34:14.518]  Mass shooter suspect in Vegas.
[00:34:15.278 --> 00:34:24.020]  As soon as that happened, our IT people called another state, we've got some here as well, and said we've got a giant bot attack that just started on the site.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:29.362]  We're talking within minutes of me announcing it, trying to bring down InfoWars.com.
[00:34:30.082 --> 00:34:31.602]  So that site is up and down.
[00:34:31.622 --> 00:34:33.683]  We were barely able to even upload this report.
[00:34:34.483 --> 00:34:42.226]  Newswars.com is having it uploaded to it right now as a backup as well as PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:43.267 --> 00:34:49.849]  But I've been running around like a chicken with my head cut off working on this and having other sources give me information.
[00:34:50.189 --> 00:34:51.390]  But here's what we know right now.
[00:34:53.611 --> 00:35:04.055]  They've gone to total disinformation level and that tells you this is a major operation what we just witnessed and what everybody can smell coming out of the tragic events in Nevada.
[00:35:06.035 --> 00:35:06.895]  They're in Las Vegas.
[00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:20.562]  Again, they announced in the morning that ISIS had officially, on their website and on their own encrypted site, taken responsibility for it and even gave out the Islamic name of the reported shooter.
[00:35:24.384 --> 00:35:30.847]  Then, within hours, the media came out and said Alex Jones made it up.
[00:35:31.738 --> 00:35:33.259]  They said it in hundreds of publications.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.261]  Alex Jones made it up.
[00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:37.203]  ISIS never took responsibility.
[00:35:37.243 --> 00:35:41.687]  Now, the FBI officially said that ISIS came out and took responsibility.
[00:35:42.407 --> 00:35:43.588]  The British government came out.
[00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:45.550]  They did it on their official website.
[00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:48.153]  The media just totally is lying to the public.
[00:35:49.053 --> 00:35:51.536]  They've chosen me to be the symbol of fake news.
[00:35:51.876 --> 00:35:53.918]  And so they say, oh, it's Alex Jones.
[00:35:54.258 --> 00:35:58.281]  He says it's Deep State working with ISIS and ISIS never took responsibility.
[00:35:59.181 --> 00:36:02.482]  And then now today, the New York Times says it's not true.
[00:36:02.502 --> 00:36:05.483]  Fake news reported ISIS did it.
[00:36:05.743 --> 00:36:08.844]  They're not saying ISIS is wrong or ISIS is lying.
[00:36:09.425 --> 00:36:11.925]  They're just saying it never happened.
[00:36:13.706 --> 00:36:14.686]  Now what does that tell you?
[00:36:15.307 --> 00:36:19.928]  They don't want there to be a debate about this.
[00:36:21.889 --> 00:36:27.731]  They don't want you to know that individuals
[00:36:28.982 --> 00:36:32.044]  Organizations have come out and taken credit for it.
[00:36:32.324 --> 00:36:46.274]  They want to say we don't know what happened when a giant concert full of 23,000 people, 80 plus percent of them white, get targeted when the left says we're coming in October to start killing whites and Trump supporters.
[00:36:46.634 --> 00:36:48.055]  And we're going to overthrow the government.
[00:36:48.556 --> 00:36:53.840]  And we're getting armed and we're getting ready and in meeting halls all over the country.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.840]  Doug Hagman's exposed it.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.461]  Stephen Crowder's exposed it.
[00:36:57.721 --> 00:36:58.901]  Paul Watson's exposed it.
[00:36:59.201 --> 00:37:00.341]  Drudge Report's exposed it.
[00:37:00.621 --> 00:37:02.502]  Project Veritox has exposed it.
[00:37:02.862 --> 00:37:04.342]  We have all exposed it.
[00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:10.344]  And InfoWars has shown the videos and shown the articles and shown where they say they're doing it.
[00:37:10.424 --> 00:37:12.104]  I go to gun ranges to get intel.
[00:37:12.364 --> 00:37:17.125]  They say, yeah, most our business now isn't libertarians or conservatives.
[00:37:17.305 --> 00:37:20.186]  It's liberals in here preparing for a civil war.
[00:37:23.137 --> 00:37:30.382]  And there's just women with hijabs everywhere firing full-auto and semi-auto, because these are gun ranges where you can rent the guns and do it.
[00:37:31.843 --> 00:37:37.888]  So, new doomsdayers taking up arms and prepping for catastrophe are the American liberals.
[00:37:39.128 --> 00:37:39.909]  There's that article.
[00:37:42.491 --> 00:37:47.174]  But I'm going to do this right now.
[00:37:47.454 --> 00:37:51.758]  I'm going to get into some of the other news when we come back at the start of the next segment.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:38:02.947]  I'm going to get into the Middle Eastern connections and the evidence piling up there that they don't want you to discuss while the media plays dumb, just like they did to the Pulse nightclub, just like they did to San Bernardino.
[00:38:03.387 --> 00:38:15.496]  They wouldn't say for three plus years that Major Hassan killing 13 people at Fort Hood was an Islamic attack, even though he was in contact with Al Qaeda.
[00:38:16.673 --> 00:38:27.177]  and with all their top people and was planning it for two years and the CIA knew and did nothing and let the army psychologist prepare his attack.
[00:38:28.098 --> 00:38:30.559]  And when there's an attack, they tell you it's not Islamic.
[00:38:31.399 --> 00:38:35.901]  And it took years to have the army be reversed and have to admit it because of lawsuits.
[00:38:36.301 --> 00:38:40.843]  Fort Hood shooter, Nidal Hassan, petitions to be a citizen of Islamic State.
[00:38:42.008 --> 00:38:43.429]  But he's not involved with Islam.
[00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:59.374]  And it wasn't an Islamic terror attack, because the FBI, run by Mueller at the time, and the CIA run by Brennan, converted to Wahhabism, tells you Islamic terror doesn't exist in the official FBI manuals until Trump got in nine months ago.
[00:38:59.394 --> 00:39:01.115]  And now it does!
[00:39:02.516 --> 00:39:06.037]  So a group that tells you Islamic terror doesn't exist,
[00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:12.093]  Remember Obama would say, hold on, these Al Qaeda attacks, they're not in Islam.
[00:39:12.573 --> 00:39:13.414]  That's not Islamic.
[00:39:13.434 --> 00:39:16.417]  The media would say, yes sir, we're now little parrots.
[00:39:16.777 --> 00:39:18.139]  Islamic terror doesn't exist.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.081]  And water doesn't exist.
[00:39:21.662 --> 00:39:22.743]  And the sky doesn't exist.
[00:39:24.184 --> 00:39:25.385]  And I'm not wearing a blue jacket.
[00:39:25.786 --> 00:39:26.366]  And a white shirt.
[00:39:27.507 --> 00:39:28.949]  I mean, this is the level.
[00:39:29.229 --> 00:39:31.051]  Of course they're covering it up!
[00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:36.532]  Of course they're covering up the fact that there's these Islamic connections.
[00:39:36.752 --> 00:39:38.333]  Does that mean it's absolutely Islamic?
[00:39:38.513 --> 00:39:39.674]  Does that mean it's open and shut?
[00:39:39.874 --> 00:39:40.994]  Does that mean it's case closed?
[00:39:41.335 --> 00:39:41.635]  No!
[00:39:43.916 --> 00:39:56.523]  But the history, the motive, the left working with them, Antifa working with them, this whole constellation of information, and the government's history of covering it up, and the time frame we're in,
[00:39:58.789 --> 00:40:12.735]  And everything we've witnessed, I told you, they're going to start mass shootings all over the country, they're going to blame conservatives, they're going to blame libertarians, when it's their people doing it as the pretext.
[00:40:14.396 --> 00:40:16.577]  And it won't matter how much evidence it's a leftist.
[00:40:16.817 --> 00:40:18.398]  It won't matter if it's an Islamist.
[00:40:18.638 --> 00:40:23.660]  They're going to say, the NRA and American gun owners are terrorists, and you are to blame.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.961]  Shame on you!
[00:40:26.761 --> 00:40:34.246]  And whether it is CBS News or CNN or ABC News or MSNBC or even Fox News is like CNN Lite now.
[00:40:34.306 --> 00:40:34.986]  It's unwatchable.
[00:40:36.447 --> 00:40:37.828]  Put CNN was like 10 years ago.
[00:40:38.908 --> 00:40:48.274]  They're all saying it's American gun owners and it's our fault and Jimmy Kimmel's crying and they're saying the NRA's terrorist which means you're a terrorist and this is how it works.
[00:40:48.614 --> 00:40:51.136]  Now all gun owners aren't just white supremacist or Russian agents.
[00:40:53.183 --> 00:40:54.084]  You're now a terrorist.
[00:40:54.104 --> 00:40:56.806]  We're going to play those clips coming up as well.
[00:40:57.347 --> 00:40:58.328]  We're going to analyze it all.
[00:40:58.588 --> 00:40:59.909]  Jimmy Kimmel up there with a gun.
[00:40:59.949 --> 00:41:00.670]  Can we cue that up?
[00:41:01.791 --> 00:41:07.095]  Where he has a 9mm look-alike pellet gun and shoots it and says, we're going to kill you, Alex.
[00:41:08.837 --> 00:41:09.998]  This is a guy with bodyguards.
[00:41:10.438 --> 00:41:11.800]  But he didn't want you to be able to have a gun.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.122]  Powerful article on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:18.181]  By Paul Watson showing his armed bodyguards, but you can't.
[00:41:18.321 --> 00:41:18.982]  They're hypocrites.
[00:41:19.162 --> 00:41:20.182]  We're in an info war.
[00:41:20.363 --> 00:41:23.645]  Let's hit them with the truth and understand they're getting ready for more terror attacks.
[00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:24.966]  It's here.
[00:41:25.006 --> 00:41:25.546]  The season's here.
[00:41:25.686 --> 00:41:25.887]  Boom!
[00:41:26.027 --> 00:41:26.667]  Told you it was coming.
[00:41:26.827 --> 00:41:27.087]  It's here.
[00:41:27.107 --> 00:41:30.290]  Before we go any further, people are really responding to this.
[00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:31.451]  I don't know how long we can run it.
[00:41:32.071 --> 00:41:38.736]  Brain Force Plus, now 20% more caplets in each bottle, is 50% off the regular price.
[00:41:40.478 --> 00:41:41.639]  Our last pig special was 40%.
[00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:45.741]  We've never done 50, but people are really responding to this.
[00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:49.503]  And so as you order more and we're able to fund our operation, I can go down in price.
[00:41:50.364 --> 00:41:49.503]  50.
[00:41:50.644 --> 00:41:51.064]  That's 50% off.
[00:41:51.084 --> 00:41:53.205]  It's $19.96 right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:53.245 --> 00:41:53.926]  $19 and change.
[00:41:59.489 --> 00:42:00.791]  50, it's actually 50.04% off.
[00:42:00.932 --> 00:42:03.516]  It's over 50% off.
[00:42:04.056 --> 00:42:07.862]  Brain Force Plus, we can probably run this through next week because we ordered a lot of it.
[00:42:08.143 --> 00:42:10.186]  But this is a mega special, never before done.
[00:42:10.506 --> 00:42:12.549]  Try the nootropic brain pill for yourself.
[00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:13.531]  It's amazing!
[00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:17.134]  Secret 12 is 40% off.
[00:42:17.174 --> 00:42:18.474]  That's got to end very, very soon.

[00:47:06.552 --> 00:47:09.194]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:30.442 --> 00:47:47.805]  Coming up in a few minutes, I'm going to tweet on Real Alex Jones, if you're discretion advised, a reported photo of the shooter.
[00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:51.186]  It looks like the floor from the videos I've seen, and the photo looks real.
[00:47:51.906 --> 00:47:54.607]  A photo of the reported shooter.
[00:47:54.987 --> 00:47:56.727]  He may be a patsy, he may be a cutout.
[00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:04.951]  But we're going to tweet that at Real Alex Jones on Twitter, coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:48:06.052 --> 00:48:10.536]  Now that said, ladies and gentlemen, when we're looking at
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.840]  You have the current atmosphere.
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.621]  You have the left saying in October, November, we're going to launch massive attacks.
[00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:17.462]  We're getting weapons.
[00:48:17.782 --> 00:48:18.602]  We're going to shoot you.
[00:48:18.622 --> 00:48:19.422]  We're going to kill you.
[00:48:19.802 --> 00:48:20.883]  We're going to kill the president.
[00:48:20.903 --> 00:48:22.083]  We're going to kill his supporters.
[00:48:22.423 --> 00:48:23.543]  We're going to kill the media.
[00:48:23.583 --> 00:48:24.664]  We're going to kill Congress.
[00:48:25.064 --> 00:48:26.544]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:48:27.264 --> 00:48:35.607]  They have Wolf Blitzer saying, hey, the guy that, you know, went out there and shot people at the baseball field, you know, he did this because he was politically upset.
[00:48:38.328 --> 00:48:39.108]  That's what's happening.
[00:48:40.049 --> 00:48:44.151]  There is a worldwide advance of Antifa, the Antifa fascist activist movement.
[00:48:45.151 --> 00:48:51.334]  And there is an exclusive story on NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:48:52.115 --> 00:48:55.496]  Report, Antifa receiving military training in Syria.
[00:48:56.196 --> 00:48:59.458]  Vegas shooter's girlfriend traveled to the Middle East.
[00:49:01.459 --> 00:49:05.541]  And this breaks down the photos, the videos and more.
[00:49:07.139 --> 00:49:23.150]  Of how different Islamic groups, from the Kurds to the Wahhabis to you name it, have been actively working with the left in America and have been tracked paying for American Antifa operations and giving them the training they need to carry out attacks.
[00:49:24.051 --> 00:49:30.695]  And that these particular groups that have been identified are Muslims with communist affiliations, particularly the Kurds.
[00:49:31.696 --> 00:49:44.059]  Editors know, just like the Pulse nightclub massacre, the San Bernardino attack, and the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, the mainstream media is doing everything it can to cover up the connection between Islamic terrorism and major massacres on U.S.
[00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:44.399]  soil.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.620]  That's a fact.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.080]  They've done it over and over again.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.941]  ISIS claimed responsibility.
[00:49:49.981 --> 00:49:54.902]  The Associated Press said yesterday morning, ISIS is almost always accurate when it claims responsibility.
[00:49:56.162 --> 00:49:58.303]  They don't reclaim responsibility when they haven't done it.
[00:49:59.977 --> 00:50:03.439]  Then by afternoon they said it was made up by me with no proof.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.843]  They said Jones claims ISIS is involved with Deep State.
[00:50:08.843 --> 00:50:12.986]  Well we know the Deep State that Trump can't kick out ran the whole Arab Spring and the rest of it.
[00:50:13.286 --> 00:50:13.867]  That's a fact.
[00:50:14.708 --> 00:50:22.913]  So just like the Pulse nightclub massacre, the San Bernardino attack in California, the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, the mainstream media is doing everything it can
[00:50:23.814 --> 00:50:27.837]  to cover up the connection between Islamic terrorism and major massacres on U.S.
[00:50:27.857 --> 00:50:28.157]  soil.
[00:50:28.798 --> 00:50:36.984]  Establishment reporters are even claiming it's fake news, that ISIS took responsibility for the attack, even though they did take responsibility for the attack.
[00:50:37.265 --> 00:50:51.196]  The following article reveals the dark triad of Antifa, Kurdish members of ISIS and anarcho-communist Kurds, and by implication, why a country music festival, the Bastion of Flyover Country Americana, was targeted.
[00:50:52.639 --> 00:50:54.960]  For background, read this related article first.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:00.162]  FBI source, Vegas shooter found with Antifa literature photos taken in Middle East.
[00:51:00.242 --> 00:51:01.923]  That was later confirmed after we broke that.
[00:51:03.003 --> 00:51:04.424]  That she was in the Middle East in the photos.
[00:51:04.804 --> 00:51:15.669]  Members of Antifa are illegally crossing the Syrian border to receive military training from Kurdish militants as part of a dark trial between Antifa anarcho-communist Kurds and Kurdish members of ISIS.
[00:51:16.857 --> 00:51:30.863]  The U.S.-backed Kurdish People's Protection Units, YPG, has anarcho-communist politics, which also attracted American and European Antifa to fight alongside them in what they refer to as the Rojova Revolution.
[00:51:30.903 --> 00:51:31.584]  That's been in the news.
[00:51:32.404 --> 00:51:37.868]  Security agencies are concerned that these Antifa members will continue the revolution at home once they return.
[00:51:38.268 --> 00:51:47.835]  Already FBI sources have received Antifa literature and photos taken in the Middle East which were found in the hotel room of the suspected Las Vegas shooter Steven Paddock.
[00:51:53.854 --> 00:51:58.715]  And I'm going to show you the photo right now, reportedly taken in the hotel room of the reported shooter.
[00:51:59.075 --> 00:52:01.075]  It could clearly be a Patsy taken up there and killed.
[00:52:01.376 --> 00:52:02.576]  The folks that actually did it escaped.
[00:52:03.156 --> 00:52:04.976]  But there is the gruesome photo.
[00:52:05.716 --> 00:52:07.897]  Looks real to me.
[00:52:08.117 --> 00:52:09.457]  Was it death by suicide?
[00:52:09.997 --> 00:52:11.157]  Massacre by suicide?
[00:52:12.118 --> 00:52:13.258]  Some type of fantasy deal?
[00:52:13.678 --> 00:52:15.178]  Like we've seen Prozac heads before?
[00:52:15.798 --> 00:52:17.619]  Or was he radicalized by jihadis?
[00:52:18.099 --> 00:52:18.919]  Was he a leftist?
[00:52:18.939 --> 00:52:20.999]  They're the ones calling for it and saying hunt Republicans.
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:22.580]  Where do you find a big group of them?
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.560]  Country music.
[00:52:25.199 --> 00:52:29.260]  We're investigating and everything we're seeing is very plausible, historic, based on reality.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.781]  The media is telling you they have no idea, they don't know why.
[00:52:32.141 --> 00:52:47.744]  You know, if that had been a hip-hop concert with a mainly urban population of black folks, you know within minutes the media would say he was a white supremacist there to kill black people, even if they never found a motive or ever had any evidence.
[00:52:48.104 --> 00:52:49.965]  You'd hear that, you'd never hear the end of it.
[00:52:51.311 --> 00:52:54.253]  If an NFL game was attacked by a white guy, you'd hear the same thing.
[00:52:54.273 --> 00:52:54.953]  And that's what we're saying.
[00:52:55.213 --> 00:52:56.294]  We think they'll probably pull.
[00:52:58.255 --> 00:53:07.701]  But instead, ladies and gentlemen, instead we're sitting here looking at this and watching this unfold and they're all playing dumb as everyone searches for the motive.
[00:53:08.882 --> 00:53:11.483]  The motive and the background has been found.
[00:53:11.543 --> 00:53:13.124]  He has Islamic connections.
[00:53:13.184 --> 00:53:13.905]  They have made
[00:53:15.259 --> 00:53:17.860]  Claims of responsibility, ISIS has.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.721]  You have the media desperately trying to cover that up, acting like it never even happened when it did.
[00:53:26.542 --> 00:53:39.125]  But the FBI, still run by the Globalist, says no link found, even though our sources, and it was later confirmed, say she went to the Middle East, and there were photos of that, and Islamic literature inside, along with Antifa.
[00:53:42.315 --> 00:53:44.576]  I mean, you had them wearing hijabs.
[00:53:45.317 --> 00:53:52.140]  You had the San Bernardino attacker lady going to the Middle East over and over again, and they were going to try to say they weren't Islamic in their attack.
[00:53:57.042 --> 00:54:03.186]  That's how stupid they think every single one of us are.
[00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:11.670]  I'm going to be opening the phones up later in the broadcast to go over all of this, but the report continues with the background, the evidence,
[00:54:13.103 --> 00:54:25.734]  How they're finding all over Syria different rebel forces with the Antifa flag linking up with the communists and saying that they're planning attacks inside the United States.
[00:54:27.535 --> 00:54:35.462]  Rolling Stone interviewed international western leftists that are fighting for the YPG, including Americans.
[00:54:38.564 --> 00:54:44.288]  And the fact that these anti-communist militants have women who are fighting ISIS is something that is often repeated.
[00:54:44.688 --> 00:54:55.275]  Antifa groups in Europe and North America have posted photos of their fighters holding up the Kurdish YPG flag along with the Antifa flag in Syria.
[00:54:56.698 --> 00:54:57.759]  And that's just some of the news.
[00:54:57.819 --> 00:54:59.239]  It goes on and on.
[00:54:59.279 --> 00:55:09.805]  You definitely want to read the full report for yourself on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:55:09.865 --> 00:55:13.867]  And the big one is the article Kit Daniels wrote that's linked first in the article.
[00:55:14.587 --> 00:55:16.628]  Vegas shooter found with Antifa literature.
[00:55:16.968 --> 00:55:18.309]  Photos taken in the Middle East.
[00:55:18.509 --> 00:55:19.169]  FBI source.
[00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.211]  And that's before it even came out that there were photos of her.
[00:55:23.655 --> 00:55:25.156]  Going to the Middle East and all the rest of it.
[00:55:25.176 --> 00:55:27.416]  And we're not saying that he's even the real guy.
[00:55:27.516 --> 00:55:28.757]  This could be a total cut out.
[00:55:29.457 --> 00:55:31.218]  The point is, look at the timing.
[00:55:31.258 --> 00:55:33.339]  Look at the left saying this was coming October 1st.
[00:55:33.839 --> 00:55:35.740]  And the real launch being November 4th.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.400]  They have got their people geared up.
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:38.721]  They've got them hyped up.
[00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:39.561]  They've got them ready.
[00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:41.402]  And they've got them prepared to strike.
[00:55:42.262 --> 00:55:57.091]  And you've got Jimmy Kimmel meeting with Schumer, admittedly, planning his political attack, and the other talk show host, they're using the teleprompter reading, fake newsmen comedians, as the new voice of the globalists, because they know mainstream news is dead.
[00:55:58.811 --> 00:56:03.234]  So now they just have emotional crying every couple nights from Kimmel, when he's not.
[00:56:03.254 --> 00:56:04.935]  In fact, let's roll that video as we go to break.
[00:56:05.575 --> 00:56:10.558]  Here's Kimmel with a model of a 9mm, with a real pellet gun, in
[00:56:14.008 --> 00:56:19.991]  His in-studio audience shooting a jar of pickles and saying, you know, Alex, you better shut your mouth.
[00:56:20.771 --> 00:56:23.572]  Here he is playing with guns while with a studio audience.
[00:56:23.592 --> 00:56:24.173]  Totally dangerous.
[00:56:24.213 --> 00:56:24.753]  I never knew that.
[00:56:25.393 --> 00:56:35.218]  And on top of it, on top of it all, while he has up to six, seven, eight, nine bodyguards with guns, we have photos of it on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:35.438 --> 00:56:35.778]  Here it is.
[00:56:36.303 --> 00:56:39.706]  It stops now because I'm afraid this little game is over, Alex.
[00:56:40.006 --> 00:56:45.930]  Now that you had to go and open your big mouth, I have no choice but to kill these pickles.
[00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:48.592]  This is all messages.
[00:56:48.612 --> 00:56:50.834]  The use of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:55.517]  Now, he didn't know this was all a coded message, but I've talked to high-level CIA and that's what that was.
[00:57:03.403 --> 00:57:05.465]  So, you say the new world order sends its regards.
[00:57:08.746 --> 00:57:09.647]  I guess they did.
[00:57:10.448 --> 00:57:13.072]  I guess they did Sunday night, bro, didn't they?
[00:57:13.592 --> 00:57:15.735]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex.
[00:57:16.796 --> 00:57:18.598]  And they admit we lost her that election.
[00:57:18.638 --> 00:57:19.720]  We defeated them.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.521]  You defeated them.
[00:57:20.841 --> 00:57:26.088]  And now they're ever searching, ever scanning, ever trying to figure out how to start this big fat juicy war.
[00:57:27.972 --> 00:57:28.972]  And they're the fake news.
[00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:29.673]  They're our enemies.
[00:57:29.693 --> 00:57:30.473]  They're the globalists.
[00:57:31.073 --> 00:57:35.995]  They want to hold us hostage with their operatives out there mowing down folks at a country music event.
[00:57:36.396 --> 00:57:37.296]  Look at who they hit.
[00:57:37.496 --> 00:57:38.376]  Look at the target.
[00:57:38.617 --> 00:57:39.477]  There's your motive.
[00:57:39.657 --> 00:57:42.178]  Then the Islamic connections and the Antifa connections.
[00:57:42.938 --> 00:57:46.100]  All the evidence points towards it, but they're saying, don't look there, don't look there.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:47.961]  Hour number two coming up.
[00:57:48.221 --> 00:57:48.821]  Stay with us.
[00:57:52.532 --> 00:57:54.934]  And we're not getting what humans always thought was key.
[00:57:55.134 --> 00:57:55.815]  The bone broth.
[00:57:56.536 --> 00:57:58.057]  The bone broth.
[00:57:58.277 --> 00:57:59.618]  The bone broth.
[00:57:59.698 --> 00:58:00.459]  The bone broth.
[00:58:00.739 --> 00:58:01.380]  The bone broth.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:02.921]  The bone broth.
[00:58:03.441 --> 00:58:05.043]  Well, now it's the next level of that.
[00:58:05.123 --> 00:58:05.824]  It's caveman.
[00:58:06.524 --> 00:58:07.865]  Hey, I need a glass of caveman.
[00:58:08.226 --> 00:58:08.666]  Caveman.
[00:58:09.307 --> 00:58:09.567]  Mmm.
[00:58:09.987 --> 00:58:10.788]  Mmm.
[00:58:10.808 --> 00:58:11.308]  Mmm, man.
[00:58:11.388 --> 00:58:11.629]  Mmm.
[00:58:12.009 --> 00:58:13.010]  It's better than Ovaltine.
[00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:14.111]  Better than Ovaltine.
[00:58:14.191 --> 00:58:14.311]  Mmm.
[00:58:14.551 --> 00:58:15.732]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:58:16.152 --> 00:58:16.912]  It's unbelievable.
[00:58:17.633 --> 00:58:19.294]  Caveman is just over the top.
[00:58:19.794 --> 00:58:21.395]  What in the world?
[00:58:21.555 --> 00:58:24.997]  But now with the milk, I was like, whoa, this has milk in it.
[00:58:25.457 --> 00:58:26.518]  It tastes like good.
[00:58:26.818 --> 00:58:27.678]  Man, this tastes so good.
[00:58:28.899 --> 00:58:30.660]  Tastes like the best milkshake ever.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.561]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:58:32.621 --> 00:58:33.401]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:58:33.421 --> 00:58:34.422]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:58:43.746 --> 00:58:50.393]  I can say without a doubt, at least in my experience, this is a super home run available at InfoWarsLife.com and it supports the broadcast.
[00:58:50.533 --> 00:58:51.975]  Alright, all the big news straight ahead.
[00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:57.012]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:58:57.373 --> 00:59:04.477]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:59:05.118 --> 00:59:13.463]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:59:13.744 --> 00:59:17.826]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:59:18.146 --> 00:59:23.490]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:27.593]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:59:27.974 --> 00:59:31.116]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:59:31.397 --> 00:59:42.466]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:59:42.526 --> 00:59:45.208]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:59:45.449 --> 00:59:51.414]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:59:54.884 --> 00:59:58.976]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.518 --> 01:00:00.822]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:08.482 --> 01:00:14.045]  The TruthAboutGuns.com gun expert is going to be in studio coming up with us in 30 minutes.
[01:00:14.606 --> 01:00:18.088]  Michael Snyder is going to be on with us, and so much more.
[01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:23.130]  And I'm going to get into all the lies as late night television openly declares war on the Second Amendment.
[01:00:23.651 --> 01:00:25.972]  Clearly the left is making their move to take down this country.
[01:00:25.992 --> 01:00:32.496]  But first, part of a powerful report that Paul Watson's put out, the Las Vegas massacre, what they're not telling you.
[01:00:33.854 --> 01:00:39.098]  More than 50 people were killed and hundreds injured in the deadliest mass shooting in US history.
[01:00:39.158 --> 01:00:50.446]  And the left, which tells us to carry on as normal after every single Islamic terror attack, began screeching that we can't carry on as normal in this case and that new laws must be passed immediately.
[01:00:50.506 --> 01:00:51.307]  Gun control now!
[01:00:51.367 --> 01:00:52.007]  Enough already!
[01:00:52.047 --> 01:00:52.728]  Grow the f*** up!
[01:00:52.748 --> 01:00:54.529]  The average person doesn't need a f***ing machine gun!
[01:00:54.569 --> 01:00:55.109]  Enough already!
[01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:55.430]  Enough!
[01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:55.870]  Enough!
[01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:56.110]  Yeah.
[01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:00.611]  The average person doesn't have a machine gun because they're already banned.
[01:01:00.711 --> 01:01:06.692]  Before the bodies were even culled, Hillary Clinton seized on the tragedy to push for silencers to be banned.
[01:01:06.772 --> 01:01:12.434]  Despite the fact that a fully auto machine gun, used by the killer, literally melts silencers.
[01:01:12.474 --> 01:01:15.514]  This had nothing whatsoever to do with silencers.
[01:01:15.574 --> 01:01:17.755]  Put politics aside, tweeted Hillary.
[01:01:17.895 --> 01:01:22.239]  Well, she literally made it all about politics in the very same sentence.
[01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:31.569]  Listen, unless you've got a method of just spiriting away all the gun parts and all the guns in America in one single wish, more gun laws aren't gonna stop this.
[01:01:31.749 --> 01:01:34.612]  Unless the fully auto was purchased before 1986, highly unlikely,
[01:01:37.074 --> 01:01:38.515]  It was illegal anyway.
[01:01:38.635 --> 01:01:44.439]  Criminals and terrorists will find weapons whatever the law is because they don't abide by the law.
[01:01:44.499 --> 01:01:52.164]  The ISIS terrorists who carried out the Paris massacre were able to obtain semi-automatic weapons despite stringent gun control laws.
[01:01:52.264 --> 01:01:56.027]  Terrorists are stabbing people in France on an almost weekly basis.
[01:01:56.287 --> 01:01:57.368]  Do we ban knives?
[01:01:57.528 --> 01:02:00.770]  Last time I checked, mass murder was already illegal.
[01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:04.613]  Was this an Islamic terror attack carried out by a Muslim convert?
[01:02:04.793 --> 01:02:10.498]  Senior US officials say no, but ISIS itself says its own soldier carried out the massacre.
[01:02:10.538 --> 01:02:12.900]  But ISIS claims responsibility for everything!
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.522]  No, that's not strictly true.
[01:02:14.642 --> 01:02:22.069]  As the Associated Press reports, ISIS is not known to have claimed any attacks to which it was not, at least, loosely linked.
[01:02:22.149 --> 01:02:28.074]  For example, the Edmonton attack yesterday when a Somali migrant struck police and pedestrians with a vehicle.
[01:02:28.194 --> 01:02:34.921]  ISIS didn't claim responsibility for that, despite the fact that the terrorists supported ISIS and had an ISIS flag in the vehicle.
[01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:42.529]  Others say ISIS is getting desperate and only claiming responsibility for the attack to compensate for huge losses on the battlefield.
[01:02:42.569 --> 01:02:47.875]  The shooter's family said they didn't talk to him much recently, but that he wasn't political or religious.
[01:02:47.995 --> 01:02:51.998]  But then again, ISIS did warn that the Las Vegas Strip was a target.
[01:02:52.058 --> 01:02:55.781]  And surely this can't be someone who just went postal on a whim.
[01:02:55.841 --> 01:03:01.426]  This was a well-planned-out, long-distance attack that used an arsenal of weaponry and ammo.
[01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:07.391]  And who was the woman, described as Hispanic, that told concertgoers they were about to die?
[01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:16.098]  So there was a lady who pushed her way forward into the concert venue, into the first row, and she started messing with another lady and told us that we were all gonna die tonight.
[01:03:18.436 --> 01:03:19.637]  Do you know why she was saying that?
[01:03:19.677 --> 01:03:22.338]  I mean, was this after the shots were fired?
[01:03:22.538 --> 01:03:25.840]  It was about 45 minutes before the shots were actually fired.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.961]  But then she was escorted out by security.
[01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:31.463]  That doesn't fit with the authorities' claim that it was a lone wolf attack.
[01:03:31.523 --> 01:03:36.386]  What we do know is that the shooter, 64-year-old Steven Paddock, is white.
[01:03:36.566 --> 01:03:39.448]  So obviously that must mean all white people are to blame.
[01:03:39.868 --> 01:03:51.013]  Say the same people who will scream bloody murder when you talk about Islamic terrorism and accuse you of collectively demonising all Muslims while they collectively demonise an entire race of people.
[01:03:51.073 --> 01:03:58.396]  Despite the fact that the event being a country music show undoubtedly means that the vast majority of victims are white people.
[01:03:58.516 --> 01:04:02.137]  A fact that was celebrated by some on the far left.
[01:04:02.277 --> 01:04:08.680]  Including this CBS exec who said she had no sympathy because most of the victims were Republicans.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.501]  It's the white supremacist patriarchy, stupid!
[01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:17.444]  Yeah, because if I was a white supremacist, the first thing I'd target is that well-known non-white venue.
[01:04:18.224 --> 01:04:19.505]  A country music concert.
[01:04:19.545 --> 01:04:23.347]  Gun control debates that don't include disarming an increasingly militarized police force are garbage.
[01:04:23.367 --> 01:04:26.788]  Disarm the very people who stopped the massacre.
[01:04:26.868 --> 01:04:27.709]  Genius, mate.
[01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.629]  Genius.
[01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:30.889]  Number of Americans killed on battlefields in all wars in history, 1,396,733.
[01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:31.770]  Killed by firearms in the US since 1968, 1,516,863.
[01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:32.290]  Let that sink in.
[01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:34.650]  Number of unarmed civilians killed by governments in the 20th century alone, 262 million.
[01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:35.271]  Let that sink in.
[01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:37.331]  While Trump asked the country to unite, Vox responded with this.
[01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:39.011]  White American men are a bigger domestic terrorist threat than Muslim
[01:04:54.875 --> 01:04:55.435]  Foreigners!
[01:04:55.835 --> 01:04:55.435]  1.
[01:04:56.195 --> 01:04:58.656]  These figures don't include 9-11.
[01:04:58.676 --> 01:04:58.656]  2.
[01:04:58.956 --> 01:05:02.818]  Try importing millions of Muslim migrants and then run the numbers again.

[01:06:15.032 --> 01:06:17.715]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:18.316 --> 01:06:20.278]  And now, your host, Mike Stewart.
[01:06:47.146 --> 01:06:50.129]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:50.289 --> 01:06:51.610]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:56.414 --> 01:06:59.336]  We have a special guest joining us in studio coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:06:59.436 --> 01:07:12.527]  If you just tuned in, just like San Bernardino, just like Fort Hood, just like the Pulse nightclub, every time there's an Islamic attack, the FBI is ordered to say it's not an Islamic attack.
[01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:21.009]  And 90% of the FBI has been put in place the last 20 plus years that the Clintons and the Obamas and others were in control.
[01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:34.013]  It's a totally different culture where they hire people like Reality Winner with top secret clearances that hates all white people even though she's white and wants a violent communist revolution and joins ISIS.
[01:07:35.473 --> 01:07:36.973]  So Islamic State takes credit.
[01:07:36.993 --> 01:07:39.074]  The AP says that Islamic State
[01:07:40.037 --> 01:08:02.185]  is generally truthful about things they take credit for and then the media just ignores that and now says it's fake news Islamic State never did when they did take credit so the fact the media is ball-faced lying shows they got something to cover up here like they do every time and the FBI is still very very political we had agents break ranks
[01:08:03.226 --> 01:08:05.647]  And Sam Bernardino and other events say no, it was Islamic.
[01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:10.390]  They tried to say Hassan killing 13 people was not Islamic at Fort Hood.
[01:08:11.751 --> 01:08:16.293]  Even though he pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda and then he's done from his jail cell, he's pledged allegiance to ISIS.
[01:08:18.034 --> 01:08:20.456]  So, that's what's going on.
[01:08:21.499 --> 01:08:24.902]  They are desperately trying to keep everybody away from this.
[01:08:25.683 --> 01:08:27.825]  First they say Islamic State has said they did it.
[01:08:28.185 --> 01:08:29.867]  They normally are very credible about that.
[01:08:29.887 --> 01:08:30.867]  Associated Press.
[01:08:31.328 --> 01:08:34.090]  Then hours later, well, they said they did it, but without proof.
[01:08:34.871 --> 01:08:37.614]  And then now, oh, it's totally made up by Alex Jones.
[01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:38.674]  That's what Newsweek said.
[01:08:39.867 --> 01:08:47.273]  And Salon and Raw Story and all the usual folks that get their directives from Media Matters and George Soros, literally.
[01:08:47.994 --> 01:08:50.817]  They said, oh Alex Jones, deep state behind Las Vegas attack.
[01:08:50.837 --> 01:08:54.620]  And they go, yeah, Jones made it up and said ISIS was behind it.
[01:08:56.321 --> 01:08:58.183]  And that Al Gore was behind it.
[01:08:58.323 --> 01:08:59.784]  And that Phil Mudd was behind it.
[01:08:59.824 --> 01:09:00.905]  And I didn't say any of that.
[01:09:00.985 --> 01:09:04.488]  I said Al Gore and Phil Mudd said in the next two months we're going to start overthrowing Trump.
[01:09:05.529 --> 01:09:08.432]  And the left's been saying they got a big revolution coming in October.
[01:09:12.537 --> 01:09:15.860]  But notice when they quote me, they don't actually quote me until later.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:20.224]  And I said, isn't it weird OJ got released 20 hours before on a Saturday, Sunday night.
[01:09:20.504 --> 01:09:24.167]  So all the media would be there right on time, filling up Vegas trying to interview him.
[01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:25.108]  I mean, isn't that weird?
[01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:28.832]  And then the media has headlines.
[01:09:29.212 --> 01:09:31.294]  Alex Jones says OJ did it!
[01:09:32.295 --> 01:09:34.076]  Talk about fake news headlines.
[01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:34.897]  I didn't say that.
[01:09:35.658 --> 01:09:37.840]  I just said, isn't it a weird coincidence that OJ was there.
[01:09:39.704 --> 01:09:58.406]  Now I've talked to my Army and Navy SEAL contacts and others and they've all spent hours watching and listening to the videos and they say it sounds like multiple rifles firing semi-auto or full-auto at the same time and it's not just echoes.
[01:10:00.356 --> 01:10:07.142]  They've analyzed the audio and it's very clear at some points you've got multiple shooters going on.
[01:10:07.462 --> 01:10:08.583]  And we're supposed to question.
[01:10:08.783 --> 01:10:10.485]  They say they don't even know what happened.
[01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:13.667]  And they've got all their own mainstream media conspiracy theories.
[01:10:14.088 --> 01:10:19.452]  But when I start asking what's going on, well I'm the worst person on earth.
[01:10:19.492 --> 01:10:19.933]  Here's a clip.
[01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:34.370]  That is multiple firearms.
[01:10:39.915 --> 01:10:41.236]  And we've got witnesses to it.
[01:10:41.296 --> 01:10:43.498]  I mean, we've got hours of witnesses to it.
[01:10:44.019 --> 01:10:45.180]  Let's go to some of those witnesses.
[01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:47.249]  Clip after clip.
[01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:48.390]  Bullets flying everywhere.
[01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:49.271]  Everybody running.
[01:10:49.291 --> 01:10:50.732]  It was really, really bad.
[01:10:51.293 --> 01:10:54.616]  And you guys said that there were multiple shots fired at San Jose.
[01:10:54.636 --> 01:11:02.243]  We were on the furthest, we were the furthest VIP stages away from Mandalay Bay and they were ricocheting everywhere where we were.
[01:11:02.263 --> 01:11:08.228]  So it was, they were firing from somewhere high and they were unloading clip after clip after clip after clip.
[01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:09.890]  So there was a shooter, you believe?
[01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:10.670]  Multiple shooters.
[01:11:10.871 --> 01:11:11.711]  Multiple shooters.
[01:11:11.731 --> 01:11:12.252]  It has to be.
[01:11:12.552 --> 01:11:13.773]  How many people were hit?
[01:11:13.793 --> 01:11:14.193]  Did you see?
[01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:15.094]  We have no idea.
[01:11:15.114 --> 01:11:18.757]  Hopefully none, but there was obviously people hit.
[01:11:18.797 --> 01:11:20.158]  Did you guys see any victims?
[01:11:20.218 --> 01:11:21.980]  I mean, as far as... We just saw one drive by right now.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.181]  Hanging out of the back of the truck.
[01:11:23.201 --> 01:11:23.561]  Giving CPR.
[01:11:23.601 --> 01:11:25.523]  Because he had probably been shot.
[01:11:25.543 --> 01:11:26.744]  Out of the back of the truck right now.
[01:11:26.864 --> 01:11:27.324]  CPR.
[01:11:28.345 --> 01:11:28.565]  Wow.
[01:11:28.605 --> 01:11:33.049]  There's bullets ricocheting, like, bouncing down by the bottom of our feet as we all got on the floor crawling out.
[01:11:33.069 --> 01:11:34.670]  Let's go to one more witness as well.
[01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:35.371]  Here's another clip.
[01:11:37.419 --> 01:11:42.720]  15 was playing and we were in our booth and we thought it was fireworks.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.861]  And then it just didn't stop.
[01:11:45.521 --> 01:11:47.041]  And I'm like, Debbie, that's not fireworks.
[01:11:47.321 --> 01:11:52.482]  And then people started running and we asked what was going on and they said it was a shooter.
[01:11:52.602 --> 01:11:56.163]  And then we realized it sounded like machine guns.
[01:11:56.803 --> 01:11:58.343]  It sounded like more than one machine gun.
[01:11:58.963 --> 01:12:00.243]  And it just didn't stop.
[01:12:00.544 --> 01:12:01.444]  Like 30 minutes.
[01:12:02.004 --> 01:12:02.524]  What'd you guys do?
[01:12:03.371 --> 01:12:11.994]  We were hiding in a beer truck behind our booth in a Budweiser truck for about 30 minutes.
[01:12:12.574 --> 01:12:15.615]  I've got two different key pieces of news here we just joined us.
[01:12:17.035 --> 01:12:28.059]  The mainstream media is in concerted efforts being directed by Chuckie Schumer, they admit that in the news, on late night shows, you name it, to demonize gun owners and collectively say it's all our fault.
[01:12:29.127 --> 01:12:30.588]  That is sickening and that is evil.
[01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:39.134]  Number two, you have the very conservative Christian flyover folks being attacked that are being blamed by the media for doing it.
[01:12:39.194 --> 01:12:43.738]  You've got a CBS vice president saying they deserved it and she's not sorry for them.
[01:12:44.618 --> 01:12:51.183]  And I've got stacks of news of liberals and so-called movie stars out there saying that they got what they deserve and these are Trump supporters.
[01:12:51.483 --> 01:12:53.785]  I've got CNN saying these are mainly Trump supporters.
[01:12:54.285 --> 01:12:56.147]  And like, oh, look at the irony, you deserve it.
[01:12:56.767 --> 01:12:59.688]  I never blamed the gay folks at the Pulse nightclub.
[01:12:59.988 --> 01:13:06.651]  I said, why are you supporting ISIS and bringing in all these unvetted Muslims when they keep attacking you and throwing you off buildings?
[01:13:06.731 --> 01:13:08.871]  I wasn't saying it's your fault they killed you.
[01:13:09.412 --> 01:13:10.972]  I was saying, why are you supporting them?
[01:13:11.692 --> 01:13:16.734]  But the media that accused me of that is literally doing it.
[01:13:17.374 --> 01:13:19.775]  We'll play those clips coming up in the next segment.
[01:13:19.855 --> 01:13:24.637]  But the big takeaway here is we're in a war, an information war.
[01:13:25.976 --> 01:13:37.041]  You've got the Democrats calling for revolution at the shooting ranges, training for mass murder, working with Islamists, bringing them in, saying they're preparing a big communist overthrow, socialist overthrow, that's coming in October.
[01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:44.664]  And then you've got a group that would be targeted, Christian, white mainly, country music folks, veterans being hit.
[01:13:44.764 --> 01:13:45.925]  That's where you go to kill veterans.
[01:13:46.325 --> 01:13:48.086]  You've got a bunch of even kids getting killed.
[01:13:48.146 --> 01:13:49.026]  It's just nightmarish.
[01:13:50.187 --> 01:13:52.028]  And you've got the media blaming the victims.
[01:13:53.226 --> 01:14:01.068]  And you've got them ignoring the fact that ISIS took responsibility, that they normally only do that when it's real, when they've actually done it.
[01:14:01.508 --> 01:14:06.149]  You had all these other Islamic attacks on Sunday as well in Canada and other areas like France.
[01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:14.731]  And you've got his girlfriend, his live-in for many years, his, I guess they call it common law marriage, going to the Middle East.
[01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:15.831]  That's confirmed.
[01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:18.952]  And we had a high-level CIA guy on yesterday.
[01:14:20.546 --> 01:14:25.490]  Kevin Schiff saying it looks like a false flag to go after conservatives, and it's the same deal, and to go after the Second Amendment.
[01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:27.872]  That's the target, the NRA, the American gun owner.
[01:14:28.953 --> 01:14:44.986]  And the cherry on top of all this, you've got the fact that if you pull back and look at this, it's so incredibly obvious, because the media doesn't want you to say Islamic, they don't want you to look there when all the evidence is pointing there, and
[01:14:46.397 --> 01:14:47.978]  We have these incredible sources.
[01:14:48.098 --> 01:14:50.460]  I mean, I have sources right into the hostage rescue team.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.781]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:14:51.961 --> 01:15:06.671]  Not the hostage rescue team that did it, but people that are in the regional teams who talked to the folks, who reviewed the information within hours, and they said that there was Islamic paraphernalia and there was Antifa crap all over the place.
[01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:12.114]  Now, I immediately said, well that means they were either trying to set him up, why would they do that?
[01:15:12.495 --> 01:15:13.215]  Or it was real.
[01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:16.238]  But there's a blackout on that information.
[01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:17.759]  We tweeted it at real Alex Jones.
[01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:19.380]  A photo, it looks real.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:23.103]  It's the same flooring we've seen in the videos where a tourist shot it a year ago.
[01:15:24.204 --> 01:15:25.225]  Of him dead on the ground.
[01:15:25.725 --> 01:15:27.107]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[01:15:27.367 --> 01:15:29.208]  We're going to go out to break showing you that image.
[01:15:29.509 --> 01:15:30.830]  Was he brought up there and killed?
[01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:32.531]  And then whoever was really there escaped?
[01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:33.492]  We don't know.
[01:15:33.892 --> 01:15:37.115]  We just know this is the season of globalist control.
[01:15:38.277 --> 01:15:58.054]  We just know they're making their move on America and the deep states making their move and we predicted with precision and no amount of fake news can ignore that that they would trigger the new civil war with shootings at rock concerts or big venues or NFL events and now it's happening and they're blaming us the conservatives for it as we said they would do.
[01:15:58.374 --> 01:15:59.716]  It's here, we're right again.
[01:16:02.293 --> 01:16:06.797]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[01:17:11.427 --> 01:17:19.553]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:24.535]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:20:14.315 --> 01:20:14.875]  We've got it.
[01:20:14.915 --> 01:20:21.359]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:20:21.439 --> 01:20:25.561]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.622]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:31.485]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:44.358 --> 01:20:48.583]  Robert Farago, the owner of one of the most popular gun sites, if not the most in the world.
[01:20:49.104 --> 01:20:51.646]  TruthAboutGuns.com is going to be in the studio with us coming up.
[01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:54.370]  Michael Schneider is coming on.
[01:20:55.869 --> 01:20:59.570]  We've got other very informative guests that are gonna be joining us to discuss all this.
[01:20:59.590 --> 01:21:03.211]  I'm also gonna try to open the phones up, but I just want to hammer this home.
[01:21:03.811 --> 01:21:05.732]  Everybody gets too complacent with Trump in there.
[01:21:06.032 --> 01:21:07.852]  We're in a total war for this country.
[01:21:08.793 --> 01:21:14.454]  The globalists have overthrown countless other countries, and they start civil wars, and they do it with mass shootings.
[01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:17.555]  If you go back three years ago in Ukraine,
[01:21:18.834 --> 01:21:23.835]  There were mass shootings in town squares, claiming the police had shot peaceful demonstrations.
[01:21:24.316 --> 01:21:31.097]  That was cover for the elected government to be overthrown, and paramilitary groups to attack the police, who then stood down.
[01:21:33.078 --> 01:21:47.402]  So they have a formulae, and that's what we're looking at, and they're cold-blooded, and it fits the season, it fits the motive, it fits the time, it fits the target, then he has the Islamic connections, everything.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:56.426]  And suddenly, for the first time, when ISIS takes responsibility for something, we're told it's not credible, when every other time we were told it was credible.
[01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:03.591]  So that's the big issue that we're looking at.
[01:22:03.971 --> 01:22:08.055]  We have Brian Williams, the king of fake news, pushes gun control.
[01:22:08.355 --> 01:22:10.276]  A guy that claimed he was shot down in a helicopter.
[01:22:10.757 --> 01:22:12.178]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[01:22:13.339 --> 01:22:21.985]  We have all these FBI agents running around saying we are going to legalize grenades next because they want to legalize suppressors that aren't silencers.
[01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:28.429]  MSNBC wants to start banning ammo and restricting it and high-capacity mags.
[01:22:32.272 --> 01:22:33.393]  This is their big event.
[01:22:35.114 --> 01:22:36.455]  This is how they're coming after us.
[01:22:38.206 --> 01:23:03.233]  And we've got Jimmy Kimmel bashes gun rights after Las Vegas massacre and we can show you the article on Infowars.com with Jimmy Kimmel with video and photos of his bodyguards with their Glock pistols and more tucked in at his offices and at his house that protect him but he says you can't have a gun.
[01:23:06.297 --> 01:23:08.418]  That's how they operate.
[01:23:09.999 --> 01:23:11.840]  That's what they think of you.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:33.850]  Just like Piers Morgan had the company armed response at his house, a van that parked in front of his house with guys in the back of an air-conditioned van with guns protecting him and with cameras on it.
[01:23:35.421 --> 01:23:38.384]  And with a sign in his front yard saying, armed response.
[01:23:38.965 --> 01:23:41.547]  But he wants your guns!
[01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:46.492]  And then there's this creature who I want to play first.
[01:23:47.033 --> 01:23:48.835]  Just a little bit of it because I can't watch much of it.
[01:23:48.875 --> 01:23:53.259]  He calls the NRA terrorist, Keith Olbermann, the same one that said, Russian scum!
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.921]  We're at war with Russia!
[01:23:56.563 --> 01:23:58.425]  Well now he's pointing at his real enemy.
[01:23:59.346 --> 01:24:00.667]  The American gun owner.
[01:24:01.027 --> 01:24:11.614]  So let's go ahead and hear from the failed sportscaster reading off a teleprompter one more time, targeting his real enemy, the American people.
[01:24:12.474 --> 01:24:14.275]  I'm Keith Olbermann and this is the resistance.
[01:24:15.136 --> 01:24:18.758]  Warmest condolences and sympathies will not suffice.
[01:24:19.298 --> 01:24:19.599]  Oh really?
[01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:19.879]  Pause.
[01:24:19.899 --> 01:24:20.859]  We need leadership in this.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:22.520]  Back it up a few seconds please.
[01:24:23.201 --> 01:24:24.422]  Oh, but we've got the head of
[01:24:25.319 --> 01:24:28.500]  Programming over at CBS saying she's glad they died or they deserve it.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.980]  You've got all these so-called movie stars saying they deserve it.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.901]  You've got everybody on Twitter and Facebook saying it en masse and blaming them, saying now maybe you'll grow up.
[01:24:36.141 --> 01:24:37.582]  Now maybe you'll turn your guns in.
[01:24:38.042 --> 01:24:41.342]  Oberman, you're sick!
[01:24:42.623 --> 01:24:47.444]  And you've got all these senators going up on the floor and saying it's not enough to just send sympathy.
[01:24:47.604 --> 01:24:49.264]  We need to respond and ban guns.
[01:24:50.264 --> 01:24:50.484]  Really?
[01:24:50.504 --> 01:24:51.745]  You never want to ban anything?
[01:24:51.785 --> 01:24:53.665]  Like when the Islamists are coming in, Senator.
[01:24:56.235 --> 01:24:59.657]  Senator Murphy, let's continue with Keith Oberman.
[01:25:17.148 --> 01:25:28.185]  Instead, the House of Representatives is to vote this week to relax restrictions on buying silencers for firearms, so it becomes more difficult to hear where the gunfire is coming from.
[01:25:29.126 --> 01:25:32.271]  Instead, we have Las Vegas, and per the website,
[01:25:33.112 --> 01:25:34.553]  The gun violence archive.
[01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:38.174]  We have the 272nd mass shooting.
[01:25:38.594 --> 01:25:42.776]  And it took him 70 plus minutes to even find him and get in there.
[01:25:42.796 --> 01:25:44.737]  And how did he get all the guns in the hotel?
[01:25:44.757 --> 01:25:45.697]  40 plus guns.
[01:25:46.057 --> 01:25:47.738]  And then his family said he wasn't even into guns.
[01:25:48.198 --> 01:25:48.679]  On and on and on.
[01:25:48.699 --> 01:25:50.919]  Can we get to the part where he calls the NRA terrorists?
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.601]  Because I can't watch the whole thing.
[01:25:54.181 --> 01:25:56.682]  I mean, I can't subject myself to Keith Olbermann like that.
[01:25:57.816 --> 01:26:05.222]  The fake concern, the fake swollenness of his face, all the garbage he puts on.
[01:26:06.923 --> 01:26:18.973]  These people supported the Arab Spring that killed over a million people, putting radical jihadis in charge, killing all the Christians, enslaving women, putting them into sex slavery, selling little girls into sex slavery, and it's a big joke to them.
[01:26:20.094 --> 01:26:23.297]  Now there it is, Keith Olbermann, the NRA should be branded a terrorist organization.
[01:26:23.697 --> 01:26:24.698]  I watched it this morning.
[01:26:24.758 --> 01:26:26.059]  I should have been clear.
[01:26:26.259 --> 01:26:27.260]  There's a particular clip I want.
[01:26:28.581 --> 01:26:29.462]  That's all coming up.
[01:26:29.522 --> 01:26:33.244]  Before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war for the Second Amendment.
[01:26:33.284 --> 01:26:34.644]  But we're in a war for the First Amendment.
[01:26:34.664 --> 01:26:35.765]  They're coming for the First Amendment.
[01:26:36.025 --> 01:26:39.947]  They're saying ban conservative and libertarian sites because we're politically beating them.
[01:26:40.388 --> 01:26:48.772]  And culturally, they're losing the war on guns because people are going out and using guns and realizing that it's okay for them to protect themselves.
[01:26:49.092 --> 01:26:50.453]  And the answer is more guns.
[01:26:50.893 --> 01:26:53.735]  Because actual gun crime is down since 1992.
[01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.376]  Mass shootings are flat.
[01:26:56.527 --> 01:26:57.328]  They're flat still.
[01:26:57.969 --> 01:27:02.133]  So even though these are horrible events, hundreds of people a day die in their automobiles.
[01:27:02.594 --> 01:27:04.576]  Are we going to let them restrict our automobiles next?
[01:27:04.936 --> 01:27:07.800]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:09.124 --> 01:27:15.112]  We have some big specials that are going to be ending in the next couple days.
[01:27:15.633 --> 01:27:20.780]  That is Secret 12, the vitamin B12, super high quality, organic.
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:22.822]  BuzzFeed had a big lab test it.
[01:27:22.862 --> 01:27:26.407]  The lab said we have the highest quality they recommend.
[01:27:27.248 --> 01:27:28.951]  BuzzFeed didn't even know what to do with themselves.
[01:27:29.272 --> 01:27:35.161]  They said it's completely clean, California standards, and the highest quality for 40% off.
[01:27:35.762 --> 01:27:37.405]  They just couldn't believe it.
[01:27:37.425 --> 01:27:39.889]  It absolutely blew up in their face.
[01:27:39.989 --> 01:27:40.670]  It was ridiculous.
[01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:52.405]  But continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, Secret 12 is now 40% off retail for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:27:52.825 --> 01:27:55.986]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 50% off at the store.
[01:27:56.006 --> 01:27:59.546]  That's going to have to end in the next few days with all the amino acids and so much more.
[01:27:59.586 --> 01:28:00.486]  So great for your children.
[01:28:00.866 --> 01:28:04.267]  Very good tasting, a good way for them to really absorb their multivitamins.
[01:28:04.567 --> 01:28:06.507]  This is something especially old folks should be doing as well.
[01:28:07.008 --> 01:28:08.928]  Super Brain Force Special.
[01:28:09.608 --> 01:28:11.169]  Rainforest has never been 50% off.
[01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:12.229]  We got a big shipment in.
[01:28:12.569 --> 01:28:14.050]  The last special was 40% off.
[01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:15.090]  Before that, a third off.
[01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:18.511]  But we've got the manufacturing cost down a little bit.
[01:28:18.972 --> 01:28:20.912]  So now we have savings on some of these products.
[01:28:20.952 --> 01:28:22.153]  They're even bigger.
[01:28:22.573 --> 01:28:24.214]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:28:24.554 --> 01:28:25.474]  That's the new special.
[01:28:25.514 --> 01:28:28.975]  That's going to run at least for a week or until the supplies run too low.
[01:28:28.995 --> 01:28:31.296]  But it looks like we have enough at current sales rates for a week.
[01:28:31.376 --> 01:28:38.139]  But if you want the caveman bone broth formula with turmeric and so much more and chaga and
[01:28:40.529 --> 01:28:50.179]  You will be able to find that at Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com, but those specials are about to end.
[01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:52.302]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:29:02.498 --> 01:29:04.880]  And we're not getting what humans always thought was key.
[01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:05.821]  The bone broth.
[01:29:06.482 --> 01:29:08.024]  The bone broth.
[01:29:08.244 --> 01:29:09.585]  The bone broth.
[01:29:09.645 --> 01:29:10.346]  The bone broth.
[01:29:10.706 --> 01:29:11.807]  The bone broth.
[01:29:12.088 --> 01:29:12.848]  The bone broth.
[01:29:13.389 --> 01:29:14.991]  Well, now it's the next level of that.
[01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:15.791]  It's caveman.
[01:29:16.472 --> 01:29:17.833]  Hey, I need a glass of caveman.
[01:29:18.194 --> 01:29:18.754]  Caveman.
[01:29:19.235 --> 01:29:19.515]  Mmm.
[01:29:19.935 --> 01:29:20.176]  Mmm.
[01:29:20.636 --> 01:29:21.277]  Mmm, man.
[01:29:21.337 --> 01:29:21.557]  Mmm.
[01:29:21.957 --> 01:29:22.938]  It's better than Ovaltine.
[01:29:23.119 --> 01:29:24.060]  Better than Ovaltine.
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:24.280]  Mmm.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.660]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:26.881]  It's unbelievable.
[01:29:27.601 --> 01:29:29.241]  Caveman is just over the top.
[01:29:29.741 --> 01:29:31.322]  What in the world?
[01:29:31.502 --> 01:29:34.943]  But now with the milk, I was like, whoa, this has milk in it.
[01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:35.423]  Whoa.
[01:29:35.523 --> 01:29:36.443]  It tastes like good.
[01:29:36.803 --> 01:29:37.644]  Man, this tastes so good.
[01:29:38.864 --> 01:29:40.044]  Tastes like the best milkshake ever.
[01:29:41.145 --> 01:29:42.505]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:29:42.565 --> 01:29:43.886]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:29:43.966 --> 01:29:45.426]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:29:45.466 --> 01:29:46.246]  Like good.
[01:29:46.766 --> 01:29:48.107]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:29:48.167 --> 01:29:49.487]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:29:49.567 --> 01:29:51.028]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:29:51.068 --> 01:29:51.868]  Like good.
[01:29:52.108 --> 01:29:52.428]  Whoa.
[01:29:53.692 --> 01:30:00.360]  I can say without a doubt, at least in my experience, this is a super home run available at InfoWarsLive.com and it supports the broadcast.
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.062]  Alright, all the big news, straight ahead.
[01:30:10.813 --> 01:30:11.554]  Brandon Tatum.
[01:30:12.594 --> 01:30:17.877]  Last time I checked, like 50-something million views in just four or five days on his Facebook channel.
[01:30:18.297 --> 01:30:35.628]  But this is what's exciting, as the silent majority of every color, we're all the same race, the human race, all red blood, all want freedom for our children, all want a future, unless we're globalist, I guess, speaking out and just exploding and getting now over 100,000 followers on Facebook, and they haven't banned him yet.
[01:30:35.648 --> 01:30:38.550]  Instead of me asking the questions, what finally got you to go public?
[01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:43.032]  What finally got you to start speaking out like so many other silent majority people?
[01:30:43.132 --> 01:30:43.753]  I don't know, man.
[01:30:43.793 --> 01:30:47.615]  I feel like that I have an obligation to people.
[01:30:47.695 --> 01:30:49.236]  I have an obligation to this country.
[01:30:49.296 --> 01:30:53.319]  I have an obligation to my family to just keep it 100% real.
[01:30:53.879 --> 01:30:56.741]  And I felt like that when truth is revealed to me,
[01:30:57.481 --> 01:31:00.643]  I mean, I would be doing a disservice to people to not express that.
[01:31:00.763 --> 01:31:10.770]  And also, the frustration is what caused me to start coming out, because I couldn't hold it in anymore, that I felt like I've been lied to, and now the truth has been revealed.
[01:31:11.371 --> 01:31:13.392]  I have to say something about it, at all costs.
[01:31:13.912 --> 01:31:15.534]  Like I tell people, it's not about me.
[01:31:15.734 --> 01:31:17.957]  It's not that I'm such a great spokesperson.
[01:31:18.317 --> 01:31:23.683]  It's that God has put me in a position to have a platform to speak on behalf of other people.
[01:31:24.084 --> 01:31:29.270]  And I think that America spoke by a guy sitting in the car, you know,
[01:31:30.595 --> 01:31:36.597]  He's spewing out his heart in millions and millions of shares of that one video.
[01:31:36.677 --> 01:31:38.718]  It speaks to what America really feels.
[01:31:38.858 --> 01:31:42.759]  They have red carpets and Oscars for movies that 10 million people see.
[01:31:43.179 --> 01:31:47.501]  And so I'm just showing how obsolete they are now that all this competition has come.
[01:31:47.781 --> 01:31:49.202]  And then that's only one part of the story.
[01:31:49.462 --> 01:31:51.863]  Then there's the whole story about what you said.
[01:31:52.363 --> 01:31:56.464]  And then the NFL is trying to double down, even though at first they said, OK, we may back off.
[01:31:56.864 --> 01:31:58.145]  Now they want to double down.
[01:31:59.085 --> 01:32:03.151]  And people are trying to get black folks to get into this and this poll show.
[01:32:03.171 --> 01:32:03.872]  They're not buying it.
[01:32:04.212 --> 01:32:05.374]  What is the NFL thinking?
[01:32:05.394 --> 01:32:06.555]  I don't know what they're thinking.
[01:32:06.615 --> 01:32:09.459]  I don't know if this is some kamikaze mission or what.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.824]  I think what it is is deliberate mentality.
[01:32:12.844 --> 01:32:14.706]  I feel like that these people are being
[01:32:15.687 --> 01:32:21.449]  You know, tricked into, brainwashed into, forced into, shamed into acting this way.
[01:32:21.589 --> 01:32:31.671]  I think a few players decided to do something, and these owners are afraid of the backlash that they'll get from minority communities if they actually stand up for what's right.
[01:32:32.371 --> 01:32:34.232]  I have no idea what they're thinking about.
[01:32:34.252 --> 01:32:36.032]  This should not be happening in America.
[01:32:36.192 --> 01:32:39.213]  Brandon Tatum is our guest, police officer Patriot.
[01:32:40.245 --> 01:32:43.126]  The Officer Tatum on Twitter, Facebook, Tatumbug34.
[01:32:43.546 --> 01:32:46.166]  And that's where you go see 13 million views.
[01:32:46.506 --> 01:32:49.947]  Got other channels, 5 million here, 2 million there, 42 million here.
[01:32:49.967 --> 01:32:51.967]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:32:52.027 --> 01:32:53.367]  And again, that's just one of his videos.
[01:32:53.627 --> 01:32:54.727]  The other videos have millions.
[01:32:55.228 --> 01:32:56.928]  That shows folks love that truth.
[01:32:57.248 --> 01:32:57.728]  We'll be back.
[01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:09.050]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:10.987 --> 01:33:21.275]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commons.
[01:33:21.355 --> 01:33:27.239]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:33.744]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[01:33:33.844 --> 01:33:35.165]  It is a big idea.
[01:33:35.225 --> 01:33:36.426]  A new world order.
[01:33:40.879 --> 01:33:43.319]  It was almost as if it were planned in post.
[01:33:43.339 --> 01:33:44.460]  It's just pancakes.
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:47.720]  Either you're with us, or you're with the terrorists.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:34:10.365]  I also believe that a lot of governments would agree that AJ-47s belong to the hands of soldiers, not the hands of criminals.
[01:34:15.106 --> 01:34:16.246]  I've done global gaming.
[01:34:16.266 --> 01:34:19.167]  No one will be able to beat all of us.
[01:34:19.447 --> 01:34:20.507]  We're gonna take all of you.
[01:34:20.527 --> 01:34:23.488]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:34:23.508 --> 01:34:25.048]  Is global governance at last?
[01:34:25.148 --> 01:34:26.088]  Is it one world?
[01:34:26.128 --> 01:34:27.528]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:34:27.548 --> 01:34:30.749]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:34:30.849 --> 01:34:35.670]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:36.970]  Do you understand?
[01:34:37.690 --> 01:34:42.411]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:44.687 --> 01:34:48.890]  Robert Farago is here with us in studio today.
[01:34:48.970 --> 01:34:50.171]  We're really excited about that.
[01:34:50.211 --> 01:34:53.153]  He is the founder and owner of TheTruthAboutGuns.com.
[01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:58.938]  Undoubtedly the number one non-NRA.com website out there.
[01:34:59.198 --> 01:35:00.499]  So it's great to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:35:00.639 --> 01:35:01.059]  Thank you, sir.
[01:35:01.179 --> 01:35:03.821]  We're actually three times bigger than the NRA site.
[01:35:04.082 --> 01:35:05.923]  Well, I was just... I mean, they've got a whole group of sites.
[01:35:05.963 --> 01:35:09.526]  So, fine, biggest site in the... I mean, I hope it becomes the biggest site in the world, period.
[01:35:10.006 --> 01:35:11.208]  Well, after InfoWars.
[01:35:11.248 --> 01:35:12.850]  No, no, I want Drudge to say huge.
[01:35:12.930 --> 01:35:16.955]  No, seriously, because we don't win the Second Amendment fight and the First Amendment fight, we lose it all.
[01:35:16.995 --> 01:35:18.137]  They're coming after all of them right now.
[01:35:18.577 --> 01:35:20.360]  I have to agree with you on that.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.166]  So, wow, we've just seen this horrible, tragic event take place.
[01:35:25.206 --> 01:35:25.647]  You're a former
[01:35:26.247 --> 01:35:30.070]  CNN reporter and founder of The Truth About Guns.
[01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:37.955]  In February 2010, to explore the ethics, morality, business, politics, culture, technology, practice, strategy, dangers and fun of guns.
[01:35:38.976 --> 01:35:43.439]  And of course, it just goes into the fact that now it's probably the biggest gun site out there.
[01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:53.665]  In 2015, the blog conducted a recreation of the Paris Charlie Hebdo shooting to see if the defensive gun use could have been effective.
[01:35:53.685 --> 01:35:54.486]  So it's great to have you here.
[01:35:54.746 --> 01:35:55.207]  Thank you, sir.
[01:35:55.407 --> 01:35:55.867]  Nice to be here.
[01:35:56.287 --> 01:36:06.893]  So, jump right on that microphone, give us your first approximation, 48 hours later after these tragic events in Vegas, biggest gun death event of civilians in U.S.
[01:36:06.913 --> 01:36:13.617]  history, instantly being seized on by the Democrats, instantly being used to say the NRA and gun owners are terrorists.
[01:36:13.657 --> 01:36:16.238]  We'll play that clip of Oberman here in just a minute.
[01:36:16.819 --> 01:36:19.120]  I mean, it's clear they're running their full assault now.
[01:36:20.123 --> 01:36:22.305]  Well, they're just waiting for any excuse to do it.
[01:36:22.345 --> 01:36:27.748]  I'm sure Senator Chris Murphy has a drawer full of bills to restrict gun rights to Americans.
[01:36:27.949 --> 01:36:32.392]  So, they'll dance in the blood of innocents no matter what.
[01:36:32.432 --> 01:36:39.757]  Whether it's a small group, a large group, a single person, they're always exploiting death and tragedy to try and take away our gun rights.
[01:36:40.882 --> 01:36:44.966]  What I like about your side is you just get into the real culture, the numbers, the history, the facts.
[01:36:45.006 --> 01:36:55.335]  Is it safe to say the Second Amendment culture was winning, but people got a little bit complacent in the last nine months or so, and now we're seeing the major leftist counter-strike?
[01:36:56.272 --> 01:36:56.872]  Absolutely.
[01:36:58.814 --> 01:37:04.717]  With the election of Trump, a lot of people felt, you know, finally we can let our guard down and everything's going to be fine.
[01:37:04.757 --> 01:37:12.862]  And in fact, we're moving towards deregulating silencers and perhaps national reciprocity, which would be a huge win for gun culture in America.
[01:37:13.502 --> 01:37:14.843]  And then this happens.
[01:37:15.383 --> 01:37:17.264]  And obviously people are shocked.
[01:37:17.504 --> 01:37:18.545]  And so they should be.
[01:37:19.445 --> 01:37:30.973]  It is a terrible, horrific event, but once again, it has nothing to do with legal gun owners, with sane, legal, rational American gun owners who have the right to keep and bear arms.
[01:37:31.373 --> 01:37:34.815]  Which, by the way, doesn't depend on events.
[01:37:35.155 --> 01:37:36.696]  It doesn't depend on democracy.
[01:37:37.097 --> 01:37:40.158]  It's our natural, civil, and constitutionally protected rights.
[01:37:40.198 --> 01:37:45.402]  So no matter what some nutcase does, that doesn't affect my rights, or at least it shouldn't.
[01:37:45.962 --> 01:37:49.065]  And once again, we're back in the trenches fighting for our gun rights.
[01:37:49.505 --> 01:38:00.814]  It's how it's always going to be, because obviously people who want to impose a progressive agenda on America, which is basically large government, statist, want to take away our guns.
[01:38:00.854 --> 01:38:04.898]  They want to take away our gun rights, because if we're disarmed, we're easily manipulated.
[01:38:05.578 --> 01:38:08.539]  Mexico has a basic gun ban for the citizens.
[01:38:09.139 --> 01:38:09.940]  One of the strictest in the world.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:14.641]  They have one of the highest crime rates, if not the highest crime rate, because only the bad guys in government have guns.
[01:38:15.242 --> 01:38:16.902]  Chicago has a gun ban, basically.
[01:38:16.942 --> 01:38:20.043]  They have the highest crime rate in the United States, maybe the world, for a city.
[01:38:20.844 --> 01:38:22.704]  So, I mean, the facts are in.
[01:38:22.804 --> 01:38:26.046]  Gun culture has driven down crime, what, close to 60% since 1992.
[01:38:26.366 --> 01:38:28.967]  Well, you're making a practical argument.
[01:38:29.147 --> 01:38:31.588]  And once again, you don't have to make that argument.
[01:38:31.788 --> 01:38:34.769]  Each of us has an individual right to keep and bear arms.
[01:38:34.949 --> 01:38:36.609]  Yeah, why do I lose my freedoms?
[01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:38.170]  Because a nut job goes up there.
[01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:42.871]  But how could he get 40 guns in the hotel to begin with when everybody knows he was there five days?
[01:38:43.131 --> 01:38:44.691]  The hotel maids dig through everything.
[01:38:45.271 --> 01:38:48.732]  I think the total was 23 at the end of the day he had up in the hotel.
[01:38:48.892 --> 01:38:49.472]  Now they're saying 40.
[01:38:50.112 --> 01:38:50.492]  Who knows?
[01:38:50.872 --> 01:38:52.453]  Well, he put a lot of guns up there.
[01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:56.353]  By the way, it is important to know that the Mandalay Bay Hotel is a gun-free zone.
[01:38:56.514 --> 01:38:58.354]  You're not allowed to bring guns into that hotel.
[01:38:59.386 --> 01:39:00.347]  So he broke that law.
[01:39:00.447 --> 01:39:02.228]  And by the way, he broke the law against murder.
[01:39:02.448 --> 01:39:13.234]  So people who are willing to commit mass murder, willing to commit crimes with guns, with bombs, with other methods, cars, they're not going to be stopped by laws, obviously.
[01:39:13.374 --> 01:39:16.415]  And we're on over 200 plus stations, so there's a lot of new listeners tuning in.
[01:39:16.435 --> 01:39:18.536]  But I think talk radio understands those facts.
[01:39:18.917 --> 01:39:21.278]  You lay it all out at thetruthaboutguns.com.
[01:39:24.019 --> 01:39:24.520]  They're coming.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.140]  They're confident.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.721]  They think that they're getting our firearms.
[01:39:28.782 --> 01:39:32.624]  And notice the left was calling for all this violence, calling for an uprising in October.
[01:39:32.644 --> 01:39:34.725]  And they keep saying they don't have a motive.
[01:39:35.005 --> 01:39:37.307]  He attacked a country music venue.
[01:39:37.727 --> 01:39:39.748]  I mean, I think the motive right there is clear.
[01:39:39.768 --> 01:39:44.070]  If this was a white guy attacking a hip-hop concert, they'd say he didn't like black people.
[01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:45.231]  He was a white supremacist.
[01:39:45.251 --> 01:39:47.112]  I mean, right there, you've got massive motive.
[01:39:47.412 --> 01:39:49.856]  Well, there are a lot of theories about what his motives are.
[01:39:49.916 --> 01:39:52.439]  We certainly know that he had enormous gambling debts.
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:56.144]  He may have been mad at the facility and wanted to make them pay.
[01:39:56.365 --> 01:39:56.565]  Right.
[01:39:56.605 --> 01:39:59.669]  He had made 16 bets over $10,000 in the last two weeks, which came out earlier.
[01:40:03.454 --> 01:40:05.036]  So he may have been a scorned gambler?
[01:40:05.496 --> 01:40:07.598]  Well, as you know, gambling is an addiction.
[01:40:07.818 --> 01:40:11.702]  And if you remove what the addict wants, that makes them kind of crazy.
[01:40:11.982 --> 01:40:13.264]  There are only two ways to look at that.
[01:40:13.304 --> 01:40:18.929]  Maybe he thought, I'll go out and blow all my money, because then I'm going to go shoot everybody and die.
[01:40:19.369 --> 01:40:21.131]  Or he was motivated by that.
[01:40:21.191 --> 01:40:22.472]  He was angry at the casino.
[01:40:22.512 --> 01:40:25.375]  You know, they didn't give me, I've spent millions of dollars.
[01:40:25.475 --> 01:40:29.637]  That's one of the only theories, other than Islamists' leftist Antifa, that makes sense.
[01:40:30.137 --> 01:40:34.759]  Because, look, $100,000 in Philippines, that's Islamic.
[01:40:34.799 --> 01:40:37.740]  They've just had Islamic takeovers of major towns and cities.
[01:40:38.361 --> 01:40:41.082]  I mean, I've got, listen, I have sources in the hostage rescue team.
[01:40:41.502 --> 01:40:47.685]  And they say that A, he fought back and they killed him, and that B, there was Antifa and Islamists' literature everywhere.
[01:40:48.025 --> 01:40:50.146]  I was told that in the morning.
[01:40:50.506 --> 01:40:52.327]  Later it came out, she'd been to the Middle East.
[01:40:52.407 --> 01:40:54.028]  I mean, so I was told stuff before it was in the news.
[01:40:54.608 --> 01:40:55.388]  Well, I haven't heard that.
[01:40:55.548 --> 01:40:56.569]  I haven't heard that information.
[01:40:57.589 --> 01:41:00.311]  That's pretty distressing information.
[01:41:01.091 --> 01:41:01.491]  There it is.
[01:41:01.511 --> 01:41:02.952]  That's just part of it.
[01:41:02.972 --> 01:41:05.113]  Guys, will you print him the Kit Daniels article?
[01:41:05.173 --> 01:41:07.014]  The article he wants the first one linked there?
[01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:07.394]  Right.
[01:41:10.054 --> 01:41:15.657]  Well, apparently his girlfriend had some connection with family in the Philippines, so that may have explained the $100,000 as well.
[01:41:15.717 --> 01:41:15.937]  Yeah.
[01:41:16.177 --> 01:41:18.038]  Oh, I'm not saying it's open and shut.
[01:41:18.118 --> 01:41:21.000]  All I know is, first, ISIS takes responsibility.
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:22.560]  Generally, they're accurate when they do it.
[01:41:22.621 --> 01:41:23.261]  AP said that.
[01:41:23.561 --> 01:41:25.722]  Then later, oh, they're just doing it because they're desperate.
[01:41:25.922 --> 01:41:28.123]  And then later they said Alex Jones made it up.
[01:41:29.224 --> 01:41:30.845]  They never made the claim.
[01:41:31.892 --> 01:41:34.234]  Well Alex, it's early days.
[01:41:34.355 --> 01:41:37.338]  We don't know exactly what motivated this nutcase.
[01:41:38.399 --> 01:41:44.625]  We do know that the progressives are using this to attack our gun rights regardless.
[01:41:44.985 --> 01:41:49.029]  It's kind of funny how it's taken so long to figure out whether he was a Democrat or Republican.
[01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:52.413]  I think in other situations it's been pretty fast.
[01:41:53.193 --> 01:41:55.015]  Or whether indeed he was an NRA member.
[01:41:55.977 --> 01:42:02.935]  The thing is, we shouldn't rush to judgment on this, but we are alone in that because the other side of the equation has certainly rushed to judgment.
[01:42:03.295 --> 01:42:03.757]  Exactly!
[01:42:03.817 --> 01:42:04.398]  So what do we do?
[01:42:05.356 --> 01:42:06.677]  Well, we do what we've always done.
[01:42:07.037 --> 01:42:07.518]  We fight.
[01:42:07.918 --> 01:42:09.139]  We fight for our rights.
[01:42:09.619 --> 01:42:12.141]  Politically, we fight for our rights in the culture.
[01:42:12.501 --> 01:42:14.603]  And remember, gun culture is winning.
[01:42:14.763 --> 01:42:16.925]  We are ahead of the game at the moment.
[01:42:16.945 --> 01:42:17.225]  We are.
[01:42:17.645 --> 01:42:19.907]  So, you know, we just gotta keep going.
[01:42:20.407 --> 01:42:21.668]  It means... And then this happens, though.
[01:42:21.768 --> 01:42:30.174]  I mean, right when the left's calling for the revolution, and then a country music venue gets blasted, we have to look at the prime suspect being an Islamicist or an antifa.
[01:42:30.254 --> 01:42:30.875]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:42:31.135 --> 01:42:35.198]  Well, you can look at that, Alex, but until we see proof, I'm not prepared to reach that conclusion.
[01:42:35.598 --> 01:42:37.359]  I mean, look, all things are possible.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:47.427]  Obviously, ISIS is a deeply evil organization and uses people and sometimes- By the way, I agree with you, but Hillary Clinton yesterday morning said it was gun owners' fault.
[01:42:47.787 --> 01:42:50.689]  Now they're saying we're all collectively to blame, so I blame Hillary.
[01:42:50.809 --> 01:42:52.010]  I say she did it.
[01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:53.751]  I say she paid him.
[01:42:53.911 --> 01:42:59.115]  I don't agree with that, but hypothetically, for the case of argument, if she's going to do that, then no, Hillary, you did it.
[01:42:59.215 --> 01:43:00.456]  You financed the whole thing.
[01:43:01.603 --> 01:43:11.432]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:43:11.492 --> 01:43:11.972]  That's right.
[01:43:12.032 --> 01:43:17.036]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[01:43:17.296 --> 01:43:23.722]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[01:43:23.962 --> 01:43:31.272]  And let me tell you, son, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:43:31.553 --> 01:43:31.753]  Woo!
[01:43:31.793 --> 01:43:32.714]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:43:32.834 --> 01:43:39.524]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[01:43:39.684 --> 01:43:41.425]  There is no comparison.
[01:43:41.565 --> 01:43:50.790]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:43:51.150 --> 01:43:54.472]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:43:54.592 --> 01:43:58.574]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:43:58.714 --> 01:43:59.575]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:45:05.123 --> 01:45:14.349]  I want to hire a bunch of people, because I'm all in this year, spending everything on expansion, adding those shows, adding more broadcasters, adding more camera crews.
[01:45:14.369 --> 01:45:17.312]  We're going to send a crew into Puerto Rico.
[01:45:17.352 --> 01:45:18.873]  We need some attention on that.
[01:45:19.553 --> 01:45:20.254]  Still no power.
[01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:21.515]  I mean, it's dire.
[01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:24.617]  So it takes a lot of money to fund all this, obviously.
[01:45:25.097 --> 01:45:25.698]  So please,

[01:45:45.527 --> 01:45:47.970]  We've also got them that, you know, just say Molon Labe.
[01:45:48.570 --> 01:45:51.972]  And the little communists won't know what that is because they're so stupid and won't stab you in the back.
[01:45:52.532 --> 01:45:55.294]  But they really are trying to intimidate everybody right now in this submission.
[01:45:55.574 --> 01:45:57.095]  We've got CNN's fake news shirts.
[01:45:57.455 --> 01:46:00.997]  We have the new Dayglo, Hunters, Infowars.com hats.

[01:47:00.622 --> 01:47:02.203]  We need your help.
[01:47:06.946 --> 01:47:09.667]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.933 --> 01:47:21.975]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:21.995 --> 01:47:23.816]  You're gonna be riding shotgun with us.
[01:47:23.836 --> 01:47:24.956]  We need to get you an earpiece.
[01:47:25.617 --> 01:47:27.778]  We already have one coming up in the next segment.
[01:47:34.901 --> 01:47:35.622]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:47:35.702 --> 01:47:36.262]  I'm your host.
[01:47:36.863 --> 01:47:38.924]  Infowars.com is the website.
[01:47:39.565 --> 01:47:41.766]  Newswars.com is our news site.
[01:47:42.227 --> 01:47:43.988]  PrisonPlanet.com is our backup site.
[01:47:44.008 --> 01:47:47.391]  We're going to talk about the biggest gun site out there.
[01:47:47.911 --> 01:47:49.412]  Robert Farago is our guest.
[01:47:49.432 --> 01:47:51.054]  TheTruthAboutGuns.com.
[01:47:51.074 --> 01:47:54.737]  And I didn't know he was in Austinite, because I'm on his site every week.
[01:47:54.797 --> 01:47:57.439]  We link to his huge website all the time.
[01:47:57.899 --> 01:47:59.781]  And then I saw him at a gun range this weekend.
[01:48:00.854 --> 01:48:06.175]  And he's lost so much weight, something I wish I'd do again, and I was like, yeah.
[01:48:06.595 --> 01:48:08.076]  He was like, yeah, I own Truth About Guns.
[01:48:08.096 --> 01:48:11.457]  I was like, yeah, you look like the guy, but you're a lot smaller now.
[01:48:11.737 --> 01:48:12.877]  So congratulations on that.
[01:48:13.017 --> 01:48:13.257]  Thank you.
[01:48:13.277 --> 01:48:14.598]  I'm half the man I used to be.
[01:48:15.138 --> 01:48:20.559]  Well, I mean, I'm still about a third of the man I was, but then I've kind of crept back because I've gotten so lazy with all the supplements I take.
[01:48:20.579 --> 01:48:24.060]  They help me lose weight, but then actually when I stop working out, still it doesn't work, so.
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:26.181]  Okay, well, you should try some of the supplements you sell.
[01:48:26.201 --> 01:48:27.642]  Some of them are very effective, I'm sure.
[01:48:27.883 --> 01:48:28.863]  Well, they are, actually.
[01:48:29.764 --> 01:48:34.167]  People are deficient in things like iodine was the biggest thing.
[01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:41.693]  I mean, just with that, with the workouts I was doing like four or five years ago, I lost 30 pounds doing the same workouts just because I was iodine deficient.
[01:48:42.273 --> 01:48:43.014]  And then the other things.
[01:48:43.054 --> 01:48:47.217]  And then the problem is, I just got to where again the last year, I have a new baby and stuff.
[01:48:47.638 --> 01:48:48.398]  Oh, congratulations!
[01:48:48.418 --> 01:48:48.719]  Thank you.
[01:48:48.819 --> 01:48:50.200]  I just quit working out.
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.442]  But I've been doing it again at least twice a week.
[01:48:52.462 --> 01:48:55.064]  I used to work out four or five days a week, so I'm doing it.
[01:48:55.084 --> 01:48:55.304]  Good.
[01:48:55.345 --> 01:48:56.826]  Well, I'm glad you're back on the wagon there.
[01:48:57.146 --> 01:48:57.887]  Enough about me.
[01:48:58.607 --> 01:49:02.211]  You're going to ride shotgun on the summit of the next hour with some other guests we've got joining us.
[01:49:02.231 --> 01:49:04.973]  But truth about guns, you're looking at this.
[01:49:05.033 --> 01:49:06.855]  What does your gut tell you as a former
[01:49:07.355 --> 01:49:10.937]  You know, CNN, Newsman, the whole nine yards.
[01:49:11.317 --> 01:49:18.982]  What was your process of deciding to kind of get out of that system, of course CNN was a lot better ten years ago, and then actually get into the opposition?
[01:49:19.793 --> 01:49:21.954]  Well, CNN wasn't that much better ten years ago.
[01:49:22.274 --> 01:49:23.354]  In my opinion, it was.
[01:49:23.394 --> 01:49:26.295]  I mean, it was bad, but, man, they'll lie now, like, constantly.
[01:49:26.315 --> 01:49:27.116]  Well, you were behind the scenes.
[01:49:27.316 --> 01:49:27.896]  Tell me how I'm wrong.
[01:49:27.936 --> 01:49:28.276]  I believe you.
[01:49:28.516 --> 01:49:29.556]  Well, it's true.
[01:49:30.177 --> 01:49:33.478]  There is a cultural mindset there that's political.
[01:49:33.718 --> 01:49:38.720]  They all come from the same background, the same schools, the same urban environments.
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:39.240]  Echo Chamber.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.282]  Yeah, none of them know how to shoot a gun, for example.
[01:49:42.302 --> 01:49:50.389]  There are very few people who know anything about firearms there, and they're just disconnected from the reality that you and I are aware of.
[01:49:50.469 --> 01:49:53.692]  The conservative mindset is just not there.
[01:49:53.732 --> 01:49:55.053]  There's nobody there representing it.
[01:49:55.453 --> 01:50:02.799]  So people make decisions which are, you and I would say, whoa, hold on a second, that's not fair.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:07.123]  But nobody's there to tell them that it isn't, and they just all
[01:50:07.483 --> 01:50:11.308]  Have that cultural bias towards the progressive or liberal mindset.
[01:50:12.369 --> 01:50:12.910]  That's it.
[01:50:13.150 --> 01:50:19.819]  I mean at the top they're elites with bodyguards and they want to disarm the public because they want control and that's in their own WikiLeaks and documents.
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:23.564]  But down low if you take out leftists like I went out a few times with
[01:50:24.645 --> 01:50:25.025]  I don't
[01:50:43.732 --> 01:50:51.959]  Women shooting bullseye at 200 yards, flipping out, wanting one, and everybody having a great time, and converting that, I'm not bad, why can't I have one?
[01:50:52.319 --> 01:51:08.653]  So it's all about rugged individualism, it's about skinning a buck, running a trot line, but the liberals, they live in these high-rise buildings, they don't know how to change a tire, they are domesticated, and I think that's really the process of guns, is bringing people back out of that, back into being a real person.
[01:51:09.113 --> 01:51:09.714]  Absolutely.
[01:51:09.894 --> 01:51:13.998]  I mean, guns are fun, for one thing, and that's something people should understand and recognize.
[01:51:14.779 --> 01:51:16.620]  And they don't pick themselves up and shoot people.
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:23.347]  That's one of the things that a lot of people who've never touched a gun don't understand, is that that thing over there is not dangerous.
[01:51:23.407 --> 01:51:26.670]  It's the person who is holding it, or not, hopefully, in that case.
[01:51:27.091 --> 01:51:30.474]  But yes, the best way to convert people to the cause of
[01:51:30.854 --> 01:51:34.457]  of the Second Amendment is to take them out and show them what guns can and cannot do.
[01:51:34.817 --> 01:51:36.318]  Because they have never touched one.
[01:51:36.338 --> 01:51:37.939]  They have never shot one.
[01:51:37.959 --> 01:51:55.793]  They don't understand what it can and cannot do, so they buy all the propaganda that it's evil and that it's... that people who have these impulses, right, that are... the average person is a good person, but give them a gun and they have an anger attack, they're going to shoot someone.
[01:51:55.853 --> 01:51:57.254]  Which is completely false.
[01:51:58.335 --> 01:52:05.899]  Almost every case they're on serotonin reuptake inhibitors and even the insert says this can make you go megalomaniac and kill people.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:10.482]  Well there are a lot of reasons why people flip out but most people don't.
[01:52:11.103 --> 01:52:19.228]  Americans are law-abiding peaceful people and we have these guns because we have the right to protect ourselves in a peaceful manner.
[01:52:19.608 --> 01:52:21.729]  We have the right to keep and bear arms.
[01:52:21.869 --> 01:52:24.870]  How we use those guns is subject to laws and regulations.
[01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:27.271]  We can't brandish them and threaten people with them.
[01:52:27.331 --> 01:52:33.494]  We can't use them to shoot people who are not posing an imminent, credible threat of death or grievous bodily harm.
[01:52:33.934 --> 01:52:35.454]  We are a civilized people.
[01:52:35.835 --> 01:52:43.178]  And when somebody does something uncivilized, like the Las Vegas shooter, it doesn't reflect on us as law-abiding gun owners.
[01:52:43.218 --> 01:52:44.078]  At least it shouldn't.
[01:52:44.418 --> 01:52:47.660]  Exactly, but they're trying to say, Keith Olbermann, let's play that clip in a moment.
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:50.662]  Keith Olbermann, NRA should be branded a terrorist organization.
[01:52:50.962 --> 01:52:52.663]  He's saying gun owners are terrorists.
[01:52:53.004 --> 01:52:54.265]  He's saying we're guilty.
[01:52:54.345 --> 01:53:00.689]  Well, back in World War II, if the Nazis were in Poland and somebody shot an SS officer, they'd kill the whole street.
[01:53:01.309 --> 01:53:09.316]  Or in the Soviet Union, if somebody killed a member of the GRU, they'd kill maybe half the town, if it was a small town, or send them to re-education camps or gulags.
[01:53:09.676 --> 01:53:16.762]  This idea that because somebody else did something, I'm at fault, meanwhile, being killed in a mass shooting is one of the rarest forms of death.
[01:53:17.042 --> 01:53:24.789]  But it creates the perception, just like Great White Shark Attack, is like six, seven people a year die from it, people still are scared that great whites are going to eat them.
[01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:29.896]  Alex, you make a really good point, and that is that we're not seeing the big picture when we look at guns.
[01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:40.870]  A lot of people say, well, you know, society would be better off if we had this gun control law or that gun control law, which is patently untrue, but they make that argument that it's for social utility to make society better.
[01:53:41.551 --> 01:53:43.653]  I'm the son of a Holocaust survivor.
[01:53:44.234 --> 01:53:46.836]  I understand what government can do.
[01:53:47.197 --> 01:53:51.361]  Government is the greatest threat to personal liberty, to our very lives.
[01:53:51.721 --> 01:53:55.925]  We have the Second Amendment not to protect ourselves from criminals or to go hunting.
[01:53:56.185 --> 01:53:58.408]  We have it to protect ourselves from the government.
[01:53:58.888 --> 01:54:02.412]  I don't trust any government and I don't trust the United States government.
[01:54:03.072 --> 01:54:05.934]  Our firearms protect us from our own government.
[01:54:05.954 --> 01:54:08.916]  And people have to understand and embrace that fact.
[01:54:09.257 --> 01:54:12.119]  It's not about protecting yourself from criminals.
[01:54:12.519 --> 01:54:16.222]  Because the greatest criminals in history have always been government.
[01:54:16.662 --> 01:54:18.764]  And we're not having mass slaughter.
[01:54:18.784 --> 01:54:21.025]  I mean, okay, so you had 500 people shot.
[01:54:21.146 --> 01:54:22.046]  That's horrible.
[01:54:22.326 --> 01:54:22.787]  Terrible.
[01:54:23.147 --> 01:54:26.710]  But look how many people are murdered in Mexico right next door.
[01:54:27.190 --> 01:54:28.872]  Tens of thousands.
[01:54:29.012 --> 01:54:30.974]  It's 120,000 we know of in the last decade.
[01:54:31.254 --> 01:54:35.218]  Look at the slaughter that goes on in countries in Africa or around the world.
[01:54:35.238 --> 01:54:35.959]  Millions.
[01:54:36.199 --> 01:54:39.082]  Look at the genocides we've had throughout history.
[01:54:39.102 --> 01:54:42.886]  Look at the latest Islamic waves in the Middle East killing over a million people.
[01:54:43.907 --> 01:54:47.471]  And slaughtering Christians, unarmed, disarmed people.
[01:54:47.831 --> 01:54:50.734]  We cannot allow ourselves to be disarmed.
[01:54:51.034 --> 01:54:58.883]  Because if we are, we will be at the mercy of the greatest threat to our liberty, which is not some nutcase at the top of a hotel on the 32nd floor.
[01:54:59.323 --> 01:55:00.825]  It's the government itself.
[01:55:00.885 --> 01:55:01.345]  That's right.
[01:55:01.405 --> 01:55:03.427]  And so the Second Amendment is about a balance of power.
[01:55:04.088 --> 01:55:06.290]  And yes, it's messy sometimes, and it's sad.
[01:55:06.810 --> 01:55:08.031]  And believe me, I've got children.
[01:55:08.532 --> 01:55:12.856]  I mean, the point is, I still let them get in the car, even though more die every day in cars in the U.S.
[01:55:12.876 --> 01:55:14.017]  than died by this mass shooting.
[01:55:14.417 --> 01:55:16.899]  The truth is, more guns mean less crime.
[01:55:17.019 --> 01:55:18.020]  All the statistics are there.
[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:21.103]  And the left is losing that battle, so that's why they're panicking.
[01:55:21.123 --> 01:55:22.744]  But that's powerful testimony.
[01:55:22.784 --> 01:55:23.685]  I mean, look at Nazi Germany.
[01:55:24.125 --> 01:55:25.986]  First thing they did was take the general public's gun.
[01:55:26.407 --> 01:55:28.488]  Soviet system, any authoritarian system.
[01:55:28.968 --> 01:55:37.334]  The UN says in their world treaty on guns that they want us to pass and ratify that civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:55:37.814 --> 01:55:40.797]  They're saying a power monopoly of the state is legitimate.
[01:55:41.197 --> 01:55:42.438]  No, it's called tyranny.
[01:55:43.158 --> 01:55:44.279]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:55:44.319 --> 01:55:47.082]  My family history is testimony to that.
[01:55:47.643 --> 01:55:52.808]  I grew up with a Japanese-American whose parents were interned during World War II.
[01:55:53.428 --> 01:55:54.209]  These things happen.
[01:55:54.249 --> 01:55:55.911]  And by the way, I just want to point something out.
[01:55:56.271 --> 01:55:59.034]  This is not the worst mass shooting in U.S.
[01:55:59.054 --> 01:55:59.434]  history.
[01:55:59.695 --> 01:56:01.096]  The worst mass shooting in U.S.
[01:56:01.116 --> 01:56:02.437]  history was at Wounded Knee.
[01:56:03.078 --> 01:56:04.499]  We're 150 to... You know what?
[01:56:04.539 --> 01:56:04.999]  You're right!
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:06.821]  We gotta get an article out on that.
[01:56:07.041 --> 01:56:09.042]  That was 150, right?
[01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:12.044]  150 to 300 Native Americans were slaughtered by government troops.
[01:56:12.064 --> 01:56:14.286]  And you know what those government troops were there to do?
[01:56:14.486 --> 01:56:14.926]  Disarm them.
[01:56:15.206 --> 01:56:16.747]  Disarm the Lakota people.
[01:56:16.927 --> 01:56:18.008]  Man, we gotta get you on all the time.
[01:56:18.048 --> 01:56:19.029]  I know you're a busy guy doing like...
[01:56:19.329 --> 01:56:21.750]  Other bunches, interviews already, CBS, you name it.
[01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:23.972]  But man, I didn't even know you were in Austin.
[01:56:23.992 --> 01:56:25.913]  People always see me and go, I didn't know you were in Austin, Alex.
[01:56:26.193 --> 01:56:28.834]  I've got to like look at all these people I love watching and listening to that they're in Austin.
[01:56:29.034 --> 01:56:34.637]  Let's put on screen TheTruthAboutGuns.com because that's my next subject when we come back in just a minute with you.
[01:56:35.077 --> 01:56:39.500]  I want to ask you again, the owner and founder of TheTruthAboutGuns.com, Robert Farago.
[01:56:40.970 --> 01:56:42.031]  What about the First Amendment?
[01:56:42.131 --> 01:56:46.513]  The left now says they want a Ministry of Truth to shut down conservative libertarians.
[01:56:46.753 --> 01:56:51.455]  They claim we're all funded by Russians, which is like saying we're funded by Chinese Easter bunnies from the moon.
[01:56:51.475 --> 01:56:55.397]  And they say they want to shut us down because they can't win the debate.
[01:56:55.437 --> 01:56:56.137]  But that's true!
[01:56:56.498 --> 01:56:58.759]  Biggest gun massacre in U.S.
[01:56:58.779 --> 01:56:59.559]  history is Wounded Knee.
[01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:00.820]  We gotta get that out right now!
[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:01.340]  Wow!
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:04.842]  It's important for people to realize where the real danger lies.
[01:57:05.967 --> 01:57:10.757]  You know, I used to think Second Amendment was key, because it defends all the others, but isn't the first just as important?
[01:57:11.098 --> 01:57:16.809]  And the fact that they admit they want to go after that, and say we don't deserve that speech, and they want to take away the President's Twitter!
[01:57:19.591 --> 01:57:25.818]  Well, you know, there are people who do not like the idea of individuals having liberty.
[01:57:26.058 --> 01:57:26.799]  They just don't like it.
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:30.944]  And they're willing to do whatever it takes to make a progressive case.
[01:57:31.144 --> 01:57:32.946]  We're glad everybody gets to learn the second amendment.
[01:57:32.966 --> 01:57:34.067]  Hopefully they love freedom in this country.
[01:57:34.087 --> 01:57:40.654]  But was there not four truckloads of women in hijabs at the shooting range when I met you Sunday?
[01:57:41.235 --> 01:57:43.340]  There were, I think there were about five of them there.
[01:57:43.881 --> 01:57:45.384]  No, no, but there was four loads, we learned.
[01:57:45.464 --> 01:57:45.885]  Oh, were there?
[01:57:46.246 --> 01:57:47.288]  Yeah, I talked to the staff.
[01:57:47.409 --> 01:57:48.050]  Well, I'm glad.
[01:57:48.090 --> 01:57:49.934]  If they're Americans, I hope they're exercising.
[01:57:50.034 --> 01:57:51.297]  I mean, it's just women with the jibs, like...
[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:54.681]  Before I go any further, we need your financial support.
[01:57:54.821 --> 01:58:04.127]  I want to hire a bunch of people, because I'm all in this year, spending everything on expansion, adding those shows, adding more broadcasters, adding more camera crews.
[01:58:04.167 --> 01:58:08.570]  We're going to send a crew into Puerto Rico to get some attention on that.
[01:58:09.250 --> 01:58:09.951]  Still no power.
[01:58:10.391 --> 01:58:11.191]  I mean, it's dire.
[01:58:11.712 --> 01:58:14.293]  So it takes a lot of money to fund all this, obviously.
[01:58:14.793 --> 01:58:15.394]  So please,
[01:58:17.222 --> 01:58:19.325]  Buy a lot of products from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:19.425 --> 01:58:21.707]  They're game-changing supplements and nutraceuticals.

[01:58:26.533 --> 01:58:28.014]  But we got Molon Labe shirts.
[01:58:28.175 --> 01:58:29.236]  You know, so much more.
[01:58:29.296 --> 01:58:33.621]  If you want to make a stand for free speech and wear a Trump's My President shirt, then that's great.
[01:58:33.961 --> 01:58:35.203]  Or an InfoWars.com shirt.
[01:58:35.223 --> 01:58:37.666]  We've also got them that, you know, just say Molon Labe.
[01:58:38.266 --> 01:58:41.673]  And the little communist won't know what that is because you're so stupid and won't stab you in the back.
[01:58:42.214 --> 01:58:44.999]  But they really are trying to intimidate everybody right now in this submission.
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:46.802]  We've got CNN's fake news shirts.
[01:58:47.163 --> 01:58:50.710]  We have the new Dayglo, Hunters, Infowars.com hats.
[01:58:51.707 --> 01:58:52.607]  From Richardson.
[01:58:52.848 --> 01:58:54.288]  Best quality out there, in my view.
[01:58:54.808 --> 01:58:55.649]  Everybody loves the hats.
[01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:57.429]  We've got the InfoWars.com hats.
[01:58:57.810 --> 01:58:59.130]  Also with the snake.

[01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:51.861]  We need your help.
[01:59:54.503 --> 01:59:58.606]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.147 --> 02:00:00.408]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.945 --> 02:00:21.149]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:21.630 --> 02:00:26.759]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:28.579 --> 02:00:32.880]  Robert Barrago is our guest, the founder of the biggest gun site out there, WhoIsAboutGuns.com.
[02:00:33.341 --> 02:00:34.441]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:34.741 --> 02:00:37.222]  He's going to co-host with us a little bit more into the hour.
[02:00:37.622 --> 02:00:38.762]  Michael Schneider joins us.
[02:00:39.783 --> 02:00:42.243]  We also have Laura Loomer joining us.
[02:00:43.184 --> 02:00:46.325]  She's done a lot of research about Islamic connections to this guy and more.
[02:00:46.885 --> 02:00:52.727]  I mean, we know that they've swept the ISIS-taking credit under the rug, and they just said, I made that up.
[02:00:52.767 --> 02:00:53.507]  That's fake news.
[02:00:54.187 --> 02:00:55.068]  Okay, when they say that.
[02:00:55.549 --> 02:00:56.530]  But we don't know what happened.
[02:00:56.570 --> 02:01:00.174]  And listen, I'm glad to see Muslims that want to live free come to America.
[02:01:00.234 --> 02:01:00.835]  I've said that.
[02:01:01.716 --> 02:01:14.751]  But at the same time, when you see Europe, 80% military age men being brought in, this whole force deal, the non-vetting, and we've just seen the left, Obama and Hillary and others back the Arab Spring, that's when I get concerned.
[02:01:15.543 --> 02:01:21.566]  Well, one can be concerned, but I wasn't concerned by seeing the Muslim ladies, mostly ladies, shooting at the range.
[02:01:22.007 --> 02:01:24.308]  All Americans have a right to keep and bear arms.
[02:01:24.888 --> 02:01:36.595]  I'm just saying it was surreal, and I was respectful so I didn't videotape it, but then we found out from people there, there had been two loads before, I saw that one load, getting the whole range, and then another load.
[02:01:37.095 --> 02:01:37.716]  Four loads.
[02:01:38.216 --> 02:01:40.097]  One guy training like 15, 16 women.
[02:01:41.818 --> 02:01:45.500]  And all having a great time, all being completely respectful to the ranger.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:46.581]  They were very nice ladies.
[02:01:46.901 --> 02:01:50.983]  And I'm glad to see the more Americans who keep and bear arms to save for our rights are.
[02:01:51.023 --> 02:01:55.525]  Doesn't matter whether they're white, black, Muslim, Jewish, Quaker.
[02:01:56.046 --> 02:01:57.506]  I totally agree with you.
[02:01:57.767 --> 02:02:01.008]  I'm just saying in many of those countries, women aren't allowed to shoot guns.
[02:02:01.449 --> 02:02:03.169]  Well, that's why America's great, isn't it?
[02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:04.150]  Exactly!
[02:02:04.710 --> 02:02:07.592]  So, why do you think the feminists are endorsing radical Islam?
[02:02:09.989 --> 02:02:13.912]  Because they're progressive statists who don't believe in personal liberty?
[02:02:14.893 --> 02:02:15.273]  Exactly.
[02:02:15.313 --> 02:02:16.033]  So they team up.
[02:02:16.254 --> 02:02:18.875]  They like the authoritarianism of radical Islam.
[02:02:18.976 --> 02:02:19.756]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:20.156 --> 02:02:21.638]  Well, I mean, they're all of the same.
[02:02:21.658 --> 02:02:26.641]  You go far enough in that direction, you have all these people who want to do something.
[02:02:26.861 --> 02:02:30.744]  The core belief is that they know better than you do what's for you.
[02:02:31.045 --> 02:02:31.785]  And they're elitists.
[02:02:32.105 --> 02:02:34.347]  And that's not how America should be.
[02:02:34.387 --> 02:02:36.489]  And that's not the kind of people we want to have in charge.
[02:02:36.909 --> 02:02:38.170]  But there are loads of them.
[02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:40.531]  And I think, you know, Alex, I've got to give you credit.
[02:02:41.071 --> 02:02:51.434]  Your website, your program, our website, which is, I don't know, seven years old, we've now been able to get our messages out to people who couldn't get them before.
[02:02:51.454 --> 02:02:53.415]  Remember, I was on the inside at CNN.
[02:02:53.795 --> 02:03:01.337]  I understand how the gatekeepers have destroyed, used to control the information so that people couldn't get the truth.
[02:03:01.737 --> 02:03:03.258]  So I'm delighted
[02:03:03.658 --> 02:03:09.002]  That we have now a way to counter the... Well, let me congratulate you, the audience, everybody.
[02:03:09.342 --> 02:03:10.443]  We just want free choice.
[02:03:10.463 --> 02:03:11.504]  It doesn't mean we have all the answers.
[02:03:11.524 --> 02:03:13.145]  We're not up here saying we know exactly what happened.
[02:03:13.465 --> 02:03:18.909]  We're just simply looking at every angle so that fake news, corporate news, misrepresents what we say and what we do.
[02:03:19.209 --> 02:03:21.611]  But people have seen that trick so many times, it doesn't work anymore.
[02:03:22.441 --> 02:03:28.424]  I think people are becoming more cynical, and so they should be, because there is a lot of misinformation being spread.
[02:03:28.784 --> 02:03:30.745]  But it's more than that, though.
[02:03:30.765 --> 02:03:38.968]  I think what's happened recently, which really bothers me, is that there's a lot of hatred coming from the left, a lot of unmitigated hatred, disgust.
[02:03:39.008 --> 02:03:40.129]  They're getting radicalized.
[02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:41.529]  I think that's true.
[02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:45.930]  I was listening to MSNBC, I listened to all the different channels to try and get the perspective.
[02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:54.332]  And just the constant bashing of Donald Trump, who deserves some bashing, but they just, they try and tear him to pieces.
[02:03:54.352 --> 02:03:54.632]  Frothing!
[02:03:55.372 --> 02:03:56.472]  They are frothing at the mouth.
[02:03:56.912 --> 02:04:06.074]  And when they talk about guns, it is obviously something that they're going to rally around because you can't have old fat white guys who are redneck extremists.
[02:04:06.774 --> 02:04:07.996]  Racists having guns.
[02:04:08.556 --> 02:04:11.819]  And they're absolutely wrong about characterizing us as having guns.
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:14.162]  But they do know who their enemy is, really.
[02:04:14.202 --> 02:04:17.305]  And their enemy are people who embrace individual liberty.
[02:04:17.605 --> 02:04:19.327]  They're collectivists.
[02:04:19.427 --> 02:04:20.388]  They're domesticators.
[02:04:20.889 --> 02:04:23.011]  They really want domesticated, helpless people.
[02:04:23.291 --> 02:04:23.751]  Well, they do.
[02:04:23.952 --> 02:04:25.273]  Because they're easier to manipulate.
[02:04:25.293 --> 02:04:26.273]  And it's for our own good, though.
[02:04:26.293 --> 02:04:27.494]  You have to understand that, Alex.
[02:04:27.615 --> 02:04:31.057]  It's not because they want to get pleasure out of this.
[02:04:31.097 --> 02:04:36.942]  They're doing this to lift people up and to make... The left wants domesticated, defenseless slaves.
[02:04:37.743 --> 02:04:39.824]  TheTruthAboutGuns.com.
[02:04:40.045 --> 02:04:41.326]  That's the name of the last 30 minutes.

[02:04:42.827 --> 02:04:45.769]  The left wants defenseless, domesticated slaves.
[02:04:46.089 --> 02:04:46.810]  Exclamation point.

[02:04:49.372 --> 02:04:49.893]  We'll be back.
[02:04:49.933 --> 02:04:50.875]  More co-hosting with me.
[02:04:50.895 --> 02:04:51.977]  Man, I gotta get you in here more.
[02:04:52.137 --> 02:04:52.478]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:52.498 --> 02:04:53.459]  It's crazy running into you.
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:53.860]  Wow.
[02:04:54.321 --> 02:04:55.343]  What a small world.
[02:04:55.403 --> 02:05:01.954]  I mean, there's always a jib, but then with full auto, blasting, and then Robert Farago's right there, and I'm like, what is going on here?

[02:06:16.607 --> 02:06:21.029]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:21.489 --> 02:06:30.373]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:06:44.890 --> 02:06:52.105]  In the UK, for the seventh year in a row, they've introduced legislation in Parliament to make you get a license for a butcher knife.
[02:06:54.431 --> 02:06:57.172]  And of course the jihadis, you have acid attacks almost every day.
[02:06:57.192 --> 02:07:06.855]  When somebody runs over somebody with a car, they are not blaming the car and saying other people driving cars are being insensitive.
[02:07:07.195 --> 02:07:12.316]  But they are saying people that are shooting guns now and putting videos out are insensitive.
[02:07:12.336 --> 02:07:19.318]  In fact, I'd asked Zimmerman before he left to go to Puerto Rico and cover that and also cover some gun stuff in Georgia.
[02:07:19.698 --> 02:07:21.579]  Did he give you guys videos in the folder?
[02:07:22.679 --> 02:07:31.040]  I forgot to ask, or call them before their plane takes off right now, because I want to be able to show myself shooting the other day and point out this is not insensitive when I'm doing that.
[02:07:31.601 --> 02:07:42.942]  Robert Farago is our guest, the owner and founder of TheTruthAboutGuns.com, a former CNN, I guess, producer and camera operator and more, decided to leave and now has the biggest gun site in the world.
[02:07:43.423 --> 02:07:51.784]  California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, gun lobbyist and pro-gun politicians were in the room with Las Vegas spree killer.
[02:07:52.304 --> 02:07:52.944]  What is that?
[02:07:53.305 --> 02:08:04.632]  Well, he says they're equally culpable, that they were, you know, metaphorically in the same room with the killer in Las Vegas, so they are equally responsible, which is just ridiculous.
[02:08:04.812 --> 02:08:09.035]  It's a ridiculous smear against people who are fighting for Americans' gun rights.
[02:08:09.135 --> 02:08:10.596]  We have this clip I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:08:10.616 --> 02:08:15.179]  This is Keith Oberman saying the NRA should be branded as a terrorist organization.
[02:08:15.199 --> 02:08:17.200]  I mean, he's saying gun owners are terrorists.
[02:08:17.642 --> 02:08:19.964]  Well, if you're a terrorist, then you can have your guns taken away, right?
[02:08:20.465 --> 02:08:22.167]  So, it's what you do.
[02:08:22.247 --> 02:08:25.410]  You marginalize and then you criminalize the behavior.
[02:08:25.630 --> 02:08:27.772]  And that's what Rahm Emanuel famously said.
[02:08:28.587 --> 02:08:31.010]  As he said, you can't let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:35.154]  He said, if you're a gun owner, we'll just put you on a no-fly list and then take your guns.
[02:08:35.414 --> 02:08:35.614]  Right.
[02:08:35.654 --> 02:08:42.521]  If the FBI decides you're a terrorist, then they can come get your guns under the laws that were proposed by the Democrats.
[02:08:42.641 --> 02:08:46.225]  And our president, by the way, supported and then changed his mind about that.
[02:08:46.565 --> 02:08:49.928]  All right, let's go ahead and roll this clip of Keith Olbermann.
[02:08:49.948 --> 02:08:50.249]  Here it is.
[02:08:50.269 --> 02:08:51.170]  That's disgusting.
[02:08:51.823 --> 02:08:59.727]  And why a group that enables such massacres, the National Rifle Association, is not branded for what it is, a terrorist organization.
[02:09:00.668 --> 02:09:15.716]  The gun lobby's interpretation of the Second Amendment, wrote Richard Nixon's conservative Chief Justice of the United States, Warren Burger, is one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American people by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.
[02:09:16.576 --> 02:09:22.919]  The real purpose of the Second Amendment was to ensure that state armies, the militia, would be maintained for the defense of the state.
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:34.265]  The very language of the Second Amendment refutes any argument that it was intended to guarantee every citizen an unfettered right to any kind of weapon he or she desires.
[02:09:34.985 --> 02:09:39.868]  The Second Amendment doesn't guarantee the right to have firearms at all.
[02:09:40.868 --> 02:09:45.729]  There are 7,820 words in our Constitution, amendments included.
[02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:50.010]  The words right and rights appear only 15 times.
[02:09:50.490 --> 02:09:54.731]  Vote, votes, and voting appear only 37 times.
[02:09:54.971 --> 02:09:56.431]  That's enough of this pontificating.
[02:09:56.471 --> 02:10:03.613]  I mean, Jimmy Kimmel's been caught on video with armed bodyguards at his house, at his business, but he also says all gun owners are to blame.
[02:10:03.913 --> 02:10:04.593]  What do you say to this?
[02:10:05.453 --> 02:10:12.399]  Well, first of all, that quote about the Second Amendment, that it doesn't cover the individual right to keep and bear arms, is crazy.
[02:10:12.619 --> 02:10:15.081]  I mean, it's reinterpreting history.
[02:10:15.382 --> 02:10:23.168]  Just because one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court decided that Americans don't have an individual right to keep and bear arms doesn't mean it's true.
[02:10:23.869 --> 02:10:24.790]  We do have that right.
[02:10:24.810 --> 02:10:25.871]  We have an individual right.
[02:10:25.911 --> 02:10:27.032]  And Keith Oberman,
[02:10:28.613 --> 02:10:30.354]  He's reinterpreting the Second Amendment.
[02:10:30.374 --> 02:10:41.117]  And it's the ultimate classism that rich people and elites can have guys with full auto protecting them, and helicopters, and you know, 5,000 acre compounds, but then we can't have guns to protect ourselves.
[02:10:41.177 --> 02:10:41.857]  It's BS!
[02:10:42.397 --> 02:10:43.478]  Well, it's worse than BS.
[02:10:43.518 --> 02:10:44.338]  It's dangerous.
[02:10:44.758 --> 02:10:46.859]  In fact, he's not just calling, he said ban the NRA.
[02:10:47.719 --> 02:10:48.460]  Yes, that's right.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:55.228]  Well, if you have the NRA as a terrorist organization, then you can take their guns and anybody who's a member can have their firearms confiscated.
[02:10:55.268 --> 02:10:55.528]  Absolutely.
[02:10:55.649 --> 02:11:02.637]  So it's a confiscation play and it's pretty thinly veiled, but it's not unexpected and it's not the first time we've heard this before.
[02:11:02.697 --> 02:11:04.279]  Robert Farago for TheButtGuns.com.
[02:11:04.639 --> 02:11:07.782]  Joining us, you're going to be here another 15 minutes, then you're going to go to another big shoot.
[02:11:08.082 --> 02:11:10.665]  He'll be riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour, is Michael Snyder.
[02:11:11.306 --> 02:11:13.688]  He, of course, is an educator, a best-selling author.
[02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:17.072]  He runs websites getting over a million views every week.
[02:11:17.392 --> 02:11:18.713]  TheEconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:11:19.734 --> 02:11:22.516]  Michael Snyder for Congress.com, I guess, running there in Idaho.
[02:11:22.936 --> 02:11:23.596]  I hope he wins.
[02:11:23.616 --> 02:11:24.817]  He's getting some good poll numbers.
[02:11:25.397 --> 02:11:26.698]  Frequent contributor to InfoWars.
[02:11:27.078 --> 02:11:33.782]  Michael Snyder, great to have you here with us in illustrious company, but with a really saddening thing that's happening.
[02:11:34.102 --> 02:11:36.464]  What's your first approximation of what we've witnessed?
[02:11:36.504 --> 02:11:39.325]  We knew the left had their big revolution coming in October.
[02:11:39.345 --> 02:11:41.146]  They said, we're going to start killing you.
[02:11:41.407 --> 02:11:43.468]  This guy with connections to Islamists on the left,
[02:11:44.488 --> 02:11:45.929]  You know, is here doing this.
[02:11:46.029 --> 02:11:54.252]  Maybe he was mad at the casino over debts, or maybe he was an islamicist, but we have the most evidence pointing towards islamicists, but the media is really running from that.
[02:11:54.292 --> 02:11:55.433]  What do you think is going on, Michael?
[02:11:56.973 --> 02:12:05.477]  Yeah, well, Alex, what happened in Las Vegas was a terrible tragedy, and the media is using this to go after the Second Amendment, when I believe it was an attack on Trump supporters.
[02:12:05.557 --> 02:12:08.778]  Now, this guy, they're trying to say, oh, he doesn't have a political background.
[02:12:08.818 --> 02:12:11.239]  Best evidence is the Target, a country music venue.
[02:12:12.623 --> 02:12:13.103]  Exactly.
[02:12:13.504 --> 02:12:16.866]  And if he had been a Trump supporter... It's like an attack on a synagogue.
[02:12:16.886 --> 02:12:18.787]  You'd say it was probably a Muslim or a Nazi.
[02:12:19.067 --> 02:12:26.091]  I mean, I'm not saying that's what happened, but you've got ISIS taking responsibility, and it's an attack on Christian, conservative, veteran, military types.
[02:12:26.491 --> 02:12:28.292]  I mean, it just reeks of that.
[02:12:28.332 --> 02:12:29.033]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:12:29.093 --> 02:12:29.353]  Go ahead.
[02:12:30.723 --> 02:12:31.344]  Oh yeah, Alex.
[02:12:31.584 --> 02:12:37.808]  And somebody had remembered that they had spotted this guy at an anti-Trump protest in Reno back in August.
[02:12:37.848 --> 02:12:39.610]  So people started hunting for this video.
[02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.830]  And they found it.
[02:12:40.930 --> 02:12:43.232]  In fact, we found three different videos.
[02:12:43.292 --> 02:12:44.373]  If people want to check them out.
[02:12:46.277 --> 02:12:51.100]  Yeah, and so we don't know 100% if it's this guy, but we've got him from a whole bunch of different angles.
[02:12:51.161 --> 02:12:55.724]  It appears to be him, a guy in a pink NASA shirt with a pink hat.
[02:12:56.264 --> 02:13:00.887]  And so if he was at the anti-Trump rally in August in Reno, that explains a lot.
[02:13:01.308 --> 02:13:05.551]  Because apparently, you know, this was obviously set up way ahead of time because you had to pick this
[02:13:05.971 --> 02:13:13.993]  Target in advance this country music festival and even the mainstream media is admitting Why would you target a country music festival while lots of Trump supporters are going to be there?
[02:13:14.333 --> 02:13:15.674]  Conservatives are going to be there.
[02:13:15.994 --> 02:13:20.955]  So it'd be the kind of target you would pick if you want to attack Trump supporters.
[02:13:21.355 --> 02:13:23.856]  And obviously he checked into his hotel room way ahead of time.
[02:13:23.896 --> 02:13:24.836]  He had all kinds of guns.
[02:13:25.196 --> 02:13:27.757]  This was an extremely well-planned event.
[02:13:27.777 --> 02:13:28.137]  I know this.
[02:13:28.217 --> 02:13:31.458]  At any hotel I'm at, and everybody knows this, they dig through everything
[02:13:31.798 --> 02:13:33.860]  They do a security sweep the first time the maids go in.
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:35.801]  You put a sturb on, they always come in.
[02:13:36.121 --> 02:13:42.266]  He was there five days with 42 guns, reportedly, and they didn't know, man, something stinks.
[02:13:42.747 --> 02:13:45.329]  Well, it was 23, but that's still a lot of guns.
[02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:47.730]  ABC's reporting 42 now, you may be right.
[02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:52.975]  42 guns, that's... Well, remember, you can only shoot one at a time, so it's kind of weird that he would take that.
[02:13:52.995 --> 02:13:54.376]  Yeah, you'd only really need, like, what, three?
[02:13:55.216 --> 02:13:59.700]  Well, I don't need any to do that kind of... Well, no kidding, but I'm just saying.
[02:14:00.188 --> 02:14:00.788]  Yeah.
[02:14:00.908 --> 02:14:02.389]  Is that him with the NASA shirt?
[02:14:03.209 --> 02:14:03.709]  We don't know.
[02:14:04.270 --> 02:14:05.230]  It's early days.
[02:14:06.450 --> 02:14:08.111]  We don't know his political affiliations.
[02:14:08.151 --> 02:14:09.792]  It would certainly help to know that.
[02:14:10.432 --> 02:14:11.572]  Looks like him.
[02:14:11.612 --> 02:14:12.172]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:12.773 --> 02:14:13.153]  Wow.
[02:14:13.473 --> 02:14:15.013]  I hadn't seen this video.
[02:14:15.093 --> 02:14:15.454]  Wow.
[02:14:17.134 --> 02:14:17.934]  I saw the other ones.
[02:14:18.435 --> 02:14:19.815]  And he reportedly used to live in Florida.
[02:14:19.835 --> 02:14:21.876]  And so he had a little NASA shirt.
[02:14:22.912 --> 02:14:25.814]  Yeah, he had an ex-wife in California as well.
[02:14:25.954 --> 02:14:31.478]  He may have purchased some firearms in California, that was reported, which is really bad news for California.
[02:14:31.538 --> 02:14:35.902]  And this is in, where is this in, where was this, I know this was in Nevada, but where, Michael?
[02:14:37.843 --> 02:14:39.124]  It was in Reno, Nevada.
[02:14:39.164 --> 02:14:41.626]  Reno, Nevada in August, so this was fairly recent.
[02:14:42.186 --> 02:14:46.510]  And, you know, this is disturbing because we're seeing these guys snap like at the baseball field in Virginia.
[02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:50.392]  Well, yeah, that guy said, I'm going out to kill Republicans and the media celebrated it.
[02:14:50.432 --> 02:14:52.134]  They said, hashtag hunt Republicans.
[02:14:54.311 --> 02:14:56.534]  I'm sorry, that last video looks like him.
[02:14:56.854 --> 02:15:00.158]  I'm sorry, bone structure, the way he smiles, he looks like an idiot.
[02:15:00.678 --> 02:15:03.181]  I'm not saying that's the guy, but let's go back to that last video.
[02:15:03.582 --> 02:15:04.943]  Holy Toledo.
[02:15:06.245 --> 02:15:08.087]  I'm telling you, that looks like his eyes, his smile.
[02:15:09.721 --> 02:15:11.502]  Well, we can certainly find that out.
[02:15:11.662 --> 02:15:14.824]  That information should be available as to whether he went there or not.
[02:15:15.764 --> 02:15:18.746]  Well, you know, the police said he was known by them.
[02:15:19.006 --> 02:15:19.266]  Right.
[02:15:19.386 --> 02:15:20.827]  And there he was just talking to the cops.
[02:15:21.768 --> 02:15:24.870]  It's hard to know exactly what they knew, but we should find out.
[02:15:25.290 --> 02:15:27.531]  If that isn't him, that's his brother.
[02:15:27.931 --> 02:15:28.852]  That's his twin brother.
[02:15:29.052 --> 02:15:29.612]  Whoa.
[02:15:30.733 --> 02:15:31.814]  I'm sorry, I'm freaking out right now.
[02:15:31.834 --> 02:15:32.194]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:15:32.794 --> 02:15:35.915]  Well, I'm just saying we need more information about this killer.
[02:15:36.215 --> 02:15:38.276]  We need to know about his gambling debts.
[02:15:38.636 --> 02:15:43.318]  We know he did 16 transactions over $10,000 in the last two weeks as well.
[02:15:43.639 --> 02:15:47.320]  So he had a huge, and I don't think he won somehow.
[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:48.521]  I don't think that was all.
[02:15:48.581 --> 02:15:54.463]  And that would be Islamists that would fund him or some leftist foundation cutout group for him to carry this out.
[02:15:55.263 --> 02:15:56.004]  That's one theory.
[02:15:56.504 --> 02:16:00.585]  Well, the left's been saying they're going to start killing all the conservatives come October 1st.
[02:16:00.645 --> 02:16:01.286]  It was October 1st.
[02:16:05.656 --> 02:16:10.138]  We wanted to be responsible and go through all diplomatic means to get their attention first.
[02:16:10.498 --> 02:16:13.019]  If that doesn't work, General Mattis will take care of it.
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:18.482]  Well, by saying General Mattis will take care of it, you're talking about the Pentagon and you're talking about a military option.
[02:16:18.822 --> 02:16:20.263]  Is that what fire and fury meant?
[02:16:20.983 --> 02:16:28.967]  You have to ask the President what fire and fury meant, but I think we all know that basically, if North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior,
[02:16:29.466 --> 02:16:35.970]  If the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed.
[02:16:38.872 --> 02:16:44.316]  If North Korea continues the way it's going, North Korea will be destroyed.
[02:16:45.777 --> 02:16:47.638]  Now, I've talked to a lot of my military sources.
[02:16:47.678 --> 02:16:52.001]  I've also studied the history of this conflict that's been going on since the late 1940s.
[02:16:52.441 --> 02:16:55.023]  And a war that never ended.
[02:16:55.343 --> 02:16:56.184]  We're under a ceasefire.
[02:16:57.412 --> 02:17:15.869]  And I've had a lot of military experts on who've made the point that you can't just tit-for-tat respond if they strike South Korea or Japan or somebody else or fire missiles at Guam because then they're going to attack Seoul with 100,000 pieces of artillery and attack Japan as well with missiles.
[02:17:16.169 --> 02:17:17.570]  And North Korea said they'll do this.
[02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:19.092]  They've hijacked our ships.
[02:17:19.132 --> 02:17:20.173]  They've hijacked other ships.
[02:17:20.433 --> 02:17:21.294]  They've fired another missile.
[02:17:22.074 --> 02:17:27.296]  Over the weekend, over Japan, threatening to preemptively attack Japan or South Korea or the U.S.
[02:17:27.496 --> 02:17:33.478]  They're pointing a gun at us, threatening us up front, over and over and over again.
[02:17:33.558 --> 02:17:39.020]  So, Trump is rightfully saying, after 50, 60 years of appeasement, what are we supposed to do?
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:43.021]  After all, it's the Clintons that gave him the nukes, gave him the missile delivery systems.
[02:17:43.261 --> 02:17:44.061]  That's not debated.
[02:17:44.101 --> 02:17:45.062]  That's even in the New York Times.
[02:17:45.962 --> 02:17:53.069]  So we're sitting here watching all this unfold, and North Korea continues to make more and more and more and more threats.
[02:17:53.329 --> 02:17:56.953]  So they're saying, listen, if we're forced to respond, you'll be totally destroyed.
[02:17:57.273 --> 02:18:05.581]  Because as I have said a hundred times, you can't just hit them or hit their missile base or stop their ICBMs because the North's going to respond.
[02:18:06.001 --> 02:18:09.945]  If you do attack the North, you have to totally decapitate their leadership.
[02:18:10.385 --> 02:18:12.487]  You have to destroy their troops at the DMZ.
[02:18:12.827 --> 02:18:17.951]  You've got to use tactical nuclear weapons, fire and fury, to take them all out in five minutes.
[02:18:18.592 --> 02:18:21.394]  And still, they're going to be targeting the South and wreaking havoc.
[02:18:21.434 --> 02:18:28.220]  But if you leave them alone, you've got a multi-million person army of brainwashed communists who will follow any order.
[02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:33.621]  We saw that during the first Korean War that's still ongoing, but during the actual heat of the conflict.
[02:18:33.661 --> 02:18:42.063]  So this is an incredible time to be alive right now, and everybody needs to understand these are the times in history when big wars break out.
[02:18:42.324 --> 02:18:44.404]  We saw Venezuela just left the dollar today.
[02:18:45.024 --> 02:18:47.345]  They're a failed state, collapsing.
[02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:50.046]  You've got all these other crises around the world.
[02:18:50.286 --> 02:18:51.466]  You've got global jihadists.
[02:18:51.946 --> 02:18:55.708]  launching attacks every day in Europe and the media trying to cover it up.
[02:18:55.748 --> 02:19:00.872]  You've got martial law basically already declared in England and troops on the street.
[02:19:00.912 --> 02:19:08.977]  You've got Black Lives Matter and other leftist groups like Antifa activated by George Soros and the big tax-free foundations to destabilize the United States.
[02:19:09.297 --> 02:19:15.821]  There's all these different forces in this great time of change moving and jockeying for power and we the people
[02:19:16.221 --> 02:19:38.396]  Every race, color, and creed that want free market, religious freedom, open, free society have to stand up and speak out and point out that it's globalists and globalism and collectivists from the billionaires at Google and the folks at Facebook to despots like Kim Jong-un that are the centralizers of power and who are taking control of society and who are destabilizing things to consolidate control and they're the enemy.
[02:19:38.676 --> 02:19:41.138]  It's the globalists that gave the nukes to North Korea.
[02:19:41.358 --> 02:19:43.539]  It's the globalists that gave them the missiles and appeased it.
[02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:45.821]  And now the world's being forced
[02:19:46.061 --> 02:19:48.062]  To stand up and wake up and say no.
[02:19:48.442 --> 02:19:49.182]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:49.202 --> 02:19:50.302]  This is the InfoWar.
[02:19:51.282 --> 02:19:56.464]  North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.
[02:19:57.724 --> 02:20:01.125]  They will be met with fire and fury.
[02:20:06.286 --> 02:20:08.947]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:35.715 --> 02:20:39.898]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:20:40.318 --> 02:20:43.040]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:49.585]  Michael Schneider is our guest.
[02:20:49.685 --> 02:20:52.227]  Robert Ferrago, also, TheTruthAboutGuns.com.
[02:20:53.147 --> 02:20:54.889]  He is our guest here in studio.
[02:20:56.164 --> 02:21:00.248]  Let me ask Michael Snyder, and of course, you this as well, where do you see this going?
[02:21:00.308 --> 02:21:06.493]  Because they're in full war mode, blaming all gun owners, blaming the NRA, banning everything, foaming at the mouth.
[02:21:06.893 --> 02:21:09.516]  There's usually copycat shootings once these things start up.
[02:21:09.616 --> 02:21:15.761]  I mean, the whole season, I'm sure you've seen the left calling for revolution everywhere and, you know, public officials saying they're going to kill Trump.
[02:21:16.141 --> 02:21:17.763]  I mean, it's just, it's an incredible atmosphere.
[02:21:18.503 --> 02:21:27.807]  I haven't seen it this bad since the 60s, when we had a real split between Democrat and Republican, hippie and straight, martini drinker and marijuana person.
[02:21:28.147 --> 02:21:36.171]  The country is divided on the basis of small government, big government, really, and we're not getting any better.
[02:21:36.231 --> 02:21:37.051]  We're not getting any closer.
[02:21:37.191 --> 02:21:38.212]  One side has to win.
[02:21:38.672 --> 02:21:40.053]  And I'm not talking about a shooting war.
[02:21:40.073 --> 02:21:41.975]  I'm talking about a voting war and a culture war.
[02:21:42.316 --> 02:21:43.897]  But this can't stand.
[02:21:44.017 --> 02:21:45.118]  The center will not hold.
[02:21:45.298 --> 02:21:48.181]  We have people on one hand who value individual liberty.
[02:21:48.522 --> 02:21:51.084]  We have people on the other hand who want to take control of our lives.
[02:21:51.725 --> 02:21:52.966]  Somebody has to win this.
[02:21:54.187 --> 02:21:54.387]  I don't
[02:22:16.335 --> 02:22:38.960]  Slow cultural movement ahead because remember there are a lot of gun owners in California and the Supreme Court of the United States has to hear a Gun case which restores our rights the whole idea of may issue You know that the government can decide whether you may or may not have a firearm Has to be struck down and until it is we are all in danger not just California the rest of the country as well It's a it's a it's a war.
[02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:41.381]  It's an info war it is what happens when the
[02:22:42.881 --> 02:22:48.482]  Immovable object runs into the unstoppable force, Michael Schneider, because that's where we are here.
[02:22:48.903 --> 02:22:51.923]  Two runaway trains going dead, head up against each other.
[02:22:51.943 --> 02:22:58.785]  The parasites that want to seize control of the wild, wild west country that made us so great, they're at loggerheads with that.
[02:22:58.805 --> 02:23:00.485]  I mean, they know the truth.
[02:23:00.605 --> 02:23:01.546]  They know it's about control.
[02:23:01.566 --> 02:23:02.986]  Jimmy Kimmel knows he has armed guards.
[02:23:03.346 --> 02:23:05.166]  He just wants the proles down there disarmed.
[02:23:05.506 --> 02:23:07.667]  What happens as this great collision comes together?
[02:23:09.235 --> 02:23:11.796]  Yeah, Alex, this is a shooting war.
[02:23:12.036 --> 02:23:13.477]  The left is shooting us now.
[02:23:13.577 --> 02:23:15.738]  It's a civil war and it's gone hot.
[02:23:15.918 --> 02:23:17.599]  And the left, they've embraced violence.
[02:23:17.639 --> 02:23:21.841]  In fact, Antifa, their leaders say violence is necessary to achieve their goals.
[02:23:21.861 --> 02:23:27.063]  I was about to say, when you have Antifa and the Islamists and all of them saying, we're going to start killing you in October.
[02:23:27.543 --> 02:23:29.725]  And they're training everywhere, and it's all over the news Friday.
[02:23:29.805 --> 02:23:31.426]  I predict it by October 1st.
[02:23:31.847 --> 02:23:33.828]  On Friday, the 29th and 28th.
[02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:35.570]  And then it starts happening.
[02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:37.331]  I mean, they are the prime suspects.
[02:23:37.371 --> 02:23:37.852]  I'm sorry.
[02:23:38.072 --> 02:23:40.514]  I think your theory about how... Well, repeat that.
[02:23:40.554 --> 02:23:41.435]  You said it during the break.
[02:23:41.715 --> 02:23:44.678]  You mentioned it earlier, but you really... You were almost selling me on him.
[02:23:44.998 --> 02:23:47.400]  Pissed off at the casino that cut him off.
[02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:53.424]  Well, remember, this is just a theory as well, but we know that he had tremendous gambling debts.
[02:23:53.524 --> 02:23:58.607]  Well, I'm assuming they're debts, because there were 16 transactions over $10,000 over the last two weeks.
[02:23:59.007 --> 02:24:00.528]  So we know he was gambling a lot.
[02:24:00.708 --> 02:24:09.574]  Now, I don't know if you know any addicts, any people who are addicted to a substance, whether it's gambling or marijuana or cocaine or alcohol, but if you remove it,
[02:24:10.534 --> 02:24:12.116]  It can really set people off.
[02:24:12.176 --> 02:24:13.257]  They can go crazy.
[02:24:13.657 --> 02:24:16.539]  So perhaps he thought, well, you know, I've spent all this money at the casino.
[02:24:16.559 --> 02:24:17.460]  Now I have nothing.
[02:24:17.740 --> 02:24:18.781]  They won't give me a stake.
[02:24:19.581 --> 02:24:21.002]  So I'm going to take my revenge on them.
[02:24:21.063 --> 02:24:21.783]  I'll show them.
[02:24:21.983 --> 02:24:28.408]  But instead, it sounds like this guy that had a $400,000 house and was retired for years was incredibly wealthy.
[02:24:28.869 --> 02:24:30.590]  $160,000 spent in the last month.
[02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:34.633]  $100,000 he wired last week to the Philippines.
[02:24:35.213 --> 02:24:37.215]  It looks like this guy has been given a lot of cash.
[02:24:37.375 --> 02:24:39.256]  Well, gamblers lose a lot of cash.
[02:24:39.316 --> 02:24:41.718]  You know, there are people who are, they can't stop gambling.
[02:24:42.178 --> 02:24:44.239]  So I'm saying, why was he all flush with all this money then?
[02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:49.062]  Well, he had real estate investments, he was an accountant, he may have been spending other people's money as well.
[02:24:49.082 --> 02:24:51.403]  He may have been taking his clients' money and gambling with that.
[02:24:51.664 --> 02:24:52.804]  Look, it's just a theory.
[02:24:53.064 --> 02:24:56.627]  But I want to point something out, Alex, is that, you know, people focus on the guns that he had.
[02:24:56.947 --> 02:24:59.048]  This gentleman had a private pilot's license.
[02:24:59.088 --> 02:25:00.209]  He could have flown that into a building.
[02:25:00.689 --> 02:25:02.590]  It's like the IRS building here in Austin.
[02:25:02.830 --> 02:25:07.471]  Right, so it's not really the means that are important, it's the people behind it.
[02:25:07.491 --> 02:25:08.332]  No, no, I agree.
[02:25:08.512 --> 02:25:12.693]  They're saying people shooting gun videos are talking about guns are hurting people's feelings.
[02:25:13.313 --> 02:25:13.533]  Yes?
[02:25:16.334 --> 02:25:17.435]  I'm sorry, crew, just popped in my head.
[02:25:17.455 --> 02:25:17.675]  Go ahead.
[02:25:19.718 --> 02:25:20.238]  Well there you go.
[02:25:20.318 --> 02:25:23.900]  Gunman Steven Paddock was a multi-millionaire retiree gambler with no criminal record.
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:24.940]  Yeah, I remember saying that.
[02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:29.202]  Well, multi-millionaire gamblers can also lose all their money.
[02:25:29.762 --> 02:25:33.764]  So it doesn't mean he was a success... I mean, show me a successful gambler, by the way.
[02:25:33.784 --> 02:25:36.185]  I mean, how many people can actually stay ahead of the house?
[02:25:36.645 --> 02:25:39.806]  So, if he's gambling, as far as I'm concerned, he's losing.
[02:25:40.106 --> 02:25:43.568]  And if he's losing, that's going to create... Yeah, the house is usually about 65%, 70% at odds against you.
[02:25:47.009 --> 02:25:49.711]  If you keep winning in a casino, they know you're cheating and throw you out.
[02:25:50.052 --> 02:25:50.252]  Right.
[02:25:50.452 --> 02:25:53.374]  I mean, it's a... They don't let you win one way or the other.
[02:25:53.695 --> 02:25:55.516]  Well, that's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:25:55.536 --> 02:25:56.937]  That's the truth, as far as I know.
[02:25:57.198 --> 02:26:06.025]  Yeah, they have a few highly-published... I was like, my wife never goes to casinos, but once with her dad, you know, up in somewhere... well, it was like outside Omaha.
[02:26:06.325 --> 02:26:13.812]  They go, she was losing, but they went ahead and had her win a jackpot because she was good-looking to put her on the big TVs, and then everybody starts shelling out their money.
[02:26:14.392 --> 02:26:17.353]  We don't know why this guy started to kill people.
[02:26:17.733 --> 02:26:19.394]  He may have been a thrill killer as well.
[02:26:19.454 --> 02:26:21.195]  That's another possibility.
[02:26:21.255 --> 02:26:25.877]  You have some theories, which I'm not entirely on board with, but we don't know the situation yet.
[02:26:26.077 --> 02:26:28.398]  Well, most of the attacks to Islamists are leftist now.
[02:26:28.838 --> 02:26:31.179]  They're saying they're going to kill us in the revolutions coming in October.
[02:26:31.419 --> 02:26:33.820]  And they attack a bunch of people in a country music deal.
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:37.702]  You've got the motive, you've got the people they target, you've got all this.
[02:26:38.142 --> 02:26:41.063]  I'm not saying that's what happened, that's what it points at.
[02:26:41.263 --> 02:26:42.644]  You have ISIS taking responsibility.
[02:26:43.072 --> 02:26:43.312]  Right.
[02:26:43.412 --> 02:26:47.534]  Well, ISIS takes responsibility for any killing of large numbers of people.
[02:26:48.475 --> 02:26:50.075]  I mean, by a civilian.
[02:26:50.115 --> 02:26:53.777]  Certainly, look, we want to know what his motivations were.
[02:26:54.217 --> 02:26:57.038]  But the people on the other side of this don't care what his motivations were.
[02:26:57.058 --> 02:26:58.359]  They're going to blame us regardless.
[02:26:58.479 --> 02:26:58.699]  Right.
[02:26:58.779 --> 02:27:01.621]  So here we are being moral, saying we're not sure.
[02:27:01.661 --> 02:27:05.242]  They're already blaming us, saying all gun owners are terrorists and are responsible.
[02:27:05.262 --> 02:27:07.723]  Michael Snyder, we're going to continue with you the rest of the hour.
[02:27:07.743 --> 02:27:08.784]  Our guest is about to leave us.
[02:27:09.124 --> 02:27:11.105]  But what's your main focus when we come back?
[02:27:13.017 --> 02:27:14.459]  Oh, I want to talk about what's coming next.
[02:27:14.519 --> 02:27:22.747]  On November 4th, Antifa has said, hey, we're going to start these protests against Trump, and we're not going to stop until Trump is removed from office.
[02:27:23.267 --> 02:27:28.172]  And we can get into who's behind this on the website, and they'll link to radical communist groups.
[02:27:28.653 --> 02:27:34.919]  In fact, the guy who set up this website, he's got a book out called The Coming Civil War.
[02:27:35.419 --> 02:27:45.572]  So Antifa has embraced violence, the DHS, FBI have said that, that they're on board, they're warning that these are domestic terrorists, that they've been involved in domestic terrorism.
[02:27:45.592 --> 02:27:52.220]  They're saying November 4th it starts, and they're saying it's not going to stop until the Trump-Pence regime ends.
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:55.601]  Well, we were predicting this was coming, and so our prediction came true.
[02:27:55.941 --> 02:28:02.102]  No one can deny that, because you got a bunch of leftist groups saying we're going to start killing people October 1st, the full war starts November 4th.
[02:28:02.382 --> 02:28:04.782]  I hope it's not the case, but it looks like it's starting to happen.
[02:28:05.282 --> 02:28:08.203]  Well, these people, these Antifa people, are just useful idiots.
[02:28:08.303 --> 02:28:10.223]  They're the front end of the spear.
[02:28:10.243 --> 02:28:10.723]  I agree.
[02:28:10.923 --> 02:28:14.684]  It's the elitist politicians we have to really look out for.
[02:28:14.704 --> 02:28:16.044]  I agree.
[02:28:16.064 --> 02:28:17.465]  Well, I hope you'll join us more.
[02:28:17.825 --> 02:28:19.505]  Robert Farago, TheTruthAboutGuns.com.
[02:28:20.225 --> 02:28:21.025]  Really smart guy.
[02:28:21.045 --> 02:28:21.745]  A lot of great points.
[02:28:21.805 --> 02:28:24.546]  And thanks for your great work in defense of the entire Bill of Rights.
[02:28:24.826 --> 02:28:25.326]  Thank you, sir.
[02:28:25.586 --> 02:28:27.967]  We're going to go to break and come back on the other side.
[02:28:27.987 --> 02:28:28.927]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:28:29.247 --> 02:28:30.788]  Remember, they're wanting to get rid of the First Amendment.
[02:28:30.808 --> 02:28:32.488]  They're trying to block us on Facebook, Twitter.
[02:28:32.808 --> 02:28:33.969]  It's up to you to spread the links.
[02:28:34.449 --> 02:28:36.289]  The videos that are up on InfoWars.com.
[02:28:36.329 --> 02:28:40.410]  These articles that FBI source Vega Shooter found in Antifa literature.
[02:28:40.771 --> 02:28:41.931]  Photos taken in the Middle East.
[02:28:42.311 --> 02:28:45.932]  And now they've confirmed his girlfriend did visit Dubai and other areas of the Middle East.
[02:28:46.352 --> 02:28:50.554]  All-out war against the NRA begins at the Las Vegas Massacre and more straight ahead.
[02:28:50.915 --> 02:28:57.498]  And we've got Laura Loomer with her research with connections to this guy and Antifa to the radical Islamists.
[02:28:57.518 --> 02:28:57.938]  Stay with us.
[02:28:58.119 --> 02:28:58.679]  We'll be right back.

[02:31:05.330 --> 02:31:14.574]  I want to hire a bunch of people, because I'm all in this year, spending everything on expansion, adding those shows, adding more broadcasters, adding more camera crews.
[02:31:15.175 --> 02:31:19.077]  We're going to send a crew into Puerto Rico to get some attention on that.
[02:31:19.737 --> 02:31:20.457]  Still no power.
[02:31:20.897 --> 02:31:21.718]  I mean, it's dire.
[02:31:22.218 --> 02:31:24.799]  So it takes a lot of money to fund all this, obviously.

[02:33:06.825 --> 02:33:09.430]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.918 --> 02:33:27.223]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:33:27.263 --> 02:33:30.085]  You better believe you got one!
[02:33:31.686 --> 02:33:36.871]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.911 --> 02:33:43.496]  Well, you got this paddock guy that was the supposed shooter.
[02:33:50.862 --> 02:33:54.924]  Is that going to do anything good for the fancy Swiss watchmaker?
[02:33:57.886 --> 02:34:01.088]  A lot of smart folks I talk to think he's a total patsy and a cutout.
[02:34:01.508 --> 02:34:11.073]  And I've talked to a lot of military folks, you know, real operators, and they say you can clearly, in video after video, hear two different types of firearms.
[02:34:12.974 --> 02:34:19.157]  Some type of crank operation or belt fed, and then a more classic semi-auto.
[02:34:19.177 --> 02:34:20.098]  Let's roll some of that footage.
[02:34:55.012 --> 02:34:58.594]  And this guy's 400 yards away at the beginning of the stadium.
[02:34:58.614 --> 02:34:59.254]  600 towards the end.
[02:34:59.874 --> 02:35:01.635]  But the gunshots sound so close.
[02:35:01.735 --> 02:35:03.456]  I tell you, this whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[02:35:05.277 --> 02:35:07.698]  Michael Snyder, we knew this was coming.
[02:35:07.738 --> 02:35:09.759]  I mean, I hate to sit here and say we were so right.
[02:35:10.039 --> 02:35:13.120]  The left is saying, October 1st, we start killing.
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:16.241]  I go to gun ranges, which I never have time to go to.
[02:35:16.341 --> 02:35:19.643]  I've been going to a lot of gun ranges to investigate.
[02:35:20.711 --> 02:35:25.613]  And they tell me, no, mainly we have women and Muslims and leftists in here training for civil war.
[02:35:26.353 --> 02:35:30.774]  And then I run into the Truth About Guns guy, and he was like, yeah, there were a bunch of Muslim women in there.
[02:35:32.175 --> 02:35:38.616]  Well, I talked to the owners, and I'm not going to get into all of it, but I'm going to tell you where I was at, and they said, no, there was four groups that day.
[02:35:38.636 --> 02:35:39.837]  And I'm sure they're great people.
[02:35:40.257 --> 02:35:44.558]  The point is, is that the left is finally coming in and firing firearms.
[02:35:46.579 --> 02:35:49.260]  And a lot of the left are saying they're getting ready for this war.
[02:35:50.242 --> 02:36:05.912]  And then if you had a Jewish synagogue attacked like this by a gunman, or a black church, you know, pretty much a few hours into it you say, I bet it was a white supremacist, or I bet it was, you know, an islamicist.
[02:36:06.412 --> 02:36:14.457]  But you've got a predominantly white, Christian, conservative, veteran-type group being attacked, a country music
[02:36:15.382 --> 02:36:15.662]  Thank you.
[02:36:35.521 --> 02:36:46.163]  So, you've got the target that gives you a motive, you've got ISIS taking responsibility, and even Associated Press said ISIS usually is truthful when they take responsibility for something.
[02:36:47.343 --> 02:36:59.445]  They didn't take responsibility for the knife attack in France Sunday, or the car attack, even though the guy had an ISIS flag and was yelling Allah Akbar in Canada, but they did take credit for this, and the media says, oh no, that's not true.
[02:37:00.726 --> 02:37:02.006]  What do you make of this, Michael Steiner?
[02:37:03.288 --> 02:37:08.251]  Yeah, and then you had that lady running around 45 minutes beforehand telling people, oh, you're all going to die.
[02:37:08.271 --> 02:37:11.773]  I mean, clearly, you know, this was something people knew in advance.
[02:37:12.054 --> 02:37:13.194]  It wasn't just a lone wolf.
[02:37:13.595 --> 02:37:20.019]  But Alex, you know, regardless of this event, how people want to spin it, I'm entirely convinced it was a direct attack on Trump supporters.
[02:37:20.459 --> 02:37:26.484]  We know that on November 4th, if you go to refusefascism.org, they've got a big press release about it.
[02:37:26.784 --> 02:37:28.465]  They're saying they're going to take to the streets.
[02:37:28.585 --> 02:37:30.387]  And this isn't going to be like Occupy Wall Street.
[02:37:30.447 --> 02:37:31.848]  And by the way, this is a big group.
[02:37:31.928 --> 02:37:43.697]  And then we, Paul, have the article Friday with scores of videos from Crowder and Veritas, Drugs linked to it, where they're saying, we're going to attack and start killing November 4th.
[02:37:43.757 --> 02:37:43.977]  I mean,
[02:37:44.778 --> 02:37:46.658]  Yeah, but I've been to a bunch of gun ranges.
[02:37:46.698 --> 02:37:49.799]  They're all, say the left's there, and they go, oh, did you wake up about the second one?
[02:37:49.819 --> 02:37:51.300]  They go, no, we're ready for war.
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:38:05.023]  Yeah, and the people behind refusefascism.org, it's directly linked to the Revolutionary Communist Party here in the United States, and the individual that leads that party has actually written a book entitled The Coming Civil War.
[02:38:05.163 --> 02:38:09.424]  And they're openly talking about, yeah, we're going to use violence, and they justify it this way.
[02:38:09.864 --> 02:38:19.228]  They consider Donald Trump to be another Hitler, and they say, whatever we have to do to stop the rise of another Hitler, we're going to do, including violence.
[02:38:19.288 --> 02:38:26.070]  So they believe they're justified in using violence, and they're actually training with guns, training with knives, all this.
[02:38:26.130 --> 02:38:27.331]  They're training in the Middle East.
[02:38:27.691 --> 02:38:39.076]  Hey, I said on Sunday with my counter-terrorism expert, listen, I had a former high-level CIA guy on there yesterday.
[02:38:39.336 --> 02:38:41.617]  He thinks it's a false flag against Trump supporters as well.
[02:38:41.917 --> 02:38:43.057]  And he ran whole operations.
[02:38:43.117 --> 02:38:47.999]  I mean, plus the threats by former deputy directors that they're going to kill Trump.
[02:38:48.259 --> 02:38:50.040]  That is a direct threat to the president.
[02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:53.922]  And I was told by CIA sources that Kimmel, before it was ever in the news,
[02:38:54.810 --> 02:38:58.091]  Was getting deep state Democrat direction.
[02:38:58.331 --> 02:39:04.393]  That's now confirmed here by the Hill and the Associated Press.
[02:39:05.033 --> 02:39:07.814]  And they told me, no, that Kimmel thing is a direct threat.
[02:39:08.154 --> 02:39:15.536]  When he puts the gun out and says, we're going to kill you, Alex Jones, if you don't leave our New World Order alone, that that was a direct threat.
[02:39:15.796 --> 02:39:18.297]  That they are communicating with us through these programs.
[02:39:19.724 --> 02:39:20.324]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:39:20.485 --> 02:39:29.210]  And this movement starting up on November 4th, they say they only have one goal, one demand, and that's the removal of the Trump-Pence regime by any means necessary.
[02:39:29.451 --> 02:39:31.932]  And they're openly saying they're willing to use violence to do it.
[02:39:31.972 --> 02:39:37.176]  So why aren't these people all in prison for directly threatening the president, directly threatening the Constitution?
[02:39:37.476 --> 02:39:45.261]  In fact, the Revolutionary Communist Party has drafted, actually drafted, a constitution for a post-American order to replace the U.S.
[02:39:45.301 --> 02:39:48.383]  Constitution for a North American socialist movement.
[02:39:48.403 --> 02:39:49.524]  Which is exactly what?
[02:39:50.525 --> 02:39:57.053]  Larry Grathwald, the Green Beret who infiltrated them at the highest levels, the Weathermen, they were planning this in the 70s.
[02:39:57.113 --> 02:39:58.254]  It's the exact same plan.
[02:39:59.781 --> 02:40:00.661]  It absolutely is.
[02:40:00.781 --> 02:40:04.522]  And so they are openly saying they want to overthrow the United States government.
[02:40:04.762 --> 02:40:07.143]  They want to take down Trump by any means necessary.
[02:40:07.443 --> 02:40:13.524]  And so when we, you know, take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, these are the kind of guys we're talking about.
[02:40:13.784 --> 02:40:14.745]  These are bad guys.
[02:40:14.945 --> 02:40:15.985]  These are violent guys.
[02:40:16.285 --> 02:40:24.607]  And they're not just going to attack Trump, but conservatives, conservative politicians, which I'm alarmed about because I'm out there doing campaign events.
[02:40:24.947 --> 02:40:27.469]  But we need to understand what we're up against.
[02:40:27.489 --> 02:40:29.511]  We're up against violent revolutionaries.
[02:40:29.751 --> 02:40:30.872]  They're going to use violence.
[02:40:31.032 --> 02:40:32.073]  They want a civil war.
[02:40:32.313 --> 02:40:34.034]  They want American cities to burn.
[02:40:34.335 --> 02:40:35.996]  All the things we've been warning about for so long.
[02:40:36.076 --> 02:40:37.597]  And it's all coming true!
[02:40:37.717 --> 02:40:39.379]  October 1st they said it starts.
[02:40:39.399 --> 02:40:40.520]  November 4th it peaks.
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:43.862]  And I was like on Sunday saying get ready today for it to happen.
[02:40:43.942 --> 02:40:44.443]  It's here!
[02:40:46.836 --> 02:40:49.077]  And Laura Loomer, we'd already have her on, but her Skype was breaking up.
[02:40:49.097 --> 02:40:50.197]  Let's go to her right now.
[02:40:50.557 --> 02:40:51.897]  Laura Loomer, thank you so much.
[02:40:51.937 --> 02:40:59.698]  Investigative journalist confronting Hillary, Uma Abedin, confronting the Kill Trump thespian activity with Shakespeare in the Park.
[02:40:59.738 --> 02:41:00.539]  Great to have you here.
[02:41:01.399 --> 02:41:02.659]  You've done some big research.
[02:41:02.679 --> 02:41:14.461]  The memo from the CEO of the Mandalay Bay in the casino telling employees to donate to super hardcore leftist cop killer associated groups.
[02:41:15.672 --> 02:41:25.037]  Yeah, I have exclusively obtained an internal memo that Jim Moran, the CEO of MGM Resorts, which owns Mandalay, where this attack took place.
[02:41:25.437 --> 02:41:33.961]  And if you read it, you can see that he's telling his employees that he will match donations if they donate to groups like CARE, which is a terrorist organization.
[02:41:34.401 --> 02:41:34.981]  I don't
[02:41:54.251 --> 02:42:00.314]  I agree with you Alex, I think this is a false flag.
[02:42:00.534 --> 02:42:06.137]  I don't think that ISIS is just going to claim responsibility for an attack that they didn't have anything to do with.
[02:42:07.397 --> 02:42:12.880]  I was on your show about two weeks ago and you and I were discussing how Antifa is now adopting ISIS tactics.
[02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:18.285]  And we've seen over the past few months that the left has aligned itself with Islam.
[02:42:18.366 --> 02:42:29.798]  We see it through the Women's March, we see it with the way they create their own logos, infusing them with women wearing hijabs, and they cover their face in black attire, just like ISIS, and they wave black flags.
[02:42:29.818 --> 02:42:34.102]  Oh yeah, the left is merging with radical Islam, and Linda Serser, we're being force-fed it.
[02:42:34.402 --> 02:42:34.583]  Right.
[02:42:35.642 --> 02:42:36.162]  Well, stay there.
[02:42:36.182 --> 02:42:45.247]  Let's talk about this bombshell memo, you guy, that we're retweeting at RealAlexJones and posting to Infowars.com.
[02:42:46.027 --> 02:42:46.848]  This is amazing.
[02:42:46.888 --> 02:42:53.971]  We already knew he was funding these groups, but here it is, absolutely saying that he will max the money if you do it.
[02:42:54.551 --> 02:42:57.313]  And then the guy was protected in their hotel.
[02:42:57.553 --> 02:42:59.974]  There's no way the maid service for five days didn't know what was going on.
[02:43:00.194 --> 02:43:01.395]  This thing stinks to high heaven.
[02:43:01.415 --> 02:43:01.855]  Stay with us.
[02:43:02.498 --> 02:43:06.019]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[02:43:06.479 --> 02:43:12.521]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[02:43:12.741 --> 02:43:15.722]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:16.102 --> 02:43:19.103]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:43:19.303 --> 02:43:22.744]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[02:43:23.084 --> 02:43:24.844]  The left controls culture.
[02:43:24.864 --> 02:43:25.845]  They control art.
[02:43:25.925 --> 02:43:27.145]  They control entertainment.
[02:43:27.445 --> 02:43:30.886]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why
[02:43:31.286 --> 02:43:34.508]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:43:34.568 --> 02:43:36.969]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[02:43:37.449 --> 02:43:41.311]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:43:41.371 --> 02:43:46.754]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan.
[02:43:46.994 --> 02:43:49.455]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:43:49.716 --> 02:43:52.397]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[02:43:52.797 --> 02:43:55.938]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[02:43:56.018 --> 02:43:57.738]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[02:43:57.878 --> 02:43:59.059]  It's available right now.
[02:43:59.359 --> 02:44:01.919]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:06.961 --> 02:44:09.181]  I've got a very simple sales strategy.
[02:44:10.862 --> 02:44:11.822]  It's develop,
[02:44:12.719 --> 02:44:17.620]  And sell products that I personally use for my family at affordable prices.
[02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:19.200]  Because I want you to get great results.
[02:44:19.801 --> 02:44:21.741]  And I want you to come back and keep buying the product.
[02:44:22.461 --> 02:44:23.741]  Because I follow the golden rule.
[02:44:23.801 --> 02:44:25.082]  Treat others as you want to be treated.
[02:44:25.882 --> 02:44:30.383]  Now we have developed True Whey Protein from one of the top developers in the country.
[02:44:30.403 --> 02:44:34.344]  And probably labeled it at an affordable price that is delicious.
[02:44:35.384 --> 02:44:36.124]  I put the whey in.
[02:44:36.204 --> 02:44:39.225]  And ours is the best for the price it is.
[02:44:39.265 --> 02:44:39.725]  It's high quality.
[02:44:41.676 --> 02:44:49.843]  With either strawberry or chocolate flavored bone broth that has obviously incredible benefits.
[02:44:51.645 --> 02:45:01.474]  And you mix this together and you put in some organic milk, you put in some strawberries, some blueberries, some cherries.
[02:45:02.054 --> 02:45:02.575]  It's amazing.
[02:45:03.971 --> 02:45:05.192]  And I've gotten spoiled with this.
[02:45:05.372 --> 02:45:06.392]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:45:06.873 --> 02:45:09.954]  The last six months we developed this product and I was testing it.
[02:45:10.594 --> 02:45:15.297]  The energy it gives me, the mill replacement, all of it has spoiled me.
[02:45:15.857 --> 02:45:17.578]  And you can add fruit to it if you want.
[02:45:18.759 --> 02:45:20.179]  You can add ice to it if you want.
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:21.120]  But...
[02:45:22.199 --> 02:45:27.441]  The True Whey Protein with the Caveman Formula together is simply incredible.
[02:45:28.342 --> 02:45:31.263]  And it's something that supports our broadcast so you can't lose.
[02:45:31.323 --> 02:45:42.887]  But I want people to experience what concentrated bone broth does with chaga, mushroom, and with the turmeric, and with the bee pollen, and then with the high-quality whey together.
[02:45:43.528 --> 02:45:44.108]  It's amazing.
[02:45:50.109 --> 02:45:51.790]  This is a true superfood.
[02:45:52.330 --> 02:45:56.412]  Of the 30 plus products we put out that are all great, this one is the most amazing.
[02:45:56.913 --> 02:46:01.535]  When it just comes to, I take this for breakfast, I'm not hungry till like 6, 7 at night.
[02:46:02.055 --> 02:46:03.056]  I have so much energy.
[02:46:04.016 --> 02:46:07.898]  But it spoiled me because I used to work out to not be overweight.
[02:46:08.119 --> 02:46:08.359]  Now,
[02:46:09.139 --> 02:46:10.479]  This has changed my whole life.
[02:46:11.220 --> 02:46:12.480]  Bone broth is so amazing.
[02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:15.061]  Mixed with high-quality whey, it's even more incredible.
[02:46:15.401 --> 02:46:19.322]  Mixed with some berries and some high-quality organic milk, it's delicious.
[02:46:20.082 --> 02:46:21.702]  It's all available at mfoolerstore.com.
[02:46:21.862 --> 02:46:24.503]  And you can't lose because of your support in the broadcast.
[02:46:24.803 --> 02:46:25.803]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:46:26.183 --> 02:46:31.705]  Find out why Caveman and our true whey is so game-changing at mfoolerstore.com.

[02:46:52.515 --> 02:46:53.735]  It's Brain Force Plus.

[02:47:06.791 --> 02:47:09.436]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:26.852 --> 02:47:37.565]  Well, I'll tell you this, the consensus around the office, Alex Jones here back live, thank you for joining us, is that this guy's a patsy.
[02:47:38.573 --> 02:47:39.374]  And he was set up.
[02:47:40.274 --> 02:47:43.436]  I just said, look at the target, look at the timing, look at what the left said they were going to do.
[02:47:43.976 --> 02:47:45.858]  Look at the owners of Mandalay Bay.
[02:47:46.198 --> 02:47:46.998]  Huge leftist.
[02:47:47.038 --> 02:47:47.819]  We knew that now.
[02:47:47.879 --> 02:47:49.680]  Laura Loomer has gotten the exclusive memo.
[02:47:50.260 --> 02:47:56.084]  We're posting to Infowars.com, where he's saying, give to the big Islamic group here in the U.S.
[02:47:56.124 --> 02:47:56.484]  Care.
[02:47:57.125 --> 02:48:00.427]  Give to the Chinese government-connected group.
[02:48:01.347 --> 02:48:02.728]  Give to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:48:03.829 --> 02:48:04.349]  You name it.
[02:48:04.549 --> 02:48:05.069]  ADL.
[02:48:05.109 --> 02:48:05.550]  You name it.
[02:48:06.656 --> 02:48:09.098]  So this is a big leftist hotel, big leftist group.
[02:48:09.738 --> 02:48:13.220]  So, I mean, there's no way you get 42 guns up in there and they don't know.
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:15.882]  I mean, that's just, they dig through everything you do at a hotel, folks.
[02:48:16.242 --> 02:48:24.568]  First day you get there, then we'll talk to Laura Loomer here in this segment and the next, and we'll get a final comment from Michael Snyder here in just a moment.
[02:48:24.648 --> 02:48:26.789]  Before we go any further, we're listener supported.
[02:48:27.410 --> 02:48:30.792]  We're running big specials that are going to end in the next few days on
[02:48:33.683 --> 02:48:43.790]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion with the amino acids, that Fruit Punch, so your kids and yourself, especially old folks, great for them, get their organic vitamins and minerals, amino acids, where you can absorb them.
[02:48:44.170 --> 02:48:47.172]  That's 50% off right now, never done that before, but we want folks to try it.
[02:48:47.853 --> 02:48:49.514]  That is a really high quality product.
[02:48:49.774 --> 02:48:50.835]  That special's about to end.
[02:48:51.135 --> 02:49:02.683]  Secret 12, super high quality vitamin B12, highest quality out there, even according to big third party reviews, that even BuzzFeed did, they couldn't believe it was actually the cleanest, highest quality that there is available, according to their own testers.
[02:49:03.523 --> 02:49:09.628]  They inadvertently didn't point that out, but they listed on their site that actually the company we private label for is the highest rated in the country.
[02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:11.189]  So there you go.
[02:49:11.530 --> 02:49:13.271]  Brain Force Plus is the new special.
[02:49:13.671 --> 02:49:15.012]  50% off on that nootropic.
[02:49:15.373 --> 02:49:16.974]  Great chance to stock back up on that.
[02:49:16.994 --> 02:49:21.257]  20% off on the air filtration systems from Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:49:21.277 --> 02:49:22.618]  30% off on water filtration systems.
[02:49:22.919 --> 02:49:26.181]  But a lot of these specials are about to end in the next day or two.
[02:49:26.321 --> 02:49:29.724]  The special that will continue for a week is the Brain Force Plus.
[02:49:30.184 --> 02:49:31.846]  We have the fluoride-free toothpaste and more.
[02:49:32.808 --> 02:49:48.136]  So, continuing, Laura Loomer, you got this exclusive documentation, you're just such a great sleuth, that you've got the owners of Mandalay Bay saying they'll match, give you fund, any of the basic Antifa support groups.
[02:49:48.997 --> 02:49:50.718]  What does your gut tell you about this?
[02:49:50.778 --> 02:49:52.519]  I mean, again, if we saw
[02:49:53.699 --> 02:49:57.546]  A big rap concert shot up by a white guy, you'd think he was a white supremacist.
[02:49:57.566 --> 02:49:58.287]  They would just say that.
[02:49:58.367 --> 02:50:01.532]  Or if a Jewish sinner got attacked, you'd say he's a white supremacist.
[02:50:02.474 --> 02:50:03.616]  Or might be an islamicist.
[02:50:03.656 --> 02:50:06.981]  But just, oh, just ignore all that, even though ISIS is taking credit.
[02:50:07.001 --> 02:50:07.843]  What do you think's happening?
[02:50:08.547 --> 02:50:18.593]  Well, I think that this guy is a hardcore leftist with Antifa connections who became radicalized through ISIS.
[02:50:19.153 --> 02:50:25.497]  And I believe ISIS's claim that they're responsible for this attack because they're claiming that he converted to Islam.
[02:50:25.797 --> 02:50:28.639]  And you see a lot of these leftists that are embracing Islam.
[02:50:28.919 --> 02:50:34.422]  So I think that it has both Antifa and Islamic connections.
[02:50:34.782 --> 02:50:35.823]  I also think that
[02:50:36.523 --> 02:50:40.988]  Well, there's no doubt that there's those, I mean, that's the only thing we've got clear tracks on.
[02:50:41.248 --> 02:50:45.051]  The target, the connections, who took credit, my hostage rescue team.
[02:50:45.292 --> 02:50:48.895]  I mean, I had a former guy that ran CIA operations on yesterday.
[02:50:48.915 --> 02:50:50.416]  I talked to the president sometimes.
[02:50:50.697 --> 02:50:52.238]  It's not like my sources aren't real.
[02:50:52.538 --> 02:50:54.941]  Hell, Matt Drudge gave me the only interview in the last two years.
[02:50:55.381 --> 02:51:00.266]  I have the hostage rescue team telling me the hotel room was full of antifa
[02:51:00.566 --> 02:51:04.351]  And they're pissed because their bosses won't give it out.
[02:51:04.531 --> 02:51:05.212]  We know!
[02:51:05.492 --> 02:51:08.576]  In fact, I'm so conservative, I'm saying we don't!
[02:51:08.817 --> 02:51:11.099]  Well then the hostage rescue team's lying to me!
[02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:16.566]  Well, the same folks told my reporters, get out of here a few days before what happened in...
[02:51:18.809 --> 02:51:19.230]  Oregon!
[02:51:19.450 --> 02:51:20.811]  So these are real sources.
[02:51:20.851 --> 02:51:21.471]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:51:21.752 --> 02:51:35.783]  No, I believe you and I'm in agreement with you and I'm sorry I keep looking at my phone, but I'm getting live time updates from employees who are working inside the MGM resort and they're telling me... And see, we're getting all these too at Real Alex Jones, which is great.
[02:51:35.823 --> 02:51:36.784]  I'm glad Laura's on them.
[02:51:37.145 --> 02:51:37.865]  Look at the tips.
[02:51:37.925 --> 02:51:38.566]  Give us updates.
[02:51:38.626 --> 02:51:39.607]  Laura, tell us what's happening.
[02:51:40.708 --> 02:51:42.029]  So I'm being told that
[02:51:42.975 --> 02:51:50.000]  That the killer was a platinum member, and platinum members tend to have contact, easy contact, with hotel executives.
[02:51:50.301 --> 02:51:59.728]  So it is possible that the shooter, Steven Paddock, had a relationship with Jim Moran, the CEO of MGM Resorts.
[02:51:59.768 --> 02:52:09.435]  And it's also noteworthy that Jim Moran's wife, Heather Moran, I'm reading this from my phone right now from sources, she served in Obama's administration.
[02:52:09.896 --> 02:52:12.558]  So she was an Obama administration employee.
[02:52:13.646 --> 02:52:15.848]  Well, Laura, let me just give you credit here.
[02:52:15.869 --> 02:52:18.592]  I know we've been discussing and talking about you being here at InfoWars.
[02:52:19.012 --> 02:52:27.141]  I think if we hire you, what we need to do is have you in charge of our Twitter sleuthing because we have all these private messages coming in, but you end up getting the documents.
[02:52:27.161 --> 02:52:28.623]  You actually, we have a great crew.
[02:52:28.643 --> 02:52:29.724]  You're the type of folks we need.
[02:52:29.764 --> 02:52:33.909]  I think, I think we just need to go ahead and do it because we've been discussing it and you actually work for InfoWars.
[02:52:34.269 --> 02:52:43.116]  And I think not just your investigative journalism, but how you got the document, obviously, from employees, and now you're talking to them in live time and finding out who's real and getting the documents.
[02:52:43.176 --> 02:52:46.379]  I mean, this is true journalism, what you're engaging in.
[02:52:46.399 --> 02:52:47.039]  Right.
[02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:56.427]  And one more thing that also just, you know, gives more evidence to the ISIS connection is an employee who works for Mandalay told me that she went to the
[02:52:59.389 --> 02:53:01.391]  To the union offices, right?
[02:53:01.571 --> 02:53:04.835]  And all of the doors are plastered with those.
[02:53:04.855 --> 02:53:10.320]  Do you remember those refuse fascism signs with the woman, the democratic signs with the woman in the hijab?
[02:53:10.380 --> 02:53:10.500]  Yes.
[02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:12.062]  We saw all of those.
[02:53:12.622 --> 02:53:17.087]  Those are plastered all over the union office for MGM casinos.
[02:53:17.327 --> 02:53:18.929]  Oh, do you have photos of that yet?
[02:53:19.804 --> 02:53:24.026]  I'm going to be obtaining photos and I'm going to, you know, release them as soon as I obtain them.
[02:53:24.066 --> 02:53:28.889]  I have multiple sources on the ground, employees of MGM who are sending me information.
[02:53:28.949 --> 02:53:32.691]  There's no doubt, Laura Loomer, I don't know how you do it.
[02:53:33.011 --> 02:53:35.833]  I'm not kissing your butt, but this is what journalists used to do.
[02:53:36.213 --> 02:53:39.355]  What she's doing, working sources, this is incredible.
[02:53:39.795 --> 02:53:41.156]  Michael Snyder, final comments.
[02:53:42.492 --> 02:53:47.214]  Yeah, but the mainstream media, they're not doing their job, and you know, this doesn't fit their narrative.
[02:53:47.234 --> 02:53:48.335]  So they don't want to talk about it.
[02:53:48.355 --> 02:53:50.836]  They don't want to talk about a connection to Antifa.
[02:53:50.876 --> 02:53:56.639]  They shot up a bunch of people in a country deal at a big liberal casino, and they were walking into a trap.
[02:53:56.719 --> 02:53:57.500]  It's so clear!
[02:53:58.280 --> 02:53:59.441]  Alex, one more thing.
[02:53:59.581 --> 02:54:05.283]  Just to go off of what the guest is saying, I was undercover in Refuse Fascism, right?
[02:54:05.324 --> 02:54:07.925]  Like, I no longer... You used to work with Project Veritas.
[02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:20.879]  Right, and I was undercover inside the Refused Fascism office, and I know first-hand from being inside their New York office, having access to people like Samsara Taylor and their leaders connected to the RevCom movement.
[02:54:21.179 --> 02:54:24.241]  These people are violent, and they are very passive about violence.
[02:54:24.521 --> 02:54:27.223]  They don't have sympathy for when Trump supporters are attacked.
[02:54:27.524 --> 02:54:29.165]  I had access to their computers.
[02:54:29.645 --> 02:54:31.470]  Okay, I had access to their paperwork.
[02:54:31.790 --> 02:54:33.274]  These people are violent.
[02:54:33.514 --> 02:54:35.318]  These people support Islam.
[02:54:35.559 --> 02:54:39.127]  And these people give an excuse and a total pass for jihadi terror.
[02:54:40.569 --> 02:54:40.809]  Absolutely.
[02:54:40.829 --> 02:54:47.114]  We're going to come back to you for a little bit more, Laura Loomer, after we get a final comment from our guest, Michael Snyder.
[02:54:47.214 --> 02:54:49.876]  I mean, look, the left's been saying the revolution's coming.
[02:54:50.176 --> 02:54:51.857]  They say hashtag cunt Republicans.
[02:54:52.237 --> 02:54:56.780]  CNN, you know, has a friend on of the shooter of Scalise and says he's a hero.
[02:54:57.141 --> 02:55:01.243]  I mean, they really think they're going to have a war and then deny they're doing it while they do it.
[02:55:01.464 --> 02:55:02.865]  Of course they're the suspects.
[02:55:03.105 --> 02:55:04.626]  And then ISIS took credit, Snyder.
[02:55:04.966 --> 02:55:05.566]  I agree with you.
[02:55:05.607 --> 02:55:08.909]  And the video in Reno looks exactly, let's roll that behind me.
[02:55:09.349 --> 02:55:14.535]  Yeah, it absolutely does, Alex.
[02:55:14.555 --> 02:55:18.080]  And we need to understand that they have declared war.
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:19.401]  They want it to be violent.
[02:55:19.441 --> 02:55:20.643]  And so Trump is the target.
[02:55:20.663 --> 02:55:23.346]  We need to pray for him and his family and everyone in his administration.
[02:55:23.646 --> 02:55:25.048]  But Alex, you are a target.
[02:55:25.168 --> 02:55:27.291]  Everyone in your staff, we need to be in prayer for you.
[02:55:27.791 --> 02:55:31.532]  I'm a target because I'm openly saying I want to go to Congress and be Donald Trump's best friend.
[02:55:31.852 --> 02:55:39.594]  And so when the media, when the left figures out who I am, and that I'm a friend of Alex Jones and everything else, I'm going to be the most hated person running for Congress in the entire country.
[02:55:39.774 --> 02:55:40.614]  They're going to come after me.
[02:55:40.874 --> 02:55:41.634]  We're all targets.
[02:55:41.694 --> 02:55:43.235]  We need to understand what we're in for.
[02:55:43.575 --> 02:55:44.815]  But we don't need to be backed down.
[02:55:44.835 --> 02:55:47.136]  This is a time to be brave, to be bold, to stand up.
[02:55:47.336 --> 02:55:49.877]  Because if we don't stand up, the radical left is going to take over.
[02:55:50.137 --> 02:55:51.457]  We can't let that happen.
[02:55:52.403 --> 02:55:54.805]  They believe they've lost politically and they have culturally.
[02:55:54.825 --> 02:55:55.686]  They're going for violence.
[02:55:55.726 --> 02:55:56.606]  They've said they're doing it.
[02:55:56.626 --> 02:55:57.347]  They're making their move.
[02:55:58.688 --> 02:55:59.609]  Yeah, they absolutely do.
[02:55:59.669 --> 02:56:02.932]  In their literature, in their books, everything, they openly embrace violence.
[02:56:02.952 --> 02:56:04.132]  They say, we're going to be violent.
[02:56:04.173 --> 02:56:05.614]  We make no apologies for it.
[02:56:05.854 --> 02:56:13.940]  And when people openly say that, I don't know why the authorities aren't arresting them, but when they openly say we're going to commit violence, that's a huge red flag and we need to watch out.
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:15.281]  It starts November 4th.
[02:56:15.542 --> 02:56:16.743]  It's going to be all over the country.
[02:56:17.083 --> 02:56:18.244]  People need to get ready for this.
[02:56:18.464 --> 02:56:20.226]  And the police said he was known to them.
[02:56:20.626 --> 02:56:26.613]  They need to say, I know they got investigations going, but they need to say, because they use investigations, the government does, to shut down the truth.
[02:56:26.833 --> 02:56:28.515]  Not the police, but the higher-ups.
[02:56:28.815 --> 02:56:30.377]  They need to say why he was known to them.
[02:56:30.417 --> 02:56:36.063]  And you know it's going to be Antifa, because it looks just like him getting in the cop's face on the video.
[02:56:36.163 --> 02:56:39.046]  And I mean, if it isn't him, it's his twin brother.
[02:56:39.827 --> 02:56:39.987]  Woo!
[02:56:41.235 --> 02:56:43.916]  Yeah, Alex, why did it take 72 minutes?
[02:56:44.036 --> 02:56:46.758]  Why was the shooting allowed to continue for 72 minutes?
[02:56:47.138 --> 02:56:48.178]  That boggles my mind.
[02:56:48.198 --> 02:56:48.678]  I don't know.
[02:56:48.899 --> 02:56:53.561]  You know, so much of this looks like a setup, like it was staged.
[02:56:53.641 --> 02:56:56.722]  We should look at the insurance of Mandalay Bay, just like 9-11.
[02:56:57.082 --> 02:56:58.403]  We should look at the insurance of that.
[02:56:59.966 --> 02:57:00.746]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:57:00.766 --> 02:57:05.547]  There are so many unanswered questions that we need questions to, and the mainstream media is dropping the ball.
[02:57:05.787 --> 02:57:08.248]  They don't want to look into this because they're afraid where it might lead.
[02:57:08.268 --> 02:57:08.508]  That's right.
[02:57:08.588 --> 02:57:10.908]  Michael Schneider, TheEconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:57:10.949 --> 02:57:12.629]  MichaelSchneiderForCongress.com.
[02:57:12.669 --> 02:57:13.909]  Get behind him there in Idaho.

[02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:19.070]  Follow her on Twitter.

[02:57:44.792 --> 02:57:45.392]  I'm gonna hire you.
[02:57:45.472 --> 02:57:45.852]  It's done.
[02:57:45.872 --> 02:57:46.793]  Let's just get that going.
[02:57:47.353 --> 02:57:48.653]  And Pasobic 2, everybody.
[02:57:48.853 --> 02:57:50.113]  It's time to go to full war.
[02:57:50.454 --> 02:57:51.514]  Thank you so much, Schneider.
[02:57:51.534 --> 02:57:51.974]  We'll be back.

[02:59:55.054 --> 03:00:00.977]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.546 --> 03:00:13.947]  You're receiving this transmission.
[03:00:14.207 --> 03:00:19.169]  You, not Keith Urban, are the resistance.
[03:00:19.489 --> 03:00:23.430]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:24.470 --> 03:00:29.092]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.064 --> 03:00:32.505]  Revolution in their minds!
[03:00:32.545 --> 03:00:35.166]  The children start to march and they want death.
[03:00:35.226 --> 03:00:35.966]  They are the leftists.
[03:00:36.006 --> 03:00:36.766]  They are upon us.
[03:00:37.246 --> 03:00:39.707]  Laura Loomer is just an incredible investigative journalist.
[03:00:39.727 --> 03:00:46.050]  The way she keeps just ferreting out huge news when she was at Veritas and then at Rebel and now Independent.
[03:00:46.090 --> 03:00:52.232]  The way she's broken this huge news here where we know the Mandalay Bay owners are huge leftist globalists but now
[03:00:53.786 --> 03:01:03.610]  This guy being a Platinum member, the internal documents where they were matching money to groups that Congress is trying to ban as terror groups, Islamist groups.
[03:01:04.130 --> 03:01:10.512]  And then you tie this into Kit Daniels' article and our reporters in Syria about the Antifa working with them here.
[03:01:11.393 --> 03:01:12.673]  I mean, this is serious.
[03:01:12.753 --> 03:01:14.174]  This is a real takeover.
[03:01:15.254 --> 03:01:19.236]  Just like it says in the WikiLeaks where George Soros says, we're going to overthrow Israel.
[03:01:21.078 --> 03:01:22.098]  And the United States in 2017.
[03:01:22.138 --> 03:01:24.979]  They were going to put Hillary in and do it.
[03:01:25.420 --> 03:01:28.641]  This is a total alliance with the Muslims and let's just get it out there.
[03:01:29.101 --> 03:01:30.281]  That doesn't mean all the Muslims.
[03:01:30.301 --> 03:01:32.162]  A lot of Muslims are heretics and trying to get out of it.
[03:01:32.202 --> 03:01:35.483]  But as the cult goes, that's the army of the left.
[03:01:35.523 --> 03:01:36.983]  Laura Loomer, amazing.
[03:01:37.064 --> 03:01:38.264]  Other key points you want to relay?
[03:01:39.537 --> 03:01:47.165]  Well, I would just like to read something, a message that I received from somebody who has direct access to the booking information at the Mandalay.
[03:01:48.066 --> 03:01:50.069]  It's going to take a minute, but it's really important.
[03:01:50.129 --> 03:01:52.671]  So there are two separate rooms that this guy booked.
[03:01:52.731 --> 03:01:56.095]  It's not one room, as the police are trying to say.
[03:01:56.135 --> 03:01:57.317]  They're trying to say that it's a suite.
[03:01:57.357 --> 03:01:59.279]  It's actually two separate rooms.
[03:02:00.020 --> 03:02:08.192]  And you could have booked them at the same time, but the suite had his name on it and the other room had his girlfriend's name on it.
[03:02:08.513 --> 03:02:11.478]  So first we're being told that the girlfriend is in the Philippines.
[03:02:11.818 --> 03:02:14.162]  And then when all of this was happening and they
[03:02:15.203 --> 03:02:17.024]  They released her name as a suspect.
[03:02:17.044 --> 03:02:18.264]  They said that they had detained her.
[03:02:18.565 --> 03:02:22.806]  But then we find out that she's in the Philippines, which, as we know, has a huge ISIS problem right now.
[03:02:22.866 --> 03:02:28.089]  I mean, ISIS has totally taken over the town of Marawi, so the girlfriend has an Islamic angle as well.
[03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:35.672]  There were room changes for, um, and charges for both of the rooms, so they redirected where room service was going.
[03:02:35.972 --> 03:02:40.354]  So that's a big red flag right there, because if he was setting up this, um,
[03:02:40.814 --> 03:02:41.074]  I'm good.
[03:02:56.866 --> 03:03:01.669]  They said typically the room will be taken care of as well if the VIP guests gamble enough on their trip.
[03:03:02.410 --> 03:03:12.357]  Um, it's possible that they had a relationship with the CEO, uh, with him being a platinum, uh... Oh, clearly he was being... clearly whether he's a Patsy or not is a cutout.
[03:03:12.737 --> 03:03:13.898]  He was being protected.
[03:03:13.958 --> 03:03:18.101]  They, standard, when you check in, they come when you leave, they search your crap.
[03:03:18.481 --> 03:03:21.103]  Every time they come, they toss your room like it's a prison.
[03:03:21.544 --> 03:03:22.404]  I mean, five days, 42 weapons?
[03:03:24.966 --> 03:03:26.086]  He was being protected.
[03:03:26.547 --> 03:03:29.048]  Oh, and it's a big George Soros CEO.
[03:03:29.428 --> 03:03:30.508]  Right on time, Laura.
[03:03:31.188 --> 03:03:37.471]  Right, and then also, I don't know if you know this or not, but in the past few weeks, he wired $100,000 to the Philippines.
[03:03:37.511 --> 03:03:41.292]  Why is he wiring $100,000 to a country that's being ravaged by ISIS right now?
[03:03:47.708 --> 03:03:49.709]  Well, it's clear he's getting it.
[03:03:49.729 --> 03:03:52.630]  We know the Islamists will pay a million dollars for something like this.
[03:03:52.650 --> 03:03:52.970]  But who?
[03:03:53.450 --> 03:03:54.611]  Who is getting this money?
[03:03:55.811 --> 03:04:04.295]  $100,000 can pay for a lot of ammunition, a lot of guns, a lot of tannerite, and God knows what else he had in his properties that police are not telling us about.
[03:04:04.315 --> 03:04:06.176]  And they're saying none of this was bought in stores.
[03:04:06.416 --> 03:04:07.936]  He obviously had massive help.
[03:04:07.996 --> 03:04:09.017]  That's the big takeaway.
[03:04:10.137 --> 03:04:13.418]  Yeah, and we know that gun control is not going to stop these people.
[03:04:13.458 --> 03:04:15.738]  Look at the Bataclan in France, for example.
[03:04:15.778 --> 03:04:19.759]  This looks like a replica of the Bataclan attack that took place in Paris.
[03:04:20.079 --> 03:04:34.182]  Paris has very strong and tough gun laws, and those mass-murderer, jihadi terrorists were able to get enough ammunition to, you know, open fire on hundreds of people inside a concert hall and injure, what was it, or kill, what, 130 people?
[03:04:34.282 --> 03:04:35.583]  How many people died in Bataclan?
[03:04:35.603 --> 03:04:36.783]  The Eagles of Death.
[03:04:37.503 --> 03:04:41.506]  Please, coming up in about 55 minutes, we're going to start the war room.
[03:04:42.307 --> 03:04:46.370]  And I'd love you to host an hour of that with the crew to be able to lay all your evidence out.
[03:04:47.010 --> 03:04:48.872]  You know, send them via text.
[03:04:49.733 --> 03:04:50.773]  All the latest stuff.
[03:04:50.813 --> 03:04:51.954]  You're working these sources.
[03:04:52.315 --> 03:04:53.596]  You're breaking major news.
[03:04:54.056 --> 03:04:56.258]  At Laura Loomer on Twitter, folks, if you've got tips.
[03:04:56.618 --> 03:04:59.020]  We've got tips flooding in, but we're not able to, I guess, go over them.
[03:04:59.100 --> 03:04:59.540]  She is.
[03:05:00.081 --> 03:05:00.981]  One man wrecking crew.
[03:05:01.021 --> 03:05:01.762]  Great job, lady.
[03:05:04.318 --> 03:05:09.221]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[03:05:10.022 --> 03:05:12.944]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[03:05:13.624 --> 03:05:16.426]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[03:05:17.047 --> 03:05:21.930]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[03:05:22.290 --> 03:05:28.574]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[03:05:28.954 --> 03:05:34.078]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[03:05:34.778 --> 03:05:38.199]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[03:05:38.779 --> 03:05:46.601]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[03:05:47.161 --> 03:05:51.502]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[03:05:51.842 --> 03:05:55.783]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[03:05:56.083 --> 03:05:59.884]  Stay in the game with Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.
[03:06:00.144 --> 03:06:01.825]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:16.468 --> 03:06:20.672]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[03:06:20.932 --> 03:06:26.837]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:27.778 --> 03:06:30.320]  You still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[03:06:32.722 --> 03:06:34.864]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[03:06:36.345 --> 03:06:41.310]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[03:06:41.630 --> 03:06:43.592]  This story does not add up.
[03:07:12.426 --> 03:07:18.372]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was almost a minute late getting back on air because we are doing a lot of behind-the-scenes big breaking news here.
[03:07:18.392 --> 03:07:28.662]  Paul Watson is going to take over in this hour and we're going to just have continued breaking news at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:07:30.043 --> 03:07:36.229]  We've got major Islamic connections, leftist connections, the hotel owners being Antifa.
[03:07:37.531 --> 03:07:39.013]  This guy being totally protected.
[03:07:39.073 --> 03:07:41.978]  ABC News reports 42 guns taken in there.
[03:07:42.018 --> 03:07:45.724]  Diverting room service and cleaning into the other suite for five days.
[03:07:46.105 --> 03:07:47.647]  They don't let you do that in hotels.
[03:07:48.914 --> 03:07:49.134]  Okay.
[03:07:50.095 --> 03:07:52.796]  I mean, you go in, they dig through your stuff as soon as you leave the first time.
[03:07:54.937 --> 03:07:58.898]  My bodyguard before, and he's licensed to carry there, they didn't see his license.
[03:07:58.918 --> 03:08:01.239]  So within an hour, he went downstairs to eat.
[03:08:01.279 --> 03:08:03.740]  They already got in the room, found his handgun.
[03:08:03.760 --> 03:08:04.781]  He gets there, it's gone.
[03:08:05.001 --> 03:08:06.741]  They go come downstairs, the police are waiting.
[03:08:07.202 --> 03:08:08.002]  I mean, that's Vegas.
[03:08:08.062 --> 03:08:10.163]  They are watching everything.
[03:08:11.061 --> 03:08:15.382]  And so they're now demonizing the Second Amendment, a full frontal assault.
[03:08:15.822 --> 03:08:16.542]  This is incredible.
[03:08:16.562 --> 03:08:18.082]  I'm going to turn this over to Paul Watson.
[03:08:18.422 --> 03:08:21.203]  Then in about 52 minutes, the war room starts.
[03:08:21.263 --> 03:08:24.304]  Laura Limmer will be back on with breaking news and a lot more.
[03:08:24.344 --> 03:08:28.564]  But Paul Joseph Watson of PrisonPlanet.com is taking over here.
[03:08:28.604 --> 03:08:31.525]  Just briefly, we are listener and viewer supported.
[03:08:31.545 --> 03:08:32.625]  We're under massive attack.
[03:08:32.665 --> 03:08:33.305]  I'm not complaining.
[03:08:33.345 --> 03:08:33.925]  I asked for it.
[03:08:34.326 --> 03:08:36.246]  I'm just saying if you want to help us win this fight,
[03:08:37.186 --> 03:08:40.788]  Now more than ever, InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:08:51.313 --> 03:08:54.195]  When I take this during the day, I end up getting tired or up before I go to bed at night.
[03:08:54.235 --> 03:08:55.035]  I even sleep better.
[03:08:55.315 --> 03:08:56.676]  Gives you great energy during the day.

[03:10:07.542 --> 03:10:13.425]  But you make the Info War possible, as well as our sponsors, our affiliates, and of course this great crew.
[03:10:13.505 --> 03:10:16.307]  But, Paul Watson's latest article.
[03:10:17.858 --> 03:10:21.742]  Forensic psychologist says, hey, it's a bunch of right-wingers.
[03:10:22.243 --> 03:10:23.404]  Leftists would target that.
[03:10:23.444 --> 03:10:24.766]  That's your first big clue.
[03:10:25.066 --> 03:10:26.027]  What I keep hammering.
[03:10:26.248 --> 03:10:27.890]  Then ISIS takes responsibility.
[03:10:28.110 --> 03:10:30.112]  When they normally do that, that means they're behind it.
[03:10:30.573 --> 03:10:33.716]  The left claiming in Newsweek that I made it up.
[03:10:33.836 --> 03:10:36.379]  Jones claims ISIS took responsibility when they didn't.
[03:10:37.028 --> 03:10:38.249]  That was the headline yesterday.
[03:10:38.949 --> 03:10:40.230]  Jones blames Deep State.
[03:10:40.771 --> 03:10:47.015]  This type of desperate behavior, them claiming this big violent launch was coming on October 1st.
[03:10:47.055 --> 03:10:48.356]  This is all critical.
[03:10:48.896 --> 03:10:58.723]  And it's critical for you to get these articles out on Facebook and Twitter and your email and by hand and local talk shows because we're in an info war.
[03:10:59.644 --> 03:11:04.087]  I now take you to London where Paul Watson will host the balance of the transmission.
[03:11:04.347 --> 03:11:04.808]  Paul Watson.
[03:11:06.604 --> 03:11:07.204]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:11:07.284 --> 03:11:08.505]  Yes, we are here live.
[03:11:08.545 --> 03:11:09.926]  We have a video clip coming up.
[03:11:10.066 --> 03:11:11.667]  In fact, let me know when you've got that ready.
[03:11:12.048 --> 03:11:16.410]  As Alex just discussed, a big article went up on Infowars.com about an hour ago.
[03:11:16.491 --> 03:11:21.594]  Forensic psychiatrists suggest gunmen may have deliberately targeted conservatives
[03:11:22.364 --> 03:11:24.605]  This is Dr. Michael Wellner.
[03:11:24.645 --> 03:11:26.725]  He went on Fox & Friends this morning.
[03:11:27.265 --> 03:11:32.386]  Made the point, as Alex just said, and it's a point that we made in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.
[03:11:32.406 --> 03:11:46.549]  Oh, and by the way, two hours before the shooting, as you can see right now up on Infowars.com as well, the audience was singing, along with the people on stage, God Bless America, two hours before the shooting began.
[03:11:47.169 --> 03:11:50.050]  Now this forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Wellner,
[03:11:51.221 --> 03:11:52.442]  Laid it out on Fox News.
[03:11:52.462 --> 03:12:05.932]  He made the point that people who commit these kind of stranger mass homicides, when they don't know the victims, it's not workplace violence, it's a mass homicide attack, it's not an attack on somebody's family, they don't know the victims.
[03:12:06.552 --> 03:12:15.499]  When they do it for notoriety, there you see the crowd at the Country Music Festival singing God Bless America two hours before the attack.
[03:12:16.639 --> 03:12:20.002]  Now the psychiatrist made the point, and we're going to go to this clip in a minute here,
[03:12:21.576 --> 03:12:29.100]  When young people carry out terror attacks or mass shooting attacks, and we have it ready, we'll go to it in a second, they do it for one of two reasons.
[03:12:29.161 --> 03:12:34.224]  It's either for notoriety or in pursuit of a political or personal cause.
[03:12:34.604 --> 03:12:36.865]  In almost every single example.
[03:12:37.425 --> 03:12:41.328]  The ones who do it for notoriety are almost always young men.
[03:12:41.348 --> 03:12:42.769]  This was not a young man.
[03:12:42.829 --> 03:12:44.309]  What was he, 64 years old?
[03:12:45.310 --> 03:12:46.871]  Why would he do it for notoriety?
[03:12:46.891 --> 03:12:47.812]  It makes no sense.
[03:12:47.832 --> 03:12:48.272]  There's no
[03:12:49.204 --> 03:12:50.987]  Hint of mental illness.
[03:12:51.027 --> 03:12:57.557]  He was doing it for political power to trigger a helter-skelter Charlie Manson style race war system.
[03:12:59.280 --> 03:13:03.386]  Let's go to the video Alex because he lays it out on his appearance with Fox and Friends.
[03:13:03.406 --> 03:13:04.168]  Let's go to the clip.
[03:13:05.251 --> 03:13:05.511]  Uh-huh.
[03:13:05.551 --> 03:13:06.452]  I don't buy this guy.
[03:13:35.086 --> 03:13:40.429]  So what goes on in the mind of a shooter like this as they shoot at innocent people?
[03:13:40.689 --> 03:13:43.030]  Here now to discuss this is Dr. Michael Wellner.
[03:13:43.070 --> 03:13:48.172]  He's a top forensic psychiatrist who has personally examined a number of mass killers.
[03:13:48.392 --> 03:13:49.553]  Doctor, thank you for being with us.
[03:13:49.573 --> 03:13:50.313]  Good morning.
[03:13:50.393 --> 03:13:50.894]  What happened?
[03:13:50.934 --> 03:13:51.614]  What's going on here?
[03:13:51.874 --> 03:13:56.937]  Well, if you want to understand the killer, the most important place to start is with the victims.
[03:13:57.357 --> 03:14:02.479]  And what we can immediately see is that he had no relationship to the killers.
[03:14:02.699 --> 03:14:06.021]  A workplace mass shooter knows his victims.
[03:14:06.141 --> 03:14:07.342]  And they want to see the victim, right?
[03:14:07.362 --> 03:14:09.683]  And they want to destroy, annihilate the workplace.
[03:14:09.703 --> 03:14:10.843]  That's another key point.
[03:14:11.384 --> 03:14:14.505]  The family mass shooter knows the family, wants to annihilate the family.
[03:14:14.585 --> 03:14:17.427]  The criminal enterprise wants to kill the gang.
[03:14:18.007 --> 03:14:19.828]  So it's a stranger mass homicide.
[03:14:20.248 --> 03:14:23.071]  And a stranger mass homicide happens for one of two reasons.
[03:14:23.511 --> 03:14:32.040]  Either a person acting for a cause, or a person acting because he wants to transcend notoriety and kill as many people as possible, like a James Holmes.
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:34.622]  However... James Holmes, who was the Aurora shooter?
[03:14:34.642 --> 03:14:35.883]  Who was the Aurora shooter.
[03:14:35.943 --> 03:14:36.984]  And you worked on that case?
[03:14:37.164 --> 03:14:37.345]  Yes.
[03:14:38.499 --> 03:14:39.239]  Here's the thing.
[03:14:40.260 --> 03:14:45.063]  Shooting for notoriety's sake and nothing more is a young man's crime.
[03:14:45.483 --> 03:14:51.947]  And this is a 64-year-old with no dramatic mental illness, no major decline, someone who's intact.
[03:14:52.047 --> 03:14:56.170]  I think if we want to understand what's behind the crime, we should look at James Hodgkinson.
[03:14:56.630 --> 03:15:05.435]  The shooter of Congressman Scalise, because that crime itself was intended to be a spectacle and of much bigger scope.
[03:15:05.475 --> 03:15:06.075]  Imagine this.
[03:15:06.535 --> 03:15:11.738]  What he intended to do, Hodgkinson, was not only kill all of those lawmakers, but
[03:15:12.418 --> 03:15:28.042]  But in doing so, we would have had to have special elections to replace all of them, and if it weren't for the security people who intercepted him, you had all kinds of congressmen and lawmakers in a dugout, defenseless, who would have been mowed down.
[03:15:28.682 --> 03:15:32.383]  My point is, a spectacle is either designed to cause something...
[03:15:32.523 --> 03:15:35.264]  This guy, Dr. Michael Wellner, is incredible.
[03:15:35.725 --> 03:15:37.105]  He's saying everything I've been saying.
[03:15:37.145 --> 03:15:39.907]  Paul, I'm going to turn this back over to you, but let's back this up 30 seconds.
[03:15:40.307 --> 03:15:44.589]  Let's come back about a minute and finish this clip out of break, and then Paul is taking over.
[03:15:44.629 --> 03:15:47.710]  This video, this article Paul has done, is the key to everything.
[03:15:48.070 --> 03:15:52.112]  An expert who's been involved in all this, telling you exactly what I told you.
[03:15:52.453 --> 03:15:55.354]  I told you this is a leftist, globalist attack.
[03:15:55.394 --> 03:15:56.575]  The media is playing dumb.
[03:15:56.915 --> 03:15:58.836]  We'll be right back with Paul Watson.
[03:15:58.876 --> 03:15:59.316]  Stay with us.

[03:19:01.630 --> 03:19:05.154]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[03:19:05.614 --> 03:19:11.660]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[03:19:12.081 --> 03:19:14.864]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:15.244 --> 03:19:18.247]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:19:18.447 --> 03:19:21.891]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[03:19:22.231 --> 03:19:22.692]  The left
[03:19:23.032 --> 03:19:23.973]  ...controls culture.
[03:19:23.993 --> 03:19:24.974]  They control arts.
[03:19:25.034 --> 03:19:26.275]  They control entertainment.
[03:19:26.575 --> 03:19:33.662]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:19:33.702 --> 03:19:36.124]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[03:19:36.605 --> 03:19:40.469]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[03:19:40.509 --> 03:19:42.590]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate...
[03:19:43.211 --> 03:19:48.572]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[03:19:48.832 --> 03:19:55.074]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[03:19:55.154 --> 03:19:56.855]  It will make me incredibly happy.

[03:20:06.797 --> 03:20:09.438]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.940 --> 03:20:25.541]  We're live!
[03:20:27.442 --> 03:20:36.807]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:37.027 --> 03:20:38.748]  We're going to go back to that video in a second.
[03:20:38.788 --> 03:20:40.829]  This is a top forensic psychiatrist.
[03:20:41.534 --> 03:20:44.017]  Who worked on the James Holmes shooting, of course.
[03:20:44.197 --> 03:20:47.420]  That motive was mainly for him to gain notoriety.
[03:20:47.460 --> 03:20:49.542]  Of course, mental illness was involved as well.
[03:20:49.923 --> 03:20:51.524]  The Batman shooter, of course.
[03:20:52.105 --> 03:20:53.967]  Now he's gone on Fox News this morning.
[03:20:54.007 --> 03:20:56.069]  He's saying basically, and he'll lay it out.
[03:20:56.089 --> 03:20:57.991]  We're going to play the clip, the rest of it in a sec.
[03:20:58.729 --> 03:21:07.977]  Look, this was a country music concert, this was an attack on Americana, this was an attack on gun owners who have been dehumanized and demonized by the media.
[03:21:08.237 --> 03:21:13.421]  At the end of the clip he outright says that CNN bears some responsibility for this shooting.
[03:21:13.922 --> 03:21:20.467]  Again, if you want to ask whether he was more likely radicalized by ISIS or CNN, at the moment it's looking like CNN.
[03:21:20.507 --> 03:21:22.589]  Of course we wait for more information to come in.
[03:21:22.909 --> 03:21:24.411]  Let's go to the rest of this clip though.
[03:21:24.451 --> 03:21:24.691]  This is
[03:21:25.192 --> 03:21:29.092]  Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Michael Wellner on Fox News this morning.
[03:21:29.132 --> 03:21:29.514]  Here it is.
[03:21:30.871 --> 03:21:31.611]  Here's the thing.
[03:21:32.632 --> 03:21:37.434]  Shooting for notoriety's sake, and nothing more, is a young man's crime.
[03:21:37.855 --> 03:21:44.318]  And this is a 64-year-old with no dramatic mental illness, no major decline, someone who's intact.
[03:21:44.418 --> 03:21:55.704]  I think if we want to understand what's behind the crime, we should look at James Hodgkinson, the shooter of Congressman Scalise, because that crime itself was intended to be a spectacle
[03:21:56.104 --> 03:21:57.806]  And of much bigger scope.
[03:21:57.846 --> 03:21:58.446]  Imagine this.
[03:21:58.907 --> 03:22:04.692]  What he intended to do, Hodgkinson, was not only kill all of those lawmakers... Republicans.
[03:22:04.793 --> 03:22:09.097]  But in doing so, we would have had to have special elections to replace all of them.
[03:22:09.617 --> 03:22:20.388]  And if it weren't for the security people who intercepted him, you had all kinds of congressmen and lawmakers in a dugout, defenseless, who would have been mowed down.
[03:22:21.048 --> 03:22:29.532]  My point is, a spectacle is either designed to cause some derivative impact, or to instigate some cause discussion.
[03:22:29.712 --> 03:22:36.556]  So the point is, he's an older man, there's no definable mental history or decline, and yet it happens now.
[03:22:37.336 --> 03:22:45.743]  Now, if there is a cause, there will be a manifesto, there will be a communication with the television, or other kind of media, or social media, it will be out there.
[03:22:46.183 --> 03:22:51.287]  If there's nothing to necessarily tie him to a cause, then instigating is enough.
[03:22:51.387 --> 03:22:59.714]  And that's exactly what the parallel is with another older man's crime, Hodgkinson, spectacle crime, just like the person who flew a plane into the IRS.
[03:23:00.234 --> 03:23:04.418]  People who commit crimes for notoriety alone are young, and he's not.
[03:23:04.999 --> 03:23:05.882]  What about genetics?
[03:23:06.243 --> 03:23:09.373]  Because his dad was on the FBI most wanted list, was a bank robber.
[03:23:10.051 --> 03:23:20.358]  Well, the genetics of psychopathy are, you know, of course, 50% we inherit roughly, but in terms of the genetics of psychopathy, they may be as important as environment.
[03:23:20.978 --> 03:23:24.781]  One thing that you'll want to appreciate about the... Doctor, just hold on one second.
[03:23:24.801 --> 03:23:26.502]  I'm splitting the stream with the President of the United States.
[03:23:26.562 --> 03:23:30.645]  He's arriving at Joint Base Andrews, and he's going to be heading over to Puerto Rico shortly.
[03:23:30.665 --> 03:23:35.248]  Of course, you know, he greets the military who escorts him over to Air Force One.
[03:23:36.108 --> 03:23:36.989]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:23:37.029 --> 03:23:43.772]  Tying into the President, people who commit mass killings of folks that they don't know have to be detached.
[03:23:43.892 --> 03:23:46.914]  And these detached, these many floors away, he's killing them through a scope.
[03:23:47.174 --> 03:23:48.135]  They're dehumanized.
[03:23:48.555 --> 03:23:52.817]  Here's the big take home in terms of what we can do to prevent.
[03:23:54.018 --> 03:24:01.302]  Absolutely, people who are gun enthusiasts and who are populists or nationalists in this country are dehumanized.
[03:24:01.682 --> 03:24:02.423]  They're demonized.
[03:24:03.803 --> 03:24:05.544]  I travel all over the United States.
[03:24:05.924 --> 03:24:06.964]  I don't experience hatred.
[03:24:07.444 --> 03:24:13.426]  I turn on the television, in certain media, and I see these people demonized.
[03:24:13.626 --> 03:24:22.408]  When you have a CBS News executive who talks about not having sympathy, the point is, his mindset is that they deserve to die.
[03:24:22.588 --> 03:24:22.828]  Yes.
[03:24:22.908 --> 03:24:31.291]  And so a person who adopts a cause may be otherwise law-abiding, but he feels righteously justified that the end justifies the means.
[03:24:31.552 --> 03:24:36.594]  So we're talking now about gun control because he committed an over-the-top gun crime.
[03:24:36.794 --> 03:24:38.534]  Doesn't mean that guns was the ideology.
[03:24:38.554 --> 03:24:43.896]  What I'm saying is it's the idea of instigating and a means to an end with people you dehumanize.
[03:24:43.917 --> 03:24:45.517]  Whether it's this or racism.
[03:24:45.537 --> 03:24:46.397]  Who are you shooting at?
[03:24:46.878 --> 03:24:49.739]  You said look at the target and work your way backwards.
[03:24:49.779 --> 03:24:50.159]  That's right.
[03:24:50.219 --> 03:24:53.762]  What do country music fans and country music artists represent?
[03:24:54.062 --> 03:24:54.843]  It's Americana.
[03:24:55.904 --> 03:24:56.645]  It could be Guns.
[03:24:57.125 --> 03:24:59.007]  I'm not suggesting that I know the ideology.
[03:24:59.067 --> 03:25:01.449]  Look, it could be that he had an issue with Las Vegas.
[03:25:01.489 --> 03:25:04.331]  But my point is because this is, you know, this is a national event.
[03:25:04.351 --> 03:25:05.032]  It's in Las Vegas.
[03:25:05.052 --> 03:25:11.157]  But my point is, cause is pointed out by what he says.
[03:25:11.758 --> 03:25:13.719]  He's going to either lay it out or
[03:25:14.400 --> 03:25:16.381]  He's smart enough to know what this would instigate.
[03:25:16.481 --> 03:25:18.162]  Otherwise, one can't speculate.
[03:25:18.202 --> 03:25:25.407]  What I am saying is, when you kill complete strangers, and try to kill as many as possible, you're trying to create a spectacle.
[03:25:25.547 --> 03:25:33.432]  And when you're not a young person, you've evolved past the immaturity that says, if I kill as many people as I can, people will think I'm somebody.
[03:25:33.832 --> 03:25:34.753]  He's more mature than that.
[03:25:34.933 --> 03:25:43.616]  Jeff Zeleny says that this is country music fans for the most part are Republican and the president by showing this type of sympathy is doing something for his base.
[03:25:43.696 --> 03:25:46.737]  Is he a country music fan symbolic of Republicans?
[03:25:47.077 --> 03:25:53.340]  Well I think that CNN is going to have to answer for how they demonize gun enthusiasts and how CNN actually contributes to mass shooting.
[03:25:54.340 --> 03:25:55.460]  And I believe that they do.
[03:25:55.860 --> 03:25:57.001]  But that's a side issue.
[03:25:57.321 --> 03:26:02.943]  I think, look, the president has a responsibility anytime there's a national disaster, whether it's here or whether it's Puerto Rico,
[03:26:03.764 --> 03:26:05.566]  I think that's the end of it.
[03:26:06.206 --> 03:26:16.637]  That is Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Michael Welner on Fox and Friends this morning basically making the point this was not done, whatever motive, was not done for notoriety.
[03:26:16.677 --> 03:26:19.500]  The guy's 64 years old, it just doesn't happen.
[03:26:19.901 --> 03:26:23.044]  He's worked on these cases before, he worked on the James Holmes case.
[03:26:23.625 --> 03:26:25.667]  He's saying this was obviously in pursuit
[03:26:26.451 --> 03:26:30.514]  It's the only explanation left that it's in pursuit of a political or personal cause.
[03:26:30.534 --> 03:26:35.178]  We don't know of any mental illness problems with this shooter.
[03:26:35.218 --> 03:26:37.240]  Whether that emerges later remains to be seen.
[03:26:37.680 --> 03:26:40.422]  But again, look at the Target, a country music festival.
[03:26:40.683 --> 03:26:43.185]  They're singing God Bless America two hours before.
[03:26:43.625 --> 03:26:48.789]  Some of them, according to one eyewitness, get a warning 45 minutes before the shooting begins.
[03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:51.431]  Who goes to a country music concert?
[03:26:51.451 --> 03:26:55.875]  That was why the... I mean, I satirise to some extent the people who were
[03:26:56.730 --> 03:27:15.554]  Blaming this on white supremacism and saying that this was the white supremacist patriarchy's fault, because yeah, yeah, that's the first people I'd target if I were a white supremacist, is a country music concert full of Republican Trump supporters, mainly the ones who were political, and of course white people.
[03:27:16.074 --> 03:27:17.514]  Makes absolutely no sense.
[03:27:17.554 --> 03:27:18.715]  We still don't know the motive.
[03:27:19.115 --> 03:27:22.495]  Nearly two days after this, we know very little about it.
[03:27:22.915 --> 03:27:28.596]  They've dug up some voter registration thing out of Florida from 1984 with his name.
[03:27:29.236 --> 03:27:30.397]  Registered Democrat.
[03:27:30.437 --> 03:27:30.877]  Is it him?
[03:27:30.917 --> 03:27:31.437]  We don't know.
[03:27:31.897 --> 03:27:33.297]  There's no confirmation of anything.
[03:27:33.337 --> 03:27:38.738]  There's a lot of disinformation that's coming out of both the mainstream media and the alternative media.
[03:27:38.758 --> 03:27:40.739]  That's why we need to be very careful about these things.
[03:27:40.799 --> 03:27:43.099]  In fact, some websites yesterday
[03:27:44.122 --> 03:27:47.923]  Named a person as the shooter was a completely innocent person.
[03:27:47.963 --> 03:27:57.247]  So you have to be very careful with these things because again, they found his social media profile and it fitted into who they wanted the shooter to be.
[03:27:57.827 --> 03:27:59.468]  So they just said this guy's the shooter.
[03:28:00.028 --> 03:28:01.368]  That's going to get them in hot water.
[03:28:01.408 --> 03:28:04.590]  It's certainly dismantled their credibility to some extent.
[03:28:04.610 --> 03:28:06.390]  So you got to be careful about these things.
[03:28:06.951 --> 03:28:07.971]  But again, we know nothing.
[03:28:08.920 --> 03:28:10.781]  New York Post has a headline that just went up.
[03:28:11.322 --> 03:28:14.864]  Las Vegas gunman filmed himself during slaughter.
[03:28:15.424 --> 03:28:20.888]  We know he filmed or he had some surveillance set up that allowed him to see when the police were coming.
[03:28:21.508 --> 03:28:32.376]  Now we find out Las Vegas madman Steven Paddock set up a camera inside his hotel room to capture his deadly shooting rampage and other surveillance in the hallway to alert him as cops closed in.
[03:28:32.816 --> 03:28:35.858]  The shooter had at least one lens set up to tape himself
[03:28:36.784 --> 03:28:43.208]  As he unleashed hell on thousands of unsuspecting concertgoers several hundred yards below his ritzy casino suite.
[03:28:43.608 --> 03:28:48.230]  So again, why would he be filming himself carrying out this attack, knowing that he's about to die?
[03:28:48.971 --> 03:28:49.811]  What was that for?
[03:28:49.891 --> 03:28:52.073]  It was obviously because he wanted it to be discovered.
[03:28:52.233 --> 03:28:54.954]  Why did he want the footage to be discovered?
[03:28:55.254 --> 03:28:56.795]  What is the motive?
[03:28:57.075 --> 03:28:58.416]  We still don't know.
[03:28:58.456 --> 03:28:58.996]  We'll be back.
[03:28:59.037 --> 03:29:00.217]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:29:00.818 --> 03:29:01.358]  Don't go away.

[03:30:11.178 --> 03:30:18.280]  Brandon Tatum, last time I checked, like 50-something million views in just four or five days on his Facebook channel.
[03:30:18.700 --> 03:30:35.984]  But this is what's exciting, as the silent majority of every color, we're all the same race, the human race, all red blood, all want freedom for our children, all want a future, unless we're globalist, I guess, speaking out and just exploding and getting now I guess over 100,000 followers on Facebook, and they haven't banned him yet.
[03:30:36.004 --> 03:30:38.925]  Instead of me asking the questions, what finally got you to go public?
[03:30:39.645 --> 03:30:43.427]  What finally got you to start speaking out like so many other silent majority people?
[03:30:43.527 --> 03:30:44.127]  I don't know, man.
[03:30:44.167 --> 03:30:48.049]  I feel like that I have an obligation to people.
[03:30:48.089 --> 03:30:49.630]  I have an obligation to this country.
[03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:53.712]  I have an obligation to my family to just keep it 100% real.
[03:30:54.272 --> 03:30:57.134]  And I felt like that when truth is revealed to me,
[03:30:57.874 --> 03:31:11.163]  I mean I would be doing a disservice to people to not express that and also the frustration is what caused me to start coming out because I couldn't hold it in anymore that I felt like I've been lied to and now the truth has been revealed.
[03:31:11.764 --> 03:31:13.785]  I have to say something about it at all costs.
[03:31:14.305 --> 03:31:15.906]  Like I tell people, it's not about me.
[03:31:15.926 --> 03:31:18.347]  It's not that I'm such a great spokesperson.
[03:31:18.708 --> 03:31:24.151]  It's that God has put me in a position to have a platform to speak on behalf of other people.
[03:31:24.531 --> 03:31:29.714]  And I think that America spoke by a guy sitting in the car, you know,
[03:31:31.055 --> 03:31:37.038]  He's spewing out his heart in millions and millions of shares of that one video.
[03:31:37.158 --> 03:31:39.159]  It speaks to what America really feels.
[03:31:39.319 --> 03:31:43.221]  They have red carpets and Oscars for movies that 10 million people see.
[03:31:43.641 --> 03:31:47.963]  And so I'm just showing how obsolete they are now that all this competition has come.
[03:31:48.244 --> 03:31:49.644]  And then that's only one part of the story.
[03:31:49.924 --> 03:31:52.326]  Then there's the whole story about what you said.
[03:31:52.826 --> 03:31:56.928]  And then the NFL is trying to double down, even though at first they said, OK, we may back off.
[03:31:57.328 --> 03:31:58.609]  Now they want to double down.
[03:31:59.549 --> 03:32:05.838]  I don't know what they're thinking.
[03:32:05.978 --> 03:32:09.903]  I don't know if this is some kamikaze mission or what.
[03:32:10.584 --> 03:32:13.288]  I think what it is, is the liberal mentality.
[03:32:13.308 --> 03:32:15.150]  I feel like that these people are being
[03:32:16.131 --> 03:32:21.895]  You know, tricked into, brainwashed into, forced into, shamed into acting this way.
[03:32:22.055 --> 03:32:32.161]  I think a few players decided to do something, and these owners are afraid of the backlash that they'll get from minority communities if they actually stand up for what's right.
[03:32:32.782 --> 03:32:34.683]  I have no idea what they're thinking about.
[03:32:34.723 --> 03:32:36.524]  This should not be happening in America.
[03:32:36.664 --> 03:32:39.686]  Brandon Tatum is our guest, police officer Patriot.
[03:32:40.703 --> 03:32:43.585]  The Officer Tatum on Twitter, Facebook, TatumBug34.
[03:32:44.006 --> 03:32:46.608]  And that's where you go see 13 million views.
[03:32:46.968 --> 03:32:50.390]  Got other channels, 5 million here, 2 million there, 42 million here.
[03:32:50.411 --> 03:32:52.432]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[03:32:52.492 --> 03:32:53.813]  And again, that's just one of his videos.
[03:32:54.093 --> 03:32:55.174]  The other videos have millions.
[03:32:55.695 --> 03:32:57.396]  That shows folks love that truth.
[03:32:57.716 --> 03:32:58.196]  We'll be back.
[03:33:06.803 --> 03:33:09.445]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.119 --> 03:33:22.749]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.149 --> 03:33:26.834]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:30.734 --> 03:33:33.796]  We are live on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.836 --> 03:33:44.301]  Before we get back into this breaking news about the massacre in Las Vegas and some other stories, I want to tell you about some of the products we've got on offer at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:34:02.745 --> 03:34:05.146]  I use it as well, and it really does work.
[03:34:05.206 --> 03:34:06.087]  It gives you a boost.
[03:34:06.147 --> 03:34:07.427]  It helps mental clarity.
[03:34:07.447 --> 03:34:11.409]  It doesn't give you that junk buzz that you get off coffee after drinking coffee.

[03:34:16.711 --> 03:34:17.731]  It really does help.

[03:34:36.641 --> 03:34:39.482]  Again, InfoWarsStore.com for a limited time.

[03:34:53.566 --> 03:34:54.986]  BuzzFeed doesn't want you to get it.
[03:34:55.686 --> 03:34:58.467]  That's a pretty good reason in and of itself to get it.
[03:34:58.547 --> 03:35:05.349]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com, as is the Emerix Essentials, of course.

[03:35:42.399 --> 03:35:43.600]  Get it today!
[03:35:45.201 --> 03:35:53.688]  Let's go back to some news stories about this horrendous tragedy in Las Vegas on Sunday night, about which we still know very little indeed.
[03:35:54.838 --> 03:35:58.241]  Of course, today we had some photos of the guns that were in the hotel room.
[03:35:58.281 --> 03:36:06.569]  We had, of course, the gruesome picture of the gunman himself, dead, reportedly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, before the cops arrived.
[03:36:07.369 --> 03:36:08.430]  That's basically all we know.
[03:36:08.450 --> 03:36:14.055]  We've got some suspicious financial transactions, but no real motive as of this time.
[03:36:15.457 --> 03:36:20.121]  I mean, surely, given the planning, given the deadly nature of this,
[03:36:21.133 --> 03:36:23.354]  This wasn't someone who just went postal on a whim.
[03:36:23.374 --> 03:36:26.715]  There has to be some kind of motive behind this, or maybe there isn't.
[03:36:26.735 --> 03:36:34.758]  I mean, people search for meaning to try and cope with horrendous tragedies like that, to try and make some sense of it.
[03:36:35.198 --> 03:36:37.199]  Maybe it is completely senseless.
[03:36:37.759 --> 03:36:39.740]  I mean, that still remains a possibility.
[03:36:40.405 --> 03:36:50.730]  Remember the Charles Whitman shooting, the Texas UT Tower shooting way back in 1966, which of course bears some similarities to this.
[03:36:51.070 --> 03:36:53.711]  You know, the sniper's nest from a high vantage point.
[03:36:54.192 --> 03:36:57.293]  That was America's deadliest mass shooting for a very long time.
[03:36:57.693 --> 03:36:58.474]  I think it was about 16 dead.
[03:37:00.263 --> 03:37:06.765]  In the UT Tower shooting, Charles Whitman, of course, there was no political or religious motive behind that.
[03:37:06.825 --> 03:37:11.186]  He was basically somebody with mental health problems, complained of headaches.
[03:37:11.866 --> 03:37:15.407]  I guess the treatments for that weren't really that sophisticated back in 1966.
[03:37:17.127 --> 03:37:27.610]  One day he just decided to kill his wife, to kill his mother, and then go down to the UT Tower on the Austin University campus, get up to the top and just start shooting people.
[03:37:28.291 --> 03:37:29.772]  No real motivation.
[03:37:29.792 --> 03:37:34.214]  He just had enough of life and decided to take a bunch of people along with him.
[03:37:35.454 --> 03:37:36.375]  Could that be the case?
[03:37:36.415 --> 03:37:40.496]  Could he have been inspired by Charles Whitman in any way?
[03:37:40.896 --> 03:37:46.799]  Again, it remains to be seen because no information has come out, despite the fact that they've now completely raided his house.
[03:37:46.819 --> 03:37:47.719]  That was yesterday.
[03:37:48.039 --> 03:37:53.782]  So obviously, if there was any indication of motivation, they would have seen it during the raid of the house, you'd think.
[03:37:55.214 --> 03:37:57.175]  Virtually no social media profile.
[03:37:57.195 --> 03:38:01.038]  I guess that's not out of the ordinary for somebody who's 64 years old.
[03:38:01.978 --> 03:38:03.179]  But again, we know very little.
[03:38:03.199 --> 03:38:05.280]  This is a story out of Squawker.
[03:38:06.861 --> 03:38:08.422]  And it's about a 4chan posting.
[03:38:08.762 --> 03:38:11.104]  4chan warned about Vegas three weeks early.
[03:38:11.164 --> 03:38:13.886]  Possible financial political gain behind mass murder.
[03:38:14.246 --> 03:38:24.132]  Three weeks ago, on 9-11, September 11, earlier this year, last month, a mysterious 4chan user who went only by John made a series
[03:38:24.893 --> 03:38:27.075]  Of at the time what seemed overlooked post.
[03:38:27.095 --> 03:38:39.923]  He warned users to stay away from any gatherings of large groups of people in the Vegas or nearby Henderson area, stating he had insider knowledge of what he referred to as a high incident project that was set to occur soon.
[03:38:39.943 --> 03:38:45.787]  And again, this is not extremely specific, but again, he did mention Las Vegas.
[03:38:45.807 --> 03:38:47.768]  He did mention large groups of people.
[03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:49.429]  You can go read the post.
[03:38:50.470 --> 03:38:54.533]  He wrote, I can't guarantee anything will happen tomorrow, but Las Vegas is on their mind.
[03:38:56.036 --> 03:39:01.639]  Seems almost frightening now, just a few weeks later, the largest mass shooting in American history occurred at this very location.
[03:39:01.659 --> 03:39:04.620]  So you can go and read those posts, make your own mind up.
[03:39:05.001 --> 03:39:19.888]  That normally happens in a lot of these cases, you know, you get these vague predictions and they seem more ominous after the fact, because you get a lot of these predictions and nothing whatsoever happens, so obviously the ones that are vaguely correct are going to get all the attention.
[03:39:20.968 --> 03:39:23.090]  But again, it's an interesting post nonetheless.
[03:39:23.390 --> 03:39:23.790]  ISIS
[03:39:24.867 --> 03:39:32.133]  Which kind of has been poo-pooed over the last 24 hours is doubling down on their claim that this was their attack.
[03:39:32.654 --> 03:39:40.420]  This is out of the Daily Mail, ISIS releases new video bragging that Las Vegas shooting is revenge for US attacks against their caliphate.
[03:39:41.101 --> 03:39:49.248]  Islamic State has released a new video bragging that the Las Vegas massacre was revenge for US attacks against their caliphate and what appears to be a desperate publicity stunt
[03:39:50.089 --> 03:39:57.274]  The terror group claimed the horrific acts of Stephen Paddock were down to them, saying they radicalised him months before he shot 59 people dead.
[03:39:58.074 --> 03:40:06.720]  FBI officials rubbished the claim, saying he had no affiliation to any terrorist organisation, but the Islamic extremists took to their propaganda news agencies to spread the word.
[03:40:07.881 --> 03:40:10.223]  Now, of course, that came out of their official news agency.
[03:40:10.983 --> 03:40:16.427]  As the AP admitted yesterday, they don't often claim responsibility, despite a lot of people thinking they do.
[03:40:17.190 --> 03:40:26.578]  And yeah, it's happened on a couple of occasions, but they don't always claim responsibility for attacks that aren't, at least in the AP's words, loosely linked to ISIS.
[03:40:26.999 --> 03:40:34.706]  The Edmonton attack in Canada on Sunday, an ISIS sympathiser, ISIS flag in his car, tries to mow down pedestrians and police.
[03:40:35.306 --> 03:40:36.808]  Did ISIS claim responsibility?
[03:40:36.868 --> 03:40:37.088]  No.
[03:40:37.969 --> 03:40:39.530]  But they claim responsibility for this.
[03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:41.772]  Is it because they're losing ground on the battlefield?
[03:40:41.792 --> 03:40:42.633]  They're getting desperate?
[03:40:43.325 --> 03:40:47.086]  Or are they just claiming attacks that they have nothing to do with, to save face?
[03:40:47.986 --> 03:40:50.366]  Again, it remains to be seen, but they haven't backed away from it.
[03:40:50.446 --> 03:40:56.568]  Now they've released a new propaganda video, again asserting that they had radicalised the shooter.
[03:40:58.068 --> 03:41:11.811]  Now, of course, the big trending topic on Twitter, as well as the number one trending video on YouTube overnight, was Jimmy Kimmel blasting gun rights after Las Vegas massacre, but of course he has his own armed security.
[03:41:12.489 --> 03:41:15.470]  Now, he wasn't just talking about fully automatic weapons or any of that.
[03:41:15.490 --> 03:41:19.732]  He was basically talking about the entire gamut of the Second Amendment debate.
[03:41:19.752 --> 03:41:27.035]  Oh, and by the way, virtually every claim he made was debunked in a Breitbart article, which is linked from this article on InfoWars.com.
[03:41:28.195 --> 03:41:39.260]  So, once again, which he does after every political event, of course, he tears up, he starts crying, he trends on Twitter, you know, the video gets two, three, four million views.
[03:41:40.037 --> 03:41:44.761]  People don't actually look into his claims and they don't look into his hypocrisy, which I did.
[03:41:45.722 --> 03:41:51.687]  Turns out that Jimmy Kimmel recently bolstered his own armed security.
[03:41:52.127 --> 03:42:04.478]  So while he's ranting about the NRA and how an ordinary American shouldn't be able to exercise their Second Amendment rights, he exercised his own Second Amendment rights more vigorously in recent weeks
[03:42:05.979 --> 03:42:08.501]  We have an article out of Mercury News linked in this article.
[03:42:08.621 --> 03:42:15.946]  Recent reports confirm Kimmel has beefed up his security due to the increasingly polarised and political nature of his rants.
[03:42:16.486 --> 03:42:20.128]  Because, of course, if you remember, if you recall, this guy's actually a comedian.
[03:42:21.089 --> 03:42:26.052]  But now, of course, a lot of Americans don't watch the news, so they have to put the indoctrination into the comedy shows.
[03:42:26.553 --> 03:42:31.136]  In fact, that's the only avenue in which the left is still dominant on YouTube.
[03:42:31.867 --> 03:42:34.049]  Is those late-night comedy shows?
[03:42:34.649 --> 03:42:39.052]  The whole SJW brigade got trounced over the past two years, so that's all they have left.
[03:42:39.712 --> 03:42:44.996]  So this is why YouTube ensures that these videos trend week after week after week.
[03:42:46.217 --> 03:42:52.801]  The Mercury News reports about Kimmel ever since the late-night show hosts began crusading against the effort by President Donald Trump.
[03:42:53.524 --> 03:42:59.509]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[03:42:59.529 --> 03:42:59.809]  That's right.

[03:43:32.980 --> 03:43:39.667]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[03:43:39.827 --> 03:43:41.547]  There is no comparison.
[03:43:41.687 --> 03:43:50.930]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:43:51.290 --> 03:43:54.611]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[03:43:58.832 --> 03:43:59.692]  So what are you waiting for?

[03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:19.024]  We're going to send a crew into Puerto Rico to get some attention on that.
[03:45:19.684 --> 03:45:20.405]  Still no power.
[03:45:20.865 --> 03:45:21.666]  I mean, it's dire.
[03:45:22.166 --> 03:45:24.728]  So it takes a lot of money to fund all this, obviously.

[03:46:53.935 --> 03:46:58.196]  But we need massive funding to energize and really go on the offense.
[03:46:58.676 --> 03:47:00.679]  We need to expand now on the face of the enemy.
[03:47:00.759 --> 03:47:02.342]  We need your help.
[03:47:06.268 --> 03:47:08.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:19.873 --> 03:47:26.475]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:26.915 --> 03:47:30.736]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:33.177 --> 03:47:33.677]  You're back.
[03:47:33.697 --> 03:47:35.817]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:35.837 --> 03:47:38.538]  Talking about that article up on Infowars.com.
[03:47:39.318 --> 03:47:44.160]  Jimmy Kimmel bashes gun rights after Las Vegas massacre, but has his own armed security.
[03:47:45.126 --> 03:47:54.376]  It's pretty easy to figure out if he did indeed have armed security because there was a YouTube clip uploaded by the Jimmy Kimmel Live show back in 2015.
[03:47:54.456 --> 03:48:01.284]  If you scroll down in this article, in 4Wars.com article, and it shows one of his security guards.
[03:48:01.324 --> 03:48:05.869]  They did a skit which included one of their security guards and you could see
[03:48:06.758 --> 03:48:10.859]  For a brief second his shirt lifts up and he's indeed packing heat.
[03:48:11.279 --> 03:48:16.201]  He has a Glock, he's armed, he's protecting Jimmy Kimmel and his staff.
[03:48:16.701 --> 03:48:18.061]  And they recently beefed it.
[03:48:18.101 --> 03:48:20.962]  There you see the image in the Enforce.com article.
[03:48:21.002 --> 03:48:22.843]  They recently beefed the security.
[03:48:25.476 --> 03:48:27.698]  This is out of the Mercury News.
[03:48:27.738 --> 03:48:35.243]  In response to these threats or incidents with Trump supporters that they talk about, the show has increased personnel at both the front and back entrances.
[03:48:35.283 --> 03:48:43.129]  The personnel consists of highly trained, off-duty police officers, which judging by that image we saw there, are all going to be armed.
[03:48:43.609 --> 03:48:49.754]  So you can't have your Second Amendment rights, but if Jimmy Kimmel needs to feel that little bit safer, he can have his.
[03:48:50.274 --> 03:48:57.221]  Because it's the same as Michael Moore, who built part of his career on bowling for Columbine, this anti-Second Amendment movie.
[03:48:58.702 --> 03:49:00.964]  He owns guns, he has armed security.
[03:49:01.244 --> 03:49:05.648]  He admitted in a 2008 Larry King interview, Michael Moore, that he owns guns.
[03:49:05.869 --> 03:49:13.596]  His own security got caught violating a gun law, I believe, when he was walking through an airport with a gun back a few years ago.
[03:49:13.676 --> 03:49:15.798]  So he can have guns, he can have armed security,
[03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:25.017]  Because he's better than you, and you don't get to exercise your rights because bad men do things with objects, so we have to ban everything.
[03:49:25.037 --> 03:49:26.278]  Of course, in Nice...
[03:49:27.330 --> 03:49:32.192]  Somebody with a truck killed 84 people, even more than the Las Vegas massacre.
[03:49:32.712 --> 03:49:34.112]  What was the solution to that?
[03:49:34.152 --> 03:49:34.972]  Do we ban trucks?
[03:49:35.033 --> 03:49:38.934]  No, because bad people are always going to find ways to kill people.
[03:49:39.154 --> 03:49:42.115]  Literally every week now in France, there's a stabbing.
[03:49:42.515 --> 03:49:44.596]  There's a mass stabbing in China all the time.
[03:49:44.636 --> 03:49:45.916]  There's explosives used.
[03:49:46.436 --> 03:49:51.798]  You can't get to the root of an ideology or to the root of hatred by just banning objects.
[03:49:51.858 --> 03:49:52.398]  It doesn't work.
[03:49:52.918 --> 03:49:55.099]  Is this because of the polarised nature
[03:49:56.028 --> 03:50:00.469]  Of America that we've seen since Trump was elected, was he radicalised by ISIS?
[03:50:00.529 --> 03:50:02.030]  Was he radicalised by CNN?
[03:50:02.070 --> 03:50:03.590]  Was there no motive whatsoever?
[03:50:03.630 --> 03:50:04.730]  Was he just mentally ill?
[03:50:05.290 --> 03:50:16.453]  We don't yet know, but again, we have to get to the source of it without using it to bash other people over the head just because, you know, it fits into our agenda, because it makes the other team look bad.
[03:50:16.813 --> 03:50:21.474]  That is one aspect of it that people have tripped themselves up with over the past couple of days.
[03:50:22.055 --> 03:50:23.495]  Again, as I mentioned earlier,
[03:50:24.218 --> 03:50:29.539]  By identifying the wrong person as the shooter, just so they could score political points.
[03:50:30.120 --> 03:50:30.420]  Okay?
[03:50:30.700 --> 03:50:36.621]  It's important to get to the bottom of this and to find out the motive, so we can try and understand it and try and stop it.
[03:50:36.861 --> 03:50:42.163]  And if it is due to increased rage and polarization, either on the left or the right,
[03:50:43.143 --> 03:50:44.846]  To try and address it and do something about it.
[03:50:44.886 --> 03:50:52.757]  But don't just like pick somebody who fits your worldview and say, oh, this is the shooter because he liked Rachel Maddow on Facebook.
[03:50:52.837 --> 03:50:54.039]  No, try and be accurate.
[03:50:54.359 --> 03:50:55.320]  Try and be factual.
[03:50:55.781 --> 03:50:59.126]  But it's difficult because there's so so little information coming out.
[03:51:00.782 --> 03:51:02.363]  Let's cover a few other news stories here.
[03:51:02.403 --> 03:51:04.745]  Of course, yesterday we had this bizarre story.
[03:51:04.885 --> 03:51:10.388]  USC professor detained after breakdown led to active shooter scare on campus.
[03:51:11.028 --> 03:51:24.957]  Of course, the day after the Las Vegas massacre, reports of a shooting at USC Monday afternoon were the result of confusion and alarm after a university professor suffered some sort of episode on campus, Los Angeles Police said.
[03:51:24.977 --> 03:51:29.340]  According to Los Angeles Police Department, a female faculty member
[03:51:30.293 --> 03:51:36.097]  had a breakdown and started yelling about an active shooter which caused everybody to panic.
[03:51:37.758 --> 03:51:45.303]  The USC Department of Public Safety said it was reported during class a faculty member falsely told her students there was an active shooter in the building.
[03:51:45.523 --> 03:51:54.969]  And this went across the media, this was on Twitter, active shooting in a California university, people were freaking out, it was the day after the Las Vegas massacre.
[03:51:55.329 --> 03:51:56.690]  This never happened!
[03:51:57.611 --> 03:51:59.072]  Some crazy professor
[03:51:59.815 --> 03:52:02.716]  Just started shouting there was an active shooter on campus.
[03:52:02.976 --> 03:52:04.197]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:52:05.477 --> 03:52:10.299]  And not what you need the day after America's deadliest mass shooting.
[03:52:10.940 --> 03:52:12.040]  Insane story.
[03:52:12.880 --> 03:52:19.623]  Another insane story out of France, but getting noticeably less insane as it happens all the frigging time.
[03:52:20.083 --> 03:52:21.384]  They actually uncovered a plot.
[03:52:22.583 --> 03:52:24.385]  To bomb an apartment building.
[03:52:24.625 --> 03:52:34.314]  We saw that back in Russia in the late 90s, of course, where in some cases hundreds of people were killed when Islamic terrorists tried to bomb just regular apartment buildings.
[03:52:35.077 --> 03:52:36.557]  Now it's happening in France.
[03:52:36.657 --> 03:52:40.638]  Thankfully, they uncovered the plot at the last minute, the headline out of Breitbart.
[03:52:41.159 --> 03:52:45.180]  In wake of attempted Paris bombing, French government says no one is safe.
[03:52:45.700 --> 03:52:52.461]  French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb has warned no one is safe after the authorities foiled an attempted apartment bombing in Paris.
[03:52:53.462 --> 03:53:03.244]  Five suspects have been detained after a resident in an apartment building in the 16th arrondissement reported suspicious activity to the police, the Associated Press reports.
[03:53:04.082 --> 03:53:09.085]  So this is not a high-profile target building in the centre of the city.
[03:53:09.786 --> 03:53:14.588]  It's a well-to-do, upscale, luxury apartment building on the outskirts.
[03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:16.910]  Now they're targeting those.
[03:53:17.410 --> 03:53:19.091]  They're going after the soft targets.
[03:53:19.611 --> 03:53:24.715]  An explosive device was subsequently discovered and successfully defused in counter-terrorism.
[03:53:24.895 --> 03:53:26.856]  Prosecutors have opened an investigation.
[03:53:28.288 --> 03:53:34.070]  Colombe said, blowing up a building in a chic neighbourhood of Paris, is this not a sign that no one is safe?
[03:53:34.110 --> 03:53:38.732]  This doesn't happen just in suburbs, in working class neighbourhoods.
[03:53:39.493 --> 03:53:57.320]  The Interior Minister had to admit one of the suspects was already subject to government surveillance for radicalism, they always are, suggesting that they had been able to participate in the plot undetected, because such people usually have friends and networks that can carry out the act, and assistance from people who have not displayed outward signs of radicalisation but are ready to help.
[03:53:58.143 --> 03:54:07.506]  The offensive bombing follows hot on the heels of a deadly attack in Marseille in which a man reported shafting Alarac Bar slipped one woman's throat and fatally stabbed another at the St Charles Railway Station.
[03:54:08.347 --> 03:54:09.967]  Which means, of course, we should ban knives.
[03:54:10.027 --> 03:54:11.107]  That's going to solve the problem.
[03:54:11.127 --> 03:54:18.410]  But they're now targeting apartment buildings in Paris occupied by well-to-do residents.
[03:54:18.450 --> 03:54:21.211]  That's how bad the problem is becoming.
[03:54:23.962 --> 03:54:25.142]  Another story out of Germany.
[03:54:25.162 --> 03:54:27.323]  Psychiatrist warns of time bomb in Germany.
[03:54:27.363 --> 03:54:30.024]  Today's migrants are not integratable.
[03:54:30.144 --> 03:54:37.747]  A psychiatrist has warned Germany faces a time bomb as a result of mass migration of young men who have crazy potential for aggression.
[03:54:37.787 --> 03:54:38.527]  That's his quote.
[03:54:38.867 --> 03:54:40.788]  Crazy potential for aggression.
[03:54:41.548 --> 03:54:42.508]  This is a time bomb.
[03:54:42.889 --> 03:54:49.811]  Christian Peter Doge said of their decision to open Germany's borders in an appearance on the Peter Hahn talk show on ZDF last month.
[03:54:50.572 --> 03:54:55.994]  Explaining the psychiatry's found people's temperament and personality are usually fixed by the age of 12.
[03:54:57.914 --> 03:55:11.459]  Stating that migrants can't just be taught to understand our values he said classes on how to behave in Germany were unlikely to have much effect because they have classes across Europe now teaching migrants not to rate women hasn't had a great effect judging by the stats.
[03:55:12.279 --> 03:55:13.620]  He said you have to accept that.
[03:55:13.680 --> 03:55:14.140]  Now of course
[03:55:15.436 --> 03:55:20.562]  What we're seeing in Europe is that these migrants are becoming more radicalised the younger they are.
[03:55:22.144 --> 03:55:23.786]  They're not integrating at all!
[03:55:24.086 --> 03:55:27.610]  They're not becoming westernised, they're becoming more Islamised.
[03:55:28.111 --> 03:55:30.454]  There's more hijabs being worn by young women.
[03:55:30.494 --> 03:55:31.995]  I've seen it myself in France.
[03:55:32.516 --> 03:55:33.938]  My family just moved out of there.
[03:55:35.740 --> 03:55:45.148]  He went on on the show episode, the topic of which was the power of fear, to say that the biggest mistake politicians are making now with regards to the migrant influx is their response to voters' concern on the issue.
[03:55:45.188 --> 03:55:55.818]  Now, of course, in Germany, Angela Merkel just got routed by the far-right AFD, which is basically a one-topic party around immigration.
[03:55:56.778 --> 03:55:58.380]  And what constitutes far-right?
[03:55:58.400 --> 03:56:00.402]  Well, that leads us to this story out of RT.
[03:56:01.306 --> 03:56:05.927]  Watching terrorism videos online could result in 15-year jail term.
[03:56:06.768 --> 03:56:15.250]  People who watch terrorist propaganda online could face up to 15 years behind bars, Home Secretary Amber Rudd has announced in a movie designed to tighten laws tackling radicalisation.
[03:56:15.270 --> 03:56:17.211]  This, of course, is in the UK.
[03:56:17.871 --> 03:56:23.513]  Oh, and by the way, when they say terrorist propaganda, they also mean far-right propaganda.
[03:56:25.254 --> 03:56:26.794]  They call me far-right!
[03:56:26.894 --> 03:56:29.535]  Anyone right of Karl Marx in the United Kingdom
[03:56:30.206 --> 03:56:30.966]  Is far right.
[03:56:31.386 --> 03:56:39.068]  They call UKIP, which was the third biggest political party in the country in 2015, they call them far right.
[03:56:39.108 --> 03:56:43.589]  So what, if you watch a Nigel Farage speak, are you going to be in prison for 15 years?
[03:56:44.029 --> 03:56:45.589]  You see the slippery slope here.
[03:56:46.449 --> 03:56:53.671]  The new law will extend an existing ban on downloading and storing content on a PC repeatedly, watching on sites like YouTube.
[03:56:55.180 --> 03:56:57.901]  And they literally list far-right propaganda.
[03:56:58.302 --> 03:57:02.904]  Now, the definition is so subjective that it could literally mean anything.
[03:57:03.344 --> 03:57:10.828]  A defensive reasonable excuse would still be available to academics, journalists or others who may have a legitimate reason to view such material.
[03:57:11.208 --> 03:57:17.592]  Of course, whether you're a journalist or whatever description you want to use, of course, that depends on what they think as well.
[03:57:19.227 --> 03:57:20.528]  Far-right propaganda.
[03:57:20.568 --> 03:57:22.629]  They call Nigel Farage far-right.
[03:57:22.829 --> 03:57:26.151]  If you watch his speech in front of the European Parliament, you're going to get arrested.
[03:57:27.232 --> 03:57:29.333]  See how slippery those terms they use are.
[03:57:30.534 --> 03:57:32.876]  That brings us to the end of the broadcast.
[03:57:32.916 --> 03:57:36.198]  Again, we're keeping track of the latest on the Las Vegas massacre.
[03:57:37.078 --> 03:57:38.559]  Online at infowars.com.
[03:57:38.579 --> 03:57:39.620]  That's going to wrap it up, though.
[03:57:39.640 --> 03:57:41.581]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:42.342 --> 03:57:43.122]  Stay tuned again.
[03:57:43.162 --> 03:57:45.484]  Breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:57:52.537 --> 03:57:54.717]  Before I go any further, we need your financial support.
[03:57:54.858 --> 03:58:04.180]  I want to hire a bunch of people, because I'm all in this year, spending everything on expansion, adding those shows, adding more broadcasters, adding more camera crews.
[03:58:04.680 --> 03:58:07.120]  We're going to send a crew into Puerto Rico.
[03:58:07.680 --> 03:58:08.600]  Get some attention on that.
[03:58:08.620 --> 03:58:09.981]  Still no power.
[03:58:10.321 --> 03:58:11.221]  I mean, it's dire.
[03:58:11.741 --> 03:58:14.322]  So it takes a lot of money to fund all this, obviously.
[03:58:14.842 --> 03:58:15.402]  So please,
[03:58:17.253 --> 03:58:19.375]  Buy a lot of products from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:19.455 --> 03:58:21.758]  They're game-changing supplements and nutraceuticals.
[03:58:22.338 --> 03:58:25.702]  Really great InfoWars.com ball hats, shirts.
[03:58:26.582 --> 03:58:28.044]  But we got Molon Labe shirts.
[03:58:28.204 --> 03:58:29.265]  You know, so much more.
[03:58:29.285 --> 03:58:33.650]  If you want to make a stand for free speech and wear a Trump's My President shirt, then that's great.
[03:58:33.990 --> 03:58:35.231]  Or an InfoWars.com shirt.
[03:58:35.251 --> 03:58:37.694]  We've also got them that, you know, just say Molon Labe.
[03:58:38.314 --> 03:58:41.717]  And a little communist won't know what that is because we're so stupid and won't stab you in the back.
[03:58:42.258 --> 03:58:45.021]  But they really are trying to intimidate everybody right now into submission.
[03:58:45.321 --> 03:58:46.822]  We've got CNN's fake news shirts.
[03:58:47.183 --> 03:58:52.628]  We have the new Dayglo Hunters Infowars.com hats from Richardson.
[03:58:52.908 --> 03:58:54.310]  Best quality out there in my view.
[03:58:54.330 --> 03:58:55.691]  Everybody loves the hats.
[03:58:55.711 --> 03:58:59.154]  We've got the Infowars.com hats also with the snake.
[03:58:59.174 --> 03:58:59.655]  I wear
