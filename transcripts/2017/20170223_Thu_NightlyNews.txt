[00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.731]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:22.012]  It's February 23rd, 2017.
[00:00:23.253 --> 00:00:24.374]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.494 --> 00:00:25.515]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:35.516]  In the first 30 days of the Trump administration, CIA arms shipments to rebels in Syria were frozen.
[00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:42.701]  Now John McCain takes a secret trip to Syria to meet with the so-called moderate rebels, who are actually ISIS.
[00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:51.527]  Then, Project Veritas has hundreds of hours of behind-the-scene audio from CNN, the most busted name in news.
[00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.028]  Everyone's saying, who are you going after next?
[00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:55.990]  I'm gonna tell you right now, I'll make it public.
[00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.031]  I'm going after the media next.
[00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:03.574]  And a radioactive cloud is drifting across Europe.
[00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:10.859]  What is behind the spike in the levels of radioactive iodine-131 that's moving from Eastern Europe toward the UK?
[00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.522]  The US has sent a specially modified aircraft to solve the mystery.
[00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:20.286]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:36.952]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:44.718]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:11.651]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, everybody was excited for the next batch of Project Veritas videos.
[00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.712]  Apparently they had hundreds of hours of CNN footage.
[00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:20.255]  So what they do today, they released that footage on their website.
[00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:27.458]  James O'Keefe has now offered a $10,000 award for evidence of media malfeasance.
[00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.920]  Now, this is the interesting thing about this last one.
[00:03:31.263 --> 00:03:51.944]  Now James O'Keefe has put this bounty out there essentially to help him track down media malfeasance and I think what he would like to do is have people go through these hundreds of hours of videotape that they uploaded to their website and see if they hear anything, find anything interesting, almost like a WikiLeaks email dump.
[00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.467]  But here's the thing, they are under attack.
[00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:55.948]  This is from Politico.
[00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:57.210]  While I will admit...
[00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:12.831]  This didn't have as much excitement or as much of an impact as Project Veritas' last videos, exposing the DNC, exposing the Disrupt J20.
[00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:23.060]  However, this is like going to a ballgame and a guy just hit four home runs for four days in a row, and then you show up to the ballpark and he only hits one home run.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.701]  It was still a great day.
[00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.264]  Sorry he didn't have the greatest day in history, but it is worth noting
[00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:37.291]  That they put these hundreds of hours on their website, and maybe you, maybe you could be the next person to get an award from James O'Keefe.
[00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:43.535]  You go through these tapes, you find something interesting, and maybe James O'Keefe is looking to talk with you.
[00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:48.418]  So, that's what came of the big drop today from Project Veritas.
[00:04:48.618 --> 00:04:57.945]  Again, I know a lot of people were expecting something huge, but this is more like a Wikileaks-style dump, and I think the overall impact is yet to be known.
[00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:04.328]  Well, the overall impact of Trump is very well known, and the people who are working with him are praising his open-door policy.
[00:05:04.668 --> 00:05:05.908]  This is something that I talked about.
[00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:20.155]  You know, Donald Trump's White House has been the most transparent White House maybe of all time, certainly in my life, but now people inside the White House working are just amazed at how, hey, if I need access to Donald Trump, if I've got something I want to talk to him about,
[00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:21.957]  I just walk right into his office.
[00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:24.299]  The door is always open for me.
[00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:33.748]  So not just the media in there every time he signs an executive order, not just doing hour and a half long press conferences, taking questions from anybody, even going to Skype for questions.
[00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:38.753]  He has an open door policy within the White House and the people that are working there are enjoying it.
[00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:49.961]  Now, more out of the White House, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, we are committed to very significant tax reform by August recess.
[00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:50.361]  What?
[00:05:51.261 --> 00:05:51.822]  August?
[00:05:52.762 --> 00:05:53.823]  I'm not down with this.
[00:05:54.183 --> 00:05:55.924]  Why isn't this bipartisan?
[00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.667]  Why can't we do something about lowering taxes
[00:06:01.024 --> 00:06:01.844]  Bipartisanly.
[00:06:02.524 --> 00:06:04.625]  You would think that that's something that both sides could get behind.
[00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:11.686]  Of course, we know that's not the case, given the welfare state, and we've actually got more about Democrats trying to raise taxes later in the segment.
[00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:14.646]  But to me, I hear this, and this is not good news.
[00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:19.047]  I know that Mnuchin is sitting here trying to say, hey, this is a good thing, we're gonna get the taxes lowered.
[00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:22.188]  Well, let's do it a little sooner than August, then.
[00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:28.189]  Now, if they get it done in August, and it's the tax proposal plan that we've seen Donald Trump put on his website,
[00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:30.390]  Okay then, we'll applaud you.
[00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.951]  But it still feels like August.
[00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:36.695]  It feels like it's an attempt to just keep pushing this back, pushing this back, and get us used to that.
[00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:37.796]  Now...
[00:06:39.153 --> 00:06:43.497]  On to John McCain, someone who is very bitter that he was never in the White House.
[00:06:43.777 --> 00:06:46.680]  John McCain makes secret trip to Syria in midst of U.S.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.261]  assessment.
[00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:59.452]  Senator John, this is unheard of by the way, Senator John McCain secretly traveled to northern Syria last weekend to speak with American military officials and Kurdish fighters at the forefront of the push to drive the Islamic State out of their capital in Raqqa.
[00:06:59.492 --> 00:07:00.673]  This is according to U.S.
[00:07:00.713 --> 00:07:03.475]  officials, to which I ask, what officials?
[00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:05.397]  Who are these officials?
[00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:06.738]  I don't know who these officials are.
[00:07:06.918 --> 00:07:07.318]  Do you?
[00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:09.620]  I don't see Donald Trump talking about this.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.502]  I don't see anyone out of the Trump cabinet talking about this.
[00:07:13.003 --> 00:07:18.827]  McCain first traveled to the rebel-controlled Syria in 2013 when he met with the leaders of the Free Syrian Army.
[00:07:19.168 --> 00:07:20.148]  This is huge, folks.
[00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:22.990]  The umbrella group supported by America and its allies.
[00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.053]  This was believed to be the first visit to Syria since then.
[00:07:26.073 --> 00:07:27.194]  This is very rare, folks.
[00:07:27.234 --> 00:07:29.175]  It's very rare for somebody out of the U.S.
[00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:30.476]  government to go visit Syria like this.
[00:07:30.836 --> 00:07:32.658]  Why is John McCain doing it secretly?
[00:07:33.158 --> 00:07:41.210]  Why in 2013 did he meet with the Syrian Army, which is nothing more than a proxy army of Wahhabis that John McCain is managing?
[00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:43.373]  You see what's going on here, folks?
[00:07:44.014 --> 00:07:45.536]  John McCain is up to no good.
[00:07:46.852 --> 00:07:51.016]  What gives John McCain the authority and the power, and who is he meeting with exactly?
[00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.119]  We know who he's met with in the past.
[00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:54.260]  The Free Syrian Army?
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.142]  Look at who they turned out to be working with.
[00:07:56.682 --> 00:07:57.043]  ISIS.
[00:07:57.723 --> 00:07:59.225]  Why is John McCain meeting with them?
[00:07:59.565 --> 00:08:02.068]  Donald Trump needs to be all over John McCain on this, in my opinion.
[00:08:02.408 --> 00:08:04.070]  Here's Democrats trying to raise your taxes.
[00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.793]  Massachusetts tries gun control the old-fashioned way.
[00:08:07.173 --> 00:08:07.953]  Higher taxes.
[00:08:07.973 --> 00:08:10.495]  Oh, you want to infringe on my Second Amendment right, don't you?
[00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:12.576]  4.75% surcharge increase, 6.25% sales tax, 11% federal excise tax.
[00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:14.017]  That's called infringement, Democrats!
[00:08:14.037 --> 00:08:14.817]  Read the Bill of Rights.
[00:08:14.857 --> 00:08:14.917]  Now.
[00:08:35.327 --> 00:08:39.310]  Boy is John Podesta just in a whole mess of himself right now.
[00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:42.793]  But the Washington Post has still decided to give him a column.
[00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:46.175]  John Podesta joins the Washington Post as contributing artist.
[00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:49.898]  Boy, it's been a rough time for Podesta on social media.
[00:08:50.478 --> 00:08:57.824]  He's even been called a loser by Lynne de Rothschild blaming Podesta for Hillary Clinton's loss
[00:08:58.464 --> 00:09:04.445]  I don't know if he's referring to the emails or the incompetence or something else, but that was interesting to see.
[00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:08.866]  But you know, Podesta isn't the only scumbag out of the Democratic Party.
[00:09:09.126 --> 00:09:14.047]  We've also got one Maxine Waters, who might just be completely mentally deranged.
[00:09:14.647 --> 00:09:16.708]  Here's John Bowne with more on that.
[00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:21.469]  I've fallen and I can't get up!
[00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:27.598]  We're sending help immediately, Mrs. Fletcher.
[00:09:27.978 --> 00:09:33.620]  The reality is, is that the world has moved to a place where the Democratic Party is no longer keeping up with it.
[00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:37.302]  There are more independents than there are registered party people.
[00:09:37.602 --> 00:09:46.428]  Not only was the primary rigged, it was also rigged all across the country because the DNC has never allowed outsiders or brand new people to rise through the ranks.
[00:09:46.788 --> 00:09:50.971]  It has always been an insider game, and it has been that way for a very, very long time.
[00:09:51.312 --> 00:10:04.301]  That is where that lack of trust has come into play, because not only was Bernie Sanders snubbed, not only did it look like Hillary Clinton had bought or muscled her way into it, then those supporters were denied a chance to speak.
[00:10:04.841 --> 00:10:17.064]  Minnesota Representative Keith Ellison, one of the lunatics in line to take over the Iron Throne at the DNC, is calling for the impeachment of President Trump, fueled by outright arrogance.
[00:10:17.425 --> 00:10:22.266]  Donald Trump has already done a number of things which legitimately raise the question of impeachment.
[00:10:22.586 --> 00:10:29.428]  Meanwhile, the crossed wires in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's brain continue to malfunction.
[00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:35.950]  In fact, don't take it from me, John Kasich, the governor of Illinois, said, thank God for Medicaid.
[00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:50.835]  As Martin Luther King said, of all the inequality I've seen, the most damaging, and he used a different word, is the inequality of access to health care.
[00:10:51.095 --> 00:10:58.138]  While New York Senator Chuck Schumer takes his visceral bag of Democratic Party dogma to the American public.
[00:10:59.193 --> 00:11:13.104]  I am worried that Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, is so close to Trump in so many ways that that investigation certainly won't have the appearance of impartiality and may not be impartial itself.
[00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.867]  So I've called today on Jed Sessions to recuse himself.
[00:11:16.907 --> 00:11:21.731]  And if you agree with that, TV audience, tell your senator or congressman to do it.
[00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:36.016]  Leading the charge with falsehoods blazing is California Representative Maximum Overdrive Maxine Waters, resorting to an all-out ambush on the intellect of the silent majority of American voters.
[00:11:36.416 --> 00:11:45.320]  My colleagues and the leadership would not like to hear me say the I-word, but I say it over and over again, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment!
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:12:08.421]  Perhaps Maxine Waters is still angry that she was investigated for three years by the House Ethics Committee for the favors resulting in the $12 million TARP bailout funds her husband's bank received after One United Bank was given special favors due to Waters' connections to allow One United Bank to plead with the Treasury Department
[00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:17.190]  After the financial crisis of 2007-2008, after all, the executives at one United Bank financed Waters' campaign.
[00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:25.238]  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Waters to its list of corrupt members of Congress in its 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2011 reports.
[00:12:30.023 --> 00:12:30.223]  Hmm.
[00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.304]  Maxine.
[00:12:31.344 --> 00:12:32.024]  Maxine.
[00:12:32.305 --> 00:12:34.086]  Why don't we impeach you?
[00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:39.209]  And I just think the American people had better understand what's going on.
[00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.691]  This is a bunch of scumbags.
[00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:43.172]  That's what they are.
[00:12:43.192 --> 00:12:44.073]  Those are very strong words.
[00:12:44.093 --> 00:12:45.874]  Who are organized around making money.
[00:12:46.854 --> 00:12:48.936]  Who do you mean by that when you call them scumbags?
[00:12:48.956 --> 00:12:50.017]  Who are you talking to?
[00:12:50.037 --> 00:13:02.087]  All of these people who are organized with these oil and gas interests that's in the administration and friends of the President of the United States, this back-channeling that you see, these are a bunch of scumbags.
[00:13:02.127 --> 00:13:02.787]  That's what they are.
[00:13:02.807 --> 00:13:04.409]  You mean the Secretary of State of the United States?
[00:13:05.188 --> 00:13:24.293]  These mouthpieces of the imploding Democratic Party are as filthy a group of scumbags as they come, still bending the taxpayer's system to their diminishing financial and political advantage, and desperately sowing division in the shadow of their Lord and Savior, former President Barack Obama.
[00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:26.334]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:36.964]  Well there's no doubt that the Democrats thrive off identity politics and even race-based diversions and divide-and-conquer tactics.
[00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:39.087]  Now Keith Ellison is the latest.
[00:13:39.447 --> 00:13:44.453]  In fact, Keith Ellison once said black people don't have obligation to obey the government.
[00:13:44.473 --> 00:13:46.055]  I wonder what he meant by that.
[00:13:47.168 --> 00:13:51.950]  So I guess Keith Ellison feels that way because he doesn't have an obligation to tradition.
[00:13:52.050 --> 00:14:01.413]  Actually, he was the first to be sworn in on the Koran, but he said black people don't live in a democracy and don't have an obligation to obey the government.
[00:14:02.113 --> 00:14:03.334]  Well, actually, that's right.
[00:14:03.374 --> 00:14:05.454]  Black people in America don't live in a democracy.
[00:14:05.494 --> 00:14:06.615]  They live in a republic.
[00:14:07.775 --> 00:14:09.896]  But what exactly are you suggesting here?
[00:14:11.365 --> 00:14:17.470]  So the next time a Black Lives Matter march turns violent, are you okay with that?
[00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.974]  I mean, after all, according to you, you know, black people don't have to obey the government.
[00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:24.396]  What about white people?
[00:14:25.857 --> 00:14:27.218]  What about Asian people?
[00:14:28.319 --> 00:14:29.480]  Just forget about them, I guess.
[00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:31.102]  They need to obey the law.
[00:14:32.483 --> 00:14:38.508]  But again, this is the exact quote, you don't have an obligation to obey a government that considers you to be less than a human.
[00:14:39.332 --> 00:14:39.853]  And you know what?
[00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:47.599]  At a point in time, people like Martin Luther King exposed that, and here we are today, moved forward as a society.
[00:14:48.797 --> 00:14:50.538]  But, have we really moved forward?
[00:14:51.298 --> 00:14:52.478]  I don't think Ellison has.
[00:14:53.378 --> 00:14:56.299]  And my response to that comment is, look at what's happened at Infowars.
[00:14:56.319 --> 00:15:00.140]  Look at what's happening to conservatives in the media, on social media.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.161]  We are the ones that are now looked at as less than human.
[00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:05.202]  Fake news.
[00:15:05.762 --> 00:15:10.263]  You know, people get to assault Trump supporters out in the street and the media praises it.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.641]  I mean, literally, folks, you've seen all the videos.
[00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:20.144]  I don't need to talk about it ad nauseam, but again, we need to start putting light on the people who are encouraging this type of violence.
[00:15:20.444 --> 00:15:25.846]  The Robert Reeshes of the world.
[00:15:26.827 --> 00:15:27.787]  The Keith Ellisons.
[00:15:28.868 --> 00:15:36.171]  We need to shed light on these people and make sure they no longer have any say in our schools or in our governments, because this is what happens, folks.
[00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:40.653]  Outrage over food carts serving free food only for black people.
[00:15:41.943 --> 00:15:50.388]  Now this is outside the Bronx Supreme Court in New York, but why would somebody even have an idea like this in their head?
[00:15:50.808 --> 00:15:56.711]  Why would somebody who's out trying to feed people who are hungry care whether you're black or white?
[00:15:58.252 --> 00:16:00.413]  See, this is the virtue signaling, folks.
[00:16:01.114 --> 00:16:06.517]  This is what people like Keith Ellerson dream of when they virtue signal for whatever their cause is.
[00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:09.241]  In his case, it's black people.
[00:16:09.541 --> 00:16:13.024]  For Linda Sarsour's case, it's Muslims.
[00:16:14.966 --> 00:16:21.713]  But again, imagine this in reversal, if I had a food cart, and I was going through downtown, and I said, for white people only.
[00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.333]  Well, I'd certainly be on every mainstream media outlet, wouldn't I?
[00:16:26.773 --> 00:16:29.635]  Let's see if that story reaches CNN or MSNBC.
[00:16:30.015 --> 00:16:30.836]  Or maybe this one.
[00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:36.600]  University of Michigan students demand no whites allowed space to plot social justice activism.
[00:16:37.421 --> 00:16:37.801]  What?
[00:16:38.502 --> 00:16:50.491]  A student activist group at the University of Michigan is demanding campus officials provide them with a, quote, permanent designated space on central campus for black students and students of color to organize and do social work.
[00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:56.015]  Is that racist or am I just living in a vacuum here?
[00:16:57.277 --> 00:17:01.021]  Where nothing is racist as long as it's against the white man.
[00:17:02.017 --> 00:17:02.457]  I don't know.
[00:17:03.097 --> 00:17:12.419]  This is ironic, because this comes just on the heels of the public university building a $10 million center for black students in the center of campus.
[00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:18.740]  Of course, University of Michigan is not racist, and they say, hey, anybody can use this.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.862]  Black people, white people, old students, young students, transfer students, international students, it's for all students.
[00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:27.682]  But that's not enough for these protesters, see?
[00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:31.523]  They want a space where white people aren't even allowed in the door.
[00:17:32.702 --> 00:17:34.544]  Imagine that, folks.
[00:17:34.944 --> 00:17:36.365]  Imagine that.
[00:17:37.166 --> 00:17:37.767]  Imagine this.
[00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:43.352]  A Danish man who videotaped himself burning the Quran is now charged with blasphemy.
[00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:47.515]  This is the first time a case like this has been filed in 46 years.
[00:17:50.629 --> 00:18:04.179]  Now, the rumors of Quran burnings have sparked arrests, lynchings, and riots in Muslim-majority countries, while the move has been appropriated by the far-right and anti-Islamic groups, including the Westboro Baptist Church in America.
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.260]  I'm confused.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.161]  Where did they get that out of nowhere?
[00:18:08.202 --> 00:18:13.966]  They just throw the Westboro Baptist Church in here out of nowhere to associate that with anti-Islamic and far-right groups, of course.
[00:18:15.017 --> 00:18:20.219]  So, I just want to be on record that we have no association with the Westboro Baptist Church.
[00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:27.801]  However, it's interesting to think, if you burn the crayon in these Muslim countries, they will punish you severely.
[00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:30.422]  If you burn the flag in America, what happens?
[00:18:30.482 --> 00:18:31.282]  You get allowed to do it.
[00:18:31.302 --> 00:18:33.763]  Unless, of course, you're a round of Patriot, then you might get your ass kicked.
[00:18:34.543 --> 00:18:34.904]  U.S.
[00:18:34.964 --> 00:18:39.005]  nuclear center plane flies to Norway where radiation particles are spreading across Europe
[00:18:39.949 --> 00:18:42.271]  We're first detected as mystery still surrounds.
[00:18:42.311 --> 00:18:46.754]  The source comes after a spike in the levels of radioactive iodine-131 in Europe.
[00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:51.498]  And of course, this is also on the heels of Fukushima just getting worse and worse every day.
[00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:02.647]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:15.726]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:19:15.746 --> 00:19:23.290]  I mean there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-gmo organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.529]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.829 --> 00:23:00.753]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:06.323 --> 00:23:09.484]  The fact that we let this happen, you know, this is your greatest failure.
[00:23:10.205 --> 00:23:13.146]  And wherever that came from, I understood that.
[00:23:13.166 --> 00:23:16.467]  It doesn't mean we don't go after a bad cop or bad system protecting them.
[00:23:16.567 --> 00:23:22.550]  It's that the globalists, the TPP, the New World Order, the big systems, that's what makes these decisions.
[00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:33.775]  And as soon as we stop fighting with each other like black and white or citizen and, you know, a fellow citizen cop, you actually support the police and then go to their meetings and then go and tell them they're wrong.
[00:23:33.795 --> 00:23:34.635]  They'll break down crying.
[00:23:36.886 --> 00:23:40.068]  You tell them, I want to kill you, then they hate you.
[00:23:40.748 --> 00:23:41.489]  It's humanity.
[00:23:41.609 --> 00:23:46.432]  Whether what color you are, whether you're a cop, a citizen, you have to reach out with humanity and then nothing.
[00:23:46.612 --> 00:23:50.975]  Whether you're Hispanic, or black, or white, Asian, we're all humans.
[00:23:51.335 --> 00:23:52.976]  You reach out as a real person.
[00:23:53.945 --> 00:23:55.746]  And you actually do that, they can't stand it.
[00:23:56.286 --> 00:23:57.927]  They claim they want federal community policing.
[00:23:57.947 --> 00:23:58.847]  They made a bunch of spies.
[00:23:59.528 --> 00:24:00.348]  No, this is real.
[00:24:01.188 --> 00:24:04.170]  And again, they want us to blame our local government.
[00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:05.990]  The average mayor doesn't know what's going on.
[00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.331]  They just follow what the big corporations say in the new zoning law.
[00:24:08.632 --> 00:24:09.292]  You go show them.
[00:24:09.552 --> 00:24:10.993]  Austin's an exception.
[00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:11.973]  It's run by the U.N.
[00:24:12.233 --> 00:24:12.413]  The U.N.
[00:24:12.453 --> 00:24:14.574]  admits it's a model city, completely controlled.
[00:24:14.654 --> 00:24:15.675]  It's run by really bad people.
[00:24:16.235 --> 00:24:17.476]  It's a model for us.
[00:24:17.877 --> 00:24:18.898]  It's like, I didn't mean to be here.
[00:24:18.938 --> 00:24:19.679]  My mom's from here.
[00:24:19.719 --> 00:24:21.160]  I went to high school here, part of high school.
[00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:24.404]  I didn't mean to be like in the UN model fortress city.
[00:24:25.184 --> 00:24:26.366]  But other cities aren't the same.
[00:24:26.406 --> 00:24:28.948]  This is the model so they see it and hear what was successful.
[00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:34.114]  So we're like in, you know, the mountain of doom here.
[00:24:34.154 --> 00:24:38.679]  We're in, you know, the, I don't know what you call it, but these are
[00:24:40.421 --> 00:24:41.561]  Well, let's go to some more calls.
[00:24:41.721 --> 00:24:46.402]  They ask these questions and they're so big and they're so fundamental and they're so strong.
[00:24:46.862 --> 00:24:48.803]  I want to take some phone calls in a minute and bring Millie in here.
[00:24:48.843 --> 00:24:49.123]  Go ahead.
[00:24:49.143 --> 00:24:58.465]  Quick Swipe USA says, Alex, we know Trump's campaign promises and how well he's accomplishing them, but what do you predict Trump will do once he achieves them all?
[00:25:02.646 --> 00:25:07.067]  I think Trump will roll over and die.
[00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:10.188]  I mean, that's the big journey.
[00:25:10.228 --> 00:25:11.449]  That's the big mission completed.
[00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.171]  Enemy defeated.
[00:25:14.192 --> 00:25:24.981]  He'll roll over and let his kids have a name that he hopes they're worthy of into the future and the big golden march of humanity, which if you could see it, it's like, why would you follow that?
[00:25:25.962 --> 00:25:27.143]  That's a great opportunity.
[00:25:27.163 --> 00:25:28.364]  So he,
[00:25:30.771 --> 00:25:37.076]  Trump's greatest sin is that he doesn't hate people and he wants the average person to succeed.
[00:25:37.116 --> 00:25:41.139]  He's very competitive and he sees how anti-human this whole system is.
[00:25:41.819 --> 00:25:47.383]  And as a super alpha male, he wants to take on these forces of oppression.
[00:25:49.405 --> 00:25:52.587]  And his instincts are so pure.
[00:25:54.244 --> 00:25:59.829]  That he resonates and they can't stand it with a crowd of people or with Steve Bannon or with me.
[00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:06.975]  That's why the enemy just constantly tries to keep him out of the sunlight and out of the people because that just energizes him.
[00:26:07.135 --> 00:26:09.837]  And then they've got this big explosive flamethrower to deal with.
[00:26:10.518 --> 00:26:13.020]  But Trump can't lose at this point.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:21.487]  I mean, he's committed himself to life, committed himself to justice, and you can tell he's in a lot of pain spiritually.
[00:26:22.208 --> 00:26:24.010]  Before, he was just more of an arrogant alpha male.
[00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:28.193]  Now that he's in that office and channeling humanity's will, it's very humbling.
[00:26:28.813 --> 00:26:33.477]  And so, Trump is on his knees before God.
[00:26:34.518 --> 00:26:38.241]  And in that office, you can't do anything to Trump, even if they kill his body.
[00:26:38.761 --> 00:26:48.909]  The fact that he invoked the sacrament, the fact that he invoked the will of God, the fact that he invoked the birthright, the fact that he brought life back in and said it's a planet of men and women,
[00:26:49.750 --> 00:27:05.579]  And the fact that he spoke those satanic words to the enemy, because they're satanic to them, it's evil, that men and women are together and we have prosperity and we build and the image of a beautiful woman and a man and a nest and prosperity and strength and beauty, it just, it hurts them.
[00:27:06.379 --> 00:27:14.684]  And so they can't, you know, the evil wants to cut the birthright off and Trump is a big, shiny example of the birthright.
[00:27:15.725 --> 00:27:17.266]  And so that's why Trump must fall.
[00:27:18.146 --> 00:27:20.568]  Because Trump doesn't feel good when poor people are poor.
[00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:23.670]  He'll run over somebody, if he buys something, they try to screw him over.
[00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.432]  Oh, he's mean to an architect that triple-charged him.
[00:27:26.513 --> 00:27:27.934]  Oh, he's so horrible.
[00:27:28.114 --> 00:27:29.395]  It's all a load of crap.
[00:27:30.674 --> 00:27:34.695]  You know, what you know is when the whole world's being offered to him, he says, I don't want it.
[00:27:35.235 --> 00:27:37.256]  I want to empower people for all his crimes.
[00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:38.456]  None of us are perfect.
[00:27:38.476 --> 00:27:43.818]  We all have committed crimes against humanity, against ourselves, against our children, against our wives.
[00:27:44.138 --> 00:27:44.898]  None of us are perfect.
[00:27:44.938 --> 00:27:55.641]  But the point is Trump loves God and loves humanity and loves prosperity and doesn't like sorrow and pestilence and betrayal and ugliness.
[00:27:55.721 --> 00:27:57.722]  And because he loves beauty,
[00:27:58.502 --> 00:28:02.286]  Which Satan masquerades as beauty, but Trump loves the true beauty God gives us.
[00:28:02.686 --> 00:28:05.228]  Because of that, he's above the devil.
[00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:13.897]  TwoSpoonsJohnson has the most important question of the night, and he says, Would you rather fight a globalist-sized lizard or a hundred lizard-sized globalists?
[00:28:14.838 --> 00:28:15.298]  Say that again?
[00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:22.305]  Would you rather fight a globalist-sized lizard or a hundred lizard-sized globalists?
[00:28:24.233 --> 00:28:28.517]  So, a big huge globalist, a big huge lizard, or a hundred little tiny lizards?
[00:28:28.537 --> 00:28:31.020]  He's always making the joke, that's David Octavius' lizard people.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.661]  I think it's just psychopaths with lizard brains.
[00:28:33.162 --> 00:28:34.583]  But that's also like a Reddit thing.
[00:28:34.623 --> 00:28:37.746]  They always ask about a horse, or like if you would fight midgets or whatever.
[00:28:37.806 --> 00:28:38.847]  This is a classic.
[00:28:38.887 --> 00:28:39.588]  Maybe I'm dumb.
[00:28:39.628 --> 00:28:40.609]  See, I'm kind of a moron.
[00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.152]  A globalist sized lizard could be any size I wanted.
[00:28:45.113 --> 00:28:46.734]  So the question is, how big is a globalist?
[00:28:47.095 --> 00:28:47.575]  Exactly.
[00:28:48.416 --> 00:28:48.876]  Instead of a
[00:28:50.856 --> 00:28:52.157]  Hundred lizards of their size.
[00:28:52.357 --> 00:28:52.717]  Say it again?
[00:28:53.157 --> 00:28:53.397]  Okay.
[00:28:53.577 --> 00:28:55.758]  The question is... It's a key calculus.
[00:28:56.198 --> 00:28:56.719]  Exactly.
[00:28:57.499 --> 00:29:04.562]  Would you rather fight a globalist-sized lizard, big huge lizard, or a hundred lizard-sized globalist?
[00:29:04.582 --> 00:29:06.283]  So a bunch of little teeny tiny George Soroses.
[00:29:06.323 --> 00:29:06.783]  No, that's true.
[00:29:06.803 --> 00:29:10.525]  They're a bunch of small people that want total control.
[00:29:11.105 --> 00:29:13.066]  I mean, it's all the same thing.
[00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:16.488]  Globalists are conning themselves, thinking they've got full control of humanity.
[00:29:17.288 --> 00:29:26.420]  And so, I would rather humanity just wake up that globalism is a claim that somebody else controls everything, and you should just give them power in some far-off group.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.763]  So, I say bring all of them on.
[00:29:29.444 --> 00:29:29.724]  Both.
[00:29:30.024 --> 00:29:35.711]  Alex said he will fight both the globalist-sized lizard and the hundred-sized globalist at the same time, right?
[00:29:36.343 --> 00:29:39.125]  Well the truth is the global-sized lizard is not that big.
[00:29:42.067 --> 00:29:43.708]  Alex Jones, thank you for taking our questions.
[00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:51.353]  I'm just curious to know your thoughts on what you believe is the most plausible worst-case scenario you could conceive given all the information that you have.
[00:29:51.373 --> 00:29:53.255]  I gotta stop after this one because my back hurts.
[00:29:53.895 --> 00:29:57.278]  I gotta get Millie in here until the folks been waiting all day to take some phone calls.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.061]  Worst case scenario.
[00:30:01.683 --> 00:30:08.109]  Bill Gates came out two days ago and said give me world government and have Chelsea Clinton run it with her new book that came out.
[00:30:08.469 --> 00:30:14.675]  Let me forcibly inoculate everybody and make everybody pay me taxes or a bioweapon is gonna kill hundreds of millions of billions.
[00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:24.341]  And then he, meanwhile, spends billions on weather weapons and gut flora as they do everything they can to kill our... I mean, it's just... Think of, like, total psychopath.
[00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:27.182]  Fifty times Jeffrey Dahmer and you get Bill Gates.
[00:30:27.282 --> 00:30:30.263]  I mean, just... Power trip, super smart.
[00:30:30.343 --> 00:30:32.643]  He has a right to rule you and your family.
[00:30:32.663 --> 00:30:34.544]  What was the question?
[00:30:35.795 --> 00:30:38.719]  The question is, what's the most plausible worst case scenario?
[00:30:38.859 --> 00:30:39.840]  Oh yeah, I mean, that's it.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.703]  I mean, look, they're already going to have nanotech get loose, all sorts of stuff.
[00:30:42.723 --> 00:30:48.670]  Like, 70 years or 65 years ago, they had weaponized ticks with syphilis and Lyme disease.
[00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.492]  It's already ravaged most bunch of people I know.
[00:30:50.532 --> 00:30:53.776]  I mean, you know, that's like some ancient thing and it's just already spreading.
[00:30:53.816 --> 00:30:54.777]  God knows what it is.
[00:30:55.618 --> 00:30:58.241]  They've got AI computers running and most of us are dead already.
[00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:01.544]  And you know, the key is just getting people's spirits right with God.
[00:31:01.604 --> 00:31:02.345]  That's what matters.
[00:31:02.425 --> 00:31:05.028]  And so you ask what they're planning.
[00:31:05.088 --> 00:31:06.029]  I mean, they already did it.
[00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.213]  Worst case scenario is thermonuclear war, globalists in bunkers.
[00:31:10.233 --> 00:31:11.735]  But Bill Gates says, don't worry about that.
[00:31:12.215 --> 00:31:14.398]  Let me take control or bioweapons will kill you.
[00:31:14.498 --> 00:31:15.319]  I'm tax exempt.
[00:31:15.339 --> 00:31:18.002]  And my dad's a eugenist, Heil Hitler, you know.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.582]  Alright, well I'm not going to let it in on that note.
[00:31:20.862 --> 00:31:22.284]  So this is my question in the reddit.
[00:31:22.304 --> 00:31:23.165]  We'll do a few more too.
[00:31:23.245 --> 00:31:23.606]  No, no, no.
[00:31:23.646 --> 00:31:25.668]  What is the best case scenario?
[00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.589]  Where are we headed?
[00:31:26.609 --> 00:31:28.251]  What do you think is going to happen?
[00:31:28.732 --> 00:31:35.280]  If humanity wakes up and realizes the advanced technology we've developed and everything we've got within
[00:31:37.483 --> 00:31:38.944]  50 years, people don't die anymore.
[00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:54.642]  You can have copies of yourself, you can go on to the stars, you can launch unlimited with trillions of galaxies, space exploration programs, spread life to the universe like we were preceded here, and you can just join with God and promote life all over the universe.
[00:31:57.685 --> 00:32:00.349]  You know, in Stranger Aeon, even death may die.
[00:32:00.369 --> 00:32:01.231]  It's just unlimited.
[00:32:01.311 --> 00:32:02.272]  God's whole promise.
[00:32:02.893 --> 00:32:03.214]  Everything.
[00:32:03.234 --> 00:32:08.362]  We're ready just to bust like a seed pod into the galaxy, into the dimensions, and just spread life everywhere.
[00:32:08.402 --> 00:32:12.328]  But we have to be challenged by evil before we're given the keys to death and hell.
[00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:18.191]  Like Christ, you know, God's personification of this.
[00:32:18.911 --> 00:32:22.672]  You can't be given all this without resonating with God.
[00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:28.054]  You can't resonate with evil to use it to screw everyone over like Zuckerberg and people and Schmitt.
[00:32:28.094 --> 00:32:30.135]  You have to understand that it's about empowering people.
[00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:36.998]  Even when they hate you and attack you and are dumbed down, you can't hate where you came from and be given the keys to the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.552]  And so the sky's the limit.
[00:32:39.592 --> 00:32:40.252]  It's unlimited.
[00:32:41.193 --> 00:32:44.796]  Just like we live through generations, the next generation, we spiritually live on.
[00:32:44.836 --> 00:32:47.539]  Not through reincarnation, that's a globalist twist.
[00:32:47.959 --> 00:32:57.188]  We live through the genetics in one level, but our spirits, you know, live on through the species and what we've done and we resonate with God.
[00:32:57.668 --> 00:32:58.829]  It's like, do we want God?
[00:32:58.869 --> 00:32:59.490]  It's all free will.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:12.759 --> 00:37:16.341]  This is Millie Weaver and you're watching the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:32.150]  Well, today we have a very special guest today appearing with us via phone, Louis Buff Perry, who is a former intelligence advisor, a recognized and established codebreaker, and an occasional university instructor.
[00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:38.193]  Well, I wanted to get his take on the Tucker Carlson interview with a man named Brian
[00:37:38.633 --> 00:37:51.080]  Dean Wright who is a former CIA officer and it has come out saying that the intelligence agency or shadow parts of the intelligence agency is hiding information from President Trump.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:57.063]  So let's go ahead and look at a clip from this video really quick before we go in and ask Buff his take on it.
[00:37:57.972 --> 00:38:02.475]  There are these reports that are troubling that various agencies are withholding intel from the White House.
[00:38:02.495 --> 00:38:03.215]  Do you think those are true?
[00:38:03.676 --> 00:38:03.936]  I do.
[00:38:04.056 --> 00:38:07.258]  I think some things are being leaked to discredit the President.
[00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:07.618]  Yes.
[00:38:07.698 --> 00:38:10.901]  And then the second piece is I think some folks are holding, you know, information back.
[00:38:11.261 --> 00:38:12.321]  And that's deeply troubling.
[00:38:12.361 --> 00:38:13.582]  I think it should be for all of us.
[00:38:13.642 --> 00:38:14.783]  It's illegal too, isn't it?
[00:38:14.803 --> 00:38:15.464]  Well, of course, yeah.
[00:38:15.524 --> 00:38:17.185]  I mean, we start to get into grounds of treason.
[00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.469]  All right.
[00:38:18.509 --> 00:38:25.973]  Well, Buff, from your expertise and experience as a former intelligence advisor, what's your take on this?
[00:38:26.053 --> 00:38:27.514]  I mean, what do you think?
[00:38:27.574 --> 00:38:31.276]  Do you think that this is a coup attempt on President Donald Trump?
[00:38:31.356 --> 00:38:33.937]  And what can he do to stop this coup?
[00:38:36.119 --> 00:38:42.362]  Well, I think with Tucker Carlson to begin,
[00:38:43.671 --> 00:38:49.572]  I noted a very different series of expressions on his face and tone in his voice.
[00:38:50.533 --> 00:39:08.357]  This man in the interview, Tucker, was very disturbed by, I think, the implications of what it means when a former CIA officer comes forward saying that there's a split in the intelligence community and that
[00:39:10.171 --> 00:39:21.036]  The community has elements that are withholding what could very well be vital intelligence information from the President of the United States.
[00:39:21.096 --> 00:39:38.825]  Whatever anyone thinks of the new President of America, a President has to make quick decisions and to have this, especially in the time we're living, to have this happen is really quite dangerous.
[00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:50.575]  And if the intelligence community is split, that I think is the first place to start, you know, healing and working on some repair.
[00:39:51.156 --> 00:40:00.360]  Because we're headed for some really even rougher waters than we've been through over the last hundred years.
[00:40:01.681 --> 00:40:05.263]  And if the intelligence community is not on one page,
[00:40:06.112 --> 00:40:19.512]  And you've got people withholding information that could be so vital that it could allow for the intervention of a plot, of a terrorist act.
[00:40:21.132 --> 00:40:36.370]  Exactly, so basically because the intelligence community is so busy infighting amongst each other that you're basically saying that that could actually be a major national security threat because there could be terrorist attacks and other things that
[00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:43.513]  They're not necessarily seeing because they're too busy infighting and too busy trying to plot against President Trump.
[00:40:43.813 --> 00:40:47.575]  So, what would you advise President Trump to do?
[00:40:47.695 --> 00:40:56.679]  What's the best course of action when you have a rogue group in the CIA and other intelligence communities that's literally trying to run a coup?
[00:40:56.699 --> 00:41:04.563]  Well, if he hasn't already, I think he should be in touch with Brian Dean Wright and
[00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:17.671]  Hear Mr. Wright out on what Brian Dean Wright has stated to Tucker Carlson and what the background to all of that is.
[00:41:18.132 --> 00:41:32.084]  Surely there are officers, agents, and officials in intelligence who are briefing the President, but this man, Brian Dean Wright, is a member of the Democratic Party.
[00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:43.489]  And for him to come out, and if I understand this right, he wasn't a supporter of Donald Trump whatsoever.
[00:41:43.509 --> 00:41:50.111]  But for him to come out now, I think, okay, let's look at it this way.
[00:41:50.331 --> 00:42:03.355]  The timeliness is either very convenient or something major has happened in addition to the optics of division within the community.
[00:42:05.662 --> 00:42:32.853]  And we may not really know what that is, and may never know what that is, but in the meantime, it would serve the world well, I think, if there is stability, you know, in all three branches of government in America, dependability and predictability, because otherwise, you know, the shambles that would result are
[00:42:34.642 --> 00:43:03.224]  You know nightmarish and I don't I don't personally I I'm really hoping that that President Trump doesn't need to get into executive orders or presidential proclamations but it looks like it's moving in that direction and that's you know that's his one of one set of his solutions I honestly don't even know if you can legally have an executive order combined with the presidential proclamation
[00:43:04.215 --> 00:43:08.753]  But if you can, you know, even if you can't, he could do one or the other.
[00:43:09.793 --> 00:43:38.994]  So basically what you're saying is that, you know, with an executive order or a presidential proclamation he could make some kind of executive order under the guise of that there's rogue groups in these intelligence agencies and that they're neglecting their job as far as keeping the nation secure because they're too busy infighting and not to mention the fact that they're actually withholding information from the president which could lead to some type of a national disaster.
[00:43:39.594 --> 00:43:47.838]  You know, so what exactly would President Trump do in that scenario, and how do you think that would roll out?
[00:43:49.139 --> 00:43:58.524]  Well, an executive order can be overturned if the order lacks support by statute or the Constitution.
[00:43:59.885 --> 00:44:04.928]  If it's seen clearly that it is supported by the Constitution, then
[00:44:06.408 --> 00:44:09.969]  Whatever the president would initiate, he can follow through with.
[00:44:10.289 --> 00:44:25.373]  But if it is seen as not supported by the Constitution or by statute, but statute would require, you know, a whole lot more time than I think is probably available right now.
[00:44:26.973 --> 00:44:34.495]  So, you know, it would be best to have as many constitutional experts as he can muster.
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:47.705]  To quickly provide some opinions and interpretations on how it is that the Constitution could support his executive order.
[00:44:48.645 --> 00:44:59.450]  An executive order can decide how to and what degree of legislation will be enforced, especially dealing with emergencies.
[00:45:00.657 --> 00:45:27.829]  Well I know you were talking a little bit on, you know, if President Trump were to do an executive order that he would have to act fast and that there might be some way where he could actually do an executive order, act fast to make the actions necessary to remove these rogue elements in the CIA in time before they could actually go in and try to make a statute or overrule it, basically.
[00:45:29.644 --> 00:45:31.706]  It's my understanding that there is a period.
[00:45:31.766 --> 00:45:50.537]  He can assert the executive order, or initiate the executive order, and once applied, if it turns out to appear not to have support from the Constitution, because it probably wouldn't have it by statute because that would take a whole lot more time,
[00:45:54.594 --> 00:46:16.441]  Then, you know, I'm not an expert in the tripartite kind of complex of law here that would protect him to follow through with an executive order up to the point when it's deemed that it is not constitutionally supported.
[00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:20.811]  Well I want to thank Buff Perry for joining us here over the phone.
[00:46:20.831 --> 00:46:32.955]  It was a very enlightening conversation and I definitely want to hear more about his Code 19 and more about, you know, his takes from an inside point of view as a former intelligence advisor.
[00:46:32.995 --> 00:46:40.118]  So thank you so much Louis Buff Perry for joining us here and this is Millie Weaver signing off for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.512]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.532 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.055]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.075 --> 00:48:59.955]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.975 --> 00:49:00.015]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:11.411 --> 00:49:12.012]  They think differently.
[00:49:12.092 --> 00:49:14.054]  They feel differently.
[00:49:14.094 --> 00:49:19.180]  They look for God or find God in different ways.
[00:49:19.861 --> 00:49:28.010]  In this crowd, in this fan of religions, there is only one certainty that we have for all.
[00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.773]  We are all children of God.
[00:49:35.834 --> 00:49:45.797]  The Holy Father said today, notwithstanding new developments and the emergence of situations which are at times painful and even tragic, migration is still an aspiration to hope.
[00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:54.660]  The Pope noted that migration offers benefits both to the receiving nations and to the nations from which migrants come.
[00:50:02.629 --> 00:50:03.089]  Money!
[00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:03.910]  Money!
[00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:04.791]  Money!
[00:50:05.031 --> 00:50:13.418]  Pastoral workers play an important role through initiating dialogue, welcoming and assisting with legal issues, mediating with the local population.
[00:50:14.079 --> 00:50:21.785]  More than this, the Church is a source of hope for migrants, who often experience disappointment, distress and loneliness.
[00:50:22.346 --> 00:50:25.889]  And therefore, everyone is worthy of being welcomed and supported.
[00:50:31.957 --> 00:50:40.261]  He describes migration as a phenomenon, quote, which demands to be understood and confronted with sensitivity and a sense of justice.
[00:50:40.882 --> 00:50:46.825]  He calls on the church to proclaim and bear witness and reflect a spirit of charity while observing the law.
[00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:55.119]  Pope recalled that the attacks in Brussels were committed by young people born in Europe, but who'd not been integrated in society.
[00:50:55.739 --> 00:51:02.761]  He also recalled that one in ten Swedes is an immigrant or the son of immigrants, but they are perfectly integrated.
[00:51:02.881 --> 00:51:07.842]  There were immigrants to blame for this riot in Stockholm.
[00:51:08.442 --> 00:51:10.362]  There is an increased level of crime.
[00:51:10.482 --> 00:51:11.742]  Assaults are up, rapes are up.
[00:51:11.762 --> 00:51:14.663]  This is just according to police statistics in Sweden.
[00:51:16.957 --> 00:51:25.641]  Pope Francis is undoubtedly one of the biggest con men, one of the biggest frauds, one of the biggest liars in all of world history.
[00:51:27.262 --> 00:51:40.288]  He came out last year and said that it makes him basically nauseous to hear that Europe has Christian roots and shouldn't open itself up to the most radical, barbarous groups flooding out of the collapsing Middle East and North Africa.
[00:51:41.689 --> 00:51:43.210]  He's promoted a one world religion.
[00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:50.912]  He has attacked America's sovereignty and warned us that we shouldn't elect President Donald J. Trump.
[00:51:52.332 --> 00:51:58.894]  And now he's come out in a public statement and said, Islamic terrorism does not exist.
[00:51:59.994 --> 00:52:10.797]  Merkel, the embattled Chancellor of Germany, has also come out in the same weekend, just last weekend, and said it doesn't exist and we need, quote, more Muslim refugees.
[00:52:11.137 --> 00:52:13.818]  Yeah, a bunch of military-age men pouring into the country.
[00:52:14.755 --> 00:52:15.335]  Here's the article.
[00:52:15.375 --> 00:52:16.656]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:52:16.696 --> 00:52:21.037]  It links directly to Pope Francis' own statements released by the Vatican.
[00:52:21.298 --> 00:52:29.801]  Pope Francis declares Muslim terrorism, this is a quote, Muslim terrorism does not exist, close quote, as he continues to set the stage for a one world religion.
[00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:31.561]  What in the world is he thinking?
[00:52:32.362 --> 00:52:39.704]  Michael Schneider writing says, when I first started seeing headlines that claimed Pope Francis said that Muslim terrorism does not exist, I thought that couldn't possibly be true.
[00:52:39.764 --> 00:52:43.226]  After all, who could possibly deny that Islamic radicals are engaged in terrorism?
[00:52:43.766 --> 00:52:48.548]  In the last 30 days, there have been 127 Islamic terror attacks in a total of 25 nations.
[00:52:48.908 --> 00:52:53.350]  And in 2016, global terror attacks set an all-time record high, were up 25% from the year before.
[00:52:54.730 --> 00:53:03.324]  And he goes through Christians being slaughtered, the UN admitting there's an epidemic of it, what happened in Libya, Syria, with hundreds of thousands of Christians being killed or displaced.
[00:53:03.805 --> 00:53:07.651]  And Pope Francis sits there arrogantly saying it doesn't exist.
[00:53:09.758 --> 00:53:19.142]  Just like we don't see people in New York yesterday at a women's march doing the call to prayer, or women putting on hijabs in D.C.
[00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:26.645]  or Berlin, or just like we don't see all these weird, bizarre Islamic groups actually leading the protest and demonstrations.
[00:53:26.725 --> 00:53:37.610]  No, we know the left and the globalists have allied themselves in an unholy alliance with Islam, Wahhabist Sunni Islam out of Saudi Arabia, and that they are the destabilization force
[00:53:39.804 --> 00:53:41.945]  That is supposedly going to, quote, repopulate Europe.
[00:53:42.985 --> 00:54:02.411]  So the globalists take over Europe and the U.S., teach us not to have kids, then destabilize the Middle East, open up the borders, and bring in the most oppressive anti-family, anti-woman, anti-Christian groups you can imagine, who dress their little kids up with suicide bombs and have them march in and blow up Christian churches.
[00:54:03.131 --> 00:54:03.851]  It's unbelievable.
[00:54:04.332 --> 00:54:05.152]  This Pope
[00:54:06.417 --> 00:54:11.565]  Say what you want about Catholics of the past, but this Pope used blackmail dealing with pedophilia.
[00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:17.151]  In the Vatican to overtake it and overthrow the church and bring their system in.
[00:54:17.631 --> 00:54:31.354]  And the good news is not just conservative Catholics but Catholics across the board are almost unanimously in leadership opposing him because he is a monster meant to destroy one of the oldest Christian institutions in the world.
[00:54:32.114 --> 00:54:33.414]  The West is on its deathbed.
[00:54:34.054 --> 00:54:38.075]  The globalists want it to fall before they bring in their technotronic global tyranny.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:49.326]  And instead of the West falling, it's time for parasites like Pope Francis to fall politically where everyone completely recognizes what a monster he is.
[00:54:49.927 --> 00:54:52.028]  They say the devil is the father of lies.
[00:54:53.429 --> 00:54:59.173]  Well, I ask you, is it true that Islamic terror does not exist?
[00:55:01.174 --> 00:55:02.435]  Is the Pope telling you the truth?
[00:55:03.555 --> 00:55:05.637]  Or is the Pope lying to you?
[00:55:06.778 --> 00:55:07.958]  And clearly, he's lying.
[00:55:08.379 --> 00:55:09.739]  Not just here, but in many other ways.
[00:55:10.359 --> 00:55:23.143]  He believes you will take his office, speaking ex-Cathedra, and will then accept a great delusion, like Revelations talks about, and a great lie, all because the father, or the Pontiff, told you so.
[00:55:24.583 --> 00:55:25.464]  Well, he is a father.
[00:55:26.584 --> 00:55:32.766]  He's a father of lies, and he's a son of Baphomet, by any measurement.
[00:55:39.426 --> 00:55:42.089]  I kind of wish sometimes the CIA was giving me orders.
[00:55:43.811 --> 00:55:45.612]  Because then you'd know what to do, or what do you mean?
[00:55:45.632 --> 00:55:46.613]  No, they don't know what to do.
[00:55:46.633 --> 00:55:47.615]  They're a bunch of idiots.
[00:55:47.675 --> 00:55:50.457]  It's like, oh my god, I'm with a big corrupt group.
[00:55:50.477 --> 00:55:53.781]  They're like... Oh, because it'd be easy, because then you'd just be mainstream media.
[00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:59.507]  You could just read off... You know, the only family I knew that did stuff for the CIA said, you're on target, it's evil, fight them.
[00:56:00.527 --> 00:56:03.509]  It wasn't like, you know, it wasn't like, oh, let's go join with it.
[00:56:03.529 --> 00:56:04.709]  It's like they're soulless.
[00:56:04.729 --> 00:56:05.510]  They use you.
[00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:06.370]  It's horrible things.
[00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:07.991]  Well, it is like the Captain America movie.
[00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:18.796]  We, when we all went to review, I think it was the second one that came out and that's what it was that they, they were, they discovered that it was the higher ups that were doing evil.
[00:56:19.256 --> 00:56:26.204]  Well, if you notice, the main thing that they use as a strategy is character assassination.
[00:56:26.564 --> 00:56:29.247]  And if you notice, what did they use to take out Flynn?
[00:56:29.707 --> 00:56:31.449]  In a sense, it was character assassination.
[00:56:31.489 --> 00:56:37.255]  Because if the American people said, we don't really care about some conversations, so what?
[00:56:37.315 --> 00:56:39.838]  He should be trying to remove these sanctions.
[00:56:40.258 --> 00:56:41.620]  Then it wouldn't be a big deal.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.683]  They would show him a show to a meeting early and be getting his things ready and not not being arrogant.
[00:56:47.883 --> 00:56:48.083]  Yeah.
[00:56:48.163 --> 00:56:50.944]  Look how look how awkward he looks.
[00:56:51.324 --> 00:56:52.485]  He's there 30 minutes early.
[00:56:52.785 --> 00:56:52.945]  Yeah.
[00:56:52.965 --> 00:56:53.645]  He didn't care.
[00:56:53.685 --> 00:56:54.966]  And there's no entourage around him.
[00:56:55.326 --> 00:56:56.507]  He's sitting down getting ready.
[00:56:56.847 --> 00:56:57.767]  He was like focus.
[00:56:57.807 --> 00:57:00.448]  So it's like he's not an arrogant narcissist.
[00:57:00.909 --> 00:57:01.629]  We can't have him.
[00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:07.454]  They used character assassination to take down people on Trump's side, like Milo Yiannopoulos.
[00:57:07.494 --> 00:57:09.256]  I'm not going to say it, they had a database.
[00:57:09.316 --> 00:57:12.699]  They knew Flynn, listened to the show, they knew he was tweeting.
[00:57:12.719 --> 00:57:13.660]  It was Flynn.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.261]  Flynn told Trump how great I was.
[00:57:21.847 --> 00:57:23.448]  And so that's exactly it.
[00:57:23.488 --> 00:57:27.491]  They're using the character assassinations to take out the people on Trump's side.
[00:57:27.511 --> 00:57:36.957]  But at the same time, Hillary Clinton had so many things come out on her, and it didn't matter how much character assassination would have been out there.
[00:57:36.977 --> 00:57:38.218]  Nothing stuck.
[00:57:38.338 --> 00:57:39.238]  Nothing happened.
[00:57:39.278 --> 00:57:40.099]  She's still there.
[00:57:40.339 --> 00:57:43.161]  Who was the head of defense intelligence like six years ago, start listening.
[00:57:43.181 --> 00:57:46.764]  Because he's there hearing what we're saying on air, and that's what's real.
[00:57:47.064 --> 00:57:48.525]  They were like investigating us.
[00:57:48.585 --> 00:57:51.107]  They had the military watching us.
[00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:52.868]  How does Alex Jones know all this?
[00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:53.528]  Yeah.
[00:57:53.568 --> 00:57:54.569]  They'll tell people big secrets.
[00:57:54.609 --> 00:57:55.950]  Well, because I'm dialed in, man.
[00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:57.291]  I'm not out to get humanity.
[00:57:57.331 --> 00:57:59.573]  God is like, you know, giving us the data.
[00:57:59.933 --> 00:58:02.495]  And so Flynn and the whole military listened.
[00:58:02.515 --> 00:58:05.517]  They're like, this guy knows everything that's happening because I could watch it.
[00:58:05.817 --> 00:58:06.758]  Plus I had sources.
[00:58:07.418 --> 00:58:14.881]  And so that's what's happened is there the military said we want this we want they're like what is that that's being loving God.
[00:58:15.721 --> 00:58:17.262]  If you want to know the big secrets that's it.
[00:58:17.322 --> 00:58:26.105]  Well and that's and you're absolutely right just like you were you were there at the inauguration and you said what Trump was gonna say before he even said it because it's that is.
[00:58:26.165 --> 00:58:26.905]  I knew I knew.
[00:58:27.225 --> 00:58:34.490]  That's what's the magic about us and our humanity and they want, that's why we've got the fluoride, that's why we've got all the television programs.
[00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:35.151]  To suppress it.
[00:58:35.191 --> 00:58:36.172]  Because we're dialed into each other.
[00:58:36.392 --> 00:58:38.093]  They want us to be jammed.
[00:58:38.133 --> 00:58:43.757]  They want to jam our signals so that we won't trust our intuition, that we won't dig deep, we won't go inside, we won't connect.
[00:58:43.797 --> 00:58:45.999]  God isn't going to let the globalists do this alone.
[00:58:46.019 --> 00:58:47.220]  He's going to give us a chance to fight.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.421]  It's the free will world.
[00:58:48.461 --> 00:58:51.523]  We live in a free will world though.
[00:58:51.583 --> 00:58:54.685]  So we have to choose to be free.
[00:58:55.626 --> 00:58:56.767]  Thanks to everybody that tuned in.
