[00:00:01.771 --> 00:00:17.708]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:33.550]  I tell you, I have giant piles of riveting, key, amazing news.
[00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.232]  But I gotta kick this broadcast off with our big story yesterday.
[00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:49.955]  Atlantic Monthly, the elite East Coast leftist establishment, Blue Blood, Robert Barron publication that puts out the talking points more than even the New York Times.
[00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:57.698]  I mean, this is read by the elite for the elite, saying they're organizing and looking and preparing a continual government overthrow of President Trump.
[00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:00.158]  I've looked at all the angles of that.
[00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:02.960]  That would be done violently.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.083]  They're not going to let Trump again be there to speak for himself or stand up to the liars.
[00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:20.192]  So I'm going to take the interview and the breakdowns that I did yesterday and repost those to the front page of InfoWars.com in the next 30 minutes so listeners that thought that was important can get my special report where I break all that down after everybody you know.
[00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.255]  Because we're not just about passively telling the audience about what's happening, what's unfolding.
[00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:27.596]  You're giving us info.
[00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:28.577]  We're giving you info.
[00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:29.918]  We're working together.
[00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:33.642]  We're restoring the Republic, one mind at a time, and it's happening.
[00:01:33.642 --> 00:01:34.823]  Wow!
[00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:45.414]  Remember of the different New York Times articles I've shown, one that we've shown probably the most, probably second, because there's that one with the headline on January 20th with Roger Stone and
[00:01:46.592 --> 00:01:54.216]  Paul Manafort and the rest of it saying they were wiretapped at Trump Tower, they were talking to the Russians, and then of course they weren't.
[00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:56.978]  And the Trumps said, that's illegal to leak that, even though it's not true.
[00:01:56.978 --> 00:01:58.859]  They went, oh we never said that.
[00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:07.443]  Well, there was this headline, Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence of Russian election hacking, had the intelligence, and then gave it to the press.
[00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:14.887]  That's the New York Times Matthew Rosenberg, who goes on MSNBC and CNN and says, I'm crazy, I made this up.
[00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:17.262]  Well, guess what?
[00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:32.719]  Top Obama administration official, the head of the entire Russian program at the State Department, Evelyn Farkas, Paul is such a journalist, he said, did Obama's defense deputy just admit spying on Trump?
[00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.681]  Do bears go potty in the woods?
[00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:38.767]  Does that woman look like a bug-eyed warmonger?
[00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:39.948]  Absolutely.
[00:02:39.948 --> 00:02:49.133]  They're on the morning, morning, morning jihad against Russia program with Mika Brzezinski, whose father's life is sworn to destroy Russia in his own books, he admits it.
[00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:51.874]  See, nobody knows the background of who you're looking at here.
[00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:56.496]  These are total Russia-phobes that want to conquer Russia, mount Russia's head on the wall.
[00:02:56.496 --> 00:03:02.159]  But they hate us even more, why the globalists came here to take over, so they can dominate the world using our strength.
[00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.320]  They want Russia for that as well.
[00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:11.250]  Look what the Bolsheviks did out of New York and London, 1917, once they got control of Russia, turned it into a giant engine of evil.
[00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.971]  And they want what was theirs back again.
[00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:17.472]  You slaves will never escape the Trotskyites.
[00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:18.172]  Like Chomsky.
[00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:20.273]  I'm going to get to him in a minute.
[00:03:20.273 --> 00:03:21.413]  But here it is.
[00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:27.875]  Oh, she says, oh, he rushed to save the intelligence that we had on them, the proof they're Russian agents, and distributed it.
[00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.196]  This is on MSNBC.
[00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:32.237]  Saying exactly what was in the New York Times.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.946]  It's just simply incredible.
[00:03:39.946 --> 00:03:44.551]  This was back on the 19th of January.
[00:03:44.551 --> 00:03:46.513]  The next day they come out and say wiretaps.
[00:03:46.513 --> 00:03:47.635]  They say they have transcripts.
[00:03:48.817 --> 00:03:52.298]  I don't want to beat this horse to death, but you know what happened.
[00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.018]  I know what happened.
[00:03:54.018 --> 00:03:56.499]  You know Obamacare isn't free, even though they told you it would be.
[00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:57.819]  You know it doubled and tripled premiums.
[00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.120]  It was a giant screwjob.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.500]  But still, the sheeple don't know that.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.981]  You've got to reach out to them.
[00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:05.362]  They're being told that Trump did Obamacare.
[00:04:05.362 --> 00:04:07.442]  That it's his fault that he wrote it and passed it.
[00:04:07.442 --> 00:04:07.902]  Literally!
[00:04:07.902 --> 00:04:09.983]  They're on the news saying it's his fault, now he owns...
[00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:11.323]  Obamacare.
[00:04:11.323 --> 00:04:13.724]  You've got to remind folks you're not a goldfish.
[00:04:13.724 --> 00:04:16.225]  Obamacare is Obama.
[00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:18.046]  That's why it's called Obamacare.
[00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:19.486]  And I know you think I'm being sarcastic.
[00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:21.407]  I'm not.
[00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:24.488]  When they say vaccines have never hurt anyone, they're totally safe.
[00:04:24.488 --> 00:04:25.629]  Remember the Sesame Street Show?
[00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.509]  I said, kids, get all your shots.
[00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:28.750]  No one's ever been hurt.
[00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.930]  It's totally safe.
[00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.811]  Every insert says it can kill you.
[00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:35.192]  I have news today of Gardasil paralyzing more people in mainstream news.
[00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:39.074]  But again, the Muppets for little kids say it's totally safe.
[00:04:40.882 --> 00:04:53.219]  But what I'm getting at here is what's old news to you is new to other folks when you have the former head of the State Department's operation against Russia saying, yes, we were spying on Trump.
[00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.120]  On video.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.142]  It's bombshell.
[00:04:55.142 --> 00:04:56.444]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:04:56.444 --> 00:04:57.345]  So much more coming up.
[00:04:57.345 --> 00:04:57.785]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.322]  Uber self-driving vehicle involved in Arizona crash.
[00:05:04.322 --> 00:05:08.665]  This is an article from Bloomberg linked on Infowars.com.
[00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:15.909]  A self-driving car operated by Uber Technologies Incorporated was involved in a crash in Tempe, Arizona.
[00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.612]  The latest setback for a company reeling from multiple crises.
[00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:30.481]  In a photo posted on Twitter, one of Uber's Volvo self-driving SUVs is pictured on its side next to another car with dense and smashed windows.
[00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:36.066]  An Uber spokeswoman confirmed the incident, as well as the veracity of the photo.
[00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:42.431]  Uber, as well as its chief executive officer, are under scrutiny because of a series of scandals.
[00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:47.252]  The ride-hailing company has been accused of operating a sexist workplace.
[00:05:47.252 --> 00:05:55.675]  The New York Times reported that Uber used a tool called Greyball to help drivers evade government regulators and enforcement officials.
[00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:58.376]  This is Ashley Beckford for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.160]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.764]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:08.764 --> 00:06:11.926]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:21.713]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:22.553]  Caveman.
[00:06:22.553 --> 00:06:27.617]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:27.617 --> 00:06:29.738]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:30.018 --> 00:06:33.179]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:38.321]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:38.321 --> 00:06:46.464]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:46.464 --> 00:06:54.407]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:54.407 --> 00:06:59.049]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[00:07:00.984 --> 00:07:06.467]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:07.307]  I take this.
[00:07:07.307 --> 00:07:08.428]  My family takes this.
[00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:12.730]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.192]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:21.955]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:23.095]  I don't feel good.
[00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:26.617]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:29.539]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:35.343]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:07:35.343 --> 00:07:38.304]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:41.846]  And I know my hair's a little luxurious once again.
[00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:44.068]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:07:44.068 --> 00:07:44.428]  I love it.
[00:07:44.588 --> 00:07:47.392]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:07:47.392 --> 00:07:48.413]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:48.413 --> 00:07:54.040]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.243]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:58.446]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:08:17.774 --> 00:08:24.297]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:24.297 --> 00:08:28.979]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:30.720]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:42.486]  Obama administration officials have gone from arrogantly admitting they were spying on Trump to denying it and saying it's totally insane and calling for the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes, to resign.
[00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:53.803]  Because he dared go talk to the president and confer and show him more documentation of exactly who was illegally spying on him and then leaking it.
[00:08:53.803 --> 00:09:03.067]  Because they can spy on foreign leaders while the president-elect's talking to them, but you can't be then sharing that information domestically or giving it to the press.
[00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:05.368]  Well, now we have video.
[00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:14.032]  Last night on MSNBC, Obama's defense deputy just admitted spying on Trump.
[00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:30.856]  The former Assistant Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas, also son of the State Department, has caused controversy after she appeared to admit during an interview on MSNBC that Obama administration spied on Donald Trump's transition team in order to gain intelligence for political use.
[00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:31.596]  Excuse me!
[00:09:33.988 --> 00:09:36.429]  Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:40.751]  If you're a radio listener, I'll give you the headline, but here it is from March 1st.
[00:09:40.751 --> 00:09:43.752]  It was also reported in January in the New York Times.
[00:09:43.752 --> 00:09:45.253]  The exact same headline.
[00:09:45.253 --> 00:09:53.536]  Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence of Russian election hacking, including spying on the president.
[00:09:53.536 --> 00:09:55.397]  The incoming president.
[00:09:55.397 --> 00:09:58.258]  They admitted all that.
[00:09:58.258 --> 00:10:00.499]  But the reason I go back to this, I'm going to play that clip coming up.
[00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:07.383]  Is it illustrates just again the fact that they think you have no memory.
[00:10:07.383 --> 00:10:12.224]  They think that you are a complete and total absolute moron.
[00:10:12.224 --> 00:10:13.944]  Let me just do this.
[00:10:13.944 --> 00:10:17.805]  It's kind of a game I've been playing for decades and I've never actually done it successfully.
[00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:22.886]  But let me just try to maybe cover 50 headlines of what's coming up so you get an idea.
[00:10:22.886 --> 00:10:24.326]  Let's just start here.
[00:10:24.326 --> 00:10:25.906]  Then I'll go back to more detail.
[00:10:25.906 --> 00:10:26.786]  Chomsky.
[00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:29.947]  Trump may stage false flag terror attack to rally support.
[00:10:31.408 --> 00:10:34.471]  We're going to respond to that.
[00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:36.112]  I thought false flags didn't exist, Chomsky.
[00:10:36.112 --> 00:10:37.893]  You say I'm crazy.
[00:10:37.893 --> 00:10:39.535]  Fear of Trump Planet.
[00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:42.437]  Anthony Frida, articleinfowars.com.
[00:10:42.437 --> 00:10:53.246]  Very powerful, and it actually dovetails with Michael Moore says Trump will cause human extinction, even though he's promoting not having families, not having kids.
[00:10:53.246 --> 00:10:57.410]  Roger Stone's new Netflix doc, with yours truly in it, premiering at Tribeca Film Fest.
[00:11:02.708 --> 00:11:04.829]  We're gonna get into Census.
[00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:10.193]  Immigration to bust 100-year record continues surging.
[00:11:10.193 --> 00:11:16.276]  Student has grade docked for using mankind in English paper.
[00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:20.179]  We're getting a whole bunch of Hollywood propaganda and garbage coming out.
[00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:20.879]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:23.601]  This is out of the Daily Mail.
[00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:28.844]  HPV vaccine paralyzes 12-year-old aspiring pop star.
[00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:31.146]  I just mentioned this yesterday.
[00:11:32.188 --> 00:11:34.768]  And look, it's in the news today.
[00:11:34.768 --> 00:11:36.329]  I mean, it's in the news every day.
[00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:38.349]  They admit it's paralyzed and killed.
[00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:43.290]  Killed thousands we know of in the United States alone.
[00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.091]  Japan and India banned it after one year.
[00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:49.551]  Mexico's made it compulsory.
[00:11:49.551 --> 00:11:50.811]  Just, it's such a huge issue.
[00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:52.812]  You wanna know who the boogeyman is?
[00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:59.253]  It's not it, the clown, coming to get you kids out from underneath the bed at night or out of the stir pipe.
[00:11:59.253 --> 00:11:59.393]  It's...
[00:12:01.408 --> 00:12:03.949]  The Globalist, right out in plain view.
[00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:06.011]  That's just some of the news there.
[00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:11.274]  Felony charges for two who secretly filmed Planned Parenthood saying they violated medical rights.
[00:12:11.274 --> 00:12:15.256]  But you see, if you're a whistleblower showing other crime, you're protected, but it doesn't matter.
[00:12:15.256 --> 00:12:19.639]  They've been charged with felonies in California.
[00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:23.121]  Bob Dylan to receive Nobel Prize in Stockholm.
[00:12:24.312 --> 00:12:28.314]  Nobel Prize, I wouldn't accept the Nobel Prize if they gave it to Al Gore or Henry Kissinger.
[00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:35.239]  Oh, I forgot, Obama, before he was even President-Elect, he's launched all these wars.
[00:12:35.239 --> 00:12:38.861]  Oh, toddler burned by coffee at Eastside Starbucks airlifted to the hospital.
[00:12:41.834 --> 00:12:43.095]  That's just some of the news here.
[00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:46.677]  I'm not going in the order of importance.
[00:12:46.677 --> 00:12:48.499]  It's all important.
[00:12:48.499 --> 00:12:49.680]  Sky News data.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.440]  Brexit poll.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.122]  Half of Britain's happy about EU divorce.
[00:12:53.122 --> 00:12:53.602]  Proceeding.
[00:12:53.602 --> 00:13:02.649]  They're moving forward officially with a split from the EU, who's threatened them with economic Armageddon.
[00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:03.649]  Oh, that ties into this.
[00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:04.230]  Trump bump.
[00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.112]  Consumer confidence hits 16-year high.
[00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:08.473]  Housing prices rise.
[00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:13.000]  Best small business numbers since 1984.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.922]  But don't worry, they tried for 8 days to drive down the stock market.
[00:13:15.922 --> 00:13:18.124]  They started failing yesterday and went back up.
[00:13:18.124 --> 00:13:19.465]  But they are trying.
[00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.746]  And admitting they're trying.
[00:13:20.746 --> 00:13:21.987]  Because they're the good guys.
[00:13:21.987 --> 00:13:27.171]  They're the big mega-banks who want you poor so they can control your life.
[00:13:27.171 --> 00:13:36.579]  They don't care that Goldman Sachs made record profits just since Trump got in off of a rising stock market because they want you to be poor.
[00:13:36.579 --> 00:13:38.801]  It's called greedy scumbaggery.
[00:13:39.991 --> 00:13:40.831]  It's called feudalism.
[00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:43.213]  In fact, it's the most popular system of government in history.
[00:13:43.213 --> 00:13:44.793]  The elite's keeping you poor to control you.
[00:13:44.793 --> 00:13:52.757]  And that ties into UN advisor claims Trump won't last four years in office.
[00:13:52.757 --> 00:13:56.759]  German Prime Minister says Erdogan a terrorism godfather.
[00:13:56.759 --> 00:14:00.081]  Yeah, you can take what's happened with the Communist Chinese.
[00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:00.981]  In fact, I didn't get to the Shashti.
[00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:01.421]  I should have.
[00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:01.862]  I mentioned it.
[00:14:01.862 --> 00:14:03.623]  Well, you guys pull it out of the stack.
[00:14:03.623 --> 00:14:05.463]  It was an InfoWars article linking to French news.
[00:14:05.463 --> 00:14:06.264]  Didn't get any coverage here.
[00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:25.345]  A bunch of articles yesterday about Erdogan again and his foreign minister saying to Europe, you will do whatever we say politically with us, you will give us all this aid, you will open your borders further to us, or we will activate, it's over 5 million Turks conservatively just in
[00:14:26.564 --> 00:14:29.465]  What, five different major European countries?
[00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:30.206]  That's an old number.
[00:14:30.206 --> 00:14:32.907]  Guys, look up the number of Turks living in Europe, please.
[00:14:32.907 --> 00:14:34.468]  Western Europe.
[00:14:34.468 --> 00:14:38.830]  The point is, he said, we will activate them and they will burn down every city.
[00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.572]  We will launch a holy war, or that translates, Jihad.
[00:14:43.735 --> 00:14:52.957]  So, oh, have the Turk nationals in, and then have them directed by their Islamist leader, because they let the Turks in the last 50 years because they weren't the radical Muslims.
[00:14:52.957 --> 00:15:02.278]  In fact, they were the old Christians that got overrun by the Muslims when the Western Empire of the old Holy Roman Empire finally fell.
[00:15:02.278 --> 00:15:05.779]  That'd be the Eastern Empire, excuse me.
[00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:10.040]  Constantinople.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.720]  Which is now
[00:15:12.398 --> 00:15:14.879]  What's Constantinople now?
[00:15:14.879 --> 00:15:17.561]  The capital of Turkey, Istanbul.
[00:15:17.561 --> 00:15:20.902]  And everybody goes and goes, look at the incredible architecture of the Muslims.
[00:15:20.902 --> 00:15:25.705]  Those are churches, like the Blue Mosque.
[00:15:25.705 --> 00:15:27.946]  Oh, but they're friends now!
[00:15:27.946 --> 00:15:31.308]  Oh, let them all in!
[00:15:31.308 --> 00:15:32.308]  And then, boom!
[00:15:32.308 --> 00:15:36.070]  We will burn your cities!
[00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:41.153]  Turkish dictator Erdogan threatened Europe on the same day the London attack by terrorist scum.
[00:15:43.612 --> 00:15:44.433]  Think about that.
[00:15:44.433 --> 00:15:50.537]  See, I say I never go through the whole stack without stopping, but it's hard to do.
[00:15:50.537 --> 00:15:53.659]  Here's a big one that I'll be covering.
[00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:57.241]  In battle, DNC asks all staffers for resignation letters.
[00:15:57.241 --> 00:15:59.663]  Major reorganization of the Democratic Party underway.
[00:15:59.663 --> 00:16:01.164]  NBC News.
[00:16:01.164 --> 00:16:07.908]  So when the Democrats fire everybody, because there's such a boatload of trash,
[00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:13.049]  And anti-American scum, but they're failures.
[00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:16.771]  They're going to bring in an even worse group, you better believe it.
[00:16:16.771 --> 00:16:23.075]  It's totally normal to fire everyone, but when Trump has 40, was it 3 or 6 of the U.S.
[00:16:23.075 --> 00:16:26.496]  attorneys fired, Bill Clinton fired 93, that was totally normal.
[00:16:26.496 --> 00:16:34.480]  But when Trump starts kicking out Democrats, oh, it's unheard of, the outrage!
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.242]  Excuse me for breathing.
[00:16:38.242 --> 00:16:39.743]  Again, that's how stupid they think you are.
[00:16:41.963 --> 00:16:42.543]  Are you that dumb?
[00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:43.184]  Let's see.
[00:16:43.184 --> 00:16:43.704]  There it is.
[00:16:43.704 --> 00:16:44.665]  Oh!
[00:16:44.665 --> 00:16:45.446]  Battle DNC.
[00:16:45.446 --> 00:16:48.128]  Ask all stabbers for resignation.
[00:16:48.128 --> 00:16:48.588]  White House.
[00:16:48.588 --> 00:16:57.035]  Trump was right on the, this came out last week with more news from the police, on the Jewish Center bomb threats.
[00:16:57.035 --> 00:17:00.477]  And it turns out it was a young Jewish man.
[00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:06.082]  Spencer went on to say those who accuse the right of being behind the attacks need to be called out.
[00:17:07.811 --> 00:17:15.556]  And it turns out that a 19-year-old Jewish man named Michael Kadar, who had dual Israeli citizenship and was of course a big leftist, was behind it.
[00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:30.284]  Because you need to say that the Trump supporters are putting swastikas up and knocking over Jewish cemeteries because that's why he's married into an Orthodox Jewish family and has Jewish grandkids because he's so anti-Semitic.
[00:17:30.284 --> 00:17:31.745]  But it never ends, does it?
[00:17:32.754 --> 00:17:34.035]  It just never ends.
[00:17:34.035 --> 00:17:35.755]  The false flags never end.
[00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:37.696]  And that's what the left is so famous for.
[00:17:37.696 --> 00:17:46.621]  And that brings me now, before we go to break, to Noam Chomsky.
[00:17:46.621 --> 00:17:50.022]  Trump may stage false flag terror attack to rally support.
[00:17:50.022 --> 00:17:54.704]  Now, controlled corporate media always makes a joke about me and says that I say every terror attack is a false flag.
[00:17:54.704 --> 00:17:57.486]  Well, I introduced false flag in the last
[00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.690]  18 years or so.
[00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:11.217]  I didn't really cover it a lot the first few years before 9-11 even happened because Oklahoma City 19 years ago or 20 years ago now, man, was a false flag.
[00:18:11.217 --> 00:18:13.199]  We had the newscast, the police.
[00:18:13.199 --> 00:18:14.279]  I interviewed them all.
[00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:16.781]  They saw the feds by name planting bombs.
[00:18:16.781 --> 00:18:17.982]  The feds said they weren't there.
[00:18:17.982 --> 00:18:19.403]  I guess I got to skip the break.
[00:18:19.403 --> 00:18:22.125]  They were planting bombs.
[00:18:22.125 --> 00:18:23.005]  They said they weren't there.
[00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:27.428]  We got their hotel receipts.
[00:18:27.428 --> 00:18:28.129]  It all unfolded.
[00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:32.545]  We know by name who planted the bombs.
[00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:33.566]  People saw them doing it.
[00:18:33.566 --> 00:18:34.647]  They said, what are you doing?
[00:18:34.647 --> 00:18:36.829]  Oh, we're doing telephone work.
[00:18:36.829 --> 00:18:43.074]  She said, you don't like telephone repairmen.
[00:18:43.074 --> 00:18:46.877]  And we had her on Jane Graham many times.
[00:18:46.877 --> 00:18:48.878]  We've had other witnesses on.
[00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:53.662]  Gray sticks of butter in the stairwell areas.
[00:18:53.662 --> 00:18:55.884]  And she would go up and down it for exercise at lunch.
[00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:58.026]  They were in there on the days before, wiring it all in.
[00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:11.592]  And it better be the police officers, head of the K-9 unit and many others that they didn't kill, like Terrence Yakey, who was cop of the year and the first to respond.
[00:19:11.592 --> 00:19:27.715]  And so, yes, there are pure staged events, false flags, where you use a sheep-dipped guy like Tim McVeigh, put into special CIA operations in the Army, who was then pissed off they were actually going to bomb a nursery, and said, I'm not part of this, so you saw what they did to him.
[00:19:29.189 --> 00:19:32.672]  They were going to burn Elohim City that was being run by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:37.075]  These are nasty people, folks.
[00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:47.003]  But then Chomsky, the pseudo-intellectual funded by the big foundations, comes out and tells you that Trump's going to stage a terror attack with no proof, no nothing.
[00:19:47.003 --> 00:19:55.069]  And so I have a comment on Steve Watson's article that's up on Infowars.com that deals with all of this.
[00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:55.689]  It's at the bottom.
[00:19:56.809 --> 00:20:08.156]  The real false flag is opening Europe up to Islamic invaders, 5 million plus, and then using that crisis to revoke the liberties and freedoms of the people in those nations who are fighting for their very survival.
[00:20:08.156 --> 00:20:16.261]  The real false flag is allowing thousands of unvetted Islamists as refugees in the United States with the same aim, to merge the left with Islamofascism.
[00:20:18.163 --> 00:20:33.995]  And use the incompatibility of orthodox Islam to force us to have political correctness Sharia light laws to not stir up the Muslims, which they now are openly saying and doing.
[00:20:33.995 --> 00:20:35.196]  Isn't that just darling?
[00:20:38.066 --> 00:20:43.268]  Chomsky, Trump may stage false flag terror attack to rally support.
[00:20:43.268 --> 00:20:47.050]  Incident could be blamed on vulnerable people.
[00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:54.274]  The 5 million jihadis that are in Europe, 80% military age men, brought in by Merkel, opened up, 3 million more in North Africa ready to come in.
[00:20:54.274 --> 00:21:00.157]  The EU ordering countries, they'll be fined hundreds of thousands of euros per refugee they don't let in.
[00:21:00.157 --> 00:21:03.138]  Since when does the UN and the EU run those countries?
[00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:07.060]  Since they announced they'll march an EU army in and take over any military that doesn't submit.
[00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:09.210]  The arrogance.
[00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:10.812]  But people are rolling over.
[00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.274]  The cuckold.
[00:21:12.274 --> 00:21:12.755]  Germans.
[00:21:12.755 --> 00:21:14.617]  The cuckold French.
[00:21:14.617 --> 00:21:15.919]  The cucksters.
[00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:19.283]  People that are in to being cucked.
[00:21:19.283 --> 00:21:20.485]  And what is cucking, folks?
[00:21:21.707 --> 00:21:26.310]  It's getting into being dominated and controlled, getting into being subservient.
[00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.231]  It's Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:36.535]  It's watching 10 guys line up right in front of you and gangbang your wife and tell you you're a little piece of nothing right in front of you.
[00:21:36.535 --> 00:21:38.076]  A lot of men get into it.
[00:21:38.076 --> 00:21:40.638]  And that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:40.638 --> 00:21:48.062]  This is a cuckold West that bows down to these nobodies, these pseudo-intellectuals like Chomsky.
[00:21:49.991 --> 00:22:02.676]  Who only tells you about one spectrum of the control system, and then he sits there when Trump has the whole power structure against him, and is actually trying to deliver real prosperity to the average people, and fabulous wealth for the elites as well.
[00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:10.480]  Bringing back old-fashioned Americana, he sits there, worshipped by the foppish pseudo-intellectuals.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.021]  Leftist professor Noam Chomsky has
[00:22:14.471 --> 00:22:22.718]  Charged that it's possible President Trump will stage a terror attack in order to offset initial policy problems and quell opposition.
[00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:37.870]  Speaking with the left website Alternet, Chomsky, oh Chomsky, oh, who floats on his magic, suggested that Trump could organize a false flag incident to rally supporters who are discovering that his promises are built on sand.
[00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.511]  Oh yes.
[00:22:39.511 --> 00:22:43.534]  300 billion in new jobs, hundreds of major factories and companies coming back.
[00:22:44.417 --> 00:22:47.318]  Consumer confidence the best in 16 years.
[00:22:47.318 --> 00:22:49.839]  The best small business numbers since 1984.
[00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:51.179]  The last big recovery we really had.
[00:22:51.179 --> 00:22:52.019]  On and on and on and on.
[00:22:52.019 --> 00:22:54.980]  It would take too long to recite it all, wouldn't it?
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.621]  Renouncing we're secure, you know, border, nation, sovereign.
[00:22:58.621 --> 00:23:00.282]  Breaking the back of political correctness.
[00:23:00.282 --> 00:23:03.743]  Actually going after the jihadi armies, Obama and the globalists turned loose.
[00:23:04.778 --> 00:23:07.159]  Cleaning up what the globalists started.
[00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:09.521]  Just wars of defense.
[00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:16.565]  Trying to vet the Islamic hordes you're bringing in that have already come in and invaded Syria as the invasion point.
[00:23:16.565 --> 00:23:21.287]  As they did two times in the last century into Turkey and then trying to get into Europe.
[00:23:21.287 --> 00:23:22.368]  And you're the traitors.
[00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:23.529]  You know what you've done.
[00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:28.792]  You hate the West so much that there's been a bosom for you to grow like vipers.
[00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:44.550]  You want to conquer us so much like you want to conquer Russia with your filth and your degenerate collectivist slavery that you know is slavery, that you know puts you in charge over the people.
[00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.732]  I'd call him a neotrust guy.
[00:23:48.581 --> 00:24:12.720]  He says Trump with no evidence as Trump sits there and takes them all over the news saying kill him and COG, Democrats going around the Pentagon trying to organize a violent overthrow and he sits there and just takes it and takes it and takes it while he desperately tries to reverse all the tyranny and the shadow government and the deep state and floor seven openly in the WikiLeaks block him and try to cheat us and try to stop everything we're doing.
[00:24:13.871 --> 00:24:18.894]  And you just sit there going, oh, Noam Chomsky, oh, let me tell you how it is.
[00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:23.878]  Yes, he might do a false flag.
[00:24:23.878 --> 00:24:39.649]  When I came out and said our government at the highest levels worked with Saudi Arabia to take place on 9-11, to then attack countries that were actually westernized and not Wahhabis like Iraq, who we shut up, who was CIA run, followed his orders to invade Kuwait.
[00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:40.569]  That's fact.
[00:24:40.569 --> 00:24:41.270]  Actually classified.
[00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.977]  Oh, but he gassed the Kurds using CIA directives and weather reports.
[00:24:47.977 --> 00:24:50.941]  That's all been in the news.
[00:24:50.941 --> 00:24:53.384]  I get our military then allied with the Kurds, which is fine.
[00:24:53.384 --> 00:24:56.448]  I don't think they're bad people in the region, comparatively speaking.
[00:24:56.448 --> 00:24:59.532]  They're not really as radical, but the point is, is that the facts are facts.
[00:25:00.759 --> 00:25:03.442]  But oh, that's Noam Chomsky!
[00:25:03.442 --> 00:25:09.747]  He doesn't give you any facts like that, he just goes, oh, oh, oh my god, oh.
[00:25:09.747 --> 00:25:11.209]  Here, let me act like I'm Noam Chomsky.
[00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:14.772]  Let me read this article like I'm Noam Chomsky.
[00:25:14.772 --> 00:25:16.374]  Yes.
[00:25:16.374 --> 00:25:21.859]  Chomsky, well, Trump may stage false flag terror attack to rally support.
[00:25:21.859 --> 00:25:23.861]  Incident could be blamed on vulnerable people.
[00:25:25.447 --> 00:25:43.096]  Professor Omchomsky has charged that it's possible President Trump will stage a terror attack in order to offset initial policy problems and quell opposition.
[00:25:43.096 --> 00:25:45.357]  Oh my god!
[00:25:45.357 --> 00:25:48.218]  The big foundations that fund the university's funding.
[00:25:48.218 --> 00:25:49.719]  Oh he's so anti-establishment, I'm sorry.
[00:25:51.650 --> 00:26:03.309]  Speaking with left-leaning website Alternet, Chomsky suggested that Trump could organize a false flag incident to rally supporters who are discovering that his promises are built on sand.
[00:26:06.817 --> 00:26:12.019]  They're all hands on deck trying to plunge the stock market, bankrupt everything so they can finally get you under their dirty thumbs.
[00:26:12.019 --> 00:26:15.180]  Finally dictate the terms of your surrender, better clingers.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:21.583]  No matter what color you are, they want your guns and they want you on that gulag plantation learning to lick those boots.
[00:26:23.686 --> 00:26:26.407]  In order to maintain his popularity.
[00:26:26.407 --> 00:26:29.008]  Oh, but let's put some more fake polls out there.
[00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:35.369]  Hell, they got Hillary at like 78 in some polls on CNN on election day.
[00:26:35.369 --> 00:26:40.231]  Why not say Trump has a negative 200?
[00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:44.372]  Like, let's say the Democrats have an approval rating of 100 and Trump has a negative of 200.
[00:26:44.372 --> 00:26:46.433]  No one in America likes Trump.
[00:26:46.433 --> 00:26:47.833]  Not one person.
[00:26:47.833 --> 00:26:50.174]  CNN, that's your fake news.
[00:26:50.174 --> 00:26:51.134]  Why don't you just go that far?
[00:26:52.728 --> 00:26:57.055]  But see, he's actually being honest with everybody.
[00:26:57.055 --> 00:26:58.798]  Just like to their own troops.
[00:26:58.798 --> 00:27:02.945]  Moore was like, Trump's gonna win, watch, because they knew the real polls just like I did.
[00:27:02.945 --> 00:27:05.790]  They knew the big data mining information Google and others had.
[00:27:06.704 --> 00:27:11.988]  Bloomberg has, the high-level business folks, that billionaires like Trump get access to.
[00:27:11.988 --> 00:27:22.575]  Google only gives, and Bloomberg only gives super executive class access to stuff they've got that's better than the NSA, that the NSA's jacked into, to select global corporations.
[00:27:22.575 --> 00:27:30.440]  That's why everybody wants to kiss Global's butt is to get entree into that data swamp.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.181]  They see we're blind.
[00:27:32.181 --> 00:27:33.142]  We sleep, they live.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.382]  But don't you know there were people inside Bloomberg and other areas that were leaking intel to Trump?
[00:27:39.382 --> 00:27:49.027]  He knows other billionaires that aren't playing along with the New World Order, at least on their real actions, like Peter Thiel and others.
[00:27:49.027 --> 00:27:52.649]  But they all know this, so look, oh, a little Freudian slip here!
[00:27:52.649 --> 00:28:00.754]  In order to maintain his popularity, the Trump administration will have to try to find some means of rallying with support and changing the discourse
[00:28:01.854 --> 00:28:06.196]  From the policies they're carrying out, which are basically a wrecking ball to something else.
[00:28:06.196 --> 00:28:12.278]  Oh, a wrecking ball to the horrible globalist scumbag system we're in.
[00:28:12.278 --> 00:28:21.642]  The professor also hinted at such a staged terror attack could be blamed on vulnerable people, the poor little sweet Muslims that kill each other everywhere they live and won't let anybody else live in their country.
[00:28:21.642 --> 00:28:22.223]  He's like 99% Muslim.
[00:28:24.332 --> 00:28:38.557]  That's okay because they're vulnerable people and he represents compassion and love and good just like the Pope who won't let anybody into the Vatican that calls for Italy to bring on millions more quote refugees running around raping killing and going on welfare.
[00:28:38.557 --> 00:28:44.540]  Maybe scapegoats saying well I'm sorry I can't bring your jobs back which he's actually doing because these people are
[00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:46.440]  are preventing it.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.886]  And the typical scapegoats goes to vulnerable people, immigrants, terrorists.
[00:28:50.886 --> 00:28:51.927]  Scapegoats or terrorists?
[00:28:51.927 --> 00:28:52.848]  Oh, okay.
[00:28:52.848 --> 00:28:53.809]  Wow, I love this.
[00:28:53.809 --> 00:28:55.251]  Wow, the terrorists or scapegoats?
[00:28:55.251 --> 00:28:56.352]  Those poor little terrorists.
[00:28:56.352 --> 00:28:57.634]  He actually said that.
[00:28:57.634 --> 00:29:04.322]  The headline here ought to be Chomsky calls terrorists scapegoats and bills them as poor little victims.
[00:29:04.322 --> 00:29:05.283]  Muslims and elites.
[00:29:06.288 --> 00:29:08.950]  This is the best unintentional comedy when you're awake.
[00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.972]  See, they're like reading to a man in a trance.
[00:29:10.972 --> 00:29:17.577]  And then the sweet little terrorist Trump wants to... Little vampire perched by your bed.
[00:29:17.577 --> 00:29:20.019]  Ooh, I'm numb chompy, ooh!
[00:29:20.019 --> 00:29:23.402]  And one rolls out this liberal carpet and everyone just falls down.
[00:29:23.402 --> 00:29:24.203]  Oh, he's here!
[00:29:24.203 --> 00:29:26.925]  Oh my god, a five-year-old can write his books!
[00:29:26.925 --> 00:29:32.410]  Oh, he's so intellectual!
[00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:33.511]  Maybe scapegoats saying,
[00:29:34.912 --> 00:29:35.633]  Oh, maybe!
[00:29:35.633 --> 00:29:36.673]  Oh, maybe!
[00:29:36.673 --> 00:29:37.474]  Oh, maybe!
[00:29:37.474 --> 00:29:39.275]  Maybe pull a rabbit out of his rear end.
[00:29:39.275 --> 00:29:43.659]  Well, I'm sorry, I can't bring back your jobs because these bad people are preventing it.
[00:29:43.659 --> 00:29:47.682]  And the typical escape goes vulnerable people, immigrants, terrorists, Muslims, and elites.
[00:29:47.682 --> 00:29:49.263]  Oh, the elites!
[00:29:49.263 --> 00:29:51.485]  Oh, the poor, those little poor people!
[00:29:51.485 --> 00:29:54.267]  Noam Chomsky's defending the elites!
[00:29:54.267 --> 00:29:59.131]  It's everyone, the elites, the Muslims, everyone against the poor, mean Americans!
[00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:10.483]  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and New York City Council members have all fought back against Jeff Sessions' threat to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.
[00:30:10.483 --> 00:30:15.665]  This is an interesting choice to make, considering the very concept of sanctuary cities permits breaking the law.
[00:30:16.005 --> 00:30:20.589]  And all of the news stories surfacing daily regarding illegal immigrants committing violent crime.
[00:30:20.589 --> 00:30:22.190]  How about this from the Daily Caller?
[00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.853]  The same day these cities said they would remain sanctuary cities.
[00:30:25.853 --> 00:30:38.164]  Three Iraq refugees arrested in association with a terrorist, omitting information on refugee applications, lying about background information, and one is associated with a multiple hostage situation in an underground bunker.
[00:30:38.164 --> 00:30:40.486]  But in these cities, they would be welcome right back.
[00:30:40.666 --> 00:30:45.249]  This is an example of how partisan the anti-Trump extreme leftist liberals have become.
[00:30:45.249 --> 00:30:48.831]  They've abandoned all logic, common sense, and even the rule of law.
[00:30:48.831 --> 00:30:57.135]  If this is going on in a city near you, I would either get out or call your local leaders to let them know if they stand for this, they no longer have your vote.
[00:30:57.135 --> 00:30:59.537]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:31:00.097 --> 00:31:01.979]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:01.979 --> 00:31:04.020]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.923]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:06.923 --> 00:31:12.988]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.988 --> 00:31:22.195]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:31:22.195 --> 00:31:27.039]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:31:27.259 --> 00:31:29.701]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:37.726]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:37.726 --> 00:31:38.687]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.907 --> 00:31:43.291]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.291 --> 00:31:47.436]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:47.436 --> 00:31:54.145]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:58.250]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:00.532 --> 00:32:02.373]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:02.373 --> 00:32:08.955]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:08.955 --> 00:32:12.116]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:12.116 --> 00:32:21.900]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.760]  Caveman.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:27.822]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:27.822 --> 00:32:29.923]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:30.223 --> 00:32:33.385]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:38.509]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:46.675]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:46.675 --> 00:32:54.621]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:59.265]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and 4WarsLive.com today.
[00:33:07.802 --> 00:33:13.263]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[00:33:13.263 --> 00:33:17.444]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:33:17.444 --> 00:33:23.706]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:33:23.706 --> 00:33:29.067]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:33:29.067 --> 00:33:32.808]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:33:33.688 --> 00:33:36.211]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:33:36.211 --> 00:33:38.853]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:33:38.853 --> 00:33:43.698]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:33:43.698 --> 00:33:46.701]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:50.304]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[00:33:50.304 --> 00:33:51.926]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:33:54.568 --> 00:34:07.071]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:34:07.071 --> 00:34:09.052]  So enjoy the flavor!
[00:34:09.052 --> 00:34:13.693]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[00:34:13.693 --> 00:34:15.674]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:34:15.674 --> 00:34:17.534]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:34:17.534 --> 00:34:18.855]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:34:18.855 --> 00:34:20.455]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:34:20.755 --> 00:34:32.084]  ...is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:34:32.084 --> 00:34:36.467]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:34:36.467 --> 00:34:42.752]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:34:50.959 --> 00:34:53.581]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:34:53.581 --> 00:34:58.483]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:34:58.483 --> 00:35:00.985]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:35:00.985 --> 00:35:10.350]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.472]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:35:13.472 --> 00:35:15.693]  The scoops are on their way!
[00:35:15.693 --> 00:35:17.054]  The scoops are on their way!
[00:35:18.274 --> 00:35:20.755]  I repeat, the Scots are on their way!
[00:35:20.755 --> 00:35:24.676]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:35:24.676 --> 00:35:28.117]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:35:28.117 --> 00:35:29.858]  We gotta stop them!
[00:35:29.858 --> 00:35:33.199]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:35.239]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:43.022]  Next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle.
[00:35:43.022 --> 00:35:44.822]  For food.
[00:35:44.822 --> 00:35:46.503]  You gotta tell them.
[00:35:46.503 --> 00:35:47.023]  We're going to.
[00:35:51.564 --> 00:35:52.765]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:52.765 --> 00:35:56.007]  Let me finish up on Noam Chomsky.
[00:35:56.007 --> 00:36:01.290]  This has come out, Carol Quigley wrote an 1,100-page book for the State Department and the CIA.
[00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.592]  A thousand copies were published.
[00:36:05.592 --> 00:36:12.076]  Because it was government-funded, they couldn't block the republishing of it by groups affiliated with the John Burns Society in the 80s and 90s.
[00:36:12.076 --> 00:36:14.757]  We sell the book, by the way, in hardcover at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:36:14.757 --> 00:36:17.039]  That's a separate issue.
[00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:18.800]  And it was the head of the Georgetown Political Science
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:39.669]  and Bill and Hillary Clinton's mentor in the CIA but they explain how they would create and control these leftist professors who would then lead the opposition to globalism and then at a critical time they would support globalism.
[00:36:39.669 --> 00:36:42.531]  Now Noam Chomsky is the main guy.
[00:36:42.531 --> 00:36:49.034]  He's like the fake counterpart to the Brzezinski that's pushing the worldwide tyranny and then somebody like Chomsky
[00:36:50.589 --> 00:37:00.916]  You know, you read his books, and I didn't learn anything from him because I already knew it all from reading actual globalist books or just straight-up manuals on how they were doing it, but he would do it from kind of a leftist, communist perspective.
[00:37:00.916 --> 00:37:08.502]  But as the left hero, you know, battling the evil corporations.
[00:37:08.502 --> 00:37:17.828]  But then notice 1999 came, and they staged false flags there to blame the demonstrators, who were mainly liberals at the WTO in Seattle.
[00:37:17.828 --> 00:37:19.029]  Very legitimate group of people.
[00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:25.104]  And from that point on, all the professors flipped.
[00:37:25.104 --> 00:37:26.865]  They got their orders.
[00:37:26.865 --> 00:37:30.989]  And they flipped and became pro-globalist, pro-corporate world government.
[00:37:30.989 --> 00:37:40.738]  And to read him now saying Trump's going to stage terror attacks to blame on the Muslims and quote, the elites and other vulnerable groups.
[00:37:40.738 --> 00:37:46.243]  So now Chomsky's defending the precious elites and the Davos man and globalism.
[00:37:46.243 --> 00:37:47.264]  It has to be propped up.
[00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:47.985]  I mean, that's what
[00:37:49.229 --> 00:37:59.198]  Brzezinski said last week in a speech, that's what John McCain said last week, last Friday in a speech, they're hitting the panic button in every elite publication.
[00:37:59.198 --> 00:38:08.706]  Financial Times of London, Atlantic Monthly, Foreign Affairs, Public Affairs, The Washington Post.
[00:38:09.815 --> 00:38:15.921]  And when you read these papers, I read them every day, it's, yeah, we're getting ready to overthrow Trump and use COG to do it.
[00:38:15.921 --> 00:38:22.268]  We're going to suspend Congress for six months and we'll reorganize the country and we know best and we're getting the military ready.
[00:38:22.268 --> 00:38:24.189]  Atlantic Monthly, no big deal.
[00:38:24.189 --> 00:38:29.154]  Tom Chomsky thinks it's all wonderful.
[00:38:29.154 --> 00:38:30.536]  Oh, because Trump's the elite.
[00:38:31.761 --> 00:38:36.365]  And he's not delivering on his promises, so he needs to blow something up now.
[00:38:36.365 --> 00:38:39.587]  I mean, he's delivering on his promises.
[00:38:39.587 --> 00:38:41.989]  I can't believe he's getting anything done the way he's under attack.
[00:38:41.989 --> 00:38:49.856]  And the open mutiny going on, and then this guy can't admit that populism, classic Americana, free market, knocks the socks off.
[00:38:49.856 --> 00:38:59.484]  That produced Marilyn Monroe, the 57 Chevy, Saturn Rockets, Rock and Roll,
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.140]  The whole world's culture.
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.282]  Then globalists hijacked it and turned it into evil.
[00:39:07.282 --> 00:39:11.344]  But it was wild, wild, west, sexy.
[00:39:11.344 --> 00:39:15.807]  And it came in hundreds of flavors.
[00:39:15.807 --> 00:39:19.329]  And you could start out poor and become the richest man in America.
[00:39:19.329 --> 00:39:20.349]  You could be the president.
[00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:25.072]  You could be from some small guy in Fredericksburg, Texas and end up being the head of the U.S.
[00:39:25.072 --> 00:39:25.332]  Navy.
[00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.931]  But under their system now, that's not how it works.
[00:39:29.931 --> 00:39:31.412]  You've got to be part of the elite.
[00:39:31.412 --> 00:39:34.033]  This guy is such a fraud.
[00:39:34.033 --> 00:39:35.054]  He is such a fraud.
[00:39:35.054 --> 00:39:50.202]  And any real leftist out there... I remember when the left actually stood for some good things, but it was always controlled by the big foundations to keep the globalist enemy, which would just be kind of Americana, classical, Thomas Jefferson liberalism, on a very short lease.
[00:39:50.202 --> 00:39:51.643]  And that's just gone now.
[00:39:53.451 --> 00:39:57.734]  All the real liberals I know say, what happened to liberals when they start beating people up?
[00:39:57.734 --> 00:40:00.436]  It's when they got scared of what Trump's going to do.
[00:40:00.436 --> 00:40:06.861]  Because you believe TV shows that he's Hitler?
[00:40:06.861 --> 00:40:14.726]  And because at hundreds of universities people paint swastikas on the wall and knock over Jewish tombstones and in every case get caught and confess?
[00:40:14.726 --> 00:40:15.807]  It's so obvious!
[00:40:22.162 --> 00:40:27.866]  There reportedly have not been real cross burnings in this country that have been documented in over a decade.
[00:40:27.866 --> 00:40:37.712]  When my dad was a kid and his dad stood up against the KKK and stuff like that in East Texas and ran as a Republican and did things like that, my dad said, you overplay it like there were a bunch of threats and a big deal.
[00:40:37.712 --> 00:40:40.994]  They were hated and seen as toothless losers in the early 1960s, son.
[00:40:43.686 --> 00:40:55.635]  I mean, sure, every once in a while, you know, somebody says something rude to my family or we'd be in a grocery store or something and somebody would walk over and say something mean to my grandmother, but it was always trashy people.
[00:40:55.635 --> 00:40:57.956]  But, I mean, it's just, believe me, I know.
[00:40:57.956 --> 00:41:07.163]  I mean, the Klan was a joke, horrible thing to be associated with by the 1950s when Eisenhower and other people said, this is degenerate.
[00:41:08.942 --> 00:41:11.624]  And it had already become a gang, you know, since the Civil War.
[00:41:11.624 --> 00:41:14.107]  It was a paramilitary force at first during the occupation of the South.
[00:41:14.107 --> 00:41:16.108]  But that's all just history, folks.
[00:41:16.108 --> 00:41:18.030]  And they just don't think you know any of it.
[00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:25.457]  And they have these charlatans, like Noam Chomsky, who sits there like a garden gnome, like Yoda.
[00:41:25.457 --> 00:41:32.123]  And goes, and then he comes out and talks about elites.
[00:41:32.123 --> 00:41:33.164]  The poor elites.
[00:41:35.254 --> 00:41:46.197]  No one that knows history can argue with the fact that the left was anti-globalist, and so was the libertarian movement and the conservative arm of the public.
[00:41:46.197 --> 00:41:52.818]  Who wouldn't be against foreign TPP and IMF and World Bank and WTO, foreign secret groups running us?
[00:41:52.818 --> 00:42:00.060]  I don't care what color you are or where you came from, left, right, center, no one should be for that!
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:04.041]  That's why I was against it and made a film about it, The Takeover.
[00:42:05.759 --> 00:42:11.101]  But you read Chomsky's writings now, it is disgusting.
[00:42:11.101 --> 00:42:19.505]  He is for the most elite corporations and their consolidation of control, and the censorship you see happening, and all the rest of it.
[00:42:19.505 --> 00:42:24.187]  And you talk to his followers, they are the dumbest pseudo-intellectuals you've ever talked to.
[00:42:24.187 --> 00:42:26.248]  They don't know any facts, they don't know anything.
[00:42:26.248 --> 00:42:29.530]  And I don't try to say that to put them down to feel good, I feel bad.
[00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:39.583]  That there's just generations of people with worthless college degrees who just feel like Noam Chomsky's their god, and he's not, folks.
[00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:50.010]  Noam Chomsky, like the Pope, like the communist president in China, who's a dictator, like Ergun, all these people are dirtbags!
[00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.072]  And they all hate Donald John Trump.
[00:42:53.072 --> 00:42:56.194]  Because Donald Trump wants prosperity for everybody.
[00:42:59.212 --> 00:43:05.254]  Now I'm done on that because I've got a lot to cover here, but speaking of eugenics, we just played that Soylent Green intro.
[00:43:05.254 --> 00:43:07.955]  Michael Moore says Trump will cause human extinction.
[00:43:07.955 --> 00:43:19.598]  Liberal propagandist Michael Moore said Monday afternoon on Twitter that President Donald Trump will cause the extinction of human life on Earth.
[00:43:22.062 --> 00:43:32.892]  Now, if you actually get into what the leftists and the globalists are pushing, and you just heard statements from top leftists like Bill Maher, they want massive population reduction, they want less people.
[00:43:32.892 --> 00:43:38.917]  They don't realize massive populations built the cities, built the technologies, built the systems.
[00:43:38.917 --> 00:43:45.443]  But this cloistered, heavily armed hypocrite, with mansions all over the country, he
[00:43:49.031 --> 00:43:51.432]  Supports the whole abortion factory system.
[00:43:51.432 --> 00:43:57.615]  He supports the whole globalist program that he tells you Trump will extinct all life on Earth.
[00:43:57.615 --> 00:44:04.178]  Historians of the near future will mark today, March 28, 2017, as the day the extinction of human life on Earth begins.
[00:44:04.178 --> 00:44:05.218]  Thanks to Donald Trump.
[00:44:05.218 --> 00:44:09.820]  What?
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:14.082]  Meanwhile, HPV vaccine paralyzes 12-year-old aspiring pop star Daily Mail.
[00:44:14.082 --> 00:44:15.323]  And they admit it does it.
[00:44:15.323 --> 00:44:15.963]  It kills people.
[00:44:17.287 --> 00:44:25.170]  It's all part of the eugenics operation, but it's okay because AP reports felony charges for two secretly filmed Planned Parenthood in California.
[00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:34.294]  But if you're exposing crime and committing a crime to do it by the letter of the law, but only targeting the healthcare practitioners, you're covered.
[00:44:36.459 --> 00:44:39.681]  You're given immunity under common law, but see, they're all up there happy.
[00:44:39.681 --> 00:44:42.182]  See, the crime isn't keeping babies alive.
[00:44:42.182 --> 00:44:43.743]  The crime isn't harvesting their organs.
[00:44:43.743 --> 00:44:48.105]  The crime isn't telling people that you're selling their baby's parts and making sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:44:48.105 --> 00:44:51.226]  It looks like an eight-and-a-half-month-old baby.
[00:44:51.226 --> 00:44:51.626]  No, no, no.
[00:44:51.626 --> 00:44:53.127]  The crime is videotaping it.
[00:44:53.127 --> 00:44:57.369]  Now, those folks are heroes.
[00:44:57.369 --> 00:44:58.450]  Absolute heroes.
[00:44:58.450 --> 00:44:59.570]  And what's happening in the UK?
[00:45:01.374 --> 00:45:06.578]  They had the Lisbon Treaty a few decades ago and suddenly it was a treaty but the UK never voted.
[00:45:06.578 --> 00:45:14.884]  The people of England and Scotland and other areas of Wales never voted to enter the European Union.
[00:45:14.884 --> 00:45:16.886]  And now they make over 90% of their laws.
[00:45:16.886 --> 00:45:17.646]  That's admitted.
[00:45:17.646 --> 00:45:18.667]  That's not debatable.
[00:45:18.667 --> 00:45:20.669]  And the EU Parliament is elected.
[00:45:22.298 --> 00:45:28.902]  But it's ceremonial and advisory, is the term, to the Council that has immunity and is above the law.
[00:45:28.902 --> 00:45:30.723]  Oh, and I forgot the best part, tax exempt.
[00:45:30.723 --> 00:45:31.964]  Why not?
[00:45:31.964 --> 00:45:33.845]  It's now threatening an EU army takeover.
[00:45:33.845 --> 00:45:38.649]  They weren't ready to roll that out two years ago when we first started exposing it with Lord Monckton.
[00:45:38.649 --> 00:45:47.875]  So they said, oh, conspiracy theorists claim they've seen secret draft plans for an EU army to block countries, they now call them states, from leaving.
[00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:48.415]  But guess what?
[00:45:52.625 --> 00:45:55.306]  A few months ago they released the exact same draft and admit it's true.
[00:45:55.306 --> 00:45:58.007]  Just like we have a federal government, the Civil War wouldn't let us leave.
[00:45:58.007 --> 00:46:00.829]  They're now saying, but see, we voted to enter into this.
[00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:04.130]  We were at least part of it, had a revolutionary war together in a shared group.
[00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:12.874]  The French, the Germans, the Swedes, I mean these people are as different as night and day culturally.
[00:46:12.874 --> 00:46:13.694]  That's why they have countries.
[00:46:13.694 --> 00:46:16.776]  They didn't get along.
[00:46:16.776 --> 00:46:21.378]  The globalists want to force-flood Europe now with even more incompatible people, Islamists and others.
[00:46:22.927 --> 00:46:50.993]  And then referee the whole melee and a giant false flag that Noam Chomsky and others have been cheerleading of flooding us with totally incompatible dregs of the Islamic world who invaded Syria wanting some free land and got their asses kicked into Europe where they're now taken over there running around like mobs of psychotic leprosy covered vermin.
[00:46:50.993 --> 00:46:51.933]  Cultural leprosy.
[00:46:53.370 --> 00:47:01.456]  But the good news is they move forward, and it's popular in the UK, and the Prime Minister has now announced they're going forward with the pullout.
[00:47:01.456 --> 00:47:03.918]  Nigel Farage celebrates Article 50 Day.
[00:47:03.918 --> 00:47:06.260]  You've been triggered!
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:10.663]  And they laughed at him for decades in Parliament, and then in the EU Parliament, they're not laughing now.
[00:47:10.663 --> 00:47:11.884]  They also tried to kill him.
[00:47:11.884 --> 00:47:16.248]  The police said, no, they've tried to kill him repeatedly.
[00:47:16.248 --> 00:47:17.148]  Cut brake lines?
[00:47:17.148 --> 00:47:17.809]  You bet.
[00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:18.770]  Wheels off your vehicle?
[00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:19.190]  You bet.
[00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:20.071]  Crash your airplane?
[00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:20.431]  You bet.
[00:47:23.302 --> 00:47:25.285]  The pilot is pretty much a vegetable.
[00:47:25.285 --> 00:47:28.691]  Mirage climbed out, blood pouring out all over.
[00:47:28.691 --> 00:47:35.682]  What, seven broken bones?
[00:47:35.682 --> 00:47:37.285]  Live to fight another day.
[00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:51.035]  Meanwhile, look, sick ISIS militant made female prisoners torture each other for not wearing the veil.
[00:47:51.035 --> 00:48:08.633]  But that's okay, they've got UN programs running all over European TV, we played it, showing rock stars and movie stars, hot blondes, saying, I wear the hijab, and saying, you wear the hijab, telling German women, we've told our men not to be men, now learn to get cuckold.
[00:48:09.673 --> 00:48:11.922]  You don't want somebody who was sweet like your daddy.
[00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:12.926]  You, you know, no, no, no.
[00:48:12.926 --> 00:48:14.994]  You now get an Islamic man that, you know...
[00:48:15.885 --> 00:48:16.446]  You're going to learn.
[00:48:16.446 --> 00:48:18.648]  You're going to learn you good.
[00:48:18.648 --> 00:48:22.932]  Norway's Islamic Council hires a fully veiled woman as communications officer.
[00:48:22.932 --> 00:48:23.633]  But that's okay.
[00:48:23.633 --> 00:48:25.635]  If you criticize Islam, you get arrested.
[00:48:25.635 --> 00:48:26.796]  Because the left's allied.
[00:48:26.796 --> 00:48:27.657]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:48:27.657 --> 00:48:31.460]  Leftist flick-off memorial dedicated to victims of communism.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.081]  Daily Caller.
[00:48:32.081 --> 00:48:33.863]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:33.863 --> 00:48:40.209]  Most of the responses mock the idea that there should be a memorial for the many innocent people who died as a result of communist policies.
[00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:45.340]  Leftist staged a tiny protest at the Victims of Communism Memorial in Washington, D.C.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:51.341]  last weekend, where they all flicked off the monument designed to remember the millions murdered by the totalitarian ideology.
[00:48:51.341 --> 00:48:58.762]  Most of the responses on Twitter to those pictures mock the idea that there should be a memorial for the many innocent people who died as a result of communist policies.
[00:48:58.762 --> 00:49:09.284]  They've gone to universities, they've got worthless degrees, they literally believe living under some communist general like you do in China or North Korea or Venezuela collapsing is a great thing.
[00:49:11.158 --> 00:49:14.519]  So let's just remind them.
[00:49:14.519 --> 00:49:17.379]  Ladies, let's search engine mobile execution vans.
[00:49:17.379 --> 00:49:25.701]  They have a dozen of them per large city in China around the clock cutting the organs out when they take you out of the prison.
[00:49:25.701 --> 00:49:27.822]  It freaks people out when you do it at the prison.
[00:49:27.822 --> 00:49:33.683]  And then they put it on the airplane, they fly to Japan one hour away, and then Americans and others are there to get the fresh organs.
[00:49:33.683 --> 00:49:34.644]  A Buddhist!
[00:49:34.644 --> 00:49:37.384]  But you support peaceful Buddhists having their organs taken.
[00:49:37.384 --> 00:49:38.665]  I'm sure you do.
[00:49:38.665 --> 00:49:39.405]  Because they've got Mao,
[00:49:41.952 --> 00:49:46.475]  Salons and mall restaurants all over the United States.
[00:49:46.475 --> 00:49:47.415]  Everybody celebrates.
[00:49:47.415 --> 00:49:48.716]  It's so much fun.
[00:49:48.716 --> 00:49:49.597]  84 million under him.
[00:49:49.597 --> 00:49:50.657]  What about Stalin?
[00:49:50.657 --> 00:49:51.598]  20 million.
[00:49:51.598 --> 00:50:06.427]  It's so much fun to be associated with mass death and execution as you beg for the shield of our liberty and our republic to be pulled down so that you can get a bunch of free stuff as if you'll get anything, morons.
[00:50:09.517 --> 00:50:17.301]  Alright, we're gonna come back and get to the open borders and the situation with our sovereignty on that front and how it ties into a state rep caught tipping off illegals about ICE raids.
[00:50:17.301 --> 00:50:18.782]  We'll admit judges do it here in Travis County.
[00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:19.663]  It's like, you know...
[00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:29.090]  Old ladies, when the IRS is coming to take their house for back taxes, they don't get a warning from the judge.
[00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:40.736]  But see, it's just all this taking the hospitality of America and then turning it into a sick joke, like, I better give you everything in my house, my kids, my wife, everything, to my neighbor, and you're really going to respect me then.
[00:50:40.736 --> 00:50:42.957]  Well, most neighbors say, no way, dude, that's your life.
[00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:45.358]  But see, the left's been taught, yes, it's mine!
[00:50:45.358 --> 00:50:46.538]  It's mine!
[00:50:46.538 --> 00:50:47.379]  Give it to me right now!
[00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:49.631]  Ah, they're killing babies?
[00:50:49.631 --> 00:50:50.591]  I know lots of families.
[00:50:50.591 --> 00:50:51.952]  I can't even go to Whole Foods now.
[00:50:51.952 --> 00:51:00.415]  You go to Whole Foods in Austin, you got kids, people will walk over, laugh at you, they hate you, because they're so lonely, they're so unhappy, they're part of a death cult.
[00:51:00.415 --> 00:51:01.736]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[00:51:01.736 --> 00:51:04.997]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[00:51:04.997 --> 00:51:06.538]  The world is in turmoil.
[00:51:06.538 --> 00:51:11.060]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.181]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[00:51:14.181 --> 00:51:17.843]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[00:51:18.143 --> 00:51:22.566]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[00:51:22.566 --> 00:51:25.428]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[00:51:25.428 --> 00:51:29.131]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.

[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.523]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.

[00:54:07.124 --> 00:54:29.337]  You know, I was thinking about how Noam Chomsky operates.
[00:54:30.402 --> 00:54:35.746]  If you got a hook down in the water and it's got a worm on it, you know, it looks pretty tasty to the bass coming along or the perch.
[00:54:35.746 --> 00:54:36.467]  It's the same thing with them.
[00:54:36.467 --> 00:54:38.028]  That's why I can't stand these guys.
[00:54:38.028 --> 00:54:50.257]  I mean, again, I have the government documents how they hired the black preachers in the 20s to create the whole liberal movement so they could control black people and get them on welfare and destroy their families.
[00:54:50.257 --> 00:54:52.038]  And it took them 30, 40 years to get it going.
[00:54:52.038 --> 00:54:52.899]  And then look what they've done.
[00:54:52.899 --> 00:54:55.441]  I mean, Margaret Sanger's papers are public.
[00:54:55.441 --> 00:54:57.342]  There's films, there's books written on it.
[00:54:57.342 --> 00:54:58.603]  That's the same thing with Carol Quigley.
[00:54:59.574 --> 00:55:04.017]  I mean, I read stuff he wrote in the early 60s about the creation of people like Noam Chomsky.
[00:55:04.017 --> 00:55:06.618]  Word for word!
[00:55:06.618 --> 00:55:08.960]  Not my opinion!
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:13.783]  And that's why I get so upset.
[00:55:13.783 --> 00:55:14.923]  You should read Tragedy and Hope.
[00:55:14.923 --> 00:55:17.445]  It's the size of a Dallas phone book.
[00:55:17.445 --> 00:55:22.148]  Back when they had big phone books.
[00:55:22.148 --> 00:55:24.549]  It's like the size of a 1980s phone book in a big city.
[00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:26.110]  Go read it for yourself, and then you'll go.
[00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:28.632]  If you actually read the whole book, you'll see it and go, oh my God, this guy
[00:55:29.778 --> 00:55:32.040]  See, the State Department couldn't figure out how to run things.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.743]  They're like, we're communists, but we're not communists.
[00:55:34.743 --> 00:55:35.904]  We're fascists, but we're not.
[00:55:35.904 --> 00:55:36.945]  We want dictators.
[00:55:36.945 --> 00:55:38.147]  We don't want free countries.
[00:55:38.147 --> 00:55:39.708]  Both parties are going to be controlled.
[00:55:39.708 --> 00:55:43.232]  We're going to have a controlled left and right.
[00:55:43.232 --> 00:55:48.537]  And then so they wrote this book so a thousand people could understand it because they weren't Machiavelli.
[00:55:48.537 --> 00:55:50.379]  So, I mean, it's not my opinion about Chomsky.
[00:55:50.379 --> 00:55:53.142]  He is a horrible person, but I'm done ranting.
[00:55:54.343 --> 00:55:55.564]  But it's like a rape van.
[00:55:55.564 --> 00:55:59.005]  You know, it looks all nice and candy, puppy.
[00:55:59.005 --> 00:56:00.486]  That's how they act all liberal.
[00:56:00.486 --> 00:56:02.527]  Oh my gosh, communism's really good.
[00:56:02.527 --> 00:56:03.227]  You're gonna like it.
[00:56:03.227 --> 00:56:04.027]  Get in the car.
[00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:09.110]  They don't normally, you know, say rape van on the side.
[00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:10.910]  But if you're actually communist China, they do.
[00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:14.012]  They were gonna rape you of your life and cut your organs out and sell it.
[00:56:15.026 --> 00:56:16.728]  Now, before I go any further, I want to get to the border.
[00:56:16.728 --> 00:56:19.390]  We've got a bunch of guests coming up today and I need to tell you about that.
[00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:21.452]  I should plug twice an hour.
[00:56:21.452 --> 00:56:22.132]  I don't.
[00:56:22.132 --> 00:56:23.614]  We need to find our operation.
[00:56:23.614 --> 00:56:26.616]  The toothpaste will sell out today.
[00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:28.278]  The child's bubblegum flavor.
[00:56:28.278 --> 00:56:32.922]  It's all natural with iodine and colloidal silvers coming in next week.
[00:56:32.922 --> 00:56:36.685]  Now, we have 30% off the Biotrue Selenium by itself or with X2.
[00:56:36.685 --> 00:56:37.646]  Both of those are 30% off.
[00:56:39.065 --> 00:56:40.946]  And your purchase is absolutely essential.
[00:56:40.946 --> 00:56:42.047]  But let me tell you something.
[00:56:42.047 --> 00:56:46.431]  Just like our info is hardcore, game-changing, world-changing.
[00:56:46.431 --> 00:56:47.672]  We're public enemy number one.
[00:56:47.672 --> 00:56:48.953]  We have WikiLeaks documents.
[00:56:48.953 --> 00:56:50.774]  We have inside info.
[00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:54.036]  You know, from even Media Matters, where they hate me, they hate Roger Stone.
[00:56:54.036 --> 00:56:58.420]  They call us effective, dangerous, you know, Stone MVP.
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.282]  They're not attacking us because, you know, we're fun to make fun of.
[00:57:01.282 --> 00:57:04.084]  They're attacking us because we're radical Americans.
[00:57:04.084 --> 00:57:05.205]  They're radical globalists.
[00:57:05.205 --> 00:57:06.946]  We're radically challenging them.
[00:57:06.946 --> 00:57:07.407]  We don't just
[00:57:08.637 --> 00:57:10.263]  Eat around the edges.
[00:57:10.263 --> 00:57:13.657]  As Barry Goldwater said, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[00:57:14.628 --> 00:57:25.518]  So I'm telling you folks, you want to see us really get aggressive, you want to see us have reporters in the field seven days a week, 365 days a year, just investigating the pedophile rings, which I'm pledging to now do.
[00:57:25.518 --> 00:57:27.619]  We're going into high gear offense.

[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.921]  I think you can order a year out.
[00:57:43.921 --> 00:57:48.004]  We got more of the Victory 2, Lowers End, Limited Edition, Minuteman.
[00:57:48.004 --> 00:57:48.465]  We've got, uh...
[00:57:50.805 --> 00:57:52.786]  A new fire starter system that's so amazing.

[00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:03.530]  They want an info war!
[00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:04.791]  They want to win!
[00:58:04.791 --> 00:58:07.692]  They're saying I'm under investigation for being a communist or a Russian agent.
[00:58:07.692 --> 00:58:10.513]  They've got all these demonization campaigns going on everywhere 24-7.
[00:58:10.513 --> 00:58:16.076]  They've got TV shows and movies admitting it's characters based on me to say horrible things I never said.
[00:58:16.076 --> 00:58:18.477]  It's because we're effective and we're taking action.
[00:58:20.031 --> 00:58:25.073]  We have fire starter, fiber light, amazing, finely ground wood, fiber, and wax.
[00:58:25.073 --> 00:58:26.633]  At one spark, you get a fire.
[00:58:26.633 --> 00:58:27.814]  It's amazing.
[00:58:27.814 --> 00:58:32.796]  Check that out at InfoWarStore.com, again, or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:32.796 --> 00:58:35.597]  Whatever you do, spread the link, spread the videos.
[00:58:35.597 --> 00:58:38.117]  It's an InfoWar, and we're on the march.
[00:58:38.117 --> 00:58:42.419]  The globalist, corporate fraudster, Coney capitalists are on fire.
[00:58:42.419 --> 00:58:43.719]  They are burning down.
[00:58:43.719 --> 00:58:46.200]  Their control paradigm is exposed.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.721]  Once they're exposed, it's over!
[00:58:48.081 --> 00:58:49.982]  Hour number two, so rack it up!
[00:58:49.982 --> 00:58:50.702]  Let's get ready.
[00:58:50.702 --> 00:58:52.143]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:58:52.143 --> 00:58:53.443]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:58:53.443 --> 00:58:54.664]  Why is this so good?
[00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:59.946]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:58:59.946 --> 00:59:13.491]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:59:13.491 --> 00:59:14.852]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:59:15.632 --> 00:59:17.293]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:59:17.293 --> 00:59:19.855]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:59:19.855 --> 00:59:21.156]  These are all parasites.
[00:59:21.156 --> 00:59:22.257]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:59:22.257 --> 00:59:23.598]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:59:23.598 --> 00:59:24.879]  You have the neem in there.
[00:59:24.879 --> 00:59:28.102]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:59:28.102 --> 00:59:31.384]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:59:31.384 --> 00:59:34.446]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:59:34.446 --> 00:59:35.507]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:59:35.507 --> 00:59:36.328]  Living Defense.
[00:59:36.328 --> 00:59:37.429]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:37.429 --> 00:59:38.450]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:40.471]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:59:41.892 --> 00:59:43.094]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:06.232 --> 01:00:07.533]  Poets tell how poncho fell.
[01:00:07.533 --> 01:00:11.455]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:11.455 --> 01:00:13.276]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:17.798]  Love that Merle Haggard.
[01:00:17.798 --> 01:00:21.460]  Poets tell how poncho fell.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.322]  And left his living in a cheap hotel.
[01:00:24.322 --> 01:00:26.043]  The desert's quiet.
[01:00:26.043 --> 01:00:28.144]  Cleveland's cold.
[01:00:29.804 --> 01:00:38.591]  Save a few.
[01:00:38.591 --> 01:00:41.674]  Left it to... Alright.
[01:00:41.674 --> 01:00:46.037]  I want to get out on a boat somewhere and take my children fishing.
[01:00:46.037 --> 01:00:47.358]  Listen, put some Earl Haggard on.
[01:00:47.358 --> 01:00:51.501]  Earl Haggard, George Strait.
[01:00:51.501 --> 01:00:53.022]  Willie Nelson.
[01:00:53.022 --> 01:00:54.824]  Waylon Jennings.
[01:00:54.824 --> 01:00:56.805]  White Yoakam.
[01:00:56.805 --> 01:00:57.666]  Little Charlie Daniels.
[01:00:58.831 --> 01:01:10.535]  Little Hank Williams, Little Hank Williams Jr.
[01:01:10.535 --> 01:01:16.016]  43 years I've been alive, it's been one hell of an adventure so far.
[01:01:16.016 --> 01:01:20.918]  What an amazing world we live in, just filled with magic.
[01:01:20.918 --> 01:01:24.819]  And every major study shows that the so-called left
[01:01:26.235 --> 01:01:31.939]  Are empty, unhappy, suicidal people, and now they're becoming hateful?
[01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:36.101]  They are so mean.
[01:01:36.101 --> 01:01:43.346]  Millie Weir was talking about her with her child at Whole Foods this morning, and her cute little son, and he's a toddler.
[01:01:43.346 --> 01:01:47.609]  Now people come over and hiss at her, and are rude, and are mean, and will laugh at her.
[01:01:49.932 --> 01:01:50.092]  This is
[01:02:12.659 --> 01:02:18.503]  Creativity and just love and beauty and everything there is.
[01:02:18.503 --> 01:02:21.365]  And men being strong and honorable.
[01:02:21.365 --> 01:02:32.793]  It's a total assault on the species, scientifically, by the robber barons and the British royalty, starting in the 1850s in England, adopted here by 1900.
[01:02:32.793 --> 01:02:33.193]  All of it!
[01:02:33.193 --> 01:02:34.294]  The health department's everything.
[01:02:34.294 --> 01:02:37.476]  I'm not saying it's all bad, but it was set up to be bad.
[01:02:38.666 --> 01:02:42.010]  Humans are so good, we even take their evil agendas and some good comes out of it.
[01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:51.840]  But I've read, let's not exaggerate, 30 plus books on eugenics, written by the founders of it, the top people, Galton, you name it.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.223]  I mean, when I tell you this stuff, this is not my opinion.
[01:02:56.175 --> 01:02:59.417]  People are depressed, they're unhealthy, they're dying.
[01:02:59.417 --> 01:03:05.021]  And again, I'm not ever up here on some holy mountain like I'm Mr. Know-It-All, Mr. Beachbody.
[01:03:05.021 --> 01:03:06.442]  I just know what's happening to me.
[01:03:06.442 --> 01:03:08.323]  I know what Screen Time's doing.
[01:03:08.323 --> 01:03:12.966]  I know what bathing and all this electromagnetic radiation does to me, but I do it in a war.
[01:03:12.966 --> 01:03:16.969]  But notice Steve Jobs didn't let his kids play with a computer or an iPad.
[01:03:16.969 --> 01:03:18.069]  People don't believe that when I say it.
[01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:19.810]  I saw some articles saying I was a liar.
[01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:22.052]  He like gave interviews before he died saying that.
[01:03:23.336 --> 01:03:33.524]  There's literally tens of thousands of articles and studies saying screen time rewires your brain, brain damages you, does all this crap to you, unless you're consciously dealing with it.
[01:03:33.524 --> 01:03:49.836]  See, a book, as I've said, this is key to know, this is incontrovertible, a book, and that was a New York Times article where he said that, I should add, a book, let's click on it, it's linked to the Don's article for radio listeners, I want to show them the actual New York Times article, if you guys scroll down, there it is,
[01:03:51.135 --> 01:03:55.077]  A piece entitled, Steve Jobs was a low-tech parent.
[01:03:55.077 --> 01:03:56.918]  There you go.
[01:03:56.918 --> 01:03:59.419]  Oh, more fake news, more conspiracy theories.
[01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:08.724]  But getting back to what I was saying, you read a book, you have to visualize it.
[01:04:08.724 --> 01:04:14.727]  That's why I don't like pornography, because it just cheapens it and lowers libido, the studies show.
[01:04:14.727 --> 01:04:15.928]  But if you're, I'm not really into like,
[01:04:17.449 --> 01:04:28.722]  Sex novels or anything, but I've read in books, in literature, sexual passages that are so much more arousing in your heart, not in your groin.
[01:04:28.722 --> 01:04:31.205]  Because it's about passion and love.
[01:04:31.205 --> 01:04:33.428]  And see, they don't want you resonating with them.
[01:04:33.428 --> 01:04:37.112]  Or if you listen to radio, it shows IQs go up, you have to visualize it as well.
[01:04:39.764 --> 01:04:46.907]  I see TV, you go into that trance, and then they got you, then they can bring in those savage messages to assault you and your children.
[01:04:46.907 --> 01:04:56.731]  And we all just have to break with these people entirely, unless we watch them, to analyze them, and to show our children, like you in Africa say, that's a crocodile elite, you don't get close to it.
[01:04:56.731 --> 01:04:58.332]  You just show them the enemy and then that's it.
[01:05:00.458 --> 01:05:08.144]  While some liberal cities are fighting for the rights of law-breaking non-citizen migrants, others are cutting funds to schools that are too white.
[01:05:08.144 --> 01:05:14.168]  Walter Reed Middle School in North Hollywood is having funds cut because their school student body is too white.
[01:05:14.168 --> 01:05:17.390]  And this has led to layoffs and increased class sizes.
[01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:18.771]  Think schools have issues?
[01:05:18.771 --> 01:05:20.813]  Leave it to Democrats to make it worse.
[01:05:20.813 --> 01:05:22.494]  Think about this if the tables were turned.
[01:05:22.774 --> 01:05:29.778]  If Republicans were moving funds from schools because they were too black to schools that had a more diverse student body, there would be outrage.
[01:05:29.778 --> 01:05:30.838]  And rightfully so.
[01:05:30.838 --> 01:05:36.861]  But this is what Democrats are doing while shaming anyone who makes decisions or judgments based on someone's identity.
[01:05:36.861 --> 01:05:42.704]  The Democrats make policy based on identity while shaming people who make policy based on identity.
[01:05:42.704 --> 01:05:44.285]  What do you expect in California?
[01:05:44.465 --> 01:05:53.691]  Where they continue to elect people like Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, two mentally ill politicians that appear to have no clue what's even going on.
[01:05:53.691 --> 01:05:57.053]  America, let's stop electing morons.
[01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:59.914]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:03.336]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:03.336 --> 01:06:05.798]  They lost, we won.
[01:06:05.798 --> 01:06:08.159]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[01:06:08.159 --> 01:06:10.521]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:15.823]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:06:15.823 --> 01:06:21.544]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:27.806]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:06:27.806 --> 01:06:34.088]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:06:34.088 --> 01:06:36.529]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:06:36.809 --> 01:06:37.989]  We're the solution!
[01:06:37.989 --> 01:06:38.970]  Americans!
[01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:40.510]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:45.891]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:06:45.891 --> 01:06:47.552]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:06:47.552 --> 01:06:49.472]  DVDs now available.
[01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:52.913]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:06:52.913 --> 01:06:55.034]  Americans need to see this film.
[01:06:59.975 --> 01:07:08.242]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:07:08.242 --> 01:07:09.463]  A 360 win.
[01:07:09.463 --> 01:07:16.028]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:07:16.028 --> 01:07:23.554]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:07:23.954 --> 01:07:29.016]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:29.016 --> 01:07:35.119]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:42.923]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:42.923 --> 01:07:49.426]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:07:49.426 --> 01:07:50.927]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:07:51.087 --> 01:07:53.534]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:53.534 --> 01:07:55.519]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:07:55.519 --> 01:07:59.369]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:10.670]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:08:24.363 --> 01:08:34.087]  Alright, in mere moments we're going to Stefan Molyneux, popular TV slash radio host out of the great Canadian wilderness of liberal brainwashing.
[01:08:34.087 --> 01:08:36.688]  We're going to him here in just a moment.
[01:08:36.688 --> 01:08:38.389]  Brexit's moving forward in the UK.
[01:08:38.389 --> 01:08:41.050]  Globalism is in collapse all across the planet.
[01:08:42.304 --> 01:08:48.709]  Noam Chomsky says Trump may stage a false flag terror attack to rally support and target the vulnerable elite and other victims.
[01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:54.554]  Yes, Noam Chomsky is now calling the crony capitalists the scumbags of the planet that are allied with radical Islam.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:01.844]  The victims, the elite and Islam, are the poor little babies that are totally incompatible with themselves.
[01:09:01.844 --> 01:09:08.048]  Their countries are 99% Muslim for a reason, and the left, again, is totally doubled down on this.
[01:09:08.048 --> 01:09:09.569]  We'll talk to Stefan Molyneux about that.
[01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:10.350]  The Trump bump.
[01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:12.751]  Consumer confidence hits 16-year high.
[01:09:12.751 --> 01:09:16.134]  But, again, they're putting everything they can against Trump.
[01:09:16.134 --> 01:09:22.878]  Openly saying they want to drive down the stock market to teach him and us a lesson, just like they tried to drive down the British stock market.
[01:09:22.878 --> 01:09:25.000]  They're in London, in the city of London.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.101]  To teach them a lesson.
[01:09:27.101 --> 01:09:36.564]  The arrogance of, we're going to teach you a lesson by driving down your stock market and making sure you don't get jobs, and then turn around and go, Trump's failing, Trump's failing, Trump's failing.
[01:09:36.564 --> 01:09:38.044]  I'm surprised he's gotten anything done.
[01:09:38.044 --> 01:09:41.845]  This Open Rebellion, the articles on Infowars.com, we'll have stuff on about this.
[01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:51.709]  They have Atlantic Monthly with former top Obama officials saying, we're moving with COG to overthrow Trump, and that means physically, and have six months under executive orders.
[01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:52.169]  Go read it!
[01:09:56.135 --> 01:10:01.959]  To where they can suspend Congress and have new elections and they said, the whole Republican Party is infiltrated with Russians.
[01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:03.700]  We've got to get rid of all of them.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.241]  So what do you call it when you destroy an entire political party?
[01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:08.303]  Political genocide?
[01:10:08.303 --> 01:10:11.325]  Folks, by the way, I'm not embellishing this, okay?
[01:10:11.325 --> 01:10:17.088]  I'm an expert on COG just because I've watched the PBS documentaries and CNN used to report on it and I've read books on it.
[01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:19.890]  But this is if there's a nuclear war killing Congress and the President.
[01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:24.313]  This is the designates, they now have TV shows where designates take over, priming the public.
[01:10:25.131 --> 01:10:34.617]  Just like they have the new shows on HBO and on Showtime and CBS where Homeland and Alex Jones' character is really racist and puts out fake news and there's a woman president.
[01:10:34.617 --> 01:10:36.038]  They thought she'd be in.
[01:10:36.038 --> 01:10:38.059]  All the scripting is still lined up for that.
[01:10:38.059 --> 01:10:43.242]  Like the Chelsea book where she heads the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation worldwide for global government.
[01:10:45.094 --> 01:10:46.815]  So, there is quite a calamity going on.
[01:10:46.815 --> 01:10:49.956]  We'll also get into, did Obama's defense deputy just admit spying on Trump?
[01:10:49.956 --> 01:10:50.717]  That's Paul Watson.
[01:10:50.717 --> 01:10:52.098]  Yes, she says.
[01:10:52.098 --> 01:10:56.420]  We were spying, and he got all the intel he could to share it, but that was in the March 1st article.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:00.342]  Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence on Russian election hacking.
[01:11:00.342 --> 01:11:01.302]  New York Times.
[01:11:01.302 --> 01:11:05.244]  Matthew Rosenberg.
[01:11:05.244 --> 01:11:09.186]  And we have the January 20th, where Rosenberg said they were wiretapping Trump Tower.
[01:11:09.186 --> 01:11:09.806]  Remember?
[01:11:09.806 --> 01:11:11.227]  We have the communiques of Flynn!
[01:11:11.227 --> 01:11:11.968]  We have him!
[01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:14.289]  So I want to ask Stefan Molyneux, who's a smart guy,
[01:11:17.115 --> 01:11:19.637]  In many facets, are they winning?
[01:11:19.637 --> 01:11:20.617]  Are they losing?
[01:11:20.617 --> 01:11:21.798]  Is this total mental illness?
[01:11:21.798 --> 01:11:24.159]  Is there a method to their madness?
[01:11:24.159 --> 01:11:26.160]  Because we do not have memories of Goldfish.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:35.666]  I mean, some people do, but a large contingent have longer memories, and the real scientific polls coming out show Trump's like 65% right now, just like I told you during the election.
[01:11:36.633 --> 01:11:37.634]  They've got Gallup polls.
[01:11:37.634 --> 01:11:39.335]  One day is 36, one day is 55.
[01:11:39.335 --> 01:11:40.515]  It's all crap, folks.
[01:11:40.515 --> 01:11:41.356]  People on landlines.
[01:11:41.356 --> 01:11:42.877]  I won't get into polling technology.
[01:11:42.877 --> 01:11:47.159]  Everybody knows, just like jobless numbers or inflation numbers, it's fake.
[01:11:47.159 --> 01:11:48.800]  Trump comes out and says they're fake numbers.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.981]  Oh, no one ever said that.
[01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:51.601]  It's admitted fact.
[01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:52.902]  Every economist will tell you that.
[01:11:52.902 --> 01:11:58.245]  Just like he said, most of these cross burnings and church burnings and Jewish Center attacks are false flags.
[01:11:58.245 --> 01:11:59.706]  More like almost all of them.
[01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:01.107]  I can't remember one that was real.
[01:12:01.107 --> 01:12:04.369]  They just admitted the 19-year-old Jewish liberal was doing it.
[01:12:05.646 --> 01:12:08.448]  Running around, engaging in all these attacks.
[01:12:08.448 --> 01:12:09.549]  So where do we start?
[01:12:09.549 --> 01:12:11.871]  I mean, there's so much to go over here.
[01:12:11.871 --> 01:12:18.677]  I just don't know, just in a general atmosphere, of their incredible deception.
[01:12:18.677 --> 01:12:22.581]  Where Der Spiegel's here and says that I said, you want to suck my sausage.
[01:12:22.581 --> 01:12:23.962]  I didn't say that.
[01:12:23.962 --> 01:12:29.487]  I mean, it's like CBS anchor under fire for censoring Kennedy interview.
[01:12:29.487 --> 01:12:29.967]  This is what
[01:12:32.697 --> 01:12:38.960]  Oh, who was the female anchor that got sued because people recorded the anti-gun deal?
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:39.741]  Katie Couric.
[01:12:39.741 --> 01:12:40.961]  Katie Couric.
[01:12:40.961 --> 01:12:46.464]  And then they just released the hours, the actual focus group, where they'd say, well, why do you think guns aren't causing the crime?
[01:12:46.464 --> 01:12:49.105]  Well, people do it in areas that, you know, have gun control.
[01:12:49.105 --> 01:12:50.446]  They have higher gun laws.
[01:12:50.446 --> 01:12:58.110]  But she'd cut to them going, just waiting, because they'll roll tape and ask you to sit there like you don't know what you're doing, show you scratching your nose like you can't answer.
[01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:59.371]  Well, he did that to...
[01:13:01.598 --> 01:13:02.899]  Ted Koppel.
[01:13:02.899 --> 01:13:14.086]  So, again, I've gotten to the point where, no exaggeration, I now have people like BuzzFeed and the Rolling Stone and the New York Times and people chasing me down the street.
[01:13:14.086 --> 01:13:15.167]  They follow me around now.
[01:13:15.167 --> 01:13:23.252]  I mean, I'll be walking down the street and reporters run up demanding to talk to me and I just say, sorry, you're not real reporters, just make up whatever you want.
[01:13:23.252 --> 01:13:24.773]  I'm not going to sit for your interview
[01:13:26.144 --> 01:13:29.267]  So you can act like you did a real interview and pretend you're a journalist.
[01:13:29.267 --> 01:13:31.128]  I'm not going to do it unless it's live.
[01:13:31.128 --> 01:13:35.492]  Now leave me alone.
[01:13:35.492 --> 01:13:36.833]  But then they go further.
[01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:38.835]  They just want to shut down Media Matters.
[01:13:38.835 --> 01:13:45.040]  Remember the Democrats in Soros publicly wants to be completely banned off Google and banned off YouTube.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.261]  Banned off advertising.
[01:13:46.261 --> 01:13:48.363]  I mean they're calling for my annihilation.
[01:13:50.063 --> 01:13:52.467]  Torturous interference, classic.
[01:13:52.467 --> 01:13:55.812]  But they don't care because they got the big war chest and they're arrogant.
[01:13:55.812 --> 01:13:59.318]  But all over the world, people are turning against Soros, they're turning against Globalist.
[01:13:59.318 --> 01:14:01.041]  So, I've kind of set the table here.
[01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:04.346]  I have a lot to cover, but I also want to ask our friend,
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.761]  What areas he wants to get into.
[01:14:07.761 --> 01:14:10.243]  And then Roger Stone's coming up hosting the fourth hour.
[01:14:10.243 --> 01:14:13.805]  Stefan Molyneux, freedomainradio.com.
[01:14:13.805 --> 01:14:18.108]  Stefan Molyneux on Twitter, YouTube Freedom Radio as well.
[01:14:18.108 --> 01:14:18.889]  A lot going on.
[01:14:18.889 --> 01:14:19.949]  Thanks for joining us via Skype.
[01:14:19.949 --> 01:14:20.990]  I just threw a lot out there.
[01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:22.191]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:14:23.372 --> 01:14:27.435]  Oh, let's just talk about the incipient victory of reason and evidence, Alex.
[01:14:27.435 --> 01:14:28.996]  I am pumped, I am thrilled.
[01:14:28.996 --> 01:14:30.717]  Today it's Brexit day!
[01:14:30.717 --> 01:14:31.498]  Woohoo!
[01:14:31.498 --> 01:14:36.821]  Breaking free of the wrath that is going over the Niagara into collectivized statist nightmares.
[01:14:36.821 --> 01:14:40.323]  So, this I think is the beginning of the crack-up of the EU.
[01:14:40.323 --> 01:14:43.866]  I know there have been some setbacks, but I think it's beautiful.
[01:14:43.866 --> 01:14:50.270]  The fact that the EU, this great collective mess that was foisted on Europe against the will of the citizenry.
[01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:54.477]  They had to have referendum after referendum after vote until they got the one that they wanted.
[01:14:54.477 --> 01:15:04.234]  The fact that this experiment is cracking up in a similar time frame that the Soviet Union cracked up shows that there is still reason and sanity in human affairs and I'm very excited about what's coming up.
[01:15:05.123 --> 01:15:06.124]  I agree with you.
[01:15:06.124 --> 01:15:10.268]  I mean, clearly, even globalists admit the tide's going out, they're in crisis.
[01:15:10.268 --> 01:15:16.975]  Their answer is more wars and an alliance with Islam that can't even tie its shoelaces, and they're constantly killing each other.
[01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:21.660]  What the hell is the left with marches everywhere putting hajibs on women?
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:25.123]  I mean, I can't even make something up this absurd.
[01:15:25.123 --> 01:15:26.204]  Well, here's the thing, right?
[01:15:26.204 --> 01:15:28.927]  So, this collectivism that happened in Europe
[01:15:30.407 --> 01:15:33.408]  Now, the Democrats have a big problem in that they lost, right?
[01:15:33.408 --> 01:15:36.690]  They had a very experienced candidate running against a first-time newbie and they lost.
[01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:39.971]  So they have to come up with some reason that protects the elites as to why they lost.
[01:15:39.971 --> 01:15:42.592]  So now it's all Russia and all this kind of crap, right?
[01:15:42.592 --> 01:15:46.954]  It's the same thing when you had two giant world wars in Europe in the 20th century.
[01:15:46.954 --> 01:15:51.216]  Within the space of a couple of decades, the elites were facing rebellion within their own ranks.
[01:15:51.216 --> 01:15:58.018]  So they had to make up this story as to why we had all these terrible wars and 50 million people got killed and so on.
[01:15:58.018 --> 01:15:59.439]  And their answer was, ah,
[01:15:59.799 --> 01:16:02.301]  Alex, do you know what caused these wars?
[01:16:02.301 --> 01:16:03.081]  Borders!
[01:16:03.081 --> 01:16:04.001]  Yes, it's borders!
[01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:10.305]  So if we get rid of borders, it's not the elite, it's not the military-industrial complex and insurance hell isn't central banking, never wanna touch that.
[01:16:10.305 --> 01:16:11.446]  It's borders!
[01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:14.888]  Like, in other words, if your home gets robbed, the problem is your walls.
[01:16:14.888 --> 01:16:17.669]  So if we take down your walls, everything's gonna be fine.
[01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:19.610]  And so... And by the way, in Austin zoning?
[01:16:20.911 --> 01:16:26.376]  In Austin zoning, they are now under Gen 21, not allowing walls on new homes or apartments.
[01:16:26.376 --> 01:16:30.499]  No gates, no nothing, but the elites all live in the old part of the city and are building bigger walls.
[01:16:30.499 --> 01:16:32.080]  You cannot make this up.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:40.307]  And of course, since you mentioned the fact that absolutely globalism was the answer to these wars, that they admittedly stirred up to bring in the League of Nations and the UN.
[01:16:40.307 --> 01:16:45.952]  David Rockefeller, who just died last week, admitted in his memoirs, reflections and other books he wrote,
[01:16:46.252 --> 01:16:54.818]  That his family actually helped engineer this and they even helped fund Hitler and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute to control the full spectrum.
[01:16:54.818 --> 01:16:57.320]  I mean, talk about nastiness.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:02.084]  They don't want us to have nations so we can get together and resist their globalist operation.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:13.470]  Well, and people, of course, think that the EU was some spontaneous organization of the masses, like, oh, we're facing giant, consolidated totalitarianism behind the Soviet bloc and so on.
[01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:18.394]  So what we need is another giant layer of bureaucracy and central planning, because that's how you fight communism.
[01:17:18.394 --> 01:17:21.097]  It's the socialism I've never for the life of me understood.
[01:17:21.097 --> 01:17:24.680]  That logic, that's like fighting a headache by cutting your own head off.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.384]  But of course, it was the American elites who helped fund the origins.
[01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:29.245]  ...of the EU.
[01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.148]  It came out of precursors to the CIA.
[01:17:31.148 --> 01:17:34.372]  They never funded less than half of the groups that were advocating for it.
[01:17:34.372 --> 01:17:39.720]  It is a globalist, centralized, CIA-based, collectivist nightmare.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:43.466]  And finally, finally, Europe seems to be waking up from this nightmare.
[01:17:45.788 --> 01:17:48.849]  Stefan, it's dangerous to pause for me because I'll run over you.
[01:17:48.849 --> 01:17:51.050]  I'm giving you room to speak, Alex.
[01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:52.871]  I feel it's the only simple thing to do.
[01:17:52.871 --> 01:17:54.591]  What you're saying is not your opinion.
[01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:56.532]  I mean, you are literally stating reality.
[01:17:56.532 --> 01:18:00.854]  And I love how they keep saying, you know, the right wing is in its own bubble, the left wing is in its own bubble.
[01:18:00.854 --> 01:18:04.035]  I'm not right wing, but I didn't like Bush when he was doing it and they called me a leftist.
[01:18:04.455 --> 01:18:07.037]  I'm a nationalist, a common sense guy.
[01:18:07.037 --> 01:18:08.599]  I'm somebody that wants sovereignty.
[01:18:08.599 --> 01:18:10.561]  I want local government.
[01:18:10.561 --> 01:18:15.145]  America isn't perfect, but the Bill of Rights and Constitution is a hell of a lot better than what North Korea and Venezuela have.
[01:18:15.145 --> 01:18:16.266]  Look what's happening.
[01:18:16.266 --> 01:18:21.571]  So it's not that America ever even reached 10% of its potential, but it was going in the right direction.
[01:18:21.571 --> 01:18:23.012]  And so I agree with you.
[01:18:23.012 --> 01:18:24.293]  What's happening is prima facie.
[01:18:24.293 --> 01:18:28.357]  It's not like we're here just making up our own narrative and we're the fake news.
[01:18:28.757 --> 01:18:30.438]  They have brought in 5 million Muslims.
[01:18:30.438 --> 01:18:32.519]  80% of them are military-age men.
[01:18:32.519 --> 01:18:34.420]  They are running around like they own the place.
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:42.165]  The left is literally bringing them in like reinforcements, and Peter Sutherland of the EU and UN says they're trying to get rid of Europe because it has a middle class.
[01:18:42.165 --> 01:18:51.291]  I mean, what's weird is in their white papers they tell the truth, and it's so crazy and so bad that in public they lie, and I'm wondering why would the elite want to blow up
[01:18:52.171 --> 01:18:56.575]  The West that gives them this safety net for even elites.
[01:18:56.575 --> 01:18:59.837]  Why would they want to bring in authoritarianism when it's the most unstable system?
[01:18:59.837 --> 01:19:02.019]  What the hell are they doing?
[01:19:02.019 --> 01:19:06.743]  Well, people who are focused on political power are drug addicts, right?
[01:19:06.743 --> 01:19:18.593]  We know this from studies in monkeys, that as you rise through the hierarchy of the ranks, you get endorphins, you get all of these wonderful happy brain joy juices flooding through your system, and you become an addict.
[01:19:18.593 --> 01:19:19.834]  They literally are addicts.
[01:19:20.054 --> 01:19:21.715]  Of course, they're not playing with their own money.
[01:19:21.715 --> 01:19:25.878]  They're playing with our lives and the lives of our children and the security of our institutions.
[01:19:25.878 --> 01:19:36.965]  But it's no... You can't expect sense out of these people anymore that you can say, well, that gambling addict, why on earth would he end up losing his home, losing his house, losing his wife, lying face down in a ditch with a dead hooker?
[01:19:36.965 --> 01:19:38.686]  I mean, that's what addicts do.
[01:19:38.686 --> 01:19:41.968]  They continue to escalate until they're either cured or they crash.
[01:19:41.968 --> 01:19:44.350]  And I think we're kind of poised between the two at the moment.
[01:19:45.299 --> 01:19:45.799]  Exactly.
[01:19:45.799 --> 01:19:47.640]  So I see what you're saying.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:55.762]  Globalism, crony capitalism, on fire, the fake left backing globalism in trouble, the establishment right wing being voted out everywhere as well.
[01:19:55.762 --> 01:19:58.383]  I mean, I think Paul Ryan's probably worse than Pelosi because he's actually smart.
[01:19:58.383 --> 01:19:59.323]  And then I see Pelosi.
[01:19:59.323 --> 01:20:01.604]  We'll play the clip when we come back after the break in about 10 minutes.
[01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:06.685]  She literally, in multiple speeches, thinks Bush is still president.
[01:20:06.685 --> 01:20:09.946]  Maxine Waters thinks Russia invaded Korea.
[01:20:09.946 --> 01:20:11.546]  Doesn't even say North or South.
[01:20:11.546 --> 01:20:12.867]  But you can say, oh, we're cherry picking.
[01:20:12.867 --> 01:20:13.307]  No.
[01:20:13.307 --> 01:20:15.087]  That was in one press conference.
[01:20:15.087 --> 01:20:16.168]  We don't even play.
[01:20:16.168 --> 01:20:17.988]  They give me press conferences every couple days.
[01:20:17.988 --> 01:20:19.528]  That's even crazier.
[01:20:19.528 --> 01:20:22.129]  She literally has neurological disorders.
[01:20:22.129 --> 01:20:23.069]  I'm sad for her.
[01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:23.890]  She's clearly almost 80.
[01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:33.098]  You know, has a lot of facelifts and stuff, but the point is, she's got a rotten brain, and so does Maxine Waters, and they are in command.
[01:20:33.098 --> 01:20:38.584]  And I mean, it's, to me, that's what's horrifying, is these people are out of their minds.
[01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:45.611]  Well, there is a battle on, I would say, at big picture time, is the battle is between those who are competent and those who are incompetent, but greedy.
[01:20:46.317 --> 01:20:50.239]  Right, like, I'm incompetent in opera singing, so I don't try and dominate the stage of the Met.
[01:20:50.239 --> 01:20:51.700]  I mean, that's the way it works.
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:21:05.246]  So, incompetent people hate competition, which is why everyone's trying to shut down alternative media these days, because mainstream media is terrible, wretched, compromised, and lacks even the basic integrity that would allow a snail to stay inside its own home.
[01:21:05.246 --> 01:21:09.128]  And so, in Europe and in other places, they're trying to cut down competition between countries.
[01:21:09.128 --> 01:21:10.829]  Why is there so much centralization?
[01:21:11.449 --> 01:21:11.810]  I think?
[01:21:26.963 --> 01:21:28.104]  So let me ask you this.
[01:21:53.718 --> 01:22:00.806]  Again, great opportunity, global awakening happening, but like you said, they're incompetent but greedy.
[01:22:00.806 --> 01:22:02.228]  I don't understand it.
[01:22:02.228 --> 01:22:08.675]  I mean, the more, quote, power I get, the more concerned I am, the more careful I am, the more I watch what I say.
[01:22:08.675 --> 01:22:10.437]  When I say something wrong, I apologize for it.
[01:22:10.437 --> 01:22:13.180]  You know, I have children, I guess I'm getting older, but
[01:22:15.071 --> 01:22:20.852]  As I get more, quote, power, I feel more humble, and like a steward, thinking about the whole species.
[01:22:20.852 --> 01:22:22.833]  I don't say that to act goody-two-shoes, it's really true.
[01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:40.297]  Then I watch these people that claim they care about everybody, but as you know statistically, we're not left or right, but using that paradigm, leftists in Canadian studies, British studies, six, seven times more likely to steal, but many more times likely to virtue signal that they're actually giving and telling everyone how to act.
[01:22:40.297 --> 01:22:41.357]  And then I think back to when I was like 18,
[01:22:42.637 --> 01:22:43.979]  My mom threw me out of the house.
[01:22:43.979 --> 01:22:47.464]  I just graduated high school, and we'd moved houses.
[01:22:47.464 --> 01:22:52.071]  And, uh, you know, she bought some oriental rugs that today I think are awesome looking.
[01:22:52.071 --> 01:22:53.393]  And I was like, I don't like these.
[01:22:53.393 --> 01:22:54.414]  Why don't they that color?
[01:22:54.414 --> 01:22:55.696]  My mom looked at my dad.
[01:22:55.696 --> 01:22:57.298]  She goes, David, get him the hell out of here.
[01:22:57.779 --> 01:22:58.559]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[01:22:58.559 --> 01:22:59.880]  I mean, I think I can speak for both of us.
[01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:31.252]  Our power, as you call it, is not coercive.
[01:23:31.252 --> 01:23:32.213]  It's not political.
[01:23:32.213 --> 01:23:34.937]  We can't force anyone to do a damn thing.
[01:23:34.937 --> 01:23:36.159]  We can't force people to listen.
[01:23:36.159 --> 01:23:37.500]  We can't force people to support.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.682]  You can't force people to buy a car.
[01:23:38.682 --> 01:23:39.123]  I don't want them to.
[01:23:39.123 --> 01:23:41.326]  I mean, it's like wanting a woman to get in bed with you because she wants you.
[01:23:41.326 --> 01:23:42.007]  You don't want to rape her.
[01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:48.354]  So yeah, our authority is earned through slowly gathered credibility in the free market of ideas.
[01:23:48.354 --> 01:23:52.277]  And yes, we make mistakes, we have to backtrack, we're human beings, and that's natural.
[01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:56.401]  If we claim to never make mistakes, we would have as much credibility as the mainstream media.
[01:23:56.401 --> 01:24:02.706]  So your power, which is influence, is gained incrementally over the course of many years of interacting in the free market.
[01:24:03.146 --> 01:24:03.486]  Thank you.
[01:24:23.812 --> 01:24:47.468]  Wow, and again, this is not about Seth Mollen or Alex Jones, but you're a leading guy, reaching tens of millions a week, from millions a week, probably hundreds of millions a week soon, tending with Paul Watson, and I just get excited seeing you become even more popular, Paul, other people, but so many other talk shows I get around them, and they are just obsessed with it being them, them, them, even if they have a good message, they're blinded by the competition, not realizing the greater competition
[01:24:48.248 --> 01:24:51.249]  It's against the globalists and them wanting to end competition.
[01:24:51.249 --> 01:24:55.992]  So I get a thrill out of a guy that's got a super gorgeous wife or a really cool painting they've painted.
[01:24:55.992 --> 01:24:56.952]  I admire them.
[01:24:56.952 --> 01:24:59.473]  I don't get upset by their skill.
[01:24:59.473 --> 01:25:07.237]  And again, talking about us, talking about the different types that are out there, so that we can all psychoanalyze ourselves, but also what's happening in the world.
[01:25:07.237 --> 01:25:12.580]  Because I just don't understand people that want to pull everybody else down so they can be on top.
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:17.702]  Instead, why don't we lift everybody else up, but don't take something from me that you steal.
[01:25:17.702 --> 01:25:20.784]  Then they call that greediness, that I want to be independent and my own person.
[01:25:20.784 --> 01:25:25.106]  Like, I value my individualism so much that I guess it's a cult of individualism.
[01:25:25.106 --> 01:25:28.708]  And then I see con artists ripping people off and it pisses me off.
[01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:31.309]  So you're a smart guy when it comes to this.
[01:25:31.309 --> 01:25:32.850]  And I think we're similar in this.
[01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:34.071]  What do you call that then?
[01:25:34.071 --> 01:25:36.632]  And how do we get other people infected with that?
[01:25:38.251 --> 01:25:49.654]  You know, when I was in high school, I wrote a couple of plays and I was in a theater group and we did rehearsals and once we went to a friend of mine's place and man, his family was like loaded beyond anything you could conceive of.
[01:25:49.654 --> 01:25:51.955]  I mean, I've never seen that kind of wealth.
[01:25:51.955 --> 01:25:53.955]  I certainly hadn't before.
[01:25:53.955 --> 01:25:59.937]  And I was like, I was at his house looking around and I grew up, you know, very, very poor, a single mom household and all that kind of stuff.
[01:25:59.937 --> 01:26:01.397]  And I looked at all of that stuff.
[01:26:01.397 --> 01:26:04.298]  I tell you, Alex, I looked at that and I thought, you know,
[01:26:05.313 --> 01:26:07.476]  I'd like to get me some of that when I get older.
[01:26:07.476 --> 01:26:08.578]  This is really nice.
[01:26:08.578 --> 01:26:09.720]  I didn't feel resentful.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:10.961]  I felt enthusiastic.
[01:26:10.961 --> 01:26:11.863]  I felt empowered.
[01:26:11.863 --> 01:26:14.627]  I felt like, wow, this is what is available in life.
[01:26:14.627 --> 01:26:16.309]  Maybe I could go out and get me some.
[01:26:16.309 --> 01:26:20.155]  And then I became an entrepreneur in a software field, built a company, sold a company, and so on.
[01:26:21.036 --> 01:26:22.237]  And that, I think, is the difference.
[01:26:22.237 --> 01:26:33.582]  Whereas some people, I had another guy who came over, who basically was resentful and sour and saying everything negative about this guy's place, and he said, you know, the only reason this guy has stuff is that there's a hundred poorer people in the world.
[01:26:33.582 --> 01:26:34.843]  And I said, no!
[01:26:34.843 --> 01:26:36.243]  It's not a pie.
[01:26:36.243 --> 01:26:38.864]  It's not a pie like, I get more, you get less.
[01:26:38.864 --> 01:26:40.165]  It's growth.
[01:26:40.165 --> 01:26:42.946]  If I have a kid, it's not like I've stolen children from someone else.
[01:26:42.946 --> 01:26:45.407]  I've made that kid with my wife, myself.
[01:26:45.407 --> 01:26:48.069]  This made a new cool entity that can interface with their kids.
[01:26:48.909 --> 01:26:50.730]  You've made the world richer, and that's the thing.
[01:26:50.730 --> 01:27:05.216]  All the statistics, all the historians, all the economists admit, I mean, probably 99% of them are communists, that when you create incredible wealth that's not based on slavery but free market, it then builds the lowest base of the poor, go up even higher.
[01:27:05.216 --> 01:27:07.097]  No one can debate that!
[01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:13.540]  But again, we have the ultra-rich who are promoting anti-wealth because they don't want competition, and they even admit it.
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:14.560]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.281]  In fact, did you ever notice losers?
[01:27:16.761 --> 01:27:17.281]  We're good to go.
[01:27:43.192 --> 01:27:49.097]  That I saw losers were always attacking winners, just making crap up so they'd feel good.
[01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.178]  Well, but it's a great way of gaining strategies.
[01:27:51.178 --> 01:27:55.902]  Sorry, it's a great strategy for gaining resources if you don't want to go out and earn them yourself, right?
[01:27:55.902 --> 01:28:03.829]  So I had a comment on my YouTube channel the other day, because I've done a truth about sort of the Native Americans and the relationship that they had, the indigenous Americans with the Europeans and so on.
[01:28:03.829 --> 01:28:10.054]  And someone just posted underneath and they said, when will white people stop feeling guilty about things they weren't even alive for?
[01:28:10.774 --> 01:28:14.635]  And it's like, well, when we start paying for it, you know, because it's a great resource.
[01:28:14.635 --> 01:28:22.456]  If you can convince a rich person that he's rich because his family stole from you, then he may cough up resources through the state or through charity to give to you.
[01:28:22.456 --> 01:28:30.438]  It's a way of getting resources without actually having to go through the effort of earning them yourself by inflicting guilt and self-attack on other people.
[01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:36.219]  It's, you know, it's amoral at best, but it's a fairly decent strategy for just getting resources if you kind of suck in general.
[01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:37.919]  It is crazy.
[01:28:37.919 --> 01:28:42.223]  There's a lot of news topics to cover and I've already thrown a lot of points.
[01:28:42.223 --> 01:28:44.606]  When we come back though, Stefan, what do you want to hit first?
[01:28:46.332 --> 01:28:51.235]  Oh yeah, well let's talk about Michael Moore, let's talk about global warming, let's mix it all up with that kind of stuff.
[01:29:16.532 --> 01:29:20.433]  And, you know, that's like the coolest Indian, by the way, and, you know, all the other stuff.
[01:29:20.433 --> 01:29:21.373]  He's like, that's Native American!
[01:29:21.373 --> 01:29:22.054]  Native American!
[01:29:22.054 --> 01:29:23.574]  You know, whatever, I'll use the politically correct term.
[01:29:23.574 --> 01:29:24.394]  It doesn't matter.
[01:29:24.394 --> 01:29:26.135]  It's just that none of the real history is there.
[01:29:26.135 --> 01:29:32.316]  So let's briefly talk about that some after we get into Michael Moore and so much more, and talk about how will the globalists strike back, though?
[01:29:32.316 --> 01:29:34.397]  Because they're not going to give up.
[01:29:34.397 --> 01:29:36.658]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side.
[01:29:36.658 --> 01:29:38.838]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:29:38.838 --> 01:29:39.478]  Spread that link.
[01:29:39.478 --> 01:29:42.899]  If you want to see the truth about Native Americans, go see the movie The Revenant.
[01:29:42.899 --> 01:29:44.100]  That's very, very accurate.
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:44.500]  We'll be back.
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:44.800]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.362 --> 01:29:53.285]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.285 --> 01:30:00.551]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.551 --> 01:30:16.743]  Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas has caused controversy after she appeared on MSNBC and said the Obama administration spied on Donald Trump in order to gather intelligence for political purposes.
[01:30:16.923 --> 01:30:20.705]  Get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration.
[01:30:20.705 --> 01:30:34.752]  Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staff dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence.
[01:30:34.752 --> 01:30:40.335]  Then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill.
[01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:41.736]  Well, it appears Ms.
[01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:54.848]  Farkas was so caught up in the discussion that she didn't even realize the significant admissions she was making about Obama spying on Trump's team and releasing classified intelligence to the public.
[01:30:54.848 --> 01:30:56.229]  That's why you have the leaking.

[01:31:59.793 --> 01:32:06.338]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:32:06.338 --> 01:32:09.561]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:32:09.561 --> 01:32:15.146]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:32:15.146 --> 01:32:21.271]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:32:21.271 --> 01:32:24.554]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:24.554 --> 01:32:25.995]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:32:26.195 --> 01:32:30.497]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:32:30.497 --> 01:32:33.438]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:32:33.438 --> 01:32:35.119]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:32:35.119 --> 01:32:38.560]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.161]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:32:41.161 --> 01:32:42.222]  It's in powder form.
[01:32:42.222 --> 01:32:45.083]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:45.803]  I take this.
[01:32:45.803 --> 01:32:47.624]  This is the product that I take.
[01:32:47.624 --> 01:32:49.585]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:32:50.405 --> 01:32:51.205]  We fight the Globals!
[01:32:51.205 --> 01:32:52.346]  We fight the New World Order!

[01:32:58.429 --> 01:33:16.717]  This is a island that at its widest level is what 12 miles from shore to shore and at its smallest level or smallest
[01:33:20.111 --> 01:33:28.798]  Location, it's seven miles between one shore and the other.
[01:33:28.798 --> 01:33:31.340]  Is that correct?
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:37.344]  I don't have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.
[01:33:37.344 --> 01:33:47.752]  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over
[01:33:55.697 --> 01:33:59.459]  I stand here as a free slave.
[01:33:59.459 --> 01:34:11.326]  We've seen nothing that we can work, that I can work with President Bush on and I'm disappointed because I thought that there might be some interest because of what he said in the campaign.
[01:34:11.326 --> 01:34:13.487]  What are we going to do?
[01:34:13.487 --> 01:34:15.709]  How can a president
[01:34:16.749 --> 01:34:29.099]  Who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin.
[01:34:29.099 --> 01:34:35.984]  And knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC.
[01:34:35.984 --> 01:34:44.611]  And knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families.
[01:34:47.475 --> 01:34:48.818]  What is Aleppo?
[01:34:48.818 --> 01:34:49.740]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.585]  You are correct.
[01:34:59.255 --> 01:35:10.381]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea?
[01:35:10.381 --> 01:35:17.465]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[01:35:17.465 --> 01:35:19.206]  Stop it.
[01:35:19.206 --> 01:35:22.667]  We're going back to Stefan Molyneux of freedomandradio.com here in just a moment.
[01:35:22.667 --> 01:35:23.568]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:35:25.489 --> 01:35:27.550]  Do I have to tell you they're attacking us?
[01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:30.832]  They take anything I do and they twist it.
[01:35:30.832 --> 01:35:32.313]  They edit what I say.
[01:35:32.313 --> 01:35:33.954]  I'm not anti-gay.
[01:35:33.954 --> 01:35:37.396]  They cut it and say I'm anti-gay on Colbert.
[01:35:37.396 --> 01:35:39.298]  I mean it's just unbelievable.
[01:35:39.298 --> 01:35:40.698]  That's because we're so effective.
[01:35:40.698 --> 01:35:42.399]  I'm proud of that.
[01:35:42.399 --> 01:35:43.960]  Now they're also trying to intimidate everybody else.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:46.202]  Like if you criticize us we're going to come after you.
[01:35:46.202 --> 01:35:46.542]  Good!
[01:35:46.542 --> 01:35:47.443]  You're so discredited.
[01:35:48.274 --> 01:35:52.298]  You've got the dumbest people who still believe you at 60 minutes and all the rest of it.
[01:35:52.298 --> 01:35:56.762]  Go ahead and make up whatever steaming piles of baloney you want to.
[01:35:56.762 --> 01:35:57.723]  I'm not worried about it.
[01:35:57.723 --> 01:36:01.146]  I'm looking for thinking people of every race, color, and creed.
[01:36:01.146 --> 01:36:06.572]  It's so frustrating though to see those that follow the brainwashing and all the editing and the rest of the crap.
[01:36:07.898 --> 01:36:08.839]  They're pushing their censorship.
[01:36:08.839 --> 01:36:12.223]  I'm going to ask Stefan in a minute where he thinks that's going, but we shall.
[01:36:12.223 --> 01:36:22.794]  I go out and research the very best gravity-fed filters, Pro-Pure, Alexa-Pure, the very best out there that, you know, have the 9-9-9-9 this and 100% that, hundreds and hundreds of chemicals in the food and water.
[01:36:24.059 --> 01:36:28.701]  The biggest thing you do for yourself and your family is the water you cook with and everything else you should put through a gravity-fed filter.
[01:36:28.701 --> 01:36:34.443]  Reverse osmosis is good as well, but it cuts out the good minerals, so that's a backup.
[01:36:34.443 --> 01:36:35.583]  I have that too.
[01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:44.166]  But you can find a whole bunch of different, really great systems, the lowest prices out there, and support the broadcast and free speech and what we're doing at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:44.166 --> 01:36:46.146]  The network funds itself with ads, and I don't
[01:36:50.748 --> 01:36:59.475]  I don't fund myself with advertisers because they get targeted by the Democratic Party and the media and the corporations and the banks.
[01:36:59.475 --> 01:37:04.119]  They just openly racketeer together and say, just shut him down or we're going to shut you down.
[01:37:04.119 --> 01:37:06.160]  We're going to take your banking license.
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:08.402]  We're going to come after your newspaper.
[01:37:08.402 --> 01:37:11.525]  We're not going to let you promote what you're doing because it's popular.
[01:37:12.344 --> 01:37:13.685]  It's good.
[01:37:13.685 --> 01:37:14.906]  So we have a super combo.
[01:37:14.906 --> 01:37:19.849]  Get Survival Shield, the good halogen, X2, Nation Iodine, and Biotruselenium.
[01:37:19.849 --> 01:37:25.212]  We got the very strongest mustard seed, organic, certified, best lab in the country.
[01:37:25.212 --> 01:37:28.014]  It's like $10 less than crap stuff they sell at Whole Foods.
[01:37:28.014 --> 01:37:30.155]  I mean, it's just so good.
[01:37:30.155 --> 01:37:31.416]  Super combo.
[01:37:31.416 --> 01:37:33.737]  So get those two things go together.
[01:37:33.737 --> 01:37:36.459]  Now here's the deal.
[01:37:36.459 --> 01:37:38.320]  Talk to your doctor about this because
[01:37:39.972 --> 01:37:46.855]  Selenium is so powerful that it will get you souped up, but you can't take too much selenium.
[01:37:46.855 --> 01:37:59.101]  When it comes to X-Tube, if you've been deficient in the good halogen and everything else, your thyroid stuff's full of bad halogens like fluoride and bromine, bromide, that's what it'll absorb.
[01:37:59.101 --> 01:37:59.982]  There could be some fireworks.
[01:38:01.291 --> 01:38:09.940]  And this is one of the only things when it talks about iodine that the CDC admits they'll have way lower IQs, deformities, you name it, in utero if you don't have enough iodine.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:11.842]  You've got to have selenium, you've got to have iodine.
[01:38:11.842 --> 01:38:16.347]  But if you've not had it, you've been deficient a while, it's like, just get ready.
[01:38:16.347 --> 01:38:19.771]  Because, I mean, Mother Nature's got some compounds that'll blow you away.
[01:38:21.027 --> 01:38:23.428]  Almost all the stuff you get at stores is synthetic.
[01:38:23.428 --> 01:38:25.088]  It's got to be organic.
[01:38:25.088 --> 01:38:27.569]  It's got to be bio-identical for you to absorb it.
[01:38:27.569 --> 01:38:29.430]  I've read like the medical stuff about growth hormone.
[01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:31.530]  You get synthetic growth hormone, you don't absorb it.
[01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:33.051]  You got to get the real stuff.
[01:38:33.051 --> 01:38:34.371]  And it's the same thing with all this.
[01:38:34.371 --> 01:38:38.132]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:38:38.132 --> 01:38:44.974]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site for amazing survival goods, camping goods, preparedness goods.

[01:38:51.275 --> 01:38:54.818]  Also, we've got Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver.
[01:38:54.818 --> 01:38:55.399]  Amazing.
[01:38:55.399 --> 01:38:57.200]  Everybody knows about Colloidal Silver.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.102]  Made by the biggest lab in the country.
[01:38:59.102 --> 01:39:01.204]  They're the folks, you know, private label for Whole Foods.
[01:39:01.204 --> 01:39:02.085]  Ours is $5 less.
[01:39:02.085 --> 01:39:03.926]  Just pointing that out.
[01:39:03.926 --> 01:39:04.987]  Very same stuff.
[01:39:04.987 --> 01:39:05.588]  Same factory.
[01:39:05.588 --> 01:39:06.469]  Top factory in the country.
[01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:08.111]  Thank you.
[01:39:24.901 --> 01:39:26.703]  Let's just start here with the censorship.
[01:39:26.703 --> 01:39:27.383]  I know you're confident.
[01:39:27.383 --> 01:39:27.923]  It's not an act.
[01:39:27.923 --> 01:39:28.324]  We are winning.
[01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:47.586]  They're saying, use the Federal Elections Commission to sue Drudge and shut him down.
[01:39:47.586 --> 01:39:51.309]  As if our speech that say pro-gun is then political speech, so it's regulated.
[01:39:51.309 --> 01:39:53.090]  You can't regulate free speech.
[01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:56.033]  They just call it political, and then claim jurisdiction.
[01:39:56.033 --> 01:39:57.494]  They're saying, shut me down.
[01:39:57.494 --> 01:39:58.714]  They kicked us off AdRoll.
[01:39:58.714 --> 01:40:00.656]  Now they want Google to kick us off the Google Ads.
[01:40:00.656 --> 01:40:05.760]  This is official Democratic Party, George Soros groups, saying and lobbying, they admit they're lobbying,
[01:40:07.341 --> 01:40:09.622]  The listeners need to understand, this isn't a game.
[01:40:09.622 --> 01:40:12.123]  Churchill, you know, like you said, they're losing the intellectual battle.
[01:40:12.123 --> 01:40:17.345]  That's why, as cornered rats, they're so dangerous.
[01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:25.589]  Well, there's an old saying that Churchill had in 1941 and 1942, when England began to, or the Allies began to have some successes against Nazi Germany.
[01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:27.390]  People are like, oh, the end is in sight.
[01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:29.031]  And he says, nope, nope.
[01:40:29.031 --> 01:40:31.532]  This is not the end.
[01:40:31.532 --> 01:40:32.953]  It is not even the beginning of the end.
[01:40:32.953 --> 01:40:34.674]  It may, however, be the end of the beginning.
[01:40:35.394 --> 01:40:39.116]  And it's the old saying goes, they only shoot at you when you're over the target, right?
[01:40:39.116 --> 01:40:41.437]  You're dumping bombs in the ocean, they don't care.
[01:40:41.437 --> 01:40:42.957]  But if you're over the target, they care.
[01:40:42.957 --> 01:40:46.159]  So the degree of opposition is the degree of our success.
[01:40:46.159 --> 01:40:48.780]  And it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:41:00.485]  The left is fully aware of the role that alternative media has played in fighting collectivism, in bringing Donald Trump into the White House, in Brexit and the upcoming elections in France and other places.
[01:41:01.245 --> 01:41:06.949]  They know and they understand how much power we have, how much influence we have, and how much better we are.
[01:41:06.949 --> 01:41:10.131]  Because you don't try and censor people that you're better than.
[01:41:10.131 --> 01:41:17.196]  Like, it's the runner who's really fast who's going to beat you in the race that you may want to, you know, plant something in his bag so he looks bad or something.
[01:41:17.196 --> 01:41:19.217]  If you're confident you can win, you don't bother with this stuff.
[01:41:19.217 --> 01:41:20.718]  So they don't think they can win and they're right.
[01:41:21.278 --> 01:41:31.846]  So they're going to use all of these kinds of tricks and tools, but I think we can get the information out in a powerful and compelling and wide-reaching enough way to illuminate them for who they are and what they're doing.
[01:41:31.846 --> 01:41:33.207]  They're not friends of freedom.
[01:41:33.207 --> 01:41:34.448]  They're not friends of the future.
[01:41:34.448 --> 01:41:35.809]  They're not friends of free speech.
[01:41:35.809 --> 01:41:41.773]  They're not friends of truth and reason and evidence of all the accumulated glories of Western civilization.
[01:41:41.773 --> 01:41:50.019]  They are trying to drag the West back down into a very dark, very nasty medieval collectivist hole, and we have to fight like hell
[01:41:50.459 --> 01:41:58.766]  To keep from dragging down there because once we get down there with the surveillance technology that we have now, it's hard to see how we could ever get back out.
[01:41:58.766 --> 01:41:59.487]  Beautifully said!
[01:42:01.673 --> 01:42:09.597]  Looking at this, our biggest enemies ourselves, if they finally capitulate and start to collapse, they've already admitted economic terror they're trying.
[01:42:09.597 --> 01:42:12.758]  I think that's their greatest weakness, that they admit with Brexit and the U.S.
[01:42:12.758 --> 01:42:18.741]  they're using economic warfare to try to hurt the economy, to make us not like Trump or nationalism.
[01:42:18.741 --> 01:42:26.945]  It's just, you know, they've gone from this whole invincibility with MSM saying they didn't exist, to now admitting world government's falling apart and that it's unelected.
[01:42:26.945 --> 01:42:28.646]  I just don't see how they ever thought
[01:42:29.486 --> 01:42:46.749]  It was going to go on, or how Zuckerberg, who thinks he's going to transcend and become some god, or Ray Kurzweil, how these guys, it's like they thought they could take hundreds of acres of people's land in Kauai, that was native land and just owned by people, surrounding his 700 acres, he wanted more.
[01:42:46.749 --> 01:42:50.350]  So Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb Fs, just thought he'd take it.
[01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:51.250]  He finally had to back off.
[01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:58.892]  It's like, don't they understand that at the end of the day, when they try to dumb us down, it only blows back on them?
[01:43:00.396 --> 01:43:05.779]  Well, it's a truism from history that those from the old world never see the new world until it's too late.
[01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:08.361]  And that's why we have to double down more than ever.
[01:43:08.361 --> 01:43:11.943]  Commit to reaching more people, to be more engaging, to be more entertaining.
[01:43:11.943 --> 01:43:14.004]  For me, sometimes, just to be more goofy.
[01:43:14.004 --> 01:43:15.465]  I'll sing to you in Japanese.
[01:43:15.465 --> 01:43:23.330]  Whatever it takes to entertain people and keep them engaged in the conversation is what we need to do because it is civilization hanging in the balance.
[01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:24.410]  We win now.
[01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:25.471]  I think we win forever.
[01:43:25.931 --> 01:43:28.252]  We lose now, I think we lose forever.
[01:43:28.252 --> 01:43:36.175]  The stakes to me are that high and I am incredibly honored and pleased to be part of this movement to bring truth, reason, freedom, and evidence to the world.
[01:43:36.175 --> 01:43:36.455]  I agree.
[01:43:36.455 --> 01:43:38.676]  We are definitely at the crossroads of the species.
[01:43:40.171 --> 01:43:49.397]  Yes, and the lies are all falling apart, like Michael Moore is screaming about... Well, to me it's kind of ironic that Michael Moore is screaming about excessive energy consumption.
[01:43:49.397 --> 01:43:55.741]  I'd like to see that man attack a ballet... Sorry, attack a buffet, like a great white and a herd of dolphins.
[01:43:55.741 --> 01:43:58.203]  But there's this... Lies all coming apart.
[01:43:58.203 --> 01:44:01.485]  They say, oh, we're really terrified about what the temperature might be in a hundred years.
[01:44:02.205 --> 01:44:03.306]  But what about the national debt?
[01:44:03.306 --> 01:44:07.548]  What about the close to 200 trillion dollars America has in unfunded liabilities?
[01:44:07.548 --> 01:44:10.870]  A massive multi-million dollar nuisance chain around the unborn.
[01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:11.991]  Do they not care about that?
[01:44:11.991 --> 01:44:12.991]  No, they don't care about that.
[01:44:12.991 --> 01:44:16.753]  They care about whether it's one or two degrees higher in a hundred years.
[01:44:16.753 --> 01:44:20.315]  Oh, it's just them scripting themselves as a savior.
[01:44:20.315 --> 01:44:25.858]  I mean, they even admit in their own internal documents it's all a fraud to take control of all energy, then pick winners and losers.
[01:44:25.858 --> 01:44:30.161]  It's the ultimate, wicked, villainous energy control plan.
[01:44:31.294 --> 01:44:39.142]  Well, and this is what Trump has done that I hugely admire, is Keystone Pipeline and loosening restrictions on coal.
[01:44:39.142 --> 01:44:41.784]  Look, a civilization requires energy consumption.
[01:44:41.784 --> 01:44:43.686]  That's just the basic reality of it.
[01:44:43.686 --> 01:44:55.538]  We're either going to get our energy domestically in North America, or we're going to ship billions and billions and hundreds of billions of dollars over to China, to theocratic dictatorships that have been implicated in directly funding terrorism around the world.
[01:44:56.038 --> 01:44:57.619]  Oh, that's not a nice question!
[01:44:57.619 --> 01:45:04.584]  ...and have jobs ourselves and have incomes ourselves, or we shovel untold amounts of money to theocratic dictatorships who wish us harm.
[01:45:04.584 --> 01:45:06.025]  There's no third option.
[01:45:06.025 --> 01:45:17.854]  And the fact that Middle Eastern countries have been shown to be funding certain environmental groups is because they want to put the big green barrier up to energy independence in the West so they can continue to get our money so they can fund groups to attack us.
[01:45:17.854 --> 01:45:25.179]  And that, to me, it's almost treasonous to freedom to have nothing but opposition to energy independence from the Middle East.
[01:45:25.279 --> 01:45:30.378]  And I feel very strongly about that because I can see the pictures of the people who die from these kinds of attacks.
[01:45:31.192 --> 01:45:32.792]  What do you make of Washington D.C.
[01:45:32.792 --> 01:45:49.977]  put a little humble memorial, it ought to be bigger than the Washington Monument, for those that died at the hands of communism, the biggest mass murdering regime in history, conservatively 150 million people, last century alone, Venezuela collapsing, everything else, and then a bunch of trendies came out and flipped it off, saying there's no such thing as victims of communism.
[01:45:49.977 --> 01:45:51.278]  What the hell?
[01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:53.518]  What about 60 million Chinese farmers?
[01:45:53.518 --> 01:45:56.039]  What about another 20 million killed by the Chai Koms?
[01:45:56.039 --> 01:45:58.800]  Innocent people, collectivized and murdered,
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.103]  And David Rockefeller wrote New York Times articles praising it.
[01:46:02.103 --> 01:46:11.152]  Now these, these people, these scumbags, I mean they live in the lap of freedom, bitching and saying we want North Korea.
[01:46:11.152 --> 01:46:12.433]  I mean these people are sick.
[01:46:12.433 --> 01:46:12.974]  What do you make of that?
[01:46:14.295 --> 01:46:16.536]  I think it's pure sadism.
[01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:22.620]  It is pure, horrifying human joy in the destruction of other people's aspirations and hopes and freedoms.
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:36.568]  I don't know what kind of toxicity in childhood or in the womb or what happens to people that turn them that rancid in their souls, but there have been studies where they show people horrifying injuries, you know, nails being put through people's hands in simulated ways and so on.
[01:46:36.568 --> 01:46:38.670]  And there's a certain small section of the population, Alex?
[01:46:39.210 --> 01:46:40.931]  Their happy centers light up.
[01:46:40.931 --> 01:46:43.093]  Their little brain orgasm centers light up.
[01:46:43.093 --> 01:46:46.515]  That's what makes them happy, is crushing hopes, crushing aspirations.
[01:46:46.515 --> 01:46:52.499]  And of course, those who want to commission future crimes must bury the bodies of past crimes so nobody can see what they have in store.
[01:46:52.499 --> 01:46:58.402]  If everyone knew where communism led to, which is a higher death count by far, by far, than Nazism.
[01:46:58.402 --> 01:47:02.625]  It is the most destructive and toxic ideology the world has ever seen that's not theological.
[01:47:02.705 --> 01:47:04.266]  Conservative over 150 million.
[01:47:04.266 --> 01:47:05.466]  Let's expand.
[01:47:05.466 --> 01:47:12.248]  Countries that actually were through hardcore communism, even the communists in China, apologize for Mao and his wife and say he went too far.
[01:47:12.248 --> 01:47:16.910]  The Soviets had big debates and apologized for Lenin and Stalin.
[01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:23.192]  They say, no, it's perfect, it's wonderful, and F, victims of communism.
[01:47:23.192 --> 01:47:27.314]  Most of them poor farmers didn't even know what it was.
[01:47:27.314 --> 01:47:28.654]  Just look at these people.
[01:47:28.654 --> 01:47:29.915]  They are such enemies.
[01:47:30.748 --> 01:47:33.509]  Well, this is how you know that there's no such thing as zombies, Alex.
[01:47:33.509 --> 01:47:45.556]  Because if there were, every time one of these douchebags opened their mouths, there would be millions of post-Soviet death zombies arising back up from the Holodomor in Ukraine, and there would be millions of them just trying to...
[01:47:45.936 --> 01:47:49.277]  Find and eat their brains and coming up completely empty-handed.
[01:47:49.277 --> 01:47:51.758]  It is an unbelievably vicious and evil ideology.
[01:47:51.758 --> 01:47:58.281]  And the fact that there are out-and-out communists teaching all over the place in universities and think tanks and so on.
[01:47:58.281 --> 01:48:00.241]  I was taught by a particular Marxist professor.
[01:48:00.241 --> 01:48:01.822]  He wore a little badge of Marx.
[01:48:01.822 --> 01:48:08.565]  You can't conceivably be a Nazi out there teaching National Socialist ideology, but you can be a communist, which has a higher death count.
[01:48:08.565 --> 01:48:10.025]  And that is the challenge.
[01:48:10.025 --> 01:48:11.606]  That is all the stuff being exposed.
[01:48:11.606 --> 01:48:14.427]  Not because of the crimes against us, but the crimes being planned to come.
[01:48:15.087 --> 01:48:15.528]  Exactly.
[01:48:15.528 --> 01:48:27.966]  Big universities funded by big foundations, the money of the robber barons, creating communism, and these sick little mental patient professors that couldn't build a barn, or run a sandwich shop, or wipe their own asses.
[01:48:27.966 --> 01:48:30.350]  And I'm not a violent guy, and I'm not calling for violence.
[01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:33.511]  But I see them saying, kill Trump, overthrow, murder.
[01:48:33.511 --> 01:48:38.473]  We got that article on Infowars.com where the deep state is openly saying we're preparing to overthrow Trump.
[01:48:38.473 --> 01:48:39.994]  We're going to go after opposition.
[01:48:39.994 --> 01:48:42.955]  And it's all these little wimps fantasizing about violence.
[01:48:42.955 --> 01:48:47.076]  I mean, imagine those little wimps there desecrating that memorial to the dead.
[01:48:47.076 --> 01:48:49.717]  If people actually showed up and said, just with bare fists, let's go.
[01:48:49.717 --> 01:48:51.838]  Oh, they'd call it hate crimes everywhere.
[01:48:51.838 --> 01:48:58.901]  They want to push ideologies that murder people en masse, but they're going to scream bloody murder if people start kicking their asses.
[01:48:59.201 --> 01:49:04.503]  And I'm sorry, at a fundamental level, I see them as rat-like enemies, and just my heart starts beating.
[01:49:05.546 --> 01:49:09.128]  They are pencil-necked Iagos to the Othello of the state, right?
[01:49:09.128 --> 01:49:13.129]  So what they want to do is they want to put out all their poison in their blogs and their articles.
[01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:14.410]  They want to put all this poison out.
[01:49:14.410 --> 01:49:15.070]  Trump is Hitler.
[01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:16.731]  It's the end of the world if we know it.
[01:49:16.731 --> 01:49:21.533]  He's bringing about the extinction of the human race by allowing people to burn coal instead of buying coal.
[01:49:21.533 --> 01:49:22.074]  Run for the hills!
[01:49:22.074 --> 01:49:23.594]  We're all dead!
[01:49:23.594 --> 01:49:29.697]  Yeah, and so what happens is then they get people so inflamed that other people act out their homicidal fantasies.
[01:49:29.697 --> 01:49:31.538]  And then the memorial to dead people!
[01:49:31.538 --> 01:49:33.679]  Some guy convinces a boyfriend to go beat him up.
[01:49:33.979 --> 01:49:35.460]  And then a memorial to dead people!
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:36.721]  You gotta go piss on it!
[01:49:36.721 --> 01:49:38.563]  That's the thing about the communists locally.
[01:49:38.563 --> 01:49:40.724]  They go attack the Blue Cat Cafe.
[01:49:40.724 --> 01:49:42.186]  It was an empty lot.
[01:49:42.186 --> 01:49:43.066]  It's a cat sanctuary.
[01:49:43.066 --> 01:49:44.988]  It's become popular in East Austin.
[01:49:44.988 --> 01:49:46.369]  And it's owned by these total liberals.
[01:49:46.369 --> 01:49:47.950]  I've actually been there before.
[01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:49.471]  I don't want to give a little story.
[01:49:49.471 --> 01:49:50.212]  We're going to adopt a cat.
[01:49:50.212 --> 01:49:51.293]  We got one somewhere else.
[01:49:51.293 --> 01:49:52.333]  And we're sitting there.
[01:49:52.333 --> 01:49:55.776]  The communists put glue in the keyhole so you can't feed the cats.
[01:49:55.776 --> 01:49:56.637]  Knock the windows out.
[01:49:56.637 --> 01:49:57.417]  Attack it.
[01:49:57.417 --> 01:49:59.919]  And it's like, be as nasty as they can.
[01:50:00.819 --> 01:50:02.247]  Be as nasty as they can.
[01:50:02.247 --> 01:50:03.634]  It's like, what cult are they from?
[01:50:05.256 --> 01:50:09.637]  Well, if a commie wants to get close to a pussy, all he has to do is look in the mirror.
[01:50:09.637 --> 01:50:10.838]  As far as I'm concerned.
[01:50:10.838 --> 01:50:11.498]  I hear you, man.
[01:50:11.498 --> 01:50:13.118]  It is a cowardly and brutal ideology.
[01:50:13.118 --> 01:50:15.879]  If you want to go steal from someone, I completely disagree with it.
[01:50:15.879 --> 01:50:16.339]  It's immoral.
[01:50:16.339 --> 01:50:20.661]  But if you want to go steal with someone from someone and you don't want the risk of a physical confrontation, right?
[01:50:20.661 --> 01:50:24.462]  You don't want to be a mugger because a mugger might have someone fight back pretty strenuously.
[01:50:24.462 --> 01:50:30.524]  Well, then you go to the states and you whisper that all these people are out there who've become rich because they've stolen from the poor and they've stolen from you.
[01:50:30.524 --> 01:50:34.325]  So now, please, Mr. Government, get all of the armaments and the coaches and the equipment and the
[01:50:34.845 --> 01:50:39.110]  As the target, the Blue Cat Cafe, a cat sanctuary.
[01:50:39.110 --> 01:50:43.174]  It's like they picked the most evil thing they could, just the most pathetic.
[01:50:43.174 --> 01:50:45.696]  Why the hell would you do that?
[01:50:45.696 --> 01:50:53.264]  Because again, they see women running a cat sanctuary as wimps and they're little pieces of crap.
[01:50:53.264 --> 01:50:55.065]  Oh my gosh, we'll be right back.
[01:50:55.065 --> 01:50:55.706]  Stay with us.
[01:50:55.706 --> 01:50:58.329]  I mean, it's just unbelievable at the scum level.
[01:51:00.843 --> 01:51:02.544]  Hi there, Dick Allgaier here.
[01:51:02.544 --> 01:51:06.925]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[01:51:06.925 --> 01:51:10.386]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[01:51:10.386 --> 01:51:13.067]  I am very skeptical of health supplements.
[01:51:13.067 --> 01:51:21.529]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One, so I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[01:51:21.889 --> 01:51:24.890]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters.
[01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:30.653]  Those little energy drinks that have caffeine and guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[01:51:30.653 --> 01:51:31.773]  This is not that.
[01:51:31.773 --> 01:51:35.034]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[01:51:35.034 --> 01:51:36.275]  My mood is better.
[01:51:36.275 --> 01:51:37.475]  My joints feel better.
[01:51:37.475 --> 01:51:42.217]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[01:51:42.217 --> 01:51:45.839]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more.
[01:51:45.839 --> 01:51:47.840]  So I recommend Synergy One.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:48.920]  It's really good stuff.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:50.701]  I'm having great results with it.
[01:51:51.331 --> 01:51:56.513]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:51:56.513 --> 01:51:59.455]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:51:59.455 --> 01:52:00.555]  Think about this.
[01:52:00.555 --> 01:52:13.121]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[01:52:13.121 --> 01:52:17.143]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[01:52:17.383 --> 01:52:21.228]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey Water Filter.
[01:52:21.228 --> 01:52:32.101]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[01:52:50.795 --> 01:52:51.675]  For the love of clean water.
[01:52:59.687 --> 01:53:00.508]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:53:00.508 --> 01:53:02.309]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:53:02.309 --> 01:53:03.950]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:06.773]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:53:06.773 --> 01:53:09.074]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:53:09.074 --> 01:53:13.578]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:53:13.578 --> 01:53:17.521]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:53:17.521 --> 01:53:21.304]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:53:21.304 --> 01:53:21.624]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:53:21.624 --> 01:53:23.045]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:53:29.008 --> 01:53:31.569]  We use cell phones against our heads every day.
[01:53:31.569 --> 01:53:32.969]  But now a landmark U.S.
[01:53:32.969 --> 01:53:38.590]  government study confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[01:53:38.590 --> 01:53:40.651]  The time to protect yourself is now.
[01:53:40.651 --> 01:53:42.491]  The solution is DefenderShield.

[01:54:29.268 --> 01:54:32.310]  And we are back live here with Stefan Molyneux, my guest.
[01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:34.833]  Look, again, I'll say this a thousand times.
[01:54:34.833 --> 01:54:36.514]  I'm not up here claiming I'm perfect.
[01:54:36.514 --> 01:54:43.961]  Well, I talk about things I do myself, but you look at the fact that people don't exercise, they don't go outside, kids don't play outside anymore.
[01:54:43.961 --> 01:54:48.305]  All you see is the glowing color of blue TVs at night.
[01:54:49.352 --> 01:54:51.794]  There is a breakdown of society.
[01:54:51.794 --> 01:54:58.818]  And then a lot of people don't feel fulfilled because they didn't go through rites of passage, they're not doing normal human biological activities.
[01:54:58.818 --> 01:55:05.023]  And then you read the elites saying they've designed it all to hijack our modern society to be as destructive as possible.
[01:55:05.703 --> 01:55:14.651]  And then again, I use the Omega Man or the Last Man on Earth analogy of, there's the last guy who isn't a zombie, but some of the zombies still have their intellects.
[01:55:14.651 --> 01:55:17.713]  And he's like, listen, I have the cure, it's my antibodies, my blood, you can be human again.
[01:55:17.713 --> 01:55:20.936]  They go, dude, we don't want to be human again, and they kill him.
[01:55:20.936 --> 01:55:23.958]  Or you can, you know, remake the Will Smith, I Am Legend.
[01:55:25.246 --> 01:55:28.169]  And I'm not on some high horse like I'm some great guy.
[01:55:28.169 --> 01:55:29.570]  I see the statistics.
[01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:30.451]  I see the numbers.
[01:55:30.451 --> 01:55:31.773]  I see how pissed they are.
[01:55:31.773 --> 01:55:38.459]  I see how the left and the establishment right have become just a disease of arrogance.
[01:55:38.459 --> 01:55:40.441]  And you can see the arrogance they all have.
[01:55:40.441 --> 01:55:41.902]  It's like it's their possession.
[01:55:42.643 --> 01:55:50.467]  And then they want to dominate us with this twisted will, and then they're totally incompetent, and collapse every country they're in control of.
[01:55:50.467 --> 01:55:54.909]  So, the big question is, how far does this process go, and what happens?
[01:55:54.909 --> 01:56:00.132]  Because I asked earlier, and we didn't get to it, do they ever capitulate, and then what comes after that, Stefan Molyneux?
[01:56:01.576 --> 01:56:06.558]  Well, I guess like dealing with any addicts, there are some who will get better and some who won't.
[01:56:06.558 --> 01:56:12.921]  And we reach with as much information those who've been indoctrinated, like we were talking about communism and so on.
[01:56:12.921 --> 01:56:23.466]  A third of millennials believe that President George W. Bush was responsible for more deaths than Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who killed millions, you know, just in the forced
[01:56:23.806 --> 01:56:26.028]  How can you know communism isn't a total nightmare?
[01:56:26.028 --> 01:56:27.129]  It's always a horrible nightmare.
[01:56:54.009 --> 01:56:56.531]  They're always saying, Cuba's so good, Venezuela's so good.
[01:56:56.531 --> 01:56:57.992]  I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?
[01:56:57.992 --> 01:57:00.134]  Canadian healthcare is so good, they're all coming down here.
[01:57:00.134 --> 01:57:01.095]  Not that ours is that good.
[01:57:01.095 --> 01:57:03.337]  I mean, it's just, they're not informed.
[01:57:03.337 --> 01:57:08.581]  They're little kids in arrested development, and the whole system is about arresting that development.
[01:57:08.581 --> 01:57:09.842]  So how do we get them out of that?
[01:57:10.905 --> 01:57:16.931]  I think, you know, I hate to say, if I had some big plan other than what I've been doing for the last 30 years, I would be doing that big plan.
[01:57:16.931 --> 01:57:18.853]  I think just, I mean, we have this incredible medium.
[01:57:18.853 --> 01:57:21.456]  You and I are having this conversation thousands of miles apart.
[01:57:21.456 --> 01:57:23.458]  It's going to reach millions and millions of people.
[01:57:23.458 --> 01:57:24.159]  They can share it.
[01:57:24.159 --> 01:57:25.980]  You know, everybody has their part to play.
[01:57:26.761 --> 01:57:31.162]  People may not have your energy, your charisma, your enthusiasm.
[01:57:31.162 --> 01:57:35.244]  They may not have my particular abilities and education, but everyone has a part to play.
[01:57:35.244 --> 01:57:44.366]  Everything you share, every little shred of information that you bring up, every video you share, every tiny brave post you make on social media, you don't know who that's going to wake up.
[01:57:44.366 --> 01:57:47.667]  It could be somebody with infinite... By the way, we're not being patronizing.
[01:57:47.667 --> 01:57:49.488]  The power literally lies with the people.
[01:57:50.487 --> 01:57:55.751]  There are folks who are more articulate than us that just need to start their own shows and do it as a duty and not be scared.
[01:57:55.751 --> 01:57:57.292]  You should be scared of not doing it.
[01:57:57.292 --> 01:58:02.176]  By the way, what do you make of Noam Chomsky saying he thinks Trump will stage a false flag to bring in Muslims?
[01:58:02.176 --> 01:58:05.618]  Isn't bringing in radical Muslims by the millions, isn't that the false flag?
[01:58:05.618 --> 01:58:08.821]  Because they're going to blow stuff up, then you take our rights when they attack.
[01:58:10.717 --> 01:58:13.640]  Well, I think everyone knows that there are going to be more attacks.
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:19.227]  I mean, don't you every morning just sort of look there and say, woohoo, no attacks today, yay, that's a good day.
[01:58:19.227 --> 01:58:21.870]  And so everyone knows there's going to be more attacks and there's going to be an escalation.
[01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:30.980]  And in particular, if Marine Le Pen gets in and begins to start to unravel some of the accommodations that have been made to the immigrant population, particularly the third world,
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:33.283]  Let's talk about that, because we're already being held hostage.
[01:58:33.283 --> 01:58:36.607]  Her gun says, do what I say, or I'll blow it, burn up Europe.
[01:58:36.607 --> 01:58:37.668]  We gotta call the bluff!
[01:58:37.668 --> 01:58:39.971]  I mean, you know, you can't pay the pirate over and over again.
[01:58:39.971 --> 01:58:42.754]  Well, Stephon Molyneux will talk about paying the pirate.
[01:58:42.754 --> 01:58:44.256]  Doesn't work, doesn't turn out well.
[01:58:44.256 --> 01:58:44.677]  We'll be back.
[01:58:44.677 --> 01:58:45.017]  Stay with us.
[01:58:50.805 --> 01:58:52.385]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.385 --> 01:58:58.287]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:58:58.287 --> 01:59:00.828]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:59:00.828 --> 01:59:06.629]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:12.351]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:59:12.771 --> 01:59:15.732]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:59:15.732 --> 01:59:21.294]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:59:21.294 --> 01:59:28.316]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:59:28.316 --> 01:59:32.877]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:59:33.157 --> 01:59:36.440]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:38.542]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:38.542 --> 01:59:44.268]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:59:44.268 --> 01:59:46.690]  Check it out at PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:46.690 --> 01:59:52.195]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:59:52.195 --> 01:59:54.817]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.842 --> 02:00:29.755]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[02:00:29.755 --> 02:00:33.118]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.118 --> 02:00:40.303]  Stefan Molyneux, freedomainradio.com is our guest for another five minutes, then I'm going to open the phones up, cover a bunch of news, get to a bunch of clips I haven't hit yet.
[02:00:42.563 --> 02:00:45.285]  The reason I get so serious about this is I know history.
[02:00:45.285 --> 02:00:46.986]  It's from all different sides.
[02:00:46.986 --> 02:00:49.007]  It's incontrovertible what we're facing.
[02:00:49.007 --> 02:00:56.771]  The globalists are a group of capitalists that have decided to create a monopoly and then use socialism and communism to control us.
[02:00:56.771 --> 02:00:59.793]  They write white papers admitting it by the thousands.
[02:00:59.793 --> 02:01:01.394]  I mentioned Tragedy and Hope several times today.
[02:01:01.394 --> 02:01:02.635]  That's an 1100 page book.
[02:01:04.255 --> 02:01:05.495]  This is in our opinion.
[02:01:05.495 --> 02:01:08.616]  It's not my opinion that they were spying on Trump.
[02:01:08.616 --> 02:01:09.416]  They admitted they were.
[02:01:09.416 --> 02:01:14.218]  It's not my opinion Obamacare was written by insurance companies to screw you over and raise prices.
[02:01:14.218 --> 02:01:16.738]  And you not have an open market.
[02:01:16.738 --> 02:01:22.560]  And so we just kind of hit that point where you have a lot of losers that imagine they're part of the power structure.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:25.540]  And that goes for Republican Blue Bloods and others as well.
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:27.441]  You know, I'm with the establishment.
[02:01:27.441 --> 02:01:28.561]  I'm compromising.
[02:01:28.561 --> 02:01:30.502]  You can't compromise with cancer.
[02:01:30.502 --> 02:01:31.882]  Stephon, other points my friend.
[02:01:33.010 --> 02:01:41.500]  Well, I think it's important to remember when you're looking at the American political landscape, not just the Western political landscape as a whole, is that the leftists have lost the war of ideas.
[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:50.410]  You could argue they lost the war of ideas almost a century ago when Ludwig von Mises published his great works against socialism and collectivism and central planning and so on.
[02:01:50.410 --> 02:01:51.452]  The left has lost the war.
[02:01:51.912 --> 02:01:52.473]  Of ideas.
[02:01:52.473 --> 02:01:54.814]  And this is why they're turning to censorship.
[02:01:54.814 --> 02:02:01.360]  This is why they're turning to outright vote-buying in general, just by offering more and more government programs to more and more people.
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.181]  And it's hard to understand things like Obamacare.
[02:02:03.181 --> 02:02:07.204]  I mean, the left has wanted single-payer healthcare for decades, but why do they want it?
[02:02:08.365 --> 02:02:09.606]  It doesn't matter if it kills or doesn't kill you.
[02:02:23.954 --> 02:02:25.476]  They regularly vote for the left.
[02:02:25.476 --> 02:02:26.898]  So why did you need Obamacare?
[02:02:26.898 --> 02:02:30.904]  Because it was really, really tough for immigrants to get the health care that they wanted.
[02:02:30.904 --> 02:02:31.805]  So they had to pass that.
[02:02:31.805 --> 02:02:33.888]  Not because they care about people's health care.
[02:02:33.888 --> 02:02:36.732]  If they did, there wouldn't be so many kids being drugged in schools.
[02:02:36.732 --> 02:02:38.594]  They'd shut that down right away, in my opinion.
[02:02:39.335 --> 02:02:45.556]  What they want to do is they're constantly trying to get people in, bribe money, print money, who are going to vote for the left.
[02:02:45.556 --> 02:02:46.056]  Why?
[02:02:46.056 --> 02:02:48.397]  Because they have no arguments whatsoever.
[02:02:48.397 --> 02:02:54.938]  Their arguments have been defied by history, by logic, by economics, by the mounting pile of bodies of socialism around the world.
[02:02:54.938 --> 02:02:59.039]  That's being added to now, people hunting for rats and pigeons in the sewers of Venezuela.
[02:02:59.039 --> 02:03:08.981]  So they've lost the argument for ideas and now it has all become manipulation, it has become ballot stuffing, it has become illegal immigration, and it has become massive vote buying in the form of government programs.
[02:03:09.141 --> 02:03:19.433]  The world out to be in charge for another week even though it all collapses and the elites are running off to like the Pacific everywhere, Tasmania, Kauai, you name it, admitting they think it's all going to collapse.
[02:03:19.433 --> 02:03:19.653]  Wow!
[02:03:20.632 --> 02:03:21.253]  Well, it is.
[02:03:21.253 --> 02:03:28.719]  And all you have to do is ask yourself, if illegal immigrants voted for Republicans, would the Democrats be so keen on having them in?
[02:03:28.719 --> 02:03:30.600]  And everybody knows deep down what the answer is.
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:32.362]  They're being used as human pawns.
[02:03:32.362 --> 02:03:34.443]  They're not being used as individuals.
[02:03:34.443 --> 02:03:36.425]  They're not being appreciated as individuals.
[02:03:36.425 --> 02:03:44.992]  They're being used as objects for the addict to get his power lust, the one drug that drives them mad and might bring us all down if we don't fight their addiction.
[02:03:44.992 --> 02:03:46.293]  Power, power, power!
[02:03:46.633 --> 02:03:51.505]  The greatest drug, the greatest ring, I think we know in which lava pit, metaphorically, they need to end up.
[02:03:52.529 --> 02:04:09.254]  To me, the greatest power is the thrill of seeing success of everybody, and competition, and the huge college of open ideas, and to see your children with other children living into the future, and the dreams of humanity, and having individualism, and just all the incredible choices it gives us.
[02:04:09.254 --> 02:04:14.556]  It's so sexy compared to doddering Pelosi and Kim Jong-un.
[02:04:14.556 --> 02:04:21.838]  Every state-run thing always has, like, this pathetic creature at the head of it, like Hitler was a pathetic little rat creature.
[02:04:22.478 --> 02:04:25.340]  It's like, what the hell is this?
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:29.222]  It is the greatest glory in humanity, which is a choice of ideas.
[02:04:29.222 --> 02:04:32.363]  You know, when I grew up in England, Alex, we had three channels.
[02:04:32.363 --> 02:04:38.386]  Two of them, I think, were owned by the government and, you know, the corporation, which you were forced to pay for, Jimmy Savile.
[02:04:38.386 --> 02:04:39.747]  So, I grew up with two channels.
[02:04:39.747 --> 02:04:42.748]  Now, you flip on your computer, you have an infinite choices.
[02:04:42.748 --> 02:04:43.869]  I love the competition.
[02:04:43.869 --> 02:04:44.870]  I love the openness.
[02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:47.111]  There's no shortage of audience for the truth.
[02:04:47.111 --> 02:04:50.472]  I think we just keep speaking the truth, keep passionately bringing it into their mind.
[02:04:51.793 --> 02:04:56.978]  Yeah, because they can shut you and I down, 10 more will sprout up because people now have the taste for a larger palate.
[02:04:56.978 --> 02:04:58.900]  Stephan Molyneux, amazing, thank you.
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:04:59.160]  Thank you.
[02:05:00.322 --> 02:05:08.007]  While some liberal cities are fighting for the rights of law-breaking non-citizen migrants, others are cutting funds to schools that are too white.
[02:05:08.007 --> 02:05:17.253]  Walter Reed Middle School in North Hollywood is having funds cut because their school student body is too white, and this has led to layoffs and increased class sizes.
[02:05:17.253 --> 02:05:18.614]  Think schools have issues?
[02:05:18.614 --> 02:05:20.676]  Leave it to Democrats to make it worse.
[02:05:20.676 --> 02:05:22.377]  Think about this if the tables were turned.
[02:05:22.657 --> 02:05:29.662]  If Republicans were moving funds from schools because they were too black to schools that had a more diverse student body, there would be outrage.
[02:05:29.662 --> 02:05:30.702]  And rightfully so.
[02:05:30.702 --> 02:05:36.726]  But this is what Democrats are doing while shaming anyone who makes decisions or judgments based on someone's identity.
[02:05:36.726 --> 02:05:42.570]  The Democrats make policy based on identity while shaming people who make policy based on identity.
[02:05:42.570 --> 02:05:50.375]  What do you expect in California, where they continue to elect people like Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, two mentally ill politicians?
[02:05:50.615 --> 02:05:53.559]  That appear to have no clue what's even going on.
[02:05:53.559 --> 02:05:56.903]  America, let's stop electing morons.
[02:05:56.903 --> 02:06:00.207]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:06:00.207 --> 02:06:02.030]  Today we call it bone broth.
[02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:08.438]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:08.618 --> 02:06:11.801]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[02:06:11.801 --> 02:06:21.570]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[02:06:21.570 --> 02:06:22.411]  Caveman.
[02:06:22.411 --> 02:06:27.496]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:27.496 --> 02:06:29.598]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:29.898 --> 02:06:33.060]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:38.184]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:38.184 --> 02:06:46.329]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:46.329 --> 02:06:54.135]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:54.135 --> 02:06:58.938]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself, and forwardslife.com today.
[02:06:59.707 --> 02:07:00.508]  Hey, everyone!
[02:07:00.508 --> 02:07:02.810]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:06.653]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:07:06.653 --> 02:07:08.735]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:07:08.735 --> 02:07:19.004]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:07:19.004 --> 02:07:24.990]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:07:25.450 --> 02:07:40.367]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:07:40.407 --> 02:07:40.808]  I think so.
[02:08:05.333 --> 02:08:14.998]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[02:08:14.998 --> 02:08:17.279]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[02:08:17.279 --> 02:08:23.582]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:23.582 --> 02:08:28.064]  And the colors of the sea blind your eyes with trembling mammoths.
[02:08:28.064 --> 02:08:32.746]  You know, I gotta hand it to the pedophile networks that pretty much run the planet.
[02:08:34.109 --> 02:08:37.371]  You got a lot of nerve.
[02:08:37.371 --> 02:08:43.295]  But the people are about to strike back, politically.
[02:08:43.295 --> 02:08:47.438]  They had this Washington Post writer and it's been syndicated across the country.
[02:08:47.438 --> 02:08:51.201]  I'm told it was like the paper this morning, some family read it.
[02:08:51.201 --> 02:08:53.402]  Salt Lake City Tribune, Washington Post, you name it.
[02:08:53.402 --> 02:08:58.746]  Margaret Sullivan, Alex Jones, sorry, excuse for an apology.
[02:08:58.746 --> 02:09:03.469]  You know, I'm gonna show you, Margaret Sullivan, some of the folks we're talking about, like Jerry Epstein and
[02:09:05.219 --> 02:09:24.497]  The criminal investigation is Anthony Wiener and we're going to show you some of the big pedophile arrests going on around the country and kids getting found in little cages and then you point your finger at me when I say we've covered a lot of news reports and there have been false reports out there that we've mentioned concerning a pizza place and then you act like we're fake news like you because of that.
[02:09:24.497 --> 02:09:27.880]  You sit there on your high horse shaking your finger at me.
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:31.043]  I took the high road on something because I have integrity.
[02:09:32.847 --> 02:09:36.369]  And because when I cover things, it needs to be documented.
[02:09:36.369 --> 02:09:47.513]  We're swimming in an ocean of crimes against children and networks covering it up to such a massive level that for probably 10 years I've been in retreat from it.
[02:09:47.513 --> 02:09:49.654]  And I had an epiphany this weekend, I'm going to talk about the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:54.645 --> 02:10:04.509]  Ended up hiring Paul Watson because he created a giant online database and was posting up to 10 articles a day of mainstream news in England where they were catching giant pedophile rings everywhere.
[02:10:04.509 --> 02:10:09.050]  Satanism, murder of children, you name it.
[02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:14.072]  And I was covering it and I started having Paul write for InfoWars 16 years ago.
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:35.645]  And I've never seen Paul so pissed yesterday as he was in the fourth hour when he brought all this up and what they're saying about all this because clearly what this has become is MSM has come out with all these articles saying Alex Jones admits he's a liar, there's no pedophilia in the elite, there's no corruption, nothing's happening.
[02:10:35.645 --> 02:10:36.666]  That's not what I said.
[02:10:37.822 --> 02:10:45.246]  I said, yeah, there were articles out there about a basement in the place and menus that weren't real in some cases, and we didn't create those.
[02:10:45.246 --> 02:10:46.947]  We didn't report on them for weeks.
[02:10:46.947 --> 02:10:50.189]  Our listeners got mad and said, look at this, and we're like, God, that looks pretty crazy.
[02:10:50.189 --> 02:10:53.251]  Plus they had some rock bands there saying things I'm not going to repeat, you know.
[02:10:53.911 --> 02:10:59.333]  And then the media turned it into this whole hysteria and said it was my, my, my, my story.
[02:10:59.333 --> 02:11:00.394]  And I said, no it's not.
[02:11:00.394 --> 02:11:04.175]  And stop attaching me to whatever new stuff MSN basically makes up.
[02:11:04.175 --> 02:11:05.176]  Because I figured it out.
[02:11:05.176 --> 02:11:10.658]  MSN was finding the most obscure rumors online that they were probably posting.
[02:11:10.658 --> 02:11:11.818]  Media's been caught doing this before.
[02:11:11.818 --> 02:11:12.739]  False flagging.
[02:11:12.739 --> 02:11:14.359]  And then saying I said it.
[02:11:14.359 --> 02:11:17.501]  I didn't say Hillary was at the bottom of this pizza place killing people.
[02:11:17.501 --> 02:11:18.221]  It's a damn lie.
[02:11:19.448 --> 02:11:24.469]  They edited tapes of me on NPR, on CNN, on Fox, everywhere.
[02:11:24.469 --> 02:11:29.391]  My lawyers say I have a case, by the way, but I don't have the time to mess with it.
[02:11:29.391 --> 02:11:33.492]  Where I said she's a mass murderer for Syria and Libya and killed all these kids.
[02:11:33.492 --> 02:11:34.532]  She's responsible.
[02:11:34.532 --> 02:11:40.934]  They edited that to what I said it was in a pizza place.
[02:11:40.934 --> 02:11:42.414]  And then I come out and I clarify.
[02:11:45.976 --> 02:11:50.870]  Because people are innocent until proven guilty and I don't, I think most stuff said about that place is wrong.
[02:11:51.792 --> 02:12:03.959]  That's the very definition of coming out and being honest, and they use that to lie all over the news about... Jones now says his outrageous theory that Hillary's connected to pedophilia was all a lie!
[02:12:03.959 --> 02:12:05.220]  Didn't say that.
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:16.727]  Hillary Clinton is up to her eyeballs with pedophiles and pedophilia and representing pedophiles and Jerry Epstein and Weiner, and we told you first, the child porn investigation, before it was in the news.
[02:12:16.727 --> 02:12:20.329]  We have real law enforcement sources, just like we do on Hillary falling down.
[02:12:23.649 --> 02:12:28.330]  I mean, you see the guests we have on?
[02:12:28.330 --> 02:12:37.353]  Former top CIA contractors, like Mr. Parenteau and countless others.
[02:12:37.353 --> 02:12:40.154]  I mean, you think, I mean, obviously the President calls me.
[02:12:40.154 --> 02:12:41.194]  I talk to the President.
[02:12:41.194 --> 02:12:42.375]  Yes, I got big sources.
[02:12:44.266 --> 02:12:47.028]  And I told you the President's going to start going after all this.
[02:12:47.028 --> 02:12:52.791]  But I read people like Margaret Sullivan weighing in with her holy other than thou crap.
[02:12:52.791 --> 02:13:00.255]  Hey Margaret, where's your article about Madeleine Albright and the half million Iraqi kids died under Madeleine Albright's sanctions with Bill Clinton and they were a good price to pay?
[02:13:00.255 --> 02:13:03.136]  And she gets off on talking about dead kids.
[02:13:03.136 --> 02:13:03.617]  Hey lady!
[02:13:04.557 --> 02:13:07.118]  Forget pedophilia, what about that, lady?
[02:13:07.118 --> 02:13:10.179]  You don't have jack squat to say, just like you don't about Hillary.
[02:13:10.179 --> 02:13:23.284]  I came, I saw he died, putting the jihadis in over 15 countries, murdering hundreds of thousands of Syria alone, blowing up hundreds of churches, throwing gay people off buildings, and I'm upset and you call me an Islamophobe?
[02:13:23.284 --> 02:13:32.407]  Because I don't like wholesale, from Cairo, Egypt to Aleppo, Syria, tens of thousands of gays being murdered?
[02:13:34.465 --> 02:13:35.646]  Those are just people to me!
[02:13:35.646 --> 02:13:43.912]  I don't care what their sexual preference is, I'm pissed off!
[02:13:43.912 --> 02:13:56.681]  But you just sit there and you dehumanize me, and you take my heartfelt correction, and the media twists the living hell out of it, to then say, Jones admits he made it all up, the Clintons aren't connected to pedophilia.
[02:13:56.681 --> 02:13:59.603]  Ha!
[02:13:59.603 --> 02:14:01.785]  You're right, they're not connected, they are pedophilia.
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:06.222]  Hillary Clinton is a murderer of children.
[02:14:06.222 --> 02:14:09.303]  Hillary Clinton is a degenerate witch.
[02:14:09.303 --> 02:14:10.604]  Then they have the 60 Minutes pieces.
[02:14:10.604 --> 02:14:11.825]  Oh, Hillary's not even sick.
[02:14:11.825 --> 02:14:12.626]  Look, they murdered her.
[02:14:12.626 --> 02:14:13.806]  She never even fell down.
[02:14:13.806 --> 02:14:18.209]  They show you edited video that doesn't show her falling down, when a few seconds later she does.
[02:14:18.209 --> 02:14:19.530]  My God!
[02:14:19.530 --> 02:14:20.891]  How discredited is the 60 Minutes?
[02:14:20.891 --> 02:14:26.094]  If I had somebody on the street this morning, I was in a bank.
[02:14:26.094 --> 02:14:27.835]  Walk up to me when I was closing an account.
[02:14:32.073 --> 02:14:34.515]  There was a liberal area, Austin, and the tellers could hardly even talk.
[02:14:34.515 --> 02:14:38.600]  They were so freaked out, I was there just staring and shaking their heads like the devil had come in.
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:43.985]  And this guy goes, oh, I saw your buddy Cernovich on 60 Minutes.
[02:14:43.985 --> 02:14:45.406]  Boy, he got destroyed.
[02:14:45.406 --> 02:14:45.887]  Oh, yeah.
[02:14:45.887 --> 02:14:53.835]  And I was like, what, because some arrogant, swole-up host we don't even know the name of sat there and made jokes that he said Hillary fell down?
[02:14:55.697 --> 02:15:01.742]  And, like, the guy was trying to make me, like, feel small, like, oh yeah, I'm surprised you weren't on there.
[02:15:01.742 --> 02:15:03.683]  And I said, do you even know the name of that host on there?
[02:15:03.683 --> 02:15:04.604]  And he goes, no, I don't.
[02:15:04.604 --> 02:15:07.306]  I go, notice that.
[02:15:07.306 --> 02:15:11.810]  We should know Mike Wallace and Stahl and all their names, didn't we?
[02:15:11.810 --> 02:15:13.271]  You don't know their name now.
[02:15:13.271 --> 02:15:15.273]  What does that mean?
[02:15:15.273 --> 02:15:16.494]  And the guy's like, what does it mean?
[02:15:16.494 --> 02:15:20.397]  I went, it means you weren't conscious while you were watching it and they're not stars anymore.
[02:15:22.179 --> 02:15:23.700]  Nobody knows their name.
[02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:27.782]  You know my name, and you know my guest name, Mike Cernovich.
[02:15:27.782 --> 02:15:33.125]  You don't know the host name in his big suit, laughing at Cernovich.
[02:15:33.125 --> 02:15:37.067]  And Cernovich laughs back!
[02:15:37.067 --> 02:15:45.612]  I mean, I sat there and had Senior Secret Service tell me, she's having convulsions every 30 minutes to every 45 minutes.
[02:15:45.612 --> 02:15:46.233]  Follow her.
[02:15:46.233 --> 02:15:47.733]  There's a black ambulance.
[02:15:47.733 --> 02:15:49.675]  It's getting worse.
[02:15:49.675 --> 02:15:50.355]  You'll catch it.
[02:15:52.662 --> 02:15:53.542]  And then it happened.
[02:15:53.542 --> 02:15:54.643]  I said it on air.
[02:15:54.643 --> 02:15:55.903]  She's falling down.
[02:15:55.903 --> 02:15:57.144]  She's in a black ambulance.
[02:15:57.144 --> 02:15:59.124]  You see it happen three weeks later.
[02:15:59.124 --> 02:16:04.887]  And their answer is... The Clinton campaign said she's in great health.
[02:16:04.887 --> 02:16:09.628]  Well, the Clinton campaign may say that baboons don't have purple butts, but they do, bro!
[02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:09.668]  So...
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:19.801]  Scott Pele, I guess is his name.
[02:16:19.801 --> 02:16:28.046]  I mean, you talk about a fake, arrogant, a feat, stuffed shirt guy that takes himself seriously.
[02:16:28.046 --> 02:16:29.587]  Here, let me act like Scott Pele.
[02:16:29.587 --> 02:16:32.048]  Oh, you do know?
[02:16:32.048 --> 02:16:36.030]  Oh, you want to say that?
[02:16:36.030 --> 02:16:39.372]  The campaign says Hillary is totally well.
[02:16:39.372 --> 02:16:44.515]  I mean, I mean, it's like a cartoon character.
[02:16:46.889 --> 02:16:51.915]  You're like, hey, the sky's blue, Scott Pele.
[02:16:51.915 --> 02:16:54.557]  Just say it is.
[02:16:54.557 --> 02:16:59.383]  Really?
[02:16:59.383 --> 02:17:02.286]  I mean, who comes up with this?
[02:17:02.286 --> 02:17:07.392]  But see, for an unconscious person, that looks like credibility.
[02:17:07.392 --> 02:17:08.793]  To the type of folks that watch 60 Minutes.
[02:17:10.342 --> 02:17:13.564]  And you know, back in the day, 60 Minutes would report on low-level corruption.
[02:17:13.564 --> 02:17:14.704]  They wouldn't do high-level.
[02:17:14.704 --> 02:17:16.865]  But they'd show hospitals taking your organs and killing you.
[02:17:16.865 --> 02:17:18.286]  I mean, it was really going on.
[02:17:18.286 --> 02:17:22.248]  And they'd show, you know, that Chevrolet covered up exploding gas tanks.
[02:17:22.248 --> 02:17:30.753]  Now, they're just water-bearers, water-carriers.
[02:17:30.753 --> 02:17:32.093]  That's why 60 Minutes has called me.
[02:17:32.093 --> 02:17:35.455]  You know what our email says back to them?
[02:17:35.455 --> 02:17:36.896]  Make up whatever you want.
[02:17:41.428 --> 02:17:52.417]  Most people will be scrabbling, Alex, you're turning down Nightline and Discovery Channel and History Channel and CNN and MSNBC, but it's always taped.
[02:17:52.417 --> 02:17:55.760]  So they can go, why do you love Hitler, Alex?
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:58.142]  I actually had this happen in one interview.
[02:17:58.142 --> 02:18:01.685]  And then they cut to me from a separate part of the interview while they're, oh, we're changing tapes.
[02:18:01.685 --> 02:18:02.746]  Just sit there for a minute.
[02:18:02.746 --> 02:18:04.488]  You can see they're not changing tapes.
[02:18:04.488 --> 02:18:05.749]  They're looking at each other.
[02:18:05.749 --> 02:18:09.012]  They're waiting until you make a funny face or something.
[02:18:11.271 --> 02:18:12.212]  Why do you love Hitler?
[02:18:12.212 --> 02:18:21.641]  Five minutes before you're like, wait, you're like... Jones couldn't respond to why he didn't love Hitler.
[02:18:21.641 --> 02:18:24.905]  That's what Katie Couric got caught in the gun thing doing.
[02:18:24.905 --> 02:18:27.327]  Show me one example where a gun stopped crime.
[02:18:27.327 --> 02:18:30.510]  They all had a huge document of evidence.
[02:18:30.510 --> 02:18:32.192]  Just cut to all five on the panel going...
[02:18:36.664 --> 02:18:40.847]  Because they had him sit there for 30 minutes saying, oh, we're just waiting with cameras on them.
[02:18:40.847 --> 02:18:41.647]  But folks were smart.
[02:18:41.647 --> 02:18:49.712]  They were there recording the whole thing.
[02:18:49.712 --> 02:18:51.373]  Good try, scumbag.
[02:18:51.373 --> 02:18:58.737]  All right, let me be a good boy and play some clips.
[02:18:58.737 --> 02:19:00.879]  Let me be a good boy and play some clips and then open the phones up.
[02:19:00.879 --> 02:19:05.001]  I had a Roger Stone host of the fourth hour.
[02:19:05.001 --> 02:19:05.962]  Listen, here's the deal.
[02:19:07.239 --> 02:19:09.620]  If I told you we were under attack, it'd be a lie.
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:19.284]  We're under super savage, foaming at the mouth, pack of piranhas on PCP with rabies.
[02:19:19.284 --> 02:19:25.066]  A part of the New York Times article saying that piranhas can't get rabies.
[02:19:25.066 --> 02:19:25.706]  I know.
[02:19:25.706 --> 02:19:28.948]  It's a figure of speech.
[02:19:28.948 --> 02:19:30.588]  But it's a great honor.
[02:19:30.588 --> 02:19:31.869]  I love it, actually.
[02:19:31.869 --> 02:19:34.230]  Then I just don't want to lose.
[02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:36.591]  And if they can shut us down, which they're trying to do,
[02:19:37.813 --> 02:19:40.958]  You know, some of the years, I don't make a lot of these, hey, they're coming after us things.
[02:19:40.958 --> 02:19:42.361]  I mean, they're really coming after us.
[02:19:42.361 --> 02:19:43.863]  You can see it everywhere.
[02:19:43.863 --> 02:19:46.748]  And they're openly trying to lobby to shut everything we do down.
[02:19:46.748 --> 02:19:48.951]  The answer is pray for us first.
[02:19:50.484 --> 02:19:56.971]  Spread the links and know through human intelligence, human action, the articles, the videos to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[02:19:56.971 --> 02:19:58.873]  Call or talk radio, InfoWars.com.
[02:19:58.873 --> 02:20:00.295]  It's censored.
[02:20:00.295 --> 02:20:01.196]  This could backfire.
[02:20:01.196 --> 02:20:02.657]  It is backfiring.
[02:20:02.657 --> 02:20:03.919]  InfoWars is getting more traffic than ever.
[02:20:03.919 --> 02:20:05.480]  Prison Planet, more traffic than ever.
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:07.603]  If you spread the word now more than ever.
[02:20:07.603 --> 02:20:11.086]  If great folks like Drudge Report, who's linked to us today on the Michael Moore thing, keep linking to us.
[02:20:11.086 --> 02:20:12.388]  But if you keep promoting Drudge as well,
[02:20:13.763 --> 02:20:15.944]  There's not many stalwart groups out there resisting this.
[02:20:15.944 --> 02:20:19.285]  If you sign up for our free newsletters, we can send you stuff via the underground.
[02:20:19.285 --> 02:20:22.927]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:20:22.927 --> 02:20:25.408]  We can break the back of this globalist operation.
[02:20:27.042 --> 02:20:34.483]  But we've got amazing nutraceuticals and supplements, like the bone broth and turmeric and more, caveman formula that's so amazing.
[02:20:34.483 --> 02:20:41.605]  And we've got 30% off the X2 and the BioTrue Selenium right now, either individually or together.
[02:20:41.605 --> 02:20:44.165]  We've got so many other things going on at importwrestore.com.
[02:20:44.165 --> 02:20:48.846]  It's so important to make that physical contribution.
[02:20:48.846 --> 02:20:52.647]  Where you physically get something good for yourself, you help us, it's symbiotic.
[02:20:54.201 --> 02:20:54.861]  It's amazing.
[02:20:54.861 --> 02:20:56.082]  So take action today.
[02:20:56.082 --> 02:21:00.283]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:21:00.283 --> 02:21:09.366]  There's hundreds of reviews for Caveman, 4.7 star reviews on Power Reviews, third-party sites, unheard of.
[02:21:09.366 --> 02:21:12.787]  I really should just read some reviews for the products.
[02:21:12.787 --> 02:21:13.807]  Here's one.
[02:21:13.807 --> 02:21:16.208]  Super Combo, Survival Silodex II, Niacin Iodine, 30% off.
[02:21:19.121 --> 02:21:19.841]  Let me give you some of these.
[02:21:19.841 --> 02:21:23.722]  This is from Monica, an undisclosed place, 5.0.
[02:21:23.722 --> 02:21:26.123]  This is the best iodine supplement I've ever used.
[02:21:26.123 --> 02:21:29.924]  I've been taking a natural thyroid supplement for a couple of years and noticed it wasn't really working for me.
[02:21:29.924 --> 02:21:32.284]  Yeah, it's usually bound, you can't absorb it.
[02:21:32.284 --> 02:21:33.644]  For me, as well as it had at first.
[02:21:33.644 --> 02:21:35.085]  I heard about this iodine.
[02:21:35.085 --> 02:21:36.985]  I've been taking different supplements, kelp, etc.
[02:21:36.985 --> 02:21:38.186]  Decided to give it a try.
[02:21:38.186 --> 02:21:39.446]  I noticed a difference immediately.
[02:21:40.006 --> 02:21:41.207]  That's from deep-earth crystals.
[02:21:41.207 --> 02:21:42.928]  It's like alien blood.
[02:21:42.928 --> 02:21:45.730]  It'll eat through concrete before we put it in the gas form.
[02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.551]  Gotta have DEA licenses to have it.
[02:21:47.551 --> 02:21:49.392]  I mean, we got the real stuff, folks.
[02:21:49.392 --> 02:21:51.074]  Oh, you can make anything with iodine.
[02:21:51.074 --> 02:21:56.297]  It has been a year since I first purchased this product, and I've been taking it religiously every day.
[02:21:56.297 --> 02:22:00.700]  I no longer take the other thyroid supplements thanks to this amazing product.
[02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:02.361]  If you're not taking iodine, you're missing out.
[02:22:02.361 --> 02:22:03.302]  I love Infolwer's products.
[02:22:06.135 --> 02:22:10.437]  Another one, this is from Sierra, another undisclosed location, five-star review.
[02:22:10.437 --> 02:22:12.398]  Extra energy and brain boost.
[02:22:12.398 --> 02:22:14.279]  Biotricillinium is awesome.
[02:22:14.279 --> 02:22:18.761]  I take it with niacin iodine, and I feel like I have extra energy and a brain boost.
[02:22:18.761 --> 02:22:20.682]  I'll be able to accomplish the day.
[02:22:20.682 --> 02:22:22.103]  Listen to his list with ease.
[02:22:22.103 --> 02:22:22.743]  I love this product.
[02:22:22.743 --> 02:22:23.003]  Thank you.
[02:22:23.003 --> 02:22:24.044]  Would recommend it to others.
[02:22:24.044 --> 02:22:30.727]  By the way, somebody took my Biotricillinium out of here.
[02:22:30.727 --> 02:22:31.908]  Somebody get me a bottle, please.
[02:22:31.908 --> 02:22:33.849]  I didn't mean to take that.
[02:22:33.849 --> 02:22:34.089]  Thank you.
[02:22:36.212 --> 02:22:37.153]  Oh, actually, I found it.
[02:22:37.153 --> 02:22:38.114]  It's fallen down the floor.
[02:22:38.114 --> 02:22:39.635]  I got it.
[02:22:39.635 --> 02:22:41.697]  When I forget to take it, I have less energy.
[02:22:41.697 --> 02:22:43.378]  Now, I'll be honest.
[02:22:43.378 --> 02:22:47.441]  Whatever it does in the body, it maximizes the hormones and stuff you've already got.
[02:22:47.441 --> 02:22:48.762]  That's what they said in the literature.
[02:22:48.762 --> 02:22:50.224]  When I take it every day, I have more energy.
[02:22:50.224 --> 02:22:50.764]  I lose weight.
[02:22:50.764 --> 02:22:52.726]  I feel great.
[02:22:52.726 --> 02:22:57.790]  The hair falls out, which I don't really mind, but that's a well-known thing with selenium.
[02:22:57.790 --> 02:23:02.294]  If it's bio-true, if it's real selenium from mustard seed, it'll, you know,
[02:23:04.244 --> 02:23:05.425]  Being a man's got side effects.
[02:23:05.425 --> 02:23:06.866]  Who needs hair?
[02:23:06.866 --> 02:23:10.328]  I mean, quite frankly, I just don't like being the in-between point, you know?
[02:23:10.328 --> 02:23:14.631]  I mean, women love it when you're manly and you've got your head shaved.
[02:23:14.631 --> 02:23:20.735]  I mean, it's all just more Madison Avenue, Hollywood crap that women don't like if you don't have a bunch of hair on your head.
[02:23:20.735 --> 02:23:25.678]  It's a load of BS, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:25.678 --> 02:23:26.138]  There you go.
[02:23:26.138 --> 02:23:30.021]  I just took my Slim and Dribble stuff down my shirt.
[02:23:30.021 --> 02:23:32.383]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and
[02:23:33.601 --> 02:23:40.226]  To say you're funding the tip of the spear is a cliche, but we're it, folks.
[02:23:40.226 --> 02:23:46.690]  I'm just absolutely honored to be here with you and I love you all and I appreciate you.
[02:23:46.690 --> 02:23:52.234]  And let's go ahead and shift into what I mentioned earlier.
[02:23:52.234 --> 02:23:52.474]  Here we go.
[02:23:57.964 --> 02:24:08.571]  During the last break, I was back there in the coffee room, in the break room, and they had CNN on.
[02:24:08.571 --> 02:24:15.436]  And they were like, the Russian narrative, understanding the scandal that could bring down Trump, is he a Russian agent?
[02:24:15.436 --> 02:24:25.963]  So now, it's not just that his people are Russian agents for daring to talk to the Russians like they're supposed to, now he's a Russian agent, and Nunes is a Russian agent, and Rand Paul's a Russian agent, they've said it, and I'm a Russian agent,
[02:24:27.657 --> 02:24:30.559]  Never been to Russia, no Russian blood, nothing.
[02:24:30.559 --> 02:24:34.661]  We have one great Russian-American army veteran here, she's a great lady.
[02:24:34.661 --> 02:24:38.323]  A lot more Russians are like her.
[02:24:38.323 --> 02:24:43.666]  But we're to the point, I gotta say, yeah, out of 70 people, we got a Russian here.
[02:24:43.666 --> 02:24:47.528]  Because I'm under criminal investigation to see if I'm getting directives from the Russians.
[02:24:47.528 --> 02:24:51.150]  Does that mean Obama's FBI stay-behind groups got on our servers and planted something?
[02:24:51.826 --> 02:24:53.767]  Hello, comrade, yes, what do I do?
[02:24:53.767 --> 02:25:02.330]  I promote borders and sovereignty and the family and Christianity and defeating radical Islam and bringing our jobs back and making America totally dominant.
[02:25:02.330 --> 02:25:03.990]  Thank you for wanting us to be dominant, Putin.
[02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:07.892]  Thank you, Putin!
[02:25:07.892 --> 02:25:11.413]  But remember, it was in the New York Times everywhere that they saved intelligence.
[02:25:11.413 --> 02:25:11.813]  They had it.
[02:25:11.813 --> 02:25:19.676]  They were giving it leaks to the media showing Trump was under Russian control, but then there was nothing really there, so they had to back off and said Trump wasn't saying it.
[02:25:19.676 --> 02:25:20.616]  I know you know this, but
[02:25:23.208 --> 02:25:25.890]  I'm watching this and unmasking names and all of it.
[02:25:25.890 --> 02:25:26.970]  They did it!
[02:25:26.970 --> 02:25:28.171]  They admitted they wiretapped.
[02:25:28.171 --> 02:25:29.272]  They admitted they did it.
[02:25:29.272 --> 02:25:33.714]  So the Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence of Russian election hacking and shared it with the media.
[02:25:33.714 --> 02:25:41.959]  Matthew Rosenberg, who goes on TV and says I'm insane and made all this up.
[02:25:41.959 --> 02:25:47.903]  But then meanwhile, it's up on Infowars.com, Obama defense deputy admitted spying on Trump.
[02:25:49.312 --> 02:25:50.192]  Paul says, did they?
[02:25:50.192 --> 02:25:51.593]  I mean, she did.
[02:25:51.593 --> 02:25:58.156]  Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Evelyn Farkas, has caused controversy, as she appeared to admit during an appearance on MSNBC.
[02:25:58.156 --> 02:26:00.137]  So that's the old propaganda.
[02:26:00.137 --> 02:26:02.118]  Say you have the evidence, you spied.
[02:26:02.118 --> 02:26:04.219]  They're like, wait, you're not supposed to say that.
[02:26:04.219 --> 02:26:04.980]  They have no memories.
[02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:07.641]  We're telling them that never happened.
[02:26:07.641 --> 02:26:12.683]  Farkas explained to Mika Brzezinski, who literally her father has sworn to destroy Russia.
[02:26:12.683 --> 02:26:13.784]  He just hates Russia.
[02:26:17.239 --> 02:26:19.020]  Most polls don't hate Russia, he does.
[02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:20.281]  He's completely insane.
[02:26:20.281 --> 02:26:27.166]  The Obama administration scrambled to gather information about the Trump team's alleged ties to Russia.
[02:26:27.166 --> 02:26:28.127]  And it goes on.
[02:26:28.127 --> 02:26:35.412]  She was the former head for the Pentagon and the State Department, she was advisor there, of the entire U.S.-Russian, anti-Russian operation.
[02:26:35.412 --> 02:26:37.033]  Just look at this whack job.
[02:26:37.033 --> 02:26:42.417]  But she goes on and tells the truth, then they flip out.
[02:26:42.417 --> 02:26:45.880]  She was the woman deploying the $5 billion against Ukraine to overthrow their government, all of it.
[02:26:46.789 --> 02:26:49.170]  And they're like, hey, lady, you're not supposed to admit it.
[02:26:49.170 --> 02:26:50.370]  She's like, but it was in the newspaper.
[02:26:50.370 --> 02:26:51.631]  I ran the operation.
[02:26:51.631 --> 02:26:52.971]  Just, no, you didn't.
[02:26:52.971 --> 02:26:54.552]  Okay, now Trump's a liar.
[02:26:54.552 --> 02:26:57.293]  It's totally insane that he ever was spied on.
[02:26:57.293 --> 02:26:57.733]  You understand?
[02:26:57.733 --> 02:26:59.034]  She's like, no, he was.
[02:26:59.034 --> 02:26:59.894]  He's a Russian.
[02:26:59.894 --> 02:27:01.274]  We have the evidence.
[02:27:01.274 --> 02:27:03.795]  When he was in the transition, he talked to him.
[02:27:03.795 --> 02:27:05.676]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[02:27:05.676 --> 02:27:06.977]  He talked to Nunes.
[02:27:06.977 --> 02:27:07.637]  Did you hear?
[02:27:07.637 --> 02:27:09.357]  He talked to the head of the House Intelligence Committee.
[02:27:09.357 --> 02:27:13.379]  And Trey Gowdy goes, who are you supposed to talk to?
[02:27:13.379 --> 02:27:15.980]  I mean, soon Trump can't talk to his own family.
[02:27:16.806 --> 02:27:18.827]  Trump was seen today talking to someone.
[02:27:18.827 --> 02:27:20.527]  He's an agent.
[02:27:20.527 --> 02:27:23.708]  The globalists are the ones destroying our country, not the Russians.
[02:27:23.708 --> 02:27:27.690]  We have common ground with Russia and everybody else that wants out from under this.
[02:27:27.690 --> 02:27:30.391]  Japan wants to make a deal with Trump to be actually free.
[02:27:30.391 --> 02:27:33.532]  Now from under there, they've never been free.
[02:27:33.532 --> 02:27:40.814]  They were organized as an engine of deindustrialization for the elites to siphon off the money the Japanese made into China and the sellout of America and Japan.
[02:27:40.814 --> 02:27:41.715]  Japan gets it.
[02:27:41.715 --> 02:27:44.616]  They're ready to get in bed with us all the way.
[02:27:44.616 --> 02:27:45.436]  So South Korea.
[02:27:47.008 --> 02:27:48.229]  Trump knows what's going on, folks.
[02:27:48.229 --> 02:27:53.712]  That's why these people that want to play God over us are crapping their polka-dotted drawers.
[02:27:53.712 --> 02:28:00.057]  So let's go to this former Obama head of Russia operations for the Pentagon, admitting they were spying on Trump.
[02:28:00.057 --> 02:28:00.357]  Here it is.
[02:28:01.501 --> 02:28:08.026]  Well, I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill.
[02:28:08.026 --> 02:28:11.229]  Obama officials race to preserve Russian Trail.
[02:28:11.229 --> 02:28:15.252]  That was the version of print that they then had online.
[02:28:15.252 --> 02:28:15.732]  But start it over.
[02:28:15.732 --> 02:28:15.992]  Here it is.
[02:28:17.537 --> 02:28:39.257]  Well, I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration, because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left, so it would be hidden away.
[02:28:39.677 --> 02:28:56.730]  In the bureaucracy, that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about the Trump staffs dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence.
[02:28:56.730 --> 02:29:02.394]  So I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open and I knew that there was more.
[02:29:02.394 --> 02:29:04.015]  We have very good intelligence on Russia.
[02:29:04.415 --> 02:29:11.558]  So, then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill.
[02:29:11.558 --> 02:29:12.919]  A lot going on today.
[02:29:12.919 --> 02:29:13.139]  Yeah.
[02:29:13.139 --> 02:29:15.600]  That's why you have the leaking.
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:17.381]  The circle is now complete.
[02:29:17.381 --> 02:29:24.344]  We're spying on him, we have all the proof, but there's not proof, plus the leak's illegal, so we were never spying, he's insane.
[02:29:24.344 --> 02:29:27.806]  Now, back to, we were spying, we have all the evidence.
[02:29:32.371 --> 02:29:34.493]  Something tells me this lady ain't going to make America great again.
[02:29:34.493 --> 02:29:35.714]  They don't want our taxes cut.
[02:29:35.714 --> 02:29:38.496]  They don't want to secure our borders.
[02:29:38.496 --> 02:29:41.938]  She ought to get with the Russian program of making us great again.
[02:29:41.938 --> 02:29:47.022]  Just like Trump did by turning the coal back on that devastated the Russian gas exports.
[02:29:47.022 --> 02:29:48.683]  But that's what Russia would want, right?
[02:29:48.683 --> 02:29:49.824]  To devastate their gas exports?
[02:29:49.824 --> 02:29:51.786]  We'll be back.
[02:29:51.786 --> 02:29:53.027]  Stay with us.
[02:29:53.027 --> 02:29:55.709]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.447 --> 02:30:16.709]  Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas has caused controversy after she appeared on MSNBC and said the Obama administration spied on Donald Trump in order to gather intelligence for political purposes.
[02:30:16.869 --> 02:30:20.632]  Get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration.
[02:30:20.632 --> 02:30:34.703]  Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staff's dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence.
[02:30:34.703 --> 02:30:40.307]  Then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill.
[02:30:40.367 --> 02:30:41.668]  Well, it appears Ms.
[02:30:41.668 --> 02:30:54.777]  Farkas was so caught up in the discussion that she didn't even realize the significant admissions she was making about Obama spying on Trump's team and releasing classified intelligence to the public.
[02:30:54.777 --> 02:30:56.178]  That's why you have the leaking.
[02:30:56.178 --> 02:31:02.823]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:02.823 --> 02:31:04.244]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[02:31:04.244 --> 02:31:05.064]  Devon in Florida.
[02:31:05.064 --> 02:31:05.525]  You're on the air.
[02:31:06.471 --> 02:31:06.931]  Great!
[02:31:06.931 --> 02:31:08.052]  Hey, thank you so much.

[02:31:12.573 --> 02:31:14.274]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[02:31:14.274 --> 02:31:21.676]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[02:31:21.676 --> 02:31:22.436]  Wow, thank you.
[02:31:22.436 --> 02:31:25.097]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[02:31:25.097 --> 02:31:26.898]  Which Nutraceutical does you like best?
[02:31:26.898 --> 02:31:30.379]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[02:31:30.379 --> 02:31:30.839]  That's amazing.
[02:31:31.059 --> 02:31:34.720]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:36.080]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:00.339 --> 02:32:08.764]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.

[02:32:21.711 --> 02:32:22.551]  Caveman.
[02:32:22.551 --> 02:32:29.735]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:30.035 --> 02:32:33.196]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:33.196 --> 02:32:38.317]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:38.317 --> 02:32:46.480]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:54.322]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:54.322 --> 02:32:59.063]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself, and forwardslife.com today.
[02:33:02.475 --> 02:33:06.060]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:10.225]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:31.305 --> 02:33:34.808]  All right, we've covered a plethora of news today, to say the least.
[02:33:34.808 --> 02:33:39.292]  I'd like to open the phones up until Roger Stone joins us to cover whatever issue you want to hit on.
[02:33:39.292 --> 02:33:44.877]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:44.877 --> 02:33:45.337]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:45.337 --> 02:33:47.659]  Not first-time callers.
[02:33:47.659 --> 02:33:50.582]  Anybody who wants to call, agree, disagree, whatever the case is.
[02:33:50.582 --> 02:33:54.045]  I said probably sometime this week, open the phones up for Democrats.
[02:33:55.379 --> 02:34:08.676]  I know you're listening to really tell me how Trump's bad and hasn't gotten the best small business numbers since 1984 and the best consumer confidence index in 16 years and the media celebrating his defeat!
[02:34:08.676 --> 02:34:10.558]  He didn't get Obamacare repealed the first try!
[02:34:10.558 --> 02:34:11.159]  Oh my God!
[02:34:11.159 --> 02:34:12.020]  It's incredible!
[02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:14.063]  It took Obama three years to pass it!
[02:34:18.635 --> 02:34:21.337]  And like, in the same programs on CNN.
[02:34:21.337 --> 02:34:22.939]  He's crazy, no one spied on him.
[02:34:22.939 --> 02:34:25.982]  But we spied on him and we have the evidence.
[02:34:25.982 --> 02:34:36.311]  And it's not lost on these audiences that in the same programs they'll contradict themselves.
[02:34:36.311 --> 02:34:37.632]  The same people!
[02:34:37.632 --> 02:34:39.734]  It's like they said, we're at war against logic.
[02:34:39.734 --> 02:34:42.877]  Just be as illogical and lie as much as possible.
[02:34:42.877 --> 02:34:44.398]  In fact, since the election they've gone from
[02:34:45.407 --> 02:34:56.474]  Being horrible liars before the election, to being unbelievable liars during it, to now, like a cult, religiously committing to the most fantastical lies.
[02:34:56.474 --> 02:34:57.495]  We're spying on Trump.
[02:34:57.495 --> 02:34:59.216]  We have all the evidence, blah, blah, blah.
[02:34:59.216 --> 02:35:00.276]  Then, of course, there is no evidence.
[02:35:00.276 --> 02:35:01.437]  We were never spying on him.
[02:35:01.437 --> 02:35:03.238]  So, of course, we were spying on him.
[02:35:03.238 --> 02:35:08.822]  We never said we weren't spying.
[02:35:08.822 --> 02:35:09.942]  I know I'm obsessed on this.
[02:35:09.942 --> 02:35:12.764]  It's just, it's like everything they do.
[02:35:12.764 --> 02:35:14.125]  It's just crazy.
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:19.381]  Trump's the biggest failure, biggest failure in American history.
[02:35:19.381 --> 02:35:21.122]  Yeah, sure.
[02:35:21.122 --> 02:35:22.442]  Trump works for the elites.
[02:35:22.442 --> 02:35:23.362]  I'm Noam Chomsky.
[02:35:23.362 --> 02:35:25.503]  Yeah, sure.
[02:35:25.503 --> 02:35:32.004]  Meanwhile, in the next sentence he says, and he's scapegoating the elites and the poor Muslims.
[02:35:32.004 --> 02:35:34.265]  Can I go to these Muslim countries and be a Christian?
[02:35:34.265 --> 02:35:36.666]  Can my daughters walk down the street without hoods over their heads?
[02:35:36.666 --> 02:35:39.987]  The answer is hell no.
[02:35:39.987 --> 02:35:40.827]  So shut up!
[02:35:41.866 --> 02:35:47.208]  Stop trying to come where I'm open and I'm free and piss on me and tell me I'm bad.
[02:35:47.208 --> 02:35:47.729]  I'm done.
[02:35:47.729 --> 02:35:48.949]  I don't have any guilt.
[02:35:48.949 --> 02:35:49.609]  It's over.
[02:35:49.609 --> 02:35:50.230]  Understand?
[02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.850]  I'm pissed off.
[02:36:03.086 --> 02:36:04.407]  Oh, he mentioned this yesterday.
[02:36:04.407 --> 02:36:10.289]  Facebook helps Pakistan identify thought criminals and have them arrested so they can be hung if they criticize Islam.
[02:36:10.289 --> 02:36:12.110]  I mean, good God!
[02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:15.852]  Facebook is just proving itself to China.
[02:36:15.852 --> 02:36:17.073]  I wanted to repost it.
[02:36:17.073 --> 02:36:17.853]  Did we ever repost it?
[02:36:17.853 --> 02:36:19.494]  It was a big thing at the start of the show I wanted to do.
[02:36:19.494 --> 02:36:23.696]  I wanted to repost my whole analysis and then tweet it about
[02:36:27.773 --> 02:36:29.513]  I mean, it was a big deal.
[02:36:29.513 --> 02:36:36.155]  I wanted to post about how the COG, the Democratic Party, admits they're planning to overthrow Trump using shadow government.
[02:36:36.155 --> 02:36:39.595]  Or you could say, shadow government admits planning to overthrow Trump using violence.
[02:36:39.595 --> 02:36:42.216]  That was my most important thing of the day.
[02:36:42.216 --> 02:36:44.897]  That was all I wanted, was that.
[02:36:44.897 --> 02:36:49.818]  Is that posted?
[02:36:49.818 --> 02:36:50.258]  Where is it?
[02:36:50.258 --> 02:36:51.298]  It needs to be in the top title.
[02:36:52.884 --> 02:36:53.885]  I know, but I'm not mad.
[02:36:53.885 --> 02:36:55.506]  I just, like, I want to top tile that.
[02:36:55.506 --> 02:36:58.647]  I should have said do not put it in the top tile.
[02:36:58.647 --> 02:36:59.168]  It doesn't matter.
[02:36:59.168 --> 02:37:00.629]  It's no big deal.
[02:37:00.629 --> 02:37:03.570]  They're openly saying they want to kill the president and overthrow him.
[02:37:03.570 --> 02:37:07.773]  No big deal.
[02:37:07.773 --> 02:37:09.394]  I'm just in my head spinning at this point.
[02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:17.420]  Yeah, it's Dems admit shadow government plan to violently overthrow Trump.
[02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:24.085]  Let's post it as the red link, R-E-D, link on Infowars.com.
[02:37:24.085 --> 02:37:26.007]  Now, Roger Stone is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:37:26.007 --> 02:37:33.132]  I'm going to go to him briefly so he can give us a little prelude to what's coming up, and then I'm going to tweet this out.
[02:37:33.132 --> 02:37:34.613]  It was a watered-down rise over Bear Creek.
[02:37:34.613 --> 02:37:36.975]  I'm going to ask the listeners to get this out to everybody out there.
[02:37:38.814 --> 02:37:40.355]  We could have like Jeopardy music.
[02:37:40.355 --> 02:37:41.876]  The crews are awesome.
[02:37:41.876 --> 02:37:45.199]  I just, there's some like nebula thing that happens.
[02:37:45.199 --> 02:37:48.862]  Like if something's key, I should say it is not key.
[02:37:48.862 --> 02:37:49.883]  No, not the radio crew.
[02:37:49.883 --> 02:37:51.905]  The rest of the crew are great too.
[02:37:51.905 --> 02:37:53.446]  I just think that might be important.
[02:37:53.446 --> 02:37:54.567]  Somebody might care about it.
[02:37:54.567 --> 02:37:56.629]  You know, we might want to make a big deal of it.
[02:37:56.629 --> 02:37:57.890]  Tell me this, Nico.
[02:37:57.890 --> 02:38:02.934]  What section is it in?
[02:38:02.934 --> 02:38:04.515]  Hmm.
[02:38:04.515 --> 02:38:05.656]  How are we even able to find it then?
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:10.480]  It's in the RSS feed.
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:10.680]  Okay.
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:18.003]  Well hey, if there's martial law, there won't be a show.
[02:38:18.003 --> 02:38:20.444]  If I just walk off.
[02:38:20.444 --> 02:38:22.325]  Let's get a rebroadcast ready.
[02:38:22.325 --> 02:38:27.087]  Let's get a clip here ready.
[02:38:27.087 --> 02:38:28.548]  The elite want the collectivize.
[02:38:28.548 --> 02:38:30.488]  It's got John Bowne's report.
[02:38:30.488 --> 02:38:33.229]  Let's get that ready and we'll go to Roger later maybe.
[02:38:33.229 --> 02:38:33.850]  But who knows?
[02:38:33.850 --> 02:38:34.370]  Hell, you know.
[02:38:35.100 --> 02:38:35.360]  Who knows?
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:36.560]  Because it's not even a big deal.
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:39.881]  No one even cares that they're openly saying they want to overthrow the president violently.
[02:38:39.881 --> 02:38:41.042]  And they're gearing up.
[02:38:41.042 --> 02:38:43.982]  And then they're going to have to suspend Congress for six months and do all this.
[02:38:43.982 --> 02:38:45.643]  And they're openly trying to organize it.
[02:38:45.643 --> 02:38:47.063]  Doesn't matter.
[02:38:47.063 --> 02:38:47.623]  And I agree.
[02:38:47.623 --> 02:38:48.443]  I don't care either.
[02:38:48.443 --> 02:38:50.444]  Totally normal!
[02:38:50.444 --> 02:38:52.305]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[02:38:52.305 --> 02:38:53.625]  Davos man is dead.
[02:38:53.625 --> 02:38:55.225]  Bilderberg man is dead.
[02:38:55.225 --> 02:38:57.366]  The guy that founded Bilderberg literally died, as you know, a few days ago.
[02:38:57.366 --> 02:38:57.766]  That Rockefeller.
[02:38:58.959 --> 02:39:11.383]  The United Nations can and should play an essential role in helping the world find a satisfactory way of stabilizing world population.
[02:39:11.383 --> 02:39:19.045]  We are severely lacking in teaching our youth about the Constitution of the United States and about the government of the United States.
[02:39:19.045 --> 02:39:20.025]  But there's plenty of money.
[02:39:21.539 --> 02:39:25.564]  And there's plenty of help from the establishment to teach them about the United Nations.
[02:39:25.564 --> 02:39:28.828]  But in their own writings, they're saying globalism is dead.
[02:39:28.828 --> 02:39:30.690]  And they're not saying it to play possum.
[02:39:30.690 --> 02:39:34.434]  Their corrupt system is going to fall.
[02:39:34.434 --> 02:39:39.140]  Now they're just trying to steal as much money as they can and run to armored redoubts in the Pacific Ocean.
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:41.701]  Globalism is criminal.
[02:39:41.701 --> 02:39:42.782]  It is anti-human.
[02:39:42.782 --> 02:39:44.683]  It is a horrible ideology.
[02:39:44.683 --> 02:39:46.484]  The worst the world's ever seen.
[02:39:46.484 --> 02:39:55.228]  It comes out of the eugenics, social Darwinism movement that spawned the fascist like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.
[02:39:55.228 --> 02:39:56.369]  It's bad.
[02:39:56.369 --> 02:40:00.711]  And Hitler and Mussolini were unorganized morons compared to the globalists.
[02:40:00.711 --> 02:40:02.332]  But they don't care if you're white or black.
[02:40:02.332 --> 02:40:04.553]  They want to dumb everybody down and play us off.
[02:40:04.553 --> 02:40:07.434]  But they use race politics posing as the left.
[02:40:07.434 --> 02:40:08.375]  That's the global plan.
[02:40:09.115 --> 02:40:28.428]  3 million North African Muslims are waiting under the UN migration slash borders board run by the founder of the EU, Peter Sutherland, and they're ordering Europe right now, the EU under UN, talk about dictatorship, to let 3 million in in the next 6 months.
[02:40:28.428 --> 02:40:36.353]  3 million on top of the 5 million documented 80% of military age men flooding in.
[02:40:36.353 --> 02:40:37.454]  What is that plan?
[02:40:37.774 --> 02:40:45.540]  Migrants in general, and in every country in Europe, make greater fiscal contributions than they take in benefits.
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:46.381]  Alright, that's, uh...
[02:40:48.194 --> 02:40:50.556]  The Globalist is pushing the whole agenda.
[02:40:50.556 --> 02:40:53.057]  Popping in, and we're going to go to your phone calls, is Roger Stone.
[02:40:53.057 --> 02:40:56.940]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:58.201]  Roger, so much going on.
[02:40:58.201 --> 02:41:02.023]  I think the word of the hour is their whole Russia narrative has collapsed.
[02:41:02.023 --> 02:41:03.224]  They're the ones illegally spying.
[02:41:03.224 --> 02:41:04.765]  No proof of Russia.
[02:41:04.765 --> 02:41:10.009]  But expanding into that, they're now trying to openly call for us to be shut down and censored.
[02:41:10.009 --> 02:41:12.951]  David Brock is publicly going to Google asking that we be banned.
[02:41:15.025 --> 02:41:18.151]  Alex, I think that's a very good summary.
[02:41:18.151 --> 02:41:26.087]  Coming up at 3 o'clock Eastern is the Podesta Hour because now what we figured out is this entire Russian
[02:41:26.969 --> 02:41:34.275]  Trump collusion meme was invented by Podesta himself and it's ingenious.
[02:41:34.275 --> 02:41:45.364]  It distracts attention from the fact that it is he and his brother and Bill and Hillary Clinton extracting millions and millions from the clique around Putin.
[02:41:45.364 --> 02:41:55.332]  And it sends the national media and all their fellow travelers within the media into a media frenzy trying to find non-existent links
[02:41:56.112 --> 02:41:59.034]  Between Trump and Russia.
[02:41:59.034 --> 02:42:07.020]  So I think the American people need to be reminded of the corruption of the Clintons and Podesta in that part of the world.
[02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:13.645]  This is his time in the barrel that I was referring to.
[02:42:13.645 --> 02:42:19.309]  As you saw, the President himself tweeted this several days ago, so he gets it.
[02:42:20.578 --> 02:42:24.661]  What we have is a campaign of disinformation.
[02:42:24.661 --> 02:42:43.555]  Now, as you point out, with the Russian claims collapsing and no evidence or proof that would ever hold up in a court of law, it becomes clear that their plan to wiretap, in essence, to put the president or a candidate for president
[02:42:44.258 --> 02:42:59.375]  Under surveillance and then a president-elect under surveillance was based on naked political motives rather than any legitimate concern about Russian infiltration into our American political system.
[02:42:59.375 --> 02:43:03.580]  This is why they have to go to Google and Facebook and pressure them.
[02:43:04.586 --> 02:43:06.188]  To carry the real news.
[02:43:23.410 --> 02:43:27.234]  To saying, oh yes, we have the secret intelligence that he's a Russian agent.
[02:43:27.234 --> 02:43:31.199]  So, they've gone back full circle to three months ago, as if we have no memory.
[02:43:31.199 --> 02:43:34.763]  And I keep going back to this Goldfish thing, but Gruber and others admit it.
[02:43:34.763 --> 02:43:39.689]  They're betting everything on the public not having memories, Roger Stone.
[02:43:40.515 --> 02:43:41.777]  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[02:43:41.777 --> 02:43:43.218]  They continue to have nothing.
[02:43:43.218 --> 02:43:44.980]  They keep changing their story.
[02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:57.055]  The New York Times wrote on January 20th that they had emails, records of financial transactions, and then on the 30th, they added to that telephone intercept transcripts, proving collusion between Trump associates
[02:43:58.327 --> 02:44:08.931]  Well, they have the former head of the Pentagon's Russia program, Assistant Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas saying everything was spied on.
[02:44:08.931 --> 02:44:11.652]  Again, but then there's nothing there.
[02:44:11.652 --> 02:44:14.673]  Now they say Nunes talking to Trump is a Russian plot.
[02:44:14.673 --> 02:44:17.354]  Now the House Intelligence Committee head can't talk to Trump.
[02:44:17.354 --> 02:44:18.255]  These people are crazy.
[02:44:19.048 --> 02:44:21.090]  No, let's be clear about this.
[02:44:21.090 --> 02:44:26.816]  Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff are desperate because Nunes is getting much too close to the truth.
[02:44:26.816 --> 02:44:28.518]  Nunes is a patriot.
[02:44:28.518 --> 02:44:29.579]  He's not an attorney.
[02:44:29.579 --> 02:44:35.226]  Isn't it crazy, though, that this is just normal courage and telling the truth, but in a Congress full of cowards, the guy's a superstar?
[02:44:36.383 --> 02:44:46.314]  Well, and the attempts to discredit him, the Daily Beast, I think the Daily Beast is actually dictated at the Democratic National Committee.
[02:44:46.314 --> 02:44:47.655]  And they just take it down over the phone.
[02:44:47.655 --> 02:44:48.136]  Well, they admit that.
[02:44:48.136 --> 02:44:48.977]  That came out in the WikiLeaks.
[02:44:49.838 --> 02:44:52.260]  I mean, this is an absurdity.
[02:44:52.260 --> 02:44:54.842]  Nunes is a hero.
[02:44:54.842 --> 02:45:04.430]  InfoWars listeners, just as I've urged the followers of Stone Cold Truth, should contact his office and commend him for standing tall in the face of this liberal assault.
[02:45:04.430 --> 02:45:05.531]  And he has stood tall.
[02:45:05.531 --> 02:45:07.392]  He's done the right thing.
[02:45:07.392 --> 02:45:10.695]  What do you make of the DNC firing every staffer they've got?
[02:45:10.695 --> 02:45:12.437]  When Trump fires 46 U.S.
[02:45:12.437 --> 02:45:13.698]  attorneys, it's the end of the world.
[02:45:13.698 --> 02:45:15.659]  Even though Clinton fired 93, totally normal.
[02:45:15.659 --> 02:45:17.581]  The Democrats are firing all their people.
[02:45:18.533 --> 02:45:21.035]  Well, at least they got fired, unlike Mark Rich.
[02:45:21.035 --> 02:45:24.877]  He took three in the back of the head.
[02:45:24.877 --> 02:45:32.702]  Uh, pardon me, uh, what's-his-name, uh, uh, Mark, the, um, the, uh, fellow who handed the documents over, not Mark Rich, but Seth Rich.
[02:45:32.702 --> 02:45:33.982]  Seth Rich, yeah.
[02:45:33.982 --> 02:45:34.423]  Seth Rich.
[02:45:34.423 --> 02:45:35.343]  Oh, his family says it's foul play.
[02:45:35.343 --> 02:45:38.905]  So, I've never been fired for being shot in the streets of D.C.
[02:45:38.905 --> 02:45:43.088]  Uh, and that, the Seth Rich crime is, as yet, unsolved.
[02:45:44.133 --> 02:45:46.674]  So everybody should email their friends, their neighbors, their co-workers.
[02:45:46.674 --> 02:45:48.915]  Tune in next hour to hear the proof.
[02:45:48.915 --> 02:45:51.416]  Which is, we know, but now it's all come out.
[02:45:51.416 --> 02:45:53.056]  Him, his brother, all of it.
[02:45:53.056 --> 02:45:55.897]  Literally on the Russian payroll.
[02:45:55.897 --> 02:45:56.958]  And we don't blame the Russians.
[02:45:56.958 --> 02:45:58.198]  That's what we do to them.
[02:45:58.198 --> 02:46:00.619]  The point is they do that for their country, we do it for ours.
[02:46:00.619 --> 02:46:02.380]  Trump has no connections to the Russians.
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:06.323]  He's just approaching it as a business deal by business deal.
[02:46:06.323 --> 02:46:09.125]  If it's better for America to have coal, so what if it hurts Russia?
[02:46:09.125 --> 02:46:15.110]  And you know, quite frankly, a lot of what he's been doing is devastating Russia, and I'm sorry for them, that's just the way it is.
[02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:19.094]  But the claim that he's this Russian agent, that's more and more getting put to bed.
[02:46:19.094 --> 02:46:22.677]  But people should tune in to see all the proof of why Podesta
[02:46:23.297 --> 02:46:28.561]  Cook this up, just like he's under investigation, the FBI, Wiener for child porn.
[02:46:28.561 --> 02:46:29.982]  We said that first in the news.
[02:46:29.982 --> 02:46:36.226]  So they get the media to focus on a pizza place, get us to cover it, so they can divert off of what they're doing in New York City.
[02:46:36.226 --> 02:46:38.708]  They're very, very good at that, aren't they?
[02:46:38.708 --> 02:46:39.689]  No, it's extraordinary.
[02:46:39.689 --> 02:46:51.277]  Look, some of the incredible investigative work that's being done regarding child sex trafficking out of Haiti, being done by people who are allied with the top Hillary operatives.
[02:46:52.707 --> 02:46:57.810]  This has not yet, I think, had the full exploration it needs to have in the media.
[02:46:57.810 --> 02:47:00.951]  Can you imagine if we had a photo of Hillary?
[02:47:00.951 --> 02:47:09.476]  As long as there isn't Infowars, as long as we have free access to the internet, the truth will always come out.
[02:47:09.476 --> 02:47:10.656]  Well, I'm excited.
[02:47:10.656 --> 02:47:14.158]  You'll go live about eight after, I'll do the first five minutes to take calls.
[02:47:14.158 --> 02:47:14.979]  Thank you, Niko.
[02:47:14.979 --> 02:47:15.899]  Niko Svirmin.
[02:47:15.899 --> 02:47:17.780]  Trump is a Chinese agent.
[02:47:17.780 --> 02:47:19.001]  Holy Toledo!
[02:47:20.262 --> 02:47:40.591]  Now, oh my gosh, they take everything we say that's true about Hillary and all my intelligence sources, and the missile secrets, and the congressional hearings, and meeting with Chinese generals in the White House, and taking money, and now they know that I've said we should come out that she's a Chinese agent, that Trump should say this, and there should be hearings, and they headed us off.
[02:47:40.591 --> 02:47:43.352]  Thomas L. Friedman, this just broke.
[02:47:43.352 --> 02:47:46.334]  Trump is a Chinese agent.
[02:47:46.334 --> 02:47:48.554]  Wow, I guess I'm gonna be one in a minute too.
[02:47:48.554 --> 02:47:49.475]  The big story everyone's,
[02:47:49.735 --> 02:47:50.415]  We lose Roger Stone?
[02:47:50.415 --> 02:47:51.656]  I think his phone just cut off.
[02:47:51.656 --> 02:47:53.477]  Yeah, Roger, your phone cut off for a minute.
[02:47:53.477 --> 02:47:56.118]  Have you heard the latest?
[02:47:56.118 --> 02:47:57.319]  Trump is now a Chinese agent?
[02:48:19.946 --> 02:48:20.607]  Yeah, we lost him.
[02:48:20.607 --> 02:48:21.609]  He's coming up in about 15 minutes.
[02:48:21.609 --> 02:48:23.793]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[02:48:23.793 --> 02:48:25.938]  Roger will be on Skype, I'm told, not phone.
[02:48:25.938 --> 02:48:27.941]  He's getting his studio set up right now.
[02:48:27.941 --> 02:48:28.222]  Okay!
[02:48:34.025 --> 02:48:41.087]  The Chinese Communist President two months ago in Davos, in Switzerland, on top of a mountain, said, I will block America and Trump.
[02:48:41.087 --> 02:48:42.107]  I'm buying up Hollywood.
[02:48:42.107 --> 02:48:43.388]  They were like, oh, we love you.
[02:48:43.388 --> 02:48:44.368]  Oh, please help.
[02:48:44.368 --> 02:48:46.729]  Please help destroy, defeat the Americans.
[02:48:46.729 --> 02:48:48.089]  That's how sold out our elite are.
[02:48:48.089 --> 02:48:50.450]  They literally go, defeat the Americans.
[02:48:50.450 --> 02:48:51.850]  They don't even identify.
[02:48:51.850 --> 02:48:54.531]  You understand, this isn't rhetoric.
[02:48:54.531 --> 02:48:55.351]  They literally.
[02:48:56.298 --> 02:49:01.821]  I've shown you hundreds of articles and clips saying the Chinese Communists will save the New World Order.
[02:49:01.821 --> 02:49:08.945]  The Chinese were burning down part of Paris yesterday because one guy got killed by the cops that was a Chinese citizen in some raid.
[02:49:08.945 --> 02:49:14.228]  The Muslims out of Turkey are saying we rule you, submit or we'll burn down the entire of Europe.
[02:49:14.228 --> 02:49:15.789]  I mean this is last week and this week.
[02:49:15.789 --> 02:49:18.571]  I've entered everything we said is happening in live time.
[02:49:18.571 --> 02:49:20.652]  I can't even believe how crazy it is.
[02:49:21.661 --> 02:49:24.403]  I can't believe our response is at 10 times worse.
[02:49:24.403 --> 02:49:25.284]  I'm not a fascist.
[02:49:25.284 --> 02:49:26.265]  I don't want violence.
[02:49:26.265 --> 02:49:27.305]  They're calling for violence.
[02:49:27.305 --> 02:49:28.626]  They want COG.
[02:49:28.626 --> 02:49:29.747]  They want overthrow.
[02:49:29.747 --> 02:49:32.129]  They're communist Chinese run that oppress their own people.
[02:49:32.129 --> 02:49:33.590]  They're Islamic bullied and run.
[02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:37.993]  I guess only the Muslims and Chinese communists got the nerve to push folks around.
[02:49:37.993 --> 02:49:40.255]  Well, you're pushing the wrong people around.
[02:49:40.255 --> 02:49:48.662]  If Trump arrested 5,000 Chinese agents tomorrow and arrested the leadership of the Democratic Party that's been working with the COG to overthrow the president, I would absolutely get behind it.
[02:49:48.662 --> 02:49:50.103]  You're going to get jury trials, okay?
[02:49:51.363 --> 02:49:54.085]  Before you get your asses thrown in prison.
[02:49:54.085 --> 02:49:55.186]  But you want to arrest us?
[02:49:55.186 --> 02:49:56.387]  You want to shut us up?
[02:49:56.387 --> 02:49:58.749]  You want a death battle?
[02:49:58.749 --> 02:49:59.789]  You got one!
[02:49:59.789 --> 02:50:02.511]  Fill your hands!
[02:50:02.511 --> 02:50:05.434]  That's a lot of talk from a one-eyed fat man!
[02:50:05.434 --> 02:50:07.255]  You're gonna find out in the end, aren't ya?
[02:50:11.570 --> 02:50:12.951]  A little bit of poetry there.
[02:50:12.951 --> 02:50:14.292]  He can pick it up.
[02:50:14.292 --> 02:50:15.653]  Let's skip this break so we have more time.
[02:50:15.653 --> 02:50:16.413]  I need to do a show soon.
[02:50:16.413 --> 02:50:17.154]  I don't want to do all this.
[02:50:17.154 --> 02:50:18.435]  That's point blank.
[02:50:18.435 --> 02:50:20.777]  Let's go ahead and talk to Shane in North Carolina.
[02:50:20.777 --> 02:50:21.337]  You're on the air.
[02:50:21.337 --> 02:50:23.298]  Go ahead.
[02:50:23.298 --> 02:50:32.225]  Concerning Noam Chomsky, as an absolute gatekeeper, he basically was a red flag for me.
[02:50:32.225 --> 02:50:36.868]  Several years ago, I was kind of new to the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:50:37.552 --> 02:50:41.836]  And I came across the video where he was invited as some kind of keynote speaker.
[02:50:41.836 --> 02:50:45.939]  And he was attacking me and others at 9-11 Truth and saying it doesn't exist.
[02:50:45.939 --> 02:50:50.023]  And he was saying it was just irrelevant and it doesn't really matter who did it.
[02:50:50.023 --> 02:50:51.724]  And... Oh yeah, I forgot.
[02:50:51.724 --> 02:50:53.486]  It's irrelevant, it doesn't matter.
[02:50:53.486 --> 02:50:54.867]  Who did 9-11?
[02:50:54.867 --> 02:50:59.171]  If there was a question about the Saudis and the 28 pages, which again is just part of it, it brings it all down.
[02:50:59.171 --> 02:50:59.571]  Exactly.
[02:50:59.571 --> 02:51:00.632]  No, that's what I mean.
[02:51:00.632 --> 02:51:02.073]  I'm so sick of fake intellectuals.
[02:51:03.049 --> 02:51:10.191]  So just act like they've read the classics, or act like they've read philosophy, or act like they've read 500 books on World War II.
[02:51:10.191 --> 02:51:11.391]  They're fakes.
[02:51:11.391 --> 02:51:15.852]  That guy picks a few big words to wow a bunch of people that think he's their guru.
[02:51:15.852 --> 02:51:17.512]  Go ahead.
[02:51:17.512 --> 02:51:21.653]  James Corbett did a great piece dedicated to Noam Chomsky a couple years back.
[02:51:21.653 --> 02:51:28.935]  It was all about an hour-long piece about different examples where he's a gatekeeper, and Richard Gage called him out as being a gatekeeper.
[02:51:28.935 --> 02:51:29.435]  You know, I think
[02:51:30.413 --> 02:51:33.717]  You know, he doesn't want to implicate his buddies in the Mossad for 9-11.
[02:51:33.717 --> 02:51:36.680]  Or his elite buddies all across the board.
[02:51:36.680 --> 02:51:38.022]  I mean, he's obviously a gatekeeper.
[02:51:38.022 --> 02:51:39.504]  I mean...
[02:51:41.588 --> 02:51:42.168]  Absolutely.
[02:51:42.168 --> 02:51:43.568]  I don't want to just attack Chomsky.
[02:51:43.568 --> 02:51:48.529]  It's just some old guy with hair growing out the end of his nose, with a bunch of weirdos, like he's like Yoda.
[02:51:48.529 --> 02:51:57.051]  He sits on little stools and goes... When he's funded by the power structure, the power structure doesn't like Trump.
[02:51:57.051 --> 02:52:00.452]  Because if he has his way, their monopolies are over.
[02:52:00.452 --> 02:52:04.232]  And we're all going to be fabulously rich if we're willing to work.
[02:52:04.232 --> 02:52:06.473]  Look at how each generation gets more wealthy.
[02:52:06.473 --> 02:52:07.813]  Under globalism, that's all going to end.
[02:52:08.633 --> 02:52:11.115]  Everybody comes to America because of the free market.
[02:52:11.115 --> 02:52:11.775]  Is it perfect?
[02:52:11.775 --> 02:52:12.716]  Hell no.
[02:52:12.716 --> 02:52:13.717]  Does America have problems?
[02:52:13.717 --> 02:52:14.737]  You bet.
[02:52:14.737 --> 02:52:18.840]  But she's the sexiest lady there is.
[02:52:18.840 --> 02:52:19.340]  God bless you.
[02:52:19.340 --> 02:52:21.222]  I appreciate your call, Shane.
[02:52:21.222 --> 02:52:22.662]  God, I love this country.
[02:52:22.662 --> 02:52:26.265]  See, I used to grow up hearing how great Texas was, how great America was to my family.
[02:52:26.265 --> 02:52:29.887]  I thought it was some type of pride.
[02:52:29.887 --> 02:52:30.928]  Just some type of arrogance.
[02:52:30.928 --> 02:52:31.769]  I never liked arrogance.
[02:52:31.769 --> 02:52:32.469]  I misunderstood.
[02:52:32.469 --> 02:52:34.430]  It was more reverence.
[02:52:34.430 --> 02:52:38.193]  Because as bad as Texas and America is, God, compared to the others, it was totally different.
[02:52:40.236 --> 02:52:49.824]  And I'd hear this stuff growing up and then I read history books and it was real, like, this ancestor did this and this ancestor did that and I actually looked it up and it was like true and I was like, wow.
[02:52:49.824 --> 02:52:53.927]  And I thought, well, everybody must feel this way, right?
[02:52:53.927 --> 02:52:55.789]  Everybody feels this way.
[02:52:55.789 --> 02:53:02.194]  And that's what's so frustrating is that there's a whole birthright for everybody.
[02:53:02.194 --> 02:53:04.416]  I don't care if you're black, Hispanic, Asian, white.
[02:53:06.380 --> 02:53:10.863]  If you're my neighbors, I just want you to be into success and happy and cool and want to have a good time.
[02:53:10.863 --> 02:53:12.004]  It's what you think.
[02:53:12.004 --> 02:53:12.945]  It's what you do.
[02:53:12.945 --> 02:53:15.186]  It's not what color you are.
[02:53:15.186 --> 02:53:17.227]  That's so obvious and so fundamental.
[02:53:17.227 --> 02:53:23.632]  But you look at the left today, what they push is the complete difference to that.
[02:53:23.632 --> 02:53:26.514]  Quite frankly, being around people that just look like you gets a little old, you know?
[02:53:26.514 --> 02:53:35.240]  Let's see what they're doing is all forced.
[02:53:37.005 --> 02:53:42.008]  And it's all just lowest common denominator, a bunch of entitled scumbags trying to rule over everybody.
[02:53:42.008 --> 02:53:44.510]  It's not going to go on forever.
[02:53:44.510 --> 02:53:45.530]  All right, who's up next here?
[02:53:45.530 --> 02:53:46.871]  Sharon in Ohio.
[02:53:46.871 --> 02:53:49.773]  Sharon, you're on the air, Sharon.
[02:53:49.773 --> 02:53:51.053]  Alex.
[02:53:51.053 --> 02:53:51.894]  Welcome.
[02:53:51.894 --> 02:53:52.674]  Hi, Alex.
[02:53:52.674 --> 02:53:54.295]  Hi.
[02:53:54.295 --> 02:53:56.116]  Thank you so much for all that you do.
[02:53:56.116 --> 02:53:59.338]  And I just had a comment about a letter I received.
[02:53:59.338 --> 02:54:05.122]  The CDC is currently getting ready to do some studies to make sure all of our children
[02:54:05.635 --> 02:54:08.937]  Are getting all their vaccinations and immunizations and all that.
[02:54:08.937 --> 02:54:10.017]  Yeah, it's been in the news.
[02:54:10.017 --> 02:54:10.657]  We've covered it.
[02:54:10.657 --> 02:54:11.498]  We should cover it more.
[02:54:11.498 --> 02:54:12.739]  It's intimidation tactics.
[02:54:12.739 --> 02:54:14.279]  It's putting you in databases.
[02:54:14.279 --> 02:54:15.240]  It's bullying you.
[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:18.221]  And it's reporting you to CPS and stuff.
[02:54:18.221 --> 02:54:21.483]  So I would not talk to the CDC when they call you or come to your door.
[02:54:21.483 --> 02:54:21.723]  Go ahead.
[02:54:23.112 --> 02:54:27.178]  Oh yeah, well I just moved into this apartment, I believe this was for the first time.
[02:54:27.178 --> 02:54:39.356]  Sure, I mean if a guy, you know, with like a red sash and a white shirt with an iron cross and a black cloak at 2am knocks on your door and he's got big mesmerizing eyes and jet black hair combed back, you might not want to invite him in either.
[02:54:41.044 --> 02:54:44.546]  Well, I'm heavily armed and I can take care of myself very well.
[02:54:44.546 --> 02:54:46.507]  And besides that, I walk with the Lord.
[02:54:46.507 --> 02:54:47.908]  So I just... Exactly.
[02:54:47.908 --> 02:54:56.833]  So tell us what the loving CDC that knowingly injected black people with syphilis and nerve gas GIs and uranium testing on homeless kids.
[02:54:56.833 --> 02:55:00.414]  Tell us what they were doing at your door.
[02:55:00.414 --> 02:55:01.695]  Well, they didn't come to my door.
[02:55:01.695 --> 02:55:07.018]  I just received a letter saying they would be calling about this study they're doing.
[02:55:07.018 --> 02:55:10.440]  I was apparently chosen by random computer.
[02:55:11.468 --> 02:55:12.489]  Well, you know, they're upset.
[02:55:12.489 --> 02:55:16.832]  You know, it wasn't enough to maim my grandmother, and admittedly, no, they gave it to her with the polio shot.
[02:55:16.832 --> 02:55:21.195]  They want to make sure your kids are as brain damaged or dead as possible, but go ahead.
[02:55:39.053 --> 02:55:41.277]  I've been a natural health consultant for 30 years.
[02:55:41.277 --> 02:55:42.680]  Sure, you're being targeted.
[02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:44.443]  No one should talk to these people.
[02:55:44.443 --> 02:55:46.267]  So what's the main report?
[02:55:47.967 --> 02:55:54.412]  Well, the main thing is, is I just feel like this is a big fishing expedition and I don't have any children school age.
[02:55:54.412 --> 02:55:58.376]  I do have grandchildren and... No, they're bombing everybody with this.
[02:55:58.376 --> 02:56:01.178]  Then once they get you on the phone, then they harass you.
[02:56:01.178 --> 02:56:04.961]  Then they try to like claim it's neglect and they try to send CPS to your house.
[02:56:04.961 --> 02:56:07.003]  Don't answer the phone when the CDC calls.
[02:56:07.003 --> 02:56:10.105]  They're there to give you diseases that hurt you and your family.
[02:56:10.105 --> 02:56:10.926]  That's their admitted goal.
[02:56:12.346 --> 02:56:19.109]  Wouldn't it be ironic if what's going on with Killary is, you know, due to a vaccination, an immunization of some kind she took, you know?
[02:56:19.109 --> 02:56:23.772]  Well, the elites admit they, quote, get the clean vaccines, but those can still have adverse reactions.
[02:56:23.772 --> 02:56:29.914]  By the way, if you're a new listener, you can Google German elite take clean vaccine, or British elite or Chinese elite take clean vaccine.
[02:56:29.914 --> 02:56:31.475]  There's something to learned immunity.
[02:56:31.475 --> 02:56:34.377]  It has its own side effects, but they're putting stuff in them, folks.
[02:56:34.377 --> 02:56:36.818]  It's declassified in hundreds of cases.
[02:56:36.818 --> 02:56:38.699]  People need to know that.
[02:56:38.699 --> 02:56:40.580]  They just think you're stupid, and so they hope you don't look.
[02:56:40.580 --> 02:56:41.060]  Thank you, Sharon.
[02:56:42.816 --> 02:56:50.740]  I've got articles today about Gardasil killing more young women or paralyzing them.
[02:56:50.740 --> 02:56:54.522]  Let's go ahead and talk to Raven in North Carolina, then we'll go to Steve and Jim.
[02:56:54.522 --> 02:56:56.843]  Raven, you're on the air.
[02:56:56.843 --> 02:57:02.846]  Yeah, hey, I want to ask a question about Senator John McCain and his little cabin boy there, Lindsey Graham.
[02:57:02.846 --> 02:57:06.808]  But first, I wanted to plug real quick a YouTube video.
[02:57:06.808 --> 02:57:08.409]  It's 22 seconds long.
[02:57:09.714 --> 02:57:15.158]  People can just go to YouTube and look up Freudian Slip Massad Agent.
[02:57:15.158 --> 02:57:23.105]  And it's a Fox News 5 interview of some Homeland Security expert, but apparently some people dug into his background.
[02:57:23.105 --> 02:57:26.708]  So it's Freudian Slip Massad Agent.
[02:57:26.708 --> 02:57:28.049]  Yeah, Freudian Slip.
[02:57:28.049 --> 02:57:29.310]  Alright.
[02:57:29.310 --> 02:57:37.777]  But you know, I've noticed since the very beginning that the two main guys out there at the forefront of all this are Senator John McCain and Lindsey Graham.
[02:57:38.738 --> 02:57:46.124]  It's saying everybody's a Russian agent trying to derail the Trump presidency.
[02:57:46.124 --> 02:57:51.348]  And, you know, these two guys, I think an argument can certainly be made.
[02:57:51.348 --> 02:57:53.910]  I've long believed that they work for the Jewish Mafia.
[02:57:53.910 --> 02:58:03.438]  And, you know, they keep saying everybody that is pro-Trump, pro-America, pro-in the interest of the American people, works for Russia.
[02:58:03.438 --> 02:58:06.180]  How come nobody ever points out that they're working for the Jewish Mafia?
[02:58:07.543 --> 02:58:11.989]  Well, there is undoubtedly a Jewish Mafia and the ADL will say you're anti-Semitic.
[02:58:11.989 --> 02:58:23.082]  No, there's Italian Mafia, Irish Mafia, Jewish Mafia, Jamaican Mafia, there's Mafias, there's Dixie Mafia, and absolutely the Jewish Mafia then, if you criticize it,
[02:58:23.783 --> 02:58:26.964]  It says you're anti-semitic, but the Jewish Mafia is a very powerful mafia.
[02:58:26.964 --> 02:58:29.986]  You know, it's in the Godfather movies that are based on true stories.
[02:58:29.986 --> 02:58:31.966]  They just changed the names, absolutely.
[02:58:31.966 --> 02:58:34.227]  And the Jewish Mafia mainly feeds on Jews.
[02:58:34.227 --> 02:58:41.110]  So, like the Ringworm Sephardic Jews, they killed over 100,000 of them in radiation tests.
[02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:44.512]  So, you know, one of the biggest enemies of Jews is the Jewish Mafia.
[02:58:44.512 --> 02:58:45.932]  They worked with Hitler.
[02:58:45.932 --> 02:58:48.353]  Well, I mean, the head of the Jewish Mafia is George Soros.
[02:58:48.353 --> 02:58:49.414]  He's out to get Jews.
[02:58:50.114 --> 02:58:58.101]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[02:58:58.101 --> 02:59:04.747]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:59:04.747 --> 02:59:13.034]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:59:13.294 --> 02:59:19.163]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[02:59:19.163 --> 02:59:22.328]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:59:22.328 --> 02:59:28.077]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[02:59:28.397 --> 02:59:29.158]  It works!
[02:59:29.158 --> 02:59:37.504]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[02:59:37.504 --> 02:59:47.392]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time!
[02:59:47.392 --> 02:59:52.536]  A total 360 win!
[02:59:52.536 --> 02:59:55.158]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.192 --> 03:00:07.753]  When the hitman comes, he knows that he's been cheated.
[03:00:07.753 --> 03:00:11.315]  Yeah, he killed his own family.
[03:00:11.315 --> 03:00:13.996]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:13.996 --> 03:00:21.518]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:21.518 --> 03:00:31.362]  We've come so far identifying the globalists and the fact that they're unelected and they have bad aims, bad will towards us.
[03:00:31.362 --> 03:00:33.463]  And from here on, their defeat is certain.
[03:00:34.321 --> 03:00:37.583]  The question is, will they destroy the planet in the process?
[03:00:37.583 --> 03:00:44.228]  Well, they'll destroy the planet if they win, so... God wants us to basically just charge into war.
[03:00:44.228 --> 03:00:44.728]  Politically.
[03:00:44.728 --> 03:00:46.349]  Informationally.
[03:00:46.349 --> 03:00:52.954]  And never attack until they start the war, and then everything is an attack, isn't it?
[03:00:52.954 --> 03:00:58.278]  And then... We know that we're just gonna be stomping on a bunch of scum, but it's gotta be done.
[03:00:59.667 --> 03:01:00.547]  I hope that's not the case.
[03:01:00.547 --> 03:01:04.970]  They're the ones openly planning for war, murder of Trump, you name it.
[03:01:04.970 --> 03:01:10.132]  By the way, we have nanotech body armor exclusively developed here in America, manufactured in America.
[03:01:10.132 --> 03:01:16.935]  We also have defender body armor that is this plastic system that's been adopted by the Defense Department, that's all I'm supposed to say.
[03:01:16.935 --> 03:01:19.516]  And both systems are different, but they're both very, very powerful.
[03:01:19.516 --> 03:01:22.338]  Regardless, in a collapse situation or a barter situation,
[03:01:23.411 --> 03:01:26.895]  All these things at InfoWarsTore.com are so valuable to have.
[03:01:26.895 --> 03:01:28.396]  These are all amazing products.
[03:01:28.396 --> 03:01:29.757]  Everything we bring you is the very best.
[03:01:29.757 --> 03:01:35.463]  Whether it's reusable face filters or you name it, InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:01:35.463 --> 03:01:37.125]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:01:37.125 --> 03:01:39.447]  Okay, let's go to calls here.
[03:01:39.447 --> 03:01:41.890]  Steve in California.
[03:01:41.890 --> 03:01:44.432]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:01:44.432 --> 03:01:45.073]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:01:45.073 --> 03:01:46.334]  It's an honor to be on your show.
[03:01:46.334 --> 03:01:47.075]  Honor to talk to you.
[03:01:48.729 --> 03:01:50.370]  Let's just say we both have something in common.
[03:01:50.370 --> 03:01:55.792]  We're both movers and shakers making a difference, and both of our apparatuses are being attacked.
[03:01:55.792 --> 03:01:59.474]  I'm the author of LennonMurderTruth.com.
[03:01:59.474 --> 03:02:06.998]  I may have emailed you, you may or may not have gotten my correspondence, but LennonMurderTruth.com holds the key to the revolution.
[03:02:06.998 --> 03:02:10.219]  There is no good revolution without going through that gate first.
[03:02:10.219 --> 03:02:13.081]  Talking about John Lennon?
[03:02:13.081 --> 03:02:16.022]  Nixon and Reagan let Stephen King the horror writer kill John Lennon.
[03:02:16.022 --> 03:02:17.863]  As crazy as that sounds, it's provable.
[03:02:19.773 --> 03:02:29.558]  Alright, well listen, I mean I've talked to the Lennon family and I didn't hear anything about Stephen King, but definitely it was a setup and I can't tell you all the stuff I was told, but I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:02:33.942 --> 03:02:36.323]  I appreciate the opportunity here, first time caller.
[03:02:56.952 --> 03:03:10.740]  You know, the more I've been thinking about the way the events have been coming down here, I think that really the elite realized that Hillary was all used up and she was damaged goods, basically threw her away and let Trump, you know, hand it him the election whether he's going to win it or not.
[03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:22.687]  And this is basically I'm seeing as an opportunity for increased civil unrest to build maybe towards a new major false flag, civil war, world war, I don't know, basically some major step to gain control, you know, of this
[03:03:24.584 --> 03:03:42.695]  Well, I just can't believe that we sit here and we calmly talk about all this when they're in the most prestigious establishment mouthpieces like Atlantic Monthly saying, let's have an overthrow through COG, suspend Congress, say all Republicans are Russian agents, have a one-party dictatorship.
[03:03:43.095 --> 03:03:45.056]  I mean, they're actually pushing that.
[03:03:45.056 --> 03:03:50.781]  They have the former deputy head of the Defense Department traveling to the Pentagon promoting the violent overthrow.
[03:03:50.781 --> 03:03:52.602]  Imagine you walk in the Pentagon.
[03:03:52.602 --> 03:03:55.684]  I'm here to promote the violent overthrow.
[03:03:55.684 --> 03:03:57.906]  And then they're all over the news saying kill Trump.
[03:03:57.906 --> 03:03:59.867]  And then we say, well, what do we do if they try this?
[03:03:59.867 --> 03:04:01.588]  And I go, oh my God, Alex wants violence.
[03:04:01.588 --> 03:04:02.429]  He wants whatever.
[03:04:02.429 --> 03:04:04.651]  They're the ones trying to organize violence against us.
[03:04:04.651 --> 03:04:09.474]  And, you know, in between when they're out, I'm not spitting on memorials in D.C.
[03:04:09.474 --> 03:04:10.475]  for communist victims.
[03:04:10.475 --> 03:04:11.776]  I'm just like, God almighty.
[03:04:13.373 --> 03:04:21.219]  But they're such scum, it won't even be satisfying to defeat them, except we get them off the backs of our children.
[03:04:21.219 --> 03:04:22.140]  So that's why I don't have any fear.
[03:04:22.140 --> 03:04:24.221]  I'm just like, okay.
[03:04:24.221 --> 03:04:26.123]  But the problem is they want to start a war with Russia.
[03:04:26.123 --> 03:04:27.364]  They're like a moth to flame.
[03:04:27.364 --> 03:04:31.407]  Like the idea of thermonuclear war is so sexy to them that...
[03:04:32.759 --> 03:04:36.663]  They just might blow the planet up in some, like, you know, orgasm of pervertedness.
[03:04:36.663 --> 03:04:37.523]  I don't know.
[03:04:37.523 --> 03:04:38.644]  But, Brandon, thank you so much.
[03:04:38.644 --> 03:04:40.806]  I'm going to come back and introduce Roger Stone straight ahead.
[03:04:40.806 --> 03:04:43.149]  I'm going to go get the article red-linked.
[03:04:43.149 --> 03:04:45.651]  Because, let me tell you, it don't matter how many hours it takes.
[03:04:45.651 --> 03:04:52.177]  I'm getting that article red-linked on Infowars.com about the deep-stated Mitch plan to violently overthrow Trump.
[03:04:52.177 --> 03:04:53.698]  We're going to email that out.
[03:04:53.698 --> 03:04:55.140]  We're going to Facebook, and we're going to Twitter.
[03:04:55.140 --> 03:04:55.540]  There it is.
[03:04:55.540 --> 03:04:56.481]  It's red-linked.
[03:04:56.481 --> 03:04:57.242]  Oh, my gosh.
[03:04:57.242 --> 03:04:58.343]  It's so satisfying.
[03:05:00.137 --> 03:05:10.141]  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and New York City Council members have all fought back against Jeff Sessions' threat to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.
[03:05:10.141 --> 03:05:15.323]  This is an interesting choice to make, considering the very concept of sanctuary cities permits breaking the law.
[03:05:15.663 --> 03:05:20.247]  And all of the news stories surfacing daily regarding illegal immigrants committing violent crime.
[03:05:20.247 --> 03:05:21.849]  How about this from the Daily Caller?
[03:05:21.849 --> 03:05:25.512]  The same day these cities said they would remain sanctuary cities.
[03:05:25.512 --> 03:05:37.823]  Three Iraq refugees arrested in association with a terrorist, omitting information on refugee applications, lying about background information, and one is associated with a multiple hostage situation in an underground bunker.
[03:05:37.823 --> 03:05:40.145]  But in these cities, they would be welcome right back.
[03:05:40.325 --> 03:05:44.908]  This is an example of how partisan the anti-Trump extreme leftist liberals have become.
[03:05:44.908 --> 03:05:48.490]  They've abandoned all logic, common sense, and even the rule of law.
[03:05:48.490 --> 03:05:56.775]  If this is going on in a city near you, I would either get out or call your local leaders to let them know if they stand for this, they no longer have your vote.
[03:05:56.775 --> 03:05:59.197]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:06:00.543 --> 03:06:02.124]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.124 --> 03:06:08.028]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:06:08.028 --> 03:06:10.570]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:06:10.570 --> 03:06:16.374]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:06:16.374 --> 03:06:22.078]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:06:22.498 --> 03:06:25.459]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:06:25.459 --> 03:06:31.021]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:06:31.021 --> 03:06:38.063]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:06:38.063 --> 03:06:42.604]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[03:06:42.884 --> 03:06:46.187]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[03:06:46.187 --> 03:06:48.269]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[03:06:48.269 --> 03:06:53.995]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.

[03:06:56.437 --> 03:06:58.119]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[03:07:00.060 --> 03:07:02.361]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:07:02.361 --> 03:07:03.921]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[03:07:07.822 --> 03:07:15.765]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[03:07:15.765 --> 03:07:20.726]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:07:20.726 --> 03:07:26.188]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[03:07:26.528 --> 03:07:34.312]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[03:07:34.312 --> 03:07:39.034]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[03:07:39.034 --> 03:07:47.838]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:07:48.038 --> 03:07:51.602]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[03:08:14.310 --> 03:08:19.174]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:08:19.174 --> 03:08:27.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:35.606]  It's so disgusting when you see Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook curled up to every authoritarian scam he can find.
[03:08:35.606 --> 03:08:43.252]  Openly working with the Pakistani government to arrest and behead people that criticize Islam in any way.
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:51.881]  Facebook helps Pakistan identify critics of Islam.
[03:08:51.881 --> 03:08:55.842]  That's Facebook, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:55.842 --> 03:08:57.743]  Now, Roger Stone's about to take over.
[03:08:57.743 --> 03:09:00.043]  He's got a big live presentation.
[03:09:00.043 --> 03:09:01.963]  I just saw a Democratic congressman.
[03:09:01.963 --> 03:09:02.964]  Another press conference.
[03:09:02.964 --> 03:09:04.864]  This is devastating intel.
[03:09:04.864 --> 03:09:09.625]  They've got communiques, intercepts of Trump being a Russian spy, basically.
[03:09:09.625 --> 03:09:10.725]  But first, they said that
[03:09:10.865 --> 03:09:11.445]  We're good to go.
[03:09:35.302 --> 03:09:37.865]  The breakdown is on Infowars.com.
[03:09:37.865 --> 03:09:46.654]  Democrats in the deep state admit plan to violently overthrow Trump, have a six-month suspension of Congress, and they're saying all Republicans are suspect.
[03:09:47.546 --> 03:09:49.367]  Maybe they're not even allowed to be in government now.
[03:09:49.367 --> 03:09:56.232]  That's their answer to 900 House seats for the Republicans and a whole bunch of governorships and winning the House and Senate and about to take over the Supreme Court.
[03:09:56.232 --> 03:10:02.556]  Just, oh, you're all illegitimate, the bureaucracy and MSM, the opposition party.
[03:10:02.556 --> 03:10:10.621]  We're deciding you're all Russian agents while Podesta is literally, and his brother, has the Russkies' arm up their derrieres.
[03:10:11.341 --> 03:10:12.502]  For lack of a better term.
[03:10:12.502 --> 03:10:19.264]  So, Roger Stone, I gotta tell ya, this is quite a time to be alive right now.
[03:10:19.264 --> 03:10:23.245]  And I know we're winning, I know that people are waking up.
[03:10:23.245 --> 03:10:30.528]  Culturally, the Brexit's happening, nationalism's exploding, prosperity, capitalism, hey, better than the Soviet Union, better than Venezuela.
[03:10:30.528 --> 03:10:31.568]  But they don't care.
[03:10:31.568 --> 03:10:33.809]  They seem like, they call it a death battle.
[03:10:34.349 --> 03:10:35.690]  They're in a death battle with us.
[03:10:35.690 --> 03:10:43.973]  So what do you make of, and I hope you'll help me get the word out, that they're in Atlantic Monthly saying what I predicted they would do, because they're using COG.
[03:10:43.973 --> 03:10:46.134]  I have my sources, CIA, you name it.
[03:10:46.134 --> 03:10:51.056]  They're actually doing head counts right now and trying to see who will try to do an armed assault on the president.
[03:10:51.056 --> 03:10:53.737]  You know, they're not going to want him to come out of this alive.
[03:10:53.737 --> 03:10:57.219]  I know we privately talked about this at dinner before he was even elected.
[03:10:57.839 --> 03:10:58.959]  That Trump's fully aware of it.
[03:10:58.959 --> 03:11:04.940]  Is it time to reveal that Trump's been aware the whole time and obviously surrounding himself with generals?
[03:11:04.940 --> 03:11:05.921]  He's not stupid.
[03:11:05.921 --> 03:11:07.441]  And don't say that in bravado.
[03:11:07.441 --> 03:11:13.922]  I do it in the hope the leftists don't, we're not trying to trick them into an attempted coup so we can like roll them all up.
[03:11:13.922 --> 03:11:15.183]  We want them to stop.
[03:11:15.183 --> 03:11:21.444]  They can even keep their stolen money, you know, like, you know, Napoleon going to Alba, but they've got to stop.
[03:11:21.444 --> 03:11:21.964]  Roger Stone.
[03:11:23.457 --> 03:11:25.017]  Alex, I think you're exactly right.
[03:11:25.017 --> 03:11:28.318]  I think we have the maggots on the run.
[03:11:28.318 --> 03:11:37.080]  You know, my mother once told me that if you wanted to disperse a group of cockroaches, that you needed to cast light on them, and that is exactly what's happened.
[03:11:37.080 --> 03:11:44.782]  And the plan you talk about is a result of the hysteria, because they have figured out
[03:11:45.542 --> 03:11:54.884]  That we now understand that the entire Russian collusion with Trump argument is a confection.
[03:11:54.884 --> 03:11:59.145]  It is a scandal with no evidence whatsoever.
[03:11:59.145 --> 03:12:12.387]  But it was used as the rationale, as the justification for spying Watergate style on first candidate Trump and then President-elect Trump.
[03:12:13.047 --> 03:12:37.446]  So as the Russian meme collapses for lack of evidence, they now realize that not only are their naked political motives exposed, but they have serious legal liability in both wiretapping, or I should say surveilling the president, and then the way they shared that quote-unquote intelligence.
[03:12:38.126 --> 03:12:52.234]  That is why the Democrats, including Chuck Schumer, this charlatan Adam Schiff, are desperately trying to shut down the investigation by Chairman Devin Nunes.
[03:12:52.234 --> 03:12:55.716]  The chairman is getting much too close to the truth, Alex!
[03:12:55.716 --> 03:13:03.060]  He is going to expose that they lied about having our president under surveillance for political reasons.
[03:13:03.060 --> 03:13:06.942]  This is a bigger, broader scandal than Watergate.
[03:13:07.102 --> 03:13:13.905]  And what do you make of the former, and I want to bring obviously Dr. Corsi in here, Infowars.com, DC Bureau Chief, he's setting up.
[03:13:13.905 --> 03:13:28.772]  We have Secretary of Defense, Assistant Secretary of Defense, Evelyn Farkas under Obama, who headed the Russian program, she's a big Russia phob, saying what we already knew from the news, that they were spying on Trump, the problem is no evidence was found.
[03:13:28.772 --> 03:13:34.894]  So now they've gone from denying that they were spying, back to, oh yes we spied, we have evidence, as if we have no memory.
[03:13:34.894 --> 03:13:36.295]  This is simply astounding.
[03:13:37.196 --> 03:13:45.279]  Well, and their bluff has been called in the Senate Intelligence Committee and in the House Intelligence Committee.
[03:13:45.279 --> 03:13:50.141]  Paul Manafort and I, I also read this fellow Carter Page, I'm ready to testify!
[03:13:50.141 --> 03:13:52.242]  Could we do it tomorrow, please?
[03:13:52.242 --> 03:14:01.145]  And how about doing it in public, so we can deflate this entire Russian collusion myth
[03:14:02.226 --> 03:14:19.058]  A clever invention of John Podesta, I must admit, because it distracted all of us from his business dealings and the Clintons' business dealings with Putin, and sent us on a wild goose chase to try to find non-existent ties between Trump and the Russians.
[03:14:19.058 --> 03:14:22.261]  And by the way, we don't put a confidence act in here.
[03:14:22.261 --> 03:14:25.063]  When we thought Trump might lose, we admitted it, we knew he was winning, we'd say it.
[03:14:25.063 --> 03:14:27.625]  I mean, we really are putting out what we truly believe from our research.
[03:14:28.445 --> 03:14:29.767]  They're in desperate straits.
[03:14:29.767 --> 03:14:31.068]  I mean, they've been totally caught.
[03:14:31.068 --> 03:14:32.289]  Trump has outmaneuvered them.
[03:14:32.289 --> 03:14:36.294]  They released secret info, lied about what was in it, got caught doing it.
[03:14:36.294 --> 03:14:39.417]  Now they're back saying, we have the evidence.
[03:14:39.417 --> 03:14:42.521]  I mean, they must think their constituents are the biggest morons on earth.
[03:14:42.521 --> 03:14:44.703]  Let's bring in Dr. Corsi to get his take on this.
[03:14:44.703 --> 03:14:47.246]  I'm going to turn it over to you right now, Roger Stone, just briefly.
[03:14:48.027 --> 03:14:49.188]  We're under attack.
[03:14:49.188 --> 03:14:50.549]  They're trying for us to be shut down.
[03:14:50.549 --> 03:14:51.811]  The Democratic Party is.
[03:14:51.811 --> 03:14:53.692]  They're writing lies about us all over the news.
[03:14:53.692 --> 03:14:54.813]  Disinformation.
[03:14:54.813 --> 03:15:01.099]  We need your hopes, your prayers, but also share the links to Infowars.com, the articles, the videos.
[03:15:01.099 --> 03:15:02.020]  That's the real power.
[03:15:02.020 --> 03:15:02.781]  They're trying to censor us.
[03:15:02.781 --> 03:15:03.481]  They're trying to block us.
[03:15:03.481 --> 03:15:05.163]  They're panicking because it's not working.
[03:15:05.163 --> 03:15:05.803]  But every day,
[03:15:06.747 --> 03:15:07.147]  is a war.
[03:15:29.910 --> 03:15:34.919]  The panic by the globalists and the leftists and the Republican establishment.
[03:15:34.919 --> 03:15:36.542]  But still, let's not be overconfident.
[03:15:36.542 --> 03:15:38.907]  We're winning, but they're cornered rats.
[03:15:38.907 --> 03:15:40.630]  Back to Roger Stone and Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[03:15:40.630 --> 03:15:41.351]  Go ahead, take over.
[03:15:41.351 --> 03:15:41.592]  I'm done.
[03:15:42.815 --> 03:15:44.876]  Alex, I couldn't agree more.
[03:15:44.876 --> 03:15:48.576]  Look, this is command central in the coming revolution.
[03:15:48.576 --> 03:15:51.777]  InfoWars is a beacon and we need your support.
[03:15:51.777 --> 03:15:56.138]  So please go to the InfoWars store and buy these excellent products.
[03:15:56.138 --> 03:16:04.420]  They help arm us, they help fund us, so that we can break through the mainstream media blackout on the truth.
[03:16:05.460 --> 03:16:30.486]  I asked Dr. Jerry Corsi to join us today, not only because I think that he is perhaps the finest investigative reporter working in Washington today, he's also, full disclosure, a close friend, but because he is the one who did seminal work on the activities of John and Tony Podesta, and the Clinton Foundation, and Bill and Hillary, and the other
[03:16:33.051 --> 03:16:39.373]  And by the way, I'm going to skip this break so you have more time, but I've got to just add the caveat.
[03:16:39.373 --> 03:16:48.515]  Thomas Friedman has written a tongue-in-cheek piece, but that's how it always starts, saying Trump is a Chinese agent because Trump's exposing the real threat to our sovereignty and the infiltration.
[03:16:48.515 --> 03:16:51.636]  Now they're saying he's a Chinese agent in the New York Times.
[03:16:51.636 --> 03:16:52.676]  We should probably add that in.
[03:16:52.676 --> 03:16:58.057]  So they're taking all our talking points that Trump's accurately putting out that are dead on.
[03:16:58.057 --> 03:17:00.018]  They're now inverting it in desperation.
[03:17:00.018 --> 03:17:00.578]  So sorry, go ahead.
[03:17:01.238 --> 03:17:02.420]  No, you're exactly right, Alex.
[03:17:02.420 --> 03:17:07.946]  Last week they were saying that you and InfoWars are funded by the Russians.
[03:17:07.946 --> 03:17:11.310]  So now you're a Russian agent as well.
[03:17:11.310 --> 03:17:13.733]  This is the new McCarthyism.
[03:17:13.733 --> 03:17:17.738]  Anyone who isn't for nuclear war over Syria
[03:17:18.539 --> 03:17:23.662]  Is a treasonous wrath in line with Putin.
[03:17:23.662 --> 03:17:28.964]  We don't want doddering loons like Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi starting a nuclear war.
[03:17:28.964 --> 03:17:32.066]  We love our kids, in your case grandkids, so we're bad.
[03:17:32.066 --> 03:17:34.667]  Dr. Corsi, your breakdown on this.
[03:17:34.667 --> 03:17:37.249]  Well, I think that you're both exactly right.
[03:17:37.249 --> 03:17:41.631]  First of all, the truth is that the money connections
[03:17:42.455 --> 03:17:46.776]  I've always been between Putin and the Democrats.
[03:17:46.776 --> 03:17:51.417]  Hillary was funded by Putin, and pedestal-wise, very extensively.
[03:17:51.417 --> 03:17:54.197]  We've demonstrated that in any number of articles.
[03:17:54.197 --> 03:17:59.058]  It's been reaffirmed by Peter Schweitzer and the Government Accountability Institute.
[03:17:59.058 --> 03:17:59.878]  We just go through it.
[03:17:59.878 --> 03:18:09.160]  You start with Hillary's decision in working with Frank Joustrop in Canada, when they ultimately made this decision to get 20% of the U.S.
[03:18:09.160 --> 03:18:11.680]  uranium in the hands of Russia.
[03:18:12.635 --> 03:18:15.878]  And from that flowed all kinds of contributions to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:18:15.878 --> 03:18:20.442]  The Clinton Foundation's still never been investigated.
[03:18:20.442 --> 03:18:30.771]  I've demonstrated in my book, Partners in Crime, you've got Charles Ortel, who's been at it for two years, showing the Clinton Foundation is nothing but a criminal organization.
[03:18:30.771 --> 03:18:31.552]  It's a scheme.
[03:18:31.552 --> 03:18:32.273]  It's a fraud.
[03:18:32.273 --> 03:18:33.734]  It's not a charity.
[03:18:33.734 --> 03:18:35.696]  Less than 5% in most cases of the money
[03:18:37.443 --> 03:18:42.148]  Clinton Foundation receives actually goes in a charitable purpose.
[03:18:42.148 --> 03:18:51.117]  Then Podesta, the ties with Podesta, if you start with Hillary Clinton and Podesta and the reset,
[03:18:51.918 --> 03:18:59.106]  Under the Obama administration, you realize what you uncover is that Hillary and Podesta were selling U.S.
[03:18:59.106 --> 03:19:05.614]  technology, technology transfer to Russia, and Russia was paying them both handsomely.
[03:19:05.614 --> 03:19:09.698]  The Clintons have pass-through accounts, which is, you know, what criminals set up.
[03:19:09.698 --> 03:19:11.020]  They've never been investigated.
[03:19:12.016 --> 03:19:26.589]  And this whole idea is ludicrous to think that Donald Trump is going to be investigated for ties with Russia when a criminal, Bechselberg, billionaire criminal in Russia, just about owned John Podesta.
[03:19:27.322 --> 03:19:32.545]  Up with $35 million into foundation groups that Podesta was running.
[03:19:32.545 --> 03:19:41.070]  We've got Podesta stock in phony corporations that were set up in the Netherlands and the Cayman Islands.
[03:19:41.070 --> 03:19:42.851]  The whole Russiagate connection.
[03:19:43.511 --> 03:19:55.989]  Really goes with the fact that what Hillary and Podesta were desperately concerned about, especially even before the WikiLeaks, Roger and I were working on this way before the WikiLeaks ever came out.
[03:19:55.989 --> 03:19:58.793]  I remember you guys were on writing articles over a year and a half ago.
[03:19:59.153 --> 03:20:01.234]  So they know we've got a Russia problem, what do we do?
[03:20:01.234 --> 03:20:03.035]  We project it onto Trump.
[03:20:03.035 --> 03:20:04.215]  He wants peace.
[03:20:04.215 --> 03:20:05.796]  He wants to block radicalism with Russia.
[03:20:05.796 --> 03:20:08.417]  We just have the media say he's a Russian agent.
[03:20:08.417 --> 03:20:20.043]  That way it distracts off us and bare minimum, we can never have detente and a peace that's good and maybe even better, we just take over the whole government saying they're all Russkies.
[03:20:20.043 --> 03:20:23.984]  If we take a hard look at it, just one more point.
[03:20:25.826 --> 03:20:26.407]  I don't think so.
[03:20:43.558 --> 03:20:48.265]  Look, it's all total projection.
[03:20:48.265 --> 03:20:50.609]  So where is it going as the narrative collapses?
[03:20:50.609 --> 03:20:52.292]  Because Dr. Corsi, you're great.
[03:20:52.292 --> 03:20:53.213]  Stone, you're great.
[03:20:53.213 --> 03:20:55.237]  I mean, the point is, this is important.
[03:20:55.237 --> 03:20:57.540]  We now have won the debate, so where do they go next?
[03:20:58.305 --> 03:21:00.867]  Well, Alex, I'm not sure... Go ahead, Roger.
[03:21:00.867 --> 03:21:07.511]  I'm not sure we have... I'm not sure, unfortunately, that we have completely won the debate.
[03:21:07.511 --> 03:21:12.194]  I think there are many people in denial about what the Podestas have done here.
[03:21:12.194 --> 03:21:19.639]  The key thing to remember is, because Podesta hid his interest and didn't properly report it as required by law,
[03:21:20.580 --> 03:21:27.181]  He is now blackmailable by the Putin administration or the Putin regime.
[03:21:27.181 --> 03:21:37.983]  Given the fact that, as Dr. Corsi points out, in the so-called reset, they bludgeoned technology transfers out of Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[03:21:37.983 --> 03:21:43.824]  They let him venture into Korea and maraud in Ukraine, did nothing.
[03:21:43.824 --> 03:21:46.845]  They allowed the Russian military in Syria
[03:21:47.265 --> 03:21:58.128]  Still did nothing and now they come along and tell us Manafort and Stone and Trump were in Putin's pocket and it's time to get tough on Putin.
[03:21:58.128 --> 03:22:05.330]  So we must give the people a refresher about the Clinton's corruption and the fact that when I wrote
[03:22:05.970 --> 03:22:08.673]  Podesta's time in the peril will come.
[03:22:08.673 --> 03:22:18.443]  We were referring to this enormous body of corruption, which thanks to Dr. Corsi and other fine journalists, did become a matter of public record.
[03:22:18.443 --> 03:22:25.931]  This is what they were hiding and this was the motivation for the fake Russian collusion claim.
[03:22:25.931 --> 03:22:26.532]  Dr. Corsi?
[03:22:27.358 --> 03:22:35.965]  Well, in fact, Roger and I have been working starting really in July and August last year on these Podesta connections.
[03:22:35.965 --> 03:22:39.168]  I started writing some articles, started researching it.
[03:22:39.168 --> 03:22:47.395]  We had Peter Schweitzer's report from Russia with money, which was very important in revealing a lot of these connections.
[03:22:47.395 --> 03:22:52.739]  I started writing for Roger a very detailed memo that was dated August 31st.
[03:22:53.980 --> 03:23:01.952]  And that was, in fact, when Roger did tweet saying, you know, some things are going to come out on Podesta.
[03:23:01.952 --> 03:23:03.534]  He's going to basically get his.
[03:23:03.534 --> 03:23:07.900]  That was in relationship to what he knew I was developing.
[03:23:07.900 --> 03:23:09.583]  We were both going to write articles on.
[03:23:10.223 --> 03:23:17.925]  And in fact, Roger and I wrote articles on the Podesta corruption, money to the Clintons from Russia, almost at the same time.
[03:23:17.925 --> 03:23:22.406]  Our articles came out right after my August 31 memo.
[03:23:22.406 --> 03:23:30.128]  In September, we were both publishing on this subject, and it had nothing to do with the WikiLeaks, which didn't really come out until October.
[03:23:31.389 --> 03:23:35.477]  So the Democrats, you know, being manipulated by the Chinese and the Russians is well documented.
[03:23:35.477 --> 03:23:40.145]  The point is, the listeners all know, they listen, you guys are informed, they understand that.
[03:23:40.145 --> 03:23:41.367]  This is established.
[03:23:41.367 --> 03:23:42.690]  Where do they go from here though?
[03:23:44.874 --> 03:23:47.076]  Go ahead, Roger.
[03:23:47.076 --> 03:23:48.017]  You take it first.
[03:23:48.017 --> 03:24:02.008]  Well, the next big fight is over the House Intelligence Committee hearings because this is the only place where these matters can be openly... And I love how they attack us all by name and now say I'm under criminal investigation being directed by the Russians.
[03:24:02.008 --> 03:24:03.169]  What the hell?
[03:24:03.169 --> 03:24:04.751]  I mean, I should be in the Senate.
[03:24:04.751 --> 03:24:06.692]  I want to go in there and shoo their ass.
[03:24:06.692 --> 03:24:09.475]  I want to go before the House and say, what the hell is your problem?
[03:24:09.975 --> 03:24:14.398]  Well, look, here's some breaking news right here at InfoWars.com.
[03:24:14.398 --> 03:24:26.348]  I have learned that Senator John McCain met privately with Oleg Deripaska, the billionaire oligarch who has been connected to Paul Manafort.
[03:24:26.348 --> 03:24:38.157]  And I'm told that the reason for this meeting was to solicit funds to assist his presidential campaign through a non-profit that can take foreign money.
[03:24:38.157 --> 03:24:39.438]  Wow, so more projection!
[03:24:39.958 --> 03:24:49.925]  Senator McCain must come before the Senate and explain what he was doing in this secret meeting with one of Putin's closest allies, Oleg Deripaska.
[03:24:49.925 --> 03:24:51.326]  There's your headline.
[03:24:51.326 --> 03:24:53.567]  Let's take that to the very start of this interview and put it on YouTube.
[03:24:53.567 --> 03:24:55.448]  Right at the first, boom, that piece.
[03:24:55.448 --> 03:24:56.669]  John McCain breaking.
[03:24:56.669 --> 03:25:01.192]  John McCain met secretly with Putin's right-hand man.
[03:25:01.192 --> 03:25:03.274]  Or McCain caught working for Russia.
[03:25:04.710 --> 03:25:07.491]  So he needs to clear the air on this.
[03:25:07.491 --> 03:25:15.295]  I mean, I am very upset to learn that he was colluding with a known agent of Putin.
[03:25:15.295 --> 03:25:19.957]  Let's go back to Corsi and then back to you, then I'm going to get out of here, but this is a great discussion.
[03:25:19.957 --> 03:25:30.663]  So what you're saying is, you report this again before WikiLeaks, you guys are on record, absolutely true, they've got such a Russia and China problem, that they're such sellouts to foreign powers, that they were scared of Trump coming in.
[03:25:31.792 --> 03:25:36.494]  I mean, I can't think of a single instance in the Obama administration where the Obama administration really stood up to Russia.
[03:25:55.220 --> 03:26:09.934]  Constantly there was capitulation, you know, drawing red lines in Syria, the negotiations, and doing nothing when Russia sends in the military, including the Air Force from Russia, into Syria.
[03:26:09.934 --> 03:26:14.399]  Same in Iran, very closely tied to Russia.
[03:26:14.399 --> 03:26:17.362]  John Podesta and, you know, together with
[03:26:18.242 --> 03:26:22.646]  John Kerry and the entire Obama administration, Hillary supported it too.
[03:26:22.646 --> 03:26:30.753]  They negotiated a deal with Iran that basically gave Iran a green light to develop nuclear weapons.
[03:26:30.753 --> 03:26:32.314]  It's not an enforceable agreement.
[03:26:32.314 --> 03:26:33.956]  So are you saying there's really no policy?
[03:26:33.956 --> 03:26:35.437]  We're just sold out to the highest bidder?
[03:26:36.223 --> 03:26:37.924]  Well, as it were, the Clintons.
[03:26:37.924 --> 03:26:39.244]  See, this is the problem.
[03:26:39.244 --> 03:26:42.905]  The Clintons have, this is what the Clinton Foundation was all about.
[03:26:42.905 --> 03:26:46.006]  It was not only a play-to-pay scheme.
[03:26:46.006 --> 03:26:51.608]  It was a scheme in which, in Norma, they were ripping- Sure, so Trump shouldn't be on his heels because they're calling him all these names.
[03:26:51.608 --> 03:26:54.609]  Shouldn't Session already be beginning the criminal investigation?
[03:26:54.609 --> 03:26:55.689]  Isn't it time for offense?
[03:26:56.479 --> 03:27:13.952]  Well, in fact, I thought that was encouraging to see Donald Trump over the weekend beginning to tweet saying, why isn't this Russian investigation, including the uranium deal with Hillary, why isn't it including the Jolie stock that Podesta got from Russia?
[03:27:13.952 --> 03:27:22.038]  Or his involvement with Max Selber, the billionaire criminal in Russia, very tightly tied to Putin,
[03:27:22.558 --> 03:27:25.863]  And how about all the deals they were making that we now have disclosed?
[03:27:25.863 --> 03:27:26.884]  Roger and I were starting.
[03:27:26.884 --> 03:27:29.027]  We published both in October.
[03:27:29.027 --> 03:27:31.310]  My article started October 6th.
[03:27:31.310 --> 03:27:33.673]  Roger started October 13th.
[03:27:33.673 --> 03:27:39.942]  From the research we were doing, much of it was based on the report from Russia with money.
[03:27:40.522 --> 03:27:42.323]  That Peter Schweitzer did.
[03:27:42.323 --> 03:27:43.283]  Excellent report.
[03:27:43.283 --> 03:27:47.165]  Again, Google even changed, by the way, the link to that.
[03:27:47.165 --> 03:27:55.848]  I had to get in touch with Roger, you know, with Roger and then with Peter Schweitzer and say, Peter, you know, Google is not even linking to your report any longer from Russia to love.
[03:27:55.848 --> 03:28:03.831]  They had to fix that with the Government Accountability Institute asking, basically checking why the Google link no longer worked.
[03:28:03.991 --> 03:28:09.034]  Now we've got the Democrats in live time manipulating Google and all this new censorship coming in.
[03:28:09.034 --> 03:28:10.815]  It's an amazing time to be alive right now.
[03:28:10.815 --> 03:28:17.318]  I'm going to go, but I want to hear what you guys have to say, obviously, about how Trump's doing, where you see him going now, you know, 70 days in.
[03:28:17.318 --> 03:28:20.480]  I think today's like day 70, but amazing.
[03:28:20.480 --> 03:28:21.921]  So, you know, thanks for letting me pop in.
[03:28:23.960 --> 03:28:27.524]  Alex, thanks for letting us have the opportunity here.
[03:28:27.524 --> 03:28:34.150]  This is the only place that one can really get the truth about what's happening in Washington.
[03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:43.380]  The Democrats have unleashed a harsh attack on Chairman Devin Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee.
[03:28:43.380 --> 03:28:46.262]  To me, this guy is a profile in courage.
[03:28:46.883 --> 03:28:48.725]  He did exactly the right thing.
[03:28:48.725 --> 03:29:02.676]  When he learned, in fact, that the President of the United States was being illegally, or at least surreptitiously, surveilled, he took that evidence to the President.
[03:29:02.676 --> 03:29:10.462]  He knew, of course, that if he took it to the minority members of his committee, they would work to leak it and discredit it.
[03:29:11.382 --> 03:29:23.650]  They are desperate to derail this investigation because I think this is the stage on which all of their lies and fabrications can be exposed.
[03:29:23.650 --> 03:29:30.494]  We'll be back with Dr. Jerry Corsi to lay out where this is going for you here at InfoWars, coming up next.
[03:29:49.144 --> 03:29:52.154]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.154 --> 03:29:55.905]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.305 --> 03:30:08.009]  While some liberal cities are fighting for the rights of law-breaking non-citizen migrants, others are cutting funds to schools that are too white.
[03:30:08.009 --> 03:30:17.254]  Walter Reed Middle School in North Hollywood is having funds cut because their school student body is too white, and this has led to layoffs and increased class sizes.
[03:30:17.254 --> 03:30:18.615]  Think schools have issues?
[03:30:18.615 --> 03:30:20.676]  Leave it to Democrats to make it worse.
[03:30:20.676 --> 03:30:22.357]  Think about this if the tables were turned.
[03:30:22.637 --> 03:30:29.642]  If Republicans were moving funds from schools because they were too black to schools that had a more diverse student body, there would be outrage.
[03:30:29.642 --> 03:30:30.702]  And rightfully so.
[03:30:30.702 --> 03:30:36.726]  But this is what Democrats are doing while shaming anyone who makes decisions or judgments based on someone's identity.
[03:30:36.726 --> 03:30:42.570]  The Democrats make policy based on identity while shaming people who make policy based on identity.
[03:30:42.570 --> 03:30:50.355]  What do you expect in California, where they continue to elect people like Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, two mentally ill politicians?
[03:30:50.695 --> 03:31:01.708]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:01.708 --> 03:31:03.730]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:03.730 --> 03:31:05.132]  It's the air we're breathing.
[03:31:05.132 --> 03:31:06.634]  Especially for our children.
[03:31:06.634 --> 03:31:08.496]  The artificial particulates.
[03:31:08.496 --> 03:31:09.197]  The chemicals.
[03:31:09.517 --> 03:31:12.679]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:12.679 --> 03:31:21.864]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:31:21.864 --> 03:31:29.409]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:29.409 --> 03:31:37.433]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:37.433 --> 03:31:38.394]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:39.603 --> 03:31:43.548]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:43.548 --> 03:31:47.112]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:47.112 --> 03:31:53.840]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:53.840 --> 03:31:57.925]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[03:32:00.080 --> 03:32:04.262]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[03:32:04.262 --> 03:32:07.044]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[03:32:07.044 --> 03:32:08.524]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[03:32:08.524 --> 03:32:12.806]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[03:32:12.806 --> 03:32:16.208]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collected.
[03:32:16.208 --> 03:32:18.269]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[03:32:18.269 --> 03:32:19.850]  It's gonna be coming after your guns.
[03:32:19.850 --> 03:32:20.250]  Oh, yeah.
[03:32:20.250 --> 03:32:22.371]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[03:32:22.371 --> 03:32:23.012]  At all.
[03:32:23.012 --> 03:32:24.052]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[03:32:24.052 --> 03:32:27.154]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America they lost?
[03:32:27.654 --> 03:32:28.395]  We won.
[03:32:28.395 --> 03:32:30.797]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[03:32:30.797 --> 03:32:31.958]  It's time to ride, boys.
[03:32:31.958 --> 03:32:33.860]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[03:32:33.860 --> 03:32:39.947]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:32:39.947 --> 03:32:42.289]  And beef was for supper.
[03:32:42.289 --> 03:32:43.350]  Revelation.
[03:32:43.350 --> 03:32:44.892]  Dawn of global government.
[03:32:44.892 --> 03:32:46.514]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:32:46.834 --> 03:32:48.216]  DVD's now available.
[03:32:48.216 --> 03:32:52.623]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:32:52.623 --> 03:32:56.288]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:32:56.288 --> 03:32:58.631]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[03:32:58.631 --> 03:32:59.433]  Let's fix it!
[03:33:13.195 --> 03:33:20.261]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.261 --> 03:33:24.845]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:24.845 --> 03:33:28.828]  He loves the game, he has fun with it, and he's very good at it.
[03:33:28.828 --> 03:33:30.930]  I'm an agent provocateur.
[03:33:32.079 --> 03:33:33.400]  Political strategist.
[03:33:33.400 --> 03:33:35.261]  Controversial as you can get.
[03:33:35.261 --> 03:33:37.882]  An incredible capacity for treachery.
[03:33:37.882 --> 03:33:39.783]  Win-at-all-cost mentality.
[03:33:39.783 --> 03:33:44.205]  When people think of Washington corruption, they think of Roger Stone.
[03:33:44.205 --> 03:33:48.727]  Those who say I have no soul, those who say I have no principles, are losers.
[03:33:48.727 --> 03:33:51.268]  Those are bitter losers.
[03:33:51.268 --> 03:33:53.969]  There's really nobody quite like Roger Stone.
[03:33:53.969 --> 03:33:57.411]  The Nixon tattoo is really all you need to know about Roger.
[03:33:58.737 --> 03:34:02.760]  We really pioneered negative campaign advertising.
[03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:06.902]  He created the modern sleazeball lobbyist.
[03:34:06.902 --> 03:34:09.044]  Washington's been worse for it ever since.
[03:34:09.044 --> 03:34:09.924]  Stones rule.
[03:34:09.924 --> 03:34:13.567]  It is better to be infamous than never be famous at all.
[03:34:13.567 --> 03:34:15.308]  The swinger scandal happened.
[03:34:15.308 --> 03:34:17.709]  My private life is nobody's business.
[03:34:17.709 --> 03:34:19.490]  Got chased out of Washington.
[03:34:19.490 --> 03:34:22.833]  He's looking to see if he can find an angle.
[03:34:22.833 --> 03:34:24.574]  I was like a jockey looking for a horse.
[03:34:24.574 --> 03:34:26.275]  You can't win the race if you don't have a horse.
[03:34:38.489 --> 03:34:42.170]  Roger saw something that nobody else saw back in the early 80s.
[03:34:42.170 --> 03:34:46.011]  I suggested that Trump should explore a bid for the presidency.
[03:34:46.011 --> 03:34:49.692]  He created Donald Trump as a political figure.
[03:34:49.692 --> 03:34:54.033]  Have you spoken with the WikiLeaks founder?
[03:34:54.033 --> 03:34:56.213]  Roger, you can't just say that.
[03:34:56.213 --> 03:35:00.674]  You have to be outrageous to get noticed.
[03:35:00.674 --> 03:35:04.655]  America may be collapsing, but Roger Stone is determined to enjoy it.
[03:35:10.632 --> 03:35:21.642]  I revel in your hatred, because if I weren't effective, you wouldn't hate me.
[03:35:21.642 --> 03:35:27.186]  And there you have it, the upcoming Netflix Get Me Roger Stone.
[03:35:27.186 --> 03:35:35.774]  But before you can see it, I urge you to go to the Infowars.com store and get your copy of The Making of the President 2016.
[03:35:37.755 --> 03:35:40.717]  You saw Alex Jones there in the trailer.
[03:35:40.717 --> 03:35:49.243]  You can also read about the crucial breakthrough role of Infowars.com in the revolution that elected Donald Trump.
[03:35:49.243 --> 03:36:05.474]  In fact, you can read an analysis of how the entire rise of alternative media broke the backs of the mainstream media because we busted their monopoly on political information and its dissemination
[03:36:06.054 --> 03:36:07.775]  To the American people.
[03:36:07.775 --> 03:36:13.476]  That is why we have this revolution and why we need your support to continue it.
[03:36:13.476 --> 03:36:19.218]  So please go to the InfoWars.com store and get your copy today.
[03:36:19.218 --> 03:36:21.198]  There's many other fine products there.
[03:36:21.198 --> 03:36:25.160]  I'll talk about some of them later on in the programming.
[03:36:25.160 --> 03:36:33.022]  My wife really likes the Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste since she has the whitest smile of anyone I know.
[03:36:33.723 --> 03:36:36.107]  I highly commend it to you.
[03:36:36.107 --> 03:36:39.533]  Now let us go back to Dr. Corsi.
[03:36:39.533 --> 03:36:42.559]  I think we have explored the fact that
[03:36:43.462 --> 03:36:47.306]  The Podestas were in Putin's pocket.
[03:36:47.306 --> 03:37:00.517]  They had a lucrative deal with the state gas utility, a lucrative banking deal in which they were gifted stock in a phony company involved in money laundering.
[03:37:00.517 --> 03:37:03.139]  Their presence in Russia is very clear.
[03:37:03.960 --> 03:37:16.012]  And that the Russian collusion argument is a figment of John Podesta's fertile strategic imagination.
[03:37:16.012 --> 03:37:22.519]  Now, in Washington, the Russian meme has collapsed.
[03:37:24.383 --> 03:37:26.705]  And this is very key.
[03:37:26.705 --> 03:37:38.337]  We now realize that it was the rationalization, the defense, for the continued surveillance of Donald J. Trump.
[03:37:39.380 --> 03:38:05.402]  Dr. Corsi broke what should have been a page one story in every newspaper in the country, and that is that Donald Trump has been under surveillance, that he was under surveillance beginning in the end of the Bush administration, that he was under surveillance on into the Obama administration.
[03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:22.766]  And that the NSA has had a secret program, codenamed Dragnet, somebody with no imagination came up with that one, and they were tracking and recording, monitoring and recording
[03:38:23.487 --> 03:38:29.834]  The phone calls of numerous into the hundreds of prominent Americans.
[03:38:29.834 --> 03:38:33.979]  There is no reason to believe that this surveillance stopped.
[03:38:33.979 --> 03:38:39.325]  So if Trump was not under surveillance, he's one of the few Americans who wasn't.
[03:38:39.325 --> 03:38:41.688]  Dr. Corsi, this was a land.
[03:38:42.669 --> 03:38:44.090]  Just a landmark story.
[03:38:44.090 --> 03:38:54.215]  And I woke up the next morning and I said, well certainly this will be on page one of the New York Times and the Washington Post and it will lead on CNN.
[03:38:54.215 --> 03:38:55.315]  Not so.
[03:38:55.315 --> 03:38:58.497]  Tell us about this nefarious federal program.
[03:39:00.003 --> 03:39:06.229]  Well, I mean, first of all, it started, this whole NSA wiretap, it started in 2004.
[03:39:06.229 --> 03:39:07.910]  And this is a database we got.
[03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:24.685]  It came from Michael Zulu, who basically had been working, we released materials that Mike Zulu and the Chair of our PINALS office in Maricopa County had been trying to get into the federal record for years.
[03:39:24.685 --> 03:39:26.307]  The data that we had showed that
[03:39:26.947 --> 03:39:27.408]  We're good to go.
[03:39:48.309 --> 03:39:48.790]  Or Trump.
[03:39:48.790 --> 03:40:03.024]  In fact, even some of the limousine companies that Trump had used in those years, 2004 through 2009, which is the first year of the Obama administration, were all under electronic surveillance.
[03:40:03.024 --> 03:40:05.226]  And it wasn't only Donald Trump, it was Donald Trump and
[03:40:05.866 --> 03:40:11.771]  His family, his wife is in here, as well as his employees.
[03:40:11.771 --> 03:40:17.096]  They had a property manager at 69th Street in New York.
[03:40:17.096 --> 03:40:22.280]  They had his golf course managers in Florida.
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:25.143]  It just goes on and on, but it was extensive.
[03:40:26.744 --> 03:40:29.086]  It was Operation Dragnet.
[03:40:29.086 --> 03:40:39.413]  Surveillance of Trump and everybody related to Trump, and it extended into his financial records, his tax records, bank accounts, credit cards, as well as electronic surveillance.
[03:40:39.413 --> 03:40:49.140]  Donald Trump could probably go to the NSA and say, play me back my conversation from such and such a date in 2007.
[03:40:49.140 --> 03:40:50.942]  They could say there are 25 of them.
[03:40:50.942 --> 03:40:51.882]  Where do you want to start?
[03:40:51.882 --> 03:40:53.884]  They're probably still out of the mall on record.
[03:40:55.026 --> 03:41:13.568]  Yeah, I think it's important people realize that these documents grow out of a federal trial in Arizona where it was essentially proved that the government was spying on Sheriff Arpaio during a time that they were attempting to prosecute him.
[03:41:14.631 --> 03:41:19.812]  Most likely eavesdropping on conversations between the sheriff and his lawyers.
[03:41:19.812 --> 03:41:23.113]  A rather large no-no, as you know.
[03:41:23.113 --> 03:41:27.354]  The government is mortified that InfoWars broke this story.
[03:41:27.354 --> 03:41:32.775]  I stress that we have not released classified information.
[03:41:32.775 --> 03:41:39.176]  We have taken databases that were built on disclosures, confirmed by the way by a number of
[03:41:39.716 --> 03:41:48.912]  Whistleblowers within the CIA as to the authenticity and the accuracy of these matters.
[03:41:48.912 --> 03:41:51.637]  So it is bigger than Watergate.
[03:41:52.574 --> 03:41:54.575]  I mean, you were around in those days, Jerry.
[03:41:54.575 --> 03:42:12.566]  As I recall, a small band of civilians, misguided civilians, attempted to break into the Democratic National Committee and place bugs that were antiquated in an attempt to overhear the conversations of Democratic National Chairman Larry O'Brien.
[03:42:12.566 --> 03:42:16.929]  Contrast that with the use of the entire federal machinery
[03:42:18.021 --> 03:42:26.383]  In an unconstitutional way to spy on a prominent American citizen who would become president.
[03:42:26.383 --> 03:42:31.684]  It boggles the mind and the excuse or the defense.
[03:42:31.684 --> 03:42:36.645]  Well, we had to spy on Trump because he's colluding with the Russians.
[03:42:36.645 --> 03:42:42.267]  Well, that's collapsing before your very eyes this very moment.
[03:42:42.267 --> 03:42:43.547]  This explains the panic.
[03:42:44.207 --> 03:43:01.152]  In the mainstream media, the panic in the Democratic caucuses, and why Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff are desperate to derail Chairman Nunes' investigation.
[03:43:01.152 --> 03:43:12.476]  And you're going to find, look, if there was anyone that Putin wanted to win the election in 2016, it was Hillary Clinton, with her top advisor, campaign chairman John Podesta.
[03:43:13.058 --> 03:43:18.679]  Because they were the number one category, candidates, for Putin blackmail.
[03:43:18.679 --> 03:43:29.582]  With all the money that Hillary had received in the bank accounts, that money had gone through, and I've published bank account records for the Clinton Foundation, tied to Russia.
[03:43:29.582 --> 03:43:32.362]  Jennifer Podesta tied to Russia.
[03:43:32.362 --> 03:43:39.444]  I had Podesta's brother, who is a lobbyist, didn't report it right away, but for one of the criminal
[03:43:40.347 --> 03:43:41.809]  Russian banks.
[03:43:41.809 --> 03:43:47.918]  The Podestas were... Putin was all over the Hillary... Bill and Hillary Clinton Foundation.
[03:43:47.918 --> 03:43:49.661]  Putin was all over.
[03:43:49.661 --> 03:43:52.405]  Podesta and his brother owned them.
[03:43:53.024 --> 03:44:00.230]  And we're prepared, I'm sure, in Hillary 1 to produce all these records, and the Democrats are definitely afraid of that.
[03:44:00.230 --> 03:44:09.376]  They won't have Hillary be investigated as part of this Senate or House Intelligence Committee investigation, but that's where it should start.
[03:44:09.376 --> 03:44:11.018]  Putin's laughing at all this.
[03:44:11.018 --> 03:44:13.480]  I mean, you've got to get a perspective on this.
[03:44:13.480 --> 03:44:17.423]  By the way, the Democrats always change the mem, change the narrative.
[03:44:18.525 --> 03:44:26.908]  First, they knew that Roger Stone had been involved with Podesta.
[03:44:26.908 --> 03:44:29.108]  I'm sorry, with WikiLeaks.
[03:44:29.108 --> 03:44:30.109]  Well, it's ridiculous.
[03:44:30.109 --> 03:44:32.550]  First of all, the times don't work.
[03:44:32.550 --> 03:44:39.892]  You were in touch with Guccifer after Guccifer revealed all the information that he had taken.
[03:44:39.892 --> 03:44:42.033]  And by the way, why does anyone think that
[03:44:43.733 --> 03:44:46.615]  Assange would need Roger Stone to hack the desktop.
[03:44:46.615 --> 03:44:48.116]  I mean, who are you, Roger?
[03:44:48.116 --> 03:44:48.937]  Computer genius?
[03:44:48.937 --> 03:44:51.919]  You spend your evening reading computer programming books?
[03:44:51.919 --> 03:44:54.461]  Are you really a wizard at hacking?
[03:44:54.461 --> 03:44:59.205]  I mean, I don't think that Assange needed your help at all.
[03:44:59.907 --> 03:45:10.234]  More likely that these documents were walked out of the Podesta's office by someone who was upset at the treatment that Bernie Sanders had been given.
[03:45:10.234 --> 03:45:13.256]  And by the way, let's go to the real heart of the issue.
[03:45:13.256 --> 03:45:14.617]  The real problem here is that
[03:45:15.177 --> 03:45:18.759]  It wasn't the hack that destroyed Hillary.
[03:45:18.759 --> 03:45:22.782]  It was all that Podesta had written in these hacks.
[03:45:22.782 --> 03:45:40.192]  The corruption that was rampant in the Democratic Party, the stealing of the election from Bernie Sanders, the admission that Hillary is a terrible candidate, the conspiracy, including with Google, to get all their data and dump all the data on Google Clicks to use for a
[03:45:40.896 --> 03:45:43.397]  We're money raising for Hillary.
[03:45:43.397 --> 03:45:44.678]  It goes on and on.
[03:45:44.678 --> 03:45:48.300]  The corruption was at the heart, the stink was at the heart of the Democratic Party.
[03:45:48.300 --> 03:45:52.342]  And that's why the Democrats had to say, well, you know, we couldn't have lost this election.
[03:45:52.342 --> 03:45:54.363]  Somebody had to steal it from us.
[03:45:54.363 --> 03:45:55.124]  So, you know, I mean...
[03:45:56.290 --> 03:46:00.174]  Maybe, Roger, you should have been smart like Hillary Clinton and started a foundation.
[03:46:00.174 --> 03:46:04.578]  Maybe you should have sold Russia 20% of the uranium of the United States.
[03:46:04.578 --> 03:46:06.120]  Then we'd really have something to talk about.
[03:46:06.120 --> 03:46:06.961]  That's what Hillary did.
[03:46:06.961 --> 03:46:08.342]  Nobody cares.
[03:46:08.342 --> 03:46:11.805]  It's quite extraordinary.
[03:46:11.805 --> 03:46:15.749]  Yeah, you should have been like, Potesta, why didn't you get a bunch of Russian stock?
[03:46:15.749 --> 03:46:16.370]  Yeah, where's my stock?
[03:46:20.100 --> 03:46:26.946]  No, I have to, I've gone over the transcript now several times of the performance of this fellow, Adam Schiff.
[03:46:26.946 --> 03:46:32.351]  And as you may have seen, I said on ABC this weekend that I thought he was full of Schiff.
[03:46:32.351 --> 03:46:43.642]  This guy uses distortions, misrepresentations, inferences, half-truths, non-truths, to weave a tale which is all conjecture.
[03:46:44.362 --> 03:46:47.766]  I'm very disappointed, Jerry, that I haven't heard
[03:47:06.343 --> 03:47:16.272]  From the House Select Committee, because I'm anxious to testify, I will come voluntarily, and I would like to testify in public.
[03:47:16.272 --> 03:47:24.640]  Having been slimed in public, I would like to have an opportunity to respond in public.
[03:47:24.640 --> 03:47:26.742]  That's the American way.
[03:47:26.742 --> 03:47:31.626]  And as I said earlier, I'm really anxious to be called by the Senate Intelligence Committee
[03:47:32.267 --> 03:47:48.394]  Because I want to ask Senator McCain, I hope he'll sit in, having attacked me and demanded that I be questioned, about his secret meeting with Oleg Deripaska, the tycoon oligarch who is close to Putin.
[03:47:48.394 --> 03:47:53.136]  And what was it that the Senator was asking Mr. Deripaska for?
[03:47:53.136 --> 03:47:56.457]  I think the American people really need to know this.
[03:47:58.006 --> 03:48:06.618]  Also, I think, Roger, the American people have got to understand that the leaking by the Obama administration has been systematic.
[03:48:06.618 --> 03:48:10.102]  And it's been out of intelligence that they've gotten.
[03:48:10.102 --> 03:48:11.665]  Whenever they've been clearly
[03:48:12.168 --> 03:48:17.750]  I think Flynn's case is going to be, General Flynn's case is going to be the primer on this.
[03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:28.374]  When they found out that General Flynn had any ties to Turkey, which had to be found out through electronic surveillance, it wasn't being made public by General Flynn.
[03:48:28.374 --> 03:48:41.218]  The leak on that, which was a crime, the leak, is part of the Democratic operatives machine who have taken this intelligence game through electronic surveillance, aimed at their political opponents.
[03:48:41.818 --> 03:48:59.611]  And to release it in public through leaking it to willing reporters who are sitting there like lapdogs willing to, you know, bark out every day at the press conferences questions that are, you know, when did you stop beating your wife type questions about President Trump.
[03:48:59.611 --> 03:49:01.993]  There's no open mind.
[03:49:01.993 --> 03:49:09.458]  You know, first it's shown the ties between Putin and Podesta and Hillary, the money ties are extensive.
[03:49:10.342 --> 03:49:12.003]  The mainstream media does nothing to cover it.
[03:49:12.003 --> 03:49:14.764]  The Clinton Foundation is corrupt.
[03:49:14.764 --> 03:49:17.866]  It is not a foundation, but it's a criminal enterprise.
[03:49:17.866 --> 03:49:20.027]  The accounting is fraudulent.
[03:49:20.027 --> 03:49:23.589]  No one in the IRS or the FBI investigates it.
[03:49:23.589 --> 03:49:37.096]  It goes on and on to where, you know, the BEM first is, well, you know, the, this is all, it was all because WikiLeaks dropped all these emails.
[03:49:37.096 --> 03:49:37.576]  Well, fine.
[03:49:38.450 --> 03:49:41.032]  Did Wikileaks write the emails for Podesta?
[03:49:41.032 --> 03:49:47.297]  In fact, if you remember, for a while, the Democrats tried to say, these aren't the real emails, they were written, they're fake.
[03:49:47.297 --> 03:49:54.463]  Well, it turned out the emails were legitimate, and Wikileaks proved that through authenticating various of the emails.
[03:49:54.463 --> 03:50:03.530]  And the Democrats were stuck with the fact, for instance, that Donald Brazile, head of the DNC, was feeding questions to Hillary.
[03:50:03.530 --> 03:50:06.113]  The corruption's solidly on the side of the Democrats.
[03:50:06.813 --> 03:50:15.099]  And they are now running a witch hunt, which, you know, should make Joe McCarthy, tail gunner Joe, out to be rolling in his grave.
[03:50:15.099 --> 03:50:25.788]  Because here are the Democrats who, you know, since the Russian Revolution have done everything they can to support Russia, are now suddenly Russia baited.
[03:50:26.485 --> 03:50:31.109]  Because they think that they have a way to embarrass Trump.
[03:50:31.109 --> 03:50:34.393]  Well, Trump, you know, even Putin laughed at it.
[03:50:34.393 --> 03:50:36.475]  Yes, Trump brought his beauty pageant over there.
[03:50:36.475 --> 03:50:41.099]  Trump said, you know, the dossier that came out of London.
[03:50:41.099 --> 03:50:43.922]  Gary, Dr. Corsi, I'm afraid we have to end it there.
[03:50:43.922 --> 03:50:46.344]  Thank you for joining us at InfoWars.
[03:50:46.344 --> 03:50:51.509]  And thank you for your trailblazing reporting on the Clinton Podesta corruption.
[03:50:59.841 --> 03:51:02.402]  Don't become dependent on the medical system.
[03:51:02.402 --> 03:51:05.042]  Get and stay healthy naturally with XtendoVite.
[03:51:05.042 --> 03:51:09.024]  Metals in the liver cause peroxides to get dumped into the bloodstream.
[03:51:09.024 --> 03:51:19.987]  Peroxides do more damage than free radicals to the arteries, and the LDL has no protection from peroxides, causing the LDL to get stuck in the arteries, creating a potential blockage.
[03:51:20.427 --> 03:51:28.833]  Xtendivite slowly chelates the metals away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process, peroxide.
[03:51:28.833 --> 03:51:33.756]  Xtendivite's 7 herbs has a job to strengthen the organs and circulatory highway.
[03:51:33.756 --> 03:51:35.397]  Can you afford a heart attack?
[03:51:35.397 --> 03:51:40.861]  Xtendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2 month supply.

[03:51:48.426 --> 03:52:00.353]  Think about this.
[03:52:00.353 --> 03:52:12.920]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[03:52:12.920 --> 03:52:16.962]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[03:53:57.790 --> 03:53:57.875]  Yeah.
[03:54:17.423 --> 03:54:19.745]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:54:19.745 --> 03:54:30.374]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for the legendary Alex Jones, who, as you know, has only recently been exposed as an agent for the Russian state.
[03:54:30.374 --> 03:54:39.202]  That's right, folks, when you see those InfoWars.com links on Twitter and Facebook, must be the Russkies putting that stuff out.
[03:54:39.202 --> 03:54:42.985]  This is the worst form of the new McCarthyism.
[03:54:43.766 --> 03:55:04.403]  I want to remind you again that my book, The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution, has the entire inside story on the corruption of the Podestas and the Clintons in Russia and their closeness to the Putin regime.
[03:55:04.403 --> 03:55:10.928]  And it also debunks in greater detail that we could possibly do here the entire canard
[03:55:11.448 --> 03:55:20.780]  That Donald Trump or his close associates, including yours truly, were involved with the Russian state or Russian intelligence.
[03:55:20.780 --> 03:55:29.410]  We now know that this was the ruse, the excuse used to wiretap our president.
[03:55:30.391 --> 03:55:44.442]  I also received news today that a judge in New York has ordered that I must testify tomorrow in a nuisance suit by a crackpot, a gadfly, named Warren Redlich.
[03:55:44.442 --> 03:55:50.226]  Mr. Redlich has dragged this lawsuit on for almost six years.
[03:55:50.226 --> 03:55:52.488]  I went through hours of depositions.
[03:55:52.488 --> 03:55:53.809]  There is no evidence
[03:55:54.589 --> 03:55:59.594]  That I slurred him in a campaign for governor.
[03:55:59.594 --> 03:56:03.978]  His lawsuit is without merit.
[03:56:03.978 --> 03:56:20.473]  It is being heard because Redlich told the judge in response to a motion to dismiss that I confessed my crimes when he attended a book signing of mine in Boca Raton, Florida.
[03:56:20.993 --> 03:56:33.599]  The judge, of course, didn't ask if there were any witnesses or for any corroboration and obviously didn't notice that Mr. Redlich is a biased party in this proceeding.
[03:56:33.599 --> 03:56:41.342]  I have now learned that Redlich is receiving support from the Clinton machine and legal assistance.
[03:56:41.342 --> 03:56:43.303]  This, folks, is a hit!
[03:56:43.303 --> 03:56:48.125]  So, if you support me, if you want to help me, please come tomorrow at 9.30am
[03:56:50.306 --> 03:57:13.394]  To the federal, pardon me, the state courthouse at 80 Central Street in Manhattan for this show trial, for this outrage to smear me and to deflect me from my attack to defeat the globalists and expose the effort, the coup that is ongoing to bring down our president.
[03:57:13.394 --> 03:57:14.094]  There's the address.
[03:57:14.634 --> 03:57:20.297]  The New York County Supreme Court, 80 Center Street, room 418.
[03:57:20.297 --> 03:57:33.244]  Patriots, people of goodwill, those who support the Trump revolution, please join me while I expose this fraud upon the court.
[03:57:34.557 --> 03:57:43.159]  Lastly, pay close attention to the attempts by the Democrats to discredit Devin Nunes.
[03:57:43.159 --> 03:57:44.559]  He is a good man.
[03:57:44.559 --> 03:57:46.440]  He needs your prayers.
[03:57:46.440 --> 03:57:48.860]  He needs your support.
[03:57:48.860 --> 03:57:56.842]  He is on the verge of uncovering the greatest political scandal in this country since Watergate.
[03:57:57.442 --> 03:58:11.607]  It is part and parcel of the efforts that we see across the board to censor us, to silence us, and to remove our president through a coup d'etat.
[03:58:11.607 --> 03:58:17.389]  Stick with us at InfoWars and we will defeat the globalists.
[03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:18.349]  Thank you for tuning in.
[03:58:37.304 --> 03:58:37.606]  You
