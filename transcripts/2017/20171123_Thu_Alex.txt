[00:00:00.382 --> 00:00:02.123]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:02.123 --> 00:00:04.324]  Thanksgiving.
[00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:07.867]  One of the few true Americana holidays that we've got.
[00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:10.088]  Probably my favorite holiday.
[00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:13.070]  The 23rd day of November 2017.
[00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.973]  We've seen total demonization of the Italian Christopher Columbus.
[00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:21.335]  We've seen the total demonization of Thanksgiving.
[00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:25.437]  We've seen attempts to get rid of the holiday.
[00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:26.218]  To use it to
[00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:34.524]  Cast dispersions on Western civilization and Western expansion that undoubtedly was a mess.
[00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.844]  And there were crimes on all sides.
[00:00:36.844 --> 00:00:46.166]  When I say all sides, it wasn't just the settlers, or it wasn't just the troops, or it wasn't just the empires, or it wasn't just all the different native tribes.
[00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:56.008]  It was all of those different countless changing factions that played into this long before black men were colonized.
[00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.894]  North America, the Vikings certainly visited it for a thousand years before Christopher Columbus supposedly discovered it.
[00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:06.315]  That's now documented.
[00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:21.106]  But long before white men ever colonized it, all the native tribes did was run around and try to dominate and control each other and take over and kill the men and then take the women and the children.
[00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:25.286]  The same stuff that was going on in Europe for 10,000 years.
[00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:28.288]  Same stuff going on in Africa for 10,000 years.
[00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.689]  Same stuff going on everywhere in the world.
[00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.491]  Humans acted the same.
[00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:43.576]  And so, we never see big pieces being done on the bad things that the Native Americans did or the way they behaved.
[00:01:43.576 --> 00:01:47.338]  Because it's not part of the liberation theology.
[00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:51.060]  Starting in the 50s, the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment
[00:01:51.698 --> 00:02:01.998]  Created liberation theology where they thought that Jesus would have fought back and was a revolutionary and hated capitalism and was a communist.
[00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:02.539]  And so they got
[00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:10.955]  The different populations that were Christian, poor, black, Hispanic, you name it, to become liberation theologists.
[00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:12.016]  And that was just one part of it.
[00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:32.123]  But to teach that in the schools to everybody that America was bad, the founders were bad, this was an undermining of the nation-state and our ethos, where we came from, so that people of color particularly wouldn't have a idea in their head that they had a right to the American birthright, or that they'd been part
[00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:35.857]  Critical parts of this great saga.
[00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:36.557]  No.
[00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:40.659]  It's all just, you were good, but you were exploited, and the whites were bad.
[00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:52.123]  When it was way more complex, with whites that were indentured servants, and bounties, and people basically as slaves, and company stores, and sharecroppers.
[00:02:52.123 --> 00:02:55.464]  But they just continue to play on the incredible ignorance of the public.
[00:02:55.464 --> 00:03:00.726]  The last few weeks, CNN claims they've broken the news that there's slave auctions in Libya.
[00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:01.586]  Broken the news?
[00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:10.243]  In seven different Muslim countries, they sell women on top slave blocks, you know, up on a stage.
[00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:11.103]  And it's all known.
[00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:12.404]  It's Muslims doing it.
[00:03:12.404 --> 00:03:21.406]  But all these reports from CNN breaking, you know, this supposed news that we've been talking about forever and others have been documenting.
[00:03:21.406 --> 00:03:25.868]  It's about, oh, the poor migrants, the poor babies, the poor migrants.
[00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:26.928]  These are people in Africa.
[00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:36.485]  That are being kidnapped and grabbed and sold into slavery by Muslims, but somehow they turn it into quote Muslims by using the term migrant.
[00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:40.470]  That's the new definition of Muslims is a migrant, never a Muslim invader.
[00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.318]  So they take Muslims of slaving people and then turn it into the catch all word of poor little Muslims, which is migrant.
[00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.551]  So they know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:54.393]  But we're going to be covering that a lot more here during the transmission.
[00:03:54.393 --> 00:03:57.516]  But I'm proud of Thanksgiving, and I give thanks to you, the audience.
[00:03:57.516 --> 00:03:58.476]  Thanks to God.
[00:03:58.476 --> 00:03:59.297]  Thanks to my family.
[00:03:59.297 --> 00:04:01.179]  Thanks to the great crew.
[00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:03.300]  And I just want to thank you all for what you've done.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.485]  We have extended the specials from earlier in the week as we planned to do, but we have new specials that are added each day.
[00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:12.547]  And X2 is 50% off.
[00:04:12.547 --> 00:04:14.309]  Super high quality.
[00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.889]  Just absolutely
[00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.990]  Needed!
[00:04:34.904 --> 00:04:36.165]  A bunch of stuff is there.
[00:04:36.165 --> 00:04:37.486]  Biggest sales ever.
[00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:42.829]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:45.791]  Again, I want to thank you all for what you've done.
[00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:49.534]  I want to thank you all for your victory, breaking your conditioning against the Globalist.
[00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:59.160]  I want to encourage you all to keep supporting the broadcast by purchasing high-quality products at Infowarsstore.com, which is a win-win for everybody because they're high-quality and it helps fund this operation.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.381]  Thank you so much.
[00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:01.162]  I'm driving home.
[00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:06.272]  Here, about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving.
[00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:13.457]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am.
[00:05:13.457 --> 00:05:23.745]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action, and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other nations.
[00:05:24.754 --> 00:05:38.142]  Globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control society.
[00:05:39.128 --> 00:05:44.231]  And that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide, but the enemy's tracking back.
[00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:50.214]  So just, please, we should all be so thankful to God and thankful to each other for taking action.
[00:05:50.214 --> 00:05:55.237]  Also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening.
[00:05:55.237 --> 00:05:57.878]  So for myself and my family, God bless you all.
[00:05:57.878 --> 00:05:58.679]  Have a great Thanksgiving.
[00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:34.510]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:41.632]  Ladies and gentlemen, Hollywood Babylon has absolutely poisoned our country and poisoned the world.
[00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:55.782]  It has been a weaponized culture system to attack families, to attack civilization, to attack our sovereignty, and now it's in a lot of trouble imploding in on itself.
[00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:59.805]  Charles Manson is dead, part of an MKUltra mind control program.
[00:06:59.805 --> 00:07:03.967]  We're going to be talking about that more coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:03.967 --> 00:07:09.371]  Also, Google launches colossal censorship and disinformation campaign under the dead of night.
[00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:15.492]  Men's shaving company attacks toxic masculinity in new ad.
[00:07:15.492 --> 00:07:18.515]  Says being strong, being honorable, being stoic is bad.
[00:07:18.515 --> 00:07:19.796]  Stop it!
[00:07:19.796 --> 00:07:21.958]  This is the total demoralization.
[00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:27.742]  And then the big news that I'm going to cover again after our guest leaves us.
[00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:34.268]  Experts were predicting over the weekend a great crash of 2018 will start in the bond market.
[00:07:34.268 --> 00:07:39.752]  Today, the euro crashed massively with Angela Merkel's fourth term as chancellor in doubt.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.062]  And her plan to flood Europe with Islamists as U.S.
[00:07:44.062 --> 00:07:45.904]  growth forecaster on the rise.
[00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:50.347]  I've talked to top globalists on-air and off-air, former top globalists.
[00:07:50.347 --> 00:07:55.531]  And I've been in contact with other, over the years, people that are high up, billionaires, you name it.
[00:07:55.531 --> 00:08:00.454]  And they filled me in on a lot of things, saying that I was basically dead on about what was happening and who had told me.
[00:08:00.454 --> 00:08:02.056]  I could just see it.
[00:08:02.056 --> 00:08:08.000]  It really isn't in the news, but you can follow the trends and the different angles.
[00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:15.814]  The globalists made a deal with the Euro and with China to de-industrialize the U.S.
[00:08:15.814 --> 00:08:22.098]  as a political system of control and implode us and turn us into a third world country, just like they've done to South Africa.
[00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:27.551]  And Trump and others are battling that.
[00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:35.598]  And so it's not just like, hey, we're fighting to get the economy up and keep the stock market propped up as a bubble, just because that's fun, because it is unhealthy long term.
[00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.399]  But we're in a financial war now.
[00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:48.649]  We have to keep it propped up until the euro implodes, because it's a cancerous authoritarian system that is opening the borders to carry out the cultural genocide against Christians and whites.
[00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:51.552]  And again, the minorities coming in aren't even the enemy.
[00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:57.073]  It's the globalists directing it all, and they admit it.
[00:08:57.073 --> 00:09:03.677]  Now the reason this all dovetails in, is because it's a planetary plan.
[00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:20.127]  And we have Simon Roche on, who is a prominent activist and individual, who's been exposing the massive white genocide in South Africa, in Zimbabwe, in many of these other African countries,
[00:09:20.771 --> 00:09:28.836]  Where everybody's now basically starving to death at epic Weimar Republic inflation because they've driven any infrastructure out.
[00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.718]  It's just a thing of conquest.
[00:09:31.718 --> 00:09:36.662]  So South Africans hold Black Monday protests over white farmer murders.
[00:09:36.662 --> 00:09:37.883]  That's Newsweek.
[00:09:37.883 --> 00:09:41.005]  Murders of white farmers spark protests in South Africa.
[00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:42.426]  That's CBS News.
[00:09:42.426 --> 00:09:47.309]  Epidemic of South African farm murders continues as gunmen shoot elderly victims dead.
[00:09:48.027 --> 00:09:52.828]  Now, these are groups of ANC-connected black communists doing it.
[00:09:52.828 --> 00:09:55.869]  Put the whole Black Lives Matter thing, it's like international.
[00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:58.750]  And you've got a lot of other black groups saying, we don't want this, this is terrible.
[00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.431]  But look at Zimbabwe, and I'm not the expert like this gentleman.
[00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:07.513]  Zimbabwe, where you've got Robert Mugabe and all the rest of it, has basically killed all the white farmers.
[00:10:07.513 --> 00:10:08.073]  Tens of thousands.
[00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:09.233]  They're all gone.
[00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:11.174]  The few that stayed have all been killed.
[00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:27.232]  Okay, so what you've seen in Zimbabwe is now going to be South Africa, and this is directed, this is planned, and we've got an expert on to go over that information for us.
[00:10:27.232 --> 00:10:32.334]  Simon Roche is head of the Office of HQ of the world's largest non-state civil defense organization.
[00:10:33.439 --> 00:10:35.700]  And I'm probably not going to pronounce it right.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:43.803]  Sue Landers of South Africa, once an ANC activist, he now works tirelessly to prepare for impending catastrophe in the Rainbow Nation.
[00:10:43.803 --> 00:10:47.904]  Simon lives in Johannesburg and is the proud father of many children.
[00:10:47.904 --> 00:10:52.606]  And we'll probably have to see him until 40 after or so if he can because I've got to him a little bit late because this is so important to break down.
[00:10:52.606 --> 00:10:56.227]  We can also show how they first disarmed everybody and now they're able to kill them.
[00:10:57.027 --> 00:10:59.228]  And how the government basically goes along with this.
[00:10:59.228 --> 00:11:04.210]  So it's S-U-I-D-L-A-N-D-E-R-S.
[00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.192]  And folks, it is total breakdown of civilization there.
[00:11:08.192 --> 00:11:09.493]  This is happening.
[00:11:09.493 --> 00:11:12.454]  And so you're going to see the whole continent now basically collapse.
[00:11:12.454 --> 00:11:13.915]  Libya has been destroyed by the globalists.
[00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:18.237]  Now they're going to bring down South Africa using their race-based communist narrative.
[00:11:18.237 --> 00:11:20.858]  Simon Roche, you're the expert.
[00:11:20.858 --> 00:11:23.899]  So I just gave my gestalt snapshot from America.
[00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:26.100]  Was that accurate or was that inaccurate?
[00:11:27.532 --> 00:11:29.353]  No, that's just about accurate.
[00:11:29.353 --> 00:11:33.574]  For a long time, we've been predicting these things.
[00:11:33.574 --> 00:11:36.315]  We're not hidebound by doctrine, as many people are.
[00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:41.397]  You know, they're supposed to conform to the narrative of the new South African Rainbow Nation.
[00:11:41.397 --> 00:11:50.320]  Our organization, SAITLANDERS, the largest of its kind in the world, as you said, operates on facts, statistics, data, true information.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.842]  And it is very much the way that you've described.
[00:11:52.842 --> 00:12:02.789]  There's an ongoing decline in South Africa particularly, or Southern Africa, and it is indisputably driven by globalist capital forces.
[00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:06.932]  That's beyond any sort of doubt.
[00:12:06.932 --> 00:12:14.237]  We can go to your website to see examples of the carnage, the murder, the death, but for people that don't know, can you describe the forces in South Africa?
[00:12:15.948 --> 00:12:22.843]  Well, the South African political scene is dominated by the African National Congress government of Nelson Mandela fame.
[00:12:24.062 --> 00:12:46.227]  They are now challenged very heavily for their original political territory by a Leninist, Stalinist political party called the Economic Freedom Fighters, whose leader very famously in recent months has said that blacks should invade white farms with the spear in the hand.
[00:12:46.227 --> 00:12:49.608]  He's also the guy who said on the 7th of November last year that
[00:12:51.148 --> 00:12:53.990]  He's not calling for the slaughter of all whites yet.
[00:12:53.990 --> 00:13:03.895]  And as a very, very influential tribal leader in South Africa said to me, Simon, in English or European idiom, that could mean many things.
[00:13:03.895 --> 00:13:07.337]  In African idiom, that means only one thing.
[00:13:07.337 --> 00:13:14.481]  He's telling his supporters that at some point, but not now, he is going to call upon them to slaughter all of the whites.
[00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:16.863]  And they should prepare for it.
[00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:22.387]  Whether people like that or not, that's the reality that we're facing at the moment.
[00:13:22.387 --> 00:13:23.688]  And it gets worse and worse.
[00:13:23.688 --> 00:13:33.595]  You know, the African National Congress, Alex, maintains its Mkonto Wesizwe, Spear of the Nation, armed wing.
[00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:41.582]  So it's probably the only political party in the world that, besides being the governing force and having a defense force, also has its armed wing.
[00:13:41.582 --> 00:13:44.484]  And the head of the armed wing, the Mkonto Wesizwe,
[00:13:45.104 --> 00:13:57.635]  In our largest, most populous province said a few months ago that it is now time for young blacks to go to training camps in the bush in South Africa to learn to kill whites in a civil war.
[00:13:57.635 --> 00:14:10.246]  So those are the main parties, the extreme left party, the ANC and then of course there's the minor white population of about eight and a half percent and we believe that we are going to be on the receiving end of this.
[00:14:13.149 --> 00:14:42.086]  Now, for those that, again, haven't studied the different topography and the different areas, you've got the quasi-communist government before, and I guess it's just getting more and more radicalized by its far left, and I read their own plans and their own statements, and the people being murdered every day now, and the riots and the looting of the infrastructure, and it sounds just like what Antifa and Black Lives Matter and the Soros-funded groups are doing over here!
[00:14:43.852 --> 00:14:44.973]  It's very similar.
[00:14:44.973 --> 00:14:46.374]  The similarities are terrific.
[00:14:46.374 --> 00:15:03.285]  I've just spent six months in the USA, going from one end to the other, over 27,000 miles worth of driving, visiting decent, respectable, bright-eyed, fresh-faced, very nice people, to talk with them about this problem and to endeavour to raise funds because we are
[00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:16.889]  Very, very close to a crisis and we need to very urgently get whatever... We're going to talk about that, we're going to talk about your emergency, we're going to talk about your emergency plan because, again, some people are just saying, hey, you should just leave.
[00:15:16.889 --> 00:15:27.052]  Well, a lot of people, you know, can't leave, a lot of countries won't take you, but, I mean, explain what's happening there when we come back from break and the emergency plan because, as you said, already
[00:15:28.032 --> 00:15:29.993]  South Africa has one of the highest crime rates in the world.
[00:15:29.993 --> 00:15:31.173]  It's collapsing.
[00:15:31.173 --> 00:15:34.095]  The populations are just killing each other en masse.
[00:15:34.095 --> 00:15:38.116]  People believe if you rape a baby, if you have HIV, that it makes you well.
[00:15:38.116 --> 00:15:43.339]  I mean, it's just descending back into absolute barbarism.
[00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:46.400]  And I got to ask you, why not just evacuate?
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.661]  And then it's very sad.
[00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:49.561]  These folks will all just kill each other.
[00:15:49.561 --> 00:15:51.842]  For whatever reason, it's very, very sad.
[00:15:51.842 --> 00:15:52.603]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:52.603 --> 00:15:52.963]  Stay with us.

[00:18:00.553 --> 00:18:04.336]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:12.041]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:20.287]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:25.089]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:18:25.089 --> 00:18:34.913]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:38.355]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:18:38.355 --> 00:18:49.380]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.361]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[00:18:52.361 --> 00:18:55.463]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[00:18:55.463 --> 00:18:59.005]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:08.970]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of a giant time bomb.
[00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:14.973]  With populations and globalism and the New World Order's manipulation of people's minds,
[00:19:15.962 --> 00:19:17.502]  Things are getting crazy.
[00:19:17.502 --> 00:19:20.103]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[00:19:20.103 --> 00:19:22.823]  We've also got to have rear-guard actions to be prepared.
[00:19:22.823 --> 00:19:27.384]  And the number one thing, after getting right with God, is to have high-quality, storable food.
[00:19:27.384 --> 00:19:33.425]  Well, the entire line of MyPatriot Supply Foods, private label, is in full or select, is now 50% off.
[00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:37.526]  We've only done that one time before previously.
[00:19:37.526 --> 00:19:38.366]  50% off.
[00:19:38.366 --> 00:19:39.726]  You cannot beat that.
[00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:42.327]  And we're only doing that through Cyber Monday.
[00:19:42.327 --> 00:19:44.267]  So it starts today on Thanksgiving.
[00:19:44.687 --> 00:19:46.969]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:20.197 --> 00:20:24.578]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:28.400]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:37.102]  Simon Roche is the head of the office of the HQ of the world's largest non-state civil defense organization in South Africa.
[00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:49.246]  And in many other countries, once communists take over or leftists take over, they slowly isolate the whites, put them basically in controlled areas, farm ghettos, and then start exterminating them.
[00:20:50.183 --> 00:20:52.325]  That's now accelerated in South Africa.
[00:20:52.325 --> 00:20:55.006]  It's been basically complete in Zimbabwe.
[00:20:55.006 --> 00:20:56.928]  Tens of thousands of whites killed.
[00:20:56.928 --> 00:20:59.390]  The leftist media in the West celebrates it.
[00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:00.771]  They teach at major universities.
[00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:01.691]  It's good.
[00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:12.579]  And now the second most powerful party in South Africa is set to take power, openly saying they will kill every white left 8% of the population in South Africa.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.981]  Now, you can say, well, just get out of there.
[00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:18.362]  Well, a lot of Western countries won't take people out of South Africa.
[00:21:18.362 --> 00:21:23.243]  That's kind of a UN globalist thing, is they don't want whites going to nations that have whites.
[00:21:23.243 --> 00:21:29.085]  This is a globalist attack on whites, run by elite whites, in every case.
[00:21:29.085 --> 00:21:35.167]  So you have to ask yourself, flood countries with non-whites, and then say, whites get out.
[00:21:35.167 --> 00:21:37.988]  Well, you can argue, obviously, Africa, whites colonize that.
[00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:45.687]  But the issue is globalists are now reverse colonizing using third world populations to flood first world nations to drive down wages.
[00:21:46.753 --> 00:21:48.075]  And then exploit those countries.
[00:21:48.075 --> 00:21:52.679]  So, once the whites are all out of South Africa, which has already happened in other countries, it's going to fully collapse.
[00:21:52.679 --> 00:21:53.760]  That's my view on it.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:00.567]  Talk about your emergency plan, Simon, and just how dire the situation is, and tell the folks here in the U.S.
[00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:08.816]  and around the world what it's like to be there, because I know they've taken most your guns in the last decade or so, and of course now that's accelerated the white genocide.
[00:22:10.555 --> 00:22:11.436]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:11.436 --> 00:22:19.447]  The best source on this is Dr. Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch of Washington, D.C., who's written extensively about this.
[00:22:19.447 --> 00:22:23.792]  And there's nobody in the world who compares to him as an expert on genocide.
[00:22:23.792 --> 00:22:27.397]  And he said that clearly we are heading towards an open genocide.
[00:22:29.218 --> 00:22:36.365]  I think that the key thing for people to understand, Alex, is the statistics rather than the sentiment, the opinion.
[00:22:36.365 --> 00:22:48.537]  The reality is that the chances of a white farmer in South Africa being murdered on his farm are more than double the chances of a policeman in this violent society being killed.
[00:22:49.057 --> 00:22:57.602]  Now, when a man who tills the soil stands more than twice the chance of a crime fighter in a violent society dying, then you know that there's something wrong.
[00:22:57.602 --> 00:23:04.606]  The statistical likelihood of a white person being murdered by a black person in South Africa is more than 12,000% higher
[00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:13.829]  The persecution of whites in Africa is larger than persecution statistically that's been done to blacks in this country.
[00:23:13.829 --> 00:23:15.170]  By more than 12,000% that's correct.
[00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:15.530]  Continue.
[00:23:30.672 --> 00:23:34.938]  Well, our national emergency plan is an entirely peaceful plan.
[00:23:34.938 --> 00:23:37.301]  We're non-insurrectionist, non-seditionist.
[00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:38.843]  We're not here to cause trouble.
[00:23:38.843 --> 00:23:45.653]  We're here to look after innocent women, children and non-able-bodied people and the elderly.
[00:23:46.113 --> 00:24:03.553]  We're here in the event of an open civil war in this country, a race-based civil war, such as black leaders have been promising us, particularly since August of last year, when our former judge president said that we're staring a race-based civil war in the face and so on and so forth over the intervening year.
[00:24:05.093 --> 00:24:14.117]  We are here to protect ordinary people, to prepare to look after white people in the event of the civil war that we are being promised by black leaders.
[00:24:14.117 --> 00:24:16.017]  It's a national emergency plan.
[00:24:16.017 --> 00:24:18.198]  It extends over the entire country.
[00:24:18.198 --> 00:24:21.039]  It has been in place since 2006.
[00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:22.379]  We are prepared.
[00:24:22.379 --> 00:24:24.020]  And by the way, you know it's going to happen.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.921]  This is happening in how many other African countries?
[00:24:25.921 --> 00:24:32.223]  I can think of four in the last 50 years that it starts the exact same way and then all of a sudden everybody's wiped out.
[00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.911]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:36.252]  That's the way it's done.
[00:24:36.252 --> 00:24:39.414]  And the irony of it is that it's not driven by those people.
[00:24:39.414 --> 00:24:44.138]  They are driven by an ideology that's given to them by somebody else.
[00:24:44.138 --> 00:24:45.399]  And that was my next point.
[00:24:45.399 --> 00:24:47.621]  Charlie Manson just died.
[00:24:47.621 --> 00:24:50.943]  He pushed this whole kill the white thing because the university taught him.
[00:24:50.943 --> 00:24:55.426]  Why are the big banks, why are the mega-rich funding this ideology?
[00:24:55.426 --> 00:24:58.248]  Tell us what the ideology is.
[00:24:58.248 --> 00:24:59.649]  The ideology is a
[00:25:00.831 --> 00:25:06.637]  ...form of communism, but ultimately what it comes down to is an anti-European Christian tradition.
[00:25:07.483 --> 00:25:09.304]  That's fundamentally what it comes down to.
[00:25:09.304 --> 00:25:16.868]  If you see what's being done in the world today, it's being directed at Christian, conservative Europeans.
[00:25:16.868 --> 00:25:32.035]  Ultimately, we are the people, for whatever reason it may be, whether it's in North America or in Europe, who are on the receiving end of this relentless assault against our culture, traditions, religion, history, and our dignity and our pride.
[00:25:32.035 --> 00:25:33.176]  This is a consistent thing.
[00:25:34.716 --> 00:25:41.661]  Well, it's because the new global system's coming in and it wants to erase any system that won't be absorbed and that's strong.
[00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:44.324]  And that's why it's being directed by George Soros.
[00:25:44.324 --> 00:25:47.626]  He admittedly is directing a lot of the South African stuff.
[00:25:47.626 --> 00:25:56.633]  Well, Alex, you know, our leader and founder, a guy by the name of Gustav Miller, has been writing about this and talking about this for nearly 20 years.
[00:25:56.633 --> 00:26:02.758]  And for a long time, people thought that he was, you know, off his tree or however you like to put it, that he was crazy.
[00:26:03.218 --> 00:26:11.780]  But over time it's become more and more and more and more and more conspicuous and thank God for that because it validates us and we don't look like the crazies anymore.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:19.102]  Thank God for what's happening in the USA and what's happening in Europe because now we're in a position to say to people, hey, don't trust us.
[00:26:19.102 --> 00:26:20.623]  Trust your own eyes.
[00:26:20.623 --> 00:26:25.864]  Look, look, look what's being done and to whom it is being done and who is driving it in the end.
[00:26:26.656 --> 00:26:40.809]  This liberalist, post-modernist, moral relativist, humanist assault on everything that is moral absolutist, on everything that is firm and that is fixed, is now pervasive in the Western world.
[00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:42.250]  It's Jacobin-French Revolution.
[00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.112]  It's the very same ideology.
[00:26:44.112 --> 00:26:45.033]  It's never been cut.
[00:26:45.033 --> 00:26:47.115]  It's never been totally defeated.
[00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:49.217]  It just keeps moving around like a cancer.
[00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:52.346]  Yeah, it is like a cancer.
[00:26:52.346 --> 00:26:53.067]  It is.
[00:26:53.067 --> 00:26:57.312]  And at the moment, it's expressing itself something terrible in South Africa.
[00:26:57.312 --> 00:27:00.236]  The rate of rape and murder and what have you is just phenomenal.
[00:27:00.236 --> 00:27:05.161]  You know, I saw some of those papers that you had in your hand, and it said elderly couple shot whatever.
[00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:07.985]  And I couldn't help but think to myself, that's
[00:27:08.678 --> 00:27:10.220]  That's not a good example.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:30.579]  You know, with all due respect, the good examples are the elderly couple that had boiling water poured over them, or the elderly gentleman who recently got locked up in his Ford truck and trussed up, and then the truck set on fire and burned to death, or the little girl who was raped, the four-year-old girl who was raped by three men, survived it,
[00:27:31.219 --> 00:27:40.893]  And because she survived, you know, this was proven in the post-mortem autopsy, she was then bundled up in newspaper with gasoline poured over it and then set on fire.
[00:27:40.893 --> 00:27:48.523]  Or the girl who was crucified on her parents' kitchen table and then raped a three-year-old girl in this instance, the three-year-old girl raped by
[00:27:48.683 --> 00:27:51.267]  You know, it is beyond people's imagination what we're in at the moment.
[00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:21.601]  Wow, well I want to talk about how people can shine light on this because just like Genocide Watch and others, whether it's an Asian group being killed or an African group being killed or people in Latin America, I mean I'm against any of these genocides, but the UN even admits that in the last decade Christians are the number one targeted group and the targeting's doubled.
[00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:22.783]  Just like we saw the UN
[00:28:23.746 --> 00:28:28.031]  And the globalists of NATO involved in the Middle East and Syria targeting Christians.
[00:28:28.031 --> 00:28:31.015]  They will go out of their way to kill Christians.
[00:28:31.015 --> 00:28:31.876]  And it is a program.
[00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:32.557]  Look at China.
[00:28:32.557 --> 00:28:34.800]  The Christians are being killed.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.104]  But anybody else peaceful, the Buddhists are being killed.
[00:28:38.104 --> 00:28:39.386]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:39.386 --> 00:28:40.407]  And their organs taken.
[00:28:40.407 --> 00:28:41.088]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:41.088 --> 00:28:41.789]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:30:07.562 --> 00:30:08.783]  A 360 win.
[00:30:08.783 --> 00:30:15.346]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:23.289]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:30:23.289 --> 00:30:26.931]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders of
[00:30:27.051 --> 00:30:27.871]  We're good to go.
[00:30:50.757 --> 00:31:09.211]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of a giant time bomb.
[00:31:09.211 --> 00:31:17.517]  With populations and globalism and the New World Order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy.
[00:31:17.517 --> 00:31:19.479]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.843]  We've also got to have rear-guard actions to be prepared.
[00:31:22.843 --> 00:31:27.387]  The number one thing, after getting right with God, is to have high-quality, storable food.
[00:31:27.387 --> 00:31:33.433]  Well, the entire line of My Patriot Supply Foods, private-labeled as MFOR Select, is now 50% off.
[00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:36.917]  We've only done that one time before previously.
[00:31:36.917 --> 00:31:37.457]  50% off.
[00:31:37.457 --> 00:31:38.478]  You cannot beat that.
[00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:42.882]  I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding our operation by purchasing products,
[00:32:08.482 --> 00:32:08.984]  I don't know.
[00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:28.921]  We provide high quality products to make it easy to support yourself and to support us symbiotically as we try to retake this country and the planet and heal the population that's put under globalist engineering.
[00:32:28.921 --> 00:32:36.745]  That said, we're running biggest specials ever every single year during Black Friday and this year is even better than last year.
[00:32:36.745 --> 00:32:39.727]  We've got free shipping store-wide on everything.

[00:33:00.331 --> 00:33:02.953]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.309 --> 00:33:17.931]  Big Brother.
[00:33:17.931 --> 00:33:21.214]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:21.214 --> 00:33:23.796]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:23.796 --> 00:33:25.717]  You want answers?
[00:33:25.717 --> 00:33:27.639]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:35.966]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.966 --> 00:33:39.409]  Soundlanders.org.
[00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:42.092]  Simon, Rosh is our guest.
[00:33:42.913 --> 00:33:50.315]  I've got so much big breaking news after he leaves, but what he's talking about is so important I want to finish up and have him back soon.
[00:33:50.315 --> 00:33:51.275]  But we've got this breaking.
[00:33:51.275 --> 00:33:52.836]  Bezos and Deep State unite.
[00:33:52.836 --> 00:33:57.877]  Amazon launches cloud service for CIA.
[00:33:57.877 --> 00:34:00.238]  Bezos is the CIA, folks.
[00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:03.519]  Look into his dad, all of it never ends.
[00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:06.299]  And then meanwhile, Trump to LaVar Ball.
[00:34:06.299 --> 00:34:08.460]  I should have left them all in jail.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.461]  These people are, they're caught shoplifting.
[00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:12.081]  That's like 10 years in jail in China.
[00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:18.657]  Trump gets them out, China admits that the president interceded, and the family says, we don't appreciate you because you're Trump.
[00:34:18.657 --> 00:34:27.326]  I mean, it's just the entitlement and the craziness and just all the weirdness.
[00:34:27.326 --> 00:34:31.231]  It's so sad to see and then to see countries that the globalist social engineers wreck.
[00:34:31.747 --> 00:34:38.950]  They put communists in, then they extract the resources for almost nothing, and the Africans don't get it, whether they be white or black.
[00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:44.013]  Because when you've been there 300 years, like some of these folks, or longer, you know, you can call yourself an African.
[00:34:44.013 --> 00:34:45.653]  And, again, it's not all the tribes doing it.
[00:34:45.653 --> 00:34:47.054]  It's always the ones that get organized.
[00:34:47.054 --> 00:34:48.254]  And I know there's different factions.
[00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:52.456]  You've got the Zulus, and you've got all the other tribes kind of into the ANC.
[00:34:52.456 --> 00:34:52.997]  I don't live there.
[00:34:52.997 --> 00:34:53.497]  I'm not an expert.
[00:34:54.247 --> 00:34:58.929]  I know that pretty much all that's left is the farmers that are kind of like what you'd call Amish.
[00:34:58.929 --> 00:35:03.151]  In fact, a lot of them, I guess, come from Amish, from the Dutch and German derivation.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:08.494]  And I've read that, I guess, the Southlanders organization has some connections.
[00:35:08.494 --> 00:35:14.537]  Describe the background of your group, because, again, I mean, I've researched it, but there's a lot of different subgroups.
[00:35:14.537 --> 00:35:16.278]  Who are some of the different groups there in Africa?
[00:35:16.278 --> 00:35:18.079]  Who are you trying to organize together?
[00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:20.540]  Because, I mean, you're the breadbasket of much of Africa.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.181]  Everybody knows that, who studied it.
[00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:33.010]  And then it's shown once you get overthrown and just kicked off your land that you've developed that people see and want, it always goes out of cultivation and falls apart.
[00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:36.813]  So again, why are the communists pushing so hard to get you out?
[00:35:36.813 --> 00:35:41.797]  I guess because the internationalists want to bring down stability so they can exploit the population better.
[00:35:41.797 --> 00:35:42.818]  They don't want civilization.
[00:35:44.167 --> 00:35:50.951]  Well, it's that, and they're also absolutely devoted to this idea of destroying this European Christian tradition.
[00:35:50.951 --> 00:35:56.414]  Whether people like it or not, they only need to look at the evidence, not in South Africa, but around the world, of what is happening today.
[00:35:56.414 --> 00:36:04.679]  Whose culture is being undermined by abortion, pornography, and gay marriage, and what have you, in complete contradiction to the doctrines, the prevailing doctrines.
[00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:07.541]  I mean, it makes no sense no matter how you look at it.
[00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:10.263]  You can't defend this thing forever and ever and ever.
[00:36:10.263 --> 00:36:11.964]  At some point, you've got to
[00:36:12.921 --> 00:36:15.663]  Believe the very evidence that lies before you.
[00:36:15.663 --> 00:36:17.585]  Well sure, the globalists admit this plan.
[00:36:17.585 --> 00:36:30.096]  So what I'm asking you is, I mean basically the organization you're with, the groups you represent, aren't you guys, I mean basically like Amish, living in a basic Christian tradition, farming, raising your families?
[00:36:31.405 --> 00:36:34.767]  Yes, it is a very, very conservative culture.
[00:36:34.767 --> 00:37:00.605]  Of course, people have televisions and modern devices and appliances and that kind of stuff, but the fundamental cultural values of the people who I represent or who the State of London is devoted to protecting, that is to say, particularly the Afrikaner, Boer people of South Africa, also other whites, because that's how the international laws under which we are constituted legally work,
[00:37:01.205 --> 00:37:05.046]  But those Afrikaner poor people are very, very conservative.
[00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:07.846]  I'll illustrate the point to you very briefly, Alex.
[00:37:07.846 --> 00:37:24.710]  You know, we hold to a series of prophecies that said this crisis, the prophecies given a hundred years ago, will occur at a time when a man with a bloyscale cape, that is to say hair resembling a wig, will be in power in the United States.
[00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:29.231]  And he will take over the reins of power from a black man.
[00:37:30.053 --> 00:37:32.175]  And there are various other things.
[00:37:32.175 --> 00:37:33.636]  I won't go on and on and on about it.
[00:37:33.636 --> 00:37:37.538]  But the point is that we are devoted to an ancient culture.
[00:37:37.538 --> 00:37:41.961]  Well, that's intriguing though, because I want to hear about this prophecy.
[00:37:41.961 --> 00:37:46.864]  Well, this chap lived, he was born in 1864, died in 1926.
[00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:48.745]  Very pious chap.
[00:37:48.745 --> 00:37:55.630]  And he made a long series of prophecies in which he described that there would be three world wars.
[00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.391]  And he said that the third world war
[00:37:58.098 --> 00:38:08.525]  Would happen in parallel to a civil war in South Africa, a race-based civil war between the races, but ultimately driven by the globalists, which we have always said.
[00:38:08.525 --> 00:38:11.707]  Anybody who can read Afrikaans language is welcome to go on our website.
[00:38:11.707 --> 00:38:19.513]  There are hundreds of articles that make it very, very clear that we see our first enemy not as black people or not, it's not the black people.
[00:38:19.513 --> 00:38:22.555]  It is this global capitalist new world order.
[00:38:22.555 --> 00:38:23.576]  He said that
[00:38:24.979 --> 00:38:51.630]  The third world war would happen in tandem with a crisis in South Africa, and he said it would be at a time when this man, who is a stern man, who gazes sternly, has hair resembling a wig, and he takes over the reins of the USA from a black man, after the black man has confused the identity and the orientation of the United States.
[00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.951]  He said that would be
[00:38:54.583 --> 00:39:00.878]  At a time when there's a wave of black and brown skinned migrants into Europe.
[00:39:00.878 --> 00:39:02.502]  He was very, very explicit about it.
[00:39:03.044 --> 00:39:08.887]  He said, following that, there would be a global financial crisis.
[00:39:08.887 --> 00:39:21.353]  And he spoke particularly of the fact that the money in Europe would not be worth the paper, that the value of the paper would be greater than the amount of money that it denominated.
[00:39:21.353 --> 00:39:28.797]  By the way, I've read about this fellow before and forgot about it, and he actually, it's on record, he said all this, that he was listening to back then, and it was all basically coming true.
[00:39:28.797 --> 00:39:30.758]  The Euro is starting to collapse right now.
[00:39:32.279 --> 00:39:32.779]  Yeah.
[00:39:32.779 --> 00:39:41.766]  Well, he lost practically all of his credibility when he made one of his final prophecies, namely that there would be a black government in South Africa.
[00:39:41.766 --> 00:39:46.070]  Now, a hundred years ago, everybody thought that he was just playing crazy and they wrote him off.
[00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:52.595]  He said the first black ruler on the throne of South Africa would be deemed a saint by the world.
[00:39:52.595 --> 00:39:56.298]  And when he died, he would lie in state in a glass coffin
[00:39:56.878 --> 00:40:05.960]  And at his burial, dignitaries, and he spoke about princes and rulers and so on, would come from all over the world to pay respects at his graveside.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.080]  Now, the meaning of that is very, very clear.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:16.122]  I'll tell you, the reason I listen to stuff like this, there's a lot of false promises the Bible say, who go out and put out this info, but people like this, where it's been proven right over and over again, it's incredible.
[00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:25.144]  And I personally haven't had like full-on deals like this, but I've had experiences, dreams, and things that came true exactly later, so that's why I know how real this stuff is.
[00:40:26.292 --> 00:40:30.975]  Yeah, it can be, and I think everybody approaches this stuff with some skepticism.
[00:40:30.975 --> 00:40:35.397]  My father gave me the book to read at first, and I gave it back to him very dismissively.
[00:40:35.397 --> 00:40:47.603]  I thought it was absolute nonsense, until I began to see that what he prophesied or predicted was coming true word for word for word, very often in the same words that he used.
[00:40:47.603 --> 00:40:52.266]  And he did say that a bucket of blood would fall over in Zimbabwe.
[00:40:52.973 --> 00:41:02.879]  And once that bucket of blood fell over, in other words there would be a lot of blood spilt or blood shed, he said it would come into South Africa.
[00:41:02.879 --> 00:41:08.423]  So no, we don't know whether there's going to be bloodshed in Zimbabwe today, next week, next month, next year, who knows?
[00:41:08.423 --> 00:41:16.067]  But these are the things that we're paying attention to because so far he's been right and we're on the receiving end of a lot of pain at the moment.
[00:41:16.067 --> 00:41:18.449]  Everybody knows somebody who's been murdered,
[00:41:19.091 --> 00:41:20.192]  Or raped.
[00:41:20.192 --> 00:41:22.473]  Or whose child has been raped.
[00:41:22.473 --> 00:41:24.814]  Or who's been disfigured.
[00:41:24.814 --> 00:41:29.277]  I was on a farm recently, which has eight neighbouring farms.
[00:41:29.277 --> 00:41:35.540]  And on each of the eight neighbouring farms, somebody had been killed in recent years.
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.242]  Now that's, you know, it's severe.
[00:41:39.435 --> 00:41:41.597]  And it's getting worse, and it's what the communists do.
[00:41:41.597 --> 00:41:43.318]  It's helter-skelter.
[00:41:43.318 --> 00:41:44.939]  Simon, I'm really impressed with the work you're doing.
[00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:49.783]  Please come on, please have the leader of your organization on, and give us updates here.
[00:41:49.783 --> 00:41:53.967]  So please stay in contact, suidlanders.org.
[00:41:53.967 --> 00:42:00.712]  And people can, I guess, donate there to help get your civil emergency plan implemented and prepared.
[00:42:00.712 --> 00:42:01.453]  Please.
[00:42:01.453 --> 00:42:03.014]  We would appreciate it very much.
[00:42:03.014 --> 00:42:04.135]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:42:04.135 --> 00:42:04.695]  You bet.
[00:42:04.695 --> 00:42:05.156]  Absolutely.
[00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:05.616]  God bless you.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:13.305]  That's what we're here for, ladies and gentlemen, is making preparations because we know the enemy plans.
[00:42:13.305 --> 00:42:18.349]  We have a leg up if we take action, if we're ready.
[00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:22.512]  And again, they're trying to beat everybody into race-based garbage in the U.S.
[00:42:22.512 --> 00:42:23.453]  to make us fight with each other.
[00:42:23.453 --> 00:42:23.833]  We can't do it.
[00:42:23.833 --> 00:42:30.238]  We have to come together, love each other, see through it, and know it's class warfare that these globalists are carrying out.
[00:42:31.511 --> 00:42:33.351]  But no, they hate you because you're Christian.
[00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:41.233]  They're announcing world government, they're announcing microchips, they're announcing this new god that Google's been developing that's going to be AI that you worship, like right out of Revelation.
[00:42:41.233 --> 00:42:44.193]  I mean, look, it's happening.
[00:42:44.193 --> 00:42:48.454]  And most of the churches are cowards and are going along with it because they're not really churches, they just want the money.
[00:42:48.454 --> 00:42:50.754]  All right, Trump just escalated things with North Korea.
[00:42:50.754 --> 00:42:52.455]  I'll tell you about that on the other side.
[00:42:52.455 --> 00:42:59.216]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:42:59.216 --> 00:43:00.036]  I'm driving home.
[00:43:00.862 --> 00:43:05.125]  Here, about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving.
[00:43:05.125 --> 00:43:10.648]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am.
[00:43:10.648 --> 00:43:22.595]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action, and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other nations.
[00:43:23.533 --> 00:43:37.002]  Globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control society.
[00:43:37.998 --> 00:43:43.101]  And that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide with the enemy's tracking back.
[00:43:43.101 --> 00:43:48.965]  So just, please, we should all be so thankful to God and thankful to each other for taking action.
[00:43:48.965 --> 00:43:54.088]  And also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening.
[00:43:54.088 --> 00:43:56.729]  So for myself and my family, God bless you all.
[00:43:56.729 --> 00:43:57.550]  Have a great Thanksgiving.
[00:43:58.437 --> 00:44:01.580]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:09.006]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:44:09.006 --> 00:44:14.631]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:44:15.371 --> 00:44:23.075]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:44:23.075 --> 00:44:30.918]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:44:31.639 --> 00:44:36.703]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:44:36.703 --> 00:44:38.844]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:44:38.844 --> 00:44:52.233]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:47:00.422 --> 00:47:10.808]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:10.808 --> 00:47:13.370]  He's going the distance.
[00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:14.971]  He's going for speed.
[00:47:22.001 --> 00:47:40.926]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:40.926 --> 00:47:42.467]  Well Trump has declared
[00:47:43.553 --> 00:47:45.454]  North Korea, an aider of terrorist states.
[00:47:45.454 --> 00:47:47.676]  That means they can stop their ships.
[00:47:47.676 --> 00:47:49.857]  That means they can put more sanctions on them.
[00:47:49.857 --> 00:47:54.040]  That means that it's just one more ratchet up towards war.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:59.203]  We have that story up on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:47:59.203 --> 00:48:00.584]  Then I've got all this other news.
[00:48:00.584 --> 00:48:02.045]  Visos and Deep State Unite.
[00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:04.887]  Amazon launches cloud service for CIA.
[00:48:04.887 --> 00:48:08.489]  We first talked about this about a year ago when it was just in trade publications, but
[00:48:09.221 --> 00:48:11.244]  This has far-reaching implications.
[00:48:11.244 --> 00:48:13.326]  I'll explain why here in just a second.
[00:48:13.326 --> 00:48:19.574]  Also, Saudi Arabia vows to take on Iran amid warnings the region is in dangerous abyss.
[00:48:19.574 --> 00:48:20.695]  That's out of the express.
[00:48:20.695 --> 00:48:25.942]  We told you months ago war there is looming and may be imminent.
[00:48:25.942 --> 00:48:27.524]  But the first big thing I want to get to
[00:48:28.746 --> 00:48:30.147]  Charles Manson is so interesting.
[00:48:30.147 --> 00:48:35.331]  It's hard to not... Because usually when I talk about Charles Manson, people don't really make a big deal out of it because he's not in the news.
[00:48:35.331 --> 00:48:41.797]  But now, whatever we talk about with Manson, we'll end up getting millions of views on Facebook and Twitter and places, and we'll reach new people.
[00:48:41.797 --> 00:48:43.078]  They need to know about MKUltra.
[00:48:43.078 --> 00:48:49.783]  They need to know about the program he was part of to destabilize and try to trigger a race war for cultural upheaval.
[00:48:51.471 --> 00:48:55.252]  Because the globalists don't want us to be Christian and to come together and not be racist.
[00:48:55.252 --> 00:49:00.032]  They want to claim they're fighting racism while stirring everyone up to be racist.
[00:49:00.032 --> 00:49:03.633]  That's really the secret plan, which isn't a secret anymore.
[00:49:03.633 --> 00:49:06.674]  So we're going to talk about all that coming up.
[00:49:06.674 --> 00:49:08.854]  But first, expert.
[00:49:08.854 --> 00:49:12.635]  Great crash of 2018 will start in the bond market.
[00:49:12.635 --> 00:49:15.995]  I saw this yesterday, did some more research.
[00:49:15.995 --> 00:49:17.855]  It is a top expert saying that.
[00:49:17.855 --> 00:49:20.736]  Many others are saying it too because it is so overvalued.
[00:49:22.345 --> 00:49:26.426]  Then I saw this this morning and I said, whoa, I better cover this.
[00:49:26.426 --> 00:49:32.267]  Euro crash with Angela Merkel's fourth term and Chancellor is in doubt as U.S.
[00:49:32.267 --> 00:49:34.807]  growth forecasts are on the rise.
[00:49:34.807 --> 00:49:37.808]  I'm going to break this down here in a moment because it's key.
[00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:48.190]  First off, though, ladies and gentlemen, we are running specials this week that are amongst the best we ever run.
[00:49:49.031 --> 00:49:55.352]  And I've been running more and more specials as things go on because I've noticed the bigger the specials I run, the more people buy product.
[00:49:55.352 --> 00:49:59.693]  But there's kind of a point at which we discount things so much that it isn't really funding our operation.
[00:49:59.693 --> 00:50:10.575]  And I've lately, the accountants have shown me, I've kind of reached that point where, hey, you're selling the probiotic at $5 over what it costs, and then you're doing free shipping.
[00:50:10.575 --> 00:50:12.815]  Alex, we're losing a dollar on average.
[00:50:12.815 --> 00:50:14.816]  Stop.
[00:50:14.816 --> 00:50:17.016]  And so it really does come down to that.
[00:50:18.094 --> 00:50:21.095]  Brainforce Plus is now back in stock.
[00:50:21.095 --> 00:50:22.255]  We got a small shipment in.
[00:50:22.255 --> 00:50:25.176]  We should get a lot more towards the end of December, but it's about to be sold out again.
[00:50:25.176 --> 00:50:28.057]  50% off and free shipping.
[00:50:28.057 --> 00:50:31.137]  That's the first big special of Black Friday week.
[00:50:31.137 --> 00:50:35.098]  We're just gonna have it right through this weekend.
[00:50:35.098 --> 00:50:37.339]  50% off.
[00:50:37.339 --> 00:50:39.359]  5,700 reviews by Power Reviews.
[00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:43.980]  4.6 stars.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.921]  And we just went out and researched the highest quality
[00:50:46.738 --> 00:51:00.283]  Brain-empowering, focus-empowering, energy-empowering in a healthy way, or organic substances that are known to be safe, and we put it in there and we shell it for $39 when Schimler compounds are 70 to 80.
[00:51:00.283 --> 00:51:04.224]  But when we shell it for 50% off, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off, it is $19.96.
[00:51:04.224 --> 00:51:07.366]  I mean, that is a great, great deal on a really, really powerful
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:26.263]  BrainPill, BrainForce Plus, now with 20% more capsules in each bottle, which was a big deal for us to do, because it cost a lot, some of the compounds.
[00:51:26.263 --> 00:51:27.204]  People love it, though.
[00:51:27.204 --> 00:51:29.404]  It is the overall total bestseller.
[00:51:29.404 --> 00:51:32.445]  We sold it at such a low price, it doesn't really fund the operation.
[00:51:32.445 --> 00:51:33.846]  X2 is one of our other top sellers.
[00:51:33.846 --> 00:51:34.826]  SuperMill is a great seller.
[00:51:34.826 --> 00:51:44.689]  The problem is it's made in a proprietary system, cold-pressed, so it's hard to always get it California standards, which is impossible to pass, basically, and then have enough of it cold-pressed, so it's sold out half the time.
[00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:47.132]  We've got that back in.
[00:51:47.132 --> 00:51:48.592]  But we've got a bunch of specials.
[00:51:48.592 --> 00:51:54.255]  We're going to be running new specials every single day.
[00:51:54.255 --> 00:51:58.376]  We've got Pro-Pure 25% off on that water filtration and free shipping.
[00:51:58.376 --> 00:52:00.417]  Brain Force Plus 25% off.
[00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:03.478]  So that is the specials that we've got for you today.
[00:52:03.478 --> 00:52:11.942]  We have the new products Floralife and we also have the Carnivore Digestive Enzyme that helps you absorb the nutrients and amino acids out of the meat and out of the
[00:52:13.507 --> 00:52:16.929]  Protein and out of the fat and out of the carbohydrates really is important.
[00:52:16.929 --> 00:52:24.272]  Floral Life Advanced Restoration 50 million live and we have the 15 million everyday maintenance that's excellent as well.
[00:52:24.272 --> 00:52:25.633]  And Carnivore now in stock.
[00:52:25.633 --> 00:52:26.894]  Try them out for yourself.
[00:52:26.894 --> 00:52:28.134]  We just commit to get these products.
[00:52:28.134 --> 00:52:30.276]  You help fund the operation and you help yourself.
[00:52:30.276 --> 00:52:33.557]  But when I remember to take all this stuff, it makes my life so much better.
[00:52:33.557 --> 00:52:34.198]  Then I forget.
[00:52:34.198 --> 00:52:40.100]  Then I wonder why I'm sluggish or why I'm, you know, not as, you know, stuff in my gut isn't perfect.
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:40.941]  And it's like, oh, wait.
[00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:52.164]  We have these things God gave us through nature that we've gone out and sourced and got the very best stuff that works really well and it's here and it's very, very popular but that's how, again, we fund this operation.
[00:52:52.164 --> 00:52:58.786]  So I want to thank you all for your support and everything you've been doing because without you we would not be here.
[00:52:58.786 --> 00:53:00.846]  And we're all facing the same globalist onslaught.
[00:53:00.846 --> 00:53:04.107]  We're all dealing with the same globalist operations.
[00:53:04.107 --> 00:53:07.548]  We're all facing down the barrel of that and without coming together
[00:53:09.617 --> 00:53:16.440]  And without supporting each other, and without really focusing on the fact that we're under attack, we have no future.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.962]  Humanity all has red blood.
[00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:25.785]  We all have one destiny if we choose it, to live together in peace and experience amazing secrets of the universe.
[00:53:25.785 --> 00:53:28.326]  And Trump's great crime is he's bringing people together.
[00:53:28.326 --> 00:53:29.827]  The globalists want to break the country.
[00:53:29.827 --> 00:53:32.468]  He first said we have a country, we have a nation, and it's great.
[00:53:32.987 --> 00:53:34.888]  And here's what made it great and let's come together.
[00:53:34.888 --> 00:53:40.012]  And they can't stand that because they want us alone and divided and pathetic and scared.
[00:53:40.012 --> 00:53:45.756]  And it's not just us reverse engineering their operations against us.
[00:53:45.756 --> 00:53:46.877]  We don't just have the WikiLeaks.
[00:53:46.877 --> 00:53:54.522]  We don't just have all these internal documents and statements and Gruber on TV saying, thank God you're so stupid.
[00:53:54.522 --> 00:53:59.565]  We have Sean Parker, former head of Facebook.
[00:53:59.565 --> 00:54:02.087]  We have the Facebook documents that got leaked.
[00:54:02.757 --> 00:54:16.202]  By high-level executives, they say there's no more than 10 executives and maybe 20 or 30 assistants that had access to the Facebook plan that got released earlier this year and got almost no attention.
[00:54:16.202 --> 00:54:19.623]  It was in the Australian newspapers because it got leaked in Australia.
[00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:28.626]  And it said, we keep them desperate, we keep our people poor, we want to keep them alone, we want to make them depressed, and we want to make them liberal so that they don't have a family.
[00:54:31.132 --> 00:54:35.795]  I mean, that is so diabolical!
[00:54:35.795 --> 00:54:42.740]  They exploit your vulnerability, they try to make you more vulnerable, and then they get up on TV and they admit it!
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.680]  Why did Parker do that?
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.361]  Is he a good guy?
[00:54:44.361 --> 00:54:54.327]  I don't know.
[00:54:54.327 --> 00:54:57.189]  It's just crazy.
[00:54:57.189 --> 00:54:58.930]  But we're on an express elevator to hell.
[00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.511]  And I don't say that to be negative.
[00:55:01.511 --> 00:55:04.172]  I'm an incredibly positive person.
[00:55:04.172 --> 00:55:13.576]  Positive in that we can change things and fix things, but I use the analogy of if you're drinking a bottle of vodka a day and your liver's starting to go out, the doctor says, hey, you don't stop.
[00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:15.257]  Your liver's going to fail.
[00:55:15.257 --> 00:55:18.339]  And, you know, we're not going to give alcoholics a new liver.
[00:55:18.339 --> 00:55:19.739]  You're going to die.
[00:55:19.739 --> 00:55:20.220]  You understand?
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:25.502]  And people look at the doctor and they say, you're just being a killjoy.
[00:55:25.502 --> 00:55:26.623]  You're just a punk.
[00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:27.863]  You're a fear monger.
[00:55:27.863 --> 00:55:29.064]  And a year later, they're in the ground.
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.042]  I had several friends.
[00:55:33.042 --> 00:55:35.324]  Hell, I've had more than that.
[00:55:35.324 --> 00:55:42.669]  Now that I'm this old, I just lost more family than... Lever failure, cousin, pretty young.
[00:55:42.669 --> 00:55:48.153]  Same age as me.
[00:55:48.153 --> 00:55:52.757]  And it's, you know, serious issue, and it's a good allegory.
[00:55:52.757 --> 00:55:54.258]  It's a good parallel.
[00:55:54.258 --> 00:55:55.459]  It's a good example of
[00:55:57.105 --> 00:56:06.449]  The New World Order is run by really selfish, cold-blooded people, and they think you deserve to be annihilated and destroyed and overtaken because you're not wise to this.
[00:56:06.449 --> 00:56:20.455]  I mean, I'm telling you, decades before they want you to know what their plans are, because they're so arrogant, they write white papers and they have events and, you know, twenty-something years ago, I'd have to dig around to find this and found it shocking.
[00:56:20.455 --> 00:56:25.097]  Look, Ted Turner says kill 90% of the public and dumb everybody down and cut off the resources.
[00:56:25.097 --> 00:56:26.037]  And he'd say it, you know, in a
[00:56:26.954 --> 00:56:27.494]  I mean, you know,
[00:56:57.412 --> 00:56:59.973]  19, 20 years ago, I'd read about human-animal chimeras.
[00:56:59.973 --> 00:57:04.154]  I didn't want to believe it, but it was in major elite publications.
[00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:08.275]  By elite, it just means to them, where they communicate with each other.
[00:57:08.275 --> 00:57:19.278]  They just talk about all this stuff like, they talk about you like you have less value than a grain of salt.
[00:57:19.278 --> 00:57:20.438]  And they just talk all about it.
[00:57:20.438 --> 00:57:26.280]  How once they get the computer grid in place to control everybody, then they're going to kill everybody.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.002]  But right now, there'd be a war you'd resist, you'd fight back.
[00:57:30.002 --> 00:57:31.863]  They'd never win a war right now, the globalists.
[00:57:31.863 --> 00:57:33.284]  It would end up blowing back on them.
[00:57:33.284 --> 00:57:44.430]  They've got to get you so drugged out, so whacked out, so confused, with robots, sentries, and computer grids everywhere, so that when they flip the switch, they've got autonomous robot armies to help them carry out the main wipeout.
[00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:46.211]  So again, it's coming, and just remember.
[00:57:48.383 --> 00:57:55.845]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[00:59:50.666 --> 00:59:53.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.479 --> 01:00:00.219]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:00.219 --> 01:00:02.420]  Thanksgiving.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.960]  One of the few true Americana holidays that we've got.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.181]  Probably my favorite holiday.
[01:00:08.181 --> 01:00:11.161]  The 23rd day of November 2017.
[01:00:11.161 --> 01:00:17.063]  We've seen total demonization of the Italian Christopher Columbus.
[01:00:17.063 --> 01:00:19.423]  We've seen the total demonization of Thanksgiving.
[01:00:19.423 --> 01:00:23.524]  We've seen attempts to get rid of the holiday.
[01:00:23.524 --> 01:00:24.284]  To use it to
[01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:32.635]  Cast dispersions on Western civilization and Western expansion that undoubtedly was a mess.
[01:00:32.635 --> 01:00:34.877]  And there were crimes on all sides.
[01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:44.262]  When I say all sides, it wasn't just the settlers, or it wasn't just the troops, or it wasn't just the empires, or it wasn't just all the different native tribes.
[01:00:44.262 --> 01:00:54.108]  It was all of those different countless changing factions that played into this long before black men colonized
[01:00:55.695 --> 01:01:02.040]  North America, the Vikings certainly visited it for a thousand years before Christopher Columbus supposedly discovered it.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.401]  That's now documented.
[01:01:04.401 --> 01:01:19.192]  But long before white men ever colonized it, all the native tribes did was run around and try to dominate and control each other and take over and kill the men and then take the women and the children.
[01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:23.372]  The same stuff that was going on in Europe for 10,000 years.
[01:01:23.372 --> 01:01:26.374]  Same stuff going on in Africa for 10,000 years.
[01:01:26.374 --> 01:01:29.776]  Same stuff going on everywhere in the world.
[01:01:29.776 --> 01:01:32.578]  Humans acted the same.
[01:01:32.578 --> 01:01:41.664]  And so, we never see big pieces being done on the bad things that the Native Americans did or the way they behaved.
[01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:45.447]  Because it's not part of the liberation theology.
[01:01:45.447 --> 01:01:49.169]  Starting in the 50s, the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment
[01:01:49.787 --> 01:01:59.220]  Created liberation theology where they thought that Jesus would have fought back and was a revolutionary and hated capitalism and was a communist.
[01:02:02.179 --> 01:02:09.062]  The different populations that were Christian, poor, black, Hispanic, you name it, to become liberation theologists.
[01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:10.123]  And that was just one part of it.
[01:02:10.123 --> 01:02:30.212]  But to teach that in the schools to everybody that America was bad, the founders were bad, this was an undermining of the nation state and our ethos, where we came from, so that people of color particularly wouldn't have a idea in their head that they had a right to the American birthright, or that they'd been part
[01:02:31.002 --> 01:02:33.963]  Critical parts of this great saga.
[01:02:33.963 --> 01:02:34.664]  No.
[01:02:34.664 --> 01:02:38.765]  It's all just, you were good, but you were exploited, and the whites were bad.
[01:02:38.765 --> 01:02:50.230]  When it was way more complex, with whites that were indentured servants, and bounties, and people basically as slaves, and company stores, and sharecroppers.
[01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:53.571]  But they just continue to play on the incredible ignorance of the public.
[01:02:53.571 --> 01:02:58.814]  The last few weeks, CNN claims they've broken the news that there's slave auctions in Libya.
[01:02:58.814 --> 01:02:59.694]  Broken the news?
[01:03:01.209 --> 01:03:08.356]  In seven different Muslim countries, they sell women on top slave blocks, you know, up on a stage.
[01:03:08.356 --> 01:03:09.217]  And it's all known.
[01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:10.498]  It's Muslims doing it.
[01:03:10.498 --> 01:03:19.507]  But all these reports from CNN breaking, you know, this supposed news that we've been talking about forever and others have been documenting.
[01:03:19.507 --> 01:03:23.972]  It's about, oh, the poor migrants, the poor babies, the poor migrants.
[01:03:23.972 --> 01:03:25.033]  These are people in Africa.
[01:03:25.839 --> 01:03:34.582]  That are being kidnapped and grabbed and sold into slavery by Muslims, but somehow they turn it into quote Muslims by using the term migrant.
[01:03:34.582 --> 01:03:38.564]  That's the new definition of Muslims is a migrant, never a Muslim invader.
[01:03:38.564 --> 01:03:45.386]  So they take Muslims of slaving people and then turn it into the catch all word of poor little Muslims, which is migrant.
[01:03:47.014 --> 01:03:49.656]  So they know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:49.656 --> 01:03:52.498]  But we're going to be covering that a lot more here during the transmission.
[01:03:52.498 --> 01:03:55.620]  But I'm proud of Thanksgiving and I give thanks to you, the audience.
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:56.561]  Thanks to God.
[01:03:56.561 --> 01:03:57.382]  Thanks to my family.
[01:03:57.382 --> 01:03:59.263]  Thanks to the great crew.
[01:03:59.263 --> 01:04:01.405]  And I just want to thank you all for what you've done.

[01:04:05.127 --> 01:04:07.569]  But we have new specials that are added each day.

[01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:11.492]  Super high quality.
[01:04:16.365 --> 01:04:17.366]  I don't know.
[01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:34.271]  A bunch of stuff is there.

[01:06:21.358 --> 01:06:23.559]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:23.559 --> 01:06:36.705]  We're now an hour into this worldwide broadcast, and joining us is a true visionary, best-selling author, researcher, scientist, Dr. Michael Savage.
[01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:42.508]  He's written many number one New York Times best-selling books, but he's got the newest one I can't wait to read, God Faith
[01:06:43.192 --> 01:06:44.313]  And reason.
[01:06:44.313 --> 01:06:54.081]  I think we should start first with the book and the time we have him with us, then we'll get into Russiagate and the calls for martial law, the calls for killing the president.
[01:06:54.081 --> 01:07:02.828]  Sweden is pushing to change their flag to an Islamic flag, saying that we started the Crusades and we're bad, despite the fact that it's the opposite.
[01:07:02.828 --> 01:07:09.013]  He was the first person I ever heard, like 15 years ago, say that liberalism was a mental disorder.
[01:07:10.257 --> 01:07:21.846]  And I got that some were clearly mentally ill, but now, with Trump derangement syndrome, it's a mass psychology of mass mental illness, and it's getting worse, and the most radical ones are adding to the hysteria.
[01:07:21.846 --> 01:07:26.029]  It's like telling a schizophrenic, oh, it is true, there are men in the walls coming to eat you.
[01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:27.891]  That'll make them go jump off a cliff.
[01:07:27.891 --> 01:07:38.119]  So now the media has told them, yes, Nazis are everywhere, yes, everything's horrible, even though the economy's getting better and all these good things are happening, they are literally going insane and assaulting
[01:07:38.759 --> 01:07:44.344]  Dr. Savage, myself, women wearing Make America Great Again hats are being beaten up on the street.
[01:07:44.344 --> 01:07:48.268]  Michael Savage, you told us what was coming, so tell us the next level.
[01:07:48.268 --> 01:07:52.131]  What's coming next?
[01:07:52.131 --> 01:07:55.274]  Look, I wrote God, Faith, and Reason, but that doesn't mean that I talk to God.
[01:07:55.274 --> 01:07:57.816]  I've been looking for Him all my life, you know.
[01:07:57.816 --> 01:08:02.581]  What's coming next is just finish the narrative of where the insane go.
[01:08:03.385 --> 01:08:06.069]  When the insane take over the asylum, what do they do?
[01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:09.113]  They kill everyone in sight, then they start eating each other.
[01:08:09.113 --> 01:08:09.974]  They eat each other.
[01:08:09.974 --> 01:08:10.996]  They become cannibals.
[01:08:10.996 --> 01:08:16.504]  I predict cannibalism is on the horizon, which will be sold as a wholesome alternative to veganism.
[01:08:17.367 --> 01:08:21.108]  In other words, you go all the way down the line of no living creatures, but now eat people.
[01:08:21.108 --> 01:08:22.748]  Because that's the natural way.
[01:08:22.748 --> 01:08:31.371]  After all, that's the way it was done in the South Pacific until the missionaries came along and told the savages, it's not okay to eat your daughter's nose, which they did.
[01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:33.351]  I spent many years in the South Pacific.
[01:08:33.351 --> 01:08:39.493]  The last piece of human flesh that was known to have been eaten in the Fiji Islands was in 1939 in front of a missionary.
[01:08:39.493 --> 01:08:46.555]  When they took a young girl, you talk about molestation, they took one of the young girls from the servant class, actually the slave class in their village,
[01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:51.393]  And they cut her nose off and threw it on the fire to roast it for the missionary.
[01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:52.954]  And he respectfully declined.
[01:08:52.954 --> 01:08:53.794]  Yes, that's right.
[01:08:53.794 --> 01:08:56.496]  Missionaries save them from cannibalism.
[01:08:56.496 --> 01:08:58.297]  Never given credit for that.
[01:08:58.297 --> 01:09:02.840]  Because the psychotics must go through hell in order to be saved.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.041]  And that's where they're going.
[01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:05.281]  But they're not taking me with them.
[01:09:05.281 --> 01:09:06.602]  I'll tell you right now, Alex.
[01:09:06.602 --> 01:09:08.083]  They're not taking you with them.
[01:09:08.083 --> 01:09:10.004]  They're not taking your audience with them.
[01:09:10.004 --> 01:09:13.427]  All I can say is, if they want to go there, good luck to them.
[01:09:13.427 --> 01:09:15.528]  But don't try to take us because we ain't going with you.
[01:09:16.375 --> 01:09:17.515]  And what you're saying is dead on.
[01:09:17.515 --> 01:09:20.937]  I remember listening about two years ago, you said they're going to eat their own.
[01:09:20.937 --> 01:09:24.118]  The next level of psychotic behavior is cannibalism.
[01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:29.419]  Inmates literally killing the wardens and then finally killing themselves.
[01:09:29.419 --> 01:09:40.343]  And they're already politically doing it with Donna Brazile coming out and Wolf Blitzer and even Rachel Maddow's brother over there, Hayes or whatever his name is.
[01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:43.504]  They're all turning against the Clintons right now.
[01:09:43.504 --> 01:09:44.384]  What do you make of this?
[01:09:46.684 --> 01:09:47.305]  It's a game.
[01:09:47.305 --> 01:09:48.646]  It's a shell game.
[01:09:48.646 --> 01:09:54.813]  They know she's unelectable, so they figure get rid of her and get someone even more psychotic than she is.
[01:09:54.813 --> 01:09:56.776]  Someone more power mad than she is.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:02.202]  Someone more to the left, if you want to put it in common parlance, than she is.
[01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:03.382]  She's yesterday's news.
[01:10:03.382 --> 01:10:04.383]  She lost the election.
[01:10:04.383 --> 01:10:07.164]  She's burned her... her path is over.
[01:10:07.164 --> 01:10:10.265]  So you figure, you know, Burnham, what have they got to lose this way they can make believe they're fair?
[01:10:10.265 --> 01:10:13.286]  Now, what is worse than Hillary Clinton?
[01:10:13.286 --> 01:10:22.530]  Hillary Clinton is power-mad, but in a strange way, she's a centrist power-mad person, leavened by her husband, by the way, who's far less crazy than she is.
[01:10:23.504 --> 01:10:25.365]  I don't think you've heard anyone say that.
[01:10:25.365 --> 01:10:29.767]  Bill Clinton would be less of a danger to the country than Hillary is.
[01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:33.769]  But yesterday's news, they're old, they're not progressive enough, you know, Alex.
[01:10:33.769 --> 01:10:38.711]  You've got to get someone who's half lizard, half human.
[01:10:39.605 --> 01:10:45.931]  And wholly insane in order to run for office and have a Machel Radkau, you know, support her.
[01:10:45.931 --> 01:10:47.853]  Wolf Blitzer, I don't know what did it to him.
[01:10:47.853 --> 01:10:49.715]  Nice Jewish boy from Israel.
[01:10:49.715 --> 01:10:53.098]  Comes to America, makes a fortune, and then hates the country.
[01:10:53.098 --> 01:10:54.159]  What did it?
[01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:57.603]  My guess is all the carbon dioxide from all the seltzer in Brooklyn.
[01:10:57.603 --> 01:11:00.205]  That's what I think accounts for most of the liberalism.
[01:11:00.205 --> 01:11:01.907]  I mean, they say carbon dioxide is a threat.
[01:11:01.907 --> 01:11:04.009]  They're obsessed with carbon dioxide without even knowing
[01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:06.870]  That without carbon dioxide, there wouldn't be any plant life.
[01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:08.792]  Without plant life, we'd all be dead.
[01:11:08.792 --> 01:11:20.081]  And of course, what's interesting is that during the period when we had higher levels of carbon dioxide, I'm talking eons ago, there was more plant life, which allowed more animal life to grow.
[01:11:20.081 --> 01:11:29.149]  Having said all of that, all the years in New York City that the seltzer men were around selling these bottles of seltzer on trucks, it was a very popular beverage.
[01:11:29.884 --> 01:11:37.949]  Well, I think that the little bubbles of carbon dioxide in the seltzer water somehow crossed the blood-brain barrier and destroyed an entire generation that's now running the media.
[01:11:37.949 --> 01:11:38.749]  I can name them all.
[01:11:38.749 --> 01:11:40.350]  Wolf Blitzer, seltzer.
[01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:42.491]  Carbon dioxide, toxic poisoning.
[01:11:42.491 --> 01:11:52.837]  Shall I name all of those who must have been OD'd on seltzer as children as they sat around the tables discussing Karl Marx and Engels for breakfast and then were sent to camps in the Poconos?
[01:11:53.337 --> 01:11:55.340]  The Red Diaper Doper Baby Camps?
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.684]  Where they could go to communist camps and sing the Communist Internationale?
[01:11:58.684 --> 01:12:03.170]  If you think I'm making this up, people don't know anything about the history of the New York Liberal.
[01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:05.053]  I know everything about it because I ran from them.
[01:12:06.252 --> 01:12:07.092]  Well, absolutely.
[01:12:07.092 --> 01:12:11.673]  There's a lot of folks that actually went through that that will tell you, like Joseph Farah, your friend from WorldNetDaily.
[01:12:11.673 --> 01:12:23.976]  He was a young Lebanese-American, but his parents were communists in New York, and they literally sent him to communist camp, and were literally training him to be a weather underground person.
[01:12:23.976 --> 01:12:26.516]  Well, I was never trained to be a weather underground person.
[01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:30.657]  I was trained just to get out there and not get stepped on by life.
[01:12:30.657 --> 01:12:32.757]  And, you know, here I am.
[01:12:32.757 --> 01:12:35.178]  You know, Alex, it'll be 24 years this March.
[01:12:36.044 --> 01:12:37.025]  That I'm in radio.
[01:12:37.025 --> 01:12:42.368]  It was purely as a result of praying to God to open up the Red Sea for me that this happened.
[01:12:42.368 --> 01:12:47.951]  But I've told my listeners, and I'm going to tell them again today, and I'd like to mention it to your great audience.
[01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:49.532]  Okay, what's this with the God book, Savage?
[01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:50.813]  What, did you suddenly find religion?
[01:12:50.813 --> 01:12:52.714]  It's not that I found religion.
[01:12:52.714 --> 01:12:58.618]  I've been searching for... I've been looking for God ever since I've been a little boy.
[01:12:58.618 --> 01:13:02.960]  Whether it was the little boy story that I tell boy in the papers in the street.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.722]  Four-year-old kid, Bronx, Longfellow Avenue.
[01:13:06.617 --> 01:13:08.690]  A Jewish newspaper is blowing up the street.
[01:13:09.497 --> 01:13:10.738]  I thought it was a holy book.
[01:13:10.738 --> 01:13:13.961]  I didn't even understand the language, but I thought it was a holy book.
[01:13:13.961 --> 01:13:17.523]  I ran after these sheets of paper in the street, bundled them up in the wind.
[01:13:17.523 --> 01:13:18.824]  It's a true story.
[01:13:18.824 --> 01:13:21.747]  Brought home this whole bundle of paper.
[01:13:21.747 --> 01:13:22.987]  Mom, look what I found.
[01:13:22.987 --> 01:13:23.748]  Look what I found.
[01:13:23.748 --> 01:13:24.829]  I saved this.
[01:13:24.829 --> 01:13:26.390]  And she laughed and she patted me on the head.
[01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:27.371]  She said, it's okay, Michael.
[01:13:27.371 --> 01:13:28.832]  It's just a newspaper.
[01:13:28.832 --> 01:13:30.954]  So I've been looking for evidence.
[01:13:30.954 --> 01:13:31.734]  The evidence.
[01:13:31.734 --> 01:13:32.335]  The evidence.
[01:13:32.335 --> 01:13:33.115]  The evidence.
[01:13:33.115 --> 01:13:34.897]  And all I found are glimpses.
[01:13:34.897 --> 01:13:36.358]  And here's my most important point.
[01:13:36.938 --> 01:13:39.420]  It's my Einsteinian moment, Alex.
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.961]  I discovered it in writing this book.
[01:13:41.961 --> 01:13:43.662]  Why is God invisible to us?
[01:13:43.662 --> 01:13:45.844]  Why are we not idol worshippers?
[01:13:45.844 --> 01:13:53.249]  Why are we not worshipping period blood and chicken feathers as so many of the immigrants seem to do in basements?
[01:13:53.249 --> 01:13:56.611]  You know, with chickens and vultures and God knows what.
[01:13:56.611 --> 01:14:00.113]  You drive around San Francisco, they used to be in New York on the cars
[01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:03.629]  A little Saint Christopher medal on the dashboard, right?
[01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:05.690]  I figured they're nice Catholic people.
[01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:09.530]  You drive around in San Francisco, they can't even see through the windshield.
[01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:13.551]  Dream catchers, pillows, voodoo dolls.
[01:14:13.551 --> 01:14:16.512]  This is the meltdown of the United States of America.
[01:14:16.512 --> 01:14:23.653]  Once we lost our connection to the roots of America, which was deeply rooted in monotheism, in one God.
[01:14:23.653 --> 01:14:26.914]  Once we lost that, we started to lose America.
[01:14:26.914 --> 01:14:29.334]  And it all started with Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary,
[01:14:30.283 --> 01:14:31.244]  And William Kunstler.
[01:14:31.244 --> 01:14:34.185]  The three most evil people in the history of this country.
[01:14:34.185 --> 01:14:37.567]  Who took this country from where it was to where it is.
[01:14:37.567 --> 01:14:40.509]  And we've only begun on this insane road, Alex.
[01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:41.369]  You know it and I know it.
[01:14:41.369 --> 01:14:42.950]  You live it every day.
[01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:45.732]  So what are we on the other side of reality supposed to do?
[01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:47.193]  Put up with it?
[01:14:47.193 --> 01:14:47.873]  Well, we do.
[01:14:47.873 --> 01:14:50.054]  But we gotta resist the resistors.
[01:14:50.054 --> 01:14:51.575]  Because we are the true resistance.
[01:14:51.575 --> 01:14:52.716]  They're garbage.
[01:14:52.716 --> 01:14:53.276]  They're nothing.
[01:14:53.829 --> 01:14:54.590]  They're insane.
[01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.631]  They'll go away like you blow them down in the wind.
[01:14:56.631 --> 01:14:59.093]  And historically, we're going to come back and talk about it.
[01:14:59.093 --> 01:15:00.154]  I'm not to fear them.
[01:15:00.154 --> 01:15:01.194]  They're nothing.
[01:15:01.194 --> 01:15:02.315]  They're garbage.
[01:15:02.315 --> 01:15:11.382]  And I want to know why the Hells Angels haven't come out, the plumbers haven't come out with pipes, the electricians haven't come out with wire, and said, cross this line.
[01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:12.303]  That's it.
[01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:19.308]  You know, back in the 60s, during the anti-war demonstrations, in New York, the head of the plumbers union said, enough is enough with these scumbags.
[01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:23.791]  And he called out the plumbers to come out to the next hippie march.
[01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.272]  Let me tell you something.
[01:15:25.272 --> 01:15:27.853]  The hippies never marched again where the plumbers were.
[01:15:27.853 --> 01:15:28.974]  And that's what has to happen.
[01:15:28.974 --> 01:15:30.595]  There has to be a line in this country.
[01:15:30.595 --> 01:15:33.497]  It's enough of these insane crybabies.
[01:15:33.497 --> 01:15:35.979]  All right, Michael Savage is on fire today.
[01:15:35.979 --> 01:15:39.221]  So we're going to come back and get more into the book, because he's absolutely right.
[01:15:39.221 --> 01:15:40.622]  He called it his Einsteinian moment.
[01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:41.989]  It's true.
[01:15:41.989 --> 01:15:48.412]  Once you have just basic good God out of your life, you disintegrate into human sacrifice idiocy.
[01:15:48.412 --> 01:15:51.673]  The mass mental craziness is intensifying.
[01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:52.934]  We'll cover it on the other side.
[01:15:56.224 --> 01:16:02.987]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:16:02.987 --> 01:16:07.249]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[01:17:26.557 --> 01:17:28.357]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:17:28.357 --> 01:17:30.018]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:19:59.316 --> 01:20:01.958]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:08.784 --> 01:20:13.787]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.052 --> 01:20:33.080]  Alright, I'm not going to be talking much because Savage rarely gets wound up here on the air.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.904]  A lot of times when he does, he gets so angry he's got to go off the air.
[01:20:35.904 --> 01:20:40.671]  I'm going to try to just let him flow because he's in rare form today and I love it.
[01:20:40.671 --> 01:20:41.893]  As long as he'll stay with us this hour.
[01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:44.100]  Or much of this hour.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:49.163]  He's got the new book out that I can't wait to read, God, Faith, and Reason, Michael Savage.
[01:20:49.163 --> 01:20:56.889]  The fact that Michael Savage was looking for God, like Carl Jung was seeing in Archetypes, meant that he had God's stamp on him.
[01:20:56.889 --> 01:21:10.758]  People that are looking to destroy God and overturn goodness and overturn decency, and who say there isn't a God, and who are saying that basically they're God, or they're going to destroy God, or they're going to worship human sacrifice, or they're going to worship ugliness,
[01:21:11.278 --> 01:21:12.600]  They're of their father, the devil.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.042]  I don't care what religion or culture you come from.
[01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:29.376]  When you look at globalism, the leftists, the Soviets, the Nazis, all these authoritarian systems, they had a bloodlust to run everybody else's lives, to control language, and basically had a mass psychology and a will to kill.
[01:21:30.023 --> 01:21:32.104]  And that's what Michael Savage was starting to get into.
[01:21:32.104 --> 01:21:35.646]  And now we see the left going, yeah, we want guns, we're going to kill you.
[01:21:35.646 --> 01:21:36.746]  And we're communist.
[01:21:36.746 --> 01:21:37.607]  And we hate you.
[01:21:37.607 --> 01:21:39.207]  And we're going to bring in radical Islamists.
[01:21:39.207 --> 01:21:41.868]  And we're going to let them promote slavery in their own countries.
[01:21:41.868 --> 01:21:42.809]  We're going to have Muslim women.
[01:21:43.792 --> 01:21:47.773]  We're hardcore islamicists, like Linda Saucer, lead women's marches.
[01:21:47.773 --> 01:21:56.215]  We now learn what it's really all about as the gloves come off, the mask comes off, and we're face to face with 21st century evil.
[01:21:56.215 --> 01:21:58.916]  Michael Savage, you were on fire last segment.
[01:21:58.916 --> 01:22:10.899]  I'm showing footage of Mall of America from two days ago on our TV feed, where a Somali man stabbed another two people, screaming Allah Akbar, and now many areas of the country look like Somalia.
[01:22:10.899 --> 01:22:11.579]  Please continue.
[01:22:13.266 --> 01:22:16.407]  Well, on my website I put up Somali Muslim stabs.
[01:22:16.407 --> 01:22:17.747]  They didn't report that.
[01:22:17.747 --> 01:22:19.407]  They said it was a burglary gone wrong.
[01:22:19.407 --> 01:22:21.487]  I never saw such propaganda in my life.
[01:22:21.487 --> 01:22:22.788]  Trump calls it fake news.
[01:22:22.788 --> 01:22:24.188]  This is not fake news.
[01:22:24.188 --> 01:22:26.388]  This is beyond Goebbels what we're seeing.
[01:22:26.388 --> 01:22:31.689]  I have never thought I'd live through a time when you look at people in the media.
[01:22:31.689 --> 01:22:32.969]  They look normal.
[01:22:32.969 --> 01:22:34.270]  They look like they want to live.
[01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:35.830]  They don't look suicidal.
[01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:40.151]  You know, ordinary men, women of all races, they're insane.
[01:22:40.151 --> 01:22:41.091]  They're suicidal.
[01:22:41.091 --> 01:22:42.451]  They're digging their children's graves.
[01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:47.144]  What is it going to take for them to understand that they are the problem?
[01:22:47.144 --> 01:22:49.886]  They're the gatekeepers of information.
[01:22:49.886 --> 01:22:51.167]  We're marginal.
[01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:55.429]  You have a small show that's large in reach and power.
[01:22:55.429 --> 01:23:01.213]  I have a show that's small in a way but very large in reach and power.
[01:23:01.213 --> 01:23:07.317]  Alex, can we save the country from these insane bastards before it's too late?
[01:23:07.317 --> 01:23:09.758]  Well, this is different than other countries.
[01:23:09.758 --> 01:23:11.299]  We're not disarmed.
[01:23:11.299 --> 01:23:12.980]  We haven't been disarmed.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:22.563]  And let me tell you something, there are tens of thousands of retired military, retired cops, and unretired military and unretired cops.
[01:23:22.563 --> 01:23:24.064]  No one's stepping on them.
[01:23:24.064 --> 01:23:30.086]  It's just not going to be as easy as it was in 1917 in Russia, where the guns had been seized.
[01:23:30.086 --> 01:23:39.069]  It's certainly not going to be as easy as the knocking on the door in Germany, Poland, Hungary, and the other places where the Jews and others had been disarmed.
[01:23:40.232 --> 01:23:42.175]  And is that why they're so upset?
[01:23:42.175 --> 01:23:47.922]  Is it because our ancestors laid down provisions for just their type of scum?
[01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:48.963]  I don't know who we're talking about.
[01:23:48.963 --> 01:23:49.964]  We say they.
[01:23:49.964 --> 01:23:51.046]  Who's the head of this?
[01:23:51.046 --> 01:23:52.207]  I mean, who are the leftists?
[01:23:52.207 --> 01:23:53.409]  Mentally ill?
[01:23:53.409 --> 01:23:55.091]  Devil worshipers?
[01:23:55.091 --> 01:23:57.974]  How many are there of these boogeymen?
[01:23:57.974 --> 01:23:58.435]  Who are they?
[01:23:59.170 --> 01:23:59.710]  Who are they?
[01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:18.816]  Who's actually... They're the SJWs, they're the mainstream media, it's the Hollywood crowd, it's the big mega banks, it's all the elites that want to... It's people like Jeff Bezos who gets all this taxpayer money and all these monopolies and then he's literally working with the Washington Post to try to shut me and Matt Drudge and others down and calling us all Russian agents.
[01:24:19.873 --> 01:24:21.634]  Yeah, I saw that's crazy about Drudge.
[01:24:21.634 --> 01:24:22.694]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:24:22.694 --> 01:24:30.317]  I mean, this guy sends more traffic to the Washington Post than anyone else, and they attack him to show you how insane they really are.
[01:24:30.317 --> 01:24:32.397]  But let's forget Bezos for one minute.
[01:24:32.397 --> 01:24:34.018]  We say the enemy, the enemy there.
[01:24:34.018 --> 01:24:35.418]  They want to get us.
[01:24:35.418 --> 01:24:37.599]  You touched on an important point, okay?
[01:24:37.599 --> 01:24:43.401]  God, the way we know God, Christians or Jews in this country, gives us free will.
[01:24:43.401 --> 01:24:46.942]  We're ultimately the most free people on earth.
[01:24:46.942 --> 01:24:48.563]  If we actually believe in God,
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.361]  We come to understand we have free will.
[01:24:51.361 --> 01:24:54.783]  He gave us life, but we have free will to act out our lives.
[01:24:54.783 --> 01:25:00.707]  The opposite are the statists or the central governmentists, if you want to call them, all of these other demons.
[01:25:00.707 --> 01:25:02.468]  They say, no, you have no free will.
[01:25:02.468 --> 01:25:04.269]  We are your will.
[01:25:04.269 --> 01:25:05.409]  We are your will.
[01:25:05.409 --> 01:25:06.290]  We are the Hitlers.
[01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:07.591]  We are the Stalins.
[01:25:07.591 --> 01:25:08.911]  We are the Mussolini's.
[01:25:08.911 --> 01:25:10.512]  We are the Pol Pot's.
[01:25:10.512 --> 01:25:12.734]  We tell you what shall be.
[01:25:12.734 --> 01:25:13.714]  We are your will.
[01:25:13.714 --> 01:25:15.135]  You have no freedom.
[01:25:15.135 --> 01:25:16.436]  You're just a moat in the mire.
[01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:19.391]  A moat in the mire, you're nothing.
[01:25:19.391 --> 01:25:23.353]  And that is the greatest threat to these globalists, which is free will.
[01:25:23.353 --> 01:25:26.095]  Individualism, if you want to call it that.
[01:25:26.095 --> 01:25:33.138]  So I, as a tremendously independent individual, I never liked anyone telling me what to do.
[01:25:33.138 --> 01:25:35.239]  It's just a part of my nature.
[01:25:35.239 --> 01:25:36.400]  It doesn't mean I'm a tough guy.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:36.720]  I'm not.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:37.641]  I'm not bulletproof.
[01:25:37.641 --> 01:25:41.002]  I'm just resistant to people telling me what to do.
[01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:42.183]  You're not taking it lying down.
[01:25:43.476 --> 01:25:47.077]  Whether it was a teacher saying to me when I was young, you're not a gentleman.
[01:25:47.077 --> 01:25:48.698]  I used to hear that all the time.
[01:25:48.698 --> 01:25:49.878]  I didn't want to be a gentleman.
[01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.719]  What do you mean you're not a gentleman?
[01:25:51.719 --> 01:25:52.379]  What does that mean?
[01:25:52.379 --> 01:25:54.099]  Remember how they train kids?
[01:25:54.099 --> 01:25:55.340]  You're not a gentleman?
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:56.100]  What do you want me to do?
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:58.901]  What do you want to step on me and put on a skirt?
[01:25:58.901 --> 01:26:02.042]  You want to turn me into like a trans whatever?
[01:26:02.042 --> 01:26:03.922]  I mean, get off my back.
[01:26:03.922 --> 01:26:05.023]  Don't tell me what to do.
[01:26:05.023 --> 01:26:06.103]  I'll tell you what to do.
[01:26:06.835 --> 01:26:08.998]  So now, we're facing this thing with God.
[01:26:08.998 --> 01:26:09.738]  Let's go back to God.
[01:26:09.738 --> 01:26:12.001]  The E equals MC squared moment.
[01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:13.182]  I didn't even explain it.
[01:26:13.182 --> 01:26:14.684]  It's the most important thing.
[01:26:14.684 --> 01:26:15.625]  Okay.
[01:26:15.625 --> 01:26:16.906]  So all my life, I've looked for God.
[01:26:16.906 --> 01:26:17.547]  I can't find Him.
[01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:18.588]  I'm saying, where's God?
[01:26:18.588 --> 01:26:19.089]  Where's God?
[01:26:19.089 --> 01:26:19.609]  I can't see Him.
[01:26:19.609 --> 01:26:22.092]  The Buddhists worship a statue, right?
[01:26:22.092 --> 01:26:23.674]  In essence, they're idol worshippers.
[01:26:23.674 --> 01:26:24.675]  I love their poetry.
[01:26:25.296 --> 01:26:27.078]  But basically, you're worshipping an idol.
[01:26:27.078 --> 01:26:35.445]  All of these Catholics who left Catholicism to fake Buddhism, you know, with the hands in the restaurants, like, thank you for the water, and they thanked the waiter 50 times for a napkin.
[01:26:35.445 --> 01:26:37.547]  They don't even know what Buddhism is.
[01:26:37.547 --> 01:26:39.188]  That's not Buddhism.
[01:26:39.188 --> 01:26:44.553]  The fallen American religious person who becomes a Buddhist, they don't even know what Buddhism is.
[01:26:44.553 --> 01:26:45.914]  Okay, so now we come to us.
[01:26:46.832 --> 01:26:47.753]  We can't find God.
[01:26:47.753 --> 01:26:48.534]  We can't see God.
[01:26:48.534 --> 01:26:49.475]  We can't touch God.
[01:26:49.475 --> 01:26:49.715]  Why?
[01:26:49.715 --> 01:26:50.716]  Aha!
[01:26:50.716 --> 01:26:51.697]  The moment!
[01:26:51.697 --> 01:26:53.859]  God doesn't want us to see Him, feel Him, and touch Him.
[01:26:53.859 --> 01:26:54.740]  Why?
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:59.666]  Because in searching for Him everywhere, that's the finding.
[01:26:59.666 --> 01:27:00.967]  In searching, we find.
[01:27:00.967 --> 01:27:01.507]  That's the success.
[01:27:01.507 --> 01:27:04.531]  By the way, I hadn't read your book, but you notice I just said that.
[01:27:04.531 --> 01:27:09.436]  The fact that you were seeking as a child showed... I mean, that's the proof right there.
[01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:34.552]  Well, I always was looking for his presence, whether it was the newspaper blowing down the street, or looking at cloud formations, or studying the stars, or, you know, I became a biologist for a reason, which was to, you know, when I first saw the bones of a bird in anatomy, and I said, oh my God, look how God, or the grand designer, created the bones of a bird are hollow!
[01:27:36.656 --> 01:27:37.877]  Why are they hollow?
[01:27:37.877 --> 01:27:38.858]  So the bird can fly.
[01:27:38.858 --> 01:27:40.499]  The bones are lighter than ours, right?
[01:27:40.499 --> 01:27:43.260]  Mammalian bones are not hollow.
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:47.003]  The bird's bones have holes in them, in essence.
[01:27:47.003 --> 01:27:48.824]  This is so genius, right?
[01:27:48.824 --> 01:27:59.311]  And then you look at the bird's wing, fold it up, and you unfold it, and you see anatomical similarities to our hands, and you say, there has to be a grand design.
[01:28:00.094 --> 01:28:05.015]  Then you study Einstein, you know, the kids in college have the picture of him with the crazy ear with the tongue out.
[01:28:05.015 --> 01:28:06.555]  That wasn't Einstein.
[01:28:06.555 --> 01:28:17.978]  Einstein is the man who went to the perimeters of the universe and came back and said, the more I study the outreaches of the universe, the more I have to, the more I understand there has to be a God.
[01:28:17.978 --> 01:28:20.699]  That's what Einstein actually said in his later years.
[01:28:20.699 --> 01:28:22.459]  He wasn't this great atheistic hippie.
[01:28:23.813 --> 01:28:28.296]  And that's the left's triumph, is they take icons and turn them towards their service.
[01:28:28.296 --> 01:28:31.278]  Let's come back and talk about your Einstein moment.
[01:28:31.278 --> 01:28:34.900]  Straight ahead with Michael Savage, the new book, God, Faith, and Reason.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.162]  This is something you want to read and share with people.
[01:28:37.162 --> 01:28:39.303]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:28:39.303 --> 01:28:40.664]  Michael's got a dog in his lap.
[01:28:40.664 --> 01:28:42.445]  We're going to come back.
[01:28:42.445 --> 01:28:44.967]  That's my mascot.
[01:28:44.967 --> 01:28:47.549]  And by the way, he's real, because I feel he's real.
[01:28:47.549 --> 01:28:49.550]  Just like your trans people.
[01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:50.851]  Is he real?
[01:28:50.851 --> 01:28:52.172]  Do you identify as a walrus?
[01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:54.031]  Maybe I do.
[01:28:54.031 --> 01:28:54.772]  He looks real.
[01:28:54.772 --> 01:28:55.713]  He sounds real.
[01:28:55.713 --> 01:28:56.133]  Exactly.
[01:28:56.133 --> 01:29:01.238]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[01:29:01.238 --> 01:29:06.943]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[01:29:06.943 --> 01:29:12.148]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[01:29:12.148 --> 01:29:14.090]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:16.492]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[01:29:16.492 --> 01:29:17.093]  See guidelines.
[01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:20.683]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[01:29:20.683 --> 01:29:22.648]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:29:22.648 --> 01:29:24.494]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:29:25.982 --> 01:29:26.883]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:29:26.883 --> 01:29:29.264]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:29.264 --> 01:29:37.309]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:29:37.309 --> 01:29:39.231]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:39.231 --> 01:29:42.893]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:29:42.893 --> 01:29:47.556]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:29:47.556 --> 01:29:51.959]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:29:51.959 --> 01:29:52.439]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:29:57.262 --> 01:29:57.762]  Not a group.
[01:29:57.762 --> 01:29:59.203]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:29:59.203 --> 01:30:00.524]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:30:00.524 --> 01:30:01.745]  Why is this so good?
[01:30:01.745 --> 01:30:07.028]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:30:07.028 --> 01:30:20.575]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:30:20.575 --> 01:30:21.936]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:30:22.836 --> 01:30:24.358]  Spreading disease around.
[01:30:24.358 --> 01:30:26.939]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:30:26.939 --> 01:30:28.240]  These are all parasites.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.341]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:30.682]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:30:30.682 --> 01:30:35.185]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:30:35.185 --> 01:30:38.368]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:30:38.368 --> 01:30:41.530]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:42.571]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:30:42.571 --> 01:30:43.391]  Living Defense.

[01:30:44.492 --> 01:30:45.533]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:30:45.533 --> 01:30:48.235]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:48.415]  And I
[01:30:49.095 --> 01:30:50.136]  You support the broadcast.
[01:30:50.136 --> 01:30:51.477]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:30:51.477 --> 01:30:53.718]  Thank you, Dr. Groot, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:30:53.718 --> 01:30:57.641]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:30:57.641 --> 01:31:00.763]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:31:00.763 --> 01:31:08.188]  That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[01:31:08.188 --> 01:31:13.812]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:22.240]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:30.828]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:31:30.828 --> 01:31:35.912]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:31:35.912 --> 01:31:37.314]  They are the anti-liberals.
[01:31:38.012 --> 01:31:42.376]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide.
[01:31:42.376 --> 01:31:51.423]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:55.386]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:56.491 --> 01:32:06.700]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of a giant time bomb.
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:15.028]  With populations and globalism and the New World Order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy.
[01:32:15.028 --> 01:32:16.970]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[01:32:17.523 --> 01:32:20.326]  We've also got to have rear-guard actions to be prepared.
[01:32:20.326 --> 01:32:24.871]  The number one thing, after getting right with God, is to have high-quality, storable food.
[01:32:24.871 --> 01:32:30.957]  Well, the entire line of My Patriot Supply Foods, private-labeled as MFOR Select, is now 50% off.
[01:32:30.957 --> 01:32:35.061]  We've only done that one time before previously.
[01:32:35.061 --> 01:32:35.882]  50% off.
[01:32:35.882 --> 01:32:36.903]  You cannot beat that.
[01:32:37.243 --> 01:32:39.865]  And we're only doing that through Cyber Monday.
[01:32:39.865 --> 01:32:43.667]  So it starts today on Thanksgiving and runs through next Monday.
[01:32:43.667 --> 01:32:44.908]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:44.908 --> 01:32:46.789]  You can go right there.
[01:32:46.789 --> 01:32:48.490]  It's the full spectrum of myPatriot.
[01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:49.831]  It's private label by us.
[01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:50.752]  Totally fresh.
[01:32:50.752 --> 01:32:52.413]  Last 25 years.
[01:32:52.413 --> 01:32:53.914]  50% off.
[01:32:53.914 --> 01:32:54.114]  50% off.
[01:32:54.114 --> 01:32:58.096]  Take action today.
[01:32:58.096 --> 01:33:00.718]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:28.283]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:28.283 --> 01:33:33.849]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.849 --> 01:33:35.491]  And Michael Savage, what a treat.
[01:33:35.491 --> 01:33:36.732]  God, faith, and reason.
[01:33:36.732 --> 01:33:39.355]  Michael Savage, number one New York Times bestselling author.
[01:33:39.355 --> 01:33:40.056]  I cannot wait.
[01:33:41.309 --> 01:33:42.089]  To read this book.
[01:33:42.089 --> 01:33:45.710]  In fact, once the kids go to bed tonight, I'm going to start getting into it.
[01:33:45.710 --> 01:33:47.691]  Then I'll have until two in the morning reading the whole thing.
[01:33:47.691 --> 01:33:49.491]  I will get it read by this weekend.
[01:33:49.491 --> 01:33:56.673]  Because the more I burrow into the mental illness of the left, they're a bunch of people that want to be alphas, but they don't want the responsibility.
[01:33:56.673 --> 01:33:58.313]  And they're not real intellectuals.
[01:33:58.313 --> 01:34:04.675]  They want to say they're the intellectuals, then create an authoritarian system where all thought has to be approved by them.
[01:34:04.675 --> 01:34:07.355]  That's called a cult.
[01:34:07.355 --> 01:34:10.616]  And they are waging war with any stable civilization
[01:34:11.539 --> 01:34:15.620]  Because they want to conquer it, instead of joining with it.
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:20.142]  It's just a bunch of betas getting together and trying to be alphas, is my view.
[01:34:20.142 --> 01:34:26.704]  And Michael Savage, who just joined us, was getting into... I like the Brave New World analogy.
[01:34:26.704 --> 01:34:27.844]  Alpha, beta, gamma, delta.
[01:34:27.844 --> 01:34:29.045]  I think they're more like deltas.
[01:34:29.045 --> 01:34:33.126]  You look at guys like Wolf Blitzer, do you actually think he's even a beta?
[01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.087]  These people are fakers.
[01:34:35.087 --> 01:34:36.147]  There's nothing there.
[01:34:36.147 --> 01:34:38.668]  There's no education, there's no knowledge, there's no history.
[01:34:39.799 --> 01:34:40.940]  Or you bring others up.
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.241]  Well, what have they actually achieved?
[01:34:42.241 --> 01:34:42.621]  Who are they?
[01:34:42.621 --> 01:34:44.963]  What have they written that anyone will remember?
[01:34:44.963 --> 01:34:54.550]  Alex, I have to interject right now because I believe my book today, this one is my most important book, I think it's the definitive book I've written that could lead America back to the standards we hold in esteem.
[01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:58.745]  It may sound too megalomaniacal for most people, but you know what?
[01:34:58.745 --> 01:34:59.105]  So what?
[01:34:59.105 --> 01:34:59.786]  I've got to say it.
[01:34:59.786 --> 01:35:01.008]  If I won't, who will?
[01:35:01.008 --> 01:35:02.349]  If I'm not for myself, who will be?
[01:35:02.349 --> 01:35:03.451]  If I'm only for myself, who am I?
[01:35:03.451 --> 01:35:05.994]  But it's no brag, just fact.
[01:35:05.994 --> 01:35:11.140]  If not for people like you and a few others, Matt Drudge, Donald Trump, let's say it, myself and a few others,
[01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:13.603]  If we weren't here, we would have lost.
[01:35:13.603 --> 01:35:16.206]  So we have to admit, we are the resistance.
[01:35:16.206 --> 01:35:17.908]  Our audience is really the key.
[01:35:17.908 --> 01:35:18.949]  And so it's true.
[01:35:18.949 --> 01:35:21.812]  We would be totally defeated if it wasn't for us.
[01:35:21.812 --> 01:35:23.354]  And that means our audience.
[01:35:23.354 --> 01:35:24.716]  We're not taking credit.
[01:35:24.716 --> 01:35:28.580]  We're saying, we've got the munitions that will blow the enemy up.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.962]  We'd be out of business.
[01:35:30.746 --> 01:35:34.148]  Alex, I want to do something for you and your audience, which is this.
[01:35:34.148 --> 01:35:35.189]  You know, there's a lot of books.
[01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:36.910]  There's a lot of Hackney writing.
[01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:38.851]  This is my magnus opus.
[01:35:38.851 --> 01:35:41.132]  It's based on my entire life quest.
[01:35:41.132 --> 01:35:43.513]  Can I read you a half of a page?
[01:35:43.513 --> 01:35:44.494]  Hey, please take over.
[01:35:44.494 --> 01:35:45.334]  Please do the next segment.
[01:35:45.334 --> 01:35:45.935]  You've got the floor.
[01:35:45.935 --> 01:35:46.275]  Go ahead.
[01:35:46.275 --> 01:35:50.417]  I was at a funeral for a friend, a friend's father.
[01:35:50.417 --> 01:35:50.617]  And, um,
[01:35:52.327 --> 01:35:57.029]  I had told a friend of mine who was an American, you know, World War II hero, who was a bit of a Nazi.
[01:35:57.029 --> 01:35:57.789]  I loved him anyway.
[01:35:57.789 --> 01:35:58.730]  We're friends.
[01:35:58.730 --> 01:36:02.891]  We argue all the time, but we had a mutual respect for each other.
[01:36:02.891 --> 01:36:05.512]  And we'd fight, argue, whatever.
[01:36:05.512 --> 01:36:06.873]  So my friend's father dies.
[01:36:06.873 --> 01:36:08.394]  Henry had survived Auschwitz.
[01:36:08.394 --> 01:36:11.935]  They cut three of his fingers off in a saw.
[01:36:11.935 --> 01:36:13.876]  He was an extremely bitter man.
[01:36:13.876 --> 01:36:15.676]  So he dies.
[01:36:15.676 --> 01:36:18.758]  And so, I go to the funeral.
[01:36:18.758 --> 01:36:20.478]  And my friend of Nazi sympathies was Bob.
[01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:23.711]  So I'm going to read from there.
[01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:24.492]  It's a half a page.
[01:36:24.492 --> 01:36:30.639]  So Bob shut his mouth that night, many years ago, and as I've said, he tends to harbor certain Nazi sentiments.
[01:36:30.639 --> 01:36:37.146]  So when I told him about Murray's mutilated hand, I wasn't surprised at his lack of immediate pitying sounds.
[01:36:37.146 --> 01:36:39.689]  But I like a challenge, so I went on.
[01:36:39.689 --> 01:36:41.731]  Murray never cried about his hand, I told Bob.
[01:36:41.731 --> 01:36:43.233]  He came to America with Florence.
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:46.621]  Who he met somewhere over there and had a family, namely Joel.
[01:36:46.621 --> 01:36:48.622]  He was full of life this Murray.
[01:36:48.622 --> 01:36:49.582]  He was a big drinker.
[01:36:49.582 --> 01:36:50.683]  He loved women.
[01:36:50.683 --> 01:36:53.304]  He beat his son with a strap, but he was a big personality.
[01:36:53.304 --> 01:36:55.244]  Bob nodded at that.
[01:36:55.244 --> 01:36:59.706]  I think the anti-Semite in him liked the never cried and beat his son parts of Murray.
[01:36:59.706 --> 01:37:02.847]  So I proceeded with my funeral story.
[01:37:02.847 --> 01:37:05.108]  I had lost touch with my friend Joel for a few years.
[01:37:05.108 --> 01:37:09.270]  His wife threw him out for beating her and at least one of their daughters.
[01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:13.031]  And he was in one of his episodic hidings, this time from the Sheriff's Department.
[01:37:13.692 --> 01:37:18.877]  They were after him for his house and all his earnings to give to his greedy wife.
[01:37:18.877 --> 01:37:21.360]  Somehow I heard his father, Murray, had cancer and was dying.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.383]  I called his mother and went over a few days later.
[01:37:24.383 --> 01:37:25.965]  We brought over a bag of groceries.
[01:37:25.965 --> 01:37:30.049]  You know, French bread, a pound of sliced turkey, some wine, some vegetables, and a quart of milk.
[01:37:30.049 --> 01:37:32.972]  The usual stuff you bring when someone's sick, poor, and housebound.
[01:37:32.972 --> 01:37:35.895]  Florence and Joel greeted us at the door of their little one-bedroom apartment.
[01:37:37.353 --> 01:37:42.319]  I always liked it there, remembering the holidays in my own house when I was a boy.
[01:37:42.319 --> 01:37:49.408]  Having been in the antique business like my deceased father, Benny, the place was filled with oversized, high-quality furniture and paintings.
[01:37:49.408 --> 01:37:53.653]  Murray was in a bathrobe and a gigantic English armchair, shrunken but beautiful in a way.
[01:37:53.653 --> 01:37:54.574]  He pulled me close and said,
[01:37:55.735 --> 01:37:59.436]  I remember when you took me and Joel to Berkeley almost 20 years ago.
[01:37:59.436 --> 01:38:01.016]  I know you almost 20 years.
[01:38:01.016 --> 01:38:02.656]  That's not a short time, he said.
[01:38:02.656 --> 01:38:05.317]  You took me to a bar on Telegraph Avenue.
[01:38:05.317 --> 01:38:08.138]  Michael, those were the good times, now are the bad times.
[01:38:08.138 --> 01:38:09.738]  Bob, I prided you, hear this?
[01:38:09.738 --> 01:38:12.779]  I extend one good deed 20 years ago, and this guy remembers.
[01:38:12.779 --> 01:38:16.259]  It's like one of the best moments of his life, this one drink I bought him.
[01:38:16.259 --> 01:38:21.360]  So he goes fast into the hospital, where he insists they let him out, probably to die at home.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.441]  And three or four days later, boom, it's over like that.
[01:38:23.441 --> 01:38:24.041]  Joel told me
[01:38:24.801 --> 01:38:28.123]  He had been sick most of the night, vomiting, probably those toxic chemicals.
[01:38:28.123 --> 01:38:33.445]  He forces himself up and says, Joel, she's there on your left, the angel of death!
[01:38:33.445 --> 01:38:34.225]  Joel gets scared.
[01:38:34.225 --> 01:38:36.826]  He says, Pop, there's nobody here but me and Mom.
[01:38:36.826 --> 01:38:39.268]  Murray stares at the big chair across the small room.
[01:38:39.268 --> 01:38:41.629]  To your right, Joel, on the couch!
[01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:42.529]  There, there!
[01:38:42.529 --> 01:38:45.871]  He stands up, starts to walk across the room and collapses.
[01:38:45.871 --> 01:38:49.032]  I can see that even the anti-Semite Bob is tearing up.
[01:38:50.422 --> 01:38:51.723]  Wiping the tears from his face.
[01:38:51.723 --> 01:38:54.083]  Listen, you racist bastard, I said to him.
[01:38:54.083 --> 01:39:05.267]  Looking at that hole in the ground with Murray's casket so bare and hearing the rabbi's ancient chant and watching the young Mexican gravediggers move by that chant, I became reminded of my own hole waiting.
[01:39:05.267 --> 01:39:13.130]  I never knew where I wanted to live, I whispered to Joel's friend from Israeli intelligence, and I sure don't know where I want to die.
[01:39:13.130 --> 01:39:18.472]  We never know where we're going to die, he reminded me with a 70s rockers cackle and grin.
[01:39:21.328 --> 01:39:22.789]  That's it.
[01:39:22.789 --> 01:39:23.669]  I write jazz.
[01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:26.490]  See, people think of me in a way that I'm not.
[01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:27.610]  They make me into what I'm not.
[01:39:27.610 --> 01:39:28.611]  They categorize you.
[01:39:28.611 --> 01:39:31.251]  They categorize me.
[01:39:31.251 --> 01:39:35.833]  I'm fundamentally a poet and a writer who's also got some political beliefs.
[01:39:35.833 --> 01:39:38.614]  I'm not a politician who also writes.
[01:39:38.614 --> 01:39:40.995]  And they want to challenge me on a literary level.
[01:39:40.995 --> 01:39:43.235]  If they want to challenge me, let them write something better than that.
[01:39:43.235 --> 01:39:44.736]  It's in God, faith, and reason.
[01:39:44.736 --> 01:39:46.377]  This is not a book of preachy.
[01:39:46.377 --> 01:39:47.397]  This is a book of stories.
[01:39:48.175 --> 01:39:55.501]  Well, exactly, and what I get from that is death's the great equalizer, and all of our shared humanity and struggles together unify us.
[01:39:55.501 --> 01:40:00.485]  And if you tell stories about life and death and friends, it brings everybody together.
[01:40:00.485 --> 01:40:14.076]  A Holocaust survivor or some guy with Nazi sympathies, that's why they want to keep us divided and dumb the culture down, because literature like that, that points out real feelings we had, unifies us in our humanity and our life and our death.
[01:40:14.076 --> 01:40:17.039]  The vision is what we're talking about, and we have to remember that.
[01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:18.946]  As the true resistance.
[01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:21.587]  Isn't it interesting how smart the devil is?
[01:40:21.587 --> 01:40:25.430]  They take we who are the resistance and make themselves into resistors.
[01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.850]  Exactly.
[01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:30.513]  I see all these dumb idiots driving around here in San Francisco with the bumper stickers that say resist.
[01:40:30.513 --> 01:40:33.775]  And you've been saying and I've been saying we are the resistance for decades.
[01:40:33.775 --> 01:40:35.176]  Suddenly they're the resistance.
[01:40:35.176 --> 01:40:36.757]  No, we haven't taken the country back.
[01:40:36.757 --> 01:40:39.098]  We're just beginning to pull the puss out.
[01:40:41.905 --> 01:40:43.205]  Well, I understand all of it.
[01:40:43.205 --> 01:40:47.088]  The hatred for Donald Trump is not really a hatred for Donald Trump.
[01:40:47.088 --> 01:40:50.950]  It's a hatred for white, heterosexual, Christian males.
[01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:51.831]  We know that.
[01:40:51.831 --> 01:40:53.212]  Everyone knows that.
[01:40:53.212 --> 01:40:56.194]  It's because he's a white, heterosexual, Christian male.
[01:40:56.194 --> 01:40:59.756]  It's not because he's a left-winger or a right-winger.
[01:40:59.756 --> 01:41:05.239]  They just wanted somebody other than a white, heterosexual, Christian male in the White House.
[01:41:05.239 --> 01:41:05.640]  Period.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.220]  End of story.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.661]  I was going to ask you that if you could do one more little segment off the break.
[01:41:09.661 --> 01:41:16.282]  Now suddenly it's coming out, not mainly by minorities, it's mainly white people and others saying, whites are evil, get rid of them.
[01:41:16.282 --> 01:41:18.122]  If you have a white baby, abort it.
[01:41:18.122 --> 01:41:19.603]  Major feminist magazines.
[01:41:19.603 --> 01:41:27.645]  This isn't just a few people, the left is really showing us that they're anti-Christian, anti-white, to a Hitlerian level but reversed.
[01:41:27.645 --> 01:41:30.585]  But Hitler wasn't a Christian, he was anti-Christian.
[01:41:30.585 --> 01:41:32.106]  This is how it started.
[01:41:32.106 --> 01:41:34.106]  This is what they do, they demonize us first.
[01:41:34.935 --> 01:41:37.636]  Then they march us into the camps and then they kill us.
[01:41:37.636 --> 01:41:40.118]  I'm warning people out there, it's much worse than they think.
[01:41:40.118 --> 01:41:42.239]  It starts with an idea.
[01:41:42.239 --> 01:41:48.502]  The Holocaust started with an idea written by a French anti-Semite a long time before the ovens were actually built.
[01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:52.544]  A long time before the Zyklon B was actually manufactured.
[01:41:52.544 --> 01:41:54.705]  I'm warning everybody listening to me.
[01:41:54.705 --> 01:41:58.127]  These professors are the true evil Nazis of our time.
[01:41:58.807 --> 01:42:02.269]  These must be weeded out like the poison that they are.
[01:42:02.269 --> 01:42:09.792]  And the universities that harbor these evil, failed intellects must be called on the carpet as well.
[01:42:09.792 --> 01:42:10.872]  I blame the universities.
[01:42:10.872 --> 01:42:13.033]  I don't blame these marginal psychotics.
[01:42:13.033 --> 01:42:13.573]  Pol Pot.
[01:42:13.573 --> 01:42:15.314]  How did Pol Pot start?
[01:42:15.314 --> 01:42:17.775]  A little tiny guy in Cambodia.
[01:42:17.775 --> 01:42:19.936]  He went to Paris to study Marxism.
[01:42:19.936 --> 01:42:21.837]  He became enthralled with Marxism.
[01:42:21.837 --> 01:42:24.098]  He came back and introduced Marxism in Cambodia.
[01:42:24.716 --> 01:42:27.118]  He put together the 13-year-olds, the 14-year-olds.
[01:42:27.118 --> 01:42:28.980]  He gave them the red bandanas.
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:30.461]  He called them the Red Brigades.
[01:42:30.461 --> 01:42:32.022]  What did the Red Brigades do?
[01:42:32.022 --> 01:42:33.643]  The Khmer Rouge.
[01:42:33.643 --> 01:42:36.826]  They went and they started by humiliating the middle class.
[01:42:36.826 --> 01:42:37.707]  Their own race now.
[01:42:38.832 --> 01:42:42.614]  Doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects... Hold on, do one more segment.
[01:42:42.614 --> 01:42:55.102]  Explain the process of how they get a group ready to be exterminated, and you see it again, exactly being followed formulaically, and then you hear the Weathermen and others saying, we're gonna round up the Christians and Conservatives, we're gonna kill you!
[01:42:56.445 --> 01:43:01.187]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[01:43:54.441 --> 01:44:10.269]  I'm driving home here, about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving, and I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am.
[01:44:10.269 --> 01:44:14.351]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action,
[01:44:15.137 --> 01:44:20.562]  And if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other nations.
[01:44:20.562 --> 01:44:34.954]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control society.
[01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:41.041]  And that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide, but the enemy's tracking back.
[01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:52.030]  So just please, we should all be so thankful to God and thankful to each other for taking action, but also girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening.
[01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:54.672]  So for myself and my family, God bless you all.
[01:44:54.672 --> 01:44:57.955]  Have a great Thanksgiving.
[01:44:57.955 --> 01:45:03.780]  I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding our operation by purchasing products,
[01:45:07.809 --> 01:45:09.090]  We don't have corporate sponsors.
[01:45:09.090 --> 01:45:10.532]  We don't have globalist funding.
[01:45:10.532 --> 01:45:12.353]  We're funded by patriots like you.
[01:45:12.353 --> 01:45:26.626]  And we also, of course, provide high quality products to make it easy to support yourself and to support us, symbiotically, as we try to retake this country and the planet and heal the population that's been under globalist engineering.
[01:45:27.246 --> 01:45:32.689]  That said, we're running biggest specials ever, every single year, during Black Friday.
[01:45:32.689 --> 01:45:35.091]  And this year is even better than last year.
[01:45:35.091 --> 01:45:38.072]  We've got free shipping, store-wide, on everything.
[01:45:38.072 --> 01:45:42.295]  We've got huge sales, like Rainforest, 50% off.

[01:45:49.819 --> 01:45:51.319]  That's unprecedented.

[01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:55.642]  So check it out today.
[01:45:57.302 --> 01:46:00.446]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:46:00.446 --> 01:46:07.873]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[01:46:07.873 --> 01:46:13.419]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:46:14.236 --> 01:46:21.904]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:46:21.904 --> 01:46:29.752]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:46:30.513 --> 01:46:35.577]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:46:35.577 --> 01:46:37.698]  They are the anti-liberal.
[01:46:37.698 --> 01:46:51.087]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:51.087 --> 01:46:55.070]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:58.268 --> 01:47:00.885]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.942 --> 01:47:29.429]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:47:29.429 --> 01:47:33.793]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:33.793 --> 01:47:37.976]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:47:37.976 --> 01:47:39.578]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:40.527 --> 01:47:42.188]  That's right, it's an information war.
[01:47:42.188 --> 01:47:51.074]  I go out in downtown Austin, downtown San Francisco, downtown areas of Upper West Side, New York, Seattle.
[01:47:51.074 --> 01:47:58.339]  People punch me, they throw coffee at me, they slap me in the back of the head, they come up behind me and knock my foot over and just say, F you Nazi!
[01:47:59.597 --> 01:48:03.863]  And then their behavior is so Nazi-like in the stages of authoritarianism.
[01:48:03.863 --> 01:48:10.753]  First they yell at you, then they attack you, then they shut your business down, then they make you live in a ghetto, then they haul you off to prison.
[01:48:10.753 --> 01:48:12.636]  And Michael Savage was getting into the left.
[01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:25.930]  They're authoritarianism, and all over the news, hashtag hunt Republicans, and Rand Paul being tackled and attacked, and Republican members of city councils being shot in the face by their neighbors, and Congressman Scalise, and on and on.
[01:48:25.930 --> 01:48:26.890]  They're getting violent.
[01:48:26.890 --> 01:48:28.710]  They want violence.
[01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:38.252]  They're pushing it, and you were getting, historically, with the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia, and the Pol Pot, the killing fields, as an example, but it always basically follows the same formula.
[01:48:38.252 --> 01:48:41.253]  Please continue with that historic warning, Dr. Savage.
[01:48:41.901 --> 01:48:43.544]  I will, but I want to say something.
[01:48:43.544 --> 01:48:47.509]  The book God, Faith, and Reason is a very benign looking book, isn't it, Michael?
[01:48:47.509 --> 01:48:48.290]  Let's say you don't know me.
[01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:49.992]  You see this in a bookstore.
[01:48:49.992 --> 01:48:53.457]  Nice old guy, God, Faith, and Reason.
[01:48:53.457 --> 01:48:57.823]  If people took this to work and put it on their desks, let's see how tolerant
[01:48:58.988 --> 01:49:04.631]  The left is, from a benign book such as this, which is almost apolitical, okay?
[01:49:04.631 --> 01:49:07.293]  Let's just see it as a little billboard on a desk at work.
[01:49:07.293 --> 01:49:09.434]  Pol Pot, Cambodia.
[01:49:09.434 --> 01:49:15.738]  Nice professor goes to Paris, studies Marxism, comes back and says, I want to introduce that economic system.
[01:49:16.468 --> 01:49:23.853]  So he introduces it, then he hires 12, 13, 14 year old boys and girls, gives them the Khmer Rouge, the red scarf.
[01:49:23.853 --> 01:49:25.954]  He tells them to go out and humiliate the teachers.
[01:49:25.954 --> 01:49:32.499]  Anyone who could read or write, anyone who was literate in Cambodia, was targeted by the Marxists.
[01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:32.959]  Didn't matter.
[01:49:32.959 --> 01:49:34.700]  All one race, remember that.
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:38.623]  Teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, accountants, didn't matter.
[01:49:38.623 --> 01:49:44.166]  Any literate person was first humiliated, personally humiliated in the street like you're being yelled at.
[01:49:44.166 --> 01:49:44.987]  That's how it starts.
[01:49:46.688 --> 01:49:51.534]  And the thugs, the Khmer Rouge, then work them in the fields and kill them.
[01:49:51.534 --> 01:49:53.777]  Now we had the Mountain of Skulls.
[01:49:53.777 --> 01:49:54.959]  That's what communism brings.
[01:49:56.030 --> 01:50:04.416]  That's what Rachel Madcow, Wolf Blitzer, and company will bring to this country unless they are taught who they are and what they're doing to this nation.
[01:50:04.416 --> 01:50:10.540]  They may not actually think they want that to happen, but they will lead to a mountain of skulls unless they are reined in.
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:20.286]  Somebody has to explain to these sub-morons, these sub-intellectuals, these pseudo-intellectuals, these uneducated dolts, that things start with an idea.
[01:50:21.115 --> 01:50:21.976]  Okay?
[01:50:21.976 --> 01:50:24.278]  Now, you see in this country, who's the Khmer Rouge?
[01:50:24.278 --> 01:50:24.938]  Do we have it?
[01:50:24.938 --> 01:50:25.919]  Of course we have it!
[01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:26.660]  The Antifa!
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:28.641]  The Democratic Party!
[01:50:28.641 --> 01:50:30.483]  How about Ferguson, Missouri?
[01:50:30.483 --> 01:50:31.764]  How about Baltimore, Maryland?
[01:50:31.764 --> 01:50:33.105]  What was that?
[01:50:33.105 --> 01:50:34.446]  There was a reason for Ferguson?
[01:50:34.446 --> 01:50:35.347]  Burning a city down?
[01:50:35.347 --> 01:50:36.507]  Attacking police?
[01:50:36.507 --> 01:50:37.448]  The killing of police?
[01:50:37.448 --> 01:50:39.070]  The war against police?
[01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:44.474]  This is all part of the same Khmer Rouge effect in the United States of America.
[01:50:44.474 --> 01:50:48.097]  They couch it under the guise of only certain lives matter.
[01:50:48.097 --> 01:50:50.659]  They use race as a shield and a spear.
[01:50:51.621 --> 01:50:56.765]  To silence those of us who see who they are, but never forget their end.
[01:50:56.765 --> 01:50:59.607]  They have said point-blank what they want to do.
[01:50:59.607 --> 01:51:01.408]  They want to kill 30 million Americans.
[01:51:01.408 --> 01:51:03.250]  I read this in the 60s, Alex.
[01:51:03.250 --> 01:51:05.231]  This is nothing new.
[01:51:05.231 --> 01:51:06.532]  I forget the name of the group.
[01:51:06.532 --> 01:51:07.253]  He's still alive.
[01:51:07.253 --> 01:51:08.894]  He's Obama's good friend there in Chicago.
[01:51:08.894 --> 01:51:12.176]  Yeah, that's the weatherman that Bill Ayers said... Thank you.
[01:51:12.176 --> 01:51:15.619]  Bill Ayers was a member of a group that said if we kill 30 million Americans,
[01:51:16.471 --> 01:51:18.213]  We'll be able to save America.
[01:51:18.213 --> 01:51:19.975]  Don't think that they still don't want to do it.
[01:51:19.975 --> 01:51:23.539]  Well, our population's doubled since then, so it'd be 60 million.
[01:51:23.539 --> 01:51:27.663]  Well, about the number that was killed in other countries under that kind of psychosis.
[01:51:27.663 --> 01:51:32.709]  So if it's kill or be killed, people better take the proper steps to protect themselves.
[01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:34.971]  Last February, I was attacked outside a restaurant.
[01:51:34.971 --> 01:51:36.012]  Remember that story?
[01:51:36.012 --> 01:51:36.193]  Yes.
[01:51:37.205 --> 01:51:38.006]  Okay.
[01:51:38.006 --> 01:51:39.106]  I mean, I'm an older guy.
[01:51:39.106 --> 01:51:40.507]  I didn't pick a fight.
[01:51:40.507 --> 01:51:42.689]  I was sitting there with my dog having two drinks.
[01:51:42.689 --> 01:51:43.730]  People came to like me.
[01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:44.230]  We talked.
[01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:45.491]  And some guy was on the end of a bar.
[01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:46.271]  Older guy.
[01:51:46.271 --> 01:51:47.472]  I didn't say one word to him.
[01:51:47.472 --> 01:51:48.053]  I didn't even look at him.
[01:51:48.053 --> 01:51:49.113]  I didn't know who he was.
[01:51:49.113 --> 01:51:51.595]  I walk out of the restaurant.
[01:51:51.595 --> 01:51:52.236]  I turn around.
[01:51:52.236 --> 01:51:53.517]  There he is looming over me.
[01:51:53.517 --> 01:51:54.237]  20 years younger.
[01:51:54.237 --> 01:51:54.938]  A foot taller.
[01:51:54.938 --> 01:51:55.878]  One thing led to another.
[01:51:55.878 --> 01:51:56.719]  I wound up on my ass.
[01:51:57.922 --> 01:52:00.783]  Luckily, I didn't die, I didn't break my skull.
[01:52:00.783 --> 01:52:03.844]  The dog got scared to death, the poor little teddy was shaking like a leaf.
[01:52:03.844 --> 01:52:11.848]  Rand Paul had six broken ribs and a punctured lung, and then now he's come out and said, no, the neighbor hates me, he's a leftist, and the media's making excuses for it.
[01:52:11.848 --> 01:52:15.129]  He tackled him and then started stomping him in his yard.
[01:52:15.129 --> 01:52:15.809]  Unbelievable.
[01:52:15.809 --> 01:52:17.330]  This guy should be charged with murder.
[01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:18.050]  First of all, he's a U.S.
[01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:18.350]  Senator.
[01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:20.211]  How come he had no Secret Service?
[01:52:20.211 --> 01:52:22.332]  Dianne Feinstein has Secret Service?
[01:52:22.332 --> 01:52:23.092]  Wait a minute.
[01:52:23.092 --> 01:52:24.492]  Why doesn't he have any Secret Service?
[01:52:24.492 --> 01:52:25.653]  It only applies to the leftists?
[01:52:26.644 --> 01:52:27.725]  Well, let's put that aside.
[01:52:27.725 --> 01:52:28.465]  We're all at risk right now.
[01:52:28.465 --> 01:52:30.947]  Conservatives and people are just too regular.
[01:52:30.947 --> 01:52:33.408]  He was mowing his own yard.
[01:52:33.408 --> 01:52:34.609]  Well, that's a terrible story.
[01:52:34.609 --> 01:52:35.990]  He could have been killed.
[01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:42.694]  But the point of my being knocked to the ground was, who protected me at that time from getting killed, hurt, banging my head, breaking my ribs?
[01:52:42.694 --> 01:52:43.394]  I'm an older guy.
[01:52:43.394 --> 01:52:45.555]  How come I didn't break anything?
[01:52:45.555 --> 01:52:49.938]  Alex, I'm going to tell this story on the air today several times in my life, and I'm not tempting fate.
[01:52:49.938 --> 01:52:53.420]  God knows I'm not tempting fate.
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:54.521]  I've seen a hand come down.
[01:52:55.945 --> 01:52:58.828]  A hand came down, cushioned the blow.
[01:52:58.828 --> 01:53:01.070]  It could be the push-ups I do at night.
[01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:04.213]  It could be a lifetime of very clean living.
[01:53:04.213 --> 01:53:06.035]  That's a joke.
[01:53:06.035 --> 01:53:09.438]  But nothing broke.
[01:53:09.438 --> 01:53:19.568]  I was in Fiji 30, 40 years ago, and I was a plant collector looking for medicinal plants way ahead of all of the people who think they know this field right now.
[01:53:19.568 --> 01:53:20.249]  Plant collector.
[01:53:21.028 --> 01:53:22.829]  One night, we're drinking kava kava all night.
[01:53:22.829 --> 01:53:23.950]  I wanted to leave the village.
[01:53:23.950 --> 01:53:28.053]  All of my Melanesian friends, they're black people in the islands.
[01:53:28.053 --> 01:53:33.057]  They used to look at me when we drank a lot of kava, and they'd say to me, in Fiji, and I think he's Fijian, they'd look at my eyes.
[01:53:33.057 --> 01:53:36.580]  I guess that was a transracial thing at the time.
[01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:37.140]  They loved me.
[01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:38.961]  I loved them.
[01:53:38.961 --> 01:53:41.463]  All of a sudden, in the middle of this kava drinking, I had an instinct.
[01:53:41.463 --> 01:53:43.805]  I wanted to leave that village.
[01:53:43.805 --> 01:53:46.307]  I said, so my friend Dominico said, don't go, don't go, don't go.
[01:53:46.307 --> 01:53:46.947]  I said, I have to go.
[01:53:46.947 --> 01:53:48.128]  He said, I can't go right now, man.
[01:53:48.128 --> 01:53:49.189]  We've been drinking this all night.
[01:53:49.893 --> 01:53:50.874]  I said, I gotta get out of here.
[01:53:50.874 --> 01:53:53.815]  So I go, I walk in the dark along an edge.
[01:53:53.815 --> 01:53:55.556]  I go back to my other village.
[01:53:55.556 --> 01:53:57.758]  The next morning he comes to me, he was like shaken.
[01:53:57.758 --> 01:53:59.298]  He said, come back with me.
[01:53:59.298 --> 01:54:01.560]  I want you to see what you walked on.
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:06.783]  He said, you were walking on a path that fell about 500 feet to the sea.
[01:54:06.783 --> 01:54:11.405]  It was six inches wide, this little path that you were on, and you didn't fall.
[01:54:11.405 --> 01:54:16.168]  I look back on that moment, and I have to say to you, I think that God put me here for a reason.
[01:54:16.906 --> 01:54:20.787]  And I think the reason is the sinquanon of God, faith, and reason.
[01:54:20.787 --> 01:54:25.148]  I believe this book could be the one that reaches to those who have left God.
[01:54:25.148 --> 01:54:29.029]  And again, it's not a book to bring you to a church, or a synagogue, or a temple.
[01:54:29.029 --> 01:54:31.130]  It's a book to bring you to yourself.
[01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:33.430]  Because in looking for God, you'll find yourself.
[01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:35.231]  People don't know who they are today.
[01:54:35.231 --> 01:54:44.553]  You'll throw away the drugs, you'll throw away all the crutches, you'll throw away the beads, you'll throw away the dream catchers, you'll throw away your evil leftism, and you just might find
[01:54:45.327 --> 01:54:47.308]  That God might be your salvation.
[01:54:47.308 --> 01:54:53.332]  Because, believe me, as I sit here, there's a reason for everything, and God is above all of us.
[01:54:53.332 --> 01:54:58.015]  As Rocky Graziano, the great middleweight fighter, said, somebody up there likes me.
[01:54:58.015 --> 01:54:59.976]  And I hope that somebody up there likes you, Alec.
[01:54:59.976 --> 01:55:01.977]  And I hope somebody up there likes me.
[01:55:01.977 --> 01:55:11.663]  And I hope somebody up there really still likes America, despite what we have done to ourselves, by permitting this virus of left-wing fascism to take over the country.
[01:55:11.663 --> 01:55:13.124]  Well, I think you've hit the heart here.
[01:55:13.124 --> 01:55:14.945]  It's not just that liberalism is a mental illness.
[01:55:15.936 --> 01:55:22.861]  Liberals hate God, and they hate existing success, and they don't want to join with it, even though we're not trying to make them.
[01:55:22.861 --> 01:55:23.962]  We have free will.
[01:55:23.962 --> 01:55:32.988]  They don't like that we made some of the better free will discussions and some of the better free will choices in our life, and they don't like free will and want to force us
[01:55:33.288 --> 01:55:35.490]  Look at all the major inventions of the world.
[01:55:35.490 --> 01:55:37.032]  Trains, cars, planes, telegraph, computers.
[01:55:58.613 --> 01:55:59.913]  Medical advances.
[01:55:59.913 --> 01:56:04.715]  I'm sorry to break the news to all of those out there who don't want to know the news.
[01:56:04.715 --> 01:56:08.236]  All invented by dead white males.
[01:56:08.236 --> 01:56:10.416]  You want to make it real down home here?
[01:56:10.416 --> 01:56:12.177]  I can name one invention after the other.
[01:56:12.177 --> 01:56:14.997]  Almost all of them invented by dead white males.
[01:56:14.997 --> 01:56:21.659]  Now it is true that thousands of years ago, or a thousand years ago actually, China was more advanced than any country on earth.
[01:56:21.659 --> 01:56:24.120]  Six masted sailing ships, coal mines,
[01:56:24.861 --> 01:56:27.342]  And do you know when those advancements in China came to an end?
[01:56:27.342 --> 01:56:29.082]  When the mandarins took over.
[01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:30.502]  Who were the mandarins at that time?
[01:56:30.502 --> 01:56:34.323]  The mandarins were the central government types, the long fingernails.
[01:56:34.323 --> 01:56:38.224]  They sat up there in the Washington DC of China and they controlled everyone's life.
[01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:40.744]  They killed all creativity, all inventiveness in China.
[01:56:40.744 --> 01:56:46.046]  We'd already be out of the solar system with Mars bases if the mandarins hadn't taken over.
[01:56:46.046 --> 01:56:46.526]  That's right.
[01:56:46.526 --> 01:56:50.266]  So the mandarins are now trying to take over again through the media.
[01:56:50.266 --> 01:56:51.407]  The mandarins are right there.
[01:56:51.407 --> 01:56:52.587]  Jake Tapper, mandarin.
[01:56:53.108 --> 01:56:53.769]  Wolfie Blitzen.
[01:56:53.769 --> 01:56:54.530]  Legalist.
[01:56:54.530 --> 01:56:57.074]  Mandarin, Mandarin, Mandarin, Mandarin, Mandarin.
[01:56:57.074 --> 01:56:58.277]  I'm not talking about Mandarin Orange.
[01:56:58.277 --> 01:57:01.302]  They're control-free cultists, a new dark age, they want to run everything.
[01:57:01.969 --> 01:57:03.150]  Very dangerous people.
[01:57:03.150 --> 01:57:04.770]  Never forget who the enemy is.
[01:57:04.770 --> 01:57:05.551]  They have names.
[01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:06.891]  They have faces.
[01:57:06.891 --> 01:57:08.452]  Never forget who they are.
[01:57:08.452 --> 01:57:15.735]  They are the intellectual avant-garde that will lead to the mountain of skulls unless they're called out and spit upon verbally and intellectually.
[01:57:15.735 --> 01:57:17.176]  That's all I want to say about it.
[01:57:17.176 --> 01:57:21.537]  You know, at a certain time, you got to roll your sleeves up and get down in the gutter and not be so intellectual about it.
[01:57:21.537 --> 01:57:22.718]  These people are out for blood.
[01:57:24.065 --> 01:57:26.586]  Michael Savage, thank you for giving us a whole hour.
[01:57:26.586 --> 01:57:27.467]  I know you're a very busy guy.
[01:57:27.467 --> 01:57:29.408]  Your show's coming up in one hour.
[01:57:29.408 --> 01:57:30.589]  michaelsavage.com.
[01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:32.750]  The new book, God, Faith, and Reason.
[01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:34.731]  And folks, get my new t-shirt at infowarstore.com.
[01:57:34.731 --> 01:57:36.252]  That's how we fund ourselves as well.
[01:57:36.252 --> 01:57:38.493]  The new Don't Tread on Me, pre-shipped and store-wide.
[01:57:38.493 --> 01:57:39.414]  Thank you, Michael.
[01:57:39.414 --> 01:57:40.014]  You're amazing.
[01:57:40.014 --> 01:57:40.794]  Thank you for all you're doing.
[01:57:40.794 --> 01:57:42.235]  I can't wait to read the book.
[01:57:42.235 --> 01:57:43.136]  God bless, Alex.
[01:57:43.136 --> 01:57:43.876]  Thank you.
[01:57:43.876 --> 01:57:44.957]  We need God, absolutely.
[01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:45.417]  God bless you.
[01:57:51.596 --> 01:57:56.560]  Keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:05.346]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:58:05.346 --> 01:58:10.369]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[01:58:12.931 --> 01:58:18.554]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[01:58:18.554 --> 01:58:21.556]  Secret 12, optimal absorption.
[01:58:21.556 --> 01:58:26.719]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[01:58:26.719 --> 01:58:31.882]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[01:58:31.882 --> 01:58:32.622]  Optimum levels.
[01:58:34.043 --> 01:58:38.204]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[01:58:38.204 --> 01:58:42.806]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.

[01:59:49.259 --> 01:59:51.901]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:56.465 --> 01:59:58.206]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:58.206 --> 02:00:00.406]  Thanksgiving.
[02:00:00.406 --> 02:00:03.948]  One of the few true Americana holidays that we've got.
[02:00:03.948 --> 02:00:06.328]  Probably my favorite holiday.
[02:00:06.328 --> 02:00:09.169]  The 23rd day of November 2017.
[02:00:09.169 --> 02:00:15.051]  We've seen total demonization of the Italian Christopher Columbus.
[02:00:15.051 --> 02:00:17.412]  We've seen the total demonization of Thanksgiving.
[02:00:17.412 --> 02:00:21.534]  We've seen attempts to get rid of the holiday.
[02:00:21.534 --> 02:00:22.274]  To use it to
[02:00:23.254 --> 02:00:30.616]  Gas dispersions on Western civilization and Western expansion that undoubtedly was a mess.
[02:00:30.616 --> 02:00:32.836]  And there were crimes on all sides.
[02:00:32.836 --> 02:00:42.239]  When I say all sides, it wasn't just the settlers, or it wasn't just the troops, or it wasn't just the empires, or it wasn't just all the different native tribes.
[02:00:42.239 --> 02:00:52.081]  It was all of those different countless changing factions that played into this long before white men were colonized.
[02:00:53.681 --> 02:00:59.986]  North America, the Vikings certainly visited it for a thousand years before Christopher Columbus supposedly discovered it.
[02:00:59.986 --> 02:01:02.387]  That's now documented.
[02:01:02.387 --> 02:01:17.178]  But long before white men ever colonized it, all the native tribes did was run around and try to dominate and control each other and take over and kill the men and then take the women and the children.
[02:01:17.856 --> 02:01:21.358]  The same stuff that was going on in Europe for 10,000 years.
[02:01:21.358 --> 02:01:24.360]  Same stuff going on in Africa for 10,000 years.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:27.761]  Same stuff going on everywhere in the world.
[02:01:27.761 --> 02:01:30.563]  Humans acted the same.
[02:01:30.563 --> 02:01:39.648]  And so, we never see big pieces being done on the bad things that the Native Americans did, or the way they behaved.
[02:01:39.648 --> 02:01:43.430]  Because it's not part of the liberation theology.
[02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:47.172]  Starting in the 50s, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment,
[02:01:47.774 --> 02:01:57.209]  Created Liberation Theology where they thought that Jesus would have fought back and was a revolutionary and hated capitalism and was a communist.
[02:02:00.163 --> 02:02:07.046]  The different populations that were Christian, poor, black, Hispanic, you name it, to become liberation theologists.
[02:02:07.046 --> 02:02:08.107]  And that was just one part of it.
[02:02:08.107 --> 02:02:28.196]  But to teach that in the schools to everybody that America was bad, the founders were bad, this was an undermining of the nation-state and our ethos, where we came from, so that people of color particularly wouldn't have a idea in their head that they had a right to the American birthright, or that they'd been part
[02:02:28.991 --> 02:02:31.952]  Critical parts of this great saga.
[02:02:31.952 --> 02:02:32.652]  No.
[02:02:32.652 --> 02:02:36.754]  It's all just, you were good, but you were exploited, and the whites were bad.
[02:02:36.754 --> 02:02:48.198]  When it was way more complex, with whites that were indentured servants, and bounties, and people basically as slaves, and company stores, and sharecroppers.
[02:02:48.198 --> 02:02:51.559]  But they just continue to play on the incredible ignorance of the public.
[02:02:51.559 --> 02:02:56.801]  The last few weeks, CNN claims they've broken the news that there's slave auctions in Libya.
[02:02:56.801 --> 02:02:57.681]  Broken the news?
[02:02:59.196 --> 02:03:06.343]  In seven different Muslim countries, they sell women on top slave blocks, you know, up on a stage.
[02:03:06.343 --> 02:03:07.204]  And it's all known.
[02:03:07.204 --> 02:03:08.485]  It's Muslims doing it.
[02:03:08.485 --> 02:03:17.514]  But all these reports from CNN breaking, you know, this supposed news that we've been talking about forever and others have been documenting.
[02:03:17.514 --> 02:03:21.959]  It's about, oh, the poor migrants, the poor babies, the poor, the poor migrants.
[02:03:21.959 --> 02:03:23.020]  These are people in Africa.
[02:03:23.826 --> 02:03:32.569]  That are being kidnapped and grabbed and sold into slavery by Muslims, but somehow they turn it into quote Muslims by using the term migrant.
[02:03:32.569 --> 02:03:36.551]  That's the new definition of Muslims is a migrant, never a Muslim invader.
[02:03:36.551 --> 02:03:43.393]  So they take Muslims of slaving people and then turn it into the catch all word of poor little Muslims, which is migrant.
[02:03:45.001 --> 02:03:47.642]  So they know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:47.642 --> 02:03:50.463]  But we're going to be covering that a lot more here during the transmission.
[02:03:50.463 --> 02:03:53.604]  But I'm proud of Thanksgiving, and I give thanks to you, the audience.
[02:03:53.604 --> 02:03:54.544]  Thanks to God.
[02:03:54.544 --> 02:03:55.365]  Thanks to my family.
[02:03:55.365 --> 02:03:57.265]  Thanks to the great crew.
[02:03:57.265 --> 02:03:59.386]  And I just want to thank you all for what you've done.
[02:03:59.386 --> 02:04:03.107]  We have extended the specials from earlier in the week, as we planned to do.
[02:04:03.107 --> 02:04:05.548]  But we have new specials that are added each day.
[02:04:05.548 --> 02:04:08.629]  And X2 is 50% off.
[02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:10.370]  Super high quality.
[02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:11.450]  Just absolutely
[02:04:12.773 --> 02:04:13.073]  Needed!
[02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:32.257]  A bunch of stuff is there.
[02:04:32.257 --> 02:04:33.578]  Biggest sales ever.
[02:04:33.578 --> 02:04:39.202]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:04:39.202 --> 02:04:41.885]  Again, I want to thank you all for what you've done.
[02:04:41.885 --> 02:04:45.928]  I want to thank you all for your victory, breaking your conditioning against the globalists.
[02:04:45.928 --> 02:04:55.255]  I want to encourage you all to keep supporting the broadcast by purchasing high-quality products at Infowarsstore.com, which is a win-win for everybody because they're high-quality, and it helps fund this operation.
[02:04:55.255 --> 02:04:56.436]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:56.436 --> 02:05:00.619]  I'm driving home here, about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving.
[02:05:02.322 --> 02:05:09.425]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am.
[02:05:09.425 --> 02:05:19.809]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action, and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other nations.
[02:05:19.809 --> 02:05:29.273]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure
[02:05:30.609 --> 02:05:35.191]  Power, cult, will to dominate and control society.
[02:05:35.191 --> 02:05:40.292]  And that we have come so far with God's help, and have turned the tide, but the enemy's tracking back.
[02:05:40.292 --> 02:05:46.134]  So just, please, we should all be so thankful to God, and thankful to each other for taking action.
[02:05:46.134 --> 02:05:51.276]  But also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead, because history is happening.
[02:05:51.276 --> 02:05:53.937]  So for myself, and my family, God bless you all.
[02:05:53.937 --> 02:05:54.737]  Have a great Thanksgiving.
[02:06:13.098 --> 02:06:19.604]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:06:19.604 --> 02:06:21.145]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:53.251 --> 02:06:55.813]  Candace Owens, red-pulled-black, just set me on fire.
[02:06:55.813 --> 02:07:19.709]  I wanted to kick into that again when I talked about the type of person Trump is, and how he's a fighter, and how he went to Scotland for six months, about a year before he decided to run, or before he announced it, and he made the decision not to do it for his family, and then he felt so guilty that he basically envisioned the whole thing, winning, how they'd make fun of him, what they'd do, what would unfold.
[02:07:20.786 --> 02:07:34.589]  And I was told this by Roger Stone, who talked to Trump about it at length, was the head of his campaign at first, and then later in Politico, there was this whole article about how Trump did it.
[02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:43.731]  And it had some of the same stuff from Bannon and others about what Trump did, and he's very fatalistic.
[02:07:43.731 --> 02:07:47.552]  That's why he'll walk without the Secret Service, and he just says, I don't care, stand down.
[02:07:49.167 --> 02:07:50.528]  Does it want to die?
[02:07:50.528 --> 02:07:55.731]  But if somebody kills him, then he knows we'll win even bigger.
[02:07:55.731 --> 02:07:57.652]  It's something else, folks.
[02:07:57.652 --> 02:07:59.613]  I mean, Trump's the real warrior.
[02:07:59.613 --> 02:08:01.094]  The real deal.
[02:08:01.094 --> 02:08:03.835]  And I'll tell you, I know the other behind-the-scenes stuff.
[02:08:03.835 --> 02:08:04.996]  He's not a racist, in fact.
[02:08:05.792 --> 02:08:06.433]  It's the opposite.
[02:08:06.433 --> 02:08:10.880]  I'm not going to be patronizing about it and say Donald Trump really likes black people, but he does.
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:13.663]  Because he likes people that are optimistic, energy strong.
[02:08:13.663 --> 02:08:14.825]  He loves everybody.
[02:08:14.825 --> 02:08:17.589]  Unless you're trying to dominate him, then he wants to dominate you.
[02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:20.152]  And who he wants to dominate is the bullies.
[02:08:20.152 --> 02:08:22.536]  He wants to set America loose, folks.
[02:08:23.437 --> 02:08:24.597]  And he got screwed over.
[02:08:24.597 --> 02:08:26.138]  His dad came from nowhere.
[02:08:26.138 --> 02:08:31.420]  Their family had to fight in New York in the middle of that with a mob and everything to be builders, and they won.
[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:33.740]  You don't think they didn't do some stuff behind the scenes?
[02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:34.701]  Let folks know to leave them alone?
[02:08:34.701 --> 02:08:38.162]  I mean, the Trumps are fighters, folks, and the globalists.
[02:08:38.562 --> 02:08:40.044]  Are scared of him.
[02:08:40.044 --> 02:08:40.444]  It's real.
[02:08:40.444 --> 02:08:42.206]  Does it mean he's not co-opting them?
[02:08:42.206 --> 02:08:44.288]  Does it mean he doesn't do everything perfect?
[02:08:44.288 --> 02:08:48.032]  He's getting the best done he can, and that's why they're so scared.
[02:08:48.032 --> 02:08:50.815]  And I'm not gonna go over all the accomplishments, but you just set me on fire there.
[02:08:50.815 --> 02:08:56.641]  Spend a few minutes about this conference, hearing Bannon speak, who this woman was you saw speak, talking about what other countries are like.
[02:08:56.641 --> 02:09:01.486]  Because let me tell you, you go to some other countries, folks, especially third world countries or other stuff, and you learn real quick
[02:09:01.966 --> 02:09:06.111]  What authoritarianism is, what bondage is, what people giving up is.
[02:09:06.111 --> 02:09:14.360]  And then you understand, now I see why the globalist fashion America so much, because it's got ideas that ever implemented bring down their global system.
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:17.163]  Doesn't mean we don't have sins, doesn't mean we don't have big problems!
[02:09:17.643 --> 02:09:27.026]  The difference is we've had these experiences together, and we've got an idea that Martin Luther King talked about that is the American dream that we never really realized is unlimited.
[02:09:27.026 --> 02:09:30.847]  Just 10% getting realized that it's the richest country in the world!
[02:09:30.847 --> 02:09:33.768]  We had half the world's wealth until about a decade ago.
[02:09:33.768 --> 02:09:36.069]  And it's because we were creating the wealth.
[02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:41.471]  So get back into this conference, Who You Heard Speak, give us the details, Candace, Red Pill Black.
[02:09:41.471 --> 02:09:42.291]  It's not over yet.
[02:09:42.291 --> 02:09:45.392]  I can just tell you that this is the most amazing thing, and I
[02:09:46.886 --> 02:09:47.286]  I think so.
[02:10:10.117 --> 02:10:11.779]  You punch back and you keep going.
[02:10:11.779 --> 02:10:13.080]  And you keep doing what you do.
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:14.561]  You punch back and you keep going.
[02:10:14.561 --> 02:10:20.107]  And that has been the mentality and the theme of this counter-resistance, which is a David Horowitz event.
[02:10:20.107 --> 02:10:21.248]  He does it once a year.
[02:10:21.248 --> 02:10:34.441]  And he really pulls everybody that is on the front lines, everyone that is getting killed by the press, killed by people in the community that are lying about them, smearing them when they're just trying to do the right patriotic thing to do for this country.
[02:10:34.861 --> 02:10:37.604]  Katie Hopkins, if you don't know her, she's a British reporter.
[02:10:37.604 --> 02:10:38.965]  She's huge, absolutely massive.
[02:10:38.965 --> 02:10:41.428]  She writes for the Daily Mail.
[02:10:41.428 --> 02:10:43.149]  She's the one that writes all those pieces.
[02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:46.092]  And her speech, I mean, I almost brought tears to my eyes.
[02:10:46.092 --> 02:10:48.014]  I mean, everyone was on their feet.
[02:10:48.014 --> 02:10:51.077]  Just a round of applause, standing ovation for her.
[02:10:51.077 --> 02:10:54.501]  She was so funny and so quirky in a way that, you know, only the Brits can do.
[02:10:55.021 --> 02:10:58.643]  Milo's gonna be speaking, Anne's gonna be speaking, Gavin McInnes up there.
[02:10:58.643 --> 02:11:00.503]  I mean, I don't think I've laughed harder.
[02:11:00.503 --> 02:11:05.145]  He's like, he could be a stand-up comedian, and he's just talking about... Well, he used to be a stand-up comedian.
[02:11:05.145 --> 02:11:06.886]  He got banned.
[02:11:06.886 --> 02:11:12.228]  He got blacklisted because he became a libertarian.
[02:11:12.228 --> 02:11:21.652]  Yeah, well, and he's just telling the story about how he was at the Deplora Ball, and he just punched somebody back, and that sort of is, that is symbolic of what it is that we're talking about.
[02:11:21.652 --> 02:11:24.593]  And they can't stand the fact that we're finally punching back!
[02:11:25.302 --> 02:11:27.323]  Yeah, they don't know what to do, and he says that.
[02:11:27.323 --> 02:11:30.064]  He says the person made a face, and they just couldn't believe it, Alex.
[02:11:30.064 --> 02:11:34.066]  They couldn't believe that they were getting punched back, you know, because they saw them.
[02:11:34.066 --> 02:11:37.728]  They have just been the bullies, and they have been punching us, and they've been saying, this is what you are.
[02:11:37.728 --> 02:11:38.689]  They tell me, you're a coon.
[02:11:38.689 --> 02:11:39.709]  You're Uncle Tom.
[02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:40.370]  You're a doctor.
[02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:43.651]  You're this and you're that, and I'm saying, I'm not going to take it sitting down, okay?
[02:11:43.651 --> 02:11:44.832]  We are the counter-resistance.
[02:11:44.832 --> 02:11:49.154]  We are here, and Steve Bannon, when he talked about Trump and his fighting spirit and how he met him,
[02:11:49.574 --> 02:11:52.615]  And everyone here is telling their experiences.
[02:11:52.615 --> 02:11:57.938]  There's a double amputee who is, I believe, the congressman in Florida.
[02:11:57.938 --> 02:12:01.379]  You know, he fought for this country, lost his legs, and now he's a congressman.
[02:12:01.379 --> 02:12:06.441]  He is talking to us, telling us about how patriotic he is and how he wants to help this country.
[02:12:06.441 --> 02:12:09.563]  And meanwhile, Colin Kaepernick is on the cover for GQ.
[02:12:10.163 --> 02:12:18.570]  Okay, he's on the cover for an outstanding... And it looks so stupid when you see the covers with Colbert and all of them propped up.
[02:12:18.570 --> 02:12:19.491]  It's embarrassing.
[02:12:19.491 --> 02:12:22.033]  I wouldn't be on the cover of GQ if they asked me now.
[02:12:22.033 --> 02:12:23.514]  I wouldn't make a Peace Prize now.
[02:12:23.514 --> 02:12:25.736]  It's all... They don't get what jokes they are.
[02:12:26.653 --> 02:12:36.860]  It's such a joke, but when you look at this guy who's got two prosthetic legs and he is still fighting for this country as a congressman, and you feel the energy in that room when he spoke.
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:43.065]  And by the way, he's the same congressman that went in when they wouldn't put up even three, four months in Trump's picture at the VA in Florida, remember?
[02:12:44.002 --> 02:12:55.732]  Right, yes, yeah, he is just, this man, okay, is amazing, okay, and I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this man is and how he can move the room and his experience with his fighting spirit.
[02:12:55.732 --> 02:13:00.576]  It is that fighting spirit, that is what David Horowitz was able to curate with this weekend.
[02:13:00.576 --> 02:13:07.903]  If you are a fighter, if they are trying to silence you, you are here this weekend and he wants you to inspire one another and that's why- And that's why the audience should know.
[02:13:08.823 --> 02:13:16.406]  I know they're not doing it, but you can't go to sleep, and I know you're not meant to fight politics every year, every month, but this is the big global turning.
[02:13:16.406 --> 02:13:19.768]  Every bit of energy we put in now goes on for thousands of years.
[02:13:19.768 --> 02:13:21.268]  Yes, this is the fight.
[02:13:21.268 --> 02:13:22.169]  There's no other fight.
[02:13:22.169 --> 02:13:24.210]  This is the fight that everyone needs to be in.
[02:13:24.210 --> 02:13:29.072]  Do whatever you do, whatever your talent is, if it's videos, if it's talking, if it's blogging, if it's writing.
[02:13:29.072 --> 02:13:32.553]  Be a part of this, because we are making history right now, Alex.
[02:13:32.553 --> 02:13:34.794]  And I can't underestimate the power of prayer as well.
[02:13:35.712 --> 02:13:36.252]  Right.
[02:13:36.252 --> 02:13:37.833]  It's just, we need everything.
[02:13:37.833 --> 02:13:39.354]  And I say that all the time.
[02:13:39.354 --> 02:13:42.395]  It's not just me making videos, people that support me.
[02:13:42.395 --> 02:13:43.516]  You know, I couldn't do without them.
[02:13:43.516 --> 02:13:48.118]  I couldn't do without them writing to me and saying, we don't believe this, keep going, keep going.
[02:13:48.118 --> 02:13:50.459]  So it's... Well, absolutely.
[02:13:50.459 --> 02:13:52.020]  And the things they made up about you won't even...
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:53.241]  I mean, thank you so much.
[02:13:53.241 --> 02:13:54.262]  I thought you were all total bull.
[02:13:54.262 --> 02:13:55.263]  But again, exactly.
[02:13:55.263 --> 02:13:56.044]  Just say it's bull.
[02:13:56.044 --> 02:13:56.765]  Move on.
[02:13:56.765 --> 02:13:58.367]  Just keep getting the... And keep fighting.
[02:13:58.367 --> 02:13:59.769]  Punch back and keep going.
[02:13:59.769 --> 02:14:01.030]  That is what Ann Coulter said to me.
[02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:02.372]  That is what Katie Hopkins said to me.
[02:14:02.372 --> 02:14:06.156]  And I said, God bless these women because they've been doing it for years and years and years.
[02:14:06.156 --> 02:14:08.059]  And I looked at myself and I said, what's my excuse?
[02:14:08.519 --> 02:14:09.981]  What am I upset about, you know?
[02:14:09.981 --> 02:14:11.723]  This is one of many smears that are going to come.
[02:14:11.723 --> 02:14:12.784]  They're going to try to shut me up.
[02:14:12.784 --> 02:14:13.906]  And you know what my job is?
[02:14:13.906 --> 02:14:17.110]  To punch back and keep going and to wake up the black community.
[02:14:17.110 --> 02:14:19.553]  Because this is a war, okay?
[02:14:19.553 --> 02:14:21.255]  This is an information war.
[02:14:21.255 --> 02:14:25.700]  And what side of it you fall on is going to be how you represent yourself historically.
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:28.003]  Because we are making history right now.
[02:14:28.692 --> 02:14:35.377]  I was about to say, a lot of folks have come now and we're starting to have big victories, but this is the peak of the battle we're going into.
[02:14:35.377 --> 02:14:39.079]  So this is the hardest time, but also the best time to be getting involved.
[02:14:39.079 --> 02:14:48.406]  And every call to C-SPAN, everybody that wears a t-shirt in public, everybody that is loving to their children, everybody that prays to God, everybody that supports a broadcast like this or shares a link.
[02:14:49.226 --> 02:14:53.409]  All of it together is a giant mountain of energy every day.
[02:14:53.409 --> 02:14:54.990]  Many hands make light work, folks.
[02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:59.073]  So again, when I tell you thank you, InfoWars, the President's told me this.
[02:14:59.073 --> 02:15:00.094]  It's been said all over the news.
[02:15:00.094 --> 02:15:01.435]  They know it.
[02:15:01.435 --> 02:15:06.198]  Trump wouldn't be President if it wasn't for InfoWars, if it wasn't for you, the audience.
[02:15:06.198 --> 02:15:13.123]  We were the key heart cadre in support and in information warfare and in breaking stories.
[02:15:13.123 --> 02:15:16.545]  We're identified by Podesta, Hillary, everybody, as the stories that sunk them.
[02:15:18.837 --> 02:15:22.478]  Again, those stories that sunk them, they're coming after me for now.
[02:15:22.478 --> 02:15:23.998]  But that's how time-space works.
[02:15:23.998 --> 02:15:24.478]  It doesn't matter.
[02:15:24.478 --> 02:15:26.378]  I've already won that battle.
[02:15:26.378 --> 02:15:30.959]  The larger war is here, but I've now got to deal with missiles they fired back at the time that that happened.
[02:15:30.959 --> 02:15:34.780]  But we're here, it's all happening, and I want you to know, this is history.
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:38.260]  Candace Owens, Red Pill Black, I want to talk to you again whenever you want to come on.
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:41.801]  You're wonderful, you're amazing, and I'll say it, you've got a beautiful soul.
[02:15:41.801 --> 02:15:42.801]  We really appreciate it.
[02:15:42.801 --> 02:15:43.941]  That's why the enemy fears you.
[02:15:43.941 --> 02:15:47.002]  We'll talk to you soon, and please come on and give us a report about the rest of the event.
[02:15:47.968 --> 02:15:48.891]  Absolutely, I will.
[02:15:48.891 --> 02:15:49.894]  Thank you guys so much.
[02:15:49.894 --> 02:15:51.921]  I so appreciate you guys that watch InfoWars.
[02:15:51.921 --> 02:15:52.363]  You're amazing.
[02:15:52.363 --> 02:15:53.166]  We appreciate you!
[02:15:54.184 --> 02:15:56.084]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:15:56.084 --> 02:15:59.305]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:15:59.305 --> 02:16:00.906]  Savory and delicious.
[02:16:00.906 --> 02:16:03.746]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:16:03.746 --> 02:16:04.406]  Awesome!
[02:16:04.406 --> 02:16:07.487]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[02:16:07.487 --> 02:16:09.048]  NASA PAC Technology.
[02:16:09.048 --> 02:16:09.668]  Bacon.
[02:16:09.668 --> 02:16:13.829]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[02:16:13.829 --> 02:16:15.269]  Or warm and served.
[02:16:15.269 --> 02:16:17.309]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:16:17.309 --> 02:16:19.250]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:22.031]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.

[02:16:24.508 --> 02:16:25.288]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:16:25.288 --> 02:16:27.109]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:28.750]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:31.592]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:16:31.592 --> 02:16:33.873]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:16:33.873 --> 02:16:38.375]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:17:22.478 --> 02:17:26.562]  It's like having an electric power plant running secretly in your own home.

[02:18:55.052 --> 02:19:05.018]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of a giant time bomb.
[02:19:05.018 --> 02:19:13.562]  With populations and globalism and the New World Order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy.
[02:19:13.562 --> 02:19:15.503]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[02:19:16.058 --> 02:19:18.881]  We've also got to have rear-guard actions to be prepared.
[02:19:18.881 --> 02:19:23.405]  The number one thing, after getting right with God, is to have high-quality, storable food.
[02:19:23.405 --> 02:19:29.491]  Well, the entire line of My Patriot Supply Foods, private-labeled as InfoWars Select, is now 50% off.
[02:19:29.491 --> 02:19:33.595]  We've only done that one time before previously.
[02:19:33.595 --> 02:19:34.435]  50% off.
[02:19:34.435 --> 02:19:35.797]  You cannot beat that.
[02:19:35.797 --> 02:19:38.459]  And we're only doing that through Cyber Monday.
[02:19:38.459 --> 02:19:41.442]  So it starts today on Thanksgiving and runs through next Monday.
[02:19:41.442 --> 02:19:43.003]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:10.209 --> 02:20:18.475]  All right, Millie Weaver just got back from the Clinton event, Hillary Clinton event, and she said she's getting stalked, getting followed, and they broke into her phone.
[02:20:18.475 --> 02:20:22.158]  So I'm gonna have to find out more from her during the next break.
[02:20:22.158 --> 02:20:29.824]  That's going on right before I got on air 30 seconds ago, 45 seconds ago, so all hell's breaking loose, basically, here in the War Room.
[02:20:29.824 --> 02:20:33.967]  That's why I call the Ellen Schreyer Show the War Room.
[02:20:33.967 --> 02:20:36.789]  I mean, that's what this is.
[02:20:36.789 --> 02:20:38.250]  It's like we had the Al Franken news.
[02:20:39.102 --> 02:20:42.924]  Day and a half before, but... I wasn't afraid to put it out.
[02:20:42.924 --> 02:20:50.187]  I was just like... Okay, but I gotta wait and I can't say who the woman is.
[02:20:50.187 --> 02:20:53.728]  I'm not gonna cover it.
[02:20:53.728 --> 02:20:56.569]  See, most people would want that big breaking story.
[02:20:56.569 --> 02:21:00.951]  I just want to be credible and actually help things and make things better.
[02:21:00.951 --> 02:21:04.933]  But you can see how we tweeted out just to have it on record before it came out that we had the news.
[02:21:06.215 --> 02:21:15.118]  That's why they constantly, you know, say, oh, we're fake news because they know, folks, we make mistakes, but we're not trying to make mistakes.
[02:21:15.118 --> 02:21:18.479]  We are beating ourselves up to tell the truth.
[02:21:18.479 --> 02:21:21.480]  And not because we're Mr. Goody Tissues, man.
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.760]  We want to have integrity.
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:27.861]  My ancestors had integrity.
[02:21:27.861 --> 02:21:28.962]  I remember being a teenager.
[02:21:28.962 --> 02:21:31.142]  You're kind of naturally nasty when you're a teenager.
[02:21:31.142 --> 02:21:32.763]  I'm thinking, my dad,
[02:21:33.581 --> 02:21:43.064]  And his dad and my mother's dad and my mother's brother were just Mr. America, goody two shoes, and it wasn't an act.
[02:21:43.064 --> 02:21:43.684]  It wasn't.
[02:21:43.684 --> 02:21:48.125]  It was like they were enslaved to being good men.
[02:21:48.125 --> 02:21:50.246]  I'm not as good as they are.
[02:21:50.246 --> 02:21:51.306]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:21:51.306 --> 02:21:52.047]  I have a dark side.
[02:21:52.047 --> 02:21:57.208]  I don't let it run me, but I can see into the enemy more because I see how they see us.
[02:21:57.208 --> 02:21:58.829]  So that's how God works.
[02:21:58.829 --> 02:22:01.710]  I'm more twisted.
[02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:02.250]  And so I
[02:22:04.062 --> 02:22:20.026]  I understand what the enemy's up to, but back when I was darker, I was never given over to evil, but when I was darker, I thought they were weak, because they were good men.
[02:22:20.026 --> 02:22:24.167]  People that are into evil, they think they're so strong because they're not good people.
[02:22:24.167 --> 02:22:29.528]  They think they're strong because they only care about themselves, and sometimes they're weak.
[02:22:29.528 --> 02:22:32.029]  They're weak.
[02:22:32.029 --> 02:22:33.469]  You see, the fact that I have a weak side,
[02:22:34.989 --> 02:22:38.130]  I can understand these people.
[02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:40.811]  And my good side's big.
[02:22:40.811 --> 02:22:46.474]  That's the difference, though.
[02:22:46.474 --> 02:22:48.014]  I've got all these Hillary clips I want to play.
[02:22:48.014 --> 02:22:50.515]  They'll get to their latest secret meeting.
[02:22:50.515 --> 02:22:51.616]  This is very, very important.
[02:22:51.616 --> 02:22:53.576]  You know, I've got so many of these.
[02:22:53.576 --> 02:22:55.857]  Let's just go ahead and start with the first one.
[02:22:55.857 --> 02:22:57.158]  And it's self-explanatory.
[02:22:58.539 --> 02:23:20.278]  Corporate media is now behaving like questioning the Clintons is some war crime, and that Trump wants a dictatorship, even though the Clintons tried to get dictatorships, Obama tried to put it in, that they're the ones that want to censor the press, they're the ones that want to open our borders up and sign us over to the TPP and dictatorial systems, and then now they're setting it up where Trump's the bad guy,
[02:23:21.286 --> 02:23:25.608]  And anybody that criticizes the Clintons wants a dictatorship.
[02:23:25.608 --> 02:23:27.629]  Oh, because what, you're still in the government?
[02:23:27.629 --> 02:23:29.050]  So we want you out of government?
[02:23:29.050 --> 02:23:30.010]  That's a dictatorship?
[02:23:30.010 --> 02:23:32.051]  Because that's how they see it.
[02:23:32.051 --> 02:23:36.133]  It's their camp, still in power, and they're holding back the great Trump evil.
[02:23:36.133 --> 02:23:36.513]  Here it is.
[02:23:36.513 --> 02:23:43.977]  This appears to be the politicization of the Justice Department and our justice system.
[02:23:45.593 --> 02:23:54.678]  This Uranium One story has been debunked countless times by members of the press, by independent experts.
[02:23:54.678 --> 02:23:56.539]  It is nothing but a false charge.
[02:24:00.197 --> 02:24:01.177]  Look at this reporter.
[02:24:01.177 --> 02:24:04.918]  He looks just like the BuzzFeed reporters, like a woman that cut their hair short.
[02:24:04.918 --> 02:24:13.400]  And I'm not being mean, but they're all like little skinny zombies you've never heard of, because that's who slime bags like Hillary want to be around.
[02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:14.780]  They don't want to have real men around them.
[02:24:14.780 --> 02:24:23.222]  In fact, they've had mainstream news articles saying, and psychiatrists have pointed out, that Hillary always wants really ugly people around her, because she's ugly too.
[02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:26.531]  See, that's why misery loves company.
[02:24:26.531 --> 02:24:29.293]  But, oh, Uranium One, it's been debunked.
[02:24:29.293 --> 02:24:31.594]  Even the New York Times admits it's smoking gun.
[02:24:31.594 --> 02:24:35.336]  You guys have been caught red-handed, but you say it's been debunked.
[02:24:35.336 --> 02:24:37.238]  Oh, and you never had a secret server either.
[02:24:37.238 --> 02:24:38.638]  You told our reporters that.
[02:24:38.638 --> 02:24:39.899]  Oh, I never had a server.
[02:24:39.899 --> 02:24:43.281]  None of it was hacked.
[02:24:43.281 --> 02:24:45.483]  If you like your doctor, you can keep it.
[02:24:45.483 --> 02:24:47.324]  Here, let's continue.
[02:24:47.324 --> 02:24:49.285]  Members of the press, by independent experts,
[02:24:50.686 --> 02:25:02.555]  It is nothing but a false charge that the Trump administration is trying to drum up in order to avoid attention being directed at them.
[02:25:02.555 --> 02:25:11.441]  Even Trey Gowdy, somebody who's hardly a fan of mine, said that there doesn't seem to be the basis for a special counsel.
[02:25:11.441 --> 02:25:12.382]  Of course, there isn't.
[02:25:13.314 --> 02:25:25.772]  But if I try to take myself out of it, which you know is kind of hard because it's personally offensive that they would do this, but taking myself out of it, this is such an abuse of power and it
[02:25:26.323 --> 02:25:26.543]  What?
[02:25:26.543 --> 02:25:27.224]  Okay, what has Trump done?
[02:25:27.224 --> 02:25:27.805]  I cut her off.
[02:25:27.805 --> 02:25:29.086]  She doesn't say anything.
[02:25:29.086 --> 02:25:29.927]  I can't listen to it.
[02:25:29.927 --> 02:25:30.908]  Here's what Trey Gowdy really said.
[02:25:30.908 --> 02:25:32.410]  Here's the clip she's talking about.
[02:25:46.349 --> 02:25:49.631]  On the issue of special counsel, I did not sign.
[02:25:49.631 --> 02:25:50.772]  Jim Jordan's a great friend.
[02:25:50.772 --> 02:25:52.373]  I have tremendous respect for him.
[02:25:52.373 --> 02:25:57.797]  I did not sign the letter because I don't think the threshold has been met for the appointment of special counsel.
[02:25:57.797 --> 02:26:00.038]  And I think this is a really important point.
[02:26:00.038 --> 02:26:02.580]  You can investigate something without special counsel.
[02:26:02.580 --> 02:26:09.925]  In fact, 99.9% of all investigations in this country are done by the women and men at the Department of Justice and the U.S.
[02:26:09.925 --> 02:26:13.527]  Attorney's offices, and none of them is called special counsel.
[02:26:13.527 --> 02:26:15.929]  So there's a threshold that has to be met.
[02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:18.995]  And I don't think it has been met.
[02:26:18.995 --> 02:26:24.666]  So, to say we're not going to appoint special counsel is not to say we're not going to look into something.
[02:26:24.666 --> 02:26:26.610]  You're saying the threshold has not been met?
[02:26:27.395 --> 02:26:28.115]  Yeah.
[02:26:28.115 --> 02:26:29.696]  At what point is it, Matt?
[02:26:29.696 --> 02:26:32.076]  What do you need to get there?
[02:26:32.076 --> 02:26:32.816]  A conflict of interest.
[02:26:32.816 --> 02:26:33.977]  If you do get there.
[02:26:33.977 --> 02:26:38.218]  A conflict of interest where the Department of Justice and all 94 U.S.
[02:26:38.218 --> 02:26:45.519]  Attorney's Offices are ill-suited and the public would not have confidence in an investigation that they ran.
[02:26:45.519 --> 02:26:48.540]  I mean, look, Bob Mueller was appointed special counsel.
[02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:50.861]  Some of your viewers don't have confidence in him.
[02:26:50.861 --> 02:26:56.842]  So the appointment of special counsel does not talismanically make people all of a sudden have confidence in something.
[02:26:57.699 --> 02:26:59.562]  It was done because people didn't have confidence.
[02:26:59.562 --> 02:27:01.025]  It was done politically.
[02:27:01.025 --> 02:27:03.429]  So why do we create another political thing?
[02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:05.473]  That's what's really being said here.
[02:27:05.473 --> 02:27:07.937]  But we're getting lost here in the weeds, folks.
[02:27:07.937 --> 02:27:09.220]  They're all super guilty.
[02:27:10.106 --> 02:27:14.348]  The fact that he's saying it doesn't reach the level of special counsel, that means there's not public confidence.
[02:27:14.348 --> 02:27:17.129]  Well, I think there is a public confidence in the Justice Department right now.
[02:27:17.129 --> 02:27:19.150]  Actually, Gowdy, I disagree with Gowdy on that.
[02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:23.611]  But here's Morning Joe saying Uranium One is dumb conspiracy theory.
[02:27:23.611 --> 02:27:25.052]  Oh, you didn't give the uranium?
[02:27:25.052 --> 02:27:26.673]  There wasn't a criminal investigation?
[02:27:26.673 --> 02:27:28.013]  Mueller didn't order its end?
[02:27:28.013 --> 02:27:28.914]  You're full of baloney.
[02:27:28.914 --> 02:27:29.974]  Here it is.
[02:27:29.974 --> 02:27:32.215]  We had an attorney general that stepped up
[02:27:33.004 --> 02:27:49.856]  And did not look like he was not going to allow, look like, he was not going to allow our President, our Republicans in Congress, turn this Justice Department into some device for a tyrannical autocrat in the making.
[02:27:49.856 --> 02:27:52.658]  If he listened to Donald Trump,
[02:27:53.238 --> 02:27:58.059]  This would shatter constitutional norms and would be chilling.
[02:27:58.059 --> 02:28:07.361]  President Trump and his allies have been hammering the Clinton State Department for months, calling the Uranium One deal, quote, Watergate modern age.
[02:28:07.361 --> 02:28:10.142]  It's also been covered virtually wall-to-wall on Fox News.
[02:28:10.142 --> 02:28:13.243]  Sam Sine Shep actually just... It's incredible.
[02:28:13.243 --> 02:28:17.404]  Shep undercut this entire conspiracy theory and it is, you
[02:28:18.424 --> 02:28:19.164]  Yeah.
[02:28:19.164 --> 02:28:21.726]  And like the clown show.
[02:28:21.726 --> 02:28:25.767]  Because, again, you had all these agencies that had to sign off on it.
[02:28:25.767 --> 02:28:29.449]  This wasn't Hillary Clinton saying, give me money and I'm going to take care of this.
[02:28:29.449 --> 02:28:31.690]  Agency C-Control!
[02:28:31.690 --> 02:28:34.552]  Criminal investigations, they ordered killed!
[02:28:34.552 --> 02:28:35.492]  Gosh almighty!
[02:28:35.492 --> 02:28:39.374]  I mean, uranium deals, secret deals, transfer deals, and then you're talking about
[02:28:40.038 --> 02:28:40.959]  Donald Trump Jr.
[02:28:40.959 --> 02:28:42.640]  trying to meet to find corruption on Hillary.
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:43.741]  That's Russian collusion.
[02:28:43.741 --> 02:28:45.202]  But uranium transfers aren't.
[02:28:45.202 --> 02:28:47.323]  And them buying off politicians.
[02:28:47.323 --> 02:28:47.884]  We'll be back.
[02:28:47.884 --> 02:28:48.304]  Stay with us.

[02:29:55.214 --> 02:30:15.184]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:30:15.184 --> 02:30:17.305]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:30:17.305 --> 02:30:21.307]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:21.307 --> 02:30:22.508]  I want to thank everybody that has, but

[02:30:36.377 --> 02:30:40.780]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:30:55.170 --> 02:31:04.658]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar, a 360 win.
[02:31:04.658 --> 02:31:11.224]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:31:11.224 --> 02:31:18.751]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:31:19.151 --> 02:31:23.813]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:31:23.813 --> 02:31:30.336]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:31:30.336 --> 02:31:38.120]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:45.323]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature in InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:31:45.323 --> 02:31:46.124]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:31:46.544 --> 02:31:47.565]  We're good to go.
[02:32:02.756 --> 02:32:04.037]  Powerful and affordable.
[02:32:04.037 --> 02:32:06.619]  Great tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:32:06.619 --> 02:32:17.268]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:32:17.268 --> 02:32:24.775]  In the history of Infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[02:32:25.075 --> 02:32:35.299]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:32:35.299 --> 02:32:37.360]  And this part is most important.

[02:32:44.183 --> 02:32:45.603]  That means it's clean.
[02:32:45.603 --> 02:32:46.724]  That means it's pure.
[02:32:46.724 --> 02:32:49.625]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:32:49.625 --> 02:32:52.426]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:32:52.426 --> 02:32:54.047]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:32:57.174 --> 02:33:16.691]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.691 --> 02:33:24.598]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.373 --> 02:33:29.594]  All right, Millie Weaver just came in here.
[02:33:29.594 --> 02:33:33.497]  They just got back from Hillary Clinton's visit to Austin, Texas.
[02:33:33.497 --> 02:33:35.938]  We got other reporters going to her Dallas event.
[02:33:35.938 --> 02:33:37.839]  Sure they know that.
[02:33:37.839 --> 02:33:41.581]  Her stupid book tour of her failure of a book.
[02:33:41.581 --> 02:33:42.322]  What happened?
[02:33:42.322 --> 02:33:43.702]  You happened, lady.
[02:33:43.702 --> 02:33:45.644]  People woke up to you.
[02:33:45.644 --> 02:33:48.685]  Millie just came in and told me the footage they got.
[02:33:48.685 --> 02:33:49.846]  Now, it was Millie
[02:33:51.091 --> 02:33:59.556]  One week before, in Cleveland, Ohio, one week before September 11th, when Hillary fell down like one of the towers and fell on her face.
[02:33:59.556 --> 02:34:04.058]  The media tried to cover it up, but we had the footage.
[02:34:04.058 --> 02:34:11.743]  They would just show her stumble and say that was it, not the rest of her falling over and being thrown on the side of the black ambulance like a side of beef, as the Secret Service said.
[02:34:11.743 --> 02:34:18.907]  Millie and Gavin were following her around and they got her in the emergency tent for an hour and the emergency stretchers
[02:34:20.214 --> 02:34:22.856]  We have those articles.
[02:34:22.856 --> 02:34:26.839]  In fact, here's some of the footage of Hillary falling down.
[02:34:26.839 --> 02:34:34.205]  They were at the event and they got Hillary having to be lifted out of the ambulance again.
[02:34:34.205 --> 02:34:40.389]  They had to pull her up and had to physically set her up and pull her out.
[02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:43.351]  And you see them holding on to her and helping her upstairs, all that other footage.
[02:34:43.351 --> 02:34:49.476]  It's like the weekend with Bernie's when she has these seizures from the brain tumor.
[02:34:51.346 --> 02:34:52.967]  You know, we're not supposed to know that information.
[02:34:52.967 --> 02:34:55.409]  You know, there's federal laws on medical records.
[02:34:55.409 --> 02:35:00.653]  So, I just had a CIA source say that that should be looked into.
[02:35:00.653 --> 02:35:17.487]  The point is, is that they have footage of her having to be pulled out of the vehicle, not being able to get up, and they have them calling the Dallas police, or Austin police, Dallas is next, on
[02:35:19.884 --> 02:35:22.905]  Millie, and then the Dallas Police tell their goons, leave her alone.
[02:35:22.905 --> 02:35:24.725]  She's allowed to be out here on the sidewalk.
[02:35:24.725 --> 02:35:25.826]  So good for the Austin cops.
[02:35:25.826 --> 02:35:30.927]  I don't know if the Dallas cops would be so good if she's about to be there next.
[02:35:30.927 --> 02:35:35.868]  So this is just incredible.
[02:35:35.868 --> 02:35:48.812]  Now I want to go ahead and go to this next clip, but she's going to be coming on either next segment or fourth hour with myself and Mike Cernovich, but we're going to have Millie Weaver, our intrepid reporter, her and Gavin just when it comes to devastating victories every time they go out.
[02:35:48.812 --> 02:35:49.012]  I mean,
[02:35:51.878 --> 02:35:54.459]  They've got powerful gods.
[02:35:54.459 --> 02:35:56.100]  And I don't mean that in a paganistic way.
[02:35:56.100 --> 02:36:01.502]  That's a quote from the show Rome on HBO, which is actually a real quote from Julius Caesar.
[02:36:01.502 --> 02:36:04.263]  He talked about people that kept having good success, good luck.
[02:36:04.263 --> 02:36:07.304]  They'd say, these men have powerful gods.
[02:36:07.304 --> 02:36:11.906]  And you know, the fact that good luck, God's on their side, the force is with them.
[02:36:11.906 --> 02:36:18.068]  They just, every time they go out, it's just fantastical what they get.
[02:36:18.068 --> 02:36:20.289]  So very, very awesome to have
[02:36:21.235 --> 02:36:21.655]  We're good to go.
[02:36:49.498 --> 02:36:52.120]  Listen, we don't know what's wrong with her.
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:55.123]  You're the one who has guests on about her brain tumor.
[02:36:55.123 --> 02:36:58.305]  All we know is she's having convulsions every 45 minutes or so.
[02:36:58.305 --> 02:36:59.526]  She's got a black ambulance.
[02:36:59.526 --> 02:37:01.708]  It's got lift gates on it on the back and the front.
[02:37:01.708 --> 02:37:03.630]  They've got clinic things set up.
[02:37:03.630 --> 02:37:06.572]  She's having these convulsions all the time.
[02:37:06.572 --> 02:37:08.434]  And that's all we're going to tell you.
[02:37:08.434 --> 02:37:12.457]  So just tell everybody, follow her around, you'll get it.
[02:37:12.457 --> 02:37:15.680]  Well, we got her in the emergency tent the week before in Cleveland.
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:18.222]  This Dutch video guy, he was a fan.
[02:37:19.921 --> 02:37:21.442]  He just got back there and caught it.
[02:37:21.442 --> 02:37:22.882]  So the Secret Service was right.
[02:37:22.882 --> 02:37:24.723]  We were proven right again from our sources.
[02:37:24.723 --> 02:37:27.363]  It happened.
[02:37:27.363 --> 02:37:41.208]  Just like we told you the reported main shooter in the Vegas thing, Paddock, had gone to the Middle East with his girlfriend and had a visitor and was there days earlier and had Islamic paraphernalia and antifa.
[02:37:41.208 --> 02:37:44.069]  That all came out later, except for the antifa part.
[02:37:45.970 --> 02:37:50.732]  Because, I mean, we got that directly from, and people say, well, wait, I thought the FBI's corrupt.
[02:37:50.732 --> 02:37:55.333]  But then you're saying the hostage rescue team, they're not all corrupt.
[02:37:55.333 --> 02:37:57.534]  A fish rots from the head.
[02:37:57.534 --> 02:38:02.576]  Crap rolls downhill.
[02:38:02.576 --> 02:38:06.077]  I mean, you're in there and you see all this Islamic stuff and you know where Paddock's been.
[02:38:06.077 --> 02:38:09.678]  You've got his M.O.
[02:38:09.678 --> 02:38:11.879]  You want to tell people you don't see gun owners being blamed?
[02:38:13.948 --> 02:38:20.493]  Because the guys that actually do the shooting in the FBI, they're former military or current military or patriots.
[02:38:20.493 --> 02:38:24.415]  They don't like the politicos always getting away with murder.
[02:38:24.415 --> 02:38:25.716]  I haven't even hit on the news.
[02:38:25.716 --> 02:38:30.239]  I mean, it's usually such big topics that I literally sit here with like 200 articles probably.
[02:38:30.239 --> 02:38:33.642]  I bet if I count all these articles up, I bet there's 200.
[02:38:33.642 --> 02:38:35.203]  Conservatively.
[02:38:35.203 --> 02:38:36.223]  I mean, just the stacks like 15.
[02:38:36.223 --> 02:38:36.423]  So 15, 15, 45,
[02:38:43.085 --> 02:38:43.225]  65, 70.
[02:38:43.225 --> 02:38:44.786]  Oh yeah, it's well over.
[02:38:44.786 --> 02:38:45.806]  It's maybe 120.
[02:38:45.806 --> 02:38:47.667]  A little bit light today.
[02:38:47.667 --> 02:38:48.467]  Sometimes they have 200, 300.
[02:38:48.467 --> 02:38:49.147]  I don't know.
[02:38:49.147 --> 02:38:49.947]  This is a big stack.
[02:38:49.947 --> 02:38:52.488]  That's like 30 articles.
[02:38:52.488 --> 02:38:58.010]  The point is, is that I don't have all the answers.
[02:38:58.010 --> 02:38:59.550]  We've got social engineers.
[02:38:59.550 --> 02:39:01.451]  They admit they're doing this to us.
[02:39:01.451 --> 02:39:02.891]  They only operate in the dark.
[02:39:02.891 --> 02:39:04.051]  They operate with our tax money.
[02:39:04.051 --> 02:39:07.412]  They operate with corporate jurisdiction offshore that are above the law.
[02:39:07.412 --> 02:39:09.893]  They got thousands of labs, human-animal chimeras.
[02:39:09.893 --> 02:39:10.934]  Hell, that's 35 years old!
[02:39:13.072 --> 02:39:19.375]  Who knows what they've got now?
[02:39:19.375 --> 02:39:27.618]  All I know is all they talk about in public reports is how they want to get rid of the majority of the public, how we're a bunch of weevils eating up their planet.
[02:39:27.618 --> 02:39:32.980]  And I'm like, listen, buddy.
[02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:36.041]  I'm going to tell people about this.
[02:39:36.041 --> 02:39:38.002]  And it's not because I'm some hero.
[02:39:38.002 --> 02:39:42.144]  They're trying to make me take vaccines and my kids, and I know they're jacking with them.
[02:39:43.524 --> 02:39:44.785]  It's called self-preservation.
[02:39:44.785 --> 02:39:52.908]  When I see somebody else in a car wreck get out with their face smashed, bleeding, I have empathy because I know what that feels like.
[02:39:52.908 --> 02:39:56.270]  I know it could be my kids in that wreck.
[02:39:56.270 --> 02:39:59.291]  The fact that I got nerve endings doesn't mean I'm a wimp.
[02:39:59.291 --> 02:40:00.111]  It's the opposite.
[02:40:00.111 --> 02:40:06.975]  I've got feelings because that's how you get through the world is having feelings.
[02:40:06.975 --> 02:40:07.835]  Being connected.
[02:40:08.703 --> 02:40:14.305]  The globalists work to not have feelings, and they become psychopaths, or sociopaths, and it's a joke!
[02:40:14.305 --> 02:40:15.626]  And I'm tired of these people!
[02:40:15.626 --> 02:40:17.367]  I don't like them!
[02:40:17.367 --> 02:40:23.810]  They don't produce wealth, they don't produce longevity, they don't produce anything but baloney, like North Korea.
[02:40:23.810 --> 02:40:27.051]  And you know what I'm gonna do?
[02:40:27.051 --> 02:40:35.775]  One way or another, if the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek, or the air doesn't lift the Admiral, I am going to shoot a special video about Trump's speech in South Korea.
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:55.947]  Because if I just air it, it's 30 minutes long, it's powerful, but if I show images and documents and clips, and make it like 45 minutes an hour long, where he builds up South Korea and shows how they're like one of the most successful countries in the world, per capita for the average person, the biggest middle class, I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:40:55.947 --> 02:41:00.789]  They have the highest rate of autism though, because they're very dutiful, they take all their vaccines, they do whatever America says!
[02:41:02.216 --> 02:41:04.057]  Well, that means the corrupt interests that are in America.
[02:41:04.057 --> 02:41:06.699]  That means America is perfect, or great, or the best, or the worst.
[02:41:06.699 --> 02:41:10.301]  We're amazing, but we're not one thing.
[02:41:10.301 --> 02:41:14.304]  We're amazingly good, we're amazingly bad.
[02:41:14.304 --> 02:41:19.307]  We're looking forward, we're looking backward, we're looking all around, but freedom comes with that.
[02:41:19.307 --> 02:41:21.669]  A lot of choices, a lot of good, a lot of bad, a lot of in-between.
[02:41:22.358 --> 02:41:42.446]  But he just lays out how they are, compared to the North, how it's two different universes completely, and how authoritarianism versus independence and the individual is two different universes, and how the secrets of the universe must be unlocked by the individual mind and the individual inventor, from the lowliest to the highest, and that's what's going to empower us into the future.
[02:41:42.446 --> 02:41:47.928]  It is an incredible speech.
[02:41:47.928 --> 02:41:51.010]  And it documents the difference between free market and communism.
[02:41:51.010 --> 02:41:51.970]  Authoritarianism
[02:41:53.771 --> 02:41:55.792]  And libertarianism.
[02:41:55.792 --> 02:42:09.594]  Just briefly, if you don't buy the products we've got at InfoWars store, the probiotics, the digestive enzymes, Carnivore, it's so amazing what it does for you, getting all the nutrients, breaking stuff down.
[02:42:09.594 --> 02:42:14.095]  You can take all the vitamins and minerals you want, so if you don't have the digestive enzymes, you don't actually get it out of there.
[02:42:14.095 --> 02:42:16.176]  Carnivore is a new product in InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:42:16.176 --> 02:42:21.577]  It goes along with our two new FloraLife daily dietary support, and we also have the advanced
[02:42:22.228 --> 02:42:24.089]  Digestive support.
[02:42:24.089 --> 02:42:24.890]  Got a bunch of great products.
[02:42:24.890 --> 02:42:26.971]  Digestive enzyme, Carnivore.
[02:42:26.971 --> 02:42:29.032]  The $15 billion everyday maintenance.
[02:42:29.032 --> 02:42:31.393]  $15 billion live probiotic from Floralife.
[02:42:31.393 --> 02:42:33.935]  And then Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[02:42:33.935 --> 02:42:35.495]  $50 billion live probiotics.
[02:42:35.495 --> 02:42:36.116]  It's all there.
[02:42:36.116 --> 02:42:37.557]  Free shipping goes to the weekend.
[02:42:37.557 --> 02:42:38.477]  Got a lot of new specials.
[02:42:38.477 --> 02:42:39.318]  The old specials had to end.
[02:42:39.318 --> 02:42:41.439]  We have new specials that are about to end.
[02:42:41.439 --> 02:42:42.919]  On Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:42:42.919 --> 02:42:44.200]  On Caveman and more.
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:46.001]  Now 50% off with free shipping.
[02:42:46.001 --> 02:42:48.583]  Some of those are a lost leader at that price.
[02:42:48.583 --> 02:42:49.823]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:42:49.823 --> 02:42:50.544]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:42:54.289 --> 02:43:04.459]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of a giant time bomb.
[02:43:04.459 --> 02:43:12.827]  With populations and globalism and the New World Order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy.
[02:43:12.827 --> 02:43:14.769]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[02:43:15.442 --> 02:43:18.145]  We've also got to have rear-guard actions to be prepared.
[02:43:18.145 --> 02:43:22.689]  The number one thing, after getting right with God, is to have high-quality, storable food.
[02:43:22.689 --> 02:43:28.754]  Well, the entire line of MyPatriot Supply Foods, private-labeled as InfoWars Select, is now 50% off.
[02:43:28.754 --> 02:43:32.117]  We've only done that one time before previously.
[02:43:32.117 --> 02:43:32.438]  50% off.
[02:43:33.899 --> 02:43:35.180]  We're good to go.
[02:43:53.718 --> 02:44:05.182]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[02:44:05.182 --> 02:44:12.664]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[02:44:12.664 --> 02:44:22.587]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[02:44:23.047 --> 02:44:28.072]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife everyday maintenance.
[02:44:28.072 --> 02:44:38.362]  But all of these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[02:44:38.362 --> 02:44:44.228]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[02:44:44.228 --> 02:44:46.630]  When you purchase it at Infolwerestore.com, you
[02:44:47.534 --> 02:44:53.242]  We're also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:44:54.637 --> 02:44:55.137]  Not a group.
[02:44:55.137 --> 02:44:56.598]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:44:56.598 --> 02:44:57.918]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:44:57.918 --> 02:44:59.118]  Why is this so good?
[02:44:59.118 --> 02:45:04.400]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:17.944]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:45:17.944 --> 02:45:19.305]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:45:20.225 --> 02:45:21.727]  Spreading disease around.
[02:45:21.727 --> 02:45:24.308]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:45:24.308 --> 02:45:25.609]  These are all parasites.
[02:45:25.609 --> 02:45:26.710]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:28.071]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:45:28.071 --> 02:45:32.554]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[02:45:32.554 --> 02:45:35.737]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:45:35.737 --> 02:45:38.899]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:45:38.899 --> 02:45:39.960]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:40.780]  Living Defense.
[02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:41.881]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:41.881 --> 02:45:42.902]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:45:42.902 --> 02:45:45.604]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:45:45.604 --> 02:45:45.784]  And I
[02:45:46.324 --> 02:45:47.525]  Can you support the broadcast?
[02:45:47.525 --> 02:45:48.865]  Infowarslive.com.
[02:45:48.865 --> 02:45:51.106]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:45:51.106 --> 02:45:55.028]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:45:55.028 --> 02:45:58.150]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:45:58.150 --> 02:46:05.593]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:46:05.593 --> 02:46:11.196]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:46:11.956 --> 02:46:19.618]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:46:19.618 --> 02:46:28.221]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:46:28.221 --> 02:46:33.282]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:46:33.282 --> 02:46:34.783]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:46:35.422 --> 02:46:48.806]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:48.806 --> 02:46:55.968]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:55.968 --> 02:46:58.629]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:07.782 --> 02:47:15.463]  So, CNN goes on to say, investigating
[02:47:37.856 --> 02:47:43.379]  The Clintons is what happens in an authoritarian country.
[02:47:43.379 --> 02:47:47.041]  In the morning, Joe goes on to say what Joseph Stalin would do.
[02:47:47.041 --> 02:47:55.426]  Actually, what you're doing, trying to attack free press, trying to raise taxes on poor people, all the rest of it, that's what Joe Stalin would actually do.
[02:47:55.426 --> 02:47:59.769]  So let's go ahead and play a few more of these clips ahead of Millie Weaver.
[02:47:59.769 --> 02:48:05.232]  We're going to go into the fourth hour with Mike Cernovich, who's doing a great job co-hosting that with us.
[02:48:06.815 --> 02:48:12.216]  With Hillary here in Austin and where she was and what happened to her, having to be picked up and propped up and brought in.
[02:48:12.216 --> 02:48:15.537]  New footage of this, them trying to have the cops come after our reporters.
[02:48:15.537 --> 02:48:18.018]  The cops said, no, you leave them alone.
[02:48:18.018 --> 02:48:20.258]  So, a lot of good things happening there.
[02:48:20.258 --> 02:48:22.359]  People know who the enemy is, don't worry.
[02:48:22.359 --> 02:48:25.319]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:48:25.319 --> 02:48:28.640]  CNN investigating Clinton is what happens in an authoritarian country.
[02:48:36.070 --> 02:48:38.151]  Now we've got some technical problems here.
[02:48:38.151 --> 02:48:38.871]  Let's stop it.
[02:48:38.871 --> 02:48:41.512]  No big deal to have that occasionally happen.
[02:48:41.512 --> 02:48:44.353]  You guys want to try to reload it or just say it's not there?
[02:48:44.353 --> 02:48:45.953]  I'm cool either way.
[02:48:45.953 --> 02:48:49.134]  This happens on live TV.
[02:48:49.134 --> 02:48:50.154]  So that clip's not working.
[02:48:50.154 --> 02:48:51.155]  I've been wanting to play that one.
[02:48:51.155 --> 02:48:52.235]  That's a really good one.
[02:48:52.235 --> 02:48:53.255]  Let's redownload that one.
[02:48:53.255 --> 02:48:57.096]  Let's go ahead and go to the next one dealing with the Joe Stalin stuff.
[02:48:57.096 --> 02:48:58.677]  So here's that clip.
[02:48:58.677 --> 02:49:04.719]  First of all, we're going to get how horrific this is, what a horrific precedent this would set.
[02:49:06.571 --> 02:49:09.773]  Donald Trump goes after his political opponent.
[02:49:09.773 --> 02:49:15.457]  This way uses the Justice Department, pressures the Justice Department, pressures the Attorney General to do this.
[02:49:15.457 --> 02:49:16.398]  This is what happens.
[02:49:16.398 --> 02:49:19.059]  This is what Joseph Stalin would do.
[02:49:19.059 --> 02:49:27.585]  This is what tyrants have done for years, is sick their people on political opponents.
[02:49:27.585 --> 02:49:36.131]  But just the underlying charge, the claim here that somehow the Clintons benefited from this deal going through.
[02:49:37.071 --> 02:49:45.195]  It's an absence of malice moment where, you know, Paul Newman leans back in his chair and says, prove it.
[02:49:45.195 --> 02:49:48.356]  They're not going to prove anything here.
[02:49:48.356 --> 02:49:50.157]  There's no smoking gun here.
[02:49:50.157 --> 02:49:57.220]  There's no nothing here that's going to prove that the Clintons somehow got money.
[02:49:57.220 --> 02:50:00.121]  I mean, it might look bad.
[02:50:01.073 --> 02:50:01.754]  This is so pathetic!
[02:50:16.311 --> 02:50:20.035]  You saw that with Jeff Sessions, accusing himself because it was the right thing to do.
[02:50:20.035 --> 02:50:28.042]  You saw that with Rod Rosenstein, accusing himself and appointing Bob Mueller because that was the right thing to do.
[02:50:28.042 --> 02:50:37.832]  And in doing that, regardless of everything else these guys have done or will do, those were shining moments where they put the country and the Constitution first.
[02:50:39.325 --> 02:50:44.728]  What about that dead intern in your office?
[02:50:44.728 --> 02:50:51.452]  Oh, which you're always trying to destroy?
[02:50:51.452 --> 02:50:53.493]  By the way, look at Joe Scarborough.
[02:50:53.493 --> 02:50:56.835]  You know, I don't believe he's really an alien from Mars, but in Mars Attack, the girl has the B.I.
[02:50:56.835 --> 02:50:58.997]  haircut because she's really an alien.
[02:50:58.997 --> 02:51:01.358]  I mean, is he really an alien, Gray?
[02:51:01.358 --> 02:51:03.039]  Let's put him back on screen.
[02:51:03.039 --> 02:51:03.959]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:51:03.959 --> 02:51:06.361]  He's going to say, Jones believes Scarborough is an alien.
[02:51:06.361 --> 02:51:08.122]  Just, what a bozo the clown.
[02:51:09.813 --> 02:51:22.322]  And then you've got Mika Brzezinski and her war criminal father, you know, sitting there, and it's like, it may look bad they got money from the Russians and gave them all the uranium, but they got the government to say it was legal under Obama, so it's okay!
[02:51:22.322 --> 02:51:27.025]  And then they have the FBI kill an investigation.
[02:51:27.025 --> 02:51:29.067]  He just sits up there bumbling.
[02:51:29.067 --> 02:51:34.751]  This is what you get when a dead intern's found in your place, and then forever after,
[02:51:36.078 --> 02:51:37.878]  You're just this creature.
[02:51:37.878 --> 02:51:39.539]  Look how pathetic they all look.
[02:51:39.539 --> 02:51:44.160]  I mean, almost no one even watches these shows.
[02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:46.841]  And now he's going with this David Brock look.
[02:51:46.841 --> 02:51:50.122]  Where he has this big bozo hair.
[02:51:50.122 --> 02:51:51.082]  I am from Mars.
[02:51:51.082 --> 02:51:52.882]  I am here, planet is ours.
[02:51:52.882 --> 02:51:54.883]  And we're just supposed to bow down to this guy.
[02:51:54.883 --> 02:51:56.943]  I'm so sick of him.
[02:51:56.943 --> 02:51:58.124]  Pathetic.
[02:51:58.124 --> 02:52:01.644]  Oh, look at this little sniblet of news.
[02:52:01.644 --> 02:52:03.605]  Pelosi Soros headline.
[02:52:05.305 --> 02:52:09.489]  Anti-Trump Dark Money Conference.
[02:52:09.489 --> 02:52:11.110]  That's up on newswars.com.
[02:52:11.110 --> 02:52:16.734]  The Democracy Alliance, you know, they're not funding the Arab Spring or overthrowing the Iranian government trying to cause a race war.
[02:52:16.734 --> 02:52:29.405]  A dark money organization of prominent far-left donors that have all pledged to funnel money to approve left-wing groups to resist President Trump, close quote, traveled to California's La Cosa Resort
[02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:37.581]  Wednesday to attend their three-day fall summit with Pelosi, Soros, each set to give speeches.
[02:52:37.581 --> 02:52:39.102]  That's the Newsworth headline on it.
[02:52:39.102 --> 02:52:42.722]  But notice, seven of the ten richest members of Congress are Democrats.
[02:52:42.722 --> 02:52:44.143]  Yeah, I've seen the statistics.
[02:52:44.143 --> 02:52:48.544]  The Democrats have five times the wealth of the Republicans in Congress.
[02:52:48.544 --> 02:52:59.886]  Just like all the top globalists, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Ted Turner, just all of them are Democrats.
[02:53:01.445 --> 02:53:02.326]  Because they're globalists.
[02:53:02.326 --> 02:53:11.871]  They want to wreck everything, take over, flood us with cheap labor, tax-exempt, but they want to raise taxes all day so there's more middle-class money because they get bailouts and stuff.
[02:53:11.871 --> 02:53:21.297]  Warren Buffett, biggest recipient of the 2008 bailout, $487 billion that his company and he got.
[02:53:21.297 --> 02:53:26.841]  He got something like 50, I'll put the McClatchy headline, it'll say on the sub-yield.
[02:53:26.841 --> 02:53:30.383]  He got 50-plus billion himself in one day.
[02:53:32.882 --> 02:53:34.283]  I'd buy that for a dollar.
[02:53:34.283 --> 02:53:35.964]  Boy, I'm glad he's a liberal.
[02:53:35.964 --> 02:53:48.213]  Hey, I get all your tax money and fund third-world slave factories, but as long as I say I'm liberal, look, he always poses because he owns Dairy Queen with an ice cream cone.
[02:53:48.213 --> 02:53:50.795]  So, there you go.
[02:53:50.795 --> 02:53:56.379]  You tell the average leftist, you know the really rich people are for globalism and are leftists because they don't want you to have any money or any future.
[02:53:56.379 --> 02:53:59.361]  Oh, shut up, you KKK member.
[02:53:59.361 --> 02:54:01.963]  I heard Tom Brokaw say you were a Nazi.
[02:54:03.010 --> 02:54:04.911]  Really, did Tom Brokaw show a clip of that?
[02:54:04.911 --> 02:54:05.131]  No!
[02:54:05.131 --> 02:54:07.993]  Because Tom Brokaw is a joke!
[02:54:07.993 --> 02:54:13.297]  He looks just like George W. Bush now, he's like... Tom Brokaw here?
[02:54:13.297 --> 02:54:16.078]  Hey, I got a word racist!
[02:54:16.078 --> 02:54:17.799]  He a racist!
[02:54:17.799 --> 02:54:21.662]  Right here, over here!
[02:54:21.662 --> 02:54:22.883]  Oh, not Tom Brokaw!
[02:54:22.883 --> 02:54:23.983]  Dun, dun, dun!
[02:54:23.983 --> 02:54:26.245]  It's kind of like in Gladiator.
[02:54:26.245 --> 02:54:29.547]  He's already beaten all the other Gladiators, so they bring a guy out of retirement.
[02:54:31.252 --> 02:54:32.132]  We're good to go.
[02:54:55.675 --> 02:54:57.877]  Blue-blooded baboon, it must be true.
[02:54:57.877 --> 02:55:05.181]  Tom Brokaw just called me a Chinese jet pilot that dropped out of a baboon's butt.
[02:55:05.181 --> 02:55:07.283]  Look at the smugness of him.
[02:55:07.283 --> 02:55:11.826]  He's got that same narcissistic mental patient look that George W. Bush has.
[02:55:11.826 --> 02:55:14.007]  I'm successful!
[02:55:14.007 --> 02:55:17.330]  I'm somebody!
[02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:20.852]  Alright, they did get the club, Intrepid Crew.
[02:55:22.242 --> 02:55:28.065]  Here's a clip of them saying, um, seeing and investigating Clinton is what happens in authoritarian countries.
[02:55:28.065 --> 02:55:35.488]  They're investigating Trump, made up crap, shut down the press, arrest Alex Jones, but when we say investigate them, oh, that's authoritarianism.
[02:55:35.488 --> 02:55:37.549]  Here it is.
[02:55:37.549 --> 02:55:39.010]  You have to also do it in context.
[02:55:39.010 --> 02:55:41.391]  Back November 22nd.
[02:55:41.391 --> 02:55:41.951]  That's Cuomo.
[02:55:41.951 --> 02:55:43.772]  Remember, we're allowed to read WikiLeaks.
[02:55:43.772 --> 02:55:46.113]  He said, you're not, and if you do, we'll arrest you.
[02:55:46.113 --> 02:55:47.394]  Sorry, let me get back to Cuomo.
[02:55:47.394 --> 02:55:49.515]  He also said, let your daughter shower.
[02:55:50.638 --> 02:55:52.639]  You have to also do it in context.
[02:55:52.639 --> 02:55:57.621]  Back November 22nd, after the election, the President was asked about this.
[02:55:57.621 --> 02:55:59.221]  Are you going to go after the Clintons?
[02:55:59.221 --> 02:56:02.483]  Because you kept saying you were going to do it all during the election.
[02:56:02.483 --> 02:56:03.183]  Here's what he said.
[02:56:15.086 --> 02:56:17.127]  Well, when it goes up, I'll read it.
[02:56:17.127 --> 02:56:19.107]  So, look, I want to move forward.
[02:56:19.107 --> 02:56:20.187]  I don't want to move back.
[02:56:20.187 --> 02:56:21.408]  And I don't want to hurt the Clintons.
[02:56:21.408 --> 02:56:22.248]  I really don't.
[02:56:22.248 --> 02:56:23.488]  She went through a lot.
[02:56:23.488 --> 02:56:24.488]  And suffered.
[02:56:24.488 --> 02:56:25.169]  Greatly.
[02:56:25.169 --> 02:56:26.389]  In many different ways.
[02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:27.529]  And I'm not looking to hurt them at all.
[02:56:27.529 --> 02:56:29.230]  Yeah, that's him trying to be gracious.
[02:56:29.230 --> 02:56:32.951]  By the way, pause.
[02:56:32.951 --> 02:56:36.772]  I told him days before that, they're going to play possum and come at your neck, sir.
[02:56:36.772 --> 02:56:38.492]  And I told him that about ten more times.
[02:56:40.521 --> 02:56:43.302]  And now, the President does listen to what I say, even more.
[02:56:43.302 --> 02:56:45.082]  Because every bit of it came true.
[02:56:45.082 --> 02:56:46.962]  Sorry, let's go back to Cuomo.
[02:56:46.962 --> 02:56:52.704]  Well, because of what's been going on with him, Jeffrey Toobin, do we see a very different posture now being motivated by the U.S.
[02:56:52.704 --> 02:56:54.444]  Department of Justice?
[02:56:54.444 --> 02:56:58.105]  You know, I don't want to be Chicken Little, but you know what?
[02:56:58.105 --> 02:57:07.007]  This is what happens in authoritarian countries like Turkey and Russia, that when a party takes power, they start criminally investigating their opponents.
[02:57:07.515 --> 02:57:09.137]  I mean, that's what this is.
[02:57:09.137 --> 02:57:10.458]  That's what you've been doing to Trump.
[02:57:10.458 --> 02:57:12.681]  It hasn't happened as you just pointed out, Chris.
[02:57:12.681 --> 02:57:17.506]  But, you know, we're talking about the Clinton Foundation back in the 90s and 80s.
[02:57:17.506 --> 02:57:18.667]  This is the 90s.
[02:57:18.667 --> 02:57:20.349]  It's ongoing now.
[02:57:20.349 --> 02:57:22.771]  They just robbed Haiti of all the money.
[02:57:22.771 --> 02:57:24.173]  Again, they've just done it.
[02:57:24.173 --> 02:57:25.034]  They've started it.
[02:57:25.034 --> 02:57:26.435]  They've done it.
[02:57:26.435 --> 02:57:26.756]  And then...
[02:57:28.147 --> 02:57:33.169]  It turns around on them, and they're just totally freaking out, going, this is authoritarian!
[02:57:33.169 --> 02:57:33.909]  Stop it!
[02:57:33.909 --> 02:57:35.730]  Fourth hour coming up with the new Clinton footage.
[02:57:35.730 --> 02:57:37.471]  Hillary having to be helped up.
[02:57:37.471 --> 02:57:39.431]  She can't even set up exclusive footage.
[02:57:39.431 --> 02:57:40.432]  Hour number four.
[02:57:40.432 --> 02:57:40.912]  It's huge.

[02:59:47.205 --> 02:59:49.867]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:54.535 --> 02:59:56.276]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:56.276 --> 02:59:58.477]  Thanksgiving.
[02:59:58.477 --> 03:00:02.018]  One of the few true Americana holidays that we've got.
[03:00:02.018 --> 03:00:04.219]  Probably my favorite holiday.
[03:00:04.219 --> 03:00:07.220]  The 23rd day of November 2017.
[03:00:07.220 --> 03:00:13.122]  We've seen total demonization of the Italian Christopher Columbus.
[03:00:13.122 --> 03:00:15.463]  We've seen the total demonization of Thanksgiving.
[03:00:15.463 --> 03:00:19.585]  We've seen attempts to get rid of the holiday.
[03:00:19.585 --> 03:00:20.345]  To use it to
[03:00:21.309 --> 03:00:28.695]  Cash dispersions on Western civilization and Western expansion that undoubtedly was a mess.
[03:00:28.695 --> 03:00:30.897]  And there were crimes on all sides.
[03:00:30.897 --> 03:00:40.324]  When I say all sides, it wasn't just the settlers, or it wasn't just the troops, or it wasn't just the empires, or it wasn't just all the different native tribes.
[03:00:40.324 --> 03:00:50.172]  It was all of those different countless changing factions that played into this long before white men colonized
[03:00:51.733 --> 03:00:58.078]  North America, the Vikings certainly visited it for a thousand years before Christopher Columbus supposedly discovered it.
[03:00:58.078 --> 03:01:00.459]  That's now documented.
[03:01:00.459 --> 03:01:15.250]  But long before white men ever colonized it, all the native tribes did was run around and try to dominate and control each other and take over and kill the men and then take the women and the children.
[03:01:15.931 --> 03:01:25.835]  The same stuff that was going on in Europe for 10,000 years, the same stuff going on in Africa for 10,000 years, the same stuff going on everywhere in the world.
[03:01:25.835 --> 03:01:28.637]  Humans acted the same.
[03:01:28.637 --> 03:01:37.721]  And so, we never see big pieces being done on the bad things that the Native Americans did, or the way they behaved.
[03:01:37.721 --> 03:01:41.502]  Because it's not part of the liberation theology.
[03:01:41.502 --> 03:01:45.224]  Starting in the 50s, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment,
[03:01:45.848 --> 03:01:56.145]  Created liberation theology where they thought that Jesus would have fought back and was a revolutionary and hated capitalism and was a communist.
[03:01:56.145 --> 03:01:56.706]  And so they got
[03:01:58.217 --> 03:02:05.101]  The different populations that were Christian, poor, black, Hispanic, you name it, to become liberation theologists.
[03:02:05.101 --> 03:02:06.162]  And that was just one part of it.
[03:02:06.162 --> 03:02:26.253]  But to teach that in the schools to everybody that America was bad, the founders were bad, this was an undermining of the nation state and our ethos, where we came from, so that people of color particularly wouldn't have a idea in their head that they had a right to the American birthright, or that they'd been part
[03:02:27.043 --> 03:02:30.004]  Critical parts of this great saga.
[03:02:30.004 --> 03:02:30.704]  No.
[03:02:30.704 --> 03:02:34.805]  It's all just, you were good, but you were exploited, and the whites were bad.
[03:02:34.805 --> 03:02:46.269]  When it was way more complex, with whites that were indentured servants, and bounties, and people basically as slaves, and company stores, and sharecroppers.
[03:02:46.269 --> 03:02:49.610]  But they just continue to play on the incredible ignorance of the public.
[03:02:49.610 --> 03:02:54.872]  The last few weeks, CNN claims they've broken the news that there's slave auctions in Libya.
[03:02:54.872 --> 03:02:55.732]  Broken the news?
[03:02:57.248 --> 03:03:04.415]  In seven different Muslim countries, they sell women on top slave blocks, you know, up on a stage.
[03:03:04.415 --> 03:03:05.256]  And it's all known.
[03:03:05.256 --> 03:03:06.557]  It's Muslims doing it.
[03:03:06.557 --> 03:03:15.566]  But all these reports from CNN breaking, you know, this supposed news that we've been talking about forever and others have been documenting.
[03:03:15.566 --> 03:03:20.030]  It's about, oh, the poor migrants, the poor babies, the poor, the poor migrants.
[03:03:20.030 --> 03:03:21.091]  These are people in Africa.
[03:03:21.880 --> 03:03:30.651]  That are being kidnapped and grabbed and sold into slavery by Muslims, but somehow they turn it into quote Muslims by using the term migrant.
[03:03:30.651 --> 03:03:34.616]  That's the new definition of Muslims is a migrant never a Muslim invader.
[03:03:34.616 --> 03:03:40.803]  So they take Muslims of slaving people and then turn it into the catch-all word of poor little Muslims.
[03:03:40.803 --> 03:03:41.464]  Which is migrant.
[03:03:43.075 --> 03:03:45.696]  So they know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:45.696 --> 03:03:48.517]  But we're going to be covering that a lot more here during the transmission.
[03:03:48.517 --> 03:03:51.658]  But I'm proud of Thanksgiving, and I give thanks to you, the audience.
[03:03:51.658 --> 03:03:52.618]  Thanks to God.
[03:03:52.618 --> 03:03:53.439]  Thanks to my family.
[03:03:53.439 --> 03:03:55.319]  Thanks to the great crew.
[03:03:55.319 --> 03:03:57.440]  And I just want to thank you all for what you've done.
[03:03:57.440 --> 03:04:01.161]  We have extended the specials from earlier in the week, as we planned to do.
[03:04:01.161 --> 03:04:03.602]  But we have new specials that are added each day.
[03:04:03.602 --> 03:04:06.683]  And X2 is 50% off.
[03:04:06.683 --> 03:04:08.444]  Super high quality.
[03:04:08.444 --> 03:04:09.504]  Just absolutely
[03:04:10.814 --> 03:04:11.134]  Needed!
[03:04:29.068 --> 03:04:30.328]  A bunch of stuff is there.
[03:04:30.328 --> 03:04:31.649]  Biggest sales ever.
[03:04:31.649 --> 03:04:36.970]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:04:36.970 --> 03:04:39.930]  Again, I want to thank you all for what you've done.
[03:04:39.930 --> 03:04:43.671]  I want to thank you all for your victory, breaking your conditioning against the Globalist.
[03:04:43.671 --> 03:04:53.293]  I want to encourage you all to keep supporting the broadcast by purchasing high-quality products at Infowarsstore.com, which is a win-win for everybody because they're high-quality, and it helps fund this operation.
[03:04:53.293 --> 03:04:54.473]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:54.473 --> 03:04:56.374]  I'm driving home here.
[03:04:56.374 --> 03:04:58.654]  About to take off a few days for Thanksgiving.
[03:05:00.391 --> 03:05:07.576]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am.
[03:05:07.576 --> 03:05:17.882]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action, and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other nations.
[03:05:17.882 --> 03:05:27.328]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure
[03:05:28.684 --> 03:05:33.245]  Power, cult, will to dominate and control society.
[03:05:33.245 --> 03:05:38.346]  And that we have come so far with God's help, and have turned the tide, but the enemy's tracking back.
[03:05:38.346 --> 03:05:43.427]  So just, please, we should all be so thankful to God, and thankful to each other for taking action.
[03:05:43.427 --> 03:05:49.328]  But also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead, because history is happening.
[03:05:49.328 --> 03:05:51.989]  So for myself, and my family, God bless you all.
[03:05:51.989 --> 03:05:52.809]  Have a great Thanksgiving.
[03:06:04.478 --> 03:06:07.160]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:06:07.160 --> 03:06:10.182]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:06:10.182 --> 03:06:22.610]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.610 --> 03:06:25.592]  Okay, Mike Cernovich is co-hosting with us in this fourth hour.
[03:06:25.592 --> 03:06:28.835]  We're getting him connected right now.
[03:06:28.835 --> 03:06:30.636]  The footage you're about to see is really important because
[03:06:31.440 --> 03:06:32.521]  We're going to have even more footage.
[03:06:32.521 --> 03:06:33.721]  This just happened like an hour ago.
[03:06:33.721 --> 03:06:40.405]  Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz, the camera guy, both of them intrepid reporters, just got back to the mothership here in Austin, Texas.
[03:06:40.405 --> 03:06:41.826]  Hillary was here in Austin today.
[03:06:41.826 --> 03:06:44.327]  Millie Weaver, our reporter, will give you the details.
[03:06:44.327 --> 03:06:46.488]  She's also going to be up in Dallas now.
[03:06:46.488 --> 03:06:49.550]  And we first got the reports from the Secret Service last year.
[03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:54.292]  Uh, that Hillary was having convulsions every 45 minutes and had a black ambulance.
[03:06:54.292 --> 03:06:59.335]  And that we should tell our listeners and everybody else to follow her around and get her on video.
[03:06:59.335 --> 03:07:00.836]  That she had a medical tent as well.
[03:07:00.836 --> 03:07:05.839]  Well, a couple weeks later, Million Gavin in Cleveland, Ohio caught her in a medical tent for an hour.
[03:07:05.839 --> 03:07:07.460]  Emergency stretchers, people running through.
[03:07:07.460 --> 03:07:08.660]  We have that video.
[03:07:08.660 --> 03:07:16.785]  A week later on September 11th, a month after we broke this news that she was having convulsions every 45 minutes, she fell down on 9-11 in New York.
[03:07:16.785 --> 03:07:18.406]  The media only showed her wobbling
[03:07:19.668 --> 03:07:21.909]  Didn't show the fall and said we made it up.
[03:07:21.909 --> 03:07:25.790]  But despite the fact they pulled it off the internet, the video kept getting uploaded.
[03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:26.890]  They had to back off.
[03:07:26.890 --> 03:07:29.531]  That was a real waterloo for mainstream media.
[03:07:29.531 --> 03:07:30.571]  So you went down there today.
[03:07:30.571 --> 03:07:32.572]  I don't know if you're wearing your Bill Clinton red shirt.
[03:07:32.572 --> 03:07:33.012]  I was.
[03:07:33.012 --> 03:07:36.173]  I most definitely was and I triggered a lot of people.
[03:07:36.173 --> 03:07:36.993]  You would not even believe.
[03:07:37.353 --> 03:07:45.095]  There were a lot of Austin liberals out there lined up to see Hillary Clinton, and she was very secretive and elusive.
[03:07:45.095 --> 03:07:55.037]  When she even first pulled up, they had a garage that would shut so that you wouldn't capture or see her getting out of her car as to maybe hide if she were to stumble or fall.
[03:07:55.037 --> 03:07:55.918]  You never know.
[03:07:57.618 --> 03:07:58.599]  Very handled.
[03:07:58.599 --> 03:08:02.102]  You had her whole staff there, like a bunch of cult members.
[03:08:02.102 --> 03:08:05.164]  And yes, I did get harassed by her staff.
[03:08:05.164 --> 03:08:07.065]  They were stalking me, following me around.
[03:08:07.065 --> 03:08:11.488]  One of the private security was even pushing up into me, and I had to keep telling him, stop.
[03:08:11.488 --> 03:08:12.549]  I do not want you touching me.
[03:08:12.549 --> 03:08:18.894]  And by the way, by next hour, you guys just got back in the last 45 minutes, you'll have all the video downloaded and ready for the war room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:08:18.894 --> 03:08:21.236]  You're going to be able to show all this.
[03:08:21.236 --> 03:08:25.679]  But you were telling me that they call the Austin cops, but the Austin cops, when they got there, what happened?
[03:08:25.979 --> 03:08:28.081]  Yeah, I was like, please call the police.
[03:08:28.081 --> 03:08:29.262]  We're on a public sidewalk.
[03:08:29.262 --> 03:08:33.066]  I'm allowed to be here talking to people that consent to talk with me.
[03:08:33.066 --> 03:08:33.807]  And guess what?
[03:08:33.807 --> 03:08:43.175]  They brought the police, and the police were totally cordial, and they ended up telling Hillary's psychotic staff, cult member staff, to back off.
[03:08:43.175 --> 03:08:44.216]  You can't be in my space.
[03:08:44.216 --> 03:08:46.979]  You can't be touching me and pushing your body up against me.
[03:08:46.979 --> 03:08:51.123]  Yeah, this is Texas, and I'm sorry to say, I did in New York, where the police a lot of times will actually back
[03:08:51.643 --> 03:08:53.324]  The Democrats, you know, being anti-free speech.
[03:08:53.324 --> 03:09:02.031]  And of course, people can't see it on radio, but you have the rape shirt down there of Bill Clinton, which became iconic in the election.
[03:09:02.031 --> 03:09:06.914]  And we had the contest exposing Bill Clinton as a rapist that probably turned the tide of the election.
[03:09:06.914 --> 03:09:09.436]  It was our audience taking action that did that.
[03:09:09.436 --> 03:09:18.162]  But alone, you having her coming out of a deal and them holding her up and holding her by the arms, clearly not just guiding her, but holding her up thinking she may fall any minute.
[03:09:18.502 --> 03:09:25.477]  It fits into the photos of her being helped up the stairs, or her falling down on her face, or her being helped out of the vehicle, or in the vehicle.
[03:09:26.281 --> 03:09:30.722]  Donna Brazile saying they looked at replacing her with Joe Biden because of her health.
[03:09:30.722 --> 03:09:50.727]  And you know they had people stopping the front of the line from coming into the building so they were waiting for Hillary to get out of her vehicle so that they can then have her stumble her way into her chair in her seat and then allow people in so that she could be sitting in a stationary position while she's signing and autographing books and essentially
[03:09:51.367 --> 03:09:54.009]  You know, we're seeing somebody having to literally lift her.
[03:09:54.009 --> 03:09:57.371]  It looks like the guy is lifting her up out of the car.
[03:09:57.371 --> 03:09:59.533]  And again, they tried to hide around the corner.
[03:09:59.533 --> 03:10:01.654]  They tried to hide inside where they parked her.
[03:10:01.654 --> 03:10:03.155]  They're being very, very secretive.
[03:10:03.155 --> 03:10:09.019]  Just like the Secret Service told us, there is a black ambulance vehicle that she uses.
[03:10:09.019 --> 03:10:12.101]  Now, have we gotten Mike Cernovich on yet?
[03:10:14.381 --> 03:10:19.749]  OK, great, because I want to get Mike Cernovich's take on this before we go to the footage.
[03:10:19.749 --> 03:10:21.331]  He's supposed to be hosting this hour.
[03:10:21.331 --> 03:10:25.256]  I appreciate him letting us run into what he's doing at Cernovich on Twitter.
[03:10:25.256 --> 03:10:27.319]  Mike, we've been on this from day one.
[03:10:27.319 --> 03:10:28.781]  Obviously, we see the whole collapse.
[03:10:29.241 --> 03:10:29.601]  Of course not.
[03:10:50.302 --> 03:10:57.207]  Yeah, and then she broke her foot by tripping down the stairs, the multiple falls, the Scooby van.
[03:10:57.207 --> 03:11:01.951]  People can go back and see that you and I and others have talked about the Scooby van.
[03:11:01.951 --> 03:11:06.134]  And they call this, of course, a conspiracy theory and even worse.
[03:11:06.134 --> 03:11:08.296]  But that was from Secret Service sourcing.
[03:11:08.296 --> 03:11:12.519]  Everybody knows within her, because again, it's all a drill.
[03:11:12.519 --> 03:11:13.500]  It's all orchestrated.
[03:11:14.713 --> 03:11:15.494]  Well, that's right.
[03:11:15.494 --> 03:11:21.399]  And even at her campaign events the last few months of last year, they would all circle her and the crowd was in on it.
[03:11:21.399 --> 03:11:23.321]  I mean, we now learn we were vindicated.
[03:11:23.321 --> 03:11:24.482]  This is true.
[03:11:24.482 --> 03:11:25.703]  This is happening.
[03:11:25.703 --> 03:11:30.507]  You know, Donna Brazile also talked about how cult-like Hillary Clinton's staff is.
[03:11:30.507 --> 03:11:34.731]  And I can attest to you that I've been to multiple rallies, multiple Clinton-speaking events.
[03:11:34.731 --> 03:11:35.812]  They're extremely cult-like.
[03:11:35.812 --> 03:11:41.657]  And even today, they were cult-like in the way they harassed me, stalked me, told me I needed to leave while I'm on a public sidewalk.
[03:11:41.957 --> 03:11:49.940]  They're cult-like, just like Donna Brazile said, so why wouldn't Donna Brazile's testimony on Hillary Clinton's ill health also be correct?
[03:11:49.940 --> 03:11:54.783]  And again, if you're a TV viewer, we are rolling this video here, and we have it slowed down.
[03:11:54.783 --> 03:12:02.066]  There she is, literally, it looks like being held up, her arm, and then she's like, oh look, there's cameras, so they take their hand off.
[03:12:02.066 --> 03:12:03.786]  Do you see they're shutting the gates?
[03:12:03.786 --> 03:12:08.408]  They were trying to shut the gates and hide her completely walking into the event.
[03:12:08.408 --> 03:12:09.809]  They did not want people getting caught.
[03:12:10.510 --> 03:12:11.931]  I haven't even seen this yet.
[03:12:11.931 --> 03:12:12.551]  It's brand new.
[03:12:12.551 --> 03:12:14.292]  You're seeing it for the first time.
[03:12:14.292 --> 03:12:14.812]  Wow.
[03:12:14.812 --> 03:12:15.613]  Yeah, no.
[03:12:15.613 --> 03:12:32.421]  I thought, because I saw earlier on Twitter that Hillary had still been traveling in her big Scooby van and they were walking her behind the van while a bunch of fans were surrounding her, and as you know that that was standard operating procedure was they would say never let anybody get her on camera.
[03:12:32.421 --> 03:12:33.962]  And by the way, where is that on Twitter, Mike?
[03:12:33.962 --> 03:12:35.023]  Is that Ed Cernovich?
[03:12:35.023 --> 03:12:35.763]  Did you retweet that?
[03:12:35.763 --> 03:12:38.504]  We want to show that right now to give us different angles of what happened.
[03:12:38.504 --> 03:12:38.945]  Show it.
[03:12:38.945 --> 03:12:39.385]  Tell us where to go.
[03:12:40.299 --> 03:12:40.719]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:12:40.719 --> 03:12:49.346]  So Jack Posobiec had that on his Twitter account, where it shows Hillary being escorted to the back of her big Scooby van.
[03:12:49.346 --> 03:13:00.394]  And I thought that was the video we were talking about, because as we know, the media doesn't go behind the van, because that's when they have to lift her up and prop her up.
[03:13:00.394 --> 03:13:06.038]  So if you ever watch footage of her getting into the van, they always escort her to the other side, away from the camera.
[03:13:06.038 --> 03:13:07.579]  Sure, and you see them in the shot.
[03:13:08.268 --> 03:13:13.020]  As they're trying to close the gate, she's like, hey, look, and they're holding her up and then they take their hand off.
[03:13:13.020 --> 03:13:14.443]  I mean, this is she is really ill.
[03:13:16.184 --> 03:13:17.124]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:13:17.124 --> 03:13:19.185]  So, yeah, I didn't even, I hadn't even seen that video.
[03:13:19.185 --> 03:13:25.268]  I thought you were talking about this other video that I'm looking for and I'll retweet so that it's at the top.
[03:13:25.268 --> 03:13:27.029]  Yeah, this, this is startling, actually.
[03:13:27.029 --> 03:13:28.110]  Can we watch that video?
[03:13:28.110 --> 03:13:32.912]  Yes, let's roll that video again for TV viewers, radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:13:32.912 --> 03:13:35.053]  This was literally shot like an hour and a half ago.
[03:13:35.053 --> 03:13:42.997]  Millie got back like an hour ago and you can see it where they are holding her, not, not just touching her on the arm, but holding her up under the elbow.
[03:13:42.997 --> 03:13:43.937]  She sees it.
[03:13:43.937 --> 03:13:45.358]  So they start closing the gate.
[03:13:45.898 --> 03:13:46.198]  I don't know.
[03:14:01.619 --> 03:14:05.142]  Yank you up by your arm, you know?
[03:14:05.142 --> 03:14:07.144]  She needed help, obviously, getting out.
[03:14:07.144 --> 03:14:10.147]  Yeah, we found the video, so I retweeted it to my timeline.
[03:14:10.147 --> 03:14:18.094]  So, as you can see, they're escorting her to the back of the van because they don't want to see anybody have her lift her up.
[03:14:18.094 --> 03:14:20.076]  So, it's amazing.
[03:14:20.076 --> 03:14:22.438]  We're going to show that when we come back from break.
[03:14:22.438 --> 03:14:23.159]  Here's the footage.
[03:14:23.159 --> 03:14:26.282]  Hillary's still traveling in what appears to be a modified van.
[03:14:26.582 --> 03:14:27.662]  I mean, look at her hobbling out.
[03:14:27.662 --> 03:14:28.422]  She's got a boot on.
[03:14:28.422 --> 03:14:29.302]  Oh, wow.
[03:14:29.302 --> 03:14:31.483]  Gavin, we have footage of that boot, too.
[03:14:31.483 --> 03:14:32.243]  So there's the boot.
[03:14:32.243 --> 03:14:35.404]  I mean, she looks like she's a person in a nursing home.
[03:14:35.404 --> 03:14:36.564]  And then there's the ambulance.
[03:14:36.564 --> 03:14:38.524]  There's the black ambulance.
[03:14:38.524 --> 03:14:42.245]  And then she still thinks she's going to run for office in a couple of years.
[03:14:42.245 --> 03:14:44.965]  Well, she's walking with a limp.
[03:14:44.965 --> 03:14:47.726]  Donna Brazile even came out saying she has ill health.
[03:14:47.726 --> 03:14:48.986]  Well, Mike Cernovich, great job, Millie.
[03:14:48.986 --> 03:14:52.926]  I'm going to let you get all the new footage ready for the war room coming up in about 45 minutes.
[03:14:52.926 --> 03:14:54.347]  But I want you to be able to take over.
[03:14:54.347 --> 03:14:55.867]  Well, what else is coming up, Mike Cernovich?
[03:14:57.308 --> 03:14:57.928]  Oh, I didn't know.
[03:14:57.928 --> 03:14:59.889]  I thought I was riding shotgun or you were riding shotgun.
[03:14:59.889 --> 03:15:01.329]  We'll be happy to ride shotgun if you want.
[03:15:01.329 --> 03:15:02.489]  We just don't want to hog your hour.
[03:15:02.489 --> 03:15:03.150]  You've got a lot to cover.
[03:15:03.150 --> 03:15:04.510]  No, no, no.
[03:15:04.510 --> 03:15:07.711]  I like the panel discussions anyway because I haven't seen that video.
[03:15:07.711 --> 03:15:10.431]  Tell us what you want to get into then in the next 45 minutes.
[03:15:10.431 --> 03:15:14.312]  Yeah, well, you know, I think that video that you drew on was big.
[03:15:14.312 --> 03:15:17.833]  I think that the sexual harassment scandals are big.
[03:15:17.833 --> 03:15:19.674]  The Hollywood stuff is big.
[03:15:19.674 --> 03:15:21.234]  I mean, there's so much to talk about, man.
[03:15:21.234 --> 03:15:22.174]  Sure, but let me just say this.
[03:15:22.174 --> 03:15:24.095]  I hadn't seen the footage that Posobiec just put out.
[03:15:25.166 --> 03:15:27.868]  I mean, clearly, she's being helped out by them there.
[03:15:27.868 --> 03:15:29.729]  I mean, I'm not being mean.
[03:15:29.729 --> 03:15:30.769]  My grandma just died.
[03:15:30.769 --> 03:15:33.971]  The point is, she looks like a nursing home person.
[03:15:33.971 --> 03:15:36.312]  And the point is, this is the elite's creature?
[03:15:36.312 --> 03:15:39.374]  And then Bill Clinton looks like the Crypt Keeper?
[03:15:39.374 --> 03:15:42.396]  I mean, it's like Cousin Lurch.
[03:15:42.396 --> 03:15:44.277]  We'll talk about it all with Millie Weaver.
[03:15:44.277 --> 03:15:45.238]  Mike Cernovich and more.
[03:15:45.238 --> 03:15:46.418]  They're getting all the footage ready.
[03:15:46.418 --> 03:15:47.599]  We got a bunch of it.
[03:15:47.599 --> 03:15:50.281]  Hillary having to be held up in Austin, Texas.
[03:15:50.281 --> 03:15:50.781]  Stay with us.

[03:18:38.285 --> 03:18:41.748]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[03:18:41.748 --> 03:18:42.889]  It is an act of war.
[03:18:42.889 --> 03:18:44.931]  It is an act of standing up.
[03:18:44.931 --> 03:18:50.476]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[03:18:52.859 --> 03:19:03.027]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of a giant time bomb.
[03:19:03.027 --> 03:19:11.394]  With populations, and globalism, and the New World Order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy.
[03:19:11.394 --> 03:19:13.336]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[03:19:13.991 --> 03:19:17.255]  We've also got to have rear-guard actions to be prepared.
[03:19:17.255 --> 03:19:21.239]  The number one thing, after getting right with God, is to have high-quality, storable food.
[03:19:21.239 --> 03:19:27.326]  Well, the entire line of My Patriot Supply Foods, private-labeled as MFOR Select, is now 50% off.
[03:19:27.326 --> 03:19:30.630]  We've only done that one time before previously.

[03:19:31.330 --> 03:19:32.351]  You cannot beat that.
[03:19:33.092 --> 03:19:36.355]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:21.804 --> 03:20:28.947]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:20:28.947 --> 03:20:31.087]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:31.087 --> 03:20:32.648]  And Mike Cernovich and Millie Weaver.
[03:20:32.648 --> 03:20:34.368]  Millie just got back like an hour ago.
[03:20:34.368 --> 03:20:35.909]  There's more footage coming up this hour.
[03:20:35.909 --> 03:20:41.211]  More footage on the war room with Owen Troyer and Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich is one of the contributors as well.
[03:20:41.211 --> 03:20:42.791]  Mike Cernovich is hosting this hour.
[03:20:42.791 --> 03:20:47.893]  I'm getting out of this segment even though I'm invited because I gotta go look at all the rest of this footage and I'm gonna be listening to Mike.
[03:20:47.893 --> 03:20:49.974]  But if you missed it,
[03:20:50.962 --> 03:20:51.722]  Here's the footage.
[03:20:51.722 --> 03:20:58.364]  You tie this in with all of her other collapsing, that she still has the ambulance, that she's hobbling around with a boot on.
[03:20:58.364 --> 03:21:01.885]  I mean, she looks like she is basically living in a nursing home.
[03:21:01.885 --> 03:21:03.726]  And look, look, she's an evil woman.
[03:21:03.726 --> 03:21:05.547]  They tried to cover up her illnesses.
[03:21:05.547 --> 03:21:06.487]  We're slowing this footage down.
[03:21:07.202 --> 03:21:14.267]  There was one car, Millie was saying, behind the motorcade that got in late, so they were able to close the gates to cover up what was happening.
[03:21:14.267 --> 03:21:15.528]  Let's back that up again.
[03:21:15.528 --> 03:21:25.656]  And Millie and her cameraman, Gavin Wentz, caught it on tape as she's being lifted out of the black ambulance, which is a mobile ambulance, but black, so you don't know it's a black ambulance.
[03:21:25.656 --> 03:21:27.577]  This is simply incredible.
[03:21:27.577 --> 03:21:32.681]  Millie, tell us about this video, narrate this for radio listeners, and what else you saw.
[03:21:33.314 --> 03:21:41.080]  Well, you could tell that by the way they were having her come into the back end of the bookstore, they were trying to have it very discreet and private.
[03:21:41.080 --> 03:21:43.962]  They even had gates that they could shut so that you wouldn't see it.
[03:21:43.962 --> 03:21:53.729]  But like you were saying, there was a tail end of the motorcade that came in late, had some problems trying to, weaseling through, shimmying through the gate, and that's what allowed us to capture this footage.
[03:21:53.729 --> 03:21:57.212]  But she could have clearly been dropped off at the very front entrance
[03:21:57.592 --> 03:21:57.932]  That's right.
[03:22:17.922 --> 03:22:19.763]  And you've been on her tail, you and Gavin.
[03:22:19.763 --> 03:22:22.705]  That's right, and her staff was so cult-like.
[03:22:22.705 --> 03:22:23.946]  I mean, look at them all standing around.
[03:22:23.946 --> 03:22:28.669]  I mean, obviously you have people there, but this guy here, he was one of the ones that followed me around.
[03:22:28.669 --> 03:22:38.716]  The guy with the beard followed me around the entire time where I was, along with that other security guy in the green, and they were the ones harassing, following me, pushing their body up against me.
[03:22:39.056 --> 03:22:40.537]  And what did the Austin police say to him?
[03:22:40.537 --> 03:22:42.378]  The Austin police told him to stop.
[03:22:42.378 --> 03:22:45.420]  They said, you know, you need to keep a distance from her.
[03:22:45.420 --> 03:22:57.647]  And I was very grateful for the Austin police and even Hillary Clinton's crazed female staff members that came and told me I had to leave right now because I was harassing and hurting people's feelings and offending people.
[03:22:57.647 --> 03:23:04.631]  They didn't seem to care that these guys were kind of manhandling me in a way and that they threatened, we're going to call the police.
[03:23:04.631 --> 03:23:06.492]  I said, please do call the police because
[03:23:07.242 --> 03:23:08.364]  You know, I'm allowed to be here.
[03:23:08.364 --> 03:23:09.265]  This is the public place.
[03:23:09.265 --> 03:23:14.793]  Well, this is Hillary again, like the Secret Service told us over a year ago, having to be lifted out of vehicles.
[03:23:14.793 --> 03:23:18.338]  Mike Cernovich, the Don of Brazil, all of it coming out.
[03:23:18.338 --> 03:23:20.120]  The establishment turning against the Clintons.
[03:23:20.120 --> 03:23:21.262]  What does this signify to you?
[03:23:22.563 --> 03:23:35.408]  Well, I would like to know if the media, the New York Times, is going to report that a female journalist, Millie Weaver, was potentially assaulted in a major attack on the free press by Hillary Clinton's people.
[03:23:35.408 --> 03:23:44.331]  I think that's very interesting that it's okay for a conservative or independent journalist to be manhandled by Hillary Clinton's operatives.
[03:23:44.331 --> 03:23:48.253]  By Hillary's goons, who we know have gone after women before that have been abused by Bill Clinton.
[03:23:49.153 --> 03:23:50.634]  And it's not the first time.
[03:23:50.634 --> 03:23:51.294]  It's not the first time.
[03:23:51.294 --> 03:23:56.798]  I've been to her other rallies during the campaign season, and her staff was always really crazy and attacking me.
[03:23:56.798 --> 03:23:58.359]  Mike, what does this signify to you, though?
[03:23:58.359 --> 03:24:00.260]  The whole establishment turning against the Clintons.
[03:24:00.260 --> 03:24:02.462]  What does that signify?
[03:24:02.462 --> 03:24:14.850]  Well, they're trying to regain the moral high ground which they lost by defending Anthony Weiner, Al Franken, Frankenstein's monster, Kevin Spacey, Weinstein, the whole thing.
[03:24:14.850 --> 03:24:18.472]  And they know that they realized, hey, we can't falsely accuse
[03:24:19.375 --> 03:24:26.397]  Right-wing people of stuff, if the real accusations against our people aren't addressed either.
[03:24:26.397 --> 03:24:29.257]  So now they're going, well, Bill Clinton, he's old, he's senile.
[03:24:29.257 --> 03:24:31.518]  Hillary Clinton, she has Parkinson's.
[03:24:31.518 --> 03:24:32.958]  Who, you know, or whatever.
[03:24:32.958 --> 03:24:42.380]  Donna Brazile, by the way, confirmed again, I've never gotten an apology, confirmed that doctors who liked Hillary were actually emailing about her health.
[03:24:42.380 --> 03:24:44.501]  But again, the fake news media doesn't want to cover that.
[03:24:44.501 --> 03:24:48.842]  Well, they fired one doctor that went public and said, listen, I'm not against her, but
[03:24:49.409 --> 03:24:52.151]  You know, this lady's got serious medical problems.
[03:24:52.151 --> 03:24:54.632]  Yeah, Dr. Drew lost his whole show.
[03:24:54.632 --> 03:24:55.172]  Remember that?
[03:24:55.172 --> 03:24:57.014]  I mean, the cover-up!
[03:24:57.014 --> 03:25:06.259]  It really shows how high the cover-up goes, as Dr. Drew, very popular, he's a liberal, by the way, he's not one of us, and he just said, wow, there's something wrong here.
[03:25:06.259 --> 03:25:06.979]  Boom.
[03:25:06.979 --> 03:25:07.880]  Show cancelled.
[03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:08.941]  The machine!
[03:25:08.941 --> 03:25:10.522]  That's what they would do to protect the clip.
[03:25:10.522 --> 03:25:17.786]  But the Clintons aren't giving up, and their minions aren't, so when you've got an immovable object comes into the unstoppable force, you get explosions.
[03:25:19.196 --> 03:25:26.761]  Exactly, but now that the Clintons lack power, they're saying, well, we'll just throw Bill Clinton away because he can't raise money for us.
[03:25:26.761 --> 03:25:35.588]  Even Senator Gilbrand, she goes, oh, Bill Clinton should have been removed from office after the Monica Lewinsky affair, which, by the way, no he shouldn't have.
[03:25:35.588 --> 03:25:39.811]  So she's now basically agreeing with the impeachment.
[03:25:39.811 --> 03:25:45.194]  Right, even though she was with him all last year, raising money, cha-cha-ching.
[03:25:45.194 --> 03:25:48.597]  Well, you know, Bill Clinton was actually impeached for lying.
[03:25:49.412 --> 03:25:50.452]  He was impeached for lying.
[03:25:50.452 --> 03:25:52.373]  It wasn't the act, actually, of having sex.
[03:25:52.373 --> 03:25:53.713]  Yeah, no, it was consensual with her.
[03:25:53.713 --> 03:25:54.954]  I don't think that was an issue.
[03:25:54.954 --> 03:25:57.695]  It should be an issue with Christian voters or whatever.
[03:25:57.695 --> 03:26:01.576]  They cover up consensual sex like it's the raping or pedophilia.
[03:26:01.576 --> 03:26:02.316]  No, it's not.
[03:26:02.316 --> 03:26:08.939]  But then they don't want to talk about the actual cases like, you know, Kathleen, Willie, and... Exactly.
[03:26:08.939 --> 03:26:12.480]  So let me ask you this question, Anne Mike Cernovich.
[03:26:12.480 --> 03:26:17.822]  Why are they trying to mix normal sexual relationships in with, like, pedophilia and rape?
[03:26:17.822 --> 03:26:18.742]  It's not going to work.
[03:26:20.129 --> 03:26:24.492]  It seems like an attack on heterosexual relationships in general, an attack on the family.
[03:26:24.492 --> 03:26:25.532]  Yeah, what do you think Mike?
[03:26:25.532 --> 03:26:27.293]  I think that's what it is.
[03:26:27.293 --> 03:26:33.397]  Yeah, well I've said this before too and I know that it resounded because the Southern Poverty Law Center was really upset.
[03:26:33.397 --> 03:26:42.843]  As I said, the reason that they're attacking us is because they want to attack the nuclear family and that is why they were trying to destroy us whenever they can.
[03:26:42.843 --> 03:26:46.025]  They want the degeneracy and also what they're trying to do
[03:26:47.292 --> 03:26:49.092]  The Washington Post did this.
[03:26:49.092 --> 03:26:52.293]  Let's re-examine the Roy Moore story.
[03:26:52.293 --> 03:27:00.514]  If WaPo had only run one story where a 14-year-old girl accused Roy Moore of what he did, I think I would have believed it actually.
[03:27:00.514 --> 03:27:05.395]  But it was all package-targeted, ready, and a bunch of it's been proven to be fake.
[03:27:05.395 --> 03:27:11.877]  Yeah, and then they go, oh, and there was an 18-year-old, and then the media lumped them all in as accusers, right?
[03:27:11.877 --> 03:27:13.497]  So watch the trick the media did.
[03:27:13.497 --> 03:27:14.157]  The media goes,
[03:27:14.850 --> 03:27:17.052]  Four women have accused Roy Moore.
[03:27:17.052 --> 03:27:18.172]  Well, no they didn't.
[03:27:18.172 --> 03:27:24.757]  If an 18 year old girl says, I went on a date with a guy and we had an ice cream cone and he never did anything.
[03:27:24.757 --> 03:27:25.338]  That's not an accusation.
[03:27:25.338 --> 03:27:26.839]  That's not an accusation.
[03:27:26.839 --> 03:27:29.941]  There's nothing wrong with that, right?
[03:27:29.941 --> 03:27:33.283]  I mean, the real deal is, I think it's a little creepy, but it's not illegal.
[03:27:33.283 --> 03:27:36.345]  The guy is a stud.
[03:27:36.345 --> 03:27:39.988]  The point is, his problem is he wasn't raping him, he wasn't a pedophile, then he'd be in the club.
[03:27:41.118 --> 03:27:46.961]  Yeah, so I wasn't, you know, I wasn't defending him being 32 years old, walking around in a suit at a shopping mall.
[03:27:46.961 --> 03:27:48.462]  Yeah, I mean, I think it's creepy.
[03:27:48.462 --> 03:27:50.703]  It's like a creepy, studly guy.
[03:27:50.703 --> 03:27:52.424]  But, you know, and there could be something real.
[03:27:52.424 --> 03:27:55.606]  The point is, if something real comes out, we're going to throw him overboard.
[03:27:55.606 --> 03:27:59.247]  The Democrats are still defending, you know, MSNBC and they are defending Al Franken.
[03:27:59.247 --> 03:28:03.630]  But in some of these states, it wasn't illegal to go on a date with someone in that age group.
[03:28:03.630 --> 03:28:04.130]  Exactly.
[03:28:04.130 --> 03:28:06.931]  For me, it's creepy, but is it Harvey Weinstein?
[03:28:06.931 --> 03:28:07.292]  No.
[03:28:07.292 --> 03:28:07.872]  What do you think, Mike?
[03:28:08.638 --> 03:28:16.240]  Well, yeah, and did you notice that Gloria Allred, when she went on the news, she said she wouldn't admit that the signature was authentic.
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:17.361]  Have you guys played that footage yet?
[03:28:17.361 --> 03:28:18.261]  No, I saw that.
[03:28:18.261 --> 03:28:18.981]  I had that in the clip.
[03:28:18.981 --> 03:28:19.641]  I never got to it.
[03:28:19.641 --> 03:28:23.002]  In fact, you know, we've got that when we come back.
[03:28:23.002 --> 03:28:28.224]  Grills Allred over more accusers, and she went on to say she wouldn't say it was real.
[03:28:29.426 --> 03:28:30.446]  Yeah.
[03:28:30.446 --> 03:28:31.687]  You can see her on video.
[03:28:31.687 --> 03:28:32.407]  It's amazing.
[03:28:32.407 --> 03:28:34.507]  I can neither confirm nor deny.
[03:28:34.507 --> 03:28:35.527]  You know, lawyers speak.
[03:28:35.527 --> 03:28:37.888]  Well, Mike, we're going to be watching and gearing up for the next show.
[03:28:37.888 --> 03:28:39.668]  I know you're going to be tweeting out a lot of stuff.
[03:28:39.668 --> 03:28:40.649]  Big breaking news here.
[03:28:40.649 --> 03:28:42.009]  Great team effort.
[03:28:42.009 --> 03:28:42.909]  Everybody getting this out.
[03:28:42.909 --> 03:28:43.509]  You're taking over.
[03:28:43.509 --> 03:28:52.271]  If you want that clip, we have Katie Turr, Grills Gloria Allred over it and a lot more straight ahead on the other side with Mike Cernovich.
[03:28:52.271 --> 03:28:52.571]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:28:52.571 --> 03:28:52.831]  Stay with us.
[03:28:52.831 --> 03:28:54.852]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[03:28:54.852 --> 03:28:55.252]  That's true.
[03:28:55.859 --> 03:29:00.921]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[03:29:00.921 --> 03:29:06.123]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.

[03:30:56.352 --> 03:31:01.837]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:31:01.837 --> 03:31:02.558]  Optimum levels.
[03:31:03.610 --> 03:31:08.693]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:31:08.693 --> 03:31:10.614]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:31:10.614 --> 03:31:12.375]  B vitamins we need every day.
[03:31:12.375 --> 03:31:17.638]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:31:17.638 --> 03:31:19.259]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[03:31:19.939 --> 03:31:25.602]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:31:25.602 --> 03:31:28.604]  Secret 12, optimal absorption.
[03:31:28.604 --> 03:31:33.747]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[03:31:33.747 --> 03:31:38.950]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:39.670]  Optimum levels.
[03:31:41.031 --> 03:31:49.139]  I'm driving home here, about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving, and I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am.
[03:32:06.923 --> 03:32:17.226]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action, and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely taken over not just this country, but other nations.
[03:32:17.226 --> 03:32:31.609]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control society.
[03:32:32.606 --> 03:32:37.688]  And that we have come so far with God's help, and have turned the tide, but the enemy's tracking back.
[03:32:37.688 --> 03:32:43.551]  So just, please, we should all be so thankful to God, and thankful to each other for taking action.
[03:32:43.551 --> 03:32:48.693]  But also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead, because history is happening.
[03:32:48.693 --> 03:32:51.334]  So for myself, and my family, God bless you all.
[03:32:51.334 --> 03:32:54.055]  Have a great Thanksgiving.
[03:32:54.055 --> 03:32:56.696]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[03:33:30.895 --> 03:33:31.876]  And we're back.
[03:33:31.876 --> 03:33:32.496]  Mike Cernovich.
[03:33:32.496 --> 03:33:38.059]  Facebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich is where you can find a lot of great videos.
[03:33:38.059 --> 03:33:40.881]  Today, by the way, 40th birthday.
[03:33:40.881 --> 03:33:41.762]  Happy birthday to me.
[03:33:42.699 --> 03:33:47.863]  But even though it is my birthday and this war against the globalists, we don't get days off.
[03:33:47.863 --> 03:33:51.865]  So I'm actually going to a wonderful trip.
[03:33:51.865 --> 03:33:54.307]  I'm going to leave right after this actually.
[03:33:54.307 --> 03:33:55.908]  Take a great trip.
[03:33:55.908 --> 03:33:57.009]  Have a nice weekend away.
[03:33:57.009 --> 03:34:01.512]  But you all are too important for me to not be with today because
[03:34:02.279 --> 03:34:08.462]  I'm not always able to talk with you on Fridays because I just wrapped up production on a big film.
[03:34:08.462 --> 03:34:09.782]  Everybody's so busy.
[03:34:09.782 --> 03:34:16.285]  That's the thing is we do live in a golden era of media and journalism.
[03:34:16.285 --> 03:34:22.969]  I right now am sitting on a bombshell story that will rock the halls of Congress that I'm working on.
[03:34:22.969 --> 03:34:24.729]  I'm here talking with all of you.
[03:34:24.729 --> 03:34:27.771]  We're building a big film that I was doing.
[03:34:27.771 --> 03:34:29.431]  That's in post-production.
[03:34:29.431 --> 03:34:30.332]  Alex is building
[03:34:31.081 --> 03:34:32.862]  The studio's out.
[03:34:32.862 --> 03:34:43.245]  And this is why the support from all of you is so important and why the product specials matter so much because there are no outside advertisers for Alex.
[03:34:43.245 --> 03:34:46.585]  There's no outside advertisers for me.
[03:34:46.585 --> 03:34:48.946]  This is all 100% listener funded.
[03:34:48.946 --> 03:34:50.006]  A lot of people don't get it.
[03:34:50.006 --> 03:34:52.627]  I hear from people in right-wing media all the time.
[03:34:52.627 --> 03:34:54.728]  You know, Mike, I can't make any money doing this.
[03:34:54.728 --> 03:34:56.668]  Mike, you know this, Mike that.
[03:34:56.668 --> 03:34:58.469]  Because Toyota Corolla
[03:34:59.640 --> 03:35:03.781]  Isn't going to advertise with right wing media with the media that tells the truth.
[03:35:03.781 --> 03:35:05.802]  You're not going to get Mercedes-Benz.
[03:35:05.802 --> 03:35:09.943]  You're not going to get BMW, Keurig, the coffee maker.
[03:35:09.943 --> 03:35:13.385]  They even pulled out some Hannity, right?
[03:35:13.385 --> 03:35:16.065]  Hot dog companies pulled their ass from Hannity.
[03:35:16.065 --> 03:35:17.046]  You name it.
[03:35:17.046 --> 03:35:20.767]  So that's why the support of the listeners are important, but it's a two way commitment.
[03:35:21.565 --> 03:35:22.206]  Right.
[03:35:22.206 --> 03:35:28.310]  That's why I'm here on a Friday on my birthday with you, because your support matters.
[03:35:28.310 --> 03:35:38.597]  And I thank you for the support that you've given me, the support that you've given the whole InfoWars crew, because there are a lot of people who are very grateful for all the support you are giving.
[03:35:38.597 --> 03:35:41.299]  And you give that every time you order and you get stuff on auto ship.
[03:35:41.903 --> 03:35:46.365]  And you buy the products while they're on special, subscribe and save.
[03:35:46.365 --> 03:35:51.407]  Caveman True Paleo Formula, that's the product that I always plug because that's the one I personally use.
[03:35:51.407 --> 03:35:54.229]  With me, I just don't plug anything, right?
[03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:57.130]  I just don't, because I don't plug anything that I don't take.
[03:35:57.130 --> 03:35:59.591]  But I know the Caveman stuff is amazing.
[03:35:59.591 --> 03:36:00.992]  It's collagen.
[03:36:00.992 --> 03:36:03.873]  I've done smoothie recipes before with frozen berries.
[03:36:04.642 --> 03:36:08.425]  Smoothie recipes with a banana, almond milk.
[03:36:08.425 --> 03:36:22.574]  You throw in some Caveman True Paleo strawberry formula with some frozen blueberries and a banana and you have all the nutrition you need for your joints and other parts of your body and that's the one that I think is the best.
[03:36:22.574 --> 03:36:27.417]  And so thank you again for your support and let's get back to, well that is fun by the way.
[03:36:27.417 --> 03:36:32.040]  You know I'm actually publishing an article today, 40 Life Lessons When I Turn 40.
[03:36:33.149 --> 03:36:35.351]  Which is kind of like cliche, but it's kind of cool.
[03:36:35.351 --> 03:36:37.052]  Those things tend to go viral.
[03:36:37.052 --> 03:36:40.614]  And we do want our message of positivity to go viral.
[03:36:40.614 --> 03:36:46.298]  I really don't like that people don't realize how positive and upbeat and fun Alex is.
[03:36:46.298 --> 03:36:48.720]  You see a side of that on the show.
[03:36:48.720 --> 03:36:51.322]  But, you know, what we're doing is warfare every day.
[03:36:51.322 --> 03:36:52.723]  Warfare against the globalists.
[03:36:52.723 --> 03:36:55.685]  Warfare against the pedophile Hollywood establishment.
[03:36:56.394 --> 03:37:02.539]  Very important to remember, though, to spend time with your family, to reflect, to be good to one another.
[03:37:02.539 --> 03:37:09.764]  That's ultimately the message from me, the message from the whole Infowars team is we want to make the world better.
[03:37:09.764 --> 03:37:15.929]  The fake news media, they have to lie about us, actually, to make us look bad, because all we want to do is make the world a better place.
[03:37:15.929 --> 03:37:19.772]  We want you to be healthier, wealthier, wiser, and every day.
[03:37:19.772 --> 03:37:24.916]  And that's why we share real news, where I got to give credit to NBC.
[03:37:24.916 --> 03:37:26.017]  I never thought I would say this.
[03:37:27.239 --> 03:37:30.803]  But NBC did some real journalism.
[03:37:30.803 --> 03:37:35.888]  This video you're about to watch, I couldn't believe I watched this on NBC.
[03:37:35.888 --> 03:37:37.670]  I'll be completely honest with you.
[03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:47.761]  This video you're about to watch, a journalist named Katie Turrer actually does real journalism and confronts Gloria Allred about potential forgery accusations.
[03:37:48.621 --> 03:37:54.727]  So I want you, if you're at home listening, very attentively, and if you're watching, to watch attentively.
[03:37:54.727 --> 03:37:58.511]  Let's play that clip and then let's analyze it once it's over.
[03:37:58.511 --> 03:38:07.680]  At this point, I have no reason to believe that what he wrote in the yearbook is anything but his signature.
[03:38:07.680 --> 03:38:10.443]  Does your client, Beverly Young Nelson, remember him signing it?
[03:38:14.355 --> 03:38:18.157]  She remembers his, well, she remembers being with him.
[03:38:18.157 --> 03:38:21.059]  It was on the counter.
[03:38:21.059 --> 03:38:33.447]  She alleges that he took it, that he signed it, and she was thrilled that he had signed it because, as far as she knew, he was a DA and that was an important position.
[03:38:33.447 --> 03:38:34.527]  So she saw him sign it?
[03:38:34.527 --> 03:38:42.072]  I don't think at the time she had a clue whether he was an assistant DA or a DA, but he signed it, she took it,
[03:38:43.176 --> 03:38:48.280]  As far as she knows, I mean, there's no reason for her to think it's anything but his signature.
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:52.583]  But did she see him sign it?
[03:38:52.583 --> 03:38:58.887]  You know, I don't... I haven't asked her if she saw him, but we did describe what happened that...
[03:38:59.825 --> 03:39:04.708]  I asked this because it seems like you're not 100% sure that it is his signature.
[03:39:04.708 --> 03:39:09.191]  And if you're not 100% sure that it is his signature, why would you show it at a press conference?
[03:39:23.388 --> 03:39:26.733]  Well, why would, you know, why does anybody doubt that it is his signature?
[03:39:26.733 --> 03:39:30.738]  Well, Roy Moore's campaign is saying, and Roy Moore himself is saying it's not his signature.
[03:39:32.919 --> 03:39:39.324]  Well, he has a motive to say that and let him prove that it's not.
[03:39:39.324 --> 03:39:52.475]  We have offered to provide it to an independent expert at the hearing which would be held in Washington and we have allowed it to be examined.
[03:39:52.475 --> 03:39:55.197]  Have you gotten any response from anybody in Congress?
[03:39:55.197 --> 03:39:57.239]  I have no reason.
[03:39:57.239 --> 03:39:59.481]  They have not provided me any evidence.
[03:40:00.041 --> 03:40:02.343]  To suggest that it is not his signature.
[03:40:02.343 --> 03:40:08.207]  All they've done is make this bold assertion that it's not.
[03:40:08.207 --> 03:40:15.312]  But they have not provided any evidence whatsoever to support their assertion.
[03:40:15.312 --> 03:40:18.435]  Of course they have a motive to make that assertion.
[03:40:18.435 --> 03:40:21.417]  Because he is denying, first he denied even knowing her.
[03:40:22.097 --> 03:40:41.311]  Then he, uh, he compounded that, uh, or confused that whole issue by saying something to the effect that, oh, well, she appeared before him in a divorce case, and, uh, apparently that does not appear to be accurate either.
[03:40:41.311 --> 03:40:42.832]  Wow.
[03:40:42.832 --> 03:40:45.374]  I would, I, I'm telling people if you want to
[03:40:46.329 --> 03:40:49.853]  Witness a master class in deception.
[03:40:49.853 --> 03:40:51.895]  How to spot a liar.
[03:40:51.895 --> 03:40:56.659]  Just watch that video with the sound on and then the sound off.
[03:40:56.659 --> 03:40:58.541]  Can you say KD Tour?
[03:40:58.541 --> 03:41:00.783]  By the way, all credit to KD Tour.
[03:41:00.783 --> 03:41:05.648]  I don't do this very often, but I always believe that we should give credit because that's integrity.
[03:41:06.463 --> 03:41:11.224]  I always believe that as hard as I am on the fake news, I don't have a problem with real journalism.
[03:41:11.224 --> 03:41:15.645]  I have a problem with fake news and I tip my hat to Katie Tor there.
[03:41:15.645 --> 03:41:18.925]  That was a master class in exposing a liar.
[03:41:18.925 --> 03:41:21.946]  Gloria Allred would not defend her client.
[03:41:21.946 --> 03:41:23.746]  So I don't know what to say.
[03:41:23.746 --> 03:41:30.067]  I'll tell you this 100% confession, my confession time, a story I got wrong.
[03:41:30.067 --> 03:41:33.748]  When people told me that that yearbook signature was fake,
[03:41:34.366 --> 03:41:39.527]  I'm going to tell you right away that I told people, guys, that sounds like a conspiracy theory.
[03:41:39.527 --> 03:41:40.727]  I don't believe it.
[03:41:40.727 --> 03:41:41.687]  Leave me alone.
[03:41:41.687 --> 03:41:49.469]  The idea, maybe I'm just naive, the idea that they would go to that length to forge a signature like this, right?
[03:41:49.469 --> 03:41:54.010]  So you can read my tweets where I told people that I believe the yearbook was authentic.
[03:41:54.010 --> 03:41:58.531]  I told people that I thought it was a conspiracy theory to doubt it.
[03:41:58.531 --> 03:42:00.371]  And now I'm the one who looks like the fool.
[03:42:01.269 --> 03:42:04.491]  But you gotta own your mistakes in life, and I own that mistake.
[03:42:04.491 --> 03:42:12.695]  I accused a lot of people of spreading conspiracy theory about a Ford signature, but Gloria Allred right there confirmed the conspiracy theory.
[03:42:12.695 --> 03:42:15.056]  She's the one who won't stand by her client.
[03:42:15.056 --> 03:42:16.797]  This is her client.
[03:42:16.797 --> 03:42:19.079]  She doesn't trust her own client.
[03:42:19.079 --> 03:42:21.280]  She doesn't believe it's true.
[03:42:21.280 --> 03:42:22.981]  She's hedging her bet.
[03:42:22.981 --> 03:42:30.605]  So Gloria Allred is now the person who has cast that entire signature into doubt, and that really goes to show the real problem of fake news.
[03:42:31.351 --> 03:42:33.072]  They had me conned.
[03:42:33.072 --> 03:42:34.993]  And I spot fake news for a living.
[03:42:34.993 --> 03:42:38.074]  I'm doing a documentary on fake news called Hoax.
[03:42:38.074 --> 03:42:47.619]  Even with my great ability to spot media hoaxes, even I, Mike Cernovich, fell victim to the con of the fake news media and that forgery.
[03:42:47.619 --> 03:42:51.041]  So that goes to show I don't know how much can you trust on the news.
[03:42:51.041 --> 03:42:52.221]  Probably none of it.
[03:42:52.221 --> 03:42:53.482]  But you can trust InfoWars.com.
[03:42:53.482 --> 03:42:59.245]  I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding our operation by purchasing products,
[03:43:02.426 --> 03:43:04.488]  We don't have corporate sponsors.
[03:43:04.488 --> 03:43:05.950]  We don't have globalist funding.
[03:43:05.950 --> 03:43:07.693]  We're funded by patriots like you.
[03:43:08.968 --> 03:43:22.674]  We provide high quality products to make it easy to support yourself and to support us symbiotically as we try to retake this country and the planet and heal the population that's put under globalist engineering.
[03:43:22.674 --> 03:43:30.517]  That said, we're running biggest specials ever every single year during Black Friday and this year is even better than last year.
[03:43:30.517 --> 03:43:33.499]  We've got free shipping storewide on everything.

[03:43:45.225 --> 03:43:46.746]  That's unprecedented.

[03:43:50.190 --> 03:43:51.071]  So check it out today.
[03:43:52.655 --> 03:43:55.800]  America is an information-based civil war.
[03:43:55.800 --> 03:44:03.230]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[03:44:03.230 --> 03:44:08.757]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:44:09.598 --> 03:44:17.282]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[03:44:17.282 --> 03:44:25.867]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[03:44:25.867 --> 03:44:30.930]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[03:44:30.930 --> 03:44:32.351]  They are the anti-liberals.
[03:44:33.067 --> 03:44:37.430]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide.
[03:44:37.430 --> 03:44:46.455]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:44:52.637 --> 03:45:03.027]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of a giant time bomb.
[03:45:03.027 --> 03:45:11.155]  With populations and globalism and the New World Order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy.
[03:45:11.155 --> 03:45:13.097]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[03:45:13.746 --> 03:45:16.467]  We've also got to have rear-guard actions to be prepared.
[03:45:16.467 --> 03:45:21.028]  The number one thing, after getting right with God, is to have high-quality, storable food.
[03:45:21.028 --> 03:45:27.070]  Well, the entire line of My Patriot Supply Foods, private-labeled as MFOR Select, is now 50% off.
[03:45:27.070 --> 03:45:30.391]  We've only done that one time before previously.

[03:45:31.071 --> 03:45:32.312]  You cannot beat that.
[03:45:33.373 --> 03:45:35.995]  And we're only doing that through Cyber Monday.
[03:45:35.995 --> 03:45:39.800]  So it starts today on Thanksgiving and runs through next Monday.
[03:45:39.800 --> 03:45:41.642]  Infowarsstore.com.

[03:45:45.986 --> 03:45:46.907]  Totally fresh.
[03:45:46.907 --> 03:45:47.708]  Last 25 years.

[03:46:54.556 --> 03:46:57.157]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:10.823 --> 03:47:13.465]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:13.465 --> 03:47:15.708]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.708 --> 03:47:21.754]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:47:21.754 --> 03:47:23.816]  And we're back with the final segment, Mike Cernovich.
[03:47:23.816 --> 03:47:27.780]  You can find me at facebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich.
[03:47:27.780 --> 03:47:32.505]  Here to talk about, and we'll call this segment, how Congress covers up
[03:47:33.456 --> 03:47:38.820]  Sexual misconduct, sexual harassment and sexual assault by its members.
[03:47:38.820 --> 03:47:45.144]  This is very, very disturbing stuff that I'm about to break a bigger story on probably Monday.
[03:47:45.144 --> 03:47:45.845]  We'll see.
[03:47:45.845 --> 03:47:47.406]  It's a very big story.
[03:47:47.406 --> 03:47:49.447]  Everybody in Congress is going to feel it.
[03:47:49.447 --> 03:47:51.508]  It'll be on the level of the Susan Rice story.
[03:47:51.508 --> 03:47:53.310]  So stay tuned for that.
[03:47:53.310 --> 03:48:02.476]  But what I've been learning is that if we click on to read Wilson had a tweet where the Congressional Office of Compliance releases a year by year breakdown
[03:48:03.732 --> 03:48:05.453]  of harassment claims and settlements.
[03:48:05.453 --> 03:48:15.277]  So we're going to take a look at this chart and for those of you just listening in, excuse me, for those of you listening in, we'll just read it to you and those of you at home can watch.
[03:48:15.277 --> 03:48:24.640]  There is a star chamber designed to completely silence victims of sexual misconduct by congressmen.
[03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:28.021]  So it's called the Congressional Office of Compliance.
[03:48:28.021 --> 03:48:29.182]  Now under federal law,
[03:48:29.958 --> 03:48:37.564]  Under federal law, any complaint a staffer makes against a congressman or congresswoman, it has to be kept confidential.
[03:48:37.564 --> 03:48:49.613]  It goes to this very quiet little star chamber where you don't have any due process of law, government attorneys bully you, berate you, they do anything they can to keep quiet.
[03:48:49.613 --> 03:48:58.199]  And then if they settle the lawsuit with you, under law, under federal law, it would be a violation of federal law for you to go public with this.
[03:48:59.494 --> 03:49:01.035]  So what are they hiding?
[03:49:01.035 --> 03:49:13.667]  Well, we're about to reveal a lot of this because when I found this chart where they talked about the number of settlements every year, there was one year I believe there was something like $4 million in settlements.
[03:49:13.667 --> 03:49:17.891]  I can see if I can pull the chart up real quick because the numbers are startling.
[03:49:17.891 --> 03:49:20.493]  In 2007, 25 sexual misconduct cases were settled, $4 million.
[03:49:25.083 --> 03:49:29.225]  In 2002, 10 were settled for $3.9 million.
[03:49:29.225 --> 03:49:37.108]  And then in other years, you have $400,000, $800,000, $806,000.
[03:49:37.108 --> 03:49:38.008]  Big numbers.
[03:49:38.008 --> 03:49:42.130]  Now, we, the taxpayers, are paying this.
[03:49:42.130 --> 03:49:44.111]  This should be a way bigger story.
[03:49:44.111 --> 03:49:49.173]  As bad as Al Franken's video was, maybe some people could say, well, it was a joke.
[03:49:49.173 --> 03:49:50.213]  Do I agree with that?
[03:49:50.213 --> 03:49:54.055]  Look, you know, I've said a few things trolling that I shouldn't have said.
[03:49:55.299 --> 03:49:59.621]  I'm not going to cast a lot of stones, but this is not a joke.
[03:49:59.621 --> 03:50:09.464]  This is taxpayer money being paid out for the misconduct of members of Congress, many of whom are multi-millionaires.
[03:50:09.464 --> 03:50:20.127]  They're using taxpayer money to seduce women, and then when the women complain, or when they're not being seduced, when they're actually being harassed, our money
[03:50:20.999 --> 03:50:24.220]  Is paying them to go away and it's all silent.
[03:50:24.220 --> 03:50:25.961]  So we have to get this out there.
[03:50:25.961 --> 03:50:30.343]  So what I've done is, and it's my pin tweet right now.
[03:50:30.343 --> 03:50:35.725]  I'm offering a cash reward for a list of these settlements.
[03:50:35.725 --> 03:50:37.165]  So I have said that I will give $10,000.
[03:50:37.165 --> 03:50:45.548]  I would give $10,000 cash, Bitcoin, check, whatever people want to do.
[03:50:45.548 --> 03:50:47.189]  I want to know.
[03:50:48.064 --> 03:50:49.405]  About these settlements.
[03:50:49.405 --> 03:50:56.691]  The fake news media, by the way, has always known about this Office of Compliance in these secret star chambers.
[03:50:56.691 --> 03:51:01.414]  But most of these people who are engaging misconduct, as we're now learning, are Democrats.
[03:51:01.414 --> 03:51:12.042]  So the media, rather than doing their job and finding out who is doing this, they're covering up for Democrats yet again.
[03:51:12.042 --> 03:51:16.686]  But they can't cover up for Democrats anymore because now they want to come after Roy Moore.
[03:51:17.708 --> 03:51:19.568]  Now suddenly they care.
[03:51:19.568 --> 03:51:21.349]  Oh, Roy Moore, they got to go after Roy Moore.
[03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:25.750]  Well, where were they when Anthony Weiner was sexting underage girls?
[03:51:25.750 --> 03:51:27.650]  Which, by the way, was caught on camera.
[03:51:27.650 --> 03:51:34.311]  Anthony Weiner is going to prison because he was caught on camera seducing a 15-year-old.
[03:51:34.311 --> 03:51:39.112]  The media reported that he was, you know, in a lot of trouble.
[03:51:39.112 --> 03:51:43.553]  But they didn't report that he was married to Uma.
[03:51:43.553 --> 03:51:47.374]  He had access to classified emails, classified information.
[03:51:48.388 --> 03:51:51.891]  This man, this sexual predator, was almost in the White House.
[03:51:51.891 --> 03:51:55.273]  He was a great friend of Chuck Schumer.
[03:51:55.273 --> 03:52:02.038]  You notice that the media never called Democrats and said, hey, Chuck Schumer, do you disavow Anthony Weiner?
[03:52:02.038 --> 03:52:06.741]  They said, oh, well, we'll report on the charges against him, but we're not going to hold Democrats accountable.
[03:52:06.741 --> 03:52:10.543]  You can't hold... Here's how the media plays it.
[03:52:10.543 --> 03:52:14.086]  Mike, you can't expect us to blame every Democrat.
[03:52:15.020 --> 03:52:17.682]  For something another Democrat does?
[03:52:17.682 --> 03:52:20.564]  Even when he was part of the Clinton's inner circle?
[03:52:20.564 --> 03:52:24.186]  Even when Bill Clinton officiated Wieners and Uma's wedding?
[03:52:24.186 --> 03:52:25.267]  Mike, you can't do that.
[03:52:25.267 --> 03:52:28.289]  That's an unfair standard to do.
[03:52:28.289 --> 03:52:29.690]  So we're not going to do it.
[03:52:29.690 --> 03:52:39.817]  But then suddenly, when Roy Moore is accused, in some cases of merely going on a date for ice cream with an 18-year-old, that's an accusation.
[03:52:39.817 --> 03:52:40.818]  If you're a Republican,
[03:52:41.716 --> 03:52:47.721]  Going on a date and eating an ice cream cone with an 18-year-old, that constitutes an accusation, right?
[03:52:47.721 --> 03:52:57.149]  But if you're 15 years old and you're, you know, sexually assaulting young girls, 15-year-olds, and it's on camera, well, you know, that isn't the fault of Democrats.
[03:52:57.149 --> 03:53:06.517]  Well, with Roy Moore, within 44 minutes, our media had called every Republican in the Senate and demanded a statement.
[03:53:07.364 --> 03:53:11.386]  And asked him to disavow Roy Moore, who, by the way, is not in the Senate.
[03:53:11.386 --> 03:53:13.827]  Let's be quite clear about this.
[03:53:13.827 --> 03:53:16.688]  Roy Moore is not in the Senate.
[03:53:16.688 --> 03:53:28.112]  So isn't it interesting how when it's a Republican accused of something, even if it's just merely going and having an ice cream cone with an 18 year old, the media is all over it.
[03:53:28.112 --> 03:53:29.493]  They're calling every Republican.
[03:53:29.493 --> 03:53:30.773]  You better do something about it.
[03:53:30.773 --> 03:53:32.654]  You better say something about it.
[03:53:32.654 --> 03:53:36.976]  But when it's a Democrat caught on camera doing something bad,
[03:53:37.665 --> 03:53:40.367]  The media goes, oh come on guys, you're being unreasonable.
[03:53:40.367 --> 03:53:47.492]  You can't expect every Democrat to take personal responsibility for what one bad apple did, right?
[03:53:47.492 --> 03:53:48.612]  It's always a bad apple.
[03:53:48.612 --> 03:53:49.773]  Oh, it's just a bad apple.
[03:53:49.773 --> 03:53:56.818]  Even though over and over it's been shown that Democrats are actually the real rapists.
[03:53:56.818 --> 03:53:59.160]  Democrats are the real rapists.
[03:53:59.160 --> 03:54:04.083]  So yeah, 25 senators disavowed Roy Moore within like a matter of minutes because every
[03:54:05.313 --> 03:54:07.914]  Reporter was on the phone calling them.
[03:54:07.914 --> 03:54:12.597]  Well, how many report how many senators have disavowed Al Franken?
[03:54:12.597 --> 03:54:14.758]  Where's that story?
[03:54:14.758 --> 03:54:23.103]  Right, that that's what the media and that's why they hate us and they want to get us all banned and everything because if it weren't for us, they wouldn't have even reported on Al Franken.
[03:54:23.103 --> 03:54:25.904]  I called the media people out.
[03:54:25.904 --> 03:54:29.966]  It was noon Eastern Standard Time.
[03:54:29.966 --> 03:54:31.247]  Before Chris L Hayes.
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:35.761]  Dave Weigel of the Washington Post, Matty Iglesias of Vox.
[03:54:35.761 --> 03:54:40.662]  You name a high-level Democrat, they waited hours.
[03:54:40.662 --> 03:54:48.924]  And I call them high-level Democrats because if you do work in the mainstream media, for the Washington Post or CNN, that's what you are, you're a high-level Democrat.
[03:54:48.924 --> 03:54:49.804]  It took them hours.
[03:54:49.804 --> 03:54:57.826]  And then I'm on social media going through their timelines, screencapping and saying, look, we haven't heard anything from these high-level Democrat operatives in the media.
[03:54:58.692 --> 03:55:03.455]  And then suddenly they realized, oh, we're getting caught.
[03:55:03.455 --> 03:55:10.358]  Well, we got to ban Cernovich one of these days, but until we have him banned, because I'm like the Socrates of Twitter, right?
[03:55:10.358 --> 03:55:11.759]  I'm the gadfly.
[03:55:11.759 --> 03:55:23.706]  I'm the guy saying, well, wait a minute, Chris Alhaze, you were just saying that every Republican has to disavow Roy Moore, but now you're not even talking about Al Franken, who was caught on camera.
[03:55:23.706 --> 03:55:24.406]  What about that?
[03:55:24.406 --> 03:55:27.488]  So using the Socratic method, because I am the Socrates of Twitter,
[03:55:28.698 --> 03:55:34.160]  They hate me and they do want to give me the hemlock and virtual hemlock.
[03:55:34.160 --> 03:55:45.943]  They want me removed from the internet virtually and I do sincerely believe based on reasonable information that they do want me killed with literal hemlock if they had the power and could get away with it.
[03:55:45.943 --> 03:55:48.684]  But luckily there are people watching out for us.
[03:55:48.684 --> 03:55:57.066]  And indeed WAPO even ran a column by Kate Harding who says, I'm a feminist but we should keep Al Franken in office.
[03:55:57.848 --> 03:56:09.215]  So this is an amazing column, I encourage everybody to read it, where she goes, I'm a feminist, I study rape culture, and I don't want Al Franken to resign.
[03:56:09.215 --> 03:56:11.536]  The mask has slipped off.
[03:56:11.536 --> 03:56:15.679]  She admits it doesn't matter what you do.
[03:56:15.679 --> 03:56:18.200]  You can be a rapist if you're a Democrat.
[03:56:18.200 --> 03:56:24.124]  If you're a Democrat and you're caught on camera molesting a woman, they'll even call it a virtual grope.
[03:56:24.887 --> 03:56:34.832]  This was a great line from NBC because we praised Katie Tour on NBC for actually asking Gloria Allred real questions.
[03:56:34.832 --> 03:56:42.296]  Another commentator on NBC had said, well, Al Franken didn't grope her.
[03:56:42.296 --> 03:56:44.077]  It was a mock groping.
[03:56:44.077 --> 03:56:47.358]  Boy, they really want to look at camera angles when it's a Democrat, right?
[03:56:47.358 --> 03:56:48.759]  So even when you give them
[03:56:49.640 --> 03:56:56.441]  Even when you give them a picture, they're like, well, you know, were his fingers technically touching her?
[03:56:56.441 --> 03:56:57.682]  Was it merely hovering?
[03:56:57.682 --> 03:57:03.603]  NBC Pundit said, not actually groping is mock groping.
[03:57:03.603 --> 03:57:04.523]  Right.
[03:57:04.523 --> 03:57:05.903]  Amazing.
[03:57:05.903 --> 03:57:10.124]  The level of mental gymnastics they'll go through to protect their own.
[03:57:10.124 --> 03:57:16.005]  So that's why I'm grateful that Kate Harding in the Washington Post said, oh, we know he groped her, but who cares?
[03:57:16.005 --> 03:57:18.526]  He's one of us and we will protect our own.
[03:57:19.272 --> 03:57:25.676]  So keep that in mind when they call you, the great listeners, when they call you a conspiracy theorist.
[03:57:25.676 --> 03:57:32.721]  The conspiracy is now out in the open, where they admit that they conspire to cover up for their own side.
[03:57:32.721 --> 03:57:34.582]  Great hour, thanks everybody.
