[00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.584]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:23.325]  It is Monday, May 1st, 2017.
[00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:25.506]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:32.389]  It's the biggest May Day in recent memory.
[00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.290]  Why?
[00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.474]  Another opportunity to protest President Trump, as anti-Trump non-citizens attempt to plan the biggest worker strike in decades.
[00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:47.438]  Also, mainstream media is trying to pass the old lie that there is no Deep State.
[00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.340]  Any notion of such is a loony conspiracy.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.901]  But the American people don't agree.
[00:00:53.956 --> 00:01:01.002]  Meanwhile, a former Navy SEAL is working to shine a light on and bring down pedophilia amongst the elite.
[00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:03.004]  But it hasn't been a smooth ride.
[00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:11.691]  We're gonna shoot this documentary and go and rip the lid off and shine the light, the sign of sunlight on this cesspool of corruption and help clean it up.
[00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:16.715]  We've got a president now that is not okay with children being raped and tortured to death.
[00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:20.258]  All that and more tonight on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:36.730]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.470]  I take this.
[00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.771]  My family takes this.
[00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:43.115]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:47.619]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.320]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.440]  I don't feel good.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.041]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.922]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:05.304]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:08.184]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:12.145]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.446]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:14.866]  I love it.
[00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:17.629]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.810]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:24.778]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:24.798 --> 00:02:26.420]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.882]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:12.730]  Well, it's May Day, that day that we all set aside to celebrate the violence, the theft, the mass murder, the starvation, the tyranny of communism.
[00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.032]  We celebrate that on May Day.
[00:03:15.332 --> 00:03:25.780]  And of course, immigration, because the immigrants are being used by the communists, by the progressives, to try to bring chaos, conflict, war to our economy, to take down our economy.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.306]  But let's take a look at the long history here briefly and how it applies to Venezuela and to our Supreme Court.
[00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:43.657]  That is now defended Venezuela against a company that is trying to sue them in court to get back the business that they confiscated from them in Venezuela.
[00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.018]  Of course, we have this article from the UK Telegraph.
[00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:53.384]  They say, Venezuela is collapsing into a socialist-induced chaos, yet it remains a Corbynista poster child.
[00:03:53.404 --> 00:03:58.948]  And of course, he's talking about Jeremy Corbyn, the head of the UK Socialist Party, but it equally applies to
[00:03:59.628 --> 00:04:04.030]  Bernie Sanders, who I've always talked about as being Bernie Sandernista.
[00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.051]  Because it's not just the Corbinistas, but it's the Sandernistas.
[00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:10.572]  It was Bernie Sanders who just loved the Nicaraguan Sandernistas.
[00:04:11.172 --> 00:04:24.838]  And he has not walked back any of those comments from 30 some odd years ago, when he went down to Sandernista and applauded the people who later became the same kind of thieves and kleptocrats that we see operating now in Venezuela.
[00:04:25.518 --> 00:04:37.411]  But as he pointed out in this article here, he said, we've seen the moral bankruptcy of socialism, but he said, let's think about the whole history of this last 100 years, because it was in 1917 that we had the Russian Revolution.
[00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:44.983]  He said it was followed then by the Russian Famine of 1921-22, a direct result of Lenin's collectivist policies.
[00:04:45.323 --> 00:04:46.704]  That led to about 5 million deaths.
[00:04:47.124 --> 00:04:56.769]  Between 1958 and 1962, we had Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward in China, a socialist project to industrialize the country that resulted in about 45 million killed.
[00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.831]  And of course, these estimates are difficult to get.
[00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:02.813]  These are probably conservative estimates if you take a look at what happened.
[00:05:02.993 --> 00:05:03.693]  In the late 1970s, under Pol Pot,
[00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:13.938]  We had two million who perished in Cambodia in a collectivist attempt to organize that country, the tyranny, the despotism that was created by that.
[00:05:13.978 --> 00:05:18.641]  We have Lenin, we have Mao, we have Pol Pot, and we have Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.
[00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:22.443]  And then, of course, in the UK they have their own Jeremy Corbyn here.
[00:05:23.163 --> 00:05:28.367]  In America, we have Bernie Sanders, who is now becoming the heart and soul of the Democrat Party.
[00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:32.451]  CNN looks at it and says, Venezuela, how paradise got lost?
[00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:33.612]  I mean, this is socialism.
[00:05:33.672 --> 00:05:34.673]  This should be paradise.
[00:05:34.713 --> 00:05:35.634]  It should be utopia.
[00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:45.622]  And when we look at what's happening there, the wage and price controls, children dying in the hospital, plummeting oil prices, and the place that has the world's largest oil reserves.
[00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:46.943]  How can this be?
[00:05:47.063 --> 00:05:48.604]  Well, it's the economic system.
[00:05:48.885 --> 00:05:51.007]  It gets reproduced everywhere they go.
[00:05:51.027 --> 00:05:56.972]  And one of the things I thought was interesting, CNN, they say the Maduro diet, rampant inflation, means more people are skipping meals.
[00:05:57.072 --> 00:06:01.075]  No, actually, that's the understatement of the year, okay?
[00:06:01.115 --> 00:06:04.098]  You got people having to cross the border to try to get food.
[00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:06.720]  They're hunting police down in the streets for their weapons.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.522]  Then they're hunting dogs and cats in order to eat.
[00:06:09.562 --> 00:06:10.864]  They are storming stores.
[00:06:11.524 --> 00:06:11.944]  Oh, it's a
[00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:13.426]  A little bit of a diet.
[00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:16.291]  That's like calling massive confiscation a haircut.
[00:06:16.872 --> 00:06:18.856]  And so we see protests are building there.
[00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.358]  And yet, what is happening here in America?
[00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.323]  Today we had the US Supreme Court side with Venezuela.
[00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:25.006]  There was an oil company, a drilling company.
[00:06:26.024 --> 00:06:26.404]  We're good.
[00:06:46.244 --> 00:06:48.526]  Foreign governments can be sued in the U.S.
[00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:58.536]  when their private property is seized, but the Supreme Court ruled 8-0 that the lower court had not made a good case that this could go through.
[00:06:58.997 --> 00:07:02.840]  So the company's stock has declined as part of that.
[00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:08.366]  Now clearly I think this is something where it should be going forward once it goes back to the lower court.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:18.885]  But when you look at what is going on and you understand, as we pointed out earlier today, that the way that Obamacare is funded, which is socialism in our country, is by confiscation.
[00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:21.086]  They always devolve into kleptocracy.
[00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:28.811]  And just as you cannot get health care in Venezuela, you will not be able to get health care in America if we go down that road.
[00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:30.772]  And how are we funding Obamacare?
[00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:42.219]  As Jerome Corsi has pointed out time and time and again, we are stealing the money just the same as Venezuela taking over the oil rigs, just the same as Venezuela just this last week, confiscating a General Motors auto plant.
[00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:43.300]  What are we doing in America?
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:49.604]  We are confiscating the investment money of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors.
[00:07:49.965 --> 00:07:52.066]  We are doing a net worth sweep.
[00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:52.686]  Isn't that nice?
[00:07:52.726 --> 00:07:54.708]  They don't call it theft, they call it a net worth sweep.
[00:07:55.048 --> 00:07:56.949]  That's how they fund Obamacare.
[00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:58.450]  It's pure socialism.
[00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.791]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:08:05.815 --> 00:08:15.623]  Well, it is May Day, which means we are seeing leftist groups across the nation taking to the streets to march in perpetual protest of President Trump and his policies.
[00:08:16.303 --> 00:08:21.527]  Of course, we've got anti-Trump illegal aliens vowing the biggest worker strike in over a decade.
[00:08:21.547 --> 00:08:25.290]  The International Workers' Day protesters
[00:08:26.286 --> 00:08:36.754]  Say that they are protesting what they're calling the federal government's deportation machinery and they're demanding civil rights reserved for citizens to be bestowed upon illegal immigrants.
[00:08:37.175 --> 00:08:43.239]  So these May Day protests go back, the protests by the illegal aliens go back to about 2006.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.924]  1.5 million people then took to the streets across the country demanding immigration reform.
[00:08:49.324 --> 00:08:52.528]  But now, immigration reform, that is not even on the table.
[00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:54.791]  They're not even asking for immigration reform.
[00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:57.615]  They're not even asking for a pathway to citizenship.
[00:08:57.975 --> 00:09:02.922]  What they are now demanding is that the rights, civil rights that are reserved for U.S.
[00:09:02.962 --> 00:09:04.704]  citizens, be bestowed upon them as well.
[00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:14.447]  An article covering it says, the policy agenda is no longer about winning citizenship or even legal status for the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants.
[00:09:14.927 --> 00:09:17.048]  It's about defending families from separation.
[00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:25.190]  And immigrants and their allies are now defending civil rights like due process and values like democracy and inclusiveness.
[00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.250]  That's what they are demanding now.
[00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.671]  To just go ahead and be recognized.
[00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.391]  Fine, we don't need to be citizens, but we want all the rights.
[00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:32.972]  And so that's very interesting.
[00:09:34.112 --> 00:09:38.336]  That we are seeing President Trump working with Congress.
[00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:42.599]  They're reaching this budget deal to keep the government open until September.
[00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:45.922]  But there's nothing there in the budget for the border wall.
[00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:49.505]  But these sanctuary cities are receiving their funding.
[00:09:50.265 --> 00:09:54.249]  So I don't really know what a lot of these perpetual protests are about.
[00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:58.052]  They seem to keep on winning when the pen gets to paper.
[00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:00.293]  So nothing for the border wall.
[00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.735]  The sanctuary cities and Planned Parenthood have been funded.
[00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:15.462]  So this is $12.5 billion in new military spending, $1.5 billion for border security, $100 million to combat opioid addiction, which is really rampant in this country.
[00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:19.363]  And about $300 million going to Puerto Rico's Medicaid payments.
[00:10:19.763 --> 00:10:22.064]  And again, federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
[00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:30.087]  But this money for border security is only for technology investments and repairs to existing fencing and infrastructure.
[00:10:30.187 --> 00:10:32.948]  Nothing there for Trump's promised border wall.
[00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:41.852]  Which, we may not even need a wall, because according to some people, Trump's strategy seems to be working.
[00:10:43.151 --> 00:10:43.731]  Yeah.
[00:11:03.203 --> 00:11:04.946]  That they're not showing up.
[00:11:05.507 --> 00:11:17.806]  Now the number of migrants, legal and illegal, who are crossing into the United States has dropped markedly since Trump took office, while they're also seeing recent declines in the number of deportations have been reversed.
[00:11:18.587 --> 00:11:36.025]  And so many experts on both sides of this immigration debate are saying that part of the shift is at least attributed to the sharp, unwelcoming rhetoric by Trump and his aides, as well as the administration's showy use of enforcement raids and public spotlighting of crimes committed by immigrants.
[00:11:36.546 --> 00:11:39.789]  Now, this is the Washington Post labeling it as the Trump's
[00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.950]  I think so.
[00:12:02.065 --> 00:12:07.426]  Immigration activists actually referred to President Obama as the deporter-in-chief, so there you go.
[00:12:08.047 --> 00:12:13.548]  But Trump said last week during a speech at the National Rifle Association Leadership Forum, he said,
[00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:20.971]  You'll be caught.
[00:12:21.091 --> 00:12:22.272]  You'll be returned to your home.
[00:12:22.572 --> 00:12:23.954]  You're not staying any longer.
[00:12:24.074 --> 00:12:30.100]  If you keep coming back illegally after deportation, you'll be arrested and prosecuted and put behind bars.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.941]  Otherwise, it will never end.
[00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:32.902]  And that's absolutely right.
[00:12:32.922 --> 00:12:39.068]  Because as we see, these people are perpetually being deported and then they just come right back in because there's no tough... It's like it's...
[00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:45.431]  It's worth the chance for them to take to come back in the country because they're not really facing any repercussions for that.
[00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:51.794]  But this tough stance and this border wall, the things that people voted in President Trump for these promises.
[00:12:52.154 --> 00:12:56.696]  Maxine Waters says trying to enforce the immigration laws in this country.
[00:12:56.996 --> 00:12:58.017]  Well, that's just racist.
[00:12:58.317 --> 00:12:59.398]  Your response, Congresswoman?
[00:13:00.218 --> 00:13:02.560]  That is absolutely racist.
[00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:04.762]  That's that dog whistling.
[00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:12.507]  That's saying to people, this is what is happening in America with you and all the problems that we have.
[00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:19.052]  He's using the Latino population and Mexicans right across the border.
[00:13:20.222 --> 00:13:26.786]  To create fear in his constituency and those people who tend to want to believe that.
[00:13:27.227 --> 00:13:28.868]  It is absolutely divisive.
[00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:32.130]  Maxine Waters, come on, stay woke, right?
[00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.553]  You gotta stick to what the millennials are into and they're not into that divisive rhetoric.
[00:13:37.113 --> 00:13:42.197]  But Democrats say they now know exactly why Clinton lost.
[00:13:42.257 --> 00:13:45.240]  And it had nothing to do with racist, sexist, homophobia.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.783]  It's that people were sick and tired of President Obama's policies, apparently.
[00:13:49.803 --> 00:13:53.506]  And this is according to a group of top Democratic Party strategists.
[00:13:54.047 --> 00:14:01.193]  They used new data about last year's presidential election to reach a startling conclusion about why Hillary Clinton lost.
[00:14:01.673 --> 00:14:07.556]  So it's not because her base didn't turn out, and Donald Trump's did, and the difference was too much to overcome.
[00:14:08.176 --> 00:14:14.519]  The new information shows that Clinton had a much bigger problem with voters who supported President Barack Obama in 2012.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.382]  But then those same voters went around to back Trump four years later.
[00:14:19.862 --> 00:14:25.965]  So they effectively accounted for more than two-thirds of the reasons Clinton lost.
[00:14:26.505 --> 00:14:28.946]  And it's because she lost these voters.
[00:14:29.087 --> 00:14:34.930]  And it's because people could see that Hillary Clinton was going to be Obama 2.0, and they weren't having it.
[00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.711]  Two-thirds of those voters turned to Trump.
[00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:42.374]  So that, there you go, this is inside the DNC, the Democratic operatives.
[00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:52.140]  This is the conclusions that they've come to, and they're really hoping that the rest of the party will get the message that it's not because the American people were racist, sexist, homophobic, and that they were
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.121]  I don't.
[00:15:08.204 --> 00:15:08.745]  I don't know.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:44.947]  But now, some transcript has been released from the most recent hearing, and the DNC attorneys claim that Article 5, Section 4 of the DNC Charter, which stipulates that the DNC Chair and their staff must ensure neutrality in the primaries, they say
[00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:47.228]  It's just a discretionary rule.
[00:15:47.288 --> 00:15:48.969]  It doesn't need to be adopted to begin with.
[00:15:49.369 --> 00:15:58.715]  So they're basically asserting that the court cannot interpret, claim, or rule on anything associated with whether the DNC should remain neutral in their presidential primaries.
[00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:04.458]  They're basically saying the DNC has the right to pick the candidates in these back rooms.
[00:16:04.758 --> 00:16:11.643]  We don't care if the voters think that these primaries are fair and that their guy or gal would actually have a shot.
[00:16:12.823 --> 00:16:20.165]  And the attorneys also argue that the DNC has previously... Sanders supporters knew the primaries were rigged.
[00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:21.966]  So this is the argument the attorneys are making.
[00:16:22.086 --> 00:16:42.132]  They knew it was rigged, you know, so that right there nulls any kind of potential accountability that the DNC might have had to make it appear as if they were fair, which is total crap, because if they knew that it was rigged going into it, they would not have sent the money to the DNC in hopes to prop up Bernie Sanders' potential run.
[00:16:42.572 --> 00:16:56.266]  So that right there is the argument and that's why these people are very angry because they were being lied to again and again and again with these campaign emails saying, oh we need your funding and then all that funding was going mostly to support Hillary Clinton because they were rigged!
[00:16:57.387 --> 00:17:03.529]  And I guess Donald Trump and his campaign, they're already working on election 2020.
[00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:17.393]  Trump for president spent a million and a half dollars to run TV ads showing President Trump's first 100 days and they took out these ads because they said you're not going to hear this from the media.
[00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.054]  The mainstream media has just painted
[00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:22.717]  President Trump's first 100 days as a total failure.
[00:17:23.177 --> 00:17:29.322]  Meanwhile, the exact same 100 days with President Obama was just filled with like glowing poetry of how great he was.
[00:17:29.803 --> 00:17:35.567]  And so you can see there in President Trump's ad where he's saying, look, these are my initial achievements.
[00:17:35.627 --> 00:17:37.409]  Companies investing in American jobs.
[00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:39.931]  America is becoming more energy independent.
[00:17:39.991 --> 00:17:42.713]  Regulations that kill American jobs have been eliminated.
[00:17:43.294 --> 00:17:45.336]  And the biggest tax cut plan in history.
[00:17:46.016 --> 00:17:46.598]  I don't think so.
[00:17:56.563 --> 00:18:05.565]  If you wanted to kind of see anything about where the left is headed and the media that supports them, look no further than the New York Times.
[00:18:06.025 --> 00:18:10.006]  They are putting out an opinion piece, so just an opinion.
[00:18:10.066 --> 00:18:12.646]  I mean, their editors have discretion of what goes out, but still.
[00:18:13.206 --> 00:18:16.787]  It's titled, When Communism Inspired Americans.
[00:18:17.067 --> 00:18:17.747]  That's right.
[00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:21.268]  They are just looking, harking back to those lovely old days.
[00:18:22.148 --> 00:18:23.749]  About when communism inspired Americans.
[00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:30.891]  It didn't, actually, but it did inspire the left to try and turn America into a totalitarian state.
[00:18:31.292 --> 00:18:35.933]  And so that's why they're constantly, the left, is constantly going back and looking at how wonderful it was.
[00:18:36.974 --> 00:18:40.775]  This front page mag really rips into this New York Times article.
[00:18:41.175 --> 00:18:47.638]  They're quoting all the paragraphs so you can just see the kind of the glowing prose for this horrifying ideology.
[00:18:47.718 --> 00:18:50.359]  If you can get past all the killings, Stalin was a good guy.
[00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:09.360]  Info Wars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:15.986]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:24.513]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:30.397]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.519]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:39.544]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:19:39.884 --> 00:19:40.344]  It works!
[00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:48.907]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:58.509]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time!
[00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:59.330]  A total 360 win!
[00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:03.192]  You provided Alex with the caveman?
[00:20:03.212 --> 00:20:04.252]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:20.438]  No, I'm not.
[00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:21.119]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.139 --> 00:20:21.699]  I'm terrible.
[00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:28.943]  But the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:36.767]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:40.289]  And that's just from my personal experience.
[00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.915]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:50.038]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[00:20:50.438 --> 00:20:51.740]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.321]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:54.522]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[00:20:54.542 --> 00:21:01.729]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:09.934]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:11.675]  I felt it immediately.
[00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:13.916]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:17.078]  Like, I'm really picky, and I will drink it.
[00:21:17.098 --> 00:21:18.238]  It tastes good to me.
[00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:22.280]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.462]  So, I mean, if the bone broth...
[00:21:27.043 --> 00:21:28.143]  Bone broth!
[00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:33.345]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known, because it tastes really good.
[00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:37.106]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[00:21:37.146 --> 00:21:44.908]  So ladies, get yourselves some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already, because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[00:21:44.968 --> 00:21:48.309]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my feet.
[00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:49.970]  Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:56.886]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street, and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[00:21:57.247 --> 00:21:58.229]  No fear, nothing, so...
[00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:06.462]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[00:22:07.002 --> 00:22:08.843]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[00:22:09.563 --> 00:22:20.105]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go onto our store and donate.
[00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:21.405]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:27.546]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:31.047]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[00:22:31.107 --> 00:22:33.287]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:41.389]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:44.750]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.631]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[00:22:47.731 --> 00:22:52.772]  So once again, we've got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us.
[00:22:53.832 --> 00:23:00.714]  Even when we make mistakes, and even when we're not right, and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[00:23:05.896 --> 00:23:08.097]  Well, my friend, what is the big breaking news today?
[00:23:08.717 --> 00:23:22.682]  Well, I can now tell you authoritatively, Alex, that the president has been informed of the coming resignation of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy through a back channel.
[00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:24.842]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.671]  So you're giving us the exclusive?
[00:23:51.691 --> 00:23:52.412]  This hasn't broken yet?
[00:24:10.467 --> 00:24:12.428]  This has not broken yet.
[00:24:12.528 --> 00:24:29.277]  Let me continue, if I may, and say that Senator Charles Grassley has his own candidate who is not Judge Hartigan for this slot and has made the White House very aware of the
[00:24:32.381 --> 00:24:36.048]  But the big news is, is that the Justice Kennedy is stepping down.
[00:24:42.694 --> 00:24:46.375]  I think that's the news, but I also think a quick handicap is crucial here.
[00:24:46.795 --> 00:24:54.237]  Hardigan the frontrunner, Grassley with his own candidate that we will identify here at Info Wars, perhaps when we get together.
[00:24:54.257 --> 00:25:00.139]  And then of course the dark horse in this, and this is very important, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:03.720]  Now what's not known, Alex, is whether the president
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.902]  is going to go to the list that he released in the election.
[00:25:07.982 --> 00:25:14.225]  He only said that he would choose his first justice from that list, and indeed he did.
[00:25:14.245 --> 00:25:21.889]  If the lists were out the window and he had a broader selection, Partigan was on the list.
[00:25:22.449 --> 00:25:25.791]  Grassley's candidate was not a judge on the list.
[00:25:25.831 --> 00:25:29.613]  And of course, Judge Napolitano is the outside the box.
[00:25:31.174 --> 00:25:44.543]  Well, a little bird told me, and I checked with another bird, that Trump promised to go off the list for the first one, but said on the second one he was leaning towards Napolitano.
[00:25:44.803 --> 00:25:45.464]  Was that accurate?
[00:25:46.617 --> 00:25:47.478]  I had heard that, too.
[00:25:47.518 --> 00:25:58.168]  I think what he said was he was leaning towards a more libertarian-oriented choice, and we know that he's fond of the judge, so that's at a minimum.
[00:25:58.188 --> 00:25:59.889]  Napolitano's so incredibly smart.
[00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:00.730]  He's got the background.
[00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.092]  They put a lot of big state judges in the Supreme Court before.
[00:26:03.392 --> 00:26:04.753]  It would energize Trump's base.
[00:26:05.154 --> 00:26:06.715]  I mean, you talk about a death blow.
[00:26:06.775 --> 00:26:09.237]  Judge Andrew Napolitano on the Supreme Court?
[00:26:09.257 --> 00:26:09.318]  Man!
[00:26:12.511 --> 00:26:13.552]  You're absolutely right.
[00:26:13.952 --> 00:26:21.834]  Look, Felix Frankfurter was a state jurist, I believe, before going to the bench, one of the greatest Supreme Court justices.
[00:26:21.854 --> 00:26:27.156]  So this is going to cause a ripple in official Washington.
[00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:38.579]  The president clearly, as I said earlier, has been told that a letter from Justice Kennedy is supposedly imminent.
[00:26:39.104 --> 00:26:41.065]  All right, we're going to get a transcript of this out right now.
[00:26:41.185 --> 00:26:47.869]  Roger Stone, the president, has been told that the letter is imminent of Justice Kennedy's resignation.
[00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:55.354]  Let's put that out right now, get this snipped out this last five minutes and put up on YouTube and Facebook as soon as possible.
[00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:57.555]  And of course, you've given us so many big exclusives.
[00:26:58.055 --> 00:27:05.360]  I guess this will be one more fake news story like Cernovich getting it directly from the White House that it was Susan Rice that did the leaking.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.600]  Well, let me say this, Alex.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:14.222]  Now that we have made this public, it's imminent in Washington time, a week, two weeks, three months, a month.
[00:27:14.702 --> 00:27:17.463]  But this is surely coming, this retirement.
[00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:27.685]  Once we expose the politics of it, obviously liberals will urge Kennedy to hang on, not wanting to hand President Trump yet another seat.
[00:27:27.725 --> 00:27:28.065]  Sure, sure.
[00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:29.886]  Well, the statesman's asking, is he getting ready?
[00:27:29.906 --> 00:27:30.906]  You say the word, as he is.
[00:27:40.811 --> 00:27:50.959]  ABC News recently broadcast pure propaganda to all of its supposed cheap viewers about the recent mass use of the mysterious term, Deep State.
[00:27:51.299 --> 00:28:00.205]  The Deep State is the notion that there is a network of career government employees who are secretly manipulating government policy.
[00:28:00.506 --> 00:28:06.430]  They could have positions in the military, intelligence agencies, or other areas of government.
[00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:16.599]  Supporters of President Donald Trump point to leaks from career bureaucrats who they say are undermining his agenda.
[00:28:16.879 --> 00:28:25.526]  Many write the Deep State off as a conspiracy theory because no evidence of an organized effort has surfaced.
[00:28:25.766 --> 00:28:30.070]  The phrase was originally used to refer to power dynamics.
[00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.751]  I'm good.
[00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.332]  The evolution of the deep state reads like a U.S.
[00:28:52.373 --> 00:28:53.073]  history book.
[00:28:53.434 --> 00:28:58.939]  In 1947, Harry S. Truman created the CIA by signing the National Security Act.
[00:28:59.039 --> 00:29:07.727]  Founding members of the CIA included Skull and Bones member Prescott Bush and the dynamic duo Allen Dulles and John Foster Dulles.
[00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:24.578]  Hastily, the Office of Policy Coordination was formed in 1948, Radio Free Europe in 1949, Operation Mockingbird in the 1950s, where at least 25 media organizations and 400 journalists immediately became CIA assets.
[00:29:24.878 --> 00:29:27.760]  MKUltra Mind Control Operations began around 1953.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:40.626]  The 1961 Deep State Coup of our Executive Branch as Alan Dulles led the Operation Mongoose fiasco resulting in the Bay of Pigs that nearly annihilated the United States.
[00:29:40.766 --> 00:29:52.492]  The JFK assassination, which we will know more about the Deep State's actual involvement as the 25th anniversary allows secret documents to be released in October of this year.
[00:29:52.592 --> 00:29:54.573]  The false Gulf of Tonkin narrative
[00:29:54.693 --> 00:29:58.996]  The murder of over 20,000 Vietnamese civilians in Operation Phoenix.
[00:29:59.316 --> 00:30:03.820]  Operation Chaos, which tracked thousands of protesters and organizations.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.521]  The Iran-Contra Affair.
[00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:11.825]  The weapons of mass destruction lies to get us into the Iraq War and the deconstruction of the Middle East.
[00:30:11.965 --> 00:30:14.467]  And that is merely scratching the surface.
[00:30:14.487 --> 00:30:15.348]  It would be easier.
[00:30:16.048 --> 00:30:20.231]  If it were a conspiracy you're describing, but that's not the case, is it?
[00:30:20.512 --> 00:30:23.094]  This is something that hides in plain sight.
[00:30:23.714 --> 00:30:33.882]  It's kind of a natural evolution when so much money and political control is at stake in the most powerful country in the world.
[00:30:34.342 --> 00:30:36.304]  This has evolved over time.
[00:30:36.744 --> 00:30:40.346]  It's all the national security functions of the government.
[00:30:40.406 --> 00:30:41.467]  It's the Pentagon.
[00:30:41.527 --> 00:30:43.688]  It's Homeland Security.
[00:30:43.868 --> 00:30:45.289]  It's the State Department.
[00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:52.013]  It's also Treasury because they have a kind of symbiotic relationship with Wall Street.
[00:30:52.273 --> 00:30:59.917]  And here we are in 2017 as the Deep State draws China and Russia into a great war over Syria and North Korea.
[00:31:00.097 --> 00:31:10.062]  Meanwhile, the continuity of government plan ensures that the Deep State will keep rolling on as US citizens are decimated due to one catastrophe or another.
[00:31:10.263 --> 00:31:16.746]  So you see, the Deep State actually isn't a hidden organization or a conspiracy theory.
[00:31:16.986 --> 00:31:31.378]  It is a taxpayer-funded factory of death and subversion, producing the elite initiatives of the banker Wall Street class carried out by a group of well-known federal organizations that have officially molded U.S.
[00:31:31.418 --> 00:31:37.584]  history for the past 70 years by acting further and further outside of the U.S.
[00:31:37.664 --> 00:31:39.705]  Constitution as time goes by.
[00:31:41.727 --> 00:31:50.815]  We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:31:51.436 --> 00:31:55.779]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:06.689]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning
[00:32:07.495 --> 00:32:10.739]  To the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.424]  So, who is pushing the conspiracy theory now?
[00:32:14.684 --> 00:32:16.527]  American broadcasting company?
[00:32:16.807 --> 00:32:19.170]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.213]  You traitors claiming I'm a Ruski agent?
[00:32:21.513 --> 00:32:23.496]  Say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:32:23.736 --> 00:32:24.397]  I'm sick of it.
[00:32:24.617 --> 00:32:39.121]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots, while we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a risky agent?
[00:32:39.361 --> 00:32:41.081]  I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:47.063]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:32:47.503 --> 00:32:51.304]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:02.628 --> 00:33:03.969]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:04.989]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:06.569]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.690]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.610]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.211]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.411 --> 00:33:13.132]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.172 --> 00:33:16.753]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.993 --> 00:33:23.836]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.030]  Please.
[00:35:32.891 --> 00:35:34.312]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:40.105]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:36:40.185 --> 00:36:41.345]  And I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:42.866]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:36:43.586 --> 00:36:50.289]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.997]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.037 --> 00:36:58.798]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.919 --> 00:36:59.880]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:12.275]  The left is very excited about a revival of their favorite feminist fairy tale, The Handmaid's Tale.
[00:37:12.295 --> 00:37:15.377]  Of course, it was written in the mid-80s, in 1985.
[00:37:15.778 --> 00:37:23.024]  They made it into a very bad movie in 1990, and now Hulu has redone it as a series.
[00:37:23.145 --> 00:37:24.426]  And so they're very excited about this.
[00:37:24.446 --> 00:37:26.427]  They said that after Donald Trump's election,
[00:37:27.068 --> 00:37:34.577]  There was a resurgence in interest online about Orwell's 1984 and Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale.
[00:37:35.198 --> 00:37:43.408]  So I want to take a look at their fairy tale, and then I want to take a look at the reality that is all around us that they work so hard to not see.
[00:37:44.289 --> 00:37:47.611]  First of all, we've got a story here on Salon from Sarah Laden.
[00:37:48.372 --> 00:37:53.455]  She was a lecturer in humanities at a small Midwestern university, she said.
[00:37:54.136 --> 00:37:56.677]  She taught Margaret Atwood's novel, The Handmaid's Tale.
[00:37:56.717 --> 00:38:05.603]  She said, on the first day we were scheduled to discuss the text, I conspired with my co-faculty to enact a mock banning of the book.
[00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:13.669]  So she set up essentially a false flag attack, if you will, to make it look like it is a right-wing
[00:38:14.609 --> 00:38:16.270]  American censorship that's going on here.
[00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:23.114]  And, of course, the title of the article is, Why I Banned The Handmaid's Tale and Why We Need It Today More Than Ever.
[00:38:23.654 --> 00:38:30.878]  See, this is a perfect illustration of how they manipulate, first of all, manipulate her class with a false boogeyman.
[00:38:30.898 --> 00:38:37.002]  And then we'll talk about how the novel and the movies manipulate American society with a false boogeyman.
[00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:46.124]  and create this straw man of American conservative Christianity so they can avoid the reality of the Muslims that they love so much.
[00:38:46.644 --> 00:38:54.306]  She said she enlisted a campus security guard to interrupt her lecture, say that I'm going to have to confiscate every single copy of the novel.
[00:38:54.867 --> 00:39:01.748]  She said our edition had a black and red cover that had two featureless handmaids who were passing each other in a shadowy corridor.
[00:39:01.768 --> 00:39:03.149]  She said the students reacted
[00:39:03.809 --> 00:39:07.610]  With intense reactions, and some of them were very varied.
[00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.412]  She said, one of the persons said, but I paid for this, this is my own book, you can't take it.
[00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:17.554]  Another one says, yeah, I was going to sell it back, but then one person caught on and said, you're messing with us, there's no way that this is real.
[00:39:17.634 --> 00:39:26.757]  And hopefully, when you hear this report and you look at the reality, you'll understand, yeah, there's no way that this feminism that they're selling you, this is not real.
[00:39:27.714 --> 00:39:41.893]  She said then she played a brief clip from the 1990 movie version of The Handmaid's Tale and we moved on to discussing theocracies, America's Puritan roots, and anxiety and obsession over the female body.
[00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:48.732]  She said, this is all brought about because of Donald Trump, and this is the renewed interest in this.
[00:39:48.812 --> 00:40:01.515]  And she said, the resurgence of the Handmaid's Tale may come partly from the fear and anxiety of our own time, but it also shows that people want to read about censorship and literacy and not be censored and not become illiterate.
[00:40:01.555 --> 00:40:05.717]  So I want to show you what the mainstream media is censoring.
[00:40:06.217 --> 00:40:07.757]  I don't want you to be illiterate.
[00:40:07.797 --> 00:40:10.438]  I don't want you to be ignorant of the things that they want to hide from you.
[00:40:11.294 --> 00:40:16.601]  They talk about it in Ars Technica as the most horrific thing they've ever seen and that's why you need to watch it right now.
[00:40:17.642 --> 00:40:21.687]  And if you look at that picture on the article right there, do you notice something?
[00:40:22.127 --> 00:40:24.791]  You notice how she's got color in her outfit?
[00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:26.973]  How you can actually see her face?
[00:40:28.024 --> 00:40:39.052]  In the real theocracy, in the real patriarchy, that they choose not to talk about in Islam, in Sharia law, she would be considered to be an infidel whore for dressing like that.
[00:40:39.152 --> 00:40:42.834]  She would be beaten by the religious police.
[00:40:44.065 --> 00:40:47.627]  Of course, they talk about how this is half dystopia, half fairy tale.
[00:40:47.667 --> 00:40:49.628]  No, it is a full fairy tale.
[00:40:49.648 --> 00:40:53.191]  They say, the gist of the story, and here's the gist of the plot line.
[00:40:53.211 --> 00:40:58.394]  The United States, after a far-right religious group, seizes control of the government.
[00:40:58.434 --> 00:41:02.676]  We aren't quite sure, they say, how the new nation of Gilead was formed, but we hear bits and pieces about how war
[00:41:03.737 --> 00:41:04.037]  Thank you.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:31.839]  I think it's also interesting that when they talk about this and they like to couch it in terms of reproductive dystopia.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.502]  That's the way the New Yorker puts it.
[00:41:34.352 --> 00:41:47.625]  Isn't it interesting that we look at this now in light, here we are, this is 32 years ago that she wrote this novel because it was Reagan and the surgence of the Christian right that had her so concerned.
[00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:56.873]  The idea that she might lose her ability to kill babies and now we see babies are actually getting so rare and so valuable
[00:41:57.774 --> 00:42:00.095]  That they push their abortion so they can sell their baby parts.
[00:42:00.195 --> 00:42:01.935]  That's the reality that we live in today.
[00:42:02.475 --> 00:42:04.996]  And so here's an example of what is in this dystopia for them.
[00:42:05.076 --> 00:42:07.797]  Women's money is given to their husband or their male next of kin.
[00:42:08.077 --> 00:42:10.357]  All women are fired from their jobs.
[00:42:10.877 --> 00:42:13.478]  Lesbian gender traitors are hanged in public places.
[00:42:13.498 --> 00:42:16.679]  You know, not thrown off of buildings like they are in reality in Saudi Arabia.
[00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:20.903]  You can see what it's like to shop in a world where women are forbidden to read.
[00:42:20.923 --> 00:42:21.783]  Okay?
[00:42:22.064 --> 00:42:24.766]  And people might pop up and beat her at any moment.
[00:42:24.906 --> 00:42:26.588]  Well, let's talk about the reality then.
[00:42:26.768 --> 00:42:28.950]  This is their dystopia that they're selling you.
[00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.311]  Hollywood and the mainstream press.
[00:42:30.612 --> 00:42:33.674]  You have to be worried about Christians and you have to be worried about
[00:42:34.415 --> 00:42:44.850]  America because of how they're abusing people and I want you to see that all the stuff that I just read to you is happening in Saudi Arabia or even worse and they won't film the reality of it.
[00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:46.152]  Here's a story from the week.
[00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:50.037]  Seven things that women in Saudi Arabia cannot do.
[00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:53.222]  And they say there's a growing campaign in Saudi Arabia.
[00:42:53.242 --> 00:42:54.442]  They're trying to get people's attention.
[00:42:54.462 --> 00:42:56.643]  They've had actually 14,000 women sign a petition.
[00:42:57.043 --> 00:43:00.504]  And that's out of about 17.5 million women.
[00:43:01.084 --> 00:43:05.045]  So that means that 99.92% of the women have not signed this petition.
[00:43:05.065 --> 00:43:10.507]  Not necessarily because they like living like this, but because of the consequences if they push back against it.
[00:43:10.547 --> 00:43:12.187]  We'll give you some examples of what happens.
[00:43:12.527 --> 00:43:17.989]  They say the system means that women in the deeply conservative Islamic kingdom, operating under Sharia law,
[00:43:18.817 --> 00:43:20.259]  That's the reality of a handmaid's burka.
[00:43:20.279 --> 00:43:21.580]  Okay, that's what we're talking about here.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.964]  In a country where a woman cannot even open a bank account without her husband's permission.
[00:43:42.264 --> 00:43:44.026]  Here are several other things they still can't do.
[00:43:44.246 --> 00:43:44.867]  Drive a car.
[00:43:44.907 --> 00:43:53.915]  Remember we've talked about how they get so excited in this one amusement park because they can go in over the weekends where it's only women and they can drive bumper cars.
[00:43:53.935 --> 00:43:55.517]  That's the closest they can get to driving cars.
[00:43:55.797 --> 00:43:58.259]  They can't wear clothes or makeup that show their beauty.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.822]  The majority of women wear an abaya, a long cloak, a headscarf.
[00:44:01.862 --> 00:44:11.910]  The face doesn't necessarily need to be covered, much to the chagrin of some hardliners, says The Economist, but this doesn't stop the religious police from harassing you if they don't like the way that you're dressed.
[00:44:12.912 --> 00:44:14.132]  They can't interact with men.
[00:44:14.512 --> 00:44:18.233]  Women are required to limit the amount of time spent with men to whom they're not related.
[00:44:18.513 --> 00:44:24.454]  So that means that the majority of public buildings, like offices, banks, universities, have separate entrances for women.
[00:44:24.494 --> 00:44:25.634]  They've got a different entrance for you.
[00:44:25.674 --> 00:44:29.435]  Public transportation, parks, beaches, and amusement parks are also segregated.
[00:44:29.755 --> 00:44:31.315]  You can't go for a swim in public.
[00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:33.116]  You can't compete freelance sports.
[00:44:33.436 --> 00:44:37.817]  Last year, Saudi Arabia proposed hosting an Olympic Games without women.
[00:44:38.297 --> 00:44:39.117]  And of course, they want to say,
[00:44:39.657 --> 00:44:43.358]  And Handmaid's Tale, you get to see what it's like to go shopping when you're not allowed to read.
[00:44:43.718 --> 00:44:47.760]  Well, in Saudi Arabia, you can't try on clothes when you go shopping.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:54.322]  The mere thought of a disrobed woman behind a dressing room door is apparently too much for men to handle, said Vanity Fair.
[00:44:55.888 --> 00:45:01.749]  And then of the women who are able to get away from this and they can't go home.
[00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:10.052]  If they get abroad, if they're going abroad to study, many of them are afraid to go home because they go abroad and they speak out about what is happening.
[00:45:10.872 --> 00:45:23.515]  And so when we look at this, and we look at this system here, and we look at women who are abroad studying in university tweeting about what is happening, one of the things that they're concerned about is how in the world
[00:45:24.625 --> 00:45:31.089]  Can Saudi Arabia become part of the UN Women's Panel, talking about human rights for women and women's rights?
[00:45:31.789 --> 00:45:42.456]  Okay, so some of the women who do escape, they're told that the Grand Mufti has described their social media campaign to try to bring awareness to the condition of women in Saudi Arabia.
[00:45:42.796 --> 00:45:47.779]  He called it a quote, crime targeting the Saudi and Muslim society.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.942]  But here's an example of some of the women who don't make it out and aren't allowed to speak.
[00:45:52.762 --> 00:45:55.725]  One woman, Miriam, this is on HumanRightsWatch.org.
[00:45:56.526 --> 00:45:57.126]  She's 29.
[00:45:57.186 --> 00:45:58.768]  She fled an abusive family.
[00:45:59.328 --> 00:46:05.033]  She got to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, only to be captured by authorities and jailed for trying to escape.
[00:46:05.674 --> 00:46:08.676]  She had lived for years under oppressive male guardianship.
[00:46:08.716 --> 00:46:13.441]  She had complained, filed a complaint against her brother, who she said was abusing her.
[00:46:13.641 --> 00:46:15.443]  Her family stopped the complaint.
[00:46:15.983 --> 00:46:18.645]  They filed a counter-complaint of disobedience.
[00:46:19.486 --> 00:46:22.808]  And then they returned her to her family, put her in jail.
[00:46:23.169 --> 00:46:32.455]  Another woman tried to flee to Australia from Kuwait to escape the restrictions, only to be returned to Saudi Arabia, caught at the airport, and returned.
[00:46:32.735 --> 00:46:33.976]  This is the reality, folks.
[00:46:34.536 --> 00:46:35.236]  This is reality.
[00:46:35.336 --> 00:46:41.841]  And yet, the UN Human Rights Commission has Saudi Arabia as a member.
[00:46:42.947 --> 00:46:51.250]  The Geneva-based human rights group, UN Watch, condemned UN's election of Saudi Arabia, called them the most misogynistic regime in the world.
[00:46:51.791 --> 00:46:54.211]  One that the left won't talk about.
[00:46:54.291 --> 00:46:57.293]  They won't show you movies of what's happening, the reality.
[00:46:57.313 --> 00:46:58.353]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:47:02.995 --> 00:47:07.737]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.116]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.316 --> 00:48:30.300]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.064]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.204 --> 00:48:37.326]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.386 --> 00:48:45.654]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.794 --> 00:48:48.415]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.435 --> 00:48:49.476]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:50.496]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.536 --> 00:48:51.157]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.517 --> 00:48:59.060]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.961]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.021]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.852 --> 00:49:08.673]  This is Michael Zimmerman for Infowars.com.
[00:49:08.893 --> 00:49:18.259]  We're here at the NRA show in Atlanta, Georgia, and I'm here with Craig Sawyer, who has started a project recently to expose and bring down some of the pedophile networks out there.
[00:49:18.279 --> 00:49:19.680]  Can you tell us a little more about that?
[00:49:20.416 --> 00:49:37.897]  Well we've started a non-profit organization called Veterans for Child Rescue and the website is VetsForChildRescue.org and we are raising the money to shoot a documentary series to expose high-level elite pedophile rings that are snatching up our children.
[00:49:38.577 --> 00:49:40.558]  And doing unthinkable things to them.
[00:49:40.638 --> 00:49:41.859]  There's an aspect of this.
[00:49:41.919 --> 00:49:46.261]  Some of them are into satanic rituals and actually torturing children to death.
[00:49:46.561 --> 00:49:48.042]  Little infants and toddlers.
[00:49:48.762 --> 00:49:57.506]  It's really, really hard to digest and accept, but I'm getting high-level information about it from federal law enforcement and the intelligence community.
[00:49:58.506 --> 00:50:05.730]  There have been over 3,000 arrests already just since January, so we've got a president now that is not okay with childs being
[00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.490]  Children being raped and tortured to death.
[00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:09.411]  So, thank God.
[00:50:10.171 --> 00:50:21.633]  So, with all these arrests going on, I've been learning more and more about it, and I realized, okay, I'm going to have to go independent to get around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media, who apparently aren't inclined to cover it.
[00:50:22.053 --> 00:50:23.594]  So, we're going to show the American public.
[00:50:23.834 --> 00:50:32.776]  So, my mission is, that I've taken on, is to inform the American citizens of what they've been denied knowing.
[00:50:32.856 --> 00:50:33.816]  So, what I want to do is
[00:50:35.683 --> 00:50:51.582]  Make a non-permissive environment out of the United States for these acts against the children so that we can see something and say something and report what's going on and make a better environment for the children going forward because right now, if you knew what was going on, the level of
[00:50:53.686 --> 00:50:55.607]  What these children are going through, it'll just break your heart.
[00:50:55.727 --> 00:50:57.128]  So we got to do something.
[00:50:57.329 --> 00:50:58.830]  And I've got a background and connections.
[00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:09.577]  I've assembled an alliance, a task force, if you will, of high-level intelligence retirees and veterans and spec ops veterans that are very capable.
[00:51:09.837 --> 00:51:19.304]  And so we're going to shoot this documentary and go and rip the lid off and shine the light, shine the sunlight on this cesspool of corruption and help clean it up.
[00:51:19.946 --> 00:51:24.792]  So InfoWars has been attacked in the past when we've gone after pedophile rings, especially those involving the elite.
[00:51:25.152 --> 00:51:29.957]  Have you faced any pushback so far from the elite or any other groups?
[00:51:30.632 --> 00:51:50.038]  Yeah, immediately after I went on InfoWars with Alex and announced the founding of our organization, I got a phone call from the intelligence community saying, hey Craig, there are two specific groups that are sitting up and freaking out and panicking about you and your new organization, and they're already planning their attacks.
[00:51:50.358 --> 00:51:51.179]  And so they're planning
[00:51:52.379 --> 00:51:54.921]  Smears against your your character and background.
[00:51:54.941 --> 00:52:00.065]  They're gonna attack your funding and they're gonna bring legal attacks So we already know who those groups are.
[00:52:00.085 --> 00:52:14.495]  So I'm just sitting back Waiting for their attacks because I'm gonna allow their attacks to flip the lights on and illuminate what they're doing So they're they're gonna bring about their own downfall by attacking us.
[00:52:14.555 --> 00:52:17.737]  So it's kind of a beautiful justice, but they've done it to themselves.
[00:52:17.797 --> 00:52:19.878]  So Yeah, there's pushback
[00:52:21.508 --> 00:52:24.690]  Social media is suppressing my reach.
[00:52:25.711 --> 00:52:31.534]  Crowdfunding sites have undermined our operations, our ability, but yet we are moving forward.
[00:52:31.574 --> 00:52:41.441]  So every day we're gaining more support from high-level officials and it's a grassroots movement that's growing, growing very quickly.
[00:52:41.481 --> 00:52:46.404]  So we're thankful for everybody out there looking at this and recognizing it and climbing on board.
[00:52:47.338 --> 00:52:48.999]  So tell us again how people can can help.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:59.205]  Okay right now if you go to VetsForChildRescue.org we've got right now a PayPal situation where you can go and just start donating.
[00:52:59.225 --> 00:53:00.126]  We need the crowdfund.
[00:53:00.146 --> 00:53:03.348]  We need to raise the funds to shoot this documentary series.
[00:53:03.408 --> 00:53:05.950]  So funding is number one and sharing it number two.
[00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:12.534]  A lot of people don't know that this is going on yet and we are very early days in our organization so people don't know we're here yet so we need
[00:53:13.114 --> 00:53:13.334]  Absolutely.
[00:53:13.374 --> 00:53:14.295]  Well, thank you very much, Craig.
[00:53:41.926 --> 00:53:44.561]  This has been Michael Zimmerman and Craig Sawyer for InfoWars.com
[00:53:50.879 --> 00:53:56.263]  Well, a new anti-Soros group has launched an effort to fight internet censorship.
[00:53:56.283 --> 00:54:04.589]  And this is being launched by people who would absolutely know what's going on there in Silicon Valley and how they are colluding with these big NGOs and other groups.
[00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:06.811]  So this is a non-profit group.
[00:54:07.211 --> 00:54:08.912]  It's called Free Our Internet.
[00:54:09.013 --> 00:54:17.139]  It's launching with the goal to expose efforts by Silicon Valley monopolies and the radical tech left to take control of the internet.
[00:54:17.919 --> 00:54:19.460]  And it's a non-profit citizens group.
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:32.727]  And they're going to educate Americans about how leftist super elites and their powerful corporate allies have methodically used their wealth and political influence to erode the public's internet freedoms and wage war on alternative media.
[00:54:33.528 --> 00:54:38.451]  It is being founded by Donald Trump's main campaign director, Christy Lee McNally.
[00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:45.815]  And she points out that under President Obama, the Internet was taken away from the American people.
[00:54:46.335 --> 00:54:56.221]  But if you had paid any attention to the media, it sounds like these groups are wanting to give us net neutrality and the free and open Internet.
[00:54:56.261 --> 00:54:57.481]  It must be protected.
[00:54:57.501 --> 00:55:00.323]  So again, it's that Orwellian doublespeak.
[00:55:00.663 --> 00:55:04.589]  And so here they're really trying to break it down and simplify it for the American people.
[00:55:04.629 --> 00:55:09.897]  You can find the link to research more about this group and how you can get involved in your own communities.
[00:55:10.218 --> 00:55:14.584]  We have that link within this article up at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:15.926 --> 00:55:28.454]  But they're pointing out how for years the left and their corporate allies have paid lip service to internet freedom, but in reality they're working tirelessly to undermine that freedom by supporting efforts to make the internet less free.
[00:55:28.994 --> 00:55:42.202]  Chad Wilkinson, who's the spokesperson for Free Our Internet, explained to InfoWars.com that the group is targeting George Soros, the Ford Foundation, and Google, as well as other Silicon Valley giants, including Google and Facebook,
[00:55:42.782 --> 00:55:48.066]  So these are groups on the political left that have championed Obama-era FCC-issued Internet regulations.
[00:55:48.566 --> 00:56:00.534]  And of course they told us it was to protect Internet privacy and to push net neutrality, but really what these efforts are doing is handing Internet control over to the government.
[00:56:01.094 --> 00:56:02.896]  And you're actually seeing a lot of arg...
[00:56:04.036 --> 00:56:04.256]  I don't
[00:56:23.217 --> 00:56:32.964]  That's what that's what's really going on behind this is that it's going to put more power in the hands of these politically leftist groups who need the Internet to be able to push their political agenda.
[00:56:33.644 --> 00:56:39.068]  So they're trying to really ram this through quickly while telling us that they're going to be doing the exact opposite.
[00:56:39.088 --> 00:56:40.148]  It's for all of us.
[00:56:40.729 --> 00:56:46.633]  And indeed, Facebook, they might not be able to control what's going on in their content, but they can't control you.
[00:56:47.273 --> 00:56:59.100]  Now we've reported how in 2012 they did an experiment where they were trying to control people's feeds by seeing if they could make them feel positive or negative moods based on the type of content that was popping up in their feed.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:08.586]  Well now some new leaked documents from this year reveal that Facebook conducted research to target emotionally vulnerable and insecure youth.
[00:57:09.326 --> 00:57:22.698]  So they're actually looking at what these young people are putting in their Facebook accounts and these are these are vulnerable youth who need a confidence boost and they're using that to facilitate predatory advertising practices.
[00:57:22.758 --> 00:57:24.899]  So they're going after these kids looking at their
[00:57:25.848 --> 00:57:49.284]  Looking at what they're posting and so they can figure out when people as young as 14 feel defeated, overwhelmed, stressed, anxious, nervous, stupid, silly, useless and a failure and so then they use that this is a system it's dubbed sentiment analysis and they could use that to send it to advertisers who can then target young people on Facebook
[00:57:49.844 --> 00:57:52.145]  When they are potentially more vulnerable.
[00:57:52.285 --> 00:57:59.367]  So this is incredible to just see how something like Facebook or these other tech giants are utilizing their power.
[00:57:59.987 --> 00:58:04.989]  And of course data is the most valuable thing that any corporation has right now.
[00:58:05.049 --> 00:58:05.989]  And so we're seeing how they're
[00:58:06.449 --> 00:58:13.096]  Exploiting it, and if you want a little red flag for that, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
[00:58:13.236 --> 00:58:23.306]  actually said the day is here when they will be using your algorithms to assist in courtroom fact-finding or even judicial decision-making.
[00:58:23.346 --> 00:58:24.327]  That's already here.
[00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:28.411]  Someone has already been sentenced to six years in prison
[00:58:29.332 --> 00:58:47.708]  Based in part on a private company's proprietary software, and it was a report that was generated by the software's secret algorithm, and it showed that the judge was able to kind of take this bar chart system from the algorithms that said this person, Mr. Loomis, would be a high risk.
[00:58:47.929 --> 00:58:50.271]  And so based on that algorithmic assessment,
[00:58:50.791 --> 00:58:52.753]  He got six years in prison, and there you go!
[00:58:52.934 --> 00:58:54.716]  And that's how they can use your status.
