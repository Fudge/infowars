[00:00:06.164 --> 00:00:08.266]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.347]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.347 --> 00:00:13.550]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.291]  Do you want answers?
[00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:17.453]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:17.453 --> 00:00:23.777]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:46.788]  Well, I told you Saturday in a special transmission I did hear from the studios that the word is a new special counsel is being prepared for Hillary.
[00:00:46.788 --> 00:01:01.056]  But also for everybody else involved with Uranium One, that means John Podesta, Tony Podesta, Robert Mueller, the entire list of the Legion of Doom, the normal cast of characters.
[00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:01.416]  And now,
[00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:16.103]  Former Senator and now Attorney General Jeff Sessions testifying today has said that they are open to a special counsel and that they are considering doing it.
[00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:26.870]  It's also in responses to congressional leaders that have already launched hearings asking why are we going after Trump when there's no evidence?
[00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.812]  But then there's complete open and shut cases against the Democrats.
[00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:31.413]  Separately,
[00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.147]  Separately, Donald Trump Jr.
[00:01:36.147 --> 00:01:44.389]  released his whopping three communications with WikiLeaks during the campaign, asking for information.
[00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:49.370]  I mean, during the campaign, Julian Assange was on CNN.
[00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.911]  Julian Assange was on Fox News.
[00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.931]  Julian Assange did New York Times interviews.
[00:01:53.931 --> 00:02:02.414]  He doesn't do them now because they just lie and attack him, but by the extension that you're a Russian agent, if you talk to Julian Assange, when there's no evidence that Julian Assange
[00:02:03.294 --> 00:02:04.455]  is a Russian agent.
[00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:08.417]  It's just crazy.
[00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:11.760]  It's absolutely amazing, but they're back at it.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:23.647]  There have been hundreds of news articles the last week by fake news outlets like the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, this anti-free speech monopoly man, going, we need to have drugs reports shut down.
[00:02:23.647 --> 00:02:25.569]  He linked to InfoWars.
[00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.291]  InfoWars links to Russian news.
[00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:30.352]  That's total mental illness.
[00:02:32.142 --> 00:02:34.424]  Then of course we did an analysis of it on average.
[00:02:34.424 --> 00:02:35.925]  It's an average month.
[00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:41.709]  Drudge links to those sites ten times more than InfoWars or Breitbart.
[00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.151]  So he links the New York Times and Washington Post.
[00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:51.176]  Does that mean he works the New York Times or the Washington Post?
[00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:52.937]  It's just next level.
[00:02:55.407 --> 00:03:10.859]  Ladies and gentlemen, and they did analysis showing how much he links to InfoWars versus how much he links to RT or Sputnik, but then they don't show you how much they're linking to other mainstream so-called mainstream news, establishment news.
[00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:22.729]  But as you can see, the traffic is way, way, way, way above the amount of Washington Post traffic that InfoWars would get is 10 times or more.
[00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:26.648]  We show up at what?
[00:03:26.648 --> 00:03:31.571]  About 15% right there, and they're up at 400%.
[00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:32.232]  So do the math.
[00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:33.473]  If we're at 15%, they're 400%.
[00:03:33.473 --> 00:03:37.296]  I guess that's way more than 10 times.
[00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:39.097]  I was just eyeballing it.
[00:03:39.097 --> 00:03:39.998]  What's the percentage?
[00:03:39.998 --> 00:03:45.162]  If I'm at 15%, or 20%, let's say 20's a peak, and they're at 400%, the links,
[00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.479]  We have a calculator?
[00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.420]  It's way more than 10 times.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.460]  20 times.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.760]  20 times?
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.640]  20 times.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.861]  So excuse me, it's 20 times.
[00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:10.943]  And the response that Drudge gets for literally flooding Jeff Bezos with money and traffic is, we want to shut you down, you're a Russian agent.
[00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:18.104]  They have all these other articles saying, there's a Federal Elections Commission investigation and a Federal Trade Commission investigation, and Drudge then
[00:04:20.598 --> 00:04:25.623]  Tweets out that he's responsible for 37% of their traffic.
[00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:26.644]  And how do they respond?
[00:04:26.644 --> 00:04:30.348]  Urinating directly in his face and calling for his arrest.
[00:04:30.348 --> 00:04:34.632]  That is the entitled SJW arrogance of a man worth $100 billion.
[00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:53.169]  In one company, Jeff Bezos, with the Washington Post, hell-bent on shutting down free speech in America, and he even got $500 million this year in CIA money, one of the last things Obama did to run propaganda.
[00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.371]  I mean, he even gets taxpayer money, that pig!
[00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:08.857]  We're running the biggest specials we've run in like six months and free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:08.857 --> 00:05:13.240]  And when we sell products at this low a price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.564]  But I know the products are so good, that even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more.
[00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:32.153]  Especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash, or our vitamin mineral fusion, fruit punch drink, it's got all the amino acids and multivitamins, our probiotic, all of it, super male vitality.
[00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:34.895]  50% off, never done that, and free shipping.
[00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:35.636]  Boom.
[00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:38.398]  Super Filmo Vitality, 50% off, with free shipping.
[00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:38.919]  Boom.
[00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.641]  Bomb Defense, 50% off, with free shipping.
[00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.843]  With the free shipping, folks, it's a lost leader.
[00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:47.326]  You sign up for auto ship, we're losing like six, seven dollars on this.
[00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:49.368]  Doesn't matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[00:05:49.368 --> 00:05:55.693]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[00:06:08.044 --> 00:06:19.648]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.648 --> 00:06:25.490]  Okay, to say that today is an overload of news again is really putting it lightly.
[00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:34.912]  Wow!
[00:06:34.912 --> 00:06:36.013]  We notice themes
[00:06:37.321 --> 00:06:41.503]  that developed in the news without even looking.
[00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:53.930]  Every day, I see five or six news articles of anti-Trumpers caught with bombs, caught with weapons, planning mass killing sprees.
[00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:02.255]  Now, whenever they get caught, it's just a local news story, when they hit a big target, like the church,
[00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:12.263]  A week and a half ago here in Texas, south of Austin, Texas, in Sutherland, it gets covered up.
[00:07:12.263 --> 00:07:14.084]  But here are just two today.
[00:07:14.084 --> 00:07:20.649]  Anti-Trump arrested for killing spree talk, had a bunch of weapons, was planning to kill Trump supporters.
[00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:21.389]  And here's another one.
[00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.992]  Leftists who wanted to kill first responders found with arsenal
[00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:29.026]  200 containers and bomb-making materials.
[00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:35.587]  31-year-old Christopher Langer lived with his parents and said he was planning to kill Trump supporters.
[00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:49.830]  He told them, look at that basement-dwelling, mentally ill troll that goes around projecting his hatred of himself onto everybody.
[00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.591]  And there are legions of these goblin creatures
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.003]  Who think it's totally normal to attack you.
[00:07:57.003 --> 00:08:00.367]  In fact, we've had this activist on before.
[00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:07.416]  And again, I have nothing against her, because she's not sexualizing children.
[00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:09.298]  But we've had her on before.
[00:08:09.298 --> 00:08:10.299]  She's never back on.
[00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:13.023]  Very articulate, smart person.
[00:08:13.023 --> 00:08:13.643]  Blair White?
[00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:17.732]  I would say attractive trans.
[00:08:17.732 --> 00:08:18.573]  Usually they're not.
[00:08:18.573 --> 00:08:24.178]  It's kind of refreshing that she isn't super ugly and doesn't weigh 500 pounds, but sorry I'm digressing.
[00:08:24.178 --> 00:08:31.664]  Trans activists assaulted in Hollywood for wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
[00:08:31.664 --> 00:08:36.808]  And two men wearing the little pink hats that we can't say the name of
[00:08:39.434 --> 00:08:49.079]  They come up and physically attack her, and then her friend, who's a woman, goes after him, so they then run from the women.
[00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:50.740]  So, there you go.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.862]  And of course, it's beta-cuck males, white males, that did it.
[00:08:55.862 --> 00:08:57.944]  So, that's what they do.
[00:08:57.944 --> 00:09:01.785]  And this is all over the United States, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:01.785 --> 00:09:07.749]  They throw stuff in your face, they punch you, they break your fingers, they break your nail.
[00:09:07.749 --> 00:09:08.429]  They go after you.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.721]  And that ties into this story, that I was just mentioning.
[00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:17.284]  Leftists who wanted to kill first responders, now with an arsenal of explosives, hated Trump.
[00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:22.626]  It was part of Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter.
[00:09:22.626 --> 00:09:28.789]  Leftists panic over the possibility of having to spend Thanksgiving with Trump's supporting family.
[00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:30.710]  Well, I mean, you guys don't want families anyway.
[00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.471]  As you said, the nuclear family is bad and evil.
[00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:39.655]  So how about, how about people this Thanksgiving don't cater to their mentally ill leftist family?
[00:09:41.325 --> 00:09:43.147]  I mean, just don't invite them.
[00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:45.309]  Let them go have the government as their family.
[00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:47.452]  Let them go out.
[00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:48.493]  Quit catering to them.
[00:09:48.493 --> 00:09:49.214]  Here's another one.
[00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:52.618]  Coming soon to Washington, anti-Trump hotel for liberals.
[00:09:54.246 --> 00:10:03.468]  And it offers all these big jumbotron TVs about how wonderful liberals are and how great Obama and Hillary are and how terrible conservatives are.
[00:10:03.468 --> 00:10:07.969]  And then there's just, I guess, like flashing screens of Republicans and Nazi symbols everywhere.
[00:10:07.969 --> 00:10:14.170]  So it's kind of like a re-education camp mental patient center for folks that want to be immersed in the lies.
[00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.310]  That's out of Bloomberg.
[00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:23.632]  And that's what Apple and Google and Facebook and Twitter are all building their own little mini mentally ill cities where everybody that
[00:10:24.508 --> 00:10:43.292]  Drinks the Globalist Kool-Aid can go live in a literal re-education camp where there's flashing screens everywhere telling you you're a winner, feeding your dopamine rush that you're taking over America, that you're going to break up those families, that you're going to sexualize children, you're going to stop the effing white males even though effing white males run your world.
[00:10:45.694 --> 00:10:50.375]  That's what they're building, is little artificial bubble cities.
[00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:51.376]  That's where this is going.
[00:10:51.376 --> 00:11:02.959]  Twitter, Facebook, Google, Bezos has announced he's building bubble cities where they're neighborhoods with glass enclosures where you only go in those cities and the doors open for you.
[00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:05.819]  You need to feel powerful that nobody else can come in.
[00:11:05.819 --> 00:11:07.840]  You just built your own elite walled city.
[00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:17.884]  Where the SJW, mainly white people, can live, calling everyone outside the bubbles racist.
[00:11:17.884 --> 00:11:19.645]  I'm not joking.
[00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:21.105]  Bill Gates is building them too.
[00:11:21.105 --> 00:11:22.326]  This is the future.
[00:11:22.326 --> 00:11:27.528]  And then you'll pay for the exclusivity of being in the bubble.
[00:11:27.528 --> 00:11:28.628]  These are true bubble children.
[00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.472]  So we have that theme developing here today.
[00:11:33.472 --> 00:11:40.175]  You want to see actual schematics of the bubble cities, just type in Google announces self-contained neighborhoods.
[00:11:40.175 --> 00:11:45.818]  And then you look, it's, they're not so much bubbles because they're, they're, they're square and then connect and some are bubbles.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:12:09.980]  Of course, you'll be forced into these soon enough because the GMO is going to be so toxic and all this solar radiation making it through because they're frying the ozone layer with a chemtrailing and all the barium salts, aluminum dioxide is so poisoning the soil that you'll have to go indoors soon to grow things so we can kind of see their plan taking shape, making the outside so horrible.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:20.649]  That we're again forced into the bubble cities that were promoted by the New York Times, the UN, and the zeitgeist, communist utopia.
[00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:28.276]  And the leader, Peter Joseph, with his fake name, came on the show and said, if you refuse to go to the bubble city, you will be reeducated.
[00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:34.814]  And a few years later, we asked him back on, he said, I never said you'll be forced to re-education even though we have the tape.
[00:12:34.814 --> 00:12:36.675]  And I said, Peter, we do have the tape.
[00:12:36.675 --> 00:12:39.497]  He says, you do not have the tape.
[00:12:39.497 --> 00:12:40.237]  You do not.
[00:12:40.237 --> 00:12:43.119]  And say it doesn't exist and we will be friends.
[00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:46.560]  On the phone, I'm like, dude, I'm not your cult.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.543]  He talked just like the so-called industrialist that's taken over the world in
[00:12:52.403 --> 00:12:57.007]  And the new Blade Runner, he literally talks with that same effected, I am in control now.
[00:12:57.007 --> 00:13:00.049]  You will live in a bubble city.
[00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:02.591]  Robots will run everything for you.
[00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:05.574]  They will tell you what to do and decide what you will be.
[00:13:05.574 --> 00:13:07.115]  It is total freedom.
[00:13:07.115 --> 00:13:11.519]  I said, who programs the mainframe computer that controls our life?
[00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.480]  That was not to be discussed.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.521]  You will be reeducated.
[00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:15.702]  Don't ask that question.
[00:13:15.702 --> 00:13:20.226]  Well, intellectually, if we're all controlled by robots, who programs the robots?
[00:13:21.308 --> 00:13:22.449]  We will not discuss that.
[00:13:22.449 --> 00:13:23.189]  It will be free.
[00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:28.972]  It will be freedom, whoever programs the robots.
[00:13:28.972 --> 00:13:32.073]  Total wannabe NPR.
[00:13:32.073 --> 00:13:33.094]  I am in control.
[00:13:33.094 --> 00:13:37.916]  There is no reason for you to resist me.
[00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:40.658]  Things will go quite nicely once you have entered in.
[00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:44.450]  There is no need to resist.
[00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.212]  I am a friend.
[00:13:46.212 --> 00:13:52.478]  Simply providing resources that are needed by humanity.
[00:13:52.478 --> 00:13:57.283]  Give up your individuality and you will find happiness.
[00:13:57.283 --> 00:14:00.986]  Just look at the Davos Crips report this year.
[00:14:00.986 --> 00:14:02.988]  You have no privacy.
[00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:04.190]  You own nothing.
[00:14:05.376 --> 00:14:09.899]  You have no friends and you've never been happier.
[00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:16.722]  Aren't you happy now with the robots talking to you in the Bubble City?
[00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:20.044]  They tell you when you can go out of town.
[00:14:20.044 --> 00:14:23.306]  They tell you when you could visit family.
[00:14:23.306 --> 00:14:28.849]  They tell you what you're going to eat and who your most compatible friends are.
[00:14:28.849 --> 00:14:32.051]  This is a wonderful new world.
[00:14:32.952 --> 00:14:35.155]  Welcome to 2030.
[00:14:35.155 --> 00:14:40.622]  I own nothing, have no privacy, and life has never been better.
[00:14:40.622 --> 00:14:47.892]  My husband, my wife, those are words we cannot use.
[00:14:49.227 --> 00:14:51.108]  I have friends.
[00:14:51.108 --> 00:14:52.929]  I have friends.
[00:14:52.929 --> 00:14:55.190]  Friends I talk to.
[00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.252]  They're not machines.
[00:14:57.252 --> 00:15:00.453]  I identify them as human.
[00:15:00.453 --> 00:15:03.995]  You will be censured or fined if you not agree with me.
[00:15:03.995 --> 00:15:12.720]  If I identify as being a blind person, taxpayers will pay for me to be blinded, then you will take care of me.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.683]  If I am a white male that identifies as a Filipino female,
[00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:19.269]  You will accept it.
[00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:24.651]  If you do not accept my madness, you will be arrested.
[00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:28.712]  This is all for the better.
[00:15:28.712 --> 00:15:34.613]  I gave up my consciousness to merge with the machine to live forever.
[00:15:34.613 --> 00:15:40.034]  When this body dies, I will live on in new bodies.
[00:15:40.034 --> 00:15:41.535]  Of course, that's all a lie.
[00:15:41.535 --> 00:15:45.936]  I'm now just a biological android, not even a cyborg.
[00:15:47.352 --> 00:15:52.282]  Jeff Bezos, Zuckerberg, they will be men though.
[00:15:52.282 --> 00:15:54.566]  They will not take on the interface.
[00:15:54.566 --> 00:15:55.568]  We call them master.
[00:15:59.471 --> 00:16:00.931]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.

[00:18:07.499 --> 00:18:15.902]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:15.902 --> 00:18:20.783]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:20.783 --> 00:18:24.164]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee
[00:18:25.725 --> 00:18:26.446]  We're good to go.
[00:18:49.668 --> 00:18:56.013]  I want to plow into all of this that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:18.330]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.452]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:24.455]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:25.656]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[00:19:25.896 --> 00:19:31.700]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.082]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:19:34.082 --> 00:19:36.723]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:19:36.723 --> 00:19:39.525]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:42.007]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:42.007 --> 00:19:51.193]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:19:51.193 --> 00:19:55.636]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.717]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:23.569]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:20:23.569 --> 00:20:25.172]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:20:54.292 --> 00:21:06.195]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up... The accelerated breakup of the EU is now happening as five nations refuse to let the EU army come in and occupy them.
[00:21:06.195 --> 00:21:07.835]  Oh, countries want to leave the EU?
[00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:12.957]  We have the secret army we've been building for five years, six years, and it's just now going to roll in.
[00:21:12.957 --> 00:21:14.797]  And people are like, no you're not.
[00:21:14.797 --> 00:21:22.119]  So it's accelerating the breakup as they become completely, not just authoritarian, but military conquest.
[00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:22.859]  That's coming up.
[00:21:23.888 --> 00:21:32.412]  We've got accelerated Democrat professors and others, pundits, talk show hosts, TV hosts, mainstream anchors.
[00:21:32.412 --> 00:21:46.279]  Every day I see seven or eight articles with different prominent people saying whites are inherently evil, need to be exterminated, need to not have any babies, are the reason there's problems, you're inherently evil.
[00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:48.180]  The left has gone completely Nazi.
[00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:53.254]  And it's mainly white people leading it, saying whites are inherently evil.
[00:21:53.254 --> 00:21:55.518]  This is truly a mentally ill group of people.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.622]  Trying to double down on their insanity.
[00:21:59.622 --> 00:22:08.528]  But first, I want to play Attorney General Jeff Sessions opening speech today when he was there to testify about just the Justice Department in general.
[00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:26.420]  It soon turned into a fiasco with Nadler and others going, you got caught lying about Papadopoulos and what he said in some meeting where Papadopoulos testified, he vaguely in some meeting mentioned, hey, I might travel to Russia and reach out when he was just some unpaid person of dozens and dozens that came through.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.422]  And Sessions says, yeah, now that I read about the paper, I guess he might have said that at the meeting.
[00:22:31.422 --> 00:22:32.882]  And they're like, oh, we got you!
[00:22:32.882 --> 00:22:34.583]  You're a liar!
[00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:39.845]  While they're the ones up to their eyeballs with uranium and secret meetings and illegal servers.
[00:22:39.845 --> 00:22:41.025]  It just goes on and on.
[00:22:41.025 --> 00:22:42.286]  So here is his opening testimony.
[00:22:43.302 --> 00:22:47.727]  I would like to address the false charges made about my previous testimony.
[00:22:47.727 --> 00:22:49.689]  My answers have not changed.
[00:22:49.689 --> 00:22:59.360]  I've always told the truth and I have answered every question as I understood them to the best of my recollection as I will continue to do today.
[00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:09.884]  I would like to address recent news reports regarding meetings during the campaign attended by George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, among others.
[00:23:09.884 --> 00:23:16.087]  Frankly, I had no recollection of this meeting until I saw these news reports.
[00:23:16.087 --> 00:23:29.313]  I do now recall that the March 2016 meeting at the Trump Hotel that Mr. Papadopoulos attended, but I have no clear recollection of the details of what he said at that meeting.
[00:23:29.953 --> 00:23:44.089]  After reading his account, and to the best of my recollection, I believe that I wanted to make clear to him that he was not authorized to represent the campaign with the Russian government or any other foreign government for that matter.
[00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:50.655]  But I did not recall this event, which occurred 18 months before my testimony of a few weeks ago.
[00:23:50.655 --> 00:24:01.585]  And I would gladly have reported it, had I remembered it, because I pushed back against his suggestion that I thought may have been improper.
[00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:17.798]  As for Mr. Page, while I do not challenge his recollection, I have no memory of his presence at a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club or any passing conversation he may have had with me as he left the dinner.
[00:24:17.798 --> 00:24:28.927]  All you have been in campaigns, let me just suggest, but most of you have not participated in a presidential campaign, and none of you had a part in the Trump campaign.
[00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:34.758]  And it was a brilliant campaign, I think, in many ways.
[00:24:34.758 --> 00:24:39.300]  But it was a form of chaos every day from day one.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.141]  We traveled sometimes to several places in one day.
[00:24:43.141 --> 00:24:45.222]  Sleep was in short supply.
[00:24:45.222 --> 00:24:49.904]  And I was still a full-time senator with a very full schedule.
[00:24:49.904 --> 00:24:54.666]  During this year, I've spent close to 20 hours testifying before Congress.
[00:24:55.666 --> 00:25:07.230]  Before today, I have been asked to remember details from a year ago, such as who I saw on what day, in what meeting, and who said what to when.
[00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:16.553]  In all of my testimony, I can only do my best to answer your questions as I understand them and to the best of my memory.
[00:25:16.553 --> 00:25:23.095]  But I will not accept and reject accusations that I have ever lied.
[00:25:23.095 --> 00:25:23.815]  That is a lie.
[00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:26.480]  Let me be clear.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:38.386]  I have at all times conducted myself honorably and in a manner consistent with the high standards and responsibilities of the Office of Attorney General, which I revere.
[00:25:38.386 --> 00:25:41.547]  I spent 15 years in that department.
[00:25:41.547 --> 00:25:43.408]  I love that department.
[00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:49.672]  I honor that department and will do my dead level best to be worthy of your Attorney General.
[00:25:50.652 --> 00:25:53.836]  So as I said before, my story has never changed.
[00:25:53.836 --> 00:26:01.566]  I've always told the truth, and I've answered every question to the best of my recollection, and I will continue to do so today.
[00:26:01.566 --> 00:26:04.370]  With that, Mr. Chairman, I'm honored to take your questions.
[00:26:05.273 --> 00:26:22.556]  Now, when you remember that it's the Clintons in bed with the Russians, hundreds of millions of dollars we now earn, Mueller on tarmacs with bag men with weapons-grade uranium, Mueller in ten companies at least where he invests no money but gets millions back, totally illegal, declaring none of this.
[00:26:23.638 --> 00:26:26.279]  Just involved in stuff that is over the top.
[00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:31.281]  Communist Chinese, sold out to the Islamists, sold out to Saudi Arabia.
[00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:35.242]  I mean, Mueller's a literal bag man for the Clintons.
[00:26:35.242 --> 00:26:39.723]  Killed investigations the FBI had into Uranium One, allowed it to go forward with Congress.
[00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:42.204]  This was all in the news years ago.
[00:26:42.204 --> 00:26:47.686]  And then they got Sessions going, well, we caught you when you were senator last year.
[00:26:47.686 --> 00:26:49.727]  You met with the Russian ambassador twice.
[00:26:49.727 --> 00:26:50.667]  He said, yeah, I said that.
[00:26:51.496 --> 00:26:54.537]  That's what you do when you're ahead of a committee.
[00:26:54.537 --> 00:26:57.019]  Pelosi met with him 30-something times.
[00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:58.059]  They come by your office.
[00:26:58.059 --> 00:26:58.779]  What they do?
[00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:01.220]  Constituents come by your office.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:08.124]  And again, they prey on the public, not knowing how this stuff works, to just keep acting like there's something going on there.
[00:27:09.363 --> 00:27:10.664]  You know, Donald Jr.
[00:27:10.664 --> 00:27:14.246]  tried to find dirt on Hillary, that means he's a Russian agent, or Donald Jr.
[00:27:14.246 --> 00:27:16.087]  tried to get dirt from WikiLeaks.
[00:27:16.087 --> 00:27:21.870]  Yeah, I sent WikiLeaks a bunch of emails, my producers saying, please come on, please give us the emails.
[00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.831]  That's what the news did.
[00:27:23.831 --> 00:27:26.692]  They take normal behavior and turn it into something bad.
[00:27:26.692 --> 00:27:36.477]  But just a few minutes ago I saw this montage with Fox News even acting like they had just caught Sessions doing something.
[00:27:36.477 --> 00:27:37.098]  I mean, that's how
[00:27:38.231 --> 00:27:44.374]  Crazy it is, and you watch the Senators all staring at Sessions like he's done something terrible in the hearing.
[00:27:44.374 --> 00:27:46.215]  It is just crazy.
[00:27:46.215 --> 00:27:48.757]  Absolutely crazy, because they're running scared.
[00:27:48.757 --> 00:27:49.777]  They're the ones that did it.
[00:27:49.777 --> 00:27:50.798]  Let's play part of that clip.
[00:27:53.126 --> 00:27:53.586]  Uh-huh.
[00:28:13.453 --> 00:28:21.158]  And another foreign policy aide, Carter Page, told House investigators he had mentioned to Sessions he was taking a trip to Moscow.
[00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:30.123]  Sessions saying in his opening statements he always told the truth in the past and that he answered questions as best as he understood them at that time.
[00:28:30.123 --> 00:28:32.664]  The lawmakers with plenty of new questions for him today.
[00:28:34.735 --> 00:28:37.878]  We're going to go to those because, again, you heard him.
[00:28:37.878 --> 00:28:39.720]  Ooh, he got caught.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:45.367]  And you read the FBI affidavit and the indictment and stuff of Manafort and others.
[00:28:45.367 --> 00:28:48.490]  It's all Papanopoulos keeps coming in and saying, hey, meet with the Russians.
[00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.192]  Like, get out of here.
[00:28:50.192 --> 00:28:51.013]  Clearly a setup.
[00:28:51.013 --> 00:28:52.594]  I mean, it's so pathetic.
[00:28:52.594 --> 00:28:53.856]  There's nothing there.
[00:28:53.856 --> 00:28:54.717]  They're so desperate.
[00:28:57.313 --> 00:29:00.654]  Hey, Daniel Brinkman, why Numana Storable Foods?
[00:29:00.654 --> 00:29:02.015]  We believe in freedom.

[00:29:05.416 --> 00:29:06.956]  And we take this charge seriously.
[00:29:06.956 --> 00:29:07.997]  We got options.

[00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:46.492]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[00:32:46.492 --> 00:32:47.612]  It is an act of war.
[00:32:47.612 --> 00:32:49.694]  It is an act of standing up.
[00:32:49.694 --> 00:32:55.238]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[00:33:01.019 --> 00:33:09.672]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:09.672 --> 00:33:14.719]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:38.562 --> 00:33:41.704]  Let's try and correct the earlier testimony now for the record.
[00:33:41.704 --> 00:33:48.647]  Yes or no, did you chair the March 31st 2016 meeting of the National Security Advisory Committee?
[00:33:48.647 --> 00:33:51.429]  I did chair that meeting.
[00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:55.231]  Did Mr. Papadopoulos mention his outreach to the Russian government during that meeting?
[00:33:55.231 --> 00:34:01.634]  He made some comment to that effect, as I remember after having read it in the newspaper.
[00:34:02.194 --> 00:34:04.436]  I asked for yes or no, I don't have time.
[00:34:04.436 --> 00:34:06.737]  I cannot imagine your memory would fail you so much.
[00:34:06.737 --> 00:34:15.303]  But moving on, do you want to admit under oath that you did not tell the truth or misrepresented, or do you want to correct your testimony right now?
[00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:24.431]  So, did he clarify those previous comments that he made under oath, Jonah?
[00:34:24.431 --> 00:34:27.432]  I'm sure the Democrats will think not.
[00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:29.633]  I think that his supporters will think probably.
[00:34:29.633 --> 00:34:32.834]  I'm sort of in the gray area about all this.
[00:34:32.834 --> 00:34:35.155]  I think he got himself into some trouble way back when.
[00:34:35.155 --> 00:34:36.355]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:34:37.332 --> 00:34:38.973]  You want to know why I'm playing clips of Fox News?
[00:34:38.973 --> 00:34:40.114]  I can just play this off C-SPAN.
[00:34:40.114 --> 00:34:41.455]  We have the clips.
[00:34:41.455 --> 00:34:45.518]  I'm doing it so you can see even Fox News.
[00:34:45.518 --> 00:34:47.780]  Last segment I played, the lady intro it.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.182]  I came back into this segment, showed how they outroed it.
[00:34:51.182 --> 00:34:56.506]  And it just went on and on, acting like Sessions has done something bad.
[00:34:56.506 --> 00:35:00.569]  And then almost no coverage, even on Fox, of Uranium One.
[00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:13.273]  Of Mueller the bag man, of all the companies Mueller's in, of all the calls for Trump to have the Attorney General create a special prosecutor for the Clintons, for Mueller.
[00:35:13.273 --> 00:35:14.713]  That is the answer.
[00:35:14.713 --> 00:35:26.736]  We have them open and shut, but they knew how to start the investigation first to make it look like if Trump retaliated, he'd retaliated for political purposes, not for justice.
[00:35:28.999 --> 00:35:30.600]  Everybody played Mr. Nice Guy.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:41.488]  I told President-elect Trump, and I told Trump when he was president, I said, Mr. President, they're going to tell you they're going to make deals and back off and stop what they've done.
[00:35:41.488 --> 00:35:45.811]  They're never going to stop until you're destroyed because of what you stand for.
[00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:56.759]  And if you don't start prosecuting them day one for the crimes they've committed, they are never going to rest until they have overthrown you and the American people and the electoral process.
[00:35:56.759 --> 00:35:58.160]  I said, sir, they're already talking.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:14.093]  About having new elections and suspending the last election that elected you and getting rid of the members of Congress that are Republican who just got elected and having Homeland Security run the elections and totally federalize it because Obama had just signed that executive order when Trump was president-elect.
[00:36:14.093 --> 00:36:15.114]  He said, I know about that.
[00:36:15.114 --> 00:36:16.515]  I know about that.
[00:36:16.515 --> 00:36:17.336]  We're looking into it.
[00:36:17.336 --> 00:36:19.858]  And he goes, yeah, all the illegals voting.
[00:36:19.858 --> 00:36:20.698]  It's incredible.
[00:36:20.698 --> 00:36:21.920]  And dead people.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.661]  It's incredible what the experts tell me.
[00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:27.044]  And I said, sir, I'm not talking about the illegals voting.
[00:36:28.658 --> 00:36:36.545]  Obama signed an executive order to federalize all 50 states elections.
[00:36:36.545 --> 00:36:43.952]  At that time, 15 attorney generals had written letters to Trump, President-elect, and to Obama.
[00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:47.575]  Later it was unanimous, a month later, saying, please reverse this.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:57.567]  All 50 attorney generals have said this is the end of the federalist system and a total federal takeover of the elections like Venezuela.
[00:36:57.567 --> 00:37:01.614]  And I was the first to raise the alarm just because I'm not stupid.
[00:37:01.614 --> 00:37:03.717]  I saw the executive order.
[00:37:03.717 --> 00:37:04.798]  We just put it on screen.
[00:37:06.616 --> 00:37:22.562]  Then Obama did another executive order, establishing a Ministry of Truth, saying that Infowars, Breitbart, and conservative media is Russian, and directing the Central Intelligence Agency to counter us by any means necessary.
[00:37:22.562 --> 00:37:25.903]  You can go read the executive order he signed.
[00:37:25.903 --> 00:37:31.005]  And by the way, that was an executive order that accompanied the bill he signed in the Defense Authorization Act for 2017.
[00:37:34.912 --> 00:37:39.554]  And it says they will use the CIA on me to stop me.
[00:37:39.554 --> 00:37:47.017]  And then you watch Congress a week and a half ago and they said, Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars has a story about a Muslim attacking.
[00:37:47.017 --> 00:37:50.139]  It's fake news.
[00:37:50.139 --> 00:37:51.940]  What are you going to do?
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:56.142]  And the heads of Twitter, Facebook, and Google say, we stopped him at lunch, sir.
[00:37:56.142 --> 00:37:58.042]  And Congress quickly went, good.
[00:37:58.042 --> 00:37:59.803]  How do you stop him, period, for being on there?
[00:37:59.803 --> 00:38:01.364]  And he goes, sir, we're trying.
[00:38:04.966 --> 00:38:07.507]  I mean, you saw them sign it, you saw them do it.
[00:38:07.507 --> 00:38:08.887]  I'm not being melodramatic.
[00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:12.688]  In fact, I don't know how to be dramatic enough about this situation.
[00:38:12.688 --> 00:38:31.292]  The articles I've got in front of me, when you deal with Stockholm Syndrome, when you deal with cuckolding, when you deal with people wanting to go under trauma and wanting to be conquered and wanting to do anything, they're having Islamic attacks, stabbings, shootings, and rapes every day in Sweden.
[00:38:31.292 --> 00:38:34.513]  This story's by Kit Daniels on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:35.512 --> 00:38:36.753]  One of scores I've got.
[00:38:36.753 --> 00:38:42.695]  Let's roll that footage from Mall of America the day of the stabbing two days ago.
[00:38:42.695 --> 00:38:46.516]  Folks caught a Somali guy robbing them while they were in the dressing room.
[00:38:46.516 --> 00:38:47.417]  They called for help.
[00:38:47.417 --> 00:38:50.778]  He stabbed them both.
[00:38:50.778 --> 00:38:54.700]  Sweetened under pressure to adopt Islamic national flag.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:59.401]  Country known for appeasing Muslims in every possible way.
[00:38:59.401 --> 00:39:00.522]  Now, I'm not joking.
[00:39:02.028 --> 00:39:08.310]  They have UN ads that run in Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and France, we played that show.
[00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:19.033]  Super hot sex models, sex symbols, dancing with hijabs on and then covering their face saying it's sexy to wear hijab.
[00:39:19.033 --> 00:39:23.334]  You have TV ads this Christmas saying celebrate Islam.
[00:39:23.334 --> 00:39:24.814]  It's all happening.
[00:39:24.814 --> 00:39:27.155]  You're seeing footage of Mall of America this weekend.
[00:39:30.436 --> 00:39:34.038]  Sweden under pressure to adopt Islamic national flag.
[00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.198]  This is no joke.
[00:39:35.198 --> 00:39:37.039]  Infowars.com.
[00:39:37.039 --> 00:39:39.100]  Newswars.com.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.022]  Country known for appeasing Muslims in every possible way.
[00:39:42.022 --> 00:39:45.964]  And they've got a Somali guy right here in the middle that leads the group.
[00:39:45.964 --> 00:39:52.227]  A social media campaign is pressuring Sweden to adopt the Turkish style flag due to Islam's rapid growth in the country.
[00:39:52.227 --> 00:39:59.691]  A petition asking Sweden's Prime Minister to do away with the current offensive flag is nearing its signature, because it has a cross on it.
[00:40:01.056 --> 00:40:05.782]  As the campaign hashtag for better Sweden continues to trend on Twitter.
[00:40:05.782 --> 00:40:09.707]  The Swedish flag is consistent reminder of a dark and oppressive past.
[00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:12.610]  That sounds like the Pope this year saying Christianity is bad.
[00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:17.616]  The petition reads refugees and migrants are forces to live under its Christian cross.
[00:40:19.136 --> 00:40:26.222]  A symbol of the Crusades and the slaughter of millions of innocent Islamic lives in Sweden's past that makes them feel unwelcome and unsafe.
[00:40:26.222 --> 00:40:27.483]  Hey, Muslims!
[00:40:27.483 --> 00:40:28.805]  You started it!
[00:40:28.805 --> 00:40:30.226]  You started your Jihad.
[00:40:30.226 --> 00:40:32.448]  You invaded Europe for 200 years.
[00:40:32.448 --> 00:40:33.889]  You ran over Eastern Europe.
[00:40:33.889 --> 00:40:38.133]  It's why people have dark hair and Asian-atic eyes.
[00:40:39.614 --> 00:40:40.535]  Okay?
[00:40:40.535 --> 00:40:41.355]  That's a fact.
[00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:42.936]  They ran over Poland.
[00:40:42.936 --> 00:40:44.177]  They ran over Hungary.
[00:40:44.177 --> 00:40:50.962]  They ran over... They ran all the way up to the eastern borders of Germany and France.
[00:40:50.962 --> 00:40:52.803]  They took Spain.
[00:40:52.803 --> 00:40:57.887]  Everywhere but northern Spain.
[00:40:57.887 --> 00:40:58.367]  Oh!
[00:40:58.367 --> 00:40:59.268]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[00:40:59.268 --> 00:41:00.309]  We're going to cover this when we come back.
[00:41:01.846 --> 00:41:07.467]  CNN has a story about slave blocks where they sell women and men up on blocks.
[00:41:07.467 --> 00:41:17.349]  I've told you this for years in Sudan, in Somalia, and now in Libya since it got liberated by the forces of the Arab Spring that Google and everybody supported and Bezos supported.
[00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:23.850]  They are now selling men on an auction block saying they're good workers.
[00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:30.511]  They'll do a good job for you and that's they're being sold by Islamic State and
[00:41:32.073 --> 00:41:35.495]  The reason they look happy is they kill you if no one buys you.
[00:41:35.495 --> 00:41:39.597]  These are just men being sold because Africans aren't seen as human under Islam.
[00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:40.797]  That's why the blacks all joined it.
[00:41:40.797 --> 00:41:41.318]  I don't know why.
[00:41:41.318 --> 00:41:42.098]  I'm not kidding.
[00:41:42.098 --> 00:41:43.719]  It actually says in the Quran you're not human.
[00:41:43.719 --> 00:41:45.460]  It calls black folks all with racist names.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.521]  I won't say it on air.
[00:41:47.521 --> 00:41:50.342]  The modern slave trade was started by Arabs.
[00:41:50.342 --> 00:41:53.324]  And they would have slave galleys they used with Europeans they grabbed.
[00:41:55.205 --> 00:41:57.026]  And so all over there they're selling women.
[00:41:57.026 --> 00:42:02.508]  Now remember, The Daily Show and others made fun of me a few months ago when I said slave blocks.
[00:42:02.508 --> 00:42:04.048]  They sell women on slave blocks.
[00:42:04.048 --> 00:42:06.409]  They go, what's a slave block?
[00:42:06.409 --> 00:42:10.191]  See, Islam's all about slavery of men, women, and children.
[00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:12.952]  Islam is about sex with men and boys.
[00:42:12.952 --> 00:42:14.413]  Islam is that.
[00:42:14.413 --> 00:42:15.913]  Islam is that.
[00:42:15.913 --> 00:42:17.874]  Islam is why the left loves it.
[00:42:19.878 --> 00:42:25.030]  Because it's anti-human, anti-God, oppressive in its orthodox, obvious form.
[00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.836]  There are seven countries in Islam where slavery is still legal.
[00:42:29.943 --> 00:42:32.605]  Why didn't Trump just ban people from countries that have slavery legal?
[00:42:32.605 --> 00:42:49.015]  But oh, we gotta hear about America and slavery all day, you see, to cover up for what's really going on, and then tell Sweden, you better take the Islamic flag because of what you did to us poor Muslims when we invaded and got stopped on the borders of Sweden!
[00:42:49.015 --> 00:42:51.077]  And got stopped on the borders of Germany!
[00:42:51.077 --> 00:42:52.277]  And got stopped!
[00:42:52.277 --> 00:42:53.358]  Got stopped!
[00:42:53.358 --> 00:42:54.439]  Got stopped!
[00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:55.339]  Got stopped!
[00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:56.860]  And we're gonna stop you again!
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.561]  You understand?! !
[00:43:01.198 --> 00:43:02.759]  We're running the biggest specials.
[00:43:02.759 --> 00:43:07.742]  We run them like six months and free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:07.742 --> 00:43:12.125]  And when we sell products at this lower price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[00:43:12.125 --> 00:43:17.469]  But I know the products are so good, that even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more.
[00:43:17.469 --> 00:43:25.534]  Especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash, or our vitamin mineral fusion, the fruit punch drink.
[00:43:25.534 --> 00:43:28.236]  It's got all the amino acids and multivitamins.
[00:43:28.236 --> 00:43:29.537]  Our probiotic.
[00:43:29.537 --> 00:43:30.037]  All of it.
[00:43:30.037 --> 00:43:31.038]  Super Mel Vitality.
[00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:33.780]  50% off, never done that, and free shipping.
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.520]  Boom.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.282]  Super Filmo Vitality, 50% off, with free shipping.
[00:43:37.282 --> 00:43:37.822]  Boom.
[00:43:37.822 --> 00:43:40.524]  Bomb Defense, 50% off, with free shipping.
[00:43:40.524 --> 00:43:42.725]  With the free shipping, folks, it's a lost leader.
[00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:46.207]  You sign up for auto ship, we're losing like six, seven dollars on this.
[00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:48.249]  Doesn't matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[00:43:48.249 --> 00:43:54.593]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[00:43:57.378 --> 00:44:05.631]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:06.852]  A 360 win.
[00:44:06.852 --> 00:44:13.122]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[00:44:13.402 --> 00:44:21.323]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:44:21.323 --> 00:44:26.424]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:44:26.424 --> 00:44:32.505]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:44:32.505 --> 00:44:40.307]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:44:40.307 --> 00:44:42.087]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win
[00:44:42.927 --> 00:44:47.172]  And with the new AutoShip feature at Infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:44:47.172 --> 00:44:48.473]  10% off on AutoShip.
[00:44:48.473 --> 00:44:50.916]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:44:50.916 --> 00:44:52.918]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:44:52.918 --> 00:44:56.742]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:44:58.194 --> 00:45:02.838]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[00:45:02.838 --> 00:45:10.483]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.

[00:45:27.456 --> 00:45:37.824]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:45:37.824 --> 00:45:44.630]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:47.212]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[00:45:47.472 --> 00:45:51.095]  Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride free products.
[00:45:51.095 --> 00:45:55.718]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:47:00.514 --> 00:47:03.155]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.984 --> 00:47:24.825]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:24.825 --> 00:47:29.128]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:29.128 --> 00:47:33.091]  Infowars.com is our main site.
[00:47:33.091 --> 00:47:35.552]  And don't forget, we've got all the other great broadcasts as well.
[00:47:53.453 --> 00:47:55.634]  We are broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:55.634 --> 00:47:56.975]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:47:56.975 --> 00:47:58.195]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:47:58.195 --> 00:48:02.437]  The news site's Infowars.com.
[00:48:02.437 --> 00:48:04.198]  The globalists have made the decision.
[00:48:04.198 --> 00:48:05.019]  It's official.
[00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:06.799]  The head of the EU has said it.
[00:48:06.799 --> 00:48:07.760]  Juncker has said it.
[00:48:09.076 --> 00:48:10.336]  Peter Sutherland has said it.
[00:48:10.336 --> 00:48:13.317]  They're going to conquer Europe with Islam.
[00:48:13.317 --> 00:48:15.278]  There are a billion and a half Muslims.
[00:48:15.278 --> 00:48:17.398]  Most of them are right there next to Europe.
[00:48:17.398 --> 00:48:22.599]  There's going to be three billion total by 2025, maybe even earlier.
[00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:26.901]  Their numbers are doubling exponentially every few years.
[00:48:26.901 --> 00:48:30.141]  And the decision has been made to Islamify Europe.
[00:48:30.141 --> 00:48:36.523]  And when people would raise the alarm, they would be criticized, they would be attacked, they would be demonized.
[00:48:38.547 --> 00:48:40.308]  Well, here's just the articles today.
[00:48:40.308 --> 00:48:52.875]  Officially, they're pushing to change the flag from the cross, that the Muslims say is offensive, to the Islamic flag, basically, of Turkey.
[00:48:52.875 --> 00:49:00.739]  And I guess it was Muslims that conquered what is Turkey today, when it was Constantinople, and put all the men to death, and then enslaved the people.
[00:49:00.739 --> 00:49:02.180]  So I guess it's kind of okay.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.202]  Because after all, Turkey was Christian.
[00:49:06.503 --> 00:49:13.988]  And Istanbul was Christian, it's now, well it was Constantinople, it's now Istanbul.
[00:49:13.988 --> 00:49:23.155]  And it just really blows my mind to see this type of stuff going on and to just be witnessing it happening in mass.
[00:49:24.847 --> 00:49:26.128]  It really is happening.
[00:49:26.128 --> 00:49:28.069]  It really is going on.
[00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:48.184]  And then to watch mainstream media, the major universities, Hollywood, demonize Christianity, demonize the West, that ended slavery, that started the process and then ended it, except in areas of Africa and the Middle East and other Muslim-dominated areas, where slavery is still the law of the land in at least seven countries, Sudan,
[00:49:50.091 --> 00:49:58.877]  Somalia, and now recently liberated by the globalists, liberated, the Islamic State-controlled Libya.
[00:49:58.877 --> 00:50:06.503]  And so CNN, though, has all these big articles and all these big discussions about slavery discovered in Libya.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:15.243]  But then they never tell you it's Islamic doing it, or that it's okay in the Quran, or this is a culture pushing it.
[00:50:15.243 --> 00:50:17.664]  They just say, look how terrible slavery is.
[00:50:17.664 --> 00:50:21.846]  Who are the people selling these African men?
[00:50:21.846 --> 00:50:25.448]  And of course, it was really the Guardian and everybody else that broke this years ago.
[00:50:25.448 --> 00:50:28.809]  They sell women up on slave blocks.
[00:50:28.809 --> 00:50:30.630]  They sell women up on blocks.
[00:50:34.172 --> 00:50:37.194]  And there's news articles about it, but none of our media will pick it up.
[00:50:37.194 --> 00:50:41.856]  Well, finally, CNN's covering it, but never telling you it's Islamic.
[00:50:41.856 --> 00:50:48.440]  In big, long articles, in big, long news reports, in big, long videos, they won't tell you, this is Islam.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:53.562]  This is the countries where slavery's still legal.
[00:50:53.562 --> 00:50:54.603]  No.
[00:50:54.603 --> 00:50:58.025]  They tell you America and the West is all guilty.
[00:50:59.076 --> 00:51:06.264]  There are Islamic invasions going on all over Northern Africa, Eastern Africa, right down into Central Africa.
[00:51:06.264 --> 00:51:17.636]  They are getting all the way into the Congo now, Islamicists, and have slave trades out of Niger, out of Ethiopia, out of all these once Christian areas, up into Tunisia.
[00:51:18.681 --> 00:51:34.449]  up into Libya and then up into major cities like Tripoli where the slaves are then sold to Islamic owners who take them to their slave plantations.
[00:51:34.449 --> 00:51:41.052]  Now still many others as these routes are opened up are then sold to aid agencies
[00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:43.646]  Who actually want the people.
[00:51:43.646 --> 00:51:47.268]  It was paying to have them kidnapped and brought a thousand miles.
[00:51:47.268 --> 00:51:53.712]  And then they're loaded onto ships, paid for by George Soros, and dumped in Europe.
[00:51:53.712 --> 00:52:01.216]  Once they're there, they get brought into Islamic centers, even though most of them aren't Muslims, and then wound up to be anti-American, anti-European.
[00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:04.623]  You cannot make this up.
[00:52:04.623 --> 00:52:22.762]  So, again, Islam is running slavery worldwide, and so every basketball player, every football player, who's black, has to ignorantly take on some name like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, because Islam fights for black people!
[00:52:22.762 --> 00:52:25.605]  Islam created the African slave trade.
[00:52:27.984 --> 00:52:32.148]  The slaves the Romans took were Germanic.
[00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:33.629]  They were next door to them.
[00:52:33.629 --> 00:52:35.011]  That's who they grabbed.
[00:52:35.011 --> 00:52:36.352]  That's who they wanted.
[00:52:36.352 --> 00:52:40.856]  That's who they used.
[00:52:40.856 --> 00:52:43.919]  Africans were rare in Greece.
[00:52:43.919 --> 00:52:47.042]  Rare in Rome.
[00:52:50.896 --> 00:52:58.701]  But you won't hear a word from Kaepernick about Arab slave traders running men, women, and children everywhere.
[00:52:58.701 --> 00:53:07.788]  Instead, he likes to be on the cover of establishment dying publications to look cool and act cool as a mindless SJW.
[00:53:07.788 --> 00:53:12.391]  And you're not going to hear a word out of him about real slavery because it's not fashionable.
[00:53:13.587 --> 00:53:20.732]  He's just here with the big corporate media as a rearguard action, a scorched earth policy of Hollywood to try to get America into a civil war.
[00:53:20.732 --> 00:53:24.035]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:53:24.035 --> 00:53:29.939]  But what CNN shows these men is nothing.
[00:53:29.939 --> 00:53:31.861]  So uncool to be on the cover of GQ.
[00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:32.721]  Super uncool.
[00:53:32.721 --> 00:53:34.062]  Look how stupid it is.
[00:53:34.062 --> 00:53:36.724]  Once you're not in the trance, it's like pathetic.
[00:53:36.724 --> 00:53:37.525]  It's like they live.
[00:53:41.633 --> 00:53:43.959]  Not going to hear a word about the African slave trade from them.
[00:53:43.959 --> 00:53:48.590]  Or if you do, if it gets forced out, they'll go, oh, and just never mention it's Islamic.
[00:53:50.339 --> 00:54:10.491]  Or never mention that Hillary and Obama overthrew Libya that was empowering all Africans and really doing a good job overall, who'd come into the West, was working with the West, wasn't supporting terror for 10 years, and overthrew them and let the most horrible Islamic slave traders in who sell little kids into sex slavery and kill every Christian they can get their hands on.
[00:54:10.491 --> 00:54:15.534]  Here's part of the CNN whitewash.
[00:54:15.534 --> 00:54:18.156]  This is Libya this year.
[00:54:19.935 --> 00:54:25.420]  A man addressing an unseen crowd.
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:29.603]  Big strong boys for farm work, he says.
[00:54:29.603 --> 00:54:33.166]  Four hundred.
[00:54:33.166 --> 00:54:37.850]  Seven hundred.
[00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:38.910]  Eight hundred.
[00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:40.632]  The numbers roll in.
[00:54:40.632 --> 00:54:44.275]  These men are sold for twelve hundred Libyan pounds.
[00:54:44.275 --> 00:54:45.516]  Four hundred dollars apiece.
[00:54:47.105 --> 00:54:51.709]  You are watching an auction of human beings.
[00:54:51.709 --> 00:54:54.252]  Another man, claiming to be a buyer.
[00:54:54.252 --> 00:54:57.515]  Off camera, someone asks, what happened to the ones from Niger?
[00:55:00.023 --> 00:55:02.245]  Sold off, he's told.
[00:55:02.245 --> 00:55:05.007]  CNN was sent this message by a contact.
[00:55:05.007 --> 00:55:06.609]  After months of work... Alright, let's stop there.
[00:55:06.609 --> 00:55:08.811]  Oh, after months of work at CNN.
[00:55:08.811 --> 00:55:09.612]  That is nothing.
[00:55:09.612 --> 00:55:15.977]  We've got the footage of them chopping people up and eating them, selling the women, raping them, stuff we can't even show you.
[00:55:15.977 --> 00:55:18.139]  And it's in the foreign press.
[00:55:18.139 --> 00:55:23.684]  But never is it discussed who's bringing these people out of Central Northern Africa.
[00:55:23.684 --> 00:55:26.767]  Most of them are animist, or they're Christians.
[00:55:27.912 --> 00:55:30.354]  They worship animals or they worship Christ.
[00:55:30.354 --> 00:55:34.857]  And they're being taken up into Libya to be sold.
[00:55:34.857 --> 00:55:36.898]  I mean, there's the BBC reporting on it.
[00:55:36.898 --> 00:55:41.261]  Humans are reportedly sold as slaves for 400 each on the front line of the migrant crisis.
[00:55:41.261 --> 00:55:43.062]  The migrant crisis?
[00:55:43.062 --> 00:55:47.245]  It's the Islamic crisis that Europe advertised these people to come north.
[00:55:49.397 --> 00:55:53.121]  By the way, if you're a TV viewer, you notice I'm wearing what I believe is the coolest InfoWars shirt ever.
[00:55:53.121 --> 00:55:55.063]  It's made of really good designer fabric.
[00:55:55.063 --> 00:55:56.925]  Super high quality.
[00:55:56.925 --> 00:55:59.728]  It is won't tread on me with a big Gadsden snake.
[00:55:59.728 --> 00:56:00.509]  Great design.
[00:56:00.509 --> 00:56:01.751]  InfoWars.com.
[00:56:01.751 --> 00:56:03.472]  The American flag on the right shoulder, on the back.
[00:56:04.454 --> 00:56:06.595]  It's got Infowars.com.
[00:56:06.595 --> 00:56:07.475]  I love this shirt.
[00:56:07.475 --> 00:56:09.676]  If you buy it, it helps fund our operation.
[00:56:09.676 --> 00:56:11.996]  Helps you meet like-minded people.
[00:56:11.996 --> 00:56:14.017]  Spread the word.
[00:56:14.017 --> 00:56:18.358]  Our apparel just gets better and better, and I think this is the best-looking shirt we've ever produced.
[00:56:18.358 --> 00:56:20.819]  I hope you'll go buy one today and help fund our operation.
[00:56:20.819 --> 00:56:22.940]  Again, it's a designer-quality fabric.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:24.220]  Shirts like this in stores will be $50.
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.501]  It's $24.
[00:56:25.501 --> 00:56:28.281]  We have a lot of shirts that are $9 if you want.
[00:56:28.281 --> 00:56:30.022]  They just don't have a soft fabric.
[00:56:30.022 --> 00:56:32.323]  We have really high-quality ball caps with Infowars.com.
[00:56:33.243 --> 00:56:34.804]  We have so much more.
[00:56:34.804 --> 00:56:43.550]  And if you just simply commit through free will, we don't take your money like MSNBC does with the taxpayer money they get through government funding.
[00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:46.132]  We don't take your money at gunpoint and use it against you.
[00:56:46.132 --> 00:56:51.956]  We're just here, high quality products, supplements, books, films, water filtration, things you need.
[00:56:51.956 --> 00:56:54.498]  A lot of designer shirts are selling out right now.
[00:56:55.018 --> 00:56:57.139]  We have extended free shipping, by the way, store-wide.
[00:56:57.139 --> 00:56:58.039]  I should have added.
[00:56:58.039 --> 00:57:00.920]  But a lot of the stuff that we did have is sold out.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:03.742]  So the new specials are 50% off, are about to sell out.
[00:57:03.742 --> 00:57:07.423]  Caveman, Ultimate, Paleo, Bone Broth, Biome Defense, 50% off.
[00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:08.604]  That's about to sell out.
[00:57:08.604 --> 00:57:11.385]  Vitamineral Fusion, I totally forgot to even mention this hour.
[00:57:11.385 --> 00:57:16.967]  I get so upset with the globalists that we have got just a slew of super high... Oh, and Michael Savage is coming up!
[00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:22.809]  Michael Savage with his new big book, exclusive interview with Michael Savage, and so much more.
[00:57:22.809 --> 00:57:25.370]  I get so wound up in the headlines, I always promote right at the end.
[00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:27.071]  So we give you everything right up front.
[00:57:27.071 --> 00:57:30.412]  And Michael Savage is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:30.412 --> 00:57:33.113]  That's going to be a huge, great time to have him on.
[00:57:33.113 --> 00:57:43.937]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, NewsWars.com, and again, Michael Savage with his new book, MichaelSavage.com, and the new book, God, Faith, and Reason.
[00:57:47.461 --> 00:57:49.063]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:57:49.063 --> 00:57:51.645]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.
[00:57:51.645 --> 00:57:59.132]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:57:59.132 --> 00:58:09.442]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:58:09.762 --> 00:58:17.606]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:58:17.606 --> 00:58:27.811]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:58:27.811 --> 00:58:29.853]  And this part is most important.
[00:58:29.853 --> 00:58:36.256]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:58:36.676 --> 00:58:38.117]  That means it's clean.
[00:58:38.117 --> 00:58:39.238]  That means it's pure.
[00:58:39.238 --> 00:58:42.140]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.942]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:58:44.942 --> 00:58:48.904]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:58:48.904 --> 00:58:52.026]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:58:52.026 --> 00:58:59.471]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:05.075]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:59:05.815 --> 00:59:13.500]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:21.426]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:59:22.086 --> 00:59:27.148]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:59:27.148 --> 00:59:29.269]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:59:29.269 --> 00:59:42.675]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:42.675 --> 00:59:46.637]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:51.169 --> 01:00:04.256]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.256 --> 01:00:12.760]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:00:14.617 --> 01:00:17.059]  So, the globalists are trying to destroy society.
[01:00:17.059 --> 01:00:21.282]  They've got people who identify as dogs now that we've got to pay for because we're mentally ill and identify as a dog.
[01:00:21.282 --> 01:00:24.585]  People who want to dry their eyes, you've got to pay for them as taxpayers.
[01:00:24.585 --> 01:00:26.706]  You know, it all starts with, hey, we'll pay for my sex change.
[01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:27.587]  Next, pay for my abortion.
[01:00:27.587 --> 01:00:29.788]  Now, pay the gals my eyeballs out.
[01:00:29.788 --> 01:00:31.930]  But here's Mark Dice, transitional man.
[01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:34.192]  Don't say tranny or they'll arrest you in California.
[01:00:34.192 --> 01:00:36.093]  You know, that's the word they gave themselves.
[01:00:36.093 --> 01:00:37.834]  A white man identifies as a Filipino.
[01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:38.415]  Here's Mark Dice.
[01:00:39.099 --> 01:00:40.240]  All aboard!
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.341]  Next stop is Crazy Town.
[01:00:42.341 --> 01:00:49.866]  We're going to Crazy Town to meet this white man who identifies as a Filipino woman down in Florida.
[01:00:49.866 --> 01:00:51.868]  You guys remember Rachel Dolezal, right?
[01:00:51.868 --> 01:00:53.709]  The transracial pioneer?
[01:00:53.709 --> 01:01:00.893]  The blonde-haired, blue-eyed white woman who puts a bronzer on her face and cornrows in her hair and identifies as black?
[01:01:00.893 --> 01:01:06.077]  Well, now we have this guy who is identifying as Filipino and female.
[01:01:06.297 --> 01:01:15.840]  Here he is giving an interview with WTSP Channel 10 in Tampa, where he says that he wasn't sure if he was a weirdo or not when he first started feeling like he was Filipino.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:25.943]  And so he started a transracial support group on Facebook and found some fellow transracial people, which confirmed that this is just a totally normal condition.
[01:01:25.943 --> 01:01:28.504]  I'm around the music, I'm around the food.
[01:01:28.504 --> 01:01:30.264]  I feel like I'm in my own skin.
[01:01:30.264 --> 01:01:32.125]  I'd watch the History Channel sometimes for hours.
[01:01:34.248 --> 01:01:38.910]  Transpresidential?
[01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:41.911]  It's possible, I guess.
[01:01:41.911 --> 01:01:44.112]  We can hope that this guy is trolling.
[01:01:44.112 --> 01:01:52.836]  But this would be a pretty elaborate prank because he drives around in what's called a tuk-tuk, an Asian vehicle that is used for public transit in the Philippines.
[01:01:52.836 --> 01:01:56.157]  And if you look into this guy's eyes, he does look like a total psycho.
[01:01:56.397 --> 01:02:06.742]  This local Tampa station that did this story even interviewed a psychologist who, instead of saying that this guy needs some therapy, seemed to endorse his insanity as being totally normal.
[01:02:06.742 --> 01:02:10.444]  Dr. Stacey Stechter is a licensed psychologist with a B.A.
[01:02:10.444 --> 01:02:12.885]  from Washington University, plus an M.A.
[01:02:12.885 --> 01:02:15.026]  and doctorate from Florida State.
[01:02:15.586 --> 01:02:22.730]  She hasn't had a client who wanted to change their race, but she has worked with many clients wanting to change their body in some way.
[01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:34.578]  Quote, if somebody feels like they're at home with a certain religion, a certain race, a certain culture, I think that if that's who they really feel inside, life is about finding out who you are.
[01:02:34.578 --> 01:02:39.121]  The more knowledge you have of yourself, the happier you can be.
[01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:44.544]  And as long as it's not hurting yourself or anyone else, I don't see a problem with that.
[01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:46.085]  What the hell is wrong with you?
[01:02:46.085 --> 01:02:49.468]  You're supposed to be helping the mentally ill, not encouraging them!
[01:02:49.468 --> 01:02:52.130]  At least Rachel Dolezal did her best to play the part.
[01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:56.253]  She bronzed her skin, she dyed her hair, she put it in cornrows.
[01:02:56.253 --> 01:03:00.136]  But this guy just looks like a crazy white guy with pink hair!
[01:03:00.136 --> 01:03:03.399]  I mean, if you're gonna embrace transracialism, you gotta go all the way.
[01:03:03.399 --> 01:03:13.587]  Like this blonde-haired, blue-eyed Brazilian guy who decided to get a bunch of plastic surgery after he went and studied in South Korea so that he could, quote, become Korean.
[01:03:14.167 --> 01:03:15.287]  This is a true story.
[01:03:15.287 --> 01:03:16.408]  This really is him.
[01:03:16.408 --> 01:03:22.670]  Of course he's wearing contacts and dyed his hair black, but he really did get plastic surgery to make his eyes squinty.
[01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:39.935]  And if you don't think that's enough of a commitment to someone's new identity, let me just introduce you to Ava Tiamat Baphomet Medusa, the transgender trans species dragon lady who was born a man who now identifies as a dragon, a female dragon.
[01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:45.038]  changed its name to Ava Tiamat Baphomet Medusa.
[01:03:45.038 --> 01:03:48.020]  Tiamat is a dragon in Babylonian culture.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.221]  Many of you already know what Baphomet is.
[01:03:50.221 --> 01:03:59.467]  This guy got his ears cut off, his nose cut off, got his eyes tattooed green, got his face tattooed, and got some other implants above his eyebrows.
[01:03:59.727 --> 01:04:04.309]  Liberals have backed themselves into a corner by accepting this whole gender identity insanity.
[01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:19.157]  Not just by accepting men changing to women and women changing to men, but the whole gender fluid and gender non-conforming, gender non-binary, the 58 different genders that were added to Facebook, which then weren't enough, so now it's just fill your own gender in.
[01:04:19.477 --> 01:04:32.668]  Here's two black women on MSNBC talking about Rachel Dolezal, the blonde-haired, blue-eyed white woman who identifies as black, and they say that she may actually be black because that's how she feels.
[01:04:33.778 --> 01:04:36.960]  I wonder, can it be that one would be cis black and trans black?
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:43.504]  That there is actually a different category of blackness that is about the achievement of blackness despite one's parentage.
[01:04:43.504 --> 01:04:45.025]  Is that possible?
[01:04:45.025 --> 01:04:46.466]  It's absolutely possible.
[01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:51.029]  I mean, why not?
[01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.589]  Why not?
[01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:52.910]  It's called biology.
[01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:54.050]  It's called science.
[01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:54.891]  Never mind.
[01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.352]  Why am I even wasting my time?
[01:04:57.711 --> 01:05:01.674]  Refresh your breath with Emmerich's Essentials Organic Mouthwash.

[01:05:37.592 --> 01:05:42.054]  Emryx Essentials Mouthwash is a great addition to your daily brushing routine.

[01:06:09.694 --> 01:06:22.604]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:34.074]  We're now an hour into this worldwide broadcast, and joining us is a true visionary, best-selling author, researcher, scientist, Dr. Michael Savage.
[01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:43.207]  He's written many number one New York Times best-selling books, but he's got the newest one I can't wait to read, God, Faith and Reason.
[01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:52.559]  I think we should start first with the book and the time we have him with us, then we'll get into Russiagate and the calls for martial law, the calls for killing the president.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:02.192]  Sweden is pushing to change their flag to an Islamic flag, saying that we started the Crusades and we're bad, despite the fact that it's the opposite.
[01:07:02.192 --> 01:07:08.400]  He was the first person I ever heard, like 15 years ago, say that liberalism was a mental disorder.
[01:07:09.614 --> 01:07:21.204]  And I got that some were clearly mentally ill, but now with Trump derangement syndrome, it's a mass psychology, a mass mental illness, and it's getting worse, and the most radical ones are adding to the hysteria.
[01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:25.387]  It's like telling a schizophrenic, oh, it is true, there are men in the walls coming to eat you.
[01:07:25.387 --> 01:07:27.249]  That'll make them go jump off a cliff.
[01:07:27.249 --> 01:07:37.478]  So now the media has told them, yes, Nazis are everywhere, yes, everything's horrible, even though the economy's getting better and all these good things are happening, they are literally going insane and assaulting
[01:07:38.118 --> 01:07:43.702]  Dr. Savage, myself, women wearing Make America Great Again hats are being beaten up on the street.
[01:07:43.702 --> 01:07:47.625]  Michael Savage, you told us what was coming, so tell us the next level.
[01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:51.488]  What's coming next?
[01:07:51.488 --> 01:07:54.651]  Look, I wrote God, Faith, and Reason, but that doesn't mean that I talk to God.
[01:07:54.651 --> 01:07:57.173]  I've been looking for Him all my life, you know.
[01:07:57.173 --> 01:08:02.757]  What's coming next is just finish the narrative of where the insane go.
[01:08:02.757 --> 01:08:05.439]  When the insane take over the asylum, what do they do?
[01:08:05.439 --> 01:08:07.681]  They kill everyone in sight, then they start eating each other.
[01:08:08.467 --> 01:08:09.328]  They eat each other.
[01:08:09.328 --> 01:08:10.348]  They become cannibals.
[01:08:10.348 --> 01:08:15.852]  I predict cannibalism is on the horizon, which will be sold as a wholesome alternative to veganism.
[01:08:16.736 --> 01:08:20.477]  In other words, you go all the way down the line of no living creatures, but now eat people.
[01:08:20.477 --> 01:08:22.117]  Because that's the natural way.
[01:08:22.117 --> 01:08:30.740]  After all, that's the way it was done in the South Pacific until the missionaries came along and told the savages, it's not okay to eat your daughter's nose, which they did.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.720]  I spent many years in the South Pacific.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:38.862]  The last piece of human flesh that was known to have been eaten in the Fiji Islands was in 1939 in front of a missionary.
[01:08:38.862 --> 01:08:45.904]  When they took a young girl, you talk about molestation, they took one of the young girls from the servant class, actually the slave class in their village,
[01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:50.765]  And they cut her nose off and threw it on the fire to roast it for the missionary.
[01:08:50.765 --> 01:08:52.305]  And he respectfully declined.
[01:08:52.305 --> 01:08:53.166]  Yes, that's right.
[01:08:53.166 --> 01:08:55.868]  Missionaries save them from cannibalism.
[01:08:55.868 --> 01:08:57.649]  Never giving credit for that.
[01:08:57.649 --> 01:09:02.191]  Because the psychotics must go through hell in order to be saved.
[01:09:02.191 --> 01:09:03.392]  And that's where they're going.
[01:09:03.392 --> 01:09:04.633]  But they're not taking me with them.
[01:09:04.633 --> 01:09:05.954]  I'll tell you right now, Alex.
[01:09:05.954 --> 01:09:07.454]  They're not taking you with them.
[01:09:07.454 --> 01:09:09.376]  They're not taking your audience with them.
[01:09:09.376 --> 01:09:12.798]  All I can say is, if they want to go there, good luck to them.
[01:09:12.798 --> 01:09:14.899]  But don't try to take us because we ain't going with you.
[01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:20.314]  And what you're saying is dead on, because I remember listening about two years ago, you said they're going to eat their own.
[01:09:20.314 --> 01:09:23.495]  The next level of psychotic behavior is cannibalism.
[01:09:23.495 --> 01:09:28.796]  Inmates literally killing the wardens and then finally killing themselves.
[01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:39.700]  And they're already politically doing it with Donna Brazile coming out and Wolf Blitzer and even Rachel Maddow's brother over there, Hayes or whatever his name is.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.881]  They're all turning against the Clintons right now.
[01:09:42.881 --> 01:09:43.761]  What do you make of this?
[01:09:46.047 --> 01:09:48.008]  It's a game, it's a shell game.
[01:09:48.008 --> 01:09:54.170]  They know she's unelectable, so they figure get rid of her and get someone even more psychotic than she is.
[01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:57.072]  Someone more power-mad than she is.
[01:09:57.072 --> 01:10:01.594]  Someone more, to the left if you want to put it in common parlance, than she is.
[01:10:01.594 --> 01:10:06.275]  She's yesterday's news, she lost the election, she's burned her, her path is over.
[01:10:06.275 --> 01:10:09.637]  So they figure, you know, burn her, what have they got to lose this way they can make believe they're fair.
[01:10:09.637 --> 01:10:12.038]  Now what is worse than Hillary Clinton?
[01:10:12.651 --> 01:10:22.894]  Hillary Clinton is power-mad, but in a strange way, she's a centrist power-mad person, leavened by her husband, by the way, who's far less crazy than she is.
[01:10:22.894 --> 01:10:24.735]  I don't think you've heard anyone say that.
[01:10:24.735 --> 01:10:29.136]  Bill Clinton would be less of a danger to the country than Hillary is.
[01:10:29.136 --> 01:10:33.137]  But yesterday's news, they're old, they're not progressive enough, you know, Alex.
[01:10:33.137 --> 01:10:38.079]  You gotta get someone who's half-lizard, half-human.
[01:10:38.974 --> 01:10:44.836]  And wholly insane in order to run for office and have a, uh, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
[01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:06.255]  That without carbon dioxide, there wouldn't be any plant life.
[01:11:06.255 --> 01:11:08.157]  Without plant life, we'd all be dead.
[01:11:08.157 --> 01:11:19.467]  And of course, what's interesting is that during the period when we had higher levels of carbon dioxide, I'm talking eons ago, there was more plant life, which allowed more animal life to grow.
[01:11:19.467 --> 01:11:28.535]  Having said all of that, all the years in New York City that the seltzer men were around selling these bottles of seltzer on trucks, it was a very popular beverage.
[01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:37.315]  Well, I think that the little bubbles of carbon dioxide in the seltzer water somehow crossed the blood-brain barrier and destroyed an entire generation that's now running the media.
[01:11:37.315 --> 01:11:38.115]  I can name them all.
[01:11:38.115 --> 01:11:39.736]  Wolf Blitzer, seltzer.
[01:11:39.736 --> 01:11:41.876]  Carbon dioxide, toxic poisoning.
[01:11:41.876 --> 01:11:52.200]  Shall I name all of those who must have been OD'd on seltzer as children as they sat around the tables discussing Karl Marx and Engels for breakfast and then were sent to camps in the Poconos?
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.721]  The Red Diaper Doper Baby Camps?
[01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:58.062]  Where they could go to communist camps and sing the Communist Internationale?
[01:11:58.062 --> 01:12:02.544]  If you think I'm making this up, people don't know anything about the history of the New York Liberal.
[01:12:02.544 --> 01:12:05.625]  I know everything about it because I ran from them.
[01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:06.486]  Well, absolutely.
[01:12:06.486 --> 01:12:11.088]  There's a lot of folks that actually went through that that will tell you, like Joseph Farah, your friend from World Net Daily.
[01:12:11.088 --> 01:12:21.552]  He was a young Lebanese-American, but his parents were communists in New York, and they literally sent him to communist camp, and were literally training him to be a weather underground person.
[01:12:23.348 --> 01:12:25.889]  Well, I was never trained to be a weather underground person.
[01:12:25.889 --> 01:12:30.032]  I was trained just to get out there and not get stepped on by life.
[01:12:30.032 --> 01:12:36.415]  And, you know, here I am, you know, Alex, it'll be 24 years this March that I'm in radio.
[01:12:36.415 --> 01:12:41.758]  It was purely as a result of praying to God to open up the Red Sea for me that this happened.
[01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:46.020]  But I've told my listeners, and I'm going to tell them again today, and I'd like to mention it to your great audience,
[01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:48.931]  Okay, what's this with the God book, Savage?
[01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.191]  What, did you suddenly find religion?
[01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:52.072]  It's not that I found religion.
[01:12:52.072 --> 01:12:57.974]  I've been searching for... I've been looking for God ever since I've been a little boy.
[01:12:57.974 --> 01:13:02.335]  Whether it was the little boy story that I tell boy in the... papers in the street.
[01:13:02.335 --> 01:13:05.996]  Four-year-old kid, Bronx, Longfellow Avenue.
[01:13:05.996 --> 01:13:08.057]  A Jewish newspaper is blowing up the street.
[01:13:08.883 --> 01:13:10.104]  I thought it was a holy book.
[01:13:10.104 --> 01:13:13.347]  I didn't even understand the language, but I thought it was a holy book.
[01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:16.910]  I ran after these sheets of paper in the street, bundled them up in the wind.
[01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:18.211]  It's a true story.
[01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:21.134]  Brought home this whole bundle of paper.
[01:13:21.134 --> 01:13:22.375]  Mom, look what I found.
[01:13:22.375 --> 01:13:23.116]  Look what I found.
[01:13:23.116 --> 01:13:24.217]  I saved this.
[01:13:24.217 --> 01:13:25.778]  And she laughed and she patted me on the head.
[01:13:25.778 --> 01:13:26.759]  She said, it's okay, Michael.
[01:13:26.759 --> 01:13:28.200]  It's just a newspaper.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.342]  So I've been looking for evidence.
[01:13:30.342 --> 01:13:31.123]  The evidence.
[01:13:31.123 --> 01:13:31.723]  The evidence.
[01:13:31.723 --> 01:13:32.504]  The evidence.
[01:13:32.504 --> 01:13:34.266]  And all I found are glimpses.
[01:13:34.266 --> 01:13:35.747]  And here's my most important point.
[01:13:36.327 --> 01:13:38.808]  It's my Einsteinian moment, Alex.
[01:13:38.808 --> 01:13:41.350]  I discovered it in writing this book.
[01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:43.030]  Why is God invisible to us?
[01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:45.232]  Why are we not idol worshippers?
[01:13:45.232 --> 01:13:52.615]  Why are we not worshipping period blood and chicken feathers, as so many of the immigrants seem to do in basements?
[01:13:52.615 --> 01:13:55.997]  You know, with chickens and vultures and God knows what.
[01:13:55.997 --> 01:14:03.020]  You drive around San Francisco, there used to be, in New York, on the cars, a little Saint Christopher medal on the dashboard, right?
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.481]  I figured they're nice Catholic people.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:08.924]  You drive around in San Francisco, they can't even see through the windshield.
[01:14:08.924 --> 01:14:12.927]  Dreamcatchers, pillows, voodoo dolls.
[01:14:12.927 --> 01:14:15.910]  This is the meltdown of the United States of America.
[01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:26.320]  Once we lost our connection to the roots of America, which was deeply rooted in monotheism, in one God, once we lost that, we started to lose America.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.722]  And it all started with Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary,
[01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:30.647]  And William Kunstler.
[01:14:30.647 --> 01:14:33.589]  The three most evil people in the history of this country.
[01:14:33.589 --> 01:14:36.952]  Who took this country from where it was to where it is.
[01:14:36.952 --> 01:14:39.894]  And we've only begun on this insane road, Alex.
[01:14:39.894 --> 01:14:40.775]  You know it and I know it.
[01:14:40.775 --> 01:14:42.336]  You live it every day.
[01:14:42.336 --> 01:14:45.118]  So what are we on the other side of reality supposed to do?
[01:14:45.118 --> 01:14:45.619]  Put up with it?
[01:14:46.573 --> 01:14:47.234]  Well, we do.
[01:14:47.234 --> 01:14:49.437]  But we gotta resist the resistors.
[01:14:49.437 --> 01:14:50.939]  Because we are the true resistance.
[01:14:50.939 --> 01:14:52.080]  They're garbage.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.202]  They're nothing.
[01:14:53.202 --> 01:14:53.983]  They're insane.
[01:14:53.983 --> 01:14:56.026]  They'll go away like you blow them down in the wind.
[01:14:56.026 --> 01:14:58.409]  And historically, we're gonna come back and talk about it.
[01:14:58.409 --> 01:14:59.550]  I'm not to fear them.
[01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:00.592]  They're nothing.
[01:15:00.592 --> 01:15:01.273]  They're garbage.
[01:15:01.713 --> 01:15:10.759]  And I want to know why the Hells Angels haven't come out, the plumbers haven't come out with pipes, the electricians haven't come out with wire, and said, cross this line.
[01:15:10.759 --> 01:15:11.680]  That's it.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:18.685]  You know, back in the 60s, during the anti-war demonstrations, in New York, the head of the plumbers union said, enough is enough with these scumbags.
[01:15:19.245 --> 01:15:23.189]  And he called out the plumbers to come out to the next hippie march.
[01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:24.651]  Let me tell you something.
[01:15:24.651 --> 01:15:27.254]  The hippies never marched again where the plumbers were.
[01:15:27.254 --> 01:15:28.355]  And that's what has to happen.
[01:15:28.355 --> 01:15:29.977]  There has to be a line in this country.
[01:15:29.977 --> 01:15:31.799]  It's enough of these insane crybabies.
[01:15:32.876 --> 01:15:35.357]  All right, Michael Savage is on fire today.
[01:15:35.357 --> 01:15:38.599]  So we're going to come back and get more into the book, because he's absolutely right.
[01:15:38.599 --> 01:15:40.720]  He calls it his Einsteinian moment.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.380]  It's true.
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:47.823]  Once you have just basic good God out of your life, you disintegrate into human sacrifice idiocy.
[01:15:47.823 --> 01:15:51.084]  The mass mental craziness is intensifying.
[01:15:51.084 --> 01:15:52.325]  We'll cover it on the other side.
[01:15:55.569 --> 01:15:57.470]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.691]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[01:16:00.691 --> 01:16:02.292]  Savory and delicious.
[01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:05.133]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:16:05.133 --> 01:16:05.794]  Awesome!
[01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:08.875]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[01:16:08.875 --> 01:16:10.436]  NASA PAC Technology.
[01:16:10.436 --> 01:16:11.076]  Bacon.

[01:16:15.218 --> 01:16:16.658]  Or warm and served.

[01:16:55.137 --> 01:16:57.759]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[01:16:57.759 --> 01:16:58.780]  That's true.
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:03.843]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[01:17:03.843 --> 01:17:09.047]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.

[01:17:56.533 --> 01:17:58.494]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:17:58.494 --> 01:17:59.814]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:17:59.814 --> 01:18:01.034]  Why is this so good?
[01:18:01.034 --> 01:18:06.316]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:06.316 --> 01:18:19.839]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:18:19.839 --> 01:18:21.200]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.641]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:18:23.641 --> 01:18:26.161]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:18:26.161 --> 01:18:27.502]  These are all parasites.
[01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:28.622]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:18:28.622 --> 01:18:29.963]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:29.963 --> 01:18:34.464]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:18:34.464 --> 01:18:37.605]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:18:37.705 --> 01:18:40.787]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:18:40.787 --> 01:18:41.848]  It just came back in yesterday.

[01:19:38.898 --> 01:19:39.778]  Now back in stock.
[01:19:39.778 --> 01:19:40.918]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:40.918 --> 01:19:44.760]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.880]  It is an act of war.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.941]  It is an act of standing up.
[01:19:47.941 --> 01:19:53.503]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[01:19:59.213 --> 01:20:07.837]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:07.837 --> 01:20:16.761]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:32.136]  Alright, I'm not going to be talking much because Savage rarely gets wound up here on the air.
[01:20:32.136 --> 01:20:34.959]  A lot of times when he does, he gets so angry he's got to go off the air.
[01:20:34.959 --> 01:20:42.027]  I'm going to try to just let him flow, because he's in rare form today and I love it, as long as he'll stay with us this hour.
[01:20:42.027 --> 01:20:43.188]  Or much of this hour.
[01:20:43.188 --> 01:20:47.774]  He's got the new book out that I can't wait to read, God, Faith and Reason, Michael Savage.
[01:20:48.214 --> 01:20:55.956]  The fact that Michael Savage was looking for God, like Carl Jung was seeing in Archetypes, meant that he had God's stamp on him.
[01:20:55.956 --> 01:21:09.799]  People that are looking to destroy God, and overturn goodness, and overturn decency, and who say there isn't a God, and who are saying that basically they're God, or they're going to destroy God, or they're going to worship human sacrifice, or they're going to worship ugliness.
[01:21:10.339 --> 01:21:11.659]  They're of their father, the devil.
[01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:14.100]  I don't care what religion or culture you come from.
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:28.425]  When you look at globalism, the leftists, the Soviets, the Nazis, all these authoritarian systems, they had a bloodlust to run everybody else's lives, to control language, and basically had a mass psychology and a will to kill.
[01:21:29.085 --> 01:21:40.931]  And that's what Michael Savage was starting to get into, and now we see the left going, yeah, we want guns, we're going to kill you, and we're communist, and we hate you, and we're going to bring in radical Islamists, and we're going to, you know, let them promote slavery in their own countries.
[01:21:40.931 --> 01:21:41.872]  We're going to have Muslim women.
[01:21:42.861 --> 01:21:46.844]  We're hardcore islamicists, like Linda Saucer, lead women's marches.
[01:21:46.844 --> 01:21:55.290]  We now learn what it's really all about as the gloves come off, the mask comes off, and we're face to face with 21st century evil.
[01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:57.971]  Michael Savage, you were on fire last segment.
[01:21:57.971 --> 01:22:09.980]  I'm showing footage of Mall of America from two days ago on our TV feed, where a Somali man stabbed another two people, screaming Allah Akbar, and now many areas of the country look like Somalia.
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:10.640]  Please continue.
[01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:15.469]  Well, on my website I put up Somali Muslim stabs.
[01:22:15.469 --> 01:22:16.830]  They didn't report that.
[01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:18.471]  They said it was a burglary gone wrong.
[01:22:18.471 --> 01:22:20.552]  I never saw such propaganda in my life.
[01:22:20.552 --> 01:22:21.853]  Trump calls it fake news.
[01:22:21.853 --> 01:22:23.274]  This is not fake news.
[01:22:23.274 --> 01:22:25.476]  This is beyond Goebbels what we're seeing.
[01:22:25.476 --> 01:22:34.902]  I have never thought I'd live through a time when you look at people in the media, they look normal, they look like they want to live, they don't look suicidal.
[01:22:34.902 --> 01:22:39.224]  You know, ordinary men, women of all races, they're insane.
[01:22:39.224 --> 01:22:40.165]  They're suicidal.
[01:22:40.165 --> 01:22:41.526]  They're digging their children's graves.
[01:22:42.603 --> 01:22:46.225]  What is it going to take for them to understand that they are the problem?
[01:22:46.225 --> 01:22:48.946]  They're the gatekeepers of information.
[01:22:48.946 --> 01:22:50.247]  We're marginal.
[01:22:50.247 --> 01:22:54.509]  You have a small show that's large in reach and power.
[01:22:54.509 --> 01:23:00.273]  I have a show that's small in a way but very large in reach and power.
[01:23:00.273 --> 01:23:06.376]  Alex, can we save the country from these insane bastards before it's too late?
[01:23:06.376 --> 01:23:08.817]  Well, this is different than other countries.
[01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.378]  We're not disarmed.
[01:23:10.378 --> 01:23:12.039]  We haven't been disarmed.
[01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:21.630]  And let me tell you something, there are tens of thousands of retired military, retired cops, and unretired military and unretired cops.
[01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:23.151]  No one's stepping on them.
[01:23:23.151 --> 01:23:29.176]  It's just not going to be as easy as it was in 1917 in Russia, where the guns had been seized.
[01:23:29.176 --> 01:23:38.164]  It's certainly not going to be as easy as the knocking on the door in Germany, Poland, Hungary, and the other places where the Jews and others had been disarmed.
[01:23:39.288 --> 01:23:41.331]  And is that why they're so upset?
[01:23:41.331 --> 01:23:46.997]  Is it because our ancestors laid down provisions for just their type of scum?
[01:23:46.997 --> 01:23:49.039]  I don't know who we're talking about when we say they.
[01:23:49.039 --> 01:23:50.100]  Who's the head of this?
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:51.282]  I mean, who are the leftists?
[01:23:51.282 --> 01:23:52.483]  Mentally ill?
[01:23:52.483 --> 01:23:54.165]  Devil worshipers?
[01:23:54.165 --> 01:23:57.048]  How many are there of these boogeymen?
[01:23:57.048 --> 01:23:57.508]  Who are they?
[01:23:58.246 --> 01:23:58.766]  Who are they?
[01:23:58.766 --> 01:24:17.894]  Who's actually... They're the SJWs, they're the mainstream media, it's the Hollywood crowd, it's the big mega banks, it's all the elites that want to... It's people like Jeff Bezos, who gets all this taxpayer money and all these monopolies, and then he's literally working with the Washington Post to try to shut me and Matt Drudge and others down and calling us all Russian agents.
[01:24:18.942 --> 01:24:20.703]  Yeah, I saw that's crazy about Drudge.
[01:24:20.703 --> 01:24:21.764]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:24:21.764 --> 01:24:29.390]  I mean, this guy sends more traffic to the Washington Post than anyone else, and they attack him to show you how insane they really are.
[01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:31.472]  But let's forget Bezos for one minute.
[01:24:31.472 --> 01:24:33.093]  We say the enemy, the enemy there.
[01:24:33.093 --> 01:24:34.494]  They want to get us.
[01:24:34.494 --> 01:24:36.676]  You touched on an important point, okay?
[01:24:36.676 --> 01:24:42.500]  God, the way we know God, Christians or Jews in this country, gives us free will.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:46.023]  We're ultimately the most free people on earth.
[01:24:46.023 --> 01:24:47.644]  If we actually believe in God,
[01:24:48.519 --> 01:24:50.440]  We come to understand we have free will.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:53.862]  He gave us life, but we have free will to act out our lives.
[01:24:53.862 --> 01:24:59.785]  The opposite are the statists, or the central government-ists, if you want to call them, all of these other demons.
[01:24:59.785 --> 01:25:01.546]  They say, no, you have no free will.
[01:25:01.546 --> 01:25:03.347]  We are your will.
[01:25:03.347 --> 01:25:04.488]  We are your will.
[01:25:04.488 --> 01:25:05.348]  We are the Hitlers.
[01:25:05.348 --> 01:25:06.669]  We are the Stalins.
[01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:07.990]  We are the Mussolinis.
[01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:09.570]  We are the Pol Pots.
[01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:11.812]  We tell you what shall be.
[01:25:11.812 --> 01:25:12.792]  We are your will.
[01:25:12.792 --> 01:25:14.213]  You have no freedom.
[01:25:14.213 --> 01:25:16.314]  You're just a moat in the mire.
[01:25:16.314 --> 01:25:17.835]  A moat in the mire, you're nothing.
[01:25:18.459 --> 01:25:22.423]  And that is the greatest threat to these globalists, which is free will.
[01:25:22.423 --> 01:25:25.186]  Individualism, if you want to call it that.
[01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:32.213]  So I, as a tremendously independent individual, I never liked anyone telling me what to do.
[01:25:32.213 --> 01:25:34.315]  It's just a part of my nature.
[01:25:34.315 --> 01:25:35.496]  It doesn't mean I'm a tough guy.
[01:25:35.496 --> 01:25:35.796]  I'm not.
[01:25:35.796 --> 01:25:36.717]  I'm not bulletproof.
[01:25:36.717 --> 01:25:40.081]  I'm just resistant to people telling me what to do.
[01:25:40.081 --> 01:25:41.262]  You're not taking it lying down.
[01:25:42.552 --> 01:25:46.153]  Whether it was a teacher saying to me when I was young, you're not a gentleman.
[01:25:46.153 --> 01:25:47.774]  I used to hear that all the time.
[01:25:47.774 --> 01:25:48.955]  I didn't want to be a gentleman.
[01:25:48.955 --> 01:25:50.795]  What do you mean you're not a gentleman?
[01:25:50.795 --> 01:25:51.456]  What does that mean?
[01:25:51.456 --> 01:25:53.176]  Remember how they train kids?
[01:25:53.176 --> 01:25:54.417]  You're not a gentleman?
[01:25:54.417 --> 01:25:55.177]  What do you want me to do?
[01:25:55.177 --> 01:25:57.978]  What do you want to step on me and put on a skirt?
[01:25:57.978 --> 01:26:01.119]  You want to turn me into like a trans whatever?
[01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:03.000]  I mean, get off my back.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.100]  Don't tell me what to do.
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.181]  I'll tell you what to do.
[01:26:05.931 --> 01:26:08.074]  So now, we're facing this thing with God.
[01:26:08.074 --> 01:26:08.815]  Let's go back to God.
[01:26:08.815 --> 01:26:11.077]  The E equals MC squared moment.
[01:26:11.077 --> 01:26:12.259]  I didn't even explain it.
[01:26:12.259 --> 01:26:13.781]  It's the most important thing.
[01:26:13.781 --> 01:26:14.702]  Okay.
[01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:15.983]  So all my life, I look for God.
[01:26:15.983 --> 01:26:16.604]  I can't find Him.
[01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:17.665]  I'm saying, where's God?
[01:26:17.665 --> 01:26:18.166]  Where's God?
[01:26:18.166 --> 01:26:18.687]  I can't see Him.
[01:26:18.687 --> 01:26:21.170]  The Buddhists worship a statue, right?
[01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:22.752]  In essence, they're idol worshippers.
[01:26:22.752 --> 01:26:23.753]  I love their poetry.
[01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:26.156]  But basically, you're worshipping an idol.
[01:26:26.156 --> 01:26:34.522]  All of these Catholics who left Catholicism to fake Buddhism, you know, with the hands in the restaurants, like, thank you for the water, and they thanked the waiter 50 times for a napkin.
[01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:36.624]  They don't even know what Buddhism is.
[01:26:36.624 --> 01:26:38.265]  That's not Buddhism.
[01:26:38.265 --> 01:26:43.629]  The fallen American religious person who becomes a Buddhist, they don't even know what Buddhism is.
[01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:44.990]  Okay, so now we come to us.
[01:26:45.911 --> 01:26:46.832]  We can't find God.
[01:26:46.832 --> 01:26:47.612]  We can't see God.
[01:26:47.612 --> 01:26:48.533]  We can't touch God.
[01:26:48.533 --> 01:26:48.793]  Why?
[01:26:48.793 --> 01:26:49.793]  Aha!
[01:26:49.793 --> 01:26:50.774]  The moment!
[01:26:50.774 --> 01:26:52.915]  God doesn't want us to see Him, feel Him, and touch Him.
[01:26:52.915 --> 01:26:53.816]  Why?
[01:26:53.816 --> 01:26:58.739]  Because in searching for Him everywhere, that's the finding.
[01:26:58.739 --> 01:27:00.040]  In searching, we find.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:00.700]  That's the success.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:03.602]  By the way, I hadn't read your book, but you notice I just said that.
[01:27:03.602 --> 01:27:08.525]  The fact that you were seeking as a child showed... I mean, that's the proof right there.
[01:27:09.795 --> 01:27:33.570]  Well, I always was looking for his presence, whether it was the newspaper blowing down the street, or looking at cloud formations, or studying the stars, or, you know, I became a biologist for a reason, which was to, you know, when I first saw the bones of a bird in anatomy, and I said, oh my God, look how God, or the grand designer, created the bones of a bird are hollow,
[01:27:35.735 --> 01:27:36.956]  Why are they hollow?
[01:27:36.956 --> 01:27:37.936]  So the bird can fly.
[01:27:37.936 --> 01:27:39.597]  The bones are lighter than ours, right?
[01:27:39.597 --> 01:27:42.359]  Mammalian bones are not hollow.
[01:27:42.359 --> 01:27:46.081]  The bird's bones have holes in them, in essence.
[01:27:46.081 --> 01:27:47.902]  This is so genius, right?
[01:27:47.902 --> 01:27:58.389]  And then you look at the bird's wing, fold it up, and you unfold it, and you see anatomical similarities to our hands, and you say, there has to be a grand design.
[01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:04.096]  Then you study Einstein, you know the kids in college have the picture of him with the crazy ear with the tongue out?
[01:28:04.096 --> 01:28:05.637]  That wasn't Einstein.
[01:28:05.637 --> 01:28:17.063]  Einstein is the man who went to the perimeters of the universe and came back and said, the more I study the outreaches of the universe, the more I have to, the more I understand there has to be a God.
[01:28:17.063 --> 01:28:19.785]  That's what Einstein actually said in his later years.
[01:28:19.785 --> 01:28:21.566]  He wasn't this great atheistic hippie.
[01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:27.385]  And that's the left's triumph, is they take icons and turn them towards their service.
[01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:33.986]  Let's come back and talk about your Einstein moment, straight ahead with Michael Savage, the new book, God, Faith and Reason.
[01:28:33.986 --> 01:28:36.247]  This is something you want to read and share with people.
[01:28:36.247 --> 01:28:38.367]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:28:38.367 --> 01:28:40.128]  Michael's got a dog in his lap.
[01:28:40.128 --> 01:28:41.528]  We're going to come back.
[01:28:41.528 --> 01:28:44.048]  That's my mascot.
[01:28:44.048 --> 01:28:46.629]  And by the way, he's real because I feel he's real.
[01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:48.629]  Just like your trans people.
[01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:49.930]  Is he real?
[01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:51.250]  Do you identify as a walrus?
[01:28:52.125 --> 01:28:53.106]  Maybe I do.
[01:28:53.106 --> 01:28:54.746]  He looks real, he sounds real.
[01:28:54.746 --> 01:28:55.267]  Exactly.
[01:28:55.267 --> 01:29:00.709]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:06.432]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[01:29:06.432 --> 01:29:11.614]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[01:29:11.614 --> 01:29:13.575]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[01:29:13.575 --> 01:29:15.957]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[01:29:15.957 --> 01:29:16.597]  See guidelines.
[01:29:16.897 --> 01:29:20.179]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[01:29:20.179 --> 01:29:22.121]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:29:22.121 --> 01:29:23.942]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:29:25.478 --> 01:29:26.359]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:29:26.359 --> 01:29:28.740]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:36.785]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[01:32:58.729 --> 01:33:01.314]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:27.643]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:27.643 --> 01:33:33.226]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.226 --> 01:33:34.847]  And Michael Savage, what a treat.
[01:33:34.847 --> 01:33:36.088]  God, faith, and reason.
[01:33:36.088 --> 01:33:38.729]  Michael Savage, number one New York Times bestselling author.
[01:33:38.729 --> 01:33:39.430]  I cannot wait.
[01:33:40.686 --> 01:33:45.068]  To read this book, in fact, once the kids go to bed tonight, I'm going to start getting into it.
[01:33:45.068 --> 01:33:47.069]  Then I'll have until two in the morning reading the whole thing.
[01:33:47.069 --> 01:33:48.850]  I will get it read by this weekend.
[01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:56.034]  Because the more I burrow into the mental illness of the left, they're a bunch of people that want to be alphas, but they don't want the responsibility.
[01:33:56.034 --> 01:33:57.675]  And they're not real intellectuals.
[01:33:57.675 --> 01:34:04.038]  They want to say they're the intellectuals, then create an authoritarian system where all thought has to be approved by them.
[01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:04.899]  That's called a cult.
[01:34:06.744 --> 01:34:14.990]  And they are waging war with any stable civilization because they want to conquer it instead of joining with it.
[01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:19.513]  It's just a bunch of betas getting together and trying to be alphas, is my view.
[01:34:19.513 --> 01:34:26.097]  And Michael Savage, who just joined us, was getting into... I like the Brave New World analogy.
[01:34:26.097 --> 01:34:27.218]  Alpha, beta, gamma, delta.
[01:34:27.218 --> 01:34:28.418]  I think they're more like deltas.
[01:34:28.418 --> 01:34:30.600]  You look at guys like Wolf Blitzer.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.501]  Do you actually think he's even a beta?
[01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:33.662]  These people are fakers.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.501]  There's nothing there.
[01:34:35.501 --> 01:34:36.502]  There's no education.
[01:34:36.502 --> 01:34:37.303]  There's no knowledge.
[01:34:37.303 --> 01:34:39.184]  There's no history.
[01:34:39.184 --> 01:34:40.325]  Or you bring others up.
[01:34:40.325 --> 01:34:41.627]  Well, what have they actually achieved?
[01:34:41.627 --> 01:34:41.987]  Who are they?
[01:34:41.987 --> 01:34:44.349]  What have they written that anyone will remember?
[01:34:44.349 --> 01:34:53.938]  Alex, I have to interject right now because I believe my book today, this one is my most important book, I think it's the definitive book I've written that could lead America back to the standards we hold in esteem.
[01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:58.113]  It may sound too megalomaniacal for most people, but you know what?
[01:34:58.113 --> 01:34:58.473]  So what?
[01:34:58.473 --> 01:34:59.154]  I've got to say it.
[01:34:59.154 --> 01:35:00.375]  If I won't, who will?
[01:35:00.375 --> 01:35:01.716]  If I'm not for myself, who will be?
[01:35:01.716 --> 01:35:02.817]  If I'm only for myself, who am I?
[01:35:02.817 --> 01:35:05.039]  But it's no brag, just fact.
[01:35:05.039 --> 01:35:10.504]  If not for people like you and a few others, Matt Drudge, Donald Trump, let's say it, myself and a few others,
[01:35:11.404 --> 01:35:12.985]  If we weren't here, we would have lost.
[01:35:12.985 --> 01:35:15.566]  So we have to admit, we are the resistance.
[01:35:15.566 --> 01:35:17.286]  Our audience is really the key.
[01:35:17.286 --> 01:35:18.327]  And so it's true.
[01:35:18.327 --> 01:35:21.168]  We would be totally defeated if it wasn't for us.
[01:35:21.168 --> 01:35:22.248]  And that means our audience.
[01:35:22.248 --> 01:35:24.089]  And we're not taking credit.
[01:35:24.089 --> 01:35:27.950]  We're saying, we've got the munitions that will blow the enemy up.
[01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:29.331]  We'd be out of business.
[01:35:30.111 --> 01:35:33.535]  Alex, I want to do something for you and your audience, which is this.
[01:35:33.535 --> 01:35:34.556]  You know, there's a lot of books.
[01:35:34.556 --> 01:35:36.297]  There's a lot of Hackney writing.
[01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:38.219]  This is my Magnus Opus.
[01:35:38.219 --> 01:35:40.501]  It's based on my entire life quest.
[01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:42.884]  Can I read you a half of a page?
[01:35:42.884 --> 01:35:43.865]  Hey, please take over.
[01:35:43.865 --> 01:35:44.706]  Please do the next segment.
[01:35:44.706 --> 01:35:45.326]  You've got the floor.
[01:35:45.326 --> 01:35:45.667]  Go ahead.
[01:35:45.667 --> 01:35:48.650]  I was at a funeral for a friend, a friend's father.
[01:35:51.693 --> 01:35:56.395]  I had told a friend of mine who was an American, you know, World War II hero, who was a bit of a Nazi.
[01:35:56.395 --> 01:35:57.156]  I loved him anyway.
[01:35:57.156 --> 01:35:58.116]  We're friends.
[01:35:58.116 --> 01:36:02.258]  We argue all the time, but we had a mutual respect for each other.
[01:36:02.258 --> 01:36:04.900]  And we'd fight, argue, whatever.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.260]  So my friend's father dies.
[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.781]  Henry had survived Auschwitz.
[01:36:07.781 --> 01:36:11.303]  They cut three of his fingers off in a saw.
[01:36:11.303 --> 01:36:13.264]  He was an extremely bitter man.
[01:36:13.264 --> 01:36:15.045]  So he dies.
[01:36:15.045 --> 01:36:18.126]  And so, I go to the funeral.
[01:36:18.126 --> 01:36:19.867]  And my friend of Nazi sympathies was Bob.
[01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:23.097]  So I'm going to read from there.
[01:36:23.097 --> 01:36:23.858]  It's a half a page.
[01:36:23.858 --> 01:36:30.003]  So Bob shut his mouth that night, many years ago, and as I've said, he tends to harbor certain Nazi sentiments.
[01:36:30.003 --> 01:36:36.529]  So when I told him about Murray's mutilated hand, I wasn't surprised at his lack of immediate pitying sounds.
[01:36:36.529 --> 01:36:39.071]  But I like a challenge, so I went on.
[01:36:39.071 --> 01:36:41.113]  Murray never cried about his hand, I told Bob.
[01:36:41.113 --> 01:36:42.615]  He came to America with Florence.
[01:36:43.248 --> 01:36:46.009]  We met somewhere over there and had a family, namely Joel.
[01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:48.010]  He was full of life, this Murray.
[01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:48.971]  He was a big drinker.
[01:36:48.971 --> 01:36:50.052]  He loved women.
[01:36:50.052 --> 01:36:52.673]  He beat his son with a strap, but he was a big personality.
[01:36:52.673 --> 01:36:54.614]  Bob nodded at that.
[01:36:54.614 --> 01:36:59.076]  I think the anti-Semite in him liked the never cried and beat his son parts of Murray.
[01:36:59.076 --> 01:37:02.218]  So I proceeded with my funeral story.
[01:37:02.218 --> 01:37:04.499]  I had lost touch with my friend Joel for a few years.
[01:37:04.499 --> 01:37:08.661]  His wife threw him out for beating her and at least one of their daughters.
[01:37:08.661 --> 01:37:12.403]  And he was in one of his episodic hidings, this time from the Sheriff's Department.
[01:37:13.075 --> 01:37:18.257]  They were after him for his house and all his earnings to give to his greedy wife.
[01:37:18.257 --> 01:37:20.738]  Somehow I heard his father, Murray, had cancer and was dying.
[01:37:20.738 --> 01:37:23.759]  I called his mother and went over a few days later.
[01:37:23.759 --> 01:37:25.340]  We brought over a bag of groceries.
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:29.402]  You know, French bread, a pound of sliced turkey, some wine, some vegetables, and a quarter milk.
[01:37:29.402 --> 01:37:32.343]  The usual stuff you bring with someone sick, poor, and housebound.
[01:37:32.343 --> 01:37:35.264]  Florence and Joel greeted us at the door of their little one-bedroom apartment.
[01:37:36.721 --> 01:37:41.706]  I always liked it there, remembering the holidays in my own house when I was a boy.
[01:37:41.706 --> 01:37:48.794]  Having been in the antique business like my deceased father, Benny, the place was filled with oversized, high-quality furniture and paintings.
[01:37:48.794 --> 01:37:53.018]  Murray was in a bathrobe and a gigantic English armchair, shrunken but beautiful in a way.
[01:37:53.018 --> 01:37:53.939]  He pulled me close and said,
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.821]  I remember when you took me and Joel to Berkeley almost 20 years ago.
[01:37:58.821 --> 01:38:00.402]  I know you almost 20 years.
[01:38:00.402 --> 01:38:02.042]  That's not a short time, he said.
[01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:04.683]  You took me to a bar on Telegraph Avenue.
[01:38:04.683 --> 01:38:07.524]  Michael, those were the good times, now are the bad times.
[01:38:07.524 --> 01:38:09.124]  Bob, I trotted, you hear this?
[01:38:09.124 --> 01:38:12.165]  I extend one good deed 20 years ago, and this guy remembers.
[01:38:12.165 --> 01:38:15.647]  It's like one of the best moments of his life, this one drink I bought him.
[01:38:15.647 --> 01:38:20.748]  So he goes fast into the hospital, where he insists they let him out, probably to die at home.
[01:38:20.748 --> 01:38:22.829]  And three or four days later, boom, it's over like that.
[01:38:22.829 --> 01:38:23.429]  Joel told me
[01:38:24.187 --> 01:38:27.509]  He had been sick most of the night, vomiting, probably those toxic chemicals.
[01:38:27.509 --> 01:38:32.831]  He forces himself up and says, Joel, she's there on your left, the angel of death!
[01:38:32.831 --> 01:38:33.611]  Joel gets scared.
[01:38:33.611 --> 01:38:36.212]  He says, Pop, there's nobody here but me and Mom.
[01:38:36.212 --> 01:38:38.654]  Murray stares at the big chair across the small room.
[01:38:38.654 --> 01:38:41.015]  To your right, Joel, on the couch!
[01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:41.915]  There, there!
[01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:45.257]  He stands up, starts to walk across the room and collapses.
[01:38:45.257 --> 01:38:48.418]  I can see that even the anti-Semite Bob is tearing up.
[01:38:49.807 --> 01:38:51.108]  Wiping the tears from his face.
[01:38:51.108 --> 01:38:53.488]  Listen, you racist bastard, I said to him.
[01:38:53.488 --> 01:39:04.672]  Looking at that hole in the ground with Murray's caskets so bare and hearing the rabbi's ancient chant and watching the young Mexican gravediggers move by that chant, I became reminded of my own hole waiting.
[01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:12.515]  I never knew where I wanted to live, I whispered to Joel's friend from Israeli intelligence, and I sure don't know where I want to die.
[01:39:12.515 --> 01:39:17.857]  We never know where we're going to die, he reminded me with a 70s rockers cackle and grin.
[01:39:20.731 --> 01:39:22.171]  That's it.
[01:39:22.171 --> 01:39:23.051]  I write jazz.
[01:39:23.051 --> 01:39:25.872]  See, people think of me in a way that I'm not.
[01:39:25.872 --> 01:39:26.992]  They make me into what I'm not.
[01:39:26.992 --> 01:39:27.992]  They categorize you.
[01:39:27.992 --> 01:39:30.633]  They categorize me.
[01:39:30.633 --> 01:39:35.214]  I'm fundamentally a poet and a writer who's also got some political beliefs.
[01:39:35.214 --> 01:39:37.994]  I'm not a politician who also writes.
[01:39:37.994 --> 01:39:40.375]  And they want to challenge me on a literary level.
[01:39:40.375 --> 01:39:42.615]  If they want to challenge me, let them write something better than that.
[01:39:42.615 --> 01:39:44.115]  It's in God, faith, and reason.
[01:39:44.115 --> 01:39:45.756]  This is not a book of preachy.
[01:39:45.756 --> 01:39:46.776]  This is a book of stories.
[01:39:47.558 --> 01:39:54.964]  Well, exactly, and what I get from that is death's the great equalizer, and all of our shared humanity and struggles together unify us.
[01:39:54.964 --> 01:39:59.868]  If you tell stories about life and death and friends, it brings everybody together.
[01:39:59.868 --> 01:40:13.479]  A Holocaust survivor or some guy with Nazi sympathies, that's why they want to keep us divided and dumb the culture down, because literature like that, that points out real feelings we had, unifies us in our humanity and our life and our death.
[01:40:13.479 --> 01:40:16.421]  The vision is what we're talking about, and we have to remember that.
[01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:18.330]  As the true resistance.
[01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:20.971]  Isn't it interesting how smart the devil is?
[01:40:20.971 --> 01:40:24.813]  They take we who are the resistance and make themselves into resistors.
[01:40:24.813 --> 01:40:25.233]  Exactly.
[01:40:25.233 --> 01:40:29.895]  I see all these dumb idiots driving around here in San Francisco with the bumper stickers that say resist.
[01:40:29.895 --> 01:40:33.176]  And you've been saying and I've been saying we are the resistance for decades.
[01:40:33.176 --> 01:40:34.556]  Suddenly they're the resistance.
[01:40:34.556 --> 01:40:36.137]  No, we haven't taken the country back.
[01:40:36.137 --> 01:40:38.498]  We're just beginning to pull the puss out.
[01:40:41.302 --> 01:40:42.603]  Well, I understand all of it.
[01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:46.466]  The hatred for Donald Trump is not really a hatred for Donald Trump.
[01:40:46.466 --> 01:40:50.329]  It's a hatred for white, heterosexual, Christian males.
[01:40:50.329 --> 01:40:51.230]  We know that.
[01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:52.611]  Everyone knows that.
[01:40:52.611 --> 01:40:55.594]  It's because he's a white, heterosexual, Christian male.
[01:40:55.594 --> 01:40:59.157]  It's not because he's a left-winger or a right-winger.
[01:40:59.157 --> 01:41:04.642]  They just wanted somebody other than a white, heterosexual, Christian male in the White House.
[01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:05.022]  Period.
[01:41:05.022 --> 01:41:05.602]  End of story.
[01:41:06.343 --> 01:41:09.064]  I was going to ask you to do one more little segment after the break.
[01:41:09.064 --> 01:41:16.105]  Now suddenly it's a coming out, not mainly by minorities, it's mainly white people and others saying, whites are evil, get rid of them.
[01:41:16.105 --> 01:41:17.525]  If you have a white baby, abort it.
[01:41:17.525 --> 01:41:19.006]  Major feminist magazines.
[01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:27.028]  This isn't just a few people, the left is really showing us that they're anti-Christian, anti-white, to a Hitlerian level, but reversed.
[01:41:27.028 --> 01:41:29.988]  But Hitler wasn't a Christian, he was anti-Christian.
[01:41:29.988 --> 01:41:31.489]  This is how it started.
[01:41:31.489 --> 01:41:33.489]  This is what they do, they demonize us first.
[01:41:34.318 --> 01:41:37.040]  Then they march us into the camps and then they kill us.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.282]  I'm warning people out there.
[01:41:38.282 --> 01:41:39.503]  It's much worse than they think.
[01:41:39.503 --> 01:41:41.645]  It starts with an idea.
[01:41:41.645 --> 01:41:47.910]  The Holocaust started with an idea written by a French anti-Semite a long time before the ovens were actually built.
[01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:51.934]  A long time before the Zyklon B was actually manufactured.
[01:41:51.934 --> 01:41:54.116]  I'm warning everybody listening to me.
[01:41:54.116 --> 01:41:57.519]  These professors are the true evil Nazis of our time.
[01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:01.663]  These must be weeded out like the poison that they are.
[01:42:01.663 --> 01:42:09.190]  And the universities that harbor these evil, failed intellects must be called on the carpet as well.
[01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:10.271]  I blame the universities.
[01:42:10.271 --> 01:42:12.433]  I don't blame these marginal psychotics.
[01:42:12.433 --> 01:42:12.973]  Pol Pot.
[01:42:12.973 --> 01:42:14.715]  How did Pol Pot start?
[01:42:14.715 --> 01:42:17.177]  A little tiny guy in Cambodia.
[01:42:17.177 --> 01:42:19.339]  He went to Paris to study Marxism.
[01:42:19.339 --> 01:42:21.261]  He became enthralled with Marxism.
[01:42:21.261 --> 01:42:23.523]  He came back and introduced Marxism in Cambodia.
[01:42:24.119 --> 01:42:26.500]  He put together the 13-year-olds, the 14-year-olds.
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:28.381]  He gave them the red bandanas.
[01:42:28.381 --> 01:42:29.862]  He called them the Red Brigades.
[01:42:29.862 --> 01:42:31.423]  What did the Red Brigades do?
[01:42:31.423 --> 01:42:33.024]  The Khmer Rouge.
[01:42:33.024 --> 01:42:36.205]  They went and they started by humiliating the middle class.
[01:42:36.205 --> 01:42:37.086]  Their own race now.
[01:42:38.228 --> 01:42:42.012]  Doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects... Hold on, do one more segment.
[01:42:42.012 --> 01:42:54.506]  Explain the process of how they get a group ready to be exterminated, and you see it again, exactly being followed formulaically, and then you hear the Weathermen and others saying, we're gonna round up the Christians and Conservatives, we're gonna kill you!
[01:42:55.805 --> 01:43:03.267]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:43:03.267 --> 01:43:16.470]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:43:17.410 --> 01:43:29.324]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:43:29.324 --> 01:43:35.290]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:43:36.031 --> 01:43:45.039]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.

[01:43:58.982 --> 01:44:05.827]  We're running the biggest specials we've run in like six months and free shipping store-wide at InfoWaterStore.com.
[01:44:05.827 --> 01:44:09.889]  And when we sell products at this lower price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[01:44:09.889 --> 01:44:15.233]  But I know the products are so good, even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more.
[01:44:15.233 --> 01:44:23.338]  Especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash, or our vitamin mineral fusion, uh, fruit punch drink.
[01:44:23.338 --> 01:44:26.000]  It's got all the amino acids and multivitamins.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.301]  Our probiotic.
[01:44:27.301 --> 01:44:27.781]  All of it.
[01:44:27.781 --> 01:44:28.802]  Super Mel Vitality.
[01:44:29.582 --> 01:44:31.463]  50% off, never done that, and free shipping.
[01:44:31.463 --> 01:44:32.284]  Boom.
[01:44:32.284 --> 01:44:35.045]  Super Female Vitality, 50% off, with free shipping.
[01:44:35.045 --> 01:44:35.566]  Boom.
[01:44:35.566 --> 01:44:38.267]  Violent Defense, 50% off, with free shipping.
[01:44:38.267 --> 01:44:40.488]  With the free shipping, folks, it's a lost leader.
[01:44:40.488 --> 01:44:43.970]  You sign up for auto ship, we're losing like six, seven dollars on this.
[01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:46.011]  Doesn't matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[01:44:46.011 --> 01:44:52.335]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[01:44:56.169 --> 01:45:00.555]  You go to Infowarsstore.com and get game-changing, amazing products.
[01:45:00.555 --> 01:45:04.340]  We've been sold out of DNA Force for almost four months.
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:09.887]  These ingredients are nutraceutical grade, you know, the highest quality, the bio-PQQ, all of it.
[01:45:09.887 --> 01:45:10.108]  It's 25% off.
[01:45:11.349 --> 01:45:17.533]  The truck got in this morning, and it's back, but it is a limited run because of all the testing and all the rest of it.
[01:45:17.533 --> 01:45:18.693]  It's the highest quality.
[01:45:18.693 --> 01:45:20.694]  Read about what it'll do for you and your family.
[01:45:20.694 --> 01:45:21.555]  It is amazing.
[01:45:21.555 --> 01:45:26.858]  We also have been sold out for three months on biome defense, super high quality probiotic.
[01:45:26.858 --> 01:45:32.041]  It's 25% off, out of the gates, back in stock, but for a very limited time.
[01:45:32.341 --> 01:45:34.842]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there.
[01:45:34.842 --> 01:45:36.302]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:45:36.302 --> 01:45:38.182]  DNA Force and Mom Defense.
[01:45:38.182 --> 01:45:38.703]  Robotic.
[01:45:38.703 --> 01:45:39.583]  Now back in stock.
[01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:40.723]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:45:40.723 --> 01:45:44.564]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[01:45:44.564 --> 01:45:45.684]  It is an act of war.
[01:45:45.684 --> 01:45:47.725]  It is an act of standing up.
[01:45:47.725 --> 01:45:53.286]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:59.330]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:06.773]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[01:46:06.773 --> 01:46:12.376]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:46:13.136 --> 01:46:20.803]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:46:20.803 --> 01:46:28.670]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:46:29.410 --> 01:46:34.471]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:46:34.471 --> 01:46:36.611]  They are the anti-liberals.
[01:46:36.611 --> 01:46:49.974]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:49.974 --> 01:46:53.955]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:01.756]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.254 --> 01:47:28.737]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:47:28.737 --> 01:47:33.098]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:33.098 --> 01:47:37.259]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:47:37.259 --> 01:47:38.820]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:39.853 --> 01:47:41.675]  That's right, it's an information war.
[01:47:41.675 --> 01:47:50.386]  I go out in downtown Austin, downtown San Francisco, downtown areas, Upper West Side, New York, Seattle.
[01:47:50.386 --> 01:47:57.656]  People punch me, they throw coffee at me, they slap me in the back of the head, they come up behind me and knock my foot over and just say, F you Nazi!
[01:47:58.917 --> 01:48:03.165]  And then their behavior is so Nazi-like in the stages of authoritarianism.
[01:48:03.165 --> 01:48:10.077]  First they yell at you, then they attack you, then they shut your business down, then they make you live in a ghetto, then they haul you off to prison.
[01:48:10.077 --> 01:48:11.960]  And Michael Savage was getting into the left.
[01:48:12.796 --> 01:48:25.242]  They're authoritarianism, and all over the news, hashtag hunt Republicans, and Rand Paul being tackled and attacked, and Republican members of city councils being shot in the face by their neighbors, and Congressman Scalise, and on and on.
[01:48:25.242 --> 01:48:26.202]  They're getting violent.
[01:48:26.202 --> 01:48:28.023]  They want violence.
[01:48:28.023 --> 01:48:37.567]  They're pushing it, and you were getting, historically, with the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia, and the Pol Pot, the killing fields, as an example, but it always basically follows the same formulae.
[01:48:37.567 --> 01:48:40.569]  Please continue with that historic warning, Dr. Savage.
[01:48:41.209 --> 01:48:42.870]  I will, but I want to say something.
[01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:46.811]  The book God, Faith, and Reason is a very benign looking book, isn't it, Michael?
[01:48:46.811 --> 01:48:49.293]  Let's say you don't know me, you see this in a bookstore.
[01:48:49.293 --> 01:48:52.754]  Nice old guy, God, Faith, and Reason.
[01:48:52.754 --> 01:48:59.117]  If people took this to work and put it on their desks, let's see how tolerant the left is.
[01:48:59.952 --> 01:49:03.954]  From a benign book such as this, which is almost apolitical, okay?
[01:49:03.954 --> 01:49:06.595]  Let's just see it as a little billboard on a desk at work.
[01:49:06.595 --> 01:49:08.736]  Pol Pot, Cambodia.
[01:49:08.736 --> 01:49:15.798]  Nice professor, goes to Paris, studies Marxism, comes back and says, I'm going to introduce that economic system.
[01:49:15.798 --> 01:49:17.179]  So he introduces it.
[01:49:17.179 --> 01:49:23.161]  Then he hires 12, 13, 14 year old boys and girls, gives them the Khmer Rouge, the red scarf.
[01:49:23.161 --> 01:49:25.282]  He tells them, go out and humiliate the teachers.
[01:49:25.282 --> 01:49:29.504]  Anyone who could read or write, anyone who was literate in Cambodia, was targeted
[01:49:30.211 --> 01:49:31.793]  By the Marxists.
[01:49:31.793 --> 01:49:32.273]  Didn't matter.
[01:49:32.273 --> 01:49:34.015]  All one race, remember that.
[01:49:34.015 --> 01:49:37.938]  Teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, accountants, didn't matter.
[01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:43.484]  Any literate person was first humiliated, personally humiliated in the street like you're being yelled at.
[01:49:43.484 --> 01:49:46.006]  That's how it starts.
[01:49:46.006 --> 01:49:50.851]  And the thugs, the Khmer Rouge, then worked them in the fields and killed them.
[01:49:50.851 --> 01:49:53.093]  Now we had the Mountain of Skulls.
[01:49:53.093 --> 01:49:54.294]  That's what communism brings.
[01:49:55.347 --> 01:50:03.733]  That's what Rachel Madcow, Wolf Blitzer, and company will bring to this country unless they are taught who they are and what they're doing to this nation.
[01:50:03.733 --> 01:50:09.857]  They may not actually think they want that to happen, but they will lead to a mountain of skulls unless they are reined in.
[01:50:09.857 --> 01:50:19.604]  Somebody has to explain to these sub-morons, these sub-intellectuals, these pseudo-intellectuals, these uneducated dolts, that things start with an idea.
[01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:21.310]  Okay?
[01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:23.591]  Now, you see in this country, who's the Khmer Rouge?
[01:50:23.591 --> 01:50:24.251]  Do we have it?
[01:50:24.251 --> 01:50:25.231]  Of course we have it!
[01:50:25.231 --> 01:50:25.971]  The Antifa!
[01:50:25.971 --> 01:50:27.952]  The Democratic Party!
[01:50:27.952 --> 01:50:29.792]  How about Ferguson, Missouri?
[01:50:29.792 --> 01:50:31.072]  How about Baltimore, Maryland?
[01:50:31.072 --> 01:50:32.412]  What was that?
[01:50:32.412 --> 01:50:33.753]  There was a reason for Ferguson?
[01:50:33.753 --> 01:50:34.653]  Burning a city down?
[01:50:34.653 --> 01:50:35.813]  Attacking police?
[01:50:35.813 --> 01:50:36.753]  The killing of police?
[01:50:36.753 --> 01:50:38.374]  The war against police?
[01:50:38.374 --> 01:50:43.775]  This is all part of the same Khmer Rouge effect in the United States of America.
[01:50:43.775 --> 01:50:47.395]  They couch it under the guise of only certain lives matter.
[01:50:47.395 --> 01:50:49.956]  They use race as a shield and a spear.
[01:50:50.939 --> 01:50:56.083]  To silence those of us who see who they are, but never forget their end.
[01:50:56.083 --> 01:50:58.925]  They have said point-blank what they want to do.
[01:50:58.925 --> 01:51:00.746]  They want to kill 30 million Americans.
[01:51:00.746 --> 01:51:02.567]  I read this in the 60s, Alex.
[01:51:02.567 --> 01:51:04.529]  This is nothing new.
[01:51:04.529 --> 01:51:05.849]  I forget the name of the group.
[01:51:05.849 --> 01:51:06.570]  He's still alive.
[01:51:06.570 --> 01:51:08.151]  He's Obama's good friend there in Chicago.
[01:51:08.151 --> 01:51:11.493]  Yeah, that's the weatherman that Bill Ayers said... Thank you.
[01:51:11.493 --> 01:51:14.936]  Bill Ayers was a member of a group that said if we kill 30 million Americans,
[01:51:15.788 --> 01:51:17.529]  We'll be able to save America.
[01:51:17.529 --> 01:51:19.231]  Don't think that they still don't want to do it.
[01:51:19.231 --> 01:51:22.854]  Well, our population's doubled since then, so it'd be 60 million.
[01:51:22.854 --> 01:51:26.977]  Well, about the number that was killed in other countries under that kind of psychosis.
[01:51:26.977 --> 01:51:32.021]  So if it's kill or be killed, people better take the proper steps to protect themselves.
[01:51:32.021 --> 01:51:34.283]  Last February, I was attacked outside a restaurant.
[01:51:34.283 --> 01:51:35.323]  Remember that story?
[01:51:35.323 --> 01:51:35.504]  Yes.
[01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:37.331]  Okay.
[01:51:37.331 --> 01:51:38.432]  I mean, I'm an older guy.
[01:51:38.432 --> 01:51:39.834]  I didn't pick a fight.
[01:51:39.834 --> 01:51:42.017]  I was sitting there with my dog having two drinks.
[01:51:42.017 --> 01:51:43.058]  People came to like me.
[01:51:43.058 --> 01:51:44.820]  We talked, and some guy was on the end of a bar.
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:45.601]  Older guy.
[01:51:45.601 --> 01:51:46.802]  I didn't say one word to him.
[01:51:46.802 --> 01:51:47.383]  I didn't even look at him.
[01:51:47.383 --> 01:51:48.424]  I didn't know who he was.
[01:51:48.424 --> 01:51:50.927]  I walk out of the restaurant.
[01:51:50.927 --> 01:51:51.568]  I turn around.
[01:51:51.568 --> 01:51:54.271]  There he is looming over me, 20 years younger, a foot taller.
[01:51:54.271 --> 01:51:55.213]  One thing led to another.
[01:51:55.213 --> 01:51:56.054]  I wound up on my ass.
[01:51:57.236 --> 01:51:58.637]  Luckily, I didn't die.
[01:51:58.637 --> 01:52:00.097]  I didn't break my skull.
[01:52:00.097 --> 01:52:01.237]  The dog got scared to death.
[01:52:01.237 --> 01:52:03.158]  The poor little teddy was shaking like a leaf.
[01:52:03.158 --> 01:52:11.181]  Rand Paul had six broken ribs and a punctured lung, and then now he's come out and said, no, the neighbor hates me, he's a leftist, and the media's making excuses for it.
[01:52:11.181 --> 01:52:14.462]  He tackled him and then started stomping him in his yard.
[01:52:14.462 --> 01:52:15.142]  Unbelievable.
[01:52:15.142 --> 01:52:16.662]  This guy should be charged with murder.
[01:52:16.662 --> 01:52:17.382]  First of all, he's a U.S.
[01:52:17.382 --> 01:52:17.683]  Senator.
[01:52:17.683 --> 01:52:19.543]  How come he had no Secret Service?
[01:52:19.543 --> 01:52:21.664]  Dianne Feinstein has Secret Service?
[01:52:21.664 --> 01:52:22.424]  Wait a minute.
[01:52:22.424 --> 01:52:23.805]  Why doesn't he have any Secret Service?
[01:52:23.805 --> 01:52:24.985]  It only applies to the leftists?
[01:52:26.116 --> 01:52:27.036]  Let's put that aside.
[01:52:27.036 --> 01:52:30.277]  Let's know that conservatives and people are just too regular.
[01:52:30.277 --> 01:52:32.737]  He was mowing his own yard.
[01:52:32.737 --> 01:52:33.938]  Well, that's a terrible story.
[01:52:33.938 --> 01:52:35.318]  He could have been killed.
[01:52:35.318 --> 01:52:42.019]  But the point of my being knocked to the ground was, who protected me at that time from getting killed, hurt, banging my head, breaking my ribs?
[01:52:42.019 --> 01:52:42.700]  I'm an older guy.
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.860]  How come I didn't break anything?
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:49.261]  Alex, I'm going to tell this story on the air today several times in my life, and I'm not tempting fate.
[01:52:49.261 --> 01:52:52.742]  God knows I'm not tempting fate.
[01:52:52.742 --> 01:52:53.822]  I've seen a hand come down.
[01:52:55.282 --> 01:52:58.145]  A hand came down, cushioned the blow.
[01:52:58.145 --> 01:53:00.407]  It could be the push-ups I do at night.
[01:53:00.407 --> 01:53:03.549]  It could be a lifetime of very clean living.
[01:53:03.549 --> 01:53:05.351]  That's a joke.
[01:53:05.351 --> 01:53:08.774]  But nothing broke.
[01:53:08.774 --> 01:53:18.883]  I was in Fiji 30, 40 years ago when I was a plant collector looking for additional plants way ahead of all of the people who think they know this field right now.
[01:53:18.883 --> 01:53:19.584]  Plant collector.
[01:53:20.365 --> 01:53:22.166]  One night, we're drinking kava kava all night.
[01:53:22.166 --> 01:53:23.287]  I wanted to leave the village.
[01:53:23.287 --> 01:53:27.370]  All of my Melanesian friends, they're black people in the islands.
[01:53:27.370 --> 01:53:32.393]  They used to look at me when we drank a lot of kava, and they'd say to me, in Fiji, and I think he's Fijian, they'd look at my eyes.
[01:53:32.393 --> 01:53:35.915]  I guess that was a transracial thing at the time.
[01:53:35.915 --> 01:53:36.475]  They love me.
[01:53:36.475 --> 01:53:38.276]  I love them.
[01:53:38.276 --> 01:53:40.778]  All of a sudden, in the middle of this kava drinking, I had an instinct.
[01:53:40.778 --> 01:53:43.140]  I wanted to leave that village.
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:45.621]  I said, so my friend Dominico said, don't go, don't go, don't go.
[01:53:45.621 --> 01:53:46.261]  I said, I have to go.
[01:53:46.261 --> 01:53:47.442]  He said, I can't go right now, man.
[01:53:47.442 --> 01:53:48.523]  We've been drinking this all night.
[01:53:49.207 --> 01:53:50.208]  I said, I gotta get out of here.
[01:53:50.208 --> 01:53:53.149]  So I go, I walk in the dark along an edge.
[01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:54.890]  I go back to my other village.
[01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:57.092]  The next morning he comes to me, he was like shaking.
[01:53:57.092 --> 01:53:59.993]  He said, come back with me, I want you to see what you walked on.
[01:53:59.993 --> 01:54:06.117]  He said, you were walking on a path that fell about 500 feet to the sea.
[01:54:06.117 --> 01:54:10.739]  It was six inches wide, this little path that you were on, and you didn't fall.
[01:54:10.739 --> 01:54:15.502]  I look back on that moment, and I have to say to you, I think that God put me here for a reason.
[01:54:16.241 --> 01:54:20.122]  And I think the reason is the Cinquannon of God, Faith, and Reason.
[01:54:20.122 --> 01:54:24.483]  I believe this book could be the one that reaches to those who have left God.
[01:54:24.483 --> 01:54:28.364]  And again, it's not a book to bring you to a church, or a synagogue, or a temple.
[01:54:28.364 --> 01:54:30.464]  It's a book to bring you to yourself.
[01:54:30.464 --> 01:54:32.765]  Because in looking for God, you'll find yourself.
[01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:34.565]  People don't know who they are today.
[01:54:34.565 --> 01:54:43.887]  You'll throw away the drugs, you'll throw away all the crutches, you'll throw away the beads, you'll throw away the dream catchers, you'll throw away your evil leftism, and you just might find
[01:54:44.662 --> 01:54:46.647]  That God might be your salvation.
[01:54:46.647 --> 01:54:48.732]  Because, believe me, as I sit here...
[01:54:49.358 --> 01:54:52.660]  There's a reason for everything, and God is above all of us.
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:57.342]  As Rocky Graziano, the great middleweight fighter, said, somebody up there likes me.
[01:54:57.342 --> 01:54:59.303]  And I hope that somebody up there likes you, Alec.
[01:54:59.303 --> 01:55:01.305]  And I hope somebody up there likes me.
[01:55:01.305 --> 01:55:10.970]  And I hope somebody up there really still likes America, despite what we have done to ourselves by permitting this virus of left-wing fascism to take over the country.
[01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:12.451]  Well, I think you've hit the heart here.
[01:55:12.451 --> 01:55:14.272]  It's not just that liberalism is a mental illness.
[01:55:15.276 --> 01:55:22.205]  Liberals hate God, and they hate existing success, and they don't want to join with it, even though we're not trying to make them.
[01:55:22.205 --> 01:55:23.307]  We have free will.
[01:55:23.307 --> 01:55:32.318]  They don't like that we made some of the better free will discussions and some of the better free will choices in our life, and they don't like free will and want to force us
[01:55:32.739 --> 01:55:34.819]  Look at all the major inventions of the world.
[01:55:34.819 --> 01:55:36.360]  Trains, cars, planes, telegraph, computers.
[01:55:57.947 --> 01:55:59.247]  Medical advances.
[01:55:59.247 --> 01:56:04.049]  I'm sorry to break the news to all of those out there who don't want to know the news.
[01:56:04.049 --> 01:56:07.570]  All invented by dead white males.
[01:56:07.570 --> 01:56:09.751]  You want to make it real down home here?
[01:56:09.751 --> 01:56:11.511]  I can name one invention after the other.
[01:56:11.511 --> 01:56:14.332]  Almost all of them invented by dead white males.
[01:56:14.332 --> 01:56:20.994]  Now it is true that thousands of years ago, or a thousand years ago actually, China was more advanced than any country on earth.
[01:56:20.994 --> 01:56:23.455]  Six masted sailing ships, coal mines,
[01:56:24.193 --> 01:56:26.675]  And do you know when those advancements in China came to an end?
[01:56:26.675 --> 01:56:28.436]  When the mandarins took over.
[01:56:28.436 --> 01:56:29.837]  Who were the mandarins of their time?
[01:56:29.837 --> 01:56:33.679]  The mandarins were the central government types, the long fingernails.
[01:56:33.679 --> 01:56:35.581]  They sat up there in the Washington D.C.
[01:56:35.581 --> 01:56:37.582]  of China and they controlled everyone's life.
[01:56:37.582 --> 01:56:40.084]  They killed all creativity, all inventiveness in China.
[01:56:40.084 --> 01:56:45.007]  We'd already be out of the solar system with Mars bases if the mandarins hadn't taken over.
[01:56:45.387 --> 01:56:45.847]  That's right.
[01:56:45.847 --> 01:56:49.610]  So, the mandarins are now trying to take over again through the media.
[01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:50.751]  The mandarins are right there.
[01:56:50.751 --> 01:56:52.453]  Jake Tapper, mandarin.
[01:56:52.453 --> 01:56:53.113]  Wolfie Pritchard.
[01:56:53.113 --> 01:56:53.874]  Legalist.
[01:56:53.874 --> 01:56:56.416]  Mandarin, mandarin, mandarin, mandarin, mandarin.
[01:56:56.416 --> 01:56:57.616]  I'm not talking about mandarin oranges.
[01:56:57.616 --> 01:56:59.878]  They're control-free cultists, a new dark age.
[01:56:59.878 --> 01:57:00.639]  They want to run everything.
[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:04.122]  Very dangerous people, never forget who the enemy is.
[01:57:04.122 --> 01:57:06.223]  They have names, they have faces.
[01:57:06.223 --> 01:57:07.363]  Never forget who they are.
[01:57:07.363 --> 01:57:15.068]  They are the intellectual avant-garde that will lead to the mountain of skulls unless they're called out and spit upon verbally and intellectually.
[01:57:15.068 --> 01:57:16.529]  That's all I want to say about it.
[01:57:16.529 --> 01:57:20.891]  You know, at a certain time you got to roll your sleeves up and get down in the gutter and not be so intellectual about it.
[01:57:20.891 --> 01:57:22.072]  These people are out for blood.
[01:57:23.402 --> 01:57:25.924]  Michael Savage, thank you for giving us a whole hour.
[01:57:25.924 --> 01:57:26.805]  I know you're a very busy guy.

[01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:35.612]  That's how we fund ourselves as well.
[01:57:35.612 --> 01:57:37.833]  The new Don't Tread on Me, free shipping store-wide.
[01:57:37.833 --> 01:57:38.754]  Thank you, Michael.
[01:57:38.754 --> 01:57:39.374]  You're amazing.
[01:57:39.374 --> 01:57:40.155]  Thank you for all you're doing.
[01:57:40.155 --> 01:57:41.576]  I can't wait to read the book.
[01:57:41.576 --> 01:57:42.477]  God bless, Alex.
[01:57:42.477 --> 01:57:43.217]  Thank you.
[01:57:43.217 --> 01:57:44.298]  We need God, absolutely.
[01:57:44.298 --> 01:57:44.779]  God bless you.

[01:59:44.081 --> 01:59:49.087]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:59:49.087 --> 01:59:51.711]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:55.973 --> 02:00:00.559]  I'm sorry to have to report to you that anti-white racism in America is on the rise.
[02:00:00.559 --> 02:00:03.563]  And of course, it's liberals who are behind it.
[02:00:03.563 --> 02:00:12.374]  So let's take a look at just a small sample of some of the most recent incidents, like this brand new report in the New York Times, written by a black man who asks,
[02:00:12.734 --> 02:00:15.935]  Can my children be friends with white people?
[02:00:15.935 --> 02:00:24.376]  Who goes on to blame President Trump for having to teach his kids that they might not be able to play with white boys and girls because they might be racist.
[02:00:24.376 --> 02:00:30.878]  Quote, Donald Trump's election has made it clear that I will teach my boys the lesson generations old.
[02:00:30.878 --> 02:00:33.618]  One that I, for the most part, nearly escaped.
[02:00:33.618 --> 02:00:35.439]  I will teach them to be cautious.
[02:00:35.439 --> 02:00:36.899]  I will teach them suspicion.
[02:00:37.319 --> 02:00:40.960]  And I will teach them distrust much sooner than I thought I would.
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:47.401]  I will have to discuss with my boys whether they can truly be friends with white people.
[02:00:47.401 --> 02:00:50.422]  Let me just point out that this isn't some random post on Tumblr.
[02:00:50.422 --> 02:00:54.903]  This isn't even on your typical black supremacist websites or magazines.
[02:00:54.903 --> 02:00:59.484]  This is the New York Times, which, I mean, we should expect to be slightly less crazy.
[02:00:59.724 --> 02:01:02.946]  Than the typical social justice warrior psycho outlets.
[02:01:02.946 --> 02:01:07.689]  In other news, BuzzFeed is upset with Taylor Swift, who has a new song or new album coming out.
[02:01:07.689 --> 02:01:08.790]  I couldn't care less.
[02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:12.412]  But they're mad at her because she's not a social justice warrior.
[02:01:12.412 --> 02:01:15.594]  Or at least, not social justice warrior enough.
[02:01:15.594 --> 02:01:20.777]  In 2017, Swift is still absenting herself from the cultural conversation.
[02:01:20.777 --> 02:01:24.620]  Taylor Swift's reputation's a complicated mess, they say.
[02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:26.941]  Love her or hate her, she knows this.
[02:01:26.941 --> 02:01:28.042]  And we know this.
[02:01:28.502 --> 02:01:32.584]  It's what her newest album, Uh, Reputation, is all about.
[02:01:32.584 --> 02:01:36.666]  In one quadrant of tacked-up evidence are Swift celebrity feuds.
[02:01:36.666 --> 02:01:40.008]  Generally juicy, but also exhaustively long-running.
[02:01:40.008 --> 02:01:46.731]  In another, you'll find everything about Swift's personal life that alternately greats and thrills, depending on your preferences.
[02:01:46.731 --> 02:01:50.293]  Move over a little from there, you'll find Swift's image itself.
[02:01:50.293 --> 02:01:53.574]  Willowy, blonde, and aggressively white.
[02:01:53.574 --> 02:01:54.915]  Aggressively white.
[02:01:54.915 --> 02:01:55.895]  Aggressively white!
[02:01:57.176 --> 02:01:58.377]  What the hell does that even mean?
[02:01:58.377 --> 02:01:59.619]  Aggressively white?
[02:01:59.619 --> 02:02:01.601]  How dare she be blonde haired and blue eyes?
[02:02:01.601 --> 02:02:05.204]  Damn your parents, Taylor Swift, for not having an interracial relationship.
[02:02:05.204 --> 02:02:06.265]  Oh wait, what's this?
[02:02:06.265 --> 02:02:10.750]  Oh, it's an article from The Root, in my opinion, a black supremacist website.
[02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:18.197]  Dear white women, interracial relationships and biracial children do not absolve you of racism.
[02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:20.980]  I'm sorry white people, we're damned if we do, damned if we don't.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:32.505]  Remember the stories from Halloween this year where the liberal media was telling parents that they had white children that they couldn't allow them to dress up as the Disney character from one of their recent films, Mona or Moana, however the hell you say it?
[02:02:32.505 --> 02:02:34.246]  That's cultural appropriation!
[02:02:34.246 --> 02:02:36.807]  Well, there was something equally insane that I forgot to mention.
[02:02:36.807 --> 02:02:47.732]  Those same lunatics were trying to shame parents and stop them from allowing their daughters to dress up as Elsa if they were white because it promoted this notion that white beauty is supreme.
[02:02:48.092 --> 02:03:01.876]  And this is why a bunch of people on 4chan came up with this idea to troll liberals in real life on high school and college campuses by encouraging people to print up flyers that simply say, it's okay to be white and to post them around the schools.
[02:03:01.876 --> 02:03:10.359]  Not only did a lot of people do this, but multiple schools started publicly denouncing the flyers and it started making headlines across the country.
[02:03:10.819 --> 02:03:14.202]  The news at 11 continues with a disturbing story out of Montgomery County.
[02:03:14.202 --> 02:03:18.325]  Students found flyers taped up at a high school that say it's okay to be white.
[02:03:18.325 --> 02:03:18.905]  Oh no!
[02:03:18.905 --> 02:03:20.446]  Call the FBI!
[02:03:20.446 --> 02:03:22.648]  This is a disturbing story they said!
[02:03:22.648 --> 02:03:23.809]  It's disturbing alright!
[02:03:23.809 --> 02:03:26.751]  It's disturbing that you think there's a problem with these flyers!
[02:03:27.051 --> 02:03:30.836]  This is a report from an ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C.
[02:03:30.836 --> 02:03:36.204]  It's okay to be white sign found on doors at Montgomery Blair High School in Maryland.
[02:03:36.204 --> 02:03:40.229]  School says flyers were removed and says they're investigating.
[02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:42.152]  What the hell is there to investigate?
[02:03:42.392 --> 02:03:51.036]  Meanwhile, another massive hate crime hoax has been exposed, which is why there's an entire chapter in my new book, The True Story of Fake News on Fake Hate Crimes.
[02:03:51.036 --> 02:03:56.579]  I hope you check it out in paperback on Amazon.com or download it onto your tablet or your e-reading device.
[02:03:56.579 --> 02:03:58.260]  This from the Air Force Times.
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:04.344]  Racial slurs written on dorm room boards of black Air Force Academy cadet members.
[02:04:04.344 --> 02:04:13.151]  Racial slurs were written on the dormitory message boards of five black cadet candidates at the Air Force Academy Preparatory School earlier this week.
[02:04:13.151 --> 02:04:22.398]  One cadet candidate's mother posted a photo on her Facebook page that shows the words, Go Home N-Word written on the whiteboard outside her son's room.
[02:04:22.398 --> 02:04:23.619]  Oh wait, what's this?
[02:04:23.619 --> 02:04:28.443]  A black student wrote those racist messages that shook the Air Force Academy.
[02:04:28.783 --> 02:04:35.469]  School says the racist messages roiled the Academy in Colorado Springs and prompted the school to launch an investigation.
[02:04:35.469 --> 02:04:43.777]  They led its superintendent to deliver a stern speech that decried the horrible language and drew national attention for its eloquence.
[02:04:43.777 --> 02:04:46.660]  But on Tuesday, the school made a jolting announcement.
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:53.066]  The person responsible for the racist messages, the Academy said, was in fact one of the cadets- All right, that's Mark Dice.
[02:04:53.066 --> 02:04:53.846]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:53.846 --> 02:04:54.307]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.553 --> 02:05:05.097]  We're running the biggest specials we've run in like six months and free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:05.097 --> 02:05:09.480]  And when we sell products at this low a price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:14.804]  But I know the products are so good, that even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more.

[02:05:27.372 --> 02:05:28.373]  Super Mill Vitality.

[02:05:35.157 --> 02:05:37.859]  Biome Defense, 50% off, with free shipping.
[02:05:37.859 --> 02:05:40.060]  With the free shipping, folks, it's a lost leader.
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:43.542]  You sign up for auto ship, we're losing like six, seven dollars on this.
[02:05:43.542 --> 02:05:45.604]  Doesn't matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[02:05:45.604 --> 02:05:51.928]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[02:05:56.739 --> 02:05:57.800]  We've got it.
[02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:03.625]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:03.625 --> 02:06:08.008]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:08.008 --> 02:06:09.229]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.229 --> 02:06:13.632]  Zero Hour coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:16.138 --> 02:06:18.279]  Zero Hour is here.
[02:06:18.279 --> 02:06:22.600]  Turn the greatest political and financial upheaval in modern history to your advantage.
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:24.541]  Harry S. Dent Jr.
[02:06:24.541 --> 02:06:26.382]  is joining us in just one moment.
[02:06:26.382 --> 02:06:32.284]  But first, take a look at this.
[02:06:32.284 --> 02:06:33.344]  We don't know what we're doing.
[02:06:33.344 --> 02:06:36.005]  We have leaders that are grossly incompetent.
[02:06:36.005 --> 02:06:37.766]  They said it could never happen again.
[02:06:38.595 --> 02:06:40.616]  The American Revolution, the U.S.
[02:06:40.616 --> 02:06:52.623]  Civil War, World War I, the 1929 crash, the rise of Hitler, World War II, the atomic bomb, the Arab oil crisis, and the global financial crisis of 2000.
[02:06:52.623 --> 02:06:57.766]  Winston Churchill once said, the farther back you look, the farther forward you're likely to see.
[02:06:58.447 --> 02:07:01.991]  Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
[02:07:01.991 --> 02:07:05.456]  What if all these events happen simultaneously?
[02:07:05.456 --> 02:07:07.398]  Imagine the unimaginable.
[02:07:07.398 --> 02:07:12.645]  The cycle of history suggests that we are on the brink of something this big.
[02:07:12.645 --> 02:07:15.088]  Something of a magnitude never seen before.
[02:07:15.889 --> 02:07:22.973]  Where mankind faces challenges, endures the healing, and rises up again into prosperity, strength, and wealth.
[02:07:22.973 --> 02:07:25.694]  This is about the destruction of the old ways.
[02:07:25.694 --> 02:07:27.215]  Top-down management.
[02:07:27.215 --> 02:07:29.156]  Establishment politics.
[02:07:29.156 --> 02:07:30.397]  Social engineering.
[02:07:30.397 --> 02:07:33.158]  Financial and monetary manipulation.
[02:07:33.158 --> 02:07:34.179]  Wealthy elitism.
[02:07:34.179 --> 02:07:36.340]  And the rising up of a new world.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:38.501]  History tells the future.
[02:07:38.501 --> 02:07:40.462]  Are you ready for Zero Hour?
[02:07:42.008 --> 02:07:47.932]  The greatest political and economic revolution since the advent of democracy itself.
[02:08:12.772 --> 02:08:16.434]  Because they're paying me to have him on, he's not paying me to have him on.
[02:08:16.434 --> 02:08:21.196]  I have Michael Savage on, he's a great guest, and I love reading his books, the same thing with Mr. Dent.
[02:08:21.196 --> 02:08:30.140]  But if you see a confluence or coming together of the basic terms we're using, it's not because we're plagiarizing each other, it's because if you study history, you know the future.
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:32.942]  If you know history, you know the future.
[02:08:32.942 --> 02:08:37.664]  History rhymes, as Mr. Dent has, you know, quoted another famous historian,
[02:08:39.781 --> 02:08:45.529]  And again, we have these corrupt elites, we have the centralization, we have the crony capitalism, I want to see it come down.
[02:08:45.529 --> 02:08:55.824]  But then I see Trump come in and it puffed back up, even though it's a fraud, he's trying to do it for the general public and it's now been tied to his success and the success of Americana and free market.
[02:08:57.711 --> 02:08:59.992]  And so it makes me not want it to fail.
[02:08:59.992 --> 02:09:08.416]  But then I do realize it's still built, even though he's cutting regulations and doing some good things, it's built within a system designed to implode.
[02:09:08.416 --> 02:09:12.978]  So when do we run into that brick wall and what do we do once we hit it?
[02:09:12.978 --> 02:09:14.398]  Harry S. Dent, thanks for joining us.
[02:09:14.398 --> 02:09:16.259]  Zero Hour is the new book.
[02:09:16.259 --> 02:09:16.899]  HarryDent.com.
[02:09:16.899 --> 02:09:17.760]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[02:09:19.403 --> 02:09:23.065]  Yeah, Alex, I mean, this really, I've been talking about this for many years.
[02:09:23.065 --> 02:09:30.309]  Obviously, we have a debt bubble, a financial asset bubble in stocks and real estate and everything, and those things always burst.
[02:09:30.309 --> 02:09:32.830]  And that was my last book, The Sale of a Lifetime.
[02:09:32.830 --> 02:09:45.576]  But this book is about something I've been talking about for many years, a bigger revolution like democracy and free market capitalism that in their pure forms came together in the late 1700s.
[02:09:45.576 --> 02:09:46.477]  And you know what now?
[02:09:47.477 --> 02:09:52.680]  Central banks have taken over free markets and special interests have taken over democracy.
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:55.101]  We don't have those two factors anymore.
[02:09:55.101 --> 02:10:04.385]  And this revolution with the internet and better communication, even like cryptocurrencies and new things coming out, is going to change
[02:10:05.436 --> 02:10:09.101]  You're saying zero hour, haven't read it yet, is about what happens after the next crash?
[02:10:20.592 --> 02:10:21.353]  Yes.
[02:10:21.353 --> 02:10:23.916]  Well, and it's also about what you do coming into it.
[02:10:23.916 --> 02:10:25.858]  You have to protect your assets.
[02:10:25.858 --> 02:10:30.623]  The US dollar did the best in the last crash and will again.
[02:10:30.623 --> 02:10:32.345]  High-quality bonds do well.
[02:10:32.345 --> 02:10:36.029]  That's what does well in a deflationary crash when bubbles burst.
[02:10:36.029 --> 02:10:39.093]  Everything else gets killed, so you have to protect your wealth now.
[02:10:39.093 --> 02:10:40.915]  You have to consider, where do I live?
[02:10:41.455 --> 02:10:45.738]  How do I protect myself from some level of chaos in society?
[02:10:45.738 --> 02:10:48.499]  Because this is not going to be easy, what we're going to go through.
[02:10:48.499 --> 02:10:52.081]  We've got to get rid of a bubble.
[02:10:52.081 --> 02:10:54.743]  We've got to change our political system.
[02:10:54.743 --> 02:11:00.366]  We've got to realign around cultures that are more compatible, like the red and blue cultures in the U.S.
[02:11:00.366 --> 02:11:03.487]  and the Sunni and the Shia in the Middle East and all this stuff.
[02:11:03.487 --> 02:11:09.631]  There's a lot to do here, so you really need to be settled down and get safe first, and then
[02:11:10.231 --> 02:11:12.816]  You know, we can tell you how to take advantage of these changes.
[02:11:12.816 --> 02:11:16.444]  There's going to be huge opportunity to come out of it.
[02:11:16.444 --> 02:11:21.573]  How long on the short term versus the long term can the bubble stay inflated?
[02:11:22.628 --> 02:11:31.711]  Well, you know, for economically the worst, we have four indicators pointing down into early 2020, and then a few more pointing down into 2022-23.
[02:11:31.711 --> 02:11:39.534]  So I'd say the next three to five years is going to be the worst economically and for things like the stock market.
[02:11:39.534 --> 02:11:46.136]  But this political revolution we're talking about is going to take a couple decades to really set in.
[02:11:46.136 --> 02:11:48.737]  And we're talking about, you know, I've got a chart here as well.
[02:11:48.737 --> 02:11:50.238]  We got three cycles.
[02:11:51.164 --> 02:12:07.656]  Pointing to a major revolution like the late 1700s, a 250-year deep political revolution, an 84-year populist cycle which started in the early 30s and again here with Trump and Brexit, and then a 28-year and an 80-year economic cycle.
[02:12:07.656 --> 02:12:11.378]  So this is going to only take four, five, six years to play out.
[02:12:12.714 --> 02:12:17.835]  The bigger political revolution, and then on the next chart we have globalization.
[02:12:17.835 --> 02:12:21.696]  There's a backlash against globalization, which Trump is leading more than anyone.
[02:12:21.696 --> 02:12:22.916]  And that was my next question.
[02:12:22.916 --> 02:12:25.297]  The EU says, oh, try to leave us?
[02:12:25.297 --> 02:12:28.217]  We built a secret army, just like Germany did in the 30s.
[02:12:28.217 --> 02:12:29.498]  We're going to invade you.
[02:12:29.498 --> 02:12:33.378]  Already five countries, day one, say we're ready to fight you.
[02:12:33.378 --> 02:12:39.340]  I mean, the EU, once you have to start talking about fighting members that never voted to enter, you're done.
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:44.923]  And Spain's having to fight Catalan and on and on and on.
[02:12:44.923 --> 02:12:47.625]  We're showing this book around the world.
[02:12:47.625 --> 02:12:52.610]  We have countries in Europe, the United States, even China, India, everywhere you look.
[02:12:53.246 --> 02:12:53.346]  Sure.
[02:12:53.346 --> 02:12:55.026]  And that's what the historic...
[02:13:21.511 --> 02:13:22.896]  And that's what we're looking at?
[02:13:22.896 --> 02:13:27.953]  That's what the historic patterns and this contemporary information all points towards kind of a superstorm?
[02:13:28.908 --> 02:13:29.348]  Yes.
[02:13:29.348 --> 02:13:38.676]  And again, I've been saying this for a long time, but I've been concentrating before on the bubble in debt and financial assets, because that's the first thing to go.
[02:13:38.676 --> 02:13:47.484]  But I've always been saying, I've been saying for 20 years, since my first book, we're going to have the biggest revolution since democracy and free market capitalism.
[02:13:47.484 --> 02:13:48.064]  And it's happening.
[02:13:48.064 --> 02:13:48.685]  Stay there.
[02:13:48.685 --> 02:13:50.846]  Larry Dent, Zero Hour.
[02:13:50.846 --> 02:13:52.228]  We're going to go to break.
[02:13:52.228 --> 02:13:53.769]  Come right back.
[02:13:53.769 --> 02:13:55.891]  Folks, I want to try to fix things.
[02:13:57.341 --> 02:14:00.343]  And politically, we're trying to do it, but he's absolutely right.
[02:14:00.343 --> 02:14:01.624]  We have to be ready.
[02:14:01.624 --> 02:14:02.965]  We have to be aware of what's happening.
[02:14:02.965 --> 02:14:03.625]  It's absolutely critical.
[02:14:03.625 --> 02:14:14.772]  We're going to come back with him and get into Zero Hour, what it means, the political revolutions he's talking about, the economic revolutions, the radicalization of the so-called left, which I was never a right-winger or a left-winger.
[02:14:14.772 --> 02:14:17.194]  I'm just a populist, but we're going to talk about it all briefly.
[02:14:18.772 --> 02:14:21.613]  It's important to exercise free speech and promote Americana.
[02:14:21.613 --> 02:14:25.273]  We have a new shirt that's designer quality, really soft, really nice.
[02:14:25.273 --> 02:14:26.474]  Won't tread on me.
[02:14:26.474 --> 02:14:28.114]  With a new design of the Gadsden flag.
[02:14:28.114 --> 02:14:29.454]  It's very iconic.
[02:14:29.454 --> 02:14:32.155]  I think this is the best shirt we've ever designed.
[02:14:32.155 --> 02:14:35.376]  Infowars.com on the right shoulder with an American flag.
[02:14:35.376 --> 02:14:38.436]  Infowars.com on the back of the shirt as well.
[02:14:38.436 --> 02:14:40.917]  That shirt is now available free shipping store wide.
[02:14:42.128 --> 02:14:42.528]  We're good to go.
[02:15:03.055 --> 02:15:04.777]  And free shipping, never gone that low.
[02:15:04.777 --> 02:15:07.941]  We've had 50% off before, but not free shipping on top of it.
[02:15:07.941 --> 02:15:08.701]  So we've got that.
[02:15:08.701 --> 02:15:11.645]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 50% off with free shipping.
[02:15:11.645 --> 02:15:14.287]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Mouthwash, 50% off.

[02:15:22.571 --> 02:15:28.012]  And you're not just getting great supplements and great shirts and great books and great videos and great water filtration.
[02:15:28.012 --> 02:15:39.415]  You're funding an operation that is expanding in the face of the globalists and just trying to cover all the different angles to give the public the intelligence and information they need to make better decisions so all of us are better off.
[02:15:39.415 --> 02:15:41.815]  So, you know, you ask, when do I have authors on?
[02:15:41.815 --> 02:15:43.616]  I only have authors on, I read.
[02:15:43.616 --> 02:15:47.596]  We have Michael Savage, we have Mr. Dent on, I'll read both these books.
[02:15:47.596 --> 02:15:49.337]  So we'll be right back on the other side.
[02:15:49.337 --> 02:15:49.697]  Stay with me.
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:58.987]  Have you ever lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:15:58.987 --> 02:16:04.353]  If so, pay close attention because huge discounts are now available in solar generators.
[02:16:04.353 --> 02:16:07.397]  Perfect for backup power outages and emergencies.
[02:16:07.397 --> 02:16:12.263]  Portable solar generators provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:16:12.883 --> 02:16:22.626]  And, unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no dangerous fumes, and produces an endless supply of electricity from the sun.
[02:16:22.626 --> 02:16:26.708]  It's like having an electric power plant running secretly in your own home.
[02:16:26.708 --> 02:16:31.109]  Right now, get a $5,000 solar generator for just $995 while supplies last.

[02:16:53.598 --> 02:16:55.560]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:17:02.467]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:17:02.467 --> 02:17:10.815]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:17:10.815 --> 02:17:16.521]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:17:16.781 --> 02:17:17.281]  I don't think so.

[02:17:55.350 --> 02:17:58.475]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:17:58.475 --> 02:18:05.925]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:18:05.925 --> 02:18:11.494]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:18:12.254 --> 02:18:19.942]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:18:19.942 --> 02:18:27.811]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:18:28.551 --> 02:18:33.596]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:18:33.596 --> 02:18:35.738]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:18:35.738 --> 02:18:49.129]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:19:06.459 --> 02:19:10.703]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[02:19:10.703 --> 02:19:16.649]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the super blue fluoride free mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[02:19:16.829 --> 02:19:23.436]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[02:19:23.436 --> 02:19:33.566]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand selected for their oral health benefits.
[02:19:33.806 --> 02:19:36.248]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:12.014 --> 02:20:22.600]  Mr. Harry Dent, formerly with Bain Capital and a lot of other big groups, has a great history as a researcher and economist and author, is joining us right now.
[02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:35.447]  In the last segment today, I haven't gotten to all these videos of, oh, the little vacuum cleaner robot in your house, hacked by hackers watching you in your house, or hackers getting into your thermostat, because I covered it 20 years ago.
[02:20:35.447 --> 02:20:35.727]  You get
[02:20:38.430 --> 02:20:43.616]  You get today's news 20 years early is basically what's really happening here.
[02:20:43.616 --> 02:20:46.339]  So that's all going to be coming up.
[02:20:46.339 --> 02:20:47.981]  But you were getting into revolutions.
[02:20:47.981 --> 02:20:50.023]  I understand you're more of a political atheist.
[02:20:50.023 --> 02:20:51.024]  You're a free market guy.
[02:20:51.024 --> 02:20:54.988]  And I don't like some of the stuff Republicans have done or Democrats have done.
[02:20:54.988 --> 02:20:57.171]  But there's a derangement in the left.
[02:20:58.186 --> 02:21:01.089]  We're just because I supported Trump over Hillary.
[02:21:01.089 --> 02:21:02.190]  They throw coffee on you.
[02:21:02.190 --> 02:21:03.911]  They physically attack you.
[02:21:03.911 --> 02:21:06.073]  They're calling for death of members of Congress.
[02:21:06.073 --> 02:21:07.414]  They want Trump dead.
[02:21:07.414 --> 02:21:09.536]  Mainstream media promotes it.
[02:21:09.536 --> 02:21:12.119]  I mean, these people have gotten nothing from the system.
[02:21:12.119 --> 02:21:15.201]  All they see is an old system being propped up right now by Trump.
[02:21:15.962 --> 02:21:18.585]  And I don't want the revolution to happen if it totally collapses.
[02:21:18.585 --> 02:21:20.086]  They want Cloward and Piven.
[02:21:20.086 --> 02:21:29.276]  They think if stuff collapses, there'll be a socialist reorganization and they're going to get some chicken in every pot scenario.
[02:21:29.276 --> 02:21:34.702]  They don't get that FDR was propping up a capitalist system using socialism, I guess, as an emergency.
[02:21:34.702 --> 02:21:35.943]  You can argue whether it was good or not.
[02:21:37.353 --> 02:21:39.636]  You talk about political upheaval.
[02:21:39.636 --> 02:21:46.645]  The backlash against people waking up to centralization seems like piranhas on PCP.
[02:21:46.645 --> 02:21:50.070]  How does that feed into this political superstorm you're talking about?
[02:21:51.178 --> 02:21:56.340]  Okay, again, number one is that central banks have taken over the free market capitalist system.
[02:21:56.340 --> 02:22:03.943]  They're setting the economy to grow at 3%, which they can achieve through their best efforts of all the stimulation in the world, with 2% inflation.
[02:22:03.943 --> 02:22:06.024]  This is not how the economy works.
[02:22:06.024 --> 02:22:08.025]  It's a balance of opposites.
[02:22:08.545 --> 02:22:11.146]  You have booms and busts, inflation, deflation.
[02:22:11.146 --> 02:22:14.846]  The economy knows how to heal itself, just like the human body.
[02:22:14.846 --> 02:22:22.948]  And doctors usually spend most of their time preventing the human body from healing itself, because they want to prevent the common cold, like economists want to prevent recession.
[02:22:22.948 --> 02:22:31.770]  So, the system does have to fail, Alex, and I hate to say it, because everybody thinks, well, central banks have created another decent economy now.
[02:22:31.770 --> 02:22:32.630]  No, I get it.
[02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:34.470]  But the left wants it to fail.
[02:22:34.470 --> 02:22:36.631]  The left wants it to fail and never come back.
[02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:41.302]  No, I want it to fail so it can come back.
[02:22:41.302 --> 02:22:46.726]  No, I totally agree, but I'm saying they see free market as competition to their socialist utopia.
[02:22:46.726 --> 02:22:49.007]  How do we deal with that?
[02:22:49.007 --> 02:22:55.652]  Well, again, I mean, Republicans want to cut taxes right at the wrong time when corporate profits are higher than ever.
[02:22:55.652 --> 02:22:57.593]  Unemployment is lowest ever.
[02:22:57.593 --> 02:22:58.874]  Workforce growth is not growing.
[02:22:58.874 --> 02:22:59.995]  We don't need more investment.
[02:23:00.805 --> 02:23:01.746]  We're good to go.
[02:23:17.599 --> 02:23:19.361]  We can't look to special interests.
[02:23:19.361 --> 02:23:23.023]  They're never going to give us the right research to change our economy.
[02:23:23.023 --> 02:23:27.267]  And then you get a revolution and the people start to win.
[02:23:27.267 --> 02:23:35.773]  It's unfortunate, but the old system does have to fail to some significant degree to build the new out of the ashes.
[02:23:37.114 --> 02:23:38.595]  I just know this from studying history.
[02:23:38.595 --> 02:23:41.017]  I wish it weren't the case, but that's... No, I know you're right.
[02:23:41.017 --> 02:23:42.278]  I mean, look at the plague.
[02:23:42.278 --> 02:23:45.800]  ...prevented this from failing with all this quantitative easing and free money.
[02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:48.282]  They've not let the system fail.
[02:23:48.282 --> 02:23:50.584]  Let's look at the Black Plague in the 1600s.
[02:23:50.584 --> 02:23:52.905]  I mean, I know you've written about that scenario.
[02:23:52.905 --> 02:23:54.506]  Explain that to people.
[02:23:54.506 --> 02:23:57.949]  Why did that cause the Renaissance?
[02:23:57.949 --> 02:23:59.170]  Well, it did, you know...
[02:24:00.231 --> 02:24:02.854]  When things fail, people have to get real.
[02:24:02.854 --> 02:24:09.040]  I always tell people, look, everyday people, I'm talking everyday people, become heroes when there's a crisis.
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:13.324]  9-11 or the barn's burning, and people don't think, oh, am I going to die?
[02:24:13.324 --> 02:24:17.208]  They run in, they save the horse, they save the dog, they save the baby, the people.
[02:24:17.828 --> 02:24:18.949]  This is what happens.
[02:24:18.949 --> 02:24:20.030]  People get real.
[02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:22.673]  We are living in la-la land on both sides.
[02:24:22.673 --> 02:24:26.937]  The Republicans think if you just keep cutting taxes, the economy is going to grow.
[02:24:26.937 --> 02:24:28.779]  No, not when you've overexpanded.
[02:24:28.779 --> 02:24:34.604]  The liberals think, oh, if we just keep giving more welfare and printing more money, oh, we can keep going.
[02:24:34.604 --> 02:24:38.187]  No, these things kill the free market capitalist system.
[02:24:38.187 --> 02:24:40.610]  They kill and special interests kill democracy.
[02:24:41.250 --> 02:24:48.295]  These things have to fail so that we don't trust them anymore and we don't look to somebody to come in and give us a free lunch.
[02:24:48.295 --> 02:24:51.738]  Everything we've seen has been a free lunch.
[02:24:51.738 --> 02:24:53.419]  Free lunch solution.
[02:24:53.419 --> 02:24:54.920]  Our audience understands that.
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:25:00.084]  We're just trying to debate when is the big crash coming or how long can we prop it up while we get ourselves in position.
[02:25:00.084 --> 02:25:05.888]  And then we worry about the globalists coming in and trying to use it to take full authoritarian control, which they say they've done.
[02:25:06.568 --> 02:25:09.350]  Well, I mean, again, first of all, I mean that's why I wrote this book.
[02:25:27.357 --> 02:25:33.682]  Because the signs in late 2016, Brexit, and then Trump getting elected, against the odds.
[02:25:33.682 --> 02:25:39.966]  And the day Trump got elected, we said, oh my God, even though we were cautious about the market back then, we're not.
[02:25:39.966 --> 02:25:41.888]  No, the markets are going to love this.
[02:25:41.888 --> 02:25:44.110]  We're going to see a 20-25% run.
[02:25:44.110 --> 02:25:45.190]  Now we've seen that.
[02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:49.694]  So that makes me think, this is like the final blow-off rally in the bubble.
[02:25:50.314 --> 02:26:05.004]  And the other thing I'm looking for, Alex, and it's very simple and it's starting to happen, I'm looking for a divergence between the main indexes, like the NASDAQ and the Dow and the S&P, and the small caps, the Russell 2000 and the Dow Transport.
[02:26:05.004 --> 02:26:11.088]  When those indexes start to fail before the big ones, it's a sign that the bubble's getting ready to burst.
[02:26:11.088 --> 02:26:13.009]  And that is starting to happen.
[02:26:13.009 --> 02:26:17.812]  I need a little more confirmation next month or two, but I think we're in a topping process and this chart is perfect.
[02:26:18.652 --> 02:26:26.033]  We've had four bubbles in this bubble boom, and I always call in our long-term research, we have four seasons in our economy.
[02:26:26.033 --> 02:26:34.195]  Spring boom, inflationary recession like the 70s, a fall bubble boom, and then a depression or a winter season.
[02:26:34.195 --> 02:26:42.716]  This is the fourth and largest bubble, and people keep going on CNBC and all these financial news states saying, oh, this isn't a bubble because all these reasons.
[02:26:42.716 --> 02:26:43.856]  This is a bubble.
[02:26:43.856 --> 02:26:45.977]  It's the biggest bubble in all history.
[02:26:45.977 --> 02:26:47.297]  China's even bigger than ours.
[02:26:47.697 --> 02:26:49.359]  This bubble looks ready to blow.
[02:26:49.359 --> 02:27:01.490]  I would guess it's popping between October and January and between 2018-19 and 20 when our indicators are the most negative is when we're going to see this worst of this financial downturn.
[02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:04.233]  But again, what I'm saying in this book, the political
[02:27:04.653 --> 02:27:04.913]  Yeah.
[02:27:23.357 --> 02:27:27.760]  It's going to be messy, which is why you need to preserve your wealth, get in safe investments,
[02:27:48.474 --> 02:27:51.575]  Be in a safe place and be healthy.
[02:27:51.575 --> 02:27:52.876]  That's what you need to get through this.
[02:27:52.876 --> 02:27:55.477]  And if you do, the world's going to be your oyster.
[02:27:55.477 --> 02:27:59.919]  Well, I'm not disagreeing with you that we're sitting on top of a giant bubble.
[02:27:59.919 --> 02:28:01.880]  That's just a fact.
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:07.823]  I'm concerned there are people that actually want to bring the bubble down and have Trump's recovery fail just so they can blame him.
[02:28:07.823 --> 02:28:11.784]  That's not even looking at, you know, he's just trying to put off something that was already there.
[02:28:14.671 --> 02:28:17.394]  You know, you've been saying the bubble is going to bust for the last few years.
[02:28:17.394 --> 02:28:18.895]  I'm not saying you're wrong.
[02:28:18.895 --> 02:28:20.877]  I'm just saying, who knows now?
[02:28:20.877 --> 02:28:30.305]  There were so many artificial things suppressing the economy before, like regulations and the coal being turned off, that you add all those other stimulus in.
[02:28:30.305 --> 02:28:30.806]  Who knows?
[02:28:30.806 --> 02:28:33.809]  But I agree, it's a damn if you do, damn if you don't, because
[02:28:34.992 --> 02:28:38.517]  It props it up and everything's okay for a while, but then when it implodes, it's even bigger.
[02:28:38.517 --> 02:28:49.251]  So we'll talk about how you would protect yourself straight ahead, and then we've got a bunch of technology news in the final segment before Paul Joseph Watson takes over from London, England in the fourth hour.

[02:31:54.366 --> 02:31:56.228]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:56.228 --> 02:31:57.549]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:57.549 --> 02:31:58.770]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:58.770 --> 02:32:04.055]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:04.055 --> 02:32:17.606]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:17.606 --> 02:32:18.967]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:32:19.728 --> 02:32:21.370]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:32:21.370 --> 02:32:23.952]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:23.952 --> 02:32:25.274]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:25.274 --> 02:32:26.355]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:32:26.355 --> 02:32:27.696]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:27.696 --> 02:32:32.201]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:32.201 --> 02:32:35.364]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:35.404 --> 02:32:38.526]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:38.526 --> 02:32:39.587]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:39.587 --> 02:32:41.529]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:41.529 --> 02:32:42.549]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:32:42.549 --> 02:32:45.231]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:45.231 --> 02:32:48.514]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:48.514 --> 02:32:50.756]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:50.756 --> 02:32:57.361]  Thank you so much for all your work serving this great product.
[02:32:57.361 --> 02:33:00.023]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.390 --> 02:33:12.131]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:12.131 --> 02:33:14.333]  Because there is a war on.
[02:33:14.333 --> 02:33:15.353]  Or you're mine.
[02:33:15.353 --> 02:33:16.554]  Here's what I know.
[02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:29.591]  People are balkanizing.
[02:33:29.591 --> 02:33:36.914]  The parasitic left has always used government funding to fund their own projects, their own art operations, you name it.
[02:33:36.914 --> 02:33:44.997]  The left also usually are managers over disenfranchised groups of people that live in government housing or kind of warehousing foster children, things like that.
[02:33:44.997 --> 02:33:46.318]  It's what they do.
[02:33:46.318 --> 02:33:46.998]  It's their business.
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:49.981]  And they don't know any better.
[02:33:49.981 --> 02:33:56.303]  So if they see society collapsing, they see that as more for them to feed on.
[02:33:56.303 --> 02:34:05.687]  So the big problem with the reality equation that Mr. Dent's talking about is we're talking about how to make things better once the correction comes.
[02:34:05.687 --> 02:34:08.948]  We're talking about ways to protect ourselves but also stabilize the government.
[02:34:08.948 --> 02:34:12.330]  They're looking at ways to overthrow everything.
[02:34:12.330 --> 02:34:15.311]  And that's why I'm saying it's more critical than ever.
[02:34:16.363 --> 02:34:18.987]  To financially support shows like InfoWars.
[02:34:18.987 --> 02:34:26.037]  Why it's more important than ever to exercise your free speech and wear the new, won't tread on me, incredible Gadsden flag.
[02:34:27.213 --> 02:34:41.750]  Coal Pepper Minute Men shirt that we have at infowarestore.com because in the future more than anything it's going to be financially supporting organizations and groups and people that are fighting for your basic worldview and your way of life.
[02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:44.413]  This is something conservatives never really do or libertarians never do.
[02:34:44.413 --> 02:34:47.576]  We kind of just live our own lives and run our own lives and
[02:34:48.337 --> 02:34:49.977]  We don't want to run other people's lives.
[02:34:49.977 --> 02:35:07.681]  Well, if you don't want somebody running your life, you're going to have to get politically involved, you're going to have to get financially involved, and not just educate yourself with books like Zero Hour that, again, I'm going to be reading this weekend by Harry S. Dent, but the book that Savage wrote or the information we cover.
[02:35:07.681 --> 02:35:10.821]  Briefly, I want to play this clip as he mentioned worldwide revolutions.
[02:35:10.821 --> 02:35:12.721]  Countries working with countries is a great idea.
[02:35:12.721 --> 02:35:15.362]  It opens up markets, more products, more innovation, more ideas.
[02:35:16.269 --> 02:35:16.669]  You want to
[02:35:35.711 --> 02:35:39.313]  Put an EU army out to take over countries because they want to pull out.
[02:35:39.313 --> 02:35:41.595]  Well, that's the fastest way to make them pull out even quicker.
[02:35:41.595 --> 02:35:45.277]  You can say, well, Spain will keep Catalan in for a while longer.
[02:35:45.277 --> 02:35:45.938]  Doesn't matter.
[02:35:45.938 --> 02:35:51.722]  Once the people know they're captured, it's like some guy that's chaining his wife up when he goes to work.
[02:35:51.722 --> 02:35:52.962]  She's going to get loose someday.
[02:35:52.962 --> 02:35:54.724]  You're going to go to jail or she's not.
[02:35:54.724 --> 02:35:56.045]  She's going to be long gone.
[02:35:56.045 --> 02:36:00.788]  And we've we've reached that point where the left is trying to leave the left, just people that
[02:36:01.428 --> 02:36:02.628]  Feel like they're the left.
[02:36:02.628 --> 02:36:03.669]  Are they to dominate folks?
[02:36:03.669 --> 02:36:04.909]  It's not working anymore.
[02:36:04.909 --> 02:36:10.791]  So I want to ask Mr. Dent, historically looking at the charts, how this revolution fleshes out, how it could look.
[02:36:10.791 --> 02:36:14.812]  But he's predicted it, I've predicted it, Ron Paul's predicted it, so many others have predicted it.
[02:36:14.812 --> 02:36:21.154]  The CIA people we've had on, like Steve Pchenik, had predicted it ten years ago, that the EU would fail and things would break up.
[02:36:21.154 --> 02:36:22.295]  It's here.
[02:36:22.295 --> 02:36:26.216]  What does that mean as the central controllers push authoritarianism?
[02:36:26.576 --> 02:36:36.210]  Here is a clip of Nigel Farage, the fastest growing movement, not just in the UK, that gave us Brexit, but also in Europe, pointing out what's really going on.
[02:36:36.210 --> 02:36:36.590]  Here it is.
[02:36:37.469 --> 02:36:39.430]  Mr. Farage, two and a half minutes.
[02:36:39.430 --> 02:36:39.790]  Thank you.
[02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:49.053]  As Mr. Muscovici said at the start of this, the leak of all these papers and lists of people with offshore holdings has come about because of the Society of Investigative Journalists.
[02:36:49.053 --> 02:36:56.856]  But what's not been said this morning, and I think is relevant, is that the funding of these investigations came from one George Soros.
[02:36:56.856 --> 02:37:00.717]  Now I say this at a time I'm going to come back to so what.
[02:37:00.717 --> 02:37:02.998]  And it may have some personal interest for you as well.
[02:37:03.998 --> 02:37:14.302]  I say this at a time when the use of money and the influence it may have had on the Brexit result or the Trump election has reached a level of virtual hysteria.
[02:37:14.302 --> 02:37:20.905]  Just last week the Electoral Commission in the UK launched an investigation to find out whether the Leave campaign
[02:37:21.465 --> 02:37:25.368]  took offshore money or Russian money.
[02:37:25.368 --> 02:37:34.276]  This came about as a result of questions asked in the House of Commons by one Ben Bradshaw, somebody linked to an organisation called Open Society.
[02:37:34.276 --> 02:37:44.724]  I just wonder, when we're talking about offshore money, when we're talking about political subversion, when we're talking about collusion, I wonder whether we're looking in the wrong place.
[02:37:44.724 --> 02:37:47.807]  And I say that because George Soros recently
[02:37:48.407 --> 02:37:48.587]  I think?
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:07.502]  ...and in Brussels, is truly extraordinary.
[02:38:07.502 --> 02:38:14.226]  Open Society boast that they had 42 meetings last year with the European Commission.
[02:38:14.226 --> 02:38:19.989]  They've even published a book of reliable friends in the European Parliament.
[02:38:19.989 --> 02:38:25.433]  And there are 226 names on that list, including yours, sir.
[02:38:25.433 --> 02:38:26.814]  I thought you'd find this interesting.
[02:38:28.054 --> 02:38:39.137]  We even had last week Mr. Verhofstadt lobbying on behalf of Mr. Soros at the Conference of Presidents in a battle that is going on with Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary.
[02:38:39.137 --> 02:38:46.920]  If we're going to have a debate, and we're going to talk about full political and financial transparency, well let's do it!
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:52.622]  So I should be writing today to all 226 of you, asking some pretty fair questions.
[02:38:52.622 --> 02:38:57.243]  Have you ever received funds, directly or indirectly, from open society?
[02:38:57.943 --> 02:39:01.185]  How many of their events have you attended?
[02:39:01.185 --> 02:39:21.216]  Could you please give us a list of the meetings of all the representatives including George Soros yourself and I think this Parliament should now set up a special committee to look into all of this and I say that because I fear we could be looking at the biggest level of international political collusion in history.
[02:39:22.219 --> 02:39:27.328]  And I've said this thousands of times, they change it to Russia because they're bringing in globalism.
[02:39:27.328 --> 02:39:34.000]  These multinational groups like TPP that literally do conquer us, they're scared so they wanted to turn the investigation around.
[02:39:35.157 --> 02:39:39.862]  And now it's blowing up in their face, and now the EU army's announcing it's taking over.
[02:39:39.862 --> 02:39:44.127]  And one day after, five countries say they're ready to repel the invasion.
[02:39:44.127 --> 02:39:47.390]  This is kind of shaping up almost like pre-World War II in a weird way.
[02:39:47.390 --> 02:39:52.356]  You got Juncker, the heir of the Nazis, threatening the US, running the unelected EU.
[02:39:52.356 --> 02:39:54.058]  How does this fit into your equation, Mr. Dent?
[02:39:55.515 --> 02:39:59.216]  Well, you know, again, I've been waiting on this for 20 years now, Alex.
[02:39:59.216 --> 02:40:04.937]  In the roaring 2000s, my best-selling book, I brought in this whole network revolution, bottoms-up.
[02:40:04.937 --> 02:40:11.679]  Now, again, free market capitalism and democracy were the first bottoms-up revolution in all of history.
[02:40:11.679 --> 02:40:15.660]  Everything was top-down, aristocracy-controlled since then.
[02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:16.881]  This is deeper.
[02:40:16.881 --> 02:40:22.382]  We've got back-down with special interests, central banks have taken over.
[02:40:23.042 --> 02:40:35.286]  And we need an economy globally that can let everybody be their own thing and grow from the bottoms up, like you said, from organizations that you favor and not from some top-down sort of thing.
[02:40:35.286 --> 02:40:42.248]  All of this stuff can survive together if they all have their own spaces and their own support and the system can accommodate it.
[02:40:42.248 --> 02:40:47.269]  I was about to say, won't the globalists themselves, the good, the bad, the ugly, destroy themselves?
[02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:52.291]  Making this existential fight with nationalism a real thing, don't they get they're going to lose?
[02:40:53.464 --> 02:40:57.585]  No, no, okay, they think they're going to lose because they're controlling things from the top down.
[02:40:57.585 --> 02:40:58.266]  Bottoms up.
[02:40:58.266 --> 02:41:04.368]  Look, the stock exchanges operate totally from the bottoms up, not top down, and they only get bigger and bigger.
[02:41:04.368 --> 02:41:07.029]  You can have global and you can have bottom up.
[02:41:07.029 --> 02:41:10.750]  What we have now is global and top down, and that's the problem.
[02:41:10.750 --> 02:41:17.472]  Everything in this book, everything I've written for 20, 30 years has said we need a bottoms up revolution like in the late 1700s.
[02:41:19.153 --> 02:41:22.360]  No, I know you've been calling it for 20 years.
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:24.906]  I'm saying, how nasty is it going to get?
[02:41:24.906 --> 02:41:26.990]  Because they've signaled they're going to get very violent.
[02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:30.740]  It's getting nasty.
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:32.060]  That's what we're saying.
[02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:33.401]  You can't have a revolution.
[02:41:33.401 --> 02:41:38.121]  Look, I mean, they were cutting off heads in France, and we had the Revolutionary War in the United States.
[02:41:38.121 --> 02:41:38.962]  It is nasty.
[02:41:38.962 --> 02:41:43.742]  Revolutions are never easy, but they are necessary, and they come at times like this.
[02:41:43.742 --> 02:41:45.943]  Again, I can't stop the revolution.
[02:41:45.943 --> 02:41:48.723]  I can't stop all the cycles I'm looking at.
[02:41:48.723 --> 02:41:51.724]  All I can do is help people prepare for it.
[02:41:51.724 --> 02:41:55.344]  Again, protect the wealth you have now at the top of this bubble.
[02:41:55.344 --> 02:41:57.085]  Don't hold out for more.
[02:41:57.085 --> 02:41:59.185]  Live in the safest place you can live in.
[02:41:59.945 --> 02:42:04.187]  And be prepared for change and to take advantage of it.
[02:42:04.187 --> 02:42:05.207]  It's just that simple.
[02:42:05.207 --> 02:42:07.528]  There's going to be a major breakdown, major crime.
[02:42:07.528 --> 02:42:13.291]  We've tried to prop this thing up, but once it goes south, they're going to unloose their hordes of the communists.
[02:42:13.291 --> 02:42:20.554]  It's going to be, thank God we have the Second Amendment, but folks, Zero Hour, available at Harry Dent's website, harrydent.com.
[02:42:20.554 --> 02:42:22.174]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:42:22.174 --> 02:42:24.696]  Look forward to speaking to you again very soon.
[02:42:24.696 --> 02:42:25.556]  Okay, thank you, Alec.
[02:42:27.270 --> 02:42:36.595]  Yeah, I've got four children, and I've studied history, and it does repeat itself, and the elites are all digging in, and Trump's tried to get things going again, they're trying to block him.
[02:42:36.595 --> 02:42:53.423]  I think we could have made it out of this, but it's, now them trying to block it, it's probably going to completely blow up, and when it does, folks, when it does, I just say prop it up as long as we can, because when it blows, I tell you it's going to be bad.

[02:44:43.127 --> 02:44:45.168]  It is an act of standing up.
[02:44:45.168 --> 02:44:50.349]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy.

[02:46:02.367 --> 02:46:03.588]  A 360 win.
[02:46:03.588 --> 02:46:10.154]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:46:10.154 --> 02:46:18.081]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:46:18.081 --> 02:46:18.702]  Number three,
[02:46:19.082 --> 02:46:23.144]  We're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:46:23.144 --> 02:46:29.246]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.

[02:46:37.050 --> 02:46:44.233]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:46:44.233 --> 02:46:45.053]  10% off on AutoShip.

[02:46:47.656 --> 02:46:49.638]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:46:49.638 --> 02:46:57.286]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:46:57.286 --> 02:46:59.928]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:34.361 --> 02:47:38.023]  Welcome folks, Alex Jones back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:47:38.023 --> 02:47:40.345]  Paul Watson's just a few minutes away from London, England.
[02:47:40.345 --> 02:47:44.728]  He is wound up and has a ton of critical information to cover.
[02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:56.652]  You know, I meant to get into human brains implanted in rat brains with Michael Savage, since he has the new book out, God, Faith and Reason.
[02:47:56.652 --> 02:48:05.433]  Even if you don't believe in God, shouldn't you on this planetoid not want to treat other creatures worse than dog meat?
[02:48:05.433 --> 02:48:09.354]  Don't you have basic empathy?
[02:48:09.354 --> 02:48:11.615]  We're getting God-like powers, but we're not gods.
[02:48:11.615 --> 02:48:12.975]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[02:48:14.218 --> 02:48:21.461]  I've seen major demonization of drones for a decade because government didn't want the public to have access to them.
[02:48:21.461 --> 02:48:28.244]  And then government, though, didn't want us to know it was going to use them as part of an autonomous army that would follow orders.
[02:48:28.244 --> 02:48:38.188]  Undersea drones, ship drones, airborne drones, tank drones, soldier drones.
[02:48:38.188 --> 02:48:43.710]  But as miniaturization gets cheaper and cheaper and mass production gets cheaper and cheaper and better and better,
[02:48:45.435 --> 02:48:55.241]  We're seeing the advent of the robots, but then we see the footage of where the little robot that vacuums your house has got a camera in it, and the hackers get in and watch it and have it go open the front door for them.
[02:48:55.241 --> 02:49:00.324]  Or the hackers have it record what your codes are, because it's grabbing the Wi-Fi.
[02:49:00.324 --> 02:49:02.245]  So all of these Trojan horses
[02:49:04.608 --> 02:49:08.150]  Like the iRobot collects info in your house and then gives it to hackers.
[02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:09.871]  All of this makes us less safe.
[02:49:09.871 --> 02:49:17.255]  And it's all being rolled out with giant holes in it by design because industry wants into all of it.
[02:49:17.255 --> 02:49:21.197]  And it's that data that has the real value.
[02:49:21.197 --> 02:49:26.560]  The amount of data that one of these robots steals and gives back to the home company every time it's plugged into the internet.
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:30.782]  Because you keep it plugged in because you want to see what's going on in your house when you're gone.
[02:49:30.782 --> 02:49:32.123]  Well, they're there accessing it all.
[02:49:33.251 --> 02:49:40.895]  They're even turning hotspots in your house into Wi-Fi's for the companies to have unofficial Wi-Fi's in neighborhoods passing on and monitoring info.
[02:49:40.895 --> 02:49:43.597]  It's all a big space race.
[02:49:43.597 --> 02:49:47.499]  Or a run for the hills to get the gold, the 49ers.
[02:49:47.499 --> 02:49:50.821]  It's a gold rush.
[02:49:50.821 --> 02:49:56.884]  And we're building our own graves with it.
[02:49:56.884 --> 02:50:00.967]  Because from the beginning it has an authoritarian and a deceptive architecture.
[02:50:01.834 --> 02:50:04.076]  That's already beyond our understanding.
[02:50:04.076 --> 02:50:05.637]  And we're just in the year 2017.
[02:50:05.637 --> 02:50:07.178]  So here's one.
[02:50:07.178 --> 02:50:08.920]  This is the top video today on the internet.
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:11.462]  The new Spot Mini Robot.
[02:50:11.462 --> 02:50:12.663]  Boston Dynamics.
[02:50:12.663 --> 02:50:14.404]  Sleek like a race car.
[02:50:14.404 --> 02:50:15.065]  Affordable.
[02:50:15.065 --> 02:50:15.365]  Cool.
[02:50:15.365 --> 02:50:17.527]  Everybody's got to have it.
[02:50:17.527 --> 02:50:21.090]  But is there any discussion about
[02:50:22.196 --> 02:50:22.937]  What's inside of it?
[02:50:22.937 --> 02:50:29.001]  Remember, just five years ago, people laughed at the spot robot that was gas-powered, and the military wanted it.
[02:50:29.001 --> 02:50:30.423]  Oh, that'll never be a threat.
[02:50:30.423 --> 02:50:35.427]  And then now, suddenly, a few years later, look out once that's weaponized.
[02:50:35.427 --> 02:50:38.589]  And of course, someone else will weaponize it, so then a private group will.
[02:50:38.589 --> 02:50:41.011]  So then we'll have to have government control over all of them.
[02:50:41.011 --> 02:50:46.796]  They'll all have to be wired into safety software, which again, allows them all to be hacked, not just one.
[02:50:48.673 --> 02:50:50.696]  One ring to rule them all.
[02:50:50.696 --> 02:50:54.360]  One ring to bind them.
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:57.143]  In the darkness, my friends.
[02:50:57.143 --> 02:50:59.286]  One central control.
[02:50:59.286 --> 02:51:04.813]  And it's dystopic because it's designed to be dystopic.
[02:51:04.813 --> 02:51:06.335]  Let's go ahead and go to the new campaign.
[02:51:07.674 --> 02:51:11.615]  But Stuart Russell presented at the UN Convention on Conventional Weapons.
[02:51:11.615 --> 02:51:14.015]  They're the ones that want to ban small arms for general citizens.
[02:51:14.015 --> 02:51:24.877]  Oh, now they're going to warn us about swarms of droids, swarms of drones coming and killing a classroom full of people, not guns.
[02:51:24.877 --> 02:51:31.398]  This is all because the UN has said civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[02:51:31.398 --> 02:51:36.139]  They don't, just like most drones for five years in restricted airspace, they won't even fly.
[02:51:36.139 --> 02:51:37.459]  They're already GPS chipped.
[02:51:39.400 --> 02:51:43.483]  Then the FAA says, well, it's a big federal crime, a felony if you fly it without.
[02:51:43.483 --> 02:51:45.565]  And I can see how it causes a problem.
[02:51:45.565 --> 02:51:49.368]  They've already had drones almost bring down jetliners.
[02:51:49.368 --> 02:51:58.195]  But all the news fail-safes only make it more centralized, more easy for hackers or corrupt governments or whoever to control them all instead of one!
[02:51:59.909 --> 02:52:15.766]  I'm not a big TV head, but six, seven, eight years ago, I watched on the treadmill one season of Battlestar Galactica, and you know, the aliens have hacked into the mainframes of the Battlestars, and they bring them all down at one minute, invade, kill everybody on Earth, and then there's one old Battlestar that isn't hooked in, and it survives.
[02:52:15.766 --> 02:52:18.389]  That's literally how this operates, folks.
[02:52:18.389 --> 02:52:19.811]  And so, yeah, calculators are great!
[02:52:21.903 --> 02:52:25.124]  They wouldn't let us have calculators when I was in school, and I was good at math.
[02:52:25.124 --> 02:52:30.506]  I could bang out algebra, trigonometry, whatever I needed to on the back of a piece of paper.
[02:52:30.506 --> 02:52:33.867]  I could do woodwork with a ruler and just figure it out.
[02:52:33.867 --> 02:52:34.827]  It all worked great.
[02:52:34.827 --> 02:52:42.389]  Now my children are doing homework, they've got their calculators, and I don't even know how the calculator works.
[02:52:42.389 --> 02:52:44.890]  We're being dehumanized.
[02:52:44.890 --> 02:52:51.092]  So here's the new film campaign to ban developing autonomous weapons, which, a little too late, they've already launched it everywhere.
[02:52:51.092 --> 02:52:51.432]  Here it is.
[02:52:54.454 --> 02:52:59.417]  Just like any mobile device these days, it has cameras and sensors.
[02:52:59.417 --> 02:53:02.119]  It does facial recognition.
[02:53:02.119 --> 02:53:08.663]  Inside here is three grams of shaped explosive.
[02:53:08.663 --> 02:53:15.908]  This is how it works.
[02:53:15.908 --> 02:53:17.609]  Man, they shot this in a make-believe crowd.
[02:53:21.368 --> 02:53:28.816]  Little bang is enough to penetrate the skull and destroy the content.
[02:53:28.816 --> 02:53:32.681]  What it has roughly is a bullet.
[02:53:32.681 --> 02:53:34.362]  And so it flies up and it shoots you.
[02:53:35.512 --> 02:53:41.017]  And so they're scaring one at the UN, because the UN wants the global power to control this.
[02:53:41.017 --> 02:53:46.321]  So when their peacekeepers show up to kill you, you were never even allowed the basic technology to put up a resistance.
[02:53:46.321 --> 02:53:50.185]  So the evil group is the one that wants to control it for your own good.
[02:53:50.185 --> 02:53:50.605]  No.
[02:53:50.605 --> 02:53:54.609]  Let's continue with the peace.
[02:53:54.609 --> 02:53:59.873]  I want to play more of it, because I saw the full one where it shows them going in and killing the kids in the school.
[02:53:59.873 --> 02:54:00.634]  That was the one I wanted to play.
[02:54:03.908 --> 02:54:22.305]  While we work on that, let me just take a few minutes out here for you and just remind listeners, and it is a reminder, if you don't want to financially support the broadcast, if you don't want to see us expand and face the globalists, if you don't want to see us hire more people and be more aggressive, I don't think that's very good self-preservation activity.
[02:54:22.305 --> 02:54:25.748]  I don't think so.
[02:54:25.748 --> 02:54:29.331]  There isn't an organization or group that's under more attack other than the President.
[02:54:30.885 --> 02:54:32.747]  Drudge is under attack and others are.
[02:54:32.747 --> 02:54:35.889]  We're under attack because we're just talking common sense.
[02:54:35.889 --> 02:54:37.290]  We're having great guests on.
[02:54:37.290 --> 02:54:39.232]  We're having real debates here.
[02:54:39.232 --> 02:54:42.775]  And we're covering topics that they don't want discussed.
[02:54:42.775 --> 02:54:52.182]  So I really hope that everyone will think about going to infowarestore.com and thinking about getting the new shirt that I think is the best we've ever produced.
[02:54:52.182 --> 02:54:55.465]  Really soft, high-quality designer fabric at a low price.
[02:54:55.465 --> 02:54:56.606]  Won't tread on me.
[02:54:56.606 --> 02:54:58.367]  Just the big Gadsden snake.
[02:54:58.367 --> 02:55:00.009]  A American flag on the right-hand shoulder.
[02:55:01.201 --> 02:55:04.508]  Infowars Infowars.com
[02:55:07.169 --> 02:55:08.490]  On the back.
[02:55:08.490 --> 02:55:12.211]  And it's a great way, again, to meet like-minded people, to exercise your free speech.
[02:55:12.211 --> 02:55:18.774]  You'll probably get your dinner bought for you in most areas of the country where people are working and people are good and people are decent.
[02:55:18.774 --> 02:55:31.620]  But if you go to an area like downtown Austin or San Francisco or somewhere else where there's fecal matter all over the ground and heroin heads everywhere and huge disease outbreaks and people vomiting all over each other, they may literally zombie-like attack you.
[02:55:31.620 --> 02:55:34.982]  So again, won't tread on me, the new shirt, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:57.252]  And we've been pioneers of every major subject, the drones, the robotics, the Big Brother, the spy grids, the TVs watching you, the GMO, the fluoride causing brain damage, the vaccines being dangerous by design, the secret EU army, Donna Brazile about to go public against them, the Clintons about to be thrown to the bus, told you that six months ago.
[02:55:57.252 --> 02:56:01.195]  We have vision, we have understanding, we know what we're talking about, we have you as great audience.
[02:56:02.489 --> 02:56:04.531]  That funds us and makes it all possible.
[02:56:04.531 --> 02:56:06.352]  So again, infowarestore.com.
[02:56:06.352 --> 02:56:11.597]  Free shipping is extended on all the items that haven't sold out.
[02:56:11.597 --> 02:56:13.958]  And we've added some new items to the list as well.
[02:56:13.958 --> 02:56:15.260]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:19.103]  Please think about funding us today because I want to really grow in the face of the enemy.
[02:56:19.103 --> 02:56:20.584]  I don't want to let sorrows defeat us.
[02:56:20.584 --> 02:56:22.025]  I don't want to be slowed down.
[02:56:22.025 --> 02:56:22.926]  I don't want to be diminished.
[02:56:22.926 --> 02:56:26.369]  I want to grow and be strong and be 110%.
[02:56:26.369 --> 02:56:29.771]  So here they are giving the UN demonstration of the drone.
[02:56:29.771 --> 02:56:30.072]  Here it is.
[02:56:38.007 --> 02:56:45.851]  Authorities are still struggling to make sense of an attack on university campuses worldwide, which targeted some students and not others.
[02:57:07.521 --> 02:57:10.023]  Who could have done this?
[02:57:10.023 --> 02:57:12.864]  Anyone.
[02:57:12.864 --> 02:57:16.327]  That's the Guardian and the UN and all their propaganda.
[02:57:16.327 --> 02:57:17.868]  So there you go.
[02:57:17.868 --> 02:57:20.369]  I've got one more clip I didn't get to.
[02:57:20.369 --> 02:57:28.634]  How the Vietnamese security firm has hacked into an iPhone X face ID with a mask that cost them a couple dollars.
[02:57:28.634 --> 02:57:35.379]  Yeah, all this technology is designed to be penetrated because the big tech companies are the hackers.
[02:57:36.380 --> 02:57:43.625]  They want to bring in the total grid, have it all implode, then bring in a worldwide biometric ID to buy and sell.
[02:57:43.625 --> 02:57:48.288]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[02:57:48.288 --> 02:57:55.933]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[02:57:55.933 --> 02:58:00.176]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[02:58:00.176 --> 02:58:06.120]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the super blue fluoride free mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:12.884]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[02:58:12.884 --> 02:58:23.270]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[02:58:23.270 --> 02:58:30.073]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[02:58:30.073 --> 02:58:32.635]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[02:58:32.915 --> 02:58:36.536]  Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride-free products.
[02:58:36.536 --> 02:58:41.517]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:41.517 --> 02:58:45.478]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:45.478 --> 02:58:48.619]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:58:48.619 --> 02:58:56.041]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:58:56.041 --> 02:59:01.562]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:59:02.422 --> 02:59:10.093]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:59:10.093 --> 02:59:17.983]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:59:18.664 --> 02:59:23.748]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:59:23.748 --> 02:59:25.889]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:59:25.889 --> 02:59:39.258]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:39.258 --> 02:59:43.241]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:46.875 --> 03:00:05.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.640 --> 03:00:10.341]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.264 --> 03:00:15.886]  This is just in my list of videos today.
[03:00:15.886 --> 03:00:21.329]  Anti-Trump arrested for planning a killing spree of Trump supporters.
[03:00:21.329 --> 03:00:25.991]  Leftists who wanted to kill first responders found an arsenal of bombs and weapons.
[03:00:25.991 --> 03:00:35.736]  Told his parents, who he lived with at 31, that he was going to go out, nothing wrong with living with your parents, but I mean all these people do, were going to go out and kill Trump supporters.
[03:00:35.736 --> 03:00:36.517]  And then I've had
[03:00:37.714 --> 03:00:50.103]  This lady on the broadcast before, transgender activist, libertarian, Blair White, was assaulted on Hollywood Boulevard for sporting a Make America Great Again hat.
[03:00:50.103 --> 03:00:52.305]  A social experiment gone awry.
[03:00:52.305 --> 03:00:57.228]  They also broke her nail, grabbed her hand viciously.
[03:00:57.228 --> 03:00:58.849]  She wanted to see what would happen.
[03:00:58.849 --> 03:01:01.031]  Well, it's like when I go out in one of these areas, they attack me.
[03:01:01.031 --> 03:01:03.413]  And it was two beta males attacking what
[03:01:04.178 --> 03:01:06.419]  You know, you disagree, it's a woman, a man, whatever.
[03:01:06.419 --> 03:01:08.279]  It's an attractive looking woman.
[03:01:08.279 --> 03:01:11.240]  I mean, these are guys thinking they're attacking a woman.
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:13.881]  You can debate whether, you know, she's a man that thinks she's a woman, whatever.
[03:01:13.881 --> 03:01:14.481]  It doesn't matter to me.
[03:01:14.481 --> 03:01:15.482]  I don't hate her.
[03:01:15.482 --> 03:01:17.442]  As long as she doesn't hate me.
[03:01:17.442 --> 03:01:23.204]  And the point is, is that the left then attacks a woman that they don't like.
[03:01:23.204 --> 03:01:23.604]  Here it is.
[03:01:23.604 --> 03:01:31.787]  The radio audience is walking through a busy area, doing nothing, wearing the hat.
[03:01:33.390 --> 03:01:35.392]  Make America great again!
[03:01:35.392 --> 03:01:37.073]  And they're... What do they represent?
[03:01:37.073 --> 03:01:39.455]  Make America... And then she's there with her boyfriend.
[03:01:39.455 --> 03:01:42.977]  All this is for the purposes of a gay couple.
[03:01:42.977 --> 03:01:46.000]  Can't wear their hat.
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.423]  And you've got some guys wearing the... Pussycat hats.
[03:01:50.423 --> 03:01:54.086]  And he... There it is, attacking her.
[03:01:54.086 --> 03:01:56.788]  Grabbing the hat away.
[03:01:56.788 --> 03:02:00.311]  And the police just let him break her nail.
[03:02:00.311 --> 03:02:01.432]  Look at this guy.
[03:02:02.944 --> 03:02:11.808]  I guess she went out there for the fascism march, the pro-fascism march.
[03:02:11.808 --> 03:02:14.549]  So, there you go.
[03:02:14.549 --> 03:02:16.730]  There's the tolerance, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:02:16.730 --> 03:02:18.631]  I mean, again, thinks she's a woman.
[03:02:18.631 --> 03:02:20.792]  There's no doubt they think it's a woman.
[03:02:20.792 --> 03:02:26.774]  I've noticed wheelchair, woman, handicapped person, they attack.
[03:02:26.774 --> 03:02:30.036]  And it's guys wearing pink hats saying, we want to be feminine.
[03:02:30.959 --> 03:02:36.485]  And then they attack, basically, their archetype, a man that's become a woman.
[03:02:36.485 --> 03:02:43.613]  Because she's wearing the wrong hat, they're so tolerant, they'll attack a woman.
[03:02:43.613 --> 03:02:45.495]  Amazing.
[03:02:45.495 --> 03:02:48.278]  Now, I want to move on to this other clip here.
[03:02:48.278 --> 03:02:50.821]  Wow, there's so many, man.
[03:02:52.012 --> 03:02:56.914]  Migrants being sold by Islamists as slaves, but no one points out they're Muslims.
[03:02:56.914 --> 03:02:58.914]  That's CNN.
[03:02:58.914 --> 03:03:00.915]  We've got a bunch of other clips here I didn't get to.
[03:03:00.915 --> 03:03:05.856]  It's just totally insane that it's gotten to this point.
[03:03:05.856 --> 03:03:07.337]  There's so much I didn't get to today.
[03:03:07.337 --> 03:03:12.638]  I've got how the iPhone can be broken into really, really easy.
[03:03:12.638 --> 03:03:15.459]  We don't have time to get to that.
[03:03:15.459 --> 03:03:17.080]  We've got the Sessions testimony.
[03:03:18.834 --> 03:03:21.735]  We've got the Trump rollout that they're promoting in the media.
[03:03:21.735 --> 03:03:23.276]  It's just incredible.
[03:03:23.276 --> 03:03:24.656]  Oh, I know the clip I want to play.
[03:03:24.656 --> 03:03:30.318]  Let's play the clip of the lady that's raised over $75,000 on the GoFundMe site.
[03:03:30.318 --> 03:03:33.159]  Steve Watson wrote about this for Infowars.com.
[03:03:33.159 --> 03:03:39.401]  After she flipped off Trump, she became such a hero for flipping off his motorcade that they've given her $75,000.
[03:03:39.401 --> 03:03:44.243]  And I'm telling you, that's all they can do is attack you or scream, F you.
[03:03:44.243 --> 03:03:45.223]  Here is that clip.
[03:03:45.925 --> 03:03:51.669]  A GoFundMe campaign growing for the cyclist who was fired after flipping off President Trump's motorcade.
[03:03:51.669 --> 03:03:59.754]  More than $70,000 now raised for Julie Briskman, the GoFundMe calling her a quote, inspiration to us all.
[03:03:59.754 --> 03:04:06.639]  Briskman claims that her employer, a government contractor, fired her for violating the company's social media policy.
[03:04:06.639 --> 03:04:08.660]  You know, I say don't even fire somebody like that.
[03:04:08.660 --> 03:04:12.283]  Don't be like the left who fires and physically attacks everybody.
[03:04:12.283 --> 03:04:14.804]  But then, you know, we got to get down to their level sometime, I guess.
[03:04:14.804 --> 03:04:15.165]  But just
[03:04:16.144 --> 03:04:20.952]  How they take their kids up to rallies, too, and just cuss and scream and attack.
[03:04:20.952 --> 03:04:28.665]  And it's just a bunch of spoiled, rotten babies that have lived in this cuddled country forever, who just want to dominate it and want to run our lives.
[03:04:28.665 --> 03:04:29.226]  And I'm sorry.
[03:04:30.626 --> 03:04:33.248]  You're not gonna run our lives, scum.
[03:04:33.248 --> 03:04:35.569]  And if you thought we were asleep before, you were right.
[03:04:35.569 --> 03:04:37.091]  We're awake now.
[03:04:37.091 --> 03:04:41.354]  So, good luck for you to be able to bully the rest of us now that we're awake.
[03:04:41.354 --> 03:04:42.214]  Good luck.
[03:04:42.214 --> 03:04:48.459]  Paul Joseph Watson of PrisonPlanet.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:04:48.459 --> 03:04:49.759]  I'll be with you in 70 seconds.
[03:04:56.638 --> 03:04:58.199]  We're running the biggest specials.
[03:04:58.199 --> 03:05:03.501]  We run them like six months and free shipping, store-wide at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:05:03.501 --> 03:05:07.563]  And when we sell products at this low a price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[03:05:07.563 --> 03:05:12.866]  But I know the products are so good, even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more.
[03:05:12.866 --> 03:05:20.970]  Especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash, or our vitamin mineral fusion, fruit punch drink.
[03:05:20.970 --> 03:05:22.431]  It's got all the amino acids and
[03:05:22.771 --> 03:05:24.972]  Multivitamins are probiotic.
[03:05:24.972 --> 03:05:25.453]  All of it.
[03:05:25.453 --> 03:05:27.254]  Supermill Vitality.
[03:05:27.254 --> 03:05:27.554]  50% off.
[03:05:27.554 --> 03:05:28.455]  Never done that.
[03:05:28.455 --> 03:05:29.235]  And free shipping.
[03:05:29.235 --> 03:05:29.976]  Boom.
[03:05:29.976 --> 03:05:31.417]  Superfillmill Vitality.
[03:05:31.417 --> 03:05:31.957]  50% off.
[03:05:31.957 --> 03:05:32.737]  With free shipping.
[03:05:32.737 --> 03:05:33.238]  Boom.
[03:05:33.238 --> 03:05:34.398]  Biome Defense.
[03:05:34.398 --> 03:05:34.919]  50% off.
[03:05:34.919 --> 03:05:35.959]  With free shipping.
[03:05:35.959 --> 03:05:38.161]  With the free shipping, folks, it's a lost leader.
[03:05:38.161 --> 03:05:41.643]  You sign up for auto ship, we're losing like six, seven dollars on this.
[03:05:41.643 --> 03:05:42.223]  Doesn't matter.
[03:05:42.223 --> 03:05:43.684]  I just want you to see how great it is.
[03:05:43.684 --> 03:05:46.846]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast.
[03:05:46.846 --> 03:05:49.988]  America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[03:05:56.483 --> 03:06:05.311]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:05.311 --> 03:06:07.553]  And Paul Watson, hosting from London, England.
[03:06:07.553 --> 03:06:09.435]  And here he is, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:12.941 --> 03:06:13.501]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:06:13.501 --> 03:06:15.622]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:15.622 --> 03:06:17.463]  We've got a ton of news coming up.
[03:06:17.463 --> 03:06:23.506]  First, I want to start off with a central theme, which is the war on Christmas.
[03:06:23.506 --> 03:06:27.948]  Now, I remember 10, 15 years ago, this is something that Bill O'Reilly, these are the
[03:06:29.002 --> 03:06:35.705]  Neocons would constantly bring up, people would debunk it and say it's a false concern, it's being exaggerated.
[03:06:35.705 --> 03:06:37.185]  There's no war on Christmas.
[03:06:37.185 --> 03:06:38.105]  What are you talking about?
[03:06:38.105 --> 03:06:39.406]  This is crazy.
[03:06:39.406 --> 03:06:41.107]  Well, fast forward to 2017.
[03:06:41.107 --> 03:06:43.948]  Little bit of a different story.
[03:06:43.948 --> 03:06:49.030]  Of course, last week we had the release of the Tesco Christmas ad.
[03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:52.331]  Tesco is basically the UK equivalent of Walmart.
[03:06:52.331 --> 03:06:55.052]  It's the biggest supermarket chain in the country.
[03:06:55.673 --> 03:06:59.844]  One of the biggest corporations in the world, they of course released a Christmas ad.
[03:06:59.844 --> 03:07:02.712]  They called it a Christmas ad, or at least it was supposed to be that.
[03:07:03.479 --> 03:07:07.701]  Didn't have any symbols of Christianity in the ad whatsoever.
[03:07:07.701 --> 03:07:12.864]  It did have a gay couple, hijabi Muslims, all this other goth.
[03:07:12.864 --> 03:07:17.886]  No actual Christian symbol, because of course we can't have that anymore, can we?
[03:07:17.886 --> 03:07:25.530]  You've seen the yogurt products from all these different companies where they have to airbrush out crosses on the top of Christian churches.
[03:07:26.130 --> 03:07:30.293]  Because, God forbid, somebody somewhere might be offended.
[03:07:30.293 --> 03:07:32.415]  There you see the Christmas ad.
[03:07:32.415 --> 03:07:37.679]  Tesco ad that's causing all the controversy in this country over the past week.
[03:07:37.679 --> 03:07:44.324]  Of course, there was a backlash to the backlash, which basically peaked yesterday with Twitter.
[03:07:44.324 --> 03:07:52.730]  Twitter came out and said this was one of their featured stories in their Twitter moments, which of course is on the homepage when anybody goes onto Twitter.
[03:07:53.277 --> 03:07:55.619]  So a ton of people would have seen this.
[03:07:55.619 --> 03:08:00.062]  They said that this was the actual Twitter moment.
[03:08:00.062 --> 03:08:01.343]  I'll read from it.
[03:08:01.343 --> 03:08:06.927]  They said, people are loving the diversity in the Tesco Christmas ad.
[03:08:06.927 --> 03:08:08.509]  This was on the front page of Twitter.
[03:08:08.509 --> 03:08:10.790]  Everybody saw this on Twitter yesterday.
[03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:17.415]  It says, Tesco's Christmas advert features a gay couple and a Muslim family enjoying the season.
[03:08:17.415 --> 03:08:18.196]  Whatever that means.
[03:08:18.945 --> 03:08:30.289]  The advert has drawn mixed reactions, but most viewers... most viewers seem overjoyed... Like, who on earth would be overjoyed by a commercial?
[03:08:30.289 --> 03:08:31.989]  But this is what they said.
[03:08:31.989 --> 03:08:37.111]  Most viewers seem overjoyed at the diverse representation.
[03:08:37.111 --> 03:08:37.351]  Okay.
[03:08:38.180 --> 03:08:40.263]  That is fake news.
[03:08:40.263 --> 03:08:42.065]  In fact, I tweeted about it.
[03:08:42.065 --> 03:08:48.873]  You go onto the YouTube version of this Christmas ad, this new Tesco Christmas ad, 4,000 thumbs down, 1,000 thumbs up.
[03:08:52.125 --> 03:08:55.727]  A 4 to 1 thumbs down to thumbs up ratio.
[03:08:55.727 --> 03:08:59.029]  That does not mean people are loving it.
[03:08:59.029 --> 03:09:00.509]  That's a complete lie.
[03:09:00.509 --> 03:09:02.530]  That is fake news.
[03:09:02.530 --> 03:09:04.511]  Certainly doesn't mean that anybody's overjoyed by it.
[03:09:04.511 --> 03:09:05.172]  Look at that.
[03:09:05.172 --> 03:09:07.633]  It's down 6 to 3k now.
[03:09:07.633 --> 03:09:09.494]  So they've managed to get it up a little bit.
[03:09:09.494 --> 03:09:11.935]  Only 6,000 thumbs down to 3.
[03:09:11.935 --> 03:09:15.077]  So now it's 2 to 1.
[03:09:15.077 --> 03:09:16.438]  But is that being overjoyed?
[03:09:16.438 --> 03:09:17.958]  Is that people loving the ad?
[03:09:17.958 --> 03:09:18.479]  No.
[03:09:18.479 --> 03:09:21.080]  The vast majority of people don't like it.
[03:09:21.778 --> 03:09:24.043]  There have been newspaper articles about it all week.
[03:09:24.043 --> 03:09:26.508]  Well, Paul, this is cultural appropriation!
[03:09:26.508 --> 03:09:31.519]  This is what the left's all about, is overriding, taking control of everything, dominating culture!
[03:09:32.967 --> 03:09:34.668]  Well, Alex, it doesn't even make sense.
[03:09:34.668 --> 03:09:37.330]  Muslims don't celebrate Christmas.
[03:09:37.330 --> 03:09:40.652]  All the headlines are like, oh, you're so offended at seeing Muslims.
[03:09:40.652 --> 03:09:57.063]  It's like, no, I'm offended at the fact, or I'm perplexed at the fact there's no... It'd be like if you had an ad saying, this holiday season, support Ramadan at your local halal stores, and then it showed guys in Knights Templar uniforms at the Muslim store, buying goat breads.
[03:09:58.186 --> 03:10:00.148]  And they're like, oh, why are you so offended by me?
[03:10:00.148 --> 03:10:01.149]  Nobody really cares.
[03:10:01.149 --> 03:10:04.072]  Just, at least, like, put a vicar in it or something.
[03:10:04.072 --> 03:10:05.153]  A cross.
[03:10:05.153 --> 03:10:06.394]  Anything Christian.
[03:10:06.394 --> 03:10:08.356]  It's a Christmas ad, for God's sake.
[03:10:08.356 --> 03:10:09.177]  But here's the kicker.
[03:10:09.177 --> 03:10:13.321]  It's like having a Christmas ad where you drag Santa Claus behind a car.
[03:10:13.321 --> 03:10:16.665]  Yeah, I went into Tesco on Saturday.
[03:10:16.665 --> 03:10:18.927]  Went to the Christmas section of the store.
[03:10:19.733 --> 03:10:21.535]  Not one mention of Christmas.
[03:10:21.535 --> 03:10:23.676]  They don't even mention the word Christmas.
[03:10:23.676 --> 03:10:25.998]  They've got these Christmas cards, Alex.
[03:10:25.998 --> 03:10:27.980]  They call them, they've renamed them.
[03:10:27.980 --> 03:10:30.301]  They're now called charity cards.
[03:10:30.301 --> 03:10:33.144]  Paul, you gotta go back in and get some footage of this.
[03:10:34.053 --> 03:10:40.201]  Well, I've got the pictures and I tweeted them, but people said, oh, that's because a portion of the proceeds are donated to charity.
[03:10:40.201 --> 03:10:44.486]  Yeah, that's always been the case, but they were called Christmas cards, OK?
[03:10:44.486 --> 03:10:48.331]  They've changed the name of Christmas cards to charity cards.
[03:10:48.331 --> 03:10:50.013]  And this is in one store, OK?
[03:10:50.013 --> 03:10:51.495]  So all these people who, oh,
[03:10:52.336 --> 03:10:56.838]  You know, I went to a Tesco store in a completely different part of the country and found the word Christmas.
[03:10:56.838 --> 03:10:58.659]  Yeah, I'm not talking about that.
[03:10:58.659 --> 03:11:00.560]  I'm talking about the store that I went in.
[03:11:00.560 --> 03:11:01.900]  They had crackers.
[03:11:01.900 --> 03:11:04.021]  It said six crackers.
[03:11:04.021 --> 03:11:06.182]  They don't call them Christmas crackers anymore.
[03:11:06.182 --> 03:11:13.005]  They had a ton of confectionery, chocolate, sweets, that didn't say Christmas anywhere on the packaging.
[03:11:13.005 --> 03:11:15.546]  They're deliberately excising out the word Christmas.
[03:11:15.546 --> 03:11:17.447]  They are memory-holing Christmas.
[03:11:17.447 --> 03:11:18.628]  They are banning the word.
[03:11:20.069 --> 03:11:24.173]  Yeah, and it's obviously a lame nod to political correctness.
[03:11:24.173 --> 03:11:26.414]  It's not this, oh, everyone's welcome.
[03:11:26.414 --> 03:11:27.776]  That's how they sell it, Alex.
[03:11:27.776 --> 03:11:28.977]  Everyone's welcome.
[03:11:28.977 --> 03:11:31.399]  No, Muslims don't care about Christmas.
[03:11:31.399 --> 03:11:33.000]  They don't celebrate it.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.983]  And they're not going to get offended if you don't put them in a Christmas ad.
[03:11:35.983 --> 03:11:43.449]  This is a bunch of guilty, self-guilt-tripping white people on the far left who are doing this, and they're literally undermining our culture.
[03:11:44.091 --> 03:11:50.123]  Now, I mean, this is not some kind of Bill O'Reilly meme from the early 2000s anymore.
[03:11:50.123 --> 03:11:51.305]  This is actually happening.
[03:11:52.029 --> 03:11:57.732]  There's a headline up on The Guardian, threats to boycott Tesco after Muslim family features in Christmas ad.
[03:11:57.732 --> 03:12:07.778]  Again, completely misrepresenting the source of the controversy, which was the fact there were no Christian symbols in the entire ad for Christmas.
[03:12:07.778 --> 03:12:19.925]  Just like the yoghurt companies, the big yoghurt companies have shot it out, they've airbrushed out the crosses on top of the Christian churches when they sell their products, because God forbid it might offend somebody.
[03:12:19.925 --> 03:12:21.526]  This is a deliberate Orwellian
[03:12:22.423 --> 03:12:30.007]  Process of eliminating words, changing language for the purposes of some lame nod at political correctness.
[03:12:30.007 --> 03:12:33.609]  And it's chilling, and we should be angry about this.
[03:12:33.609 --> 03:12:43.654]  And yeah, there are some Tesco stores across the country which will have some things that say Christmas, but they're gradually airbrushing it out, and it's insidious.
[03:12:43.654 --> 03:12:44.575]  Here's another headline.
[03:12:45.330 --> 03:12:49.513]  Again, proving that the war on Christmas is not some right-wing conspiracy theory.
[03:12:49.513 --> 03:12:57.240]  Voice of Europe reports, Paris cancels Christmas market, holds special Ramadan party every year.
[03:12:57.240 --> 03:13:01.063]  Now this is a Christmas market in Paris that I've been to on several occasions.
[03:13:01.063 --> 03:13:04.706]  Massive cultural icon of a festivity.
[03:13:06.067 --> 03:13:07.528]  No longer going to exist.
[03:13:07.528 --> 03:13:10.310]  The Champs-Élysées Christmas Market in Paris.
[03:13:10.310 --> 03:13:16.474]  Champs-Élysées, central Paris, iconic area, has been cancelled by City Hall councillors.
[03:13:16.474 --> 03:13:23.359]  It's considered the city's main Christmas market and welcomes 15 million visitors every year.
[03:13:23.359 --> 03:13:25.201]  Hugely successful.
[03:13:25.201 --> 03:13:26.622]  Globally renowned.
[03:13:26.622 --> 03:13:27.042]  It's gone.
[03:13:27.654 --> 03:13:43.886]  According to a spokesperson of the City Hall, the French capital wants to focus on offering visitors and Parisians more attractive and innovative events that will enhance the Champs-Élysées in a cultural and aesthetic dimension in keeping with this exceptional site.
[03:13:43.886 --> 03:13:46.427]  Oh, so you're all bothered about aesthetics.
[03:13:46.427 --> 03:13:53.653]  Meanwhile, you're literally building a wall around the Eiffel Tower because Islam is such a massive religion of peace.
[03:13:53.653 --> 03:13:55.214]  Oh, but now you care about aesthetics.
[03:13:55.214 --> 03:13:55.454]  Okay.
[03:13:56.368 --> 03:14:03.733]  Since 2008, this market in Paris has been organised by Marcel Campion, but due to long-term dispute, the contract was terminated this year.
[03:14:03.733 --> 03:14:10.338]  According to Jean-Francois Martin, Deputy Mayor in charge of Tourism, the market wasn't good enough for Paris.
[03:14:10.338 --> 03:14:18.984]  So they've cancelled this, but of course, the daily street prayers, where they literally have a call to prayer at 5am and go and kneel on the street, that will continue.
[03:14:20.177 --> 03:14:21.137]  Another one.
[03:14:21.137 --> 03:14:26.560]  French top court bans Christian nativity scenes from public spaces.
[03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:27.801]  Christmas nativity scenes.
[03:14:27.801 --> 03:14:38.986]  The French Council of State has ruled for a ban on Christmas nativity scenes in public spaces unless special circumstances show that this has a cultural, artistic or festive purpose.
[03:14:39.719 --> 03:14:50.842]  So you can't just have a Christmas festivity nativity scene in public for the sake of, oh, I don't know, we're a Christian country, this is the very foundation of our entire society.
[03:14:50.842 --> 03:14:52.663]  No, that's not a good enough reason.
[03:14:52.663 --> 03:14:59.484]  You have to prove that it's diverse enough, that it's representative enough, culturally, and we're going to ban it.
[03:14:59.484 --> 03:15:01.405]  Because you can't prove that.
[03:15:01.405 --> 03:15:05.326]  The decision of the Council of State relates to the nativity scene that the Mayor of Béziers
[03:15:06.414 --> 03:15:10.435]  Robert Menard had installed in 2014.
[03:15:10.435 --> 03:15:16.457]  In 2015-16, a crash was again installed, but with a more cultural and festive dimension.
[03:15:16.457 --> 03:15:21.558]  Because you can't just- you can't just have a Christian nativity scene with a baby Jesus and whatever.
[03:15:21.558 --> 03:15:21.798]  No.
[03:15:21.798 --> 03:15:23.678]  No, that's- that might offend somebody.
[03:15:23.678 --> 03:15:24.219]  Ban it!
[03:15:24.219 --> 03:15:26.039]  Ban it!
[03:15:26.039 --> 03:15:27.619]  It was accompanied by a Christmas tree.
[03:15:27.619 --> 03:15:28.280]  Can't have that.
[03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:28.960]  Ban that.
[03:15:28.960 --> 03:15:31.280]  And a mailbox to write Santa Claus.
[03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:33.381]  So even like the non-Christian stuff,
[03:15:34.048 --> 03:15:38.732]  There's more commercial stuff than Santa Claus, the Christmas tree or whatever, which is actually pagan.
[03:15:38.732 --> 03:15:39.313]  Even that!
[03:15:39.313 --> 03:15:40.994]  They're even banning that!
[03:15:40.994 --> 03:15:43.036]  Because it might offend somebody, okay?
[03:15:45.427 --> 03:15:46.047]  Here's another one.
[03:15:46.047 --> 03:15:46.848]  This was last year.
[03:15:46.848 --> 03:15:48.349]  And we're going to see more of this.
[03:15:48.349 --> 03:15:49.550]  I'll get into it after the break.
[03:15:49.550 --> 03:15:51.852]  This is the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.

[03:18:07.937 --> 03:18:14.121]  The truck got in this morning, and it's back, but it is a limited run because of all the testing and all the rest of it.
[03:18:14.121 --> 03:18:15.282]  It's the highest quality.

[03:18:17.283 --> 03:18:18.144]  It is amazing.

[03:18:32.872 --> 03:18:34.472]  DNA Force and Bomb Defense.
[03:18:34.472 --> 03:18:35.293]  Probiotic.
[03:18:35.293 --> 03:18:36.153]  Now back in stock.
[03:18:36.153 --> 03:18:37.293]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:18:37.293 --> 03:18:41.134]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[03:18:41.134 --> 03:18:42.774]  It is an act of war.
[03:18:42.774 --> 03:18:44.315]  It is an act of standing up.
[03:18:44.315 --> 03:18:49.876]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[03:18:52.110 --> 03:19:12.097]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWareStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:19:12.097 --> 03:19:14.218]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:19:14.218 --> 03:19:17.939]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:19:17.939 --> 03:19:19.240]  I don't want to thank everybody that has,
[03:19:19.360 --> 03:19:25.365]  But we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine.
[03:19:25.365 --> 03:19:27.846]  And you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:19:27.846 --> 03:19:30.489]  We've got the best mouthwash signed by Dr. Jones.
[03:19:30.489 --> 03:19:31.389]  That's my dad.
[03:19:31.389 --> 03:19:33.291]  With colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:19:33.291 --> 03:19:35.572]  Infowarslife.com or AAA253-3139.
[03:19:37.774 --> 03:19:39.356]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:06.082 --> 03:20:12.769]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:12.769 --> 03:20:16.453]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:20.213 --> 03:20:22.394]  It doesn't even matter if you're a Christian or not.
[03:20:22.394 --> 03:20:42.124]  The fact is, if you want to subvert, undermine, and eventually overthrow Western civilization, which is what the far left wants to do, even though many of them don't know it, they're useful idiots, then you've got to take down Christianity because it's the fundamental underpinning of Western society.
[03:20:42.124 --> 03:20:46.806]  This is the process that we see right now with the encroachment of Islam.
[03:20:46.806 --> 03:20:49.928]  Not just radical Islam, but mass Islamic immigration.
[03:20:51.084 --> 03:20:59.270]  And yet, in most cases, those who are supposedly, we're told, might be offended by any of this, they're not even offended, they don't even care!
[03:20:59.270 --> 03:21:02.071]  It's other people getting offended on their behalf.
[03:21:02.071 --> 03:21:04.133]  We've seen it with the yoghurt companies.
[03:21:04.133 --> 03:21:11.378]  Lidl, Nestle, airbrushing Christian Crosses from the yoghurt packaging.
[03:21:11.378 --> 03:21:14.580]  I mean, most people wouldn't even notice it anyway.
[03:21:14.580 --> 03:21:19.183]  If you go to my Twitter, I just retweeted an example of that, a before and after shot.
[03:21:19.855 --> 03:21:22.616]  It's the church in Greece.
[03:21:22.616 --> 03:21:26.037]  They've airbrushed it out because it had a cross on top of the church.
[03:21:26.037 --> 03:21:27.377]  For yoghurt.
[03:21:27.377 --> 03:21:28.837]  For yoghurt.
[03:21:28.837 --> 03:21:29.537]  There you see it.
[03:21:29.537 --> 03:21:31.318]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:21:31.318 --> 03:21:36.939]  So Tesco's come out with this Christmas ad that has no Christian symbols in it whatsoever.
[03:21:36.939 --> 03:21:40.860]  The media took that, spun it and said, oh, look at all these bigots.
[03:21:40.860 --> 03:21:44.121]  Offended because there were some hijabi Muslims in the advert.
[03:21:44.838 --> 03:21:46.681]  No, that's not the point.
[03:21:46.681 --> 03:21:49.584]  The point is, why are you putting Muslims in a Christmas advert?
[03:21:49.584 --> 03:21:50.986]  They don't celebrate Christmas.
[03:21:50.986 --> 03:21:51.767]  They don't care.
[03:21:51.767 --> 03:21:56.233]  Number two, where are the Christian symbols?
[03:21:56.233 --> 03:21:59.878]  Alright, you've got gay dads in there, fair enough, whatever.
[03:21:59.878 --> 03:22:01.580]  At least put a cross in there.
[03:22:01.580 --> 03:22:02.201]  I mean, come on.
[03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:08.193]  And then Twitter comes out and outright lies and says, people are loving the diversity in the new Tesco ad.
[03:22:08.193 --> 03:22:13.657]  Gone YouTube, 6,000 thumbs down as of now compared to 3,000 thumbs up.
[03:22:13.657 --> 03:22:15.458]  No, people are not loving it.
[03:22:15.458 --> 03:22:18.900]  The clear majority of people hate it.
[03:22:18.900 --> 03:22:25.144]  Because they see this gradual Orwellian erosion of tradition, of culture, of language.
[03:22:25.144 --> 03:22:26.025]  And it's insidious.
[03:22:27.077 --> 03:22:31.540]  It's no longer some Bill O'Reilly meme when it's actually happening.
[03:22:31.540 --> 03:22:35.722]  France has banned nativity scenes in public spaces.
[03:22:35.722 --> 03:22:39.485]  We had this story last year out of the Express, out of Germany.
[03:22:39.485 --> 03:22:42.546]  It's going to be replicated even more so again this year.
[03:22:42.546 --> 03:22:53.273]  Remember, this was around the time that an Islamic terrorist migrant barreled a truck through a Christmas market in Berlin, killing what, over a dozen people, injuring dozens more?
[03:22:54.924 --> 03:22:56.705]  These are who we're capitulating to.
[03:22:56.705 --> 03:23:00.847]  This is the great capitulation we're witnessing right now.
[03:23:00.847 --> 03:23:06.550]  Christmas banned from being mentioned on menu over fears it would offend Muslims.
[03:23:06.550 --> 03:23:13.754]  Christmas treats have been taken off the menu and replaced with winter delicacies over fears the phrase would offend Muslims.
[03:23:13.754 --> 03:23:20.738]  Function held at the Austrian Embassy in Germany still served traditionals festive fare but rebranded them as winter delicacies.
[03:23:20.738 --> 03:23:21.859]  So you can't even serve
[03:23:22.887 --> 03:23:26.329]  Food that's called Christmas.
[03:23:26.329 --> 03:23:28.070]  Because it might offend a Muslim.
[03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:32.031]  You know, like the San Bernardino killers were offended by the Christmas party.
[03:23:32.031 --> 03:23:35.313]  We don't want to offend those kind of people, do we?
[03:23:35.313 --> 03:23:36.854]  Here's another one.
[03:23:36.854 --> 03:23:38.655]  Out of Germany again.
[03:23:38.655 --> 03:23:40.595]  We are a Muslim business.
[03:23:40.595 --> 03:23:43.517]  Woolworths store cancels Christmas over Islamic customers.
[03:23:44.156 --> 03:23:50.061]  Woolworths has cancelled Christmas in one of its German stores after claiming its only remaining customers are Muslim.
[03:23:50.061 --> 03:23:55.325]  The former High Street favourite went bust seven years ago in the UK but still operates 300 stores in Germany.
[03:23:55.325 --> 03:24:07.255]  And a row broke out after staff at a branch in Dortmund decided not to bother with Christmas decorations, gifts or music this year because it's now essentially a Muslim store.
[03:24:07.255 --> 03:24:12.900]  Shocked locals found out after the Christmas section, which featured decorations, gifts and festive treats,
[03:24:13.519 --> 03:24:16.000]  Such as chocolate for the Christmases.
[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:18.602]  Don't call it Father Christmas!
[03:24:18.602 --> 03:24:21.443]  Was removed after just a few days on display.
[03:24:21.443 --> 03:24:24.625]  So that was because it was essentially in a Muslim ghetto.
[03:24:24.625 --> 03:24:26.766]  They just got rid of it.
[03:24:26.766 --> 03:24:30.488]  I mean, perhaps Tesco shouldn't really be having
[03:24:31.235 --> 03:24:32.696]  Christmas sections at all.
[03:24:32.696 --> 03:24:37.077]  They shouldn't be selling Christmas cards or charity cards as they're called now.
[03:24:37.077 --> 03:24:38.777]  They shouldn't be selling crackers.
[03:24:38.777 --> 03:24:42.939]  They shouldn't be selling wrapping paper that might offend a Muslim.
[03:24:42.939 --> 03:24:45.920]  Decorations, tinsel, baubles that might offend somebody.
[03:24:45.920 --> 03:24:51.882]  I think I'm starting to get triggered by the fact that they've even got a Christmas section.
[03:24:51.882 --> 03:24:54.583]  I mean think of the precious Muslims.
[03:24:54.583 --> 03:24:55.463]  You might offend them.
[03:24:56.320 --> 03:24:59.522]  In fact, that's actually a narrative that we've seen from the left.
[03:24:59.522 --> 03:25:03.484]  Don't offend the Muslims, it might turn them into terrorists.
[03:25:03.484 --> 03:25:04.905]  What?!
[03:25:04.905 --> 03:25:15.611]  First of all, that's the most Islamophobic thing you could ever say, because it's introducing the premise that you can just turn a Muslim into a terrorist by making them upset.
[03:25:16.155 --> 03:25:20.776]  Which kind of gives you a clue that it's quite easy for them to become terrorists in the first place.
[03:25:20.776 --> 03:25:22.057]  Very bigoted.
[03:25:22.057 --> 03:25:23.557]  Very islamophobic.
[03:25:23.557 --> 03:25:27.018]  As is, Christmas sections all in supermarkets.
[03:25:27.018 --> 03:25:28.138]  Get rid of them all.
[03:25:28.138 --> 03:25:29.238]  Ban everything.
[03:25:29.238 --> 03:25:30.639]  Ban Christmas trees.
[03:25:30.639 --> 03:25:31.959]  Ban Santa Claus.
[03:25:31.959 --> 03:25:34.480]  Someone might be offended.
[03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:35.380]  And if you've got a video,
[03:25:36.463 --> 03:25:40.726]  On YouTube of a Christmas ad without any Christian symbols in it like Tesco does.
[03:25:40.726 --> 03:25:44.888]  And it's got 6,000 thumbs down compared to only 3,000 thumbs up.
[03:25:44.888 --> 03:25:46.590]  Just say everybody's loving it.
[03:25:46.590 --> 03:25:51.693]  Just lie through your teeth on the front page of Twitter and say everybody loves it.
[03:25:51.693 --> 03:25:52.653]  It's so diverse.
[03:25:52.653 --> 03:25:53.714]  Everybody's loving it.
[03:25:53.714 --> 03:25:54.535]  They're overjoyed.
[03:25:54.535 --> 03:25:56.096]  That was the word they literally used.
[03:25:56.096 --> 03:25:58.197]  Twitter said people were overjoyed.
[03:25:58.197 --> 03:25:59.618]  Yeah, 6,000 thumbs down.
[03:25:59.618 --> 03:26:02.860]  That's literally fake news, okay?
[03:26:04.136 --> 03:26:11.782]  That is the war on Christmas, I'm sure we'll be talking about it again, given the fact that it's only November the 14th.
[03:26:11.782 --> 03:26:23.751]  Before we get back into this news, I want to tell you, though, how you can support InfoWars this Christmas and stock up on great products by taking advantage of extended free shipping.

[03:27:56.575 --> 03:28:11.509]  Don't forget, Brain Force Plus, the mainstream media, the verified libtards on Twitter had an absolute meltdown over that last weekend because they found an ad in which I had made a commercial for Brain Force Plus.
[03:28:12.427 --> 03:28:15.748]  Six months ago, they found it and they're like, oh my god, what's this?
[03:28:15.748 --> 03:28:17.369]  We've just discovered this!
[03:28:17.369 --> 03:28:19.069]  Yeah, six months old.
[03:28:19.069 --> 03:28:28.732]  God forbid I was advertising a nootropic product that's taken by like half the people in Silicon Valley, that's proven to help with cognitive functioning.
[03:28:28.732 --> 03:28:30.753]  Brain Force Plus.
[03:28:30.753 --> 03:28:38.175]  Nothing triggers them more than you stocking up on Brain Force Plus right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:28:38.175 --> 03:28:41.376]  Gonna talk about Barbie's first hijab after the break.

[03:28:45.464 --> 03:28:45.965]  Now go away.
[03:28:51.738 --> 03:28:54.380]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[03:28:54.380 --> 03:28:55.381]  That's true.
[03:28:55.381 --> 03:29:00.445]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?

[03:32:43.300 --> 03:32:49.644]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[03:32:55.396 --> 03:33:09.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.440 --> 03:33:16.522]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.522 --> 03:33:20.243]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:24.289 --> 03:33:26.612]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.612 --> 03:33:38.745]  I'm going to go to a video now which just went up on Infowars.com about an hour ago which I put out about this transgender individual who's also claiming that he's transracial.
[03:33:38.745 --> 03:33:39.726]  This is a white guy.
[03:33:39.726 --> 03:33:42.670]  This is a chubby, pasty white guy.
[03:33:43.467 --> 03:33:48.410]  Born a man, he's not even making the effort to look like a woman, although he claims he's transgender.
[03:33:48.410 --> 03:33:52.373]  He also claims that he's transracial and that he's Filipino.
[03:33:52.373 --> 03:34:03.720]  He's made decidedly less effort to be transracial compared to Rachel Dolezal, who of course the mainstream media came out and elements of it celebrated her.
[03:34:03.720 --> 03:34:11.305]  Melissa Harris Perry, as you'll see in this clip, got up on MSNBC and said, yeah, I think it is possible for people to just become black.
[03:34:11.917 --> 03:34:17.300]  Even if they were born white with ginger hair, just, you know, because they feel black.
[03:34:17.300 --> 03:34:19.882]  They actually signed on to some of that insanity.
[03:34:19.882 --> 03:34:22.504]  And this is taking it to a new level.
[03:34:22.504 --> 03:34:27.187]  This is the transgender guy who thinks he's a Filipino.
[03:34:27.187 --> 03:34:27.647]  Here's the clip.
[03:34:28.874 --> 03:34:31.356]  This man says he's transracial.
[03:34:31.356 --> 03:34:33.217]  Oh God, not this again.
[03:34:33.217 --> 03:34:40.641]  This milky white tub of lard born Adam says he now identifies as a Filipino woman called Jardou.
[03:34:40.641 --> 03:34:46.225]  Whenever I'm around the music, I'm around the food, I feel like I'm in my own skin.
[03:34:46.225 --> 03:34:50.247]  Yeah, you're about as Filipino as Rachel Dolezal is African American.
[03:34:50.247 --> 03:34:51.128]  Are you African American?
[03:34:55.089 --> 03:34:58.110]  And who was born white, but believes that he is Filipino.
[03:34:58.110 --> 03:35:00.491]  There are just so many questions here.
[03:35:00.491 --> 03:35:01.691]  You're the news!
[03:35:01.691 --> 03:35:04.352]  Why are you treating this as a real news story?
[03:35:04.352 --> 03:35:05.532]  What's wrong with you?
[03:35:05.532 --> 03:35:06.512]  So many questions here.
[03:35:06.512 --> 03:35:07.772]  But wait, it gets worse.
[03:35:07.772 --> 03:35:18.975]  They talked to a psychologist, who instead of having a normal reaction, you know, laughing uncontrollably for minutes on end, actually legitimized this moron's feverish delusion.
[03:35:18.975 --> 03:35:20.436]  Are they hurting you?
[03:35:21.644 --> 03:35:23.705]  Are they hurting anyone else?
[03:35:23.705 --> 03:35:25.926]  Are they hurting themselves?
[03:35:25.926 --> 03:35:30.328]  And are they just trying to be who they feel they are inside?
[03:35:30.328 --> 03:35:31.268]  They're gonna be happier.
[03:35:31.268 --> 03:35:35.030]  Okay, so I've decided that I'm a black single mother with eight children.
[03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:37.371]  Can I take advantage of affirmative action?
[03:35:37.371 --> 03:35:38.392]  Can I get welfare?
[03:35:38.392 --> 03:35:41.493]  I mean, this is who I feel I am on the inside and I'm not hurting
[03:35:41.493 --> 03:35:43.454]  I'd watch the History Channel sometimes for hours.
[03:36:19.758 --> 03:36:27.282]  You know, I had to make sure that it wasn't just me, because if it's just me, then there must be something wrong, or maybe I'm just, maybe I'm just strange.
[03:36:27.282 --> 03:36:30.344]  Yeah, if we can agree on one thing, mate, it's that you're strange.
[03:36:30.344 --> 03:36:38.469]  But hey, when you've got pundits on actual mainstream news shows saying that you can just become black if you feel like it, then all bets are off.
[03:36:38.609 --> 03:36:43.712]  But is it possible that she might actually be black?
[03:36:43.712 --> 03:36:49.797]  There is actually a different category of blackness that is about the achievement of blackness despite one's parentage.
[03:36:49.797 --> 03:36:51.298]  Is that possible?
[03:36:51.298 --> 03:36:52.619]  It's absolutely possible.
[03:36:52.619 --> 03:36:56.481]  So if I wear a sombrero on Halloween, I'm guilty of cultural appropriation.
[03:36:56.481 --> 03:37:00.604]  But if I just start walking around claiming to be Mexican, that's okay.
[03:37:00.604 --> 03:37:05.888]  This is the bed you progressives have made with this everything-is-a-social-construct crap.
[03:37:06.548 --> 03:37:07.809]  So it's time to lie in it.
[03:37:07.809 --> 03:37:21.941]  If you're going to claim that men can have babies, that gender is fluid, and a person's gender identity may change over their lifetime, that infants shouldn't be assigned a sex at birth, if you're going to claim that biological science no longer matters, and that we're all
[03:37:23.661 --> 03:37:27.303]  Then you can't argue against this freak's claim that she's a reptile.
[03:37:27.303 --> 03:37:31.544]  You can't argue against this weirdo's claim that he's a six-year-old girl.
[03:37:31.544 --> 03:37:34.785]  You can't argue against this idiot's claim that he's Filipino.
[03:37:34.785 --> 03:37:37.526]  Embrace it, because you're responsible for all this insanity.
[03:37:37.526 --> 03:37:37.927]  Time to own it.
[03:37:55.014 --> 03:38:01.218]  This man says he's trans... That is the video that just went up on Infowars.com earlier.
[03:38:01.218 --> 03:38:02.939]  Get it out there.
[03:38:02.939 --> 03:38:04.199]  Of course.
[03:38:04.199 --> 03:38:09.983]  If you're gonna start off on the premise of everything being a social construct, you're gonna run into trouble.
[03:38:09.983 --> 03:38:15.966]  And now you're running into big trouble with these people claiming that they pour Drano cleaner in their eyes to be trendy.
[03:38:16.827 --> 03:38:19.069]  That that's just what they identify as.
[03:38:19.069 --> 03:38:20.710]  Don't you dare call it a mental illness.
[03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:23.812]  If that's what makes them happy, don't be a bigot.
[03:38:23.812 --> 03:38:24.212]  Okay?
[03:38:24.212 --> 03:38:26.154]  You own that narrative now.
[03:38:26.154 --> 03:38:27.615]  Well done.
[03:38:27.615 --> 03:38:30.837]  CNN reports, Barbie's first hijab.
[03:38:30.837 --> 03:38:33.619]  Meet the new Ibaj Muhammad doll.
[03:38:34.344 --> 03:38:44.069]  Mattel, which makes Barbie, announced Monday that the latest doll in its Shiro collection will be modelled after Olympic fencer Ibaj Muhammad.
[03:38:44.069 --> 03:38:49.332]  In 2016, Muhammad became the first American to compete in the Games while wearing a hijab.
[03:38:49.332 --> 03:38:56.256]  She said, I'm proud to know that little girls everywhere can now play with a Barbie who chooses to wear hijab.
[03:38:56.256 --> 03:38:57.897]  This is a childhood dream come true.
[03:38:58.911 --> 03:39:01.633]  The news was announced at Glamour's Women of the Year Summit.
[03:39:01.633 --> 03:39:03.834]  The doll will go on sale in 2018.
[03:39:03.834 --> 03:39:10.258]  Barbie has been working hard to make sure its collection of dolls are more diverse in an effort to broaden the brand's appeal.
[03:39:11.917 --> 03:39:15.838]  Now, where did this hijab Barbie idea originate from?
[03:39:15.838 --> 03:39:18.638]  Did it originate from this Olympic athlete?
[03:39:18.638 --> 03:39:22.879]  No, it originated from feminists because we reported on it before that.
[03:39:22.879 --> 03:39:36.421]  They were pressuring Mattel into creating a hijab Barbie because, again, they were basically fearful of Trump's election and thought that it would herald a new Islamophobic purge in America.
[03:39:36.421 --> 03:39:39.182]  Of course, nothing like that has happened.
[03:39:39.182 --> 03:39:40.682]  But again, this came from feminists.
[03:39:41.505 --> 03:39:55.301]  Didn't come from Muslim groups, it came from predominantly white feminist leftist groups who have sided with Islam, despite the fact that Islam is the most misogynistic sexist belief system on the planet.
[03:39:55.301 --> 03:39:56.262]  And by the way, that's what
[03:39:57.666 --> 03:40:12.607]  Arab feminist groups a hundred years ago thought, because it was the Egyptian Feminist Union, one of the first feminist groups in existence in that part of the world, that discarded their hijabs as a form of protest.
[03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:20.213]  So the very first Muslim Arab feminist group in the Middle East discarded their hijabs.
[03:40:20.213 --> 03:40:21.673]  Let that sink in.
[03:40:21.673 --> 03:40:25.835]  A hundred years ago, they knew it was a symbol of oppression.
[03:40:25.835 --> 03:40:34.518]  A hundred years later, CNN and all the rest of these dominant cultural institutions are presenting it as a symbol of feminism.
[03:40:36.644 --> 03:40:59.460]  Coming as it does from the same part of the world that literally gave birth to something called The Rape Game, which of course we saw in Egypt with Laura Logan, and which of course we've seen imported into the West on the wave of Islamic immigration, which has brought with it skyrocketing sexual assault figures and the mass molestation of women in major cities like Cologne.
[03:40:59.460 --> 03:41:03.543]  Of course, what did the feminists do in Cologne the day after the event, the day after
[03:41:04.341 --> 03:41:08.823]  What, 1,000 predominantly Moroccan Muslim migrants molested 2,000 women?
[03:41:08.823 --> 03:41:10.284]  What did the feminists do?
[03:41:10.284 --> 03:41:13.926]  Did they protest against the migrants for importing their rape culture?
[03:41:13.926 --> 03:41:14.366]  No.
[03:41:14.366 --> 03:41:20.229]  They went down to the local migrant centre and gave the migrants flowers.
[03:41:20.229 --> 03:41:23.830]  That's how the feminists responded to the mass molestation of women.
[03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:24.931]  Oh, and by the way, you know what?
[03:41:25.834 --> 03:41:31.156]  Muslim Syrian women do in areas of Syria that have been liberated from ISIS.
[03:41:31.156 --> 03:41:32.557]  What's the first thing they do?
[03:41:32.557 --> 03:41:40.240]  They discard their hijab because ISIS enforces stringent rules on Islamic headwear.
[03:41:40.240 --> 03:41:45.062]  They make everybody wear a burqa, at least, if not the full face covering.
[03:41:45.062 --> 03:41:48.323]  They discard the veils when they're liberated from ISIS.
[03:41:48.323 --> 03:41:54.286]  But CNN, feminists, all these dominant cultural institutions want you to believe it's trendy.
[03:41:54.286 --> 03:41:55.246]  All right, don't listen to me.
[03:41:56.184 --> 03:42:00.785]  Listen to Azra Q. Nomani, the founder of the Muslim Reform Movement.
[03:42:00.785 --> 03:42:12.008]  She wrote that the hijab is, quote, a symbol of a dangerous purity culture obsessed with honor and virginity that has divided Muslim communities in our own civil war.
[03:42:12.008 --> 03:42:13.408]  Again, this is not me saying this.
[03:42:13.408 --> 03:42:15.949]  This is the head of the Muslim Reform Movement.
[03:42:16.818 --> 03:42:28.023]  Since the Saudi and Iranian regimes promulgated puritanical interpretations of Sunni and Shia Islam after the 1970s Saudi oil boom and the 79 Iranian revolution.
[03:42:28.023 --> 03:42:34.626]  And she lists numerous examples where this purity culture has resulted the deaths of young women and girls.
[03:42:34.626 --> 03:42:36.527]  We'll get back on the other side to talk about it.
[03:42:36.527 --> 03:42:40.929]  This is the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:42:40.929 --> 03:42:41.509]  Don't go away.

[03:46:54.865 --> 03:46:57.507]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:07.725 --> 03:47:12.506]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[03:47:12.506 --> 03:47:16.307]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.307 --> 03:47:22.869]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:22.869 --> 03:47:29.811]  So, Mattel has released their first hijab Barbie.
[03:47:29.811 --> 03:47:36.433]  Having been directed to by actual feminists, who of course have sided with Islam, the most misogynistic belief system on the planet.
[03:47:37.202 --> 03:47:40.984]  And we were talking about how the hijab is not a symbol of feminism.
[03:47:40.984 --> 03:47:46.988]  Again, no matter how hard they try and sell that propaganda, the hijab is not a symbol of feminism.
[03:47:46.988 --> 03:47:52.552]  We were talking about Azraq Q. Nomani, the founder of the Muslim Reform Movement.
[03:47:52.552 --> 03:47:57.095]  Oh, by the way, the first Arab feminist Muslim groups in the Middle East discarded the hijab.
[03:47:57.095 --> 03:47:58.696]  They saw it as a symbol of oppression.
[03:47:59.446 --> 03:48:04.748]  A hundred years ago, but now CNN says it's cool, trendy and diverse and it's a feminist symbol.
[03:48:04.748 --> 03:48:07.088]  Okay, let's listen to what Azra Nomani says.
[03:48:07.088 --> 03:48:14.551]  She cites examples of this hijab purity culture and how it's led to the deaths of young women and girls.
[03:48:14.551 --> 03:48:24.954]  Recently in Bareilly, India, a father killed his daughter, four years old, smashing her head against the floor when her scarf slipped from her head during dinner.
[03:48:25.777 --> 03:48:35.681]  In Ontario, a few years ago, a man strangled his 16-year-old sister when she defied their father, including by refusing to cover her hair.
[03:48:35.681 --> 03:48:45.505]  Back in November last year, a former University of Missouri instructor dragged a female relative aged 14 out of school by the hair when he discovered she hadn't covered her hair.
[03:48:47.208 --> 03:49:01.299]  Today in Iran, friends of the journalist Mahesh Alin Ajad dodge batons as they shoot photos of themselves hair bare in a campaign Alin Ajad started, My Stealthy Freedom, to protest against Iran's mandatory headscarf law.
[03:49:01.299 --> 03:49:03.581]  You've seen the pictures, we've shared them in the past.
[03:49:03.581 --> 03:49:06.063]  Women in Iran, Muslim women, take off their veil
[03:49:06.784 --> 03:49:16.307]  As a form of protest, they're protesting for actual feminist freedom, because Iran enforces a draconian law making them wear a headscarf.
[03:49:16.307 --> 03:49:19.827]  So all across the Middle East, the hijab is a sign of oppression.
[03:49:19.827 --> 03:49:25.749]  It's a sign of the actual patriarchy, and now it's being promoted by feminists.
[03:49:25.749 --> 03:49:28.290]  You want to talk about toxic masculinity?
[03:49:28.290 --> 03:49:31.291]  That's the only place in which it exists, really, in the world.
[03:49:31.291 --> 03:49:32.931]  Few other places, but mainly there.
[03:49:33.658 --> 03:49:40.421]  And you're promoting the very symbol of toxic masculinity by claiming it's some kind of feminist symbol.
[03:49:40.421 --> 03:49:41.381]  It's not.
[03:49:41.381 --> 03:49:48.243]  The women in Syria liberated from ISIS discard their veil because ISIS makes them wear it.
[03:49:48.243 --> 03:49:49.604]  It's not a feminist symbol.
[03:49:49.604 --> 03:49:52.385]  It's not a symbol of freedom to cover up women.
[03:49:53.783 --> 03:49:57.866]  I see, like, four five-year-old kids running around in hijabs.
[03:49:57.866 --> 03:49:59.407]  It's just completely wrong.
[03:49:59.407 --> 03:50:02.148]  No matter how hard you try and push this, it's not gonna work.
[03:50:02.148 --> 03:50:04.710]  It's not gonna work.
[03:50:04.710 --> 03:50:06.311]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:50:06.311 --> 03:50:10.673]  Let's tell you again about InfoWarsStore.com before we get into a few final news.
[03:50:10.673 --> 03:50:13.936]  Because we've got all the great specials up there.
[03:50:13.936 --> 03:50:17.178]  Again, 50% off InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:50:17.178 --> 03:50:18.558]  A ton of great specials.
[03:50:18.558 --> 03:50:19.979]  We also have Brain Force.
[03:50:19.979 --> 03:50:21.900]  Now, this is what I really want to emphasize.
[03:50:21.900 --> 03:50:22.621]  Brain Force.
[03:50:23.436 --> 03:50:24.938]  You have to get your brain force.
[03:50:24.938 --> 03:50:30.843]  You have to stock up for Christmas on brain force because it triggers the left like nothing more.
[03:50:30.843 --> 03:50:33.446]  I'm going to talk about this every week forever now.
[03:50:33.446 --> 03:50:35.688]  Let's just absolutely cash in on this.
[03:50:35.688 --> 03:50:38.691]  You remember BuzzFeed, of course.
[03:50:38.691 --> 03:50:43.596]  They came out with a big hit piece about our products saying, oh, is there something wrong with InfoWars products?
[03:50:43.596 --> 03:50:45.238]  Turns out, no, they're perfectly fine.
[03:50:46.149 --> 03:50:47.450]  Gave us a nice little boost.
[03:50:47.450 --> 03:50:52.452]  We actually made money off that hit piece, and we used it to sell more products in the future.
[03:50:52.452 --> 03:50:55.453]  We actually created a BuzzFeed special at the time.
[03:50:55.453 --> 03:51:07.718]  We should probably create a BrainForce special at some time in the near future, given the amount of triggering that's gone on with the mainstream media as regards to BrainForce, BrainForce Plus, over the past couple of weeks.
[03:51:07.718 --> 03:51:15.562]  So you can get your BrainForce stock up for Christmas, get all the other great specials, 50% off a lot of them, with free shipping across the board.
[03:51:16.705 --> 03:51:29.975]  Now in this final few minutes let's get back into something that I was talking about in a video I released called the new sexual Puritans.
[03:51:29.975 --> 03:51:34.739]  Now of course we've had a massive fallout from this sex abuse scandal.
[03:51:34.739 --> 03:51:38.802]  Now if you go up on DrudgeReport.com they've got a story about Arianna Huffington
[03:51:39.716 --> 03:51:43.879]  Turned a blind eye to sexual abuse, sexual assault at the Huffington Post.
[03:51:43.879 --> 03:51:47.441]  This is really affecting predominantly the left.
[03:51:47.441 --> 03:51:51.844]  Of course, it first emerged out of Hollywood with the Harvey Weinstein revelations.
[03:51:51.844 --> 03:51:56.407]  Now it's infecting politics over in the UK.
[03:51:56.407 --> 03:52:04.393]  We had the Pestminster scandal, so-called, because there was a lot of revelations about sex abuse being uncovered in Westminster.
[03:52:05.695 --> 03:52:11.076]  Of course now it's affecting newsrooms across America, predominantly left-wing.
[03:52:11.076 --> 03:52:17.738]  Now of course you had sex abuse scandals on the right, you've got the Judge Roy Moore situation, now he denies the allegations.
[03:52:17.738 --> 03:52:28.820]  It's predominantly though affects the left, which of course is highly ironic because they're the ones who constantly virtue signal about how misogynistic, about how sexist the right is.
[03:52:28.820 --> 03:52:29.881]  And yet what do we see?
[03:52:29.881 --> 03:52:31.441]  A lot of the most prominent
[03:52:32.006 --> 03:52:37.752]  Vehement male feminists have since been exposed as sexual abusers of women.
[03:52:37.752 --> 03:52:42.597]  Because we had the hilarious case of Sam Chris, who was a very prominent hater of mine.
[03:52:42.597 --> 03:52:44.239]  He was a vice writer.
[03:52:44.239 --> 03:52:45.761]  I think he also wrote for the Guardian.
[03:52:46.832 --> 03:52:48.454]  He was a male feminist.
[03:52:48.454 --> 03:52:50.135]  He was one of my most vehement haters.
[03:52:50.135 --> 03:52:57.162]  He was a far-left Marxist, constantly virtue-signalling about how we were all misogynistic bigots.
[03:52:57.162 --> 03:52:59.365]  Of course, you know what happened to Sam Criss, right?
[03:52:59.365 --> 03:53:05.351]  Well, the woman who he sexually assaulted went public and basically laid bare how he was
[03:53:06.505 --> 03:53:08.346]  Trying to get her to have sex with him.
[03:53:08.346 --> 03:53:09.447]  She wasn't interested.
[03:53:09.447 --> 03:53:10.747]  He put his hands on her.
[03:53:10.747 --> 03:53:12.548]  He sexually assaulted her.
[03:53:12.548 --> 03:53:15.770]  He also bragged about, by the way, this is a Marxist, remember?
[03:53:15.770 --> 03:53:17.511]  This is a Marxist.
[03:53:17.511 --> 03:53:25.195]  He bragged about how he could take her back to, quote, his parents' massive house or his massive house.
[03:53:25.195 --> 03:53:27.556]  He said, I can take you back to my massive house.
[03:53:27.556 --> 03:53:29.337]  The girl said, well, it's not your house, is it?
[03:53:29.337 --> 03:53:30.758]  It's your parents' house.
[03:53:30.758 --> 03:53:33.079]  And he said, well, yeah, but I'm going to inherit it.
[03:53:35.242 --> 03:53:37.224]  This is a Marxist!
[03:53:37.224 --> 03:53:40.266]  He's talking about the economic system in that way.
[03:53:40.266 --> 03:53:42.728]  And he's sexually assaulting women.
[03:53:42.728 --> 03:53:43.989]  And he admitted to it.
[03:53:43.989 --> 03:53:47.151]  He's since disappeared from Twitter.
[03:53:47.151 --> 03:53:55.238]  And the irony is delectable because he was the one, he was one of the prominent people who was lecturing everybody else about how they need to be an ally of women.
[03:53:55.238 --> 03:53:59.581]  A male feminist, he turns out to be an actual sexual abuser.
[03:53:59.581 --> 03:54:01.643]  Because he also had Rupert Myers.
[03:54:02.873 --> 03:54:06.395]  He also had to apologize for grabbing, for groping women.
[03:54:06.395 --> 03:54:09.697]  He was a vehement male feminist.
[03:54:09.697 --> 03:54:24.947]  So again, the fallout seems to affect predominantly a lot on the left, but as I explained in this video, the new sexual Puritans, which is up on my YouTube channel, it's now kind of crossed over, it's transgressed into something more, which is
[03:54:26.030 --> 03:54:38.176]  Third wave feminism, having been completely debunked and discredited, now hijacking this scandal as it crosses across the board from the entertainment industry to politics to newsrooms.
[03:54:38.176 --> 03:54:43.998]  They're hijacking the scandal to demonize and to demean all men.
[03:54:43.998 --> 03:54:50.221]  Now, I give evidence of this in the article, in the video, sorry, because we had Lindy West being given a platform last week
[03:54:51.155 --> 03:55:09.349]  Another top feminist, Lindy West, given a platform by the New York Times to basically make the argument that this proves that feminists, third-wave screeching, harpy feminists, were right all along, that all men are evil, that it was right to hate men, that Miss Andree is perfectly okay, because look.
[03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:10.289]  Look what happened.
[03:55:10.289 --> 03:55:12.571]  Look at all these men abusing women.
[03:55:13.266 --> 03:55:33.449]  So again, they institute this collectivist narrative where all men, an entire gender, are to blame for the actions of a relative few, if you compare the few who've been exposed to the actual male population in the West, conflate that and use it to demonize all men to say, look, we were right all along.
[03:55:33.449 --> 03:55:35.990]  And what did Lindy West do?
[03:55:35.990 --> 03:55:40.431]  What did these other top feminists do in the aftermath of the Harvey Weinstein scandal?
[03:55:40.431 --> 03:55:42.951]  Well, they wrote articles, they wrote blogs, they made videos,
[03:55:44.219 --> 03:55:48.262]  Saying, basically, men need to ascribe to all these different behaviours.
[03:55:48.262 --> 03:56:02.110]  In fact, there was one Medium article which listed 20 behaviours that men needed to take, that needed to change and adopt, in order to not be an evil, sexist, misogynistic abuser of women.
[03:56:02.110 --> 03:56:04.792]  So they basically came out and said, look, you're all guilty.
[03:56:04.792 --> 03:56:08.614]  You had what was his name, Matt McGorry, the actor on CNN, come out and say,
[03:56:09.577 --> 03:56:10.677]  We're all complicit.
[03:56:10.677 --> 03:56:11.978]  All men are complicit in this.
[03:56:11.978 --> 03:56:12.738]  We're all guilty.
[03:56:12.738 --> 03:56:22.141]  Oh, and by the way, the only way for you to atone for it is to adopt all our demented far-left political beliefs.
[03:56:22.141 --> 03:56:25.062]  Well, isn't that a coincidence?
[03:56:25.062 --> 03:56:31.824]  The only way we can prove we're not evil sexual abusers is by adopting all your political beliefs.
[03:56:31.824 --> 03:56:34.845]  Oh, but this is about protecting women, isn't it?
[03:56:34.845 --> 03:56:35.565]  No, it's not!
[03:56:36.187 --> 03:56:37.427]  It's about power.
[03:56:37.427 --> 03:56:39.448]  It always comes back to power.
[03:56:39.448 --> 03:56:50.490]  So in one case, in this Medium article, this top feminist, and it's in the video, you can read the examples, she basically goes through it and said, right, now you need to support abortion.
[03:56:50.490 --> 03:56:52.530]  You need to support Black Lives Matter.
[03:56:52.530 --> 03:56:57.991]  There was all kind of weird stuff in there, like you need to only watch ethical porn, whatever that is.
[03:56:57.991 --> 03:56:58.871]  A bunch of other stuff.
[03:56:58.871 --> 03:57:02.012]  She said you can't use the term social justice warrior anymore.
[03:57:02.012 --> 03:57:02.812]  That's sexist.
[03:57:03.419 --> 03:57:05.420]  You can't use the term feminazi anymore.
[03:57:05.420 --> 03:57:12.764]  It's basically an entire list of language policing, of thought policing, of behavior control.
[03:57:12.764 --> 03:57:19.008]  And if you don't adopt all of this, you're an evil, sexist, misogynistic abuser of women.
[03:57:19.008 --> 03:57:22.570]  That's what they're doing with the fallout from this sexual abuse scandal.
[03:57:22.570 --> 03:57:27.193]  They're conflating it, hijacking it, using it for their own ends.
[03:57:27.193 --> 03:57:29.694]  That's going to wrap it up for this hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:29.694 --> 03:57:30.775]  War Room is coming up.
[03:57:31.296 --> 03:57:32.878]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
