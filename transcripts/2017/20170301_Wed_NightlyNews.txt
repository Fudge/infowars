[00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.593]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.713 --> 00:00:22.895]  I'm David Knight and it's Wednesday, March the 1st, 2017.
[00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:23.795]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.585]  Tonight, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began.
[00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:44.511]  President Donald Trump knocked it out of the park last night in his historic speech to Congress.
[00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:56.540]  And although most of the liberal snowflakes sat on their hands most of the evening, other progressives like Trump critic Van Jones admitted that that was one of the most extraordinary moments.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.182]  You have ever seen in American politics, period.
[00:01:01.023 --> 00:01:11.130]  Then, it's the wonderful world of childhood gayness, as Disney features their very first same-sex kiss.
[00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:16.373]  Pass the popcorn, kids!
[00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:21.557]  All that plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:08.123]  Last night was President Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress.
[00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:17.247]  And I want to read to you what Van Jones, who is of course a Trump critic, a liberal, and this is in the Washington Post, I want to read to you what he had to say about it.
[00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:27.511]  He said that Trump's tribute to Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who died in a raid in Yemen, was, quote, one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics, period.
[00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:28.695]  We're good to go.
[00:03:44.591 --> 00:04:04.241]  And then they go on, they have his full commentary, and he said, for people who have been hoping that maybe he would remain a divisive cartoon, which he often finds a way to do, they should begin to become a little bit worried tonight, because that thing you just saw him do, if he finds a way to do that over and over again, he's going to be there for eight years.
[00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:05.862]  Now, let me tell you something.
[00:04:05.942 --> 00:04:10.825]  When he said a divisive cartoon, the people who were divisive cartoons last night,
[00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.545]  Well, the Democrats who sat there, most of them in white, these women in white, they were the device of cartoon.
[00:04:18.413 --> 00:04:25.280]  They showed that they would refuse to join with Donald Trump in pursuing the common good for the American people.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.307]  They're all about their self-interest, all about their self-aggrandizement, all about their petty politics, their petty political careers.
[00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:40.554]  And they showed this by refusing to applaud for this Navy SEAL's widow, sitting there on their hands.
[00:04:40.594 --> 00:04:41.215]  We showed that to you.
[00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:42.356]  But then it got even worse.
[00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:51.436]  At one point, they booed Donald Trump when he talked about helping people who have been the victims of crimes committed by immigrants.
[00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:53.777]  Violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants.
[00:04:54.137 --> 00:04:56.198]  Foreign citizens here, illegally.
[00:04:56.878 --> 00:04:58.699]  And he wants to set up a program to help them.
[00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:00.600]  He said, we must support the victims of crime.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.701]  I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.
[00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:06.642]  He said the office is called VOICE.
[00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:09.563]  Victims of immigration crime engagement.
[00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:15.485]  We're providing a voice to those people who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.
[00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:18.006]  And the Democrats booed him.
[00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:19.266]  I tweeted that out live.
[00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.627]  I was live tweeting the speech last night.
[00:05:22.207 --> 00:05:25.048]  I said, wow, that truly is amazing.
[00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:27.289]  It really shows where they're coming from.
[00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:30.771]  Are the divisive cartoons.
[00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:32.172]  They continue to go further down.
[00:05:32.592 --> 00:05:45.982]  And I thought it was interesting because he introduced the father of one of the people who was killed, a black man, Jamil Shah, father of Jamil Shah II, who was a 17-year-old high school student when he was killed by Pedro Espinosa, an illegal immigrant.
[00:05:46.482 --> 00:05:53.628]  And he was interviewed on Fox News Channel, Fox and Friends, and he said, I was like, man, you know, what do they want?
[00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:56.676]  They don't want nothing but division and bickering.
[00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:58.477]  They don't want to solve any problems.
[00:05:58.517 --> 00:06:02.758]  They don't want to help kids or husbands or family members that have been murdered by illegals.
[00:06:02.818 --> 00:06:07.500]  I mean, just the way they did that was so disrespectful.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.541]  But it's bigger than them, so I just keep on moving.
[00:06:10.781 --> 00:06:14.402]  I just ignore them like they ignore me.
[00:06:15.062 --> 00:06:18.444]  See, we're all understanding now, black and white.
[00:06:18.484 --> 00:06:21.985]  We understand that these Democrats are about nothing but themselves.
[00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:29.594]  And they will put together a demographic that they think can keep these demagogues elected.
[00:06:29.674 --> 00:06:32.575]  And I think they were the big losers last night.
[00:06:33.156 --> 00:06:34.456]  And I want to just throw this in.
[00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:39.478]  Just within the last week, we've seen a guy who was an ISIS car bomber.
[00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:42.980]  Now we talk about vetting these immigrants who come in.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.580]  They say, oh, this is awful.
[00:06:45.061 --> 00:06:47.702]  You're keeping people out of here simply because they're Muslims.
[00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:49.743]  It's like, these are seven countries that
[00:06:50.851 --> 00:06:52.433]  Barack Obama went to war with.
[00:06:52.953 --> 00:06:53.614]  He sent bombs.
[00:06:53.654 --> 00:06:54.475]  He sent troops there.
[00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:58.058]  So maybe you should have said something about that if you don't think the people are dangerous.
[00:06:58.098 --> 00:07:00.761]  But nevertheless, take a look at this particular situation.
[00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:03.824]  We've got a guy who was apprehended in 2001-2002.
[00:07:03.844 --> 00:07:05.565]  He was held in Gitmo for two years, from 2002 to 2004.
[00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:13.510]  And when he was released, his name was Ronald Fidler.
[00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.291]  He was a UK citizen who was in Pakistan there to fight.
[00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:19.751]  They thought he was part of the Taliban.
[00:07:20.512 --> 00:07:28.874]  And after they released him, he said he was tortured in Gitmo, and so the British government gave him one million pounds, about a million and a half dollars, as compensation.
[00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.410]  He wasn't amused.
[00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:38.372]  He went back to fight, to continue to do this fighting, and he blew himself up in a car bomb in Iraq.
[00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:43.513]  So all these people who say they're going to do extreme vetting, they're against any vetting.
[00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:45.014]  We just don't even have to do vetting.
[00:07:45.734 --> 00:07:49.435]  Think about the fact they had this guy at Gitmo for two years and they still didn't know what he was about.
[00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:54.776]  They still let him out, they still gave him compensation, a million and a half dollars, and then he continued to do that.
[00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:57.190]  Now I want to change gears and I want to go back.
[00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:02.553]  We've talked a lot about the Oscars and of course that was the last big public event that we had before this joint session of Congress.
[00:08:03.294 --> 00:08:05.155]  I want to go back and take a look at something.
[00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:07.496]  There's a channel called Honest Trailers.
[00:08:07.516 --> 00:08:09.177]  They do a great job of parodying the movies.
[00:08:09.537 --> 00:08:16.662]  They did a program a week before the Oscars and they went through all the different nominees and they did a short bit on all of them and I want to show you what they did.
[00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:20.844]  Follow along on the poetic unfolding of a life beautifully directed by Barry Jenkins as this young
[00:08:45.655 --> 00:08:46.156]  Black.
[00:08:46.556 --> 00:08:47.337]  Gay man.
[00:08:47.877 --> 00:08:49.719]  Struggles to escape from poverty.
[00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:51.340]  And drug addiction.
[00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:53.502]  Told across three decades.
[00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:55.184]  Based on a play.
[00:08:55.704 --> 00:08:57.586]  Based on the life story of its author.
[00:08:58.106 --> 00:08:59.848]  So yeah, I'd say it's nominated for an Oscar.
[00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:02.490]  It's got all of the checkpoints.
[00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.132]  And yes, it was the one that won.
[00:09:04.172 --> 00:09:09.777]  They knew that was going to be the one that won because it went through every checkpoint of their agenda.
[00:09:10.157 --> 00:09:11.979]  They have an agenda that they want to push on us.
[00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:22.281]  I want to take a look at how that's starting to look, the agenda that they're pushing on our kids, to sexualize our kids at an earlier and earlier age, to confuse them about their gender.
[00:09:22.301 --> 00:09:30.844]  We've had the American Pediatric Society talking about how there are only two genders, and this is really child abuse when you're doing this to kids, to try to confuse them.
[00:09:30.884 --> 00:09:32.584]  Let's take a look at this article on Infowars today.
[00:09:33.266 --> 00:09:37.736]  Disney Channel Cartoon features the network's first same-sex kiss.
[00:09:38.337 --> 00:09:43.248]  A crowd of cartoon characters appear to deliver same-sex kisses to gay and lesbian partners.
[00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:50.472]  This is from Season 2 episode of Star vs. the Forces of Evil, entitled Just Friends.
[00:09:50.512 --> 00:10:00.276]  And when you look at this picture, and you look at these stills that are there in the article, I mean, here's a couple that are isolated, and everybody around them is doing it, okay?
[00:10:00.336 --> 00:10:04.958]  This is Brave New World that is being sold to our kids by Disney.
[00:10:05.598 --> 00:10:11.120]  And of course they've sold magic and all this kind of stuff for a long time, but now they're focusing on the sexual agenda.
[00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:21.185]  They say throughout this first on-scene screen same-sex personal display of affection, Disney has periodically included non-heterosexual relationships in its TV shows.
[00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:32.233]  Like the lesbian couple in Good Luck Charlie and a gay couple in Gravity Falls, viewers have also speculated about the possibly gay characters included in the films Zootopia, Finding Dory, and Frozen.
[00:10:32.694 --> 00:10:44.863]  Disney has also reportedly been entertaining the prospect of an LGBT Disney princess with a campaign last year urging the cartoon giant to turn the princess Elsa from the film Frozen into a lesbian princess.
[00:10:44.883 --> 00:10:46.324]  Well, you don't have to wait any longer.
[00:10:47.102 --> 00:10:54.230]  The Telegraph in the UK pointed out today that Disney's going to have its first exclusively gay moment in Beauty and the Beast.
[00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.912]  This is going to be the live action version of it.
[00:10:55.952 --> 00:11:02.779]  They say Disney's moving firmly into a new era as it introduces its first exclusively gay moment.
[00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:04.862]  And I want to read you what the director says about this.
[00:11:05.382 --> 00:11:22.317]  This was an interview that the director gave with a magazine called Attitude, and the director, Bill Condon, said, this character, LeFou, maybe I'm pronouncing it wrong, I don't pay any attention to Disney's Beauty and the Beast, but anyway, it says, is somebody who, on one day, wants to be Gaston, and another day, he wants to kiss Gaston.
[00:11:23.098 --> 00:11:27.719]  And Josh makes something really subtle and really delicious out of it.
[00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:36.122]  And that's what has its payoff at the end, which I don't want to give away, but it's a nice, exclusively gay moment in a Disney movie.
[00:11:36.782 --> 00:11:38.123]  See, they're pushing this on your kids.
[00:11:38.423 --> 00:11:46.925]  When I look at that picture, whether it was homosexual or heterosexual kids over in the background, what they're doing is they're putting peer pressure on.
[00:11:47.505 --> 00:11:52.587]  They're normalizing behavior for very young children that is not age appropriate.
[00:11:53.342 --> 00:11:54.544]  And we know where this is all headed.
[00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:57.889]  The next place it's headed is, of course, the transgender bathrooms.
[00:11:57.909 --> 00:11:59.090]  That's what this is all about.
[00:12:00.123 --> 00:12:01.583]  And moving towards pedophilia.
[00:12:01.603 --> 00:12:03.044]  We're going to talk about that in just a moment.
[00:12:03.684 --> 00:12:09.326]  But take a look at the penalty that Target has paid for pushing this agenda in their stores.
[00:12:09.706 --> 00:12:15.748]  Their stocks are down $15 billion since promoting their transgender agenda.
[00:12:16.228 --> 00:12:18.108]  And they were pushing it very hard in their stores.
[00:12:18.128 --> 00:12:22.850]  They were at the forefront of trying to push this with their product lines, then pushing it with their bathrooms.
[00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.871]  Now their value is down 30% while Walmart has gained
[00:12:27.112 --> 00:12:28.173]  3% in the same period.
[00:12:28.213 --> 00:12:30.916]  This is a story on Infowars.com from Breitbart.
[00:12:31.997 --> 00:12:33.058]  But where is this all headed?
[00:12:33.078 --> 00:12:36.642]  Of course it's all headed towards normalizing pedophilia.
[00:12:37.482 --> 00:12:41.827]  And we have an article from the Free Thought talking about what's happening in the UK.
[00:12:42.207 --> 00:12:42.728]  Two things.
[00:12:43.368 --> 00:12:49.134]  Number one, how they are pulling back from naming streets after politicians.
[00:12:49.884 --> 00:12:58.867]  Or heroes, because they're afraid, it's happened so much, they're afraid that after they name these streets, then they're going to find out that the person has been exposed as a child molester.
[00:12:58.907 --> 00:13:05.729]  They say, and this is a guideline that has been sent out to city councils in the UK, they said, don't do this.
[00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:16.112]  They say, it avoids a possible occurrence of future information coming to light that may then taint that specific road name based on an individual and give rise to costly street renaming procedures.
[00:13:16.172 --> 00:13:18.153]  They say this may seem odd, but remember,
[00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:21.493]  The pedophilia has long been a history of the British elite.
[00:13:21.673 --> 00:13:39.602]  Matter of fact, you go back several decades to Edward Heath, former Prime Minister of the UK, he's been accused by the police chief as being a pedophile, and they had made his home in Salisbury a memorial museum back in 2015 to mark the 50th anniversary of him becoming the Conservative Party leader.
[00:13:40.342 --> 00:13:49.366]  Then the exhibition, they say, is now a glaring embarrassment as dozens of his former victims have come forward exposing his disgusting sexual crimes.
[00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:53.928]  British citizens refuse to patronize this shrine to a monster, so it sits empty.
[00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:56.989]  Now understand, this is a Conservative Party leader.
[00:13:57.649 --> 00:13:59.710]  And these are people that the establishment has covered up.
[00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:01.451]  We saw that happen with Jimmy Savile.
[00:14:02.131 --> 00:14:05.793]  He was investigated by Scotland Yard several times and it was shut down by the people who were higher up.
[00:14:06.536 --> 00:14:12.546]  They did a documentary on him after he died at the BBC exposing what he was and the people who were higher up at the BBC.
[00:14:12.926 --> 00:14:13.467]  Shut that down.
[00:14:14.448 --> 00:14:17.290]  Do we give a pass to people because they agree with us politically?
[00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.873]  Because they're conservative and we're conservative because they support Trump and we support Trump?
[00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:24.556]  See, this is the issue that I had with what was going on with Milo.
[00:14:25.236 --> 00:14:29.139]  We don't want to move that line closer to pedophilia.
[00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:30.320]  That's where these people are going.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.821]  We don't want to blur that line.
[00:14:31.861 --> 00:14:36.585]  We don't want to erase that line because we agree with somebody politically.
[00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:39.372]  And that's precisely what was happening with us.
[00:14:39.432 --> 00:14:45.976]  We do not want to give people a pass because of their politics when they engage in this kind of issues.
[00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:49.018]  And what we're talking about here folks is consenting adults.
[00:14:49.058 --> 00:14:50.499]  I had a lot of people get very angry with me.
[00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:51.600]  You say you're a libertarian.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.241]  We're going to unfollow you on Twitter.
[00:14:53.381 --> 00:14:54.782]  I frankly don't care.
[00:14:54.802 --> 00:15:00.025]  I'm going to stand before God one day and I'm not going to be asked how many Twitter followers I have.
[00:15:00.726 --> 00:15:01.426]  And you will too.
[00:15:02.347 --> 00:15:03.928]  And you're not going to be asked that question either.
[00:15:04.861 --> 00:15:12.730]  And we do not throw our children under the bus for any political agenda, any sexualized agenda that is coming from the media, especially.
[00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.732]  Look at what else is happening in the UK.
[00:15:14.832 --> 00:15:25.124]  As this is becoming an epidemic, there they say, also from Free Thought Project, the UK police announced that there are so many pedophiles in the country that it's exploding at such a rapid rate that they will stop arresting them.
[00:15:25.985 --> 00:15:36.310]  Because police cannot cope with the huge influx of reports on child abuse, they now say pedophiles whose only crime is viewing child pornography should undergo rehabilitation instead of going to prison.
[00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.891]  Remember when all this stuff happened with Milo.
[00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:41.152]  He was only talking about it.
[00:15:41.532 --> 00:15:42.372]  He never committed it.
[00:15:42.472 --> 00:15:43.213]  And he was a victim.
[00:15:43.533 --> 00:15:44.813]  He's a victim of people like this.
[00:15:45.173 --> 00:15:46.414]  Do we want to perpetuate that?
[00:15:46.934 --> 00:15:47.675]  By talking about it?
[00:15:47.975 --> 00:15:48.815]  By normalizing it?
[00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:50.216]  Because of politics?
[00:15:50.556 --> 00:15:50.656]  No.
[00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:51.974]  No we don't.
[00:15:52.475 --> 00:15:57.347]  So now what they're saying is that in three years the number of child abuse reports have skyrocketed by 80%.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:26.947]  And the Chief Constable who's head of the Operation Hydrant, this is something that was set up to investigate multiple allegations of historic sexual abuse across the UK, the BBC reports, he knew his view would cause nervousness and draw headlines because he said the number of reports of abuse are such huge proportions that they cannot look at these particular crimes, the things that are going to be moving people towards actually acting on what they have created as urges.
[00:16:28.106 --> 00:16:37.512]  So they're not going to pay any attention to people because they say there are literally tens of thousands of men who are seeking to exploit children online with a view to meeting them.
[00:16:37.552 --> 00:16:44.876]  So they're going to focus on that rather than the half a million individuals who are engaged in child pornography.
[00:16:45.577 --> 00:16:48.718]  That is the sickness that faces the West.
[00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:49.539]  And where does it come from?
[00:16:49.999 --> 00:16:53.902]  It all starts with Diz Gay pushing all this agenda.
[00:16:54.102 --> 00:16:55.763]  And this is Hollywood throughout.
[00:16:56.598 --> 00:17:02.900]  They have a political agenda, they have a sexual agenda, they're all tied together, and we have to understand that they're pushing that agenda.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.901]  Then we have the other issue.
[00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:09.622]  Remember that Zbigniew Brzezinski talked about a technocratic elite?
[00:17:10.002 --> 00:17:13.443]  Well, the technology is the key part of this that we need to be concerned about.
[00:17:13.463 --> 00:17:21.305]  We've seen yet another nightmare robot from Boston Dynamics, and they called it a nightmare-inducing robot.
[00:17:21.325 --> 00:17:23.626]  The people who created it called it a nightmare.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.862]  This thing is a mixture of wheels and arms.
[00:17:27.902 --> 00:17:33.906]  They said it only has ten actuated joints, and so it is significantly less complex than the walking robots.
[00:17:33.926 --> 00:17:39.249]  The wheels, they say, are efficient on flat surfaces, while the legs can go almost anywhere by combining wheels and legs.
[00:17:39.749 --> 00:17:43.291]  This robot, that they called Handle, is the best of both worlds.
[00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:47.354]  And so the founder of this organization, which was bought by Google,
[00:17:48.499 --> 00:17:51.281]  Says that, uh, this is a nightmare-inducing robot.
[00:17:51.441 --> 00:17:56.585]  Even Google communications staff sought to distance the company from the hardware, they report.
[00:17:57.105 --> 00:17:59.026]  According, this was an email that was leaked to Bloomberg.
[00:17:59.066 --> 00:18:02.028]  They said, uh, such technology could be terrifying.
[00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:03.650]  Yes, you should be very afraid of this.
[00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.571]  You should organize to oppose this.
[00:18:05.991 --> 00:18:14.017]  And yet what we see is the people who are involved in technology, like the people at Wired Magazine, talk about how this is really an evolutionary marvel.
[00:18:14.557 --> 00:18:17.922]  They look at the very sophisticated technology and they rejoice in that.
[00:18:17.962 --> 00:18:27.414]  They say, the world laughed when we looked at the DARPA Robotics Challenge of just 2015, but look at how quickly we see this new life form evolving.
[00:18:28.135 --> 00:18:31.680]  This is another form of sickness that we have to get over.
[00:18:32.321 --> 00:18:35.662]  We have to understand that this is merely a tool, but there is such a thing as good and evil.
[00:18:35.802 --> 00:18:38.023]  This will be your over-order.
[00:18:38.103 --> 00:18:40.204]  This will be the weapon of evil men.
[00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.084]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:18:41.104 --> 00:18:42.165]  We're going to talk to Ted Malik.
[00:18:42.185 --> 00:18:46.266]  We're going to have clips of Alex Jones's interview with him earlier today on the radio show.
[00:18:46.687 --> 00:18:50.128]  He is the man that we need to go to the European Union.
[00:18:50.188 --> 00:18:51.849]  He is America's Nigel Farage.
[00:18:51.869 --> 00:18:52.209]  Stay with us.
[00:18:52.229 --> 00:18:52.749]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.169 --> 00:19:03.391]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.711 --> 00:19:15.722]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:19:15.742 --> 00:19:23.309]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.533]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.834 --> 00:23:00.762]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:05.562 --> 00:23:07.624]  Ted Malik of tedmalik.com joins us.
[00:23:08.104 --> 00:23:16.390]  I can't go over his whole pedigree of major institutions he's run or where he's a professor or all the things that he's been involved in.
[00:23:17.151 --> 00:23:24.416]  He's also been a high-ranking official on the UN Economic Commission for Europe and president of the CNN World Economic
[00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:25.036]  We're good.
[00:23:43.792 --> 00:23:45.793]  Nomination of Ted Malik as U.S.
[00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:46.993]  Ambassador.
[00:23:47.033 --> 00:23:57.316]  So, they're saying don't nominate him, Trump, even though that's who they've said they want to nominate, because if you do that, we're going to veto it, which again is unprecedented.
[00:23:57.356 --> 00:24:01.337]  And of course, I've seen Ted Malik all over TV for years.
[00:24:02.158 --> 00:24:03.758]  I mean, he comes off as very diplomatic.
[00:24:04.238 --> 00:24:06.699]  I mean, sounds like a perfect choice.
[00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:10.380]  If you went over his whole bio here, he's already been accepted into all these groups.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.221]  They know who he is.
[00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:22.955]  It says Suave and Distinguished, he's a professor at the respected British Business School, former Oxford Visiting Fellow, Yale professor, he's written 14 books, he's a high-ranking official at the U.N.
[00:24:23.095 --> 00:24:24.936]  Economic Commission, and it just goes on and on.
[00:24:24.956 --> 00:24:25.776]  I can't read the whole bio.
[00:24:26.456 --> 00:24:28.057]  So, why does Trump want it?
[00:24:28.637 --> 00:24:29.797]  Why are they trying to block it?
[00:24:29.817 --> 00:24:31.678]  I think talking to the man himself we can find out.
[00:24:31.718 --> 00:24:36.540]  His longtime friend, Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's also joining us via Skype, can pop in.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.860]  So, Ted, thanks for coming on.
[00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:40.021]  What's going on here?
[00:24:40.931 --> 00:24:42.492]  Alex, thanks for having me.
[00:24:42.532 --> 00:24:43.852]  It's a pleasure to be on your show.
[00:24:43.892 --> 00:24:51.335]  I last saw you at the inauguration when we were celebrating President Trump's arrival on the Washington scene.
[00:24:51.595 --> 00:24:59.999]  And last night, of course, as you've just shown in your clip, he said he's going to be president of the United States and not president of the world.
[00:25:00.379 --> 00:25:10.588]  The reason that I've, I think, raised such a controversy in Europe is certainly not because of my educational pedigree or my dialogical skills.
[00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:16.454]  It's because I represent the worldview and the thinking of Donald Trump.
[00:25:17.214 --> 00:25:34.227]  In Europe, and they actually hate and detest everything he is, stands for, and has said, because he's turning the whole world over, and he's changing their globalist outlook, and forcing the world back into a state-centric system.
[00:25:35.468 --> 00:25:43.414]  Like the pencil that's falling off the table has reached its tipping point, and a number of countries around the world are likely to follow suit.
[00:25:44.278 --> 00:26:01.172]  You know, maybe we can pull that clip up briefly of when Brexit passed and the next day Nigel Farage, leading the torch in Europe obviously, I know you know him as well, says, you know, you laughed at me 15 years ago when I was first in this body, you're not laughing now, but they still laugh, and then Pelosi
[00:26:01.872 --> 00:26:04.253]  Won't even stand up, you know, for the veterans.
[00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:05.854]  The Democrats sat down.
[00:26:06.954 --> 00:26:11.516]  They boo and get upset when Trump talks about America first.
[00:26:11.596 --> 00:26:14.197]  I mean, the disconnect of these people.
[00:26:14.577 --> 00:26:18.699]  In the same press conference, Pelosi thinks Bush is still president eight plus years later.
[00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:24.742]  And then Maxine Waters gets up and says, well, Trump's helping Putin, who invaded Korea.
[00:26:25.222 --> 00:26:27.543]  They don't even say North or South Korea in their mistake.
[00:26:27.603 --> 00:26:29.023]  It's just la la land.
[00:26:29.063 --> 00:26:30.044]  I've been around these people.
[00:26:30.104 --> 00:26:30.984]  I've talked to some of them.
[00:26:31.504 --> 00:26:38.586]  They really are so insulated that I guess I was wrong back when I thought it was more centralized and conspiratorial.
[00:26:38.646 --> 00:26:42.888]  It's more like just a bunch of corrupt people got in control.
[00:26:43.228 --> 00:26:53.511]  Special interests just come in and it's almost worse than a conspiracy because it's like we just have no defense mechanism against these inept horrible people that have sold us out for pennies on the dollar.
[00:26:54.707 --> 00:27:15.778]  Well, you're talking about the Democratic Party in the United States, and it was quite observable last night when half the room was giving the President a deserved standing ovation for some, I think, very, very sincere words, both about the American military and about our military heroes, and also about some of the policies he wants to enact.
[00:27:15.818 --> 00:27:19.020]  And the other half of the room either sat on their hands or hissed at him.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.161]  So, it's a very polarized situation.
[00:27:22.241 --> 00:27:36.846]  That situation is actually ten times worse in Europe, where the political spectrum is certainly left of the United States and where Donald Trump is held in the highest degree of contempt.
[00:27:36.866 --> 00:27:42.729]  I think it would interest you, Alex, I was on CNN before the election and Becky Anderson's show.
[00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:46.210]  I do go on all these shows, I keep getting invited and go back.
[00:27:46.869 --> 00:27:50.731]  Maybe to torture them as much as myself, but she asked me seriously.
[00:27:50.991 --> 00:27:59.776]  The question that she asked me was, don't you think the whole world should get to vote for the United States president?
[00:28:00.116 --> 00:28:00.396]  Wow.
[00:28:02.497 --> 00:28:03.038]  I missed that.
[00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:03.978]  Well, let's find that clip.
[00:28:03.998 --> 00:28:04.778]  What was the name of the clip?
[00:28:04.798 --> 00:28:05.579]  You remember on YouTube?
[00:28:06.434 --> 00:28:09.855]  Well, it's Becky Anderson's show, State of the World, or whatever it's called.
[00:28:09.955 --> 00:28:10.735]  Yeah, guys, Google it.
[00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:11.576]  State of the World.
[00:28:11.916 --> 00:28:13.977]  Everyone in the world should be able to vote for president.
[00:28:14.017 --> 00:28:14.637]  I'm going to find that.
[00:28:14.857 --> 00:28:15.397]  That is incredible.
[00:28:15.517 --> 00:28:15.997]  Glenn Beck.
[00:28:16.017 --> 00:28:26.441]  I don't want to sit here and bash Glenn Beck, sir, but Glenn Beck was on CNN last week and he said, quote, it's scary that Trump and Bannon want nationalism and economic nationalism.
[00:28:26.461 --> 00:28:29.082]  I mean, that is, so again, there it is.
[00:28:29.142 --> 00:28:29.902]  I mean, what are they doing?
[00:28:32.093 --> 00:28:42.744]  Well, I mean, Glenn Beck, I think, has been off his rocker for some time, but Steve Bannon is the genius behind this intellectually.
[00:28:43.464 --> 00:28:44.545]  He is the strategist.
[00:28:44.786 --> 00:28:51.572]  He talked about his three buckets that he's trying to work out of during CPAC the other day, and I think that was very telltale.
[00:28:52.513 --> 00:28:54.253]  We're talking about renewal.
[00:29:15.791 --> 00:29:18.552]  We are talking about renewal of the American spirit.
[00:29:18.592 --> 00:29:27.033]  And actually, you know, I am a spiritual person, a Christian, and I noticed that Trump mentioned God at least a half a dozen times, it seems like.
[00:29:27.053 --> 00:29:27.814]  I hate that.
[00:29:28.254 --> 00:29:32.515]  So the origin, even, of some of this impetus is clear in his thinking.
[00:29:32.535 --> 00:29:41.817]  And I tell you, people on the right, people in evangelical circles, strong Catholics, appreciate what the President is saying.
[00:29:42.157 --> 00:29:43.017]  Well, we definitely...
[00:29:44.156 --> 00:29:44.376]  I don't
[00:30:05.936 --> 00:30:08.798]  Ted, the website's tedmalik.com.
[00:30:09.159 --> 00:30:28.254]  What else can we do, as I bring Dr. Corsi in here briefly, what else can we do to help ensure, and you've also written a lot of books as well, to make sure that this new nationalism, what I call 1776 worldwide, the American example worldwide, not physical force, but the American spirit of renaissance reborn for renewal of the whole planet.
[00:30:28.294 --> 00:30:33.619]  This is what we need, not a, you know, UN global corporate elite dictatorship coming in.
[00:30:33.939 --> 00:30:37.241]  You know, dictating the terms of human surrender to the technocracy.
[00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:46.488]  What can we do to have Trump fully nominate you and then try to somehow finesse you into the position and have the EU accept it?
[00:30:47.048 --> 00:30:48.129]  Well, there are two things.
[00:30:48.489 --> 00:31:00.318]  Obviously, in the first hand, we have to remind Donald Trump that I've had this conversation and that I'm the best candidate, I think, to represent that point of view in Europe because of qualifications.
[00:31:00.999 --> 00:31:08.883]  And frankly, because I've spent all this time in Europe and understand and can constructively talk with them.
[00:31:09.123 --> 00:31:11.584]  I'm not there to be their archenemy.
[00:31:11.644 --> 00:31:13.945]  I just have to bring them our point of view.
[00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:24.470]  And secondly, I think if the European Union wants to make me persona non grata, which is what they say, it would be a badge of honor to make me PNG in Brussels.
[00:31:25.071 --> 00:31:30.634]  And actually say we won't accept an ambassador from the United States who has Trump's point of view.
[00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:33.056]  I think we should then do two things.
[00:31:34.037 --> 00:31:39.000]  Send them no ambassador and deal with them only on a bilateral basis.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:39.340]  Yes.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.723]  And secondly, remove their ambassador from Washington, D.C.
[00:31:44.843 --> 00:31:48.926]  Because if they're not going to accept our ambassador, that's usually what you do right before a war happens.
[00:31:50.026 --> 00:31:50.326]  Correct.
[00:31:50.346 --> 00:31:52.609]  I mean, it's just unprecedented, the arrogance.
[00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:54.491]  Well, you look at arrogance in history.
[00:31:54.531 --> 00:32:05.562]  Hitler, as you know, just a week before he finally got, you know, killed or committed suicide there under the chancellery in Berlin, still thought he was going to beat the Russians and the Allies.
[00:32:06.463 --> 00:32:08.785]  Was totally delusional, and his people still believed him.
[00:32:09.085 --> 00:32:11.987]  Now, I think we're far from that, but we're getting close.
[00:32:12.307 --> 00:32:18.572]  Where nationalism's exploding, it's so popular, and this globalism is unelected, so disconnected, so corrupt.
[00:32:19.152 --> 00:32:27.719]  I mean, they're never going to be able to have this private corporate world government with a whole socialist bent to it, when there's opposition to it.
[00:32:28.439 --> 00:32:29.799]  They're losing ground everywhere.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.641]  They back the very worst actors like, you know, radical Islam.
[00:32:33.681 --> 00:32:38.062]  They're just horrible people who are so disconnected that they don't get it.
[00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:41.883]  So, I mean, I think we need to explain to them, you're going to lose.
[00:32:42.184 --> 00:32:52.747]  You need to get with the program and believe in humanity again, instead of having this eugenics view of, you know, cut off the resources and slave the people while they themselves live like kings.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:07.705 --> 00:37:08.365]  We just tuned in.
[00:37:08.385 --> 00:37:09.666]  A lot of radio stations are picking this up.
[00:37:10.006 --> 00:37:10.626]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:37:10.646 --> 00:37:11.527]  Billy Weaver is here with us.
[00:37:11.547 --> 00:37:17.970]  This is InfoWars News Center coverage from Austin, Texas, right in the middle, you know, southern middle of the country.
[00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:23.172]  Broadcasting worldwide on stations, TV, radio, UHF, VHF cable around the country.
[00:37:23.512 --> 00:37:26.354]  And President Trump, it's 8.03 Central, 9.03 Eastern.
[00:37:26.734 --> 00:37:29.435]  He's set to make an hour-long first address to Congress.
[00:37:29.955 --> 00:37:30.976]  This is not a State of the Union.
[00:37:31.016 --> 00:37:32.376]  This is a first address.
[00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:33.297]  Obama did this too.
[00:37:34.037 --> 00:37:35.878]  Uh, one of the first to do this in modern times.
[00:37:36.198 --> 00:37:38.699]  And so Trump obviously wants to show folks he's presidential.
[00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:40.160]  He's delivering on promises.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.542]  He wants to talk directly to the American people and say, help is on the way.
[00:37:44.102 --> 00:37:45.783]  Please, we want to unify everybody.
[00:37:46.123 --> 00:37:47.564]  Don't let the globalists sell us out.
[00:37:47.984 --> 00:37:48.804]  Here's Paul Ryan.
[00:37:48.964 --> 00:37:49.244]  Here we go.
[00:37:49.284 --> 00:37:58.769]  Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.
[00:38:07.705 --> 00:38:09.146]  The enemy of the American people.
[00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:09.346]  Yeah.
[00:38:09.366 --> 00:38:10.286]  The media.
[00:38:10.306 --> 00:38:10.926]  The media.
[00:38:11.527 --> 00:38:11.767]  The MSM.
[00:38:39.321 --> 00:38:42.822]  A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.
[00:38:43.623 --> 00:38:49.505]  And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.
[00:38:50.765 --> 00:38:55.287]  What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.
[00:38:56.627 --> 00:39:00.809]  Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.
[00:39:05.816 --> 00:39:11.862]  For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth
[00:39:12.844 --> 00:39:13.904]  Look at the Democrats.
[00:39:13.924 --> 00:39:18.426]  They work with foreign banks to make our money pour.
[00:39:18.506 --> 00:39:19.386]  They're just such scum.
[00:39:19.446 --> 00:39:19.686]  Sorry.
[00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:53.510]  And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
[00:39:55.151 --> 00:40:00.592]  Then in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.
[00:40:01.713 --> 00:40:02.953]  The rebellion started.
[00:40:03.783 --> 00:40:05.004]  As a quiet protest.
[00:40:05.624 --> 00:40:09.046]  Spoken by families of all colors and creeds.
[00:40:09.726 --> 00:40:12.988]  Families who just wanted a fair shot for their children.
[00:40:13.608 --> 00:40:16.749]  And a fair hearing for their concerns.
[00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:22.292]  But then, the quiet voices became a loud chorus.
[00:40:23.132 --> 00:40:26.094]  As thousands of citizens now spoke out together.
[00:40:26.694 --> 00:40:30.036]  From cities small and large all across our country.
[00:40:31.167 --> 00:40:34.130]  Finally, the chorus became an earthquake.
[00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.833]  And the people turned out by the tens of millions.
[00:40:38.494 --> 00:40:43.538]  And they were all united by one very simple but crucial demand.
[00:40:44.279 --> 00:40:47.462]  That America must put its own citizens first.
[00:40:47.522 --> 00:40:47.942]  That's right.
[00:40:47.982 --> 00:40:49.144]  Because only then
[00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:53.893]  Can we truly make America great again?
[00:40:53.913 --> 00:40:55.295]  I believe strongly in free trade.
[00:41:03.703 --> 00:41:06.686]  But it also has to be fair trade.
[00:41:06.886 --> 00:41:10.449]  It's been a long time since we had fair trade.
[00:41:10.629 --> 00:41:23.221]  The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.
[00:41:24.142 --> 00:41:29.227]  Lincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words.
[00:41:31.147 --> 00:41:34.170]  Can you imagine the prosperity our nation will have after this?
[00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.371]  Reagan didn't talk like this.
[00:41:35.431 --> 00:41:36.612]  Nobody ever exposed one side of deals.
[00:41:36.632 --> 00:41:43.438]  I would have thought that America and its great companies and workers be taking advantage of us any longer.
[00:41:43.719 --> 00:41:48.543]  They have taken advantage of our country no longer.
[00:41:50.177 --> 00:41:53.942]  Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people.
[00:41:54.162 --> 00:41:54.442]  That's right.
[00:41:54.462 --> 00:41:59.248]  And America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.
[00:41:59.268 --> 00:42:00.109]  It's happening in France.
[00:42:00.169 --> 00:42:02.512]  My job is not to represent the world.
[00:42:03.093 --> 00:42:06.597]  My job is to represent the United States of America.
[00:42:07.738 --> 00:42:08.299]  That's right.
[00:42:09.725 --> 00:42:12.526]  The time for small thinking is over.
[00:42:12.726 --> 00:42:13.126]  Beautiful.
[00:42:13.307 --> 00:42:16.788]  The time for trivial fights is behind us.
[00:42:17.148 --> 00:42:17.768]  Look at the Democrats.
[00:42:17.788 --> 00:42:30.994]  We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that serve our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.
[00:42:31.881 --> 00:42:39.912]  From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears.
[00:42:40.593 --> 00:42:48.705]  Inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded
[00:42:49.474 --> 00:42:50.415]  By our doubts.
[00:42:51.515 --> 00:42:57.499]  I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
[00:42:57.519 --> 00:43:05.184]  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country.
[00:43:06.285 --> 00:43:15.811]  I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment, believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe once more
[00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.971]  That's right.
[00:43:25.653 --> 00:43:26.533]  He's now president.
[00:43:26.834 --> 00:43:27.714]  He's delivering.
[00:43:28.294 --> 00:43:29.635]  It's almost surreal.
[00:43:29.975 --> 00:43:32.856]  But the enemies of freedom are even more snake-like than ever.
[00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:34.137]  Dr. Corsi.
[00:43:35.233 --> 00:43:36.895]  Well, it was a historic speech tonight.
[00:43:36.975 --> 00:43:44.762]  I think the tones that Donald Trump struck really reached across America and are unifying.
[00:43:44.782 --> 00:43:46.263]  I mean, it was an emotional speech.
[00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:54.611]  The Ryan Owens, I think, was historic, especially given the extent to which his father's objected to the raid in which his son was killed.
[00:43:55.152 --> 00:44:00.056]  There's his wife, clearly emotional, knowing what the sacrifices were for America.
[00:44:00.757 --> 00:44:12.185]  And Donald Trump is calling out to America to be our greater self, to bury these divisions, to restore the country, restore the economy of all the states of the union.
[00:44:12.245 --> 00:44:15.347]  I've heard in my life, I think this was the most memorable.
[00:44:15.367 --> 00:44:16.588]  I'm truly impressed by it.
[00:44:16.648 --> 00:44:18.909]  And yes, Donald Trump is the real deal.
[00:44:18.929 --> 00:44:20.350]  I've said that from the very beginning.
[00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:29.277]  I would have actually been in the chamber for 10 different state of the union addresses under three different presidents.
[00:44:30.148 --> 00:44:32.649]  But I've never seen anything like this.
[00:44:32.689 --> 00:44:57.961]  I think the president disarmed his critics right off the top by citing Black History Month, talking about these horrific desecrations in Jewish cemeteries, which is a disgrace, a blot, and also pointing out the killing, I guess it was in Kansas, kind of totally knocking his critics back on their heels and giving one of the most unexpected
[00:44:58.001 --> 00:45:00.564]  People were crying, there was emotion, it was electrical.
[00:45:10.031 --> 00:45:13.733]  Well, and he was a Reagan-style optimist.
[00:45:13.773 --> 00:45:16.414]  You saw the best of Donald Trump tonight.
[00:45:17.135 --> 00:45:22.778]  I'd also point out that he walked in in a perfectly tailored suit.
[00:45:23.258 --> 00:45:24.959]  Every hair was in place.
[00:45:25.019 --> 00:45:26.280]  He had a deep tan.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.162]  I heard one liberal pundit call it a presidential makeover.
[00:45:30.882 --> 00:45:38.805]  I'd love to sit there on the fence and just say, oh well he's not perfect on this or that and we'll see what happens and try to make Democrats happy and other people happy.
[00:45:39.325 --> 00:45:45.108]  Listen, I'm telling you, the whole New World Order is trying to plunge the economy right now and Trump has made...
[00:45:46.175 --> 00:45:55.881]  Thousands of phone calls a week and gotten the jobs back by the hundreds of billions of dollars and and and and trillions of the stock market and just Literally said we're over for business.
[00:45:55.942 --> 00:45:57.102]  We're dominating them.
[00:45:57.202 --> 00:46:05.128]  It's incredible to see their whole global system going down Everything we wanted the new world order in trouble global government trouble TPP shot down This is it.
[00:46:05.368 --> 00:46:07.829]  We would have rejoiced on the streets of TPP went down.
[00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.250]  Oh TPP.
[00:46:09.651 --> 00:46:13.613]  Oh you into those regulations Oh, you can shot down the $5,000 final number.
[00:46:13.813 --> 00:46:15.274]  What you gonna do next asshole.
[00:46:15.294 --> 00:46:16.135]  Excuse my friend
[00:46:16.715 --> 00:46:19.796]  And it's just like, you know, it's like, this is crazy.
[00:46:20.296 --> 00:46:21.757]  And I'm sure he's for real.
[00:46:21.897 --> 00:46:22.857]  I know he is.
[00:46:23.598 --> 00:46:25.378]  Not just the evidence, but my gut.
[00:46:25.838 --> 00:46:29.179]  And so all I'm saying is they're saying, kill him on all the major news channels.
[00:46:29.199 --> 00:46:30.040]  Nobody's getting in trouble.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.320]  If he said that about Obama, he'd be arrested in minutes.
[00:46:32.621 --> 00:46:33.021]  Or Bush.
[00:46:33.341 --> 00:46:39.203]  They, we tell you, the whole global system, from the Communist Chinese to that pedo, you know,
[00:46:40.183 --> 00:46:46.367]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.813 --> 00:48:50.493]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.056]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.076 --> 00:48:59.957]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.977 --> 00:49:00.017]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.567 --> 00:49:32.125]  Last night, Donald Trump's address became one of the most famous addresses to Congress ever, and even though I have to admit I was hoping that he was going to go a little harder, I was hoping he was going to come out with a little stronger rhetoric as far as his policies were concerned, but he delivered a unifying speech that you think would be able to unite all Americans, that all Americans could get behind, and I think that that's why he did it.
[00:49:32.785 --> 00:49:40.052]  And what we saw was that the left and the Democrats couldn't get behind it and they ended up really embarrassing themselves.
[00:49:40.413 --> 00:49:44.577]  I'm joined in studio by Leanne McAdoo and it's all across the board, Leanne.
[00:49:45.077 --> 00:49:45.738]  I don't know where to start.
[00:49:45.758 --> 00:49:49.181]  Let's start with Michael Moore because we've got plenty of these guys.
[00:49:49.221 --> 00:49:50.622]  Michael Moore says that
[00:49:51.403 --> 00:49:53.864]  President Trump is sick for honoring veterans.
[00:49:53.964 --> 00:49:55.604]  I mean, that's unbelievable.
[00:50:07.188 --> 00:50:07.608]  I don't
[00:50:26.155 --> 00:50:28.738]  That's the thing, is how can you spin this out of control?
[00:50:28.818 --> 00:50:38.870]  Meanwhile, these are the same people that rolled out the gold star father, Khazir Khan, and who used him as a puppet to get ratings and to spin a political agenda.
[00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:40.511]  He wasn't called an idiot.
[00:50:41.072 --> 00:50:43.013]  By ex-Hillary volunteer.
[00:50:43.093 --> 00:50:46.556]  He wasn't called an idiot by this person who targeted Corrine Owens.
[00:50:46.996 --> 00:50:52.560]  So he was actually applauded, lauded, and they tried to take Donald Trump down with that little bit of propaganda.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.182]  And let's recall, that's been a strategy of the Democrats.
[00:50:55.242 --> 00:51:01.246]  They even did it at the address, bringing Muslim Americans, immigrants, all of these political pawns.
[00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:02.967]  This is a typical move from the Democrats.
[00:51:03.047 --> 00:51:05.088]  So, of course, this is how desperate they are.
[00:51:05.488 --> 00:51:07.070]  But it's amazing to me because
[00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:15.713]  For me, this is something that is really unprecedented where Donald Trump gives the green light essentially on a mission in Yemen.
[00:51:16.113 --> 00:51:21.656]  We have a fallen soldier and he just puts the entire light on that shoulder.
[00:51:21.716 --> 00:51:27.698]  He makes sure that that soldier's name is known, that the widow is known, and that they are known as heroes.
[00:51:28.058 --> 00:51:30.099]  That's something we never saw from Obama.
[00:51:30.359 --> 00:51:35.661]  When people died in missions like this under Obama, you know, you had to go out and seek out who it was.
[00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:36.541]  Try to find it.
[00:51:36.601 --> 00:51:38.321]  You know, people on Twitter trying to raise awareness.
[00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:40.902]  You never had the President raising awareness for these fallen heroes.
[00:51:41.082 --> 00:51:41.282]  Right.
[00:51:41.502 --> 00:51:46.604]  Or showing up there with their caskets, you know, when they're brought to the airport with the flags laying over them.
[00:51:48.164 --> 00:51:50.747]  This was just kind of across the board.
[00:51:50.787 --> 00:51:52.328]  We saw the Democrats very sullen.
[00:51:52.348 --> 00:51:53.669]  They refused to stand.
[00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:56.272]  They didn't clap.
[00:51:56.352 --> 00:51:57.873]  They didn't give the standing ovation.
[00:51:58.414 --> 00:52:04.419]  But there were so many things that the Democrats refused to stand for, refused to clap for, and it was very telling.
[00:52:04.459 --> 00:52:08.503]  They really put themselves out there as the enemy of the American people.
[00:52:08.883 --> 00:52:13.605]  If there's anything that was not more clear after this address, it's that.
[00:52:13.725 --> 00:52:26.529]  It's that they have positioned themselves as the enemy of the American people, and it's just so interesting the things that they would not stand for when Donald Trump pointed out that his job is not to be the president of the world.
[00:52:26.969 --> 00:52:29.110]  His job is to be president of the United States of America.
[00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:30.631]  The Democrats did not like that.
[00:52:30.671 --> 00:52:32.091]  They didn't applaud him.
[00:52:32.131 --> 00:52:33.211]  They didn't stand up for that.
[00:52:33.251 --> 00:52:37.333]  They also didn't applaud when he said that we are all created by the same God.
[00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:38.013]  I don't
[00:52:58.055 --> 00:53:03.500]  The Democrats booing the Trump's proposal to give a voice to victims of illegal immigrant crime.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:16.792]  They audibly booed on that, and of course this is because they had their little illegal immigrants and immigrants guests that they had invited in, and so they had to kind of cow to their base there and say, you know,
[00:53:17.612 --> 00:53:31.449]  But seriously, he wanted to open up a victims of crime unit so that people who are victims of this immigrant crime can go somewhere and have a voice rather than just being hidden and silenced because they're trying to further this open borders agenda.
[00:53:31.889 --> 00:53:38.816]  Yeah, even in a third grade debate style tactic, they were actually doing the hand signaling of the thumbs down when he would say things.
[00:53:38.876 --> 00:53:39.576]  Thumbs down!
[00:53:39.596 --> 00:53:40.838]  It's like, what are we, in third grade here?
[00:53:41.258 --> 00:53:48.305]  And personally, for me, I thought that the moment with the Widow Owens was a tearjerker.
[00:53:48.465 --> 00:53:49.546]  A genuine tearjerker.
[00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:52.549]  It was something that we were on air for and I didn't tear up.
[00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:53.149]  I could have.
[00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:56.973]  But then later that night when I was watching the highlights of it and
[00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:57.434]  I'm good.
[00:54:07.742 --> 00:54:09.283]  You know, and I'm looking at the pictures.
[00:54:09.303 --> 00:54:11.485]  You look at the images of these Democrats.
[00:54:11.585 --> 00:54:13.687]  Nancy Pelosi is a perfect example.
[00:54:14.127 --> 00:54:20.053]  When Donald Trump is saying these pro-American things, talking about bringing jobs back, look at their faces.
[00:54:20.233 --> 00:54:21.874]  I can read their mind.
[00:54:21.914 --> 00:54:23.215]  I know exactly what they're thinking.
[00:54:23.275 --> 00:54:27.879]  It's, oh, I can't believe acting like Americans have it so bad.
[00:54:28.179 --> 00:54:31.582]  Why are these Republicans and Donald Trump acting like Americans have it so bad?
[00:54:31.622 --> 00:54:32.663]  They've got it so great.
[00:54:32.703 --> 00:54:33.224]  They're the best.
[00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:34.064]  Well, you know what?
[00:54:34.424 --> 00:54:35.324]  That may be true.
[00:54:35.565 --> 00:54:36.085]  But you know what?
[00:54:36.105 --> 00:54:38.285]  That's a birthright that people have died for.
[00:54:38.665 --> 00:54:40.906]  That's a birthright that people have gone to war for.
[00:54:41.266 --> 00:54:42.566]  And that's something to be proud of.
[00:54:42.626 --> 00:54:44.247]  Why would we not want to protect that?
[00:54:44.307 --> 00:54:56.350]  It's a social justice warrior mentality in 60- and 70-year-old people like Nancy Pelosi that are up here literally upset with the fact that people want to put America first.
[00:54:57.011 --> 00:55:03.118]  Right, and that's what I'm saying, is that they really put themselves out there as the enemy of the American people.
[00:55:03.138 --> 00:55:11.827]  They showed us what their priorities are, and Donald Trump's speech was all about coming together, let's work together, we need to truly stand by this.
[00:55:12.788 --> 00:55:28.991]  The campaign pledges that he made to make America great again, and asking Congress when he mentioned how Harley-Davidson, their attacks at 100% when they sell their products overseas, and that Harley-Davidson wasn't asking for change, but he is asking Congress for change.
[00:55:29.031 --> 00:55:33.072]  And so there he's kind of humbling himself a little bit, and I thought it was very refreshing.
[00:55:33.652 --> 00:55:41.074]  The night before the speech, he said he'd give himself a C, maybe a C+, in getting his message across to the American people.
[00:55:41.454 --> 00:55:53.425]  And I think that he was able to calmly relay what he's already done since getting elected and what he plans to continue to do, which is why we see CNN polls and everything.
[00:55:53.445 --> 00:55:56.628]  He has like skyrocketing approval rates.
[00:55:57.495 --> 00:55:58.175]  After that speech.
[00:55:58.335 --> 00:56:11.359]  And it really just shows how malleable Donald Trump is, where he can go right from the thank you tour, you know, doing the campaign style speech, all rowdy, get him, you know, get the crowd going, say the things that are politically incorrect.
[00:56:11.899 --> 00:56:18.281]  Then he goes into this speech and it's just totally presidential, totally on message, totally focused.
[00:56:18.601 --> 00:56:20.102]  The delivery was unbelievable.
[00:56:20.802 --> 00:56:26.864]  And it makes it, I think, really difficult for the Democrats to go through this process, but they've committed to it.
[00:56:27.364 --> 00:56:28.304]  That's the amazing thing.
[00:56:28.364 --> 00:56:29.625]  They're totally steadfast.
[00:56:29.685 --> 00:56:30.605]  They committed to sitting.
[00:56:30.645 --> 00:56:31.766]  They said, we're not going to stand.
[00:56:31.786 --> 00:56:32.626]  We're not going to cheer.
[00:56:33.026 --> 00:56:33.606]  They committed.
[00:56:34.167 --> 00:56:36.087]  And it was a group think type of thing.
[00:56:36.207 --> 00:56:37.128]  Everyone wore white.
[00:56:37.488 --> 00:56:43.650]  And of course, you've got the former Clinton volunteer that tweets the nastier mark, ends up deleting his entire Twitter because he's so embarrassed.
[00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:44.370]  Dan Grillo.
[00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:47.151]  But how about, I mean, there's a whole list.
[00:56:47.171 --> 00:56:49.632]  People are listing the things that Democrats didn't stand for.
[00:56:49.692 --> 00:56:53.594]  And as you said, that list is something that is just pro-American stances.
[00:56:53.874 --> 00:56:54.094]  Right.
[00:56:54.855 --> 00:56:55.596]  Right, exactly.
[00:56:55.656 --> 00:56:56.397]  That is the thing.
[00:56:56.877 --> 00:57:05.766]  You can't applaud when Donald Trump is talking about clean air, clean water, American jobs, giving a voice to victims of immigrant crime.
[00:57:06.647 --> 00:57:09.149]  Donald Trump actually saying that he's not the president of the world.
[00:57:09.169 --> 00:57:11.211]  Can you imagine if Hillary Clinton had won?
[00:57:11.932 --> 00:57:14.054]  She would not have been talking about America.
[00:57:14.214 --> 00:57:16.657]  She would have gladly said, you know what, if
[00:57:17.177 --> 00:57:21.600]  If you need me to be the president of the global order, I am here to do that.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.781]  I'll humbly accept your offer.
[00:57:24.121 --> 00:57:28.204]  She wouldn't have said, no, I don't want a one world government.
[00:57:28.404 --> 00:57:31.085]  You know, I'm here to be the representative of the American people.
[00:57:31.426 --> 00:57:33.107]  That for me was the most powerful part.
[00:57:33.827 --> 00:57:40.151]  And I thought, you know, it was really, he was able to silence his critics right away by bringing up all these attacks on Jewish
[00:57:40.831 --> 00:57:41.711]  I don't think so.
[00:58:07.642 --> 00:58:10.345]  Yeah, and it was almost as if he offered them an olive branch, too.
[00:58:10.405 --> 00:58:12.668]  He was looking at them, begging for unity.
[00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:18.074]  Kind of, as the speech went on, I think he was almost looking over there, kind of like, okay, really?
[00:58:18.114 --> 00:58:19.135]  You're still not going to stand?
[00:58:19.175 --> 00:58:20.337]  You're still not going to get behind this?
[00:58:20.737 --> 00:58:22.519]  And I'm not sure what they think this is going to do
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:23.660]  I think so.
