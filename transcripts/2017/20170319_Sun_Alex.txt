[00:00:06.653 --> 00:00:09.635]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is March 19, 2017.
[00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:10.196]  We're live.
[00:00:10.196 --> 00:00:15.219]  I'm going to have to air several special reports in the first hour because I'm working on a story that's so big.
[00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.483]  Plus, these are powerful special reports, including a CIA whistleblower on the surveillance of Trump.
[00:00:20.483 --> 00:00:34.893]  But it turns out, in public-admitted databases of illegal NSA spying that the EFF Foundation and others have looked into, that Sheriff Arpaio, an outgoing sheriff, and his chief detective on the cold case, Zulus, joining us later,
[00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:37.255]  Went through it and guess who's in it?
[00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:40.278]  That's right, Donald Trump being surveilled by Obama.
[00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:41.319]  Hiding in plain view.
[00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:42.620]  Oh, and myself too!
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.761]  First, a John Bowne report.
[00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:45.202]  Stay with us.
[00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:54.089]  German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the White House today to discuss shared economic goals between the United States and Germany.
[00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.011]  The talks began cordially enough.
[00:00:57.011 --> 00:00:59.794]  Chancellor Merkel, it is a great honor
[00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.470]  To welcome you to the People's House, the White House.
[00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:20.495]  I also appreciate Chancellor Merkel's leadership, along with the French President, to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, where we ideally seek a peaceful solution.
[00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:30.618]  Most importantly, our two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:32.934]  And to defeat ISIS.
[00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:44.854]  I applaud Chancellor Merkel for Germany's contributions, both civilian and military, as a counter-ISIS coalition member.
[00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:50.096]  We also recognize that immigration security is national security.
[00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:59.399]  We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism, and violence inside our borders.
[00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.260]  Immigration is a privilege, not a right.
[00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:10.690]  And the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.
[00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:27.019]  But when the topic shifted to the civil war of fake news plaguing the success of Donald Trump's staggering agenda, well, Merkel chose to embrace a globalist tone rather than the populist nationalism sweeping parts of Europe and the United States.
[00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:34.486]  We have a tremendous group of people that listen, and I can get around the media when the media doesn't tell the truth, so I like that.
[00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:43.235]  As far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps.
[00:02:49.691 --> 00:03:03.559]  Well, how dangerous do you think this isolationist policy of the US President is, what with the import terrorists that he plans, and also with the fact that he doesn't think the EU doesn't deal with the EU in a very respectful way?
[00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.041]  And Mr. President, America first.
[00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:09.303]  Don't you think that this is going to weaken also the European Union?
[00:03:09.303 --> 00:03:13.425]  And why are you so scared of diversity in the news?
[00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:16.067]  Nice, friendly reporter.
[00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:22.109]  First of all, I don't believe in an isolationist policy.
[00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.973]  But I also believe a policy of trade should be a fair policy.
[00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:31.119]  And the United States has been treated very, very unfairly by many countries over the years.
[00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:32.621]  And that's going to stop.
[00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:34.283]  But I'm not an isolationist.
[00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:36.586]  I'm a free trader, but I'm also a fair trader.
[00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:46.699]  The success of Germans has always been one where the German success is one side of the coin and the other side of the coin has been European unity and European integration.
[00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:52.326]  That's something of which I'm deeply convinced and I'm not only saying this back home, I'm saying this here and secondly,
[00:03:53.107 --> 00:04:00.653]  I believe that globalization ought to be shaped in an open-minded way, but also in a very fair way.
[00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:09.919]  Freedom of movement within the European Union, for example, is a very important element of our economic progress, of peace, has been for many, many decades.
[00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.643]  The European countries for many, many centuries waged wars against each other.
[00:04:14.643 --> 00:04:20.827]  Traffickers have to be stopped, but this has to be done by looking at the refugees as well.
[00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:25.051]  Giving them opportunities to shape their own lives where they are.
[00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:30.176]  Help countries who right now are not in an ability to do so.
[00:04:30.176 --> 00:04:31.577]  Sometimes because they have civil war.
[00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:34.179]  I think that's the right way of going about it.
[00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:36.762]  And this is obviously what we have an exchange of views about.
[00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:40.883]  President Trump stood strong in the face of globalist rhetoric.
[00:04:40.883 --> 00:04:49.227]  At this point, indifferent to the throngs of leftist propaganda stooges lobbing their curveballs at the Trump administration agenda.
[00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:53.928]  A little lesson to the globalists visiting the people's house in the future.
[00:04:53.928 --> 00:04:56.189]  This is our house, not yours.
[00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.890]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:04.735]  This is Ashley Beckford for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:06.336]  This is your tip of the week.
[00:05:06.336 --> 00:05:08.458]  Article from Mercola.com.
[00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:12.700]  Fluoride, the only drug intentionally added to your tap water.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:21.506]  Fluoride is an endocrine-disrupting, neurotoxic, and bone-weakening substance that the FDA defines as a drug when used to prevent disease.
[00:05:21.506 --> 00:05:27.670]  Because unlike the minerals we need, humans have no known physiological requirement for fluoride.
[00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:36.033]  Sodium fluoride, long known as an effective roach poison, is added to tablets and drops for the purpose of preventing tooth decay.
[00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:39.655]  In short, sodium fluoride is not a nutritional supplement.
[00:05:39.655 --> 00:05:42.816]  It is a prescription drug, and a dangerous one.
[00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:54.521]  FDA recently announced that marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates federal law because FDA never approved these products as either safe or effective.
[00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:56.422]  Don't use fluoride.
[00:05:56.422 --> 00:06:03.984]  Use the Alexa Pure water filter to remove contaminants from your water supply.
[00:06:03.984 --> 00:06:05.524]  You have the power!
[00:06:05.524 --> 00:06:07.505]  Humanity has the power!
[00:06:07.505 --> 00:06:08.665]  We have the power!
[00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:09.946]  Do you wanna fight?
[00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:14.367]  You better believe you got one!
[00:06:14.367 --> 00:06:19.388]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:06:19.388 --> 00:06:20.829]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.095 --> 00:06:32.176]  It's Sunday, March 19, 2017.
[00:06:32.176 --> 00:06:34.998]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:34.998 --> 00:06:39.022]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:41.384]  Now, if you just joined us, I did a short segment earlier.
[00:06:41.384 --> 00:06:45.748]  Some stations join us here in the second segment.
[00:06:45.748 --> 00:06:52.073]  I began to break down some of the massive news that we're about to break in the second hour of this broadcast today.
[00:06:52.073 --> 00:06:55.716]  Some of the biggest news we've broken in a long, long time.
[00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:57.217]  And we've broken other big stories.
[00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:04.982]  Like a hit-and-run, what appeared to be an attempted murder of Roger Stone earlier this week.
[00:07:04.982 --> 00:07:11.327]  It's finally in the Miami newspapers and broadcast television today that indeed the police are investigating it as that.
[00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:24.699]  Or when we get secret documents that Homeland Security says that veterans, gun owners, and Christians and conservatives are the number one threat to America, people didn't believe us for a week until Janet Napolitano came out and said, yeah, that's a real training manual.
[00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:25.380]  We stand by it.
[00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:38.236]  Obviously when we had Colonel Schaeffer on, very respected, but we had him on less than a week after Benghazi, and he laid out exactly what it took three years later for the information to come out.
[00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:53.225]  There are so many hundreds of examples of us breaking big national news here over and over again, like the fact that Hillary Clinton was falling down, having convulsions every 45 minutes or so, and then she was caught two weeks after I said that, on air,
[00:07:54.358 --> 00:08:21.651]  In a medical tent reportedly collapsed for 45 minutes and then the media made fun of us saying that and one week later on 9-11 she collapsed in front of the world and the media would only show her shaking about to fall and wouldn't show her actually falling on her face and would say we made that up hoping you didn't go look online and see the full video that we broke down and reported on that Drudge Report put out to the entire planet.
[00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:21.791]  So
[00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:26.647]  We break a lot of massive news here.
[00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:29.409]  Now, I knew about this database last week.
[00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:33.553]  I reported on the existence of it years ago.
[00:08:33.553 --> 00:08:49.646]  But we have, obviously, law enforcement sources that are very respected that we're giving the data and information to outgoing Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, good friends with President Trump and also Fearless, and his chief cold case investigator, Mike Zullo.
[00:08:51.837 --> 00:08:57.760]  Who has massive contacts on the East Coast, obviously, where he previously worked in law enforcement.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.224]  We're going to go with this tomorrow with Arpaio and Zula, but because of security issues, we just want to get it out now.
[00:09:04.224 --> 00:09:05.885]  I'm leaving it at that.
[00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:11.688]  And sooner couldn't be better, because this is big.
[00:09:11.688 --> 00:09:19.453]  Now, part of this is an admitted database in a program that was reported on by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, very respected, the London Guardian and others.
[00:09:23.086 --> 00:09:33.209]  When I saw the final draft this afternoon, I called Corsi and I called Merkel Phelan, who's our hacking internet specialist, and I said, I want to add a lot of stuff to this article that's background.
[00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:39.431]  But they admittedly, in the New York Times and Washington Post in January, said they were spying on President-elect and President Trump.
[00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:42.552]  With intercepts, wiretaps, you name it.
[00:09:42.552 --> 00:09:43.773]  Then they tried to walk that back.
[00:09:43.773 --> 00:09:45.574]  We're going to cover that today.
[00:09:45.574 --> 00:09:55.340]  I said I want that added into some context and I want to add it into context that the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee was spot on by the CIA five years ago.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.500]  Remember that huge controversy?
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.461]  Just search in.
[00:09:58.461 --> 00:09:58.762]  CIA
[00:10:00.444 --> 00:10:02.605]  Spied on Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:03.626]  Just type it in for yourself.
[00:10:03.626 --> 00:10:04.947]  In fact, I printed that Friday.
[00:10:04.947 --> 00:10:06.728]  Will you reprint that and pull it out of my stack?
[00:10:06.728 --> 00:10:09.650]  Because they just act like none of this is happening when it is happening.
[00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:14.553]  But we have the actual law enforcement NSA database.
[00:10:14.553 --> 00:10:21.197]  Now, the reason we have this is state police, the DEA, the FBI, and others.
[00:10:21.197 --> 00:10:22.238]  There's one in Guardian.
[00:10:22.238 --> 00:10:27.381]  The constitutional crisis, the CIA turns on the Senate, openly spying on them.
[00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:29.182]  Domestically, because they were worried about their budget.
[00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:31.114]  That's illegal.
[00:10:31.114 --> 00:10:31.674]  Print that for me.
[00:10:31.674 --> 00:10:31.954]  Thank you.
[00:10:31.954 --> 00:10:35.116]  That's September 2016, but that came out five years ago.
[00:10:35.116 --> 00:10:36.777]  That was first happening.
[00:10:36.777 --> 00:10:41.480]  So, they give access to these databases.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.063]  In fact, print me the article out of Associated Press three years ago, a headline,
[00:10:46.406 --> 00:10:52.949]  Is parallel construction, DEA involved in parallel construction, Yahoo News as well.
[00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:58.132]  That's where they have the NSA database for spying on people, but they can't use the NSA database domestically.
[00:10:58.132 --> 00:11:02.014]  So they have to go rebuild the case with the info they already have.
[00:11:02.014 --> 00:11:03.195]  I mean, they know you're a drug dealer.
[00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:04.455]  They know what you're doing.
[00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:05.496]  They know who you're supplying.
[00:11:05.496 --> 00:11:06.876]  They know what you're up to.
[00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:08.037]  Or maybe they're going to set you up.
[00:11:08.037 --> 00:11:08.897]  Maybe, maybe not.
[00:11:08.897 --> 00:11:15.581]  Maybe they're putting false info in the database, as the new Vault 7 CIA WikiLeaks shows, where they're framing Russia and others.
[00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:20.696]  Communist China is being used to frame Russia for, quote, us.
[00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:21.457]  That's the globalist.
[00:11:21.457 --> 00:11:24.038]  Oh, America's pretty much run by the Communist Chinese right now.
[00:11:24.038 --> 00:11:26.740]  It's truly sickening.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.102]  Our elites have sold us out to them.
[00:11:30.102 --> 00:11:32.983]  They're the ones with North Korea opening and threatening to nuke the U.S.
[00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:33.424]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:11:33.424 --> 00:11:34.064]  Reuters.
[00:11:34.064 --> 00:11:34.664]  Exclusive.
[00:11:34.664 --> 00:11:35.445]  U.S.
[00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.427]  directs agents to cover up programs used to investigate Americans.
[00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:40.348]  Print me that solid gold!
[00:11:41.806 --> 00:11:57.976]  So what's happening here is, as the head guy at InfoWars, I don't really act as an editor, Paul Watson does, and so does Dr. Korsi on his own pieces in our Washington Bureau, but I saw his article and it was so powerful, I said, listen, you're going to have to not give up sources here, but they already know how you're getting this.
[00:11:57.976 --> 00:11:58.797]  This is no secret.
[00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:01.479]  This is from state police, DEA, things like that.
[00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:02.259]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.584]  They're able to get into the database of who's already been spied on without a warrant in these quote, Dragnet operations.
[00:12:11.584 --> 00:12:15.888]  NSA files decoded Edward Snowden surveillance revelations explained.
[00:12:15.888 --> 00:12:19.230]  Dragnet NSA spying survives 2015 review.
[00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.712]  Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:12:21.712 --> 00:12:23.633]  Very respected.
[00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:25.034]  What's the news we've got?
[00:12:25.034 --> 00:12:28.597]  And I'm holding publishing this till next hour till we've added all these links.
[00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:30.118]  Because of course, of course he's a type of journalist.
[00:12:30.118 --> 00:12:33.741]  He just gives you our breaking report, our info that's bombshell,
[00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:43.318]  I want, when the media tries to pick it apart, I want to have all the other admissions of, oh, they were ordered to illegally cover up their illegal, you know, activities in America.
[00:12:43.318 --> 00:12:44.799]  Oh, they're spying on everybody.
[00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:46.099]  Oh, here's London Guardian.
[00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:46.959]  Oh, here's Reuters.
[00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:49.500]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, here's the Senate Committee admitting it.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.381]  Oh, oh, oh.
[00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:52.881]  How's that feel?
[00:12:52.881 --> 00:12:54.202]  Before we give you the big enchilada.
[00:12:58.851 --> 00:13:14.160]  We've not just received the data of the Dragnet, our law enforcement services, who are patriots in many cases, have given our sources, who are impeccable, the database excerpts, and we have them.
[00:13:15.222 --> 00:13:17.563]  And by the way, we could be SWAT team ready at any minute for this.
[00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:19.763]  But again, we have President Trump now who wants law and order.
[00:13:19.763 --> 00:13:21.683]  So, there's still criminal elements in the government.
[00:13:21.683 --> 00:13:22.664]  We don't know what's going to happen.
[00:13:22.664 --> 00:13:25.084]  This is all done in the interest of the Republic and the truth.
[00:13:25.084 --> 00:13:32.426]  We have President Trump being surveilled by Obama, previous to even running for the presidency.
[00:13:32.426 --> 00:13:38.107]  And then it cuts off and the rest has not been put in the database since then for these law enforcement groups.
[00:13:38.107 --> 00:13:39.607]  We only have the database up until 2015.
[00:13:39.607 --> 00:13:40.427]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:13:44.787 --> 00:13:54.191]  We've got Barack Obama spying on the Trump kids, the Trump wife, particularly interested in the Trump's daughter.
[00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:57.833]  Oh, and guess who else is in the database?
[00:13:57.833 --> 00:14:02.375]  A guy named Alex Jones.
[00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:07.738]  My private cell phone number, our little shadow office, all of it is in there.
[00:14:09.062 --> 00:14:11.183]  So, very interesting.
[00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:14.324]  I'm getting calls by these law enforcement guys, and they're like, yeah, is this your number?
[00:14:14.324 --> 00:14:14.964]  Is this your address?
[00:14:14.964 --> 00:14:15.144]  Yeah.
[00:14:15.144 --> 00:14:17.125]  I'm like, of course it's my number.
[00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:21.526]  You're talking to me on it.
[00:14:21.526 --> 00:14:23.227]  And I guess they just went live with it.
[00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:25.027]  You know, that's fine.
[00:14:25.027 --> 00:14:32.150]  But I talked to them an hour ago and 30 minutes ago and 15 minutes ago before I went on air, and I said, wait, because I want to add all that.
[00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.770]  But it's fine.
[00:14:33.618 --> 00:14:48.070]  It's now going live on InfoWars.com, and we're going to add some of the background to that information, but we also probably need to clip out this little segment of the live show and add this into the piece, but as it explains it and breaks it all down.
[00:14:48.070 --> 00:15:02.041]  But we've put this out a day early because of security concern issues, because let's just say behind the scenes, some stuff broke loose once they were obviously listening to our phones last week we were talking about this.
[00:15:05.273 --> 00:15:08.817]  And with most people, you're just being recorded and it's in a database and then go back to it later.
[00:15:08.817 --> 00:15:14.324]  You're talking about Sheriff Arpaio or myself or Dr. Corsi who's up there with his nose and everything in D.C.
[00:15:14.324 --> 00:15:16.767]  They're spying on everybody in real time.
[00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:18.650]  And of course, Trump knows what's going on.
[00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.711]  He's ordering them to stop.
[00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:20.232]  They won't stop.
[00:15:21.971 --> 00:15:25.373]  People kept saying, you know, Trump's going to learn he was a victim of all this illegal spying.
[00:15:25.373 --> 00:15:26.254]  He's going to stand up against it.
[00:15:26.254 --> 00:15:27.475]  And now it's happening.
[00:15:27.475 --> 00:15:29.676]  And he's this big champion against it.
[00:15:29.676 --> 00:15:36.321]  And the media is trying to act like, with the Snowden movie that came out and all the rest of it and all the documents, that none of this is true or happening.
[00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:40.003]  You know, they make fun of Conway for saying your appliance is spying on you when it's all over the news.
[00:15:40.003 --> 00:15:42.705]  And it's in the new database dump.
[00:15:42.705 --> 00:15:43.986]  And I'm told more is coming.
[00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:48.048]  But this is not from the latest Vault 7.
[00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:48.949]  It's not from the other stuff.
[00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:51.771]  This is directly from law enforcement to our sources.
[00:15:53.132 --> 00:15:54.673]  And it's a big, big deal.
[00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:56.795]  More breaking straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[00:15:56.795 --> 00:15:59.557]  Infowars.com has at least the first portion up.
[00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:06.935]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:16:06.935 --> 00:16:10.138]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:16:10.138 --> 00:16:15.743]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:21.848]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:25.151]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.612]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:16:26.792 --> 00:16:31.094]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:16:31.094 --> 00:16:34.035]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.696]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:16:35.696 --> 00:16:39.137]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:16:39.137 --> 00:16:41.738]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:16:41.738 --> 00:16:42.799]  It's in powder form.
[00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:45.680]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.400]  I take this.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.201]  This is the product that I take.
[00:16:48.201 --> 00:16:50.182]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:16:51.002 --> 00:16:52.944]  We fight the global, we fight the new world order.

[00:16:59.368 --> 00:17:02.110]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.151]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:07.054]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:17:07.054 --> 00:17:13.118]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:20.483]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[00:17:20.603 --> 00:17:22.285]  Alex, a pure breeze.
[00:17:22.285 --> 00:17:29.833]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:37.862]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:17:37.862 --> 00:17:38.824]  The general public doesn't.
[00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:43.409]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:17:43.409 --> 00:17:47.552]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:17:47.552 --> 00:17:54.257]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:17:54.257 --> 00:17:58.360]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:02.742 --> 00:18:08.226]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:18:08.226 --> 00:18:09.066]  I take this.
[00:18:09.066 --> 00:18:10.207]  My family takes this.
[00:18:10.207 --> 00:18:14.490]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:18.693]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:18:19.093 --> 00:18:23.715]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:24.855]  I don't feel good.
[00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:28.596]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:18:28.596 --> 00:18:31.297]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:37.100]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.061]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:18:40.061 --> 00:18:43.602]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:18:43.602 --> 00:18:45.843]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:18:45.843 --> 00:18:46.183]  I love it.
[00:18:46.343 --> 00:18:49.144]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:18:49.144 --> 00:18:50.165]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:18:50.165 --> 00:18:55.807]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:18:55.807 --> 00:18:57.988]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:18:57.988 --> 00:19:00.189]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.971]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:10.574]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:19:10.574 --> 00:19:13.736]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:23.500]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.361]  Caveman.
[00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:29.423]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:19:29.423 --> 00:19:31.524]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:19:31.824 --> 00:19:34.985]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:19:34.985 --> 00:19:40.125]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:48.187]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:56.028]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:19:56.028 --> 00:20:00.849]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and fullwarslives.com today.
[00:20:04.445 --> 00:20:07.038]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.417 --> 00:20:25.558]  Big Brother.
[00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.359]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.301]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:29.301 --> 00:20:30.942]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:30.942 --> 00:20:32.603]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:32.603 --> 00:20:39.768]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:39.768 --> 00:20:49.936]  Mike Zullo, Dr. Jerome Corsi, both men have broken scores of giant international news stories over the years, are joining us in the second hour.
[00:20:52.805 --> 00:21:09.134]  We've put out the first basic boil down with even more added documentation being added as we speak by Markel Phelan to Infowars.com and the story NSA database documents NSA electronic surveillance of Donald Trump in Trump Tower and Alex Jones in Texas.
[00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:16.578]  Now ladies and gentlemen these databases here it is out of the New York Times inquiry by CIA affirms it's spied on Senate panel.
[00:21:16.578 --> 00:21:16.978]  Remember that in 2014?
[00:21:20.077 --> 00:21:21.218]  There it is, okay?
[00:21:21.218 --> 00:21:21.899]  This goes on.
[00:21:21.899 --> 00:21:23.481]  They think you're stupid.
[00:21:23.481 --> 00:21:25.403]  And of course, Trump has the same sources we have.
[00:21:25.403 --> 00:21:26.083]  He's the president.
[00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:27.565]  He knows he's in the databases.
[00:21:27.565 --> 00:21:30.148]  He now knows he's been spied on for decades, okay?
[00:21:30.148 --> 00:21:31.129]  Including by Obama.
[00:21:31.129 --> 00:21:33.271]  We have the entries.
[00:21:33.271 --> 00:21:34.472]  A constitutional crisis.
[00:21:34.472 --> 00:21:36.274]  The CIA turns on the Senate.
[00:21:36.274 --> 00:21:36.955]  The London Guardian.
[00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:39.687]  So that's the Senate being spied on.
[00:21:39.687 --> 00:21:40.367]  Exclusive.
[00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:40.587]  U.S.
[00:21:40.587 --> 00:21:43.548]  directs agents to cover up a program used to investigate Americans.
[00:21:43.548 --> 00:21:44.068]  Reuters.
[00:21:44.068 --> 00:21:45.929]  With illegal NSA databases.
[00:21:45.929 --> 00:21:48.710]  Being given to federal and state law enforcement.
[00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.271]  CIA accused of spying on U.S.
[00:21:50.271 --> 00:21:51.211]  Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:51.532]  Reuters.
[00:21:51.532 --> 00:21:51.952]  Confirmed.
[00:21:51.952 --> 00:21:54.213]  I'm just giving you background here.
[00:21:54.213 --> 00:21:57.374]  When they play dumb and say Trump has no proof, he's crazy.
[00:21:57.374 --> 00:22:00.695]  And they get all these people in the Senate and the House to say it's so.
[00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.816]  That's because they're desperate.
[00:22:02.816 --> 00:22:04.577]  Well, law enforcement
[00:22:05.811 --> 00:22:13.901]  Who has access to these databases of who's been ordered, surveilled, and then who can get access to that surveillance, different agencies, and Donald Trump is in there.
[00:22:13.901 --> 00:22:18.646]  You can see where, when, and how, month after month, year after year.
[00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:25.374]  It gets cut off a few years ago, but it's got Obama and Bush, W, spying on Donald Trump.
[00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:28.819]  Running from 2008 right down.
[00:22:28.819 --> 00:22:31.202]  So, you want to see it for yourself.
[00:22:31.202 --> 00:22:34.546]  The phone numbers, the back of the... And by the way, I've known some of Donald Trump's phone numbers.
[00:22:34.546 --> 00:22:35.087]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.689]  It's Donald Trump's phone number.
[00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:39.512]  I've dialed that number.
[00:22:39.512 --> 00:22:40.393]  I've got that number.
[00:22:40.393 --> 00:22:41.294]  He no longer uses it.
[00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:47.462]  One of them is just a direct line into Trump Tower and into his secretary.
[00:22:47.462 --> 00:22:49.264]  So, this is the real deal.
[00:22:49.264 --> 00:22:50.504]  And of course, he knows about this.
[00:22:50.504 --> 00:22:51.505]  He's friends with Arpaio.
[00:22:51.505 --> 00:22:57.489]  Arpaio and, of course, Mike are looking into all this and doing the investigation.
[00:22:57.489 --> 00:23:00.671]  Now, in this segment and the next, because I've got to get off the air.
[00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:01.992]  Plus, I was already going to air these clips.
[00:23:01.992 --> 00:23:03.993]  They're so important from Friday's show.
[00:23:03.993 --> 00:23:06.775]  I've got to go work on this because there's a lot I want added to the story.
[00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:09.996]  I want to add where the DEA admits they're getting illegal stuff from the NSA.
[00:23:09.996 --> 00:23:11.817]  I want to add where the state police are.
[00:23:11.817 --> 00:23:14.598]  I want to add where they're going after journalists with this stuff.
[00:23:14.598 --> 00:23:17.279]  I want to add where they're using it for blackmail.
[00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:19.400]  Mainstream News now thinks you're dumb.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:32.225]  And I want to add screenshots of the New York Times, the 19th, the 20th, the 21st, with the reporters at the New York Times on CNN saying, we never heard of this, it's insane, when they wrote articles saying it in the headline.
[00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:34.192]  So we've got them here.
[00:23:34.192 --> 00:23:39.695]  They're trying to just totally scam everybody like Gruber did with Obamacare, saying, thank God you're so stupid.
[00:23:39.695 --> 00:23:41.776]  Well, you're not so stupid.
[00:23:41.776 --> 00:23:46.219]  Flashback, New York Times admits that there was wiretapping of President Trump.
[00:23:46.219 --> 00:23:54.524]  That's all being added in, previous background of the article that just went up on Infowars.com that needs to go completely and totally viral.
[00:23:55.874 --> 00:23:59.297]  Again, whistleblowing is covered if it's covering illegal information.
[00:23:59.297 --> 00:24:09.306]  If you're illegally surveilling Donald Trump, the businessman, and Alex Jones, the radio host, slash TV host, his wife, his family, for a decade.
[00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:13.049]  And Obama's part of this.
[00:24:13.049 --> 00:24:15.712]  Oh, and by the way, I told you Friday that Trump had to apologize.
[00:24:15.712 --> 00:24:16.753]  There was no statement of that.
[00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:20.997]  And then Spicer came out and said, the President has apologized to the British.
[00:24:20.997 --> 00:24:24.839]  He knows for a fact they used the GSGQ to spy on us and we spy on them.
[00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:26.059]  That's part of it.
[00:24:26.059 --> 00:24:27.400]  That's admitted.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:36.144]  So here is the CIA top-level individual, also from the State Department, Deputy Head of Counterterrorism, Larry C. Johnson.
[00:24:36.144 --> 00:24:39.765]  He used to be a Fox News contributor until he wouldn't shut up about this.
[00:24:39.765 --> 00:24:42.527]  Coming on the show Friday to break it down in an hour interview.
[00:24:42.527 --> 00:24:45.268]  We're going to air five minutes of it now, five minutes when we come back.
[00:24:46.024 --> 00:24:52.966]  And then we're going to break down just how big a deal this is with Obama denying all this, and here it is!
[00:24:52.966 --> 00:25:03.030]  They're admitting they were doing it in 2016, then they tried to deny it, but now we have the actual database documents where they were doing it years before!
[00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.051]  At Trump Tower!
[00:25:05.051 --> 00:25:08.252]  And I just can't believe I'm in the database too, but isn't that just cute?
[00:25:10.902 --> 00:25:16.163]  I've seen federal court cases where they use stuff from the government database on people they're going after that have been guests of mine, and it comes up.
[00:25:16.163 --> 00:25:17.704]  So I guess I've seen this before.
[00:25:17.704 --> 00:25:21.064]  I mean, we know we're getting surveilled, but my goodness, in there with Donald Trump.
[00:25:21.064 --> 00:25:22.345]  But see, they know who to watch, folks.
[00:25:22.345 --> 00:25:24.005]  They know who the patriots are.
[00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:25.746]  So let's go ahead and go to this report.
[00:25:25.746 --> 00:25:26.466]  They don't want you to see.
[00:25:26.466 --> 00:25:30.787]  By the way, this got censored off Facebook when he was first interviewed by RT.
[00:25:30.787 --> 00:25:31.047]  Here it is.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:51.066]  Donald Trump is in essence correct that the intelligence agencies and some in the law enforcement community on the side of the FBI were in fact illegally trying to access, monitor his communications with his aides and with other people.
[00:25:51.066 --> 00:25:55.147]  All of this with an end to trying to destroy and discredit his presidency.
[00:26:04.645 --> 00:26:09.729]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:26:09.729 --> 00:26:15.313]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[00:26:15.313 --> 00:26:31.706]  The real fundamental thing that ought to alarm all Americans, regardless of their political party, their political affiliation, is what has been going on with former leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency and in the director of National Intelligence Agency's office.
[00:26:32.546 --> 00:26:37.051]  Is direct interference in the domestic politics.
[00:26:37.051 --> 00:26:39.734]  If we're going to talk about Russian meddling in U.S.
[00:26:39.734 --> 00:26:47.982]  politics, then it needs to be acknowledged that these intelligence agencies or the principals at the top were involved with meddling.
[00:26:47.982 --> 00:26:50.985]  Now, do I have first-hand knowledge that John Brennan was doing this?
[00:26:50.985 --> 00:26:51.506]  No, I do not.
[00:26:52.841 --> 00:27:01.447]  I have been told, though, by someone who is in a position to know, who's still within the intelligence community, that absolutely that's what was going on.
[00:27:01.447 --> 00:27:08.272]  That Brennan, and that there are shenanigans going on between the GHCQ and U.S.
[00:27:08.272 --> 00:27:09.252]  intelligence.
[00:27:09.252 --> 00:27:10.373]  How does that work?
[00:27:10.373 --> 00:27:21.701]  Your listeners should understand that it is illegal, without some warrant, for any of the intelligence or law enforcement agencies to collect on American citizens.
[00:27:22.601 --> 00:27:33.108]  It is not illegal for the British, through their version of NSA, to collect on American citizens because we're foreigners as far as they're concerned and we're a legitimate target.
[00:27:33.108 --> 00:27:40.492]  Similarly, the United States can freely collect on any British citizen because they're not Americans.
[00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:42.273]  They don't have the constitutional protection.
[00:27:42.273 --> 00:27:43.514]  We all spy on each other then.
[00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:44.809]  Yeah.
[00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:59.476]  I mean, you know, if anybody's so naive as to think that the Brits aren't spying on Americans and Americans aren't spying on Brits, well, you know, I hate to burst your bubble, but the reality is that's what spy agencies do.
[00:27:59.476 --> 00:28:02.837]  They collect and gather intelligence on other entities.
[00:28:02.837 --> 00:28:03.778]  That's one of their purposes.
[00:28:03.778 --> 00:28:10.581]  Well, remember the scandal just four years ago where the CIA was spying on Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, the Intelligence Committee heads.
[00:28:11.291 --> 00:28:20.601]  Right, well and that was, you know, John Brennan again had his fingerprints all over that because they didn't want the information about the torture report to come out.
[00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:26.928]  And Brennan initially denied that that was going on and then later had to admit that it had in fact happened.
[00:28:26.928 --> 00:28:31.253]  So, it's not, you know, we're not raising these allegations without precedent.
[00:28:31.633 --> 00:28:43.760]  Director Brennan, in 2014, the CIA conducted an unauthorized search of Senate files, including the emails of Senate staff investigating the CIA's use of torture.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:50.003]  The CIA Inspector General later stated that the search involved improper agency access.
[00:28:50.003 --> 00:28:53.025]  All right, folks, we're going to be back after this quick break.
[00:28:53.025 --> 00:28:54.726]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:54.726 --> 00:28:59.449]  Major news on the illegal NSA spying on Donald Trump by Obama now confirmed.
[00:29:00.433 --> 00:29:05.475]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[00:30:02.646 --> 00:30:04.608]  What happened to America?
[00:30:04.608 --> 00:30:05.769]  They lost.
[00:30:05.769 --> 00:30:07.091]  We won.
[00:30:07.091 --> 00:30:08.893]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[00:30:08.893 --> 00:30:16.361]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[00:30:17.125 --> 00:30:22.952]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[00:30:22.952 --> 00:30:29.099]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[00:30:29.099 --> 00:30:35.406]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[00:30:35.406 --> 00:30:37.849]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[00:30:38.109 --> 00:30:39.290]  We're the solution!
[00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:40.271]  Americans!
[00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:41.812]  Ain't nothing more to it than that!
[00:30:41.812 --> 00:30:47.197]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[00:30:47.197 --> 00:30:48.858]  The ethical screening's on demand.
[00:30:48.858 --> 00:30:50.380]  DVD's now available.
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:54.223]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[00:30:54.223 --> 00:30:56.385]  Americans need to see this film.
[00:31:01.249 --> 00:31:09.517]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[00:31:09.517 --> 00:31:10.738]  A 360 win.
[00:31:10.738 --> 00:31:17.304]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[00:31:17.304 --> 00:31:24.811]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:29.894]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:31:29.894 --> 00:31:36.399]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:44.184]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:31:44.184 --> 00:31:51.388]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:31:51.388 --> 00:31:52.209]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:31:52.349 --> 00:31:54.791]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:56.772]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:31:56.772 --> 00:32:00.895]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:32:00.895 --> 00:32:05.358]  We have the new product at Infowarslife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:32:05.358 --> 00:32:16.285]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:32:16.465 --> 00:32:21.508]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:32:21.508 --> 00:32:24.089]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:32:24.089 --> 00:32:25.790]  It helps detoxify.
[00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.672]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:32:28.672 --> 00:32:33.454]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:32:33.454 --> 00:32:39.698]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:32:39.698 --> 00:32:45.040]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:45.801]  I'm taking it now.
[00:32:45.981 --> 00:32:48.243]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:18.374 --> 00:33:20.495]  Big Brother.
[00:33:20.495 --> 00:33:23.276]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:23.276 --> 00:33:25.796]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:25.796 --> 00:33:27.777]  Do you want answers?
[00:33:27.777 --> 00:33:29.697]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:29.697 --> 00:33:36.159]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:39.420]  Project Dragnet is admitted to have existed.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.541]  Now we've got part of the database from our law enforcement
[00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:41.981]  This is
[00:34:02.275 --> 00:34:04.257]  Who has been censored all over the news.
[00:34:04.257 --> 00:34:11.022]  Former Fox News contributor Larry C. Johnson with his current sources saying Trump was under surveillance during the campaign.
[00:34:11.022 --> 00:34:14.065]  But we have documents that Obama was surveilling Trump.
[00:34:14.065 --> 00:34:16.227]  We have the actual targeting documents.
[00:34:16.227 --> 00:34:18.628]  That's breaking now at Infowars.com.
[00:34:18.628 --> 00:34:20.650]  Here it is.
[00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:29.918]  In 2014, the CIA conducted an unauthorized search of Senate files, including the emails of Senate staff investigating the CIA's use of torture.
[00:34:30.638 --> 00:34:45.711]  The CIA Inspector General later stated that the search involved improper agency access to Senate files, and a review board that you appointed concluded that the search resulted in inappropriate access to the committee's work product.
[00:34:45.931 --> 00:35:01.198]  Senior officials from the NSA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have all testified that it would be inappropriate for their agencies to secretly search Senate files without external authorization.
[00:35:01.198 --> 00:35:08.982]  Would you agree that the CIA's 2014 search of Senate files was improper?
[00:35:09.702 --> 00:35:22.201]  The actions of the CIA were reasonable, given the very unclear and unwritten or unspecific understanding between the committee and CIA at the time.
[00:35:22.201 --> 00:35:25.145]  The exact words of the review board were...
[00:35:25.686 --> 00:35:31.249]  It resulted in inappropriate access to SSCI work product.
[00:35:31.249 --> 00:35:34.491]  And your Inspector General reached the same conclusion.
[00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:40.414]  And so, that undermines the very checks and balances that protect our democracy.
[00:35:40.414 --> 00:35:43.056]  And it's unacceptable in a free society.
[00:35:43.056 --> 00:35:47.378]  And your compatriots in all of the sister agencies agreed with that.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.719]  Now, you disagree?
[00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:52.161]  Yes, I think you've mischaracterized both their comments as well as what's in those reports.
[00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:55.562]  Do not say that we spied on Senate computers or your files.
[00:35:55.562 --> 00:35:56.643]  We did not do that.
[00:35:56.643 --> 00:35:58.624]  We were fulfilling our responsibilities.
[00:35:58.624 --> 00:36:08.629]  My concern here is that involving intelligence agencies and domestic politics takes us down a very, very dangerous road.
[00:36:08.629 --> 00:36:17.533]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:36:17.533 --> 00:36:19.414]  No, sir.
[00:36:19.414 --> 00:36:19.894]  It does not?
[00:36:21.832 --> 00:36:24.032]  Not wittingly.
[00:36:24.032 --> 00:36:31.194]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.
[00:36:31.194 --> 00:36:35.415]  But I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn't lied to anyone.
[00:36:35.415 --> 00:36:40.336]  He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution.
[00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:46.357]  And he believes that when James Clapper came in March, our National Director of Intelligence, came and lied,
[00:36:47.057 --> 00:36:51.162]  That he was simply coming forward and telling the truth that your government was lying.
[00:36:51.162 --> 00:37:03.256]  And this is a big concern of mine because it makes me doubt the administration and their word to us when they come and talk to us because they have now admitted that they will lie to us if they think it's in the name of national security.
[00:37:05.218 --> 00:37:12.302]  Uh, this New York Times writer, I want to play a short clip where he claims Trump got the idea from me that there was wiretapping.
[00:37:12.302 --> 00:37:14.202]  No, it was in the New York Times.
[00:37:14.202 --> 00:37:20.085]  I mean, I've never seen such attempts at just bizarre, you know, the sun is in the sky at noon.
[00:37:20.085 --> 00:37:24.788]  I don't know as a CIA guy what you'd call this, but it's just like the worst gaslighting I've ever seen.
[00:37:24.788 --> 00:37:25.408]  Let's play this clip.
[00:37:26.451 --> 00:37:32.272]  What do you make of the White House citing your article as part of the evidence?
[00:37:32.272 --> 00:37:35.853]  I mean, it's getting bizarre at this point.
[00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:40.094]  We've said it very clearly, and I said on your show, that that's not what the story said.
[00:37:40.094 --> 00:37:43.135]  Anybody can read the story and see that's not what it said.
[00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:52.137]  And so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped, which developed on this kind of fringe right-wing media.
[00:37:53.615 --> 00:37:57.057]  There it is, there's the, there it is, and he wrote an article the day before!
[00:37:57.057 --> 00:38:03.900]  After his tweet storm, InfoWars then started saying, well, look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:09.703]  And now, a few weeks later, the White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[00:38:09.703 --> 00:38:16.427]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right-wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right-wing fringe theory, both of which there's no evidence to support.
[00:38:16.787 --> 00:38:29.677]  And just to be clear, there is, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then-candidate Trump, correct?
[00:38:29.677 --> 00:38:30.058]  Nothing!
[00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:32.339]  I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story!
[00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:35.652]  That's a fantastic story.
[00:38:35.652 --> 00:38:36.993]  It was all over CNN everywhere.
[00:38:36.993 --> 00:38:37.833]  We have the intercepts.
[00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:39.034]  We've caught General Flynn.
[00:38:39.034 --> 00:38:39.914]  He better resign.
[00:38:39.914 --> 00:38:41.035]  We have the transcript.
[00:38:41.035 --> 00:38:42.976]  Then they wouldn't release it because there was nothing there.
[00:38:42.976 --> 00:38:44.557]  He was lining up a phone call.
[00:38:44.557 --> 00:38:46.918]  We're showing you the articles of your radio listener.
[00:38:46.918 --> 00:38:49.319]  Intercept Russian communications.
[00:38:49.319 --> 00:38:51.280]  Part of inquiry into Trump.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.522]  Matthew Rosenberg and phone calls from Trump Tower being intercepted.
[00:38:55.522 --> 00:38:57.343]  Man, that guy.
[00:38:57.343 --> 00:38:59.644]  What would you call Mr. Rosenberg politically?
[00:38:59.644 --> 00:39:01.045]  I mean, what is he doing there?
[00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.392]  A disinformation specialist?
[00:39:05.392 --> 00:39:08.895]  Look, he faults Donald Trump for being able to read?
[00:39:08.895 --> 00:39:20.863]  I mean, your listeners and those who are watching, the headline simply states, wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.
[00:39:20.863 --> 00:39:23.325]  Donald Trump didn't write that headline.
[00:39:23.325 --> 00:39:25.827]  Alex Jones didn't write that headline.
[00:39:25.827 --> 00:39:28.289]  That was written by this guy, and then the guy who writes it,
[00:39:28.709 --> 00:39:33.550]  Has the audacity to claim, well, this is somebody else's fault.
[00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:39.552]  I mean, you know, we are living in such a surreal, dangerous time.
[00:39:39.552 --> 00:39:47.714]  It's literally the world that, you know, we read about as children in Alice in Wonderland that was a fictional world.
[00:39:48.214 --> 00:39:58.598]  We're now seeing it in real time, where objective facts are suddenly dismissed as being right-wing conspiracy theories.
[00:39:58.598 --> 00:40:05.661]  And it's just, you know, to me it's alarming because it really threatens the foundation of our republic.
[00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:24.660]  Donald Trump is in essence correct that the intelligence agencies and some in the law enforcement community on the side of the FBI were in fact illegally trying to access, monitor his communications with his aides and with other people.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:30.145]  All of this with an end to trying to destroy and discredit his presidency.
[00:40:30.145 --> 00:40:31.906]  I don't think there will be any doubt of that.
[00:40:31.906 --> 00:40:44.057]  I think it's worth noting that the head of the National Security Agency, an Admiral Rogers, made a journey to Trump Tower shortly after Trump had won.
[00:40:44.057 --> 00:40:46.259]  And in the immediate aftermath of his visit,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.141]  Alright, let's start shutting this down.
[00:41:08.029 --> 00:41:18.199]  There's about four minutes of this boil-down of the hour-long interview we had on Friday with a gentleman who was a CIA Section Chief of Intelligence and Analysis.
[00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:20.761]  So he ran a whole region.
[00:41:20.761 --> 00:41:23.544]  And then was the Deputy Head of Counterterrorism in the State Department.
[00:41:23.544 --> 00:41:27.708]  So that was the leading expert on terrorism in the State Department.
[00:41:27.708 --> 00:41:31.271]  Because it's always the main deputy that actually executes the operations.
[00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:32.152]  And he's a famous guy.
[00:41:34.155 --> 00:41:40.856]  Just like all the other famous guys, the former head of technical at the NSA, the guy that actually ran it.
[00:41:40.856 --> 00:41:43.497]  William Binney, who's on Tuesday.
[00:41:43.497 --> 00:41:50.318]  He's had some medical issues and couldn't come on last week when all this info came out about the NSA and the rest of it, but he's joining us tomorrow.
[00:41:50.318 --> 00:41:51.819]  Tough guy.
[00:41:51.819 --> 00:41:57.760]  He got hit with something and lost both his legs after he whistle-blew, and then they swapped him to a bunch of other stuff.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.001]  And that's why I'm not being dramatic here when I tell you we're not playing games.
[00:42:02.995 --> 00:42:06.377]  They're going to come out and say this is fake, like they always do.
[00:42:06.377 --> 00:42:09.678]  And they're going to come out and, you know, say Lord knows what else.
[00:42:09.678 --> 00:42:17.322]  I know for a fact they've got the highest levels of the Democratic Party.
[00:42:17.322 --> 00:42:20.304]  Well, I'm not going to say what they're doing at this point.
[00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:22.125]  I'm just telling you.
[00:42:22.125 --> 00:42:24.806]  There's been certain things I've done over the years that all hell breaks loose.
[00:42:24.806 --> 00:42:25.966]  This is one of them.
[00:42:25.966 --> 00:42:30.889]  Because the President knows there's a bunch of cowards out there that won't stand up for themselves, stand up for the country, or stand up for him.
[00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:36.072]  But there are people that will, and InfoWars is it.
[00:42:36.072 --> 00:42:39.055]  And so, the President knows he was spied on.
[00:42:39.055 --> 00:42:40.296]  He's the President.
[00:42:40.296 --> 00:42:41.176]  Plus, it's all public.
[00:42:41.176 --> 00:42:42.638]  They spied on the Senate, you name it.
[00:42:42.638 --> 00:42:48.182]  Well, now the database with him being spied on before he was President is out, when Obama was President.
[00:42:48.182 --> 00:42:50.304]  So, there you go.
[00:42:50.304 --> 00:42:53.127]  Powerful info on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:42:53.127 --> 00:42:57.691]  Go ahead and publish this early because of obvious security issues.
[00:42:57.691 --> 00:42:58.111]  Stay with us.
[00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:02.631]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:43:02.631 --> 00:43:08.536]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:43:08.536 --> 00:43:11.099]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:43:11.099 --> 00:43:16.904]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:43:16.904 --> 00:43:22.610]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.991]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:43:25.991 --> 00:43:31.553]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:43:31.553 --> 00:43:38.575]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[00:43:38.575 --> 00:43:43.136]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.

[00:44:00.114 --> 00:44:00.914]  Hey, everyone!
[00:44:00.914 --> 00:44:07.057]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:44:07.057 --> 00:44:09.138]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:44:09.138 --> 00:44:19.402]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:44:19.402 --> 00:44:25.385]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:44:25.865 --> 00:44:40.702]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino

[00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.091]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[00:46:05.091 --> 00:46:06.352]  David in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:46:07.361 --> 00:46:07.781]  Great!
[00:46:07.781 --> 00:46:08.901]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:46:08.901 --> 00:46:13.362]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:46:13.362 --> 00:46:22.544]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:46:22.544 --> 00:46:23.584]  Wow, thank you.
[00:46:23.584 --> 00:46:25.865]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:46:25.865 --> 00:46:27.765]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:46:27.765 --> 00:46:31.066]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[00:46:31.246 --> 00:46:31.766]  That's amazing.
[00:46:31.766 --> 00:46:32.507]  That's really incredible.
[00:46:32.507 --> 00:46:35.889]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:46:35.889 --> 00:46:36.910]  I haven't felt this week.
[00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.591]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:46:38.591 --> 00:46:39.831]  And I love you guys.
[00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:41.973]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[00:46:41.973 --> 00:46:48.837]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:46:48.837 --> 00:46:49.878]  You will love it.
[00:46:49.878 --> 00:46:52.019]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[00:46:52.019 --> 00:46:56.442]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:56.442 --> 00:46:58.283]  It's the win-win InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:04.865 --> 00:47:12.848]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:12.848 --> 00:47:27.894]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:47:27.894 --> 00:47:30.155]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:32.568 --> 00:47:39.472]  His name's Matt Rosenberg.
[00:47:39.472 --> 00:47:41.433]  He was in four articles.
[00:47:41.433 --> 00:47:42.974]  I keep saying three.
[00:47:42.974 --> 00:47:44.575]  Zach was pointing it out during the break.
[00:47:44.575 --> 00:47:46.536]  One of our great producers and researchers.
[00:47:46.536 --> 00:47:50.898]  No, it's four articles the week of the inauguration.
[00:47:50.898 --> 00:47:58.583]  The 18th, the 19th, the 20th, the 21st saying intercepts, wiretaps, communications, Trump Tower, NSA spying on Trump.
[00:47:59.483 --> 00:48:04.305]  And then he goes on CNN Thursday and says, Alex Jones is crazy.
[00:48:04.305 --> 00:48:06.806]  He made up that I said wiretaps.
[00:48:06.806 --> 00:48:10.127]  They just choose me like they think I've been discredited.
[00:48:10.127 --> 00:48:12.828]  And then say, Alex said it and Trump picked it up.
[00:48:12.828 --> 00:48:23.872]  And then we show, in the piece Friday, I guess Zach found another one, three articles where Rosenberg says that they were wiretapping Trump, that Obama was.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.600]  Now, I want to explain something.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:32.443]  I'm going to show you mainstream news articles from Reuters, AP, New York Times, Leningradian to prove this.
[00:48:32.443 --> 00:48:37.305]  I mean, I've covered this for decades, so it's old news.
[00:48:37.305 --> 00:48:42.147]  But they play this game like, oh, the whole universe starts over every five seconds.
[00:48:42.147 --> 00:48:43.648]  Like we're all goldfish and have no memory.
[00:48:43.648 --> 00:48:48.630]  Remember Gruber, the guy that helped write Obamacare, said, thank God you have no attention spans, thank God you're so dumb.
[00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:52.932]  He has such nerve, he comes out and attacks Trump for scams on the new health care bill.
[00:48:52.932 --> 00:48:54.873]  When it's not perfect, but it's a lot better than Gruber.
[00:48:56.653 --> 00:48:58.696]  So Matthew Rosenberg thinks you're an idiot.
[00:48:58.696 --> 00:48:59.477]  Here it is.
[00:48:59.477 --> 00:49:05.244]  This is Mark Mazzetti, Carl Hulse, July 31st, 2014.
[00:49:05.244 --> 00:49:08.468]  Inquiry by CIA affirms it's spied on Senate panels.
[00:49:08.468 --> 00:49:10.310]  So see, they spy illegally domestically.
[00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:11.512]  That was all admitted.
[00:49:12.426 --> 00:49:13.467]  A constitutional crisis.
[00:49:13.467 --> 00:49:14.728]  The CIA turns on the Senate.
[00:49:14.728 --> 00:49:15.809]  Leningradian.
[00:49:15.809 --> 00:49:16.470]  Exclusive.
[00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.730]  U.S.
[00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:26.040]  directs agents to cover up programs used to investigate Americans, Reuters, using NSA database given to federal and state law enforcement through threat fusion centers.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.082]  And then, what comes out?
[00:49:30.015 --> 00:49:37.558]  is the Electronic Frontier Foundation that is a pro privacy rights, probably the preeminent group even bigger than the ACLU.
[00:49:37.558 --> 00:49:38.719]  They actually do something.
[00:49:38.719 --> 00:49:44.341]  Defending your rights in the digital world and by that they'll defend right-wing, left-wing, they don't care.
[00:49:44.341 --> 00:49:49.204]  Secret mass surveillance network to spark global controversy this year.
[00:49:49.204 --> 00:49:53.485]  Yet the National Security Agency dragnet programs continually unconstitutionally monitoring Americans.
[00:49:53.485 --> 00:49:54.846]  So it goes on how it's continuing.
[00:49:54.846 --> 00:49:58.688]  Now the dragnet's admitted, dragnet's been in mainstream news.
[00:49:58.688 --> 00:49:59.208]  We've covered it.
[00:50:00.987 --> 00:50:05.471]  Law enforcement has access to the Dragnet database of who was surveilled.
[00:50:05.471 --> 00:50:08.473]  If they can go show an agency, they have pertinent reason.
[00:50:08.473 --> 00:50:15.219]  They can be selectively allowed in to the database of the National Security Agency.
[00:50:15.219 --> 00:50:21.384]  Not just the DEA, not just the FBI, not just the federal marshals, but local law enforcement.
[00:50:21.384 --> 00:50:24.467]  A large portion of it has been basically federally deputized.
[00:50:25.831 --> 00:50:30.272]  Which is, of course, I've always said a dangerous thing, but then you kind of see how that's exposing it.
[00:50:30.272 --> 00:50:34.014]  But this comes from federal sources.
[00:50:34.014 --> 00:50:44.037]  In Sheriff Arpaio's cold posse case unit that's broken so much, and Mike Zullo, who's an incredible patriot, and has all of his sources.
[00:50:44.037 --> 00:50:45.998]  But this is from the database.
[00:50:45.998 --> 00:50:47.198]  So the database is admitted.
[00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:54.042]  But no one's ever seen the database but law enforcement.
[00:50:54.042 --> 00:51:05.588]  So they want to say the president's lying about all this when it's already been in the news in four New York Times articles by one guy that goes on the news and says he never said it and we're crazy.
[00:51:05.588 --> 00:51:09.890]  And you all heard him a month and a half ago saying, we have the intercepts, they've got the wiretaps.
[00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.352]  Why, we heard Trump and we heard all these people.
[00:51:12.352 --> 00:51:13.172]  That was all lies.
[00:51:13.172 --> 00:51:16.034]  They were wiretapping, but there was nothing really there.
[00:51:16.034 --> 00:51:20.336]  As Nunes said two weeks ago, and he finally came out yesterday and said, we've looked at it all.
[00:51:20.816 --> 00:51:24.438]  There's not even phone calls till he's president-elect of the Russians.
[00:51:24.438 --> 00:51:26.699]  There's nothing.
[00:51:26.699 --> 00:51:33.041]  Then they try stuff like, well, one building he built in England had a Russian contractor.
[00:51:33.041 --> 00:51:39.944]  So they're desperate, folks, but you remember, but you don't have to remember, we can show you the headlines.
[00:51:39.944 --> 00:51:43.986]  So Zach was just saying during the break, it's crazy how dumb they think we are.
[00:51:45.441 --> 00:51:50.864]  Remember Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence of Russian election hacking and their contacts with Trump.
[00:51:50.864 --> 00:51:53.406]  That was just 18 days ago.
[00:51:53.406 --> 00:52:02.431]  So you've got the whole deep state and the corrupt bureaucracy that's bipartisan that doesn't want Trump to be right, doesn't want him to reform the system.
[00:52:02.431 --> 00:52:06.654]  And isn't it funny that Trump was all Mr. Surveillance as long as it was against Al Qaeda or something.
[00:52:06.654 --> 00:52:08.675]  He's like, no sir, they'll use it against everybody.
[00:52:08.675 --> 00:52:09.595]  Now he gets it.
[00:52:09.595 --> 00:52:11.677]  Isn't that incredible?
[00:52:11.677 --> 00:52:12.317]  Now he's learning.
[00:52:15.558 --> 00:52:25.340]  So the big news here is InfoWars.com has screenshots of it with the phone numbers cut off the back and the home addresses cut off the back.
[00:52:29.775 --> 00:52:34.019]  You see, we even have a warehouse where we ship products out of and are administrative.
[00:52:34.019 --> 00:52:36.381]  Then we have a place where I actually do the show.
[00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:42.886]  And they have the location of where I was actually doing the show until just a short time ago in the NSA database.
[00:52:42.886 --> 00:52:45.128]  And then this is like, this is the place to surveil.
[00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:46.949]  And these are the phone numbers to surveil.
[00:52:46.949 --> 00:52:49.431]  And this is the, this is where Alex Jones is really at.
[00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:51.653]  And this is where you actually target.
[00:52:51.653 --> 00:52:53.475]  This is where he's using phones.
[00:52:53.475 --> 00:52:56.998]  As if I'm running around using, you know, the secretary's phone to make some illegal phone call.
[00:52:58.257 --> 00:53:13.693]  And I remember back when I first learned about this ten years ago, that federal cases came up, so we ended up in newspapers, that in intercepts of my phone calls and my emails, people that were being indicted and stuff on separate issues, they were using phone calls and stuff from my show to indict them or arrest them.
[00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:19.005]  Just like we learned with Roger Stones was under, actually got a FISA court on him.
[00:53:19.005 --> 00:53:21.627]  Hell, they were all over the news saying he's a Russian agent.
[00:53:21.627 --> 00:53:23.388]  Surveil him, target Trump.
[00:53:23.388 --> 00:53:27.772]  We need the DOJ to investigate Trump as a Russian spy just three months ago in the campaign.
[00:53:27.772 --> 00:53:29.534]  Remember that?
[00:53:29.534 --> 00:53:30.354]  And then they were.
[00:53:30.354 --> 00:53:32.797]  Then they tell you they never were.
[00:53:32.797 --> 00:53:36.660]  It shows how dumb they are that they think you're that stupid.
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.682]  That's why Trump's approval ratings go up, theirs go down.
[00:53:39.872 --> 00:53:44.956]  But after all these years of surveillance, they don't have anything that I ever did wrong, because I'm pretty boring, folks.
[00:53:44.956 --> 00:53:51.622]  I never get sick of barbecue, and swimming in the swimming pool, or going hog hunting like I did with my son and some folks yesterday.
[00:53:51.622 --> 00:53:56.385]  I just... I just never get sick of the same old stuff.
[00:53:56.385 --> 00:53:59.288]  I'm just a regular guy, other than the fact that I'm not going to be a slave of the New World Order.
[00:54:01.257 --> 00:54:12.081]  So coming up, we've got Dr. Corsi on first, who broke this through Sheriff Arpaio and the detectives, outgoing sheriff, now gone sheriff of Maricopa County.
[00:54:12.081 --> 00:54:19.443]  We got all this other incredible news, but I know, I see these comments on InfoWars.
[00:54:19.443 --> 00:54:25.765]  And I see the reports.
[00:54:25.765 --> 00:54:30.087]  And it's just, it's just mind-blowing.
[00:54:32.059 --> 00:54:36.184]  That they think you're so stupid that they can deny they've engaged in all this illegal surveillance.
[00:54:36.184 --> 00:54:37.605]  I have several clips I want to play.
[00:54:37.605 --> 00:54:40.208]  Before we do that, the crew's pointing this out.
[00:54:40.208 --> 00:54:45.615]  InfoWars got knocked off of Google Ads through AdRoll, their subsidiary company they work with.
[00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:50.220]  And they said, because you criticize Obama and the Democrats and the UN and climate change, you're not real.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:50.821]  We're banning you.
[00:54:52.841 --> 00:54:54.002]  They said the President isn't real.
[00:54:54.002 --> 00:54:54.742]  We're trying to ban him.
[00:54:54.742 --> 00:54:56.423]  They said he's not legitimate.
[00:54:56.423 --> 00:55:03.867]  And so they took that ad program, strangely enough, was just about all the extra money we had to budget for expansion in 2017.
[00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:06.109]  It was $3.3 million.
[00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:08.070]  We've been doing it three years.
[00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:08.890]  It was very successful.
[00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:11.752]  It was going to be $5 million or more this year.
[00:55:11.752 --> 00:55:12.993]  But that sounds like a lot of money.
[00:55:12.993 --> 00:55:18.696]  When you've got 60-something employees and bandwidth and expenses and legal, let me tell you something, that's not a lot of money.
[00:55:19.514 --> 00:55:21.956]  We have a lot of other ways to fund ourselves, but that was just getting us there.
[00:55:21.956 --> 00:55:29.241]  And it's funny, what they blew away, all these leftist groups boycotting us and saying go after our sponsors.
[00:55:29.241 --> 00:55:31.522]  What they blew away was the extra money.
[00:55:31.522 --> 00:55:34.905]  So now we're in a position of not even having the money to go forward.
[00:55:37.028 --> 00:55:39.869]  And then they're hitting us with other stuff behind the scenes because they know we're hurting them.
[00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:40.729]  They know we're real.
[00:55:40.729 --> 00:55:41.809]  They know we'll tell the truth.
[00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:42.850]  They know we're fearless.
[00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:43.830]  They know we want justice.
[00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:44.850]  They know we're not stopping.
[00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:50.492]  They know we're Americans, bitter clingers, who want unity and prosperity and freedom in this country.
[00:55:50.492 --> 00:55:51.832]  The globalists don't want that.
[00:55:51.832 --> 00:55:53.472]  Their own WikiLeaks show that.
[00:55:53.472 --> 00:55:54.713]  They want total monopoly of power.
[00:55:54.713 --> 00:55:55.593]  That's called dictatorship.
[00:55:57.281 --> 00:56:02.227]  So, we sell water filters everybody needs because of the toxins, the glyphosates, the garbage, the water.
[00:56:02.227 --> 00:56:04.149]  Filter your water, at least for your kids.
[00:56:04.149 --> 00:56:05.471]  We have the best shower filters.
[00:56:05.471 --> 00:56:06.833]  We have the best bath filters.
[00:56:06.833 --> 00:56:09.095]  That's where your kids really absorb it, the skin on their lungs.

[00:56:34.368 --> 00:56:38.610]  We also have the Nanotech systems by another great American-made company.
[00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:42.312]  But Defender, same price as Defender, sells it.
[00:56:42.312 --> 00:56:43.513]  Nobody else gets this deal.
[00:56:43.513 --> 00:56:44.693]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:44.693 --> 00:56:45.354]  No reviews yet.
[00:56:46.442 --> 00:56:48.824]  We just started selling it Friday, but this is something everybody needs.
[00:56:48.824 --> 00:56:50.605]  And who knows, they throw Trump out or take over.
[00:56:50.605 --> 00:56:56.930]  Kydex holsters are the best NSR technical systems.
[00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:57.431]  We've got it.

[00:57:17.413 --> 00:57:24.537]  Todd in an undisclosed location from Power Review says, wow, more energy workouts and great feel stronger and my girlfriend is enjoying it too.
[00:57:24.537 --> 00:57:25.758]  That's the first thing I noticed.
[00:57:25.758 --> 00:57:27.099]  This is definitely a
[00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:28.440]  Repurchase.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:31.262]  Thank you, Todd, for the purchase and the review.
[00:57:31.262 --> 00:57:33.504]  Incredible, says the other reviewers.
[00:57:33.504 --> 00:57:33.985]  Yeah.

[00:57:36.507 --> 00:57:38.248]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:38.248 --> 00:57:43.013]  And whatever you do, spread the article, spread the links, spread the videos, because they're trying to block us on Google.
[00:57:43.013 --> 00:57:46.256]  Not just with being able to sponsor, but being able to share our links.
[00:57:46.256 --> 00:57:48.057]  Facebook, Twitter's ratcheting us down.
[00:57:48.057 --> 00:57:50.079]  They first strangle you before they shut you down.
[00:57:50.079 --> 00:57:50.720]  We're under attack.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.281]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:57:52.481 --> 00:57:59.085]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:57:59.085 --> 00:58:02.247]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:02.247 --> 00:58:12.034]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:58:12.034 --> 00:58:12.874]  Caveman.
[00:58:12.874 --> 00:58:17.938]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:58:17.938 --> 00:58:20.059]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:58:20.339 --> 00:58:23.500]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:28.640]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:36.782]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:58:36.782 --> 00:58:44.543]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:58:44.543 --> 00:58:49.364]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.

[00:59:54.454 --> 00:59:57.098]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.807 --> 01:00:13.570]  We are on the march.
[01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:16.734]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:16.734 --> 01:00:20.438]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:33.513]  All right, I want to play this clip before we go to the next segment and come in with the actual breakdown on the NSA spying on Donald Trump, now confirmed by Barack Obama, exclusively at Infowars.com.
[01:00:33.513 --> 01:00:36.353]  Tim Allen on Trump, surveillance and Hollywood leftist.
[01:00:36.353 --> 01:00:37.673]  I don't like a lot of TV shows.
[01:00:37.673 --> 01:00:39.294]  I loved his show back when it was on.
[01:00:39.294 --> 01:00:41.134]  His other shows are hits.
[01:00:41.134 --> 01:00:42.614]  He's a top comic.
[01:00:42.614 --> 01:00:43.795]  And he's just a common sense guy.
[01:00:43.795 --> 01:00:45.215]  He's not left or right.
[01:00:45.215 --> 01:00:49.996]  And he went on to break all this down on Jimmy Kimmel's show.
[01:00:49.996 --> 01:00:51.896]  So let's analyze part of this piece right now.
[01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.651]  You went to the presidential inauguration, right?
[01:00:54.651 --> 01:01:01.857]  I was invited by, we did a VIP thing for the vets and went to the veterans ball and so I went to go see the Democrats and Republicans.
[01:01:01.857 --> 01:01:03.017]  Yeah, I went to the inauguration.
[01:01:03.017 --> 01:01:04.679]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not attacking you!
[01:01:04.679 --> 01:01:07.421]  You get in this town, I'm not kidding.
[01:01:07.421 --> 01:01:10.103]  You gotta be real careful around here, you know, you get beat up.
[01:01:10.103 --> 01:01:13.845]  If you don't believe what everybody believes, this is like 30s Germany.
[01:01:13.845 --> 01:01:16.167]  I don't know what, I don't know what happened.
[01:01:16.167 --> 01:01:21.351]  If you're not part of the group, you know what we believe is right, they go, well I might have a problem
[01:01:22.501 --> 01:01:23.381]  I'm a comedian.
[01:01:23.381 --> 01:01:26.463]  I like going on both sides.
[01:01:26.463 --> 01:01:28.824]  This government does stuff big.
[01:01:28.824 --> 01:01:30.264]  I've never been to anything like that.
[01:01:30.264 --> 01:01:31.325]  Was it a big deal?
[01:01:31.325 --> 01:01:32.305]  I mean, just so many people.
[01:01:32.305 --> 01:01:39.168]  And when they show up, you know, the ex-president gets in a helicopter and there's jets and marines taking him this way and there's parades.
[01:01:39.168 --> 01:01:40.688]  But it looks like a Cadillac parade.
[01:01:40.688 --> 01:01:42.849]  Everything was just rows of Cadillacs.
[01:01:42.849 --> 01:01:45.190]  And my kids were going, is this the parade?
[01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:47.911]  It's like black Cadillac after black Cadillac and then a tractor.
[01:01:47.911 --> 01:01:50.993]  I don't know what was... There's no, like, marching bands.
[01:01:50.993 --> 01:01:51.653]  There's nothing...
[01:01:52.173 --> 01:01:52.854]  I like parades.
[01:01:52.854 --> 01:01:54.876]  I used to like parades, which is a funny off story.
[01:01:54.876 --> 01:01:56.657]  I took my little ones.
[01:01:56.657 --> 01:01:59.119]  I'm not ignorant, but sometimes I play it.
[01:01:59.119 --> 01:02:03.363]  We went to see the Santa Monica parade down on Santa Monica Boulevard.
[01:02:03.363 --> 01:02:03.523]  Okay.
[01:02:03.523 --> 01:02:04.584]  The gay parade.
[01:02:04.584 --> 01:02:04.865]  Oh, okay.
[01:02:04.865 --> 01:02:08.408]  I thought when it went to gay, there would be floats and stuff.
[01:02:08.408 --> 01:02:10.430]  You don't want to take a five-year-old to that parade.
[01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:13.152]  You don't want to... He's not bashing.
[01:02:13.152 --> 01:02:13.893]  Look at the music.
[01:02:13.893 --> 01:02:15.514]  It's like, why is it a bunch of naked men?
[01:02:15.514 --> 01:02:16.015]  What the hell?
[01:02:18.797 --> 01:02:20.197]  There's no bullwinkle.
[01:02:20.197 --> 01:02:22.058]  No other parade does that.
[01:02:22.058 --> 01:02:24.519]  Pride parades have a different tone.
[01:02:24.519 --> 01:02:27.640]  Broad daylight, a bunch of naked men.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.401]  What other parade does that?
[01:02:28.401 --> 01:02:31.322]  I don't care if you're gay, but why do you do this?
[01:02:31.322 --> 01:02:32.682]  Dominating everybody.
[01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:36.704]  So you're talking about, you know, well you do stand-up, you go around.
[01:02:36.704 --> 01:02:37.504]  You tell he's pissed.
[01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:38.385]  I've never seen this.
[01:02:39.205 --> 01:02:43.928]  I have buddies that are in the security business.
[01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:46.950]  I'm a tech freak, so I have a guy that's got no... This is so good.
[01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:48.210]  He says, what's Google doing?
[01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.291]  Who are these people?
[01:02:50.291 --> 01:02:51.352]  He tells me this weird story.
[01:02:51.352 --> 01:02:53.693]  He says, you put an iPhone down for a week, you shut it off.
[01:02:53.693 --> 01:02:54.734]  In a week, it's dead, right?
[01:02:54.734 --> 01:02:57.175]  And I go, oh God, it's not really ever off.
[01:02:57.175 --> 01:02:58.256]  He goes, no, it's never off.
[01:02:58.256 --> 01:02:59.176]  They always know where you are.
[01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:00.637]  And I go, oh God.
[01:03:00.637 --> 01:03:03.279]  I get paranoid just from being around this cat.
[01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.380]  But one day I was thinking, if a government
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.222]  Drove by down the street with like a grey sedan with a camera on it.
[01:03:09.222 --> 01:03:11.202]  You'd be rioting going to Washington.
[01:03:11.202 --> 01:03:14.584]  But if it's white, with emojis and Google on it, yay!
[01:03:14.584 --> 01:03:16.525]  You're waving at it!
[01:03:16.525 --> 01:03:22.307]  They're taking pictures of your house!
[01:03:22.307 --> 01:03:24.088]  You're waving at it!
[01:03:24.088 --> 01:03:28.210]  Take a picture of my house from the sky!
[01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:30.731]  There's that camera that looks around your block.
[01:03:30.731 --> 01:03:32.972]  Who are these people?
[01:03:32.972 --> 01:03:33.992]  I wanted to put F.U.
[01:03:33.992 --> 01:03:34.953]  on the top of my house.
[01:03:36.525 --> 01:03:38.130]  I'm out there going like this.
[01:03:46.474 --> 01:03:48.815]  I did it too, and I was like, hey, there's my car!
[01:03:48.815 --> 01:03:51.815]  I know, it's a little spooky.
[01:03:51.815 --> 01:03:53.456]  Our privacy, you give up.
[01:03:53.456 --> 01:03:56.757]  You go, and I like Amazon Prime as much as anybody.
[01:03:56.757 --> 01:03:57.617]  You shop for a lot.
[01:03:57.617 --> 01:04:00.717]  I wish people would shop for the news as much as we shop for a new pair of glasses.
[01:04:00.717 --> 01:04:02.478]  I mean, you gotta look for stuff.
[01:04:02.478 --> 01:04:06.479]  But Amazon, at the bottom, they suggest things you might like.
[01:04:07.119 --> 01:04:11.040]  You mean like the stuff I just bought yesterday?
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.980]  Why do they know way too much about us?
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:17.681]  I feel sometimes they send things to my home that I never order.
[01:04:17.681 --> 01:04:19.061]  Just to see if you'd like it.
[01:04:19.061 --> 01:04:20.322]  And I always like it.
[01:04:20.322 --> 01:04:21.402]  It's a weird thing.
[01:04:21.402 --> 01:04:24.162]  It's like some automatic thing that's going on.
[01:04:24.162 --> 01:04:28.683]  This was a relational database, and I believe it was the University of Wisconsin about 19 years ago.
[01:04:28.683 --> 01:04:30.524]  They started this whole thing.
[01:04:30.524 --> 01:04:32.584]  They'd give you 10 of your favorite movies.
[01:04:33.044 --> 01:04:34.965]  And you go, yeah, I like these five.
[01:04:34.965 --> 01:04:36.026]  At what degree do you like them?
[01:04:36.026 --> 01:04:39.749]  They compare to another five, then you give it 20 more, and then 30, then you get down to 10.
[01:04:39.749 --> 01:04:45.053]  At the end of that, about 30 minutes of this, they'll give you five films that you'd love, and I loved every one of them.
[01:04:45.053 --> 01:04:45.273]  Really?
[01:04:45.273 --> 01:04:46.654]  They sold that to Harrods.
[01:04:46.654 --> 01:04:49.256]  That is now the relational database they use on all of us.
[01:04:49.256 --> 01:04:50.416]  On Netflix and whatever?
[01:04:50.416 --> 01:04:51.037]  Everywhere.
[01:04:51.037 --> 01:04:53.639]  Once they know your preferences... You know what's funny?
[01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:56.581]  Sometimes I get on my Netflix queue, and it says what I might like.
[01:04:56.581 --> 01:04:59.203]  I've never seen somebody dish so much knowledge in five minutes.
[01:04:59.203 --> 01:05:00.524]  This guy is so on target.
[01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:03.508]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:05:03.508 --> 01:05:10.112]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:05:10.112 --> 01:05:13.273]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:13.273 --> 01:05:23.059]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:05:23.059 --> 01:05:23.899]  Caveman.
[01:05:23.899 --> 01:05:28.962]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:05:28.962 --> 01:05:31.083]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:05:31.363 --> 01:05:34.524]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:05:34.524 --> 01:05:39.665]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:05:39.665 --> 01:05:47.808]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:05:47.808 --> 01:05:55.650]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:05:55.650 --> 01:06:00.411]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLive.com today.
[01:06:02.617 --> 01:06:05.118]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:06:05.118 --> 01:06:10.599]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:16.621]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[01:06:16.621 --> 01:06:19.542]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:23.923]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[01:06:23.923 --> 01:06:26.324]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[01:06:26.324 --> 01:06:30.465]  I'm a rebel by morning.
[01:06:31.929 --> 01:06:34.054]  Amarillo's on my mind.
[01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:41.414]  We are back live.
[01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:45.176]  Thank you so much for joining us in this second hour of the Sunday broadcast.
[01:06:45.176 --> 01:06:52.121]  We're joined by investigative journalist, three times number one New York Times bestselling author, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:06:52.121 --> 01:06:56.584]  Credited with winning one election for the Republicans and helping win three others.
[01:06:56.584 --> 01:07:01.607]  And of course he formerly worked with the State Department and other areas and of course has several degrees.
[01:07:01.607 --> 01:07:04.289]  One from Harvard dealing with international banking and finance.
[01:07:04.989 --> 01:07:07.590]  He's an expert on so many fronts.
[01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:14.933]  He's published an article today that I wanted to wait till tomorrow to put out because I wanted to add some of the other breaking news to it.
[01:07:14.933 --> 01:07:20.855]  But Merkel Thelen, as we speak, is adding some of the other backup documentation.
[01:07:20.855 --> 01:07:21.755]  I mean, this is proven.
[01:07:21.755 --> 01:07:23.316]  This is extremely credible.
[01:07:24.676 --> 01:07:25.517]  Everybody forgets.
[01:07:25.517 --> 01:07:31.341]  They admit that the DEA, the FBI has accessed the NSA database and is spying on Americans domestically.
[01:07:31.341 --> 01:07:32.962]  They've had congressional hearings.
[01:07:32.962 --> 01:07:35.104]  It's been in hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[01:07:35.104 --> 01:07:43.049]  But I wanted to remind the public that this parallel construction is going on where they use the NSA spy systems to look at Americans.
[01:07:43.049 --> 01:07:51.576]  Then they go and formulate investigations after they have the data from the NSA and go to the courts claiming other evidence, many times fake, to be able to then get the indictments.
[01:07:52.506 --> 01:08:01.035]  So if you want to pull that up, just type in parallel construction and you'll get Reuters, Associated Press, you name it, dealing with it.
[01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:02.416]  But here's some of the headlines.
[01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:07.262]  Dragnet NSA spying survives 2015 review.
[01:08:07.262 --> 01:08:14.829]  And that is a giant illegal domestic spy grid, Electronic Frontier Foundation, going on for at least a decade plus.
[01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:17.235]  So, several years of George W. Bush.
[01:08:17.235 --> 01:08:18.678]  There it is in Reuters.
[01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:19.019]  U.S.
[01:08:19.019 --> 01:08:22.608]  directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans illegally.
[01:08:22.608 --> 01:08:23.670]  That's Reuters.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.861]  NSA files decoded.
[01:08:25.861 --> 01:08:26.522]  London Guardian.
[01:08:26.522 --> 01:08:28.063]  Edward Stone surveillance.
[01:08:28.063 --> 01:08:29.765]  Revelations explained.
[01:08:29.765 --> 01:08:33.628]  Confirmed by public documents and congressional inquiries.
[01:08:33.628 --> 01:08:35.670]  Again, the Senate spied on.
[01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:37.031]  Just on budgetary.
[01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:38.573]  What are they planning to do with the CIA?
[01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:39.754]  The CIA spied on them.
[01:08:39.754 --> 01:08:43.798]  Not as Chinese spies or anything else, but what are they going to do with our budget?
[01:08:43.798 --> 01:08:45.059]  So, illegally doing that.
[01:08:45.059 --> 01:08:47.781]  That's the New York Times.
[01:08:47.781 --> 01:08:49.863]  Here's another one.
[01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:50.644]  Dealing with all of this.
[01:08:52.356 --> 01:08:52.476]  U.S.
[01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:54.537]  directs agents to cover up program.
[01:08:54.537 --> 01:08:57.118]  So it's all right there.
[01:08:57.118 --> 01:09:05.182]  Now, we know that Dragnet exists, did exist, and Electronic Frontier Foundation says at least up to 2016 it's still ongoing.
[01:09:05.182 --> 01:09:09.484]  That's a very respective nonpartisan group.
[01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:12.965]  But now, we have our law enforcement sources.
[01:09:12.965 --> 01:09:18.108]  I'm going to be very careful about this because I don't just do this as a matter of protecting myself.
[01:09:19.068 --> 01:09:30.558]  I have law enforcement sources and others, and then I have investigative journalists who have long histories of doing this for decades, like Corsi, who now works for InfoWars, setting up her Washington Bureau, who know how to do it legally and lawfully.
[01:09:30.558 --> 01:09:40.107]  Because let me tell you, I've talked to lawyers, I've talked to others, when I got secret FBI manuals and other things, and I had family that had been in intelligence agencies say, you're lucky you're alive, man.
[01:09:41.018 --> 01:09:47.120]  You know, the stuff about veterans are the number one enemy, there's a national gun confiscation plan, all that stuff nobody believed for a week when we broke it.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:10:00.964]  The MIAC report, remember the veterans are the terrorists, and then Napolitano, Janet Napolitano, the bad Napolitano, not Judge Napolitano, came out and said, oh yes, we are saying that veterans are the number one enemy.
[01:10:00.964 --> 01:10:02.145]  That's a real manual.
[01:10:02.145 --> 01:10:03.765]  Well, this is bigger than that, okay?
[01:10:03.765 --> 01:10:05.166]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:15.933]  NSA database documents NSA electronic surveillance of Donald Trump in Trump Tower in Alex Jones in Texas.
[01:10:15.933 --> 01:10:18.857]  And it goes through it and has screenshots of the real documents.
[01:10:20.063 --> 01:10:25.628]  But the phone numbers are X'd out, and that's done in the database until you get authorization to get into it.
[01:10:25.628 --> 01:10:28.070]  You have to have secret clearance to get into it.
[01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:34.535]  But when state police and federal law enforcement want it, they've got to get authorization from special boards that are very shadowy to get into it.
[01:10:34.535 --> 01:10:35.456]  Then it unlocks it all.
[01:10:35.456 --> 01:10:36.797]  But I know these phone numbers.
[01:10:36.797 --> 01:10:37.458]  I've called Trump.
[01:10:37.458 --> 01:10:39.440]  He's called me on these numbers.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:39.940]  It's all right here.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:40.881]  Of course, Trump's the president.
[01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:43.763]  He knows way more than this when he says he knows he's been surveilled.
[01:10:43.763 --> 01:10:46.386]  Well, it turns out he's been surveilled by Obama and even before.
[01:10:46.926 --> 01:10:48.407]  So this is huge.
[01:10:48.407 --> 01:10:51.009]  It's on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:10:51.009 --> 01:10:54.131]  We're updating the article and adding new documentation as it goes.
[01:10:54.131 --> 01:10:56.332]  So if you've already been looking at it, hit refresh.
[01:10:56.332 --> 01:10:57.233]  Let's go to Dr. Corsi.
[01:10:57.233 --> 01:10:58.434]  We've got five minutes till break.
[01:10:58.434 --> 01:10:59.374]  We'll come back.
[01:10:59.374 --> 01:11:04.238]  We have the detective with the cold case posse with the outgoing sheriff in Maricopa County.
[01:11:04.238 --> 01:11:08.300]  Sheriff Arpaio has been bravely involved in all this as well.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:11.723]  So give us a boil down of how big this is, Dr. Corsi.
[01:11:11.723 --> 01:11:14.625]  Well, this is a tremendous find.
[01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:14.825]  I mean,
[01:11:15.794 --> 01:11:22.957]  Mike Zulu and Sheriff Arpaio had project database records they got from a whistleblower.
[01:11:22.957 --> 01:11:23.978]  They've been proving them out.
[01:11:23.978 --> 01:11:24.778]  They've had them since 2013.
[01:11:24.778 --> 01:11:35.222]  Now, it was really over the past week when I started talking with Mike Zulu and we found, we realized that Donald Trump was in this database.
[01:11:35.222 --> 01:11:40.325]  He searched for it and we're posting it on InfoWars right now.
[01:11:40.325 --> 01:11:43.386]  Donald Trump has been in wiretaps, electronic surveillance,
[01:11:44.225 --> 01:11:45.927]  Uh, all over the place.
[01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:55.216]  Uh, certainly Trump Tower, but also Mar-a-Lago, various companies that he's owned, golf courses, uh, since 2004.
[01:11:57.449 --> 01:12:03.614]  Continuing into 2009, when Obama came into office, and we have no reason to believe it quit.
[01:12:03.614 --> 01:12:16.745]  Now, you know, you can't read them, but they come out as these huge pages of logs and logs and logs that show the names of the businesses, the addresses, the phone numbers that were harvested.
[01:12:16.745 --> 01:12:19.848]  And to protect the innocent, we're only releasing very limited amounts.
[01:12:20.572 --> 01:12:28.359]  Right, we're really going to try to be very careful what we're going to release on this because we're not printing the actual documents.
[01:12:28.359 --> 01:12:38.389]  There's probably a million records, a million peoples under electronic surveillance in this one database that was handed over to law enforcement in Sheriff Arpaio's office.
[01:12:39.279 --> 01:12:50.827]  And what it shows is that everybody associated with Trump, in other words, once the NSA picked up Trump, anyone Trump called was then picked up as well.
[01:12:50.827 --> 01:12:55.770]  So you've got a whole list of his employees here, and we're listing the employees.
[01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:59.912]  I think we'll want to make sure we don't include the phone numbers.
[01:12:59.912 --> 01:13:02.914]  That was in some of the original records, but I've redacted everything.
[01:13:02.914 --> 01:13:05.336]  Phone numbers aren't there, so you could call them.
[01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:12.782]  But project managers, the Trump Organization, people running his golf courses.
[01:13:12.782 --> 01:13:16.486]  And by the way, you called me last week with the sources and said, yeah, is this your cell?
[01:13:16.486 --> 01:13:17.647]  Yeah, that's my old cell.
[01:13:17.647 --> 01:13:20.429]  Yeah, this is your private office.
[01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:22.972]  People always come to the warehouse and then, yeah, there it is.
[01:13:22.972 --> 01:13:24.573]  I've moved out of their office too.
[01:13:24.573 --> 01:13:25.774]  This is wild.
[01:13:25.774 --> 01:13:28.797]  So again, let's talk about the sourcing of this.
[01:13:28.797 --> 01:13:29.598]  This is big.
[01:13:29.598 --> 01:13:30.739]  I mean, this is huge.
[01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:31.440]  This is proving
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:39.999]  That, oh yeah, this is just the database we had a hold of that Obama, when he was in office, was involved in the surveillance of President Trump before he was president.
[01:13:41.021 --> 01:13:43.103]  Yes, and also through the time he was president.
[01:13:43.103 --> 01:13:50.508]  Obama was continuing the wiretapping and this Operation Dragnet, and I think he continued it through his entire administration.
[01:13:50.508 --> 01:14:03.499]  The point of all this is that, you know, this is again documentation that Trump was under electronic surveillance in a much more massive way than I think Trump even realizes.
[01:14:03.499 --> 01:14:10.164]  I mean, all of his Trump Palace was, they were actually, these records show that Ivana Trump
[01:14:10.724 --> 01:14:13.466]  Was under surveillance.
[01:14:13.466 --> 01:14:17.229]  Fred Trump, which seems to me to be the father, under surveillance.
[01:14:17.229 --> 01:14:19.731]  They have employees of Trump.
[01:14:19.731 --> 01:14:30.520]  So it's a massive dragnet of pulling in and it was not only the phone messages, but then they did electronic surveillance of all the financial records.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.081]  They went and got bank records.
[01:14:32.561 --> 01:14:43.141]  They had credit card transaction records, tax records, and it was all compiled into massive databases on Trump going back to 2004, and I think continuing until today.
[01:14:44.793 --> 01:14:59.416]  By the way, it's incontrovertible, that's what I'm having added to the article that the New York Times said in four different articles in January that they were surveilling Trump, that they had the wiretaps, the NSA intercepts, and so we have all these other admissions of the Senate being spied on, you name it.
[01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:11.498]  So the claim that Trump's discredited and that none of this happened and that agencies say it didn't happen, well I mean, we famously have Clapper in front of the Congressional Committee saying that the NSA spies on no one in the U.S.
[01:15:11.498 --> 01:15:12.578]  when it's completely admitted they are.
[01:15:13.929 --> 01:15:20.651]  I mean, as I say, we're not going to release the list, but there's a million names on these lists.
[01:15:20.651 --> 01:15:27.313]  And what these lists show is the name of the person, the file number, the business, the address.
[01:15:27.313 --> 01:15:28.193]  And the file's key.
[01:15:28.193 --> 01:15:30.994]  This is a database of who you want to go in and hear the files.
[01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:33.175]  So this is a database to index, like a library.
[01:15:33.175 --> 01:15:35.976]  Go in and you want to hear them, track their whole history, there it is.
[01:15:36.756 --> 01:15:44.158]  And the phone numbers, all the phone numbers, and law enforcement, Mike Zullo and Sheriff Arpaio have been checking this out for a long time.
[01:15:44.158 --> 01:15:46.158]  The phone numbers all check.
[01:15:46.158 --> 01:15:52.239]  You saw your own record in this database, Alex, and proved out that that was all authentic information.
[01:15:52.239 --> 01:15:57.381]  It's got a phone number nobody even knew, and it's got an address I used to secretly broadcast out of.
[01:15:57.381 --> 01:15:58.081]  We'll be back.
[01:15:58.081 --> 01:15:58.841]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:16:01.564 --> 01:16:07.048]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:16:07.048 --> 01:16:07.888]  I take this.
[01:16:07.888 --> 01:16:09.009]  My family takes this.
[01:16:09.009 --> 01:16:13.292]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:16:13.292 --> 01:16:17.515]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:16:17.895 --> 01:16:22.537]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:16:22.537 --> 01:16:23.678]  I don't feel good.
[01:16:23.678 --> 01:16:27.420]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:30.121]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:16:30.121 --> 01:16:35.924]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:38.885]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:16:38.885 --> 01:16:42.407]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:16:42.407 --> 01:16:44.648]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:16:44.648 --> 01:16:45.008]  I love it.
[01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:47.971]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:48.992]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:16:48.992 --> 01:16:54.638]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:16:54.638 --> 01:16:56.820]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.023]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:08.395]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:17:08.395 --> 01:17:21.608]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:17:22.529 --> 01:17:34.441]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:40.406]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:17:41.147 --> 01:17:50.155]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:17:50.155 --> 01:17:58.363]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:18:01.368 --> 01:18:03.250]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:05.291]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:18:05.291 --> 01:18:08.194]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:18:08.194 --> 01:18:14.258]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:18:14.258 --> 01:18:23.446]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:18:23.446 --> 01:18:28.310]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:30.973]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:39.002]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:18:39.002 --> 01:18:39.964]  The general public doesn't.
[01:18:41.173 --> 01:18:44.555]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:18:44.555 --> 01:18:48.697]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:18:48.697 --> 01:18:55.400]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.502]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.751]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:19:03.751 --> 01:19:09.014]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:19:09.014 --> 01:19:12.195]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:19:12.195 --> 01:19:18.018]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:19:18.018 --> 01:19:26.723]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:19:27.103 --> 01:19:32.669]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:39.695]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:19:39.695 --> 01:19:44.260]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.821]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:19:47.821 --> 01:19:49.902]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:19:49.902 --> 01:19:55.623]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:19:55.623 --> 01:19:58.064]  Check it out at PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:19:58.064 --> 01:20:04.946]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:20:04.946 --> 01:20:07.607]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:12.322 --> 01:20:18.328]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[01:20:18.328 --> 01:20:22.852]  Government is the problem.
[01:20:22.852 --> 01:20:30.559]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:37.706]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[01:20:38.621 --> 01:20:40.744]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:40.744 --> 01:20:42.706]  Because there is a war on.
[01:20:42.706 --> 01:20:45.109]  For your mind.
[01:20:45.109 --> 01:20:46.290]  Hello, me.
[01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:48.673]  Meet the real me.
[01:20:48.673 --> 01:20:52.898]  Alright, uh, due to some of those things going on with security issues, this is a big deal.
[01:20:52.898 --> 01:20:54.480]  We started publishing this today.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.921]  There's more reports coming out in the next week.
[01:20:57.230 --> 01:20:59.831]  I've been talking to Dr. Corsi about what he thinks is best.
[01:20:59.831 --> 01:21:05.132]  We have done boil-downs of what's in these documents and posted them.
[01:21:05.132 --> 01:21:11.753]  I think we should black out just a marker, the contact info for people, and go ahead so everybody can see.
[01:21:11.753 --> 01:21:14.734]  And I think you can just use a computer program, obviously, or my crew can do it.
[01:21:14.734 --> 01:21:22.136]  Dr. Corsi, you know, now that you're part of InfoWars, if you want us to just black out in a whole column the phone numbers, I think we should do like Wicked Leaks does.
[01:21:22.136 --> 01:21:22.836]  They release it all.
[01:21:23.916 --> 01:21:29.118]  I think we should release with the contact info redacted, everybody's name, so folks know they were being spied on.
[01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:31.459]  Because again, this comes from law enforcement sources.
[01:21:31.459 --> 01:21:36.180]  Now we know the DEA, state police, these threat fusion centers have access to this dragnet.
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:38.501]  We know that this is going on.
[01:21:38.501 --> 01:21:39.721]  It's been in the news.
[01:21:39.721 --> 01:21:44.063]  And we know that Cheryl Atkinson of CBS on Fashion Furious got surveilled by Obama.
[01:21:44.063 --> 01:21:45.463]  She confirmed that.
[01:21:45.463 --> 01:21:48.144]  So the claim this isn't going on is like saying the sun didn't come up.
[01:21:49.025 --> 01:21:54.210]  This morning, but they'll either ignore this giant bombshell story or say it's made up.
[01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:57.753]  So we've got the detective coming on to talk about this in the next segment.
[01:21:57.753 --> 01:21:59.074]  You'll ride shotgun with us.
[01:21:59.074 --> 01:22:08.283]  But I mean, I always err on the side of safety and privacy, but at the same time,
[01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:15.158]  Maybe if the media challenges us and says it isn't real, then you can't trust MSM though.
[01:22:15.158 --> 01:22:17.200]  You send them the database, they'll put it out.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.421]  You know, we've run into this before.
[01:22:18.421 --> 01:22:21.524]  I don't know what to do, because obviously they're going to say this isn't real.
[01:22:21.524 --> 01:22:29.092]  Just like, you know, we said Obamacare had death panels, or got rid of your doctor, or doubled prices, and Gruber said, thank God they're dumb, you know.
[01:22:29.092 --> 01:22:29.833]  We just denied it.
[01:22:29.833 --> 01:22:31.174]  I mean, we know this is real.
[01:22:31.775 --> 01:22:32.836]  We know this is happening.
[01:22:32.836 --> 01:22:34.377]  I mean, this is a big deal, though.
[01:22:34.377 --> 01:22:45.727]  This is one of the biggest stories in the last year, that they've made this big deal, saying Trump's wrong, nobody surveilled him, and they're in the news months ago saying they were surveilling him, but there's nothing in the surveillance, so now they've backed off of it.
[01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:49.510]  The intelligence house head, Nunes, says there's nothing there.
[01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:51.051]  He was surveilled, but there's nothing there.
[01:22:51.972 --> 01:23:00.643]  It's just crazy that they would try to deny in this age of Snowden that surveillance is going on and that he's the president he knows he was.
[01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:03.326]  If we're getting these documentation, imagine what he's getting.
[01:23:03.326 --> 01:23:06.631]  I guess that's why he's so confident because he said in the next
[01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:09.757]  A week or so, a few days ago, this would come out.
[01:23:09.757 --> 01:23:14.221]  I guess, I wonder how it's coming out here, Dr. Carsing.
[01:23:14.221 --> 01:23:16.063]  Alex, that's exactly how it's coming out.
[01:23:16.063 --> 01:23:22.289]  On Tuesday last week, when I had the information, I shared it with the White House.
[01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:27.954]  President Trump has known about this database and that we were going to break this story since Tuesday.
[01:23:27.954 --> 01:23:30.156]  Also... By the way, let me stop you.
[01:23:30.156 --> 01:23:32.078]  I didn't know if you were ready to release that now.
[01:23:32.078 --> 01:23:32.899]  Of course, I knew that.
[01:23:33.855 --> 01:23:39.877]  I don't want to say who you're in contact with because they'll try to purge him, but I mean we're in contact with a lot of folks at the top.
[01:23:39.877 --> 01:23:42.918]  Take your time here, Dr. Corsi, even in the next segment.
[01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:47.839]  Let's walk through here the fact that they'll say, oh, they got it from InfoWars.
[01:23:47.839 --> 01:23:51.120]  No, we got it from law enforcement, just like WikiLeaks.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.241]  WikiLeaks has this too now.
[01:23:53.241 --> 01:23:54.521]  So just explain what's happening.
[01:23:55.418 --> 01:23:57.420]  Well, we got it from law enforcement.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.542]  That's the Project Dragnet database.
[01:24:00.542 --> 01:24:05.146]  The listing of names, phone numbers, telephone numbers, electronic surveillance since 2004 through 2010.
[01:24:08.861 --> 01:24:14.563]  I made sure the White House had the raw data on Donald Trump last Tuesday.
[01:24:14.563 --> 01:24:17.784]  We also shared it with some key members of Congress.
[01:24:17.784 --> 01:24:20.105]  One or two select members of Congress.
[01:24:20.105 --> 01:24:25.307]  And we're wanting to go and present this to the Department of Justice.
[01:24:25.307 --> 01:24:27.207]  Now, we're going to have one more story.
[01:24:27.207 --> 01:24:29.248]  I'll be writing it up tomorrow.
[01:24:29.248 --> 01:24:35.270]  And we can prove the extent to which Sheriff Arpaio was wiretapped
[01:24:35.831 --> 01:24:44.455]  Electronic surveillance, interference with his court case, and we're going to start to share that information as well with the White House.
[01:24:44.455 --> 01:24:45.836]  And again, I love Arpaio.
[01:24:45.836 --> 01:24:47.917]  Whether you love him or hate him, it's illegal.
[01:24:47.917 --> 01:24:49.057]  Obama openly sued him.
[01:24:49.057 --> 01:24:50.398]  The UN came after him.
[01:24:50.398 --> 01:24:51.158]  They went after him.
[01:24:51.158 --> 01:24:55.240]  George Soros spent, what was it, 30-something million against him, publicly we know of.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.461]  So if they can do this to him, anybody can do it.
[01:24:57.461 --> 01:25:01.223]  This is a lynching of a great sheriff and a patriot and a friend of Donald Trump.
[01:25:01.223 --> 01:25:03.824]  So the great news is, good law enforcement
[01:25:04.324 --> 01:25:08.589]  He's not going to sit here while they lie about Arpaio or President Trump.
[01:25:08.589 --> 01:25:19.222]  And Mike Zulu and Sheriff Arpaio are willing to come into Washington next week to brief members of the White House, members of Congress, Department of Justice.
[01:25:19.222 --> 01:25:22.246]  All they have to do at this point is ask
[01:25:22.958 --> 01:25:27.023]  The NSA to release the Project Dragnet database.
[01:25:27.023 --> 01:25:30.547]  The millions of names of people who have been under electronic surveillance.
[01:25:30.547 --> 01:25:33.931]  And the President can review that if he wants, privately.
[01:25:33.931 --> 01:25:35.953]  He should order them, give me the database.
[01:25:35.953 --> 01:25:37.155]  And he's already gotten it from you, but...
[01:25:38.075 --> 01:25:41.378]  Well, they've gotten the ones pertaining to the records of Donald Trump.
[01:25:41.378 --> 01:25:53.207]  Donald Trump's narrative, I think, changed last week when they realized that there were records showing he'd been wiretapped, electronic surveillance, in Trump Tower.
[01:25:53.207 --> 01:25:55.549]  But we've got in here... By the way, I've got to stop you.
[01:25:55.549 --> 01:25:57.071]  I'm going to give you the floor when we come back.
[01:25:57.071 --> 01:25:59.433]  But Dr. Corsi, you're a very humble man.
[01:25:59.433 --> 01:26:04.957]  I mean, you're the number one New York Times bestseller three times because of your intel connections.
[01:26:04.957 --> 01:26:05.558]  Folks, we don't...
[01:26:06.543 --> 01:26:08.464]  They call us fake news because we're so real.
[01:26:08.464 --> 01:26:10.165]  This is one of the biggest stories ever.
[01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.987]  Is this not one of the biggest stories of your career as a patriot?
[01:26:12.987 --> 01:26:14.968]  I mean, this is so big, I can't believe it.
[01:26:14.968 --> 01:26:16.389]  Of course, I knew this earlier in the week.
[01:26:16.389 --> 01:26:19.671]  I've had to just sit back and let you work, being very excited, obviously, about it.
[01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:23.573]  But seeing the president then respond, he checked with databases, they know.
[01:26:23.573 --> 01:26:28.996]  This is earth-shaking that they've bet everything against us, saying they didn't surveil him.
[01:26:28.996 --> 01:26:32.478]  When they bragged they surveilled him two months ago, and now we have the documents.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:41.105]  Well, and Alex, that's why I wanted to show you your record, because you could verify the cell phone, the phone number, the address, which no one knows you had.
[01:26:41.105 --> 01:26:42.986]  It's an older address.
[01:26:42.986 --> 01:26:46.369]  And my old cell phone that nobody in the family had, yeah.
[01:26:46.369 --> 01:26:56.775]  And he's going to recognize his cell phone numbers, he's going to recognize his father's phone numbers, his wife's phone numbers, his employees are going to recognize his employees' phone numbers.
[01:26:56.775 --> 01:26:59.017]  Trump has called me from these numbers!
[01:27:00.456 --> 01:27:01.317]  Yes, he called you.
[01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:07.760]  I mean, I showed some of these numbers in Washington and people recognized him immediately.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.381]  Trump's cell phone is in here.
[01:27:09.381 --> 01:27:11.182]  Trump's secretary?
[01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:13.184]  Secretary's in here.
[01:27:13.184 --> 01:27:14.825]  And every organization he owned.
[01:27:14.825 --> 01:27:22.009]  In fact, NSA was even wiretapping the summer house that Trump would stay in.
[01:27:22.009 --> 01:27:27.052]  They were wiretapping his golf courses and the people who ran the golf courses.
[01:27:27.592 --> 01:27:31.775]  They even at Mar-a-Lago know when he sold it, he kept a couple of apartments.
[01:27:31.775 --> 01:27:34.877]  They know how to target even those very rooms.
[01:27:34.877 --> 01:27:36.639]  Wait, Mar-a-Lago's on these lists.
[01:27:36.639 --> 01:27:43.484]  He was being, Donald Trump was being under electronic surveillance in, all through New York.
[01:27:43.484 --> 01:27:44.765]  And that's why he's so pissed.
[01:27:44.765 --> 01:27:47.527]  And that's why they've bet everything on saying he's a liar.
[01:27:48.328 --> 01:27:48.848]  I don't think so.
[01:28:07.941 --> 01:28:18.709]  And what really kind of shocked me was Ivana Trump, House of Ivana, with the address and the phone numbers, show up on the list as under electronic surveillance, starting in 2004.
[01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:24.893]  Now, I mean, again, this is Project Dragnet.
[01:28:24.893 --> 01:28:26.854]  And that's because he came out against the war.
[01:28:26.854 --> 01:28:29.736]  This is bipartisan attacks, but accelerates under Obama.
[01:28:29.736 --> 01:28:31.638]  So the big news is here.
[01:28:31.638 --> 01:28:36.301]  We've got him in documents, surveilled in the Obama era, showing the whole media is discredited.
[01:28:37.553 --> 01:28:40.255]  And also, I mean, he also had already run for president.
[01:28:40.255 --> 01:28:43.116]  I mean, he's trying to run for president going back into the 90s.
[01:28:43.116 --> 01:28:46.778]  Roger Stone documents that in his book, The Begging of the President, 2014.
[01:28:46.778 --> 01:28:50.000]  Donald Trump's been a public figure since the 1990s.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.742]  That's right, I want to be clear for everybody's safety.
[01:28:52.742 --> 01:28:56.003]  The addresses they've published, I am no longer at.
[01:28:56.003 --> 01:28:58.605]  But they have, they did publish one of my secret locations.
[01:29:00.339 --> 01:29:11.204]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people the true next generation in body armor.
[01:29:11.204 --> 01:29:18.988]  Basically what we're bringing to the InfoWars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[01:29:18.988 --> 01:29:24.931]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[01:29:25.011 --> 01:29:31.196]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[01:29:31.196 --> 01:29:32.156]  What did they really say about it?
[01:29:32.156 --> 01:29:34.999]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[01:29:34.999 --> 01:29:38.722]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[01:29:38.722 --> 01:29:41.644]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[01:29:41.644 --> 01:29:43.505]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:29:43.505 --> 01:29:44.526]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[01:29:44.526 --> 01:29:45.667]  It's got a 20-year warranty.
[01:29:45.667 --> 01:29:46.327]  It's waterproof.
[01:29:46.327 --> 01:29:46.808]  You can wear it.
[01:29:46.808 --> 01:29:47.508]  It's comfortable.
[01:29:47.508 --> 01:29:49.610]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.

[01:31:01.676 --> 01:31:05.799]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[01:31:05.799 --> 01:31:08.621]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:31:08.621 --> 01:31:10.123]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[01:31:10.123 --> 01:31:14.346]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:31:14.346 --> 01:31:18.129]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collected.
[01:31:18.129 --> 01:31:19.790]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:21.391]  They're gonna be coming after your gun.
[01:31:21.391 --> 01:31:21.792]  Oh, yeah.
[01:31:21.792 --> 01:31:23.913]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:31:23.913 --> 01:31:24.554]  At all.
[01:31:24.554 --> 01:31:25.535]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:31:26.015 --> 01:31:27.976]  You wonder what happened to America.
[01:31:27.976 --> 01:31:29.157]  They lost.
[01:31:29.157 --> 01:31:29.977]  We won.
[01:31:29.977 --> 01:31:32.338]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[01:31:32.338 --> 01:31:33.499]  It's time to ride, boss.
[01:31:33.499 --> 01:31:35.380]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:41.463]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:31:41.463 --> 01:31:43.824]  And beef was for supper.
[01:31:43.824 --> 01:31:44.884]  Revelation.

[01:33:32.112 --> 01:33:33.774]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:38.500]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.092 --> 01:33:47.217]  Now I just noticed during the break that DrudgeReport.com linked to our article that's on Infowars.com.
[01:33:47.217 --> 01:33:51.240]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:55.304]  Bombshell discovery shows targets of NSA Project Dragnet.
[01:33:55.304 --> 01:33:59.107]  Yes, I'm in the article, but I think we're going to change the headline to Donald Trump and his family.
[01:33:59.107 --> 01:34:01.209]  I don't, quite frankly, think I'm that important.
[01:34:01.209 --> 01:34:05.733]  Thank you for putting me in there, you know, Dr. Corsi, but this is what law enforcement gave you.
[01:34:05.733 --> 01:34:07.014]  This is an admitted database.
[01:34:07.594 --> 01:34:12.155]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation and others have broken down, but it's the center column.
[01:34:12.155 --> 01:34:15.416]  North Korea is threatening to nuke Japan and Korea right now.
[01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:16.957]  All hell's breaking loose.
[01:34:16.957 --> 01:34:18.257]  I just can't believe this.
[01:34:18.257 --> 01:34:23.359]  Mike Zulob headed up the Cold Case Posse for Sheriff Arpaio for many years.
[01:34:23.359 --> 01:34:24.739]  It's such great work.
[01:34:24.739 --> 01:34:32.982]  And of course, he was formerly a retired Bergen County, New Jersey detective and chief investigator of the Cold Case Posse and so much more.
[01:34:32.982 --> 01:34:36.643]  He was, of course, exposed to the whole fake birth certificate and the rest of it, but
[01:34:37.737 --> 01:34:39.258]  This isn't about being a talk show host.
[01:34:39.258 --> 01:34:41.760]  It's not about being up here and being famous.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.502]  This is really big stuff, folks.
[01:34:43.502 --> 01:34:45.423]  This is real.
[01:34:45.423 --> 01:34:50.448]  And the New York Times admitted in four articles by one author in
[01:34:51.909 --> 01:34:56.451]  January, that they were surveilling and using the archaic term wiretapping Trump.
[01:34:56.451 --> 01:35:00.073]  He used it and they said it's not called wiretapping, it's called intercepts or surveillance.
[01:35:00.073 --> 01:35:01.373]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:01.373 --> 01:35:04.875]  The point is, every phone call with the President-elect is recorded anyways.
[01:35:04.875 --> 01:35:06.196]  That was used against him.
[01:35:06.196 --> 01:35:07.956]  That's illegal, that's a leak.
[01:35:07.956 --> 01:35:17.721]  Instead of him getting them in trouble for what they've done, the Nixon-type crap, they turn it around and say he's crazy all over the news, none of this is happening.
[01:35:18.956 --> 01:35:30.622]  So good patriotic law enforcement in the last few weeks I know with Sheriff Arpaio outgoing and of course his former chief detective Mike Zula broke all this down.
[01:35:30.622 --> 01:35:36.325]  So he joins us via Skype, of course he does, but it just reminded me when I saw Drudge link to that.
[01:35:36.325 --> 01:35:42.368]  It was like six years ago it came out that the TSA had a secret database on Drudge and myself for criticizing him.
[01:35:43.578 --> 01:35:45.039]  Yeah, that's the article about detained.
[01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:51.964]  No, if you just search engine, it was a former congressman out of Atlanta.
[01:35:51.964 --> 01:35:55.647]  Yeah, that Bob Barr files lawsuit against TSA over drugs controversy.
[01:35:55.647 --> 01:35:58.950]  It's in the database, but the files are secret.
[01:35:58.950 --> 01:36:02.792]  So, they're using surveillance against constitutional
[01:36:03.686 --> 01:36:04.727]  Critics.
[01:36:04.727 --> 01:36:09.309]  It's not like we're some meth-dealing motorcycle gang or something, or have criminal records.
[01:36:09.309 --> 01:36:12.311]  They're using it against Sheriff Arpaio, and that's the other big news.
[01:36:12.311 --> 01:36:16.073]  People say, okay, great sheriff, great patriot, but he's out of office, whatever.
[01:36:16.073 --> 01:36:17.674]  Targeted by George Soros.
[01:36:17.674 --> 01:36:19.094]  These files have him all over.
[01:36:19.094 --> 01:36:20.175]  His family, everything.
[01:36:20.175 --> 01:36:22.096]  His court case, which they knew at the time.
[01:36:22.096 --> 01:36:25.638]  Everything they were saying was known before they got in court.
[01:36:25.638 --> 01:36:27.559]  Well, Obama made it his specialty to go after him.
[01:36:28.079 --> 01:36:37.804]  Using NSA surveillance against a citizen, a federal officer, a good standing sheriff to destroy him in a court case is so illegal.
[01:36:37.804 --> 01:36:40.585]  Do I have to explain that to people how illegal that is?
[01:36:40.585 --> 01:36:42.466]  So the Guardian, NSA files decoded.
[01:36:43.126 --> 01:36:44.327]  What the investigation means to you.
[01:36:44.327 --> 01:36:46.549]  We learned about Operation Dragnet.
[01:36:46.549 --> 01:36:52.074]  Now we learn, and I know Mike Zullo thought he was coming on tomorrow, we had to launch this now because of security issues.
[01:36:52.074 --> 01:37:05.965]  So, for the last 25 minutes I want Dr. Corsi to take over, because I'll interrupt if he doesn't, because I get so excited here, and then of course Mike, to go over this and you guys break down what's most pertinent.
[01:37:06.906 --> 01:37:14.232]  To say we're under threat, to say this is dangerous to even have this, or who gave it to us as risking their life, isn't grandstanding, folks.
[01:37:14.232 --> 01:37:16.033]  You want people to fight for America?
[01:37:16.033 --> 01:37:16.814]  Arpaio did it.
[01:37:16.814 --> 01:37:19.196]  They spent 30 plus million to destroy him.
[01:37:19.196 --> 01:37:23.019]  Okay, you want, you know, they've gone after Mike, they've gone after Corsi, they've gone after me.
[01:37:23.019 --> 01:37:23.819]  I'm not bitching.
[01:37:23.819 --> 01:37:25.741]  I'm just saying, this is a war, folks.
[01:37:25.741 --> 01:37:26.842]  You wonder why people don't fight?
[01:37:26.842 --> 01:37:28.123]  Because they get intimidated.
[01:37:28.123 --> 01:37:31.946]  So, Dr. Corsi, you take over and break this down with Mike.
[01:37:31.946 --> 01:37:33.027]  Great, is Mike here now?
[01:37:33.027 --> 01:37:33.507]  Do we have Mike on?
[01:37:33.507 --> 01:37:33.767]  Yes, he is.
[01:37:33.767 --> 01:37:34.328]  Mike is here.
[01:37:34.328 --> 01:37:35.709]  Mike is here.
[01:37:37.065 --> 01:37:47.260]  Mike, why don't you go over the background of how you got this database to me and what we discovered about Donald Trump and how you realized Trump was in this database.
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:47.661]  That's right.
[01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:48.462]  Mike Zulo.
[01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:49.183]  Take it over, my friend.
[01:37:50.165 --> 01:38:05.797]  Well, back in 2013, information came to us as we were conducting the birth certificate investigation that an individual by the name of Dennis Montgomery was looking to come forward as a whistleblower that he was in possession of the identities of 151,000 residents of Maricopa County.
[01:38:09.805 --> 01:38:31.318]  And it was also alluded to that he had information of millions of Americans, personal information, bank account information, and even it was alleged IRS information that he claimed was taken illegally by the federal government while he was employed as a contractor working for the NSA.
[01:38:32.199 --> 01:38:43.522]  In his employment, he was a computer software developer that developed, and it is documented, computer software programs that could breach computers undetected.
[01:38:43.522 --> 01:38:48.923]  And that was utilized for legitimate government purposes in the beginning.
[01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:58.466]  Mr. Montgomery had a falling out at one time with the federal government and was hired back to continue his work.
[01:38:59.802 --> 01:39:02.783]  And subsequently departed from there again.
[01:39:02.783 --> 01:39:14.005]  And when he came into the sheriff's office with this information, there were in fact 151,000 residents that he had their personal information.
[01:39:14.005 --> 01:39:17.786]  On top of that, what was shown to us was other individuals.
[01:39:17.786 --> 01:39:19.067]  Supreme Court justices.
[01:39:19.067 --> 01:39:20.087]  John Roberts was one.
[01:39:21.386 --> 01:39:27.290]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I believe, was in the database that we were shown.
[01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:28.791]  We had senators.
[01:39:28.791 --> 01:39:30.072]  We had movie actors.
[01:39:30.072 --> 01:39:31.954]  Clint Eastwood.
[01:39:31.954 --> 01:39:33.715]  And Alex, you were in there.
[01:39:33.715 --> 01:39:34.296]  I was in there.
[01:39:34.296 --> 01:39:35.557]  Sheriff Arpaio was in there.
[01:39:35.557 --> 01:39:37.678]  And this is back in 2007.
[01:39:37.678 --> 01:39:43.403]  This is before we did any other investigative work on anything related to that birth certificate or anything else.
[01:39:43.403 --> 01:39:45.184]  This information was in there.
[01:39:45.925 --> 01:39:48.107]  Well, this is an identity problem.
[01:39:48.107 --> 01:39:49.348]  There's identity theft.
[01:39:49.348 --> 01:39:53.251]  People's information now are in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.
[01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:56.755]  That's a target list of anybody that might be a faithful, good American.
[01:39:57.478 --> 01:39:57.918]  Yes.
[01:39:57.918 --> 01:39:59.539]  I mean, Sheriff Arpaio was in there.
[01:39:59.539 --> 01:40:01.699]  Our Chief Deputy was in there.
[01:40:01.699 --> 01:40:10.341]  So, Sheriff Arpaio decided to open up an investigation from the perspective that we have to safeguard our residents.
[01:40:10.341 --> 01:40:17.463]  It turned out, not only did he have 151,000 people in Maricopa County, but he had half a million people in the state of Arizona.
[01:40:17.463 --> 01:40:21.164]  It turned out that he had millions across the nation.
[01:40:21.164 --> 01:40:24.404]  Texas, California, New Jersey, Rhode Island.
[01:40:24.404 --> 01:40:26.685]  This sounds bigger than Snowden what's breaking right now.
[01:40:27.509 --> 01:40:29.229]  Well, and that's what's incredible.
[01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:32.030]  And let me tell you something about, you know, Mr. Montgomery.
[01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:36.311]  Mr. Montgomery, his credibility is challenged.
[01:40:36.311 --> 01:40:40.452]  And you have to understand now the agencies that he was working for.
[01:40:40.452 --> 01:40:44.232]  These people will destroy you in a heartbeat.
[01:40:44.232 --> 01:40:51.474]  But in the very beginning, Mr. Montgomery alerted myself and Detective Brian Makowicz when we went to Seattle to interview him.
[01:40:52.873 --> 01:40:59.517]  That the NSA was breaching attorney-client privilege communications.
[01:40:59.517 --> 01:41:06.701]  And that was three or four months, Alex, before Snowden ever released that information.
[01:41:06.701 --> 01:41:08.682]  So he was telling us about that.
[01:41:08.682 --> 01:41:13.185]  He was also telling us about things that are breaking now in the news.
[01:41:13.185 --> 01:41:20.830]  So to sit back and look at this and think that the claims that the President of the United States is making are invalid,
[01:41:22.110 --> 01:41:23.131]  I can't believe that.
[01:41:23.131 --> 01:41:36.000]  Now, Montgomery's information was turned over by the Sheriff's Office pursuant to a subpoena in a federal case that was going on here, a civil trial for immigration.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.845]  The investigation was then brought center stage and exposed in a public hearing.
[01:41:43.929 --> 01:41:47.731]  And this information, some of this I actually testified to.
[01:41:47.731 --> 01:41:52.433]  This information was turned over to the ACLU, Covington Burling.
[01:41:52.433 --> 01:41:55.074]  It was turned over to the DOJ.
[01:41:55.074 --> 01:42:01.397]  At no time did any agency ever come back and discredit this information.
[01:42:01.397 --> 01:42:04.859]  As this case was going on... I just want to interrupt briefly and I'll come back and have you have the floor.
[01:42:04.859 --> 01:42:05.999]  Please come back for a full hour.
[01:42:05.999 --> 01:42:07.000]  We have tomorrow, sir.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:07.540]  I know you're busy.
[01:42:08.359 --> 01:42:10.360]  I remember hearing about this at the time, just little pings.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.280]  Hey, you're in a database.
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:12.521]  I'm like, yeah, I know.
[01:42:12.521 --> 01:42:17.764]  So the point is, this has been going on for a while, and then to see President out there under attack.
[01:42:17.764 --> 01:42:21.065]  They admit they were surveilling him in the New York Times a month and a half ago.
[01:42:21.065 --> 01:42:22.246]  Now they say he's insane.
[01:42:22.246 --> 01:42:24.547]  Let me ask you this as we go to break.
[01:42:24.547 --> 01:42:25.968]  How dumb do they think we are, Mike?
[01:42:27.549 --> 01:42:42.388]  Alex, I don't know, because if they want to come out here and you have individuals from these agencies, these spy agencies if you will, come out and lie to Congress and then have to retract it, eventually you have to come to the conclusion that this stuff is going on.
[01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:45.250]  And it truly is going on.
[01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:50.172]  And the information that we were privy to, like I said, has been turned over.
[01:42:50.172 --> 01:42:54.493]  We got Mr. Montgomery to a federal judge with the assistance of Larry Klayman.
[01:42:54.493 --> 01:42:57.155]  This is breaking all, Larry Klayman, all of it.
[01:42:57.155 --> 01:42:59.475]  This is breaking right now, folks, here at InfoWars.
[01:42:59.475 --> 01:43:02.957]  Stay with us.
[01:43:02.957 --> 01:43:05.558]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:19.994 --> 01:43:26.002]  If you're receiving this broadcast, you are the resistance.
[01:43:26.002 --> 01:43:30.989]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:43:30.989 --> 01:43:35.676]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:43:37.312 --> 01:43:42.274]  Alright, I'm gonna get Mike Zullo on tomorrow for a full hour along with Dr. Corsi, Judge Arpaio, you name it.
[01:43:42.274 --> 01:43:44.154]  This is so big.
[01:43:44.154 --> 01:43:45.675]  It's probably one of the biggest things we ever broke.
[01:43:45.675 --> 01:43:48.896]  It's the top story now on DrugsReport.com.
[01:43:48.896 --> 01:44:01.020]  When this show ends in 13 minutes, I'm going to add a link to the recording of the live feed as it loops so we can add it to the article.
[01:44:04.619 --> 01:44:08.240]  I wanna go back to the, again, it's the top left link.
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.020]  We can blow that up for folks.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:15.321]  NSA documents surveillance on Trump family more.
[01:44:15.321 --> 01:44:17.161]  Project Dragnet.
[01:44:17.161 --> 01:44:18.881]  I mean, really the headline, that's powerful.
[01:44:18.881 --> 01:44:20.742]  Drugs always shows how to crystallize what's happening.
[01:44:20.742 --> 01:44:25.883]  That's really the headline for the whole broadcast today.
[01:44:25.883 --> 01:44:29.523]  But it's also new NSA whistleblower.
[01:44:29.523 --> 01:44:31.083]  And so I wondered what was going on.
[01:44:31.083 --> 01:44:33.724]  Corsi called me on Monday and said, okay,
[01:44:35.128 --> 01:44:36.068]  We got a database.
[01:44:36.068 --> 01:44:39.750]  I'm going to run it by people first because we got to check it.
[01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:42.851]  And I said, fine, I don't want to know about secret stuff.
[01:44:42.851 --> 01:44:56.017]  And then days later, we get a phone call from, let's just say, a former high-level person in the government, like as high as you get under the president, basically threats just started pouring in about everything.
[01:44:56.017 --> 01:44:56.698]  We're going to get you.
[01:44:56.698 --> 01:44:57.098]  Stop it.
[01:44:57.098 --> 01:44:57.498]  Stop it.
[01:44:57.498 --> 01:44:58.178]  Stop it.
[01:44:58.178 --> 01:44:59.059]  And I finally figured out
[01:44:59.892 --> 01:45:00.072]  What's
[01:45:18.626 --> 01:45:18.926]  I don't
[01:45:37.921 --> 01:45:41.163]  It's like they denied that they were spying on Trump when they admitted they were spying on Trump.
[01:45:41.163 --> 01:45:47.345]  So Mike Zula, again of the Cold Case Posse, and what happened to our pile yourself, we got like seven, eight minutes left.
[01:45:47.345 --> 01:45:48.406]  Please come on tomorrow.
[01:45:48.406 --> 01:45:50.167]  Please, all of you, cover this.
[01:45:50.167 --> 01:45:53.588]  But clearly, all hell's breaking loose when they had you all surveilled this week.
[01:45:53.588 --> 01:45:59.291]  Because I'm busy, and you're busy, but I kind of like stuff cooked on the burner, because I don't know what's going to happen with it.
[01:45:59.291 --> 01:46:02.132]  But let me tell you, this has really scared some people.
[01:46:02.132 --> 01:46:03.153]  Where do you think this is going?
[01:46:04.622 --> 01:46:07.624]  You know, Alex, like I said, this information was turned over.
[01:46:07.624 --> 01:46:15.469]  We were successful with Larry Klayman in getting Mr. Montgomery to a federal judge, and ultimately Larry Klayman got him to the FBI.
[01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:17.470]  And by the way, what a rock star, Larry Klayman.
[01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:19.571]  He has just devastated them on hundreds of fronts.
[01:46:19.571 --> 01:46:22.773]  We're not giving credit here, it's just, this is another patriot.
[01:46:22.773 --> 01:46:23.974]  Well, Larry's a patriot.
[01:46:23.974 --> 01:46:28.837]  And he moved heaven and earth to get Mr. Montgomery there.
[01:46:28.837 --> 01:46:30.819]  That's over two years ago.
[01:46:30.819 --> 01:46:32.620]  And no one has heard anything about this.
[01:46:33.873 --> 01:46:35.794]  It all got sealed inside court, so tell us.
[01:46:35.794 --> 01:46:36.995]  You've got the database.
[01:46:36.995 --> 01:46:37.835]  We put out excerpts.
[01:46:37.835 --> 01:46:40.056]  This totally proves what Trump's saying.
[01:46:40.056 --> 01:46:40.917]  No, I want to be clear.
[01:46:40.917 --> 01:46:41.937]  We don't have the database.
[01:46:41.937 --> 01:46:44.659]  You have the screenshots of the entries of the database.
[01:46:44.659 --> 01:46:47.120]  We have information that Montgomery gave us.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.741]  That's been turned over.
[01:46:48.741 --> 01:46:49.801]  Yes.
[01:46:49.801 --> 01:46:53.763]  This is Montgomery's rendition of God knows what.
[01:46:53.763 --> 01:46:59.106]  But it's clearly thousands of pages of screenshots of databases, so you're the expert as a detective.
[01:46:59.106 --> 01:46:59.626]  Tell us what it is.
[01:47:00.754 --> 01:47:04.816]  It's Montgomery's rendition of whatever information he was privy to.
[01:47:04.816 --> 01:47:06.978]  And that way, legally, we don't have secret documents.
[01:47:06.978 --> 01:47:08.939]  This is what your witness Montgomery said.
[01:47:08.939 --> 01:47:10.540]  No, we don't have secret documents.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:16.524]  Montgomery turned over, I believe, 37 hard drives to the FBI.
[01:47:16.524 --> 01:47:19.225]  Now, that's... Now, clearly, Trump's the president.
[01:47:19.225 --> 01:47:20.106]  He knows about this.
[01:47:20.106 --> 01:47:21.567]  Of course he tells him about it.
[01:47:21.567 --> 01:47:23.688]  Trump comes out and says, I'm going public the next week.
[01:47:25.256 --> 01:47:26.476]  That's what I understand.
[01:47:26.476 --> 01:47:27.817]  Yes.
[01:47:27.817 --> 01:47:28.457]  You're the expert.
[01:47:28.457 --> 01:47:29.797]  Just please, because I'm going to rub.
[01:47:29.797 --> 01:47:31.677]  I mean, tell us what else we need to know.
[01:47:31.677 --> 01:47:33.398]  Well, the fact is, of course, he's jumping in.
[01:47:33.398 --> 01:47:33.638]  Sorry.
[01:47:33.638 --> 01:47:34.518]  Go ahead, Doc.
[01:47:34.518 --> 01:47:34.878]  Jump in.
[01:47:34.878 --> 01:47:38.839]  I mean, I made sure the White House had this early last week.
[01:47:38.839 --> 01:47:41.039]  I think we did it Monday, Tuesday.
[01:47:41.039 --> 01:47:44.760]  And I let top people in the White House know it was coming.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:45.920]  The story was breaking.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.321]  Now, the records that we have
[01:47:49.119 --> 01:47:51.340]  You know, proof out.
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:55.141]  In fact, Alex, I just emailed in to you so you can have it printed out in the studio.
[01:47:55.141 --> 01:47:57.042]  You can see what the records look like.
[01:47:57.042 --> 01:47:58.662]  I've got some of them.
[01:47:58.662 --> 01:47:59.623]  Print me the rest of them.
[01:47:59.623 --> 01:48:00.063]  Here they are.
[01:48:00.063 --> 01:48:01.703]  I don't want to show too much of this.
[01:48:01.703 --> 01:48:02.244]  Don't show it.
[01:48:02.244 --> 01:48:05.605]  Yeah, it's got... Go ahead.
[01:48:05.605 --> 01:48:14.048]  These are, you know, database records and we... The key, and I think I want to make sure we end well at this point, is that I was in... This is a confidential document.
[01:48:14.048 --> 01:48:14.888]  Government eyes only.
[01:48:15.771 --> 01:48:31.223]  I was in Washington last week, and what we did is we sent out, I met with a top member of the House of Representatives, we met with a couple of, you know, to get the word on to Congress that we want to meet with the Department of Justice.
[01:48:31.223 --> 01:48:32.363]  I'm going to have another article.
[01:48:32.363 --> 01:48:34.765]  By the way, I'm going to cover this, but I'm going to show the top of it.
[01:48:34.765 --> 01:48:36.086]  Look at this.
[01:48:36.086 --> 01:48:38.528]  Project Dragnet Master Database Records.
[01:48:38.528 --> 01:48:39.709]  Let's get going, Doc.
[01:48:40.694 --> 01:48:57.177]  Well, I want to show, you know, tomorrow we have the information, as you said, of the wiretapping of Arpaio's court case, in which the lawyers, you know, were basically going forward with information that was being wiretapped.
[01:48:57.177 --> 01:49:04.299]  The lawyers were being wiretapped, things were going forward, you know, that the Department of Justice was intervening with the judges.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:08.641]  The Sheriff Arpaio was wiretapped during the trial.
[01:49:08.641 --> 01:49:10.942]  And that's what Mike Zula was starting to get at.
[01:49:10.942 --> 01:49:16.843]  Just that alone, they knew about from their source, then it came out in the news in the Snowden dump.
[01:49:16.843 --> 01:49:19.164]  Let's go back to him and then back to you.
[01:49:19.164 --> 01:49:25.546]  Finally, we want to come in, we'd like to come in to Washington next week and present this information.
[01:49:25.546 --> 01:49:31.887]  I think National Press Club, regardless, because the people will scare Trump and say, oh, look out, stay away, it might not be totally accurate.
[01:49:31.887 --> 01:49:32.928]  I think it should be the Press Club.
[01:49:32.928 --> 01:49:33.528]  I should come up there too.
[01:49:34.707 --> 01:49:41.575]  Well I think we should organize, and to the Department of Justice, I want to get into the Department of Justice, this information.
[01:49:41.575 --> 01:49:51.786]  Now that I think the White House is aware that this Project Dragnet, we have reason to believe, has been wiretapping Trump and his family.
[01:49:52.443 --> 01:49:53.524]  Back to 2004.
[01:49:53.524 --> 01:49:56.385]  And again, where would an NSA whistleblower go?
[01:49:56.385 --> 01:50:05.050]  They would go to Sheriff Arpaio, who was then the only law enforcement officer that had any courage in this country, other than maybe the Sheriff up in Milwaukee.
[01:50:05.050 --> 01:50:08.711]  You want to comment on that, Detective?
[01:50:08.711 --> 01:50:12.974]  Well, I think that's precisely why Sheriff Arpaio was approached.
[01:50:12.974 --> 01:50:18.977]  And, you know, like I said in the beginning, look, nobody... And notice, as soon as you got this info, all hell broke loose.
[01:50:19.952 --> 01:50:20.752]  Oh, yeah.
[01:50:20.752 --> 01:50:21.752]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:50:21.752 --> 01:50:22.773]  Absolutely.
[01:50:22.773 --> 01:50:29.354]  I mean, there's evidence that we had turned over that Sheriff Arpaio's phones were wiretapped.
[01:50:29.354 --> 01:50:35.576]  That evidence has been turned over to federal authorities, and nobody says anything about it.
[01:50:35.576 --> 01:50:36.776]  Wow.
[01:50:36.776 --> 01:50:37.177]  Wow.
[01:50:37.177 --> 01:50:40.397]  Well, I think they've bitten off more than they can chew, and I'm trying to act confident.
[01:50:40.397 --> 01:50:43.578]  We've got the president, the numbers show the people are awake.
[01:50:43.578 --> 01:50:46.179]  That's why they're so scared, though, Mike, is they know we're awake.
[01:50:47.779 --> 01:50:53.701]  Well, I think that it's a hard thing to start to cover up when you get caught lying and lying and lying.
[01:50:53.701 --> 01:50:55.421]  I think it's difficult to cover it up.
[01:50:55.421 --> 01:50:59.082]  I heard you earlier talking about parallel construction.
[01:50:59.082 --> 01:51:01.323]  I mean, that's what a lot of this is.
[01:51:01.323 --> 01:51:10.166]  You know, it's been explained to me that the way you could be targeted is they would take mass amounts of information all around you, but just to focus in on you.
[01:51:10.166 --> 01:51:11.806]  So it doesn't look like you were targeted.
[01:51:11.806 --> 01:51:12.606]  Exactly.
[01:51:12.606 --> 01:51:13.967]  I mean, this is something that has to be
[01:51:15.347 --> 01:51:19.488]  Really exposed and corrected now, and I want to be really clear.
[01:51:19.488 --> 01:51:23.789]  I don't believe everyone in these agencies is a bad actor.
[01:51:23.789 --> 01:51:30.250]  I don't believe everyone of these agencies is out to... Sure, there'll be morning briefings that were enemies out to bring down their agencies.
[01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:31.030]  No, we're not!
[01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:36.491]  They're trying to bring down the president that's got three trillion dollars in the stock market trying to make America great again.
[01:51:36.491 --> 01:51:38.332]  He's been surveilled illegally.
[01:51:38.332 --> 01:51:40.252]  Let's go after the criminals at the top.
[01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:44.080]  Well, you know, you have to look at it from another perspective.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.665]  I mean, you have to look at it and realize something.
[01:51:46.665 --> 01:51:48.850]  You know, Donald Trump did not have to do this.
[01:51:49.758 --> 01:51:52.460]  Donald Trump isn't getting compensated to do this.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:56.603]  Donald Trump is in the best years of his life and he's dedicating it to his country.
[01:51:56.603 --> 01:51:59.905]  And everything is being thrown out to man.
[01:51:59.905 --> 01:52:05.069]  So my position is on this is this information was turned over in federal court.
[01:52:05.069 --> 01:52:07.350]  It's been turned over to the FBI.
[01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:09.932]  Montgomery deserves some type of hearing.
[01:52:09.932 --> 01:52:13.435]  So Montgomery is the new Snowden and you're here now for the first time.
[01:52:13.435 --> 01:52:14.435]  His name is now known.
[01:52:14.435 --> 01:52:15.816]  They tried to keep it secret.
[01:52:15.816 --> 01:52:16.257]  Now it's known.
[01:52:17.133 --> 01:52:19.255]  He just needs to get his day in front of him.
[01:52:19.255 --> 01:52:20.596]  Briefly, tell us about this man.
[01:52:20.596 --> 01:52:23.799]  Tell us his full breakdown in like one minute again.
[01:52:23.799 --> 01:52:29.003]  Well, Dennis Montgomery has credibility issues because of things that were done to him.
[01:52:29.003 --> 01:52:33.027]  And, you know, whether or not any of that stuff is legitimate or not, I don't know.
[01:52:33.027 --> 01:52:33.687]  They're going to use it.
[01:52:33.687 --> 01:52:35.489]  They're going to use it.
[01:52:35.489 --> 01:52:38.671]  But the fact of the matter is, even bad guys have truthful information.
[01:52:39.690 --> 01:52:41.090]  That's just the truth.
[01:52:41.090 --> 01:52:45.171]  Well how the hell would he get all the real phone numbers to me and Ronald Trump and everybody else?
[01:52:45.171 --> 01:52:53.913]  Montgomery, Alex, Montgomery tried like I believe it's 12 times if not more to become a whistleblower and was turned away every step of the way.
[01:52:53.913 --> 01:52:58.254]  Well it's like the database hacking people and the people at Diebold that were hired for fraud.
[01:52:58.254 --> 01:53:04.495]  They would go hire people that even had convictions and stuff to run their programs because then they could just deny that, you know, oh you're a crook we don't listen to you.
[01:53:05.438 --> 01:53:07.079]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:53:07.079 --> 01:53:09.621]  And that seems to be what is going on.
[01:53:09.621 --> 01:53:11.302]  Bob Zullo, you never plug anything when you come on.
[01:53:11.302 --> 01:53:12.103]  You're such a great guy.
[01:53:12.103 --> 01:53:13.404]  Is there a Facebook, a Twitter?
[01:53:13.404 --> 01:53:15.225]  How do people stay in contact with you?
[01:53:15.225 --> 01:53:17.347]  I don't really want people to stay in contact with me.
[01:53:17.347 --> 01:53:17.627]  I understand.
[01:53:17.627 --> 01:53:18.267]  You're a patriot.
[01:53:18.267 --> 01:53:19.128]  Will you come on tomorrow?
[01:53:19.128 --> 01:53:20.109]  I know you're busy.
[01:53:20.109 --> 01:53:20.769]  Yeah, I will.
[01:53:20.769 --> 01:53:21.890]  It's going to be a huge tomorrow.
[01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:24.512]  Dr. Corsi, I know you've got an email on InfoWars.
[01:53:24.512 --> 01:53:27.094]  How do folks contact you with whistleblowing contacts?
[01:53:27.094 --> 01:53:29.015]  We're seeing the next Snowden here.
[01:53:29.015 --> 01:53:32.618]  Well, it's drc at InfoWars.com.
[01:53:33.257 --> 01:53:34.858]  Dr. C. I want to thank the crew.
[01:53:34.858 --> 01:53:35.459]  I want to thank you.
[01:53:35.459 --> 01:53:37.301]  I'm very honored to be associated with all this.
[01:53:37.301 --> 01:53:40.323]  Thanks to Drudge, DrudgeReport.com, linking to this.
[01:53:40.323 --> 01:53:42.645]  We'll have more out tonight on this and more tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:53:42.645 --> 01:53:46.349]  Central, if the Deep State doesn't SWAT team us, and I'm serious.
[01:53:46.349 --> 01:53:47.370]  Stay with us.
[01:53:47.370 --> 01:53:48.311]  Retransmission starts now.
