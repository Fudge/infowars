[00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:14.839]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.560]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.222]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:28.070]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.255]  I woke up at about 3.30 in the morning last night, and I couldn't go back to sleep.
[00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:36.056]  And I wrote down some notes.
[00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:37.458]  Of course, I'd forgotten and left at the house.
[00:00:38.547 --> 00:00:48.733]  But it was profound, and it was extremely simple, and it's something we've already talked about before, but it gets lost in everything.
[00:00:49.963 --> 00:01:00.591]  The globalists don't want us celebrating Christmas, or anything else that's old and cultural, because they want to remove everything and force-feed their new systems.
[00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:14.862]  That's why they're at war with everything traditional, and most things traditional are traditional because they're nice, and they work, and they're productive, and they're happy, and they punish badness and reward goodness.
[00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:21.319]  But once you flip the balance into evil, it becomes an evil economy and things just go downhill.
[00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.101]  You want to stay away from an evil economy and go towards a good one.
[00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:30.443]  Doesn't mean you're ever going to be in some utopia, but you want to be going towards the good end of the spectrum.
[00:01:30.443 --> 00:01:37.746]  And it just hit me that as libertarians, as patriots, as constructive people, we tend to have victories move on.
[00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:38.006]  It's that
[00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:43.929]  Quiet professionalism that you see in so many hard-working, smart, great people.
[00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:44.589]  They're confident.
[00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:49.053]  They don't need to sit there and tell you about it all day because they just are.
[00:01:49.053 --> 00:01:50.354]  And everybody picks up on it.
[00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:51.314]  Women pick up on it.
[00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:52.055]  Men pick up on it.
[00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:57.279]  I mean, that's when you've got what it takes, the right stuff, and other people don't.
[00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:02.783]  And the folks that don't have the right stuff, they're always trying to get together to take over the people that do.
[00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:05.285]  And then we're always trying to help the people that don't have the right stuff.
[00:02:06.104 --> 00:02:13.388]  Now the globalists don't have the right stuff, they've stolen power, but they think we don't have the right stuff now and want to kill us off because we don't want to play along with their ballgame.
[00:02:13.388 --> 00:02:15.549]  So it's a perversion.
[00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:25.394]  But that said, it hit me, we've got to celebrate these tax cuts, and I mean really celebrate them, and we've got to show how good they are on average.
[00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:33.878]  I had a chance to read over last night and again this morning when I woke up for about an hour, hundreds of bullet points in there, but there's more than 30 big ones, and it's
[00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:37.462]  I mean, one of the cleanest tax bills I've ever seen.
[00:02:37.462 --> 00:02:42.603]  It's got some pork barrel in there, but not one Democrat voted for it, which is completely shameful.
[00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:50.785]  And even a few Democrats on CNN had to come out and say, you know what, this really is a middle-class tax cut.
[00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:52.266]  You can't lie about it.
[00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:56.287]  The ultra-rich already wrote the laws to keep their money offshore.
[00:02:56.287 --> 00:03:02.669]  Trump just undid the central plank of the globalist taking the money offshore, and that's why I get
[00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:11.368]  I get viciously angry when I see Hillary Clinton and Michael Moore and all the usual suspects lying and playing on people's ignorance.
[00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:12.869]  I mean, it really makes me mad.
[00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:22.672]  The big banks and the ultra-rich, the Fortune 100, to a group, wrote the 40% or 38.9% tax.
[00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:24.213]  The big corporations wrote it.
[00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:31.096]  And I sit there with leftists as they go, oh, are you glad your rich friends, Alex, are going to get that big tax cut?
[00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.520]  People just walk by and sit in the street.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.623]  Oh, you're working for the rich people now!
[00:03:36.623 --> 00:03:38.625]  No, you buffoon!
[00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:42.469]  The ultra-rich wrote it to screw you!
[00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.211]  You pay all the taxes!
[00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:46.752]  Shock!
[00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:51.297]  Even CNN admits tax bill gives working families damn good money.
[00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.138]  1.5 trillion, baby!
[00:03:57.031 --> 00:04:02.516]  In fact, it even got rid of some of the tax exemptions for people making over a million dollars a year.
[00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:06.160]  If anything, it's a tax increase on nouveau riche.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.384]  Believe me, you're making a million bucks a year, that's not ultra rich.
[00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:13.127]  It's not 1% that has 70% of the money.
[00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:16.590]  We've done the math, it's .0000000042 of every service, like a whole bunch of zeros and then a 42.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:29.812]  So it's the point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero whatever 42 that are ruling the show and they want a monopoly.
[00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:34.397]  They want consolidation under Democrat globalist control over the world.
[00:04:34.397 --> 00:04:37.018]  You've seen middle classes shrink and the ultra-rich created.
[00:04:37.018 --> 00:04:45.281]  And it's the ultra-rich to a man and to a corporation, very few women, that are promoting this global socialist system because they're exempt from it.
[00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:53.124]  They transfer your wealth, take it for themselves, and Trump and all of us just blew a giant hole in it and the EU is panicking.
[00:04:53.124 --> 00:04:55.424]  The EU admits it's going to move our jobs back.
[00:04:55.424 --> 00:04:55.884]  Ha!
[00:04:55.884 --> 00:04:56.985]  They're threatening us too!
[00:04:58.942 --> 00:05:00.343]  Why is the fungus?
[00:05:00.343 --> 00:05:01.424]  Why is the mold?
[00:05:01.424 --> 00:05:03.165]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:04.125]  What is going on?
[00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:04.886]  What has changed?
[00:05:29.202 --> 00:05:30.623]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:05:30.623 --> 00:05:31.803]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:05:31.803 --> 00:05:32.604]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:05:32.604 --> 00:05:34.045]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:05:34.045 --> 00:05:38.587]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:39.307]  Get it today.
[00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:39.887]  Limited run.
[00:05:39.887 --> 00:05:41.308]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:45.970]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.312]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[00:05:49.312 --> 00:05:51.633]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:53.534]  Look at the response we're getting.
[00:05:53.534 --> 00:05:54.975]  We're changing the world together.
[00:05:54.975 --> 00:05:55.995]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:05:55.995 --> 00:05:56.736]  God bless you all.
[00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.192]  We've got it.
[00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:06.738]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:06.738 --> 00:06:11.083]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:17.369]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:20.332]  I couldn't
[00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:46.170]  Sleep at about 3 30 in the morning I got up because my brain was racing and I got up and wrote a bunch of notes but again I of course forgot left on the kitchen table breakfast table when I came into work today when I came into this war today that I'm very honored and very humbled to be a part of and
[00:06:48.314 --> 00:06:49.635]  It was so clear.
[00:06:49.635 --> 00:06:50.855]  It was all laid out right there.
[00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:53.216]  And again, all of it you're already going to know.
[00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:55.016]  I don't tell you anything you don't already know in your heart.
[00:06:55.016 --> 00:07:04.079]  The reason you listen and put up with me is at the time the show was a train wreck because of myself.
[00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:08.601]  Because you know deep down I am in this with you.
[00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:10.201]  And you are in this with me.
[00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:14.663]  And that's why they always attack and say I'm not real and I hate my listeners.
[00:07:15.657 --> 00:07:40.184]  When I get tears in my eyes when families run up to me and shake my hand, black, Hispanic, white, you name it, Asian, old, young, because they're counting on me and I feel weak in this fight sometimes because I know so much more and I don't have the energy or the skill to properly execute and perform operations that I know would turn everything around.
[00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.431]  I'm not the only person.
[00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:44.752]  You're not the only person.
[00:07:44.752 --> 00:07:45.953]  Trump's not the only person.
[00:07:45.953 --> 00:07:48.516]  And now, as we realize, we're here.
[00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:50.097]  And that there aren't just scum in the world.
[00:07:50.097 --> 00:07:51.699]  There aren't just backstabbers in the world.
[00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:56.423]  There aren't just vicious liars in the world.
[00:07:56.423 --> 00:07:57.744]  The worm is turning.
[00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:58.885]  And evil is panicking.
[00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:02.969]  They were all so sure that they were gonna bring in this global government.
[00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:04.691]  This is just Hillary that's failing.
[00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:05.792]  The Globalist said last year,
[00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.653]  In major publications, in their establishment publications, they said, emergency!
[00:08:11.653 --> 00:08:12.813]  Red alert!
[00:08:12.813 --> 00:08:15.855]  They knew internal polls had Trump 10-15 points ahead.
[00:08:15.855 --> 00:08:21.739]  They stole, we now know, over 7 million votes, not three and a half like Trump had earlier been told off of Pew Research.
[00:08:21.739 --> 00:08:24.320]  Harvard Research, it's over 7 million.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.963]  Hillary stole six states, five states, tried to steal six others.
[00:08:27.963 --> 00:08:29.583]  And we have all the evidence of that.
[00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:33.446]  Local, state, homeland security caught the Justice Department breaking in.
[00:08:34.892 --> 00:08:39.534]  With their cyber squads trying to flip the votes and stop them.
[00:08:39.534 --> 00:08:45.457]  So there's a civil war going on against the globalists that have hijacked the nation and those of us trying to take it back.
[00:08:45.457 --> 00:08:49.759]  It doesn't mean those of us on the side trying to bring sovereignty back are perfect.
[00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:52.021]  Or that any of the people that have even joined us are perfect.
[00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:53.922]  A lot of them can see which way the wind's blowing.
[00:08:53.922 --> 00:09:00.545]  And now as people realize we're going to win, it's going to accelerate the victory.
[00:09:01.673 --> 00:09:05.076]  And the globalists now know they're going to lose for good.
[00:09:05.076 --> 00:09:07.878]  They finally realized it in the last 48 hours.
[00:09:07.878 --> 00:09:09.420]  And I can feel their horror.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.781]  I can see their response.
[00:09:10.781 --> 00:09:13.063]  I can see people jumping ship even faster.
[00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:17.026]  This is the moment the president's got to be under maximum security.
[00:09:17.026 --> 00:09:20.249]  Everybody else has got to be under maximum guard.
[00:09:20.249 --> 00:09:22.011]  Watch your six right now.
[00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:23.172]  Because right now,
[00:09:24.204 --> 00:09:32.786]  Yesterday, when that bill passed and they went up there and had that celebration, it was absolutely, we turned the corner right there.
[00:09:32.786 --> 00:09:36.607]  We turned the corner right there.
[00:09:36.607 --> 00:09:44.150]  That didn't mean we turned all the corners, it didn't mean that we're perfect, that didn't mean we don't have a lot of big crises to face, North Korea, you name it.
[00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:52.772]  But spiritually, what started with that inauguration 11 months ago, and that declaration bringing God back in, the covenant,
[00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:58.109]  Saying it's about humanity, it's about workers, it's about the people.
[00:09:58.109 --> 00:10:01.931]  You're not just the people or the minority or the infighting group.
[00:10:01.931 --> 00:10:02.991]  You're the people.
[00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:03.852]  You're the workers.
[00:10:03.852 --> 00:10:04.893]  You're the builders.
[00:10:04.893 --> 00:10:06.613]  You're the strivers.
[00:10:06.613 --> 00:10:11.476]  It was invoking God and then saying, you are the celebration.
[00:10:11.476 --> 00:10:14.218]  You have value.
[00:10:14.218 --> 00:10:15.018]  It isn't just hype.
[00:10:15.018 --> 00:10:17.459]  It's what builds a culture.
[00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:22.042]  And then now, less than a year later, so many promises delivered.
[00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:29.242]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[00:10:29.242 --> 00:10:37.287]  And so we need to celebrate and be thankful for everything we've got.
[00:10:37.287 --> 00:10:45.031]  Being thankful, and I know I'm preaching to most of you that already know this, but to others, being thankful is the answer to being happy.
[00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:51.355]  And being honorable is the key to real wisdom.
[00:10:51.355 --> 00:10:51.475]  And
[00:10:53.439 --> 00:11:08.693]  The globalists are always going to attack those of us who stand up against them and say that we're the dishonorable ones, we're the liars, we're the bad ones and cobble things together and twist what we've done or take points when we've fallen and try to magnify that to make us all feel like we don't have a right to be free.
[00:11:08.693 --> 00:11:09.774]  But it's all a lie.
[00:11:09.774 --> 00:11:13.357]  It's all a false indictment by the accuser, by the devil.
[00:11:13.357 --> 00:11:14.298]  And that's what the spirit is.
[00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:20.019]  That's why they always say Jones doesn't believe what he's saying.
[00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:21.360]  Jones isn't real.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.283]  Jones is an actor because they don't want you to believe there's anybody else out there that thinks like you do.
[00:11:26.283 --> 00:11:28.925]  They're saying you're not real.
[00:11:28.925 --> 00:11:32.387]  The real reason they fear me is they know I'm real.
[00:11:32.387 --> 00:11:33.528]  And they know I'm committed.
[00:11:34.858 --> 00:11:41.383]  And they know I have will to stand against what they've done, thanks to God, putting wind in my sails.
[00:11:41.383 --> 00:11:43.044]  And they can't stand that.
[00:11:43.044 --> 00:11:45.205]  And of course, the proof is the pudding.
[00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.127]  Judge Treebots' fruits.
[00:11:47.127 --> 00:11:48.728]  We are destroying the globalists.
[00:11:48.728 --> 00:11:50.669]  We are breaking their corrupt world government.
[00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.671]  We are exposing the technocracies.
[00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.433]  We are unmasking and unveiling their monopolies.
[00:11:55.433 --> 00:12:03.919]  We are causing, together, a global accelerated awakening that has evil everywhere in a panic.
[00:12:05.908 --> 00:12:12.931]  And desperately coming out of their rat holes, out of their spider holes, out of their eel holes, to fight us now.
[00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:18.273]  Which only accelerates their defeat as we draw their fire.
[00:12:18.273 --> 00:12:20.073]  That's the key to this.
[00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:28.617]  They've now come into our keep, come into our castle, to destroy us in the night, and just like Beowulf, we're waiting.
[00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:33.458]  And as they try to flee, we slam their arm in the door and rip it off.
[00:12:33.458 --> 00:12:34.879]  We've still got to face other great evils.
[00:12:36.049 --> 00:12:44.435]  But the point is, this particular monster has already had its arm torn off and is bleeding to death, and its mother is going to fall next.
[00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:53.781]  Because we are going into the mountain next, where they molest the children, where they engage in the Satanism, where they carry out their operations.
[00:12:53.781 --> 00:12:57.383]  We are going into the mountain!
[00:12:57.383 --> 00:13:00.866]  And if some of us are destroyed, going to the mountain doesn't matter, for more of us will follow.
[00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:07.713]  And it won't be fear going into the mountain, it will be honor and the quest for liberty and freedom.
[00:13:07.713 --> 00:13:15.361]  And an honor to go into the mountain, into the enemy's own darkness, because we carry the light of Christ in our hearts.
[00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:21.967]  Ladies and gentlemen, the EU has completely uncloaked the grandson of the main Nazi fortune, Juncker,
[00:13:26.155 --> 00:13:28.940]  Who owns a country they hijacked in World War II, Luxembourg.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.644]  I mean, just arrest him immediately.
[00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:33.569]  Just the arrogant insanity of these people.
[00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:34.591]  Snaggletooth Nazi.
[00:13:36.613 --> 00:13:40.175]  Says, no, you violated international treaties.
[00:13:40.175 --> 00:13:43.518]  You can't cut taxes under world government combines.
[00:13:43.518 --> 00:13:47.060]  We've signed with you at the WTO.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.761]  You can't do this.
[00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:53.824]  You're going to move back all the jobs to the United States and raise your wages.
[00:13:53.824 --> 00:13:56.206]  They actually admit that Trump's for real.
[00:13:57.473 --> 00:14:11.121]  Articles are on Infowars.com with just screenshots of London Guardian, your Spiegel, EU fears unfair US tax bill will incentivize companies to move to America.
[00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:23.107]  And then I've got one right here out of the Associated Press where they announce and CNBC that you violate a global agreement.
[00:14:23.107 --> 00:14:23.768]  Let's pull that up.
[00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:25.527]  There it is.
[00:14:25.527 --> 00:14:28.251]  US tax reform breaks global rules.
[00:14:28.251 --> 00:14:30.775]  EU says, oh there's global rules?
[00:14:30.775 --> 00:14:31.896]  Where do you get rules from?
[00:14:31.896 --> 00:14:32.497]  A government!
[00:14:33.697 --> 00:14:38.479]  Been talking to us like we're five-year-olds for 50 years while you set up world government stealth.
[00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:46.842]  And as we said, all we gotta do is expose it, people will attack us, saying it doesn't exist, but when they finally go operational, everybody will go, what?
[00:14:46.842 --> 00:14:49.563]  You said this wasn't going on.
[00:14:49.563 --> 00:14:54.265]  The only people that bought the Kool-Aid and drank it was the globalists.
[00:14:54.265 --> 00:14:57.707]  And sure, they've stolen trillions and all this other crap.
[00:14:57.707 --> 00:15:03.309]  They've got Hollywood diseasing everything and brainwashing people, but that's the weak victims, and we're sad for them.
[00:15:04.824 --> 00:15:10.785]  But the thinking man and woman has got it, and they know, and the whole world's like, how dare you?
[00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:12.646]  We sucked America dry with big companies.
[00:15:12.646 --> 00:15:18.507]  They didn't help people in Mexico or people in China with this crud.
[00:15:18.507 --> 00:15:20.307]  They exploited them.
[00:15:20.307 --> 00:15:21.968]  They lowered global wages.
[00:15:21.968 --> 00:15:23.508]  Giant sucking sound downward.
[00:15:23.508 --> 00:15:25.688]  America was dragging the world up.
[00:15:25.688 --> 00:15:27.409]  Free market was dragging it up.
[00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:28.909]  Higher standards of living.
[00:15:28.909 --> 00:15:29.869]  People wanting more.
[00:15:29.869 --> 00:15:31.190]  People wanting to live better.
[00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.330]  Living longer.
[00:15:33.484 --> 00:15:37.485]  But Obama and them go to the third world and say, you can't have cars, you can't have air conditioners.
[00:15:37.485 --> 00:15:40.025]  These are the very ones, and they're going, what did you just do?
[00:15:40.025 --> 00:15:43.206]  You're going to give 1.5 trillion to the American people?
[00:15:43.206 --> 00:15:46.307]  We had our shoe on their neck!
[00:15:46.307 --> 00:15:48.427]  We had them right where we wanted them!
[00:15:48.427 --> 00:15:50.348]  You're not psychos like us, you're stupid!
[00:15:50.348 --> 00:15:51.108]  What's wrong with you?
[00:15:51.108 --> 00:15:54.448]  You're supposed to be vicious, and lying, and evil, and hate everybody!
[00:15:54.448 --> 00:15:56.109]  No, we're not Satanists, you understand?
[00:15:56.109 --> 00:15:57.029]  And we're coming for you!
[00:15:59.741 --> 00:16:01.221]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.

[00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:28.430]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.212]  Could you please take a picture of my family and me with my cell phone?
[00:16:31.212 --> 00:16:33.313]  Sure, Mrs. Anderson.
[00:16:33.313 --> 00:16:34.934]  Smile for the camera.
[00:16:34.934 --> 00:16:39.077]  Too bad hackers never get proper permission to access your cell phone or computer camera.

[00:18:07.742 --> 00:18:16.146]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:16.146 --> 00:18:21.028]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:21.028 --> 00:18:24.409]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:26.690]  We're good to go.
[00:18:49.855 --> 00:18:56.158]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:18:56.158 --> 00:18:58.579]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:18:58.579 --> 00:19:03.221]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[00:19:27.837 --> 00:19:37.966]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:19:38.206 --> 00:19:40.347]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:15.717 --> 00:20:21.681]  So the globalists tell you, the liberty movement's a fake, it's a fraud, it won't deliver.
[00:20:21.681 --> 00:20:27.166]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:36.993]  They're the ones that deliver tyranny and starvation and impoverished populations and oppressed peasantries.
[00:20:36.993 --> 00:20:42.197]  They're the ones that deliver racial division, culture war,
[00:20:43.595 --> 00:20:49.559]  They're the ones that deliver the sexualization of children and 50 plus percent of black people never being born.
[00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:50.499]  They're the fake left.
[00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.620]  They're the tyrants.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.881]  They're the parasites.
[00:20:52.881 --> 00:20:58.084]  They're the people that tell you they're coming to take care of you, but really they're going to domesticate you and turn you into a slave.
[00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:12.719]  We're delivering on the free market, renaissance, enlightenment, Americana that pulled the world out of the dark ages and put us on the road to the stars.
[00:21:12.719 --> 00:21:20.424]  Extended life and the secrets of the universe that our father is ready for us to enjoy, but we have to prove ourselves.
[00:21:20.424 --> 00:21:26.509]  We won't just be given the keys to the galaxy and the keys to the universe without first being tested.
[00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:29.830]  And that's what this is!
[00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.531]  Make no mistake, that's why the enemy covets it.
[00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:34.331]  That's why they hate humanity.
[00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:41.033]  The globalists are fallen, twisted souls that seek to make greater men and women their slaves.
[00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:46.155]  Always seeking, ever hungry for the blood of the innocents.
[00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:53.858]  And I think about how the media, all over Twitter, Facebook, everywhere, I wasn't even looking for it, and I saw, look at Tim Scott, the Uncle Tom,
[00:21:57.264 --> 00:22:01.750]  You know, the beautiful part about our rallies is about half the folks there are, quote, minorities.
[00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.273]  The media panicked about that when we had one at the RNC.
[00:22:04.273 --> 00:22:06.095]  They said, yes, it was very frightening.
[00:22:06.095 --> 00:22:08.518]  Half the folks there were black or Hispanic or Asian.
[00:22:08.518 --> 00:22:09.960]  Probably more than that.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.741]  Everybody got along great.
[00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:18.901]  But see, by telling you, oh, blacks aren't welcome in the Republican Party or in the Tea Party, then blacks don't go.
[00:22:18.901 --> 00:22:24.924]  That's like the White House Chief of Staff, Kelly, came out and said, we're looking for all qualified applicants.
[00:22:24.924 --> 00:22:30.506]  Please, you know, if you're a minority, we're not getting minority requests here.
[00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:33.694]  We just want confident people.
[00:22:33.694 --> 00:22:36.437]  And that's how that self-segregation works.
[00:22:36.437 --> 00:22:39.700]  And now the colleges are teaching women don't go around men.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.882]  Men don't go around women.
[00:22:40.882 --> 00:22:41.703]  Blacks stay over here.
[00:22:41.703 --> 00:22:42.504]  Hispanics over here.
[00:22:42.504 --> 00:22:43.204]  Whites over here.
[00:22:43.204 --> 00:22:45.507]  They're setting up a prison.
[00:22:45.507 --> 00:22:50.052]  And then hyping up stuff and staging false hate crimes.
[00:22:52.014 --> 00:23:05.860]  Tim Scott, who had tears in his eyes, talking about President Trump, who, it's real affirmative action, and if you really want to do it, even though it discriminates, there has been past problems, but it's actually teach somebody how to fish, don't give them fish, they're going to deploy.
[00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:08.080]  We're good to go.
[00:23:28.564 --> 00:23:29.324]  Call him Uncle Tom.
[00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:30.505]  Actually, read Uncle Tom.
[00:23:30.505 --> 00:23:31.485]  Uncle Tom wasn't a wimp.
[00:23:31.485 --> 00:23:32.546]  He was a Christ figure.
[00:23:32.546 --> 00:23:34.566]  Doesn't mean you don't always lay down.
[00:23:34.566 --> 00:23:35.867]  You don't always stand up.
[00:23:35.867 --> 00:23:36.447]  No one to hold him.
[00:23:36.447 --> 00:23:37.387]  No one to fold him.
[00:23:37.387 --> 00:23:40.749]  But that Christ figure, Christ wasn't a wimp.
[00:23:40.749 --> 00:23:44.510]  At that point, or Gandhi wasn't a wimp, or Martin Luther King wasn't a wimp.
[00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.371]  I mean, Martin Luther King, you call him Uncle Tom.
[00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:48.672]  He got killed being loving and being a good person.
[00:23:49.451 --> 00:23:54.855]  So people don't even know what Uncle Tom means, because the Democrats took it and turned it into a pejorative by the 1870s.
[00:23:54.855 --> 00:23:56.096]  Look up who did it.
[00:23:56.096 --> 00:23:59.179]  I wanted to check my memory, so I went and read up on the history this morning.
[00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:01.480]  Again, they flip everything.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:13.129]  You got the blacks running towards the KKK party because they don't know any better, because they've been lied to by the schools like everybody else doesn't know any better.
[00:24:13.129 --> 00:24:16.472]  So, it's just incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:24.131]  And of course, it was Uncle Tom's cabin that moved everybody to finally embrace abolitionists and not want to have slavery anymore.
[00:24:24.131 --> 00:24:29.772]  It was that book about the Christ figure, Uncle Tom, that actually triggered all of that.
[00:24:29.772 --> 00:24:36.234]  And by the end of the Civil War, millions of dead, by the end, to stop slavery wasn't started over that.
[00:24:36.234 --> 00:24:42.795]  But see, they take that victory away from you and say, oh, he was a bad, pathetic person that groveled and everything.
[00:24:42.795 --> 00:24:43.735]  He was servile.
[00:24:43.735 --> 00:24:44.636]  He was all these other things.
[00:24:47.116 --> 00:24:51.300]  If you're in front of all the cameras and your enemy's about to kill you, it destroys them when they kill you.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.784]  Was Obi-Wan Kenobi a wimp at the end when he lets Darth Vader chop him in half?
[00:24:55.784 --> 00:25:01.370]  No, he knows it's about to commit the next generation of the fight.
[00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.111]  He's done at this point.
[00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:04.333]  He's also going to buy some time.
[00:25:05.523 --> 00:25:15.425]  And again, that's fiction, Uncle Tom's fiction, but it helps people understand what real heroism is, at the point that you need to let people kill you.
[00:25:15.425 --> 00:25:22.046]  If you're the spirit decides the time, then you don't fight, you let them kill you, because it brings them down.
[00:25:22.046 --> 00:25:24.687]  Because an hour later, you blow up the Death Star.
[00:25:24.687 --> 00:25:27.768]  Those are all allegories of how things really work.
[00:25:27.768 --> 00:25:29.248]  Martin Luther King blew up the Death Star.
[00:25:31.172 --> 00:25:35.576]  Charlton Heston, marching with him to help end real racism, blew up the Death Star.
[00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:39.419]  Those that got blown up came back with, hey, we'll take control of these people this way.
[00:25:39.419 --> 00:25:40.640]  And they've done it!
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:48.006]  And they've taught racism and horrible wickedness and horrible, vicious attacks by black people against whites and others all over the place.
[00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:50.468]  10 to 1, 20 to 1, 30 to 1, depending on the city.
[00:25:50.468 --> 00:25:53.090]  And the media covers it up, and they won't let you see it.
[00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:58.174]  It's not to demonize blacks, it's to say what you're doing is wrong, just like KKK doing stuff that's wrong.
[00:25:58.174 --> 00:25:59.195]  Stop it, it's evil.
[00:26:00.077 --> 00:26:01.579]  Because most people aren't psychopaths.
[00:26:01.579 --> 00:26:03.681]  They make excuses for why they go out.
[00:26:03.681 --> 00:26:05.663]  Most people that were KKK weren't psychopaths.
[00:26:05.663 --> 00:26:07.004]  They were bought into it.
[00:26:07.004 --> 00:26:09.066]  They were manipulated into it.
[00:26:09.066 --> 00:26:14.472]  Same thing with blacks that now act like the KKK, but on a much wider scale of true persecution.
[00:26:14.472 --> 00:26:15.673]  But see, it's all okay because
[00:26:16.428 --> 00:26:20.192]  The old KKK people that control the KKK are in control of you.
[00:26:20.192 --> 00:26:23.355]  They weren't believing any of that stuff, people that control the KKK.
[00:26:23.355 --> 00:26:30.021]  They wanted to control the poor farmers that were their real competition by putting them into a secret society group they could control, a gang.
[00:26:31.164 --> 00:26:32.385]  See, these people know what they're doing.
[00:26:32.385 --> 00:26:34.446]  These parasites are very, very smart.
[00:26:34.446 --> 00:26:41.090]  Let's go out to break with Tim Scott that they hate so much, because he's like a Moses to lead black folks off the plantation.
[00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:48.475]  Then we'll come back with a powerful video that McBrain's put together, because Trump is going to now go after the welfare system.
[00:26:48.475 --> 00:26:50.997]  They're going to say that they're killing everybody, but that's not what's happening.
[00:26:50.997 --> 00:26:57.581]  We're literally taking people and not letting them be domesticated from the company store, like they had whites as slaves as sharecroppers.
[00:26:57.581 --> 00:26:58.281]  Here it is.
[00:26:58.281 --> 00:26:58.942]  Well, Mr. President,
[00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:08.396]  During one of those conversations that we had, we talked about ways to improve distressed communities throughout this country.
[00:27:08.396 --> 00:27:16.202]  52 million Americans living in distressed communities, and we talked about legislation that can move those communities forward.
[00:27:16.202 --> 00:27:17.683]  And you said yes.
[00:27:17.683 --> 00:27:26.389]  And as a part of this tax reform package, the Investing and Opportunity Act has been included, which will bring trillions of dollars.
[00:27:27.515 --> 00:27:33.218]  And to poor communities, because of your willingness to listen.
[00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:39.321]  Thank you.
[00:27:39.321 --> 00:27:39.582]  Thank you.
[00:27:51.969 --> 00:27:58.634]  Let me just say to those Americans who are watching this process, this is not about Washington.
[00:27:58.634 --> 00:28:01.596]  It's not about the left.
[00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:03.757]  It's not about the right.
[00:28:03.757 --> 00:28:11.142]  It's about single parent moms who are looking for a reason to be hopeful in 2018.
[00:28:13.166 --> 00:28:19.803]  This tax reform plan delivers for the average single mother a 70% tax cut.
[00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:32.598]  For the average family who's working paycheck to paycheck, looking for ways to be hopeful about their future.
[00:28:32.598 --> 00:28:36.281]  To have an extra night for dinner out at a restaurant.
[00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:41.205]  This tax reform package cuts their taxes by nearly 60%.
[00:28:43.767 --> 00:28:55.191]  And because of folks like Marco Rubio and Ivanka, when you think about the folks with kids in the household, this plan doubles the child tax credit.
[00:28:57.819 --> 00:29:01.161]  Hey, Daniel Brinkman, why Numana Storable Foods?
[00:29:01.161 --> 00:29:02.522]  We believe in freedom.
[00:29:02.522 --> 00:29:05.924]  America needs strong, independent families to endure what's ahead.

[00:30:28.134 --> 00:30:34.218]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.

[00:30:35.939 --> 00:30:37.540]  I want to plow into all of this.
[00:31:01.431 --> 00:31:18.598]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:31:18.598 --> 00:31:20.719]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:31:20.719 --> 00:31:24.660]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.921]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but

[00:31:34.346 --> 00:31:36.988]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:31:36.988 --> 00:31:39.790]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.272]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:42.272 --> 00:31:51.478]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:31:51.478 --> 00:31:55.921]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:31:56.201 --> 00:31:58.482]  No!
[00:31:58.482 --> 00:32:02.885]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:02.885 --> 00:32:10.970]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:16.253]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:32:16.253 --> 00:32:18.795]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:32:18.795 --> 00:32:23.017]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:32:23.017 --> 00:32:25.459]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:32:26.139 --> 00:32:33.364]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:32:33.364 --> 00:32:41.450]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:48.635]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:50.076]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:32:50.076 --> 00:32:51.898]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:52.718 --> 00:32:56.180]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:02.064]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:02.064 --> 00:33:04.685]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.941 --> 00:33:28.209]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:33:28.209 --> 00:33:30.271]  I hereby declare this to be...
[00:33:37.536 --> 00:33:39.737]  It's a military mission in North St.
[00:33:39.737 --> 00:33:40.378]  Louis.
[00:33:40.378 --> 00:33:47.601]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:33:47.601 --> 00:33:52.403]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[00:33:52.403 --> 00:33:53.444]  Guns will be taken.
[00:33:53.444 --> 00:33:54.805]  No one will ever be armed.
[00:33:54.805 --> 00:33:55.625]  We will take all weapons.
[00:33:55.965 --> 00:33:58.267]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:33:58.267 --> 00:34:02.911]  It has really brainwashed people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:34:02.911 --> 00:34:03.772]  Enough.
[00:34:03.772 --> 00:34:04.552]  Enough.
[00:34:04.552 --> 00:34:05.633]  Enough.
[00:34:05.633 --> 00:34:05.994]  Enough.
[00:34:05.994 --> 00:34:10.597]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:34:10.597 --> 00:34:14.521]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:34:14.921 --> 00:34:21.808]  NSKS Late News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[00:34:21.808 --> 00:34:22.108]  Us.
[00:34:22.108 --> 00:34:26.772]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents.
[00:34:26.772 --> 00:34:30.015]  Or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:34:30.015 --> 00:34:32.678]  If you got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:34:33.718 --> 00:34:35.319]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:34:35.319 --> 00:34:36.340]  All of its big requests.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:42.445]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:34:42.445 --> 00:34:47.408]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky but this is only a drill.
[00:34:47.408 --> 00:34:50.691]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect.
[00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:52.232]  They ordered them all to do this to make a case of pollution.
[00:34:52.232 --> 00:34:57.116]  Now the military has all the documents.
[00:34:59.836 --> 00:35:04.883]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[00:35:04.883 --> 00:35:06.985]  You're in your apartment!
[00:35:06.985 --> 00:35:08.347]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[00:35:08.347 --> 00:35:10.109]  But now Chicago doesn't want U.S.
[00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:12.031]  troops, they want U.N.
[00:35:12.031 --> 00:35:13.593]  Predators won't.
[00:35:13.593 --> 00:35:14.575]  We will never see it coming.
[00:35:18.641 --> 00:35:21.524]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[00:35:21.524 --> 00:35:30.753]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[00:35:30.753 --> 00:35:36.218]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[00:35:36.218 --> 00:35:41.283]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[00:35:41.283 --> 00:35:43.345]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:47.862]  We are on the march.
[00:35:47.862 --> 00:35:49.603]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:35:49.603 --> 00:35:55.645]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:35:55.645 --> 00:36:06.609]  You can feel the energy rising.
[00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:25.254]  And the threat will persist of misplaced powers.
[00:36:25.254 --> 00:36:28.535]  We're not out of the woods, but we've turned around.
[00:36:28.535 --> 00:36:29.436]  We're going the right way.
[00:36:29.436 --> 00:36:31.816]  We're getting to cut down the evil.
[00:36:31.816 --> 00:36:34.777]  We're getting to cut the taxes.
[00:36:34.777 --> 00:36:35.138]  And even
[00:36:37.769 --> 00:36:47.155]  One of the top CNN hosts has been forced to come out and admit it's up on Infowars.com, the video, and the tweet.
[00:36:47.155 --> 00:36:52.738]  I'm going to play that video coming up, if I didn't mention, to get that to the crew.
[00:36:52.738 --> 00:37:03.465]  Where even, even CNN admits that it helps working families and it's damn good money.
[00:37:04.438 --> 00:37:06.118]  CNN's John King.
[00:37:06.118 --> 00:37:09.539]  Tax cut bill gives damn good money to working class.
[00:37:09.539 --> 00:37:15.101]  CNN host praises bill passed with zero Democrat support.
[00:37:15.101 --> 00:37:17.821]  I wonder how long John King is going to be there.
[00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:20.542]  By the way, I had that in my stack, but I can't find it.
[00:37:20.542 --> 00:37:22.042]  Will you guys reprint it for me and get the video?
[00:37:22.042 --> 00:37:22.843]  I'm sure we do.
[00:37:22.843 --> 00:37:27.904]  But that's pretty powerful information.
[00:37:27.904 --> 00:37:32.105]  Because it's $1.5 trillion, and most of it goes to the middle class and working families.
[00:37:33.254 --> 00:37:37.957]  The big banks, the big insurance companies, the big Fortune 100 pay almost no tax.
[00:37:37.957 --> 00:37:39.577]  They've written the laws to be offshore.
[00:37:39.577 --> 00:37:55.206]  And Trump annihilated that with a cut from 38.9% on corporations to 15%.
[00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:58.488]  Now what you've got to understand, ladies and gentlemen, why this is such a big deal
[00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.960]  I know I'll keep harping.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.182]  I know you know this, most of you.
[00:38:03.182 --> 00:38:06.588]  Please tell your friends and family because this is key.
[00:38:06.588 --> 00:38:14.421]  The UN, the globalists, all of them are running around saying that, oh look, Trump's breaking global rules.
[00:38:16.783 --> 00:38:18.564]  There are no global rules.
[00:38:18.564 --> 00:38:27.490]  The rules are screw America and the West over, transfer power to authoritarian countries, where globalists that sold our countries out ally themselves with the other authoritarians.
[00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:35.635]  It's authoritarian monopoly men and crony capitalists and communist dirtbags against the Renaissance, against the real liberals.
[00:38:35.635 --> 00:38:45.102]  If you really study what it is under classical analysis, if Thomas Jefferson was looking at this, he'd say those are monopoly groups just like a royal system, but worse.
[00:38:46.035 --> 00:38:47.916]  There's not even any honor.
[00:38:47.916 --> 00:38:51.198]  Nobody has to even take the field in the elite.
[00:38:51.198 --> 00:38:55.921]  And... They are putting us under serfdom.
[00:38:55.921 --> 00:38:59.243]  Anybody that was classically trained would see it in two seconds.
[00:38:59.243 --> 00:39:00.464]  If you're classically educated.
[00:39:00.464 --> 00:39:06.508]  You gotta go back and educate yourself on the classics, not the modern baloney.
[00:39:06.508 --> 00:39:10.790]  Intellectuals were too arrogant 300, 400, 500 years ago to lie.
[00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.492]  They might be distorted in their views, but they told you what they thought.
[00:39:14.875 --> 00:39:27.570]  This whole lying on purpose in media is a newer thing in the last 200 years or so, because before 200 years ago most people, the printing press was 500, but it wasn't ubiquitous until, or most people reading until about...
[00:39:28.507 --> 00:39:33.508]  Two hundred years ago, it was only intellectual to intellectual, elite to elite, so they were all very out in the open.
[00:39:33.508 --> 00:39:36.549]  And they still do that in globalist publications with each other.
[00:39:36.549 --> 00:39:38.269]  They act like we're idiots, we never read it.
[00:39:38.269 --> 00:39:39.629]  We went, read it, and brought it.
[00:39:39.629 --> 00:39:42.390]  Everybody said, look, they're saying this, they're going to do this.
[00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.051]  Oh, shut up, you racist kook, nutball, whatever.
[00:39:45.051 --> 00:39:47.011]  You know, just shut up and go away.
[00:39:47.011 --> 00:39:52.252]  But I'm like, hey, finally the public did listen.
[00:39:52.252 --> 00:39:54.172]  We'll play the McBrain piece when we come back to the next segment.
[00:39:54.172 --> 00:39:56.273]  I'm already burning through this segment.
[00:40:00.393 --> 00:40:03.699]  How long is that piece?
[00:40:03.699 --> 00:40:11.552]  Oh, so I... See, I have this whole thing where they do this great job on these promos on the other side, but then I get a video list that tells me the length.
[00:40:12.688 --> 00:40:17.090]  But then, those videos never get put on the video list with this group, so then I don't ever know.
[00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:23.634]  The only reason I'm saying it on air is because I've asked about 200 times, and I'm asking nicely, for just an email to be sent, or a message.
[00:40:23.634 --> 00:40:27.496]  Everybody's doing a great job, so that I can then know the length of time so I don't have to ask it on air.
[00:40:27.496 --> 00:40:31.338]  Because a lot of folks think, you know, I'm just asking these things on air to pontificate for no reason.
[00:40:31.338 --> 00:40:37.181]  That just goes into the whole computing process of what to do, and I'm kind of teleprompter free, so what we do is,
[00:40:37.861 --> 00:40:38.101]  I think?
[00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:02.105]  Fourteen and a half or whatever it is.
[00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:07.487]  And then we've got a 38.9, and our own government wrote it that way to make the jobs go to China.
[00:41:07.487 --> 00:41:09.107]  You wonder why everything went there.
[00:41:09.107 --> 00:41:12.149]  Well, they had a tax rate less than half of ours.
[00:41:12.149 --> 00:41:19.371]  And then you wonder why everybody laundered their money through Ireland and moved even more jobs there, because they had zero.
[00:41:19.371 --> 00:41:21.992]  Remember the big success story, Ireland, it's incredible.
[00:41:21.992 --> 00:41:23.173]  And Trump tried to get zero.
[00:41:25.842 --> 00:41:31.946]  If we had zero corporate income tax, everyone would come back here just like it was before when we set this whole thing up.
[00:41:31.946 --> 00:41:34.428]  And we had 80% of the world's industry.
[00:41:34.428 --> 00:41:36.149]  By the 80s, it was half of it.
[00:41:36.149 --> 00:41:37.730]  Now it's like 20% of it.
[00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:41.533]  Within five years, you'd have half the stuff moved back here.
[00:41:42.353 --> 00:41:45.015]  At real wages, and then that would lift the whole world up.
[00:41:45.015 --> 00:41:46.356]  Every economist knows this.
[00:41:46.356 --> 00:41:48.418]  But they want a consolidation.
[00:41:48.418 --> 00:41:51.440]  I know I keep harping and harping and harping and harping.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.781]  It's because this is everything.
[00:41:52.781 --> 00:42:00.907]  A rigged political and corporate system to screw the average person over, make you dependent, and put you on welfare so they can run your life.
[00:42:00.907 --> 00:42:04.470]  And that's the clip that we'll play when we come back at the start of the next segment.
[00:42:06.872 --> 00:42:08.573]  I haven't plugged yet this hour.
[00:42:08.573 --> 00:42:09.334]  It's free will.
[00:42:09.334 --> 00:42:14.157]  We don't take your money like MSNBC got with billions in stimulus money.

[00:46:08.345 --> 00:46:15.629]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.

[00:46:29.392 --> 00:46:41.514]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:46:41.974 --> 00:46:44.456]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:29.784 --> 00:47:31.245]  I got a question, folks.
[00:47:31.245 --> 00:47:50.333]  Will John King of CNN get fired for admitting the tax overhaul cuts of Trump that we all just had a huge victory with is, quote, damn good money the American people and actually is a real middle class slash poor people tax cut that is basically JFK-esque.
[00:47:50.333 --> 00:47:57.976]  Classic Democrats before they became total, you know, modern psychopath or classic northern Democrat, not southern Democrat.
[00:47:58.376 --> 00:48:14.772]  We're going to play that clip in a moment, but first, Jeremy McBrien put together this powerful video that has Trump introducing the fact that next up is welfare reform, getting folks off of the spoiled, rotten, brainwashing Democrat plantation.
[00:48:14.772 --> 00:48:15.113]  Here it is.
[00:48:15.113 --> 00:48:20.938]  I know people that work three jobs, and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all.
[00:48:21.736 --> 00:48:33.764]  And the person who's not working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person that's working his and her ass off.
[00:48:33.764 --> 00:48:35.625]  And it's not going to happen.
[00:48:35.625 --> 00:48:38.567]  Not going to happen.
[00:48:38.567 --> 00:48:42.009]  Give me my food stamps.
[00:48:42.009 --> 00:48:44.731]  Do you really want to work or do you just want to get a free check?
[00:48:48.007 --> 00:48:50.189]  There's a sign behind you that says Waverly Job Center.
[00:48:50.189 --> 00:48:52.211]  Do you have any intention of going in to get a job?
[00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:55.434]  Or are you just going to get the food stamps?
[00:48:55.434 --> 00:48:58.157]  I'm not looking for a job.
[00:48:58.157 --> 00:49:03.662]  Why should I have to go work at retail and deal with snobby customers?
[00:49:03.662 --> 00:49:04.903]  Why?
[00:49:04.903 --> 00:49:08.187]  Why should I have to dare choose to do that?
[00:49:08.755 --> 00:49:13.177]  We called the Department of Children and Families to see what they've been doing to help.
[00:49:13.177 --> 00:49:20.200]  DCF says Hillsborough Kids Incorporated has been helping by paying Adam's rent, even providing her furniture.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.300]  Adam says it isn't enough.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:30.244]  Somebody needs to pay for all my children and my and Gary, all our suffering, all our pain.
[00:49:30.244 --> 00:49:34.325]  Somebody needs to be held accountable and they need to pay.
[00:49:34.325 --> 00:49:35.766]  I honestly
[00:49:39.275 --> 00:49:40.797]  I don't want to work.
[00:49:40.797 --> 00:49:41.998]  And I'm not going to.
[00:49:41.998 --> 00:49:43.860]  You can't force me.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.462]  I need my food stamps.
[00:49:45.462 --> 00:49:46.964]  I need them.
[00:49:46.964 --> 00:49:47.184]  Okay?
[00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:48.185]  This is not a joke.
[00:49:49.335 --> 00:49:50.616]  Just give me my food stamps.
[00:49:50.616 --> 00:49:52.317]  That's all I'm asking for.
[00:49:52.317 --> 00:50:01.444]  They are not incapacitated in any way or they, you know, they don't have a mental or physical disability that's documented and or could be observable.
[00:50:01.444 --> 00:50:09.469]  More counties will join them as federal exemptions to the requirements expire now that unemployment is below 10% for each affected county.
[00:50:09.469 --> 00:50:12.271]  I felt really bad about being on food stamps for a while.
[00:50:12.271 --> 00:50:17.715]  They're just for people who really, really need it, I thought, and I'm like living this flippant lifestyle in San Francisco.
[00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:18.876]  Do you think you really, really need it?
[00:50:19.156 --> 00:50:31.845]  Well, yeah, and eventually I just sort of realized that even though I'm 24, like, I still have responsibilities, I still have, like, hopes for my future, and if I need to be on food stamps to make that happen, then maybe I do really need it.
[00:50:31.845 --> 00:50:32.986]  Are you employed?
[00:50:32.986 --> 00:50:34.487]  No.
[00:50:34.487 --> 00:50:36.248]  How do you feel about that?
[00:50:36.248 --> 00:50:44.053]  I'm comfortable with it, and I feel like I don't need to look for one because I get a check from the government every month.
[00:50:44.053 --> 00:50:46.875]  Do you feel guilty about using your food stamp card when you have $850,000 in the bank?
[00:50:50.149 --> 00:50:51.949]  No.
[00:50:51.949 --> 00:50:53.890]  No, I don't.
[00:50:53.890 --> 00:51:02.111]  I'm going by the rules, and if they need to change their rules, they can change their rules, but I don't see I'm doing anything wrong.
[00:51:02.111 --> 00:51:04.592]  How much do you collect in benefits?
[00:51:04.592 --> 00:51:11.013]  I give $7.80 in food stamps, $500 in tannins, and I get Medicaid and WIC.
[00:51:11.013 --> 00:51:13.994]  Give me my food stamps.
[00:51:23.888 --> 00:51:31.870]  Now, for hundreds of years, once Rome became an empire, they controlled people in the city, which was the political control of the whole empire, with free handouts.
[00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:35.791]  And they penalized people that basically produced who were in the middle class.
[00:51:35.791 --> 00:51:42.453]  You had the ultra-rich patricians, and you had all the poor people down below that were citizens and then slaves beneath that.
[00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:47.251]  The same thing is repeating by design.
[00:51:47.251 --> 00:51:54.093]  We have the LBJ letters, all of it, when he's president, saying we're going to domesticate these people and have these n-words, vote in Democrat, for the next hundred years.
[00:51:54.093 --> 00:51:56.934]  And it is a program against everybody.
[00:51:56.934 --> 00:52:02.376]  They were particularly successful black folks, because they had been downtrodden before, but had their own communities, were somewhat successful.
[00:52:02.376 --> 00:52:04.276]  And then it was like, oh, you're going to help me actually?
[00:52:04.276 --> 00:52:05.636]  Here, yeah, get the father out of the home.
[00:52:05.636 --> 00:52:06.617]  Here's some money.
[00:52:06.617 --> 00:52:07.297]  We're going to do this.
[00:52:10.404 --> 00:52:15.746]  And then it creates just that same spoiled, rotten behavior, not gonna make me work, whatever.
[00:52:15.746 --> 00:52:30.352]  But you're gonna go vote for policies that raise taxes on the middle class, where all these liberals go and vote for big tax increases, but suddenly the IRS claims they're behind on subject technicality, and then an old lady has her house taken and she commits suicide.
[00:52:30.352 --> 00:52:31.673]  And we see these stories all the time.
[00:52:31.673 --> 00:52:33.994]  See, they're taking people's businesses and houses
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:43.442]  Because they're producing, and then they claim you didn't pay, or they fall on hard times, they get behind, or there's all this IRS fraud against people.
[00:52:43.442 --> 00:52:44.603]  It's been documented.
[00:52:44.603 --> 00:52:53.025]  Like the old Hispanic lady that had like an eight-top little counter deal for 40-something years, and she always deposited the cash every day, like 600, 700 bucks, at the bank.
[00:52:53.025 --> 00:52:53.805]  It was all registered.
[00:52:53.805 --> 00:52:58.887]  But they said, well, we say that's structuring, and so you're manipulating.
[00:52:58.887 --> 00:52:59.607]  We're going to take your
[00:53:00.694 --> 00:53:03.258]  Was it 80-something thousand dollars she'd save for her retirement?
[00:53:03.258 --> 00:53:05.962]  She was gonna pay for herself, but see, they took it away!
[00:53:05.962 --> 00:53:08.445]  And they said, oh, it's legal, we have a law, we can do it.
[00:53:08.445 --> 00:53:11.290]  You've paid your taxes, but it's illegal to make under...
[00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.889]  I honestly...
[00:53:42.742 --> 00:53:44.303]  I don't want to work.
[00:53:44.303 --> 00:53:45.484]  And I'm not going to.
[00:53:45.484 --> 00:53:47.565]  You can't force me.
[00:53:47.565 --> 00:53:53.329]  I need my... Now notice, she's totally entitled, like a lady that has 12, 14 kids, whatever it was.
[00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:54.910]  And she goes, look at all these kids!
[00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:56.731]  Somebody's got to take care of them.
[00:53:56.731 --> 00:53:58.653]  It's totally lost on her.
[00:53:58.653 --> 00:54:00.274]  But this was done to destroy her.
[00:54:00.274 --> 00:54:04.477]  I bet her grandmother was a slickly dressed, hardworking lady.
[00:54:04.477 --> 00:54:06.778]  Didn't have a lot of money, but had a lot of dignity.
[00:54:06.778 --> 00:54:09.100]  And looked like an executive today.
[00:54:10.117 --> 00:54:15.942]  And then she's a total rundown, just out of her mind slob, saying somebody take care of my kids.
[00:54:15.942 --> 00:54:17.723]  And you don't think it's real, do you understand?
[00:54:17.723 --> 00:54:22.627]  That's what it's produced, and now 47% of the population are more.
[00:54:22.627 --> 00:54:26.890]  It's almost 50 is like this, like Mitt Romney said, and the globalists know what they're doing.
[00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:33.716]  It's a demographic battle of total domesticated slaves that don't know how to do anything or take care of themselves.
[00:54:33.716 --> 00:54:34.396]  You see what it does?
[00:54:34.396 --> 00:54:34.857]  It parks.
[00:54:34.857 --> 00:54:38.240]  They say don't feed the wildlife because it makes them obese, lazy, and stupid.
[00:54:38.868 --> 00:54:41.088]  Well, don't feed the humans.
[00:54:41.088 --> 00:54:44.909]  Because, sure, if you break your back, fall off a roof, get cancer, take care of people.
[00:54:44.909 --> 00:54:45.769]  That's what welfare's for.
[00:54:45.769 --> 00:54:47.590]  But not, here, you don't do anything ever again!
[00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:57.351]  And look, there's a black guy here, Congressman Mr. Scott, and he's getting hundreds of billions of investment in black areas, and the black leaders are freaking out, because they don't want that.
[00:54:57.351 --> 00:55:02.232]  They want to sit on top of people they control, with the Democratic Party, and not see people empowered.
[00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:05.653]  They're scared to death, because if you can free the black people, you can free everybody.
[00:55:07.264 --> 00:55:10.606]  The blacks are their target, the group they already have control of.
[00:55:10.606 --> 00:55:14.808]  Everything you see done to them is a beta test for everybody else.
[00:55:14.808 --> 00:55:17.149]  Here's a clip of CNN's John King.
[00:55:17.149 --> 00:55:18.030]  How long will he be there?
[00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.930]  How long will he have a job?
[00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.811]  Is he going to get fired for telling the truth?
[00:55:20.811 --> 00:55:22.272]  He says, it's a real gamble though.
[00:55:22.272 --> 00:55:24.373]  Will Americans want more money and run their own lives?
[00:55:24.373 --> 00:55:25.874]  Will they want to go to a factory?
[00:55:25.874 --> 00:55:28.676]  Will they want to go work at a job and get paid $30 an hour?
[00:55:28.676 --> 00:55:32.098]  Or will they want to sit there and get $10 an hour sitting on their butt watching Jerry Springer?
[00:55:32.098 --> 00:55:32.418]  Here it is.
[00:55:33.218 --> 00:55:35.159]  As you watch this, the Republicans are making a big bet.
[00:55:35.159 --> 00:55:36.639]  They're taking a big risk.
[00:55:36.639 --> 00:55:40.460]  Will, over time, the American people say, oh, actually, I like having more money in my pocket.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.640]  Oh, they did hire more people at the factory down the street.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.761]  That's their big bet.
[00:55:43.761 --> 00:55:48.362]  Not one Democrat has voted for a bill that cuts taxes by $1.5 trillion.
[00:55:48.362 --> 00:55:52.903]  To Abby's point, if you're a working class family, a lot of people say, oh, it's only $200.
[00:55:52.903 --> 00:55:53.723]  Oh, it's only $300.
[00:55:53.723 --> 00:56:00.765]  If you're a working class family living paycheck to paycheck, $200, $300 is damn good money, and you are grateful for it.
[00:56:00.765 --> 00:56:01.505]  Are the Democrats?
[00:56:02.253 --> 00:56:05.134]  That's the lowest level of people that are at the poverty line.
[00:56:05.134 --> 00:56:05.815]  Trump wanted it gone.
[00:56:05.815 --> 00:56:08.056]  But we're talking middle class, $2,000, $4,000, $5,000 a year of the tax credits for kids.
[00:56:08.056 --> 00:56:08.816]  Now you're up to $8,000, $10,000.
[00:56:08.816 --> 00:56:10.277]  Add all together, somebody making $60,000, $70,000 a year.
[00:56:26.505 --> 00:56:29.948]  Is now going to be paying like $5,000, $6,000 instead of $20,000.
[00:56:29.948 --> 00:56:32.090]  I mean, I was looking at the numbers.
[00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:33.412]  This is huge.
[00:56:33.412 --> 00:56:35.434]  And it isn't the tax cut that's so good.
[00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:39.998]  It's that it creates jobs and then gets the ball rolling.
[00:56:39.998 --> 00:56:41.159]  Just like you've done.
[00:56:41.159 --> 00:56:42.280]  We're not government finance.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.281]  We're not corporate finance.
[00:56:43.281 --> 00:56:44.282]  We don't have corporate sponsors.
[00:56:44.282 --> 00:56:46.984]  We have you buying good products that we want you to love.
[00:56:46.984 --> 00:56:48.226]  Some of the best out there.

[00:57:06.449 --> 00:57:12.494]  MycoZX has been sold out for six months, and I guess a truck came out of it finally from Dr. Gribb on Monday.
[00:57:13.254 --> 00:57:14.535]  He goes, hey, Michael ZX is back.
[00:57:14.535 --> 00:57:15.155]  Weren't you promoting?
[00:57:15.155 --> 00:57:19.937]  I said I didn't come in and I checked with the warehouse a few miles off and guess what?
[00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:22.038]  It's all there, but a limited supply.
[00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:23.099]  Only a few thousand bottles.
[00:57:23.099 --> 00:57:29.802]  So if you want your Michael ZX 20% discount, it's got a 100% wood reorder, 4.8 star reviews.

[00:57:40.387 --> 00:57:43.648]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:57:43.648 --> 00:57:47.969]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but
[00:58:03.553 --> 00:58:11.140]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:17.526]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:58:17.526 --> 00:58:18.827]  These are all parasites.
[00:58:18.827 --> 00:58:19.928]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[00:58:19.928 --> 00:58:20.989]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:58:21.269 --> 00:58:25.752]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:58:25.752 --> 00:58:29.035]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:58:29.035 --> 00:58:32.097]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:58:32.097 --> 00:58:33.158]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:58:33.158 --> 00:58:35.079]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:35.079 --> 00:58:36.100]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:38.802]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:58:38.802 --> 00:58:42.084]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:42.084 --> 00:58:44.325]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:58:44.325 --> 00:58:46.287]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:52.431]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[00:58:52.431 --> 00:59:07.033]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:59:07.033 --> 00:59:14.575]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[00:59:14.855 --> 00:59:15.135]  Thank you.
[00:59:15.135 --> 00:59:20.058]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[00:59:20.058 --> 00:59:23.019]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[00:59:23.019 --> 00:59:26.301]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:32.444]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[00:59:32.444 --> 00:59:34.966]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[00:59:35.706 --> 00:59:42.548]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:59:42.548 --> 00:59:51.410]  That is the new shirt of the month, available exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:54.031]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.255 --> 01:00:19.357]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:19.357 --> 01:00:24.639]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.639 --> 01:00:29.220]  I've even had media go, how do you like it now that the liberals are calling themselves the resistance?
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.321]  Does that confuse people?
[01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:31.381]  No, we're the resistance.
[01:00:32.964 --> 01:00:34.685]  We're taking back the planet.
[01:00:34.685 --> 01:00:36.466]  And we're always going to be resisting evil.
[01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.747]  In ourselves!
[01:00:38.747 --> 01:00:39.768]  It's an ongoing battle.
[01:00:39.768 --> 01:00:40.468]  It never ends.
[01:00:40.468 --> 01:00:44.410]  It's the great animating contest of liberty.
[01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:46.571]  Our perfection is our imperfection.
[01:00:46.571 --> 01:00:49.813]  But knowing God's perfection, we can see into perfection.
[01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:54.576]  And seeing perfection, we can know it, and worship it, and be part of it.
[01:00:54.576 --> 01:00:57.777]  But through us, God can experience imperfection.
[01:00:57.777 --> 01:00:58.698]  Hence, we were created.
[01:00:59.617 --> 01:01:05.439]  Expressions of God's mind, but autonomous, individuals, free, not robots.
[01:01:05.439 --> 01:01:17.002]  Sentient, conscious, sharing the mind of God, but in a tiny, microscopic way, but still beautiful like the rays of the sun through crystal, projected on the wall.
[01:01:17.002 --> 01:01:20.603]  Not the sun, but beautiful.
[01:01:20.603 --> 01:01:22.104]  Not the sun, but part of the sun.
[01:01:25.885 --> 01:01:31.068]  And before the media says I'm sun-worshipping, it's an allegory to the mind of God.
[01:01:31.068 --> 01:01:43.436]  Now, let's play a few minutes of Trump announcing the victory that we should be celebrating greatly, because prosperity to Democrats, Communists, globalists, dirtbags, parasites,
[01:01:44.591 --> 01:01:53.338]  Ernie Sanders, scam artist like him, rich, filthy, five, six houses, you know, hundred thousand dollar car, never worked in his life, big flim flammer at the college, big scam artist.
[01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:55.620]  It's like high noon to Count Dracula.
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.042]  So here it is.
[01:01:58.042 --> 01:02:03.767]  In 34 years, but actually really hasn't been done because we broke every record.
[01:02:03.767 --> 01:02:13.155]  It's the largest, I always say the most massive, but it's the largest tax cut in the history of our country and reform, but tax cut.
[01:02:14.255 --> 01:02:17.577]  Really something special.
[01:02:17.577 --> 01:02:20.239]  And I noticed this just came out two minutes ago.
[01:02:20.239 --> 01:02:21.880]  They handed it to me.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.361]  AT&T plans to increase U.S.
[01:02:24.361 --> 01:02:32.266]  capital spending $1 billion and provide $1,000 special bonus to more than 200,000 U.S.
[01:02:32.266 --> 01:02:32.806]  employees.
[01:02:32.806 --> 01:02:36.849]  And that's because... By the way, dozens of companies have now announced similar things.
[01:02:36.849 --> 01:02:37.629]  That's pretty good.
[01:02:41.528 --> 01:02:53.110]  I have a whole list of accomplishments that the group behind me have done in terms of this administration and this Congress, but you've heard it before.
[01:02:53.110 --> 01:03:09.614]  Records all over the place, and that will continue and then some because of what we did, but $3.2 trillion, just think of it, in tax cuts for American families, including doubling the standard deduction and doubling the child tax credit.
[01:03:10.868 --> 01:03:16.534]  The typical family of four earning $75,000 will see an income tax cut of more than $2,000.
[01:03:16.534 --> 01:03:19.257]  They're going to have $2,000.
[01:03:19.257 --> 01:03:22.460]  And that's, in my opinion, going to be less than the average.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.762]  You're going to have a lot more than that.
[01:03:26.062 --> 01:03:36.068]  One thing very important for the farmers, the great farmers and the great small business owners that were forced to sell their businesses at bargain basement numbers.
[01:03:36.068 --> 01:03:45.213]  We have provided for the most part estate taxes wiped out so they can keep their farms in the family and that to me is a very big factor.
[01:03:45.213 --> 01:03:45.693]  Very big.
[01:03:47.563 --> 01:03:49.386]  I can't afford a family farm.
[01:03:49.386 --> 01:03:52.230]  This is going to mean companies are going to be coming back.
[01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:56.095]  You know, I campaigned on the fact that we're not going to lose our companies anymore.
[01:03:56.095 --> 01:03:58.538]  They're going to stay in our country.
[01:03:58.538 --> 01:04:00.000]  And they're going to stay in our country.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.764]  And you've been seeing what's been happening even at this prospect.
[01:04:03.765 --> 01:04:04.306]  Stop right there.
[01:04:04.306 --> 01:04:06.006]  I'm going to come back with more of the President after the break.
[01:04:06.006 --> 01:04:07.087]  We have a guest joining us.
[01:04:07.087 --> 01:04:08.668]  Let's back it up a little bit.
[01:04:08.668 --> 01:04:09.388]  You know, that's the thing.
[01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:15.371]  My dad, we have an old farm slash ranch, and more and more of it gets sold just to keep the little pieces we've got.
[01:04:15.371 --> 01:04:23.355]  And then the way they've got it set up, you run cattle, do stuff just to pay the taxes, and then everybody has to have a couple other jobs on the side.
[01:04:23.355 --> 01:04:28.958]  And this has all been actuaried in by the big companies.
[01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:32.700]  And there's only one group, only one group that
[01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:38.857]  That's higher levels of suicide than our veterans, and that's US farmers.
[01:04:38.857 --> 01:04:44.022]  We were so close to total shutdown and we're still in deep trouble, but we're fighting back.
[01:04:44.022 --> 01:04:45.184]  We're conscious now.
[01:04:45.184 --> 01:04:48.767]  We've been stabbed quite a bit, but our heart's still pumping.
[01:04:48.767 --> 01:04:49.708]  We're gonna make it.
[01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:50.850]  I know we are.
[01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:52.732]  We're gonna crush these people when they know it.

[01:05:40.725 --> 01:05:41.385]  Big Brother.
[01:05:41.385 --> 01:05:42.066]  Mainstream media.
[01:05:42.066 --> 01:05:42.806]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:11.485 --> 01:06:13.427]  You want answers?
[01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:15.308]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:15.308 --> 01:06:21.713]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:26.101 --> 01:06:35.504]  It's important for the farmers, the great farmers and the great small business owners that were forced to sell their businesses at bargain basement numbers.
[01:06:35.504 --> 01:06:44.627]  We have provided for the most part estate taxes wiped out so they can keep their farms in the family and that to me is a very big factor.
[01:06:44.627 --> 01:06:45.107]  Very big.
[01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:51.652]  This is going to mean companies are going to be coming back.
[01:06:51.652 --> 01:06:55.514]  You know, I campaigned on the fact that we're not going to lose our companies anymore.
[01:06:55.514 --> 01:06:57.956]  They're going to stay in our country.
[01:06:57.956 --> 01:06:59.417]  And they're going to stay in our country.
[01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:02.179]  And you've been seeing what's been happening even at this prospect.
[01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:14.834]  But they have tremendous enthusiasm right now in this country, and we have companies pouring back into our country, and that means jobs, and it means really the formation of new, young, beautiful, strong companies.
[01:07:14.834 --> 01:07:17.557]  So that's going to be very, very important.
[01:07:17.557 --> 01:07:21.862]  The pass-throughs you know all about, and the small businesses are going to be big beneficiaries.
[01:07:22.463 --> 01:07:26.704]  We are going to bring at least four trillion dollars back into this country.
[01:07:26.704 --> 01:07:32.506]  Money that was frozen overseas and in parts and worlds and some of them don't even like us.
[01:07:32.506 --> 01:07:33.346]  And they had the money.
[01:07:33.346 --> 01:07:35.667]  Well, they're not going to have the money long.
[01:07:35.667 --> 01:07:48.851]  And so it's really I guess it's very simple when you think you haven't heard this expression, but we are making America great again.
[01:07:48.851 --> 01:07:49.891]  You haven't heard that, have you?
[01:07:54.430 --> 01:08:01.795]  I want to have them get up and get the glamour and the glory, and I just want to have a few of them come up, and they'll speak for a little while, short.
[01:08:01.795 --> 01:08:03.015]  The shorter, the better.
[01:08:03.015 --> 01:08:05.037]  That way we can get all of you.
[01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:07.298]  We'll get everybody up, right?
[01:08:07.298 --> 01:08:10.460]  But I want to thank Mitch McConnell.
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:13.121]  I want to thank... What a job.
[01:08:13.121 --> 01:08:13.782]  What a job.
[01:08:15.077 --> 01:08:16.218]  And I want to thank Paul.
[01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:16.919]  They're going to speak.
[01:08:16.919 --> 01:08:18.300]  They're going to say a few words.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:21.504]  But Paul Ryan and Mitch, it was a little team.
[01:08:21.504 --> 01:08:23.105]  We just got together and we would...
[01:08:23.945 --> 01:08:25.867]  Worked very hard, didn't we, huh?
[01:08:25.867 --> 01:08:28.008]  It seems like it was a lot of fun.
[01:08:28.008 --> 01:08:29.409]  It's always a lot of fun when you win.
[01:08:29.409 --> 01:08:32.632]  If you work hard and lose, that's not acceptable.
[01:08:32.632 --> 01:08:36.715]  But I'm just going to name a few names and then some... All right, folks, we are back live.
[01:08:36.715 --> 01:08:38.917]  Just more of the big historic victory.
[01:08:38.917 --> 01:08:41.919]  And I cannot stress upon everybody enough.
[01:08:41.919 --> 01:08:44.521]  I know you know this, but your friends and family may not.
[01:08:44.521 --> 01:08:51.147]  The globalists admit in the WikiLeaks and many other documents, many other statements that they've made, that they are openly
[01:08:52.165 --> 01:08:57.331]  Trying to demoralize the West, demoralize free market, demoralize renaissance.
[01:08:57.331 --> 01:09:01.617]  And this tax bill is far from perfect, but it's the biggest in modern history.
[01:09:01.617 --> 01:09:06.182]  It's as big as Kennedy tax cuts that, by the way, doubled tax receipts in one year.
[01:09:06.182 --> 01:09:07.704]  And you ask, well, why don't Democrats want that?
[01:09:07.704 --> 01:09:09.146]  They want control, and they admit it.
[01:09:11.638 --> 01:09:13.140]  This is a big victory.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.202]  The worm is turning, in my view.
[01:09:15.202 --> 01:09:25.112]  It'll be so hard for the nasty Mueller and his whole fake thing to try to bring Trump down now, even with the Christmas indictment of Kushner that was supposedly going to happen a few days before.
[01:09:25.112 --> 01:09:26.013]  We have that on good sources.
[01:09:26.013 --> 01:09:27.334]  They may back off on that now.
[01:09:27.334 --> 01:09:31.438]  Mueller's saying maybe a year out, hoping you forget about the criminality of their investigation.
[01:09:31.438 --> 01:09:32.659]  Now the EU's come out and said,
[01:09:33.516 --> 01:09:35.297]  This is going to flood jobs back in the U.S.
[01:09:35.297 --> 01:09:38.580]  You're supposed to match taxes with us under these secret agreements.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:42.443]  I mean, that's in the Associated Press, that we're breaking global government rules.
[01:09:42.443 --> 01:09:43.464]  Yeah!
[01:09:43.464 --> 01:09:44.705]  That screwed us over!
[01:09:44.705 --> 01:09:49.048]  I mean, we might have got sucked into your old government, it was some great deal, then later you could have took over.
[01:09:49.048 --> 01:09:51.230]  But you made it a screw job from the beginning.
[01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:53.632]  You won't even tell us who runs the TPP and all this.
[01:09:53.632 --> 01:09:55.213]  Oh, Trump killed that too.
[01:09:55.213 --> 01:09:59.537]  So, I could be critical of Trump on quite a few things, but frankly, I couldn't do what he's done.
[01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:22.751]  And the global movement that all of you are leading, that Matt Drudge is leading, I mean I can't thank everybody in the independent real press, but now having talk show host John King on CNN say this is a great deal for people, this is really historic, 1.5 trillion, cutting way back the estate tax, bringing back the corporate money, this is a big deal and I couldn't think of a better person
[01:10:23.991 --> 01:10:42.918]  In the aftermath of this victory, the consummate libertarian, talk show host, expert, businessman, father, patriot, Stefan Molyneux, needs no introduction, YouTube, forward slash, Free Domain Radio, Twitter, Stefan Molyneux, freedomainradio.com, you can get his book, The Art of the Argument, it's excellent by the way.
[01:10:42.918 --> 01:10:51.981]  So he joins us now to give us his look at this and how he thinks they're going to counter-strike, or maybe he disagrees, maybe this isn't that huge of a victory.
[01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:53.542]  Stefan Molyneux, thanks for coming on with us, sir.
[01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:55.543]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:56.205]  Great to be here.
[01:10:56.205 --> 01:10:59.793]  Merry Christmas to you, your family, and your great listenership.
[01:10:59.793 --> 01:11:01.337]  I really appreciate the time to chat today.
[01:11:01.337 --> 01:11:01.859]  Back at ya!
[01:11:03.397 --> 01:11:04.457]  It is a great victory.
[01:11:04.457 --> 01:11:06.958]  It is a great victory because it does a whole number of things.
[01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:12.099]  Number one, it puts money back into the hands of the American worker, which of course is a great thing.
[01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:13.540]  You get to keep more of your own money.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:16.980]  And some of that is direct in terms of the tax cuts themselves.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:24.582]  But another is that by lowering corporate tax rates, corporations have more money to invest in upgrades, to pay their workers more.
[01:11:24.582 --> 01:11:27.143]  So it is a wonderful Christmas present for the American worker.
[01:11:27.523 --> 01:11:28.544]  That's a great thing.
[01:11:28.544 --> 01:11:34.029]  The other great thing is it reveals the Democrat Party to be basically a combination of the Grinch and a Bond villain.
[01:11:34.029 --> 01:11:35.951]  I mean, it's weird when you think about it.
[01:11:35.951 --> 01:11:36.552]  Oh no!
[01:11:36.552 --> 01:11:40.175]  American workers are getting more money around Christmas time!
[01:11:40.175 --> 01:11:42.077]  That's the worst thing in the world!
[01:11:42.077 --> 01:11:46.241]  And it's like, what terrible optics are they working with that they oppose this?
[01:11:47.201 --> 01:11:48.242]  Exactly.
[01:11:48.242 --> 01:11:54.447]  34 years since we've had a real tax cut for the middle class and workers while we've been de-industrialized, which they admit is a plan.
[01:11:54.447 --> 01:11:56.309]  I mean, why do you think the EU is so dumb?
[01:11:56.309 --> 01:11:59.071]  They're openly bitching, saying, you're going to get the jobs now.
[01:12:00.379 --> 01:12:09.525]  Well, of course the EU doesn't want to have to restrain their own socialist spending, so of course they would love a deal where everyone keeps their corporate tax rates high and keeps their tax rates high.
[01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:19.732]  The EU is also being revealed this season as well for sanctioning, working on massive sanctions against Poland, while paying billions of euros to Turkey, of all places.
[01:12:19.732 --> 01:12:28.398]  Poland, that the West fought to try and free and failed in the Second World War, who fought valiantly against both Nazism and Communism, are being sanctioned.
[01:12:28.838 --> 01:12:32.700]  While Turkey, of all places, is being rewarded with billions of Euros.
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.701]  I'm glad you raised that.
[01:12:33.701 --> 01:12:37.182]  They're threatening Poland and others with billions in fines.
[01:12:37.182 --> 01:12:38.323]  100,000 Euros.
[01:12:38.323 --> 01:12:39.523]  Explain that to people.
[01:12:39.523 --> 01:12:41.905]  Per illegal that's come in.
[01:12:41.905 --> 01:12:42.925]  Military age men.
[01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:44.266]  The raping, the killing.
[01:12:44.266 --> 01:12:45.126]  Going on the welfare.
[01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:48.528]  They're giving them, throwing pensioners out of their Section 8 housing.
[01:12:48.528 --> 01:12:49.128]  Putting them in.
[01:12:49.128 --> 01:12:50.309]  I mean, this is a crazy plan.
[01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:57.072]  Well, of course, they hate the fact that Poland is a Christian nation.
[01:12:57.072 --> 01:13:14.499]  They hate the fact that Poland is a proud nation, and they hate the fact that Polish people, having been subjugated and controlled for a significant portion of their history, either as Poland or the pre-Poland countries, subjugated by Islam, subjugated by communism, the fact that they fought so hard
[01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:16.312]  To be free.
[01:13:16.312 --> 01:13:23.140]  That they value and treasure their freedom and are willing to stand up against the corrupt tyranny of the EU is something that simply cannot be allowed to stand.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:31.169]  I mean, Turkey is working nicely with the EU, but Poland wishes to remain a sovereign country and to resist mass immigration from the third world.
[01:13:31.169 --> 01:13:32.431]  And so naturally, of course!
[01:13:33.348 --> 01:13:35.350]  They are fighting it tooth and nail.
[01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:37.954]  And they also don't want the example.
[01:13:37.954 --> 01:13:41.438]  You know, one prisoner walks through a fence that everyone thinks is locked.
[01:13:41.438 --> 01:13:43.120]  The other prisoner's not getting ideas.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.063]  They can't have one example of a country with borders.
[01:13:46.063 --> 01:13:49.107]  They can't have one example of a country with an in-group preference.
[01:13:49.107 --> 01:13:53.452]  And they sure as hell can't have a country where Christianity stands against foreign religions.
[01:13:56.226 --> 01:14:04.456]  What I'm concerned about, though, is the wild-eyed insanity of Stefan Molyneux, where they've gone from laughing at me and yelling at me in the street to, like, trying to attack me now.
[01:14:04.456 --> 01:14:06.279]  They're getting more and more desperate.
[01:14:06.279 --> 01:14:14.009]  And Rosie O'Donnell trying to make bribes on Twitter, saying I'm serious, a million dollars, two million for senators that vote against it.
[01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:17.594]  And like saying, let's go kill congressmen.
[01:14:17.594 --> 01:14:21.461]  I mean, they're going into complete insane asylum land.
[01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:23.604]  And I'm not scared of them, like they're going to beat us.
[01:14:23.604 --> 01:14:25.768]  I'm just worried about their mental illness.
[01:14:25.768 --> 01:14:27.330]  I mean, clearly, what is wrong with them?
[01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:35.364]  They are addicted to power and they are representing an entire community.
[01:14:35.364 --> 01:14:44.513]  In America, this is tens, possibly even a hundred million or more people who probably feel genuinely having been dependent on the state for generations.
[01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:47.697]  And I'm not just talking about the poor, we're also talking about the military-industrial complex.
[01:14:48.377 --> 01:15:01.066]  And all the people who benefit from the state's awesome power to create and redistribute trillions of dollars in the economy, that has created a market of people dependent upon state power, dependent upon the coercive nature of the state apparatus.
[01:15:01.066 --> 01:15:11.873]  And when someone like Donald Trump comes along and says, we're going to make the state smaller, we're going to put more people in the free market, we're going to put more people in the tax paying private sector and out of the government dependent public sector,
[01:15:12.473 --> 01:15:17.596]  They panic and they freak out because they view the government as the sole source of their survival.
[01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:22.359]  They do not, they no longer have the self-esteem to believe that they can survive without welfare.
[01:15:22.359 --> 01:15:23.700]  Exactly, we've got to go to break.
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:25.781]  Stefan Mullin, who stayed right there, because I want to talk about this.
[01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:32.365]  Because literally, they're the ones that have always been robbing us and feeding on us and trying to dumb us down to be better servants, you know, domesticate us.
[01:15:32.365 --> 01:15:37.849]  And then we're finally struggling back because, you know, half our wealth isn't enough for them and they think we're killing them.
[01:15:38.089 --> 01:15:39.871]  Because they act like we're killing them!
[01:15:39.871 --> 01:15:41.913]  Meanwhile, we're bringing all this wealth back and going to help them.
[01:15:41.913 --> 01:15:43.394]  That's what created all the wealth, idiots!
[01:15:43.394 --> 01:15:45.116]  It was a little bit of free market.
[01:15:45.116 --> 01:15:48.679]  We just get out of the way and let the adults give you freedom.
[01:15:48.679 --> 01:15:50.041]  My God, you morons!
[01:15:50.041 --> 01:15:53.044]  But see, they crave the power to control people.
[01:15:53.044 --> 01:15:54.665]  It's worse than just dependency.
[01:15:55.982 --> 01:16:02.744]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:16:02.744 --> 01:16:07.005]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[01:16:07.005 --> 01:16:11.626]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.
[01:16:11.626 --> 01:16:17.187]  For incredibly delicious water now and in an emergency, get to GoBerkey.com or call 877-886-3653.

[01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:17.667]  GoBerkey.com

[01:18:07.065 --> 01:18:15.127]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.

[01:18:58.545 --> 01:18:59.805]  Go ahead.
[01:18:59.805 --> 01:19:01.726]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:19:01.726 --> 01:19:11.051]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:19:11.907 --> 01:19:18.673]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:19:18.673 --> 01:19:20.935]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:19:20.935 --> 01:19:21.996]  Thank you.
[01:19:21.996 --> 01:19:24.498]  I use the BioTruth Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:19:24.498 --> 01:19:28.802]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:19:28.802 --> 01:19:31.844]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:19:31.844 --> 01:19:33.146]  They are quality.
[01:19:33.146 --> 01:19:34.887]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:19:34.887 --> 01:19:37.769]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:19:37.769 --> 01:19:38.310]  Absolutely.
[01:19:38.810 --> 01:20:00.479]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:20:00.479 --> 01:20:03.120]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:08.405 --> 01:20:11.006]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:17.209]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.665 --> 01:20:26.866]  Stefan Molyneux is our guest.
[01:20:26.866 --> 01:20:30.187]  He's riding shotgun with us in the hour.
[01:20:30.187 --> 01:20:37.510]  We have the former board member of the Davos Group, or the head of the Aspen Group, you name it, Ted Malik joining us again.
[01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:41.972]  He's finally ready to talk about Luciferianism and Satanism in the elite.
[01:20:43.742 --> 01:20:51.774]  He himself has degrees, not just in economics and the rest of it, but also in theology and in the study of religions.
[01:20:51.774 --> 01:20:54.819]  And it's rampant in the globalists.
[01:20:54.819 --> 01:20:58.544]  But again, whether you believe the devil or not, it's an operating system, a spirit, an attitude.
[01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:05.760]  Like pirates catch their hair on fire and have skull and crossbones saying, if you don't give up, we'll kill you.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.022]  There's blood dripping out of the skull and a flag that means we'll kill you anyways.
[01:21:09.022 --> 01:21:15.606]  So it's kind of an idea of we're going to hurt everybody, we're going to steal from everybody, we're going to invert reality, we're going to be corrupt.
[01:21:15.606 --> 01:21:24.751]  And anybody who isn't into that, you finally run into people that are like that and you're just blown away that they get off on blowing systems up, controlling people, dumbing people down, they get off on it.
[01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:31.559]  And free market is a system that allows you to make choices through the market.
[01:21:31.559 --> 01:21:36.021]  And generally the will of the people in a real market is the best system.
[01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:41.865]  But you see BuzzFeed editors saying, I want total communism for Christmas.
[01:21:43.928 --> 01:21:50.389]  Okay, so again, living here in a quasi-free system, much better than North Korea, they're making these statements.
[01:21:50.389 --> 01:21:58.471]  And Stefan also wanted to get into Christmas, because in my view, if you're able to say two plus two equals four, that's freedom, quoting George Orwell.
[01:21:58.471 --> 01:22:00.131]  Well, if you can say Christmas, it's freedom.
[01:22:00.131 --> 01:22:10.073]  And it sounds silly, but they really want to erase everything, whether it was perfect, or bad, or good, or indifferent, because they want to force you to accept their new system.
[01:22:10.073 --> 01:22:11.674]  So that's why they go after
[01:22:12.654 --> 01:22:14.116]  Christian culture particularly.
[01:22:14.116 --> 01:22:20.042]  I don't mean the fake churches and all the corrupt things that are involved with those, but I mean the actual idea of that.
[01:22:20.042 --> 01:22:24.006]  And then they make fun of, you know, and want to destroy it.
[01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:31.774]  So, Stefan Molyneux, why, you know, just as a researcher looking at like an anthropologist or sociologist, why do they want to attack Christmas?
[01:22:33.033 --> 01:22:36.535]  And why are they going after it so much in this culture war?
[01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:38.436]  And how are they doing in the culture war?
[01:22:38.436 --> 01:22:40.517]  That feeds back into what we hit at the break.
[01:22:40.517 --> 01:22:42.758]  What are they going to do as this all caves in?
[01:22:42.758 --> 01:22:58.545]  Most of them weren't even part of the power structure, but they were living through it, feeling like they were running things culturally, and were going to excoriate and control and re-educate those of us, liberal, conservative, libertarian, agnostic, that didn't fit into their little box.
[01:22:58.545 --> 01:23:00.246]  I mean, really, they're a cult of bullies.
[01:23:01.854 --> 01:23:18.671]  Well there are those, and this is I think very appropriate to Christmas time Alex, there are those in the world who want to do good, to be virtuous, and that is individual action, that is going to help the poor, that is going to bring food to people, is going to work in soup kitchens, it's going to speak to someone who's down and raise up their spirits.
[01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:25.295]  Or if you want workers to make more money, then it's about starting a business and hiring people and paying them well.
[01:23:25.295 --> 01:23:33.060]  Or if you want people to get free health care, then it's about donating to a hospital or a church or becoming a doctor and working pro bono from time to time.
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:37.224]  So there's individual action which gives you the satisfaction of having done good in the world.
[01:23:37.964 --> 01:23:43.549]  There's people who just want to feel good without actually expending the time, energy and resources to do good themselves.
[01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:51.935]  And those are the people who want to change the system or the structure or the state or the law in order to remove negative stimuli from them.
[01:23:51.935 --> 01:23:53.136]  Poor people, sick people.
[01:23:53.136 --> 01:23:55.958]  But they don't actually want to go out and do good individually.
[01:23:55.958 --> 01:23:56.779]  That's too much work.
[01:23:56.779 --> 01:24:02.003]  They want to get all of the benefits of doing good by advocating for a system that's usually coercive in nature.
[01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:06.327]  And thus, as literally is said, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[01:24:08.755 --> 01:24:09.856]  I've never heard it said better.
[01:24:09.856 --> 01:24:11.516]  I mean, that's it.
[01:24:11.516 --> 01:24:16.358]  So you pointed out the groups out there that just think, hey, I'm going to be thrown on the street and they don't know any better.
[01:24:16.358 --> 01:24:19.800]  And that's kind of the folks at the bottom of the room.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.481]  But in the last decade or so,
[01:24:23.968 --> 01:24:33.474]  More and more of that pyramidal structure actually thinks they're part of the elite and have been taught kind of the upper crust, anti-liberty, anti-human authoritarianism.
[01:24:33.474 --> 01:24:40.018]  And so the left, in its modern sense, has, I believe, converted to a crazy form of authoritarianism.
[01:24:40.018 --> 01:24:40.859]  Do you agree with that?
[01:24:40.859 --> 01:24:43.661]  And if so, why?
[01:24:43.661 --> 01:24:46.082]  I think it's the devil's temptation, right?
[01:24:46.082 --> 01:24:50.565]  The devil takes Jesus to a mountaintop in the desert and shows him the whole world.
[01:24:51.258 --> 01:24:53.762]  And says all of this can be yours if you follow me.
[01:24:53.762 --> 01:24:58.349]  And this Darwinian thirst for material power, for material resources.
[01:24:58.349 --> 01:25:01.254]  It's merely about gene reproduction for the most part.
[01:25:01.254 --> 01:25:04.979]  We are driven to seek resources to ensure the survival of our offspring.
[01:25:04.979 --> 01:25:05.941]  And if you take away
[01:25:06.613 --> 01:25:14.479]  Christian ethics or philosophical ethics or virtues that surmount and surpass and restrain the mere Nietzschean-Darwinian will for power.
[01:25:14.479 --> 01:25:14.900]  It's a government.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.301]  Will for control of resources.
[01:25:16.301 --> 01:25:17.362]  Society falls apart.
[01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:23.086]  Society is a common code of self-restraint and under Darwinism there is no self-restraint.
[01:25:23.086 --> 01:25:26.749]  You get as many resources by whatever means necessary as possible.
[01:25:26.749 --> 01:25:29.311]  You have just crystallized it and the globalists endorse that.
[01:25:29.311 --> 01:25:31.173]  They say we're social Darwinists.
[01:25:31.173 --> 01:25:32.354]  Explain what that means to people.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:40.241]  Well, social Darwinism to some degree is, I think, allowing for the state to favor particular groups.
[01:25:40.241 --> 01:25:55.805]  One of the things that's happened that's been really, really tragic is the growth of the single mom industry, so to speak, where you have this breakdown in marriage, you have easy divorces, you have alimony, you have child support, and you have the state stepping in for irresponsible women who have children.
[01:25:55.805 --> 01:25:57.225]  And then they lionize it.
[01:25:57.225 --> 01:25:59.626]  We're not attacking single women, but then they lionize it.
[01:25:59.626 --> 01:26:00.306]  They set it up.
[01:26:01.607 --> 01:26:06.233]  Well, it used to be the case, of course, that if you were a single mom, your parents would end up having to pay to raise your child.
[01:26:06.233 --> 01:26:11.979]  So your parents had a very strong incentive to restrain the wild, tsunami-like hormones of teenage sexuality.
[01:26:11.979 --> 01:26:21.791]  With the welfare state taking away the negative consequences of irresponsible sexuality, it's the old Chesterton quote, says, when you get rid of the big laws, you don't end up with no laws, you end up with an infinity of tiny laws.
[01:26:22.111 --> 01:26:29.538]  And now we have all of this crazy breakdown in sexual morality, which is causing massive amounts of predation and massive amounts of single motherhood.
[01:26:29.538 --> 01:26:38.466]  And so this is the welfare state takes resources from more responsible people and gives it to less responsible people, thus encouraging the reproduction of less responsible people.
[01:26:38.466 --> 01:26:43.190]  Personality is largely genetic and therefore you have social engineering, you have a kind of dysgenics.
[01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:45.292]  Well, exactly!
[01:26:45.292 --> 01:26:52.601]  The eugenicists claimed they were going to clean all that up, but instead they made it 50 times worse!
[01:26:53.939 --> 01:26:58.203]  Yeah, the government should not be involved in providing resources for reproduction.
[01:26:58.203 --> 01:27:00.585]  That is eugenics at a fundamental level.
[01:27:00.585 --> 01:27:12.855]  Whether you have eugenics on a race or class-based level is wrong to take resources from one group and give it to another group because it's fundamentally messing with the DNA of the species, usually to extraordinarily terrible effects.
[01:27:12.855 --> 01:27:13.615]  Well, we've seen that.
[01:27:13.615 --> 01:27:15.577]  I don't know if you've seen the compilation of videos.
[01:27:15.577 --> 01:27:16.318]  We might play it again.
[01:27:16.758 --> 01:27:19.940]  Where people go, I got 12 kids, somebody better take care of them.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:24.504]  It's not enough to get $10,000 a month in free housing and free furniture and everything.
[01:27:24.504 --> 01:27:27.866]  I'm going to sit here on my butt squirting kids out and you're going to pay for it.
[01:27:29.372 --> 01:27:37.975]  Oh, and it's terrible, and children, when children are an expense, society gets more responsible, because responsible people have to pay for those expenses.
[01:27:37.975 --> 01:27:39.935]  And women choose the best provider.
[01:27:39.935 --> 01:27:46.217]  In a free market, the best provider tends to be the smartest, the most resourceful, the most intelligent, the most wise, the most mature.
[01:27:46.217 --> 01:27:52.419]  And so you end up with a positive eugenics in the free market, where smarter people end up with more resources, more kids, and so on.
[01:27:52.419 --> 01:27:54.600]  Free market is the only humane, true eugenics!
[01:27:55.589 --> 01:28:13.983]  It is absolutely and when you end up with the system where children become an asset rather than a liability then what happens is people have children in order to make money and that means they don't have to have anybody responsible sticking around and of course the whole welfare state thing where they say you only get welfare if there's no man in the house.
[01:28:13.983 --> 01:28:16.825]  They are paying women to have children and keep
[01:28:17.535 --> 01:28:19.856]  Fatherhood at bay to keep fathers away.
[01:28:19.856 --> 01:28:22.296]  And Stefan, I've got to go to Brightwell and come back and I've got to ask you.
[01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:27.058]  They admit they're doing it by design just to have control, but don't they see what it ends up in?
[01:28:27.058 --> 01:28:28.638]  It literally ends in idiocracy.
[01:28:28.638 --> 01:28:31.359]  And idiocracy isn't coming in 300 years.
[01:28:31.359 --> 01:28:32.139]  We're here.
[01:28:32.139 --> 01:28:34.200]  Stefan Molyneux, Free Domain Radio.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.200]  What an amazing guy.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.781]  We're getting the new studios and stuff built, getting more crew hired.
[01:28:37.781 --> 01:28:41.682]  I've been talking to him very soon, trying to get him to work with us daily hopefully, but he's a busy guy.
[01:28:42.122 --> 01:28:45.750]  Not a guy smarter out there than Stevon Mullin, and we're really blessed to have him with us.
[01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:48.555]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:28:48.555 --> 01:28:49.898]  Merry Christmas, everybody!
[01:28:49.898 --> 01:28:53.065]  We'll be back as we attempt to retaste freedom.
[01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.890]  It's a no-brainer.

[01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:07.436]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:29:07.436 --> 01:29:09.377]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:06.215]  Op-op-op-optimum levels.
[01:32:07.284 --> 01:32:12.349]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:32:12.349 --> 01:32:14.251]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:32:14.251 --> 01:32:16.012]  B vitamins we need every day.
[01:32:16.012 --> 01:32:21.317]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[01:32:21.317 --> 01:32:23.599]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.

[01:32:29.285 --> 01:32:29.645]  Secret 12.
[01:32:30.726 --> 01:32:31.366]  We're good to go.
[01:33:00.131 --> 01:33:17.526]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.526 --> 01:33:23.772]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.152 --> 01:33:31.596]  Ladies and gentlemen, we undoubtedly have the biggest specials of the year every Christmas.
[01:33:31.596 --> 01:33:34.498]  And you also, when you get great products, you fund the operation.
[01:33:34.498 --> 01:33:36.799]  So it's a win-win, a no-brainer.
[01:33:36.799 --> 01:33:38.580]  I know you're busy, I'm busy.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:54.591]  If you'll just commit to go look at the thousands of items from high-quality shortwave radios, to books, to videos, to survival gear, to hundreds of great Patriot t-shirts to spread the word and meet like-minded people, to hundreds of great high-quality vitamins, minerals, supplements,
[01:33:56.087 --> 01:34:03.553]  We really do go out and find out the best research, the best scientists, and really bring you game changers.
[01:34:03.553 --> 01:34:15.062]  And I didn't think this was coming until January, and I bet on Dr. Grip's butt about this because it's got a bunch of proprietary products in it that are so hard to get that it's been sold out for over six months.
[01:34:15.062 --> 01:34:18.784]  And this would be the best seller we ever had if we could keep it in.
[01:34:19.909 --> 01:34:22.673]  But try to have it at California standards and all the rest of it.
[01:34:22.673 --> 01:34:29.163]  It's impossible with these ingredients because, you know, kale has 20 times the lead that this has.
[01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:31.466]  But that's a food, so California lets you have it.
[01:34:31.466 --> 01:34:33.289]  So we have to put stickers on this for California.
[01:34:34.889 --> 01:34:47.596]  Because it doesn't pass that California Standard Prop 65 they put in 20 years ago, you know, where the buildings say, this building's toxic, even if it's brand new, and the cars they sell there have big stickers, this is toxic, and it's just insane.
[01:34:47.596 --> 01:34:49.898]  So this has, I think, like,
[01:34:50.558 --> 01:35:00.702]  A third as much lead in it as kale does, but it's got herbs in it that have naturally occurring lead in it, so we tried to even source it where we could have it without it and have it pass California standards.
[01:35:00.702 --> 01:35:06.243]  By the way, you go to Whole Foods and 90% of it says it does not pass California standards, because nobody can.
[01:35:06.243 --> 01:35:10.485]  But again, I just said forget it, we're not doing it, we're putting a sticker on it.
[01:35:10.485 --> 01:35:13.206]  It doesn't pass stupid California baloney standards.
[01:35:14.206 --> 01:35:15.508]  For the lawyers passed that law.
[01:35:15.508 --> 01:35:17.510]  The air has more lead in it, okay?
[01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:18.772]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:35:18.772 --> 01:35:22.776]  The point is, is that it's amazing and it goes in.
[01:35:22.776 --> 01:35:28.483]  We're not just putting out a formula saying this knocks out yeast and candida and then put anything out and then if there was a problem we just change it.
[01:35:28.483 --> 01:35:29.565]  This is the formula that works.
[01:35:29.565 --> 01:35:30.906]  It's taken us six plus months.
[01:35:31.667 --> 01:35:54.702]  Even get it back in stock and people it has five star reviews it's insane and if you think just probiotics are good to displace the bad bacteria because all the pesticides in the food kill the good bacteria and they take good bacteria so that you can replace it that's a good thing to do we have flora life and carnivore enzyme they're all excellent 50 billion live enzymes you name it it's I mean 50 billion live live cultures it's all there but my cozy X
[01:35:55.342 --> 01:35:55.462]  Yes.
[01:36:13.564 --> 01:36:17.187]  You're like 10% that just say, okay, it's got a bunch of good herbs in it and compounds.
[01:36:17.187 --> 01:36:18.728]  MycoZX is back in stock.
[01:36:18.728 --> 01:36:20.830]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:22.512]  And when you get it, you fund the operation.

[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:35.163]  50% off the high-quality, fluoride-free, super blue toothpaste.
[01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:39.845]  Uh, that is, uh, empowered and fortified with colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:36:39.845 --> 01:36:42.066]  Uh, the real red pill, uh, now available.
[01:36:42.066 --> 01:36:46.407]  The best time to introduce yourself to these products and fund the info war and to commit into next year.
[01:36:46.407 --> 01:36:50.529]  You see the dividends you're getting right now with these tax cuts and the victories against globalism.
[01:36:50.529 --> 01:36:51.850]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:36:51.850 --> 01:36:52.590]  Please commit today.
[01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:57.472]  And you can still get these products before Christmas in most areas of the lower 48 if you order today.
[01:36:57.472 --> 01:37:02.914]  888-253-3139 if you want to order on via the phone or have any questions.
[01:37:02.914 --> 01:37:04.415]  Also, a great gift for Christmas!
[01:37:04.975 --> 01:37:06.696]  You didn't ask me to do this, but I'm going to do it.
[01:37:06.696 --> 01:37:07.856]  By the way, I want to carry the book.
[01:37:07.856 --> 01:37:09.217]  I don't think that's been done yet.
[01:37:09.217 --> 01:37:12.818]  That is the art of the argument from Stefan Molyneux.
[01:37:12.818 --> 01:37:21.361]  So before we get back into all this, because it's important to fund all our operations, you're being censored, you've been demonetized on YouTube, 90% so have we.
[01:37:21.361 --> 01:37:22.882]  They're trying to block us everywhere.
[01:37:22.882 --> 01:37:32.925]  So folks, if they want to hear more of this, see the websites get better and see more content and see people expand, then support, buy a book, subscribe to a special broadcast, whatever.
[01:37:32.925 --> 01:37:33.946]  How do folks do that, Stefan?
[01:37:35.481 --> 01:37:38.282]  Well, they can go to theartoftheargument.com and order the book.
[01:37:38.282 --> 01:37:42.322]  It's also available on audible.com, narrated by yours truly.
[01:37:42.322 --> 01:37:45.383]  And of course, freedomainradio.com slash donate.
[01:37:45.383 --> 01:37:50.064]  In this Christmas giving season, it's very, very helpful to help fund the operations and the growth.
[01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:55.024]  We just grew about 20% year over year, and it's been a great, fantastic year.
[01:37:55.024 --> 01:37:58.065]  We're well north of half a billion views and downloads.
[01:37:58.065 --> 01:38:04.006]  And people can help out the show, Bitcoin, PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, whatever, at freedomainradio.com slash donate.
[01:38:04.806 --> 01:38:07.547]  And let's be clear, we're not victims.
[01:38:07.547 --> 01:38:09.107]  So, we'll tell you.
[01:38:09.107 --> 01:38:12.028]  InfoWars has grown, usually 30-40% a year.
[01:38:12.028 --> 01:38:13.608]  We've tripled the last year.
[01:38:13.608 --> 01:38:16.209]  As everybody knows, we're under total attack.
[01:38:16.209 --> 01:38:19.730]  And they have just cut off millions in sponsorship, destroyed things.
[01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:24.191]  I mean, they've had black ops, disinfo teams.
[01:38:24.191 --> 01:38:27.332]  I'm not whining, it's actually quite entertaining and enjoyable and makes my life exciting.
[01:38:27.332 --> 01:38:28.752]  I'm serious, I'm not just saying that.
[01:38:28.752 --> 01:38:31.593]  That's kind of sad for my family, but that's, you know, I trust in God.
[01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:34.634]  They hate the fact that you're direct funding us.
[01:38:34.634 --> 01:38:36.235]  They're trying to shut that off.
[01:38:36.235 --> 01:38:38.916]  So Stefan's like, yeah, you know, we're growing 20% every year.
[01:38:38.916 --> 01:38:39.877]  They've been after him, too.
[01:38:39.877 --> 01:38:41.458]  So he's not going to whine about it.
[01:38:41.458 --> 01:38:43.899]  He's saying, hey, we're growing despite the attacks.
[01:38:43.899 --> 01:38:48.541]  We would have completely taken the culture back if they weren't fighting back.
[01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:49.322]  Just know this.
[01:38:49.322 --> 01:38:50.702]  A war is happening.
[01:38:50.702 --> 01:38:55.225]  It's critical to your own interest to know we're not funded by George Soros and globalists.
[01:38:55.225 --> 01:38:56.525]  We're funded by you.
[01:38:56.525 --> 01:38:59.467]  So we are your fist and we are taking action, Stefan.
[01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:05.217]  Well, let's sort of take a little bit of an example here, just to talk about the financial benefit to the listeners.
[01:39:05.217 --> 01:39:08.899]  Because, you know, cold hard cash runs the world and numbers don't lie.
[01:39:08.899 --> 01:39:14.503]  So your channel and my channel were very, very interested in Donald Trump.
[01:39:14.503 --> 01:39:19.427]  And although he is a man with flaws like us all... And I've paid for it with $70,000 a month.
[01:39:19.427 --> 01:39:20.187]  Now it's like $5,000.
[01:39:20.187 --> 01:39:22.529]  That's how we've paid.
[01:39:22.529 --> 01:39:24.290]  I've paid almost a million dollars.
[01:39:25.171 --> 01:39:31.754]  I did a lot of shows reaching millions of people about the lies that were being told about Donald Trump because for me it was a twofer.
[01:39:31.754 --> 01:39:36.917]  It was help get people to the truth about Trump and his agenda and also show just how much the mainstream media lies.
[01:39:36.917 --> 01:39:38.118]  How do you know they're lying?
[01:39:38.118 --> 01:39:38.898]  They're broadcast.
[01:39:38.898 --> 01:39:40.439]  And how much did you pay for telling the truth?
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.482]  Well, it was a bit of a challenge.
[01:39:43.482 --> 01:39:45.124]  Let's put it that way at times.
[01:39:45.124 --> 01:39:54.034]  But look, I mean, just look at so Donald Trump got in and now the biggest tax cut in US history has just been passed, which puts lots of money back into the hands of our listeners.
[01:39:54.034 --> 01:39:55.536]  So if you've helped supported the show,
[01:39:56.791 --> 01:39:58.973]  $20 a month, $50 a month, $5 a month, whatever.
[01:39:58.973 --> 01:40:02.435]  Bought some stuff from your store, bought my book, helped support things.
[01:40:02.435 --> 01:40:06.218]  I think it's kind of paid off, just in terms of you maybe getting thousands of dollars.
[01:40:06.218 --> 01:40:11.842]  But I just want to explain, we went from $70,000 a month when they delisted us and went like 95% demonetized.
[01:40:13.923 --> 01:40:26.444]  to again like seven to ten thousand a month I mean I'm not whining I want people to know this is what YouTube did to us and admittedly to punish us so I'm not saying hey look at me I'm just telling listeners thank God you're there we'd be gone because listeners filled in that gap
[01:40:27.637 --> 01:40:33.641]  You want to fund the people who are being opposed the most, because the people who are being opposed the most are doing the most.
[01:40:33.641 --> 01:40:38.664]  You know, if you're in a war and you're marching in the wrong direction, you're really not going to reach any opposition.
[01:40:38.664 --> 01:40:39.705]  Nobody's going to be fighting you.
[01:40:39.705 --> 01:40:44.588]  In fact, the other team, the other army, the enemy, are very happy that you're marching in the wrong direction.
[01:40:44.588 --> 01:40:49.351]  It's when you march in the right direction, I guess Wonder Woman style, that you run into the blistering fire.
[01:40:49.351 --> 01:40:53.434]  So look at the people who've got the most smoking craters around them and give them some ammo.
[01:40:54.212 --> 01:40:55.653]  Gosh, it's true.
[01:40:55.653 --> 01:40:56.633]  It's not that I'm even whining.
[01:40:56.633 --> 01:41:08.419]  I just want folks to know, like I'm a heat-seeking missile that goes towards their fire, like the World War II analogy of, they didn't have radar or satellite then, they went towards the flak because they would shoot, you know, wherever the factories were.
[01:41:08.419 --> 01:41:09.540]  And it's the same thing.
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:10.881]  We're steering into it.
[01:41:10.881 --> 01:41:15.243]  We just want folks to know, exactly as you said, whoever's being attacked the most is the key to spread.
[01:41:16.991 --> 01:41:27.280]  There is no substitute for, and it's a great kind of radar, because when you look at the people who are being attacked the most, and listen, there are people who are wrong and it depends how you're being attacked.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:33.746]  If you put it, like if I put out an argument that has some incorrect data or I've made a reasoning error, fantastic, you know, people will tell me that.
[01:41:33.746 --> 01:41:37.690]  But instead it's racist scum, you have, they're not attacking us on what we did.
[01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:39.252]  Right.
[01:41:39.252 --> 01:41:52.319]  And if they go after you at this hysterical, venomous, puff-atter, viper-strike personal level, yeah, he's a this, he's a that, and they just try to bury you in negative adjectives, that means you're doing something right.
[01:41:52.319 --> 01:41:55.821]  And so when people are being attacked, libeled, slandered, lied about, and so on,
[01:41:56.341 --> 01:42:01.023]  That's when you really want to pay them attention, because they're not fools.
[01:42:01.023 --> 01:42:02.264]  The enemies are not fools.
[01:42:02.264 --> 01:42:09.287]  They know who's having the most impact, and they also know when the person having the most impact has good reason and evidence behind them.
[01:42:09.287 --> 01:42:13.889]  Because if you've got bad reason and evidence, you just say, oh, the data is contradictory.
[01:42:13.889 --> 01:42:14.369]  Exactly.
[01:42:14.369 --> 01:42:18.230]  We have their number, we know their program, and we're winning.
[01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:18.991]  That's why they hate us.
[01:42:20.225 --> 01:42:21.846]  And they have openly told.
[01:42:21.846 --> 01:42:26.668]  They have openly told everyone through the Saul Alinsky book, Rules for Radicals, and a lot of other publications.
[01:42:26.668 --> 01:42:36.512]  They've openly said, we just want power, we just want control, we don't have any values, we don't have any ethics, we don't have any standards, but we know our enemies do, and we're dying to use them against them.
[01:42:36.812 --> 01:42:39.153]  Yes, Saul Alinsky said, I worship Lucifer.
[01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:41.515]  I pledge myself to Lucifer in the intro of his book.
[01:42:41.515 --> 01:42:43.956]  And the New York Times of the day said, we love Saul Alinsky.
[01:42:43.956 --> 01:42:44.717]  We're going to defeat you.
[01:42:44.717 --> 01:42:46.078]  He's our God.
[01:42:46.078 --> 01:42:47.699]  Stefan Mullin has got a bunch of topics.
[01:42:47.699 --> 01:42:48.539]  I'm not going to bring up a topic.
[01:42:48.539 --> 01:42:52.341]  I'm going to see what he wants to cover next on the other side of this quick break.
[01:42:52.341 --> 01:42:54.243]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:42:54.243 --> 01:42:54.663]  Stay with us.
[01:42:56.334 --> 01:43:03.800]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:17.010]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:43:17.952 --> 01:43:29.837]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:43:29.837 --> 01:43:35.800]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:45.570]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:43:45.570 --> 01:43:53.759]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.081]  I'm so excited.
[01:43:57.081 --> 01:44:07.247]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[01:44:07.247 --> 01:44:12.751]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:12.751 --> 01:44:15.753]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:15.753 --> 01:44:24.559]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:46.207]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:46.207 --> 01:44:48.888]  It is amazing!
[01:44:48.888 --> 01:44:53.870]  Red Pill, now available at Infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:44:57.185 --> 01:44:58.606]  Why is the fungus?
[01:44:58.606 --> 01:44:59.667]  Why is the mold?
[01:44:59.667 --> 01:45:01.428]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:02.389]  What is going on?
[01:45:02.389 --> 01:45:03.149]  What has changed?
[01:45:27.445 --> 01:45:28.866]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:45:28.866 --> 01:45:30.046]  I want to get your reviews.
[01:45:30.046 --> 01:45:30.846]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:45:30.846 --> 01:45:32.487]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:45:32.487 --> 01:45:36.848]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[01:45:36.848 --> 01:45:37.548]  Get it today.
[01:45:37.548 --> 01:45:38.148]  Limited run.
[01:45:38.148 --> 01:45:39.569]  It'll be months till we get more.
[01:45:39.569 --> 01:45:44.210]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:47.571]  I cannot tell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:45:47.571 --> 01:45:49.891]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:45:49.891 --> 01:45:51.292]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:45:51.292 --> 01:45:53.232]  We're changing the world together.
[01:45:53.232 --> 01:45:54.253]  You are the Infowar.
[01:45:54.253 --> 01:45:54.993]  God bless you all.
[01:45:56.491 --> 01:46:08.597]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:46:08.597 --> 01:46:09.957]  So what do we do about it?
[01:46:09.957 --> 01:46:13.299]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:46:13.299 --> 01:46:19.382]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush
[01:46:19.782 --> 01:46:21.043]  Without the crash!
[01:46:21.043 --> 01:46:27.308]  RainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[01:46:27.308 --> 01:46:33.233]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extract.
[01:46:33.233 --> 01:46:35.195]  It gives you an added kick!
[01:46:36.035 --> 01:46:48.781]  Other ingredients include vitamin B12 and neurological tonic and cognitive enhancers that will allow you to flip the switch and supercharge your state of mind.
[01:46:48.781 --> 01:46:50.082]  It's the real deal.
[01:46:50.082 --> 01:46:51.823]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:46:51.823 --> 01:47:00.127]  Secure your bottle right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:00.127 --> 01:47:02.748]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:13.664 --> 01:47:18.969]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:47:18.969 --> 01:47:21.292]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:47:33.112 --> 01:47:40.877]  Faced with libel suit, dossier drafter Christopher Steele, who got paid by the FBI to put it out, hedges on linking Trump to Russia.
[01:47:40.877 --> 01:47:42.238]  Now in court documents he says he can't.
[01:47:42.238 --> 01:47:45.120]  I mean, it has imploded, okay?
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.322]  And then the crimes, but that's a secondary thing.
[01:47:47.322 --> 01:47:52.726]  The big one is, I haven't mentioned it today, is 19 people injured, his car deliberately hits pedestrians in Melbourne.
[01:47:53.624 --> 01:47:59.667]  You know, for every car attack, one out of a hundred might be somebody else, but it's always Islamists the other times.
[01:47:59.667 --> 01:48:04.169]  And I noticed that CNN didn't say it was Islamists, even though he pledged allegiance to ISIS.
[01:48:04.169 --> 01:48:07.031]  They said he was mentally ill.
[01:48:07.031 --> 01:48:16.995]  Mental health issues, Muslim who rammed 18 people with a car, has no link to terror, because they say, and now they're saying the guy that attacked New York was mentally ill.
[01:48:16.995 --> 01:48:21.798]  Well, of course they're mentally ill, but they're being directed by a monothelistic death cult.
[01:48:22.912 --> 01:48:32.215]  That the left bizarrely is sided with, because just as our guest just was talking about earlier, it's this whole Saul Alinsky power.
[01:48:32.215 --> 01:48:37.457]  What's crazy is you read the elite books of Karl Marx and V.I.
[01:48:37.457 --> 01:48:38.357]  Lenin and all these people.
[01:48:38.357 --> 01:48:42.859]  They say, we love Lucifer, but Lenin was a devil worshiper.
[01:48:42.859 --> 01:48:44.340]  It doesn't mean he even believes in a devil.
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:45.140]  He is the devil.
[01:48:46.087 --> 01:48:51.894]  You know, it's kind of like a lot of the top Google people say, I don't believe in God, yet I'm going to be one.
[01:48:51.894 --> 01:48:52.735]  Kurzweil.
[01:48:52.735 --> 01:48:56.619]  So it's megalomania is what it is, and it's the same craziness.
[01:48:56.619 --> 01:49:04.488]  So I said, hey, whatever topic you want to cover, but I'm just throwing this out because the Europeans have come out a new poll saying immigration terrorism is the biggest issue.
[01:49:05.449 --> 01:49:12.595]  40% said, while they're being oppressed, and told, if you report what color somebody is, we'll arrest you.
[01:49:12.595 --> 01:49:13.776]  And we're not joking!
[01:49:13.776 --> 01:49:17.779]  This is like naked, crazy authoritarianism.
[01:49:17.779 --> 01:49:26.606]  I hope this is the last desperate gasp of the authoritarian left, but even though we're getting a few beachheads here, I don't think we're out of the woods yet.
[01:49:26.606 --> 01:49:28.647]  Stefan Molyneux.
[01:49:28.647 --> 01:49:30.969]  It's horrible and tragic.
[01:49:31.656 --> 01:49:32.997]  And I'm kind of torn.
[01:49:32.997 --> 01:49:36.498]  I'll tell you straight up, Alex, I'm really ambivalent about this.
[01:49:36.498 --> 01:49:41.060]  I do want the mainstream media to reform themselves, and I kind of don't.
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:46.483]  You know that old saying, never interrupt your enemy when he's in the process of making one giant mistake after another?
[01:49:46.483 --> 01:49:59.669]  The fact that they are so doubling down on avoiding basic issues like demographics, like IQ, like belief systems, like compatibility, like welfare usage, like crime statistics, the fact that they're so steadfastly
[01:50:00.209 --> 01:50:08.093]  Covering their eyes, sticking their heads in the sand and screaming la la la la like a half upside down ostrich is creating massive market opportunities for us.
[01:50:08.093 --> 01:50:14.037]  If they reform themselves and if they start telling basic truths about the world, people will start tuning into them rather than us.
[01:50:14.037 --> 01:50:16.138]  So it's not like I just want people to watch me.
[01:50:16.138 --> 01:50:22.301]  If they really reform themselves, I'd be happy to have fewer audiences because that would mean more truth would be getting to the world.
[01:50:22.301 --> 01:50:22.501]  Exactly!
[01:50:22.501 --> 01:50:25.403]  Defeating this plague of crazies, that's all I want!
[01:50:25.403 --> 01:50:26.623]  But the left is one to keep problems going!
[01:50:26.623 --> 01:50:27.544]  I just want more sanity in the world!
[01:50:28.106 --> 01:50:31.930]  Yeah, I just... Now, the fact that they are literally delusional.
[01:50:31.930 --> 01:50:36.895]  I mean, of course they're talking about mental illness, because leftism is a mental illness!
[01:50:36.895 --> 01:50:41.239]  It is a steadfast denial of basic biological empirical reality.
[01:50:41.239 --> 01:50:50.849]  It is a denial of universal moral values, like thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not thirst for demonic power over thy fellow bipeds.
[01:50:51.409 --> 01:51:01.158]  It is a denial of reality, it is a denial of virtue, it is a denial of compassion, and it arises from a childhood-written, empathetic grave of maltreatment.
[01:51:01.158 --> 01:51:07.885]  And so it is, of course they say that these people are mentally ill, because they're mentally ill!
[01:51:07.885 --> 01:51:10.567]  Expanding on that, Russiagate, what other topics?
[01:51:10.567 --> 01:51:14.171]  I've got hundreds, but I want to hear what's front and center on Stefan Molyneux's brain.
[01:51:14.926 --> 01:51:25.114]  Well, I want to think about Christmas just a little bit, because, you know, we spend a lot of time fighting the forces of darkness, and it is important to love and remember to turn towards the light.
[01:51:25.114 --> 01:51:30.778]  So, if you've had a year of combat, I suggest you rest and enjoy your time of Christmas.
[01:51:30.778 --> 01:51:35.742]  It's funny you say that, because I never rest, and I'm committed... I apologize for interrupting.
[01:51:35.742 --> 01:51:37.143]  I'm committed to actually taking off next week.
[01:51:37.143 --> 01:51:37.584]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:51:38.513 --> 01:51:44.056]  Well, so if you fought the good fight, rest, enjoy and get ready for next year.
[01:51:44.056 --> 01:51:51.800]  If you haven't, then rest anyway and gear up to commit to next year, which is going to be one hell of a year to be fighting.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.320]  Well, that's my next question for you.
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:55.441]  That's why we're mind melded.
[01:51:55.441 --> 01:51:57.522]  Yes, this was the most insane year of my life.
[01:51:57.522 --> 01:51:59.343]  Everybody else says it was good, the bad, the ugly.
[01:51:59.343 --> 01:52:01.324]  It was incredible year of change.
[01:52:01.324 --> 01:52:01.624]  What is 2018?
[01:52:04.944 --> 01:52:07.828]  Well, 2018 is the Ragnarok of freedom.
[01:52:07.828 --> 01:52:23.406]  2018 is the final battle, I think, because either there's going to be a tipping point where people start to go towards the truth tellers and those who have virtue, compassion, empathy, and goodness in their heart, or they're going to slide down to the satanic pit of the sophists and the liars.
[01:52:24.278 --> 01:52:25.679]  We have to up our game.
[01:52:25.679 --> 01:52:31.663]  We who are out there in the public sphere telling the truth, we have to be more engaging, more entertaining, more enjoyable.
[01:52:31.663 --> 01:52:38.967]  We have to use every trick in the book to pull people towards the giant geyser light of freedom that we pursue and represent.
[01:52:38.967 --> 01:52:45.811]  We have to up our game and not just stare at the demons in hatred, but stare at the light and the virtues in joy.
[01:52:45.811 --> 01:52:48.493]  Because there's only a certain amount of opposition that's going to attract people.
[01:52:48.493 --> 01:52:49.834]  We have to show people what we love
[01:52:50.334 --> 01:52:51.194]  As well as what we hate.
[01:52:51.194 --> 01:52:52.455]  Like the old thing about the soldier.
[01:52:52.455 --> 01:52:55.115]  The soldier doesn't fight because he hates what's in front of him.
[01:52:55.115 --> 01:52:57.476]  He fights because he loves what he's protecting.
[01:52:57.476 --> 01:52:58.536]  He loves what's behind him.
[01:52:58.536 --> 01:53:01.557]  So we have to remember to share the love of freedom.
[01:53:01.557 --> 01:53:03.338]  The love of free markets.
[01:53:03.338 --> 01:53:04.458]  The love of free speech.
[01:53:04.458 --> 01:53:05.978]  The love of gun ownership.
[01:53:05.978 --> 01:53:10.840]  We have to remember to share what we love in order to attract people to our cause.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:13.701]  And not just simply as the old saying that Nietzsche has said.
[01:53:13.701 --> 01:53:18.202]  If you hunt monsters your whole life, you have to be very careful you do not turn into one.
[01:53:19.659 --> 01:53:20.860]  Total Veritas.
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:40.616]  You know, I woke up at 3.30 in the morning and I couldn't go back to sleep and I wrote down a bunch of notes and I forgot to bring them of course, but that was one of them, was that just celebrate and just turn loose and appreciate kind of in a Zen moment all that is good and magnify that and think about the good instead of hating the evil so much that I tend to do and there's a place for that but I had that
[01:53:41.616 --> 01:53:52.163]  I've never really experienced this much in my life, but now that I had the feeling of all that, it was kind of like, not turning loose, but feeling the source and like resting back into it.
[01:53:52.163 --> 01:53:55.144]  I mean, this really is metaphysical, hermetic.
[01:53:55.144 --> 01:54:00.227]  I mean, we know all this, and that's why I know next year is the Battle of the Gods.
[01:54:00.227 --> 01:54:04.229]  You know, as you just said, the Guru Dharmanand.
[01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:05.730]  And of course, things repeat themselves.
[01:54:05.730 --> 01:54:08.072]  We're not saying the final Battle of the Gods, but a model of that.
[01:54:08.652 --> 01:54:13.714]  Because they're going to throw everything, and for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:54:13.714 --> 01:54:24.358]  Quantum mechanics shows, and I feel my personal discernment energy increasing because the enemy is now about to throw its full weight against us.
[01:54:24.358 --> 01:54:29.840]  So don't think just because we feel all this energy and strength right now that that's because we're totally want to be arrogant.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:32.341]  That's because we're like Godzilla.
[01:54:32.341 --> 01:54:33.901]  Something big's about to come out of the ocean.
[01:54:33.901 --> 01:54:35.062]  The big fight's about to happen.
[01:54:36.195 --> 01:54:42.377]  Well, that's true, and it is going to be on social media, it's going to be on YouTube, it's going to be on Facebook, it's going to be on the Internet.
[01:54:42.377 --> 01:54:48.600]  Because the Internet was the very great equation variable that they did not anticipate.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:55.722]  The Internet was responsible for getting Donald Trump in power and keeping Hillary Clinton, the sorceress of iniquity, out of power.
[01:54:55.722 --> 01:54:58.083]  So they're very aware where the true power resides.
[01:54:58.083 --> 01:55:00.464]  They can read the numbers of subscriptions as well as we can.
[01:55:00.464 --> 01:55:01.544]  They know where the audience is.
[01:55:01.544 --> 01:55:03.385]  And they've gone from being arrogant to panic.
[01:55:03.385 --> 01:55:05.426]  That makes them stronger now that they're not arrogant anymore.
[01:55:06.215 --> 01:55:07.816]  But more dangerous, right?
[01:55:07.816 --> 01:55:12.219]  Because when people panic, cornered animals get more random in their behavior.
[01:55:12.219 --> 01:55:16.982]  So yeah, you need to be alert, but we do need, you know, we fight ugliness, but we worship beauty.
[01:55:16.982 --> 01:55:28.949]  And we must remember to turn away from the ugliness, to drink deep of the cup of beauty, to inspire people with the beauty of the world that we want to create, rather than simply showing people all the time how ugly is the enemies we face.
[01:55:28.949 --> 01:55:32.652]  Because people will be drawn to that beauty and that beauty, that love,
[01:55:33.092 --> 01:55:36.976]  You know, we may fear the devil, but we love God, if that's where virtue lives in our hearts.
[01:55:36.976 --> 01:55:42.122]  And we must remember to bring people to church, rather than to the exorcism all the time.
[01:55:42.122 --> 01:55:43.043]  You're right.
[01:55:43.043 --> 01:55:44.284]  That is literally the epiphany I had.
[01:55:44.284 --> 01:55:45.405]  I know it's a common truth.
[01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:46.146]  I'm like, I discovered it.
[01:55:46.146 --> 01:55:46.786]  You're absolutely right.
[01:55:46.786 --> 01:55:50.430]  But I think that's spreading right now, is that we need to celebrate our victories, be thankful.
[01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:54.214]  And as you said, we fight evil, but we love beauty.
[01:55:54.214 --> 01:55:55.696]  We fight evil to protect beauty.
[01:55:57.074 --> 01:56:05.381]  And if we allow all of our actions to be dictated by evildoers, we simply are the shadow cast by immorality in the world.
[01:56:05.381 --> 01:56:06.922]  And that is not enough.
[01:56:06.922 --> 01:56:08.003]  We really must.
[01:56:08.003 --> 01:56:12.467]  We can show the darkness by being the light, just as much as going down to the dungeons.
[01:56:12.467 --> 01:56:17.832]  You know, if you brighten something up and if something's in the way of the light, it casts a long and highly visible shadow.
[01:56:17.832 --> 01:56:22.396]  And if we blaze brightly in our joy of truth and beauty and virtue, then we will show
[01:56:22.956 --> 01:56:27.879]  The horrifying nature of those we oppose far more than if we go down and fight them all the time.
[01:56:27.879 --> 01:56:33.141]  How did Hercules defeat it when he had to go into the dark where his final feat of memory serves?
[01:56:33.141 --> 01:56:37.283]  And I guess he had to like go inwardly to the light that was within him to defeat it.
[01:56:37.283 --> 01:56:38.644]  It wasn't battling anymore.
[01:56:38.644 --> 01:56:40.805]  He couldn't beat the darkness by sheer will.
[01:56:40.805 --> 01:56:45.067]  He had to think about the light that was in him that God had given him to defeat it.
[01:56:46.303 --> 01:56:48.084]  Jesus was not a ninja.
[01:56:48.084 --> 01:56:49.965]  Jesus had no nunchucks.
[01:56:49.965 --> 01:56:55.388]  Jesus was somebody who pursued and talked about virtue and the light and sacrificed himself for it.
[01:56:55.388 --> 01:57:02.572]  And in that sacrifice, he created an epiphany of beauty and virtue that people have been following for thousands of years.
[01:57:02.572 --> 01:57:04.793]  And that's not a bad model to be following.
[01:57:04.793 --> 01:57:06.054]  And that's why they hate it so much.
[01:57:07.406 --> 01:57:08.006]  Right.
[01:57:08.006 --> 01:57:11.467]  Because they could not taunt Jesus into fighting at their level.
[01:57:11.467 --> 01:57:14.008]  They could not taunt Jesus into fighting at their level.
[01:57:14.008 --> 01:57:20.669]  He transcended their level and provoked a following that was, in many ways, the true foundation and beauty of Western civilization.
[01:57:20.669 --> 01:57:22.850]  And just like they attack Christ, they attack Uncle Tom.
[01:57:22.850 --> 01:57:25.090]  Because Uncle Tom wasn't a wimp, he was strong.
[01:57:25.090 --> 01:57:28.071]  He just let them kill him and torture him to bring them down.
[01:57:28.071 --> 01:57:30.492]  And the fools see that and go, look at this idiot.
[01:57:30.492 --> 01:57:31.532]  But he sacrificed himself.
[01:57:33.090 --> 01:57:38.313]  Yeah, just when they think you've lost is the time for your greatest victory, and that, I think, is next year.
[01:57:38.313 --> 01:57:38.673]  All right.
[01:57:38.673 --> 01:57:38.974]  Wow.
[01:57:38.974 --> 01:57:41.495]  Well, we'll be there together, hopefully, if they haven't done the internet kill switch.
[01:57:41.495 --> 01:57:42.176]  Thank you, Stefan.
[01:57:42.176 --> 01:57:42.736]  Very powerful.

[01:58:47.386 --> 01:58:53.374]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[01:58:53.374 --> 01:58:57.540]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:03.788]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:12.715]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:59:12.715 --> 01:59:18.580]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:30.729]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[01:59:31.169 --> 01:59:33.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:12.669 --> 02:00:18.172]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:18.172 --> 02:00:29.960]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:39.926]  All right, in this short little segment before our next guest joins us, a former board member of the Davos Group, head of the Aspen Institute, highest levels of the globalist operation,
[02:00:40.919 --> 02:00:48.563]  He wants to get into Luciferianism, Satanism, the operating system of the psychopaths we're facing.
[02:00:48.563 --> 02:00:51.905]  Ted Malik joining us coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:51.905 --> 02:01:10.354]  But I wanted to get into Senator Warner, because again, if their whole Russiagate's falling apart, if the head of the PPgate dossier has now come out in court and said, well, there isn't Russian collusion in it, because they're getting sued for saying it, so he goes, oh no, we didn't actually say it in the dossier, there's no proof, it's not real.
[02:01:11.223 --> 02:01:16.247]  That's in the news today out of the Washington Times.
[02:01:16.247 --> 02:01:28.356]  They haven't told their minions that yet, so Warner comes out with press conferences almost every day, along with that shiftless creature Schiff, and they get up there and they go, don't you try to fire him!
[02:01:28.356 --> 02:01:29.377]  You stop it, Archer!
[02:01:29.377 --> 02:01:32.519]  And Trump's like, I'm not gonna fire him, he's falling apart.
[02:01:32.519 --> 02:01:33.020]  He's a joke.
[02:01:38.197 --> 02:01:39.397]  It's an embarrassment to them.
[02:01:39.397 --> 02:01:40.718]  The whole thing's a fraud.
[02:01:40.718 --> 02:01:42.879]  It's blowing up in their face.
[02:01:42.879 --> 02:01:46.760]  But they just came out saying, don't you fire him to act like it's got all this gravity.
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:48.400]  To act like he's scared of it.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:50.141]  That's their cover story.
[02:01:50.141 --> 02:01:51.401]  And it's so pathetic.
[02:01:51.401 --> 02:01:53.942]  Meanwhile, Kent Daniels just wrote a story that needs to go viral.
[02:01:53.942 --> 02:01:57.223]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:01:57.223 --> 02:02:00.064]  Because you know we're winning, but some of the public doesn't.
[02:02:00.064 --> 02:02:02.345]  So it's neck and neck here sometimes.
[02:02:02.345 --> 02:02:03.325]  Not quite neck and neck now.
[02:02:03.325 --> 02:02:04.406]  We're going to pull it away a bit.
[02:02:04.406 --> 02:02:07.327]  Let's not, like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start
[02:02:08.027 --> 02:02:11.410]  You know, doing you-know-what to each other yet, because we're not there yet, okay?
[02:02:11.410 --> 02:02:11.991]  We're never there.
[02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:14.653]  As soon as you think you're there, you know, it's all over.
[02:02:14.653 --> 02:02:18.657]  Trump re-election odds explode after first-year tax cuts.
[02:02:18.657 --> 02:02:20.959]  I'll start the next segment with that, Juicy.
[02:02:20.959 --> 02:02:30.447]  Ronald Reagan famously said, he said, when I met Donald Trump, it was like I was meeting the president and I knew he would end up being the president with Roger Stone, so I'm going to meet with him.
[02:02:31.768 --> 02:02:38.273]  And then Reagan had folks call Stone and called Stone back and said, something about that guy.
[02:02:38.273 --> 02:02:41.495]  He didn't even need to run him for office.
[02:02:41.495 --> 02:02:43.176]  By the way, Reagan never did that.
[02:02:43.176 --> 02:02:43.836]  So there you go.
[02:02:43.836 --> 02:02:45.597]  It's all destiny, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:45.597 --> 02:02:49.560]  What matters about Trump is delivery.
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:51.521]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:02:51.521 --> 02:02:52.402]  Judge it by its fruits.
[02:02:52.402 --> 02:02:53.903]  Until the enemy attacks us.
[02:02:53.903 --> 02:02:56.625]  They're not stupid.
[02:02:56.625 --> 02:02:56.885]  They know.
[02:02:58.439 --> 02:03:00.160]  I am, they think I'm an insane maniac.
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.200]  They're trying to buy me off.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:06.401]  $10 million a year is what the last number got to over a decade ago.
[02:03:06.401 --> 02:03:07.822]  Well, we're ways past that.
[02:03:07.822 --> 02:03:08.862]  It's not about me and $10 million.
[02:03:08.862 --> 02:03:13.564]  It's about how much money do I have in the bank if I have to fight them when they come after me, which they're already doing.
[02:03:13.564 --> 02:03:17.325]  How much money do I have to build an operation and try to go after them?
[02:03:17.325 --> 02:03:18.145]  Oh, you want to kill me?
[02:03:18.145 --> 02:03:19.345]  Let's go all the way.
[02:03:19.345 --> 02:03:24.747]  But here's Warner with his incredible, and it's all fake, trying to look all powerful and like, to look distinguished.
[02:03:25.627 --> 02:03:26.648]  It's all a con game.
[02:03:26.648 --> 02:03:28.889]  They're all failed actors, basically.
[02:03:28.889 --> 02:03:29.989]  Here he is.
[02:03:29.989 --> 02:03:41.274]  I rise today, concerned about the threats to the special counsel's critical investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
[02:03:41.274 --> 02:03:45.796]  Over the last several weeks, a growing chorus of irresponsible
[02:03:46.678 --> 02:03:51.421]  See, criticizing your fake investigation is shutting it down.
[02:03:51.421 --> 02:03:51.681]  No it's not.
[02:03:51.681 --> 02:03:54.102]  And then we figured out we're kicking your ass and we said don't do it.
[02:04:10.288 --> 02:04:12.309]  Well, buddy, don't worry, it isn't gonna happen!
[02:04:32.006 --> 02:04:33.307]  You dumbass.
[02:04:33.307 --> 02:04:35.608]  Trying to change the whole subject, excuse me.
[02:04:35.608 --> 02:04:38.230]  I mean, what a sack of parasitic crap.
[02:04:38.230 --> 02:04:42.032]  That's the type of stuff the globals put in this country to get in power to screw us over.
[02:04:42.032 --> 02:04:42.773]  And guess what?
[02:04:42.773 --> 02:04:44.674]  The tide turns, scum.
[02:04:44.674 --> 02:04:47.035]  Like all those other senators that aren't running for re-election.
[02:04:47.035 --> 02:04:49.016]  And you better start getting ready not to run for it.
[02:04:49.016 --> 02:04:52.158]  Because don't worry, everything we know about you is about to come out, Warner.
[02:04:52.158 --> 02:04:52.579]  Get ready.
[02:04:55.089 --> 02:04:59.512]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:04:59.512 --> 02:05:07.597]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:05:07.597 --> 02:05:12.881]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:05:12.881 --> 02:05:15.402]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:05:15.402 --> 02:05:19.645]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:05:19.645 --> 02:05:22.067]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:05:22.756 --> 02:05:29.998]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:05:29.998 --> 02:05:38.061]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:05:38.061 --> 02:05:45.244]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:05:45.244 --> 02:05:46.704]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:05:46.704 --> 02:05:48.505]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[02:06:22.213 --> 02:06:24.895]  Anthrax!
[02:06:24.895 --> 02:06:25.095]  Anthrax!
[02:06:25.095 --> 02:06:25.615]  And radio!
[02:06:25.615 --> 02:06:28.877]  And radio!
[02:06:28.877 --> 02:06:32.579]  Anthrax!
[02:06:32.579 --> 02:06:34.701]  It's not entertainment.
[02:06:34.701 --> 02:06:36.662]  It's information warfare.
[02:06:36.662 --> 02:06:39.344]  Brought to you from deep in the heart of the ATX.
[02:06:39.344 --> 02:06:42.466]  In occupied blue state territory.
[02:06:42.466 --> 02:06:45.047]  Returning the Republic from deep behind enemy lines.
[02:06:45.047 --> 02:06:46.668]  I'm your guest.
[02:06:46.668 --> 02:06:47.889]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:06:47.889 --> 02:06:50.651]  We have our guest Ted Mallet getting lined up right now.
[02:06:51.687 --> 02:06:52.667]  First, Ivanka!
[02:07:08.895 --> 02:07:26.211]  Ivanka Trump talking about just the child tax credit, one of the 30 little juicy gifts of our own money back to us to choose how we want to spend our money and hence social engineer things according to the people's will, not a bunch of hunchback
[02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:37.410]  Skeksis in D.C., New York, and L.A., and Hollywood, who again want to just cuckol everything because they're demonic hunchback demons that know they should be thrown to the furnaces of hell immediately.
[02:07:37.410 --> 02:07:39.273]  Let's go ahead now and go to this video.
[02:07:41.087 --> 02:07:48.871]  Your name actually has been linked to this for a while because you were pushing an increase in the child tax credit.
[02:07:48.871 --> 02:07:57.415]  In the ultimate final bill, it essentially is doubled, and I know you also had Mike Lee with you, the senator from Utah, and Marco Rubio as well.
[02:07:57.415 --> 02:07:59.896]  Explain to the folks at home what it's going to do for them.
[02:08:00.745 --> 02:08:17.707]  Well, the President was very clear that he really wanted to ensure that this bill accomplished two goals of enabling American businesses to grow and be competitive and therefore lead to wage increase for working Americans, but to also target relief and middle-income families.
[02:08:18.227 --> 02:08:21.591]  And the Child Tax Credit is an incredible vehicle to do that.
[02:08:21.591 --> 02:08:28.878]  We all know the cost of raising children has gone up exponentially in this country, as until recently wages have stagnated.
[02:08:28.878 --> 02:08:35.645]  So raising children is very expensive, but it's the most important investment that we as a country can make in the future.
[02:08:37.446 --> 02:08:42.610]  This is the next generation of American workers, American entrepreneurs and innovators.
[02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:44.911]  So the child tax credit was doubled.
[02:08:44.911 --> 02:08:47.573]  The refundability was expanded.
[02:08:47.573 --> 02:08:58.620]  Very importantly, the standard deduction, the standard for the average family, the standard deduction was actually doubled, which is enormously beneficial.
[02:08:58.620 --> 02:08:59.320]  It's incredible.
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:01.002]  We're going to pay more taxes here, actually.
[02:09:15.401 --> 02:09:22.046]  There were things like the child tax credit that would have such meaningful impact for everyday Americans.
[02:09:22.046 --> 02:09:33.115]  One of the things that was really so amazing to me in traveling across the country is just the sense of financial fragility most American families experience.
[02:09:33.115 --> 02:09:35.196]  Even middle-income American families.
[02:09:35.196 --> 02:09:40.340]  The average American family can't come up with $400 in the event of an emergency.
[02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:42.982]  And my father is committed to changing that.
[02:09:42.982 --> 02:09:45.124]  This administration is committed to changing that.
[02:09:45.524 --> 02:09:46.945]  Amen.
[02:09:46.945 --> 02:09:52.609]  But see, the globalists want a bankruptcy, Cloward and Piven, to be able to reorganize everything.
[02:09:52.609 --> 02:09:53.190]  That's the plan.
[02:09:53.190 --> 02:09:54.731]  I mean, they admit it.
[02:09:54.731 --> 02:09:57.273]  It's not like we're just here seeing it and going, it looks like that.
[02:09:57.273 --> 02:09:59.874]  That's what they say.
[02:09:59.874 --> 02:10:08.901]  And so when you realize that, it's just so cold-blooded what they're up to and how close they got us to the edge of that precipice.
[02:10:11.021 --> 02:10:14.222]  And how sweeter it makes this reprieve.
[02:10:14.222 --> 02:10:20.804]  But we better work harder and realize the globalists, the leftists, they admit in the New York Times that they are just energized.
[02:10:20.804 --> 02:10:22.105]  Soros gave $18 billion.
[02:10:22.105 --> 02:10:25.966]  He usually spends about $500 million a year trying to bring down the U.S.
[02:10:25.966 --> 02:10:26.886]  And now it's $18 billion.
[02:10:26.886 --> 02:10:27.786]  But here's the deal.
[02:10:27.786 --> 02:10:30.027]  You go see who he can muster out on the streets.
[02:10:30.027 --> 02:10:32.248]  He's trying to beat a huge wave.
[02:10:32.248 --> 02:10:34.048]  And historically, you just can't do that.
[02:10:34.048 --> 02:10:35.989]  We're going to go to Ted Malik here in just a moment.
[02:10:35.989 --> 02:10:38.410]  But I wanted to play this clip because this triggered the left.
[02:10:39.490 --> 02:10:46.152]  To have Congressman up there, Tim Scott, who they say could end up being the next president down the road.
[02:10:46.152 --> 02:10:47.032]  Who cares if he's black?
[02:10:47.032 --> 02:10:48.572]  All I care about is his brain.
[02:10:48.572 --> 02:10:49.573]  He's a patriot.
[02:10:49.573 --> 02:10:56.474]  He's shaking with pleasure when he realizes how much true affirmative action under Trump's plan is already being dumped into inner city areas.
[02:10:56.474 --> 02:10:58.735]  Real jobs, high paying.
[02:10:58.735 --> 02:11:02.316]  These aren't just fake make work stuff turning into a social worker with no pay.
[02:11:02.316 --> 02:11:03.156]  This is the real deal.
[02:11:04.090 --> 02:11:10.172]  And this has got them so incredibly panicked right now.
[02:11:10.172 --> 02:11:17.334]  This has them scared because they were so close to seizing control of America and using it as a pure engine of evil.
[02:11:17.334 --> 02:11:25.296]  You think the Russians were bad when they went in and took the Czars out in 1917 at a moment of weakness and turned Russia into an engine of evil?
[02:11:25.296 --> 02:11:26.696]  That was bad!
[02:11:26.696 --> 02:11:30.457]  Can you imagine the United States as a pure engine of evil?
[02:11:30.457 --> 02:11:32.218]  This has been a mixed bag the last 50 years.
[02:11:33.447 --> 02:11:37.132]  Pure psychopath-driven evil by the globalists.
[02:11:37.132 --> 02:11:38.474]  The Hollywood globalist type.
[02:11:38.474 --> 02:11:39.856]  I mean, good God!
[02:11:41.024 --> 02:11:42.545]  Good God!
[02:11:42.545 --> 02:11:46.589]  We'd have to go to the emergency backups, wouldn't we, that they laid down.
[02:11:46.589 --> 02:11:48.951]  They couldn't get our second, they're going up to the first right now.
[02:11:48.951 --> 02:12:00.641]  So here's the congressman, Tim Scott, who's got them all triggered, calling him Uncle Tom, all these names, blah, blah, blah, because the left's been good at making black folks not think they can be part of the Tea Party, or part of the Republican Party.
[02:12:00.641 --> 02:12:03.644]  While the Republican Party said, we want to run you for office, you've got a good background, good person.
[02:12:03.644 --> 02:12:06.246]  Well, we've got the staff saying, we want you in here.
[02:12:06.246 --> 02:12:08.168]  If you're a minority, the White House wants to hire you.
[02:12:08.288 --> 02:12:09.529]  Come on, let's go!
[02:12:09.529 --> 02:12:11.429]  Come on, come on, come on, let's go!
[02:12:11.429 --> 02:12:16.271]  The Democrats aren't playing strangleholds, saying come on up, come on up, let's go, let's go!
[02:12:16.271 --> 02:12:19.953]  Because they want you literally on their plantation.
[02:12:19.953 --> 02:12:20.553]  Let's go to this club.
[02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:31.125]  We talked about ways to improve distressed communities throughout this country.
[02:12:31.125 --> 02:12:37.950]  52 million Americans living in distressed communities, and we talked about legislation that can move those communities forward.
[02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:38.871]  God please, Trump.
[02:12:38.871 --> 02:12:40.452]  And you said yes.
[02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:54.583]  As a part of this tax reform package, the Investing and Opportunity Act has been included, which will bring trillions of dollars into poor communities because of your willingness to listen.
[02:13:03.629 --> 02:13:12.191]  President said I only have about 45 more minutes, so I'm gonna get to mine.
[02:13:12.191 --> 02:13:13.152]  He didn't say that.
[02:13:13.152 --> 02:13:14.972]  Okay, got it.
[02:13:14.972 --> 02:13:21.354]  Let me just say to those Americans who are watching this process, this is not about Washington.
[02:13:21.354 --> 02:13:24.334]  It's not about the left.
[02:13:24.334 --> 02:13:26.475]  It's not about the right.
[02:13:26.475 --> 02:13:29.516]  It's about single parent moms.
[02:13:30.885 --> 02:13:34.390]  We're looking for a reason to be hopeful in 2018.
[02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:42.542]  This tax reform plan delivers for the average single mother a 70% tax cut.
[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:55.307]  For the average family who's working paycheck to paycheck, looking for ways to be hopeful about their future.
[02:13:55.307 --> 02:13:59.009]  To have an extra night for dinner out at a restaurant.
[02:13:59.009 --> 02:14:03.913]  This tax reform package cuts their taxes by nearly 60%.
[02:14:06.475 --> 02:14:21.819]  And because of folks like Marco Rubio and Ivanka, when you think about the folks with kids in the household, this plan doubles the child tax credit and makes about 70% of it refundable.
[02:14:21.819 --> 02:14:28.701]  This is a plan that we can be proud of because it speaks to the hearts of everyday Americans.
[02:14:28.701 --> 02:14:32.702]  But it's not, the poor workers shouldn't even be paying any taxes.
[02:14:32.702 --> 02:14:34.123]  Trump trying to get rid of it.
[02:14:34.123 --> 02:14:35.183]  Okay, they shouldn't be paying anything.
[02:14:36.018 --> 02:14:39.160]  Because our taxes are already low, but they need it all back.
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:43.623]  It's the middle class tax cuts that are going to surge.
[02:14:43.623 --> 02:14:46.485]  7.3 to 10.1, they're saying, most analysts.
[02:14:46.485 --> 02:14:48.767]  I mean, this is explosive growth.
[02:14:48.767 --> 02:14:53.230]  Real growth, not fake communist Chinese growth, where it all goes to, you know, a couple hundred generals.
[02:14:53.230 --> 02:14:56.473]  We're going to talk about all this on the other side, but this is just massive.
[02:14:57.924 --> 02:15:05.590]  And I just think about the fact that Trump, at that very same podium at the Capitol just 11 months ago, committed to do so much.
[02:15:05.590 --> 02:15:07.071]  TPP killing and all of it.
[02:15:07.071 --> 02:15:08.973]  He did it.
[02:15:08.973 --> 02:15:11.055]  So that's there again.
[02:15:11.055 --> 02:15:16.699]  So the President at the Capitol, he was at the White House then, but I mean, it's just right there in that very same area, committing to do it.
[02:15:16.699 --> 02:15:19.041]  I was just right down below when he did it.
[02:15:19.041 --> 02:15:19.661]  And I knew it.
[02:15:19.661 --> 02:15:19.982]  I knew it.
[02:15:19.982 --> 02:15:21.703]  My gut, my instinct said, this is real.
[02:15:21.703 --> 02:15:22.183]  It's happening.
[02:15:22.183 --> 02:15:22.764]  And it's happened.
[02:15:24.008 --> 02:15:24.688]  It's not perfect.
[02:15:24.688 --> 02:15:26.489]  It's a bloody war, but it's in the right direction.
[02:15:26.489 --> 02:15:28.770]  It's got the globalists scared.
[02:15:28.770 --> 02:15:30.751]  Free shipping store-wide continues.

[02:19:38.461 --> 02:19:47.647]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:19:47.647 --> 02:19:52.090]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:19:57.613 --> 02:20:07.117]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:07.117 --> 02:20:09.598]  Crucified for no sins.
[02:20:16.721 --> 02:20:21.085]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:20:21.085 --> 02:20:23.427]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:43.345 --> 02:20:52.127]  Ted Malek was former board member of the Davos Group, of course, former head of the Aspen Institute, one of the top-level organizations, but he's always been a patriot.
[02:20:52.127 --> 02:20:54.308]  I've gone back to writings he did 25 years ago.
[02:20:54.308 --> 02:21:01.650]  I'm not going to get into all his PhDs, International Political Economy, and he's also got degrees, you know, dealing with religion.
[02:21:01.650 --> 02:21:03.211]  But that's why it's important to get him on.
[02:21:03.211 --> 02:21:07.672]  He's worked in Capital Markets with Salomon Brothers and served as senior policy positions in the U.S.
[02:21:07.672 --> 02:21:09.552]  Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the U.S.
[02:21:09.552 --> 02:21:10.212]  State Department.
[02:21:10.212 --> 02:21:11.113]  I'm not going to get into all that.
[02:21:12.915 --> 02:21:18.336]  The reason I got him on last time, I wanted to get into the occult obsessions of some of the globalists.
[02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:18.976]  He wasn't ready.
[02:21:18.976 --> 02:21:19.956]  He said, yeah, it goes on.
[02:21:19.956 --> 02:21:23.797]  But he said, let me just think about what I'm willing to get into, and then I'll talk about it.
[02:21:23.797 --> 02:21:27.478]  Because I've been involved some with Hollywood and some with stuff in the UK.
[02:21:27.478 --> 02:21:29.558]  And they're like, why don't you come to the Hellfire Club?
[02:21:29.558 --> 02:21:30.958]  And it's like major directors and people.
[02:21:30.958 --> 02:21:33.619]  And we're going to go in these catacombs, and it's like eyes wide shut.
[02:21:33.619 --> 02:21:34.439]  And why don't you do it?
[02:21:34.439 --> 02:21:34.939]  You're in the club.
[02:21:34.939 --> 02:21:35.459]  I'm like, no.
[02:21:35.459 --> 02:21:36.399]  So I never did it all.
[02:21:36.399 --> 02:21:37.840]  And I'm sure Ted hasn't either.
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:41.783]  The point is not that I'm scared of it.
[02:21:41.783 --> 02:21:44.087]  I just like going crazy.
[02:21:44.087 --> 02:21:49.175]  I'm scared of like people just being involved in all that stuff because then it leads to other things.
[02:21:49.175 --> 02:21:51.338]  You know, like killing somebody at the end of the night or whatever.
[02:21:51.338 --> 02:21:54.703]  So Ted Malik's here to break it all down, but he wanted to get into
[02:21:55.484 --> 02:22:02.629]  There's prolific articles that are published all over the place from, you name it, World Net Daily to InfoWars to big establishment publications.
[02:22:02.629 --> 02:22:06.792]  But US tax reform breaks global rules, says EU.
[02:22:06.792 --> 02:22:09.213]  That's out of DW.com, big German news.
[02:22:09.213 --> 02:22:11.635]  They admit it's going to move jobs back to the US.
[02:22:11.635 --> 02:22:13.416]  We have secret combines with you.
[02:22:13.416 --> 02:22:13.916]  We have agreements.
[02:22:13.916 --> 02:22:15.057]  You're not supposed to do it.
[02:22:15.057 --> 02:22:17.639]  Germany demands UK's unconditional surrender on Brexit.
[02:22:17.639 --> 02:22:19.200]  That's dead melon.
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:23.043]  Trump's top EU pick warns German media of seismic shift in ties.
[02:22:23.883 --> 02:22:25.304]  So here's the World End Daily article.
[02:22:25.304 --> 02:22:30.929]  Let's revisit the Podesta Pigeon for pedophilic, cannibalistic, and satanic art.
[02:22:30.929 --> 02:22:42.079]  Which we can say, okay, not the pizza place, that's how they diverted us off into that, but them themselves and the WikiLeaks, which we're ready to really release some big stuff on very soon.
[02:22:42.659 --> 02:22:44.220]  There's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes.
[02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:46.000]  So Ted Malek joins us now.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:47.401]  I want to give him the floor.
[02:22:47.401 --> 02:22:51.662]  We don't do pre-interviews, and I haven't talked to him since he visited the studio a few weeks ago in Austin.
[02:22:51.662 --> 02:22:57.544]  Where do you want to start with that palette that you kind of laid out, a few little pieces of blobs of paint I put there.
[02:22:57.544 --> 02:22:59.045]  Where do you want to go first?
[02:22:59.045 --> 02:23:03.527]  I think there are some, we have some time, so we have some linkages.
[02:23:03.527 --> 02:23:09.569]  The EU is part of, of course, the globalist empire, the New World Order.
[02:23:10.633 --> 02:23:16.017]  Uh, and I think that many of its origins are, in fact, quite evil.
[02:23:16.017 --> 02:23:18.659]  And I think we should talk about that.
[02:23:18.659 --> 02:23:30.868]  I've written about it in this letter where I describe the unconditional surrender that Germany is demanding of Britain, of the UK during the Brexit negotiations.
[02:23:30.868 --> 02:23:39.615]  It's basically a German takeover of Europe, making Europe into its own puppet state with its crony capitalism and its fake currency, the euro.
[02:23:40.512 --> 02:23:56.285]  But what I really want to do after our conversation just a few weeks ago in studio is come back to this question that you asked me that I was unprepared for because, you know, sometimes it's uncomfortable, particularly at this time of year.
[02:23:56.285 --> 02:23:59.988]  But I want to talk about it, and that is Luciferianism.
[02:23:59.988 --> 02:24:07.935]  Luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer.
[02:24:07.935 --> 02:24:08.616]  That tradition
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:21.346]  has been informed by Gnosticism, by Satanism, and it usually refers to Lucifer, not as the devil per se, but as some kind of liberator, some kind of guardian, some kind of guiding spirit.
[02:24:21.346 --> 02:24:24.968]  In fact, it's the true God, as opposed to Jehovah.
[02:24:24.968 --> 02:24:37.374]  And I think many people in Europe, particularly in the hierarchy, are of the same opinion as some of the top people who get this in the Democratic Party in the United States.
[02:24:37.374 --> 02:24:37.794]  And this
[02:24:38.863 --> 02:24:48.750]  Satanic to his Luciferian orientation is really this creation of a fallen angel.
[02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:50.731]  Of course, we know who Lucifer is.
[02:24:50.731 --> 02:25:00.057]  And he's seen as one of the morning stars, as a symbol of enlightenment, as a kind of independence, and of true human progress.
[02:25:00.057 --> 02:25:04.180]  Turning away from God and turning to Lucifer in order to enlighten yourself.
[02:25:04.770 --> 02:25:08.991]  So I did a little research on this, and you'll find this very interesting.
[02:25:08.991 --> 02:25:33.097]  In his very famous 1971 book, which was his final book, Rules for Radicals, the very prominent American community organizer on the far left, Saul Alinsky, wrote at the end of his acknowledgments to that book, and I want to quote this, lest we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgment
[02:25:42.073 --> 02:25:43.353]  Which is which?
[02:25:43.353 --> 02:25:56.817]  The first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he has won his own kingdom was Lucifer.
[02:25:56.817 --> 02:26:02.479]  Saul Alinsky dedicating Rules to Radical to his hero, Lucifer.
[02:26:05.492 --> 02:26:11.438]  And of course, that's him in public just saying, oh, I do this kind of in a, you know, a little cheechy way or whatever.
[02:26:11.438 --> 02:26:16.143]  But when you get down to brass tacks, these people really believe they're setting themselves up as God.
[02:26:16.143 --> 02:26:20.627]  And they advertise, just like during the French Revolution, the false revolution, the Jacobin
[02:26:21.468 --> 02:26:25.709]  System versus our real revolution that they want to become God.
[02:26:25.709 --> 02:26:29.770]  They want absolute power and he writes about it the book He believes in nothing but absolute power.
[02:26:29.770 --> 02:26:50.656]  This is so creepy This is the opposite of chivalry the opposite of Christ the opposite of Jehovah That's what it is we're talking about the Antichrist we're talking about the fallen angel but for these people turning their you know their face against the true God they're turning to this warm and
[02:26:51.224 --> 02:26:51.425]  All right.
[02:27:03.174 --> 02:27:06.536]  And we can get into John Podesta and his emails, which... We will.
[02:27:06.536 --> 02:27:08.638]  We'll do that next, because we're on a break.
[02:27:08.638 --> 02:27:13.901]  But truly, whether you're an atheist or not, they believe in the archetype as an operating system, like a program.
[02:27:13.901 --> 02:27:15.102]  You look at what they did to Russia.
[02:27:15.102 --> 02:27:19.005]  I mean, they tried this whole Luciferian operation there.
[02:27:19.005 --> 02:27:19.965]  They are so angry.
[02:27:19.965 --> 02:27:22.387]  I've talked to folks high level in Hollywood and other areas.
[02:27:22.387 --> 02:27:24.828]  They're mad that Russia is truly becoming Christian.
[02:27:24.828 --> 02:27:26.129]  It's literally spiritual.
[02:27:26.129 --> 02:27:29.652]  They are so angry.
[02:27:29.652 --> 02:27:30.873]  Well, they have to...
[02:27:32.142 --> 02:27:41.153]  Obviously feel very annoyed by any people, any person, any community, any nation that turns their hearts back to God.
[02:27:41.153 --> 02:27:45.858]  And there's increasing evidence that lots of people in Russia are doing that.
[02:27:45.858 --> 02:27:47.961]  Obviously since that was impossible during the
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:55.740]  We're good to go.
[02:28:24.297 --> 02:28:29.600]  That's right.
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:33.822]  They say they want to play all religions off against each other until nothing's left but Lucifer.
[02:28:33.822 --> 02:28:35.323]  We're going to come back again.
[02:28:35.323 --> 02:28:51.272]  I know you're going to get into this as a theologian, you have a degree in, but I want to get into specifically, I know you don't get into private stuff that happens behind closed doors, just as I, as a journalist, sometimes in confidence, I can't talk about it, but in general, the spirit of Lucifer, the attitude, the psychopathic culture.

[02:33:15.979 --> 02:33:20.146]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:20.146 --> 02:33:28.098]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.098 --> 02:33:30.501]  Humanity faces incredible challenges.
[02:33:32.526 --> 02:33:36.528]  Only being aware of it can save us.
[02:33:36.528 --> 02:33:41.510]  A globalist, the head of one of the, he wasn't the head of the big three, he was the head of the fourth largest bank in the U.S.
[02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:42.731]  at the time.
[02:33:42.731 --> 02:33:51.255]  Again, I flew to be on The View years ago, it's like six, seven years ago now, and I sat down next to him, I recognized him a little bit from watching financial shows.
[02:33:51.255 --> 02:33:52.455]  He wasn't a guest, but you'd seen him.
[02:33:52.455 --> 02:33:56.197]  And he figured out who I was real quick, because folks were shaking my hand.
[02:33:56.197 --> 02:33:59.859]  And he was telling me he was visiting his dad, who was a retired general in San Antonio.
[02:34:00.993 --> 02:34:10.715]  He just, after about a three hour conversation, by the way, he got up in a perfect suit after being on the plane and got his, you know, trench coat out, hair perfect, everything.
[02:34:10.715 --> 02:34:11.775]  And he says, they're all about that.
[02:34:11.775 --> 02:34:23.258]  And he goes, as the plane's landing, he goes, Alex, you think people are going to adapt and overcome the Marine Corps term, improvise, overcome, adapt, overcome.
[02:34:23.258 --> 02:34:24.338]  You don't get it.
[02:34:24.338 --> 02:34:26.378]  That's what you're going to do.
[02:34:26.378 --> 02:34:29.439]  The general public is going to adapt to being in this system.
[02:34:31.135 --> 02:34:32.996]  And he laughed at me.
[02:34:32.996 --> 02:34:40.099]  And I said to him, once he did his thing and turned, getting his jacket out, because he waited to say it after he listened to me for like an hour on the plane.
[02:34:40.099 --> 02:34:44.201]  We didn't talk the first few hours.
[02:34:44.201 --> 02:34:45.422]  At first, he's like looking over at me.
[02:34:45.422 --> 02:34:49.043]  I'm sitting right next to him, American Airlines.
[02:34:49.043 --> 02:34:51.124]  And he wanted to have his piece to be done.
[02:34:51.124 --> 02:34:54.766]  And I said, listen, I can't bet against humanity and want to live.
[02:34:57.017 --> 02:34:59.800]  And his back was turning, he shuddered.
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:03.424]  And it was that point, like, I'm not giving my soul up.
[02:35:03.424 --> 02:35:04.926]  I get the public's dumbed down.
[02:35:04.926 --> 02:35:06.127]  I get they'll tear me apart.
[02:35:06.127 --> 02:35:08.090]  I get it, you've made them into a weapon.
[02:35:08.090 --> 02:35:10.933]  The point is, I can't feel big while they're little.
[02:35:10.933 --> 02:35:13.416]  I don't want to join you and look down on the slaves.
[02:35:13.416 --> 02:35:14.697]  Don't you get it?
[02:35:14.697 --> 02:35:17.480]  Doesn't mean if somebody tries to destroy me, I won't rip their head off.
[02:35:18.456 --> 02:35:20.678]  The difference is I'm not out to get people.
[02:35:20.678 --> 02:35:22.120]  It's not like I'm some saint.
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:25.303]  You people virtue signal all day because you have no virtue.
[02:35:25.303 --> 02:35:26.364]  And studies show that.
[02:35:26.364 --> 02:35:29.107]  The average liberal is... I always slip the numbers.
[02:35:29.107 --> 02:35:30.288]  It's in a bunch of British and U.S.
[02:35:30.288 --> 02:35:31.309]  studies and Canadian.
[02:35:31.309 --> 02:35:35.434]  But on average it's, what, six times more likely to lie.
[02:35:37.737 --> 02:35:40.440]  Nine times more likely to steal, or is it vice versa?
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:42.322]  Because they're not real liberals.
[02:35:42.322 --> 02:35:43.463]  And they've changed all the terms.
[02:35:43.463 --> 02:35:45.645]  So Ted Malik, you've got the floor of the segment I'm ranting.
[02:35:45.645 --> 02:35:50.250]  TedMalik.com, got your new book out, Secrets of Business, where you really tell folks what's going on.
[02:35:50.250 --> 02:35:53.393]  Again, former board member of the Davos Group, so much more.
[02:35:53.393 --> 02:35:57.918]  Major envoy of the Senate Government, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S.
[02:35:57.918 --> 02:35:58.438]  State Department.
[02:35:59.179 --> 02:36:00.900]  Big insider, but he's been a patriot.
[02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:01.700]  Not a bad guy.
[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:02.940]  Not everybody on the inside is bad.
[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:04.881]  The point is you've got to track where you're exposing it.
[02:36:04.881 --> 02:36:06.242]  You're getting into Luciferianism.
[02:36:06.242 --> 02:36:07.642]  You're getting into their worldview.
[02:36:07.642 --> 02:36:09.163]  You're getting into who they are.
[02:36:09.163 --> 02:36:10.383]  Where are we historically?
[02:36:10.383 --> 02:36:12.284]  What is this obsession with Lucifer?
[02:36:12.284 --> 02:36:13.064]  What are we facing?
[02:36:16.676 --> 02:36:17.917]  I think he has a light on the sky.
[02:36:17.917 --> 02:36:18.157]  Go ahead.
[02:36:36.405 --> 02:36:41.568]  Very involved in international organizations, all kinds of deals, the Clinton Foundation.
[02:36:41.568 --> 02:36:59.215]  If you look at his emails, now the public can for the first time actually look at these emails, thanks to WikiLeaks, and you can see the references that he made over and over again to Luciferianism, and this is abhorrent, also to sexual abuse, abuse of children by himself.
[02:36:59.215 --> 02:37:05.258]  He uses code words such as cheese, which means little girl, pasta, which means little boy,
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:18.065]  And he uses them over and over again, these code words, on the deep web pediophile messaging boards, the emails, and there are many of them.
[02:37:18.065 --> 02:37:19.866]  Your viewers can go look at them.
[02:37:19.866 --> 02:37:21.727]  They're available online.
[02:37:21.727 --> 02:37:29.992]  They prove that he is involved, very deeply involved, as a committed Luciferian.
[02:37:29.992 --> 02:37:35.576]  Among other things, it's his invitation by Marina Abramovitz to
[02:37:40.011 --> 02:37:41.771]  I think proves the most revealing.
[02:37:41.771 --> 02:37:52.494]  Now, for the European... By the way, that was invented by Aleister Crowley, reportedly the most evil man alive, reportedly sacrificed his own son.
[02:37:52.494 --> 02:37:53.114]  Precisely.
[02:37:53.114 --> 02:38:04.277]  This is a ritual, a specific ritual, in which participants use the vilest human body fluids in order to summon spiritual energies for assistance and favor.
[02:38:05.327 --> 02:38:15.898]  And to any sane person, this sounds completely ludicrous, but to a Luciferian, this is the practice of enlightenment.
[02:38:15.898 --> 02:38:18.080]  It's something that initiates them.
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:21.104]  It's something that they understand that they have to do.
[02:38:21.104 --> 02:38:25.929]  It lowers their humanity to a low enough level to be possessed by this evil force.
[02:38:28.399 --> 02:38:29.680]  That's the whole idea.
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:32.541]  To be possessed by Lucifer himself.
[02:38:32.541 --> 02:38:42.507]  And these practices of a Luciferian religion and anti-Christianity are, I would argue, the absolute inversion of Christianity.
[02:38:42.507 --> 02:38:46.169]  As he says in the emails, come, we have blood, we have semen.
[02:38:46.169 --> 02:38:50.431]  And this is what they use Pizzagate to divert off to some pizza store that the media all covered.
[02:38:50.431 --> 02:38:52.472]  We covered it and they claim we were part of it.
[02:38:52.472 --> 02:38:54.793]  Again, this is what they're pouring out.
[02:38:54.793 --> 02:38:55.534]  This is unbelievable.
[02:38:56.254 --> 02:38:59.015]  You're showing the real thing on the screen.
[02:38:59.015 --> 02:39:00.675]  We've had Black Masses.
[02:39:00.675 --> 02:39:07.597]  We know about those things.
[02:39:07.597 --> 02:39:10.058]  You know, Holy Eucharist, the Mass.
[02:39:10.058 --> 02:39:14.439]  We also have cannibalism and pedophilia.
[02:39:14.439 --> 02:39:15.599]  These are highlights.
[02:39:15.599 --> 02:39:19.461]  These are common practices, actually, amongst Luciferians.
[02:39:19.461 --> 02:39:24.262]  And this makes, I think, Podesta's choice of paintings in his own office
[02:39:25.482 --> 02:39:27.344]  All the more revealing.
[02:39:27.344 --> 02:39:33.808]  The paintings in his office, and we actually have photos of those as well, are very disturbing.
[02:39:33.808 --> 02:39:36.990]  They depict cannibals.
[02:39:36.990 --> 02:39:51.200]  And when asked in an interview by the, you know, the political magazine Politico about the paintings, Podesta replied that it's better to be the guy with the fork rather than the guy on the table.
[02:39:53.092 --> 02:39:56.596]  This is the guy that was leading the Democratic Party.
[02:39:56.596 --> 02:40:07.409]  This is a shot of what looks like eight-year-old girls begging not to be gang-raped in a shower with, I guess, like stuff to tie them up to the ceiling.
[02:40:07.409 --> 02:40:10.232]  They would tweet photos of dungeons and things.
[02:40:10.232 --> 02:40:12.995]  And then again, I didn't realize what was happening at the time when
[02:40:12.995 --> 02:40:17.938]  And Washington Post, New York Times, CNN all focus on a pizza place instead of the emails in New York.
[02:40:17.938 --> 02:40:20.100]  We covered the pizza place, covered the rumors.
[02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:21.761]  Then they said we created it.
[02:40:21.761 --> 02:40:29.266]  And then I had a crazy woman and a bunch of Democrats attack me literally at a restaurant the other night screaming, do you screw your baby?
[02:40:29.266 --> 02:40:30.246]  We're going to get you.
[02:40:30.246 --> 02:40:31.467]  Screw your baby.
[02:40:31.467 --> 02:40:33.889]  And the whole family was just like, I've got video of it.
[02:40:33.889 --> 02:40:35.030]  I haven't put it out yet.
[02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:36.230]  Yeah, this is Podesta's art.
[02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:37.811]  Chained up little children.
[02:40:37.811 --> 02:40:38.051]  I know.
[02:40:38.051 --> 02:40:39.032]  And they're so foolish.
[02:40:40.413 --> 02:40:42.133]  So, I mean, what kind of people are we dealing with?
[02:40:42.133 --> 02:40:43.014]  What kind of leaders are we dealing with?
[02:41:09.424 --> 02:41:15.046]  If these are their deepest spiritual sentiments and practices... Chained up children!
[02:41:15.046 --> 02:41:17.927]  I apologize, go ahead.
[02:41:17.927 --> 02:41:23.089]  Give them any kind of respect, any kind of accord, let alone think of them for public office.
[02:41:23.089 --> 02:41:24.889]  I mean, it's beyond detestable.
[02:41:24.889 --> 02:41:28.631]  It is actually radical evil.
[02:41:28.631 --> 02:41:29.331]  Please continue.
[02:41:31.621 --> 02:41:52.135]  Well, I actually think that we have to expose this, Alex, where it exists, to the degree it exists, the fact that it exists at the top of our government, that it in fact exists at the top of our national organization, that it's rampant throughout Europe, that it's at the heart of the European Union.
[02:41:52.135 --> 02:41:53.556]  Stay right there, stay right there.
[02:41:53.556 --> 02:41:56.517]  I don't want to do conspiracies, but you've been on Skype many times, no problem.
[02:41:56.517 --> 02:41:56.738]  It is.
[02:41:57.378 --> 02:41:58.479]  Hammered.
[02:41:58.479 --> 02:42:00.520]  And maybe we should call you on the phone.
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:01.841]  We'll have video, but you with the phone.
[02:42:01.841 --> 02:42:05.023]  And we're going to have to go into the next hour to finish this, because I want you to repeat all this.
[02:42:05.023 --> 02:42:06.324]  It's too critical.
[02:42:06.324 --> 02:42:10.007]  And the media will play clips and, you know, make fun of the sound and say, you know, whatever.
[02:42:10.007 --> 02:42:18.693]  But that's why they've got front page articles in Daily Beast, BuzzFeed, all of them with me and UFOs.
[02:42:18.693 --> 02:42:20.294]  I don't even cover UFOs.
[02:42:20.294 --> 02:42:25.538]  It's trying to desperately inoculate people that we're kooks, when all we're showing you is Podesta's
[02:42:26.710 --> 02:42:32.213]  Public art that has children chained up in dungeons.
[02:42:32.213 --> 02:42:42.899]  And again, his brother is in emails, and they say, sir, we will have the children for you tonight, ages 7, 9, 11, in the hot tub.
[02:42:42.899 --> 02:42:45.760]  They're ready to service you.
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:46.761]  And he says, are they really good?
[02:42:46.761 --> 02:42:47.981]  They said, yes.
[02:42:47.981 --> 02:42:49.682]  They said, we will have the children for you in the hot tub.
[02:42:49.682 --> 02:42:51.883]  I mean, they're sending this over email, man.
[02:42:51.883 --> 02:42:52.564]  God Almighty.
[02:42:57.088 --> 02:43:01.759]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:43:01.759 --> 02:43:03.282]  Op-op-op-op-optimum levels.
[02:43:04.329 --> 02:43:08.992]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:43:08.992 --> 02:43:11.313]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:43:11.313 --> 02:43:13.094]  B vitamins we need every day.
[02:43:13.094 --> 02:43:18.377]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[02:43:18.377 --> 02:43:20.658]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[02:43:20.658 --> 02:43:26.321]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[02:43:26.321 --> 02:43:26.721]  Secret 12.
[02:43:26.721 --> 02:43:27.722]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:43:27.862 --> 02:43:28.182]  I think so.

[02:46:20.399 --> 02:46:40.061]  My favorite new one is the don't tread on me but said it says won't tread on me and it's a big Dayglo snake Gadsden snake and then it's got the American flag Infowars.com on the right arm I mean that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech and the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt

[02:47:17.819 --> 02:47:23.045]  Consciousness, free will, only God gives it.
[02:47:23.045 --> 02:47:27.090]  The devil seeks to steal it.
[02:47:27.090 --> 02:47:29.392]  The devil can't build, only we can.
[02:47:29.392 --> 02:47:33.377]  We're God's builders, God's nanotech.
[02:47:34.909 --> 02:47:38.211]  Tiny, small compared to God, but still part of God.
[02:47:38.211 --> 02:47:42.513]  An extension, like God's hand stretched out across space-time.
[02:47:42.513 --> 02:47:47.696]  A finger, like that Sistine Chapel painting.
[02:47:47.696 --> 02:47:52.458]  Ted Malek, globalist, insider, not a globalist, is our guest.
[02:47:52.458 --> 02:47:56.521]  He's gonna recap his critical information.
[02:47:56.521 --> 02:47:56.961]  But first,
[02:47:59.195 --> 02:48:05.263]  Let's hear Donald Trump pledging what he is now, one year in, already delivered.
[02:48:05.263 --> 02:48:06.665]  Here it is.
[02:48:06.665 --> 02:48:08.488]  We're going to win so much!

[02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:11.792]  We're going to win economically!
[02:48:11.792 --> 02:48:13.575]  We're going to win with the economy!
[02:48:13.575 --> 02:48:14.937]  We're going to win with military!
[02:48:15.157 --> 02:48:17.679]  We're going to win with healthcare and for our veterans.
[02:48:17.679 --> 02:48:20.341]  We're going to win with every single facet.
[02:48:20.341 --> 02:48:24.104]  We're going to win so much, you may even get tired of winning.
[02:48:24.104 --> 02:48:27.947]  And you'll say, please, please, it's too much winning.
[02:48:27.947 --> 02:48:29.348]  We can't take it anymore.
[02:48:29.348 --> 02:48:32.030]  Mr. President, it's too much.
[02:48:32.030 --> 02:48:33.592]  And I'll say, no, it isn't.
[02:48:33.592 --> 02:48:35.033]  We have to keep winning.
[02:48:35.033 --> 02:48:36.674]  We have to win more.
[02:48:36.674 --> 02:48:38.095]  We're going to win more.
[02:48:38.095 --> 02:48:39.837]  We're going to win so much.
[02:48:39.837 --> 02:48:41.338]  I love you, Albany.
[02:48:41.338 --> 02:48:42.399]  Get out and vote.
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:44.602]  How can he say that?
[02:48:44.602 --> 02:48:54.398]  Because if the boat's tied to the dock, and he just needs to take the rope off, they've already parlayed our power to build up the world, but not for the people, for the globalists.
[02:48:54.398 --> 02:48:55.520]  Then he already knows.
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:56.982]  All he's got to do is untie it.
[02:48:56.982 --> 02:48:57.583]  He knows!
[02:48:59.039 --> 02:49:02.460]  We get this done, it works, because we already know the economics.
[02:49:02.460 --> 02:49:05.321]  Ted Malek, take over my friend for the nine minutes we've got in this segment.
[02:49:05.321 --> 02:49:06.681]  We'll hold over the next hour.
[02:49:06.681 --> 02:49:09.022]  I know you had some Skype problems, never had before, but it's happening.
[02:49:09.022 --> 02:49:14.264]  As you break, as a big insider, you're not talking about what you saw inside, not breaking any confidences.
[02:49:14.264 --> 02:49:17.224]  You're only exposing what is in public domain.
[02:49:17.224 --> 02:49:18.825]  Recap everything you said, my friend.
[02:49:18.825 --> 02:49:19.465]  You have a lot of courage.
[02:49:19.465 --> 02:49:20.885]  Go ahead.
[02:49:20.885 --> 02:49:25.887]  Well, we were talking about Luciferianism, about its origins, and Gnosticism.
[02:49:27.167 --> 02:49:46.503]  In, you know, in antique history, what it amounts to, it's anti-christian orientation, but more specifically, for the last few minutes, we've been talking about the head of the Democrat Party, the head of the Clinton campaign, a number of people in that organization who worship Lucifer, and what that means.
[02:49:46.503 --> 02:49:52.288]  In their emails, officially, in their emails, officially, world.net.com article, please continue.
[02:49:52.288 --> 02:49:55.711]  We can't make this stuff up, I mean, it's just too grotesque.
[02:49:56.543 --> 02:50:13.875]  But we also can look at the paintings that they have in their offices, the pedophilia that they practice, the spirit cooking that they become involved in, and the whole nature of their enlightenment and what that means.
[02:50:13.875 --> 02:50:22.321]  And we actually also pointed out that Saul Alinsky, in his original book for radicals, pointed to the same tradition, to Lucifer.
[02:50:22.321 --> 02:50:25.704]  So this is part of the left, it's part of a turning away.
[02:50:26.607 --> 02:50:28.068]  You're correct, philologically.
[02:50:41.539 --> 02:50:49.546]  Well, what I really want to talk about, because this is dark and it's evil and it upsets me and my wife no end, even.
[02:50:49.546 --> 02:50:55.171]  Well, let's just say, this is a big deal to have somebody like you that's been in these circles at the highest levels.
[02:50:55.171 --> 02:50:56.812]  This is a big deal, a lot of courage.
[02:50:56.812 --> 02:50:59.655]  I know you're not going to say it yourself, but this is a big deal, so go ahead.
[02:51:00.461 --> 02:51:05.082]  Well, I also taught at Yale Divinity School as well as Yale School of Management.
[02:51:05.082 --> 02:51:07.263]  I've been in major universities.
[02:51:07.263 --> 02:51:09.503]  I am not making this stuff up.
[02:51:09.503 --> 02:51:11.964]  I have the academic credentials.
[02:51:11.964 --> 02:51:19.626]  I understand its depths, but I also realize we're talking here about something that is radically evil.
[02:51:19.626 --> 02:51:21.626]  It is anti-Christian.
[02:51:21.626 --> 02:51:29.228]  So what we have to do is expose it for what it is, and we have to point it out, and I think the public will rebuke it.
[02:51:32.108 --> 02:51:35.250]  Well, just continue breaking this down.
[02:51:35.250 --> 02:51:43.716]  Well, I think that what I'd like to do instead is talk about our own tradition, because after all, it is Christmas.
[02:51:43.716 --> 02:51:44.977]  Exactly.
[02:51:44.977 --> 02:51:47.259]  That's the theme without us even saying it.
[02:51:47.259 --> 02:51:48.460]  We know the evil.
[02:51:48.460 --> 02:51:55.485]  Let's celebrate the light right now and the beauty that truly despairs, that truly drives off the dark.
[02:51:55.485 --> 02:51:59.268]  You know, we gave five minutes or ten minutes to this very radical and dark
[02:52:00.579 --> 02:52:05.161]  Let's put the bright light on our own tradition, the real root of our being.
[02:52:05.161 --> 02:52:09.763]  And Christian thinking, which is rooted in the New Testament, of course, and the wonderful insights of St.
[02:52:09.763 --> 02:52:18.666]  Paul, actually have great relevance to us as people, not least of all because it's an attempt to spell out in very detailed terms
[02:52:19.326 --> 02:52:32.229]  Exactly what it means to live in the belief that the world is ordered, that it's ordered by a loving God, that He demands love from each one of us, not only towards Himself, but also towards our neighbors.
[02:52:32.229 --> 02:52:42.232]  And at Christmas, and I'm reflecting on this, my family's coming home tomorrow, flying in from all over the world, we especially need to reflect on what
[02:52:47.757 --> 02:52:52.338]  Again, that has shaped our Western culture, that we cannot give up.
[02:52:52.338 --> 02:52:59.941]  We have to pray for those countries like Poland and Hungary, where they're actually battling the European Union over this very culture right now.
[02:52:59.941 --> 02:53:06.043]  And this whole concept of charity as love to which we are commanded, to use the original term.
[02:53:06.043 --> 02:53:10.144]  So, this giving, which is of course part of the Christmas tradition,
[02:53:10.939 --> 02:53:13.020]  We all have these gifts under our tree.
[02:53:13.020 --> 02:53:14.581]  We've all purchased these items.
[02:53:14.581 --> 02:53:16.862]  We're all excited about the pleasure.
[02:53:16.862 --> 02:53:19.263]  It's a way of opening yourself up to the other.
[02:53:19.263 --> 02:53:21.324]  It's an invitation to friendship.
[02:53:21.324 --> 02:53:22.184]  It's very exciting.
[02:53:22.184 --> 02:53:26.026]  It's also very much a part of the American tradition.
[02:53:26.026 --> 02:53:33.689]  If you think about it, Americans are really defined, I would say, in many ways by their generosity, by their volunteering.
[02:53:33.689 --> 02:53:40.572]  I mean, when de Tocqueville came to America, you know, 180 years ago, what he found across the entire
[02:53:56.954 --> 02:54:16.788]  They carry out all the family functions, they carry out the charity, they carry out all these sacred things but then corrupt them and again they've made it all commercial to become sick there but that's just it was back when people didn't have a lot to give something was a big deal because that spirit made all this wealth now we think of nothing giving all this again they've distorted everything that's sacred.
[02:54:18.354 --> 02:54:35.040]  Indeed, and so you have, on the whole then, in socialism, and Europe is socialistic to a large extent, you have this hostility to private giving, this hostility to the notion of gift, because... Because they want to get in the middle of private association!
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:38.922]  Men and women, community, they want to get in the middle of our private associations!
[02:54:38.922 --> 02:54:41.283]  That is a cult!
[02:54:41.283 --> 02:54:46.825]  It shows no respect for private property, for industry, for wealth, and it tries to put
[02:54:47.968 --> 02:54:52.772]  This notion of equality and the state being the arbiter over and over.
[02:54:52.772 --> 02:55:05.961]  It's not surprising to me when you think of the first act of Lenin after the Bolshevik revolution in Russia was to abolish and expropriate all private charities, all gift giving.
[02:55:06.536 --> 02:55:10.480]  What happened in the Second World War when the Communists took power in Hungary?
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:16.987]  They had 10,000 religious voluntary societies in that little tiny country of 8 million people.
[02:55:16.987 --> 02:55:20.531]  Within two years, all of them were abolished.
[02:55:20.531 --> 02:55:22.834]  They stole the goodwill of the people.
[02:55:22.834 --> 02:55:24.015]  They stole the goodwill of the people.
[02:55:25.262 --> 02:55:30.246]  And this is true in Communist Party, wherever you find it, in China today.
[02:55:30.246 --> 02:55:35.431]  People have to give in secret, or they have to give at risk of imprisonment.
[02:55:35.431 --> 02:55:41.976]  They have their underground schools, their underground universities, their underground churches, underground medicine.
[02:55:41.976 --> 02:55:49.342]  And it's the heroic actions of the few that lead to that kind of wonderful shared experience of the gift.
[02:55:49.342 --> 02:55:50.443]  And here's my argument.
[02:55:51.175 --> 02:55:57.437]  I'm saying that giving is not only natural, but it's a fundamental part of moral health.
[02:55:57.437 --> 02:56:03.278]  And by giving, which is what we're doing in this season, the existence of the other is fulfilled in love.
[02:56:03.278 --> 02:56:10.520]  And this kind of gratitude is absolutely crucial to being a human being.
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:18.742]  If you read the Bible, and some people do, hopefully in church over the next few days, the first letter to the Corinthians of St.
[02:56:18.742 --> 02:56:19.902]  Paul delivers
[02:56:20.897 --> 02:56:22.158]  We're good to go.
[02:56:44.707 --> 02:56:49.149]  That's what Paul talks about in his wonderful... And it's an overwhelming spirit.
[02:56:49.149 --> 02:56:55.972]  That's why I get tears in my eyes talking about this, because it's so strong, it's so pure, it's destiny for the species.
[02:56:55.972 --> 02:57:00.234]  You can feel destiny knocking on the door.
[02:57:00.234 --> 02:57:00.574]  And St.
[02:57:00.574 --> 02:57:06.757]  Thomas Aquinas, you know, in Christian history argues that it's the fundamental gift.
[02:57:06.757 --> 02:57:12.880]  It's granted by God to himself, by his own nature, and to the world in choice.
[02:57:13.539 --> 02:57:17.521]  So it's my life, your gifts are a gift.
[02:57:17.521 --> 02:57:19.323]  Stay there, we're gonna come back.
[02:57:19.323 --> 02:57:20.103]  70 seconds, stay there.
[02:57:20.103 --> 02:57:22.625]  Two minutes now, the break's... I mean, that's it.
[02:57:22.625 --> 02:57:24.526]  Everything else is satanic it wants to hold.
[02:57:24.526 --> 02:57:27.127]  God is just giving, giving, giving, giving.
[02:57:27.127 --> 02:57:29.709]  Consciousness, everything, all the beauty, everything.
[02:57:29.709 --> 02:57:31.510]  And we're just like, bitching and complaining.
[02:57:31.510 --> 02:57:37.794]  We've been given consciousness on this star base in the middle of the galaxy with unlimited potential.
[02:57:37.794 --> 02:57:40.555]  I mean, we just... it's... thank God.
[02:57:40.555 --> 02:57:41.116]  Thank God.

[03:00:04.182 --> 03:00:12.348]  You know, Kate Steinle got shot in the back a couple years ago, and San Francisco said, well, he's an illegal alien, we gotta let him go.
[03:00:12.348 --> 03:00:13.209]  You know, he made it, he did it.
[03:00:13.689 --> 03:00:18.811]  Well, now they won't let her in San Francisco put up signs of her face saying she had dreams too.
[03:00:18.811 --> 03:00:21.091]  That video is coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:21.091 --> 03:00:23.992]  Ted Malik, again, we appreciate you joining us.
[03:00:23.992 --> 03:00:26.213]  Your new book's out about the secrets of business.
[03:00:26.213 --> 03:00:26.933]  Folks can find that.
[03:00:26.933 --> 03:00:29.994]  We sell it in fullworkstore.com, tedmalik.com.
[03:00:29.994 --> 03:00:31.134]  We've got five minutes left.
[03:00:31.134 --> 03:00:32.195]  You've got to go.
[03:00:32.195 --> 03:00:33.955]  What are other big things you want to impart?
[03:00:33.955 --> 03:00:35.856]  What do you make of the big tax victory yesterday?
[03:00:37.216 --> 03:00:38.216]  I think this is going next.
[03:00:38.216 --> 03:00:39.277]  How are they going to strike back?
[03:00:39.277 --> 03:00:44.439]  Because their Russia investigation has fallen apart, been proven inside jobs spectacularly.
[03:00:44.439 --> 03:00:45.800]  It shows how arrogant they are.
[03:00:45.800 --> 03:00:48.001]  It was so shoddy how they paid for it.
[03:00:48.001 --> 03:00:49.302]  They admit it's fake.
[03:00:49.302 --> 03:00:50.422]  I mean, they should all go to jail.
[03:00:50.422 --> 03:00:52.823]  This is crazy.
[03:00:52.823 --> 03:01:00.687]  Well, we'll have our special counsel in the new year and hopefully we can pick up all those loose ends and bring them to justice.
[03:01:00.687 --> 03:01:05.249]  I was in tears yesterday when I saw the Republican Congress on the steps
[03:01:06.047 --> 03:01:08.528]  There with the president.
[03:01:08.528 --> 03:01:11.829]  And I mean, it's just an incredible accomplishment.
[03:01:11.829 --> 03:01:17.532]  It's it's taken, you know, three decades to bring this about it.
[03:01:17.532 --> 03:01:24.835]  But the leader of this whole exercise is a person that took center stage.
[03:01:24.835 --> 03:01:31.578]  He shared the stage with many of its authors, of course, but without Donald Trump, this wouldn't have happened.
[03:01:31.578 --> 03:01:34.919]  So he also, you know, your mind you're listening to said,
[03:01:35.876 --> 03:01:37.977]  Probably a decade from the White House.
[03:01:37.977 --> 03:01:41.219]  He heard them from his own lips.
[03:01:41.219 --> 03:01:42.940]  Merry Christmas.
[03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:46.362]  Oh, they've had this war against Christmas on for
[03:02:02.441 --> 03:02:15.188]  You know, more than two decades, and Christmas has become an enormous, you know, commercial occasion now, so we've divorced it pretty much from its religious original, original, you know, context.
[03:02:15.188 --> 03:02:25.274]  So, I mean, where I want to go in this last few minutes is basically just to remind the listeners that, you know, my life, their lives, are a gift.
[03:02:25.274 --> 03:02:30.697]  And so too are the goods that come to me and you, and the gifts that we're going to have under our tree in the next few days.
[03:02:32.031 --> 03:02:34.192]  From the source that granted life.
[03:02:34.192 --> 03:02:45.459]  And once we see the world in that way, which, frankly, is the way of faith, then we see the reality of gift love and how the world is ordered, and we see its power.
[03:02:45.459 --> 03:02:51.622]  We see the chains of gifts and gratitude spread through all things.
[03:02:51.622 --> 03:02:54.484]  And it leads to our own spiritual well-being.
[03:02:54.484 --> 03:02:55.604]  And we can join to them.
[03:02:55.604 --> 03:02:57.766]  And these are not burdensome chains.
[03:02:57.766 --> 03:02:58.466]  On the contrary,
[03:02:59.272 --> 03:03:02.533]  I think their ingredients, their main ingredient is actually freedom.
[03:03:02.533 --> 03:03:07.535]  And by linking to these chains, we receive a benefit far greater than the one... Well, exactly.
[03:03:07.535 --> 03:03:11.076]  I mean, you have a child to take care of them, and they take care of you.
[03:03:11.076 --> 03:03:13.037]  Everything is symbiotic in God's plan.
[03:03:13.037 --> 03:03:19.619]  You see the incredible... It's like all these atheists, mathematicians, genetic engineers, they finally become masters.
[03:03:19.619 --> 03:03:21.180]  They go, God, there's a God.
[03:03:21.180 --> 03:03:22.740]  It all works so perfectly.
[03:03:22.740 --> 03:03:25.901]  And it couldn't just come together by itself.
[03:03:25.901 --> 03:03:27.982]  And this is the story of Christmas.
[03:03:29.116 --> 03:03:34.920]  God gave His only beloved Son so that we could have eternal life.
[03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:39.584]  And that is, of course, the greatest gift of all time.
[03:03:39.584 --> 03:03:41.565]  It's His story.
[03:03:41.565 --> 03:03:44.428]  It's the great drama of human existence.
[03:03:44.428 --> 03:03:52.173]  So, when we celebrate the Advent this year, we should remember that nativity scene.
[03:03:52.173 --> 03:03:55.616]  We need to think about that form of gift love
[03:03:56.275 --> 03:04:05.680]  Of God's grace which is bestowed on every one of us, on His creation in the first instance, but to every single one of us as human beings.
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:10.522]  And then we can have a very blessed Christmas because we can celebrate the Christ Mass.
[03:04:10.522 --> 03:04:17.845]  I explained to somebody the other day that Christmas actually means, if you can believe this, Christ's Mass.
[03:04:17.845 --> 03:04:18.326]  It does!
[03:04:18.326 --> 03:04:22.928]  It means the Mass of Christ's birth and death and risen.
[03:04:24.468 --> 03:04:25.449]  That's it.
[03:04:25.449 --> 03:04:28.892]  Christ was born in Christmas.
[03:04:28.892 --> 03:04:32.535]  He had his ministry on earth for a short period of time.
[03:04:32.535 --> 03:04:39.001]  He died and ascended into heaven, and he takes us there as our final place.
[03:04:39.001 --> 03:04:41.403]  So you have to have the whole sweep of that story.
[03:04:41.403 --> 03:04:43.945]  And if humanity makes it, we're going to the heavens.
[03:04:43.945 --> 03:04:45.446]  Ted Malek, incredible.
[03:04:45.446 --> 03:04:50.391]  It's all allegory, it's all there, it's all a transmission for us to survive if we take it.
[03:04:50.391 --> 03:04:51.071]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:51.071 --> 03:04:51.472]  We'll be back.
[03:04:52.833 --> 03:04:54.715]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:04:54.715 --> 03:04:55.936]  Go ahead.
[03:04:55.936 --> 03:04:57.878]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:04:57.878 --> 03:05:08.389]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:05:08.389 --> 03:05:11.733]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[03:05:12.213 --> 03:05:12.473]  Absolutely.
[03:05:34.673 --> 03:05:47.880]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:06:00.704 --> 03:06:02.407]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.407 --> 03:06:04.570]  We now take you live to planet Earth.
[03:06:15.504 --> 03:06:25.526]  In the desperate attempt of the species to get off world, ancient transmissions tell us if we accept the computers and merge with them, we will be destroyed forever.
[03:06:25.526 --> 03:06:32.767]  If we awaken to that program and move forward and are good people, we will go to heaven, to the stars.
[03:06:32.767 --> 03:06:39.928]  Ancients looked at that and didn't understand it, but now it makes crystal clear sense what we're dealing with.
[03:06:39.928 --> 03:06:42.949]  The heavens lie before us.
[03:06:42.949 --> 03:06:43.609]  Extended life.
[03:06:44.787 --> 03:06:46.388]  Eternal life.
[03:06:46.388 --> 03:06:48.668]  Unlimited energy.
[03:06:48.668 --> 03:06:50.869]  Unlimited information.
[03:06:50.869 --> 03:06:52.190]  Water, water everywhere.
[03:06:52.190 --> 03:06:55.751]  Not a drop to drink.
[03:06:55.751 --> 03:06:56.411]  That's where we are.
[03:06:56.411 --> 03:06:57.432]  Knowledge all around us.
[03:06:57.432 --> 03:07:02.454]  We're going to go to Anthony Comey, our host this hour, with his compoundmedia.com, doing a great job.
[03:07:02.454 --> 03:07:07.555]  But I wanted to hit this piece that's on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:07:07.555 --> 03:07:11.617]  Leftist students rip down racist Kate Stanley memorial posters.
[03:07:12.762 --> 03:07:32.888]  You know, I literally got heart palpitations, and I've never had those before, last couple weeks ago when Owen Schroer went downtown and men with guns, not guns operating their free speech or their second amendment, but men with guns
[03:07:34.693 --> 03:07:39.315]  He said, you're not going to the Capitol Rally and then blocked him and attacked him with clubs.
[03:07:39.315 --> 03:07:40.336]  And you know, he's like a patriot.
[03:07:40.336 --> 03:07:42.357]  He's like, oh, they hit me with clubs, wouldn't let me in.
[03:07:42.357 --> 03:07:43.077]  Oh, big deal.
[03:07:43.077 --> 03:07:43.958]  Hey, you guys are idiots.
[03:07:43.958 --> 03:07:46.459]  But he was assaulted.
[03:07:46.459 --> 03:07:53.842]  And the Antifa wouldn't let him get in for a Kate Stanley memorial for this poor, beautiful young woman.
[03:07:53.842 --> 03:07:55.423]  I love her.
[03:07:55.423 --> 03:07:57.664]  She's black, Hispanic, whatever.
[03:07:57.664 --> 03:07:58.345]  Shot in the back.
[03:07:59.178 --> 03:08:00.500]  With her father.
[03:08:00.500 --> 03:08:02.682]  She had dreams, too.
[03:08:02.682 --> 03:08:06.766]  And you've got this guy who's been deported five times.
[03:08:08.479 --> 03:08:10.000]  It's like the railway killer.
[03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.080]  He was deported, I forget, like 15 times.
[03:08:12.080 --> 03:08:14.341]  I think he killed like 40-something people.
[03:08:14.341 --> 03:08:16.242]  All of them were Hispanic, by the way.
[03:08:16.242 --> 03:08:20.483]  It's not that Hispanics are serial killers or have a higher indices of crime.
[03:08:20.483 --> 03:08:26.565]  It's that they can go to any country they want and governments just let them in because this globalist operation opened up the Americas.
[03:08:26.565 --> 03:08:33.808]  So this literal lunatic shoots her in the back and then the jury won't even convict him of manslaughter.
[03:08:34.639 --> 03:08:38.141]  Which would just mean, he didn't know he killed her, but still, you're liable.
[03:08:38.141 --> 03:08:40.542]  Seven years in jail, California.
[03:08:40.542 --> 03:08:41.943]  It's like that in most states.
[03:08:41.943 --> 03:08:43.144]  Serve like three years.
[03:08:43.144 --> 03:08:43.604]  Maybe two.
[03:08:43.604 --> 03:08:47.506]  If you're good behavior, maybe one.
[03:08:47.506 --> 03:08:48.767]  Federal, you serve 90%.
[03:08:48.767 --> 03:08:50.228]  State, you serve like a third.
[03:08:50.228 --> 03:08:52.289]  A half.
[03:08:52.289 --> 03:08:56.892]  There's video at the college where somebody put up, I had dreams too.
[03:08:58.448 --> 03:09:00.109]  And again, she's a white lady.
[03:09:00.109 --> 03:09:01.750]  I think she has some Hispanics in her family.
[03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:02.490]  It doesn't matter.
[03:09:02.490 --> 03:09:06.993]  Hispanics are a mix of white folks and natives and Spanish bloods of some North African.
[03:09:06.993 --> 03:09:07.994]  It doesn't matter.
[03:09:07.994 --> 03:09:08.834]  We're all humans.
[03:09:08.834 --> 03:09:10.095]  Beautiful.
[03:09:10.095 --> 03:09:11.896]  The Spanish women, all of them, beautiful.
[03:09:11.896 --> 03:09:12.676]  Everybody's beautiful.
[03:09:12.676 --> 03:09:13.797]  I love everybody.
[03:09:13.797 --> 03:09:14.778]  The point is, is that...
[03:09:16.408 --> 03:09:25.856]  She gets killed out with her daddy eating a snow cone, and the left can't even send the jerk, mentally ill, put him in a mental institution.
[03:09:25.856 --> 03:09:27.577]  They won't do anything!
[03:09:27.577 --> 03:09:34.743]  And they say, 19 people run over, one of them they say is basically dead, brain dead, and they won't even say it's a Muslim.
[03:09:34.743 --> 03:09:36.804]  They go, well, it's ISIS but it's mentally ill.
[03:09:36.804 --> 03:09:40.888]  Yeah, the Nazis were mentally ill.
[03:09:40.888 --> 03:09:44.871]  Humans go into these weird things, and you can say other cultures were mentally ill.
[03:09:46.443 --> 03:09:58.978]  So, they, they, they kill her, and then we got video at the university where they won't even let them put up signs.
[03:09:58.978 --> 03:10:04.865]  They could put up every other sign they want, kill the cops, you name it, and that's in the article, but you can't put up a sign just saying,
[03:10:06.545 --> 03:10:08.486]  She had dreams too.
[03:10:08.486 --> 03:10:11.528]  Let the students rip down racist Kate Stanley memorial posters.
[03:10:11.528 --> 03:10:13.629]  Because see, they're scared of a martyr.
[03:10:13.629 --> 03:10:17.792]  And my own reporters in Austin can't go to a rally for her.
[03:10:17.792 --> 03:10:21.414]  That was, by the way, black, hispanic, everybody, you name it.
[03:10:21.414 --> 03:10:21.754]  Nobody.
[03:10:21.754 --> 03:10:22.415]  Let me tell you something.
[03:10:22.415 --> 03:10:25.897]  You try to go to a patriot meeting if you're some white supremacist, we'll kick your ass.
[03:10:25.897 --> 03:10:28.819]  And you have your free speech.
[03:10:28.819 --> 03:10:31.921]  I'm not doing this because I hate black people or anybody else.
[03:10:31.921 --> 03:10:33.722]  I'm doing this because I want justice.
[03:10:36.005 --> 03:10:48.472]  And the left is so evil as like a union, as like a system, that they will defend anything as long as they're white.
[03:10:48.472 --> 03:10:51.714]  Which again is using race culture, which is very primitive and very bad.
[03:10:51.714 --> 03:10:54.476]  We're fighting Nazism, which means we're fighting this.
[03:10:54.476 --> 03:10:55.997]  The Nazis were a race culture.
[03:10:55.997 --> 03:10:57.758]  It works, we're primitive, we'll do it.
[03:10:57.758 --> 03:11:01.500]  Well they got the whites in... I'm not just being...
[03:11:02.756 --> 03:11:13.227]  I'm not defending leftists to say this, but it's mainly white people that are engaging in race baiting to minority groups trying to get them to be racist.
[03:11:13.227 --> 03:11:21.996]  And they've got some blacks to do it, and I guess a small minority of Hispanics, but I don't want to bash white people, but it's mainly white people.
[03:11:21.996 --> 03:11:25.519]  You name it, Jewish, German, whatever background.
[03:11:26.437 --> 03:11:33.082]  To push this, and you remember the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL put out, this is the most classic racist crap you've ever seen.
[03:11:34.727 --> 03:11:49.535]  And so, now this dead woman, people can't have a rally in Austin for him, you can't hand up signs in San Francisco, conservative students continue mourning the death of Kate Stanley, the woman murdered by an illegal alien, in a sanctuary, and remember, most of his victims were Hispanic.
[03:11:49.535 --> 03:11:53.778]  I'm not just saying that to verse your signal, that's who's being hurt!
[03:11:53.778 --> 03:11:57.300]  People say, oh, thank you for caring about a Hispanic person, or a black, I care about everybody, folks.
[03:11:58.499 --> 03:11:59.579]  I got feelings.
[03:11:59.579 --> 03:12:08.081]  In San Francisco, a leftist student continues to be triggered by her memory, and they again pull down the posters saying it's racist.
[03:12:08.081 --> 03:12:15.403]  So, here they are, anti-free speech, here's the video.
[03:12:15.403 --> 03:12:17.904]  Oh, you guys got a problem with the posters?
[03:12:17.904 --> 03:12:18.424]  Huh?
[03:12:18.424 --> 03:12:19.964]  You guys got a problem with the posters?
[03:12:19.964 --> 03:12:20.925]  Yes.
[03:12:20.925 --> 03:12:21.565]  And what would that be?
[03:12:22.424 --> 03:12:25.727]  Um, the problem was by saying she had dreams too.
[03:12:25.727 --> 03:12:29.350]  You're putting quite a, um, racist viewpoint.
[03:12:29.350 --> 03:12:31.892]  Ooh, dreams are racist now, huh?
[03:12:31.892 --> 03:12:32.853]  These are white women.
[03:12:32.853 --> 03:12:39.158]  You know, I'm not gonna have this conversation with you if you're gonna have that kind of tone, so... Ooh, my tone is racist now, too, isn't it?
[03:12:39.158 --> 03:12:41.100]  You don't want to have a conversation in the first place.
[03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:44.803]  You'd rather tear down posters.
[03:12:44.803 --> 03:12:46.845]  These are women that the state is their man.
[03:12:51.756 --> 03:12:55.077]  So they take down her picture.
[03:12:55.077 --> 03:13:02.460]  And notice the jury, most mainly a white jury, they had to say, we will not put a Hispanic man in jail because she's white.
[03:13:02.460 --> 03:13:06.082]  If she'd have been Hispanic, he'd have gone to prison.
[03:13:06.082 --> 03:13:09.903]  Because they can't ever say their policies are wrong.
[03:13:09.903 --> 03:13:12.644]  And then they have to take her picture down.
[03:13:12.644 --> 03:13:14.445]  So she had dreams too.
[03:13:14.445 --> 03:13:14.885]  And she's dead.
[03:13:16.715 --> 03:13:19.997]  She's in a coffin, she's a skeleton now.
[03:13:19.997 --> 03:13:29.804]  And, you know, you're not going to hear one activist, you're not going to hear those liberal white women that want to just act like they're on this big jihad and they live in this little fantasy land university where they can do this.
[03:13:29.804 --> 03:13:36.629]  Probably, but they both look like professors, or assistant professors, most of the anti-fascists.
[03:13:36.629 --> 03:13:44.054]  Did they say, hey, Hispanics, I hate that word, it's just people, you shouldn't take Gardasil
[03:13:45.504 --> 03:13:48.565]  It sterilizes and reduces fertility massively.
[03:13:48.565 --> 03:13:49.785]  Here's the studies.
[03:13:49.785 --> 03:13:57.968]  And they, in Mexico, tied IMF and World Bank money, billions of dollars, to giving Hispanic women Gardasil.
[03:13:57.968 --> 03:13:59.228]  And then it sterilizes them.
[03:13:59.228 --> 03:14:00.268]  It reduces their fertility.
[03:14:00.268 --> 03:14:03.750]  It doesn't completely sterilize them, it's statistical.
[03:14:03.750 --> 03:14:05.090]  But it reduces it.
[03:14:05.090 --> 03:14:14.673]  And then I have people go, hey man, I've had this a few times, like, not with white people even, but it's like they go, hey, if you're worried about all the Mexicans or whatever, why are you...
[03:14:15.725 --> 03:14:16.786]  They're just people.
[03:14:16.786 --> 03:14:19.227]  I'm not going to put Mexicans being racist against me.
[03:14:19.227 --> 03:14:22.529]  Don't like me because I'm, quote, white.
[03:14:22.529 --> 03:14:26.151]  Even though I'm part Native American, I can say statistically, you know, I'm Hispanic.
[03:14:26.151 --> 03:14:28.052]  That's all that means.
[03:14:28.052 --> 03:14:29.373]  I don't want them to get screwed.
[03:14:29.373 --> 03:14:30.053]  Me, nobody.
[03:14:30.053 --> 03:14:31.214]  I just want a future together.
[03:14:31.214 --> 03:14:31.594]  We can all
[03:14:33.459 --> 03:14:39.183]  By the time we reach 50 light years from here, we'll all just be basically a nice medium brown color.
[03:14:39.183 --> 03:14:41.044]  Folks, we're probably going to blow the planet up.
[03:14:41.044 --> 03:14:43.866]  Let me tell you, right now, God gives us a choice.
[03:14:43.866 --> 03:14:46.547]  I think it's 50-50 where we blow the whole planet up.
[03:14:46.547 --> 03:14:48.489]  And you know, God will just start back over again.
[03:14:48.489 --> 03:14:54.773]  But God Almighty, God Almighty, if I heard one Mechel or Raza group say, don't take the Gardasil shot,
[03:14:55.700 --> 03:15:00.306]  I'd say maybe Mitchell and Ross is a good group, but they don't because they're bought and paid for.
[03:15:00.306 --> 03:15:04.112]  They want to make you dumb racists to control you and run your life.
[03:15:04.112 --> 03:15:05.934]  Anthony Comea takes over after this break.
[03:15:05.934 --> 03:15:07.496]  Compoundmedia.com.
[03:15:07.496 --> 03:15:11.482]  I appreciate him sitting there for 10 minutes while I've been ranting, but this is truly sick.
[03:15:12.663 --> 03:15:13.444]  And evil.
[03:15:13.444 --> 03:15:15.284]  He's got his whole raft of stuff.
[03:15:15.284 --> 03:15:16.685]  It's always better than what I cover.
[03:15:16.685 --> 03:15:17.546]  So get ready.
[03:15:17.546 --> 03:15:18.826]  Compoundmedia.com.

[03:15:23.028 --> 03:15:24.509]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[03:15:24.509 --> 03:15:26.170]  They cut off all our sponsors and everything else.
[03:15:26.170 --> 03:15:27.991]  Like they fired Kumi off XM with Top Show.
[03:15:27.991 --> 03:15:29.352]  But you came and funded it.
[03:15:29.352 --> 03:15:30.512]  So fund us.
[03:15:30.512 --> 03:15:31.473]  Fund Compound Media.
[03:15:32.233 --> 03:15:34.955]  We'll continue to move on, but without you, we are nothing.
[03:15:34.955 --> 03:15:36.756]  Merry Christmas, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:36.756 --> 03:15:38.017]  Great job, crew.
[03:15:38.017 --> 03:15:39.978]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[03:15:39.978 --> 03:15:44.560]  Central, but David Knight's on in the morning, 8 a.m., and we got Owen Schwerer coming up in about 45 minutes.
[03:15:44.560 --> 03:15:46.522]  But right now, Anthony Comey is straight ahead.
[03:15:46.522 --> 03:15:47.002]  Stay with us.
[03:15:51.949 --> 03:15:54.512]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?

[03:16:12.051 --> 03:16:15.355]  You're getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now.
[03:16:15.355 --> 03:16:17.617]  Earth friendly and natural soaps.

[03:16:58.136 --> 03:17:00.977]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[03:17:21.731 --> 03:17:22.552]  This is Dan Pilla.
[03:17:22.552 --> 03:17:24.332]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[03:17:24.332 --> 03:17:25.973]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[03:17:25.973 --> 03:17:28.814]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[03:17:28.814 --> 03:17:31.095]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[03:17:31.095 --> 03:17:35.617]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[03:17:35.617 --> 03:17:39.559]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[03:17:39.559 --> 03:17:43.320]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:43.640]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:45.381]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:53.553 --> 03:17:54.354]  I'm so excited.
[03:17:54.354 --> 03:18:04.500]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:18:04.500 --> 03:18:10.004]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:18:10.004 --> 03:18:13.006]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:18:13.006 --> 03:18:21.812]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:18:23.893 --> 03:18:43.484]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:18:43.484 --> 03:18:46.165]  It is amazing!
[03:18:46.165 --> 03:18:51.128]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[03:18:52.998 --> 03:19:12.973]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:19:12.973 --> 03:19:15.094]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:19:15.094 --> 03:19:19.097]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:19.097 --> 03:19:20.118]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[03:19:20.518 --> 03:19:26.322]  We've got the best chloride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[03:19:26.322 --> 03:19:28.724]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:19:28.724 --> 03:19:34.147]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:19:34.147 --> 03:19:36.649]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:36.649 --> 03:19:45.835]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:19:45.835 --> 03:19:50.278]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[03:19:55.942 --> 03:20:07.810]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:07.810 --> 03:20:14.875]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.875 --> 03:20:18.118]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:20:21.215 --> 03:20:22.596]  Thank you.
[03:20:22.596 --> 03:20:23.417]  Thank you.
[03:20:23.417 --> 03:20:28.040]  I want to thank Alex Jones, of course.
[03:20:28.040 --> 03:20:28.881]  Merry Christmas.
[03:20:28.881 --> 03:20:34.125]  Happy New Year to everybody over there, over here at InfoWars.
[03:20:34.125 --> 03:20:41.170]  I was listening to Alex before this for the past probably a half hour.
[03:20:41.170 --> 03:20:43.231]  My God.
[03:20:43.231 --> 03:20:44.472]  My God.
[03:20:44.472 --> 03:20:50.517]  The Kate Steinle debacle over there in California, it's heart-wrenching.
[03:20:51.238 --> 03:20:54.520]  And infuriating.
[03:20:54.520 --> 03:21:03.746]  Just the sheer anger that you feel looking at something like this, from beginning to end.
[03:21:03.746 --> 03:21:19.797]  The second we heard that she was murdered, right there in front of her dad, I mean, just a beautiful, creative, contributing member of society.
[03:21:21.328 --> 03:21:24.530]  And it's rare that we see that in the news.
[03:21:24.530 --> 03:21:30.795]  That there's people that actually are doing something and have a family structure.
[03:21:30.795 --> 03:21:32.095]  She's out with her dad.
[03:21:32.095 --> 03:21:36.398]  How much more American can you get?
[03:21:36.398 --> 03:21:43.443]  Just a dad out with his daughter, beautiful day, out by the water.
[03:21:43.443 --> 03:21:49.507]  It's just such an affront to everything that we hold dear to us in this country.
[03:21:50.367 --> 03:21:58.350]  And her life is snuffed out by someone that shouldn't even have been in this country.
[03:21:58.350 --> 03:22:01.711]  It's so easy to see.
[03:22:01.711 --> 03:22:08.333]  It's so simple for any rational human being to see the good and the bad in this.
[03:22:08.333 --> 03:22:10.114]  The right and the wrong.
[03:22:10.114 --> 03:22:12.775]  The just and the unjust.
[03:22:12.775 --> 03:22:15.576]  That we see in this entire story.
[03:22:15.576 --> 03:22:17.437]  From the moment she was killed,
[03:22:18.906 --> 03:22:22.408]  Until this very second.
[03:22:22.408 --> 03:22:35.413]  It's not difficult for somebody that has a rational thought process to see what's wrong here.
[03:22:35.413 --> 03:22:44.357]  Yet, he's not convicted of, like Alex said, even manslaughter.
[03:22:45.310 --> 03:22:53.252]  You pick up a gun and it accidentally discharges and goes into somebody.
[03:22:53.252 --> 03:22:55.533]  It's a pretty good case for manslaughter there.
[03:22:55.533 --> 03:23:02.235]  And that was the defense saying that's what happened, you know.
[03:23:02.235 --> 03:23:07.316]  And they don't even convict him of that based on what?
[03:23:07.316 --> 03:23:08.576]  Evidence?
[03:23:08.576 --> 03:23:09.677]  No.
[03:23:09.677 --> 03:23:14.638]  It's based on a thought process and a system over there
[03:23:15.738 --> 03:23:41.119]  In California, and especially the Bay Area, that says that that woman's life was not worth as much as the life of somebody who was deported five times, obviously a criminal, and they let him go because of that.
[03:23:41.119 --> 03:23:44.922]  This was based on race and culture
[03:23:46.343 --> 03:23:50.306]  And social status, all of it.
[03:23:50.306 --> 03:24:06.259]  The idea of justice and weighing evidence and doling out punishment for crimes committed had nothing to do with the legal proceedings in this case.
[03:24:06.259 --> 03:24:09.302]  It was all politically motivated
[03:24:11.062 --> 03:24:19.367]  All motivated by the liberal agenda in California, and especially up there in the Bay Area.
[03:24:19.367 --> 03:24:22.789]  And we saw the result of that.
[03:24:22.789 --> 03:24:24.410]  Is the entire country like this?
[03:24:24.410 --> 03:24:27.171]  Thank God, no.
[03:24:27.171 --> 03:24:38.458]  But there are many areas in this country that are completely the opposite of what America is supposed to be about.
[03:24:39.916 --> 03:25:07.658]  And when we come around, we get around to Christmas time, which we are, the Christmas season, we get nostalgic and we start looking back to our youth and remembering what America was back then, what celebrating Christmas was, how much it was all about family and common values in this country.
[03:25:07.658 --> 03:25:08.859]  A common culture.
[03:25:09.978 --> 03:25:25.567]  The idea that we all know, as Americans, what's right, what's wrong, what's good, what's bad, that made this country the place that people did want to come to.
[03:25:25.567 --> 03:25:37.434]  Because the population of this country, for the most part, believe me, I know there's been lunatics and fringists in America since its inception, but overall,
[03:25:38.348 --> 03:25:50.696]  When you think back to America, you think back to a time when there was a common thread through its people.
[03:25:50.696 --> 03:25:51.317]  A pride.
[03:25:51.317 --> 03:26:01.924]  There's a pride in your nation, in living in a place that is so amazing that people die trying to get here.
[03:26:01.924 --> 03:26:03.705]  And that's what held it together.
[03:26:04.497 --> 03:26:13.239]  That's what held the country together, because no matter how different we are, and when they talk about diversity, it's our differences.
[03:26:13.239 --> 03:26:17.060]  But we need a common factor in there.
[03:26:17.060 --> 03:26:18.740]  And that's what made us Americans.
[03:26:18.740 --> 03:26:30.463]  And that common factor was a basic value system and an ideology that we all held dear.
[03:26:30.463 --> 03:26:33.144]  And when you look at a case like Kate Steinle,
[03:26:33.954 --> 03:26:40.059]  And see that there is a portion of this country willing to throw all that away.
[03:26:40.059 --> 03:26:52.268]  They don't want to be a part of the commonality and thread throughout the American people that made this country a cohesive unit.
[03:26:52.268 --> 03:27:02.957]  Because no matter where you come from and what your culture is and what you brought from the land that you came from or that your ancestors came from to this country,
[03:27:05.049 --> 03:27:31.939]  The one thing that brought it all together, that made us enjoy different foods and different interests and activities, religions, was that we were all doing it here in this amazing country, where we weren't supposed to be persecuted for those things and those ideas, where there was a distinction
[03:27:32.634 --> 03:27:38.878]  Between good and bad and what you should be doing and shouldn't be doing in this country.
[03:27:38.878 --> 03:27:43.501]  That is really going to the wayside.
[03:27:43.501 --> 03:27:57.951]  And that's the thing that people like myself and Alex and so many other people that call themselves patriots and to the laughter of certain people when you say you're a patriot and you're proud of your country.
[03:27:58.658 --> 03:28:07.706]  People laugh at that, and joke about it, while the whole thing seems to be swirling down the toilet.
[03:28:07.706 --> 03:28:10.528]  It's because we have that, we remember that.
[03:28:10.528 --> 03:28:12.370]  We enjoyed it.
[03:28:12.370 --> 03:28:18.175]  I enjoy thinking back, and when you say, make America great again, people laugh at that.
[03:28:18.175 --> 03:28:20.016]  Oh, Trump's little call sign.
[03:28:20.016 --> 03:28:22.638]  No, there was a greatness, and it had nothing to do with race.
[03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:25.810]  Or white supremacy.
[03:28:25.810 --> 03:28:33.016]  It had to do with that common thread that runs through us as Americans and always has.
[03:28:33.016 --> 03:28:33.736]  That ran through.
[03:28:33.736 --> 03:28:38.300]  That makes you do things for the greater good.
[03:28:38.300 --> 03:28:39.600]  Americans.
[03:28:39.600 --> 03:28:46.526]  And if we don't realize that very quickly, we're doomed as a once great nation.
[03:28:46.526 --> 03:28:48.167]  Gonna be back in a matter of moments.
[03:28:48.167 --> 03:28:48.887]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:48.887 --> 03:28:50.709]  Anthony Comey in at Infowars.com.
[03:28:51.789 --> 03:28:54.410]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[03:28:54.410 --> 03:28:55.430]  That's true.
[03:28:55.430 --> 03:29:00.491]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[03:29:00.491 --> 03:29:05.692]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.
[03:29:05.692 --> 03:29:09.893]  No stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.
[03:29:09.893 --> 03:29:13.693]  Call Life Benefits if you'd like a free book about how this can be done.

[03:34:34.924 --> 03:34:38.868]  Anthony Cumia in at InfoWars.com.
[03:34:38.868 --> 03:34:41.610]  Merry Christmas to everybody out there.
[03:34:41.610 --> 03:34:45.493]  This is my last broadcast here until the new year.
[03:34:45.493 --> 03:34:48.135]  So I want to talk a little bit about Christmas.
[03:34:50.610 --> 03:34:55.033]  I was saying just before that break, I get a bit nostalgic.
[03:34:55.033 --> 03:35:00.797]  I think everybody does when you think of Christmas.
[03:35:00.797 --> 03:35:06.661]  It's one of those times of the year when you reflect on your youth.
[03:35:06.661 --> 03:35:08.242]  It was such a big part of
[03:35:08.946 --> 03:35:22.594]  Of being a kid, your parents, family, friends, and you tend to remember all the good things when you think back and wax fantastic about days gone by.
[03:35:22.594 --> 03:35:31.639]  But I think it truly is one of those times a year where you do remember a lot of good things that actually happened.
[03:35:31.639 --> 03:35:33.560]  And I recall
[03:35:34.580 --> 03:35:38.822]  Uh, Christmas back, um, I guess it was, uh, the 70s.
[03:35:38.822 --> 03:35:42.103]  I could even remember, uh, people, ooh, late 60s.
[03:35:42.103 --> 03:35:43.764]  I do remember late 60s.
[03:35:43.764 --> 03:35:51.187]  Maybe first inklings of, uh, of thought process of your pal Anthony was probably 67, 68.
[03:35:51.187 --> 03:35:55.949]  I remember, um, I remember things like the Apollo program and, um,
[03:35:57.176 --> 03:35:57.557]  We're good to go.
[03:36:16.239 --> 03:36:35.231]  Just those things from back then, and like I said before the break, when you say make America great again, and people see hashtag MAGA, and you get this, these people that laugh at it, or call it racist, or sexist.
[03:36:35.231 --> 03:36:44.737]  Oh, you want to go back to this time when people didn't have rights, and people were being beaten in the streets, and the... No.
[03:36:44.737 --> 03:36:44.817]  No.
[03:36:45.613 --> 03:36:59.137]  Every country, no matter how great it is, has had a period of time that people were being plagued by injustice.
[03:36:59.137 --> 03:37:03.658]  Doesn't matter how great the country was at the time, there were always problems.
[03:37:03.658 --> 03:37:05.619]  Nothing's perfect.
[03:37:05.619 --> 03:37:11.921]  And no, no one is talking about making America great again by returning to
[03:37:14.321 --> 03:37:22.126]  Injustices and nightmares of civil rights infringements and whatnot.
[03:37:22.126 --> 03:37:30.811]  No, but when you say make America great again, you're talking about a greatness of the people of this country.
[03:37:30.811 --> 03:37:36.114]  And what I said before about a cohesive people.
[03:37:36.114 --> 03:37:42.658]  Not everyone thinking the same, but just having a common thread of being American and being proud
[03:37:43.323 --> 03:37:56.112]  Of being American and who you are, your culture, your background, everything that that your ancestors brought here is part of what makes this country America.
[03:37:56.112 --> 03:37:59.415]  And I'm thinking back at Christmas and.
[03:37:59.415 --> 03:38:08.441]  And I remember coming into New York City as a kid during Christmas with my family, and it was just an amazing thing.
[03:38:09.392 --> 03:38:20.017]  The way this city is decorated, and no matter how repulsive New York can be, there tended to be this niceness that went along with it.
[03:38:20.017 --> 03:38:25.159]  People were in there from the suburbs just seeing what New York City was like at Christmas time.
[03:38:25.159 --> 03:38:26.100]  Very romantic.
[03:38:26.100 --> 03:38:30.862]  It's been portrayed in so many movies and whatnot.
[03:38:30.862 --> 03:38:36.865]  And then I walk around now, and I try to weigh some of the differences.
[03:38:38.366 --> 03:38:43.510]  Because as you know, Christmas in certain parts of the country is a bad word.
[03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:45.731]  It's not inclusive enough.
[03:38:45.731 --> 03:38:47.172]  It's racist.
[03:38:47.172 --> 03:38:49.654]  It's Islamophobic.
[03:38:49.654 --> 03:38:52.756]  It's so many terrible things.
[03:38:52.756 --> 03:38:58.360]  And as I say, when I hearken back to my youth, I just remember it as being great.
[03:38:58.360 --> 03:38:59.620]  Being just an amazing time.
[03:38:59.620 --> 03:39:01.742]  You're off of school, you're gonna get presents.
[03:39:03.255 --> 03:39:05.156]  Your family is there.
[03:39:05.156 --> 03:39:10.097]  There's a little bit more niceness in the streets.
[03:39:10.097 --> 03:39:12.778]  So walk around now and what do I see?
[03:39:12.778 --> 03:39:19.701]  I see soldiers with automatic weapons.
[03:39:19.701 --> 03:39:30.164]  I see cement barriers that are set up everywhere to protect people that are just trying to
[03:39:31.158 --> 03:39:37.742]  Shop and walk around and enjoy the sights and see the tree here and celebrate Christmas.
[03:39:37.742 --> 03:39:38.762]  Signs everywhere.
[03:39:38.762 --> 03:39:42.504]  See something, say something.
[03:39:42.504 --> 03:39:45.826]  There's an overhanging threat.
[03:39:45.826 --> 03:39:51.049]  A black cloud hovering over Christmas now.
[03:39:51.049 --> 03:39:51.929]  Everywhere.
[03:39:51.929 --> 03:39:53.490]  And this isn't exclusive to New York.
[03:39:53.490 --> 03:39:56.552]  This is every city.
[03:39:56.552 --> 03:39:56.912]  London.
[03:39:59.528 --> 03:40:08.930]  You see these same barriers, and look, they paint them red and white, like they're supposed to, like they're supposed to be festive.
[03:40:08.930 --> 03:40:26.034]  This is a constant reminder that there are people out there and cultures out there that want us dead and want our traditions wiped from the face of the earth, including, yes, of course, Christmas.
[03:40:28.868 --> 03:40:34.553]  There's people in this very country that sympathize with that.
[03:40:34.553 --> 03:40:42.980]  That also want our traditions and cultures wiped away.
[03:40:42.980 --> 03:40:56.091]  When you used to come in to a big city and celebrate Christmas, at least like I said when I was a kid back in the late 60s, early 70s, you only thought about Christmas.
[03:40:57.260 --> 03:40:59.861]  And how much fun it was.
[03:40:59.861 --> 03:41:19.048]  And to walk around now and see the tree and the decorations and everything, it seemed to be... You still capture a little of that, but when you see men walking around various branches of the military and the police forces, walking around with automatic weapons, it's a constant reminder.
[03:41:19.048 --> 03:41:20.909]  And that's... it's just a sad thing.
[03:41:21.812 --> 03:41:30.860]  That we need to be constantly reminded, even at this time of year, that there are cultures that want to eliminate everything that we hold dear.
[03:41:30.860 --> 03:41:32.721]  And that is a tradition.
[03:41:32.721 --> 03:41:35.463]  There you go.
[03:41:35.463 --> 03:41:36.564]  That's great.
[03:41:36.564 --> 03:41:41.588]  And that's a tradition to America.
[03:41:41.588 --> 03:41:48.554]  That one of the many traditions that we built this country on.
[03:41:48.554 --> 03:41:50.436]  And that separates us
[03:41:51.132 --> 03:41:55.395]  From other countries and other cultures.
[03:41:55.395 --> 03:41:58.577]  You hear liberals constantly saying, live and let live.
[03:41:58.577 --> 03:42:00.738]  Let's be tolerant.
[03:42:00.738 --> 03:42:03.920]  We must accept this and that.
[03:42:03.920 --> 03:42:16.107]  Well, why are traditional American traditions the thing that can be sacrificed with impunity?
[03:42:16.107 --> 03:42:18.989]  And the second you start defending them,
[03:42:19.631 --> 03:42:24.072]  You are either a racist or homophobic or Islamophobic, something.
[03:42:24.072 --> 03:42:26.313]  Some kind of phobic or ist.
[03:42:26.313 --> 03:42:33.556]  When you're only defending traditions that you remember and that were great.
[03:42:33.556 --> 03:42:43.879]  When I think back to this country, the traditional Christmas with your family, going out in the city and seeing all the amazing things as a kid.
[03:42:44.508 --> 03:42:45.750]  Can we get back to that?
[03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:47.132]  I have no idea.
[03:42:47.132 --> 03:42:48.313]  Be back in moments.
[03:42:48.313 --> 03:42:48.934]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:48.934 --> 03:42:50.756]  Anthony Cumia, InfoWars.com.
[03:42:51.812 --> 03:42:56.213]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[03:42:56.213 --> 03:43:04.295]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:43:04.295 --> 03:43:09.576]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:43:09.576 --> 03:43:12.096]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:43:12.096 --> 03:43:16.317]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:43:16.317 --> 03:43:18.758]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:43:19.458 --> 03:43:26.703]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:43:26.703 --> 03:43:34.767]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:43:34.767 --> 03:43:41.952]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:43:41.952 --> 03:43:43.393]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[03:48:49.767 --> 03:48:50.568]  Absolutely.
[03:48:51.647 --> 03:48:55.009]  Welcome back, Anthony Cumia in at InfoWars.com.
[03:48:55.009 --> 03:49:07.696]  Of course, the holiday season, Christmas time, and what would any Christmas be without the progressives trying to destroy our traditions?
[03:49:07.696 --> 03:49:10.378]  It is amazing.
[03:49:10.378 --> 03:49:14.140]  Christmas is a holiday that is just fair game.
[03:49:15.140 --> 03:49:33.173]  Fair game for anyone, any group that wants to trot upon it, trounce it, denounce it, twist it and turn it till it's barely recognizable to the offense of people that hold it dear as a tradition to them.
[03:49:34.605 --> 03:49:45.952]  But, again, people that celebrate Christmas traditionally through the liberal left, what we've seen from progressives, are the most intolerant people.
[03:49:45.952 --> 03:49:47.473]  So intolerant.
[03:49:47.473 --> 03:50:00.222]  Yet, they happen to be the most tolerant people ever because no one's rioting when these people just trounce on our traditions.
[03:50:00.222 --> 03:50:02.283]  You don't see riots, you don't see people
[03:50:03.192 --> 03:50:11.397]  Murdering or beating people in the streets because we've, uh, we've been offended by some of these things?
[03:50:11.397 --> 03:50:18.141]  I'm gonna tell you a little story here, and I want you to, um, to insert, uh, Muhammad in here.
[03:50:18.141 --> 03:50:19.061]  Or Islam.
[03:50:19.061 --> 03:50:21.283]  Or, or any other religion, really.
[03:50:21.283 --> 03:50:25.525]  Uh, CNN was hyping a new children's book.
[03:50:25.525 --> 03:50:26.926]  Isn't that adorable?
[03:50:26.926 --> 03:50:29.287]  A children's book about Santa.
[03:50:29.287 --> 03:50:30.528]  This is great, right?
[03:50:32.786 --> 03:50:34.247]  Uh, yeah.
[03:50:34.247 --> 03:50:45.075]  Uh, we suppose there's supposed to be some sort of shock factor involved in learning there's a children's book called Santa's Husband.
[03:50:45.075 --> 03:50:48.417]  In which Santa is black and gay!
[03:50:48.417 --> 03:50:53.900]  But frankly, now that we're aware of it, we'd be more surprised if there wasn't such a thing.
[03:50:53.900 --> 03:50:54.381]  Would we?
[03:50:55.655 --> 03:51:07.040]  Would we be more surprised if there wasn't such a thing as Santa's husband where Santa is black and gay?
[03:51:07.040 --> 03:51:25.107]  After seeing the gativity scene with two Josephs, the gativity scene, why do they always pick this Christianity?
[03:51:26.155 --> 03:51:35.200]  Whenever a group wants to crap all over a religion, it will always be Christianity.
[03:51:35.200 --> 03:51:49.808]  And the traditional holidays and services, figures, religious figures of Christianity constantly.
[03:51:49.808 --> 03:51:54.311]  They are able to make Santa Joseph gay.
[03:51:55.299 --> 03:51:56.319]  Change their race.
[03:51:56.319 --> 03:51:58.280]  Make them gay.
[03:51:58.280 --> 03:52:00.380]  Which would be an affront to- Oh my God.
[03:52:00.380 --> 03:52:09.803]  Could you imagine- Look, I don't know if this is proper to say, but just imagine you did HOMO HAMMOD.
[03:52:09.803 --> 03:52:10.903]  Do you think that would fly?
[03:52:10.903 --> 03:52:19.746]  Do you think everyone involved with doing something like that would need to strap on Kevlar to go to work every day?
[03:52:19.746 --> 03:52:22.927]  Lest they be gunned down or blown up?
[03:52:22.927 --> 03:52:23.207]  I do.
[03:52:24.338 --> 03:52:26.139]  I absolutely do.
[03:52:26.139 --> 03:52:27.519]  You know why?
[03:52:27.519 --> 03:52:30.300]  Intolerance.
[03:52:30.300 --> 03:52:46.785]  We talk about, or the progressives talk about Christianity and Christmas and all of the holidays pretty much and our traditions and basic values of Christianity as being intolerant.
[03:52:46.785 --> 03:52:52.627]  Yet when our religion and our culture and value system gets crapped on,
[03:52:53.815 --> 03:52:55.556]  We just take it.
[03:52:55.556 --> 03:53:00.819]  We literally turn the other cheek, complain about it, talk about it.
[03:53:00.819 --> 03:53:02.760]  That is our right.
[03:53:02.760 --> 03:53:05.121]  That is our right.
[03:53:05.121 --> 03:53:07.402]  But do we take to the streets?
[03:53:07.402 --> 03:53:08.723]  Do we destroy property?
[03:53:08.723 --> 03:53:09.903]  Do we assault people?
[03:53:09.903 --> 03:53:11.964]  Do we murder people because of it?
[03:53:11.964 --> 03:53:12.865]  No.
[03:53:12.865 --> 03:53:16.306]  Because we are tolerant.
[03:53:16.306 --> 03:53:21.989]  It's another one of these crazy, backward world things that go on when you talk about progressives.
[03:53:24.395 --> 03:53:27.357]  Just a grave intolerance going on.
[03:53:27.357 --> 03:53:28.978]  We all remember Charlie Hebdo.
[03:53:28.978 --> 03:53:33.760]  Oh boy, were they in Dutch when they tried to talk about Islam.
[03:53:33.760 --> 03:53:40.684]  Yet Christianity can just be used and abused by people.
[03:53:40.684 --> 03:53:42.245]  The gay-tivity scene.
[03:53:42.245 --> 03:53:45.847]  I've never heard of the gay-tivity scene.
[03:53:45.847 --> 03:53:51.130]  And now I'm just hearing about Santa being gay and black.
[03:53:51.130 --> 03:53:51.530]  There it is.
[03:53:51.530 --> 03:53:53.031]  Is that the gay-tivity scene?
[03:53:54.039 --> 03:54:09.028]  Now, any other religion, using any other religious figures in this way, I would say that that house would be in flames in no time.
[03:54:09.028 --> 03:54:16.853]  But, they're able to do this, they practice their freedom of expression on their own property, and they get complaints
[03:54:17.634 --> 03:54:24.980]  They get people like myself and other people in independent media that might criticize it.
[03:54:24.980 --> 03:54:32.366]  But no one's going over there and kicking it over or throwing a Molotov cocktail through their window.
[03:54:32.366 --> 03:54:40.452]  Because the progressives version of the most intolerant people are the most tolerant people.
[03:54:40.452 --> 03:54:43.374]  Topsy-turvy backward world that we live in.
[03:54:43.374 --> 03:54:44.135]  I must talk.
[03:54:44.662 --> 03:54:49.965]  Quickly about Rosie O'Donnell, the giant gift that keeps giving.
[03:54:49.965 --> 03:54:51.625]  Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:54:51.625 --> 03:54:58.168]  She's lost her mind since Trump even said he was running for president.
[03:54:58.168 --> 03:55:04.952]  A few years back, her and Donald Trump were in a bit of a battle when he was still with The Apprentice.
[03:55:04.952 --> 03:55:13.696]  And she was so angry with Donald Trump's tax plan that looks like it will come to fruition.
[03:55:14.969 --> 03:55:22.112]  That she offered two senators two million dollars each to vote no on it.
[03:55:22.112 --> 03:55:24.573]  To vote no.
[03:55:24.573 --> 03:55:26.734]  This is a crime.
[03:55:26.734 --> 03:55:27.475]  There it is.
[03:55:27.475 --> 03:55:37.459]  She promises to give two million to Senator Susan Collins and two million to Senator Jake Flake to vote no on the tax bill.
[03:55:37.459 --> 03:55:38.520]  Two million dollars.
[03:55:39.615 --> 03:55:42.297]  Uh, apparently this is against the 18 U.S.
[03:55:42.297 --> 03:55:49.060]  Code 201, criminalizing the attempt of bribery of federal officials by whoever.
[03:55:49.060 --> 03:55:55.824]  And apparently, you will be fined three times the amount of the bribe.
[03:55:55.824 --> 03:56:05.789]  So she could be fined $12 million and go to prison for doing this.
[03:56:05.789 --> 03:56:07.030]  She's insane.
[03:56:08.189 --> 03:56:11.211]  Much like the progressive left is insane.
[03:56:11.211 --> 03:56:17.335]  But I give her one pass, and it's like my good friend Michael Malice said on my show yesterday.
[03:56:17.335 --> 03:56:18.595]  Think about it.
[03:56:18.595 --> 03:56:30.963]  This is a guy that called her fat, called her a slob, said that if she doesn't watch her step, he will take her girlfriend away, and believe me, I can do it.
[03:56:30.963 --> 03:56:32.304]  Trump said all these things.
[03:56:32.304 --> 03:56:33.324]  Hilarious.
[03:56:33.324 --> 03:56:34.625]  Hilarious.
[03:56:34.625 --> 03:56:37.367]  That guy is now the president.
[03:56:39.412 --> 03:56:46.656]  Imagine somebody that you have perceived as bullying you over the years and calling you horrible things.
[03:56:46.656 --> 03:56:53.460]  And not only do they get away with it, they become the leader of the free world.
[03:56:53.460 --> 03:57:03.286]  So I almost give Rosie O'Donnell a pass on her insanity.
[03:57:03.286 --> 03:57:05.748]  The rest of the left, I don't know what it is.
[03:57:05.748 --> 03:57:07.809]  Self-destructive personality.
[03:57:09.066 --> 03:57:30.928]  What have you, but I really do hope some branch of the judicial system goes after Rosie O'Donnell for offering millions of dollars in bribery to senators to vote no on a bill that a legally elected president and Congress voted on.
[03:57:32.035 --> 03:57:33.077]  She's out of her mind.
[03:57:33.077 --> 03:57:35.765]  Thank you very much, InfoWars, Alex Jones.
[03:57:35.765 --> 03:57:39.475]  Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and we'll see you next time on InfoWars.com.
[03:57:39.475 --> 03:57:40.217]  I'm Anthony Cumia.
[03:57:41.209 --> 03:57:41.910]  Pleasure.
[03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:43.791]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:57:43.791 --> 03:57:45.112]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:57:45.112 --> 03:57:46.313]  Why is this so good?
[03:57:46.313 --> 03:57:51.597]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:57:51.597 --> 03:58:05.148]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:58:05.148 --> 03:58:06.510]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:58:07.290 --> 03:58:08.933]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:58:08.933 --> 03:58:11.496]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:58:11.496 --> 03:58:12.798]  These are all parasites.
[03:58:12.798 --> 03:58:13.919]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:58:13.919 --> 03:58:15.261]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:58:15.261 --> 03:58:19.768]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:58:19.768 --> 03:58:22.912]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:58:23.032 --> 03:58:26.074]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:58:26.074 --> 03:58:27.135]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:58:27.135 --> 03:58:29.076]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:58:29.076 --> 03:58:30.096]  And folks, you can't lose.

[03:58:36.060 --> 03:58:38.302]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
