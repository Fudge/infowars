[00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:20.596]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:24.599]  It is Tuesday, January 10th, 2017, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:25.740]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:38.770]  Tonight, social justice warriors unite as radical leftists prepare for what they hope will be one of the biggest riots in U.S.
[00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.330]  history.
[00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:41.492]  Target date, inauguration day.
[00:00:57.253 --> 00:01:01.894]  Meanwhile, the Hollywood elite prepare for their moment in the spotlight.
[00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:09.055]  And instead of moving to Canada, some of the nation's biggest celebrities will join anti-Trump rallies in Washington.
[00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:19.357]  All that plus more censorship on Facebook as another pro-Trump account has been shut down.
[00:01:19.617 --> 00:01:22.618]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.626 --> 00:03:15.332]  Well, we're just 10 days away from the inauguration of President Donald Trump, and sad loser lefties could not be any more angry.
[00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:20.655]  They are promising to make this the least peaceful, pleasant transition.
[00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:21.355]  Ever.
[00:03:21.716 --> 00:03:28.862]  Now we have anarchists actually hoping to turn Donald Trump's inauguration into one of the biggest riots in U.S.
[00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:29.502]  history.
[00:03:29.983 --> 00:03:34.247]  Their stated goal is to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as possible.
[00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:38.490]  They're planning a wide range of actions to achieve that stated goal.
[00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:43.355]  Some moderate groups are using terms like civil resistance and civil disobedience.
[00:03:43.755 --> 00:03:50.799]  But others are openly talking about blockades, jumping barricades, throwing projectiles, and citywide paralysis.
[00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:51.980]  There's a new term.
[00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:57.704]  So these groups are well-funded, highly organized, and extremely motivated.
[00:03:57.744 --> 00:03:59.585]  That's something that you need to understand.
[00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:03.527]  We're seeing Al Sharpton calling for a season of civil disobedience.
[00:04:03.627 --> 00:04:06.269]  Michael Moore is calling for 100 days of protest.
[00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:07.690]  They're so angry.
[00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.553]  So there's actually a full page ad taken out of the New York Times on Wednesday.
[00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:29.601]  This is one activist group, including thousands of activists, journalists, scientists, entertainers, and other prominent voices, all taking part in this ad with the simple message, no, no, stop the Trump-Pence regime before it starts.
[00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:34.244]  In the name of humanity, we refuse to accept a fascist America.
[00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:50.838]  And they refuse to accept a fascist America so much that they are going to shut down anything that they disagree with and they are not against using violence or bullying to achieve those means to stop fascism here in America.
[00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:55.663]  So here we just go with the hypocritical lefty logic.
[00:04:55.783 --> 00:04:56.704]  I don't understand it.
[00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:02.769]  The fact is, Trump did not create the dire situations that you people are in.
[00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:09.115]  People that are so upset, of course, that Bernie Sanders didn't get elected, that were very supportive of his message and what he was all about.
[00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:11.538]  These are the kind of people that were wanting that kind of change.
[00:05:12.058 --> 00:05:14.861]  Donald Trump did not create this situation.
[00:05:15.302 --> 00:05:19.866]  In fact, if Hillary Clinton would have gotten in, it would have been more of the same.
[00:05:20.427 --> 00:05:29.094]  Hope and change that is leaving this entire millennial generation without any hope and just hoping for change so they can get out of their parents' basements.
[00:05:29.635 --> 00:05:33.598]  Now, Owen Schroyer is going to be joining me in studio later on and we're going to talk a little bit about that.
[00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.641]  Just, you might be a loony liberal if...
[00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:42.303]  But let's talk a little bit about the legacy that Obama is leaving behind.
[00:05:42.483 --> 00:05:54.186]  Now Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, they did offer a $30,000 reward to any administration employee who would publicly expose the administration officially disposing of any information.
[00:05:54.786 --> 00:06:01.107]  And they say that the Obama administration is already destroying public records in the final days of office.
[00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:07.129]  That's right, the most transparent administration ever is destroying public records.
[00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:17.815]  Now, of course, past administrations, both Republican and Democratic players, have always involved themselves in this mass destruction of records when they leave office.
[00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:27.060]  But Julian Assange said that he's being told that they are in the process of destroying these records right now in different parts of the Obama administration.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.162]  Um, different agencies and so he's saying, you know, their philosophy there at WikiLeaks is that information is a part of history.
[00:06:35.622 --> 00:06:46.324]  It belongs legally and philosophically to the American people and more broadly, uh, insofar as the United States interacts with the world, it belongs to the people of the world.
[00:06:46.764 --> 00:06:54.846]  Now, I guarantee you everything that happened with Hillary Clinton and the entire email scandal, I guarantee you many, many, many people in Washington
[00:06:55.726 --> 00:07:01.048]  Purchased the bleach bit software and got rid of anything on their servers already.
[00:07:01.148 --> 00:07:02.649]  I can guarantee you of that.
[00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.510]  But of course, again, this is all subject to FOIA.
[00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:14.613]  And this type of information, as long as it's not heavily classified, even then it can be declassified after 50, 100 years.
[00:07:15.013 --> 00:07:16.333]  This belongs in the public record.
[00:07:16.554 --> 00:07:17.194]  So there you go.
[00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:20.355]  Any officials that are willing to stand up, you can get $30,000 cash from WikiLeaks.
[00:07:23.456 --> 00:07:36.085]  Now, one thing we can all say a big hooray to with the outgoing Obama administration is the fact that we are no longer going to have to be subjected to the media drooling over Barack Obama.
[00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:39.528]  This was a good story out of Newsbusters today, just kind of
[00:07:40.328 --> 00:07:48.014]  Go at taking you back on a little stroll through some of the media's coverage of Barack Obama as soon as he showed up on the national stage.
[00:07:48.595 --> 00:07:51.517]  Some of the headlines, Obama is a rock star.
[00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:54.519]  He's the Tiger Woods of the Democratic Party right now.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.142]  It's almost hard to remain objective because it's infectious.
[00:07:58.582 --> 00:07:59.143]  The energy.
[00:07:59.323 --> 00:08:00.364]  Oh, he's so impressive.
[00:08:00.424 --> 00:08:01.785]  He's so charismatic.
[00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:03.106]  Something special.
[00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:05.208]  His chiseled pectorals.
[00:08:05.928 --> 00:08:09.812]  Prodigious talent and his amazing legislative agenda.
[00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:10.653]  Huge achievement.
[00:08:10.873 --> 00:08:12.575]  He's one of our brightest presidents.
[00:08:13.176 --> 00:08:14.898]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:08:15.118 --> 00:08:19.082]  He's the most noble man who has ever lived in the White House.
[00:08:19.503 --> 00:08:22.786]  Now, this is the same media who is trying to tell us that they're not
[00:08:23.527 --> 00:08:34.276]  In the business of producing fake news, this is the same people who just applauded the fact that President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize when he hadn't even done anything.
[00:08:34.336 --> 00:08:38.299]  He had barely even been in office for a few months and they gave him the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:44.264]  Meanwhile, he's dropped more bombs on anyone, any president before him, really.
[00:08:44.404 --> 00:08:48.668]  So, you know, we can say goodbye to the media drooling over President Barack Obama.
[00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:51.010]  Hopefully he will fade into the distance.
[00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:59.114]  It's really interesting to see how these Democratic presidents and their ilk cannot get enough of these celebrity endorsements.
[00:08:59.494 --> 00:09:06.057]  And it's really great to see how those celebrity endorsements just don't hold the same weight as they used to.
[00:09:06.617 --> 00:09:12.060]  Cher, Katy Perry, Amy Schumer are going to be attending the anti-Trump protests in Washington.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.764]  Of course, they were there stumping for Hillary Clinton, and we see where that got them.
[00:09:18.565 --> 00:09:29.874]  But they're going to, you know, let everyone know that as artists, women, and most importantly, dedicated Americans, they are going to stand together in solidarity for the protection, dignity, and rights of our communities.
[00:09:30.275 --> 00:09:36.420]  Now, no one actually spoke out against, you know, that Facebook kidnap and torture video that was livestreamed.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:51.131]  That really didn't, that or any of the other myriad of stories that we're hearing about Trump supporters being attacked violently by people, both physically and verbally, that doesn't warrant any kind of outcry from any celebs.
[00:09:51.652 --> 00:10:01.059]  Of course, we had the MMA fighters fighting back against Meryl Streep's little hit piece at the Golden Globes when she said, you know, Hollywood's crawling with foreigners.
[00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:05.023]  If you kick them all out, all you have is football and mixed martial arts.
[00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:25.535]  So basically she's saying that it's only lowbrow forms of entertainment for paupers and they were quick to point out how she's giving this speech about calling on Americans to rise above hatred and intolerance, yet casually dismissing most of the Americans who watch sports and MMA.
[00:10:25.575 --> 00:10:26.956]  It's a very popular sport.
[00:10:27.416 --> 00:10:30.058]  So there you go again with the hypocrisy.
[00:10:31.724 --> 00:10:46.015]  And kind of on that, where you're calling them out on their hypocrisy, Owen Schreier kind of talked about that earlier, that you can't really argue or reason with them, so there you go, you're using memes, and that's exactly what Russia has now begun to do.
[00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:50.678]  The Russian embassy actually tweeted, Pepe the frog meme.
[00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:59.281]  In response to the headlines, the pundits calling on Theresa May to disrupt possible Russia-US thaw.
[00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:02.961]  And they said, no trust in Britain's best friend and ally?
[00:11:03.502 --> 00:11:05.062]  So here you go, Pepe the Frog.
[00:11:06.282 --> 00:11:08.022]  And is he a Russian agent?
[00:11:08.363 --> 00:11:14.484]  This is how I think they are going to say that the Russians influenced our election with Pepe the Frog.
[00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:19.585]  And of course, social justice warriors were really upset, tweeting back at the Russian embassy.
[00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:26.088]  Um, do you know that you are supporting an image that's popular among white nationalists?
[00:11:26.348 --> 00:11:26.448]  Ugh.
[00:11:26.708 --> 00:11:27.788]  Very, very upset there.
[00:11:28.549 --> 00:11:35.572]  So, moving along to another story that's actually quite serious, and this one really pissed me off, and I just wanted to draw everyone's attention to it.
[00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:45.502]  So that you will give your voice to maybe people in your community who are having to fight back against the state and Child Protective Services taking away their kids.
[00:11:45.522 --> 00:11:48.025]  A lot of people are afraid to speak out against this.
[00:11:48.686 --> 00:11:57.775]  So you might have heard the story about a woman and her boyfriend who killed and dismembered their 14-year-old daughter, their adoptive daughter.
[00:11:58.817 --> 00:12:05.184]  Last summer, they were acting out a rape and murder fantasy when they killed 14-year-old Grace Packer.
[00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:06.465]  This was in Pennsylvania.
[00:12:06.966 --> 00:12:11.451]  They were charged Sunday with homicide, rape, conspiracy, kidnapping, and abuse of a corpse.
[00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:12.632]  Well, get this.
[00:12:13.072 --> 00:12:13.753]  This woman
[00:12:14.514 --> 00:12:16.535]  She worked for child services.
[00:12:17.055 --> 00:12:19.397]  She was an adoption supervisor.
[00:12:19.557 --> 00:12:21.978]  She took in six foster children.
[00:12:22.418 --> 00:12:39.868]  And before this, before her and her boyfriend plotted for nearly a year to do this to this girl, she was married to another man who was charged in two child sex abuse cases against girls under the age of 16, another 13 years old.
[00:12:40.368 --> 00:12:42.069]  So these are people who are
[00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:49.397]  Using their position, gravitating toward these jobs where they're going to be around kids.
[00:12:49.857 --> 00:13:00.909]  But this is the kind of woman who you're having to deal with when you're dealing with Child Protective Services and the state agencies who are telling you whether or not you're fit enough to be a parent.
[00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.613]  Whether you can adopt a child, whether you're fit.
[00:13:04.113 --> 00:13:14.428]  So when you hear these stories of flashback in California, a thousand California foster care homes match sex offender addresses, don't believe the hype.
[00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:17.513]  Help your neighbors if they're trying to fight these state agencies.
[00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:27.904]  The confirmation hearings for President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet began with Senator Jeff Sessions' confirmation as the United States Attorney General.
[00:13:28.305 --> 00:13:33.588]  In my over 14 years in the Department of Justice, I tried cases personally of every kind.
[00:13:34.028 --> 00:13:46.316]  Drug trafficking, very large international smuggling cases, many firearms cases, other violent crimes, a series of public corruption cases of quite significance.
[00:13:46.796 --> 00:13:49.877]  Financial wrongdoing and environmental violations.
[00:13:50.357 --> 00:13:54.978]  Our office supported historic civil rights cases and major civil cases.
[00:13:55.398 --> 00:14:04.060]  Protecting the people of this country from crime, and especially from violent crime, is a high calling of the men and women of the Department of Justice.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.200]  Today, I'm afraid, it's become more important than ever.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:14.702]  Of course, brainwashed activists fed lies by the mainstream media and the Democratic Party disrupted the proceedings.
[00:14:21.825 --> 00:14:25.348]  That a number of states were systematic.
[00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.351]  Senator Sessions addressed those concerns admirably.
[00:14:45.391 --> 00:15:02.937]  But I have not seen any appointee to the cabinet, Democrat or Republican, who has a record like you do of prosecuting Klansmen, putting them on death row, bankrupting them and putting them out of business, and doing so as you had.
[00:15:02.997 --> 00:15:04.938]  I'll tell you, I admire your doing so.
[00:15:06.058 --> 00:15:08.479]  And I'll issue a challenge to our friends in the news media.
[00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:15.474]  I noticed every time a protester jumped up, all the photographers took pictures of the protesters.
[00:15:15.534 --> 00:15:17.557]  I suspect we're going to see them in all the papers.
[00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:22.665]  I would encourage the news media, cover this story.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:38.784]  Tell the story on the 6 o'clock news about Jeff Sessions helping prosecute a Klansman who had murdered an innocent African-American man and putting him on death row and bankrupting, helping bankrupt the Klan in Alabama.
[00:15:38.824 --> 00:15:40.364]  That's a story that needs to be told.
[00:15:40.384 --> 00:15:42.165]  Senator Sessions, I thank you for your record.
[00:15:42.605 --> 00:15:43.465]  I thank you for your service.
[00:15:44.085 --> 00:15:51.807]  Thank you, Senator Cruz, and I would say it has been very disappointing and painful to have it suggested.
[00:15:51.887 --> 00:16:02.970]  I think the Klan was okay when we did everything possible to destroy and defeat and prosecute the Klan members who were involved in this crime, and it was a good joint effort.
[00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.352]  I was supportive of it every step of the way, and some great lawyers worked very hard on it.
[00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:16.061]  But the Democrats still question Sessions' two decades of experience, twisting it to meet their political bias.
[00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:33.356]  Who was deemed too racially insensitive to be a federal district court judge.
[00:16:33.796 --> 00:16:40.723]  All of us believe it's unacceptable for someone with Senator Sessions' record to lead the Department of Justice.
[00:16:41.504 --> 00:16:44.346]  This caricature of me in 1986 was not correct.
[00:16:47.731 --> 00:16:49.432]  I had become a United States Attorney.
[00:16:49.973 --> 00:17:08.165]  I supported, as the Civil Rights Attorney said, major civil rights cases in my district that integrated schools, that prosecuted the Klan, that ended single-member districts, that denied African Americans the right to hold office.
[00:17:08.645 --> 00:17:10.686]  I did everything I was required to do.
[00:17:11.127 --> 00:17:16.630]  And the complaints about the voter fraud case and the complaints about the Klan case that I vigorously
[00:17:18.752 --> 00:17:21.093]  Prosecuted and supported are false.
[00:17:21.453 --> 00:17:28.656]  And I do hope this hearing today will show that I conducted myself honorably and properly at that time.
[00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:30.977]  And that I am the same person.
[00:17:31.497 --> 00:17:35.999]  Perhaps wiser and maybe a little better, I hope so, today than I was then.
[00:17:36.379 --> 00:17:42.582]  But I did not harbor the kind of animosities and race-based discrimination ideas that were
[00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:44.803]  I was accused of.
[00:17:45.103 --> 00:17:46.023]  I did not.
[00:17:46.503 --> 00:17:49.705]  Senator Sessions held his ground and answered truthfully.
[00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:56.068]  A tactic that has been all but non-existent during the previous two Attorney General confirmations.
[00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.309]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:04.145]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:18:04.225 --> 00:18:07.607]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:12.490]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.412]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:18:15.532 --> 00:18:21.456]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:18:21.676 --> 00:18:25.259]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.282]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:36.910]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:18:37.931 --> 00:18:46.694]  is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:18:46.794 --> 00:18:51.936]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:18:52.436 --> 00:18:56.297]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:18:56.317 --> 00:18:58.238]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:18:58.318 --> 00:19:00.759]  Is it one world the central bankers in charge?
[00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:15.671]  Now, what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:16.872]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.512 --> 00:19:18.693]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.154 --> 00:19:22.336]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.877 --> 00:19:27.160]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.

[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.

[00:23:07.327 --> 00:23:12.609]  I'm joined in studio now by Democratic strategist and Democrats for Trump founder Harlan Hill.
[00:23:12.689 --> 00:23:14.450]  Harlan, welcome to the InfoWar.
[00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:23.634]  I noticed you on Paul's show earlier this week and I couldn't help but want you as a guest myself talking about this narrative of fake news.
[00:23:23.674 --> 00:23:25.615]  We've heard it a lot in the mainstream media.
[00:23:26.215 --> 00:23:39.426]  And I really wanted to take this line of questioning to Hillary supporters, because you're a Democrat after all, Harlan, and just wanting to know, we've seen Clinton supporters in the media lately whining and sniffling like babies.
[00:23:39.987 --> 00:23:47.714]  What role do you think the mainstream media has played in the psychological unhinging of Clinton supporters, if you had to guess?
[00:23:48.684 --> 00:23:50.744]  Well, I think that they're wholly responsible for it.
[00:23:51.345 --> 00:23:56.406]  You know, if acceptance is the last stage of grief, Democrats have a long way to go.
[00:23:56.426 --> 00:23:57.786]  And I think the media does too.
[00:23:58.626 --> 00:24:04.647]  Something I told Paul the other day, and I'll tell you too, I mean, I don't think that we have real journalists in this country anymore.
[00:24:05.007 --> 00:24:09.188]  Even if you're speaking on a global scale, I don't think that there are that many journalists left on the planet.
[00:24:09.568 --> 00:24:11.909]  I think that we have political activists.
[00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:20.353]  Mostly liberals running the mainstream media news outlets and they feel at least in part responsible for the rise of Donald Trump.
[00:24:21.053 --> 00:24:25.936]  And now they're totally set on undermining his presidency.
[00:24:26.636 --> 00:24:34.600]  And in the process, I think a lot of Democrats have fallen victim to the propaganda that the mainstream media is pushing.
[00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:37.422]  And what I mean by that is that they've been told, I think,
[00:24:37.762 --> 00:24:43.543]  Most voters have been told for well over a year now that Donald Trump is quote-unquote literally Hitler.
[00:24:44.043 --> 00:24:45.344]  Now that's dangerous rhetoric.
[00:24:46.244 --> 00:24:47.784]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:24:47.864 --> 00:24:50.925]  It cheapens the atrocities committed by Hitler.
[00:24:52.585 --> 00:24:56.226]  It's just ridiculous and it should be out of bounds, but that's what people have been told.
[00:24:56.646 --> 00:24:58.106]  And so they're hysterical.
[00:24:58.926 --> 00:25:02.647]  Even last night, I think it was last night, Rachel Maddow on MSNBC said,
[00:25:03.547 --> 00:25:06.749]  That she asked Donald Trump, are you going to send me to a camp?
[00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:08.470]  Are you going to send my friends to camp?
[00:25:08.891 --> 00:25:15.035]  Now she's referring to, you know, she's referring, she's making reference to the Holocaust.
[00:25:15.075 --> 00:25:16.395]  That's clearly what she's saying.
[00:25:16.415 --> 00:25:16.475]  And
[00:25:18.897 --> 00:25:19.698]  That's dangerous.
[00:25:19.878 --> 00:25:36.827]  It leads people to fall into this cycle of hysteria where they can't accept the reality that they're actually living in, that they're paranoid, they're hyper-focused on conspiracy theories that aren't there, and it's manufactured by the media and a lot of it's fake news.
[00:25:36.867 --> 00:25:44.772]  You saw this last week with the Washington Post, I'll just leave it with this, you know, pushing that fake story on Vermont, saying that the Russians had infiltrated the power grid.
[00:25:45.052 --> 00:25:46.033]  It's been totally debunked.
[00:25:46.113 --> 00:25:48.174]  And that's just one of many thousands of examples.
[00:25:48.274 --> 00:25:54.936]  Harlan, the administration and the mainstream media in lockstep have been accusing the Russians of hacking the election, of hacking the DNC.
[00:25:54.996 --> 00:25:58.277]  Now they're hacking a state power grid, as you say.
[00:25:58.697 --> 00:26:03.099]  Why do you think they're so hell-bent on making Americans believe that the Russians are the bad guys?
[00:26:04.349 --> 00:26:24.401]  Well, in WikiLeaks, we actually saw this, that way back in the early days of the campaign, Podesta and people at the DNC had all been talking about how Trump did not poll very well because he had said some nice things about Putin, even way back in the early days of his Republican presidential campaign in the Republican primary.
[00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:30.244]  And so they pinpointed this as something that they could exploit as a potential political weakness of Donald Trump.
[00:26:30.945 --> 00:26:32.586]  And so this has been
[00:26:34.325 --> 00:26:35.126]  18 months in the making?
[00:26:35.186 --> 00:26:36.147]  This is not anything new.
[00:26:36.668 --> 00:26:41.253]  And actually, I, you know, I went on, um, I, okay, I remember one example in particular.
[00:26:41.273 --> 00:26:44.156]  I went, I was on CNN before the election, October 20th.
[00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:53.926]  And I said that the reason that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta are pushing this Russian narrative is because they want to plant seeds of doubt in the event Donald Trump won.
[00:26:54.947 --> 00:27:00.130]  And they laughed at me first because they thought it was ridiculous for me to suggest that Donald Trump would win.
[00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:12.316]  But they also suggested that I was un-American for implying that the United States government could plant misinformation to advantage one political side.
[00:27:12.876 --> 00:27:17.439]  And I think that I've been vindicated because even to this day, there's not a shred
[00:27:17.979 --> 00:27:28.466]  And I watched the testimony on the Hill, and there's still to this day not a shred of evidence to substantiate the claim that the Russians were involved in the hacking of anybody's emails.
[00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:33.230]  And even if they were, nobody's proven why that would be significant in any way.
[00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.771]  They didn't alter the emails.
[00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:40.355]  They've just put sunlight on the nefarious activities of Clinton and her associates.
[00:27:42.216 --> 00:27:49.879]  What do you think about, okay, so the mainstream media, they're purveyors of the view that we're conspiracy theorists, we need to be censored, that we're fake news.
[00:27:50.459 --> 00:28:02.004]  Wouldn't that be, you know, anybody looking at this, the real conspiracy theorists, not doing their homework, no journalistic standards, just, you know, lapdogs for a narrative that hasn't even been proven true.
[00:28:02.024 --> 00:28:06.266]  You know, why do you think they've been allowed to get away with it as long as they have?
[00:28:06.986 --> 00:28:08.206]  Well, they're the only game in town.
[00:28:08.647 --> 00:28:09.647]  They're the only game in town.
[00:28:11.713 --> 00:28:14.034]  Unfortunately, this isn't even good for Democrats.
[00:28:14.054 --> 00:28:16.294]  At this point, I don't even know if I am a Democrat anymore.
[00:28:16.334 --> 00:28:17.054]  I know I'm moderate.
[00:28:17.074 --> 00:28:18.275]  I think the party has changed.
[00:28:18.775 --> 00:28:34.698]  But the media being complicit and acting on behalf of Democratic operatives, in fact, I think many people in the media are Democratic operatives in one way or another, has led to the wholesale decline of the Democratic Party.
[00:28:36.418 --> 00:28:42.641]  Republicans have won the White House in probably one of the greatest strategic upsets in the Electoral College ever.
[00:28:44.122 --> 00:28:45.382]  Republicans have 52 senators.
[00:28:45.722 --> 00:28:48.243]  Republicans have 241 members of the House of Representatives.
[00:28:48.563 --> 00:28:49.904]  Republicans have 31 governors.
[00:28:50.404 --> 00:28:54.466]  Republicans totally control 32 state legislatures, and they share control in others.
[00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:57.948]  So the Democratic Party is in total decline.
[00:28:58.248 --> 00:28:58.969]  It has no leader.
[00:28:59.129 --> 00:28:59.990]  It has no message.
[00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.731]  It has no clear common voice.
[00:29:02.352 --> 00:29:03.632]  It is a total disaster.
[00:29:03.652 --> 00:29:24.208]  And the media was responsible for planting these seeds of hysteria that have taken the Democratic Party by storm and has clouded the Democratic mindset so that they are totally incapable of honestly assessing what has happened to the party and realizing that they have been taken over by corporate globalists that don't advantage the American middle class at all.
[00:29:24.688 --> 00:29:24.948]  At all.
[00:29:25.668 --> 00:29:36.073]  In fact, I believe that Donald Trump, and this is why I supported him, has more in common with old school classical liberal values than anybody in recent history that's run for president.
[00:29:36.553 --> 00:29:39.634]  And so the media was responsible for that hysteria.
[00:29:39.954 --> 00:29:45.256]  And because they're incapable of properly covering the Democratic side, I mean, the Democrats have just run amok.
[00:29:45.276 --> 00:29:46.077]  They're out of control.
[00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.917]  They're not responsive to the American people.
[00:29:48.518 --> 00:29:48.718]  And so
[00:29:49.878 --> 00:29:51.939]  You know, it's a double-edged sword.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:30:00.104]  Is it great that the media is able to get away from this for Democrats for a long time and Obama was able to be reelected and Democrats probably love that?
[00:30:00.184 --> 00:30:00.464]  Sure.
[00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:04.126]  But their chickens have come home to roost and it's not sustainable.
[00:30:04.266 --> 00:30:05.667]  You cannot fool people forever.
[00:30:07.182 --> 00:30:13.931]  And even following the news, Harlan, as much as we have this morning, we've been covering this case of this mentally disabled man in Chicago.
[00:30:13.971 --> 00:30:16.174]  He was severely beaten and kidnapped by four people.
[00:30:16.595 --> 00:30:17.976]  They made him denounce Trump.
[00:30:18.217 --> 00:30:21.521]  Do you think the media has any culpability in cases like that?
[00:30:22.142 --> 00:30:22.743]  We're good to go.
[00:30:46.124 --> 00:31:05.441]  Well, you know, in the aftermath of the election, as part of that wave of hysteria that came after the election, they were pushing this story that conservatives were targeting liberals, that they were, you know, painting swastikas all over the place, that minorities were being attacked in the subway and in the street.
[00:31:05.481 --> 00:31:08.423]  And I believe that some of that did happen.
[00:31:09.346 --> 00:31:12.428]  But we know that many of those stories have been debunked.
[00:31:13.229 --> 00:31:22.195]  And so what it does, in terms of conservatives targeting liberals, is that when it actually does happen, it undermines the real cases of it.
[00:31:22.575 --> 00:31:25.738]  Because the media doesn't do their homework and they just believe everything that they say.
[00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:30.761]  When it's liberals attacking conservatives, there's almost zero coverage of that.
[00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:46.389]  And so what happens is I believe that there's this culture of where people think that it's impossible that somebody that's, you know, conservative or white or male could fall victim to this kind of violence that's politically motivated, that's racially motivated.
[00:31:46.809 --> 00:31:53.173]  They think they push this narrative that one side has a monopoly on this kind of behavior.
[00:31:53.353 --> 00:31:54.193]  And it's just not true.
[00:31:54.334 --> 00:31:55.374]  It happens on both sides.
[00:31:55.494 --> 00:32:04.119]  I mean, it's just a fact that people, there are a lot of bad people and no single political movement or race has a monopoly on that.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:13.685]  You think the mainstream media, so if they just keep perpetuating, you mentioned this before, that in this post-election environment, their goal now is to undermine a Trump presidency.
[00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:18.428]  At what point do they become so irrelevant that there's an extinction that happens?
[00:32:18.528 --> 00:32:20.269]  Or do you think that that's ever going to happen?
[00:32:21.061 --> 00:32:26.024]  In many ways, I think that the mainstream media is dying, not just because of politics, but because they haven't modernized at all.
[00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:28.466]  The economics of the business are changing fast.
[00:32:28.806 --> 00:32:30.467]  You know, I really appreciate that analysis.
[00:32:30.507 --> 00:32:39.633]  So, but in terms of perpetuating these lies, Harlan, which is what we're seeing them do, at what point did they become so defunct that they're not relevant, that they can't do it anymore?
[00:32:39.653 --> 00:32:41.234]  Do you think we're ever going to reach that point?
[00:32:42.014 --> 00:32:42.755]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:32:42.815 --> 00:32:48.098]  I think that all time, we've reached an all time low in terms of how many people will actually trust the mainstream media.
[00:32:48.158 --> 00:32:49.359]  They can't sustain this forever.
[00:32:49.906 --> 00:32:50.206]  Got it.
[00:32:50.987 --> 00:32:55.249]  Alright, well that was Harlan Hill, Democratic Strategist and Democrats for Trump.
[00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:57.170]  You can check him out at harlanhill.com.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:06.729]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks.
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.

[00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:00.653]  Make our bodies great again.

[00:36:10.382 --> 00:36:18.125]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:36:18.325 --> 00:36:23.126]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:28.748]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:36.631]  Seeker 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.333]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:36:41.594 --> 00:36:50.437]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:36:50.618 --> 00:36:53.859]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.414]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.803]  Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions is not a racist.
[00:37:11.844 --> 00:37:12.744]  That's the bottom line.
[00:37:12.784 --> 00:37:19.130]  Now, Democrats on the Hill, he's sitting before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting that confirmation as we speak.
[00:37:19.371 --> 00:37:25.977]  And they know that they don't have the votes to block him, but what they're trying to do is dirty up the Senator enough
[00:37:26.517 --> 00:37:26.677]  I don't
[00:37:42.543 --> 00:37:43.264]  We're good to go.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:05.200]  That's
[00:38:23.335 --> 00:38:23.976]  We're good to go.
[00:38:49.674 --> 00:38:51.076]  This is the bottom line here, folks.
[00:38:51.096 --> 00:38:53.258]  They're trying to paint him as a racist for two reasons.
[00:38:53.578 --> 00:38:55.180]  The Hillary Clinton factor is one.
[00:38:55.661 --> 00:39:07.373]  The second one is Jeff Sessions is staunchly pro-life and sitting in the number one seat in the country, the number one judiciary seat in the country, the number one prosecutor in the country, if you will.
[00:39:08.414 --> 00:39:16.861]  He has a lot of say in how money is spent and recommendations before Congress, and they understand that he's a pro-life person.
[00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:21.645]  He's a pro-life Christian, and he's going to act as such as Attorney General of the United States.
[00:39:21.725 --> 00:39:27.089]  Now, we know that Obamacare is on the table, and Republicans have already promised to dismantle that.
[00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:31.013]  Of course, they're using the tax code as a reason why there might be some hang-ups in that.
[00:39:31.633 --> 00:39:31.873]  I don't
[00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.010]  That's what's at stake here, folks.
[00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:58.513]  We can't have people that are pro-life and have pro-family values holding these seats, which is why there is an all-out war going on to paint him as this ridiculous racist.
[00:39:58.573 --> 00:40:10.255]  Now, I want to take you to an article that I found and it talks about how, and this is an old one, it talks about how, this was in the Huffington Post, Jeff Sessions was deemed too racist to be a federal judge.
[00:40:10.895 --> 00:40:12.956]  He'll now be Trump's Attorney General.
[00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:18.479]  I just want to take you to this article and break some of it down because it is so ridiculous.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:24.524]  And the way that they write, this was written by the senior justice reporter for HuffPo, Ryan J. Riley.
[00:40:25.344 --> 00:40:35.111]  And it goes on to mulling and to throw the same mud that he's seeing right now before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:40:35.631 --> 00:40:40.175]  And it talks about anecdotally how Jeff Sessions was affable and he wanted a cup of coffee.
[00:40:40.235 --> 00:40:41.476]  Ridiculous nonsense.
[00:40:42.116 --> 00:40:52.482]  And then it paints this picture of Sessions in this 1986 transcript in a confirmation hearing, because he was sitting on Capitol Hill as a senator at that time.
[00:40:52.863 --> 00:40:55.664]  And I'll let you read this for yourself, but it's the same byline.
[00:40:55.945 --> 00:40:56.885]  He's a racist.
[00:40:56.925 --> 00:40:58.226]  He's anti-civil rights.
[00:40:58.266 --> 00:40:58.986]  He's a bigot.
[00:40:59.046 --> 00:41:01.948]  He's, you know what, it has nothing to do with us folks.
[00:41:02.108 --> 00:41:04.490]  It's the fact that he is staunchly pro-life.
[00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:08.392]  And he possibly could lead a criminal indictment against Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:08.412 --> 00:41:09.312]  That's what's on the table.
[00:41:09.392 --> 00:41:18.337]  So, we know that we've got Senator Cory Booker coming out swinging against him and questioning his position on Muslims entering the country.
[00:41:19.117 --> 00:41:26.221]  We know that Cory Booker has been very outspoken against Jeff Sessions and they're trying to tar and feather him, paint him as a racist.
[00:41:26.601 --> 00:41:33.945]  Meanwhile, the real racist going on here, there's an article up, it's on the Daily Caller, this MTV producer, host,
[00:41:34.585 --> 00:41:41.691]  is mocking Jeff Sessions because of course the confirmation is underway and Jeff Sessions happens to have an Asian grandchild.
[00:41:42.132 --> 00:41:45.515]  I want to take you directly to this tweet and it is ridiculous.
[00:41:45.555 --> 00:41:46.315]  It's so nasty.
[00:41:46.836 --> 00:41:54.722]  Ira Madison III, there is no reason for a child to be in his lap and hearing other than to send an I'm not racist message.
[00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:56.184]  This was tweeted out at 930 this morning.
[00:41:58.025 --> 00:42:06.647]  And he's pointing out the fact that Ruth Sessions, Jeff Sessions' wife, is holding one of their Asian American granddaughters.
[00:42:06.667 --> 00:42:20.030]  They have four Asian American granddaughters, you know, which is indicative of the fact that the man is not culturally closed off and clearly loves his grandchildren, which are a different ethnicity than he is.
[00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:25.171]  Now, black pastors, they're rallying around Jeff Sessions as we speak.
[00:42:25.951 --> 00:42:28.273]  And this is taking place on Capitol Hill.
[00:42:29.054 --> 00:42:38.902]  A group of black pastors yesterday, they're criticizing the opponents of Jeff Sessions for trying to demonize him and misrepresent his character.
[00:42:39.322 --> 00:42:44.566]  And they're saying, look, they believe that he shows respect and care for people of all races.
[00:42:44.606 --> 00:42:52.273]  And these ministers, they're holding out support, this large crowd, against the opponents of Jeff Sessions as we speak.
[00:42:52.873 --> 00:43:03.382]  And namely, the opponents of him are the NAACP and other congregations that believe the narrative that Jeff Sessions holds racist views.
[00:43:03.462 --> 00:43:13.531]  Now, I want to take you to Glenn Beck for a minute, not to go off topic here, but Glenn Beck, to me, it's very hard for me to listen to Glenn Beck for longer than two seconds, honestly.
[00:43:13.871 --> 00:43:19.096]  Well, Glenn Beck, you know, it's my belief that he is a sellout and he's talking about Trump.
[00:43:19.136 --> 00:43:22.419]  If you recall, the Trump bashing was off the charts all year long.
[00:43:22.439 --> 00:43:26.083]  He was crying and sniffling, blubbering like a baby.
[00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:32.009]  It's difficult to even understand Glenn Beck sometimes because his logic is just really twisted for me.
[00:43:32.529 --> 00:43:34.351]  And I'm of the belief that he doesn't represent
[00:43:34.811 --> 00:43:36.592]  He doesn't represent Christians in this country, frankly.
[00:43:36.612 --> 00:43:37.692]  He doesn't represent the Tea Party.
[00:43:37.712 --> 00:43:40.393]  He doesn't represent conservative values or liberty.
[00:43:40.613 --> 00:43:49.696]  And so when he questions Jeff Sessions and Trump nominees, to me, that makes me tend to trust the nominee and not Glenn Beck.
[00:43:50.976 --> 00:43:56.541]  And he's not the only one that's had a difficult time with the Trump victory and subsequent Trump appointees.
[00:43:57.221 --> 00:43:59.503]  We've seen a slew of celebrities.
[00:43:59.563 --> 00:44:05.369]  I know this week the Golden Globes have been replayed and replayed and replayed because of Meryl Streep.
[00:44:05.969 --> 00:44:13.656]  And to me, she really represents something that is not indicative of American values or the majority of the American people.
[00:44:14.236 --> 00:44:18.538]  And she seems to come from a very misinformed place, in my opinion.
[00:44:18.918 --> 00:44:20.199]  It was difficult to hear that speech.
[00:44:20.239 --> 00:44:21.699]  We've been replaying it here on InfoWars.
[00:44:21.719 --> 00:44:24.521]  I know Alex has done several segments over Meryl Streep.
[00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:35.105]  And to me, she's this, you know, a high priestess lecturing the peasants about morality from her, you know, ivory tower from her temple.
[00:44:35.226 --> 00:44:42.429]  And she's really out of touch with how most Americans feel and how the suffering that's taken place under Barack Obama, the lack of joblessness,
[00:44:43.369 --> 00:44:43.769]  I don't
[00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:17.733]  She's talking about how the Trump presidency is like a bad breakup for her.
[00:45:18.554 --> 00:45:25.601]  She goes in to talk about how she wakes up every morning and it's like you break up with somebody and you have this really broken heart.
[00:45:25.661 --> 00:45:26.682]  She's in a nightmare.
[00:45:26.702 --> 00:45:30.005]  You know, it's just really bizarre, really.
[00:45:30.425 --> 00:45:31.305]  We're good to go.
[00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:56.111]  I put this up on Twitter.
[00:45:56.131 --> 00:45:59.732]  I encourage you to take a look at this tweet when you get a chance at Margaret J. Howell.
[00:46:00.152 --> 00:46:04.014]  It's of the soldier who's missing his arm and Trump is touching his face.
[00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:05.854]  That's the Trump voter, folks.
[00:46:06.054 --> 00:46:08.175]  It's not the racist.
[00:46:08.315 --> 00:46:12.156]  And they're still using this narrative and they're trying to tar and feather Jeff Sessions with it.
[00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:16.317]  We need to send a message to the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:46:16.337 --> 00:46:19.058]  Hey, this tar and feathering is not going to work.
[00:46:19.078 --> 00:46:20.278]  You're going to try to dirty him up.
[00:46:20.618 --> 00:46:22.319]  But in the end, he's still going to go through.
[00:46:22.839 --> 00:46:25.021]  And we know the real reason why you're doing it.
[00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:27.283]  It has nothing to do with being a racist.
[00:46:27.663 --> 00:46:32.207]  It has everything to do with his personal beliefs, his Christianity, and the fact that he's pro-life.
[00:46:32.887 --> 00:46:36.210]  For more reports like this, be sure to check out our website, Infowars.com.

[00:46:40.894 --> 00:46:43.996]  I'm going to be hosting the Nightly News tomorrow night, Wednesday.
[00:46:44.196 --> 00:46:44.817]  I'll see you there.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:02.292]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:06.308 --> 00:49:14.471]  Well, we're just 10 days out from Donald Trump's inauguration, and anarchists are hoping to turn this inauguration into the biggest riots in U.S.
[00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:15.071]  history.
[00:49:15.391 --> 00:49:24.134]  We've got thousands of people actively saying that they're going to be taking to the streets, not just there in D.C., but in a lot of states throughout the nation.
[00:49:25.234 --> 00:49:34.605]  These are activists, journalists, scientists, entertainers, prominent voices, all calling for a no, no, we will not accept a fascist president.
[00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:39.170]  So we are going to beat you and bludgeon you to death and disallow you to speak.
[00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:40.571]  Well, my thing is,
[00:49:41.252 --> 00:49:46.696]  Donald Trump isn't the one who has put you in the dire straits where you feel as if you have no hope.
[00:49:47.036 --> 00:49:55.322]  In fact, Donald Trump hasn't even been elected yet and he's already creating jobs and bringing hope back to, say, small businesses.
[00:49:55.823 --> 00:49:59.986]  Owen, what do you have to say about, you know, how are things looking?
[00:50:00.879 --> 00:50:07.027]  Well, they're not looking good if you're an anti-Trump protester if you're a leftist, and we'll get into that in a second.
[00:50:07.507 --> 00:50:15.697]  But, if you're a realist and you like making money, well then, you know what, so far the Trump effect has not been so bad to you.
[00:50:16.238 --> 00:50:17.599]  Now, this was an amazing story.
[00:50:17.659 --> 00:50:20.842]  We're seeing confidence skyrocket in the housing market.
[00:50:20.902 --> 00:50:23.845]  We're seeing records hit almost daily in the stock market.
[00:50:24.306 --> 00:50:25.347]  Now, this was amazing.
[00:50:25.687 --> 00:50:26.668]  This is from Bloomberg.
[00:50:26.768 --> 00:50:28.129]  I'm sure they didn't like admitting this.
[00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:28.910]  U.S.
[00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:32.954]  small business optimism index surges by most since 1980.
[00:50:33.414 --> 00:50:34.755]  If you actually look at this graphic,
[00:50:35.376 --> 00:50:37.398]  You can see the unbelievable surge.
[00:50:37.438 --> 00:50:42.624]  It's actually probably the biggest surge ever in the history of this optimism index.
[00:50:42.724 --> 00:50:46.248]  And it's also close to reaching record highs.
[00:50:46.389 --> 00:50:51.314]  An amazing boom in confidence since the election of Donald Trump.
[00:50:51.354 --> 00:50:52.135]  Now here's another thing.
[00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:55.659]  Apple seeks to expand manufacturing in Arizona.
[00:50:56.562 --> 00:51:00.105]  Apple is seeking to conduct high-tech manufacturing at one of its American plants.
[00:51:00.785 --> 00:51:02.006]  This is in Mesa, Arizona.
[00:51:02.086 --> 00:51:22.040]  Now, Leanne, this plan was actually in place a few years ago, but what I think is going on here, I think we're seeing the Trump effect where these businesses, whether it be car businesses, tech manufacturing businesses, they want to have their name put on the map with this new rising nationalism saying, hey,
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:30.144]  We make our products in America, and they feel like there's a market for that now, and they want to tap into that market where people are saying, hey, you know what?
[00:51:30.604 --> 00:51:34.406]  Ford just kept their cars being manufactured in America.
[00:51:34.546 --> 00:51:35.727]  I think I'm going to go buy Ford.
[00:51:36.047 --> 00:51:41.830]  Hey, Apple isn't building this phone at a slave labor camp at Foxconn in China.
[00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:43.631]  Maybe they built this in Arizona.
[00:51:43.651 --> 00:51:45.591]  Maybe I'm going to go buy this iPhone now.
[00:51:45.991 --> 00:51:56.015]  So I think that there's this new Trump effect where businesses are going to be using this as kind of a marketing ploy like, hey, we're American, we're nationalists, we now make our products in America.
[00:51:56.445 --> 00:52:05.951]  Well, and see, this is the thing that I think is so interesting about having someone who's very successful in business kind of in charge of the country, especially when we're dealing with such massive debt.
[00:52:06.491 --> 00:52:09.873]  And we're all kind of sitting here on the sidelines going, what the heck?
[00:52:09.973 --> 00:52:18.178]  Why are you making it so attractive for these corporations to take their business outside of this country to give all the jobs outside of the country and
[00:52:18.818 --> 00:52:21.621]  Oh, also, you're giving them tons of tax breaks.
[00:52:21.861 --> 00:52:28.147]  So not only are they creating jobs outside of the U.S., but now they're not even paying any taxes here for those benefits.
[00:52:28.247 --> 00:52:28.868]  So who knew?
[00:52:29.328 --> 00:52:32.992]  You know, having someone who'd get in there and make it attractive to do business in the United States.
[00:52:33.232 --> 00:52:34.373]  Who knew that would work?
[00:52:34.773 --> 00:52:43.762]  Which is why when I see this story coming out of the Telegraph, half of young people have so many emotional problems, they cannot focus at school.
[00:52:44.142 --> 00:52:50.525]  And now I'm not talking about just your social justice warriors who are just totally bogged down with what gender identity they want to be called.
[00:52:50.985 --> 00:52:54.066]  These are kids who are genuinely concerned.
[00:52:54.106 --> 00:52:58.969]  I mean, they are dealing with one of the largest, the worst job prospects in decades.
[00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:01.070]  They're wondering, am I ever going to have a job?
[00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:04.071]  Am I going to even be able to pay for this college education that I'm getting?
[00:53:05.032 --> 00:53:26.529]  And so this is why we're seeing these kind of anarchists and these well-funded George Soros-type groups trying to rally these young people to blame Donald Trump or to blame white people or to blame racism and put the blame for these terrible job prospects on whatever else it is, not the bad legislation that we've had in this country.
[00:53:26.889 --> 00:53:35.781]  Oh, you mean like when they were complaining about Donald Trump using the tax evasion thing that was actually a bill passed by Bill Clinton?
[00:53:36.242 --> 00:53:42.590]  Or how they complain about incarceration rates, black people versus white people, when that bill was also from Bill Clinton?
[00:53:43.211 --> 00:53:44.613]  So, you know, that's just what we have here.
[00:53:44.733 --> 00:53:48.597]  But, you know, we'll get into the you might be a liberal if in a second here.
[00:53:48.737 --> 00:53:49.238]  But you know what?
[00:53:49.278 --> 00:53:50.099]  Here's the thing, Leanne.
[00:53:50.439 --> 00:53:52.121]  They're totally failing right now.
[00:53:52.181 --> 00:53:52.482]  OK?
[00:53:53.343 --> 00:53:54.684]  Democrats helpless.
[00:53:54.824 --> 00:53:55.285]  That's right.
[00:53:55.645 --> 00:53:58.048]  Helpless as Jeff Sessions heads to the Hill.
[00:53:58.428 --> 00:53:59.390]  Now, this is amazing to me.
[00:54:00.947 --> 00:54:03.549]  There have been multiple videos surfacing of Jeff Sessions.
[00:54:03.849 --> 00:54:04.989]  It's the same thing with Donald Trump.
[00:54:05.149 --> 00:54:10.693]  Jeff Sessions has been fighting for civil rights in the South before it was popular, okay?
[00:54:10.973 --> 00:54:17.617]  He's had multiple black congressmen and senators come out and say, I worked with Jeff Sessions, okay?
[00:54:17.657 --> 00:54:20.338]  This is a good, honorable man with kindness in his heart.
[00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:22.980]  I can't believe they're still protesting this guy's a racist!
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.761]  Well, because they're building their protests on lies and mistruths.
[00:54:27.821 --> 00:54:36.663]  And they're allowing these lies to kind of fill these people's heads by saying, oh, well, he was targeting black activists who were trying to sign black people up to vote.
[00:54:37.143 --> 00:54:43.545]  No, they were actually committing voter fraud when they were trying to get these black people signed up to vote.
[00:54:43.785 --> 00:54:45.025]  They were committing voter fraud.
[00:54:45.045 --> 00:54:46.385]  And so that's what he was faced with.
[00:54:46.726 --> 00:54:48.446]  But people are going to say, no, you're just racist.
[00:54:48.846 --> 00:54:49.947]  And you know, I just don't get it.
[00:54:49.987 --> 00:54:54.292]  These are the liberals, and we would all agree, everyone works better together.
[00:54:54.593 --> 00:54:54.853]  Okay?
[00:54:54.893 --> 00:54:56.415]  Doesn't matter what color your skin is, all this.
[00:54:56.635 --> 00:54:59.378]  But they just cannot get over identity politics.
[00:54:59.398 --> 00:55:00.880]  They have nothing else.
[00:55:01.301 --> 00:55:04.184]  Now, here's some of the liberal failures before we get into the you might be a liberal.
[00:55:04.224 --> 00:55:12.752]  Yes, and I wanted to start this segment by saying these are the same people who are saying, we refuse to accept a fascist America.
[00:55:13.173 --> 00:55:22.422]  So you might be a part of that group if you force publishing houses to take books off the shelf because they're from conservative authors you don't like.
[00:55:22.682 --> 00:55:30.908]  Alright, well how about this, we'll go right into the, I got a whole list of you might be a liberal if, and one of it is if you're totally failing right now, and we've got the stories on that.
[00:55:31.329 --> 00:55:34.211]  You might be a liberal if everyone who disagrees with you is a racist.
[00:55:34.851 --> 00:55:40.035]  You might be a liberal if you're upset at Russia for delivering on the promise of government transparency.
[00:55:40.676 --> 00:55:42.877]  You might be a liberal if you've been paid to protest.
[00:55:43.538 --> 00:55:46.420]  You might be a liberal if you're pro-choice until the child is born.
[00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:50.843]  You might be a liberal if you believe gun control is the answer, but you're protected by guns.
[00:55:51.604 --> 00:55:56.199]  You might be a liberal if you want big money out of politics, but voted for the biggest money candidates.
[00:55:57.247 --> 00:56:01.830]  You might be a liberal if you point out the flaws in your opponents, ignoring the same flaws within your own party.
[00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:06.072]  You might be a liberal if you liked WikiLeaks 8 years ago, but hate it now.
[00:56:07.013 --> 00:56:08.474]  I could go on and on.
[00:56:08.514 --> 00:56:13.117]  You might be a liberal if your house is surrounded by walls, but you tell people how bad walls are.
[00:56:13.277 --> 00:56:19.901]  Yeah, or you're building nice, new, shiny, huge, beautiful walls around your house, President Obama.
[00:56:20.001 --> 00:56:22.302]  You might be a liberal if you believe in 49 genders.
[00:56:23.283 --> 00:56:24.024]  I think there's 72, actually.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.221]  Yeah, well, it goes on.
[00:56:26.261 --> 00:56:26.922]  You might be a liberal.
[00:56:26.942 --> 00:56:27.502]  How about this one?
[00:56:28.243 --> 00:56:35.190]  You might be a liberal if you want to mend relations with radical Islam, but you have no interest in mending relations with Russia.
[00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:35.850]  Russia.
[00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:36.591]  How do you like that?
[00:56:36.651 --> 00:56:43.978]  Who, as far as I can tell, isn't terrorizing entire regions of the world, molesting people, chopping people's heads off.
[00:56:44.358 --> 00:56:52.324]  If you agree with professors who are calling for white people to have individual reparations accounts.
[00:56:52.624 --> 00:57:05.072]  So white people need to have separate accounts set up where we specifically will just pay for, you know, whatever kind of black institutions and individuals, whatever they want to have paid for that.
[00:57:05.152 --> 00:57:06.653]  I mean, ignore it.
[00:57:06.673 --> 00:57:10.396]  Like, cause you know, cause there might be somebody who came from Africa
[00:57:11.156 --> 00:57:15.480]  After the abolishment of slavery, you know, so they have nothing to do with that at all.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:19.644]  They don't even, they can't even wrap their minds around, you might be a liberal if you can't wrap your mind around that logic.
[00:57:19.724 --> 00:57:31.896]  Or that every, every country in the world since the beginning of time has been conquered and has had slaves and all of that, it's, it's, I'm not making excuses, it's super messed up, but that's just how our world operates, unfortunately.
[00:57:32.316 --> 00:57:42.787]  Meanwhile, the United States of America and white people were the first people to abolish slavery and say, this is a terrible thing, let's stop doing this, and hey, why don't you guys stop doing that too?
[00:57:43.067 --> 00:57:51.535]  Well, except for President Obama, who wanted to rewrite the TPP, so they could still use slave labor to make their very cheap products, and of course, keep our jobs overseas.
[00:57:52.196 --> 00:58:00.179]  You also might be crazy lefty liberal logic if you demand white philosophers are removed from the syllabus.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:01.540]  Removed entirely!
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:10.283]  Okay, so just Plato, Aristotle, Voltaire, all of these people banned from the philosophy syllabus because they are white.
[00:58:10.744 --> 00:58:12.905]  Now, you know, I'm not against including other
[00:58:13.985 --> 00:58:16.446]  You might be a liberal if you're more upset with Trump than a kidnapping and a torture.
[00:58:16.566 --> 00:58:18.867]  You might be a liberal if Milo Yiannopoulos triggers you, you know?
[00:58:36.226 --> 00:58:37.967]  That's this story I have here.
[00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:44.773]  Publishers encounter political storms because they dared to give Milo Yiannopoulos a book deal.
[00:58:44.793 --> 00:58:45.693]  A book deal!
[00:58:45.914 --> 00:58:47.555]  How dare you!
[00:58:47.835 --> 00:58:49.196]  How dare you, free speech!
[00:58:49.556 --> 00:58:50.157]  Is this America?
[00:58:50.257 --> 00:58:50.977]  Do we still live in America?
[00:58:51.218 --> 00:58:51.858]  I don't even know.
[00:58:52.238 --> 00:58:54.560]  Well, thank you guys so much for tuning in to the show tonight.
