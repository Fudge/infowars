[00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.645]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:22.847]  It is Monday the 23rd of January 2017.
[00:00:22.887 --> 00:00:26.430]  I'm Leanne McAdoo and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.812]  The TPP is dead.
[00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:40.993]  President Donald Trump signed an executive order today to withdraw from the globalist trade deal.
[00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:51.756]  Meanwhile, Trump's campaign promises for day one go right as planned, as he begins to repeal the illegal executive orders from the Obama administration.
[00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:54.657]  Good morning, Mr. President.
[00:00:57.814 --> 00:00:58.914]  Okay, sit down, please.
[00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:11.317]  Highlights from the nationwide Women's March on Saturday, where the herd mentality was on full display in their unified march towards idiocracy.
[00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:13.657]  Who did I assault?
[00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:23.179]  All that plus much more, up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:09.012]  Well, if you feel like you've been living in an alternative version of reality lately, you are not alone.
[00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:10.533]  And here's something that's going to shock you.
[00:03:10.693 --> 00:03:12.375]  It shocked all of us here at InfoWars.
[00:03:12.716 --> 00:03:18.902]  We're actually dealing with a politician, a president, who is following through on his campaign promises.
[00:03:19.323 --> 00:03:20.384]  This is not satire.
[00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:21.945]  Kit Daniels has the story.
[00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:24.808]  Trump wrestles control from the trilateral elite.
[00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.112]  So this is an unprecedented move for this politician.
[00:03:28.513 --> 00:03:32.859]  Donald Trump campaigned on the fact that he was going to do away with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.980]  He campaigned on this.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.330]  A lot of people on both sides of the aisle, Bernie Sanders supporters as well as Donald Trump supporters, were very concerned about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.950]  I think so.
[00:03:56.787 --> 00:03:56.987]  Yes.
[00:04:13.172 --> 00:04:37.130]  And this is exactly why the mainstream media doesn't want to talk to you about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and frankly they want to keep everyone distracted all weekend with the crowd size that was or wasn't and all these pictures going around and these memes that are made because they don't want anyone to focus on the fact that Donald Trump is keeping true to his campaign promises on something specifically that both sides of the aisle can agree upon.
[00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.433]  So that is why you're seeing this massive diversion from this.
[00:04:40.993 --> 00:04:50.461]  Now, one of the things that Kit Daniels points out in this article is that Obama quietly removed an anti-slavery provision from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:58.128]  This is so countries that engage in slavery, like Malaysia, would take part in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:04:58.428 --> 00:05:00.530]  So this is a pro-slavery stance.
[00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:11.037]  It's not really a trade deal, but it's an enabling act to allow transnational corporations to dump American workers and erode U.S.
[00:05:11.117 --> 00:05:12.218]  economic independence.
[00:05:12.758 --> 00:05:16.681]  Kit Daniels points out that this is all part of the Trilateral Commission's plan.
[00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:22.144]  They groomed Obama, and their plan is to secretly seize control of the U.S.
[00:05:22.164 --> 00:05:23.165]  government from within.
[00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:26.287]  And the sole intention would be to break down U.S.
[00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:32.834]  national sovereignty and economic might to make way for the North American Union, much like the EU.
[00:05:33.274 --> 00:05:47.529]  So according to a warning from the late Barry Goldwater, the Trilateral Commission is international and it's intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:57.951]  The commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:08.354]  And so we can see very much so how this commission has really kind of worked its way, pretty much anyone that's in power is involved with the Trilateral Commission somehow.
[00:06:08.374 --> 00:06:13.175]  And you see Donald Trump coming in right away and swiping away at one of the legs
[00:06:13.935 --> 00:06:21.442]  Of this globalist agenda, another one of those being immigration and open borders, which he's quickly going to get to as well, that's on his agenda.
[00:06:22.343 --> 00:06:26.526]  But two-thirds of the Trilateral Commission, they're not even U.S.
[00:06:26.967 --> 00:06:29.609]  citizens, yet they're sitting here drafting U.S.
[00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:37.035]  policy and trade deals for the American people that are going to, you know, greatly affect us and they don't even live here.
[00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:38.277]  So it's pretty fantastic.
[00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:55.634]  So, of course, Donald Trump has a very full plate, so he's working on trade, of course, our safety, dealing with ISIS, draining the swamp, and government reform, energy and the environment, healthcare, gun control, as well as immigration, security, and defense.
[00:06:57.035 --> 00:06:58.076]  He's getting right to work.
[00:06:58.236 --> 00:07:02.398]  He has said that he is going to be renegotiating NAFTA with Mexico and Canada.
[00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:12.424]  This deal was intended originally to eliminate most trade tariffs between the three nations, increase investment, and tighten protection and enforcement of intellectual property.
[00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:14.886]  But what's really happened is U.S.
[00:07:14.946 --> 00:07:20.249]  manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico increased 258% under this NAFTA agreement.
[00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:22.710]  And Donald Trump tweeted out,
[00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:29.423]  In October, actually, he said, I will renegotiate NAFTA.
[00:07:29.523 --> 00:07:32.424]  If I can't make a great deal, we're going to tear it up.
[00:07:32.584 --> 00:07:34.404]  We're going to get this economy running again.
[00:07:34.864 --> 00:07:35.844]  This was at the debate.
[00:07:36.124 --> 00:07:38.305]  And of course, he's already making good on that.
[00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:43.146]  Now, with a stroke of a pen, he abruptly ended the decades old U.S.
[00:07:43.206 --> 00:07:50.228]  tilt toward free trade by signing this executive order to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:51.269]  I think so.
[00:08:08.832 --> 00:08:09.312]  I don't know.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.040]  I don't
[00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:50.635]  But he's their enemy.
[00:08:50.775 --> 00:08:52.336]  He's not the enemy of the US people.
[00:08:52.416 --> 00:09:03.640]  So you really have to watch how the mainstream media is trying to paint this, just like we've got CNN coming out saying Trump's decision to kill the TPP leaves the door open for China.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.721]  Oh, well, first of all, I think Donald Trump has been making
[00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:18.170]  He's making it very clear for at least a good year now that he's absolutely aware of China and that China's trying to move in and that China has been getting the better of us for decades.
[00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.572]  So I don't think he's going to let them get in and leave the door open.
[00:09:23.031 --> 00:09:38.986]  But this is how they're kind of framing this, is that with his withdrawal from the TPP, the Chinese president actually just said at the World Economic Forum last week that he would defend globalization against populist forces that want to end free trade.
[00:09:39.406 --> 00:09:47.153]  So now they're saying that Donald Trump, by withdrawing from the TPP, just handed over the car keys and threw in a free tank of gas.
[00:09:48.534 --> 00:09:58.201]  But this is the thing, is that CNN was a part of this whole machine that was working to protect President Obama and his agenda, and protect the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:17.775]  They refused to even report on it, especially when so many people on both sides of the aisle were very concerned about this trade deal, that it would knock away our sovereignty, it wouldn't protect the American worker, we would just see giant sucking sound of even more jobs being pulled away, with absolutely no plan of how to protect the American worker,
[00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:18.495]  I think?
[00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:49.379]  When CNN tells you what a terrible thing this is that Trump has done for the American people, that's what you need to understand who you're really dealing with, is people who have been protecting the globalists and their agenda all along.
[00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:52.821]  With immigration, you know, we've got these sanctuary cities.
[00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:55.703]  Our own Texas governor here, Governor Abbott,
[00:10:56.804 --> 00:11:01.870]  Is challenging a county sheriff that we have here in Austin, Texas, actually.
[00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:04.313]  They talk about this sanctuary city.
[00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:07.837]  This is Sheriff Sally Hernandez.
[00:11:07.997 --> 00:11:12.262]  She's going to be refusing to cooperate with the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
[00:11:12.282 --> 00:11:13.284]  And he's saying, look, you know,
[00:11:13.804 --> 00:11:28.379]  You were sworn an oath to protect the safety of the citizens that you are there to protect, and by not alerting ICE when you have people who are here illegally, it's just allowing some of these criminals to get back out onto the streets.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.743]  Now, I know this is maybe not popular with some of you out there.
[00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:36.447]  I truly wish that there is something they can do to make sure that people who aren't
[00:11:37.308 --> 00:11:38.489]  You're bad guys.
[00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:45.853]  Like, focus on the people who really are criminals, who really are gang members, who are really, you know, getting away with DUIs and things.
[00:11:46.214 --> 00:11:46.934]  Focus on them.
[00:11:47.434 --> 00:11:56.420]  I don't think we need to just anyone, you know, all that does is it stops people who are here illegally or who are afraid of maybe their family member getting deported.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.822]  It stops them from going to the police and reporting crimes.
[00:12:00.142 --> 00:12:04.885]  So I do think that we need to be able to kind of focus our energies with this policy.
[00:12:04.945 --> 00:12:05.786]  But at the same time,
[00:12:06.306 --> 00:12:11.688]  We don't need to have these sanctuary cities where you're basically telling these criminal elements, come here, you'll be safe.
[00:12:11.748 --> 00:12:12.729]  We won't send you to ICE.
[00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.030]  So we're definitely kind of seeing a coup there.
[00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.711]  But then back to, you know, some more things on Trump's agenda.
[00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.472]  He's already bringing the jobs back.
[00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:24.353]  He's made it attractive to do business in America again.
[00:12:24.654 --> 00:12:30.116]  And we've got supermarket chain Kroger saying they're going to be filling 10,000 permanent positions.
[00:12:30.856 --> 00:12:35.919]  We've got the Foxconn CEO saying investments for display.
[00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:38.761]  This is one of the world's largest contract electronics maker.
[00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:41.442]  They're considering setting up a plant in the U.S.
[00:12:41.522 --> 00:12:43.683]  that would exceed $7 billion.
[00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:44.484]  Here, take a listen.
[00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:53.572]  Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, is considering setting up a display panel producing plant in the United States.
[00:12:53.712 --> 00:12:59.953]  According to its chief executive, there'd be an investment of more than seven billion dollars, six and a half billion euros.
[00:13:00.313 --> 00:13:06.774]  Reportedly, it could be a joint venture with Apple, for which it makes the majority of the iPhones and iPads that are produced.
[00:13:07.114 --> 00:13:14.816]  Foxconn's CEO and chairman, Terry Goh, speaking at a company event in Taiwan, said Foxconn has been considering such a move for years.
[00:13:15.526 --> 00:13:18.149]  That's what he means when he says he's going to put America first.
[00:13:18.169 --> 00:13:20.972]  We're going to see these jobs coming back to this country.
[00:13:21.313 --> 00:13:25.718]  He also told business leaders that he wants to cut regulations by 75% or maybe more.
[00:13:28.923 --> 00:13:40.850]  If I gave them a choice of this massive tax decrease that we're giving for business, for everybody but for business, or the cutting down of regulation.
[00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.672]  If I took a vote, I think the regulation wins 100%.
[00:13:45.332 --> 00:13:51.556]  The regulations are going to be cut massively and the taxes are going to be cut way down.
[00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:55.258]  So you're going to have now incentive, incentive to build.
[00:13:55.638 --> 00:13:56.419]  So there you go.
[00:13:56.499 --> 00:14:00.882]  He's going to be cutting these regulations, but he still plans on protecting the American worker.
[00:14:01.323 --> 00:14:09.570]  And according to a new study, $40 billion in midnight regulations is what the Obama administration tried to push through at the last minute.
[00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.390]  $40 billion.
[00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:17.196]  Not only does that stifle job creation in this country, but it disproportionately affects the small business owner.
[00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:21.319]  He was trying to, at the last minute, ensure that you didn't build that.
[00:14:27.231 --> 00:14:28.752]  Donald Trump is over delivering.
[00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:37.696]  Even CNN and others basically came out and said he doubled down, quadrupled down on his populist America first rhetoric.
[00:14:39.037 --> 00:14:41.658]  He signed an executive order that begins the repeal of Obamacare.
[00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:50.542]  He's got the votes of the House and Senate to gut the entire thing and give women off, you know, time to take care of their children and free health care to poor people.
[00:14:51.394 --> 00:14:54.016]  When one would say, what has Trump done for jobs?
[00:14:54.757 --> 00:14:57.319]  And I'd say, well, I would do the litany.
[00:14:57.339 --> 00:14:58.800]  And she'd say, oh, you're making that up.
[00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:04.925]  And I'd say, no, I mean, I'd start showing them on my phone that Chrysler was coming back and forth.
[00:15:05.325 --> 00:15:08.608]  They'd go, well, well, I'm just not going to comment on that.
[00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:11.651]  They'd say, he's a billionaire.
[00:15:12.331 --> 00:15:12.952]  He's rich.
[00:15:14.173 --> 00:15:17.996]  He doesn't care about little people as if there aren't good billionaires and bad billionaires.
[00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:26.771]  Zuckerberg's that calls his users dumb effers and openly wants to enslave the planet versus a Donald Trump that wants to empower people.
[00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:28.552]  And that's the difference here.
[00:15:29.072 --> 00:15:34.795]  Do you understand that it's admitted in congressional hearings that they call it disruptive technologies?
[00:15:34.855 --> 00:15:38.797]  A 200-mile-to-the-gallon carburetor they had 25 years ago.
[00:15:39.918 --> 00:15:41.859]  Hell, 40 years ago they had 100-something-mile.
[00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:46.261]  Solar panels that basically never break, never go out.
[00:15:47.188 --> 00:15:51.009]  And that have five times the gathering capacity of the very best systems today.
[00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:51.949]  Things like that.
[00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:54.389]  They're slowly doling out the technology.
[00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:59.070]  The elites are on incredible power trips, sequestering it for a breakaway civilization.
[00:15:59.471 --> 00:16:01.411]  The future's here, it's just not evenly distributed.
[00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:09.073]  Trump intends to flood the entire planet with true globalism.
[00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:16.014]  With America as the operating system, the true America, not the modern liberal globalist
[00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:35.839]  Eugenics America, but really working with people, really standing up for cultures that have good societies, crushing radical Islam, and transferring to the public, and transferring and ordering the pharmaceutical companies to, no, we're not going to treat all these cancers, you're going to give them the cures.
[00:16:36.179 --> 00:16:41.483]  And when I say cures, some people individually won't respond, but they've got stuff that's 99% effective.
[00:16:42.048 --> 00:16:42.928]  The elites are getting it.
[00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:43.589]  It's how they're living 110, 115.
[00:16:45.089 --> 00:16:47.510]  So if you're educated, informed, you know all this.
[00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:54.893]  And a lot of people under the old globalist model were clamoring to be part of the new civilization that they thought would be separate from humanity.
[00:16:55.133 --> 00:16:58.375]  And if they grovel to the new world order, they would get the cancer treatments.
[00:16:58.415 --> 00:16:59.615]  They would get the life extension.
[00:16:59.915 --> 00:17:05.878]  They could be part of the secret programs and projects that I guess those on Elysium would have access to.
[00:17:07.638 --> 00:17:08.779]  That's not happening now.
[00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:11.339]  If Trump has his way.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:31.087]  The biggest secret of Trump is that he intends to turn loose all these disruptive technologies and to actually let partners have them and to work with Russia and others that also have advanced technologies because he knows a deal was made to let China take over.
[00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:38.635]  with economic warfare and let them control the system, because they'd proven themselves evil, killing over 100 million of their own people.
[00:17:38.896 --> 00:17:41.838]  So our elite went to work with China, just like they had meant last month.
[00:17:42.098 --> 00:17:47.863]  I told you months ago, they'll plan on China propping up world government, China to save this collapsing system.
[00:17:48.023 --> 00:17:53.667]  And then they come out in the news in hundreds of publications, Communist China to save the New World Order and to defeat Trump.
[00:17:53.727 --> 00:17:53.948]  See?
[00:17:54.228 --> 00:17:57.971]  Our own media siding with people that oppress their own population.
[00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:58.772]  People ask,
[00:17:59.605 --> 00:18:03.167]  Especially intelligence agencies and military and others, they go, how does Jones know this?
[00:18:03.187 --> 00:18:06.609]  I had the New York Times walk up to me and say, you had to talk to Trump.
[00:18:06.969 --> 00:18:16.595]  I talked to you and I said, you tweeted that Trump is going to declare the new American century and godly providence and invoke God and take the birthright.
[00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:17.616]  Did you talk to him?
[00:18:18.977 --> 00:18:22.839]  I said, I said, I'm not going to comment because I just talked to him that week.
[00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:25.661]  I said, I said, I didn't talk to him about that.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.361]  I looked at that New York Times guy who was just empty-souled, an intellectual smart, but empty-souled.
[00:18:32.021 --> 00:18:36.762]  And I said, it's the spirit, like the sixth sense, the ether, the brain's internet.
[00:18:36.822 --> 00:18:47.704]  I said, this is the destiny of America that people 500 years ago in England and Germany and the Netherlands and France envisioned in their minds, this whole future.
[00:18:48.104 --> 00:18:50.945]  Hell, 200 years ago, they were envisioning biometrics computers.
[00:18:51.185 --> 00:18:55.206]  They drew the double helix before an electron microscope was invented, they knew it.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.

[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.840]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:44.903]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsStore.com

[00:22:47.164 --> 00:22:51.327]  I'm Alex Jones signing off from the Central Texas News Center in Austin.

[00:23:03.556 --> 00:23:06.418]  America is not going to just shrink away and not be strong.
[00:23:06.438 --> 00:23:07.819]  We're going to be stronger than ever.
[00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:10.781]  We've been used to empower the world government.
[00:23:10.941 --> 00:23:13.503]  A bunch of women in
[00:23:15.031 --> 00:23:22.105]  Little pink, purple, Color Revolution hat screaming, F you white male Alex Jones, go to hell, hope you die.
[00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:24.410]  And then saying, but we love you.
[00:23:26.226 --> 00:23:26.986]  Love Trump's hate.
[00:23:27.887 --> 00:23:31.088]  It's 50 partners of the Women's March on Washington, which is almost every group.
[00:23:31.388 --> 00:23:34.369]  The other major group is funded by the Islamic Jihad.
[00:23:34.389 --> 00:23:43.612]  And I saw all these women, including American, you know, I mean, American women, Hispanic, black, white, in hijab saying, this is how we empower women.
[00:23:44.052 --> 00:23:45.192]  You're bullying Muslims.
[00:23:45.232 --> 00:23:47.153]  We're going to put hoods on and go under Islam.
[00:23:48.533 --> 00:23:49.593]  Talk about being cuckold.
[00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:51.014]  Talk about Stockholm syndrome.
[00:23:52.267 --> 00:23:56.431]  Woman's March organizer recently met ex-Hamas operative, family has ties to terror group.
[00:23:56.651 --> 00:24:01.316]  Yeah, the leader of it is a woman that promotes, just like Abedin's mother did, genital mutilation.
[00:24:01.336 --> 00:24:03.298]  She's the leading person pushing it.
[00:24:04.844 --> 00:24:12.229]  And that's how women are empowered is wearing hoods, not being able to drive cars, being stoned to death if they go outside and don't follow their husband's orders.
[00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:13.730]  And the women go, that's a lie.
[00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.251]  Trump was funded by Saudi Arabia.
[00:24:15.911 --> 00:24:17.713]  Trump got zero money from Saudi Arabia.
[00:24:18.013 --> 00:24:19.334]  Zero money from Goldman Sachs.
[00:24:19.674 --> 00:24:20.955]  Zero money from the big globalists.
[00:24:20.975 --> 00:24:21.535]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:24:21.715 --> 00:24:23.677]  They should scream and spit at us and say he did.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.081]  I'm a woman, hear me roar.
[00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:28.042]  It's Gloria Steinem.
[00:24:28.082 --> 00:24:30.364]  Had a bunch of kids, but she says you shouldn't have a kid.
[00:24:30.764 --> 00:24:33.266]  She's proud of abortions, says that's how you prove your woman's killed your baby.
[00:24:33.746 --> 00:24:34.907]  I'm not attacking you if you had abortion.
[00:24:34.927 --> 00:24:36.188]  The point is she makes it a sacrament.
[00:24:36.728 --> 00:24:43.733]  And then she's admittedly CIA funded to break up the family, turn men into betas and make us easy to assimilate.
[00:24:44.113 --> 00:24:46.975]  And she admits that in a book she wrote and interviews.
[00:24:47.315 --> 00:24:49.657]  And there she is out there smiling with her victims.
[00:24:51.445 --> 00:24:53.306]  This is how you kill cultures and society.
[00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:54.627]  This isn't my opinion.
[00:24:54.847 --> 00:24:56.428]  This is declassified.
[00:24:57.309 --> 00:25:00.351]  I remember hearing Rush Limbaugh when I was a senior in high school, like 1992.
[00:25:02.891 --> 00:25:09.112]  Gloria Steinem in her new book admits that she was CIA and it was meant to break up the family and take control of things for social engineering.
[00:25:09.652 --> 00:25:17.094]  So I went home because I knew my mother had seen that book on the coffee table like a month before and I picked it up and flipped to where Rush had said and there it was.
[00:25:17.914 --> 00:25:25.496]  So I'd mentioned that many times over the years and I would get emails and the news would say, you can look this up, Jones claims the CIA ran the feminist movement.
[00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:26.856]  Yeah, they did stuff like
[00:25:28.123 --> 00:25:29.544]  Almost no women smoke cigarettes.
[00:25:30.144 --> 00:25:30.604]  There it is.
[00:25:30.624 --> 00:25:32.345]  The torches of freedom is what they called it.
[00:25:32.685 --> 00:25:34.125]  Your husband won't let you smoke cigarettes.
[00:25:34.506 --> 00:25:36.046]  The point is, smoke one if you want.
[00:25:36.086 --> 00:25:37.767]  They just said, be a woman, be cool.
[00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:38.827]  Torches of freedom.
[00:25:39.087 --> 00:25:40.088]  Because they targeted women.
[00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:41.528]  Hitler did as well.
[00:25:42.009 --> 00:25:49.412]  And then the next thing was, you know, Edward Bernays and all this other garbage about going after the family, breaking it up.
[00:25:49.892 --> 00:25:51.012]  And then Gloria Steinem and Ms.
[00:25:51.072 --> 00:25:54.734]  Magazine and the CIA and ugly art and break down the family.
[00:25:54.794 --> 00:25:55.294]  It's all there.
[00:25:55.854 --> 00:26:02.019]  Well, exactly when did your own association with the CIA start, and in what fashion?
[00:26:02.139 --> 00:26:04.401]  Did they come to you, or did you go to them?
[00:26:05.242 --> 00:26:21.475]  In 1958, when I came home from India, I discussed with student leaders, past and present, many of them active with the National Student Association, this kind of small foundation to encourage Americans to go.
[00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:23.517]  They thought it was a good idea, too.
[00:26:25.234 --> 00:26:38.662]  I was then told by foundations and professors and friends that I should not do this, that I would get in trouble with the House Un-American Activities Committee, the American Legion, all of those.
[00:26:38.682 --> 00:26:41.364]  Because they're still battling this.
[00:26:41.384 --> 00:26:42.184]  50s people.
[00:26:43.305 --> 00:26:45.346]  And I became convinced that it was impossible.
[00:26:46.127 --> 00:26:54.931]  It was at that point that the student leaders said to me that they had, in the past, received funds for international programs from the CIA.
[00:26:54.971 --> 00:27:03.195]  Yeah, I remember doing a big report about this and just cultural Marxism and where it really all started and it wasn't about empowering women to get them in the workforce.
[00:27:03.275 --> 00:27:08.717]  It was about creating new tax income, new slave workers, breaking up the family.
[00:27:08.797 --> 00:27:13.639]  I mean, this is a whole big plan that, as we can see, Gloria Steinem has been a part of it for decades.
[00:27:13.899 --> 00:27:15.180]  It's like we're in competition with men.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.982]  Men already are 40% of the college graduates.
[00:27:19.783 --> 00:27:20.883]  Don't worry, men are gone.
[00:27:20.923 --> 00:27:21.604]  There's no men left.
[00:27:21.624 --> 00:27:22.084]  It's all over.
[00:27:22.765 --> 00:27:24.986]  Who's going to speak up for them when they're obsolete?
[00:27:25.246 --> 00:27:26.847]  They say it's a brave new world, 1932.
[00:27:27.928 --> 00:27:31.230]  The plan is no gender, all test tubes.
[00:27:36.633 --> 00:27:39.175]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:27:39.235 --> 00:27:40.416]  That's not true.
[00:27:42.512 --> 00:27:43.493]  That's impossible!
[00:27:44.034 --> 00:27:46.976]  Search your feelings, you know it to be true.
[00:27:46.996 --> 00:27:47.677]  Disgusting!
[00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:12.376]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:28:12.736 --> 00:28:14.598]  We are here in Washington, D.C.
[00:28:14.718 --> 00:28:15.899]  right near the U.S.
[00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:17.061]  Capitol building.
[00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:21.885]  And as you can see, there's a large women's rights protest.
[00:28:22.146 --> 00:28:23.647]  Let's go see what they have to say.
[00:28:24.788 --> 00:28:26.190]  Ma'am, what brings you out here today?
[00:28:26.951 --> 00:28:31.515]  Just to protect my rights and bring everyone together and be happy and love.
[00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:32.657]  Love trumps hate.
[00:28:33.866 --> 00:28:34.407]  Okay.
[00:28:34.907 --> 00:28:37.809]  So you don't feel like Donald Trump's gonna do anything for your rights?
[00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.650]  Hell no.
[00:28:39.211 --> 00:28:39.731]  He's not.
[00:28:39.791 --> 00:28:40.932]  I mean, just his statements.
[00:28:41.353 --> 00:28:42.534]  I don't want him to grab my pussy.
[00:28:43.715 --> 00:28:51.281]  One thing that's kind of interesting to notice is that a lot of these protesters here all seem to be wearing these hats.
[00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:53.143]  These pink hats with cat ears.
[00:28:53.163 --> 00:29:01.150]  So I don't know if this is like a new thing, like how the communists have their berets, but I'm noticing that all these feminists tend to have cat-eared hats.
[00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.311]  So what do the hats actually mean?
[00:29:03.331 --> 00:29:04.211]  Like, what are they called?
[00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:05.651]  Pussy hats.
[00:29:07.792 --> 00:29:09.753]  So these are the pussy hats then, right?
[00:29:09.953 --> 00:29:11.394]  Yes, that's what these are.
[00:29:12.554 --> 00:29:15.075]  Hi mom, I'm talking about pussy on the camera.
[00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.331]  You are allowed to be out here.
[00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:21.852]  All voices should be heard.
[00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:26.196]  I'm just disappointed in what the results of fake news have done to the country.
[00:29:26.336 --> 00:29:28.737]  So you're really disappointed in, like, CNN, right?
[00:29:28.838 --> 00:29:31.479]  Because they've been caught lying many, many times.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.901]  You'd have to tell me what the facts are about that.
[00:29:33.921 --> 00:29:35.843]  I know what the evidence is that CNN has lied.
[00:29:36.443 --> 00:29:36.743]  Really?
[00:29:37.044 --> 00:29:44.049]  You don't think that this whole Golden Peagate story they got called out for promoting was not being caught as a lie?
[00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:45.390]  No, that was a real issue.
[00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:46.551]  No, that was a lie.
[00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:47.792]  You're talking about fake news.
[00:29:47.812 --> 00:29:49.193]  I want to hear about women's health.
[00:29:49.593 --> 00:29:51.755]  I want to hear about equality for everybody.
[00:29:52.095 --> 00:29:53.076]  I don't want to hear about pee.
[00:29:53.616 --> 00:29:59.340]  She asked me a question, and when I answered it, you want to change the subject.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.821]  I don't consider that news.
[00:30:01.021 --> 00:30:04.464]  So if you want to talk about a real issue, give me a real issue.
[00:30:04.504 --> 00:30:06.365]  CNN was talking about this.
[00:30:06.545 --> 00:30:08.606]  We were not promoting this.
[00:30:08.867 --> 00:30:13.730]  I would like to talk about real news, real equality, real information.
[00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.272]  A lot of people are out here against Trump.
[00:30:17.172 --> 00:30:24.795]  Because he wants to defund Planned Parenthood, which I worked at to get birth control for many, many women.
[00:30:25.595 --> 00:30:27.175]  Would you support funding Planned Parenthood?
[00:30:28.016 --> 00:30:31.297]  Yeah, if it didn't have to do with abortions, they do some very good work.
[00:30:31.317 --> 00:30:35.978]  Cervical cancer, lots of women's issues, women's health issues are taken care of.
[00:30:36.038 --> 00:30:41.000]  I know one of the candidates, I won't mention names, said, we're not going to spend that kind of money on women's health issues.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.460]  I am.
[00:30:42.185 --> 00:30:46.248]  What about him trying to get paid maternity leave for women?
[00:30:46.668 --> 00:30:51.531]  What about the fact that he's trying to make it so women can write off their child care expenses?
[00:30:51.631 --> 00:30:52.651]  We will support him.
[00:30:53.172 --> 00:30:54.372]  Proudly and loudly.
[00:30:55.593 --> 00:30:56.494]  Michael Moore.
[00:30:58.733 --> 00:31:02.314]  We'd like to protest Donald Trump because we believe he's not fit to be president.
[00:31:02.334 --> 00:31:04.375]  Why do you think he's not fit?
[00:31:05.135 --> 00:31:07.696]  He does not have control of anything.
[00:31:07.756 --> 00:31:08.836]  His cabinet is a mess.
[00:31:08.916 --> 00:31:10.517]  Nobody there has any intelligence.
[00:31:10.837 --> 00:31:11.877]  No one knows what they're doing.
[00:31:11.897 --> 00:31:13.778]  They're just rich and they bought their way into power.
[00:31:13.818 --> 00:31:20.200]  When women make up half of the population of the country and someone who does not respect women expects to rule the country, how is that going to work?
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.381]  I mean, if you cannot respect the people that you're trying to manage, it's never going to work well.
[00:31:24.961 --> 00:31:29.102]  The president is supposed to represent the people, and he does not represent the majority of the people.
[00:31:29.122 --> 00:31:29.782]  Yeah, the majority.
[00:31:30.903 --> 00:31:45.766]  So, how do you think he doesn't respect women when, you know, he seems to be pretty respectful with his daughter, and, you know, wouldn't you say maybe his daughter and his wife and all these women that surround him wouldn't want to have anything to do with him if he was disrespectful to them?
[00:31:45.786 --> 00:31:49.347]  Well, I mean, he does grab pussies, so, like, I'm not really into that.
[00:31:49.947 --> 00:31:52.388]  Why did you vote for a racist?
[00:31:53.448 --> 00:31:56.070]  He's an idiot that makes fun of disabled people.
[00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.750]  Sorry!
[00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.452]  He doesn't make fun of disabled people!
[00:32:03.574 --> 00:32:04.574]  What brings you out here today?
[00:32:04.594 --> 00:32:05.775]  The Women's March, honey.
[00:32:05.895 --> 00:32:07.316]  Equality, inclusivity.
[00:32:07.856 --> 00:32:09.417]  What brings you here is the real question.
[00:32:10.098 --> 00:32:14.040]  Just covering the news, working as a female reporter in the field.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.841]  Yes, well, I get it.
[00:32:16.341 --> 00:32:19.183]  So, um, do you think, what do you think about Donald Trump?
[00:32:19.263 --> 00:32:21.184]  Is this why you're, part of the reason you're out here today?
[00:32:21.823 --> 00:32:30.790]  I think that Donald Trump may be a factor of the reason, but I think the main reason is just the awareness of inclusivity and equality.
[00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:42.839]  I'm here with the Back to Work Collective, and we're a theatre group that's really focusing on how to deal with situations, and people may be feeling left out, and privilege and oppression, and how to kind of talk through that and work through that.
[00:32:43.522 --> 00:32:49.065]  So these women's rights protesters are completely trampling all over somebody's garden.
[00:32:49.085 --> 00:32:51.026]  Uh, excuse me!
[00:32:51.046 --> 00:32:55.208]  I'm a woman here and do I have a right to work?
[00:32:56.769 --> 00:32:58.710]  Are you against my right?
[00:33:02.172 --> 00:33:03.452]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:33:03.492 --> 00:33:07.935]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:07.150]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.

[00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:17.614]  This is Ashley Beckford reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:37:18.095 --> 00:37:20.437]  I'm here in the heart of Harlem.
[00:37:20.457 --> 00:37:21.879]  It's Martin Luther King Day.
[00:37:21.979 --> 00:37:24.161]  Do you think that he would support Black Lives Matter?
[00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:26.063]  Absolutely.
[00:37:26.784 --> 00:37:27.345]  Absolutely.
[00:37:27.365 --> 00:37:27.345]  100%.
[00:37:27.385 --> 00:37:28.926]  You think he would 100% support them?
[00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:28.926]  100%.
[00:37:28.966 --> 00:37:29.066]  Okay.
[00:37:29.086 --> 00:37:29.407]  Most definitely.
[00:37:36.823 --> 00:37:38.765]  I think he would obviously be against that.
[00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:47.214]  He was about, you know, peace and not violence and working with, you know, the police instead of, like, against them.
[00:37:47.234 --> 00:37:54.942]  He might like the whole idea of it until he really understands how people's going about expressing it to the world.
[00:37:55.262 --> 00:37:59.365]  Oink, oink, bang, bang, you know, pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.
[00:37:59.665 --> 00:38:02.627]  These are some of the slogans that Black Lives Matter says.
[00:38:02.848 --> 00:38:03.988]  Oink, oink, bang, bang!
[00:38:04.128 --> 00:38:05.269]  Oink, oink, bang, bang!
[00:38:05.429 --> 00:38:06.590]  Oink, oink, bang, bang!
[00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:07.831]  Oink, oink, bang, bang!
[00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:08.892]  Oink, oink, bang, bang!
[00:38:08.932 --> 00:38:10.493]  We rock the bench to take freedom again!
[00:38:10.693 --> 00:38:12.955]  We rock the bench to take freedom again!
[00:38:13.115 --> 00:38:14.736]  And we need it to our last breath!
[00:38:14.976 --> 00:38:16.617]  And we need it to our last breath!
[00:38:16.718 --> 00:38:17.998]  Too black, too strong!
[00:38:18.058 --> 00:38:19.259]  Too black, too strong!
[00:38:19.279 --> 00:38:20.380]  Too black, too strong!
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.401]  Too black, too strong!
[00:38:42.203 --> 00:38:43.765]  20 more pigs and we'll be through!
[00:38:43.785 --> 00:38:45.987]  20 more pigs and we'll be through!
[00:38:48.029 --> 00:38:50.070]  A pig is a pig, that's what I said!
[00:38:52.212 --> 00:38:55.095]  No, he's a pig, he's a pig, that's what I said!
[00:38:56.396 --> 00:38:58.418]  A pig is a pig, that's what I said!
[00:38:58.438 --> 00:39:00.540]  I ain't gonna pay pay!
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.522]  I ain't gonna pay pay!
[00:39:08.752 --> 00:39:09.432]  Black Power!
[00:39:09.472 --> 00:39:10.033]  Black Power!
[00:39:10.073 --> 00:39:10.733]  Black Power!
[00:39:10.773 --> 00:39:11.334]  Black Power!
[00:39:19.892 --> 00:39:23.335]  Do you think that Martin Luther King would approve of that with his non-violence?
[00:39:23.755 --> 00:39:23.935]  No.
[00:39:24.356 --> 00:39:24.916]  Not at all.
[00:39:24.956 --> 00:39:27.198]  I don't think he would have supported that part.
[00:39:27.458 --> 00:39:27.759]  Right.
[00:39:28.119 --> 00:39:31.702]  But just the idea of Black Lives Matter.
[00:39:31.942 --> 00:39:32.182]  Yeah.
[00:39:32.422 --> 00:39:32.683]  Right.
[00:39:32.823 --> 00:39:36.326]  I think he would be more All Lives Matter, but I understand.
[00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:36.986]  Right.
[00:39:37.146 --> 00:39:37.446]  Right.
[00:39:37.567 --> 00:39:38.487]  All Lives Matter.
[00:39:38.547 --> 00:39:44.632]  I think he would have said what a lot of people agree with, which is that all lives matter.
[00:39:45.822 --> 00:40:02.671]  Although the Black Lives Matter movement is more about the amount of like police brutality going on against minorities, which I understand, but the name Black Lives Matter is kind of like triggers a lot of negativity for the movement, which is, you know, positive.
[00:40:02.851 --> 00:40:08.393]  I mean, as far as Dr. Martin Luther King, when we look at it, he feel like all lives matter in that point.
[00:40:08.454 --> 00:40:12.516]  But I mean, as far as supporting it, I don't think he would be
[00:40:13.916 --> 00:40:21.378]  Against it, sort of, but he would encourage the black community to not just encourage black lives.
[00:40:23.718 --> 00:40:26.258]  This is the Adam Clayton Powell statue.
[00:40:26.719 --> 00:40:37.901]  It says, press forward at all times climbing toward that higher ground of the harmonious society that shapes the laws of man to the laws of God.
[00:40:38.121 --> 00:40:39.241]  Adam Clayton Powell Jr.
[00:40:53.507 --> 00:40:57.269]  I think he would have found some sort of medium between the police and the black communities.
[00:40:57.509 --> 00:40:57.689]  Yeah.
[00:41:17.782 --> 00:41:19.444]  And that's exactly what I think we need.
[00:41:19.504 --> 00:41:20.486]  I totally agree with you.
[00:41:20.866 --> 00:41:21.507]  Absolutely.
[00:41:21.767 --> 00:41:23.810]  They're not all bad people.
[00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:29.738]  It's just, you know, a few that spoil the whole image of all of them being, you know, like, corrupt.
[00:41:30.018 --> 00:41:30.619]  But they're not.
[00:41:31.039 --> 00:41:34.404]  So, we all kind of have to work together to solve the issue.
[00:41:35.064 --> 00:41:38.426]  Like, we're not going to fix it by ourselves and they're not going to fix it by themselves.
[00:41:38.446 --> 00:41:41.568]  So obviously, we need to have some kind of middle ground.
[00:41:41.608 --> 00:41:43.289]  My sister's a cop in D.C.
[00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.849]  Oh, really?
[00:41:43.889 --> 00:41:44.790]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:49.473]  My family, I have family members who are police officers and I do appreciate what they do.
[00:41:49.513 --> 00:41:56.337]  I know there's some people out there, but it's a very small minority, you know, who are out to do harm, you know, to people.
[00:41:56.397 --> 00:42:02.961]  If it's not trying to single out to say black lives are more important, it's just saying that right now,
[00:42:03.661 --> 00:42:07.266]  You know it's they're kind of being targeted by by the police.
[00:42:07.867 --> 00:42:08.748]  Right.
[00:42:08.768 --> 00:42:19.382]  So I think he would like support it but at the same time I think he would have like some kind of issue with like maybe like the name or the idea that it might be trying to say that
[00:42:19.902 --> 00:42:22.143]  One life is more important than the other, which it is not.
[00:42:22.704 --> 00:42:28.147]  I mean, the whole idea of a Black Lives Matter, when you hear that slogan, I think it's going to be appealing to him.
[00:42:28.167 --> 00:42:33.630]  But to see the action and what people is doing as far as Black Lives Matter, I don't think he'll be OK with it.
[00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:35.571]  I have a dream.
[00:42:39.153 --> 00:42:40.994]  My four little children.
[00:42:42.745 --> 00:42:49.510]  We'll one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
[00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.291]  I have a dream today!
[00:42:52.592 --> 00:43:06.241]  Let freedom ring, and when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city,
[00:43:07.452 --> 00:43:22.768]  We will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, Free at last!
[00:43:23.169 --> 00:43:24.030]  Free at last!
[00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.873]  Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
[00:43:33.325 --> 00:43:40.029]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:43:40.289 --> 00:43:42.030]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:43:55.717 --> 00:44:00.941]  The big message on the mainstream news media right now is he is the most unpopular president in history.
[00:44:01.141 --> 00:44:02.762]  Which, according to what polls?
[00:44:03.322 --> 00:44:03.843]  Exactly.
[00:44:03.923 --> 00:44:06.364]  Just like the polls that said Hillary was going to win, right?
[00:44:06.404 --> 00:44:07.385]  The day of the election.
[00:44:07.405 --> 00:44:08.646]  80% chance, right?
[00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:09.506]  Correct.
[00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:15.510]  During a speech today, Donald Trump said, when America is united, America is unstoppable.
[00:44:15.851 --> 00:44:18.953]  The mainstream media is trying to tell us that we are divided.
[00:44:19.053 --> 00:44:22.095]  Like, we're more divided now than since the Civil War.
[00:44:22.415 --> 00:44:25.137]  There's going to be another civil war waiting around every corner, you know.
[00:44:25.337 --> 00:44:26.438]  We're about to go into civil war.
[00:44:26.999 --> 00:44:27.599]  I don't buy it.
[00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:29.981]  I think we are united now more than ever.
[00:44:30.001 --> 00:44:32.543]  I think patriotism is making a huge comeback.
[00:44:33.263 --> 00:44:36.966]  And I think that everyone is very, extremely optimistic about the future.
[00:44:37.226 --> 00:44:38.467]  Apart from the left, of course.
[00:44:38.507 --> 00:44:40.829]  They're always butt hurt and they're always going to have problems.
[00:44:40.909 --> 00:44:43.611]  But I'm very optimistic about the future.
[00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:46.934]  This is a historic moment and I can't wait to see what's next.
[00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:47.794]  No kidding.
[00:44:47.834 --> 00:44:48.795]  Well, you mentioned the left.
[00:44:48.815 --> 00:44:56.700]  You know, I'm of the belief that the cycle of the lies, I mean, we've seen a dissipation happen in the atmosphere where we were able to break through some of those.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.001]  And we, our focus should be now to pull those people over.
[00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:01.722]  But this is, they're doing it for us.
[00:45:01.762 --> 00:45:10.347]  The more they act like fools, the more they protest, burn down their own cities, the more 60 plus Democrats refuse to go to this peaceful transfer of power.
[00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:13.989]  And then they sit out and they boycott Trump's inauguration.
[00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:15.130]  That just helps us.
[00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.051]  That's a turnoff to a lot of people.
[00:45:17.091 --> 00:45:18.172]  They think they look silly.
[00:45:18.552 --> 00:45:19.772]  They're unpatriotic.
[00:45:20.553 --> 00:45:21.994]  And it's really disrespectful.
[00:45:22.354 --> 00:45:24.895]  And what it's doing, it's getting recruits on our side.
[00:45:24.995 --> 00:45:26.136]  That's what they're doing in the process.
[00:45:26.336 --> 00:45:30.278]  That's how they lost the election to begin with, and they haven't learned from their mistakes.
[00:45:30.878 --> 00:45:35.042]  You're talking about also, I wanted to mention this one lady's tweet about the black community.
[00:45:35.122 --> 00:45:45.230]  She was an Iraq war veteran and she was talking about Barack Obama and Congressman Lewis because, you know, we've seen a lot from Congressman Lewis boycotting the inauguration.
[00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.994]  And she said, look, you know, President Obama and Congressman Lewis, they've been in power a very long time.
[00:45:51.114 --> 00:45:53.496]  What have they done for the black communities of America?
[00:45:53.516 --> 00:45:55.818]  They've remained poor and crime ridden.
[00:45:56.318 --> 00:45:58.080]  And a lot of destruction and hopelessness.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:01.363]  Well, these two men have gotten wealthier and wealthier and wealthier.
[00:46:01.383 --> 00:46:02.845]  It's just empty rhetoric.
[00:46:03.265 --> 00:46:10.693]  John Lewis's district is a total disaster, just like every other Democratic-controlled district and congressional districts across the country.
[00:46:11.213 --> 00:46:12.174]  Total disasters.
[00:46:12.314 --> 00:46:14.596]  They're inner-city ghetto zones.
[00:46:14.657 --> 00:46:15.517]  They're crime-ridden.
[00:46:15.758 --> 00:46:16.659]  Highest crime rates.
[00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:18.420]  The strictest gun control laws.
[00:46:19.301 --> 00:46:24.727]  And the black ownership of homes and businesses are rock bottom, so it's a complete disaster.
[00:46:25.168 --> 00:46:30.534]  And then he says that he is boycotting the inauguration, John Lewis, right?
[00:46:30.914 --> 00:46:32.216]  On behalf of black people.
[00:46:32.516 --> 00:46:34.038]  He doesn't speak for all black people.
[00:46:34.058 --> 00:46:34.599]  No, he does not.
[00:46:34.619 --> 00:46:36.541]  He boycotted his paycheck all those years.
[00:46:36.821 --> 00:46:44.384]  Yeah, I mean, you know, he doesn't speak for the black people that in my life, my friends and family or the people that I've met on the street who've said they were voting for Trump.
[00:46:44.424 --> 00:46:45.844]  He doesn't speak for all black people.
[00:46:46.084 --> 00:46:52.426]  Imagine 60 plus Republicans boycotting Obama's inauguration.
[00:46:53.126 --> 00:46:54.267]  I mean, it would be the end of the world.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:48:59.626 --> 00:49:02.287]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:11.224]  Well, we're going to take a minute to explore the absolute lunacy that we are dealing with.
[00:49:11.324 --> 00:49:30.057]  We have many people who are part of this so-called resist movement who truly want to say that those on the right or people who voted for Donald Trump are racist, sexist, homophobic, misogynist, violent, whatever kind of term that you can come up with when they themselves are absolutely the violent ones.
[00:49:30.157 --> 00:49:31.058]  They're classless.
[00:49:31.278 --> 00:49:33.780]  They're taking tax that, you know, for instance,
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:42.369]  They're attacking Barron Trump, which it's always kind of been an unspoken rule that the kids in politics are off limits because they didn't ask to be put in that position.
[00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:45.452]  So this is just one example of what we're dealing with here.
[00:49:45.492 --> 00:49:50.018]  We've got an SNL writer, Katie Rich, allegedly tweeting.
[00:49:50.318 --> 00:49:54.382]  I mean, we say allegedly because she deleted her Twitter account, so it's not up there.
[00:49:55.083 --> 00:50:00.866]  She tweeted out a joke about Barron Trump on the day of his father's inauguration.
[00:50:00.946 --> 00:50:01.306]  Here it is.
[00:50:01.366 --> 00:50:02.147]  It's so hilarious.
[00:50:02.447 --> 00:50:06.409]  She says, Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter.
[00:50:06.929 --> 00:50:08.450]  Oh, hilarious.
[00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:14.773]  So there she went on to delete her account, maybe even her entire social media presence from what we can tell.
[00:50:15.313 --> 00:50:20.156]  And also another thing, Rich's name wasn't on the credits last night.
[00:50:20.996 --> 00:50:21.357]  I don't know.
[00:50:37.356 --> 00:50:46.299]  Women that were really empowered after this women's march going on, leaving the march, thinking that they can attack people and get them kicked off airplanes, like they rule the world now.
[00:50:46.659 --> 00:50:53.962]  And also too, that you can just tweet totally tasteless jokes and think there isn't going to be any repercussions with your employer.
[00:50:54.022 --> 00:50:58.584]  So many people even calling for assassination of President Trump.
[00:50:58.944 --> 00:50:59.524]  Things like that.
[00:51:00.064 --> 00:51:00.804]  You just can't do that.
[00:51:00.864 --> 00:51:04.886]  Even Madonna, who thinks that she runs the world, she's even getting looked at.
[00:51:05.806 --> 00:51:10.049]  By the Secret Service for what she said about blowing up the White House.
[00:51:10.669 --> 00:51:17.193]  But here's another Comedy Central writer who's calling 10-year-old Barron Trump a date rapist to be.
[00:51:18.014 --> 00:51:19.655]  This is Steven Spinola.
[00:51:20.395 --> 00:51:21.856]  He's a writer for Comedy Central.
[00:51:21.916 --> 00:51:24.158]  So here's another guy who just, you know, oh that's...
[00:51:24.958 --> 00:51:26.680]  So hilarious.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:31.646]  Barron Trump's going to be a very handsome date rapist because rape jokes are always funny, right?
[00:51:31.706 --> 00:51:36.792]  I mean, here's the left always talking about rape culture and how they're... But it's okay for them to do it.
[00:51:36.832 --> 00:51:39.095]  It's okay for them to be racist and inappropriate.
[00:51:39.475 --> 00:51:44.641]  It's just not okay for anyone else because they're not racist because they have black friends, I think.
[00:51:45.365 --> 00:51:49.809]  But we also have, you know, protesters linking up with ISIS.
[00:51:49.909 --> 00:51:50.750]  Imagine that.
[00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.952]  So there are actually photos up.
[00:51:53.012 --> 00:51:54.593]  Paul Joseph Watson has the article.
[00:51:55.073 --> 00:52:02.300]  So this is an anti-Trump protester and he's going trying to intimidate Trump supporters who are inside of this bar in Washington, D.C.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.524]  And he goes up to the window and he's displaying an ISIS flag on his phone.
[00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:11.507]  Now, let's all recall that when when we're hearing about
[00:52:12.268 --> 00:52:19.192]  The police going and doing these raids in Belgium and other countries, and they're raiding these jihadist homes.
[00:52:19.212 --> 00:52:25.855]  The first thing they see is they go to their cell phone, they have ISIS flags on their phone, they have ISIS beheading videos on their phone.
[00:52:26.175 --> 00:52:32.138]  So here we have this little Antifa jerk-off, and that's exactly what he's got on his phone.
[00:52:32.458 --> 00:52:33.819]  So he's standing there at the window,
[00:52:34.279 --> 00:52:34.679]  We're good.
[00:52:52.807 --> 00:52:54.328]  Who knows if anything happened to this guy.
[00:52:54.628 --> 00:53:01.633]  He then comes back and shows a video of an ISIS beheading on his phone as if to taunt the people who are inside the bar.
[00:53:01.673 --> 00:53:06.115]  I'm surprised those people inside the bar didn't get out and beat this kid's butt.
[00:53:07.276 --> 00:53:21.845]  But this is, you know, this is really interesting because we reported on the fact that in December 2015, ISIS has actually written in its own manifesto of how it plans to recruit members of these far left groups since both groups
[00:53:22.225 --> 00:53:23.826]  Share broadly the same goals.
[00:53:24.066 --> 00:53:25.927]  Just like the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[00:53:25.947 --> 00:53:29.508]  That's why we have ISIS linking up with the drug cartels in Mexico.
[00:53:30.629 --> 00:53:33.850]  So this was from the December 2015 manifesto.
[00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:47.576]  It's a section called European Muslims Allying with Left-Wing Activists and it states that jihadists and left-wingers will start to work together in small cells of groups to fight and sabotage against the financial elites.
[00:53:48.197 --> 00:53:50.478]  So it goes on to point out
[00:53:51.258 --> 00:54:00.247]  Many of these people, who are sometimes part of anonymous and anarchy movements, will ally with Muslims to fight against the neo-Nazis and rich politicians.
[00:54:00.287 --> 00:54:07.353]  They will give intelligence, share weapons, and do undercover work for the Muslims to pave the way for the conquest of Rome.
[00:54:07.814 --> 00:54:08.675]  How will this happen?
[00:54:09.355 --> 00:54:16.358]  If you've ever been in a pro-Palestine, anti-Israel protest, you will see many activists who are not even Muslims who are supportive of what Muslims are calling for.
[00:54:16.378 --> 00:54:18.179]  The fall of Zionism.
[00:54:18.499 --> 00:54:22.921]  It is most likely here that connections between Muslims and left-wing activists will be made.
[00:54:23.441 --> 00:54:29.224]  A portion from them will realize that protests are not effective and that armed combat is the alternative.
[00:54:29.504 --> 00:54:35.747]  So they will start to work together in small cells of groups to fight and sabotage against the financial elite.
[00:54:36.127 --> 00:54:42.271]  So it appears as if, you know, some members of the Antifa, the anarchist communist group that was out there in D.C.
[00:54:42.331 --> 00:54:43.011]  causing mayhem.
[00:54:43.451 --> 00:54:46.133]  Sounds like they are already open to that possibility.
[00:54:46.673 --> 00:54:48.835]  So, you know, this is what we're dealing with here.
[00:54:48.895 --> 00:54:49.975]  People, open your eyes.
[00:54:50.455 --> 00:54:52.577]  You never Trumpers and you resistors.
[00:54:52.837 --> 00:54:54.098]  This is who you're linking up with.
[00:54:54.878 --> 00:55:12.757]  In fact, one of the organizers behind the Women's March, who would not allow conservative pro-life women to officially take part in these Women's Marches, Ashley Beckford, as you saw earlier in the show, she was actually attacked for being a black woman in a Make America Great Again hat.
[00:55:13.417 --> 00:55:14.759]  She's not allowed to have an opinion.
[00:55:14.839 --> 00:55:19.063]  Her opinion as a black minority woman, Trump supporter, doesn't matter.
[00:55:19.463 --> 00:55:30.714]  But the leader, one of the organizers behind this group, is a woman, a Muslim woman, Linda Sarsour, who's actually campaigning and calling for Sharia law to be allowed in the United States.
[00:55:31.055 --> 00:55:36.921]  She says it's a shame that the United States doesn't allow them to practice their religion and have Sharia law in their communities.
[00:55:37.541 --> 00:55:40.984]  But she also recently met with an ex-Hamas operative.
[00:55:41.245 --> 00:55:47.110]  He's an alleged operative, but she's out there taking a picture with Salah Sarsour.
[00:55:48.451 --> 00:55:50.773]  She says that they're not related.
[00:55:51.474 --> 00:55:58.960]  But this is a guy who was jailed in Israel in the 1990s because of his alleged work for the terrorist group Hamas.
[00:55:59.941 --> 00:56:13.031]  Um, and, you know, pictures with other people, but this is, this is one of the organizers behind the group where women are like going and putting hijabs on in the women's march, which is like a symbol of oppression and of subservience.
[00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:20.417]  I mean, by, by, by its nature, if you're practicing Sharia, then you agree that women are a lower class.
[00:56:20.557 --> 00:56:20.977]  Okay.
[00:56:21.057 --> 00:56:24.660]  Regardless of what they want to tell you, no, it just, you're covering yourself and it's,
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:28.162]  You know, because you want to be modest and everything.
[00:56:28.222 --> 00:56:29.183]  Sure, that's a part of it.
[00:56:29.223 --> 00:56:31.505]  But on the other hand, it's also very subservient.
[00:56:31.545 --> 00:56:36.528]  It's not about the ladies out there who are topless and that's the massive amount of freedom you have.
[00:56:36.588 --> 00:56:39.130]  It's totally Wally World, completely backwards.
[00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:46.175]  And now you have these little jihadist Antifa kids setting fire and busting into businesses.
[00:56:46.835 --> 00:56:52.219]  We've also got video of an anti-Trump protester setting a Trump supporter's hair on fire.
[00:56:52.439 --> 00:56:53.340]  Take a look at this video.
[00:57:02.716 --> 00:57:02.816]  Whoa!
[00:57:09.827 --> 00:57:13.670]  So to these peaceful protesters, this is what democracy looks like.
[00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:22.517]  Targeting people, being a bigot, setting their hair on fire, and ironically, you know, right before they did this, they were all chanting, love trumps hate.
[00:57:22.797 --> 00:57:23.918]  So this is what I'm talking about.
[00:57:23.958 --> 00:57:24.999]  These people are mental.
[00:57:25.239 --> 00:57:28.642]  They're saying, love trumps hate, so now we're going to beat your ass.
[00:57:28.942 --> 00:57:31.424]  We are completely insane and we're letting you know that.
[00:57:32.805 --> 00:57:39.012]  Maybe there's a little bit of saving grace here because, like I mentioned, we have these people leaving their march thinking that they run the world now.
[00:57:39.653 --> 00:57:44.018]  We have this video of an elderly woman demanding a Trump supporter move seats.
[00:57:44.058 --> 00:57:46.581]  He's not allowed to touch the armrest.
[00:57:47.102 --> 00:57:48.323]  He's so disgusting to her.
[00:57:48.724 --> 00:57:51.026]  And look, she gets kicked off the plane.
[00:57:51.827 --> 00:57:56.911]  You pretend you have the moral high ground, but you put that man's finger on the knee of your butt.
[00:57:56.971 --> 00:57:59.813]  That man doesn't believe in climate change.
[00:57:59.853 --> 00:58:01.034]  Do you believe in gravity?
[00:58:01.054 --> 00:58:02.595]  Did you know gravity is just a theory?
[00:58:02.695 --> 00:58:03.696]  I can't teach you greatness.
[00:58:03.736 --> 00:58:04.757]  I've been in it for 20 years.
[00:58:07.499 --> 00:58:08.880]  May I have a way for you?
[00:58:10.061 --> 00:58:11.362]  I'm American, but you're a citizen.
[00:58:11.422 --> 00:58:12.703]  You're not welcome.
[00:58:20.812 --> 00:58:21.832]  So guess what, girl?
[00:58:21.952 --> 00:58:23.192]  You don't run the world.
[00:58:23.252 --> 00:58:29.974]  You don't just get to walk out and start belittling men just because they're men or just because they're Donald Trump supporters.
[00:58:30.374 --> 00:58:37.116]  Now, one of a really great street artists, Sabo, met these anti-Trump agitators with his posters.
[00:58:37.196 --> 00:58:38.276]  They're totally awesome.
[00:58:39.376 --> 00:58:42.137]  Trump giving the two middle fingers salute.
[00:58:42.697 --> 00:58:50.667]  And the tagline, no one takes this protest seriously because every 20 minutes for eight years Obama dropped a bomb and you said nothing.
[00:58:51.327 --> 00:58:51.848]  Boom!
[00:58:52.268 --> 00:58:53.890]  Well that's gonna do it for the show tonight.
[00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:57.314]  Thank you all for tuning in and we'll see here again tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[00:58:57.374 --> 00:58:57.695]  Central.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
