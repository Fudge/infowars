[00:00:24.693 --> 00:00:26.195]  We are on the march.
[00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:28.959]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.583]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:44.029]  We are live with this Thursday, January 5th edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.250]  I am Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.511]  We've got two big guests coming up in the second and third hours.
[00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:58.475]  Firstly, Tommy Robinson, who's had a public Twitter spat with the singer Lily Allen over the migrant crisis here in Britain, making headlines.
[00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.576]  We're going to get his response to that.
[00:01:01.057 --> 00:01:06.079]  Basically, she's threatening legal action because she lost an argument to him on Twitter.
[00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.584]  So we're going to get Tommy's take on that, along with a bunch of other news stories.
[00:01:11.144 --> 00:01:20.996]  Then after that, we've got Lauren Southern coming on to talk about both her new book and our top story, which, of course, you've probably seen the video everywhere by now.
[00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:26.722]  Absolutely shocking footage, which came out last night, in fact, just after we got off air.
[00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:48.079]  Of an 18 year old mentally disabled young man kidnapped in Chicago by a group of four black teens, again teens but adults, kidnapped, beaten, brutalized, humiliated throughout this 30-40 minute video clip and bearing in mind he was kidnapped for up to 48 hours.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.242]  Up to two days before they released him.
[00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.185]  Constant racial slurs.
[00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:56.707]  F white people.
[00:01:57.288 --> 00:01:58.129]  F Donald Trump.
[00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:01.052]  Forcing him to say, quote, I love black people.
[00:02:01.692 --> 00:02:12.524]  Blatantly egregious, hateful, racist assault that went on for up to two days on a mentally disabled man in West Chicago.
[00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:14.981]  And how did the media react?
[00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:16.382]  How did the left react?
[00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:20.826]  Well, of course they reacted by saying, there's no evidence this is a hate crime.
[00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:24.129]  Completely expected that you would get this reaction.
[00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.791]  In fact, many of them have failed to even condemn it.
[00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:33.457]  You see there the article, CNN Panelist Blames Trump for Racist Torture of Mentally Disabled Man.
[00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:36.340]  And of course that wasn't entirely predictable as well.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:52.213]  No, it's not the fact that they've made anti-white racism cute, they've made it trendy, they've entrenched it so deeply in popular culture that it's now a regular MTV BuzzFeed meme to come out with these ridiculous anti-white people videos on a routine basis.
[00:02:52.713 --> 00:03:02.882]  It's not the fact that you've had two years plus of the media legitimising Black Lives Matter and it's clear racist rhetoric against white people, it's call for white cops to be killed
[00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:16.130]  Which has been acted on by actual snipers, who have then said that they were radicalised by Black Lives Matter, of course at every single step of the way, the media upholding, legitimising the narrative.
[00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:24.496]  It's not about anti-Trump supporters going out and attacking Trump supporters at his rallies, almost every single time.
[00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:33.262]  It's not about during the riots where people, white people, would be deliberately targeted for their skin colour by BLM supporters.
[00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:33.814]  We're good.
[00:03:34.224 --> 00:03:36.025]  In Charlotte, in other areas.
[00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:37.606]  No, it's nothing to do with that.
[00:03:38.227 --> 00:03:45.992]  It's because of Donald Trump's rhetoric that this 18-year-old mentally disabled white kid got abducted, got beaten.
[00:03:46.352 --> 00:03:47.893]  They actually scalped him.
[00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:51.396]  Some people even say you can see the white of his skull.
[00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.937]  They scalped him, they cut his hair off.
[00:03:53.977 --> 00:03:55.818]  Again, total humiliation.
[00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:03.484]  This is basically someone with the mental age of a child being tortured, beaten, abused, assaulted.
[00:04:04.364 --> 00:04:09.506]  Again, racial slurs launched over and over again for almost two days solid.
[00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:15.608]  And Chicago police have actually come out and said, Oh, we don't know if this is a hate crime.
[00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:16.829]  We're still investigating.
[00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.949]  Probably isn't.
[00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.050]  Probably just stupid kids messing about.
[00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:22.151]  They actually said that.
[00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.872]  Stupid kids messing about.
[00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:29.434]  Now, if this case was in isolation, then maybe, and we're going to get to these clips after the break.
[00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:32.375]  If it was in isolation, then maybe.
[00:04:33.578 --> 00:04:36.281]  But we've seen a string of anti-Trump hate crimes.
[00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:44.990]  We played the clip again out of Chicago a few months ago, where the guy is literally dragged, beaten in his car because they claimed he supported Donald Trump.
[00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:48.710]  On the flip side, we've got complete hysteria.
[00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:57.254]  The media, the left, freaking out about hate crimes blamed on Trump supporters that were completely staged.
[00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:04.598]  Meanwhile, actual hate crimes are being carried out against innocent people and they claim it's not even a hate crime.
[00:05:04.618 --> 00:05:07.960]  We're going to get to the shocking video after the break on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:08.881]  Don't go away.
[00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:15.366]  Well, that's what I asked.
[00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:40.494]  So what really is going on?
[00:05:40.614 --> 00:05:47.718]  See, something is going on under the scene, behind the scenes maybe, something that's much more serious.
[00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.122]  On the surface, we can conclude that, well, what Obama is trying to do
[00:05:55.263 --> 00:06:01.925]  is to box Trump in so that he can't restore relations with Russia.
[00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:11.849]  That itself doesn't seem all that believable because Trump can rescind the sanctions in 21 days when he's inaugurated.
[00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:18.414]  And so we should perhaps consider that there is more going on than meets the eye.
[00:06:19.114 --> 00:06:23.117]  This may be preparing the ground for some kind of incident.
[00:06:23.298 --> 00:06:23.978]  I don't know.
[00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:31.764]  But if I was the Russian government, I would be thinking about putting the armed services on some kind of alert.
[00:06:32.985 --> 00:06:36.047]  I wouldn't just sit there and say, well, this is Obama being silly.
[00:06:36.407 --> 00:06:38.108]  Man, you're absolutely right.
[00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:47.553]  I mean, he's sending the troops in to surround Russia and saying, ah, don't worry, guys, we're just provoking World War III and have a happy Christmas and a great New Year.
[00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:53.076]  Disclaimer, this report is provided, as is, for informational purposes only.
[00:06:53.356 --> 00:07:00.240]  Department of Homeland Security does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information contained within.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:13.369]  When you say what this disclaimer does, it says that we really can't even verify that our description of their tools and infrastructure is correct.
[00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:24.177]  So we have no evidence that the alleged infrastructure was used for the purposes that Obama says.
[00:07:25.058 --> 00:07:35.767]  And then we have a disclaimer that the report on the nature of the infrastructure and tools cannot be warranted.
[00:07:35.867 --> 00:07:39.651]  They don't really stand behind this.
[00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:50.220]  Wow, and that is incredible because here we're thinking that we are going to be getting this bombshell information once they finally decide to brief the House Intelligence Committee.
[00:07:50.881 --> 00:07:58.287]  Even Donald Trump is saying, I think it's time everyone wants to move on to bigger and better things, but I'll wait and find out what they know about the Russians.
[00:07:58.367 --> 00:07:59.768]  He's even trying to be patient.
[00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:06.214]  But here you're saying they still have not provided any actual hardcore evidence to
[00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:15.094]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:19.322]  But the truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:23.209]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[00:08:24.572 --> 00:08:24.732]  Now...
[00:08:25.754 --> 00:08:29.797]  Just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[00:08:30.117 --> 00:08:33.879]  The war is happening within our hearts, within our souls, within our minds.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.981]  We have to be good.
[00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:37.482]  We have to be pure.
[00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:38.342]  We have to be strong.
[00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:40.123]  We have to build prosperity.
[00:08:40.504 --> 00:08:43.025]  We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together.
[00:08:44.466 --> 00:08:49.950]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants, who believe we were going to fail, who believe their divide and conquer would work.
[00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.071]  Yes!
[00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:53.332]  We've won the first phase.
[00:08:54.053 --> 00:08:54.473]  The battle.
[00:08:55.575 --> 00:09:01.909]  For the soul of humanity has just begun, but Obama and Hillary and Soros.
[00:09:20.432 --> 00:09:24.537]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:09:24.557 --> 00:09:25.037]  Move bitch!
[00:09:25.137 --> 00:09:25.918]  Get out the way!
[00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:38.157]  It's the one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[00:09:38.297 --> 00:09:43.019]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:46.600]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:47.941]  I will not let you down.
[00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:51.662]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:53.363]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:09:53.383 --> 00:09:55.964]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:09:55.964 --> 00:10:00.989]  It means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:03.291]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:04.792]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:31.577]  Can you imagine if four white Trump supporters had kidnapped a mentally disabled black person, abducted him, kept him prisoner for up to two days, tortured him, forced him to drink toilet water, scalped him, abused him, beat him?
[00:10:32.927 --> 00:10:34.750]  Slung racial slurs at him.
[00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:36.894]  How would the left react?
[00:10:36.934 --> 00:10:38.717]  How do you think the left would react?
[00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:39.678]  Would they condemn it?
[00:10:39.999 --> 00:10:40.800]  Would they be shocked?
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.922]  Would they be outraged?
[00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:42.803]  Well, of course they would.
[00:10:43.324 --> 00:10:45.267]  And would they say it was a hate crime?
[00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:47.170]  Racially motivated.
[00:10:48.427 --> 00:10:52.092]  Maybe also a motivation against the fact that the victim was mentally disabled.
[00:10:52.132 --> 00:10:54.375]  Yes, it's obviously a hate crime!
[00:10:54.735 --> 00:10:57.579]  And the left would say it was a hate crime.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.466]  The excuses they're already coming out with are absolutely just...
[00:11:03.487 --> 00:11:04.108]  Bizarre!
[00:11:04.528 --> 00:11:12.034]  In fact, I got one message from a Black Lives Matter supporter that said there was no proof that this kidnapping even happened.
[00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:22.502]  Even though the culprits have been arrested, it's all over the news, the victim is known, the victim is in hospital, some of them are still denying that it even happened.
[00:11:23.223 --> 00:11:28.868]  Of course, the second layer of denial is denial that this has anything to do with Black Lives Matter.
[00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:31.310]  Well, Black Lives Matter has nothing to do with this.
[00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.151]  What's the connection?
[00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:34.453]  Black Lives Matter is not a group.
[00:11:34.913 --> 00:11:37.455]  It's not an identifiable selection of people.
[00:11:37.736 --> 00:11:39.037]  It doesn't have a headquarters.
[00:11:40.435 --> 00:11:42.277]  Black Lives Matter is an ideology.
[00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:55.067]  It's a very bad ideology because it's inspired, it's motivated countless acts of brutality, of murder in the case of the five Dallas cops that were shot, that were killed.
[00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:02.578]  And that's no surprise given that, and I've spoke about this many times, no one seems to be that interested in picking up on it, apart from Infowars.
[00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:05.561]  Look at the origins of Black Lives Matter.
[00:12:06.182 --> 00:12:09.146]  The three far-left social justice warriors that founded it.
[00:12:09.686 --> 00:12:14.652]  The people that go out to all its events, not only do they chant for wanting dead cops,
[00:12:15.512 --> 00:12:22.622]  They chant for their ideological guru, their founding member, the inspiration behind Black Lives Matter.
[00:12:23.503 --> 00:12:25.346]  And that is somebody called Assata Shakur.
[00:12:26.314 --> 00:12:36.578]  Assata Shakur left the Black Panthers, she left several other militant black liberation groups back in the 70s, because she thought they weren't violent enough.
[00:12:36.678 --> 00:12:38.439]  This is a convicted cop killer.
[00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:45.381]  This is somebody who is on the FBI's most wanted domestic terrorist list, who is in Cuba.
[00:12:45.842 --> 00:12:48.323]  They keep trying to bring her back.
[00:12:48.383 --> 00:12:49.023]  They can't do it.
[00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:53.327]  This is the ideological guru behind Black Lives Matter.
[00:12:53.347 --> 00:12:55.931]  This is whose name they chant at their rallies.
[00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:57.894]  She's a convicted cop killer.
[00:12:58.134 --> 00:13:00.057]  She's a domestic terrorist.
[00:13:01.249 --> 00:13:13.495]  Is it any surprise that we see this violence now spilling over to 18-year-old mentally disabled people being abducted, being tortured in the name of this same ideology?
[00:13:13.895 --> 00:13:16.116]  Yes, of course there is a connection.
[00:13:16.456 --> 00:13:28.782]  Of course there is a connection to a culture that has, again, popularized anti-white racism to such an extent, it's so entrenched, that it's now not only acceptable, it's trendy!
[00:13:29.583 --> 00:13:30.203]  It's cool!
[00:13:31.553 --> 00:13:35.314]  Again, the last acceptable form of racism is racism against white people.
[00:13:35.674 --> 00:13:39.315]  We saw another flagrant example of it just two weeks ago, MTV.
[00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.816]  New Year's resolutions for white guys.
[00:13:41.836 --> 00:13:43.277]  Again, they had to take that video down.
[00:13:43.317 --> 00:13:44.397]  It got completely panned.
[00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:45.857]  Is there a shift?
[00:13:46.177 --> 00:13:52.159]  Are we finally starting to realize that you don't solve racism with more racism?
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.180]  Let's go to the video from Fox News.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.341]  This is the news report about the white
[00:13:58.717 --> 00:14:05.782]  Kidnap, victim, being abused, being scalped, being tortured by these four despicable individuals.
[00:14:05.822 --> 00:14:06.643]  Let's roll the clip.
[00:14:07.532 --> 00:14:14.678]  Investigators are taking a look at a Facebook live video showing a group of people holding a young man hostage.
[00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:22.945]  Chicago police tell us four people are in custody tonight and we must warn you the video we are about to show you may be considered graphic.
[00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:34.473]  Goof?
[00:14:36.734 --> 00:14:37.874]  Yeah.
[00:14:37.894 --> 00:14:41.295]  My sister said it's not funny, y'all.
[00:14:43.336 --> 00:14:46.877]  Chicago police were made aware of this video yesterday afternoon.
[00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:54.059]  A young African American woman streamed the video live on Facebook, showing at least four people holding a young white man hostage.
[00:14:54.359 --> 00:14:56.160]  He is repeatedly kicked and hit.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.361]  His scalp is cut, all while he is tied up with his mouth taped shut.
[00:15:01.926 --> 00:15:05.029]  Now bear in mind, that was just a clip of what happened.
[00:15:05.049 --> 00:15:06.972]  That was just a 10 second clip.
[00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:11.056]  There are other clips where they force him to drink toilet water.
[00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.059]  There are other clips where they threaten to kill him.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.003]  They threaten even more violent assault.
[00:15:17.063 --> 00:15:21.127]  And you can tell that this guy has a mental age of a young child.
[00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:25.235]  We know that he has special needs, learning disabilities.
[00:15:25.795 --> 00:15:30.698]  You can see how truly terrified he is at several points throughout this video.
[00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:34.981]  Again, they bound him, they gagged him, they cut up his clothes.
[00:15:36.482 --> 00:15:38.843]  Nobody can see this without completely condemning it.
[00:15:38.883 --> 00:15:41.925]  That's not what Black Lives Matter supporters on the left have done.
[00:15:42.505 --> 00:15:49.850]  They immediately sought to make excuses, saying that this was just stupid kids messing about, it was not a hate crime.
[00:15:50.626 --> 00:15:56.631]  Well, let me read to you Chicago hate crime law before we play the clips from what the police said about this.
[00:15:57.172 --> 00:16:09.483]  Chicago law states a person commits a hate crime when by reason of the actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability,
[00:16:10.683 --> 00:16:18.065]  or national origin, regardless of the existence of any other motivating factor or factors, he commits assault, battery, aggravated assault, okay?
[00:16:18.505 --> 00:16:21.946]  Key terms there, race and mental disability.
[00:16:22.686 --> 00:16:34.909]  Throughout this video, it's made clear, one, that they've taken advantage of this poor individual because of his mental disability, he wouldn't have agreed to go there with them in the first place, and two, constantly
[00:16:35.549 --> 00:16:46.599]  F white people, forcing him to say he loves black people while he's being taunted and tormented by four black people while racial slurs are hurled in his direction.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:55.327]  Clear, not only political motive, clear racial motive, clear hate crime up and down.
[00:16:55.968 --> 00:16:57.909]  Again, flip it around, if this was four white people,
[00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:10.356]  Yeah, chanting at somebody, F black people, F Barack Obama, say you love white people, blatant racial motive, blatant racist hate crime.
[00:17:10.616 --> 00:17:15.618]  But here's what Chicago police said about the motivation behind this attack.
[00:17:15.638 --> 00:17:16.679]  Let's roll clip one.
[00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:21.630]  You know, although they are adults, they're 18.
[00:17:22.871 --> 00:17:24.092]  Kids make stupid decisions.
[00:17:24.152 --> 00:17:28.975]  I shouldn't call them kids, they're legally adults, but they're young adults and they make stupid decisions.
[00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:40.543]  That certainly will be part of whether or not a hate crime is, if we seek a hate crime, to determine whether or not this is sincere or just stupid ranting and raving.
[00:17:42.404 --> 00:17:45.305]  That was Chicago Police Department Commander Kevin Duffin.
[00:17:45.325 --> 00:17:46.205]  Again, this is what he said.
[00:18:01.465 --> 00:18:04.246]  Well, again, look at the hate crime law.
[00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:15.689]  There's nothing in the Chicago hate crime law that says, oh, if you think that there's also stupid ranting and raving in the commission of this criminal act, then maybe it's not a hate crime.
[00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:15.929]  No.
[00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.910]  There's nothing in the law that says that.
[00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:26.693]  In the law, it says a person commits a hate crime if the motivation is by perceived race or mental disability.
[00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:30.654]  Those are just two of the provisions while conducting
[00:18:31.354 --> 00:18:34.475]  Assault, battery, or aggravated assault, okay?
[00:18:35.435 --> 00:18:36.975]  What do they say during the attack?
[00:18:37.255 --> 00:18:38.056]  F white people.
[00:18:38.476 --> 00:18:40.656]  Forcing him to say he loves black people.
[00:18:41.316 --> 00:18:43.917]  Throughout the entire video, racial slurs.
[00:18:44.037 --> 00:18:45.537]  An obvious motivation.
[00:18:46.057 --> 00:18:50.018]  Only an idiot or a liar could ever deny that.
[00:18:50.118 --> 00:18:53.459]  But that's exactly what the Chicago police are doing.
[00:18:54.019 --> 00:19:00.521]  If this was flipped around, if this was reversed, and it was four white people, racial slurs.
[00:19:02.068 --> 00:19:10.853]  Some of it is just stupidity.
[00:19:10.893 --> 00:19:20.338]  You know, people just ranting about something that they think might make a headline.
[00:19:20.738 --> 00:19:30.723]  I don't think that, at this point, we don't have anything concrete to really point us in that direction, but we'll keep investigating and we'll let the facts guide us on how this concludes.
[00:19:32.287 --> 00:19:43.220]  So again, that is Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson saying, if you look at the video, and we've just looked at the video, I've watched the whole thing, quote, it's just stupidity.
[00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:49.128]  And he said no on whether his department was currently treating the incident as a hate crime.
[00:19:50.578 --> 00:20:03.110]  This is not the left wing, this is not Black Lives Matter supporters, this is the police department in Chicago there, saying that there's no evidence of a hate crime, when throughout the video there's clear evidence of a hate crime.
[00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.173]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show, live breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[00:20:06.634 --> 00:20:07.014]  Let's go.
[00:20:09.821 --> 00:20:11.663]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:20:11.703 --> 00:20:12.784]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:20:13.044 --> 00:20:13.965]  Why is this so good?
[00:20:14.265 --> 00:20:19.489]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:33.160]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.602]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:20:35.362 --> 00:20:36.923]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:39.504]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:20:39.584 --> 00:20:40.844]  These are all parasites.
[00:20:40.905 --> 00:20:41.985]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:20:42.005 --> 00:20:43.045]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:20:43.366 --> 00:20:47.707]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:20:47.888 --> 00:20:51.049]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:54.212]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.254]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:20:55.314 --> 00:20:57.196]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.277]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:20:58.297 --> 00:21:00.379]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.024]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:04.284 --> 00:21:06.186]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:21:06.567 --> 00:21:08.529]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:21:14.249 --> 00:21:19.133]  I've been around the reporting game for over 30 years, so I've known lots of reporters.
[00:21:20.454 --> 00:21:25.057]  Lots of reporters, some editors, people who work in the mainstream.
[00:21:26.238 --> 00:21:27.019]  What are they doing?
[00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.360]  What's their psychology?
[00:21:29.446 --> 00:21:32.250]  First of all, their talent's spotted.
[00:21:32.931 --> 00:21:34.013]  You understand what that means?
[00:21:34.674 --> 00:21:39.321]  Somebody picks him out and says, this kid is fairly smart, he's kind of bright, let's bring him in, it could be good.
[00:21:39.822 --> 00:21:43.547]  And he believes what we want our people to believe.
[00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.949]  Already.
[00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.271]  He believes in globalism.
[00:21:47.331 --> 00:21:52.034]  He believes that we're all one happy, sappy, global village.
[00:21:52.135 --> 00:21:57.798]  He believes that parents should be taking care of their own kids if the state wants to intervene.
[00:21:58.439 --> 00:22:03.482]  He believes that communities should be planned by the United Nations if necessary.
[00:22:03.942 --> 00:22:07.305]  People live in little tiny little spaces and so forth.
[00:22:07.805 --> 00:22:11.447]  Kick people who are living out in so that migrants can live there.
[00:22:11.487 --> 00:22:15.030]  You know, he's already on board, all right?
[00:22:16.212 --> 00:22:17.915]  This is key and crucial.
[00:22:18.477 --> 00:22:19.759]  They bring these people in.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.783]  They can smell them a mile away.
[00:22:21.884 --> 00:22:22.485]  So can you.
[00:22:22.525 --> 00:22:23.687]  So can I. So can they.
[00:22:25.365 --> 00:22:27.587]  Guy walks through the door, he's 24 years old.
[00:22:28.087 --> 00:22:32.410]  He's got a master's degree from, you know, jerk university.
[00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.792]  And, oh yes, very good.
[00:22:34.832 --> 00:22:41.537]  Sits down, and right away the editor who's interviewing him, or the personnel guy at the New York Times, or wherever it is.
[00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:43.799]  Sniff, sniff, sniff.
[00:22:43.899 --> 00:22:52.726]  Yep, I can smell this guy is a liberal, which means he's really a globalist, and he's a communist, and he's a socialist, and he doesn't even have to know what that means.
[00:22:53.565 --> 00:22:54.446]  You know, the reporter.
[00:22:55.347 --> 00:22:58.309]  He just thinks he does, so that's what we want.
[00:22:58.729 --> 00:23:03.673]  And then he can write articles from the angle that we want him to write articles from, and that's how the game works.
[00:23:04.913 --> 00:23:05.894]  That's really what it is.
[00:23:06.675 --> 00:23:08.416]  They smell the same smell.
[00:23:08.556 --> 00:23:10.377]  I mean, it really comes down to that.
[00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:11.919]  Oh yeah, he's one of us.
[00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:13.680]  Sure, he talks like us.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.961]  I can tell he thinks like us.
[00:23:15.001 --> 00:23:16.082]  He acts like us.
[00:23:16.102 --> 00:23:17.303]  His attitude is like us.
[00:23:18.924 --> 00:23:20.365]  It's kind of like, uh...
[00:23:22.074 --> 00:23:25.055]  Semi-high IQ mucus.
[00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:25.976]  Okay?
[00:23:26.976 --> 00:23:28.477]  That's what I think of it as.
[00:23:29.017 --> 00:23:37.300]  Oh yes, I'm spotting in Jones, our newest candidate for reporter, a semi-high IQ mucus.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.141]  Yes, very good.
[00:23:39.221 --> 00:23:40.601]  Yes, I think he'll be fine.
[00:23:40.681 --> 00:23:41.742]  He'll be fine.
[00:23:41.922 --> 00:23:42.382]  One of us.
[00:23:45.403 --> 00:23:47.584]  And they are going all in.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:55.963]  Risking everything, major media I'm talking about, with the most fantastical stories.
[00:23:57.163 --> 00:23:59.244]  You know, that are just ridiculous.
[00:24:00.164 --> 00:24:05.126]  The Russians and the Putin and this and that and all the fake news sites are really working for who?
[00:24:05.446 --> 00:24:05.787]  Russia?
[00:24:05.847 --> 00:24:06.207]  What?
[00:24:06.407 --> 00:24:08.468]  You know, they are going crazy.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:33.785]  Barack Obama infamously inserted himself into the Trayvon Martin and the Michael Brown cases, even though in the case of Michael Brown it was an obvious open and shut case.
[00:24:33.845 --> 00:24:36.767]  Of course, he tried to grab officer Darren Wilson's gun.
[00:24:37.327 --> 00:24:40.028]  It was by no means how the media initially portrayed it.
[00:24:40.068 --> 00:24:41.889]  Those facts quickly came to light.
[00:24:42.209 --> 00:24:45.371]  But nevertheless, Obama inserted himself into that anyway.
[00:24:45.691 --> 00:24:48.152]  He inserted himself into the Trayvon Brown case.
[00:24:48.632 --> 00:24:49.853]  Will Obama
[00:24:50.313 --> 00:24:53.135]  Make a comment on this shocking case.
[00:24:53.175 --> 00:24:59.080]  This is a guy whose entire administration was supposed to be, you know, be about calming race relations.
[00:24:59.941 --> 00:25:02.142]  Being about moving on from the past.
[00:25:02.563 --> 00:25:03.644]  Building bridges.
[00:25:04.514 --> 00:25:10.181]  Of course, America has never been more racially divided thanks to Barack Obama.
[00:25:10.461 --> 00:25:18.811]  Thanks to his administration, which at every point, and in fact Obama himself, has met with Black Lives Matter leaders.
[00:25:19.252 --> 00:25:22.396]  In fact, Hillary Clinton said that she would change laws
[00:25:23.646 --> 00:25:26.427]  When they were demanded by Black Lives Matter leaders.
[00:25:26.827 --> 00:25:33.069]  This is a violent, intolerant hate group that has inspired actual murderers.
[00:25:33.489 --> 00:25:37.050]  Not just beatings of white people, actual murders of cops.
[00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:38.831]  Some of them black cops.
[00:25:39.611 --> 00:25:44.893]  In these ambush style attacks across the country that has now led to the Ferguson effect.
[00:25:46.021 --> 00:25:51.863]  Where cops are being attacked and ambushed to such a degree that they don't want to go into these high-crime areas.
[00:25:52.404 --> 00:25:53.164]  So what happens?
[00:25:53.224 --> 00:26:01.547]  Well, you get more crime in cities like Chicago, where black-on-black shootings, black people dying, is through the roof.
[00:26:02.048 --> 00:26:05.369]  But Black Lives Matter doesn't give a damn about that, do they?
[00:26:05.769 --> 00:26:12.332]  They don't give a damn about little six-year-old girls on street corners being shot in the head with stray bullets.
[00:26:13.112 --> 00:26:14.692]  During drive-by shootings.
[00:26:15.213 --> 00:26:16.393]  They don't give a damn about that.
[00:26:16.793 --> 00:26:25.755]  That's the primary cause of black people dying and they don't give a damn about it if they can't use it for race-baiting, if they can't use it for political division.
[00:26:27.136 --> 00:26:29.196]  So is Obama gonna come out and comment on this?
[00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:29.976]  Obviously not!
[00:26:30.856 --> 00:26:32.717]  There's a petition for him to do so.
[00:26:33.637 --> 00:26:35.638]  One of those petitions up on whitehouse.gov.
[00:26:35.658 --> 00:26:40.399]  Again, he inserted himself into Mike Brown case, inserted himself into the Trayvon Martin case,
[00:26:41.363 --> 00:26:44.269]  Will he have anything to say about this?
[00:26:44.749 --> 00:26:53.185]  Will he drag up the same tired old excuse that the left is using right now, that this was just stupid kids messing around?
[00:26:54.366 --> 00:26:59.731]  You've had a culture that's been bathed in this idea that hating white people is trendy.
[00:27:00.011 --> 00:27:02.193]  This whole F. Donald Trump movement.
[00:27:02.773 --> 00:27:11.300]  Again, upheld, legitimized by popular culture, by the mainstream media, by the likes of BuzzFeed, by the likes of MTV.
[00:27:12.842 --> 00:27:14.963]  All along it was upheld, it was popularized.
[00:27:15.444 --> 00:27:17.566]  In defense of looting, Time Magazine again.
[00:27:18.502 --> 00:27:23.886]  Supporting criminality amongst the black community, even if it targets their own community.
[00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:28.790]  This is the narrative that's been dominant for the past two years plus.
[00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:35.235]  So of course it's going to lead to more racial hate crime attacks, which is exactly what's happening.
[00:27:35.715 --> 00:27:43.461]  While the left, of course, fakes and hoaxes their own hate crime attacks to blame them on Donald Trump supporters.
[00:27:43.881 --> 00:27:47.444]  And we've had numerous instances of that over the past few months.
[00:27:48.382 --> 00:27:51.786]  So the Chicago police came out and basically said it doesn't look like a hate crime.
[00:27:52.727 --> 00:27:53.988]  It was just kids messing about.
[00:27:54.348 --> 00:27:59.534]  This is what CNN panelist Simone Sanders said last night on Don Lemon's show.
[00:27:59.574 --> 00:28:00.255]  Let's roll the clip.
[00:28:00.942 --> 00:28:01.142]  I think
[00:28:20.952 --> 00:28:35.757]  Anytime someone says something or does something really egregious, really bad, and sickening in this instance, in connection with the President-elect, or Donald Trump, or even President Obama for that matter, because of their political leanings, that is slippery territory.
[00:28:36.097 --> 00:28:36.978]  That is not a hate crime.
[00:28:37.018 --> 00:28:43.020]  Hate crimes are because of a person's racial ethnicity, their religion, their gender, a disability.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:48.602]  It is in your political leanings, because someone doesn't like your political leanings, and they do something bad to you, that is not a hate crime.
[00:28:50.151 --> 00:28:55.534]  So she's saying that it's not a hate crime because it's politically motivated.
[00:28:55.574 --> 00:28:56.994]  They're saying F Donald Trump.
[00:28:57.275 --> 00:28:58.795]  This has nothing to do with race.
[00:28:59.095 --> 00:29:01.177]  It's not a racially motivated hate crime.
[00:29:01.597 --> 00:29:02.657]  It may be political.
[00:29:02.777 --> 00:29:04.078]  It's definitely not racial.
[00:29:05.058 --> 00:29:07.820]  How many times in the video do they say F white people?
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.842]  How many times in the video do they make him say I love black people?
[00:29:12.958 --> 00:29:15.022]  It's obviously racially motivated.
[00:29:15.082 --> 00:29:18.589]  That is a flat-out lie that it's not racially motivated.
[00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:24.260]  She's deliberately excised the fact that they're saying, F white people.
[00:29:25.287 --> 00:29:29.629]  Now this is a woman, this CNN contributor, Simone Sanders.
[00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:42.636]  You remember the video out of Chicago a few months ago where the white guy gets jumped, gets dragged in his car while he's hanging out the car door, gets beaten up by these thugs because they thought he voted for Donald Trump.
[00:29:42.656 --> 00:29:49.460]  Wasn't even any evidence that he voted for Donald Trump and he said he didn't anyway, but they don't care about that, it was an opportunity to rob him.
[00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.931]  What did she have to say about that?
[00:29:52.011 --> 00:29:54.814]  She said, quote, oh my goodness, poor white people.
[00:29:55.834 --> 00:29:58.677]  Again, so just not even condemnation of this.
[00:29:58.717 --> 00:30:00.819]  We'll be back with more on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:19.001]  We have an article that's up on our website, written by Clifford Cunningham, and it talks about how the Communist Chinese government is moving against Trump, asserting control over strategic ports.
[00:30:19.221 --> 00:30:29.225]  Now, the state-controlled corporations are masquerading as private entities, and they're accelerating their plan to acquire control over deep water ports and major shipping lanes across the world.
[00:30:29.505 --> 00:30:42.336]  The Sri Lankan government, heavily indebted to China, recently agreed to lease approximately 80% of a strategic port in the southern part of the country to the Chinese government, a company masquerading as private for $1.1 billion.
[00:30:42.517 --> 00:30:53.026]  Now the port lies along an important trade route connecting Asia to the Middle East, and it's a key part of the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road plan to expand Chinese control over key shipping lanes.
[00:30:53.166 --> 00:31:02.128]  All of this news comes as President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to take a stronger stance with China and trade, specifically when it comes to imports.
[00:31:02.249 --> 00:31:05.809]  It looks like they're moving ahead of the game and salvaging whatever they can.
[00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.790]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:09.751 --> 00:31:15.912]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:31:16.452 --> 00:31:17.873]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:20.690]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:26.811]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:31:27.411 --> 00:31:35.393]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[00:31:35.813 --> 00:31:37.874]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[00:31:38.154 --> 00:31:39.374]  This is the best system out there.
[00:31:39.614 --> 00:31:42.395]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[00:31:42.635 --> 00:31:43.375]  This is how it works.
[00:31:43.675 --> 00:31:44.196]  You order.
[00:31:44.316 --> 00:31:45.116]  Customized or
[00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:47.665]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:31:48.145 --> 00:31:51.307]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:31:51.607 --> 00:31:55.670]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:56.650]  You cannot lose.
[00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:57.811]  You're funding the info war.
[00:31:58.091 --> 00:32:04.855]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:32:05.155 --> 00:32:09.137]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:32:09.658 --> 00:32:11.579]  If you look at Bill Clinton,
[00:32:12.459 --> 00:32:12.979]  Far worse.
[00:32:13.219 --> 00:32:14.900]  Minor words and his was action.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.021]  His was what he's done to women.
[00:32:17.061 --> 00:32:22.724]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[00:32:22.944 --> 00:32:25.265]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[00:32:25.625 --> 00:32:30.527]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[00:32:30.607 --> 00:32:31.808]  Four of them here tonight.
[00:32:31.928 --> 00:32:37.230]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[00:32:48.069 --> 00:32:50.812]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:32:51.673 --> 00:32:53.134]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:32:53.795 --> 00:32:55.717]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:32:56.057 --> 00:33:00.261]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:33:00.401 --> 00:33:03.745]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:33:03.825 --> 00:33:05.366]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:33:18.732 --> 00:33:22.655]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:23.296 --> 00:33:28.560]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.329 --> 00:33:41.531]  I remember back in July of 2016.
[00:33:41.611 --> 00:33:46.676]  Seems like just minutes ago, but it was over half a year ago.
[00:33:49.053 --> 00:33:58.001]  I was in Cleveland, Ohio, covering the RNC.
[00:33:58.962 --> 00:34:02.865]  And I went over to the Ritz Carlton, where the Maine Republicans were staying.
[00:34:04.246 --> 00:34:11.312]  And I met with a lot of the different Fox News officials, their vice presidents, their programming people.
[00:34:12.513 --> 00:34:13.795]  And we talked about Megyn Kelly.
[00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:17.774]  And I said, Megyn Kelly, this is only like six, seven months ago now.
[00:34:18.655 --> 00:34:21.256]  It seems like again, just yesterday, but also a lifetime ago.
[00:34:22.016 --> 00:34:23.477]  Megyn Kelly is your bellwether.
[00:34:24.317 --> 00:34:36.323]  If she can successfully convert your audience to hating conservatism, hating libertarianism, buying into worshiping this dead political horse Hillary, then you've won.
[00:34:36.343 --> 00:34:42.586]  But I said, I think Megyn Kelly is going to destroy herself in this battle with Donald Trump and the American people.
[00:34:43.479 --> 00:34:44.080]  And they agreed with me.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.063]  They said, no, we're already seeing ratings slide.
[00:34:46.424 --> 00:34:47.605]  She had the top ratings on the channel.
[00:34:49.749 --> 00:34:54.075]  And now, she's moved on to the Peacock Network NBC.
[00:34:54.176 --> 00:34:55.357]  It's itself a total joke.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.002]  And it's, you know, bad son.
[00:35:00.123 --> 00:35:03.504]  MSNBC and CNBC and Microsoft and all the rest of them.
[00:35:03.525 --> 00:35:06.346]  I mean, this is truly a train wreck we're watching.
[00:35:06.886 --> 00:35:10.427]  But it shows how she gets her hair done in Manhattan.
[00:35:10.888 --> 00:35:12.568]  She's this beautiful little elf woman.
[00:35:12.608 --> 00:35:14.349]  She's like an old lady to me.
[00:35:14.389 --> 00:35:16.150]  I'm nothing as an old lady, but she's just soulless.
[00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.311]  And she still believes in the system.
[00:35:19.931 --> 00:35:25.834]  So Megyn Kelly, as the whole dinosaur media goes down, is emblematic of the fall
[00:35:27.699 --> 00:35:31.541]  Of the peacock, globalist, narcissistic brainwashing machine.
[00:35:32.382 --> 00:35:36.224]  I think that's really the takeaway from all of this I can bring you.
[00:35:38.865 --> 00:35:46.810]  Meanwhile, we're in the middle of this spectacular revolution against corporate tyranny and against monopolies worldwide.
[00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.992]  I mean, every nation you look at from Japan
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:51.440]  To
[00:36:10.878 --> 00:36:36.092]  The Netherlands with a nationalist in the lead in the presidential race right into the UK and Brexit and of course going back south Italy voting to begin to leave the euro just three weeks ago and Iceland and Reykjavik pulling out of the globalist combine and America with Trump Kind of got Canada going back to eat its own vomit with Trudeau
[00:36:37.108 --> 00:36:41.450]  But by and large, there are big positive things happening right now.
[00:36:43.091 --> 00:36:44.311]  Huge things are happening right now.
[00:36:46.552 --> 00:36:50.094]  And you look at these tarts, it's not that she's a woman.
[00:36:50.654 --> 00:36:52.415]  Some of the smartest people I know are women.
[00:36:53.075 --> 00:36:55.136]  But you have the archetype of the dumb guy, the dumb woman.
[00:36:55.176 --> 00:36:57.597]  I mean, Megyn Kelly is the dumb blonde cheerleader.
[00:36:58.723 --> 00:37:04.668]  Who looked okay 10 years ago on Fox, but now just looks like an ugly witch, because her soul is ugly.
[00:37:05.388 --> 00:37:08.751]  And she reportedly told friends, I'm ugly, I'm old now, I better join the liberals.
[00:37:09.231 --> 00:37:20.340]  She's wanting to go jump onto some failed ship, because she feels rejected after buying into the mainstream media's lie that Donald Trump was this evil guy.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.883]  This is just her thinking, my God, I'm hated at Fox.
[00:37:24.263 --> 00:37:27.666]  I'm hated by the viewers now, let me go to NBC.
[00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:34.916]  Because those failures, those vampires are ready to get whoever they can swindle into joining them.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.245]  But then I pull back, and I look at how...
[00:37:41.539 --> 00:37:47.621]  I'm just an average person who has a will and who's justice bound and who wants to promote freedom.
[00:37:47.981 --> 00:37:52.663]  Not that special, but I am special in that I don't join every peacock organization.
[00:37:53.343 --> 00:37:54.243]  I don't want to go.
[00:37:55.164 --> 00:38:06.968]  Anybody else who's successful like me, almost everybody, they go and there's weird functions and dinners and fake charity events where you walk down red carpets and they have people there to take photos of you just so you feel big.
[00:38:07.508 --> 00:38:10.069]  It's a whole vanity fair business of BS.
[00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.531]  That means nothing to me.
[00:38:13.911 --> 00:38:15.052]  I'll tell you what means something to me.
[00:38:15.713 --> 00:38:22.937]  I've probably been in Luby's cafeterias that are here in Texas and a few other states 500 times in my life.
[00:38:23.558 --> 00:38:25.779]  I mean, I grew up when I was a little kid going to them in Dallas.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.942]  And it wasn't until about six, seven years ago that I'd go to a Luby's.
[00:38:31.428 --> 00:38:40.475]  And I'd hear old ladies in the line, who had always been in line with us since I was a little kid, calling, I don't have the money for the Louie and those little purse bags.
[00:38:40.535 --> 00:38:44.299]  And I started getting tears in my eyes, because they weren't saying this for me.
[00:38:44.319 --> 00:38:46.981]  They were talking to their old lady friends like they didn't have money for food.
[00:38:47.001 --> 00:38:49.543]  This is their one day out a week to get this food.
[00:38:49.563 --> 00:38:59.091]  And I didn't want to make a scene or anything, but after this happened a few times, I'd sit there and say, hey, I'm getting all these people's food.
[00:39:00.572 --> 00:39:02.153]  And it wasn't that I was some angel or whatever.
[00:39:02.814 --> 00:39:05.375]  It was that my whole life, I'd gone there.
[00:39:05.395 --> 00:39:08.758]  I have early memories of being in like Louie's in Dallas when I was like two years old.
[00:39:09.759 --> 00:39:12.320]  And I never heard people bitching and complaining they couldn't pay for the food.
[00:39:12.501 --> 00:39:14.482]  And the food was lower quality.
[00:39:14.702 --> 00:39:15.743]  The food was even cheaper.
[00:39:16.083 --> 00:39:17.424]  But inflation, all the lies.
[00:39:17.484 --> 00:39:20.286]  And I saw the news saying, oh, there's no inflation.
[00:39:20.606 --> 00:39:21.447]  Our economy's great.
[00:39:21.667 --> 00:39:23.368]  Obama said we had the best economy we've ever had.
[00:39:23.889 --> 00:39:26.411]  In between speeches saying you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[00:39:27.051 --> 00:39:33.565]  Well, he's on a jumbo jet and playing golf 100 days a year and sitting around delusional because he's black.
[00:39:33.605 --> 00:39:37.554]  So it's okay to say black people got to be poor and watch their unemployment double.
[00:39:38.547 --> 00:39:43.570]  He was chosen by these sick, inbred, corporate, blue blood, white people on average.
[00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:45.070]  You want to get down to bashing white people?
[00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.131]  Yeah, most of these folks are white running this thing.
[00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:50.913]  They're playing us all off against each other to screw us over.
[00:39:51.233 --> 00:40:00.838]  We got a bunch of narcissists who want to be on their news, their shows, their channels to feel like we've arrived, so we'll sell our own family out to be part of them.
[00:40:01.078 --> 00:40:02.179]  So let me give you the newsflash.
[00:40:03.519 --> 00:40:05.180]  I've been on air 21 years, almost 22 years.
[00:40:07.771 --> 00:40:09.092]  In April, it'll be 22 years.
[00:40:10.614 --> 00:40:13.237]  And I don't say this to say I'm some big badass.
[00:40:15.299 --> 00:40:21.125]  I say this so you realize that Wall Street, Madison Avenue, all of it have nothing to offer you.
[00:40:21.205 --> 00:40:21.766]  It's a fraud.
[00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:22.867]  It won't fulfill you.
[00:40:24.328 --> 00:40:25.990]  I've been in major movies.
[00:40:26.711 --> 00:40:29.714]  I didn't realize early on I was getting a little offer to join them.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.060]  Maybe I wasn't.
[00:40:32.761 --> 00:40:33.761]  But the later offers were.
[00:40:34.302 --> 00:40:36.363]  You want a book deal every year for $3 million.
[00:40:36.663 --> 00:40:39.965]  You want to be in major motion pictures up to $10 million a year.
[00:40:40.365 --> 00:40:43.307]  You want $10 million three-year contracts for radio.
[00:40:43.647 --> 00:40:45.348]  We're ready to write the ticket.
[00:40:45.428 --> 00:40:48.450]  You will be the next Rush Limbaugh before they got back.
[00:40:49.631 --> 00:40:50.171]  I told them no.
[00:40:50.191 --> 00:40:55.214]  They said, I am the president of programming at this major network.
[00:40:55.795 --> 00:40:57.256]  I don't make $2 million a year.
[00:40:57.596 --> 00:40:59.157]  You're going to turn down $3.5 million a year.
[00:40:59.177 --> 00:41:00.418]  I said, you're damn right I am.
[00:41:01.118 --> 00:41:02.099]  And that was hard to do.
[00:41:02.899 --> 00:41:04.160]  My integrity.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.262]  It's like saying, would you give up your eyeballs for a billion dollars?
[00:41:08.462 --> 00:41:09.523]  Frickin' hell no!
[00:41:09.543 --> 00:41:10.624]  Dude, blind?
[00:41:10.864 --> 00:41:11.644]  I've got a billion dollars?
[00:41:11.664 --> 00:41:12.185]  No way!
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.261]  I will not give up my soul for any amount of money.
[00:41:16.521 --> 00:41:20.563]  That isn't some rocket scientist, badass, cool hero move.
[00:41:21.943 --> 00:41:24.804]  That's a normal move of somebody that's awake and alive.
[00:41:26.585 --> 00:41:28.045]  It isn't hard to say no to this.
[00:41:28.506 --> 00:41:41.770]  That's what I don't get, is that it's so clear to me, and let's be frank, Infowars is leading the world in game-changing, trailblazing resistance to this, but I don't understand why we're king.
[00:41:43.689 --> 00:41:44.690]  I actually feel pathetic.
[00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:45.470]  I feel dirty.
[00:41:46.391 --> 00:41:48.793]  My half-ass attempt at this is the best we got?
[00:41:50.735 --> 00:41:53.056]  Pull my eyes out with pliers, I get a billion dollars?
[00:41:54.217 --> 00:41:54.458]  No!
[00:41:56.199 --> 00:41:57.060]  Take my soul?
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.521]  Who I am?
[00:41:58.561 --> 00:41:59.442]  What I stand for?
[00:42:00.662 --> 00:42:01.143]  For money?
[00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:12.927]  To go to some weird peacock event with a bunch of empty people, a bunch of women all freaked out, worshipping celebrity, so I could be in front of them and get an award like Tom Hanks.
[00:42:13.047 --> 00:42:16.990]  Let me tell you something, I've watched these red carpet events and I've been at some of them.
[00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:26.217]  And people like Tom Hanks and others will run around for two hours to cameras on the red carpet and just hide, like they just arrived.
[00:42:29.434 --> 00:42:31.354]  And it's all just a reflection of emptiness.
[00:42:31.434 --> 00:42:34.115]  It's like, thank God I'm not like these people.
[00:42:35.155 --> 00:42:38.956]  But then I see my fellow humans totally obsessed with this.
[00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:55.420]  Edward Bernays, 100 years ago, the nephew of Sigmund Freud, he was the one in the 20s that got media, entertainment, politicians merged with burgeoning Hollywood, and who made it like, we don't stand for politicians because of what they do, or what they stand for.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.721]  It's that they look good, and they were on TV with a movie star.
[00:42:59.881 --> 00:43:04.647]  So we've been stuck in this for 90-something years and we're coming out of it.
[00:43:08.912 --> 00:43:12.437]  See, they want to teach you that you don't have the essence of the universe within you.
[00:43:13.418 --> 00:43:17.363]  That you're there in your little apartment, your kids are bitching and you're eating, you know,
[00:43:18.547 --> 00:43:20.549]  And none of it means anything.
[00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:21.329]  It's all completely empty.
[00:43:53.603 --> 00:43:57.327]  I've been to the top and I've been at the bottom.
[00:43:58.668 --> 00:44:00.049]  And I say I'm at the top.
[00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:02.111]  I'm at the bottom.
[00:44:02.131 --> 00:44:02.931]  It's all upside down.
[00:44:07.635 --> 00:44:15.001]  Sitting in a farmhouse with fields around you with your family and growing food and being a good person and knowing your neighbors.
[00:44:23.547 --> 00:44:24.588]  Transcends all of this.
[00:44:26.229 --> 00:44:29.231]  And this whole system is there to destroy the destiny of the species.
[00:44:30.652 --> 00:44:36.296]  Trump doesn't believe in the golden palaces he lives in and the suits of the super hot wives.
[00:44:36.696 --> 00:44:40.319]  He does that because he knows that's what you've been captured by.
[00:44:40.959 --> 00:44:44.421]  And his whole life has been a plan to hijack their system.
[00:44:44.842 --> 00:44:46.523]  And they've only figured that out at the end.
[00:44:48.356 --> 00:44:51.459]  And that's what we're doing, but we didn't build a facade to hijack it.
[00:44:51.479 --> 00:44:55.823]  We're just directly jacking in with straight communication right to you.
[00:44:55.843 --> 00:45:00.127]  I want you to succeed, just like I want to succeed.
[00:45:00.147 --> 00:45:01.569]  When you fail, I fall.
[00:45:02.129 --> 00:45:06.033]  And together, we have to rediscover what it is to be human.
[00:45:06.874 --> 00:45:09.136]  And look, I want to be completely straight with everybody.
[00:45:10.902 --> 00:45:13.184]  Because I say we should be healthy and not eat GMO.
[00:45:14.085 --> 00:45:17.628]  Because I say we shouldn't drink too much, we should be strong, we shouldn't watch too much TV.
[00:45:17.969 --> 00:45:20.891]  It doesn't mean I don't do all the things I say you shouldn't do.
[00:45:21.612 --> 00:45:28.699]  It just means that my soul's pointed in the right direction and I am trying to tell you the things that I know from my core are best because I've experienced it.
[00:45:30.071 --> 00:45:39.376]  And I can assure you that the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard, the mind has not dreamt of what is in the potentiality of this species if we go to the next level.
[00:45:39.696 --> 00:45:41.437]  Look at everything we've done.
[00:45:42.178 --> 00:45:42.938]  I love dolphins.
[00:45:43.098 --> 00:45:45.640]  I love tigers.
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:46.500]  I love elephants.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.641]  They're magic creatures.
[00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:51.043]  They aren't 1-100 as magic as we are.
[00:45:52.384 --> 00:45:58.247]  But the problem is, is that an elephant's majestic, strong, beautiful, a tiger, it's all kind of in its spectrum.
[00:45:59.494 --> 00:46:00.776]  It doesn't have those lows.
[00:46:01.116 --> 00:46:01.937]  It doesn't have those highs.
[00:46:02.017 --> 00:46:04.961]  See, we can go to the very bottom of hell.
[00:46:06.583 --> 00:46:07.144]  We can meet the devil.
[00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:10.729]  Or we can transcend and join God.
[00:46:16.516 --> 00:46:21.278]  The spirit of evil is laying against us in an attempt to keep us from our birthright.
[00:46:22.219 --> 00:46:25.000]  And all I can tell you is the enemy's smart.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.362]  These churches, when I go even near them, I almost throw up.
[00:46:28.422 --> 00:46:29.563]  They are satanic.
[00:46:30.063 --> 00:46:33.244]  The enemy is in the churches, they're in the media, they're in the government at the top.
[00:46:34.105 --> 00:46:35.165]  It doesn't mean the government's our enemy.
[00:46:36.006 --> 00:46:45.991]  But I'm here to tell you, if you simply humble yourself and get before God, the destiny is waiting and we can have it all right now.
[00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:51.605]  Look at how chattel and sick all this crap is.
[00:46:52.186 --> 00:46:55.789]  All this tinfoil, all this color, all this crap, none of it means anything.
[00:46:56.389 --> 00:46:58.911]  What matters in this universe is passion.
[00:47:00.412 --> 00:47:03.655]  And the willingness to reach out for beauty and everything that's good.
[00:47:03.675 --> 00:47:14.003]  And in that experiment, in that turning our will over to everything that's good and everything that came before us, we transcend the mortal bonds to join God.
[00:47:15.124 --> 00:47:17.046]  And this whole world is about trying to suppress that.
[00:47:18.925 --> 00:47:36.228]  So on my beginning transmission of 2017, I commit to you, with all my warts and all our failings, that I will always be true to you, and that I know your spirit is a spirit that will chain the devil and restore humanity.
[00:47:37.574 --> 00:47:38.835]  So that our species not fail.
[00:47:39.135 --> 00:47:41.577]  Because the enemy is a spirit of death.
[00:47:42.037 --> 00:47:44.719]  Come to kill this planet and everything on it.
[00:47:44.999 --> 00:47:47.681]  And we are the guardians of this planet.
[00:47:49.323 --> 00:47:54.086]  And if we could prove ourselves at this level, it's a stairway to heaven.
[00:47:57.809 --> 00:48:00.491]  The fulfillment of human destiny is in your hands.
[00:48:01.291 --> 00:48:03.153]  And that's all I can tell you.
[00:48:09.676 --> 00:48:13.279]  Now we are going to skip this next break because we've got a very important report.
[00:48:13.319 --> 00:48:26.749]  Now we had this yesterday, but it was so prescient, it was so relevant to what happened just moments afterwards regarding the true agenda behind this race war, why it's being pushed by the media, by the popular culture.
[00:48:26.789 --> 00:48:27.930]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:48:28.931 --> 00:48:31.513]  What we have is exponential envy.
[00:48:32.133 --> 00:48:35.356]  We have globalists at the top that have used class warfare to control people.
[00:48:36.482 --> 00:48:42.387]  And then really all they do is make them feel worthless and disempowered and basically just zombies to the system.
[00:48:43.467 --> 00:48:53.075]  Frightened followers who then only tie in and buy into the larger superstructure that's destroying them because they believe they get power and solace by merging with that.
[00:48:53.675 --> 00:48:57.118]  And one of the most clear-cut examples of this is the last eight years.
[00:48:58.038 --> 00:49:02.482]  The Tea Party that was started by Ron Paul and the Liberty Movement, myself and the listeners of this broadcast,
[00:49:03.911 --> 00:49:06.012]  I did get partially co-opted by the Republican Party.
[00:49:06.872 --> 00:49:14.555]  But then the left all came in and just branded it as completely racist, completely evil, and so that no one of any color was welcome at those.
[00:49:15.115 --> 00:49:28.860]  Because they don't want minorities, who are the majority, to have this birthright and this freedom and be able to, you know, continue in the steps of prosperity with low taxes, the right to self-defense, property rights, things like that.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:30.660]  It was a stroke of genius.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.521]  The last six, seven years, they were able
[00:49:33.812 --> 00:49:37.233]  To really brand it as if it was something bad.
[00:49:37.433 --> 00:49:41.254]  And so minorities felt like they felt like they couldn't be part of that.
[00:49:41.274 --> 00:49:44.275]  And now they've just expanded.
[00:49:44.335 --> 00:49:46.216]  But Trump began the last two years to break that.
[00:49:46.236 --> 00:49:49.077]  And we've seen 30, 40 percent of the people at rallies being minorities.
[00:49:49.977 --> 00:49:53.421]  I mean, at our own rallies, which is like half in Cleveland.
[00:49:53.921 --> 00:49:55.383]  And that's what really shook up.
[00:49:55.403 --> 00:49:58.446]  I was watching the Mother Jones riders, other people that were there.
[00:49:58.466 --> 00:50:02.590]  They were really shook up and they were looking at the crowd and it was frightening the elite.
[00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:04.492]  It was really frightening the establishment.
[00:50:05.593 --> 00:50:18.756]  So now, while they're capitulating to the Trump victory and populism on the surface, all over the world they're going into overdrive, branding any type of populism by people that aren't blonde-haired, blue-eyed as racist.
[00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:34.499]  And I, on the newsstand before I got on this plane, I'm sitting there about to take off, so I gotta hurry, bought a Mother Jones, Ford Foundation propaganda piece, and of course the Council on Foreign Relations slash Davos group, Economist propaganda, and literally,
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.101]  Literally.
[00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:37.442]  This is what the pseudo-intellectuals read.
[00:50:38.042 --> 00:50:54.777]  The entire thing, on almost every page, shows blonde-haired, blue-eyed people, in real photos, but also in editorial cartoons, saying blonde-haired, blue-eyed people are bad, putting KKK hats on them, and then saying if someone looks like this, then they're your enemy.
[00:50:56.499 --> 00:51:02.701]  And these are publications that mainly go to the white intelligentsia, so they can go out now and henpeck everyone into this submission.
[00:51:02.941 --> 00:51:04.581]  This is just two things I got off the newsstand.
[00:51:04.901 --> 00:51:08.142]  I mean, this is the most cultic brainwashing I've ever seen.
[00:51:08.502 --> 00:51:10.863]  Clear-cut, cold-blooded, they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:51:11.323 --> 00:51:12.223]  But it's so transparent.
[00:51:12.523 --> 00:51:15.464]  If we just call it, it will collapse, and that's what's begun to happen.
[00:51:16.184 --> 00:51:18.365]  That's why they stole those five states from Trump.
[00:51:19.285 --> 00:51:23.666]  And they tried to sell another five, because the numbers were, minorities were even bigger in landslides for him.
[00:51:24.387 --> 00:51:25.409]  That's what we saw in the primary.
[00:51:26.212 --> 00:51:27.375]  So they're very, very scared.
[00:51:27.395 --> 00:51:28.679]  Their whole paradigm is shattering.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.968]  They're trying to invoke all this, but are real.
[00:51:34.301 --> 00:51:36.462]  Our real gang we're in is the free market.
[00:51:36.742 --> 00:51:37.703]  That's what unifies us.
[00:51:38.443 --> 00:51:39.744]  And Western civilization.
[00:51:40.704 --> 00:51:41.845]  And it's like Gran Torino.
[00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:44.947]  You know, it's a fictional account, but you know, the guy didn't like his spoiled family.
[00:51:44.987 --> 00:51:45.587]  He's a white guy.
[00:51:45.607 --> 00:51:48.208]  It's a sign of declining white culture, which is the truth.
[00:51:48.889 --> 00:51:57.333]  Western culture's in massive decline and he tries, he gives the love of his life, the Gran Torino, to the kid that made something of himself in the neighborhood.
[00:51:57.873 --> 00:52:00.415]  And that's not some affirmative action bull in the movie.
[00:52:00.475 --> 00:52:01.175]  It's like real.
[00:52:01.215 --> 00:52:02.436]  That's how it really works, folks.
[00:52:03.117 --> 00:52:07.423]  So they want to steal that birthright from everybody who's hard-working in a big part of America.
[00:52:08.524 --> 00:52:10.145]  I'm telling you, you don't get to be part of it.
[00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:11.487]  I'm telling you, you're in their gang.
[00:52:11.527 --> 00:52:12.408]  You're under their control.
[00:52:12.428 --> 00:52:14.489]  Because you're a victim and they're going to take care of you.
[00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:15.691]  And they know how to run your life.
[00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:18.413]  They're going to tell you how to talk and they're going to tell you what to do.
[00:52:18.433 --> 00:52:25.159]  So again, this is total desperation by the most scientific, cold-blooded psychological warfare divisions of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.963]  But most of the CIA is awake to this and now breaking with the whole deal.
[00:52:30.004 --> 00:52:33.427]  One other part of the psychological warfare of who they're targeting with these publications
[00:52:35.029 --> 00:52:37.791]  Is a lot of people that read these aren't actual controller level.
[00:52:37.811 --> 00:52:40.293]  They don't understand the paradigm or the Hegelian dialectic.
[00:52:41.174 --> 00:52:46.357]  But clearly, they're inflicting a guilt complex in the publications on anyone who is white or has blonde hair.
[00:52:47.058 --> 00:52:54.944]  You notice they also have photos of women with blonde hair and blue eyes, but in the ads, who are activists and then they're the good person.
[00:52:55.544 --> 00:52:59.948]  So it shows them who are good, and it shows the corporations that are backing it, but then it shows everyone else that it's bad.
[00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:03.151]  So that you think, oh my God, I have this guilt, I need to submit to this.
[00:53:03.492 --> 00:53:07.896]  I know I'm stating the obvious here, but it's just, it's key that we know this, the public doesn't.
[00:53:08.076 --> 00:53:11.119]  Once they understand the trick, they get angry, and they break free of the programming.
[00:53:11.139 --> 00:53:16.263]  And then the future programming only causes them to resist and entrench harder against the enemy.
[00:53:16.904 --> 00:53:19.907]  And then it opens up larger pathways for the mind to begin to resist.
[00:53:21.118 --> 00:53:25.444]  And over to come and adapt in the animating contest instead of submitting to it.
[00:53:25.544 --> 00:53:26.946]  That's why the public looks like zombies.
[00:53:27.306 --> 00:53:29.369]  Because subconsciously they know they've been beaten into submission.
[00:53:29.449 --> 00:53:30.330]  It's time to break that.
[00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:32.013]  So I'm going to follow this report.
[00:53:32.033 --> 00:53:32.914]  I'm going to follow more.
[00:53:32.934 --> 00:53:35.077]  I'm Alex Jones from Frontline's The Info War.
[00:53:35.097 --> 00:53:35.998]  A lot of positive.
[00:53:36.078 --> 00:53:36.298]  I think?
[00:54:11.243 --> 00:54:17.732]  Bombshell report there from Alex Jones about how the popular culture is pushing this thug culture.
[00:54:18.433 --> 00:54:19.514]  And I mean, it is that.
[00:54:19.835 --> 00:54:20.456]  It's the culture.
[00:54:20.496 --> 00:54:22.659]  It's not the skin colour of the perpetrators.
[00:54:22.679 --> 00:54:24.341]  That's how they try and deceive us again.
[00:54:24.401 --> 00:54:25.522]  How they try to divide us.
[00:54:25.943 --> 00:54:27.605]  Get us at each other's throats.
[00:54:28.366 --> 00:54:52.963]  And there was Thomas Sowell, the commentator, the writer, who talked about black kids born in Germany after the war between white German women and black US troops after the Second World War that weren't exposed to this same gangster thug culture, this illegitimacy that plagues black communities in the United States, this MTV gangster rap culture.
[00:54:53.263 --> 00:54:57.786]  They grew up to be just as educated as everybody else, just as successful as everybody else.
[00:54:58.466 --> 00:55:02.610]  And the crime stats were completely in line with everyone else in Germany.
[00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:10.817]  So it doesn't have anything to do with race, it has to do with this culture that's being rammed down our necks and then legitimized by the mainstream media.
[00:55:10.837 --> 00:55:19.805]  And we see it again in the aftermath of this horrific beating and abuse and torture of this 18-year-old mentally disabled man in Chicago.
[00:55:20.586 --> 00:55:34.613]  This is a city that has record shootings, record black-on-black crime, 54 people shot during the first four days of 2017 alone in gun-controlled Chicago.
[00:55:35.733 --> 00:55:38.635]  You don't see Black Lives Matter talking about that, do you?
[00:55:38.875 --> 00:55:42.517]  Despite the fact that the vast majority of victims are black.
[00:55:43.766 --> 00:55:50.409]  Black people killing each other far outstrips any kind of statistic when it comes to police shootings.
[00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:52.270]  But look at the reaction to this.
[00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:59.373]  Look at what Sean King tweeted, the big Black Lives Matter leader who was born white yet pretends to be black.
[00:56:00.113 --> 00:56:05.716]  Sean King just put out an article at the New York Daily News in regard to this torture and beating
[00:56:06.616 --> 00:56:11.638]  Bearing in mind this is the senior justice writer for the New York Daily News.
[00:56:11.698 --> 00:56:17.601]  He said, the simple reason why I won't be fighting for justice for the young man who was assaulted in Chicago.
[00:56:18.261 --> 00:56:23.604]  So the senior justice writer for the New York Daily News says he won't be fighting for justice.
[00:56:24.468 --> 00:56:25.948]  Because the victim's white.
[00:56:26.748 --> 00:56:30.529]  Again, another example of Black Lives Matter race-baiting.
[00:56:30.569 --> 00:56:33.430]  And then look at this, also from the New York Daily News.
[00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:35.710]  Torture attack on Illinois teen.
[00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.511]  Not racially motivated, say police.
[00:56:39.151 --> 00:56:45.453]  Okay, so we played video clips earlier of police indicating that they wouldn't treat it as a racially motivated crime.
[00:56:45.853 --> 00:56:47.333]  Now we have confirmation of that.
[00:56:48.345 --> 00:56:49.326]  New York Daily News.
[00:56:49.786 --> 00:56:53.348]  Four black suspects who tortured a mentally disabled white teen on Facebook Live.
[00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:57.191]  Video threatened him with a knife and forced him to drink water from a toilet.
[00:56:57.651 --> 00:57:02.555]  But police claim he was targeted because of his special needs, not because of his race.
[00:57:02.975 --> 00:57:06.637]  Well, number one, we read Chicago hate crime law.
[00:57:06.917 --> 00:57:12.801]  A person commits a hate crime when they assault someone by reason of mental disability.
[00:57:12.941 --> 00:57:17.765]  That is one of the reasons within the law that quantifies it, that qualifies it as a hate crime.
[00:57:18.525 --> 00:57:23.266]  So even if they say he was targeted because of his mental disability, that's a hate crime.
[00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:26.407]  Not gonna weasel out of it that way, either Chicago Police.
[00:57:27.447 --> 00:57:44.192]  But Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday that while the suspects made terrible racist statements, so he admits, he admits that they made racist remarks against white people and the President-elect during the on-camera attack, it does not appear to be racially motivated.
[00:57:44.872 --> 00:57:45.472]  Okay!
[00:57:46.272 --> 00:57:48.193]  So they're yelling F white people.
[00:57:48.554 --> 00:57:54.438]  They're forcing the bound, gagged, beaten victim to say F white people.
[00:57:54.758 --> 00:58:00.362]  They're forcing the bound, gagged and beaten victim to say I love black people.
[00:58:01.723 --> 00:58:03.444]  They're filming it live on Facebook.
[00:58:03.745 --> 00:58:09.869]  They're hurling racial slurs and Chicago police have come out and said that this is not racially motivated.
[00:58:10.229 --> 00:58:11.790]  Give me a break!
[00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:18.281]  I mean, if somebody so much as pulls a hijab, it's a racial hate crime within minutes.
[00:58:19.824 --> 00:58:20.826]  Again, flip it around.
[00:58:21.227 --> 00:58:22.068]  Four black people.
[00:58:23.379 --> 00:58:31.525]  Kidnapping somebody, a black person, yelling F Obama, yelling F black people, making him say, I love white people.
[00:58:31.565 --> 00:58:32.465]  Would it be a hate crime?
[00:58:32.505 --> 00:58:33.106]  Yes, it would.
[00:58:33.186 --> 00:58:37.189]  Within minutes, the media, the police, everybody would say it was a hate crime.
[00:58:37.449 --> 00:58:39.770]  Yet this is not a hate crime.
[00:58:40.091 --> 00:58:44.554]  Again, the institutionalized anti-white racist narrative continues.
[00:58:44.594 --> 00:58:46.555]  We'll be back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:46.975 --> 00:58:47.536]  Don't go away.
[00:58:50.258 --> 00:58:51.899]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:53.726 --> 00:58:59.928]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.348 --> 00:59:06.789]  The brutal torture of a special needs man was live streamed on Facebook as he was bound and gagged in Chicago.
[00:59:07.089 --> 00:59:12.911]  In the video, several people in the apartment that took him could be seen laughing and eating during Tuesday night's attack.
[00:59:13.051 --> 00:59:14.391]  The victim was viciously beaten
[00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:15.611]  ...and had been kidnapped.
[00:59:15.711 --> 00:59:22.533]  Now, at least four of the alleged captors were taken into custody on Wednesday, after their footage began making the rounds on social media.
[00:59:22.653 --> 00:59:30.436]  Now, the footage showed the attackers cutting the victim's hair until his scalp bled, slashing his clothes, and reportedly slapping him as they ashed cigarettes on him.
[00:59:30.576 --> 00:59:33.857]  They also forced him to say, F. Donald Trump, F. white people.
[00:59:34.057 --> 00:59:38.598]  One of the suspects could be her, telling the man in the video, instructing him to denounce Donald Trump.
[00:59:38.698 --> 00:59:40.919]  Now, this was live-streamed for roughly 30 minutes,
[00:59:41.519 --> 00:59:45.741]  One of the captors told the special needs man, kiss the floor with an expletive.
[00:59:45.901 --> 00:59:46.842]  Nobody can help you.
[00:59:47.002 --> 00:59:52.065]  The strange part of this video, later on in it, someone urges the man to say, I love black people.
[00:59:52.225 --> 00:59:56.807]  It should be pointed out that all of his captors were in fact black, and he was a white special needs person.
[00:59:57.047 --> 00:59:59.469]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:07.413]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.698 --> 01:00:22.439]  Big Brother.
[01:00:22.859 --> 01:00:24.100]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.523]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:26.543 --> 01:00:27.984]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:29.345]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:29.886 --> 01:00:34.450]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.837]  It's Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones.
[01:00:41.857 --> 01:00:43.959]  We're going to switch gears in the next segment.
[01:00:43.979 --> 01:00:52.624]  We're going to talk to Tommy Robinson and then we'll get back into this story with the next guest, Lauren Southern, because it's still blowing up all over Twitter.
[01:00:53.245 --> 01:01:04.052]  The brutal torture, abduction and beating of this 18-year-old white man by these four thugs who were yelling racial slurs in his face during the entire
[01:01:04.892 --> 01:01:11.473]  48 hour ordeal, but the police say, but the left says, it has nothing to do with racism.
[01:01:11.633 --> 01:01:11.973]  Okay.
[01:01:12.353 --> 01:01:14.594]  This is absolute insanity.
[01:01:15.154 --> 01:01:24.556]  And then they say it has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter when you've had an entire narrative for over two years that it's acceptable to be racist against white people.
[01:01:24.596 --> 01:01:25.516]  We've played the videos.
[01:01:26.436 --> 01:01:31.037]  Oh, you can't be racist against white people because white people have institutionalized power.
[01:01:32.719 --> 01:01:34.200]  Institutional power, okay.
[01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:50.013]  How much institutional power did an 18-year-old mentally disabled teen have when they were cutting bits out of his scalp, when they were forcing him to drink toilet water, beating him round the face, had a knife to his throat?
[01:01:50.754 --> 01:01:53.956]  Yeah, he had a lot of institutional power at that point, didn't he?
[01:01:54.537 --> 01:02:00.160]  A mental age of a child being absolutely, horrifically tortured and traumatized.
[01:02:00.641 --> 01:02:02.862]  How much institutional power did he have?
[01:02:03.643 --> 01:02:04.643]  But that's what they've said.
[01:02:05.064 --> 01:02:06.525]  For years and years, you've seen it.
[01:02:06.665 --> 01:02:09.507]  MTV News, Francesca Ramsey, all of them.
[01:02:09.847 --> 01:02:12.129]  It's impossible to be racist against white people.
[01:02:12.389 --> 01:02:16.311]  You can't be racist against white people because they have power over you.
[01:02:16.932 --> 01:02:19.794]  Yeah, this 18-year-old kid really had power over them, didn't he?
[01:02:21.274 --> 01:02:26.958]  I mean, go to Twitter on any given day and search for the term, except white people.
[01:02:27.658 --> 01:02:30.420]  It's all, good morning everyone, except white people.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.141]  Good night everyone, except white people.
[01:02:32.342 --> 01:02:34.443]  Merry Christmas everyone, except white people.
[01:02:34.803 --> 01:02:36.765]  Happy New Year's everyone, except white people.
[01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:41.228]  How is it still acceptable to be racist against white people?
[01:02:41.548 --> 01:02:45.430]  Again, the last form of acceptable racism is racism against white people.
[01:02:46.391 --> 01:02:55.059]  Because they've coalesced this phony multiculturalism, this fake diversity agenda around demonising white people.
[01:02:55.279 --> 01:03:08.171]  It has everything to do with politics, it has everything to do with rallying minority groups around this terribly corrosive message, which at the end of the day benefits absolutely nobody.
[01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:12.455]  And we're seeing it again with the massive, massive levels of denial.
[01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:16.257]  Over this racially motivated hate crime attack.
[01:03:16.318 --> 01:03:16.878]  That's what it is.
[01:03:17.178 --> 01:03:17.839]  We have eyes.
[01:03:17.999 --> 01:03:18.960]  We can watch a video.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:25.525]  We can listen to what the assailants are saying as they beat him, as they scalp him, as they abuse him.
[01:03:26.565 --> 01:03:28.627]  They're racially abusing him.
[01:03:28.947 --> 01:03:30.368]  It's racially motivated.
[01:03:30.749 --> 01:03:31.049]  Okay?
[01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:32.990]  You can have more than one motivation.
[01:03:33.431 --> 01:03:35.953]  It could be because he's mentally incapacitated as well.
[01:03:37.059 --> 01:03:38.981]  But, listen to the clip.
[01:03:39.501 --> 01:03:41.242]  It's racially motivated, okay?
[01:03:42.003 --> 01:03:48.969]  In a previous segment, we talked about the CNN contributor, who said this wasn't a hate crime because all they talked about was politics.
[01:03:49.389 --> 01:03:49.929]  Not true.
[01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:59.597]  Well, here she is on a previous clip from CNN, again downplaying a racially motivated violent attack.
[01:03:59.637 --> 01:04:00.218]  Here's the clip.
[01:04:01.001 --> 01:04:04.044]  What I heard is both people on both sides should just cut it all out.
[01:04:04.124 --> 01:04:06.947]  And a hate crime is not the same thing as protesting.
[01:04:06.967 --> 01:04:08.889]  We have to be very deliberate about that.
[01:04:08.909 --> 01:04:12.573]  And what do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[01:04:12.673 --> 01:04:15.175]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please, stop.
[01:04:15.535 --> 01:04:16.076]  Stop it, Carl.
[01:04:16.096 --> 01:04:20.861]  What I say to people that protest is that first of all, apparently there has never been an acceptable- That's not protesting.
[01:04:20.881 --> 01:04:22.122]  Dragging somebody out of their car and-
[01:04:22.262 --> 01:04:24.703]  Pardon me, there has never been an acceptable form of protest.
[01:04:24.723 --> 01:04:26.744]  What I'm saying is I'm calling for people to be peaceful.
[01:04:27.104 --> 01:04:28.324]  I think protesting is a right.
[01:04:28.684 --> 01:04:30.005]  It is what this country was founded on.
[01:04:30.025 --> 01:04:32.005]  We got this country via protest, actually.
[01:04:32.225 --> 01:04:33.606]  But it's never okay to use violence.
[01:04:33.626 --> 01:04:36.367]  But we can't keep calling for people to be peaceful.
[01:04:36.667 --> 01:04:43.469]  We can't call for people to be peaceful when the rhetoric that has been used is not peaceful, when people don't feel peaceful in their homes.
[01:04:43.709 --> 01:04:46.251]  Let me ask, I want to finish with one quick question, Carl.
[01:04:46.271 --> 01:04:48.433]  You've been on as long time as a Donald Trump supporter.
[01:04:48.673 --> 01:04:51.195]  I had an interesting conversation with Randy Evans earlier this hour.
[01:04:51.515 --> 01:04:55.638]  Do you see what you... So there you have the same individual again.
[01:04:55.879 --> 01:04:59.421]  CNN contributor Simone Sanders saying, oh poor white people.
[01:04:59.682 --> 01:05:01.323]  This is a legitimate form of process.
[01:05:01.343 --> 01:05:05.907]  They literally drag a guy out of a car, beat him, drag him away as he's hanging on.
[01:05:06.247 --> 01:05:09.630]  This is the same woman who got up on CNN last night on the...
[01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:15.217]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[01:05:15.377 --> 01:05:22.448]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[01:05:22.688 --> 01:05:25.091]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[01:05:25.532 --> 01:05:31.154]  And I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:42.038]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[01:05:42.218 --> 01:05:42.498]  Boom!
[01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:46.320]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:47.960]  Then, by early 2016,
[01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:53.382]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my 20s.
[01:05:53.402 --> 01:05:54.483]  But the election heated up.
[01:05:54.523 --> 01:05:56.883]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:05:57.003 --> 01:06:06.466]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[01:06:06.486 --> 01:06:07.427]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[01:06:07.607 --> 01:06:11.288]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[01:06:12.108 --> 01:06:18.176]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[01:06:18.216 --> 01:06:19.557]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[01:06:19.617 --> 01:06:23.162]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:31.798]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[01:06:32.158 --> 01:06:38.622]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[01:06:39.023 --> 01:06:39.543]  It's amazing.
[01:06:39.843 --> 01:06:42.225]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[01:06:42.505 --> 01:06:45.206]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:06:45.407 --> 01:06:53.992]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount, it's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie, I ate a candy bar last night,
[01:06:55.441 --> 01:06:58.563]  And quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[01:06:59.004 --> 01:07:00.245]  So I'm eating worse.
[01:07:00.885 --> 01:07:08.270]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[01:07:08.411 --> 01:07:08.931]  It's incredible.
[01:07:09.952 --> 01:07:11.873]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[01:07:12.133 --> 01:07:13.094]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[01:07:13.514 --> 01:07:15.896]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[01:07:16.516 --> 01:07:17.397]  This is an experiment.
[01:07:17.517 --> 01:07:18.258]  Everybody's watching.
[01:07:18.498 --> 01:07:19.339]  We'll see what happens.
[01:07:19.779 --> 01:07:20.619]  This is Part 2.
[01:07:24.755 --> 01:07:25.376]  Well, here we are.
[01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:26.497]  Another week has passed.
[01:07:27.098 --> 01:07:39.191]  If memory serves, I lost 5 pounds the first week, 3 pounds the next, and only 1 pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[01:07:39.231 --> 01:07:41.173]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[01:07:41.633 --> 01:07:42.554]  I've lost a pound.
[01:07:43.075 --> 01:07:44.096]  So we're now up to 9 pounds.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.763]  And I've only got a week and a half left or so until we see what happens in this experiment.
[01:07:49.783 --> 01:07:51.405]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[01:07:51.445 --> 01:07:53.506]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[01:07:54.367 --> 01:07:59.030]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[01:07:59.571 --> 01:08:02.033]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[01:08:02.153 --> 01:08:03.734]  Let's see what happens next week.
[01:08:22.079 --> 01:08:27.229]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:30.014]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:37.495 --> 01:08:41.498]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:41.518 --> 01:08:47.903]  We're going to dip back into that BLM kidnapping story, because it's so huge, in the next hour with our next guest.
[01:08:47.983 --> 01:08:50.825]  But for the moment, we're going to go to Tommy Robinson.
[01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:53.507]  Of course, he's been on the show many times before.
[01:08:53.547 --> 01:08:57.069]  He is an activist and author of Enemy of the State.
[01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:58.170]  Tommy, welcome back.
[01:08:58.871 --> 01:08:59.351]  Thanks, Paul.
[01:08:59.691 --> 01:09:00.132]  Good to be here.
[01:09:01.144 --> 01:09:08.346]  Now we're going to get straight into a story that I talked about yesterday because it's made headlines here in the UK over the past few days.
[01:09:08.946 --> 01:09:11.047]  We're talking about this Lily Allen controversy.
[01:09:11.367 --> 01:09:15.168]  First off, a lot of our American audience won't know who she is.
[01:09:15.208 --> 01:09:20.249]  Just explain who Lily Allen is and how this recent Twitter spat got started.
[01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:27.771]  So Lily Allen is a Z-list pop star and she's from a middle-class background, a wealthy background.
[01:09:27.971 --> 01:09:29.732]  Believes she went to private school throughout her life.
[01:09:30.307 --> 01:09:34.350]  And she tries to sell herself as a pop star of the people, of the working class people.
[01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.251]  She does that with her lyrics, how she acts, how she behaves.
[01:09:38.572 --> 01:09:44.956]  She'd come to light mainly to do with politics, probably three or four months ago, when she travelled out to Calais.
[01:09:45.476 --> 01:09:47.858]  She went to the jungle, which is where all the refugees are.
[01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:54.342]  She cried her eyes out and she apologised to them all on behalf of her country, on behalf of all of us.
[01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:58.753]  She apologised to them and she said she's sorry that we blew their country up.
[01:09:58.913 --> 01:10:01.555]  These men are coming from Syria, a country that we haven't blown up.
[01:10:02.055 --> 01:10:08.919]  A country that's actually being torn in two because of Islam and sectarianism and Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:09.499 --> 01:10:16.603]  But she took it upon herself to apologise on behalf of all of us and do everything she can to get them into our country.
[01:10:16.723 --> 01:10:18.724]  She wants a complete open border policy.
[01:10:20.065 --> 01:10:21.946]  We then, after that, we saw a situation where
[01:10:23.092 --> 01:10:26.695]  So-called child refugees were being brought into the UK.
[01:10:27.315 --> 01:10:34.160]  Now, it's turned out that 474 of these so-called child refugees, some of them were actually as old as 29 and 30 years old.
[01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:40.825]  So that was where she first, there was a big backlash against what she was saying and what she was doing many months ago.
[01:10:40.925 --> 01:10:47.690]  Now, most recently with myself this week, you know, so after the attack in Istanbul,
[01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:50.505]  On New Year's Eve, where 39 people were killed.
[01:10:50.525 --> 01:10:51.765]  They still haven't caught him, have they?
[01:10:51.845 --> 01:11:01.412]  After that attack, Lily Allen went online and she put a headline newspaper story where they called the man who'd done the killing a migrant.
[01:11:02.472 --> 01:11:04.754]  And she said, this was her only comment on the attack.
[01:11:05.034 --> 01:11:09.677]  Nothing about the negativity, nothing about the onslaught, nothing about the 39 people who were dead.
[01:11:09.977 --> 01:11:12.138]  Her comment was racism again.
[01:11:12.219 --> 01:11:14.220]  Look at this racism against the migrants.
[01:11:16.017 --> 01:11:21.459]  She didn't give a damn about all the people that had been brutally slaughtered while partying on New Year's Eve.
[01:11:21.479 --> 01:11:22.720]  That wasn't her main focus.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.302]  Her main focus was being offended over a word, which was true anyway.
[01:11:27.342 --> 01:11:29.243]  I mean, he wasn't Turkish, he was a migrant.
[01:11:29.563 --> 01:11:31.404]  She didn't give a damn about any of the victims.
[01:11:31.444 --> 01:11:32.664]  That was her main focus.
[01:11:33.385 --> 01:11:36.326]  That was her main focus, and at that point then, that's what I said.
[01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:40.368]  And she hadn't even read the article, because the article actually told you that they knew he wasn't Turkish.
[01:11:40.768 --> 01:11:42.589]  They knew he was a migrant.
[01:11:42.889 --> 01:11:43.249]  But again,
[01:11:44.153 --> 01:11:48.096]  It's the usual virtue signalling from someone of a celebrity status.
[01:11:48.356 --> 01:11:58.323]  I've had it over the last, probably three months, I've had it with Piers Morgan, Gary Lineker, now Lily Allen, who, when you get into the debate with them, they can't debate.
[01:11:58.883 --> 01:12:10.051]  They literally, every, all three of those people have just called me a racist on their public profile, and then when I've gone into the argument with them to back up how I'm racist, what I've said that's racist, they block you.
[01:12:10.512 --> 01:12:13.354]  Lily Allen, now, she says she's,
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:18.476]  I'll be hearing from her solicitors, because she lost last week.
[01:12:19.713 --> 01:12:23.114]  She lost, uh, because she lost the argument with you on Twitter.
[01:12:23.475 --> 01:12:28.016]  And they, they seem to have missed the last, like, three or four years of discourse.
[01:12:28.357 --> 01:12:40.221]  The fact that calling somebody a racist or a bigot no longer constitutes an argument, not that it ever did, but we've now kind of established that after four or five years of consistently saying it, they still don't get that.
[01:12:40.281 --> 01:12:41.662]  Same thing with Gary Lineker.
[01:12:41.922 --> 01:12:43.002]  He doesn't have an argument.
[01:12:43.383 --> 01:12:48.525]  So she comes out, tries to pick this fight with you, loses the argument blatantly on Twitter.
[01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:48.985]  I saw it.
[01:12:49.565 --> 01:13:10.610]  And her response to losing the argument is to threaten legal action, because she came out and said, oh, the migrant molestation crisis, which has happened in numerous major cities, cases, individual cases, mass cases, almost on a weekly basis now, she says that basically that's not a thing, because she's never been molested by a migrant.
[01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:14.011]  So that's like me saying, oh, I've never had cancer.
[01:13:14.844 --> 01:13:16.125]  Let's not worry about cancer.
[01:13:16.365 --> 01:13:18.485]  And in fact, does cancer even exist?
[01:13:18.866 --> 01:13:20.626]  I mean, how ridiculous is that argument?
[01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:23.007]  Well, it's ridiculous, and you're right.
[01:13:23.027 --> 01:13:27.069]  See, they're not aware that over the last three or four years, things have changed.
[01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:28.429]  Thankfully, they've changed.
[01:13:28.469 --> 01:13:29.270]  They're starting to change.
[01:13:30.492 --> 01:13:34.216]  For 15, 20 years they've been able to silence people with this exact tactic.
[01:13:34.536 --> 01:13:44.527]  Every celebrity, everyone at the high end of the UK has been able to shut the working class people down with this racist dick and beat them back into their box.
[01:13:45.027 --> 01:13:46.149]  That's sort of broke through now.
[01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:50.053]  You can see by any comment, as soon as Gary Lineker did it, or Piers Morgan,
[01:13:50.715 --> 01:13:51.295]  Or Lily Allen.
[01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:53.977]  They were bombarded by the general public.
[01:13:54.377 --> 01:14:01.220]  They come under fierce attack by the general public who are telling them, we've had enough of this, of trying to silence people with this tactic.
[01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:10.121]  And the thing with Lily Allen, why it gets me is Lily Allen, Gary Lineker, if you ever look where Gary Lineker lives, he lives in a multi-million pound mansion.
[01:14:10.361 --> 01:14:12.723]  Lily Allen lived in a 4.2 million pound house.
[01:14:13.143 --> 01:14:15.465]  The house that she chose to buy was in the Cotswolds.
[01:14:15.866 --> 01:14:23.751]  So she didn't choose to buy a house in a multicultural or diverse community where her children would mix with all the cultures which she's welcoming in.
[01:14:24.272 --> 01:14:27.474]  She chose to buy a house in a completely exclusively white community.
[01:14:27.954 --> 01:14:28.875]  So did Gary Lineker.
[01:14:29.255 --> 01:14:31.197]  Gary Lineker's children go to a private school.
[01:14:31.804 --> 01:14:40.731]  All of the people they want to invite into our country, whether that affects waiting time in hospitals, it will affect our waiting time in hospital, they'll go private.
[01:14:41.271 --> 01:14:54.081]  Whether it affects whether our kids get to go to the most local school, because the schools are all completely full now because there's no more schooling places because we keep bringing more and more people in who want to have five, six, seven and eight children, that won't affect them either because their children will be in a private school.
[01:14:54.688 --> 01:15:06.154]  All the issues that will, all the negative impacts that will break down, whether it be little things like that, or whether it be Muslim raping and grooming gangs in our country, whether it be living side by side with terrorists.
[01:15:06.255 --> 01:15:08.056]  I'll talk about Luton again, where I'm from.
[01:15:08.516 --> 01:15:10.657]  The Stockholm bomber left three doors up for my auntie.
[01:15:11.077 --> 01:15:14.539]  The most recent one where they were planning to shoot the American soldier dead.
[01:15:14.959 --> 01:15:16.020]  He lived near my cousin.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.741]  We live with these people.
[01:15:18.811 --> 01:15:23.654]  Apparently, Tommy, Luton is the most desirable place to live in Britain, I recently read.
[01:15:23.674 --> 01:15:24.594]  Isn't that the case?
[01:15:25.975 --> 01:15:27.196]  I saw that, I saw that.
[01:15:27.376 --> 01:15:28.096]  And do you know what?
[01:15:28.317 --> 01:15:29.397]  Do you know why that's so funny?
[01:15:29.677 --> 01:15:32.499]  Because out of my generation, there's not one person left.
[01:15:33.079 --> 01:15:38.022]  So I'm watching as everybody is running from the town.
[01:15:38.846 --> 01:15:39.446]  Everyone's running.
[01:15:39.766 --> 01:15:46.688]  And the only people buying the properties, when they're talking about this property boom, my friend, a builder I know, just bought 40, built 40 flats in the town.
[01:15:47.048 --> 01:15:48.009]  All sold straight away.
[01:15:48.089 --> 01:15:50.109]  Investors, investors, investors, investors.
[01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:53.730]  Luton is selling to investors at an uncontrollable rate.
[01:15:53.771 --> 01:15:57.152]  The prices are rocking up in Luton because it's only 22 minutes on the train.
[01:15:57.512 --> 01:16:01.873]  So for a rental market, you go into entire communities now when no one owns a house.
[01:16:02.415 --> 01:16:03.055]  They're all rentals.
[01:16:03.315 --> 01:16:03.916]  They're all rentals.
[01:16:04.196 --> 01:16:08.557]  And then the council will get the rental contract and they'll put more immigrants in them and more immigrants in them.
[01:16:08.878 --> 01:16:09.858]  And that's what we're witnessing.
[01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:14.460]  So when it comes to the most desirable place to live, everyone is packing their bags and running away from Luton.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:19.722]  And if everyone's honest as to why they're doing it, there's one reason why they're doing it, and that's because of the Islamic takeover of the town.
[01:16:20.502 --> 01:16:25.127]  And it's, I mean, you mentioned earlier Lineker, Lily Allen living in all these white places.
[01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:27.209]  This, it's the same in any European country.
[01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:35.237]  The most vehement, strident advocates for mass immigration, whether it's politicians or celebrities, always live in the whitest areas possible.
[01:16:35.277 --> 01:16:38.380]  And it's the same with the recent Richmond by-election.
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.882]  Of course, they accused everyone, you know, Brexit supporters of being horrible racists.
[01:16:43.262 --> 01:16:46.524]  These are the people who live in the whitest area of London.
[01:16:46.944 --> 01:16:48.966]  It's nothing but virtue signalling.
[01:16:49.186 --> 01:16:53.968]  They don't have to live amongst people who are impacted by mass immigration.
[01:16:54.008 --> 01:16:55.269]  They're never affected by it.
[01:16:55.609 --> 01:17:01.372]  Most of them only voted to remain so they could keep their cheap labour cleaners and personal help.
[01:17:01.752 --> 01:17:03.333]  I mean, these people are complete hypocrites.
[01:17:03.754 --> 01:17:06.115]  And again, as he said, it's virtue signalling.
[01:17:06.335 --> 01:17:07.516]  But with Lily Allen, I mean,
[01:17:08.496 --> 01:17:14.737]  Have you actually received anything legally that suggests she's going to proceed with this ridiculous argument through the courts?
[01:17:15.778 --> 01:17:17.078]  No, not yet, not yet.
[01:17:17.678 --> 01:17:22.419]  And the maddest thing is, when you go through all of our conversation, I didn't say anything that would have been illegal.
[01:17:22.839 --> 01:17:25.820]  She called me a racist, a sexist.
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.481]  She slandered me many times.
[01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:29.481]  I didn't slander her once.
[01:17:29.932 --> 01:17:32.155]  All I've done was question the legitimacy over what she was saying.
[01:17:32.595 --> 01:17:34.697]  And I asked her for evidence and to back it up.
[01:17:35.058 --> 01:17:41.685]  And one thing I did, which I did to her, which I do to everybody, is I asked her to come and spend some time in Luton with me.
[01:17:42.206 --> 01:17:43.187]  And let me take her around.
[01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:52.327]  I could take her to families who would sit there in front of her and the horror stories she would hear would be far worse than what she's heard in Calais.
[01:17:52.827 --> 01:17:57.171]  With regards to their daughters, their sons, how they have to live, the fear they're living in.
[01:17:57.591 --> 01:18:05.658]  So I tried to ask her that and also one of the people I'd have loved to have met was when I was 10 or 11 years old when the Bosnian conflict was on.
[01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:11.231]  We had the first refugees come to Luton and they actually moved in a family.
[01:18:11.251 --> 01:18:14.794]  It was a son, a daughter and their mother because their father was killed in Bosnia.
[01:18:15.214 --> 01:18:16.656]  They moved in on the same road as me.
[01:18:16.976 --> 01:18:18.037]  I've become friends with the boy.
[01:18:18.077 --> 01:18:19.458]  I still know the lad now.
[01:18:19.979 --> 01:18:22.901]  Now, they were real refugees.
[01:18:23.302 --> 01:18:24.363]  They were real refugees.
[01:18:24.383 --> 01:18:25.644]  They've embraced our country.
[01:18:26.141 --> 01:18:30.784]  They've got great careers, both the son and the daughter, and they've become a great example.
[01:18:30.804 --> 01:18:33.745]  And if you look at our country, you'd feel proud of what our country's done for them.
[01:18:34.326 --> 01:18:38.128]  Now, we're not saying we don't want refugees out of hatred in our hearts.
[01:18:38.615 --> 01:18:42.678]  That, what happened then, is completely different to this invasion.
[01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.459]  It's completely different.
[01:18:44.479 --> 01:18:46.641]  Well, it's the same with, um, Sikhs.
[01:18:46.741 --> 01:18:52.705]  I mean, Sikhs are hated by a lot of the Islamists because, generally speaking, they do integrate.
[01:18:52.805 --> 01:18:56.788]  They, you know, have bunting and Union Jack flags outside their celebrations.
[01:18:57.488 --> 01:18:59.310]  52% of Sikhs voted for Brexit.
[01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:02.892]  So it's not about blanket opposition to any immigration whatsoever.
[01:19:03.332 --> 01:19:08.156]  It's about importing this hostile ideology that just doesn't fit with our culture.
[01:19:09.673 --> 01:19:12.895]  And that's what I'd like to anyone of these people, I'd say, come and spend some time in Luton with me.
[01:19:13.455 --> 01:19:14.496]  And you'd meet real people.
[01:19:15.416 --> 01:19:18.498]  And you'd get beyond your idea that you're pushing.
[01:19:18.618 --> 01:19:21.399]  Because in towns like Luton, Luton voted for Brexit.
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:22.540]  Which shocked me.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.101]  Leicester voted for Brexit.
[01:19:24.361 --> 01:19:28.083]  All the towns that are hugely affected by immigration voted for Brexit.
[01:19:28.823 --> 01:19:29.063]  All of them.
[01:19:29.423 --> 01:19:36.367]  Which must mean that literally, when I look at the voting in Luton, I must think that literally every single non-Muslim resident must have voted for Brexit.
[01:19:37.119 --> 01:19:37.420]  Must've.
[01:19:38.562 --> 01:19:43.350]  But yeah, Lily Allen and all these people, and they're being exposed for what they are, I hope she does take me to court.
[01:19:43.691 --> 01:19:46.015]  Lily, if you're watching this, are you in court?
[01:19:48.011 --> 01:19:52.956]  This idea, I mean, now if you tag someone on Twitter, they treat that as harassment.
[01:19:52.976 --> 01:19:59.642]  They're taking it one step further, saying that now disagreeing with them is somehow a hate crime and they're going to take you to court over it.
[01:19:59.782 --> 01:20:03.125]  We'll be back after the next segment with Tommy Robinson.
[01:20:03.145 --> 01:20:05.527]  We're going to talk about the real housewives of ISIS.
[01:20:05.647 --> 01:20:06.928]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:20:07.348 --> 01:20:07.749]  Stay tuned.
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:23.445]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[01:20:24.485 --> 01:20:26.286]  And so I get questions all the time over the years.
[01:20:27.067 --> 01:20:32.810]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:34.150]  And it's simple.
[01:20:34.751 --> 01:20:39.854]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:41.334]  And there's a nexus point.
[01:20:41.374 --> 01:20:44.176]  There's quality versus price.
[01:20:44.216 --> 01:20:46.117]  And those two points have to come together.
[01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:59.685]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[01:21:01.064 --> 01:21:03.126]  The true next generation in body armor.
[01:21:04.027 --> 01:21:11.015]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[01:21:11.816 --> 01:21:14.599]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[01:21:14.619 --> 01:21:17.041]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:21.086]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[01:21:21.526 --> 01:21:22.327]  Well, believe me,
[01:21:23.408 --> 01:21:26.089]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:37.091]  Basically what we're bringing to the Infowars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[01:21:37.731 --> 01:21:39.351]  It's nanotube technology.
[01:21:39.951 --> 01:21:41.471]  It's created here in Texas.
[01:21:42.112 --> 01:21:49.153]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[01:21:49.933 --> 01:21:52.295]  We went out and did some testing.
[01:21:52.716 --> 01:21:55.058]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[01:21:55.078 --> 01:22:01.544]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[01:22:01.784 --> 01:22:15.076]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[01:22:15.436 --> 01:22:20.400]  Born in Texas, made in America, exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.260]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.261]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[01:22:22.621 --> 01:22:25.724]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable.
[01:22:25.784 --> 01:22:26.584]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[01:22:26.624 --> 01:22:28.926]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[01:22:29.386 --> 01:22:36.992]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[01:22:37.692 --> 01:22:41.356]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[01:22:41.376 --> 01:22:48.203]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[01:22:48.223 --> 01:22:49.544]  What did they really say about this?
[01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:50.585]  No, this is through the roof.
[01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:53.508]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[01:22:54.348 --> 01:22:58.130]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[01:22:58.250 --> 01:23:02.332]  Because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[01:23:02.812 --> 01:23:07.795]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[01:23:07.935 --> 01:23:13.378]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in the face of a crime, at least like 94.
[01:23:14.278 --> 01:23:15.339]  Is pistols or shotguns.
[01:23:15.359 --> 01:23:16.599]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.160]  I mean, that's amazing.
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:21.442]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[01:23:21.682 --> 01:23:22.963]  And soon, they won't have it.
[01:23:23.323 --> 01:23:27.725]  If it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's unstoppable.
[01:23:27.885 --> 01:23:31.947]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[01:23:32.748 --> 01:23:36.070]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.890]  People didn't believe in it.
[01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:38.191]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[01:23:38.251 --> 01:23:39.892]  I feed my horse hay.
[01:23:41.312 --> 01:23:43.414]  The Backpack Body Armor is only $200.
[01:23:44.334 --> 01:23:48.517]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[01:23:49.778 --> 01:23:51.699]  Again, fund the InfoWars.
[01:23:51.819 --> 01:23:55.722]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[01:23:56.222 --> 01:23:58.264]  It's a win-win.
[01:23:58.584 --> 01:23:58.264]  $200.
[01:23:58.824 --> 01:24:01.786]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:01.886 --> 01:24:02.566]  It's amazing.
[01:24:10.569 --> 01:24:11.053]  Yeah.
[01:24:22.245 --> 01:24:23.605]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:26.226]  We're going to go back to our guest Tommy Robinson here in a moment.
[01:24:26.306 --> 01:24:31.368]  First, we're under attack constantly day by day from the mainstream media, from the establishment.
[01:24:31.688 --> 01:24:34.128]  We remain independent for a reason.
[01:24:34.168 --> 01:24:36.869]  That reason is your support buying the products.
[01:24:36.909 --> 01:24:43.891]  That's why we're proud to announce this new discount which is the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[01:24:44.511 --> 01:24:52.416]  Again, we're continuing many of the discounts on the great five-star reviewed products, independent reviews at Infowarslife.com.
[01:24:52.797 --> 01:24:55.258]  They include BrainForce, which I've got right here.
[01:24:55.739 --> 01:24:57.260]  Popped two of these before the show.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.562]  Again, this is a fantastic cognitive enhancer.
[01:25:01.082 --> 01:25:02.844]  Also good for social situations.
[01:25:03.644 --> 01:25:10.671]  Leading Edge Newtropic, Google Newtropic, find out why all the Silicon Valley whiz kids are taking Newtropics.
[01:25:10.931 --> 01:25:16.397]  And Brain Force is now 30% off at infowarslife.com.
[01:25:16.417 --> 01:25:18.519]  We've got Secret 12, 20% off.
[01:25:18.559 --> 01:25:19.800]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[01:25:20.601 --> 01:25:24.185]  Knockout, which is the Sleep Aid, which is popular amongst a lot of people, 20% off.
[01:25:26.055 --> 01:25:28.416]  And many others at Infowarslife.com.
[01:25:28.896 --> 01:25:30.816]  Again, we're able to remain independent.
[01:25:31.296 --> 01:25:32.517]  I'm not told what to say.
[01:25:32.537 --> 01:25:35.218]  I can have any guest on I want.
[01:25:35.818 --> 01:25:47.001]  I get complete autonomy, complete independence, because we're not controlled by CNN, for example, which has, you know, Gulf state dictators like Bahrain funding their programming.
[01:25:47.341 --> 01:25:50.062]  So they put out puff pieces about how great the
[01:25:50.882 --> 01:25:53.064]  Islamist dictatorship of Bahrain is.
[01:25:53.124 --> 01:25:54.084]  We don't have to do that.
[01:25:54.504 --> 01:25:57.747]  We don't have to take money from George Soros like Black Lives Matter does.
[01:25:58.167 --> 01:26:01.489]  We don't have to push trash pharmaceuticals that kill you.
[01:26:02.210 --> 01:26:03.350]  Because we're independent.
[01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:04.811]  We're self-funded.
[01:26:05.312 --> 01:26:07.033]  Because we sell our own products.
[01:26:07.113 --> 01:26:08.234]  God forbid the horror.
[01:26:08.954 --> 01:26:14.438]  So, that's how you support us, that's why we're still here, that's how we thrived all these years later.
[01:26:14.778 --> 01:26:28.807]  From a tiny operation that started off with just a handful of people, to now we're still relatively modest, but we're sizable enough to pose a massive threat to the daily narratives, the lying, deceptive, mainstream media.
[01:26:28.847 --> 01:26:31.449]  That's why they hate us, that's why they constantly attack us.
[01:26:31.789 --> 01:26:36.593]  Couldn't have done any of that without your support, getting the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:40.294]  Take advantage of the auto-reorder option as well.
[01:26:40.914 --> 01:26:44.495]  Again, massive discounts at infowarslife.com.
[01:26:45.475 --> 01:26:47.275]  Going back to our guest, Tommy Robinson.
[01:26:47.576 --> 01:26:49.576]  He is author of Enemy of the State.
[01:26:50.436 --> 01:26:59.739]  Tommy, the BBC reports that a man who placed bacon on the doors of a Bristol mosque has died in prison, this was about a week ago now, while serving a 12-month sentence.
[01:26:59.779 --> 01:27:01.319]  His name is Kevin Crean.
[01:27:02.079 --> 01:27:03.620]  They're saying it's not suspicious.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:05.260]  What's the latest on this story?
[01:27:06.775 --> 01:27:12.838]  He, so, he was sentenced to 12 months as you've said, he put bacon on a door handle.
[01:27:13.458 --> 01:27:25.283]  I get hugely, when I think about this case, obviously you know I've been in custody many times over the last seven years, six years, and he would have been so worried, so scared, so intimidated.
[01:27:27.352 --> 01:27:29.633]  The crime doesn't fit the punishment at all.
[01:27:29.894 --> 01:27:31.475]  It just doesn't fit.
[01:27:31.895 --> 01:27:36.137]  He was used as a scapegoat to install fear into everybody else.
[01:27:36.638 --> 01:27:40.300]  Now, put it back on a Moss store handle, pretty stupid thing to have done.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.761]  Pretty stupid thing to have done.
[01:27:42.221 --> 01:27:43.342]  Does it warrant a year in jail?
[01:27:43.882 --> 01:27:52.387]  Especially when we compare it, the same judge that sentenced him to 12 months in jail only sentenced a Somalian to 24 months in jail for raping a young English kid.
[01:27:54.164 --> 01:28:05.867]  This case specifically, and specifically because some of your viewers, if you don't understand what it's like in the British prisons, just briefly, British prisons are now like ISIS training camps.
[01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:12.269]  When you get in there, the main gang, the only gang in control of everything is the Islamic gang.
[01:28:13.362 --> 01:28:18.906]  And they're radicalising, they're recruiting, and they're enforcing Sharia with violence.
[01:28:19.366 --> 01:28:23.508]  They're taking Jizya money, they're taking tax money off non-Muslims to stay safe.
[01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:31.413]  You have to really, until I went into prison, I don't think people on the outside can quite really understand just how bad it is in there.
[01:28:32.048 --> 01:28:42.151]  So having been in there and knowing that this man has been sentenced for something that would be seen as against Islam, I know the fear he would have faced and the gangs that would have wanted to target him.
[01:28:42.611 --> 01:28:44.152]  Now yes, he has been found dead.
[01:28:44.772 --> 01:28:53.795]  The point I make is, whether that was him being murdered, whether he killed himself, whether he got addicted to drugs, because another thing, in our prison system,
[01:28:54.651 --> 01:28:56.635]  You should only send people there if it's going to benefit.
[01:28:56.936 --> 01:28:59.541]  If it's going to be some sort of rehabilitation to them.
[01:28:59.861 --> 01:29:02.186]  Because our prison system doesn't attempt to rehabilitate you.
[01:29:02.745 --> 01:29:03.946]  It doesn't attempt to do anything.
[01:29:04.206 --> 01:29:05.267]  It's full of drugs.
[01:29:05.727 --> 01:29:06.688]  It's full of violence.
[01:29:07.068 --> 01:29:09.190]  Now, this man's crime just didn't fit that.
[01:29:09.490 --> 01:29:10.731]  It doesn't fit a warrant now.
[01:29:11.311 --> 01:29:19.157]  So whether he's gone to prison... I know men myself, who have grown up living in Luton, who have gone into prison complete clean, never taken drugs.
[01:29:19.517 --> 01:29:21.319]  They've come out drug addicts and heroin addicts.
[01:29:21.879 --> 01:29:22.520]  From prison.
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:28.064]  And when people are at their weakest and at their lowest, they're easy prey and they're vulnerable.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:30.861]  And I'm still outraged.
[01:29:30.881 --> 01:29:32.802]  I know he's getting buried next week.
[01:29:33.103 --> 01:29:34.784]  I've had contact with his family.
[01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:40.167]  The judge and this decision against this, something should be done about it.
[01:29:40.607 --> 01:29:44.029]  There was another case recently in London where two Polish men shouted abuse at a mosque.
[01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:45.932]  No, no, they were remanded.
[01:29:45.972 --> 01:29:48.113]  They were remanded in prison straight away.
[01:29:48.173 --> 01:29:48.613]  No bail.
[01:29:48.713 --> 01:29:49.273]  They were remanded.
[01:29:49.633 --> 01:29:52.554]  By the time they got to their court case, they'd both been... Tommy, hold that thought.
[01:29:52.574 --> 01:29:54.575]  We'll talk about that case after the break.
[01:29:54.715 --> 01:29:55.635]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:55.735 --> 01:29:57.696]  Alex Jones Show, live breaking news, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:57.716 --> 01:29:58.876]  Don't go away.
[01:29:59.076 --> 01:29:59.956]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.456 --> 01:30:02.057]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:05.678]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:15.844]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[01:30:15.864 --> 01:30:17.808]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.582]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[01:30:21.202 --> 01:30:26.767]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[01:30:27.347 --> 01:30:35.354]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[01:30:35.774 --> 01:30:37.815]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[01:30:38.116 --> 01:30:39.317]  This is the best system out there.
[01:30:39.577 --> 01:30:42.339]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[01:30:42.579 --> 01:30:43.320]  This is how it works.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:44.141]  You order.
[01:30:44.261 --> 01:30:45.061]  Customized or
[01:30:46.142 --> 01:30:55.611]  Straight from the factory, however you want it, it is shipped on the next business day to you and your family, and a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[01:30:55.812 --> 01:30:56.612]  You cannot lose.
[01:30:56.632 --> 01:30:57.734]  You're funding the Infowar.
[01:30:58.014 --> 01:31:04.780]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[01:31:05.101 --> 01:31:09.065]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[01:31:09.867 --> 01:31:18.871]  We have an article that's up on our website, written by Clifford Cunningham, and it talks about how the Communist Chinese government is moving against Trump, asserting control over strategic ports.
[01:31:19.071 --> 01:31:29.075]  Now, the state-controlled corporations are masquerading as private entities, and they're accelerating their plan to acquire control over deep water ports and major shipping lanes across the world.
[01:31:29.355 --> 01:31:42.184]  The Sri Lankan government, heavily indebted to China, recently agreed to lease approximately 80% of a strategic port in the southern part of the country to the Chinese government, a company masquerading as private for $1.1 billion.
[01:31:42.364 --> 01:31:52.892]  Now the port lies along an important trade route connecting Asia to the Middle East, and it's a key part of the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road plan to expand Chinese control over key shipping lanes.
[01:31:53.032 --> 01:32:01.979]  All of this news comes as President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to take a stronger stance with China and trade, specifically when it comes to imports.
[01:32:02.119 --> 01:32:05.682]  It looks like they're moving ahead of the game and salvaging whatever they can.
[01:32:05.702 --> 01:32:08.545]  I'm Margaret Halver reporting for InfoWars.com.

[01:33:19.798 --> 01:33:22.462]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:22.502 --> 01:33:27.608]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:32.842 --> 01:33:34.363]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:34.403 --> 01:33:37.125]  We're going to go back to Tommy Robinson here in a second.
[01:33:37.165 --> 01:33:38.266]  First, a bit of breaking news.
[01:33:38.706 --> 01:33:47.473]  We were talking about the attack on the 18-year-old mentally disabled teen by people yelling, F white people, F Donald Trump there in Chicago.
[01:33:48.033 --> 01:33:51.536]  Now, according to Matt Finn of Fox News, I believe,
[01:33:52.276 --> 01:33:58.721]  The public pressure has led to those four attackers being charged with hate crimes in Chicago.
[01:33:58.741 --> 01:34:05.705]  Of course, the police indicated they wouldn't be charged with hate crimes, or maybe not at least racially motivated hate crimes.
[01:34:06.506 --> 01:34:08.788]  We'll wait and see what the exact hate crime is.
[01:34:08.848 --> 01:34:13.111]  It could be related to mental disability, because as I read out the law earlier, that is in the law.
[01:34:13.891 --> 01:34:17.574]  But no doubt, public pressure has led to this decision.
[01:34:17.974 --> 01:34:24.819]  Again, the four African-American attackers in that Facebook torture video, all charged with hate crimes in Chicago.
[01:34:25.239 --> 01:34:26.701]  And that is the right decision.
[01:34:26.821 --> 01:34:29.262]  It would be the right decision if the roles were reversed.
[01:34:29.643 --> 01:34:38.990]  If it was four white people yelling, F black people, F Obama, while torturing a mentally disabled 18-year-old black kid, that would also be a hate crime.
[01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:40.411]  So, right decision there.
[01:34:40.851 --> 01:34:43.932]  I'm going to go back to Tommy Robinson, he is author of Enemy of the State.
[01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:52.534]  Most people don't know, Tommy, there's a huge Muslim prison population, not just in the United Kingdom, but basically in every major European country.
[01:34:52.994 --> 01:35:00.696]  We're talking about Belgium, they've got a 6% Muslim population, a 45% prison population, Muslim males.
[01:35:01.356 --> 01:35:04.617]  France has a Muslim population of 6-10%.
[01:35:05.017 --> 01:35:07.498]  They have a prison population of 70% Muslims.
[01:35:09.418 --> 01:35:14.780]  Spain has a Muslim population of 3.7% and a prison population which comprises 70%.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:17.960]  That's 17, not 17.
[01:35:18.601 --> 01:35:30.544]  So, finish up your comments with Kevin Crean, but also, you know, given that we're told Islam is this religion that teaches young men to be pious and disciplined, why do so many of them end up in prison?
[01:35:31.424 --> 01:35:37.206]  Well, the other thing is we're completely losing a war which many people don't even understand is being fought.
[01:35:38.453 --> 01:35:41.815]  Whoever controls the streets, controls the town.
[01:35:42.856 --> 01:35:47.678]  So I've watched through my years as a youngster in my hometown of Luton, you'll have some very rough estates.
[01:35:48.379 --> 01:35:55.703]  You have a rough estate where there would be a fight back against the Islamisation, against the herring gangs, against the sexual exploitation.
[01:35:56.243 --> 01:35:59.305]  In this predominantly white and black estate, they would fight back.
[01:36:00.045 --> 01:36:06.489]  What then happens is the most prominent gang members end up in prison from these estates, which aren't Muslim, they're white and black.
[01:36:07.352 --> 01:36:11.276]  Then when they're in prison, they radicalise, they convert.
[01:36:11.557 --> 01:36:13.479]  I mean everyone converts, you don't understand.
[01:36:13.499 --> 01:36:18.164]  Like no one really understands the scope of the problem unless they go there and see what's happening.
[01:36:18.925 --> 01:36:20.066]  Everyone is converting.
[01:36:20.547 --> 01:36:27.715]  So now, the difference we're at now to 10 years ago in Luton, is all the young gang members, even in the non-Muslim areas,
[01:36:28.436 --> 01:36:29.196]  are now Muslim.
[01:36:29.596 --> 01:36:34.718]  They're white, they're black, they're converted, they're part of this one of a month, this one big gang.
[01:36:35.159 --> 01:36:39.840]  And then the resistance in those estates to tackle and stop what was happening is gone!
[01:36:40.681 --> 01:36:41.041]  It's gone!
[01:36:41.701 --> 01:36:45.382]  And people don't even understand the concept of this is organised.
[01:36:45.723 --> 01:36:49.784]  This prison radicalisation, this prison conversion, all of these things are organised.
[01:36:50.004 --> 01:36:51.005]  There's actually a price.
[01:36:51.385 --> 01:36:54.786]  If Muslims convert a prisoner in jail, they get sent money into them.
[01:36:55.302 --> 01:36:56.143]  They get sent money in.
[01:36:56.503 --> 01:37:02.108]  And the level of, and the scope of the problem in the prison, I was in a maximum security prison called Woodhill.
[01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:05.211]  Woodhill houses some of the country's most feared terrorists.
[01:37:06.112 --> 01:37:11.376]  Now, a non-Muslim had been in an altercation in a jail in the other end of England, yeah?
[01:37:11.937 --> 01:37:15.500]  He'd been transferred out for his own safety because he was going to get violently attacked.
[01:37:16.361 --> 01:37:19.544]  Now, literally, the next morning he walked into this prison in Woodhill.
[01:37:20.151 --> 01:37:22.514]  And within seconds he was violently stabbed.
[01:37:23.095 --> 01:37:33.608]  Now the prison officer said, the prison guard, the officer said, the only way that message could have got that quickly from there to there is through the Imam.
[01:37:34.465 --> 01:37:40.751]  The only way they could have passed the message to get him for messing with Muslims or messing with Islam was through the Imam.
[01:37:41.251 --> 01:37:42.592]  And the prison authority knew that.
[01:37:42.993 --> 01:37:47.477]  They knew that the Imam is going around telling people, there's a man coming here, he's done this, get him.
[01:37:47.857 --> 01:37:53.983]  And that's happened, I've watched most recently again, and non-Muslims are being fed like lambs to slaughter.
[01:37:54.523 --> 01:37:55.664]  Across our prison system.
[01:37:55.964 --> 01:38:04.028]  And until one of them are brutally murdered and butchered or even beheaded in a prison, that's when people may want to stop and try and start and do something about it.
[01:38:04.488 --> 01:38:13.232]  But most recently, I don't know if you saw the case up in Rotherham, where we had the protesters, where 19 Muslims were arrested and put on trial for attacking a pub.
[01:38:14.164 --> 01:38:22.207]  Well, the 90 Muslims got off because their community come together, every left-wing activist, politician, all of them fought for their defence.
[01:38:22.827 --> 01:38:25.628]  Five non-Muslims were put in jail for exactly the same case.
[01:38:26.008 --> 01:38:27.629]  If you watch the footage, they did nothing.
[01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:28.829]  They got attacked.
[01:38:29.269 --> 01:38:30.890]  They were put in prison for the same case.
[01:38:31.930 --> 01:38:34.871]  I follow every comment and what's going on to see if they're okay.
[01:38:35.231 --> 01:38:36.592]  All of them have been violently beaten.
[01:38:37.071 --> 01:38:38.174]  All of them have come under attack.
[01:38:38.194 --> 01:38:40.039]  And that's happening across our prison system.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.324]  That happened, exactly the same happened with me.
[01:38:42.525 --> 01:38:43.948]  Just handed to them, on a plate.
[01:38:44.468 --> 01:38:46.068]  Hand it to the party, don't you want to?
[01:38:47.249 --> 01:39:03.452]  And that's exactly what, with Kevin Crehan, he should never ever forget, even if he has died, that's the judge's responsibility, but how can we have a man in the UK, how can we have an English man put in prison for 12 months, when if the prisons were safe, then that's not right.
[01:39:03.872 --> 01:39:10.894]  But when the prison system, the authorities, the governors, the politicians, everyone is fully aware of just how bad the problem is with Islam in prison.
[01:39:11.451 --> 01:39:14.672]  And yet still we put this man in there for putting a bit of bacon near a mosque.
[01:39:15.192 --> 01:39:16.012]  It disgusts me.
[01:39:16.292 --> 01:39:24.594]  It's contempt and I'm so outraged that every single person who played their part in that, which mainly is a non-Muslim judge, who's handed him on a plate to them.
[01:39:25.154 --> 01:39:31.475]  Handed him on a plate and my thing that frustrates me about it is I know how terrified he would have been because I was terrified.
[01:39:31.955 --> 01:39:33.396]  So I know the fear he would have had.
[01:39:33.696 --> 01:39:35.096]  I know the fear his mum would have had.
[01:39:35.336 --> 01:39:36.398]  Because my mum had the same.
[01:39:36.418 --> 01:39:38.282]  I know the fear his whole family would have had.
[01:39:38.603 --> 01:39:43.454]  And worrying every night about whether he's going to be okay, whether they're going to get him today, whether today's the day he gets hurt.
[01:39:43.935 --> 01:39:44.616]  And he's ended up dead.
[01:39:46.502 --> 01:39:53.429]  It's absolutely disgraceful and the other thing people don't realise is they call it jihadi cool.
[01:39:53.569 --> 01:40:00.956]  They've kind of merged this black gangster criminality culture with Islamism and you see that now playing out in the prisons.
[01:40:00.996 --> 01:40:09.705]  So that's how they use it to lure young people and all the stats show young people are even more likely to radicalise than older Muslims now.
[01:40:09.745 --> 01:40:10.726]  But we're going to move on.
[01:40:11.226 --> 01:40:13.327]  Coming up this season on The Real Housewives of ISIS.
[01:40:34.292 --> 01:40:35.993]  It's only three days till the beheading.
[01:40:36.293 --> 01:40:38.913]  And I've got no idea what I'm gonna wear.
[01:40:38.993 --> 01:40:40.494]  Abdul seduced me online.
[01:40:40.714 --> 01:40:42.274]  He had me at free healthcare.
[01:40:42.675 --> 01:40:44.155]  So this is my sixth marriage.
[01:40:44.635 --> 01:40:45.815]  I've been widowed five times.
[01:40:49.737 --> 01:40:50.237]  Six times.
[01:40:50.757 --> 01:40:52.938]  I'm so glad I've moved over here.
[01:40:53.118 --> 01:40:55.478]  It's everything those guys on the chat rooms told me it would be.
[01:40:55.578 --> 01:40:57.459]  And it's brought us so many wonderful surprises.
[01:40:57.539 --> 01:40:58.919]  Enough to do your suburbia!
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:40:59.640]  Ah!
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.380]  Bullshit!
[01:41:02.108 --> 01:41:02.932]  Are you ready, girl?
[01:41:03.494 --> 01:41:03.895]  Yeah!
[01:41:04.056 --> 01:41:05.662]  Hang on, I'm recording it for Instagram.
[01:41:08.666 --> 01:41:09.427]  Ta-da!
[01:41:09.947 --> 01:41:10.828]  What do you think?
[01:41:11.428 --> 01:41:13.110]  Alma surprised me with it yesterday.
[01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:14.911]  Hashtag OMG.
[01:41:14.971 --> 01:41:16.272]  Hashtag Jihadi Jane.
[01:41:16.332 --> 01:41:18.434]  Hashtag death to the West Isis emojis.
[01:41:18.674 --> 01:41:19.875]  Oh, babes, I love it.
[01:41:20.235 --> 01:41:21.676]  You look gorgeous.
[01:41:21.776 --> 01:41:23.858]  She looked massive.
[01:41:24.098 --> 01:41:26.841]  You're gonna need a lot of semtex to kill that one.
[01:41:26.861 --> 01:41:28.762]  Aw, guys.
[01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:30.583]  Aileen!
[01:41:30.624 --> 01:41:33.065]  What do you think of this?
[01:41:35.356 --> 01:41:36.217]  Awkward!
[01:41:36.937 --> 01:41:38.478]  What a complete bitch!
[01:41:38.518 --> 01:41:39.819]  She knew I had that jacket!
[01:41:40.479 --> 01:41:41.280]  Copies everything.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:42.660]  Copy this!
[01:41:44.001 --> 01:41:47.103]  Oh my God, it was so cringe.
[01:41:47.123 --> 01:41:49.204]  Hashtag matchy-matchy.
[01:41:49.224 --> 01:41:51.846]  It's times like this I wish I'd never moved out here.
[01:41:52.186 --> 01:41:56.729]  Coming up next week... Come on, stop talking about his 40 virgins!
[01:41:56.769 --> 01:41:58.910]  Why can't he be happy with me?
[01:41:59.430 --> 01:42:03.433]  Er, Ali bought me a new chain, which is eight foot long.
[01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:07.773]  So, I can almost get outside, which is great!
[01:42:13.655 --> 01:42:21.138]  Now, the reaction to that was vociferous, as you would expect from these permanently offended Twitter outrage mobs.
[01:42:21.158 --> 01:42:24.579]  You had leftists, you had Islamists droning on about how offended they were.
[01:42:25.259 --> 01:42:34.563]  Tommy, if Islam has nothing to do with ISIS, as they constantly tell us, why would anyone be offended over someone making fun out of ISIS?
[01:42:35.919 --> 01:42:40.181]  Well, because we know Islam has everything to do with ISIS.
[01:42:40.281 --> 01:42:52.325]  But I've seen some of the comments saying that, yeah, all so-called moderate Muslims getting outraged and offended because someone's mocking an extremist, radical, terrorist organisation.
[01:42:52.886 --> 01:42:53.486]  Insanity.
[01:42:53.866 --> 01:42:56.247]  And that's the thing, we're fair game to be mocked.
[01:42:56.707 --> 01:43:04.470]  Our religion, our culture, our identity, everything about us has been fair game for decades to be ridiculed and abused in any way you want.
[01:43:05.319 --> 01:43:13.225]  Nothing at all to do with Islam has ever been fair game or acceptable to mock or have a laugh about.
[01:43:13.545 --> 01:43:16.627]  And this is one of the first things they've actually done, which is great.
[01:43:17.327 --> 01:43:17.688]  It's good.
[01:43:17.928 --> 01:43:20.089]  And I'm shocked it's the BBC, same as what you said.
[01:43:20.249 --> 01:43:21.910]  I'm shocked by it.
[01:43:22.511 --> 01:43:28.435]  But yeah, the best thing to do with groups like ISIS and to do with Islam is mock it, because it deserves mocking.
[01:43:30.074 --> 01:43:33.258]  I had a tweet that I responded to on Twitter in regard to this.
[01:43:33.819 --> 01:43:37.082]  This was a Muslim woman, full hijab and everything.
[01:43:37.143 --> 01:43:40.867]  She said about this BBC clip, I don't find my religion funny.
[01:43:40.987 --> 01:43:42.869]  I don't find a show mocking it funny either.
[01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:46.434]  ISIS or not, you're still mocking Islam, whether extreme or not.
[01:43:46.974 --> 01:43:54.496]  And Tommy, I basically responded, said, Newsflash, we're still free in the West to mock a belief system without being beheaded.
[01:43:54.896 --> 01:43:57.017]  That's the attitude that they're trying to import.
[01:43:57.037 --> 01:44:01.198]  We saw it with the reaction to Charlie Hebdo, the reaction to the Garland shooting.
[01:44:01.578 --> 01:44:07.880]  They want to import this ideology, which makes it basically a hate crime, to mock a set of beliefs.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.321]  It's akin to saying that you can't make fun out of Scientology.
[01:44:11.621 --> 01:44:14.042]  Because as you said, with regard to the prison radicalization,
[01:44:15.862 --> 01:44:17.883]  Islam is not a race, correct?
[01:44:18.543 --> 01:44:26.707]  They've been very successful in making it, in being able to do this because you actually can't mock it in many places at many times.
[01:44:27.347 --> 01:44:28.767]  As I said, prison system is one of them.
[01:44:28.928 --> 01:44:31.229]  You couldn't say a word against Islam in a prison system, you'd be killed.
[01:44:32.867 --> 01:44:39.989]  The police will come down on you in many terms or find any way to silence you if you begin to try and mock it in a public sphere.
[01:44:40.269 --> 01:44:44.230]  Whether it be Twitter deleting you or suspending you, Facebook closing you down.
[01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:48.491]  They've been quite successful in introducing this sort of blasphemy law.
[01:44:49.011 --> 01:44:52.152]  So when the BBC go and do this, I think it's great that they have done it.
[01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:57.013]  And I think that, as you said, Islam is an idea.
[01:44:57.233 --> 01:44:59.994]  This is what many of our opposition can't get their head around.
[01:45:00.754 --> 01:45:01.514]  It's just an idea.
[01:45:02.082 --> 01:45:03.183]  It's a very bad idea.
[01:45:03.924 --> 01:45:05.445]  It's an idea that you can change your mind.
[01:45:05.485 --> 01:45:06.085]  You can leave it.
[01:45:06.125 --> 01:45:08.948]  Well, you can leave it if you live in one of the Western democracies.
[01:45:09.008 --> 01:45:11.830]  If you live in an Islamic country, you'd be punished by getting killed.
[01:45:13.592 --> 01:45:14.913]  But yes, it's an idea.
[01:45:14.933 --> 01:45:15.573]  It's a bad idea.
[01:45:15.633 --> 01:45:17.095]  It's an idea that we should be
[01:45:18.434 --> 01:45:26.000]  At this moment now, more than ever, ridiculing, looking at and exposing all the negative points of it.
[01:45:26.401 --> 01:45:27.442]  So that people understand it.
[01:45:27.482 --> 01:45:34.848]  The problem we have with so many people, not just non-Muslims, but many Muslims as well, they don't even understand Islam themselves.
[01:45:35.288 --> 01:45:38.671]  They don't understand the terrible deeds and the immoral actions of their Prophet.
[01:45:39.124 --> 01:45:42.605]  They don't understand... I don't think they understand the agenda of Islam.
[01:45:42.726 --> 01:45:44.186]  So many of them are just born Muslim.
[01:45:44.466 --> 01:45:45.487]  I have this through the years.
[01:45:45.787 --> 01:45:48.848]  I meet Muslims all the time, whether it be for debates or interviews or anything.
[01:45:49.208 --> 01:45:52.289]  And I sit and go through things that their prophet did, and they're gobsmacked.
[01:45:52.490 --> 01:45:53.090]  They have no idea!
[01:45:53.749 --> 01:45:54.650]  They had no idea.
[01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:56.931]  So it's just like many Christians before.
[01:45:57.171 --> 01:45:59.313]  Many Christians probably don't know the words of the Bible.
[01:45:59.333 --> 01:46:00.814]  They don't know the full story of Jesus.
[01:46:01.174 --> 01:46:03.595]  Many, many who are born Christian, who are just born into it.
[01:46:03.615 --> 01:46:04.976]  That's the same with Muslims.
[01:46:04.996 --> 01:46:10.140]  And I think the more we expose it, the more they understand, then hopefully the more of them leave.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:18.045]  And to be honest, Paul, I've had this week alone, there was one boy who threatened to kill my family just a number of years ago.
[01:46:18.305 --> 01:46:19.766]  It made the national newspapers in England.
[01:46:20.467 --> 01:46:22.588]  He sent me a big massive essay this last week.
[01:46:23.041 --> 01:46:26.071]  Saying how sorry he is, how he apologises so much.
[01:46:26.092 --> 01:46:27.035]  He was actually a black Muslim.
[01:46:28.672 --> 01:46:32.114]  And he couldn't understand when he started looking into what Mohammed said about black people.
[01:46:32.295 --> 01:46:32.935]  That's what got him.
[01:46:33.335 --> 01:46:34.696]  What Mohammed said about black people.
[01:46:35.036 --> 01:46:38.619]  And he sent me a big massive essay saying he hopes I accept his apology.
[01:46:38.979 --> 01:46:40.320]  He did not understand Islam.
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:42.081]  He didn't understand what his prophet did.
[01:46:42.481 --> 01:46:51.708]  He's now spent the last two years researching, reading the biography of Mohammed by Ibn Ishaq, looking into everything which I'd been telling him to look into online.
[01:46:52.148 --> 01:46:54.069]  And he's now, thankfully, left Islam.
[01:46:55.731 --> 01:47:01.372]  And I think there'll be more and more Muslims that will do that when they understand the true nature and the violent rhetoric of their founder.
[01:47:03.328 --> 01:47:16.315]  And of course one of the other problems that we constantly need to combat is the fact that these left-wing groups like Hope Not Hate list Muslim reformers like Majid Nawaz and Ayaan Hirsi Ali as anti-Muslim bigots.
[01:47:16.395 --> 01:47:29.082]  So in many cases we're up against the big institutionalised foundations that prevent nominal Muslims, Muslims looking to leave the religion, from speaking out against it because then they get a huge target painted on their back.
[01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:32.304]  But we've got a few minutes left here Tommy, I just want to get to a final question.
[01:47:33.444 --> 01:47:35.906]  We didn't see a mass molestation in Cologne.
[01:47:35.926 --> 01:47:39.127]  We didn't see a repeat of it because of the huge police presence.
[01:47:39.167 --> 01:47:42.689]  We did see incidents in Frankfurt, Innsbruck and other European cities.
[01:47:43.089 --> 01:48:01.739]  But what got me was, given what happened in Cologne last year, knowing that there'd be this huge police presence, knowing that they'd be putting themselves at risk of arrest, why on earth did these hundreds of Muslim migrants show up to the very same spot in Cologne once again this year?
[01:48:03.063 --> 01:48:03.804]  Because they don't care.
[01:48:03.824 --> 01:48:06.926]  Because they do not care at all.
[01:48:07.767 --> 01:48:10.249]  They have not one bother in them.
[01:48:10.409 --> 01:48:14.873]  And the truth is, if there wasn't 1,500 police officers at Cologne station, we'd have seen exactly the same.
[01:48:15.093 --> 01:48:15.854]  We all know that now.
[01:48:16.694 --> 01:48:17.775]  The German authorities know that.
[01:48:17.955 --> 01:48:18.676]  The public know that.
[01:48:19.056 --> 01:48:27.263]  If there wasn't, in every single city across Europe, thousands of police officers and military put on duty, we'd have seen huge, huge problems.
[01:48:27.603 --> 01:48:28.224]  Massive problems.
[01:48:28.837 --> 01:48:31.227]  Massive problems across the globe, across Europe.
[01:48:31.969 --> 01:48:33.817]  And again, it comes to point, at what point...
[01:48:34.608 --> 01:48:36.409]  Do we not have enough police to deal with it?
[01:48:36.549 --> 01:48:40.811]  Because each year the problem's going to get worse, as we know, with the invasion that's happening.
[01:48:41.171 --> 01:48:55.436]  The only, where I feel a lot, in a lot better position than we were seven years ago, I feel quite happy, and I can smile about it, because what you've witnessed with the political revolution in America, you witnessed it with Brexit, we know Gert Wilders is going to get in power.
[01:48:56.197 --> 01:49:04.140]  If they manage to stop Le Pen this time, if they do, because what I can't believe is what they do with her election is, when she wins, the other parties will all drop out.
[01:49:04.625 --> 01:49:07.207]  So that they'll all conspire to vote for the one against Le Pen.
[01:49:07.788 --> 01:49:10.590]  Now that ain't democracy anyway, that's not democracy.
[01:49:10.610 --> 01:49:14.793]  But whether they are successful again this year in doing that, in four years' time they won't.
[01:49:15.153 --> 01:49:20.338]  There's a political revolution underway and I'll sit there happy knowing that we're on the right side of it.
[01:49:20.478 --> 01:49:28.004]  And there's nothing that any of the left-wing groups, there's nothing that the people funding CNN, there's nothing that the Saudis, there's nothing the police anywhere can do to stop it.
[01:49:28.424 --> 01:49:32.007]  Which is why I sit and it gives me a great satisfaction knowing what's about to happen.
[01:49:33.542 --> 01:49:35.003]  Oh, we're making huge strides.
[01:49:35.043 --> 01:49:36.403]  I've seen that over the past year.
[01:49:36.443 --> 01:49:40.984]  We're really winning the narrative and that's why you see these populist parties having this great success.
[01:49:41.365 --> 01:49:46.366]  Finally, just in the final 30 seconds, Tommy, tell people where they can find you on Twitter and where they can get your book.
[01:49:47.767 --> 01:49:49.207]  So you can get my book on Amazon.
[01:49:50.628 --> 01:49:57.270]  The paperback copy is only available in England but you can buy the online version on any of the Amazons.
[01:49:57.650 --> 01:50:01.011]  And my Twitter handle is TommyRobinsonNewEra.
[01:50:02.478 --> 01:50:03.319]  So, thank you.
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:04.281]  And thanks, Paul.
[01:50:04.421 --> 01:50:04.781]  Thanks, Kim.
[01:50:15.131 --> 01:50:17.452]  Article in relation to what we were just talking about there.
[01:50:17.492 --> 01:50:18.592]  This is out of the Express.
[01:50:19.052 --> 01:50:20.473]  You cannot defend your women.
[01:50:20.673 --> 01:50:23.194]  Experts chilling theory behind cologne sex attacks.
[01:50:23.254 --> 01:50:30.436]  Because of course I mentioned you had all these migrants turn up to the exact same spot despite the fact that many of them were putting themselves at risk of arrest.
[01:50:30.756 --> 01:50:36.878]  Not only because of their criminal behavior but because of visa violations, immigration violations.
[01:50:37.398 --> 01:50:40.379]  But they turned up yet again in huge numbers.
[01:50:40.959 --> 01:50:49.045]  Despite knowing they would be surrounded by police, the police were then criticised by the left for preventing the mass molestation of women.
[01:50:49.105 --> 01:50:51.187]  God forbid, it was politically incorrect to do that.
[01:50:51.868 --> 01:50:59.193]  So now sex attackers who openly assaulted scores of women in Germany wanted to give Europeans the message they cannot protect women.
[01:51:00.014 --> 01:51:05.538]  That is what they say the message was being sent when those huge mobs of migrants turned up in Cologne.
[01:51:05.898 --> 01:51:08.961]  Yet again, we'll be back with the Alex Jones Show at 5 for breaking news.
[01:51:14.243 --> 01:51:25.286]  15 years ago, after, oh, 19 years as a reporter, it was clear to me that fake news was everywhere.
[01:51:26.126 --> 01:51:32.487]  And I wasn't talking about independent media or so-called alternative media.
[01:51:32.547 --> 01:51:35.568]  I was talking about mainstream media right from the beginning.
[01:51:37.023 --> 01:51:39.566]  That's where all the fake news was.
[01:51:40.567 --> 01:51:42.609]  So, hence, no more fake news.
[01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:51.298]  Somehow, these fake news sites, The Washington Post and other media outlets said, and they're now all getting on the bandwagon.
[01:51:52.019 --> 01:51:57.304]  These fake news sites, you see, are connected to... Russia.
[01:51:59.226 --> 01:51:59.487]  Why?
[01:52:01.104 --> 01:52:03.887]  What are we talking about here?
[01:52:03.907 --> 01:52:12.114]  100,000 fake news sites and bloggers that are somehow covertly working with the Russian government?
[01:52:13.255 --> 01:52:17.639]  I mean, the story was so preposterous on its face.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:20.902]  What are they even talking about?
[01:52:21.563 --> 01:52:26.688]  As my first logic teacher told us in class so many moons ago,
[01:52:28.218 --> 01:52:38.348]  The biggest weapon of non-logic and people who want to avoid rationality is the generality, the vague generality.
[01:52:39.268 --> 01:52:47.956]  Russia, fake news sites, fake news bloggers, oh yeah, it all stirs up in a pot, see, a gigantic pot.
[01:52:48.397 --> 01:52:50.259]  What does that mean, Russian hack?
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:53.642]  Well, of course, the implication is, in fact,
[01:52:55.197 --> 01:53:03.523]  That they did go into the machines, that they did go into the software, that they subverted the vote, that they changed the numbers, the actual numbers in the election.
[01:53:03.563 --> 01:53:07.446]  That's what the phrase, hack the election, said.
[01:53:08.066 --> 01:53:12.229]  To break it down, major media were basically saying, okay look,
[01:53:15.246 --> 01:53:25.094]  Russia hacked the Podesta, the Hillary, the DNC emails, and fed them to WikiLeaks.
[01:53:26.035 --> 01:53:36.063]  And then WikiLeaks released them, and then all of these fake news sites jumped on board and began splashing this all over the Internet.
[01:53:37.344 --> 01:53:37.564]  Now,
[01:53:38.857 --> 01:53:45.140]  If you talk to the editor of the Washington Post and you try to nail them down and say, this is what you're talking about?
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:45.941]  No, this is it?
[01:53:46.501 --> 01:53:49.302]  This is exactly what you mean and you don't mean anything else?
[01:53:49.382 --> 01:53:50.743]  No, we mean a lot of things.
[01:53:51.423 --> 01:53:52.684]  Don't try to pin me down.
[01:53:52.724 --> 01:53:54.565]  There's a whole lot of stuff going on here.
[01:53:54.685 --> 01:53:55.365]  Oh, yeah.
[01:53:56.065 --> 01:53:57.526]  And I know these people are fake.
[01:53:58.227 --> 01:54:01.068]  I've known it for 30 years that they're fake.
[01:54:01.748 --> 01:54:04.610]  And now they're basically saying, hey, look at us.
[01:54:04.690 --> 01:54:05.150]  We're fake.
[01:54:22.654 --> 01:54:37.443]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show, gonna dip back into the news and it's, it only gets more horrific as you'll see in a moment, but first we're gonna talk about a new product at InfoWarsStore.com, Tactical Nanotechnology Body Armor.
[01:54:37.523 --> 01:54:45.427]  Again, this was previously only available to military and law enforcement, it's now available exclusively for you at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:54:45.507 --> 01:54:47.709]  Over the past year, InfoWars has been working
[01:54:48.129 --> 01:54:54.992]  With some of the top special operators in the United States to source you the absolute highest quality and affordable body armor out there.
[01:54:55.012 --> 01:54:56.893]  You see it being demonstrated in this clip here.
[01:54:57.654 --> 01:55:06.758]  Our team of former Blackwater operators and Army Rangers analyzed and tested hundreds of different body armor technologies for their stopping power and safety.
[01:55:07.278 --> 01:55:15.382]  Now we've teamed up with the National Defense Laboratories to bring you an advanced nanotechnology body armor that until now was only available to the U.S.
[01:55:15.422 --> 01:55:16.703]  military and law enforcement.
[01:55:17.679 --> 01:55:23.400]  It's a quarter inch thick, it's field tested, it's confirmed to stop up to 50 AE pistol cartridges.
[01:55:24.534 --> 01:55:27.695]  And it's one of the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[01:55:28.715 --> 01:55:35.696]  It's a game-changing body armour that's waterproof, super lightweight, made in the USA, and comes with a 20-year warranty.
[01:55:36.316 --> 01:55:38.997]  And it is tactical nanotechnology body armour.
[01:55:39.617 --> 01:55:42.818]  Available at infowarsstore.com!
[01:55:43.378 --> 01:55:52.840]  The establishment is stockpiling food there, stockpiling riot gear, but if you do it, God forbid, you're a kook, you're a conspiracy theorist, you're a prepper!
[01:55:54.076 --> 01:55:55.477]  Well, it's up to you.
[01:55:55.817 --> 01:55:57.218]  They're doing it, so why shouldn't you?
[01:55:57.298 --> 01:55:58.458]  And it's available right now.
[01:55:58.598 --> 01:56:04.781]  InfoWarsStore.com supports this broadcast and we need your support now more than ever before.
[01:56:04.861 --> 01:56:10.524]  InfoWarsStore.com to get that and all the other great products with all the great discounts.
[01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:16.143]  Now I'm going to talk about this story in the final couple of minutes of this segment and into the next.
[01:56:16.883 --> 01:56:19.004]  This is truly, truly sick.
[01:56:19.164 --> 01:56:27.667]  We talk about the sewer pipe of popular culture on a regular basis on this show, and this is really right up there with one of the worst examples I've seen.
[01:56:28.267 --> 01:56:35.730]  The headline, which is up on InfoWars, is Fox Comedy Features Six-Year-Old Trans Boy Wearing Bondage Gag.
[01:56:36.490 --> 01:56:38.851]  And I considered playing the clip, but then it was just
[01:56:39.811 --> 01:56:40.932]  Absolutely disgusting.
[01:56:41.773 --> 01:56:43.334]  Made my mind up not to play it.
[01:56:44.134 --> 01:56:44.995]  You can go and watch it.
[01:56:45.055 --> 01:56:46.536]  It's in the article if you want to watch it.
[01:56:47.117 --> 01:56:51.900]  A sickening new comedy show on Fox features a six-year-old boy wearing a bondage gag.
[01:56:54.602 --> 01:56:57.484]  Not just wearing a bondage gag, they dress him up as a girl.
[01:56:58.245 --> 01:56:59.406]  Absolutely hideous.
[01:56:59.466 --> 01:57:04.429]  Again, more example of this trash, nihilistic, vapid, amoral culture.
[01:57:05.475 --> 01:57:09.779]  Which teaches people that there really are no morals, there's no reason to be good.
[01:57:09.919 --> 01:57:14.463]  Just be completely nihilistic, mindless.
[01:57:15.831 --> 01:57:19.852]  Treat everyone like crap and just do what you want to do with your life and there will be no consequences.
[01:57:19.892 --> 01:57:21.273]  Well, there are consequences.
[01:57:21.693 --> 01:57:25.374]  In fact, I made a video about that, the truth about depression, just the other day.
[01:57:26.174 --> 01:57:43.839]  The article continues, the boy, who is apparently transgendered, because now apparently it's acceptable for children as young as six or eight years old to be transgendered, is seen wearing the gag after burning his tongue licking a hot grill at a restaurant in exchange for a thousand dollars from his older teenage brother.
[01:57:44.719 --> 01:57:46.700]  The Fox show is named The Mic.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:48.441]  It aired on January 1st.
[01:57:48.481 --> 01:57:54.944]  It was created by Dave Chernin and John Chernin, both sons of top Hollywood executive Peter Chernin.
[01:57:55.484 --> 01:58:04.348]  Other scenes show the boy dressing like a girl and commenting how the dress he's wearing, quote, kind of breezes on my vagina.
[01:58:05.388 --> 01:58:05.989]  So they've got
[01:58:06.949 --> 01:58:13.733]  A six-year-old boy dressed up in a sadomasochistic ball gag drooling from his mouth.
[01:58:14.133 --> 01:58:17.735]  They dress him up as a girl and have him talk about his vagina.
[01:58:19.415 --> 01:58:25.138]  Another scene, and I'm sorry I even have to say this, but this is in a primetime Fox show right now.
[01:58:25.519 --> 01:58:31.642]  Another scene shows the boy celebrate after a man's eye is impaled in front of him by a woman's high-heeled shoe.
[01:58:32.731 --> 01:58:34.511]  Again, complete misandry.
[01:58:34.892 --> 01:58:37.312]  Depicting violence against men, that's perfectly fine.
[01:58:37.912 --> 01:58:42.153]  As blood is shooting on the boy's face and clothes, he exclaims, Cool!
[01:58:43.514 --> 01:58:44.394]  Absolutely sickening.
[01:58:44.434 --> 01:58:47.094]  We'll be back with more on the Alex Jones Show after the break.
[01:58:47.334 --> 01:58:48.875]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[01:58:51.175 --> 01:58:54.716]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:54.736 --> 01:58:56.877]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.637 --> 01:59:02.358]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[01:59:04.153 --> 01:59:09.818]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:59:10.518 --> 01:59:14.502]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:59:15.362 --> 01:59:17.584]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:59:17.684 --> 01:59:18.845]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:59:18.865 --> 01:59:22.088]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[01:59:23.049 --> 01:59:23.409]  Or more.
[01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:25.431]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:59:25.931 --> 01:59:27.392]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[01:59:27.492 --> 01:59:30.855]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:59:30.955 --> 01:59:32.717]  It's actually scary.
[01:59:33.597 --> 01:59:43.684]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:59:44.665 --> 01:59:57.493]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[02:00:01.488 --> 02:00:07.472]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:25.943]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.509 --> 02:00:36.151]  Warren Southern is coming up in the next segment, but we're going to continue with this story.
[02:00:36.171 --> 02:00:37.652]  Again, absolutely chilling.
[02:00:38.112 --> 02:00:39.253]  Information Liberation.
[02:00:39.293 --> 02:00:40.493]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:00:40.513 --> 02:00:42.455]  I think Drudge Reports posted this as well.
[02:00:42.515 --> 02:00:49.619]  It's by Chris Menehan, who comes out with a really... a lot of great articles at their website, Information Liberation.
[02:00:50.579 --> 02:01:00.705]  A Fox News show depicts a six-year-old boy wearing a bondage gag, dressing like a girl, and commenting on his, quote, vagina.
[02:01:01.752 --> 02:01:03.113]  Go and watch the clip as well.
[02:01:03.414 --> 02:01:05.536]  Absolute trash television.
[02:01:06.316 --> 02:01:07.257]  Why do we see this?
[02:01:07.538 --> 02:01:19.549]  Oh, and by the way, another scene in the show shows one of the characters awkwardly praising Planned Parenthood, plugging how they provide healthcare to over 3 million women in this country.
[02:01:20.376 --> 02:01:24.342]  Meanwhile, they're cancelling shows on Adult Swim that talk about the alt-right.
[02:01:24.382 --> 02:01:25.083]  You can't do that.
[02:01:25.123 --> 02:01:25.684]  That's evil.
[02:01:25.964 --> 02:01:32.934]  But you can depict a six-year-old boy with a homoerotic, a sadomasochistic ball gag in his mouth.
[02:01:33.014 --> 02:01:34.196]  Yeah, that's okay.
[02:01:34.336 --> 02:01:35.217]  That's perfectly fine.
[02:01:35.257 --> 02:01:35.918]  That's acceptable.
[02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:38.230]  Why do we see this over and over again?
[02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:55.499]  Why do we see Salon.com and these left-wing publications giving platforms to actual paedophiles to talk about how their quote illness should be accepted by society as just another form of sexual preference?
[02:01:56.858 --> 02:01:58.739]  Over and over again, not just once, oh no!
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:15.971]  And they will produce interview segments, we've played them before, with self-confessed paedophiles, like Todd Nickerson, where they produce dream-like scenes of little girls twirling around in skirts, as the paedophile on camera talks about masturbating over them.
[02:02:16.974 --> 02:02:18.335]  That's the left for you.
[02:02:18.935 --> 02:02:21.357]  They will produce articles like this one out of Cracked.
[02:02:21.577 --> 02:02:22.537]  Cracked.com.
[02:02:23.418 --> 02:02:27.000]  Five things I learned from being addicted to child porn.
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:29.981]  There you see the Todd Nickerson one out of Salon.com.
[02:02:30.302 --> 02:02:32.563]  There's also a new one out of Cracked.com.
[02:02:33.784 --> 02:02:35.004]  I couldn't believe this but it's true.
[02:02:35.104 --> 02:02:38.346]  Five things I learned from being addicted to child porn.
[02:02:38.386 --> 02:02:39.407]  That is the headline.
[02:02:40.047 --> 02:02:42.449]  Why are they mainstreaming pedophilia?
[02:02:43.482 --> 02:02:47.483]  Why are they giving platforms to pedophiles like Todd Nickerson?
[02:02:47.963 --> 02:03:00.907]  Well, if you look at the history of sexual theology, how we came to understand sexual theology, how it was interpreted in the 60s, in the 70s, then it takes you back to people like Alfred Kinsey.
[02:03:01.408 --> 02:03:05.569]  Every single one of these professors that came up with the dominant theories
[02:03:06.249 --> 02:03:08.390]  about what motivates humans sexually.
[02:03:09.131 --> 02:03:11.492]  Every single one of them was a leftist, obviously.
[02:03:11.993 --> 02:03:15.275]  They became the icons of the sexual liberation movement.
[02:03:15.835 --> 02:03:17.296]  They became the go-to source.
[02:03:18.076 --> 02:03:22.319]  Every single one of them was a leftist and every single one of them was a complete pervert!
[02:03:22.379 --> 02:03:23.560]  Well, imagine my shock!
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:33.646]  These people conducted absolutely insane, bizarre experiments to try and justify and legitimize and prove their own perverted theories.
[02:03:34.454 --> 02:03:36.295]  Now, I can't even get into the details.
[02:03:36.815 --> 02:03:39.637]  There was one, for example, he was a British philosopher.
[02:03:40.618 --> 02:03:48.382]  He laid down a lot of the foundational work, material information about how humans are motivated sexually.
[02:03:49.122 --> 02:03:50.763]  He was motivated sexually.
[02:03:51.744 --> 02:03:55.206]  Again, I'm not even sure how much of this I can say for a PG audience.
[02:03:56.465 --> 02:04:05.531]  He could only get off sexually by the age of about 50 by his wife doing business on his body.
[02:04:06.552 --> 02:04:06.912]  Okay?
[02:04:07.832 --> 02:04:11.935]  He's celebrated by the left as an icon of sexual theology.
[02:04:11.995 --> 02:04:15.497]  He's the go-to source on how we should all think about sex.
[02:04:16.098 --> 02:04:19.160]  Somebody who's a pervert, then you have Alfred Kinsey.
[02:04:20.526 --> 02:04:24.591]  In fact, LifeSite News has an article, Alfred Kinsey was a pervert and a sex criminal.
[02:04:25.171 --> 02:04:36.785]  Go and read about the experiments on children conducted by Alfred Kinsey to prove his sexual theories about what motivates sexual behavior in humans.
[02:04:37.265 --> 02:04:38.847]  That will answer your question.
[02:04:39.528 --> 02:04:49.456]  as to why the left gives platforms to pedophiles, why Fox has shows with six-year-old transgender boys wearing bondage gags.
[02:04:49.896 --> 02:04:57.743]  They want to mainstream hedonistic, vile trash because it's completely amoral, the gloves are off,
[02:04:58.243 --> 02:05:07.814]  And then conservatives are completely removed from the political arena because again, there is no rules and everyone panders to this amoral trash lifestyle.
[02:05:07.854 --> 02:05:08.915]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:05:08.955 --> 02:05:09.435]  Don't go away.
[02:05:09.936 --> 02:05:11.177]  Wars are not cheap.
[02:05:11.217 --> 02:05:15.602]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[02:05:16.423 --> 02:05:19.224]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[02:05:19.784 --> 02:05:20.804]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[02:05:20.945 --> 02:05:22.285]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[02:05:22.905 --> 02:05:29.707]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[02:05:30.047 --> 02:05:34.369]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[02:05:35.009 --> 02:05:44.132]  That's why on major third party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[02:05:45.032 --> 02:05:56.716]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic and the world.
[02:05:57.136 --> 02:05:58.817]  We apply to the products we bring in.
[02:05:59.717 --> 02:06:06.082]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[02:06:06.703 --> 02:06:11.046]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[02:06:11.067 --> 02:06:12.348]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[02:06:12.368 --> 02:06:14.830]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've
[02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.751]  I think so.
[02:06:33.413 --> 02:06:34.674]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[02:06:35.094 --> 02:06:36.095]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[02:06:36.115 --> 02:06:38.356]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[02:06:38.397 --> 02:06:39.477]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[02:06:39.677 --> 02:06:44.601]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[02:06:44.781 --> 02:06:46.382]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[02:06:46.402 --> 02:06:48.984]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[02:06:49.164 --> 02:06:53.908]  Now, it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing.
[02:06:54.528 --> 02:07:05.156]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, BioPQQ, you name it, 170-plus studies.
[02:07:05.196 --> 02:07:06.157]  We can make claims on this.
[02:07:06.197 --> 02:07:12.262]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[02:07:13.042 --> 02:07:14.843]  I've got this at my fingertips, at cost.
[02:07:14.923 --> 02:07:15.703]  I forget to take it.
[02:07:15.723 --> 02:07:16.644]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[02:07:16.704 --> 02:07:18.544]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[02:07:18.624 --> 02:07:20.805]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:21.826]  Well, guess what?
[02:07:21.866 --> 02:07:23.106]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[02:07:23.487 --> 02:07:24.087]  It's discounted.
[02:07:24.347 --> 02:07:27.368]  Now, in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[02:07:27.388 --> 02:07:28.809]  A lot of the products we have left
[02:07:29.349 --> 02:07:34.133]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[02:07:34.493 --> 02:07:39.237]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[02:07:39.597 --> 02:07:40.698]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[02:07:42.119 --> 02:07:43.940]  Secret 12, 20% off.
[02:07:44.101 --> 02:07:45.261]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[02:07:45.482 --> 02:07:47.123]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[02:07:47.443 --> 02:07:50.486]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid, I love taking it every day, 20% off.
[02:07:50.746 --> 02:07:51.967]  Prostagard, 20% off.
[02:07:52.307 --> 02:07:54.168]  And many others at fullwarslife.com.
[02:07:55.049 --> 02:07:58.812]  You are literally energizing this operation against the global assault.
[02:07:58.832 --> 02:08:07.040]  I want to again salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:08.321]  Make our bodies great again.
[02:08:19.242 --> 02:08:20.962]  You want answers?
[02:08:21.002 --> 02:08:23.263]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:23.383 --> 02:08:30.185]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.225 --> 02:08:31.425]  We're live.
[02:08:31.485 --> 02:08:39.407]  This is the final hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson, on this Thursday, January 5th edition.
[02:08:40.007 --> 02:08:41.807]  We had the breaking news a while ago.
[02:08:42.287 --> 02:08:44.248]  Of course, we've been talking about it the whole show.
[02:08:44.748 --> 02:08:45.408]  The kidnap.
[02:08:45.948 --> 02:08:51.271]  The torture of the mentally disabled man in Chicago, racially abused, attacked.
[02:08:51.671 --> 02:09:03.216]  The police initially came out and said that it wasn't racially motivated, despite the fact they were yelling F white people in his face while cutting chunks out of his head.
[02:09:04.156 --> 02:09:06.217]  Not racially motivated at all, no.
[02:09:06.758 --> 02:09:10.940]  Now they're saying that the culprits, the four culprits, are being charged with
[02:09:12.045 --> 02:09:12.607]  Hate crime?
[02:09:12.968 --> 02:09:16.821]  It remains to be seen what the characteristic of that hate crime is.
[02:09:16.841 --> 02:09:18.807]  I read the law earlier in Chicago.
[02:09:19.989 --> 02:09:25.474]  Mental disability, if somebody is targeted for assault on that basis, is a hate crime.
[02:09:25.874 --> 02:09:27.196]  Is that what they're going to run with?
[02:09:27.696 --> 02:09:32.961]  Because it still appears that they're denying that this had any racial connotation whatsoever.
[02:09:33.521 --> 02:09:35.243]  Absolutely ludicrous.
[02:09:35.263 --> 02:09:37.285]  We're going to get our guest's take on that now.
[02:09:37.985 --> 02:09:43.270]  She's been on the show many times before and it is Lauren Southern, commentator at TheRebel.media.
[02:09:44.632 --> 02:09:50.446]  Author of the new book, Barbarians, How Baby Boomers, Immigrants and Islam Screwed My Generation.
[02:09:50.927 --> 02:09:51.809]  Lauren, welcome back.
[02:09:53.132 --> 02:09:54.014]  Thanks for having me, Paul.
[02:09:55.196 --> 02:09:58.278]  Now, of course, I've been talking about this basically throughout the entire show.
[02:09:58.918 --> 02:10:05.181]  You had the police come out after this brutal attack in Chicago and say, Oh, the kids were just being stupid.
[02:10:05.221 --> 02:10:08.403]  They were just, they weren't doing this because it was racially motivated.
[02:10:08.423 --> 02:10:10.204]  They were just messing around and being stupid.
[02:10:10.644 --> 02:10:12.725]  Well, they are being charged with hate crimes now.
[02:10:13.225 --> 02:10:18.128]  But again, it looks like it could be due to mental disability, nothing to do with racial motivation.
[02:10:19.048 --> 02:10:33.635]  This white, mentally disabled teen, again, abducted for two days, tortured, beaten, humiliated, forced to drink toilet water, racially abused as it was all live-streamed on Facebook.
[02:10:34.315 --> 02:10:35.596]  But I mean, Lauren, he's white.
[02:10:36.196 --> 02:10:38.257]  He had institutional power.
[02:10:38.617 --> 02:10:40.138]  So it can't be racist, right?
[02:10:41.215 --> 02:10:42.015]  Of course not.
[02:10:42.296 --> 02:10:43.436]  It's really amazing.
[02:10:43.476 --> 02:10:50.220]  We're starting out 2017 as many of us expected it would start out with once again proving fake news.
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:51.800]  They said Donald Trump wouldn't win.
[02:10:52.221 --> 02:10:56.303]  Then when he did win they said that this year would be the year that we would see a
[02:10:57.183 --> 02:11:10.889]  Huge rise in hate crimes against minorities and that the Trump camp would be invigorated by his hate speech and supremacy and just a massive Hitler nation against blacks and Mexicans.
[02:11:11.290 --> 02:11:12.650]  But no, what did we see instead?
[02:11:12.690 --> 02:11:22.415]  We saw a wave of fake hate crimes and now to start off 2017, a white disabled man being kidnapped by blacks and being tortured.
[02:11:22.995 --> 02:11:23.715]  What are they going to do?
[02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:24.776]  What are they going to run with?
[02:11:25.236 --> 02:11:30.198]  Well, CNN has gone and said that these are just troubled kids.
[02:11:30.298 --> 02:11:34.599]  Even the sheriff has said these are, you know, kids will be kids, boys will be boys.
[02:11:34.979 --> 02:11:36.220]  I mean, I remember being a kid.
[02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:45.263]  Maybe the worst thing I did was stand outside a liquor store and ask someone to buy me booze, but I don't quite remember kidnapping an Asian family and torturing them.
[02:11:45.743 --> 02:11:48.164]  This isn't a kids will be kids situation.
[02:11:48.364 --> 02:11:54.006]  Who really has the institutional power when they can get away with this and be defended for it?
[02:11:54.146 --> 02:11:54.646]  It's unreal.
[02:11:56.345 --> 02:11:57.726]  Yeah, I don't remember.
[02:11:57.746 --> 02:12:01.648]  I mean, I don't have many memories as a child because they've kind of faded away now.
[02:12:02.048 --> 02:12:11.273]  But I don't remember kidnapping somebody for two days, torturing them, forcing them to drink toilet water, cutting chunks out of their scalp, racially abusing them.
[02:12:11.593 --> 02:12:13.034]  That doesn't cross my memory.
[02:12:13.854 --> 02:12:17.917]  If that is the level for kids will be kids, then we're in big trouble.
[02:12:18.277 --> 02:12:23.039]  I mean, what part of the blame do you apportion, not just to Black Lives Matter?
[02:12:23.059 --> 02:12:24.360]  We're going to go on to talk about that.
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:35.837]  But this idea that anti-white racism and it being acceptable to be anti-white is now not only acceptable, but thanks to BuzzFeed, thanks to MTV, it's kinda cute!
[02:12:36.377 --> 02:12:39.182]  How much blame do you apportion to that kind of cultural meme?
[02:12:40.888 --> 02:12:43.389]  Right, it's almost a, yeah, it's a cool thing now.
[02:12:43.689 --> 02:12:59.212]  When I speak, I just recently tweeted out against Ariana Grande for some ridiculous statement she made, and I got retweeted by a big celebrity, Hasley, and every single reply I got from all these young accounts, 14, 15, 16, was, shut up, whitey.
[02:12:59.232 --> 02:13:06.734]  It didn't matter if these people were any race, even if they were white, they were saying, shut up, whitey, pasty, mayo, all these things.
[02:13:06.814 --> 02:13:07.994]  It's seen as a hip
[02:13:08.454 --> 02:13:09.355]  Cultural trend.
[02:13:10.096 --> 02:13:11.677]  Great job, BuzzFeed.
[02:13:11.837 --> 02:13:13.259]  Great job, CNN.
[02:13:13.299 --> 02:13:15.301]  You've made it cool to be racist.
[02:13:15.721 --> 02:13:22.528]  And we need to get rid of this idea of reverse racism because you've got some pundits saying, see, reverse racism does exist.
[02:13:22.728 --> 02:13:24.950]  Well, no, it's not reverse racism.
[02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:26.491]  It's just racism.
[02:13:26.531 --> 02:13:28.373]  And we need to accept that.
[02:13:28.433 --> 02:13:30.015]  The government needs to accept that.
[02:13:30.055 --> 02:13:33.398]  And as much as I'm not really for the idea of hate crimes, I think
[02:13:33.758 --> 02:13:39.584]  Most crimes like this are all motivated by hate, no matter who it's against, or if it's a white-on-white, black-on-black.
[02:13:40.004 --> 02:13:41.446]  They're all kind of hateful.
[02:13:41.946 --> 02:13:49.374]  But they need to recognize this as being the exact same as four white people kidnapping a black guy, saying, F-black people, and beating him up.
[02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:50.935]  It's just racism.
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:14:09.491]  And I mean, it is really an echo chamber with this cuteness of anti-white racism because, you know, people pick it up from BuzzFeed, from MTV, they tweet out things like, oh, happy new year everyone, except white people, happy Christmas everyone, even like, good morning everyone, except white people.
[02:14:09.792 --> 02:14:13.754]  Half the time it's actually other white people saying it, which is bizarre.
[02:14:14.134 --> 02:14:22.280]  But you notice that when you quote their tweet, or when you respond to their tweet, mostly within hours or even minutes,
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:27.484]  They either delete the tweet or claim that you've harassed them merely for quoting the tweet.
[02:14:27.844 --> 02:14:34.569]  So I think it still shows that they don't even know that this is unacceptable to engage in flagrant racism.
[02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:41.455]  As soon as they step outside the bubble and they actually face some criticism for this, they completely implode.
[02:14:41.815 --> 02:14:43.276]  They completely panic, right?
[02:14:44.158 --> 02:14:51.420]  Well, there are a whole generation of people that have grown up on not any sort of political ideology, but rather just the ideology of conformity.
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:55.901]  You'll notice a lot of these accounts, if people have engaged with them, are all pretty much the same.
[02:14:55.941 --> 02:15:13.346]  They all have the little Snapchat flower crown filter, they've got their little gendered pronouns, or the dog face, and all their tweets are not spelt properly, and they're all about lipstick, eyebrows, and tweeting at celebrities, and then suddenly they'll get engaged with politics, and it'll all be, screw white people.
[02:15:13.766 --> 02:15:14.927]  Where do you think they're learning this?
[02:15:14.967 --> 02:15:19.630]  They're learning it from the Kardashians, they're learning it in their classrooms, they're learning it from BuzzFeed.
[02:15:19.690 --> 02:15:22.893]  It is totally a cultural thing and none of it is unique.
[02:15:23.033 --> 02:15:24.934]  All these people are conformists.
[02:15:25.014 --> 02:15:26.656]  It's an ideology of conformity.
[02:15:26.696 --> 02:15:40.586]  They have no individual personalities, no ability to question and see the nuance in the fact that maybe white privilege doesn't exist when a white guy can be at special needs and get beat up and scalped and choked and
[02:15:40.606 --> 02:15:48.915]  And they can't see that nuance because it's all a young generation of conformity and they have conformed to the worst aspects of our culture.
[02:15:49.215 --> 02:15:56.843]  And that's what happens when parents say, don't give your kids any ideology, let the culture dictate that.
[02:15:56.923 --> 02:16:02.709]  Well, they adopt what the modern culture is and our modern culture is, quite frankly, cancerous right now.
[02:16:04.513 --> 02:16:10.057]  Exactly, I mean, I was just talking, we'll get on to that, but it's really percolated down into the culture.
[02:16:10.077 --> 02:16:13.380]  I don't think you had that as little as 10, 20 years ago.
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:26.369]  You know, you could fight leftist narratives, you could engage in that political debate on a level playing field where at least you knew you were debating with people who knew how to debate, who knew at least how to spell, as you mentioned,
[02:16:26.849 --> 02:16:42.399]  But this has percolated down into the culture, whereas people who normally wouldn't embrace anything political, right, they wouldn't, the kind of people who put, you know, Instagram filters on their Twitter photos, they wouldn't even embrace anything political, they wouldn't be interested in it.
[02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:53.687]  But now they're getting involved in it, and that toxic combination between extremism and stupidity is exactly what's fostering a lot of this anti-white rhetoric, correct?
[02:16:54.673 --> 02:16:55.556]  Oh, absolutely!
[02:16:58.238 --> 02:17:11.064]  The biggest thing that's happening too is it's being spearheaded by celebrities and that's why you have all of these videos coming out with celebrities supporting Clinton, celebrities making videos of we need to oppose Donald Trump, a big one just came out recently.
[02:17:11.444 --> 02:17:18.127]  Because if a celebrity does it, it's cool and people are going to follow it whether that celebrity has an argument or not.
[02:17:18.467 --> 02:17:26.911]  And we need more people, I don't know if you saw Tommy Robinson the other day, he was challenging, oh what's her name, she's a British singer.
[02:17:27.651 --> 02:17:29.773]  Lily Allen, yeah, we just got him on to talk about it.
[02:17:30.213 --> 02:17:33.877]  He embarrassed her, absolutely, on social media and we need more stuff like that.
[02:17:33.937 --> 02:17:50.272]  We need more commentators and individuals calling out celebrities because if you can embarrass them on social media, get retweeted by Lily Allen with counter-arguments, these total conformist, just indoctrinated people will actually see there are other arguments.
[02:17:50.672 --> 02:18:02.820]  There are people with different ideas out there, and I think Tommy Robinson has done an excellent job of destroying people like Lily Allen and that, and that's just what we're going to have to keep doing when it comes to this anti-white narrative as well.
[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:14.288]  We're seeing bigger figures, figures like Philip DeFranco, H3H3, big YouTubers that are with a lot of normal young generation come out and speak out against BuzzFeed and MTV for their anti-white racism.
[02:18:14.808 --> 02:18:20.192]  Because we are challenging them over and over and over again until our arguments are too good to deny.
[02:18:20.253 --> 02:18:28.459]  And truly I do believe that will eventually work, but it's going to take a lot of cleansing out these people's indoctrinated minds.
[02:18:30.301 --> 02:18:34.384]  Now, I want to talk about BLM because I've received all these messages over the past six hours or so.
[02:18:35.031 --> 02:18:36.813]  How dare you connect this to BLM?
[02:18:36.833 --> 02:18:38.114]  There's no connection whatsoever.
[02:18:38.754 --> 02:18:40.256]  Well, there is a connection.
[02:18:40.636 --> 02:18:48.623]  You've had these Black Lives Matter agitators, you've been around them for the past two years plus, chanting for dead cops, dead white cops specifically.
[02:18:48.663 --> 02:18:50.505]  They've killed black cops as well, well done.
[02:18:51.065 --> 02:18:53.588]  Or at least their message has led to the slaughter of black cops.
[02:18:53.968 --> 02:18:59.513]  You know, we've seen them target white people for beatings during the Charlotte riots in the underground parking lot.
[02:18:59.833 --> 02:19:05.141]  We've seen BLM supporters, every time a cop is killed on Twitter, they celebrate it.
[02:19:05.461 --> 02:19:09.006]  You know, their ideological guru is a cop killing convicted terrorists.
[02:19:09.407 --> 02:19:11.930]  You know, they planned to bomb the Ferguson police station.
[02:19:12.291 --> 02:19:14.954]  The gunman in Dallas said that he wanted to kill whites.
[02:19:15.495 --> 02:19:28.323]  How can the mainstream media who have legitimized this movement, how can anyone claim that Black Lives Matter is a peaceful movement and that their violent anti-white rhetoric doesn't lead to instances like this?
[02:19:28.623 --> 02:19:30.064]  There's got to be a connection, right?
[02:19:30.899 --> 02:19:33.840]  I'm getting cracked on a lot for that on Twitter too.
[02:19:33.860 --> 02:19:45.225]  They're saying, they're making huge listicles with yourself, with people like Glenn Beck and other, and Tommy Loren saying, look at these people connecting this to Black Lives Matter when it has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.
[02:19:45.926 --> 02:19:46.666]  Sound familiar?
[02:19:46.986 --> 02:19:49.127]  Nothing to do with the religion of peace, right?
[02:19:49.187 --> 02:19:51.028]  They always have these excuses, but
[02:19:51.448 --> 02:19:55.129]  But if Dylan Roof kills people in a church, then it's all white people's fault.
[02:19:55.169 --> 02:19:57.590]  We'll be back with Lauren Southern after the break.
[02:19:57.851 --> 02:20:01.332]  It's the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at infowars.com.
[02:20:01.352 --> 02:20:01.972]  Don't go away.
[02:20:10.215 --> 02:20:11.476]  Happiness is earned.
[02:20:12.616 --> 02:20:15.898]  The way you live your life determines whether you're happy or not.
[02:20:16.218 --> 02:20:18.559]  You can't live your life in a damaging way.
[02:20:20.137 --> 02:20:22.241]  And just hate people, hate the world around you.
[02:20:22.702 --> 02:20:24.665]  Have no actual bonds with anyone.
[02:20:25.126 --> 02:20:28.271]  Not be authentic to yourself and then just expect to be happy.
[02:20:30.526 --> 02:20:31.766]  You have to earn that happiness.
[02:20:32.406 --> 02:20:34.787]  And again, we have the culture, this dead-end culture.
[02:20:35.727 --> 02:20:41.469]  You know, encouraging everyone to be depressed at the end of the day because it's a hedonistic, meaningless culture.
[02:20:42.229 --> 02:20:44.569]  It encourages people to embrace that hedonism.
[02:20:45.610 --> 02:20:47.870]  When it's meaningless, it's not going to fulfill them.
[02:20:48.470 --> 02:20:50.691]  It only brings ruin, it only brings regret.
[02:20:51.511 --> 02:20:55.935]  So again, this is what the British author Theodore Dalrymple said about this.
[02:20:55.955 --> 02:20:57.596]  Listen to this quote from Theodore Dalrymple.
[02:21:10.606 --> 02:21:17.137]  Which has almost entirely eliminated the word and even the concept of unhappiness from modern life.
[02:21:17.657 --> 02:21:24.508]  Of the thousands of patients I have seen, only two or three have ever claimed to be unhappy.
[02:21:25.635 --> 02:21:27.676]  All the rest have said that they were depressed.
[02:21:28.497 --> 02:21:35.802]  This semantic shift is deeply significant for it implies that dissatisfaction with life itself is pathological.
[02:21:36.503 --> 02:21:43.388]  A medical condition, which it is the responsibility of the doctor to alleviate by medical means.
[02:21:45.508 --> 02:21:49.129]  Again, 4 in 10 American women in their 40s and 50s on antidepressants.
[02:21:49.470 --> 02:21:54.251]  1 in 10 Americans, and that's probably old figures, on antidepressants.
[02:21:54.831 --> 02:21:58.012]  It continues, everyone has a right to health.
[02:21:58.492 --> 02:22:04.454]  Depression is unhealthy, therefore everyone has a right to be happy, the opposite of being depressed.
[02:22:05.214 --> 02:22:14.100]  This idea in turn implies that one's state of mind or one's mood is or should be independent of the way that one lives one's life.
[02:22:14.860 --> 02:22:22.405]  A belief that must deprive human existence of all meaning, radically disconnecting reward from conduct.
[02:22:22.866 --> 02:22:25.608]  So again, it's this idea that you can live your life in whatever
[02:22:26.548 --> 02:22:28.349]  Irresponsible way imaginable.
[02:22:28.669 --> 02:22:31.270]  Whatever damaging way imaginable.
[02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:34.791]  And still, after all that, be happy.
[02:22:34.971 --> 02:22:36.632]  Well no, it doesn't work like that.
[02:22:37.852 --> 02:22:46.055]  That's why depression has increased, because at least in the past, you know, people didn't have the quality of life that we have access to now.
[02:22:46.115 --> 02:22:47.276]  They weren't living longer.
[02:22:47.656 --> 02:22:48.556]  They weren't healthier.
[02:22:48.776 --> 02:22:50.497]  They struggled with more illnesses.
[02:22:51.117 --> 02:22:52.458]  And yet, they were happier.
[02:22:54.884 --> 02:22:58.148]  It all boils down to the fact that they were living authentic lives.
[02:22:58.549 --> 02:23:01.152]  They knew that happiness wasn't a right.
[02:23:01.693 --> 02:23:04.536]  You have to earn it by the way you live your life.
[02:23:04.556 --> 02:23:05.377]  It comes from within.
[02:23:05.738 --> 02:23:09.803]  It comes from the way you conduct yourself in your life.
[02:23:19.921 --> 02:23:27.845]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:27.905 --> 02:23:31.007]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[02:23:31.823 --> 02:23:33.684]  And they're also very affordable.
[02:23:55.811 --> 02:24:02.538]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[02:24:02.938 --> 02:24:03.699]  It's a win-win.
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:04.961]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:24:24.912 --> 02:24:32.697]  We're about five on the Alex Jones Show, gonna go back to Lauren Southern here in a second, but first I want to remind you of the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.

[02:25:02.098 --> 02:25:08.223]  The bandwidth, the giant equipment costs, sending reporters all around the world, flights, hotel bills.
[02:25:08.663 --> 02:25:13.147]  God forbid we would actually sell nutritional products to fund that.
[02:25:13.507 --> 02:25:14.228]  Aren't we evil?
[02:25:14.268 --> 02:25:18.512]  We should be taking money from Gulf state dictatorships like Bahrain.
[02:25:18.812 --> 02:25:20.954]  That's what CNN does and they're credible.
[02:25:21.394 --> 02:25:25.077]  We should be taking money from billionaire globalists like George Soros.
[02:25:25.138 --> 02:25:26.319]  Black Lives Matter does that.
[02:25:27.059 --> 02:25:27.760]  And they're credible.
[02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:31.203]  But we're evil because we sell nutritional products.
[02:25:31.884 --> 02:25:35.327]  And we're grateful for you purchasing them at infowarslife.com.
[02:25:36.508 --> 02:25:44.511]  Because it's built this platform, it's enabled us to expand, to grow to where we are now, which is why the mainstream media is so terrified of us.
[02:25:44.891 --> 02:25:49.193]  And those specials are continued at infowarslife.com.
[02:25:49.673 --> 02:25:54.815]  Speaking about the mainstream media being terrified of us, and Lauren mentioned it there before the break, we have these headlines.
[02:25:55.155 --> 02:25:55.935]  Chicagoist.
[02:25:56.455 --> 02:26:00.257]  The BLM kidnapping hashtag makes a horrific tragedy even worse.
[02:26:01.277 --> 02:26:08.181]  Right, so a hashtag is even worse than the kidnapping of a mentally disabled boy.
[02:26:08.781 --> 02:26:11.043]  The torture, the 48-hour torture of him.
[02:26:11.083 --> 02:26:12.504]  Okay, a hashtag's worse, alright.
[02:26:13.424 --> 02:26:14.125]  Gizmodo.
[02:26:14.685 --> 02:26:18.887]  Alt-right trolls use Chicago kidnapping to spread lies about Black Lives Matter.
[02:26:19.448 --> 02:26:28.193]  So basically they're saying, and the police, the Chicago police, who have come out with some absolutely ridiculous statements, by the way, are now saying, oh, this has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.
[02:26:28.633 --> 02:26:29.814]  Do you think for a second
[02:26:30.294 --> 02:26:44.101]  If four Trump supporters had kidnapped an 18-year-old disabled black kid for 48 hours, tortured him and racially abused him, that the media would say that had anything whatsoever to do with the alt-right?
[02:26:44.481 --> 02:26:45.561]  Well, of course they would.
[02:26:46.162 --> 02:26:49.043]  The difference, of course, is that that's not happening.
[02:26:49.643 --> 02:26:55.026]  All the hate crimes blamed on Trump supporters are hoaxes faked by leftists
[02:26:55.746 --> 02:26:59.289]  On the flip side, BLM-inspired violence is happening.
[02:26:59.570 --> 02:27:01.051]  It's happened over and over again.
[02:27:01.331 --> 02:27:03.713]  You had people murdering cops.
[02:27:04.274 --> 02:27:07.657]  In Dallas, he directly said he wanted to kill white people.
[02:27:07.897 --> 02:27:10.900]  They plotted to bomb the Ferguson police station.
[02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:16.185]  Ishmael Brinsley, the killer in New York, said he shot two cops in the head.
[02:27:16.525 --> 02:27:31.099]  As a Black Lives Matter revenge attack documented examples of this anti-white racial narrative that's been created by Black Lives Matter, supported by the media, and it leads to situations like this.
[02:27:31.559 --> 02:27:33.920]  Yes, there's an obvious connection.
[02:27:34.241 --> 02:27:36.482]  Black Lives Matter is not a group.
[02:27:36.902 --> 02:27:38.363]  It doesn't have a headquarters.
[02:27:38.863 --> 02:27:40.064]  It's an ideology.
[02:27:40.484 --> 02:27:42.405]  Ideologies lead to actions.
[02:27:42.726 --> 02:27:44.227]  It's an extremist ideology.
[02:27:44.487 --> 02:27:45.948]  It's a racist ideology.
[02:27:46.208 --> 02:27:50.150]  And it's leading to racist attacks against white people.
[02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:56.614]  No matter how many headlines you put up, being outraged about my tweets about that, that is a fact.
[02:27:57.174 --> 02:27:57.975]  Lauren Southern.
[02:27:58.635 --> 02:28:02.882]  Do you see a connection between BLM and this latest incident in Chicago?
[02:28:04.907 --> 02:28:13.855]  Right, so the narrative is the alt-right, alt-light, right-wingers are trying to smear Black Lives Matter by connecting them to this incident.
[02:28:14.515 --> 02:28:16.857]  No one's trying to smear Black Lives Matter.
[02:28:16.917 --> 02:28:18.679]  Black Lives Matter smeared themselves.
[02:28:19.079 --> 02:28:23.163]  We're connecting the two because we're seeing identical behavior.
[02:28:23.523 --> 02:28:25.044]  And definitions change.
[02:28:25.104 --> 02:28:31.230]  Whether people like it or not, the definition of what Black Lives Matter is as a movement has changed because of its actions.
[02:28:31.650 --> 02:28:43.073]  A lot of people will say, if I tell a woman who is acting sexist towards a man that she's acting feminist, people will be outraged, but quite frankly, that's what sex is like now, so I'm in a connection.
[02:28:43.494 --> 02:28:45.354]  Same thing with BLM kidnapping.
[02:28:46.074 --> 02:28:54.757]  People maybe need to stop asking questions of what has Black Lives Matter done to be compared to this, rather than what has the right done.
[02:28:56.854 --> 02:29:00.575]  I mean, even the shooting of the TV reporter, you remember that?
[02:29:00.595 --> 02:29:03.456]  I think it was back in late 2015, early 2016.
[02:29:03.936 --> 02:29:07.557]  Bryce Williams, he gunned down that TV reporter live on air.
[02:29:07.917 --> 02:29:11.818]  He said that that was part of an agenda to inflame a race war.
[02:29:12.218 --> 02:29:16.119]  You know, again, we had Ishmael Brinsley, he said it was a Black Lives Matter revenge attack.
[02:29:16.539 --> 02:29:19.521]  We had demonstrators chanting for, what do we want?
[02:29:19.621 --> 02:29:20.241]  Dead cops.
[02:29:20.321 --> 02:29:21.182]  When do we want it now?
[02:29:21.402 --> 02:29:22.242]  Oh, what did they get?
[02:29:22.383 --> 02:29:23.143]  Dead cops.
[02:29:23.643 --> 02:29:28.106]  Direct correlation between their ideology and violence.
[02:29:28.446 --> 02:29:35.350]  So yes, we're obviously going to make the connection if they're screaming in his face, F white people, F Donald Trump.
[02:29:35.811 --> 02:29:41.034]  The narrative, the rhetoric that's directly associated with Black Lives Matter over and over again.
[02:29:41.314 --> 02:29:47.156]  Who's ideological guru, who's inspiration is a convicted cop-killing terrorist, by the way, Assata Shakur.
[02:29:47.496 --> 02:29:51.677]  So we're gonna make the connection, no matter how offended you get about our tweet.
[02:29:51.777 --> 02:29:54.698]  We'll be back live on the Alex Jones Show with Lauren Southern.
[02:29:55.118 --> 02:29:55.718]  Don't go away.
[02:29:59.039 --> 02:29:59.959]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.439 --> 02:30:02.060]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:05.661]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.334 --> 02:30:14.216]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:14.496 --> 02:30:21.799]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:30:21.959 --> 02:30:32.983]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:30:33.423 --> 02:30:40.949]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[02:30:41.229 --> 02:30:50.576]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:30:50.896 --> 02:30:55.061]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:30:55.321 --> 02:31:02.069]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:03.571]  That means it's clean.
[02:31:03.871 --> 02:31:04.912]  That means it's pure.
[02:31:05.032 --> 02:31:07.776]  That's infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:31:07.936 --> 02:31:09.618]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:15.942]  There is a crisis in America today.
[02:31:16.402 --> 02:31:18.805]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[02:31:19.106 --> 02:31:26.514]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[02:31:26.915 --> 02:31:30.539]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:32.021]  I have the answer for you today.
[02:31:32.421 --> 02:31:33.563]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[02:31:34.315 --> 02:31:37.297]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone, and it's safe.
[02:31:37.917 --> 02:31:39.618]  No radiation compartment.
[02:31:40.059 --> 02:31:45.842]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[02:31:46.643 --> 02:31:49.105]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[02:31:49.305 --> 02:31:55.268]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[02:31:56.049 --> 02:31:57.731]  With a block-it pocket, this is impossible.
[02:31:58.171 --> 02:32:00.853]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[02:32:01.174 --> 02:32:05.758]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own block-it pocket.
[02:32:10.296 --> 02:32:16.722]  The brutal torture of a special needs man was live streamed on Facebook as he was bound and gagged in Chicago.
[02:32:16.742 --> 02:32:22.848]  Now in the video, several people in the apartment that took him could be seen laughing and eating during Tuesday night's attack.
[02:32:22.988 --> 02:32:25.570]  The victim was viciously beaten and had been kidnapped.
[02:32:25.671 --> 02:32:32.457]  Now at least four of the alleged captors were taken into custody on Wednesday after their footage began making the rounds on social media.
[02:32:32.597 --> 02:32:40.384]  Now, the footage showed the attackers cutting the victim's hair until his scalp bled, slashing his clothes, and reportedly slapping him as they ashed cigarettes on him.
[02:32:40.525 --> 02:32:43.808]  They also forced him to say, F Donald Trump, F white people.
[02:32:44.008 --> 02:32:48.552]  One of the suspects could be her telling the man in the video, instructing him to denounce Donald Trump.
[02:32:48.652 --> 02:32:51.235]  Now, this was live streamed for roughly 30 minutes.
[02:32:51.475 --> 02:32:55.679]  One of the captors told the special needs man, kiss the floor with an expletive.
[02:32:55.859 --> 02:32:56.720]  Nobody can help you.
[02:32:56.940 --> 02:33:02.004]  The strange part of this video, later on in it, someone urges the man to say, I love black people.
[02:33:02.164 --> 02:33:06.748]  It should be pointed out that all of his captors were in fact black, and he was a white special needs person.
[02:33:06.988 --> 02:33:09.410]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:33:12.392 --> 02:33:13.473]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:13.713 --> 02:33:17.115]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:32.563 --> 02:33:35.684]  We're live with Lauren Southern of TheRebel.media.
[02:33:35.724 --> 02:33:42.665]  We're going to tell you how you can get her book coming up, Barbarians, How Baby Boomers, Immigrants and Islam Screwed My Generation.
[02:33:43.265 --> 02:33:49.626]  But just rounding off with this BLM issue, of course the kidnapping, torture of an 18-year-old white kid there in Chicago.
[02:33:50.206 --> 02:34:00.148]  The leftist media more offended over my tweets than the actual 48-hour torture and abuse of a mentally incapacitated young man.
[02:34:01.397 --> 02:34:07.722]  Lauren, we've seen this rash of fake hate crimes by leftists, Islamists, BLM supporters.
[02:34:08.303 --> 02:34:13.667]  Do you think they're, you know, hoaxing these hate crimes just to try and demonise Trump supporters?
[02:34:14.067 --> 02:34:18.631]  Or is this some kind of weird new form of virtue signalling that we're seeing here?
[02:34:21.053 --> 02:34:22.173]  I'm sure it's a bit of both.
[02:34:37.358 --> 02:34:37.438]  It's
[02:34:54.917 --> 02:35:00.019]  Good and decent things that make discourse, political discourse in our society function properly.
[02:35:00.339 --> 02:35:02.840]  We can't solve race issues in America.
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:13.484]  They are being lied about and exaggerated on one end and totally misrepresented because of these people that are obsessed with virtue signaling and obsessed with their narrative.
[02:35:13.524 --> 02:35:19.726]  And quite frankly, they're going to lose if they continue this narrative because people are being exposed to the truth.
[02:35:21.556 --> 02:35:24.017]  Now let's move on to a slightly different issue.
[02:35:24.257 --> 02:35:32.420]  Same group of deranged morons, but you posted this thing, I think it's from Tumblr, you posted this a couple of days ago up on Twitter.
[02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:34.221]  Clovergender!
[02:35:35.911 --> 02:35:42.115]  Someone claiming their identity remains stuck at the mental age of a 13-year-old, according to this post.
[02:35:42.575 --> 02:35:47.118]  So that gives them the justification to embrace their sexual attraction to children.
[02:35:47.158 --> 02:35:48.959]  I mean, that's what I got out of it.
[02:35:49.319 --> 02:36:03.768]  Before you came on, we talked about a new Fox entertainment show where they had a six-year-old boy who is transgender with a sadomasochistic ball gag in his mouth talking about his vagina.
[02:36:04.844 --> 02:36:07.849]  We've got Clover Gender, whatever the hell that is.
[02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:11.474]  Why is the left attempting to normalise paedophilia?
[02:36:11.494 --> 02:36:12.556]  We see this again and again.
[02:36:12.656 --> 02:36:17.042]  Todd Nickerson, Salon.com are cracked talking about child porn.
[02:36:17.463 --> 02:36:19.886]  Why are they trying to normalise paedophilia?
[02:36:21.534 --> 02:36:22.375]  Right.
[02:36:22.535 --> 02:36:28.818]  Well, Clovergender, I'm not surprised, I wouldn't be surprised if it were real when you have people identifying as six-year-olds and whatnot.
[02:36:29.058 --> 02:36:37.002]  That one may have specifically been a troll, but it does expose what the logical conclusion of a lot of leftist ideology is.
[02:36:37.563 --> 02:36:44.546]  And you know what's funny is that a lot of SOCON, despite how ridiculed they are, they tend to be, they've been right about a lot of things.
[02:36:44.847 --> 02:36:49.109]  They said after gay marriage was normalized that you'd get transgenderism normalized.
[02:36:49.469 --> 02:36:53.951]  And then after transgenderism, you have pedophilia normalized, and what do you know?
[02:36:54.011 --> 02:36:56.633]  It's kind of happening in order quite a bit.
[02:36:56.753 --> 02:37:00.715]  And we've got a society that they kind of, they get bored.
[02:37:00.735 --> 02:37:07.959]  They have normal sex and they get bored of that, so they need something more interesting and more interesting, and the porn gets more and more messed up.
[02:37:08.599 --> 02:37:26.912]  The sexual lives and fantasies of celebrities that are exposed on TV get more and more messed up, and our whole culture, instead of being about morals, decency, moderation, being a person that has willpower to behave properly, it's just become about more, more, more, more.
[02:37:26.953 --> 02:37:31.035]  It's addicted to hedonism, and this is the logical conclusion of that hedonism.
[02:37:31.176 --> 02:37:35.639]  It's extremely messed up and based entirely on what I want now and not what is moral.
[02:37:37.762 --> 02:37:47.849]  And again, this really started back in the late 60s where you had the foundation of sexual theology, the people who kind of became the authorities on human sexual behaviour.
[02:37:47.889 --> 02:37:48.829]  I talked about it earlier.
[02:37:48.970 --> 02:37:53.413]  Alfred Kinsey, people like that, they were actually complete perverts.
[02:37:53.953 --> 02:37:57.095]  It's like going to Freud for all your psychology information.
[02:37:57.135 --> 02:37:59.717]  He was a complete nutcase, crack addict.
[02:38:00.317 --> 02:38:14.088]  Alfred Kinsey was a complete pervert, did horrific experiments on children, again to try and prove something that wasn't true, that basically we're all completely perverted, we're all into this, and again to legitimize pedophilia, and that's why you see it in the shows now.
[02:38:14.108 --> 02:38:25.077]  So you go back to the very foundation of sexual theology after the sexual liberation of the 60s, and it was perverts laying down the law of what was normal.
[02:38:25.737 --> 02:38:29.980]  When what's normal to them is very different from what's normal to the rest of us.
[02:38:32.042 --> 02:38:35.164]  Yeah, and people need to start having conversations about this again.
[02:38:35.204 --> 02:38:38.727]  I know it's kind of become a untouchable subject.
[02:38:38.747 --> 02:38:54.278]  You'll be branded as the pastor from Footloose if you try to talk about sexuality or sexual freedom at all and talk about maybe the fact that it has some problems and maybe the fact that we should talk about some limits on it because it can get pretty messed up.
[02:38:54.338 --> 02:38:54.559]  I mean,
[02:38:55.379 --> 02:39:06.212]  I was tweeting Ariana Grande the other day who, as many people know, she twerks on a stage and sings about sex for a living and she was talking about how she was infuriated about being objectified.
[02:39:06.272 --> 02:39:10.317]  Well, you can't have your cake and eat it too.
[02:39:10.377 --> 02:39:12.439]  You can't run around in no clothing and also
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:13.820]  I think
[02:39:32.903 --> 02:39:53.667]  This double-think, maybe it exists in the classrooms of gender studies teachers, but it doesn't exist in reality and we really need to have an honest discussion about the sexualization in our culture and in media and especially towards children, which I don't understand why but is becoming, well I guess I do understand why to an extent, but it's becoming so prevalent, I mean, among politicians.
[02:39:53.707 --> 02:39:58.548]  I'm hearing about it more and more and it's extremely disturbing and we need to have an honest conversation about it.
[02:40:00.069 --> 02:40:08.257]  I mean, people were predicting 30, 40 years ago that the last barrier would be the normalization of pedophilia and now we see it.
[02:40:08.277 --> 02:40:12.481]  We see it with salon.com, Todd Nickerson giving all those pedophiles a platform.
[02:40:12.622 --> 02:40:15.865]  It's really starting to happen and it's absolutely chilling.
[02:40:16.225 --> 02:40:17.767]  Let's talk about feminism though.
[02:40:18.267 --> 02:40:19.488]  We've got about five minutes left.
[02:40:20.421 --> 02:40:24.063]  You know, you came on the scene with your strident opposition to feminism.
[02:40:24.223 --> 02:40:40.814]  I think it's fair to say that over the past, what, year or so, you know, this third wave modern feminism movement seems to have lost quite a bit of its confidence in the face of somebody, some opposition figures, actually having an argument against it.
[02:40:41.415 --> 02:40:45.878]  It's kind of morphed into other facets of social justice derangement.
[02:40:46.638 --> 02:40:52.541]  Do you think we've actually had a quantifiable victory, you know, in transforming the word feminist into a pejorative term?
[02:40:52.561 --> 02:41:01.346]  Because I don't really see a lot of the strident feminism stuff that we saw back in, you know, late 2014 throughout 2015 when you came on the scene.
[02:41:01.727 --> 02:41:07.470]  Do you think we really had a big victory against third wave feminism in discrediting it amongst young women?
[02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:09.882]  I absolutely do.
[02:41:10.022 --> 02:41:16.291]  However, I think it's been mostly among the politically educated class that we've had an influence with.
[02:41:17.012 --> 02:41:24.603]  I rarely see political YouTubers left-wing or right-wing supporting feminism anymore, and when it comes to the politically engaged community online,
[02:41:25.584 --> 02:41:28.426]  It's really, you're hard-pressed to find feminists anymore.
[02:41:28.446 --> 02:41:48.983]  However, I do feel like I might be in my little bubble of politically aware people sometimes, because as soon as you engage the wider world, the celebrity-obsessed, drama-obsessed, makeup-obsessed, Kardashians-obsessed world, a lot of them are still just there to regurgitate the talking points of those celebrities.
[02:41:49.063 --> 02:41:54.708]  So, as long as those celebrities are owned by Marxists, as long as they're paid by Marxists and leftists,
[02:41:55.308 --> 02:42:15.621]  You will still see feminism having a large influence on the popular, not so much politically engaged culture that are just there to vote for politicians because of their hair, to back up immigration because it's trendy, to love feminism and tout feminism because Katy Perry said so or whichever celebrity it is during that week.
[02:42:17.352 --> 02:42:36.739]  And of course, the way they control this paradigm is the very few celebrities who dare step outside the box, who, by the way, some of whom message me privately on a regular basis and say, I completely agree with you, but I can't say anything publicly because it would ruin my career in five minutes.
[02:42:37.319 --> 02:42:47.327]  Many big people who private message me saying that, who we'd like to get on as guests but they don't want to do it, because they know the left is completely intolerant of other people's opinions and would crucify them.
[02:42:47.747 --> 02:42:58.155]  As soon as any of them, and it's rare when it happens, step outside of their comfort zone and actually criticise feminism, God forbid, they are absolutely savaged.
[02:42:58.555 --> 02:43:06.301]  The most rampant misogyny amongst the left is reserved for women who critique third-wave feminism, right?
[02:43:07.597 --> 02:43:11.018]  Yeah, I think the actress, was it Kaylee?
[02:43:11.518 --> 02:43:18.961]  I can't remember her last name, but she's from Big Bang Theory, and she said something about not being a feminist, and she was just ravaged by the media.
[02:43:18.981 --> 02:43:21.562]  And that's exactly how it works.
[02:43:21.922 --> 02:43:23.822]  You step out of line, your career is over.
[02:43:23.922 --> 02:43:26.663]  And it's hard to blame some of these people.
[02:43:26.783 --> 02:43:31.225]  I get you've got work to do, you've got a job, this is your entire life, but at the same time,
[02:43:32.205 --> 02:43:33.106]  What is really important?
[02:43:33.206 --> 02:43:35.087]  Is this culture war important to you?
[02:43:35.127 --> 02:43:37.008]  Is the future of the West important to you?
[02:43:37.028 --> 02:43:38.609]  Or is your career important?
[02:43:39.090 --> 02:43:48.256]  And unfortunately, I think for a lot of celebrities, they're going to pick their career and their own life and Instagram popularity over the culture war.
[02:43:48.736 --> 02:43:54.880]  Luckily, there are a lot of us fighting in the culture war, like yourself, InfoWars, Rebel Media, Breitbart, and all the rest.
[02:43:56.201 --> 02:44:00.723]  I think we're going to have to maybe change our strategy a little bit to have a proper influence.
[02:44:01.024 --> 02:44:17.693]  You have YouTubers like Blair White who are kind of taking on the whole snap-snap Beyonce attitude to entice younger generations into more logical political discussion, but with a little bit of the flair of mainstream makeup and attitude.
[02:44:17.753 --> 02:44:23.796]  So we might have to change our tactics, but it's going to be a tough culture war against this.
[02:44:25.978 --> 02:44:27.720]  I'm seeing some signs of encouragement.
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:35.526]  I'm seeing more people, a lot of younger people, teenagers and so forth coming out and saying, you know, I'm just sick of it.
[02:44:35.566 --> 02:44:37.268]  I'm just going to come out and say what I want to say.
[02:44:37.308 --> 02:44:38.108]  I don't care anymore.
[02:44:38.128 --> 02:44:44.934]  I'm seeing people grow balls on a more regular basis and I think that can only be positive for encouraging more dialogue and action.
[02:44:44.974 --> 02:44:47.575]  Actual diversity of opinion, which the left hates.
[02:44:48.055 --> 02:44:51.156]  But finally, you've got a new book out, Barbarians.
[02:44:51.676 --> 02:44:52.576]  Sounds very ominous.
[02:44:52.977 --> 02:44:56.178]  How baby boomers, immigrants and Islam screwed my generation.
[02:44:57.158 --> 02:45:00.519]  What motivated you to write this book and what subjects does it cover?
[02:45:02.455 --> 02:45:11.463]  Well, the whole idea of the book is to talk about youth and millennials and the kind of dispossession of the Western soul.
[02:45:11.764 --> 02:45:22.514]  And a lot of the questions that young people have that are leading them to become alt-right, that are leading them to become identitarians, nationalists, all these things, it's because they're not having their questions answered.
[02:45:22.574 --> 02:45:25.957]  And these groups are not going to go away until they have these questions answered.
[02:45:26.557 --> 02:45:30.079]  Can society live in a multicultural world?
[02:45:30.139 --> 02:45:31.680]  Does multiculturalism work?
[02:45:32.060 --> 02:45:34.341]  Can we have such massive immigration?
[02:45:34.461 --> 02:45:37.583]  How are we going to fix race relations?
[02:45:38.023 --> 02:45:41.805]  Was it such a good idea to give up some of these older traditions we have?
[02:45:41.845 --> 02:45:49.109]  And I talk about the people who have suppressed the answers to these questions and have tried to silence this generation.
[02:45:49.129 --> 02:45:54.311]  And quite frankly, it's just a book that's trying to address a lot of the
[02:45:55.777 --> 02:46:01.123]  Lost Millennials that are searching in the dark for meaning, purpose, and a political ideology.
[02:46:01.183 --> 02:46:05.688]  Because right now, the mainstream media certainly are not giving them the answers they're looking for.
[02:46:05.708 --> 02:46:09.812]  Now, how are the reviews going on Amazon?
[02:46:09.832 --> 02:46:14.677]  Because I know a tactic of the intolerant left is to go and flood and sabotage the reviews.
[02:46:14.697 --> 02:46:17.601]  Have you managed to fend off that mode of attack?
[02:46:18.996 --> 02:46:20.718]  Right, well right now it's looking pretty good.
[02:46:20.998 --> 02:46:28.166]  Luckily, all of the reviews that are purchased reviews, the people who have actually gone and read the book, are extremely positive.
[02:46:28.206 --> 02:46:29.207]  Four or five stars.
[02:46:29.487 --> 02:46:35.514]  It's the reviews that haven't bought the book that I'm finding it's one star in just the sentences.
[02:46:35.874 --> 02:46:37.695]  This is racist below it.
[02:46:37.815 --> 02:46:42.278]  I think they just read the title, but I thought we told people not to judge books by the cover.
[02:46:42.338 --> 02:46:47.321]  Apparently leftists didn't get the memo, but luckily I'm doing pretty good on reviews at the moment.
[02:46:47.361 --> 02:46:49.703]  Thank you to my lovely followers and readers.
[02:46:51.504 --> 02:46:55.767]  Okay, just in closing, tell Pete obviously they can get the book on Amazon.com.
[02:46:55.867 --> 02:46:57.748]  Is there a Kindle version?
[02:46:57.808 --> 02:46:58.889]  Is there going to be an audiobook?
[02:47:00.586 --> 02:47:07.489]  Yes, you can pick up the Kindle version on the same Amazon page, and you can go to barbariansbook.com to find both of those.
[02:47:07.989 --> 02:47:10.290]  And I will be making an audiobook, I'll get around to that.
[02:47:10.510 --> 02:47:12.891]  Eventually, it's been a busy New Year so far.
[02:47:13.391 --> 02:47:17.993]  But stay tuned and follow me on Twitter, at WarnOtherSchoolSouthern, to see when that comes around.
[02:47:19.438 --> 02:47:22.180]  Okay, we'll leave it there for now and be sure to have you back on the show.
[02:47:22.541 --> 02:47:24.442]  There goes Lauren Southern.
[02:47:24.482 --> 02:47:25.703]  Thanks for joining us, Lauren.
[02:47:25.723 --> 02:47:29.947]  We're going to dip back into the news now in this final three minutes.
[02:47:30.528 --> 02:47:36.933]  Let's switch to cultural enrichment, which we're given a plentiful supply of in Europe on a daily basis.
[02:47:37.313 --> 02:47:38.695]  The London Telegraph reports
[02:47:39.375 --> 02:47:45.999]  Almost 1,000 cars torched around France on New Year's Eve, but government insists it went particularly well.
[02:47:46.019 --> 02:47:48.420]  Well, where have we heard that before in Cologne?
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:54.883]  Vandals in France torched 945 parked cars on New Year's Eve in an arson rampage.
[02:47:55.264 --> 02:47:57.385]  That has become a sinister annual tradition.
[02:47:57.785 --> 02:48:00.727]  Amid a row over the weather, government sought to play down the figures.
[02:48:00.767 --> 02:48:02.508]  According to the French Interior Ministry,
[02:48:03.148 --> 02:48:13.351]  The total of 945, which included cars that were either totally destroyed or more likely affected, amounted to a 17% rise compared to last year.
[02:48:13.711 --> 02:48:17.252]  Despite this, New Year's Eve went off without any major incident.
[02:48:17.292 --> 02:48:24.013]  The Interior Ministry insisted in a statement, adding that there were only a few troubles with public order.
[02:48:24.594 --> 02:48:25.554]  So basically they've
[02:48:26.414 --> 02:48:32.759]  Stopped counting cars that are set on fire as a result of other cars being set on fire to try and reduce the number.
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:36.022]  This is now an annual tradition in France.
[02:48:36.362 --> 02:48:37.663]  In which areas is it happening?
[02:48:37.804 --> 02:48:40.226]  Oh yeah, it's the immigrant ghettos.
[02:48:40.286 --> 02:48:41.327]  2005 French riots.
[02:48:41.787 --> 02:48:45.010]  Again, hundreds, perhaps even thousands of cars torched.
[02:48:45.390 --> 02:48:47.312]  This is what they do.
[02:48:47.972 --> 02:48:49.012]  We see it in Sweden.
[02:48:49.172 --> 02:48:50.253]  We see it in Malmo.
[02:48:50.693 --> 02:48:56.654]  We see the New Year's Eve celebrations in Germany also, where they literally throw fireworks at each other.
[02:48:57.514 --> 02:48:59.515]  They don't only attack police officers.
[02:48:59.535 --> 02:49:05.156]  They don't only attack ambulance workers and firemen when they're actually trying to help people who are injured.
[02:49:05.596 --> 02:49:08.057]  They just throw fireworks at random people.
[02:49:08.617 --> 02:49:15.839]  This is the cultural enrichment that the West is currently enjoying, thanks to mass immigration.
[02:49:16.519 --> 02:49:17.439]  Breitbart reports,
[02:49:18.655 --> 02:49:24.401]  Revealed 1,000 man mob attack, police set Germany's oldest church alight on, you guessed it, New Year's Eve.
[02:49:25.222 --> 02:49:34.931]  At New Year's Eve celebrations in Dortmund, a mob of more than 1,000 men chanted Allah Akbar, launched fireworks at police and set fire to a historic church.
[02:49:35.132 --> 02:49:40.997]  Already by 7pm, a man was hospitalised with first degree burns to his face, cultural enrichment,
[02:49:41.758 --> 02:49:51.407]  After fireworks were hurled at a group of homeless people outside the city's main train station, which is usually where they all congregate because that's where the migrant camps are located.
[02:49:51.888 --> 02:49:56.753]  More than two dozen people were injured at festivities in Dortmund, some seriously.
[02:49:57.573 --> 02:49:59.115]  But what did the police say about it?
[02:49:59.275 --> 02:50:00.636]  Well, imagine my shock once again.
[02:50:01.237 --> 02:50:03.419]  The events of the night were described as quiet,
[02:50:04.881 --> 02:50:10.251]  By the police in a statement and as normal by a spokesman for the city government.
[02:50:10.773 --> 02:50:13.498]  So again, you have a direct correlation between violent crime...
[02:50:14.773 --> 02:50:16.975]  Absolute bedlam in the case of Malmo.
[02:50:16.995 --> 02:50:18.215]  We played the video before.
[02:50:18.776 --> 02:50:23.879]  On the streets of major European cities, cars being set alight, throwing fireworks at each other.
[02:50:24.199 --> 02:50:30.744]  They even started throwing grenades at apartment blocks and people's houses in some cases.
[02:50:31.244 --> 02:50:36.428]  But because the police just deny it, and you can see the video there, we're playing that out of Malmo.
[02:50:37.248 --> 02:50:44.053]  Because the police just deny it, or because they don't count certain crime figures, they can just say that it's a non-issue.
[02:50:45.154 --> 02:50:51.239]  And that all these immigrants are just completely peacefully integrating into Western society and we don't have any problems whatsoever.
[02:50:51.540 --> 02:50:56.645]  The reality for the people who live there is very, very different.
[02:50:57.445 --> 02:51:00.668]  We'll be back with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:51:01.189 --> 02:51:03.451]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:51:03.471 --> 02:51:04.012]  Don't go away.
[02:51:14.611 --> 02:51:26.076]  Fifteen years ago, after, oh, nineteen years as a reporter, it was clear to me that fake news was everywhere.
[02:51:26.917 --> 02:51:36.361]  And I wasn't talking about independent media, or so-called alternative media, I was talking about mainstream media, right from the beginning.
[02:51:37.802 --> 02:51:40.343]  That's where all the fake news was.
[02:51:41.343 --> 02:51:43.384]  So, hence, no more fake news.
[02:51:44.144 --> 02:51:58.069]  Somehow, these fake news sites, the Washington Post and other media outlets said, and they're now all getting on the bandwagon, these fake news sites, you see, are connected to... Russia.
[02:51:59.990 --> 02:52:00.390]  Why?
[02:52:01.891 --> 02:52:02.931]  What are we talking about here?
[02:52:04.697 --> 02:52:12.884]  100,000 fake news sites and bloggers that are somehow covertly working with the Russian government?
[02:52:14.045 --> 02:52:18.428]  I mean, the story was so preposterous on its face.
[02:52:19.449 --> 02:52:21.691]  What are they even talking about?
[02:52:22.332 --> 02:52:27.476]  As my first logic teacher told us in class so many moons ago,
[02:52:28.989 --> 02:52:39.139]  The biggest weapon of non-logic and people who want to avoid rationality is the generality, the vague generality.
[02:52:40.060 --> 02:52:48.747]  Russia, fake news sites, fake news bloggers, oh yeah, it all stirs up in a pot, see, a gigantic pot.
[02:52:49.188 --> 02:52:51.030]  What does that mean, Russian hack?
[02:52:52.071 --> 02:52:54.433]  Well, of course, the implication is, in fact,
[02:52:55.965 --> 02:53:04.315]  That they did go into the machines, that they did go into the software, that they subverted the vote, that they changed the numbers, the actual numbers in the election.
[02:53:04.335 --> 02:53:08.219]  That's what the phrase, hack the election, said.
[02:53:08.860 --> 02:53:13.025]  To break it down, major media were basically saying, okay look,
[02:53:16.025 --> 02:53:25.870]  Russia hacked the Podesta, the Hillary, the DNC emails, and fed them to WikiLeaks.
[02:53:26.811 --> 02:53:36.856]  And then WikiLeaks released them, and then all of these fake news sites jumped on board and began splashing this all over the Internet.
[02:53:38.117 --> 02:53:38.337]  Now,
[02:53:39.634 --> 02:53:46.741]  If you talk to the editor of the Washington Post and you try to nail them down and say, this is what you're talking about, now this is it?
[02:53:47.281 --> 02:53:50.104]  This is exactly what you mean and you don't mean anything else?
[02:53:50.184 --> 02:53:51.525]  No, we mean a lot of things.
[02:53:52.206 --> 02:53:55.308]  Don't try to pin me down, there's a whole lot of stuff going on here.
[02:53:55.448 --> 02:53:56.149]  Oh yeah, okay.
[02:53:56.850 --> 02:53:58.311]  And I know these people are fake.
[02:53:59.012 --> 02:54:01.854]  I've known it for 30 years that they're fake.
[02:54:02.535 --> 02:54:05.958]  And now they're basically saying, hey look at us, we're fake.
[02:54:34.161 --> 02:54:42.408]  We are live for the final segment of the Alex Jones Show before we hit a few final news stories.
[02:54:43.048 --> 02:54:48.433]  Last call for the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative with Brainforce.
[02:54:48.533 --> 02:54:49.434]  Here it is, 30% off again.
[02:54:51.315 --> 02:54:56.099]  I take this, took two before doing the show, really helps as a cognitive enhancer.
[02:54:56.599 --> 02:55:01.743]  If you're doing any kind of mental work whatsoever, really helps get those neurons firing.
[02:55:02.123 --> 02:55:03.124]  Not just a cliche.
[02:55:03.725 --> 02:55:07.507]  Google nootropics and see how this has benefited other people.
[02:55:07.588 --> 02:55:08.969]  This is the best formula.
[02:55:09.409 --> 02:55:11.771]  We've got Brain Force Plus, I believe, now in stock.
[02:55:11.791 --> 02:55:12.251]  There it is.
[02:55:12.271 --> 02:55:12.832]  30% off.
[02:55:15.282 --> 02:55:18.605]  Again, don't take more than two because this stuff is powerful.
[02:55:19.045 --> 02:55:21.327]  It really gets your neurons firing.
[02:55:21.347 --> 02:55:27.572]  It has the vitamin B6, vitamin B12, the alpha GPC.
[02:55:27.752 --> 02:55:29.754]  That is one of the best ingredients in there.
[02:55:30.275 --> 02:55:31.616]  Again, it's a nootropic.
[02:55:32.376 --> 02:55:33.197]  It's cutting edge.
[02:55:33.417 --> 02:55:34.458]  Google nootropics.
[02:55:35.018 --> 02:55:36.340]  This isn't pseudoscience.
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:37.841]  This is really helping people.
[02:55:38.441 --> 02:55:40.903]  All the whiz kids in Silicon Valley are taking this.
[02:55:41.824 --> 02:55:56.360]  And we have Brain Force Plus as part of the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative at 30% off at infowarslife.com as part of the extended 2017 Super Sale with all those other discounts.
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:05.563]  Super Male Vitality, Secret 12, Liver Shield, Survival Shield X2, Knockout, The Sleep Aid, Prostagard and many others at infowarslife.com.
[02:56:06.083 --> 02:56:17.728]  Supports this broadcast, supports us sending reporters out into the field at great expense to take on the mainstream media narrative directly, to get in their face, to win the argument.
[02:56:18.028 --> 02:56:19.828]  We've done it through your support.
[02:56:20.348 --> 02:56:20.729]  For what?
[02:56:20.809 --> 02:56:21.169]  Going on.
[02:56:22.750 --> 02:56:30.218]  17 years I guess it is now, probably even more than that, by selling our own products to fund our own message.
[02:56:30.879 --> 02:56:39.007]  We're only responsible to you, we're not responsible to corporate advertisers or foreign dictatorships like CNN is.
[02:56:39.888 --> 02:56:41.049]  Infowarslife.com
[02:56:43.134 --> 02:56:48.200]  For the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative, all those discounts have been extended.
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:50.482]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:56:51.703 --> 02:56:58.551]  Final couple of minutes, Drudge Report has gone big with the torture story of the 18-year-old mentally disabled teen in Chicago.
[02:56:58.691 --> 02:57:01.614]  Facebook Live of Hate is his headline.
[02:57:02.509 --> 02:57:04.251]  Man forced to say F. Donald Trump.
[02:57:04.291 --> 02:57:05.393]  That's the Infowars story.
[02:57:05.433 --> 02:57:06.494]  Made to drink from toilet.
[02:57:06.514 --> 02:57:07.295]  Chicago land.
[02:57:07.396 --> 02:57:07.896]  Torture.
[02:57:08.737 --> 02:57:09.238]  Hate crime.
[02:57:09.278 --> 02:57:10.099]  Battery charges.
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:14.545]  CNN's Don Lemon says he doesn't think it was evil, really.
[02:57:14.645 --> 02:57:16.848]  If the roles were reversed, what would they be saying?
[02:57:17.469 --> 02:57:28.840]  Again, they're more offended over our tweets and stories about the story than the actual racial abuse and torture of this poor 18-year-old man for 48 hours.
[02:57:29.180 --> 02:57:30.842]  Absolutely despicable.
[02:57:31.242 --> 02:57:32.643]  What do you expect from the left?
[02:57:33.584 --> 02:57:40.050]  Information Liberation reports UK state forcibly indoctrinates schoolboy for saying Muslims are trying to take over.
[02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:45.735]  That's right, he had the wrong opinion, so they forced him to go to a mosque and change his opinion.
[02:57:45.775 --> 02:57:49.958]  You see that happening in the Netherlands, school children being forced to go to a mosque.
[02:57:50.719 --> 02:57:56.344]  If their parents refused to allow that to happen, then they were investigated.
[02:57:57.927 --> 02:58:02.271]  We've also got Slovenian bishops lament chapel desecration.
[02:58:02.311 --> 02:58:03.672]  This is out of Catholic culture.
[02:58:04.152 --> 02:58:18.485]  The spokesman for the Slovenian bishops conference has issued a statement lamenting the January 2nd desecration of a mountain chapel in Slovenia, an incident in which the words Alla Akbar were sprayed on the outside walls.
[02:58:18.865 --> 02:58:21.868]  The nation of two million is 58% Catholic.
[02:58:22.709 --> 02:58:23.630]  So again, another
[02:58:25.157 --> 02:58:30.559]  Incident where cultural enrichment is invading Europe and making itself known.
[02:58:31.780 --> 02:58:38.863]  We have massive attacks going on in Germany in regards to Germany's oldest church being set alight on New Year's Eve.
[02:58:39.283 --> 02:58:40.844]  Fireworks being thrown at each other.
[02:58:41.404 --> 02:58:44.486]  This is the cultural enrichment we've been told we have to tolerate.
[02:58:45.166 --> 02:58:48.607]  Fourth Hour coming up live on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:48.627 --> 02:58:49.088]  Stay tuned.
[02:58:50.208 --> 02:58:51.669]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:59:00.001 --> 02:59:09.024]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:09.084 --> 02:59:17.266]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:17.506 --> 02:59:22.189]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:22.369 --> 02:59:29.093]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:29.173 --> 02:59:36.258]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:36.338 --> 02:59:43.202]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:43.362 --> 02:59:47.724]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:47.844 --> 02:59:51.106]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:51.226 --> 02:59:57.370]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:57.530 --> 02:59:59.751]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:00:01.112 --> 03:00:07.035]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.070 --> 03:00:16.957]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:00:19.039 --> 03:00:25.106]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[03:00:25.146 --> 03:00:28.149]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.209 --> 03:00:31.433]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[03:00:33.219 --> 03:00:36.601]  Is Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones?
[03:00:36.641 --> 03:00:41.285]  Gonna hit a few more final news stories with Anthony Camilla coming up next.
[03:00:41.325 --> 03:00:42.926]  This is out of Breitbart.com.
[03:00:43.106 --> 03:00:43.886]  Fake news!
[03:00:44.047 --> 03:00:50.331]  USA Today issues correction after falsely branding Milo as white nationalist alt-right.
[03:00:51.052 --> 03:00:55.135]  USA Today issued a correction to their recent article about Breitbart senior editor
[03:00:55.768 --> 03:01:00.331]  Milo Yiannopoulos after falsely labelling him a white nationalist and racist.
[03:01:00.972 --> 03:01:14.682]  So basically Milo came out with this book deal last week, a $250,000 advance from the publisher Simon & Schuster, and that set off a chain of butthurt like you've never seen before.
[03:01:15.223 --> 03:01:20.547]  Now, Milo couldn't possibly welcome that as publicity for his upcoming book, right?
[03:01:21.351 --> 03:01:21.531]  No.
[03:01:21.932 --> 03:01:22.872]  But they fell for it.
[03:01:23.112 --> 03:01:24.153]  They fell for the trap.
[03:01:24.554 --> 03:01:26.495]  The outrage mobs appeared once again.
[03:01:27.216 --> 03:01:30.938]  Simon & Schuster didn't back down, at least the US branch of it didn't.
[03:01:31.479 --> 03:01:32.179]  Credit to them.
[03:01:32.460 --> 03:01:35.362]  And he's got a ton of free publicity for his book.
[03:01:35.862 --> 03:01:39.005]  So, well done leftists, you failed once again.
[03:01:40.410 --> 03:01:45.393]  So now, USA Today had to come out and say, well actually no, he's not a white nationalist.
[03:01:45.713 --> 03:01:46.833]  He's not a racist.
[03:01:47.214 --> 03:01:52.917]  Which if you know about Milo's personal life, which he brags about on a regular basis, then you know that that's true.
[03:01:54.062 --> 03:01:58.825]  Campus Reform reports Trump is Hitler, says Wayne State VP.
[03:01:58.885 --> 03:02:00.465]  It's a perfectly reasonable opinion.
[03:02:00.545 --> 03:02:03.227]  Once again, that isn't completely deranged, is it?
[03:02:03.707 --> 03:02:14.973]  A Wayne State University vice president is on an anti-Trump posting binge on his social media account declaring that Trump is a Nazi and his supporters are comfortable with bigotry.
[03:02:15.493 --> 03:02:16.174]  So once again,
[03:02:17.250 --> 03:02:21.253]  This is the Trump derangement syndrome rearing its ugly head once again.
[03:02:21.633 --> 03:02:25.556]  This is the syndrome that legitimized those riots that we saw in Chicago.
[03:02:25.896 --> 03:02:32.120]  The riots that crashed every single Trump event throughout 2015, throughout 2016.
[03:02:33.721 --> 03:02:36.664]  Remember the guy who got up on stage and tried to attack Trump?
[03:02:36.684 --> 03:02:39.766]  The next day he was on CNN being lionized.
[03:02:40.806 --> 03:02:41.467]  Flip that around.
[03:02:41.507 --> 03:02:45.350]  Imagine if some alt-right person had tried to physically attack Hillary Clinton.
[03:02:46.331 --> 03:02:49.492]  The hand-wringing would be like you've never seen before.
[03:02:50.793 --> 03:02:51.834]  But the left does it.
[03:02:52.254 --> 03:02:56.816]  The left can engage in violent intolerance, and it's trendy, it's liberal.
[03:02:57.276 --> 03:03:11.583]  You create that kind of environment, you create the very kind of environment that legitimizes the brutal, racist torture of an 18-year-old mentally disabled man in Chicago, which we saw just a couple of days ago.
[03:03:13.203 --> 03:03:14.004]  RT reports
[03:03:14.895 --> 03:03:16.037]  This is an ominous headline.
[03:03:16.057 --> 03:03:20.803]  The internet will shut down for 24 hours in 2017, causing financial markets to crash!
[03:03:21.906 --> 03:03:29.009]  Millions of computer users across the world could be blocked from the internet this year as the global network will shut down for 24 hours.
[03:03:29.929 --> 03:03:31.910]  This is a prediction by the U.S.
[03:03:31.930 --> 03:03:46.735]  technology security vendor, Logarithm, and it's coming from the company's chief information security officer, James Carter, who told Business Insider it won't just be a technical issue stopping people from uploading their selfies on Instagram.
[03:03:47.796 --> 03:03:51.358]  He said, quote, in 2017 we're going to see it hit big time somewhere.
[03:03:51.398 --> 03:03:55.221]  If the internet goes down, financial markets will tank.
[03:03:55.921 --> 03:04:01.905]  According to Carter, there were signs in 2016 with criminals testing missiles by shooting them into the ocean.
[03:04:02.745 --> 03:04:12.952]  He goes on to talk about, quote, if you can prove that you can take down massive sites and a large chunk of the US internet for a few hours, a 24-hour outage seems pretty easy to do.
[03:04:13.652 --> 03:04:21.157]  He's also talking about fake news will only get worse this year with hackers targeting major media sites.
[03:04:22.098 --> 03:04:30.603]  So again, they're going to have hackers, whether that's authentic, whether that's organic or not, take down big mainstream media news websites.
[03:04:30.944 --> 03:04:33.866]  The frothing outrage and sheer panic
[03:04:34.875 --> 03:04:48.379]  ...will ensue, and then of course CNN will blame InfoWars because they put us on giant McCarthyite blacklists that they then have to back away from because they can't vouch for the validity of them, as the Washington Post said.
[03:04:49.159 --> 03:04:51.920]  But again, as long as they can engage in that guilt by association...
[03:04:52.700 --> 03:05:03.410]  Anything like that will be blamed on us, and it will be used as a pretext for more censorship on Facebook, for more censorship of free information under the guise of fighting fake news.
[03:05:03.450 --> 03:05:04.671]  That's going to wrap up this segment.
[03:05:04.732 --> 03:05:06.773]  Anthony Comea coming up with the fourth hour.
[03:05:07.214 --> 03:05:08.875]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:05:08.895 --> 03:05:09.676]  Stay right there.
[03:05:09.716 --> 03:05:15.362]  Wars are not cheap, and a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[03:05:16.202 --> 03:05:18.963]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[03:05:19.544 --> 03:05:20.564]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[03:05:20.684 --> 03:05:22.045]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[03:05:22.685 --> 03:05:29.468]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[03:05:29.828 --> 03:05:34.150]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[03:05:34.770 --> 03:05:43.892]  That's why on major third party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[03:05:44.772 --> 03:05:56.474]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic and the world.
[03:05:56.895 --> 03:05:58.575]  We apply to the products we bring in.
[03:05:59.475 --> 03:06:05.842]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[03:06:06.462 --> 03:06:10.807]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[03:06:10.827 --> 03:06:12.108]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[03:06:12.568 --> 03:06:14.550]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[03:06:15.151 --> 03:06:15.632]  We're good to go.
[03:06:33.174 --> 03:06:34.435]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[03:06:34.876 --> 03:06:35.836]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[03:06:35.856 --> 03:06:37.498]  I dedicated myself to working out.
[03:06:37.538 --> 03:06:38.138]  I was in great shape.
[03:06:38.179 --> 03:06:39.239]  I'm dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:44.364]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[03:06:44.544 --> 03:06:46.126]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[03:06:46.146 --> 03:06:48.748]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[03:06:48.928 --> 03:06:53.634]  Now, it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing.
[03:06:54.295 --> 03:07:04.929]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, Myo-PQQ, you name it, 170-plus studies.
[03:07:04.949 --> 03:07:05.950]  We can make claims on this.
[03:07:05.970 --> 03:07:06.591]  This thing is like...
[03:07:07.632 --> 03:07:11.996]  The Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[03:07:12.817 --> 03:07:14.618]  I've got this at my fingertips at cost.
[03:07:14.698 --> 03:07:15.459]  I forget to take it.
[03:07:15.479 --> 03:07:16.420]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[03:07:16.460 --> 03:07:18.321]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[03:07:18.381 --> 03:07:20.563]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[03:07:21.043 --> 03:07:21.604]  Well, guess what?
[03:07:21.644 --> 03:07:22.885]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[03:07:23.245 --> 03:07:23.866]  It's discounted.
[03:07:24.126 --> 03:07:27.148]  Now, in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[03:07:27.168 --> 03:07:28.590]  A lot of the products we have left
[03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:33.872]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[03:07:34.252 --> 03:07:39.014]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[03:07:39.354 --> 03:07:41.354]  Super Metal Vitality, 30% off.
[03:07:41.875 --> 03:07:43.715]  Secret 12, 20% off.
[03:07:43.855 --> 03:07:45.036]  Liver Shield, 20% off.

[03:08:07.022 --> 03:08:08.142]  Make our bodies great again.
[03:08:17.064 --> 03:08:20.604]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:08:21.085 --> 03:08:22.905]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:29.722 --> 03:08:30.542]  Welcome.
[03:08:31.863 --> 03:08:33.885]  Anthony Cumia in for Alex Jones.
[03:08:34.866 --> 03:08:36.167]  Happy New Year, everybody.
[03:08:36.727 --> 03:08:37.748]  Hope you had a good one.
[03:08:38.749 --> 03:08:47.637]  My God, 2017 is just gonna be amazing, I think, under the leadership, finally some leadership.
[03:08:48.397 --> 03:08:50.059]  Of a President Trump.
[03:08:51.681 --> 03:08:57.107]  I think we've seen already how effective he can be without even being President.
[03:08:57.768 --> 03:08:59.049]  Without even being President!
[03:08:59.430 --> 03:09:06.438]  He's obviously getting companies to keep their business here in this country.
[03:09:08.817 --> 03:09:13.980]  He's put the fear of a real leader into people.
[03:09:15.421 --> 03:09:19.343]  And I think leaders from around the world are starting to see it.
[03:09:19.923 --> 03:09:22.445]  We've had eight years of Obama.
[03:09:22.725 --> 03:09:23.265]  Eight years.
[03:09:23.965 --> 03:09:33.511]  And everything that's coming out now where people are criticizing Trump can be traced back to his lack of leadership.
[03:09:34.805 --> 03:09:38.989]  I was watching the Russian hacking hearings today.
[03:09:39.229 --> 03:09:39.930]  Oh my God.
[03:09:40.370 --> 03:09:41.131]  Let me tell you something.
[03:09:41.371 --> 03:09:44.794]  Watching politicians, we got spoiled.
[03:09:45.234 --> 03:09:54.262]  We got spoiled with Donald Trump and all the stuff from the primaries and then the election and the debates that him and Hillary had.
[03:09:54.542 --> 03:09:55.503]  We got spoiled!
[03:09:55.983 --> 03:10:00.347]  We forgot what real American politics was like.
[03:10:01.128 --> 03:10:01.869]  BORING!
[03:10:02.964 --> 03:10:04.325]  Boring as hell!
[03:10:04.806 --> 03:10:21.343]  And I'm watching these hearings today and, well, Mr. Chairman, I would like to first thank you for your body of work over the many years that you have been in the blah, blah, blah... Shut up!
[03:10:22.104 --> 03:10:23.645]  I was getting nauseous!
[03:10:24.753 --> 03:10:25.593]  I'm listening to this.
[03:10:25.994 --> 03:10:32.297]  But they decided to all get together and have a hearing on this and kind of, hey, what are we going to do?
[03:10:32.737 --> 03:10:41.462]  The Russians and China and North Koreans, amongst others, Iran, they're all hacking us.
[03:10:42.042 --> 03:10:43.703]  And we don't know what to do about it.
[03:10:45.244 --> 03:10:50.046]  We heard people calling for preemptive strikes.
[03:10:50.906 --> 03:10:52.587]  Cyber strikes, if you will.
[03:10:55.310 --> 03:11:01.916]  These comments were coming from people that have no clue what cyber is.
[03:11:02.697 --> 03:11:11.906]  I'm watching some of these congressmen speaking and it's just these senators, they didn't know what they were talking about.
[03:11:12.546 --> 03:11:14.108]  They can't comprehend
[03:11:15.336 --> 03:11:25.302]  Think about your mom or your grandmother and how inept she is when it comes to, uh, cyber, computers, the phone.
[03:11:26.503 --> 03:11:30.025]  You ever see that commercial for the Jitterbug on TV?
[03:11:30.625 --> 03:11:31.646]  It's the Jitterbug!
[03:11:31.686 --> 03:11:34.748]  It's a phone with big buttons on it!
[03:11:35.348 --> 03:11:36.749]  I need big buttons!
[03:11:37.629 --> 03:11:38.790]  Uh, does it have a camera?
[03:11:39.311 --> 03:11:39.711]  How many?
[03:11:39.731 --> 03:11:42.212]  Oh, what do I need a camera for?
[03:11:42.753 --> 03:11:44.794]  I have my Kodak Instamatic!
[03:11:46.718 --> 03:11:50.540]  The Jitterbug!
[03:11:51.300 --> 03:11:54.742]  And look, they're showing people that are definitely too young to use the Jitterbug.
[03:11:55.082 --> 03:11:58.443]  But a lot of these people, they don't know what they're even talking about!
[03:11:59.123 --> 03:12:00.764]  As far as cyber goes.
[03:12:01.024 --> 03:12:02.165]  And then they're trying to say...
[03:12:03.393 --> 03:12:14.524]  Tell us what we have to do to fix a problem that governments are intruding on our classified information because they're hacking our computers.
[03:12:15.365 --> 03:12:16.646]  It was sad to watch.
[03:12:17.668 --> 03:12:26.715]  It was like that friend at a party that knows nothing about sports that tries to get into the sports conversation and you're just like, oh, shut up, you're embarrassing yourself.
[03:12:27.015 --> 03:12:28.417]  That's pretty much what it was.
[03:12:28.857 --> 03:12:30.538]  It was embarrassing to watch.
[03:12:30.758 --> 03:12:37.284]  There were a few people in there, in the hearings, that knew what they were talking about and had some generally good ideas, but
[03:12:39.186 --> 03:12:40.426]  A few things I didn't like.
[03:12:40.727 --> 03:12:45.310]  They keep talking about the Russians hacking the election.
[03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:50.553]  This is just completely fake.
[03:12:50.813 --> 03:13:02.081]  There's this image that that conjures, especially since a large portion of the population aren't savvy either, like these old jitterbug-using congressmen and senators.
[03:13:02.781 --> 03:13:05.863]  They don't know what hacking is.
[03:13:06.424 --> 03:13:07.705]  They see it in movies.
[03:13:08.385 --> 03:13:12.488]  They read about it in books, in fiction books.
[03:13:14.590 --> 03:13:24.037]  So when they say the election was hacked by the Russians, they picture, uh, Natasha, I am into the American computers.
[03:13:24.357 --> 03:13:28.400]  Now we will destroy... Yeah, here's a prime example.
[03:13:28.641 --> 03:13:31.222]  They use a Fallout 4, a video game,
[03:13:32.008 --> 03:13:33.591]  I don't know.
[03:13:43.274 --> 03:13:51.103]  They want to portray it as a hack, this fictional hacking that we hear about and see in movies and whatnot.
[03:13:51.483 --> 03:14:03.397]  When the truth of the matter is, someone got their hands on the DNC emails that were leaked because one of the dummies used a password.
[03:14:04.238 --> 03:14:04.859]  Password.
[03:14:05.479 --> 03:14:06.500]  That's pretty much it.
[03:14:06.781 --> 03:14:08.102]  Therein lies the problem.
[03:14:08.722 --> 03:14:12.766]  Not that Russia is hacking us, because of course Russia's hacking us.
[03:14:13.327 --> 03:14:14.448]  We're hacking Russia.
[03:14:14.868 --> 03:14:16.310]  China, we're hacking them.
[03:14:16.710 --> 03:14:18.172]  Everyone's hacking everybody.
[03:14:18.552 --> 03:14:20.734]  Yeah, no Clinton aide John Podesta.
[03:14:21.014 --> 03:14:21.635]  Password.
[03:14:22.195 --> 03:14:22.656]  Podesta.
[03:14:22.956 --> 03:14:25.038]  He wanted the... What should I do for password?
[03:14:25.258 --> 03:14:26.199]  How about password?
[03:14:27.660 --> 03:14:43.611]  That was ever since passwords were a thing when people had to put passwords in there was a rule never use the word password that was pretty much the rule but this idiot and and the numerous other idiots that decide
[03:14:44.923 --> 03:14:50.508]  They're just gonna leave this valuable information unsecured.
[03:14:51.029 --> 03:14:53.831]  Hillary Clinton had an unsecured server she was using.
[03:14:54.912 --> 03:14:55.813]  What do you expect?
[03:14:56.053 --> 03:14:59.516]  The Russians or any other foreign country to not hack us?
[03:15:00.217 --> 03:15:00.557]  Stop.
[03:15:00.837 --> 03:15:02.458]  Now you're just being naive and silly.
[03:15:02.958 --> 03:15:03.798]  They're going to.
[03:15:04.118 --> 03:15:05.279]  It's part of the game.
[03:15:05.699 --> 03:15:10.040]  It's part of the espionage that has been happening forever.
[03:15:10.401 --> 03:15:16.843]  The second somebody made a country and another country was made, they started trying to screw each other over.
[03:15:17.483 --> 03:15:18.564]  And spied on each other.
[03:15:18.784 --> 03:15:19.865]  It's never gonna stop.
[03:15:20.446 --> 03:15:24.890]  So when you have this espionage going on, hacking is a big part of it now.
[03:15:25.130 --> 03:15:25.931]  So they will continue.
[03:15:25.951 --> 03:15:30.175]  But the thing is, make sure your stuff is in order.
[03:15:30.956 --> 03:15:32.537]  Make sure your password is in password.
[03:15:32.998 --> 03:15:40.505]  Make sure your Secretary of State doesn't have a server that she's using sending stuff to her daughter about the wedding.
[03:15:41.974 --> 03:15:44.156]  Because that, therein lies the problem.
[03:15:46.017 --> 03:15:53.944]  We've had eight years of Obama doing nothing as far as buttoning up our cyber security.
[03:15:54.464 --> 03:16:03.551]  So now when the election happens and Wikileaks releases these documents, that by the way, none of them were refuted!
[03:16:04.692 --> 03:16:08.014]  The Democrats didn't go, hey, that's a lie!
[03:16:08.654 --> 03:16:17.759]  So the worst thing that happened with this hack was that we all got honest information about the DNC.
[03:16:19.239 --> 03:16:20.060]  Is that bad?
[03:16:20.860 --> 03:16:30.165]  Is that a bad thing that we actually got information that showed them for the shills that they are?
[03:16:31.247 --> 03:16:32.168]  I think that's pretty good.
[03:16:32.788 --> 03:16:38.691]  Again, it wasn't a hack, but they want to present it that way, and it's dishonest.
[03:16:39.492 --> 03:16:52.019]  And then I heard them saying, one of the military gentlemen that was doing the hearing was saying, hey, our intelligence agency is amazing.
[03:16:52.320 --> 03:16:54.601]  Amazing people working for it.
[03:16:55.899 --> 03:16:56.982]  You should trust it.
[03:16:57.623 --> 03:16:59.468]  Here's what the American, and this is what they were saying.
[03:16:59.829 --> 03:17:03.317]  Here's what the American people need to do to help, to help us out.
[03:17:04.278 --> 03:17:08.701]  You gotta take all this hack stuff that you read with a grain of salt.
[03:17:09.161 --> 03:17:09.922]  That's what they said.
[03:17:10.442 --> 03:17:16.346]  Now remember, none of the DNC documents and emails and all that were refuted by anybody.
[03:17:16.766 --> 03:17:17.606]  They were facts.
[03:17:18.207 --> 03:17:19.948]  These were actual emails that were sent.
[03:17:20.468 --> 03:17:24.110]  They're telling us, don't pay attention to those.
[03:17:24.951 --> 03:17:25.972]  Listen to us.
[03:17:26.492 --> 03:17:29.254]  We'll tell you what's legit and what's not.
[03:17:30.154 --> 03:17:31.738]  That is frightening.
[03:17:32.860 --> 03:17:34.524]  And no one's willing to do it anymore.
[03:17:35.045 --> 03:17:39.274]  No one's willing to just take an entity's word for it anymore.
[03:17:40.732 --> 03:17:41.932]  Real life house of cards.
[03:17:42.253 --> 03:17:43.753]  Yeah.
[03:17:43.773 --> 03:17:55.656]  No one is willing to just say, hey, the CIA is saying we should listen to them and to help out our national security as far as this hacking goes.
[03:17:56.196 --> 03:18:00.598]  What we have to do is when you read something, don't read it.
[03:18:01.678 --> 03:18:04.759]  If you want to read something that has been hacked,
[03:18:05.692 --> 03:18:09.136]  And presented to you, don't you look at it!
[03:18:09.857 --> 03:18:11.098]  We'll let you know!
[03:18:13.280 --> 03:18:15.242]  Is anyone falling for that anymore?
[03:18:15.923 --> 03:18:22.510]  Have we seen the blatant lies that have come out of our own government?
[03:18:23.371 --> 03:18:27.775]  The blatant lies and collusion that comes out of the media?
[03:18:28.902 --> 03:18:31.967]  Does anyone have any trust in the media anymore?
[03:18:32.608 --> 03:18:33.449]  It really is.
[03:18:33.770 --> 03:18:40.560]  If Donald Trump does nothing, does nothing else, for four or eight years,
[03:18:41.650 --> 03:18:44.152]  He did one great, amazing thing.
[03:18:44.552 --> 03:18:55.920]  Completely pulled every bit of camouflage off of the media to show them as the liars and shills for their candidate that they are.
[03:18:56.461 --> 03:18:58.662]  And it did irreparable damage.
[03:19:00.144 --> 03:19:05.908]  No one is just taking what the media says at face value anymore and believing it.
[03:19:06.806 --> 03:19:08.247]  We're looking around now.
[03:19:08.507 --> 03:19:11.288]  We're checking alternative sources for our news.
[03:19:12.048 --> 03:19:17.810]  You know, I don't even go to the news sites right away anymore in the morning when I go to check what's been happening.
[03:19:18.171 --> 03:19:27.094]  I go right to social media because I know what the most important story to the mass of people are that day.
[03:19:27.394 --> 03:19:28.355]  It will be right there.
[03:19:29.355 --> 03:19:31.117]  And mainstream media?
[03:19:31.478 --> 03:19:34.621]  They will feed you what they want you to know.
[03:19:35.402 --> 03:19:35.942]  Or not know.
[03:19:36.063 --> 03:19:39.086]  Or they'll feed you the misinformation that they want to give you.
[03:19:39.626 --> 03:19:39.987]  Really?
[03:19:40.527 --> 03:19:42.450]  Are we going to go back to that?
[03:19:43.210 --> 03:19:44.612]  Irreparable damage was done.
[03:19:44.652 --> 03:19:47.655]  And if Trump can be thanked for anything...
[03:19:48.760 --> 03:19:50.082]  It was really exposing them.
[03:19:51.364 --> 03:19:55.970]  Anthony Cumia, InfoWars.com for Alex Jones.
[03:19:56.731 --> 03:19:58.653]  We'll be back in a little while.
[03:19:58.673 --> 03:20:04.000]  I want to talk about these celebrities that think they have influence over anybody.
[03:20:04.281 --> 03:20:04.982]  Be right back!
[03:20:14.361 --> 03:20:23.906]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[03:20:24.926 --> 03:20:33.211]  And so I get questions all the time over the years, why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[03:20:33.971 --> 03:20:34.612]  And it's simple.
[03:20:35.212 --> 03:20:40.317]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[03:20:40.757 --> 03:20:41.758]  And there's a nexus point.
[03:20:41.778 --> 03:20:44.640]  There's quality versus price.
[03:20:44.680 --> 03:20:46.582]  And those two points have to come together.
[03:20:47.202 --> 03:21:00.154]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[03:21:01.542 --> 03:21:03.623]  The true next generation in body armor.
[03:21:04.504 --> 03:21:11.468]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[03:21:12.268 --> 03:21:15.070]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[03:21:15.090 --> 03:21:17.511]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[03:21:17.551 --> 03:21:21.534]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[03:21:21.974 --> 03:21:22.775]  Well, believe me,
[03:21:23.875 --> 03:21:26.556]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[03:21:27.116 --> 03:21:37.558]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[03:21:38.198 --> 03:21:39.818]  It's nanotube technology.
[03:21:40.418 --> 03:21:41.938]  It's created here in Texas.
[03:21:42.578 --> 03:21:49.660]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[03:21:50.400 --> 03:21:50.620]  We've
[03:21:51.700 --> 03:21:52.761]  Went out and did some testing.
[03:21:53.181 --> 03:21:55.522]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[03:21:55.542 --> 03:22:02.006]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[03:22:02.246 --> 03:22:15.534]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[03:22:15.894 --> 03:22:16.715]  Born in Texas.
[03:22:17.075 --> 03:22:17.976]  Made in America.
[03:22:18.236 --> 03:22:20.858]  Exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[03:22:20.958 --> 03:22:21.738]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[03:22:21.798 --> 03:22:22.719]  It's a quarter-inch thick.
[03:22:23.099 --> 03:22:24.420]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[03:22:24.460 --> 03:22:25.101]  It's waterproof.
[03:22:25.121 --> 03:22:25.581]  You can wear it.
[03:22:25.601 --> 03:22:26.182]  It's comfortable.
[03:22:26.262 --> 03:22:27.002]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[03:22:27.022 --> 03:22:29.384]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[03:22:29.864 --> 03:22:37.470]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[03:22:38.170 --> 03:22:41.312]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[03:22:41.752 --> 03:22:48.657]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[03:22:48.677 --> 03:22:49.877]  What did they really say about this?
[03:22:49.917 --> 03:22:51.038]  No, this is through the roof.
[03:22:51.218 --> 03:22:53.960]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[03:22:54.820 --> 03:22:58.601]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[03:22:58.701 --> 03:23:02.783]  Because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[03:23:03.283 --> 03:23:08.284]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[03:23:08.404 --> 03:23:13.166]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns are used in official crimes.
[03:23:13.166 --> 03:23:15.368]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[03:23:15.388 --> 03:23:17.890]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[03:23:17.930 --> 03:23:18.671]  People didn't believe it.
[03:23:18.691 --> 03:23:20.012]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[03:23:20.092 --> 03:23:20.652]  I feed my horse hay.
[03:23:41.787 --> 03:23:43.869]  The Backpack Body Armor is only $200.
[03:23:43.909 --> 03:23:48.974]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[03:23:50.255 --> 03:23:52.157]  Again, fund the InfoWard.
[03:23:52.277 --> 03:23:56.200]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[03:23:56.701 --> 03:23:58.723]  It's a win-win.
[03:23:59.063 --> 03:23:58.723]  $200.
[03:23:59.303 --> 03:24:02.266]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWardStore.com.
[03:24:02.346 --> 03:24:03.047]  It's amazing.
[03:24:09.847 --> 03:24:10.308]  I'm good.
[03:24:23.090 --> 03:24:28.954]  Introducing the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[03:24:29.434 --> 03:24:38.720]  2016 was a historical year in the fight against the globalist takeover with the rise of Donald J. Trump and the fall of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her establishment allies.
[03:24:39.020 --> 03:24:42.962]  But the globalists aren't just going to take this victory sitting down.
[03:24:43.002 --> 03:24:43.382]  No, no, no.
[03:24:43.723 --> 03:24:49.046]  Already Soros and other New World Order allies are plotting to stop Trump and shut down the inauguration.
[03:24:49.366 --> 03:24:52.068]  The info war is heating up like never before.
[03:24:52.748 --> 03:25:03.917]  It's now more important than ever in 2017 for every liberty lover to join the intellectual fight against the globalists and start fighting back against the attack on our bodies.
[03:25:04.357 --> 03:25:09.641]  With all the toxic garbage in the food, water, and air, we're constantly under chemical siege!
[03:25:10.202 --> 03:25:13.965]  Every level making us fat, sick, dumbed down.
[03:25:14.485 --> 03:25:25.190]  Today, we're launching the 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again Super Sale initiative on InfoWarsLife.com to help you take back your temple and fight back against the attack.

[03:26:10.120 --> 03:26:10.580]  Indeed.
[03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:11.781]  Welcome back.
[03:26:12.481 --> 03:26:16.183]  Anthony Cumia in for InfoWars.
[03:26:16.303 --> 03:26:16.884]  On InfoWars.
[03:26:16.904 --> 03:26:17.484]  This is great.
[03:26:18.765 --> 03:26:19.185]  I love it.
[03:26:19.565 --> 03:26:20.025]  Love it!
[03:26:20.886 --> 03:26:23.948]  I've had a lot of people tell me, I heard you on InfoWars.
[03:26:24.488 --> 03:26:25.008]  I like that.
[03:26:25.409 --> 03:26:26.109]  I appreciate it.
[03:26:26.269 --> 03:26:26.589]  Thank you.
[03:26:28.539 --> 03:26:33.583]  My God, when will celebrities shut up?
[03:26:34.504 --> 03:26:35.845]  They really have to learn.
[03:26:36.205 --> 03:26:37.766]  Here's where we want to see you.
[03:26:38.066 --> 03:26:38.967]  Are you a singer?
[03:26:39.608 --> 03:26:40.668]  We want to see you sing.
[03:26:40.688 --> 03:26:42.090]  I can hear you sing.
[03:26:42.430 --> 03:26:43.290]  Are you an actor?
[03:26:43.851 --> 03:26:45.192]  We want to see you in a movie.
[03:26:46.533 --> 03:26:49.315]  Aside from that, shut up!
[03:26:50.536 --> 03:26:51.857]  No one cares.
[03:26:52.498 --> 03:26:57.662]  They can't get it through their head that they're irrelevant.
[03:26:58.499 --> 03:27:07.886]  When it comes to our ideas, what we want for our country, they think they can sway people.
[03:27:08.447 --> 03:27:14.171]  They think they have an influence because they sing songs or act.
[03:27:15.212 --> 03:27:25.438]  Or are on a stage that they have influence over our belief system and how we want our country to run.
[03:27:25.998 --> 03:27:34.222]  And the pomposity when you watch them in the numerous horrid videos they make with the same format.
[03:27:34.603 --> 03:27:38.205]  It's a bunch of has-beens, wannabes, celebrities.
[03:27:39.286 --> 03:27:40.046]  And here's what they do.
[03:27:40.387 --> 03:27:46.830]  They put one background behind him and then they go, uh, and we need your help, your help, your help.
[03:27:47.651 --> 03:27:49.211]  It's the same format.
[03:27:49.572 --> 03:27:50.952]  At least come up with something different.
[03:27:51.833 --> 03:27:58.316]  And then they tell you what you should do to be exactly like them.
[03:27:59.657 --> 03:27:59.977]  Really?
[03:28:00.297 --> 03:28:04.420]  Rich and behind a gated house with security guards?
[03:28:06.263 --> 03:28:10.144]  And they're gonna tell you how you should live your life and what you should do and how the country should run?
[03:28:12.864 --> 03:28:19.026]  Sarah Silverman is one of these celebrities.
[03:28:19.466 --> 03:28:23.206]  She's a mediocre stand-up comic.
[03:28:25.247 --> 03:28:27.227]  Did some acting in some movies.
[03:28:27.407 --> 03:28:30.668]  Not anything big or good, but she knows
[03:28:31.607 --> 03:28:32.888]  What we should all be doing.
[03:28:32.908 --> 03:28:33.609]  And not just us.
[03:28:34.010 --> 03:28:36.512]  She knows what the electors should have done.
[03:28:37.782 --> 03:28:43.044]  And what now Congress should do, blocking Donald Trump.
[03:28:44.385 --> 03:28:47.366]  And she knows what's offensive and what's not.
[03:28:47.706 --> 03:28:48.667]  That's very important.
[03:28:48.707 --> 03:28:51.188]  We should use her as the litmus test.
[03:28:52.008 --> 03:29:03.854]  A woman who, by the way, was in Blackface during one of our comedy bits a few years back, was in Blackface and she said it was okay because she's one of the good guys.
[03:29:04.674 --> 03:29:12.058]  She understood that she, and people should understand, that she was doing it in the context of comedy and being ironic.
[03:29:12.758 --> 03:29:17.581]  Because the left will always have what is called the convenience of context.
[03:29:18.254 --> 03:29:22.197]  Anyone else does anything that they don't like, that they deem offensive?
[03:29:22.558 --> 03:29:28.623]  It doesn't matter how you explain it, what context it was in, you are an evil person!
[03:29:29.163 --> 03:29:35.008]  Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, and a bunch of other ones.
[03:29:35.228 --> 03:29:42.834]  But that's what you are, because you are not as brilliant as these celebrities are, are you?
[03:29:43.715 --> 03:29:44.736]  No, you can't be!
[03:29:44.756 --> 03:29:46.097]  You don't know, they know!
[03:29:46.818 --> 03:29:51.421]  And, uh, it's wonderful that we have them telling us what we should or shouldn't do.
[03:29:51.922 --> 03:29:55.885]  We'll, uh, be back in, uh, a very short, uh, break.
[03:29:56.365 --> 03:29:58.867]  And, uh, more InfoWars.
[03:29:58.987 --> 03:29:59.908]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.409 --> 03:30:02.010]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.931 --> 03:30:05.613]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.071 --> 03:30:16.492]  The brutal torture of a special needs man was live streamed on Facebook as he was bound and gagged in Chicago.
[03:30:16.512 --> 03:30:22.614]  Now in the video, several people in the apartment that took him could be seen laughing and eating during Tuesday night's attack.
[03:30:22.774 --> 03:30:25.334]  The victim was viciously beaten and had been kidnapped.
[03:30:25.434 --> 03:30:32.276]  Now at least four of the alleged captors were taken into custody on Wednesday after their footage began making the rounds on social media.
[03:30:32.376 --> 03:30:39.217]  Now the footage showed the attackers cutting the victim's hair until his scalp bled, slashing his clothes and reportedly slapping him as they ashed
[03:30:39.477 --> 03:30:39.917]  I don't know.
[03:31:10.317 --> 03:31:12.018]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:31:12.599 --> 03:31:13.939]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[03:31:44.577 --> 03:31:49.020]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[03:31:49.301 --> 03:31:58.108]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:31:58.308 --> 03:32:01.609]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[03:32:09.791 --> 03:32:15.952]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:32:16.513 --> 03:32:17.913]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:32:18.820 --> 03:32:20.680]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:32:21.301 --> 03:32:26.862]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[03:32:27.442 --> 03:32:35.444]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[03:32:35.864 --> 03:32:37.905]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[03:32:38.205 --> 03:32:39.405]  This is the best system out there.
[03:32:39.665 --> 03:32:42.426]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[03:32:42.686 --> 03:32:43.406]  This is how it works.
[03:32:43.706 --> 03:32:44.227]  You order.
[03:32:44.367 --> 03:32:45.147]  Customized or
[03:32:46.247 --> 03:32:47.709]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[03:32:48.189 --> 03:32:51.352]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[03:32:51.652 --> 03:32:55.696]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[03:32:55.916 --> 03:32:56.697]  You cannot lose.
[03:32:56.737 --> 03:32:57.838]  You're funding the Infowar.
[03:32:58.138 --> 03:33:04.884]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[03:33:05.204 --> 03:33:09.168]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[03:33:21.883 --> 03:33:26.907]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:33:27.408 --> 03:33:30.090]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:42.068 --> 03:33:47.712]  Man, the media just keeps getting worse and worse.
[03:33:49.213 --> 03:33:52.296]  They've already been exposed for being the liars that they are.
[03:33:53.537 --> 03:33:54.778]  And they're not stopping.
[03:33:55.378 --> 03:33:58.801]  There's a horrific story out of Chicago.
[03:33:58.841 --> 03:34:01.523]  I'm sure everyone knows about this by now.
[03:34:02.671 --> 03:34:03.531]  We broke yesterday.
[03:34:05.012 --> 03:34:10.034]  A man was kidnapped and tortured for about two days.
[03:34:10.054 --> 03:34:11.734]  48 hours, I think.
[03:34:12.214 --> 03:34:12.835]  That's two days.
[03:34:15.115 --> 03:34:16.776]  The perpetrators were black.
[03:34:17.296 --> 03:34:21.438]  The victim, a white, mentally challenged gentleman.
[03:34:22.378 --> 03:34:29.160]  And he was held against his will, held captive, forced to do degrading things.
[03:34:29.300 --> 03:34:30.241]  He was assaulted.
[03:34:31.601 --> 03:34:38.706]  Threatened, and obviously from the video, in grave fear for his life.
[03:34:40.768 --> 03:34:44.470]  There's no denying how horrible this is.
[03:34:44.490 --> 03:34:47.032]  What makes it worse
[03:34:50.456 --> 03:34:53.839]  Is the lack of honest media coverage.
[03:34:54.399 --> 03:34:57.902]  Oh, are these the four perpetrators?
[03:34:58.083 --> 03:35:02.726]  They actually arrested them and have charged them with a hate crime.
[03:35:02.746 --> 03:35:04.848]  This is pretty new news right here.
[03:35:05.189 --> 03:35:09.472]  I guess they're having a press conference with the law enforcement in Chicago right now about this.
[03:35:09.732 --> 03:35:12.295]  But they have charged them with a hate crime.
[03:35:13.295 --> 03:35:16.858]  Now, this is something that should make everybody
[03:35:17.739 --> 03:35:22.122]  I think we're living in an insane asylum for a country.
[03:35:22.522 --> 03:35:23.782]  Not that this was done.
[03:35:24.443 --> 03:35:32.187]  We all know that sick individuals are out there that do twisted, sick stuff like this.
[03:35:33.228 --> 03:35:33.988]  That isn't why.
[03:35:34.949 --> 03:35:46.616]  What makes me believe we live in a mental institution is that there were people arguing that this was not a hate crime.
[03:35:47.722 --> 03:35:53.025]  Under the guidelines of racial hate crimes in this country.
[03:35:54.526 --> 03:36:00.229]  I, for one, do not believe in hate crime legislation.
[03:36:00.609 --> 03:36:02.430]  I don't think there should be hate crime.
[03:36:02.690 --> 03:36:08.253]  I think whatever the crime was, that's what you should be tried for, and that's what
[03:36:10.521 --> 03:36:13.606]  The consequence should fit the crime.
[03:36:14.487 --> 03:36:26.564]  This is a terrible kidnapping, an assault on a human being, and regardless of what their motivation was, I don't think that even matters.
[03:36:28.635 --> 03:36:49.746]  But, since there is hate crime legislation, which a huge portion of the time is only used for white-on-minority crimes, it is refreshing to see that if we are going to have hate crime legislation, that it was used this time.
[03:36:51.175 --> 03:37:07.346]  But there was an argument all over Twitter, arguments on news channels, talking heads were coming up and debating whether this qualified as a hate crime.
[03:37:08.647 --> 03:37:09.828]  Are you kidding me?
[03:37:11.909 --> 03:37:19.054]  If there is a single definition of a hate crime, if you needed
[03:37:20.670 --> 03:37:26.252]  One instance to show what a hate crime is.
[03:37:27.572 --> 03:37:28.452]  This would be it.
[03:37:29.473 --> 03:37:31.133]  This instance would be it.
[03:37:31.153 --> 03:37:47.518]  To have people actually saying, well, the criteria, ah, were they hurting him and assaulting him and keeping him against his will based on race?
[03:37:48.806 --> 03:37:51.447]  Well, let's look at the tape.
[03:37:52.047 --> 03:37:56.409]  Huh, is that where they're cutting off a chunk of his scalp?
[03:37:58.090 --> 03:38:01.071]  Oh, and they're saying, um, uh, F white people?
[03:38:02.512 --> 03:38:03.292]  F Donald Trump?
[03:38:03.873 --> 03:38:04.833]  Uh, yeah, yeah.
[03:38:05.513 --> 03:38:07.134]  Forcing him to say I love black people?
[03:38:07.974 --> 03:38:09.595]  Oh, now they're putting his face in the toilet.
[03:38:10.656 --> 03:38:13.317]  Alright, now they're cutting his clothes off.
[03:38:14.898 --> 03:38:19.823]  Oh, they're hitting him, and more racial epithets.
[03:38:21.504 --> 03:38:26.129]  It was the epitome of a hate crime.
[03:38:27.090 --> 03:38:37.581]  And there were people on CNN, I was watching some of the, Don Lemon, old Don Lemon over there at CNN, he had a panel of four people
[03:38:38.772 --> 03:38:56.838]  And there was a Democratic strategist, there she is, Democratic strategist, Simone Sanders, and she was actually arguing that this wasn't a hate crime, and saying that Trump
[03:38:59.156 --> 03:39:11.343]  And his racist campaign and whatnot got these individuals in the mindset to commit such a heinous act.
[03:39:12.083 --> 03:39:22.169]  Again, blaming Trump for four people torturing somebody.
[03:39:23.325 --> 03:39:26.988]  With no regard for that person's humanity, none whatsoever.
[03:39:27.528 --> 03:39:35.494]  It is such a hard video to watch, and I've watched some just twisted stuff online.
[03:39:36.795 --> 03:39:48.243]  But this is, there's a fear in this poor guy's eyes when they are threatening to stab him and laughing about it, that it goes right through you.
[03:39:49.450 --> 03:39:59.717]  And here's what's really angering about, of course you're angry at that, but what's angering about it on a bigger level is the media will not acknowledge that this is an issue.
[03:40:00.197 --> 03:40:07.842]  They will not pull race into it when it is an absolutely racial incident.
[03:40:08.802 --> 03:40:14.246]  These four did this to this gentleman because he was a white man.
[03:40:15.191 --> 03:40:21.514]  And they wanted to hurt a white person because Donald Trump.
[03:40:21.974 --> 03:40:23.015]  Because Trump.
[03:40:24.115 --> 03:40:39.242]  And I think the media is culpable in it, again, like they were in many of these riots that we saw in certain cities, based on a false narrative of police brutality.
[03:40:40.994 --> 03:40:49.957]  Killings of innocent people when we find out later on that there were guns involved and violence and attacking of the police officers and whatnot.
[03:40:51.297 --> 03:41:00.400]  But that doesn't get reported with the fervor that the initial assault gets reported.
[03:41:00.480 --> 03:41:07.282]  So people leave with the idea that, wow, the police are brutalizing the African-American community.
[03:41:08.885 --> 03:41:16.749]  And when you have the media helping that narrative, they cause things like this to happen.
[03:41:17.709 --> 03:41:19.270]  I'm not blaming the media.
[03:41:19.810 --> 03:41:21.431]  I'm saying they are part of this.
[03:41:21.551 --> 03:41:23.112]  They are part of this big picture.
[03:41:23.552 --> 03:41:25.633]  Yes, Dallas, Texas.
[03:41:26.213 --> 03:41:29.275]  Five Dallas officers that were killed as payback.
[03:41:30.275 --> 03:41:32.136]  That's what the police chief was saying.
[03:41:32.476 --> 03:41:33.777]  And that is payback
[03:41:34.824 --> 03:41:40.667]  Of what the media, that narrative that Black Lives Matter and the media perpetuate.
[03:41:41.787 --> 03:41:42.888]  A false narrative.
[03:41:43.448 --> 03:41:44.669]  Hands up, don't shoot.
[03:41:44.889 --> 03:41:45.629]  Never happened.
[03:41:47.390 --> 03:41:49.691]  The gentle giant, as you might remember.
[03:41:50.332 --> 03:41:51.252]  Not so gentle.
[03:41:52.313 --> 03:41:56.735]  These things get into people's minds, then they don't hear the actual facts.
[03:41:57.628 --> 03:42:07.091]  And then when a grand jury doesn't indict the police officer or the person that was defending themselves, then people go, well, what happened?
[03:42:07.451 --> 03:42:09.632]  The justice system failed us again.
[03:42:09.652 --> 03:42:12.473]  It's like, no, because you didn't have the proper information.
[03:42:13.093 --> 03:42:17.194]  You had this false narrative that the media was putting out there.
[03:42:17.634 --> 03:42:18.515]  And if anyone
[03:42:19.485 --> 03:42:37.433]  doesn't believe that people have died based on these false narratives, that police officers' lives are in more jeopardy than ever because of these false narratives that are perpetuated by the media, you're sadly mistaken for a blithering idiot.
[03:42:38.333 --> 03:42:38.794]  That's it.
[03:42:39.114 --> 03:42:41.015]  That's the only two choices I'm giving you.
[03:42:42.115 --> 03:42:44.036]  Sadly mistaken, blithering idiot.
[03:42:46.437 --> 03:42:48.218]  To even have to question
[03:42:49.554 --> 03:42:54.417]  Whether this was a racially motivated assault is ridiculous.
[03:42:55.258 --> 03:42:57.059]  And again, everyone says this.
[03:42:57.219 --> 03:43:01.602]  I've read this on so many Twitters, and it's absolutely true.
[03:43:03.123 --> 03:43:17.873]  If this situation had been reversed, and a young African-American male with a mental disability was tortured by four white people
[03:43:18.988 --> 03:43:27.234]  Who were yelling racial epithets at him and taunting him with Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or whatever.
[03:43:28.095 --> 03:43:31.357]  You would see fireworks!
[03:43:32.018 --> 03:43:32.778]  Oh my God!
[03:43:32.978 --> 03:43:37.322]  First of all, it'd just be cities in flames.
[03:43:37.882 --> 03:43:40.364]  You'd see cities on flame with rock and roll.
[03:43:40.964 --> 03:43:48.130]  There would just be a pandemonium and the news would be covering it non-stop!
[03:43:49.139 --> 03:43:50.019]  Non-stop!
[03:43:51.500 --> 03:44:00.403]  But we get a little of this Fox News I saw, I guess they were covering it for the most part, but the other news agencies not really touching it.
[03:44:00.923 --> 03:44:01.383]  There it is.
[03:44:01.724 --> 03:44:04.244]  Look at the face on this poor guy!
[03:44:05.005 --> 03:44:06.445]  That is fear!
[03:44:07.946 --> 03:44:13.668]  Based on nothing but his race and the fact that Donald Trump was elected president.
[03:44:15.305 --> 03:44:20.428]  I am very surprised that they charged these four with a hate crime.
[03:44:20.868 --> 03:44:21.608]  Very surprised.
[03:44:22.068 --> 03:44:27.631]  Maybe this is that first step that we're seeing of a Trump presidency.
[03:44:28.752 --> 03:44:34.835]  And what might happen, that law enforcement will be able to do their job.
[03:44:35.495 --> 03:44:41.078]  We'll be able to take back some of these cities that are in turmoil, especially Chicago.
[03:44:41.558 --> 03:44:44.560]  Some parts of Chicago are off-limits.
[03:44:45.472 --> 03:44:46.233]  Just off limits.
[03:44:46.933 --> 03:44:48.755]  You couldn't go in there, you wouldn't want to.
[03:44:49.315 --> 03:44:55.000]  People are being killed in record numbers, and the police are not being allowed to do their job.
[03:44:56.381 --> 03:44:59.504]  And for what they are being allowed to do, they don't want to do it.
[03:44:59.564 --> 03:45:01.625]  Why do they want to jeopardize not only their lives?
[03:45:01.866 --> 03:45:02.806]  And that's the amazing thing.
[03:45:03.026 --> 03:45:06.329]  Police officers are willing to jeopardize their lives.
[03:45:06.730 --> 03:45:08.531]  They know that's part of the job.
[03:45:09.212 --> 03:45:10.333]  They signed up for it.
[03:45:11.291 --> 03:45:16.734]  But when you have to think, wow, am I going to go to prison for doing my job?
[03:45:17.574 --> 03:45:28.319]  Oh boy, am I going to be fired and shunned and have to try to figure out a new career with my family and stuff because I was doing my job?
[03:45:28.999 --> 03:45:30.760]  That's, that's ridiculous.
[03:45:31.521 --> 03:45:34.722]  And that's what we got under eight years of Obama.
[03:45:35.182 --> 03:45:38.124]  But Obama doesn't run the states and the poli-
[03:45:39.895 --> 03:45:44.060]  Every president puts a mood over the country.
[03:45:45.902 --> 03:45:46.403]  It happens.
[03:45:46.543 --> 03:45:47.524]  We've seen this happen.
[03:45:48.004 --> 03:45:51.349]  When we went from Carter to Ronald Reagan,
[03:45:52.401 --> 03:45:53.942]  The mood of the country changed.
[03:45:54.502 --> 03:45:55.702]  There was a pride again.
[03:45:55.722 --> 03:46:00.344]  There wasn't this feeling that we were a paper tiger, that the U.S.
[03:46:00.424 --> 03:46:02.905]  was disrespected around the world.
[03:46:03.285 --> 03:46:08.647]  Reagan came in, and it was not through just legislation.
[03:46:08.667 --> 03:46:10.748]  It was a mood.
[03:46:11.308 --> 03:46:16.870]  He captured the hearts of the American people and what the American people wanted.
[03:46:18.436 --> 03:46:22.400]  Obama put this mood over the country of division.
[03:46:23.221 --> 03:46:25.504]  I think the country more divided than ever.
[03:46:25.964 --> 03:46:35.074]  And that was something placed by his actions, his comments during some of these racial incidents.
[03:46:36.595 --> 03:46:40.659]  He would come out immediately before any facts were out and condemn people.
[03:46:41.650 --> 03:46:47.055]  The Trayvon Martin case, when he said, uh, if I had a son, he would have looked like Trayvon.
[03:46:47.676 --> 03:46:54.843]  Well, if you had two sons and two daughters, uh, they might look like the people that tortured that poor gentleman, uh, in Chicago.
[03:46:56.408 --> 03:47:03.272]  But, uh, they just go out without, he just went out there without any knowledge and pretty much picked a side.
[03:47:04.292 --> 03:47:07.174]  And people got disgusted over it, over the course of eight years.
[03:47:07.714 --> 03:47:11.356]  And now, we're starting to get this feeling, maybe, maybe,
[03:47:12.136 --> 03:47:16.339]  There's going to be real justice and law enforcement back in this country again.
[03:47:16.720 --> 03:47:23.045]  And seeing that in Chicago they charged these four with a hate crime is a good sign.
[03:47:23.065 --> 03:47:29.130]  Because I gotta be honest with you, I've been beaten down with all this stuff.
[03:47:29.490 --> 03:47:33.173]  I thought for sure they were not going to charge them with a hate crime.
[03:47:33.753 --> 03:47:38.577]  Based on their news conference from last night where we heard the police chief say,
[03:47:40.967 --> 03:47:42.108]  They do stupid things.
[03:47:42.689 --> 03:47:43.950]  I was like, uh-oh!
[03:47:44.850 --> 03:47:47.193]  We heard the kids do stupid things line!
[03:47:47.853 --> 03:47:58.162]  That means a slap on the wrist or something, but... I think they realized the hell that they'd have to pay if they actually didn't pursue this as a hate crime.
[03:47:58.663 --> 03:48:06.930]  And then the, uh... With the looming presence of Sessions as the Attorney General,
[03:48:10.051 --> 03:48:11.172]  Trump president now.
[03:48:11.653 --> 03:48:14.596]  Maybe things will change.
[03:48:15.017 --> 03:48:15.698]  I hope so.
[03:48:15.718 --> 03:48:26.150]  I hope because the only way to deter things like this from happening is through strict law enforcement and punishment.
[03:48:26.751 --> 03:48:30.074]  There has to be consequences for these actions.
[03:48:31.427 --> 03:48:45.212]  And there doesn't seem to be many consequences for a lot of these things that are pushed off as just, well, it's kids, well, it's poverty, well, it's this, it's drugs, it's gangs, it's the... Fix it!
[03:48:45.972 --> 03:48:47.212]  Just fix it!
[03:48:47.773 --> 03:48:48.593]  You're in charge!
[03:48:50.077 --> 03:49:03.528]  You're in charge over there, Rahm, Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, doing nothing, nothing to protect his citizens against the carnage that is going on in Chicago.
[03:49:03.568 --> 03:49:06.510]  So it's a good sign, a good first sign.
[03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:13.135]  And there's been, like I said earlier, a lot of these even leading up to the inauguration of Donald Trump.
[03:49:13.436 --> 03:49:17.039]  I think the climate of the country, the feeling
[03:49:18.019 --> 03:49:19.701]  of the people are changing.
[03:49:20.161 --> 03:49:28.429]  I think we're getting a good little preview of bringing this stuff back into some type of order.
[03:49:29.029 --> 03:49:29.510]  Please.
[03:49:30.631 --> 03:49:40.620]  Because it's really frustrating to sit and watch and see nothing happen when horrible crimes are committed.
[03:49:43.737 --> 03:49:45.017]  No one seems to really care.
[03:49:45.797 --> 03:49:50.958]  No one seems to want to enforce the law.
[03:49:51.779 --> 03:49:54.459]  We've seen it in the protests that have happened.
[03:49:54.939 --> 03:49:58.360]  A lot of the police forces are told to just, hey, back off.
[03:49:58.900 --> 03:50:01.981]  And there's huge amounts of property damage and injuries.
[03:50:04.001 --> 03:50:06.062]  And nothing comes of it.
[03:50:07.142 --> 03:50:07.462]  Why?
[03:50:07.602 --> 03:50:08.142]  Why is that?
[03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:19.981]  Because people are scared, and the police are scared to enforce the law because they fear for their jobs, their lives, their freedom.
[03:50:20.862 --> 03:50:31.393]  I mean, can you imagine putting on that uniform every day, knowing that you might lose your life, accepting that, and then realizing that you could lose your freedom?
[03:50:32.298 --> 03:50:33.219]  For doing your job?
[03:50:33.779 --> 03:50:41.424]  Because somebody has a differing opinion than you about how a situation to be handled?
[03:50:42.504 --> 03:50:43.165]  It's ridiculous.
[03:50:43.785 --> 03:50:46.967]  I say we give them a little more latitude, if you know what I mean.
[03:50:50.329 --> 03:50:55.392]  Anthony Cumia in for Alex Jones, Infowars.com.
[03:50:57.944 --> 03:50:59.147]  Couldn't be happier to be here.
[03:50:59.829 --> 03:51:00.150]  Love it.
[03:51:00.431 --> 03:51:02.998]  And we'll be back in no time.
[03:51:03.539 --> 03:51:04.381]  A couple of days.
[03:51:04.481 --> 03:51:05.584]  I'm going.
[03:51:10.123 --> 03:51:11.344]  Wars are not cheap.
[03:51:11.364 --> 03:51:16.006]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[03:51:16.646 --> 03:51:19.407]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[03:51:20.007 --> 03:51:21.008]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[03:51:21.148 --> 03:51:22.508]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[03:51:23.129 --> 03:51:29.912]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[03:51:30.272 --> 03:51:34.594]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[03:51:35.214 --> 03:51:44.340]  That's why on major third party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[03:51:45.261 --> 03:51:56.929]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic of the world.
[03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:59.031]  We apply to the products we bring in.
[03:51:59.918 --> 03:52:06.305]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[03:52:06.906 --> 03:52:11.250]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[03:52:11.270 --> 03:52:12.552]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[03:52:13.012 --> 03:52:15.054]  More coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[03:52:15.615 --> 03:52:16.076]  We're good to go.
[03:52:33.618 --> 03:52:34.879]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[03:52:35.319 --> 03:52:36.299]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[03:52:36.319 --> 03:52:37.940]  I dedicated myself to working out.
[03:52:37.960 --> 03:52:38.580]  I was in great shape.
[03:52:38.600 --> 03:52:39.681]  I'm dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[03:52:39.701 --> 03:52:40.521]  Gained a lot of weight.
[03:52:40.541 --> 03:52:44.803]  But I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[03:52:44.983 --> 03:52:46.624]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[03:52:46.924 --> 03:52:49.205]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[03:52:49.386 --> 03:52:54.168]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[03:52:54.748 --> 03:53:04.840]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, BioPQQ, you name it.
[03:53:04.860 --> 03:53:05.361]  170-plus studies.
[03:53:05.401 --> 03:53:06.382]  We can make claims on this.
[03:53:06.402 --> 03:53:12.469]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[03:53:13.250 --> 03:53:15.053]  I've got this at my fingertips at cost.
[03:53:15.133 --> 03:53:15.914]  I forget to take it.
[03:53:15.934 --> 03:53:16.855]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[03:53:16.895 --> 03:53:18.757]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[03:53:18.837 --> 03:53:21.020]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[03:53:21.481 --> 03:53:22.042]  Well, guess what?
[03:53:22.082 --> 03:53:23.323]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[03:53:23.704 --> 03:53:24.284]  It's discounted.
[03:53:24.565 --> 03:53:27.589]  Now, in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[03:53:27.609 --> 03:53:29.030]  A lot of the products we have left
[03:53:29.571 --> 03:53:34.313]  We still have some supplies up and we'll sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[03:53:34.713 --> 03:53:39.434]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[03:53:39.795 --> 03:53:41.815]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[03:53:42.316 --> 03:53:44.136]  Secret 12, 20% off.
[03:53:44.296 --> 03:53:45.457]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[03:53:45.697 --> 03:53:47.317]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[03:53:47.637 --> 03:53:50.678]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid, I love taking it every day, 20% off.
[03:53:50.939 --> 03:53:52.159]  Prostagard, 20% off.
[03:53:52.499 --> 03:53:54.380]  And many others at Infowarslife.com.
[03:53:55.260 --> 03:54:07.243]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists, so I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[03:54:07.463 --> 03:54:08.583]  Make our bodies great again.
[03:54:09.984 --> 03:54:12.184]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:54:12.764 --> 03:54:15.525]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:22.665 --> 03:54:32.830]  Tactical nanotechnology body armor, previously only available to military and law enforcement, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:33.290 --> 03:54:44.136]  Over the past year, InfoWars has been working on some of the top special operators in the United States to source you the absolute highest quality and affordable body armor out there.
[03:54:44.756 --> 03:54:54.122]  Our team of former Blackwater operators and Army Rangers analyzed and tested hundreds of different body armor technologies for their stopping power and safety.
[03:54:54.443 --> 03:55:05.050]  Now, InfoWars is excited to announce that we have partnered up with National Defense Laboratories to bring you an advanced nanotechnology body armor that until now was only available
[03:55:05.290 --> 03:55:05.871]  To the U.S.
[03:55:05.931 --> 03:55:07.292]  military and law enforcement.
[03:55:07.612 --> 03:55:16.380]  This cutting-edge body armor uses a patented form of carbon nanotube technology that makes it the lightest, strongest, and most flexible body armor on the market.
[03:55:16.941 --> 03:55:26.770]  Even though it's only a quarter-inch thick, this body armor is field-tested and confirmed to stop up to 50-cal 50-AE pistol cartridge.
[03:55:27.921 --> 03:55:31.604]  No, one of the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[03:55:31.664 --> 03:55:32.164]  Yes, it is.
[03:55:32.804 --> 03:55:39.969]  This is really a game-changing body armor that's waterproof, super lightweight, made in the USA, and comes with a 20-year warranty.
[03:55:40.370 --> 03:55:48.415]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com and see the exclusive line of tactical nanotechnology body armor previously only available to the U.S.
[03:55:48.475 --> 03:55:49.936]  military and law enforcement.
[03:55:51.497 --> 03:55:51.858]  Man!
[03:55:52.961 --> 03:55:57.624]  That sounds pretty cool, if you ask me.
[03:55:58.024 --> 03:56:02.467]  We were talking before about celebrities and how just out of touch they are.
[03:56:02.987 --> 03:56:09.351]  They are not telling us anything.
[03:56:09.912 --> 03:56:15.715]  They're completely delusional if they think they have any say over what we want.
[03:56:17.336 --> 03:56:21.219]  Milo, of course, putting out his book, and Simon & Schuster putting out.
[03:56:21.499 --> 03:56:24.441]  Sarah Silverman and Judd Apatow, I saw a couple of their tweets.
[03:56:24.701 --> 03:56:27.744]  They were talking about how can Simon & Schuster do this?
[03:56:28.404 --> 03:56:33.067]  They're trying to figure out a way to not get his book published.
[03:56:33.888 --> 03:56:35.969]  Thank God Simon & Schuster not falling for it.
[03:56:36.290 --> 03:56:44.636]  But when you talk about fascism, the idea of preventing people from reading books,
[03:56:45.843 --> 03:56:54.649]  And writing books and keeping books from the American people is unbelievably fascist.
[03:56:55.069 --> 03:56:58.311]  That is one of the great definitions of fascism.
[03:57:00.333 --> 03:57:07.698]  I suggested that maybe Sarah and Judd wait till the book comes out, buy a bunch of them, and then just burn them in the middle of the road.
[03:57:07.738 --> 03:57:08.318]  How about that?
[03:57:08.338 --> 03:57:10.720]  How about you just burn the books?
[03:57:12.021 --> 03:57:14.963]  Yeah, they want to stop the publication.
[03:57:16.567 --> 03:57:31.795]  The idea that they, Sarasota and Judd Apatow, believe they know what you should and shouldn't be reading is the pomposity of that!
[03:57:32.816 --> 03:57:42.441]  The idea that these two idiots actually believe they know what's best for you to read or not read.
[03:57:42.941 --> 03:57:43.642]  The freedom
[03:57:45.011 --> 03:57:54.538]  To absorb whatever information you want is one of the greatest freedoms we have here in this country.
[03:57:55.479 --> 03:57:57.780]  Regardless, you don't want to read it, you don't have to.
[03:57:57.940 --> 03:58:04.085]  No one is going to pin down Sarah Silverman and push the book in her face and hold her eyes open and make her read it.
[03:58:06.627 --> 03:58:12.191]  But they actually believe that this book shouldn't even be published.
[03:58:13.379 --> 03:58:15.542]  Based on their ideology and opinions.
[03:58:16.303 --> 03:58:22.430]  So, again, if celebrities can do us one favor in 2017... Shut up!
[03:58:26.423 --> 03:58:29.886]  It's the greatest thing you could do, is shut up.
[03:58:29.946 --> 03:58:36.931]  They ought to give awards at all the award shows, the Oscars and whatnot, for people that have shut up over the year the most.
[03:58:37.431 --> 03:58:42.535]  The celebrity that has shut their mouth the most, and then they come out and accept the award.
[03:58:43.015 --> 03:58:44.616]  Thanks for watching and listening.
[03:58:45.317 --> 03:58:47.719]  Anthony Cumia for InfoWars.com.
[03:58:52.162 --> 03:58:56.105]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:59:00.137 --> 03:59:09.142]  We have an article that's up on our website, written by Clifford Cunningham, and it talks about how the Communist Chinese government is moving against Trump, asserting control over strategic ports.
[03:59:09.342 --> 03:59:19.427]  Now, the state-controlled corporations are masquerading as private entities, and they're accelerating their plan to acquire control over deep water ports and major shipping lanes across the world.
[03:59:19.527 --> 03:59:26.371]  The Sri Lankan government, heavily indebted to China, recently agreed to lease approximately 80% of a strategic port in the southern part
