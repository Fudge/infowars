[00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:21.007]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:25.009]  Today is Wednesday, June 14th, 2017.
[00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.670]  I'm Millie Weaver and here's what's coming up on the news tonight.
[00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.220]  Confirmed!
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.424]  The gunman was an anti-Trump leftist, 66-year-old James Hodgkinson.
[00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:55.575]  The gunman who targeted Republican lawmakers during an attempted massacre this morning is now known to be a huge Bernie Sanders supporter who called President Donald Trump a traitor and wanted to destroy him.
[00:00:56.155 --> 00:01:07.230]  Meanwhile, Senator Rand Paul says the quick response of the officers on the scene prevented a serious incident from turning into an all-out massacre.
[00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:12.257]  And look who's celebrating the shooting of Representative Scalise.
[00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:15.582]  That's right, the tolerant progressive left.
[00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:21.673]  And they hit social media today to reveal their true violent nature.
[00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:26.000]  All that plus much more, up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:33.946]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.307]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:44.871]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:48.454]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:59.083]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:06.510]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.651]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:16.637]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:23.101]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.847]  Yes.
[00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:13.388]  I'm Millie Weaver and I'll be taking you guys through the news tonight.
[00:03:13.788 --> 00:03:27.461]  Well, the big news today was when a 66-year-old liberal lunatic went to the GOP's baseball practice in Virginia and decided to go on a shooting rampage.
[00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:28.081]  That's right.
[00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:31.825]  He had the intention to massively assassinate
[00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:33.006]  I don't know.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.142]  Rand Paul, Senator Rand Paul was even there.
[00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:53.846]  I mean, we had numerous senators, congressmen, representatives all there.
[00:03:53.886 --> 00:03:54.867]  They witnessed this.
[00:03:55.288 --> 00:03:57.449]  They were definitely scared.
[00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.432]  You could tell it in the way they were talking about it.
[00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:05.256]  But what's interesting here is this man, James T. Hodgkinson.
[00:04:05.556 --> 00:04:11.241]  Now, of course, as soon as everybody finds out who this shooter is, they immediately start to look into this person.
[00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:16.662]  And it turns out that this guy was a Bernie Sanders supporting leftist.
[00:04:17.102 --> 00:04:26.764]  Now Bernie Sanders did come out and address that when that went around in the media and he did actually speak out against this type of violence.
[00:04:26.804 --> 00:04:31.765]  It's not okay to go on a shooting rampage because you ideologically disagree with someone.
[00:04:31.785 --> 00:04:32.865]  I mean, my gosh!
[00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:38.526]  Turns out that this shooter was also a huge fan of Rachel Maddow.
[00:04:38.606 --> 00:04:39.746]  Wow, what a surprise.
[00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:45.110]  He was also a viewer of the John Oliver Show and the Daily Show.
[00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:49.694]  So he was a partaker in the leftist media.
[00:04:49.714 --> 00:05:00.703]  And it's no wonder when you've seen these celebrities and these people all coming out speaking out and speaking out against President Trump.
[00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:13.190]  Now if we do a little bit of a flashback here, Tim Kaine not too long ago had actually spoken and said that people needed to fight in the streets in resistance to President Trump.
[00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.654]  And now here you see we have GOP members that were shot.
[00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:20.955]  Badly injured.
[00:05:20.995 --> 00:05:22.756]  It could have been so much worse.
[00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:27.876]  There could have been a massive tragedy here where we saw a lot of people dead.
[00:05:28.257 --> 00:05:31.297]  But thank goodness that some people were carrying guns.
[00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:40.939]  And if you're wondering why more people were not carrying guns, more of these representatives weren't, it's because of the strict gun laws where they live.
[00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.039]  The majority of them live in D.C.
[00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:46.060]  and therefore they cannot have guns in D.C.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:57.347]  But what's interesting is we had even seen Loretta Lynch who had called for progressives to march, bleed and die in resistance to President Trump.
[00:05:57.707 --> 00:06:03.331]  So we've had some pretty radical leftists out there calling for violence.
[00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:08.295]  So is it any wonder that now we're seeing people going and shooting up
[00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:12.456]  I mean, this is ridiculous, guys.
[00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:14.118]  We're seeing people die.
[00:06:14.138 --> 00:06:21.827]  I mean, thank goodness that nobody died during this, but it was a close call.
[00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:24.490]  We're lucky that that bullet happened to hit
[00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:31.275]  Representative Scalise in the hip and not somewhere else where it could have been fatal.
[00:06:31.355 --> 00:06:34.257]  It was a serious, serious injury.
[00:06:34.637 --> 00:06:42.962]  Now, what's also interesting is that this attack was most definitely inspired by the media.
[00:06:42.982 --> 00:06:54.369]  I mean, the media has been perpetuating this myth, this idea that Trump has been colluding with the Russians, that Trump is comparable to Hitler.
[00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:04.695]  So it's seriously no wonder that you see these leftists out there, you know, going up and trying to shoot someone and kill someone.
[00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:12.920]  They actually believe it's that serious that they need to go and kill somebody urgently to try and, you know, stop this Hitler regime from happening.
[00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:14.862]  My goodness, it's not anything like this.
[00:07:15.362 --> 00:07:16.523]  It's called propaganda.
[00:07:16.623 --> 00:07:17.824]  It's called being misled.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:28.762]  Now what's interesting here is leftists were quick to then criticize the GOP because they know that the GOP, they are supporters of the NRA.
[00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:34.663]  So some of these tweets were, Steve Scalise has A-plus NRA rating.
[00:07:35.223 --> 00:07:39.824]  Advid Gunn supporter hope he appreciates this display of Second Amendment rights.
[00:07:40.304 --> 00:07:45.805]  So we have these leftists, they're just being so cold, they don't even care, they're going to start mocking
[00:07:46.525 --> 00:08:03.665]  These these people that were shot that were terrified but in reality Rand Paul was interviewed and he witnessed it and he said if it had not been for a gun the fact that Capitol Police
[00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:20.128]  Prevented this massacre if none of them had had guns there then this this gunman this assailant would have just had open play I mean the guy came with ton he came with a semi-automatic rifle and he had tons of reload of ammo and
[00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:24.031]  And he could have done serious, serious damage.
[00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:26.153]  Now, this is kind of interesting here.
[00:08:26.213 --> 00:08:31.596]  This Virginia governor claims he came out and did a press conference after all of this.
[00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.097]  And of course, he's a Democrat.
[00:08:33.497 --> 00:08:40.722]  But what's kind of funny here is he claimed that 93 million Americans die from guns every day.
[00:08:41.302 --> 00:08:46.946]  Well, I'm wondering if he's using common core math to derive that figure there because
[00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:53.798]  Given that there's 300 and something million Americans that would not make sense to have 93 million Americans die every day.
[00:08:54.218 --> 00:08:56.282]  So let's go ahead and roll this clip because it's pretty funny.
[00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:59.749]  Do you think anything more needs to do to protect politicians?
[00:09:00.953 --> 00:09:01.954]  Well, let me say this.
[00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:04.775]  I think we need to do more to protect all of our citizens.
[00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:10.498]  I have long advocated, this is not what today is about, but there are too many guns on the street.
[00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:15.201]  We lose 93 million Americans a day to gun violence.
[00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.762]  I mean, I've long talked about this.
[00:09:17.142 --> 00:09:19.383]  Background checks, shutting down gun show loopholes.
[00:09:19.823 --> 00:09:21.364]  That's not for today's discussion.
[00:09:21.664 --> 00:09:23.525]  But it's not just about politicians.
[00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:26.327]  We worry about this every day for all of our citizens.
[00:09:27.372 --> 00:09:33.455]  Now this was Governor Terry McAleith, and he was the one who said this, which is pretty funny.
[00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:38.137]  It's a little bit of a blooper, but that's completely exaggerated, obviously.
[00:09:38.157 --> 00:09:42.899]  Well, what's interesting also is I wanted to read this quick quote from Rand Paul.
[00:09:42.939 --> 00:09:52.024]  He says, I can tell you that I think with absolute certainty nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill Police.
[00:09:52.544 --> 00:09:56.546]  They saved everyone's life, incredibly brave, and they deserve everyone's
[00:09:56.906 --> 00:09:57.366]  Praise.
[00:09:57.686 --> 00:10:05.551]  So, without these brave heroes that had firearms, we could have seen Rand Paul dead.
[00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:09.773]  A lot of these other representatives dead.
[00:10:10.134 --> 00:10:11.895]  Steve Scalise dead.
[00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:16.577]  I mean, that is just absolutely shocking and mind-boggling.
[00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:20.399]  There was so much crossfire that was going on.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.162]  You could hear it was just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, non-stop gunfire going on.
[00:10:25.202 --> 00:10:26.003]  This guy came
[00:10:26.923 --> 00:10:32.907]  With the intention to wipe out these politicians, essentially.
[00:10:33.327 --> 00:10:41.252]  Now what's interesting is that CNN tried to justify the violence against these Republicans.
[00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:42.113]  It was kind of interesting.
[00:10:43.154 --> 00:10:54.881]  Host Wolf Blitzer was interviewing this gunman's friend, and this friend says that, you know, the gunman was not evil, he just was sick and tired of the politics.
[00:10:54.941 --> 00:10:55.102]  Well,
[00:10:56.374 --> 00:10:57.414]  That's ridiculous.
[00:10:57.934 --> 00:11:01.255]  Why didn't Wolf Blitzer speak out and say, no, give me a break.
[00:11:01.675 --> 00:11:10.377]  You have to be evil in order to go out there with the intention to kill people, to mow people down, to traumatize families.
[00:11:10.457 --> 00:11:15.038]  I mean, for every person you see out there, you can imagine they all have families.
[00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:16.758]  A lot of them have children.
[00:11:17.219 --> 00:11:19.119]  It's completely wrong.
[00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:23.040]  It doesn't matter if somebody disagrees with you ideologically.
[00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:36.185]  Now what's interesting here is that now GOP lawmakers are calling for Congress members to have concealed carry licenses and the ability to carry in D.C.
[00:11:36.586 --> 00:11:43.212]  A lot of them work in D.C., they live in D.C., or not necessarily live in D.C., but a lot of them work in D.C.
[00:11:43.232 --> 00:11:45.655]  and they have to be in D.C., and it is a major risk
[00:11:47.396 --> 00:11:48.876]  For them to be going there.
[00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:50.017]  They are public figures.
[00:11:50.077 --> 00:12:11.782]  They receive death threats in the mail or over social media or maybe even in person so they should be able to have a concealed carry and this was Republican representative Barry Loudermilk who's been the the person who's really been calling for this and for lawmakers to be able to conceal a
[00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:40.223]  To conceal carry firearms in the nation's capital because the only reason why this this assailant was stopped was because Scalise had had private security there that were carrying and usually like somebody like Rand Paul a lot of these other GOP members they don't typically have private security on them but because Scalise is a higher ranking
[00:12:41.275 --> 00:12:43.777]  member of the GOP, he typically did.
[00:12:44.118 --> 00:12:50.363]  So what they're saying is if it had not been for Scalise, there would have been a lot more deaths and a lot more carnage.
[00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:57.598]  Well, there's really so much here guys, but just remember the mainstream media has been spinning this.
[00:12:57.658 --> 00:13:06.123]  They've been perpetuating this violence against Trump, the violence against Trump supporters, violence against Republicans, GOP members.
[00:13:06.463 --> 00:13:07.544]  It's only going to get worse.
[00:13:07.604 --> 00:13:15.529]  It's only going to escalate because how many people do you see Democrats out there calling for this to stop, for this violence to stop?
[00:13:16.289 --> 00:13:18.211]  I haven't been seeing it at all on social media.
[00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:35.818]  It's pretty disturbing that we're not seeing that, but just remember InfoWars is still having this $200,000 in cash prizes for the Operation Exposed terrorist media and Kathy Griffin, so make sure you go and get your CNN is ISIS t-shirts.
[00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:41.681]  Go out there in front of these mainstream media perpetrators of propaganda
[00:13:42.441 --> 00:13:43.782]  And photobomb them.
[00:13:44.742 --> 00:13:48.684]  Go out there and show them that, you know, people know that they're fake.
[00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:51.385]  People know that it's fraud.
[00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:54.066]  But unfortunately, not enough people do.
[00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:57.988]  And people believe their hysteria, that they perpetuate.
[00:13:58.268 --> 00:13:59.328]  And then you have mass shootings.
[00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:02.970]  So guys, stick around because up next we have some awesome reports.
[00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:07.132]  One from John Bound, where he talks about this leftist lunacy.
[00:14:12.975 --> 00:14:19.740]  Days ago, a standing ovation for the simulation of the assassination of the President of the United States.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:27.165]  And now a baseball practice loaded with Republican congressmen and staffers became a live mass shooting event.
[00:14:27.305 --> 00:14:37.712]  James T. Hodgkinson was identified as the shooter that railed off over 50 shots at the 100-year-old traditional practice baseball event that included children.
[00:14:37.852 --> 00:14:39.793]  He was killed by Capitol Police.
[00:14:43.894 --> 00:14:58.866]  A member of House leadership was shot and badly wounded and is now in stable condition at the hospital along with two very courageous Capitol Police officers.
[00:14:59.367 --> 00:15:03.450]  And all of this occurring ominously on President Donald Trump's 71st birthday.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:10.463]  I can tell you that I think with absolute certainty nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill Police.
[00:15:10.523 --> 00:15:11.743]  They saved everybody's life.
[00:15:12.864 --> 00:15:19.707]  Incredibly brave and deserve everyone's praise because with this guy, who knows how heavily armed he was.
[00:15:22.408 --> 00:15:25.109]  Nobody else had a weapon, so he was just killing everyone.
[00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:29.531]  I didn't exactly know where the shots were coming from, but it was loud.
[00:15:30.372 --> 00:15:32.293]  It was constant.
[00:15:32.313 --> 00:15:35.914]  So, I actually ran and jumped in the dugout.
[00:15:35.954 --> 00:15:37.015]  That's when I got stuffed up.
[00:15:37.035 --> 00:15:37.475]  I'm sorry.
[00:15:37.755 --> 00:15:38.876]  That's when I got stuffed up.
[00:15:38.916 --> 00:15:43.218]  And when I got in the dugout, we realized the shooter was still active.
[00:15:43.398 --> 00:15:46.239]  There was a child in the dugout, because children come out and watch us play.
[00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:53.558]  But the house majority whip, Scalise, was shot in the hip and transported to the hospital along with four others.
[00:15:53.699 --> 00:16:01.469]  Before details of Hodgkinson's identity were even available, Virginia Governor McAuliffe clumsily called for gun control.
[00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.651]  We have too many guns on the street.
[00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:08.374]  We lose 93 million Americans a day to gun violence.
[00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:09.854]  I mean, I've long talked about this.
[00:16:10.315 --> 00:16:12.436]  Background checks, shutting down gun show loopholes.
[00:16:12.976 --> 00:16:14.517]  That's not for today's discussion.
[00:16:14.817 --> 00:16:16.678]  But it's not just about politicians.
[00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:19.520]  We worry about this every day for all of our citizens.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.081]  So we've got to look at this.
[00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:23.022]  But I'm not going to get anywhere near the investigation.
[00:16:23.042 --> 00:16:24.363]  The FBI is leading this.
[00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:27.965]  But this, obviously, with 93 million people a day, it's just something
[00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:30.726]  Sir, just checking, 93 million is a big number.
[00:16:30.746 --> 00:16:32.146]  Did you mean to say 93 million?
[00:16:32.166 --> 00:16:32.867]  That's a big number.
[00:16:32.887 --> 00:16:33.787]  Are you sure about that?
[00:16:33.807 --> 00:16:36.168]  93 million... 93 individuals a day.
[00:16:36.388 --> 00:16:47.012]  The Belleville News Democrats reports Hodgkinson is a member of a number of anti-Republican groups on Facebook, including one called Terminate the Republican Party.
[00:16:47.472 --> 00:16:51.533]  Hodgkinson took a Democratic ballot in the primary election in 2016.
[00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:58.434]  Hodgkinson's Facebook page clearly shows that he was a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[00:16:58.654 --> 00:17:04.435]  The story was less than an hour old before the left's violent rhetoric was unleashed.
[00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:14.657]  Tariq Nasheed said, So Representative Steve Scalise, who once spoke at a white supremacist event sponsored by David Duke, Google it,
[00:17:15.177 --> 00:17:17.158]  was shot today in Alexandria.
[00:17:17.438 --> 00:17:20.359]  Twitter user Malcolm Harris said, Sonia Gupta tweeted,
[00:17:36.405 --> 00:17:37.546]  And a hateful bigot.
[00:17:37.866 --> 00:17:46.853]  Technology writer Waltisfrozen said the attack will have a silver lining if the shooter was indeed targeting Republicans specifically.
[00:17:47.113 --> 00:17:52.998]  Twitter user Joe Quint said, Steve Scalise was shot in the hip in Alexandria, Virginia.
[00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:56.261]  It's as if karma literally bit him in the ass.
[00:17:56.781 --> 00:17:58.203]  How far will this go?
[00:17:58.483 --> 00:18:05.892]  The left is collectively and publicly embracing homicide as a political solution.
[00:18:05.912 --> 00:18:06.452]  They marched.
[00:18:06.813 --> 00:18:07.393]  They bled.
[00:18:07.854 --> 00:18:09.296]  Yes, some of them have died.
[00:18:09.736 --> 00:18:10.877]  This is hard.
[00:18:11.518 --> 00:18:12.479]  Every good thing is.
[00:18:13.464 --> 00:18:14.545]  We have done this before.
[00:18:14.565 --> 00:18:15.946]  We can do this again.
[00:18:15.966 --> 00:18:20.089]  This is not the first time someone in the public eye has been encouraging violence against Trump.
[00:18:20.489 --> 00:18:25.292]  Just last week, a Guardian columnist tweeted that it's about time for a presidential assassination.
[00:18:26.073 --> 00:18:33.318]  CEO Matt Harrigan went on an unhinged tirade, posting that he was going to kill the president-elect using a sniper rifle.
[00:18:33.658 --> 00:18:46.236]  We can start by following Hungary's lead and passing laws to rid our country of the hundreds of millions of dollars George Soros is pouring in to set us on an inevitable path towards civil war.
[00:18:46.497 --> 00:18:48.520]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:19:01.664 --> 00:19:07.728]  Thanks to your support, InfoWars has been able to expand its operations against the globalists at this critical time.
[00:19:08.028 --> 00:19:15.733]  And it's absolutely essential that we expand in the face of the enemy, because as history shows, political movements only expand or contract.
[00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:19.656]  And that's why the globalists are hitting us with everything they've got.
[00:19:19.976 --> 00:19:23.579]  Censorship, demonization, attacks, misrepresentations.
[00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:25.640]  They're not just trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.101]  They're trying to fire Sean Hannity.
[00:19:27.522 --> 00:19:28.943]  They're trying to cold talk radio.
[00:19:28.983 --> 00:19:34.227]  They're trying to silence true, independent, nationalistic media.
[00:19:34.608 --> 00:19:38.090]  And InfoWars is at the very heart of that resistance.
[00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:49.680]  We all see the dumbed-down trendies that appear to be soulless and how they're obsessed with consumerism and criticizing capitalism as they walk around in their expensive Nike tennis shoes and have their slave-made iPhones.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.283]  So, I personally am disgusted by empty consumerism.
[00:19:54.073 --> 00:20:09.303]  But the globalists want to get rid of free markets because there is such a thing as positive consumerism historically, where people can use the power they have of the purse to actually support building free and independent economies.
[00:20:09.824 --> 00:20:13.006]  So you're not just getting amazing products when you go to InfoWarshaw.com.

[00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:27.447]  In closing, we've already come this far together and we've seen the devastating effects truth has against the global crime syndicate.
[00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:29.008]  But the enemy's striking back.
[00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:34.650]  So again, from myself, the entire InfoWars crew, I want to salute and thank all of you.
[00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:39.952]  No matter what color you are or where you came from, if the love of liberty and justice beats in your heart,
[00:21:40.652 --> 00:21:44.754]  Give the love of standing up against tyrants flows through your veins.
[00:21:44.794 --> 00:21:50.196]  We are all brothers and sisters together in this epic experiment that is life.
[00:21:50.837 --> 00:21:52.697]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[00:21:53.037 --> 00:22:00.601]  Visit InfoWarsTour.com today to get some of the best deals ever offered on incredible nutraceuticals, supplements, and so much more.
[00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:03.604]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:22:03.764 --> 00:22:10.228]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:22:10.368 --> 00:22:22.957]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:22:23.317 --> 00:22:23.917]  Caveman.
[00:22:24.157 --> 00:22:29.161]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:22:29.221 --> 00:22:31.342]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:34.744]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:22:34.784 --> 00:22:39.566]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:22:39.927 --> 00:22:47.671]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:22:48.071 --> 00:22:55.935]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:22:56.015 --> 00:23:00.678]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself at InfoWarsLive.com today.
[00:23:11.892 --> 00:23:14.113]  David Knight here, and I want to talk to Lee Stranahan.
[00:23:14.133 --> 00:23:15.573]  He's based out of Washington, D.C.
[00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:20.335]  He was really the first in the media to be on site at this shooting.
[00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:21.795]  He was the first on the scene.
[00:23:21.835 --> 00:23:23.296]  He was doing a live Periscope.
[00:23:23.356 --> 00:23:26.577]  He was the featured Periscope earlier today.
[00:23:26.797 --> 00:23:32.459]  I want to talk to him about what he saw there, the interviews that he had with congressmen and people who were witnesses to the event.
[00:23:32.899 --> 00:23:38.581]  We also want to talk a little bit about where we draw the line on free speech, as well as Second Amendment issues that come up.
[00:23:38.662 --> 00:23:40.222]  So joining us now is Lee Stranahan.
[00:23:40.242 --> 00:23:44.364]  You can find him, he's the editor of ThePopulist.us.
[00:23:44.404 --> 00:23:49.566]  He's also co-host of Fault Lines on Sputnik, and you can find him on Twitter, at Stranahan.
[00:23:49.586 --> 00:23:50.447]  Thank you for joining us, Lee.
[00:23:50.467 --> 00:23:52.427]  David, thanks so much for having me.
[00:23:52.447 --> 00:23:55.849]  I really appreciate being able to talk to the InfoWars audience about this.
[00:23:56.209 --> 00:23:59.170]  Well, it's great to have somebody there who is really the first on the scene from the media.
[00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.611]  Tell us what you saw when you arrived.
[00:24:01.775 --> 00:24:08.383]  Sure, well I happen to live about 10 minutes away from where the shooting happened, so I was kind of dressed casually.
[00:24:08.423 --> 00:24:11.706]  This morning I was not dressed like this, because it's miserably hot.
[00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:16.312]  So as soon as we saw the shooting break, and I say that knowing you're in Austin.
[00:24:16.892 --> 00:24:17.793]  Uh, but it's really hot.
[00:24:17.893 --> 00:24:22.899]  It's Austin hot in D.C., so we headed down there immediately to the scene.
[00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:28.245]  Uh, and there was no media there, but the police had already cordoned it off.
[00:24:28.765 --> 00:24:36.073]  Now, uh, I talked to a couple of witnesses, and the situation, and what I warned people on the periscope is, you never know
[00:24:37.054 --> 00:24:40.757]  As these situations evolve, what's a fact and what's not?
[00:24:40.797 --> 00:24:46.341]  You know, people say there's three shooters, and it turns out three people saw one shooter, right?
[00:24:46.782 --> 00:24:53.947]  So, it turned out that everything I reported pretty much was... ended up being accurate, but we got lucky on that.
[00:24:54.388 --> 00:24:56.609]  Which is, it turned out the shooter had been killed.
[00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.931]  We now knew that.
[00:24:59.812 --> 00:25:05.857]  It turned out that there had been five people shot, four of whom were victims and one of whom was the shooter.
[00:25:07.398 --> 00:25:13.763]  But when I talk to witnesses, I talk to a gentleman who's a manager of a coffee shop, and he said he saw people fleeing.
[00:25:13.783 --> 00:25:16.705]  You have to remember, this is a nice area.
[00:25:16.745 --> 00:25:18.847]  People walk their dogs down there, right?
[00:25:19.388 --> 00:25:22.250]  And this happened very early in the morning.
[00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.733]  It happened about 7-10, 7-15 in the morning.
[00:25:27.194 --> 00:25:30.897]  One thing that's obvious is that the police were on the scene right away.
[00:25:30.957 --> 00:25:33.439]  They handled the situation very quickly.
[00:25:33.459 --> 00:25:35.721]  Do you have any idea how long it took them to get to the scene?
[00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:37.691]  Yeah, I asked about that.
[00:25:37.751 --> 00:25:44.914]  It seemed like it took about three minutes before the officers showed up and other people showed up as well.
[00:25:45.354 --> 00:26:01.078]  And I'll tell you, we interviewed Mo Brooks, who's the congressman from Alabama, and Brooks said, basically, thank God that Steve Scalise is in the line of secession for the president.
[00:26:01.158 --> 00:26:02.779]  The reason he said that is because
[00:26:04.051 --> 00:26:10.375]  If this had just been a few regular congresspeople and senators, there would not have been security detail there.
[00:26:10.395 --> 00:26:11.456]  You with me?
[00:26:11.816 --> 00:26:12.537]  That's right.
[00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:18.981]  Because even congressmen in the District of Columbia are not allowed to carry firearms.
[00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:20.022]  They or their staff.
[00:26:20.062 --> 00:26:31.930]  And we had a Michigan representative, Mike Bishop, said, look, if this had happened back in Georgia, I've got people on my staff who are carrying, if they'd seen this guy, they might have stopped him before he even shot anybody.
[00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.495]  But that's not allowed in the District of Columbia.
[00:26:35.096 --> 00:26:35.818]  No, it's not.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.570]  And even though we're in Virginia, which is slightly different, you know, these are people who are coming...
[00:26:42.745 --> 00:26:47.489]  You've got to understand, you're literally about 12 minutes across the Potomac from D.C., right?
[00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.973]  So, you don't want to be carrying.
[00:26:51.013 --> 00:26:52.374]  Does that make sense?
[00:26:52.454 --> 00:26:53.115]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:53.155 --> 00:26:56.558]  We see this happen to people all the time who are used to carrying concealed.
[00:26:56.598 --> 00:26:59.400]  They go to the airport and they forget, oh, I've got this gun still on me.
[00:26:59.601 --> 00:27:04.225]  If you get used to doing it, then you get entrapped when you get into one of these gun-free zones.
[00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:22.536]  By the way, I saw David Frum, who's a conservative, who was saying, he was saying, he pointed out very astutely, clearly he's a big firearms expert, that in Virginia, concealed carrying a rifle is permitted.
[00:27:23.876 --> 00:27:25.437]  Concealed carrying a rifle.
[00:27:26.477 --> 00:27:32.319]  Well, I guess, you know, as they said on CNN, he had an M1, so I guess if you can fit that M1 under your coat, you can carry it legally, huh?
[00:27:33.903 --> 00:27:38.606]  You're seeing some of the footage from the periscope that my sons and I shot out there.
[00:27:38.646 --> 00:27:40.848]  We went out and we interviewed people.
[00:27:41.308 --> 00:27:48.852]  One of the things I asked David, and look, the way I do reporting, I try not to do any conjecture, particularly in a breaking story like this.
[00:27:49.253 --> 00:27:55.757]  So until I knew who, I asked a question which I still have not heard the answer to, which is,
[00:27:56.477 --> 00:28:00.803]  How did the shooter know that these guys were playing baseball there?
[00:28:01.063 --> 00:28:01.744]  Does that make sense?
[00:28:01.764 --> 00:28:02.665]  Yeah, because he's from out of town.
[00:28:02.705 --> 00:28:03.366]  He's from Illinois.
[00:28:04.027 --> 00:28:04.928]  That's exactly right.
[00:28:04.948 --> 00:28:07.231]  And I didn't know they were... How did he know?
[00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:08.112]  I don't know how he knew.
[00:28:09.397 --> 00:28:11.119]  But I'm curious to find that out.
[00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:13.060]  Hopefully in the fullness of time we'll find that out.
[00:28:13.421 --> 00:28:15.623]  But when Mo Burns was there, he was shaken up.
[00:28:15.703 --> 00:28:17.044]  He was obviously shaken up.
[00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:20.748]  But he did a very good job of explaining what happened and what he saw.
[00:28:26.673 --> 00:28:33.797]  And really harrowing, harrowing story, right, of seeing Scalise dragging himself across the baseball field.
[00:28:34.137 --> 00:28:48.146]  But I asked him, I said, given the, and again, this is without conjecture of who'd done the shooting, but given the fact that we saw Snoop Dogg in a music video shoot the president, and we saw Kathy Griffin with the beheaded head of Donald Trump,
[00:28:48.706 --> 00:28:50.607]  Does he think there's an atmosphere of violence?
[00:28:50.667 --> 00:29:12.501]  And David, one thing I want to talk about here is you know and I know that if this were the right, if this guy had a picture, not of Bernie Sanders, but of Alex Jones, or Donald Trump, the media would spend the next five days talking about right-wing violence, right?
[00:29:13.542 --> 00:29:14.622]  That's what they would talk about.
[00:29:16.502 --> 00:29:22.985]  The left, and I know this because I'm a student of history, and I did a film Steve Bannon directed called Occupy Unmasked.
[00:29:23.386 --> 00:29:30.129]  I'm currently directing the sequel to that, where we talk about the Black Panther movement and how it bleeds into Black Lives Matter.
[00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:36.633]  I know there's a history of violence at the left that the left media never talks about.
[00:29:36.973 --> 00:29:39.174]  For instance, I talked about this with Black Lives Matter.
[00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:40.335]  You and I have talked about it before.
[00:29:40.715 --> 00:29:44.797]  Assata Shakur, a convicted murderer, is a hero of the Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:29:45.257 --> 00:29:48.318]  I have never heard the mainstream media mention that one time.
[00:29:48.398 --> 00:29:49.978]  Not once, ever.
[00:29:51.599 --> 00:30:01.862]  So, it's very interesting to me that as of, you know, when the immediate news came out, we know who the killer is, they didn't show the fact he's got a big smiling picture of Bernie Sanders.
[00:30:01.922 --> 00:30:05.763]  Now, that being said, is this Bernie Sanders' fault?
[00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.871]  No, I'm not saying that.
[00:30:25.504 --> 00:30:28.825]  Comprehensive the statement is, they would continue to ask him that.
[00:30:29.285 --> 00:30:38.029]  And I think it's interesting also, we've had others who come out here, they clearly got the idea that they should, got this ever-increasing heated rhetoric.
[00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:44.251]  We had Loretta Lynch, if you remember, said that progressives need to march, bleed and die in the streets.
[00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:45.872]  So they're getting right up to that line.
[00:30:45.892 --> 00:30:48.573]  I want to play a real quick clip for you and get your reaction here.
[00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:50.374]  This was earlier today on CNN.
[00:30:50.414 --> 00:30:53.995]  They talked to someone who knew this shooter and here's what he had to say.
[00:30:55.859 --> 00:31:07.485]  We're just getting some tape in of an acquaintance of James Hodgkinson, the 66-year-old shooter, describing some of his political, perhaps, motivations.
[00:31:07.545 --> 00:31:08.045]  Listen to this.
[00:31:09.405 --> 00:31:12.307]  I just want to let people know that he wasn't evil.
[00:31:13.447 --> 00:31:17.069]  That he was, I guess, tired of some of the politics that are going on.
[00:31:18.677 --> 00:31:19.557]  That's what we just heard.
[00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:22.939]  Perhaps he wasn't evil, just tired of the politics that's going on.
[00:31:22.959 --> 00:31:23.499]  There you go.
[00:31:23.639 --> 00:31:28.142]  So that brings up a real First Amendment issue as to where do we take our speech?
[00:31:28.182 --> 00:31:31.323]  Certainly we can have a vigorous, even heated debate.
[00:31:31.704 --> 00:31:33.665]  We can be passionate about our ideas.
[00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.706]  At what point do we cross the line?
[00:31:35.746 --> 00:31:39.628]  At what point do we normalize violence, if not incite violence?
[00:31:39.688 --> 00:31:48.392]  And it's not just, you know, it's all these artists like you're talking about, you know, pointing guns, cutting off heads, having staged assassinations of Donald Trump.
[00:31:48.712 --> 00:31:49.533]  Well, first off, I'm a Christian.
[00:32:08.331 --> 00:32:09.712]  And I wasn't always a Christian.
[00:32:09.772 --> 00:32:16.114]  Before I was a Christian, and I used to be on the left, you don't really believe in good and evil.
[00:32:16.194 --> 00:32:25.478]  I think this is actually one of the fundamental differences between liberals and conservatives, and in particular, between Christians and non-Christians.
[00:32:25.518 --> 00:32:27.258]  I'm not even taking a debate on that.
[00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:30.820]  But just this idea that there is such a thing as good and evil,
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:32.921]  That's an excellent point.
[00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:38.423]  They couldn't bring themselves to say, hey, no matter how heinous the crime, we can't call it evil.
[00:32:38.483 --> 00:32:39.644]  We've got to take a quick break.
[00:32:39.684 --> 00:32:46.047]  That's the end of this segment, but if you want to see the rest of this interview, you can watch it on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:32:46.287 --> 00:32:49.789]  We'll be right back for those of you watching on the internet with Lee Stranahan.
[00:33:02.628 --> 00:33:03.969]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:04.989]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:06.569]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.690]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.610]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.211]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.411 --> 00:33:13.132]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.172 --> 00:33:16.753]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.993 --> 00:33:23.836]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.312]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.345]  My morning was fantastic, and I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:50.289]  I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.997]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.037 --> 00:36:58.798]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.919 --> 00:36:59.880]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:06.013 --> 00:37:07.914]  David Knight here with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:37:07.954 --> 00:37:08.754]  He's here in Austin.
[00:37:08.794 --> 00:37:10.115]  He's our Washington, D.C.
[00:37:10.155 --> 00:37:10.635]  bureau chief.
[00:37:11.135 --> 00:37:14.316]  But today he's here working on the setup of that bureau.
[00:37:14.817 --> 00:37:21.119]  And I want to talk to Dr. Corsi about what we just saw there and about a clip that I saw earlier today on CNN.
[00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:26.521]  I think, Dr. Corsi, the issue here is where does the line on free speech drawn?
[00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:29.202]  Do we allow people to incite violence?
[00:37:29.262 --> 00:37:31.443]  And we're going to play a clip for you from CNN.
[00:37:31.643 --> 00:37:35.685]  Absolutely amazing what was said and the non-reaction from Wolfsburg.
[00:37:36.566 --> 00:37:40.569]  Well, David, this is not what the First Amendment's about.
[00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:44.492]  The First Amendment is about the ability to express any ideas.
[00:37:44.652 --> 00:37:50.077]  I mean, you can certainly object to the policies of the Trump administration.
[00:37:50.777 --> 00:37:53.699]  You can't, though, call for violence.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.062]  You can't say, you know, we're inciting, we want people to
[00:37:58.243 --> 00:38:02.667]  Imitate us with, you know, shooting water guns at Donald Trump or beheadings.
[00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:04.629]  These are crossing the line.
[00:38:04.709 --> 00:38:13.196]  These are sending out a disinformation type of message to people out there who may not be emotionally stable.
[00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:14.697]  And you can see that in those clips.
[00:38:14.737 --> 00:38:15.718]  They're escalating it.
[00:38:15.798 --> 00:38:17.599]  You know, first it's criticism, which is fine.
[00:38:17.639 --> 00:38:24.344]  We understand people have strong criticism of politicians, and certainly we do that here at InfoWars, but we don't incite violence.
[00:38:24.384 --> 00:38:24.965]  We shouldn't do that.
[00:38:25.185 --> 00:38:29.328]  People should call us on that just as they would call us on an inaccuracy or whatever.
[00:38:29.348 --> 00:38:30.729]  We should never incite violence.
[00:38:30.749 --> 00:38:34.772]  That's the difference between shouting fire in a crowded theater, you know.
[00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:42.318]  That's not free speech to do that as a false alarm, and it's not free speech for these people to get up and use their podium in a theater
[00:38:42.978 --> 00:38:51.190]  To say, fire at my political enemies and act out this violence, just as we saw in the clip there of the theater in the park in New York.
[00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:58.540]  They're using the bard as a beard for their incitement of violence and saying, hey, it's just Shakespeare.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:08.986]  Well, the classic definition of free speech is you have to tolerate speech that you don't want to hear, that is offensive to you or you don't like an opinion.
[00:39:09.827 --> 00:39:18.132]  But as long as it's an opinion, as long as I'm stating a view, I'm saying I think this about a public policy, you're permitted to do that.
[00:39:18.992 --> 00:39:22.634]  Now, we've got to understand the classic techniques of disinformation.
[00:39:22.814 --> 00:39:43.702]  Once you begin to desensitize a population, that violence is acceptable, and you're doing it through these act-out scenes, which are really, you know, play imitation, but they're communicating a message that you're desensitized, so it's okay to have violence against the Trump administration.
[00:39:43.722 --> 00:39:45.103]  And look at the left.
[00:39:45.143 --> 00:39:45.703]  I mean, the left is
[00:39:46.323 --> 00:39:47.764]  It's completely intolerant.
[00:39:47.804 --> 00:39:54.830]  They don't want to hear speech, even in pure speech policy terms, that they disagree with.
[00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:55.251]  That's right.
[00:39:55.511 --> 00:39:56.151]  They're intolerant.
[00:39:56.171 --> 00:39:57.152]  They want to shut that down.
[00:39:57.172 --> 00:40:03.638]  You see that in universities, where universities are determined to have safe spaces and speakers who
[00:40:04.218 --> 00:40:06.940]  disagree with their leftist ideology.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:17.027]  I mean, this now has crossed over into a form of Marxism, a form of socialism or communism, which is completely antithetic to free speech.
[00:40:17.367 --> 00:40:18.788]  I want to play for you the clip.
[00:40:19.008 --> 00:40:30.116]  You haven't seen this clip from CNN, because I think the whole point that you're making here, how they've become desensitized to the violence, the question is, has CNN, has Wolf Blitzer become desensitized to the violence?
[00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:31.257]  They talk to a person.
[00:40:31.277 --> 00:40:32.498]  We're going to play this clip for you.
[00:40:32.538 --> 00:40:33.679]  I think we've got that ready now.
[00:40:34.139 --> 00:40:42.902]  We're going to play this clip for you where they go out and they find somebody who knows this shooter and I want you to see what he says and I want you to see their reactions.
[00:40:42.942 --> 00:40:43.502]  Here's that clip.
[00:40:44.222 --> 00:40:45.483]  Alright, stand by Art.
[00:40:45.503 --> 00:40:57.266]  We're just getting some tape in of an acquaintance of James Hodgkinson, the 66-year-old shooter, describing some of his political, perhaps, motivations.
[00:40:57.306 --> 00:40:57.806]  Listen to this.
[00:40:59.187 --> 00:41:02.068]  I just want to let people know that he wasn't evil.
[00:41:03.283 --> 00:41:04.464]  That's what we just heard.
[00:41:04.484 --> 00:41:07.006]  Perhaps he wasn't evil, just tired of the politics going on.
[00:41:07.026 --> 00:41:09.087]  There we go.
[00:41:09.127 --> 00:41:09.468]  That's it.
[00:41:09.488 --> 00:41:09.588]  No, no.
[00:41:19.822 --> 00:41:20.763]  No pushback against that.
[00:41:21.303 --> 00:41:25.884]  And of course, if I was a reporter there, I would have a question about that.
[00:41:26.265 --> 00:41:31.286]  If he said, well he wasn't evil, he just shot a bunch of people who were unarmed playing baseball.
[00:41:31.726 --> 00:41:33.527]  I don't care about what his politics are.
[00:41:33.747 --> 00:41:36.168]  I don't care that he's tired of hearing about politics.
[00:41:36.408 --> 00:41:38.229]  You don't pick up a gun and start shooting.
[00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:43.310]  And if somebody says something like that, why doesn't the reporter on the scene question him about what do you mean that's not evil?
[00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:45.111]  Why doesn't Wolf Blitzer say that?
[00:41:45.151 --> 00:41:47.812]  Instead, they're desensitized as they're desensitized.
[00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:51.655]  Well, it's a shocking clip.
[00:41:51.855 --> 00:42:11.110]  I mean, when you see CNN really, in a sense, endorsing that because someone doesn't like the politics of Donald Trump, it's excusable that they take a gun and go and try to kill congressmen, firing 50 rounds to try to kill a bunch of defenseless congressmen playing baseball.
[00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:21.957]  But see, all of a sudden it becomes acceptable in the left's view for Wolf Blitzer to say these outrageous things or not to object.
[00:42:22.117 --> 00:42:23.178]  Or to say nothing at all.
[00:42:25.259 --> 00:42:27.801]  In the left's view it is de-legitimate.
[00:42:27.841 --> 00:42:30.222]  Everything Donald Trump does is de-legitimate.
[00:42:30.263 --> 00:42:31.784]  They don't accept the presidency.
[00:42:31.804 --> 00:42:33.024]  They don't accept that they lost.
[00:42:33.485 --> 00:42:35.646]  In other words, it's the same thing as they do on campuses.
[00:42:36.126 --> 00:42:39.489]  If you're not articulating the left's ideology,
[00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:41.570]  You can't be permitted to speak.
[00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.731]  You're going to be criminalized.
[00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:46.053]  Same thing that the communist Chinese did with thought reform.
[00:42:46.593 --> 00:42:49.815]  You're going to be put into a camp until you think right.
[00:42:50.255 --> 00:42:52.316]  And you can see it all the time with the left.
[00:42:52.356 --> 00:42:58.560]  I mean, they wanted to criminalize anyone who doubted that there was a climate change.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.381]  Well, first of all, they had global warming.
[00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:06.424]  The data did not support the Earth as warming up, so they morphed it, and now it's climate change.
[00:43:06.444 --> 00:43:08.606]  But again... We've got to hide the decline, they said.
[00:43:09.326 --> 00:43:12.930]  It's ideology, it's ideology, and you're not allowed to oppose that.
[00:43:13.411 --> 00:43:21.100]  And if someone starts shooting or imprisoning climate deniers in the left's view, that's completely okay.
[00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:22.902]  Because you're illegitimate.
[00:43:24.224 --> 00:43:25.104]  He wasn't tired of politics.
[00:43:25.124 --> 00:43:25.624]  It was his religion.
[00:43:46.872 --> 00:43:50.074]  And so, to him, it was okay to take action this way.
[00:43:50.134 --> 00:43:54.476]  That's the amazing thing to me, that they would not have any reaction, that that would not be something that they would question.
[00:43:54.496 --> 00:43:57.757]  They would just simply say, well, yeah, he's not evil, he's just tired of the politics.
[00:43:57.877 --> 00:43:59.458]  Well, David, that's a very important point.
[00:43:59.638 --> 00:44:05.361]  And I think we've got to make sure everybody understands how extremely left
[00:44:06.341 --> 00:44:11.447]  The Democratic Party has gone, and also the Soros-funded hard left.
[00:44:12.128 --> 00:44:15.271]  This is not the Democratic Party of Hubert Humphrey, Jack Kennedy.
[00:44:15.731 --> 00:44:20.196]  This is the Democratic Party of Che Guevara, Karl Marx, Saul Alinsky.
[00:44:20.917 --> 00:44:22.118]  And it's out for a revolution.
[00:44:22.719 --> 00:44:27.624]  Now, the revolution means that there's going to be ideas that you're going to be permitted to have.
[00:44:28.385 --> 00:44:37.953]  And there's going to be ideas that if you hold them, like Donald Trump ideas, make America great, the First Amendment, the Constitution, well now you're a criminal.
[00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:39.674]  You're a criminal of the state.
[00:44:40.215 --> 00:44:53.226]  And you have a right to be shot, imprisoned, tortured, whatever the left wants to do to you, because the left in its ideological purity feels justified in threatening or destroying anyone who objects to them.
[00:44:53.806 --> 00:44:59.988]  Now, it's not very far to see this as the leftist fascism, which it really truly is.
[00:45:00.068 --> 00:45:05.250]  Yeah, they call themselves anti-fascist, and yet they are exhibiting fascism themselves.
[00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:07.391]  Well, they're exhibiting... Authoritarianism, yeah.
[00:45:07.551 --> 00:45:20.015]  Intolerance, this political intolerance that the self-righteous... See, our Constitution, our Founding Fathers had the First Amendment because we wanted to believe that nobody had ideas that couldn't be challenged.
[00:45:20.595 --> 00:45:23.218]  To really get to the best ideas that had to be challenged.
[00:45:23.678 --> 00:45:36.550]  Now here, what the far left is doing is they're saying if President Trump tries to make America great again, tries to enforce immigration laws, well then, he deserves to be killed.
[00:45:37.452 --> 00:45:43.374]  Now, this is the kind of thing where you see a deterioration of politicalization of the Department of Justice.
[00:45:43.934 --> 00:45:46.895]  Because the Department of Justice then does not go after Hillary Clinton.
[00:45:47.255 --> 00:45:47.815]  Oh, that's alright.
[00:45:47.855 --> 00:45:54.157]  She can amass all kinds of powers and run a criminal charity because of course she's on the right side.
[00:45:54.217 --> 00:45:56.158]  She's going to do the right things with that money.
[00:45:56.818 --> 00:46:04.586]  Okay, and they will not prosecute Loretta Lynch for interfering in the FBI investigation.
[00:46:04.606 --> 00:46:07.449]  That's right, she's above reproach, above prosecution.
[00:46:07.469 --> 00:46:15.597]  But they'll take a completely vacuous, no evidence meme, like this Russian collusion, and knowing it has no evidence,
[00:46:16.238 --> 00:46:19.502]  They will now morph it so it's no longer just Russian collusion.
[00:46:19.562 --> 00:46:23.306]  Now it's the Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey.
[00:46:23.706 --> 00:46:26.990]  So they've morphed without admitting they lost the first argument.
[00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:27.410]  That's right.
[00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:33.276]  I want to go to something too because much has been made about the fact that this guy was a volunteer for the Bernie Sanders campaign.
[00:46:33.316 --> 00:46:35.499]  I'm not going to say that Bernie Sanders is at fault here.
[00:46:36.239 --> 00:46:36.940]  Well, we're out of time.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.761]  Dr. Corsi, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:46:38.821 --> 00:46:45.084]  And again, that shows us why we have picked Dr. Corsi as our Washington correspondent, his vast experience and knowledge.
[00:46:45.104 --> 00:46:45.925]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:46:46.485 --> 00:46:49.967]  I'm David Knight with Infowarriors.com and Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:46:49.987 --> 00:46:50.667]  Thank you so much.
[00:46:50.707 --> 00:46:51.868]  David, great pleasure to be with you.
[00:46:51.908 --> 00:46:52.588]  Thank you very much.
[00:46:52.608 --> 00:46:52.868]  Thank you.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.495]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:51.156]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.516 --> 00:48:59.063]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.083 --> 00:48:59.963]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:00.023]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:04.315 --> 00:49:06.817]  Let me state this clearly, colleagues.
[00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:20.148]  I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States.
[00:49:20.628 --> 00:49:26.713]  Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.
[00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:48.389]  I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, at least some of you, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion, that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for 35 years,
[00:49:51.976 --> 00:50:02.730]  Mr. Comey told us when he was here last week that he had a very specific recollection.
[00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:09.098]  In fact, he chased it down through the intelligence community and was not able to find a scintilla of evidence of that effect.
[00:50:09.398 --> 00:50:14.060]  Then he sought out both Republicans and Democrats up here to tell them that this was false.
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:20.823]  That there was no such facts anywhere that corroborated what the New York Times had reported.
[00:50:21.203 --> 00:50:32.728]  Nonetheless, after that, this... The failing New York Times leading the way in fake news... We spent really substantially more time on that than we have on the Russian active measures.
[00:50:33.008 --> 00:50:37.830]  We've been through thousands of pages of information, interviewed witnesses and everything else.
[00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:39.311]  Well, we're anywhere.
[00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:25.651]  Hit me with when I was testifying and it I think has been pretty substantially discredited But you would know more than I but it what was said this would suggest I participated in continuing Communications with Russians over as a surrogate is absolutely false You're a longtime colleague But we heard mr. Coates and we heard Admiral Rogers
[00:51:26.289 --> 00:51:32.015]  say essentially the same thing when it was easy just to say if the answer was no, no.
[00:51:33.516 --> 00:51:38.381]  Well, it would have been easy to say if it was yes, yes, but both would have been improper.
[00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:42.525]  Deputy Rosenstein's letter dealt with a number of things.
[00:51:42.865 --> 00:51:48.911]  When Mr. Comey declined the Clinton prosecution
[00:51:50.532 --> 00:51:58.414]  That was really a usurpation of the authority of the federal prosecutors in the Department of Justice.
[00:51:58.474 --> 00:52:00.214]  It was a stunning development.
[00:52:01.014 --> 00:52:01.754]  Bombshell.
[00:52:01.774 --> 00:52:02.475]  That's bombshell.
[00:52:02.495 --> 00:52:04.015]  The FBI is the investigative team.
[00:52:04.395 --> 00:52:07.475]  They don't decide prosecution policies.
[00:52:07.976 --> 00:52:10.796]  And so that was a thunderous thing.
[00:52:11.136 --> 00:52:14.717]  He also commented at some length on the declination
[00:52:15.377 --> 00:52:20.739]  The Clinton prosecution, which you should not normally, you shouldn't do.
[00:52:21.339 --> 00:52:31.102]  Mr. Comey, perhaps he didn't know, but I basically recused myself the day, the first day I got into the office because I never accessed files.
[00:52:31.162 --> 00:52:33.703]  I never learned the names of investigators.
[00:52:33.763 --> 00:52:35.203]  I never met with them.
[00:52:35.263 --> 00:52:37.464]  I never asked for any documentation.
[00:52:37.844 --> 00:52:44.906]  The documentation, what little I received, was mostly already in the media and was presented by the senior
[00:52:45.226 --> 00:52:47.849]  General Sessions, respectfully, you're not answering the question.
[00:52:47.869 --> 00:52:48.289]  The question is...
[00:53:09.147 --> 00:53:17.131]  Mr. Comey said that there were matters with respect to the recusal that were problematic and he couldn't talk about them.
[00:53:17.711 --> 00:53:18.512]  What are they?
[00:53:20.333 --> 00:53:21.533]  That, why don't you tell me?
[00:53:22.662 --> 00:53:24.584]  They are none, Senator Wyden.
[00:53:24.965 --> 00:53:25.865]  There are none.
[00:53:26.166 --> 00:53:30.190]  I can tell you that for absolute certainty.
[00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:39.420]  This is a secret innuendo being leaked out there about me, and I don't appreciate it, and I've tried to give my best and truthful answers.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.282]  So I want to ask you just point blank.
[00:53:42.382 --> 00:53:48.986]  Why did you sign the letter recommending the firing of Director Comey when it violated your recusal?
[00:53:49.146 --> 00:53:50.648]  It did not violate my recusal.
[00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:09.751]  It did not violate my recusal.
[00:54:10.911 --> 00:54:12.651]  That would be the answer to that.
[00:54:12.851 --> 00:54:19.653]  And the letter that I signed represented my views that had been formulated for some time.
[00:54:20.253 --> 00:54:25.615]  Mr. Chairman, just so I can finish, that answer, in my view, doesn't pass the smell test.
[00:54:26.215 --> 00:54:31.442]  The President tweeted repeatedly about his anger at investigations into his associates in Russia.
[00:54:31.862 --> 00:54:41.394]  The day before you wrote your letter, he tweeted that the collusion story was a total hoax and asked when will this taxpayer-funded charade end?
[00:54:41.415 --> 00:54:43.858]  I don't think your answer passes the smell test.
[00:54:44.226 --> 00:54:45.808]  There are two investigations here.
[00:54:45.888 --> 00:54:47.870]  There is a special counsel investigation.
[00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.973]  There is also a congressional investigation.
[00:54:51.374 --> 00:54:56.879]  And you are obstructing that congressional investigation by not answering these questions.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:04.908]  And I think your silence, like the silence of Director Coats, like the silence of Admiral Rogers, speaks volumes.
[00:55:05.982 --> 00:55:10.894]  I would say that I have consulted with senior career attorneys in the department.
[00:55:10.934 --> 00:55:11.295]  I suspect you have.
[00:55:11.315 --> 00:55:13.961]  And they believe this is consistent with my duties.
[00:55:16.428 --> 00:55:37.842]  Admiral Rogers spent almost two hours in closed session with almost the full committee fulfilling his commitment to us in the hearing that in closed session he would answer the question and I think it was thoroughly answered and all members were given an opportunity to ask questions.
[00:55:37.862 --> 00:55:41.284]  I just want the record to show that with what Senator Heinrichs has stated.
[00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:42.865]  I am on this side of the dais.
[00:55:43.766 --> 00:55:43.946]  Savage!
[00:56:05.405 --> 00:56:13.148]  Maybe that is because Jim Comey said last week, as he said to Donald Trump, that on three times he assured him he was not under investigation.
[00:56:13.569 --> 00:56:26.134]  Maybe it's because multiple Democrats on this committee have stated they have seen no evidence thus far, after six months of our investigation and 11 months of an FBI investigation, of any such collusion.
[00:56:27.254 --> 00:56:28.695]  Do you like spy fiction?
[00:56:28.995 --> 00:56:29.795]  John le Carre?
[00:56:30.316 --> 00:56:30.936]  Daniel Silva?
[00:56:31.156 --> 00:56:31.856]  Jason Matthews?
[00:56:32.296 --> 00:56:33.277]  Yeah, Alan first.
[00:56:34.184 --> 00:56:36.028]  Do you like Russian salad dressing?
[00:56:36.068 --> 00:56:39.494]  Do you like Jason Bourne or James Bond movies?
[00:56:40.195 --> 00:56:40.416]  No.
[00:56:41.037 --> 00:56:41.257]  Yes.
[00:56:44.293 --> 00:57:01.385]  Have you ever in any of these fantastical situations heard of a plot line so ridiculous that a sitting United States Senator and an ambassador of a foreign government colluded at an open setting with hundreds of other people to pull off the greatest caper in the history of Estonia?
[00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:05.168]  Thank you for saying that, Senator Cotton.
[00:57:05.608 --> 00:57:07.810]  It's just like through the looking glass.
[00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:10.010]  I mean, what is this?
[00:57:10.791 --> 00:57:20.722]  I explained how, in good faith, I said I had not met with Russians because they were suggesting I, as a surrogate, had been meeting continuously with Russians.
[00:57:20.782 --> 00:57:21.964]  I said I didn't meet with them.
[00:57:22.825 --> 00:57:29.052]  And now, the next thing you know, I'm accused of some reception plotting
[00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:33.615]  Some sort of influence campaign for the American election.
[00:57:33.975 --> 00:57:46.703]  It's just beyond my capability to understand and I really appreciate, Mr. Chairman, the opportunity at least to be able to say publicly I didn't participate in that and know nothing about it.
[00:57:46.723 --> 00:57:49.425]  Let's turn to the potential crimes that we know have happened.
[00:57:49.905 --> 00:57:51.026]  Leaks of certain information.
[00:57:51.366 --> 00:57:52.767]  Here's a short list of what I have.
[00:57:53.928 --> 00:57:58.831]  The contents of alleged transcripts of alleged conversations between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:21.243]  The contents of President Trump's phone calls with Australian and Mexican leaders, the content of Mr. Trump's meetings with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, the leak of the Manchester bombing suspect's identity and crime scene photos, and last week, within 20 minutes of this committee meeting in a classified setting with Jim Comey, the leak of what the basis of Mr. Comey's innuendo was.
[00:58:22.584 --> 00:58:33.773]  Are these leaks serious threats to our national security and is the Department of Justice taking them with the appropriate degree of seriousness and investigating and ultimately going to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law?
[00:58:34.073 --> 00:58:35.374]  Thank you, Senator Cotton.
[00:58:36.175 --> 00:58:40.078]  We have had one successful case very recently in Georgia.
[00:58:40.098 --> 00:58:44.641]  That person has been denied bail, I believe, and is being held in custody.
[00:58:44.681 --> 00:58:45.722]  That's reality winner.
[00:58:45.782 --> 00:58:48.283]  Thanks for joining us tonight.
[00:58:48.303 --> 00:58:50.945]  Remember to join us again tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[00:58:50.985 --> 00:58:51.245]  Central.
