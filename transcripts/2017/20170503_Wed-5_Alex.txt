[00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.491]  We're good to go.
[00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:16.957]  A modern Paul Revere who could warn people about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:22.782]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:32.970]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.855]  Wednesday, May 3rd and Thursday, May 4th, we're doing a 30-hour transmission that kicked off at 11 a.m.
[00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:41.755]  on Wednesday.
[00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:47.479]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.603]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[00:00:54.221 --> 00:01:05.669]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show, or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news, but have not actually heard the message.
[00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.651]  Tell people, this is the forbidden message.
[00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:10.633]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:13.094]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:18.478]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host character.
[00:01:18.738 --> 00:01:23.622]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society, goodwill.
[00:01:24.554 --> 00:01:26.935]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:31.077]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:31.677]  That's the goal.
[00:01:31.797 --> 00:01:33.919]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.219]  No.
[00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:40.222]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:44.684]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:45.638]  Yes.
[00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:03.336]  And also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[00:02:03.677 --> 00:02:14.062]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[00:02:14.562 --> 00:02:29.149]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high-quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.270]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:40.032]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private-labeled at lower prices.
[00:02:40.052 --> 00:02:41.713]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:48.235]  And many of which I've developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers like Knockout, our amazing sleep aid.
[00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:58.818]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:01.879]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.341]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:12.243]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:18.326]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:20.567]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:21.427]  They see the lies.
[00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:22.848]  They see the demonization.
[00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:27.670]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic than InfoWars.com.
[00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:37.913]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:49.257]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:54.859]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:56.278]  I think?
[00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.326]  We have Secret 12 at 20% off.
[00:04:18.686 --> 00:04:21.528]  We have Living Defense, a parasite cleanse, 20% off.
[00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.710]  Biome Defense, our great probiotic, 25% off.
[00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:28.053]  Bio PCA for skin and nails, top formula.
[00:04:28.353 --> 00:04:32.035]  Other formulas that are similar cost 60, 70 bucks, two, three times what ours does.
[00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.177]  Prostagard, incredible formula.
[00:04:34.657 --> 00:04:38.659]  Winter Sun, the knockout that I mentioned, and so many other great products.
[00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:39.340]  And then finally,
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.260]  Let me see if it's still here.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.660]  It is.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.541]  This just came back in after two months being sold out.
[00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:47.222]  Super blue, high quality, organic toothpaste.
[00:04:47.943 --> 00:04:52.964]  Fluoride-free, with iodine, with colloidal silver, with tea tree oil and peppermint oil.
[00:04:53.304 --> 00:04:54.184]  It's concentrated.
[00:04:54.264 --> 00:04:57.085]  My dad is a quasi-retired dentist, oral surgeon.
[00:04:57.325 --> 00:05:00.506]  He helped develop this with one of the biggest manufacturers in the country.
[00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:01.326]  It's amazing.
[00:05:01.707 --> 00:05:05.348]  And again, when you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off.
[00:05:05.448 --> 00:05:05.988]  It's a win-win.
[00:05:06.528 --> 00:05:10.411]  You remember to support us each month or every two months or every three months, however you sign up.
[00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:21.760]  You can cancel anytime and you can get 10% off and then don't have to remember to keep supporting us and also get the products that obviously run out that you've got to replenish.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.541]  These are great renewable resources.
[00:05:23.862 --> 00:05:24.962]  Please continue to support us.
[00:05:25.063 --> 00:05:27.544]  Again, I want to defeat the globalist.
[00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:28.265]  I'm determined.
[00:05:28.345 --> 00:05:28.886]  I'm focused.
[00:05:29.426 --> 00:05:34.350]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us and without you praying for us,
[00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:37.297]  We don't have a chance in hell.
[00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.506]  But if you get behind us like you've already done...
[00:05:41.155 --> 00:05:42.076]  Turn it up a notch?
[00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:46.279]  We are unstoppable, ladies and gentlemen, because humans want freedom.
[00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:48.901]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:50.342]  We want to go to the stars.
[00:05:50.743 --> 00:05:51.984]  Look how far we've already come.
[00:05:52.224 --> 00:05:53.965]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:57.268]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[00:05:57.548 --> 00:06:00.551]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:05.054]  Let's tell Ted Turner, who could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:06.596]  And let's take action.
[00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:15.233]  There's nowhere you can spend your hard-earned money to get better products and then make sure that money goes to a good cause than InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:16.797]  But regardless of what you do...
[00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:28.302]  Spread the links, spread the articles, and let people know about this 30-hour special broadcast so new people tune in and learn about the nightly news, the daily show I do, and the news sites and everything we're engaged in.
[00:06:28.342 --> 00:06:33.726]  Because we're not perfect, but our hearts are in the right place and we are pulling as hard as we can for victory.
[00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:42.553]  Now back to the live transmission with the amazing host and guest and special reports during the 30-hour broadcast that we're now partway into.
[00:06:42.913 --> 00:06:45.375]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:46.916]  Please spread that link.
[00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.472]  All right, and we are live here back at 7 a.m., 7 o' 8 now.
[00:07:09.392 --> 00:07:12.154]  Officially, if you're keeping score.
[00:07:12.174 --> 00:07:14.956]  How many hours does that make us, Zimmerman?
[00:07:16.037 --> 00:07:16.677]  Figure that out.
[00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:19.059]  Hey, this is Rob Dew, Michael Zerman here for your morning.
[00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:20.900]  Waking everybody up.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.881]  I just want to tell you a little bit about our sponsors.
[00:07:23.802 --> 00:07:25.143]  First one's Wake Up America Coffee.
[00:07:26.598 --> 00:07:26.938]  That's right.
[00:07:26.978 --> 00:07:28.499]  In fact, I'm drinking some right now.
[00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:30.160]  Zerman's got a cup as well.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.542]  And I think we have a deal where you get a little InfoWars mug at the same time.
[00:07:35.582 --> 00:07:39.004]  Just one of the ways you can support us by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:07:39.044 --> 00:07:41.605]  And also, I'm going to do this live on air.
[00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:42.545]  20 hours in.
[00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:43.826]  20 hours in.
[00:07:43.886 --> 00:07:44.246]  Thank you.
[00:07:44.446 --> 00:07:45.087]  We need some of this.
[00:07:45.287 --> 00:07:46.287]  Took me a while.
[00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:51.538]  Me and Zerman left here about, what, 1?
[00:07:52.518 --> 00:07:53.659]  Here's your 2 brain force.
[00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:54.699]  Oh no, it was... 1.30?
[00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:55.480]  It was closer to 3.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.980]  Yeah.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.202]  Well, because we came on with Owen and we were saying, we're going to be right back here in 4 hours.
[00:08:02.342 --> 00:08:08.985]  We got a little bit of sleep in, a little bit of prep in, and then woke up and got down here to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:10.986]  So, we're taking our brain force now.
[00:08:15.777 --> 00:08:17.118]  And we're going to see 709 in 11 seconds.
[00:08:17.158 --> 00:08:21.261]  We're going to see how long it takes for that little switch to get flipped.
[00:08:22.222 --> 00:08:22.662]  That's right.
[00:08:22.982 --> 00:08:28.867]  Also, we're going to be taking your phone calls throughout the morning, and we have a guest on next hour.
[00:08:28.887 --> 00:08:32.129]  That's Lionel from Lionel Media up in New York.
[00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.091]  Sure have some great rants, and he'll be waking you up this morning.
[00:08:36.012 --> 00:08:37.153]  Let's give out that call in number 877-789-2539.
[00:08:37.173 --> 00:08:37.213]  877-789-2539.
[00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:37.633]  Now last night,
[00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:47.965]  There was a big whoop-de-doo at Buckingham Palace.
[00:08:48.545 --> 00:08:48.985]  There was.
[00:08:49.206 --> 00:08:50.526]  All the media was buzzing about it.
[00:08:50.886 --> 00:08:52.327]  All the press had gathered there.
[00:08:52.347 --> 00:08:53.807]  What's going on?
[00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:54.828]  What's going on?
[00:08:54.848 --> 00:08:56.008]  Did one of the royals die?
[00:08:56.028 --> 00:08:56.589]  Rubab, Rubab.
[00:08:56.609 --> 00:09:01.151]  Okay, and I was reading up a little bit about it very late last night as I was trying to fall asleep.
[00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:04.552]  And they were saying that they have a procedure in the UK.
[00:09:04.732 --> 00:09:07.073]  When someone in the royal family dies, they do wait till
[00:09:07.393 --> 00:09:07.773]  We're good to go.
[00:09:29.574 --> 00:09:30.795]  Duties of being a figurehead.
[00:09:30.835 --> 00:09:31.855]  The Duke of Edinburgh.
[00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:32.316]  Yes.
[00:09:32.436 --> 00:09:34.917]  He will not be following the Queen around.
[00:09:34.937 --> 00:09:40.461]  And on the Daily Mail article, they had a little square shot of the Queen and she looked like she was 65.
[00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:43.042]  I'm like, she does not look that old.
[00:09:43.102 --> 00:09:44.123]  That's crazy.
[00:09:44.223 --> 00:09:44.343]  She's 91?
[00:09:44.603 --> 00:09:46.144]  Yeah.
[00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:48.726]  She's getting up there and she looks great.
[00:09:48.786 --> 00:09:51.948]  Maybe it's those blood transfusions she's doing with the baby's blood.
[00:09:51.968 --> 00:09:54.289]  People need to look that up.
[00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.810]  Look that up and wake up.
[00:09:58.058 --> 00:09:59.699]  So we're going to have some callers popping in.
[00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:09.064]  The big news yesterday was Comey, but not talking about what actually happened in his investigation with Hillary Clinton, but how he felt about it.
[00:10:09.144 --> 00:10:12.206]  Having to make decisions between right and wrong.
[00:10:12.806 --> 00:10:14.067]  He felt nauseous, yeah.
[00:10:14.507 --> 00:10:17.469]  Nauseous to think FBI impacted presidential election.
[00:10:17.489 --> 00:10:18.349]  That was from the Hill.
[00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.790]  Poor James Comey.
[00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:21.851]  I'm sorry you had to do your job.
[00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:22.511]  Oh man.
[00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:23.392]  That's unfortunate.
[00:10:24.608 --> 00:10:26.089]  I mean, he felt so bad.
[00:10:26.109 --> 00:10:32.952]  And it wasn't the fact that 6,000 classified emails were passed to a disgraced representative.
[00:10:33.393 --> 00:10:34.473]  No, that's not the point.
[00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:37.155]  Or 30,000 got deleted in the first place.
[00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:39.456]  Three months of her emails were missing.
[00:10:39.516 --> 00:10:40.356]  That's not the point.
[00:10:40.577 --> 00:10:41.717]  It was all about yoga, don't worry.
[00:10:42.117 --> 00:10:44.539]  I felt bad about making a decision.
[00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:47.380]  Hey, it was wedding planning and yoga.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.141]  I think I have to go to the bathroom.
[00:10:49.161 --> 00:10:50.682]  I have at least that many emails on the topic.
[00:10:52.188 --> 00:10:53.990]  Totally ridiculous.
[00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.452]  Hey, let's go to Sean in Illinois.
[00:10:56.492 --> 00:10:57.052]  Hey, Sean.
[00:10:57.413 --> 00:10:58.473]  Thanks for waking up with us.
[00:10:58.493 --> 00:10:59.935]  How are you doing this morning?
[00:11:00.095 --> 00:11:00.695]  Hey, Rob.
[00:11:01.856 --> 00:11:03.658]  I always get up early in the morning.
[00:11:04.058 --> 00:11:06.060]  Gotta get up, gotta get to work, you know?
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.261]  It's good for you, actually.
[00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:07.821]  It is?
[00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:12.125]  I don't do it enough, but more of a late-night person, as we were last night.
[00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:12.606]  But, yeah.
[00:11:13.787 --> 00:11:14.307]  What's on your mind?
[00:11:16.349 --> 00:11:17.650]  I just wanted to call in.
[00:11:18.297 --> 00:11:19.957]  And I'm so glad it's the morning.
[00:11:20.037 --> 00:11:22.158]  Good morning everyone who's listening.
[00:11:22.218 --> 00:11:23.138]  Good morning!
[00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:34.341]  Everyone needs to realize, especially the Trump voters, now is the time that we need to be motivated.
[00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:35.941]  We need to be active.
[00:11:36.041 --> 00:11:37.322]  We need to be moving.
[00:11:37.342 --> 00:11:40.002]  I agree.
[00:11:40.522 --> 00:11:42.443]  I think you can't sit down at this point and
[00:11:44.135 --> 00:11:51.158]  And whatever your policy is, but we have to engage, especially the people that are out there just running around with chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:11:52.238 --> 00:11:53.719]  Trump is this, Trump is that.
[00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:56.059]  Anybody that disagrees with me is a fascist.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.660]  Oh my goodness, Rob.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.961]  I live outside of Chicago, you have no idea.
[00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:02.402]  That's unfortunate.
[00:12:02.502 --> 00:12:03.002]  I'm sorry.
[00:12:04.062 --> 00:12:05.423]  Do you work in the Windy City?
[00:12:05.503 --> 00:12:06.363]  I mean, I'm alive.
[00:12:07.484 --> 00:12:08.924]  That's all that matters, you know?
[00:12:09.164 --> 00:12:09.624]  Exactly.
[00:12:09.664 --> 00:12:11.205]  So are you waking people up in your area?
[00:12:13.286 --> 00:12:15.467]  Um, I hope someone hears it.
[00:12:16.288 --> 00:12:19.109]  Uh, Eric, Mike, you guys hear me?
[00:12:19.769 --> 00:12:20.890]  You guys gotta wake up.
[00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.270]  You guys gotta get active.
[00:12:24.832 --> 00:12:25.352]  All right.
[00:12:26.052 --> 00:12:26.492]  Well, thanks.
[00:12:26.672 --> 00:12:27.813]  Thanks for calling, Sean.
[00:12:28.033 --> 00:12:28.733]  Uh, we appreciate it.
[00:12:28.753 --> 00:12:30.094]  How are you listening to us right now?
[00:12:31.315 --> 00:12:41.279]  Um, I'm listening to you on my phone and you gave out the number, so I just called in and I just wanted to get that message out.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.340]  It's time that
[00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:44.007]  We got active.
[00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:46.848]  I was at the Nashville Trump rally.
[00:12:47.428 --> 00:12:51.691]  I was not afraid to engage the anti-Trump people.
[00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:53.752]  They had nothing.
[00:12:54.272 --> 00:12:55.793]  There was like 30 of them.
[00:12:56.333 --> 00:13:00.595]  And then the next morning, they're like, oh, thousands showed up.
[00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:07.079]  And I was like, no, like 30 people showed up to protest them.
[00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:09.961]  And it's just, they live in this world.
[00:13:11.001 --> 00:13:12.502]  And it's actually kind of scary.
[00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:23.909]  Well I remember going to a Trump rally in Wausau back when he was going up against, it was really tight with him and Ted Cruz in the primary, the Republican primary.
[00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:25.471]  Drove all the way up to Wausau.
[00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:36.897]  From like the Milwaukee area and there were thousands of people in fact there were so many people at this rally that they had to let them out in the hallways and they were listening to it through the loudspeakers.
[00:13:36.957 --> 00:13:45.181]  This was like kind of a mall type thing which I guess up north everything's kind of covered so that the walkways were covered and everything and it was huge.
[00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:51.765]  Here's the thing over on an island you know somewhere in the middle of this giant parking lot this is a huge facility.
[00:13:53.368 --> 00:13:55.631]  There was three or four protesters with signs.
[00:13:56.172 --> 00:13:58.575]  And you know what you saw on the next day in the paper?
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.022]  Protesters at Trump's Wausau Rally.
[00:14:02.062 --> 00:14:06.364]  Well, they do the same thing that they do at the rallies to try to make it look like there aren't many supporters.
[00:14:06.724 --> 00:14:08.666]  They'll show, like, the empty seats at the very top.
[00:14:08.706 --> 00:14:09.226]  Look up there!
[00:14:09.246 --> 00:14:10.427]  There's an empty seat up there!
[00:14:10.447 --> 00:14:11.127]  Or the Hillary thing.
[00:14:11.147 --> 00:14:14.969]  They would position the cameras in such a way so that it looks like there's a packed room.
[00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.371]  The media is super deceptive about that, and they'll do the same thing with the protests.
[00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:19.872]  There'll be five people, ten people.
[00:14:20.173 --> 00:14:24.055]  They'll use these low-angle shots and make it look like there's a massive crowd there protesting.
[00:14:24.795 --> 00:14:25.516]  Super dishonest.
[00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:27.721]  Hey, but that's why we're here.
[00:14:27.841 --> 00:14:29.622]  We're here to pick that apart.
[00:14:29.642 --> 00:14:33.543]  We went to so many of those Trump rallies to just expose these protesters.
[00:14:33.923 --> 00:14:35.903]  And eventually they kind of stopped showing up.
[00:14:36.684 --> 00:14:43.745]  They did, and now it's morphed into this Antifa movement, which is kind of amorphous and just goes after, you know, women, old people.
[00:14:44.065 --> 00:14:45.546]  They'll show up, but they won't show their faces.
[00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:46.746]  They won't put their name to it.
[00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:51.027]  Hey, we in America, we know how to deal with commies.
[00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:53.307]  Punch a commie for mommy.
[00:14:54.488 --> 00:14:55.428]  That's being nice.
[00:14:57.706 --> 00:15:06.989]  You know, I would say at this rally we went to on Monday, the May Day Commie Rally, I would say 70% of those kids are just looking for a friend.
[00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.371]  And, you know, the commie happened to be right there.
[00:15:10.391 --> 00:15:13.312]  Hey man, I can offer friendship in a revolution!
[00:15:13.332 --> 00:15:14.232]  I'll be your commie, man.
[00:15:14.632 --> 00:15:15.373]  Oh yeah, cool.
[00:15:16.713 --> 00:15:17.994]  You know, you look at what happened in Portland.
[00:15:18.074 --> 00:15:21.236]  Maybe you guys could pull up some images of what happened in the Portland Mayday.
[00:15:21.256 --> 00:15:22.537]  They were, you know, lighting fires.
[00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:25.238]  They were shooting, cops were shooting tear gas in full battle gear.
[00:15:25.699 --> 00:15:28.300]  We had bike cops, you know, kind of riding with us.
[00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:33.043]  It wasn't nearly, but these guys weren't that scary, even though some of them were carrying guns.
[00:15:33.384 --> 00:15:33.864]  But you know what?
[00:15:34.464 --> 00:15:36.906]  There were people on the opposite side carrying guns and the police were carrying guns.
[00:15:36.946 --> 00:15:39.207]  Everybody was carrying guns and nobody got out of hand.
[00:15:39.227 --> 00:15:42.649]  There was a few little scuffles, but that's, we're showing up on screen.
[00:15:42.669 --> 00:15:44.851]  This is what happened in Portland.
[00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:47.978]  I think the worst they did in Austin was they lit a flare.
[00:15:48.638 --> 00:15:50.339]  Yeah, a couple flares got lit.
[00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:54.281]  There's a great video that happened at this event, I believe.
[00:15:54.341 --> 00:16:03.204]  I don't know if these are May Day ones or not, but in that same spot in Portland, there's a great video of all these riot cops just running in and grabbing these guys.
[00:16:04.145 --> 00:16:06.926]  Like doing the whole kettling thing that we've seen at a lot of these events.
[00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:08.427]  That was a few months back.
[00:16:09.537 --> 00:16:10.077]  They do that.
[00:16:10.297 --> 00:16:11.658]  It was right where these train tracks are.
[00:16:11.758 --> 00:16:12.358]  Same spot.
[00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:15.880]  So the police in Portland know how to deal with these armed thugs.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.741]  They're not going after the photographer.
[00:16:17.761 --> 00:16:19.362]  People are saying it's a worn-on press.
[00:16:19.522 --> 00:16:20.442]  They're leaving the press alone.
[00:16:20.482 --> 00:16:30.667]  Well, and then they refer to how Tim Poole was detained at the inauguration, but they grabbed everyone who was in that area, but they let him and other journalists go and only rounded up the antifa in the end.
[00:16:31.894 --> 00:16:33.835]  I got rammed it up in a kettling operation once.
[00:16:34.315 --> 00:16:34.655]  You did?
[00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:35.315]  I did.
[00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:36.776]  Thanks for calling, Sean.
[00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:38.497]  Let's go to Tanya in Wisconsin.
[00:16:38.817 --> 00:16:39.917]  Tanya, how you doing this morning?
[00:16:39.937 --> 00:16:41.558]  Hi, Rob Dukes.
[00:16:41.698 --> 00:16:42.398]  I'm doing great.
[00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:42.918]  How are you?
[00:16:43.238 --> 00:16:43.979]  I'm doing great.
[00:16:44.019 --> 00:16:48.700]  I'm very happy to be alive and happy to be with you guys this morning at 7 a.m., 20 hours into our 30-hour-plus marathon.
[00:16:50.674 --> 00:16:50.914]  Go ahead.
[00:16:51.014 --> 00:16:52.355]  Oh my God, this is so exciting!
[00:16:52.715 --> 00:16:53.976]  I can't believe I'm talking to you guys.
[00:16:53.996 --> 00:16:56.277]  I've been a fan of you guys for many years.
[00:16:56.817 --> 00:17:04.921]  I've been following you for many years, watching your YouTube, Twitter, sharing your links all over the place, all over the internet.
[00:17:05.401 --> 00:17:06.722]  I've been supporting you guys.
[00:17:07.563 --> 00:17:20.389]  And when you guys came out with the BrainForce Plus pills, I mean, I ordered it because prior to this, like over 20 years ago, I suffered a brain injury, TBI, and I have headaches.
[00:17:21.554 --> 00:17:23.155]  What did you say, TBI?
[00:17:23.355 --> 00:17:25.336]  Yeah, traumatic brain injury.
[00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:26.157]  Traumatic brain injury.
[00:17:26.217 --> 00:17:26.857]  Okay, geez.
[00:17:26.877 --> 00:17:27.077]  Yeah.
[00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:30.519]  So, from that, I've been taking those pills.
[00:17:30.899 --> 00:17:31.960]  It's been helping my headaches.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.561]  I have no more headaches from this.
[00:17:34.081 --> 00:17:36.102]  I've been feeling more energized.
[00:17:36.803 --> 00:17:38.324]  I've been losing weight too.
[00:17:38.484 --> 00:17:39.484]  It really helps.
[00:17:40.265 --> 00:17:41.566]  Well, let's read out what's in...
[00:17:42.816 --> 00:17:43.616]  Rainforest Plus.
[00:17:43.756 --> 00:17:55.661]  It's a couple of B vitamins, alpha lipoic acid, bacoa herb, yerba mate, L-thionine, and hupperzine A, black pepper fruit extract.
[00:17:56.202 --> 00:18:00.103]  You can check out all the ingredients online at InfoWorthStore.com.
[00:18:00.363 --> 00:18:01.484]  We just took our Rainforest.
[00:18:01.524 --> 00:18:03.405]  I'm already starting to feel the level.
[00:18:03.865 --> 00:18:04.225]  I'm feeling it.
[00:18:04.685 --> 00:18:07.646]  Well, we got, like you said, an hour, hour and a half of sleep last night.
[00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:08.787]  That's right, and we're feeling good.
[00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:11.048]  But we're also having our Wake Up America coffee.
[00:18:11.368 --> 00:18:12.189]  That sounds excellent.
[00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.210]  Tanya, how are you listening to us this morning?
[00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.352]  I'm on my laptop, my Dell laptop.
[00:18:17.893 --> 00:18:22.516]  And also, I wanted to say, I've been to three or four different Trump rallies.
[00:18:22.856 --> 00:18:28.020]  When Trump was running for president, I've been to Milwaukee, Waukesha, Gainesville, and Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.450]  Wow.
[00:18:30.311 --> 00:18:32.551]  And did you go to a Hillary Clinton rally at all?
[00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:33.552]  Do you have a comparison?
[00:18:34.172 --> 00:18:34.632]  You know what?
[00:18:34.652 --> 00:18:38.554]  Me and my friend did decide to go to a Hillary Clinton rally in Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:18:38.814 --> 00:18:39.274]  We went there.
[00:18:39.294 --> 00:18:40.095]  There was only 85 people there.
[00:18:40.115 --> 00:18:41.295]  There were all racist people.
[00:18:41.335 --> 00:18:42.015]  I believe it.
[00:18:42.676 --> 00:18:48.558]  We went to Trump's victory rally that he had in Des Moines, and the number of people there was just incredible.
[00:18:48.698 --> 00:18:52.480]  It was freezing outside, which they're probably more used to it than we are.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.902]  But people were lining up outside this building, and it's, you know, 7, 8 degrees out there.
[00:18:59.076 --> 00:19:00.237]  Tanya, let me ask you something.
[00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:04.462]  What is your feeling about the first 100 days of the Trump presidency?
[00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:06.925]  A plus.
[00:19:07.566 --> 00:19:07.886]  A plus.
[00:19:09.908 --> 00:19:10.229]  A plus.
[00:19:10.289 --> 00:19:11.030]  That's all I gotta say.
[00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:11.670]  A plus.
[00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:12.671]  He's doing his work.
[00:19:12.692 --> 00:19:13.352]  He's doing his job.
[00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:16.916]  I've been an avid Trump supporter since 1989, since I was 9 years old.
[00:19:17.177 --> 00:19:17.357]  Wow.
[00:19:18.752 --> 00:19:33.600]  And also, I want to mention, when Chelsea Clinton, during the rallies, went to Green Bay, Wisconsin, me and my friend drove up there, just to get five minutes of Chelsea Clinton's time, and we asked her, how does it feel that your dad is a pedophile?
[00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:37.482]  And how do you feel that your dad raped these girls?
[00:19:37.723 --> 00:19:38.843]  Did you get this on video?
[00:19:39.183 --> 00:19:40.024]  We were escorted out.
[00:19:40.684 --> 00:19:41.605]  Did you get this on video?
[00:19:42.685 --> 00:19:45.486]  No, unfortunately we weren't allowed to bring our cameras in.
[00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:47.407]  Ah, well that's why you bring a phone in.
[00:19:47.427 --> 00:19:48.907]  They never block you from having the cell phone.
[00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:49.447]  That's right.
[00:19:49.467 --> 00:19:49.987]  That's the trick.
[00:19:50.027 --> 00:19:53.068]  So many places that won't let you film, you can always film with your phone.
[00:19:53.108 --> 00:20:06.052]  Hey, and you know, I don't know what, well, I don't know what the, you gotta see what the wire tapping laws are called, or recording laws, because sometimes in Texas, I could be recording and not have to tell the other person as long as one person knows.
[00:20:06.092 --> 00:20:08.873]  Right, but you're not allowed to eavesdrop on two people speaking.
[00:20:08.933 --> 00:20:10.134]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:20:10.154 --> 00:20:11.114]  But if you're having a conversation.
[00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:12.775]  It's not the same.
[00:20:12.815 --> 00:20:14.596]  You can't use hidden cameras or anything like that.
[00:20:14.616 --> 00:20:17.537]  So there's only certain states where you're even able to do that.
[00:20:17.557 --> 00:20:20.519]  I guess unless you're filming Punk'd or something like that.
[00:20:20.539 --> 00:20:23.920]  Those shows, they probably get some kind of pass because they're entertainment shows.
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.221]  I already feel the brain force working.
[00:20:25.301 --> 00:20:25.701]  Definitely.
[00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:27.302]  My brain is moving faster.
[00:20:27.862 --> 00:20:28.963]  Tanya, do you have anything else?
[00:20:30.109 --> 00:20:31.870]  No, but thank you for your show, man.
[00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:32.811]  Just keep up the good work.
[00:20:32.951 --> 00:20:35.153]  You guys are fighting for the freedom of speech.
[00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:35.693]  Keep doing it.
[00:20:35.913 --> 00:20:36.994]  Alright, thank you.
[00:20:37.515 --> 00:20:41.317]  And thank you for getting BrainForce Plus and for that excellent testimonial.
[00:20:41.678 --> 00:20:42.858]  Hope everything goes well for you.
[00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:45.400]  Let's go to Phil in Pennsylvania.
[00:20:46.401 --> 00:20:47.182]  Phil, how are you doing?
[00:20:47.202 --> 00:20:49.884]  Hey, good.
[00:20:50.704 --> 00:20:52.125]  Now, what part of Pennsylvania are you in?
[00:20:52.145 --> 00:20:52.966]  That's a big state.
[00:20:54.567 --> 00:20:55.368]  Lancaster County.
[00:20:56.308 --> 00:20:56.589]  Okay.
[00:20:57.769 --> 00:20:57.929]  Yes.
[00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.751]  I was wondering about why
[00:21:00.786 --> 00:21:02.407]  I don't know.
[00:21:22.757 --> 00:21:23.898]  Yeah.
[00:21:24.018 --> 00:21:26.099]  No, that's definitely a good way of looking at it.
[00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:29.221]  And he's already backed off of calling them a currency manipulator now.
[00:21:30.342 --> 00:21:35.284]  In his rally the other day, he's like, no, I don't think it's time to call them that because they're agreeing to work with us on North Korea.
[00:21:35.324 --> 00:21:36.125]  Isn't that a good thing?
[00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:45.370]  And it is, you know, they are saying they want to work with us, but they definitely could be using their influence there as leverage against the president for sure.
[00:21:46.051 --> 00:21:46.211]  Yeah.
[00:21:46.977 --> 00:21:53.805]  Well, you know, back on April 11th, China did make the move rejecting North Korean coal supply shipments.
[00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:54.746]  They opt for U.S.
[00:21:54.766 --> 00:21:55.907]  supplies instead.
[00:21:57.349 --> 00:21:59.151]  And then on The Sun, we have an article up.
[00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:00.312]  Go back to that, guys.
[00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:01.253]  I'll read that headline.
[00:22:02.274 --> 00:22:08.321]  North Korea threatens nuclear war with main ally China and warns of grave consequences for cozying up to the U.S.
[00:22:09.557 --> 00:22:11.320]  I mean, crazy.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:19.032]  So we know North Korea is a puppet of China and they get most of their technology from China and they're, you know, kind of like
[00:22:20.516 --> 00:22:22.857]  They did stop these coal shipments from coming in.
[00:22:22.897 --> 00:22:23.897]  They were taking our coal, which is good.
[00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:25.278]  That's sort of a plus in our book.
[00:22:45.566 --> 00:22:52.449]  You know, I think a lot of what Trump does is when he goes out there to make a deal, he goes, you know, you're a total idiot, I'm not going to work with you.
[00:22:52.469 --> 00:22:54.190]  And I go, please, we'll do anything.
[00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:54.450]  We'll do.
[00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.470]  Oh, you'll do anything?
[00:22:55.711 --> 00:22:56.791]  All right, let's sit down to the table.
[00:22:56.811 --> 00:22:57.531]  We'll negotiate.
[00:22:58.012 --> 00:23:01.173]  And you can kind of see that style happening in a lot of ways.
[00:23:01.693 --> 00:23:03.854]  He throws out a bombastic saying.
[00:23:03.874 --> 00:23:05.195]  People go, oh, no, we can't do that.
[00:23:05.235 --> 00:23:06.455]  He's like, all right, well, I'll take this.
[00:23:06.495 --> 00:23:07.756]  And they're like, oh, well, that seems reasonable.
[00:23:07.776 --> 00:23:11.037]  He lays it out all out in Art of the Deal, exactly what he does.
[00:23:11.097 --> 00:23:11.918]  It's his big ask.
[00:23:12.478 --> 00:23:16.340]  You know, you ask for something big and unreasonable, and then you walk them back down on it.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.240]  It's not reasonable!
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.481]  It's reasonable!
[00:23:18.801 --> 00:23:22.963]  You still get something much closer to what you want than what they're initially offering.
[00:23:23.724 --> 00:23:25.024]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:26.605]  So, Phil, you got another question?
[00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:28.506]  Yeah, I've got one.
[00:23:29.487 --> 00:23:29.827]  That's it?
[00:23:30.327 --> 00:23:33.409]  Alright, buddy, how are you listening to us today, this morning, this beautiful morning?
[00:23:33.689 --> 00:23:35.069]  Oh, on the phone.
[00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:36.110]  Awesome.
[00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.291]  So you got the app, the InfoWars Live app?
[00:23:39.272 --> 00:23:40.332]  Yep, that's right.
[00:23:40.472 --> 00:23:41.473]  A lot of people using the app.
[00:23:41.533 --> 00:23:41.993]  That's good to hear.
[00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:45.462]  I watched the show a couple times this morning on the app.
[00:23:45.963 --> 00:23:48.644]  I'm checking it in different platforms, making sure everything's going smoothly.
[00:23:49.184 --> 00:23:53.286]  But it is good to be able to look at it on your phone or look at it on your computer.
[00:23:53.446 --> 00:23:55.087]  At any time, we have a lot of different ways to do it.
[00:23:55.387 --> 00:23:57.888]  One of those is InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:23:58.248 --> 00:24:01.909]  The other way is to go get the InfoWars Live app for Android.
[00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.431]  You can get it for Android or for your iPhone.
[00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:05.651]  Go to the iTunes store.
[00:24:05.671 --> 00:24:06.511]  Thanks for calling, Phil.
[00:24:07.232 --> 00:24:09.293]  And let's go to Emmanuel in Kentucky.
[00:24:10.353 --> 00:24:15.396]  Let's talk about Sam Girard, an FDA arrestee.
[00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:16.997]  Oh, so this guy got arrested by the FDA?
[00:24:17.017 --> 00:24:17.617]  What was he doing?
[00:24:18.658 --> 00:24:21.980]  Yeah, he's been making chickweed salve for about 20 years.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.200]  Chickweed?
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.001]  Chickweed what?
[00:24:24.681 --> 00:24:25.061]  Salve.
[00:24:25.462 --> 00:24:25.922]  What is that?
[00:24:26.622 --> 00:24:27.443]  He was making a salve.
[00:24:27.483 --> 00:24:28.283]  Alternative medicine salve.
[00:24:28.503 --> 00:24:30.484]  Oh, okay, so something you put on a cut or something?
[00:24:30.685 --> 00:24:31.325]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:31.465 --> 00:24:31.785]  Okay.
[00:24:32.145 --> 00:24:33.606]  And they got him for that?
[00:24:33.626 --> 00:24:35.968]  They've been going after him for about 12 years.
[00:24:36.028 --> 00:24:37.468]  I think I've heard about this guy.
[00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:38.509]  The chickweed man.
[00:24:38.529 --> 00:24:39.690]  I was just wondering if
[00:24:40.868 --> 00:24:42.809]  You know, he's an Amish guy.
[00:24:43.229 --> 00:24:43.669]  Of course.
[00:24:44.169 --> 00:24:48.570]  I'm Amish as well, so I don't have internet, but I've never heard you guys talk about this situation.
[00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.611]  You're the first person that I've ever heard.
[00:24:50.691 --> 00:24:52.611]  I'm looking it up right now and we're going to talk about it.
[00:24:53.252 --> 00:25:01.834]  But, yes, he was, in 2003, they first came after him because he had on the label, he had something about it might be effective for skin cancer.
[00:25:01.854 --> 00:25:03.875]  I can't say that, buddy.
[00:25:03.895 --> 00:25:04.675]  Wrong idea.
[00:25:05.215 --> 00:25:06.676]  You can't use the C word.
[00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:10.470]  But then he took that off the label.
[00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.632]  He's made, over the years, he's made three changes to his labeling.
[00:25:14.793 --> 00:25:16.134]  And now... And that's usually what they look for.
[00:25:16.154 --> 00:25:23.058]  The FDA is like, okay, if you're going to work with us, you know, you didn't know, they'll usually let it, you know, let a grievance slide.
[00:25:23.857 --> 00:25:28.699]  So Sam Gerard is a Kentucky farmer who runs a small business selling natural skin salve.
[00:25:28.739 --> 00:25:29.559]  How do you say that?
[00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:29.779]  Salve.
[00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:30.380]  Salve?
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.200]  OK, salve.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:39.743]  Made from herbs such as chickweed, which seem to help relieve a host of skin conditions, including allergic reactions, psoriasis, oh, poison oak, and even skin cancers.
[00:25:39.763 --> 00:25:40.763]  Well, here's the problem there.
[00:25:40.783 --> 00:25:48.406]  He's talking about psoriasis, which if you watch any mainstream media TV show, one of the- Do you have severe psoriasis?
[00:25:48.546 --> 00:25:48.987]  Exactly.
[00:25:49.067 --> 00:25:52.148]  One of the ads there, oh, I've got to put on my psoriasis.
[00:25:52.648 --> 00:25:59.912]  You know, and it's just, you can't go against, you can't grow something in your backyard that will cure your psoriasis?
[00:25:59.932 --> 00:26:04.515]  Well no, if they have a prescription alternative to sell you, they're not going to want you to be able to use whatever's left.
[00:26:04.555 --> 00:26:04.895]  Sure.
[00:26:05.295 --> 00:26:06.776]  So chickweed, where does chickweed grow?
[00:26:06.796 --> 00:26:09.538]  Does he have to, does it just grow wild or does he grow it?
[00:26:09.838 --> 00:26:10.378]  How does that work?
[00:26:10.898 --> 00:26:20.804]  He probably grew some of it, but he was big enough selling to Amish communities all over the country that he actually ordered a lot of supplies of chickweed.
[00:26:21.641 --> 00:26:31.765]  But basically, they're saying that he mislabeled the drug because he had brochures with testimonials about how it helped people with skin cancer.
[00:26:31.845 --> 00:26:32.645]  Right, right.
[00:26:32.765 --> 00:26:38.988]  And he didn't write the testimonials, but he promoted the little brochures at the stores where he sold the chickweed.
[00:26:39.768 --> 00:26:39.928]  Yeah.
[00:26:39.948 --> 00:26:48.151]  So they're saying he was making medical claims, and he was selling a drug, and it was mislabeled as a drug, even though their own lab tests show that it wasn't a drug.
[00:26:52.941 --> 00:26:55.422]  A year ago, he started working with Sheriff Richard Mack.
[00:26:55.462 --> 00:26:57.183]  I'm sure you guys know of him.
[00:26:57.903 --> 00:27:02.345]  And the local sheriff notified the feds, being this situation was escalating a little.
[00:27:03.146 --> 00:27:05.167]  We got a former sheriff helping somebody out?
[00:27:05.187 --> 00:27:07.548]  We gotta get the 422 going on 673?
[00:27:08.028 --> 00:27:09.549]  He's upholding the Constitution.
[00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:10.489]  You gotta look out for him.
[00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:17.172]  So the local sheriff notified the feds that Sam Durrod is under his protective custody.
[00:27:18.257 --> 00:27:22.502]  So in January of this year, the federal marshal just snuck in and arrested him.
[00:27:22.822 --> 00:27:28.688]  He went to trial in February, was convicted of 13 counts, and his sentencing is on June 16th.
[00:27:28.809 --> 00:27:34.635]  He's facing 48 to 68 years in prison, and he's a 56-year-old, the father of 12 children.
[00:27:35.216 --> 00:27:37.278]  If he gets the full term, he'll never get out.
[00:27:38.532 --> 00:27:41.795]  And we all know we could go commit a murder and get by with less than that.
[00:27:42.075 --> 00:27:43.216]  Oh, easily, easily.
[00:27:43.616 --> 00:27:45.898]  But that's what happens when you cross the federal government.
[00:27:45.999 --> 00:27:50.002]  I tell you what, this is not getting marketed properly out to the people.
[00:27:50.563 --> 00:27:52.104]  He needs to be known as Chickweed Man.
[00:27:52.204 --> 00:27:55.908]  I know that's a little demeaning in the overall scheme of things, but...
[00:27:56.848 --> 00:28:02.750]  To get to these people on social media, you know, and the Amish kind of have a soft place in the hearts of Americans.
[00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:11.173]  They're like, oh, the Amish are, if you look at the baseline, good people who are wholesome, who are doing things right, you know, in terms of this old, old-fashioned way, it's the Amish.
[00:28:11.193 --> 00:28:12.814]  There's a high value on family values and things like that.
[00:28:12.834 --> 00:28:13.034]  Exactly.
[00:28:13.114 --> 00:28:13.594]  Twelve children.
[00:28:13.614 --> 00:28:14.194]  In your community.
[00:28:14.415 --> 00:28:14.795]  Absolutely.
[00:28:14.835 --> 00:28:16.515]  They're strong, built communities.
[00:28:16.575 --> 00:28:17.656]  People have each other's backs.
[00:28:17.856 --> 00:28:18.016]  Yeah.
[00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:20.377]  You know, they're devout in their religion.
[00:28:20.577 --> 00:28:21.457]  They have barn raisins.
[00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:23.178]  Overall, great people.
[00:28:23.538 --> 00:28:24.659]  I can't think of anything else.
[00:28:24.699 --> 00:28:25.799]  Emmanuel, how old are you, sir?
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.220]  If you don't mind me asking.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:27.460]  I'm 27.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:27.460]  27.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.302]  So you guys have a rite of passage.
[00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:30.982]  What's that called?
[00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:32.563]  Rum Springer.
[00:28:32.963 --> 00:28:33.543]  Rum Springer.
[00:28:33.563 --> 00:28:35.544]  Is that right?
[00:28:35.664 --> 00:28:37.625]  That's basically some made-up junk.
[00:28:37.705 --> 00:28:39.446]  Is it really made-up junk?
[00:28:39.486 --> 00:28:47.750]  There actually might be communities, but I've seen a lot of the stuff that was put online that people brought as print-offs about Amish here and there.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:56.965]  And a lot of what you see online about the Amish people is some truth and a lot of drama, basically.
[00:28:57.045 --> 00:28:57.866]  Well, I'm sure it is.
[00:28:58.206 --> 00:29:12.694]  But actually, when I heard about the process of it, I actually thought it was a good idea because it gave a person who wanted to get out a way to get out and a person who wanted to stay in and commit their life to the Amish lifestyle and the Amish way of life.
[00:29:12.814 --> 00:29:14.155]  You value what you have that much more.
[00:29:14.215 --> 00:29:16.616]  Exactly, and you see what you have.
[00:29:16.636 --> 00:29:20.798]  I think there's something to say for a good, simple life out there.
[00:29:20.958 --> 00:29:22.279]  I obviously didn't choose that.
[00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:26.201]  I was born into a more modern life down in Louisiana.
[00:29:26.721 --> 00:29:29.662]  But you're fully committed.
[00:29:30.923 --> 00:29:32.203]  How do you hear about InfoWars?
[00:29:32.243 --> 00:29:32.924]  How do you listen to us?
[00:29:33.324 --> 00:29:35.365]  Can you listen to us on the radio or phone or what?
[00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:36.265]  Landline phone.
[00:29:36.305 --> 00:29:37.286]  That's how I listen to you.
[00:29:37.446 --> 00:29:38.106]  Landline phone?
[00:29:38.146 --> 00:29:39.187]  Oh, you just call in the number.
[00:29:39.387 --> 00:29:39.587]  Okay.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.640]  Well, you've got some listen lines.
[00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:42.241]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:44.561]  And I got started through GCN.
[00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:45.662]  Okay.
[00:29:45.822 --> 00:29:51.903]  And then eventually I got turned on to you guys' listen lines so I can listen to like the special broadcast that's going on right now.
[00:29:52.303 --> 00:29:52.543]  Right.
[00:29:54.044 --> 00:29:55.064]  Well, that's awesome.
[00:29:55.144 --> 00:29:56.305]  And are you a farmer as well?
[00:29:57.745 --> 00:30:03.146]  I have a small farm and I have like a natural herbal and supplement store.
[00:30:04.647 --> 00:30:04.947]  Okay.
[00:30:05.007 --> 00:30:06.907]  Do nutritional counseling for people, yeah.
[00:30:07.088 --> 00:30:07.428]  Yeah.
[00:30:07.508 --> 00:30:08.468]  Oh, excellent, excellent.
[00:30:09.178 --> 00:30:17.743]  Well, I tell you what, I think Chickweed Man needs to be talked about because why are we going to put a guy who has 12 kids in jail for 48 years for making something that helps people?
[00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:20.284]  But that's the problem with our country, you know?
[00:30:20.344 --> 00:30:29.909]  And then we have James Comey who talks about how nauseous he is that he actually had to say something about Hillary Clinton's email investigation right before an election.
[00:30:29.949 --> 00:30:30.909]  That made him nauseous.
[00:30:30.949 --> 00:30:33.651]  Yeah, they feel bad about going after bad people.
[00:30:33.851 --> 00:30:34.211]  Yeah.
[00:30:34.231 --> 00:30:37.014]  When it comes to going after good people, they'll do it all day.
[00:30:37.034 --> 00:30:39.196]  This good guy, we gotta put him in jail.
[00:30:39.276 --> 00:30:42.539]  He made a, he made a, somebody made a claim and he repeated it.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.661]  How dare he?
[00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:46.784]  That's the problem with these big, these big organizations.
[00:30:47.164 --> 00:30:49.466]  You know, Trump, they're saying Trump's gonna get rid of the EPA.
[00:30:49.826 --> 00:30:51.808]  It looks like he's gonna get rid of the Department of Education.
[00:30:52.873 --> 00:30:54.514]  I think these programs need to go.
[00:30:54.534 --> 00:30:55.314]  They failed.
[00:30:55.774 --> 00:30:56.294]  They failed.
[00:30:56.634 --> 00:30:58.095]  We didn't educate any people.
[00:30:58.355 --> 00:30:59.416]  Well, let the states run this.
[00:30:59.456 --> 00:31:01.936]  These things were created at a different time.
[00:31:02.397 --> 00:31:15.462]  We've got a lot better communication technology around in the world, in the United States especially, and I don't think we need to be dictating how our minds are being molded by the federal government.
[00:31:15.662 --> 00:31:16.822]  I think that's the wrong thing.
[00:31:16.882 --> 00:31:18.803]  Hey, Emmanuel, you got anything else?
[00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:24.545]  I was wondering if I could give out a website for people where they could sign a petition.
[00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:27.726]  We're looking to try to get 50,000 to 100,000 signatures.
[00:31:27.766 --> 00:31:32.088]  So far we've got over 25,000 and I was just trying to get this ball rolling.
[00:31:32.668 --> 00:31:44.213]  KentuckyFreePress.com or you can always go to, I'm sure, Mac's website FreedomCoalition.com and there's like a hotline where people can call.
[00:31:45.473 --> 00:31:45.974]  The number is 888-234-1272.
[00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:53.953]  Normally we don't let people give out numbers like that, but it is an 888 number.
[00:31:54.313 --> 00:31:59.556]  So, that's usually... Yeah, here I'm at KentuckyFreePress.com, a political watchdog publication.
[00:32:00.036 --> 00:32:06.859]  And then they have the complete story of Kentucky Amish farmer Samuel Gerard vs. the FDA.
[00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:08.660]  Looking at 68 years in prison.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.222]  There's a change.org petition, it looks like.
[00:32:11.502 --> 00:32:12.562]  Is that the one you're talking about with the 24,000?
[00:32:12.762 --> 00:32:13.363]  Yes.
[00:32:13.383 --> 00:32:17.385]  Is that when you click on the complete story?
[00:32:18.453 --> 00:32:29.842]  Yeah, so there's a page, KentuckyFreePress.com, we need to put this out as a piece as soon as possible on our YouTube site and talk about this.
[00:32:29.902 --> 00:32:37.188]  But there, look, rosemary, beeswax, olive oil, peppermint, chickweed, eucalyptus, lavender, and what's that, comfrey?
[00:32:37.648 --> 00:32:38.049]  Camfrey.
[00:32:38.129 --> 00:32:38.569]  Camfrey?
[00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.710]  What is that?
[00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.451]  I don't know.
[00:32:41.732 --> 00:32:43.293]  Somebody just yelled it in there, what'd y'all say?
[00:32:45.097 --> 00:32:45.497]  Comfrey.
[00:32:45.818 --> 00:32:46.258]  Comfrey.
[00:32:46.638 --> 00:32:47.319]  Alright, what is that?
[00:32:47.339 --> 00:32:48.299]  Do you know what that is, Daria?
[00:32:50.041 --> 00:32:53.203]  Um, I'm actually not sure exactly what it is, but I know it's good for you.
[00:32:53.744 --> 00:32:56.265]  Comfrey, another name for Comfrey is Nip Bone.
[00:32:56.826 --> 00:32:57.166]  Is what?
[00:32:57.186 --> 00:32:57.687]  Nip Bone?
[00:32:58.067 --> 00:32:58.527]  Nip Bone.
[00:32:58.807 --> 00:32:59.688]  Alright, alright.
[00:32:59.848 --> 00:33:10.616]  So we're trying to get this in front of Trump, and I think it would actually be a feather in Trump's cap if he would see this situation and sign a presidential pardon.
[00:33:10.676 --> 00:33:12.438]  Pardon this man immediately!
[00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:15.821]  And we have tried to get Rand Paul on board.
[00:33:15.901 --> 00:33:22.952]  Rand Paul supports it, but he doesn't want to be the one to carry it in front of Trump, which he'd have the power to do that tomorrow if he'd want to.
[00:33:24.755 --> 00:33:26.678]  So we're having a hard time getting to Trump.
[00:33:27.659 --> 00:33:29.180]  We're just going to keep choking away at it.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.143]  Well we do have a Roger Stone on our side.
[00:33:32.203 --> 00:33:33.804]  Maybe he can get something in front of Trump.
[00:33:34.765 --> 00:33:39.588]  Maybe we'll put together a real short version of this and let people know.
[00:33:40.229 --> 00:33:42.491]  And people out there, tweet Trump right now.
[00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:43.251]  Let him know about this.
[00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:46.334]  Tweet him this link at KentuckyFreePress.com.
[00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:49.372]  And that's ridiculous.
[00:33:49.993 --> 00:33:52.315]  Making a little homeopathic remedy.
[00:33:52.575 --> 00:33:54.316]  He's not cutting into their business any.
[00:33:54.817 --> 00:33:55.778]  But they don't like it.
[00:33:55.818 --> 00:33:57.139]  He said it might help with cancer.
[00:33:57.159 --> 00:33:59.301]  It's being mainly used by the Amish community.
[00:33:59.341 --> 00:34:02.403]  From what this is saying, it's being mainly used by this community.
[00:34:04.045 --> 00:34:06.927]  Is that your experience with the things you make and sell?
[00:34:08.849 --> 00:34:13.092]  I don't currently make any product because I'm almost scared to.
[00:34:13.132 --> 00:34:14.954]  I'm having some of my own product line made.
[00:34:15.547 --> 00:34:27.354]  Made, but I get them made by an FDA-registered company, just like you guys do, because I know we definitely get in trouble if we... Well, we can't have anybody doing something different around here.
[00:34:27.454 --> 00:34:28.495]  You know, this is America.
[00:34:28.915 --> 00:34:30.516]  The government's got to have their hands in everything.
[00:34:30.576 --> 00:34:31.016]  Exactly.
[00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:32.798]  Hey, let me ask you one more question.
[00:34:33.398 --> 00:34:42.744]  What is the... because a lot of people say Amish kids don't have autism, and I'm kind of a vaccine... I wouldn't say I'm a vaccine buff, but I know a lot about vaccines having four kids.
[00:34:43.744 --> 00:34:46.646]  What is the, I guess, incidence?
[00:34:46.726 --> 00:34:54.751]  Do Amish kids get vaccinated and do you guys see the same kind of prevalence of autism in your communities that we see out in ours?
[00:34:56.352 --> 00:35:01.755]  Well, our family has never vaccinated their kids.
[00:35:02.455 --> 00:35:08.079]  And I'm noticing that more and more people in the Amish community are vaccinating children.
[00:35:08.319 --> 00:35:11.101]  And, you know, I do nutritional counseling.
[00:35:11.141 --> 00:35:13.022]  I've seen more and more people come in with
[00:35:15.089 --> 00:35:19.472]  Kids that are going to school having ADD, ADHD and that type of thing.
[00:35:19.532 --> 00:35:29.477]  I see that a lot anymore and I think it's the preservatives and the GMO and the food that they're eating because we're not completely clear of that either.
[00:35:29.517 --> 00:35:38.341]  We try to raise a lot of stuff in our garden and grow it naturally but among the Amish there's even a lot of people that don't even care about that as more.
[00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:39.282]  It's changing.
[00:35:40.862 --> 00:35:43.924]  But back in the 80s when we still lived in Delaware
[00:35:44.745 --> 00:35:51.669]  Um, the local health department tried to force the Amish to vaccinate their children, um, to go to their, to our own parochial schools.
[00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:57.453]  And there was only like a couple guys that kicked up about it was my dad and another, and another guy.
[00:35:58.274 --> 00:36:01.756]  And they said they weren't going to allow them to vaccinate their children.
[00:36:02.436 --> 00:36:06.939]  So they, they put up a meeting at, um, at the local schoolhouse.
[00:36:07.939 --> 00:36:08.480]  I think so.
[00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:25.642]  I think so.
[00:36:53.104 --> 00:36:56.326]  After they got done with their speeches, they say, Okay, anybody got any questions?
[00:36:57.587 --> 00:37:04.890]  So dad, he just stood up and read off this little ad about some horrible side effects, and then some ingredients that were in the vaccine.
[00:37:05.651 --> 00:37:08.693]  And they said, Oh, yeah, that's just one in a million.
[00:37:09.573 --> 00:37:14.456]  And then they say, Okay, anybody got anything else?
[00:37:14.936 --> 00:37:21.339]  So somebody hands dad a clipping from a newspaper that they have brought along and said, Hey, read this.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:22.300]  So
[00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:33.175]  He gets up and starts reading that, and it was about a case where they vaccinated a child, and he went into a coma, they life-flighted him to another hospital, and he barely survived it.
[00:37:33.975 --> 00:37:39.198]  So he read that story, and by that time, the atmosphere in the room was just changing.
[00:37:39.918 --> 00:37:49.883]  So the doctor says, oh yeah, that was just one in a million, and this older Amish lady in the front gets up and shakes her finger in the doctor's face and says, would you want that to happen to your child?
[00:37:49.903 --> 00:37:51.464]  And he said no, and he just sat down.
[00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.891]  Yeah.
[00:37:54.051 --> 00:37:55.971]  That's the way you ask a doctor a question, too.
[00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:57.232]  Would you do that for your child?
[00:37:57.312 --> 00:38:00.774]  If you ask them what you do for them, they usually go, oh, I can't answer that.
[00:38:00.814 --> 00:38:02.074]  But you say, would you do it to your child?
[00:38:02.114 --> 00:38:03.475]  No, answer that, which is interesting.
[00:38:03.955 --> 00:38:04.395]  Just a little tip.
[00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:07.877]  Dan said he was never in a room where there was such a united feeling.
[00:38:07.917 --> 00:38:11.158]  He said he could feel everybody in the room was against vaccines at that point.
[00:38:11.198 --> 00:38:12.279]  There was no more questions.
[00:38:12.779 --> 00:38:15.700]  And the doctors seemed that they were up against the wall.
[00:38:16.101 --> 00:38:21.063]  So the school board went up and asked, they said, is there no way you can exempt these people from vaccinating their children?
[00:38:21.887 --> 00:38:27.514]  And the word that that doctor said, he said it would be a felony for us to force them to vaccinate their children.
[00:38:27.574 --> 00:38:28.796]  And it was the end of the matter.
[00:38:30.013 --> 00:38:38.039]  Yes, it still is a felony in some states, although California seems to have changed its ways, which I'm glad I'm not anywhere near California.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:44.624]  Emmanuel, thanks for calling and dropping knowledge this morning on the people here watching the 30 plus hour broadcast.

[00:39:12.369 --> 00:39:13.410]  Getting the conversation going.
[00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:21.517]  We need to take back our culture that's been, you know, annihilated by, you know, I guess just sycophantic people.
[00:39:22.017 --> 00:39:30.845]  We need to take back our government that's overly bloated and doesn't care about anyone other than giant, giant corporations and multinational banks.
[00:39:31.765 --> 00:39:35.088]  So by going to InfoWarsStore.com, you help

[00:40:07.454 --> 00:40:09.755]  It has been, and let's see.
[00:40:09.795 --> 00:40:13.778]  I had some friends of mine sending me messages saying, where's the break force?
[00:40:14.018 --> 00:40:14.718]  No, DNA Force.
[00:40:15.458 --> 00:40:16.579]  Could you get me any DNA Force?
[00:40:16.659 --> 00:40:18.240]  I was like, well, it's out of stock.
[00:40:19.025 --> 00:40:20.887]  Why don't you read everybody a review there?
[00:40:20.987 --> 00:40:25.811]  We've got a review here for Super Blue Toothpaste, which is what I've been using at home since we came out with it.
[00:40:26.112 --> 00:40:27.693]  I brushed my teeth with it right before I went on the air.
[00:40:27.713 --> 00:40:28.434]  That stuff sold out too.
[00:40:29.504 --> 00:40:32.725]  Very quickly, when we first came out with it, there's two flavors now.
[00:40:32.765 --> 00:40:34.305]  I think some more on the way.
[00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:35.665]  Five stars.
[00:40:35.745 --> 00:40:36.725]  Recommend everyone try this.
[00:40:36.765 --> 00:40:37.806]  Definitely my new brand.
[00:40:38.006 --> 00:40:40.106]  This toothpaste is one of the best kinds I've ever had.
[00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:44.467]  It actually makes your mouth feel clean, clean, and the taste is above average for sure.
[00:40:44.887 --> 00:40:46.207]  Definitely recommend everyone try it.
[00:40:46.247 --> 00:40:48.368]  Thank you, M4's team, for developing such a great product.
[00:40:48.928 --> 00:40:52.488]  So the Super Blue Toothpaste, it has colloidal silver in it.
[00:40:52.708 --> 00:40:55.549]  It has nascent iodine in it, tea tree oil.
[00:40:56.599 --> 00:41:07.023]  Much of other things that are good for you, unlike the fluoride toothpaste, there's many negative effects of ingesting fluoride, putting that in your body.
[00:41:08.423 --> 00:41:09.764]  So you can get that at M4 Store.
[00:41:10.024 --> 00:41:13.085]  There's the original flavor, and there's also the bubblegum flavor.
[00:41:13.105 --> 00:41:16.466]  I haven't tried the bubblegum yet.
[00:41:16.786 --> 00:41:17.306]  Bubblegum's good.
[00:41:17.326 --> 00:41:18.047]  I've heard it's very good.
[00:41:18.067 --> 00:41:19.907]  Bubblegum's good, and the other one's good.
[00:41:20.487 --> 00:41:21.508]  Here it is, here it is.
[00:41:22.728 --> 00:41:24.669]  This is one of the best testimonials we have.
[00:41:26.112 --> 00:41:27.333]  Out there on the interweb.
[00:41:29.035 --> 00:41:30.897]  Guys, can you pull this up?
[00:41:30.917 --> 00:41:31.757]  24,000 views.
[00:41:31.777 --> 00:41:33.379]  24,000 views, went up in mid-April.
[00:41:33.799 --> 00:41:36.121]  InfoWars toothpaste ruined my teeth.
[00:41:37.042 --> 00:41:38.724]  I like the toothpaste smelling too.
[00:41:39.024 --> 00:41:41.887]  You gotta go watch Ethan's testimonial.
[00:41:41.927 --> 00:41:43.188]  He gives it right to ya.
[00:41:43.468 --> 00:41:43.909]  All the way.
[00:41:43.969 --> 00:41:44.830]  Super Blue toothpaste.
[00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:46.751]  He talks about what it's done for him.
[00:41:48.038 --> 00:41:49.559]  And he's a good guy.
[00:41:49.919 --> 00:41:51.659]  He's got some good stuff going on.
[00:41:51.719 --> 00:41:53.220]  He knows how to make a title.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.780]  He knows how to get a clickbait title.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.541]  He's got another one.
[00:41:55.981 --> 00:41:57.941]  Alex Jones, actor and big fat liar.
[00:41:57.961 --> 00:41:59.042]  That's another good one.
[00:41:59.062 --> 00:42:00.682]  He actually is really good.
[00:42:00.702 --> 00:42:02.543]  He puts these titles out to wake people up.
[00:42:03.163 --> 00:42:04.624]  He sort of hijacks memes.
[00:42:04.684 --> 00:42:06.624]  I was ready to rage because it works for me great.
[00:42:07.765 --> 00:42:10.986]  The top comment on that is another positive review.
[00:42:11.326 --> 00:42:12.907]  Go read the reviews for yourself.
[00:42:12.967 --> 00:42:15.948]  There are thousands of reviews on almost all of these products.
[00:42:16.168 --> 00:42:16.668]  Look at this one.
[00:42:17.489 --> 00:42:18.990]  142,000 views.
[00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.013]  She does, this lady, Karen Kennedy, if this is her name.
[00:42:22.033 --> 00:42:22.974]  I've watched a few of hers.
[00:42:23.014 --> 00:42:23.915]  Does this channel.
[00:42:24.015 --> 00:42:26.338]  She does a 30 minute plug of all of our stuff.
[00:42:26.458 --> 00:42:26.758]  Wow.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.801]  And that was just put up in April.
[00:42:28.821 --> 00:42:29.061]  140,000 views.
[00:42:29.101 --> 00:42:30.903]  That's how you spread the word.
[00:42:31.624 --> 00:42:31.884]  Okay?
[00:42:33.005 --> 00:42:34.527]  And hey, the hate's gonna come.
[00:42:35.187 --> 00:42:36.409]  The mainstream media hates us.
[00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:38.790]  The press hates us.
[00:42:39.731 --> 00:42:40.831]  Hillary Clinton hates us.
[00:42:41.151 --> 00:42:42.212]  John Podesta hates us.
[00:42:42.312 --> 00:42:44.153]  Media Matters really hates us.
[00:42:44.853 --> 00:42:45.794]  Antifa hates us.
[00:42:46.114 --> 00:42:48.035]  I think they probably have a guy at Media Matters.
[00:42:48.615 --> 00:42:50.416]  He's probably watching right now, so good morning to you.
[00:42:50.996 --> 00:42:53.457]  Watching everything we say so they can type up a little article.
[00:42:53.657 --> 00:42:54.658]  I'm gonna get him on this one.
[00:42:55.158 --> 00:42:56.118]  I'm gonna get him on this one.
[00:42:56.138 --> 00:42:57.219]  I have so much outrage.
[00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:02.045]  In fact, guys, at some point, oh, we're going to bring in Harrison Schmidt here.
[00:43:02.065 --> 00:43:08.734]  Let's go to a, I guess, a short break real quick and we'll go to, or you can bring up, do you have our video by any chance?
[00:43:08.754 --> 00:43:11.578]  Yeah, we have two clips on there.
[00:43:11.978 --> 00:43:13.701]  We have an Antifa one.
[00:43:13.721 --> 00:43:14.742]  Yeah.
[00:43:15.042 --> 00:43:16.324]  Let's play the Antifa clip.
[00:43:16.564 --> 00:43:16.865]  You ready?
[00:43:19.241 --> 00:43:21.082]  Alright, let's do it and then we'll get Harrison in here.
[00:43:21.422 --> 00:43:22.683]  He had some news he wanted to bring in.
[00:43:22.703 --> 00:43:26.945]  He's one of our technical guy editors and he also has done some pretty good reports for us.
[00:43:27.005 --> 00:43:30.427]  So, we're gonna bring him on in here and we'll be right back after this short break.
[00:43:30.447 --> 00:43:31.848]  Thanks for watching InfoWars.com.
[00:43:31.868 --> 00:43:35.609]  Forward slash show is the free stream to send to everybody you know right now.
[00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:36.610]  Wake up everybody!
[00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.612]  We're back on the air live, live, live!
[00:43:39.632 --> 00:43:41.633]  F*** InfoWars!
[00:43:41.713 --> 00:43:42.593]  Did your mommy not love you?
[00:43:42.793 --> 00:43:43.794]  F*** InfoWars!
[00:43:43.894 --> 00:43:46.695]  You're out here protesting, you're protesting capitalism today?
[00:43:46.775 --> 00:43:47.796]  F*** InfoWars!
[00:44:01.981 --> 00:44:02.942]  So, what's going on today?
[00:44:03.102 --> 00:44:05.744]  You guys are making me laugh.
[00:44:05.884 --> 00:44:07.346]  Oh yeah, look at that.
[00:44:07.386 --> 00:44:08.947]  Do you have to spray anybody today?
[00:44:19.149 --> 00:44:30.992]  What they haven't learned is that this is a bastion of free speech here and we're allowing these people to walk up and down and they're celebrating people who are oppressive and who kill people.
[00:44:31.552 --> 00:44:36.213]  Communist regimes have killed millions if not hundreds of thousands of people and here they are celebrating.
[00:44:36.293 --> 00:44:38.093]  And fascist regimes and communist regimes.
[00:44:38.133 --> 00:44:40.554]  They admitted that they're fascist and Nazis.
[00:44:40.574 --> 00:44:41.514]  I think they're joking.
[00:44:42.603 --> 00:44:44.505]  But you guys aren't joking, that's the funny thing.
[00:44:44.545 --> 00:44:45.986]  You're very serious about what you're doing.
[00:44:46.006 --> 00:44:47.607]  We're not joking about being racist.
[00:44:47.647 --> 00:44:48.207]  You know what's funny?
[00:44:48.247 --> 00:44:49.608]  He's got the racist symbol.
[00:44:49.629 --> 00:44:50.429]  Oh my god, look!
[00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:52.130]  Oh, we found the racist symbol!
[00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:52.831]  Look at that!
[00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:55.773]  Oh yeah, we're... We've been doing Nazi symbols all day.
[00:44:55.833 --> 00:44:58.876]  The frog is a Nazi symbol, you got... Yes, yes it is.
[00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:05.611]  How many people do you want to kill with your revolution?
[00:45:05.631 --> 00:45:05.771]  Good.
[00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:08.272]  What are you protesting today?
[00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.294]  We're protesting capitalism.
[00:45:11.014 --> 00:45:11.534]  The evils.
[00:45:11.554 --> 00:45:12.655]  The evils of capitalism.
[00:45:13.295 --> 00:45:13.935]  It's terrible.
[00:45:14.256 --> 00:45:15.896]  And what are you going to replace it with?
[00:45:16.417 --> 00:45:16.957]  Communism.
[00:45:18.478 --> 00:45:20.419]  How many people are you going to kill to replace it with communism?
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.220]  By any means necessary.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.963]  Oh yeah, we're also replacing the First Amendment.
[00:45:29.419 --> 00:45:30.040]  No more hate speech.
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:30.880]  No First Amendment.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.761]  No more hate speech.
[00:45:31.781 --> 00:45:32.041]  See?
[00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:35.063]  The term snowflake comes from Nazi Germany.
[00:45:35.083 --> 00:45:38.325]  When they would burn the Jews, the ashes that would fall, they would call them snowflakes.
[00:45:39.926 --> 00:45:40.406]  Here they come.
[00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:41.547]  Now they're all holding hands again.
[00:45:41.567 --> 00:45:42.767]  This is how they have to cross the street.
[00:45:42.807 --> 00:45:45.089]  They've been... I guess they've taught... Listen to their parents.
[00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:46.049]  They're all holding hands.
[00:45:46.209 --> 00:45:47.030]  We resist.
[00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:48.091]  We much.
[00:45:48.891 --> 00:45:49.431]  We must.
[00:45:50.232 --> 00:45:54.054]  And we will much about that be committed.
[00:45:55.695 --> 00:45:57.056]  How would they survive in Venezuela?
[00:45:57.076 --> 00:45:58.036]  You think they'd make it long?
[00:45:58.496 --> 00:46:05.680]  Um, I think that they would start eating the rats first, but then once they ran out of rats, they'd start eating each other, and then they'd probably, I don't know, like, die.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.021]  Whose streets?
[00:46:09.221 --> 00:46:11.022]  Our streets!
[00:46:27.674 --> 00:46:32.040]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:46:32.141 --> 00:46:43.097]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:46:43.257 --> 00:46:48.198]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:46:48.319 --> 00:46:50.819]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:46:50.879 --> 00:46:52.380]  It helps detoxify.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.441]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:46:55.481 --> 00:47:00.242]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:47:00.262 --> 00:47:06.484]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:47:06.504 --> 00:47:11.826]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:47:11.946 --> 00:47:12.606]  I'm taking it now.
[00:47:13.567 --> 00:47:14.288]  This is so key.
[00:47:14.548 --> 00:47:16.871]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[00:47:17.111 --> 00:47:18.854]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:47:18.874 --> 00:47:20.957]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:47:21.097 --> 00:47:24.562]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:47:27.861 --> 00:47:32.202]  Welcome back to the Defense of Free Speech 30-hour plus broadcast.
[00:47:32.262 --> 00:47:35.904]  I'm your host Rob Dew, got Michael Zimmerman, and also joining us, Harrison Smith.
[00:47:36.644 --> 00:47:39.045]  But I want to get to this breaking news first.
[00:47:39.145 --> 00:47:43.186]  Series of explosions rock Madrid, leaving at least 15 injured.
[00:47:43.246 --> 00:47:46.127]  Cause of the blast in tourism hotspot unknown.
[00:47:46.147 --> 00:47:48.407]  Anybody want to speculate?
[00:47:49.708 --> 00:47:50.368]  The Amish, maybe?
[00:47:51.748 --> 00:47:52.109]  I don't know.
[00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.509]  Probably not.
[00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:56.110]  I'm guessing Islamic terror, as it usually is.
[00:47:57.612 --> 00:48:00.196]  And, uh, you know, we had, what was it?
[00:48:00.216 --> 00:48:08.048]  But, you know, the, Sadiq Khan says, uh, dealing with terrorism is just part of living in a, in a big city and it's just part of our way of life now.
[00:48:08.088 --> 00:48:09.570]  We all have to accept terrorism and...
[00:48:10.253 --> 00:48:11.474]  You know, get used to it.
[00:48:11.594 --> 00:48:16.457]  That's right, and that's the Mayor of London, for those of you who don't know and who are keeping score at home.
[00:48:16.797 --> 00:48:27.865]  Now Donald Trump came out with a tweet in response to Susan Rice refusing to testify in the Senate Subcommittee next week on allegations of unmasking Trump officials.
[00:48:28.325 --> 00:48:28.405]  Oh!
[00:48:29.451 --> 00:48:31.833]  Well now we don't have to hear her take the fifth over and over again.
[00:48:32.393 --> 00:48:33.534]  Because that's what she's going to do.
[00:48:34.294 --> 00:48:35.796]  She's going to run for cover.
[00:48:35.816 --> 00:48:37.016]  Now Harrison's got some articles.
[00:48:37.036 --> 00:48:39.038]  Harrison, what do you have in store for us?
[00:48:39.098 --> 00:48:41.840]  These are very important, very important articles.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.123]  Because it turns out they're turning the frickin' birds gay.
[00:48:46.303 --> 00:48:48.224]  This is National Geographic.
[00:48:48.244 --> 00:48:50.746]  This is a very serious article from National Geographic.
[00:48:51.167 --> 00:48:52.948]  Mercury poisoning makes birds gay.
[00:48:53.228 --> 00:48:54.248]  You're a conspiracy theorist!
[00:48:54.268 --> 00:48:55.729]  Yeah, they're gonna say this is fake news now.
[00:48:55.889 --> 00:48:58.969]  Are you sure you're not making up fake news from National Geographic?
[00:48:58.989 --> 00:49:02.070]  No, I'm reporting this very real news from National Geographic.
[00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:06.651]  I'm sure it's in a number of other scientific journals and research papers, much like the Atrocene and Frogs is.
[00:49:07.231 --> 00:49:09.471]  The media loves to call Alex out on that.
[00:49:09.511 --> 00:49:12.192]  They love to call informers out on that and go, oh, the gay frogs!
[00:49:12.272 --> 00:49:12.892]  Oh, gay frogs!
[00:49:13.172 --> 00:49:14.032]  Right, it's funny, right?
[00:49:14.232 --> 00:49:18.293]  This is from a UC Berkeley study, you know, a peer-reviewed study.
[00:49:18.393 --> 00:49:18.873]  It doesn't matter.
[00:49:18.893 --> 00:49:19.313]  No, it doesn't matter.
[00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:20.234]  Your facts are irrelevant.
[00:49:20.754 --> 00:49:22.314]  We're gonna make fun of spider goats, too.
[00:49:22.854 --> 00:49:25.677]  I'm just going to laugh at it.
[00:49:25.717 --> 00:49:27.618]  And actually, I think it's kind of sad.
[00:49:27.638 --> 00:49:36.226]  There's this line, these male-male pairs did everything that a heterosexual pair would do, it's just no babies came at the end of it.
[00:49:36.246 --> 00:49:38.247]  Which is kind of sad to me, at least if you're
[00:49:39.088 --> 00:49:43.871]  A gay human person, you actually understand what is going on and what you're doing.
[00:49:43.891 --> 00:49:48.114]  You don't see any gay couples, like, taking a pregnancy test and being really sad.
[00:49:48.214 --> 00:49:49.835]  Oh no, it didn't work again.
[00:49:49.995 --> 00:49:52.817]  Right, the crib they just set up isn't going to be used.
[00:49:52.877 --> 00:50:00.342]  Yeah, they build their nest and... Well, there's a lot of issues with Mercury, and we did an interview with RFK Jr.
[00:50:01.483 --> 00:50:02.783]  In Washington, D.C.
[00:50:02.963 --> 00:50:05.864]  And actually, in the past hour, there's a vaccine report.
[00:50:06.544 --> 00:50:21.548]  We talked to the filmmaker of Vaxxed, and it was that same day we interviewed Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and he's been working to eliminate mercury in our water, in our, you know, food, things like that, and vaccines now for many years.
[00:50:21.648 --> 00:50:24.848]  But he's called crazy because mercury's good for you, fluoride's good for you.
[00:50:24.868 --> 00:50:25.628]  Of course.
[00:50:25.668 --> 00:50:26.889]  You want both of those in your body.
[00:50:27.149 --> 00:50:27.569]  Naturally.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.541]  You know, remember he was traveling with that documentary filmmaker, Robert F. Kennedy?
[00:50:32.141 --> 00:50:57.608]  He sent me a preview copy of his documentary on mercury, and one of the images they show in this, I'll just give away a small part, but you could probably find, we could probably find this here, and it was a mercury, or it was an aluminum kind of I-beam, and it had mercury put on top of it, and you see what mercury and aluminum do together, and then you know that aluminum is in almost every vaccine as an adjuvant,
[00:50:58.288 --> 00:50:59.649]  And it reacting with the mercury.
[00:50:59.669 --> 00:51:00.970]  Think of that as your brain.
[00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:03.751]  What goes on in your brain as you're getting sizzled.
[00:51:04.251 --> 00:51:07.533]  A little chemical lobotomy, courtesy of the eugenicist.
[00:51:08.054 --> 00:51:19.880]  And this was, in this article, this wasn't happening in, well it probably is happening in nature, but essentially these birds, they're sea birds and they get a lot of mercury from shellfish and different fish that they eat.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:26.124]  And so this was a controlled scientific experiment that turned the birds gay.
[00:51:26.929 --> 00:51:29.431]  They're turning the frickin' birds gay, people!
[00:51:29.611 --> 00:51:30.291]  You need some of these.
[00:51:30.311 --> 00:51:30.431]  Yeah.
[00:51:30.451 --> 00:51:30.911]  You gotta.
[00:51:31.071 --> 00:51:33.973]  They're turning the frickin' birds gay!
[00:51:34.794 --> 00:51:36.195]  They're turning the birds gay!
[00:51:36.215 --> 00:51:37.775]  You need more brain force.
[00:51:38.136 --> 00:51:38.836]  You're not feeling it.
[00:51:38.856 --> 00:51:39.617]  I can tell you're not.
[00:51:40.477 --> 00:51:42.738]  Let's go to Pete in Michigan.
[00:51:43.879 --> 00:51:45.760]  Big fan of InfoWars products.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.001]  Pete, you're on the air.
[00:51:48.042 --> 00:51:48.662]  Yes, sir!
[00:51:48.842 --> 00:51:51.924]  I'm just a first-time caller, a long-time listener.
[00:51:51.944 --> 00:51:54.345]  Just wanted to say thank you guys for spreading the word.
[00:51:54.485 --> 00:51:55.346]  You guys are awesome.
[00:51:56.073 --> 00:51:56.473]  Excellent.
[00:51:56.693 --> 00:51:59.174]  And what products are you a fan of since you brought it up?
[00:52:00.094 --> 00:52:03.295]  You know, I have taken everything, honestly.
[00:52:03.555 --> 00:52:10.998]  All except for Secret 12, which I have a boatload of energy anyways, and the Bio PCA.
[00:52:11.058 --> 00:52:12.778]  Those are the only two I have not taken.
[00:52:13.798 --> 00:52:15.399]  Yeah, my hair and nails grow fast.
[00:52:16.279 --> 00:52:17.379]  I don't need any more.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:22.761]  Actually, I've noticed just on DNA Force, I need a haircut right now.
[00:52:22.981 --> 00:52:25.602]  I need to get one every, you know, three, four weeks anyway.
[00:52:26.147 --> 00:52:26.928]  Yeah, I have to get a haircut.
[00:52:26.948 --> 00:52:27.208]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:27.228 --> 00:52:29.929]  I have to get a haircut, honestly, about every eight days.
[00:52:29.949 --> 00:52:30.230]  I'm not lying.
[00:52:41.044 --> 00:52:48.088]  The bio PCA and the DNA force, you might have some actual issues with your hair growing so fast.
[00:52:48.108 --> 00:52:50.649]  I'll be one of those yogis with the 15 inch nails.
[00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:54.791]  Well, and then you can take caveman too and look like a caveman.
[00:52:54.831 --> 00:52:55.411]  There you go.
[00:52:55.431 --> 00:52:56.412]  Pete, anything else?
[00:52:56.432 --> 00:53:00.334]  Do you have any news this morning in Michigan?
[00:53:00.354 --> 00:53:01.334]  What's going on in Michigan?
[00:53:02.455 --> 00:53:03.035]  You know what?
[00:53:03.355 --> 00:53:06.497]  It's a sad situation here in Flint.
[00:53:06.597 --> 00:53:09.058]  I don't know if they're ever going to get the problem resolved.
[00:53:09.694 --> 00:53:10.915]  Uh, the lead is crazy.
[00:53:11.215 --> 00:53:11.415]  Yeah.
[00:53:11.635 --> 00:53:20.839]  Thankfully, my family and I, we just moved literally, uh, probably about six months ago, uh, about 40 miles east now of Flint.
[00:53:21.039 --> 00:53:28.182]  So, um, thankfully enough, we're, we're far enough away now, um, where we don't really have to worry about the water.
[00:53:28.242 --> 00:53:33.904]  But thankfully for you guys, I bought the big, uh, the big water filtration system.
[00:53:34.124 --> 00:53:36.745]  So, uh, again, you guys are great.
[00:53:36.765 --> 00:53:38.506]  Uh, I had asthma years ago.
[00:53:39.178 --> 00:53:48.265]  Due to your product, Lung Cleanse, Colloidal Silver, that stuff has changed my life.
[00:53:48.445 --> 00:53:50.506]  I'm no longer going to the doctor anymore.
[00:53:50.546 --> 00:53:59.653]  I was living in the doctor's office every month, calling into work probably every three weeks, and you know what?
[00:53:59.673 --> 00:54:06.058]  I started taking your product over three and a half years ago, listening to you guys for five years, and you guys have changed my life.
[00:54:06.118 --> 00:54:06.478]  Thank you.
[00:54:07.128 --> 00:54:08.669]  Well thank you, Pete, for that message.
[00:54:08.689 --> 00:54:09.930]  That really means a lot to us.
[00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:16.213]  I'm a lung cleanse user and a Silver Bullet user as well, and I think it's fantastic stuff.
[00:54:16.673 --> 00:54:18.715]  We have really bad allergies this year.
[00:54:18.815 --> 00:54:24.198]  The allergy season just keeps extending and extending in Austin, and now it's like windy.
[00:54:25.168 --> 00:54:27.949]  But there's so much crap in the air, you can't really have your window open.
[00:54:27.969 --> 00:54:32.310]  Well, like Alex said on the show yesterday, he knows people here in Austin who can't get out of bed.
[00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:33.350]  Yeah, it's bad.
[00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:34.190]  It's debilitating.
[00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:34.810]  It's real bad.
[00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:39.291]  And I'll tell you what, when I got that and started taking lung cleanse, I could feel the bronchitis coming.
[00:54:39.411 --> 00:54:40.312]  I was able to fight it off.
[00:54:40.372 --> 00:54:40.732]  Absolutely.
[00:54:40.972 --> 00:54:43.172]  So you mentioned Flint and the water there.
[00:54:43.292 --> 00:54:44.773]  So that still is an ongoing issue.
[00:54:45.333 --> 00:54:47.613]  And I covered that with Leanne about a year ago.
[00:54:48.934 --> 00:54:50.234]  We flew to Flint.
[00:54:51.275 --> 00:54:53.736]  And we were covering the whole water crisis there.
[00:54:54.116 --> 00:54:55.797]  So yesterday this came out.
[00:54:55.817 --> 00:55:00.260]  The City of Flint is threatening 8,000 homeowners with foreclosure over unpaid water bills.
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:02.961]  So the water is poisoning these people.
[00:55:02.981 --> 00:55:04.502]  It has lead in it.
[00:55:05.559 --> 00:55:12.641]  When people say, no, I'm not going to pay my water bill because you're sending me poison down the pipe, they're threatening to take people's homes away at this point.
[00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:15.562]  You don't pay your poison water bill, they take your home away.
[00:55:16.122 --> 00:55:23.705]  You make a home ec ingredients for your chickweed, for your psoriasis, you get 48 years in jail.
[00:55:23.925 --> 00:55:24.625]  Go ahead, Pete.
[00:55:25.845 --> 00:55:27.586]  I was just going to say, I don't know.
[00:55:27.606 --> 00:55:35.028]  I mean, this might be reading into the situation a little too deep, but I honestly think Flint, Michigan is just a beta test.
[00:55:35.649 --> 00:55:40.594]  I mean, if you look around all over the country, everywhere else, there's people rioting, burning stuff down.
[00:55:41.034 --> 00:55:50.102]  Thankfully, it's not going on in my hometown of Flint, Michigan, but I think there's a little bit more to the water that they're not really opening up to the public.
[00:55:50.923 --> 00:56:01.373]  It's just, I mean, if that was me and my family in that situation, and the water bills are continuing to go sky high because nobody else in Flint is just wanting to pay the bill,
[00:56:02.034 --> 00:56:03.335]  I mean, you can't take a shower.
[00:56:03.535 --> 00:56:04.315]  You can't drink.
[00:56:04.595 --> 00:56:06.056]  I mean, you can't do anything.
[00:56:06.076 --> 00:56:09.938]  I mean, it's the freaking water for crying out loud.
[00:56:10.018 --> 00:56:11.158]  It's not just the lead.
[00:56:11.338 --> 00:56:20.723]  People were being advised not to take hot showers with the steam with children because they would get Legionnaire's disease from breathing in the steam of the hot water.
[00:56:20.743 --> 00:56:27.286]  They're saying take cold showers or leave a window open to ventilate the room.
[00:56:27.866 --> 00:56:30.127]  You shouldn't have to do that when taking a shower in America.
[00:56:30.993 --> 00:56:31.253]  No.
[00:56:31.593 --> 00:56:32.434]  No, it's crazy.
[00:56:32.634 --> 00:56:33.234]  It's crazy.
[00:56:34.835 --> 00:56:36.175]  I totally hear you there, man.
[00:56:36.515 --> 00:56:40.837]  So I'm glad you're out of that situation, because that is disgusting what's going on in Flint.
[00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:43.298]  And notice it's a Democratic administration.
[00:56:43.338 --> 00:56:45.399]  They just can't figure out how to clean the water.
[00:56:46.159 --> 00:56:49.060]  And they know they have the abilities to do this.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.981]  There's water treatment plants all over
[00:56:51.823 --> 00:56:53.784]  The United States, they're going to have to put in some better equipment.
[00:56:53.824 --> 00:57:04.549]  It's like everyone involved with that entire thing was crooked to some degree, whether it was the, I believe, Republican state government, the Democrats on the local level, everyone who had their hands in this.
[00:57:05.369 --> 00:57:09.131]  It comes down to they don't care about the poor people of Flint, Michigan.
[00:57:09.616 --> 00:57:18.582]  You know, this is a city where, because of NAFTA and other things like that, and the bad trade deals that the President is talking about, you know, fixing, all the automakers just got up and left.
[00:57:18.942 --> 00:57:25.146]  When we were driving around Flint, you just see these big pads that are probably a couple square miles of where the factories used to be.
[00:57:25.166 --> 00:57:27.347]  And it's just concrete, as far as you can see.
[00:57:27.367 --> 00:57:29.249]  And it's where the buildings used to stand.
[00:57:29.409 --> 00:57:32.330]  And all these cars used to be made, people used to be employed there.
[00:57:33.666 --> 00:57:35.147]  And these have worked their way up there, too.
[00:57:35.227 --> 00:57:54.341]  I used to make commercials for car dealerships around here, and one of the guys who owns several car dealerships, I mean, he was like a king in this world, he started in Flint, Michigan at a, I think, a Ford plant on the line, you know, putting together cars and worked his way up through their system and, you know, now has several houses.
[00:57:54.381 --> 00:57:58.164]  Well, it was a career, and, you know, people were pretty well paid to do these jobs, and
[00:57:59.028 --> 00:58:00.629]  The people just end up leaving the town.
[00:58:01.189 --> 00:58:04.391]  Did you have any family or did you personally work in the auto industry?
[00:58:06.292 --> 00:58:13.616]  I was actually a Genesee County Sheriff's Officer right in the heart of Flint, Michigan for seven years.
[00:58:16.517 --> 00:58:21.320]  Recently just got out of that line of work two years ago and I'm now working for a
[00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:23.831]  We're a great company called Edustaff.
[00:58:23.851 --> 00:58:25.212]  We supply substitute teachers.
[00:58:25.233 --> 00:58:28.455]  I'm up in front of people, talking in front of people, which is what I love.
[00:58:28.515 --> 00:58:39.524]  I go to my home church, still in Flint, and trying to wake up everybody as much as I can, due to, thankfully, for the great listening every day that I get from you guys.
[00:58:39.864 --> 00:58:40.665]  That's excellent, Pete.
[00:58:41.186 --> 00:58:42.107]  Absolutely do what you love.
[00:58:42.447 --> 00:58:51.517]  And I tell you what, go to our website, Infowarsstore.com, those of you out there who need a water filter system, and you can read the percentages of what these filters do.
[00:58:51.577 --> 00:58:55.401]  They take out fluoride, they take out lead, they take out arsenic, they take out benzene.
[00:58:55.882 --> 00:58:57.444]  Just go check out the test.
[00:58:57.584 --> 00:58:58.925]  They're third-party certified.
[00:59:00.587 --> 00:59:02.508]  These other medical labs are not associated with us.
[00:59:02.568 --> 00:59:03.548]  We sent them the filters.
[00:59:03.588 --> 00:59:08.270]  Actually, these things were tested before we even started selling them and got all these certifications.
[00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:14.292]  But go to InfoWarsStore.com and check out the ProPure and Alexa Pure water filter system.
[00:59:14.332 --> 00:59:17.294]  ProPure is actually only about an hour away from Flint.
[00:59:17.314 --> 00:59:26.517]  When we went to cover the whole water thing there, we stopped there first to ask them some questions about water filtration and how people can eliminate these heavy metals and such from their water.
[00:59:28.618 --> 00:59:30.619]  You know, their warehouse is there and they showed us around.
[00:59:30.639 --> 00:59:36.061]  So absolutely, you need to be filtering your water even if you live in a city that doesn't have poison in the tap water.
[00:59:36.221 --> 00:59:38.802]  Because they've got fluoride, chlorine.
[00:59:38.822 --> 00:59:39.902]  There's plenty of other poisons.
[00:59:39.922 --> 00:59:41.342]  All the other chemicals and poisons.
[00:59:41.382 --> 00:59:48.305]  The pharmaceutical drugs that come back into your water, they're finding pharmaceutical drugs in the waste water that comes out.
[00:59:49.005 --> 00:59:54.067]  Well, how do you know it's not coming back in through the, because they're not really filtering your water, they put it through like a sand filter.
[00:59:54.867 --> 01:00:00.390]  I mean, it's a big sand filter, about 7 feet tall, but that's what they're filtering your water through is sand.
[01:00:01.011 --> 01:00:03.652]  And that's after, they filter it after they put the chlorine in the chloride.
[01:00:03.672 --> 01:00:07.414]  Well, they're proud that they meet the minimum federal requirements for what they can actually have you drink.
[01:00:07.594 --> 01:00:07.955]  Sure.
[01:00:08.015 --> 01:00:09.616]  We met the acceptable minimums.
[01:00:09.656 --> 01:00:13.278]  Hey, you know, compared to the rest of the world, we have decent water.
[01:00:13.298 --> 01:00:13.658]  Oh right, sure.
[01:00:13.678 --> 01:00:15.019]  But it could be better.
[01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:17.860]  I wouldn't have had the tap water while we were in Haiti, for sure.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.182]  I'll brush my teeth with the tap water here in Austin.
[01:00:21.107 --> 01:00:23.169]  Harrison, you got another article you said, you had a couple.
[01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:32.217]  Well yeah, and this sort of relates back to the last article and I got two articles and a video and they all sort of tell a nice little story that I'll try to keep straight.
[01:00:32.257 --> 01:00:37.362]  I decided to save the first time I'd ever come on live with y'all after I'd been up all night.
[01:00:37.402 --> 01:00:38.883]  Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[01:00:40.302 --> 01:00:44.749]  Chugging along here on several capsules of Brain Force Plus.
[01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:49.517]  Okay, so the first one, gay birds, we've covered that.
[01:00:50.037 --> 01:00:54.624]  And one of the things that, you know, people laugh at this and think it's funny that the birds are turning gay.
[01:00:56.633 --> 01:01:01.174]  But then there's other stuff that is just a little bit more insidious.
[01:01:02.414 --> 01:01:03.515]  So this is Caltech.
[01:01:03.555 --> 01:01:06.996]  It's testosterone makes men less likely to question their impulses.
[01:01:08.156 --> 01:01:11.017]  So that means the lower your testosterone... Oh, okay.
[01:01:11.437 --> 01:01:11.697]  Yeah.
[01:01:11.957 --> 01:01:12.537]  That's interesting.
[01:01:12.557 --> 01:01:13.857]  They don't say that in the article.
[01:01:13.897 --> 01:01:15.178]  They say testosterone.
[01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:17.398]  So you're like, I better stop taking testosterone.
[01:01:17.658 --> 01:01:17.838]  Right.
[01:01:17.858 --> 01:01:18.558]  It's close to my gut.
[01:01:19.079 --> 01:01:19.299]  Right.
[01:01:19.319 --> 01:01:19.899]  So this is, yeah.
[01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:25.402]  Right, you're more likely to just go with your gut instinct, the higher your testosterone is.
[01:01:25.822 --> 01:01:35.328]  And of course, as we know, the stuff in the water, the different GMO foods that have estrogen, that type of stuff, we're constantly... Bisphenol A, estrogen mimicker.
[01:01:35.668 --> 01:01:40.271]  Right, being limited on our testosterone, which makes you less likely to go with your gut.
[01:01:40.491 --> 01:01:44.854]  And I think everybody knows from experience that usually your gut instinct
[01:01:45.454 --> 01:01:57.107]  Alright, and I guess we're going to have Lionel coming up too.
[01:01:57.147 --> 01:02:02.694]  Let's start getting him on the line and we'll bring him in and do a plug and everything when we get back from this video.
[01:02:03.801 --> 01:02:13.851]  I once, you know I'm a magician, and I got interested in mind reading and fortune telling, fake fortune telling, you know?
[01:02:14.311 --> 01:02:19.476]  And I got to know a lot of old fakes who had retired as millionaires, you know?
[01:02:19.917 --> 01:02:22.839]  And they told me their secrets, how you do it.
[01:02:22.879 --> 01:02:24.581]  They have things that are called cold readings.
[01:02:25.362 --> 01:02:25.862]  Oh, what's that?
[01:02:25.902 --> 01:02:27.424]  A cold reading is you warm up
[01:02:28.359 --> 01:02:28.879]  The sucker.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.901]  By telling him things that he says, how could he ever know that, you see?
[01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:41.044]  You say, you know, between the ages of 13 and 15, you had a great change came in your life.
[01:02:41.064 --> 01:02:43.846]  But that happens in everybody's life.
[01:02:44.286 --> 01:02:47.067]  But he says, he came in and told me things I already see.
[01:02:47.087 --> 01:02:48.348]  You've got a scar on your knee.
[01:02:48.408 --> 01:02:50.368]  Everybody fell down and has a scar on their knee.
[01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:52.069]  Those are cold readings, you see?
[01:02:52.089 --> 01:02:54.090]  Now... I have a scar on my knee.
[01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:54.930]  How did you know that?
[01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.691]  Yeah, you see?
[01:02:56.758 --> 01:02:58.419]  Just something bigger than myself.
[01:02:58.539 --> 01:03:06.821]  Well, now, the point about this is that after they're warmed up, they're amazed by this knee bit and the rest of it, they start telling you.
[01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:08.962]  Because you just say, is this it?
[01:03:08.982 --> 01:03:10.622]  And you see from their face it is or it isn't.
[01:03:10.642 --> 01:03:12.523]  And then you tell it back and they say, how did he do it?
[01:03:12.563 --> 01:03:12.883]  You see?
[01:03:13.303 --> 01:03:13.943]  So I was bored.
[01:03:14.003 --> 01:03:24.847]  I was playing in Kansas City with Catherine Cornell one time and we didn't have any matinee on Wednesday, so I hired a room and put Dr. Swami fortune teller, you know?
[01:03:26.028 --> 01:03:26.968]  Two dollar readings.
[01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:34.895]  And for the whole day, they came in, and I... Each one... Because I felt guilty about it, at the end, I said, I'm not going to take your money.
[01:03:35.475 --> 01:03:38.818]  You know, because I couldn't have really taken... For a whole day, I was a fortune teller.
[01:03:39.178 --> 01:03:39.599]  Faking.
[01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:48.746]  But then, there began to happen to me the thing that does happen to fortune tellers, and which is the occupational disease of fraudulent fortune tellers.
[01:03:49.127 --> 01:03:50.608]  And they have a name for it.
[01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:54.251]  It's called becoming a shut-eye.
[01:03:55.990 --> 01:04:01.617]  And a shut eye in the argo of these crooks is the fellow who begins to believe himself.
[01:04:04.525 --> 01:04:06.206]  You see, and you make these wild guesses.
[01:04:06.266 --> 01:04:22.037]  One of them explained to me, he says, supposing you're a night clerk in a hotel, and when you get the job, first of all, a fella comes in, wants a single room, you look at how good his luggage is, how good are his shoes, and you tell him, there's a room on the court, there's no room, or, yes sir, depending on various pieces of evidence.
[01:04:22.057 --> 01:04:25.880]  He says, you've been a night clerk long enough, you glance, and you tell him.
[01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:30.183]  You've been a night clerk a little longer, and you don't have to look.
[01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:39.224]  You've seen it, but the computer in here has made all of those deductions without you being conscious of it.
[01:04:40.569 --> 01:04:45.531]  So, the mind reader gets so that he, without thinking, does that, and then they say it's true.
[01:04:45.951 --> 01:04:57.777]  And a woman came in to me at the end of my career as a fraudulent fortune teller, in a bright print dress, sat down, looking perfectly all right, and I said, you've lost your husband last week.
[01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:00.458]  And she burst into tears, she had.
[01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:01.618]  And then I quit.
[01:05:01.638 --> 01:05:05.140]  That was terrible.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.481]  Yes, it's one of those things, undoubtedly,
[01:05:08.453 --> 01:05:09.314]  It's not psychic.
[01:05:09.454 --> 01:05:12.136]  Undoubtedly, there was evidence of a tragedy.
[01:05:12.176 --> 01:05:15.399]  There was all kinds of things that went into the computer and got processed.
[01:05:16.451 --> 01:05:19.352]  Without me crookedly thinking what I'm going to say to her.
[01:05:19.392 --> 01:05:20.593]  And that's how it works, I think.
[01:05:21.013 --> 01:05:21.933]  That's fascinating.
[01:05:21.953 --> 01:05:22.373]  Isn't it funny?
[01:05:22.453 --> 01:05:25.514]  And you get sort of five spooky premonitions a year.
[01:05:25.534 --> 01:05:27.095]  Like that, and then, you know, yes I do.
[01:05:27.155 --> 01:05:30.396]  And I'm sure they're all spooky like that in some kind of funny way.
[01:05:30.416 --> 01:05:36.979]  I suppose I looked at Una and said, you know, she's just, Una's exactly the girl that would be happy with Charlie, I suppose.
[01:05:37.819 --> 01:05:40.860]  And instead of thinking, maybe you'll meet him, I just, what did I lose?
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.901]  I said, you're going to marry him.
[01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:42.741]  And she did.
[01:05:44.622 --> 01:05:45.923]  Psychic Orson Welles!
[01:05:46.783 --> 01:05:51.205]  And so I guess that illustrates that he was going with his gut and he's a man of high testosterone, is that what you're illustrating?
[01:05:51.225 --> 01:06:07.311]  Well, it's the idea that, you know, even just after, you know, 12 hours of just pretending to read people's minds, you know, the fact is our brains are antenna and we are constantly putting out and absorbing information that we do not consciously
[01:06:08.672 --> 01:06:08.932]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:24.335 --> 01:06:30.581]  That is our gut instinct and we are able to take in a lot of information that we don't process consciously.
[01:06:30.621 --> 01:06:35.245]  And so, then when you have your testosterone, it makes you less likely to go with your gut instinct.
[01:06:35.505 --> 01:06:39.589]  It's disconnecting you from this psychic energy that is constantly around us.
[01:06:39.669 --> 01:06:43.972]  And saying psychic energy might make, you know, turn people off.
[01:06:44.693 --> 01:06:45.873]  You know, call it whatever you want.
[01:06:46.073 --> 01:06:47.674]  It's the little signals that we're seeing.
[01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:52.495]  It's the, whether it's electricity or just visual or audio cues.
[01:06:52.535 --> 01:06:58.417]  I mean, it's all this sort of stuff that we're being disconnected from by the poisoning in our water.
[01:06:58.457 --> 01:07:00.998]  The same stuff that makes the frogs gay.
[01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:02.058]  Birds.
[01:07:02.338 --> 01:07:10.461]  Yeah, it's limiting our connection to each other, our connection to humanity as a whole, our ability to understand things on an instinctual level.
[01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:13.682]  Well, it's things like fluoride that make people docile.
[01:07:14.502 --> 01:07:14.722]  Yeah.
[01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:21.328]  You know, it makes people, you know, just okay with doing their daily little routine, not ask questions or anything like that.
[01:07:22.149 --> 01:07:23.450]  You know, it makes you subservient.
[01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:24.270]  It makes you a slave.
[01:07:24.751 --> 01:07:31.036]  When I see stories like this next one, it makes me go, this is why I don't take public transportation and avoid it.
[01:07:31.176 --> 01:07:33.158]  Because this is what's in store for you.
[01:07:34.179 --> 01:07:40.124]  When you're in the public transportation system, you are up, you are at the mercy of the people who run it.
[01:07:40.384 --> 01:07:41.826]  And if they don't decide to do their job,
[01:07:43.018 --> 01:07:47.601]  Or if there's an accident and you're in that infrastructure, well, you know, there could be a crash, any of these things.
[01:07:47.641 --> 01:07:48.941]  Of course there's crashes on cars.
[01:07:49.282 --> 01:07:49.882]  Terrorism.
[01:07:50.562 --> 01:07:54.845]  But here we have water, possibly sewage, seeps from Penn Station ceiling during morning commute.
[01:07:55.385 --> 01:07:58.627]  That don't smell like rainwater, a commuter passing by the leak said.
[01:07:58.647 --> 01:08:03.710]  Though it is New York City, which has kind of an odor to it all the time.
[01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:07.163]  It does, especially if you go near the alleyways.
[01:08:07.243 --> 01:08:08.643]  Penn Station commuters can't catch a break.
[01:08:08.663 --> 01:08:16.408]  Today, New Jerseyans and Long Islanders on their way to work retreated to a lovely site which appears to be sewage water seeping and later gushing from a station ceiling.
[01:08:17.165 --> 01:08:24.171]  The leak appeared to be concentrated near track 19, what served the Babylon line this morning, according to witnesses.
[01:08:25.632 --> 01:08:28.654]  As one commuter put it, that don't smell like rainwater.
[01:08:28.794 --> 01:08:30.175]  Oh, and we got video.
[01:08:30.255 --> 01:08:31.616]  Nice video here of the sewage.
[01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:32.377]  Look at that.
[01:08:32.397 --> 01:08:34.138]  Oh, we're going to put these trash cans here.
[01:08:34.219 --> 01:08:34.939]  That will fix it.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:36.821]  Don't worry about the leak.
[01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:38.790]  I mean, I guess they can't.
[01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:42.071]  There's probably so many pipes running through New York at this point.
[01:08:42.211 --> 01:08:43.031]  It's crazy.
[01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:48.193]  But speaking of psychic power and brains, let's go to Joshua in Wyoming.
[01:08:48.213 --> 01:08:49.593]  He wants to talk about brain force.
[01:08:50.133 --> 01:08:50.913]  Go ahead, Joshua.
[01:08:50.953 --> 01:08:51.393]  Are you there?
[01:08:55.114 --> 01:08:56.215]  Hey, buddy.
[01:08:56.235 --> 01:09:00.856]  Turn this off speaker if you can.
[01:09:00.876 --> 01:09:04.477]  Sorry, I meant to call from...
[01:09:08.363 --> 01:09:09.744]  Don't worry about it, it's okay.
[01:09:09.764 --> 01:09:10.504]  What was on your mind?
[01:09:10.524 --> 01:09:20.549]  I wanted to call about the gay men because it helps me go through school, which I'm currently at.
[01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:28.453]  And it actually helped me think to pass away through a comical baloney.
[01:09:29.354 --> 01:09:31.595]  What grade are you in?
[01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:31.915]  Seventh.
[01:09:32.595 --> 01:09:33.356]  Seventh grade.
[01:09:35.141 --> 01:09:39.945]  I hope you're using earbuds because you should not be putting a cell phone up to your head at that young of age.
[01:09:39.965 --> 01:09:41.106]  Your brain is still developing.
[01:09:42.347 --> 01:09:42.647]  Yeah.
[01:09:43.308 --> 01:09:44.168]  But I'm not a doctor.
[01:09:44.188 --> 01:09:45.109]  Don't take my advice.
[01:09:45.469 --> 01:09:47.071]  You're just a dad who has a 7th grader.
[01:09:47.831 --> 01:09:51.074]  Yeah, I'm a dad who has a 7th grader and he's not allowed to take a phone to school.
[01:09:52.375 --> 01:10:01.182]  But, when he does use the phone for doing conversations and stuff with the grandparents, he has to use an earbud or put it on speaker.
[01:10:03.419 --> 01:10:04.740]  So, what else is on your mind?
[01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.582]  How's the indoctrination going?
[01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:18.851]  Actually, just recently my dad, for not having the first sips, so my dad doesn't let me have no vaccinations anymore.
[01:10:21.252 --> 01:10:21.553]  Really?
[01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:24.315]  Are they making you get it to go to school?
[01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:32.881]  In fifth grade they told me to take, I forgot what type of vaccine it was, it was like tetanus.
[01:10:33.823 --> 01:10:44.772]  They told me to take it, so I wouldn't be homeschooled if I didn't take it.
[01:10:45.973 --> 01:10:46.253]  Wow.
[01:10:46.694 --> 01:10:48.595]  Yeah, the tetanus shot actually has mercury in it.
[01:10:49.176 --> 01:10:50.537]  It's one of the little things they don't tell you.
[01:10:51.378 --> 01:10:52.999]  Got a lot of mercury in that tetanus shot.
[01:10:53.239 --> 01:10:54.260]  That's why you gotta read the insert.
[01:10:56.082 --> 01:10:57.523]  Yeah.
[01:10:58.003 --> 01:11:00.045]  I told my friends about the inserts, too, actually.
[01:11:00.922 --> 01:11:01.803]  Yeah, they're fun to read.
[01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:04.884]  You should get them out during school and show everybody what's in them.
[01:11:04.924 --> 01:11:06.245]  Especially that HPV shot.
[01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:07.586]  Oh, yeah.
[01:11:07.666 --> 01:11:10.267]  Well, they want to push that on all girls who are 13 or so.
[01:11:10.547 --> 01:11:10.788]  Yeah.
[01:11:11.028 --> 01:11:13.789]  Read about all the... Well, they want to push it on boys, too.
[01:11:14.009 --> 01:11:15.310]  There's HPV for boys.
[01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:16.731]  They want to give it to everybody.
[01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:19.513]  Because there's just not enough seizures in this world.
[01:11:20.253 --> 01:11:24.535]  Hey, Joshua, anything else before we let you go and get back to your school day?
[01:11:24.675 --> 01:11:25.916]  My friend would like to talk to me.
[01:11:25.956 --> 01:11:26.857]  He's not here right now.
[01:11:30.305 --> 01:11:30.925]  Well, excellent.
[01:11:30.945 --> 01:11:34.727]  Well, thanks for listening to us and keep up, you know, keep up the good work.
[01:11:34.747 --> 01:11:37.808]  Keep your grades up, you know, to survive in the system.
[01:11:37.828 --> 01:11:39.489]  But also think for yourself, brother.
[01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:40.209]  Think for yourself.
[01:11:40.249 --> 01:11:40.749]  Have a good one.
[01:11:40.849 --> 01:11:41.530]  Thanks for calling.
[01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:44.751]  Let's go to this last caller and that'll clear out the board.
[01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:46.172]  This is Eugene in Ohio.
[01:11:46.712 --> 01:11:48.713]  Let's talk about Trump's first 100 days.
[01:11:48.813 --> 01:11:49.533]  Go ahead, Eugene.
[01:11:49.553 --> 01:11:50.413]  How are you doing this morning?
[01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:52.494]  I am great.
[01:11:53.034 --> 01:11:54.755]  First time caller, long time listener.
[01:11:54.775 --> 01:11:58.977]  Been trying to get through to you guys for like forever, but it's impossible to get through to you.
[01:11:59.591 --> 01:12:00.832]  Hey, earlier bird gets the worm.
[01:12:00.972 --> 01:12:01.473]  That's right.
[01:12:01.913 --> 01:12:02.634]  You're up early with us.
[01:12:02.654 --> 01:12:03.895]  How are you listening to us this morning?
[01:12:05.456 --> 01:12:07.958]  Through my iPhone app, the old app.
[01:12:08.518 --> 01:12:10.900]  Wow.
[01:12:12.141 --> 01:12:16.705]  I wanted to talk to you guys about like a thousand things, but I think there's probably very little time.
[01:12:16.885 --> 01:12:17.826]  Well, just pick one or two.
[01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:25.212]  Well, all these GMOs and all these vaccines, they're maiming people.
[01:12:25.632 --> 01:12:27.434]  How many people are getting autism?
[01:12:27.904 --> 01:12:32.807]  That would be interesting if he tried to pull that off.
[01:12:32.827 --> 01:12:35.288]  There would be a lot of pushback.
[01:12:49.486 --> 01:12:57.292]  And I don't know if he can, if the country is ready to accept that type of edict from the president.
[01:12:57.613 --> 01:12:59.894]  Although it would be interesting to see if he came out with that.
[01:12:59.935 --> 01:13:04.178]  I would love to see the reaction of the press as they go to defend their sponsors.
[01:13:04.358 --> 01:13:04.959]  What were you saying?
[01:13:04.979 --> 01:13:06.340]  What was the move?
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.461]  The art of the deal move?
[01:13:07.641 --> 01:13:08.642]  Where you go big?
[01:13:08.682 --> 01:13:10.424]  What's the big ask?
[01:13:10.464 --> 01:13:11.464]  That would be a big ask.
[01:13:12.668 --> 01:13:17.050]  I wanted to give one constructive criticism about your product that's been bugging me for a long time.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.181]  I love your products.
[01:13:41.361 --> 01:13:42.161]  I know they're great.
[01:13:42.241 --> 01:13:49.905]  I've been researching nutritional stuff, natural cures for incurable diseases for a long time, and I was concerned.
[01:13:50.385 --> 01:14:07.373]  I know Alex Jones talked a little bit about the dangers of soy, but all your tinctures, I think, are soy-free, but I was a little annoyed that your bottled, your capsule products, either the capsule or something in it, you have soy.
[01:14:08.266 --> 01:14:09.387]  I can answer that one for you.
[01:14:09.727 --> 01:14:15.051]  So that's going to be the capsule itself, and the reason it's made out of soy is because they're vegan.
[01:14:15.091 --> 01:14:20.836]  So the soy is vegan, whereas traditional gelatin capsules for pills are not.
[01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:31.604]  So if you make gelatin capsules, and actually you'll find almost all supplement manufacturers do this, they use soy capsules, but the amount you're getting in one of those is not like if you're eating a brick of tofu or something like that.
[01:14:31.644 --> 01:14:35.848]  So the amount of estrogen mimickers or anything of that nature would be extremely low.
[01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:38.449]  You know what, though?
[01:14:38.469 --> 01:14:39.270]  You could do what I do.
[01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:41.751]  You know what I do when I make my little yoda juice?
[01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.933]  I open the capsule and dump it in.
[01:14:44.433 --> 01:14:47.775]  And then I don't have the gelatin soy, or whatever you want to call it.
[01:14:48.616 --> 01:14:51.077]  So that's how you can bypass it.
[01:14:51.097 --> 01:14:52.978]  But to answer your question, that's why it's in there.
[01:14:53.018 --> 01:14:55.160]  So there's very small amounts of it.
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:56.281]  You can thank the vegans.
[01:14:56.601 --> 01:14:57.481]  It's because of the vegans.
[01:14:57.581 --> 01:15:03.185]  I'd be totally fine with the traditional gelatin made out of horse... Grind up cow bones.
[01:15:03.245 --> 01:15:04.386]  Cow bones, whatever it may be.
[01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:06.730]  All right, Eugene, anything else?
[01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:15.172]  Yes, I saw some of your capsule products, they don't contain soy and the only reason I bring it up is because I'm extremely allergic to soy.
[01:15:15.192 --> 01:15:20.413]  Soy is giving me seizures and all kinds of neurological problems and aggravating.
[01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:24.413]  I don't know if I have a vaccine injury or what or it's related.
[01:15:24.533 --> 01:15:33.515]  I have leaky gut, I have candida, SIBO, lots of rare complications that are difficult to treat with each other and
[01:15:34.013 --> 01:15:39.096]  The soy, a lot of people, you know, I think soy is as dangerous as wheat.
[01:15:39.156 --> 01:15:40.837]  I know your products are gluten-free.
[01:15:41.317 --> 01:15:50.123]  I think you should put a little circle on your products, also staying soy-free, and I think a lot of people would appreciate that and would increase their sales.
[01:15:50.403 --> 01:15:59.228]  A lot of people are becoming allergic to soy, too, because they put soy in the vaccines and a lot of other reasons why people are becoming allergic to it.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:11.047]  Well that is true, and I will ask Dr. Group, because I think some of our capsules are made in different facilities, so I think that's why some of them are made out of soy and some of them aren't, but I'll bring that question up.
[01:16:11.087 --> 01:16:12.227]  Thank you for calling, Eugene.
[01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:14.569]  That is pretty thought-provoking.
[01:16:14.609 --> 01:16:20.732]  Hope you do well, and let us know how things are going with your, you know, when you're taking the InfoWars Life products.
[01:16:20.752 --> 01:16:22.974]  You seem to like them, so I'm glad they're helping you out.
[01:16:24.374 --> 01:16:30.117]  Guys, we're going to go to a quick break, but as we do that, I want to remind you of all the specials we have going.
[01:16:30.137 --> 01:16:35.600]  You've heard people calling in and providing testimonials for the products, and we're not even asking for them to do that.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:41.083]  It's funny how this happens, and if I didn't see all the behind the scenes, I would think, oh, they have people call in.
[01:16:41.403 --> 01:16:43.024]  We don't have time to set that up.
[01:16:43.204 --> 01:16:44.165]  No, we certainly don't.
[01:16:44.185 --> 01:16:47.206]  We barely have time to put everything together production-wise.
[01:16:47.927 --> 01:16:52.329]  It's incredible how many responses and feedback we get from people.
[01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:58.073]  Almost every caller has taken the products and just has rave reviews about them.
[01:16:58.553 --> 01:17:02.956]  Well, let me read one of these BrainForce reviews, which is now 30% off if you go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:17:03.736 --> 01:17:06.137]  This is from Greg from an undisclosed location.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:24.148]  Already my brain fog had lifted thanks to Survival Shield X2, but it was BrainForce that gave me the mental stamina to represent myself and save my home.
[01:17:24.529 --> 01:17:25.490]  Thanks BrainForce!
[01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:29.374]  And he puts an exclamation point after that and he gave it a five star rating.
[01:17:30.375 --> 01:17:32.397]  And we just took our BrainForce before the show.
[01:17:32.638 --> 01:17:36.402]  I am fully alert now for having a hour, hour and a half of sleep last night.
[01:17:36.622 --> 01:17:37.143]  Exactly.
[01:17:37.843 --> 01:17:43.310]  And we gotta keep going through the rest of the day because we're not ending until 5, 6, 7, 8 o'clock maybe?
[01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.770]  I don't know.
[01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:44.611]  It's gonna go on.
[01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:46.033]  You might get another 12 hours of this.
[01:17:46.613 --> 01:17:47.274]  So stay tuned.
[01:17:47.294 --> 01:17:49.416]  Infowars.com forward slash show is the free link.
[01:17:49.617 --> 01:17:50.498]  Spread that link.
[01:17:51.118 --> 01:17:51.899]  Spread it around.
[01:17:51.939 --> 01:17:52.700]  It's the free stream.
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:54.302]  We also have our YouTube stream there.
[01:17:54.562 --> 01:18:05.568]  So we got 30% off Brain Force, 20% off Secret 12, 20% off Knockout, 20% off Winter Sun, 20% off Prostagard, Bio PCA, Biome Defense, and Living Defense, all 20% off.
[01:18:05.888 --> 01:18:13.412]  And DNA Force is back in stock, a very popular product, one of our more higher-end products that people really like.
[01:18:13.452 --> 01:18:15.553]  It's going to sell out again too, very quickly.
[01:18:15.673 --> 01:18:21.696]  I had this little twitch in my eye a few, it was a few months ago, and I'm like, I gotta start taking my DNA Force again.
[01:18:21.716 --> 01:18:23.237]  I'm gonna take it solid for two weeks.
[01:18:24.281 --> 01:18:25.041]  I have no idea what to ask.
[01:18:50.776 --> 01:18:51.637]  Well thank you for calling.
[01:18:51.737 --> 01:18:52.618]  Thanks for calling, brother.
[01:18:52.638 --> 01:18:53.219]  Spread the word.
[01:18:53.239 --> 01:18:53.880]  Appreciate it.
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:56.042]  And we're gonna go to a quick break and we'll be back.
[01:18:56.082 --> 01:18:57.644]  Hopefully we'll have Lionel on the line.
[01:18:57.684 --> 01:19:01.468]  He is scheduled to be on today and I would love to hear his voice this morning.
[01:19:01.488 --> 01:19:02.490]  I think it'll wake us up!
[01:19:03.137 --> 01:19:04.858]  He has an incredible amount of energy.
[01:19:04.978 --> 01:19:05.759]  I agree!
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.680]  That's my Lionel impression.
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:08.181]  Love the guy.
[01:19:08.201 --> 01:19:08.501]  He's great.
[01:19:08.521 --> 01:19:09.402]  He's got a lot of energy.
[01:19:09.462 --> 01:19:12.224]  So hopefully we're going to patch him through in just a bit.
[01:19:12.344 --> 01:19:14.565]  On the other side of this break, thanks for watching InfoWars.com.
[01:19:14.905 --> 01:19:21.150]  Forward slash show is where you can send your friends, neighbors, countrymen to listen to what we're doing now.
[01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:24.733]  30 hours in defense of free speech because we're under attack.
[01:19:24.773 --> 01:19:27.234]  And if we're under attack, you're going to be under attack next.
[01:19:27.254 --> 01:19:28.715]  So thanks for watching and spread that link.
[01:19:29.036 --> 01:19:31.557]  And go to InfoWarsStore.com and check out some of the great deals we have.
[01:19:31.597 --> 01:19:32.218]  Thanks for watching.
[01:19:43.089 --> 01:19:44.971]  I joke around a lot on the air.
[01:19:45.131 --> 01:19:46.052]  I try to have a good time.
[01:19:46.672 --> 01:19:47.833]  I'm a happy person overall.
[01:19:48.714 --> 01:19:56.281]  But I have intellectually studied the globalist program and I understand it is a major threat to myself and my family and your family as well.
[01:19:57.281 --> 01:20:02.026]  Now we do have some gallows humor around here, but when you get down to the bedrock of our message, it's dire.
[01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:05.869]  Globalism is an anti-human system.
[01:20:06.129 --> 01:20:07.510]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[01:20:08.567 --> 01:20:19.631]  The elites believe humanity's finished and are basically stealing our wealth, our intellectual property, and our very essence to construct their new world order system.
[01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:24.273]  Now I never started InfoWars 22 years ago believing I would save the world.
[01:20:24.533 --> 01:20:25.934]  I just wanted to be a watchman on the wall
[01:20:27.219 --> 01:20:34.604]  A modern Paul Revere who could warn people about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[01:20:35.244 --> 01:20:40.428]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[01:20:41.008 --> 01:20:50.595]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[01:20:51.235 --> 01:20:58.479]  Wednesday, May 3rd and Thursday, May 4th, we're doing a 30-hour transmission that kicked off at 11 a.m.
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:20:59.380]  on Wednesday.
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:05.103]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[01:21:05.804 --> 01:21:11.227]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[01:21:11.849 --> 01:21:23.297]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show, or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news, but have not actually heard the message.
[01:21:24.098 --> 01:21:26.299]  Tell people, this is the forbidden message.
[01:21:26.619 --> 01:21:28.261]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[01:21:28.281 --> 01:21:30.722]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[01:21:31.123 --> 01:21:36.086]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host character.
[01:21:36.346 --> 01:21:41.190]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society, goodwill.
[01:21:42.165 --> 01:21:44.546]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[01:21:44.967 --> 01:21:48.709]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[01:21:48.749 --> 01:21:49.289]  That's the goal.
[01:21:49.429 --> 01:21:51.530]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:51.831]  No.
[01:21:52.271 --> 01:21:57.854]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[01:21:58.334 --> 01:22:02.317]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[01:22:03.177 --> 01:22:03.257]  Yes.
[01:22:18.114 --> 01:22:20.956]  And also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[01:22:21.297 --> 01:22:31.685]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[01:22:32.185 --> 01:22:46.777]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high-quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[01:22:47.217 --> 01:22:51.898]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[01:22:52.199 --> 01:22:57.640]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private-labeled at lower prices.
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:59.341]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[01:22:59.601 --> 01:23:05.843]  And many of which I've developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers, like Knockout, our amazing sleep aid.
[01:23:06.243 --> 01:23:16.446]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[01:23:16.926 --> 01:23:19.488]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[01:23:19.968 --> 01:23:22.950]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:29.875]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[01:23:31.076 --> 01:23:35.959]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.181]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[01:23:38.241 --> 01:23:39.061]  They see the lies.
[01:23:39.402 --> 01:23:40.482]  They see the demonization.
[01:23:41.263 --> 01:23:45.286]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic at InfoWars.com.
[01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:55.529]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[01:23:55.909 --> 01:24:06.898]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[01:24:07.319 --> 01:24:12.483]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:24:13.724 --> 01:24:13.904]  I think?
[01:24:34.065 --> 01:24:35.945]  We have Secret 12 at 20% off.
[01:24:36.306 --> 01:24:39.146]  We have Living Defense, a parasite cleanse, 20% off.
[01:24:39.426 --> 01:24:42.327]  Biome Defense, our great probiotic, 25% off.
[01:24:42.727 --> 01:24:45.668]  Bio PCA for skin and nails, top formula.
[01:24:45.968 --> 01:24:49.648]  Other formulas that are similar cost 60, 70 bucks, two, three times what ours does.
[01:24:49.948 --> 01:24:51.789]  Prostagard, incredible formula.
[01:24:52.249 --> 01:24:56.250]  Winter Sun, the knockout that I mentioned, and so many other great products.
[01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.930]  And then finally,
[01:24:57.090 --> 01:24:57.870]  Let me see if it's still here.
[01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.270]  It is.
[01:24:58.651 --> 01:25:01.151]  This just came back in after two months being sold out.
[01:25:01.571 --> 01:25:04.833]  Super blue, high-quality, organic toothpaste.
[01:25:05.573 --> 01:25:10.575]  Fluoride-free, with iodine, with colloidal silver, with tea tree oil and peppermint oil.
[01:25:10.935 --> 01:25:11.815]  It's concentrated.
[01:25:11.875 --> 01:25:14.696]  My dad is a quasi-retired dentist, oral surgeon.
[01:25:14.956 --> 01:25:18.117]  He helped develop this with one of the biggest manufacturers in the country.
[01:25:18.257 --> 01:25:18.957]  It's amazing.
[01:25:19.337 --> 01:25:22.959]  And again, when you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off.
[01:25:23.059 --> 01:25:23.619]  It's a win-win.
[01:25:24.139 --> 01:25:28.022]  You remember to support us each month, or every two months, or every three months, however you sign up.
[01:25:28.422 --> 01:25:39.369]  You can cancel anytime, and you can get 10% off, and then don't have to remember to keep supporting us, and also get the products that obviously run out, that you've got to replenish.
[01:25:39.609 --> 01:25:41.151]  These are great renewable resources.
[01:25:41.471 --> 01:25:42.591]  Please continue to support us.
[01:25:42.672 --> 01:25:45.173]  Again, I want to defeat the globalists.
[01:25:45.233 --> 01:25:45.874]  I'm determined.
[01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:46.494]  I'm focused.
[01:25:47.034 --> 01:25:51.958]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us, and without you praying for us,
[01:25:53.462 --> 01:25:54.928]  We don't have a chance in hell.
[01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:57.117]  But if you get behind us like you've already done...
[01:25:58.783 --> 01:25:59.704]  Turn it up a notch?
[01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:03.907]  We are unstoppable, ladies and gentlemen, because humans want freedom.
[01:26:04.227 --> 01:26:06.528]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[01:26:06.769 --> 01:26:07.949]  We want to go to the stars.
[01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:09.591]  Look how far we've already come.
[01:26:09.851 --> 01:26:11.572]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[01:26:11.872 --> 01:26:14.874]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[01:26:15.154 --> 01:26:18.176]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[01:26:18.477 --> 01:26:22.660]  Let's tell Ted Turner, who could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.221]  And let's take action.
[01:26:24.741 --> 01:26:32.856]  There's nowhere you can spend your hard-earned money to get better products and then make sure that money goes to a good cause than InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:26:33.096 --> 01:26:34.419]  But regardless of what you do...
[01:26:35.427 --> 01:26:45.913]  Spread the links, spread the articles, and let people know about this 30-hour special broadcast so new people tune in and learn about the nightly news, the daily show I do, and the news sites and everything we're engaged in.
[01:26:45.953 --> 01:26:51.336]  Because we're not perfect, but our hearts are in the right place and we are pulling as hard as we can for victory.
[01:26:51.797 --> 01:27:00.161]  Now back to the live transmission with the amazing host and guest and special reports during the 30-hour broadcast that we're now partway into.
[01:27:00.522 --> 01:27:03.003]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:27:03.283 --> 01:27:04.544]  Please spread that link.
[01:27:06.081 --> 01:27:12.724]  And we are 21 plus hours into our 30-hour In Defense of Free Speech Marathon broadcast.
[01:27:12.804 --> 01:27:13.784]  I'm your host, Rob Due.
[01:27:14.004 --> 01:27:28.790]  Sitting next to me over there, Michael Zimmerman, one of our editors slash producer slash tech guy slash reporter slash director slash camera guy slash driver slash figuring out how these millennial gadgets work.
[01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:29.330]  A lot of hats.
[01:27:29.691 --> 01:27:30.491]  He kind of does it all.
[01:27:31.863 --> 01:27:33.565]  So, Michael, what do you have for us right now?
[01:27:34.105 --> 01:27:35.927]  I want to talk about socialism and communism.
[01:27:36.447 --> 01:27:40.351]  We went out on... Wait, you mean the mythical world where everything's for free?
[01:27:40.691 --> 01:27:41.692]  Yeah.
[01:27:41.752 --> 01:27:43.034]  And we don't have to work?
[01:27:43.394 --> 01:27:44.755]  And we all have the same standard of living?
[01:27:44.775 --> 01:27:46.977]  Government takes care of us?
[01:27:47.998 --> 01:27:48.799]  That sounds excellent.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.381]  If only someone's tried it.
[01:27:50.561 --> 01:27:54.805]  Oh wait, a lot of people have tried it and it didn't work and they killed a hundred million people over the past hundred years.
[01:27:55.573 --> 01:27:56.214]  Racist.
[01:27:56.434 --> 01:27:57.615]  Oh, that is very racist.
[01:27:57.935 --> 01:28:01.958]  No, no one's, no one's ever, their argument is always, no one's tried true communism.
[01:28:02.499 --> 01:28:03.019]  It'll be different.
[01:28:03.119 --> 01:28:04.741]  That's a different form of communism.
[01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:06.482]  It'll be different with Bernie.
[01:28:06.502 --> 01:28:07.943]  He's a democratic socialist.
[01:28:08.083 --> 01:28:08.944]  He's a socialist.
[01:28:08.984 --> 01:28:09.805]  He's reasonable.
[01:28:11.071 --> 01:28:13.593]  And then you go, well, we don't really have a true form of capitalism.
[01:28:13.633 --> 01:28:16.455]  Yeah, but capitalism is... We have crony capitalism.
[01:28:16.555 --> 01:28:17.235]  Exactly.
[01:28:17.495 --> 01:28:21.418]  And people don't want to accept that fact that our capitalism is not true capitalism, free market.
[01:28:21.558 --> 01:28:27.422]  But even our bastardized version of capitalism... Still gives people like me and you a chance to get ahead.
[01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:28.503]  Exactly.
[01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:30.784]  Like my grandparents grew up on a farm.
[01:28:30.924 --> 01:28:33.006]  They had a... Wait, that could have sounded racist.
[01:28:33.106 --> 01:28:35.407]  I pointed to you and me and we're both white guys.
[01:28:35.447 --> 01:28:36.868]  I could say it gives us a chance to get ahead.
[01:28:36.908 --> 01:28:37.849]  Did you just assume my race?
[01:28:37.929 --> 01:28:39.310]  I just assumed your race and gender.
[01:28:41.283 --> 01:28:41.884]  Yeah, I know.
[01:28:41.964 --> 01:28:42.604]  Don't get triggered.
[01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:43.826]  He's getting triggered.
[01:28:43.846 --> 01:28:44.566]  I'm real triggered here.
[01:28:45.747 --> 01:28:49.771]  Flames Fatality at Venezuela Demo over Leaders Crisis Maneuver.
[01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:55.177]  So, 32 people have been killed in the oil-rich nation stricken by food shortages.
[01:28:55.397 --> 01:28:55.577]  Oh!
[01:28:56.238 --> 01:28:56.358]  Oh!
[01:28:56.638 --> 01:28:59.120]  And I think they just had an arm... Is that the armored car story?
[01:28:59.821 --> 01:29:02.662]  They had an armored car from the police run over and injure 300 people.
[01:29:02.822 --> 01:29:04.663]  You can see that on the camera.
[01:29:05.843 --> 01:29:06.123]  Yeah.
[01:29:06.943 --> 01:29:10.525]  Fires in the streets, firebombs, Molotov cocktails.
[01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:13.826]  Socialism's working real well for them, or their communism's working very well.
[01:29:14.786 --> 01:29:17.187]  I guess now in order to heat your home you have to light yourself on fire.
[01:29:17.207 --> 01:29:19.508]  Well, and you have to go to a neighboring country to buy toilet paper.
[01:29:19.528 --> 01:29:19.988]  That's cool.
[01:29:21.228 --> 01:29:22.469]  Food, you know, bread lines.
[01:29:24.542 --> 01:29:30.952]  And, uh, you know, like Bernie Sanders said, um, well, at least people who, uh, at least they had bread lines instead of no food.
[01:29:30.972 --> 01:29:31.913]  It's like...
[01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:33.851]  That's a good thing?
[01:29:33.871 --> 01:29:35.052]  That's what we should aspire for?
[01:29:35.072 --> 01:29:42.318]  We should aspire to the least common denominator, because that's what made countries great, is just aspiring to the lowest form of work that somebody wants to do.
[01:29:42.338 --> 01:29:43.799]  Let's just all hang out and be slugs.
[01:29:43.819 --> 01:29:44.460]  Let's do the minimum.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.541]  Look at our phones and stuff.
[01:29:45.561 --> 01:29:52.907]  But we were walking around on Monday talking to these Antifa protestors, who, the very first one... They were not protestors.
[01:29:52.927 --> 01:29:54.328]  They were live-action role players.
[01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:55.409]  They are.
[01:29:55.429 --> 01:29:56.971]  I forget what the head-on was.
[01:29:57.031 --> 01:29:59.333]  It was something... LARPing as revolutionaries.
[01:30:01.045 --> 01:30:03.407]  And that perfectly describes what these guys are doing.
[01:30:03.767 --> 01:30:06.890]  They're a bunch of social rejects, kind of.
[01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:10.372]  I feel a lot of these people need a friend, like you were saying.
[01:30:11.233 --> 01:30:15.937]  And all they're saying is, F-Info Wars, F-Info Wars, F-Info Wars.
[01:30:16.017 --> 01:30:17.218]  All the first guy could say here.
[01:30:18.999 --> 01:30:20.821]  We played that clip earlier and you can find it.
[01:30:20.961 --> 01:30:24.565]  Hordes of escaped mental patients wandering the streets of Austin.
[01:30:25.006 --> 01:30:27.048]  Because that is what we are looking at.
[01:30:27.409 --> 01:30:31.113]  And we now have our guest on the phone, Lionel, joining us from New York City.
[01:30:31.153 --> 01:30:32.434]  Lionel, how are you doing there, sir?
[01:30:34.088 --> 01:30:35.850]  I'm doing fine there, sir.
[01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:42.236]  I don't have a video here, so I trust you're looking beauteous and you're in fighting trim.
[01:30:42.677 --> 01:30:43.337]  We are beautiful.
[01:30:43.457 --> 01:30:45.079]  Are you assuming my beauty level right now?
[01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:50.705]  Well, you know what they say when you assume something or other.
[01:30:51.025 --> 01:30:52.126]  Make an ass out of you and me.
[01:30:52.146 --> 01:30:52.647]  You can say that.
[01:30:52.667 --> 01:30:53.668]  We're not on the radio yet.
[01:30:54.986 --> 01:30:56.327]  No, no, no, no.
[01:30:56.367 --> 01:30:59.108]  We got to be very, very careful because you don't want to pull a cold bear.
[01:30:59.128 --> 01:30:59.828]  That's true.
[01:30:59.868 --> 01:31:00.789]  Or any of those others.
[01:31:01.009 --> 01:31:02.430]  By the way, I just got to tell you something.
[01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:15.716]  I have been, I don't want to derail the course of this incredibly structured and choreographed radio and intellectual mail lounge.
[01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:16.696]  You give us too much credit.
[01:31:19.258 --> 01:31:21.719]  Well, just pop some more of those, you know, those
[01:31:23.152 --> 01:31:28.918]  Uh, vitamin uppers, but the thing is that I am so disgusted by the double standard.
[01:31:29.659 --> 01:31:33.143]  Look, I just want somebody just to say, look, let's all play by the same rule, okay?
[01:31:33.604 --> 01:31:34.865]  We don't say this.
[01:31:35.005 --> 01:31:35.826]  You don't say this.
[01:31:36.587 --> 01:31:36.887]  Fine.
[01:31:37.388 --> 01:31:37.748]  That's it.
[01:31:38.349 --> 01:31:39.690]  Whatever's good for you is good for us.
[01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:41.272]  Everybody apply by the same rule.
[01:31:41.792 --> 01:31:43.815]  Nobody really cares about, look, we're all adults.
[01:31:44.534 --> 01:31:49.518]  Nobody cares what Bill Barrett says in the first part, but I understand the concept, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:49.878 --> 01:31:53.621]  But don't you love the fact that if you say it, well, it's hell on wheels.
[01:31:53.661 --> 01:32:05.569]  God forbid Alex says the same thing that somebody else says, or you, or anybody else for that matter, they're going to have all kinds of protesters, and they're going to talk about you from Congress, and the UN's going to pass a resolution, and you're a hate criminal, and blah, blah, blah.
[01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:07.411]  But if other people do it, oh!
[01:32:08.351 --> 01:32:08.492]  Oh!
[01:32:09.532 --> 01:32:13.673]  It's the same if you pass classified secrets to your perverted husband.
[01:32:13.913 --> 01:32:16.474]  That's okay, too, because your intentions weren't bad.
[01:32:16.494 --> 01:32:20.354]  Eh, you know, it was okay.
[01:32:20.374 --> 01:32:21.315]  You know, he's my husband.
[01:32:21.355 --> 01:32:23.415]  I pass him classified material all the time.
[01:32:25.015 --> 01:32:26.336]  I didn't have any bad intentions.
[01:32:27.156 --> 01:32:29.716]  You know, I'm sorry you feel nauseated, FBI Director.
[01:32:29.736 --> 01:32:32.997]  Imagine going to a pitch meeting and you say, I got this idea.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:39.002]  And the story about a woman, she's a first lady, she runs once, she loses.
[01:32:39.542 --> 01:32:52.508]  She and her husband put together this basically kind of a Ponzi scheme meets unprosecuted criminal cabal, the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative that make the Gambino crime family look like the Junior League.
[01:32:52.848 --> 01:32:55.789]  And then she suffers from a series of neurological problems.
[01:32:56.089 --> 01:32:57.330]  She collapses in front of people.
[01:32:57.590 --> 01:33:03.012]  She has as her lieutenant a woman with all kinds of interesting Muslim brotherhood, perhaps
[01:33:03.012 --> 01:33:04.304]  I don't know who she is.
[01:33:05.908 --> 01:33:16.653]  Her perverted, skeevy husband who basically is a pedophile who takes pictures of his, dare I say, menschel itself.
[01:33:16.973 --> 01:33:31.359]  If ever you want to, what you guys should do is take the tweets, the Anthony Weiner tweets, and that Sidney Leathers or whoever these people are, and read them in a theater setting in a Shakespearean style.
[01:33:34.201 --> 01:33:34.501]  Yes.
[01:33:35.082 --> 01:33:42.107]  Oh, and to you, I will, when I get done with you, you will require crutches.
[01:33:42.187 --> 01:33:43.047]  And oh my God.
[01:33:43.127 --> 01:33:44.288]  Anyway, this is to children.
[01:33:44.308 --> 01:33:44.808]  15 year old.
[01:33:44.828 --> 01:33:44.989]  Yes.
[01:33:45.009 --> 01:33:45.169]  Well.
[01:33:47.603 --> 01:33:54.309]  And if you presented this to a Hollywood scriptwriter, producer, showrunner, and you said, here's my idea.
[01:33:54.329 --> 01:33:55.630]  They would say, nobody would believe this.
[01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:56.731]  This is too far fetched.
[01:33:56.751 --> 01:33:57.351]  This is nuts.
[01:33:57.731 --> 01:34:02.956]  It doesn't even resemble anything that could basically simulate reality.
[01:34:03.276 --> 01:34:04.257]  This is where we're living!
[01:34:04.657 --> 01:34:06.718]  This is a high-level guy in the Democratic Party, too.
[01:34:06.778 --> 01:34:09.580]  He's not just some nobody, local-level guy.
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:11.541]  He's a Democratic leader.
[01:34:11.581 --> 01:34:12.902]  Yeah, he really is.
[01:34:13.342 --> 01:34:14.183]  Well, he was, at least.
[01:34:14.243 --> 01:34:17.465]  Now, not even they can bear to look at him.
[01:34:18.245 --> 01:34:24.849]  He's been cast off, he's been outvoted, and now he's just wandering the streets trying to remain relevant.
[01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:26.610]  His name was brought up again yesterday.
[01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:38.538]  I think even Comey said at one point there's no Weiner, Anthony Weiner statute to getting classified material and thinking that that's okay when they go after people who've done a lot less.
[01:34:38.578 --> 01:34:50.065]  I think there was a there's a guy he's either in the Army or Marines and it was one classified file was left on a computer and he got kicked out of the Army and he lost his pension, lost everything.
[01:34:50.625 --> 01:34:52.546]  One classified material.
[01:34:53.286 --> 01:34:56.829]  Okay, here's he got 6,000 that they know of, that they read.
[01:34:57.749 --> 01:34:58.410]  And that's okay.
[01:34:58.490 --> 01:35:00.671]  Bleach, spit, wipe away, and cover up.
[01:35:00.892 --> 01:35:01.432]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:01.452 --> 01:35:07.917]  By the way, not only... No, I'm sorry, not only that, but what about these teachers who do some things?
[01:35:07.957 --> 01:35:11.339]  Look, I'm not going to defend anybody with kids, but again, it goes back to the double standard.
[01:35:11.359 --> 01:35:14.341]  What about teachers who are sending texts back and forth?
[01:35:14.702 --> 01:35:17.224]  Now, this is a guy who... Wait, let me add to this.
[01:35:17.304 --> 01:35:19.465]  This is the part that gets me.
[01:35:19.745 --> 01:35:22.968]  If you folks decide to throw your lives away and your careers away,
[01:35:25.547 --> 01:35:32.490]  Disgrace, defile, completely just sully your marital vows, humiliate your wife, your family, whatever.
[01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:48.617]  Please, do have the decency of meeting the woman, going to a hotel, doing it the old-fashioned way, where you can say, oh yeah, I met her, and we had sex, and I wore a night jacket and pants, and a bow whip, and you know, we, yeah, we, whips and chains and great dames.
[01:35:48.837 --> 01:35:49.697]  Yes, I met her.
[01:35:49.997 --> 01:35:51.338]  Versus, did you meet her?
[01:35:51.358 --> 01:35:51.398]  No.
[01:35:52.597 --> 01:35:53.737]  Could you pick her out of a lineup?
[01:35:54.297 --> 01:35:54.497]  No.
[01:35:54.837 --> 01:35:55.538]  What does she look like?
[01:35:55.738 --> 01:35:58.178]  I think she looks like, I'm not sure, a woman.
[01:35:58.218 --> 01:35:59.318]  You've never met her?
[01:35:59.678 --> 01:35:59.838]  No.
[01:36:00.239 --> 01:36:00.439]  Yeah.
[01:36:00.479 --> 01:36:03.879]  Can I see them from the neck down?
[01:36:04.559 --> 01:36:06.080]  You typed her?
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.020]  You texted her?
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:09.860]  What?
[01:36:10.381 --> 01:36:11.121]  Think about that.
[01:36:11.601 --> 01:36:12.861]  I mean, think about this.
[01:36:13.081 --> 01:36:19.862]  It's like the guy who shows up to the, he's going to rob a bank, never even crosses the threshold.
[01:36:20.223 --> 01:36:22.023]  They arrest him in the car.
[01:36:23.248 --> 01:36:25.429]  But it was a conspiracy and you might as well have done it.
[01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:31.413]  So, this, I mean, just, just ask yourself, what are we talking about today?
[01:36:31.493 --> 01:36:32.433]  What are we, seriously?
[01:36:32.914 --> 01:36:35.455]  This is, I, it's, you can't write this.
[01:36:35.715 --> 01:36:36.536]  And here's the best part.
[01:36:37.536 --> 01:36:38.577]  And Alex is crazy.
[01:36:39.798 --> 01:36:41.619]  Great.
[01:36:41.719 --> 01:36:42.519]  He's the crazy one.
[01:36:42.539 --> 01:36:43.020]  Oh, you're crazy.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:44.841]  You're in for it.
[01:36:45.061 --> 01:36:45.861]  You're nuts.
[01:36:46.302 --> 01:36:47.042]  You're nuts?
[01:36:47.782 --> 01:36:48.363]  You are?
[01:36:48.383 --> 01:36:49.704]  Oh, no, that's different.
[01:36:49.724 --> 01:36:50.524]  That's, uh.
[01:36:50.624 --> 01:36:51.885]  We're not trying to molest children.
[01:36:55.382 --> 01:36:57.183]  Or advocating for their sacrifice?
[01:36:57.203 --> 01:36:59.886]  I still think we've got the moral high ground here, regardless.
[01:37:00.766 --> 01:37:03.929]  So, Lionel, today's supposed to be the big healthcare vote on the Hill.
[01:37:03.989 --> 01:37:08.872]  This is like the third time I think they're going to bring it up, or it may be another head fake.
[01:37:09.233 --> 01:37:13.976]  What do you think will happen, and does the government have, can they fix Obamacare?
[01:37:14.697 --> 01:37:15.337]  The Republicans.
[01:37:16.678 --> 01:37:17.859]  I don't think anybody wants to.
[01:37:17.879 --> 01:37:23.784]  I don't think, look, as long as you have the insurance industry involved in this,
[01:37:24.597 --> 01:37:25.458]  Nothing's ever going to happen.
[01:37:25.998 --> 01:37:28.541]  Look, you might think of this as being extreme.
[01:37:28.901 --> 01:37:33.185]  You might think of me as being some kind of a socialist or some kind of Marxist or whatever it is.
[01:37:33.946 --> 01:37:46.097]  I would have absolutely no problem by declaring war on disease and focusing our attention on American citizens and not these saber rattling in North Korea and Russia and Syria.
[01:37:47.094 --> 01:37:48.697]  I would like to, but there's no money in that.
[01:37:49.077 --> 01:37:49.738]  See, there's no military.
[01:37:49.998 --> 01:37:51.841]  There's no health industrial complex.
[01:37:51.861 --> 01:37:53.083]  There's the insurance complex.
[01:37:53.684 --> 01:37:56.508]  But I would have no problem in basically... Let me just tell you something.
[01:37:56.688 --> 01:38:01.736]  Do you know that if I were the president, God forbid, but if I were to say, I'm going to do something,
[01:38:02.356 --> 01:38:06.879]  I'm going to do something because I believe, as you do, in nature and health.
[01:38:07.099 --> 01:38:19.227]  I'm going to do something where I'm going to make natural health foods available to poor Americans, maybe in urban areas that live in bodegas and fast food.
[01:38:19.307 --> 01:38:24.971]  And I'm going to basically provide whatever it is, just vegetables, organic.
[01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:29.794]  And if I were to just decrease the national BMI by a point,
[01:38:30.518 --> 01:38:31.118]  Nothing big.
[01:38:31.459 --> 01:38:38.163]  Do you know how many heart attacks, kidney failure, diabetes, strokes, what I could do?
[01:38:38.183 --> 01:38:38.984]  Cancer, cancer.
[01:38:39.324 --> 01:38:39.705]  Cancer!
[01:38:39.805 --> 01:38:44.888]  I'm not even, I mean, just look at, we are looking at right now, we are in a health crisis.
[01:38:45.028 --> 01:38:53.054]  Obesity, you know, there was a time, I remember this, I remember when I was a kid, we thought, God, boy, that, that, that Jackie Gleason, boy, he's so fat, fat.
[01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:54.949]  He weighs 300 pounds.
[01:38:54.969 --> 01:38:55.229]  300 pounds?
[01:38:55.289 --> 01:38:57.570]  There's kids in the 5th grade who weigh 300 pounds.
[01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:58.651]  What are you talking about?
[01:38:59.071 --> 01:39:05.035]  There was a time in this country where in the turn of the 20th century, people would travel 100 miles to see a fat man in a carnival.
[01:39:05.335 --> 01:39:06.336]  Things were slow then.
[01:39:06.716 --> 01:39:08.077]  This guy weighs 300 pounds.
[01:39:08.337 --> 01:39:09.398]  That's nothing!
[01:39:09.418 --> 01:39:09.898]  Look at us!
[01:39:11.079 --> 01:39:12.640]  You can go to Walmart to see your fat man now.
[01:39:14.665 --> 01:39:19.388]  So we're in a country right now where we are, I mean, we are killing ourselves.
[01:39:19.468 --> 01:39:20.108]  Health is a problem.
[01:39:20.128 --> 01:39:24.070]  So instead, we're arguing about whether iron people talk about socialism, whatever.
[01:39:24.651 --> 01:39:25.992]  We have lost the argument.
[01:39:26.052 --> 01:39:26.652]  We have lost.
[01:39:26.692 --> 01:39:34.737]  Look, I declare war on disease and I want to focus on the American people and I want to make America healthy again or try to do it as well.
[01:39:35.397 --> 01:39:38.979]  And so that focus has long been obfuscated.
[01:39:39.019 --> 01:39:42.101]  By the way, can I bring something up just to throw this off?
[01:39:43.018 --> 01:39:43.739]  Let's do it.
[01:39:43.919 --> 01:39:44.439]  Go for it.
[01:39:44.659 --> 01:39:44.940]  Okay.
[01:39:46.861 --> 01:39:47.882]  I like your style.
[01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:50.204]  Here's something nobody's expected.
[01:39:51.845 --> 01:39:55.168]  I am fascinated by the royal family.
[01:39:55.448 --> 01:39:55.929]  Let me tell you what.
[01:39:56.489 --> 01:39:58.111]  I think they are the smartest people in the world.
[01:39:58.291 --> 01:39:58.711]  Why is that?
[01:39:58.731 --> 01:40:08.019]  Because anybody who can con a country into paying for them, into basically supporting this lifestyle, and portraying the conduct through some kind of divine
[01:40:09.265 --> 01:40:09.605]  Right.
[01:40:10.225 --> 01:40:16.807]  These consanguineous homozygotic cousins, these inbred freaks, are royalty!
[01:40:17.647 --> 01:40:18.468]  Royalty!
[01:40:18.928 --> 01:40:22.809]  I mean, this is a Mendelian genetics nightmare.
[01:40:22.849 --> 01:40:27.910]  Prince Philip, by the way, did you see the big announcement?
[01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:30.071]  He's retiring from his eternal vacation.
[01:40:30.411 --> 01:40:31.891]  That was the big news story today.
[01:40:32.592 --> 01:40:33.672]  All the press gathered for it.
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:37.983]  I can't see the video here, but I know you've got that Skycam thing.
[01:40:38.543 --> 01:40:40.565]  Just Google his gaffes.
[01:40:41.546 --> 01:40:44.649]  Google the stuff he has said to people.
[01:40:44.889 --> 01:40:47.151]  If ever you see Prince Philip, who by the way is Greek.
[01:40:47.932 --> 01:40:48.533]  He's not British.
[01:40:48.613 --> 01:40:49.634]  In 1947, he changed.
[01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:57.934]  He the this family tree looks like a Brussels sprout.
[01:40:57.954 --> 01:41:02.858]  You've got people who aren't even connected and married, but they have no problem with that whatsoever.
[01:41:02.998 --> 01:41:07.982]  But you have this fellow who basically they announced that he's going to be stepping down from his duties.
[01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:13.087]  And and and I laugh with delight.
[01:41:13.848 --> 01:41:14.448]  Listen to this.
[01:41:14.628 --> 01:41:16.610]  A friend of mine one time said very serious.
[01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:18.832]  He says, you know what I don't like about the royal family?
[01:41:18.852 --> 01:41:21.314]  He says it's so un-American.
[01:41:22.136 --> 01:41:23.877]  And I laughed at first and I realized, I said, wait a minute.
[01:41:24.917 --> 01:41:31.599]  There's something that is so un-American about the idea about somebody handing you a government right, being handed to you.
[01:41:31.799 --> 01:41:32.279]  Yeah, sure.
[01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:33.780]  Inherit your family's business.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:34.820]  No problem.
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:35.480]  I got it.
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:37.681]  No problem whatsoever with that.
[01:41:38.381 --> 01:41:48.024]  But when Kate Middleton and when Wills and Harry, his brother.
[01:41:48.684 --> 01:41:49.084]  OK.
[01:41:49.364 --> 01:41:49.624]  All right.
[01:41:49.664 --> 01:41:50.305]  I'm buying that.
[01:41:50.365 --> 01:41:50.625]  Sure.
[01:41:50.645 --> 01:41:50.725]  Yeah.
[01:41:52.017 --> 01:41:53.738]  All right, he's his brother, huh?
[01:41:54.379 --> 01:41:57.361]  Don't look at any pictures, but okay, fine, very good.
[01:41:58.221 --> 01:42:01.183]  Don't bring up Major Hewitt, don't bring up Lord Porchester and Andrew.
[01:42:01.203 --> 01:42:03.285]  I mean, you can't believe this.
[01:42:03.605 --> 01:42:12.971]  There's one thing we can say, well, and I'm not going to do too much detail, but in terms of our people in politics, the kids are theirs.
[01:42:13.752 --> 01:42:18.535]  There might be an exception here or there, but in the UK, they know this, they care nothing about this.
[01:42:19.035 --> 01:42:21.557]  And the royal family, to me,
[01:42:23.283 --> 01:42:26.224]  Is just an example of this anachronism.
[01:42:26.745 --> 01:42:27.685]  How is it?
[01:42:28.305 --> 01:42:29.326]  And people falling over.
[01:42:29.426 --> 01:42:32.827]  And I'm sure Kate's a great gal and Will's doesn't know whatever it is.
[01:42:32.907 --> 01:42:36.008]  But what what year is this?
[01:42:36.388 --> 01:42:37.889]  What century are we living in?
[01:42:37.929 --> 01:42:41.090]  I mean, is there no progress or what?
[01:42:41.411 --> 01:42:43.111]  As soon as we move, we're mapping the genome.
[01:42:43.131 --> 01:42:44.052]  We're going in this direction.
[01:42:44.072 --> 01:42:45.012]  And then we look back.
[01:42:45.212 --> 01:42:48.613]  We have the monarchy, this group, this crew.
[01:42:48.633 --> 01:42:52.075]  I mean, and there's something about name one big family.
[01:42:53.641 --> 01:42:56.022]  That can be filled with mental illness, alright?
[01:42:56.382 --> 01:43:01.903]  The Kennedys, the royal family, other councils maybe, you know, there's a difference.
[01:43:02.123 --> 01:43:12.686]  But I just want to know, and maybe you can help me, what is this anglophilic love affair, this fetish that we have over the royal family?
[01:43:12.806 --> 01:43:13.266]  I don't get it.
[01:43:14.025 --> 01:43:16.726]  Well, those that have the fetish, I think, stayed on the little island.
[01:43:17.166 --> 01:43:18.607]  And those who didn't came to America.
[01:43:19.147 --> 01:43:20.588]  Because I think it's ridiculous.
[01:43:20.648 --> 01:43:22.409]  It's a bunch of pageantry, a bunch of hoopla.
[01:43:23.309 --> 01:43:23.989]  They don't need it.
[01:43:24.670 --> 01:43:25.790]  I was looking for a story.
[01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:32.373]  The Queen of England gets tax breaks and other types of welfare to heat her home.
[01:43:33.471 --> 01:43:36.454]  That's how much these parasites... Palace guards, things like that.
[01:43:36.474 --> 01:43:39.036]  That's what taxpayers pay for their lifestyle.
[01:43:39.096 --> 01:43:40.197]  They just perched up there.
[01:43:40.277 --> 01:43:44.000]  Now we're going to retire from this life of luxury.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:51.085]  It's totally ridiculous that people still follow these creatures, especially the Queen of England.
[01:43:52.987 --> 01:43:53.187]  Right.
[01:43:53.247 --> 01:43:58.451]  This is another thing, too, where I wake up every day and I think, I say, what freaks me out again today?
[01:43:58.571 --> 01:43:59.132]  What is wrong?
[01:43:59.372 --> 01:44:01.674]  I just don't under... I just don't get it.
[01:44:02.445 --> 01:44:07.648]  I just don't understand how things work.
[01:44:07.888 --> 01:44:15.173]  I don't understand how people can sit here and say, you know, this is important and this is not.
[01:44:15.213 --> 01:44:22.357]  You know, one of the things that's so interesting, and by the way, what you're doing, I want to thank you for that, and Alex and this organization.
[01:44:22.377 --> 01:44:31.783]  You're much in a different position than I am, but I was talking to some people today and I happened to be on the IMAX show.
[01:44:32.822 --> 01:44:36.265]  I was talking to some friends of mine in the business, and I said, you know, I'm going to be doing this thing with Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:36.505 --> 01:44:37.365]  Alex Jones!
[01:44:38.206 --> 01:44:39.087]  And then they do one of these.
[01:44:40.067 --> 01:44:40.548]  I love him!
[01:44:41.088 --> 01:44:41.849]  I said, what are you doing?
[01:44:41.889 --> 01:44:46.452]  And it looks like he's about to tell an improper joke, you know, like, you know, you remember the old joke about when somebody does this?
[01:44:46.532 --> 01:44:48.213]  He's about to tell you something that he doesn't want people to know.
[01:44:48.233 --> 01:44:50.935]  I said, do you know how many people listen?
[01:44:51.495 --> 01:44:51.736]  Do you?
[01:44:52.176 --> 01:44:52.896]  Yes, you do, of course.
[01:44:52.936 --> 01:44:54.157]  But I say this rhetorically.
[01:44:54.237 --> 01:44:59.101]  Do you know how many people look at this and you are like,
[01:44:59.861 --> 01:45:04.124]  The chemtrail, the geoengineering, the solar radiation management.
[01:45:04.505 --> 01:45:10.650]  They look up, they see it, they understand it, but they can't bring themselves to admit it's true.
[01:45:11.230 --> 01:45:12.992]  This is not the future.
[01:45:13.012 --> 01:45:14.773]  This is now.
[01:45:15.333 --> 01:45:16.314]  This is it.
[01:45:16.674 --> 01:45:17.075]  This is
[01:45:18.415 --> 01:45:21.556]  I mean, I hope you never take this for granted.
[01:45:21.816 --> 01:45:25.838]  I hope you never, ever think, like, oh, this is... It's always going to be like this.
[01:45:25.858 --> 01:45:26.098]  It's normal.
[01:45:26.118 --> 01:45:29.839]  It's always going to be... Yeah, no, they're trying to take away our free speech.
[01:45:29.859 --> 01:45:43.783]  Do you have people in your line of work, where you're at up in New York, do you have people, because that's not Trump territory, really, even though he lives there, are people getting on you for being, you know, you're not even, I would say, a huge Trump supporter, but you're also not an attacker either.
[01:45:44.123 --> 01:45:45.724]  Debbie, do you get a bunch of flack for that?
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:47.381]  Oh yeah!
[01:45:47.481 --> 01:45:47.781]  Oh yeah!
[01:45:47.801 --> 01:45:54.209]  In fact, in fact, I'm looking out right now the window, and you can't see us of course, but I'm looking at the Intrepid.
[01:45:55.190 --> 01:45:56.933]  Where he will be later, and it's gonna be hell.
[01:45:58.047 --> 01:46:08.869]  And there were these people, and keep in mind, when I was a kid growing up, I was a child of the 60s, and our music was about a cause, it was about the war.
[01:46:09.369 --> 01:46:17.391]  It wasn't, we hate LBJ, he's an idiot, he's got little hands or big ears, or Nixon's a jerk, Nixon's ugly, Nixon.
[01:46:17.611 --> 01:46:20.171]  No, I mean, they didn't like them, but it was about a cause.
[01:46:20.831 --> 01:46:23.772]  The Smothers Brothers was, believe it or not,
[01:46:24.970 --> 01:46:30.733]  I mean, they were taken off the air because they basically took a stand against concept.
[01:46:30.753 --> 01:46:36.535]  When people marched, they didn't wear funny woolen hats and wear engorged foam rubber pudenda.
[01:46:36.876 --> 01:46:37.956]  They had a cause.
[01:46:37.996 --> 01:46:39.617]  They said it was about the war, it was about this and that.
[01:46:40.097 --> 01:46:46.100]  So I was reading, there's going to be a big protest, and it's a lot of people who are basically
[01:46:48.283 --> 01:46:49.444]  It's about the Instagrams.
[01:46:49.864 --> 01:46:51.105]  Hey, we're going to be out there today.
[01:46:51.145 --> 01:46:51.886]  This is cool.
[01:46:51.986 --> 01:46:53.968]  I'm going to take some selfies, bro.
[01:46:54.008 --> 01:46:57.511]  It's trendy and you can tell that I'm a selfie revolutionary.
[01:46:58.211 --> 01:47:05.918]  The whole protest thing isn't really so significant anymore because or has lost a lot of its effect because people are just using it to look cool.
[01:47:06.258 --> 01:47:12.844]  Because even Pepsi is making an advertisement where it's like, oh, look, we're all having fun out of the protest and, you know, sharing a Pepsi together.
[01:47:12.864 --> 01:47:14.825]  That lasted.
[01:47:16.078 --> 01:47:17.258]  How long was that on the air?
[01:47:17.719 --> 01:47:23.220]  It's kind of a budget maneuver because now people are taking that meme and going, hey, let's go.
[01:47:23.321 --> 01:47:26.662]  It was funny because I don't think anyone liked the advertisement.
[01:47:27.022 --> 01:47:32.684]  Conservatives thought it was just stupid virtue signaling and leftists are like, oh, you're not taking us seriously.
[01:47:32.704 --> 01:47:35.385]  How dare you put Kendall Jenner in an ad of our oppression?
[01:47:35.445 --> 01:47:35.765]  All right.
[01:47:35.805 --> 01:47:37.725]  They said they had lots of issues with it.
[01:47:37.765 --> 01:47:40.686]  They said it, you know, made protests not look like a serious thing.
[01:47:40.766 --> 01:47:41.667]  And, you know,
[01:47:42.347 --> 01:47:45.549]  They kind of co-opted their whole resist thing.
[01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:51.252]  And Kendall Jenner, as a white woman, was not fit to be in this ad.
[01:47:51.792 --> 01:47:58.536]  Even though they obviously tried to get people of every single skin color in the world to be in their PC advertisement here.
[01:47:59.436 --> 01:48:01.397]  But she was nice to the cop.
[01:48:01.417 --> 01:48:06.520]  It looked like a Time Life special on races of the world.
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:06.600]  Wow.
[01:48:08.453 --> 01:48:09.454]  How did you get me?
[01:48:09.694 --> 01:48:11.856]  We have the woman in the hijab here.
[01:48:12.216 --> 01:48:14.978]  We have the generic brown-skinned man here.
[01:48:15.038 --> 01:48:17.621]  We have your... Let's check all the boxes.
[01:48:17.781 --> 01:48:19.442]  They went to the prop closet.
[01:48:19.462 --> 01:48:20.343]  Got an Indian headdress.
[01:48:20.363 --> 01:48:22.765]  Anybody want to wear this one?
[01:48:23.065 --> 01:48:24.566]  I've got an Egyptian Anka.
[01:48:24.826 --> 01:48:25.467]  Anybody?
[01:48:26.668 --> 01:48:27.689]  Here's a hat.
[01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:30.271]  Anybody over here?
[01:48:30.291 --> 01:48:32.733]  You know, what you do is you basically mock this.
[01:48:33.153 --> 01:48:35.215]  But see, here's the thing that kills me.
[01:48:35.495 --> 01:48:36.456]  I'll give you an example.
[01:48:37.330 --> 01:48:39.032]  And the answer is, do people take umbrage of me?
[01:48:39.352 --> 01:48:39.712]  Yes!
[01:48:40.293 --> 01:48:46.057]  And they have for 30 years, and the day they don't is the day I'm not doing something right, because I'm not making any sense.
[01:48:47.699 --> 01:48:53.424]  My wife was approached by the way she was talking with some of her friends, and he said, are you going to march for the Women's March?
[01:48:53.444 --> 01:48:54.244]  You're going to march?
[01:48:55.145 --> 01:48:56.846]  He said, what for?
[01:48:57.247 --> 01:48:58.027]  Oh, for women!
[01:48:58.047 --> 01:48:59.329]  Yeah, I know that.
[01:48:59.349 --> 01:48:59.969]  That's the thing.
[01:49:00.429 --> 01:49:01.310]  What in particular?
[01:49:02.171 --> 01:49:04.293]  Well, Trump.
[01:49:04.913 --> 01:49:05.614]  What about Trump?
[01:49:06.696 --> 01:49:09.977]  He said, you know, he's Trump.
[01:49:10.098 --> 01:49:13.719]  But women and Trump and women and Trump.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:19.482]  I'm going to wear a hat, a knit cap.
[01:49:20.362 --> 01:49:24.484]  I don't know what this thing is, but lumps like a giraffe has those lumpy things.
[01:49:24.504 --> 01:49:28.125]  I don't know what they're called, but I think it's supposed to look like cat ears, like a pussy cat.
[01:49:28.165 --> 01:49:29.726]  And they were calling it a pussy hat.
[01:49:32.007 --> 01:49:32.647]  You said it.
[01:49:32.707 --> 01:49:33.928]  It seemed a bit ridiculous.
[01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:37.771]  Hey, I want to jump back to the Queen for one second.
[01:49:37.811 --> 01:49:38.611]  I found that article.
[01:49:38.791 --> 01:49:39.592]  Listen to this, Lionel.
[01:49:40.032 --> 01:49:44.254]  Queen tried to use state poverty fund to heat Buckingham Palace.
[01:49:45.234 --> 01:49:45.554]  Okay?
[01:49:45.674 --> 01:49:48.996]  And when you dig into this article, let's see.
[01:49:49.176 --> 01:49:59.180]  AIDS complained to ministers in 2004 that the Queen's gas and electricity bills, which had increased by 50% that year, stood at more than $1 million a year and had become untenable.
[01:50:00.438 --> 01:50:05.039]  The Royal House would also complain that the 15 million government grant to maintain the Queen's palaces was inadequate.
[01:50:05.219 --> 01:50:06.179]  Oh no!
[01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:07.499]  That's not enough money!
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:13.001]  Hey, isn't the UK the same ones who was burning aborted fetuses to heat their hospitals?
[01:50:13.281 --> 01:50:17.662]  Maybe they could implement that in their... I'm sure the Queen's got some dead babies lying around.
[01:50:18.762 --> 01:50:19.642]  Do one favor for me.
[01:50:19.682 --> 01:50:22.423]  You know, we love this idea about politically incorrect.
[01:50:23.083 --> 01:50:28.964]  Prince Philip, you do know whose hands are permanently, I think, surgically
[01:50:30.057 --> 01:50:31.739]  Kind of behind the back.
[01:50:31.779 --> 01:50:32.559]  They're sutured.
[01:50:32.579 --> 01:50:34.721]  He walks behind the Queen.
[01:50:34.741 --> 01:50:36.583]  I mean, he's got it made, this guy.
[01:50:36.603 --> 01:50:39.125]  He's got it made.
[01:50:39.386 --> 01:50:40.286]  I don't know what he does.
[01:50:41.187 --> 01:50:44.050]  Have somebody Google Prince Philip's gaffes.
[01:50:45.231 --> 01:50:48.254]  Things he said about, oh, do you still throw spears?
[01:50:48.674 --> 01:50:51.737]  I mean, people read about him in Australia.
[01:50:52.674 --> 01:50:56.476]  He has said one horrible thing.
[01:50:56.857 --> 01:51:04.481]  Remember the line he said, my dream, and I'm paraphrasing, is to come back as a virus that wipes out people?
[01:51:04.501 --> 01:51:04.721]  Oh yeah.
[01:51:04.761 --> 01:51:08.043]  Just Google this man.
[01:51:08.143 --> 01:51:16.088]  Nobody says, hey Phil, or Gregor, or Stavros, or whatever your Greek name is, Mr. Brit.
[01:51:16.872 --> 01:51:17.692]  Lighten up!
[01:51:18.232 --> 01:51:19.613]  Shut up!
[01:51:20.373 --> 01:51:25.474]  I'm serious about this thing.
[01:51:26.154 --> 01:51:28.355]  Nothing affects these people.
[01:51:28.535 --> 01:51:28.855]  Nothing.
[01:51:29.135 --> 01:51:32.356]  Listen, we're living in a parallel universe.
[01:51:32.736 --> 01:51:35.637]  None of this makes any sense.
[01:51:35.877 --> 01:51:37.237]  By the way, you might want to go back to this.
[01:51:37.617 --> 01:51:40.598]  Trump was elected on a number of things.
[01:51:40.678 --> 01:51:41.378]  Make America Great.
[01:51:42.412 --> 01:51:46.553]  Jobs, infrastructure, by the way, it's in-frah, not in-fah.
[01:51:46.593 --> 01:51:51.135]  If I hear infrastructure one more time, I'm going to climb a bell tower, okay?
[01:51:51.155 --> 01:51:51.855]  Let's get it right.
[01:51:52.415 --> 01:51:56.496]  But what he does, he said basically, this is what I want to do.
[01:51:56.896 --> 01:52:05.599]  And you have Rex Tillerson saying, we have no beef with Syria, no look at a regime change, none of our business, finally, finally, finally somebody doing this.
[01:52:05.879 --> 01:52:06.359]  What happened?
[01:52:07.145 --> 01:52:07.765]  Automatically.
[01:52:07.925 --> 01:52:08.806]  Boots on the ground.
[01:52:09.286 --> 01:52:09.926]  Let's do this.
[01:52:10.927 --> 01:52:14.789]  Well, yeah, they attacked the airbase, but it was a pinprick.
[01:52:15.309 --> 01:52:15.489]  What?
[01:52:15.649 --> 01:52:15.829]  What?
[01:52:15.989 --> 01:52:17.010]  Tomahawk missile pin?
[01:52:17.650 --> 01:52:19.191]  But they left the runway.
[01:52:20.071 --> 01:52:20.572]  Why?
[01:52:20.972 --> 01:52:26.315]  Look, I'm not advocating war, but I'll be damned if I'm going to go after an airport.
[01:52:26.875 --> 01:52:28.336]  First thing I'm going for is a runway.
[01:52:28.836 --> 01:52:29.376]  First thing.
[01:52:29.836 --> 01:52:31.237]  No runway, no airport.
[01:52:31.917 --> 01:52:35.059]  If there's no runway, it's a parking garage.
[01:52:36.128 --> 01:52:37.349]  I don't understand any of this.
[01:52:37.809 --> 01:52:50.314]  And then they bombed the place that basically was used by Assad to protect and defend Christian towns against nuisances over intimidation of terrorism you can imagine this week.
[01:52:50.354 --> 01:52:53.015]  Now, what was that about?
[01:52:53.515 --> 01:52:54.976]  So friends of mine said, aha!
[01:52:55.774 --> 01:52:57.055]  That's your boy, Trump!
[01:52:57.555 --> 01:52:58.115]  Look at you!
[01:52:58.175 --> 01:52:59.656]  I said, I didn't vote for Trump.
[01:52:59.856 --> 01:53:01.717]  For the record, I voted for me.
[01:53:02.037 --> 01:53:08.279]  I write my name in, swear to God, Lotus, Lionel of the United States, Lotus for POTUS.
[01:53:08.579 --> 01:53:09.700]  Every four years, me!
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:11.141]  I don't believe in this party business.
[01:53:11.561 --> 01:53:23.646]  But I figured, but I sure as hell am not going to let this felon, this, this, I mean, this, this evil queen anywhere near the... So, because
[01:53:24.469 --> 01:53:28.413]  In our country, it's very Manichaean, very apodatic, very either-or.
[01:53:28.433 --> 01:53:30.715]  You either love Trump or you hate Trump.
[01:53:30.955 --> 01:53:33.837]  And if you don't hate him, you must love him, which is insane.
[01:53:34.638 --> 01:53:37.240]  But he's talking about going after Assange?
[01:53:37.601 --> 01:53:41.924]  He's talking about, he's turning the keys over to these neocon warmongers?
[01:53:42.045 --> 01:53:42.565]  Madison?
[01:53:42.865 --> 01:53:43.766]  What is he doing?
[01:53:44.206 --> 01:53:51.373]  That being said, I think maybe he might be going back to, the pendulum might be going back to what he originally said.
[01:53:52.165 --> 01:53:56.732]  So, I want to give the guy a shot, but I've got to tell you something.
[01:53:56.752 --> 01:54:00.778]  There are people right now whose anti-Trump message is, to put it mildly,
[01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:02.868]  Breathtakingly incoherent.
[01:54:03.289 --> 01:54:04.049]  I don't know what it is.
[01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:07.750]  I don't know what they're... What do you want?
[01:54:08.230 --> 01:54:08.830]  Impeach him.
[01:54:09.391 --> 01:54:09.851]  Why?
[01:54:10.551 --> 01:54:10.811]  What?
[01:54:11.051 --> 01:54:12.271]  High crimes ministers.
[01:54:12.912 --> 01:54:13.532]  What did he do?
[01:54:13.972 --> 01:54:14.532]  Tell me.
[01:54:15.292 --> 01:54:15.733]  You know.
[01:54:15.753 --> 01:54:17.613]  He hacked the election with the Russians.
[01:54:17.893 --> 01:54:19.134]  Yeah, he worked with the Russians.
[01:54:19.154 --> 01:54:20.194]  We got a dossier.
[01:54:20.214 --> 01:54:23.735]  We got all this fake evidence that when we asked to produce it, we don't have it.
[01:54:24.055 --> 01:54:25.636]  You know, that's what we have against Trump.
[01:54:26.316 --> 01:54:29.057]  And they're, you know, they really are fighting him, not giving him a chance.
[01:54:30.248 --> 01:54:32.790]  To succeed, so it'll be interesting to see what happens with this healthcare thing.
[01:54:32.830 --> 01:54:37.333]  Maybe he keeps putting up these duds so that Obamacare eventually does implode.
[01:54:37.353 --> 01:54:47.701]  I mean, it just came out from Jerome Corsi that Obama was taking the profits from Freddie Mac and putting it into Obamacare.
[01:54:47.761 --> 01:54:50.843]  I think that's a huge scandal that you're not going to hear the mainstream media talk about.
[01:54:51.784 --> 01:54:53.285]  Are you hearing that over in your circles?
[01:54:55.067 --> 01:54:55.867]  Indeed.
[01:54:56.287 --> 01:54:57.769]  Let me tell you one thing about the mainstream media.
[01:54:58.469 --> 01:54:59.350]  Right over here,
[01:55:00.554 --> 01:55:08.377]  I'm pointing in a direction which means nothing, but we have CNN, Columbus Circle, right there, Time Warner.
[01:55:08.938 --> 01:55:12.999]  And then a little bit over here, we've got ABC, CBS down there on 57th Street.
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:14.720]  So I'm right here in this hub.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:21.083]  And there was a time in this country where we thought, well, there might have been a little bias.
[01:55:21.183 --> 01:55:24.144]  There might have been, you know, CBS, they always thought Cronkite was a lefty.
[01:55:24.464 --> 01:55:28.026]  Well, Cronkite, when he came out against the Vietnam War, against the Tet Offensive in
[01:55:29.105 --> 01:55:32.948]  And LBJ purportedly said, when I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America.
[01:55:33.208 --> 01:55:34.209]  That that meant something.
[01:55:34.449 --> 01:55:37.471]  I mean, he really he was a serious you.
[01:55:37.731 --> 01:55:42.535]  A lot of younger folks just do not understand the power he had.
[01:55:42.595 --> 01:55:44.096]  I mean, he really was the most.
[01:55:44.196 --> 01:55:49.340]  And you kind of suspected he might have been, for lack of a better word, leftist.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:50.281]  But he never showed it.
[01:55:50.321 --> 01:55:51.762]  Never today.
[01:55:52.842 --> 01:55:55.244]  They are, this is propaganda machines.
[01:55:55.284 --> 01:56:00.869]  They are the classic Tass and Pravda that everybody thinks the Russian press is.
[01:56:01.229 --> 01:56:02.150]  This is what CNN is.
[01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:07.575]  These are the first, the first firewalls that basically are repeaters and not reporters.
[01:56:07.855 --> 01:56:15.842]  They take the information from, they used to take it from Barack Obama, the administration, but now they're taking it from others, the anti-Trump movement.
[01:56:15.882 --> 01:56:16.463]  Media matters.
[01:56:21.782 --> 01:56:22.102]  They are.
[01:56:22.162 --> 01:56:24.645]  They put something out and then the next day, boom, boom, boom.
[01:56:24.665 --> 01:56:25.966]  It's in every publication.
[01:56:26.366 --> 01:56:27.528]  Almost with the same headline.
[01:56:27.548 --> 01:56:39.439]  An interesting thing I've noticed is all these publications in the mainstream media, every time they mention Alex Jones, they will put the same little block of text saying, oh, Sandy Hook and 9-11 and blah, blah, blah.
[01:56:39.499 --> 01:56:40.801]  And he said this and that and this and that.
[01:56:41.201 --> 01:56:42.662]  They all copy and paste the same thing.
[01:56:42.702 --> 01:56:44.863]  And I think Media Matters is the one that started all of this.
[01:56:45.243 --> 01:56:46.504]  They all get their talking points from there.
[01:56:46.524 --> 01:56:51.487]  So it's like, alright, every time we bring his name up, we have to slander him and, you know, put out this fake news about him.
[01:56:51.847 --> 01:56:56.330]  That's why I think Huffington Post says Trump is a racist, sexist, xenophobe at the end of every article.
[01:56:56.490 --> 01:56:58.751]  They've been doing that since this time last year.
[01:56:58.871 --> 01:56:59.031]  Yeah.
[01:57:00.432 --> 01:57:07.596]  Well, you know, Center for American Progress was another one that, that was, I mean, this was a, it was a great, it was a great narrative.
[01:57:08.314 --> 01:57:10.075]  But, you know, let's talk about Alex for a moment.
[01:57:10.275 --> 01:57:13.517]  First, my favorite was recently.
[01:57:13.537 --> 01:57:15.118]  You see, how do I say this?
[01:57:15.538 --> 01:57:18.840]  And I told us and I hope Alex doesn't take this the wrong way or you for that matter.
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:20.701]  I'm saying you don't understand something.
[01:57:21.602 --> 01:57:23.403]  Alex Jones thrives.
[01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.644]  His oxygen is attention.
[01:57:25.744 --> 01:57:28.546]  You give him attention and he wins because
[01:57:31.976 --> 01:57:34.956]  You know, sometimes when you want to put out a fire, you deprive it of oxygen.
[01:57:35.036 --> 01:57:35.896]  You just smother it.
[01:57:35.916 --> 01:57:36.976]  You don't put water on it.
[01:57:37.016 --> 01:57:38.077]  It makes it worse.
[01:57:38.417 --> 01:57:39.957]  It kind of goes away.
[01:57:40.597 --> 01:57:43.958]  Every time you do this, every time people say, there's that name again.
[01:57:44.238 --> 01:57:44.918]  What did he do this?
[01:57:45.018 --> 01:57:46.058]  I'm going to check him out.
[01:57:46.618 --> 01:57:55.180]  By the way, his press conference of the day after his family court thing was, I mean, I thought, this is a press conference.
[01:57:57.028 --> 01:57:58.408]  You want people to watch a press conference?
[01:57:58.428 --> 01:57:59.448]  Do it like that!
[01:57:59.488 --> 01:58:07.270]  He grabbed the phone, he grabbed the live Facebook mentions camera, and he turned it on the mainstream media, and he was calling them out right then, and he's like, oh you're laughing, you think it's funny.
[01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:12.291]  Laughing about half-species chimeras, and the guy's like, oh, I don't know.
[01:58:12.531 --> 01:58:14.131]  Google it, yeah.
[01:58:14.151 --> 01:58:14.211]  U.S.
[01:58:14.291 --> 01:58:15.712]  Research Farms, it's from the MIT.
[01:58:16.792 --> 01:58:21.913]  But it was so good though, and also it was so, it seemed almost like it was from a movie.
[01:58:22.503 --> 01:58:23.283]  It seemed rehearsed.
[01:58:23.343 --> 01:58:24.064]  It was that good.
[01:58:24.524 --> 01:58:24.904]  Nothing.
[01:58:25.324 --> 01:58:35.909]  I mean, when you go through this, when you go through the facts as it was, and also when somebody said, well, he's an actor, he's an actor.
[01:58:36.049 --> 01:58:40.191]  You know, this reminds me years ago when Vince McMahon
[01:58:42.327 --> 01:58:47.892]  Vince McMahon went to, they were going to try to call wrestling a sport.
[01:58:48.412 --> 01:58:52.015]  And with that came licensing and insurance, and it would have cost him a lot of money.
[01:58:52.295 --> 01:58:58.180]  So basically, Vince McMahon said, he basically broke kayfabe, as we say, and he said, no, it's entertainment.
[01:58:58.641 --> 01:59:02.024]  It's not, it's not, you know, it's not whatever it is.
[01:59:02.304 --> 01:59:04.666]  Now, people said, aha!
[01:59:06.059 --> 01:59:06.359]  Uh-huh.
[01:59:07.059 --> 01:59:07.459]  Uh-huh.
[01:59:07.719 --> 01:59:09.900]  You know what happened to wrestling after the uh-huh moment?
[01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:11.200]  It didn't matter.
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:12.481]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[01:59:13.081 --> 01:59:23.984]  If Alex Jones came out, or you, and said, you know, I'm really upset about this Obamacare, and I really think that... It's gone.
[01:59:24.664 --> 01:59:24.844]  Yeah.
[01:59:24.884 --> 01:59:25.644]  He comes across.
[01:59:25.864 --> 01:59:26.925]  Al Fire and Brimstone.
[01:59:27.005 --> 01:59:31.866]  He's Elmer Gantry meets whatever it is.
[01:59:32.026 --> 01:59:32.886]  It's a style.
[01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:34.307]  I don't care what it is.
[01:59:34.507 --> 01:59:35.067]  It works.
[01:59:35.828 --> 01:59:36.529]  You can't.
[01:59:38.110 --> 01:59:39.651]  He's broken the trance of a lot of people.
[01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:40.412]  I'll tell you what.
[01:59:41.033 --> 01:59:42.274]  A lot of people have been woken up.
[01:59:42.334 --> 01:59:46.677]  Maybe they've gone on to do different things, but they all started and the common ground was Alex Jones.
[01:59:46.737 --> 01:59:49.920]  If you look at the number of people that have been affected by what he said.
[01:59:50.261 --> 01:59:51.922]  Now Lionel, we're past our time.
[01:59:51.942 --> 01:59:53.503]  I gotta throw it over to David Knight.
[01:59:53.924 --> 01:59:56.906]  Where can people find out more about you and your shows?
[01:59:56.946 --> 01:59:57.587]  When are you on the air?
[01:59:59.167 --> 02:00:01.469]  The best is my YouTube channel.
[02:00:01.689 --> 02:00:04.832]  My YouTube channel is LionelNation.
[02:00:05.152 --> 02:00:08.555]  I'm on Twitter at LionelMedia and LionelMedia.com.
[02:00:08.915 --> 02:00:11.077]  And it was, gentlemen, a pleasure to be with you.
[02:00:11.137 --> 02:00:13.739]  And anything I can do for the cause, you let me know.
[02:00:13.839 --> 02:00:14.320]  I'll be here.
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:15.020]  Excellent.
[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:16.601]  Thank you for standing up for free speech.
[02:00:17.081 --> 02:00:18.162]  That is what it's all about.
[02:00:18.202 --> 02:00:20.262]  If we don't stand up for free speech, nobody will.
[02:00:20.582 --> 02:00:22.203]  And we've seen what the left wants.
[02:00:22.243 --> 02:00:28.026]  They don't want free speech because they think anything that is free speech to them that doesn't agree with them is hate speech.
[02:00:28.106 --> 02:00:29.606]  Anyone who disagrees is a Nazi.
[02:00:29.926 --> 02:00:30.507]  Exactly.
[02:00:30.567 --> 02:00:33.108]  So we're going to throw it over to David Knight here after this short break.
[02:00:33.128 --> 02:00:35.789]  Thank you for joining myself, Rob Dew, and Michael Zimmerman.

[02:02:12.932 --> 02:02:13.312]  Great!
[02:02:13.392 --> 02:02:14.393]  Hey, thank you so much.

[02:02:28.344 --> 02:02:29.085]  Wow, thank you.
[02:02:29.105 --> 02:02:31.507]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[02:02:31.587 --> 02:02:33.148]  Which nutraceutical do you like best?
[02:02:33.388 --> 02:02:36.729]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:02:36.749 --> 02:02:37.910]  That's really incredible.
[02:02:38.130 --> 02:02:41.171]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:02:41.191 --> 02:02:42.451]  Like, I haven't felt asleep.
[02:02:42.551 --> 02:02:44.132]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:02:44.212 --> 02:02:45.332]  And I love you guys.
[02:02:45.352 --> 02:02:46.953]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[02:02:47.613 --> 02:02:54.316]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[02:02:54.476 --> 02:02:55.256]  You will love it.
[02:02:55.496 --> 02:02:55.956]  I'm telling you.
[02:02:55.996 --> 02:02:57.337]  I've never bought a bad product.
[02:02:57.637 --> 02:03:02.033]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:03:02.073 --> 02:03:03.739]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.

[02:03:36.931 --> 02:03:46.892]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:03:47.132 --> 02:03:49.113]  And this part is most important.

[02:04:06.717 --> 02:04:11.078]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:04:11.178 --> 02:04:22.121]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:04:22.281 --> 02:04:27.223]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:04:27.323 --> 02:04:29.844]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:04:29.904 --> 02:04:31.405]  It helps detoxify.
[02:04:31.625 --> 02:04:34.466]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:04:34.506 --> 02:04:39.248]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:04:39.268 --> 02:04:45.511]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:04:45.551 --> 02:04:50.834]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:04:50.854 --> 02:04:51.634]  I'm taking it now.
[02:04:51.974 --> 02:04:52.334]  We're good.
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:21.421]  I joke around a lot on the air.
[02:05:21.581 --> 02:05:22.501]  I try to have a good time.
[02:05:23.121 --> 02:05:24.282]  I'm a happy person overall.
[02:05:25.142 --> 02:05:32.704]  But I have intellectually studied the globalist program and I understand it is a major threat to myself and my family and your family as well.
[02:05:33.725 --> 02:05:38.446]  Now we do have some gallows humor around here, but when you get down to the bedrock of our message, it's dire.
[02:05:39.446 --> 02:05:42.307]  Globalism is an anti-human system.
[02:05:42.567 --> 02:05:43.948]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[02:05:45.031 --> 02:05:56.083]  The elites believe humanity's finished and are basically stealing our wealth, our intellectual property, and our very essence to construct their new world order system.
[02:05:57.204 --> 02:06:00.728]  Now I never started InfoWars 22 years ago believing I would save the world.
[02:06:01.008 --> 02:06:02.470]  I just wanted to be a watchman on the wall
[02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:11.053]  A modern Paul Revere who could warn people about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[02:06:11.693 --> 02:06:16.876]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[02:06:17.457 --> 02:06:27.062]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[02:06:27.702 --> 02:06:34.931]  Wednesday, May 3rd, and Thursday, May 4th, we're doing a 30-hour transmission that kicked off at 11 a.m.
[02:06:35.351 --> 02:06:35.852]  on Wednesday.
[02:06:36.893 --> 02:06:41.558]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[02:06:42.239 --> 02:06:47.686]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[02:06:48.306 --> 02:06:59.735]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news but have not actually heard the message.
[02:07:00.556 --> 02:07:02.737]  Tell people this is the forbidden message.
[02:07:03.078 --> 02:07:04.719]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[02:07:04.739 --> 02:07:07.181]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[02:07:07.581 --> 02:07:12.565]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host's character.
[02:07:12.825 --> 02:07:17.709]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society, goodwill.
[02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:21.010]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:25.172]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[02:07:25.212 --> 02:07:25.753]  That's the goal.
[02:07:25.893 --> 02:07:28.014]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[02:07:28.094 --> 02:07:28.294]  No.
[02:07:28.734 --> 02:07:34.317]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[02:07:34.818 --> 02:07:38.780]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:39.900]  Thank you.
[02:07:54.557 --> 02:07:57.419]  And also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[02:07:57.759 --> 02:08:08.146]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[02:08:08.646 --> 02:08:23.236]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high-quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[02:08:23.696 --> 02:08:28.357]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[02:08:28.657 --> 02:08:34.098]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private labeled at lower prices.
[02:08:34.118 --> 02:08:35.798]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[02:08:36.059 --> 02:08:42.300]  And many of which have developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers, like Knockout, our amazing sleep aid.
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:52.922]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[02:08:53.382 --> 02:08:55.964]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[02:08:56.444 --> 02:08:59.426]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[02:08:59.807 --> 02:09:06.351]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[02:09:07.532 --> 02:09:12.415]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[02:09:12.776 --> 02:09:14.637]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[02:09:14.717 --> 02:09:15.517]  They see the lies.
[02:09:15.858 --> 02:09:16.958]  They see the demonization.
[02:09:17.739 --> 02:09:21.742]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:23.168 --> 02:09:31.994]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[02:09:32.374 --> 02:09:43.342]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[02:09:43.782 --> 02:09:48.945]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:09:50.186 --> 02:09:53.509]  On hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products that's a win-win.
[02:09:53.650 --> 02:09:58.755]  Products you need, products that fund our operation, so that we can then expose the globalist program.
[02:09:58.855 --> 02:10:00.756]  It's a total 360 win.
[02:10:00.777 --> 02:10:03.900]  A limited time, DNA Force is now back in stock.
[02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:09.545]  We have the Defend Free Speech Mega Special, getting Brain Force, our best-selling nootropic for 30% off.
[02:10:10.526 --> 02:10:12.408]  We have Secret 12 at 20% off.
[02:10:12.748 --> 02:10:15.611]  We have Living Defense, a parasite cleanse, 20% off.
[02:10:15.892 --> 02:10:18.795]  Biome Defense, our great probiotic, 25% off.
[02:10:19.195 --> 02:10:22.118]  Bio PCA for skin and nails, top formula.
[02:10:22.418 --> 02:10:26.122]  Other formulas that are similar cost 60, 70 bucks, two, three times what ours does.
[02:10:26.423 --> 02:10:28.265]  Prostagard, incredible formula.
[02:10:28.725 --> 02:10:32.729]  Winter Sun, the knockout that I mentioned, and so many other great products.
[02:10:32.789 --> 02:10:33.410]  And then finally,
[02:10:33.550 --> 02:10:34.330]  Let me see if it's still here.
[02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.731]  It is.
[02:10:35.111 --> 02:10:37.592]  This just came back in after two months being sold out.
[02:10:38.032 --> 02:10:41.294]  Super blue, high-quality, organic toothpaste.
[02:10:42.034 --> 02:10:47.037]  Fluoride-free, with iodine, with colloidal silver, with tea tree oil and peppermint oil.
[02:10:47.377 --> 02:10:48.277]  It's concentrated.
[02:10:48.337 --> 02:10:51.159]  My dad is a quasi-retired dentist, oral surgeon.
[02:10:51.399 --> 02:10:54.580]  He helped develop this with one of the biggest manufacturers in the country.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:55.401]  It's amazing.
[02:10:55.801 --> 02:10:59.422]  And again, when you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off.
[02:10:59.523 --> 02:11:00.063]  It's a win-win.
[02:11:00.603 --> 02:11:04.486]  You remember to support us each month, or every two months, or every three months, however you sign up.
[02:11:04.887 --> 02:11:15.835]  You can cancel anytime, and you can get 10% off, and then don't have to remember to keep supporting us, and also get the products that obviously run out, that you've got to replenish.
[02:11:16.076 --> 02:11:17.617]  These are great renewable resources.
[02:11:17.937 --> 02:11:19.058]  Please continue to support us.
[02:11:19.138 --> 02:11:21.620]  Again, I want to defeat the globalists.
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:22.341]  I'm determined.
[02:11:22.421 --> 02:11:22.961]  I'm focused.
[02:11:23.482 --> 02:11:28.426]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us, and without you praying for us,
[02:11:29.926 --> 02:11:31.374]  We don't have a chance in hell.
[02:11:31.797 --> 02:11:33.587]  But if you get behind us like you've already done...
[02:11:35.233 --> 02:11:36.154]  Turn it up a notch?
[02:11:36.834 --> 02:11:40.357]  We are unstoppable, ladies and gentlemen, because humans want freedom.
[02:11:40.697 --> 02:11:42.979]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[02:11:43.219 --> 02:11:44.400]  We want to go to the stars.
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:46.041]  Look how far we've already come.
[02:11:46.301 --> 02:11:48.042]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[02:11:48.323 --> 02:11:51.325]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[02:11:51.605 --> 02:11:54.627]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[02:11:54.927 --> 02:11:59.131]  Let's tell Ted Turner, who could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[02:11:59.431 --> 02:12:00.672]  And let's take action.
[02:12:01.192 --> 02:12:09.298]  There's nowhere you can spend your hard-earned money to get better products and then make sure that money goes to a good cause than InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:12:09.538 --> 02:12:10.859]  But regardless of what you do...
[02:12:11.875 --> 02:12:22.381]  Spread the links, spread the articles, and let people know about this 30-hour special broadcast so new people tune in and learn about the nightly news, the daily show I do, and the news sites and everything we're engaged in.
[02:12:22.421 --> 02:12:27.784]  Because we're not perfect, but our hearts are in the right place and we are pulling as hard as we can for victory.
[02:12:28.244 --> 02:12:36.608]  Now back to the live transmission with the amazing host and guest and special reports during the 30-hour broadcast that we're now partway into.
[02:12:36.989 --> 02:12:39.430]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:40.991]  Please spread that link.
[02:12:48.587 --> 02:12:52.691]  All right, as you just heard, we are in the midst of our 30-hour live broadcast.
[02:12:53.072 --> 02:12:56.756]  I'm David Knight, and we're here live a little after 9 a.m.
[02:12:56.996 --> 02:12:57.797]  on May the 4th.
[02:12:57.957 --> 02:12:59.779]  Let me be the first one to say May the 4th be with you.
[02:12:59.799 --> 02:13:01.261]  I'm sure you've heard that a zillion times today.
[02:13:01.281 --> 02:13:02.462]  Of course, it's my son's birthday.
[02:13:03.443 --> 02:13:04.384]  Happy birthday, Lance.
[02:13:06.446 --> 02:13:09.027]  That's been a running joke in our family for a long time.
[02:13:09.387 --> 02:13:14.329]  Usually there's some great movie that comes out, some big blockbuster movie, and this year is no exception.
[02:13:14.349 --> 02:13:17.070]  They always put one out on May the 4th or 5th, whatever.
[02:13:17.670 --> 02:13:24.053]  And there's congratulations to Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the new happy, engaged couple.
[02:13:24.873 --> 02:13:30.778]  As they point out on page six, they are the first couple of cable news, the king and queen.
[02:13:30.798 --> 02:13:31.619]  There you go.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:40.407]  And I guess maybe at this point we could ask if she could get equal billing, because it's been the Morning Joe Show for a very long time.
[02:13:40.447 --> 02:13:43.550]  I mean, how misogynistic and male chauvinistic is that?
[02:13:44.150 --> 02:13:48.432]  That you have this feminist on there with Joe Scarborough, and she doesn't even get equal billing.
[02:13:48.472 --> 02:13:52.915]  I mean, her dad was basically running the Carter White House.
[02:13:53.555 --> 02:13:56.196]  He was the guy who created the Trilateral Commission.
[02:13:56.236 --> 02:14:06.742]  He came up with a whole technocratic, globalist, tyranny ideas that we're now seeing as part of the TPP, the TTIP, and these other trade agreements, these consolidations.
[02:14:06.782 --> 02:14:09.983]  I mean, that's basically his plan that's being rolled out there.
[02:14:10.243 --> 02:14:12.445]  And so Mika is pushing that, and so is Joe.
[02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:21.812]  Along with her, we're told that Joe got down on one knee and proposed to her at the scenic Bar Bellini in Monaco.
[02:14:21.892 --> 02:14:22.633]  Isn't that wonderful?
[02:14:22.693 --> 02:14:25.375]  The life of the rich and famous, you know?
[02:14:26.436 --> 02:14:29.658]  Maybe what they can do, I got a suggestion for your, the name of your show.
[02:14:29.918 --> 02:14:35.163]  You should give Mika some equal credit here and not just have this be Morning Joe.
[02:14:35.263 --> 02:14:36.624]  You don't even mention that she's there.
[02:14:37.224 --> 02:14:38.645]  Call it the Scarborough Fair.
[02:14:39.605 --> 02:14:47.210]  Because this is what everybody was talking about, especially since last June, when it came out that she was getting divorced.
[02:14:48.150 --> 02:14:49.131]  She got divorced last June.
[02:14:49.171 --> 02:14:51.712]  He had divorced his wife in 2013.
[02:14:51.792 --> 02:14:54.394]  Everybody at NBC said they knew they were a couple.
[02:14:54.914 --> 02:14:57.636]  So this is something that's been going on for a very long time.
[02:14:58.296 --> 02:15:02.078]  And there's even a more interesting backstory about Joe Scarborough that you may not know.
[02:15:02.679 --> 02:15:04.420]  Other women in his life, one of them,
[02:15:05.199 --> 02:15:06.620]  Who is working at his office.
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:11.505]  Her name is Lori Klausutis, if I'm pronouncing her last name correctly.
[02:15:11.525 --> 02:15:13.126]  There's an article from Daily Cause.
[02:15:13.166 --> 02:15:14.547]  What really happened to Lori?
[02:15:14.968 --> 02:15:18.091]  Everything Joe Scarborough does not want his viewers to know.
[02:15:18.911 --> 02:15:21.133]  They say this past June, there was a media frenzy.
[02:15:21.153 --> 02:15:26.098]  Of course, they wrote this article before the announcement of the blessed event that is about to happen.
[02:15:27.018 --> 02:15:29.301]  But at that time, it was just a Scarborough affair.
[02:15:30.330 --> 02:15:50.857]  But in June, as everybody was talking about the divorce, they said there's one thing that you may not know about him, and that was after he got elected as a congressman in Florida's 1st Congressional District in 1995, he suddenly resigned only five months into his fourth term in September 2001.
[02:15:51.517 --> 02:15:53.558]  So he runs for re-election.
[02:15:54.258 --> 02:16:01.305]  He gets re-elected for his fourth term, and he only serves for five months, and he says, well, I want to spend more time with my children.
[02:16:02.166 --> 02:16:03.888]  Which is why he later got divorced, I guess.
[02:16:04.349 --> 02:16:08.813]  But that was just two months before something else had happened.
[02:16:09.622 --> 02:16:11.545]  That it didn't have anything to do with his children.
[02:16:11.905 --> 02:16:19.075]  It had to do with the fact that Laurie, who's a 28-year-old office worker for him, was found dead in his congressional office.
[02:16:19.676 --> 02:16:25.304]  That might have had a little bit more to do with it than this usual story that he wants to spend more time with his children.
[02:16:25.945 --> 02:16:33.054]  Now, interestingly enough, the police said that they showed no foul play nor any other outward indication of suicide.
[02:16:33.454 --> 02:16:41.024]  But the question remains as to why there was a virtual news blackout of this mysterious death.
[02:16:42.145 --> 02:16:44.308]  At the time, The Daily Cause points out,
[02:16:45.579 --> 02:16:47.960]  Everybody was on top of U.S.
[02:16:48.561 --> 02:16:53.603]  Congressman Gary Condit about the missing ex-intern Chandra Levy.
[02:16:54.023 --> 02:16:55.284]  You probably remember her name, don't you?
[02:16:56.104 --> 02:17:03.908]  I heard nothing at all about the dead office worker that was found in Joe Scarborough's office.
[02:17:04.008 --> 02:17:05.869]  I don't even know how to pronounce her name accurately.
[02:17:06.129 --> 02:17:12.431]  But everybody knows how to pronounce Chandra Levy's name because we heard about that incessantly.
[02:17:13.011 --> 02:17:20.234]  But we never heard anything about Joe's healthy 28-year-old intern who was found dead in his office.
[02:17:21.014 --> 02:17:23.555]  And they say it's kind of interesting because
[02:17:24.918 --> 02:17:30.361]  One of the things that helped was that two days after this happened, we had September 11th, 2001.
[02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:34.264]  And so that kind of helped to cover the story.
[02:17:34.624 --> 02:17:42.048]  The other thing that happened with it was the medical examiner, Dr. Michael Birkeland, his autopsy was kind of suspicious.
[02:17:42.088 --> 02:17:43.689]  And this is a guy who was a pathologist.
[02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:47.852]  He had his medical license in the state of Missouri, had been revoked in 1998.
[02:17:48.072 --> 02:17:54.036]  The Daily Caller reports, as a result of him reporting false information regarding brain tissue samples,
[02:17:54.836 --> 02:17:57.038]  In a 1996 autopsy report.
[02:17:57.398 --> 02:18:05.664]  He never denied those charges, but then he moves to Florida the next year, and he gets suspended from his position as medical examiner in the state of Florida.
[02:18:05.704 --> 02:18:14.290]  Yet in 2001, he is the one who is issuing the reports on the dead intern that was found in Joe Scarborough's congressional office.
[02:18:15.531 --> 02:18:19.033]  Two months before he decided to spend more time with his children.
[02:18:19.834 --> 02:18:21.175]  Two days before September 11th.
[02:18:22.428 --> 02:18:25.909]  He also continued this medical examiner, continued to get into trouble.
[02:18:25.949 --> 02:18:30.130]  In 2003, he was fired and he finally had his license withdrawn as a medical examiner.
[02:18:30.511 --> 02:18:36.472]  In 2012, he was arrested and charged when they found that he was storing human body parts in a storage unit.
[02:18:37.032 --> 02:18:40.513]  Yeah, this guy... Amazing.
[02:18:40.554 --> 02:18:43.654]  But anyway, this is the guy who said there was no foul play.
[02:18:44.195 --> 02:18:44.915]  So we can believe him.
[02:18:45.695 --> 02:18:49.657]  Now, they say there's several questions that have not been adequately answered.
[02:18:49.677 --> 02:18:50.437]  This is Daily Cause.
[02:18:50.457 --> 02:19:09.085]  They say, one, if Lori's death was just a simple accident, then why did the representative and his spokesman, Scarborough, why did he and his spokesman feel the need to go to two different local TV stations within three hours of her body's being found and invent a non-existent history of chronical medical conditions for her?
[02:19:10.069 --> 02:19:13.051]  In other words, why do they feel the need to lie about her health?
[02:19:13.151 --> 02:19:23.779]  Number two, would you trust without question the word of a medical examiner who lost his license in two separate states because he lied about autopsy work and results?
[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:35.067]  And why should whoever wrote her obituary feel that it was appropriate to talk about everything in her life except the fact that she worked for Congressman Scarborough, where she was found dead in his office?
[02:19:35.348 --> 02:19:38.070]  That was something that they omitted out of her obituary.
[02:19:38.650 --> 02:19:48.512]  And finally, they say, Dr. Birkland and his supervisor at the time, Dr. Gary Cumberland, were known to be high giving donors to Scarborough's congressional campaigns.
[02:19:48.972 --> 02:19:51.672]  Well, that, I wonder, just coincidence.
[02:19:52.012 --> 02:19:55.573]  Sure had nothing to do with why he was chosen to do the autopsy report.
[02:19:56.113 --> 02:19:59.754]  Did their relationship influence these results that were issued by them?
[02:19:59.794 --> 02:20:05.915]  And of course, they point out this young woman, Laurie, was a smart and loving young woman whose life ended way too soon.
[02:20:06.075 --> 02:20:07.455]  Doesn't she deserve justice?
[02:20:08.564 --> 02:20:09.565]  Yeah, I think she does.
[02:20:09.985 --> 02:20:19.049]  But as we see that the happy couple, Joe and Mika, the happy globalist couple, are tying the knot, we see that viewers are cutting the cord.
[02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:22.431]  And we have a story up on Drudge Report today.
[02:20:22.931 --> 02:20:27.174]  Cord cutting spikes five-fold in cable TV's worst quarter ever.
[02:20:27.234 --> 02:20:33.297]  So they may be the queen and king of cable, but the viewers are disconnecting.
[02:20:34.057 --> 02:20:35.018]  They're cutting the cord.
[02:20:36.072 --> 02:20:42.337]  Cable's day of reckoning has come, says Fast Company, with all the major cable and satellite companies having reported their quarterly numbers.
[02:20:43.177 --> 02:20:45.659]  Analysts are saying that things are very bad.
[02:20:45.799 --> 02:20:55.346]  Pay TV providers lost an estimated 762,000 pay-per-TV-cut subscribers over just the first three months of this year.
[02:20:55.886 --> 02:21:00.450]  And usually, that has been their strongest season for pay TV.
[02:21:01.090 --> 02:21:04.813]  So they are crashing on that, and entertainment stocks are tumbling.
[02:21:05.413 --> 02:21:08.959]  They have a Hollywood reporter is saying that media stocks got crushed yesterday.
[02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:15.990]  Time Warner earnings beat Wall Street expectations, but Turner TV's network advertising revenue disappointed.
[02:21:16.431 --> 02:21:16.711]  They say...
[02:21:17.935 --> 02:21:24.179]  Netflix and Hulu are giving them competition in entertainment, and I think they're losing it on news as well.
[02:21:24.219 --> 02:21:25.400]  Haven't they lost their credibility?
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:26.561]  Isn't that what we all know?
[02:21:26.681 --> 02:21:29.003]  Isn't that why we're having our ads cut?
[02:21:29.523 --> 02:21:36.068]  They can't cut our viewers, so they try to cut our funding in terms of our ability to serve ads on the Internet.
[02:21:36.886 --> 02:21:38.948]  The Internet is where people are going for news.
[02:21:39.148 --> 02:21:41.450]  They're going there for information, for entertainment.
[02:21:42.010 --> 02:21:44.252]  That's why they're subscribing to Netflix, to Hulu.
[02:21:44.592 --> 02:21:52.038]  That's why they listen to InfoWars, because it's more immediate and they can get a wider selection of information there.
[02:21:52.078 --> 02:21:53.379]  So we're seeing Viacom is down 7.3%.
[02:21:53.419 --> 02:21:55.020]  We saw 21st Century Fox stocks down 5%.
[02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:56.761]  This is the change that we're seeing everywhere.
[02:22:05.253 --> 02:22:06.538]  Let's see, where should I go next?
[02:22:06.578 --> 02:22:08.386]  We've got the District of Criminals.
[02:22:09.847 --> 02:22:16.653]  More information is breaking on a daily basis about Jared Kushner's dealings with George Soros.
[02:22:17.714 --> 02:22:29.223]  And the author who wrote Clinton Cash, Peter Schweitzer, is quoted on Daily Caller as well as Breitbart saying, this is very serious.
[02:22:29.523 --> 02:22:38.351]  Not only is it serious that he has this kind of partnership, but it is also very serious that he has failed to disclose this information.
[02:22:39.124 --> 02:22:40.746]  That's one of the reasons that you have disclosure.
[02:22:41.767 --> 02:22:44.209]  You want to know who has influence with somebody.
[02:22:44.249 --> 02:22:50.956]  So when they don't file that, that is not only a major ethical issue, it is a major legal issue.
[02:22:51.056 --> 02:22:52.317]  It's like committing perjury.
[02:22:52.377 --> 02:22:56.982]  You can be deposed about something that is kind of a minor offense, right?
[02:22:57.102 --> 02:22:58.483]  But if you commit perjury,
[02:22:59.204 --> 02:23:03.227]  Then that in and of itself is a very serious crime.
[02:23:03.287 --> 02:23:06.230]  We had Hillary Clinton very concerned about that.
[02:23:06.250 --> 02:23:18.339]  That's one of the reasons why I believe you had Bill Clinton meeting on the tarmac with Loretta Lynch working out what's going to be asked, I think, is what they were doing in that meeting.
[02:23:18.859 --> 02:23:23.903]  Working out what was going to be asked so that Hillary Clinton could give very precise answers
[02:23:25.006 --> 02:23:26.529]  And make sure that she didn't perjure herself.
[02:23:26.869 --> 02:23:27.470]  What do they know?
[02:23:28.532 --> 02:23:31.076]  How can we spend this so that they don't commit perjury?
[02:23:31.277 --> 02:23:34.121]  I mean, remember, Bill Clinton had been down this road before.
[02:23:35.643 --> 02:23:49.013]  They had been given, essentially, a pass by Ken Starr, who, even though Bill Clinton had faced allegations of criminal sexual assault, he had faced allegations of rape, and still does.
[02:23:49.433 --> 02:23:52.555]  We still have women who accuse him of both of those serious crimes.
[02:23:52.996 --> 02:23:54.277]  What did Ken Starr focus on?
[02:23:55.057 --> 02:24:00.187]  He focused on a consensual relationship between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
[02:24:00.708 --> 02:24:02.712]  And yet, even then, that's not a crime.
[02:24:03.353 --> 02:24:04.535]  Sexual assault is a crime.
[02:24:04.695 --> 02:24:05.617]  Ken Starr didn't want to do that.
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:07.501]  The rapes are crime.
[02:24:07.541 --> 02:24:08.481]  Ken Starr didn't want to do that.
[02:24:08.501 --> 02:24:23.908]  And, of course, Ken Starr was later the defense attorney for Phil Epstein, the guy who had the pedophile issues and the Lolita flights and the Pleasure Island that he had set up.
[02:24:24.489 --> 02:24:27.550]  Ken Starr defended that guy later, after defending Bill Clinton.
[02:24:28.090 --> 02:24:33.313]  And then he became president of a Christian college, Baylor University, and he defended
[02:24:34.502 --> 02:24:39.846]  The accusations, the allegations that the football team there had been engaged in multiple rapes.
[02:24:39.946 --> 02:24:48.852]  So he has a long history of doing these things, but basically I think at this point it's been three strikes and you're out for Ken Starr.
[02:24:48.872 --> 02:24:52.314]  But going back to Bill Clinton, the big issue for him was the perjury.
[02:24:53.095 --> 02:24:54.476]  That was what he was impeached for.
[02:24:55.475 --> 02:24:56.195]  Committing perjury.
[02:24:56.215 --> 02:24:58.176]  He was a lawyer, he knew better.
[02:24:58.196 --> 02:25:00.037]  He was a president, he knew better.
[02:25:00.717 --> 02:25:04.499]  And he committed, he lied under oath about something that wasn't even really a serious crime.
[02:25:04.519 --> 02:25:05.459]  It wasn't even a crime!
[02:25:05.559 --> 02:25:09.581]  It wasn't a crime for him to have a consensual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
[02:25:10.161 --> 02:25:12.922]  And that's all that Ken Starr was leaving there for him.
[02:25:13.082 --> 02:25:15.163]  So they had to work that out on the tarmac.
[02:25:15.543 --> 02:25:20.345]  So when you have a situation with Jared Kushner, and he's got a partnership with George Soros,
[02:25:21.963 --> 02:25:22.683]  I don't know.
[02:25:38.010 --> 02:25:39.933]  But he's also the co-founder.
[02:25:40.013 --> 02:25:41.635]  He co-founded it in 2014.
[02:25:42.116 --> 02:25:49.086]  So this is not some passive investment, he said, that one of his advisors said to put money into and that he forgot about.
[02:25:49.867 --> 02:25:51.709]  So why would you not disclose this?
[02:25:53.533 --> 02:25:57.078]  If you are a co-founder, you know this business is there.
[02:25:57.558 --> 02:26:03.727]  You know about these deals that you've set up and this real estate startup.
[02:26:03.847 --> 02:26:05.589]  You know where you got your financing from.
[02:26:05.669 --> 02:26:07.672]  Why would you not disclose that?
[02:26:08.473 --> 02:26:19.276]  Well, clearly, you wouldn't want to disclose it if you were connected to George Soros, because everybody knows how politically active George Soros is, and how he is politically active on the other side.
[02:26:19.596 --> 02:26:21.216]  He says, so that's a massive, massive problem.
[02:26:21.236 --> 02:26:28.898]  The whole purpose of disclosure, whether you're asking the Clintons to do it, whether you're asking Obama to do it, or Jared Kushner or Mitch McConnell to do it,
[02:26:29.478 --> 02:26:38.725]  Is so the American people can know who are they financially dependent upon, who do they have ties to, who might have leverage over them.
[02:26:40.966 --> 02:26:46.090]  So that's the problem that we've got here is that the position that Jared Kushner is in,
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:54.286]  Which is a very, very important position because Donald Trump relies on Jared and his daughter extensively, their family.
[02:26:54.326 --> 02:26:55.507]  He believes he can trust them.
[02:26:56.388 --> 02:26:57.849]  Can we trust Jared?
[02:26:58.609 --> 02:27:05.535]  Certainly, I don't trust their political aspirations and their political advice that they've been giving Donald Trump.
[02:27:05.575 --> 02:27:12.200]  I think they've been used by Goldman Sachs and by the globalists to push an agenda that Donald Trump did not run on.
[02:27:12.941 --> 02:27:14.782]  An agenda that he did not win with?
[02:27:15.062 --> 02:27:17.723]  An agenda that his voters don't want to see happen?
[02:27:17.763 --> 02:27:31.530]  And as we were talking about this yesterday with Lee Stranahan, we're saying, if you're a Trump supporter, that means that you support him by telling him, we want you to stick to the agenda that you ran on that we voted for.
[02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:34.231]  Obama asked people to do that.
[02:27:34.251 --> 02:27:36.172]  That's what Lee pointed out yesterday.
[02:27:36.212 --> 02:27:39.734]  He said, look, Obama said, hold my feet to the fire.
[02:27:40.174 --> 02:27:40.694]  Pressure me.
[02:27:40.854 --> 02:27:41.835]  He told that to the voters.
[02:27:42.773 --> 02:27:45.495]  There's a lot of pressure that is being put on Donald Trump from the other side.
[02:27:45.515 --> 02:27:46.335]  Everybody knows that.
[02:27:47.176 --> 02:27:50.258]  So if you are going to sit there and say, well, he's Donald Trump.
[02:27:50.878 --> 02:27:52.679]  I know that he can do this all on his own.
[02:27:52.719 --> 02:27:54.200]  He doesn't need any advice from me.
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:27:55.741]  He doesn't need any encouragement from me.
[02:27:55.761 --> 02:27:57.102]  He doesn't need any pressure from me.
[02:27:57.542 --> 02:27:59.844]  Then understand all the pressure is going to be on the other side.
[02:28:00.244 --> 02:28:03.346]  It's just like you got a boat and everybody's only rowing on one side.
[02:28:03.406 --> 02:28:04.587]  It's going to turn it around, isn't it?
[02:28:05.387 --> 02:28:07.569]  So we have to understand what's going on with that.
[02:28:07.609 --> 02:28:09.870]  I think this is a very serious issue.
[02:28:09.890 --> 02:28:17.255]  I would think that it would be best for the Trump family to just get Jared and Ivanka out of the politics part of this.
[02:28:17.275 --> 02:28:23.139]  Let them live their lives and let us move ahead with the fight against globalism.
[02:28:23.179 --> 02:28:30.684]  Meanwhile, as we talk about other things happening in the District of Criminals, we have the Feds now looking into Bernie Sanders.
[02:28:31.485 --> 02:28:33.506]  Remember this came up briefly in the election.
[02:28:33.546 --> 02:28:42.192]  It would have been a much bigger point, I think, if he had not been sabotaged by the Democrat National Committee and Hillary Clinton.
[02:28:43.272 --> 02:28:48.035]  But now they have people and the FBI that are going down to Florida asking questions.
[02:28:48.075 --> 02:28:56.681]  They say one individual that they talked to found two FBI investigators waiting for him with plenty of questions about a $30,000 donation that he had made to the school.
[02:28:56.721 --> 02:28:57.922]  He said it was kind of strange.
[02:28:58.302 --> 02:28:59.503]  He's one of five people
[02:29:00.143 --> 02:29:12.728]  That are associated with Burlington College that have confirmed to Seven Days, this is the article that I'm reading from here, that they were contacted, interviewed, and in some cases subpoenaed by federal authorities over the past 15 months.
[02:29:13.168 --> 02:29:14.029]  They want documents.
[02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:24.953]  The interviews suggest this is a serious criminal investigation that is focused on a $6.5 million bank loan application the college made in 2010 to pay for a $10 million Lakeside campus.
[02:29:28.103 --> 02:29:30.505]  What is the involvement of Bernie Sanders' wife?
[02:29:30.545 --> 02:29:33.127]  Well, she was the person who signed that application.
[02:29:34.056 --> 02:29:38.577]  The investigation appears to stem from a complaint that was filed January of last year, 2016.
[02:29:39.218 --> 02:29:57.904]  It was filed by a conservative activist, Wendy Wilton, and it alleged that Bernie Sanders' wife committed federal loan fraud by inflating the number of fundraising commitments she had secured to buy the 32-acre North Avenue campus from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington.
[02:29:58.584 --> 02:30:08.486]  When those donations failed to materialize, the college defaulted on loans and it cost the church that financed a portion of the sale between $1.6 million and $2 million.
[02:30:09.666 --> 02:30:15.048]  So they're coming after Bernie Sanders' wife, taking a look at her involvement in that loan.
[02:30:15.068 --> 02:30:20.729]  And of course, when we talk about loan fraud, I can't talk about loan fraud anymore without talking about
[02:30:21.755 --> 02:30:22.796]  Net asset sweep.
[02:30:23.117 --> 02:30:24.518]  We're going to continue talking about this.
[02:30:24.579 --> 02:30:30.806]  We were getting some traction in the mainstream media, but you haven't really seen the kind of coverage that this needs to get.
[02:30:30.846 --> 02:30:35.091]  And of course, Dr. Corsi, Jerome Corsi, our Washington correspondent.
[02:30:36.032 --> 02:30:39.554]  In charge of our DC office, did a lot of investigation into this.
[02:30:39.574 --> 02:30:51.061]  It's now been confirmed by Mnuchin that yes, in fact, they are funding Obamacare's subsidies by stealing money out of the
[02:30:52.442 --> 02:30:55.945]  Uh, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors' funds.
[02:30:56.305 --> 02:30:59.247]  They call it a net asset sweep, but it's simply theft.
[02:30:59.687 --> 02:31:05.732]  It's the same way that Venezuela funds their government, their public spending, by just stealing stuff from people.
[02:31:05.752 --> 02:31:10.095]  They steal automobile factories, they steal oil companies.
[02:31:10.275 --> 02:31:13.777]  In America, we steal the investors who signed up for stuff.
[02:31:13.797 --> 02:31:16.059]  So, as we're looking at this story about Bernie Sanders,
[02:31:16.619 --> 02:31:17.620]  We're good to go.
[02:31:27.287 --> 02:31:35.055]  There is a lawsuit that's going on, and all we have to have from President Trump is to have the Justice Department pull out of protesting that lawsuit.
[02:31:35.115 --> 02:31:38.498]  There was no funding that was done by Congress.
[02:31:39.379 --> 02:31:45.185]  And so that's an easy way to stop the funding of Obamacare, by stopping the theft.
[02:31:45.205 --> 02:31:46.306]  It would be very important to do that.
[02:31:47.327 --> 02:31:53.291]  Back in the District of Criminals, we see that Huma Abedin's family members have now been indicted by a federal grand jury.
[02:31:53.911 --> 02:31:59.434]  And of course, Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff, and so much more.
[02:32:00.355 --> 02:32:02.956]  Close personal associate, we shall say.
[02:32:03.997 --> 02:32:04.798]  She's back in the news.
[02:32:04.838 --> 02:32:11.522]  They say there's a grand jury has indicted two of her family members for conspiracy.
[02:32:11.942 --> 02:32:12.582]  Conspiracy?
[02:32:12.682 --> 02:32:13.163]  Imagine that.
[02:32:14.113 --> 02:32:20.116]  Every time we talk about an investigation, we're always accused of being conspiracy mongers.
[02:32:20.136 --> 02:32:26.559]  You know, almost everybody that is charged with a crime in America, conspiracy is one of those charges.
[02:32:26.879 --> 02:32:32.242]  Because if you're involved in something the government says is illegal and you talk to one other person about it, that's a conspiracy.
[02:32:33.046 --> 02:32:33.686]  It's a real thing.
[02:32:34.067 --> 02:32:37.209]  So when we look at it, we say, well, you know, is this more than one person involved?
[02:32:37.229 --> 02:32:44.513]  Because, you know, every time there's a shooting, the government always makes sure they tell us it's a lone wolf that's involved in this, so there's no conspiracy.
[02:32:45.294 --> 02:32:48.696]  From the JFK assassination on, it's always a single individual.
[02:32:49.156 --> 02:32:50.017]  So move on.
[02:32:50.137 --> 02:32:51.077]  There's nothing to look at.
[02:32:51.237 --> 02:32:52.838]  And you can trust the official story.
[02:32:52.958 --> 02:32:53.619]  Never question
[02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:58.324]  Never question the official story that we get from this district of criminals.
[02:32:58.384 --> 02:33:01.467]  But we do have two of Huma's family members.
[02:33:01.648 --> 02:33:05.913]  I wonder if they are card-carrying members of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:33:07.474 --> 02:33:08.535]  Many people in her family are.
[02:33:08.576 --> 02:33:12.220]  They've been indicted for conspiracy wire fraud and securities fraud.
[02:33:13.709 --> 02:33:20.675]  These people, as they say, with revelations of other suspicious activity at the State Department regarding Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.
[02:33:21.336 --> 02:33:28.943]  It seems a good time, by all was had at taxpayers' expense, said a criminal investigator, Mary Jean Belson.
[02:33:28.963 --> 02:33:32.547]  She said the State Department was a great piggy bank for these people.
[02:33:33.462 --> 02:33:38.725]  Were these suspects and State Department officials involved in peddling access to Clinton's State Department?
[02:33:38.765 --> 02:33:44.048]  I think the answer to that question is yes, says the criminal investigator.
[02:33:44.708 --> 02:33:52.032]  This will be interesting to see how this goes because, you know, she doesn't have her mentor at the top anymore.
[02:33:52.052 --> 02:33:53.813]  Hillary is very upset about that.
[02:33:53.914 --> 02:33:57.696]  Also, we have been looking at funding for the wall, and as we reported yesterday,
[02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:08.622]  There is funding for border security in this 1600 page document that was put through, just not for our security.
[02:34:08.662 --> 02:34:13.243]  They're funding border security for Libya and so many other countries.
[02:34:13.263 --> 02:34:20.285]  We've got Libya, Pakistan, Jordan, Afghanistan, a long list of Middle Eastern countries that have been appropriated
[02:34:20.965 --> 02:34:24.430]  About the same amount of money that they were talking about doing for the U.S.-Mexican border.
[02:34:25.672 --> 02:34:29.858]  They're getting $1.5 billion, but we're not getting that for the U.S.-Mexican border.
[02:34:29.939 --> 02:34:30.960]  It explicitly says.
[02:34:31.857 --> 02:34:36.879]  For border security and for counter-terrorism activities in those states.
[02:34:37.279 --> 02:34:43.901]  So, when we look at how we're going to get our border funded, it's clear that we're not going to get it from Paul Ryan and the GOP establishment.
[02:34:43.981 --> 02:34:46.522]  They have always been open border.
[02:34:47.943 --> 02:34:51.744]  Paul Ryan has always been an open border guy, from the very beginning of his political career.
[02:34:51.804 --> 02:34:55.145]  So, Ted Cruz is saying, maybe we can get it from El Chapo.
[02:34:56.206 --> 02:34:59.867]  And now, they're saying they can't find a single dollar of El Chapo's.
[02:35:01.367 --> 02:35:02.268]  Just all vanished.
[02:35:02.628 --> 02:35:03.209]  It all vanished.
[02:35:03.489 --> 02:35:06.652]  You know, Ted Cruz is saying, well, El Chapo's got about $14 billion.
[02:35:06.972 --> 02:35:07.973]  He could pay for the wall.
[02:35:08.793 --> 02:35:13.597]  We could get the money from him after we convict him and have him pay for the wall.
[02:35:13.677 --> 02:35:18.581]  And now they say this is a Mexican Attorney General, his name is Cervantes.
[02:35:18.661 --> 02:35:23.625]  I guess he believes this is a quixotic quest to look for the money from El Chapo.
[02:35:23.665 --> 02:35:27.268]  He says his money hasn't been found because he didn't use the financial system.
[02:35:27.308 --> 02:35:28.049]  That's not true!
[02:35:28.749 --> 02:35:36.235]  We had HSBC convicted because they were laundering money for the Sinaloa cartel, which he was head of.
[02:35:36.655 --> 02:35:42.240]  They even gave their own private checkout window to the Sinaloa cartel.
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:48.324]  He had his own private window for laundering money for the Sinaloa drug cartel.
[02:35:48.945 --> 02:35:52.708]  So now they're saying, well, we think that maybe he didn't even have any money.
[02:35:53.601 --> 02:35:54.542]  And we can't find any.
[02:35:55.443 --> 02:35:56.824]  Because he didn't use the banking system.
[02:35:56.904 --> 02:35:57.445]  It's all a lie.
[02:35:57.485 --> 02:36:04.252]  And then they double down and they say, well, if they find any assets, it rightfully belongs to Mexico.
[02:36:04.652 --> 02:36:05.113]  Mexico.
[02:36:05.553 --> 02:36:06.654]  So, we'll see about that.
[02:36:06.674 --> 02:36:09.557]  All right, we've got Gerald Cilenti is going to be joining us.
[02:36:09.577 --> 02:36:10.658]  We're going to take a quick break.
[02:36:10.978 --> 02:36:14.222]  I just want to remind you of some of the products that we have as part of this special.
[02:36:15.353 --> 02:36:16.514]  I don't have the specials in front of me.
[02:36:16.554 --> 02:36:17.295]  I'm going by memory.
[02:36:17.335 --> 02:36:21.218]  I know we've got a 30% discount on Brain Force Plus.
[02:36:21.858 --> 02:36:23.920]  It's one of my favorite supplements that we have here.
[02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:25.461]  I love Brain Force.
[02:36:25.661 --> 02:36:28.924]  I can always tell when I've had it and when I haven't had it.
[02:36:29.004 --> 02:36:34.068]  And like I said many times, we went through a period of time when I would be very
[02:36:34.688 --> 02:36:35.068]  Careful.
[02:36:35.168 --> 02:36:37.650]  My wife would always help me in the morning as I'm getting ready to go to work.
[02:36:37.710 --> 02:36:40.311]  She would set out all of my InfoWars supplements.
[02:36:40.652 --> 02:36:44.334]  On the weekend, it kind of relaxed and I wasn't going to work.
[02:36:44.354 --> 02:36:48.096]  We'd get out of that routine and I would start to feel a bit foggy, a bit sluggish.
[02:36:48.957 --> 02:36:53.439]  So it makes a big difference to have BrainForce and these other supplements.
[02:36:53.479 --> 02:36:55.741]  But I feel it more with BrainForce than with anything else.
[02:36:55.761 --> 02:36:56.561]  30% off.
[02:36:57.002 --> 02:36:59.963]  There's a wide variety of products that we have that are 20% off.
[02:37:00.023 --> 02:37:01.724]  Secret 12 and many others.
[02:37:01.845 --> 02:37:02.105]  Also,
[02:37:03.625 --> 02:37:06.326]  33% off super blue fluoride free toothpaste.
[02:37:06.786 --> 02:37:11.187]  Which doesn't have fluoride, but it has iodine and it has nano silver.
[02:37:11.207 --> 02:37:14.848]  I don't think you're going to find any other toothpaste that has nano silver.
[02:37:14.968 --> 02:37:17.809]  Very effective at combating bacteria.
[02:37:18.349 --> 02:37:19.889]  Bacteria that causes gum disease.
[02:37:20.329 --> 02:37:22.410]  Gum disease that causes heart disease.
[02:37:22.690 --> 02:37:24.711]  Very important to nip that in the bud.
[02:37:25.131 --> 02:37:29.252]  And your mouth, if you try this, we want to get people to try this, so we've discounted it by 33%.
[02:37:30.572 --> 02:37:32.073]  Sold out very quickly the first time around.
[02:37:32.113 --> 02:37:33.614]  We've got it now back in stock.
[02:37:34.114 --> 02:37:42.880]  And we're discounting it for you to try it, because if you try it, your mouth is going to taste so fresh for so long, that's going to become your go-to toothpaste.
[02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:43.960]  I have no doubt about it.
[02:37:44.321 --> 02:37:45.441]  So check out the specials.
[02:37:45.461 --> 02:37:48.463]  We're going to take a quick break, and then Gerald Salenti is going to be joining us.
[02:37:48.503 --> 02:37:49.704]  There's a lot to talk about.
[02:37:50.104 --> 02:37:51.385]  Puerto Rico's going bankrupt.
[02:37:51.685 --> 02:37:53.286]  We had the debate in France last night.
[02:37:53.306 --> 02:37:54.347]  A lot of international news.
[02:37:54.707 --> 02:37:57.108]  We'll see what Gerald Salenti is interested in talking about.
[02:37:57.188 --> 02:37:57.849]  We'll be right back.
[02:38:13.737 --> 02:38:19.045]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:38:19.225 --> 02:38:19.786]  I take this.
[02:38:20.066 --> 02:38:21.087]  My family takes this.
[02:38:21.188 --> 02:38:25.434]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:38:25.474 --> 02:38:29.940]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:34.623]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:38:34.723 --> 02:38:35.764]  I don't feel good.
[02:38:35.844 --> 02:38:39.346]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:38:39.606 --> 02:38:42.248]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:38:42.288 --> 02:38:47.612]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:38:48.092 --> 02:38:50.514]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:38:51.054 --> 02:38:54.476]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:38:54.596 --> 02:38:56.778]  So obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[02:38:56.818 --> 02:38:57.178]  I love it.
[02:38:57.338 --> 02:38:59.939]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:39:00.139 --> 02:39:01.120]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:06.783]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:39:06.803 --> 02:39:08.724]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:39:08.984 --> 02:39:09.744]  It's a win-win.
[02:39:10.224 --> 02:39:11.185]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:39:13.101 --> 02:39:16.944]  I want to tell you about some of the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:39:16.964 --> 02:39:18.845]  We are under constant attack.
[02:39:19.326 --> 02:39:21.527]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[02:39:21.727 --> 02:39:24.589]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[02:39:24.649 --> 02:39:38.960]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:41.261]  They can't get to us that way.
[02:39:41.641 --> 02:39:44.463]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[02:39:44.503 --> 02:39:45.483]  They don't have that power.
[02:39:45.944 --> 02:39:48.485]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[02:39:48.825 --> 02:39:51.227]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:39:51.687 --> 02:39:54.528]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:39:54.548 --> 02:39:56.169]  This is by listener request.
[02:39:56.409 --> 02:40:01.692]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[02:40:02.053 --> 02:40:02.273]  Again,
[02:40:03.013 --> 02:40:08.756]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[02:40:09.156 --> 02:40:13.477]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[02:40:14.058 --> 02:40:17.879]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:22.663]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from Oz?
[02:40:22.683 --> 02:40:41.083]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com, with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack, because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[02:40:41.403 --> 02:40:44.226]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[02:40:44.266 --> 02:40:46.288]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[02:40:46.648 --> 02:40:48.650]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[02:40:49.110 --> 02:41:00.721]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[02:41:00.761 --> 02:41:03.844]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:41:13.496 --> 02:41:16.799]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:41:16.939 --> 02:41:19.201]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:41:19.382 --> 02:41:27.749]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:41:28.010 --> 02:41:33.595]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it after consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[02:41:33.735 --> 02:41:49.427]  Pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:41:49.627 --> 02:41:51.508]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:41:51.848 --> 02:41:59.494]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:41:59.514 --> 02:42:05.979]  This super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:42:06.279 --> 02:42:13.204]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:42:22.335 --> 02:42:23.436]  All right, thank you for joining us.
[02:42:23.536 --> 02:42:29.662]  We continue here with our 30-hour broadcast, and this is our marathon broadcast to raise money.
[02:42:30.102 --> 02:42:34.366]  We really do appreciate your support, and as I pointed out before, we have some great sales.
[02:42:34.647 --> 02:42:43.275]  30% off Brain Force Plus, 33% off Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste, and 20% or more off of a wide variety of products.
[02:42:43.815 --> 02:42:45.397]  Gerald Cilenti is going to be joining us in a little bit.
[02:42:45.417 --> 02:42:48.921]  I want to talk first, before he comes on, about Hillary Clinton.
[02:42:48.961 --> 02:42:51.825]  And of course, she's making the rounds, spreading the blame.
[02:42:51.845 --> 02:42:58.473]  And I thought it was kind of interesting to see Obama's top advisor, David Axelrod, pushing back on this.
[02:42:58.493 --> 02:43:02.758]  There apparently is no love lost by some people in the Democrat Party.
[02:43:03.379 --> 02:43:13.596]  We're pretty upset about her arrogance, pretty upset about the fact that she's still throwing out all this, Russians did it, Comey did it, everybody did it to her, she's not responsible for any of this.
[02:43:13.936 --> 02:43:15.178]  He said it takes a lot of work.
[02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:18.320]  To lose to Donald Trump from his position.
[02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:32.623]  And I have to say, with the Democrats and the low esteem that they hold Donald Trump in, that's got to really be an amazing hurt for Hillary Clinton, the fact that she lost to somebody that she holds in such low esteem.
[02:43:33.003 --> 02:43:35.904]  And of course, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer
[02:43:36.949 --> 02:43:43.074]  Laughed about the fact that Hillary Clinton said, well, if we'd had the election earlier, I would have won before that Comey letter came out.
[02:43:43.094 --> 02:43:44.915]  And he said, well, I'm a Patriots fan.
[02:43:44.935 --> 02:43:51.020]  I think if the Super Bowl had ended in the third quarter, it would have been a different team who won that election.
[02:43:51.500 --> 02:43:52.060]  That's the whole point.
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:53.542]  You know, you can play all these what-if games.
[02:43:53.942 --> 02:43:56.003]  It had absolutely nothing to do with it.
[02:43:56.204 --> 02:44:01.828]  It had everything to do with the fact that she was arrogant, entitled, ran on the fact that she was a woman.
[02:44:02.248 --> 02:44:02.669]  I think?
[02:44:17.933 --> 02:44:22.635]  measurement as to whether or not we are having success in the fight against the globalists.
[02:44:23.175 --> 02:44:24.536]  Will a nationalist win there?
[02:44:25.116 --> 02:44:29.838]  And of course Marine Le Pen said, for Hillary Clinton, are you listening Hillary?
[02:44:30.258 --> 02:44:33.780]  Marine Le Pen said, there's going to be a woman ruling France.
[02:44:34.060 --> 02:44:36.861]  It will either be me or Angela Merkel.
[02:44:37.602 --> 02:44:37.842]  Wow.
[02:44:38.182 --> 02:44:39.022]  That was a great line.
[02:44:39.382 --> 02:44:40.143]  That was a great line.
[02:44:40.283 --> 02:44:42.564]  And then we had Macron, the
[02:44:44.161 --> 02:44:52.528]  Puppet of the globalist, the Rothschild banker, the guy who wants to do everything that Brussels wants him.
[02:44:52.868 --> 02:44:53.509]  He's their puppet.
[02:44:54.210 --> 02:44:56.572]  And he came out with his own deplorable moment.
[02:44:56.632 --> 02:44:59.374]  He called Le Pen voters hateful cowards.
[02:44:59.914 --> 02:45:02.877]  So they had a very interesting debate.
[02:45:02.897 --> 02:45:04.939]  We'll talk about that later in the broadcast.
[02:45:05.259 --> 02:45:09.603]  But I want to go back to Hillary Clinton and I want to talk about some of the comments that she made because we've had a lot of people
[02:45:10.836 --> 02:45:14.881]  Say in the mainstream media that Donald Trump gets his talking points from InfoWars.
[02:45:15.261 --> 02:45:19.806]  I would suggest to you that Hillary Clinton gets her talking points from InfoWars, at least her slogans.
[02:45:19.846 --> 02:45:27.314]  Remember, we've got that clip that we played many, many times where Hillary Clinton says, it's an InfoWar and we're losing it.
[02:45:28.035 --> 02:45:28.475]  And she did!
[02:45:28.495 --> 02:45:30.797]  At least she was honest about that.
[02:45:31.857 --> 02:45:33.458]  She lost that information war.
[02:45:33.779 --> 02:45:35.320]  It wasn't the Russians that did it to her.
[02:45:35.940 --> 02:45:37.461]  It wasn't Comey that did it to her.
[02:45:38.181 --> 02:45:38.822]  She lost it.
[02:45:39.702 --> 02:45:43.365]  And now she's making the rounds and she had this to say.
[02:45:44.121 --> 02:45:47.763]  Let's play this clip about her saying she's pro-resistance.
[02:45:47.783 --> 02:46:09.555]  And I spent decades learning about what it would take to move our country forward, including people who, you know, clearly didn't vote for me, to try to make sure that we dealt with a lot of these hard issues that are right around the corner, like robotics and artificial intelligence, and things that are really going to be upending the economy.
[02:46:09.955 --> 02:46:13.840]  For the vast majority of Americans, to say nothing of the rest of the world.
[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:20.168]  So, you know, I'm now back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance.
[02:46:21.054 --> 02:46:23.195]  Oh, she is now part of the resistance.
[02:46:23.555 --> 02:46:25.016]  See, it's an info war.
[02:46:25.436 --> 02:46:28.097]  She was losing it, but now she is part of the resistance.
[02:46:28.377 --> 02:46:36.341]  You know, she better be careful because she might not just have David Axelrod and angry Democrats coming after her because she blew it.
[02:46:36.361 --> 02:46:38.942]  She might get the Southern Power Law Center coming after her.
[02:46:38.982 --> 02:46:40.703]  She keeps saying she's part of the resistance.
[02:46:41.479 --> 02:46:44.402]  You know, they like to make all kinds of assumptions about us when we say that.
[02:46:44.982 --> 02:46:48.946]  That we're not out there trying to win hearts and minds, but we're trying to get violent with people.
[02:46:48.986 --> 02:46:53.730]  Well, you know, Hillary Clinton, she's part of the resistance, and it's an info war, but she's losing it.
[02:46:53.850 --> 02:46:58.434]  The other thing that Hillary Clinton's been doing, of course, is going around and talking about, guess what?
[02:46:59.155 --> 02:47:00.316]  Women's issues.
[02:47:00.936 --> 02:47:01.157]  Yeah.
[02:47:01.477 --> 02:47:01.997]  Women's issues.
[02:47:02.017 --> 02:47:03.138]  That's all she ever wants to talk about.
[02:47:03.158 --> 02:47:07.923]  So she was going to Planned Parenthood to celebrate their 100th anniversary.
[02:47:08.835 --> 02:47:10.096]  And what does she focus on?
[02:47:10.857 --> 02:47:13.398]  She focuses on the Handmaid's Tale.
[02:47:14.919 --> 02:47:16.100]  How many times are we going to hear this?
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:18.262]  And I've reported about this multiple times.
[02:47:18.282 --> 02:47:21.444]  We've talked about the fact that it's really the Handmaid's Burka.
[02:47:22.104 --> 02:47:30.670]  The idea that the UN would be putting Saudi Arabia in charge of not only human rights, that they would sit on the Human Rights Council of the United Nations,
[02:47:31.471 --> 02:47:37.093]  But that they would also set on the UN's Committee for Women's Rights.
[02:47:37.453 --> 02:47:38.154]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:47:38.694 --> 02:47:41.595]  Does Hollywood not know what's going on in Saudi Arabia?
[02:47:41.615 --> 02:47:42.395]  Of course they know.
[02:47:42.415 --> 02:47:43.876]  Of course Hillary Clinton knows.
[02:47:43.916 --> 02:47:45.856]  Of course she knows what Sharia law is about.
[02:47:45.896 --> 02:47:49.178]  And it was an advocate of Sharia law.
[02:47:49.958 --> 02:47:51.158]  I call him Sharia Khan.
[02:47:51.538 --> 02:47:55.140]  The guy who introduced her at the Democrat National Convention.
[02:47:56.192 --> 02:48:04.816]  He's an advocate of Sharia law that dominates women in a far worse way than Margaret Atwood's little fairy tale for feminists.
[02:48:05.656 --> 02:48:19.802]  And of course there, the victims, she wrote it as Ronald Reagan was president, so it's meant to push back against Ronald Reagan, but there, the oppressors are men who are Christians, not men who are Muslims.
[02:48:21.676 --> 02:48:25.159]  And they turned this whole thing upside down on its head.
[02:48:25.579 --> 02:48:30.703]  Maybe we'll play a little bit of that first, but this is what she had to say about The Handmaid's Tale.
[02:48:30.743 --> 02:48:34.325]  She said, we can never let them grind us down, to paraphrase Margaret Atwood.
[02:48:34.766 --> 02:48:39.890]  We come tonight to celebrate the last 100 years, the progress that so many generations have fought so hard for.
[02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:43.732]  What a time it is to be holding this centennial of Planned Parenthood.
[02:48:44.433 --> 02:48:49.357]  Just ask those who've been watching The Handmaid's Tale, a book that I read and was captivated by years ago.
[02:48:50.077 --> 02:48:57.909]  Now, I am not suggesting this dystopian future is around the corner, but this show has prompted important conversations about women's rights and autonomy.
[02:48:58.410 --> 02:49:00.754]  Yeah, that's what they want you to understand.
[02:49:00.774 --> 02:49:05.000]  They want to tell you that this show, The Handmaid's Tale,
[02:49:06.332 --> 02:49:08.813]  Is about what immediately follows the Trump administration.
[02:49:09.313 --> 02:49:09.673]  And a war.
[02:49:09.693 --> 02:49:12.134]  As a matter of fact, let's go to that, let's play that trailer.
[02:49:12.454 --> 02:49:18.056]  And let people hear the propaganda that is coming from this Hulu production.
[02:49:18.136 --> 02:49:21.097]  Let's play the trailer for The Handmaid's Tale.
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:28.121]  I was asleep before.
[02:49:28.542 --> 02:49:29.522]  That's how we let it happen.
[02:49:30.603 --> 02:49:32.564]  When they slaughtered Congress, we didn't wake up.
[02:49:33.144 --> 02:49:37.086]  When they blamed terrorists and suspended the Constitution, we didn't get in.
[02:49:37.106 --> 02:49:38.087]  Pause it right there a second.
[02:49:38.627 --> 02:49:43.710]  Yeah, when they blamed terrorists and suspended the Constitution, we're gonna have terrorism.
[02:49:44.670 --> 02:49:46.311]  They're bringing in terrorists.
[02:49:46.391 --> 02:49:48.172]  They don't want us to protect our borders.
[02:49:48.192 --> 02:49:53.035]  They want to bring in jihadis so that they can suspend the Constitution.
[02:49:53.055 --> 02:49:54.677]  We know exactly what the plan is here.
[02:49:55.197 --> 02:49:56.398]  They want there to be terrorist events.
[02:49:56.538 --> 02:50:04.243]  Every time you see a terrorist event, whether it's here or whether it's in Europe, they come back and say, yeah, this is somebody that we've been following for quite some time.
[02:50:04.283 --> 02:50:05.303]  We knew about this guy.
[02:50:05.544 --> 02:50:06.244]  He was on our list.
[02:50:06.284 --> 02:50:07.085]  We knew all about him.
[02:50:07.505 --> 02:50:08.486]  We just left him in place.
[02:50:09.326 --> 02:50:12.648]  So they want terrorists so they can suspend the Constitution.
[02:50:13.189 --> 02:50:15.770]  But of course they won't say that they're Muslim terrorists.
[02:50:16.091 --> 02:50:16.831]  No, they won't say that.
[02:50:16.871 --> 02:50:18.472]  They won't say that it's a false flag.
[02:50:18.813 --> 02:50:26.378]  They won't say that it was a false flag in the sense that they brought these people in, knew they were violent individuals and just gave them a free leash.
[02:50:27.058 --> 02:50:28.719]  Okay, that's a form of false flag terrorism.
[02:50:28.759 --> 02:50:32.342]  Actually, you know, we need to come up with a new term that is more detailed.
[02:50:32.842 --> 02:50:37.825]  Because false flag doesn't simply mean that they've got a completely faked event.
[02:50:38.045 --> 02:50:51.292]  You can have real people committing real crimes with real victims but the government lets it happen and uses it for political purposes and that really is a kind of false flag because they want that political result.
[02:50:51.912 --> 02:50:54.733]  It's the kind of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:50:54.933 --> 02:50:56.734]  And that's what we're seeing with these open borders.
[02:50:56.754 --> 02:51:06.819]  But let's continue on with this Handmaid's Tale, this feminist fantasy that blames right-wing Christians for what's going on in reality.
[02:51:06.859 --> 02:51:10.360]  Something's far worse going on as you watch this and look at this.
[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:13.982]  Think about how much worse Saudi Arabia is in reality.
[02:51:14.022 --> 02:51:14.962]  Let's go back to this trailer.
[02:51:14.982 --> 02:51:18.184]  I didn't wake up then either.
[02:51:18.204 --> 02:51:18.524]  Now I'm awake.
[02:51:21.721 --> 02:51:22.542]  My name is Offred.
[02:51:22.982 --> 02:51:24.123]  I had another name.
[02:51:24.523 --> 02:51:26.385]  Ladies, I have to let you go.
[02:51:26.845 --> 02:51:27.646]  It's the law now.
[02:51:28.046 --> 02:51:29.588]  They needed to do it this way.
[02:51:29.908 --> 02:51:31.009]  Women losing their jobs.
[02:51:31.169 --> 02:51:32.390]  Jobs all at the same time.
[02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:34.692]  Can you imagine the airports otherwise?
[02:51:34.872 --> 02:51:35.813]  Run, run, run!
[02:51:35.873 --> 02:51:40.637]  Women being put into costumes, although they don't have to cover their faces like they do in Muslim countries.
[02:51:40.957 --> 02:51:45.121]  But they have women who are fired from their jobs so the men can have their jobs.
[02:51:45.561 --> 02:51:46.802]  Is that really what's happening?
[02:51:47.503 --> 02:51:48.744]  And they're barren wives.
[02:51:49.528 --> 02:51:54.752]  You will bear children for... Oh, and then the biggest thing that Planned Parenthood hates.
[02:51:55.353 --> 02:51:56.134]  Having children.
[02:51:56.554 --> 02:51:59.396]  Let's make this into something that is dark and evil.
[02:51:59.677 --> 02:52:00.477]  Having a family.
[02:52:01.098 --> 02:52:04.561]  And let's spin it in the most bizarre way that we can.
[02:52:04.621 --> 02:52:08.804]  That's the core of Margaret Atwood's story, Handmaid's Tale.
[02:52:08.944 --> 02:52:12.367]  Tonight is a celebration of Gilead and of what we have achieved.
[02:52:12.587 --> 02:52:14.089]  We only wanted to make the world better.
[02:52:14.689 --> 02:52:14.989]  Better?
[02:52:15.450 --> 02:52:16.931]  Better never means better for everyone.
[02:52:18.697 --> 02:52:21.360]  I want to keep on living for her.
[02:52:22.161 --> 02:52:24.164]  Remember your scripture.
[02:52:24.965 --> 02:52:26.506]  Blessed are the meek.
[02:52:28.329 --> 02:52:33.355]  And blessed are those who suffer for the cause of righteousness.
[02:52:38.812 --> 02:52:39.473]  So there we go.
[02:52:39.813 --> 02:52:50.223]  In a recent Atwood interview, Margaret Atwood, the author of Handmaid's Tale, said that after the 2016 election, quote, the cast woke up in the morning and thought, we're no longer making fiction.
[02:52:50.683 --> 02:52:51.964]  We're making a documentary.
[02:52:52.024 --> 02:52:53.666]  No, they're making propaganda, folks.
[02:52:54.366 --> 02:52:55.427]  They're making propaganda.
[02:52:55.828 --> 02:53:02.134]  And understand that when they say, we have to encourage millions of women who support Planned Parenthood to keep fighting, said Hillary Clinton,
[02:53:02.858 --> 02:53:08.722]  You know, they're killing girls as well as boys when they kill these babies.
[02:53:09.083 --> 02:53:11.564]  And let's understand that it is murder.
[02:53:12.105 --> 02:53:17.349]  You know, Margaret Atwood, not Margaret Atwood, but Margaret Sanger, and all these Margarets.
[02:53:17.809 --> 02:53:20.771]  Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood.
[02:53:20.991 --> 02:53:22.993]  And of course, she was a hardcore eugenicist.
[02:53:24.474 --> 02:53:26.975]  And she came after black babies especially.
[02:53:27.556 --> 02:53:29.497]  She thought that they needed to be eliminated.
[02:53:29.597 --> 02:53:34.260]  But even Margaret Sanger said that abortion was murder.
[02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:37.041]  That it kills the life of a baby.
[02:53:37.061 --> 02:53:45.106]  And this is an article that came out yesterday on the New American Planned Parenthood said in 1952, believe it or not, abortion kills life.
[02:53:46.311 --> 02:53:57.534]  Margaret Sanger considered abortion to be an alternative to birth control, not simply another form of birth control, and she wrote, quote, it is an alternative that I cannot too strongly condemn.
[02:53:58.234 --> 02:54:04.395]  She would later declare abortion immoral because, quote, no matter how early it was performed, it was taking life.
[02:54:05.015 --> 02:54:06.016]  She died in 1966.
[02:54:06.816 --> 02:54:11.237]  Four years later, Planned Parenthood performed its first abortion in Syracuse, New York.
[02:54:12.239 --> 02:54:13.500]  So, she dies in 1966.
[02:54:13.660 --> 02:54:22.426]  The founder of Planned Parenthood, even though she was a radical eugenicist, she wanted to stop the birth of black babies.
[02:54:24.608 --> 02:54:26.569]  She said that abortion was murder.
[02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:31.012]  And they did not do any abortions until four years after she died.
[02:54:31.052 --> 02:54:31.633]  So she dies in 66.
[02:54:31.733 --> 02:54:32.673]  In 1970, they do their first abortion.
[02:54:32.813 --> 02:54:33.534]  By 1976, thanks to Roe v. Wade,
[02:54:36.932 --> 02:54:40.135]  They were performing 70,000 abortions a year.
[02:54:40.215 --> 02:54:44.820]  In 2015, according to New American, it performed 320,000 abortions.
[02:54:46.341 --> 02:54:48.343]  35% of all abortions in the United States.
[02:54:48.744 --> 02:54:52.467]  This is what Hillary Clinton is celebrating the 100th anniversary of.
[02:54:52.748 --> 02:54:53.608]  This organization.
[02:54:54.309 --> 02:55:00.072]  And as you look at this propaganda of the Handmaid's Tale, I see these headlines everywhere.
[02:55:00.192 --> 02:55:01.213]  You look at the reviews.
[02:55:01.853 --> 02:55:02.393]  Gizmodo.
[02:55:02.433 --> 02:55:05.475]  The Handmaid's Tale gives more proof that men are monsters.
[02:55:05.715 --> 02:55:06.656]  We all know that, don't we?
[02:55:06.896 --> 02:55:09.237]  We all know that because Hillary Clinton has told us that.
[02:55:09.817 --> 02:55:11.978]  Think about the number of abortions that are happening.
[02:55:12.018 --> 02:55:16.160]  According to the World Health Organization, there's about 40 to 50 million abortions every year.
[02:55:16.621 --> 02:55:20.883]  The taking of a human life, according to the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Singer.
[02:55:21.523 --> 02:55:22.124]  In the U.S.,
[02:55:23.004 --> 02:55:25.767]  There are about 3,000 abortions every day.
[02:55:26.368 --> 02:55:29.211]  That's about the same number of people who died on September 11, 2001.
[02:55:31.053 --> 02:55:37.660]  We reorganized our entire society based on that one event where 3,000 people were killed in that one day.
[02:55:38.962 --> 02:55:39.863]  We have destroyed
[02:55:40.836 --> 02:55:47.258]  What little fragments remained of the Constitution because of September 11th, where 3,000 people were killed.
[02:55:47.759 --> 02:55:51.900]  And yet we have 3,000 babies murdered, according to Margaret Sanger.
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:52.600]  Not according to me.
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:56:00.243]  And of course, when we went to the abortion protest here in Austin, we had people get in my wife's face.
[02:56:00.883 --> 02:56:02.904]  Now we've got it on tape, we've played it many times.
[02:56:02.944 --> 02:56:04.444]  If you're an InfoWars listener, you've seen it.
[02:56:05.025 --> 02:56:08.106]  They got in her face and said, I kill my babies.
[02:56:09.178 --> 02:56:11.860]  They bragged about the number of abortions they had.
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:13.721]  Not just one person, multiple people.
[02:56:14.922 --> 02:56:21.966]  When they were leaving, my daughter who was there with her, who at the time was, let's see, how many years ago was that?
[02:56:21.986 --> 02:56:22.807]  Was that two years ago?
[02:56:22.827 --> 02:56:23.547]  She was 13.
[02:56:24.808 --> 02:56:27.270]  My daughter was in the car with my wife as they were driving away.
[02:56:27.310 --> 02:56:32.313]  These people spat at my daughter, spat on the window that was rolled up.
[02:56:32.913 --> 02:56:36.896]  This is the hate that these people who are a cult of death have.
[02:56:38.035 --> 02:56:41.173]  If they can kill their babies, they can spit on your baby.
[02:56:42.110 --> 02:56:43.211]  They're capable of doing anything.
[02:56:43.331 --> 02:56:46.052]  These are the people that Hillary Clinton celebrates.
[02:56:46.352 --> 02:56:53.817]  So, for all the issues that we have with Donald Trump and the things that we would like to see him get, and I understand that he's got a lot of opposition from Paul Ryan.
[02:56:54.197 --> 02:56:56.678]  He's got to work out who are his friends, who are his enemies.
[02:56:57.238 --> 02:57:08.185]  I hope that he stays on this course of nationalism versus globalism, but for all the problems that we've got, the concerns that we've got as to whether or not we're going to see any change, or are we just going to keep the status quo in Washington,
[02:57:09.065 --> 02:57:16.287]  Understand that if we had had somebody like Hillary Clinton in, think about how much worse it would be than with Donald Trump.
[02:57:16.828 --> 02:57:26.371]  So yeah, I don't regret, even at this point, even with things that I've seen that I disagree with Donald Trump on, I do not regret having voted for him at all.
[02:57:27.111 --> 02:57:33.613]  We look at this woman who even created the Negro Project to reduce the number of black people.
[02:57:33.773 --> 02:57:36.334]  Margaret Singer said abortion is murder.
[02:57:37.094 --> 02:57:40.285]  And I want to give you another example while we're talking about issues of morality.
[02:57:41.803 --> 02:57:42.704]  We have Donald Trump.
[02:57:42.724 --> 02:57:45.545]  This is a news story that broke last evening.
[02:57:45.605 --> 02:57:46.946]  It's up on the Drudge Report.
[02:57:46.966 --> 02:57:51.349]  Trump orders an ease on the ban of political activities by churches.
[02:57:52.289 --> 02:57:57.132]  And this is a very interesting case because we've talked to the organizations that organized protests.
[02:57:57.812 --> 02:58:04.356]  Remember, it was Lyndon Johnson who came after churches because they had opposed him in his re-election.
[02:58:04.396 --> 02:58:09.639]  He had nearly lost his re-election as a congressman, and so he decided he would gag churches
[02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:18.290]  For that, and he got the IRS to put in the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits church leaders from speaking about politics from the pulpit.
[02:58:18.390 --> 02:58:21.434]  Unless, of course, you are a Democrat church.
[02:58:21.474 --> 02:58:22.916]  Then they kind of waive that rule.
[02:58:25.413 --> 02:58:26.334]  And people noticed that.
[02:58:26.414 --> 02:58:28.575]  They said, you know, they're waiving that in some cases.
[02:58:29.035 --> 02:58:31.296]  They're threatening to take away people's tax deduction.
[02:58:31.336 --> 02:58:48.626]  And think about it, when these churches organize as a 501c3 charitable organization, if they come back and say, because you spoke about political issues, we're going to remove your tax-exempt status, and we're going to make things very difficult for all the people who contributed money to you, because they're all going to lose their
[02:58:49.488 --> 02:58:50.709]  Tax deductions that they made.
[02:58:50.749 --> 02:59:02.038]  I mean, that would just trickle throughout and create so much havoc and unrest for everybody that they intimidated pastors since the 1950s.
[02:59:02.058 --> 02:59:03.819]  1954 that he put it in there.
[02:59:03.879 --> 02:59:05.560]  So we've got something that's been going on for 63 years.
[02:59:07.984 --> 02:59:08.825]  The Johnson Amendment.
[02:59:09.345 --> 02:59:11.947]  It is not a law, as The Hill reports it.
[02:59:12.007 --> 02:59:12.747]  It is not a law.
[02:59:12.947 --> 02:59:17.130]  It is a ruling by the bureaucrats.
[02:59:17.730 --> 02:59:20.592]  We don't have Congress writing laws anymore.
[02:59:20.652 --> 02:59:25.816]  We have the IRS and the FCC and all these other organizations writing the laws.
[02:59:26.596 --> 02:59:28.037]  Congress has abdicated its authority.
[02:59:28.057 --> 02:59:31.740]  And so this is another form of tyranny by the IRS.
[02:59:32.501 --> 02:59:37.245]  And it's interesting that they had some churches started.
[02:59:37.285 --> 02:59:38.546]  At first it was just nine of them.
[02:59:39.327 --> 02:59:43.710]  They gave explicit... it was Pulpit Freedom Sunday that was organized.
[02:59:44.311 --> 02:59:46.452]  And they gave explicitly political speeches.
[02:59:46.492 --> 02:59:51.416]  They taped them, audio taped them, and sent them to the IRS and defied them.
[02:59:51.997 --> 02:59:54.059]  Defied them to come after them.
[02:59:54.679 --> 02:59:57.201]  Because they have First Amendment protection.
[02:59:57.521 --> 02:59:58.602]  And that's what we need to do.
[02:59:58.922 --> 03:00:00.063]  That's what is so important about this.
[03:00:00.083 --> 03:00:08.348]  Whether you're a Christian or not, whether you want to see them talking about politics in a church, and I mean, if you don't like politics in the church, go to a different church where the pastor doesn't talk about it.
[03:00:08.968 --> 03:00:12.791]  But you cannot censor people's political speech.
[03:00:13.611 --> 03:00:14.212]  You can't do that.
[03:00:15.169 --> 03:00:19.191]  And it's important that we stand on our rights, that we defy the government.
[03:00:19.531 --> 03:00:23.733]  And I really do appreciate the pastors who stood up for this, who made it an issue.
[03:00:23.753 --> 03:00:26.875]  It started out with just nine churches, and it spread to hundreds of churches.
[03:00:27.535 --> 03:00:33.158]  Donald Trump took this up as he was campaigning, and now he has put out an executive order
[03:00:33.678 --> 03:00:39.321]  Now, I'm glad that President Trump did this, but it highlights how bad the situation is when you have a sitting president who has to beg the bureaucracy
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:02.441]  To not enforce this rule that they made.
[03:01:02.861 --> 03:01:03.722]  Not that Congress made.
[03:01:04.562 --> 03:01:05.822]  It's not that it's a law.
[03:01:06.643 --> 03:01:11.044]  It's not even that could be taken to the Supreme Court and found unconstitutional.
[03:01:11.344 --> 03:01:16.886]  This is an unconstitutional edict from a bureaucracy and the President has to plead with them not to do this.
[03:01:16.966 --> 03:01:17.847]  Will they listen to him?
[03:01:17.907 --> 03:01:19.387]  They didn't listen to the Constitution.
[03:01:20.648 --> 03:01:23.829]  So will they listen to the President and not prosecute these people?
[03:01:24.784 --> 03:01:27.467]  I hope they don't stop the Pulpit Freedom Sunday.
[03:01:27.587 --> 03:01:29.970]  I hope these people get in the face of the IRS.
[03:01:30.471 --> 03:01:31.392]  That's just the beginning.
[03:01:31.652 --> 03:01:38.059]  Once we realize that if we defy them and they back down, and we keep coming after them, then we'll get some of our other freedoms back.
[03:01:38.179 --> 03:01:41.523]  That is the pattern that we have to follow to get our freedoms back.
[03:01:41.844 --> 03:01:45.308]  Whether you care about this particular issue or not, that is the pattern that you have to do.
[03:01:46.539 --> 03:01:50.526]  Organized civil disobedience when the government disobeys the law.
[03:01:50.586 --> 03:01:54.352]  And I'm glad that Donald Trump is saying that he wants the IRS to back down.
[03:01:54.613 --> 03:01:56.175]  But we shouldn't have to say that.
[03:01:56.616 --> 03:01:58.098]  They don't have the authority to do that.
[03:01:59.104 --> 03:02:00.886]  They don't have the authority to make this law.
[03:02:01.466 --> 03:02:03.809]  And Congress doesn't have the authority to make the law.
[03:02:04.209 --> 03:02:08.974]  They don't have the authority to infringe on people's religious freedom or their political speech.
[03:02:09.374 --> 03:02:15.880]  They infringe on both parts of the First Amendment with the Johnson quote-unquote amendment to the IRS code.
[03:02:16.261 --> 03:02:18.222]  That's where we get when we have
[03:02:19.244 --> 03:02:22.891]  Bureaucracies that are writing 80,000 pages of regulations every year.
[03:02:23.412 --> 03:02:25.436]  The Congress could never write that many laws.
[03:02:25.456 --> 03:02:29.063]  That's one of the reasons why we have a Congress, so we don't have that many laws.
[03:02:30.006 --> 03:02:39.572]  We have to get back to the situation where we have a Congress that writes laws and a Congress that shuts down a bureaucracy that thinks that they are a law unto themselves.
[03:02:40.353 --> 03:02:41.113]  Like the IRS.
[03:02:41.274 --> 03:02:42.174]  Like the FCC.
[03:02:42.675 --> 03:02:43.455]  Like the FEC.
[03:02:43.515 --> 03:02:45.957]  Like all these different three-letter alphabet agencies.
[03:02:45.997 --> 03:02:47.638]  They all think they're a law unto themselves.
[03:02:48.118 --> 03:02:49.059]  They write the laws.
[03:02:49.399 --> 03:02:51.500]  They charge you with violations.
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:53.202]  You don't have a presumption of innocence.
[03:02:53.242 --> 03:02:54.602]  They can take your property.
[03:02:54.642 --> 03:02:55.823]  They say it's a civil action.
[03:02:55.843 --> 03:02:57.785]  There's no prohibition against excessive fines.
[03:02:58.065 --> 03:02:58.625]  On and on and on.
[03:02:58.705 --> 03:02:59.626]  This is the fiction.
[03:03:00.206 --> 03:03:00.807]  That we live in.
[03:03:01.607 --> 03:03:04.209]  And it needs to start unraveling, wherever we can unravel it.
[03:03:04.990 --> 03:03:06.431]  Alright, we're gonna take a quick break here.
[03:03:07.492 --> 03:03:11.414]  Just want to remind you that we have a lot of specials as part of this 30-hour broadcast.
[03:03:11.434 --> 03:03:16.297]  It's one of the reasons that we're running this 30-hour broadcast, is to fund this operation.
[03:03:16.357 --> 03:03:17.898]  We really do appreciate your support.

[03:03:39.393 --> 03:03:47.419]  As a matter of fact, whenever I've got to get on a different schedule or I'm traveling and I've got jet lag, I use knockout and it works fantastically.

[03:04:16.212 --> 03:04:16.632]  Stay with us.
[03:04:21.957 --> 03:04:23.943]  You love to fight!

[03:04:24.966 --> 03:04:25.407]  You're getting it!
[03:04:35.526 --> 03:04:40.848]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:04:41.008 --> 03:04:41.588]  I take this.
[03:04:41.848 --> 03:04:42.889]  My family takes this.
[03:04:42.969 --> 03:04:47.210]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:04:47.250 --> 03:04:51.712]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:04:51.872 --> 03:04:56.415]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:04:56.515 --> 03:04:57.556]  I don't feel good.
[03:04:57.636 --> 03:05:01.158]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:05:01.378 --> 03:05:04.040]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:09.404]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:05:09.884 --> 03:05:12.306]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:05:12.846 --> 03:05:16.268]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:05:16.388 --> 03:05:18.570]  So, obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[03:05:18.630 --> 03:05:18.990]  I love it.
[03:05:19.130 --> 03:05:21.734]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:05:21.935 --> 03:05:22.916]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:05:22.956 --> 03:05:28.585]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:05:28.605 --> 03:05:30.528]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:05:30.789 --> 03:05:31.550]  It's a win-win.
[03:05:32.031 --> 03:05:32.832]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:34.933 --> 03:05:42.660]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:42.921 --> 03:05:49.327]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:05:49.547 --> 03:05:53.731]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology.
[03:05:53.851 --> 03:06:03.799]  ...that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor, using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[03:06:03.959 --> 03:06:06.862]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:06:07.102 --> 03:06:12.867]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:06:13.207 --> 03:06:13.667]  It works.
[03:06:13.968 --> 03:06:22.213]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.

[03:07:42.759 --> 03:07:46.520]  Welcome back to our live broadcast of InfoWars, and I'm David Knight.
[03:07:46.560 --> 03:07:48.240]  We're joined now by Gerald Salenti.
[03:07:48.260 --> 03:07:57.923]  Gerald, thank you for joining us, publisher of Trends Research, and I guess looking at financial news, I've got to get your comments on what's going on in Puerto Rico.
[03:07:57.943 --> 03:08:01.223]  We've now got the largest bankruptcy of a local government.
[03:08:01.263 --> 03:08:03.084]  They had a $20 billion bankruptcy.
[03:08:04.025 --> 03:08:06.527]  Uh, in Detroit in 2013.
[03:08:06.887 --> 03:08:14.055]  Now this is $73 billion in Puerto Rico, but of course, nobody wants to talk about our $20 trillion debt that we have for the federal government.
[03:08:14.395 --> 03:08:19.120]  These guys, their biggest problem I guess is that they don't have some bankers who are printing up phony money for them, right?
[03:08:19.915 --> 03:08:20.476]  Well, yeah.
[03:08:20.716 --> 03:08:26.461]  And again, what's really going on in Puerto Rico is going on in most of the states around the nation.
[03:08:26.841 --> 03:08:27.021]  Yes.
[03:08:27.081 --> 03:08:30.044]  Once we have to meet those pension and retirement funds, etc.
[03:08:30.104 --> 03:08:32.686]  So you're going to see just a lot more of this.
[03:08:33.186 --> 03:08:36.569]  But you're also going to see the same deal that's cut all the time.
[03:08:37.290 --> 03:08:41.674]  They'll bail out the white shoe boys over there on Wall Street so they don't get hit so bad.
[03:08:42.094 --> 03:08:46.016]  You know, I'd just like to comment a couple of things, if I may, David.
[03:08:46.417 --> 03:08:47.377]  Sure, whatever you want to go.
[03:08:47.397 --> 03:08:50.959]  Regarding, you know, listening to your broadcast as I was waiting to go on the air.
[03:08:52.128 --> 03:09:03.053]  And that this is a fundraiser, and I'm really happy to be here and be a part of it, because I also buy products from Alex Jones, and I recommend them highly.
[03:09:03.073 --> 03:09:15.640]  And the point being, it's a fundraiser, and you were talking about the latest repeal of the Johnson Act by Trump, and giving churches the right to make political statements.
[03:09:16.873 --> 03:09:18.715]  We're talking about Puerto Rico.
[03:09:19.176 --> 03:09:21.398]  We're talking about also everything's connected.
[03:09:21.418 --> 03:09:23.421]  That's our global nomic process.
[03:09:23.881 --> 03:09:25.082]  All things are connected.
[03:09:25.643 --> 03:09:29.067]  And it comes back down to money and taxes.
[03:09:29.888 --> 03:09:30.849]  I am opposed.
[03:09:32.119 --> 03:09:37.401]  If people want to talk about, and again, you know, the motto of the Trends Journal is, think for yourself.
[03:09:37.801 --> 03:09:45.663]  So we don't push our beliefs on anyone and we try to speak the truth as much as we possibly can with facts.
[03:09:46.544 --> 03:09:49.685]  I'm totally against these non-profits.
[03:09:50.345 --> 03:10:00.529]  I mean, here's InfoWars putting out information that educates people, awakens them, and lets them think for themselves, as does the Trends Journal.
[03:10:01.109 --> 03:10:02.309]  We pay taxes.
[03:10:03.130 --> 03:10:05.190]  You have a fundraiser going on.
[03:10:05.210 --> 03:10:10.232]  You know, if, and I don't mean this to be, you know, believe in anything that you want.
[03:10:10.652 --> 03:10:17.835]  If you believe that Mary was a virgin, Moses came down with Ten Commandments, Buddha was born on a lotus blossom, that's wonderful.
[03:10:18.675 --> 03:10:23.781]  But there are also a couple of hundred other religions out there with their own beliefs.
[03:10:24.442 --> 03:10:30.149]  If people want to talk about a separation of church and state, how about paying taxes?
[03:10:30.569 --> 03:10:32.812]  Why should you be getting a separate break?
[03:10:33.452 --> 03:10:36.356]  Because you're also losing all the public services.
[03:10:39.517 --> 03:10:47.621]  Part of it is that they have set themselves up as corporations, and that puts a whole other level of control that they have accepted.
[03:10:47.661 --> 03:10:52.543]  So I understand the whole argument against not becoming a 501c3 church.
[03:10:53.143 --> 03:11:00.967]  I've been involved with churches that did not go down that path, that did not want to put that bridle in their mouth, and so that's the other part of this.
[03:11:01.387 --> 03:11:07.530]  It's just that what I liked about this, Gerald, is the pattern that somebody is going to stand up and say,
[03:11:08.070 --> 03:11:15.777]  You know, you can try to use the tax code as a weapon to silence people, because they had a long tradition that said, we're not going to tax church property, whatever.
[03:11:15.797 --> 03:11:17.658]  So we can argue whether or not that should be there.
[03:11:18.039 --> 03:11:20.280]  But it kind of evolved into that situation.
[03:11:20.321 --> 03:11:26.446]  But immediately in 1954, Lyndon Johnson said, I'm going to shut down political speech of people who oppose me.
[03:11:26.466 --> 03:11:31.130]  And of course, it was the churches who were actively involved in the American Revolution.
[03:11:31.670 --> 03:11:38.995]  Uh, there was a lot of people who spoke on that, and so he didn't want a certain kind of political speech, and that's where, what this was born from.
[03:11:39.075 --> 03:11:53.865]  It was born from that, and it was born from the control of the bureaucracy that can just do whatever they wish, and Congress just takes a back seat and abdicates its power to these bureaucracies who just rule, to the point that we have to have a president beg them, don't enforce this rule here, so.
[03:11:53.885 --> 03:11:57.747]  Yeah, well, I'm, again, you know, it's bigger than the church issues, the point that I'm making.
[03:11:57.908 --> 03:11:58.168]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:11:58.348 --> 03:12:01.190]  It's all of these, it's all of these non-profits.
[03:12:02.110 --> 03:12:24.098]  It's all of these universities that are paying these presidents and their coaches, you know, millions of dollars, and they get a free ride, while we the people are paying, you know, through our nose, and if we miss a dime on our tax returns, you know, they may break down our door to get it.
[03:12:24.998 --> 03:12:37.501]  So I'm saying, going back to Puerto Rico and putting the whole process into place, it's this rip-off of non-profits that are profiting richly, and they use all the public service.
[03:12:37.821 --> 03:12:39.781]  Hey, they got a problem, they call the police.
[03:12:40.082 --> 03:12:45.883]  Hey, they got a problem, garbage men pick up their stuff, but we're paying for their crap.
[03:12:46.403 --> 03:12:52.347]  So what I'm saying against this whole non-profit issue, it should be all done away with.
[03:12:52.747 --> 03:13:06.056]  So if you're going back to Puerto Rico I was talking about, and again, what it is, it's basically levels of incompetence in another example of a government, whether it's city, state,
[03:13:06.736 --> 03:13:10.219]  Or national, being run by incompetent people.
[03:13:10.539 --> 03:13:20.806]  So this, this Puerto Rico bubble has been building a long time, they kept taking on more and more debt, and you have a bunch of jerks running the show.
[03:13:21.447 --> 03:13:30.253]  Again, as I keep saying, it's the same people you hated in high school and college that wanted to be class president and head of the student council.
[03:13:30.513 --> 03:13:33.376]  Do you think any of these people ever worked a day in their lives?
[03:13:34.156 --> 03:13:36.339]  No, they've been playing politics.
[03:13:36.619 --> 03:13:46.971]  They don't know what they're doing other than taking money that they call campaign contributions, that adults call bribes and payoffs, and they're screwing up the systems.
[03:13:47.833 --> 03:13:55.896]  Yeah, it's interesting that we look at the pictures of Detroit in particular, and people say, is this a bombed out area?
[03:13:55.936 --> 03:13:56.937]  Did they have a war here?
[03:13:57.017 --> 03:14:00.438]  No, they had decades of Democrat socialist policies.
[03:14:00.758 --> 03:14:01.779]  And you can see the result of that.
[03:14:01.819 --> 03:14:07.241]  And so the previous largest bankruptcy that we had with a local government was Detroit.
[03:14:07.581 --> 03:14:08.442]  Twenty billion dollars.
[03:14:08.502 --> 03:14:11.663]  So it's Democrat policies, welfare policies that we see here.
[03:14:11.683 --> 03:14:14.604]  And Gerald, you were talking about non-profits and universities.
[03:14:15.044 --> 03:14:16.005]  I find it interesting
[03:14:16.545 --> 03:14:24.329]  That the objections that were being filed against Donald Trump saying, we're going to have extreme vetting of people who are coming from seven different countries.
[03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:29.112]  These happen to be countries that Obama was dropping bombs on, that he was going to war with.
[03:14:29.152 --> 03:14:33.455]  So presumably, these were dangerous people, we were told, because we had to go to war with them.
[03:14:33.495 --> 03:14:37.357]  And yet, we're going to open up our borders and let these people in and not vet them.
[03:14:37.857 --> 03:14:49.240]  And what they were saying was, their biggest objection to this, they said, was it's going to have a massive impact on our universities, because our universities get money for educating people coming here from other countries.
[03:14:50.021 --> 03:14:53.882]  I said to my wife, I said, how insane can their rationale be?
[03:14:54.202 --> 03:15:04.645]  The fact that we have to give in-state tuition subsidies to people from foreign countries, and we have to leave our borders open for the benefit of the universities that are
[03:15:05.445 --> 03:15:08.267]  Are just getting more and more expensive because of the subsidies.
[03:15:08.327 --> 03:15:11.089]  Every time you subsidize something, it gets less and less efficient.
[03:15:11.129 --> 03:15:13.451]  So that's the vicious cycle that we see.
[03:15:13.711 --> 03:15:22.037]  And they're even arguing that we've got to keep our borders open, even to countries that they say are dangerous enough that we have to... I don't think we have to go to war with these countries.
[03:15:22.557 --> 03:15:31.504]  But if we... if they're saying that we have to go to war with them, then we ought to at least vet the people that we're dropping bombs on and getting angry at before we bring them into our country.
[03:15:31.964 --> 03:15:34.146]  But that's the insanity of this whole thing.
[03:15:34.537 --> 03:15:41.119]  Well, again, you made a good point as well, is that, you know, is people rallying around to reverse it?
[03:15:41.719 --> 03:15:45.120]  And that's the other thing that people keep saying, that, you know, what can I do?
[03:15:45.220 --> 03:15:46.100]  I can't do anything.
[03:15:46.220 --> 03:15:47.440]  I don't have any power.
[03:15:48.140 --> 03:15:50.281]  And again, it's up to the people to change it.
[03:15:50.321 --> 03:15:58.743]  It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate and tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom.
[03:15:59.563 --> 03:16:00.624]  In the minds of men.
[03:16:01.164 --> 03:16:01.444]  That's right.
[03:16:01.464 --> 03:16:07.507]  Oh, by the way, that banging you hear there, they're building a, they're redoing a bank next to us.
[03:16:08.147 --> 03:16:08.788]  Oh, there you go.
[03:16:09.328 --> 03:16:13.350]  They're turning it into a boutique hotel.
[03:16:13.610 --> 03:16:15.811]  But anyway, going back to this... Oh, that's an improvement.
[03:16:16.712 --> 03:16:17.512]  That's an improvement.
[03:16:17.532 --> 03:16:20.654]  They won't be ripping people off in the hotel, hopefully.
[03:16:20.814 --> 03:16:27.497]  Going back to this, though, in talking about the whole tax structure, we should be doing away with these non-profits.
[03:16:27.817 --> 03:16:28.718]  It's a rip-off.
[03:16:29.639 --> 03:16:35.366]  You know, people start these things, look at the executive pay in these non-profits.
[03:16:35.806 --> 03:16:45.318]  Again, InfoWars, the Trends Journal, we're doing work that helps the population, but we don't go for the non-profit rip-off.
[03:16:45.358 --> 03:16:47.380]  You have a fundraiser going on.
[03:16:48.101 --> 03:16:48.682]  That's right.
[03:16:48.742 --> 03:16:59.274]  And we try to sell products to people that are going to not only help fund our operation, but are going to give people the products that they need to live more healthy lives.
[03:16:59.334 --> 03:17:03.179]  It always bothers Alex, it bothers me, all of us who work here.
[03:17:03.199 --> 03:17:04.240]  It bothers us to see
[03:17:04.961 --> 03:17:07.543]  The government dumping fluoride into the water.
[03:17:07.823 --> 03:17:11.585]  Or, you know, the fact that they're careless about the lead that's in the water.
[03:17:11.625 --> 03:17:12.906]  And we don't want to see that happen.
[03:17:12.946 --> 03:17:16.288]  And so, one of the first things that Alex started selling was water filters.
[03:17:16.328 --> 03:17:20.811]  And then they would accuse us of saying, oh, you're profiting off of fear.
[03:17:20.971 --> 03:17:24.474]  And it's like, well, you know, look at what's going on with the lead everywhere.
[03:17:24.494 --> 03:17:26.335]  And it's not just Flint, Michigan.
[03:17:26.835 --> 03:17:36.522]  There are scores or hundreds of municipalities that fail just on lead, and that's not even talking about what they add in terms of fluoride.
[03:17:36.542 --> 03:17:46.808]  So it began with that, and then Alex started looking, well you know there's iodine deficiency because they don't have, they're not putting iodine supplementation into the salt as much as they used to anymore.
[03:17:47.129 --> 03:17:54.634]  So it just gradually moved from that, and so that's the model that we want to use to fund the operation here.
[03:17:54.834 --> 03:17:56.335]  And it's interesting, we're talking about
[03:17:57.575 --> 03:18:11.400]  The banks and how, you know, we may have $20 trillion worth of debt here that the Office of Mismanagement and No Budget wants to take a look at this and doesn't think it's a problem, so we just have a continuing deficit resolution.
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:16.562]  But they can get away with it at the federal level because they just print money.
[03:18:17.222 --> 03:18:22.884]  At the Federal Reserve, and they can't suspend reality in Puerto Rico or in Detroit.
[03:18:22.924 --> 03:18:27.626]  Eventually reality catches up to them and they turn into what we see in Detroit now.
[03:18:28.606 --> 03:18:31.768]  Yes, and it's going to go nationwide is what we're saying.
[03:18:32.088 --> 03:18:34.789]  Whether it's Illinois, it's state after state.
[03:18:34.849 --> 03:18:36.489]  They're running into these problems.
[03:18:37.050 --> 03:18:42.592]  So, you know, I'd also like to comment in listening to you as well about Hillary Clinton.
[03:18:43.578 --> 03:18:46.083]  And her coming out and making some of these statements.
[03:18:46.664 --> 03:18:51.773]  And again, playing the misogynist card, as she has done so clearly, and she made it a point.
[03:18:52.615 --> 03:18:53.557]  I want to read to you...
[03:18:55.100 --> 03:19:10.672]  This is from... Oh, by the way, and talking about how they talk about InfoWars as, you know, conspiracy theorists, how about calling what the Clintons and the Democrats are claiming that the Russians hacked into the DNC?
[03:19:11.133 --> 03:19:14.455]  How about calling that a conspiracy theory?
[03:19:14.756 --> 03:19:21.921]  Because not one, not one shred of evidence has been provided
[03:19:22.862 --> 03:19:25.267]  To make that accusation the truth.
[03:19:26.132 --> 03:19:26.772]  Absolutely true.
[03:19:27.113 --> 03:19:27.893]  Absolutely true.
[03:19:28.013 --> 03:19:29.674]  And they've had, they're basing this.
[03:19:29.774 --> 03:19:35.037]  Even Comey, when questioned, said he hasn't seen any evidence of hacking.
[03:19:35.097 --> 03:19:40.280]  He's going on the word of the contractor that worked for the DNC.
[03:19:40.480 --> 03:19:41.641]  He's taking his word for it.
[03:19:42.161 --> 03:19:42.821]  CrowdStrike.
[03:19:43.161 --> 03:19:46.283]  So he says, yeah, CrowdStrike, who works for the DNC, said that it happened.
[03:19:46.303 --> 03:19:47.624]  So I'm basing it on that.
[03:19:47.664 --> 03:19:49.085]  He didn't do any investigation of that.
[03:19:49.105 --> 03:19:50.345]  He doesn't have any evidence of that.
[03:19:50.365 --> 03:19:51.086]  We know it's not there.
[03:19:51.146 --> 03:19:52.987]  And even if they found something like that,
[03:19:53.607 --> 03:20:02.414]  We now know, because of WikiLeaks, we now know that the government has the tools where they can make it look as if it's coming from any country that they want to.
[03:20:02.434 --> 03:20:09.359]  And of course, we were told by John McAfee, long before that was revealed by WikiLeaks, is that of course they can mask themselves.
[03:20:09.839 --> 03:20:16.484]  They would never, in their right mind, they would never keep their job if they left their fingerprints all over everything every time they broke in.
[03:20:16.564 --> 03:20:18.487]  That's a good question.
[03:20:30.424 --> 03:20:37.051]  Yes, but yet they're quick to point to others when we put out facts that you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:20:37.392 --> 03:20:45.120]  While here we have the fake news media promoting this conspiracy theory as though it's fact.
[03:20:45.441 --> 03:20:50.947]  I want to read you a quote from Hillary from a few days ago when she made these statements.
[03:20:52.483 --> 03:21:04.574]  Every day that goes by, we learn more about the unprecedented interference by a foreign power whose leader is not a member of my fan club.
[03:21:04.594 --> 03:21:16.785]  He certainly interfered in our election, and it is clear he interfered to hurt me and to help my opponent.
[03:21:17.782 --> 03:21:22.124]  Now, not one fact, and of course the audience cheers.
[03:21:22.905 --> 03:21:23.125]  Yeah.
[03:21:23.365 --> 03:21:40.615]  So what we're saying is this is a total conspiracy theory, not one piece of evidence provided, and yet they keep promoting it, and they'll attack others who put out facts that don't go along with their game.
[03:21:41.716 --> 03:21:49.201]  And whenever we are accused, Gerald, whenever we're accused of a conspiracy theory, it's because we don't believe the government's official story.
[03:21:49.541 --> 03:21:54.705]  We say, well, they say this, but look, that doesn't make any sense, or this person didn't have the motive to do this, or whatever.
[03:21:55.025 --> 03:22:00.048]  We go through and we say, you know, we start to deconstruct that, and we say, and we give people reasons for that.
[03:22:00.288 --> 03:22:03.931]  As you pointed out, she gave absolutely no reason for any of that.
[03:22:04.071 --> 03:22:05.432]  No evidence for anything.
[03:22:06.283 --> 03:22:08.386]  Comey hasn't given us any evidence for anything either.
[03:22:08.406 --> 03:22:09.307]  There's no specific evidence.
[03:22:09.847 --> 03:22:11.409]  Everyone should understand that.
[03:22:11.770 --> 03:22:15.654]  There hasn't been one shred of specific evidence.
[03:22:16.415 --> 03:22:17.837]  This is what we believe.
[03:22:18.258 --> 03:22:20.140]  Oh yeah, you believe that, huh?
[03:22:20.380 --> 03:22:25.486]  You also believe that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda.
[03:22:26.067 --> 03:22:26.268]  Yeah.
[03:22:26.288 --> 03:22:33.941]  So I want to go back to, you know, we are the only magazine that had forecast back in May of 2016 that Donald Trump would win.
[03:22:37.443 --> 03:22:43.390]  And we said that it's, quote, the economy's stupid, that old Clinton phrase from back in 1992.
[03:22:43.851 --> 03:22:45.332]  That's right.
[03:22:45.352 --> 03:22:46.554]  She would not focus on that.
[03:22:46.574 --> 03:22:48.716]  She wanted to focus on the fact that she was a woman.
[03:22:49.037 --> 03:22:50.378]  We all knew she was a woman.
[03:22:50.398 --> 03:22:54.003]  That didn't really help our economy or anything else.
[03:22:54.063 --> 03:22:55.304]  You nailed it back in May 2016.
[03:22:56.952 --> 03:23:04.936]  So now they're playing the misogynist card and that anybody, that any male that voted for Trump hates women.
[03:23:05.557 --> 03:23:07.498]  So here's our Trends Journal.
[03:23:07.918 --> 03:23:10.680]  This is from fall of 2016.
[03:23:10.760 --> 03:23:11.660]  This is our recap.
[03:23:17.071 --> 03:23:33.844]  As evidenced by the polling data, the myth that reactionary white working-class men elected Trump continues to be perpetuated by the prostitute media and promoted by the anti-Trump demonstrations that erupted following the election.
[03:23:34.404 --> 03:23:42.730]  In fact, Trump received the same number of white male votes as did Mitt Romney in 2012.
[03:23:46.079 --> 03:23:56.534]  And, despite Hillary Clinton playing, quote, the first woman to be elected president gender card since she launched her campaign in the spring of 2015, you ready for this?
[03:23:59.286 --> 03:24:05.571]  She received 2 million fewer votes from women than Obama did in 2012.
[03:24:06.771 --> 03:24:13.376]  More importantly, just 30% of eligible women cast their ballots for Clinton compared to 47% who did not vote.
[03:24:13.396 --> 03:24:13.476]  Also,
[03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:27.829]  Some 2 million black voters who cast ballots for Obama in 2012 did not cast ballots for Clinton in 2016.
[03:24:28.430 --> 03:24:37.578]  Overall, Clinton received about 10 million fewer votes than candidate Obama did when he first ran in 2008.
[03:24:37.859 --> 03:24:38.119]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:24:41.812 --> 03:24:43.573]  Nobody to blame but herself.
[03:24:43.973 --> 03:24:55.701]  And I think it's interesting when we look at the French election, the fact that they are using the same narrative that Russians are going to hack our election by promoting certain stories and doing certain things.
[03:24:56.661 --> 03:24:59.984]  They are using that card, but they can't use the feminist card.
[03:25:00.004 --> 03:25:06.248]  But they will not talk about the fact that anybody should vote for Marine Le Pen because she's a woman.
[03:25:07.068 --> 03:25:08.810]  I want to push that back to the side.
[03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:11.854]  So it's kind of interesting to see the parallels there.
[03:25:11.874 --> 03:25:15.878]  And of course, Gerald, we had Macron come out and have his deplorables moment.
[03:25:15.918 --> 03:25:17.881]  He called Le Pen voters hateful cowards.
[03:25:17.921 --> 03:25:21.725]  So we see a lot of parallels there, but they will not go.
[03:25:22.546 --> 03:25:32.635]  With the vote for me because I'm a woman, because it doesn't serve their purpose there, but they just hammered that incessantly, and that was the only thing that Hillary had going.
[03:25:32.996 --> 03:25:38.400]  You pointed that out, the fact that she got fewer women's votes, she got the same number of men's votes.
[03:25:39.241 --> 03:25:45.124]  And yet, that magazine that came out, I think it was Newsweek that came out, certainly not Trends Journal.
[03:25:45.164 --> 03:25:46.925]  They thought that Hillary was going to win.
[03:25:47.125 --> 03:25:52.788]  You knew back in May that she wasn't going to win, but they thought that she was going to win, so they had the magazines printed up and delivered.
[03:25:53.268 --> 03:25:57.651]  And if you read that magazine when it came out, it was all about her being a woman.
[03:25:58.331 --> 03:26:03.573]  And it was her time, and it was time for women to be in the presidency, and on and on and on.
[03:26:03.813 --> 03:26:05.774]  Everything there was about her sex.
[03:26:06.454 --> 03:26:08.294]  Nothing at all about what she planned to do.
[03:26:09.355 --> 03:26:10.815]  Well, she's still staying on that.
[03:26:11.215 --> 03:26:11.856]  Yeah.
[03:26:11.916 --> 03:26:12.896]  Can't get off that.
[03:26:13.436 --> 03:26:19.798]  Yeah, she's still saying that that's the main focus of, that's the major issue facing America.
[03:26:20.299 --> 03:26:23.860]  She mentioned in that talk is women's rights.
[03:26:24.460 --> 03:26:24.680]  Yes.
[03:26:25.080 --> 03:26:29.283]  And I think David Axelrod has had, and a lot of Democrats have basically had enough of it.
[03:26:30.164 --> 03:26:31.505]  They've had enough of her losing.
[03:26:31.525 --> 03:26:35.827]  He said, you have to work pretty hard to lose to Donald Trump because they have a very low esteem of Donald Trump.
[03:26:35.867 --> 03:26:44.453]  But I think they also have an even lower esteem, as most of the Democrats who failed to even show up to vote for her had a low esteem of Hillary Clinton.
[03:26:44.513 --> 03:26:46.434]  And I think they're really starting to push back on her.
[03:26:46.454 --> 03:26:50.717]  They're very tired, as we are, of hearing about Russians and about women.
[03:26:52.060 --> 03:26:52.741]  Here's a quote.
[03:26:53.481 --> 03:26:54.202]  Here's a quote.
[03:26:54.662 --> 03:26:59.525]  Women's rights is an unfinished business in the 21st century, Clinton said.
[03:27:00.186 --> 03:27:04.589]  There is no more important, larger issue that has to be addressed.
[03:27:05.963 --> 03:27:07.785]  That's her quote from a couple of days ago.
[03:27:08.185 --> 03:27:08.666]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:27:08.686 --> 03:27:11.088]  That's the only issue we have in this nation.
[03:27:11.428 --> 03:27:19.376]  And by the way, I'm sick and tired of people playing the gender card, the race card, and the creed card.
[03:27:20.097 --> 03:27:20.297]  Yes.
[03:27:20.337 --> 03:27:29.465]  Because we all know lovely Hillary Clinton, if only a woman was in charge, how they asked Secretary of State Clinton.
[03:27:30.126 --> 03:27:35.011]  How did you feel when you found out that Muammar Gaddafi was killed?
[03:27:35.492 --> 03:27:36.012]  Oh, killed?
[03:27:36.253 --> 03:27:38.014]  Yes, sodomized with knives.
[03:27:38.675 --> 03:27:42.259]  We came, we saw, he died.
[03:27:42.279 --> 03:27:43.180]  He, he, he.
[03:27:43.200 --> 03:27:46.063]  Oh yeah, if only a woman was in charge.
[03:27:46.283 --> 03:27:48.465]  How about bringing back Margaret Thatcher?
[03:27:48.726 --> 03:27:51.449]  Where is Indira Gandhi when you need her?
[03:27:52.069 --> 03:27:53.190]  I'm sick of this.
[03:27:53.430 --> 03:27:58.373]  How about Condoleezza Rice, the next Mushroom Cloud?
[03:27:58.633 --> 03:28:01.895]  Yeah, a cloud of crap that started a war.
[03:28:02.236 --> 03:28:04.437]  If only a woman was in charge.
[03:28:04.837 --> 03:28:10.821]  Samantha Power, with your bad attitude, under, oh, and I forgot Susan Rice.
[03:28:11.201 --> 03:28:16.705]  The three witches of Macbeth that started the Libyan war under Obama.
[03:28:17.285 --> 03:28:22.108]  I'm sick of this garbage of gender, race, creed, and color.
[03:28:22.649 --> 03:28:26.672]  It comes in good and bad in all of them, so save it.
[03:28:27.072 --> 03:28:29.453]  I don't want to hear another word about this.
[03:28:30.134 --> 03:28:32.916]  Women's rights is the most important issue.
[03:28:33.436 --> 03:28:38.117]  There are other issues in this country, and one of them is war.
[03:28:38.758 --> 03:28:44.079]  One of them is people can't make a living, and their families are breaking up.
[03:28:44.379 --> 03:28:51.761]  There's hardship everywhere, and this is the only issue, and this is what the Democratic Party's become.
[03:28:52.081 --> 03:28:54.842]  It's become a race, creed, and color party.
[03:28:55.162 --> 03:28:57.663]  It's no longer a party for the workers.
[03:28:59.088 --> 03:29:07.612]  I agree, and you know, I would add to that list of ruthless, war-mongering women, and of course they always say, you need to vote for a woman because we're going to be more compassionate.
[03:29:08.033 --> 03:29:09.674]  Was Madeleine Albright compassionate?
[03:29:09.954 --> 03:29:20.179]  When she was asked about the half-million children who died, not because they started a war yet in Iraq, but because of sanctions, and she didn't deny that the children died, she just said, it was worth it.
[03:29:20.539 --> 03:29:21.420]  It was worth it for her.
[03:29:21.900 --> 03:29:22.780]  Or Janet Reno.
[03:29:23.481 --> 03:29:27.643]  Janet Reno, who said, we gotta go burn the Waco compound down because of the children.
[03:29:28.447 --> 03:29:29.248]  Right?
[03:29:29.468 --> 03:29:32.591]  So let's remember they do it here domestically as well.
[03:29:32.611 --> 03:29:34.733]  They have absolutely no compassion.
[03:29:34.753 --> 03:29:39.036]  So don't tell me that these women in government have more compassion.
[03:29:39.136 --> 03:29:45.041]  Anybody that gets to a high level of government, we have to really, really watch them because it does turn them into monsters.
[03:29:45.081 --> 03:29:53.329]  Whether they're men or women, they very quickly turn into cold, calculating, Machiavellian monsters who don't value anyone's lives.
[03:29:54.198 --> 03:30:10.713]  And again, people could go on YouTube, put in Leslie Stahl, Madeleine Albright, she was the ambassador at the time, when that question that you brought up, 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of 5 were killed because of Bill Clinton's sanctions.
[03:30:11.494 --> 03:30:13.755]  And when she was asked, was the price worth it?
[03:30:14.096 --> 03:30:16.877]  She said, yes, it was.
[03:30:16.977 --> 03:30:18.598]  Quick Madeleine Albright story.
[03:30:19.799 --> 03:30:23.581]  I was like a speaker on the QE2 at the time.
[03:30:24.062 --> 03:30:27.804]  And it was for high level executives, marketing executives from around the world.
[03:30:29.045 --> 03:30:33.347]  Madeleine Albright was the lead off speaker the first night.
[03:30:33.848 --> 03:30:34.808]  I was the next night.
[03:30:35.308 --> 03:30:39.171]  The ship went basically up and down the East Coast for two days.
[03:30:41.038 --> 03:30:43.840]  Madeleine Albright's there, dressed in red.
[03:30:44.200 --> 03:30:45.701]  She looked like the Queen of Tarts.
[03:30:47.042 --> 03:30:51.585]  Anyway, they gave her a 15-minute introduction.
[03:30:52.426 --> 03:30:54.507]  Madeleine Albright, grew up in Czechoslovakia.
[03:30:54.527 --> 03:30:57.869]  She went to this school, that school, got honors in this and honors in that.
[03:30:58.109 --> 03:30:59.910]  The father was this, the mother was that.
[03:31:00.251 --> 03:31:01.712]  She did this, she did that.
[03:31:01.992 --> 03:31:03.713]  This thing went on and on and on.
[03:31:04.153 --> 03:31:07.696]  Anyway, the next day they introduced me on the next keynote.
[03:31:08.820 --> 03:31:15.742]  Gerald Cilenti, the author of Trends 2000, Trend Tracking, Far Better Than Megatrends, Forecast This, Forecast That.
[03:31:15.762 --> 03:31:16.723]  It was a nice introduction.
[03:31:17.503 --> 03:31:18.684]  This is a packed place.
[03:31:18.704 --> 03:31:19.984]  This is the QA2.
[03:31:20.624 --> 03:31:24.726]  And I said, thank you very much for that introduction.
[03:31:24.786 --> 03:31:31.788]  I said, but I feel a bit shortchanged after hearing Madeleine Albright's introduction yesterday.
[03:31:32.428 --> 03:31:35.109]  The crowd broke up into laughter.
[03:31:35.129 --> 03:31:36.470]  And then I said,
[03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:45.245]  I said, what you also failed to mention is that I graduated PS-76 in the Bronx without honors.
[03:31:48.021 --> 03:31:48.681]  But anyway.
[03:31:49.582 --> 03:31:59.046]  Well, you know, I don't think she has any honor if she's going to not even deny that she killed a half a million children, but accept it and say it was worth it.
[03:31:59.446 --> 03:32:08.011]  I don't care how many honors she gets at these educational institutions or they get handed to her in Washington or at the UN.
[03:32:08.631 --> 03:32:09.891]  She has no honor.
[03:32:10.272 --> 03:32:11.032]  She has no honor.
[03:32:11.092 --> 03:32:21.820]  I mean, it's one of the things, we see all these bumper stickers, I used to say to my wife all the time, we'd see bumper stickers, I have a child who is an honor student at such and such a place, and I said, you know what, we homeschool our kids.
[03:32:21.860 --> 03:32:29.566]  And we homeschooled our kids, not because we wanted them to be academic geniuses, but because we wanted them to be honorable people.
[03:32:29.787 --> 03:32:31.308]  And that was our priority.
[03:32:31.448 --> 03:32:38.633]  And when you have somebody like Madeleine Albright, they can read off her accolades for 15 minutes, and she has no honor whatsoever.
[03:32:39.754 --> 03:32:58.516]  And the other thing too I want to mention is that what's going on, oh by the way, Bernie Sanders, all those liberals love, yeah, he was, he also supported those sanctions and supported all of Bill Clinton's, Bill Clinton was bombing Iraq
[03:32:59.517 --> 03:33:03.563]  Three times a week, by the end of his administration.
[03:33:04.044 --> 03:33:05.085]  People forget this.
[03:33:05.766 --> 03:33:09.732]  And Bernie Sanders was all in favor of that, as well as the sanctions.
[03:33:10.614 --> 03:33:13.258]  So when he says, I voted against the Iraq War,
[03:33:14.259 --> 03:33:23.242]  Bernie, you voted to support all the budgets of the military-industrial complex, and you voted for all of that as well.
[03:33:23.863 --> 03:33:29.885]  So anyway, the other point that I'd like to make, and you're bringing this all together with Clinton and what's going on,
[03:33:31.471 --> 03:33:35.875]  Is that how upset the liberals are that Obama's not in anymore?
[03:33:36.495 --> 03:33:42.160]  And it's there's this pretense that everything was perfect over the last eight years.
[03:33:42.841 --> 03:33:55.312]  And when you start bringing this happens to me all the time because I'm just 15 minutes away from Woodstock, New York, the home of the quiche eating, grin, balsamic smile liberals.
[03:33:55.852 --> 03:33:57.473]  So I have a lot of friends up there.
[03:33:58.294 --> 03:34:06.896]  And I start, they start talking about this, and I go on, hey, you know, Obama sent, you know, 33,000 more troops into Afghanistan.
[03:34:07.776 --> 03:34:11.117]  He slaughtered over 4,000 people with drone strikes.
[03:34:12.097 --> 03:34:15.838]  He destroyed Libya in a war based on lies.
[03:34:16.158 --> 03:34:17.339]  They did nothing to us.
[03:34:18.279 --> 03:34:22.280]  Look what he's done in Syria, 500,000 innocent people dead.
[03:34:22.980 --> 03:34:23.620]  And you know what they did?
[03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:24.400]  They cut me off.
[03:34:24.581 --> 03:34:26.261]  You know, I don't want, I don't want to go into that.
[03:34:27.210 --> 03:34:28.010]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:34:28.250 --> 03:34:30.011]  The left doesn't want to talk about war anymore.
[03:34:30.031 --> 03:34:31.152]  You're saying that you miss Obama.
[03:34:31.572 --> 03:34:33.313]  You're saying how much you miss him.
[03:34:33.713 --> 03:34:48.539]  You talk about, I talk about the National, the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, the wrongful use of Haiti's corpus rights, about doing away with the passe comitatus that allows the military now to come into our cities.
[03:34:49.160 --> 03:34:50.340]  They cut me off.
[03:34:50.580 --> 03:34:52.441]  They don't want to hear a fact.
[03:34:54.002 --> 03:34:56.543]  All they want to do is believe in their lie.
[03:34:57.799 --> 03:34:59.200]  And that's what's going on.
[03:34:59.800 --> 03:35:11.149]  But you made a very important point, David Knight, about how the religious organizations banded together and pushed back on the Johnson Act.
[03:35:11.929 --> 03:35:14.992]  And people feel as though they're helpless, and they're not.
[03:35:15.012 --> 03:35:16.633]  They're cowardly.
[03:35:17.393 --> 03:35:17.533]  Yes.
[03:35:17.573 --> 03:35:19.295]  And that's stopping the future.
[03:35:19.861 --> 03:35:20.941]  That's right, that's right.
[03:35:21.262 --> 03:35:33.586]  And you know, if the liberals would give up on some of their partisanship, if they would talk about peace, and I know you were a big part of the, you had an organization, Occupy Peace, still do, besides Trends Journal.
[03:35:34.286 --> 03:35:38.688]  If they would talk about peace, rather than just resettling refugees.
[03:35:38.848 --> 03:35:42.269]  It's like, let's stop the war and stop creating refugees.
[03:35:42.289 --> 03:35:49.452]  You know, Hamdi Ulukaya with Chobani Yogurt says, well, when I give these refugees a job, they're no longer refugees.
[03:35:49.472 --> 03:35:53.494]  Well, if you give them peace, they're no longer refugees either.
[03:35:53.534 --> 03:36:01.397]  But you're not going to talk about that because you're part of the globalist establishment that wants this mass migration of people, that brings in
[03:36:02.117 --> 03:36:12.167]  Subsidized labor for you, people who don't speak English, so you hire translators there so they can stay on the floor and basically if they don't learn English that's the only job they're going to get.
[03:36:12.528 --> 03:36:20.516]  But he gets subsidized labor from these people that he advocates for, that he brings in, if they would just have peace, if they would just stop the war.
[03:36:20.536 --> 03:36:23.519]  But it never occurs to the liberals and of course
[03:36:23.979 --> 03:36:25.460]  The conservatives aren't going to talk about it.
[03:36:25.680 --> 03:36:26.921]  They're neocons for the most part.
[03:36:26.941 --> 03:36:28.522]  So they're not going to talk about ending the wars.
[03:36:28.762 --> 03:36:33.766]  And the liberals don't talk about it because they love having the mass migration come in of all these refugees.
[03:36:34.566 --> 03:36:38.769]  Well, you know, you make a good point because you're, you know, we, of course, we talk about it.
[03:36:39.290 --> 03:36:42.232]  No one wants to talk about what caused the problem.
[03:36:43.129 --> 03:36:48.431]  It couldn't be because you destroyed Libya and Gaddafi had a, you know, that had nothing to do with it.
[03:36:48.931 --> 03:36:53.393]  Couldn't be the longest war in American history going on in Afghanistan.
[03:36:53.413 --> 03:36:54.174]  That couldn't do it.
[03:36:54.594 --> 03:36:58.455]  No, they love getting their places bombed to smithereens like Iraq.
[03:36:59.056 --> 03:36:59.716]  But you're right.
[03:36:59.836 --> 03:37:01.977]  No one talks about the cause.
[03:37:02.477 --> 03:37:09.300]  And the other thing, too, with Trump, his new budget and the Democrats bragging that the wall didn't go up.
[03:37:11.009 --> 03:37:22.318]  And Nancy Pelosi makes the statement that, you know, how dishonorable or disgusting, words to that effect, not exactly those words, that a wall would be.
[03:37:22.338 --> 03:37:26.241]  And OK, Miss Pelosi, I got an idea.
[03:37:26.261 --> 03:37:32.065]  Open, take off the front door of your house and put a sign in.
[03:37:32.886 --> 03:37:34.147]  Welcome in anybody.
[03:37:34.687 --> 03:37:35.488]  We'll feed you.
[03:37:35.528 --> 03:37:36.669]  We'll educate you.
[03:37:37.269 --> 03:37:38.110]  We'll pay for you.
[03:37:38.809 --> 03:37:40.109]  You don't have to do anything.
[03:37:40.610 --> 03:37:43.171]  We're opening our doors for you, Pelosi.
[03:37:43.631 --> 03:37:47.172]  Oh yeah, you can't get within 20 yards of Pelosi.
[03:37:47.512 --> 03:37:49.833]  She probably got security all around her.
[03:37:50.053 --> 03:37:54.915]  But that's different, because it's a neo-feudal society.
[03:37:55.175 --> 03:37:55.695]  That's right.
[03:37:55.895 --> 03:38:00.897]  Different rules for the political nobility and the economic elite.
[03:38:01.564 --> 03:38:01.964]  That's right.
[03:38:02.084 --> 03:38:17.734]  And on the wall, by the way, you know, Anthony Frieda, of course, the brilliant illustrator who does work for you and us, he sent me an email of a friend of his that came out with a border wall that I think we should put up.
[03:38:18.154 --> 03:38:19.856]  It's all solar panels.
[03:38:21.517 --> 03:38:22.978]  It's a brilliant idea.
[03:38:22.998 --> 03:38:24.919]  It'll pay for itself.
[03:38:26.488 --> 03:38:27.329]  Self-funding wall.
[03:38:27.589 --> 03:38:28.730]  That's a great idea.
[03:38:29.250 --> 03:38:30.572]  Hey, let me take a quick break.
[03:38:30.612 --> 03:38:32.894]  I'm not going to go to a full commercial break, guys, here.
[03:38:32.914 --> 03:38:36.016]  I'm just going to tell people some of the specials because I want to get back to Gerald.
[03:38:36.317 --> 03:38:37.738]  We got started a little bit late.
[03:38:37.778 --> 03:38:39.880]  Gerald Salenti, we're talking to with Trends Journal.
[03:38:41.121 --> 03:38:42.382]  Is Trends Journal research?
[03:38:42.422 --> 03:38:43.523]  Is that it, Gerald?
[03:38:43.563 --> 03:38:44.244]  Is that your website?
[03:38:44.964 --> 03:38:48.346]  TrendsJournal.com or TrendsResearch.com.
[03:38:48.826 --> 03:38:49.287]  Okay, great.
[03:38:49.967 --> 03:38:51.788]  We're going to come back to Gerald in just a moment.
[03:38:52.168 --> 03:38:54.570]  We're not going to go to a full commercial break, CJ.
[03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:56.791]  Let's just tell people what some of the specials are here.
[03:38:57.191 --> 03:39:00.754]  We've got, and this is part of our 30-hour broadcast, and we really do appreciate
[03:39:01.574 --> 03:39:05.417]  You coming on, Gerald, with us to help us in this fundraiser that we've got going.
[03:39:07.039 --> 03:39:09.681]  30% off Brain Force Plus, 20% off Secret 12.
[03:39:09.721 --> 03:39:11.803]  That's our vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:39:11.863 --> 03:39:17.027]  If you need a vitamin B12 supplement, and many of us do, you need to research that yourself.
[03:39:17.327 --> 03:39:19.749]  If you need it, you don't have to take a painful injection.
[03:39:19.789 --> 03:39:24.633]  You can just take this nice tasting liquid formula, put it under your tongue,
[03:39:24.653 --> 03:39:25.213]  Yes, it is.
[03:39:47.083 --> 03:39:49.386]  Patterns it's also it's all natural.
[03:39:49.506 --> 03:39:56.413]  So it's a great way if you're having trouble sleeping for any other reason maybe you don't need to Change your schedule, but you're just having trouble sleeping.
[03:39:56.513 --> 03:40:03.520]  It is a great all-natural very effective Knockout is a sleep aid 20% off that 20% off winter sun.
[03:40:04.001 --> 03:40:07.564]  That's our all-natural vitamin d3 supplement 20% off Prostagard
[03:40:09.266 --> 03:40:15.434]  And other things like Bio PCA, Biome Defense 25, that's 20% off.
[03:40:15.674 --> 03:40:16.916]  20% off Living Defense.
[03:40:17.316 --> 03:40:19.519]  We have DNA Force back in stock.
[03:40:19.559 --> 03:40:23.064]  That is a very unique product that InfoWars has.
[03:40:23.144 --> 03:40:26.909]  It's most interesting ingredient is Bio PQQ.
[03:40:28.050 --> 03:40:31.131]  It costs $30,000 per batch to do that.
[03:40:31.291 --> 03:40:38.213]  So when we run out of it, it's a bit, sometimes it's complicated, it's expensive to get that going again.
[03:40:38.253 --> 03:40:43.374]  But we put that in there because there are 175 clinical studies.
[03:40:43.434 --> 03:40:46.615]  It's unprecedented for an ingredient to have that many clinical studies.
[03:40:46.655 --> 03:40:49.975]  Most of these natural supplements, they don't bother to do clinical studies.
[03:40:50.356 --> 03:40:53.716]  But BioPQQ has 175 clinical studies.
[03:40:53.756 --> 03:40:54.777]  You can do your own research.
[03:40:54.797 --> 03:40:55.937]  You can read the reviews there.
[03:40:56.657 --> 03:41:00.440]  It's very effective in terms of protecting your DNA.
[03:41:00.920 --> 03:41:02.942]  The little telomeres, it's like your shoestrings.
[03:41:02.962 --> 03:41:04.122]  It's got a cap on the end of it.
[03:41:04.863 --> 03:41:11.728]  You can predict the longevity of rats and even humans by looking at how long the telomeres are.
[03:41:11.768 --> 03:41:13.269]  That's little caps on the end of our DNA.
[03:41:13.929 --> 03:41:27.535]  As that gets shorter, and it naturally starts to get shorter, eventually when it disappears, your DNA starts to unravel in bad ways, and that causes all kinds of health issues that affect your longevity.
[03:41:28.275 --> 03:41:32.857]  So this supports the health of your telomeres, among other things that are in this.
[03:41:33.317 --> 03:41:38.059]  That is now back in stock, and also we have super blue fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:41:38.719 --> 03:41:40.821]  9.95, that's 33% off retail.
[03:41:41.081 --> 03:41:41.902]  We want you to try that.
[03:41:41.942 --> 03:41:42.723]  It's very effective.
[03:41:43.203 --> 03:41:47.427]  It's probably, I think, the only toothpaste that you're going to find that has nano-silver.
[03:41:47.927 --> 03:41:52.170]  No fluoride, but it has iodine and it has nano-silver in it.
[03:41:52.291 --> 03:41:59.557]  Very effective at fighting bacteria, which fights gum disease, which also fights heart disease that can come from gum disease.
[03:42:00.277 --> 03:42:03.498]  We really do appreciate your support of our operation.
[03:42:03.538 --> 03:42:05.218]  This is our 30-hour fundraiser.
[03:42:05.819 --> 03:42:07.679]  And let's go back to Gerald Slenty.
[03:42:07.699 --> 03:42:10.400]  You can find all those specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:42:10.740 --> 03:42:16.281]  Gerald, we were just talking and you were talking about the wars, the unprecedented length of Afghanistan.
[03:42:16.381 --> 03:42:21.983]  I wonder if we had had a debate and we had said to the American people,
[03:42:22.998 --> 03:42:24.119]  We're going to go to Afghanistan.
[03:42:24.159 --> 03:42:24.800]  Here's the purpose.
[03:42:24.820 --> 03:42:28.663]  Here's how we define victory rather than having George W. Bush say, mission accomplished.
[03:42:28.823 --> 03:42:32.167]  It was never made clear to anybody what the end point was on that.
[03:42:32.307 --> 03:42:33.748]  I don't think there is an end point on it.
[03:42:33.768 --> 03:42:37.492]  We've had now generals say, I think we're going to be there 20, 30, 40, 50 years.
[03:42:37.512 --> 03:42:39.533]  I don't think they're ever going to leave Afghanistan.
[03:42:39.553 --> 03:42:39.754]  Do you?
[03:42:40.879 --> 03:42:43.561]  No, well, unless we the people decide.
[03:42:43.641 --> 03:42:44.882]  And there's another point to this.
[03:42:44.942 --> 03:42:56.870]  Like you said, George W. Bush said, by the way, we broke apart his... Before I go any further, you're talking about the products that InfoWars has available.
[03:42:57.310 --> 03:42:59.692]  And as I said, I put my money where my mouth is.
[03:43:00.192 --> 03:43:01.753]  I use InfoWars products.
[03:43:02.393 --> 03:43:06.056]  And what I'm saying to people is you put your money where your mouth is.
[03:43:06.636 --> 03:43:28.960]  Because if you don't support people like Infowars and other people putting out the facts, as opposed to those conspiracy theorists, such as the Clintons and the mainstream media, as they talk about Russia hacking into the DNC and other issues which they have no evidence of, it's really important to support this.
[03:43:29.380 --> 03:43:32.961]  Because if you don't, you're going to hear less and less voices.
[03:43:33.481 --> 03:43:35.201]  And again, David, you made the point
[03:43:35.581 --> 03:43:40.023]  Now, when people unite around an issue, they could change the course.
[03:43:40.644 --> 03:43:40.764]  Yes.
[03:43:40.844 --> 03:43:48.768]  So, going back to the war, and we, of course, launched OccupyPeace.us, because it's only about us.
[03:43:49.668 --> 03:43:52.790]  And you're talking about Afghanistan and George Bush.
[03:43:53.170 --> 03:43:58.013]  We broke apart his speech nine days after 9-11 that he gave to the people.
[03:43:59.161 --> 03:44:01.002]  That got us into Afghanistan.
[03:44:01.382 --> 03:44:10.067]  And we said only a madman would speak these words and only people dumbstruck with fear would believe them and believe they did.
[03:44:10.827 --> 03:44:11.047]  Yes.
[03:44:11.087 --> 03:44:13.128]  What happened to the Constitution?
[03:44:14.449 --> 03:44:19.472]  Congress should be only voting to go to war.
[03:44:20.532 --> 03:44:21.793]  And that's long gone.
[03:44:23.729 --> 03:44:24.129]  That's right.
[03:44:24.370 --> 03:44:24.710]  That's right.
[03:44:24.970 --> 03:44:31.536]  Yeah, they always come back and they say, oh, we don't want Congress debating this because we don't want them to know what our plans are.
[03:44:31.556 --> 03:44:39.302]  There's a big difference between a strategy, which is to say, these are our objectives, this is how we define victory, and so forth and so on.
[03:44:39.322 --> 03:44:40.383]  Do you want to do this or not?
[03:44:40.423 --> 03:44:41.244]  And we have a vote on it.
[03:44:41.264 --> 03:44:42.425]  That's what the Constitution's for.
[03:44:42.745 --> 03:44:47.609]  That's what the people are supposed to be involved with, as well as our representatives.
[03:44:47.629 --> 03:44:49.071]  There's a big difference between that
[03:44:49.631 --> 03:44:54.534]  And a tactic which does need to be kept secret, like where are we going to invade Europe?
[03:44:54.594 --> 03:44:56.556]  Is it going to be Normandy or is it going to be Calais?
[03:44:56.616 --> 03:44:57.516]  When are we going to do it?
[03:44:57.536 --> 03:44:58.317]  And so forth and so on.
[03:44:58.717 --> 03:45:03.180]  Once you decide you're going to do a war, you leave it to the president and to the generals to conduct the war.
[03:45:03.620 --> 03:45:06.662]  But not to decide whether they're going to go to war.
[03:45:07.143 --> 03:45:10.065]  Not to decide whether they're ever going to end the war.
[03:45:10.145 --> 03:45:11.806]  That's the position that we're in now.
[03:45:11.866 --> 03:45:12.907]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:45:13.547 --> 03:45:17.031]  It is insane and it's anti-constitutional.
[03:45:17.251 --> 03:45:17.531]  Yes.
[03:45:18.092 --> 03:45:21.935]  Congress has not voted to go to war since World War II.
[03:45:23.223 --> 03:45:23.403]  Yeah.
[03:45:23.623 --> 03:45:24.864]  And that was the last one we won.
[03:45:25.465 --> 03:45:26.946]  And that's the last one we won.
[03:45:26.986 --> 03:45:27.366]  You're right.
[03:45:27.386 --> 03:45:27.707]  That's right.
[03:45:27.847 --> 03:45:41.938]  And now what OccupyPeace.us says also is to close all the bases overseas, use the troops to secure our border, by the way, which we also recommended in Trends 2000.
[03:45:41.998 --> 03:45:44.520]  My book was an international bestseller back in 1996.
[03:45:44.640 --> 03:45:45.000]  And thirdly,
[03:45:48.735 --> 03:46:00.708]  Besides forcing Congress to vote to go to war, have a referendum on each state ballot where we the people will tell our congressmen and women how to vote.
[03:46:01.208 --> 03:46:05.994]  Because we're the ones that pay for the war with our money and our lives.
[03:46:06.514 --> 03:46:07.934]  Yes, yes, yes.
[03:46:08.455 --> 03:46:10.375]  Rich man's war, poor man's fight.
[03:46:10.635 --> 03:46:15.757]  You know, there was a story by CNS News that I covered yesterday afternoon as part of this broadcast.
[03:46:16.157 --> 03:46:19.918]  And they said, you know, everybody's saying there's no money for the border, but there is money for the border.
[03:46:20.378 --> 03:46:22.479]  Just not the American-Mexico border.
[03:46:22.779 --> 03:46:25.680]  We have money in this 1,600-page bill.
[03:46:26.040 --> 03:46:29.361]  We have $1.5 billion for the border of Jordan.
[03:46:29.421 --> 03:46:29.741]  Why?
[03:46:29.821 --> 03:46:33.982]  Because they need to control terrorism, and they need to control their border.
[03:46:34.082 --> 03:46:38.703]  For Egypt, for Afghanistan, for Pakistan, for Libya, on and on and on.
[03:46:38.903 --> 03:46:46.105]  All these countries are getting $1 to $1.5 billion, which was all anybody was asking for for the border between the U.S.
[03:46:46.165 --> 03:46:46.746]  and Mexico.
[03:46:47.226 --> 03:46:47.926]  And we didn't get it.
[03:46:48.226 --> 03:46:51.087]  But for all these other countries, the money is there.
[03:46:52.188 --> 03:47:00.055]  Between one and one and a half billion dollars for all these countries to control their border because they need to control terrorism and so forth.
[03:47:00.095 --> 03:47:02.116]  And that's what we get with our military budget.
[03:47:02.297 --> 03:47:04.699]  They protect everyone else but us.
[03:47:05.139 --> 03:47:05.880]  They don't protect us.
[03:47:06.840 --> 03:47:11.585]  And that's why OccupyPeace.us, it's only about us, and we could change it.
[03:47:11.945 --> 03:47:15.549]  You know, you asked me earlier about some economic trends that we see.
[03:47:16.350 --> 03:47:22.136]  One of the ones, and you well know, you know, we had been negative on the economy until Trump got elected.
[03:47:22.296 --> 03:47:25.400]  Five days later, we did a 180 an hour forecast.
[03:47:25.760 --> 03:47:27.621]  We said this market rally is real.
[03:47:27.981 --> 03:47:29.562]  It's going in a different direction.
[03:47:29.802 --> 03:47:37.005]  There are a lot of positives toward the economy, whether you agree or disagree with him, that are going to change where we're going.
[03:47:37.726 --> 03:47:41.407]  But we're also saying this isn't going to be a fast or big recovery.
[03:47:41.967 --> 03:47:43.428]  And again, we look global.
[03:47:44.028 --> 03:47:51.392]  There's an indicator out there that people should consider, if they're interested in economics, to start watching very closely.
[03:47:51.892 --> 03:47:53.293]  And that's copper prices.
[03:47:54.173 --> 03:48:01.785]  Copper is the barometer of the global economy, and it just had its worst drop in 19 months.
[03:48:04.571 --> 03:48:06.953]  Because it goes back to China.
[03:48:08.034 --> 03:48:11.936]  China uses over 40% of the world's copper.
[03:48:12.777 --> 03:48:14.738]  And by the way, China's buying up the world.
[03:48:15.439 --> 03:48:17.640]  And people are missing on this one too.
[03:48:18.161 --> 03:48:24.785]  And again, when you talk about Trump and new deals, this is really needed to be done with China.
[03:48:26.387 --> 03:48:38.154]  Tencent, one of their companies now, is now the world's very much involved in technology, is now one of the 10th largest companies in the world, according to market value.
[03:48:38.654 --> 03:48:45.518]  So, as we're looking, again, going back to copper and China, China has a huge bubble.
[03:48:45.858 --> 03:48:47.739]  They're trying to slow it down.
[03:48:48.240 --> 03:48:50.661]  So that's why copper prices are going down.
[03:48:51.081 --> 03:48:53.403]  And what they do is they call copper Dr. Copper.
[03:48:55.464 --> 03:48:57.709]  Because copper is like a PhD.
[03:48:58.410 --> 03:49:04.222]  It shows you what is being used in transportation, in electronics, in home.
[03:49:06.616 --> 03:49:08.237]  Copper is used for autos.
[03:49:08.997 --> 03:49:11.057]  And look at the auto sales, by the way, in the U.S.
[03:49:11.077 --> 03:49:12.337]  They're not doing so well.
[03:49:12.838 --> 03:49:15.938]  So copper is a very key indicator.
[03:49:16.438 --> 03:49:18.159]  Again, it's the Ph.D.
[03:49:18.239 --> 03:49:19.739]  model of the economy.
[03:49:20.219 --> 03:49:26.241]  So when copper prices go down, there's an alert bell that goes off in our mind.
[03:49:26.841 --> 03:49:28.361]  So as we're looking at the U.S.
[03:49:28.401 --> 03:49:31.322]  economy, we're looking at steady growth.
[03:49:32.182 --> 03:49:36.866]  And very important tying back into and again, we don't give investment advice.
[03:49:37.687 --> 03:49:41.411]  We had been saying this is not a good climate for gold.
[03:49:42.652 --> 03:49:46.215]  And the reason being Trump going back to China.
[03:49:47.556 --> 03:49:50.719]  If you want to open up a company in China, you can't do it.
[03:49:50.739 --> 03:49:54.262]  You have to become a partner with somebody and you can't be a full owner.
[03:49:55.228 --> 03:49:58.256]  Again, what China did is like what Japan did.
[03:49:58.637 --> 03:50:03.991]  When I was a kid, when you got a toy that was made in Japan, you'd throw it away because it was a piece of junk.
[03:50:04.665 --> 03:50:09.908]  But what they did is they got all our technology and that's what China started as.
[03:50:10.469 --> 03:50:29.020]  Producing low quality product and now they're going to be building automobiles and airplanes to now compete with the United States because the deal is when you manufacture over there because you can't import, your import prices are too high, you have to turn over all the technology.
[03:50:30.057 --> 03:50:32.839]  So you can't become a full owner of the company.
[03:50:33.099 --> 03:50:39.643]  You can become a 49% owner, but you have to turn over all the technology.
[03:50:40.144 --> 03:50:43.526]  And of course, that's always been a part of the China price, which you're talking about.
[03:50:43.586 --> 03:50:44.967]  It's not just the currency manipulation.
[03:50:45.007 --> 03:50:46.008]  That's an important part of it.
[03:50:46.448 --> 03:50:53.772]  But it's also, as you pointed out, stealing copyright stuff, demanding that you participate in that market, that hyper-protectionism.
[03:50:54.073 --> 03:50:55.053]  We're out of time, Gerald.
[03:50:55.073 --> 03:50:55.934]  We've got to stop it.
[03:50:55.954 --> 03:51:08.601]  But people just heard a sample of what you can find at Trends Journal, focusing on key trends and getting that kind of analysis to see where the major trends are happening in our economy, like Gerald was just talking about with copper.
[03:51:08.922 --> 03:51:11.083]  Thank you so much for joining us, Gerald Salenti.
[03:51:11.383 --> 03:51:13.905]  And you can find him at TrendsJournal.com.
[03:51:13.945 --> 03:51:14.345]  Is that correct?
[03:51:14.977 --> 03:51:15.437]  That's right.
[03:51:15.497 --> 03:51:19.359]  Thank you very much, David, and thank you and Alex and the whole crew for all that you do.
[03:51:20.059 --> 03:51:21.639]  Thank you so much for your support, Gerald.
[03:51:21.759 --> 03:51:22.520]  Really appreciate it.
[03:51:22.560 --> 03:51:22.840]  Thank you.
[03:51:23.420 --> 03:51:28.662]  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back with Alex Jones, beginning the broadcast at 11 o'clock.
