[00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:24.938]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:31.260]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:45.446]  You have found it, ladies and gentlemen, the most demonized, most attacked, most lied about broadcast in the world.
[00:00:46.607 --> 00:00:48.908]  Trump is attacked even more than I am, but
[00:00:50.225 --> 00:01:06.859]  I'm only second to Trump, and I am very, very proud to have the radical Islamicists, the pedophiles, the scum of the earth that seek to bully humanity, and seek to end our free societies, and seek to end our free will.
[00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:16.607]  I am so honored to have the trash of the earth, the hypocritical frauds, the social engineers, hired.
[00:01:17.528 --> 00:01:18.769]  It is the badge of honor.
[00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:22.127]  It is the blood of victory.
[00:01:22.887 --> 00:01:24.248]  It is everything I have sought.
[00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.491]  Look at the headlines on Infowars.com.
[00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:29.612]  Professor!
[00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:33.295]  Harvey is karma for Texas voting Trump.
[00:01:37.678 --> 00:01:38.018]  You see?
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.480]  Everything.
[00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:43.843]  Clouds in the skies.
[00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:45.044]  The name Lynch.
[00:01:45.664 --> 00:01:46.545]  The name Lee.
[00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:58.633]  Subway in New York had beams crossing and people thought it looked like a rebel flag, so it's been bricked over.
[00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:01.814]  Every mental illness is catered to.
[00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:08.456]  They're teaching people their new power to run around and race bait.
[00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:17.038]  And the ACLU apologizes for tweeting out an image of a white baby.
[00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.312]  Because that's offensive.
[00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.953]  Because whites are inherently evil.
[00:02:21.414 --> 00:02:27.659]  And Michael Moore has come out and said, America will be better country when whites are a minority.
[00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.022]  And then, of course, they'll have to be exterminated like Zimbabwe and everywhere else.
[00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:37.227]  But Michael Moore, I guess he thinks he'll be long gone.
[00:02:37.887 --> 00:02:45.874]  Meanwhile, you see people of every color of the same race, humanity, red blood, in Houston coming together.
[00:02:46.952 --> 00:03:01.175]  As things deteriorate very quickly and as the water continues to rise, 50 plus inches just the last few days, even more before that, and we've got our reporters all there in the field today.
[00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:03.836]  We've sent even more crew down to the coast.
[00:03:03.856 --> 00:03:11.758]  We've got Gary Haven in his private helicopter, great pilot, flew our crew into Haiti a day after the hurricane there last year.
[00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:14.789]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:27.165]  So he's going to be in Houston today with Michael Zimmerman and of course, Quentin Carter and more of our crew that is down there actually involved in the rescue operation.
[00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:29.868]  Got together with some of the veterans we know here in town.
[00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:41.180]  And some of the off-duty feds that we know and they've got some big army trucks and they're down there right now hauling people out as we speak as well.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.005]  So a lot going on, a lot unfolding, a lot happening here.
[00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:52.151]  North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan, this time the closest they've ever done it.
[00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:55.195]  Serious act of provocation.
[00:03:55.915 --> 00:04:07.686]  I've got a big stack of news for mainline analysts say the chances of war being imminent are now at 35% They were only about 10% just a few weeks ago.
[00:04:07.806 --> 00:04:14.912]  So this is continuing to escalate Continually and it's a very very serious situation.
[00:04:15.513 --> 00:04:16.634]  So that's all I
[00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:23.760]  Coming up today, we have Sheriff Joe Arpaio joining us.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.961]  He said he'd come on after he got pardoned.
[00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:30.464]  They're demonizing him now as a vicious racist.
[00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:34.103]  It's not that it calls me a racist or KKK or Hitler.
[00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:36.606]  Now you've just got to add things like unalloyed.
[00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:37.747]  That makes it fancier.
[00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:40.850]  Or viciously racist.
[00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.674]  You've got all the little cowardly neocon Republicans going, oh yeah, Trump made a big mistake.
[00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:47.796]  Yeah, because he didn't pardon cocaine dealers or murderers.
[00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:51.460]  He pardoned somebody where the border was collapsing into Phoenix.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.216]  Total lawlessness in Mexico, and so he would follow the law and arrest illegals when they were drunk driving and stuff, so he is the ultimate racist when Mexico puts you in a forced labor camp for six months to a year for being there illegally?
[00:05:09.212 --> 00:05:15.817]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[00:05:16.037 --> 00:05:18.439]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.901]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[00:05:22.062 --> 00:05:24.203]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[00:05:24.243 --> 00:05:28.907]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:31.849]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.172]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[00:05:39.054 --> 00:05:39.895]  Unprecedented.
[00:05:39.975 --> 00:05:41.037]  And it's cold-pressed.
[00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:43.099]  That's why Supermail is so different.
[00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:49.426]  People say, well, I know these compounds work, because it's admitted in science, and these are other, what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[00:05:49.487 --> 00:05:51.489]  It's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:52.730]  Why, these aren't anything new.
[00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.815]  Because, why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[00:05:57.015 --> 00:05:57.536]  Dude.
[00:05:57.556 --> 00:05:58.397]  Dude.

[00:07:34.113 --> 00:07:42.718]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:19.222]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:34.366]  We're going to have to move very, very quickly today because there is so much over-the-top, incredibly important news to cover.
[00:08:37.869 --> 00:08:39.030]  But you talk about sick.
[00:08:40.532 --> 00:08:41.493]  Got a professor here.
[00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:43.294]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:08:44.596 --> 00:08:46.677]  An article by Steve Watson.
[00:08:46.738 --> 00:08:47.358]  Professor!
[00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:52.283]  Harvey is karma for Texas voting Trump.
[00:08:54.110 --> 00:09:06.495]  And starting last Friday, I saw the celebrations on Twitter saying, destroy the state, kill all the rednecks, God, please, send a flood to destroy Texas.
[00:09:08.276 --> 00:09:22.482]  And then the ignorant people that have that attitude, they don't even geographically or culturally understand that even if they wanted to kill everyone that voted Trump, that only maybe, what, 40% of the state
[00:09:25.011 --> 00:09:25.291]  You think?
[00:09:46.513 --> 00:09:50.414]  Who is a libertarian, a Christian, a conservative, is a Nazi.
[00:09:51.034 --> 00:09:53.134]  Everyone who isn't is Captain America.
[00:09:53.674 --> 00:10:04.657]  And then I was watching more of the footage this morning of them knocking people down Sunday at a prayer vigil for free speech in San Francisco.
[00:10:06.077 --> 00:10:13.458]  People going out to exercise it in the heart of the beast of the intolerant, hateful, lost left.
[00:10:14.499 --> 00:10:15.999]  And it is just
[00:10:17.182 --> 00:10:20.063]  Overweight, nice church types, many of them.
[00:10:20.843 --> 00:10:31.466]  Totally wimpy, not even knowing what's happening as they're beaten in a gauntlet and then cornered, pepper sprayed, and then spit on.
[00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:41.409]  I mean, there's so many of these videos and they would single people out that were bald or had short haircuts because that's all you need to know, hell, to kill somebody.
[00:10:42.432 --> 00:10:43.332]  Because you're so tolerant.
[00:10:44.132 --> 00:10:50.254]  And then they interviewed some of the women, because it's all these wimpy women surrounding men, beating them up.
[00:10:51.354 --> 00:10:54.875]  And they're saying, Nazis scare me, so I'm going to hurt Nazis.
[00:10:55.496 --> 00:11:11.760]  And it's the most mentally ill, bizarre, cowardly spectacle of a bunch of bird brains hopping around, beating people up.
[00:11:14.144 --> 00:11:20.465]  I mean, we're rolling some footage right here that just shows people trying to grab the American flag away and people exercising their free speech, but this is nothing.
[00:11:20.725 --> 00:11:27.866]  I've got footage of them beating people up, knocking them down, spitting in people's faces, chasing people down.
[00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:33.107]  It just goes on and on and on, dumping urine on them.
[00:11:33.868 --> 00:11:40.729]  They also had thousands of people come with their dogs to have them defecate everywhere so they could all march in feces.
[00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:42.029]  That's official.
[00:11:43.234 --> 00:11:49.176]  There's footage of a guy that just showed up to the prayer meeting and they're beating him up.
[00:11:49.196 --> 00:11:53.798]  And there's footage again of like 20 people around somebody just hawking spit all over him.
[00:11:55.099 --> 00:11:58.100]  And it goes on and on and then Pelosi comes out.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.021]  Normally she can't even hardly form a sentence and she was able to.
[00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:04.342]  She said, well they are white supremacists.
[00:12:06.743 --> 00:12:10.385]  This is the total bullying
[00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:13.570]  And they know what they're doing.
[00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:16.634]  So it's a major coming of age.
[00:12:17.895 --> 00:12:27.908]  And I notice it's like women beating up and piling on men who are the kind of mainline sheep-like Christians
[00:12:29.093 --> 00:12:31.714]  I'm not knocking them at their sheep like, that's their choice to do that.
[00:12:31.754 --> 00:12:34.936]  I'll let a guy throw coffee on me and attack me to illustrate that they're the violent ones.
[00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:46.962]  But beating them in the head with clubs, poles, women ganging up, and then all these real skinny, in-black meth-head types strutting around like they're NFL linebackers.
[00:12:47.062 --> 00:12:49.584]  I mean, they're feeding their oats.
[00:12:50.264 --> 00:12:55.647]  It is a disgusting spectacle of true authoritarianism.
[00:12:56.932 --> 00:13:02.997]  Of really dangerous, dangerous, brown shirt culture.
[00:13:04.678 --> 00:13:13.485]  I've got stacks of news where conservatives, mainline Christians, you name it, are being kicked off Amazon, kicked out of commerce, kicked off by credit card companies, persecuted.
[00:13:14.265 --> 00:13:19.909]  And people are celebrating that Stormfront has been taken offline, outside of a court ruling.
[00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.150]  I don't agree with Stormfront.
[00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.872]  They've attacked me mercilessly, made up stuff, whatever.
[00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:27.208]  You know, if I want to sue them, I'd have to sue them.
[00:13:27.588 --> 00:13:29.148]  The point is they have a right to free speech.
[00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:39.931]  And now Rebel Media, that's owned by a Jewish fellow, it's been shut down, Founder says, was given 24 hours notice.
[00:13:40.692 --> 00:13:42.672]  So the Rebel's been taken down.
[00:13:45.413 --> 00:13:47.814]  And then Stormfront's been taken down.
[00:13:48.154 --> 00:13:54.396]  So mainline conservative sites like the Rebel that
[00:13:56.516 --> 00:13:59.138]  Came out of a conservative network that was in Canada, just gone!
[00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:13.508]  And this is how it's working, just suddenly you're gone, because your, quote, internet service where you've got your DNS filed for your website just decides you're not allowed to be there, and they deep six you.
[00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:25.957]  This is massive sustained censorship, all being announced across the board, demonetization of YouTube, now putting videos into a phantom zone, where you can see them because you uploaded them, but other people can't.
[00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:27.366]  And it's here.
[00:14:27.987 --> 00:14:30.869]  And it's ahead of the killing of President Trump.
[00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.091]  Or the drugging of the President and claiming he's collapsed.
[00:14:34.732 --> 00:14:37.394]  They said a month ago, within two months, we're going to kill the President.
[00:14:37.414 --> 00:14:45.660]  And they said it on CNN, they said it on MSNBC, because they need to get the plot members to have confidence.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.704]  Let me play first for you, before we get into the hurricane and more, let me play you a clip
[00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:57.869]  of Maxine Waters yesterday saying we will go after Pence once Trump is impeached.
[00:14:57.909 --> 00:15:00.152]  Now, this is the most important thing I want to add here.
[00:15:01.613 --> 00:15:04.676]  The Paul Ryans and the John McCains will be the only people left.
[00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.899]  They'll still have a vestigial Republican Party for show only.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.661]  Kind of what it already was.
[00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:14.766]  But the Libertarians had a successful partial takeover of the Republican Party.
[00:15:16.277 --> 00:15:18.177]  I told you, don't worry that Ron Paul lost twice.
[00:15:18.477 --> 00:15:21.258]  We built that beachhead culturally, ideologically.
[00:15:21.318 --> 00:15:23.698]  We're going to win down the road with the populist movement.
[00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:25.359]  It came quicker than I thought.
[00:15:26.099 --> 00:15:27.079]  The elite are panicking.
[00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:28.840]  They admit globalism is unpopular.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.100]  All the world is unelected, unaccountable, super authoritarian.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:40.042]  By its very basis, by its very system of technocracy, it should be untenable and everyone should reject it.
[00:15:41.302 --> 00:15:45.783]  But WikiLeaks in the documents from the Democrats, it says, we're just going to use culture war.
[00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:47.979]  That's a way of saying race war.
[00:15:50.102 --> 00:15:53.486]  They say, the public's turned against us, they're coming together, what do we do?
[00:15:53.806 --> 00:15:59.413]  And the professor advises Podesta in psychological warfare to accelerate the culture clash.
[00:16:00.273 --> 00:16:01.295]  That's what this is!
[00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:07.041]  And Maxine Waters is there telling the troops, don't worry!
[00:16:07.878 --> 00:16:10.259]  We're going to get Trump, then we're going to get Pence.
[00:16:10.499 --> 00:16:23.547]  And the plan is to have a COG event, have Homeland Security come in with executive orders and deep state already in place, have a new election, suspend all the Republicans that got elected, state houses, you name it.
[00:16:23.927 --> 00:16:25.588]  You didn't elect them, Russians did.
[00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:32.792]  Any governors say no, send in the big red one.
[00:16:33.853 --> 00:16:34.813]  Send in regular army.
[00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:36.034]  That's all in the books now.
[00:16:37.102 --> 00:16:41.723]  And just overturn the Republican-Libertarian-Americana realignment.
[00:16:42.463 --> 00:16:43.083]  That's the plan.
[00:16:43.123 --> 00:16:44.583]  They intend to execute this.
[00:16:44.623 --> 00:16:50.944]  Now, I don't have to tell you that the prognosis for them successfully getting away with it are very low.
[00:16:51.264 --> 00:16:55.205]  But we still don't want to go down this road because it will tank the economy.
[00:16:55.885 --> 00:16:59.066]  And every time stuff like this happens in history, big wars start.
[00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:05.727]  The Democrats are so busy trying to make America bankrupt so they can consolidate it and get full control and sexualize your children and run your life.
[00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:13.308]  That they're not looking at North Korea they armed, China they armed, how Venezuela is collapsing, all the other stuff that's happening.
[00:17:13.988 --> 00:17:16.709]  They're not seeing the writing on the wall.
[00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:34.694]  So, here's Maxine Waters rallying the troops, but what the Republicans need to know is, they virtue signal, they go along with Trump's bad, how dare him, pardon, Opaio, the most vicious Nazi ever seen on earth, murderer of five billion children, all made up.
[00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:38.200]  They just keep piling on the ridiculous cartoon lies.
[00:17:38.941 --> 00:17:54.055]  Once they get Trump, they're coming for you because they know they've lost and there's a total realignment and they've made a conscious decision to go to pure authoritarianism and they're going to take the wealth, they're going to get rid of the middle class, they're going to dynamite any upward mobility.
[00:17:54.415 --> 00:17:56.217]  They know what they're doing.
[00:17:56.637 --> 00:17:57.638]  It's a power cult.
[00:18:00.307 --> 00:18:04.168]  Roger Stone's got sources, and so do I, inside the New York Times.
[00:18:04.308 --> 00:18:11.170]  And they're in these editorial meetings going, three, four months ago, we'll do the Russia narrative, then the race narrative, then the mentally ill narrative.
[00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.370]  They know it's all a lie.
[00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.211]  They're conscious liars.
[00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:18.872]  So here's a clip of Maxine Waters getting the troops ready.
[00:18:19.392 --> 00:18:28.735]  We think that not only can we connect the dots, and Mueller, who is our special counsel, will be able to connect the dots.
[00:18:30.374 --> 00:18:31.175]  Hit pause again.
[00:18:31.655 --> 00:18:32.676]  Did you hear that?
[00:18:33.056 --> 00:18:37.159]  Mueller, who's our special counsel.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.141]  He's ours.
[00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:41.723]  He covered for the Clintons, the Bushes, all of it.
[00:18:44.565 --> 00:18:52.812]  And now they're so-called dirty as did Trump cover for his son in a meeting looking for dirt on Hillary, which is totally legal.
[00:18:53.052 --> 00:18:53.652]  Let's continue.
[00:18:54.653 --> 00:18:58.096]  And so don't think that somehow if we
[00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:00.994]  Get this president impeached.
[00:19:01.214 --> 00:19:04.015]  We're going to be stuck with Pence and we can't do anything about it.
[00:19:04.415 --> 00:19:07.096]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the strength.
[00:19:07.796 --> 00:19:09.137]  We have the influence.
[00:19:09.377 --> 00:19:10.597]  We have the ability.
[00:19:10.797 --> 00:19:15.159]  We have the talent to do whatever we need to do, when we need to do.
[00:19:15.399 --> 00:19:16.619]  This is our country.
[00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:18.620]  We're paying a price for it.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.522]  We're going to come back and play this from the first, but gentlemen, we can rebuild it.
[00:19:24.537 --> 00:19:29.798]  The Democratic Party with its incredibly corrupt elites, pardoning cocaine dealers and child molesters.
[00:19:30.238 --> 00:19:31.299]  We can rebuild it.
[00:19:31.419 --> 00:19:31.739]  Bigger.
[00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:32.659]  Stronger.
[00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:33.479]  Faster.
[00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:34.739]  More piratical.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.900]  More rapacious.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.880]  More hateful.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:44.462]  And ladies and gentlemen, we're going to pave the way with... You see a white devil walking down the street, you stab him!
[00:19:45.442 --> 00:19:49.627]  Meanwhile, I got some powerful footage coming up of a guy I want to give a radio show to.
[00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:58.778]  I've seen this guy on YouTube a few times out there at the San Francisco rally pointing out that they're trying to start a race war and he just absolutely shoots the whole thing down.
[00:19:59.098 --> 00:19:59.639]  We'll be back.
[00:19:59.659 --> 00:20:00.139]  Stay with us.
[00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:11.728]  Well, he was the founder of Vice, syndicated radio TV host.
[00:20:11.788 --> 00:20:12.889]  Gavin McInnes is with us.
[00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:16.431]  He's got so many shows on so many platforms, I can't even go over it all.
[00:20:16.451 --> 00:20:18.172]  But he's compoundmedia.com.
[00:20:18.192 --> 00:20:20.093]  He's also, I guess, working with The Rebel.
[00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:22.094]  Twitter at Gavin underscore McInnes.
[00:20:22.534 --> 00:20:24.375]  And he joins us now.
[00:20:24.496 --> 00:20:28.178]  But he is a Swiss army knife of intellectual ideas.
[00:20:28.198 --> 00:20:31.560]  So, let's front and center my maestro.
[00:20:32.972 --> 00:20:46.061]  Well here's what I, I understand that politicians like Hillary, the DNC, I understand that they want to incentivize single moms and they want to shatter the black family so they can make more Americans dependent on them.
[00:20:46.281 --> 00:20:52.946]  What I'm obsessed with these days is how eager the populace is to assist these people.
[00:20:53.346 --> 00:20:57.268]  How eager they are to jump in bed with these people where they have no real gains.
[00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.670]  Exactly!
[00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:05.932]  If you're Roman soldiers taking over a town in Brittany and burning it, you get to rape the women, you get the gold.
[00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:08.292]  They're not even getting anything!
[00:21:08.332 --> 00:21:11.133]  They're screwing their own future, but it's VR.
[00:21:11.433 --> 00:21:12.934]  It's imaginary.
[00:21:13.929 --> 00:21:14.310]  Exactly.
[00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.654]  They're jumping next to the Roman soldiers and marching with them, saying, let's rape and pillage my town.
[00:21:20.175 --> 00:21:21.536]  And you go, well, that was easy.
[00:21:21.616 --> 00:21:24.499]  I mean, these people were thought policing ourselves.
[00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:30.424]  So the Gestapo, the Secret Service, they don't even have to show up for work to thought police us, because we'll do it.
[00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:32.086]  Like this Google Memo thing.
[00:21:32.626 --> 00:21:36.869]  That he was fired not just by the CEO, but by his peers.
[00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:39.831]  Forbes called it an anti-woman screed.
[00:21:40.792 --> 00:21:44.174]  You had Salon saying it confirms your worst fears.
[00:21:44.655 --> 00:21:50.539]  And they've just taken this fake narrative that he said women don't belong in the workforce, and they've exaggerated it.
[00:21:50.879 --> 00:21:53.042]  I don't think any of the media has even read it.
[00:21:53.122 --> 00:21:59.289]  And he was also saying he saw the future and he saw that he was about to get penalized for being male, which is illegal.
[00:21:59.749 --> 00:22:02.353]  And he was saying, hey, company, I want us all to work together.
[00:22:02.373 --> 00:22:04.856]  Women are a huge asset to the workforce.
[00:22:05.176 --> 00:22:06.197]  Sexism is bad.
[00:22:06.237 --> 00:22:07.118]  Equality is good.
[00:22:07.138 --> 00:22:11.163]  However, do we really need to demand every single
[00:22:11.203 --> 00:22:16.846]  Every single aspect, every single floor, every single cubicle of this building is 50% male, 50% female.
[00:22:16.866 --> 00:22:23.069]  Do they really need to all, do the coders, which is a very rare skill, do the coders all have to be 50% female?
[00:22:23.089 --> 00:22:25.970]  Because that's forcing women into a role.
[00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:26.670]  It's slavery.
[00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.191]  It's forcing them into the Foxconn factory in China.
[00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:30.072]  That's really what it is.
[00:22:30.992 --> 00:22:33.293]  Let's get George Costanza into the NBA.
[00:22:33.613 --> 00:22:36.534]  Let's get some short, fat Jewish guys playing NBA.
[00:22:36.694 --> 00:22:37.914]  The NBA is black.
[00:22:38.134 --> 00:22:38.614]  Sorry.
[00:22:39.215 --> 00:22:40.775]  The MLB is Hispanic.
[00:22:41.035 --> 00:22:41.455]  Sorry.
[00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:52.859]  I was about to say, I was an okay football player, but by the time I was a sophomore and they put me on varsity in a 5A team in Dallas, and huge black guys and white guys were running me over, I said, I quit.
[00:22:53.519 --> 00:22:54.140]  I have broken ribs.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.081]  They're like, well, you did some good tackles.
[00:22:56.121 --> 00:22:57.462]  I'm like, dude, I'm done.
[00:22:57.802 --> 00:23:00.704]  And again, it wasn't like I was mad that most of the guys running over me were black.
[00:23:00.984 --> 00:23:02.125]  It was just, that's the way it was.
[00:23:04.483 --> 00:23:13.153]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[00:23:13.213 --> 00:23:13.693]  That's right.
[00:23:13.753 --> 00:23:18.759]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.
[00:23:19.019 --> 00:23:25.446]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[00:23:25.686 --> 00:23:32.992]  And let me tell you, son, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[00:23:33.272 --> 00:23:33.452]  Woo!
[00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:34.433]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:23:34.553 --> 00:23:43.160]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:51.406]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:23:52.867 --> 00:23:56.190]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.273]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[00:24:00.433 --> 00:24:01.334]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:24:01.514 --> 00:24:04.136]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:24:12.342 --> 00:24:14.504]  We are on the march.
[00:24:14.864 --> 00:24:17.286]  The empire is on the run.
[00:24:18.007 --> 00:24:21.730]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:26.664 --> 00:24:39.337]  Well, Maxine Waters gave a speech yesterday where she said, we're going to get Trump, then we're going to get Pence, and we're basically just going to have whole new elections and remove the Republican Party, because the whole party is basically Russian agents.
[00:24:39.437 --> 00:24:39.897]  That's right.
[00:24:39.957 --> 00:24:46.224]  The dying Democratic Party now wants to end all competition and declare everybody a Russian agent and or
[00:24:46.844 --> 00:24:53.605]  A, quote, vicious Nazi or vicious white supremacist when they're the ones pushing the whole race narrative.
[00:24:53.846 --> 00:25:01.427]  But she admits early on the speech that Robert Mueller is our, our special counsel.
[00:25:01.687 --> 00:25:10.449]  Well, we know that they've worked for the Democrats and helped cover up, you name it, and almost everybody he's appointed is a Democrat, including folks that Trump has fired.
[00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:14.690]  So here she is tipping her hand and admitting
[00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.152]  They intend to create a one-party dictatorship.
[00:25:20.013 --> 00:25:33.140]  We think that not only can we connect the dots, and Mueller, who is our special counsel, will be able to connect the dots, O. Pence may have some involvement in some of this too.
[00:25:33.661 --> 00:25:37.103]  And so don't think that somehow if we
[00:25:38.047 --> 00:25:40.008]  Get this president impeached.
[00:25:40.228 --> 00:25:43.030]  We're going to be stuck with Pence and we can't do anything about it.
[00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.112]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the strength.
[00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:48.153]  We have the influence.
[00:25:48.393 --> 00:25:49.614]  We have the ability.
[00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:54.176]  We have the talent to do whatever we need to do, when we need to do.
[00:25:54.416 --> 00:25:55.537]  This is our country.
[00:25:55.557 --> 00:25:55.877]  That's right.
[00:25:55.897 --> 00:25:56.978]  We have the criminal energy.
[00:25:57.538 --> 00:25:59.600]  And we're not going to let Trump or anyone else deny it.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.742]  And of course, when you hear the haters,
[00:26:12.316 --> 00:26:18.840]  And my enemies, and your enemies say, I think she's premature in talking about impeachment.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.301]  We have to wait, you better start the discussion.
[00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:26.584]  You better provide some leadership, because I think the dots are going to be connected.
[00:26:27.104 --> 00:26:29.585]  I believe sincerely there was collusion.
[00:26:30.045 --> 00:26:36.209]  Not only have our intelligence agencies said to us, yes, they absolutely
[00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:37.650]  I don't know.
[00:26:53.536 --> 00:26:54.097]  Hannafort?
[00:26:54.777 --> 00:26:55.838]  Manafort, rather?
[00:26:55.958 --> 00:26:57.279]  Are we talking about Glenn?
[00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:58.500]  Or Wilbur Ross?
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.682]  Are we talking about Carter Page?
[00:27:01.042 --> 00:27:06.206]  Are we talking about any of the rest of them that I have dubbed the Kremlin clan?
[00:27:06.847 --> 00:27:10.169]  They all think that they're going to get multi-rich.
[00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.651]  She's the globalist overthrowing America and then she says it's Putin.
[00:27:38.922 --> 00:27:44.107]  From doing what he really wants to do, and that is reunite the entire Soviet Union.
[00:27:44.427 --> 00:27:45.948]  He is an egomaniac.
[00:27:46.429 --> 00:27:50.393]  But of course, he's an egomaniac heading Russia.
[00:27:50.693 --> 00:27:54.256]  And we've got another one heading the United States of America.
[00:27:55.657 --> 00:28:04.786]  So everybody's an egomaniac, but Maxine Waters that thinks that Putin invaded Korea, where Aleppo is located.
[00:28:06.687 --> 00:28:09.107]  Now, I'm going to show you some footage if you're a radio listener.
[00:28:09.127 --> 00:28:10.968]  I'm going to describe this to you.
[00:28:11.008 --> 00:28:16.469]  This is just some of the countless videos we've got of them chasing down a man at a prayer meeting because he was white.
[00:28:16.709 --> 00:28:17.649]  It's white people doing it.
[00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:26.751]  Attacking him and spitting on him over and over and over and over again.
[00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:30.852]  During the break, I was just in there watching the footage again.
[00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:32.270]  And
[00:28:47.113 --> 00:28:52.838]  Just rain spit on them, giggling and smirking and laughing while the guy's praying to Jesus.
[00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:59.864]  And then they cut to a woman on CBS saying, well, I'm scared of Nazis, so it's good to make them scared.
[00:29:00.245 --> 00:29:03.848]  Because they just say you're a Nazi, now you're allowed to be beaten up.
[00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:04.549]  See how that works?
[00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:06.751]  No, you can't let people beat up a Nazi.
[00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:11.175]  Even if you don't like them, they have a right to free speech, because then, next, all of your rights
[00:29:12.236 --> 00:29:16.838]  Are taken away and CBS News in this piece says it's okay.
[00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.600]  Says it's okay to beat these people up.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.841]  They don't have swastikas on their arms.
[00:29:23.121 --> 00:29:25.122]  They don't have any white supremacist regalia.
[00:29:25.503 --> 00:29:27.984]  They're wearing Donald Trump hats.
[00:29:28.524 --> 00:29:38.349]  And so they get beaten up by mobs of cowardly gangs of just total lawless, lost, stupid, moronic
[00:29:40.091 --> 00:29:41.031]  Ugly people, too.
[00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:42.772]  I mean, you go look at these leftist demonstrations.
[00:29:43.212 --> 00:29:49.834]  These are the most soul-sucked, dried-out, dried-up-looking, run-over roadkill.
[00:29:50.094 --> 00:29:51.174]  And I'm not saying that mean.
[00:29:51.434 --> 00:29:52.734]  Something's wrong with these people.
[00:29:52.754 --> 00:29:53.574]  We're on the march.
[00:29:54.075 --> 00:29:55.675]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.615 --> 00:29:59.296]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.673 --> 00:30:16.297]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[00:30:16.497 --> 00:30:18.899]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[00:30:19.059 --> 00:30:22.361]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[00:30:22.521 --> 00:30:24.663]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[00:30:24.723 --> 00:30:29.346]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[00:30:29.546 --> 00:30:32.308]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[00:30:32.428 --> 00:30:36.630]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[00:30:39.532 --> 00:30:40.353]  Unprecedented.
[00:30:40.433 --> 00:30:41.494]  And it's cold-pressed.
[00:30:41.654 --> 00:30:43.575]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[00:30:43.595 --> 00:30:51.941]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science and these are other... What you sell, BuzzFeed said, is already best-selling stuff that's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:53.182]  Why, these aren't anything new.
[00:30:53.202 --> 00:30:57.285]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[00:30:57.465 --> 00:30:57.906]  Duh.
[00:30:57.926 --> 00:30:57.986]  Duh.
[00:31:04.676 --> 00:31:08.217]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:31:08.677 --> 00:31:14.718]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:31:15.118 --> 00:31:17.919]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:21.300]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.941]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:31:25.281 --> 00:31:25.741]  The left
[00:31:26.081 --> 00:31:27.021]  ...controls culture.
[00:31:27.061 --> 00:31:28.042]  They control arts.
[00:31:28.102 --> 00:31:29.322]  They control entertainment.
[00:31:29.622 --> 00:31:36.704]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:36.764 --> 00:31:39.164]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:31:39.644 --> 00:31:43.505]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:31:43.565 --> 00:31:45.626]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate...
[00:31:46.266 --> 00:31:51.647]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:31:51.888 --> 00:31:58.149]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:31:58.209 --> 00:31:59.910]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.250]  It's available right now.
[00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.731]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.

[00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:09.306]  For the last two years, I've been saying there's an attack on white people in America.
[00:33:09.646 --> 00:33:13.652]  If you go out and you say you're a Trump supporter today, you're automatically racist.
[00:33:13.712 --> 00:33:13.913]  Why?
[00:33:13.933 --> 00:33:14.714]  Because you're white.
[00:33:14.774 --> 00:33:16.777]  Right now, the war is the Infowar.
[00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:18.981]  That's the war that we're in right now.
[00:33:33.823 --> 00:33:41.013]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:56.248]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:33:56.288 --> 00:33:58.169]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:34:16.964 --> 00:34:17.572]  Alex Jones!
[00:34:20.168 --> 00:34:29.294]  The number one most hated transmission globally by tyrants, communists, authoritarians, pedophiles, devil worshippers, radical Islamists, you name it.
[00:34:29.895 --> 00:34:43.304]  Well, President Trump landed about 15 minutes ago in Corpus Christi, Texas, right in the epicenter of where this mega hurricane, Category 3, when it came on shore, hit last Friday.
[00:34:43.804 --> 00:34:48.168]  Upwards of 80 inches of rain in some places, over 60 inches of rain in Houston,
[00:34:48.948 --> 00:34:54.309]  They're facing 20 more inches are what the meteorologists are saying right now.
[00:34:54.729 --> 00:34:58.570]  We've got reporters in the field on the ground.
[00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.371]  They're going to be joining us later in the broadcast.
[00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:08.093]  Also, we're going to have Sheriff Joe Arpaio on exclusively after the pardon.
[00:35:09.822 --> 00:35:10.242]  I think?
[00:35:29.451 --> 00:35:30.711]  Delegates being stolen.
[00:35:31.531 --> 00:35:33.532]  The primary being stolen from Bernie Sanders.
[00:35:33.792 --> 00:35:36.753]  That's been thrown out of court by a federal judge.
[00:35:36.773 --> 00:35:40.494]  The judge said, yes, the Democratic Party is allowed to choose.
[00:35:41.094 --> 00:35:44.374]  The voting in primaries is ceremonial.
[00:35:45.275 --> 00:35:46.535]  Ceremonial.
[00:35:46.915 --> 00:35:52.256]  We ought to cue up those tapes from back in the primaries last year, about a year ago now.
[00:35:52.916 --> 00:35:54.677]  We ought to go dig those out.
[00:35:56.030 --> 00:36:01.794]  Because remember the Republican leadership on CNN and Fox going, listen, it's always been ceremonial.
[00:36:01.834 --> 00:36:05.777]  George Will said, a mere plurality, a majority of votes doesn't count.
[00:36:06.077 --> 00:36:08.779]  It is we and the party hierarchy that will decide.
[00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:14.243]  Well, let's just give you a crown and a scepter and an orb and a groom of the stool, bro.
[00:36:15.424 --> 00:36:16.425]  What a joke!
[00:36:16.965 --> 00:36:18.346]  With that stupid toupee!
[00:36:18.926 --> 00:36:21.548]  But oh, you're so intellectual because you talk slow.
[00:36:21.948 --> 00:36:23.670]  You're so smart, George Will.
[00:36:25.208 --> 00:36:28.170]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:40.336]  Now, before I go any further here, I've got news here that makes me physically sick, but it's got to be covered.
[00:36:40.597 --> 00:36:47.040]  And when I do cover it, it's very hard for me to get through.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.762]  That's why I mentioned it yesterday, but I didn't cover it.
[00:36:50.822 --> 00:36:51.543]  Now we have more
[00:36:53.672 --> 00:37:12.759]  More details, and when you know the back story of why they did it, the minute I saw the headline two days ago, that's when I first saw it, was Sunday night in the Times of London, linked up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, I knew what the story was going to be.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.502]  Because I've seen it before and I've had two members of Parliament on, who by the way are Liberals, who've been exposing this in the UK.
[00:37:20.791 --> 00:37:23.773]  It's a giant business, it's a racket, and it's so sick.
[00:37:24.133 --> 00:37:29.416]  Christian children are literally fed into the economic systems of the Muslims.
[00:37:30.837 --> 00:37:32.018]  Because it's a system of slavery.
[00:37:32.118 --> 00:37:33.899]  Slavery is alive and well.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.121]  So that's coming up.
[00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:46.347]  And I'm gonna get into North Korea and that escalation and... You know, I don't want to bash Joel Osteen because I've said it many times.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.601]  It's okay to be positive.
[00:37:50.621 --> 00:37:51.962]  A lot of people have chips on their shoulder.
[00:37:51.982 --> 00:37:53.083]  They're being too negative.
[00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:57.067]  I cover negative things so we can be positive and fix them.
[00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:58.689]  Not just so we can be victims.
[00:37:58.709 --> 00:37:59.249]  There's a difference.
[00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.631]  So, okay.
[00:38:01.431 --> 00:38:02.112]  Name it and claim it.
[00:38:02.152 --> 00:38:04.494]  It's kind of like voodoo or magical thinking.
[00:38:05.115 --> 00:38:09.839]  But just at a base, instinctive level, he comes off as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:38:13.129 --> 00:38:14.669]  And he's for people that are highly suggestible.
[00:38:15.009 --> 00:38:27.092]  But I said a big test would be if they opened up their church that is above water, we've checked, and sent in their resources of hundreds of millions of dollars a year to house people.
[00:38:29.593 --> 00:38:36.374]  And it'd be a good PR stunt for him to begin with, but see, a sociopath or a psychopath cannot actually give, they can only take.
[00:38:39.615 --> 00:38:40.275]  So he said,
[00:38:43.496 --> 00:38:45.057]  He said, we're not gonna help you.
[00:38:46.739 --> 00:38:49.281]  He said, you need to lean on your faith.
[00:38:51.222 --> 00:38:53.444]  Well, see, magical thinking is just that, magical.
[00:38:53.464 --> 00:39:05.734]  If you believe in something, if you have the capability to do it, if civilization, your ancestors have built a platform of their dreams, exponentially, with a human mind that's so incredible, that now we are close to being able to manifest things.
[00:39:07.355 --> 00:39:10.598]  But through what we built, not abracadabra, hocus pocus,
[00:39:11.633 --> 00:39:13.736]  Diplodocus, and then something just appears.
[00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:18.143]  And I am so ashamed.
[00:39:18.203 --> 00:39:19.585]  I've got his quotes, his tweets here.
[00:39:20.366 --> 00:39:22.189]  He just said, nope, church is closed.
[00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:23.591]  Pray to God.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:35.926]  I couldn't even keep Michael Zimmerman and Clinton Carter and other members of my crew from getting in their own trucks, one of them in one of my trucks, and driving down there.
[00:39:36.306 --> 00:39:37.727]  People are now rushing boats.
[00:39:37.807 --> 00:39:38.868]  It's a huge disaster.
[00:39:39.168 --> 00:39:40.649]  Things are really deteriorating quickly.
[00:39:41.009 --> 00:39:42.950]  Trump has given Texas everything they've asked for.
[00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.131]  He's been totally on top of it.
[00:39:44.491 --> 00:39:48.834]  But the Democrats didn't even tell folks that were in low-lying areas to go to higher ground.
[00:39:49.315 --> 00:39:53.697]  And you're supposed to, under the regulations and the laws, to start locally with that.
[00:39:53.798 --> 00:39:57.480]  People listened to the mayor saying, no problem, it's nonsensical.
[00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:02.462]  And so now things have really, really deteriorated.
[00:40:02.522 --> 00:40:04.742]  There are looters shooting at rescue folks.
[00:40:04.843 --> 00:40:07.243]  There are people shooting at the private citizens going in.
[00:40:07.263 --> 00:40:08.164]  They're shooting at the cops.
[00:40:08.524 --> 00:40:09.904]  The police have confirmed this.
[00:40:11.205 --> 00:40:12.505]  And I didn't even want to race bait.
[00:40:12.745 --> 00:40:15.046]  I saw it on Twitter two nights ago and again today.
[00:40:15.726 --> 00:40:17.327]  It's got the racist black gangs.
[00:40:18.852 --> 00:40:24.794]  Are there saying, you know, look at what we looted, look at what we got, they're putting it out on Twitter and, you know, we're robbing the white folks, they deserve it.
[00:40:25.314 --> 00:40:28.575]  And then of course there's black folks helping white folks and white folks helping black folks.
[00:40:28.936 --> 00:40:31.256]  It's a very small minority of scum that's doing this.
[00:40:31.997 --> 00:40:38.679]  But, can you imagine if there were white people robbing black neighborhoods right now?
[00:40:38.959 --> 00:40:41.060]  And you know, I'm sure, I bet some of that actually goes on.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.141]  The point is, is that this is so incredible.
[00:40:45.661 --> 00:40:47.442]  Because I don't want to demonize Olsteen, but see,
[00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:59.848]  You look at somebody that's just so into being Mr. Perfect, and there's never a problem, and there's never an issue, and everything's gonna be just fine, and so he just, everything's fine!
[00:41:00.088 --> 00:41:09.050]  You, no, don't come near my megachurch that's bigger than sports stadiums, that's got all the food and all the water and everything, and don't even use my parking lot as an emergency center, cause it's dry.
[00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:14.871]  Just know it's private property, security's there, don't come around, we're gonna be closed the next few weeks, okay?
[00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:19.632]  Cause, just pray to the Lord, just lean on your faith.
[00:41:22.657 --> 00:41:28.860]  So I'm going to get to this really sick article in a minute, but Joel Osteen shuts Mega Church amid flooding crisis.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:29.981]  New York Post.
[00:41:30.441 --> 00:41:38.825]  Televangelist Joel Osteen canceled services at his Houston Mega Church Sunday and has yet to reopen his doors, despite the fact that thousands of flooded out residents are desperately seeking shelter.
[00:41:39.005 --> 00:41:40.406]  And again, you always go where?
[00:41:40.686 --> 00:41:44.188]  To a church when there's a flood or a hurricane or a tornado.
[00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:49.230]  But you don't go to Osteen's because it's not a church.
[00:41:49.631 --> 00:41:52.192]  It's a big vampire worship facility.
[00:41:55.836 --> 00:42:02.561]  The perpetually smiling pastor told followers on Twitter Monday to lean on their faith.
[00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.884]  Jesus promises us peace that passes understanding, he wrote.
[00:42:07.344 --> 00:42:09.406]  That's peace when it doesn't make sense.
[00:42:11.347 --> 00:42:11.687]  Gotta love it.
[00:42:11.907 --> 00:42:12.448]  Mind control.
[00:42:12.768 --> 00:42:14.969]  It's like Tulsa Doom in Caught in the Barbarian.
[00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:17.311]  It goes, steel isn't strong, boy.
[00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:18.592]  Flesh is strong.
[00:42:19.092 --> 00:42:20.854]  Look at that girl up there on the cliffside.
[00:42:21.214 --> 00:42:21.674]  Come to me.
[00:42:22.475 --> 00:42:23.395]  Come to me, my child.
[00:42:23.415 --> 00:42:25.477]  And then she just jumps off and falls to her death.
[00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.052]  Steel isn't strong, boy.
[00:42:30.312 --> 00:42:31.254]  Flesh is strong.
[00:42:32.215 --> 00:42:33.536]  Mind control is strong.
[00:42:34.438 --> 00:42:36.020]  And the day of doom has come!
[00:42:37.671 --> 00:42:47.059]  We'll have the Democrats praising the Republican written bill, Obamacare, admittedly to screw them, with the architects of it on TV going, thank God you're so stupid.
[00:42:47.699 --> 00:42:58.247]  And then you'll go out and find some Christian group demonstrating for free speech, and you'll spit on them, and club them in the head, and beat them up, and the media will praise it.
[00:42:59.669 --> 00:43:02.291]  But when it happens in Charlottesville, even though you started the fight,
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.603]  Still, everyone who's conservative, by extension, is guilty.
[00:43:08.904 --> 00:43:15.509]  I can play you the CBS News piece where they're spitting on people, beating folks, and they're saying, well, they deserve it on CBS!
[00:43:15.569 --> 00:43:23.555]  Let me tell you, I'm driving along and some crowd will try to drag me and my family out of my vehicle.
[00:43:25.597 --> 00:43:28.899]  I guess I'm just going to let them kill us, because they're God and I'm a bad person.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.601]  Here's my neck, here, slit it.
[00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:33.351]  Okay, just scream Nazi while you do it.
[00:43:33.371 --> 00:43:33.992]  It'll be okay.
[00:43:34.492 --> 00:43:35.333]  Have your coming of age.
[00:43:35.973 --> 00:43:41.097]  Meanwhile, Jesus promises his peace and passes understanding.
[00:43:42.498 --> 00:43:44.819]  That peace, when it doesn't make sense.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:54.646]  Oh, but you have the resources of the rich man with the facility, and you supposedly are open to the flock, and then they're all drowned, and it's like, just pray to God.
[00:43:55.387 --> 00:43:57.928]  I'm on a $25 million house with armed security.
[00:43:58.969 --> 00:43:59.890]  I have my glitterbug wife.
[00:44:01.164 --> 00:44:10.647]  But Osteen's comforting words didn't sit well with critics who want to know why the doors to his 16,000 seat arena and his Lakewood church near downtown Houston are closed.
[00:44:11.427 --> 00:44:15.068]  You have taken so much money away from people to live like a king.
[00:44:15.088 --> 00:44:19.129]  Entertainment publicist Danny Breeden blasted, is this the least you can do?
[00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:22.490]  And again, these sociopaths don't get it.
[00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:27.132]  If he would have simply done the right thing, he'd have gotten even more successful.
[00:44:29.793 --> 00:44:33.715]  It doesn't make sense when you're not opening up your megachurch to house Houston citizens.
[00:44:33.755 --> 00:44:34.495]  Help me understand that.
[00:44:36.035 --> 00:44:46.179]  According to Florida-based Ryder, while the church and its arena have not suffered any flood damage, ministry spokesman Donald Olof said that the property is inaccessible because of surrounding waters.
[00:44:46.679 --> 00:44:52.882]  And it makes no sense to open church doors when the city and county are already treating thousands of flood victims.
[00:44:53.362 --> 00:44:56.243]  I want our reporters, because I've got a map, in fact, in there.
[00:44:56.483 --> 00:44:57.944]  Pull up a satellite map of that.
[00:44:58.604 --> 00:45:00.164]  And then call our reporters, Zimmerman.
[00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:04.865]  I want them to go to that church, because I've driven by the church, I've seen it.
[00:45:05.305 --> 00:45:09.926]  They've got highways that pull right off into it, and I believe that's not true.
[00:45:09.946 --> 00:45:14.027]  Because the waters are higher than they were yesterday when they said this.
[00:45:14.247 --> 00:45:21.529]  So I want to go see if that little devil, oh I'm sorry, that little angel, that little name it and claim it,
[00:45:23.783 --> 00:45:27.085]  That little, believe in me, I'll give you nothing, I'll be your guru.
[00:45:27.386 --> 00:45:29.327]  You know, the modern spirit is so satanic.
[00:45:30.088 --> 00:45:39.854]  Everybody's a guru, everybody's a shaman, everybody's just going to tell you how clean and good and positive they are, and they're not going to lift a finger for anybody, and they're going to get ahead.
[00:45:39.874 --> 00:45:46.299]  And then they always wonder why they have so much destruction in their lives, because they're trying to avoid conflict.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.423]  I'm not looking for pointless conflict, but I'm looking to confront corruption.
[00:45:52.864 --> 00:45:55.285]  Why have we not put out some type of donation page?
[00:45:55.765 --> 00:46:03.727]  I'm still trying to figure out the right group and the right charity, and I'm asking my crews down there, fishing people out of the water, and drawing attention to this.
[00:46:05.167 --> 00:46:05.787]  Who's the best group?
[00:46:05.807 --> 00:46:06.747]  Maybe Salvation Army?
[00:46:06.767 --> 00:46:09.128]  90% of the money you give them gets to the people.
[00:46:09.428 --> 00:46:10.308]  They're always on the scene.
[00:46:10.328 --> 00:46:11.249]  I think that's probably good.
[00:46:12.389 --> 00:46:13.709]  We should probably put some links up to them.
[00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.909]  Some local churches.
[00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.910]  We need to find a group of churches.
[00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:17.830]  My crew's there.
[00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:18.790]  They're actually helping folks.
[00:46:19.951 --> 00:46:20.971]  Got people staying in them.
[00:46:22.432 --> 00:46:23.853]  Lots of little churches are full of people.
[00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:25.633]  Let's just find some churches and help them.
[00:46:26.214 --> 00:46:26.954]  So that's the mission.
[00:46:26.974 --> 00:46:27.774]  Please call the crew.
[00:46:28.354 --> 00:46:34.437]  Call Clinton and call Mike, Michael, and tell him, go find me real churches to donate to.
[00:46:34.457 --> 00:46:35.917]  We already had this discussion this morning.
[00:46:35.937 --> 00:46:36.698]  It's probably already been done.
[00:46:37.038 --> 00:46:38.438]  And then get over there to that church.
[00:46:39.499 --> 00:46:42.980]  Get over there to that mega church and see if it's inaccessible.
[00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:49.383]  And if Olsteen's telling the truth, well, we'll tell everybody.
[00:46:50.299 --> 00:46:57.044]  Oh, but if you're coming up to the floodwaters, people fighting to get on boats, boats being basically pulled under, folks trying to get on board, but don't come here!
[00:46:57.064 --> 00:46:57.765]  We got security!
[00:46:58.185 --> 00:46:59.206]  This is off-limits!
[00:47:00.107 --> 00:47:05.431]  Let folks save you over there in the boats, let churches save you over there, and let the Mexican neighborhood save people coming out.
[00:47:05.671 --> 00:47:11.356]  Let everybody help everybody, but don't come to the Glitterbug Palace!
[00:47:19.926 --> 00:47:22.027]  But now Olsteen has done the right thing.
[00:47:23.987 --> 00:47:25.748]  There's been a backlash that just came out.
[00:47:26.908 --> 00:47:29.149]  And now they're saying, OK, we'll issue air mattresses.
[00:47:29.469 --> 00:47:29.809]  So see?
[00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:32.850]  I guess they were accessible.
[00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:35.151]  We're going to go investigate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:40.393 --> 00:47:42.953]  But Joel Olsteen isn't the only glitter bug around here.
[00:47:44.234 --> 00:47:44.674]  Look at this.
[00:47:45.967 --> 00:47:49.769]  Professor Harvey is karma for Texas voting Trump.
[00:47:50.409 --> 00:47:55.352]  Again, we'll put up on screen for you some footage of Trump surveying the damage.
[00:47:55.392 --> 00:48:01.835]  He just got here about 30 minutes ago, landing at the landfall point of Hurricane Harvey Friday.
[00:48:03.456 --> 00:48:08.659]  Corpus Christi, Texas and nearby Rockport, where the center of the storm made landfall.
[00:48:10.442 --> 00:48:15.145]  And, the governor's done a great job, the state guard's done a great job, the state police's done a great job, R.J.
[00:48:15.165 --> 00:48:27.892]  Cervantes' police force is doing a great job, the citizens are doing a great job, the Cajun Navy's doing a great job, but the mayor made fun of people saying get the high ground.
[00:48:27.932 --> 00:48:30.874]  He's done a terrible, condescending, evil job.
[00:48:32.095 --> 00:48:35.817]  And the folks shooting at the Cajun Navy are disgusting.
[00:48:37.618 --> 00:48:38.759]  Now, before we go any further,
[00:48:40.316 --> 00:48:42.159]  With the really important story.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:48.168]  Parents begged UK authorities to house Christian child with grandparents, not hardline Muslims.
[00:48:48.608 --> 00:48:55.378]  But the mayor has been convicted of directing money of children that were taken.
[00:48:56.735 --> 00:48:57.495]  Two Muslims!
[00:48:58.136 --> 00:49:01.157]  And it turns out, basically, it's Muslims that get your kids.
[00:49:02.517 --> 00:49:11.301]  Then they sit there on their welfare heinies, with their enslaved women wearing burqas that get acid poured on their face, if they don't step and fetch when they're told.
[00:49:11.701 --> 00:49:14.182]  They got all the weird leftists allied with them, protecting them.
[00:49:16.843 --> 00:49:18.384]  And the little girl had her cross taken.
[00:49:19.423 --> 00:49:21.865]  Told she's going to hell because she's a Christian, all the rest of it.
[00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:22.805]  And it's all confirmed.
[00:49:22.845 --> 00:49:25.087]  Even the social workers say, please give her back.
[00:49:25.387 --> 00:49:26.327]  Her grandmother's nice.
[00:49:26.387 --> 00:49:27.108]  The parents are nice.
[00:49:27.148 --> 00:49:27.908]  Why'd you take them?
[00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:40.036]  And the mayor is like, the impure will be dealt with.
[00:49:41.437 --> 00:49:42.258]  And I had a leftist...
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.421]  Newspaper writer on the phone with me this morning.
[00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:47.381]  Famous one.
[00:49:47.721 --> 00:49:50.422]  And I said, just say it's wrong they're taking people's kids.
[00:49:51.202 --> 00:49:52.162]  He wouldn't even respond.
[00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:54.003]  I don't know about that, Alex.
[00:49:54.563 --> 00:50:03.986]  Well, just say it's wrong that... The ACLU said they apologize for showing a white child on their website.
[00:50:04.026 --> 00:50:04.646]  That's offensive.
[00:50:05.406 --> 00:50:06.667]  I guess it's a little bit off.
[00:50:08.647 --> 00:50:11.008]  These globalists know exactly what they're doing.
[00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:11.828]  Full.
[00:50:12.189 --> 00:50:12.629]  Total.
[00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:13.349]  Takeover.
[00:50:15.609 --> 00:50:26.059]  Now we've got a limited time specials that are running for just a few more days because we're not getting more Super Mel Vitality and it looks like until October and so this sale is too popular.
[00:50:27.584 --> 00:50:38.768]  57% off, we've never gone below 45%, and it's a bestseller, but I want you to see, especially if you haven't taken it, why it's got thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:50:39.208 --> 00:50:44.350]  An average of 4.6 out of almost 4,000 reviews unheard of on third-party sites.
[00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:46.590]  That's because it's amazing, it's cold-pressed.
[00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:54.113]  Find out, you owe it to yourself, and you owe it to this transmission that is fearless in the face of the globalist, public enemy number one, InfoWars.
[00:50:54.693 --> 00:50:56.736]  We're the enemy of the pedophiles and the rest of them.
[00:50:56.757 --> 00:51:02.145]  InfoWorksStore.com, 45% off on Selenium and on X2 and other specials.
[00:51:11.445 --> 00:51:13.706]  Michael Malice is our guest.
[00:51:14.586 --> 00:51:16.566]  He has traveled to North Korea repeatedly.
[00:51:16.586 --> 00:51:17.806]  He's written a best-selling book.
[00:51:17.966 --> 00:51:29.229]  Fiction couldn't make up, uh, it the clown creature like Kim Jong-un, strutting around like a hobbled tyrannosaurus feeding on humanity.
[00:51:29.529 --> 00:51:33.670]  I hate Kim Jong-un, but the poor people, it's like, what do we do?
[00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.790]  You've been there.
[00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.171]  I mean, these people are literally on another planet.
[00:51:37.251 --> 00:51:37.751]  What do we do?
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.242]  I mean, there's no easy answer.
[00:51:41.522 --> 00:51:46.845]  The only thing we can do is put pressure on China, and China has started to buckle, which is a very good sign.
[00:51:47.125 --> 00:51:50.528]  It's easy for North Korea when it's us versus them, when it's the U.S.
[00:51:50.568 --> 00:51:52.489]  imperialists, as they call us, versus them.
[00:51:52.889 --> 00:51:58.653]  But now when you have the international community uniting, including their big brother China, that's a very different dynamic.
[00:51:58.973 --> 00:52:02.555]  And it's a better dynamic, because why is this our problem entirely?
[00:52:02.595 --> 00:52:03.436]  And you're an expert on this.
[00:52:03.476 --> 00:52:05.697]  Let's talk about the North Korean-China relationship.
[00:52:05.737 --> 00:52:07.819]  Why has China been going along with this for 50 years?
[00:52:08.639 --> 00:52:10.401]  China doesn't want a U.S.
[00:52:10.501 --> 00:52:11.442]  ally on their border.
[00:52:11.983 --> 00:52:17.949]  China doesn't want 25 million North Korean refugees crossing the river and living in China where they have nothing to offer.
[00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:25.276]  And China basically doesn't... No one wants a collapsed state on their border that they have to basically deal with the problem.
[00:52:25.356 --> 00:52:27.138]  I mean, are we closer to midnight than ever?
[00:52:27.158 --> 00:52:30.962]  Because most experts I talk to say if there's nuclear war, it's going to start in North Korea, not the Middle East.
[00:52:31.423 --> 00:52:33.345]  Not in Ukraine, not on the border of Russia.
[00:52:33.665 --> 00:52:36.388]  I mean, what do you think of the experts you talk to?
[00:52:37.089 --> 00:52:39.071]  Because, I mean, you're all over the place talking to top experts.
[00:52:39.512 --> 00:52:40.973]  I mean, how serious is this?
[00:52:41.013 --> 00:52:41.734]  I got four children.
[00:52:41.754 --> 00:52:42.075]  I want to know.
[00:52:43.221 --> 00:52:44.302]  I think it's good.
[00:52:44.322 --> 00:52:45.042]  Your kids are fine.
[00:52:45.383 --> 00:52:46.143]  Your kids are safe.
[00:52:46.944 --> 00:52:52.647]  North Korea, in their literature, constantly talk about the fact, we know we can't win.
[00:52:53.268 --> 00:52:55.089]  They say this explicitly.
[00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:59.892]  So they're not... Listen, everyone talks about how he's crazy and suicidal.
[00:53:00.112 --> 00:53:01.273]  He's satanic, like you said.
[00:53:01.593 --> 00:53:04.215]  If he's suicidal, they've been around for 70 years.
[00:53:04.455 --> 00:53:06.236]  That's taken a long time to kill yourself, huh?
[00:53:06.436 --> 00:53:07.817]  Alex, you touched on it earlier.
[00:53:07.877 --> 00:53:10.879]  They have something called the monolithic ideological system.
[00:53:10.879 --> 00:53:11.139]  I think?
[00:53:32.394 --> 00:53:35.576]  And that without the leader, basically, no one would exist.
[00:53:35.756 --> 00:53:40.639]  So, it's a very dark quasi-religion that they push on the people.
[00:53:40.659 --> 00:53:49.264]  And again, when you're this demigod at the head of a country, and you're effectively a billionaire, what would it take for you to, you know, quit your job?
[00:53:49.584 --> 00:53:50.624]  It's going to take a lot.
[00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:54.787]  And it's going to take a combination of threats and rewards.
[00:53:55.467 --> 00:53:58.849]  And Kim Jong-un doesn't want to go the way of Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein.
[00:54:26.957 --> 00:54:48.492]  So, it was about five years ago that I saw some London Independent articles and London Telegraph articles, both with liberal members of the Labour Party, saying, we're bringing in foreigners, mainly Muslims, and they're now the social workers and the foster care people, and we're taking people's children for almost no reason.
[00:54:49.921 --> 00:54:54.587]  And we are giving them in these townships where the local city council controls it.
[00:54:54.868 --> 00:54:56.430]  The town council as it's called in England.
[00:54:57.171 --> 00:55:03.999]  And it's a business and the Muslims are over 70% on welfare in Germany and in England.
[00:55:05.345 --> 00:55:16.927]  The women are on welfare, the men drive taxi cabs or have shops or businesses, and then they use those for criminal fronts, drugs, you name it, because prostitution drugs can be sold to the cappers.
[00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:23.909]  And people probably heard that as a racist term from South Africa, but it's really an Islamic term meaning outsider.
[00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:30.850]  And they then literally just take over.
[00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:34.611]  And so then the children are taken from Brits.
[00:55:35.711 --> 00:55:40.112]  But also from other immigrants and given to the Muslims to raise.
[00:55:41.072 --> 00:55:42.132]  You can't make this up.
[00:55:43.832 --> 00:55:49.793]  This is out of the Sunday Times of London, Breitbart's got a more extensive article on it.
[00:55:50.193 --> 00:55:54.314]  This is the social workers, okay, liberal social workers are decrying this.
[00:55:54.734 --> 00:55:59.835]  Parents begged UK authorities to house Christian child with grandparents, non-hardline Muslims.
[00:56:00.135 --> 00:56:03.956]  And the minute I saw this Sunday night, there's been new developments, I knew the scam.
[00:56:03.996 --> 00:56:04.916]  I go, oh, it'll be the mayor,
[00:56:06.374 --> 00:56:11.436]  Just getting money, being a Muslim mayor, and then controlling who gets the kids to get the money.
[00:56:11.976 --> 00:56:14.657]  And guess what's at the end of the article in the Times of London?
[00:56:16.117 --> 00:56:18.398]  The very end of the article, the heart-wrenching article.
[00:56:21.579 --> 00:56:34.224]  They elected the Muslim mayor in 2015, Lutfur Rahman, and now he's been removed after he was found guilty of corruption, bribery, and using undue spiritual influence.
[00:56:35.518 --> 00:56:37.940]  Over voters saying, vote for me or you're going to hell.
[00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:43.944]  And then it gets into how it's a racket to make money taking people's kids.
[00:56:46.106 --> 00:56:51.871]  Parents begged UK authorities to house Christian child with grandparents, not hardline Muslims.
[00:56:53.011 --> 00:56:57.495]  So you've got, she's got brothers and sisters and good people for whatever reason the child was taken.
[00:56:59.176 --> 00:56:59.917]  And grandparents.
[00:57:01.258 --> 00:57:03.359]  But she's got aunts and uncles and grandparents.
[00:57:03.379 --> 00:57:03.419]  No!
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:09.324]  The family's not going to get the money, the taxpayer money to take care of a child.
[00:57:09.604 --> 00:57:09.964]  They are.
[00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:12.006]  And it gets into them taking her cross.
[00:57:12.406 --> 00:57:15.989]  Now when they get her, she just gibbers and cries and says, I'm going to hell because I'm a Christian.
[00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:17.771]  She won't give up her Christian faith.
[00:57:18.091 --> 00:57:18.952]  It's all right here.
[00:57:19.613 --> 00:57:25.478]  And she begs, she begs, I know I love Jesus, but they tell me I'm going to hell if I don't convert to Islam.
[00:57:26.378 --> 00:57:27.079]  It is shus.
[00:57:27.199 --> 00:57:32.504]  And it's photos of them at the park in PR stunts with hoods over their heads.
[00:57:33.837 --> 00:57:38.900]  And the left just makes jokes, they're like, yeah, yeah, take it Christians, take it little girl, take it!
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.723]  Because as long as it's anti-western, anti-white, they love it.
[00:57:43.783 --> 00:57:46.785]  And it's white people like Michael Moore who are behind it.
[00:57:47.246 --> 00:57:50.728]  Michael Moore said, America will be a better country when whites are a minority.
[00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:52.349]  Articles on Infowars.com.
[00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:58.133]  But you can't read these sickening articles with quotes from the social workers.
[00:57:59.363 --> 00:58:00.664]  And of course they quote the UN.
[00:58:01.405 --> 00:58:08.932]  The UN says you should culturally show deference for what you do with children and not put people with cultures that they're not supposed to be with because it's traumatizing.
[00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:11.935]  But you don't understand, she's white and she's Christian!
[00:58:13.775 --> 00:58:29.384]  And they found town councils where 6, 7, 8,000, 2,000, 3,000, this was being reported years ago by Tommy Robinson, where they take the kids and by the time the little girls are 9, they are on the streets as prostitutes run in these Muslim-controlled areas.
[00:58:29.605 --> 00:58:31.586]  And by the way, you can have a town that's 20% Muslim?
[00:58:33.106 --> 00:58:42.296]  The whites are all kind of doing their job, and the Indians, everybody else, but the Muslims, white, black, Arabic, you name it, they take over government because that's their business.
[00:58:42.617 --> 00:58:44.098]  Their business is taking over!
[00:58:44.118 --> 00:58:46.121]  That's why the Middle East is a hellhole!
[00:58:47.342 --> 00:58:49.204]  They don't build stuff, they kill each other!
[00:58:49.825 --> 00:58:53.309]  We brought cancer into our country, and now we feed our children to them!
[00:58:55.185 --> 00:59:00.091]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and BioTrue Selenium, 45% off.
[00:59:00.672 --> 00:59:07.281]  As I've pointed out many times, there's no question that you need to have iodine and selenium in your diet.
[00:59:07.481 --> 00:59:11.947]  The iodine supplementation that we used to have in salt and in wheat has been taken out.
[00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:19.013]  So you need to look at your iodine levels, it supports healthy hormone levels, it supports a healthy metabolism, many other things.
[00:59:19.053 --> 00:59:23.716]  Selenium will support your immune system, your DNA production, your thyroid health, your eyesight.
[00:59:24.077 --> 00:59:26.999]  The only question is, are you going to get a good source of that?
[00:59:27.039 --> 00:59:31.403]  A good, natural, pure, organic source of those supplements?
[00:59:31.643 --> 00:59:33.685]  Are you going to get something that is synthetic?
[00:59:33.745 --> 00:59:35.086]  Something that has fillers in it?
[00:59:35.606 --> 00:59:37.867]  Selenium is 100% organic.
[00:59:37.927 --> 00:59:44.350]  It is made from mustard seeds and the iodine comes from a deep source iodine, our nascent iodine.
[00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:53.354]  Both of these are available right now at 45% off at InfoWarsStore.com and that is for a limited time only and we really do appreciate your support.
[00:59:56.535 --> 01:00:02.458]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.291 --> 01:00:18.493]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:18.954 --> 01:00:20.395]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.038 --> 01:00:27.882]  Well, President Trump arrived about 40 minutes ago in Corpus Christi, Texas.
[01:00:31.937 --> 01:00:35.779]  To survey the worst hurricane to ever hit the state of Texas.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.322]  We've had hurricanes that flooded Galveston and killed more people, sadly.
[01:00:40.683 --> 01:00:44.225]  But in total, trillions of gallons.
[01:00:44.545 --> 01:00:47.907]  They're now saying it's like 18 trillion gallons and the total destruction of property.
[01:00:48.447 --> 01:00:51.509]  And now the panic as people try to get out of Houston.
[01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:54.531]  This is becoming a road warrior scenario.
[01:00:55.272 --> 01:00:59.754]  But the president has done a superlative job of getting out of the way
[01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:14.218]  But the professionals and the citizens of Louisiana, Texas and other states that are coming together and the images of black, white, Hispanic, you name it, all together helping each other.
[01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:21.300]  Black helping white, white helping black, Hispanic helping white, white helping everybody, just humans together, people together.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.900]  It's who we are.
[01:01:23.561 --> 01:01:29.082]  And then you see the evil, evil Democrats claiming that Trump is a divider when he's the opposite.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:38.904]  But when they were trying to use globalism to collapse our country, he had to point out that it's okay to have sovereignty, and it's okay to deport people that come here illegally, just like every other country does.
[01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:47.809]  And that we shouldn't be beaten over the head, and we shouldn't bring in people from unvetted Muslim countries that murder gays and keep women like animals.
[01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:58.935]  Parents begged UK authorities to house Christian child with grandparents, not hardline Muslims, and they said no.
[01:02:00.498 --> 01:02:04.199]  And gave the little five-year-old girl one of thousands per town.
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.861]  Oh yes, thousands per town, depending on the size of the city.
[01:02:08.881 --> 01:02:09.981]  They took her cross away.
[01:02:10.002 --> 01:02:19.145]  Now she gibbers in Arabic saying she doesn't want to basically give up her Christian faith, but she doesn't want to go to hell at the same time.
[01:02:20.216 --> 01:02:30.319]  The parents of the five-year-old Christian girl forced to live in the fundamentalist Muslim family begged the council to allow her to stay with the grandmother as she became increasingly distressed.
[01:02:30.419 --> 01:02:31.439]  This is the social workers.
[01:02:31.939 --> 01:02:33.780]  But the mayor, everyone says, no!
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.861]  That's cash on the borough head right there.
[01:02:37.661 --> 01:02:38.941]  It's now chattel, Demi!
[01:02:40.362 --> 01:02:41.702]  Demi means slave of the Muslim.
[01:02:42.984 --> 01:03:02.580]  The foster family selected by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, removed the child's crucifix necklace, wore full face veils around her, spoke in Arabic which she did not understand, and banned her from consuming bacon, an investigation the Times found.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:09.603]  I love how they put kind of the weak stuff up front because I read six or seven reports on this of what the social workers told local papers.
[01:03:09.883 --> 01:03:20.809]  There's like 20 page articles where it gets into some of it here having to renounce their Christian faith and then crying, begging for mommy, begging for daddy, begging for Mimi.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.281]  Not gonna ever see them again if they have their way.
[01:03:25.282 --> 01:03:34.186]  And if you get found dead, you know, there's the reports where they actually feed people into kebab machines and then feed it to the demis on the street, to the kafirs.
[01:03:34.787 --> 01:03:35.807]  That means the non-Muslims.
[01:03:38.328 --> 01:03:39.469]  I'm not saying this family's doing that.
[01:03:39.509 --> 01:03:39.929]  Oh, never.
[01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:45.272]  Most recently, the council resisted a call to temporarily place her in the care of the grandmother.
[01:03:45.392 --> 01:03:47.253]  No, because the council is run
[01:03:49.619 --> 01:03:51.500]  What's the, what's the Imam of Jerusalem say?
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:52.700]  Europe is weak!
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.220]  Their women are yours!
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.661]  We have bought their leaders!
[01:03:55.921 --> 01:03:56.421]  Go there!
[01:03:56.601 --> 01:03:57.381]  Take their women!
[01:03:57.581 --> 01:03:58.442]  Take their children!
[01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:01.302]  And then we will rise up soon, and kill the males!
[01:04:01.702 --> 01:04:03.143]  Allah has bestowed it!
[01:04:03.163 --> 01:04:04.063]  Europe is weak!
[01:04:04.403 --> 01:04:05.083]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:04:05.103 --> 01:04:07.144]  Want me to play the clip for you?
[01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:17.067]  The child's distress was recorded by the Tower Hamlets employee who supervised regular meetings between the girl and her family.
[01:04:17.347 --> 01:04:22.832]  In a written report on the meeting, the contact supervisor described the girl as very emotional and tearful.
[01:04:23.786 --> 01:04:25.646]  She said they don't speak English at home.
[01:04:25.886 --> 01:04:27.267]  She doesn't understand the Arabic words.
[01:04:27.287 --> 01:04:31.748]  Can you imagine being five years old, thrown in with the people literally wearing Jawa outfits?
[01:04:32.388 --> 01:04:34.608]  She said they don't speak English at home.
[01:04:35.008 --> 01:04:36.568]  She doesn't understand the Arabic words.
[01:04:36.949 --> 01:04:40.689]  Where she is, the girl said, and she wants to go back home to mother.
[01:04:41.609 --> 01:04:43.510]  No, white female!
[01:04:43.930 --> 01:04:44.450]  No!
[01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:47.010]  You're in with the Arab Muslims now!
[01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:48.651]  You're in the harem now!
[01:04:50.171 --> 01:04:51.533]  Oh yeah!
[01:04:51.574 --> 01:04:54.358]  What a cuckle just to rub our little kids in the dirt.
[01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:55.380]  Oh yeah!
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.184]  You'll probably end up on the street by the time you're nine.
[01:04:58.605 --> 01:04:59.586]  Making money!
[01:04:59.606 --> 01:05:02.230]  And then they're going to take over all the city councils!
[01:05:05.256 --> 01:05:10.161]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and BioTrue Selenium, 45% off.
[01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:17.347]  As I've pointed out many times, there's no question that you need to have iodine and selenium in your diet.
[01:05:17.567 --> 01:05:22.012]  The iodine supplementation that we used to have in salt and in wheat has been taken out.

[01:05:34.144 --> 01:05:37.067]  The only question is, are you going to get a good source of that?

[01:05:45.695 --> 01:05:47.956]  Selenium is 100% organic.
[01:05:47.996 --> 01:05:54.419]  It is made from mustard seeds and the iodine comes from a deep source iodine, our nascent iodine.
[01:05:54.479 --> 01:06:03.224]  Both of these are available right now at 45% off at InfoWarsStore.com and that is for a limited time only and we really do appreciate your support.
[01:06:04.292 --> 01:06:11.642]  Of the 30-plus proprietary products that we've developed for InfoWarsLife.com, DNA Force is the flagship.
[01:06:12.022 --> 01:06:20.594]  This highly advanced formula has been sold out for close to six months due to a worldwide shortage of the sought-after ingredients.

[01:08:12.102 --> 01:08:18.986]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:43.542]  Well, the thing I'm best known for, this ties into the hurricane, is gay frogs.
[01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:55.168]  About six, seven years ago, I was reading a scientific report that actually said it made the frogs female, trans, or made male frogs be attracted to male frogs.
[01:08:56.109 --> 01:09:04.373]  And was causing extinction-level events, strangely enough, from Texas to Durban, South Africa, in that particular study.
[01:09:05.936 --> 01:09:07.277]  And here's some headlines today.
[01:09:07.457 --> 01:09:11.321]  Pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females.
[01:09:12.321 --> 01:09:14.263]  That's berkeley.edu.
[01:09:15.604 --> 01:09:16.865]  And the media knows this.
[01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:23.751]  They know it's causing fish to have reproductive problems, humans to have them, and so many of the products we use have it as well.
[01:09:23.831 --> 01:09:26.713]  Pesticide turns male frogs into females.
[01:09:27.814 --> 01:09:32.138]  And technically, they think they're attracted to each other is what happens.
[01:09:32.947 --> 01:09:35.809]  Got a shot of it right here, of the two frogs together.
[01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:38.131]  So, that's what's happening.
[01:09:39.752 --> 01:09:47.418]  And so, then I look at these articles, chemical emergency that's added to areas catastrophe contained.
[01:09:47.438 --> 01:09:49.239]  They've got all these chemicals leaking in Houston.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.301]  They've got all these problems.
[01:09:54.183 --> 01:09:59.107]  And it frustrates me to see the media trying to basically cover up the fact
[01:10:00.014 --> 01:10:08.018]  That the bisphenol A and the atrazine and hundreds and hundreds of other known chemicals are having massive, massive effects on our bodies.
[01:10:08.118 --> 01:10:10.179]  Cancer, you name it.
[01:10:11.059 --> 01:10:20.704]  So with North Korea firing a missile over Japan, the biggest provocation yet yesterday, and with millions of people out of their homes in Houston,
[01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:23.402]  When Trump arriving, he's flying to Austin.
[01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:24.962]  Next we'll have live coverage of that.
[01:10:25.242 --> 01:10:26.363]  There's so much to get into.
[01:10:26.383 --> 01:10:30.004]  We have Sheriff Arpaio who's been pardoned popping in at the bottom of the hour.
[01:10:30.024 --> 01:10:33.005]  We have our reporters who are in Houston coming on.
[01:10:33.025 --> 01:10:34.205]  There's so much happening.
[01:10:35.786 --> 01:10:41.168]  Social justice warriors on major campuses are moving to ban veterans from being able to attend college.
[01:10:41.588 --> 01:10:44.609]  I mean, this is just the societal meltdown.
[01:10:47.551 --> 01:10:55.096]  That is happening in this society and in this culture, but I like to do things where I know I can at least take control of it myself, personally.
[01:10:56.436 --> 01:11:06.482]  And this isn't a pitch for water filtration, but we go out and find the very best gravity-fed water filters, where it takes out all the garbage, but doesn't take out the good minerals, and then I put my drinking water through that.
[01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:11.445]  And if I'm lazy, I've got reverse osmosis, which really cleans the water, but cuts out the minerals.
[01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:15.528]  So over time, it's probably not too good for you to only drink reverse osmosis.
[01:11:15.548 --> 01:11:16.588]  That's in all the studies.
[01:11:17.688 --> 01:11:19.870]  But, I said I'm not plugging.
[01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:22.132]  There are the very best filters you can find out there.
[01:11:23.152 --> 01:11:25.875]  Shower filters, bath filters, that's where you also absorb a lot of it.
[01:11:26.195 --> 01:11:35.562]  But the other big area is the shampoo, and the sunscreens, and the cosmetics, and the body washes, and the soap.
[01:11:36.303 --> 01:11:37.304]  Which isn't really soap.
[01:11:37.944 --> 01:11:38.164]  Soap.
[01:11:39.056 --> 01:11:45.025]  We've spent, and this is a plug, but it's really informational until the bottom of the hour when Sheriff Arpaio joins us.
[01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:53.238]  We spent years saying we want to get an organic, high quality line of toiletries and personal care products
[01:11:54.266 --> 01:11:58.647]  So that I can use them in my own home and know from the manufacturer, it's really what they say.
[01:11:59.468 --> 01:12:10.371]  And folks, we got Mark Gonsalves, the owner of Nature's Brands, one of the biggest organic brands in the country, one of the top sellers at Whole Foods.
[01:12:10.611 --> 01:12:12.811]  Everybody recognizes our labeling because he's so nice.
[01:12:13.151 --> 01:12:17.033]  He even let us use basically his labeling, but changed the name to Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:12:17.073 --> 01:12:21.494]  So whether you get it at Whole Foods under his name or from us, what's best about it is
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.729]  It's on the low end of cost, but better than a lot of the others so-called.
[01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:31.419]  He's got a bunch of organic brands and is so respected, but I wanted to get him on because he's the expert.
[01:12:32.059 --> 01:12:39.102]  He's got a bunch of the brands there of what's in some of the other leading brands and some of the other supposed natural brands that really aren't organic.
[01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:41.423]  But Emmerich Essentials is Nature's Brands.
[01:12:41.463 --> 01:12:46.164]  And you know, the globalists, the media target our sponsors, target our partners.
[01:12:46.485 --> 01:12:50.186]  So Mark Gonzalvez has a lot of courage for Nature's Brands dot com.
[01:12:50.486 --> 01:12:51.527]  Entrepreneur, founder of it.
[01:12:51.547 --> 01:12:55.568]  One of the oldest organic brands out there, 22 plus years.
[01:12:55.888 --> 01:12:56.809]  He's the CEO of it.
[01:12:57.569 --> 01:12:59.891]  He has a lot of courage to come on, because he's not a stupid guy.
[01:12:59.931 --> 01:13:09.957]  He knows the bullies out there are probably attacking, but how could they criticize him for coming on to actually tell people about the chemicals that are in things you use every day?
[01:13:09.997 --> 01:13:12.919]  And why are we so demonized for talking?
[01:13:12.939 --> 01:13:26.768]  Because this is the thing, on the Daily Show and the HBO shows and the news, they're really mad that I'm talking constantly about the chemicals that are in the daily products we use, before I ever came out with Emmerich Essentials, because I have children.
[01:13:27.088 --> 01:13:30.991]  And because I sit here every day reading the news and the studies are legion.
[01:13:31.572 --> 01:13:38.357]  So Mark, thank you so much for coming on to give people this public service information that I think everybody should really appreciate.
[01:13:38.657 --> 01:13:46.103]  But separately, also letting us end up, because we took us years to actually find a top flight company like you that would let us private label.
[01:13:46.123 --> 01:13:46.884]  So thank you so much.
[01:13:47.984 --> 01:13:49.985]  Well, first of all, Alex, it's great to be with you.
[01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:56.587]  And everybody here at Nature's Brands, our hearts and minds are with the folks in Houston, the greater Houston area.
[01:13:56.627 --> 01:13:58.387]  It's incredible what's going on there.
[01:13:58.847 --> 01:14:02.729]  But having said that, we're under a chemical assault.
[01:14:03.129 --> 01:14:06.930]  It's unbelievable to me what we've allowed to take place.
[01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:15.092]  We've got 84,000 chemicals now in play, 13,000 of which are used in our cosmetics and personal care items.
[01:14:15.152 --> 01:14:16.933]  And we use these things every single day.
[01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:20.491]  Yet about 10% have ever been tested.
[01:14:20.931 --> 01:14:28.473]  So we always rely on the chemical company to be able to be considered innocent until we end up proving them guilty.
[01:14:28.533 --> 01:14:29.814]  Does that make any sense at all?
[01:14:30.234 --> 01:14:41.557]  And by the way, the ones that they test, let's face it, all these products, some of which I bought at Walmart, some of which I bought at Whole Foods, and of course, our great pure organic and natural products that we make for you.
[01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:47.359]  Hey, the bottom line is, is the number of chemicals that are in these other products
[01:14:48.075 --> 01:14:50.996]  There's no testing on how these chemicals interact with one another.
[01:14:51.557 --> 01:14:53.037]  It's the same with prescription drugs.
[01:14:53.097 --> 01:14:55.479]  A person takes a prescription drug, yes, there's side effects.
[01:14:55.519 --> 01:14:56.599]  We all understand that.
[01:14:56.919 --> 01:14:59.300]  And some of them include tragic side effects.
[01:14:59.721 --> 01:15:04.003]  But what's never talked about is how the drugs interface with one another.
[01:15:04.423 --> 01:15:06.284]  The average 80-year-old in America, right?
[01:15:06.864 --> 01:15:08.505]  Eight prescription drugs a day.
[01:15:09.306 --> 01:15:10.847]  Yeah, nobody knows how they interface.
[01:15:10.887 --> 01:15:16.969]  And speaking of the water, that's going into the water and hurting the aquatic life and also people downstream to get it in their water table.
[01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.750]  But you were a trailblazer in this.
[01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:24.553]  I mean, 20 plus years ago, when you started Nature's Brands and all these other big brands that are the top of the line.
[01:15:25.573 --> 01:15:29.818]  I mean, this must have been a personal thing for you.
[01:15:30.099 --> 01:15:31.040]  How did you research this?
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.362]  How did you discover this?
[01:15:32.382 --> 01:15:38.329]  Because they now admit that the chemicals that are in a lot of the name brands are carcinogenic.
[01:15:38.389 --> 01:15:40.912]  I mean, they're losing major lawsuits all the time.
[01:15:43.174 --> 01:15:48.220]  First of all, just to put the record straight, I didn't found Nature's Brands, but I am the CEO of Nature's Brands.
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:57.710]  Our founder, who's still involved with us today, he did have a passion 22 years ago to bring clean, organic products, and he knew that they were healthful.
[01:15:57.971 --> 01:15:59.152]  Well, I'm sorry for getting that wrong.
[01:15:59.412 --> 01:16:00.233]  I was just reading about you.
[01:16:00.253 --> 01:16:03.056]  I knew that you were also involved a long time ago in a bunch of development.
[01:16:03.817 --> 01:16:04.418]  For me, my
[01:16:05.265 --> 01:16:09.608]  Journey to this point really has to do with a daughter that was affected by a vaccine.
[01:16:09.628 --> 01:16:13.990]  You know, one day she's a perfectly normal child and the next day she has a huge medical condition.
[01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:15.571]  I'm sure it was a coincidence, by the way.
[01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.679]  I'm sure it was a coincidence 12 years ago.
[01:16:18.319 --> 01:16:19.179]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:16:19.219 --> 01:16:23.201]  Just for most people like yourself, I mean, there's always a story behind why that happened.
[01:16:23.221 --> 01:16:25.382]  And I guess with you, it's, it's, it's, wow.
[01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:26.263]  Right.
[01:16:26.303 --> 01:16:28.404]  And all these jokesters on television, right?
[01:16:28.424 --> 01:16:29.404]  The co-bears of the world.
[01:16:29.424 --> 01:16:30.204]  They think it's funny.
[01:16:30.384 --> 01:16:31.745]  They think it's hilarious.
[01:16:31.785 --> 01:16:34.286]  Until it affects them, it's not going to be so funny, Alex.
[01:16:34.566 --> 01:16:36.187]  It won't be so funny then, will it?
[01:16:36.827 --> 01:16:37.388]  No, it's not.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.281]  And these are things we can control.
[01:16:40.522 --> 01:16:41.482]  I'll tell you an example.
[01:16:41.562 --> 01:16:42.683]  Here's a perfect example.
[01:16:42.903 --> 01:16:45.926]  You have an incredible bug spray that we made.
[01:16:46.106 --> 01:16:47.027]  All organic, right?
[01:16:47.727 --> 01:16:48.248]  Here's one.
[01:16:48.868 --> 01:16:49.569]  Bought it at Walmart.
[01:16:49.609 --> 01:16:50.189]  Look familiar?
[01:16:50.490 --> 01:16:50.670]  Right?
[01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:51.510]  Looks very familiar.
[01:16:52.131 --> 01:16:53.012]  What it says on the back?
[01:16:53.152 --> 01:16:54.273]  Two ingredients are listed.
[01:16:54.373 --> 01:16:56.074]  Deet, 30%.
[01:16:56.535 --> 01:16:58.016]  And then it says other ingredients, 70%.
[01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:02.451]  You don't even know what the other 70% is.
[01:17:02.632 --> 01:17:12.738]  Well, we went online and of course we found out what those other 70% were, including two that are human toxicants that are on there, propane being one of them.
[01:17:12.798 --> 01:17:16.181]  Now you wonder why they say, hey, don't put it next to a flame.
[01:17:16.241 --> 01:17:17.762]  Now you kind of understand that.
[01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:21.044]  So all these things that we put on our body,
[01:17:21.374 --> 01:17:23.456]  They're going into our bloodstream.
[01:17:23.716 --> 01:17:26.938]  Takes about 28 seconds to go into our bloodstream.
[01:17:27.198 --> 01:17:28.299]  So here's what we've got.
[01:17:28.619 --> 01:17:30.701]  We've got the FDA that says, hey, you know what?
[01:17:31.281 --> 01:17:32.763]  For external use only.
[01:17:33.043 --> 01:17:33.683]  Think about this.
[01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:34.344]  Think about this.
[01:17:34.364 --> 01:17:35.825]  They say it's for external use only.
[01:17:35.845 --> 01:17:37.446]  They're not stupid at the FDA.
[01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:39.828]  They know it goes into your bloodstream.
[01:17:41.429 --> 01:17:41.809]  That's right.
[01:17:41.869 --> 01:17:45.572]  Why are so many drugs delivered through the skin?
[01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:48.575]  Because they know that's one of the best ways to put something into the bloodstream.
[01:17:50.579 --> 01:17:54.541]  And unlike food, it's not going through the same process, right?
[01:17:54.561 --> 01:17:56.322]  The metabolic process.
[01:17:57.082 --> 01:18:02.345]  So it just makes me spitting mad when I think about how we're all being played for suckers here.
[01:18:03.706 --> 01:18:09.429]  Now we've got a healthcare system totally corrupted, totally unsustainable.
[01:18:09.449 --> 01:18:15.672]  You know, it wasn't that many years ago, 50 years ago, we spent about 6% on healthcare and about 16% on food.
[01:18:18.385 --> 01:18:19.506]  In America, GDP.
[01:18:20.046 --> 01:18:21.646]  Now, it's completely reversed.
[01:18:22.167 --> 01:18:26.969]  We're paying about 17% now on health care, and it's about 6% on food.
[01:18:27.349 --> 01:18:27.569]  Wow.
[01:18:28.369 --> 01:18:29.290]  That's ridiculous.
[01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:31.171]  I mean, Hippocrates had it best, right?
[01:18:31.431 --> 01:18:35.292]  Let thy food be thy medicine, and thy medicine be thy food.
[01:18:35.312 --> 01:18:39.914]  He didn't reverse that, but yeah, we've forgotten that because of all of the interest.
[01:18:40.154 --> 01:18:46.217]  At the end of the day, Alex, you and I both know, it's always, always, always about the money.
[01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:52.531]  And to sell people out their well-being, their family's well-being, their loved one's well-being.
[01:18:52.771 --> 01:18:55.292]  I don't understand where the end game is in this.
[01:18:55.913 --> 01:18:59.354]  What happens when we have a globe that no longer has people on it?
[01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:00.755]  Is that the end game here?
[01:19:01.755 --> 01:19:04.316]  So it just makes me so fired up.
[01:19:04.636 --> 01:19:04.876]  Wow.
[01:19:05.016 --> 01:19:12.580]  And anybody that looks at these products, all these ones behind me, and can honestly say, that's a smart choice.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.801]  Hey, we've got all sorts of things coming at us.
[01:19:16.795 --> 01:19:19.940]  And of course, all these companies hide behind the plausible deniability.
[01:19:21.182 --> 01:19:29.174]  How do you know my father's dimension now is from the aspartame that he took for 40 years or from something else?
[01:19:29.815 --> 01:19:31.077]  It's plausible deniability.
[01:19:31.137 --> 01:19:31.859]  I'll get away with it.
[01:19:32.298 --> 01:19:36.781]  That's right, because they're hit with so many poisons, but all we know is neurological disorders are exploding.
[01:19:37.201 --> 01:19:39.223]  Girls are now going into puberty on average at 9.
[01:19:39.543 --> 01:19:41.984]  It used to be 14, just 100 years ago.
[01:19:42.665 --> 01:19:45.106]  Some girls are going into puberty at age 3 now.
[01:19:45.487 --> 01:19:50.710]  Boys, though, are arresting puberty, and their testes aren't even falling until later and later.
[01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:52.271]  And then the media makes jokes.
[01:19:52.391 --> 01:19:53.512]  Colbert makes jokes.
[01:19:55.313 --> 01:20:04.142]  Clepper makes jokes when I've got stacks of mainline Journal of Science, you name it, admitting that males are now more female.
[01:20:04.302 --> 01:20:05.723]  Females are hyper female.
[01:20:06.024 --> 01:20:13.151]  That causes different tissues to have cancer earlier, like breast cancer or prostate cancer.
[01:20:13.371 --> 01:20:26.480]  And it's all there, and it's all a big joke to them, and then everybody gets confused sexually because we're being bombarded with all these chemicals, and then they say, oh, don't even talk about the chemicals or you're anti-this or you're anti-that.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:37.527]  When I love everybody, but people need to know we're being chemically experimented on, and more and more, I've got a lot of the documents where they admit they're using this for social engineering.
[01:20:38.373 --> 01:20:39.754]  Well, you know, here's the funny part, Alex.
[01:20:40.194 --> 01:20:42.356]  We have the cruelty free, right?
[01:20:42.376 --> 01:20:45.678]  A leaping bunny on all our products because we don't test on animals.
[01:20:46.819 --> 01:20:47.699]  And people love that.
[01:20:47.839 --> 01:20:50.061]  That's one of the reasons why they come to Nature's Brands.
[01:20:51.101 --> 01:20:56.105]  But yet, these companies think it's perfectly okay to conduct these experiments on mankind.
[01:20:57.381 --> 01:21:00.823]  I mean, why don't we put little stickers on all these packages, right?
[01:21:01.283 --> 01:21:03.324]  Experimenting on mankind.
[01:21:03.404 --> 01:21:04.585]  Mark, I'm impressed.
[01:21:04.605 --> 01:21:10.148]  We hadn't talked yet, but going back over a year ago when we were talking to you, Tim Frugget and others, they said, you got to get this guy on.
[01:21:10.168 --> 01:21:11.088]  This guy's impressive.
[01:21:11.108 --> 01:21:12.829]  You know, he knows all this stuff.
[01:21:13.069 --> 01:21:17.851]  And well, so I just hope, commentary, anytime you've got something to cover, you'll join us.
[01:21:17.891 --> 01:21:20.273]  Now, let's get to the plug, because I never really talk about
[01:21:21.033 --> 01:21:21.633]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:21:21.773 --> 01:21:22.033]  I think so.
[01:21:22.073 --> 01:21:22.474]  I think so.
[01:21:22.514 --> 01:21:22.714]  I think so.
[01:21:22.734 --> 01:21:23.034]  I think so.
[01:21:23.074 --> 01:21:23.354]  I think so.
[01:21:23.374 --> 01:21:23.594]  I think so.
[01:21:23.634 --> 01:21:23.894]  I think so.
[01:21:23.934 --> 01:21:24.354]  I think so.
[01:21:24.374 --> 01:21:24.975]  I think so.
[01:21:24.995 --> 01:21:25.255]  I think so.
[01:21:25.275 --> 01:21:25.515]  I think so.
[01:21:25.535 --> 01:21:25.735]  I think so.
[01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:26.135]  I think so.
[01:21:26.175 --> 01:21:26.555]  I think so.
[01:21:26.575 --> 01:21:26.855]  I think so.
[01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:27.116]  I think so.
[01:21:27.176 --> 01:21:27.476]  I think so.
[01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:28.256]  I think so.
[01:21:28.276 --> 01:21:28.716]  I think so.
[01:21:28.736 --> 01:21:29.517]  I think so.
[01:21:29.577 --> 01:21:30.017]  I think so.
[01:21:30.057 --> 01:21:30.477]  I think so.
[01:21:30.617 --> 01:21:31.077]  I think so.
[01:21:31.097 --> 01:21:31.577]  I think so.
[01:21:31.657 --> 01:21:32.078]  I think so.
[01:21:32.098 --> 01:21:32.458]  I think so.
[01:21:32.498 --> 01:21:32.718]  I think so.
[01:21:32.738 --> 01:21:33.018]  I think so.
[01:21:33.078 --> 01:21:33.498]  I think so.
[01:21:33.518 --> 01:21:33.818]  I think so.
[01:21:33.838 --> 01:21:34.419]  I think so.
[01:21:34.439 --> 01:21:34.659]  I think so.
[01:21:34.679 --> 01:21:34.979]  I think so.
[01:21:34.999 --> 01:21:35.199]  I think so.
[01:21:35.219 --> 01:21:35.439]  I think so.
[01:21:35.459 --> 01:21:35.779]  I think so.
[01:21:35.799 --> 01:21:36.139]  I think so.
[01:21:36.159 --> 01:21:36.720]  I think so.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.200]  I think so.
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:37.520]  I think so.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:37.940]  I think so.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:38.220]  I think so.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:38.560]  I think so.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.141]  I think so.
[01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:39.581]  I think so.
[01:21:39.601 --> 01:21:39.901]  I think so.
[01:21:40.181 --> 01:21:40.381]  I think so.
[01:21:40.401 --> 01:21:40.741]  I think so.
[01:21:40.821 --> 01:21:41.282]  I think so.
[01:21:41.302 --> 01:21:41.722]  I think so.
[01:21:41.742 --> 01:21:42.182]  I think so.
[01:21:42.202 --> 01:21:43.262]  I think so.
[01:21:43.282 --> 01:21:43.522]  I think so.
[01:21:43.562 --> 01:21:43.863]  I think so.
[01:21:43.883 --> 01:21:44.063]  I think
[01:21:49.725 --> 01:21:51.206]  Nature's Brands, go to Whole Foods.
[01:21:51.546 --> 01:21:53.647]  I guess that's Bezos now, but just go wherever you go, get it.
[01:21:53.887 --> 01:21:54.648]  Go to their website, get it.
[01:21:54.668 --> 01:21:59.310]  If you want to support us, get Emmerich's Essentials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:21:59.671 --> 01:22:10.937]  Let's talk about why these are so great for yourself, your children, you name it, and versus the major brands that are out there, some of them that even claim that they're, you know, quote, healthy or they're, quote, natural.
[01:22:12.759 --> 01:22:13.400]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:14.380]  I'll give you an example.
[01:22:14.841 --> 01:22:20.805]  So you have our shampoo and it has very few ingredients.
[01:22:21.485 --> 01:22:23.046]  Here's the tea tree.
[01:22:23.107 --> 01:22:25.148]  Our shampoo that we made for you is tea tree as well.
[01:22:25.168 --> 01:22:25.949]  Very medicinal.
[01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:30.132]  If you have any sort of issues with your scalp, I would highly recommend tea tree.
[01:22:30.452 --> 01:22:32.833]  So here's one from Whole Foods that I bought yesterday.
[01:22:32.854 --> 01:22:35.475]  I don't know if you can see it on the screen.
[01:22:35.716 --> 01:22:37.557]  Those are all the ingredients.
[01:22:38.978 --> 01:22:39.158]  There's 41.
[01:22:39.198 --> 01:22:39.899]  41 ingredients.
[01:22:42.327 --> 01:22:44.688]  Our thing, let me see, I've got the notes right here on it.
[01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:47.609]  Ours has 11.
[01:22:47.649 --> 01:22:48.469]  11 versus 41.
[01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:56.412]  Ours, organic, organic, organic, organic, organic, organic, organic, organic, certified organic, right?
[01:22:56.452 --> 01:22:57.792]  This is sold at Whole Foods.
[01:22:58.152 --> 01:22:58.893]  This is not.
[01:22:59.333 --> 01:23:03.514]  But people walk into Whole Foods and go, oh, well, you know, Whole Foods, they're protecting my interests.
[01:23:03.814 --> 01:23:04.115]  No, no.
[01:23:04.355 --> 01:23:05.275]  Let's get this one right.
[01:23:05.515 --> 01:23:08.096]  They're protecting their own interests.
[01:23:08.912 --> 01:23:10.635]  You have to take responsibility.
[01:23:10.655 --> 01:23:11.937]  You're a person of history, Alex.
[01:23:12.218 --> 01:23:13.700]  You remember Churchill, right?
[01:23:13.761 --> 01:23:19.911]  He's the one, Winston Churchill, who said, the price of greatness is responsibility.
[01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:20.412]  It's true.
[01:23:21.403 --> 01:23:26.946]  Well, I would just simply suggest the price of great health is responsibility.
[01:23:27.346 --> 01:23:31.049]  You can't let these companies play you for suckers, which is what they're doing.
[01:23:31.109 --> 01:23:33.850]  And by the way, I mean, you're a sharp CEO guy.
[01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:34.851]  I've been very successful.
[01:23:34.871 --> 01:23:35.991]  I looked into you months ago.
[01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:38.273]  That's why I was saying you founded a lot of stuff I know.
[01:23:39.153 --> 01:23:44.076]  And, but look how, it wasn't that you were a bad guy, but to get you focused, you had to have your daughter so hurt.
[01:23:44.356 --> 01:23:45.777]  Same thing's happened to people in my family.
[01:23:45.797 --> 01:23:47.538]  I don't want to get into private stuff about Trump.
[01:23:48.038 --> 01:23:49.859]  Trump's big wake-up call was barren.
[01:23:50.279 --> 01:23:52.560]  He was fine, 18 months, third rounds of shots.
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:53.961]  This is a secret, I'm just going to let it out.
[01:23:54.501 --> 01:23:55.962]  And it really messed him up for a while.
[01:23:56.002 --> 01:23:56.683]  He's come back.
[01:23:57.263 --> 01:24:03.126]  But that's, that'll finally, not that Trump was bad, he was a great guy, but he's like, why are they covering this up?
[01:24:03.266 --> 01:24:04.107]  And so,
[01:24:04.787 --> 01:24:11.572]  That's going to be their problem, though, is more and more heavy hitters and smart guys like you and Trump and others physically get hurt.
[01:24:11.992 --> 01:24:16.875]  And that's going to make really serious, smart guys start taking action.
[01:24:17.235 --> 01:24:19.977]  What is the establishment going to do when all this comes out?
[01:24:20.217 --> 01:24:24.440]  It's already come out about bisphenol A and atrazine, and then they're still putting it in stuff.
[01:24:24.921 --> 01:24:25.661]  What's going to happen?
[01:24:25.681 --> 01:24:25.761]  Why?
[01:24:26.442 --> 01:24:27.362]  Why are they doing it?
[01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:32.526]  When I've looked it up, they've got chemicals that are even less expensive that they could be using that have less problems.
[01:24:32.706 --> 01:24:34.307]  It's like they go out of their way to do this.
[01:24:35.588 --> 01:24:36.809]  Here's the curve, Alex, right?
[01:24:37.009 --> 01:24:38.570]  Up and to the right, all this disease.
[01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:40.872]  You talk about it frequently on your show.
[01:24:42.193 --> 01:24:45.696]  It's unbelievable to me that more people are not outraged.
[01:24:45.736 --> 01:24:47.617]  Matter of fact, you know what you and I need to do, Alex?
[01:24:48.158 --> 01:24:51.140]  We have the March Against Monsanto.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:51.820]  Fantastic.
[01:24:51.881 --> 01:24:54.583]  I spoke at it a few years ago, as a matter of fact.
[01:24:54.623 --> 01:24:57.285]  We have also Earth Days, Organic Days.
[01:24:57.845 --> 01:25:00.866]  You and I need to create a chemical-free day.
[01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:08.787]  That's the day that everything that you use, everything you put in your mouth, everything you put on your skin, toxic chemical-free.
[01:25:09.047 --> 01:25:10.007]  And make a joke out of it.
[01:25:10.047 --> 01:25:11.808]  Save the gay frogs, have it be rainbow.
[01:25:11.968 --> 01:25:12.588]  Because that's the thing.
[01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:13.548]  The left is right.
[01:25:13.888 --> 01:25:15.949]  The old-fashioned left about chemicals and things.
[01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:18.169]  They were always the ones that were on target about that.
[01:25:18.449 --> 01:25:22.550]  And now it seems like the left and media have just abandoned it.
[01:25:24.885 --> 01:25:28.868]  I think that companies today, are they purposely trying to kill us?
[01:25:29.248 --> 01:25:34.711]  I don't know if I'm going to go quite that far, but what I will say is, they don't seem to care if they do.
[01:25:36.032 --> 01:25:36.853]  They don't seem to care.
[01:25:36.873 --> 01:25:37.373]  Exactly.
[01:25:37.733 --> 01:25:45.638]  Just like Bayer with the hemophiliac factor 8, they knew it was in there, and they said, you know what, we'll lose money, go ahead and ship these millions of dosages.
[01:25:45.679 --> 01:25:46.219]  They just didn't care.
[01:25:47.379 --> 01:25:47.739]  Exactly.
[01:25:47.759 --> 01:25:51.322]  Hey, as a young person, it was Ford with the Pintel, right?
[01:25:51.903 --> 01:25:54.204]  Oh yeah, well, we have 30 gas tanks that will blow up.
[01:25:54.224 --> 01:26:01.210]  Yeah, we'll get sued for millions and millions of dollars, but hey, at the end of the day, that's a heck of a lot cheaper than having to replace all those gas tanks in a recall.
[01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:03.452]  I mean, golly, we've got a business to protect.
[01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:07.655]  Again, when you place a person's well-being
[01:26:08.684 --> 01:26:16.206]  At the bottom rung of the ladder, and you place purely profit at the top, that is something seriously wrong.
[01:26:16.506 --> 01:26:18.866]  It's just, it goes to my core.
[01:26:19.726 --> 01:26:25.687]  Our daughter's situation, for my wife and I, hey, we were, we walked around with the rose-colored glasses like you can't imagine.
[01:26:25.727 --> 01:26:32.609]  We made every mistake, did everything wrong, thought everybody was fantastic in our government to protect our interests.
[01:26:33.209 --> 01:26:36.130]  And hey, we saw it firsthand.
[01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:38.190]  When you see a child that you love,
[01:26:38.770 --> 01:26:50.279]  And you see them hurting, and you see drugs that are providing tremendous side effects, you watch her change literally in front of your eyes, you start saying, hey, wait a minute, there's got to be a better way.
[01:26:50.299 --> 01:26:54.563]  You're a parent, you'd saw her off your left arm to save your child, wouldn't you?
[01:26:54.623 --> 01:26:56.664]  No problem, you'd do that in an instant.
[01:26:57.725 --> 01:27:00.087]  My mother almost got killed by a flu shot.
[01:27:00.107 --> 01:27:02.649]  My dad's brother almost got killed when he took a tetanus shot.
[01:27:03.069 --> 01:27:07.172]  I mean, and it's on the inserts that can really hurt you, but they tell you, oh, don't look at the inserts.
[01:27:07.452 --> 01:27:08.793]  They don't show those to you when you go to the doctor.
[01:27:08.973 --> 01:27:11.174]  They just say there's no side effects, safe and effective.
[01:27:11.355 --> 01:27:13.716]  And again, same thing with all these other leading brands.
[01:27:13.736 --> 01:27:15.998]  That's why it was such a blessing to
[01:27:17.739 --> 01:27:23.643]  Go to all of these companies and they were either politically correct and want to work with us, or they had stuff in there that our experts said no.
[01:27:24.023 --> 01:27:29.247]  And then when, you know, the scientists and companies I go to talk to, they said, you've got Nature's Brands.
[01:27:29.567 --> 01:27:30.448]  That is amazing.
[01:27:30.488 --> 01:27:31.508]  Naturesbrands.com.
[01:27:32.169 --> 01:27:34.670]  Mark Gonzales, thank you for all the work you're doing.
[01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.852]  I want to get you back up for a full hour.
[01:27:36.912 --> 01:27:38.693]  I'm really impressed with your products.
[01:27:38.713 --> 01:27:43.216]  Again, I was already buying these over the years as I tried to get more health conscious.
[01:27:43.296 --> 01:27:44.217]  I mean, I'm perfect.
[01:27:44.277 --> 01:27:47.519]  I kind of was wearing rose colored glasses when it came to health stuff until about
[01:27:48.079 --> 01:27:54.202]  Seven, eight years ago, myself, I was more like a mainline, you know, libertarian, worried about finances and, you know, military and stuff like that.
[01:27:54.242 --> 01:27:57.243]  But I've got to tell you, we've got six of your great line.
[01:27:58.224 --> 01:28:02.006]  We've got the natural herbal shampoo with a tea tree and so much more.
[01:28:02.326 --> 01:28:04.967]  We've got the 10 to 1 organic mouthwash.
[01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:08.949]  We've got so many of the other great products, the body wash.
[01:28:09.549 --> 01:28:14.391]  We've got the anti-bug spray that's natural and healthy, all at Infowarstore.com.
[01:28:14.611 --> 01:28:15.252]  But you guys,
[01:28:16.192 --> 01:28:18.756]  Have a lot more products than just the six we've put out.
[01:28:18.796 --> 01:28:20.038]  I know we're going to private label more.
[01:28:20.538 --> 01:28:23.362]  Tell folks about some of the other products people can find at naturesbrands.com.
[01:28:24.124 --> 01:28:25.004]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[01:28:25.024 --> 01:28:33.907]  You know, we pioneered organic wellness 22 years ago, as you mentioned earlier, we have 155 certified organic products in our lineup.
[01:28:33.927 --> 01:28:37.028]  That's the largest collection of any company in the world.
[01:28:37.528 --> 01:28:47.131]  And we have literally a couple of hundred other products that are earth mineral based, pure and natural, no petrochemicals, no chemicals that are toxic in any way.
[01:28:47.551 --> 01:28:49.431]  So we're very, very proud of what we pioneered.
[01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.532]  I will tell you this, people are on this chemical
[01:28:52.179 --> 01:28:52.900]  I think so.
[01:29:12.063 --> 01:29:14.365]  Man, we're at 85 and growing.
[01:29:14.385 --> 01:29:16.487]  Well, I don't want to get into personal stuff.
[01:29:16.507 --> 01:29:22.492]  I don't have a lot of skin issues, but as soon as I get older and my hair falls out, I get little zits on top of my head.
[01:29:22.812 --> 01:29:27.817]  And so many other shampoos wouldn't work, literally, using the tea tree before we even private label you.
[01:29:28.297 --> 01:29:30.899]  It got rid of it, and so it's amazing.
[01:29:31.179 --> 01:29:32.140]  Well, we're really impressed.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.361]  Mark, thank you so much.
[01:29:33.421 --> 01:29:34.421]  NaturesBrands.com.
[01:29:34.721 --> 01:29:36.963]  Folks can get their Emmerich Essentials, private labeled by you.
[01:29:37.003 --> 01:29:37.543]  God bless you.
[01:29:37.783 --> 01:29:43.307]  And InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[01:29:43.547 --> 01:29:45.108]  Mark Gonzales, thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:45.989 --> 01:29:46.609]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:47.630]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[01:29:47.890 --> 01:29:48.110]  I will.
[01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:49.972]  Please come back for a full hour as soon as you want to.
[01:29:50.232 --> 01:29:50.472]  Wow!
[01:29:50.872 --> 01:29:51.773]  Sheriff's coming up.
[01:29:52.608 --> 01:29:55.591]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.531 --> 01:29:59.214]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.883 --> 01:30:07.405]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:30:07.865 --> 01:30:13.908]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:30:14.329 --> 01:30:17.110]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:17.490 --> 01:30:20.512]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:20.692 --> 01:30:24.134]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:30:24.474 --> 01:30:26.215]  The left controls culture.
[01:30:26.255 --> 01:30:27.215]  They control arts.
[01:30:27.295 --> 01:30:28.516]  They control entertainment.
[01:30:28.816 --> 01:30:35.899]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.361]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:30:38.841 --> 01:30:42.703]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:30:42.763 --> 01:30:44.824]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[01:30:45.464 --> 01:30:50.829]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[01:30:51.089 --> 01:30:57.335]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:30:57.415 --> 01:30:59.117]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:30:59.257 --> 01:31:00.458]  It's available right now.
[01:31:00.758 --> 01:31:02.940]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:08.905 --> 01:31:15.509]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[01:31:15.529 --> 01:31:18.131]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[01:31:18.291 --> 01:31:21.593]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[01:31:21.753 --> 01:31:23.895]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[01:31:23.935 --> 01:31:28.638]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality known concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[01:31:28.778 --> 01:31:31.540]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:35.862]  It's never been the price it is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[01:31:38.764 --> 01:31:39.585]  Unprecedented.
[01:31:39.665 --> 01:31:40.725]  And it's cold-pressed.
[01:31:40.885 --> 01:31:42.807]  That's why Super Mayo is so different.
[01:31:42.827 --> 01:31:51.171]  People say, well, I know these compounds work, because it's admitted in science, and these are other, what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, there's already best-selling stuff that's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[01:31:51.231 --> 01:31:52.412]  Why, these aren't anything new.
[01:31:52.432 --> 01:31:56.495]  Because, why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[01:31:56.695 --> 01:31:57.135]  Duh.
[01:31:57.155 --> 01:31:57.215]  Duh.
[01:32:03.789 --> 01:32:12.794]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:32:12.874 --> 01:32:20.998]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:32:21.278 --> 01:32:25.982]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:32:26.162 --> 01:32:32.887]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:32.947 --> 01:32:40.033]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:32:40.133 --> 01:32:46.998]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:32:47.158 --> 01:32:51.101]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:51.522]  We're good to go.
[01:33:04.141 --> 01:33:04.701]  We've got it.
[01:33:04.761 --> 01:33:11.185]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:13.386]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:15.668 --> 01:33:21.351]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:25.513 --> 01:33:28.215]  Well, the establishment media's got a big problem.
[01:33:30.211 --> 01:33:34.392]  The Clintons, Obama, they pardoned drug dealers, child molesters, criminals.
[01:33:35.392 --> 01:33:46.895]  Trump pardoned a guy who did his job and followed the Constitution when a judge didn't give him a jury trial and simply politically persecuted him because he was set to win re-election.
[01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:55.917]  And here's President Trump during a press conference getting sniped at yesterday and then we're joined by Sheriff Arpaio exclusively.
[01:33:57.492 --> 01:34:03.199]  In the middle of Hurricane Harvey hitting on Friday night, you chose to pardon former sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[01:34:03.719 --> 01:34:08.825]  I wonder if you could tell us what was behind your thinking for issuing a pardon for the sheriff?
[01:34:09.346 --> 01:34:15.213]  And as well, what do you say to your critics, even some in your own party who say it was the wrong thing to do?
[01:34:16.554 --> 01:34:19.017]  Well, a lot of people think it was the right thing to do, John.
[01:34:19.078 --> 01:34:24.985]  And actually, in the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally.
[01:34:25.065 --> 01:34:26.507]  You know, the hurricane was just starting.
[01:34:27.389 --> 01:34:31.754]  And I put it out that I had pardoned, as we call, as we say, Sheriff Joe.
[01:34:33.095 --> 01:34:35.296]  He's done a great job for the people of Arizona.
[01:34:35.596 --> 01:34:39.857]  He's very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration.
[01:34:40.437 --> 01:34:42.058]  He is loved in Arizona.
[01:34:42.658 --> 01:34:51.260]  I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started, as you know.
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.420]  And he lost in a fairly close election.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.741]  He would have won the election, but they
[01:34:55.581 --> 01:34:57.442]  Just hammered him just before the election.
[01:34:57.482 --> 01:35:00.805]  I thought that was a very, very unfair thing to do.
[01:35:01.785 --> 01:35:04.787]  When I mentioned him the other night, you saw the massive crowd we had.
[01:35:04.847 --> 01:35:09.030]  The people went crazy when I said, what do you think of Sheriff Joe?
[01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:10.151]  Or something to that effect.
[01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:13.373]  The place went absolutely crazy when I was in Arizona last week.
[01:35:14.033 --> 01:35:20.218]  And as far as pardons are concerned, I actually did this just before the meeting because I assumed that somebody would ask me the question.
[01:35:20.258 --> 01:35:21.138]  I didn't know it would be you.
[01:35:21.218 --> 01:35:23.340]  As you can attest, you didn't even know you were going to be called.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:24.901]  I thought I would.
[01:35:25.001 --> 01:35:36.290]  And, you know, Sheriff Joe is a great veteran of the military, great law enforcement person, somebody that's won many, many elections in the state of Arizona.
[01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:40.654]  But I wanted to look at some of the other people that were pardoned over the years.
[01:35:41.475 --> 01:35:45.138]  And if you look at, as an example, President Clinton pardoned Mark Rich.
[01:35:46.493 --> 01:35:56.395]  Who was charged with crimes going back decades, including illegally buying oil from Iran while it held 53 American hostages.
[01:35:56.495 --> 01:35:57.556]  Wasn't allowed to do that.
[01:35:57.676 --> 01:35:59.616]  Selling to the enemies of the United States.
[01:35:59.656 --> 01:36:05.277]  He was pardoned after his wife donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clintons.
[01:36:05.757 --> 01:36:07.998]  Then you have dangerous criminals.
[01:36:08.058 --> 01:36:12.039]  President Clinton pardoned Susan Rosenberg, a member of the weathered
[01:36:13.027 --> 01:36:13.587]  Underground.
[01:36:14.408 --> 01:36:19.692]  Charged as part of a bank robbery that led to a guard and two police officers being killed.
[01:36:20.833 --> 01:36:21.473]  Drug dealers.
[01:36:22.714 --> 01:36:32.281]  President Clinton commuted the sentence of Carlos Vignale, a central player in a cocaine ring that stretched from California to Minnesota.
[01:36:33.682 --> 01:36:34.443]  Criminal leaker.
[01:36:35.764 --> 01:36:36.744]  You've heard the word leaker?
[01:36:38.165 --> 01:36:41.227]  President Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning,
[01:36:42.335 --> 01:36:49.541]  Who leaked countless sensitive and classified documents to WikiLeaks, perhaps, and others.
[01:36:50.482 --> 01:36:52.703]  But horrible, horrible thing that he did.
[01:36:53.364 --> 01:36:54.245]  Commuted the sentence.
[01:36:55.891 --> 01:36:56.872]  And perhaps pardoned.
[01:36:57.553 --> 01:37:13.668]  President Obama commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera, who was charged as part of a violent independence group from Puerto Rico responsible for 28 Chicago area bombings and many deaths in the 1970s and 1980s.
[01:37:17.134 --> 01:37:19.315]  Sheriff Joe is a patriot.
[01:37:19.995 --> 01:37:21.596]  Sheriff Joe loves our country.
[01:37:22.456 --> 01:37:24.397]  Sheriff Joe protected our borders.
[01:37:25.598 --> 01:37:34.241]  And Sheriff Joe was very unfairly treated by the Obama administration, especially right before an election, an election that he would have won.
[01:37:35.662 --> 01:37:36.982]  And he was elected many times.
[01:37:39.059 --> 01:37:46.785]  I stand by my pardon of Sheriff Joe, and I think the people of Arizona, who really know him best, would agree with me.
[01:37:47.005 --> 01:37:47.706]  Thank you very much.
[01:37:48.767 --> 01:37:54.111]  Pardons are supposed to be reserved for people like Arpaio, who've been politically targeted for something that's not illegal.
[01:37:55.152 --> 01:37:57.614]  It's the judge saying, I hold you in contempt, no jury.
[01:37:58.434 --> 01:38:01.517]  That's an imperial judiciary, like they had in Nazi Germany.
[01:38:02.728 --> 01:38:04.509]  And then they just hammered down.
[01:38:04.929 --> 01:38:07.069]  I was talking to a New York Times reporter this morning.
[01:38:07.089 --> 01:38:09.710]  They're like, why are you supporting such a racist?
[01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:12.271]  And I went, for enforcing the laws?
[01:38:12.851 --> 01:38:13.791]  I go to Mexico.
[01:38:15.012 --> 01:38:17.693]  It's six months to a year hard labor if I'm there illegally.
[01:38:18.213 --> 01:38:19.333]  And they torture people.
[01:38:19.953 --> 01:38:20.854]  That's in the London Guardian.
[01:38:20.874 --> 01:38:21.954]  And I'm not defending that.
[01:38:22.454 --> 01:38:28.076]  But 50 miles into Arizona, it said do not go into these areas because the cartels are taking it over.
[01:38:28.456 --> 01:38:29.756]  Mexico's a failed state.
[01:38:29.917 --> 01:38:31.037]  I feel sorry for Mexico.
[01:38:33.595 --> 01:38:41.577]  But it is just crazy all those ranchers and people in Arizona that were Hispanic, by the way, who say, thank God, people like Sheriff Joe, trying to bring some law and order.
[01:38:41.617 --> 01:38:44.578]  Well, he served many terms there.
[01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:47.418]  Before that was with the DEA and the head of the whole Mexico sector.
[01:38:48.299 --> 01:38:54.080]  And he then was politically convicted by the judge, judge jury, and executioner.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:56.621]  And I don't want to take the credit for this.
[01:38:56.641 --> 01:39:00.241]  Dr. Corsi wrote the articles tirelessly, probably 15 of them.
[01:39:03.106 --> 01:39:04.927]  Roger Stone talked to some folks on the telephone.
[01:39:05.087 --> 01:39:05.988]  He gets some credit.
[01:39:06.528 --> 01:39:09.610]  When Roger talked to a certain person on the phone, the person didn't know about it.
[01:39:11.210 --> 01:39:21.016]  And then our articles went up on Drudge and that's when he really read it and looked into it and asked the Justice Department, is this true?
[01:39:21.954 --> 01:39:23.496]  And they're trying to act like that's illegal now.
[01:39:24.036 --> 01:39:26.639]  Notice, weeks ago, I gave him the inside baseball because we're not hiding anything.
[01:39:26.939 --> 01:39:28.440]  I was told about the chain of events.
[01:39:28.941 --> 01:39:31.103]  He just went and said, can a judge just do that?
[01:39:31.123 --> 01:39:32.724]  And they're going, oh, see, that's obstruction.
[01:39:32.745 --> 01:39:33.645]  You talk to the Attorney General.
[01:39:33.906 --> 01:39:35.047]  No, he's the President.
[01:39:36.348 --> 01:39:37.429]  The Unitary Executive.
[01:39:37.829 --> 01:39:38.991]  He can do the pardon.
[01:39:40.376 --> 01:39:49.001]  Obama pardoned cocaine dealers and weather underground bombers that blew bank tellers up to death, and police officers.
[01:39:49.021 --> 01:39:51.462]  So let's go to Sheriff Jones instead of me ranting.
[01:39:52.142 --> 01:39:56.264]  It's just so frustrating to watch them take everything Trump does.
[01:39:56.304 --> 01:40:02.027]  And now Mueller, we have a Maxine Waters clip coming up, said, oh, we've got our man Mueller.
[01:40:02.328 --> 01:40:04.729]  She's admitting he's a Democratic operative.
[01:40:06.457 --> 01:40:12.027]  Going after the president, they've got the District of Columbia swamped with some hand-picked grand jury.
[01:40:12.047 --> 01:40:14.933]  They've got grand juries reportedly...
[01:40:15.987 --> 01:40:19.329]  Looking into it, I'm a Russian agent, I don't have zero Russian connections.
[01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:20.750]  This is a joke, folks.
[01:40:21.091 --> 01:40:26.214]  And they want to try to come after popular people that are pro-America and shut us down as intimidation.
[01:40:26.474 --> 01:40:36.862]  So we've got a lot to talk about in the next 20 minutes to the end of the hour with former Sheriff of Maricopa County and now a free man, now not facing the six months in jail, no jury.
[01:40:37.262 --> 01:40:39.684]  But now the President is under fire.
[01:40:39.744 --> 01:40:40.765]  Sheriff Joe, what do you say?
[01:40:42.646 --> 01:40:45.448]  Excuse me, I feel sorry, Alex, for him.
[01:40:46.498 --> 01:40:49.965]  Look what they did to me and they can do it to the president too.
[01:40:50.045 --> 01:40:54.114]  So I'm very concerned about what's going on in Washington.
[01:40:56.307 --> 01:41:08.458]  The Obama administration, as you probably know, and Holder, 60 days after they took office, they went after me.
[01:41:08.819 --> 01:41:13.022]  It wasn't under Bush, like all the media and critics are saying.
[01:41:13.083 --> 01:41:16.406]  I got the report that shows it happened in January.
[01:41:17.406 --> 01:41:22.611]  That's right, and I forgot, you said that once you were pardoned you could come on and tell us the rest of the story.
[01:41:22.831 --> 01:41:24.993]  What is the rest of the story that you can now tell folks?
[01:41:26.555 --> 01:41:36.044]  Well, there's some things I'm gonna leave out because it has to do with the bias of the first judge.
[01:41:37.205 --> 01:41:39.247]  I'm not gonna get into where his brother
[01:41:40.057 --> 01:41:48.943]  Well, brother-in-law work a law firm that is against me and supporting the ACLU against the same judge.
[01:41:49.564 --> 01:41:52.966]  I can go on and on the bias in that civil case.
[01:41:54.047 --> 01:41:56.829]  And then he said during the trial, he wants skin in the game.
[01:41:56.849 --> 01:42:05.055]  So I knew he was a dump a charge over to the criminal court, which another judge took up.
[01:42:05.115 --> 01:42:08.898]  We had a trial just recently.
[01:42:09.944 --> 01:42:15.046]  The Department of Justice Integrity Unit was running it.
[01:42:16.667 --> 01:42:19.088]  And during that trial, there was no evidence.
[01:42:19.689 --> 01:42:23.791]  Even the prosecutor said there was no racial profiling.
[01:42:24.711 --> 01:42:30.254]  And yet the judge ruled against me, no jury, wrong charge.
[01:42:31.554 --> 01:42:37.297]  And when she hit me guilty, I had to hear it from the media.
[01:42:37.877 --> 01:42:39.118]  Didn't even call me to court.
[01:42:39.850 --> 01:42:43.672]  To stand before her, that's another violation of my coverage.
[01:42:43.692 --> 01:42:47.293]  That's why you're supposed to be able to be there to respond and make a statement and talk to the media.
[01:42:47.573 --> 01:42:48.994]  Instead, they just did it in the dark.
[01:42:50.254 --> 01:42:51.755]  Yeah, I heard it from the media.
[01:42:52.415 --> 01:42:53.516]  I can go on and on.
[01:42:54.776 --> 01:42:56.257]  But I'm going to fight this.
[01:42:57.297 --> 01:42:59.558]  Even my wife says, why don't you calm down?
[01:42:59.618 --> 01:42:59.778]  No.
[01:42:59.798 --> 01:43:01.219]  You know, I'm a fighter.
[01:43:01.239 --> 01:43:06.441]  55 years in law enforcement around the world as a top federal law enforcement official.
[01:43:07.475 --> 01:43:10.777]  And then I end up with two parking tickets in my life.
[01:43:11.677 --> 01:43:20.721]  End up sitting at a defense table before a judge accused of a crime, which by the way is a misdemeanor.
[01:43:21.483 --> 01:43:25.425]  If you have barking dogs, you can get the same time that I could get.
[01:43:25.745 --> 01:43:31.547]  Sure, what do you make of the media when they say, you admit you racially profiled, and then I look, you never said that.
[01:43:32.668 --> 01:43:33.528]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:43:33.548 --> 01:43:37.790]  And now we have 800 cities where people can drunk drive, they can do it from anywhere in the world.
[01:43:37.890 --> 01:43:41.431]  China, Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America.
[01:43:41.752 --> 01:43:48.595]  I mean, you have serial killers that have killed 20 something people, you know, deported 20 plus times, deported 40 times.
[01:43:48.935 --> 01:43:49.615]  I mean, it is like a
[01:43:50.455 --> 01:44:05.539]  Yeah, Scalia, the Supreme Court, said way back that law enforcement can stop people and hold them and turn them over to the Border Patrol or ICE.
[01:44:07.199 --> 01:44:14.241]  The judge that wrote against me, she turned down parts of the 1070, that's that famous law that
[01:44:15.456 --> 01:44:20.600]  was started where law enforcement can enforce the illegal immigration laws.
[01:44:21.481 --> 01:44:27.426]  And I was, I would say about 150 of my officers were trained by ICE.
[01:44:28.166 --> 01:44:29.407]  I signed contracts.
[01:44:30.088 --> 01:44:35.012]  This is 2007, you know, 27, I think it was 2009, that I had the authority to act as illegal immigration officer.
[01:44:42.488 --> 01:44:44.792]  And they finally took that away from me.
[01:44:44.852 --> 01:44:46.556]  We were doing too good of a job.
[01:44:47.077 --> 01:44:48.038]  And this is Holder.
[01:44:49.295 --> 01:44:50.015]  And Obama.
[01:44:50.756 --> 01:44:53.477]  By the way, the Democrats removed him from office.
[01:44:53.737 --> 01:44:56.139]  Our last sheriff was an African-American sheriff, a Democrat.
[01:44:56.499 --> 01:45:01.842]  But he said, listen, we've got to have deportations of murderers and arsonists and rapists.
[01:45:02.142 --> 01:45:08.626]  So he was handing over to ICE three people a week on average, letting everybody else go, DWIs, you name it.
[01:45:08.886 --> 01:45:10.847]  But he was holding rapists and murderers.
[01:45:11.167 --> 01:45:14.729]  The Democrats called him a racist and kicked him out of office.
[01:45:15.169 --> 01:45:18.070]  Ran somebody else against him in Travis County where I live.
[01:45:18.330 --> 01:45:19.310]  Is that not insane?
[01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:40.175]  Well you know Soros pumped in George Soros four million dollars to get me defeated and also the Department of Justice of course the day before early voting said that they're going to charge me with this misdemeanor
[01:45:41.559 --> 01:45:47.506]  Day before early voting, and I could get six months in jail, two weeks later, they charged me.
[01:45:47.526 --> 01:45:50.570]  And that was two weeks before people went to the poll.
[01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:52.132]  So they hit me twice.
[01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:57.294]  Politically, and as a Department of Justice policy, you don't do this.
[01:45:57.794 --> 01:46:00.957]  Actually, you don't really doing it when people are voting.
[01:46:01.418 --> 01:46:07.203]  I guess you can wait a while so you can see and you can see I'm a little angry.
[01:46:07.683 --> 01:46:08.364]  Well, you should be.
[01:46:08.384 --> 01:46:12.848]  So let's so let's say because a lot of folks are watching want to hear from you.
[01:46:13.268 --> 01:46:15.010]  Say the things you think need to be heard.
[01:46:15.690 --> 01:46:18.533]  They're talking about going at the president for pardoning you.
[01:46:18.893 --> 01:46:19.073]  I mean,
[01:46:20.294 --> 01:46:22.856]  Speaking of the clip we played earlier, can you elaborate?
[01:46:22.896 --> 01:46:35.184]  I mean, child molesters, bank robbers, people that are bombing police, people that are cocaine dealers are being pardoned by Obama and by the Clintons, but you're bad.
[01:46:36.224 --> 01:46:36.885]  Trump's bad.
[01:46:36.945 --> 01:46:37.985]  You shouldn't have been pardoned.
[01:46:39.686 --> 01:46:40.807]  Well, of course.
[01:46:41.107 --> 01:46:44.990]  The activists, some politicians like McCain and Flake,
[01:46:45.715 --> 01:46:54.725]  I'm really disappointed in them where they said I should not have been pardoned and Flake took, McCain took some shots, which I'm surprised.
[01:46:55.406 --> 01:46:59.010]  I stayed out of his race as a matter of courtesy last time.
[01:46:59.590 --> 01:47:00.892]  So, you know, they hate Trump.
[01:47:01.713 --> 01:47:02.553]  They're using me.
[01:47:02.634 --> 01:47:03.555]  I hate to say this.
[01:47:03.575 --> 01:47:06.678]  They're using me to get to our great president.
[01:47:06.718 --> 01:47:07.179]  You know that.
[01:47:08.027 --> 01:47:17.196]  When they say to Republicans that Ryan and the Republican Party is against our president for, you know, the pardon.
[01:47:17.456 --> 01:47:17.916]  What do you mean?
[01:47:18.156 --> 01:47:19.718]  A handful of Republicans?
[01:47:19.738 --> 01:47:22.661]  Does that mean all the Republican legislators?
[01:47:23.061 --> 01:47:27.385]  I've had three Republican congressmen support me on this issue.
[01:47:27.465 --> 01:47:28.506]  Oh, and that's the next point.
[01:47:28.586 --> 01:47:30.408]  Word is you might be running for Senate.
[01:47:32.645 --> 01:47:46.754]  Well, I've been talking to a lot of people, but yesterday someone called me from Washington, and it's an examiner, wanted to know my future, and I just said, hey.
[01:47:47.314 --> 01:47:50.936]  You know, I told my wife after I left office, I'm done with politics.
[01:47:51.496 --> 01:47:52.017]  Forget it.
[01:47:52.417 --> 01:47:56.840]  And then I re-evaluated what's going on in our country, so I'm back in action.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.981]  I'm going to support the good Republicans.
[01:48:02.221 --> 01:48:07.986]  I hate to brag, but how come every time presidents run, they all come to me for my endorsement?
[01:48:08.746 --> 01:48:11.489]  So I re-evaluated it.
[01:48:11.529 --> 01:48:13.030]  Well, are you going to run for office?
[01:48:13.450 --> 01:48:15.452]  I said, I don't know if I'm going to run for office.
[01:48:15.732 --> 01:48:16.653]  I haven't decided.
[01:48:17.133 --> 01:48:18.034]  Or which office?
[01:48:18.114 --> 01:48:19.115]  And I mentioned Flake.
[01:48:19.725 --> 01:48:23.848]  I said, I still don't know if I'm going to run for office, and I left it at that.
[01:48:24.208 --> 01:48:25.288]  Well, Flake's a Flake.
[01:48:25.428 --> 01:48:28.911]  I mean, Flake is a lily-livered, globalist establishment guy.
[01:48:29.171 --> 01:48:35.855]  They're the same people like Paul Ryan that gave us Obamacare, and they blame Trump when he can't get rid of it, when they're the ones standing in the way.
[01:48:36.055 --> 01:48:37.235]  So we need you in the Senate.
[01:48:37.496 --> 01:48:39.657]  We need Flake to be removed.
[01:48:39.897 --> 01:48:41.238]  We need McCain to be gone.
[01:48:41.278 --> 01:48:43.379]  We need real patriots that have courage.
[01:48:43.399 --> 01:48:44.480]  And what does it say about Trump?
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:48.142]  That he didn't just forget about you, you know, after you supported him.
[01:48:48.422 --> 01:48:50.965]  You know, he went against the political correctness and did the right thing.
[01:48:51.225 --> 01:48:52.887]  That's why we love Trump so much.
[01:48:54.328 --> 01:48:56.310]  Yeah, I love the guy from day one.
[01:48:56.390 --> 01:49:04.579]  I supported him and I've been saying throughout, even if he did not get me to pardon, I still will be for him to the end.
[01:49:04.759 --> 01:49:05.419]  I say that.
[01:49:05.439 --> 01:49:10.304]  I don't know how many other politicians have the guts to say that, which is sad.
[01:49:11.005 --> 01:49:12.286]  They always skirt around.
[01:49:12.306 --> 01:49:15.927]  Well that's why they keep attacking and pushing all this is that they're gonna break our will.
[01:49:16.247 --> 01:49:21.629]  Lou Dobbs made that point with the Black Lives Matter and the Antifa beating people up and nothing being done.
[01:49:21.989 --> 01:49:23.790]  What do you think the liberals are trying to do right now?
[01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:28.512]  Because they are just running around beating up prayer meetings, screaming everyone's a Nazi.
[01:49:29.112 --> 01:49:29.672]  What's happened?
[01:49:30.852 --> 01:49:32.693]  They can't get over the defeat.
[01:49:33.994 --> 01:49:34.914]  That's number one.
[01:49:34.934 --> 01:49:40.096]  Number two, they don't like a president that speaks out and does the right thing.
[01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:41.615]  They don't like that.
[01:49:42.155 --> 01:49:43.336]  They want to get rid of him.
[01:49:43.436 --> 01:49:46.318]  This is all about getting rid of our president.
[01:49:47.799 --> 01:49:50.341]  That's what the whole situation is about.
[01:49:50.521 --> 01:49:52.742]  Well, Sheriff Arpaio, you're absolutely right.
[01:49:53.163 --> 01:49:56.865]  Flake, as you know, is 20-plus points behind a year out from the election.
[01:49:57.125 --> 01:50:00.287]  With your name recognition, you have got to run for the Senate.
[01:50:00.307 --> 01:50:03.810]  This guy is low-hanging fruit, and imagine having you in the U.S.
[01:50:03.850 --> 01:50:04.150]  Senate.
[01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:06.091]  That would be a delicious revenge.
[01:50:08.733 --> 01:50:09.754]  Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[01:50:10.555 --> 01:50:15.200]  I'll be helping the president, no doubt about that.
[01:50:15.261 --> 01:50:20.767]  He has one vote, if I'm there, and I know how to rock the boat.
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:23.302]  Being controversial, you know that.
[01:50:23.322 --> 01:50:27.766]  The past 24 years, all over the world, people know who I am.
[01:50:27.866 --> 01:50:29.728]  Senator Joe Arpaio, U.S.
[01:50:29.768 --> 01:50:33.051]  Senator Joe Arpaio, is our guest.
[01:50:33.071 --> 01:50:34.712]  We've got one more short segment, one to break.
[01:50:34.732 --> 01:50:35.853]  He'll be gone at the end of the hour.
[01:50:36.093 --> 01:50:41.258]  This is a big exclusive, giving us an exclusive interview after the pardon came through.
[01:50:41.778 --> 01:50:47.283]  And boy, they are demonizing him 24-7, but it's good company to be in, because if he's a bad guy,
[01:50:48.144 --> 01:50:56.255]  Every county sheriff in Canada and everybody in every Mexican state in Mexico is an evil racist too because they've got stronger laws than we do.
[01:50:57.056 --> 01:50:59.860]  And now Canada is really cracking down as they get a flood of refugees.
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:01.623]  Final segment with our guest, straight ahead.
[01:51:05.837 --> 01:51:06.158]  It is.
[01:51:06.258 --> 01:51:07.219]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:07.239 --> 01:51:14.106]  We're here with Tommy Robinson, author of Enemy of the State, but he also has a new book out, which I think came out today.
[01:51:14.146 --> 01:51:16.989]  It's already skyrocketing up the charts on Amazon.
[01:51:17.169 --> 01:51:18.130]  Tommy, welcome back.
[01:51:18.251 --> 01:51:18.711]  Hello, Paul.
[01:51:18.751 --> 01:51:19.392]  Thanks for having me.
[01:51:19.452 --> 01:51:20.133]  Good to have you back.
[01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:27.821]  Now, before this unfortunate attack in Hamburg, Germany today, which we don't know the full details of, but it seems to be another Islamic terror attack,
[01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:30.542]  There was this kind of lull, at least in Europe.
[01:51:30.622 --> 01:51:35.803]  The terror attacks seemed to stop all of a sudden, at least for a period of three or four weeks.
[01:51:35.883 --> 01:51:39.564]  The terror attacks appeared to stop when Ramadan ended.
[01:51:39.704 --> 01:51:46.666]  Now, Tommy, surely there's no connection, given we know Islam is a religion of peace and that it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:54.228]  So why did the terror attacks in Europe suddenly seem to stop when Ramadan ended, given that there's no connection?
[01:51:56.152 --> 01:51:57.193]  We see this every year.
[01:51:57.373 --> 01:51:58.475]  We see what's it called?
[01:51:58.495 --> 01:52:00.176]  The Ramadan Bombathon.
[01:52:02.098 --> 01:52:05.362]  Which you see the figures coming through daily and they excel.
[01:52:05.682 --> 01:52:13.090]  We see most attacks as instructed during the holy or unholy or very violent month of Ramadan.
[01:52:13.710 --> 01:52:24.759]  Another thing that they seem not so keen to be reporting on, Tommy, is we had a mob rampage in Liverpool recently, which was, you know, as plain a hate crime as you will ever see.
[01:52:25.159 --> 01:52:27.101]  Numerous people attacked in the street.
[01:52:27.781 --> 01:52:34.527]  We're all supposed to be really concerned about hate crimes in the aftermath of Brexit and in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.
[01:52:35.111 --> 01:52:37.614]  But Tommy, why is the BBC not reporting on this?
[01:52:37.914 --> 01:52:45.102]  What is it about this hate crime that seems to have prompted the left and so much of the mainstream media to ignore it?
[01:52:46.428 --> 01:52:48.530]  And let's have the details as well of this crime.
[01:52:48.610 --> 01:52:52.333]  The details are, young Muslim men, they stopped a Muslim man.
[01:52:52.373 --> 01:52:53.453]  They said to him, what religion are you?
[01:52:53.694 --> 01:52:54.474]  And he said, Muslim.
[01:52:54.754 --> 01:52:55.975]  They said, say the Muslim words.
[01:52:56.596 --> 01:52:58.597]  And he said, there is no prophet but Muhammad.
[01:52:58.617 --> 01:53:00.138]  He said, and they left him.
[01:53:00.419 --> 01:53:01.099]  They walked on.
[01:53:01.319 --> 01:53:02.240]  They stopped the next man.
[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:03.361]  What religion are you?
[01:53:03.601 --> 01:53:04.242]  I'm Christian.
[01:53:04.442 --> 01:53:04.762]  Bang.
[01:53:05.122 --> 01:53:06.043]  They violently beat him.
[01:53:06.063 --> 01:53:07.304]  His girlfriend tried to stop them.
[01:53:07.524 --> 01:53:09.906]  These weren't just hate crimes where there's a group attacking a man.
[01:53:10.186 --> 01:53:12.608]  They're attacking men who are with their partners, with their girlfriends.
[01:53:12.968 --> 01:53:28.536]  If the roles were reversed, if this was a bunch of white people, a bunch of far-right Christians or whoever, rampaging through the streets asking Muslims if they were Christian, if they said they were Muslims, attacking them viciously, that would be a national outrage as it is.
[01:53:28.876 --> 01:53:35.420]  The BBC hasn't even reported it in their local section and these guys tell me they're gonna be in jail.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:37.001]  They've got sentences for about 42 weeks.
[01:53:38.141 --> 01:53:43.983]  They're probably going to be out on the streets again within months, and no one will even have heard of this because they're not reporting on it.
[01:53:44.023 --> 01:53:53.645]  Can anyone imagine the outcry if Muslim families, because this is what it is, families, men and women, were stopped walking home and asked, are you Muslim?
[01:53:53.886 --> 01:53:56.106]  And when they say yes, they're all violently beaten.
[01:53:56.126 --> 01:53:56.686]  Could you imagine?
[01:53:57.327 --> 01:54:02.228]  Imagine that it would be, it wouldn't just be national outrage, it would be international, it would be worldwide.
[01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:14.153]  Alright, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, former sheriff, former DEA head guy.
[01:54:14.173 --> 01:54:15.934]  I think he's going to run for Senate.
[01:54:15.994 --> 01:54:19.637]  Rising out of the political ashes of Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:54:19.697 --> 01:54:20.277]  The Phoenix.
[01:54:34.674 --> 01:54:37.495]  Flake is 20 plus points behind in major polls.
[01:54:37.876 --> 01:54:38.656]  It's getting worse.
[01:54:38.696 --> 01:54:41.217]  He is a sycophant of the establishment.
[01:54:41.257 --> 01:54:45.239]  I mean, he looks totally disingenuous and his voting record is worse.
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:46.400]  I'm excited.
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:49.542]  But in closing, Sheriff Joe, thanks for the big exclusive interview.
[01:54:49.562 --> 01:54:52.263]  You want to repeat some of the powerful stuff you were telling me during the break?
[01:54:54.264 --> 01:54:58.706]  Well, you know, I've always dealt with the media my 55 years.
[01:55:00.956 --> 01:55:07.079]  I have relatives that work for the media, but it's really a shame what they're doing to the president.
[01:55:07.139 --> 01:55:15.822]  Forget me, I'm a good target, but what they are doing to our president lies, deceit, everything to get rid of him.
[01:55:16.142 --> 01:55:16.782]  Everything.
[01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:20.884]  But I'll tell you one thing, I said that when I introduced him two years ago.
[01:55:21.284 --> 01:55:25.366]  I got a standing ovation when I said there's a silent majority.
[01:55:25.906 --> 01:55:30.227]  Well, there's a silent majority out there, but there's a vocal majority now, too.
[01:55:30.768 --> 01:55:37.650]  So if they think they're going to take this president down with all their garbage and lies and crap, I got news for them.
[01:55:38.350 --> 01:55:41.091]  He'll be one of the greatest presidents we ever had.
[01:55:41.111 --> 01:55:42.751]  And I said that a few months ago.
[01:55:42.771 --> 01:55:44.632]  And I'll say it again.
[01:55:46.685 --> 01:55:52.869]  As you look into history, he will go down as one of the greatest presidents this country has ever seen.
[01:55:53.469 --> 01:55:57.192]  And I predicted he would be elected when I first introduced him.
[01:55:57.592 --> 01:56:01.895]  He was running against 17 people, and I said he will be the next president.
[01:56:02.175 --> 01:56:03.456]  So maybe I'm psychic.
[01:56:03.536 --> 01:56:05.017]  I ought to go into that business.
[01:56:05.957 --> 01:56:08.299]  But that's what I predict, Alex.
[01:56:08.839 --> 01:56:09.660]  He needs help.
[01:56:11.021 --> 01:56:14.083]  I don't like people going after his family.
[01:56:14.978 --> 01:56:27.167]  And all this Russia garbage and calling them a racist, calling me a racist, saying I was charged with racial profile, which is a lie.
[01:56:27.907 --> 01:56:29.549]  So these people better watch out.
[01:56:30.189 --> 01:56:33.832]  They better be careful, all these elected officials that want to take me down.
[01:56:34.991 --> 01:56:36.252]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:56:36.272 --> 01:56:43.796]  I was told the president really liked Roger Stone's clip on TMZ when they confronted him in an LA airport saying, we're going to impeach Trump.
[01:56:44.736 --> 01:56:50.279]  And he said, well, you better watch out because I'm not calling for violence, but the left wants a violent revolution.
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.641]  They got CIA guys on TV saying they're going to kill him on CNN.
[01:56:54.302 --> 01:56:56.723]  Stone said, you better watch out because there's going to be a revolution.
[01:56:57.003 --> 01:56:58.124]  I think they pushed too far.
[01:57:00.143 --> 01:57:01.345]  Yes, I think they did.
[01:57:01.365 --> 01:57:03.028]  It's all a conspiracy.
[01:57:03.048 --> 01:57:04.310]  I hate to use that word.
[01:57:05.332 --> 01:57:11.864]  In law enforcement, I've always solved cases because I was very active in conspiracies.
[01:57:12.982 --> 01:57:19.485]  Uh, another issue that cropped up, uh, calling me a nutcase or something because of a certain birth certificate.
[01:57:19.725 --> 01:57:21.246]  They got that all wrong, too.
[01:57:21.867 --> 01:57:22.867]  It was debunked.
[01:57:23.307 --> 01:57:24.328]  Who debunked it?
[01:57:24.808 --> 01:57:26.649]  Nobody ever would do anything with it.
[01:57:27.169 --> 01:57:28.450]  So that was debunked.
[01:57:29.050 --> 01:57:30.771]  The, uh, documents were fake.
[01:57:30.791 --> 01:57:32.272]  Of course they lie.
[01:57:32.812 --> 01:57:33.252]  They lie.
[01:57:33.272 --> 01:57:34.253]  The media lies.
[01:57:34.373 --> 01:57:35.613]  Politicians lie.
[01:57:35.994 --> 01:57:36.574]  They don't care.
[01:57:37.848 --> 01:57:39.431]  All they care is about themselves.
[01:57:39.832 --> 01:57:42.437]  They get re-elected and when they see...
[01:57:43.829 --> 01:57:44.269]  Blood.
[01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:47.912]  They really go after you when you think there's blood out there.
[01:57:48.112 --> 01:57:51.054]  Well, I think it's more than blood in the water, Sheriff Joe.
[01:57:51.474 --> 01:57:52.015]  I think you're right.
[01:57:52.035 --> 01:57:52.495]  It's part of it.
[01:57:52.915 --> 01:57:53.976]  They're in their death throes.
[01:57:54.316 --> 01:57:59.720]  The Democrats are becoming a coastal party, a party of socialist views.
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.301]  All the demographics show it.
[01:58:01.581 --> 01:58:03.282]  They tried to create everything and make it all racial.
[01:58:03.342 --> 01:58:04.103]  It backfired.
[01:58:04.463 --> 01:58:06.484]  And it shows demographically people want free market.
[01:58:06.504 --> 01:58:07.265]  They want America.
[01:58:07.605 --> 01:58:09.126]  And people are rejecting the Democrats.
[01:58:10.607 --> 01:58:11.247]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:58:11.287 --> 01:58:13.429]  Look what the president has done in seven months.
[01:58:14.386 --> 01:58:15.608]  He works all the time.
[01:58:16.028 --> 01:58:16.870]  Always working.
[01:58:17.591 --> 01:58:19.514]  What president works like he works?
[01:58:20.495 --> 01:58:21.838]  And he never rests.
[01:58:22.038 --> 01:58:22.939]  He's always there.
[01:58:23.741 --> 01:58:24.802]  Trying to do the job.
[01:58:24.862 --> 01:58:26.245]  Traveling all over the world.
[01:58:26.983 --> 01:58:32.324]  What a great, he's the best Secretary of State we've had in years and years, believe me.
[01:58:32.864 --> 01:58:35.965]  He knows how to operate, how to make deals, go behind the scenes.
[01:58:36.025 --> 01:58:39.306]  His own mission is to get the job done.
[01:58:39.326 --> 01:58:41.106]  Sheriff, this is only a one minute break.
[01:58:41.126 --> 01:58:42.246]  Stay there, I've got one more question.
[01:58:42.266 --> 01:58:43.346]  We'll be gone in like three, four minutes.
[01:58:43.646 --> 01:58:46.027]  I'm going to come back and ask you a question on that issue.
[01:58:46.047 --> 01:58:48.367]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, stay with us.
[01:58:48.387 --> 01:58:50.468]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:59:55.771 --> 01:59:59.865]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:00:00.387 --> 02:00:01.672]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:17.765 --> 02:00:21.868]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:22.708 --> 02:00:24.129]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:29.933]  The illegals are used by the cartels, the puppets, the big banks as pawns.
[02:00:32.635 --> 02:00:34.977]  But the globalists want to get rid of our borders and our sovereignty.
[02:00:34.997 --> 02:00:43.763]  They want world government and it's that idea that Sheriff Joe Arpaio has been challenging and that President Trump's been challenging and I was
[02:00:44.804 --> 02:01:05.530]  I was talking to Sheriff Joe during the break and I was saying, how do we get these other cowards that surround Trump to stop caring what the mainstream media says and realize the mainstream media is hated by a majority of the American people, they have a 7% approval rating, and that's the secret Joe knows, I know, the President knows, and he went on to say, yeah, I'm more popular than I've ever been, it's incredible!
[02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:12.552]  And that's it, people want trailblazers, they want mavericks, they want people that do what they say they're going to do, like the President,
[02:01:13.675 --> 02:01:16.818]  Sticking with the sheriff after he pardoned him.
[02:01:17.018 --> 02:01:18.940]  They don't want him using his executive power.
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:20.761]  They say everything he does is wrong.
[02:01:21.021 --> 02:01:34.213]  As the economy turns back on, as the border is 69% more secure than it was, as NAFTA and GATT are being renegotiated, as the carbon tax got killed, as the VA's got 40-some percent more
[02:01:35.199 --> 02:01:37.405]  People being served than just seven months ago.
[02:01:37.706 --> 02:01:40.032]  I mean, this guy is totally delivering.
[02:01:40.072 --> 02:01:41.115]  How do we support him?
[02:01:42.378 --> 02:01:43.641]  Where do you see this country going?
[02:01:44.983 --> 02:01:52.627]  Well, you can't rely on the media, but I think that you'll be surprised the support he gets.
[02:01:52.748 --> 02:01:58.251]  I know, I go around and you'll be amazed at the people who say we love Donald Trump.
[02:01:58.571 --> 02:02:00.992]  They may not say it out front, but they do.
[02:02:01.132 --> 02:02:03.614]  That's that silent majority, believe me.
[02:02:04.234 --> 02:02:09.917]  And when he goes out front and he says, he likes to pass messages and use the media.
[02:02:10.438 --> 02:02:10.858]  I did it.
[02:02:10.878 --> 02:02:12.459]  I get in trouble sometimes.
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:14.181]  But why not pass?
[02:02:14.421 --> 02:02:17.462]  No, you said that the illegal immigration has declined.
[02:02:17.482 --> 02:02:19.723]  Yes, because of law enforcement.
[02:02:19.743 --> 02:02:21.064]  I'll tell you another reason.
[02:02:21.404 --> 02:02:22.685]  Because he went out front.
[02:02:23.305 --> 02:02:27.407]  He told the world, if you come into this country, you're going to jail.
[02:02:28.067 --> 02:02:29.108]  And they believe him.
[02:02:29.188 --> 02:02:32.349]  That's why they're not coming into this country because he spoke out.
[02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:35.551]  So one thing you have to do is speak out.
[02:02:36.271 --> 02:02:39.453]  And boy, you can move mountains sometimes when you speak out.
[02:02:40.262 --> 02:02:43.584]  I'm not saying that they're afraid of him, but he sends a message.
[02:02:43.604 --> 02:02:48.486]  Sure, but just like Merkel said, we're open, and 10 million Muslims, most of them men, poured in.
[02:02:48.667 --> 02:02:50.888]  She said, come, everything's free, and they came!
[02:02:52.289 --> 02:02:52.549]  Yeah.
[02:02:53.169 --> 02:02:54.470]  Yeah, that's the point I'm getting.
[02:02:55.070 --> 02:02:56.031]  So leave him alone.
[02:02:56.131 --> 02:02:59.312]  Every time he says something, they have to find fault with it.
[02:02:59.733 --> 02:03:02.274]  I'm so tired of this cable news.
[02:03:02.334 --> 02:03:07.437]  All they talk about when we have tornadoes, they have to go back to Russia, Russia.
[02:03:07.797 --> 02:03:09.618]  They're obsessed with Russia.
[02:03:11.131 --> 02:03:18.115]  Tell the people what's going on in this country and stop trying to destroy our president when they should be supporting.
[02:03:18.155 --> 02:03:19.916]  Democrats should be supporting him.
[02:03:20.437 --> 02:03:29.762]  These Republicans that don't like him because they probably have a personal vendetta because some of them ran for office and got wiped out.
[02:03:30.422 --> 02:03:31.723]  So, that's not right.
[02:03:32.043 --> 02:03:33.103]  Stick with the President.
[02:03:33.163 --> 02:03:34.284]  Let him do his job.
[02:03:34.504 --> 02:03:37.085]  Especially when North Korea just shot another missile at Japan.
[02:03:37.465 --> 02:03:39.166]  Especially when the world economy's on edge.
[02:03:40.126 --> 02:03:42.487]  The big banks are trying to plunge the economy to stop Trump.
[02:03:43.208 --> 02:03:44.088]  That is criminal!
[02:03:45.809 --> 02:03:51.851]  Yeah, a lot of stuff is criminal, but you'll never see anybody talk about it and so on.
[02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:57.894]  But I'll tell you, Alex, if we ever needed a President, it's time.
[02:03:58.846 --> 02:04:03.910]  With what has been going on under the previous administration, it's Donald Trump.
[02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:08.073]  He came at the right time and he's going to save this country.
[02:04:08.644 --> 02:04:13.226]  Just think if we kept going with Hillary in the same situation.
[02:04:13.666 --> 02:04:17.067]  So Donald Trump is going to save this country.
[02:04:17.127 --> 02:04:18.087]  I guarantee you.
[02:04:18.747 --> 02:04:20.228]  And I've been around a long time.
[02:04:20.288 --> 02:04:20.808]  No, I agree.
[02:04:20.848 --> 02:04:23.349]  America's being given the choice by God right now.
[02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:26.070]  Not that Trump's pervert or anybody is, but we're being given the choice.
[02:04:26.410 --> 02:04:28.611]  It's so clear with the antifa and all of this.
[02:04:28.631 --> 02:04:32.732]  We're going to pick them or we're going to pick prosperity and justice and a true free society.
[02:04:32.772 --> 02:04:35.373]  Sheriff Arpaio, thank you so much for the interview.
[02:04:35.733 --> 02:04:37.574]  And we'll be watching and talking to you very, very soon.
[02:04:37.594 --> 02:04:37.874]  Thank you.
[02:04:38.743 --> 02:04:39.143]  Thank you.
[02:04:39.984 --> 02:04:40.424]  There he goes.
[02:04:40.444 --> 02:04:42.946]  People can find him on Facebook, Twitter and more.
[02:04:42.966 --> 02:04:45.287]  Just Google Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the real sheriff.
[02:04:45.788 --> 02:04:50.331]  Be sure and follow him on Twitter right there at Joe Arpaio, real Sheriff Joe.
[02:04:50.751 --> 02:04:51.572]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:51.752 --> 02:04:56.215]  More intel with our reporters on the ground in Houston and more coming up.
[02:04:56.635 --> 02:05:02.399]  And we also have the lawsuit that just got thrown out with Hillary stealing the election and the nomination.
[02:05:05.268 --> 02:05:07.149]  Mark Moreno is our guest.
[02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:08.590]  He's been traveling the world.
[02:05:08.610 --> 02:05:11.191]  They've had arrest warrants out for him.
[02:05:11.231 --> 02:05:13.872]  They want him arrested here in the United States.
[02:05:13.992 --> 02:05:22.596]  The governor of New York wants him arrested because he dare questions Al Gore when Al Gore says the polar bears are all dying and can't swim.
[02:05:23.756 --> 02:05:24.637]  New York and L.A.
[02:05:24.657 --> 02:05:27.921]  would be underwater by 2013 because the ice caps were going to melt.
[02:05:28.061 --> 02:05:29.723]  Actually, Antarctic's at record levels.
[02:05:30.123 --> 02:05:32.886]  But they don't care because they can defraud the public.
[02:05:32.906 --> 02:05:37.632]  But recently, in Australia, he ran into Albert Gore.
[02:05:38.092 --> 02:05:41.036]  The guy that told us Napstangat was great and wanted us to have the TPP.
[02:05:41.556 --> 02:05:54.506]  The guy who uses 34 times what anybody, you know, uses on average in Tennessee at one of his gigantor mansions on a lake with gigantor boats and gigantor monster trucks and gigantor everything.
[02:05:54.566 --> 02:05:58.269]  But it's okay, because he's an elitist blubberbot.
[02:05:58.569 --> 02:06:04.073]  So here's the evil criminal, Mark Moreno, daring to even speak to the guru.
[02:06:04.193 --> 02:06:04.574]  Here it is.
[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:10.522]  Can I ask how you got in here?
[02:06:10.562 --> 02:06:12.383]  We've got double scum with us here.
[02:06:12.403 --> 02:06:20.326]  They dare talk to one of the greatest con artists on earth.
[02:06:20.446 --> 02:06:23.628]  How dare you speak to the royal highness?
[02:06:33.772 --> 02:06:35.713]  You're on fit to groom his stool.
[02:06:36.013 --> 02:06:41.117]  Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, what do you say for yourself?
[02:06:42.597 --> 02:06:44.158]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:06:45.239 --> 02:06:55.745]  Yes, I was in Australia, we were in Melbourne, Australia, and I had to sit through an hour and a half presentation by Al Gore previewing his new sequel, number one.
[02:06:55.785 --> 02:07:01.829]  Number two, we had to wait because Al Gore's devious plan included allowing the front row
[02:07:01.869 --> 02:07:02.189]  I don't know.
[02:07:17.638 --> 02:07:23.460]  Al Gore gives this presentation that's all anecdotal, just claptrap, and then immediately walks off the stage.
[02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:28.101]  He doesn't even take a single question after people paid $500 plus a head.
[02:07:28.121 --> 02:07:32.182]  He had no time for question and answer, so that's why I decided to follow him out.
[02:07:32.502 --> 02:07:33.383]  Was able to get that.
[02:07:33.443 --> 02:07:36.404]  He was all friendly when he thought I was nice, when he knew who I was.
[02:07:36.844 --> 02:07:43.986]  He literally just brushed me off, kept walking, and departed in his Lexus waiting SUV outside in the parking garage.
[02:07:44.508 --> 02:07:47.450]  And I love how there's some redhead lady toting behind.
[02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:50.452]  She's looking at him, breathing heavy, that she's just near him.
[02:07:50.893 --> 02:07:55.656]  Uh, uh, the guru, uh, I saw him sneeze.
[02:07:55.716 --> 02:07:58.078]  Some of his snot went in my mouth.
[02:07:58.378 --> 02:08:02.281]  And then she looks at you just like, uh, uh, uh, alright.
[02:08:16.334 --> 02:08:23.835]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.216 --> 02:08:41.978]  You know, I get constant calls from major newspapers asking me, how much do you talk to the president?
[02:08:43.379 --> 02:08:45.059]  And the answer is, very, very little.
[02:08:46.684 --> 02:08:50.166]  And then they never believe what I'm telling them because I think I'm liars like they are.
[02:08:50.186 --> 02:08:53.748]  And I'm just like, what is the point of me even taking time out to talk to you?
[02:08:54.388 --> 02:08:56.869]  Make up whatever it is you want to make up.
[02:08:57.709 --> 02:09:04.213]  That's why I very rarely even talk to them anymore because they just don't take what I say at face value.
[02:09:04.913 --> 02:09:06.314]  Why do you then have Jordan?
[02:09:07.492 --> 02:09:19.183]  Klepper launching a five-day-a-week show, or the Homeland Program admitting it's based on me but then lying about who I am, or the last X-Files series, the main character being Alex Jones.
[02:09:19.223 --> 02:09:20.964]  But on that show, he's a good guy.
[02:09:20.984 --> 02:09:25.789]  And Chris Carter said he thinks I'm a good guy and a libertarian.
[02:09:26.509 --> 02:09:27.910]  Because Chris Carter is a smart guy.
[02:09:27.930 --> 02:09:31.554]  And notice, I guess they're not picking it back up now, even though it was a hit.
[02:09:32.688 --> 02:09:44.871]  Everywhere else, there's like six different shows I know of currently that air weekly, and one that airs every day, and then you've got all the other programs, Colbert, and the Late Late Show, and all these other programs.
[02:09:45.391 --> 02:09:47.992]  I can't even watch 10% of it.
[02:09:48.072 --> 02:09:50.372]  I mean, it's every day.
[02:09:51.492 --> 02:09:54.173]  They've got people that they go, here's Alex Jones!
[02:09:55.313 --> 02:09:57.914]  And then the Alex Jones character comes out and says, I love the KKK!
[02:10:04.244 --> 02:10:09.388]  But then, I see clips of even Joe Rogan, who I've known since, like, 1998.
[02:10:09.508 --> 02:10:10.028]  I like him.
[02:10:10.048 --> 02:10:16.813]  When you've known somebody that long, he's a funny guy, but he's sitting there making jokes going, yeah, Alex says there's slave colonies on Mars.
[02:10:17.013 --> 02:10:17.874]  I never said that.
[02:10:18.294 --> 02:10:19.855]  Somebody else said that on my show.
[02:10:22.797 --> 02:10:23.798]  And I didn't agree with him.
[02:10:23.998 --> 02:10:27.040]  It's like if Eddie Bravo comes on Joe's show and says, the world's flat.
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:30.062]  Do I then go, yeah, Joe Rogan says the world's flat.
[02:10:30.102 --> 02:10:30.622]  Did you hear?
[02:10:31.523 --> 02:10:32.664]  Man, he's really lying.
[02:10:34.315 --> 02:10:35.976]  And Joe does it all good-natured, you know.
[02:10:37.257 --> 02:10:40.898]  When he sits there with these reporters and people, like Jon Ronson, I'm gonna play that clip.
[02:10:41.699 --> 02:10:42.819]  Like, let's just play that right now.
[02:10:42.839 --> 02:10:43.660]  Let's play that first.
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:56.387]  And then, I'm gonna send a clip of the young Turks yesterday, going, Alex Jones says there are clones that are 80% human, 80% pig, 80% cow.
[02:11:01.636 --> 02:11:16.642]  No, I said there are all sorts of different clones that are generally 80% or more human, and some are human clones, chimeras with pigs, and some are with cows, and some are with goats, and that's in the medical literature.
[02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:20.124]  But they say Jones doesn't know math!
[02:11:22.574 --> 02:11:28.739]  He said that there's creatures that are 80% this, 80% that, 80% this, thinking I don't know the math.
[02:11:28.999 --> 02:11:31.841]  If they're 80% something, they can only be 20% something else.
[02:11:32.481 --> 02:11:33.902]  But they don't know genes, actually.
[02:11:34.123 --> 02:11:38.126]  That's not what I said, but if you want to get technical, you can gene splice and layer genes?
[02:11:39.508 --> 02:11:43.891]  And have the genes of five people, complete genomes, and stack them, actually.
[02:11:44.071 --> 02:11:54.438]  So, they show their ignorance on top of it, but I'm putting on screen, every time I talk about human-animal chimeras, MIT, human-animal chimeras are gestating on U.S.
[02:11:54.478 --> 02:11:55.178]  research farms.
[02:11:55.218 --> 02:11:58.761]  That means in the stomachs, in the uteruses of cows.
[02:11:59.081 --> 02:12:05.825]  And millions of my listeners heard me say it 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, a year ago.
[02:12:07.566 --> 02:12:08.127]  And they know.
[02:12:10.316 --> 02:12:10.836]  That I was right.
[02:12:10.856 --> 02:12:11.457]  But then it gets worse.
[02:12:12.958 --> 02:12:14.399]  For some reason I couldn't sleep last night.
[02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:17.822]  And you know, but you're laying in bed and I was too lazy to get up and take a knockout.
[02:12:18.922 --> 02:12:22.165]  Should have gone taking that, but I just kind of rolled around a couple hours till like two in the morning.
[02:12:22.485 --> 02:12:24.286]  So I started watching videos on my phone.
[02:12:24.547 --> 02:12:26.308]  That's why I watched more than I usually do.
[02:12:26.368 --> 02:12:35.355]  And just YouTube was just full of, of, of just, you know, John Ronson attacking me and, and, and Joe Rogan, uh, and,
[02:12:36.536 --> 02:12:44.860]  You know, the Daily Show, and the Late Late Show, and Kepler, and Klepper, or whatever his name is, and I couldn't read it all, I couldn't watch it all.
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:47.221]  I just watched a few of them, and I said, what's this?
[02:12:47.821 --> 02:12:49.022]  And I knew what it was when I saw it.
[02:12:49.062 --> 02:12:55.284]  It was the young Turks going, Trump gives military equipment including grenade launchers to the police.
[02:12:56.365 --> 02:13:01.167]  And I knew when I watched it, she'd say, grenade launchers to shoot people with grenades!
[02:13:03.188 --> 02:13:05.689]  It's the old Army-Navy surplus program going back
[02:13:07.035 --> 02:13:07.415]  50 years.
[02:13:08.636 --> 02:13:12.958]  You can argue whether it's good or bad, but they weren't giving grenades for grenade launchers.
[02:13:13.218 --> 02:13:15.820]  They're giving them tear gas grenades.
[02:13:16.903 --> 02:13:18.204]  But see, leave that out!
[02:13:18.464 --> 02:13:21.726]  My gosh, Trump's giving grenades to the police!
[02:13:22.006 --> 02:13:28.130]  But it's the way this dirty, Soros, Hillary-funded, you know, deal that helped spike the election for Sanders.
[02:13:28.611 --> 02:13:30.832]  They got paid $20 million to do that, reportedly.
[02:13:31.613 --> 02:13:38.317]  And they just sit up there with the Young Turks name that was the fascist group in World War I that killed every Christian in...
[02:13:40.475 --> 02:13:40.835]  Turkey.
[02:13:41.496 --> 02:13:45.219]  The Armenian genocide, which he says didn't happen and makes a joke out of.
[02:13:45.259 --> 02:13:57.249]  It's just like, they're calling me a fascist and Trump a fascist, and there's a big, oily fascist making jokes about human-animal experimentation, knowing full well it's all real.
[02:13:57.850 --> 02:14:01.233]  But the talking point put up by Media Matters is that I said
[02:14:03.641 --> 02:14:06.064]  That there are creatures that are 240% something.
[02:14:06.084 --> 02:14:07.826]  Didn't say they were 80% this, 80% that, 80% this.
[02:14:07.866 --> 02:14:09.788]  I said there are all sorts of creatures that are 10% human, 90% pig.
[02:14:20.696 --> 02:14:27.858]  99% human, 1% goat, and it depends on how they want to implant the humanoids in uterus.
[02:14:28.319 --> 02:14:36.141]  Sometimes it's a mix of different creatures and then they grow them up larger in cows because they can harvest larger organs out of that.
[02:14:36.521 --> 02:14:39.482]  That was in the BBC 20 years ago.
[02:14:39.882 --> 02:14:41.543]  That's how I know about it.
[02:14:42.878 --> 02:14:44.879]  So they made kind of a man-bear-pig joke.
[02:14:44.939 --> 02:14:46.680]  You know, half man, half bear, half pig.
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:48.181]  You know, I know that's a joke.
[02:14:48.541 --> 02:14:49.422]  I wasn't joking.
[02:14:49.562 --> 02:14:52.764]  I was being serious about 80% human, 20% cow.
[02:14:53.324 --> 02:14:54.665]  80% human, 20% pig.
[02:14:55.065 --> 02:14:58.467]  They knew what I was doing, but they edited it to make it sound like I'm completely insane.
[02:14:59.607 --> 02:15:00.868]  And this is how they deceive.
[02:15:00.908 --> 02:15:05.011]  Now, Joe can just see all the demonization and all the attacks and...
[02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:06.830]  You know, it's just kind of fun.
[02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:14.372]  Oh, Alex is a good guy, but yeah, he did make up the Mars bases, and yeah, you know, he does make up false flags and stuff, and it's okay.
[02:15:15.653 --> 02:15:23.555]  It's just that I then don't really get a chance to respond to that on his show, so I'm responding to it here just for the record.
[02:15:25.075 --> 02:15:28.156]  But, it's the young Turks.
[02:15:28.256 --> 02:15:34.878]  I don't know why he lets the female co-host, because he supports it, you know, not be on there without a hood over her head, with his Hillary money and the rest of it.
[02:15:35.973 --> 02:15:36.033]  And
[02:15:56.047 --> 02:16:06.070]  Crossroads of liberal and conservatism and having these big intellectual discussions and everything, and it's easy to sit up on the mountain and, you know, oh, Alex says that Jewish actors did.
[02:16:07.110 --> 02:16:08.390]  Charlottesville didn't say that.
[02:16:08.991 --> 02:16:12.251]  Or Alex says there's slave bases on the moon or on Mars.
[02:16:12.291 --> 02:16:12.872]  Didn't say that.
[02:16:14.512 --> 02:16:17.353]  But I understand, you know, that just read a mainstream headline and
[02:16:18.476 --> 02:16:19.177]  Just kind of go with it.
[02:16:19.217 --> 02:16:20.137]  But Joe's smarter than that.
[02:16:20.177 --> 02:16:22.439]  He knows they're lying, or taking out of context.
[02:16:22.619 --> 02:16:23.620]  He knows it's a cheap shot.
[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:24.500]  But that's fine!
[02:16:25.081 --> 02:16:42.553]  Because I'm getting talked about, and there's 15 TV shows about me, and all this demonization attacks, because I identified globalism, I identified the NSA grid, I identified the chimeras, I identified the chemicals in the water, I identified their entire world government program, and have been proven absolutely correct!
[02:16:42.993 --> 02:16:44.174]  And that's why I'm dangerous!
[02:16:44.414 --> 02:16:47.757]  And that's why everybody else wants to get little brownie points with the establishment,
[02:16:48.717 --> 02:16:50.958]  They're kind of stepping and fetching it and everything, and I get it.
[02:16:51.239 --> 02:16:56.302]  But there'll be no future for anybody if men in this country don't start getting serious.
[02:16:56.662 --> 02:17:07.728]  It's an abomination to have a guy calling his group the Young Turks, funded by Qatar and other dictatorships, running down our president and running me down and lying.
[02:17:08.429 --> 02:17:13.292]  So Joe's just having some fun with his guests, kind of taking their attacks, and I don't mind it.
[02:17:13.852 --> 02:17:15.013]  But as for people like
[02:17:17.168 --> 02:17:18.890]  Sinker the Turd or whatever his name is.
[02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:19.830]  He's a fraud.
[02:17:20.131 --> 02:17:21.512]  So let's go ahead and play a clip from Joe.
[02:17:21.552 --> 02:17:21.932]  Here it is.
[02:17:23.474 --> 02:17:24.254]  I now wonder.
[02:17:24.354 --> 02:17:28.418]  So he says that Trump called him just after the election to thank him.
[02:17:28.838 --> 02:17:33.642]  And I'm inclined to believe that's true because I don't think that's the kind of thing that Alex would lie about.
[02:17:34.063 --> 02:17:35.124]  You don't hit pause.
[02:17:36.725 --> 02:17:37.786]  I'm going to explain something.
[02:17:39.025 --> 02:17:42.366]  When Trump goes to a rally, a third or more of the people are wearing my t-shirts.
[02:17:42.886 --> 02:17:44.606]  His security detail is handing him my stuff.
[02:17:44.806 --> 02:17:46.286]  The CIA is giving him stuff.
[02:17:46.506 --> 02:17:47.667]  It's raining down on him.
[02:17:47.867 --> 02:17:49.047]  Our information is everywhere.
[02:17:49.387 --> 02:17:50.887]  Drudge's information is everywhere.
[02:17:51.127 --> 02:17:52.087]  We're respected.
[02:17:52.308 --> 02:17:54.928]  Trump knows we're real news versus what you say.
[02:17:55.488 --> 02:17:57.769]  So again, they want to say we're discredited, we're kooks, we're jokes.
[02:17:58.149 --> 02:18:00.389]  Nobody listens, but the whole world's obsessed.
[02:18:02.529 --> 02:18:04.650]  Not just the president, focused.
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:06.821]  So again, oh, they're going to judge.
[02:18:06.921 --> 02:18:09.503]  Is he really telling the truth about the president?
[02:18:09.603 --> 02:18:11.185]  If you only knew, ding dong.
[02:18:11.205 --> 02:18:23.094]  I know you're so important and you're up there on the mountain and you're going to decide what's real because of your superior intellect and Irving Joes is going to look into it, oh yes, and Martian bases.
[02:18:23.314 --> 02:18:25.116]  Play a clip of me saying Martian bases.
[02:18:25.476 --> 02:18:26.417]  You can't do it.
[02:18:27.738 --> 02:18:29.419]  You got to build a straw man, don't you?
[02:18:29.839 --> 02:18:30.380]  Let's finish up.
[02:18:32.057 --> 02:18:33.498]  Yeah, he knows he's being isolated, he does.
[02:18:58.291 --> 02:19:02.553]  Just last week was the headline, Infowars banned at the White House by General Kelly.
[02:19:03.474 --> 02:19:04.775]  They didn't even say because it's fake news.
[02:19:05.095 --> 02:19:06.876]  They said because the President acts upon it.
[02:19:09.577 --> 02:19:13.399]  But I don't need to be big because the President watches and listens.
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:15.701]  We brought the President.
[02:19:15.761 --> 02:19:16.581]  He brought himself.
[02:19:16.681 --> 02:19:17.502]  We're together.
[02:19:17.582 --> 02:19:18.442]  We're the movement.
[02:19:18.642 --> 02:19:20.643]  We're exposing globalism, world government.
[02:19:20.803 --> 02:19:21.864]  Remember it didn't exist?
[02:19:22.865 --> 02:19:24.305]  Now it's all admitted to exist?
[02:19:26.927 --> 02:19:27.067]  See?
[02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:34.931]  And then they show a bunch of viral stories of the week and try to misrepresent what we say and what we do.
[02:19:35.651 --> 02:19:36.872]  But that's the reality.
[02:19:37.612 --> 02:19:43.595]  So just understand that that's what's really happening here.
[02:19:43.615 --> 02:19:45.456]  So we're going to go back and get to it.
[02:19:46.096 --> 02:19:47.297]  The Mars base.
[02:19:47.457 --> 02:19:48.978]  But there's no clip of me saying it.
[02:19:51.018 --> 02:19:54.079]  Just like there's no clip of me saying Jewish actors staged Charlottesville.
[02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:59.561]  But it doesn't matter because see, if you build a straw man, you can get in the ring with a straw man and kick its ass, can't you?
[02:19:59.801 --> 02:20:02.381]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:20:12.384 --> 02:20:13.865]  This memo will bring down the traitors.
[02:20:14.325 --> 02:20:17.886]  McMasters doesn't want you, Deep State doesn't want you to read this memo.
[02:20:19.369 --> 02:20:20.589]  I mean, talk about traitors.
[02:20:20.629 --> 02:20:25.031]  You've got McMaster granting Susan Rice her same level of security clearance.
[02:20:25.171 --> 02:20:29.392]  At the same time, Trump is actively saying, we need to find the leakers.
[02:20:29.752 --> 02:20:30.653]  I'm being surveilled.
[02:20:30.933 --> 02:20:31.753]  Oh no, you're not.
[02:20:31.793 --> 02:20:32.753]  That's a big lie.
[02:20:32.813 --> 02:20:33.874]  How are you going to lie to the people?
[02:20:33.974 --> 02:20:36.394]  No, they wiretapped Trump Tower.
[02:20:36.794 --> 02:20:44.097]  And so at the same time that Trump is saying this to the American people, McMaster is saying, I don't think Susan Rice did anything wrong.
[02:20:44.177 --> 02:20:47.698]  I'm going to allow her to still have her same level of security clearance.
[02:20:48.318 --> 02:20:49.300]  It's insane!
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.502]  Why are the neocons surrounding Trump?
[02:20:51.722 --> 02:20:52.584]  What do they have on him?
[02:20:52.724 --> 02:20:53.425]  What's happening?
[02:20:54.005 --> 02:21:04.237]  Well again, they even admit in the memo, as I've said on air without the memo, the Bolsheviks, same globalist operatives, they created a state within a state for years and Russia only controlled Moscow.
[02:21:04.858 --> 02:21:09.360]  And then they got everybody through time to turn in their guns through propaganda, then they slaughtered millions of people.
[02:21:09.821 --> 02:21:12.602]  So they admit that it is a Maoist strategy.
[02:21:12.622 --> 02:21:14.043]  That's what the weatherman taught Obama.
[02:21:14.283 --> 02:21:20.586]  They are all carrying out a Maoist strategy with deep staters and cowards like McMasters and others that Trump picked.
[02:21:20.666 --> 02:21:27.530]  They get approached by deep state, they get scared, and they join with it because they want to play golf and do whatever while we're being carted off to death camps.
[02:21:27.910 --> 02:21:31.596]  And, you know, pot-bellied liberals are kicking our brains out and raping our families, literally.
[02:21:31.977 --> 02:21:37.205]  That's what the left talks about, how they're going to rape us, how they're going to murder us, how they're going to have all these little nobodies.
[02:21:37.566 --> 02:21:41.793]  This is their existential dream of power, is to run around defecating on everybody.
[02:21:43.669 --> 02:21:46.510]  Well, people need to look no further than Venezuela and what happened.
[02:21:46.530 --> 02:21:49.470]  That's the exact same thing that they did there just several years ago.
[02:21:49.551 --> 02:21:50.671]  They got rid of the guns.
[02:21:50.731 --> 02:21:53.512]  Everyone turn in your guns because we want to be a peaceful nation.
[02:21:53.532 --> 02:22:07.135]  And then just about a year or so later, we saw the total collapse there where the government was actually purging people who are eating dogs and giraffes out of the zoo, purging them because they don't have the guns or anything to fight back.
[02:22:08.858 --> 02:22:11.880]  Yeah, it only shows their hand even so more.
[02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:14.961]  When the minute you start telling the truth, they try to slap you down.
[02:22:15.021 --> 02:22:19.543]  The minute they start sharing anything that has a headline that's anti them, they try to ban it.
[02:22:19.823 --> 02:22:26.067]  They are going to be forcing their hand so much that they're showing us, they're exposing us what their actual plans are.
[02:22:26.367 --> 02:22:30.809]  They're trying to ban us, they're trying to shut us down, they're trying to fire people for speaking the truth.
[02:22:31.089 --> 02:22:33.190]  That's only going to mean that more people are going to hear it.
[02:22:33.210 --> 02:22:34.691]  We're not the radicals saying all this.
[02:22:34.731 --> 02:22:36.412]  They're on C-SPAN.
[02:22:37.432 --> 02:22:44.381]  At the Aspen Institute with Wolf Blitzer, Brennan, and Clapper saying a violent overthrow is coming in the next few months.
[02:22:44.701 --> 02:22:45.883]  Don't wait for impeachment.
[02:22:45.923 --> 02:22:46.924]  We're now moving.
[02:22:47.265 --> 02:22:49.808]  And then Al Gore goes on the Late Late Show and says the same thing.
[02:22:50.168 --> 02:22:51.670]  I mean, they are doing it!

[02:24:11.957 --> 02:24:15.098]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and I want to be clear.
[02:24:15.478 --> 02:24:16.499]  I'm good friends with Joe.
[02:24:16.579 --> 02:24:17.219]  I respect him.
[02:24:17.279 --> 02:24:17.739]  He's funny.
[02:24:17.779 --> 02:24:18.219]  He's great.
[02:24:18.799 --> 02:24:29.983]  I know in the larger podcast, because I watch it a lot when I'm on the treadmill or whatever, and the crew was making the point, they saw this whole episode, I hadn't seen this whole episode, that he basically had my back for most of it and just a little controversial part was put out.
[02:24:30.543 --> 02:24:33.464]  But still, he's going with headlines that are not true.
[02:24:33.904 --> 02:24:35.985]  And it was in thousands of headlines that I said that there's
[02:24:37.245 --> 02:24:38.845]  Slave colonies of children on Mars.
[02:24:39.045 --> 02:24:39.986]  I did not say that.
[02:24:40.306 --> 02:24:47.447]  I had a high-level CIA guy on who's been on for 15 years and just blurted that out, and I think on purpose to be discrediting.
[02:24:47.747 --> 02:24:48.548]  But I can't prove that.
[02:24:48.568 --> 02:24:51.488]  I like Robert David Steele, but he really, I mean, that's just crazy.
[02:24:52.329 --> 02:24:54.509]  Buzz Aldrin came on once and was saying stuff like that.
[02:24:54.569 --> 02:24:57.930]  I mean, I'm not a kook because I had the second guy to walk on the moon.
[02:24:58.650 --> 02:25:00.391]  Okay, and I don't deny we went to the moon either.
[02:25:00.411 --> 02:25:02.312]  I said there's a lot of secret technology there.
[02:25:02.752 --> 02:25:11.357]  The point is, is that the whole media is coming out against me, and now is not the time for people to think piling on is going to get anybody anywhere.
[02:25:11.877 --> 02:25:14.379]  The globalists need to be stood against, period.
[02:25:15.079 --> 02:25:24.585]  But let's finish up this clip, then I'm going to get to the real baloney artist, sinker, ooger, pooker, bluebird, whatever, I can't pronounce his name, of the young turdlets.
[02:25:24.625 --> 02:25:24.965]  Here it is.
[02:25:26.593 --> 02:25:31.955]  I mean, first of all, I don't see how Trump can have a connection with that many people.
[02:25:32.176 --> 02:25:37.278]  I feel like the job of being the president has got to be so insanely demanding.
[02:25:37.678 --> 02:25:50.064]  The idea that he's taking a few moments out of his day, he's got his feet up on the chair with a laptop, and he's on Infowars.com, he's like, I gotta call Alex and remind him what the f*** is going on with this child slavery thing on Mars.
[02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:54.358]  Alex, where are these slaves?
[02:25:54.658 --> 02:25:55.238]  Tell me where.
[02:25:55.418 --> 02:25:56.058]  We're on Mars.
[02:25:56.819 --> 02:26:01.620]  I think it benefits everyone to think they're Alex because it makes Trump look bad.
[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:02.641]  Yeah.
[02:26:02.661 --> 02:26:07.302]  So it benefits people on the left to say that Alex is connected to Trump.
[02:26:07.563 --> 02:26:07.883]  Yeah.
[02:26:08.023 --> 02:26:10.464]  It kind of benefits Alex, I think, for people to think it too.
[02:26:10.504 --> 02:26:11.224]  Let's stop right there.
[02:26:11.564 --> 02:26:13.025]  And Ronson's a really smart guy.
[02:26:13.065 --> 02:26:14.405]  What he's saying there is actually true.
[02:26:15.125 --> 02:26:16.486]  Then he goes on to call me a liar next.
[02:26:16.506 --> 02:26:18.046]  You can see the whole thing if you want.
[02:26:18.066 --> 02:26:19.387]  I don't mind going by the rest of it.
[02:26:20.984 --> 02:26:25.926]  That yes, they've been trying to hurt Trump with me, but it only gives him more cred because folks hate the establishment.
[02:26:26.426 --> 02:26:35.650]  They still think they're so powerful at CNN and MSNBC and the New York Times that lying about what I've said, misrepresenting it, and throwing it at the President makes people hate him.
[02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:37.091]  It makes them like him more.
[02:26:37.331 --> 02:26:39.452]  They want somebody that's on the outside.
[02:26:39.812 --> 02:26:41.393]  Now let's get to a really bad dude.
[02:26:41.773 --> 02:26:43.814]  Money from hardcore Middle Eastern dictators.
[02:26:44.774 --> 02:26:51.299]  Sold out Bernie Sanders for Hillary, went along with the election being stolen, got a bunch of money from the DNC, called it a grassroots movement.
[02:26:51.359 --> 02:26:56.303]  I mean, you know, the jury's out on, like is Joel Olsteen bad?
[02:26:56.463 --> 02:27:03.489]  The jury's in on Sinker Uygur of the young fascist of Turkey, here pontificating.
[02:27:03.829 --> 02:27:07.032]  And here he is lying about me saying that people are 80%, 80%, 80%.
[02:27:07.132 --> 02:27:07.872]  Notice he doesn't show a clip.
[02:27:10.814 --> 02:27:14.438]  He reads a false text out of context.
[02:27:14.498 --> 02:27:14.898]  Here it is.
[02:27:16.921 --> 02:27:27.172]  Alex Jones said that there are humanoids, quote, humanoids, and they are, quote, like 80% gorilla and 80% pig, and they're talking.
[02:27:28.888 --> 02:27:39.541]  So the president is listening to a guy who thinks there are humanoids that are 80% gorilla and 80% pig, do the math on that one, and that those are 860% bear pigs are talking humanoids.
[02:27:43.874 --> 02:27:48.076]  I'm sure he has some sort of product that he can sell us that can prevent us or keep us safe.
[02:27:48.236 --> 02:27:53.059]  Yeah, I sell some of the same products that Bezos that helps fund you sells at Whole Foods.
[02:27:53.979 --> 02:27:56.220]  And I don't get money from Qatar and dictatorships.
[02:27:56.740 --> 02:28:02.283]  And I don't have the name the Young Turks that are the greatest genocidal group ever against Christians in modern history.
[02:28:02.523 --> 02:28:05.785]  Yes, I didn't name myself after a proto-Nazi organization.
[02:28:06.405 --> 02:28:07.766]  Yes, you're absolutely right.
[02:28:08.046 --> 02:28:09.607]  That was, by the way, German-funded, I should add.
[02:28:09.627 --> 02:28:11.588]  I mean, you just can't make this up.
[02:28:11.848 --> 02:28:16.510]  So, now let's go to the other clip of her, little Miss Jihad over there.
[02:28:17.810 --> 02:28:23.813]  Why she's not wearing her burka, I don't know, because they're a pro-sharia over there.
[02:28:24.854 --> 02:28:30.276]  So, let's go ahead and play the clip of her claiming that Trump's giving grenade launchers.
[02:28:30.456 --> 02:28:32.477]  They don't tell you the same canister shoots tear gas.
[02:28:32.738 --> 02:28:35.179]  He's giving them the launchers for tear gas.
[02:28:36.229 --> 02:28:40.175]  So taxpayers don't have to pay for it when Antifa is running around beating everybody up.
[02:28:40.816 --> 02:28:45.142]  See, it's just this anti-government thing because they want to overthrow it.
[02:28:45.202 --> 02:28:46.644]  It's what Muslims do.
[02:28:46.864 --> 02:28:47.245]  Here it is.
[02:28:47.711 --> 02:28:53.912]  Donald Trump plans to revive a program that provides local law enforcement with militarized weapons.
[02:28:54.192 --> 02:29:05.655]  Now this was something that President Obama decided to rein in when he realized that local police forces were heavily militarized and it was leading to problems within communities throughout the country.
[02:29:06.055 --> 02:29:09.656]  However, Trump believes that reviving this program is just a great idea.
[02:29:09.676 --> 02:29:11.296]  So let me give you the details on that.
[02:29:11.476 --> 02:29:19.262]  He will revive a program that provides local police departments with surplus military equipment such as high-caliber weapons and grenade launchers.
[02:29:19.362 --> 02:29:20.123]  Let's stop right there.
[02:29:20.443 --> 02:29:20.964]  More lies.
[02:29:21.604 --> 02:29:24.626]  Now, again, they fomented all the race war.
[02:29:24.667 --> 02:29:27.449]  They got the cops to not go into the neighborhoods where they're not wanted.
[02:29:28.089 --> 02:29:30.191]  Thousands dead every year in Chicago.
[02:29:30.211 --> 02:29:32.052]  A hundred dead by cops or something.
[02:29:33.323 --> 02:29:34.324]  There was no issue.
[02:29:34.344 --> 02:29:35.324]  There was no crisis.
[02:29:35.424 --> 02:29:36.225]  You made it up.
[02:29:36.485 --> 02:29:41.367]  Part of the strong city initiative of Loretta Lynch to cause a race war in federalized police.
[02:29:41.688 --> 02:29:43.468]  You little stinker, you!
[02:29:44.149 --> 02:29:50.852]  We'll be right back with the lawsuit getting thrown out exposing Hillary's election fraud against Bernie Sanders.
[02:29:50.872 --> 02:29:52.193]  But the Young Turks don't care about that.
[02:29:52.934 --> 02:29:54.754]  They got all that money from the DNC!
[02:29:54.815 --> 02:29:55.175]  Yay!
[02:29:55.375 --> 02:29:59.137]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.545 --> 02:30:08.066]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[02:30:08.526 --> 02:30:14.568]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[02:30:14.988 --> 02:30:17.769]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:18.149 --> 02:30:21.170]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:30:21.350 --> 02:30:24.811]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[02:30:25.131 --> 02:30:25.591]  The left
[02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:36.575]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:30:36.615 --> 02:30:39.036]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[02:30:39.516 --> 02:30:43.377]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:30:43.437 --> 02:30:51.500]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:54.461]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[02:30:54.841 --> 02:30:58.002]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[02:30:58.082 --> 02:30:59.763]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[02:30:59.923 --> 02:31:01.103]  It's available right now.
[02:31:01.423 --> 02:31:03.964]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:04.324 --> 02:31:08.725]  We have the new product at infowarslife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:31:08.805 --> 02:31:19.749]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:31:19.909 --> 02:31:24.832]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:31:24.952 --> 02:31:27.473]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:31:27.533 --> 02:31:29.034]  It helps detoxify.
[02:31:29.234 --> 02:31:32.076]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:31:32.136 --> 02:31:36.878]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:31:36.898 --> 02:31:43.142]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:31:43.162 --> 02:31:48.484]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:31:48.584 --> 02:31:49.245]  I'm taking it now.
[02:31:49.565 --> 02:31:50.005]  Every day.
[02:31:50.205 --> 02:31:50.946]  This is so key.
[02:31:51.186 --> 02:31:53.488]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[02:31:53.748 --> 02:31:55.469]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:31:55.509 --> 02:31:57.611]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:31:57.731 --> 02:32:01.193]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:09.571 --> 02:32:16.175]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[02:32:16.415 --> 02:32:18.797]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[02:32:18.957 --> 02:32:22.259]  Not in the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[02:32:22.419 --> 02:32:24.560]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:29.283]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[02:32:29.443 --> 02:32:32.205]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[02:32:32.325 --> 02:32:35.247]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews.
[02:32:35.307 --> 02:32:36.527]  4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:40.249]  Unprecedented.
[02:32:40.329 --> 02:32:41.390]  And it's cold-pressed.
[02:32:41.550 --> 02:32:43.450]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[02:32:43.470 --> 02:32:46.391]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science.
[02:32:46.451 --> 02:32:51.833]  These are other... What you sell, they... BuzzFeed said, it's like, there's already best-selling stuff that's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[02:32:51.893 --> 02:32:53.074]  Why these aren't anything new?
[02:32:53.094 --> 02:32:57.155]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[02:32:57.355 --> 02:32:57.575]  Duh!
[02:32:57.615 --> 02:32:57.735]  Duh!
[02:33:08.030 --> 02:33:14.331]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.012 --> 02:33:19.152]  It turns out we are in the Twilight Zone.
[02:33:35.481 --> 02:33:36.524]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:33:36.544 --> 02:33:37.687]  We're about to go to our guest.
[02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:40.816]  You know, there are some people out there like Mark Rich.
[02:33:42.117 --> 02:33:46.460]  Others that were investigating the fact that Bernie Sanders publicly had the nomination stolen from him.
[02:33:47.121 --> 02:33:48.462]  He was winning all the first primaries.
[02:33:48.502 --> 02:33:50.504]  They would just give Hillary the delegates.
[02:33:51.404 --> 02:33:52.905]  The Republicans tried the same thing with Trump.
[02:33:53.005 --> 02:34:05.835]  And, you know, whether you like Bernie Sanders or hate him, whether you like Donald Trump or hate him, these are both populist, maverick types that Americans across the board saw as anti-establishment.
[02:34:07.156 --> 02:34:10.239]  And now to make sure Bernie Sanders doesn't complain too much, you notice that
[02:34:11.872 --> 02:34:13.754]  No, they've got all those investigations of them going on.
[02:34:14.414 --> 02:34:20.539]  And now we have a Florida judge dismisses fraud lawsuit against the DNC.
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:28.226]  Elizabeth Beck is an attorney and founded Jampact, the first and only truly progressive grassroots super PAC.
[02:34:28.246 --> 02:34:31.889]  It is powered by ordinary citizens to serve the public rather than billionaires, corporations.
[02:34:31.929 --> 02:34:33.411]  Jampact aims to hold
[02:34:34.434 --> 02:34:36.236]  Politicians accountable to the citizenry.
[02:34:36.616 --> 02:34:40.159]  Its goal is to restore the voice of the people to government.
[02:34:40.779 --> 02:34:49.527]  Elizabeth holds a law degree from Yale Law School and a bachelor's of science degree in mathematics from the University of California at Los Angeles.
[02:34:49.567 --> 02:34:53.049]  And here's the Washington Post, Associated Press, they all ran it.
[02:34:53.450 --> 02:34:59.275]  A year-long legal battle over the Democratic National Committee's handling of the 2016 presidential primary came to an end Friday.
[02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:05.681]  With the federal judge in Florida dismissing a class action suit brought by supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders.
[02:35:06.121 --> 02:35:14.403]  And here to give us the details of this and this defeat, well I'm no lawyer but I covered it all, I know election law looks very cut and dry.
[02:35:15.463 --> 02:35:23.545]  Parties may claim that primary votes are ceremonial but you've got public money being spent on elections, you've got the Constitution, clearly it's not.
[02:35:23.925 --> 02:35:25.465]  But they're trying to set that precedent.
[02:35:25.846 --> 02:35:27.546]  Republicans tried it, they failed.
[02:35:28.459 --> 02:35:31.281]  But maybe that's because the field was a little bit bigger with Hillary.
[02:35:31.321 --> 02:35:33.102]  It was just Hillary and Bernie there at the end.
[02:35:33.822 --> 02:35:41.387]  But again, Attorney Elizabeth Beck joins us doing really important work for the integrity of our electoral system.
[02:35:41.407 --> 02:35:42.087]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:35:43.148 --> 02:35:45.129]  Thank you for making the time, Alex.
[02:35:46.590 --> 02:35:56.256]  On May 1st, 2013, you, Alex Jones, published an article on InfoWars.
[02:35:58.553 --> 02:36:04.816]  The title of the article was, FBI Report Implicates Saudi Government in 9-11.
[02:36:06.957 --> 02:36:18.782]  The first sentence of this article that you published on Infowars states, Contrary to the official narrative, 9-11 was state-sponsored terror.
[02:36:19.703 --> 02:36:22.424]  The only question is which state sponsored it.
[02:36:24.825 --> 02:36:26.566]  The article goes on to say,
[02:36:29.639 --> 02:36:35.363]  That the Broward Bulldogs FOIA lawsuit asks U.S.
[02:36:35.584 --> 02:36:48.694]  District Judge William Zlotch to order the FBI to produce all records of its Sarasota investigation, including the records seen by Graham.
[02:36:52.437 --> 02:36:57.801]  Alex, what does, what do Antonin Scalia,
[02:37:00.828 --> 02:37:07.651]  Sheila Abduz-Salam and Teori Zavaski have in common.
[02:37:07.851 --> 02:37:08.772]  The 28 pages?
[02:37:10.052 --> 02:37:10.292]  No.
[02:37:11.173 --> 02:37:23.058]  What do these three people, Antonin Scalia, Sheila Abduz-Salam, and Teori Zavaski have in common?
[02:37:23.178 --> 02:37:23.738]  Are they dead?
[02:37:24.799 --> 02:37:28.080]  They are dead, and they also have something else in common.
[02:37:31.578 --> 02:37:32.518]  They are all judges.
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:39.621]  Antonin Scalia was a United States Supreme Court judge.
[02:37:40.322 --> 02:37:43.583]  He passed away on February 13, 2016.
[02:37:45.083 --> 02:37:49.965]  He was found dead in his sleep as a guest in a West Texas ranch.
[02:37:50.366 --> 02:37:52.266]  There was no autopsy.
[02:37:54.027 --> 02:37:57.668]  Four days before, on February 9, 2016, John Podesta,
[02:38:02.411 --> 02:38:18.022]  Secretary Hillary Clinton's campaign sends an email to Steve Elmendorf saying, quote, didn't think Whitworks meant pool parties at the Vineyard, end quote.
[02:38:19.363 --> 02:38:24.827]  Steve responds, quote, I am all in, end quote.
[02:38:26.788 --> 02:38:29.630]  On the day of the Supreme Court Justice's death,
[02:38:30.908 --> 02:38:39.331]  February 13, 2016, Milia Fisher emails John Podesta links on the justice's death.
[02:38:40.532 --> 02:38:54.797]  Also, she sends him an older Washington Post link from December 31st, 2015, about how a Supreme Court vacancy would favor Democrats.
[02:38:57.799 --> 02:39:02.744]  These emails were released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta emails.
[02:39:05.506 --> 02:39:21.601]  On November 6, 2016, a few days before the presidential election, Newsweek publishes an article entitled, With Vote Looming, What Happens With the Supreme Court Vacancy?
[02:39:24.255 --> 02:39:33.319]  Approximately a month before the presidential election, on October 19, 2016, CNN publishes an article.
[02:39:34.539 --> 02:39:40.421]  It is titled, Questions for Clinton and Trump on the Supreme Court, end quote.
[02:39:41.082 --> 02:39:49.305]  The article begins with, quote, the future of the Supreme Court hangs on the next election.
[02:39:53.647 --> 02:39:58.211]  Sheila Abdusalam was a justice on the New York Court of Appeals.
[02:40:00.594 --> 02:40:02.956]  She died on April 12, 2017.
[02:40:04.017 --> 02:40:05.919]  Her body was fished out of the Hudson.
[02:40:06.619 --> 02:40:09.362]  There were bruises on her neck and no suicide note.
[02:40:11.994 --> 02:40:14.756]  Her husband disputed the ruling of suicide.
[02:40:15.496 --> 02:40:21.339]  She was the first African-American woman to be appointed to a seat on New York's highest court.
[02:40:21.399 --> 02:40:31.405]  And just to be clear, we joined this Florida judge's Mrs. Fraud Lawsuit against DNC, where they publicly stole the nomination from the voters that went for Bernie Sanders, hands down.
[02:40:31.705 --> 02:40:34.107]  And you're tying all this, all this together.
[02:40:34.127 --> 02:40:34.507]  I'll get to that.
[02:40:34.827 --> 02:40:35.347]  Yeah, please continue.
[02:40:35.367 --> 02:40:35.808]  I'll get to that.
[02:40:39.912 --> 02:40:44.033]  Teori Zavasky died on January 19th of this year.
[02:40:45.093 --> 02:40:47.754]  He was a justice on the Brazilian Supreme Court.
[02:40:48.594 --> 02:40:51.135]  He died when his small plane crashed.
[02:40:51.915 --> 02:41:07.299]  He was appointed by former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to investigate widespread corruption in the financial and government elite in Brazil, and was in charge of handling the Operation Car Wash corruption trials.
[02:41:08.328 --> 02:41:13.512]  Operation Car Wash is an ongoing criminal investigation begun in 2014.
[02:41:13.612 --> 02:41:25.800]  Rousseff was impeached on August 31st, 2016 and replaced by Michael Temer as President of Brazil.
[02:41:28.782 --> 02:41:32.485]  Five months later, the head judge, Teori Zavosky, is dead.
[02:41:33.948 --> 02:41:39.472]  Tamir's new finance minister has appointed Ilan Goldfein as central bank president.
[02:41:40.153 --> 02:41:50.141]  Goldfein, who has a PhD from MIT, has formerly worked as a consultant for the World Bank, the IMF, and the United Nations.
[02:41:57.409 --> 02:42:00.370]  Okay, so I mean I understand there's a lot of corruption, a lot of murders going on.
[02:42:00.410 --> 02:42:02.091]  How does this tie together with the suit?
[02:42:02.111 --> 02:42:11.954]  This lawsuit was filed approximately a year ago in the Southern District of Florida in the Fort Lauderdale courthouse.
[02:42:13.674 --> 02:42:24.398]  Last week, after having a three and a half hour court hearing on defendants motion to dismiss the complaint
[02:42:25.563 --> 02:42:44.876]  For failure to state a claim, the federal judge dismissed the lawsuit filed by over 100 people for allegations of fraud against the Democratic National Committee and its former chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[02:42:48.518 --> 02:42:53.882]  The judge on this case is Judge William J. Zlock.
[02:42:57.401 --> 02:43:04.623]  By the way, Schultz is under criminal investigation now, and her adjuncts have been indicted for espionage, so we're really starting to dig deeper into all this.
[02:43:04.683 --> 02:43:20.607]  And I understand you're giving us just the facts and the background, but... Three months ago, on May 25th, 2017, the body of Mr. Branton Wisnant washed up on shore in Hollywood.
[02:43:22.247 --> 02:43:24.868]  Can you show that gas pump that I sent you?
[02:43:27.301 --> 02:43:28.542]  The picture of the gas pump?
[02:43:29.782 --> 02:43:32.564]  Yeah, we'll pull up some of those images, but just describe it for us.
[02:43:34.725 --> 02:43:38.266]  His body was found on Hollywood Beach.
[02:43:38.346 --> 02:43:40.467]  Hollywood Beach is in Florida.
[02:43:42.548 --> 02:43:44.009]  And I sent you guys a map.
[02:43:46.010 --> 02:43:56.675]  It is very, very close to the Southern District of Florida courthouse where the Wilding case was pending.
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:06.203]  A few weeks ago, I had a meeting with a gentleman by the name of George Webb.
[02:44:07.865 --> 02:44:14.189]  George Webb is a roving independent reporter for Crowdsource The Truth.
[02:44:16.050 --> 02:44:29.820]  After he interviewed my law partner, Jared Beck, and I regarding the DNC fraud lawsuit, we went out to dinner with his colleague, Jason Goodman.
[02:44:31.201 --> 02:44:39.505]  George Webb told me that it is very, very easy to induce heart attacks in people.
[02:44:41.806 --> 02:44:54.353]  Apparently, you can freeze toxins, heart attack-inducing toxins, into tiny little splinters and shoot them inside of people.
[02:44:56.374 --> 02:44:56.774]  And once
[02:44:57.958 --> 02:45:01.903]  The frozen toxin dart goes inside your body.
[02:45:02.083 --> 02:45:04.446]  It melts and releases the toxin.
[02:45:05.247 --> 02:45:08.892]  And soon thereafter, you will have a heart attack.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:16.987]  Sure, or it's gelatin darts, but just backing up because I know you've really been an expert on this, a lawyer involved in it all.
[02:45:17.308 --> 02:45:19.971]  We know that they stole the election from Sanders.
[02:45:20.011 --> 02:45:20.932]  The suit's been thrown out.
[02:45:21.192 --> 02:45:22.713]  We know a lot of judges are getting killed.
[02:45:23.034 --> 02:45:29.000]  They later admitted that Antonin Scalia was part of a secret society connected to Bohemian Grove at the event.
[02:45:30.011 --> 02:45:30.831]  A lot of weirdness.
[02:45:31.352 --> 02:45:36.955]  Clearly, I mean, they've got former CIA deputy directors saying they're going to kill Trump on television.
[02:45:37.315 --> 02:45:47.842]  So, Elizabeth Beck, I'm asking you just in the generalities about the cases while we had you on, dealing with Bernie Sanders, and just show it up for us, what you're saying this all points towards.
[02:45:48.962 --> 02:45:58.548]  What I'm saying is that whatever job we collectively want done is too big for one courthouse
[02:45:59.509 --> 02:46:04.012]  One judge, one lawyer, or one voter.
[02:46:04.032 --> 02:46:05.012]  Not true.
[02:46:06.253 --> 02:46:06.653]  Okay?
[02:46:08.634 --> 02:46:12.176]  So now, Judge Slock has dismissed the case.
[02:46:13.637 --> 02:46:16.779]  We are considering our options, including appeal.
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:27.385]  If we were to appeal this adverse ruling, it would go up to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, Federal Appeals.
[02:46:29.930 --> 02:46:37.380]  If they agree with the lower court, it would then presumably go up to the Supreme Court on a petition for certiorari.
[02:46:39.643 --> 02:46:43.528]  I think it would probably be a good idea for this lawsuit
[02:46:45.527 --> 02:46:55.012]  If more and more judges were on its side rather than it being handled by one lone federal judge sitting here in South Florida.
[02:46:55.112 --> 02:46:57.454]  Sure, but what's the statute of limitations?
[02:46:57.474 --> 02:47:09.140]  Can't folks that voted for Sanders and saw the majority vote given to Hillary as they did in like 12 states at least, can't they just file suits all over and then those have a better chance of something getting through?
[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:13.603]  There's over 1 million lawyers in this country.
[02:47:14.346 --> 02:47:30.317]  I invite the public to contact attorneys to see if they can assist you in filing your lawsuits against whatever grievances you may have against your local or federal government in connection with election irregularities.
[02:47:31.553 --> 02:47:33.934]  All right, well listen, Elizabeth Beck, thank you so much.
[02:47:34.054 --> 02:47:34.854]  Jampac.us.
[02:47:34.914 --> 02:47:39.556]  I want to talk to you again once you get honed down exactly where you think your next step is.
[02:47:39.596 --> 02:47:40.316]  Thank you so much.
[02:47:40.856 --> 02:47:53.141]  Now, getting into the other big news here, I mentioned this earlier today about the Islamicists and how they run a lot of the city councils, town councils as they call them in the
[02:47:55.103 --> 02:48:02.809]  UK and how I've had members of Parliament on who've broken down the fact even liberal MPs from the Labour Party
[02:48:03.789 --> 02:48:14.119]  How that's the business, is the men go to work, the women stay at home and are foster parents, and they're just giving them little Christian kids, even though there's other family, grandparents, you name it.
[02:48:14.739 --> 02:48:19.784]  And since I mentioned that big story that's in the Times of London, the social workers say it's horrible.
[02:48:19.804 --> 02:48:25.009]  They took her cross, you know, they're telling her she's going to hell reportedly because she's a Christian.
[02:48:26.450 --> 02:48:27.231]  Since I mentioned
[02:48:28.632 --> 02:48:37.613]  Now a lot of these towns, they've caught them grooming thousands of little girls, many times who are in foster care and then they're sold to sex slavery, which you can do under Islam because you're a subhuman, you're a demi.
[02:48:38.444 --> 02:48:45.369]  That's how ISIS could sell little girls into sex labor, have a hundred guys rape a little girl, you know, until her insides came out and died.
[02:48:45.809 --> 02:48:46.690]  I'm sorry to talk like that.
[02:48:46.710 --> 02:48:47.430]  That's just what happens.
[02:48:47.810 --> 02:48:51.053]  But with liberals, it's okay, because it's just kind of a cool, cool, cool liberal thing.
[02:48:51.333 --> 02:48:52.594]  You know, salons into pedophilia.
[02:48:52.614 --> 02:48:54.595]  I mean, they promote pedophilia, so why should they care?
[02:48:54.615 --> 02:48:56.296]  It's all just part of something deviant.
[02:48:56.336 --> 02:48:56.897]  It's sick.
[02:48:56.917 --> 02:49:03.521]  It's fun to, like, throw little Christian children, sons of the lions, just into, you know, burqa, jihad hells.
[02:49:04.582 --> 02:49:05.883]  But I thought I'd mention this.
[02:49:05.903 --> 02:49:06.943]  This is out of the Express.co.uk.
[02:49:08.942 --> 02:49:12.525]  Rotterham, abuse scandal, horrific reality of industrial scale.
[02:49:12.545 --> 02:49:13.446]  That's what the police said.
[02:49:13.626 --> 02:49:15.007]  Child grooming revealed.
[02:49:15.908 --> 02:49:18.490]  And it gets into all of it for you.
[02:49:19.271 --> 02:49:21.153]  And they're put on the street at age nine.
[02:49:22.173 --> 02:49:29.560]  And the Muslim men come and they just line up and they pay the local Muslim controller, the mayors, the Muslim police, you name it.
[02:49:29.620 --> 02:49:30.421]  And it's just how it is.
[02:49:31.244 --> 02:49:33.385]  Of course, I as a Christian can't go to Saudi Arabia.
[02:49:33.465 --> 02:49:34.465]  I can't go to any of these countries.
[02:49:34.785 --> 02:49:35.685]  I'd be attacked.
[02:49:35.745 --> 02:49:39.387]  I'd be killed if I got outside of my work zone, even though I was an oil field engineer.
[02:49:39.887 --> 02:49:42.248]  And I'm supposed to go, oh that's okay because I'm open.
[02:49:42.508 --> 02:49:47.949]  I have guilt that I've been an open, Western, free society compared to anybody else that we pioneered world freedom.
[02:49:48.289 --> 02:49:59.453]  So I'm going to feel guilty now and just say I'm going to just worship Merkel saying she's going to bring in even more refugees now and make whole towns only Muslim and pay for everything!
[02:50:02.281 --> 02:50:07.223]  And then it's Muslims feeding on Muslims and abusing them and throwing gays off buildings.
[02:50:07.443 --> 02:50:08.503]  That doesn't matter!
[02:50:09.223 --> 02:50:11.444]  Jihad, watch PayPal, ban them!
[02:50:13.785 --> 02:50:16.006]  The rebel media just got their website taken down.
[02:50:16.306 --> 02:50:17.786]  They're coming for everybody.
[02:50:17.846 --> 02:50:19.067]  That's owned by a Jewish guy.
[02:50:19.607 --> 02:50:24.029]  Muslim community absolutely disgusted by Newcastle grooming gang.
[02:50:24.809 --> 02:50:27.510]  Hey, foster kids, meet your new dad!
[02:50:29.891 --> 02:50:30.951]  Meet your new dad!
[02:50:33.783 --> 02:50:37.425]  Pakistani folks are great people, but did you know that 34%?
[02:50:38.626 --> 02:50:42.609]  They're less than 1% of the population in England.
[02:50:42.769 --> 02:50:46.351]  34% of the deformities in the hospitals are for the Pakistani folks.
[02:50:47.392 --> 02:50:53.555]  Mental disorders from inbreeding really has hit the British royalty as well, the Japanese royalty, the Egyptian royalty.
[02:50:53.896 --> 02:50:59.599]  It's really crippling and we have to really come to the understanding that with Islam, inbreeding is mandated.
[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:02.081]  That's why you've got so much mental illness in Islam.
[02:51:12.372 --> 02:51:13.838]  This memo will bring down the traitors.
[02:51:14.320 --> 02:51:17.873]  McMasters doesn't want you... Deep State doesn't want you to read this memo.
[02:51:19.358 --> 02:51:20.579]  I mean, talk about traitors.
[02:51:20.599 --> 02:51:25.020]  You've got McMaster granting Susan Rice her same level of security clearance.
[02:51:25.160 --> 02:51:29.382]  At the same time, Trump is actively saying, we need to find the leakers.
[02:51:29.742 --> 02:51:30.623]  I'm being surveilled.
[02:51:30.923 --> 02:51:31.743]  Oh no, you're not.
[02:51:31.783 --> 02:51:32.704]  That's a big lie.
[02:51:32.724 --> 02:51:33.864]  How are you going to lie to the people?
[02:51:33.964 --> 02:51:36.365]  No, they wiretapped Trump Tower.
[02:51:36.765 --> 02:51:44.068]  And so at the same time that Trump is saying this to the American people, McMaster is saying, I don't think Susan Rice did anything wrong.
[02:51:44.168 --> 02:51:47.670]  I'm going to allow her to still have her same level of security clearance.
[02:51:48.310 --> 02:51:49.291]  It's insane!
[02:51:49.411 --> 02:51:51.493]  Why are the neocons surrounding Trump?
[02:51:51.693 --> 02:51:52.554]  What do they have on him?
[02:51:52.694 --> 02:51:53.415]  What's happening?
[02:51:53.995 --> 02:52:04.204]  Well again, David admit in the memo, as I've said on air without the memo, the Bolsheviks, same globalist operatives, they created a state within a state for years and Russia only controlled Moscow.
[02:52:04.824 --> 02:52:09.325]  And then they got everybody through time to turn in their guns through propaganda, then they slaughtered millions of people.
[02:52:09.805 --> 02:52:12.585]  So they admit that it is a Maoist strategy.
[02:52:12.605 --> 02:52:14.006]  That's what the Weathermen taught Obama.
[02:52:14.266 --> 02:52:20.567]  They are all carrying out a Maoist strategy with deep staters and cowards like McMasters and others that Trump picked.
[02:52:20.627 --> 02:52:27.508]  They get approached by deep state, they get scared, and they join with it because they want to play golf and do whatever while we're being carted off to death camps.
[02:52:27.888 --> 02:52:31.549]  And pot-bellied liberals are kicking our brains out and raping our families, literally.
[02:52:31.949 --> 02:52:37.174]  That's what the left talks about, how they're going to rape us, how they're going to murder us, how they're going to have all these little nobodies.
[02:52:37.535 --> 02:52:41.759]  This is their existential dream of power, is to run around desiccating on everybody.
[02:52:43.652 --> 02:52:46.473]  Well, people need to look no further than Venezuela and what happened.
[02:52:46.493 --> 02:52:49.433]  That's the exact same thing that they did there just several years ago.
[02:52:49.534 --> 02:52:50.634]  They got rid of the guns.
[02:52:50.714 --> 02:52:53.515]  Everyone turn in your guns because we want to be a peaceful nation.
[02:52:54.195 --> 02:53:07.118]  And then just about a year or so later, we saw the total collapse there where the government was actually purging people who are eating dogs and giraffes out of the zoo, purging them because they don't have the guns or anything to fight back.
[02:53:08.835 --> 02:53:12.198]  Yeah, it only shows their hand even so more.
[02:53:12.218 --> 02:53:14.919]  The minute you start telling the truth, they try to slap you down.
[02:53:14.939 --> 02:53:19.523]  The minute they start sharing anything that has a headline that's anti-them, they try to ban it.
[02:53:19.783 --> 02:53:26.047]  They are going to be forcing their hand so much that they're showing us, they're exposing us what their actual plans are.
[02:53:26.347 --> 02:53:30.790]  They're trying to ban us, they're trying to shut us down, they're trying to fire people for speaking the truth.
[02:53:31.071 --> 02:53:33.152]  That's only going to mean that more people are going to hear it.
[02:53:33.172 --> 02:53:34.673]  We're not the radicals saying all this.
[02:53:34.713 --> 02:53:36.394]  They're on C-SPAN.
[02:53:37.415 --> 02:53:44.364]  At the Aspen Institute with Wolf Blitzer, Brennan, and Clapper saying a violent overthrow is coming in the next few months.
[02:53:44.684 --> 02:53:45.846]  Don't wait for impeachment.
[02:53:45.906 --> 02:53:46.887]  We're now moving.
[02:53:47.248 --> 02:53:49.771]  And then Al Gore goes on the Late Late Show and says the same thing.
[02:53:50.151 --> 02:53:51.633]  I mean, they are doing it!
[02:54:18.843 --> 02:54:20.244]  All right, this just in.
[02:54:21.564 --> 02:54:27.167]  You know, Joy Vila and a lot of those other great artists that are pro-Trump, their videos are being removed.
[02:54:27.707 --> 02:54:33.911]  They're being given cease and desist letters by YouTube to remove the video, Make America Great Again, and they've been demonetized.
[02:54:35.091 --> 02:54:36.812]  They are shutting down the rebel media.
[02:54:36.932 --> 02:54:39.253]  They are shutting down Jihad Watch.
[02:54:39.293 --> 02:54:40.894]  They are shutting down basically everybody.
[02:54:41.534 --> 02:54:43.675]  They've been deleting Paul Watson's videos for two weeks.
[02:54:43.715 --> 02:54:44.456]  He hasn't done one.
[02:54:44.936 --> 02:54:46.277]  He says he's looking for another platform.
[02:54:48.089 --> 02:54:51.870]  The censorship, it was 20 times, whatever it was, a couple months ago.
[02:54:51.890 --> 02:54:52.910]  Now it's 100 times.
[02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:56.651]  I mean, Trump needs to move with antitrust.
[02:54:57.351 --> 02:55:00.352]  He needs to move with hearings on Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[02:55:00.852 --> 02:55:01.872]  Massive discrimination.
[02:55:01.892 --> 02:55:03.293]  They're trying to take Twitter away from him.
[02:55:03.653 --> 02:55:04.853]  We're in a revolution.
[02:55:05.433 --> 02:55:11.115]  And these big combines, as Congressman Dana Rohrabacher has pointed out, we need to get him back on, are engaged in racketeering.
[02:55:12.635 --> 02:55:15.216]  And they're trying to block people from credit card companies, from PayPal.
[02:55:15.716 --> 02:55:16.076]  It's on.
[02:55:17.349 --> 02:55:19.514]  Meanwhile, Mother Jones made a huge joke.
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:24.184]  The socialist publication, the elite publication.
[02:55:26.028 --> 02:55:41.512]  About a little ad that Kit Daniels put up looking for interns, and in it we said, don't plagiarize, have good spelling, and then they put the deceptive headline up that InfoWars has the lowest job requirements we've ever seen.
[02:55:41.813 --> 02:55:43.453]  Well, I guess technically it's true.
[02:55:43.493 --> 02:55:53.476]  It is a job because we have paid internships, unlike Mother Jones, who has unpaid interns who qualified for food stamps, even though the directors of Mother Jones rake in millions.
[02:55:54.292 --> 02:55:55.573]  It's always the same.
[02:55:55.973 --> 02:55:58.174]  Alex Jones is looking for someone who can spell.
[02:56:00.374 --> 02:56:05.156]  And what they did was cherry pick just the area where we were talking about interns.
[02:56:05.777 --> 02:56:06.557]  And we're like, yeah.
[02:56:07.217 --> 02:56:08.598]  Has some journalistic background.
[02:56:08.918 --> 02:56:09.878]  Be a news junkie.
[02:56:11.519 --> 02:56:12.479]  Don't plagiarize.
[02:56:13.360 --> 02:56:15.641]  And, you know, have good grammar and spelling.
[02:56:16.521 --> 02:56:20.963]  But the funny is you go to their ad and it's similar to ours saying be a news junkie.
[02:56:22.443 --> 02:56:30.910]  It's just weird how they take everything and misrepresent it just at every little level.
[02:56:30.970 --> 02:56:33.612]  It's just sniping and watching everything we do.
[02:56:33.712 --> 02:56:34.293]  And why is it?
[02:56:34.553 --> 02:56:37.035]  Because we know their game plan.
[02:56:38.256 --> 02:56:39.997]  They know they're a ruling class.
[02:56:40.097 --> 02:56:41.899]  They know they're social engineering.
[02:56:42.139 --> 02:56:43.380]  They know they're getting rich.
[02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:46.983]  They know these charities at the top, they get tens of millions of dollars apiece.
[02:56:48.530 --> 02:56:50.671]  Like the young Turks who act like they're doing it for free.
[02:56:51.111 --> 02:56:55.053]  And the guy's one of the highest paid people in media.
[02:56:55.093 --> 02:56:56.553]  The thing is, it's okay if he's making money.
[02:56:56.813 --> 02:57:01.435]  Just don't sit there and beg for money and do all this while you get $20 million from Hillary and the DNC.
[02:57:02.055 --> 02:57:06.477]  Or sit here and be mad at us that we have paid internships, when your people, yeah, food stamps!
[02:57:06.857 --> 02:57:07.478]  Yeah!
[02:57:07.778 --> 02:57:09.798]  Get some Space Cadet and do it for free!
[02:57:12.820 --> 02:57:13.420]  It's amazing.
[02:57:15.171 --> 02:57:18.574]  Absolutely incredible that they operate like this.
[02:57:21.557 --> 02:57:27.923]  Now before I go any further, speaking of support, we're not funded by the globalists, we're funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[02:57:28.804 --> 02:57:34.209]  And we've got Super Mel Vitale, the amazing cold press, known herbs, cold press is a key term.
[02:57:35.811 --> 02:57:38.793]  We've got that, ladies and gentlemen, for an
[02:57:40.478 --> 02:57:41.659]  We're good to go.
[02:58:01.274 --> 02:58:08.137]  From Nature's Brands, but that it's 50% off Emmerich's Essentials today.
[02:58:08.157 --> 02:58:17.521]  50% off Emmerich's Essentials today at Infowarslife.com or by calling AAA253-3139.
[02:58:18.761 --> 02:58:21.082]  A great way for you to get these great organic products.
[02:58:21.542 --> 02:58:25.024]  And I can't really say support the broadcast because the prices are already so low.
[02:58:25.044 --> 02:58:27.605]  The 50% off is basically a loss later.
[02:58:27.625 --> 02:58:30.206]  By the time we ship it and pay folks, we're not making any money on that.
[02:58:30.726 --> 02:58:31.807]  It's a great way for people to try it.
[02:58:31.867 --> 02:58:34.550]  The Total Hygiene Pack, the Starter Pack, the Outdoor Pack.
[02:58:34.570 --> 02:58:41.057]  But the big thing is getting on the journey of saying no to the big chemical brands and getting high-quality, organic, healthy stuff that works a lot better.
[02:58:41.477 --> 02:58:43.259]  We sell the exact same stuff sold at Whole Foods.
[02:58:43.519 --> 02:58:50.326]  They've run ads, though, in the news saying I'm a scammer for selling some of the top... I can't even sell toothpaste without them saying I'm evil.
[02:58:50.346 --> 02:58:50.727]  But you know what?
[02:58:50.747 --> 02:58:51.608]  We know they're all frauds.
[02:58:54.218 --> 02:58:58.601]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:58:58.702 --> 02:59:09.650]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:59:09.790 --> 02:59:14.732]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:59:14.852 --> 02:59:17.353]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:59:17.413 --> 02:59:18.914]  It helps detoxify.
[02:59:19.134 --> 02:59:21.955]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:59:22.015 --> 02:59:26.757]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:59:26.777 --> 02:59:33.019]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:59:33.059 --> 02:59:38.362]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:59:38.382 --> 02:59:39.142]  I'm taking it now.
[02:59:39.482 --> 02:59:43.326]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:11.445 --> 03:00:16.448]  And now, live from London, England, it's your host, Paul Joseph Watson!
[03:00:16.548 --> 03:00:20.230]  ...mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:20.250 --> 03:00:21.691]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:21.911 --> 03:00:23.091]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:23.612 --> 03:00:28.174]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.394 --> 03:00:38.220]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, Bezos the Slave Master, they have really jumped the shark in a big way, or jumped the megalodon, as I like to say.
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:42.162]  By trying to just openly censor conservatives, libertarians, you name it.
[03:00:42.663 --> 03:00:51.609]  SPLC's getting sued up one side and down the other by giant, you know, Christian organizations like the Kennedy Center, great people over there.
[03:00:52.430 --> 03:00:54.091]  The Family Research Council, great people.
[03:00:55.089 --> 03:00:59.951]  I mean, they want a war, they're getting one, but massive censorship across the board.
[03:00:59.991 --> 03:01:10.634]  I'm going to turn the baton over to Paul Joseph Watson to get into censorship and all of the big news, but what about the practice you've been talking about where these councils, these city councils
[03:01:11.374 --> 03:01:12.215]  The Muslims run it.
[03:01:12.235 --> 03:01:12.795]  I mean, they do.
[03:01:13.356 --> 03:01:14.237]  It's Muslim gangs.
[03:01:14.297 --> 03:01:15.317]  Muslim Mafia exists.
[03:01:15.598 --> 03:01:18.040]  And they give the children as foster care to other Muslims.
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:23.184]  Little Christian kids, little five-year-olds, have their crosses taken, are told they're going to hell because they're Christian.
[03:01:23.204 --> 03:01:28.969]  You know, they now live in a family with burkas that don't speak English so that the city can pay money.
[03:01:29.189 --> 03:01:30.971]  And the mayor's even busted doing it.
[03:01:31.351 --> 03:01:33.373]  And even the social workers are saying it's wrong.
[03:01:33.633 --> 03:01:39.398]  But they don't care because, under political correctness, we've got to give our Christian children to families with burkas!
[03:01:41.502 --> 03:01:42.043]  No, exactly.
[03:01:42.103 --> 03:01:48.529]  Now it's come out, Alex, that the parents of this girl begged the council to allow her to stay with her grandmother.
[03:01:48.569 --> 03:01:50.071]  So we're hearing even more about this.
[03:01:50.411 --> 03:01:55.797]  Remember back a few years ago, there was a UKIP supporting foster couple parents.
[03:01:55.997 --> 03:01:59.461]  Exemplary record in terms of foster parenting of children.
[03:02:00.642 --> 03:02:05.846]  They took in, I think it was actually probably a Pakistani child, it was a non-white child anyway.
[03:02:06.426 --> 03:02:09.949]  Again, perfect record of being adoptive parents.
[03:02:10.349 --> 03:02:15.674]  Because they supported UKIP, which in 2015 was what, the third biggest party in Britain?
[03:02:15.954 --> 03:02:19.697]  Because they supported UKIP, they had those children taken away!
[03:02:20.467 --> 03:02:25.894]  So if you support UKIP, if you support one of the major UK political parties, you can't adopt children.
[03:02:26.195 --> 03:02:37.951]  But if you're a burka-wearing, Arabic-speaking, Al-Akbar-chanting Muslim, then they'll just take little five-year-old Christian girls and hand them over, and if you disagree with it, you're Islamophobic.
[03:02:38.191 --> 03:02:39.312]  This is a perversion.
[03:02:39.592 --> 03:02:42.856]  The left loves attacking Christians, attacking children.
[03:02:42.876 --> 03:02:44.377]  They're all into promoting pedophilia.
[03:02:44.898 --> 03:02:58.491]  And this is a great cuckolding to feed our children into the burqa machines, to feed them into the jihad nest, and to heap the welfare and all the free goodies on the Muslims so they can just walk around ruling everyone.
[03:02:59.864 --> 03:03:07.170]  No, I mean, that's why they've aligned with Islam, Alex, because they both support the fundamental concept of overthrowing Western civilization.
[03:03:07.230 --> 03:03:08.011]  It's that simple.
[03:03:08.491 --> 03:03:21.822]  Over in Sweden, of course, homeschooling is basically illegal, Alex, but unless you're an ISIS jihadist who's returning from Syria to Sweden, then you're allowed to look after children, then you're allowed to homeschool them.
[03:03:22.002 --> 03:03:28.127]  So you only get special rights in Sweden if you're actually an ISIS terrorist, because that's politically correct.
[03:03:29.138 --> 03:03:44.284]  And we're not kidding, special rights, special rights to the most horribly oppressive, pre-Stone Age, crazy people that cut women's genitals off, and journalists are getting six months suspended sentences for pointing out that Islam aligned with Hitler in World War II.
[03:03:45.939 --> 03:03:46.460]  No, exactly.
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:47.661]  We had that story as well.
[03:03:47.781 --> 03:03:58.090]  We've got somebody who's a friend of a friend of mine in Edinburgh who made fun of ISIS, mocked ISIS and was called Islamophobic, is now under investigation.
[03:03:58.510 --> 03:04:03.395]  By the way, they've gone quiet since we reported on it, but a lot of these cases don't even get the light of attention.
[03:04:03.995 --> 03:04:15.564]  Alex, we've got a case over in Sweden where a court refused to deport a migrant who raped a mentally disabled child because he'd had a hard time in Afghanistan before he got to Sweden.
[03:04:15.824 --> 03:04:17.545]  So poor baby, let's be nice to him.
[03:04:18.746 --> 03:04:21.108]  And these are real cases, they do this with a straight face.
[03:04:21.448 --> 03:04:25.271]  And the plan is, if they can make us submit to Islam, they can make us submit to anything.
[03:04:25.471 --> 03:04:29.774]  And that's your Michael Moore article, where he said white people are inherently evil, get rid of them.
[03:04:31.337 --> 03:04:31.897]  No, exactly.
[03:04:31.937 --> 03:04:34.679]  And this is par for the course with Michael Moore, of course.
[03:04:35.260 --> 03:04:38.322]  For years, he built his reputation on being this man of the people.
[03:04:38.662 --> 03:04:42.064]  Now he comes out and just says, oh, all Trump voters are rapists.
[03:04:42.144 --> 03:04:44.806]  He actually got up on CNN and suggested that.
[03:04:45.266 --> 03:04:47.048]  And now, basically, they're all deplorables.
[03:04:47.068 --> 03:04:47.668]  They're all racist.
[03:04:47.688 --> 03:04:48.148]  You know what?
[03:04:48.468 --> 03:04:50.270]  I said I'm getting out of here, but I can't help it.
[03:04:50.310 --> 03:04:52.431]  I want to come back with one final comment on Michael Moore.
[03:04:52.491 --> 03:04:55.913]  I want to define, and that photo you used is so perfect.
[03:04:55.933 --> 03:05:00.016]  In person, he looks like the creepiest pervert you've ever seen.
[03:05:00.036 --> 03:05:01.217]  I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[03:05:01.638 --> 03:05:02.441]  He just looks like one.
[03:05:09.161 --> 03:05:15.766]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[03:05:15.986 --> 03:05:18.388]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[03:05:18.548 --> 03:05:21.850]  Not in the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[03:05:21.991 --> 03:05:24.152]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[03:05:24.192 --> 03:05:28.856]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[03:05:29.036 --> 03:05:31.798]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[03:05:31.898 --> 03:05:36.121]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[03:05:39.003 --> 03:05:39.844]  Unprecedented.
[03:05:39.924 --> 03:05:40.984]  And it's cold-pressed.
[03:05:41.124 --> 03:05:43.046]  That's why Super Mayo is so different.
[03:05:43.066 --> 03:05:49.349]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are other... What you sell, they BuzzFeed said, is like, is already best-selling stuff.
[03:05:49.409 --> 03:05:51.410]  It's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[03:05:51.470 --> 03:05:52.651]  Why these aren't anything new?
[03:05:52.691 --> 03:05:56.694]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[03:05:56.714 --> 03:05:56.774]  Duh!
[03:05:56.954 --> 03:05:57.314]  Duh!
[03:06:04.048 --> 03:06:13.060]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:06:13.140 --> 03:06:21.331]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:06:21.531 --> 03:06:26.234]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:06:26.414 --> 03:06:33.119]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:33.199 --> 03:06:40.284]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:06:40.384 --> 03:06:47.249]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:06:47.389 --> 03:06:51.752]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:06:51.873 --> 03:06:55.135]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:06:55.275 --> 03:07:01.400]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:03.241]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:03.882 --> 03:07:12.524]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[03:07:12.584 --> 03:07:13.064]  That's right.
[03:07:13.124 --> 03:07:18.125]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[03:07:18.385 --> 03:07:24.866]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[03:07:25.066 --> 03:07:32.308]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[03:07:32.688 --> 03:07:32.828]  Woo!
[03:07:32.888 --> 03:07:33.809]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:07:33.929 --> 03:07:42.514]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:07:42.654 --> 03:07:51.900]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:55.582]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:07:55.702 --> 03:07:59.644]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:07:59.804 --> 03:08:00.665]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:08:00.885 --> 03:08:03.506]  Check it out right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:08:06.148 --> 03:08:10.050]  For the last two years, I've been saying there's an attack on white people in America.
[03:08:10.390 --> 03:08:14.372]  If you go out and you say you're a Trump supporter today, you're automatically racist.
[03:08:14.452 --> 03:08:14.632]  Why?
[03:08:14.672 --> 03:08:15.393]  Because you're white.
[03:08:15.493 --> 03:08:17.514]  Right now, the war is the Infowar.
[03:08:18.294 --> 03:08:19.715]  That's the war that we're in right now.
[03:08:34.316 --> 03:08:34.676]  I'm 1776.
[03:08:34.716 --> 03:08:36.717]  You're a white man!
[03:08:37.338 --> 03:08:41.762]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:08:42.622 --> 03:08:43.523]  Move, bitch!
[03:08:43.843 --> 03:08:44.944]  Get out the way!
[03:08:46.705 --> 03:08:50.248]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag...
[03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:52.669]  It's the American flag!
[03:08:52.869 --> 03:08:57.211]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:08:57.231 --> 03:09:00.671]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:09:00.791 --> 03:09:02.192]  I will not let you down.
[03:09:02.252 --> 03:09:05.173]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:09:05.393 --> 03:09:06.853]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:09:06.933 --> 03:09:09.014]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:09:09.114 --> 03:09:14.775]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:09:14.815 --> 03:09:16.815]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:09:17.356 --> 03:09:18.356]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:09:20.472 --> 03:09:23.733]  By the way, if you just saw that intro, I don't know the man's name.
[03:09:23.753 --> 03:09:28.734]  I want to call him a black man or a white man, just a man's name from out in San Francisco.
[03:09:28.754 --> 03:09:33.775]  But I saw a bunch of speeches he gave in videos, and I want that guy to be a commentator with us.
[03:09:33.815 --> 03:09:42.237]  Just get on, better speaker than I am, and just boils it all down, saying, look, there are attacks on white people, and it's being directed politically, and it's wrong.
[03:09:44.051 --> 03:09:46.434]  White people were politically directing attacks on black people.
[03:09:46.514 --> 03:09:48.657]  It's just Martin Luther King would say it was wrong.
[03:09:48.797 --> 03:09:49.718]  I would say it's wrong.
[03:09:50.338 --> 03:09:53.322]  You're supposed to judge somebody off the character of what they do.
[03:09:54.103 --> 03:09:55.324]  That's totally common sense.
[03:09:55.344 --> 03:09:56.446]  That's totally libertarian.
[03:09:57.793 --> 03:10:25.251]  But they've gone now from saying, oh, Trump caters to racists, to Trump is a racist, and all of his supporters are KKK, are white supremacists, and then I watched the footage of Berkeley, of San Francisco, I mean, I mean, chasing down prayer meeting people, and beating the hell out of them, and spitting in their faces, and then Pelosi in the news, CBS News, people there going, well, they're Nazis, and I'm scared of Nazis, so I want them to be scared!
[03:10:26.305 --> 03:10:27.726]  They're not Nazis, you idiot!
[03:10:28.927 --> 03:10:31.168]  Now you're going to make some Nazis with that kind of behavior.
[03:10:32.329 --> 03:10:41.855]  It's just incredible and it freaks you out to know people are this dumbed down, but since we mention it, let's put back on screen, we're getting Paul back on Skype, he's back now.
[03:10:42.655 --> 03:10:44.096]  Let's, so it's good I hung around here.
[03:10:44.696 --> 03:10:47.118]  Great, great technology, but somebody's got his hiccups, he's in London, England.
[03:10:47.538 --> 03:10:50.060]  Let's punch up Michael Moore and the article that Paul wrote.
[03:10:50.896 --> 03:10:55.018]  Where he gives this interview and says, I can't wait till white people are the minority.
[03:10:55.078 --> 03:10:56.238]  I can't wait for that day to happen.
[03:10:56.859 --> 03:11:00.220]  That's inherently saying whites as a group are bad.
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:05.843]  That's like Hitler saying Jews as a group inherently have bad traits.
[03:11:08.344 --> 03:11:15.587]  That is totally tribal, completely racist, and it's Michael Moore that started out
[03:11:16.795 --> 03:11:37.280]  On PBS and stuff, and Roger and me going and showing deindustrialization pre-NAFTA and GATT, and then he totally sold out on NAFTA and GATT and globalism and everything else, and now hates Trump, the blue-collar billionaire, bringing people together, getting awards from the NAACP for hiring and putting blacks in management, and women, you name it, who do a good job.
[03:11:37.980 --> 03:11:41.540]  He's just like me, I don't care what color you are, you do a good job, I'll put you in position, whatever.
[03:11:42.181 --> 03:11:43.361]  The point is, is that
[03:11:44.318 --> 03:11:49.382]  Here he is now, this total race pimp, made hundreds of millions of dollars, has six armed bodyguards.
[03:11:49.622 --> 03:11:50.583]  Let's put him back on screen.
[03:11:50.963 --> 03:11:54.206]  And boy, he's got a face of somebody you'd like to hire to be your kid's babysitter, wouldn't you?
[03:11:54.887 --> 03:11:58.009]  I've seen him in person, just a creepy, evil, like a big, fat witch.
[03:11:58.350 --> 03:12:02.373]  You know that witch that Bugs Bunny's always fighting with, and ee-hee-hee-hee-hee, runs around?
[03:12:02.393 --> 03:12:03.494]  But let's forget how he looks.
[03:12:04.943 --> 03:12:05.804]  Let's forget how he looks.
[03:12:05.844 --> 03:12:10.589]  This is a creepy social engineer that knows he's manipulating society.
[03:12:10.630 --> 03:12:15.655]  You know on Morning Joe and all these shows where they say all Trump supporters are secretly racist.
[03:12:16.276 --> 03:12:23.744]  That's telling minorities you can't be pro-America, pro-gun, pro-low taxes, pro-sovereignty, take care of the veterans.
[03:12:23.785 --> 03:12:24.205]  No, no, no.
[03:12:24.285 --> 03:12:25.426]  None of you have any unity.
[03:12:26.716 --> 03:12:30.637]  Everybody's fighting with each other and whites are inherently bad and are the problem in the world.
[03:12:30.857 --> 03:12:34.898]  Well, why is everybody trying to get to Europe and the United States and Australia?
[03:12:35.958 --> 03:12:39.479]  Because they're Christian countries and that's the secret.
[03:12:39.799 --> 03:12:52.322]  You can take and studies in Africa, an African tribe that's Christian, same genetic background, haven't only been Christian 200 years, next to another tribe, same genetics across the river and
[03:12:53.880 --> 03:12:55.101]  Where do the airports get built?
[03:12:55.161 --> 03:12:56.081]  Where are the big houses?
[03:12:56.121 --> 03:12:56.961]  Where are the medicine?
[03:12:57.282 --> 03:12:58.142]  Where is the everything?
[03:12:58.182 --> 03:12:58.962]  It's the Christian area.
[03:12:59.703 --> 03:13:08.387]  So, you can argue different, you know, types of genetics, different groups, whatever, and different propensities of this or that, but certainly are there to a certain extent, in the average.
[03:13:09.307 --> 03:13:10.628]  But, it's Christianity.
[03:13:11.288 --> 03:13:20.272]  Not the fake glitterbug Christianity, not the name it and claim it Christianity, but folks building hospitals, people going and working hard, treating people like they want to be treated, believing in something bigger.
[03:13:22.466 --> 03:13:23.546]  Believe it in Jesus Christ.
[03:13:23.586 --> 03:13:26.548]  And that's why Christianity is under such incredible attack.
[03:13:26.628 --> 03:13:35.051]  And it's Christianity that re-flowered in the Renaissance and gave open free societies and let you not be Christian if you didn't want to.
[03:13:35.071 --> 03:13:37.332]  Because real Christianity said it's free will.
[03:13:37.932 --> 03:13:39.093]  So we got out of a fake
[03:13:39.853 --> 03:13:47.277]  Twisted false orthodoxy of Christianity in the dark ages and got true Christianity that brought us into this whole new world.
[03:13:47.557 --> 03:13:52.139]  The problem is the same old evils were there and now have grown out of control.
[03:13:52.599 --> 03:13:55.821]  So I want to ask Paul Watson and give him the balance of the transmission here.
[03:13:55.841 --> 03:14:06.986]  I want to ask Paul Watson if we play this clip of where he thinks we are in this battle and where we go and what we do and who he thinks we should sue because I've got damages from all these groups.
[03:14:08.151 --> 03:14:09.294]  But is it Tom Brokaw?
[03:14:09.514 --> 03:14:11.739]  Is it these other groups that have refused us service?
[03:14:13.122 --> 03:14:15.167]  Using the SPLC database, what do we do?
[03:14:15.207 --> 03:14:15.929]  But here is...
[03:14:17.259 --> 03:14:17.639]  A clip.
[03:14:17.719 --> 03:14:21.463]  Black Lives Matter founder claims Trump is trying to commit Hitler-like genocide.
[03:14:21.503 --> 03:14:26.427]  So, we've got universities saying, we don't want veterans now at major universities.
[03:14:26.447 --> 03:14:27.228]  Shouldn't be allowed to go.
[03:14:27.468 --> 03:14:28.829]  That's the new anti-fod demands.
[03:14:29.109 --> 03:14:31.111]  And they're shutting down universities and they're capitulating.
[03:14:31.792 --> 03:14:34.494]  Social justice warriors want universities to ban veterans.
[03:14:34.514 --> 03:14:35.115]  That's the headline.
[03:14:35.515 --> 03:14:38.418]  We've got them taking down Martin Luther King because he was a racist, they're now saying.
[03:14:38.638 --> 03:14:40.800]  I'm not kidding because he didn't mention gay people.
[03:14:40.820 --> 03:14:41.821]  Well, I guess he didn't mention
[03:14:42.481 --> 03:14:44.026]  You know, Malaysians either.
[03:14:44.066 --> 03:14:44.869]  It's just crazy.
[03:14:44.889 --> 03:14:46.493]  By omission, you're now bad.
[03:14:46.995 --> 03:14:47.657]  Total bullying.
[03:14:48.902 --> 03:14:51.563]  We've got all this happening, and they're just steamrolling ahead.
[03:14:51.943 --> 03:14:52.683]  What do we do?
[03:14:52.723 --> 03:14:54.343]  We certainly don't give in to the intimidation.
[03:14:55.363 --> 03:14:56.704]  But they think we're going to.
[03:14:57.024 --> 03:14:58.004]  It's crazy.
[03:14:58.964 --> 03:15:00.644]  So it's a collective insanity.
[03:15:00.664 --> 03:15:01.204]  But here it is.
[03:15:02.405 --> 03:15:12.247]  U of Nebraska threatens to call cops, and they come, a conservative student, at a public event for their own table, saying you're conservative, that's not allowed, you've got to go.
[03:15:12.267 --> 03:15:12.807]  That's coming up.
[03:15:12.827 --> 03:15:14.387]  But first, Black Lives Matter founder
[03:15:14.727 --> 03:15:18.631]  We wouldn't as a movement take a seat at the table with Trump because we wouldn't have done that with Hitler.
[03:15:39.364 --> 03:15:44.547]  Trump is literally the epitome of evil.
[03:15:45.208 --> 03:15:51.872]  All the evils of this country, be it racism, capitalism, sexism, homophobia.
[03:15:52.612 --> 03:15:59.857]  And he has set out some of the most dangerous policies, not just that impacts this country, but impacts the globe.
[03:16:00.337 --> 03:16:08.062]  And so for us, the answer is not to sit with Trump, but to resist him and to resist every single policy that he's
[03:16:08.642 --> 03:16:09.683]  We're good to go.
[03:16:28.132 --> 03:16:30.754]  Literally tried to kill your communities by bringing jobs to them.
[03:16:30.774 --> 03:16:33.115]  This is a truly sickening person.
[03:16:33.616 --> 03:16:36.258]  Black unemployment doubled under Obama, right at doubled.
[03:16:37.739 --> 03:16:41.321]  You read the WikiLeaks, they say, we're losing, the people are coming together, what do we do at the DNC?
[03:16:41.661 --> 03:16:43.122]  And they say, demographic warfare.
[03:16:43.162 --> 03:16:44.063]  That means race warfare.
[03:16:45.928 --> 03:16:55.411]  So, and then you just take some arrogant, racist, anti-you-name-it person like her, shovel her up there, hold her up, have the L.A.
[03:16:55.451 --> 03:17:02.673]  Times interview her like she's this oracle of wisdom that's never done anything in her life, but get funded by George Soros, like Linda Sorcerer.
[03:17:02.693 --> 03:17:06.995]  We're supposed to bow down to her authoritarian, racist inclinations.
[03:17:07.055 --> 03:17:08.295]  What a sick divider.
[03:17:08.815 --> 03:17:10.536]  Then I got one more clip, then Paul's taking over.
[03:17:11.016 --> 03:17:12.956]  This is, again, and the police came.
[03:17:12.976 --> 03:17:14.677]  They were not allowed, students are not allowed
[03:17:16.069 --> 03:17:17.070]  To have free speech.
[03:17:18.211 --> 03:17:20.934]  And again, people at Berkeley being beat up just for being at a prayer meeting.
[03:17:21.575 --> 03:17:22.876]  Everyone is to be attacked.
[03:17:23.456 --> 03:17:30.463]  And then you got all these white allies who are the most vicious, who want to attack whites to show they understand the inherent evil of white people.
[03:17:30.483 --> 03:17:30.744]  Here it is.
[03:17:32.570 --> 03:17:35.653]  When you make a statement, what is big in government?
[03:17:35.753 --> 03:17:37.654]  And it sucks.
[03:17:37.794 --> 03:17:38.415]  Does it suck?
[03:17:38.435 --> 03:17:42.238]  I'm going to have to ask you guys to move this to the free speech zone or we'll have to have you and OPD remove you.
[03:17:42.258 --> 03:17:43.178]  It's completely up to you.
[03:17:43.279 --> 03:17:45.000]  But isn't this a public university?
[03:17:45.020 --> 03:17:46.661]  This is not with propaganda.
[03:17:46.681 --> 03:17:49.223]  You can free speech all you want, but you cannot hand out propaganda.
[03:17:49.383 --> 03:17:51.085]  But isn't this a public university?
[03:17:51.125 --> 03:17:51.405]  It is.
[03:17:52.566 --> 03:17:55.388]  But this is a reservable area that requires a reservation.
[03:17:55.408 --> 03:17:56.208]  I've asked you once.
[03:17:57.149 --> 03:17:59.010]  If I have to ask you again, I'm going to have to call you an LPD.
[03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.610]  It's up to you.
[03:18:00.010 --> 03:18:01.611]  Where is the free speech zone?
[03:18:01.831 --> 03:18:04.873]  Free speech zone is over here on the other side of the Memorial Plaza signs.
[03:18:04.993 --> 03:18:06.534]  What is she doing that violates free speech?
[03:18:08.234 --> 03:18:10.816]  This is a reservable space that requires a reservation.
[03:18:11.176 --> 03:18:11.896]  We don't have one.
[03:18:12.016 --> 03:18:12.897]  But I'm not inside.
[03:18:12.997 --> 03:18:14.517]  I'm on the public property.
[03:18:14.617 --> 03:18:15.618]  It's everywhere from home.
[03:18:15.638 --> 03:18:16.939]  So the Constitution doesn't hold.
[03:18:17.119 --> 03:18:18.579]  From the two signs, okay?
[03:18:18.599 --> 03:18:22.761]  So if you're on the other side of the two signs, you've got free speech zone is specifically over here between the sign.
[03:18:22.781 --> 03:18:23.862]  Is this a public university?
[03:18:23.882 --> 03:18:24.722]  Canfield, yes it is.
[03:18:24.902 --> 03:18:25.843]  So then, right?
[03:18:26.743 --> 03:18:28.364]  See, it's propaganda because it had mild statements.
[03:18:55.988 --> 03:18:57.389]  Uh, about free speech.
[03:18:58.109 --> 03:19:01.151]  Uh, Paul, we're gonna skip both network breaks so you get your time back here.
[03:19:01.451 --> 03:19:04.492]  Last six, eight minutes where I've been taking over while you've been getting your Skype reconnected.
[03:19:05.133 --> 03:19:06.413]  Uh, what do you make of these people?
[03:19:06.433 --> 03:19:08.274]  They're just openly authoritarian now.
[03:19:08.574 --> 03:19:10.155]  The censorship's all quadrupled.
[03:19:10.875 --> 03:19:12.376]  Uh, it's total race war narrative.
[03:19:12.416 --> 03:19:14.137]  We know it's in the WikiLeaks, that's their plan.
[03:19:14.397 --> 03:19:15.938]  Good God, where is this going?
[03:19:18.444 --> 03:19:20.685]  Well, I mean, it's mass hysteria, Alex.
[03:19:20.725 --> 03:19:22.065]  That's what's been legitimised.
[03:19:22.125 --> 03:19:31.229]  And what happens with mass hysteria, and top professors have come out and said this, is that it leads to, ironically, right-wing authoritarianism.
[03:19:31.589 --> 03:19:36.691]  So while they wail and gnash their teeth about Trump being a fascist, their very actions
[03:19:37.151 --> 03:19:42.416]  We'll bring into being actual fascism because the people will revolt against this.
[03:19:42.456 --> 03:19:48.082]  They will freak out about this hysteria and they will vote in actual right-wing authoritarianism.
[03:19:48.442 --> 03:19:51.145]  So they're going mental about it now.
[03:19:51.205 --> 03:19:58.673]  They'll actually get it in reality simply as a consequence of their mass hysteria and how it's been legitimized by the media.
[03:19:59.491 --> 03:20:01.673]  And some people think that's some super secret plan.
[03:20:01.713 --> 03:20:02.133]  It's not.
[03:20:02.213 --> 03:20:03.595]  I know some of the highest levels of this.
[03:20:03.935 --> 03:20:11.621]  They're like insane mental patients, even at the top, who really want to conquer reality and conquer the family and conquer Christians.
[03:20:11.962 --> 03:20:22.871]  Why is it at its heart, I know you agree because it's true, this obsession with destroying Christianity by taking it over, by watering it down, by twisting it, turning it into Joel Olsteen.
[03:20:22.931 --> 03:20:23.972]  I mean, what is going on here?
[03:20:25.458 --> 03:20:33.882]  Well, I mean, it's the essence of postmodernism, Alex, is to not only change the system, to completely eviscerate and destroy everything that went before.
[03:20:34.362 --> 03:20:36.183]  And this came out of the French philosophers.
[03:20:36.443 --> 03:20:38.104]  It came out of the cultural Marxists.
[03:20:38.564 --> 03:20:40.745]  Now it's taking root in universities.
[03:20:40.825 --> 03:20:45.907]  Now the media, having embraced and endorsed Antifa, is legitimizing it.
[03:20:46.327 --> 03:20:48.349]  So now they're coming out in the open.
[03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:52.071]  Before it was, oh, we're just for LGBT rights, we're for minority rights.
[03:20:52.131 --> 03:20:53.432]  No, they don't care about that.
[03:20:53.652 --> 03:20:59.217]  OK, since Black Lives Matter came into being, there's more racism, there's more dead black people.
[03:20:59.417 --> 03:21:01.058]  They don't care about minorities.
[03:21:01.278 --> 03:21:03.740]  They care about power, raw power.
[03:21:03.980 --> 03:21:04.881]  That's what it's all about.
[03:21:04.941 --> 03:21:12.106]  It's about fundamentally upsetting, turning over society, remaking it in their own hysterical, warped image.
[03:21:12.466 --> 03:21:19.632]  And they're so power-trippy, and they're also so mob-driven, the Republican leadership as well, they're so cowardly.
[03:21:19.732 --> 03:21:22.875]  Don't they get, historically, but also in current context?
[03:21:24.176 --> 03:21:27.639]  Like you said, I'm worried about the super-wave coming back against this.
[03:21:28.059 --> 03:21:30.321]  I mean, people are pulling out of the globalist system.
[03:21:30.742 --> 03:21:33.444]  They are not giving their money to anything that's establishment now.
[03:21:33.964 --> 03:21:37.948]  Everyone I know, including most, quote, minorities, completely see through this.
[03:21:39.881 --> 03:21:44.325]  No, well, I mean, the positive aspect, Alex, is we were talking about Michael Moore earlier.
[03:21:44.766 --> 03:21:58.939]  There was an article out today which I commented on on Twitter and on Infowars.com, which is the VMAs, the MTV Video Music Awards, which, of course, now are basically 50% of the time it's lame anti-Trump hysterical virtue signalling.
[03:21:59.199 --> 03:22:03.440]  The other 50% is trash culture that doesn't fill anybody's hole.
[03:22:03.500 --> 03:22:04.921]  The youth are completely empty.
[03:22:04.961 --> 03:22:06.701]  They're searching for meaning in anything.
[03:22:06.741 --> 03:22:08.502]  They're not getting it out of popular culture.
[03:22:08.922 --> 03:22:13.543]  Their viewership, Alex, has halved just over the last three years.
[03:22:13.623 --> 03:22:17.604]  The MTV VMA Music Awards, they've lost half of their viewership.
[03:22:17.964 --> 03:22:25.207]  And they're panicking, then trying to shut us up, but no matter... And let's not brag, but you and I, well you quit doing videos in protest last few weeks.
[03:22:25.687 --> 03:22:31.169]  We've had videos, conservatively, even with their censorship, the last week, 20 million views.
[03:22:32.009 --> 03:22:33.950]  We're on syndicated radio, 200 stations.
[03:22:34.210 --> 03:22:35.491]  We have millions on our own streams.
[03:22:35.791 --> 03:22:40.252]  Hundreds of thousands on... 20 million views despite all their censorship.
[03:22:41.273 --> 03:22:44.714]  I mean their stupid MTV award, what, might get a couple million watching it?
[03:22:46.471 --> 03:22:48.694]  No, that's exactly it, and it's sinking fast.
[03:22:49.034 --> 03:23:04.612]  The thing about the YouTube censorship is we're probably to blame for it, Alex, because about six weeks ago, before they came out with this new level of censorship, which they say from Thursday onwards, although they're already initiating it, they're going to ban offensive, controversial content.
[03:23:06.754 --> 03:23:07.195]  Basically,
[03:23:08.100 --> 03:23:08.180]  It's
[03:23:32.225 --> 03:23:36.288]  And then all of a sudden, YouTube says, OK, we've really got to clamp down now.
[03:23:36.788 --> 03:23:38.670]  So they realized that they were losing.
[03:23:39.030 --> 03:23:40.251]  This is Silicon Valley.
[03:23:40.271 --> 03:23:45.074]  Paul, you remember, I mean, remember my thing I used to say, we should be under the radar and not talk about how successful we are.
[03:23:45.134 --> 03:23:46.535]  But we've got to do it now.
[03:23:46.715 --> 03:23:51.238]  What do you make about, there's like 16 shows the last couple of years, I can count.
[03:23:51.578 --> 03:24:00.865]  There's like seven or eight of them right now, some of them five days a week, misrepresenting yours truly and you by name.
[03:24:02.410 --> 03:24:07.813]  Strongman attacks, this new show on Comedy Central called The Opposition.
[03:24:07.874 --> 03:24:12.817]  I mean, they are acting like we are Godzilla attacking Tokyo, man.
[03:24:12.837 --> 03:24:17.800]  No, I mean, it's the intensification of that.
[03:24:17.940 --> 03:24:20.902]  I mean, there would be the occasional attack on us, you know, in years past.
[03:24:20.942 --> 03:24:24.064]  You know, Media Matters would constantly attack us, but it was limited.
[03:24:24.084 --> 03:24:29.387]  Sure, and Cobra would attack once a month, but not like every other night, and just all attacking, attacking, attacking.
[03:24:30.253 --> 03:24:37.937]  I mean, I used to be able to write response articles to every hit piece, because, I mean, they were still quite regular, but it was, you know, manageable.
[03:24:38.317 --> 03:24:42.619]  Now if I did that, I'd literally need like a hundred of me to respond to them all.
[03:24:42.999 --> 03:24:45.981]  And it shows that they're petrified because our influence is growing.
[03:24:46.261 --> 03:24:49.703]  And we know that they're really an Islamic slash pedophile network.
[03:24:50.962 --> 03:24:52.043]  No, they actually are.
[03:24:52.283 --> 03:24:56.344]  It's a huge paedophile network that wants to overthrow Western civilization.
[03:24:56.644 --> 03:25:02.347]  They're finally coming out and admitting it, and we're the counterforce and people are really rallying behind us.
[03:25:02.367 --> 03:25:12.591]  Yeah, choose prosperity, true free society, wealth, honor, or do we want to choose under Islamic and paedophile rule and devil worshipper rule?
[03:25:12.851 --> 03:25:16.093]  That's why I'm still, a lot of days people say, Alex, why are you co-hosting when Paul's on?
[03:25:17.173 --> 03:25:18.254]  Skype's gotten unstable.
[03:25:18.274 --> 03:25:19.294]  I'm trying to get him in office.
[03:25:20.034 --> 03:25:21.595]  I'm trying to even get some crew member in the U.S.
[03:25:21.615 --> 03:25:22.455]  to go over there and help him.
[03:25:23.215 --> 03:25:25.736]  He's a great guy, but his Skype more and more is cutting out.
[03:25:26.696 --> 03:25:31.878]  So while we get the old Skyper going, I'll sit here some more with old Paul.
[03:25:32.238 --> 03:25:33.439]  Probably got a phone backup with him.
[03:25:33.839 --> 03:25:35.539]  But you never know where he is.
[03:25:35.559 --> 03:25:36.239]  I said he's in London.
[03:25:36.279 --> 03:25:37.040]  Is he in Spain?
[03:25:38.200 --> 03:25:39.100]  He's in Spain a lot.
[03:25:41.081 --> 03:25:43.502]  You know, I sit here and I laugh about this because I expected a fight.
[03:25:44.724 --> 03:25:47.406]  And I don't see it as losing to be censored or attacked.
[03:25:47.466 --> 03:25:48.246]  I see it as winning.
[03:25:48.766 --> 03:25:51.868]  But we really are facing the scum of the earth.
[03:25:51.888 --> 03:26:01.494]  I mean, we really are facing the worst people on the planet, and then the brainwashed idiots that follow them and believe in them.
[03:26:01.514 --> 03:26:02.575]  They don't understand.
[03:26:03.215 --> 03:26:05.396]  Prosperity is easy in human civilization.
[03:26:06.397 --> 03:26:10.740]  The elites have to get out of the way, though, and let the public have the wealth and have the inventions.
[03:26:11.817 --> 03:26:23.747]  But in Africa, in Asia, in Eastern Europe, in Latin America to a great extent, the elites decide to have a permanent ruling wealthy class and to use poverty to control people.
[03:26:24.748 --> 03:26:26.109]  And that's where we are.
[03:26:27.090 --> 03:26:28.652]  And we're here trying to stop that.
[03:26:28.732 --> 03:26:30.133]  Donald Trump's trying to stop that.
[03:26:31.534 --> 03:26:35.538]  And I don't know if we really deserve it as a whole, because do we really deserve this amount of decadence?
[03:26:36.838 --> 03:26:42.421]  Do we really deserve, you know, to actually have this much advantage if we're not going to appreciate it?
[03:26:42.441 --> 03:26:45.203]  And if we're just going to continue to bitch and gripe about it all day?
[03:26:46.224 --> 03:26:49.045]  But global corporations have done the demographic math.
[03:26:49.646 --> 03:26:50.967]  They've already exploited the third world.
[03:26:51.307 --> 03:26:56.110]  Now they're going to use that third world to take down the West and cement global hegemonic control.
[03:26:57.010 --> 03:26:57.991]  So that's all that's happening.
[03:26:59.246 --> 03:27:07.047]  We're funded by viewers like you, and we need a bigger war chest to really expand what we're doing, hire more crew members, launch a lot of new stuff that's going to get around the sensors.
[03:27:07.067 --> 03:27:12.688]  I'm going to make it really easy at Infowarsstore.com, where we have Emmerich's Essentials right now.
[03:27:13.148 --> 03:27:15.669]  We've never offered this, and we're just doing it as a huge promotion.
[03:27:15.689 --> 03:27:16.549]  50% off.
[03:27:16.589 --> 03:27:20.190]  Ladies and gentlemen, we basically don't make any money on that.
[03:27:20.550 --> 03:27:28.451]  Total Hygiene Pack, Starter Pack, Outdoor Pack, the great organic sunscreen, the great organic Be Away.
[03:27:29.534 --> 03:27:30.154]  Bug spray.
[03:27:30.855 --> 03:27:34.237]  We got 56% off on Supermail Vitality and BioTrue Selenium.
[03:27:34.477 --> 03:27:36.038]  You can get them separate or together.
[03:27:37.138 --> 03:27:38.779]  That says 56% off.
[03:27:38.819 --> 03:27:39.300]  I think that's 45.
[03:27:39.540 --> 03:27:40.901]  That might be a typo.
[03:27:42.221 --> 03:27:42.922]  No, no, no, it's true.
[03:27:42.982 --> 03:27:46.464]  Supermail is 50 something, so I guess with the Selenium it is.
[03:27:46.504 --> 03:27:47.965]  It's 45 with the X2.
[03:27:48.905 --> 03:27:50.786]  X2 is 45% off.
[03:27:50.806 --> 03:27:54.589]  But BioTrue Selenium with Supermail is 56% off, so that's another.
[03:27:55.029 --> 03:27:56.630]  I can't even keep track of all these specials.
[03:27:56.970 --> 03:27:58.531]  These are the new specials, but I will tell you.
[03:27:59.926 --> 03:28:07.509]  We will end the super male vitality in the next couple days because I know that we're not getting more until maybe late October, early November.
[03:28:08.849 --> 03:28:11.070]  And so I do not want to sell out of it.
[03:28:12.411 --> 03:28:12.851]  That is.
[03:28:15.080 --> 03:28:15.720]  The whole point.
[03:28:15.840 --> 03:28:24.423]  So, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:28:24.443 --> 03:28:25.344]  888-253-3139.
[03:28:25.364 --> 03:28:28.645]  And again, we couldn't do any of this without you, the listeners.
[03:28:29.305 --> 03:28:33.506]  I was going to get updates from our reporters today down in Houston, but just who knows what's going on down there, you know?
[03:28:34.047 --> 03:28:35.327]  They're too busy probably saving people.
[03:28:35.367 --> 03:28:35.907]  I know they are.
[03:28:36.447 --> 03:28:37.648]  And we sent down some more trucks.
[03:28:38.661 --> 03:28:41.182]  A big army truck went down there with the Quentin.
[03:28:42.102 --> 03:28:47.804]  And so, an officer drowned in his patrol car in the RV floodwaters.
[03:28:47.824 --> 03:28:50.025]  They're now starting to find dead bodies.
[03:28:50.725 --> 03:28:56.026]  And the water is continuing to rise, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:28:57.587 --> 03:28:59.308]  So, there's Art Acevedo.
[03:28:59.348 --> 03:29:00.648]  He used to be the Austin Police Chief.
[03:29:06.747 --> 03:29:09.068]  And now they're reporting the levees are going to spill into downtown Houston.
[03:29:09.308 --> 03:29:11.329]  Hey, has anybody called our reporters?
[03:29:12.429 --> 03:29:16.551]  Because I know... Yeah, so Zimmerman's on a helicopter?
[03:29:18.652 --> 03:29:20.613]  Okay, we'll get him to get the footage out as soon as possible.
[03:29:21.073 --> 03:29:21.753]  What about Clinton?
[03:29:22.514 --> 03:29:25.475]  Why don't I just call him and just get an update in the next segment?
[03:29:26.415 --> 03:29:29.777]  If you guys don't have his number, just come on in here and I'll give it to you.
[03:29:30.877 --> 03:29:32.838]  And we can call him.
[03:29:32.858 --> 03:29:34.039]  We can get a reporter on.
[03:29:35.029 --> 03:29:35.889]  We'll do that straight ahead.
[03:29:36.149 --> 03:29:37.610]  Paul's having more and more Skype problems.
[03:29:37.630 --> 03:29:40.050]  That's why I'm usually in here now riding shotgun with him.
[03:29:40.090 --> 03:29:41.870]  Hell, getting on my phone is like an act of Congress.
[03:29:42.991 --> 03:29:43.991]  So we'll find out more.
[03:29:44.071 --> 03:29:46.071]  Pray for the folks down in Houston.
[03:29:46.571 --> 03:29:49.852]  Paul Watson is back, but we better keep him on his line this time.
[03:29:49.872 --> 03:29:51.312]  We're gonna keep him on his line.
[03:29:51.432 --> 03:29:52.593]  That phone right there ready now.
[03:29:52.633 --> 03:29:53.473]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.973 --> 03:29:55.573]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.513 --> 03:29:59.194]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.556 --> 03:30:07.078]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[03:30:07.538 --> 03:30:13.580]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[03:30:13.981 --> 03:30:16.782]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:17.162 --> 03:30:20.163]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:30:20.363 --> 03:30:23.805]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[03:30:24.145 --> 03:30:25.906]  The left controls culture.
[03:30:25.926 --> 03:30:26.906]  They control arts.
[03:30:26.986 --> 03:30:28.207]  They control entertainment.
[03:30:28.487 --> 03:30:35.594]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:30:35.634 --> 03:30:38.036]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[03:30:38.517 --> 03:30:42.380]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[03:30:42.441 --> 03:30:44.502]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate.
[03:30:45.123 --> 03:30:50.504]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[03:30:50.765 --> 03:30:57.006]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[03:30:57.086 --> 03:30:58.767]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[03:30:58.927 --> 03:31:00.107]  It's available right now.
[03:31:00.427 --> 03:31:02.608]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.

[03:33:44.903 --> 03:33:46.485]  Cheers.
[03:33:46.745 --> 03:33:47.966]  Candice Owens.
[03:33:47.986 --> 03:33:50.949]  You can check her out on Twitter at redhillblack.
[03:33:51.429 --> 03:34:00.877]  The YouTube video which shot to prominence a few days ago in the aftermath of Charlottesville was entitled, I don't care about Charlottesville, the KKK or white supremacy.
[03:34:01.357 --> 03:34:04.220]  And we've got a clip of that now if we can go to the clip.
[03:34:07.478 --> 03:34:08.479]  Do we have a clip?
[03:34:25.842 --> 03:34:28.144]  That was Candice Owens with the viral YouTube video.
[03:34:28.164 --> 03:34:30.125]  She's also an entrepreneur and a public speaker.
[03:34:30.165 --> 03:34:31.066]  Candice, welcome to the show.
[03:34:31.086 --> 03:34:32.127]  Thank you guys for having me.
[03:34:55.473 --> 03:35:03.657]  Now, before we get into the Charlottesville stuff, your Twitter bio, and I like this, it says, force-fed the red pill, kinda liked it.
[03:35:04.237 --> 03:35:15.302]  Now, if we go back a couple of years, you actually started out, not to be rude here, but you started out as something of a social justice warrior, or at least you were accused of being one by some people.
[03:35:15.862 --> 03:35:21.885]  Tell us about social autopsy and how the fallout from that changed your entire perspective.
[03:35:23.092 --> 03:35:23.272]  Right.
[03:35:23.312 --> 03:35:24.193]  So I mean, it's a big story.
[03:35:24.233 --> 03:35:28.857]  I'm going to sort of try to give you the short inversion here so we don't use up all the time here.
[03:35:28.937 --> 03:35:38.706]  But basically, I created a platform somewhat naively about something that I was passionate about, which is just children that are armed with social media and have cell phones.
[03:35:39.346 --> 03:35:44.171]  They face a different set of rules and they go through something that you and I didn't experience when we were in school.
[03:35:44.251 --> 03:35:48.975]  I really do think that cell phones and social media can be dangerous, which is why we're seeing so many
[03:35:49.637 --> 03:35:49.697]  I'm
[03:36:11.352 --> 03:36:15.577]  I knew nothing about, you know, trolls and internet anonymity.
[03:36:15.617 --> 03:36:24.166]  I was thinking totally outside of that box and landed myself directly in the Gamergate scanner, which I'm sure you guys have covered on this show quite extensively.
[03:36:24.186 --> 03:36:33.196]  A woman named Zoe Quinn contacted me within a few hours of us being on Kickstarter, and she basically introduced herself as Ground Zero.
[03:36:33.837 --> 03:36:34.558]  We're good to go.
[03:37:01.055 --> 03:37:06.801]  By people with these obvious for Trump sort of, you know, email addresses.
[03:37:07.362 --> 03:37:11.025]  And they were, you know, calling me a nigger, threatening to tar and feather my family.
[03:37:11.126 --> 03:37:13.128]  Just this really vicious, nasty attack.
[03:37:13.168 --> 03:37:16.251]  And it was beyond obvious to me that it was being orchestrated by her.
[03:37:16.711 --> 03:37:18.273]  And I made that claim on my Twitter account.
[03:37:18.313 --> 03:37:22.117]  I said, you know, I don't know anything about the Gamergate scandal, but I can tell you that this girl Zoe Quinn is no victim.
[03:37:22.678 --> 03:37:23.759]  She is harassing herself.
[03:37:24.409 --> 03:37:28.591]  And I did not for a single second believe that these were white men that were trolling me.
[03:37:28.611 --> 03:37:36.174]  It was very obviously an organized movement from her, who at the time was the anti-harassment chief for Twitter.
[03:37:36.754 --> 03:37:39.995]  Making that assertion, I woke up the next day and the left media was contacting me.
[03:37:40.055 --> 03:37:50.039]  I had Louise Mensch from The Guardian trying to get in contact with me, The Washington Post trying to get in contact with me, New York Magazine trying to get in contact with me, all in this coordinated effort to smear my name.
[03:37:50.706 --> 03:37:59.048]  And to stop the funding of social autopsy by likening us to a platform that was going to assist pedophiles, which is what they wrote about me.
[03:37:59.608 --> 03:38:05.489]  And they said that, you know, they gaslit me as well, saying that this girl thought Zoe Quinn was harassing herself.
[03:38:05.549 --> 03:38:07.789]  You know, she got sucked into the Gamergate myth.
[03:38:08.410 --> 03:38:09.830]  And it worked.
[03:38:09.890 --> 03:38:14.391]  You know, the people that were once interested in funding us were kind of scared to touch us at that point.
[03:38:14.411 --> 03:38:18.292]  When you see any company that's being associated with the word pedophile, you back off.
[03:38:19.532 --> 03:38:20.212]  You know, so
[03:38:21.758 --> 03:38:41.951]  Miraculously, people that were reaching out and telling the true story of what happened was Breitbart, people like Mike Cernovich and the Ralph Retort, publications and people that are white nationalists were stepping to the plate and defending an African-American entrepreneur who they all told me, we disagree with what you're doing entirely, but what's happening to you is wrong.
[03:38:42.828 --> 03:38:44.689]  Obviously, it threw me down the rabbit hole.
[03:38:44.789 --> 03:38:47.990]  I considered myself a liberal at that time, and I woke up.
[03:38:48.050 --> 03:38:50.910]  I was forced to face the facts.
[03:38:50.990 --> 03:38:54.111]  By the way, Candace, I know about your story, but this is riveting.
[03:38:54.131 --> 03:38:58.933]  I want to beg you to come on the full show sometime with Paul and I and share these stories.
[03:38:59.793 --> 03:39:04.674]  I didn't believe it until I saw it protesting the KKK and stuff on video 18 years ago.
[03:39:04.794 --> 03:39:08.335]  Later you learn it was actually leftists leading it.
[03:39:08.755 --> 03:39:16.757]  White supremacy was so unpopular that nine times out of ten it was literally run by the Southern Poverty Law Center or a big foundation or the ADL.
[03:39:17.018 --> 03:39:18.078]  They've sent men caught doing it.
[03:39:18.118 --> 03:39:25.760]  But it just shows how they tried to set you up, bully you, to make you their cause celeb and you would have never even known it.
[03:39:26.960 --> 03:39:31.341]  Wow, I mean, it's amazing that you sensed it though and realized something was going on.
[03:39:31.561 --> 03:39:32.442]  How did you sense it?
[03:39:33.142 --> 03:39:33.942]  Because this is how they do it.
[03:39:34.182 --> 03:39:43.965]  When people show up at liberal colleges, whether it's in the UK or the US or Canada, they herd everybody in when they're 18 and say, there's white supremacists on campus, get in here, we'll protect you.
[03:39:44.025 --> 03:39:44.705]  This is on the news.
[03:39:45.025 --> 03:39:48.986]  And they call you in and then put you into a cult in the name of protecting you.
[03:39:49.306 --> 03:39:52.050]  That's how, you know, gangs work in bad parts of town or prison.
[03:39:52.210 --> 03:39:54.013]  They say, you gotta be in our gang or you won't be safe.
[03:39:54.233 --> 03:39:56.616]  The Aryan Nations, you know, the Black Nationalists, whatever.
[03:39:57.197 --> 03:40:01.724]  Literally, this is cult programming that you expose going down the rabbit hole.
[03:40:01.744 --> 03:40:03.827]  I know I'm jumping in, but Paul, what a great guest.
[03:40:05.743 --> 03:40:08.365]  Alex, I just wanted to follow on from that by asking Candice.
[03:40:09.106 --> 03:40:21.557]  I put up a cartoon on my Twitter page yesterday and it shows a donkey in a suit, obviously representing the Democratic Party, standing in front of a graveyard entitled Chicago Murder Victims, a graveyard full of headstones.
[03:40:21.918 --> 03:40:27.342]  And the donkey, Candice, is saying, good news, we removed all of the Confederate statues.
[03:40:27.383 --> 03:40:29.905]  Now, of course, this is what you touched on in your viral video.
[03:40:30.465 --> 03:40:42.992]  If the left, and this is what Charles Barkley, by the way, was called a white supremacist for, but Candace, if the left and the media really cared about black lives, what would they be telling black people to get energised about?
[03:40:43.293 --> 03:40:48.055]  Would it be the fact that 900 black babies are aborted every day in the United States?
[03:40:48.295 --> 03:40:52.798]  Would it be the fact that 93% of black murder victims are killed by other black people?
[03:40:53.238 --> 03:40:56.120]  Or would it be 200-year-old statues, Candace?
[03:40:56.804 --> 03:40:57.245]  Absolutely.
[03:40:57.285 --> 03:40:57.565]  You're right.
[03:40:57.785 --> 03:40:58.966]  It's a total distraction.
[03:40:59.306 --> 03:41:00.768]  They don't care about the black community.
[03:41:00.788 --> 03:41:01.869]  They care about the black vote.
[03:41:02.429 --> 03:41:06.053]  The things that are affecting us, which you mentioned, is the fact that there is black on black crime.
[03:41:06.133 --> 03:41:12.499]  You know, upwards of 90% of the people, black African-Americans that are killed, are killed by black people.
[03:41:13.078 --> 03:41:23.263]  Um, so crime, education statistics, the prison system, which was basically built by the Clinton campaign, which is why to me it's the most fascinating thing in the entire, in the entire world to learn.
[03:41:23.323 --> 03:41:23.823]  Exactly.
[03:41:23.863 --> 03:41:30.906]  The tripling of the black prison population happened since 1993 with the Clinton saying, we're going to bring the super predators to heel.
[03:41:31.226 --> 03:41:33.427]  And then they've got the nerve, a heel like a dog.
[03:41:33.687 --> 03:41:36.568]  They got the nerve to say, Donald Trump is the bad guy.
[03:41:37.229 --> 03:41:37.589]  Correct.
[03:41:37.909 --> 03:41:38.429]  Absolutely.
[03:41:38.489 --> 03:41:42.531]  So it's, it's a tactic they use us every four years, you know, to shepherd,
[03:41:43.134 --> 03:41:46.856]  You know, our votes in the Democratic Party, and they're widening their net now.
[03:41:46.916 --> 03:41:50.258]  Now they're using trans people and lesbian, bi.
[03:41:50.398 --> 03:41:59.122]  If you're a part of any category, it's all identity politics, and they're using you to feel like you have to care more about the social issues, social issues that they themselves are creating, okay?
[03:41:59.442 --> 03:42:00.943]  They are funding these protests.
[03:42:00.963 --> 03:42:03.824]  They are funding black people getting arrested, and people don't understand.
[03:42:03.864 --> 03:42:07.486]  You get arrested protesting like an animal, that's on your record forever.
[03:42:07.546 --> 03:42:12.709]  So these black people are going to have difficulty getting jobs, getting into schools, but they don't think that way because, as you mentioned, Alex,
[03:42:13.870 --> 03:42:15.251]  They are young.
[03:42:15.612 --> 03:42:20.377]  They're all passion and zero intelligence because they don't have real life issues like a mortgage.
[03:42:20.938 --> 03:42:25.883]  And it's easy, I guess, for them to just believe that everybody they've ever known is a white nationalist and a racist.
[03:42:26.203 --> 03:42:26.644]  Exactly.
[03:42:26.684 --> 03:42:28.886]  And there are some white nationalists and racists out there.
[03:42:29.006 --> 03:42:33.091]  Usually they're very poor, mentally ill people that blame everybody for their problems.
[03:42:34.372 --> 03:42:47.701]  What's incredible is it turned out that in Charlottesville, indeed, the entire leadership of the white supremacist groups were, quote, former Obama and former Black Lives Matter and former Occupy just a year ago.
[03:42:47.861 --> 03:42:49.202]  No, they weren't just former.
[03:42:49.622 --> 03:42:54.726]  And they had State Department officials out there, the first people on the news, directing it all.
[03:42:55.226 --> 03:42:59.089]  I mean, it is just amazing how they staged this stuff.
[03:42:59.844 --> 03:43:00.444]  It is amazing.
[03:43:00.484 --> 03:43:03.226]  And so, you know, for me, did they kick me down?
[03:43:03.326 --> 03:43:03.746]  Absolutely.
[03:43:03.766 --> 03:43:06.867]  But the problem is when you try to kill somebody, you better make sure they're dead.
[03:43:07.208 --> 03:43:11.230]  OK, so unfortunately, by the end of social autopsy, I was clinging to life support.
[03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:13.451]  But I'm back and I'm back with a vengeance.
[03:43:13.511 --> 03:43:22.315]  And I'm going to make sure that I reach out to every black person, every community to wake them up to this disgusting liberal lie and mass brainwashing.
[03:43:23.763 --> 03:43:34.850]  Paul, I'm going to shut up for your amazing guests, but can you get her to recap for people that might have missed that, how they tried to intimidate her with their own threats?
[03:43:35.130 --> 03:43:36.531]  First, they reach out as the savior.
[03:43:36.891 --> 03:43:39.032]  I'm the savior and you're going to work under me.
[03:43:39.412 --> 03:43:42.074]  Obviously, that woman is just a cutout for a larger intelligence op.
[03:43:42.274 --> 03:43:43.095]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[03:43:43.715 --> 03:43:44.796]  Uh, large tech companies.
[03:43:45.357 --> 03:43:46.778]  And then, then she gets attacked.
[03:43:46.838 --> 03:43:49.020]  She's supposed to go, oh, you're my savior.
[03:43:49.261 --> 03:43:53.705]  That's like somebody on the side of the road, a good looking woman with her car broke down, and you pull over and you get mugged.
[03:43:54.025 --> 03:43:56.227]  I mean, this is literally scam.
[03:43:56.267 --> 03:43:57.769]  This is sensational, Paul.
[03:43:58.769 --> 03:44:04.431]  Well, I'm sure Candice will explain it better than I, but that was what gave her the red pill, right, Candice?
[03:44:04.471 --> 03:44:10.792]  The fact that you were basically bullied, intimidated by these people who were supposedly on your side to begin with.
[03:44:11.192 --> 03:44:15.674]  Again, exemplifying the fact all they're interested in, Candice, is power.
[03:44:15.914 --> 03:44:17.874]  It's not about protecting minorities.
[03:44:18.074 --> 03:44:21.115]  It's about furthering their own political agenda, correct?
[03:44:21.895 --> 03:44:22.375]  Absolutely.
[03:44:22.395 --> 03:44:23.756]  It is all about power.
[03:44:25.596 --> 03:44:27.957]  Speaking of Kanye West, do you think he's starting to wake up?
[03:44:29.330 --> 03:44:29.951]  He's been awake.
[03:44:30.031 --> 03:44:31.812]  I mean, I'm the biggest Kanye West fan.
[03:44:31.832 --> 03:44:34.174]  Kanye West has never subscribed to any type of politics.
[03:44:34.194 --> 03:44:42.562]  You know, it started with people didn't understand what he was doing when he snatched the trophy from Taylor Swift on stage, and it seemed awful because she was innocent, but he was saying something that needed to be said.
[03:44:42.722 --> 03:44:49.548]  And so maybe, see, I even bought into mainstream hype attacking him because the more I learned about him, he was willing to march in there when everybody's against Trump in front of everybody.
[03:44:50.188 --> 03:44:50.729]  He's a genius.
[03:44:50.769 --> 03:44:53.731]  Kanye West is a genius, and he's never subscribed to group things.
[03:44:53.751 --> 03:44:55.373]  He's never subscribed to any politics.
[03:44:56.435 --> 03:45:04.401]  And I wrote very early on, before I got involved in politics, if you understand, if you consider yourself a fan of Kanye West, there's no way that you cannot be supporting Donald Trump.
[03:45:04.421 --> 03:45:14.229]  Because what they're both doing is sort of slaying this idea of grouping, this idea of... And again, I was conned that he was bad, but the more I researched, the guy's so... They ate for him in a mental hospital!
[03:45:14.249 --> 03:45:15.510]  They're so scared of him.
[03:45:15.610 --> 03:45:15.910]  Paul?
[03:45:17.331 --> 03:45:25.778]  No, exactly, and that's what I wanted to get onto with Candace, because I read an interview with you, Candace, where you talked about being bullied for, quote, acting white.
[03:45:26.377 --> 03:45:42.883]  Now, this is something that I wondered about and wanted to investigate for a video is, you know, the influences on black people of popular culture, of the fact that a lot of it went in the direction of, you know, gangster chic in the late 80s into the 90s, in terms of rap and hip hop music.
[03:45:43.493 --> 03:45:45.334]  Do you think that that's just an outlier?
[03:45:45.354 --> 03:45:49.376]  Do you think that that had a very real impact on black incarceration rates?
[03:45:49.717 --> 03:45:55.180]  The fact that we saw this glorification of violence and criminality through the popular culture?
[03:45:55.740 --> 03:46:00.443]  Or do you think that that's more of an outlier and most of it is related to socioeconomics?
[03:46:01.283 --> 03:46:02.424]  I was going to say it's 50-50.
[03:46:02.504 --> 03:46:04.505]  It's definitely partially socioeconomics.
[03:46:04.565 --> 03:46:12.750]  You know, if you put somebody's back against the wall and they don't have, you know, money to feed their children or, you know, any place to sleep, they're going to commit criminal acts, of course.
[03:46:13.466 --> 03:46:16.148]  But these criminal acts are being glorified in the media.
[03:46:16.168 --> 03:46:19.530]  This is how the media presents black people always, right, as these gangbangers.
[03:46:19.550 --> 03:46:28.316]  You don't see people like me, and there are millions of black people like me who are super intelligent, who don't subscribe to this sort of, you know, gangster mentality, but that we're not given a voice.
[03:46:28.396 --> 03:46:30.057]  Instead, Black Lives Matter is given a voice.
[03:46:30.117 --> 03:46:33.159]  These people who write these absurd lists of demands are given a voice.
[03:46:33.618 --> 03:46:35.099]  No, I mean, that's what I've noticed, Candice.
[03:46:35.119 --> 03:46:36.461]  They seem to reserve the most hateful vitriol.
[03:46:36.481 --> 03:46:37.481]  I'm talking about the alt-left.
[03:46:55.416 --> 03:46:59.059]  For smart, educated, successful black people.
[03:46:59.099 --> 03:47:12.590]  I mean, The Root, which is a black publication, far left, came out and called Charles Barkley a white supremacist because he said black people should focus more on education and financial success than getting angry over 200 year old statues.
[03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:24.098]  Now, you also covered in the video the fact that your everyday life, your day-to-day activities, you just don't see this race hate, you know, in your interactions with ordinary people.
[03:47:24.418 --> 03:47:32.064]  You know, America had eight years under Obama, a black president, when we heard virtually nothing about the KKK, nothing about white supremacists.
[03:47:32.564 --> 03:47:36.307]  Why are we suddenly, wall to wall, hearing about it now?
[03:47:37.489 --> 03:47:39.610]  Because the media is trying to teach people a lesson.
[03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:41.451]  You didn't vote the way that we told you to.
[03:47:41.571 --> 03:47:44.553]  Obviously, everyone, they wanted, their money was invested in Hillary Clinton.
[03:47:44.773 --> 03:47:45.053]  Okay?
[03:47:45.093 --> 03:47:52.397]  They spent time, a lot of time, dedicated to labeling Trump as a racist, a sexist, I mean, a rapist at one point.
[03:47:52.538 --> 03:47:54.919]  Anything that ended with an "-ist," Trump was labeled.
[03:47:55.079 --> 03:47:56.820]  And they thought that they had the election in the bag.
[03:47:57.484 --> 03:47:58.605]  And they lost the election.
[03:47:58.645 --> 03:47:59.406]  So what are they going to do?
[03:47:59.426 --> 03:48:03.530]  They're going to try to make it seem like all of their baseless threats are real.
[03:48:03.950 --> 03:48:05.752]  So now they're going to follow KKK's every move.
[03:48:05.772 --> 03:48:12.599]  They're going to follow these sort of extremist rights who represent this much of the population to say to people, look what happened.
[03:48:12.639 --> 03:48:16.082]  We warned you that if you voted for Donald Trump, this is what was going to happen.
[03:48:16.122 --> 03:48:17.764]  They are going to realize
[03:48:18.004 --> 03:48:19.044]  So where does it end?
[03:48:19.064 --> 03:48:20.485]  Because you don't want to be called a racist.
[03:48:20.505 --> 03:48:22.646]  Everybody kind of keeps getting in line and going along with it.
[03:48:22.766 --> 03:48:23.766]  The Republicans get in line with it.
[03:48:23.786 --> 03:48:24.606]  And as you experience yourself...
[03:48:37.671 --> 03:48:42.535]  We've tracked the ISPs, I've got to do another video on this, on the comments where there's all this race stuff going on.
[03:48:42.815 --> 03:48:51.222]  They'll have the white supremacist and the black supremacist and it's the same IP addresses with a bot just running race garbage to get everybody fighting with each other.
[03:48:51.863 --> 03:48:52.744]  Right, absolutely.
[03:48:53.584 --> 03:49:03.933]  Where it ends, people like me, educated black people, have to stand up and we have to start speaking out and I appreciate these characters like Charlie Kirk and Milo Yiannopoulos who go out
[03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.889]  We're good to go.
[03:49:34.887 --> 03:49:38.531]  I've read some of your family history, which you talked about in the interview, Candice.
[03:49:38.591 --> 03:49:40.433]  You were far from privileged.
[03:49:40.473 --> 03:49:42.835]  Your family had its problems socioeconomically.
[03:49:43.216 --> 03:49:48.661]  But again, you say, here's a quote which I enjoyed, you keep a group captive by keeping it divided against itself.
[03:49:48.681 --> 03:49:54.507]  You also said our programming can only be overridden by real experiences, which is what you talked about in the video.
[03:49:54.888 --> 03:49:58.031]  How much of this, you know, moral panic, this hysteria over racism,
[03:49:58.771 --> 03:50:23.689]  Is the result of black people and white people just not talking to each other and instead being told how to view others by the media, by... Well that's the victory is totally dividing everybody where you can't even have a prayer vigil now without being beaten up by crazy virtue signaling white people wanting to show they're not racist so they go beat up some Christian guy that has nothing to do with white supremacism as they spit all over him.
[03:50:23.749 --> 03:50:25.070]  I mean this is mind control.
[03:50:25.816 --> 03:50:26.897]  Right, it is mind control.
[03:50:27.117 --> 03:50:36.463]  And to answer Paul's question, this programming, the only way that it's going to get overwritten, because it's crazy to me, like you said, that people actually place more stock in what they're being told versus what they're experiencing.
[03:50:36.483 --> 03:50:38.284]  So that is to say that if you look on the news and it says,
[03:50:38.737 --> 03:50:39.497]  It's pouring rain.
[03:50:39.897 --> 03:50:41.538]  And you walk outside and it's sunshine.
[03:50:41.558 --> 03:50:44.119]  These people will look at you and say, it's pouring rain.
[03:50:44.199 --> 03:50:46.020]  Which is like, what are you talking about?
[03:50:46.060 --> 03:50:46.860]  You know what I mean?
[03:50:47.100 --> 03:50:54.223]  You have to remind people that they should be placing more stock in what they are feeling, what they are actually experiencing.
[03:50:54.243 --> 03:50:56.543]  In their own instincts, their own common sense.
[03:50:56.603 --> 03:50:57.884]  Exactly like you.
[03:50:58.004 --> 03:50:59.705]  In fact, that's the essence of what we do.
[03:50:59.745 --> 03:51:00.625]  You just crystallized it.
[03:51:00.645 --> 03:51:01.925]  I was thinking about this last night.
[03:51:02.205 --> 03:51:06.267]  It's just about going off what you actually experience, not off what you're fed.
[03:51:07.102 --> 03:51:12.065]  Right, and if I believed in what CNN was telling me every night, what if I stepped one foot out my front door, okay?
[03:51:12.706 --> 03:51:17.469]  There would be a KKK member, you know, calling me the N-word and threatening to kill me.
[03:51:17.509 --> 03:51:18.729]  That's just not what happens every day.
[03:51:18.749 --> 03:51:20.170]  That's not the correspondence that happens.
[03:51:20.190 --> 03:51:24.113]  But it does seem like they're trying to cause the whiplash to get some people to actually do that.
[03:51:24.453 --> 03:51:27.075]  You read the WikiLeaks, they say, we're losing, the people are waking up.
[03:51:27.415 --> 03:51:27.875]  What do we do?
[03:51:27.895 --> 03:51:29.116]  Well, they say culture war.
[03:51:30.437 --> 03:51:31.838]  That's a fancy word for race war.
[03:51:31.918 --> 03:51:35.080]  I don't see it happening, but in a minority of
[03:51:35.900 --> 03:51:42.902]  Uh, easily suggestible people who run the span of skin color, it's going to have them flip out and start going out and shooting congressmen and stuff.
[03:51:43.103 --> 03:51:44.123]  So where do you think this ends?
[03:51:45.303 --> 03:51:47.404]  Um, like I said, it's a movement.
[03:51:47.444 --> 03:51:49.705]  I consider it a five by five by five movement.
[03:51:49.785 --> 03:51:54.647]  My goal is to wake up five people, have them wake up another five people, five black people.
[03:51:54.707 --> 03:51:56.447]  My focus is the African American community.
[03:51:57.007 --> 03:52:03.109]  Um, and at the end of the day, if you can't control the African American community and you can't control the minorities, um, the game is lost for the liberals.
[03:52:03.450 --> 03:52:03.850]  It really is.
[03:52:03.870 --> 03:52:04.630]  It's all they've got left.
[03:52:05.091 --> 03:52:07.472]  Is the separation identity politics?
[03:52:10.333 --> 03:52:18.157]  And Alex, I mean, that's that's what Michael Moore was talking about yesterday when he said, yeah, we just we just have to get rid of all the white people and we've got it locked down forever.
[03:52:18.557 --> 03:52:21.559]  If we educate the black people and it's not going to be as easy for them.
[03:52:21.579 --> 03:52:24.500]  You know, Trump got way more black support than Mitt Romney did.
[03:52:25.300 --> 03:52:26.261]  The other aspect is,
[03:52:27.061 --> 03:52:34.165]  Candice, you know, never have people been so transfixed and enraged about history while simultaneously knowing so little about it.
[03:52:34.185 --> 03:52:36.907]  It's like Martin Luther King's speeches.
[03:52:37.207 --> 03:52:40.649]  We had the anniversary yesterday, the March on Washington.
[03:52:41.049 --> 03:52:45.392]  It's all about integration, treating people as you wish to be treated.
[03:52:45.692 --> 03:52:47.393]  It's about true equality.
[03:52:47.813 --> 03:52:51.155]  Black Lives Matter, they try and segregate people.
[03:52:51.375 --> 03:52:57.139]  You've got white progressives who say, stay in your lane, don't say anything about Black Lives Matter unless you'll give them permission.
[03:52:57.539 --> 03:53:01.201]  They're the ones pushing segregation, the very opposite of Martin Luther King.
[03:53:01.241 --> 03:53:05.023]  You just said it, it's the white knight controllers, and I'm not making it racial, that's what it is.
[03:53:05.343 --> 03:53:12.968]  It's social engineers, all about power as you said, who cold-bloodedly know what they're doing, where they can then dictate to everyone they're the high priest.
[03:53:13.028 --> 03:53:15.189]  It's a new religion, it's a cult.
[03:53:16.181 --> 03:53:17.261]  It is absolutely cool.
[03:53:17.301 --> 03:53:18.202]  I couldn't agree more.
[03:53:18.382 --> 03:53:22.423]  Everything you're saying is spot on, especially in terms of them knowing nothing about their own history.
[03:53:22.463 --> 03:53:25.404]  They celebrate these figures, you know, like Malcolm X, right?
[03:53:25.564 --> 03:53:26.384]  Black Lives Matter.
[03:53:26.424 --> 03:53:31.246]  They love Malcolm X. Malcolm X is, you know, number one who told you about the liberal tricks.
[03:53:31.466 --> 03:53:33.886]  You know, he said, you know, you have to stay away from liberals.
[03:53:34.247 --> 03:53:40.408]  They'll kind of get you drinking the Kool-Aid and they'll have you thinking that the people that are oppressing you are your friends and the people that are being oppressed are your enemies.
[03:53:40.428 --> 03:53:42.189]  And that's literally what is happening right now.
[03:53:42.885 --> 03:53:45.771]  Um, so they only know sound bites of their history, which is a huge problem.
[03:53:45.791 --> 03:53:52.365]  And again, uh, another area that I can inject myself in helping African Americans and other minorities wake up.
[03:53:52.694 --> 03:53:53.695]  Where does your gut tell you?
[03:53:53.975 --> 03:53:55.176]  I'm sorry to crash your interview, Paul.
[03:53:55.196 --> 03:53:55.936]  It's just so powerful.
[03:53:55.957 --> 03:53:56.777]  Plus, you're having Skype problems.
[03:53:59.099 --> 03:53:59.900]  This is my last question.
[03:53:59.920 --> 03:54:01.120]  Please come on the full show.
[03:54:01.160 --> 03:54:01.841]  I want to get you both on.
[03:54:01.881 --> 03:54:02.902]  I try to get Paul on all the time.
[03:54:03.102 --> 03:54:03.742]  People love Paul.
[03:54:03.782 --> 03:54:05.584]  He's kind of being pushed off YouTube right now.
[03:54:05.604 --> 03:54:06.825]  I think he should do more live stuff.
[03:54:06.845 --> 03:54:10.608]  He should do it on our own streams, our own radio stations, because he's being censored on YouTube.
[03:54:10.628 --> 03:54:12.269]  But clearly, censorship is where they're coming.
[03:54:12.709 --> 03:54:13.390]  More demonization.
[03:54:13.410 --> 03:54:14.571]  I think they're going to false flag.
[03:54:15.051 --> 03:54:17.071]  You know, blow up a black college or something, God forbid.
[03:54:17.092 --> 03:54:20.872]  I mean, I can just get in the mind of these globalists that are against humans, period.
[03:54:21.112 --> 03:54:21.933]  They're psychopaths.
[03:54:21.953 --> 03:54:23.353]  They want to play us off against each other.
[03:54:23.593 --> 03:54:27.634]  They could be a Chinese psychopath, an African psychopath, a German psychopath.
[03:54:27.874 --> 03:54:28.974]  Psychopaths are all the same.
[03:54:29.234 --> 03:54:32.015]  They're less than 1% of the population, but they tend to run everything.
[03:54:32.395 --> 03:54:33.996]  So how are they going to hit us?
[03:54:34.016 --> 03:54:35.596]  Because I think they're losing right now.
[03:54:36.445 --> 03:54:37.065]  They're losing.
[03:54:37.105 --> 03:54:38.306]  They're massively losing.
[03:54:38.346 --> 03:54:40.867]  You need but turn off CNN to understand that they're losing.
[03:54:41.047 --> 03:54:42.908]  Like I said, I'm one person.
[03:54:42.948 --> 03:54:44.829]  I go away, another 10 pop up.
[03:54:44.869 --> 03:54:47.890]  You know, you try to censor Diamond and Silk, you know, I pop up, you know.
[03:54:49.231 --> 03:54:51.232]  I don't know what their next move is.
[03:54:52.592 --> 03:54:53.613]  I just see them as losing.
[03:54:53.653 --> 03:54:59.857]  I see they're fighting an uphill battle right now because they're getting more and more out of their minds.
[03:54:59.877 --> 03:55:00.898]  It's just more and more outrageous.
[03:55:00.938 --> 03:55:06.702]  I mean, look at that list of demands that was created by the Black Lives Matter leader of the Louisville chapter.
[03:55:06.722 --> 03:55:09.183]  She co-founded that chapter in Louisville.
[03:55:09.724 --> 03:55:15.688]  And you cannot read that, even if you're a Black Lives Matter supporter and go, OK, we're kind of jumping off the deep end here.
[03:55:16.366 --> 03:55:17.587]  Uh, so I don't know what they're next.
[03:55:17.627 --> 03:55:28.036]  I do think that they will do something incredibly aggressive like we saw in Charlottesville, but like I said, the people are waking up, um, and my voices, we're getting louder, and theirs are going to eventually get smaller.
[03:55:28.516 --> 03:55:33.260]  I can't believe they're so bold that all the white nationalists are, like, working for Obama a year ago.
[03:55:33.280 --> 03:55:34.862]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[03:55:34.882 --> 03:55:37.604]  It's pretty obvious.
[03:55:37.944 --> 03:55:38.925]  Yeah.
[03:55:39.506 --> 03:55:40.787]  Paul, I'm taking over the interview, but go ahead.
[03:55:42.202 --> 03:55:47.628]  No, I mean, we had one of them on the show, who worked for Occupy Wall Street a year ago, so you're right, very suspicious.
[03:55:47.789 --> 03:55:59.623]  The other thing is, this whole Robert, this Confederate General Robert E. Lee, and this was the New York Times that reported this, by the way, not the Daily Stormer, he actually called slavery evil in a letter that he wrote.
[03:56:00.023 --> 03:56:03.064]  He freed black slaves on his own plantation.
[03:56:03.404 --> 03:56:12.587]  So, you know, I'm not saying he's a saint, but if that's the big racist, hateful icon that they want to tear down, again, it's a fundamental misunderstanding of history.
[03:56:12.967 --> 03:56:16.528]  I mean, Candice, again, it comes back to what Charles Barkley said.
[03:56:16.988 --> 03:56:19.789]  Why are they so enraged about 200-year-old statues?
[03:56:19.829 --> 03:56:22.549]  Because they're being told to be by the media.
[03:56:22.849 --> 03:56:24.930]  You called them out by name in your video.
[03:56:25.270 --> 03:56:26.370]  They're contriving this.
[03:56:26.450 --> 03:56:28.131]  They're fanning the flames of hysteria.
[03:56:28.971 --> 03:56:29.512]  Absolutely.
[03:56:29.592 --> 03:56:35.339]  And they are doing their best to create a race war because that will best serve them in the 2020 election.
[03:56:35.379 --> 03:56:36.801]  But I don't think it's going to work.
[03:56:36.861 --> 03:56:44.391]  And unfortunately, for people like you and I, you really don't even have to be super educated, just a little educated and think for yourself.
[03:56:45.091 --> 03:56:46.351]  And it's extremely, it's frustrating.
[03:56:46.391 --> 03:56:49.292]  It's frustrating to watch these sort of fake narratives.
[03:56:49.572 --> 03:56:53.673]  And then when you call out these fake narratives to be accused of being an Uncle Tom and a Coon, well, guess what?
[03:56:53.713 --> 03:56:54.913]  I've owned the word Coon now.
[03:56:54.973 --> 03:57:06.735]  My entire vlog series is entitled The Myth of the Coon because that word is a myth and it's meant to teach black people to hate people within their own race that have figured out the game, that have figured out the globalist game.
[03:57:06.795 --> 03:57:12.076]  That's why these words like Coon and Uncle Tom are the first things that are thrown at people like Dr. Ben Carson, who is,
[03:57:12.481 --> 03:57:15.163]  Extremely accomplished and someone that we should be celebrating.
[03:57:15.183 --> 03:57:21.049]  People like Condoleezza Rice, who's extremely accomplished and educated and someone that we should be celebrating, are basically told that they're not black.
[03:57:21.089 --> 03:57:23.131]  Our black hearts get stripped away for being educated.
[03:57:23.351 --> 03:57:24.031]  How sad is that?
[03:57:24.412 --> 03:57:27.514]  How enchained and enslaved are African-American minds?
[03:57:28.015 --> 03:57:29.016]  That is the result.
[03:57:29.076 --> 03:57:30.877]  Well, all groups do this.
[03:57:30.898 --> 03:57:34.281]  You know, back when I was successful in talk radio and I tried to build up other talk show hosts.
[03:57:35.321 --> 03:57:40.564]  I would learn that they would get mad and try to pull me down because they just didn't like somebody who was more successful.
[03:57:41.745 --> 03:57:49.830]  Once you transcend, it's not a race of people, we're all humans, kind of the loser group, then you get it's all about people that want to be successful and make others successful.
[03:57:50.090 --> 03:57:54.952]  And that's what's sad is they freeze people down these victim areas where they think that's their identity.
[03:57:55.273 --> 03:57:56.673]  No, your identity is not being a victim.
[03:57:57.174 --> 03:58:00.756]  If you've got a good attitude and you move forward, you're going to find other people that have a good attitude.
[03:58:00.956 --> 03:58:04.438]  You've got a bad attitude, I don't care what color you are, you're going to be unsuccessful.
[03:58:05.569 --> 03:58:06.490]  Absolutely, I agree.
[03:58:07.870 --> 03:58:08.671]  Paul, final comment?
[03:58:09.791 --> 03:58:11.192]  Yeah, we got about 30 seconds left.
[03:58:11.232 --> 03:58:14.234]  Candice, just tell people where they can find you on YouTube and Twitter.
[03:58:15.547 --> 03:58:19.508]  Uh, at redpillblack, at redpillblack on Instagram, the handle at redpillblack.
[03:58:19.648 --> 03:58:22.669]  It'll also just be kind of, uh, you know, personal stuff.
[03:58:23.070 --> 03:58:27.971]  Patreon if you want to donate so I can keep making videos, uh, patreon.com slash redpillblack.
[03:58:28.151 --> 03:58:29.252]  I want to see that explode.
[03:58:29.272 --> 03:58:32.033]  I want to see a hundred thousand people on there and please come back on with both of us.
[03:58:32.333 --> 03:58:33.553]  Paul, I'll talk to you right after the show.
[03:58:33.833 --> 03:58:34.794]  Thank you so much.
[03:58:34.814 --> 03:58:35.434]  Great to talk to you.
[03:58:35.474 --> 03:58:37.014]  Redpillblack, that's an amazing name.
[03:58:37.274 --> 03:58:37.735]  We'll be back.
[03:58:37.795 --> 03:58:38.415]  Stay with us.
[03:58:39.155 --> 03:58:40.075]  We got a lot more coming up.
[03:58:40.095 --> 03:58:41.276]  David Knight tomorrow, 8 a.m.
[03:58:45.740 --> 03:58:49.703]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
