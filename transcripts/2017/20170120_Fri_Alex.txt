[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:00.630]  We're good to go.
[00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:39.066]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:40.827]  Move, bitch!
[00:00:40.947 --> 00:00:42.227]  Get out of the way!
[00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:48.009]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag...
[00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.990]  The flag is the American flag!
[00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:54.714]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:57.936]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:00:57.956 --> 00:00:59.457]  I will not let you down.
[00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:02.479]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.160]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:06.322]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:11.846]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:14.148]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:15.669]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:19.742]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:19.782 --> 00:01:20.963]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:28.926]  As you can see behind me, we have a live feed of the inauguration in Washington, and we have our InfoWars crew live in Washington as well.
[00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:31.106]  We're going to go to Alex Jones right now.
[00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:34.468]  He is doing a live report from Washington, D.C.
[00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:35.468]  Here is Alex Jones.
[00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.474]  Now there's Alex and Roger Stone.
[00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:48.001]  This is the correct etiquette for the presidential swearing in according to Emily Post and the official manual.
[00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.483]  Roger Stone has a top hat.
[00:01:49.503 --> 00:01:51.384]  Last time I wore this is when I got married.
[00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.206]  Wow, this is called peacocking, my friend.
[00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:53.647]  Yes, indeed.
[00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:56.069]  If you don't do it now, when are you going to do it?
[00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.285]  My problem is a 22 inch neck and most of it's not fat, unfortunately, but I can't get a tie around my neck.
[00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:04.006]  Really?
[00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:05.108]  I know, it's very insulting.
[00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:06.329]  It's your look.
[00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.711]  I'm not meaning it.
[00:02:07.871 --> 00:02:08.953]  My jowls are my tie.
[00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:09.914]  It's your look.
[00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:11.296]  I guess it's my look, yeah.
[00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:15.600]  You know, you've been hit with polonium, but you've also had this big victory.
[00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:18.642]  Everything's, I guess, bittersweet.
[00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:19.783]  Best of time, worst of time.
[00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:22.125]  Just quick comments before we go in here.
[00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:30.532]  Well, the New York Times reports this morning that the Central Intelligence Agency has intercepts of communications between Trump campaign officials.
[00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:35.093]  And Russians, and among those listed is Roger Stone.
[00:02:35.214 --> 00:02:41.156]  I repeat again, this is unadulterated crap, falsehood, a lie.
[00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:48.959]  I'm anxious for the Senate Intelligence Committee to call me to testify in public so I can put this lie to rest once and for all.
[00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.680]  Now I want you to repeat this because this is so big, all the dots just connected.
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.121]  When he got hit with polonium months ago,
[00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:56.303]  CDC got with him weeks ago.
[00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:58.545]  We didn't know how to respond to this and put his book way behind.
[00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:01.889]  The media makes jokes about this, like, oh yeah, you're important.
[00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:02.790]  He's about to hit me with polonium.
[00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.934]  Meanwhile, dozens of Congress people are on TV.
[00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:06.674]  We've got clips of it.
[00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:11.480]  We put it on the show, saying he's the main guy between Russia and WikiLeaks, accusing him.
[00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:13.923]  I guess Putin gives you the info.
[00:03:14.523 --> 00:03:18.005]  And the term Crooked Hillary, and then you give it to Trump, totally made up!
[00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:21.807]  But then he gets to it with Polonium, and oh, he's not important, this didn't happen, it's no big deal.
[00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:33.432]  Meanwhile, just what you've surmised, after weeks of trying to figure it out, they were going to call him, but he would then rebuff it all, so they need him to be dead, and how do Russians kill their spies?
[00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:34.273]  Polonium!
[00:03:34.493 --> 00:03:42.497]  So you can see the whole setup, the whole script, but you didn't drink at all or something, you're still here, sometimes it takes a while to kill you, so we hope they've failed.
[00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:44.357]  But, I mean, Roger, this is amazing.
[00:03:44.377 --> 00:03:46.278]  So recap what you just said for everybody.
[00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:46.778]  Your statement.
[00:03:47.018 --> 00:04:03.342]  Well, today, page one, New York Times, says that the Central Intelligence Agency, the Deep State, who just won't give up flogging this horse, are claiming that they have intercepts of email communications and financial transactions between the Russians and the Trump campaign.
[00:04:03.882 --> 00:04:05.303]  By the way, what's crazy is
[00:04:31.787 --> 00:04:34.728]  All these foreign states have been caught trying to influence the election for Hillary.
[00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.229]  There's no proof of the Russians.
[00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.371]  And just like PPGate, or just like the Russians trying to turn off the power plants, remember that a few weeks ago?
[00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:42.612]  All of it's lies.
[00:04:42.712 --> 00:04:43.272]  Later they admit it.
[00:04:43.292 --> 00:04:44.432]  And I read the New York Times article.
[00:04:44.893 --> 00:04:51.435]  They always say maybe they have, or they kind of do, or well, you know, there's some of this chatter back and forth with no proof.
[00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:54.617]  So you see them leaving provisos in with their fake news.
[00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:56.998]  But unequivocally, have you talked to any Russians?
[00:04:57.358 --> 00:04:58.599]  I've talked to no Russians.
[00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:04.065]  I also have heard from no federal officials to inform me that I'm formally under investigation.
[00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:06.527]  And no one has come forward to ask me any questions.
[00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:08.890]  But I live for that moment.
[00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.372]  I can't wait for that moment.
[00:05:11.532 --> 00:05:15.516]  It's time to explode this entire narrative of lies.
[00:05:16.477 --> 00:05:17.298]  Who's saying this?
[00:05:17.938 --> 00:05:20.481]  Who's saying this on the front page of the New York Times?
[00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:34.293]  The people who lied about torture during the Iraq War, lied about Benghazi, lied about Iran-Contra, lied about Vietnam, lied about the Kennedy assassination, lied about Guatemala and Chile.
[00:05:34.474 --> 00:05:35.835]  What do they do at the CIA?
[00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:36.816]  They lie.
[00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:43.034]  And they've been caught lying about WMDs and the Vietnam War and torture and everything else.
[00:05:43.094 --> 00:05:47.699]  And they think, at least some of the elements in there, not the whole CIA, that this is their government and their country.
[00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:54.686]  And they're even openly threatening McCain, better watch what you do to the intelligence community, as if Trump's attacking the real intelligence community.
[00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:56.287]  No, he's going after liars.
[00:05:57.248 --> 00:05:57.989]  Like Clapper.
[00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:00.231]  And you know, liars... Like Brennan.
[00:06:00.311 --> 00:06:00.851]  Like Brennan.
[00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.894]  Brennan, warning the President of the United States to watch your mouth.
[00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:07.637]  No, I think he's the guy who ought to be investigated and prosecuted.
[00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:08.938]  CIA Director Brennan.
[00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:11.340]  The Saudi mole who runs the CIA.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.602]  Yeah, he better watch it.
[00:06:13.862 --> 00:06:14.463]  I would say so.
[00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:14.943]  Absolutely.
[00:06:14.963 --> 00:06:16.745]  All right, well in closing, we're about to go in here.
[00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:18.246]  Tell us about the significance of today.
[00:06:20.908 --> 00:06:24.292]  Today is a transformational period in American history.
[00:06:24.312 --> 00:06:28.817]  I think it was Alex Jones who said this is bigger than the Magna Carta, bigger than 1776.
[00:06:29.798 --> 00:06:34.202]  This is our last, best hope to save this country from globalism.
[00:06:34.703 --> 00:06:37.246]  And if America falls to globalism, the whole world doesn't.
[00:06:37.566 --> 00:06:40.668]  I had the New York Times again today asking me on ABC News, what's globalism?
[00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:42.210]  You know, like it doesn't exist.
[00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.854]  It's global corporate government that's fascist, that wants to pull up the ladder from everybody else and get rid of the middle class.
[00:06:48.054 --> 00:06:57.241]  It's in their own documents, it's in their own dossiers, it's in their own admissions that it's a worldwide corporate monopoly that wants to make the public poor and have population reduction.
[00:06:57.482 --> 00:06:59.523]  And you can argue, sure, there may be some overpopulation areas.
[00:06:59.723 --> 00:07:05.588]  The point is, we don't need some fascist corporate world government to carry it out, who have scripted themselves as world saviors.
[00:07:06.088 --> 00:07:08.088]  Okay, it's colonialism.
[00:07:08.148 --> 00:07:13.170]  Corporate colonialism over the individual, the family, the environment, everyone.
[00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:20.031]  And we're trying to make America great again, and the whole rest of the planet, and have a new age of trade, low taxes, and peace.
[00:07:20.131 --> 00:07:21.651]  Economic growth and peace.
[00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:25.132]  Today is a victory for the revolution.
[00:07:25.552 --> 00:07:26.152]  Let's get in there.
[00:07:26.272 --> 00:07:26.712]  All right, Roger.
[00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:27.752]  One more thing for your statement.
[00:07:27.772 --> 00:07:28.473]  This is so important.
[00:07:28.593 --> 00:07:29.693]  I mean, let's be clear.
[00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:33.314]  This is a bold new move for them to say they have communications with you talking to the Russians.
[00:07:33.614 --> 00:07:34.454]  This is horse manure.
[00:07:35.214 --> 00:07:35.915]  In your own words?
[00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:41.982]  Again, just to be clear, I have no Russian contacts, no Russian influences, no Russian money.
[00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:47.268]  I communicated with no Russians during this election or any previous election.
[00:07:47.328 --> 00:07:48.810]  Unadulterated crap.
[00:07:50.692 --> 00:07:51.553]  I don't know how much help.
[00:07:51.593 --> 00:07:52.794]  We talked to 45 the last week.
[00:07:52.814 --> 00:07:53.335]  He's been busy.
[00:07:53.355 --> 00:07:58.680]  But the protesters have been absolutely beating women in front of us, attacking us, blocking.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.742]  Throwing bottles of urine, throwing baggies.
[00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:02.063]  I mean, these are really horrible people.
[00:08:02.183 --> 00:08:02.604]  They're scum.
[00:08:02.804 --> 00:08:03.264]  They're scum.
[00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:05.406]  And the real question is, where was the D.C.
[00:08:05.447 --> 00:08:06.367]  Metropolitan Police?
[00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:09.370]  Where were their mounted cops with their nightsticks?
[00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.371]  And that was my next question.
[00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:11.392]  Do you think the D.C.
[00:08:11.432 --> 00:08:13.114]  Police would be a little better under Trump?
[00:08:13.134 --> 00:08:14.095]  But I guess he's not over them.
[00:08:14.175 --> 00:08:16.496]  Well, he needs to appoint somebody better to run.
[00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:20.199]  Remember, the District of Columbia is essentially run by the President of the United States.
[00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:22.580]  So it's time for a house playing in a new government era.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.423]  Well, we were told by police commanders that their bosses told them to stand down and let this happen.
[00:08:27.483 --> 00:08:29.124]  So that was Obama who ordered them to stand down.
[00:08:29.264 --> 00:08:29.504]  Yes.
[00:08:29.564 --> 00:08:31.526]  And that's over in about two hours.
[00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:32.266]  Last question.
[00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:37.629]  They've tried to fear-monger and say there could be drone bombs, attacks, don't go, all this.
[00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.212]  But seriously, with a lot of Democrats not showing up, now it's like 80-something.
[00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:46.098]  If there is a terror attack here, they need to be looked at as suspects for the fact that they weren't at the scene.
[00:08:46.538 --> 00:08:50.003]  Well, put it this way, if I do get whacked up there, I'm wearing the right outfit.
[00:08:50.203 --> 00:08:50.964]  Hey, exactly.
[00:08:51.084 --> 00:08:53.087]  As you're walking in here, tell me what your emotions are.
[00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:55.605]  Exhilaration.
[00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:56.705]  Excitement.
[00:08:57.365 --> 00:09:00.047]  This is a great, great, great day for America.
[00:09:00.527 --> 00:09:03.068]  I'm just glad to be a small piece of it.
[00:09:03.148 --> 00:09:04.089]  Talk about it, Roger.
[00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:04.589]  See you guys.
[00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:06.470]  Look at that great shot right there of the sun.
[00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.290]  Love you guys.
[00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:07.830]  InfoWars.com.
[00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.851]  We'll be back after the live show.
[00:09:15.939 --> 00:09:18.561]  Again, the big news story is that Obama ordered a stand-down of the police.
[00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:20.203]  That's it, actually.
[00:09:20.463 --> 00:09:23.126]  He ordered a stand-down of the Metro Police.
[00:09:23.486 --> 00:09:29.471]  We had the police telling multiple women who went and complained, do something, who were bleeding, that that's the case and that happened.
[00:09:29.711 --> 00:09:33.014]  This is a major scandal, and it just shows how far this country's fallen.
[00:09:33.054 --> 00:09:35.116]  We'll try to meet you here when you get out.
[00:09:35.437 --> 00:09:35.637]  Okay.
[00:09:35.837 --> 00:09:36.678]  Infowars.com.
[00:09:36.698 --> 00:09:37.839]  Now back to, who's hosting right now?
[00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:38.279]  Paul Watson?
[00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:39.220]  Probably Paul Watson.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.480]  All right.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:39.961]  Or David Knight?
[00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:40.181]  All right.
[00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:40.881]  Great job, guys.
[00:09:41.002 --> 00:09:41.282]  Love you.
[00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.791]  Alright, that's Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:46.292]  They're going into the inauguration.
[00:09:46.312 --> 00:09:51.334]  You see behind me we have live aerial shots of the massive crowd there at the inauguration.
[00:09:51.934 --> 00:09:54.515]  We've just seen the family of Donald Trump go in.
[00:09:54.555 --> 00:09:56.796]  There you can see some of them at this point right now.
[00:09:56.836 --> 00:09:58.577]  They're waiting for the inauguration to begin.
[00:09:58.677 --> 00:10:01.558]  And Alex Jones and Roger Stone were going in.
[00:10:01.578 --> 00:10:10.322]  And as they were pointing out, we're the police when this excrement is being thrown at people who are trying to come here and peacefully celebrate the transition of power.
[00:10:11.226 --> 00:10:23.675]  Well, they're not there, and as he pointed out, the NSA and others are now hurling their own excrement in their own way at Roger Stone, saying, you're a Russian agent, we have communications between you and the Russians, and he said, never happened.
[00:10:24.075 --> 00:10:25.897]  Never happened, I welcome the inquiry.
[00:10:26.457 --> 00:10:27.458]  And along that line...
[00:10:28.098 --> 00:10:35.783]  We've seen this war gaming put out by CNN yesterday, and of course they're the ones saying, well, you know, what happens if this whole thing gets shut down?
[00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:37.344]  You know, do we get to keep Obama?
[00:10:38.645 --> 00:10:39.986]  Who's the designated survivor?
[00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:42.188]  Or can Obama remain president?
[00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:49.193]  I want to play for you again this CNN report that's created so much stir from people saying, are you trying to provoke
[00:10:49.853 --> 00:10:57.280]  Some kind of a terrorist attack to make sure that you've got your own continuity, I guess we could call it, not continuity of government, continuity of Obama.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.941]  That's what they would love to have.
[00:10:59.222 --> 00:11:01.063]  They just don't want it to end.
[00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:05.847]  I mean, you go back and, again, before we go to this clip, think about this eight years ago.
[00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.731]  America the beautiful.
[00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.475]  This is the way ABC described the inauguration eight years ago.
[00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:11.496]  America the beautiful.
[00:11:11.917 --> 00:11:20.789]  The nation and the world pause to witness an extraordinary milestone as nearly two million people come together to hail the new chief and to celebrate an era of change.
[00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:24.126]  Now they don't like the change that's going to be coming with Donald Trump.
[00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.287]  So they want to shut it down.
[00:11:26.967 --> 00:11:27.988]  They don't want to talk about it.
[00:11:28.028 --> 00:11:30.930]  They don't want to give their opinions of why they're there protesting.
[00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.351]  They just want to shut it down.
[00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:34.452]  They just want to hurl their excrement at people.
[00:11:35.133 --> 00:11:38.395]  And that applies to the deep state as well.
[00:11:38.455 --> 00:11:44.599]  We should be very concerned about this continuity of government plan and the idea that CNN of all people
[00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:47.261]  Are pushing this report out there on everyone.
[00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:48.862]  Here's that report that CNN put together.
[00:11:49.162 --> 00:11:50.383]  The designated survivor.
[00:11:50.423 --> 00:11:53.145]  Who is the designated survivor at the inauguration?
[00:11:54.346 --> 00:12:05.956]  Just about every measure of America's security apparatus, including 28,000 law enforcement personnel, will be on the ground in Washington when President Obama hands off his office to Donald Trump on Friday.
[00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:12.381]  A near army in place to protect the leaders of all branches of government gathered in one place outside.
[00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:30.511]  And while officials stress there's no specific credible threat to this inauguration, tonight, due to a quirk in America's rules for succession, questions remain about just who would be in charge if an attack hit the incoming president, vice president, and congressional leaders just as the transfer of power is underway.
[00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:33.234]  Here you have a very confusing line of succession.
[00:12:33.354 --> 00:12:42.546]  According to the Constitution, if the President and Vice President are killed or incapacitated, next in line is the House Speaker, then the President Pro Tempore of the Senate.
[00:12:42.886 --> 00:12:45.309]  But what if something happened to them at the inauguration too?
[00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.393]  After that, it goes down the list of cabinet secretaries, starting with Secretary of State.
[00:12:50.853 --> 00:13:00.719]  On the day of the inauguration, as a precaution, a cabinet secretary called the designated presidential successor will not attend the inauguration, ready to step in if something happens.
[00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:05.022]  But it won't be a Trump cabinet secretary, since none of them have been confirmed yet.
[00:13:05.522 --> 00:13:07.243]  It will be an Obama appointee.
[00:13:07.683 --> 00:13:10.285]  No word from the White House on who that will be on Friday.
[00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:13.867]  Does the line of succession switch to the new president's lineup at noon?
[00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:16.970]  In the inauguration, you have two lines of succession.
[00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:27.542]  One for the Barack Obama administration, which is still in place, and one which really won't be in place until Donald Trump is inaugurated, comes into office and actually formally nominates and the Senate confirms his people.
[00:13:27.562 --> 00:13:32.047]  You might actually end up with a president from the prior administration because of a tragedy.
[00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:37.791]  Adding to the confusion, by noon Friday, all of Obama's cabinet secretaries are expected to resign.
[00:13:38.331 --> 00:13:45.195]  John Kerry, the current Secretary of State, would be the first cabinet secretary in the line of succession, but he's out of office by noon.
[00:13:45.596 --> 00:13:50.399]  Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, may not be confirmed for another week or two.
[00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:53.700]  So who would be Secretary of State on Friday afternoon?
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:03.104]  According to State Department sources, the job would fall to the highest-ranking non-political official in the department, the Undersecretary for Political Affairs, Tom Shannon.
[00:14:03.524 --> 00:14:17.869]  One of the most obscure possibilities is that someone who is an acting Secretary of State, someone lower down the line in the Secretary of State, State Department today, assumes the acting Secretary of State position, is in the line, and the worst happens, and that person becomes President, at least for a while.
[00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:23.102]  The uncertainty creates the potential for chaos, high theater, or a hit TV drama.
[00:14:23.644 --> 00:14:26.792]  Sir, you are now the President of the United States.
[00:14:28.517 --> 00:14:38.566]  In ABC's Designated Survivor, Kiefer Sutherland plays an obscure cabinet secretary, unexpectedly thrust into the presidency after an attack at the Capitol during a State of the Union address.
[00:14:38.966 --> 00:14:43.210]  Former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman once played that role in real life.
[00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.895]  In 1997, during an address by President Clinton to Congress, he was the Designated Survivor.
[00:14:49.335 --> 00:14:52.418]  He left Washington and went to his daughter's apartment in Manhattan.
[00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:53.839]  But he wasn't alone.
[00:14:54.339 --> 00:15:02.124]  The role is a serious one, and he says he was accompanied by a doctor, a military officer with access to the nuclear codes, and the Secret Service.
[00:15:02.504 --> 00:15:07.407]  But once the president's speech was over, Glickman declined a ride from his security detail.
[00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:09.048]  The security personnel left.
[00:15:09.388 --> 00:15:11.429]  Glickman had to hail a cab in bad weather.
[00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:21.816]  I couldn't escape the irony that three hours before, I had the potential of being the most powerful person on the face of the earth, and now I was in a situation where I couldn't even get a cab.
[00:15:23.243 --> 00:15:26.706]  Let's hope that that's the situation that Obama's in, but of course that's not going to be the situation.
[00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:28.628]  He's not going to have any problem getting a cab.
[00:15:28.668 --> 00:15:37.556]  He can afford a $22,000 a month rental there in Washington, D.C., but I would love to help him to move to another location.
[00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:43.021]  Speaking of Washington, D.C., we have Rob Dew in Washington as part of our live coverage.
[00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:43.841]  We have all of our
[00:15:44.802 --> 00:15:46.163]  Not all of our crew, but we have a lot of crew.
[00:15:46.203 --> 00:15:48.864]  We've got Liam McAdoo who's going to be joining us here in studio.
[00:15:49.104 --> 00:15:49.844]  I'm here in Austin.
[00:15:50.424 --> 00:15:53.526]  But we do have many people that are in Washington, D.C.
[00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:54.346]  to cover this live.
[00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:58.528]  You just saw Alex Jones and Roger Stone going into the inauguration.
[00:15:58.928 --> 00:16:01.189]  Rob Dew is at our Washington, D.C.
[00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:02.830]  temporary studio that we've set up there.
[00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.671]  Before we go to Rob, I just really want to remind you again
[00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:08.492]  That you can help to support InfoWars.
[00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:26.804]  Many of our most popular products at Infowars Life, 20 to 30% off.
[00:16:26.844 --> 00:16:32.589]  We've got 30% off Supermail Vitality, Brain Force Plus, 30% off, DNA Force, 10% off.
[00:16:32.609 --> 00:16:33.769]  That's now back in stock.
[00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.271]  It's been out of stock for quite some time.
[00:16:35.531 --> 00:16:37.412]  And of course, 10% on DNA Force is a huge discount.
[00:16:40.054 --> 00:16:51.318]  The reason it's been out of stock for well over a month is because it's so difficult to produce, so expensive to produce, and that's because of the Bio-PQQ and the form of Bio-PQQ that we get in it.
[00:16:51.358 --> 00:16:55.680]  It's difficult to find, very expensive to produce, so 10% is a big savings off of that.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.083]  And then we have 30% off Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, 20% off Secret 12, our Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:08.285]  And here's the new sale that we put in as part of the Trump Inauguration Special, and that is
[00:17:09.105 --> 00:17:13.468]  InfoWars selects storable food 30 to 40% off at InfoWars Store.
[00:17:13.508 --> 00:17:16.551]  That is a huge savings off of storable food.
[00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:18.472]  So take a look at those specials.
[00:17:18.492 --> 00:17:27.579]  Those are things that are useful for your family, useful for your health, and also it helps to support the InfoWars team that is on the ground in Washington, D.C.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.822]  And let's go to our team on the ground in Washington, D.C.
[00:17:30.902 --> 00:17:31.362]  Rob Dew.
[00:17:31.382 --> 00:17:32.243]  Thank you for joining us, Rob.
[00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:34.135]  Thank you, David.
[00:17:34.175 --> 00:17:36.377]  Rob Dewey reporting from Washington, D.C.
[00:17:36.477 --> 00:17:44.122]  Earlier today, I was on with Paul Joseph Watson at a large anti-Trump protest going on at Union Station.
[00:17:44.682 --> 00:17:47.965]  Now we have this to report, David, and we're going to go out and investigate this.
[00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:53.348]  We just came up here to get some equipment and refresh some batteries, but protesters smashed windows.
[00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:56.670]  Police used chemical spray to deal with crowds near Franklin Square.
[00:17:57.071 --> 00:17:58.552]  They smashed windows in a limo.
[00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:01.594]  Uh, at a Bank of America and a Starbucks.
[00:18:01.634 --> 00:18:10.380]  So, Utoy Capitalist type, uh, activity going on now, uh, to the, I would say probably to my west, southwest of me right now.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.442]  And we're gonna go check that out and see what's going on.
[00:18:12.462 --> 00:18:20.468]  Apparently, the police are pushing the protestable rioters at this point back using tear gas and, uh, I believe flash bang grenades.
[00:18:20.888 --> 00:18:30.831]  And of course we also had reports, we saw a video from Washington Examiner that protesters were blocking the inauguration checkpoints themselves, not allowing people to get in Black Lives Matter, disrupt J20.
[00:18:31.132 --> 00:18:37.594]  And I saw that report where you were there live on the street in the hour that Paul Joseph Watson was hosting.
[00:18:38.234 --> 00:18:40.794]  And what we're seeing there, Rob, is what we always see.
[00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:42.735]  They do not want to speak.
[00:18:43.135 --> 00:18:57.378]  They say this is all about free speech, and yet when you put a microphone in their face, I mean, how many people would love to give their opinion and have a worldwide audience that they could talk to and say, here's what we don't like, and yet they refuse to do it.
[00:18:57.498 --> 00:19:04.019]  They just chant slogans, or you found one guy that wanted to talk and then he was shut down by the leaders of the group because they don't want to tell people what they're about.
[00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:05.019]  They've got a hidden agenda.
[00:19:06.377 --> 00:19:07.478]  Yeah, it really is.
[00:19:07.578 --> 00:19:09.760]  It's just about, we're not going to work together with you.
[00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:12.063]  We're not going to try to work with you.
[00:19:12.083 --> 00:19:14.766]  And at the end, when we were still there, we shot some more video.
[00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:18.229]  The guy said it again, don't talk to him, don't engage him, don't engage him.
[00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.471]  I said, yeah, then we might find some common ground.
[00:19:21.152 --> 00:19:27.298]  And that's the issue, that we're never going to find common ground with the left and right coming together.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.540]  Until we start having more dialogue.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.141]  So that's what we're attempting to do.
[00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:37.002]  I was pretty, I think, respectful of them and their right to protest.
[00:19:37.022 --> 00:19:40.223]  But also, you know, I have some questions and I'd like to get some answers.
[00:19:40.243 --> 00:19:44.044]  So I don't see why that's such a problem with those groups.
[00:19:44.084 --> 00:19:44.884]  They never want to talk.
[00:19:44.904 --> 00:19:45.724]  They never want to engage.
[00:19:45.744 --> 00:19:47.604]  They want to yell insults.
[00:19:47.684 --> 00:19:48.545]  They want to scream.
[00:19:48.585 --> 00:19:49.605]  They want to flip you off.
[00:19:50.045 --> 00:19:52.125]  Put their fingers in front of the cameras.
[00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:54.266]  I mean, it's really childish behavior.
[00:19:54.426 --> 00:20:05.754]  Or they want to block the roads, and as I pointed out when I was talking in the last hour, I've got a poll up on my Twitter account in response to an article that was put out by The Intercept.
[00:20:05.854 --> 00:20:13.139]  They looked at five different states where Republicans have introduced bills to criminalize what they said is peaceful protest.
[00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:16.401]  What I would say is not peaceful protest, and that is blocking roads.
[00:20:16.761 --> 00:20:20.924]  You're gonna block roads, you're endangering not only your lives, but the lives of other people.
[00:20:21.144 --> 00:20:27.589]  Somebody stops because there's an accident, other people get rear-ended, they get injured, harmed, and they're also putting their lives at risk.
[00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:36.476]  So some of the states, they have proposed saying that they're not going to come after or prosecute anyone who accidentally kills protesters who are standing in the road.
[00:20:37.356 --> 00:20:42.760]  Also, they're going to increase fines or jail time for people who engage in that kind of disruptive activity.
[00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:43.861]  That's not speech!
[00:20:44.021 --> 00:20:46.063]  And as you saw there, when you're talking to these people,
[00:20:46.503 --> 00:20:52.328]  And we've seen it all throughout the election as they were getting violent at all the Trump rallies.
[00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:53.989]  They will never talk to you.
[00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:56.331]  All they will do is say racist, sexist, homophobe.
[00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:59.893]  I'd like to hear them even define those terms.
[00:20:59.973 --> 00:21:01.475]  You know, tell us what racism is.
[00:21:01.515 --> 00:21:04.657]  Is that somebody that can't see anything except skin color?
[00:21:04.717 --> 00:21:06.378]  That seems to be what these guys are.
[00:21:06.418 --> 00:21:07.279]  What is fascism?
[00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:12.303]  Is that somebody who just says, we're going to censor everything that you say, we're not going to let you speak, and we don't have anything to say ourselves?
[00:21:13.203 --> 00:21:17.944]  Well, and they call me a Nazi as well, like, you can't wait to speak out and go back to Germany.
[00:21:18.004 --> 00:21:20.405]  I said, well, that was actually the National Socialist Party.
[00:21:21.025 --> 00:21:21.925]  National Socialist, yes.
[00:21:21.945 --> 00:21:22.745]  That's what you're proposing.
[00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:24.626]  You have socialist on your sign, I don't.
[00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:26.286]  And I pointed that out to them.
[00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:41.130]  But it was funny, instead of engaging the chanting, the screaming, the shrill sounds they make, it's just, it's amazing that they've even, I think, got this far in life, because it's really, to me,
[00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:50.798]  It just shows you where we've come in the last 20 years with this enabling culture, where we enable everybody, and everybody's a genius and a precious snowflake.
[00:21:51.198 --> 00:21:55.542]  And so these people grow up just feeling that, you know, this way.
[00:21:55.562 --> 00:21:58.985]  They get their participation trophies and so forth and so on.
[00:21:59.525 --> 00:22:00.846]  Rob, we need to start telling them.
[00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:05.170]  They're all getting together and huddling together and saying, we're going to be OK, we're going to be OK.
[00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.211]  And we need to tell them, no, you're not going to be OK.
[00:22:07.532 --> 00:22:15.818]  As long as you think that you get a participation trophy out of life for doing nothing, as long as you have absolutely nothing to say but you want to shut down other people's free speech, you're not going to be OK.
[00:22:16.439 --> 00:22:17.820]  You don't have the tools to live and life.
[00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:19.639]  Exactly.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.882]  And that's what we're witnessing with this younger generation that they're coming to grips with.
[00:22:22.922 --> 00:22:24.023]  And some people really get it.
[00:22:24.303 --> 00:22:28.826]  I've met some young kids from high school here that really get what's going on, and they understand.
[00:22:29.126 --> 00:22:34.550]  Even a lot of their families, they were not Trump supporters and did not vote for Trump, but they were here to support Trump.
[00:22:35.551 --> 00:22:36.972]  And they gave it all the reasons.
[00:22:37.012 --> 00:22:38.113]  We've got to secure our border.
[00:22:38.393 --> 00:22:39.213]  We need more jobs.
[00:22:39.233 --> 00:22:43.076]  We need to work on our economy first instead of giving money to the rest of the world.
[00:22:43.676 --> 00:22:45.117]  We don't need as much war for no reason.
[00:22:45.138 --> 00:22:45.678]  We don't need to arm ISIS.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.121]  You know, a lot of these kids really get it.
[00:22:50.361 --> 00:22:52.962]  And a lot of people are Alex Jones fans.
[00:22:53.002 --> 00:22:56.824]  We shot a pretty amazing video last night walking up to the Capitol.
[00:22:57.524 --> 00:23:05.087]  And, you know, it was just... Alex was overcome with the spirit, I guess, of liberty and freedom several times.
[00:23:05.128 --> 00:23:07.449]  And he had to just hand the mic off and walk away.
[00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:08.849]  And he was, you know, crying.
[00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.351]  I think he's just, you know, pretty overwhelmed with everything that's going on right now.
[00:23:13.431 --> 00:23:15.132]  And especially the people coming up to him.
[00:23:15.612 --> 00:23:16.233]  And just with this...
[00:23:17.253 --> 00:23:19.576]  You know, kind of devotion, like thank you type devotion.
[00:23:19.616 --> 00:23:20.637]  Like, thank you for doing this.
[00:23:20.677 --> 00:23:21.758]  Thank you for sacrificing.
[00:23:21.798 --> 00:23:23.981]  Thank you for putting your name on the line.
[00:23:24.001 --> 00:23:26.043]  And people were thanking us all throughout the day.
[00:23:26.063 --> 00:23:27.705]  So it was really nice to see that.
[00:23:28.346 --> 00:23:31.209]  And, you know, the protesters really haven't been as big.
[00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.732]  We're going to go out and see if we can find more of these little incidents.
[00:23:35.253 --> 00:23:37.615]  I think it's going to be smaller than they think.
[00:23:37.655 --> 00:23:40.657]  They say, oh, we've got protests happening all day, we're going to be there.
[00:23:41.038 --> 00:23:41.958]  But I don't know.
[00:23:42.018 --> 00:23:42.599]  I don't buy it.
[00:23:43.099 --> 00:23:46.722]  I think that the spirit of Trump is repelling them.
[00:23:46.802 --> 00:23:47.522]  That's what I think.
[00:23:47.542 --> 00:23:54.047]  Well, you know, it's the sort of thing that conservatives, when they lose, they don't think to take to the street and shut everything down and protest people.
[00:23:54.087 --> 00:23:57.049]  So there weren't that many protesters probably at the Obama administration.
[00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.050]  We wouldn't have known.
[00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.371]  Because the mainstream media wouldn't have covered it.
[00:24:00.632 --> 00:24:07.697]  But what we're going to see, because the mainstream media are protesting Donald Trump, and they're the ones who have the voice, we're going to see that a lot.
[00:24:08.037 --> 00:24:12.260]  But one of the things that we did in the last hour... Well, they'll probably blame Trump for these broken windows, David.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:12.721]  That's right.
[00:24:12.841 --> 00:24:13.441]  Oh no, it's his fault.
[00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:14.362]  On the Washington Post article.
[00:24:14.722 --> 00:24:15.403]  It's his fault.
[00:24:15.443 --> 00:24:16.343]  That's going to be his fault.
[00:24:16.363 --> 00:24:19.746]  See, you had your inauguration in DC, and look what people did.
[00:24:19.926 --> 00:24:21.787]  It'll be Donald Trump's Kristallnacht.
[00:24:22.408 --> 00:24:22.528]  Yeah.
[00:24:24.206 --> 00:24:24.967]  That'll be the headline.
[00:24:25.368 --> 00:24:36.343]  Yeah, Rob, we played Give Peace a Chance, the chants by John Lennon and others, because I thought it was such an amazing thing to see these people.
[00:24:36.964 --> 00:24:41.170]  One article they were talking about a guy, he said, last time I did a protest, I went to New York,
[00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.411]  Uh, and protest the Vietnam War.
[00:24:43.471 --> 00:24:48.173]  Now I'm 73 years old, I'm retired, I'm in Asheville, North Carolina, and I'm coming here to protest this again.
[00:24:48.414 --> 00:24:50.134]  It's like, just give peace a chance, guys.
[00:24:50.515 --> 00:24:51.155]  Let's just do that.
[00:24:51.175 --> 00:24:56.938]  You know, there's an editorial from, uh, Pat Buchanan on WND, and he said George Kennan himself
[00:24:57.418 --> 00:25:05.063]  Who is the architect of the Cold War containment of Stalin's Russia, warned us not to move NATO to Russia's border.
[00:25:05.324 --> 00:25:17.312]  And yet you've got all of these hippies, all of these Hollywood figures like Robert De Niro, calling out Putin, joining with the military-industrial complex that they've told us for decades that they oppose.
[00:25:17.552 --> 00:25:23.997]  Now they're joining with the military-industrial complex to push the neo-Cold War, to push us into a confrontation with Russia.
[00:25:24.337 --> 00:25:26.859]  I just want to say to these people, hey, go back and listen to John Lennon.
[00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:28.281]  And give peace a chance.
[00:25:28.321 --> 00:25:31.607]  Give Donald Trump a chance and listen to what he has to say.
[00:25:31.967 --> 00:25:33.751]  See what he does as a president.
[00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.391]  I'm actually shocked that they are supporting this.
[00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:46.074]  The left is usually the anti-war group that always protests war, but they are like ravenous about going after Russia for some reason.
[00:25:46.174 --> 00:25:54.958]  And I think it just stems from the mainstream media's ravenous appetite because MSNBC's owned by GE, CNN's owned by globalist Ted Turner.
[00:25:55.318 --> 00:25:58.619]  These people like war because war fits into their agenda.
[00:25:58.959 --> 00:26:03.902]  It's always been a tool of the establishment, and these people are shills for the establishment.
[00:26:04.382 --> 00:26:11.607]  And the global establishment is both Republican and Democrat at the top, as you well know, and we've talked about this over and over again.
[00:26:11.967 --> 00:26:20.292]  These people, the Hollywood people, the press, are joining with that global establishment, that military-industrial-academic complex.
[00:26:20.492 --> 00:26:22.433]  They're joining with them to push Cold War.
[00:26:22.773 --> 00:26:24.394]  They don't want to give peace a chance.
[00:26:24.434 --> 00:26:26.756]  That's really the saddest thing about all this.
[00:26:26.996 --> 00:26:28.497]  And when we see Donald Trump
[00:26:28.937 --> 00:26:30.078]  Moving against NATO.
[00:26:30.138 --> 00:26:39.183]  The reasons he's saying that, Rob, is because he and we know that NATO has been totally ineffective in terms of countering terrorist threats to us.
[00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:50.030]  And it's been the globalists who have been enhancing that terrorist threat, creating wars throughout the Middle East, setting it on fire with their regime changes, and then bringing people in from those areas who are
[00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:55.955]  If they're not terrorists already, they're easily radicalized once they get into America, and there's no background checks.
[00:26:55.975 --> 00:26:59.838]  We don't know who's a refugee and who is an ISIS terrorist when they're bringing it in.
[00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:00.699]  That's the threat.
[00:27:00.899 --> 00:27:08.586]  NATO is absolutely useless on that, and even if it were useful, most of the people that are, most of the countries that are involved in that are not paying anything to support it.
[00:27:09.915 --> 00:27:10.756]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:14.258]  And I had an interesting conversation with a British journalist last night.
[00:27:14.298 --> 00:27:15.939]  I put that up on the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:21.642]  And she was telling me how great Brexit was and how people weren't going to work together if they don't have the European Union.
[00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:23.123]  That was the only way to keep peace.
[00:27:23.803 --> 00:27:30.788]  And I was sitting there trying to explain to her, you can still have deals with, you know, England can make deals with every country in Europe and still
[00:27:31.872 --> 00:27:49.887]  It'd be almost the same way, almost unnoticeable, except you wouldn't have an open border, you wouldn't have to set yourself up for these different trade deals that the EU negotiates, which are usually bad for Britain because they have one of the best economies, them and Germany end up propping everyone else up.
[00:27:50.327 --> 00:27:53.370]  And so it doesn't allow you to look at things on a level playing field.
[00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.331]  It's always stilted.
[00:27:54.371 --> 00:28:00.536]  It's always, you know, let Brussels, this unelected group of people, tell everybody else how to live.
[00:28:01.036 --> 00:28:01.557]  Exactly.
[00:28:01.577 --> 00:28:05.179]  And a good example of that, Rob, is an article I was looking at the other day.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:17.369]  They were talking about, it was a car publication, and they were talking about, look, we're going to have massive tariffs on German motorcycles coming into this country because of wheat.
[00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:41.285]  And so you get into this complicated situation where because the EU is negotiating this as a bloc, as a group, because one country successfully lobbies and gets one of our industries shut down, then that's going to have repercussions in something that is totally unrelated, like motorcycles not being able to come into America without massive tariffs on it.
[00:28:42.426 --> 00:28:50.733]  But if we were dealing one-on-one with individual countries, it would be much more rational in terms of the negotiations that we have.
[00:28:50.753 --> 00:28:59.140]  And it would be much easier to do that, rather than trying to negotiate with this massive entity that's got all these conflicting interests going on at the same time.
[00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:10.254]  Yes, and bottom line is the money you spend on joining those groups and being in them, you can create your cabinet of trade ministers and stuff like that to work with each individual country, just like we have ambassadors.
[00:29:10.594 --> 00:29:12.235]  It's something, it's a system we already have set up.
[00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:13.876]  I think it's fairly easy to do.
[00:29:14.316 --> 00:29:18.778]  So, you know, I'm glad we're not, with Donald Trump, hopefully we're not going to see a TPP.
[00:29:19.118 --> 00:29:23.080]  We're not going to see those things and we're just going to make America great again and we're about to celebrate.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:23.461]  It's about
[00:29:24.636 --> 00:29:25.677]  About half an hour away now.
[00:29:25.737 --> 00:29:26.197]  I'm very excited.
[00:29:26.218 --> 00:29:26.538]  That's right.
[00:29:26.658 --> 00:29:34.465]  We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back from the break, we're going to have Leanne McAdoo joining us for our live coverage of the inauguration of President Trump.
[00:29:35.426 --> 00:29:36.147]  Hold that thought.
[00:29:36.287 --> 00:29:36.928]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.869 --> 00:29:53.612]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:29:53.812 --> 00:30:00.937]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:30:01.117 --> 00:30:03.539]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[00:30:03.979 --> 00:30:05.720]  And I started to try to eat healthy.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.400]  Started taking third-party supplements.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.601]  Started seeing some more gains.
[00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:20.464]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:30:20.664 --> 00:30:20.944]  Boom!
[00:30:21.344 --> 00:30:22.764]  Weight started pouring off.
[00:30:22.884 --> 00:30:24.765]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:30:25.245 --> 00:30:26.405]  Then, by early 2016,
[00:30:28.466 --> 00:30:31.808]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:30:31.828 --> 00:30:32.909]  But the election heated up.
[00:30:32.969 --> 00:30:35.351]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:44.717]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:30:44.937 --> 00:30:45.878]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:30:46.058 --> 00:30:49.741]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:56.610]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.012]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:30:58.052 --> 00:31:01.617]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:31:03.507 --> 00:31:05.268]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:31:05.668 --> 00:31:07.169]  I'm religiously taking the products.
[00:31:07.589 --> 00:31:10.250]  And in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:31:10.591 --> 00:31:17.054]  I've lost five pounds, religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:31:17.474 --> 00:31:17.994]  It's amazing.
[00:31:18.295 --> 00:31:20.656]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:31:20.956 --> 00:31:23.637]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:31:23.837 --> 00:31:26.419]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:31:27.099 --> 00:31:31.081]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:31:31.221 --> 00:31:32.422]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:31:33.885 --> 00:31:37.006]  And quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:31:37.447 --> 00:31:38.707]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:31:39.327 --> 00:31:46.730]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:31:46.851 --> 00:31:47.431]  It's incredible.
[00:31:48.391 --> 00:31:50.312]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:31:50.552 --> 00:31:51.533]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:31:51.933 --> 00:31:54.354]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:31:54.954 --> 00:31:55.834]  This is an experiment.
[00:31:55.954 --> 00:31:56.695]  Everybody's watching.
[00:31:56.935 --> 00:31:57.775]  We'll see what happens.
[00:31:58.215 --> 00:31:59.056]  This is Part 2.
[00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:03.809]  Well, here we are.
[00:32:03.849 --> 00:32:04.950]  Another week has passed.
[00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:17.642]  If memory serves, I lost five pounds the first week, three pounds the next, and only one pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[00:32:17.682 --> 00:32:19.623]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[00:32:20.084 --> 00:32:23.027]  I've lost a pound, so we're now up to nine pounds.
[00:32:24.028 --> 00:32:28.209]  And I've only got, you know, a week and a half left or so until we see what happens in this experiment.
[00:32:28.229 --> 00:32:29.850]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:31.931]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[00:32:32.791 --> 00:32:37.472]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[00:32:38.013 --> 00:32:40.473]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[00:32:40.593 --> 00:32:42.174]  Let's see what happens next week.
[00:32:51.256 --> 00:32:52.819]  Make America Great Again!
[00:33:13.419 --> 00:33:19.534]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:21.419]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.499 --> 00:33:24.780]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.802]  I'm David Knight, and joining me in the studio is Leanne McAdoo.
[00:33:27.822 --> 00:33:32.085]  We're giving you the live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration.
[00:33:32.105 --> 00:33:36.507]  Of course, this is a time for people who are on the winning side to celebrate.
[00:33:36.728 --> 00:33:45.393]  And it's a time for the entire country, typically, to celebrate the fact that we can have a peaceful transition of power, even from one side to the other.
[00:33:45.613 --> 00:33:50.717]  Radical change in policies has always been done peacefully, and yet this time, we see the same press
[00:33:51.337 --> 00:33:59.924]  That always is gushing about how beautiful, how wonderful, how special this transition of power is or how beautiful the day is and so forth and so on.
[00:34:00.184 --> 00:34:03.467]  Now all they do is focus on the demonstrators.
[00:34:03.487 --> 00:34:04.427]  So we're going to focus here.
[00:34:04.447 --> 00:34:14.836]  We're going to tell you what's happening with the demonstrators because that is a big part of the story that we have our crew focusing on there because we need to understand these people do not want a peaceful transition of power.
[00:34:15.276 --> 00:34:17.096]  They don't want to have speech either.
[00:34:17.156 --> 00:34:18.737]  They don't want to exercise their free speech.
[00:34:18.797 --> 00:34:21.377]  As Rob Dew engaged them and said, tell us why you're here.
[00:34:21.497 --> 00:34:23.858]  Well, he's racist and he's a fascist.
[00:34:23.938 --> 00:34:27.278]  And it's like, then they were shut down by the people that don't talk.
[00:34:27.698 --> 00:34:31.039]  You know, don't express to people what your political opinion is.
[00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:38.680]  Even when you have a microphone in your face, you have a massive soapbox, don't tell people what you're about.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.341]  Because if you hear what these people truly want,
[00:34:41.821 --> 00:34:49.627]  You were going to run very quickly in the opposite direction and that's of course what people have done as they saw these protests in the lead up to the election, didn't they Leanne?
[00:34:50.127 --> 00:34:52.328]  Absolutely, and it's kind of interesting actually.
[00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:53.890]  I want to talk a little bit about those optics.
[00:34:54.250 --> 00:35:08.460]  They're not really focusing on these protesters and the fact that they are out there blockading all of the checkpoints and there's like rope chains of these protesters using their bodies to stop people from entering the inauguration.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:21.687]  And so earlier you saw on I guess I think we were watching CNN in there and they were showing the size of the crowd and how small it was and just talking about when Obama was here you know that the crowd was ten times the size.
[00:35:21.967 --> 00:35:32.352]  They're not showing you what's happening at all the entry points to get in to where people can be a part of this inauguration and that it's being blocked off by these violent fascist protesters.
[00:35:32.432 --> 00:35:35.454]  So the useful idiots at the bottom keep people from getting in.
[00:35:37.115 --> 00:35:42.498]  People are obviously also concerned about having excrement thrown at them by these people, as they've claimed that they're going to do.
[00:35:42.538 --> 00:35:46.500]  But when they block the entrance to this and bunch that up, and the D.C.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:51.423]  police don't do anything about it, then the news media comes in and forwards out this agenda.
[00:35:51.543 --> 00:35:52.484]  Look, nobody showed up.
[00:35:52.564 --> 00:35:54.325]  And it's like, no, there's going to be a lot of people there.
[00:35:54.605 --> 00:35:55.926]  They're a very small number of people.
[00:35:56.046 --> 00:35:59.188]  Even by their own projections, USA Today would say, well, we expect 900,000 people.
[00:35:59.208 --> 00:35:59.568]  They don't know.
[00:36:01.209 --> 00:36:02.371]  They don't know how many people are going to show up.
[00:36:02.411 --> 00:36:05.374]  And then Huffington Post says, we expect 25,000 protesters.
[00:36:05.474 --> 00:36:07.356]  Again, they don't know how many protesters are going to show up.
[00:36:07.396 --> 00:36:10.740]  But if you look at those very numbers, you see that's less than 3% of the people.
[00:36:11.081 --> 00:36:16.387]  Those 3%, though, are going to be trying to stop the other 97% from being able to attend.
[00:36:16.407 --> 00:36:17.548]  That's their whole point.
[00:36:18.089 --> 00:36:21.310]  They're getting out there, they're blocking roads in so many different ways.
[00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:28.013]  That's become the method of protest for these Marxists, for the Black Lives Matter people, for the Soros surrogates.
[00:36:28.933 --> 00:36:40.998]  So much so, Leanne, that lawmakers in five states have now said, we're not going to hold motorists responsible if they accidentally even kill somebody on these highways because they are endangering lives and they don't want to exercise their free speech.
[00:36:41.038 --> 00:36:42.038]  I can't repeat that enough.
[00:36:42.438 --> 00:36:46.340]  This is not a situation like we have at the presidential nominating conventions.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:37:00.089]  Which has been going on for the last several cycles, where they take people who want to peacefully protest, who want to speak, and they put them in cages, way down in a remote location, away from the site of the actual convention, Democrat and Republican.
[00:37:00.389 --> 00:37:06.193]  That is an egregious abridgment of the ability to redress your grievances and to meet in public.
[00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:11.577]  But you do not have a right to riot, to burn down things, to create hazards on the roads,
[00:37:12.617 --> 00:37:16.798]  Lock down the DC Metro so there can be no traffic going in and out of the city.
[00:37:16.838 --> 00:37:20.279]  I mean, that's their main artery of how they get around in DC.
[00:37:20.299 --> 00:37:21.419]  So you're going to shut that down?
[00:37:22.019 --> 00:37:23.660]  That's incredible.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.120]  And of course, here and now, we're seeing that they're doing another prayer.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:35.642]  I guess Donald Trump's whole inaugural ceremony has featured more prayer than the last few inaugurations that people have seen.
[00:37:35.662 --> 00:37:37.182]  Well, there's five or six different people.
[00:37:37.222 --> 00:37:38.423]  They're trying to make it inclusive.
[00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:42.346]  The Muslims are not having any of that.
[00:37:42.366 --> 00:37:53.998]  We had the Council on American Islamic Relations care, which has been tied to funding Hamas and other terrorist organizations, and they came out and said, we demand that Franklin Graham
[00:37:54.801 --> 00:37:58.344]  Not be allowed to offer a prayer at the inauguration.
[00:37:58.524 --> 00:37:59.445]  It's like, well, guess what?
[00:37:59.585 --> 00:38:00.305]  We demand.
[00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:04.849]  CARE is not going to get their demands met anymore because we really don't care what CARE wants.
[00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:07.971]  We care less what CARE's demands are.
[00:38:08.031 --> 00:38:10.273]  So he's going to be offering a prayer.
[00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:12.455]  That was not Franklin Graham, of course, there.
[00:38:12.495 --> 00:38:13.496]  That was someone else.
[00:38:14.156 --> 00:38:19.177]  And we now have, as you can see in the video feed here, we're going to carry Donald Trump's speech live.
[00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:26.239]  There you see the article about CARE demanding that Franklin Graham not be allowed to speak at the convention.
[00:38:26.259 --> 00:38:30.080]  And you know, it's interesting too, because I go back and I look at Obama.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:37.162]  It really struck me that one of the first things he did in April 2009, shortly after becoming president, he goes to Georgetown University.
[00:38:38.042 --> 00:38:40.784]  And he gives a speech at a formerly Christian university.
[00:38:40.844 --> 00:38:43.907]  So they had, it was in the chapel there, where they had Christian symbols.
[00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:45.928]  And there was something up there that was IHS.
[00:38:46.008 --> 00:38:49.230]  It's not anything that, it was a reference to Jesus.
[00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:52.293]  And I don't, it's not the church that I come from.
[00:38:52.333 --> 00:38:53.514]  I don't know what that was in reference to.
[00:38:53.754 --> 00:38:57.597]  But it was so offensive to him, even though it was fairly obscure for a lot of Christians.
[00:38:57.617 --> 00:39:00.599]  A lot of evangelical Protestant Christians would not know what that means.
[00:39:01.099 --> 00:39:02.981]  But he demanded that that be covered up.
[00:39:03.706 --> 00:39:04.767]  With plywood.
[00:39:04.807 --> 00:39:06.828]  And they complied with that.
[00:39:06.908 --> 00:39:09.009]  They did that.
[00:39:09.049 --> 00:39:10.189]  They covered up those symbols.
[00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:20.175]  And yet later on he goes to speak at a mosque and they've got these stained glass windows up that had all this stuff in Arabic.
[00:39:20.455 --> 00:39:22.015]  And he didn't have a problem with that.
[00:39:22.035 --> 00:39:22.616]  That was fine.
[00:39:22.716 --> 00:39:23.316]  That was fine.
[00:39:23.436 --> 00:39:23.936]  That was fine.
[00:39:24.137 --> 00:39:24.357]  Yeah.
[00:39:24.577 --> 00:39:24.737]  Yeah.
[00:39:25.217 --> 00:39:28.341]  Well, definitely the symbolism is not lost on us.
[00:39:28.501 --> 00:39:30.343]  And you know what I think is also very interesting?
[00:39:30.924 --> 00:39:35.809]  This particular feed that we have up, it's just kind of straight on there and then every once in a while they'll go to the side.
[00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:44.779]  I know on the right side broadcasting network, their feed has a different angle and so you could actually see Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton off to the side.
[00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:46.221]  They're standing right there next to Michelle.
[00:39:46.781 --> 00:40:01.991]  And she is just trying so hard to keep it together, to appear gracious, but she's getting snubbed by quite a few people who are just not shaking her hand or just kind of giving her a little nod and stuff, and you can see she's going, I have no power anymore.
[00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:08.196]  Like, it's just really, I think they're just giving her some mercy here by not pointing the camera on her.
[00:40:08.216 --> 00:40:10.477]  She was overwhelmingly rejected by the American people.
[00:40:10.557 --> 00:40:11.258]  If you take away
[00:40:12.085 --> 00:40:18.931]  Her huge fan base in New York and California, she lost by a massive amount to Donald Trump from the rest of the country.
[00:40:18.951 --> 00:40:26.098]  That's one of the reasons why we want to keep the Electoral College, because we do not want to have two cities and two states determine who the next president is.
[00:40:26.158 --> 00:40:30.321]  But of course, there's a lot of talk about Hillary Clinton becoming mayor of New York.
[00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.963]  You know, will she become the Queen of Queens?
[00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:33.905]  Or will they give her the Bronx cheer?
[00:40:34.225 --> 00:40:36.147]  Let's vote for the Bronx cheer.
[00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:40.409]  But that may be what she's going to do.
[00:40:40.489 --> 00:40:43.691]  I hope that she just goes away or gets prosecuted.
[00:40:43.731 --> 00:40:44.772]  That's really what should happen.
[00:40:45.072 --> 00:40:52.876]  We should have the next Justice Department come in and take a look at the Clinton Foundation because what happened there, folks, is a crime.
[00:40:53.176 --> 00:41:05.883]  And as we're talking about these whistleblowers, and we're talking about Manning, we're talking about Snowden, we're talking about Julian Assange, as I said before, when the government comes in and they want to shut down a massive criminal organization like the Clinton Foundation, okay,
[00:41:06.583 --> 00:41:09.364]  Uh, a organized crime organization.
[00:41:09.744 --> 00:41:16.287]  They'll get people, even people who have killed other people, even hit men, and get them to become state witnesses and give them immunity.
[00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:27.912]  So if you say that somebody died, say because of some information that was released by Manning, I don't know if that's true or not, but even if that were true, wouldn't you want to know
[00:41:28.712 --> 00:41:30.733]  What was revealed with those leaks.
[00:41:30.833 --> 00:41:37.015]  We found some very important criminal actions of Hillary Clinton's State Department well before what happened with this.
[00:41:37.095 --> 00:41:40.597]  Just from those, and I think that's instructive as to how that information gets out.
[00:41:40.897 --> 00:41:44.038]  I think the same thing happened with the DNC that happened with Manning.
[00:41:44.559 --> 00:41:49.180]  Somebody inside, that's what we were told by the ambassador who took that stuff, he said it wasn't Russians hacking.
[00:41:49.621 --> 00:41:56.844]  I went to America, I met with someone in the park from the DNC that was angry about how they had hacked the election.
[00:41:57.084 --> 00:41:57.764]  And rigged it against
[00:41:57.844 --> 00:41:58.444]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:42:28.124 --> 00:42:30.186]  I thought this was this great organization, so.
[00:42:30.727 --> 00:42:32.969]  Yeah, that will be, and what do we have going on here?
[00:42:33.009 --> 00:42:35.712]  We still, now we have a choir that is singing here.
[00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:38.014]  I'm waiting for the underdog balloon to come out.
[00:42:47.196 --> 00:42:50.018]  Okay, so this is the prelude to the actual swearing-in.
[00:42:50.038 --> 00:42:54.960]  And of course, Donald Trump will not become president until noon.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.423]  That is when the official handover of power is scheduled to take place.
[00:42:59.943 --> 00:43:05.146]  And so we're going to be carrying his speech as well as that swearing-in live, and we're going to be going to this feed periodically.
[00:43:05.796 --> 00:43:14.687]  Can you believe all of the mainstream media, CNN, having that hypothetical scenario of what would happen if someone was to take Donald Trump out?
[00:43:14.847 --> 00:43:22.436]  Some tragedy were to occur before the oath wearing and how kind of excited they were that it would be an Obama appointee.
[00:43:23.477 --> 00:43:33.083]  Well, they want continuity of Obama, they want their safe place in Washington, D.C., and they're just fantasizing and fulfilling out their fantasies that Obama could remain.
[00:43:33.103 --> 00:43:37.926]  But there's something about that that is far more troubling when we understand how the deep state operates.
[00:43:39.307 --> 00:43:41.988]  With Alex Jones and Roger Stone talking.
[00:43:42.048 --> 00:43:51.290]  Now we've got some information that's just been released saying that the NSA has evidence that Roger Stone talked to the Russians and Roger Stone said, never happened.
[00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:52.210]  It didn't happen.
[00:43:52.331 --> 00:43:53.551]  I welcome the investigation.
[00:43:54.151 --> 00:43:57.332]  They've made these charges before and now it's coming from
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:08.007]  The intelligence agency, the Deep State, and of course they would never fabricate anything for people that is not true.
[00:44:08.047 --> 00:44:12.330]  They would never try to overthrow our own government, just as they would never try to do that abroad.
[00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:15.892]  Look, they hid the fact for a long time that they were overthrowing governments abroad.
[00:44:16.152 --> 00:44:18.994]  They hid the fact for a long time that they were assassinating leaders abroad.
[00:44:19.254 --> 00:44:20.135]  Now they do it openly.
[00:44:21.013 --> 00:44:25.537]  And so of course they're going to do the same thing here and it won't be long before they will do it openly here.
[00:44:25.758 --> 00:44:26.819]  Right.
[00:44:26.879 --> 00:44:38.310]  If you want to see that fact and actual intelligence documents, they just released 12 million of them from the 40s, 50s, 60s where they talk about overthrowing foreign governments as well as a lot of
[00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:39.231]  We're good to go.
[00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.915]  Hastily working on creating one that can do just that.
[00:45:03.136 --> 00:45:03.296]  Yeah.
[00:45:03.656 --> 00:45:12.450]  Well, I think it's very telling, too, that on the, I think, what was it, 56 years ago that Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex.
[00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:15.654]  And there he is talking to the military-industrial complex at Davos.
[00:45:16.215 --> 00:45:27.383]  The globalist military-industrial complex, and warning them about threats to their power, just as Eisenhower warned the American people about threats to our sovereignty, about threats to our freedom.
[00:45:27.944 --> 00:45:33.148]  And of course, we're going to have, I guess the swearing is going to take place first, and then there's going to be the speech.
[00:45:33.188 --> 00:45:41.974]  And we're really only about 14 minutes away from that happening, in terms of, it's going to be noon Eastern, so it's only about 14-15 minutes away.
[00:45:44.096 --> 00:45:47.380]  Have we got any word of where Alex Jones is in that crowd?
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.123]  I know he was... No, we don't know where Alex is.
[00:45:50.143 --> 00:45:50.964]  Where's Waldo?
[00:45:50.984 --> 00:45:54.228]  If anyone wants to zoom in and have a little bit of fun, he's there somewhere.
[00:45:54.801 --> 00:46:01.448]  Well, according to the mainstream media, there's nobody there, so it shouldn't be hard to find them, but no, there's a lot of people there.
[00:46:01.528 --> 00:46:17.744]  Yeah, they're finally kind of zooming out, and it was back by the Lincoln Memorial earlier where they were really focusing in on how empty the Lincoln Memorial was, and it's like, yeah, why don't you focus on the chains of protesters there that are violently using their bodies to stop people from entering?
[00:46:18.064 --> 00:46:36.754]  As a matter of fact, while we're looking at those crowd shots and how packed that place is, guys, see if you can pull up that report that we've got of Trump telling Democrats who are boycotting the inauguration, great, we really need the seats, so run that from Donald Trump as we look at this packed crowd at the inauguration.
[00:46:37.574 --> 00:46:41.756]  Congressman Lewis is saying he doesn't remember that he skipped that inauguration.
[00:46:41.796 --> 00:46:43.337]  He conveniently doesn't remember.
[00:46:43.397 --> 00:46:45.318]  How do you forget if you go to an inauguration?
[00:46:45.358 --> 00:46:47.378]  I can tell you what I was at the inauguration.
[00:46:48.399 --> 00:46:49.739]  You don't forget something like that.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.321]  So he got caught and it's pretty bad.
[00:46:54.341 --> 00:46:56.783]  And it's making him look bad, frankly.
[00:46:56.863 --> 00:46:57.783]  It's a very important time.
[00:46:58.163 --> 00:47:02.285]  This is a transition and a very important transition.
[00:47:02.985 --> 00:47:04.566]  And especially because things will be done
[00:47:05.379 --> 00:47:11.986]  Beautifully, but they'll be done differently than they have been over the past eight years And I can say over the past 16 years.
[00:47:12.066 --> 00:47:15.109]  I mean it'll be different and you know we have to have a smooth
[00:47:15.905 --> 00:47:16.486]  Transition.
[00:47:16.866 --> 00:47:20.669]  And President Obama understands that very well, and that's why he's been so gracious.
[00:47:20.769 --> 00:47:22.010]  But he understands that.
[00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:30.597]  And I think for him to have grandstanded, because I think he just grandstanded John Lewis, and then he got caught in a very bad lie.
[00:47:30.637 --> 00:47:31.858]  So, let's see what happens.
[00:47:31.938 --> 00:47:35.460]  As far as other people not going, that's okay, because we need seats so badly.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.742]  I hope they give me their tickets.
[00:47:37.802 --> 00:47:40.684]  Are they going to give us their tickets, or are they going to give them to other people?
[00:47:41.185 --> 00:47:42.426]  No, what happens to their tickets?
[00:47:42.446 --> 00:47:43.847]  I hope they're going to give us their tickets.
[00:47:44.844 --> 00:47:48.046]  And as you can see, they do need seats badly because it is packed.
[00:47:48.106 --> 00:47:50.708]  And it's just so amazing to see John Lewis.
[00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:58.554]  And it's a shame for him to drag his reputation through the mud, becoming a political hack, not just for the Democrats, but also for Hillary Clinton.
[00:47:58.574 --> 00:48:05.158]  Because remember, it was John Lewis who boycotted the previous inauguration.
[00:48:05.199 --> 00:48:07.260]  So while I don't really remember or not, you remember.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:07.640]  Yeah.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.483]  Joseph Farah, who was the editor of WND, had an article up.
[00:48:11.503 --> 00:48:12.464]  He says it's his first
[00:48:13.024 --> 00:48:13.264]  I think so.
[00:48:32.492 --> 00:48:38.678]  Lied about the fact that he couldn't remember whether he went to an inauguration or not and Trump called him on it and said, you'd remember if you went.
[00:48:38.718 --> 00:48:43.883]  But of course, he also called McCain and Palin racist like George Wallace.
[00:48:43.923 --> 00:48:46.746]  He called Romney and Ryan racist like George Wallace.
[00:48:47.126 --> 00:48:50.670]  But the worst thing, I think, and the most telling thing about John Lewis
[00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:56.692]  That's what he did during these primaries when he and the Democrat establishment, the DNC, hacked the election for Hillary.
[00:48:56.912 --> 00:49:03.694]  He was out there telling lies about Bernie Sanders, who was involved in the Civil Rights Movement, said, well, I never saw him, throwing him under the bus to do anything.
[00:49:03.734 --> 00:49:06.774]  This guy is such a political hack, even within his own party.
[00:49:07.215 --> 00:49:12.036]  It's just he's completely trashed his reputation for what he did in the Civil Rights Movement.
[00:49:12.056 --> 00:49:15.077]  He had a great reputation, but now he's been a political hack now for 30 years.
[00:49:15.717 --> 00:49:33.109]  Right, and I've kind of gotten some information from a lot of people on Twitter who are black conservatives, black libertarians, who are really fed up with the fact that white people can't even speak now and speak out against what, you know, John Lewis or anyone says because you're just immediately silenced.
[00:49:33.169 --> 00:49:33.729]  You're racist.
[00:49:33.749 --> 00:49:34.870]  Your opinion doesn't matter.
[00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:35.610]  It doesn't count.
[00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:41.194]  It's gotten to the point of ridiculousness to where John Lewis lashes out at Donald Trump.
[00:49:41.234 --> 00:49:42.295]  He's not even allowed to speak.
[00:49:42.615 --> 00:49:42.955]  You know what?
[00:49:43.155 --> 00:49:44.656]  We're coming up on Martin Luther King Jr.'
[00:49:44.596 --> 00:49:44.676]  's
[00:49:46.177 --> 00:49:49.360]  The holiday, so you're not allowed to speak to him in that way.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:56.806]  Even if it's facts, even if you're pointing out that he should be focusing on his district, just like with Maxine Waters, should be focusing on her district as well.
[00:49:57.706 --> 00:50:13.519]  Her constituents should be telling her to focus more on helping the community she's supposed to be representing, rather than getting out there and grandstanding and trying to say that Trump needs to be impeached for the rumor of Crooked Hillary, the rumor that she was unhealthy.
[00:50:14.229 --> 00:50:22.897]  Well, John Lewis would stand for some traditional liberal issues, but he would only stand for those issues when they were being attacked by Republicans.
[00:50:23.017 --> 00:50:27.241]  If they were being attacked by Barack Obama, he would take a powder and he wouldn't do anything about that.
[00:50:27.682 --> 00:50:35.309]  And as you're talking about the fact that they want to shut people down with screams of racism, screams of fascism, that's exactly what we saw.
[00:50:35.929 --> 00:50:42.735]  At the anti-abortion protests, where they wanted to shut people's speech down, people's signs down, by just putting up a black sign.
[00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:44.096]  I don't want to have a discussion.
[00:50:44.116 --> 00:50:46.658]  I just want to shut you up and shut you down.
[00:50:46.978 --> 00:50:47.819]  And that's what they do.
[00:50:47.859 --> 00:50:51.122]  That's what racism and fascism have become for them.
[00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:57.227]  They've become simply a black sign that they can put up over your speech.
[00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:58.968]  And that's the shame about it.
[00:50:59.188 --> 00:51:00.990]  That is that they're crying wolf.
[00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:07.295]  And when they use those terms that way, they're taking those terms off the table for people.
[00:51:07.355 --> 00:51:12.759]  So they're inoculating people against real racism, against real fascism, and that's the true danger.
[00:51:12.799 --> 00:51:19.345]  They've cried wolf about this so much that we need to have a discussion as to what real racism and fascism are because they've...
[00:51:19.485 --> 00:51:27.872]  They're obviously confused and the schooling that they're getting with all these social justice education that they're receiving is absolutely false and wrong.
[00:51:28.172 --> 00:51:36.859]  And when you look at these videos with these protesters who are like beating people with flagpoles and drawing blood and burning things down.
[00:51:36.879 --> 00:51:43.545]  There was a little kid who was so proud that he started a fire in the street because he said, you know, I just want to say I don't like this president.
[00:51:43.565 --> 00:51:45.486]  And you're like, where's your where's your parents?
[00:51:45.546 --> 00:51:46.087]  Where are your parents?
[00:51:46.587 --> 00:51:51.691]  But I don't want to live in an America where these people are in control of the country.
[00:51:51.911 --> 00:51:53.813]  Like, you look at them and you're like, go take a bath.
[00:51:53.933 --> 00:51:57.776]  I don't want you to be, you know, like, I don't, that's not the America I want to live in.
[00:51:57.796 --> 00:51:58.977]  It's just weird.
[00:51:59.257 --> 00:52:01.659]  It's petulant, it's immature, just like we see with that child.
[00:52:01.779 --> 00:52:04.521]  And I said before, they are the children of Obama.
[00:52:05.083 --> 00:52:24.929]  When Obama doesn't get his way in the democratic process, when he doesn't get his way, when our elected representatives say, no, we're not going to pass the law that you wanted, then he says, well, fine, then I'll just sign my executive order myself, and then I'll go to my safe place, and I'll use my phone and my pen, but he won't use his phone, he won't use his pen to try to keep jobs in America.
[00:52:25.209 --> 00:52:27.031]  To try to bring jobs to America.
[00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:39.224]  Donald Trump has already done more in the lead up to this election than Barack Obama did for the economy for the last eight years and he should listen to former Democrat advisor Carville who said it's the economy stupid.
[00:52:39.304 --> 00:52:41.826]  So let's go to the swearing-in process that's starting right now.
[00:52:41.846 --> 00:52:42.867]  Let's go to that live.
[00:52:43.148 --> 00:52:44.789]  They're swearing-in Vice President Pence.
[00:52:47.412 --> 00:52:50.914]  That I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:52:51.534 --> 00:52:54.836]  Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:52:55.276 --> 00:52:58.037]  Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:52:58.758 --> 00:53:02.040]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.281]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[00:53:05.741 --> 00:53:08.123]  That I take this obligation freely.
[00:53:08.865 --> 00:53:17.290]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge
[00:53:26.016 --> 00:53:26.637]  Congratulations.
[00:54:17.333 --> 00:54:22.354]  And of course you just heard Vice President Pence sworn in by Clarence Thomas.
[00:54:22.595 --> 00:54:26.316]  And they were about to have Donald Trump be sworn in by another Supreme Court Justice.
[00:54:29.716 --> 00:54:32.037]  Now there they are shaking hands with Barack Obama.
[00:54:33.458 --> 00:54:35.338]  This is the peaceful transition of power, folks.
[00:54:35.378 --> 00:54:37.319]  This is what the left does not want to see happen.
[00:54:40.539 --> 00:54:42.480]  The violent protesters who are protesting this.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.621]  Now we see Vice President Pence shaking hands with Donald Trump.
[00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:51.092]  Crowd cheers and Donald Trump is about to be sworn in.
[00:54:53.733 --> 00:54:59.415]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir accompanied by the President's own United States Marine Band.
[00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.430]  We're good.
[00:55:43.588 --> 00:55:52.417]  So I'm seeing on CNN about five minutes ago they announced the designated survivor is Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.
[00:55:52.437 --> 00:55:53.518]  Oh, that should make us feel better.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.461]  Let's hope nothing happens.
[00:55:57.501 --> 00:56:00.783]  That sounds like a setup for the deep state if there ever was one.
[00:56:01.443 --> 00:56:07.946]  What we're listening to right now is the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing America the Beautiful as a prelude to Donald Trump being sworn in.
[00:56:08.526 --> 00:56:14.009]  We've just had the swearing in of Vice President Pence by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
[00:56:19.605 --> 00:56:26.655]  You know, maybe I was just too young to remember, but I don't recall the whole designated survivor story being a big thing with Obama.
[00:56:27.535 --> 00:56:31.058]  Yeah, yeah, and I've never paid any attention to that.
[00:56:31.078 --> 00:56:37.703]  I mean, we have a whole chain of command that, you know, goes from President to Vice President to Speaker of the House and so forth and so on.
[00:56:38.384 --> 00:56:43.768]  And of course, there was a program with Kiefer Sutherland, designated survivor, that came out.
[00:56:43.808 --> 00:56:56.578]  Because it would take something where you had essentially most of the elected representatives wiped out in a single event, like a joint session of Congress or, you know, State of the Union where everybody gets together, Supreme Court and everything.
[00:56:57.822 --> 00:57:02.508]  To cut down everyone all at once for that to even come into play.
[00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:04.711]  But they go through these scenarios.
[00:57:04.751 --> 00:57:11.240]  I think the key thing about it is the fact that CNN have been pushing this narrative out there.
[00:57:11.541 --> 00:57:14.665]  They're the ones who are pushing that as a report.
[00:57:15.766 --> 00:57:17.588]  And then Jay Johnson, Homeland Security.
[00:57:17.628 --> 00:57:24.736]  Well, and the fact that the show Designated Survivor came out in 2016, it's like, hello, this is predictive programming.
[00:57:25.016 --> 00:57:26.378]  I mean, are you kidding?
[00:57:27.019 --> 00:57:32.805]  Well, and that's funny, we'll talk about this after, but the Directors Guild of America is saying someone's bullying and threatening them over Trump, so...
[00:57:33.846 --> 00:57:41.612]  Yeah, they mentioned that earlier, but yeah, in the sense that they don't even want any coverage of this, even though these guys are not supporters.
[00:57:41.632 --> 00:57:45.075]  But they do want to make shows about giving people ideas about, hey, you could take out the future president.
[00:57:46.036 --> 00:57:52.801]  And also you have the BBC putting out that documentary, The Kremlin Candidate, coming after Donald Trump.
[00:57:52.821 --> 00:57:55.703]  I mean, what a piece of trash that was from the BBC.
[00:57:55.743 --> 00:57:58.446]  And people should remember that the BBC gave
[00:58:00.587 --> 00:58:01.707]  Jimmy Saville, the pedophile.
[00:58:01.727 --> 00:58:03.328]  They gave him a pass throughout his life.
[00:58:04.368 --> 00:58:08.309]  Connected to the establishment in the UK, the royal family and so forth.
[00:58:08.449 --> 00:58:15.431]  And even shut down a documentary about Jimmy pedophile after he... Jimmy Saville, the pedophile.
[00:58:15.451 --> 00:58:20.052]  They even shut down the documentary about him that was done posthumously.
[00:58:20.112 --> 00:58:22.353]  So, you know, that's what we should call him.
[00:58:22.393 --> 00:58:23.373]  Jimmy pedophile.
[00:58:27.601 --> 00:58:29.142]  Oh, there's Hillary.
[00:58:29.202 --> 00:58:31.465]  Don't cry.
[00:58:31.505 --> 00:58:32.706]  Don't throw anything, Hillary.
[00:58:32.726 --> 00:58:34.147]  The Secret Service will take you down.
[00:58:34.167 --> 00:58:36.049]  Taking a big sigh there.
[00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:39.152]  There she throws her opera glasses at Donald Trump.
[00:58:39.232 --> 00:58:42.676]  It'll be a moment, won't it?
[00:58:42.696 --> 00:58:44.818]  Okay, this is the swearing in of Donald Trump.
[00:58:55.038 --> 00:58:57.080]  I don't have that protected glass up a little higher.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.001]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[00:58:59.021 --> 00:59:02.824]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[00:59:02.844 --> 00:59:06.667]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[00:59:07.047 --> 00:59:09.089]  That I will faithfully execute.
[00:59:09.749 --> 00:59:11.911]  That I will faithfully execute.
[00:59:12.151 --> 00:59:14.853]  The office of President of the United States.
[00:59:15.214 --> 00:59:18.136]  The office of President of the United States.
[00:59:18.556 --> 00:59:23.959]  And will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:59:23.979 --> 00:59:24.700]  So help me God.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.481]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[00:59:40.879 --> 00:59:43.460]  Okay, I'd welcome the radio audience.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.060]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.700]  I'm David Knight here with Leanne McAdoo.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:50.681]  You're joining our live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration.
[00:59:50.821 --> 00:59:55.082]  And as you just heard, he has just been sworn in as President of the United States.
[00:59:55.122 --> 00:59:56.402]  And there he is with his family.
[00:59:56.722 --> 01:00:03.543]  The oath of office was given to Vice President Pence a little bit earlier by Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court Justice.
[01:00:03.583 --> 01:00:06.564]  That was Justice Roberts, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
[01:00:07.544 --> 01:00:10.106]  Swearing in Donald Trump as president.
[01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:12.508]  It is now an accomplished fact.
[01:00:13.328 --> 01:00:15.870]  Barack Obama is no longer president.
[01:00:18.391 --> 01:00:23.395]  You mean the resist movement, the never Trump, and the disrupt J20 weren't able to stop this?
[01:00:23.815 --> 01:00:24.936]  That's right.
[01:00:24.976 --> 01:00:28.218]  Do you think they're gonna get a little dose of reality now and accept this?
[01:00:31.485 --> 01:00:31.985]  Really happened.
[01:00:32.306 --> 01:00:36.849]  Joy and Schadenfreude at the same time.
[01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:43.114]  And there is a 21-gun salute that is going off of some cannons after the swearing-in ceremony.
[01:00:43.134 --> 01:00:46.576]  And we should be having Donald Trump's speech.
[01:00:46.596 --> 01:00:50.359]  We're going to carry that live for those of you who are radio affiliates.
[01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:52.701]  We'll be carrying Donald Trump's speech live.
[01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:53.121]  Donald J. Trump.
[01:01:02.529 --> 01:01:06.232]  Donald Trump has been sworn in and now this is his speech.
[01:01:08.934 --> 01:01:10.655]  First speech as President of the United States.
[01:01:21.363 --> 01:01:30.370]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama,
[01:01:31.158 --> 01:01:36.059]  Fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you.
[01:01:41.741 --> 01:01:55.385]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[01:01:57.554 --> 01:02:05.416]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:08.557]  We will face challenges.
[01:02:09.177 --> 01:02:10.838]  We will confront hardships.
[01:02:11.458 --> 01:02:13.519]  But we will get the job done.
[01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:21.141]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[01:02:22.287 --> 01:02:33.013]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[01:02:33.693 --> 01:02:35.994]  They have been magnificent.
[01:02:36.314 --> 01:02:36.755]  Thank you.
[01:02:39.996 --> 01:02:41.877]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[01:02:49.451 --> 01:03:02.615]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[01:03:03.175 --> 01:03:06.336]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[01:03:10.897 --> 01:03:11.697]  That's a great line.
[01:03:12.618 --> 01:03:13.978]  Transferring power back to the people.
[01:03:14.997 --> 01:03:25.123]  For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost.
[01:03:27.445 --> 01:03:33.149]  Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.
[01:03:34.149 --> 01:03:40.293]  Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
[01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:47.865]  The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
[01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:52.168]  Their victories have not been your victories.
[01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:55.730]  Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[01:03:56.270 --> 01:04:07.318]  And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
[01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:18.549]  That all changes starting right here and right now.
[01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:21.732]  Because this moment is your moment.
[01:04:21.853 --> 01:04:23.574]  It belongs to you.
[01:04:31.036 --> 01:04:37.164]  It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
[01:04:37.785 --> 01:04:38.886]  This is your day.
[01:04:39.647 --> 01:04:41.089]  This is your celebration.
[01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:46.315]  And this, the United States of America, is your country.
[01:04:54.426 --> 01:05:03.234]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[01:05:07.739 --> 01:05:18.769]  January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
[01:05:24.391 --> 01:05:30.333]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
[01:05:35.094 --> 01:05:36.774]  Everyone is listening to you now.
[01:05:37.454 --> 01:05:47.637]  You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.
[01:05:52.518 --> 01:06:01.542]  At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[01:06:02.363 --> 01:06:10.647]  Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
[01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:22.011]  These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.
[01:06:22.892 --> 01:06:26.655]  But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.
[01:06:27.595 --> 01:06:31.418]  Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities.
[01:06:32.278 --> 01:06:37.002]  Rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape.
[01:06:37.822 --> 01:06:38.482]  of our nation.
[01:06:39.342 --> 01:06:48.885]  An education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
[01:06:50.565 --> 01:07:01.668]  And the crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
[01:07:02.879 --> 01:07:10.117]  This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
[01:07:19.318 --> 01:07:23.161]  We are one nation, and their pain is our pain.
[01:07:23.822 --> 01:07:29.647]  Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.
[01:07:30.668 --> 01:07:36.773]  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
[01:07:38.395 --> 01:07:44.020]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[01:07:50.011 --> 01:08:04.586]  For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
[01:08:05.767 --> 01:08:11.213]  We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
[01:08:14.301 --> 01:08:15.442]  Welcome to our radio audience.
[01:08:15.562 --> 01:08:17.103]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:08:17.123 --> 01:08:19.604]  This is live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration.
[01:08:19.624 --> 01:08:20.204]  He's already been sworn in.
[01:08:20.224 --> 01:08:28.609]  Trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
[01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:41.116]  We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
[01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:55.915]  One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.
[01:08:57.256 --> 01:09:06.838]  The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
[01:09:08.629 --> 01:09:09.949]  But that is the past.
[01:09:10.989 --> 01:09:15.030]  And now we are looking only to the future.
[01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:23.952]  It's really great how this speech is not being made about Donald Trump.
[01:09:24.712 --> 01:09:35.134]  We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.
[01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:41.776]  From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
[01:09:42.377 --> 01:09:49.302]  From this day forward, it's going to be only America first!
[01:09:50.043 --> 01:09:51.784]  America first!
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:58.762]  That's right, he's been elected President of America, not the leader of the global cartel.
[01:09:58.802 --> 01:10:10.068]  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
[01:10:10.728 --> 01:10:21.394]  We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.
[01:10:23.643 --> 01:10:28.766]  That's right, in eight weeks he did more than Barack Obama did in eight years to bring jobs to America.
[01:10:28.786 --> 01:10:32.169]  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
[01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:41.635]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never, ever let you down.
[01:10:47.379 --> 01:10:49.440]  America will start winning again.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.242]  Winning like never before.
[01:10:53.399 --> 01:10:56.560]  We're not going to get tired of it.
[01:10:56.601 --> 01:10:58.441]  We will bring back our jobs.
[01:10:59.382 --> 01:11:01.443]  We will bring back our borders.
[01:11:02.263 --> 01:11:04.244]  We will bring back our wealth.
[01:11:04.964 --> 01:11:08.066]  And we will bring back our dreams.
[01:11:14.682 --> 01:11:25.005]  We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.
[01:11:26.645 --> 01:11:36.388]  We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
[01:11:36.948 --> 01:11:37.868]  And all the Democrats.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.648]  We will follow two simple rules.
[01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:47.621]  Buy American and hire American.
[01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:50.711]  Paul Ryan doesn't like that.
[01:11:50.731 --> 01:11:51.171]  No, no.
[01:11:51.191 --> 01:11:52.092]  He already took that out last night.
[01:11:52.132 --> 01:12:04.700]  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
[01:12:05.981 --> 01:12:13.566]  We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example.
[01:12:13.786 --> 01:12:17.729]  We will shine for everyone to follow.
[01:12:20.978 --> 01:12:21.939]  I'm gonna force your policies.
[01:12:22.099 --> 01:12:35.765]  We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.
[01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:48.146]  At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America.
[01:12:48.706 --> 01:12:55.750]  And through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
[01:12:57.271 --> 01:13:03.354]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[01:13:07.668 --> 01:13:12.712]  It's right to see people as other human beings, as other Americans, rather than a demographic group.
[01:13:12.732 --> 01:13:19.617]  The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[01:13:20.578 --> 01:13:28.964]  We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
[01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:35.829]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[01:13:39.031 --> 01:13:43.033]  Again, we're covering live the speech of Donald Trump after his inauguration.
[01:13:43.053 --> 01:13:44.233]  There should be no fear.
[01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:45.514]  We are protected.
[01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.335]  And we will always be protected.
[01:13:48.915 --> 01:13:54.358]  We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement.
[01:13:55.258 --> 01:14:02.061]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:05.743]  Good.
[01:14:06.763 --> 01:14:07.123]  It's God.
[01:14:09.423 --> 01:14:13.744]  Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
[01:14:14.544 --> 01:14:21.366]  In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
[01:14:22.526 --> 01:14:31.828]  We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.
[01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.508]  The time for empty talk is over.
[01:14:44.289 --> 01:14:47.431]  Now arrives the hour of action.
[01:14:47.451 --> 01:14:51.375]  He's already been pretty active.
[01:14:51.435 --> 01:14:53.056]  He wants to get right to work.
[01:14:53.076 --> 01:14:57.900]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:03.584]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[01:15:04.145 --> 01:15:05.406]  We will not fail.
[01:15:06.126 --> 01:15:08.969]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[01:15:11.053 --> 01:15:27.403]  We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.
[01:15:28.243 --> 01:15:35.088]  A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
[01:15:35.888 --> 01:15:40.530]  It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget.
[01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:50.274]  That whether we are black, or brown, or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[01:15:56.817 --> 01:16:04.700]  We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.
[01:16:10.049 --> 01:16:30.533]  And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.
[01:16:37.361 --> 01:16:47.475]  So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words.
[01:16:48.076 --> 01:16:51.240]  You will never be ignored again.
[01:16:56.590 --> 01:17:04.056]  Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny.
[01:17:04.937 --> 01:17:09.861]  And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
[01:17:11.138 --> 01:17:14.921]  Together, we will make America strong again.
[01:17:15.621 --> 01:17:18.343]  We will make America wealthy again.
[01:17:18.783 --> 01:17:21.505]  We will make America proud again.
[01:17:21.965 --> 01:17:24.567]  We will make America safe again.
[01:17:25.027 --> 01:17:30.671]  And yes, together, we will make America great again.
[01:17:31.212 --> 01:17:35.134]  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
[01:17:37.276 --> 01:17:37.756]  Thank you.
[01:17:39.437 --> 01:17:40.278]  God bless America.
[01:17:42.668 --> 01:17:46.569]  Alright, you've been listening to the first speech of President Trump.
[01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:51.431]  He's now been sworn in at the inaugural, and that was his first speech.
[01:17:51.471 --> 01:17:56.472]  And of course, Leanne, as he was talking about that, he focused not on himself, but he focused on the people.
[01:17:56.492 --> 01:18:03.734]  He said, not from one person to another, not from one party to another, but power has been transferred back to the people.
[01:18:03.814 --> 01:18:08.696]  It's not which party controls government, but if government is controlled by the people.
[01:18:09.716 --> 01:18:13.058]  I can only imagine if Hillary Clinton would have been giving that speech.
[01:18:13.098 --> 01:18:16.039]  It would have been all about social policy.
[01:18:16.439 --> 01:18:17.519]  I am the first woman.
[01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:18.600]  You notice I'm a woman?
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.741]  I am the first woman here to be Prime President.
[01:18:20.881 --> 01:18:22.861]  I've broken through the glass ceiling.
[01:18:23.102 --> 01:18:26.243]  Oh, we would have heard glass ceiling, glass ceiling, glass ceiling.
[01:18:26.263 --> 01:18:27.343]  It would have been all about her.
[01:18:27.523 --> 01:18:28.884]  And that was very refreshing.
[01:18:29.284 --> 01:18:31.925]  It'll be interesting to see how people try to tear that speech apart.
[01:18:32.025 --> 01:18:37.108]  So he made this not about himself, as Hillary Clinton would have made it about her and about her being a woman.
[01:18:37.168 --> 01:18:41.951]  He made it about the people, said you are the people who are, the people are supposed to control the government.
[01:18:41.991 --> 01:18:43.052]  That's what we're going to have happen.
[01:18:43.072 --> 01:18:43.472]  Right.
[01:18:43.773 --> 01:18:51.237]  And of course he also made a comment that is absolutely going to set the mainstream media ablaze.
[01:18:51.298 --> 01:18:56.361]  They are going to be absolutely incensed about the fact that he said we will eradicate
[01:18:57.685 --> 01:19:00.068]  Radical Islam from the face of the earth.
[01:19:00.468 --> 01:19:08.958]  That's a phrase that Obama and the left and the mainstream media could barely bring themselves to say in the face of a terrorist shooting.
[01:19:08.998 --> 01:19:10.500]  They couldn't talk about radical Islam.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.905]  And he called it out and said we will eradicate radical Islam from the face of the earth.
[01:19:15.711 --> 01:19:28.900]  They only uttered those words, finally, Hillary Clinton, when she was campaigning this last year and she was forced to have to do it because she could see that that was what was helping Donald Trump really connect with the worries that the American people were having.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.462]  She finally uttered those words, but...
[01:19:32.122 --> 01:19:32.802]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:19:50.693 --> 01:19:52.534]  And I'll have to go back and get my source.
[01:19:52.574 --> 01:19:56.154]  It was 3,400 regulations in 2015 alone.
[01:19:56.214 --> 01:20:05.977]  So maybe this is a little over 3,000 regulations in 2016 alone, because they're talking about 97,000 pages in 2016 alone, an all-time record.
[01:20:06.397 --> 01:20:08.957]  I think that there may be some confusion on that.
[01:20:09.277 --> 01:20:13.098]  As I reported earlier, they have accelerated the number of regulations.
[01:20:13.198 --> 01:20:15.339]  And if you talk about midnight regulations, that's
[01:20:15.959 --> 01:20:22.463]  That's what they call the lame duck regulations from the election onto the swearing in of the next president.
[01:20:22.503 --> 01:20:26.505]  But of course, we really truly did have midnight regulations brought in last night.
[01:20:26.545 --> 01:20:37.731]  We had a massive, I think it was something like 1,500 pages of regulations, I read that article earlier today, just last night from the chain, the people who are forging our chains there in the bureaucracy.
[01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:40.873]  This is what Obama has used his pen and his phone for.
[01:20:40.953 --> 01:20:42.094]  Not to save jobs.
[01:20:42.814 --> 01:20:58.418]  Not to keep companies from moving jobs to other countries, not to entice them to bring jobs here, not to say to people, look, you've got these jobs, these factories in other countries, understand that it'll be to your economic interest to move that production to the United States, which is what other countries have done.
[01:20:58.478 --> 01:20:59.579]  It's what China has done.
[01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:04.040]  China has unabashedly protected its own markets.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.281]  They've made it very difficult for other people to do business there, and they have done everything to incentivize it.
[01:21:09.321 --> 01:21:11.162]  We see this all the time in terms of the
[01:21:11.682 --> 01:21:20.708]  Massive ships that are coming from China, going to Walmart, coming here heavily laden, record-sized ships, and yet they return completely empty.
[01:21:21.348 --> 01:21:25.330]  And so this is something that Donald Trump has done, even though he wasn't president.
[01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:31.154]  He did more as president-elect to save jobs than we saw President Obama do.
[01:21:31.214 --> 01:21:33.215]  President Obama has been costing us jobs.
[01:21:33.235 --> 01:21:36.957]  When you go into debt, when you create this kind of regulation, and you don't do any...
[01:21:38.078 --> 01:21:38.379]  No, absolutely.
[01:21:52.079 --> 01:21:53.340]  Yeah, I think there needs to be some clarification.
[01:22:09.014 --> 01:22:17.421]  But yeah, President Obama kept breaking the record for the amount of regulations that were, even though he only signed like 1,300 bills into law.
[01:22:17.501 --> 01:22:29.490]  So for those 1,300 bills into law, there were thousands and thousands of regulations, which of course is only going to stymie businesses, and small businesses are going to be the most affected by those regulations.
[01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:33.933]  That's right, and that's been a problem with both the Republican and Democrat-controlled Congresses.
[01:22:34.273 --> 01:22:37.596]  It's not just Obama and his executive orders, but they do not want
[01:22:38.956 --> 01:22:49.520]  They want to pass that power on to the bureaucracy and both people like Paul Ryan and John Boehner as well as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid, they're all happy to do that.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.561]  Hopefully that is something that is going to change under President Trump.
[01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:55.702]  We have a story that is breaking at InfoWars.com.
[01:22:55.742 --> 01:23:03.145]  Police allow Black Lives Matter to attack women at a Trump inauguration and I think we've got a video for this guys?
[01:23:03.165 --> 01:23:06.066]  Do we have a video that we can show here or is that just a report?
[01:23:07.827 --> 01:23:09.308]  I think we have some video.
[01:23:09.328 --> 01:23:11.269]  The article is up on Infowars.com.
[01:23:11.289 --> 01:23:17.213]  And of course, that's what Alex Jones and the rest of the crew who are now live on the streets of Washington, D.C.
[01:23:17.253 --> 01:23:18.053]  have been talking about.
[01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:25.398]  The fact that the police have been pretty passive in the face of violent protesters, not only
[01:23:26.198 --> 01:23:42.386]  Blocking people's access to the inauguration, getting at the entrance there before they go through the security services, keeping people from getting into the inauguration itself, but also attacking people, attacking women, hitting people with sucker punches, and there you can see Alex Jones.
[01:23:42.406 --> 01:23:45.428]  That's a Facebook mention there, I think, that we have going on there.
[01:23:45.448 --> 01:23:46.328]  You can see that live stream.
[01:23:46.508 --> 01:23:53.312]  And I tweeted out a video a little earlier this morning of the crowd there, the barricade of bodies.
[01:23:54.492 --> 01:24:02.316]  They were not allowing one of these Trump supporters to get into the inauguration and they actually separated him from his wife.
[01:24:02.696 --> 01:24:05.618]  So here he is on the other side of the barricade of people.
[01:24:06.178 --> 01:24:19.205]  And they're not allowing his wife to come through and she's freaking out and he's freaking out, like, you know, I mean, now you're, now you're messing with people's primal urges to want to bludgeon you over the head, but of course he can't, you know, fight back against that.
[01:24:19.225 --> 01:24:22.886]  I mean, how, how would you have reacted if they separated you from Karen, you know?
[01:24:22.906 --> 01:24:24.447]  That is not speech, okay?
[01:24:24.487 --> 01:24:29.870]  We have to understand, when the left goes out here, they've said things like, well, you know what, we need to have a government subsidy.
[01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:36.252]  For us to create quote-unquote art that has a container of urine with a crucifix in it.
[01:24:36.472 --> 01:24:40.853]  And so that's our free speech and you need to subsidize that to make it free for us, okay?
[01:24:41.093 --> 01:24:42.574]  That's not what free speech is, folks.
[01:24:43.114 --> 01:24:47.055]  Free speech is political speech and that's precisely what they do not want to have.
[01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.216]  They don't want to have any political speech.
[01:24:49.256 --> 01:25:00.039]  They don't want to back and forth and they want to shut you down and they won't even, when you give them the microphone to talk to the audience, they won't even use that to talk to people to tell them what they think.
[01:25:00.219 --> 01:25:17.125]  Well just like the free speech that we had at the inauguration when the crowd went wild booing and chanting lock her up when they announced Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton walking down so the entire crowd chanting lock her up and you know of course we gotta be gracious but maybe that's why she was uh
[01:25:18.168 --> 01:25:20.049]  Looked a little upset there.
[01:25:20.489 --> 01:25:27.373]  Again, we're going to run through, for those of you that are listening on the internet, we're going to run through live with our coverage of the inauguration.
[01:25:27.393 --> 01:25:28.913]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:25:28.933 --> 01:25:34.977]  We also have our crew in Washington, D.C., and we hear the singing that's going on there.
[01:25:34.997 --> 01:25:45.502]  Also, I want to remind you that to help support that InfoWars ground crew and our efforts to bring that information to you live, as we see the protesters there, we give you the side of it that the mainstream media is not going to give you.

[01:26:40.799 --> 01:26:46.947]  And those are sales that will be ending soon, tied to the inauguration to the beginning of the new year.
[01:26:48.151 --> 01:27:03.985]  Well, I've just been handed some news that despite multiple polls from the fake news outlets that are out there trying to tell people that Donald Trump is just public enemy number one, the majority of Americans view Trump favorably, according to the latest polls.
[01:27:05.206 --> 01:27:08.189]  This was about 52% now.
[01:27:08.489 --> 01:27:10.371]  So they keep trying to say it's hovering around 40%.
[01:27:12.653 --> 01:27:13.854]  It's not rocket science.
[01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:15.654]  He just won the election, folks.
[01:27:17.235 --> 01:27:19.155]  And here's another metric for you.
[01:27:19.696 --> 01:27:33.280]  If you're confused about these competing polls, just take a look at how the NFL, that has been taking the position of Kaepernick and others, look at how they have plummeted in popularity.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.721]  And I think it is tied to that.
[01:27:34.901 --> 01:27:37.402]  I don't think it is anything other than that.
[01:27:37.942 --> 01:27:39.903]  And they continue to come out with that.
[01:27:39.943 --> 01:27:42.604]  They're going to be using the Super Bowl probably.
[01:27:42.664 --> 01:27:50.388]  The entertainers that will be there will be given an opportunity platform to criticize Donald Trump and I'm sure that's what they'll do.
[01:27:50.468 --> 01:27:52.629]  And there you can see Donald Trump waving goodbye to the crowd.
[01:27:53.349 --> 01:27:54.369]  He has been sworn in.
[01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:59.972]  He's given his speech and his speech focused on a transfer of power, not to him.
[01:28:00.812 --> 01:28:02.633]  Not to a party, but to the people.
[01:28:02.693 --> 01:28:05.794]  He said, this is not a transfer from one person to the other.
[01:28:05.874 --> 01:28:08.415]  Exactly the opposite of what we would have heard from Hillary Clinton.
[01:28:08.915 --> 01:28:13.496]  She would have been basking in the glory of her identity politics if she had won.
[01:28:13.536 --> 01:28:15.517]  But he was talking about how this is a movement.
[01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:16.877]  We're going to take back power.
[01:28:17.537 --> 01:28:18.378]  Give it to the people.
[01:28:18.438 --> 01:28:20.678]  The people are going to now be controlling the government.
[01:28:21.399 --> 01:28:25.480]  And a very, very different type of speech than we would have heard from Hillary Clinton.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.521]  Right, as it should be.
[01:28:27.161 --> 01:28:31.585]  And I gotta say, I was even moved a little bit watching Melania, you know, come down.
[01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:39.150]  I mean, they are just American, just American people who ended up becoming very successful, you know, just Americans.
[01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:39.811]  And now here they are.
[01:28:39.851 --> 01:28:43.934]  They weren't politically active their entire life like the Clintons, so.
[01:28:44.434 --> 01:28:48.898]  Yeah, alright, so we're gonna go to break and we're gonna be right back.
[01:28:49.438 --> 01:28:52.781]  Stay with us, we'll be returning with our live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration.
[01:29:02.344 --> 01:29:05.347]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:06.268 --> 01:29:08.952]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:13.516 --> 01:29:21.445]  Well the man that was arrested for threatening to kill Donald Trump online, get this folks, he was in fact a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[01:29:21.625 --> 01:29:24.428]  Now this was reported by the Daily Mail and it's up on our website.
[01:29:24.588 --> 01:29:27.912]  This man once gave 20 grand to the DNC, not surprising.
[01:29:28.092 --> 01:29:33.859]  He was arrested by the Miami Beach Police on Tuesday of this week for threatening President-elect Trump online.
[01:29:34.099 --> 01:29:39.022]  Turns out he's a member of a prominent Northeast family that's close to the Clintons, giving that whopping money.
[01:29:39.082 --> 01:29:42.144]  And his name, Dominic Papoulo Jr., he's 51 years old.
[01:29:42.244 --> 01:29:49.870]  He sat near Hillary Clinton when she delivered the eulogy at the funeral of his mother, who died on one of the jets that flew into the World Trade Center on 9-11.
[01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:52.491]  Now, during the eulogy on October 6, 2001, in Boston,
[01:29:53.632 --> 01:29:57.095]  Hillary Clinton actually referred to him as a computer wizard.
[01:29:57.255 --> 01:30:02.819]  He's now being held, of course, in the Miami-Dade County Jail after using Twitter to threaten the life of Donald Trump.
[01:30:02.859 --> 01:30:06.142]  Now, Trump is scheduled to be sworn in this week in Washington, D.C.
[01:30:06.162 --> 01:30:10.145]  He remains incarcerated on the charge of threatening to harm a public servant.
[01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:12.706]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:13.607 --> 01:30:20.711]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:30:21.092 --> 01:30:34.300]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:30:47.135 --> 01:30:53.102]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[01:31:13.916 --> 01:31:20.080]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:22.042]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[01:31:22.932 --> 01:31:24.834]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[01:31:25.414 --> 01:31:30.999]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[01:31:31.579 --> 01:31:39.565]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[01:31:39.586 --> 01:31:42.047]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[01:31:42.328 --> 01:31:43.529]  This is the best system out there.
[01:31:43.789 --> 01:31:46.551]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[01:31:46.811 --> 01:31:47.552]  This is how it works.
[01:31:47.852 --> 01:31:48.373]  You order.
[01:31:48.493 --> 01:31:49.293]  Customized or

[01:32:00.042 --> 01:32:00.822]  You cannot lose.
[01:32:00.862 --> 01:32:01.943]  You're funding the Infowar.

[01:32:09.329 --> 01:32:13.292]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[01:32:23.576 --> 01:32:28.368]  Live from the InfoWorks.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.521]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:36.943]  I'm David Knight here in Austin with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:32:37.003 --> 01:32:39.844]  Our crew is live in Washington D.C.
[01:32:40.485 --> 01:32:43.347]  Alex Jones was in the crowd at the inauguration.
[01:32:43.367 --> 01:32:46.829]  He'll be heading to our remote studio there in Washington D.C.
[01:32:47.329 --> 01:32:51.812]  and coming on the show live we're going to have this going well into tonight, our live coverage.
[01:32:52.313 --> 01:32:54.034]  And of course we have other crew that are there.
[01:32:54.654 --> 01:32:56.975]  Looking to see what is happening on the streets.
[01:32:57.075 --> 01:33:06.278]  And as reports that we've gotten back, we see that the police, and this is a report from Infowars.com, police allowed Black Lives Matter to attack women at a Trump inauguration.
[01:33:06.298 --> 01:33:08.919]  We have a street fight that has broken out near the inauguration.
[01:33:09.259 --> 01:33:13.741]  We have anti-Trump protesters smashing windows, vandalizing cars on the streets of Washington.
[01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:22.744]  They were keeping people from getting into the inauguration, getting at the security entrance there to try to prevent people from being able to attend this.
[01:33:23.684 --> 01:33:32.068]  And all of this is on their side while we see this, we see Maureen Dowd claiming that the country is divided like the Civil War.
[01:33:32.088 --> 01:33:35.709]  And I have to say, let's understand who is initiating this.
[01:33:35.929 --> 01:33:38.971]  Let's understand that it is California that wants to secede.
[01:33:39.491 --> 01:33:42.812]  And I would like to help them in any way that I possibly can.
[01:33:42.832 --> 01:33:45.874]  I understand that some of you... You should donate money to your cause.
[01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:55.964]  I understand that some of you in California are conservative and you don't like what's happening there, but we would offer you the ability to stay in the union.
[01:33:56.004 --> 01:34:01.130]  You could call it America California, or New California, whatever you want to call it.
[01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:03.092]  You could call it Free California maybe.
[01:34:03.132 --> 01:34:05.174]  That'd be a good thing instead of like they did with...
[01:34:06.155 --> 01:34:09.596]  Instead of, you know, when they had the first Civil War, you had Virginia.
[01:34:09.636 --> 01:34:12.457]  When they left, Western Virginia decided they wanted to stay.
[01:34:12.917 --> 01:34:15.457]  So you wound up with West Virginia and Virginia.
[01:34:15.497 --> 01:34:20.839]  So we could have a California, which is its own nation or joins Mexico or something.
[01:34:21.319 --> 01:34:25.020]  And the rest of you could be free California and you could stay with us.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.020]  Let's let them go.
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.601]  Yeah, okay, now I see what you're saying.
[01:34:27.641 --> 01:34:34.323]  Yes, the free, because I was going to say California is one of the most heavily regulated states in the country, but maybe it has to be New York.
[01:34:34.343 --> 01:34:38.665]  The rest of them could just be regular California, with all the regulations, with all the taxes.
[01:34:38.685 --> 01:34:51.710]  Be free again, like the people who headed out West originally intended to be the free, wild West, and now it's just been reclaimed by these fascist liberals out there who want to regulate everything.
[01:34:52.170 --> 01:34:58.513]  Well, we carried the Trump swearing-in and we'll have clips of that, highlights of that, that we'll be playing.
[01:34:58.553 --> 01:35:02.514]  But I think, Leanne, the highlights for me, and I thought it was a very good speech.
[01:35:02.855 --> 01:35:05.916]  It did not go on forever, like Barack Obama's speech.
[01:35:05.936 --> 01:35:07.577]  I printed his farewell speech.
[01:35:07.677 --> 01:35:10.778]  And his 92, I, I, I, me, me, me, I.
[01:35:11.118 --> 01:35:12.799]  Yeah, he just could not get off the stage.
[01:35:12.839 --> 01:35:19.721]  But Donald Trump's speech was very concise, what was put together, but it focused on the fact that it was not about him.
[01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:29.884]  That power was not transferred from one individual to another, from one party to another, but he was there to preside over a transfer of power to the people.
[01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:35.546]  And that the government should be controlled by the people and not the other way around.
[01:35:35.586 --> 01:35:39.147]  It was a great speech, and I think one of the things that's going to come out of this
[01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:56.483]  The left and we're waiting for all of the mainstream media to get to their typewriters and start furiously typing away about the fact that he said we will eradicate radical Islam from the face of the earth, a phrase that they loathe, that they will not use, even in the wake of a terrorist event.
[01:35:57.003 --> 01:36:01.204]  That the radical Muslims take credit for as being part of their jihad.
[01:36:01.244 --> 01:36:03.404]  They will not use the phrase radical Islam.
[01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:05.625]  He couldn't even get Barack Obama to say that phrase.
[01:36:05.925 --> 01:36:12.706]  He said not only the phrase but he said we will eradicate radical Islam from the face of the earth and we're going to stop the crime.
[01:36:12.726 --> 01:36:16.967]  We're going to stop the loss of jobs that's going to end right here and now.
[01:36:17.047 --> 01:36:22.208]  So we're going to have those excerpts for you from President Trump and there you see President Trump with
[01:36:22.808 --> 01:36:25.229]  Former President Obama.
[01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:26.970]  Oh, I just have a problem.
[01:36:27.010 --> 01:36:27.530]  Sorry, folks.
[01:36:28.171 --> 01:36:28.671]  I'm coming.
[01:36:28.691 --> 01:36:31.873]  I do have a bias, and I am not ashamed of it.
[01:36:31.973 --> 01:36:38.456]  I do have a problem calling Obama President because I don't ever think that he was qualified to take the office.
[01:36:38.496 --> 01:36:43.758]  I don't believe, even if you took him at his word with his falsified birth certificate, that he was a natural-born citizen.
[01:36:43.819 --> 01:36:46.700]  So, there he is, the usurper-in-chief.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:56.210]  To see how, like you said, waiting for the media minions to get back to their typewriters and figure out what they're going to be able to pull from this speech that Donald Trump gave.
[01:36:56.851 --> 01:37:06.982]  But also these protesters out there, are they going to be able to finally break out of the cult that they're in and wrap their minds around this very inclusive message?
[01:37:07.422 --> 01:37:08.744]  They're out there in the streets.
[01:37:09.164 --> 01:37:10.784]  Saying, power to the people!
[01:37:10.904 --> 01:37:11.484]  Whose streets?
[01:37:11.584 --> 01:37:12.044]  Our streets!
[01:37:12.525 --> 01:37:19.386]  And this is exactly what President Trump is saying that he is about and what he wants to usher in to make America great again.
[01:37:19.406 --> 01:37:20.766]  It was an inclusive thing.
[01:37:21.326 --> 01:37:27.207]  All Americans, regardless of your race, class, creed, we're all Americans and there's no room for prejudice here.
[01:37:27.227 --> 01:37:34.928]  And I just wonder if they could even open their minds enough to allow that message to come in or do they truly just believe?
[01:37:35.248 --> 01:37:38.229]  You know, the big meme going around social media this morning was,
[01:37:38.789 --> 01:37:41.130]  Don't forget to set your clock back 300 years.
[01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:45.293]  Like, no civil rights issues are even on the table here.
[01:37:46.714 --> 01:37:47.174]  That's funny.
[01:37:48.355 --> 01:37:58.121]  But, you know, let's set the clocks back to 40 years ago when we had the radical left that were saying let's stop the Vietnam War.
[01:37:58.201 --> 01:37:58.901]  I agreed with them.
[01:37:59.061 --> 01:38:00.382]  I want to stop the Vietnam War.
[01:38:00.422 --> 01:38:01.243]  It was very clear.
[01:38:01.883 --> 01:38:03.083]  That we were being played.
[01:38:04.844 --> 01:38:07.045]  You know, fairly early on we were being played.
[01:38:07.065 --> 01:38:09.026]  It was a false flag attack that began that war.
[01:38:09.306 --> 01:38:12.947]  It was clear that the American government had no intention of trying to even win that war.
[01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:18.289]  They would go in and take over an area and a great loss of American life and then just walk away and leave it open.
[01:38:18.329 --> 01:38:19.610]  So it's like, let's stop this.
[01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:20.910]  Why are we doing this?
[01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:23.851]  And of course it's being run by people like Robert McNamara.
[01:38:24.352 --> 01:38:25.212]  He admitted
[01:38:25.792 --> 01:38:31.054]  In a documentary, The Fog of War, he admitted that it was a false flag that began the whole thing, the Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:38:31.094 --> 01:38:33.114]  So, yeah, we should have stopped that war.
[01:38:33.154 --> 01:38:34.815]  We had no business being in that war.
[01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:38.496]  And we have no business being in the seven wars that we're in now, quite frankly.
[01:38:38.516 --> 01:38:40.837]  The ones that Obama opened up.
[01:38:40.857 --> 01:38:42.317]  Every year of his presidency.
[01:38:42.537 --> 01:38:42.998]  Absolutely.
[01:38:44.238 --> 01:38:51.522]  Can't we go back to the time when we played a little bit of a clip there with John Lennon and those who were anti-war protesters saying, let's give peace a chance.
[01:38:51.943 --> 01:38:54.044]  Why don't you guys give peace a chance?
[01:38:54.084 --> 01:38:56.465]  Why don't you stop trying to push for war with Russia?
[01:38:56.865 --> 01:38:58.687]  Why don't you give Donald Trump a chance?
[01:38:58.927 --> 01:39:00.127]  See what he's going to do.
[01:39:00.348 --> 01:39:09.273]  Maybe, just maybe, you're wrong about all this racism, fascism, xenophobia, anti-woman rhetoric that you've been fed.
[01:39:09.433 --> 01:39:10.333]  Maybe you're wrong about that.
[01:39:10.373 --> 01:39:11.214]  Just give it a chance.
[01:39:11.394 --> 01:39:35.541]  Right, well and of course we see, they don't want to give it a chance and we're seeing how people who are in control of the media, Hollywood, those establishments, they were in collusion with President Obama's America and his government so now they are giving these, according to members of the Directors Guild of America, they're working on TV coverage of the inauguration and all the related events.
[01:39:36.241 --> 01:39:36.541]  I don't
[01:39:51.688 --> 01:39:54.050]  Calling Trump the monster we all fear.
[01:39:54.551 --> 01:39:59.415]  It is not an overstatement that he is about to destroy this country if we don't do something about it.
[01:39:59.876 --> 01:40:07.242]  There is no need of naming names when the inaugural credits will tell us enough about the people who truly care about this country and those who don't share the same ideals.
[01:40:07.282 --> 01:40:12.647]  So basically threatening the Director's Guild of America, don't you dare shine any positive light on this inauguration.
[01:40:12.667 --> 01:40:16.791]  It's in stark contrast to what we saw in 2009 with the network
[01:40:18.312 --> 01:40:22.896]  And the media totally slobbering all over President Obama at this sacred event.
[01:40:23.436 --> 01:40:27.979]  Oh, even the seagulls in the sky must be in awe of this coming together of humanity.
[01:40:28.039 --> 01:40:33.523]  Like, it was just this total sycophantic media that we've been experiencing for the last eight years.
[01:40:33.923 --> 01:40:42.630]  And so it's just very, I think, eye-opening for so many people out there who never were able to see how media controls us and programs us.
[01:40:43.190 --> 01:40:46.693]  If there was ever a time for the people to get it, now would be the time.
[01:40:47.281 --> 01:40:53.903]  Well, you know, look, I understand that Chris Matthews gets chills up and down his leg when he sees Barack Obama.
[01:40:54.707 --> 01:40:55.528]  I understand that he lied.
[01:40:55.648 --> 01:40:56.268]  You know, it's fine.
[01:40:56.568 --> 01:40:58.069]  Just don't tell us that you're objective.
[01:40:58.349 --> 01:41:03.072]  We understand, and everybody sees your bias now, after these last eight years, and especially after this election.
[01:41:03.673 --> 01:41:05.274]  And so, it's fine to have a bias.
[01:41:05.374 --> 01:41:06.054]  Just own it.
[01:41:06.574 --> 01:41:19.983]  Tell people where you're coming from, and then support why you're coming from that position, instead of telling lies about people, instead of telling people that lied to us, and telling us that you're objective, that you don't have a point of view, and that you're completely
[01:41:20.563 --> 01:41:28.569]  Sorry, I'm waving goodbye to Barack Obama the last time he's using our American tax dollars to take his family on a bajillion dollar trip.
[01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:29.230]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:34.074]  I think you'll find a way to somehow live off of the government, off of the public money.
[01:41:34.454 --> 01:41:43.321]  This is a guy who was a community organizer before he got into politics and now he's able to afford a $22,000 a month house in Washington, D.C.
[01:41:43.341 --> 01:41:46.544]  so he can stay there and can remain involved in politics.
[01:41:46.604 --> 01:41:48.205]  And build a wall around his rental.
[01:41:49.846 --> 01:41:51.708]  Unfortunately, we've not seen the last of Barack Obama.
[01:41:51.728 --> 01:41:55.831]  He's going to remain around, and he's going to break precedent, as we've never seen before.
[01:41:55.871 --> 01:42:00.894]  But that's a good thing, because he's going to continue, and the Democrat Party is going to continue down this same path.
[01:42:00.914 --> 01:42:03.636]  We've seen Nancy Pelosi say, look, we're not going to change.
[01:42:03.656 --> 01:42:04.717]  Why would we change?
[01:42:04.977 --> 01:42:09.880]  Yeah, you've only lost a thousand seats in the last eight years, elected office throughout the various states.
[01:42:09.901 --> 01:42:11.462]  So why would you change, Nancy Pelosi?
[01:42:12.162 --> 01:42:26.696]  Please, keep going down the path that you're going and to total irrelevancy because everybody understands where you're coming from, everybody understands where the mainstream media is coming from, we understand your bias, and you are not going to be able to play this game anymore that it's true because the New York Times or CNN.
[01:42:27.496 --> 01:42:29.358]  Or ABC, NBC, CBS says it.
[01:42:29.518 --> 01:42:30.699]  It isn't true because they say it.
[01:42:30.719 --> 01:42:32.281]  They're going to have to support what they say.
[01:42:32.581 --> 01:42:34.983]  We're going to understand that they have a bias.
[01:42:35.043 --> 01:42:37.025]  And so I think that's a very healthy thing.
[01:42:37.265 --> 01:42:38.446]  We can now have that discussion.
[01:42:38.667 --> 01:42:45.513]  We're going to see the White House press corps opened up beyond these 49 people who have this little guild going on.
[01:42:45.553 --> 01:42:46.654]  That's truly what that is.
[01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:48.677]  Trying to protect their positions.
[01:42:48.697 --> 01:42:51.362]  They're freaking out, calling it censorship.
[01:42:52.004 --> 01:42:53.106]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:42:53.146 --> 01:42:56.091]  We've got Darren and Margaret that are ready to join us.
[01:42:56.151 --> 01:42:57.814]  Comment on what they've just seen.
[01:42:58.455 --> 01:42:59.557]  Darren and Margaret, your comments.
[01:43:00.623 --> 01:43:02.944]  Well, Darren, I mean, that's got to be the speech of the century.
[01:43:03.064 --> 01:43:07.707]  Obviously teleprompter-free, all heart, and who would have thought it?
[01:43:07.747 --> 01:43:09.909]  You know, he honored our military.
[01:43:10.069 --> 01:43:12.910]  He talked about putting America first and protectionism.
[01:43:13.211 --> 01:43:20.735]  You know, you'd think that these were kind of basic concepts, and yet when you hear them come out of a president's mouth, you really just, it's dumbfounding.
[01:43:20.795 --> 01:43:23.277]  It's just, you know, I was tearing up through the whole speech.
[01:43:23.337 --> 01:43:24.357]  It was a great speech.
[01:43:24.377 --> 01:43:26.939]  A lot of JFK inaugural speech type moments.
[01:43:27.219 --> 01:43:45.709]  You know so and by the way we are editing the highlights of that speech as we speak so we're going to have those up on InfoWars real soon but this is a historic day and and this is the battle to save the Republic and defeat the globalists and there was a lot of globalist type of that was his message to fight the globalists as well.
[01:43:46.290 --> 01:43:48.931]  Historic moment and I thought it was fantastic.
[01:43:49.011 --> 01:43:50.272]  This is a day of celebration.
[01:43:50.552 --> 01:43:58.041]  Well, speaking of globalists, you know, David, I was looking for Bill and Hillary to see if they were in all purple, as you speculated they would be.
[01:43:58.061 --> 01:44:00.924]  It looked like Bill Clinton may have had on a purple tie.
[01:44:00.944 --> 01:44:03.027]  I think she turned purple there.
[01:44:03.127 --> 01:44:04.368]  She saw him being sworn in.
[01:44:04.388 --> 01:44:06.851]  I think she didn't need to have purple that she was wearing.
[01:44:06.891 --> 01:44:08.093]  I think her face turned purple.
[01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:16.617]  I just love that speech that he was giving with all of those, I mean it was directed at everyone that was behind him.
[01:44:16.878 --> 01:44:17.458]  Absolutely.
[01:44:17.758 --> 01:44:25.747]  All the policies you guys put in place, your legacy, it is done, it hasn't been for the people, and then he turns around and Barack Obama's like, good job.
[01:44:26.027 --> 01:44:26.928]  It's an excellent speech.
[01:44:27.028 --> 01:44:40.256]  I believe it was written by Stephen Miller and of course he's written a lot of Trump's stump speeches and was a senior advisor for Senator Sessions who became one of the first supporters of Donald Trump because of the trade and sovereignty issues.
[01:44:40.676 --> 01:44:47.140]  That was something he's been hardcore about and of course Senator Sessions has never supported a presidential candidate before.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:51.323]  That's the first time he ever endorsed anyone and now he will be the Attorney General.
[01:44:51.343 --> 01:44:54.525]  I don't think the confirmation has gone through but I think it will go through.
[01:44:54.565 --> 01:44:55.085]  I don't think they've
[01:44:55.265 --> 01:44:56.606]  We'll leave you with Jay Johnson if a tragedy strikes.
[01:45:11.257 --> 01:45:12.997]  Possibly the most historic moment.
[01:45:13.057 --> 01:45:14.578]  I mean, probably in my lifetime.
[01:45:14.618 --> 01:45:23.480]  But if you looked on the cover of CNN last night, they were featuring El Chapo and trying to dirty up a pastor that had prayed over Donald Trump.
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:25.801]  I mean, it was just like, how could you miss the boat?
[01:45:26.321 --> 01:45:27.241]  So much so.
[01:45:27.301 --> 01:45:32.503]  The big message on the mainstream news media right now is he is the most unpopular president in history.
[01:45:32.563 --> 01:45:34.383]  According to what polls?
[01:45:34.863 --> 01:45:35.404]  Exactly.
[01:45:35.484 --> 01:45:37.924]  Just like the polls that said Hillary was going to win, right?
[01:45:37.944 --> 01:45:38.925]  The day of the election.
[01:45:38.945 --> 01:45:40.125]  80% chance, right?
[01:45:40.145 --> 01:45:40.465]  Correct.
[01:45:41.085 --> 01:45:47.047]  During the speech today, Donald Trump said, when America is united, America is unstoppable.
[01:45:47.367 --> 01:45:50.488]  The mainstream media is trying to tell us that we are divided.
[01:45:50.568 --> 01:45:53.669]  Like, we're more divided now than since the Civil War.
[01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:56.690]  And there's going to be another Civil War waiting around every corner, you know.
[01:45:56.890 --> 01:45:57.930]  We're about to go into Civil War.
[01:45:58.530 --> 01:45:59.171]  I don't buy it.
[01:45:59.391 --> 01:46:01.513]  I think we are united now more than ever.
[01:46:01.553 --> 01:46:04.095]  I think patriotism is making a huge comeback.
[01:46:04.795 --> 01:46:08.499]  And I think that everyone is very, extremely optimistic about the future.
[01:46:08.779 --> 01:46:10.020]  Apart from the left, of course.
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:12.382]  They're always butt hurt and they're always going to have problems.
[01:46:12.442 --> 01:46:15.164]  But I'm very optimistic about the future.
[01:46:15.204 --> 01:46:18.487]  This is a historic moment and I can't wait to see what's next.
[01:46:18.907 --> 01:46:19.347]  No kidding.
[01:46:19.367 --> 01:46:20.348]  Well, you mentioned the left.
[01:46:20.368 --> 01:46:28.250]  You know, I'm of the belief that the cycle of the lies, I mean, we've seen a dissipation happen in the atmosphere where we were able to break through some of those.
[01:46:28.410 --> 01:46:31.532]  And we need, our focus should be now to pull those people over.
[01:46:31.712 --> 01:46:33.252]  But this is, they're doing it for us.
[01:46:33.312 --> 01:46:41.875]  The more they act like fools, the more they protest, burn down their own cities, the more 60 plus Democrats refuse to go to this peaceful transfer of power.
[01:46:42.235 --> 01:46:45.537]  And then they sit out and they boycott Trump's inauguration.
[01:46:45.837 --> 01:46:46.677]  That just helps us.
[01:46:46.877 --> 01:46:48.599]  That's a turnoff to a lot of people.
[01:46:48.639 --> 01:46:49.720]  They think they look silly.
[01:46:50.101 --> 01:46:51.322]  They're unpatriotic.
[01:46:52.103 --> 01:46:53.545]  And it's really disrespectful.
[01:46:53.905 --> 01:46:56.448]  And what it's doing, it's getting recruits on our side.
[01:46:56.548 --> 01:46:57.689]  That's what they're doing in the process.
[01:46:57.889 --> 01:47:01.834]  That's how they lost the election to begin with, and they haven't learned from their mistakes.
[01:47:01.974 --> 01:47:02.314]  Right.
[01:47:02.434 --> 01:47:06.556]  You're talking about also, I wanted to mention this one lady's tweet about the black community.
[01:47:06.656 --> 01:47:16.719]  She was an Iraq war veteran and she was talking about Barack Obama and Congressman Lewis because you know we've seen a lot from Congressman Lewis boycotting the inauguration.
[01:47:17.199 --> 01:47:22.483]  And she said, look, you know, President Obama and Congressman Lewis, they've been in power a very long time.
[01:47:22.503 --> 01:47:25.005]  What have they done for the black communities of America?
[01:47:25.045 --> 01:47:29.629]  They've remained poor and crime ridden and a lot of destruction and hopelessness.
[01:47:29.649 --> 01:47:32.912]  Well, these two men have gotten wealthier and wealthier and wealthier.
[01:47:32.932 --> 01:47:34.333]  It's just empty rhetoric.
[01:47:34.793 --> 01:47:42.215]  John Lewis's district is a total disaster, just like every other Democratic-controlled district and congressional districts across the country.
[01:47:42.735 --> 01:47:43.695]  Total disasters.
[01:47:43.835 --> 01:47:54.838]  They're inner-city ghetto zones, they're crime-ridden, highest crime rates, the strictest gun control laws, and the black ownership of homes and businesses are rock-bottom.
[01:47:55.118 --> 01:47:56.278]  So it's a complete disaster.
[01:47:56.718 --> 01:48:01.900]  And then he says that he is boycotting the inauguration.
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:02.980]  John Lewis, right?
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:05.121]  I don't think so.
[01:48:20.254 --> 01:48:21.354]  That's right, that's right.
[01:48:21.675 --> 01:48:30.037]  And mentioning giving Trump a chance, you know, the inner cities especially, they need somebody on their side, a hero, if you will, to bring jobs back.
[01:48:30.397 --> 01:48:37.359]  Trump hit it on the head, a nation exists to serve its citizens, and these are just and reasonable demands of a righteous people.
[01:48:37.759 --> 01:48:39.600]  You know, imagine that, Darren.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:42.321]  You know, a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[01:48:42.481 --> 01:48:43.081]  Who would have thought?
[01:48:43.181 --> 01:48:44.181]  Revolutionary concept.
[01:48:44.201 --> 01:48:45.221]  Okay, imagine this.
[01:48:47.582 --> 01:48:51.825]  60-plus Republicans boycotting Obama's inauguration.
[01:48:52.525 --> 01:48:53.726]  I mean, it would be the end of the world.
[01:48:53.806 --> 01:48:54.566]  Right, right.
[01:48:54.946 --> 01:48:58.088]  I'm just relieved that I didn't have to hear Beyonce lip-sync today.
[01:48:58.148 --> 01:49:03.971]  You know, honestly, in other news, I thought the singer was really lovely.
[01:49:04.251 --> 01:49:06.433]  She clearly wasn't lip-syncing anything up there.
[01:49:07.613 --> 01:49:11.155]  I can only imagine the pressure that that would have put on a young woman.
[01:49:11.175 --> 01:49:12.016]  Her name escapes me.
[01:49:12.036 --> 01:49:13.877]  We were just watching this before you guys came to us.
[01:49:14.697 --> 01:49:19.762]  Well, the party's just begun, and it will be going on all night, and I believe, are we going to go on till what, midnight tonight?
[01:49:19.782 --> 01:49:20.643]  We're doing like 14-hour shit.
[01:49:20.663 --> 01:49:20.863]  We are.
[01:49:20.883 --> 01:49:22.404]  That's right, a lot of things are going to be happening.
[01:49:22.424 --> 01:49:24.166]  I hear one of the crew go, come on, come on!
[01:49:24.186 --> 01:49:32.513]  One of the things that we're going to be following is to see if there are going to be some counter-executive orders put out by Donald Trump hitting the ground running.
[01:49:32.553 --> 01:49:34.595]  We've had some indications that that's going to be happening.
[01:49:35.175 --> 01:49:40.280]  And of course, what the two of you, Darren and Margaret, alluded to, the fact that people
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:45.565]  In Congressman Lewis's district as well as others, Donald Trump addressed that.
[01:49:45.605 --> 01:49:48.747]  He said, their victories have not been your victories.
[01:49:48.787 --> 01:49:50.589]  Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[01:49:50.649 --> 01:49:52.991]  We're going to change that right here and right now.
[01:49:53.071 --> 01:49:53.552]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.892 --> 01:49:57.595]  We're going to be right back with more live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration.
[01:49:57.676 --> 01:50:00.078]  Donald Trump, now President of the United States.
[01:50:17.751 --> 01:50:25.534]  Joining us now is Michael Schneider of the EconomicCollapseBlog.com, and of course he's a frequent contributor to Infowars.com.
[01:50:26.075 --> 01:50:31.937]  Talk to us about your concerns about what the anarchists are trying to do in terms of promoting martial law.
[01:50:31.997 --> 01:50:35.519]  Yeah, thank you David, and people need to realize that this starts
[01:50:35.939 --> 01:50:46.963]  Tomorrow, the radical left, the election of Donald Trump was perhaps the single most galvanizing moment in the history of the radical left, certainly since the days of Ronald Reagan, where they didn't expect Donald Trump to win.
[01:50:47.003 --> 01:50:56.386]  They kind of treated him as a big joke, but now that they've won, they're fired up, they're ready for battle, they're ready for war, while many, many patriots, many conservatives have kind of gone to sleep.
[01:50:56.666 --> 01:50:59.367]  Many Trump supporters said, hey, he won, so now the battle's over.
[01:50:59.427 --> 01:51:00.948]  The truth is the battle's just beginning.
[01:51:01.428 --> 01:51:12.535]  In fact, an organization known as refusefascism.org recently took out a full page ad in the New York Times talking about how we need, must resist Donald Trump.
[01:51:12.555 --> 01:51:26.545]  It's all funded by the radical left, people like George Soros, all ultimately controlled and dominated by the globalists, but they're being told that Donald Trump is Hitler, that he's the devil, that he must be resisted, basically to the left.
[01:51:27.165 --> 01:51:30.667]  Donald Trump is the personification of everything that's wrong with America.
[01:51:31.048 --> 01:51:36.391]  And so what they plan to do on Inauguration Day, they plan to disrupt the activities as much as possible.
[01:51:36.431 --> 01:51:38.793]  One of the big things they're planning are blockades.
[01:51:38.833 --> 01:51:49.139]  They're planning blockades of the major transportation routes into Washington, D.C., and then the major transportation routes in and across the Inauguration Route.
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:50.020]  So they want to keep
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:50.601]  People are
[01:52:05.476 --> 01:52:09.359]  Much of the inauguration celebration is possible inside.
[01:52:09.379 --> 01:52:12.521]  They want to turn it into a riot, into chaos.
[01:52:12.841 --> 01:52:19.086]  They want to do whatever they can to disrupt things, to upset the proceedings and to get attention for their cause.
[01:52:19.446 --> 01:52:26.831]  Now, of course, they can't stop Donald Trump from being inaugurated, but what they want to do is they want to completely change the narrative of the day.
[01:52:26.871 --> 01:52:30.454]  If you remember past inaugurations, for example, when Barack Obama was inaugurated,
[01:52:30.774 --> 01:52:32.534]  It was a big celebration.
[01:52:32.574 --> 01:52:39.636]  You know, the whole nation came together and Barack Obama got out of the vehicle and walked the parade route and it was peaceful and people were cheering.
[01:52:40.056 --> 01:52:42.497]  They wanted to turn it into the exact opposite.
[01:52:42.637 --> 01:52:46.558]  Chaos and riots and all these things are about provoking a response.
[01:52:46.998 --> 01:52:53.219]  And so they want the National Guard and the authorities to crack down hard so they can say, hey, look, this is martial law.
[01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:54.960]  Look, they really are fascists.
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:04.672]  They're gonna go from a love fest that they had with the media and Barack Obama, they're going to go, look, the country is torn apart by the presidency of Donald Trump.
[01:53:04.772 --> 01:53:08.216]  The media is waiting for this, waiting to pounce on this.
[01:53:26.221 --> 01:53:27.583]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:27.643 --> 01:53:32.789]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo here in Austin and we have in our other studio Darren McBrain and Margaret Howell.
[01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:40.378]  We have just witnessed the inauguration, the swearing-in ceremony of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of the United States.
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:42.120]  It was a great speech.
[01:53:42.201 --> 01:53:43.561]  We've been talking about what he had to say.
[01:53:43.581 --> 01:53:47.564]  We're going to have some clips of that coming up for you, some replays of that as well.
[01:53:47.944 --> 01:54:01.372]  Before we go back to Darren and Margaret and the other studio, I just want to remind you that we also have crew in Washington, D.C., and we'll be going to them shortly, as well as Alex Jones will be giving us broadcasts and reports from Washington, D.C.
[01:54:02.293 --> 01:54:12.140]  One of the ways that you can help to support InfoWars and to help us to get the word out, as we are in Washington, D.C., is to buy what we sell at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:12.181 --> 01:54:16.424]  Things that we have put on sale, things that we have created to support you and your health.
[01:54:16.844 --> 01:54:23.409]  Now, of course, the beginning of the year, we came up with a sale for most of our most popular products.
[01:54:23.449 --> 01:54:29.674]  We have Supermail Vitality, Brain Force Plus, both of those 30% off, along with Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine.
[01:54:30.194 --> 01:54:37.136]  We also have 20% off Secret 12, our vitamin B12 formulation, and Knockouts, our natural sleep formula.
[01:54:37.177 --> 01:54:40.038]  We have many other items that are available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:54:40.078 --> 01:54:53.142]  That sale that we began at the beginning of the year is about to end with the inauguration, but we also added as an inauguration special, and I'm not sure how long this is going to run either, we have InfoWars Select Storable Food, 30 to 40% off.
[01:54:53.202 --> 01:54:55.243]  A great time for you to stock up
[01:54:55.863 --> 01:54:56.584]  We're good to go.
[01:54:56.624 --> 01:54:57.164]  We're good to go.
[01:54:57.184 --> 01:54:57.765]  We're good to go.
[01:54:57.785 --> 01:54:58.285]  We're good to go.
[01:54:58.325 --> 01:54:58.845]  We're good to go.
[01:54:58.865 --> 01:54:59.746]  We're good to go.
[01:54:59.846 --> 01:55:01.307]  We're good to go.
[01:55:01.327 --> 01:55:01.848]  We're good to go.
[01:55:01.868 --> 01:55:02.348]  We're good to go.
[01:55:02.368 --> 01:55:02.989]  We're good to go.
[01:55:03.009 --> 01:55:03.449]  We're good to go.
[01:55:03.469 --> 01:55:04.390]  We're good to go.
[01:55:04.410 --> 01:55:04.910]  We're good to go.
[01:55:05.110 --> 01:55:05.871]  We're good to go.
[01:55:05.891 --> 01:55:06.351]  We're good to go.
[01:55:06.371 --> 01:55:06.831]  We're good to go.
[01:55:06.851 --> 01:55:07.892]  We're good to go.
[01:55:07.972 --> 01:55:08.853]  We're good to go.
[01:55:08.953 --> 01:55:09.994]  We're good to go.
[01:55:10.014 --> 01:55:11.054]  We're good to go.
[01:55:11.075 --> 01:55:11.675]  We're good to go.
[01:55:11.735 --> 01:55:12.976]  We're good to go.
[01:55:13.016 --> 01:55:13.436]  We're good to go.
[01:55:13.456 --> 01:55:13.957]  We're good to go.
[01:55:13.977 --> 01:55:14.397]  We're good to go.
[01:55:14.437 --> 01:55:14.857]  We're good to go.
[01:55:14.877 --> 01:55:15.258]  We're good to go.
[01:55:15.318 --> 01:55:15.818]  We're good to go.
[01:55:15.838 --> 01:55:16.338]  We're good to go.
[01:55:16.358 --> 01:55:16.739]  We're good to go.
[01:55:16.779 --> 01:55:17.479]  We're good to go.
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:18.380]  We're good to go.
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.421]  We're good to go.
[01:55:19.441 --> 01:55:20.081]  We're good to go.
[01:55:20.101 --> 01:55:20.501]  We're good to go.
[01:55:20.521 --> 01:55:20.942]  We're good to go.
[01:55:20.962 --> 01:55:21.502]  We're good to go.
[01:55:21.542 --> 01:55:21.642]  We're
[01:55:25.748 --> 01:55:26.568]  Great quality food.
[01:55:26.648 --> 01:55:27.669]  No GMO.
[01:55:27.829 --> 01:55:29.670]  It is resealable once you open it.
[01:55:29.850 --> 01:55:32.011]  And again, it has a 25-year shelf life.
[01:55:32.031 --> 01:55:40.594]  That's one way to not only provide for shortages, but to also smooth out the bumps in the road that go along with price increases.
[01:55:40.674 --> 01:55:42.795]  And that supports InfoWars at the same time.
[01:55:42.855 --> 01:55:46.677]  Again, look at the specials we have at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:55:47.813 --> 01:55:49.753]  And we have some reports, of course.
[01:55:49.773 --> 01:55:52.994]  We've got an article here from Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:55:53.154 --> 01:55:58.035]  Anti-Trump protesters are building walls to stop Trump protesters from even getting into the inauguration.
[01:55:58.255 --> 01:56:00.576]  That's a great way to put it, as Watson points out.
[01:56:00.836 --> 01:56:02.416]  But I thought they were against walls.
[01:56:02.456 --> 01:56:03.696]  I thought walls were racist.
[01:56:05.337 --> 01:56:06.197]  Your comments, Darren?
[01:56:07.317 --> 01:56:07.857]  Oh, exactly.
[01:56:07.877 --> 01:56:14.619]  I was just thinking about the 60-plus Democrats that are boycotting the inauguration, so they're not in Washington, D.C.
[01:56:14.679 --> 01:56:15.019]  today.
[01:56:15.519 --> 01:56:16.839]  I'd say we're off to a good start.
[01:56:18.268 --> 01:56:24.932]  Well, you know, Trump really smacked them down, I think, in a sense with that inclusive speech that he said.
[01:56:24.952 --> 01:56:30.215]  He said, this is not about transferring power from one person to another or from one party to another.
[01:56:30.495 --> 01:56:34.857]  You partisan hacks who don't even want to show up for the peaceful transition of power.
[01:56:35.197 --> 01:56:38.079]  This is about transferring power back to the people.
[01:56:38.259 --> 01:56:39.980]  That was a great point that he made.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:46.224]  And the fact that they've come out and say that they're going to stall at every opportunity, they're going to block and stall.
[01:56:46.624 --> 01:56:56.251]  So they're basically just letting their constituents know that they're not going to be working on their behalf, they're not going to be doing anything, they're just going to be there to hold things up and collect a paycheck.
[01:56:56.791 --> 01:57:04.896]  And this is why Donald Trump, this is why people resonated with his message and wanted him in there, because he's saying, those type of people are out.
[01:57:05.477 --> 01:57:06.657]  I've got a prediction too.
[01:57:07.038 --> 01:57:08.759]  Get those people out with our next election, yes sir.
[01:57:09.179 --> 01:57:13.562]  I say that Donald Trump will take less vacations than any president in history.
[01:57:13.803 --> 01:57:14.023]  Right.
[01:57:14.403 --> 01:57:14.783]  I agree.
[01:57:14.903 --> 01:57:21.128]  I was thinking about that when he was there walking off with Barack Obama and Obama was boarding the plane for the last time.
[01:57:21.728 --> 01:57:29.254]  Just thinking how many times Barack Obama went to go play golf or when things just got a little too tough he would hit the green.
[01:57:29.354 --> 01:57:32.877]  Donald Trump is obsessed with working.
[01:57:33.396 --> 01:57:33.816]  Absolutely.
[01:57:34.317 --> 01:57:34.957]  We're going to be back.
[01:57:35.157 --> 01:57:38.940]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Darren McBreen, Margaret Howell here in Austin.
[01:57:39.341 --> 01:57:47.047]  We're going to be joined by our crew in Washington, D.C., and we're going to have highlights of Donald Trump's swearing in with us right after the break.
[01:57:47.087 --> 01:57:47.507]  Stay with us.
[01:57:53.452 --> 01:57:54.953]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:57:54.973 --> 01:57:58.056]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:03.675 --> 01:58:05.196]  Migrants are racing for the U.S.
[01:58:05.276 --> 01:58:07.518]  border right before Trump is taking office.
[01:58:07.538 --> 01:58:12.342]  There's an article that's up on the Drudge Report that talks about how illegals are coming for the U.S.
[01:58:12.422 --> 01:58:14.544]  border in lieu of a Trump victory.
[01:58:14.604 --> 01:58:16.286]  He's taking office tomorrow, folks.
[01:58:16.486 --> 01:58:18.227]  Migrants that are trying to sneak into the U.S.
[01:58:18.408 --> 01:58:22.751]  on the last day of what they see because they realize that a wall is in fact coming.
[01:58:23.152 --> 01:58:26.855]  These challenges are nothing compared to a bigger fear they have that someday soon U.S.
[01:58:26.915 --> 01:58:28.256]  President-elect Donald Trump
[01:58:28.456 --> 01:58:30.539]  We'll build that wall and keep him out altogether.
[01:58:30.599 --> 01:58:37.548]  So, before Trump takes office tomorrow, they're racing against time, riding a freight train up to the border to look for a way across.
[01:58:37.749 --> 01:58:43.497]  In the town, near a frontier, a group of Hondurans warn themselves near a fire of trash in the early morning cold.
[01:58:43.797 --> 01:58:51.719]  There's an article that YouTube has put up showing these migrants ready to jump the train in the event that it slows down, and I've got news for you folks.
[01:58:51.759 --> 01:58:57.801]  That wall is coming, but it looks like migrants are feeling the burn, literally, and racing for the border.
[01:58:58.061 --> 01:59:00.422]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:59:04.423 --> 01:59:10.325]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:14.584 --> 01:59:20.790]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:59:37.208 --> 01:59:40.271]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[01:59:41.392 --> 01:59:44.054]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[01:59:44.074 --> 01:59:47.878]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[01:59:48.278 --> 01:59:50.320]  That I will faithfully execute.
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:53.142]  That I will faithfully execute.
[01:59:53.382 --> 01:59:56.065]  The office of President of the United States.
[01:59:56.445 --> 01:59:59.387]  The office of President of the United States.
[01:59:59.788 --> 02:00:01.749]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[02:00:02.249 --> 02:00:04.431]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[02:00:04.811 --> 02:00:06.873]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[02:00:07.313 --> 02:00:09.114]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[02:00:09.395 --> 02:00:11.396]  The Constitution of the United States.
[02:00:11.516 --> 02:00:13.878]  The Constitution of the United States.
[02:00:14.038 --> 02:00:14.859]  So help me God.
[02:00:15.099 --> 02:00:15.940]  So help me God.
[02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:17.721]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:36.509]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[02:02:02.662 --> 02:02:17.242]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[02:02:22.995 --> 02:02:36.661]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[02:02:38.802 --> 02:02:45.544]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[02:02:48.177 --> 02:02:49.779]  We will face challenges.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.062]  We will confront hardships.
[02:02:52.683 --> 02:02:54.725]  But we will get the job done.
[02:02:56.187 --> 02:03:02.374]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[02:03:03.539 --> 02:03:14.269]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:17.232]  They have been magnificent.
[02:03:17.552 --> 02:03:17.933]  Thank you.
[02:03:25.472 --> 02:03:29.776]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[02:03:30.677 --> 02:03:39.086]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another.
[02:03:39.767 --> 02:03:47.535]  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.
[02:04:21.897 --> 02:04:30.521]  If there's private information that someone is blackmailing a public figure, and the public figure or someone takes it to the intelligence agencies, you would think it would be private.
[02:04:30.981 --> 02:04:34.763]  And really, this is so important that I think whoever leaked it should be prosecuted.
[02:04:35.103 --> 02:04:36.124]  Someone should go to jail.
[02:04:36.684 --> 02:04:40.026]  If this was an intelligence agency had to talk to the media, they should go to jail.
[02:04:40.446 --> 02:04:43.167]  If this was part of the Obama administration, they should go to jail.
[02:04:43.187 --> 02:04:46.669]  Alright, that's an interesting point that Rand Paul makes as he's talking to Neil Cavuto.
[02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:48.470]  Joining us now is Lionel.
[02:04:48.490 --> 02:04:50.331]  Lionel, what is your take on that?
[02:04:51.437 --> 02:04:52.018]  Fascinating.
[02:04:52.898 --> 02:04:57.303]  It is fascinating how this started.
[02:04:57.643 --> 02:05:00.286]  David, where do we begin?
[02:05:00.966 --> 02:05:04.290]  I thought that it couldn't get any more complicated before.
[02:05:05.010 --> 02:05:09.775]  Bill Clinton, I thought, my God, look at the media, they're after Bill Clinton and the right wing and the left wing.
[02:05:09.795 --> 02:05:12.217]  It was very simple, right wing, left wing media.
[02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:13.398]  I don't know.
[02:05:32.378 --> 02:05:38.901]  Who completely upset the apple cart and poses an existential threat to everyone.
[02:05:39.602 --> 02:05:51.108]  And so consequently, he is going to be the beneficiary of this frisson, this calamity, this complete unraveling of everyone.
[02:05:51.148 --> 02:05:55.130]  He can just sit back, say nothing, and watch
[02:05:56.210 --> 02:05:56.971]  What has happened?
[02:05:57.191 --> 02:05:58.012]  Rand Paul.
[02:05:58.653 --> 02:06:01.135]  Rand Paul is, he makes a lot of sense.
[02:06:01.816 --> 02:06:02.396]  I think.
[02:06:03.337 --> 02:06:10.044]  What I used to think makes sense, makes sense, but Trump intel leakers should go to jail.
[02:06:10.745 --> 02:06:11.105]  First.
[02:06:12.246 --> 02:06:17.530]  Let us stop with this idea, this fetish, David, that we have about putting people in prison and in jail.
[02:06:17.991 --> 02:06:18.971]  Let's just stop this.
[02:06:19.492 --> 02:06:30.520]  When you allow this trope or meme to be suggested that whistleblowers, or excuse me, that people who leak should go to jail, that poses a very, very serious threat.
[02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:35.944]  So the first reaction to all First Amendment scholars and lovers of liberty should be, wait a minute, stop.
[02:06:35.964 --> 02:06:38.006]  Barack Obama with using the 100-year-old 1917 Espionage Act
[02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:45.570]  Put more journalists and whistleblowers in than all the other presidents in the last 100 years.
[02:06:45.970 --> 02:06:47.851]  Combined, he put them into jail.
[02:06:47.911 --> 02:07:00.415]  So, there's been a lot of move against whistleblowers, and I think the interesting thing in defense of Rand Paul, when people said, oh, we've got to put Snowden in jail, we've got to put WikiLeaks and Julian Assange in jail.
[02:07:00.455 --> 02:07:03.456]  He said, oh, fine, you want to put them in jail for releasing that information?
[02:07:03.476 --> 02:07:10.038]  Then fine, you put the people in the NSA, whose crimes they exposed, put them in jail as well, okay?
[02:07:19.594 --> 02:07:20.315]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:20.655 --> 02:07:21.795]  He was a nice guy, actually.
[02:07:21.815 --> 02:07:22.276]  You like him?
[02:07:23.616 --> 02:07:24.877]  Oh, that's good.
[02:07:24.977 --> 02:07:25.637]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:25.677 --> 02:07:26.138]  Nice guy.
[02:07:26.498 --> 02:07:34.222]  I know now, from top people, that you actually are for real, and you understand you're in danger, and you understand what you're doing, is epic.
[02:07:34.262 --> 02:07:35.742]  Your reputation's amazing.
[02:07:36.183 --> 02:07:37.543]  I will not let you down.
[02:07:37.703 --> 02:07:40.565]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:07:41.125 --> 02:07:45.886]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year and a year or two years.
[02:07:45.946 --> 02:07:48.607]  Let's give me a little bit of a time to run things.
[02:07:48.667 --> 02:07:53.048]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[02:07:53.068 --> 02:07:55.088]  He said he was going to do it, and he did a great job.
[02:07:55.108 --> 02:07:56.509]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[02:07:56.549 --> 02:07:58.169]  So while we're there, you probably read it.
[02:07:58.209 --> 02:08:00.270]  It was in Drudge, who's great, by the way.
[02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:01.550]  Drudge is amazing.
[02:08:02.210 --> 02:08:05.812]  But the story in Drudge, and big story, it's all over the place now.
[02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:09.553]  Guys swimming across, in big bags of stuff.
[02:08:09.573 --> 02:08:10.314]  It's drugs.
[02:08:11.054 --> 02:08:14.255]  Swimming across the river, right?
[02:08:14.956 --> 02:08:15.756]  Swimming around the camps.
[02:08:16.296 --> 02:08:18.057]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[02:08:18.677 --> 02:08:20.498]  They're jumping in, they just jumped in the raft.
[02:08:20.518 --> 02:08:21.398]  They're coming in 1, 2, 3, 4.
[02:08:23.359 --> 02:08:24.720]  They have big satchels.
[02:08:25.695 --> 02:08:31.280]  And actually the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:35.143]  Because they're showing this on camera, the guys carrying bags of stuff.
[02:08:35.203 --> 02:08:35.583]  It was drugs.
[02:08:35.603 --> 02:08:42.709]  Thank you.
[02:08:42.729 --> 02:08:45.131]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America.
[02:08:45.171 --> 02:08:46.071]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:08:46.512 --> 02:08:48.293]  You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that.
[02:08:48.353 --> 02:08:48.694]  Thank you.
[02:08:49.314 --> 02:08:49.975]  Thank you very much.
[02:08:51.036 --> 02:08:55.479]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:56.099 --> 02:08:57.580]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:09:05.605 --> 02:09:10.888]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:09:11.709 --> 02:09:14.571]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:17.415 --> 02:09:22.717]  And as you heard, ruffles and flourishes and hail to the chief, Donald Trump is now the 45th President of the United States.
[02:09:23.197 --> 02:09:25.538]  He was sworn in at noon eastern time.
[02:09:25.578 --> 02:09:29.760]  We just played a reclip of that swearing-in process at the beginning of the hour.
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:35.202]  We're going to go to our reporters, first to Alex Jones in Washington, D.C.
[02:09:35.242 --> 02:09:39.724]  Before we go to Alex, I just want to remind you that we have a President Trump 16x20 lithograph.
[02:09:41.565 --> 02:09:42.085]  That's right.
[02:09:42.105 --> 02:09:42.326]  It's 1995.
[02:09:42.366 --> 02:09:45.687]  You'll see that it's a limited edition at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:09:45.767 --> 02:09:47.648]  It is exclusive to InfoWars.
[02:09:47.989 --> 02:09:54.912]  This is done by the official RNC portrait artist, and I can tell you it is very detailed, a great looking poster.
[02:09:54.932 --> 02:09:57.754]  I've seen the one that we have framed here in the hallway.
[02:09:57.814 --> 02:09:59.875]  That is a great looking poster.
[02:09:59.895 --> 02:10:05.558]  And again, it's 1995, 16 by 20, limited edition, exclusive to InfoWars.
[02:10:05.618 --> 02:10:08.680]  And joining us now is Alex Jones from Washington, D.C.
[02:10:10.967 --> 02:10:11.627]  Well, thank you, David.
[02:10:11.647 --> 02:10:13.008]  Yes, it's an amazing print.
[02:10:13.108 --> 02:10:15.850]  I'm shocked that the guy's a listener, a big fan, and very famous.
[02:10:16.150 --> 02:10:18.472]  He's the official, you know, guy that does it for the Republican Party.
[02:10:19.032 --> 02:10:21.513]  And, of course, the famous drawing of Ronald Reagan with a cowboy hat.
[02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:22.794]  That's him, but that's a side issue.
[02:10:23.174 --> 02:10:30.059]  I'm just going to take over here for about 10 minutes and hand the baton back to you guys, and I'm going to come in later in the 14-hour marathon broadcast with you guys.
[02:10:30.459 --> 02:10:36.482]  First off, let me just take a deep breath here and break down what just happened here today.
[02:10:36.743 --> 02:10:37.403]  Undoubtedly,
[02:10:38.365 --> 02:10:39.565]  This was Providence.
[02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:42.366]  This was America's destiny being invoked.
[02:10:43.046 --> 02:10:50.349]  This was Trump declaring the birthright of this republic that George Washington talked about and that Providence that started back in 1776.
[02:10:50.449 --> 02:10:53.530]  He invoked it.
[02:10:53.610 --> 02:10:56.711]  It was so historical and I knew they were going to invoke it.
[02:10:56.751 --> 02:10:57.971]  It just came into my mind.
[02:10:58.783 --> 02:11:04.866]  And I knew, even though he hasn't given a speech, and I haven't talked to Trump about this, I knew what was about to happen.
[02:11:04.906 --> 02:11:08.788]  And I said, I've got a tweet that they're going to re-invoke
[02:11:09.629 --> 02:11:10.510]  Uh, the birthright.
[02:11:10.570 --> 02:11:13.492]  I just feel it, because that's really what this is.
[02:11:13.993 --> 02:11:17.475]  And then the media was asking me, even the New York Times had seen the tweet, they said, did you talk to Trump?
[02:11:17.716 --> 02:11:19.177]  And how did you know it wasn't a speech nobody else did?
[02:11:19.197 --> 02:11:20.378]  And I said, no.
[02:11:20.718 --> 02:11:21.539]  This is Americana.
[02:11:21.559 --> 02:11:22.019]  Do you understand?
[02:11:22.039 --> 02:11:22.960]  We're reading the same book.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:23.940]  It's the same spirit.
[02:11:24.361 --> 02:11:26.022]  So I will tell them when I talk about Trump.
[02:11:26.182 --> 02:11:27.363]  The spirit of America.
[02:11:27.583 --> 02:11:28.744]  Can you feel it rising?
[02:11:29.345 --> 02:11:30.205]  Trump feels it.
[02:11:30.366 --> 02:11:30.966]  He knows it.
[02:11:31.326 --> 02:11:31.927]  He loves it.
[02:11:32.307 --> 02:11:38.432]  And he wants to serve the people, and empower the people, and have America be incredibly wealthy again, and empower the globe.
[02:11:39.221 --> 02:11:44.985]  Back when we had 50% of the world's wealth just 30 years ago, we were sending more money to companies than we are now, and more industry.
[02:11:45.305 --> 02:11:50.068]  Now all we send is corporate, the ballistic monopoly men.
[02:11:50.248 --> 02:11:51.448]  They do not want us to be prosperous.
[02:11:51.508 --> 02:11:57.252]  And so, the message we heard in this speech has been my message for over a decade.
[02:11:58.365 --> 02:11:59.286]  I mean, longer than that.
[02:11:59.506 --> 02:12:01.968]  But this is Americanism versus globalism.
[02:12:02.008 --> 02:12:04.471]  So Trump isn't reading from my sheet of music.
[02:12:04.851 --> 02:12:06.893]  It's the sheet of music that's reality.
[02:12:07.153 --> 02:12:09.135]  And that's why it's so similar to what I say on the show.
[02:12:09.395 --> 02:12:10.556]  Don't you hear Trump say later?
[02:12:10.937 --> 02:12:12.778]  Okay, and yes, Trump, I was going to host the show.
[02:12:12.798 --> 02:12:13.219]  He told me.
[02:12:13.379 --> 02:12:15.000]  But let's just move past all that.
[02:12:15.441 --> 02:12:19.304]  What really matters here is that the people are so awake.
[02:12:19.384 --> 02:12:20.305]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[02:12:20.405 --> 02:12:23.068]  Every second person I walk by is a listener.
[02:12:23.528 --> 02:12:24.809]  I mean, it is blowing my mind.
[02:12:24.849 --> 02:12:25.769]  You've seen the live feeds.
[02:12:26.289 --> 02:12:35.074]  The amount of young people, the amount of teenagers that are listeners, this is indicative of the huge, incredible awakening that is happening on a planetary scale, not just here.
[02:12:35.134 --> 02:12:43.998]  So make no mistake, this revolution against globalism, this revolution against globalism is something that belongs to the people.
[02:12:44.198 --> 02:12:44.938]  And Trump said that.
[02:12:45.178 --> 02:12:46.659]  This revolution is about you.
[02:12:47.019 --> 02:12:48.100]  You are what empowers it.
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:49.240]  You are the future.
[02:12:49.781 --> 02:12:52.342]  And we're going to get out of your way and let you
[02:12:52.972 --> 02:12:54.014]  Have your destiny.
[02:12:54.254 --> 02:12:55.115]  Have your dreams.
[02:12:55.296 --> 02:13:00.143]  And we understand America's special in that destiny, and that as America goes, the rest of the world goes.
[02:13:00.764 --> 02:13:03.908]  Washington envisioned all of this in his farewell address.
[02:13:03.928 --> 02:13:06.372]  He saw this in Providence.
[02:13:07.890 --> 02:13:09.110]  And now it's all come true.
[02:13:09.411 --> 02:13:10.371]  The enemy knew that.
[02:13:10.411 --> 02:13:12.212]  That's why they always evoke the occult.
[02:13:12.292 --> 02:13:12.612]  Evoke.
[02:13:12.632 --> 02:13:13.992]  Don't talk about God or Christ.
[02:13:14.032 --> 02:13:14.993]  Don't talk about providence.
[02:13:15.353 --> 02:13:20.675]  Don't say, you know, America is great and all this stuff to demoralize us not to have this birthright.
[02:13:20.835 --> 02:13:28.117]  It's why they teach you in school how horrible, you know, the idea of American providence and manifest destiny and all of this is.
[02:13:28.157 --> 02:13:30.398]  And talk about the problems and crimes associated.
[02:13:30.618 --> 02:13:33.379]  There's problems and crimes associated with any humans or any movement.
[02:13:33.599 --> 02:13:39.002]  But overall, the greater destiny to defeat tyranny worldwide and to stop a great evil in the future.
[02:13:39.362 --> 02:13:48.306]  I believe it's going to be this republic in the future that defeats the entire world government anti-human eugenics-based technocracy system.
[02:13:48.346 --> 02:13:49.787]  So, we're here.
[02:13:49.827 --> 02:13:52.108]  This is a giant victory for humanity.
[02:13:52.228 --> 02:13:53.108]  It is massive.
[02:13:53.128 --> 02:13:58.471]  And looking at Michelle and looking at Obama up on the Jumbotron,
[02:13:59.830 --> 02:14:06.834]  When they were singing the Star-Spangled Banner, Obama, with that arrogant, smug feeling that he's better than everybody, looked like he was dying.
[02:14:06.854 --> 02:14:07.674]  He had a fake smile.
[02:14:07.694 --> 02:14:16.399]  Michelle was frowning the entire time because these are cult members who were put in power by the globalists so that they could help destroy the country and divide the nation.
[02:14:16.719 --> 02:14:20.581]  They are absolutely evil and want poor people not to have a future.
[02:14:20.601 --> 02:14:23.643]  That's why he goes to Africa and says, you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[02:14:24.597 --> 02:14:31.341]  Because he is literally there to hurt poor people across the board and they needed that face though as their cover to carry it out.
[02:14:31.661 --> 02:14:42.846]  Donald Trump right now is making hundreds of phone calls a day trying to get jobs into Detroit, trying to get jobs into Atlanta, trying to get jobs into all these places in the Midwest as well.
[02:14:43.307 --> 02:14:46.328]  Very, very, very exciting stuff is happening.
[02:14:46.889 --> 02:14:53.372]  This is just an incredible time to be alive and I cannot, I cannot stress to everybody how historical this is because
[02:14:54.165 --> 02:15:07.913]  Everything the New World Order has done has been designed to bring this country down because they can't have a big, free, open, wealthy nation-state with a big, fat, middle-class, upwardly mobile people inside this impoverished, anti-human world government system they're establishing.
[02:15:08.513 --> 02:15:11.014]  The American system is too much competition for them.
[02:15:11.074 --> 02:15:12.435]  They admit that in the White Papers.
[02:15:12.635 --> 02:15:16.417]  The British government 200 years ago wrote they couldn't compete with the American system.
[02:15:17.018 --> 02:15:19.359]  And again, the British now are throwing off globalism.
[02:15:19.499 --> 02:15:21.180]  They're throwing off these monopoly systems.
[02:15:22.105 --> 02:15:24.147]  So this is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:15:24.287 --> 02:15:25.748]  It is an amazing time to be alive.
[02:15:25.788 --> 02:15:28.591]  And it is, quite frankly, so humbling and stunning.
[02:15:29.331 --> 02:15:35.517]  The fact that we go through these crowds of people, people of every race, color, creed, are all just humans with red blood.
[02:15:35.897 --> 02:15:44.985]  This is breaking the will of the media that's trying to create racial division and trying to say that if you're not a white person, you can't, you know, have guns or private property or a future.
[02:15:45.285 --> 02:15:47.167]  You don't have the American birthright.
[02:15:47.527 --> 02:15:49.849]  You don't have a future of wealth.
[02:15:50.169 --> 02:15:51.389]  That's your enemy, that's racist.
[02:15:51.429 --> 02:15:59.792]  This is a cult programming to make people poor and make them the slaves of the globalists who all over the world will play different groups off against each other.
[02:15:59.812 --> 02:16:02.333]  If it's Ukraine, they'll play Catholic off against Orthodox.
[02:16:02.753 --> 02:16:08.395]  Or if it's a country in Africa, they'll play the Christians off against the, you know, the animists or the Muslims or vice versa.
[02:16:08.655 --> 02:16:14.436]  It's all divide and conquer because the elite are destroying nations trying to make us poor.
[02:16:14.496 --> 02:16:16.097]  So, America,
[02:16:17.046 --> 02:16:17.627]  We're good.
[02:16:34.713 --> 02:16:40.598]  began to come back from the dead in the last few months and now has come back to life.
[02:16:40.638 --> 02:16:47.744]  The phoenix is coming up right now and how powerful that phoenix is, how incredible that destiny is.
[02:16:48.562 --> 02:16:49.383]  It's up to us.
[02:16:49.963 --> 02:16:52.165]  We are what breathes life into the spirit.
[02:16:52.205 --> 02:16:52.886]  Get into us.
[02:16:53.126 --> 02:16:54.987]  And the enemy knows everything's energy.
[02:16:55.248 --> 02:17:01.213]  You see, forget all the religious books and all the stuff you can hear from the preachers who are there to control the paradigm.
[02:17:01.713 --> 02:17:06.137]  The enemy wants to destroy our spirit, make us feel weak, so we don't take our birthright and destiny.
[02:17:06.557 --> 02:17:09.520]  We're taking the destiny in our hands.
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:11.182]  We're breathing life into it.
[02:17:11.462 --> 02:17:13.504]  And those devil worshippers out there, the enemy.
[02:17:13.684 --> 02:17:15.266]  Chuckie Schumer, devil worshipper.
[02:17:15.987 --> 02:17:17.268]  Obama, devil worshipper.
[02:17:17.308 --> 02:17:17.888]  It's well known.
[02:17:18.089 --> 02:17:19.530]  These are devil worshippers.
[02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:21.012]  What's a devil worshipper?
[02:17:21.172 --> 02:17:22.293]  They want to hurt other people.
[02:17:22.353 --> 02:17:23.214]  They want to be number one.
[02:17:23.414 --> 02:17:24.795]  They don't like to see somebody succeed.
[02:17:25.276 --> 02:17:25.596]  Okay?
[02:17:25.936 --> 02:17:27.698]  What's somebody that wants prosperity and renaissance?
[02:17:27.898 --> 02:17:28.499]  They want wealth.
[02:17:28.679 --> 02:17:29.360]  A cornucopia.
[02:17:29.580 --> 02:17:32.823]  They're not jealous of somebody who's got a big house or a good-looking wife or vice versa.
[02:17:33.023 --> 02:17:36.046]  As long as you don't take something from me, I think your success is great.
[02:17:36.446 --> 02:17:44.814]  These people are devil worshippers and what happened today was the chief executive invited God back in and said, the door's open.
[02:17:45.275 --> 02:17:47.557]  And instead of the people, the door is open now to you.
[02:17:47.877 --> 02:17:51.841]  If you want this birthright, if you want goodness, we've all got to be good.
[02:17:52.121 --> 02:17:53.082]  We've got to come together.
[02:17:53.797 --> 02:17:58.221]  And we've gotta, if you're black hire white people, if you're white hire black people, whatever!
[02:17:58.441 --> 02:18:03.705]  We gotta come together about issues that we stand for, what we believe in, and transcend all the control.
[02:18:04.066 --> 02:18:12.573]  The media pushed way too hard with all the race garbage, now they're saying he's a Russian spy, now they're saying they've got communiques with him and the Russians, and literally now, he tells!
[02:18:13.673 --> 02:18:14.894]  It's not just Maxine Waters.
[02:18:15.054 --> 02:18:18.675]  The New York Times now says that Putin actually told him Hillary was crooked.
[02:18:18.956 --> 02:18:19.696]  That's right, America.
[02:18:19.936 --> 02:18:21.076]  You can't have your own ideas.
[02:18:21.137 --> 02:18:22.117]  You can't have a strong leader.
[02:18:22.397 --> 02:18:24.838]  The Russians are the reason Trump got elected.
[02:18:25.038 --> 02:18:26.719]  And everything comes from the Russians.
[02:18:26.979 --> 02:18:28.080]  Everybody knows that's BS.
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:31.361]  Nothing against the Russians, but we... America invents a lot of stuff, too.
[02:18:31.721 --> 02:18:32.642]  We come up with a lot of stuff.
[02:18:33.082 --> 02:18:34.383]  Yeah, I mean, give me a break.
[02:18:34.843 --> 02:18:36.824]  You don't think we can't come up with crooked Hillary?
[02:18:37.324 --> 02:18:39.025]  Hell, somebody with a lobotomy can come up with that.
[02:18:39.325 --> 02:18:41.006]  Gotta be that smart to come up with crooked Hillary.
[02:18:42.509 --> 02:18:43.910]  So this is history happening right now.
[02:18:43.930 --> 02:18:52.656]  I'm going to skip this network break and David Knight and The Crooked Pop whenever they want here, but I'm going to go get settled down in an office and just take a shower or something and just get on my knees and pray to God.
[02:18:52.976 --> 02:18:53.556]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:18:53.576 --> 02:18:58.960]  I want to get in a room by myself and hit my knees and start crying because this is so good.
[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:02.122]  And I'm telling you, man, the evil is going to strike back.
[02:19:02.142 --> 02:19:03.083]  We got to be watching them.
[02:19:03.303 --> 02:19:05.084]  We got to be ready, but we know who they are.
[02:19:05.284 --> 02:19:06.165]  We know their plan.
[02:19:06.525 --> 02:19:07.266]  And I got to say it.
[02:19:07.626 --> 02:19:08.686]  It's been InfoWars.
[02:19:09.027 --> 02:19:12.229]  It's been InfoWars and you the people and our analysis.
[02:19:13.081 --> 02:19:16.602]  has led the way as the blueprint battle plan to blow the hell out of them.
[02:19:16.902 --> 02:19:18.422]  I'll tell you, people always want me to take credit.
[02:19:18.702 --> 02:19:21.343]  I'm a humble person, but we need to take credit just to know what we're doing is working.
[02:19:21.803 --> 02:19:29.024]  InfoWars, and our guests, and myself, and you the listeners, the eyes and ears on the ground, and Matt Drudge, and all of us together are the InfoWar.
[02:19:29.484 --> 02:19:33.765]  We are the blueprint of the operating system that just kicked the New World Order's ass!
[02:19:35.686 --> 02:19:36.346]  We got it!
[02:19:37.126 --> 02:19:41.467]  It's America 2.0, supercharged, ready, coming, committed!
[02:19:42.088 --> 02:19:46.549]  And our spirit trumps yours a thousand to one, and our president's even got the name Trump.
[02:19:46.889 --> 02:19:47.789]  So get ready!
[02:19:47.809 --> 02:19:51.870]  Yeah!
[02:19:52.270 --> 02:19:55.711]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[02:19:55.991 --> 02:19:58.432]  Hey, what's the get in here?
[02:19:58.452 --> 02:20:00.092]  Hey, you guys feel the energy?
[02:20:01.372 --> 02:20:04.113]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[02:20:04.873 --> 02:20:05.994]  God bless you, sir.
[02:20:06.014 --> 02:20:06.554]  God bless you.
[02:20:07.274 --> 02:20:07.894]  God bless you.
[02:20:08.559 --> 02:20:10.000]  Hey, it's okay to love freedom.
[02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:11.161]  It's okay to believe.
[02:20:11.181 --> 02:20:12.001]  It's okay to be strong.
[02:20:12.522 --> 02:20:13.182]  Because here's the deal.
[02:20:14.103 --> 02:20:16.885]  We're not just getting hyped up by Trump and then feeling good.
[02:20:16.925 --> 02:20:17.946]  We have the tools.
[02:20:18.426 --> 02:20:19.246]  We have the means.
[02:20:19.407 --> 02:20:20.267]  We have the history.
[02:20:20.467 --> 02:20:21.288]  We got the pedigree.
[02:20:21.328 --> 02:20:22.048]  We got it all.
[02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:23.689]  Everybody here is America.
[02:20:24.170 --> 02:20:31.375]  And as long as you see the globalists bring people in, turn them against America, we're going to be able to bring a lot of people in once they're not getting brainwashed as soon as they get here.
[02:20:32.455 --> 02:20:33.716]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[02:20:33.756 --> 02:20:34.197]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:20:34.457 --> 02:20:35.177]  I'm with Breitbart.
[02:20:35.197 --> 02:20:36.278]  What did you think of the speech?
[02:20:36.338 --> 02:20:37.499]  He really laid the wood to them.
[02:20:38.384 --> 02:20:44.805]  He laid the wood to them, but he empowered the people and let them know you are this revolution, you are the victory, and...
[02:20:46.191 --> 02:20:56.939]  He just brought what everything George Washington envisioned back, America 2.0, and just basically rebooted and launched the system, and it came out of there like a fiery phoenix, fire-breathing dragon.
[02:20:56.959 --> 02:20:59.061]  The globalists are crapping their drawers right now.
[02:20:59.301 --> 02:21:07.548]  This was pure Americana, and trailblazing, and science, and vision, and just absolutely empowering this country.
[02:21:07.568 --> 02:21:08.409]  He's under globalism.
[02:21:09.623 --> 02:21:15.626]  The decision was made to just shut us down and ship it overseas and parlay that into global power so some corporations could play God.
[02:21:16.086 --> 02:21:18.727]  But these corporations don't even have a vision or a spirit.
[02:21:19.087 --> 02:21:22.929]  It's just a bunch of empty guys up there claiming they're free market when they're not free market.
[02:21:23.169 --> 02:21:24.950]  They're about to see real free market.
[02:21:25.170 --> 02:21:29.412]  They're about to see the Republic get up off of its knees and it's happening now.
[02:21:29.712 --> 02:21:31.533]  America was reborn today.
[02:21:31.553 --> 02:21:37.916]  The spirituality of the speech, it was a very spiritual speech unlike a lot of the rally speeches.
[02:21:38.256 --> 02:21:38.876]  And I tweeted
[02:21:39.634 --> 02:21:42.955]  Right before, I said, he's going to invoke the providence.
[02:21:42.975 --> 02:21:44.035]  He's going to invoke the covenant.
[02:21:44.476 --> 02:21:44.936]  And he did it.
[02:21:45.396 --> 02:21:46.196]  Because that's the key.
[02:21:46.236 --> 02:21:49.677]  Listen, I didn't even be that much of a religious person until I got deeper in and studied these people.
[02:21:50.017 --> 02:21:54.979]  They all understand that they have to get God out, not let us feel empowered, not let us know about America's destiny.
[02:21:55.678 --> 02:21:56.959]  Not teach what George Washington said.
[02:21:56.979 --> 02:22:04.662]  They need to kill that narrative because from their atheist or globalist view, from psychological view, it gives us a culture that unifies us.
[02:22:04.882 --> 02:22:14.505]  So they've been killing our culture and then they've been bringing in this alien culture of everybody hating each other and fighting with each other and trying to bring us down, but then while they suck and sap our energy.
[02:22:14.786 --> 02:22:18.307]  So the second phase of slavery just fell today.
[02:22:18.747 --> 02:22:20.308]  Humans are trying to progress through the future.
[02:22:20.328 --> 02:22:21.748]  That's why they call themselves the progressives.
[02:22:22.048 --> 02:22:22.669]  They're the opposite.
[02:22:22.689 --> 02:22:23.549]  They're not the progressives.
[02:22:24.207 --> 02:22:24.627]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:22:24.647 --> 02:22:25.427]  They're regressives.
[02:22:25.628 --> 02:22:27.148]  That's what the Jacobin Party was about.
[02:22:27.588 --> 02:22:32.170]  And that's what the Democrats were called, was the Jacobin or French Revolution Party.
[02:22:32.450 --> 02:22:36.231]  They wanted to regress everything and basically set up their own new tyranny.
[02:22:36.531 --> 02:22:40.132]  What you're seeing here is the real Renaissance and what you're seeing here is the real 1776.
[02:22:40.412 --> 02:22:42.573]  The last thing, sir.
[02:22:43.033 --> 02:22:51.476]  The subtext of Senator Schumer's speech about going into battle, was that a call to arms to the left to keep fighting?
[02:22:52.210 --> 02:22:56.413]  Yes, he was trying to get everybody to boo him so he could say, oh, I came and I was nice and they were mean to me.
[02:22:56.454 --> 02:22:57.614]  But everybody slept through it.
[02:22:57.634 --> 02:22:58.455]  Yeah, everybody slept through it.
[02:22:58.475 --> 02:22:59.736]  He was clearly putting the knife in, sorry.
[02:22:59.856 --> 02:23:01.057]  I'm like, you know, trying to twist it.
[02:23:01.478 --> 02:23:02.899]  People didn't really take the bait.
[02:23:02.919 --> 02:23:06.021]  I caught myself trying to take the bait and I went, no, no, he's trying to set us up.
[02:23:06.722 --> 02:23:09.304]  And then it just failed.
[02:23:09.364 --> 02:23:12.887]  It was just trying to bring back all this open old wounds and... Like in a mess?
[02:23:13.187 --> 02:23:13.367]  Yep.
[02:23:13.547 --> 02:23:13.968]  Big mess.
[02:23:14.308 --> 02:23:14.548]  Yeah.
[02:23:14.728 --> 02:23:21.534]  Donald Trump had a grand slam today and Chuckie Schumer or Chuckie Scammer, I mean, it just, it was a total foul ball.
[02:23:21.974 --> 02:23:22.354]  He failed.
[02:23:22.595 --> 02:23:23.275]  Thank you very much, sir.
[02:23:23.335 --> 02:23:23.715]  All right.
[02:23:23.735 --> 02:23:24.376]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:26.097 --> 02:23:26.617]  Still on here.
[02:23:26.957 --> 02:23:27.278]  All right.
[02:23:27.558 --> 02:23:27.958]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:28.919 --> 02:23:29.359]  God bless you.
[02:23:29.379 --> 02:23:30.600]  Anybody else want to get on to the radio?
[02:23:31.561 --> 02:23:31.841]  Here, sir.
[02:23:31.861 --> 02:23:32.321]  Come on in here.
[02:23:32.661 --> 02:23:33.242]  Sharp-breasted fella.
[02:23:33.262 --> 02:23:33.602]  All right.
[02:23:33.882 --> 02:23:34.463]  What's your name, sir?
[02:23:34.503 --> 02:23:35.323]  Marshall McGill.
[02:23:35.523 --> 02:23:35.944]  Marshall McGill.
[02:23:35.964 --> 02:23:36.604]  We'll talk to both of you.
[02:23:36.624 --> 02:23:36.924]  Take over.
[02:23:37.365 --> 02:23:37.705]  Hey, hey.
[02:23:37.865 --> 02:23:38.285]  You know what?
[02:23:38.465 --> 02:23:40.287]  Today was the beginning of something new.
[02:23:40.567 --> 02:23:42.228]  We've been waiting for this for a long time.
[02:23:42.828 --> 02:23:49.433]  And, you know, the most important thing I saw today was that our president is putting back America first.
[02:23:50.013 --> 02:23:51.314]  We've been compromising.
[02:23:51.514 --> 02:23:53.055]  We've been putting everybody else second.
[02:23:53.075 --> 02:23:54.556]  We didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.
[02:23:54.616 --> 02:23:55.636]  We were politically correct.
[02:23:55.977 --> 02:24:01.220]  And today, our president says, America has nothing wrong with any other country putting themselves first.
[02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:03.081]  But we're going to put ourselves first.
[02:24:03.281 --> 02:24:05.362]  And we're going to focus on building our inner cities.
[02:24:05.402 --> 02:24:07.643]  We're going to focus on building our rural areas out west.
[02:24:07.963 --> 02:24:09.945]  We're going to be focusing on education.
[02:24:10.325 --> 02:24:13.987]  And most of all, what I got today was that our president says, we're going to put God first.
[02:24:14.827 --> 02:24:20.969]  And the Bible says in Proverbs 14 and 30 that righteousness exalts the nation and sin brings it down.
[02:24:23.170 --> 02:24:25.351]  We can't do anything without God.
[02:24:25.431 --> 02:24:28.632]  And when we put God first, nothing will be impossible for us.
[02:24:28.652 --> 02:24:34.853]  So the most important thing it is today, out of all the different agendas and so forth, was putting God first.
[02:24:35.094 --> 02:24:37.974]  And if we seek God first, everything else will be added to us.
[02:24:37.994 --> 02:24:39.515]  So I'm encouraged today
[02:24:40.355 --> 02:24:41.096]  We're starting over.
[02:24:41.116 --> 02:24:46.259]  I'm encouraged today that we're putting God first, and I believe this nation is going to see a quick turnaround.
[02:24:46.519 --> 02:24:52.723]  I'm not talking about years and years, but we're going to see the first year seems like he's been in office 10 years because God's hand is going to be on it.
[02:24:52.923 --> 02:24:53.923]  You watch what God says.
[02:24:55.279 --> 02:24:56.799]  Listen, it's not mumbo-jumbo.
[02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:01.061]  They were very serious about this speech, but I could feel it when I was going in there.
[02:25:01.101 --> 02:25:06.702]  I said, I feel like Providence, and he's going to invoke God and bring God back in and ask us to accept God in.
[02:25:06.962 --> 02:25:09.883]  And that will just like fill the vacuum and push all this evil out.
[02:25:10.183 --> 02:25:11.964]  I mean, you take God out, evil pours in.
[02:25:12.184 --> 02:25:13.164]  You can feel it.
[02:25:13.404 --> 02:25:14.284]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:25:14.584 --> 02:25:15.005]  Absolutely.
[02:25:15.065 --> 02:25:17.205]  It's about who you pursue.
[02:25:17.625 --> 02:25:21.907]  And wherever you pursue and wherever your aims are, that's where your energy and the power is going to come from.
[02:25:22.187 --> 02:25:23.267]  And we put God first.
[02:25:23.607 --> 02:25:24.348]  We're good to go.
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:49.824]  And I really believe that today, America has woken up.
[02:25:49.864 --> 02:25:58.532]  And you know what, regardless of what your political party is, or what you believe, personally, morally, or whatever, but the fact is that we have to embrace democracy.
[02:25:58.893 --> 02:26:02.977]  America spoke, America won, and America has its country back.
[02:26:03.778 --> 02:26:07.141]  Absolutely, and I want to warn the elite, even if they kill Trump,
[02:26:07.850 --> 02:26:09.771]  The spirit is us, as we kept saying.
[02:26:09.971 --> 02:26:11.351]  It's already been opened up.
[02:26:11.391 --> 02:26:12.512]  It's already rising.
[02:26:12.972 --> 02:26:14.112]  And they're not going to stop it.
[02:26:14.192 --> 02:26:16.853]  All the world countries are trying to get off under the globalists.
[02:26:17.053 --> 02:26:18.253]  The globalists are very, very evil.
[02:26:18.433 --> 02:26:21.134]  And they're trying to set up their world government that the Bible tells us about.
[02:26:21.334 --> 02:26:22.315]  These are evil people.
[02:26:22.915 --> 02:26:24.255]  Yeah, we're living in the last days.
[02:26:24.335 --> 02:26:26.316]  We're living in perilous times.
[02:26:27.356 --> 02:26:31.678]  And the Bible says that the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violence is taken by force.
[02:26:31.978 --> 02:26:33.879]  We can no longer be passive.
[02:26:34.399 --> 02:26:38.441]  We can no longer sit back and watch our country go to hell.
[02:26:38.701 --> 02:26:39.582]  We can't do that.
[02:26:39.642 --> 02:26:45.144]  We've got to stand up for what is right, and we've got to take our positions as men and women of God.
[02:26:45.604 --> 02:26:50.807]  Not just for us, but we're going to be judged by what happens to the generations behind us.
[02:26:51.027 --> 02:26:54.068]  So it's imperative that we take a stand for what is right.
[02:26:54.528 --> 02:26:55.689]  And we're going to have differences.
[02:26:55.769 --> 02:26:57.030]  We're going to have disagreements.
[02:26:57.310 --> 02:26:59.391]  We're not going to always go together on everything.
[02:26:59.591 --> 02:27:11.016]  But the most important thing that we can do is agree to disagree, and then in peace, seek the higher position of that particular principle or whatever we're debating on.
[02:27:11.216 --> 02:27:14.558]  But I believe, I honestly with all my heart, that today
[02:27:15.158 --> 02:27:17.260]  America has taken the step, and you know what?
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:23.105]  It's not just America, but there are countries all around the world that have been waiting on us to do this.
[02:27:23.305 --> 02:27:31.893]  The Bible says in Romans 8, it says that the creation, they moan and groan, waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God, but it does not appear what they should be.
[02:27:32.133 --> 02:27:38.138]  There are people out there waiting for America to take its stand again, and they will support us.
[02:27:38.399 --> 02:27:40.821]  But this divisiveness, this blackness, white,
[02:27:41.121 --> 02:27:43.342]  There's all this stuff that's going on.
[02:27:43.382 --> 02:27:44.323]  It's just political.
[02:27:44.563 --> 02:27:47.145]  It's just the enemy because we don't wrestle against flesh and blood.
[02:27:47.445 --> 02:27:49.986]  But I believe that today we're on the right track, buddy.
[02:27:50.026 --> 02:27:50.927]  We're on the right track.
[02:27:51.127 --> 02:27:53.488]  Have you ever felt the spirit stronger than today?
[02:27:53.548 --> 02:27:53.929]  No, no.
[02:27:54.009 --> 02:27:55.970]  You know, and I watched the rabbi speak.
[02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:59.192]  I watched Paul White speak.
[02:27:59.252 --> 02:28:00.813]  I watched the African American.
[02:28:00.953 --> 02:28:05.275]  And I saw, and I saw that and I heard what President Trump said in his speech.
[02:28:05.836 --> 02:28:08.137]  I'm telling you right now, we put God first.
[02:28:08.317 --> 02:28:09.678]  That's never ever.
[02:28:10.906 --> 02:28:11.727]  That I can remember.
[02:28:11.747 --> 02:28:13.750]  Did you see how the Democrats were squirming up there?
[02:28:13.810 --> 02:28:14.932]  Look, you're gonna squirm.
[02:28:14.972 --> 02:28:17.154]  When truth is coming forth, you're gonna squirm.
[02:28:17.295 --> 02:28:18.216]  Let me say something to you.
[02:28:18.877 --> 02:28:27.759]  This has probably been one of the few times I've heard the name Jesus Christ mentioned in inauguration as much as it was mentioned today.
[02:28:28.139 --> 02:28:43.483]  And not mentioned out of fear or intimidation, but with confidence and boldness, it was mentioned because people realize that the only way this America that we serve, that we love, is going to be back on top again like it's supposed to be and be great again, is that we put God first.
[02:28:43.923 --> 02:28:47.184]  Well, even foreign leaders throughout history have marveled at the, quote, luck of America or Providence.
[02:28:47.524 --> 02:28:48.284]  Bismarck said,
[02:28:49.659 --> 02:28:52.822]  God loves children, drunks, and the United States of America.
[02:28:53.623 --> 02:28:54.604]  So, well, God bless you.
[02:28:54.624 --> 02:28:55.164]  Anything else, sir?
[02:28:55.325 --> 02:28:55.845]  No, that's it.
[02:28:55.865 --> 02:28:56.466]  God bless you.
[02:28:56.506 --> 02:28:57.226]  Thank you for what you do.
[02:28:57.266 --> 02:28:58.968]  Can I tell you something, sir?
[02:28:58.988 --> 02:28:59.188]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:59.248 --> 02:28:59.749]  Anybody else?
[02:29:00.069 --> 02:29:00.650]  Yes, great.
[02:29:01.691 --> 02:29:02.231]  Thank you.
[02:29:02.271 --> 02:29:03.593]  We're on the march.
[02:29:03.633 --> 02:29:05.214]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:06.135 --> 02:29:08.798]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:13.559 --> 02:29:15.080]  Migrants are racing for the U.S.
[02:29:15.140 --> 02:29:17.381]  border right before Trump is taking office.
[02:29:17.421 --> 02:29:22.224]  There's an article that's up on the Drudge Report that talks about how illegals are coming for the U.S.
[02:29:22.304 --> 02:29:24.425]  border in lieu of a Trump victory.
[02:29:24.485 --> 02:29:26.146]  He's taking office tomorrow, folks.
[02:29:26.366 --> 02:29:28.107]  Migrants that are trying to sneak into the U.S.
[02:29:28.287 --> 02:29:32.609]  on the last day of what they see because they realize that a wall is in fact coming.
[02:29:33.029 --> 02:29:36.711]  These challenges are nothing compared to a bigger fear they have that someday soon U.S.
[02:29:36.771 --> 02:29:39.693]  President-elect Donald Trump will build that wall and keep them out.
[02:29:40.013 --> 02:29:47.418]  So, before Trump takes office tomorrow, they're racing against time, riding a freight train up to the border to look for a way across.
[02:29:47.618 --> 02:29:53.402]  In the town, near a frontier, a group of Hondurans warn themselves near a fire of trash in the early morning cold.
[02:29:53.642 --> 02:30:00.087]  There's an article that YouTube has put up showing these migrants ready to jump the train in the event that it slows down.
[02:30:00.387 --> 02:30:07.692]  And I've got news for you folks, that wall is coming, but it looks like migrants are feeling the burn, literally, and racing for the border.
[02:30:07.952 --> 02:30:09.533]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.
[02:30:09.794 --> 02:30:10.555]  We're good to go.
[02:30:13.078 --> 02:30:21.223]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[02:30:22.183 --> 02:30:31.008]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[02:30:31.409 --> 02:30:38.333]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme, and they've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[02:30:38.353 --> 02:30:39.854]  We now have George Soros
[02:30:40.954 --> 02:30:48.158]  As a goblin, on the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[02:30:48.899 --> 02:30:54.061]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[02:30:55.522 --> 02:31:02.606]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[02:31:02.966 --> 02:31:03.527]  It's powerful.
[02:31:03.547 --> 02:31:04.587]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.
[02:31:04.867 --> 02:31:06.608]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:13.027 --> 02:31:19.193]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:31:19.573 --> 02:31:22.456]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:31:22.816 --> 02:31:28.001]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:31:28.421 --> 02:31:34.406]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:31:34.547 --> 02:31:37.669]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:39.271]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[02:31:39.471 --> 02:31:43.615]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:31:43.795 --> 02:31:46.678]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:31:46.738 --> 02:31:48.319]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:31:48.419 --> 02:31:51.582]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:31:51.882 --> 02:31:54.205]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:31:54.485 --> 02:31:55.446]  It's in powder form.
[02:31:55.546 --> 02:31:58.248]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:31:58.428 --> 02:31:59.449]  I take this.
[02:31:59.549 --> 02:32:00.831]  This is the product that I take.
[02:32:00.951 --> 02:32:02.912]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:32:03.733 --> 02:32:04.513]  We fight the globalists.
[02:32:04.533 --> 02:32:05.373]  We fight the New World Order.
[02:32:05.674 --> 02:32:10.975]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:11.015 --> 02:32:16.996]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[02:32:17.376 --> 02:32:21.217]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[02:32:21.977 --> 02:32:25.058]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[02:32:26.471 --> 02:32:31.714]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[02:32:32.034 --> 02:32:35.796]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls, and in our minds.
[02:32:36.277 --> 02:32:37.898]  We have to be good.
[02:32:38.578 --> 02:32:39.399]  We have to be pure.
[02:32:39.419 --> 02:32:40.259]  We have to be strong.
[02:32:40.599 --> 02:32:42.020]  We have to build prosperity.
[02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:51.886]  We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believed we were going to fail, who believed their divide and conquer would work.
[02:32:52.726 --> 02:32:55.208]  Yes, we've won the first phase.
[02:32:56.249 --> 02:33:00.338]  The battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[02:33:00.819 --> 02:33:07.372]  But, Obama, and Hillary, and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[02:33:25.740 --> 02:33:30.167]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.008 --> 02:33:31.910]  Move bitch!
[02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:33.072]  Get out the way!
[02:33:35.095 --> 02:33:41.139]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[02:33:41.259 --> 02:33:45.581]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[02:33:45.601 --> 02:33:49.043]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[02:33:49.063 --> 02:33:50.604]  I will not let you down.
[02:33:50.664 --> 02:33:53.586]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:33:53.786 --> 02:33:55.167]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[02:33:56.608 --> 02:33:58.049]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[02:33:58.089 --> 02:34:03.133]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[02:34:03.173 --> 02:34:05.215]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:34:05.695 --> 02:34:06.856]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:34:09.361 --> 02:34:10.902]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:34:10.942 --> 02:34:13.164]  David Knight and the rest of the great crew are there in studio.
[02:34:13.184 --> 02:34:18.148]  I'm going to talk to a few more people out here on the street, and then I'm going to go get a little bite to eat, and then I'm going to be back on.
[02:34:18.488 --> 02:34:23.212]  I really need to focus, write some notes, and just be very humble, because this is a very special time.
[02:34:24.373 --> 02:34:27.495]  The evil that was getting ready to unfold, you thought things were already evil?
[02:34:27.976 --> 02:34:29.717]  They were about to launch the full evil.
[02:34:30.518 --> 02:34:34.681]  Total takeover of the media, arresting patriots, torturing us, I mean the whole nine yards.
[02:34:35.490 --> 02:34:40.254]  And it was so horrible that even the intelligence agencies just said, we just can't do this.
[02:34:40.274 --> 02:34:40.835]  This is crazy.
[02:34:40.855 --> 02:34:42.236]  It's like a comic book of evil.
[02:34:42.296 --> 02:34:43.437]  I mean, it's just so evil.
[02:34:44.318 --> 02:34:50.423]  You see movies, you read history books, both fiction and non-fiction, you think things like this can't really be happening, till you see it happen.
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:54.583]  I mean, we saw a guy trying to get three llamas in this morning, past Homeland Security.
[02:34:54.903 --> 02:34:57.045]  And it's like, we had to take photos out there and no one would believe it.
[02:34:57.305 --> 02:34:58.186]  I'm going to put those up later.
[02:34:58.206 --> 02:35:00.508]  It's like a bomb in the llama or something.
[02:35:00.788 --> 02:35:02.109]  I mean, it's just so much.
[02:35:02.589 --> 02:35:04.331]  My point is, crazy stuff's going on.
[02:35:04.371 --> 02:35:05.912]  Roger Stone shows up in a huge top hat.
[02:35:06.372 --> 02:35:07.593]  He's been poisoned by polonium.
[02:35:08.594 --> 02:35:10.156]  We're living in crazy times.
[02:35:10.756 --> 02:35:12.517]  To the left, the right, all points of the compass.
[02:35:12.577 --> 02:35:13.078]  It is wild.
[02:35:13.338 --> 02:35:15.440]  Sir, tell us who you are and tell us what you think about this today.
[02:35:16.693 --> 02:35:18.294]  Nice to be here and nice to see you.
[02:35:18.314 --> 02:35:19.495]  My name is Philip Thomas.
[02:35:19.555 --> 02:35:21.317]  I'm a naturalized American citizen.
[02:35:21.657 --> 02:35:23.258]  I lived in many parts of the world.
[02:35:23.318 --> 02:35:24.399]  I lived in Muslim countries.
[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:29.844]  And I know how human rights are being violated.
[02:35:29.864 --> 02:35:32.607]  And people of other religions are treated like dirt.
[02:35:33.367 --> 02:35:34.568]  And this country is a great country.
[02:35:34.608 --> 02:35:37.311]  For the past eight years, we had a nightmare with Obama.
[02:35:38.251 --> 02:35:39.893]  And that nightmare is over today!
[02:35:39.913 --> 02:35:41.955]  Yeah!
[02:35:44.116 --> 02:35:49.261]  Yeah, as the other brother, the African-American brother said, a lot of quotation he gave from the Bible.
[02:35:49.622 --> 02:35:55.147]  You read Daniel Chapter 2, you will find God is the installer and God is the remover of kings.
[02:35:55.467 --> 02:36:00.152]  Today, God had installed Mr. Trump as the president of this country.
[02:36:00.332 --> 02:36:00.713]  That's right.
[02:36:00.853 --> 02:36:03.195]  We voted, but nothing the enemy could do worked.
[02:36:03.275 --> 02:36:04.036]  It all turned against us.
[02:36:04.096 --> 02:36:04.737]  It was providence.
[02:36:05.317 --> 02:36:07.079]  I can't tell you the providence I've experienced.
[02:36:07.492 --> 02:36:13.154]  You know, my heart bleeds when I see the young people supporting Democratic Party, which is directionless.
[02:36:13.755 --> 02:36:16.016]  And now, you know what's happening with Democratic Party?
[02:36:16.056 --> 02:36:20.898]  They're trying to take Keith Ellison as the chief, and he is an Islamist!
[02:36:21.538 --> 02:36:23.419]  He wants to destroy United States!
[02:36:24.859 --> 02:36:25.940]  And Americans should wake up!
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:30.702]  If you don't wake up, you'll be in your slumber, and your slumber will lead to death!
[02:36:32.702 --> 02:36:37.425]  The war... Muslims have divided the world into two parts, Dar al-Harb and Dar al-Islam.
[02:36:37.766 --> 02:36:41.488]  Where Islamic rule is there, it is known as Dar al-Islam, which means House of Islam.
[02:36:41.728 --> 02:36:45.411]  And where there is no Islamic rule, it is known as Dar al-Harb, which means House of War.
[02:36:45.851 --> 02:36:51.515]  And the House of Islam should wage constantly war against the House of
[02:36:52.512 --> 02:36:56.593]  We have to be careful and Alex Jones is doing a great job!
[02:37:13.977 --> 02:37:23.803]  I've been watching his videos on YouTube and my son who lives in India always calls and tells me, don't forget, don't, don't, don't neglect Alex Jones views.
[02:37:24.624 --> 02:37:26.845]  It's very important and it will save America.
[02:37:27.245 --> 02:37:27.966]  And I'm so glad.
[02:37:27.986 --> 02:37:29.527]  I'm glad to learn there's huge listeners in India.
[02:37:29.567 --> 02:37:30.587]  Yeah, of course you have.
[02:37:31.048 --> 02:37:34.810]  And the day after tomorrow, I'm flying to India and I'm going to be an ambassador for Mr. Trump.
[02:37:34.830 --> 02:37:35.030]  Great.
[02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:36.051]  But enough about me.
[02:37:36.071 --> 02:37:37.832]  Talk about where you see the country going.
[02:37:38.252 --> 02:37:38.532]  Pardon?
[02:37:38.812 --> 02:37:39.312]  Talk about me.
[02:37:39.332 --> 02:37:41.033]  I mean, talk about what you're reading.
[02:37:41.053 --> 02:37:41.633]  Oh, sorry.
[02:37:41.833 --> 02:37:42.133]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:42.173 --> 02:37:44.353]  So, we have to be very careful about the Islamic agenda.
[02:37:44.833 --> 02:37:46.293]  You know, they say Muslims are all good.
[02:37:46.433 --> 02:37:47.654]  Oh, let them be good at home.
[02:37:48.534 --> 02:37:48.834]  Okay?
[02:37:49.134 --> 02:37:51.374]  But they want to destroy the United States.
[02:37:51.474 --> 02:37:54.555]  Outside the United States, they said America is a devil.
[02:37:54.735 --> 02:37:56.155]  But here, they say, God bless America.
[02:37:56.175 --> 02:37:56.815]  It's taqiyya.
[02:37:57.135 --> 02:37:59.476]  There's an Arabic, a Muslim doctrine called taqiyya.
[02:37:59.536 --> 02:38:02.576]  Lie before your enemy, but hate them in your heart.
[02:38:03.196 --> 02:38:03.956]  That's what's happening.
[02:38:03.976 --> 02:38:07.417]  So, America should wake up and give an answer.
[02:38:08.993 --> 02:38:10.335]  I think America's starting to wake up.
[02:38:10.375 --> 02:38:10.615]  Yes.
[02:38:11.576 --> 02:38:15.541]  If they kill Trump, which I know they're seriously considering doing, I think it'll be an even bigger defeat for them.
[02:38:15.681 --> 02:38:15.801]  No, no.
[02:38:15.841 --> 02:38:20.286]  I don't think that will happen because our police, our military, our Secret Service, they're all strong.
[02:38:20.487 --> 02:38:21.047]  They're the best.
[02:38:21.067 --> 02:38:22.549]  I agree, but they're going to try is what I'm saying.
[02:38:22.649 --> 02:38:23.510]  Oh yeah, of course, yes.
[02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:26.133]  Yes, of course, they'll try, but they'll try being vain.
[02:38:27.014 --> 02:38:28.196]  But Trump will triumph!
[02:38:30.450 --> 02:38:31.250]  Jesus will protect!
[02:38:31.310 --> 02:38:32.091]  Jesus will protect!
[02:38:32.111 --> 02:38:32.351]  Yes!
[02:38:32.791 --> 02:38:42.756]  Because God is the installer and Yahweh has installed Mr. Trump to become the president of the greatest nation and the most, the greatest superpower ever in the history of mankind.
[02:38:42.776 --> 02:38:51.701]  So I'm so glad to be here and if you want some more, some more, some more, some of my views, I can tell you what, you know, America should become strong.
[02:38:51.961 --> 02:38:55.302]  A strong America is the one which will stop Islamization of this world.
[02:38:55.322 --> 02:38:56.263]  Well, let's talk about this.
[02:38:56.803 --> 02:38:58.104]  I mean, look at how
[02:38:59.176 --> 02:39:01.716]  Look at how the globalists are so upset right now.
[02:39:01.796 --> 02:39:02.957]  They can tell the tide's turning.
[02:39:03.217 --> 02:39:04.217]  Q, I gotta get your view.
[02:39:04.257 --> 02:39:04.997]  You saw the thing.
[02:39:05.017 --> 02:39:05.317]  Get over here.
[02:39:05.617 --> 02:39:06.237]  No, you're getting on air.
[02:39:06.797 --> 02:39:08.398]  I'm sorry, you're doing it.
[02:39:08.678 --> 02:39:09.178]  Thank you, sir.
[02:39:09.218 --> 02:39:09.678]  Thank you very much.
[02:39:09.698 --> 02:39:11.378]  Here, we'll interview the back of his head.
[02:39:11.398 --> 02:39:12.418]  What do you think about the situation?
[02:39:13.058 --> 02:39:13.959]  Hey, Zimmerman, you get in there.
[02:39:13.999 --> 02:39:14.679]  I didn't know Zimmerman was here.
[02:39:15.039 --> 02:39:15.759]  Go ahead, Zimmerman.
[02:39:15.779 --> 02:39:16.439]  Tell us what you think.
[02:39:16.699 --> 02:39:19.339]  This entire inauguration has been extremely historic, obviously.
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:22.400]  And just seeing the energy... Nothing historic!
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:23.200]  Completely.
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:25.881]  Seeing the energy... A seismic pole shift.
[02:39:26.261 --> 02:39:28.421]  A supernova of enlightenment.
[02:39:29.159 --> 02:39:31.180]  A title release of the Titans of Liberty!
[02:39:31.461 --> 02:39:31.781]  Yeah!
[02:39:32.021 --> 02:39:32.541]  Yeah!
[02:39:32.561 --> 02:39:34.463]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:39:35.684 --> 02:39:42.088]  The look people had going in this morning was obviously already high energy, but just leaving today, seeing all the people leaving, they're re-energized.
[02:39:42.108 --> 02:39:45.190]  They're rejuvenated and ready to make America great again.
[02:39:45.911 --> 02:39:49.713]  Absolutely, and again, it's not that the Republican establishment's out to get Trump.
[02:39:49.793 --> 02:39:51.835]  I hate the Republican establishment, but so are the Democrats.
[02:39:51.895 --> 02:39:54.356]  It's so obvious that he's anti-new world order and awesome.
[02:39:54.617 --> 02:39:55.257]  You're awesome.
[02:39:55.777 --> 02:39:56.438]  Come on here on air!
[02:39:57.722 --> 02:39:58.783]  I made it here!
[02:39:58.863 --> 02:39:59.383]  Well, you're awesome.
[02:39:59.443 --> 02:40:01.005]  Oh my God, I love you!
[02:40:01.025 --> 02:40:01.385]  You're awesome.
[02:40:01.565 --> 02:40:01.985]  You're awesome.
[02:40:02.045 --> 02:40:03.066]  Here, talk to folks out there.
[02:40:03.086 --> 02:40:03.507]  Come on, Steph.
[02:40:03.527 --> 02:40:04.307]  Here, talk to folks out there.
[02:40:04.407 --> 02:40:06.149]  I have my InfoWars right now here.
[02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:07.630]  Oh, you have your InfoWars live.
[02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:08.390]  Thank you.
[02:40:08.430 --> 02:40:09.291]  Oh my God!
[02:40:09.311 --> 02:40:10.692]  Somebody take a picture of me, please.
[02:40:10.732 --> 02:40:12.253]  What do you think about the whole inauguration?
[02:40:12.834 --> 02:40:18.638]  I'm like so... I am like... My heart is so happy.
[02:40:18.759 --> 02:40:20.760]  I just... I just love this.
[02:40:21.401 --> 02:40:22.521]  I love Mr. Trump.
[02:40:22.782 --> 02:40:24.443]  I met him in 2013, and he is such a good person.
[02:40:27.407 --> 02:40:32.770]  And when I found out he was running, I had to run down and fly down to Miami.
[02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:35.511]  And he has such a good heart.
[02:40:35.731 --> 02:40:36.792]  He is not a racist.
[02:40:36.912 --> 02:40:38.132]  He loves this country.
[02:40:38.432 --> 02:40:43.975]  And he just wants to unite us, just like he said in the speech, we all bleed red.
[02:40:44.555 --> 02:40:49.538]  Every one of us, white, red, white, you know, black, Hispanic.
[02:40:50.507 --> 02:40:59.736]  Um, Japanese, whoever you are, we are all red, and we are patriots, and I love Alex Jones because he's the only one I listen to.
[02:41:00.537 --> 02:41:01.418]  Well, thanks for coming.
[02:41:01.438 --> 02:41:01.978]  It was awesome.
[02:41:02.238 --> 02:41:02.999]  History happened.
[02:41:03.019 --> 02:41:04.841]  I was gonna bring my son, but it's just too dangerous.
[02:41:05.321 --> 02:41:06.402]  They were attacking women.
[02:41:06.903 --> 02:41:08.324]  I mean, all the women were coming by bleeding.
[02:41:08.364 --> 02:41:09.025]  I go, what's going on?
[02:41:09.065 --> 02:41:09.805]  Women on crutches.
[02:41:10.206 --> 02:41:12.888]  Old ladies are like, they're beating us up trying to get in.
[02:41:13.149 --> 02:41:14.069]  The left is down there.
[02:41:14.110 --> 02:41:15.451]  And I went down there and they attacked us.
[02:41:16.292 --> 02:41:18.053]  I mean, it's just like, what the hell?
[02:41:18.393 --> 02:41:19.554]  And they really go, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi!
[02:41:19.634 --> 02:41:21.455]  And I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?
[02:41:21.475 --> 02:41:22.836]  They're like, Putin's a Nazi!
[02:41:22.896 --> 02:41:25.197]  I'm like, it's the Russians who beat the Nazis, dumbass!
[02:41:25.637 --> 02:41:26.818]  They just don't know anything!
[02:41:27.438 --> 02:41:30.060]  They just have no historical... They just believe MSNBC.
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:38.645]  I'll tell ya, only a few thousand of the protesters, millions of people away, and your BS is coming to an end, so... Yeah!
[02:41:38.985 --> 02:41:39.565]  Yeah!
[02:41:42.558 --> 02:41:43.098]  1776 worldwide!
[02:41:43.198 --> 02:41:44.359]  All right, listen, guys.
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:47.321]  David Knight, you guys can pop in whenever you want here.
[02:41:47.341 --> 02:41:48.242]  David, what do you think of all this?
[02:41:48.502 --> 02:41:49.603]  Leanne, everybody.
[02:41:50.223 --> 02:41:58.769]  Well, you know, Alex, listening to the preachers that have been there and the other crowd that have been there, I think it's pretty important to go back and look at what Franklin Graham said.
[02:41:58.789 --> 02:42:04.793]  You know, he said in the Bible, as he got up and spoke, he said, the Bible rain is a sign of God's blessing, and it started to rain when you came to the platform.
[02:42:05.373 --> 02:42:10.795]  I think it's real important to look at the massive difference between Donald Trump and Barack Obama.
[02:42:11.296 --> 02:42:21.700]  It was Barack Obama who denigrated people, who looked to God, said these bitter clingers with their Bibles and their guns, well you know what, maybe we're better
[02:42:22.140 --> 02:42:25.101]  Not that we're better people, but we're clinging to better things.
[02:42:25.221 --> 02:42:25.501]  Right.
[02:42:25.681 --> 02:42:25.961]  Okay?
[02:42:26.081 --> 02:42:37.224]  And what we're seeing here from Donald Trump is someone who is going to honor God, as that pastor said, put God first, look for his blessing.
[02:42:37.444 --> 02:42:50.288]  And I think another key thing that we need to look at here, as Donald Trump talked about God, deferred to God as our protector, he also referred to himself only three times in two different sentences, as The Daily Caller points out, and yet we saw just last night,
[02:42:51.008 --> 02:42:55.449]  Barack Obama, in his final speech to the press, referred to himself 45 times.
[02:42:55.529 --> 02:42:59.890]  He even talked about himself as being, uh, no-drama Obama.
[02:42:59.910 --> 02:43:02.350]  So that's the, you know, that's the difference.
[02:43:02.370 --> 02:43:04.011]  75 times in his farewell address.
[02:43:04.031 --> 02:43:07.551]  118 times when he was out stumping for Hillary Clinton.
[02:43:07.571 --> 02:43:11.952]  People actually thought he was going to be running for president again because he was talking about himself so much.
[02:43:12.232 --> 02:43:17.093]  How refreshing to see Donald Trump say, this is giving the power back to you, the people.
[02:43:17.173 --> 02:43:17.834]  It's not about me.
[02:43:17.854 --> 02:43:18.314]  That's right, Leanne.
[02:43:18.334 --> 02:43:19.634]  And we're going to go back to you in just a moment.
[02:43:20.407 --> 02:43:22.430]  A few more people in here and I'm going to hand the baton to you guys.
[02:43:23.191 --> 02:43:24.153]  You ladies that want to talk, get ready.
[02:43:24.433 --> 02:43:24.834]  Go ahead, ma'am.
[02:43:25.521 --> 02:43:27.142]  Hi, my name's Dina.
[02:43:27.282 --> 02:43:28.663]  I'm here with Alex Jones.
[02:43:28.703 --> 02:43:33.405]  We're celebrating one of the most historic things to ever happen in the United States of America.
[02:43:33.685 --> 02:43:35.926]  We actually got the power back to the people.
[02:43:36.046 --> 02:43:37.807]  Donald Trump gave us that power today.
[02:43:38.788 --> 02:43:39.728]  And God blessed us.
[02:43:39.768 --> 02:43:40.789]  God bless America.
[02:43:40.909 --> 02:43:42.190]  God bless Donald Trump today.
[02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:46.572]  And I just thank God for you, Alex Jones, for helping to wake so many people up.
[02:43:46.752 --> 02:43:48.473]  You don't realize how many people you touched.
[02:43:48.713 --> 02:43:50.414]  I've been listening to you for over a decade.
[02:43:51.034 --> 02:43:51.774]  Absolutely!
[02:43:51.794 --> 02:43:52.095]  Thank you!
[02:43:52.195 --> 02:43:52.535]  Thank you!
[02:43:52.555 --> 02:43:53.295]  Great job!
[02:43:53.315 --> 02:43:53.875]  God bless you!
[02:44:06.966 --> 02:44:14.893]  What's happening here is the globalists got so delusional that all their hate and all their lies and all their disinfo didn't turn people the way they thought it turned them away from them.
[02:44:15.233 --> 02:44:18.616]  They have become insane and they can't admit they're failing on every front.
[02:44:19.157 --> 02:44:21.398]  And Trump has said he's changed the last few years.
[02:44:21.799 --> 02:44:23.000]  I have too, but so has everybody else.
[02:44:23.562 --> 02:44:24.644]  It's like the hundred monkey thing.
[02:44:24.664 --> 02:44:38.563]  If you want to not believe in spirit or sixth sense that's been proven, it's that they'll have like an island with monkeys 20 miles away, the same species, and as soon as a certain number of monkeys on one island learn something, they don't know why suddenly the other one's 20 miles away learning.
[02:44:39.065 --> 02:44:43.487]  And so there's something going on and it's like, it's the invisible human internet.
[02:44:43.827 --> 02:44:46.068]  And so right now, Trump is growing too.
[02:44:46.648 --> 02:44:49.909]  And Trump is, imagine all the stuff he's getting hit by in the discernment.
[02:44:50.189 --> 02:44:53.131]  And he's asking God for providence and to lead God and direct him.
[02:44:53.191 --> 02:44:58.873]  Imagine what he's going to be given just as George Washington grew, grew, grew with all the discernment he was given.
[02:44:59.553 --> 02:45:00.033]  Come on, ma'am.
[02:45:00.153 --> 02:45:01.234]  Come on in here, whoever wants to get in here.
[02:45:01.474 --> 02:45:03.915]  And I'm going to hand the baton over right now for the next 15 minutes.
[02:45:03.955 --> 02:45:05.416]  David Knight, you guys will be over in a minute.
[02:45:05.716 --> 02:45:06.396]  Come on in here, sir.
[02:45:07.637 --> 02:45:16.689]  I just want to say it's an amazing experience being here and finally having a previous regime end.
[02:45:18.939 --> 02:45:23.021]  I don't know, giving the truth and a new light by Alex and all the people in the new media.
[02:45:23.641 --> 02:45:28.064]  And just an unabashed plug, DNA Air Force.
[02:45:28.664 --> 02:45:29.664]  Buy a Truce Millennium.
[02:45:29.844 --> 02:45:30.725]  Please buy the products.
[02:45:30.765 --> 02:45:31.565]  They're fantastic.
[02:45:31.765 --> 02:45:33.066]  And, you know, I know you don't plug enough.
[02:45:33.246 --> 02:45:35.427]  And so just buy and support the freedom.
[02:45:35.827 --> 02:45:38.569]  We're crushing the old stream media and it's a new dawn.
[02:45:38.589 --> 02:45:39.189]  It's a new era.
[02:45:39.669 --> 02:45:40.370]  It's exciting.
[02:45:40.450 --> 02:45:42.151]  I can't believe it's over.
[02:45:42.171 --> 02:45:43.431]  I like that, the old stream media.
[02:45:43.451 --> 02:45:44.051]  It's the era of Trump.
[02:45:44.071 --> 02:45:44.872]  It's the era of the people.
[02:45:44.932 --> 02:45:47.113]  It's the era of a new America.
[02:45:48.041 --> 02:45:48.661]  Beautiful, brother.
[02:45:48.961 --> 02:45:49.362]  Beautiful.
[02:45:49.422 --> 02:45:49.982]  All right, guys.
[02:45:50.082 --> 02:45:51.783]  Anybody else want to hand the baton back to our crew?
[02:45:51.803 --> 02:45:52.863]  All right, run on in here.
[02:45:52.883 --> 02:45:55.564]  Come on in.
[02:45:56.384 --> 02:45:57.405]  I'm a college student.
[02:45:57.445 --> 02:46:04.227]  I just want to say it's been incredible to watch how much the political landscape has changed in the last couple of months.
[02:46:04.307 --> 02:46:15.932]  Just being able to express yourself has been something that we've been unable to do because as soon as you say something, you're labeled, you're attacked, and it's a way of controlling.
[02:46:16.644 --> 02:46:17.165]  Our speech.
[02:46:17.665 --> 02:46:19.146]  And it's a way of controlling us.
[02:46:19.587 --> 02:46:21.868]  And it's just been amazing to see that shift change.
[02:46:21.889 --> 02:46:24.811]  And it's important that young people start to get involved.
[02:46:24.871 --> 02:46:30.536]  And we start fighting back against this political correctness that has completely destroyed academia.
[02:46:31.877 --> 02:46:33.298]  I mean, it's been another nightmare.
[02:46:33.318 --> 02:46:35.380]  It's been to destroy free thought, absolutely.
[02:46:35.891 --> 02:46:38.875]  Well, and it's important that we start fighting back, because that's all we have.
[02:46:38.955 --> 02:46:43.321]  We need to be autonomous and independent, and we need to think analytically and critically.
[02:46:43.842 --> 02:46:45.845]  And if we do that, we'll be more informed.
[02:46:45.865 --> 02:46:46.425]  Hey, I love you guys.
[02:46:46.445 --> 02:46:47.266]  I gotta roll out.
[02:46:47.287 --> 02:46:47.847]  Thank you so much.
[02:46:52.489 --> 02:46:53.609]  I want to say one thing real quick.
[02:46:53.629 --> 02:46:59.811]  Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Southeast, regional office, and I worked against the GOP to support Trump.
[02:47:00.371 --> 02:47:06.033]  There were a lot of people that were just not on board for Trump where I work, and it was all volunteer.
[02:47:06.093 --> 02:47:08.613]  We grassroots Pennsylvania, so.
[02:47:10.054 --> 02:47:10.354]  Good job.
[02:47:10.374 --> 02:47:11.214]  Anyway, PA for Trump.
[02:47:11.234 --> 02:47:11.694]  Yay.
[02:47:11.734 --> 02:47:12.274]  All right, thank you.
[02:47:12.294 --> 02:47:13.034]  Anybody else want to talk?
[02:47:13.074 --> 02:47:15.095]  Yeah, they had to work against people in their own party.
[02:47:15.896 --> 02:47:16.436]  Oh yeah.
[02:47:16.456 --> 02:47:17.077]  Well, continue.
[02:47:17.117 --> 02:47:17.677]  How's it going?
[02:47:17.717 --> 02:47:20.619]  This is Glenn Zarmanoff reporting live from Washington, D.C.
[02:47:20.659 --> 02:47:21.799]  We are Change, New Jersey.
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:23.660]  Jersey City for 9-11 Truth.
[02:47:24.041 --> 02:47:27.202]  I've been in the info war since 2001, since I found Alex Jones.
[02:47:27.703 --> 02:47:31.245]  Of course, I was already awake to 9-11 Truth before that, because I'm a 9-11 eyewitness.
[02:47:31.565 --> 02:47:39.709]  You can please check out my YouTube channel, Glenn Zarmanoff, G-L-E-N-N-Z-A-R-M-A-N-O-V, and you can find the five terabytes that came out in 2010.
[02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:43.932]  Declassified from NIST that they withheld intentionally.
[02:47:43.952 --> 02:47:51.156]  5,000 gigabytes of previously kept secret videos and photos from 9-11 that proves the whole thing is an inside job.
[02:47:51.516 --> 02:47:55.318]  Before we had speculation and conjecture, now we have 5 terabytes.
[02:47:55.378 --> 02:47:55.999]  Please check it out.
[02:47:56.019 --> 02:47:56.719]  Glenn Zarminov.
[02:47:57.259 --> 02:47:57.740]  Thanks, Glenn.
[02:47:59.076 --> 02:48:03.840]  Hey guys, I'm running low on batteries for maybe like two more people and then we'll have to end it.
[02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:05.701]  But here's another fine fellow who came up.
[02:48:05.721 --> 02:48:06.162]  Here you go, sir.
[02:48:06.442 --> 02:48:06.842]  Oh, hi.
[02:48:07.162 --> 02:48:07.823]  I'm Will Cody.
[02:48:08.183 --> 02:48:10.085]  I was just walking down there from the rally, right?
[02:48:10.105 --> 02:48:10.905]  Coming over here.
[02:48:11.326 --> 02:48:15.429]  And these like, these Antifa guys, I don't know what, they're like, they're wearing black.
[02:48:15.449 --> 02:48:16.630]  They have like bandanas on.
[02:48:16.930 --> 02:48:17.890]  You know, all black.
[02:48:18.071 --> 02:48:20.272]  They're carrying a big flag, like the hammer and sickle on it.
[02:48:20.693 --> 02:48:21.913]  And they like, they spit on me.
[02:48:21.954 --> 02:48:23.935]  Like, it's terrible.
[02:48:23.955 --> 02:48:25.076]  Like, they're all radicalized there.
[02:48:25.096 --> 02:48:26.317]  People are, it's terrible.
[02:48:26.677 --> 02:48:27.338]  They're disgusting.
[02:48:28.593 --> 02:48:28.853]  All right, man.
[02:48:28.873 --> 02:48:29.354]  Thanks a lot.
[02:48:30.054 --> 02:48:33.918]  It looks like the crowd has dissipated as soon as Alex Jones walked off.
[02:48:34.258 --> 02:48:36.780]  And so I'm going to throw it back to you guys.
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:38.081]  I'm running low on battery anyway.
[02:48:38.101 --> 02:48:41.364]  This is Rob Dew reporting from just outside the Capitals right over there.
[02:48:41.384 --> 02:48:44.887]  And that's where they swore in Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States.
[02:48:44.907 --> 02:48:45.628]  Hey, do you want to say anything?
[02:48:47.729 --> 02:48:48.630]  Info Wars.
[02:48:49.431 --> 02:48:51.953]  The Info Warriors are out in force today.
[02:48:53.094 --> 02:48:55.076]  It's great to be here.
[02:48:56.550 --> 02:49:01.892]  With like-minded people walking around, just the energy is incredible.
[02:49:01.912 --> 02:49:04.413]  Don't get nervous.
[02:49:04.453 --> 02:49:05.013]  Don't get nervous.
[02:49:06.293 --> 02:49:07.054]  I'm speechless.
[02:49:07.454 --> 02:49:08.574]  I really, I can't.
[02:49:09.214 --> 02:49:12.916]  Give me a good laugh.
[02:49:13.696 --> 02:49:15.037]  I hope I wasn't too obnoxious.
[02:49:16.617 --> 02:49:19.198]  I met this guy last night outside the Deplora Ball.
[02:49:19.918 --> 02:49:21.559]  Anyway, I'm going to swing this around.
[02:49:22.267 --> 02:49:27.393]  Well, do go get some battery power because I can't wait to hear all about what happened last night at the Deplora Ball.
[02:49:27.934 --> 02:49:30.837]  Yeah, I didn't quite make it in, but I did get some stuff outside.
[02:49:30.937 --> 02:49:31.718]  It was interesting.
[02:49:31.738 --> 02:49:33.080]  Talked to a lot of people who were victims.
[02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:35.042]  Gavin McGinnis did get into it with some people.
[02:49:35.162 --> 02:49:36.664]  Do you have a very short cameraman?
[02:49:43.159 --> 02:49:43.940]  There you go.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.641]  I have two cameras going at once, the Warhammers.
[02:49:46.701 --> 02:49:47.462]  Actually, I have three.
[02:49:47.482 --> 02:49:49.363]  I have a 360 camera going as well.
[02:49:49.783 --> 02:49:50.783]  So I just took out my earpiece.
[02:49:50.823 --> 02:49:51.284]  I can't hear you.
[02:49:51.304 --> 02:49:54.005]  I'm going to throw it back to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:49:54.025 --> 02:50:05.971]  This has been Rob Dew, Alex Jones, and a whole host of other good-hearted patriots here of every race, color, and creed here in Washington, D.C., the nation's capital, watching Donald Trump become the 45th President of the United States.
[02:50:06.032 --> 02:50:07.452]  And let's MAGA out there, people.
[02:50:07.472 --> 02:50:08.433]  We'll see you next time.
[02:50:08.533 --> 02:50:09.373]  And we'll be right back.
[02:50:09.433 --> 02:50:09.974]  Stay with us.
[02:50:17.313 --> 02:50:21.375]  Mark Morano, producer of Climate Hustle and publisher of Climate Depot.
[02:50:21.415 --> 02:50:22.355]  Thank you for joining us, Mark.
[02:50:22.535 --> 02:50:23.176]  Thank you, David.
[02:50:23.216 --> 02:50:23.956]  Happy to be here.
[02:50:23.996 --> 02:50:35.161]  Yes, you're completely accurate about the EPA, and even worse than what you're describing, like about the Chrysler attacks by the EPA and their alleged emissions violations.
[02:50:35.881 --> 02:50:42.024]  The Republican Congress a few years back, even under George Bush, they have statutorily killed
[02:50:42.708 --> 02:50:51.840]  The SUV in America unless Donald Trump's administration and the new Congress tries to change it and what I mean by that is you mentioned the corporate average fuel economy standards.
[02:50:52.321 --> 02:50:56.947]  They're trying to merge those or bring them in line with what vehicles have been which means
[02:50:57.848 --> 02:51:12.942]  We're talking about Ford F-150 pickups, Jeeps, everything else having to move to aluminum, much lighter weight, the shrinking, the downsizing, and so that's one of the other things they're doing aside from hassling them with these emission alleged violations.
[02:51:12.962 --> 02:51:15.345]  They're now coming after them for their weight, size,
[02:51:15.965 --> 02:51:17.326]  Materials that they're made out of.
[02:51:18.126 --> 02:51:24.149]  It's a way of essentially re-engineering American society in the face of global warming.
[02:51:24.269 --> 02:51:28.090]  And they're doing this from everything from our lightbulb to our appliances.
[02:51:28.410 --> 02:51:41.856]  You know, Consumer Reports even says that high-end washing machines don't perform as well as low-end washing machines of 15 years ago, brand new ones, because of all the Energy Department, Energy Star, sucking all the available power out of these machines.
[02:51:42.236 --> 02:51:45.257]  So they're forced to make them lighter, lightweight, lighter duty.
[02:51:46.137 --> 02:51:52.139]  It just goes on and on, and it goes all the way up to our population, whether we can eat beef, our transportation, carbon taxes.
[02:51:52.519 --> 02:52:01.742]  So Donald Trump is probably the greatest threat to this agenda that's occurred in the history of the entire modern environmental movement since 1970.
[02:52:01.862 --> 02:52:06.103]  And here's what I never understood about the never-Trumpers who allege to be conservatives.
[02:52:07.144 --> 02:52:10.347]  You get all the previous Republican nominees since Reagan.
[02:52:10.367 --> 02:52:11.569]  You have George H.W.
[02:52:11.609 --> 02:52:17.876]  Bush, who was an absolute disaster when it came to climate change issues in the United Nations and environmentalism.
[02:52:17.896 --> 02:52:22.060]  You have John McCain, who was nominated in 2008, and he was actually a
[02:52:22.921 --> 02:52:28.967]  So when it comes to Donald Trump, particularly on environment and climate, he is the greatest breath of fresh air of any Republican nominee that you could even conceive of.
[02:52:49.125 --> 02:52:56.408]  He's the only one who is not in league with both the Republican and the Democrat establishment, as you just ran down that list.
[02:52:56.508 --> 02:53:08.413]  So they know how to get their people in on both the Republican and the Democrat ticket, and this time Donald Trump broke through that to try to break this lock on power that both the Democrat and Republican establishment have had.
[02:53:20.549 --> 02:53:21.770]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:21.790 --> 02:53:23.272]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:53:23.312 --> 02:53:28.577]  We're here in Austin and of course you just saw Alex Jones with the crowd in Washington, D.C.
[02:53:28.857 --> 02:53:39.787]  We have our reporters Rob Dew and others are there in Washington covering the inauguration of President Donald J. Trump and of course he was sworn in at noon Eastern Time.
[02:53:39.807 --> 02:53:43.270]  We're going to play that for you at the top of the hour again in case you missed that.
[02:53:44.219 --> 02:53:49.762]  It's now the 45th president and we saw these pictures of Donald Trump signing all these papers and I kept saying, what is he doing?
[02:53:49.802 --> 02:53:51.362]  Is he signing executive orders or whatever?
[02:53:51.603 --> 02:54:02.788]  He had said he was going to sign, quote, some very meaningful documents, unquote, and it looked like he was going through a real estate signing, buying a house, something that Donald Trump is certainly no stranger to, but it was more significant than that.
[02:54:03.368 --> 02:54:13.930]  From what we understand, at least one of those documents was to allow General Mattis to become Secretary of Defense because there was a delay on that.
[02:54:13.990 --> 02:54:18.411]  He had not been out of the Army for the requisite amount of time, so they changed the law.
[02:54:18.691 --> 02:54:21.812]  Donald Trump has now signed that, so it clears the way for General Mattis.
[02:54:22.172 --> 02:54:32.494]  Now before we go back and cover some more of what is happening on site, I just want to remind you that we have an exclusive, limited edition lithograph of President Trump.
[02:54:33.174 --> 02:54:34.294]  This is 16 by 20.
[02:54:34.694 --> 02:54:38.715]  It's just $19.95 and you can see a picture of this on the site.
[02:54:38.755 --> 02:54:41.055]  This is the official RNC portrait artist.
[02:54:41.455 --> 02:54:45.856]  The same guy who did that iconic drawing of Ronald Reagan and the cowboy hat.
[02:54:45.936 --> 02:54:46.756]  It's very detailed.
[02:54:46.776 --> 02:54:50.597]  We have this framed here in the hallway at the office.
[02:54:50.837 --> 02:54:59.979]  It is a very beautiful, very detailed portrait of Donald Trump and you can find that $19.95 limited edition exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:00.399 --> 02:55:00.659]  Also,
[02:55:01.704 --> 02:55:06.249]  We still have our Make America Healthy Again, I guess we could call it.
[02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:08.412]  Make Our Bodies Great Again.
[02:55:08.552 --> 02:55:09.814]  Yeah, Make Our Bodies Great Again.

[02:55:51.653 --> 02:55:58.216]  It doesn't have to be a catastrophe, a political or geopolitical catastrophe to need storable food.
[02:55:58.276 --> 02:55:59.937]  Just look at what happened with the winter storms.
[02:55:59.957 --> 02:56:00.877]  We saw this last week.
[02:56:00.937 --> 02:56:01.738]  The empty shelves.
[02:56:02.495 --> 02:56:06.599]  That's something that you can also do to level out the price of your food.
[02:56:07.100 --> 02:56:10.964]  We may have price surges at various times, or the price of food may go up.
[02:56:11.044 --> 02:56:12.005]  These last for 25 years.
[02:56:13.746 --> 02:56:13.866]  No GMO.
[02:56:13.886 --> 02:56:14.486]  Made in America.
[02:56:14.886 --> 02:56:15.667]  No GMO.

[02:56:26.470 --> 02:56:32.752]  It's the way you can support us support our crew as we go to cover these events like we have Alex Jones and the rest of our reporters.
[02:56:33.492 --> 02:56:34.473]  In Washington, D. C.
[02:56:35.493 --> 02:56:50.421]  Leanne, we've got the Directors Guild of America and of course we had one of the people that they were talking to in the crowd there, who was a college student, and said it was great that Donald Trump had opened things up so that he had shut down the political correctness, which is really nothing but censorship.
[02:56:50.441 --> 02:56:52.782]  And we see an example of this with the Directors Guild of America.
[02:56:53.462 --> 02:56:57.485]  Sending around an email and saying somebody is bullying and threatening us over Donald Trump.
[02:56:57.545 --> 02:56:58.986]  This is Neo-McCarthyism.
[02:56:59.506 --> 02:57:00.807]  This is political correctness.
[02:57:00.887 --> 02:57:02.588]  These are the Neo-Cold Warriors.
[02:57:02.668 --> 02:57:07.091]  Like you see Robert De Niro pushing to say, we're going to shut this guy down.
[02:57:07.111 --> 02:57:08.372]  We've got to come after Trump.
[02:57:08.412 --> 02:57:09.413]  Trump is a bully.
[02:57:09.493 --> 02:57:11.074]  He's a raging bull and so forth.
[02:57:11.094 --> 02:57:12.895]  These are people who want war.
[02:57:13.155 --> 02:57:14.996]  Let's just call it for what it is.
[02:57:15.036 --> 02:57:15.677]  They want war.
[02:57:15.717 --> 02:57:16.878]  They're pushing for war.
[02:57:16.918 --> 02:57:17.878]  They're pushing for a Cold War.
[02:57:18.419 --> 02:57:22.882]  Absolutely irresponsible to see these people who all their lives have been telling us, no, we don't want war.
[02:57:23.722 --> 02:57:27.965]  Backing this president who gave us seven wars and a new Cold War.
[02:57:28.225 --> 02:57:29.126]  Hmm, oh well.
[02:57:29.466 --> 02:57:33.508]  And obviously people at CNN got the memo because they like to put the side-by-side photos.
[02:57:33.548 --> 02:57:38.331]  Boy, he's campaigned on his large crowds but seems to be smaller than his predecessor.
[02:57:38.371 --> 02:57:41.453]  And of course they're using photos from 8 o'clock this morning.
[02:57:41.473 --> 02:57:44.015]  I mean it's just... Yeah, we're gonna be right back.
[02:57:44.035 --> 02:57:46.477]  We're gonna replay for you Donald Trump being sworn in.
[02:57:46.737 --> 02:57:49.739]  I guess in Hollywood black lists matter, don't they?
[02:57:49.779 --> 02:57:50.819]  That's what they're gonna come after.
[02:57:50.959 --> 02:57:51.520]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:54.257 --> 02:57:56.122]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:57:57.666 --> 02:57:59.872]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:02.865 --> 02:58:10.987]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[02:58:11.967 --> 02:58:16.609]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption.
[02:58:17.189 --> 02:58:20.790]  And a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[02:58:21.170 --> 02:58:25.051]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[02:58:25.151 --> 02:58:28.111]  They made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[02:58:28.131 --> 02:58:29.632]  We now have George Soros
[02:58:30.732 --> 02:58:31.493]  As a goblin.
[02:58:32.173 --> 02:58:37.957]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[02:58:38.698 --> 02:58:43.061]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[02:58:45.303 --> 02:58:52.388]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[02:58:52.748 --> 02:58:53.328]  It's powerful.
[02:58:53.348 --> 02:58:54.389]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.
[02:58:54.649 --> 02:58:56.431]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:04.082 --> 02:59:08.185]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:08.705 --> 02:59:10.046]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:20.152 --> 02:59:26.396]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:59:26.436 --> 02:59:30.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:32.519 --> 02:59:33.620]  Everyone, please stand.
[02:59:52.216 --> 02:59:55.337]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[02:59:56.497 --> 02:59:59.178]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[02:59:59.198 --> 03:00:03.039]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[03:00:03.439 --> 03:00:05.499]  That I will faithfully execute.
[03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:08.360]  That I will faithfully execute.
[03:00:08.580 --> 03:00:11.301]  The office of President of the United States.
[03:00:11.681 --> 03:00:14.663]  The office of President of the United States.
[03:00:15.083 --> 03:00:17.044]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[03:00:17.564 --> 03:00:19.766]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[03:00:20.146 --> 03:00:22.227]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[03:00:22.687 --> 03:00:24.488]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[03:00:24.768 --> 03:00:26.789]  The Constitution of the United States.
[03:00:26.909 --> 03:00:29.311]  The Constitution of the United States.
[03:00:29.451 --> 03:00:30.291]  So help me God.
[03:00:30.531 --> 03:00:31.412]  So help me God.
[03:00:31.912 --> 03:00:33.173]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[03:01:41.661 --> 03:01:52.032]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[03:02:18.188 --> 03:02:32.869]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[03:02:38.729 --> 03:02:52.692]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[03:02:54.872 --> 03:03:02.914]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:06.082]  We will face challenges.
[03:03:06.703 --> 03:03:08.405]  We will confront hardships.
[03:03:09.046 --> 03:03:11.148]  But we will get the job done.
[03:03:12.610 --> 03:03:18.938]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[03:03:20.111 --> 03:03:31.066]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[03:03:31.747 --> 03:03:34.090]  They have been magnificent.
[03:03:34.410 --> 03:03:34.811]  Thank you.
[03:03:42.486 --> 03:03:46.888]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[03:03:47.809 --> 03:03:56.253]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another.
[03:03:56.933 --> 03:04:04.717]  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.
[03:04:12.771 --> 03:04:14.492]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[03:04:15.072 --> 03:04:16.413]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[03:04:16.633 --> 03:04:20.176]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[03:04:20.536 --> 03:04:28.300]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[03:04:28.481 --> 03:04:33.303]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:04:33.464 --> 03:04:38.907]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[03:04:39.267 --> 03:04:46.794]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[03:04:47.035 --> 03:04:51.499]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.

[03:05:21.866 --> 03:05:29.776]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:29.856 --> 03:05:32.940]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[03:05:33.752 --> 03:05:35.572]  And they're also very affordable.
[03:05:35.592 --> 03:05:35.912]  Exactly.
[03:05:35.932 --> 03:05:37.733]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[03:05:37.753 --> 03:05:41.074]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[03:05:41.114 --> 03:05:42.274]  We've both talked to them.
[03:05:42.594 --> 03:05:51.556]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[03:05:51.936 --> 03:05:52.096]  Okay?
[03:05:52.436 --> 03:05:53.516]  We refuse to screw people.
[03:05:53.876 --> 03:05:54.836]  We refuse to do that.
[03:05:55.216 --> 03:05:57.197]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[03:05:57.737 --> 03:06:04.488]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[03:06:04.888 --> 03:06:05.649]  It's a win-win.

[03:07:23.146 --> 03:07:27.256]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:07:27.997 --> 03:07:29.561]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:07:37.071 --> 03:07:38.252]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:38.272 --> 03:07:39.913]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:07:40.393 --> 03:07:43.975]  Dara McBrain and Margaret Howell are joining us in the other studio in just a moment.
[03:07:44.055 --> 03:07:45.455]  Of course, we're all here in Austin.
[03:07:45.475 --> 03:07:50.818]  We have a lot of InfoWars crew, including Alex Jones, as you've just seen in the last hour.
[03:07:50.898 --> 03:07:54.080]  Alex was there at the inauguration, was inside the inauguration.
[03:07:54.620 --> 03:07:57.023]  And then he talked to the crowd outside afterwards.
[03:07:57.724 --> 03:07:59.826]  Some great comments from the people there in the crowd.
[03:08:00.446 --> 03:08:06.553]  And now we have protesters are evidently have been triggered by the inauguration of Donald Trump.
[03:08:06.573 --> 03:08:07.834]  We've got some live footage here.
[03:08:07.854 --> 03:08:09.456]  They're already flashing with police.
[03:08:09.656 --> 03:08:20.325]  This is Fox News showing tear gas being fired at people and protesters attacking people because, you know, we cannot have a peaceful transition of power if these brats don't get their way.
[03:08:20.805 --> 03:08:21.646]  They do whatever they want.
[03:08:21.686 --> 03:08:23.107]  These are the children of Obama.
[03:08:23.127 --> 03:08:26.409]  These are people who, like Obama, don't respect the democratic process.
[03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:30.633]  He didn't get what he wanted from our elected representative, so he just did executive orders.
[03:08:30.953 --> 03:08:33.395]  These people don't get what they want out of the election, so what do they do?
[03:08:33.415 --> 03:08:36.377]  They take to the streets, they attack people, and call it free speech.
[03:08:36.457 --> 03:08:36.998]  No, it's not.
[03:08:37.378 --> 03:08:38.778]  Let's call it what it is, okay?
[03:08:38.818 --> 03:08:41.499]  They're setting fire to a crowded theater.
[03:08:41.579 --> 03:08:46.481]  This is what these people are doing and they need to be shut down and so this is back and forth.
[03:08:46.501 --> 03:08:47.541]  Gas canisters being thrown.
[03:08:47.561 --> 03:08:50.702]  Protesters just threw it back at the police there.
[03:08:50.862 --> 03:08:53.763]  I guess they deployed some to disperse the crowd.
[03:08:54.783 --> 03:08:56.485]  But obviously things are already getting wild.
[03:08:56.505 --> 03:09:02.791]  The parade hasn't even started and they had been planning these protests to go all along the parade route today.
[03:09:03.271 --> 03:09:09.196]  Of course there's about 8,000 people participating in this parade with all of these Antifa people here on the sides.
[03:09:09.497 --> 03:09:14.241]  And of course Donald Trump said he was going to be handing the power back to the people but I don't think he meant these people.
[03:09:14.441 --> 03:09:19.345]  The key thing and this is a report that's up on Infowars.com and we're going to show you this clip of this in just a moment.
[03:09:20.066 --> 03:09:32.013]  Alex Jones said what they're doing here is the DC police, who are really under the control of President Obama, these people have been standing down and allowing this to happen with the protesters.
[03:09:32.293 --> 03:09:33.534]  And that's what you need to understand.
[03:09:33.934 --> 03:09:37.616]  They have taken a non-confrontational viewpoint to allow this to happen.
[03:09:37.956 --> 03:09:38.977]  They want this to happen.
[03:09:39.017 --> 03:09:42.999]  The mainstream media is going to run with this and say, look at this, we have a divided America.
[03:09:43.499 --> 03:09:44.680]  Civil War has broken out.
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:46.201]  This is not a legitimate president.
[03:09:46.361 --> 03:09:50.084]  All the stuff that we've been hearing, that's the narrative that they want you to see.
[03:09:50.344 --> 03:09:51.705]  This is what they want to have happen.
[03:09:51.745 --> 03:09:53.886]  That's why Obama allowed this to happen.
[03:09:54.226 --> 03:10:00.550]  And the report we have up on Infowars.com is police allow BLM to attack women at the Trump inauguration.
[03:10:00.591 --> 03:10:08.176]  Of course, we've seen not only rain, but we've seen the police in DC allow the free reign of Black Lives Matter.
[03:10:08.196 --> 03:10:13.199]  And you've got an article here where you got an example of how the mainstream press is trying to
[03:10:13.839 --> 03:10:17.181]  Create a narrative saying, look, nobody showed up for Donald Trump's inauguration.
[03:10:17.461 --> 03:10:18.702]  Such a divided country here.
[03:10:18.742 --> 03:10:21.864]  People, you know, what a difference it is between him and President Obama.
[03:10:22.224 --> 03:10:25.326]  I mentioned this earlier with the optics that the media is trying to use.
[03:10:25.666 --> 03:10:26.967]  So here, this is CNN.
[03:10:27.027 --> 03:10:29.889]  If you guys can get this picture here on this iPad.
[03:10:30.569 --> 03:10:33.870]  So they say the inaugural crowd's Trump's versus Obama's.
[03:10:34.331 --> 03:10:40.813]  He campaigned on the huge crowd sizes, but the turnout for President Trump's inauguration appears to be smaller than that of his predecessor.
[03:10:40.833 --> 03:10:53.639]  And so they're using a photograph from early this morning before the crowd was even there, versus this is probably when the actual Obama's inauguration was going on.
[03:10:54.019 --> 03:11:01.866]  So they're going to just let this fake news roll out and we all saw with our own eyes as the inauguration was happening with Donald Trump, this place was packed.
[03:11:02.287 --> 03:11:11.015]  But this is what CNN fake news is saying the inauguration looked like because people are so against public enemy number one, President Donald Trump.
[03:11:11.395 --> 03:11:17.881]  And of course as you, as we began the program we were talking about the glowing terms which the mainstream media was describing.
[03:11:18.662 --> 03:11:20.104]  Obama's inauguration eight years ago.
[03:11:20.124 --> 03:11:23.447]  They're talking about the beautiful weather, how unseasonably warm it was, etc, etc.
[03:11:23.487 --> 03:11:24.548]  So this is against the weather.
[03:11:24.929 --> 03:11:32.617]  This is against the Black Lives Matter people who have been allowed to shut down the entrances getting into the inauguration area as well.
[03:11:32.677 --> 03:11:37.862]  And so they create all of this and then come out with their, see we told you so, nobody showed up.
[03:11:37.982 --> 03:11:38.663]  That's not true.
[03:11:38.823 --> 03:11:40.004]  Hillary won the popular vote.
[03:11:40.524 --> 03:11:43.366]  I want to play this clip that we have as part of this article.
[03:11:43.406 --> 03:11:47.889]  This is from our crew and Alex Jones in Washington, D.C.
[03:11:48.550 --> 03:11:56.095]  showing how Black Lives Matter was allowed to attack women, showing how the police have stood down to allow this to happen.
[03:11:56.135 --> 03:11:57.536]  Here's that clip from Alex Jones and crew.
[03:11:58.563 --> 03:12:00.225]  I pulled myself up by his testicles.
[03:12:00.866 --> 03:12:01.146]  Good!
[03:12:01.287 --> 03:12:02.768]  Now they're blocking the gates.
[03:12:02.848 --> 03:12:03.810]  Yeah, they're blocking the gates.
[03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:05.472]  They're sitting down and blocking all the gates.
[03:12:05.752 --> 03:12:06.252]  Oh, really?
[03:12:06.292 --> 03:12:07.474]  We've got a protest.
[03:12:07.494 --> 03:12:08.495]  We've got to go cut lights?
[03:12:08.575 --> 03:12:09.256]  Many protests.
[03:12:09.336 --> 03:12:09.777]  Are you ready?
[03:12:09.797 --> 03:12:10.377]  We're live.
[03:12:10.477 --> 03:12:14.742]  Okay, the leftists, now they are blocking the gates.
[03:12:14.762 --> 03:12:16.925]  Ma'am, tell folks who you are and what happened to you.
[03:12:17.045 --> 03:12:18.666]  I'm Shannon Martinez.
[03:12:18.846 --> 03:12:20.468]  I was trying to get in the gate back there.
[03:12:20.488 --> 03:12:21.829]  I went to cross the line.
[03:12:22.429 --> 03:12:24.090]  As you can see, I have a cane.
[03:12:24.130 --> 03:12:24.671]  I have RSD.
[03:12:25.071 --> 03:12:26.172]  They yanked me to the ground.
[03:12:26.392 --> 03:12:26.652]  Who did?
[03:12:26.672 --> 03:12:28.353]  They started kicking me, the protesters.
[03:12:28.594 --> 03:12:29.754]  They started kicking me.
[03:12:30.055 --> 03:12:33.277]  I got kicked in the face, and a grown man kicked me twice in the chest.
[03:12:33.697 --> 03:12:35.579]  The only thing that saved me was my motorcycle.
[03:12:35.599 --> 03:12:36.379]  Did they get arrested?
[03:12:36.560 --> 03:12:36.780]  No.
[03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:40.142]  The police were standing there when I got up and was crying.
[03:12:40.823 --> 03:12:42.924]  The police literally turned their back to me.
[03:12:43.285 --> 03:12:45.746]  The reporters were the ones that asked if I was OK.
[03:12:46.927 --> 03:12:48.068]  Where are these protesters?
[03:12:48.088 --> 03:12:49.350]  The Black Lives Matter.
[03:12:49.470 --> 03:12:51.151]  Are they still there right now?
[03:12:51.171 --> 03:12:51.732]  Yes.
[03:12:51.752 --> 03:12:53.534]  You know where John Marshall Park is?
[03:12:53.554 --> 03:12:55.516]  The entrance to John Marshall Park.
[03:12:55.936 --> 03:12:57.377]  Right, that white tent way down there.
[03:12:57.438 --> 03:12:58.378]  And they attacked you?
[03:12:58.499 --> 03:12:59.199]  They attacked me.
[03:12:59.239 --> 03:13:00.040]  They're attacking everyone.
[03:13:00.240 --> 03:13:04.244]  They literally yanked me to the ground, took my cane, and started kicking me.
[03:13:04.304 --> 03:13:06.827]  And for the sake of honesty, I think that's the only gate they were blocking.
[03:13:06.847 --> 03:13:07.748]  I didn't see that.
[03:13:08.208 --> 03:13:10.549]  They blocked the steps too.
[03:13:10.610 --> 03:13:13.231]  Did the guys go to the phone?
[03:13:13.251 --> 03:13:21.276]  But hey, we got a great president, so... Well, hey, in a little while... Okay, I'm going down there in a minute, yeah.
[03:13:21.296 --> 03:13:23.017]  Nice to meet you.
[03:13:23.477 --> 03:13:23.878]  I bless you.
[03:13:23.898 --> 03:13:25.058]  I bless you, brother.
[03:13:25.299 --> 03:13:27.740]  Hey, folks, anything you want to say, get it on TV right here.
[03:13:27.860 --> 03:13:28.941]  Can I get a selfie with you real quick?
[03:13:28.981 --> 03:13:29.481]  Yes, sir, let's do it.
[03:13:31.503 --> 03:13:37.307]  I want to say thank you Mr. Trump for taking the risk for us and trying to make this country great.
[03:13:37.327 --> 03:13:39.609]  I believe in you and I believe God will lead you.
[03:13:39.629 --> 03:13:41.610]  Get that wall up, get that middle class.
[03:13:54.940 --> 03:14:00.864]  Private industry rolling, and God bless America, and I thank Mr. Jones for all that he does.
[03:14:01.084 --> 03:14:02.264]  I am forever grateful.
[03:14:02.284 --> 03:14:02.825]  God bless you.
[03:14:02.885 --> 03:14:03.785]  I'm from California.
[03:14:03.825 --> 03:14:04.866]  Here, what's your name?
[03:14:05.166 --> 03:14:05.706]  I'm Ciarella.
[03:14:05.946 --> 03:14:07.107]  Nice to meet you.
[03:14:07.147 --> 03:14:08.948]  You want to take a picture for you?
[03:14:08.988 --> 03:14:10.929]  No, I don't have a camera.
[03:14:10.949 --> 03:14:13.330]  Somebody else do it.
[03:14:13.350 --> 03:14:14.311]  God bless you, man, for the sport.
[03:14:17.399 --> 03:14:19.361]  I saw you interview David Gergen.
[03:14:19.922 --> 03:14:21.323]  That's when I got hooked on you.
[03:14:37.688 --> 03:14:41.369]  Alright, so you heard Alex Jones doing a live report there.
[03:14:41.389 --> 03:14:42.229]  There was a small woman.
[03:14:42.249 --> 03:14:45.649]  She said a grown man knocked her to the ground, kicked her in the chest, hit her in the face.
[03:14:46.250 --> 03:14:48.590]  The police stood by and did nothing.
[03:14:49.310 --> 03:14:51.330]  It was reporters who came to her aid.
[03:14:51.991 --> 03:14:53.091]  That's what we're being told.
[03:14:53.611 --> 03:14:58.132]  We're seeing that happen and of course you can see the massive number of protesters there being given free reign.
[03:14:58.492 --> 03:14:59.392]  Black Lives Matter.
[03:14:59.732 --> 03:15:05.033]  We've got some clips that Darren and Margaret have of some other things that are happening in Washington, D.C.
[03:15:05.073 --> 03:15:05.673]  Tell us about that.
[03:15:07.093 --> 03:15:16.196]  Well, before we go to the clip, I just want to say that those protesters and the anti-Trump agitators, they're not part of the working-class heroes of America.
[03:15:16.216 --> 03:15:23.779]  You know, busy people right now, people that have saved up money and traveled for hundreds of miles, you know, on the ground, they are the most respectful people.
[03:15:23.819 --> 03:15:30.281]  The people that love Trump, hard-working people, traveling hundreds of miles just to pay their respects at the inauguration.
[03:15:30.641 --> 03:15:36.263]  And then you've got these idiot freaks that have no respect for a woman who is disabled,
[03:15:37.683 --> 03:15:43.006]  They need to turn in their Obama phones for alarm clocks.
[03:15:43.126 --> 03:15:44.627]  Seriously.
[03:15:44.847 --> 03:15:48.308]  I read somewhere that there were these mobile police stations set up.
[03:15:48.628 --> 03:15:49.709]  Why aren't they using them?
[03:15:49.749 --> 03:15:54.851]  They're supposed to be on every corner for instances like this because, you know what Darren, in some cases that's a felony.
[03:15:54.871 --> 03:15:57.632]  You can't beat up a woman and kick her on the floor.
[03:15:57.812 --> 03:15:58.453]  I mean that's just a
[03:15:59.538 --> 03:16:05.482]  And nationwide, whenever we go out to these anti-Trump rallies, it's the same talking points.
[03:16:05.762 --> 03:16:06.643]  F. Donald Trump.
[03:16:07.383 --> 03:16:08.204]  Nazi scum.
[03:16:08.264 --> 03:16:08.884]  Go home.
[03:16:09.245 --> 03:16:12.567]  You homophobic, xenophobic bastards.
[03:16:12.767 --> 03:16:12.987]  Right.
[03:16:13.207 --> 03:16:15.248]  You know, and we're invading their territorial bubbles.
[03:16:15.308 --> 03:16:16.289]  David called them brats.
[03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.609]  What's that?
[03:16:16.629 --> 03:16:17.730]  David just called them brats.
[03:16:17.950 --> 03:16:18.771]  I thought, you know what?
[03:16:19.191 --> 03:16:22.433]  I could see somebody wanting to take them over their knee, honestly.
[03:16:22.493 --> 03:16:24.694]  They need a good wallop, frankly.
[03:16:24.915 --> 03:16:26.816]  I just want to ask Jennings, do you have that clip?
[03:16:28.021 --> 03:16:28.261]  Ready?
[03:16:29.042 --> 03:16:35.867]  So apparently we have an urgent message from a liberal in distress and we want to give everybody a platform.
[03:16:35.927 --> 03:16:37.188]  Everybody should have a voice here.
[03:16:37.228 --> 03:16:40.191]  So let's listen to what this gentleman has to say.
[03:16:40.331 --> 03:16:43.653]  I think he got triggered and he's very afraid right now.
[03:16:43.673 --> 03:16:44.274]  Let's check it out.
[03:16:49.118 --> 03:16:49.558]  Uh oh.
[03:16:50.459 --> 03:16:50.879]  Can't hear it.
[03:16:51.019 --> 03:16:53.361]  Looks like we're not getting any volume here on our side.
[03:16:56.735 --> 03:16:58.776]  Well let's come back to that here in a minute.
[03:16:59.176 --> 03:17:02.377]  Isn't it just interesting though, the parade hasn't even begun.
[03:17:02.397 --> 03:17:08.620]  We're still about 45 minutes away from the parade and they're already clashing with police.
[03:17:08.680 --> 03:17:12.461]  I think they said that at least 25 arrests have already been made.
[03:17:14.302 --> 03:17:20.908]  We were looking at what Donald Trump was doing right now and everybody else is partying and you know that we saw the champagne bottles start to open on the tables.
[03:17:21.188 --> 03:17:28.475]  He's signing an executive order at the moment that would allow General Mattis to assume that position because of the conflict.
[03:17:28.495 --> 03:17:30.216]  He's making sure that that doesn't happen.
[03:17:30.256 --> 03:17:34.620]  So the man's already working and we barely finished the inauguration.
[03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:39.004]  He has a list of day one pledges right from Donald Trump and it's a tall order.
[03:17:39.344 --> 03:17:40.065]  It's a tall order.
[03:17:40.145 --> 03:17:48.213]  Repeal Obamacare, build a wall, stop Syrian immigration, no more sanctuary cities, and delete all illegal executive actions.
[03:17:48.333 --> 03:17:49.354]  That could take him all day.
[03:17:49.594 --> 03:17:52.517]  And of course some of this stuff he can't do in the first day.
[03:17:52.657 --> 03:17:54.259]  He's gonna get started, I promise you.
[03:17:54.279 --> 03:17:55.520]  He's gonna get the ball rolling.
[03:17:55.920 --> 03:18:03.968]  And if the progressives and the social justice warriors, if they hate Trump now, just wait until he makes good on all of his campaign promises.
[03:18:03.988 --> 03:18:04.228]  Right.
[03:18:04.468 --> 03:18:13.816]  I hope he can just stay focused on what he's promised and just, you know, take this 100 days to just do the work that he campaigned on and just ignore all of the craziness out on the streets.
[03:18:14.257 --> 03:18:15.958]  Because we know it's just all optics.
[03:18:16.098 --> 03:18:17.119]  It's fake news.
[03:18:17.639 --> 03:18:22.764]  And I feel like everyone really needs to just ignore what's going out on there in the streets because it's not real.
[03:18:22.824 --> 03:18:23.684]  It's not reality.
[03:18:24.125 --> 03:18:31.151]  Those people who are out there protesting, thinking that their civil rights are about to be ripped away, are not operating on reality.
[03:18:31.271 --> 03:18:32.892]  While they violate everybody else's civil
[03:18:33.092 --> 03:18:33.792]  Exactly!
[03:18:33.812 --> 03:18:35.753]  Because they're worried about their own being taken away.
[03:18:35.793 --> 03:18:37.294]  They're going to go beat on some people.
[03:18:37.334 --> 03:18:38.954]  And I think it's a blessing in disguise.
[03:18:38.974 --> 03:18:43.876]  Of course I hate to see cities burned down and I hate to see people with their First Amendment violated and all that.
[03:18:43.896 --> 03:18:47.538]  But the more these protesters act like this, the more recruits we get.
[03:18:47.618 --> 03:18:49.418]  People are waking up across the country.
[03:18:49.739 --> 03:18:50.539]  It's awesome to see.
[03:18:50.959 --> 03:18:51.600]  All right, stay with us.
[03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:52.841]  We've got to take a quick break.
[03:18:53.101 --> 03:19:00.066]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Darren McBreen, Margaret Howell, and our crew in Washington, D.C., along with Alex Jones.
[03:19:00.247 --> 03:19:07.072]  Our live coverage will continue well into tonight of the inauguration of Donald Trump, now President Trump.
[03:19:07.152 --> 03:19:07.492]  Stay with us.
[03:19:07.512 --> 03:19:08.013]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:17.654 --> 03:19:27.221]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[03:19:28.242 --> 03:19:30.043]  And so I get questions all the time over the years.
[03:19:30.824 --> 03:19:36.528]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[03:19:37.268 --> 03:19:37.908]  And it's simple.
[03:19:38.509 --> 03:19:43.611]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[03:19:44.071 --> 03:19:45.072]  And there's a nexus point.
[03:19:45.152 --> 03:19:47.933]  There's quality versus price.
[03:19:47.973 --> 03:19:49.894]  And those two points have to come together.
[03:19:50.474 --> 03:20:03.441]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[03:20:04.838 --> 03:20:06.920]  The true next generation in body armor.
[03:20:07.800 --> 03:20:14.765]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[03:20:15.586 --> 03:20:18.368]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[03:20:18.388 --> 03:20:20.810]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[03:20:20.850 --> 03:20:24.833]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[03:20:25.273 --> 03:20:26.073]  Well, believe me,
[03:20:27.174 --> 03:20:29.857]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[03:20:30.437 --> 03:20:40.866]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[03:20:41.507 --> 03:20:43.128]  It's nanotube technology.
[03:20:43.709 --> 03:20:45.250]  It's created here in Texas.
[03:20:45.890 --> 03:20:52.997]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[03:20:53.717 --> 03:20:53.937]  We've
[03:20:54.998 --> 03:20:56.058]  Went out and did some testing.
[03:20:56.479 --> 03:20:58.820]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[03:20:58.840 --> 03:21:05.302]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[03:21:05.542 --> 03:21:18.807]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[03:21:19.207 --> 03:21:20.028]  Born in Texas.
[03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:21.289]  Made in America.
[03:21:21.529 --> 03:21:24.171]  Exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[03:21:24.251 --> 03:21:25.032]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[03:21:25.092 --> 03:21:26.032]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[03:21:26.393 --> 03:21:27.714]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[03:21:27.754 --> 03:21:28.394]  It's waterproof.
[03:21:28.434 --> 03:21:28.875]  You can wear it.
[03:21:28.895 --> 03:21:29.495]  It's comfortable.
[03:21:29.555 --> 03:21:30.336]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[03:21:30.376 --> 03:21:32.698]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[03:21:33.158 --> 03:21:40.764]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[03:21:41.464 --> 03:21:45.108]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[03:21:45.148 --> 03:21:51.956]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[03:21:51.976 --> 03:21:53.317]  What did they really say about this?
[03:21:53.337 --> 03:21:54.358]  No, this is through the roof.
[03:21:54.519 --> 03:21:57.262]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[03:21:58.102 --> 03:22:01.904]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[03:22:02.004 --> 03:22:06.086]  Because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[03:22:06.586 --> 03:22:11.569]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[03:22:11.689 --> 03:22:17.152]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in official crime, I think it's like 94.
[03:22:18.052 --> 03:22:19.093]  Is pistols or shotguns.
[03:22:19.133 --> 03:22:20.373]  This stops that unless it's a slug.
[03:22:20.793 --> 03:22:21.934]  I mean, that's amazing.
[03:22:21.994 --> 03:22:25.196]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[03:22:25.456 --> 03:22:26.736]  And soon, they won't have it.
[03:22:27.076 --> 03:22:31.479]  If it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[03:22:31.639 --> 03:22:35.721]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[03:22:36.501 --> 03:22:39.863]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[03:22:39.883 --> 03:22:40.603]  People didn't believe in it.
[03:22:40.923 --> 03:22:41.964]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[03:22:42.024 --> 03:22:43.665]  I feed my horse hay.
[03:22:45.085 --> 03:22:47.187]  The Backpack Body Armor is only $200.
[03:22:48.108 --> 03:22:52.271]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[03:22:53.552 --> 03:22:55.473]  Again, fund the InfoWard.
[03:22:55.573 --> 03:22:59.496]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[03:22:59.996 --> 03:23:02.018]  It's a win-win.
[03:23:02.358 --> 03:23:02.018]  $200.
[03:23:02.598 --> 03:23:05.560]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWardStore.com.
[03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:06.341]  It's amazing.
[03:23:16.716 --> 03:23:36.001]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:36.301 --> 03:23:43.923]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Darren McGreen, Margaret Howell here in the studio and of course our reporters in Washington and now the
[03:23:44.716 --> 03:23:46.097]  Devils have taken the mask off.
[03:23:46.117 --> 03:23:47.639]  They are confronting the police there.
[03:23:47.659 --> 03:23:50.161]  It's a large mass of protesters.
[03:23:50.502 --> 03:24:01.733]  After we've had situations earlier today, as we reported, Alex Jones talked to a small woman with a cane who said she was knocked to the ground, kicked in the chest repeatedly by a large man, and the police stood by and did nothing.
[03:24:02.393 --> 03:24:03.635]  Now they are doing something.
[03:24:03.675 --> 03:24:09.621]  Now there is a massive movement of crowds as you see here being with a live stream here in the area.
[03:24:10.201 --> 03:24:13.324]  They are moving against the police and the police are moving back against them.
[03:24:13.365 --> 03:24:22.434]  You know, as we see these Obama supporters, Leanne, coming after people, breaking and vandalizing cars, breaking windows, destroying businesses.
[03:24:23.134 --> 03:24:24.894]  These truly are Obama's supporters.
[03:24:24.975 --> 03:24:28.895]  I mean, that's what he's been doing to the entire economy for the last eight years.
[03:24:28.935 --> 03:24:33.736]  He's been vandalizing the American economy, and I think we're going to see that turn around.
[03:24:33.916 --> 03:24:45.199]  Certainly, I think people have had enough of this, but understand that this law enforcement reaction that we see here, allowing the protesters to get a foothold there to do this, they all just said that they were joking, didn't they?
[03:24:45.359 --> 03:24:46.680]  Yeah, it was just a joke.
[03:24:46.700 --> 03:24:48.802]  They were only kidding, James O'Keefe.
[03:24:49.143 --> 03:25:03.757]  Well, and it's interesting because we, Margaret and I, actually talked about this, that there was a transfer of power there that the commander of the National Guard handed over his power at 12.01 once Donald Trump was sworn in.
[03:25:04.198 --> 03:25:06.160]  So the National Guard has no...
[03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:11.705]  No, has no leader as far as we know, which means, does this mean they're not going to be called out if they need to be?
[03:25:12.085 --> 03:25:16.269]  So we can kind of allow this type of activity to take place there on the streets of D.C.
[03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:20.814]  because there's no, you know, commander-in-chief there of the National Guard to call them out.
[03:25:21.154 --> 03:25:31.244]  Well, we got reports going back and forth as to whether it was let go by Obama or fired by Trump, who did not want to have him continue, because we know that the political appointees, the ambassadors, had been shut down.
[03:25:31.837 --> 03:25:34.599]  When you look at this, I mean, we've got a lot of different law enforcement groups here.
[03:25:34.699 --> 03:25:37.180]  This is not the National Guard.
[03:25:37.240 --> 03:25:38.381]  This is the D.C.
[03:25:38.461 --> 03:25:39.101]  City Police.
[03:25:39.682 --> 03:25:45.005]  All of this is really under the control of the federal government because it's not a city, really, in that sense.
[03:25:45.045 --> 03:25:45.605]  It's not a state.
[03:25:45.665 --> 03:25:46.766]  It's the District of Columbia.
[03:25:46.806 --> 03:25:47.767]  They did that on purpose.
[03:25:48.507 --> 03:25:54.671]  But this is what is disturbing, is to see that, as we saw earlier when we talked about this, the idea that
[03:25:55.592 --> 03:26:12.979]  The left is saying, we've got five bills that have been introduced in Republican legislatures by Republicans to come after people who are blocking traffic, who are obstructing the roads, saying we're not going to come after you for criminal charges, even if you kill somebody, if it's done accidentally.
[03:26:14.040 --> 03:26:23.544]  We're going to put, in some other states, we're going to have a large fine, or we're going to put people in jail for an extended amount of time, because this is not speech.
[03:26:24.324 --> 03:26:24.924]  This is not speech.
[03:26:24.944 --> 03:26:25.925]  They don't want to talk.
[03:26:26.005 --> 03:26:29.826]  When you give them a microphone, we did this, we gave them a microphone, tell us what your grievances are.
[03:26:29.986 --> 03:26:31.127]  But I'm not talking to you.
[03:26:31.447 --> 03:26:34.368]  Or he would start to talk and his leader would shut him down.
[03:26:34.428 --> 03:26:41.011]  Yeah, well and then also too a lot of people need to understand because when we were seeing these first reports coming out, oh they're going to allow people
[03:26:41.731 --> 03:26:44.493]  If they accidentally run over a protester, they can get away with it.
[03:26:44.913 --> 03:26:50.637]  Well, no, the issue is, is one, we saw in Ferguson that they were out in the middle of the street at night.
[03:26:50.697 --> 03:26:58.022]  It was completely dark and there was no indication to oncoming traffic that these people were going to be just standing in the street.
[03:26:58.122 --> 03:26:59.583]  And so they got, some got hit.
[03:27:00.223 --> 03:27:06.327]  But then you also have the protesters that were surrounding people's vehicles, beating on their cars, beating, smashing their windows.
[03:27:06.367 --> 03:27:08.749]  And I'm sorry, but if you are, you're in there with your family,
[03:27:09.509 --> 03:27:11.810]  Your first instinct is to get the hell out of there.
[03:27:11.890 --> 03:27:19.512]  So, yes, if you're endangering someone else's life, you know, if it's in one of these kind of violent protests like this, that's what we're talking about here.
[03:27:19.592 --> 03:27:23.834]  Well, they say, you know, you cannot shout fire in a crowded theater to panic people.
[03:27:23.894 --> 03:27:31.956]  And yet that's precisely what these people in the undercover investigation by James O'Keefe and Project Veritas, they said, we've got people here who are trying to panic the crowd.
[03:27:32.216 --> 03:27:34.557]  They want to stampede people out of the Deplora Ball.
[03:27:35.017 --> 03:27:36.879]  That's what they're, and they say, oh, we're just joking.
[03:27:37.159 --> 03:27:43.284]  You can't do that, and you also are not allowed to actually set fire to the theater because you don't like what's being played there, okay?
[03:27:43.484 --> 03:27:46.126]  And that's what they allowed in Germany and said that's free speech.
[03:27:46.386 --> 03:27:47.187]  Your comments, Darren.
[03:27:47.708 --> 03:27:48.008]  Margaret.
[03:27:48.993 --> 03:27:49.933]  That was funny, Darren.
[03:27:49.953 --> 03:27:50.594]  You can't set fire.
[03:27:50.614 --> 03:27:55.436]  I was just thinking about the 11-year-old kid setting a fire last night on Tucker Carlson's show.
[03:27:55.736 --> 03:27:56.916]  And just think of the parents.
[03:27:57.016 --> 03:27:58.177]  I just thought about that.
[03:27:58.197 --> 03:28:01.038]  That is parental abuse to teach your kid that that is okay.
[03:28:01.078 --> 03:28:03.079]  That is a form of neglect as far as I'm concerned.
[03:28:03.299 --> 03:28:05.060]  These people are domestic terrorists.
[03:28:05.160 --> 03:28:09.061]  It's baffling that domestic terrorism laws don't apply to this kind of behavior.
[03:28:09.081 --> 03:28:10.642]  It's like you get a free pass.
[03:28:10.722 --> 03:28:15.204]  If you hate Trump, you want to commit acts of domestic terrorism, you know, okay, check.
[03:28:15.384 --> 03:28:25.868]  Well, remember, there was a video, I think it was in New York, there was a guy that was an anti-Trump guy, and he had his two young children there, and he's pointing at, it was veterans for Trump.
[03:28:26.548 --> 03:28:28.469]  And he says, look in their eyes, look in their eyes.
[03:28:28.529 --> 03:28:31.090]  That, kids, those guys, those are the enemy.
[03:28:31.350 --> 03:28:31.630]  Right.
[03:28:31.650 --> 03:28:31.830]  Veterans.
[03:28:31.850 --> 03:28:33.791]  And these are little kids that he's teaching this hatred.
[03:28:33.811 --> 03:28:34.471]  Support a president.
[03:28:34.491 --> 03:28:34.791]  Veterans.
[03:28:34.811 --> 03:28:35.011]  Absolutely.
[03:28:35.031 --> 03:28:36.432]  Those are your enemy's kids.
[03:28:36.772 --> 03:28:37.212]  It's a shame.
[03:28:37.632 --> 03:28:38.032]  Absolutely.
[03:28:38.052 --> 03:28:38.312]  All right.
[03:28:38.352 --> 03:28:42.454]  Well, we're here in Austin and we're going to be coming right back after the break.
[03:28:42.494 --> 03:28:46.615]  We've got a special little report that we tried to play in the last segment.
[03:28:46.655 --> 03:28:47.495]  We've got that queued up.
[03:28:47.875 --> 03:28:49.256]  Liberal tears will flow.
[03:28:49.276 --> 03:28:54.057]  We're going to see one of these snowflakes up close and personal with his own personal account.
[03:28:54.077 --> 03:28:54.417]  Stay with us.
[03:28:54.437 --> 03:28:54.957]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:02.116 --> 03:29:05.117]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:06.037 --> 03:29:08.858]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:13.499 --> 03:29:19.660]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:29:20.200 --> 03:29:21.621]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:29:22.523 --> 03:29:24.404]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:29:25.024 --> 03:29:30.588]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[03:29:31.168 --> 03:29:39.153]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[03:29:39.173 --> 03:29:41.634]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[03:29:41.914 --> 03:29:46.157]  This is the best system out there that we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[03:29:46.397 --> 03:29:47.138]  This is how it works.
[03:29:47.438 --> 03:29:47.958]  You order.
[03:29:48.078 --> 03:29:48.879]  Customized or
[03:29:49.975 --> 03:29:51.436]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[03:29:51.916 --> 03:29:55.078]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[03:29:55.378 --> 03:29:59.420]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[03:29:59.640 --> 03:30:00.421]  You cannot lose.
[03:30:00.441 --> 03:30:01.541]  You're funding the Infowar.
[03:30:01.862 --> 03:30:08.605]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.

[03:30:13.388 --> 03:30:14.770]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:30:15.050 --> 03:30:16.332]  You can't survive without it.
[03:30:16.532 --> 03:30:17.433]  But where do you get it?
[03:30:17.733 --> 03:30:23.501]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[03:31:12.930 --> 03:31:20.852]  Well the man that was arrested for threatening to kill Donald Trump online, get this folks, he was in fact a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:31:21.052 --> 03:31:23.853]  Now this was reported by the Daily Mail and it's up on our website.
[03:31:24.013 --> 03:31:27.334]  This man once gave 20 grand to the DNC, not surprising.
[03:31:27.494 --> 03:31:33.256]  He was arrested by the Miami Beach Police on Tuesday of this week for threatening President-elect Trump online.
[03:31:33.536 --> 03:31:38.439]  Turns out he's a member of a prominent Northeast family that's close to the Clintons, giving that whopping money.
[03:31:38.499 --> 03:31:41.561]  And his name, Dominic Papoulo Jr., he's 51 years old.
[03:31:41.581 --> 03:31:49.307]  He sat near Hillary Clinton when she delivered the eulogy at the funeral of his mother, who died on one of the jets that flew into the World Trade Center on 9-11.
[03:31:49.607 --> 03:31:51.928]  Now, during the eulogy on October 6, 2001, in Boston,
[03:31:53.069 --> 03:31:56.513]  Hillary Clinton actually referred to him as a computer wizard.
[03:31:56.673 --> 03:32:02.238]  He's now being held, of course, in the Miami-Dade County Jail after using Twitter to threaten the life of Donald Trump.
[03:32:02.279 --> 03:32:05.562]  Now, Trump is scheduled to be sworn in this week in Washington, D.C.
[03:32:05.582 --> 03:32:09.566]  He remains incarcerated on the charge of threatening to harm a public servant.
[03:32:09.926 --> 03:32:12.129]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:32:21.073 --> 03:32:22.835]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:32:22.875 --> 03:32:24.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:46.573 --> 03:32:47.733]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:47.773 --> 03:32:54.136]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Dara McBrain, Margaret Howell, and of course our reporters in Washington, D.C.
[03:32:54.216 --> 03:32:57.137]  We've been looking at some live feed, and yes, it is live.
[03:32:57.157 --> 03:32:59.798]  We've had some people pushing back and saying, this happened earlier.
[03:32:59.838 --> 03:33:01.098]  Well, I'm sure it did happen earlier.
[03:33:01.359 --> 03:33:02.599]  It is also still happening now.
[03:33:02.619 --> 03:33:07.361]  We've got live feed from Time Magazine, from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
[03:33:08.061 --> 03:33:10.803]  As well as video that we're seeing from Fox News.
[03:33:10.863 --> 03:33:15.887]  I'm not sure if the Fox News was earlier, but I think that is also live that is going on right now.
[03:33:15.927 --> 03:33:19.909]  But we do know we have live feed from Time Magazine from CBC that's happening as well.
[03:33:20.130 --> 03:33:21.150]  So, there you go.
[03:33:21.490 --> 03:33:22.031]  Take your pick.
[03:33:22.051 --> 03:33:25.293]  Do you want the feed from earlier today or do you want what's going on now?
[03:33:25.353 --> 03:33:26.394]  But that's the bottom line.
[03:33:26.754 --> 03:33:27.675]  That's what they're doing.
[03:33:28.255 --> 03:33:32.356]  Now I want to go back to Darren McBreen and Margaret Howell.
[03:33:32.416 --> 03:33:41.719]  You had actually one of these precious snowflakes was telling us a very personal clip about how he felt about this and what he was going to do.
[03:33:41.739 --> 03:33:44.160]  Let's go back to Darren and Margaret.
[03:33:44.420 --> 03:33:48.281]  This is an urgent message from a liberal in distress.
[03:33:49.501 --> 03:33:55.883]  So we take you now to an underground bunker deep in the heart of the land of idiocracy.
[03:33:58.919 --> 03:34:01.560]  Well, here we are, folks, at the end of everything.
[03:34:01.581 --> 03:34:05.523]  Human civilization, as we know it, is coming crashing down.
[03:34:06.944 --> 03:34:07.724]  The world is over.
[03:34:07.804 --> 03:34:10.045]  Donald Trump will be sworn in this week.
[03:34:11.346 --> 03:34:12.166]  And then it's all over.
[03:34:12.447 --> 03:34:13.227]  It's all over, guys.
[03:34:13.947 --> 03:34:14.628]  I'm so scared.
[03:34:14.888 --> 03:34:17.269]  I'm so alone and so scared.
[03:34:18.330 --> 03:34:19.210]  This can't be real.
[03:34:19.230 --> 03:34:20.311]  Please don't leave us.
[03:34:20.331 --> 03:34:24.333]  We elected for the first time someone who is selfish, dishonest, egotistical.
[03:34:24.353 --> 03:34:25.354]  For the first time.
[03:34:25.474 --> 03:34:27.015]  And we could have had Hillary Clinton instead.
[03:34:28.297 --> 03:34:29.498]  And now we're going to pay the price.
[03:34:30.819 --> 03:34:32.800]  We can survive this, okay?
[03:34:32.940 --> 03:34:35.462]  We can survive it, but you have to get underground.
[03:34:36.403 --> 03:34:41.947]  And I am at my mom's house where I've been temporarily rooming for the last 31 years.
[03:34:42.568 --> 03:34:45.670]  And I'm down in the basement, as you can see.
[03:34:45.870 --> 03:34:48.492]  I've made kind of a bunker for myself here in the basement.
[03:34:49.434 --> 03:34:52.897]  You've got to get underground now because we don't have a lot of time.
[03:34:53.377 --> 03:35:01.804]  Look, based on everything that I've read on Facebook, right after the inauguration, Donald Trump is going to drop a nuclear bomb.
[03:35:02.782 --> 03:35:04.203]  Gender non-conforming.
[03:35:21.429 --> 03:35:26.653]  100 billion gallons of oil into the ocean in order to kill all of the dolphins.
[03:35:27.594 --> 03:35:35.981]  And then, based on what I've heard from people like Keith Olbermann, he is going to blow up Jupiter with a death ray.
[03:35:37.242 --> 03:35:44.688]  And finally, the last act of cruelty and sadism, the last straw for all mankind will be when he blocks
[03:35:45.737 --> 03:35:47.979]  CNN reporters on Twitter.
[03:35:48.560 --> 03:35:56.046]  This is all going to unfold very quickly, so you need to prepare yourself now, and if you have not been stocking supplies and foods, you've got to do that.
[03:35:57.027 --> 03:36:08.177]  I have all of the supplies I'm going to need to survive the apocalypse right here, and I wanted to show you a few of the things I have just to give you some idea of what you need to have to be prepared for.
[03:36:08.257 --> 03:36:11.960]  You're obviously going to need a lot of non-perishable food items.
[03:36:12.981 --> 03:36:20.223]  You know, after the election we had a lot of liberals going down and stocking up on guns for a change.
[03:36:20.763 --> 03:36:22.184]  And you know, they were very afraid of this.
[03:36:22.204 --> 03:36:23.384]  I mean, that's a great parody piece.
[03:36:23.584 --> 03:36:25.004]  But let's talk about what you really do need.
[03:36:41.769 --> 03:36:42.010]  Okay.
[03:36:42.050 --> 03:36:53.039]  We do have, in case all of you liberals now who realize that you need to prepare for situations like this, as well as for conservatives who aren't going to drop out, we have InfoWars select storable food, 30-40% off.
[03:36:53.339 --> 03:36:55.601]  That's part of our inauguration special.
[03:36:56.121 --> 03:37:00.825]  And that's for people, not just because you're afraid of Donald Trump, but because you realize that you live in a real world.
[03:37:00.865 --> 03:37:03.267]  We have a very fragile, complicated infrastructure.
[03:37:03.607 --> 03:37:14.512]  As we see, every time there's a snowstorm, all the snowflakes, you need to understand this as well, that you may also find empty shelves, just like the countries that you admire, like Venezuela.
[03:37:15.233 --> 03:37:21.476]  If you go down this path, you follow Sandinista economics, you're going to have empty shelves like Venezuela.
[03:37:21.516 --> 03:37:26.358]  But even if that doesn't happen, the next time a snowstorm comes through, you could wind up not having any food.
[03:37:27.278 --> 03:37:34.240]  30-40% off, that's all made in the U.S., it's storable, it's not going to spoil like the yogurt that he was holding up there.
[03:37:34.861 --> 03:37:41.062]  You want something that is going to be packed to last for a while, that doesn't have any GMO, and that is resealable as well.
[03:37:41.102 --> 03:37:45.824]  We also have continued our 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[03:37:46.384 --> 03:37:57.534]  That's 30 to 20% off our biggest sellers at InfoWarsLive, things like Super Male Vitality, Brain Force Plus, and Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, all 30% off.
[03:37:57.594 --> 03:38:04.940]  We have, at 20% off, we have Secret 12, Vitamin B12, that's our liquid formulation, very easy to take, very easy for your body to assimilate.
[03:38:05.201 --> 03:38:12.867]  Also, Knockout, that's our all-natural sleep formula, that's 20% off as well, and many others you'll find at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:38:14.028 --> 03:38:15.729]  Back to you, Darren and Margaret.
[03:38:15.869 --> 03:38:16.729]  That was a great clip you found.
[03:38:16.769 --> 03:38:18.090]  How long is he going to stay down there?
[03:38:18.150 --> 03:38:18.490]  Do we know?
[03:38:18.510 --> 03:38:20.110]  That poor baby!
[03:38:20.290 --> 03:38:22.131]  That poor little boy!
[03:38:22.151 --> 03:38:25.592]  I mean, he really, you could feel his, he really believes it.
[03:38:26.293 --> 03:38:27.573]  I mean, that poor little boy.
[03:38:27.593 --> 03:38:30.554]  We should get that guy on the show.
[03:38:30.594 --> 03:38:31.215]  He's pretty good.
[03:38:31.335 --> 03:38:33.635]  I mean, you don't think he really actually felt that way.
[03:38:33.776 --> 03:38:36.497]  I mean, I can't tell if he was joking or not.
[03:38:36.517 --> 03:38:37.537]  Of course he was just joking.
[03:38:37.717 --> 03:38:38.757]  No, that was a joke.
[03:38:39.018 --> 03:38:42.459]  I mean, we do know people out there like that.
[03:38:42.479 --> 03:38:43.179]  We've seen them.
[03:38:43.999 --> 03:38:47.761]  He's making fun of what a lot of them act just like.
[03:38:47.781 --> 03:38:48.321]  That's true.
[03:38:48.341 --> 03:38:53.363]  We've seen so many that it's hard to tell if he was serious or joking.
[03:38:53.983 --> 03:39:03.694]  Hey, you know we were talking about how the behavior of the leftists when they do these protests and everything and we're just getting more and more new recruits the more they behave this way.
[03:39:04.595 --> 03:39:10.641]  Bikers for Trump, who are at the inauguration today, you know they are 250,000 strong right now and they are getting 25,000 new recruits every single week.
[03:39:10.681 --> 03:39:11.122]  That is amazing.
[03:39:16.207 --> 03:39:22.392]  Leanne and I met some bikers at the RNC and they were the most gracious, gentle, the bikers for Trump.
[03:39:22.432 --> 03:39:24.093]  They were awesome, awesome people.
[03:39:24.373 --> 03:39:29.497]  They should have like an adoption program where they adopt an FGW and sort of deprogram them a little.
[03:39:29.517 --> 03:39:30.378]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[03:39:30.398 --> 03:39:31.859]  You know, maybe that might help.
[03:39:31.879 --> 03:39:33.000]  Spend the day with a biker.
[03:39:33.020 --> 03:39:34.401]  Spend the day with a biker for Trump.
[03:39:34.461 --> 03:39:36.002]  That might toughen them up a little bit.
[03:39:36.863 --> 03:39:37.143]  Maybe.
[03:39:38.732 --> 03:39:43.055]  Well, yeah, they said they were going to have a wall of meat, so I guess we haven't seen them yet.
[03:39:43.355 --> 03:39:45.536]  We've seen these live broadcasts.
[03:39:45.556 --> 03:39:49.098]  Yeah, they need to get over there where they're clashing with police.
[03:39:49.318 --> 03:39:54.842]  Well, you know, I think it's interesting as we look at this, and of course, we know what would have happened if Hillary Clinton
[03:39:55.502 --> 03:39:56.603]  Had won, don't we?
[03:39:56.823 --> 03:39:58.144]  We know what that speech would have been like.
[03:39:58.344 --> 03:40:00.526]  It would have been about me, me, me, me, me.
[03:40:00.866 --> 03:40:02.067]  Women, women, women, women.
[03:40:02.327 --> 03:40:02.688]  Okay?
[03:40:02.848 --> 03:40:04.569]  And Donald Trump really shut that down.
[03:40:04.609 --> 03:40:09.013]  He said this isn't about transfer of power from a party to another party.
[03:40:09.053 --> 03:40:11.254]  It isn't about transfer from one individual to another.
[03:40:11.314 --> 03:40:18.920]  And we can say it's not about transfer of power from one sex to another, or transfer of power from one race to another.
[03:40:19.561 --> 03:40:21.062]  It's about we the people.
[03:40:21.122 --> 03:40:22.423]  And that's what Donald Trump talked about.
[03:40:22.763 --> 03:40:31.012]  45 times he talked about we the people, only mentioned himself three times in that speech, and yet we see exactly the opposite of that with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:31.032 --> 03:40:36.838]  They're glass ceiling, they talk about, and yet what they're shattering are the windows and businesses there.
[03:40:36.858 --> 03:40:38.459]  And that is not free speech.
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:40.321]  Sorry, that's not free speech.
[03:40:40.662 --> 03:40:44.746]  That is nothing but vandalism, terrorism, violence committed against people.
[03:40:44.766 --> 03:40:45.927]  That is not free speech.
[03:40:46.387 --> 03:40:55.510]  And I also really appreciated how he pointed out to other nations, you know, it's every nation's sovereign right out there to put the interests of their country first.
[03:40:55.590 --> 03:40:57.771]  And America hasn't been doing that for such a long time.
[03:40:57.811 --> 03:41:12.695]  We're weakening ourselves and it is our sovereign right to be able to do that, which of course we know with the United Nations, their agenda is to totally take the sovereignty away from nations and give it to the one world power, the one world government.
[03:41:13.175 --> 03:41:25.223]  So, I mean, you could just see him giving that message specifically to all those people sitting behind him who are responsible for that, who are witnessing that power being siphoned right from their fingertips.
[03:41:25.303 --> 03:41:26.204]  How incredible!
[03:41:26.874 --> 03:41:28.774]  Yeah, he's putting America first.
[03:41:29.995 --> 03:41:33.575]  And, you know, this is not just about Donald Trump becoming president.
[03:41:33.635 --> 03:41:37.476]  This is about the American people invading Washington, D.C.
[03:41:37.556 --> 03:41:39.156]  and taking our country back.
[03:41:39.396 --> 03:41:40.656]  It's really inspiring.
[03:41:40.757 --> 03:41:45.917]  I mean, for us to have reclaimed our birthright, other nations will follow suit and they will do the same.
[03:41:46.237 --> 03:41:48.478]  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I don't know if you've noticed this online.
[03:41:48.758 --> 03:41:51.718]  We get so many comments, love from Ireland, love from France.
[03:41:51.778 --> 03:41:52.379]  We love you guys.
[03:41:52.399 --> 03:41:53.919]  We're watching you here in Morocco.
[03:41:55.139 --> 03:41:56.880]  It's 1776 worldwide.
[03:41:56.980 --> 03:41:58.361]  It's literally going global.
[03:41:58.561 --> 03:41:59.162]  It's global.
[03:41:59.262 --> 03:42:03.965]  During the inauguration speech, he said, we are transferring power from Washington, D.C.
[03:42:04.025 --> 03:42:05.146]  to the American people.
[03:42:05.666 --> 03:42:13.351]  January 20th, 2017 will be known as the day when the people took control of the nation once again.
[03:42:14.151 --> 03:42:14.791]  I mean, there you go.
[03:42:14.851 --> 03:42:16.292]  And he also talked a lot about God.
[03:42:16.332 --> 03:42:19.173]  We were talking about that, and you know, Obama would never do that in an inauguration.
[03:42:19.193 --> 03:42:20.253]  You and I mentioned this off camera.
[03:42:20.273 --> 03:42:22.994]  He sounds so much like JFK in parts of these speeches.
[03:42:23.334 --> 03:42:26.196]  In the speech that he gave, you know, he was reminiscent of JFK.
[03:42:26.216 --> 03:42:27.576]  You know, it was just amazing.
[03:42:27.616 --> 03:42:30.957]  Like, little snippets of that, you could really see... That will live on forever.
[03:42:30.977 --> 03:42:31.197]  Absolutely.
[03:42:31.217 --> 03:42:31.878]  It will live on forever.
[03:42:31.898 --> 03:42:31.958]  Yep.
[03:42:32.158 --> 03:42:40.581]  Well, you know, as we saw Joe Biden give his farewell address to his sponsors and producers there at Davos, right?
[03:42:41.101 --> 03:42:42.363]  I'd like to thank my producers.
[03:42:42.623 --> 03:42:45.806]  He could have held up a Golden Globe, a Golden Globalist Award, right?
[03:42:45.846 --> 03:42:46.507]  That's what he got.
[03:42:46.787 --> 03:42:54.456]  And I'd like to thank all of those who made this possible, all you eight billionaires who own as much as the bottom half of the world.
[03:42:54.556 --> 03:43:01.003]  So, you know, and that went down from 62 to only eight people having the same amount of wealth as the bottom half of the world.
[03:43:01.644 --> 03:43:06.048]  That's why Donald Trump said their victories have not been your victories.
[03:43:06.208 --> 03:43:08.210]  Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:09.330]  We're going to change that.
[03:43:09.391 --> 03:43:10.111]  You want jobs?
[03:43:10.131 --> 03:43:11.472]  You want safe places to live?
[03:43:11.853 --> 03:43:14.235]  That's a reasonable thing to request.
[03:43:14.355 --> 03:43:15.796]  It is not unreasonable.
[03:43:15.876 --> 03:43:16.837]  It is not racist.
[03:43:16.977 --> 03:43:19.099]  It's not xenophobic to want that.
[03:43:19.119 --> 03:43:20.380]  That's what everybody wants.
[03:43:20.500 --> 03:43:21.661]  And so we're going to make that happen.
[03:43:21.681 --> 03:43:24.263]  We're going to bring back the American dream and we're going to do it for Americans.
[03:43:24.423 --> 03:43:32.627]  Right, I'm actually, I was looking at a story on Drudge earlier, how one of the worries they have at Davos is with this automation and how it's going to kill even more jobs.
[03:43:32.967 --> 03:43:34.428]  They're not worried about that.
[03:43:34.508 --> 03:43:35.129]  No, they want it.
[03:43:35.629 --> 03:43:50.997]  When I spoke with the man who wrote AI, he had just left Davos last year, and he said, I said, wouldn't it be great though, if automated, then everyone will just be free to self-actualize, they'd have the freedom, they wouldn't have to slave away, and he said, that would be terrible.
[03:43:51.597 --> 03:43:54.020]  Millions of people free to do whatever they want?
[03:43:54.040 --> 03:43:55.762]  That's what they want with universal basic income.
[03:43:55.782 --> 03:44:02.729]  They want to pacify you and understand that when they give you universal basic income, they're also going to take away your right to work.
[03:44:02.769 --> 03:44:05.272]  And I gotta say this, back when I had a business, right?
[03:44:05.852 --> 03:44:10.878]  We kept hearing that, you know, welfare is a right, but if I wanted to open up a business, I had to get a privilege license.
[03:44:10.938 --> 03:44:11.759]  I said, think about this.
[03:44:12.099 --> 03:44:14.961]  You know, if I want to work, if I want to start a business, that's a privilege.
[03:44:15.421 --> 03:44:16.882]  If I want to go on welfare, that's a right.
[03:44:17.302 --> 03:44:23.165]  They will give you universal basic income, but they will treat you the way our government has treated Indians on a reservation.
[03:44:23.205 --> 03:44:24.526]  They will contain you in an area.
[03:44:24.926 --> 03:44:26.627]  They will tell you what you can and cannot do.
[03:44:27.027 --> 03:44:31.270]  They will take your kids away, remove them from you, and educate them to their values.
[03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:33.331]  That's what they have been doing to the American Indians.
[03:44:33.451 --> 03:44:38.514]  That's what the UN Agenda 21, the agenda for 2030, sustainability, that's what that's about.
[03:44:38.954 --> 03:44:41.318]  Universal basic income is to pacify us.
[03:44:41.698 --> 03:44:43.080]  It's a soft kill method.
[03:44:43.340 --> 03:44:50.651]  It is to make us dependent on them and to take away our ability to work, to think, to be productive human beings, to essentially have a fulfilled life.
[03:44:50.771 --> 03:44:54.737]  They want to take that away and make us passive prisoners in their system.
[03:44:55.177 --> 03:45:05.325]  Right, and these protesters out here who are clashing against capitalism and what they see as the enemy, they're wanting that universal basic income.
[03:45:05.365 --> 03:45:11.390]  The system they say hasn't worked for them, it's failed for them, and they don't want to have to work, they don't want to have to pay back those student loans.
[03:45:11.951 --> 03:45:15.874]  Nobody told them to get a degree in social justice warrior business.
[03:45:17.555 --> 03:45:24.460]  I mean, I can understand people have some issues, of course, but a lot of people are saying, let's give this man a chance.
[03:45:24.781 --> 03:45:25.901]  Let's see what he can do.
[03:45:25.921 --> 03:45:30.765]  You know, he's coming in there totally opposite of the establishment they're trying to tear down.
[03:45:30.785 --> 03:45:33.207]  Like, Darren, you remember John Lennon?
[03:45:33.287 --> 03:45:35.829]  All we're saying is, give Trump a chance.
[03:45:35.869 --> 03:45:37.771]  Give Trump a chance.
[03:45:37.871 --> 03:45:42.995]  A lot of these guys don't want, they don't want to live off the Democratic plantation.
[03:45:43.535 --> 03:45:45.797]  They're comfortable there, they want to stay there, they don't want to
[03:45:46.317 --> 03:45:47.358]  You know, work hard.
[03:45:48.519 --> 03:45:53.103]  If you manage to get a small business in this country to go and employ people, you're taxed to death.
[03:45:53.183 --> 03:45:56.125]  You know, you have to provide these new health care mandates.
[03:45:56.446 --> 03:45:58.067]  You have to cut your employee workforce.
[03:45:58.147 --> 03:46:03.251]  I mean, just a lot, so many regulations bogging down small business owners in this country.
[03:46:03.311 --> 03:46:06.854]  You know, it's almost, there is that push just to say, I quit.
[03:46:07.074 --> 03:46:07.475]  I quit.
[03:46:07.735 --> 03:46:08.896]  Just, I'll take my little part.
[03:46:08.936 --> 03:46:09.476]  Just give it to me.
[03:46:09.537 --> 03:46:09.817]  I quit.
[03:46:10.390 --> 03:46:13.473]  Well, and we're taking a look at all these protests that are going on right now.
[03:46:13.573 --> 03:46:14.514]  Wait until this evening.
[03:46:15.034 --> 03:46:19.639]  And that's why we're going to stay live until late tonight or maybe 10, 11, 12 o'clock.
[03:46:20.079 --> 03:46:23.242]  Because once it gets dark, that's when all the freaks come out.
[03:46:23.422 --> 03:46:27.847]  And I promise you, it's going to get ugly this evening in certain portions of D.C.
[03:46:28.347 --> 03:46:29.208]  And we'll be there to cover it.
[03:46:29.568 --> 03:46:31.849]  I was waiting for the fire extinguisher.
[03:46:32.369 --> 03:46:35.830]  Somebody was setting fire to some garbage in the street just a moment ago.
[03:46:35.850 --> 03:46:38.171]  I'm like, where are the police with a fire extinguisher?
[03:46:38.651 --> 03:46:40.692]  It looks like they have finally stepped up.
[03:46:40.732 --> 03:46:43.353]  Somebody had one in hand, so let's just hope it doesn't get too crazy.
[03:46:43.693 --> 03:46:49.295]  Yeah, and we see now there's sort of a wall of riot cops and then the wall of protesters.
[03:46:49.775 --> 03:46:51.215]  Where is the parade going to begin?
[03:46:51.275 --> 03:46:56.097]  Where are going to be the 8,000 people who are going to be participating in the parade itself?
[03:46:56.137 --> 03:46:58.238]  That doesn't even include the spectators.
[03:46:58.578 --> 03:46:59.859]  Where's the underdog balloons?
[03:46:59.999 --> 03:47:00.639]  I don't know.
[03:47:00.759 --> 03:47:01.920]  And the mummers, you know.
[03:47:01.940 --> 03:47:03.501]  Is that the right parade?
[03:47:03.541 --> 03:47:03.921]  I don't know.
[03:47:04.061 --> 03:47:10.684]  I'm not sure what feed we have behind us, but it just had a kind of an image of them setting up for the parade.
[03:47:10.724 --> 03:47:12.665]  And you can see the streets are set aside.
[03:47:12.745 --> 03:47:17.148]  So are these riders going to come in from the sides and kind of
[03:47:17.688 --> 03:47:18.749]  Well they bust them all in.
[03:47:18.849 --> 03:47:19.810]  There's a lot of them out there.
[03:47:20.090 --> 03:47:23.654]  And it's always very interesting to see how the mainstream media portrays this.
[03:47:23.674 --> 03:47:27.437]  I always monitor the mainstream media at night and kind of see how they cover this.
[03:47:28.058 --> 03:47:34.804]  And last night, over and over, it was just the scrolling ticker at the bottom whenever you would see Donald Trump, and just repeatedly
[03:47:34.944 --> 03:47:36.665]  In your brain, in your brain, in your brain.
[03:47:36.725 --> 03:47:39.806]  It was the most unpopular president in history.
[03:47:39.946 --> 03:47:41.826]  Incoming president, most, at least unpopular.
[03:47:42.146 --> 03:47:49.228]  Based on their phony polls, the same polls that said 80% chance Hillary Clinton's gonna win the presidency the day of the election.
[03:47:49.648 --> 03:47:51.069]  So, I mean, you know, come on.
[03:47:51.249 --> 03:47:54.390]  No one's falling for it anymore, but hey, I guess some people are.
[03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:59.316]  Well, and it's all about how we're losing the classiest, greatest president ever.
[03:47:59.396 --> 03:48:06.646]  You know, it's like, sure, yeah, class and grace are great qualities of a leader, but that does not mean he did a great job leading this country.
[03:48:06.666 --> 03:48:09.751]  I think he was like the fourth worst with economics.
[03:48:10.451 --> 03:48:11.552]  That's right.
[03:48:28.561 --> 03:48:29.141]  Good riddance.
[03:48:29.161 --> 03:48:29.401]  Okay.
[03:48:29.421 --> 03:48:35.443]  Well, you know, you had those pictures, Leanne, that CNN was putting up and saying, look, you know, here's the area, of course.
[03:48:36.263 --> 03:48:39.464]  It was a difference in time, I believe, but it was also a difference in weather.
[03:48:39.484 --> 03:48:47.346]  It was also a difference in the fact that conservatives who didn't like Barack Obama didn't attack the left as they had their inaugural.
[03:48:47.366 --> 03:48:49.006]  We let them celebrate their victory.
[03:48:49.506 --> 03:49:03.080]  And I'm sure that they're going to show this picture that's over here to the side of me and say, look at this, you know, there's nobody at all at the inauguration because it's completely empty down here and you've got the place where not even Trump is there, you know, and so I'm sure that's the picture they're going to use.
[03:49:03.280 --> 03:49:07.605]  They had push-polls, I guess they're going to have push-pictures, you know, that they're going to use to push the narrative.
[03:49:08.044 --> 03:49:08.925]  Owen covered it last night.
[03:49:08.965 --> 03:49:10.287]  CNN was perched up on a roof.
[03:49:10.447 --> 03:49:11.108]  Now we know why.
[03:49:11.148 --> 03:49:14.692]  They wanted an aerial shot of the ground before anybody got there.
[03:49:14.712 --> 03:49:15.313]  Exactly.
[03:49:15.333 --> 03:49:16.654]  They were up so high.
[03:49:16.674 --> 03:49:18.477]  We're like, what are they doing up there?
[03:49:18.497 --> 03:49:20.539]  Hiding from everybody on a building.
[03:49:20.799 --> 03:49:23.342]  Turns out they wanted to get some fake pictures and push some fake news.
[03:49:23.402 --> 03:49:24.163]  I mean, that makes sense.
[03:49:25.224 --> 03:49:26.485]  Well, CNN's in big trouble.
[03:49:27.205 --> 03:49:29.047]  Their ratings are just, you know.
[03:49:29.187 --> 03:49:31.428]  Meanwhile, independent media, skyrocketing.
[03:49:32.949 --> 03:49:41.534]  I think it's also kind of interesting that as Hillary Clinton was introduced and showed up, and this is reported from Philadelphia CBS local, they say Trump supporters chant,
[03:49:42.074 --> 03:49:42.514]  Lock her up!
[03:49:43.075 --> 03:49:48.279]  When Hillary Clinton was announced at the inauguration and there's several people tweeted this out.
[03:49:48.319 --> 03:49:49.920]  Some of the crowd are chanting, lock her up.
[03:49:50.460 --> 03:49:51.601]  We can still hope that will happen.
[03:49:51.681 --> 03:49:52.502]  Hey, no pardon!
[03:49:52.642 --> 03:49:53.543]  She didn't get pardoned!
[03:49:53.683 --> 03:49:54.083]  That's right.
[03:49:54.103 --> 03:49:54.323]  That's true.
[03:49:54.363 --> 03:49:54.864]  That's right.
[03:49:54.924 --> 03:49:55.704]  It's too late now.
[03:49:56.105 --> 03:49:56.845]  Too late now.
[03:49:57.205 --> 03:49:58.106]  So he's gone.
[03:49:58.146 --> 03:49:58.807]  No pardon for her.
[03:49:59.107 --> 03:50:00.128]  All right, we're going to be right back.
[03:50:00.348 --> 03:50:05.912]  David Knight, Leanne McAdoo, Dara McBrain, Margaret Howell, and our crew, and Alex Jones in Washington, D.C.
[03:50:05.952 --> 03:50:10.876]  This is our live coverage of the inauguration of Donald Trump, now President Trump.
[03:50:11.598 --> 03:50:12.126]  Deal with it.
[03:50:17.455 --> 03:50:22.178]  He is a president of B&E Legal, seasoned professional with more than 25 years of experience.
[03:50:22.218 --> 03:50:24.140]  He's worked for Congressman Steve Largett.
[03:50:24.200 --> 03:50:28.422]  He's worked for many offices and campaigns in U.S.
[03:50:28.442 --> 03:50:29.843]  Senators and U.S.
[03:50:29.963 --> 03:50:30.444]  Congressmen.
[03:50:31.024 --> 03:50:36.348]  He has participated in numerous issue campaigns, including anti-tax and deregulation initiatives.
[03:50:36.368 --> 03:50:38.829]  The website is eelegal.org.
[03:50:39.290 --> 03:50:43.553]  And of course, hopefully we are going to see some deregulation from the EPA.
[03:50:43.593 --> 03:50:47.295]  Let's talk about, let's talk about first, what do you think is going to happen
[03:50:48.095 --> 03:50:55.900]  I don't think you could have, again, picked a better person than Attorney General Scott Pruitt for many reasons.
[03:50:56.520 --> 03:51:02.383]  For those who don't know, he is Attorney General from Oklahoma, a very important energy-producing state.
[03:51:02.663 --> 03:51:13.029]  Philosophically, he is a Federalist, meaning he understands that this overreach by the federal government over the last, you know, 40, 50 years, and most particularly the last eight,
[03:51:14.089 --> 03:51:19.352]  Uh, is not healthy for, uh, the economy and also not healthy for the environment.
[03:51:19.372 --> 03:51:22.194]  So I expect great changes, uh, I saw in your lead up.
[03:51:22.994 --> 03:51:28.758]  This president, uh, going out has been more prolific than any other I can ever remember in history.
[03:51:28.838 --> 03:51:32.820]  I, I think somebody needs to remind him that his side lost and it's time for him to pack up and go.
[03:51:33.160 --> 03:51:51.379]  And now they're going through, after coming close to bankrupting the coal industry during his eight years, in his final days, it looks like they're trying to bankrupt one car company after the other for the sin of creating an internal combustion engine because they can't do enough to subsidize the battery-run cars.
[03:51:51.639 --> 03:51:53.261]  People don't want to buy the electric cars.
[03:51:53.461 --> 03:51:54.202]  They're not there yet.
[03:51:54.222 --> 03:51:55.503]  The technology is not there yet.
[03:51:55.563 --> 03:51:56.424]  It's not as durable.
[03:51:56.944 --> 03:52:00.106]  This administration, meaning the one that's about to leave, thank God,
[03:52:26.102 --> 03:52:28.243]  They literally came in there on day one.
[03:52:28.263 --> 03:52:33.164]  I mean, we found documents going back to the same time period eight years ago, leading up to the transition.
[03:52:33.184 --> 03:52:37.125]  But they had that game plan in place, which ultimately became the Clean Power Plan.
[03:52:37.485 --> 03:52:38.545]  They were going to come in.
[03:52:38.925 --> 03:52:42.986]  They had already identified coal-fired power plants that they were going to shut down.
[03:52:43.446 --> 03:52:46.587]  They came in with a plan, and you mentioned it's all part of the U.N.'
[03:52:46.567 --> 03:52:49.788]  's effort as well at the international level, but that's essentially the plan.
[03:52:49.808 --> 03:52:50.908]  The plan was to shut down
[03:52:51.508 --> 03:52:59.291]  Call first, open up the renewable energy markets, push that all to their green corporate friends and like Tom Sauer who already set up in there.
[03:52:59.531 --> 03:53:04.513]  And as well as just trying to completely control how much energy is used by the American public.
[03:53:04.833 --> 03:53:10.996]  And as we've seen too after eight years, completely devastating the energy, the overall energy markets.
[03:53:25.235 --> 03:53:26.556]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:53:26.616 --> 03:53:33.661]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Dara McBrain, Margaret Howell here in Austin, and of course we'll be going back to our crew in Washington, D.C.
[03:53:33.741 --> 03:53:39.184]  The inaugural parade is going to be starting in about 5-10 minutes or so.
[03:53:39.625 --> 03:53:44.188]  We'll be carrying that for you, but also we'll have some more clips of Donald Trump's speech.
[03:53:44.768 --> 03:53:49.191]  Where he said, this is not about transferring power to a person or a party, but to the American people.
[03:53:49.711 --> 03:53:55.434]  And we are going to take control of the government by the people, rather than the people being controlled by the government.
[03:53:55.454 --> 03:53:56.314]  It was a great speech.
[03:53:57.135 --> 03:54:02.778]  And people that Alex talked to, and of course Alex was very happy about what we all heard.
[03:54:02.838 --> 03:54:08.081]  I think it was exactly the type of return to first principles, American principles that we wanted to hear.
[03:54:08.661 --> 03:54:10.421]  So we're all very optimistic at this point.
[03:54:10.441 --> 03:54:13.742]  We want to give Donald Trump a chance, but the people who are there don't.
[03:54:14.302 --> 03:54:17.603]  We've got a lot of protesters in the area.
[03:54:18.323 --> 03:54:23.324]  Reports from earlier about Black Lives Matter attacking a woman and the police standing down.
[03:54:23.364 --> 03:54:27.204]  That was someone that Alex Jones talked to, a lady, very small, with a cane.
[03:54:27.545 --> 03:54:29.385]  She was attacked, knocked down, kicked in the chest.
[03:54:29.885 --> 03:54:32.245]  She said the police stood by, but reporters helped her.
[03:54:32.265 --> 03:54:34.806]  But I was talking before we went to break, Leanne, about
[03:54:35.900 --> 03:54:40.587]  Hillary Clinton, and as she was introduced, you can see this picture, she doesn't look very happy.
[03:54:41.007 --> 03:54:41.728]  Neither does Bill.
[03:54:42.990 --> 03:54:46.374]  Trump supporters are chanting, lock her up when Hillary Clinton is announced.
[03:54:46.635 --> 03:54:50.380]  You had some comments about her body language and what we saw.
[03:54:50.720 --> 03:54:57.546]  If you could see, the right side broadcasting had a great angle on her during their coverage of the inauguration.
[03:54:57.586 --> 03:55:02.951]  And so she was standing right behind Michelle Obama and to the back.
[03:55:03.111 --> 03:55:10.017]  But all of these people who typically would come to kiss the ring with Hillary Clinton, they were almost snubbing her.
[03:55:10.197 --> 03:55:12.339]  Or they'd just give her a little, hey, nice to see you.
[03:55:12.679 --> 03:55:15.041]  But she had no power, first of all.
[03:55:15.302 --> 03:55:16.503]  She hasn't been pardoned.
[03:55:17.023 --> 03:55:22.769]  Secondly, so you could tell that everyone was being a little bit icy toward the Clintons.
[03:55:23.410 --> 03:55:27.974]  And they were just sitting there with this sort of look of, ooh, we don't belong here anymore.
[03:55:28.054 --> 03:55:28.815]  We don't fit in here.
[03:55:28.875 --> 03:55:30.196]  We're getting snubbed left and right.
[03:55:30.236 --> 03:55:32.659]  And she was trying to be gracious, trying not to cry.
[03:55:32.679 --> 03:55:38.585]  But it wasn't, you could also tell there was this real icy vibe in the air as well.
[03:55:38.925 --> 03:55:45.090]  So what do you think, Darren and Margaret, do you think that the Justice Department or the FBI will continue their investigation of the Clinton Foundation?
[03:55:45.150 --> 03:55:48.073]  Do you think they'll do something about it, or is she too big to jail?
[03:55:48.934 --> 03:55:49.775]  That's a good question.
[03:55:50.035 --> 03:55:58.963]  You know, one of the things Trump has to do is drain the swamp in Washington, but he also has to drain the swamp in the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:55:59.003 --> 03:56:03.927]  All the intelligence communities, the swamp needs to be drained, so it remains to be seen.
[03:56:04.187 --> 03:56:05.909]  I think that she is so delusional.
[03:56:05.989 --> 03:56:08.992]  She is probably plotting another presidential run.
[03:56:09.112 --> 03:56:11.855]  I mean, it is just, you know, incessant with her.
[03:56:11.895 --> 03:56:14.397]  We saw them shut down the Clinton Global Foundation.
[03:56:14.757 --> 03:56:24.547]  They know that there has been not only conflict of interest, collusion, but illegal activity in terms of taking money from foreign governments to try to influence policy.
[03:56:24.567 --> 03:56:25.568]  It's a big no-no.
[03:56:25.948 --> 03:56:27.829]  And it's up to Jeff Sessions.
[03:56:27.910 --> 03:56:28.950]  It's up to the DOJ.
[03:56:29.130 --> 03:56:30.812]  It was a campaign promise by Trump.
[03:56:30.852 --> 03:56:32.013]  I think he will pursue it.
[03:56:32.333 --> 03:56:35.855]  And if, you know, if justice is served, she will be behind bars.
[03:56:36.036 --> 03:56:37.497]  It was time for the country to heal.
[03:56:37.557 --> 03:56:38.998]  You know, he did come out with this message.
[03:56:39.018 --> 03:56:43.701]  He was asked in that 60 Minutes interview, I believe, about this with Leslie Stahl.
[03:56:43.721 --> 03:56:46.183]  And he did indicate that he was not going to do that.
[03:56:47.844 --> 03:56:48.565]  Exactly.
[03:56:48.585 --> 03:56:49.245]  He doesn't have to.
[03:56:49.545 --> 03:56:52.007]  Hey, we're talking about body language at the inauguration.
[03:56:52.487 --> 03:56:56.110]  You should have seen Bill Clinton's body language when he was looking at the First Lady.
[03:56:56.770 --> 03:56:57.110]  Really?
[03:56:57.130 --> 03:56:58.091]  Oh, I missed that.
[03:56:58.111 --> 03:57:01.954]  And it looked like Hillary looked at him like, oh my God, you're not doing this right now, are you?
[03:57:01.974 --> 03:57:03.475]  She's got to get a leash for him.
[03:57:03.675 --> 03:57:06.036]  I mean, this is just... He was.
[03:57:06.116 --> 03:57:06.677]  I missed this.
[03:57:06.957 --> 03:57:10.999]  We need to dig that up for you and replay this, actually.
[03:57:11.019 --> 03:57:11.920]  It would be a good replay.
[03:57:11.960 --> 03:57:17.324]  Hey guys, we just got word that at the University of Texas right now there's hundreds of people doing a walkout.
[03:57:17.344 --> 03:57:19.045]  They're walking out, they're getting ready for it.
[03:57:19.065 --> 03:57:20.626]  We just had it on our screen a moment ago.
[03:57:20.867 --> 03:57:24.729]  They're getting ready for a protest that's taking place in Austin.
[03:57:24.769 --> 03:57:25.910]  I believe downtown Austin.
[03:57:25.930 --> 03:57:26.411]  There it is.
[03:57:27.071 --> 03:57:30.534]  One resistance rally and protest on Trump's inauguration today at 5 o'clock.
[03:57:30.554 --> 03:57:33.856]  Ashley Baxter is going to... They're walking out of their political science class.
[03:57:33.876 --> 03:57:34.517]  How disturbing.
[03:57:34.597 --> 03:57:37.759]  And I promise you the teachers and faculty are going with them.
[03:57:37.959 --> 03:57:40.201]  And they want to shut it down during rush hour traffic.
[03:57:40.521 --> 03:57:44.682]  I guarantee you the people who are going there for engineering degrees aren't walking out or they'll be not coming back.
[03:57:44.802 --> 03:57:45.523]  All right, stay with us.
[03:57:45.543 --> 03:57:49.244]  We're going to be right back with more of our live coverage of the Trump inauguration.
[03:57:49.284 --> 03:57:51.045]  We'll be right back.
[03:57:53.265 --> 03:57:56.666]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:57:56.686 --> 03:57:58.747]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:02.927 --> 03:58:09.092]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:58:09.473 --> 03:58:12.355]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:58:12.635 --> 03:58:17.900]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:58:18.320 --> 03:58:24.285]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:58:24.425 --> 03:58:27.568]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:58:27.708 --> 03:58:29.149]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:58:29.349 --> 03:58:33.513]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:58:33.693 --> 03:58:36.555]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:58:36.635 --> 03:58:38.217]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:58:38.297 --> 03:58:41.480]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:58:41.780 --> 03:58:44.102]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:58:44.382 --> 03:58:45.343]  It's in powder form.
[03:58:45.443 --> 03:58:48.145]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:58:48.326 --> 03:58:48.926]  I take this.
[03:58:49.026 --> 03:58:50.728]  This is the product that I take.
[03:58:50.848 --> 03:58:52.810]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[03:58:53.630 --> 03:58:54.391]  We fight the Globals.
[03:58:54.431 --> 03:58:55.312]  We fight the New World Order.
[03:58:55.572 --> 03:59:01.878]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:59:04.160 --> 03:59:08.264]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:59:08.784 --> 03:59:10.066]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:59:20.461 --> 03:59:25.725]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:59:26.606 --> 03:59:29.548]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:59:35.212 --> 03:59:36.293]  Everyone, please stand.
[03:59:54.864 --> 03:59:57.966]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[03:59:59.107 --> 04:00:01.769]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[04:00:02.609 --> 04:00:05.591]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[04:00:05.991 --> 04:00:08.033]  That I will faithfully execute.
[04:00:08.673 --> 04:00:10.895]  That I will faithfully execute.
[04:00:11.075 --> 04:00:13.797]  The office of President of the United States.
[04:00:14.157 --> 04:00:17.099]  The office of President of the United States.
[04:00:17.519 --> 04:00:19.460]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[04:00:19.981 --> 04:00:22.182]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[04:00:22.542 --> 04:00:24.524]  Preserve, protect, and defend.
[04:00:25.024 --> 04:00:29.093]  Preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[04:00:29.213 --> 04:00:31.578]  The Constitution of the United States.
[04:00:31.738 --> 04:00:32.560]  So help me God.
[04:00:32.800 --> 04:00:33.642]  So help me God.
[04:00:34.163 --> 04:00:35.426]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[04:01:43.846 --> 04:01:54.191]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[04:02:20.373 --> 04:02:34.938]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[04:02:40.689 --> 04:02:54.376]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[04:02:56.497 --> 04:03:03.260]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[04:03:05.891 --> 04:03:07.492]  We will face challenges.
[04:03:08.112 --> 04:03:09.773]  We will confront hardships.
[04:03:10.393 --> 04:03:12.454]  But we will get the job done.
[04:03:13.874 --> 04:03:20.077]  Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[04:03:21.235 --> 04:03:31.962]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[04:03:32.642 --> 04:03:34.943]  They have been magnificent.
[04:03:35.264 --> 04:03:35.644]  Thank you.
[04:03:43.168 --> 04:03:47.492]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[04:03:48.393 --> 04:03:56.781]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another.
[04:03:57.461 --> 04:04:05.249]  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.
[04:04:15.084 --> 04:04:18.286]  James O'Keefe, of course, as you know, is president of Project Veritas.
[04:04:18.306 --> 04:04:28.410]  He's well known for his 2009 ACORN investigation, the systematic corruption that he discovered and showed in multiple offices that ultimately forced that group to disband.
[04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:31.412]  Tell us a little bit about part one that we saw yesterday.
[04:04:31.432 --> 04:04:33.633]  Of course, what they were talking about doing was releasing
[04:04:34.273 --> 04:04:40.278]  Butyric acid in the deporbal, and that is the thing that gives human vomit its smell.
[04:04:40.358 --> 04:04:42.560]  It's a very disgusting, intolerable smell.
[04:04:42.580 --> 04:04:43.420]  It makes people sick.
[04:04:43.440 --> 04:04:44.081]  They want to do that.
[04:04:44.181 --> 04:04:48.565]  But, in concentration, it is an acid, and so it'll burn your skin, it'll burn your lungs.
[04:04:49.005 --> 04:04:50.086]  It's a very dangerous thing.
[04:04:50.166 --> 04:04:53.889]  That's a criminal conspiracy, isn't it, James?
[04:04:54.449 --> 04:04:56.410]  Yeah, it's actually covered under the D.C.
[04:04:56.970 --> 04:04:58.551]  anti-terrorism statutes.
[04:04:59.492 --> 04:05:01.613]  And it's not just a prank.
[04:05:01.653 --> 04:05:09.837]  This acid could, it's a flammable material, it could burn your lungs, it could cause a stampede out of the National Press Club, people trampling one another.
[04:05:09.857 --> 04:05:12.398]  It's considered terrorism.
[04:05:12.598 --> 04:05:14.519]  And we took the footage to the FBI.
[04:05:15.020 --> 04:05:19.342]  They had the video, they had these people's names and numbers, they had their last names.
[04:05:19.822 --> 04:05:24.265]  When we took this footage to them, they thanked us and said they were going to be launching an investigation.
[04:05:24.886 --> 04:05:28.128]  And they also said they wanted to set off the sprinkler systems and get people wet.
[04:05:28.609 --> 04:05:29.910]  It's going to be cold outside.
[04:05:29.930 --> 04:05:33.953]  They want to do as much harm physically to people as possible.
[04:05:34.033 --> 04:05:35.274]  If people have a right,
[04:05:35.974 --> 04:05:37.715]  ...to exercise their free speech.
[04:05:37.735 --> 04:05:44.338]  And I think that the protests, in terms of standing there with a sign, talking about something, I think we're actually too restrictive on that in the U.S.
[04:05:44.358 --> 04:05:49.180]  because you look at these political conventions, what they do is they have protesters at both the political conventions.
[04:05:49.200 --> 04:05:52.101]  They put them far away from where the political convention is.
[04:05:52.141 --> 04:05:55.683]  In most cases, the last several elections, they put them in cages.
[04:05:56.183 --> 04:05:57.544]  You have to have a permit ahead of time.
[04:05:57.604 --> 04:06:00.325]  But we're not talking about that kind of free speech here.
[04:06:00.785 --> 04:06:10.471]  We're talking about people who are being paid to agitate, and we have seen this in the run-up to the election, that they get violent with people, that they instigate violence.
[04:06:10.511 --> 04:06:16.034]  And then, of course, that violence is blamed on Donald Trump or on Trump supporters and not on the people who go there as paid agitators.
[04:06:16.194 --> 04:06:20.136]  And they're trying to do something that is very dangerous to people.
[04:06:20.176 --> 04:06:20.957]  It ought to be a crime.
[04:06:21.597 --> 04:06:22.378]  Yeah, it is a crime.
[04:06:22.418 --> 04:06:24.700]  It's considered under the anti-terrorism statute.
[04:06:25.020 --> 04:06:32.426]  You have the statute up in front of you there, but it's punishable by a five-year prison sentence and significant fine.
[04:06:32.446 --> 04:06:34.948]  They're also going to try to shut down the railroads.
[04:06:35.489 --> 04:06:38.552]  They're going to try to disrupt public transportation.
[04:06:38.692 --> 04:06:43.275]  And by the way, it's kind of ironic that the anti-fascists are planning on gassing people.
[04:06:44.096 --> 04:06:49.160]  I mean, I hate to make a joke, but in the HVAC system, it's just bizarre.
[04:06:49.420 --> 04:06:56.266]  Their narrative is to pretend that there's going to be some kind of spontaneous conflict, and who started it?
[04:06:56.306 --> 04:06:57.106]  Did that side start it?
[04:06:57.146 --> 04:06:58.007]  Did the other side start it?
[04:06:58.327 --> 04:07:10.337]  If you show that they've been premeditating this type of activity, then that kind of destroys their whole narrative that, oh, it was the Trump supporters who started this, and we were just there innocently standing by.
[04:07:23.280 --> 04:07:26.181]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[04:07:26.201 --> 04:07:35.406]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[04:07:35.466 --> 04:07:36.666]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[04:07:37.186 --> 04:07:41.028]  Leanne McAdoo is here with me in the studio and in the other studio we have Darren McBreen and Margaret Howell.
[04:07:41.048 --> 04:07:44.089]  We're going to be going to Owen Schroyer in Washington, D.C.
[04:07:44.130 --> 04:07:44.690]  in just a moment.
[04:07:45.595 --> 04:07:47.136]  Trump is my president.
[04:07:47.596 --> 04:07:48.496]  Deal with it, folks!
[04:07:50.137 --> 04:07:51.277]  That's the next shirt.
[04:07:51.678 --> 04:07:52.138]  That's right.
[04:07:52.178 --> 04:07:55.039]  And so we have a shirt that says that.
[04:07:55.119 --> 04:07:56.139]  Trump is my president.
[04:07:56.220 --> 04:07:57.320]  And we have that on sale.
[04:07:57.340 --> 04:07:59.341]  It's a limited edition collector's item.
[04:08:00.001 --> 04:08:08.545]  And it's something that, you know, just wear those and help all these snowflakes to kind of break into the notion that yes, Trump is my president.
[04:08:08.585 --> 04:08:09.805]  He's your president now, too.
[04:08:09.825 --> 04:08:10.846]  Put that on the back.
[04:08:10.966 --> 04:08:11.466]  Yours, too!
[04:08:12.006 --> 04:08:18.811]  We didn't like having Obama as our president, but we dealt with it for eight years, and now they're going to have to deal with Trump as president.
[04:08:18.831 --> 04:08:21.073]  So you can get that for $9.95 at Infowarsstore.com.
[04:08:21.373 --> 04:08:28.098]  Also, you know, he was talking about it's not which party controls the government, but whether or not government is controlled by the people.
[04:08:28.138 --> 04:08:30.560]  That was from Donald Trump's excellent speech.
[04:08:30.600 --> 04:08:32.081]  I thought he made some great points there.
[04:08:32.811 --> 04:08:39.000]  If you believe that, if you think that America is going to be free again, or you want America to be free again, make America free again.
[04:08:39.060 --> 04:08:43.927]  Our cap is also available at Infowars.com and also the President Trump lithograph.
[04:08:43.967 --> 04:08:47.332]  It's 16 by 20, it's limited edition, it's done by the same artist.
[04:08:47.853 --> 04:08:49.955]  They did the classic Ronald Reagan portrait.
[04:08:49.975 --> 04:08:53.818]  He's the RNC portrait artist, the official RNC portrait artist.
[04:08:54.179 --> 04:09:00.664]  If you've seen that picture of Ronald Reagan with the cowboy hat on, this is the same artist that did that.
[04:09:00.684 --> 04:09:02.806]  It's a very detailed, beautiful portrait.
[04:09:03.267 --> 04:09:06.629]  It's 16 by 20 and it's a limited edition, available only at Infowarsstore.com.
[04:09:06.649 --> 04:09:07.310]  1995, the President Trump portrait.
[04:09:11.954 --> 04:09:21.679]  And also our sale that we have that we began at the beginning of the year, 20 to 30% off InfoWars Life products, some of our best sellers on sale.
[04:09:22.259 --> 04:09:26.341]  That is going to be ending soon with this inauguration, but that is still available.
[04:09:26.361 --> 04:09:34.705]  So go to InfoWarsLife.com, take a look at some of the best sellers that we've now put on sale, anywhere from 20 to 30% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[04:09:34.885 --> 04:09:40.468]  All right, joining us now is Owen Schroer, one of our reporters in Washington, D.C.
[04:09:42.546 --> 04:09:43.529]  What's going on, David?
[04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:47.078]  I, uh, just left one of the, uh, crew bases to head back out.
[04:09:47.720 --> 04:09:49.384]  And, uh, there's not too much action out here.
[04:09:49.424 --> 04:09:51.370]  I think most of it has moved towards the White House.
[04:09:51.834 --> 04:09:53.075]  I'm trying to get to the Washington Monument.
[04:09:53.095 --> 04:09:54.136]  Is this the best way to go through here?
[04:10:15.797 --> 04:10:18.405]  Uh, why they need the safety, but I mean, my God, can I use a road?
[04:10:18.425 --> 04:10:21.674]  It's like, I have to, I have to walk through a maze.
[04:10:22.235 --> 04:10:24.121]  It takes two hours to go two blocks.
[04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:26.050]  Oh yeah.
[04:10:26.111 --> 04:10:29.532]  And then you've got protesters trying to make it even more inconvenient for you.
[04:10:29.892 --> 04:10:41.016]  I'm telling you, Owen, when we covered the Pope's visit and we went to Washington, New York and Philadelphia, Philadelphia was way worse than the other two cities who are used to dealing with this sort of thing all the time.
[04:10:41.036 --> 04:10:48.838]  But of course, one of the reasons that you're seeing so much security here is because of all the threats that we were told, hey, we're just joking, we're not really going to do that.
[04:10:48.878 --> 04:10:50.699]  And yet they are getting violent with people.
[04:10:51.079 --> 04:10:58.240]  Well, and one thing I think that they're trying to sell right now is that Donald Trump didn't have a big inauguration, that there weren't that many people there.
[04:10:58.780 --> 04:11:02.841]  Well, there were protesters blocking the gates, okay?
[04:11:03.261 --> 04:11:04.822]  They were intentionally blocking the gates.
[04:11:04.842 --> 04:11:06.402]  So they're going to run with this false narrative.
[04:11:06.682 --> 04:11:09.282]  We caught videos of the protesters blocking the gates.
[04:11:09.642 --> 04:11:11.963]  They claim, oh, I'm just in line, I'm just in line.
[04:11:12.243 --> 04:11:13.883]  But come on, we know what you're doing.
[04:11:13.943 --> 04:11:14.803]  We know what your plans were.
[04:11:15.384 --> 04:11:16.664]  And I guess they were effective.
[04:11:16.784 --> 04:11:17.144]  I don't know.
[04:11:17.184 --> 04:11:17.644]  It was tough.
[04:11:18.627 --> 04:11:23.334]  I mean, there were, I saw 20,000 people waiting to get in and that couldn't even get in.
[04:11:23.414 --> 04:11:25.096]  I could never even see what went on inside.
[04:11:25.136 --> 04:11:26.418]  I saw some, hey, how you doing guys?
[04:11:26.438 --> 04:11:27.159]  Thanks for the support.
[04:11:27.600 --> 04:11:29.142]  Oh, by the way, we get so much love out here.
[04:11:29.222 --> 04:11:29.803]  It's ridiculous.
[04:11:30.424 --> 04:11:31.445]  Yeah, we were saying that.
[04:11:32.246 --> 04:11:34.409]  They say that they're occupying DC.
[04:11:34.569 --> 04:11:35.671]  No, we have occupied DC.
[04:11:36.343 --> 04:11:38.245]  Right, well that's why you have the D.C.
[04:11:38.305 --> 04:11:41.527]  establishment saying they felt like their town was being invaded.
[04:11:41.547 --> 04:11:42.488]  Yeah, invaded with patriots.
[04:11:42.508 --> 04:11:44.449]  Your days are numbered.
[04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:45.450]  Yeah, they don't know what to do.
[04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:46.210]  Right.
[04:11:46.270 --> 04:11:46.991]  They don't know what to do.
[04:11:47.291 --> 04:11:49.253]  You should have seen them at the Deplora Ball last night.
[04:11:49.293 --> 04:11:54.937]  They were out in the streets running around with their faces covered, throwing objects, trying to intimidate and bully people.
[04:11:55.517 --> 04:11:56.338]  It's ridiculous.
[04:11:57.138 --> 04:12:01.882]  But nobody got into the Deplora Ball and created anything on the inside, is that correct?
[04:12:02.958 --> 04:12:04.839]  No, no, I did not see anything on the inside.
[04:12:05.639 --> 04:12:06.359]  It was a good time.
[04:12:07.259 --> 04:12:12.181]  Sheriff David Clark gave an absolutely rousing speech that got the house, I thought the place was going to come down.
[04:12:12.841 --> 04:12:13.621]  So that was cool.
[04:12:13.841 --> 04:12:15.022]  But no, everything inside was good.
[04:12:15.042 --> 04:12:20.003]  And actually, there was a line of police in front of the entrance to the press square.
[04:12:20.443 --> 04:12:26.745]  And I'm out front, I think the video may be on the Alex Jones Show on YouTube, but I'm out front and I'm talking to some of the protesters.
[04:12:26.765 --> 04:12:27.746]  They keep saying my name.
[04:12:27.766 --> 04:12:28.786]  They're trying to intimidate me.
[04:12:28.826 --> 04:12:29.106]  So I'm like,
[04:12:29.646 --> 04:12:30.507]  Oh, you know who I am.
[04:12:30.567 --> 04:12:31.367]  Like, why don't we talk?
[04:12:31.767 --> 04:12:32.727]  They keep hiding their faces.
[04:12:33.128 --> 04:12:37.149]  And then the police basically grabbed me and pulled and said, stop it and go inside.
[04:12:37.509 --> 04:12:41.351]  So they were trying to quell some of that from our side, too.
[04:12:41.451 --> 04:12:43.692]  But inside the event, there was no issues.
[04:12:44.132 --> 04:12:45.133]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[04:12:45.833 --> 04:12:46.373]  Very interesting.
[04:12:46.433 --> 04:12:51.916]  Of course, this is Owen Troyer, and that's video from last night, I guess, that we've got up there.
[04:12:51.936 --> 04:12:52.936]  Is that correct, guys?
[04:12:53.116 --> 04:12:54.857]  Yeah, that's the video.
[04:12:55.472 --> 04:12:58.455]  Yeah, that's a video that I believe I shot last night outside of the DePore Ball.
[04:12:58.475 --> 04:13:02.118]  Yeah, we saw someone bleeding from the back of their head after they got hit with the flagpole.
[04:13:02.138 --> 04:13:03.940]  They were pelting people with eggs.
[04:13:04.640 --> 04:13:06.562]  One of them tried to hit me with a flagpole.
[04:13:06.782 --> 04:13:10.305]  There was a grandma who came running out with her little grandchild crying.
[04:13:10.486 --> 04:13:12.167]  It was one of the worst sights you could ever see.
[04:13:12.187 --> 04:13:15.070]  From those peaceful protesters?
[04:13:15.922 --> 04:13:18.423]  Yeah, when they go low, they really go low, don't they?
[04:13:18.443 --> 04:13:19.943]  I mean, they just go low.
[04:13:20.123 --> 04:13:22.563]  I think Madonna actually called out for that.
[04:13:22.603 --> 04:13:29.185]  She said, we need to go as low as we can go, which is pretty darn low for her.
[04:13:29.205 --> 04:13:37.046]  I actually heard that Bill Clinton was going to vote for Donald Trump until he heard that Madonna was offering fellatio, and then he switched his vote to Hillary.
[04:13:37.567 --> 04:13:40.347]  So I don't know, that's just a little intel that I got on the side out here.
[04:13:40.367 --> 04:13:44.168]  But no, I'm heading towards where I think more of the action is going to be
[04:13:44.949 --> 04:13:49.074]  I don't know if you guys are in touch with the other crew, but apparently there were some explosions.
[04:13:49.174 --> 04:13:49.915]  Oh, I need to go off the show.
[04:13:49.935 --> 04:13:53.239]  There were some explosions up at K and 21st Street.
[04:13:53.840 --> 04:13:55.101]  Kit Daniels was on the scene.
[04:13:55.121 --> 04:14:02.451]  He said that there were protesters burning things, burning newsstands, basically rioting going on.
[04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:05.171]  So I know that he's going to have footage of that.
[04:14:05.552 --> 04:14:12.820]  I'm going to come up from the south and come up from the Washington Monument because I've heard that there might be some action there as well and then make my way up north.
[04:14:13.160 --> 04:14:14.121]  How you guys like InfoWars?
[04:14:14.301 --> 04:14:14.582]  Yes!
[04:14:14.842 --> 04:14:15.102]  Awesome.
[04:14:15.122 --> 04:14:15.823]  We're live right now.
[04:14:15.843 --> 04:14:17.205]  Say hi to the audience.
[04:14:19.386 --> 04:14:31.814]  Well, of course, Owen, we were airing some of the live shots that I think Time Magazine had some live feed of some of that, and some fires that were being set, and as we're doing that, we've got people saying, that was last night, that's not today, or that was earlier this morning.
[04:14:32.635 --> 04:14:37.378]  There's a lot of stuff that's going on there, and I think it just underscores the fact
[04:14:38.098 --> 04:14:38.238]  Well...
[04:14:56.340 --> 04:14:58.220]  And we've absolutely proved that in spades.
[04:14:58.360 --> 04:15:03.621]  And they don't, like you said, they don't want to take place with the democracy that we're running, the political process.
[04:15:03.962 --> 04:15:05.562]  And they don't want to engage in conversation.
[04:15:05.862 --> 04:15:07.762]  They just want to come out here and whine and cry.
[04:15:07.962 --> 04:15:08.342]  That's it.
[04:15:08.722 --> 04:15:09.063]  That's it.
[04:15:09.163 --> 04:15:10.143]  They have done nothing else.
[04:15:10.203 --> 04:15:13.863]  And I've got about five more videos that I'm going to upload later that are going to prove the same thing.
[04:15:14.244 --> 04:15:16.364]  I got called a white male again five times.
[04:15:16.764 --> 04:15:17.884]  I know I'm a white male.
[04:15:18.024 --> 04:15:19.185]  Like, I have a mirror.
[04:15:19.305 --> 04:15:20.405]  Ridiculous.
[04:15:20.505 --> 04:15:21.125]  I have a mirror.
[04:15:22.136 --> 04:15:24.139]  I don't know.
[04:15:24.419 --> 04:15:26.301]  Some dysphoria there.
[04:15:26.502 --> 04:15:38.436]  The chip on her shoulder Megyn Kelly reporter who moved to another network after they replaced her with a white male, we now have, he is now killing the ratings in her time spot there.
[04:15:38.536 --> 04:15:39.598]  Of course he is.
[04:15:39.938 --> 04:15:41.979]  Yeah, Hannity, here's the future of Fox News.
[04:15:42.279 --> 04:15:48.080]  Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and if Bill O'Reilly comes around, he might stick around and continue to be a big thing too.
[04:15:48.120 --> 04:15:51.901]  But, yeah, the Megyn Kellys of the world, the Shills of the world, they're done.
[04:15:52.001 --> 04:15:52.961]  CNN is done.
[04:15:53.001 --> 04:15:53.941]  CNN is fake news.
[04:15:54.162 --> 04:15:55.662]  They're hiding on top of a building.
[04:15:55.722 --> 04:15:56.102]  You know that?
[04:15:56.162 --> 04:15:57.342]  You know they're on top of a building?
[04:15:57.682 --> 04:16:04.984]  Because they can't have people walking around behind them, calling them fake news, showing that Trump is really, all the Trump supporters are out here, not the protesters.
[04:16:05.004 --> 04:16:07.065]  So, hold on guys, let me look into the clouds.
[04:16:07.145 --> 04:16:07.945]  Is CNN up there?
[04:16:10.265 --> 04:16:20.948]  Well, we have had reports that a YMCA in California said we're going to take off CNN off of our screens here in the gym because they are fake news and then people started screaming censorship.
[04:16:21.168 --> 04:16:34.170]  Look, the people who want censorship are the people who are in Hollywood, who are essentially pushing their neo-McCarthyism, their neo-Cold War, their political correctness, which is nothing but censorship and blacklists, and they ought to be ashamed of that.
[04:16:34.450 --> 04:16:35.791]  And we're going to call them out for that.
[04:16:36.571 --> 04:16:37.951]  And the thing about that is, too,
[04:16:38.983 --> 04:16:46.366]  See, CNN knows that most people that watch CNN or whatever, Fox News knows this too, that they're probably just reading the bottom line.
[04:16:46.386 --> 04:16:47.926]  They're probably just reading the headlines.
[04:16:48.186 --> 04:16:49.227]  They're not actually listening.
[04:16:49.487 --> 04:16:51.087]  They're probably seeing it at the gym.
[04:16:51.508 --> 04:17:00.491]  So that's why they push these bottom lines and these headlines that are so extreme, so that people see that and then they take that literally while they're on the elliptical at the gym.
[04:17:00.851 --> 04:17:03.072]  Well look what they did with the bottom line on Alex Jones.
[04:17:03.112 --> 04:17:06.213]  They put there Alex Jones and put KKK leader or whatever.
[04:17:06.233 --> 04:17:07.474]  Remember that lower third?
[04:17:07.634 --> 04:17:10.876]  So if you're in the gym and you see that and you don't have any sound, that's what you see there.
[04:17:10.956 --> 04:17:13.417]  Alex Jones is now a KKK leader.
[04:17:13.457 --> 04:17:22.981]  That's the way they deceive people and that's probably one of the reasons that type of reporting is probably why the YMCA wisely chose to delete them off the screen.
[04:17:23.461 --> 04:17:28.624]  The next thing the YMCA needs to do, and I've told them this before, I've been a YMCA member for a long time.
[04:17:29.244 --> 04:17:29.764]  Proud of that.
[04:17:30.225 --> 04:17:32.827]  But they need to get fluoride out of their drinking fountains.
[04:17:32.847 --> 04:17:34.608]  That's the next big revolution the Y can start.
[04:17:34.648 --> 04:17:39.691]  So you start something here, you take CNN off the TV, and then you take the fluoride out of the water.
[04:17:39.732 --> 04:17:40.172]  What do you know?
[04:17:40.212 --> 04:17:41.773]  You're the biggest patriots in the gym industry.
[04:17:41.793 --> 04:17:42.533]  All right.
[04:17:42.574 --> 04:17:43.774]  Well, thank you, Owen.
[04:17:43.814 --> 04:17:46.276]  Keep going and let us know if you see anything there.
[04:17:46.376 --> 04:17:49.038]  As we know, there are events that are happening there.
[04:17:49.058 --> 04:17:51.100]  They're beginning the parade pretty soon.
[04:17:51.140 --> 04:17:54.242]  I want to go to... Yeah, we'll be live all night, so call in when you can.
[04:17:54.582 --> 04:17:54.942]  That's right.
[04:17:55.182 --> 04:17:55.623]  Thank you, Owen.
[04:17:55.763 --> 04:17:59.106]  That's Owen Shore, our reporter in Washington, D.C.
[04:18:00.006 --> 04:18:01.147]  On the road, walking.
[04:18:02.168 --> 04:18:08.413]  Everywhere, because I tell you what, when you go to these places, when we were in Philadelphia, as he pointed out, you just can't get anywhere.
[04:18:08.433 --> 04:18:12.777]  I mean, they blocked everything off, and we could only go a couple of feet, and then they blocked that off.
[04:18:12.817 --> 04:18:19.702]  We arrived on the train, and they had shut down any access to taxis or anything, and we walked.
[04:18:19.722 --> 04:18:24.106]  I think it's about two hours with all of our luggage and equipment to walk to our
[04:18:24.586 --> 04:18:27.247]  Our hotel, it was absolutely crazy and that was just for the Pope.
[04:18:27.307 --> 04:18:29.907]  I mean it wasn't, nobody was threatening the Pope.
[04:18:30.207 --> 04:18:30.568]  Yeah.
[04:18:30.588 --> 04:18:35.089]  Nobody was saying they were going to throw excrement at the Pope or anything and they did all of that.
[04:18:35.109 --> 04:18:39.650]  Well and DC isn't a very large city or state.
[04:18:39.970 --> 04:18:40.150]  Yeah.
[04:18:40.430 --> 04:18:42.051]  It's kind of both, it's a district.
[04:18:42.091 --> 04:18:42.951]  Yeah, it's a district.
[04:18:44.211 --> 04:18:46.252]  It isn't a safe, but it is a whole separate thing.
[04:18:46.292 --> 04:18:57.994]  It's small, but that's why it was so effective for them to shut down with just blockading the DC Metro and then these checkpoints, because it's so hard to get around.
[04:18:58.234 --> 04:18:59.815]  Everyone has to be funneled through these checkpoints.
[04:18:59.835 --> 04:19:06.016]  We've got a lot of people packed in one little small area there, and those people are very concerned that they're going to lose their special privilege.
[04:19:06.096 --> 04:19:09.037]  One of the wealthiest places on earth, the District of Criminals.
[04:19:09.057 --> 04:19:10.377]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[04:19:13.322 --> 04:19:18.125]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[04:19:18.285 --> 04:19:25.348]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[04:19:25.589 --> 04:19:28.010]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[04:19:28.450 --> 04:19:30.012]  And I started to try to eat healthy.
[04:19:30.212 --> 04:19:31.853]  Started taking third party supplements.
[04:19:32.254 --> 04:19:34.076]  Started seeing some more gains.
[04:19:34.596 --> 04:19:45.026]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[04:19:45.147 --> 04:19:45.427]  Boom!
[04:19:45.827 --> 04:19:47.269]  Weight started pouring off.
[04:19:47.369 --> 04:19:49.271]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[04:19:49.731 --> 04:19:50.892]  Then, by early 2016,
[04:19:52.954 --> 04:19:56.296]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[04:19:56.316 --> 04:19:57.397]  But the election heated up.
[04:19:57.437 --> 04:19:59.798]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[04:19:59.938 --> 04:20:09.163]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[04:20:09.403 --> 04:20:10.344]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[04:20:10.544 --> 04:20:14.206]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[04:20:15.026 --> 04:20:21.092]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[04:20:21.132 --> 04:20:22.453]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[04:20:22.533 --> 04:20:26.057]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[04:20:27.915 --> 04:20:34.717]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[04:20:35.057 --> 04:20:41.540]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[04:20:41.940 --> 04:20:42.460]  It's amazing.
[04:20:42.760 --> 04:20:45.121]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[04:20:45.421 --> 04:20:48.062]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[04:20:51.803 --> 04:20:52.424]  Well, here we are.
[04:20:52.464 --> 04:20:53.545]  Another week has passed.
[04:20:54.146 --> 04:21:06.239]  If memory serves, I lost 5 pounds the first week, 3 pounds the next, and only 1 pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[04:21:06.279 --> 04:21:08.221]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[04:21:08.681 --> 04:21:09.602]  I've lost a pound.
[04:21:10.123 --> 04:21:11.044]  So we're now up to 9 pounds.
[04:21:12.631 --> 04:21:16.814]  And I've only got, you know, a week and a half left or so until we see what happens in this experiment.
[04:21:16.834 --> 04:21:18.455]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[04:21:18.475 --> 04:21:20.557]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[04:21:21.397 --> 04:21:26.080]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[04:21:26.621 --> 04:21:29.083]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[04:21:29.203 --> 04:21:30.744]  Let's see what happens next week.
[04:21:34.721 --> 04:21:36.923]  Well, this is the final update on our little experiment.
[04:21:37.063 --> 04:21:41.806]  I started out in early December, and indeed, I pigged out over Christmas even more than usual.
[04:21:42.526 --> 04:21:47.030]  I did have better, more intense workouts because of Supermail, and just what it does to my mental picture.
[04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:58.778]  But taking the entire family of InfoWars live products, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Fruit Punch, Multivitamin, all of it with the amino acids, taking it all religiously every day, but once or twice.
[04:21:59.258 --> 04:22:01.820]  So I started in like, I don't know, December 3rd, 4th or so.
[04:22:02.020 --> 04:22:06.323]  Finished, what was it, about January 4th was the last day of the final photos I took just a few days ago.
[04:22:06.343 --> 04:22:08.745]  Then I left town for a few days, that's why this is a voice memo.
[04:22:09.065 --> 04:22:11.026]  I didn't shoot the final, final video.
[04:22:11.186 --> 04:22:13.748]  But what I'm getting at is, it really does work.
[04:22:14.028 --> 04:22:17.851]  Despite the fact that the day after Christmas, I ate almost an entire pie.
[04:22:18.211 --> 04:22:22.874]  My mother had brought over a pumpkin pie, and the day before that had three pieces of cherry pie.
[04:22:23.475 --> 04:22:26.096]  I'm not a big sweets person, but around the holidays, fudge,
[04:22:27.097 --> 04:22:28.439]  Well, you know how it is, folks.
[04:22:28.579 --> 04:22:35.568]  Hot cocoa, it's just, it's, since I was a kid, the only time I tend to eat a lot of sweets is, is maybe at birthday parties or around Christmas.
[04:22:35.628 --> 04:22:36.710]  And I just picked out this year.
[04:22:37.210 --> 04:22:38.752]  In fact, I was going to stop the experiment.
[04:22:38.772 --> 04:22:39.994]  I thought, well, this just isn't fair.
[04:22:40.034 --> 04:22:42.497]  I mean, I'm eating way more and working out less.
[04:22:43.438 --> 04:22:47.300]  This isn't going to happen, but we went ahead and did the experiment and I still lost some weight.
[04:22:47.940 --> 04:23:04.367]  It wasn't as much as I wanted to, but to me it proves the fact that again, metabolically, the things that God's given us through nature and having the good halogen and all the other things that are in the products in me helped me just lose weight while I was actually eating more.
[04:23:04.827 --> 04:23:05.547]  It's hard to believe.
[04:23:05.908 --> 04:23:08.289]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[04:23:08.569 --> 04:23:11.250]  Go read the five star reviews for yourself.
[04:23:13.720 --> 04:23:37.646]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[04:23:37.686 --> 04:23:39.126]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[04:23:39.166 --> 04:23:42.387]  We're going to be joining some of our crew who are live in Washington, D.C.
[04:23:43.297 --> 04:23:45.259]  Of course, Donald Trump is now President.
[04:23:45.499 --> 04:23:46.079]  Donald Trump.
[04:23:46.780 --> 04:23:50.323]  That happened at noon Eastern, and we've been playing you some of those clips.
[04:23:50.343 --> 04:23:55.387]  A great speech, talking about how this is not the transfer of power from one person to another.
[04:23:55.407 --> 04:23:57.949]  It's not the transfer of power from one party to another.
[04:23:57.969 --> 04:24:01.612]  It is transferring power back to the people.
[04:24:01.692 --> 04:24:07.057]  And of course, he referenced the people 45 times, about the same number of times that Barack Obama referenced himself.
[04:24:07.757 --> 04:24:09.718]  And his farewell address to the press.
[04:24:10.358 --> 04:24:12.239]  45 times Barack Obama talks about himself.
[04:24:12.559 --> 04:24:15.520]  Donald Trump, on becoming president, only talked about himself three times.
[04:24:15.560 --> 04:24:19.161]  But here's an interesting thing that just went up on the Drudge Report from Mark Moreno.
[04:24:19.641 --> 04:24:21.682]  We talked to him earlier this week, Climate Depot.
[04:24:22.222 --> 04:24:26.763]  All references to climate change have now been deleted from the White House website.
[04:24:27.064 --> 04:24:29.324]  That happened at noon today and he points it out and said, at 11.59 a.m.
[04:24:29.364 --> 04:24:29.524]  Eastern,
[04:24:31.425 --> 04:24:38.506]  The official White House website had a lengthy information page about the threat of climate change and the steps the federal government had taken to fight it.
[04:24:39.186 --> 04:24:47.708]  At noon, one minute later, at the instant Donald Trump took office, the page was gone, as well as any mention of climate change or global warming.
[04:24:48.768 --> 04:24:53.809]  Who will protect us from unicorn farts now that Barack Obama is gone?
[04:24:54.349 --> 04:24:56.710]  I mean, the UN has told us it's true, remember?
[04:24:56.730 --> 04:24:57.810]  The UN IPCC?
[04:24:59.246 --> 04:25:01.649]  The people who were at the center of Climategate.
[04:25:01.729 --> 04:25:03.912]  All of those rigged reports.
[04:25:03.952 --> 04:25:05.514]  They're passing notes back and forth.
[04:25:05.534 --> 04:25:07.636]  How are we going to hide the decline in temperatures?
[04:25:07.696 --> 04:25:09.639]  That's why they're talking about climate change.
[04:25:10.680 --> 04:25:13.063]  That's why they're talking about it instead of global warming.
[04:25:13.583 --> 04:25:14.965]  Instead of man-made global warming.
[04:25:15.546 --> 04:25:15.846]  Folks.
[04:25:16.587 --> 04:25:23.030]  This fiction is created as a massive power grab by the globalist government.
[04:25:23.070 --> 04:25:26.711]  They need a global crisis in order to seize power.
[04:25:27.252 --> 04:25:31.373]  In order to fund a global government, they need a global tax.
[04:25:32.254 --> 04:25:40.917]  And if you haven't figured it out yet, this is a massive crony capitalism, a massive transfer of wealth from one group of people to the other.
[04:25:41.017 --> 04:25:41.798]  That would be from you,
[04:25:42.719 --> 04:25:45.221]  To the few billionaires who run the world.
[04:25:45.241 --> 04:25:47.582]  And we just saw how that worked out in Davos.
[04:25:48.263 --> 04:25:53.987]  The 8 at the top that have as much money as half of the world's population at the bottom.
[04:25:54.707 --> 04:25:57.929]  And that's concentrated down from just 62 last year.
[04:25:58.890 --> 04:26:01.111]  That was bad enough, but now it's down to 8.
[04:26:01.171 --> 04:26:07.396]  And as Donald Trump pointed out in his acceptance speech, he said, their victories have not been your victories.
[04:26:07.436 --> 04:26:09.337]  Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[04:26:09.997 --> 04:26:10.638]  That changes.
[04:26:10.958 --> 04:26:12.179]  Right here, right now.
[04:26:13.505 --> 04:26:17.809]  That's why the establishment and both parties have tried to stop this.
[04:26:17.869 --> 04:26:26.816]  And I have to say to people, even though Donald Trump is not focused on civil liberties, like you would see from a President Rand Paul or whatever, a candidate Rand Paul.
[04:26:27.386 --> 04:26:40.915]  He's not focused on that, but you have to understand, if you're for individual liberty, you have got to reverse this trend of consolidation from the individual to the government, to the state, to the federal government, to the global government.
[04:26:41.276 --> 04:26:43.917]  You have to reverse this concentration of power.
[04:26:43.958 --> 04:26:45.679]  You have to stand there and say, that's enough.
[04:26:46.099 --> 04:26:47.000]  And that's what he's done.
[04:26:47.640 --> 04:26:49.621]  That's what the speech today was about.
[04:26:49.842 --> 04:26:54.585]  Very, very important to see this reversal as we're looking at this.
[04:26:54.685 --> 04:26:55.866]  And, you know, when I look at
[04:26:57.006 --> 04:27:05.733]  The protesters, and we're going to go back and talk to our reporters in Washington about this, but again, over and over again, we see that the left does not want to debate.
[04:27:06.634 --> 04:27:08.035]  They want to censor.
[04:27:08.095 --> 04:27:09.036]  They want to shut down.
[04:27:09.116 --> 04:27:11.958]  They want to black out what people are saying.
[04:27:12.879 --> 04:27:20.466]  If they wanted to participate in the voting process, these violent protesters, right after the election of Donald Trump, they would have registered to vote.
[04:27:20.486 --> 04:27:22.067]  They didn't even bother to register to vote.
[04:27:23.188 --> 04:27:25.430]  But they want to shut down your celebration.
[04:27:25.470 --> 04:27:26.691]  They want to shut down your victory.
[04:27:26.731 --> 04:27:30.193]  They want to shut down the movement of power back to the people.
[04:27:30.254 --> 04:27:33.956]  And it's quite obvious why they do not want to speak on camera.
[04:27:34.777 --> 04:27:39.801]  As we started out the broadcast this morning, we had Rob Dew offer one of them to talk.
[04:27:39.921 --> 04:27:46.486]  And the first guy that he handed the microphone to just came back with the racist, sexist, homophobic nonsense that we see.
[04:27:46.566 --> 04:27:52.331]  Just like we see Barbara Streisand coming out and saying, Trump is clueless, reckless, graceless, mindless, heartless.
[04:27:53.612 --> 04:27:57.034]  Barbara, you should talk less, because this is the Streisand effect.
[04:27:57.934 --> 04:28:03.957]  You are just making the case that you people don't want to have a dialogue.
[04:28:03.997 --> 04:28:05.857]  You don't have anything to offer us.
[04:28:07.078 --> 04:28:10.019]  And of course, Nancy Pelosi is going to continue down that same road.
[04:28:10.539 --> 04:28:16.062]  We've got Chuck Schumer saying, I'm going to block any Supreme Court justices that come out from Donald Trump, just because.
[04:28:16.322 --> 04:28:16.782]  Just because.
[04:28:17.162 --> 04:28:18.123]  We're going to obstruct this.
[04:28:19.144 --> 04:28:21.105]  These people want a Cold War.
[04:28:21.705 --> 04:28:27.786]  These Hollywood people, who all this time have been talking about they want peace and so forth, they want a Cold War.
[04:28:27.826 --> 04:28:29.187]  They want us to go to war with Russia.
[04:28:29.407 --> 04:28:36.029]  They want to get in now on the side of the military-industrial complex while they call everybody else fascists.
[04:28:36.829 --> 04:28:39.871]  They want to expand the number of wars from four to seven.
[04:28:40.111 --> 04:28:46.736]  The guy that they love so much was the first president we had that was at war for his entire eight years, Barack Obama.
[04:28:47.036 --> 04:28:52.901]  And so you got the Hollywood peace nicks that are out there always talking about peace and yet they're the ones pushing for war.
[04:28:52.921 --> 04:28:54.302]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[04:29:01.966 --> 04:29:04.989]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[04:29:05.909 --> 04:29:08.712]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[04:29:13.716 --> 04:29:25.465]  We are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[04:29:26.006 --> 04:29:29.128]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[04:29:29.909 --> 04:29:30.849]  What truly matters
[04:29:31.790 --> 04:29:38.693]  Is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[04:29:38.933 --> 04:29:50.017]  And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
[04:29:50.837 --> 04:29:52.118]  That all changes
[04:29:53.138 --> 04:29:59.403]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[04:29:59.503 --> 04:30:01.905]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[04:30:22.062 --> 04:30:23.963]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[04:30:24.564 --> 04:30:30.128]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[04:30:30.708 --> 04:30:38.694]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[04:30:38.714 --> 04:30:41.175]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[04:30:41.476 --> 04:30:45.679]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[04:30:45.959 --> 04:30:46.679]  This is how it works.
[04:30:46.979 --> 04:30:47.500]  You order.
[04:30:47.620 --> 04:30:48.420]  Customized or
[04:30:49.501 --> 04:30:50.982]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[04:30:51.463 --> 04:30:54.605]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[04:30:54.925 --> 04:30:58.988]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.969]  You cannot lose.
[04:30:59.989 --> 04:31:01.090]  You're funding the Infowar.
[04:31:01.410 --> 04:31:08.176]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[04:31:08.476 --> 04:31:12.419]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[04:31:17.065 --> 04:31:18.587]  There is a crisis in America today.
[04:31:19.047 --> 04:31:21.450]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[04:31:21.751 --> 04:31:29.159]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[04:31:29.560 --> 04:31:33.164]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[04:31:33.525 --> 04:31:34.646]  I have the answer for you today.
[04:31:35.067 --> 04:31:36.148]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[04:31:36.957 --> 04:31:39.940]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone, and it's safe.
[04:31:40.561 --> 04:31:42.263]  No radiation compartment.
[04:31:42.703 --> 04:31:48.469]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[04:31:49.290 --> 04:31:51.773]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[04:31:51.973 --> 04:31:57.919]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[04:31:58.680 --> 04:32:00.341]  With the Block It Pocket, this is impossible.
[04:32:00.821 --> 04:32:03.482]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[04:32:03.822 --> 04:32:18.628]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own Block It Pocket.
[04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.829]  Alex Jones.
[04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:21.370]  He was a nice guy, actually.
[04:32:21.390 --> 04:32:21.810]  You like him?
[04:32:23.154 --> 04:32:23.715]  Oh, that's good.
[04:32:23.875 --> 04:32:25.176]  Alex Jones.
[04:32:25.256 --> 04:32:25.697]  Nice guy.
[04:32:26.077 --> 04:32:33.805]  I know now, from top people, that you actually are for real, and you understand you're in danger, and you understand what you're doing, is epic.
[04:32:33.825 --> 04:32:35.307]  Your reputation's amazing.
[04:32:35.327 --> 04:32:37.109]  I will not let you down.
[04:32:37.289 --> 04:32:40.152]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[04:32:40.712 --> 04:32:45.474]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year and a year or two years.
[04:32:45.534 --> 04:32:48.175]  Let's give me a little bit of a time to run things.
[04:32:48.235 --> 04:32:52.617]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[04:32:52.637 --> 04:32:54.658]  He said he was going to do it, and he did a great job.
[04:32:54.698 --> 04:32:56.079]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[04:32:56.119 --> 04:32:57.739]  So while we're there, you probably read it.
[04:32:57.799 --> 04:32:59.840]  It was in Drudge, who's great, by the way.
[04:32:59.880 --> 04:33:01.121]  Drudge is amazing.
[04:33:01.801 --> 04:33:05.404]  But the story in Drudge and Big Story, it's all over the place, man.
[04:33:06.105 --> 04:33:09.147]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff.
[04:33:09.548 --> 04:33:13.831]  Struts swimming across the river.
[04:33:14.552 --> 04:33:15.312]  Swimming right across.
[04:33:15.893 --> 04:33:17.634]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[04:33:18.255 --> 04:33:19.035]  They're jumping in.
[04:33:19.075 --> 04:33:20.076]  They just jumped in the rafts.
[04:33:20.116 --> 04:33:23.299]  They're coming in one, two, three, four.
[04:33:23.319 --> 04:33:24.280]  They have big satchels.
[04:33:25.268 --> 04:33:30.850]  And actually the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[04:33:31.671 --> 04:33:35.292]  Because they're showing this on camera, the guys carrying bags of stuff, it was drugs.
[04:33:39.774 --> 04:33:42.255]  Thank you.
[04:33:42.295 --> 04:33:44.696]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America.
[04:33:44.736 --> 04:33:45.636]  Thank you so much, sir.
[04:33:46.076 --> 04:33:47.877]  You will be attacked for coming on, we know you know that.
[04:33:47.917 --> 04:33:48.257]  Thank you.
[04:33:48.878 --> 04:33:49.618]  Thank you very much.
[04:33:50.607 --> 04:33:55.089]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:57.150]  It's Alex Jones.
[04:33:58.391 --> 04:34:08.876]  There's no evidence of widespread voter fraud, of course, but there is one website that's reported this claim, this baseless claim, and it's one that maybe, I don't know, does Trump rely on this for his news?
[04:34:09.136 --> 04:34:15.979]  InfoWars is the brainchild of radio host Alex Jones, who Rolling Stone once called the most paranoid man in America.
[04:34:16.079 --> 04:34:19.621]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[04:34:20.001 --> 04:34:21.362]  I will not let you down.
[04:34:21.482 --> 04:34:24.403]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[04:34:24.963 --> 04:34:26.364]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[04:34:26.564 --> 04:34:38.329]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website InfoWars, which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[04:34:38.429 --> 04:34:40.830]  Does it scare you that the president-elect is listening to InfoWars?
[04:34:40.890 --> 04:34:48.413]  Jones can take credit for spearheading some of the most outrageous theories on the internet, from claims that 9-11 was a government conspiracy
[04:34:49.093 --> 04:34:51.454]  To the Sandy Hook shooting being faked.
[04:34:51.714 --> 04:34:58.397]  Jones has suggested that the 9-11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing were inside jobs by the U.S.
[04:34:58.457 --> 04:34:58.837]  government.
[04:34:59.077 --> 04:35:03.439]  And Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[04:35:03.619 --> 04:35:05.640]  Obama as the leader of ISIS.
[04:35:06.300 --> 04:35:10.802]  ISIS is honoring President Obama.
[04:35:11.262 --> 04:35:12.303]  He is the founder.
[04:35:13.141 --> 04:35:21.008]  Avaaz Jones' theories reach tens of millions each month, and are now often echoed by the next president of the United States.
[04:35:21.028 --> 04:35:27.014]  This is the man who's going to be president of the United States, going, you know, following InfoWars, talking about... Right, right.
[04:35:27.094 --> 04:35:27.775]  I don't know anything.
[04:35:27.795 --> 04:35:28.695]  It was an inside job.
[04:35:28.816 --> 04:35:34.521]  If Donald Trump based his voter fraud claim on what he read on InfoWars, it wouldn't be the first time.
[04:35:35.021 --> 04:35:43.027]  In a move that could further fuel concern, Alex Jones, operator of the InfoWars website, says Trump called to offer his gratitude.
[04:35:52.014 --> 04:35:59.799]  When Trump argued that thousands and thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the 9-11 attacks, he tweeted a link to InfoWars.
[04:35:59.959 --> 04:36:07.744]  When Jones posted this video entitled, An Emergency Message to Donald Trump During the Campaign... I am going to ask you...
[04:36:08.604 --> 04:36:18.810]  To seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[04:36:19.131 --> 04:36:21.792]  Trump had this to say a day later.
[04:36:21.852 --> 04:36:24.234]  I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[04:36:25.071 --> 04:36:27.473]  Because I think my side was rigged.
[04:36:27.793 --> 04:36:35.279]  And in the wake of the election, Jones pushing a theory that despite the vote totals, Trump actually won the popular vote.
[04:36:35.599 --> 04:36:36.860]  Millions of illegals voting.
[04:36:37.240 --> 04:36:39.702]  At least five states being stolen for Hillary.
[04:36:40.663 --> 04:36:41.924]  We're talking 5, 6, 7, 8 million people more.
[04:36:44.489 --> 04:36:48.391]  Voting for Trump, if you look at the evidence, in the popular vote than did.
[04:36:48.831 --> 04:37:00.695]  And Trump, tweeting just four days later, quote, in addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.
[04:37:01.135 --> 04:37:12.680]  I'll tell you, it is surreal to talk about issues here on air and then word for word hear Trump say it two days later.
[04:37:14.343 --> 04:37:14.683]  It is.
[04:37:14.703 --> 04:37:15.904]  Amazing.
[04:37:15.924 --> 04:37:18.985]  Where exactly does the president-elect get his information?
[04:37:19.025 --> 04:37:22.507]  Most importantly, perhaps, where does he get his intelligence information?
[04:37:22.647 --> 04:37:28.469]  It remains to be seen whether the conspiracy-driven website remains a go-to for the president-elect.
[04:37:28.729 --> 04:37:30.190]  Your reputation's amazing.
[04:37:30.650 --> 04:37:32.011]  I will not let you down.
[04:37:32.151 --> 04:37:35.052]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[04:37:35.632 --> 04:37:37.053]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[04:37:37.353 --> 04:37:39.734]  Randy Kay, CNN, New York.
[04:37:41.547 --> 04:37:44.409]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight here at the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[04:37:45.010 --> 04:37:49.894]  We're going to have a lot of guests that are going to be coming up as part of our live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration.
[04:37:49.914 --> 04:37:54.698]  We'll also be going to our reporters and Alex Jones, who are in Washington, D.C.
[04:37:54.718 --> 04:38:07.869]  Now, of course, Chicago's CBS affiliate is complaining, interestingly enough, about a California YMCA that is in Valparaiso, and they say that they took CNN off of their
[04:38:08.775 --> 04:38:09.175]  Monitor.
[04:38:09.836 --> 04:38:10.917]  Why do you think that would happen?
[04:38:11.297 --> 04:38:14.239]  After looking at that report, after looking, and of course, pull that up again.
[04:38:14.279 --> 04:38:15.800]  We talked about this briefly earlier.
[04:38:16.380 --> 04:38:29.710]  The video that they put up of Alex Jones with the lower thirds saying that he is a former KKK leader, that's what people are going to see if they're exercising in a YMCA.
[04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:33.192]  They're going to see, pull up that, you guys pulled that up earlier.
[04:38:33.533 --> 04:38:34.974]  We had that screen.
[04:38:35.014 --> 04:38:35.394]  There you go.
[04:38:35.834 --> 04:38:37.876]  See, if you're sitting there exercising,
[04:38:38.536 --> 04:38:40.596]  You're going to see CNN, you're going to see Alex Jones.
[04:38:40.616 --> 04:38:44.997]  You're not getting the audio, but it says, former KKK leader praises Trump for supporting him.
[04:38:45.497 --> 04:38:47.318]  Alex Jones hosts InfoWars.
[04:38:47.338 --> 04:38:47.978]  That's what they put up.
[04:38:48.058 --> 04:38:48.558]  Breaking news.
[04:38:48.738 --> 04:38:48.998]  Okay?
[04:38:50.618 --> 04:38:52.219]  So, it's amazing.
[04:38:52.699 --> 04:38:55.379]  That is why, I imagine, they took that off.
[04:38:55.519 --> 04:38:58.360]  And somebody said, well, I think they switched to the Cooking Channel.
[04:38:58.400 --> 04:39:00.120]  I guess, was that the Spirit Cooking Channel?
[04:39:00.140 --> 04:39:06.502]  I don't know, but I think, honestly, YMCA would not be putting up the Spirit Cooking Channel.
[04:39:06.522 --> 04:39:07.802]  That's what CNN would do.
[04:39:08.702 --> 04:39:29.823]  We also have a quite a number of documents that Donald Trump signed and we have reports coming out people are not sure exactly at this moment what all the papers that Donald Trump signed but he sat there for quite some time as we had the live feed the pool network feed was showing him signing paper after paper after paper we know that one of those
[04:39:30.504 --> 04:39:30.924]  We're good.
[04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:54.332]  We're looking at Trump, ISIS oil, and the relationship with Putin.
[04:39:55.172 --> 04:39:58.214]  Donald Trump said this in the inaugural speech.
[04:39:58.254 --> 04:40:02.156]  He said, we will enforce, reinforce old alliances and we will form new ones.
[04:40:02.936 --> 04:40:12.841]  And we will unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.
[04:40:13.826 --> 04:40:24.376]  Think about the fact that we just had a president as well as mainstream media, press corps, who could not bring themselves to ever use the term radical Islamic terrorism.
[04:40:25.036 --> 04:40:31.422]  Even when the radical Islamic terrorists were taking credit for what they did and saying we did it in the name of Islam.
[04:40:31.802 --> 04:40:37.087]  We just drove this truck or shot these people or blew up this building here.
[04:40:37.127 --> 04:40:38.528]  We did that in the name of radical Islam.
[04:40:38.548 --> 04:40:39.109]  They could not
[04:40:39.789 --> 04:40:42.030]  Even address what it was.
[04:40:42.490 --> 04:40:44.711]  Even when the people themselves were taking credit for it.
[04:40:45.211 --> 04:40:55.093]  Even when it was clear from videos that they had shot beforehand or diaries that they had left, what their motivation was, they would not even tell us the truth.
[04:40:55.333 --> 04:40:56.854]  They would not call it what it was.
[04:40:56.894 --> 04:40:59.355]  He's going to call it what it is and he's going to move against it.
[04:40:59.375 --> 04:41:07.637]  I want to go back and play this report here about Trump, ISIS oil and the relationship with Putin as we look at the fact that he's going to be building
[04:41:08.377 --> 04:41:10.399]  New relationships as well as old relationships.
[04:41:10.419 --> 04:41:21.608]  Donald Trump said, look, the problem with NATO isn't just the fact that it is set up for, let's hope that it is an obsolete idea, the Cold War, the military-industrial complex.
[04:41:22.659 --> 04:41:29.043]  Barack Obama, the Hollywood people who are out there like Robert De Niro, all are pushing, let's go to war with Russia.
[04:41:29.724 --> 04:41:31.685]  Let's revive these tensions.
[04:41:31.805 --> 04:41:33.266]  No, let's have detente.
[04:41:33.747 --> 04:41:34.787]  Let's ease the tensions.
[04:41:35.088 --> 04:41:36.769]  Let's give peace a chance.
[04:41:37.409 --> 04:41:38.470]  Okay, but they don't want that.
[04:41:38.530 --> 04:41:39.411]  They want to revive that.
[04:41:39.731 --> 04:41:42.172]  Donald Trump says, look, NATO was set up to deal with the Cold War.
[04:41:42.212 --> 04:41:44.234]  That's not really the threat we're facing right now.
[04:41:44.754 --> 04:41:48.357]  The threat we're facing is radical Islamic terror.
[04:41:48.937 --> 04:41:51.077]  And NATO has been completely ineffective with that.
[04:41:51.118 --> 04:41:53.358]  That may be why we need to have some new alliances, wouldn't it?
[04:41:54.278 --> 04:42:04.580]  And he also pointed out, and oh by the way, not only is it ineffective, not only is it targeted for an obsolete threat, but the people that are a part of it don't even want to pay for it.
[04:42:04.740 --> 04:42:05.761]  That should tell you something.
[04:42:05.881 --> 04:42:10.942]  If they're not willing to put any money into the support of NATO, maybe they don't believe that it's effective either.
[04:42:10.982 --> 04:42:16.203]  All these people who are wringing their hands in Europe and saying this is a problem, maybe it isn't a problem.
[04:42:16.977 --> 04:42:18.877]  We need to look at all of this stuff anew.
[04:42:18.918 --> 04:42:20.918]  We need to look at these trade deals that we have.
[04:42:21.478 --> 04:42:23.459]  We need to look at the alliances that we have.
[04:42:24.199 --> 04:42:28.160]  These institutions that have been put in place for 50, 60 years.
[04:42:28.200 --> 04:42:30.620]  And we need to reevaluate them from time to time, don't you think?
[04:42:31.521 --> 04:42:32.801]  That's what Donald Trump is doing.
[04:42:32.821 --> 04:42:36.302]  He's a fresh breath of air that is coming in.
[04:42:36.342 --> 04:42:40.503]  Let's take a look at this report where he looks at ISIS oil and the relationship with Putin.
[04:42:41.431 --> 04:42:43.595]  One thing with the oil, because you've covered it.
[04:42:44.176 --> 04:42:47.442]  For three years I've been saying hit the oil because ISIS is getting stronger.
[04:42:47.482 --> 04:42:51.208]  There's no JV, as the president said, and they're certainly not contained.
[04:42:51.749 --> 04:42:53.933]  But I said hit the oil and hit them hard.
[04:42:54.741 --> 04:42:55.522]  And they laughed at me.
[04:42:55.762 --> 04:42:59.484]  And they would put generals on television saying, no, that strategy wouldn't work.
[04:42:59.504 --> 04:43:01.466]  Well, after Paris, they started hitting the oil.
[04:43:01.926 --> 04:43:02.567]  And it does work.
[04:43:02.587 --> 04:43:05.108]  The problem is we've given them a two-year edge.
[04:43:05.128 --> 04:43:06.409]  They have billions of dollars.
[04:43:06.429 --> 04:43:10.052]  The Russians started hitting the oil for one month, and ISIS is already rolling over.
[04:43:10.372 --> 04:43:12.354]  So Putin is following your strategy.
[04:43:12.654 --> 04:43:13.955]  You know Vladimir Putin well.
[04:43:14.715 --> 04:43:16.416]  102 years ago, Alex, that's the only problem.
[04:43:16.516 --> 04:43:17.657]  Donald Trump joins us live.
[04:43:17.677 --> 04:43:24.622]  Can you speak to, as president, what your relationship would be with foreign leaders and what you know about Vladimir Putin?
[04:43:24.662 --> 04:43:28.625]  Because all I know is, why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us?
[04:43:29.205 --> 04:43:29.405]  Right.
[04:43:29.605 --> 04:43:33.688]  Well, number one, and just to finish on the oil, by the way, I say hit the oil, but we should keep the oil.
[04:43:33.908 --> 04:43:34.749]  In other words, we should keep it.
[04:43:34.769 --> 04:43:35.749]  We'll get Exxon Mobil.
[04:43:35.870 --> 04:43:36.430]  They'll go in.
[04:43:36.490 --> 04:43:38.231]  We'll get other of our oil companies.
[04:43:38.251 --> 04:43:39.592]  We'll get some of the great oil companies.
[04:43:39.893 --> 04:43:40.453]  We bid it out.
[04:43:40.633 --> 04:43:41.374]  We should keep the oil.
[04:43:41.594 --> 04:43:43.996]  You know, in the old days, to the victor belong the spoils, right?
[04:43:44.056 --> 04:43:44.636]  We don't have that.
[04:43:44.716 --> 04:43:45.176]  We go in.
[04:43:45.216 --> 04:43:46.197]  We fight a war and we leave.
[04:43:46.417 --> 04:43:49.660]  We get nothing, except we get death and we get deficit.
[04:43:49.740 --> 04:43:50.440]  That's all we get.
[04:43:51.161 --> 04:43:52.762]  I think I get along great with people.
[04:43:52.802 --> 04:43:54.704]  I mean, I will probably get along well with him.
[04:43:54.744 --> 04:43:56.125]  And if I don't, somebody else will.
[04:43:56.185 --> 04:43:56.905]  And who knows?
[04:43:56.925 --> 04:43:58.186]  You know, he's a difficult cookie.
[04:43:58.687 --> 04:43:59.767]  He's tough and he's smart.
[04:43:59.927 --> 04:44:02.810]  I was on the show 60 Minutes with him recently.
[04:44:03.570 --> 04:44:04.230]  Not together.
[04:44:04.290 --> 04:44:07.171]  I mean, they did him and they profiled me at the same show, which was there.
[04:44:07.211 --> 04:44:08.291]  We were stablemates, right?
[04:44:08.711 --> 04:44:10.752]  But I think I'd get along very well with him.
[04:44:10.812 --> 04:44:11.892]  I think it'd do fine.
[04:44:11.912 --> 04:44:13.293]  Look, here's the thing.
[04:44:13.653 --> 04:44:16.454]  We lose with every country, and yet we don't get along with any countries.
[04:44:16.554 --> 04:44:17.654]  China is killing us.
[04:44:17.854 --> 04:44:18.874]  Everybody's killing us.
[04:44:19.034 --> 04:44:21.115]  China's just beating us to a pulp and trade.
[04:44:21.155 --> 04:44:24.956]  Japan, Mexico is killing us, and yet we don't get along with anybody.
[04:44:25.416 --> 04:44:26.977]  With me, they're not going to get so rich.
[04:44:27.057 --> 04:44:29.018]  Believe me, they're not going to get so rich at all.
[04:44:29.278 --> 04:44:30.459]  We're going to take back our jobs.
[04:44:30.479 --> 04:44:32.019]  We're going to take back our manufacture.
[04:44:32.080 --> 04:44:35.421]  We take back our base, but they'll like us more than they do now.
[04:44:38.063 --> 04:44:42.445]  And again, that was Donald Trump as he was interviewed by Alex Jones on our show.
[04:44:43.325 --> 04:44:44.806]  You know, he says maybe we should keep the oil.
[04:44:44.826 --> 04:44:46.427]  Well, you know who is keeping the oil?
[04:44:46.927 --> 04:44:48.068]  ISIS is keeping the oil.
[04:44:48.909 --> 04:45:05.480]  Remember we talked about the fact that Barack Obama has dropped like 25,000 bombs in that area that ISIS controls and Russia pointed out, you know, isn't it interesting that not one single bomb out of those 25,000 that you dropped landed on an ISIS wall field?
[04:45:06.215 --> 04:45:17.026]  And of course we see convoys of trucks that are carrying ISIS oil freely going back and forth from the oil fields into Turkey, never attacked.
[04:45:17.626 --> 04:45:22.351]  Even though the media can get video of that, and our satellites apparently don't know that it's there.
[04:45:22.971 --> 04:45:24.313]  They can't get any drones there.
[04:45:24.793 --> 04:45:25.574]  Isn't that curious?
[04:45:25.914 --> 04:45:29.458]  Isn't it curious, as we pointed out at the very beginning of this, years ago,
[04:45:30.672 --> 04:45:39.814]  All of the convoy of small Toyota pickup trucks, you know, the Hilux trucks that just keep going and going and going, you know, the EverReady trucks that the terrorists love to use.
[04:45:40.114 --> 04:45:44.514]  There are all these convoys and people just sitting up on top of them, driving around.
[04:45:44.534 --> 04:45:45.695]  They're not in tanks or anything.
[04:45:45.735 --> 04:45:49.235]  This is a bunch of Yahoos with Arabic headbands on.
[04:45:49.795 --> 04:45:52.036]  And nobody did anything to attack those convoys.
[04:45:52.696 --> 04:45:58.617]  And yet, we have situations where, miraculously, even though we can't drop any bombs on them, we somehow
[04:45:59.497 --> 04:46:03.559]  Mistakenly drop arms and parachute those down to the ISIS people.
[04:46:03.579 --> 04:46:04.399]  Oh, that was a mistake.
[04:46:04.799 --> 04:46:05.459]  Didn't mean to do that.
[04:46:05.779 --> 04:46:09.821]  Didn't mean to clear out and leave behind an entire arsenal for ISIS.
[04:46:09.861 --> 04:46:15.343]  We didn't mean to bring in this Chechen Islamic terrorist that had been attacking Russia.
[04:46:15.383 --> 04:46:20.605]  We didn't mean to bring him in from Chechnya as our surrogate into ISIS, did we?
[04:46:21.656 --> 04:46:31.700]  They tried to push that war, and we pushed back very hard against that narrative that only the Syrian government could have launched that sarin gas attack against the civilians.
[04:46:32.481 --> 04:46:41.885]  We said that's a lie, that's not true, this has happened before, and we had UN weapons inspectors, we had Russian inspectors, and eventually
[04:46:42.759 --> 04:46:45.582]  American military came in and said, no, that's not true.
[04:46:45.863 --> 04:46:47.204]  That could have been done by anyone.
[04:46:47.264 --> 04:46:49.647]  It didn't have to be done by the Syrian army.
[04:46:49.988 --> 04:46:54.433]  That is not a pretext for going to war that we should be paying attention to.
[04:46:55.165 --> 04:46:59.026]  We had soldiers holding up signs saying, we're not going to be Al Qaeda's air force.
[04:46:59.066 --> 04:47:01.787]  We had Ron Paul saying that and Rand Paul saying that.
[04:47:01.807 --> 04:47:03.268]  We're not going to be Al Qaeda's air force.
[04:47:03.528 --> 04:47:07.469]  So we did not get involved with the ground war in Syria at that time.
[04:47:07.509 --> 04:47:08.530]  We pushed back against that.
[04:47:08.650 --> 04:47:14.272]  Now we have a president who understands that lie, who understands what they were trying to do.
[04:47:14.772 --> 04:47:20.654]  We've got another clip that I want to play for you, another commentary, Donald Trump and ISIS.
[04:47:21.294 --> 04:47:22.615]  Let's go to that next report here.
[04:47:23.803 --> 04:47:26.449]  And we don't want to have to use it.
[04:47:27.671 --> 04:47:29.114]  Ideally, we don't have to use it.
[04:47:29.655 --> 04:47:33.262]  Although, we will destroy ISIS.
[04:47:40.831 --> 04:47:47.777]  At the same time, we will pursue a new foreign policy that finally learns from the mistakes of the past.
[04:47:48.237 --> 04:47:54.042]  We will stop looking to topple regimes and overthrow governments, folks.
[04:47:55.463 --> 04:47:59.667]  Remember, six trillion dollars, six trillion, in the Middle East.
[04:48:00.916 --> 04:48:01.957]  Six trillion.
[04:48:02.718 --> 04:48:05.220]  Our goal is stability, not chaos.
[04:48:06.061 --> 04:48:09.504]  Because we want to rebuild our country.
[04:48:09.584 --> 04:48:10.185]  It's time.
[04:48:11.126 --> 04:48:11.686]  It's time.
[04:48:14.348 --> 04:48:23.597]  We will partner with any nation that is willing to join us in the effort to defeat ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism.
[04:48:23.997 --> 04:48:24.358]  Okay?
[04:48:24.398 --> 04:48:25.539]  We have to say the term.
[04:48:25.839 --> 04:48:26.760]  Have to say the term.
[04:48:28.652 --> 04:48:31.214]  That was Donald Trump at one of his stump speeches.
[04:48:31.254 --> 04:48:31.834]  You heard that.
[04:48:32.335 --> 04:48:35.637]  We have to use the term radical Islamic terrorism.
[04:48:35.937 --> 04:48:37.398]  He used it again today.
[04:48:37.478 --> 04:48:41.421]  He said the same things today that he was saying when he ran for office.
[04:48:41.481 --> 04:48:42.282]  Isn't that refreshing?
[04:48:42.542 --> 04:48:49.267]  Even though we've had, in the wake of his election, we've had nothing but mainstream media saying, seriously, you can't truly believe that.
[04:48:49.994 --> 04:48:51.695]  You can't really mean what you say.
[04:48:52.496 --> 04:48:53.697]  You can't really be doing this.
[04:48:53.737 --> 04:48:54.758]  This isn't really happening.
[04:48:54.798 --> 04:48:55.959]  Donald Trump can't be our president.
[04:48:55.979 --> 04:48:56.440]  Well, he is.
[04:48:57.140 --> 04:49:08.490]  He is our president now, and he said today, we will reinforce old alliances, form new ones, and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.
[04:49:08.530 --> 04:49:10.031]  He's not afraid to use the term.
[04:49:10.752 --> 04:49:15.576]  Some of the key mistakes that we made in the past were that we could not even use that term.
[04:49:15.596 --> 04:49:17.317]  All right, let's go to
[04:49:18.735 --> 04:49:22.621]  We've got one more report here that I want to run as we were running that report.
[04:49:22.641 --> 04:49:26.127]  We've got, actually, we've got just a little bit of time before we go to break.
[04:49:26.167 --> 04:49:32.778]  I want to remind you, as we have crew in the field in Washington, D.C., you can support the InfoWars operation.
[04:49:33.666 --> 04:49:38.870]  By the sales that we have here at InfoWars, and we've put a new sale on for the inauguration.
[04:49:38.910 --> 04:49:42.193]  That's 30 to 40 percent off InfoWars select storable food.
[04:49:42.893 --> 04:49:53.662]  If you want to prepare for an uncertain future, if you want to prepare for bad weather, you know, in spite of man-made global warming, we had massive ice storms and snow and the shelves emptied.
[04:49:53.702 --> 04:49:58.505]  If you want to protect yourself against that, protect yourself against unexpected price increases,
[04:49:59.326 --> 04:50:01.850]  Freeze your price and get it at 30 to 40% off.
[04:50:01.890 --> 04:50:03.432]  That food lasts for 25 years.
[04:50:03.552 --> 04:50:04.393]  All made in America.
[04:50:04.413 --> 04:50:05.655]  Non-GMO.
[04:50:06.156 --> 04:50:07.157]  Great packaging.
[04:50:07.398 --> 04:50:09.320]  And it is resealable once you open it.
[04:50:09.380 --> 04:50:09.881]  Stay with us.
[04:50:10.101 --> 04:50:12.244]  We're going to be right back with guests and with...
[04:50:22.688 --> 04:50:30.590]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[04:50:30.630 --> 04:50:32.591]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[04:50:33.351 --> 04:50:40.253]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[04:50:40.873 --> 04:50:46.635]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20, because we private label some, but we also develop
[04:50:47.538 --> 04:50:57.311]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[04:50:57.331 --> 04:50:59.474]  Exactly, you talk about being a game changer, right?
[04:50:59.494 --> 04:51:04.140]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders, we've both talked to them.
[04:51:04.440 --> 04:51:10.344]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[04:51:10.685 --> 04:51:19.651]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[04:51:20.532 --> 04:51:21.633]  We refuse to screw people.
[04:51:21.973 --> 04:51:22.954]  We refuse to do that.
[04:51:23.334 --> 04:51:25.976]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[04:51:26.076 --> 04:51:27.998]  We're producing something we want to take.
[04:51:28.098 --> 04:51:28.498]  Exactly.
[04:51:28.638 --> 04:51:29.918]  We're looking for the best.
[04:51:29.958 --> 04:51:34.819]  We went out and searched for the best, the private label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[04:51:35.039 --> 04:51:38.700]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[04:51:38.720 --> 04:51:44.701]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[04:51:44.981 --> 04:51:46.181]  It's everywhere.
[04:51:46.361 --> 04:51:47.041]  It's in nature.
[04:51:47.101 --> 04:51:49.242]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[04:51:49.562 --> 04:51:55.603]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[04:51:56.803 --> 04:52:02.047]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[04:52:02.087 --> 04:52:02.727]  This is insane.
[04:52:02.747 --> 04:52:11.914]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000 and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[04:52:11.934 --> 04:52:12.815]  People will buy more of it.
[04:52:12.835 --> 04:52:13.756]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[04:52:13.916 --> 04:52:14.096]  Okay.
[04:52:14.536 --> 04:52:15.417]  Compare that to this.
[04:52:15.617 --> 04:52:17.018]  This is a $50 product.
[04:52:17.038 --> 04:52:20.421]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[04:52:20.441 --> 04:52:20.561]  Okay.
[04:52:20.661 --> 04:52:20.841]  We have 10,000.
[04:52:20.881 --> 04:52:21.642]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[04:52:24.684 --> 04:52:26.545]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[04:52:26.946 --> 04:52:32.210]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:36.093]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[04:52:36.514 --> 04:52:42.458]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product,
[04:52:43.593 --> 04:52:45.194]  My quality of life just isn't as good.
[04:52:45.274 --> 04:52:46.374]  It's changed my life.
[04:52:46.474 --> 04:52:48.715]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[04:52:49.055 --> 04:52:50.915]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[04:52:51.316 --> 04:52:52.756]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[04:52:52.816 --> 04:52:53.676]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[04:52:54.577 --> 04:53:01.639]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[04:53:02.039 --> 04:53:02.799]  It's a win-win.
[04:53:03.280 --> 04:53:04.060]  Infowarslife.com.
[04:53:23.732 --> 04:53:27.097]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[04:53:27.137 --> 04:53:28.559]  I'm David Knight and we're looking at the
[04:53:29.418 --> 04:53:31.480]  Trump inauguration, the parade is about to begin.
[04:53:31.540 --> 04:53:39.366]  Right now we just have Color Guard and the police going down, but there's going to be more of a parade as this develops.
[04:53:39.386 --> 04:53:40.606]  We have some guests coming up.
[04:53:40.647 --> 04:53:42.708]  Leanne McAdoo is going to be taking over in the next segment.
[04:53:43.549 --> 04:53:47.332]  She's going to have Adam Curry, I believe, joining her as we come up.
[04:53:47.392 --> 04:53:50.214]  But just to point out that this is a global movement.
[04:53:51.164 --> 04:54:06.776]  Of course, Donald Trump is at the forefront of this, but just to show that this is a global movement, we've seen in the last day news come out of Britain that they're going to be setting up, and this is somebody who spent more money than anyone has ever spent on British politics.
[04:54:06.896 --> 04:54:13.742]  A millionaire there in Britain is going to be funding a website, a news aggregation website, as well as content generation.
[04:54:13.762 --> 04:54:15.083]  They're going to call it Westmonster.
[04:54:15.803 --> 04:54:20.285]  Because, of course, Westminster is the way they refer to their government there.
[04:54:20.305 --> 04:54:25.066]  As we would refer to Capitol Hill, they talk about Westminster, the physical seat of government.
[04:54:25.086 --> 04:54:26.447]  So they're going to call it Westminster.
[04:54:26.987 --> 04:54:28.448]  It is going to be a news aggregation site.
[04:54:28.468 --> 04:54:30.408]  It is also going to have original content.
[04:54:30.428 --> 04:54:34.670]  Their very first article is going to be an op-ed piece by Nigel Farage.
[04:54:34.790 --> 04:54:38.872]  And, of course, Nigel Farage was in the United States for the inauguration.
[04:54:39.352 --> 04:54:42.213]  He said, Donald Trump is Brexit plus.
[04:54:42.893 --> 04:54:46.574]  And he said, being in the room with Donald Trump makes me feel like an introvert.
[04:54:46.994 --> 04:54:52.135]  And of course now news comes out that Nigel Farage is going to become a commentator on Fox News.
[04:54:52.975 --> 04:55:01.436]  And at the same time this is happening, we see leaders from France, from Denmark I believe it was, all meeting in Germany.
[04:55:01.516 --> 04:55:07.097]  And of course these are the people that the mainstream media loves to demonize as the far right.
[04:55:07.538 --> 04:55:09.218]  You notice they never call these people that are
[04:55:10.000 --> 04:55:11.181]  Here attacking women.
[04:55:11.361 --> 04:55:12.782]  They never call them the far left.
[04:55:12.842 --> 04:55:14.783]  They never call them the radical left.
[04:55:15.463 --> 04:55:17.124]  Just like they can't talk about radical Islam.
[04:55:17.144 --> 04:55:21.346]  They can't use the terms radical, extremist, socialist, left.
[04:55:22.447 --> 04:55:26.989]  And as Rob Dew pointed out, hey, you guys want to call everybody Nazis and say they're right-wing fascists?
[04:55:27.029 --> 04:55:31.572]  Remember that Adolf Hitler called himself a national socialist.
[04:55:32.592 --> 04:55:34.874]  He just approached authoritarianism
[04:55:35.962 --> 04:55:36.082]  And
[04:55:55.077 --> 04:55:56.638]  The Nolan chart, guys.
[04:55:56.678 --> 04:55:58.818]  This is one of the founders of the Libertarian Party.
[04:55:59.299 --> 04:56:00.319]  And he really mapped this out.
[04:56:00.339 --> 04:56:08.162]  He took a grid, and he mapped out people's positions on economic issues, economic freedom, as well as political freedom.
[04:56:08.282 --> 04:56:10.063]  Your civil liberties, as we're told, right?
[04:56:11.044 --> 04:56:15.428]  So down at the origin, you would have neither political freedom nor economic freedom.
[04:56:15.888 --> 04:56:24.795]  And they took that chart, normally you see a chart, he rotated it 45 degrees, if you're looking at this, I'm trying to describe this for people who are not watching it, rotated it 45 degrees so you got a diamond.
[04:56:25.215 --> 04:56:30.460]  So down at the bottom, that is no economic freedom, no civil liberties freedom.
[04:56:30.840 --> 04:56:32.421]  That's the authoritarian quadrant.
[04:56:32.841 --> 04:56:35.984]  That's where both Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin are.
[04:56:36.004 --> 04:56:37.745]  Now they came at it from different directions.
[04:56:38.066 --> 04:56:38.766]  Adolf Hitler said,
[04:56:39.967 --> 04:56:40.888]  Stalin made a mistake.
[04:56:41.389 --> 04:56:44.493]  He nationalized the industries first, so he weakened himself.
[04:56:44.653 --> 04:56:46.955]  I'm going to leave them under government control.
[04:56:46.995 --> 04:56:47.616]  That's fascism.
[04:56:47.656 --> 04:56:48.838]  That's economic fascism.
[04:56:49.258 --> 04:56:52.162]  See, fascism isn't just extreme nationalism.
[04:56:52.822 --> 04:56:53.483]  It is also
[04:56:54.557 --> 04:57:02.021]  Retaining control of these corporations, which, you know, crony capitalism and private-public partnerships, they start to get pretty close to that.
[04:57:02.061 --> 04:57:08.144]  That's what we need to guard against as we start to move towards undoing the globalists.
[04:57:08.184 --> 04:57:13.727]  We need to be careful about private-public partnerships because that can be a kind of crony capitalism, a kind of fascism.
[04:57:14.560 --> 04:57:27.371]  But to keep control of those, to let them be vital, to let them still operate as a business's profit, Hitler was right when he said that made him stronger, whereas Stalin eviscerated these by taking them over with the government.
[04:57:27.391 --> 04:57:30.973]  That's what we saw in Central America with Venezuela and Hugo Chavez and others.
[04:57:31.294 --> 04:57:32.335]  That kind of corruption.
[04:57:32.975 --> 04:57:37.157]  The bottom line, folks, is that the authoritarians don't want you to have any freedom.
[04:57:37.417 --> 04:57:39.058]  They don't want you to have any free speech.
[04:57:39.098 --> 04:57:43.000]  They're not exercising free speech when they punch you in the face.
[04:57:43.080 --> 04:57:43.521]  Stay with us.
[04:57:43.761 --> 04:57:46.282]  We'll be right back with Leanne McAdoo and guests.
[04:57:55.207 --> 04:57:59.169]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[04:58:03.507 --> 04:58:10.397]  We are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another.
[04:58:11.118 --> 04:58:17.527]  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you,
