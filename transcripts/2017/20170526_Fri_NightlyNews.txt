[00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:27.448]  While most to celebrate memorial honoring our nation's progressive left parade and honorist, Oscar, the man responds to bumps used in the night bombing of a restaurant.
[00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:35.473]  How outrageous to think that this man parade after he bombed poor Manhattan, what, and killed four people.
[00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:39.917]  Police are blocking over the root cause hack in Manchester.
[00:00:40.057 --> 00:00:41.418]  Up next on the Italy News.
[00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:46.400]  During this Memorial Day, hot.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.666]  But of course, most importantly, is that's what this holiday take advantage of and help support against the globalist while supplies the biggest sales.

[00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:44.626]  What about the different Memorial Day?
[00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.768]  We too celebrate pay however enlisted in art.
[00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:56.974]  Whereas Memorial Dinner and veterans that fought during their life for our institutional rights, our Bill of Rights, our Second Amendment, and so on so dear today.
[00:01:57.435 --> 00:01:58.936]  This article from Huffington.
[00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:01.798]  Apparently Huffington understand perks.
[00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:05.609]  But people still have the right to yelling fire in a movie theater.
[00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.130]  Because it can cause pets against people.
[00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:34.318]  But this is a term that's being applied that people disagree with, which is, and in these SJ California, it's almost all liberals, everything conservatives say in, which is why I don't even.
[00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:41.584]  That's right, they want to pacified, uh, in this harassment, or don't and so forth, so that you could actually, for saying something that needs speech.
[00:02:41.624 --> 00:02:45.487]  Well, it's a down, it's a tumbling, slippery slope, right?
[00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:49.931]  Then it becomes a matter of everyone's opinion, and next thing you know, somebody's speech that,
[00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:54.887]  And whatever political pardon, or whatever at the time, they're determined.
[00:02:55.327 --> 00:03:00.970]  And what is, so I don't want to start going while we have a conservative, we have a liberal government.
[00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.712]  We're gonna, they're going to crack down on things like Infowars.
[00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:04.492]  It's gonna be shit.
[00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:07.974]  Everything we say here, Alex Jones Show, all of that, we are hate speech.
[00:03:08.407 --> 00:03:11.189]  They use hate speech to say that they don't like the thing.
[00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.951]  And that's why we've seen Hannity actually.
[00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:15.292]  Some trouble right now.
[00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:18.274]  A is the latest company to tising from Shant Show.
[00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:23.498]  Well, USA services company is to military men or military women and their family.
[00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:26.240]  Next thing you know, advertising from the show.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.323]  It was not in the political opinions with.
[00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:30.844]  And you know others as well.
[00:03:31.164 --> 00:03:31.864]  This is what she said.
[00:03:31.904 --> 00:03:34.827]  To all my friends, Rose and Hillary Clinton matters.
[00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:37.569]  It's targeting all of my advertised.
[00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.472]  This is so they lost the election.
[00:03:39.712 --> 00:03:40.073]  Their win.
[00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:43.175]  And when she didn't go after conservative financially.
[00:03:43.575 --> 00:03:44.476]  So they went InfoWars.
[00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.357]  We had the whole thing with.
[00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:47.238]  Costing InfoWars some of money.
[00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:52.402]  And from Breitbart because these people that's in you know ex these advertiser groups.
[00:03:53.023 --> 00:03:53.944]  InfoWars hate group.
[00:03:54.224 --> 00:03:55.485]  Sean Hannity telling the truth.
[00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:56.846]  And if it's and convince you.
[00:03:57.747 --> 00:03:59.088]  But to go after these organing.
[00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:00.342]  It.
[00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:01.783]  And that's, that's the only reason.
[00:04:01.803 --> 00:04:02.043]  Exactly.
[00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:03.084]  It's a way of censorship.
[00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:05.285]  It's important to know the rights that we have.
[00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:07.067]  The first died for those rights.
[00:04:07.107 --> 00:04:08.207]  Don't protect those rights.
[00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:08.968]  Easily.
[00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:12.690]  Let the who, most of them are baby babies that live in their parents.
[00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:15.312]  Understand what they're and risk your life.
[00:04:15.332 --> 00:04:16.693]  Somebody else's right.
[00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:17.674]  Can't let them do that.
[00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:20.636]  We have those rights and and to died for our rights.
[00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:27.680]  So, um, I wanted to clip here where I did a couple years in Los Angeles, a veteran over in LA.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.261]  The land, they were getting looted.
[00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:33.123]  Disappropriated to house a homeless veteran.
[00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:42.388]  Angeles has huge massive and all these buildings that the VA was, I mean, it's, it's so these veterans that are so high.
[00:04:43.288 --> 00:04:45.309]  Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely horrible.
[00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.510]  Home, a veteran's home.
[00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.794]  I'm going into so that examples was so that, uh, parking could land from golf course.
[00:04:52.854 --> 00:04:54.255]  Yeah, that's more important than housing.
[00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:54.836]  We should, uh.
[00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:56.277]  They had major motion.
[00:04:56.437 --> 00:05:00.119]  Having a lease agreement here so they can go film new special events.
[00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:01.840]  Their little private fair.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.883]  This, uh, dog people to come and walk their dog on the veteran's land.
[00:05:05.923 --> 00:05:07.624]  Giant cages around this turns out.
[00:05:07.644 --> 00:05:11.307]  You actually had homeless side of these cages and will to be treating our veterans.
[00:05:11.387 --> 00:05:12.888]  Head and roll to this clack.

[00:05:49.638 --> 00:05:51.499]  Fifty-five.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.283]  The nabled volunteer soldier in establishing the National Home.
[00:05:56.383 --> 00:05:57.244]  Sixty-five.

[00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:33.287]  Within the county.
[00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:34.268]  It had everything.
[00:06:34.348 --> 00:06:37.170]  Some fifty acres under cultivated trees all over the place.
[00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.131]  It's free anymore.
[00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.093]  However, a lot.
[00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:44.837]  Government Doc, Los Angeles VA, has been renting out chunks of its enterprises.

[00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:06.700]  This was a gift.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.060]  It was lost.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.182]  They opened the first.
[00:07:08.202 --> 00:07:09.403]  After the Civil War.
[00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:10.985]  Save all homeless men.
[00:07:11.065 --> 00:07:11.185]  This.
[00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:24.959]  Well, and it makes sure we always be funded.

[00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:50.988]  Department of Interior is the sawtail.
[00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:54.591]  Even though the oily vested to the original D.
[00:07:56.892 --> 00:07:57.753]  As a baseball diehard.
[00:07:57.773 --> 00:08:01.155]  If we would reference the matter of baseball, we would be the problem.
[00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:03.376]  The Senate Waxman had one dollar.
[00:08:17.214 --> 00:08:20.215]  One homeless veteran has been put onto them through the zoo.

[00:08:55.176 --> 00:08:55.957]  I don't know.
[00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:57.057]  This is fun here.
[00:08:57.077 --> 00:09:00.158]  This is the parks and recreation of the government.
[00:09:00.758 --> 00:09:01.879]  Snooping around at us.
[00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:02.759]  It wakes us up.
[00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:07.440]  So unacceptable how in America Michael Zimmerman who has something.

[00:09:43.022 --> 00:09:45.264]  Pathetic materials ever create molecular weight.
[00:09:45.344 --> 00:09:47.085]  Polyether is also super compact.

[00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:06.599]  Me too.
[00:10:06.619 --> 00:10:08.161]  Uh, I work, if not more.
[00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:09.842]  I hear you're okay.
[00:10:09.882 --> 00:10:10.823]  I'm terrible.
[00:10:10.863 --> 00:10:11.424]  I'm terrible.
[00:10:11.524 --> 00:10:18.150]  But I have a lot of aches and this weird joint stuff there's and, uh, the caveman bone, our joint formula.
[00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.472]  It's just, uh, you know, that's just experience.
[00:10:21.113 --> 00:10:24.196]  Um, and I think if anybody else has it, definitely you owe it to yourself to check.

[00:10:26.638 --> 00:10:30.982]  And actually we were talking about this earlier, doing just now, like for now, after I play Bacon.
[00:10:31.102 --> 00:10:35.526]  But the Bone Broth, you combine those two, I felt it.
[00:10:36.447 --> 00:10:37.928]  It actually tastes good, Key.
[00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.390]  And I, to me, I love chocolate.
[00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.792]  The flavor of the caveman.
[00:10:41.812 --> 00:10:43.153]  The Blom, Blom, Blom, Blom.
[00:10:43.353 --> 00:10:43.773]  Broth.
[00:10:44.014 --> 00:10:44.294]  Bone.
[00:10:44.494 --> 00:10:45.915]  Broth is really that gross.
[00:10:45.935 --> 00:10:47.196]  Because it tastes really.
[00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:48.618]  Favorite is the soup.
[00:10:48.638 --> 00:10:51.280]  So ladies, Genovitality, if you haven't.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.641]  Firstly, it just.
[00:10:52.701 --> 00:10:54.102]  I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff.
[00:10:54.122 --> 00:10:55.083]  For your wife then, too.
[00:10:55.143 --> 00:10:56.865]  Yeah, I go and take a bunch of it.
[00:10:56.985 --> 00:10:59.567]  I just start running, zip to the action, no fee.
[00:10:59.687 --> 00:11:00.687]  Well that's a big primary.
[00:11:00.928 --> 00:11:03.549]  Find the Globalists is making sure that we hide and stay honest.
[00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:04.909]  I hope that we do that here at Info.
[00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:09.591]  A lot going on and we're in the middle of it when anybody supports us using our products or you can even go and donate.
[00:11:10.451 --> 00:11:17.274]  Skin of our teeth, I know it looks like we're in Dollar Studio, but one cent of borrowed money and all money that's come from you.
[00:11:17.454 --> 00:11:21.376]  Built this place with your compassion and the support that you've sent.
[00:11:21.496 --> 00:11:24.079]  I appreciate it, because I know we voice it.
[00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:31.106]  Once again, we gotta for the steadfastness, even when we make mistakes, and even when we might go with us, and I appreciate it.
[00:11:33.892 --> 00:11:34.492]  I started.
[00:11:34.512 --> 00:11:35.713]  The fascist group.
[00:11:36.173 --> 00:11:36.833]  Rep Fronts.
[00:11:37.214 --> 00:11:37.694]  Facebook.
[00:11:37.714 --> 00:11:39.014]  The first post I noticed.
[00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:41.756]  The recent March for Trump group of anti-fascists.
[00:11:41.796 --> 00:11:43.176]  Attempt to shut it down.
[00:11:43.216 --> 00:11:44.717]  In an antis.
[00:11:44.897 --> 00:11:45.897]  Kit O'Connell.
[00:11:45.917 --> 00:11:47.178]  They had a fundraiser.
[00:11:47.298 --> 00:11:48.619]  Asking for donations.
[00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:48.959]  Rad.
[00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:50.039]  The money will.
[00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:50.900]  Hospital bill.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:51.320]  Reps.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.780]  Missed work and up.
[00:11:53.121 --> 00:11:54.101]  As well as legal.
[00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:55.802]  They even railers.
[00:11:56.242 --> 00:11:56.842]  So my next.
[00:11:56.922 --> 00:11:58.203]  Who were these donors?
[00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.483]  Anti-fascists.
[00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:02.165]  Donor page had names and their contributions.
[00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.065]  And to answer.
[00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:05.046]  Exactly were these people.
[00:12:05.066 --> 00:12:06.386]  Were fellow college students.
[00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:07.867]  Talking, finding, evolving.
[00:12:08.007 --> 00:12:09.067]  Were professors.
[00:12:09.147 --> 00:12:10.567]  University professors.
[00:12:10.808 --> 00:12:18.750]  So why would a-er be donating an individual that's a-er's group and he found for rioting, v-attacking Donald Trump?
[00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.571]  Now, the tra-er-cities.
[00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:24.772]  In-ed about how students that took justice studies, $800, and they even gay-ers.
[00:12:27.453 --> 00:12:31.015]  Which gained them views, a special cumruz, and raid.
[00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:35.958]  Why would university scholarships and spec students that took sex programs?
[00:12:36.418 --> 00:12:40.840]  Cool thought was to Justice Programs, the University of Tech art.
[00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:45.763]  I fights and social just upon reading the program seemed pretty mild.
[00:12:45.923 --> 00:12:46.724]  I'll suck out.
[00:12:47.364 --> 00:12:49.125]  Connecting Experiencegram.
[00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:55.487]  Students need to compliment hands-on experience in working on Human Justice Concern.
[00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:58.288]  Found the link to the Human Justice Faculty Pen.
[00:12:58.328 --> 00:12:59.808]  Long list of professors.
[00:12:59.828 --> 00:13:00.989]  Summary of their course.
[00:13:01.689 --> 00:13:04.610]  What began on simply reading of what they taught.
[00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:06.911]  Shared some pretty exeges.
[00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:08.291]  And search.
[00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:13.313]  You could find lectures where you could hear extremist ideology even verging on.
[00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:17.214]  Here, what may seem like a, where does racism come from?
[00:13:17.394 --> 00:13:21.535]  Roots, does racism, and I think that question comes from whites.
[00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:25.655]  The idea that non-area in intellect from white folk.
[00:13:26.235 --> 00:13:39.058]  With a, my own position on these two, first of all, capitalist, without, the sense of the word cult, what I'm really arguing, it'd never be anything but a callism, a cult, but essentially a kind of death cult.
[00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:48.509]  Inclusions you would draw on crucial to God's Word, if you could, and what your senses could step back and look at what kind of Republican principles of mankind demanded.
[00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.515]  The law of nature and the laws of authoritarian Republican government all comes apart.
[00:13:54.278 --> 00:13:55.520]  We're good to go.
[00:14:09.597 --> 00:14:11.979]  I looked at KV and UT College Radio.
[00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:15.942]  Oh and behold, the students were affiliating with Antifa members.
[00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:25.869]  Across a UC radio interview, it was important to note that this professor published them just before the Berkeley riots broke out and the fascists shut down Amend.
[00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:33.635]  There came a sort of wingnut tea party of birthers where he gained a significant following.
[00:14:33.855 --> 00:14:36.617]  He was able to do his presidential bid.
[00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:39.343]  Through that came kind of a figurehead.
[00:14:39.483 --> 00:14:49.373]  A lot of Nazis and Southern... And so it was coalition, if you will, that Trump was able to compete and eventually win.
[00:14:50.162 --> 00:14:51.522]  It's a creeping fascism.
[00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:52.282]  Who's doing that?
[00:14:52.963 --> 00:14:58.264]  Consider the left and it's defining character remains decisively on the he needs to be opposed.
[00:14:58.344 --> 00:15:01.184]  He's from the rise of fascism.
[00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:05.185]  We make the call that the alt- Yeah, absolutely, that is to be opposed physically.
[00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:10.746]  And this prefix Jones and incented Alex's political order to create a fault.
[00:15:11.726 --> 00:15:16.007]  What they Jones and people like that alt-universe-ation was a
[00:15:16.812 --> 00:15:17.572]  Globalization.
[00:15:17.592 --> 00:15:19.033]  Expression of an ideology.
[00:15:19.233 --> 00:15:20.013]  Globalism.
[00:15:20.373 --> 00:15:21.553]  Cultural Marxist.
[00:15:21.613 --> 00:15:24.414]  We're trying to de-race and white people.
[00:15:25.394 --> 00:15:38.758]  What can you is that we have a few are trying to rewrite and falsely associate with Donald Trump and... It's despotism with fewer people.
[00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:40.770]  That's better.
[00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.151]  Charles Jones the Foon.
[00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:43.592]  An unarmed suspect.
[00:15:43.932 --> 00:15:44.893]  Six times.
[00:15:45.093 --> 00:15:46.193]  Using excessive force.
[00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:47.014]  Race the evidence.
[00:15:47.034 --> 00:15:47.834]  I'm not gross.
[00:15:47.894 --> 00:15:50.556]  Take me head or there's... Community rates low.
[00:15:51.296 --> 00:15:53.097]  When the pund other channels of community.
[00:15:53.117 --> 00:15:54.338]  Controlled by only a few people.
[00:15:54.378 --> 00:15:55.939]  These ethical questions about the usuries.
[00:15:55.999 --> 00:15:56.819]  About the government.
[00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:58.320]  That lotion that they were produced by.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:58.540]  The guy.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.301]  That's a crap kid.
[00:15:59.321 --> 00:16:00.801]  What does it make?
[00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:02.662]  Clinical signs of despotism.
[00:16:02.682 --> 00:16:03.543]  He looks beyond fine.
[00:16:04.123 --> 00:16:06.485]  There are actions to take as president.
[00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:07.586]  Those to more fairness.
[00:16:07.826 --> 00:16:08.387]  Tonight, I'm out.
[00:16:08.407 --> 00:16:09.788]  When I say go, come on around here.
[00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:12.009]  He came, he died.
[00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:19.075]  Yes, the modernary leaders are finding that are highly effective.
[00:16:19.135 --> 00:16:19.976]  Competitive about this.
[00:16:19.996 --> 00:16:23.038]  We need to weak and just really think about guns.
[00:16:23.318 --> 00:16:25.840]  We are trained to just really don't have to trust me.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.942]  Find my actually person is.
[00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:30.103]  And communitism stands a good chance.
[00:16:31.411 --> 00:16:32.611]  Why is the fungi?
[00:16:32.631 --> 00:16:33.952]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:16:33.972 --> 00:16:34.672]  That has changed.
[00:16:34.912 --> 00:16:38.713]  Dr. Grootly, in days, you've been testing an array of reviews from your, at your clinics.
[00:16:38.933 --> 00:16:41.534]  Mycosal fungal and yeast bumps and enzymes.
[00:16:41.554 --> 00:16:42.154]  Made with Hyde.
[00:16:42.174 --> 00:16:44.395]  Available at infomorestore.com for $50 or more.
[00:16:44.515 --> 00:16:46.455]  Antibiotics ship additionally on top of the shit.
[00:16:46.495 --> 00:16:47.375]  Dedicated to the truth.
[00:16:47.435 --> 00:16:48.376]  It's absolutely neat.
[00:16:48.456 --> 00:16:49.456]  But, we should provide it.
[00:16:49.496 --> 00:16:50.256]  This is not a game.
[00:16:50.276 --> 00:16:51.837]  It's a really big, uh, yeast leak.
[00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:53.337]  Uh, you know, there can be something in.
[00:16:53.717 --> 00:16:54.337]  But, uh, why?
[00:16:54.397 --> 00:16:55.178]  Well, what does it do?
[00:16:55.478 --> 00:17:00.141]  So, just like you have on what's currently, we stay ahead of the gang attack and address the root coven.
[00:17:00.241 --> 00:17:01.381]  Now we want stuff for our own kick.
[00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:06.604]  This is why we've... The president, you know, lets health problems, but we're getting back to fucking epidemic.
[00:17:06.805 --> 00:17:09.286]  Bats everywhere, other anguses were used as bio-
[00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:10.827]  Suddenly killing so many mammals.
[00:17:10.867 --> 00:17:14.348]  Growing epidemic in Iowa and making changes in 10 years.
[00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:25.914]  Here's the thing Alex, when you go to the show, you can look at fungus overgrowth and show you're going to pull up over everything from brain fog, lagnia, headaches, bowel, joint pain, it's linked to Crohn's Obesity Epidemic.
[00:17:25.974 --> 00:17:28.015]  I don't say it like that, they're just hoots.
[00:17:28.155 --> 00:17:30.977]  YeastOver by Jacob Tittlebaum at the Center in Dallas.

[00:17:46.586 --> 00:17:47.626]  We only have a limited supply.
[00:17:47.646 --> 00:17:48.607]  I just don't hear what you have to say.

[00:18:19.476 --> 00:18:22.019]  My morning was in- Guys, I love the InfoWars.

[00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:25.782]  Just buy it.

[00:18:27.824 --> 00:18:29.365]  It's the same thing you find at Life.com.
[00:18:29.425 --> 00:18:30.066]  It's a win-win.
[00:18:33.635 --> 00:18:42.380]  The Democrats and legal spying on the American people, the DNationals, they're... But it's in the news, they've like put a bunch of groups in charge of the careers, they're spying.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:56.008]  It's like, I can't believe... In the short segment, another segment, his law enforcement sources have maybe sealed some of the most elite groups, OSHA, you name it, from his, certainly to Trump, uh, him, and we know, they admit, call him inside, of all, ignoring, uh, the reform...
[00:18:57.878 --> 00:19:02.721]  A deep state from the Obama admibious who do everything he's trying to do.
[00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:08.483]  There are bastards that are out for power within levels of our government who just build whatever power that they upset.
[00:19:08.504 --> 00:19:11.725]  It's not like they go into a while in government and then go into civil society.
[00:19:11.765 --> 00:19:13.746]  They're there to uproot it just like a tick.
[00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:17.248]  There are those who for anything positive tries to do so.
[00:19:17.888 --> 00:19:27.414]  A lot of my friends in the federal law, they are good patriotic because who can fix things that we're facing as several in command within the and they will not act in good.
[00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:31.677]  They will, you know, help and others, you know, hide and thwart a lot of the investors.
[00:19:32.827 --> 00:19:37.308]  But I, my, what I, as he needs to grab and the directors look.
[00:19:37.808 --> 00:19:42.430]  My command, sir, is to your agency of all to serve in the America.

[00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:53.193]  Is to get rid of those who are against our Constitution, who we know are corrupt, if they're worse than that.
[00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:57.774]  To leak all this stuff that isn't easy to leak fake stuff, info, and then blame leaking.
[00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:04.733]  All the false acts tie up his supporters in defense.
[00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:06.777]  As you know, Democrat tents just tie him up.
[00:20:06.977 --> 00:20:08.199]  Yeah, they just want to tie him up.
[00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:11.639]  You can't busy him.
[00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:17.963]  What he needs to be doing is DOJ, and his DOJ need arresting and per his worst antagonist really deserve more.
[00:20:18.003 --> 00:20:19.784]  Needs to be ramped up big time.
[00:20:19.804 --> 00:20:20.744]  They need to start up.
[00:20:20.764 --> 00:20:22.225]  They call us fake news because we're.
[00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:24.767]  I'll put my money, my money.
[00:20:24.827 --> 00:20:25.467]  I'm not a hero.
[00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:26.087]  I'm not.
[00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:26.568]  Worshippers.
[00:20:26.988 --> 00:20:27.448]  I mean it's.
[00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:28.969]  Globalist Islam.
[00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.389]  Sorrows.
[00:20:29.849 --> 00:20:30.630]  I would be with them.
[00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.211]  Everybody's doing it.
[00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:33.691]  Craig, thank you for supporting us.
[00:20:33.731 --> 00:20:34.572]  We're all in this, you are.
[00:20:34.612 --> 00:20:35.412]  If you love God, I'd.
[00:20:36.753 --> 00:20:38.474]  Craig Love's just getting into the investigation.
[00:20:38.855 --> 00:20:39.615]  Stopping at the court.
[00:20:39.775 --> 00:20:41.016]  1,000 arrests now in total.
[00:20:41.036 --> 00:20:41.016]  150,000.
[00:20:41.797 --> 00:20:42.637]  And the whole B.I.
[00:20:42.657 --> 00:20:44.038]  was finally green-lighted to cover.
[00:20:44.638 --> 00:20:45.179]  Subcult.
[00:20:45.199 --> 00:20:46.440]  Globalist liberal culture.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.380]  Really all over TV.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.941]  Normalized on Saturday Night Live.
[00:20:48.961 --> 00:20:49.762]  That's cult.
[00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:50.723]  And their answer.
[00:20:52.344 --> 00:20:53.945]  Alex, it's pedophilia.
[00:20:53.965 --> 00:20:58.748]  It kind of permeates different groups of Americans and globalists to be tied into this.
[00:20:58.908 --> 00:21:00.209]  Like you call it a subculture.
[00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.890]  Child rape.
[00:21:02.331 --> 00:21:05.733]  I wish I could sing, but, you know, birds of a feather.
[00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:09.718]  Again, I just do with being in control of our country.
[00:21:09.738 --> 00:21:11.159]  American president again.
[00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:12.239]  Football, let's move it.
[00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:13.700]  It's good by how they're attacking him.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.421]  Yeah, yeah, look at their desperation.
[00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:18.762]  They're trying to say every which kind of excuse.
[00:21:18.822 --> 00:21:20.723]  So yeah, he's a real threat.
[00:21:20.743 --> 00:21:26.145]  He intends to act and put men's shame on us if we do not- Hey, he's not perfect, but- Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:26.165 --> 00:21:29.886]  I mean, the guy's trying to try the Constitution and re-establish freedom.
[00:21:29.946 --> 00:21:30.427]  Under assault.
[00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:31.667]  Yeah.
[00:21:31.687 --> 00:21:34.388]  Look at how you and I, we're not- We weren't, you know, with Christ.
[00:21:34.408 --> 00:21:35.549]  The attacks we're under are-
[00:21:37.236 --> 00:21:40.817]  And look at those, like, media mags that are- that are doing the will-ers like Soros.
[00:21:41.157 --> 00:21:42.597]  They're attacking, uh, Sean.
[00:21:42.757 --> 00:21:43.937]  Decent patriotic.
[00:21:44.017 --> 00:21:48.438]  Dares to still stand up and, uh, you know, the- the far-bags who are lying to the American Clintons.
[00:21:48.478 --> 00:21:49.399]  Just a nice person.
[00:21:49.439 --> 00:21:50.219]  Misunderstood.
[00:21:50.239 --> 00:21:54.880]  I mean, there's a- the truth that we're- We have to stand up and re-do Sean Hannity.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.160]  Uh, the- the truth.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.600]  Unite to fight back.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.441]  Who will continue attacking must unite again.
[00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:00.961]  It's time.
[00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:03.103]  Continue to watch things as they unfold.
[00:22:03.163 --> 00:22:04.524]  It's very positive, it's very negative.
[00:22:04.544 --> 00:22:05.545]  But Craig, I'm glad you're there.
[00:22:05.565 --> 00:22:07.447]  I'm gonna be launching more radio soon.
[00:22:07.727 --> 00:22:09.809]  I'd like to offer you either once a week or five days.
[00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:11.191]  With our tactical advisor here.
[00:22:11.211 --> 00:22:12.612]  Affiliates out there that are ready to pick up.
[00:22:12.632 --> 00:22:13.853]  So that's next level, my friend.
[00:22:14.714 --> 00:22:15.575]  Outstanding, Jeter.
[00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:16.096]  Thank you.
[00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.194]  Yes!
[00:22:25.654 --> 00:22:27.595]  An awful blowing up of the White House.
[00:22:27.615 --> 00:22:31.876]  Trump supporters to their car center, around the corner at San Carlos Street, Humber.
[00:22:31.956 --> 00:22:33.276]  You bought a truck!
[00:22:33.296 --> 00:22:33.717]  Yeah!
[00:22:34.477 --> 00:22:38.158]  Dragged a poor white guy out of- And his poor white people, please- Pure attacks.
[00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:42.819]  Women, even the last night, and walked- Anti-Trump protesters.
[00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:45.360]  Including a girl outside Anaheim.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.521]  And the guy who, oh, he just got knocked into the face.
[00:22:55.796 --> 00:23:05.823]  We're Sayre and you're trying to rep to free speech to it's your right to ugly violence or just fight flying between anti-Trump supporters.
[00:23:06.323 --> 00:23:09.406]  Yeah, I want to wind up to some very violent footage.
[00:23:11.567 --> 00:23:19.413]  Organizers say today's rally of unity against what they cringe allegedly to be a FedEx delivery to put an end to the protest.
[00:23:19.433 --> 00:23:22.415]  Just to strike the numbers that come at you, you might be up to a hundred units.
[00:23:23.877 --> 00:23:29.240]  Believe me, we've copped and we'll beco- He's not your president and you shouldn't bring us to it!
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.040]  This is the heart of sex.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.582]  We're here with a very important body out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:23:34.602 --> 00:23:38.204]  Beyond being prepared, we must have the good dine or we will die.
[00:23:38.564 --> 00:23:41.285]  And thyroid problems and all the- of all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:23:41.706 --> 00:23:44.147]  And a lot of just mainline back to iodine oven.
[00:23:44.787 --> 00:23:46.768]  It's as important if you don't get iodine.
[00:23:46.788 --> 00:23:48.189]  People are just deficient, so they're low.
[00:23:48.349 --> 00:23:49.590]  You gotta have iodine in your body.
[00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.631]  Use the hormones you need.
[00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:50.951]  Itch.
[00:23:51.151 --> 00:23:52.011]  To so many things.
[00:23:52.051 --> 00:23:56.134]  And some years ago, we've helped iodine by developing deep earth crystals.
[00:23:56.254 --> 00:23:57.575]  For me, of the purest.
[00:23:57.815 --> 00:24:00.537]  Other iodine comes from the O products of chemical facilities.
[00:24:00.617 --> 00:24:01.637]  It's- it's- it's bound.
[00:24:01.697 --> 00:24:02.418]  It's- I tried it.
[00:24:02.978 --> 00:24:10.159]  And I'm a dirty iodine, because the Bob Iodine, it absorbs the cl- all these other bad howler family of favor, and shove iodine for your sake.
[00:24:10.239 --> 00:24:14.580]  And whatever you do, civil of Survival Shield, they still consult your physician because of your issues.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.161]  It can have some- and most folks I talk to, it's a column, but still, cuz iodine is no joke.
[00:24:19.201 --> 00:24:19.521]  It's a key.
[00:24:19.561 --> 00:24:23.401]  I haven't had it for a long time, and say they've experienced things in effect and things like that.
[00:24:23.522 --> 00:24:24.802]  You've gotta have iodine to live.
[00:24:24.822 --> 00:24:26.162]  You got it on this key, you must have it.
[00:24:26.382 --> 00:24:26.482]  Pshh.
[00:24:26.842 --> 00:24:30.643]  Before you get Pison Iodine X2, or call toll free, we can answer your 253-313-
[00:24:32.748 --> 00:24:36.873]  A farmer point eight million dollar owing his fields.
[00:24:37.153 --> 00:24:37.574]  2.8 fields.
[00:24:37.614 --> 00:24:38.355]  What was he growing?
[00:24:38.595 --> 00:24:39.857]  He was growing wheat.
[00:24:40.057 --> 00:24:42.700]  From a war on drugs on farmers grow.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.341]  I'll tell you how.
[00:24:43.361 --> 00:24:46.945]  We're gonna talk about this for this first but you have to understand here and where we already are.
[00:24:47.746 --> 00:24:52.371]  The old story had to run to hunt in the four owned all the land and
[00:24:53.112 --> 00:24:54.994]  And they would have a dictatorship.
[00:24:55.394 --> 00:24:56.275]  And the dictatorship.
[00:24:56.295 --> 00:24:56.656]  Let's see.
[00:24:56.676 --> 00:24:57.817]  Let's look at what happened.
[00:24:57.837 --> 00:24:59.218]  Her face is trial in federal court.
[00:24:59.419 --> 00:25:02.822]  This summer and a two-poiling to get a permit to plant wheat.
[00:25:03.242 --> 00:25:07.366]  Duarte Nursery said because it could set a precedent requiring other farmer.
[00:25:07.987 --> 00:25:09.627]  Time consumes to plow.
[00:25:09.787 --> 00:25:11.808]  Their attorney says the case is thereof.
[00:25:12.368 --> 00:25:13.248]  Uh, that the U.S.
[00:25:13.348 --> 00:25:15.088]  Army Corps of Engineers to grow crops.
[00:25:15.128 --> 00:25:17.049]  This is an attorney for the Pacific.
[00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:19.689]  He said we're not going under those kinds of regulations.
[00:25:19.749 --> 00:25:20.629]  Trial already.
[00:25:20.949 --> 00:25:22.950]  Suck about whether or not it's a judge.
[00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:23.250]  U.S.
[00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.270]  District Judge agreed with the Army Corps of Engineers.
[00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.690]  Uh, back at a penalty.
[00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.211]  They're talking about 2.8 million dollar penalties.
[00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:37.192]  And understand here, we're gonna talk about the different and criminal and what that way the bureaucracy looks I don't think exists.
[00:25:37.392 --> 00:25:39.954]  Oh, this man bought 450 large area here.
[00:25:40.134 --> 00:25:41.155]  Three million dollars.
[00:25:41.596 --> 00:25:43.117]  The property has nins.
[00:25:43.357 --> 00:25:50.183]  He hired a consist of the property that were not part of drainage for creeks and were considered to be of the United States phrase.
[00:25:50.503 --> 00:25:51.944]  What they mean by of the EPA.
[00:25:52.805 --> 00:25:57.249]  taken possession of all of states and we've seen agree the details of this.
[00:25:57.689 --> 00:26:00.671]  He can cloud but he said they were not signal shallow where he is.
[00:26:01.232 --> 00:26:04.214]  And the army deleted the endangered species fairy shrimp.
[00:26:04.695 --> 00:26:05.395]  Shrimp are there.
[00:26:05.575 --> 00:26:06.236]  Okay so that's shrimp.
[00:26:06.916 --> 00:26:10.079]  The wheat was because the Army Corps of Engineers stopped.
[00:26:10.479 --> 00:26:17.104]  He sued them says constitutional right of due penalty by stopping Hibbity prior to in court and this is another time.
[00:26:17.124 --> 00:26:18.405]  We'll talk about that in a moment as well.
[00:26:18.425 --> 00:26:19.686]  So he tried to get them
[00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:24.661]  To continue on with his work, so for him, big time, act violation.
[00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:30.383]  Owing their fields are spis from the Clean Water Act rules materials in the United EPA's waters.
[00:26:30.703 --> 00:26:34.805]  Government's case is that a discharge that impairs the floor is still requires it.
[00:26:35.325 --> 00:26:38.586]  The lawyer representing reading a permit to do what he did.
[00:26:38.946 --> 00:26:41.828]  Multi-million dollar pen for thinking the laws.
[00:26:42.648 --> 00:26:43.068]  The lawyer.
[00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:43.969]  What the law says.
[00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:45.110]  They don't care what the Act says.
[00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.571]  They don't care what the United States says.
[00:26:46.631 --> 00:26:47.952]  But it gets us civil penalties.
[00:26:48.453 --> 00:26:50.995]  Also asking the judge to repair the wetlands.
[00:26:51.015 --> 00:26:52.015]  Other wetlands.
[00:26:52.296 --> 00:26:54.017]  So plans that he can then hose.
[00:26:54.477 --> 00:26:55.218]  But pay taxes.
[00:26:55.258 --> 00:26:55.718]  Analyze him.
[00:26:55.978 --> 00:26:56.959]  Give him this defeat.
[00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:57.980]  So let's look.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.181]  There's no Dupre.
[00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:00.782]  They're saying that they're taking AC.
[00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:02.604]  Just as we see civil drug war.
[00:27:03.184 --> 00:27:04.825]  And because it was.
[00:27:05.746 --> 00:27:06.306]  It hasn't.
[00:27:06.386 --> 00:27:08.867]  But we continue with S-stopped as a rule of law.
[00:27:08.907 --> 00:27:15.650]  And on to the civil asset for- That because this- The government could- Your property, even with- Let alone finding you guilty.
[00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.570]  Thing is civil.
[00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.391]  EPA or the IRS.
[00:27:18.411 --> 00:27:19.771]  Remember we just had the FAA.
[00:27:19.911 --> 00:27:22.272]  Half ago, just before Chris 15, I'm going on memory.
[00:27:22.472 --> 00:27:25.254]  Careful, you, all you people who are sure that you have registered.
[00:27:25.614 --> 00:27:30.016]  It's not going to be much, but if we catch you using it, registered it, fine of 25.
[00:27:30.877 --> 00:27:32.077]  Does that seem excessive?
[00:27:32.157 --> 00:27:33.378]  It's, but they can get away.
[00:27:33.498 --> 00:27:41.342]  You don't have any right to do prospers, to see what you're accused of, to call and have a right to a jury trial, or a right to excessive fines.
[00:27:41.522 --> 00:27:45.885]  Now say no, we're not gonna let the, and that every one of the other federal agencies, you.
[00:27:46.963 --> 00:27:47.344]  ...and swish.
[00:27:47.824 --> 00:27:50.027]  Without any dupe, and it's because it's a civil.
[00:27:50.488 --> 00:27:52.050]  There's also an excessive fines.
[00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.630]  The ID.
[00:27:52.831 --> 00:27:53.532]  Extra wetlands.
[00:27:53.572 --> 00:27:55.775]  Just a whole million dollar penalty in the Z acres.
[00:27:57.711 --> 00:27:59.932]  And the fact that you violate the letter of the law, come after him.
[00:27:59.952 --> 00:28:01.213]  You're deprecated.
[00:28:01.774 --> 00:28:03.155]  They create federal bureaucrats.
[00:28:03.195 --> 00:28:03.935]  They cut laws.
[00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:05.536]  The Congress creates bureaucracies.
[00:28:06.077 --> 00:28:06.757]  And they cut the laws.
[00:28:07.117 --> 00:28:08.878]  The bureaucrats are the judge.
[00:28:08.998 --> 00:28:10.319]  In the sense of the fine.
[00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:11.460]  Law is in their mouth.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:11.900]  It is.
[00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:13.782]  And why wouldn't they thank the Constitution?
[00:28:14.402 --> 00:28:15.663]  Stand before the voters.
[00:28:15.683 --> 00:28:16.563]  It's representation.
[00:28:16.784 --> 00:28:17.904]  And it is representation.
[00:28:18.565 --> 00:28:18.805]  Stop.

[00:28:51.264 --> 00:28:53.806]  How are they going to keep us where we can't grow food?
[00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:54.727]  It's quiet.
[00:28:55.428 --> 00:29:02.616]  With a universal basic income, we can totally grow our own food, have our own jobs, and then be completely dependent.
[00:29:03.076 --> 00:29:05.960]  That is why basic income is a variable of dependency.

[00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.210]  Something clever like face.
[00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:20.011]  So dearly, the dollars like Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:29:20.031 --> 00:29:25.494]  This is the dependency, the building around us, and do not respect the true setup to protect.
[00:29:25.774 --> 00:29:26.954]  Well that's it for tonight's news.
