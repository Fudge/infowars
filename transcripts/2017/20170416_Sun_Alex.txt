[00:00:12.463 --> 00:00:16.807]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:24.933]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:28.896]  Riders on the storm!
[00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:34.521]  Make no mistake... You may try to stay out of the storm of your life, but...
[00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:44.047]  That puts you in the most dangerous waters, because then you never strive, you never build, you never get challenged.
[00:00:44.047 --> 00:01:00.612]  And in those doldrums of rotting foam, in those back-channel eddies, your whole destiny basically dies in mediocrity and stagnation.
[00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:02.332]  The world in 2017 is at a great crossroads.
[00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:20.090]  And I am here on Friday afternoon taping a few intros to a big, important rebroadcast we have with some of the best interviews the last few months with Michael Savage and others, Daniel Esselstyn, you name it.
[00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.412]  And I'm just hoping, and I'm pretty sure in my heart, we won't have nuclear war by the time this broadcast is going out.
[00:01:27.423 --> 00:01:33.289]  Trump has said that if North Korea keeps threatening to attack Japan or South Korea and fires missiles, they may shoot down those missiles.
[00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.732]  They do a nuclear test on the grandfather's birthday.
[00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:37.413]  He's been dead for 30, 40 years.
[00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:43.039]  It's a hundred and something birthday that they will strike out as well.
[00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.564]  But finally, China, South Korea, Japan, the United States are all tired of North Korea's behavior.
[00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:57.308]  You'll never hear this if there's actually a big attack, because it'll probably cause some chain reaction, or I'll definitely be here live, responding to whatever happens.
[00:01:57.308 --> 00:02:00.550]  So, this is really a celebration.
[00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:12.515]  The fact this is on air, that if you're seeing this on Sunday, and it's taped, it means I'm with my children, having an Easter dinner, and you're with your children, your family, having an Easter dinner as well.
[00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.757]  You know, and I've always been brought up a Christian, and I love God, but I never really pushed my Christianity like Islamists has pushed theirs or others.
[00:02:21.757 --> 00:02:27.582]  But I had a guest on earlier last week, Doug Hagman, who said it's time for Christians to stop being so tolerant.
[00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:35.329]  You know, we're tolerant of everybody else, but they're not tolerant of us, so we're so tolerant we give up our culture that unifies us to make them happy.
[00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:35.970]  It doesn't make them happy.
[00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:50.489]  And I'm sorry that Christians everywhere build the best civilizations, the best secure countries, the biggest social safety networks, the most liberal systems, and then you use that very liberalism that we created to piss all over it.
[00:02:50.489 --> 00:03:02.555]  Because whether you have a Anglo-Saxon background, or a Hispanic background, or an Asian background, or an Arabic background, or a whatever it is, if you're a Christian,
[00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:08.483]  That unifies you together on do unto others as you have them do unto you.
[00:03:08.483 --> 00:03:09.764]  And the Golden Rule.
[00:03:09.764 --> 00:03:12.467]  And people say, oh, look at this in the Bible or that.
[00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:13.108]  Okay.
[00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:17.033]  But no one denies Christian countries are the most prosperous and the most free.
[00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:21.338]  So I'm not going to sit here and hear you piss all over Christianity anymore.
[00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.683]  And I'm not going to sit here like some phony establishment preacher who wouldn't use the term piss on you.
[00:03:27.683 --> 00:03:29.625]  Or people who say don't use the Lord's name in vain.
[00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:31.246]  That's what some preacher defined it.
[00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:36.711]  When I say God damn the New World Order to hell, I mean I want God to damn them to hell.
[00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:38.773]  That's not taking God's name in vain.
[00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:42.716]  I'm asking God to deliver us from these people.
[00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:43.897]  I'm asking for fire.
[00:03:43.897 --> 00:03:50.382]  Like Ezekiel called down from heaven against the enemies.
[00:03:50.382 --> 00:03:51.023]  Or Elijah.
[00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:54.254]  I want them damned to hell!
[00:03:54.254 --> 00:04:08.668]  Not because I'm in a physical war with them and want to see them hurt from some psychopathic perspective, but because they're waging war against us, and I've had enough of the New World Order, and the devil worshippers, and the pedophiles, and the radical Islamists, and all the other cults.
[00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:09.589]  I want them out of my way.
[00:04:12.332 --> 00:04:14.153]  Because I'm a lover, not a fighter.
[00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.335]  But I'm tired of lovers being such lovers.
[00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:20.777]  We roll over and realize if we're real lovers, we gotta be fighters.
[00:04:20.777 --> 00:04:23.219]  Because the greatest fighters are the lovers.
[00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.720]  We're not fighters, but we're willing to fight because we love people.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.223]  And when we fight, it's much stronger.
[00:04:29.223 --> 00:04:37.108]  So on this Easter Sunday, as Christ rose from the dead after three days like Lazarus, I call on the human spirit.
[00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:40.326]  The spirit, the life force, Christ.
[00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:42.629]  God's spirit in us, the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:43.750]  We're made in the image of God.
[00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.675]  Christ is that archetype of what we can build towards to move upon the face of the world.
[00:04:48.675 --> 00:04:51.858]  Let the spirit of evil in 2017 be broken.
[00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:53.880]  Then we all pray that together.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.044]  A big hour coming up and I'll come back with one more transmission at the start of the next hour.
[00:04:58.044 --> 00:04:58.965]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.367]  Infowars.com is that censored website.
[00:05:06.414 --> 00:05:07.795]  Wash the board is clear.
[00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:13.076]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:20.379]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.560]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.442]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:34.224]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:42.311]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:50.618]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[00:05:50.618 --> 00:05:58.906]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:21.616]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:25.597]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.597 --> 00:06:29.098]  Well, Ron Paul has come out and said it was a false flag chemical attack.
[00:06:29.098 --> 00:06:34.660]  The former top British ambassador has come out and said that it was a false flag attack.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.841]  Peter Ford, he said now the jihadis will launch more false flags and draw Trump in.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:52.787]  Vladimir Putin has come out and said it, but it hasn't gotten any attention like Michael Savage, best-selling author, probably the number one or number two talk show host in the United States, coming on the broadcast right now exclusively.
[00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:57.189]  In about an hour, he hosts his own broadcast, despite the fact he's under the weather.
[00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.451]  His new best-selling book, Trump's War, warns on page 233.
[00:07:01.932 --> 00:07:08.096]  Trump's war against the deep state and he warns in the chapter, I read the book a month ago, of them trying to get him into war.
[00:07:08.096 --> 00:07:10.378]  So, that's why they call him Dr. Savage.
[00:07:10.378 --> 00:07:18.083]  I won't go into all his degrees, medical degrees, you name it, but exclusively joins us here, Zero Hedge, Drudge Report has it.
[00:07:18.823 --> 00:07:22.665]  Michael Savage turns on Trump, says Syrian gas attack was false flag.
[00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:25.727]  I don't think it's turning on Trump, it's warning Trump.
[00:07:25.727 --> 00:07:28.949]  Maybe I'm wrong, but CNN's saying he's turned on Trump.
[00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:37.254]  I don't want to put words in his mouth, I haven't gotten his total view on this, but Dr. Savage of michaelsavage.com, am I wrong to say you haven't turned, you're desperate?
[00:07:37.254 --> 00:07:41.957]  That's the vermin in the left, trying to divide and conquer once again.
[00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:46.520]  It's the garbage of the world in the media.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.061]  The trash, the filth.
[00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:49.807]  The sludge!
[00:07:49.807 --> 00:07:51.588]  I never turned on Trump.
[00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:53.149]  Now, I don't know whether we can reach Trump.
[00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:54.110]  That's the problem.
[00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.230]  I don't know who he's listening to.
[00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.134]  Well, I did talk to, let's just say, I did get what the President thought this week, and I'll tell you later.
[00:08:00.134 --> 00:08:04.337]  I know you just had dinner with him a few weeks ago, but let's just, you've got the floor, sir.
[00:08:04.337 --> 00:08:06.938]  So just roll this out, why you're so concerned.
[00:08:06.938 --> 00:08:09.320]  We're not the only ones who see this.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.242]  Let's start with all the people you mentioned, but let's go the other way.
[00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:13.263]  Who is supporting this?
[00:08:14.023 --> 00:08:17.066]  The worst people on the planet are saluting Trump.
[00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:20.389]  Tariq Zachariah, Mr. Crazy Eyes.
[00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:23.551]  Lindsey Graham, the weirdest man in the history of the Senate.
[00:08:23.551 --> 00:08:28.395]  John McCain, the psycho when he speaks you can see insanity.
[00:08:28.395 --> 00:08:30.037]  They're all saluting Donald Trump.
[00:08:30.037 --> 00:08:32.199]  These are the people we hated before the election.
[00:08:32.882 --> 00:08:35.605]  These are the people who were rejected during the election.
[00:08:35.605 --> 00:08:46.774]  Now they're on Trump's side, along with the crypto pseudo-conservatives in the radio business who hold themselves up as great conservatives who are screaming for war?
[00:08:46.774 --> 00:08:49.337]  Alex, the world is upside down.
[00:08:49.337 --> 00:08:54.061]  If you can keep your head while all those around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, then you'll be a man my son.
[00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:58.785]  One of the greatest lines ever written, something I've carried with me since I'm 18 years old.
[00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:04.758]  If you can keep your head and all those around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, then you'll be a man, my son.
[00:09:04.758 --> 00:09:08.880]  Alex, we are being tested like we have never been tested before.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:17.305]  I don't know how we come out of this, because I don't know if Donald Trump is listening to a word anyone is saying to him other than this, this inner cadre around him.
[00:09:17.305 --> 00:09:19.707]  Somebody has turned him.
[00:09:19.707 --> 00:09:22.128]  Now, let's look at the big picture.
[00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:28.332]  In a period of only one week, because of a few propaganda photos of a terrible tragedy,
[00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:37.675]  Conducted by we don't know whom, the president has now launched wars and threatened wars against three nations.
[00:09:37.675 --> 00:09:39.955]  China, Russia, North Korea.
[00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:41.636]  But more than that, did you see?
[00:09:41.636 --> 00:09:44.456]  Alex, here's the strangest part of it all.
[00:09:44.456 --> 00:09:54.018]  For a smart man, why would he conduct these absurd, limp-wristed missile strikes while the Chinese guests are sitting with him at Mar-a-Lago?
[00:09:54.952 --> 00:09:56.813]  Does anyone not understand protocol?
[00:09:56.813 --> 00:09:58.734]  Do they not understand diplomacy?
[00:09:58.734 --> 00:10:03.877]  Do they understand that's probably one of the greatest breaches of diplomacy I've ever seen in my lifetime?
[00:10:03.877 --> 00:10:08.439]  This was like saying to the Chinese, hello, small, stupid men with shiny heads.
[00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:09.700]  Are you enjoying my meal?
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.081]  Well, F you, because I've just launched missiles.
[00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:13.742]  Now what do you have to say about it?
[00:10:13.742 --> 00:10:16.484]  What kind of presidency is this?
[00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:17.704]  I'll agree.
[00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:18.045]  I'll agree.
[00:10:18.045 --> 00:10:20.306]  It's very, very, very provocative.
[00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.651]  Well, you're being more diplomatic than I, which is saying an awful lot.
[00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:27.833]  Maybe it's because I have the flu and I have a fever and I'm not thinking clearly.
[00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:29.154]  No, you're thinking very clearly.
[00:10:29.154 --> 00:10:37.297]  In fact, every veteran I talk to, every person I talk to, I'd say 85% of the audience is absolutely freaked out about what's happening.
[00:10:37.297 --> 00:10:39.618]  And I'll tell you who, you know who he listens to.
[00:10:39.618 --> 00:10:41.299]  I'll tell you who Trump listens to.
[00:10:41.299 --> 00:10:43.340]  Late at night, they've taken his phone away.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.161]  They only let negative stuff go on Twitter.
[00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:46.842]  He doesn't get any positive comments there.
[00:10:46.842 --> 00:10:47.842]  He would do feedback there.
[00:10:47.842 --> 00:10:49.003]  He listens to Michael Savage.
[00:10:49.423 --> 00:10:54.274]  He listens to Infowars, he looks at Drudge Report, probably more than us combined, let's just say it.
[00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:55.437]  So... Alex, hold on.
[00:10:55.437 --> 00:10:57.261]  How does he listen to me if I'm off in the air?
[00:10:59.005 --> 00:11:01.547]  He goes and finds clips on YouTube, I know for a fact.
[00:11:01.547 --> 00:11:05.751]  The point is, the point is, is that he does listen to you.
[00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:12.077]  I got a phone call this weekend from somebody, I'll just leave it at that, saying we're not going to do a no-fly zone, we're not going to have war.
[00:11:12.077 --> 00:11:14.439]  Rex Tillerson's going to come out and dial this back.
[00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:17.481]  Some people have been speaking on their own, and notice Tillerson's now done that.
[00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:19.783]  I said that Sunday, I said that Monday, it's now happened.
[00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:23.547]  I don't want to sit here and brag and try to sound big, but just, he is listening to you.
[00:11:23.547 --> 00:11:24.928]  So speak directly to the President, go ahead.
[00:11:25.942 --> 00:11:27.224]  Oh my God.
[00:11:27.224 --> 00:11:28.585]  Well hello, President Trump.
[00:11:28.585 --> 00:11:32.869]  You said I should live another 25 years when you put your arm around me at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:11:32.869 --> 00:11:37.754]  I hope you mean it because I can use another 25 minutes the way I feel.
[00:11:37.754 --> 00:11:38.995]  My feeling is this.
[00:11:38.995 --> 00:11:40.637]  Tillerson is misleading you.
[00:11:40.637 --> 00:11:44.361]  I have no idea why people don't see through that man.
[00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:49.086]  It seems to me that it's so plain that you don't have to be a genius to see what happened here.
[00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:56.804]  What does Exxon Mobil gain if they cut Syria out of the gas lines that are running out of the Middle East to Europe?
[00:11:56.804 --> 00:12:01.028]  What does Exxon Mobil gain by that, Alex?
[00:12:01.028 --> 00:12:02.849]  That's the whole story in a nutshell.
[00:12:02.849 --> 00:12:04.671]  It's another war for oil.
[00:12:04.671 --> 00:12:05.612]  It's all over again.
[00:12:05.612 --> 00:12:07.793]  It's the same thing as 1999.
[00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:12.417]  Remember when Bill Clinton was mercilessly bombing the Serbian people?
[00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:13.338]  Yes.
[00:12:13.338 --> 00:12:13.959]  For the Muslims.
[00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:17.642]  I read an article in 1999, the oily tracks run through Kosovo.
[00:12:17.642 --> 00:12:19.163]  It was a little-noticed article.
[00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:26.944]  My heart was broken because Bill Clinton engaged in 78 of the worst days of my life until now.
[00:12:26.944 --> 00:12:31.005]  Where Bill Clinton mercilessly bombed Serbia.
[00:12:31.005 --> 00:12:33.066]  He blew up hospitals.
[00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:34.806]  He blew up train stations.
[00:12:34.806 --> 00:12:37.487]  He blew up every bridge on the Danube River.
[00:12:37.487 --> 00:12:38.887]  For one reason.
[00:12:38.887 --> 00:12:42.248]  And that was to steal Kosovo from the Serbs.
[00:12:42.248 --> 00:12:46.209]  To permit an oil pipeline to run through Kosovo.
[00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:48.090]  What's even worse about that story is
[00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:53.114]  The same exact elements that are now on the side of war were on the side of war then.
[00:12:53.114 --> 00:13:03.808]  And the same sane people and rational people who cared for the stability of the Earth, for the stability of their families, were against that insane act by Bill Clinton.
[00:13:04.748 --> 00:13:06.509]  I have not changed my position.
[00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:07.769]  It's the same exact thing.
[00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:18.872]  We cannot let crazed businessmen, who put their bottom line ahead of the survival of the planet, and I'm talking about Rex Tillerson, to rule this nation.
[00:13:18.872 --> 00:13:20.472]  Did you vote for Rex Tillerson?
[00:13:20.472 --> 00:13:20.872]  No.
[00:13:20.872 --> 00:13:23.193]  With his name on the **** ballot?
[00:13:23.193 --> 00:13:23.833]  No.
[00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:25.833]  Did you ever hear of that pro-Magnon?
[00:13:25.833 --> 00:13:27.634]  No.
[00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:30.635]  Who ever heard of that throwback?
[00:13:30.635 --> 00:13:31.495]  Where did he come from?
[00:13:32.992 --> 00:13:34.813]  Where the hell did that throwback come from?
[00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:35.934]  That lowbrow.
[00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:40.436]  Looks like he crawled out of a pit somewhere.
[00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:42.237]  We can say all the things we want.
[00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:45.499]  I did not elect him to the presidency.
[00:13:45.499 --> 00:13:47.100]  I didn't kill myself for a year.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.221]  I have total faith in Donald Trump.
[00:13:49.221 --> 00:13:51.403]  And I'll repeat right now what I said to him.
[00:13:51.403 --> 00:13:53.984]  I would do anything for that man.
[00:13:53.984 --> 00:13:55.065]  I have total faith in him.
[00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:59.918]  But I don't understand how he cannot see through all the president's men.
[00:13:59.918 --> 00:14:01.762]  They're misleading him.
[00:14:01.762 --> 00:14:03.885]  They're taking him down a road he cannot come back from.
[00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:08.453]  Absolutely, that's why my... If he loses you and he loses me, tell me what happens next.
[00:14:10.029 --> 00:14:14.130]  That they'll destroy him, and he has to know that his base is upset, but let's expand on that.
[00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:30.454]  The British ambassador, and I want to ask you this question, to Syria, said, listen, it's not that Assad's perfect, we're on the side of al-Qaeda and ISIS, they're celebrating this, they're going to stage more stuff, they got caught in 2013, they got caught last year, it's official, they videotaped it, these jihadis want to be rock stars,
[00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:33.678]  They videotaped launching the chemical attacks.
[00:14:33.678 --> 00:14:38.465]  It wasn't sarin, it was chlorine gas, because the doctors are taking care of them without gloves.
[00:14:38.465 --> 00:14:40.547]  And Putin has come out and said it's a false flag.
[00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:45.554]  And he says more is planned, and that's what the British ambassador and Putin, who are smart, are saying is.
[00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:47.116]  We don't want war.
[00:14:47.116 --> 00:14:48.617]  We want to de-escalate this.
[00:14:48.617 --> 00:15:04.231]  What are you going to do now, Trump, when the jihadis stage more stuff, this time in Aleppo or in the suburbs of Damascus, and then the right-wing, left-wing neocons, whatever you want to call them, rhinos, the warmongers like McCain and Graham, say, President, you've got to do something.
[00:15:04.231 --> 00:15:05.693]  They have painted him into a corner.
[00:15:07.213 --> 00:15:11.777]  What more do you need to know than the crazy eyes of him?
[00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:15.480]  Let's look at the man with the craziest, most deceitful eyes in media.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.881]  Zacharias.
[00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:19.844]  Zachariah, one of the sickest looking faces I've ever seen.
[00:15:19.844 --> 00:15:25.729]  If you were to create a puppet of deceit and hatred for America, it would be Fareed Zachariah.
[00:15:25.729 --> 00:15:26.549]  Yeah, Fareed Zachariah.
[00:15:26.549 --> 00:15:29.212]  Congratulating Donald Trump.
[00:15:29.212 --> 00:15:33.195]  Lindsey Graham, one of the most twisted sisters in the history of the Senate.
[00:15:33.195 --> 00:15:35.477]  A totally twisted Nancy.
[00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.532]  He's now encouraged by the Trump administration.
[00:15:39.532 --> 00:15:50.538]  John McCain, who looks like what he is, a totally sad, broken man, walking around like the puppet of the defense establishment, saluting him.
[00:15:50.538 --> 00:15:52.299]  And listen to this, Alex.
[00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:55.841]  Again, you don't have to be a genius to add up the pieces.
[00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:58.943]  All of the Never Trumpers, the Weekly Standard crowd,
[00:16:00.331 --> 00:16:02.373]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[00:16:02.373 --> 00:16:03.854]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[00:16:03.854 --> 00:16:06.477]  We've had an Easter Special, and I've decided to extend for another week.
[00:16:06.477 --> 00:16:09.541]  It is a great, empowering thing for me, personally.
[00:16:09.541 --> 00:16:10.722]  Big Interglobalist onslaught.
[00:16:10.722 --> 00:16:14.766]  And as the enemy turns up the wattage, every action has an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.348]  God, or the good force of the universe,
[00:16:16.428 --> 00:16:17.809]  Turns up my power.
[00:16:17.809 --> 00:16:18.669]  So let me explain something.
[00:16:18.669 --> 00:16:20.470]  This is a great voyage I'm on.
[00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:21.671]  And I know you're on it with me.
[00:16:21.671 --> 00:16:26.234]  The animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is the paramount vehicle.
[00:16:26.234 --> 00:16:28.075]  This whole world is a test.
[00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:31.156]  And this experiment that we're all part of is key.
[00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:33.218]  You're conscious and alive and you care.
[00:16:33.218 --> 00:16:40.642]  And the fact that you're even involved and are even searching for the truth shows you're conscious and haven't been pulled under by these dark forces that now dominate our world.
[00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:46.085]  So whether you get our great products and support the broadcast, whether you pray for us, whether you just spread the word about the links, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:46.085 --> 00:16:50.047]  Just being conscious and awake connects us all together, and this is an incredible moment to be alive.
[00:16:50.047 --> 00:16:59.292]  So I'm Alex Jones for the entire InfoWars.com family, InfoWarsLive.com saluting all of you, no matter what color your skin is, where you came from in the world, or what your religious background is, we are unstoppable together.

[00:19:00.783 --> 00:19:06.227]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:19:06.227 --> 00:19:08.329]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:13.632]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:19:13.632 --> 00:19:17.375]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[00:19:17.475 --> 00:19:20.918]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:19:20.918 --> 00:19:24.100]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.984]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:19:27.984 --> 00:19:35.149]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:40.534]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:19:40.694 --> 00:19:42.014]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:21.238 --> 00:20:24.200]  I was afraid this day might come.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.124]  But it takes a strong man to make peace and a weak man to make war.
[00:20:29.124 --> 00:20:33.988]  It is not a mark of strength to go to war, especially when our military is depleted.
[00:20:33.988 --> 00:20:35.829]  Now let's look at that.
[00:20:35.829 --> 00:20:37.670]  We all know the military is depleted.
[00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.792]  The President knows that.
[00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:40.433]  And now what?
[00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:45.036]  We're threatening China and Russia and North Korea at once?
[00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:48.799]  When half our planes, our aircraft carriers are inoperable?
[00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:51.763]  What in the hell is going on here?
[00:20:51.763 --> 00:20:53.564]  Who is leading here?
[00:20:53.564 --> 00:20:56.386]  Who is making these decisions?
[00:20:56.386 --> 00:21:00.189]  I want to say something on a strictly commercial level.
[00:21:00.189 --> 00:21:09.757]  My book, Trump's War, became number one on the New York Times bestseller list, Alex, with zero appearance on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News.
[00:21:09.757 --> 00:21:11.138]  Never mind all of the other channels.
[00:21:11.138 --> 00:21:12.399]  That shows the decline of their power.
[00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:19.821]  Not only the decline of their power, Alex, I went on your show, drudge linked it, that was all I needed.
[00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:20.181]  Why?
[00:21:20.181 --> 00:21:22.463]  I don't need a new car.
[00:21:22.463 --> 00:21:24.644]  I'm not looking to buy a new car.
[00:21:24.644 --> 00:21:25.885]  I'm looking to save the nation.
[00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:27.346]  You want to change the world.
[00:21:27.346 --> 00:21:28.667]  You love your children, just like I do.
[00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:30.208]  It fundamentally pisses you off.
[00:21:30.208 --> 00:21:30.628]  Exactly.
[00:21:30.628 --> 00:21:31.349]  And what does that tell you?
[00:21:31.349 --> 00:21:32.550]  I go on Fox.
[00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.051]  They still had me on a few times.
[00:21:34.051 --> 00:21:35.592]  They wanted me to do a show and stuff.
[00:21:35.592 --> 00:21:36.353]  No response.
[00:21:36.353 --> 00:21:37.513]  I go on your show.
[00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:38.974]  You play a clip of my show.
[00:21:38.974 --> 00:21:40.536]  You have Paul Watson on.
[00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:42.377]  We get millions of people visiting the site.
[00:21:42.617 --> 00:21:44.638]  I know you get that with us, because we're the real media.
[00:21:44.638 --> 00:21:46.419]  And here's the problem, Dr. Savage.
[00:21:46.419 --> 00:21:48.461]  Google has banned us off Google Ads.
[00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:51.482]  David Brock is bragging that they've got all these people boycotting all our sponsors.
[00:21:51.482 --> 00:21:52.743]  We've lost almost all of them.
[00:21:52.743 --> 00:21:54.044]  We thank God we sell our own products.
[00:21:54.044 --> 00:21:56.185]  And I'm not bitching the audience, but here's the deal.
[00:21:56.185 --> 00:22:00.708]  Just like your book on China got banned from distribution, we are under attack.
[00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:03.209]  Do folks know that we have the big audience?
[00:22:03.209 --> 00:22:04.610]  We're fighting.
[00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:07.492]  And the listeners need to know we're not the types to whine.
[00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:08.793]  But my God, are we getting censored?
[00:22:10.442 --> 00:22:15.545]  Alex, again, talking commercially because a lot of people listening who don't know these things.
[00:22:15.545 --> 00:22:18.407]  The ratings just came out in streaming radio shows.
[00:22:18.407 --> 00:22:25.091]  My show is number one in the country, beating the great Rush Limbaugh by a huge number.
[00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:26.191]  On a bunch of platforms.
[00:22:26.191 --> 00:22:27.912]  Rush Limbaugh.
[00:22:27.912 --> 00:22:29.573]  Let's talk about him for a minute.
[00:22:29.573 --> 00:22:32.055]  How in the world does this man not understand what he sounds like?
[00:22:34.798 --> 00:22:35.479]  It's very sad.
[00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.504]  Well, I tuned in the other day and I thought he was saying he was against it.
[00:22:38.504 --> 00:22:39.906]  Then he said, oh, I'm playing Devil's Advocate.
[00:22:39.906 --> 00:22:41.669]  Then he did an hour for it.
[00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:43.572]  And I just, I just, I don't want to see him.
[00:22:43.572 --> 00:22:45.075]  I'm not even talking about him.
[00:22:45.075 --> 00:22:48.901]  It's sad to watch a clown like that fall off the high wire.
[00:22:49.773 --> 00:22:52.736]  Alex, what are we going to do to get our message across to Donald Trump?
[00:22:52.736 --> 00:22:54.378]  Does he even care what we have to say?
[00:22:54.378 --> 00:22:56.701]  Let me tell you, he listens.
[00:22:56.701 --> 00:22:58.282]  The problem is... Why don't we ask him?
[00:22:58.282 --> 00:23:00.405]  If you have access, I don't.
[00:23:00.405 --> 00:23:03.748]  I live out in Nowhereville, way on the West Coast.
[00:23:03.748 --> 00:23:04.830]  No one cares what I think.
[00:23:05.814 --> 00:23:13.338]  I guarantee you if I tell Trump you want to meet him in Mar-a-Lago next weekend, quite frankly, I was with a family trip in Hawaii.
[00:23:13.338 --> 00:23:14.379]  The media goes crazy with this.
[00:23:14.379 --> 00:23:15.680]  I'm not going to get into it.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.080]  But let's just say I could have gone.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.381]  I just literally was family.
[00:23:18.381 --> 00:23:19.642]  I just couldn't do it.
[00:23:19.642 --> 00:23:22.704]  But believe me, sir, he absolutely loves you.
[00:23:22.704 --> 00:23:23.824]  And you know that.
[00:23:23.824 --> 00:23:25.005]  You already had dinner with him.
[00:23:25.005 --> 00:23:28.667]  If you want to go visit Trump, I mean, you can snap your fingers.
[00:23:28.667 --> 00:23:30.388]  I'll make a phone call and it'll happen.
[00:23:30.908 --> 00:23:32.790]  Well, I don't want to snap fingers.
[00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.811]  No, I don't mean that arrogantly.
[00:23:34.811 --> 00:23:36.673]  I'm just saying he'd love to meet with you.
[00:23:36.673 --> 00:23:39.555]  I would love to visit him, not in Mar-a-Lago, but in the White House.
[00:23:39.555 --> 00:23:41.096]  That's what I would like to do.
[00:23:41.096 --> 00:23:43.278]  And I would fly across the country.
[00:23:43.278 --> 00:23:44.899]  I'm getting over the flu right now.
[00:23:44.899 --> 00:23:48.422]  I fought it off with my own nutrients, by the way.
[00:23:48.422 --> 00:23:50.143]  I haven't had the opportunity of taking yours.
[00:23:50.143 --> 00:23:52.385]  I'll tell you the truth, I could use some of that selenium right now.
[00:23:52.385 --> 00:23:53.086]  I'm pretty depleted.
[00:23:53.086 --> 00:23:56.088]  I feel like a depleted uranium shell.
[00:23:56.088 --> 00:23:57.909]  You've been working hard at 75.
[00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:59.971]  A depleted uranium shell, Alex.
[00:24:02.561 --> 00:24:08.504]  Uh, look, people think this is a joke and they think we do this just for effects or books.
[00:24:08.504 --> 00:24:12.046]  Alex, I know listening to your show that your heart's in it.
[00:24:12.046 --> 00:24:15.688]  And anyone listening to me knows that my heart is in this.
[00:24:15.688 --> 00:24:20.091]  I don't know how to rescue the president from his, from his advisors.
[00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:23.252]  Something went wrong and it happened last week.
[00:24:23.252 --> 00:24:30.076]  There must be some way to sit down with him and say, please, Mr. President, please, in your vast
[00:24:31.318 --> 00:24:36.425]  Array of people who you listen to please listen to those who help make you what you are.
[00:24:36.425 --> 00:24:37.286]  We're not wrong.
[00:24:37.286 --> 00:24:39.648]  We're not crazy We're not against you.
[00:24:39.648 --> 00:24:43.373]  Why are you listening to the never Trumpers that were pretending there for you now?
[00:24:43.373 --> 00:24:47.398]  They're leading you into a blind out of which you'll never return
[00:24:47.478 --> 00:24:48.299]  And that's key!
[00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:52.564]  We're not asking for anything but freedom, and not having war, and lower taxes.
[00:24:52.564 --> 00:24:58.430]  We're not the sycophants that tried to destroy him, that he's tried to co-opt by giving power, and instead they're beginning to co-opt him.
[00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.715]  In fact, that's a key point, Dr. Savage, for me, in this segment on You've Gotta Go, is that...
[00:25:03.636 --> 00:25:04.656]  He's just surrounded.
[00:25:04.656 --> 00:25:06.977]  They have all this national security stuff.
[00:25:06.977 --> 00:25:08.737]  They took his phone away.
[00:25:08.737 --> 00:25:11.117]  They did all this other stuff in Mount Liberty to get into.
[00:25:11.117 --> 00:25:12.738]  And he took his phone away.
[00:25:12.738 --> 00:25:16.458]  They took his cell phone away, claiming it would be a violation of national security.
[00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:19.699]  And I don't know why he let him do it, because that's what he used to call me on.
[00:25:19.699 --> 00:25:20.979]  Now he calls people up.
[00:25:20.979 --> 00:25:22.319]  Priebus is on the phone.
[00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:25.460]  When Trump calls you now, Priebus goes, this is Renz Priebus.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.980]  Alex, will you talk to Trump?
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.240]  Or Roger, it's Priebus.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:28.680]  Will you talk?
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.741]  And then they sit there on the phone because he's the president.
[00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:35.363]  Sir, we have to do this to make sure Russians aren't doing it.
[00:25:35.363 --> 00:25:39.505]  They even tried to keep me from the inauguration telling Trump he's a Russian.
[00:25:39.505 --> 00:25:41.106]  They bully him with this.
[00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:45.728]  So I think he struck Syria so they stop saying the Russia thing.
[00:25:45.728 --> 00:25:53.832]  I can't go into what he did, but there's always a way out of something you do once you realize that it's not required to go down the road 100%.
[00:25:53.832 --> 00:25:55.513]  In other words, let's say it's done.
[00:25:55.513 --> 00:25:56.994]  What's done is done.
[00:25:56.994 --> 00:25:59.035]  For God's sake, stop beating the war drums.
[00:25:59.035 --> 00:26:00.496]  There are consequences to it.
[00:26:02.762 --> 00:26:06.225]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:26:06.225 --> 00:26:16.614]  A few months ago, President-elect Donald Trump told an audience during his victory tour that his administration will not take part in regime changes.
[00:26:16.614 --> 00:26:22.319]  We will stop looking to topple regimes and overthrow governments, folks.
[00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:24.840]  That was then, and this is now.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:39.825]  After the false flag chemical attack in Syria, which was blamed on Assad, the neocons and the military-industrial complex have convinced the new president that it's business as usual, and the regime changes will commence.
[00:26:39.825 --> 00:26:43.847]  My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.
[00:26:43.847 --> 00:26:50.129]  Well, the only difference is, this time, the American patriots won't be fooled again.
[00:26:50.989 --> 00:27:01.055]  I'm Darren McBrain, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:01.055 --> 00:27:07.299]  For the most part, InfoWars has not commented on the United Airlines incident because we think World War III is a bigger issue.
[00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:08.519]  But here's a take on it.
[00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:10.521]  Everyone involved is a jackass.
[00:27:10.521 --> 00:27:11.841]  Let's start with the airline.
[00:27:11.841 --> 00:27:14.043]  You couldn't raise the offer for someone to take it?
[00:27:14.043 --> 00:27:16.304]  Was $1,000 really too high for you?
[00:27:16.304 --> 00:27:19.846]  You really had a man physically removed from a flight that wasn't even overbooked?
[00:27:20.246 --> 00:27:21.107]  To the doctor.
[00:27:21.107 --> 00:27:22.608]  What the heck is wrong with you?
[00:27:22.608 --> 00:27:23.548]  How old are you?
[00:27:23.548 --> 00:27:24.949]  What did you think would happen?
[00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:27.151]  You knew they were removing you from the plane.
[00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:31.194]  Why did you then decide to act like a five-year-old who doesn't want to leave the playground?
[00:27:31.194 --> 00:27:32.575]  You did this to yourself.
[00:27:32.575 --> 00:27:33.835]  To the passengers.
[00:27:33.835 --> 00:27:43.262]  As all of you sit there in horror of what you're seeing and hearing, not one of you selfish frauds had the courage to step up and volunteer your seat, but you had plenty of courage to videotape it, didn't you?
[00:27:43.562 --> 00:27:56.173]  All in all, this man got more attention than severed children in Sweden and Yemen, China moving troops to the North Korean border, a strange naval flight path off the West Coast, or the alleged patient he so desperately had to save.
[00:27:56.173 --> 00:27:58.435]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:28:00.876 --> 00:28:09.580]  Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Syria chemical attack was a false flag, and more are on the way.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:22.607]  We have information from various sources that a similar provocation, and I can't call it anything other than a provocation, is being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the southern suburbs of Damascus.
[00:28:23.087 --> 00:28:30.513]  Where they're again preparing to release some similar chemical substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them.
[00:28:30.513 --> 00:28:41.141]  Putin went on to compare the situation in Syria to Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction, which may indicate that he believes the U.S.
[00:28:41.141 --> 00:28:45.665]  is either behind the false flag or actively pushing the propaganda.
[00:28:45.945 --> 00:28:56.788]  Meanwhile, the Russian government says Syrian forces possess no chemical weapons and any further attacks in Syria by the United States will be unacceptable.
[00:28:56.788 --> 00:29:00.289]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.809]  Not a group.
[00:29:00.809 --> 00:29:02.229]  You develop living defense for us.
[00:29:02.229 --> 00:29:03.550]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.430]  Why is this so good?
[00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:10.034]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:29:10.034 --> 00:29:15.297]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[00:29:15.297 --> 00:29:23.582]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:29:23.582 --> 00:29:29.907]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:29:29.907 --> 00:29:31.267]  These are all parasites.
[00:29:31.267 --> 00:29:31.728]  Tell us about it.
[00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:33.409]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:29:33.709 --> 00:29:38.193]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:41.476]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:29:41.476 --> 00:29:44.538]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:29:44.538 --> 00:29:45.579]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:47.521]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:29:47.521 --> 00:29:48.542]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:29:48.542 --> 00:29:51.244]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:29:51.244 --> 00:29:53.166]  And you support the broadcast.
[00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:54.507]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:29:54.507 --> 00:29:56.749]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:29:56.749 --> 00:29:58.711]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:07.004]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[00:30:07.004 --> 00:30:15.666]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[00:30:15.666 --> 00:30:23.568]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[00:30:23.568 --> 00:30:29.709]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:33.111]  NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[00:30:33.111 --> 00:30:37.813]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[00:30:37.813 --> 00:30:41.575]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[00:30:41.575 --> 00:30:44.296]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.

[00:30:58.003 --> 00:30:59.164]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:01.308 --> 00:31:03.149]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:09.753]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:31:09.753 --> 00:31:12.915]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:12.915 --> 00:31:22.700]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.541]  Caveman.
[00:31:23.541 --> 00:31:28.604]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:31:28.604 --> 00:31:30.725]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:31:31.005 --> 00:31:34.166]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:31:34.166 --> 00:31:39.307]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:31:39.307 --> 00:31:47.450]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:55.392]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:31:55.392 --> 00:32:00.033]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[00:32:00.831 --> 00:32:01.651]  Hey, everyone!
[00:32:01.651 --> 00:32:03.932]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:32:03.932 --> 00:32:07.773]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:32:07.773 --> 00:32:09.854]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:32:09.854 --> 00:32:20.137]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:32:20.137 --> 00:32:26.099]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:47.323]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.
[00:32:47.323 --> 00:32:49.304]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[00:32:49.304 --> 00:32:49.684]  Head over to
[00:32:49.844 --> 00:32:52.166]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:17.711 --> 00:33:32.808]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:33:32.808 --> 00:33:35.431]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:40.031 --> 00:33:44.493]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[00:33:44.493 --> 00:33:46.394]  We are the dealer.
[00:33:46.394 --> 00:33:50.095]  Give you everything you need.
[00:33:50.095 --> 00:33:57.979]  But what happens when the globalists break the compact with humanity and begin to cut off the resources and say development's bad?
[00:33:57.979 --> 00:33:59.119]  We have to break with them.
[00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:07.043]  Daniel Estiman, best-selling author, investigative journalist, super Bilderberg sleuth, probably Jim Tucker discovered it and exposed it, but
[00:34:07.683 --> 00:34:10.966]  Daniel Esselstyn actually penetrated and infiltrated it.
[00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:14.189]  Again, we're going to talk to him about all his amazing sources.
[00:34:14.189 --> 00:34:16.351]  I know he's got Bilderberg sources.
[00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:17.772]  I even know who their names are.
[00:34:17.772 --> 00:34:19.353]  He's given us amazing intel.
[00:34:19.353 --> 00:34:24.978]  A year and a half before the housing collapse, he said they're going to plunge the housing system in a year and a half and give the reasons.
[00:34:24.978 --> 00:34:25.939]  I mean, he's laid it all out.
[00:34:26.599 --> 00:34:33.462]  And so, DanielEsteland.com, he joins us via video Skype from Canada, where he's at right now.
[00:34:33.462 --> 00:34:35.883]  So, Daniel, great seeing you again.
[00:34:35.883 --> 00:34:36.743]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:36.743 --> 00:34:39.424]  If you're a radio listener, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:34:39.424 --> 00:34:41.205]  You can always see the video feeds, folks.
[00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:42.146]  It's free.
[00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:45.547]  Let me ask you to just set the waterfront for us here.
[00:34:45.547 --> 00:34:48.448]  I've made my points for three minutes.
[00:34:48.448 --> 00:34:49.969]  What do you want to cover today?
[00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:54.591]  I'm just guessing what you might want to cover because we're focusing on the same war that's going on.
[00:34:55.552 --> 00:34:57.417]  But what else is on your palate?
[00:34:58.304 --> 00:34:58.785]  I think.
[00:34:58.785 --> 00:35:00.105]  Alex, it's great to be back on your show.
[00:35:00.105 --> 00:35:00.546]  You're right.
[00:35:00.546 --> 00:35:01.666]  I haven't been on for about a year.
[00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:02.967]  A lot has been going on.
[00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:09.051]  And in this past few weeks, first of all, you won the very important award in Mexico.
[00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:11.793]  Just came back there from Mexico.
[00:35:11.793 --> 00:35:12.773]  Congratulations.
[00:35:12.773 --> 00:35:17.216]  First of all, NATO, Montenegro is something I want to discuss.
[00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:19.677]  Urgent issue that Americans need to understand.
[00:35:19.677 --> 00:35:25.041]  The treacherous and the treasonous attempt by the United States and the world.
[00:35:26.795 --> 00:35:31.497]  The presidency back, win the White House back, we can discuss that as well.
[00:35:31.497 --> 00:35:41.161]  I think at no time in America's prior history, Alex, has anything so openly subversive and treacherously treasonous ever been perpetuated in the United States of America before.
[00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:54.907]  I think the closest being the covert conspiracy single-handedly thwarted by America's military hero, General Smithley Butler in 1934, when a band of elitist bankers, traders attempted a coup d'etat against the FDR administration.
[00:35:55.787 --> 00:35:56.748]  We know the game.
[00:35:56.748 --> 00:36:02.170]  The all-too-familiar divide-and-conquer strategy is once again the globalist go-to modus operandi.
[00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.690]  We're seeing it right now in St.
[00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:04.571]  Petersburg.
[00:36:04.571 --> 00:36:06.031]  We're seeing it in the United States.
[00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:06.912]  We're seeing it in Europe.
[00:36:06.912 --> 00:36:08.092]  We're seeing it in Latin America.
[00:36:08.092 --> 00:36:10.233]  We're seeing it all over the world.
[00:36:10.233 --> 00:36:16.916]  And again, this is being implemented through the multi-pronged assaults waging an open insurrection war against
[00:36:17.896 --> 00:36:36.207]  Daniel, you don't like labels, but, I mean, you've been so on target over the years in your books I've read, both novels with classified stuff and both non-novels.
[00:36:36.207 --> 00:36:37.028]  Makes my head spin.
[00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:38.789]  I respect you more as the years go on.
[00:36:38.789 --> 00:36:42.992]  You're one of those maybe ten people I know that have been so on target it's actually scary.
[00:36:42.992 --> 00:36:43.872]  People think I'm on target.
[00:36:43.872 --> 00:36:44.913]  It's my guests that are on target.
[00:36:46.294 --> 00:36:48.636]  But looking at globalism, I would call you a classical liberal.
[00:36:48.636 --> 00:36:51.359]  You didn't like Bush, you don't like all this stuff, you're very liberal policies.
[00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:52.580]  I agree with a lot of those as well.
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.982]  You're a real liberal.
[00:36:54.982 --> 00:36:58.946]  We see Nigel Farage, I'd call a real liberal for Trump.
[00:36:58.946 --> 00:37:04.851]  It's not that Trump's perfect, it's just that clearly the power structure's against him, they hate him, and then you lay out St.
[00:37:04.851 --> 00:37:06.132]  Petersburg.
[00:37:06.132 --> 00:37:07.494]  What's happening there with their agenda?
[00:37:07.494 --> 00:37:08.635]  So where should we start?
[00:37:08.635 --> 00:37:09.615]  You have the real liberals.
[00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:23.764]  And then nationalists of every race, color, creed, and then you've got Republican establishment, Democratic establishment, elites, European elites, all wanting this global system, trying to prop it up, and then just, we're allied with radical Islam.
[00:37:23.764 --> 00:37:26.446]  We're not against Islam, but just radical Islam.
[00:37:26.446 --> 00:37:27.326]  Who are the players?
[00:37:27.326 --> 00:37:28.147]  Where are we right now?
[00:37:28.907 --> 00:37:33.950]  Well, Alex, the ruling elite's long-time agenda has been to destroy the United States and the West from within.
[00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:48.699]  And in reaction to last year's growing anti-globalist movement represented by the Brexit vote and also anti-establishment Trump election, the elite is becoming desperately aggressive right now, fighting for absolute domination and population control, insidiously wiping out
[00:37:49.039 --> 00:38:00.805]  You know, unstable domestic conditions throughout the Western world, engineered to explode, you know, with racial, class, religious, and also politically charged civil war violence in both America and Europe.
[00:38:00.805 --> 00:38:10.670]  What you're seeing in the United States, we have seen in Europe, in Spain, in Italy, in France, in England, in Germany, in other countries as well, in Portugal and also in Greece.
[00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:19.694]  In the United States, this takes the form of mass deployment of a robotically dumbed-down, highly manipulated, yet well-organized political left.
[00:38:19.694 --> 00:38:24.437]  And again, we've seen this, you know, with the flake movements in the United States right after the Trump election.
[00:38:24.437 --> 00:38:37.023]  Now, constituting the elite's weapons of mass destruction against Trump's reactionary or militarized authoritarian federal forces, soon spilling blood and chaos as America's very own spring uprising.
[00:38:37.743 --> 00:38:43.809]  The coming riots are aimed at causing the violent breakdown of civil society in both America and Europe.
[00:38:43.809 --> 00:38:47.872]  Of course, co-timed with the ongoing... Let me just back your view on so much knowledge here.
[00:38:47.872 --> 00:38:50.775]  Clearly they're trying to foment race war, all this crap.
[00:38:50.775 --> 00:38:51.735]  You mentioned that.
[00:38:51.735 --> 00:38:53.036]  They're trying to foment war.
[00:38:53.917 --> 00:39:01.306]  They admit they're trying to foment war, so let's dial back and talk about that some specifically because this is unprecedented.
[00:39:01.306 --> 00:39:11.017]  The COG, mainstream papers saying overthrow Trump, calling for civil war, and they're saying impose the economy to hurt nationalism as if the public doesn't get it.
[00:39:11.017 --> 00:39:12.298]  You're going to hurt our economy?
[00:39:12.899 --> 00:39:14.800]  I mean, forget Trump!
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.721]  They're openly saying, make us poorer!
[00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:23.325]  Well, Alex, there is a new norm in America that is one of chaos, race wars, and also mass shootings that are supposedly, you know, real.
[00:39:23.325 --> 00:39:31.870]  Unless, of course, you can provide a mountain of evidence to debunk the official mainstream media narrative, police announcements, or whatever intelligence sources, you know, are saying.
[00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.651]  And, of course, this new norm is, you know,
[00:39:34.831 --> 00:39:41.956]  Is even being contributed to by many alternative media sources in the interest of being correct, no, and authentic about what they're saying.
[00:39:41.956 --> 00:39:49.301]  I think, for the first time in modern American history, we have a generation that doesn't know what order, calmness, and peace look like.
[00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:56.426]  They have no idea what it's like not to be at war, or even to be in a war that has realistic scenarios for the possible ending date.
[00:39:56.426 --> 00:40:01.190]  And now, with the ruling elite moving as fast as ever to get their new world order done,
[00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:12.233]  We're seeing a brand new level of chaos and fear slowly becoming the new norm that particularly the millennials are being led to believe is inevitable and the new unavoidable reality.
[00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:13.434]  So I think that's what's happening.
[00:40:13.434 --> 00:40:13.774]  I agree.
[00:40:13.774 --> 00:40:16.855]  John McCain said the New World Order is collapsing in crisis.
[00:40:16.855 --> 00:40:17.895]  All the elites are saying it.
[00:40:17.895 --> 00:40:21.797]  I think it's premature to say that, but they're finally hitting the alarm bell.
[00:40:21.797 --> 00:40:22.657]  Why are they saying that?
[00:40:23.417 --> 00:40:39.379]  You know Alex, the chaos once almost exclusively limited to the Middle East, that we've become so accustomed to watching on television, is slowly but surely carrying over to the United States and also to Russia as we saw today, one PSYOP Gladio B operation staged event at a time.
[00:40:40.277 --> 00:40:43.478]  No longer is chaos something happening thousands of miles away.
[00:40:43.478 --> 00:40:44.839]  It's happening right here in America.
[00:40:44.839 --> 00:40:47.420]  It's happening in Russia, in my hometown.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:41:02.226]  And notice, you know, I keep saying chaos because unlike Operation Gladio, which occurred throughout Europe, mostly from the 1960s to the early 1980s, 1990s, sorry, the current so-called Operation Gladio B, which again, you know, we can call Northwood.
[00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:04.447]  Instead of being purely staged, they bring in people that will do it.
[00:41:04.907 --> 00:41:06.149]  Well, it's much more sophisticated.
[00:41:06.149 --> 00:41:17.220]  You have Gladio B, unlike Gladio A, is being conducted in an era of mass psychological terror and deception made possible by technology, legalized propaganda, fake terror groups like ISIS.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:17.821]  Amazing.
[00:41:17.821 --> 00:41:19.082]  I mean, Daniel, you move so quickly.
[00:41:19.082 --> 00:41:21.045]  It's all so on target while I'm getting my brain burning here.
[00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:21.946]  Let me ask this before we go to break.
[00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:24.833]  Why do they hate Russia so much?
[00:41:24.833 --> 00:41:27.654]  I mean, Russia... I'm not... I know you're a Russia expert.
[00:41:27.654 --> 00:41:28.354]  I've never been there.
[00:41:28.354 --> 00:41:29.395]  I just study it.
[00:41:29.395 --> 00:41:30.295]  They're not expanding.
[00:41:30.295 --> 00:41:31.355]  They're trying to build their country.
[00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:33.175]  They have good policies for their people.
[00:41:33.175 --> 00:41:35.496]  Why are the elites so out to get Russia?
[00:41:35.496 --> 00:41:37.096]  I just... It's crazy!
[00:41:37.096 --> 00:41:42.338]  Because you can't have one world government, one world company limited, unless you can destroy it.
[00:41:42.338 --> 00:41:44.058]  The only nuclear-powered
[00:41:44.958 --> 00:41:49.303]  China has nuclear weapons, but China's military is an economic superpower.
[00:41:49.303 --> 00:41:53.627]  Russia is the only alternative to the military superpower that is the United States.
[00:41:53.627 --> 00:41:58.813]  So again, until you can destroy Russia, you will not have your one world, whatever you want to call it.
[00:41:58.813 --> 00:42:00.675]  But their program destroying Russia is failing.
[00:42:00.675 --> 00:42:02.377]  The Russians always dig in.
[00:42:02.377 --> 00:42:03.318]  So where does that go?
[00:42:04.048 --> 00:42:07.251]  They just keep doing it and trying to destroy it any way possible.
[00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:09.372]  And again, chaos or order out of chaos.
[00:42:09.372 --> 00:42:10.894]  And this is what we're seeing right now.
[00:42:10.894 --> 00:42:19.981]  Keep in mind, Alex, that the people behind the economic policies in Russia are all the same liberal crowd pulled there by the Bill Clinton presidency 20 years ago.
[00:42:19.981 --> 00:42:29.569]  In other words, Putin may be a great leader and a great politician and a great strategist, but his hands are tied because, again, Putin, as the president, controls foreign policy.
[00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:31.190]  The Prime Minister Medvedev... That's right.
[00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.431]  He's completely surrounded like Trump.
[00:42:33.015 --> 00:42:42.483]  Well, he's a liberal stooge trader who works for the interests of the Western governing elite with all the bankers who represent... So, Putin and Trump are both surrounded.
[00:42:42.483 --> 00:42:44.324]  They, like Putin said yesterday, meet with me.
[00:42:44.324 --> 00:42:45.045]  Don't let them intimidate you.
[00:42:45.045 --> 00:42:49.869]  They need to come together, laugh at the whole system, and they need to have a huge, it'll have all the ratings.
[00:42:49.869 --> 00:42:51.790]  They need to, like, have a two-hour talk on TV.
[00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:53.231]  Let's talk about that right now.
[00:42:53.231 --> 00:42:58.376]  We need to get Putin and Trump together right now to just absolutely lay out what's happening.
[00:42:58.376 --> 00:42:59.477]  Daniel Esselin's our guest.
[00:42:59.477 --> 00:42:59.857]  Stay with us.
[00:43:00.197 --> 00:43:02.079]  You've heard of vigilante justice, right?
[00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:05.281]  Well, now we have Islamic Sharia Vigilantes!
[00:43:05.281 --> 00:43:10.746]  From the Star Tribune, Minneapolis Muslims protest Sharia Vigilante in Cedar Riverside area.
[00:43:10.746 --> 00:43:18.112]  That's right, 22-year-old Abdullah Rashid is trying to enforce what he calls the civil part of Sharia law in his area.
[00:43:18.112 --> 00:43:24.478]  He's been telling people in the Cedar Riverside, Somali-dominated neighborhood not to drink, use drugs, or interact with the opposite sex.
[00:43:24.838 --> 00:43:30.724]  If he sees Muslim women that he believes are dressed inappropriately, he approaches them and suggests they don a hijab.
[00:43:30.724 --> 00:43:39.934]  Back in February, Minneapolis police received reports from concerned citizens who saw Rashid in a dark green uniform donned with patches that said Muslim Defense Force and Religious Police.
[00:43:40.194 --> 00:43:44.359]  Also on the patches were two flags associated with ISIS and other terrorist groups.
[00:43:44.359 --> 00:43:47.682]  But his Muslim brethren do not share his same views.
[00:43:47.682 --> 00:43:55.150]  In fact, the Islamic Institute for Minnesota issued a statement saying Rashid does not speak any way for the Islamic Institute of Minnesota or Muslims in Minnesota.
[00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:58.934]  You can read more about this Sharia vigilante on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:58.934 --> 00:43:59.615]  Rob Dew reporting.
[00:43:59.995 --> 00:44:03.998]  A new shipment of BioTruth Selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:03.998 --> 00:44:05.480]  We've been sold out for months.

[00:44:10.544 --> 00:44:14.687]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[00:44:14.687 --> 00:44:19.231]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[00:44:19.231 --> 00:44:22.413]  But BioTruth Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:44:24.355 --> 00:44:27.836]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[00:44:27.836 --> 00:44:40.059]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system, to DNA production and eyesight, BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger, a survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[00:44:54.022 --> 00:44:56.109]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:57.614]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[00:44:57.614 --> 00:44:59.019]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:45:00.939 --> 00:45:02.820]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.860]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.762]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:45:07.762 --> 00:45:13.824]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:45:13.824 --> 00:45:23.027]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:45:23.027 --> 00:45:27.869]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:45:28.089 --> 00:45:30.551]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:45:30.551 --> 00:45:38.576]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:45:38.576 --> 00:45:39.517]  The general public doesn't.
[00:45:40.763 --> 00:45:44.127]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:45:44.127 --> 00:45:48.271]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:45:48.271 --> 00:45:54.978]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:45:54.978 --> 00:45:59.083]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:01.098 --> 00:46:07.642]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:46:07.642 --> 00:46:10.863]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:46:10.863 --> 00:46:16.446]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:46:16.446 --> 00:46:22.569]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:46:22.569 --> 00:46:25.851]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:46:25.851 --> 00:46:27.292]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:46:27.512 --> 00:46:31.813]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:46:31.813 --> 00:46:34.754]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:46:34.754 --> 00:46:36.415]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:46:36.415 --> 00:46:39.856]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:46:39.856 --> 00:46:42.456]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:46:42.456 --> 00:46:43.517]  It's in powder form.
[00:46:43.517 --> 00:46:46.398]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:46:46.398 --> 00:46:47.538]  I take this.
[00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:48.938]  This is the product that I take.
[00:46:48.938 --> 00:46:50.899]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:46:51.719 --> 00:46:52.520]  We fight the Globals!
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.661]  We fight the New World Order!

[00:46:57.925 --> 00:46:59.827]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:13.729 --> 00:47:21.837]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:21.837 --> 00:47:25.941]  I know you can see me now, here's a surprise.
[00:47:28.294 --> 00:47:34.917]  I know the globalists want to cut off the resources to dictate humanity's surrender to their technotronic system.
[00:47:34.917 --> 00:47:38.018]  And the communist Chinese, God bless them, are enslaving their own people.
[00:47:38.018 --> 00:47:40.479]  They're totally on board with the globalists.
[00:47:40.479 --> 00:47:49.622]  There's kind of some infighting and jockeying going on, but Russia has, you know, almost what, I was saying six times, three times the size of the U.S.
[00:47:49.622 --> 00:47:51.003]  Five or six times bigger than China.
[00:47:52.418 --> 00:47:53.519]  Most of it's unpopulated.
[00:47:53.519 --> 00:47:56.662]  And the globalists just say, we want that, we want that now.
[00:47:56.662 --> 00:48:00.325]  It's like they've taken Africa, exploited it, Latin America, you name it.
[00:48:00.325 --> 00:48:02.607]  You know, most of the Amazon Basin is unpopulated as well.
[00:48:02.607 --> 00:48:04.809]  They want people wiped out of there.
[00:48:04.809 --> 00:48:07.512]  We live in big cities because we're all together and think, oh, the world's overpopulated.
[00:48:07.512 --> 00:48:08.553]  Go drive an hour.
[00:48:08.553 --> 00:48:09.294]  There's nothing out there.
[00:48:10.967 --> 00:48:15.411]  But you're on roads that go into the other towns, so it creates the perception there's always people.
[00:48:15.411 --> 00:48:15.891]  No.
[00:48:15.891 --> 00:48:17.052]  People means commerce.
[00:48:17.052 --> 00:48:18.293]  It means jobs.
[00:48:18.293 --> 00:48:23.758]  That's why, like a fish reef, you know, there might not be another reef for 200 miles in the ocean, but this reef's all these teeming fish.
[00:48:23.758 --> 00:48:24.898]  Oh, so many fish here!
[00:48:24.898 --> 00:48:25.799]  What's going on?
[00:48:25.799 --> 00:48:27.080]  That's because there's life there.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.642]  There's an economy.
[00:48:28.642 --> 00:48:31.504]  All right, Daniel Estillan, we were getting into Montenegro.
[00:48:31.504 --> 00:48:32.985]  The Senate passed it.
[00:48:32.985 --> 00:48:34.947]  Only two people voted against it.
[00:48:34.947 --> 00:48:37.989]  Sessions, obviously, is a vacant seat, so he wasn't there.
[00:48:37.989 --> 00:48:39.771]  But we're looking at all this.
[00:48:41.523 --> 00:48:43.624]  And they're trying to start a war there.
[00:48:43.624 --> 00:48:46.485]  Now Trump can veto it.
[00:48:46.485 --> 00:48:47.906]  Or NATO can veto it.
[00:48:47.906 --> 00:48:50.407]  But regardless, they want to start a war.
[00:48:50.407 --> 00:48:53.248]  What do you think the global order is going to do?
[00:48:53.248 --> 00:48:56.710]  Because last time we had you on a year ago, you said, well, there have been some problems, but
[00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.191]  They're not in crisis yet.
[00:48:58.191 --> 00:48:59.792]  Sounds like you're saying they're panicked.
[00:48:59.792 --> 00:49:01.653]  They're in crisis.
[00:49:01.653 --> 00:49:05.235]  It seems like they're like Juncker saying we'll start a war with Europe.
[00:49:05.235 --> 00:49:07.717]  We'll march an EU army in.
[00:49:07.717 --> 00:49:10.078]  We'll economically destroy the UK.
[00:49:10.078 --> 00:49:13.060]  They're threatening us with breaking America up.
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.522]  It seems like this doesn't look like what winners do, but you're the expert.
[00:49:17.963 --> 00:49:19.764]  13 minutes, you've got the floor before you gotta go.
[00:49:19.764 --> 00:49:21.265]  Give us your presentation.
[00:49:21.265 --> 00:49:26.229]  Again, Daniel Estelin, the best-selling author of the Club Bilderberg and so many books.
[00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:28.490]  You can follow him, obviously, on Twitter.
[00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:30.091]  We'll put that up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:49:30.091 --> 00:49:34.234]  But Daniel, again, what other knowledge do you want to impart to folks?
[00:49:34.234 --> 00:49:36.975]  Well, I think it's important to understand why these people want to start a war.
[00:49:36.975 --> 00:49:42.199]  The world's financial system, Alex, can survive until about the end of 2017.
[00:49:42.199 --> 00:49:43.019]  The total collapse
[00:49:45.207 --> 00:49:50.169]  The system that we know today will come no longer than January, February 2018.
[00:49:50.169 --> 00:49:56.071]  Every financial instrument and mechanism available was used up to avoid the 2008 near collapse.
[00:49:56.071 --> 00:49:58.272]  So there's no more money in the current system.
[00:49:58.272 --> 00:50:10.656]  The International Monetary Fund and also the United States policy to stimulate the outflow of capital from developing countries, which includes obviously China and Russia, thus buying time for themselves, have taken out over $200 billion from Russia
[00:50:12.838 --> 00:50:17.188]  Manipulating their currency, devaluing the rubles, you know, through the central bank.
[00:50:17.188 --> 00:50:21.659]  And of course, the director of the central bank was pulled there by Clinton's allies in the United States.
[00:50:22.336 --> 00:50:29.739]  And these are the same people who have also caused the outflow of over $1 trillion from China and doing the same thing with the yuan.
[00:50:29.739 --> 00:50:44.466]  In addition, they also took out between $2 and $3 trillion, which were literally stolen from the offshore accounts of the British elite via a Panama Papers scandal, bringing to light the money hidden by the aristocracy, mainly English aristocracy.
[00:50:44.466 --> 00:50:46.467]  This, in fact, was the beginning of Brexit.
[00:50:46.467 --> 00:50:48.688]  Now, Trump has two options available to him.
[00:50:49.269 --> 00:50:59.036]  You either save the United States economy and sink the economies of the rest of the world, because again, you don't have enough money in the system to do everything, or you save the world at the expense of the United States.
[00:50:59.036 --> 00:51:03.260]  And according to Trump, there will be no more dollars for international investments.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.482]  Only investment available will be to save the American economy.
[00:51:06.482 --> 00:51:11.085]  Thus, in his first speech, he explicitly talked about the need to invest in U.S.
[00:51:11.085 --> 00:51:11.686]  infrastructure.
[00:51:12.086 --> 00:51:23.597]  Something that you and I talked about over a year ago, before Trump's election, before the primaries, we said the need for progress and development of society goes through infrastructure and space exploration.
[00:51:23.597 --> 00:51:35.709]  Because when we build infrastructure, Alex, we're actually reorganizing the physical space-time of the planet, allowing our world to attain- We're taking fiat crap and actually building something and making it about human activity.
[00:51:36.405 --> 00:51:37.386]  That's one way of putting it.
[00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:53.558]  So, you know, if your system is increasingly moving to higher levels of efficiency, such as, you know, from coal-based economy to an oil-based economy to a nuclear-based economy, there'll be an increase in the productive power of human labor at every step of the way, and that's the way the actual wealth is created.
[00:51:53.558 --> 00:51:59.263]  Money is simply the way of- But as you know, the globalists admit they want a post-industrial world squeezing off resources.
[00:51:59.263 --> 00:52:04.347]  That's really Trump's great sin, because he wants cheaper energy and innovation and a world based on humans.
[00:52:04.987 --> 00:52:10.250]  And that goes through, actually, probably one of the greatest speeches ever made by a United States politician.
[00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:15.213]  In this case, Donald Trump made one of the greatest speeches ever, when he talked about the need for space exploration.
[00:52:15.213 --> 00:52:18.916]  And again, money has no intrinsic value.
[00:52:18.916 --> 00:52:20.677]  It possesses no magical powers.
[00:52:20.677 --> 00:52:22.538]  Oh, exploration and trailblazing.
[00:52:23.078 --> 00:52:23.679]  Exactly.
[00:52:23.679 --> 00:52:24.640]  Yes, sir.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.281]  Well, Alex, exactly.
[00:52:26.281 --> 00:52:31.466]  You know, we are at the gates of a worldwide economic default and dismantling of the capital system.
[00:52:31.466 --> 00:52:39.074]  And the only difference, again, going back to Hillary Clinton, is that Clinton would have pushed us into world war, which would probably have meant the end of mankind as we know it.
[00:52:39.074 --> 00:52:40.515]  That was the old answer to collapse.
[00:52:40.515 --> 00:52:41.176]  We can't do that now.
[00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:42.631]  Exactly.
[00:52:42.631 --> 00:52:50.677]  You know, at the global level, those who supported Clinton are also inside the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund, Council of Europe, European Parliament, endless U.S.
[00:52:50.677 --> 00:52:53.079]  think tanks, liberal lobby groups.
[00:52:53.079 --> 00:52:56.201]  And in Russia, these people are represented by the United Russia.
[00:52:56.201 --> 00:52:58.863]  That's President Putin's party and Prime Minister Medvedev's.
[00:52:58.863 --> 00:53:05.088]  Of course, Putin has very little to do with United Russia in a sense that his policies are progress and development.
[00:53:05.088 --> 00:53:06.609]  You're saying his own party's the enemy?
[00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:15.515]  From Russian history, that it took President Putin two presidencies to actually get control of all the circles of power within the Russian government.
[00:53:15.515 --> 00:53:17.856]  And of course, the United States is seeing the same thing.
[00:53:17.856 --> 00:53:25.782]  And these people, they will do everything possible to recover the power they lost, making use of a wide range of hybrid, irregular methodologies from megaterrorism.
[00:53:25.782 --> 00:53:27.443]  Yeah, deep state, people ignoring.
[00:53:27.443 --> 00:53:31.305]  Well, that's why even Fareed Zakaria, a Bilderberg guy, says Trump's most powerful, I mean,
[00:53:32.466 --> 00:53:34.247]  Putin's the most powerful leader in the world.
[00:53:34.247 --> 00:53:36.227]  Not that Russia's even that powerful now economically.
[00:53:36.227 --> 00:53:38.208]  You know, economically it's like Italy.
[00:53:38.208 --> 00:53:50.232]  It's because he actually is in power, which we're not pushing dictatorship, but instead of globalist manipulation, it's a guy for Russia in charge, and that's why he's so hard to deal with, because finally, a country's actually in charge of itself.
[00:53:50.232 --> 00:53:51.712]  Well, look what they're doing all over the world.
[00:53:51.712 --> 00:53:59.035]  In Western Europe, assassination of politicians, Russian ambassador... Hundreds of top Russians killed, 30 or 40 very, very top ones.
[00:53:59.035 --> 00:53:59.575]  What do you make of that?
[00:54:01.094 --> 00:54:03.295]  Part of the part, you know, part and parcel of what we're talking about.
[00:54:03.295 --> 00:54:07.897]  Civil society breakdown, civil disobedience, United-based or Europe.
[00:54:07.897 --> 00:54:09.838]  Russia thus far has been able to avoid that.
[00:54:09.838 --> 00:54:13.499]  You know, to using refugees as a weapon of destabilization and terrorism.
[00:54:13.499 --> 00:54:16.480]  Of course, look at the refugee crisis in Europe.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.902]  60 million displaced, of which 5 million are from Syria alone.
[00:54:19.902 --> 00:54:25.504]  And you said an endgame in 2007, 10 years ago, they would use refugees as weapons.
[00:54:25.504 --> 00:54:27.065]  I know you had sources inside.
[00:54:27.065 --> 00:54:28.065]  They've been planning this forever.
[00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:31.848]  Well, Bilderberg has been planning these things, you know, they plan generations ahead.
[00:54:31.848 --> 00:54:40.716]  And in Germany, today, more than 200 cities have shelters for refugees, many of them living in slums, in the ghettos, segregated from the rest of the population.
[00:54:40.716 --> 00:54:41.997]  The tensions are palpable.
[00:54:41.997 --> 00:54:47.582]  And it's only a matter of time, Alex, before an explosion and social breakdown occurs in Germany, in Italy,
[00:54:47.742 --> 00:54:49.163]  And that's how you started.
[00:54:49.163 --> 00:54:53.245]  What are they planning to do after this social breakdown happens that the media is hyping?
[00:55:08.573 --> 00:55:18.876]  You know, above the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, we have the Astors, the Lodges, the Flemings, the Grosvenors, the Mathesons, the Keswiks, whose fortunes are measured and counted in trillions of dollars.
[00:55:18.876 --> 00:55:24.718]  Trump represents a change in the paradigm of society as we have never seen in the history of humanity.
[00:55:24.718 --> 00:55:28.879]  Not a new world order, but rather a new world struggling to be born, unsure of a true world order.
[00:55:28.879 --> 00:55:34.701]  So you're saying the Rothschilds are backing Trump versus the eugenics-based Rockefellers?
[00:55:35.581 --> 00:55:36.221]  Exactly.
[00:55:36.221 --> 00:55:41.322]  Again, if you kind of look at the people behind... I told my CA sources three years ago, they said, oh, you're bashing the Rothschilds.
[00:55:41.322 --> 00:55:42.702]  Watch what they're about to do.
[00:55:42.702 --> 00:55:44.323]  They're going to try to actually give wealth back to the people.
[00:55:44.323 --> 00:55:45.763]  Not because they're even good.
[00:55:45.763 --> 00:55:48.064]  They don't want a total worldwide bloodbath.
[00:55:48.064 --> 00:55:51.164]  Just at this time, their interests coincide with our interests.
[00:55:51.164 --> 00:56:02.346]  Because again, behind Clinton, you have the Rockefellers, the transnational bankers, which is the World Company Limited, the globalists, non-American, you know, or American power elite circles.
[00:56:02.346 --> 00:56:05.327]  The people backing Donald Trump are the
[00:56:05.367 --> 00:56:27.798]  Non-American financier circles centered in the city of London, Hong Kong, World Center for Money Laundering, Drugs, Intelligence, and British Control, leftover elite circles of the British Empire, the Rothschilds, European elite represented by the old European aristocracy such as the houses of Sage Coburg, Austro-Hungarian aristocracy, and also Ottoman nobility, as well as the Venetian Black nobility.
[00:56:27.798 --> 00:56:31.260]  And then on a smaller scale, you have the intelligence agencies, so on and so forth.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.461]  These are big groups of people, very powerful individuals historically.
[00:56:35.461 --> 00:56:37.561]  Was it fair to say most U.S.
[00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:39.821]  intelligence, from what I've researched, is for Trump?
[00:56:39.821 --> 00:56:40.321]  Most U.S.
[00:56:40.321 --> 00:56:45.222]  intelligence except for the DEA, NSA, and the CIA.
[00:56:45.222 --> 00:56:47.143]  All right, well it's a crazy time to be alive, Daniel.
[00:56:47.143 --> 00:56:48.283]  We've got 50 seconds left.
[00:56:48.283 --> 00:56:49.963]  What else do you want to add?
[00:56:49.963 --> 00:56:56.824]  I think, again, be vigilant, be intelligent, don't follow propaganda techniques, analyze, and also ask the right questions.
[00:56:56.824 --> 00:56:57.744]  Why is this being done?
[00:56:57.744 --> 00:57:00.465]  Who's going to win and who's going to benefit when all is said and done?
[00:57:01.431 --> 00:57:04.995]  Alright, and again, on Twitter, what's the best place for people to get in touch with you?
[00:57:04.995 --> 00:57:06.957]  At Estulin Daniel, that's my Twitter account.
[00:57:06.957 --> 00:57:13.744]  And again, Alex, congratulations on a very important, international, very prestigious journalistic award in Mexico.
[00:57:13.744 --> 00:57:15.927]  I also won an award for my documentary film.
[00:57:15.927 --> 00:57:18.770]  I know, I got the big press club award, one of the biggest groups in Latin America.
[00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:19.350]  I'm very honored.
[00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:21.633]  I wish I could have gone, but there was death threats, so I couldn't.
[00:57:21.633 --> 00:57:22.814]  I want to thank them, they're the right word.
[00:57:22.814 --> 00:57:23.255]  Thank you, Daniel.
[00:57:23.993 --> 00:57:24.694]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:57:24.694 --> 00:57:26.996]  I'm going to come back with some final comments straight ahead.
[00:57:26.996 --> 00:57:29.699]  You know, there's our award for the operation, all the great crew.
[00:57:29.699 --> 00:57:39.948]  When we come back, we're going to hit some other news I haven't covered yet, and we've got the great David Knight taking over on this Monday worldwide transmission.
[00:57:39.948 --> 00:57:47.416]  Infowars.com has a lot of key reports and videos that the globalists do not want you to see, that they do not want you to spread particularly.
[00:57:48.237 --> 00:57:50.359]  It's robots against humans, help spread those links.
[00:57:50.359 --> 00:57:58.348]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:58.348 --> 00:58:02.773]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds, even armor piercing.
[00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:04.974]  FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:58:04.974 --> 00:58:19.424]  The secret to Defender body armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[00:58:19.424 --> 00:58:22.306]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:58:22.566 --> 00:58:28.648]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:58:28.648 --> 00:58:29.428]  It works.
[00:58:29.428 --> 00:58:37.871]  Defender body armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[00:58:37.871 --> 00:58:47.614]  Defender body armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:58:47.614 --> 00:58:48.095]  A total 360 win.
[00:58:51.184 --> 00:58:53.266]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[00:58:53.266 --> 00:58:54.727]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[00:58:54.727 --> 00:58:57.370]  We've had an Easter Special, and I've decided to extend for another week.
[00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:01.614]  It is a great, empowering thing for me, personally, being under Global Sonslaught.
[00:59:01.614 --> 00:59:05.637]  And as the enemy turns up the wattage, every action has an opposite-equal reaction.
[00:59:05.637 --> 00:59:08.720]  God, or the good force in the universe, turns up my power.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.561]  So let me explain something.
[00:59:09.561 --> 00:59:10.742]  This is a great voyage.
[00:59:10.982 --> 00:59:11.242]  I'm on.
[00:59:11.242 --> 00:59:12.543]  And I know you're on it with me.
[00:59:12.543 --> 00:59:17.126]  The animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is the paramount vehicle.
[00:59:17.126 --> 00:59:22.029]  This whole world is a test and this experiment that we're all part of is key.
[00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:24.111]  You're conscious and alive and you care.
[00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:31.676]  And the fact that you're even involved and are even searching for the truth shows you're conscious and haven't been pulled under by these dark forces that now dominate our world.
[00:59:31.676 --> 00:59:36.979]  So whether you get our great products and support the broadcast, whether you pray for us, whether you just spread the word about the links, it doesn't matter.
[00:59:36.979 --> 00:59:39.501]  Just being conscious and awake connects us all together.
[00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:40.842]  And this is an incredible moment to be alive.
[00:59:40.922 --> 00:59:43.423]  So I'm Alex Jones with the entire InfoWars.com family.
[00:59:43.423 --> 00:59:52.727]  InfoWarsLive.com saluting all of you, no matter what color your skin is, where you came from in the world, or what your religious background is, we are unstoppable together.
[00:59:52.727 --> 01:00:05.912]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.912 --> 01:00:08.993]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:14.209]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:14.209 --> 01:00:22.795]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.795 --> 01:00:28.299]  I don't sit here before you in some arrogant fashion.
[01:00:28.299 --> 01:00:34.743]  I don't sit here as some potentate who set himself up as the high priest who claims he has all the answers.
[01:00:34.743 --> 01:00:39.527]  I am a lowly person who has seen the face of God.
[01:00:40.928 --> 01:00:52.813]  And who wishes to see others break free from the globalist control so that they can lead us with God's spirit out of this great time of evil.
[01:00:52.813 --> 01:00:56.795]  Last hour, they put together a powerful rebroadcast with Michael Savage and Daniel Estlin.
[01:00:56.795 --> 01:01:05.559]  We've got Chris Paranto, one of the greatest heroes of the modern age, a true archetype of manliness and commitment, and a Christian joining us.
[01:01:05.559 --> 01:01:08.841]  And then we have Michael Savage again from an earlier interview we did.
[01:01:09.633 --> 01:01:18.198]  That's extremely informative, right as we were entering the final days of the election.
[01:01:18.198 --> 01:01:31.126]  But I don't sit here before millions of you, I don't just say this to sound humble, it's essential we understand that I know much of what I do is a wrecked failure of what my spirit wants to manifest.
[01:01:31.126 --> 01:01:36.950]  But it is in that willing, in that attempt to oppose the tyrants of the old age,
[01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:56.478]  That by increment, we together can dream, and as builders, then manifest, not through magic, but through real work, a better world.
[01:01:56.478 --> 01:02:04.725]  And I will assure you, when we have transcended this level of crisis, when humanity is finally together in will,
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:18.070]  Not collectivized, not enslaved, still individual, but so humbled by the great spectrum of understanding that we finally come together when we emerge into the next level of consciousness.
[01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:25.616]  It's going to be a full-on war at that level we can't even imagine, and we're going to emerge saying, why weren't we already ready for this?
[01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:27.477]  We had no idea what we were even entering.
[01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:33.662]  Because the world is all about competition, the universe is all about competition, the dimensions are all about competition, and
[01:02:34.523 --> 01:02:41.645]  Greediness and selfishness in the universe is a powerful force.
[01:02:41.645 --> 01:02:51.289]  And humanity on this plane of existence, despite the fact we come from the great spark of God, you can't just have the spark of God and be given power.
[01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:52.609]  You have to prove yourself.
[01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:55.010]  So as we go up through these levels,
[01:02:58.004 --> 01:03:00.765]  of dysfunction and corruption and evil.
[01:03:00.765 --> 01:03:06.826]  We have to realize that as we ascend higher and higher, the challenges are going to become greater and greater and greater.
[01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:18.909]  When you start getting up even within a trillion light years of God's consciousness, you realize, oh my God, we could destroy all the evil in the universe now below us, but that would end free will and end the test.
[01:03:21.152 --> 01:03:30.975]  For God's consciousness that swims down deep and then comes back up as God purifies himself over and over again in the great test.
[01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:35.196]  This isn't out of books, this isn't out of anything you'll ever read, this is out of my soul.
[01:03:35.196 --> 01:03:37.837]  You can deny this if you want, I know it's true.
[01:03:37.837 --> 01:03:41.218]  It's not my truth, it is the truth.
[01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:46.500]  And all of us are God experiencing consciousness.
[01:03:48.137 --> 01:03:56.700]  Like Christ, his perfect son, truly embodied to be tested to make us better.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:04.783]  Whether you believe the story of Christ, which has been proven by Roman historians, or don't, the archetype resonates true to all.
[01:04:04.783 --> 01:04:08.625]  Someone so powerful, when the devil comes and says, I'll give you the whole world,
[01:04:09.605 --> 01:04:20.348]  Christ had to weaken himself 30 plus days, what was it, out in the desert, no food, no one could live, just to even lower himself to the level to be tempted.
[01:04:20.348 --> 01:04:34.233]  That's an archetype of not just what he did in the desert, but God lowering himself all the way down from total consciousness, able to create the entire universe we know, all the way down in humbleness to experience that with us.
[01:04:34.233 --> 01:04:37.514]  And then to be tested.
[01:04:44.394 --> 01:04:48.897]  I hope we're able to broadcast this on a Sunday, I think we will.
[01:04:48.897 --> 01:04:50.819]  Alright, retransmission straight ahead.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.962]  Today I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:05:05.962 --> 01:05:12.025]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force.
[01:05:12.025 --> 01:05:14.586]  And we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[01:05:14.586 --> 01:05:22.509]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[01:05:22.509 --> 01:05:28.651]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:32.033]  NAR Lipoic Acid, Bio PQQ and many others.
[01:05:32.033 --> 01:05:36.736]  Bio PQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[01:05:36.736 --> 01:05:40.518]  And just one batch of this stuff cost us more than $30,000.
[01:05:40.518 --> 01:05:43.240]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:51.385]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party certified review agency, Power Review.
[01:05:51.385 --> 01:05:56.948]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com before it sells out again.
[01:05:56.948 --> 01:05:58.089]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:20.766 --> 01:06:23.350]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:29.598]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:29.598 --> 01:06:31.500]  Well, the head of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:06:32.998 --> 01:06:36.722]  Devin Nunes has come out and said, I've seen all the proof from all the different agencies.
[01:06:36.722 --> 01:06:38.643]  Of course, the president was under surveillance.
[01:06:38.643 --> 01:06:45.329]  Just as he said, they were unlawfully using foreign intelligence gathered on phone calls he was using and his staff was using.
[01:06:45.329 --> 01:06:51.936]  And the transition team, as they're supposed to do, to politically spy on him and then claim they had evidence that he was this Russian agent.
[01:06:51.936 --> 01:06:53.037]  But there was no evidence there.
[01:06:53.037 --> 01:06:56.560]  So Trump demanded it come out and pointed out it was illegal to leak it.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.802]  They said, we never spied on you thinking we have no memory.
[01:06:59.892 --> 01:07:04.815]  They're betting everything on that, just like River said, with Obamacare.
[01:07:04.815 --> 01:07:18.982]  And now we've got, two days ago, on the one-year anniversary of the Brussels-Belgium attack, we got a bunch of people getting run over and killed and stabbed to death, and members of Parliament saying, don't say it's Islamic.
[01:07:18.982 --> 01:07:21.003]  It's just crazy.
[01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:26.806]  And now we've got three million more Islamist, quote, refugees the UN's trying to force Europe to bring in.
[01:07:26.806 --> 01:07:28.707]  They want hundreds of thousands more to be brought in here.
[01:07:31.035 --> 01:07:35.657]  We just played the Democratic Party with the Syrian refugees coming in, giving them voter registration cards.
[01:07:35.657 --> 01:07:36.638]  There's so much to talk about.
[01:07:36.638 --> 01:07:39.439]  The point is, there's a lot of special hunters who think this country belongs to them.
[01:07:39.439 --> 01:07:40.219]  They've overrun it.
[01:07:40.219 --> 01:07:42.320]  They've taken control of it.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.122]  But the good news is, the sleeping giant that is America, of every race, color, and creed, we're all Americans.
[01:07:47.122 --> 01:07:48.123]  We bleed red blood.
[01:07:48.123 --> 01:07:49.783]  We're one race on this planet.
[01:07:49.783 --> 01:07:53.985]  We're waking up to it, and it's a beautiful thing.
[01:07:53.985 --> 01:07:57.507]  Michael Moore came out again yesterday and said we need a civil emergency and to overthrow
[01:07:58.629 --> 01:08:10.159]  President Trump, you see it all over the news, killing, have Marshall Law, Rosie O'Donnell, you have the former deputy head of the Defense Department in the news going to the Pentagon trying to shop the idea of the military overthrowing the president.
[01:08:10.159 --> 01:08:13.742]  That's so illegal, folks, that it makes my head spin.
[01:08:14.463 --> 01:08:18.325]  And it's a bunch of foreign interests, the Communist Chinese coming in to help censor Facebook.
[01:08:18.325 --> 01:08:19.606]  You cannot make this up.
[01:08:19.606 --> 01:08:34.733]  So I just talked to some military guys I know, who happen to know Chris Tonto-Piranto, of course, one of the big heroes and survivors of what happened in Benghazi, and of course, lionized properly so in the new film, 13 Hours, it's a big hit and so amazing, to ask, what do you think we should do?
[01:08:34.733 --> 01:08:42.057]  Well, say we support the president and talk about if they're calling for military operations against the president, we're not calling for anything offensive, but
[01:08:42.757 --> 01:08:50.024]  We should start a discussion about the left thinking and Soros doubling the amount of money to these groups to kill cops and burn down cities.
[01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:50.945]  They're planning something.
[01:08:50.945 --> 01:08:53.127]  So, Chris, we're going to skip this break so you have more time.
[01:08:53.127 --> 01:08:55.349]  Thank you for joining us and coming on.
[01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:56.811]  Obviously, everything you've done, Chris.
[01:08:56.811 --> 01:08:58.532]  TontoPiranto.com.
[01:08:58.532 --> 01:09:00.695]  I've kind of set the table the last four minutes.
[01:09:00.695 --> 01:09:02.717]  Where are we going with this?
[01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:08.882]  I honestly, I think right now it's just a lot of lib talk.
[01:09:08.882 --> 01:09:13.886]  It'd be really ridiculous at this point for them to start, there's some civil war going on.
[01:09:13.886 --> 01:09:22.974]  You've got guys like myself, you've got plenty of contractors out there that are back home now, plenty of people like myself that are patriots that aren't going to stand aside.
[01:09:23.494 --> 01:09:25.076]  I don't think it's realistic.
[01:09:25.076 --> 01:09:27.178]  I think again it's a lot of threats and the libs do that.
[01:09:27.178 --> 01:09:32.043]  They are a lot of talk, but when action comes and it comes to actually picking up a gun and doing something...
[01:09:47.497 --> 01:09:54.361]  I think if they were more inclined to protect this country, you'd probably see more of them joining the military or joining the law enforcement.
[01:09:54.361 --> 01:09:58.943]  So I see it as a lot of BS, a lot of just tough talk at this point in time.
[01:09:58.943 --> 01:10:01.404]  But if it comes to this, it's not going to be tough talk.
[01:10:01.404 --> 01:10:06.086]  Believe me, people like myself will stand up and we'll be coming right back at you.
[01:10:06.086 --> 01:10:07.707]  So I just warn them, don't.
[01:10:07.707 --> 01:10:15.451]  Just stop that BS and put a cork in it right now before it really ends up getting to something that they really don't want to get into.
[01:10:16.303 --> 01:10:21.666]  Well, Chris, that's exactly why, as this rhetoric heated up, I wanted to get you on, because you're somebody with just a few other guys.
[01:10:21.666 --> 01:10:23.267]  Of course, some of them died, unfortunately.
[01:10:23.267 --> 01:10:30.752]  Took on hundreds and hundreds of people in two different, you know, major battle scenes under 13 hours of an admitted stand-down.
[01:10:30.752 --> 01:10:33.334]  You just have the physical courage and one of the most, you know, amazing...
[01:10:33.994 --> 01:10:44.541]  Alamo's where some people actually made it out or a 300 where a few people actually made it so I mean it's beyond that you actually survived at a 300 type you know scenario but where it was just six against 300 or 500 but looking at this
[01:10:47.714 --> 01:11:13.986]  That's why I wanted to get you to talk about this as an expert on it, because they seem confident, and I agree it's a lot of talk, but they're really trying to organize it, and I understand Trump's resistance to standing up to this because it'll make him look like a fascist, but when they're openly calling for his death everywhere, and my death and everybody else, and it's just horrible, at a certain point it becomes dereliction of duty if somebody doesn't get indicted, if somebody doesn't get in trouble, you know, when Bow Wow
[01:11:14.506 --> 01:11:18.391]  You know, says, I want to kidnap and rape and enslave the First Lady.
[01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:25.078]  Or when his uncle comes out, Snoop Dogg, and says, I want to kill Trump, puts a music video out.
[01:11:25.078 --> 01:11:26.740]  We know he's a coward, won't do it.
[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.544]  But he's trying to activate other mentally ill people.
[01:11:29.544 --> 01:11:30.565]  So that's why I'm so concerned.
[01:11:30.825 --> 01:11:33.388]  That's true, and you have a good point there.
[01:11:33.388 --> 01:11:38.933]  In the past, if you did that, then the Secret Service would be knocking at your door and possibly you'd be going to prison.
[01:11:38.933 --> 01:11:40.255]  I think that needs to happen.
[01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:41.196]  I think it needs to return.
[01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:43.638]  There does need to be an example set.
[01:11:43.638 --> 01:11:49.164]  Whether it be Snoop Dogg or somebody else out there where you're going to say you're going to kill the President, that's a threat.
[01:11:49.164 --> 01:11:50.946]  That is a terroristic threat at this point.
[01:11:51.747 --> 01:11:57.553]  And the Secret Service, FBI, local law enforcement, somebody needs to be knocking on the doors and pulling these guys in handcuffs.
[01:11:57.553 --> 01:12:06.903]  And honestly, if it is a star, and I hate to use the word Hollywood star, but if that's what you want to call yourselves, a star, you know, TMZ needs to be there too to make an example out of you.
[01:12:06.903 --> 01:12:08.064]  An example needs to be made.
[01:12:08.064 --> 01:12:11.068]  And I don't have a problem if Trump decided to do that.
[01:12:11.068 --> 01:12:12.169]  He shouldn't be called a fascist.
[01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:13.690]  That's the law.
[01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:15.492]  You don't threaten to kill the President of the United States.
[01:12:15.492 --> 01:12:16.093]  You don't do that.
[01:12:16.093 --> 01:12:17.474]  In the past, you've never done it.
[01:12:17.474 --> 01:12:19.757]  If you do do it, there are repercussions to it.
[01:12:19.757 --> 01:12:30.808]  And I think he does at this point in time or somebody within the Justice Session, somebody within the DOJ needs to take this upon themselves and go ahead and do the right thing and arrest somebody.
[01:12:31.048 --> 01:12:34.310]  Make an example out of somebody and make it a public example.
[01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:36.911]  And, you know, we'll see what happens.
[01:12:36.911 --> 01:12:37.831]  You can't keep letting it go.
[01:12:37.831 --> 01:12:38.911]  You're correct.
[01:12:38.911 --> 01:12:40.712]  You've got to lance that blister eventually.
[01:12:40.712 --> 01:12:42.113]  If not, it's going to get infected.
[01:12:42.113 --> 01:12:42.813]  You've got to do it.
[01:12:42.813 --> 01:12:45.114]  And if you don't, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:12:45.114 --> 01:12:46.575]  So I do agree.
[01:12:46.575 --> 01:12:48.556]  I do agree at this point with the threats to the president.
[01:12:48.556 --> 01:12:54.918]  But again, do I think that they're going to come out and actually start an all-out war, a civil war in the United States of America?
[01:12:54.918 --> 01:12:57.139]  They'd be well-earned to not do that.
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.822]  I totally agree with what you're saying about the battle space.
[01:13:01.822 --> 01:13:02.563]  We have the right.
[01:13:02.563 --> 01:13:03.303]  We're Americans.
[01:13:03.303 --> 01:13:06.506]  99% of the patriots are obviously with the president.
[01:13:06.506 --> 01:13:10.128]  He's executing like no president I've ever seen on his promises.
[01:13:10.128 --> 01:13:11.309]  It's almost unbelievable.
[01:13:11.309 --> 01:13:12.310]  It's so good.
[01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:15.312]  And so it'd be one thing if he was like selling us out to foreign powers or something.
[01:13:15.312 --> 01:13:16.853]  And that brings us to the next point.
[01:13:16.853 --> 01:13:20.816]  What do you make of now Nunes coming out and saying, no, they were surveilling him basically illegally.
[01:13:20.816 --> 01:13:24.399]  The surveillance was legal because it was overseas, but they were using it domestically
[01:13:24.679 --> 01:13:35.643]  The Democratic Party during the transition and then this claim that he's a Russian agent securing our borders, building up our military, turning our coal back on that actually decimates the Russian gas exports.
[01:13:35.643 --> 01:13:37.983]  I mean, really, if you look at what Trump's doing, he's dominating.
[01:13:37.983 --> 01:13:38.283]  He is.
[01:13:38.283 --> 01:13:39.324]  He's doing it.
[01:13:39.324 --> 01:13:40.004]  I love what you said.
[01:13:40.004 --> 01:13:41.785]  He's doing exactly what he said.
[01:13:41.785 --> 01:13:46.246]  There's no president, I think, that's come in the last, I know, in the last eight years for sure.
[01:13:46.246 --> 01:13:48.327]  But the last, you know, 12, 16 years.
[01:13:48.327 --> 01:13:49.907]  Reagan was great, but he didn't deliver.
[01:13:49.907 --> 01:13:51.448]  It took him three years to deliver a recovery.
[01:13:51.448 --> 01:13:52.488]  Trump's done it in 50 days.
[01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:55.530]  Yes, it's been outstanding, and I have respect for that.
[01:13:55.530 --> 01:14:00.813]  Whether I agree with the policies or not, he's doing what he said he was going to do, and that's fantastic.
[01:14:00.813 --> 01:14:04.356]  As far as Núñez, I know Congressman Núñez.
[01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:06.017]  Congressman Núñez is actually a friend.
[01:14:06.017 --> 01:14:08.699]  Congressman Núñez has always said what he meant.
[01:14:08.699 --> 01:14:11.841]  He's always been honest with everything that he's had to do with myself.
[01:14:11.841 --> 01:14:14.302]  He just comes off as very, a lot of courage, very honorable.
[01:14:14.302 --> 01:14:16.444]  He's the only guy to admit the truth when they all know the truth.
[01:14:17.404 --> 01:14:21.726]  And so if he's saying it, I'll give it 99.9% that that thing is going on.
[01:14:21.726 --> 01:14:29.770]  And as far as them doing it legally, and then doing an illegal, what it is, they're doing something illegally, but pulling illegal things off of it, that's typical CIA at the moment.
[01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:31.170]  Pompeo needs to clean house there.
[01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:33.031]  They need to come in and see what was actually going on.
[01:14:33.031 --> 01:14:41.535]  There needs to be heads to roll at the agency, because what they were doing, they were getting information about Trump, and it was, in my opinion,
[01:14:41.935 --> 01:14:42.496]  That's illegal.
[01:14:42.496 --> 01:14:43.196]  You don't do that.
[01:14:43.196 --> 01:14:50.321]  Whether it's with a, you're doing a legal action, going to foreign powers, but you're masking an illegal action by doing that.
[01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:52.902]  Well, that's illegal, isn't it?
[01:14:52.902 --> 01:14:54.423]  It's still illegal.
[01:14:54.423 --> 01:15:11.094]  So, my opinion is, again, Pompeo needs to get in there and take care of the agency and find out what was going on and see if there is actual basis to get somebody arrested, get some charges against somebody within the intelligence community.
[01:15:11.414 --> 01:15:13.456]  And Congressman Nunes, I think, will pursue that.
[01:15:13.456 --> 01:15:14.117]  I really do.
[01:15:14.117 --> 01:15:18.462]  He's a pit bull that he will continue to pursue until he's run out of options.
[01:15:18.462 --> 01:15:24.409]  He did that with us as best he could when he was under Mike Rogers on that House Intel Subcommittee, and I thought he did a fantastic job.
[01:15:24.409 --> 01:15:25.670]  Now he's out of the committee.
[01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:26.191]  Exactly.
[01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:30.875]  If that says anything about how honest this man is and his integrity.
[01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:32.997]  So I leave it in Congressman Nunes' hands.
[01:15:32.997 --> 01:15:36.480]  He's a subject matter expert when it comes to this, and I think he can continue to pursue it.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:44.447]  And he will come to a good resolution if people within the Trump administration's sessions and others will back him.
[01:15:44.447 --> 01:15:50.192]  He has a good Attorney General that can help him out, where in our case, we didn't have a good Attorney General twice.
[01:15:50.192 --> 01:15:52.154]  We had Eric Holder and then Loretta Lynch.
[01:15:52.154 --> 01:15:53.415]  Of course, weren't going to back us at all.
[01:15:54.055 --> 01:15:59.640]  So, but I think I think he has the opportunity here to to come in and again set examples.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:05.685]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:16:05.685 --> 01:16:07.767]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:16:07.767 --> 01:16:13.071]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:16:13.071 --> 01:16:16.834]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[01:16:16.914 --> 01:16:20.357]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:16:20.357 --> 01:16:23.539]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:16:23.539 --> 01:16:27.422]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:16:27.422 --> 01:16:34.587]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:16:34.587 --> 01:16:39.991]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:16:40.231 --> 01:16:42.293]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[01:16:42.293 --> 01:16:50.581]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.
[01:16:50.581 --> 01:16:58.889]  Learn more about the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:16:59.989 --> 01:17:04.011]  A new shipment of BioTruth Selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:04.011 --> 01:17:05.471]  We've been sold out for months.
[01:17:05.471 --> 01:17:10.533]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife BioTruth Selenium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:10.533 --> 01:17:14.694]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[01:17:14.694 --> 01:17:19.216]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[01:17:19.216 --> 01:17:22.477]  But BioTruth Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seeds.
[01:17:24.338 --> 01:17:27.820]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:31.983]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[01:17:31.983 --> 01:17:37.087]  Biotruselenium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine.
[01:17:37.087 --> 01:17:40.069]  As both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[01:17:40.069 --> 01:17:44.752]  Visit Infowarslife.com to order your bottle of Biotruselenium before we sell it again.

[01:17:53.481 --> 01:17:54.022]  A 360 win.
[01:17:54.022 --> 01:17:56.104]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:17:56.104 --> 01:17:57.606]  This is the time to support Infowars.
[01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:58.787]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:00.802 --> 01:18:05.286]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:18:05.286 --> 01:18:16.217]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:18:16.377 --> 01:18:21.418]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:18:21.418 --> 01:18:23.999]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:25.719]  It helps detoxify.
[01:18:25.719 --> 01:18:28.600]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:33.361]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:18:33.361 --> 01:18:39.623]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:18:39.623 --> 01:18:44.964]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:18:44.964 --> 01:18:45.724]  I'm taking it now.
[01:18:45.964 --> 01:18:51.567]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[01:19:05.635 --> 01:19:14.483]  Yongevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.

[01:20:02.711 --> 01:20:16.982]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.982 --> 01:20:25.029]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:27.131]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:41.297 --> 01:20:42.998]  Chris Piranto, known as Tonto.
[01:20:42.998 --> 01:20:44.319]  I'm not going to go over his bio.
[01:20:44.319 --> 01:20:45.960]  Most people know who he is.
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:56.206]  There's a lot of secret wars that have gone on where some similar things happened, but one of the most famous, whether it was secret or public, you know, firefights where you guys were completely overrun.
[01:20:56.206 --> 01:20:59.328]  I know a lot of guys, some of the guys didn't make it back, so you don't want to say you were the...
[01:21:00.509 --> 01:21:08.558]  One of the top guys in this, but they all signaled the fact that you were one of the guys that was the most effective in that hellish situation that took place.
[01:21:08.558 --> 01:21:10.199]  And you didn't want us to plug this, but I'm going to do it.
[01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:14.084]  You've got the Ranger Way new book being released in May.
[01:21:14.084 --> 01:21:15.585]  I promise you'll come back for that.
[01:21:15.585 --> 01:21:18.068]  Also, you have the new firearm training DVD.
[01:21:18.068 --> 01:21:18.949]  That's something I want to watch.
[01:21:18.949 --> 01:21:21.632]  Is that available at christantoperanza.com?
[01:21:21.972 --> 01:21:22.753]  Yeah, it is.
[01:21:22.753 --> 01:21:24.815]  All this, and this stuff, I hate doing it.
[01:21:24.815 --> 01:21:27.037]  I'll be honest, Alex, I can't stand it.
[01:21:27.037 --> 01:21:28.018]  It doesn't matter, though.
[01:21:28.018 --> 01:21:30.500]  If we don't support ourselves, we're not going to have a voice.
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.661]  People should get all this.
[01:21:31.661 --> 01:21:33.723]  We have to build our own economy.
[01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:34.984]  And I appreciate that.
[01:21:34.984 --> 01:21:36.706]  But yes, you can get it all there.
[01:21:36.706 --> 01:21:40.810]  And I'm back in the training area, back with firearms and stuff I enjoy doing.
[01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:41.570]  But we all need this.
[01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:46.535]  You obviously know what you're doing, surviving one of the most, you know, totally overrun operations ever.
[01:21:47.156 --> 01:21:48.858]  Yes, yes sir.
[01:21:48.858 --> 01:21:52.143]  Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good and I was surrounded by a great freaking team.
[01:21:52.143 --> 01:21:56.809]  I had two Navy SEALs and three Marines with me too and the bottom line is you never gave up.
[01:21:56.809 --> 01:21:59.833]  But the survivors all contributed and they say you're, they're all heroes.
[01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:04.439]  They say though that you really, for the whole nine yards, really did, I mean you're the hero of the movie.
[01:22:04.439 --> 01:22:04.800]  Why is that?
[01:22:05.925 --> 01:22:08.349]  I think it's because I probably have the biggest personality.
[01:22:08.349 --> 01:22:09.411]  I'm the biggest smartass.
[01:22:09.411 --> 01:22:10.393]  How about that?
[01:22:10.393 --> 01:22:14.821]  People tend to gravitate towards the guy that's outspoken, and that's me.
[01:22:14.821 --> 01:22:17.707]  And also, I had no problem
[01:22:18.545 --> 01:22:20.247]  If I was going to die that night, I was going to die.
[01:22:20.247 --> 01:22:26.452]  I think if anybody that gets out there and is worried about dying in the line of fire, then they probably need to get out of the line of fire.
[01:22:26.452 --> 01:22:28.574]  You need to get out there to sacrifice yourself.
[01:22:28.574 --> 01:22:29.354]  Selfless service.
[01:22:29.354 --> 01:22:30.055]  Give of yourself.
[01:22:30.055 --> 01:22:30.936]  Kind of like we're doing.
[01:22:30.936 --> 01:22:32.077]  Put yourself on the forefront.
[01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:35.920]  I'm sure you get threats daily because of what you do, but that is important.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.522]  You need to be able to say, hey... Don't you get stronger, though?
[01:22:38.522 --> 01:22:39.823]  I've had more than threats.
[01:22:39.823 --> 01:22:42.405]  They've run all sorts of operations against us, like a movie.
[01:22:42.405 --> 01:22:43.787]  But I actually get stronger when it happens.
[01:22:43.787 --> 01:22:45.208]  It's really weird.
[01:22:45.208 --> 01:22:46.549]  The worse it gets, the better I get.
[01:22:47.029 --> 01:22:47.590]  That's good.
[01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:53.154]  That means that you have that never quit, that never quit mentality that you're going to win any battle.
[01:22:53.154 --> 01:22:55.535]  And that's what you needed.
[01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:57.817]  I was lucky to have a father that raised me that way.
[01:22:57.817 --> 01:23:02.460]  And lucky to be at a range of battalion, the 75th Second Battalion, that teaches you that.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:08.405]  And then to be in there that night with a great team that I knew was not going to quit on me, so I was going to quit on them.
[01:23:08.405 --> 01:23:10.526]  It just all comes back to teamwork.
[01:23:10.526 --> 01:23:12.828]  And it comes back to never giving up, never quitting.
[01:23:13.846 --> 01:23:15.072]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:23:15.072 --> 01:23:16.418]  And use the big words.
[01:23:16.418 --> 01:23:17.523]  I don't know those big words.
[01:23:17.523 --> 01:23:18.186]  Oh yeah, right.
[01:23:19.548 --> 01:23:20.949]  But no, it's like the interconnectedness.
[01:23:20.949 --> 01:23:23.490]  Because you all amplify each other.
[01:23:23.490 --> 01:23:24.151]  Exactly.
[01:23:24.151 --> 01:23:25.351]  No, that's exactly right.
[01:23:25.351 --> 01:23:27.572]  It's the spirit, isn't it?
[01:23:27.572 --> 01:23:29.434]  It comes back to having that faith.
[01:23:29.434 --> 01:23:32.695]  And the spirit is the perfect word for you atheists out there.
[01:23:32.695 --> 01:23:33.096]  Guess what?
[01:23:33.096 --> 01:23:34.756]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[01:23:34.756 --> 01:23:38.819]  You guys out there, there is something better and bigger than you that you need to rely on.
[01:23:38.819 --> 01:23:40.820]  Well, spirit is the spiritual Wi-Fi.
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:42.301]  And then it's what you're turning into.
[01:23:42.301 --> 01:23:43.121]  It's real.
[01:23:43.121 --> 01:23:48.204]  And people who don't know it, they don't... I mean, how sick do you get with guys in an eight-hour firefight like that?
[01:23:49.865 --> 01:23:56.308]  You know, the blessing that night, more than anything, was that we could answer each other's questions before it even happened.
[01:23:56.308 --> 01:24:01.732]  Just blessed to have those 30 days that we were just there together.
[01:24:01.732 --> 01:24:04.133]  Myself and Boone, though, very blessed to have him there.
[01:24:04.133 --> 01:24:06.474]  Him and I had been working together for 10 years.
[01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:10.797]  So, how lucky is that to have one of my best friends up there on the rooftop with me?
[01:24:11.597 --> 01:24:15.400]  Basically slaying folks all night that were trying to get up on our compound.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:20.623]  Again, sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, but sometimes faith is there and God takes care of you.
[01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:23.005]  Providence had a hand on that night.
[01:24:23.005 --> 01:24:23.806]  Definitely did.
[01:24:23.806 --> 01:24:25.667]  Some of you would make it out to tell the truth.
[01:24:26.347 --> 01:24:27.008]  Definitely.
[01:24:27.008 --> 01:24:29.431]  And some of us would sacrifice themselves.
[01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:31.934]  Ron and Bub gave the ultimate sacrifice.
[01:24:31.934 --> 01:24:34.197]  And they are the heroes.
[01:24:34.197 --> 01:24:34.878]  I'm no hero.
[01:24:34.878 --> 01:24:36.720]  The guys that survived are no heroes.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.864]  Those two are the heroes because they gave everything so we could come home.
[01:24:39.864 --> 01:24:42.287]  Well, if they were here today, though, they'd say everybody was together.
[01:24:42.287 --> 01:24:44.771]  And we're still alive through you, through everybody, right now.
[01:24:45.331 --> 01:24:46.152]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:46.152 --> 01:24:50.317]  Well, Tonto, in the six, seven minutes we've got left, I can't wait till your book comes out.
[01:24:50.317 --> 01:24:52.219]  Folks should get the firearm.
[01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:53.861]  Because I'm having to get back into firearms myself.
[01:24:53.861 --> 01:24:55.142]  I used to be very decent.
[01:24:55.142 --> 01:24:58.386]  But I'm having to get back into it because half the time I can't get inside of a barn anymore.
[01:25:00.468 --> 01:25:04.010]  I mean, all this stuff's going on here, and there's so much to cover.
[01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:07.071]  Just, what is front and center in your heart, in your mind?
[01:25:07.071 --> 01:25:12.672]  I mean, I'm not saying, the vets, when I ask vets to speak up for Trump, it's not that they haven't done more than anybody.
[01:25:12.672 --> 01:25:14.913]  We admire them, we support them.
[01:25:14.913 --> 01:25:17.594]  This is the battle for the real homeland politically.
[01:25:17.594 --> 01:25:22.956]  And I know we can say, oh, the leftists are all talk, saying kill Trump, do all this, but they're so crazy.
[01:25:23.716 --> 01:25:28.903]  You know, even a lobotomized pig sometimes can, you know, get something done.
[01:25:28.903 --> 01:25:33.849]  And they're just trying to activate all these crazies and all this stuff's happening.
[01:25:33.849 --> 01:25:38.415]  So just, in the last five minutes, what else is on your heart, on your mind, as you talk to folks?
[01:25:38.895 --> 01:25:43.520]  Well, speaking around, I just speak around the country, law enforcement needs to be supported more.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:52.229]  I think, and I would love to see Trump add more into the law enforcement community, add more into just local and state police, because really that is his protection.
[01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:56.653]  If it's going to come down to where people are going to actually be out for his life on U.S.
[01:25:56.653 --> 01:26:01.498]  soil, it's the LEOs that are going to be standing up in front of him, really not anybody else.
[01:26:02.119 --> 01:26:02.359]  I don't
[01:26:20.282 --> 01:26:21.763]  He's crazy as they're seen on the streets.
[01:26:21.763 --> 01:26:23.203]  He's leftist as they're seen on the streets.
[01:26:35.868 --> 01:26:39.132]  Soros doubling his destabilization money.
[01:26:39.132 --> 01:26:41.555]  He's a Nazi collaborator since he was 14.
[01:26:41.555 --> 01:26:43.238]  He's overthrown all these countries.
[01:26:43.238 --> 01:26:45.300]  He admittedly is a destabilizer.
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:51.468]  I get we're a free, open society, but if I did one-tenth of what he did, and I don't want to, by the way, I would be arrested so fast.
[01:26:51.468 --> 01:26:53.872]  I just don't get why is he allowed to do all this?
[01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:58.214]  Question where I wish Donald Trump would come on TV and you would ask President Trump that.
[01:26:58.214 --> 01:27:00.955]  Because this man is an insider.
[01:27:00.955 --> 01:27:06.037]  He is somebody that would be considered, I would consider a terrorist in another country if I was there.
[01:27:06.037 --> 01:27:07.818]  He'd fund the whole Arab Spring!
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:11.280]  I don't know.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.181]  It's a good question.
[01:27:12.181 --> 01:27:18.485]  Maybe when I'm sitting around and I have... I'm very lucky to have good... to friends up on the hill.
[01:27:18.485 --> 01:27:19.826]  I'm very lucky to have some good friends.
[01:27:19.826 --> 01:27:21.087]  Maybe ask them.
[01:27:21.087 --> 01:27:22.488]  That is a dang good question, Alex.
[01:27:22.488 --> 01:27:23.289]  I don't know.
[01:27:23.289 --> 01:27:23.789]  But he does.
[01:27:23.789 --> 01:27:27.232]  He's done things that probably need to... Well, there's no probably.
[01:27:27.232 --> 01:27:28.453]  We need George Soros here.
[01:27:29.293 --> 01:27:37.503]  And he needs to be under investigation for, bottom line, his terroristic activities in the United States of America.
[01:27:37.503 --> 01:27:40.187]  Hey, and if they have a problem with anybody going to get him, send me.
[01:27:40.187 --> 01:27:40.968]  Hey, I'm right here.
[01:27:40.968 --> 01:27:43.150]  I'll go put handcuffs on them and bring them to you.
[01:27:43.150 --> 01:27:44.031]  You just let me know.
[01:27:44.031 --> 01:27:48.236]  Give me the word if people are worried about saving face or threats against their lives.
[01:27:49.057 --> 01:27:50.058]  That's what we're here for.
[01:27:50.058 --> 01:27:51.538]  We're here to protect the United States.
[01:27:51.538 --> 01:27:56.821]  I mean, like I said, I'll take a couple buddies and we'll go grab them and bring them in to President Trump.
[01:27:56.821 --> 01:27:57.701]  Just give us a word.
[01:27:57.701 --> 01:27:58.701]  But it needs to happen.
[01:27:58.701 --> 01:27:59.382]  It does need to happen.
[01:27:59.382 --> 01:28:00.622]  And I am in total agreement with you.
[01:28:00.622 --> 01:28:03.804]  You got to cut the head off of a snake and watch it die.
[01:28:03.804 --> 01:28:06.165]  And I think right now that's the head right there is George Soros.
[01:28:06.585 --> 01:28:07.345]  Wow.
[01:28:07.345 --> 01:28:08.666]  Chris Tonto-Piranto.
[01:28:08.666 --> 01:28:10.966]  ChrisTontoPiranto.com.
[01:28:10.966 --> 01:28:12.047]  Anybody can just Google his name.
[01:28:12.047 --> 01:28:12.967]  Everybody knows who he is.
[01:28:12.967 --> 01:28:19.509]  So I'm glad we've had this discussion because I just see so much, so much intense craziness out there.
[01:28:19.509 --> 01:28:20.869]  And then the economy's up.
[01:28:20.869 --> 01:28:21.850]  Good things are happening.
[01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:24.931]  The left's in the news saying they want to implode the economy to stop Trump.
[01:28:24.931 --> 01:28:26.231]  They're economic terrorists now.
[01:28:26.231 --> 01:28:28.352]  I just don't know why they're so screwed up.
[01:28:28.352 --> 01:28:30.472]  So thank you so much, Chris.
[01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:31.893]  A 20-second closing comment.
[01:28:32.693 --> 01:28:33.874]  Hey, just thank you again.
[01:28:33.874 --> 01:28:37.236]  God bless you, all you Patriots out there that are listening, all you veterans.
[01:28:37.236 --> 01:28:38.256]  Thank you for your service.
[01:28:38.256 --> 01:28:41.077]  Thank you for supporting us and keep watching InfoWars.
[01:28:41.077 --> 01:28:42.718]  This guy's a good man, Alex Jones.
[01:28:42.718 --> 01:28:43.879]  Jones, I got your back, brother.
[01:28:43.879 --> 01:28:45.199]  Whenever you need me, you let me know.
[01:28:45.199 --> 01:28:45.600]  Thank you.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.740]  Wow, Chris, thank you.
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:49.722]  It's just great to know that you're out there and God bless you.
[01:28:49.722 --> 01:28:49.982]  Thank you.
[01:28:51.809 --> 01:28:56.970]  We'll be back with the former technical director of the NSA to expose what's really going on against Trump.
[01:28:56.970 --> 01:28:57.650]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:57.650 --> 01:28:58.610]  This is the InfoWar.
[01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:59.351]  Amazing interview.
[01:28:59.351 --> 01:28:59.991]  Thank you.
[01:28:59.991 --> 01:29:00.231]  Thank you.
[01:29:00.231 --> 01:29:03.291]  You've heard of Edward Bernays as the father of propaganda, right?
[01:29:03.291 --> 01:29:05.732]  But do you know who the grandfather of propaganda is?
[01:29:05.732 --> 01:29:11.473]  His name was George Creel, and he was the chairman of, wait for it, the Committee on Public Information!
[01:29:11.473 --> 01:29:11.833]  That's right.
[01:29:11.833 --> 01:29:15.474]  The CPI was established by President Woodrow Wilson by Executive Order 2594 on April 13,
[01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:19.514]  1917, just over a hundred years ago.
[01:29:19.514 --> 01:29:23.375]  The purpose of the CPI was to influence American public opinion towards supporting U.S.
[01:29:23.375 --> 01:29:26.816]  participation in World War I via a prolonged propaganda effort.
[01:29:26.816 --> 01:29:31.777]  The committee used newsprint, posters, radio telegraph, cable, and movies to broadcast its message.
[01:29:31.777 --> 01:29:42.739]  Michael Sweeney, who wrote the book Secrets of Victory, said every war story had been censored somewhere along the line, at the source, in transit, or in the newspaper offices, in accordance with voluntary rules established by the CPI.
[01:29:42.739 --> 01:29:45.059]  And who do you think worked at the Committee of Public Information?
[01:29:45.259 --> 01:29:49.282]  None other than Edwin Bernays, who directed the Latin News Service.
[01:29:49.282 --> 01:29:52.664]  The CPI was disbanded by an act of Congress on June 30th, 1919.
[01:29:52.664 --> 01:29:57.627]  We now know them as CNN, MSNBC, Fox, ABC, and CBS.

[01:31:20.215 --> 01:31:26.179]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[01:31:51.811 --> 01:31:53.672]  Your body will be very grateful.
[01:31:53.672 --> 01:31:56.714]  On the web at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:31:56.714 --> 01:31:58.475]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:32:01.334 --> 01:32:02.895]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.895 --> 01:32:08.797]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:32:08.797 --> 01:32:11.358]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:32:11.358 --> 01:32:17.161]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:32:17.161 --> 01:32:22.863]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:32:23.303 --> 01:32:26.264]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:32:26.264 --> 01:32:31.826]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:32:31.826 --> 01:32:38.848]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:32:38.848 --> 01:32:43.389]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:46.972]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:32:46.972 --> 01:32:49.054]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:32:49.054 --> 01:32:54.798]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:32:54.798 --> 01:32:57.220]  Check it out at PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:02.144]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:33:02.144 --> 01:33:04.747]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.612 --> 01:33:28.405]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[01:33:28.405 --> 01:33:33.251]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:47.661]  All right, for the next 30 minutes, we're honored to have one of my favorite guests, and one of your favorite guests I know, Dr. Michael Savage.
[01:33:47.661 --> 01:33:50.862]  He's the media icon in the conservative and Americana movement.
[01:33:50.862 --> 01:33:54.383]  He holds a master's degree in medical botany and a second in medical anthropology.
[01:33:54.383 --> 01:33:55.523]  Additionally, he earned his Ph.D.
[01:33:55.523 --> 01:33:59.464]  from the University of California at Berkeley in epidemiology and nutrition sciences.
[01:33:59.464 --> 01:34:02.745]  He is the author of 25 books, including four New York Times bestsellers.
[01:34:02.745 --> 01:34:03.585]  I think it's more than that now.
[01:34:04.065 --> 01:34:12.327]  He earned the coveted Freedom of Speech Award from Talkers Magazine 2007. michaelsavage.com, michaelsavage.wnd.com.
[01:34:12.327 --> 01:34:27.191]  And the reason we're all here with Trump in office is our audience, Matt Drudge, Michael Savage, and Donald Trump putting out the truth, breaking down the facts, and you can see in everything Trump does and what Stephen Bannon does, Michael Savage
[01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:28.352]  Right there.
[01:34:28.352 --> 01:34:31.074]  And it's not about giving him credit because he doesn't care.
[01:34:31.074 --> 01:34:32.875]  He doesn't need the money or the accolades.
[01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:36.979]  It's about what's winning and what the truth is and our superior ideology.
[01:34:36.979 --> 01:34:44.305]  When I say superior, they want to ban the ideology of Americana and Renaissance because compared to theirs, I mean, it's like North Korean ideology.
[01:34:44.305 --> 01:34:48.128]  Banning whiteboards at universities all over because someone might write something bad.
[01:34:48.128 --> 01:34:50.330]  That's beyond burning books.
[01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:52.712]  We're entering a new level all over the country.
[01:34:52.712 --> 01:34:54.593]  Can't wear American flags in a basketball game.
[01:34:54.593 --> 01:34:55.454]  It hurts the Muslims.
[01:34:55.814 --> 01:34:56.875]  Well, then they shouldn't be here.
[01:34:56.875 --> 01:34:57.955]  They are hurt by a flag.
[01:34:57.955 --> 01:34:59.296]  I thought you want to be Americans.
[01:34:59.296 --> 01:35:00.656]  So joining us is Michael Savage.
[01:35:00.656 --> 01:35:01.937]  I asked him, what do you want to talk about?
[01:35:01.937 --> 01:35:03.158]  We talked 30 seconds before he came on.
[01:35:03.158 --> 01:35:04.418]  He said, censorship.
[01:35:04.418 --> 01:35:07.260]  And I was like, wow, that's the first thing I wanted to hit.
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:11.302]  German official wants $53 million fine for fake news.
[01:35:12.382 --> 01:35:13.183]  Or hate posts!
[01:35:13.183 --> 01:35:15.145]  And that, of course, we're already getting banned in Europe.
[01:35:15.145 --> 01:35:16.907]  Twitter, Facebook are blocking our posts.
[01:35:16.907 --> 01:35:19.189]  Google kicked us off Google Ads two weeks ago.
[01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:23.153]  That was set to basically be the profit we would have this year to fund our operation.
[01:35:23.153 --> 01:35:24.094]  We're under attack.
[01:35:24.094 --> 01:35:26.096]  Savage is being blacklisted.
[01:35:26.096 --> 01:35:28.118]  Dr. Michael Savage joins us.
[01:35:28.118 --> 01:35:30.300]  Thank you so much for coming on with us, Doc.
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:31.381]  I kind of set the table there.
[01:35:31.381 --> 01:35:32.182]  Where do you want to go first?
[01:35:32.881 --> 01:35:36.445]  Who is the Nazi in Germany who pretends to be a nice guy?
[01:35:36.445 --> 01:35:42.131]  Who's the Nazi in Germany who wants the $53 million fine for expressing a different opinion?
[01:35:42.131 --> 01:35:43.633]  Who is this neo-Nazi?
[01:35:43.633 --> 01:35:47.757]  That's one of the ministers and that's one of the leaders of one of the major political parties.
[01:35:47.757 --> 01:35:53.944]  That's Justice Minister Jaco Maas, a member of the center-left Social Democratic Party.
[01:35:54.744 --> 01:35:57.507]  Wait a minute, what do you mean center-left Social Democratic Party?
[01:35:57.507 --> 01:36:02.551]  The National Socialism was a center-left Social Democratic Party under Adolf Hitler.
[01:36:02.551 --> 01:36:03.872]  That's right.
[01:36:03.872 --> 01:36:12.280]  And we have the same thing in America now, called the Democrat Socialist Islamist Party of America, under the guise of fairness for all.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.441]  Look, it's a war.
[01:36:13.441 --> 01:36:16.524]  It's a civil war, God darn it, I'm sick of it.
[01:36:16.524 --> 01:36:20.648]  I'm sick of them picking up sticks and beating up old women and calling it anti-fascism.
[01:36:21.974 --> 01:36:31.603]  When are the Hells Angels and the Plumbers going to join the front lines and show those left-wing slime bags what fascism really looks like?
[01:36:31.603 --> 01:36:32.103]  I agree.
[01:36:32.103 --> 01:36:37.248]  Snoop Dogg puts out a video, Viacom promotes it, saying, kill the president, kill police officers.
[01:36:37.248 --> 01:36:41.352]  And at a certain point, we're not looking for violence, but they're organizing violence against America.
[01:36:41.352 --> 01:36:47.778]  I mean, when are people going to start falling down and hitting their heads so they learn they're pushing for revolution in a war, they're going to get one.
[01:36:49.542 --> 01:36:51.963]  Well, Alex, we're there already.
[01:36:51.963 --> 01:36:53.263]  The war has started.
[01:36:53.263 --> 01:36:54.383]  We're in the Civil War.
[01:36:54.383 --> 01:36:56.804]  There's no question about it.
[01:36:56.804 --> 01:36:59.625]  Who's winning, though, is the question.
[01:36:59.625 --> 01:37:00.825]  Who is really winning?
[01:37:00.825 --> 01:37:02.466]  We elected the President.
[01:37:02.466 --> 01:37:04.666]  We allegedly own the Senate.
[01:37:04.666 --> 01:37:05.927]  We have the House.
[01:37:05.927 --> 01:37:07.367]  And we're getting nothing done.
[01:37:07.367 --> 01:37:09.167]  No tax cuts.
[01:37:09.167 --> 01:37:11.788]  Not a brick laid for the wall.
[01:37:11.788 --> 01:37:12.828]  What's been done?
[01:37:12.828 --> 01:37:14.689]  Because they're obstructionists, as you well know.
[01:37:15.919 --> 01:37:18.601]  So, I don't want to just keep going back to Trump swore the book.
[01:37:18.601 --> 01:37:19.541]  Trump swore the book.
[01:37:19.541 --> 01:37:20.222]  No, but that's it.
[01:37:20.222 --> 01:37:25.865]  You said a month before the election, the last time you were here, if he wins, the real war starts.
[01:37:25.865 --> 01:37:28.587]  This stupid Obamacare now became Trumpcare.
[01:37:28.587 --> 01:37:30.308]  They're not really repealing it.
[01:37:30.308 --> 01:37:35.231]  Savage came up with a solution, which is in Trump's war, and I discussed it on my radio show yesterday.
[01:37:35.231 --> 01:37:36.652]  Everybody should get the book.
[01:37:36.652 --> 01:37:39.714]  Alex, listen, this is so commonsensical, no one's picked up on it.
[01:37:39.714 --> 01:37:42.656]  It makes so much sense that people are ignoring it.
[01:37:43.437 --> 01:37:47.779]  Savage says put high-risk individuals in high-risk insurance pools.
[01:37:47.779 --> 01:37:52.181]  That's what my dad says, and he ran medical companies for decades.
[01:37:52.181 --> 01:37:56.202]  If you're a driver, you pay higher rates if you had accidents.
[01:37:56.202 --> 01:38:03.765]  If you go for any kind of insurance... If you're an astronaut, if you're a deep-water welder, you pay because you're in a high-risk pool.
[01:38:03.765 --> 01:38:07.047]  That's what I'm saying, so why shouldn't it apply to Trumpcare?
[01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:09.988]  High-risk individuals, high-risk pools.
[01:38:11.334 --> 01:38:13.215]  You have multiple sex partners every week?
[01:38:13.215 --> 01:38:14.696]  You go in a high-risk pool!
[01:38:14.696 --> 01:38:16.797]  You shouldn't pay the same as a grandmother who goes to church every week.
[01:38:16.797 --> 01:38:17.797]  You smoke three packs of cigarettes a day?
[01:38:17.797 --> 01:38:19.558]  You go in a high-risk pool?
[01:38:19.558 --> 01:38:20.119]  Crazy.
[01:38:20.119 --> 01:38:22.040]  Why is this not being picked up?
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:27.823]  I hope after your show, the headline is, Savage says, high-risk pools for high-risk individuals to save Trumpcare.
[01:38:27.823 --> 01:38:28.203]  We will.
[01:38:28.203 --> 01:38:29.344]  That's the headline.
[01:38:29.344 --> 01:38:30.344]  I've sent it, by the way.
[01:38:30.344 --> 01:38:31.965]  I've sent it to Donald Trump.
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:34.863]  Via some internal, you know, routing.
[01:38:52.316 --> 01:38:53.737]  Politics is a compromise.
[01:38:53.737 --> 01:38:55.878]  He knows he has to get things done.
[01:38:55.878 --> 01:38:59.840]  The question is, this is too big an issue to compromise on.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:05.263]  And one of the signature pieces of the campaign was, we're going to repeal Obamacare, right?
[01:39:05.263 --> 01:39:08.185]  Well, okay, so the people are very unhappy.
[01:39:08.185 --> 01:39:10.386]  And we need to gut the whole thing and start all over again.
[01:39:10.386 --> 01:39:17.570]  I am sick and tired of people who lead healthy lifestyles, clean lifestyles, if you want to put it that way.
[01:39:18.231 --> 01:39:22.373]  Paying the same as illegal immigrants who by the way should have no health care.
[01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:35.020]  My dad and mom hadn't used their insurance in over 20 years and as soon as this came in they doubled their prices and so my parents are paying higher prices and then people that have been milking the system they're paying lower.
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:35.561]  It's incredible.
[01:39:36.121 --> 01:39:39.523]  Trump's war, his battle for America, the number one New York Times bestselling author.
[01:39:39.523 --> 01:39:40.624]  Tell us about the book summit.
[01:39:40.624 --> 01:39:41.845]  I know you're a hard guy to get on.
[01:39:41.845 --> 01:39:47.248]  I really hope you'll come on more and sometime really get into the, you know, your whole philosophy and, you know, where everything's going.
[01:39:47.248 --> 01:39:51.030]  Because I used to hear you 15 years ago on the air and agree, you know, agree with like 80 percent.
[01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:54.372]  Now you're like 95 percent or 90 percent, you know, 98 percent.
[01:39:54.372 --> 01:39:57.514]  It's just crazy how you warned about the left and Islam merging.
[01:39:57.514 --> 01:39:58.995]  And I thought they'd never do that.
[01:39:58.995 --> 01:40:01.897]  But they've done it and they're just opening Europe and all of it.
[01:40:01.897 --> 01:40:02.497]  It's just crazy.
[01:40:03.786 --> 01:40:10.289]  I said that the progressives would align with the Islamists to destroy the West.
[01:40:10.289 --> 01:40:12.950]  And of course, that's what's happening.
[01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:16.992]  And the Democrat Socialist Islamist Party is what they have become.
[01:40:16.992 --> 01:40:22.774]  How can you explain people of Jewish heritage in the Democrat Party so enamored of Islam?
[01:40:22.774 --> 01:40:24.475]  Can you explain that to me?
[01:40:24.475 --> 01:40:29.517]  Why is Schumer so obsessed with making certain that more Islamists... I think it's flirting with suicide.
[01:40:29.517 --> 01:40:30.377]  I think it's nihilistic.
[01:40:30.377 --> 01:40:31.398]  What you said, it's cuckolding.
[01:40:33.409 --> 01:40:37.993]  Well, liberalism is a mental disorder, that we understand, but there's something else to this picture.
[01:40:37.993 --> 01:40:40.576]  I don't know that it's purely suicidal.
[01:40:40.576 --> 01:40:42.277]  It may be something else.
[01:40:42.277 --> 01:40:47.402]  Voting, voting blocs, I know in San Francisco... Oh sure, they want Balkanization, but Islam isn't going to do that.
[01:40:47.402 --> 01:40:53.207]  Look how Erdogan's trying to threaten all of Europe, let him set up political movements inside, and now threatening more refugees.
[01:40:53.207 --> 01:40:57.491]  I mean, he's just... It's the arrogance of these people!
[01:40:57.491 --> 01:40:59.613]  It's a war, Alex, and we're losing it.
[01:41:00.527 --> 01:41:02.568]  Unfortunately, the West is losing.
[01:41:02.568 --> 01:41:05.228]  Trump is our only hope right now.
[01:41:05.228 --> 01:41:09.249]  And I'm not sure he's going to win without a popular movement to support him.
[01:41:09.249 --> 01:41:17.752]  And here's what I want to say to all those people who stabbed him for nine months during the campaign, then suddenly became his supporters after he won.
[01:41:17.752 --> 01:41:19.972]  They were suddenly big Trump supporters.
[01:41:19.972 --> 01:41:23.353]  Two minutes later, now they're stabbing him in the back again.
[01:41:23.353 --> 01:41:25.374]  Okay, it is either you're for him or you're against him.
[01:41:25.374 --> 01:41:25.934]  How's that?
[01:41:25.934 --> 01:41:26.734]  Let me explain why.
[01:41:28.206 --> 01:41:38.331]  Even if we only get 10 or 20% of what he promised, that's 10 or 20% more than 110 or 120% more than we would have had with the she-witch had she had won.
[01:41:38.331 --> 01:41:39.532]  First Amendment.
[01:41:39.532 --> 01:41:41.673]  He's not taking away freedom of speech.
[01:41:41.673 --> 01:41:42.894]  He's not taking away talk radio.
[01:41:42.894 --> 01:41:45.995]  She said she would do the Fairness Doctrine and eliminate me on the radio.
[01:41:45.995 --> 01:41:48.597]  And others in the media like you.
[01:41:48.597 --> 01:41:49.537]  You'd be gone.
[01:41:49.537 --> 01:41:50.238]  The Internet would be gone.
[01:41:50.238 --> 01:41:50.938]  They said that was the goal!
[01:41:51.696 --> 01:41:53.977]  Okay, so we have the First Amendment under Trump.
[01:41:53.977 --> 01:41:55.138]  Guns are not being seized.
[01:41:55.138 --> 01:41:56.719]  They would have been seized under Hillary.
[01:41:56.719 --> 01:41:57.860]  One way or another.
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:01.562]  But Gordon, is 44% down just in 50 days the illegals?
[01:42:01.562 --> 01:42:07.446]  Well, what I'm saying is, we have the First and Second Amendments.
[01:42:07.446 --> 01:42:09.507]  Why are these people stabbing Trump in the back?
[01:42:09.507 --> 01:42:11.308]  I'm not talking about the progressives.
[01:42:11.308 --> 01:42:12.309]  No, his own people.
[01:42:12.309 --> 01:42:13.349]  The Republicans.
[01:42:13.349 --> 01:42:15.911]  I'm talking about the fake conservatives in the media, Alex!
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:19.342]  Oh, you watch Fox News, it's all backhanded attacks.
[01:42:19.342 --> 01:42:23.146]  We should all turn against them and not support them and not watch their crap.
[01:42:23.146 --> 01:42:25.728]  Have you ever been on Fox News?
[01:42:25.728 --> 01:42:30.913]  Years ago they told me I was banned off of it, but they don't have that many viewers and I'm that big of a response.
[01:42:30.913 --> 01:42:34.877]  You may have a bigger audience in your time slot than the lame ducks do on their network.
[01:42:34.877 --> 01:42:36.798]  Oh, there's no doubt you do and I do.
[01:42:36.798 --> 01:42:38.540]  I'm banned on Fox News.
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:39.441]  I'm banned in Britain.
[01:42:39.441 --> 01:42:41.663]  So what does that tell us about Rupert Murdoch's politics?
[01:42:42.404 --> 01:42:44.105]  What is Moloch really doing here?
[01:42:44.105 --> 01:42:45.426]  Is Moloch really supporting?
[01:42:45.426 --> 01:42:48.048]  Michael Savage, let me say bye to you during the break or see if you don't have another interview coming.
[01:42:48.048 --> 01:42:48.688]  You probably gotta go.
[01:42:48.688 --> 01:42:50.369]  You're always... No, no, let's stay.
[01:42:50.369 --> 01:42:51.070]  Let's keep doing this.
[01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:51.530]  Let's do it.
[01:42:51.530 --> 01:42:51.850]  Stay there.
[01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:53.091]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:53.091 --> 01:42:55.633]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:42:55.633 --> 01:42:58.315]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:43:00.751 --> 01:43:07.815]  I'm very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:43:07.815 --> 01:43:21.043]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:43:21.963 --> 01:43:33.879]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:43:33.879 --> 01:43:39.826]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:43:40.587 --> 01:43:49.595]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:43:49.595 --> 01:43:57.783]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:43:59.676 --> 01:44:01.557]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:44:01.557 --> 01:44:03.598]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:44:03.598 --> 01:44:06.499]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:44:06.499 --> 01:44:12.562]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:44:12.562 --> 01:44:21.745]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:44:21.745 --> 01:44:25.027]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[01:44:25.287 --> 01:44:29.290]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:37.316]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:44:37.316 --> 01:44:38.397]  The general public doesn't.
[01:44:39.481 --> 01:44:42.865]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:44:42.865 --> 01:44:47.010]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:44:47.010 --> 01:44:53.718]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:44:53.718 --> 01:44:57.843]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:01.297 --> 01:45:03.138]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:45:03.138 --> 01:45:09.720]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:12.881]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:45:12.881 --> 01:45:22.665]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:45:22.665 --> 01:45:23.525]  Caveman.
[01:45:23.525 --> 01:45:28.587]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:45:28.587 --> 01:45:30.688]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:45:30.988 --> 01:45:34.131]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:45:34.131 --> 01:45:39.295]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:45:39.295 --> 01:45:47.441]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:55.388]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:45:55.388 --> 01:46:00.032]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in fourwarslife.com today.
[01:46:00.902 --> 01:46:02.983]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:46:02.983 --> 01:46:04.444]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[01:46:04.444 --> 01:46:07.085]  We've had an Easter Special that I've decided to extend for another week.
[01:46:07.085 --> 01:46:11.327]  It is a great, empowering thing for me, personally, being under Global Sonslaught.
[01:46:11.327 --> 01:46:15.349]  And as the enemy turns up the wattage, every action has an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:46:15.349 --> 01:46:18.411]  God, or the good force in the universe, turns up my power.
[01:46:18.411 --> 01:46:19.271]  So let me explain something.
[01:46:19.271 --> 01:46:20.452]  This is a great voyage.
[01:46:20.692 --> 01:46:20.952]  I'm on.
[01:46:20.952 --> 01:46:22.253]  And I know you're on it with me.
[01:46:22.253 --> 01:46:26.836]  The animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is the paramount vehicle.
[01:46:26.836 --> 01:46:31.739]  This whole world is a test and this experiment that we're all part of is key.
[01:46:31.739 --> 01:46:33.821]  You're conscious and alive and you care.
[01:46:33.821 --> 01:46:41.386]  And the fact that you're even involved and are even searching for the truth shows you're conscious and haven't been pulled under by these dark forces that now dominate our world.
[01:46:41.386 --> 01:46:46.689]  So whether you get our great products and support the broadcast, whether you pray for us, whether you just spread the word about the links, it doesn't matter.
[01:46:46.689 --> 01:46:49.251]  Just being conscious and awake connects us all together.
[01:46:49.251 --> 01:46:50.552]  And this is an incredible moment to be alive.
[01:46:50.592 --> 01:46:53.154]  I'm Alex Jones with the entire InfoWars.com family.
[01:46:53.154 --> 01:47:02.619]  InfoWarsLive.com saluting all of you, no matter what color your skin is, where you came from in the world, or what your religious background is, we are unstoppable together.
[01:47:02.619 --> 01:47:05.241]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.389 --> 01:47:21.970]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:21.970 --> 01:47:25.671]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:25.671 --> 01:47:32.353]  Michael Savage, of course, hosts his own top radio show every day, best-selling author of the new book Trump's War.
[01:47:32.353 --> 01:47:33.913]  Writes for WorldNetDaily.com as well.
[01:47:33.913 --> 01:47:35.614]  MichaelSavage.com is his site.
[01:47:35.614 --> 01:47:45.576]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com, but he really does know his stuff across the board and has been a visionary when it comes to defending this republic.
[01:47:46.156 --> 01:47:48.337]  And just think about what a loss to Hillary would have been like.
[01:47:48.337 --> 01:47:49.938]  They were coming after the free press.
[01:47:49.938 --> 01:47:52.400]  They said they were coming after me by name.
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.960]  They were coming after everybody.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:59.123]  All the stuff you see in Europe was going to... She was going to put five times more of these refugees into the country.
[01:47:59.123 --> 01:48:00.884]  It's an attempt to fully break us.
[01:48:00.884 --> 01:48:01.565]  Cloward and Pivot.
[01:48:02.265 --> 01:48:06.947]  And so Michael Savage is going to give us 10 more minutes and I said just you know you take over because I'll interrupt.
[01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:16.950]  I want him to just stream of consciousness in Trump's war, that's our war, that ties into Le Pen and everybody else, where this is going, how we defeat these parasites and how we wake up the people.
[01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:17.490]  Dr. Savage.
[01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:18.810]  Simple motto.
[01:48:18.810 --> 01:48:20.071]  Borders, language, culture.
[01:48:20.071 --> 01:48:21.491]  Without that, there is no nation.
[01:48:21.491 --> 01:48:22.311]  Period.
[01:48:22.311 --> 01:48:22.871]  Hillary.
[01:48:22.871 --> 01:48:24.612]  Democrats want to dissolve the borders.
[01:48:24.612 --> 01:48:25.272]  Is that what they want?
[01:48:25.272 --> 01:48:25.992]  To open borders?
[01:48:25.992 --> 01:48:27.973]  Is that what the snake Obama did?
[01:48:27.973 --> 01:48:28.273]  Yes.
[01:48:28.273 --> 01:48:29.393]  No borders.
[01:48:29.393 --> 01:48:30.233]  Oh, language?
[01:48:30.233 --> 01:48:32.054]  Oh, English is just another language.
[01:48:32.054 --> 01:48:33.794]  It's not the language of the land.
[01:48:33.794 --> 01:48:34.174]  Culture?
[01:48:34.174 --> 01:48:35.054]  You have no culture.
[01:48:35.054 --> 01:48:37.035]  The third world has superior culture.
[01:48:37.035 --> 01:48:39.195]  You Americans are culturalists.
[01:48:39.195 --> 01:48:40.936]  You have no class.
[01:48:40.936 --> 01:48:41.916]  Screw them all.
[01:48:41.916 --> 01:48:43.036]  Borders, language, culture.
[01:48:43.036 --> 01:48:45.457]  That's what defines America and every nation on earth.
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:55.047]  Every nation on earth is defined by a border the same way a human cell or an animal cell is defined by a cell membrane.
[01:48:55.047 --> 01:48:57.409]  How many times do I have to say the same thing?
[01:48:57.409 --> 01:49:00.852]  God knows that even a plant cell has a cell wall.
[01:49:00.852 --> 01:49:05.116]  Without a cell wall, there's no differential between the cells and a plant.
[01:49:05.116 --> 01:49:06.717]  Same with nations.
[01:49:06.717 --> 01:49:07.398]  Same with people.
[01:49:07.398 --> 01:49:08.519]  Don't you love this, Alex?
[01:49:08.519 --> 01:49:10.300]  I was thinking about this in my sleep.
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:11.882]  The liberals want to dissolve borders.
[01:49:12.597 --> 01:49:14.459]  Meaning they want to dissolve the national identity.
[01:49:14.459 --> 01:49:17.742]  We should have no self-respect for our nation.
[01:49:17.742 --> 01:49:22.526]  But we should have total self-esteem if we're a junkie or a sexual deviant?
[01:49:22.526 --> 01:49:27.331]  The sicker you are in America, you're supposed to have self-esteem no matter what you do?
[01:49:27.331 --> 01:49:29.033]  Self-esteem if you're a drug addict?
[01:49:29.033 --> 01:49:30.134]  Why should you have self-esteem?
[01:49:30.134 --> 01:49:31.835]  You're a loser.
[01:49:31.835 --> 01:49:33.797]  Okay, what do you mean self-esteem if you're a drug addict?
[01:49:33.797 --> 01:49:34.678]  You have no self-esteem.
[01:49:34.678 --> 01:49:35.379]  You're a nobody.
[01:49:35.379 --> 01:49:36.620]  They want to get rid of excellence.
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:37.721]  They want to get rid of competition.
[01:49:38.274 --> 01:49:41.296]  Well, that's affirmative action, which is a way to dissolve excellence.
[01:49:41.296 --> 01:49:44.078]  But let's not go into that little topic for now.
[01:49:44.078 --> 01:49:45.459]  Borders language culture.
[01:49:45.459 --> 01:49:49.122]  That's the essence of a national identity.
[01:49:49.122 --> 01:49:56.347]  If you want an individual to have individual pride in his achievements or her achievements, you should have the same for a nation.
[01:49:56.347 --> 01:49:58.769]  This is a great exceptional nation.
[01:49:58.769 --> 01:50:01.971]  And that's what we're supposed to have under Donald Trump.
[01:50:01.971 --> 01:50:03.772]  National pride.
[01:50:03.772 --> 01:50:05.514]  America first.
[01:50:05.514 --> 01:50:07.215]  And that is why the left is going berserk.
[01:50:07.975 --> 01:50:10.237]  Because they thought they had it done.
[01:50:10.237 --> 01:50:11.638]  It was over.
[01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:15.381]  They owned every country on Earth, with rare exception.
[01:50:15.381 --> 01:50:17.163]  They almost had it all.
[01:50:17.163 --> 01:50:18.344]  They almost had all the marbles.
[01:50:18.344 --> 01:50:19.244]  They almost had America.
[01:50:19.244 --> 01:50:20.025]  They thought it was a lock.
[01:50:20.025 --> 01:50:21.386]  They thought she was going to win.
[01:50:21.386 --> 01:50:24.088]  The only thing a knockdown would have been all Russia.
[01:50:24.088 --> 01:50:27.151]  We'll go into that at another time, why they hate Russia so much.
[01:50:27.151 --> 01:50:29.753]  There are many more elements to this to meet the eye.
[01:50:29.753 --> 01:50:31.815]  But once they had America, who was left?
[01:50:31.815 --> 01:50:32.295]  Israel?
[01:50:32.295 --> 01:50:32.635]  Nothing.
[01:50:32.635 --> 01:50:33.536]  A fly on the wall.
[01:50:35.174 --> 01:50:39.640]  A nationalist nation, Jewish identity, they can get rid of that one easily.
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.243]  Russia would have been a little harder, but they would have gotten rid of that too.
[01:50:42.243 --> 01:50:46.649]  One world, new world order, here we go, the USSR is back.
[01:50:46.649 --> 01:50:50.574]  Only now it's the USS of A run by a bunch of degenerate child molesters in Brussels.
[01:50:51.657 --> 01:50:53.659]  We almost lost it, Alex.
[01:50:53.659 --> 01:50:57.081]  And that's why the illegitimate, perverted left is going insane.
[01:50:57.081 --> 01:50:57.501]  You're right.
[01:50:57.501 --> 01:50:58.262]  It's Trump's war.
[01:50:58.262 --> 01:50:58.862]  It's our war.
[01:50:58.862 --> 01:50:59.683]  It's nationalism.
[01:50:59.683 --> 01:51:00.963]  It's the return of prosperity.
[01:51:00.963 --> 01:51:02.945]  Just common sense, not left or right.
[01:51:02.945 --> 01:51:03.865]  I mean, it's there.
[01:51:03.865 --> 01:51:06.267]  And people need to know, the war isn't over.
[01:51:06.267 --> 01:51:07.127]  It's just begun.
[01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:08.849]  We've all got to be more involved than ever.
[01:51:08.849 --> 01:51:12.311]  Soros is doubling the amount of money he's putting out.
[01:51:12.311 --> 01:51:15.813]  Soros needs to be tried.
[01:51:15.813 --> 01:51:18.295]  Soros has, in my opinion, committed many crimes.
[01:51:19.267 --> 01:51:20.608]  Soros has meddled in elections.
[01:51:20.608 --> 01:51:22.329]  We keep hearing about Russia meddling in elections.
[01:51:22.329 --> 01:51:25.611]  He should be locked up for being a Nazi collaborator 65 years ago!
[01:51:25.611 --> 01:51:26.652]  Let's put that aside.
[01:51:26.652 --> 01:51:28.794]  No one will ever believe that.
[01:51:28.794 --> 01:51:40.702]  But they will come to understand with a Senate hearing how this emigre, immigrant to America, gave $65 million to the violent Black Lives Matter movement.
[01:51:40.702 --> 01:51:42.943]  And I have five pages in Trump's war.
[01:51:42.943 --> 01:51:44.704]  You have to see this, Alex.
[01:51:44.704 --> 01:51:45.585]  I don't know if you saw this.
[01:51:46.295 --> 01:51:50.759]  I named every subversive group in America that receives money from George Soros.
[01:51:50.759 --> 01:51:51.459]  Listen to me.
[01:51:51.459 --> 01:51:52.800]  This is the most important part of the book.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.521]  You triggered me now.
[01:51:53.521 --> 01:51:56.083]  Remember I said don't say anything about an airplane?
[01:51:56.083 --> 01:51:58.805]  All you have to do is say Soros and I'm off and running at the races.
[01:51:58.805 --> 01:51:59.685]  Me too.
[01:51:59.685 --> 01:52:06.070]  I have five pages of every group in America that receives money from this man.
[01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:10.494]  These are the groups that need to be investigated with the new UAC, House Un-American Activities Committee.
[01:52:11.024 --> 01:52:14.065]  Do you know how that would scare your friends in Hollywood, Alex?
[01:52:14.065 --> 01:52:15.226]  A new HUAC?
[01:52:15.226 --> 01:52:17.267]  They'd scream, BLACKLIST!
[01:52:17.267 --> 01:52:18.608]  BLACKLIST!
[01:52:18.608 --> 01:52:19.588]  BLACKLIST!
[01:52:19.588 --> 01:52:21.709]  I'm on the blacklist, they put me on it.
[01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:23.290]  They admit you came and fly to England!
[01:52:24.594 --> 01:52:26.856]  You're on a blacklist.
[01:52:26.856 --> 01:52:31.498]  They're afraid of really being put on a blacklist where they belong for subverting the United States of America.
[01:52:31.498 --> 01:52:33.159]  And by the way, we're not the authoritarians.
[01:52:33.159 --> 01:52:35.801]  They're the ones saying arrest us, kill us, kill Trump.
[01:52:35.801 --> 01:52:36.882]  They started the fight.
[01:52:36.882 --> 01:52:37.902]  They drew first blood.
[01:52:37.902 --> 01:52:40.064]  In fact, I want to ask you about that in the few minutes we have here.
[01:52:40.064 --> 01:52:41.765]  Again, the book's available everywhere, Trump's War.
[01:52:41.765 --> 01:52:43.086]  It's an act of resistance.
[01:52:43.086 --> 01:52:43.906]  Get it for yourself.
[01:52:43.906 --> 01:52:44.426]  Read it.
[01:52:44.426 --> 01:52:45.267]  Get a couple copies.
[01:52:45.267 --> 01:52:46.528]  Pass it on to friends and family.
[01:52:47.128 --> 01:52:48.190]  Well, let me say this in closing.
[01:52:48.190 --> 01:52:51.717]  I know you've heard anybody's interviews and they're like 10 minutes long.
[01:52:51.717 --> 01:52:54.101]  I know you're a busy guy and I appreciate you, Dr. Savage.
[01:52:54.101 --> 01:52:55.844]  The book is Trump's War, michaelsavage.com.
[01:52:57.333 --> 01:53:08.359]  I just can't believe every day, because I'm not out to get people, I don't like con artists, you don't like con artists, that the left, because I don't like the Republicans either, like you say, the biggest threat is the RINOs, but at least they know what's going on.
[01:53:08.359 --> 01:53:14.502]  How are we ruled by Pelosi that thinks George W. Bush is still in office at press conferences and Maxine Waters at the same press conferences?
[01:53:14.502 --> 01:53:16.844]  Russia invaded Korea, not North or South.
[01:53:17.384 --> 01:53:30.030]  I mean, it makes me feel pathetic that we're ruled by such mental midgets and how they have all these minions and how this just keeps going on forever when all Trump and you and everybody you're doing is trying to have prosperity and freedom.
[01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:31.190]  I mean, we're good guys.
[01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:32.891]  We really know policy.
[01:53:32.891 --> 01:53:34.952]  We're really promoting freedom.
[01:53:34.952 --> 01:53:36.373]  We really want to have a country.
[01:53:36.373 --> 01:53:37.893]  And then there's all these jerks.
[01:53:37.893 --> 01:53:43.176]  I just don't, I can't believe, it's almost like a hallucination that we're ruled by these mental patients.
[01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:45.378]  Look Alex, the big battle is here.
[01:53:45.378 --> 01:53:45.938]  It's now.
[01:53:45.938 --> 01:53:46.859]  We're in it.
[01:53:46.859 --> 01:53:48.100]  The battle lines have been drawn.
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:49.301]  The barricades are up.
[01:53:49.301 --> 01:53:52.043]  Never go full Maxine Waters!
[01:53:52.043 --> 01:53:53.965]  They're throwing bricks at us.
[01:53:53.965 --> 01:53:55.686]  They're beating up old women and old men.
[01:53:55.686 --> 01:53:57.528]  And we're not fighting back.
[01:53:59.051 --> 01:54:01.353]  When did the gloves come off, Alex?
[01:54:01.353 --> 01:54:02.754]  You know, that's the final point.
[01:54:02.754 --> 01:54:03.854]  I appreciate the time.
[01:54:03.854 --> 01:54:05.516]  I sit here, because I've never called for violence.
[01:54:05.516 --> 01:54:08.858]  I've never called for stuff, you know, like they do against us.
[01:54:08.858 --> 01:54:13.301]  But when they're, every newspaper, every major entertainer is like saying, kill Trump.
[01:54:13.301 --> 01:54:16.783]  And I just don't get all these wimps trying to pretend they're about to have a war with us.
[01:54:16.783 --> 01:54:20.446]  So I ask you, how long does Trump sit there and put up with it?
[01:54:20.446 --> 01:54:22.687]  Because quite frankly, I don't know what to do.
[01:54:22.687 --> 01:54:23.748]  I don't know what to do.
[01:54:23.748 --> 01:54:25.309]  Oh, I have many answers, Billy.
[01:54:25.309 --> 01:54:26.490]  I'm not throwing my hands up.
[01:54:27.034 --> 01:54:28.335]  There are laws on the books.
[01:54:28.335 --> 01:54:30.897]  You cross state lines to provoke a riot, you go to jail.
[01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:32.458]  It's a violation of federal law.
[01:54:32.458 --> 01:54:34.600]  Put in place after the riots of the 60s.
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:35.301]  That's number one.
[01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:39.664]  Number two, you gotta defund all the groups that Soros is funding.
[01:54:39.664 --> 01:54:42.667]  You gotta put in voter ID laws in every state of the union.
[01:54:42.667 --> 01:54:45.309]  Because we have a new man in the Justice Department who can do it.
[01:54:45.309 --> 01:54:46.970]  That's why they try to stop him.
[01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:49.793]  Voter ID laws will save us.
[01:54:49.793 --> 01:54:52.355]  End funding of sanctuary cities.
[01:54:52.355 --> 01:54:53.696]  They'll start self-deporting.
[01:54:54.494 --> 01:54:58.818]  And the cities will capitulate, as Miami did, because they cannot live without federal money.
[01:54:58.818 --> 01:55:03.641]  There are things that can be done with a budget alone that will save this nation.
[01:55:03.641 --> 01:55:07.945]  And you need to be there, and I need to be there, like Stephen Bannon said, to put pressure on.
[01:55:07.945 --> 01:55:14.250]  They need the pressure there to give them cover from the neocons and from the RINOs and the Democrats to get the agenda through.
[01:55:14.250 --> 01:55:17.833]  And I know you've got your own radio show coming up very soon, MichaelSavage.com.
[01:55:17.833 --> 01:55:18.633]  And what is it?
[01:55:18.633 --> 01:55:20.375]  I mean, it's one of the top shows in the world.
[01:55:20.375 --> 01:55:21.836]  Tell folks how they fit into your show.
[01:55:23.675 --> 01:55:29.242]  Well, it's on big radio stations, but streaming-wise, it's the number one talk radio streaming show in America.
[01:55:29.242 --> 01:55:32.947]  I hate to boast, but I will, because if I don't, who will?
[01:55:32.947 --> 01:55:37.894]  According to TalkStream Live, my show has a 25 share of all people listening
[01:55:38.524 --> 01:55:42.525]  To talk radio at any time on their iPhones or devices.
[01:55:42.525 --> 01:55:46.666]  Rush Limbaugh has a 13.7 share at the last analysis.
[01:55:46.666 --> 01:55:50.727]  I'm not knocking, I'm just saying it's an enormous audience that's not reflected.
[01:55:50.727 --> 01:55:53.308]  But Alex, I am subject to advertising boycotts.
[01:55:53.308 --> 01:55:54.508]  I know.
[01:55:54.508 --> 01:55:56.649]  You want to talk about blacklists?
[01:55:56.649 --> 01:55:58.269]  The ad agencies that control radio?
[01:55:58.269 --> 01:55:58.869]  I know.
[01:55:58.869 --> 01:56:00.209]  Believe me.
[01:56:00.209 --> 01:56:01.990]  Five of them control all the ads.
[01:56:02.734 --> 01:56:05.775]  They've put me on a blacklist for 22 years.
[01:56:05.775 --> 01:56:11.677]  No, no, they're trying to keep what's popular from getting to the people, and it's crazy how ratings sometimes don't even count.
[01:56:11.677 --> 01:56:14.038]  Well, I've talked to a big antitrust lawyer about them.
[01:56:14.038 --> 01:56:15.538]  They don't know what's coming, Alex.
[01:56:15.538 --> 01:56:16.498]  Stay tuned.
[01:56:16.498 --> 01:56:25.301]  Within the next year, you may see a revolution in radio when Michael Savage brings the antitrust actions against the agencies that have boycotted him.
[01:56:25.301 --> 01:56:31.183]  Please, I want to join with you because I've been through the same stuff, and I've also... Google just says, you're fake, you can't advertise with us.
[01:56:31.183 --> 01:56:31.483]  It's like...
[01:56:32.023 --> 01:56:33.744]  It's like, literally like Nazi Germany.
[01:56:33.744 --> 01:56:41.727]  Everybody overuses it where they wouldn't let Jews advertise it first, and then it was like, wouldn't have shops, and then... Alex, I've had dinners with the biggest antitrust attorney in America.
[01:56:41.727 --> 01:56:43.807]  He happens to be a lifetime Democrat.
[01:56:43.807 --> 01:56:46.108]  But he hates monopolies.
[01:56:46.108 --> 01:56:48.929]  He despises the big guy crushing the little guy.
[01:56:48.929 --> 01:56:50.690]  Stay tuned.
[01:56:50.690 --> 01:56:52.991]  The game may just change in the courts.
[01:56:52.991 --> 01:56:57.372]  We may take them on where they live the strongest.
[01:56:57.372 --> 01:56:57.812]  Awesome.
[01:56:57.812 --> 01:56:58.312]  Trump's war.
[01:56:58.312 --> 01:56:59.373]  Thank you, Michael Savage, for the time.
[01:57:00.148 --> 01:57:00.989]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:00.989 --> 01:57:01.509]  Love it.
[01:57:01.509 --> 01:57:02.049]  Bye now.
[01:57:02.049 --> 01:57:02.530]  Thank you.
[01:57:02.530 --> 01:57:03.970]  That was a powerful hour.
[01:57:03.970 --> 01:57:05.672]  I skipped two breaks because it was so powerful.
[01:57:05.672 --> 01:57:07.493]  Those are network breaks, but it's okay.
[01:57:07.493 --> 01:57:08.894]  Support our broadcast as well.
[01:57:08.894 --> 01:57:09.454]  We don't bitch.
[01:57:09.454 --> 01:57:10.235]  He doesn't like to complain.
[01:57:10.235 --> 01:57:10.995]  I don't either.
[01:57:10.995 --> 01:57:12.956]  We're under ridiculous attack.
[01:57:12.956 --> 01:57:15.918]  Everybody wants somebody to stand up, get involved, take action.
[01:57:15.918 --> 01:57:16.419]  We're doing it.

[01:57:55.596 --> 01:57:57.698]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:57:57.698 --> 01:58:02.985]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:58:02.985 --> 01:58:06.749]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[01:58:06.829 --> 01:58:10.270]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:13.450]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:58:13.450 --> 01:58:17.331]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:58:17.331 --> 01:58:24.493]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:58:24.493 --> 01:58:29.874]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:58:30.154 --> 01:58:32.196]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[01:58:32.196 --> 01:58:40.503]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.
[01:58:40.503 --> 01:58:48.810]  Learn more about the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[01:59:04.696 --> 01:59:05.417]  We're good to go.
[01:59:23.368 --> 01:59:29.452]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:59:29.452 --> 01:59:30.233]  It works.
[01:59:30.233 --> 01:59:38.678]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[01:59:38.678 --> 01:59:48.425]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the globalists all at the same time.
