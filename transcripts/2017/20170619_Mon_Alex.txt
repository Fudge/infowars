[00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:20.302]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:30.146]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:37.550]  The Bible says that as the end days approach, whether you believe it or not, the Bible says time will speed up.
[00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.271]  People will run to and fro continually.
[00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:43.113]  There'll be so much information no one will know what to do with it.
[00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:53.109]  Like water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink, because despite all the information, the public, on average, will get dumber and dumber.
[00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.872]  The aftermath of the Megyn Kelly interview, we're going to be going over that today.
[00:00:56.872 --> 00:00:59.674]  What it signifies in dinosaur media.
[00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:06.800]  The untold deceptions, the 19-piece, 19-minute piece, it just makes the head swim.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.901]  There's so many lies.
[00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:13.396]  Then, of course, we've got the even bigger news here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:13.396 --> 00:01:19.921]  U.S.-led coalition downing of Syrian plane, act of aggression and support of terrorists.
[00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:24.844]  That's from the Ministry of Defense and from their Foreign Affairs Department.
[00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:26.265]  Russia to target U.S.
[00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:33.190]  planes flying over Syria as targets and shoot them down.
[00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.171]  Russia warns U.S.
[00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:35.792]  not to hit Syrian government troops.
[00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:48.728]  In another report, Russia ends air safety agreement between U.S.-led coalition for Syrian jet shoot-down.
[00:01:48.728 --> 00:01:50.289]  Now, Trump has turned the U.S.
[00:01:50.289 --> 00:02:01.479]  military loose to take out ISIS, but they've been massing artillery, Marines, Army, you name it, in and along on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border.
[00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.380]  We've seen people like
[00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:22.093]  The National Security Advisor, the President, also the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as well as the Secretary of Defense, floating different ideas about taking out Assad and ISIS at the same time.
[00:02:22.093 --> 00:02:26.196]  So this is a very dangerous situation.
[00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:28.818]  McMaster appears to be at the center of it.
[00:02:28.818 --> 00:02:30.379]  I'm not trying to demonize him.
[00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.263]  It's just that's the news that keeps coming out from our sources, and that is later confirmed in the news.
[00:02:35.263 --> 00:02:35.904]  I cannot
[00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:41.929]  stress to people enough how dangerous this is to have this confrontation with Russia.
[00:02:42.958 --> 00:03:08.794]  On Russia's doorstep, in a sovereign country where Russia was invited in, where our government, starting six years ago, via Hillary at the head of the State Department and Obama, launching strikes into the country with paramilitary forces to destabilize it, call the invasion a civil war, back ISIS, back Al-Qaeda, back al-Nusra, trying to overthrow the country.
[00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:10.736]  Our own military refused to go along with it.
[00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:35.512]  Going back about four and a half years ago, so there's been a stalemate, and now that Trump's in, he says, knock out ISIS, but then our military begins to knock out ISIS, but also prepares to basically take the rest of the country with these military moves, and begins targeting and bombing Assad forces on the ground that are battling Wahhabi forces.
[00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:39.015]  And now, shooting down a Syrian aircraft.
[00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:46.139]  This is a US-Russia showdown.
[00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:56.864]  And it's being done by the deep state, not President Trump, who made it clear that he is not going to have troops on the ground to take out Assad.
[00:03:56.864 --> 00:04:01.627]  And we told you that three days before he came out and said that word for word a few months ago.
[00:04:02.503 --> 00:04:04.244]  From our White House sources.
[00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:07.107]  And Trump has been very, very clear about this.
[00:04:07.107 --> 00:04:10.229]  That he doesn't like the fact that the civil war was started there by Obama.
[00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.872]  That he doesn't think the Syrian leadership is offensive or causing a problem.
[00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:16.214]  And that it's not our place to remove them.
[00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:22.800]  And that he wants to basically stabilize the Middle East and put Iran and Saudi Arabia in check.
[00:04:24.172 --> 00:04:26.896]  Remember Trump said no to troops in Syria.
[00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:29.060]  His aides aren't so sure.
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.463]  That was days after we broke that down.
[00:04:31.463 --> 00:04:32.685]  Bloomberg and others laid it out.
[00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:36.311]  The point is we have our sources and I've reached out to them.
[00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:39.376]  I haven't gotten contacted back yet because
[00:04:42.973 --> 00:04:46.879]  It takes time to get in a position to be able to get the information.
[00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.120]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.424]  But we have a bunch of big guests today.
[00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:51.746]  Jesse James is coming on.
[00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:53.688]  We have Mike Cernovich in studio.
[00:04:53.688 --> 00:04:56.512]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:58.415]  Joe Biggs is going to be in studio.
[00:04:58.415 --> 00:04:59.116]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:59.116 --> 00:04:59.556]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.602]  Lost in the constant fake news cycle, we have forgotten the building tensions in Syria.
[00:05:05.602 --> 00:05:10.905]  Until this morning, when news broke of a Syrian Army plane being shot down by a United States F-18.
[00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:15.608]  This is the first Syrian aircraft to have been downed by the United States since 2011.
[00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:23.052]  Washington justified the strike, claiming the jet dropped bombs near U.S.-backed forces, while officials from Damascus said they were attacking ISIS.
[00:05:23.052 --> 00:05:25.773]  Truth be told, these are most likely the same group.
[00:05:25.773 --> 00:05:28.615]  But we should be asking John McCain that question.
[00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:31.457]  Russia has responded by saying it will now treat U.S.
[00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:34.199]  aircraft operating in Syria as targets.
[00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.864]  President Trump can't get a microphone loud enough to ask for the Russia collusion investigation to be over.
[00:05:39.864 --> 00:05:43.847]  But don't hold your breath on the Democrats finding common sense and logic overnight.
[00:05:43.847 --> 00:05:46.589]  President Trump will still be investigated for collusion with Russia.
[00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.112]  While they are threatening him and our country.
[00:05:49.112 --> 00:05:56.501]  President Trump, the globalists are trying to trap you and trick you into a war in Syria in hopes it will cost you the 2020 election.
[00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:57.342]  Don't fall for it.
[00:05:57.342 --> 00:05:58.664]  Make America great again.
[00:05:58.664 --> 00:06:00.787]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:06.139]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:13.865]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:22.493]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:29.118]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:36.723]  To the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:06:36.723 --> 00:06:40.146]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:51.194]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[00:08:18.906 --> 00:08:23.948]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:23.948 --> 00:08:27.710]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:41.317]  Generals gathered in their masses Just like witches at black masses Evil minds that plot destruction
[00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:53.635]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are viewing the collapse of mainstream media, not just here but around the world.
[00:08:53.635 --> 00:09:06.801]  We are witnessing the panicking cultural left, backed by the big multinational combines, openly trying to declare physical and cultural war against anyone that doesn't submit to them.
[00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:09.262]  And we have the big news.
[00:09:09.262 --> 00:09:09.782]  Last night,
[00:09:11.288 --> 00:09:11.648]  The U.S.
[00:09:11.648 --> 00:09:21.775]  military reportedly shot down a Syrian military aircraft in its own airspace for reportedly flying too close to U.S.
[00:09:21.775 --> 00:09:22.315]  forces.
[00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:29.220]  About a month ago, they blew up a convoy that was going into a town controlled by ISIS.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.102]  So a military convoy of armored vehicles and tanks was bombed by the U.S.
[00:09:33.102 --> 00:09:34.383]  military.
[00:09:34.383 --> 00:09:36.605]  And Russia is saying this is basically an act of war.
[00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.951]  They have warned the U.S.
[00:09:38.951 --> 00:09:41.032]  at the downing of Syrian warplanes and say if any U.S.
[00:09:41.032 --> 00:09:44.934]  aircraft enter the airspace now, they're going to shoot it down.
[00:09:44.934 --> 00:09:49.016]  So that is what you call a new Cuban missile crisis.
[00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:55.360]  That is what you call people.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.742]  That is what you call the people of the planet.
[00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:16.262]  Having a very, very serious problem on their hands as the deep state inside of our government attempts to manipulate our country into war.
[00:10:16.262 --> 00:10:17.703]  President Trump is on record.
[00:10:17.703 --> 00:10:19.124]  President Trump is clear.
[00:10:19.124 --> 00:10:22.988]  President Trump does what he says he'll do or he basically dies trying.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.082]  And he said, I want to knock out ISIS, kick them out of Iraq, kick them out of Syria.
[00:10:29.082 --> 00:10:30.583]  They were Obama's problem.
[00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:31.943]  He helped create them with Hillary.
[00:10:31.943 --> 00:10:33.004]  Now I'm the president.
[00:10:33.004 --> 00:10:34.244]  It's my problem.
[00:10:34.244 --> 00:10:41.147]  And every time McMaster's or every time somebody else comes out and says, we're going to take out Assad too, Trump comes out and says, no, you're not.
[00:10:41.147 --> 00:10:44.429]  Our troops are there to remove ISIS and stabilize the country.
[00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:45.669]  We're not removing Assad.
[00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:46.930]  They're going to have elections.
[00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.891]  We already have an agreement.
[00:10:48.891 --> 00:10:50.852]  So clearly this is being done.
[00:10:53.342 --> 00:10:54.723]  To stir things up.
[00:10:54.723 --> 00:11:05.433]  This is being done to try to push our country into war, and this is the biggest threat yet to the Trump presidency, to our recovery, and to real world peace.
[00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:17.484]  Our government, with Saudi Arabia and others, turned loose jihadi Wahhabist fighters in more than 15 countries in the last nine years under Obama.
[00:11:17.484 --> 00:11:19.706]  Trump is now trying to reverse that.
[00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:28.493]  The Arab Spring was run by the criminal elements of the CIA, and by Google, and by Facebook, and by all the usual suspects, and by CNN promoting it.
[00:11:28.493 --> 00:11:30.674]  That's why we say CNN is ISIS.
[00:11:30.674 --> 00:11:38.116]  More folks took the stage in New York last night at Shakespeare in the Park, where they simulated murdering the President, and said CNN is ISIS.
[00:11:38.116 --> 00:11:39.817]  Stop pushing the culture of violence.
[00:11:39.817 --> 00:11:41.017]  Stop pushing death.
[00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:44.659]  Stop doing it.
[00:11:44.659 --> 00:11:47.960]  And so all over, this is beginning to happen more and more.
[00:11:51.471 --> 00:12:04.461]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, we have to ask ourselves, what are we going to do as a people to wake up to the fact that we're being manipulated?
[00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:14.569]  And how are we going to reach out to the mass of folks, upwards of a third of the population of the United States, even higher in Europe, that's still in a trance, that still believes mainstream media is their friend?
[00:12:16.084 --> 00:12:24.727]  Because we can laugh at that 30-40% that don't know their head from a hole in the ground and who can't find their rear end with both hands, but those are our fellow humans.
[00:12:24.727 --> 00:12:34.550]  I don't care what color they are, where they came from, they can be woken up and we need to wake them up because they're being used as a limbing army of destabilization and danger.
[00:12:37.142 --> 00:12:39.122]  So we're going to cover the Russia situation.
[00:12:39.122 --> 00:12:41.823]  We're going to cover the push by leftists for violence.
[00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:46.524]  It's even got Ted Nugent saying, listen, we need to de-escalate this on the right and the left.
[00:12:46.524 --> 00:12:48.885]  He's not saying that out of weakness.
[00:12:48.885 --> 00:12:55.806]  He's saying that out of understanding that these fools don't know how much danger they're in.
[00:12:55.806 --> 00:13:01.948]  And we're trying to take the high road one more time before things get really, really physical.
[00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.688]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:15.841]  Also, Megyn Kelly showed herself to be absolutely, completely, and totally deceptive.
[00:13:15.841 --> 00:13:18.442]  This is a thousand times bigger than Megyn Kelly.
[00:13:18.442 --> 00:13:20.803]  A thousand times bigger than Alex Jones.
[00:13:20.803 --> 00:13:25.184]  This is a hundred times bigger than Donald Trump.
[00:13:25.184 --> 00:13:28.065]  This is about humanity and our destiny and our future.
[00:13:28.065 --> 00:13:33.806]  And it's about MSM, with its billions of dollars per station, crafting lies.
[00:13:33.806 --> 00:13:35.307]  And if you watch the 19-minute piece,
[00:13:37.225 --> 00:13:41.207]  It is one lie from pillar to post, from the start to the finish.
[00:13:41.207 --> 00:13:49.431]  And that's why I can't just start attacking it today, because we're going to basically make a mini-documentary with the behind-the-scenes audio and video.
[00:13:49.431 --> 00:13:56.515]  And we're going to show you lie after lie after lie systematically, so you can see that this is the ultimate lie.
[00:13:56.515 --> 00:13:59.877]  But bigger than that, you can also see it's the ultimate failure.
[00:13:59.877 --> 00:14:04.159]  From putting a heat lamp over my head, to morphing my face and blowing it up big,
[00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.197]  Enlightening her perfectly to saying Trump's a liar.
[00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:08.717]  I'm a liar.
[00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:10.018]  Joe Biggs is a liar.
[00:14:10.018 --> 00:14:14.661]  No drugs come across the Mexico border.
[00:14:14.661 --> 00:14:15.621]  We're not journalists.
[00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:17.883]  That wasn't drugs in those containers.
[00:14:17.883 --> 00:14:19.744]  We talked to the FBI.
[00:14:19.744 --> 00:14:21.485]  We talked to the state police.
[00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:27.309]  We talked to the high-level folks in ICE who told us where to go watch because they've been ordered to stand down.
[00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:45.012]  Joe was briefed by the FBI after this, and he was briefed before the next mission, and he went into Mexico, where they have an Al Qaeda base, an ISIS base, and it was later confirmed one year after that indeed that was an ISIS facility by Judicial Watch.
[00:14:45.012 --> 00:14:48.114]  So, Joe Biggs, our reporter, goes in.
[00:14:48.114 --> 00:14:53.978]  We also first reported that in McAllen, the federal government was shipping people in.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:02.199]  And giving them money to be shipped by Greyhound and other bus wherever they wanted to go in the country to democratic facilities.
[00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.874]  And then later that all broke, you knew it as the quote, migrant crisis, the children.
[00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:10.976]  The media spun up they were children.
[00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:12.077]  17% were under the age of 18.
[00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:14.178]  It was whole families.
[00:15:14.178 --> 00:15:18.822]  And we went into the centers, we went into the facilities, we went and we showed you.
[00:15:18.822 --> 00:15:25.749]  Jakari Jackson showed you, Adon Salazar showed you, Joe Big showed you, I showed you, John Bowne showed you.
[00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:31.734]  We all went to the border and we went in the terminals and we showed you all of it.
[00:15:33.322 --> 00:15:43.971]  We interviewed the local county emergency manager that said, yes, we're ordered to load them in, they're not checked at the border, they come in, we put them onto the vehicle, and we bring them in.
[00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:44.992]  No ID, no nothing.
[00:15:44.992 --> 00:15:51.217]  So, we show that, and Megyn Kelly says, look at the fake journalism.
[00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:55.021]  They claim these men swimming across the Rio Grande are bringing in drugs.
[00:15:55.021 --> 00:16:00.786]  We talked to law enforcement, they said those are 55 pound standard cartel bags, it's marijuana, it floats,
[00:16:02.315 --> 00:16:15.568]  The mules or the couriers then go back across and do it over and over and over again unless sometimes there are people that are illegal coming in and part of their passage across is that they've got to carry the bags.
[00:16:15.568 --> 00:16:16.869]  55 pound packs.
[00:16:16.869 --> 00:16:18.250]  It's compacted marijuana.
[00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.613]  It's classic name is Mexican Brown Weed.
[00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:25.576]  It's known because it's dead, it's brown, it's been compacted.
[00:16:25.576 --> 00:16:29.618]  It's the classic marijuana that's always flooded Texas my whole life.
[00:16:29.618 --> 00:16:31.320]  Maybe the worst headache you can imagine.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:37.264]  But the point is that is the, you know, kind of the Budweiser of marijuana.
[00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:40.126]  It's the cheap or the Milwaukee's best.
[00:16:40.126 --> 00:16:42.287]  And everybody knows it and that's what it is.
[00:16:42.287 --> 00:16:44.649]  And it's being brought across and it's being loaded on.
[00:16:47.284 --> 00:16:47.984]  Right in front of you.
[00:16:47.984 --> 00:16:51.525]  I mean, we've got it coming across the Rio Grande with a camera.
[00:16:51.525 --> 00:16:57.347]  Then we're waiting when they come through the woods, the same people, catch it on both sides, a perfect media sting.
[00:16:57.347 --> 00:16:58.967]  Where's our Peabody?
[00:16:58.967 --> 00:17:00.268]  Where's our Pulitzer?
[00:17:00.268 --> 00:17:03.048]  Where's our award for risking our lives?
[00:17:03.048 --> 00:17:04.569]  We don't get one.
[00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:13.111]  Megyn Kelly, who'd never get close to that, says that it's fake.
[00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:14.992]  Yeah, they were just carrying their dirty laundry across.
[00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:18.630]  I don't know, maybe some food.
[00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.951]  No, it's drugs.
[00:17:19.951 --> 00:17:22.973]  And you'd have to be a conspiracy theorist to say it wasn't.
[00:17:22.973 --> 00:17:26.516]  But getting back to Megyn Kelly, because it's bigger than her, it's about to fall.
[00:17:26.516 --> 00:17:31.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, I looked at her ratings with Putin, it was 7 million.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.423]  Dayline NBC had up to 15 million viewers when I've been on it two or three times before.
[00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:37.824]  And it was never even a big deal.
[00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:39.265]  I mean, I'm on big shows all the time.
[00:17:39.265 --> 00:17:39.946]  This was hype!
[00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:48.486]  She has the record lowest ratings ever recorded for Dateline NBC because people are sick of it and they don't want hit pieces.
[00:17:48.486 --> 00:17:57.896]  And it was a total hit piece where she just acted like she interviewed me, waited until I paused, waited until I wiggled my chair over almost two hours, and then cut it together like I was a sweating buffoon.
[00:17:57.896 --> 00:17:59.117]  Well, people all know the reality.
[00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:05.826]  They see this gibbering, stammering person when I'm the opposite of that.
[00:18:05.826 --> 00:18:07.487]  People know they just saw a fraud.
[00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:08.647]  But we've got it all.
[00:18:08.647 --> 00:18:10.187]  We've got the audio, we've got everything.
[00:18:10.187 --> 00:18:17.009]  But Mike Cernovich just pointed out to me, America's Funniest Home Videos has higher ratings and reruns than this.
[00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:21.210]  Mike Cernovich will be on with us in the studio coming up with Jesse James in just a little while.
[00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.771]  But break this down for us.
[00:18:24.485 --> 00:18:24.966]  Exactly.
[00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:25.947]  She was humiliated.
[00:18:25.947 --> 00:18:27.508]  We counter-programmed her.
[00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:29.050]  So, I don't know.
[00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:35.618]  Should you do her a favor and release the tapes is my question because the way I'm thinking is nobody cares about her.
[00:18:37.192 --> 00:18:38.494]  Nobody cares about her.
[00:18:38.494 --> 00:18:41.137]  Do we want to promote her brand anymore?
[00:18:41.137 --> 00:18:42.958]  Because she's going to be out of the game.
[00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.581]  So I would say don't even release the audio.
[00:18:45.581 --> 00:18:51.047]  What's the point of releasing the audio when she's a failure and needs us to promote her brand?
[00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.949]  We would be doing her a huge favor.
[00:18:52.949 --> 00:18:54.791]  So I don't think we should release the audio.
[00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:55.852]  And I want to be 100% clear here.
[00:18:58.018 --> 00:18:59.159]  In fact, let's pull that up.
[00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:01.580]  I'll give folks your source on that.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.162]  Record low ratings, what, 3 point something million.
[00:19:04.162 --> 00:19:07.104]  We'll show you the actual document here in a moment.
[00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:08.705]  This is joke level.
[00:19:08.705 --> 00:19:11.147]  We're not here saying we're on a power trip.
[00:19:11.147 --> 00:19:12.628]  We're not here saying we're big.
[00:19:12.628 --> 00:19:13.348]  We're powerful.
[00:19:13.348 --> 00:19:14.769]  It's not that we're that big.
[00:19:14.769 --> 00:19:15.890]  She's that little.
[00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.031]  There it is, Hollywood Reporter.
[00:19:17.751 --> 00:19:21.494]  The show offers up a flat 3.5 million viewers.
[00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:24.756]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is complete and total joke level.
[00:19:24.756 --> 00:19:32.001]  Sean Hannity every day has like 8 million viewers or listeners on his radio show, 3 to 5 million on his nightly show.
[00:19:33.642 --> 00:19:37.144]  This broadcast has over 3 million a day, conservatively.
[00:19:37.144 --> 00:19:40.186]  Rush Limbaugh has upwards of 10 million listeners a day.
[00:19:40.186 --> 00:19:45.069]  People like Coast to Coast AM's George Norrie has 6 to 8 million listeners a day.
[00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:58.076]  I mean, talk radio is the biggest thing out there, but TV believes it's so elite and so powerful, we're only pointing out that 3.5 for her show, when it was hyped like it was the end of the world, is unbelievable.
[00:19:58.076 --> 00:20:01.678]  They hyped this like the Super Bowl for over two weeks, and let's expand on this.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:11.986]  Mike Cernovich, on his Facebook, put out one video that was titled, let me go from memory here, Megan Kelly, the Queen of Fake News.
[00:20:11.986 --> 00:20:29.177]  I saw his internal analytics on his phone yesterday at my house, where it had 4.5 million views, and then another version had 2 million views on somebody else's channel, and our channel copied it and had a million views, and then all my other videos together were over 15 million views.
[00:20:29.637 --> 00:20:39.302]  Just a few of the videos we put together, so with his views, that's 22 plus million views in the last week on videos we put out online.
[00:20:39.302 --> 00:20:43.303]  We get 22 mil, she gets 3.5 mil.
[00:20:43.303 --> 00:20:48.206]  Now this again, this shows how it is literally a giant fraud, a giant hoax, a giant
[00:20:49.186 --> 00:20:51.188]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:51.188 --> 00:20:52.929]  TV's a dead medium.
[00:20:52.929 --> 00:20:56.752]  It was a fun thing to kind of do, but she tried to use you for the ratings.
[00:20:56.752 --> 00:20:57.713]  It didn't work.
[00:20:57.713 --> 00:20:59.455]  People aren't interested in what they have to say.
[00:20:59.455 --> 00:21:09.663]  I mean, I actually got a funny comment from somebody who's a more liberal person, a liberal media critic, and he had said to me, he said, they brought on Tom Brokaw, whereas you had on
[00:21:10.063 --> 00:21:13.424]  Me and Andrew Torba, the founder of a new social media company.
[00:21:13.424 --> 00:21:15.364]  We're the future, we're the truth.
[00:21:15.364 --> 00:21:16.945]  The best they can do is Megyn Kellett.
[00:21:16.945 --> 00:21:18.905]  I didn't know who Tom Brokaw was.
[00:21:18.905 --> 00:21:21.466]  And then when I saw him, I thought it was Dan Rather.
[00:21:21.466 --> 00:21:22.326]  Who cares?
[00:21:22.326 --> 00:21:24.046]  They think they're going to lecture us.
[00:21:24.046 --> 00:21:26.447]  And then meanwhile, you have me.
[00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:28.127]  I'm out there breaking big news.
[00:21:28.127 --> 00:21:31.328]  Andrew Torba's on there doing great things in social media.
[00:21:31.328 --> 00:21:32.108]  We're the future.
[00:21:32.108 --> 00:21:32.848]  They're the past.
[00:21:32.848 --> 00:21:33.908]  Everybody sees it now.
[00:21:33.908 --> 00:21:35.749]  Even the liberals who might disagree with us.
[00:21:36.309 --> 00:21:44.516]  Are saying, Cernovich, you know, I'm trying to tell my friends that if you guys don't up your game, you're going to be crushed, and they're winning the game.
[00:21:44.516 --> 00:21:45.677]  That's what they're saying about us.
[00:21:45.677 --> 00:21:50.101]  Everybody now who understands is saying that we are winning and destroying the media game.
[00:21:50.101 --> 00:22:03.012]  And the left, even with their big pharma advertisers, the poison that they sell people, all the diseases that they make up that don't even exist, even with all that money behind them and Soros behind them, we have them on the run for the first time.
[00:22:03.652 --> 00:22:04.433]  Since probably 1950.
[00:22:04.433 --> 00:22:06.617]  And I'll tell you what's crazy...
[00:22:08.649 --> 00:22:09.589]  I'm not being mean to old people.
[00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:11.130]  I love old people that are patriots.
[00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:18.633]  But when you look at all the hosts except for Kelly, they all look like they were 80 years old, and they were all trying to act like they were cool hipsters.
[00:22:18.633 --> 00:22:24.075]  You know, oh, legalize marijuana, or oh, let's go to New Zealand, or let's go do this or that.
[00:22:24.075 --> 00:22:32.839]  And then they roll out Tom Brokaw, who called me a total unalloyed racist earlier in the week.
[00:22:32.839 --> 00:22:34.940]  And then they come back
[00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.814]  And he's at the end of the show to say, we must stand against this evil racist.
[00:22:40.814 --> 00:22:43.215]  You know, we've got to do all this.
[00:22:43.215 --> 00:22:44.336]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:22:44.336 --> 00:22:49.760]  They literally opened up like the Crypt Keeper's mausoleum to bring out all their heavy hitters.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.743]  And I realize that's because all the execs are super old at NBC.
[00:22:53.743 --> 00:22:55.184]  That's because the shareholders are.
[00:22:55.184 --> 00:22:58.887]  I see the parties they have with Megyn Kelly on the runway.
[00:22:58.887 --> 00:23:00.669]  And it's a bunch of 75, 85, 90 year old people with their trophy wife,
[00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:27.688]  45 year old women and it's all these old men like Hugh Hefner's in these photos you can Google their names Dan Rather Megyn Kelly and see them on the runway together and like all these little old men that are shorter than her and that's no big deal you get smaller as you get older you know my dad's like a foot shorter than he used to be and I mean I'm a few inches shorter than I used to be you know you slunch over your you know your discs start collapsing whatever but there's like all these little gremlin men like
[00:23:27.688 --> 00:23:33.333]  Like, hanging on her like she's their mommy, and they hope Medusa can roll out and defeat us.
[00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:39.738]  And then they have 3.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen and Hollywood Reporter.
[00:23:39.738 --> 00:23:42.700]  This is the biggest joke I've ever seen.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:48.565]  Ladies and gentlemen, my Sunday show is only half the size of my weekday broadcast, but I'd like to get ahead of the news.
[00:23:49.165 --> 00:23:50.786]  It's got over 100 affiliates.
[00:23:50.786 --> 00:24:01.331]  Conservatively, according to the ad agencies that get the big spectrum of ratings that come in, it has close to 2 million listeners on average that tune in.
[00:24:01.331 --> 00:24:04.753]  Sometimes if there's an NFL game or something, it's like, you know, not even a million.
[00:24:04.753 --> 00:24:08.494]  But that's on commercial radio rated almost 2 million.
[00:24:08.494 --> 00:24:10.936]  The weekday show, almost 4 million over the 3-4 hours.
[00:24:11.676 --> 00:24:12.537]  But that's rated!
[00:24:12.537 --> 00:24:15.559]  And then of course there's internet and live streams and everything else.
[00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:16.200]  It's huge.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:21.284]  We're talking conservatively, 45 million different people that tune in each week, one way or the other.
[00:24:22.323 --> 00:24:26.807]  If that's 45 million people, it's not 6 million like Tom Brokaw.
[00:24:26.807 --> 00:24:31.291]  But notice, Tom Brokaw on every other channel this week kept saying 6 million, 6 million, 6 million.
[00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:33.833]  There was no original article that even said that.
[00:24:33.833 --> 00:24:38.317]  Some talking point went out and said the 6 million, and I think it came from Podesta.
[00:24:38.317 --> 00:24:47.805]  Because the entire attack we're seeing, from Pizzagate to Newtown to everything, is the exact hit pieces they put out a year ago in the Hillary campaign against myself and Trump.
[00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:49.326]  It's word for word.
[00:24:49.326 --> 00:24:49.827]  What do you think?
[00:24:50.632 --> 00:24:57.438]  Yeah, it's old news and it's boring, and all credit of course to you and the people who suck the air dry.
[00:24:57.438 --> 00:25:04.545]  So what happened is, because we counter-programmed so aggressively, everybody had already thought they watched the interview.
[00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:06.466]  Nobody cared to watch Megyn Kelly.
[00:25:06.466 --> 00:25:07.868]  If you actually read the articles,
[00:25:08.408 --> 00:25:13.692]  All the articles talked about how we were drinking champagne and having fun and toasting to victory and everything.
[00:25:13.692 --> 00:25:15.813]  Nobody even cared about what Megyn Kelly said.
[00:25:15.813 --> 00:25:18.195]  It goes to show she's not interesting.
[00:25:18.195 --> 00:25:19.175]  She doesn't read books.
[00:25:19.175 --> 00:25:22.818]  I've said, ask Megyn Kelly what is the last book she has read.
[00:25:22.818 --> 00:25:24.079]  She clearly is not literate.
[00:25:24.079 --> 00:25:25.400]  She's not cultured.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.861]  She didn't read a book about Russia before she went to Putin.
[00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:34.005]  I'd actually heard from my sources in the media that she had made some very, um, she mistook St.
[00:25:34.005 --> 00:25:34.546]  Petersburg
[00:25:35.326 --> 00:25:37.527]  Uh, landmarks for things that were in Moscow.
[00:25:37.527 --> 00:25:40.889]  She completely humiliated herself.
[00:25:40.889 --> 00:25:44.631]  She got really excited when she talked about Putin to me.
[00:25:44.631 --> 00:25:47.192]  And, and, again, she doesn't get this.
[00:25:47.192 --> 00:26:03.241]  Even a toad like me, with a heat lamp over my head, who'd been working since, you know, seven in the morning, interviewing me at ten at night, and despite all the editing and almost two hours that she had just from that interview, all she could put out was the five or six stammers, the five or six times that I wiped my brow,
[00:26:03.581 --> 00:26:09.105]  Yeah, I was embarrassed by the whole thing and it goes to show we should not waste our time talking to these people.
[00:26:09.105 --> 00:26:10.646]  They don't bring anything to the table.
[00:26:10.646 --> 00:26:12.327]  NBC doesn't bring anything to the table.
[00:26:12.327 --> 00:26:13.068]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:26:33.197 --> 00:26:37.759]  Her show didn't overall, but the giant spectacle and the trolling them did.
[00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:45.001]  Because I realized when I bought that bottle of champagne at the grocery store yesterday with you, before we came into the office, we were hanging out at my house.
[00:26:45.001 --> 00:26:49.663]  I knew that regardless, just popping the champagne bottle and declaring victory would be victory.
[00:26:49.943 --> 00:26:51.024]  Because they don't get it.
[00:26:51.024 --> 00:26:53.306]  Mainstream media is already hated and reviled.
[00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:54.927]  They're already seen as the enemy.
[00:26:54.927 --> 00:27:01.892]  So all we have to do is signify and identify with the public that hates them and celebrate their cultural powers.
[00:27:01.892 --> 00:27:05.415]  Death, that was the big win, was simply the act of pissing on them.
[00:27:05.635 --> 00:27:11.842]  Well, and that's what I've been trying to tell all these weak beta males in the GOP who we have to rout in 2018.
[00:27:11.842 --> 00:27:14.185]  The hit piece only lands if you flinch.
[00:27:14.185 --> 00:27:19.170]  When you laugh in their face and you mock them and you toast champagne, it doesn't even matter what's showing.
[00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.572]  Exactly, if they throw a punch!
[00:27:20.652 --> 00:27:29.276]  Alex, listen, that time Glenn Danzig, who's a great musician and everything else, got in a fight with a guy a lot bigger than him and took it on the chin and got knocked out.
[00:27:29.276 --> 00:27:30.637]  That really hurt him.
[00:27:30.637 --> 00:27:33.938]  But if it wouldn't have knocked him out, it would have made him even stronger.
[00:27:33.938 --> 00:27:38.040]  Or if he'd have got back up and uppercutted the guy, then he'd be champion of the world.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.101]  And I'm not trying to knock Glenn Danzig.
[00:27:40.101 --> 00:27:42.722]  The point is, his bodyguards jumped in and wouldn't let him keep fighting.
[00:27:42.722 --> 00:27:43.983]  Maybe he would have won.
[00:27:43.983 --> 00:27:46.004]  The point is, is that if you take it on the chin,
[00:27:46.804 --> 00:27:50.026]  And then, it even knocks you down, but you get back up, you're Superman!
[00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:51.327]  And that's why I went into it.
[00:27:51.327 --> 00:27:59.732]  Even a sweating blob up there with them lying, and those snakes attacking me from every side, even though I'm not that strong, I'm not that good.
[00:27:59.732 --> 00:28:03.475]  My heart's good, I want freedom, and I knew we would defeat them.
[00:28:03.475 --> 00:28:09.138]  And across the board, they admit, we destroyed them, and she had to lie on tape and promise it wasn't a hit piece.
[00:28:09.138 --> 00:28:11.880]  She's now known as a total liar, a total fraud.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.122]  This is a devastating defeat for them.
[00:28:14.864 --> 00:28:20.146]  Yeah, nobody interesting is going to talk to her now because we all heard her commit journalistic fraud.
[00:28:20.146 --> 00:28:22.106]  She is now a journalistic fraud.
[00:28:22.106 --> 00:28:25.007]  People who are interesting like me, why would I ever talk to her now?
[00:28:25.007 --> 00:28:27.308]  Especially for a few paltry viewers.
[00:28:27.308 --> 00:28:29.488]  I'll do more on that, spending my time on Facebook.
[00:28:29.488 --> 00:28:32.889]  And that's something the fake news people, media people have to understand.
[00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:38.691]  They get real angry because I blow them off and I go, look dude, I can do a video or write a blog post.
[00:28:38.691 --> 00:28:39.972]  More people are going to read it.
[00:28:39.972 --> 00:28:40.892]  They're going to read your article.
[00:28:41.332 --> 00:28:42.533]  So don't waste my time.
[00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:59.700]  So the only media people I'll talk to now, they have to be literate and have read books, and that means it's only like 5% of journalism, because the other people, they ask you the same questions over and over again, the same boring thing, Sandy Hook, Pizzagate, this or that, and the public is burned out, you have to stay fresh.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:06.783]  So at the optics of it, I mean, if you wanted to talk about a meme, you could compare you, me, Andrew Torba,
[00:29:07.523 --> 00:29:08.444]  On one side.
[00:29:08.444 --> 00:29:14.532]  On the other side, Dan Rather, or Tom Rather, or whatever the guy's name is.
[00:29:14.532 --> 00:29:16.414]  And Megyn Kelly on the other side.
[00:29:16.414 --> 00:29:19.839]  And then go show that to the people and say, what is the future and what is the past?
[00:29:21.255 --> 00:29:33.941]  Exactly, or just show shots of younger people that are on YouTube, even than us, and like show their stats, they're like 20 times bigger, and then say, now look at these people, rolling out a retiree like Tom Brokaw?
[00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:36.683]  But again, if Tom Brokaw was promoting freedom,
[00:29:37.723 --> 00:29:39.905]  He would have giant audiences, no matter how old he was.
[00:29:39.905 --> 00:29:41.486]  So it's not bashing old people.
[00:29:41.486 --> 00:29:47.430]  It just shows, though, it is a bunch of old, out-of-touch people that still think globalism's gonna win when we've kicked their butt.
[00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.371]  Thanks, Mike Cernovich.
[00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:50.392]  More coming up on the Russia crisis.
[00:29:50.392 --> 00:29:51.773]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.773 --> 00:29:54.315]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.315 --> 00:29:56.997]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.294 --> 00:30:03.816]  Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine.
[00:30:03.816 --> 00:30:12.883]  On Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage of the New York Public Disgrace Theater showing of Caesar, which should really be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination of President Trump.
[00:30:12.883 --> 00:30:22.150]  She rushed the stage, insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands, as well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.593]  While she was being arrested, Jack Posobiec went live on Twitter to broadcast the event.
[00:30:26.673 --> 00:30:34.117]  And then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience that Joseph Goebbels would be proud of this production and that they were Nazis.
[00:30:34.117 --> 00:30:40.581]  While the left is having side effects of outrage to their own medicine, even allies in the Trump movement have been at odds over the protest.
[00:30:40.581 --> 00:30:47.385]  Regardless, the very next night, more protesters took the stage, shouting Goebbels would be proud, CNN is ISIS.
[00:30:47.385 --> 00:30:49.006]  While the protesters were all arrested,
[00:30:49.326 --> 00:30:57.954]  Rumor has it some of the police involved support the protest against the expression of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York Public Theater against our president.
[00:30:57.954 --> 00:31:01.037]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:31:01.037 --> 00:31:02.939]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:02.939 --> 00:31:04.961]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:07.863]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:07.863 --> 00:31:10.426]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[00:31:10.606 --> 00:31:13.908]  The elite is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:13.908 --> 00:31:23.093]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:23.093 --> 00:31:28.196]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:31:28.196 --> 00:31:30.638]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:38.662]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:38.662 --> 00:31:39.623]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:40.849 --> 00:31:44.211]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:44.211 --> 00:31:48.354]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:48.354 --> 00:31:55.059]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:55.059 --> 00:31:59.162]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[00:32:01.783 --> 00:32:03.205]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:32:03.205 --> 00:32:04.566]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:32:04.566 --> 00:32:05.767]  Why is this so good?
[00:32:05.767 --> 00:32:11.051]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:24.602]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:32:24.602 --> 00:32:25.964]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:32:26.744 --> 00:32:28.385]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:32:28.385 --> 00:32:30.947]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:32:30.947 --> 00:32:32.268]  These are all parasites.
[00:32:32.268 --> 00:32:33.369]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:32:33.369 --> 00:32:34.690]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:39.213]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:32:39.213 --> 00:32:42.375]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:32:42.475 --> 00:32:45.516]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:32:45.516 --> 00:32:46.576]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:32:46.576 --> 00:32:48.517]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:48.517 --> 00:32:49.537]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:32:49.537 --> 00:32:52.238]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:32:52.238 --> 00:32:55.499]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:55.499 --> 00:32:57.759]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:32:57.759 --> 00:32:59.700]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:33:15.223 --> 00:33:19.153]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:56.633 --> 00:34:01.638]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Mike Cernovich is in studio with us.
[00:34:01.638 --> 00:34:03.480]  He was in the control room, but I thought I'd just bring him in here.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.583]  We've got a bunch of other guests coming on throughout the day.
[00:34:06.583 --> 00:34:12.949]  We've had one British man reportedly run over a Muslim and kill him in the street and hit a few other people.
[00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.146]  They're calling it a terror attack.
[00:34:15.146 --> 00:34:17.327]  The left is calling for total retribution.
[00:34:17.327 --> 00:34:20.589]  They're saying all whites are to blame and all Christians are to blame.
[00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:21.770]  They're not calling for unity.
[00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.111]  They're not calling for love.
[00:34:23.111 --> 00:34:26.813]  They're not calling for hashtag, you know, sweetie pie.
[00:34:26.813 --> 00:34:28.374]  They're calling for death.
[00:34:28.374 --> 00:34:33.498]  We don't even know the truth about this or what the guy's political motives were yet.
[00:34:33.498 --> 00:34:39.602]  And they said that the man was already in the street and appeared to be sick with people gathered around him when he got run over.
[00:34:40.404 --> 00:34:45.607]  Now we've seen staged events where they stage dead kids and stuff on the side of the Mediterranean.
[00:34:45.607 --> 00:34:48.829]  We know Islamists will still blow themselves up for their political aims.
[00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:50.670]  So could this be staged?
[00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:51.950]  I'm not saying that.
[00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:57.874]  I'm saying our government staged the babies in the incubators event that led to millions of dead in multiple wars.
[00:34:57.874 --> 00:34:59.695]  I'm saying Muslims are caught staging
[00:35:00.555 --> 00:35:01.415]  Stuff all the time.
[00:35:01.415 --> 00:35:06.157]  Trump said, you know, he thought the Jewish Center's getting attacked and the cemeteries was probably a false flag.
[00:35:06.157 --> 00:35:11.159]  And it turned out a month later, the police busted a young leftist Jewish man that was doing it to blame Trump.
[00:35:11.159 --> 00:35:15.200]  And a journalist, actually, Juan M. Thompson, who, I mean, this is amazing.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:28.465]  And again, that's why the fake news media is having a crisis of legitimacy, is Juan M. Thompson, who formerly worked at The Intercept, had written articles about how Trump, people at Trump rallies were calling him the N-bomb and dropping N-bombs and everything like that.
[00:35:29.365 --> 00:35:41.691]  But then it turns out he was the person who was actually calling in death threats to Jewish community centers, and he was actually trying to frame a white woman that he had dated or been involved with for this crime.
[00:35:41.691 --> 00:35:50.496]  So we literally have so-called journalists, right, calling in bomb threats, trying to frame other people, and then they go, wait a minute, why does nobody trust us?
[00:35:50.496 --> 00:35:51.396]  Why do people think we're death threats?
[00:35:51.396 --> 00:35:54.098]  And by the way, he was a journalist, a leftist, all this stuff.
[00:35:55.174 --> 00:35:56.395]  Threats on the ADL.
[00:35:56.395 --> 00:36:00.959]  I'm not saying the ADL did this, but they've been caught breaking into police stations to get files.
[00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:05.403]  They've been caught and they've lost lawsuits framing people, calling them anti-semitic.
[00:36:05.403 --> 00:36:08.485]  They were founded, the ADL was founded by the Jewish Mafia.
[00:36:08.485 --> 00:36:10.867]  Now I don't believe Jews run the world, I'm not anti-semitic.
[00:36:10.867 --> 00:36:19.355]  The ADL itself though is a leftist organization that has been caught and been absolutely convicted in civil court.
[00:36:19.875 --> 00:36:30.139]  A lot of my Jewish friends actually hate the ADL and will talk about these issues all the time because they know that there's a lot of people trying to divide people along racial lines, ethnic lines.
[00:36:38.723 --> 00:36:46.127]  Now, one thing you'll notice is Alex began receiving death threats last night from Megyn Kelly, and that, I believe, was a target.
[00:36:46.127 --> 00:36:48.128]  She was trying to put a target on Alex.
[00:36:48.128 --> 00:36:53.191]  And unlike Alex and I, we have pledged to disavow all political violence.
[00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:54.612]  So if this thing that happened
[00:36:55.152 --> 00:36:56.873]  With the guy in the van running over the mosque.
[00:36:56.873 --> 00:36:59.194]  I had people going, oh, I bet you won't comment about this.
[00:36:59.194 --> 00:37:04.937]  And I go, you're such a sociopath that you think that I would ever, ever have the back.
[00:37:04.937 --> 00:37:07.778]  No, I think if he did this just because they were Muslims, it's wrong.
[00:37:07.778 --> 00:37:08.998]  It's terrorism.
[00:37:08.998 --> 00:37:09.999]  And it's only going to escalate this.
[00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:15.721]  I totally agree that this is the time to intensify our calls to never offensively launch violence.
[00:37:15.721 --> 00:37:16.682]  I agree with Ted Nugent.
[00:37:16.682 --> 00:37:18.423]  We need to get back on the broadcast.
[00:37:18.423 --> 00:37:18.903]  Uncle Ted.
[00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:19.683]  I think so.
[00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:40.922]  Are wanting to have peace, are wanting to have the high road.
[00:37:40.922 --> 00:37:49.126]  They take our kindness for weakness and it seems like our calls for peace though are only getting them into a more violent froth everywhere.
[00:37:49.126 --> 00:37:53.047]  Well they better hope, well they found out that we'll protest, okay?
[00:37:53.047 --> 00:37:58.749]  So they found out that if you want to have a little play where you assassinate Trump, the new right does protest.
[00:37:58.749 --> 00:38:00.390]  So my advice to them would be to ratchet down.
[00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.951]  But the bigger issue here is why will Jake Taper
[00:38:03.631 --> 00:38:11.240]  And Megyn Kelly and Brian Stelter and CNN, why will not they join our pledge to disavow political violence of all types?
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:11.861]  They won't!
[00:38:11.861 --> 00:38:12.282]  That's right!
[00:38:12.282 --> 00:38:17.828]  Wolf Blitzer had on the guest that said the guy that, you know, shot the congressman and the cops and everything last week.
[00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:19.570]  And Congressman Scalise, still fighting for his life.
[00:38:20.151 --> 00:38:24.637]  And all these surgeries later, he has the guest on saying this man wasn't evil, he was just tired of politics.
[00:38:24.637 --> 00:38:25.978]  And everybody nods their head on the show.
[00:38:25.978 --> 00:38:27.260]  It's like, absolutely.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:32.586]  I mean, we need to hear from Wolf Blitzer that he disavows people saying this was, quote, just political.
[00:38:32.586 --> 00:38:35.730]  Because God forbid somebody didn't find Wolf Blitzer next time.
[00:38:36.531 --> 00:38:43.076]  Or another CNN host, the next time they're doing a live remote, just walks up and pumps rounds into them, saying it's just politics.
[00:38:43.076 --> 00:38:43.897]  That would be horrible.
[00:38:43.897 --> 00:38:44.958]  Well, that's the whole point.
[00:38:44.958 --> 00:38:49.041]  That's what I keep telling them as I go, look, you guys got to understand something here.
[00:38:49.041 --> 00:38:51.063]  I am trying to keep you safe.
[00:38:51.063 --> 00:38:57.708]  And if you say, hey, it's open season on Trump supporters, it's open season on Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich, the independent media.
[00:38:57.708 --> 00:38:59.990]  If you're inciting your listeners and viewers to murder us,
[00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:05.832]  I can assure you if any harm befalls either of us, you have no idea what will be unleashed.
[00:39:05.832 --> 00:39:07.733]  So you need the peace.
[00:39:07.733 --> 00:39:08.334]  I don't need it.
[00:39:08.334 --> 00:39:09.134]  I'm not afraid.
[00:39:09.134 --> 00:39:11.975]  If things go hot, hey, I'm not afraid of anything.
[00:39:11.975 --> 00:39:14.096]  Neither are people on my team, alright?
[00:39:14.096 --> 00:39:17.638]  We, though, we have daughters, we like art, we like culture.
[00:39:17.638 --> 00:39:20.359]  There's nothing good about civil war, so you gotta understand that.
[00:39:20.359 --> 00:39:25.121]  Another point, too, is that we do have security, and we've got, in each major room, weapons lockers.
[00:39:25.521 --> 00:39:26.201]  Exactly, yeah.
[00:39:26.201 --> 00:39:29.583]  So they have, and I, when I travel even, they go, oh, you know, are you by yourself?
[00:39:29.583 --> 00:39:34.344]  And I go, if you think I'm by myself, I'm not obviously not going to blow OPSEC or talk about what I carry or whatever.
[00:39:34.344 --> 00:39:43.068]  But the bigger point is CNN also hosted Thomas DeMossimo, who jumped the stage in the Ohio Trump rally, attempted to assassinate Trump.
[00:39:43.068 --> 00:39:48.269]  He had tweeted out gun emojis about Trump and said that he wanted to be a martyr.
[00:39:48.269 --> 00:39:49.350]  CNN put him on.
[00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.791]  And they called him a protester.
[00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:55.373]  That kid in Vegas, I call him a kid, he's actually a terrorist.
[00:39:55.373 --> 00:39:57.414]  The BBC did a profile on him.
[00:39:57.414 --> 00:40:01.276]  He tried to grab a gun from Secret Service and he was going to go try to murder Trump.
[00:40:01.276 --> 00:40:03.117]  They treat these guys like heroes.
[00:40:03.117 --> 00:40:10.040]  And then they come at us and try to pin things on us when they're the ones who are saying, we will give you an audience, we will give you a platform.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.741]  But let's be clear, let's be clear.
[00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:13.642]  I want to get into the Russia issues and a few other here in a moment.
[00:40:14.062 --> 00:40:23.206]  We got a bunch of guests coming up today, but Mike Cernovich in studio with us, visiting us here in Austin as we gear up to launch more shows and a larger network system on radio and TV.
[00:40:23.206 --> 00:40:27.628]  I want to just pull back just briefly on Megyn Kelly, because you've got a lot of prominent folks texting you.
[00:40:27.628 --> 00:40:31.190]  I've got them texting me saying, yes, we're sick of Megyn Kelly.
[00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:32.390]  She's been defeated.
[00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:36.592]  She had 3.5 million viewers when Dateline NBC used to have 15 million.
[00:40:36.592 --> 00:40:39.133]  When she first took over the show, it had 6, 7 million.
[00:40:39.133 --> 00:40:40.934]  People don't want to see their hit pieces.
[00:40:41.334 --> 00:40:42.675]  They're sick of the hype.
[00:40:42.675 --> 00:40:45.577]  When the mainstream media hype something, everybody tunes out of it.
[00:40:45.577 --> 00:40:55.926]  Meanwhile, again, we're not bragging, I had over 15 million views just on Facebook and YouTube last week, just on our handful of Megyn Kelly videos.
[00:40:55.926 --> 00:40:58.007]  The average video had about a million views.
[00:40:58.007 --> 00:40:58.728]  I mean, that's crazy.
[00:40:58.728 --> 00:41:00.129]  We had one that had four million views.
[00:41:00.129 --> 00:41:02.051]  You had a couple with over four million views.
[00:41:02.051 --> 00:41:03.312]  Paul Watson.
[00:41:03.312 --> 00:41:04.332]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:41:04.332 --> 00:41:06.894]  It's an absolute joke.
[00:41:06.894 --> 00:41:09.056]  Plus, I'm airing those videos here on air.
[00:41:10.373 --> 00:41:13.134]  With an audience of conservatively.
[00:41:13.134 --> 00:41:13.994]  So conservative.
[00:41:13.994 --> 00:41:21.017]  That's, you know, people that are rated, listening on commercial radio, and we can see on the streams, listening, four plus million a day.
[00:41:21.017 --> 00:41:25.799]  It's a joke, and our overhead is probably one-tenth of what Megyn Kelly's is.
[00:41:25.799 --> 00:41:30.020]  It still costs millions of dollars to run something like this, and thanks to your support, we're able to do it.
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.161]  But this is just biblical.
[00:41:32.161 --> 00:41:32.761]  What a joke.
[00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:37.203]  I can't believe that her ratings have gone seven million.
[00:41:37.583 --> 00:41:38.704]  Five million.
[00:41:38.704 --> 00:41:39.405]  Three million.
[00:41:39.405 --> 00:41:45.612]  I mean, she is falling like a shooting star from her old highs of five million at Fox.
[00:41:45.612 --> 00:41:46.733]  Then she attacks Trump.
[00:41:46.733 --> 00:41:48.414]  It drops to two million.
[00:41:48.414 --> 00:41:49.756]  Then they get rid of her.
[00:41:49.756 --> 00:41:52.419]  Now they're talking about you have your sources getting rid of her contract.
[00:41:52.839 --> 00:41:57.505]  Yeah, so that's the whole thing is, at this point, we're actually doing her a favor.
[00:41:57.505 --> 00:41:59.547]  She isn't in our league anymore.
[00:41:59.547 --> 00:42:00.629]  Maybe she was at one time.
[00:42:00.629 --> 00:42:03.332]  Megyn Kelly, Tom Brokaw, they're just not in our league.
[00:42:03.332 --> 00:42:05.534]  They can't compete with us at all.
[00:42:05.534 --> 00:42:10.741]  So yeah, I'm getting text messages from all kinds of high-level people, from the government, media, you name it.
[00:42:11.321 --> 00:42:26.265]  Even people from Hollywood saying yeah, you know at this point You know even one person who's a publicist for all the Hollywood people said at this point She is so dead and desperate that you're doing her a favor by talking about her you guys are way bigger than she is They want us to move on now.
[00:42:26.265 --> 00:42:28.226]  That's why I was telling Alex earlier.
[00:42:28.226 --> 00:42:30.587]  You know I said Oh, why even release the audio now?
[00:42:30.587 --> 00:42:31.887]  She she's dead.
[00:42:31.887 --> 00:42:33.227]  We did the autopsy.
[00:42:33.227 --> 00:42:33.908]  We've inspected well.
[00:42:33.908 --> 00:42:34.268]  We said
[00:42:35.428 --> 00:42:41.273]  We said we were going to do it, but I'm going to do this very, very delicately, as the Wicked Witch of the West says of the East.
[00:42:41.273 --> 00:42:47.198]  We're just going to go through and show the lies of the piece, then we're going to show where she edited stuff, how she manipulated it, what I actually said.
[00:42:47.198 --> 00:42:53.203]  It's just, it's like making a documentary, but I'm going to put a deadline on a Friday to try to just put it out.
[00:42:53.903 --> 00:42:57.266]  It's not fun, though, listening to hours and hours of her or myself.
[00:42:57.266 --> 00:42:58.567]  I mean, she's boring, dude.
[00:42:58.567 --> 00:43:04.112]  No, that's the whole point is nobody wants to watch vapid Megyn Kelly, boring Megyn Kelly.
[00:43:04.112 --> 00:43:05.453]  Nobody wants to listen to her.
[00:43:05.453 --> 00:43:09.456]  They would rather watch you on Joe Rogan with the Joe Rogan podcast.
[00:43:09.456 --> 00:43:11.418]  That is the most downloaded podcast of all time.
[00:43:11.418 --> 00:43:12.539]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:19.304]  So if you're in a room and there was something like the analytics were through the roof and they got bigger as you talk longer.
[00:43:19.304 --> 00:43:22.227]  So you guys were going for four hours and then Joe was like, hey, we got to stop.
[00:43:22.227 --> 00:43:22.567]  And I was like,
[00:43:22.927 --> 00:43:25.489]  I don't know, maybe Joe was like a little bit jealous or something?
[00:43:25.489 --> 00:43:28.032]  No, he had to go do a... No.
[00:43:28.032 --> 00:43:29.013]  Joe's huge.
[00:43:29.013 --> 00:43:31.935]  Probably bigger than I am overall for his total reach.
[00:43:31.935 --> 00:43:33.276]  And he's definitely smarter.
[00:43:33.276 --> 00:43:34.117]  He knows everything I know.
[00:43:34.117 --> 00:43:36.599]  He just, you know, kind of runs down the rail there.
[00:43:36.599 --> 00:43:37.080]  Talk about it.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:37.981]  But believe me, he knows what he's doing.
[00:43:37.981 --> 00:43:39.382]  No, he had to go do a sold-out show.
[00:43:39.382 --> 00:43:39.962]  Gotcha.
[00:43:39.962 --> 00:43:43.025]  So you... No, what he is is a super workhorse.
[00:43:43.025 --> 00:43:43.506]  Gotcha.
[00:43:43.506 --> 00:43:44.246]  Well, you have to be.
[00:43:44.246 --> 00:43:46.909]  So the point, though, is the longer you guys talked,
[00:43:47.469 --> 00:43:56.300]  Despite when I started watching you guys were doing 10,000 live viewers and then it just kept going crazy You guys would have had probably you probably would have crashed YouTube.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.302]  But so the point is for those you listening us
[00:43:59.545 --> 00:44:01.266]  Alex Jones can talk for four hours.
[00:44:01.266 --> 00:44:03.388]  The longer he talks, the more people listen.
[00:44:03.388 --> 00:44:05.889]  Megyn Kelly is the opposite effect.
[00:44:05.889 --> 00:44:09.592]  You hear her talk for 30 seconds, you're like, oh god, another.
[00:44:09.592 --> 00:44:11.913]  It's like pretending you're interested in a girl when you're dating.
[00:44:11.913 --> 00:44:13.294]  You're like, oh god, she's so true.
[00:44:13.294 --> 00:44:15.536]  But I'm going to walk that thing back about Joe.
[00:44:15.536 --> 00:44:18.238]  Joe is one of the most unjealous people I know of anybody.
[00:44:18.238 --> 00:44:19.538]  He's super confident.
[00:44:19.538 --> 00:44:22.741]  And I'm going to say, you know, a masculine man on the classical side.
[00:44:22.741 --> 00:44:23.301]  He's smart.
[00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:23.741]  He's tough.
[00:44:23.741 --> 00:44:24.522]  He's funny.
[00:44:24.522 --> 00:44:26.403]  The truth was, he's got family like I do.
[00:44:26.403 --> 00:44:27.464]  He had family stuff that day.
[00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:31.147]  He got there a little bit late like we did.
[00:44:31.147 --> 00:44:32.908]  He's like, dude, great to see you.
[00:44:32.908 --> 00:44:34.590]  Man, it was like smog that day.
[00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.051]  I felt sick.
[00:44:36.051 --> 00:44:37.932]  He goes, let's just do like an hour, all right?
[00:44:37.932 --> 00:44:40.394]  And then we start drinking a little bit of whiskey.
[00:44:40.394 --> 00:44:43.297]  He's not a big drinker, but for energy, we start drinking a little bit of whiskey.
[00:44:43.297 --> 00:44:45.238]  He goes, yeah, man, I got a sold out show tonight.
[00:44:45.238 --> 00:44:45.859]  It'll be great.
[00:44:45.859 --> 00:44:47.000]  You want to go?
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.321]  Because maybe we get some dinner after.
[00:44:48.321 --> 00:44:51.323]  If not, I can't have dinner after this with you and Eddie if you're going to that steakhouse.
[00:44:51.323 --> 00:44:52.144]  I'm like, no, let's just get it.
[00:44:52.144 --> 00:44:53.605]  He goes, all right, let's do an hour, hour and a half.
[00:44:54.426 --> 00:44:56.888]  You know, Eddie's here, come on, let's go on in here.
[00:44:56.888 --> 00:45:03.213]  And then we did it, and then he got woke up, and then he went four hours, and then he's like, God, I'm exhausted.
[00:45:03.213 --> 00:45:05.134]  And then he went and did a two-hour show.
[00:45:05.134 --> 00:45:07.656]  So that's what really happened behind the scenes.
[00:45:07.656 --> 00:45:12.520]  Yeah, because everybody was asking me, they go, dude, the ratings kept getting higher and higher and higher and higher and higher.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.841]  It was like Super Bowl-level ratings.
[00:45:14.241 --> 00:45:14.741]  So it's good.
[00:45:14.741 --> 00:45:15.462]  It's good that we covered that.
[00:45:15.462 --> 00:45:21.165]  That's the whole point of doing real journalism is to give people behind the scenes and people can't get enough of that.
[00:45:21.165 --> 00:45:24.806]  But with Megyn Kelly, nobody wants to hear the audio, man.
[00:45:24.806 --> 00:45:25.347]  I'm telling you.
[00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:27.888]  I mean, if you want to release it, you know, you're the boss.
[00:45:27.888 --> 00:45:28.728]  You can do what you want to do.
[00:45:28.728 --> 00:45:30.289]  But I think people are so bored.
[00:45:30.289 --> 00:45:31.770]  I just don't want to listen to the torture.
[00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.770]  No, I couldn't do that.
[00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:36.112]  Frankly, I get a little annoying, too, because it was just the most dumb.
[00:45:36.112 --> 00:45:39.394]  It was 30 minutes on each subject just trying to get me to because.
[00:45:40.234 --> 00:45:40.535]  I don't
[00:45:57.972 --> 00:46:00.834]  It would be torture to assign that to anybody to do.
[00:46:00.834 --> 00:46:03.816]  Because I couldn't, if you said, hey Senator Mitch, you want to help me with this?
[00:46:03.816 --> 00:46:07.618]  I would be like, you know, I love you Alex, but dude, I can't handle this man.
[00:46:07.618 --> 00:46:08.639]  I cannot handle.
[00:46:08.639 --> 00:46:09.720]  I barely could watch her.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:15.003]  I had to drink wine to even watch her for a few minutes cut into pieces.
[00:46:15.003 --> 00:46:17.505]  Because that's how... We're not just saying that.
[00:46:17.505 --> 00:46:18.686]  No, it's true.
[00:46:18.686 --> 00:46:20.387]  I mean, no, it's true.
[00:46:20.387 --> 00:46:21.047]  I don't watch her.
[00:46:21.047 --> 00:46:22.128]  I don't watch Megyn Kelly.
[00:46:22.128 --> 00:46:24.870]  The people who listen to us and watch us don't watch Megyn Kelly.
[00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.411]  Even the liberals who are on her side.
[00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:28.813]  They're telling me, God, that was terrible, dude.
[00:46:28.813 --> 00:46:29.974]  You know, I'll never watch her again.
[00:46:29.974 --> 00:46:31.195]  She's so boring.
[00:46:31.195 --> 00:46:31.615]  She has nothing.
[00:46:31.615 --> 00:46:32.676]  Let's think about Joe Rogan, though.
[00:46:32.676 --> 00:46:33.997]  He's like a real family guy.
[00:46:33.997 --> 00:46:38.201]  Like, I think he said he's been at a children's birthday party before and then shopping and traffic.
[00:46:38.201 --> 00:46:41.124]  And you're like, you're like in this office and, you know, L.A.
[00:46:41.124 --> 00:46:42.805]  I mean, this is the real world, folks.
[00:46:42.805 --> 00:46:44.087]  This isn't teleprompters.
[00:46:44.087 --> 00:46:45.268]  This isn't pre-screen.
[00:46:45.268 --> 00:46:46.449]  We're just dads.
[00:46:46.449 --> 00:46:47.610]  We're just people here fighting.
[00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:51.032]  Well, I mean, your fame and Joe Rogan's fame, I don't want anything to do with that.
[00:46:51.032 --> 00:46:52.793]  So we're in Austin, actually.
[00:46:52.793 --> 00:46:53.673]  I wouldn't even say it's fame.
[00:46:53.673 --> 00:46:55.534]  It's more like we have just connected with people.
[00:46:55.534 --> 00:47:05.160]  Well, but the point is, though, for those people who have never hung out with you, we were in Austin and everywhere we go, people are looking, talking, sending people out to talk to him, tracking it.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.162]  So, you know, just from my own standpoint, like Alex Jones is a level of fame.
[00:47:09.162 --> 00:47:10.903]  Well, I can't imagine Joe Rogan fame.
[00:47:10.903 --> 00:47:11.944]  That would not be funny.
[00:47:11.944 --> 00:47:13.645]  Here's the only reason to have that message.
[00:47:15.356 --> 00:47:30.385]  For all the conservatives that want to kiss the mainstream media's butt and the congressmen that get upset when CNN or NBC says something, it's only because they're able to get to you and make you think that there's a controversy and then you start waffling and then that's happened.
[00:47:30.385 --> 00:47:34.928]  I mean, there have been times where I thought I was a little bit wrong, so to just do the right thing, I admitted I was wrong.
[00:47:34.928 --> 00:47:37.770]  Then they all freak out and think I'm weak and it gets worse, so it's almost like
[00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:42.453]  I can't even say I'm wrong when I'm wrong, even though I want to, because the enemy twists it.
[00:47:42.453 --> 00:47:42.773]  No, no, no.
[00:47:42.773 --> 00:47:51.900]  So I've actually had this conversation with Shauna, because, you know, you're talking to your wife, people who love you, and I go, I go, babe, if we lived in a decent world, there are things that I would apologize for.
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.381]  I would say, you know, I went too far on that.
[00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:54.382]  I didn't mean that.
[00:47:54.382 --> 00:47:56.543]  I said, but we do not live in a decent world.
[00:47:56.543 --> 00:48:01.507]  We live in a world where an apology or human decency or Christian morality is blood in the water.
[00:48:01.507 --> 00:48:02.668]  You can't show any weakness.
[00:48:03.148 --> 00:48:06.331]  Exactly, because the people they've got following them are the followers, the idiots.
[00:48:06.331 --> 00:48:08.553]  And I'm sorry, we don't need you to change the world.
[00:48:08.553 --> 00:48:11.135]  You want to be scared of CNN, scared of Megyn Kelly, and scared of Tom Brokaw?
[00:48:21.485 --> 00:48:22.486]  Be scared of them.
[00:48:22.486 --> 00:48:24.347]  We have audiences bigger.
[00:48:24.347 --> 00:48:26.669]  It doesn't matter if they make 50 times the money.
[00:48:26.669 --> 00:48:28.771]  I want people to be awake and free.
[00:48:28.771 --> 00:48:29.351]  We're going to break.
[00:48:29.351 --> 00:48:30.512]  We're going to come back and get into Russia.
[00:48:30.512 --> 00:48:31.653]  It's the big enchilada.
[00:48:31.653 --> 00:48:33.774]  I think this is how they undermine Trump.
[00:48:33.774 --> 00:48:35.816]  This is how they get his base to really turn against him.
[00:48:35.816 --> 00:48:37.157]  Because we've been on the inside of this.
[00:48:37.157 --> 00:48:38.398]  You've got big sources.
[00:48:38.398 --> 00:48:41.961]  We know he's been against the war, against Syria.
[00:48:41.961 --> 00:48:43.622]  They're trying to manipulate him right now.
[00:48:43.622 --> 00:48:44.182]  The U.S.
[00:48:44.182 --> 00:48:46.304]  and Russia are in a major showdown.
[00:48:46.304 --> 00:48:47.045]  First off though,
[00:48:47.992 --> 00:48:53.316]  I've decided, quite frankly, to bring in some of the biggest sales in our history.
[00:48:53.316 --> 00:48:56.859]  And you notice the last year or so we have more and more big sales because we've done it.
[00:48:56.859 --> 00:48:59.781]  We've habitualized the audience to always having sales.
[00:48:59.781 --> 00:49:02.603]  So you don't buy anything if there's not a sale.
[00:49:02.603 --> 00:49:09.188]  But I'm not like some of the big shops out there that raise their price and then have a sale, but it's really at the regular retail.
[00:49:09.188 --> 00:49:13.291]  You'll notice over the years the products are the same price, even though with some products the price has gone up for us.
[00:49:15.128 --> 00:49:15.529]  I don't know.
[00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:29.934]  That is the sale, and then the sale price, you know, is the regular price, because that's how we fund our operation.
[00:49:29.934 --> 00:49:31.916]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've had free shipping for a week.
[00:49:31.916 --> 00:49:33.597]  It's going to end in a couple days.

[00:54:12.935 --> 00:54:16.017]  Alright, Paul Watson's coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:16.017 --> 00:54:18.658]  We're gonna open the phones up and take your phone calls as well.
[00:54:18.658 --> 00:54:21.159]  Watson's just on for two segments.
[00:54:21.159 --> 00:54:24.141]  We've got this supposed right-wing terror attack that we decry.
[00:54:24.141 --> 00:54:26.922]  One Islamist, one Muslim killed.
[00:54:26.922 --> 00:54:29.003]  A lot of weird stuff going on around the story.
[00:54:29.003 --> 00:54:33.786]  The man was already hurt in the street with people around him and then was in front of a mosque and then somebody ran into them.
[00:54:33.786 --> 00:54:35.647]  So we're trying to figure out exactly
[00:54:36.588 --> 00:54:37.788]  What's going on there?
[00:54:37.788 --> 00:54:46.996]  We've got a bunch of other big developments, but the big one is U.S.-led coalition downing of Syrian plane, active aggression, and support for terrorists.
[00:54:46.996 --> 00:54:52.300]  Moscow views the U.S.-led coalition attack on Syrian government military jet as an act of aggression.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:55:00.687]  Now, if you search engine President Trump, no boots on the ground, no Syrian war, you'll see our article that Paul Watson wrote.
[00:55:02.651 --> 00:55:10.234]  Four days before mainstream media wrote the exact same article, because that was real White House sources.
[00:55:10.234 --> 00:55:19.198]  The only reason I point that out is, time and time and time and time and time and time and time again, we break and roll out what's really going on.
[00:55:19.198 --> 00:55:23.640]  Trump said no to troops in Syria, his aides aren't so sure, McMaster and others.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.601]  Now if you go back four days before that,
[00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:27.601]  Just type in InfoWars.com.
[00:55:27.601 --> 00:55:29.382]  You don't search InfoWars.com.
[00:55:29.382 --> 00:55:39.145]  In Google, you put in InfoWars.com, and then you type in Trump not planning Ryder-Syria war, no boots on the ground, and you'll get Paul Watson's article.
[00:55:39.145 --> 00:55:41.686]  If you guys can't find it, call Paul.
[00:55:41.686 --> 00:55:42.966]  We must show everyone this.
[00:55:42.966 --> 00:55:44.767]  We must show it or just shut the show down.
[00:55:44.767 --> 00:55:47.247]  Because we have to show folks that we're not the fake news.
[00:55:47.247 --> 00:55:48.728]  How we set it first from our sources.
[00:55:49.548 --> 00:55:53.610]  And then how four days later, word for word, that's what the President came out and said.
[00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.910]  Because that was from the President.
[00:55:55.910 --> 00:56:01.873]  Well, and I broke the story, too, how McMaster was pushing for a troop ground war in Syria, too.
[00:56:01.873 --> 00:56:06.654]  McMaster's war before Eli Lake did, and those guys in the fake news media do.
[00:56:06.654 --> 00:56:13.457]  And so, when will NBC do a special on storiesinfowars.com had before everybody else?
[00:56:13.917 --> 00:56:14.837]  Why is that?
[00:56:14.837 --> 00:56:15.718]  They want to pick two or three.
[00:56:15.718 --> 00:56:16.278]  We won't do them.
[00:56:16.278 --> 00:56:17.539]  I've asked my crew.
[00:56:17.539 --> 00:56:18.379]  We need to do that.
[00:56:18.379 --> 00:56:21.500]  Yeah, you need to do a big... We're always so busy covering the latest.
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:28.563]  Yeah, but you gotta take... You had some of the same sources, so tell folks the battle, because the big deal is here, not even about credit, they're trying to maneuver Trump.
[00:56:28.563 --> 00:56:30.144]  They've got the artillery on the ground.
[00:56:30.144 --> 00:56:31.084]  They've got it all set up.
[00:56:31.084 --> 00:56:35.266]  They're trying to tell him to take out ISIS, but we have McMaster saying he wants to take out Assad as well.
[00:56:35.746 --> 00:56:37.628]  Yeah, they're going to get the World War III.
[00:56:37.628 --> 00:56:44.113]  They want Iran, they want a drag in Russia, so they're talking about we need to worry about Iran, we need to worry about Syria.
[00:56:44.113 --> 00:56:47.976]  Even though in Syria you can actually be a Christian in Syria.
[00:56:47.976 --> 00:56:54.741]  You can't be a Christian in Saudi Arabia, but we're selling weapons and arms to Saudi Arabia, where you can't be a Christian, you can't be a Jew.
[00:56:54.741 --> 00:56:55.402]  But in Syria,
[00:56:56.222 --> 00:56:58.063]  You can be a Christian.
[00:56:58.063 --> 00:56:58.583]  Wow.
[00:56:58.583 --> 00:57:00.484]  What is the common theme here?
[00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:03.606]  This is ultimately a war on Christianity.
[00:57:03.606 --> 00:57:05.707]  That is what the fake news media is doing.
[00:57:05.707 --> 00:57:10.389]  Any country where Christianity is allowed, they want war and carnage.
[00:57:10.389 --> 00:57:11.129]  Gotta call Paul.
[00:57:11.129 --> 00:57:12.910]  I just, I have this OCD thing.
[00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:14.651]  I didn't used to be OCD.
[00:57:14.651 --> 00:57:18.393]  But then if I have an article and I know we broke it and we can't find it, I can't even do the show.
[00:57:18.393 --> 00:57:18.953]  I have to go up here.
[00:57:19.093 --> 00:57:24.618]  Yeah, okay, they can also go to my Medium, my Medium.com page, McMaster wants ground war in Syria.
[00:57:24.618 --> 00:57:33.605]  So McMaster has been, that's at my Medium.com forward slash S Cernovich, that was another story, how McMaster is pushing hard for ground war in Syria.
[00:57:33.605 --> 00:57:34.866]  Now here's what you'll learn.
[00:57:34.866 --> 00:57:36.947]  I learned this from Christian Orthodox people.
[00:57:37.728 --> 00:57:39.409]  That visited Syria.
[00:57:39.409 --> 00:57:43.191]  You can actually set, so yeah, Petraeus and McMaster have taken over the NSC.
[00:57:43.191 --> 00:57:45.372]  They want massive ground war in Syria.
[00:57:45.372 --> 00:57:46.813]  That was April 9th.
[00:57:46.813 --> 00:57:55.358]  I had also done a story before that where I talked about how McMaster had been manipulating intelligence reports for the president and wanted 150,000 ground troops in Syria.
[00:57:55.358 --> 00:57:57.759]  And then of course people go, oh, you're fake news.
[00:57:57.759 --> 00:57:59.360]  There's no ground war in Syria.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:04.163]  Yeah, because it takes a long time to manipulate these things in action.
[00:58:04.163 --> 00:58:06.224]  I mean, think about the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[00:58:06.844 --> 00:58:09.487]  That's something the fake news media will never talk about.
[00:58:09.487 --> 00:58:20.738]  Why don't we do a special on NBC or ABC about the Gulf of Tonkin incident and how there have been false flag operations to drag us into a war?
[00:58:20.738 --> 00:58:22.240]  The media never wants to talk about that.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.401]  I find that fascinating.
[00:58:24.742 --> 00:58:27.764]  Could there be another Gulf of Tonkin incident?
[00:58:27.764 --> 00:58:33.968]  Could this plane being shot down be another fake Gulf of Tonkin incident to drag us into war?
[00:58:33.968 --> 00:58:37.410]  And let's be clear, they'll say that we're saying no plane got shot down, no.
[00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:41.793]  You can give the military orders that Trump hasn't actually given because he's turned the military loose.
[00:58:41.793 --> 00:58:44.275]  People inside then can use that to try to start a war.
[00:58:44.275 --> 00:58:45.475]  We know that's their strategy.
[00:58:45.475 --> 00:58:48.377]  You broke it from your sources the same weekend we broke it.
[00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:49.858]  So we did show your side.
[00:58:49.858 --> 00:58:51.079]  Yes, he was right first!
[00:58:51.079 --> 00:58:51.820]  We was right!
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:52.580]  We found the article!
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:53.180]  At least he had it!
[00:58:54.121 --> 00:58:54.541]  We're good to go.
[00:59:18.376 --> 00:59:21.737]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:59:21.737 --> 00:59:24.738]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:59:24.738 --> 00:59:28.439]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:59:28.439 --> 00:59:35.341]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:59:35.341 --> 00:59:42.843]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[00:59:42.843 --> 00:59:45.804]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[00:59:45.984 --> 00:59:47.405]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:22.964 --> 01:00:25.609]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:30.758]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:42.463 --> 01:00:45.785]  Anyways, ladies and gentlemen, Mike Cernovich is here.
[01:00:45.785 --> 01:00:51.889]  We know the bigger story is they're trying to start a war in Syria with this proxy war, where Trump says they're not going to have a wider war.
[01:00:51.889 --> 01:00:55.452]  We want to get rid of ISIS, Al Qaeda, but then others want to start a larger war.
[01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:56.793]  They're shipping in the artillery.
[01:00:56.793 --> 01:00:57.713]  They're setting it all up.
[01:00:57.713 --> 01:00:58.414]  They're getting it ready.
[01:00:58.414 --> 01:01:04.218]  Paul Watson's coming up in the next segment to get into a supposed right-wing terror attack in London and more.
[01:01:04.218 --> 01:01:05.819]  But Mike Cernovich, get into the breaking news.
[01:01:05.819 --> 01:01:11.602]  I know you told us yesterday from your sources that you were going to be releasing this soon, but I guess it's already breaking.
[01:01:11.602 --> 01:01:12.143]  Tell us about it.
[01:01:12.483 --> 01:01:27.706]  Yeah, so I found out from multiple sources now have confirmed it, and I believe you maybe wrote about this a year ago, but the Clinton Foundation is actually laundering money and paying off ISIS to protect a certain cement factory in Syria.
[01:01:27.706 --> 01:01:28.766]  This is breaking news.
[01:01:28.766 --> 01:01:33.367]  I just got this from the top-level people, personally inspected it.
[01:01:33.367 --> 01:01:41.708]  So there are all these cement factories in Syria, and what is happening is that the cement factory is paying money to the Clinton Global Initiative.
[01:01:42.148 --> 01:01:49.436]  And then the Clinton Global Initiative is using its contractors and sources to pay off ISIS to not bomb this cement factory.
[01:01:49.436 --> 01:01:51.057]  So the story is still developing.
[01:01:51.057 --> 01:01:54.461]  I haven't broken it yet on mymedium.com, but it's still in draft form.
[01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:55.902]  But I wanted to get that out right away.
[01:01:55.902 --> 01:01:57.584]  I meant to break it last night, but we got so busy.
[01:01:57.584 --> 01:01:58.846]  So we have proof now.
[01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:09.154]  Sources, the most reliable sources you can have, that the Clinton Foundation is actually giving money to ISIS as part of an extortion racket with the cement factory.
[01:02:09.154 --> 01:02:12.236]  So yes, this story here has now been confirmed.
[01:02:12.236 --> 01:02:12.716]  This is now not
[01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.740]  This is now not, what do you say, possible.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.320]  This is actually true.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.882]  The Clinton Foundation, they're still doing it.
[01:02:21.882 --> 01:02:23.222]  They're paying money to ISIS.
[01:02:23.222 --> 01:02:24.743]  They are funding terrorism.
[01:02:24.743 --> 01:02:28.225]  So when you say Hillary Clinton is a terrorist, she is a terrorist.
[01:02:28.225 --> 01:02:29.306]  They're paying money to ISIS.
[01:02:29.306 --> 01:02:30.666]  It can no longer be denied.
[01:02:30.666 --> 01:02:31.747]  We have confirmation.
[01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:34.288]  And I believe you broke that story before.
[01:02:34.288 --> 01:02:35.389]  It's still ongoing.
[01:02:35.389 --> 01:02:37.170]  Well, I don't mean to freak out about who breaks stories.
[01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.911]  I can't stand it when I can't find one.
[01:02:39.651 --> 01:02:41.732]  One that was particularly from a high-level White House source.
[01:02:41.732 --> 01:02:42.532]  I remember writing it.
[01:02:42.532 --> 01:02:43.132]  I remember doing it.
[01:02:43.132 --> 01:02:45.533]  It was separate from the one from your sources about McMaster.
[01:02:45.533 --> 01:02:46.313]  It was backing that up.
[01:02:46.313 --> 01:02:52.614]  But it was from the President himself saying about your story, from your sources, that yes, we're not going to expand the war.
[01:02:52.614 --> 01:02:53.755]  I'm not going along with this.
[01:02:53.755 --> 01:02:56.635]  And three days later, Bloomberg picked up on that.
[01:02:56.635 --> 01:03:02.537]  It's the obsession with not being able to ever find, myself, the information to show it.
[01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:17.055]  But I mean, of course, ad nauseam, we spearheaded exposing that ISIS previously was Al Qaeda, and that six years ago they launched the Arab Spring, and they overthrew all these governments, and the news promoted it publicly, and then they tried to, you know, be Al Qaeda's air force and ISIS's air force.
[01:03:18.001 --> 01:03:26.965]  When our guests, like Colonel Schaeffer and others, spearheaded exposing that, then Senator Paul covered it, then Senator, the guy from Texas, Cruz, covered it.
[01:03:26.965 --> 01:03:33.088]  And so yes, when Trump then later says, you funded ISIS, you created ISIS, Hillary, and Obama, that's true.
[01:03:33.088 --> 01:03:41.332]  The media then thinks we're all geographically and geopolitically and militarily and historically completely illiterate.
[01:03:41.332 --> 01:03:43.954]  And so they just say, no, you're liars, just like they think.
[01:03:44.915 --> 01:03:49.822]  That we don't know that Comey said in two testimonies that Trump never tried to get him to obstruct justice.
[01:03:49.822 --> 01:03:50.884]  We even have the video clips.
[01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:52.086]  They just say we're liars.
[01:03:52.086 --> 01:03:53.308]  So it's that frustration.
[01:03:53.308 --> 01:03:53.949]  It's not with you.
[01:03:53.949 --> 01:03:54.750]  It's not with the crew.
[01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:57.294]  I just occasionally, I never used to be OCD.
[01:03:57.294 --> 01:03:58.295]  I've got this thing now.
[01:03:59.093 --> 01:04:05.976]  Where I just, I know what the news was, I know what it was, I know what it said, which we already found a bunch where you said it, so it doesn't matter.
[01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:08.198]  The point is, that's not the bigger issue.
[01:04:08.198 --> 01:04:15.581]  I'm pissed off, excuse me, because I realize they're about to try to start a major war to take control of things from Trump.
[01:04:15.581 --> 01:04:17.782]  So his one blind spot is saying, I trust the military.
[01:04:17.782 --> 01:04:27.107]  Well, the military's good overall, they're good people, but the globalists at the top of the military can use this to then basically destabilize Trump or start major wars.
[01:04:27.347 --> 01:04:31.630]  Because even though he's given them the main directives, clearly people above him are trying to start a major war.
[01:04:57.508 --> 01:04:58.393]  That doesn't exist.
[01:04:58.393 --> 01:04:59.197]  We never said it.
[01:04:59.197 --> 01:04:59.860]  Isn't it?
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:00.161]  Not real.
[01:05:01.235 --> 01:05:05.537]  Lost in the constant fake news cycle, we have forgotten the building tensions in Syria.
[01:05:05.537 --> 01:05:10.820]  Until this morning, when news broke of a Syrian Army plane being shot down by a United States F-18.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:15.522]  This is the first Syrian aircraft to have been downed by the United States since 2011.
[01:05:15.522 --> 01:05:22.966]  Washington justified the strike, claiming the jet dropped bombs near U.S.-backed forces, while officials from Damascus said they were attacking ISIS.
[01:05:22.966 --> 01:05:25.708]  Truth be told, these are most likely the same group.
[01:05:25.708 --> 01:05:28.529]  But we should be asking John McCain that question.
[01:05:28.709 --> 01:05:31.391]  Russia has responded by saying it will now treat U.S.
[01:05:31.391 --> 01:05:34.133]  aircraft operating in Syria as targets.
[01:05:34.133 --> 01:05:39.776]  President Trump can't get a microphone loud enough to ask for the Russia collusion investigation to be over.
[01:05:39.776 --> 01:05:43.779]  But don't hold your breath on the Democrats finding common sense and logic overnight.
[01:05:43.779 --> 01:05:46.521]  President Trump will still be investigated for collusion with Russia.
[01:05:46.741 --> 01:05:49.023]  While they are threatening him and our country.
[01:05:49.023 --> 01:05:56.409]  President Trump, the globalists are trying to trap you and trick you into a war in Syria in hopes it will cost you the 2020 election.
[01:05:56.409 --> 01:05:57.250]  Don't fall for it.
[01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.571]  Make America great again.
[01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:00.933]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:06:00.933 --> 01:06:11.362]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:06:11.502 --> 01:06:13.565]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[01:06:13.565 --> 01:06:16.449]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:06:16.449 --> 01:06:17.931]  It's made in the USA.
[01:06:17.931 --> 01:06:24.760]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.022]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:06:26.823 --> 01:06:36.527]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:06:36.527 --> 01:06:53.355]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:06:53.355 --> 01:06:56.496]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:06:56.636 --> 01:07:00.618]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:00.618 --> 01:07:09.703]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:09.703 --> 01:07:17.807]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:18.107 --> 01:07:22.991]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:22.991 --> 01:07:29.776]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:29.776 --> 01:07:36.962]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:36.962 --> 01:07:38.643]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[01:07:38.803 --> 01:07:39.344]  We're good to go.
[01:08:14.108 --> 01:08:19.336]  Alright, earlier in the mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:08:19.336 --> 01:08:21.018]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:22.681]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:22.681 --> 01:08:27.308]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.292 --> 01:08:33.994]  Earlier in the last hour, I was getting into the big critical story that affects us all.
[01:08:33.994 --> 01:08:39.636]  A major Cuban missile crisis level showdown between the United States and Russia.
[01:08:39.636 --> 01:08:46.238]  Now, because a second time in the last month and a half, the United States has bombed an armored convoy that was battling ISIS forces.
[01:08:46.238 --> 01:08:47.578]  That's admitted.
[01:08:47.578 --> 01:08:53.561]  And then now a Syrian government warplane has been shot down, reportedly, by U.S.
[01:08:53.561 --> 01:08:54.281]  forces.
[01:08:54.281 --> 01:08:56.262]  This was flying too close to U.S.
[01:08:56.262 --> 01:08:57.222]  forces on the ground.
[01:08:58.755 --> 01:09:11.917]  Now, a few months ago, back in April, the neocons of McMaster and others on the National Security Council, the National Security Advisor, was pushing for more troops on the ground and to go ahead and take out Assad as well.
[01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:19.228]  I talked to my White House sources and they said, the President said, absolutely not.
[01:09:19.228 --> 01:09:20.890]  That is not going to happen.
[01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:23.252]  It doesn't matter if they're pushing that, it's not going to happen.
[01:09:23.252 --> 01:09:25.013]  Paul Watson wrote the article.
[01:09:25.013 --> 01:09:28.656]  White House source, very high level source, very high level source.
[01:09:28.656 --> 01:09:32.560]  Trump pushes back against Neotan plan to invade Syria.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.783]  In fact, that was the last time I talked to that high level source.
[01:09:35.783 --> 01:09:38.245]  Well, that was back in April.
[01:09:38.245 --> 01:09:39.185]  It breaks it all down.
[01:09:39.185 --> 01:09:40.387]  Then three days later,
[01:09:41.388 --> 01:09:44.609]  Bloomberg, AP, everybody reported the exact same thing.
[01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:45.290]  He pushed back.
[01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:48.691]  He said, no, do not mass troops for this.
[01:09:48.691 --> 01:09:49.831]  They're putting artillery in.
[01:09:49.831 --> 01:09:50.932]  They put the Marines in.
[01:09:50.932 --> 01:09:53.073]  They're gearing up for a wider war.
[01:09:53.073 --> 01:09:55.053]  So Trump is being truthful.
[01:09:55.053 --> 01:09:58.395]  Trump is sticking by what he said he would do.
[01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:01.996]  The problem is he's being ignored by the deep state on so many fronts.
[01:10:01.996 --> 01:10:06.238]  And now you've got this major, major, major, major clash.
[01:10:07.759 --> 01:10:11.590]  Where anytime this could escalate, what happens if more US forces go in?
[01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:17.491]  What happens if Russian aircraft or Syrian aircraft get shot down?
[01:10:17.491 --> 01:10:18.452]  What happens if U.S.
[01:10:18.452 --> 01:10:21.853]  aircraft go in and the Russians shoot them down?
[01:10:21.853 --> 01:10:28.975]  Things are escalating very, very quickly, and we're on the wrong side when we're trying to take out the Assad government because he didn't start the civil war.
[01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:39.798]  Paul Joseph Watson, our London bureau chief and the editor of Infowars.com, joins us to talk about this, but then another terror attack in London, this time one dead.
[01:10:39.798 --> 01:10:42.199]  This time we hear it's a right-winger that did it.
[01:10:42.999 --> 01:10:46.941]  And the leftist media is calling for war over it.
[01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:51.743]  They're not calling for unity and peace and love before the blood's even dry and we even know what happened.
[01:10:51.743 --> 01:10:53.603]  So we'll cover both those stories.
[01:10:53.603 --> 01:10:56.325]  Paul, which one do you want to tackle first?
[01:10:56.325 --> 01:11:00.466]  Let's talk about the terror attack, Alex, because that's what I've been covering today.
[01:11:00.466 --> 01:11:04.368]  Again, a right-wing terrorist drove into a group of Muslims near a mosque in
[01:11:04.918 --> 01:11:05.818]  North London.
[01:11:05.818 --> 01:11:08.080]  Disgusting, tragic, reprehensible.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.641]  We've decried violence on both sides for eternity.
[01:11:11.641 --> 01:11:19.865]  We've said that the lack of solutions to address Islamic terrorism will cause extremists on the other side of the equation to fill the vacuum.
[01:11:19.865 --> 01:11:21.626]  Said that numerous times.
[01:11:21.626 --> 01:11:22.747]  Now it's happening.
[01:11:22.747 --> 01:11:23.867]  But of course, who's to blame?
[01:11:23.867 --> 01:11:24.727]  Well, it's us.
[01:11:24.727 --> 01:11:25.868]  We'll get into that.
[01:11:25.868 --> 01:11:34.032]  But like you said, Alex, I thought the proper way to respond, the reasonable way to respond to terror attacks, was just for everybody to love each other and unite.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:38.305]  I thought that was how we were all supposed to respond to terrorism.
[01:11:50.745 --> 01:11:54.827]  They're calling for Tommy Robinson to be arrested as a hate preacher.
[01:11:54.827 --> 01:11:58.448]  They're calling for me to be deported, even though I'm a British citizen.
[01:11:58.448 --> 01:11:59.649]  Doesn't quite work out.
[01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.670]  They're calling for Katie Hopkins to be arrested.
[01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:09.953]  Isn't it strange, Alex, how they're reacting in a completely different way to how they normally react to terrorist attacks?
[01:12:09.953 --> 01:12:17.096]  You know, after numerous Islamic terrorist attacks over the past two years, we've had celebrities say that
[01:12:18.192 --> 01:12:22.516]  Muslims are being radicalized because they're not being given enough movie roles.
[01:12:22.516 --> 01:12:28.441]  There's not enough diversity in Hollywood and that's causing young Muslims to turn towards ISIS.
[01:12:28.441 --> 01:12:33.705]  Well maybe Alex, we're just not giving enough movie roles to right-wing violent extremists.
[01:12:33.705 --> 01:12:37.027]  Maybe that's the result, that's the cause of this terror attack.
[01:12:37.027 --> 01:12:39.369]  So again, complete hypocrites.
[01:12:39.369 --> 01:12:40.470]  Well when I go to the mall...
[01:12:41.741 --> 01:12:45.104]  I see Gap now, their main centerpiece, is a woman in a hijab.
[01:12:45.104 --> 01:12:47.286]  The leftist marches are handing out hijabs.
[01:12:47.286 --> 01:12:51.869]  They're actually saying we need to accept them and accept Sharia, then they'll stop killing us.
[01:12:51.869 --> 01:12:53.631]  But they don't do that in the Middle East.
[01:12:53.631 --> 01:12:58.355]  They kill each other and the most radicals are then in charge and control the dialogue.
[01:12:59.656 --> 01:13:00.217]  No, exactly.
[01:13:00.217 --> 01:13:07.327]  After every single Islamic attack, they blame us because they say we might offend Muslims who then might become terrorists.
[01:13:07.327 --> 01:13:10.031]  Well, one, that's the bigotry of low expectations.
[01:13:10.031 --> 01:13:14.317]  You're saying that random Muslims will just turn into terrorists because they're offended.
[01:13:15.236 --> 01:13:17.218]  And two, again, it's the hypocrisy, Alex.
[01:13:17.218 --> 01:13:22.463]  They're trying to equate this threat of right-wing terrorism, which we decry.
[01:13:22.463 --> 01:13:25.485]  The right disavows its fringe violent extremists.
[01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.007]  The left doesn't.
[01:13:27.007 --> 01:13:30.950]  You saw they were celebrating after the attack on Scalise last week.
[01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:32.992]  Every single time there's an Islamist terror attack,
[01:13:33.547 --> 01:13:34.907]  They make apologies for it.
[01:13:34.907 --> 01:13:36.508]  They stick their heads in the sand.
[01:13:36.508 --> 01:13:41.990]  And let me tell you, Paul, it's creepy watching a bunch of mainly old New Yorkers that look completely wimpy.
[01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:43.010]  I'm not bashing old folks.
[01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:44.711]  A lot of old folks are really tough and awesome.
[01:13:44.711 --> 01:13:45.811]  They're patriots.
[01:13:45.811 --> 01:13:54.774]  But liberal old people, all chicken-necked, all weird, wearing their rainbow shirts, clapping and getting off on the simulated murder of Trump.
[01:13:54.774 --> 01:13:56.774]  It's just they're such hypocrites.
[01:13:56.774 --> 01:13:57.855]  They're such frauds.
[01:13:58.855 --> 01:14:04.277]  They never stick by, you know, anything that's logical, and they are just lusting after violence.
[01:14:29.079 --> 01:14:36.368]  Islamic terrorists have killed 1,263 people in the last 23 days alone, Alex.
[01:14:36.368 --> 01:14:39.892]  That's the grand total for Ramadan so far.
[01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:47.861]  So for people to take these sporadic right-wing terror attacks, which are deplorable and we disavow them, and make any kind of comparison
[01:14:48.168 --> 01:14:56.811]  to the mechanised industrial bloodshed carried out in the name of Islam on a daily basis is intellectually dishonest and crass.
[01:14:56.811 --> 01:15:02.874]  Just in the time we've been discussing this today, two more Islamic terror attacks in Europe.
[01:15:02.874 --> 01:15:06.135]  One in Paris, a guy tried to blow up some police in a vehicle.
[01:15:06.135 --> 01:15:09.236]  Another guy in London shot an Al-Araq bar with knives.
[01:15:09.236 --> 01:15:11.377]  They arrested him, tried to attack a policeman.
[01:15:11.377 --> 01:15:13.878]  Within minutes, they said, not terror-related.
[01:15:14.349 --> 01:15:19.813]  So just in the time we were reacting to this, we had two more attempted Islamic terror attacks.
[01:15:19.813 --> 01:15:23.796]  To make any kind of comparison is completely dishonest.
[01:15:23.796 --> 01:15:35.544]  But again, if you leave that vacuum, if you don't have actual solutions of border security, deporting terrorists, then it's going to create a vacuum for actual extremists on the rise, who become desperate and try to fill it.
[01:15:35.544 --> 01:15:38.347]  And then that's going to be the clash of civilizations, so let's talk about where that goes.
[01:15:38.347 --> 01:15:41.269]  But first off, I saw a trailer for the new Handmaiden's Tale.
[01:15:41.809 --> 01:15:49.135]  You know, that's a leftist book about a right-wing dictatorship where, you know, they have women as concubines and sex slavery and make them wear hoods over their heads.
[01:15:49.135 --> 01:15:54.620]  It's basically projecting onto Christianity what orthodox Islam's doing.
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:16:02.026]  I saw the new ad for this and it looks like the police state that the left's actually trying to set up.
[01:16:02.026 --> 01:16:08.792]  And then separately, I also see other movies and other things that are coming out
[01:16:09.659 --> 01:16:24.337]  Where they project onto us what in reality, and I know you're not even really a Christian, but they project onto Western civilization the things that they themselves are actually wanting to do.
[01:16:24.337 --> 01:16:29.023]  And then they have movies like The Purge, where one night out of the year you can go around and kill whoever you want.
[01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:38.137]  But, at the same time, Ramadan's like a month or more where you can go around and murder everybody, run to Islam, kill people that aren't Muslims, whatever you want anyway.
[01:16:38.137 --> 01:16:47.925]  So, everything they're projecting onto right-wing America, or even Americana, which is classical liberalism, is what leftism actually is supporting in Islam.
[01:16:47.925 --> 01:16:52.149]  I mean, it's total inversion of reality.
[01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:55.672]  Exactly, and again, it comes down to the fact they don't disavow their extremists.
[01:16:55.672 --> 01:16:56.453]  Most people don't know.
[01:16:57.108 --> 01:17:02.249]  There's a guy called Michael Sanford who, a year ago, tried to actually assassinate Trump at a rally.
[01:17:02.249 --> 01:17:05.209]  Tried to grab an officer's gun and kill him.
[01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:07.270]  How did the left respond to that?
[01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:10.390]  They actually made a documentary, the BBC.
[01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:14.971]  It was basically a puff piece saying, oh, he was just this misunderstood young man.
[01:17:14.971 --> 01:17:18.152]  Literally tried to gun down Trump in cold blood.
[01:17:18.152 --> 01:17:19.952]  That's just one example of many.
[01:17:19.952 --> 01:17:25.853]  They always lionise and justify violent extremism, time after time after time.
[01:17:26.363 --> 01:17:28.244]  Oh, blame it on Western foreign policy.
[01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:29.304]  That's the real cause.
[01:17:29.304 --> 01:17:30.345]  That justifies it.
[01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:35.166]  Well no, 90% of terrorism victims are other Muslims because they're killing each other.
[01:17:35.166 --> 01:17:38.028]  Well sure, but take last week.
[01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:45.790]  With the Congressman, Wolf Blitzer had a guest on saying this guy wasn't evil, he was just upset and Wolf Blitzer didn't even disagree with him and justified it.
[01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:52.033]  I mean, these people are openly trying to prosecute terror and violence against us and are pushing people to do it.
[01:17:52.033 --> 01:17:54.614]  At what point, we haven't attacked offensively,
[01:17:55.094 --> 01:17:59.436]  At what point does defense become offense and these people start getting gunned down?
[01:17:59.436 --> 01:18:04.159]  I mean, I don't want that to happen, but if they're pushing violence, it's going to start.
[01:18:04.159 --> 01:18:08.721]  Well, there'll probably be hate mobs of leftists that actually try to lynch people.
[01:18:08.721 --> 01:18:10.382]  They'll probably go after Tommy Robinson.
[01:18:10.382 --> 01:18:19.146]  I mean, you've got all the same leftists who say absolutely nothing in response to every Islamic terror attack, literally calling for Tommy Robinson to be targeted.
[01:18:19.716 --> 01:18:21.297]  As a hate preacher.
[01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:27.922]  Okay, the difference is Tommy Robinson doesn't get up to 10 years in a mosque and celebrate ISIS terror attacks.
[01:18:27.922 --> 01:18:32.966]  He doesn't go and tell people to go and carry out violent attacks against anyone.
[01:18:32.966 --> 01:18:37.350]  We're calling for solutions that will end terrorism across the board.
[01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:39.211]  And for that we're labelled hate preachers.
[01:18:39.211 --> 01:18:39.611]  That's right.
[01:18:39.611 --> 01:18:44.215]  They're saying, oh, just like we go after the Islamic hate preachers, we need to go after Tommy Robinson.
[01:18:44.557 --> 01:18:47.479]  They don't go after Islamic hate preachers in the UK.
[01:18:47.479 --> 01:18:51.602]  They're allowed to preach in mosques for 10 years or more without being arrested.
[01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:53.664]  They're given platforms on television.
[01:18:53.664 --> 01:18:53.964]  Exactly.
[01:18:53.964 --> 01:18:55.345]  We should get Tommy Robinson on.
[01:18:55.345 --> 01:18:56.766]  He's never done anything violent.
[01:18:56.766 --> 01:18:57.647]  He's done nothing wrong.
[01:18:57.647 --> 01:19:01.090]  One more segment with Paul Watson, then I'm going to take your phone calls and cover other news.
[01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:03.752]  But since we mention it, here's Wolf Blitzer last week.
[01:19:04.572 --> 01:19:08.953]  The day of the attack, the day of the attack, and some of the other shows are condoning it.
[01:19:08.953 --> 01:19:13.675]  Huffington Post has writers saying, too bad it's not more organized, too bad it's not bigger.
[01:19:13.675 --> 01:19:15.955]  Here they are pushing this narrative.
[01:19:15.955 --> 01:19:28.499]  Stand by Art, we're just getting some tape in of an acquaintance of James Hodgkinson, the 66 year old shooter, describing some of his political, perhaps, motivations.
[01:19:28.499 --> 01:19:30.379]  Listen to this.
[01:19:30.379 --> 01:19:33.220]  I just want to let people know that he wasn't evil.
[01:19:34.418 --> 01:19:39.642]  That he was, I guess, tired of some of the politics that's going on.
[01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:40.783]  That's what we just heard.
[01:19:40.783 --> 01:19:44.365]  Perhaps he wasn't evil, just tired of the politics that's going on.
[01:19:44.365 --> 01:19:48.308]  I mean, they say, I'm so evil, don't let me on air, then misrepresent what I've said.
[01:19:48.308 --> 01:19:50.869]  And then meanwhile, they just have this on.
[01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.411]  I mean, these people, they're looking for a war.
[01:19:53.411 --> 01:19:56.894]  I want to ask Paul, what does he think they're going to do next?
[01:19:56.894 --> 01:20:00.036]  How does he think it's going for the globalists versus the nationalists?
[01:20:01.089 --> 01:20:04.810]  Diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety meds, everyone's on them.
[01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:13.853]  If you're a 50-year-old male, maybe a bit porky, and you may even have type 2 diabetes, a million dollars of term insurance may only cost you about 200 bucks a month.
[01:20:13.853 --> 01:20:15.133]  Call Term Provider.
[01:20:15.133 --> 01:20:19.475]  Speak with Big Lou at 800-503-7639.
[01:20:19.475 --> 01:20:25.177]  Big Lou will find a term life policy for you, even if you have type 2 diabetes, are overweight, or have high blood pressure.
[01:20:25.177 --> 01:20:29.678]  Term Provider has helped thousands of people like you who think they can't afford term life insurance.
[01:20:29.898 --> 01:20:35.302]  To buy a million dollars of affordable term life for you, all you need to do is call Big Lou at 800-503-7639.
[01:20:35.302 --> 01:20:38.304]  Lou is one of you, and he'll make sure the scales are tipped in your favor.
[01:20:38.304 --> 01:20:38.845]  Call 800-503-7639.
[01:20:44.969 --> 01:20:49.692]  Big Lew will answer your call and work to fit you into a term life policy that you can afford.
[01:20:49.692 --> 01:20:54.134]  Call Term Provider, speak with Big Lew, and save on term life.
[01:20:54.134 --> 01:20:54.434]  Call 800-503-7639.
[01:20:54.434 --> 01:20:54.475]  800-503-7639.
[01:21:00.698 --> 01:21:05.180]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:13.143]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[01:21:13.143 --> 01:21:16.144]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[01:21:16.144 --> 01:21:20.145]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[01:21:20.145 --> 01:21:22.826]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[01:21:22.826 --> 01:21:26.508]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.

[01:22:29.659 --> 01:22:29.759]  It's
[01:22:46.271 --> 01:22:49.133]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction
[01:23:02.182 --> 01:23:08.666]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?

[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.221]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[01:24:28.092 --> 01:24:34.293]  So, let me ask Paul Watson this question.
[01:24:34.293 --> 01:24:38.414]  Why is he calling this, and I'm not disagreeing with him, a right-wing terror attack in London?
[01:24:38.414 --> 01:24:43.755]  I guess just to be fair, because the left always makes excuses for all the countless Islamic attacks that happen.
[01:24:43.755 --> 01:24:52.577]  So somebody gets tired and strikes back, even though it's like, you know, one-one-thousands just of what the Islamicists have done during Ramadan, thousands of dead.
[01:24:53.527 --> 01:24:55.468]  But why call it a right-wing terror attack?
[01:24:55.468 --> 01:24:56.969]  Because I don't think we really know yet.
[01:24:56.969 --> 01:24:58.651]  I mean, we have some videos.
[01:24:58.651 --> 01:25:01.633]  We have some supposed Muslim witnesses.
[01:25:01.633 --> 01:25:04.535]  UK police investigating van attack in London as terrorism.
[01:25:04.535 --> 01:25:07.817]  So the New York Times is saying, investigate as terrorism.
[01:25:07.817 --> 01:25:10.399]  Paul, why are you saying it's a right-wing terror attack?
[01:25:12.079 --> 01:25:20.143]  Well, I think it's important to be intellectually consistent and not deny violent extremism, which is what the left does after every single terror attack.
[01:25:20.143 --> 01:25:23.264]  So we know, Alex, that there are violent right-wing extremists.
[01:25:23.264 --> 01:25:24.785]  They're sporadic.
[01:25:24.785 --> 01:25:27.646]  Like you said, this, unfortunately, is tragic.
[01:25:27.646 --> 01:25:28.747]  It's outrageous.
[01:25:28.747 --> 01:25:38.932]  Fortunately, only one person died, unlike Manchester, where 10 children had their arms and legs blown off, unlike Nice, where 84 people died and 400 plus were injured.
[01:25:38.932 --> 01:25:41.393]  So it's dishonest to say there's a comparable threat.
[01:25:41.772 --> 01:25:48.134]  But again, it's important to say that it is right-wing extremism, because extremism causes more extremism.
[01:25:48.134 --> 01:25:57.477]  And if you don't offer solutions, and if you shout down the people who are trying to offer solutions, then it's only going to cause a backlash by other extremists.
[01:25:57.477 --> 01:25:59.097]  And that's what we see happening.
[01:25:59.097 --> 01:26:01.878]  And that's what you were getting into before, Alex.
[01:26:01.878 --> 01:26:10.981]  I think, as I predicted before the attempted massacre, and let's call it what it was, it was an attempted massacre of Republican lawmakers, thankfully stopped,
[01:26:11.758 --> 01:26:16.699]  I predicted that, saying a social justice warrior would go postal and kill a lot of people.
[01:26:16.699 --> 01:26:18.919]  Fortunately, it didn't happen on that occasion.
[01:26:18.919 --> 01:26:19.819]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:26:19.819 --> 01:26:24.880]  There are going to be massacres by social justice warriors, and then we'll get blamed for it.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:31.582]  There's a huge riot probably going to happen on July 2nd, where they have these nationwide anti-Trump impeachment marches.
[01:26:31.582 --> 01:26:34.262]  Almost certainly there'll be violence during those.
[01:26:34.262 --> 01:26:39.243]  So it's all coming to a boiling point in this summer of rage that we now find ourselves in.
[01:26:41.445 --> 01:26:43.447]  What's the larger master plan?
[01:26:43.447 --> 01:26:46.511]  Soros is one of the main funders, other globalist groups.
[01:26:46.511 --> 01:26:50.255]  The left though, on Hollywood, TV, everywhere, I mean, they want war.
[01:26:50.255 --> 01:26:52.738]  How do you see this ending?
[01:26:52.738 --> 01:26:53.239]  Not good.
[01:26:53.239 --> 01:26:57.424]  I mean, you saw the guy in Alexandria.
[01:26:57.424 --> 01:26:59.126]  He couldn't shoot straight, basically.
[01:26:59.685 --> 01:27:06.848]  It was prevented from being a massacre by the fact that there were good guys with guns and the fact that he was useless at shooting.
[01:27:06.848 --> 01:27:10.609]  So there are, what, 70 million armed American gun owners?
[01:27:10.609 --> 01:27:13.551]  If they want to get into a shooting war, it's not going to go well for them.
[01:27:13.551 --> 01:27:15.752]  But again, they're the ones pushing that.
[01:27:15.752 --> 01:27:24.095]  You had the punch a Nazi narrative, Alex, for months and months that it was acceptable to physically violently attack people because you disagree with them politically.
[01:27:24.645 --> 01:27:28.666]  You had people up on stage at award shows shouting, punch a Nazi!
[01:27:28.666 --> 01:27:31.207]  Leftist directors, okay?
[01:27:31.207 --> 01:27:38.328]  Any violence that happens, they're responsible for it because they didn't disavow it, they encouraged it, they legitimized it.
[01:27:38.328 --> 01:27:46.370]  So no, you don't have the moral high ground when you point your finger at us and lecture us about extremism and violence, when you're the ones who
[01:27:47.068 --> 01:27:50.529]  You know, curated it for months and months beforehand.
[01:27:50.529 --> 01:27:52.869]  Now it's happening on a more regular basis.
[01:27:52.869 --> 01:27:57.070]  The left is firmly to blame for that.
[01:27:57.070 --> 01:28:05.152]  That's why Ted Nugent has never been for offensive violence, but he said if they, you know, go after us, we have a right to fight back against them.
[01:28:05.152 --> 01:28:09.754]  He's saying everybody should disavow violence right now because that's what the globalists want.
[01:28:09.754 --> 01:28:10.874]  They want us to have a civil war.
[01:28:12.932 --> 01:28:20.955]  Well, it's the whole argument which is going on between more establishment conservatives and the alt-right or the alt-right, whatever you want to call them.
[01:28:20.955 --> 01:28:29.239]  Do we actually embrace the tactics of the left, the tactics of Saul Alinsky, and use the left's own tactics against them?
[01:28:29.239 --> 01:28:33.300]  Which you saw in the aftermath of the Trump assassination play.
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:42.744]  Again, there's this outrage mob mentality that now targets the left, calls for people to boycott them, calls for people on CNN celebrating that play.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.240]  To be fired.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:49.062]  So you have this strange scenario, and this is a huge debate going on within the conservative movement.
[01:28:49.062 --> 01:28:58.326]  Do we take on the tactics of the left, which, let's be honest, have been quite successful in prior years, use them against them, like Saul Alinsky said?
[01:28:58.326 --> 01:28:59.067]  Well, I want to be clear.
[01:28:59.067 --> 01:28:59.927]  I want to be clear.
[01:28:59.927 --> 01:29:04.969]  I don't want to offensively be violent, but I do think people should take over these violent plays.
[01:29:04.969 --> 01:29:07.290]  They should get in their face.
[01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:09.771]  We should hijack the media when it's legal.
[01:29:12.881 --> 01:29:13.461]  No, exactly.
[01:29:13.461 --> 01:29:18.963]  I mean, there are certain ways you can do it without being a hypocrite, but again, that's the big debate that's going on.
[01:29:18.963 --> 01:29:29.827]  Because for decades and decades, conservatives have just remained pretty much mute, and they've lost, lost, lost over and over again, especially in terms of the culture war, and politically.
[01:29:29.827 --> 01:29:35.909]  So that's why that debate is happening now, because it's having some success by embracing those kind of tactics.
[01:29:36.309 --> 01:29:39.131]  And the left doesn't see how hypocritical they are.
[01:29:39.131 --> 01:29:40.873]  I mean, I never thought of myself as right-wing.
[01:29:40.873 --> 01:29:42.414]  I'm just a libertarian.
[01:29:42.414 --> 01:29:44.976]  The left are crazed.
[01:29:44.976 --> 01:29:46.197]  Thank you, Paul Watson.
[01:29:46.197 --> 01:29:48.078]  Your phone calls and breaking news straight ahead.
[01:29:48.078 --> 01:29:49.099]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:49.099 --> 01:29:50.200]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.581]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.581 --> 01:29:54.123]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.123 --> 01:29:56.805]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.158 --> 01:30:03.680]  Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:12.747]  On Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage of the New York Public Disgrace Theater showing of Caesar, which should really be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination of President Trump.
[01:30:12.747 --> 01:30:22.034]  She rushed the stage insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands, as well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[01:30:22.034 --> 01:30:29.740]  While she was being arrested, Jack Posobiec went live on Twitter to broadcast the event, and then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:30.560]  We're good to go.
[01:30:49.207 --> 01:30:57.820]  Rumor has it some of the police involved support the protest against the expression of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York Public Theater against our president.
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:00.384]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:31:01.027 --> 01:31:01.827]  Embrics Essentials.
[01:31:01.827 --> 01:31:02.948]  That's my middle name.
[01:31:02.948 --> 01:31:15.372]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[01:31:15.372 --> 01:31:21.154]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[01:31:21.334 --> 01:31:24.515]  High-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[01:31:24.515 --> 01:31:29.156]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[01:31:29.156 --> 01:31:36.278]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[01:31:36.278 --> 01:31:37.438]  It's all there.
[01:31:37.438 --> 01:31:42.859]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[01:31:42.859 --> 01:31:46.720]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials,
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:53.582]  And it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:53.582 --> 01:31:56.203]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.

[01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:05.105]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[01:32:05.105 --> 01:32:06.366]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:07.821]  Great!
[01:32:07.821 --> 01:32:08.922]  Hey, thank you so much.

[01:32:13.465 --> 01:32:22.750]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:23.490]  Wow, thank you.
[01:32:23.490 --> 01:32:25.952]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:32:25.952 --> 01:32:27.793]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[01:32:27.793 --> 01:32:31.255]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[01:32:31.255 --> 01:32:31.675]  That's amazing.
[01:32:31.935 --> 01:32:36.036]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.

[01:33:40.055 --> 01:33:40.635]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:40.635 --> 01:33:40.916]  Central.
[01:33:40.916 --> 01:33:41.476]  We're here live.
[01:33:41.476 --> 01:33:44.036]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:44.036 --> 01:33:49.138]  Coming up today, we're going to have Mike Cernovich popping back in.
[01:33:49.138 --> 01:33:49.638]  He's here.
[01:33:49.638 --> 01:33:50.859]  Joe Biggs is going to be in studio.
[01:33:50.859 --> 01:33:53.079]  I want to open the phones up and take your calls.
[01:33:53.079 --> 01:33:55.800]  David Knight's coming up, hosting the fourth hour.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:56.980]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:57.040]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:57.240]  Personally,
[01:34:07.628 --> 01:34:14.432]  I thought that it was pretty anti-climactic what happened last night because there wasn't any gotcha moment with her.
[01:34:14.432 --> 01:34:26.959]  It was just every lie, every spun piece of garbage, every piece of disinfo, and then she had the lowest rating she's ever had, showing that people were totally sick of her.
[01:34:26.959 --> 01:34:27.900]  If you would have promoted
[01:34:29.548 --> 01:34:30.729]  I don't think so.
[01:34:45.899 --> 01:34:57.202]  But the big issue is obviously Russia and the fact that Obama created a total disaster in the Middle East along with NATO and the EU, turning over many, many nations to horrible jihadists.
[01:34:57.202 --> 01:34:59.342]  Syria has been fighting against it.
[01:34:59.342 --> 01:35:03.983]  And now our military has been defeating ISIS and mopping them up.
[01:35:03.983 --> 01:35:09.425]  So now more and more they're turning towards, it looks like removing Assad.
[01:35:10.422 --> 01:35:20.890]  And to try to trick Trump into that conflict, they have shot down an aircraft, they have blown up an armored column of armored vehicles, and this has been going on for months.
[01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:29.896]  There's been other incidents as well, and now Russia is saying, okay, well, we're entering war territory, so if any U.S.
[01:35:29.896 --> 01:35:34.740]  aircraft enter the airspace, or any other flying objects, cruise missiles, you name it, we're going to shoot them down.
[01:35:35.987 --> 01:35:41.953]  Because we let you blow up the chemical dump, we let you bomb the armored column, now you've shot down the airplane.
[01:35:41.953 --> 01:35:43.434]  This is clearly a test.
[01:35:43.434 --> 01:35:49.360]  I mean, if Trump wanted to do it, he'd tell the Russians, I'm coming in, back off, get ready, try to make some deal, or go ahead and do it.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:53.444]  He wouldn't be probing like this.
[01:35:53.444 --> 01:36:00.491]  And I've got it from White House sources, multiple sources, very high up, that Trump understands there's people trying to get him into a larger war, and he's been saying no.
[01:36:01.766 --> 01:36:07.231]  And that goes back to this article by Paul Watson on April 10th, the day after I talked to a high-level White House source.
[01:36:07.231 --> 01:36:13.636]  White House source, Trump pushes back against a neocon plan to invade Syria, troops massing as deep state plots regime change.
[01:36:13.636 --> 01:36:24.646]  Three days later, Bloomberg and others all reported word-for-word what we got from our source who talked to the President.
[01:36:24.646 --> 01:36:25.367]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:36:28.157 --> 01:36:32.019]  Again, you can see our story's April 10th, and then, look, Bloomberg, April 13th.
[01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:38.543]  This is what I wigged out about earlier, and a lot of that is pent-up anxiety about the interview yesterday and all the energy and things that are going on.
[01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:39.924]  That's not an act.
[01:36:39.924 --> 01:36:45.587]  When I occasionally, maybe once a month, freak out on air, and I've got to have a headline, it's not that I'm even mad at the crew.
[01:36:45.587 --> 01:36:52.331]  I started obsessing over it and wanting to remember it, and knowing I did the interview, and knowing I talked to the sources, and knowing we wrote the article,
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:37:00.046]  And then I'm just here, gibbering on air, asking for what I want, and there's so many thousands of articles, they can't find it.
[01:37:00.046 --> 01:37:02.848]  So, you know, say a prayer for the crew occasionally.
[01:37:02.848 --> 01:37:04.329]  Splitting up with me can be obnoxious.
[01:37:04.329 --> 01:37:11.356]  But seriously, Megyn Kelly asked me, are you an actor?
[01:37:11.356 --> 01:37:13.998]  Because in court documents, they said that you're playing an actor.
[01:37:15.612 --> 01:37:17.074]  Or something fake.
[01:37:17.074 --> 01:37:26.343]  I mean, I'm here giving you sources that the President said, no boots on the ground, we're taking ISIS out, we're not going to remove Assad.
[01:37:26.343 --> 01:37:29.006]  And then three days later, exactly what we said is in the news.
[01:37:29.006 --> 01:37:32.049]  That's not acting, that's real.
[01:37:32.049 --> 01:37:36.894]  Or when I get mad, and basically, I'm not obsessive compulsive about the
[01:37:37.978 --> 01:37:38.878]  I'm not that type of guy.
[01:37:38.878 --> 01:37:39.638]  I'm not a neat freak.
[01:37:39.638 --> 01:37:42.839]  But I have developed this frustration because I know all this knowledge and I know I'm right.
[01:37:42.839 --> 01:37:45.420]  And then when I can't find it or pull it right up, I go crazy.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:47.260]  Then what frustrates me on the other side is Megyn Kelly
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:13.484]  The biggest lie of the night was her saying that it wasn't a hit piece when we all knew it was.
[01:38:13.484 --> 01:38:18.147]  And then we showed you the tape, we played the audio, so you could see she was a liar.
[01:38:18.147 --> 01:38:19.928]  And then everything else that flowed from it was a lie.
[01:38:19.928 --> 01:38:25.592]  But the big factual lie wasn't just all the trick editing.
[01:38:25.592 --> 01:38:30.915]  It was her playing a clip of Joe Biggs, our full-time reporter at the time.
[01:38:30.915 --> 01:38:33.357]  He does reporting work for us now, but also does his own stuff.
[01:38:34.147 --> 01:38:35.712]  That's great.
[01:38:35.712 --> 01:38:37.055]  He's coming to the studio later.
[01:38:37.055 --> 01:38:38.339]  Down there with our camera people.
[01:38:40.168 --> 01:39:06.384]  Catching, this was Josh Owens and others, catching people with drugs coming across the border, and it's clearly marijuana, that's what they ship in the 55 pound containers, and they put it in the back of the vehicle and then run back across and they just smuggled something which is 99% drugs, probably marijuana, the police told us marijuana, FBI said marijuana, Biggs met with the FBI after this occasion and other occasions, they told him he had a lot of courage and our camera people had a lot of courage and we did a great job.
[01:39:07.978 --> 01:39:13.604]  And then we went into the most dangerous area over the Texas border and went and showed a known ISIS facility.
[01:39:13.604 --> 01:39:17.848]  It was later confirmed to be an ISIS facility by government documents your Judicial Watch got.
[01:39:17.848 --> 01:39:19.429]  And she just said, no, we're liars.
[01:39:19.429 --> 01:39:24.955]  So I want to play that clip and just illustrate that because Joe's coming into studio a little bit later.
[01:39:24.955 --> 01:39:28.318]  Here's a clip from Megyn Kelly last night.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:36.703]  Where she shows it and says this is an example of how we're not journalists because we said it was drugs and then Trump said it was drugs.
[01:39:36.703 --> 01:39:55.732]  Well that's like saying if a blue jay lands in the tree in my yard and I'm looking at it out the window and I take a picture of it and I put it on Facebook and say look I took a picture of a blue jay and then you know CNN does a story saying you're on an ornithologist you don't know that's a blue jay.
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:40:02.346]  No, if I see a red and silver 57 Chevy, I know a 57 Chevy.
[01:40:02.346 --> 01:40:07.973]  I don't have a degree, you know, in automotive history.
[01:40:07.973 --> 01:40:12.078]  But I know a 57 Chevy when I see one.
[01:40:12.078 --> 01:40:15.082]  And I can post a picture of it and I can say it's a 57 Chevy.
[01:40:15.082 --> 01:40:15.903]  You know, it's the same thing.
[01:40:17.028 --> 01:40:21.049]  We go down to the border, we get tipped off by the state police and border patrol where to go.
[01:40:21.049 --> 01:40:22.729]  We go show it to you.
[01:40:22.729 --> 01:40:26.110]  It's embarrassing for the government and Obama with the border open.
[01:40:26.110 --> 01:40:29.250]  It's now clamped down to a great extent by Trump.
[01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:29.831]  They're embarrassed.
[01:40:29.831 --> 01:40:31.031]  What do they do?
[01:40:31.031 --> 01:40:33.111]  They just say it's fake.
[01:40:33.111 --> 01:40:37.132]  They got clips of Comey saying Trump never tried to influence him, never called for obstruction.
[01:40:37.132 --> 01:40:38.852]  Just say it's obstruction.
[01:40:38.852 --> 01:40:40.553]  Just say the tape doesn't exist.
[01:40:40.553 --> 01:40:41.293]  Just say we're liars.
[01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:46.512]  And have the New York Times do it and try to use its credibility.
[01:40:46.512 --> 01:40:48.893]  It doesn't have credibility.
[01:40:48.893 --> 01:40:53.336]  NBC doesn't have credibility.
[01:40:53.336 --> 01:40:54.757]  CNN doesn't have credibility.
[01:40:54.757 --> 01:40:55.657]  You have zero.
[01:40:55.657 --> 01:40:56.818]  You have less than zero.
[01:40:56.818 --> 01:40:58.459]  You're known liars.
[01:40:58.459 --> 01:41:08.565]  Does it mean if you sandwich a pro-marijuana piece in with a piece about New Zealand and how beautiful it is, that by mixing some nebulous stuff in,
[01:41:10.216 --> 01:41:13.698]  Does it make the lie that it's sandwiched between seem okay?
[01:41:13.698 --> 01:41:15.559]  And the answer is no.
[01:41:15.559 --> 01:41:17.460]  Everything Megyn Kelly said was a lie.
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:22.102]  And I'm sick of Megyn Kelly, you're sick of Megyn Kelly, but we have to illustrate how they lie.
[01:41:22.102 --> 01:41:24.664]  We can't just go, oh, we know you're liars and move on.
[01:41:24.664 --> 01:41:34.709]  We've got to continue to show how they're liars and hammer it in because they're so close, ladies and gentlemen, to being completely discredited and collapsing.
[01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:36.270]  Here's the clip from Megyn Kelly last night.
[01:41:37.492 --> 01:41:40.073]  I mean, I know Trump watches and sees the clips and things.
[01:41:40.073 --> 01:41:42.574]  We did find indications of that.
[01:41:42.574 --> 01:41:52.759]  On July 22, 2015, InfoWars put up this video, claiming it showed drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico border, although we don't know what it actually shows.
[01:41:52.759 --> 01:41:59.403]  We actually witnessed a drug smuggling operation from Mexico into the U.S.
[01:41:59.403 --> 01:42:02.704]  Three days later, Mr. Trump gave this speech in Iowa.
[01:42:02.704 --> 01:42:03.064]  Big story.
[01:42:03.064 --> 01:42:03.945]  It's all over the place now.
[01:42:04.645 --> 01:42:14.747]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff, drugs, swimming across the river.
[01:42:14.747 --> 01:42:18.128]  And then she goes on to say, look how Trump just, you know, lied to you.
[01:42:18.128 --> 01:42:18.968]  I mean, no he didn't.
[01:42:18.968 --> 01:42:21.109]  That's one of the biggest drug corridors in the world.
[01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:26.110]  It's people illegally coming across with big cases of marijuana.
[01:42:26.110 --> 01:42:26.850]  That's how they ship it.
[01:42:28.459 --> 01:42:50.652]  You think people are going to risk their lives and risk going to prison, you know, just to smuggle bananas across or smuggle Easter bunnies across or Keebler elves or maybe it was Santa's elves and Santa now, months before Christmas, he flies over in a big plane and little, little elves jump out like paratroopers and then they drift down to earth and then they build the toys.
[01:42:51.618 --> 01:43:03.227]  You know, in the bushes by the Rio Grande, and then they come across, and then they get in a vehicle, they load the goods in the vehicle, then the elves run back into the bushes, and then the car speeds away.
[01:43:03.227 --> 01:43:04.928]  I mean, that was really what happened.
[01:43:04.928 --> 01:43:07.570]  That's a conspiracy theory!
[01:43:07.570 --> 01:43:15.475]  In a drug corridor, in the packaging we know the marijuana's packaged in, people clearly running across to put it in a vehicle, to be carried down the highway.
[01:43:15.475 --> 01:43:19.358]  I mean, you'd have to be a moron not to know what that was.
[01:43:19.358 --> 01:43:20.079]  But I'm digressing.
[01:43:22.048 --> 01:43:23.428]  I get frustrated by Megyn Kelly.
[01:43:23.428 --> 01:43:24.449]  I get frustrated by her lies.
[01:43:24.449 --> 01:43:25.569]  And I'm just sick of hearing it.
[01:43:25.569 --> 01:43:29.670]  I know most of you just tune out of it because you're tired of her.
[01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:35.091]  But we've got to continue to hammer these liars.
[01:43:35.091 --> 01:43:35.691]  800-259-9231.
[01:43:35.691 --> 01:43:36.692]  800-259-9231.
[01:43:36.692 --> 01:43:40.032]  On the Russia situation.
[01:43:40.032 --> 01:43:40.833]  On all of it.
[01:43:40.833 --> 01:43:44.753]  Speaking of Russia, Adam Schiff admits there's no proof of Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:43:44.753 --> 01:43:45.534]  He keeps saying this.
[01:43:45.534 --> 01:43:50.475]  He keeps saying this to CYA.
[01:43:50.475 --> 01:43:50.895]  But then...
[01:43:53.834 --> 01:43:54.955]  He's saying it doesn't matter.
[01:43:54.955 --> 01:43:58.397]  We have obstruction, so let's go into obstruction.
[01:43:58.397 --> 01:44:01.098]  I want to play a clip of Schiff.
[01:44:01.098 --> 01:44:05.321]  Adam Schiff admits there's no proof of Trump and Russia.
[01:44:05.321 --> 01:44:05.681]  Here it is.
[01:44:05.681 --> 01:44:12.605]  I know you can't talk about specific evidence, but he says Dianne Feinstein has said there's no evidence of collusion.
[01:44:12.605 --> 01:44:14.286]  So collusion between whom?
[01:44:14.286 --> 01:44:15.067]  Can you tell us that?
[01:44:16.912 --> 01:44:29.981]  Well, you know, the allegation, of course, is that the Russians in the hacking and dumping of documents in the election had essentially relationships with Trump campaign people and coordinated those efforts.
[01:44:29.981 --> 01:44:35.504]  Now, the FBI opened an investigation into that issue in July, well before Congress did.
[01:44:35.504 --> 01:44:37.526]  I think they did that for good reason in July.
[01:44:37.526 --> 01:44:39.727]  I think they maintained that investigation.
[01:44:39.727 --> 01:44:42.529]  It's ongoing for good reason as well.
[01:44:42.529 --> 01:44:46.752]  But I'm not prepared to say that there's proof you could take to a jury, but I can say
[01:44:46.972 --> 01:44:49.679]  There is enough that we ought to be investigating.
[01:44:49.679 --> 01:44:50.221]  Indeed it would be
[01:44:51.038 --> 01:44:58.404]  Yeah, like the uranium that Hillary and Podesta sold for 30-something million or her meeting with Putin in secret.
[01:44:58.404 --> 01:45:10.274]  This is all insane, but they just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to change the subject that they lost the election and that we were right about the polls being fake and we were right and we broke so much of the news.
[01:45:10.274 --> 01:45:19.922]  That's why they've got to have Dateline NBC with these hit pieces saying I'm not credible and I'm a fraud and all the rest of it is because they want to get to you.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.041]  They want to demoralize you.
[01:45:23.041 --> 01:45:25.143]  They want to make you feel hopeless.
[01:45:25.143 --> 01:45:31.066]  They want to make you think you're powerless instead of keeping your head up and realizing we've already had such huge victories.
[01:45:31.066 --> 01:45:34.088]  Thank God we've got a decent Supreme Court justice in.
[01:45:34.088 --> 01:45:48.918]  Thank heavens we've got some good things happening and some of the economy coming back and a 40 plus percent reduction of illegals coming across the border and NAFTA and GATT being renegotiated and the TPP being withdrawn from and the carbon tax of the Paris Accord we're out of and all
[01:45:49.318 --> 01:45:59.560]  The good things, that's why I'm so behind Trump, is because I know the globalists hate him, because they hate America, and he's trying the best he can.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:05.642]  Trump told my sources that he wasn't going to let them launch a wider war, but they were trying to, and they're still trying.
[01:46:05.642 --> 01:46:09.542]  But he's doing good with our military, taking out ISIS.
[01:46:09.542 --> 01:46:11.703]  This is a very exciting time to be alive.
[01:46:11.703 --> 01:46:13.083]  The globalists are panicking.
[01:46:13.083 --> 01:46:16.364]  Briefly, and then I'm going to John and Zach and Dave and Frank and Al and others,
[01:46:18.815 --> 01:46:24.557]  I want to hire, and we're hiring some more producers and other folks to run live shows.
[01:46:24.557 --> 01:46:27.218]  We've got an amazing new lady we've hired.
[01:46:27.218 --> 01:46:46.645]  I'm trying to hire another 10 or 15 people just to run all these shows I want to launch in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night, so there's other hosts, and other guests, and more callers, and more time to really continue to affect the news cycle on Twitter, Facebook, and Google, because the stories we're putting out, and our reports, and our analysis
[01:46:48.334 --> 01:47:07.107]  is really having a big effect and I want to go to the next level in the face of their onslaught but that takes your financial support, it takes your prayers, and it takes you spreading the articles and videos at InfoWars.com to everybody you know continually and not just saying, hey I already know all this, you know, I'm glad Alex is there, I'm glad other people are there.
[01:47:07.107 --> 01:47:08.508]  We've got to continue to hammer
[01:47:09.844 --> 01:47:10.384]  The Globalist.
[01:47:28.146 --> 01:47:33.670]  More and more just specials on our already discounted high-quality products at InfoWareStore.com.

[01:48:12.898 --> 01:48:14.038]  It's drop shipped from them.
[01:48:14.038 --> 01:48:15.058]  It's fresh.
[01:48:15.058 --> 01:48:19.420]  Last 25 years, the very best out there for this metric, for this price.

[01:48:24.361 --> 01:48:27.182]  It's high quality, the very low price.
[01:48:27.182 --> 01:48:28.022]  Emrix Essentials.
[01:48:29.497 --> 01:48:37.599]  Outdoor Pack, that's 40% off retail, and that's the super high quality non-nano zinc sunscreen, super concentrated.

[01:48:44.761 --> 01:48:45.701]  They both work great.
[01:48:45.701 --> 01:48:49.262]  That's together because I want you to be introduced to that this summer.
[01:48:49.262 --> 01:48:51.043]  Living Defense is 20% off.
[01:48:51.043 --> 01:48:51.563]  That's the great
[01:48:52.623 --> 01:48:59.446]  It's a big old bottle, big old caplets of powdered key herbs and other compounds that knock out parasites.
[01:48:59.446 --> 01:49:03.147]  Everybody loves this, but just the herbs alone in it make people feel good.
[01:49:03.147 --> 01:49:04.188]  That's the reports we've gotten.
[01:49:04.188 --> 01:49:11.991]  Read all the different reports that are there, all the different five-star reviews at infowarslife.com or AAA253-3139.

[01:49:14.072 --> 01:49:17.353]  Living Defense is about to sell out, but we're scheduled to get more in in about a month.
[01:49:18.612 --> 01:49:20.874]  It's normally $44.
[01:49:20.874 --> 01:49:27.841]  It is $27.96, and it cost us a lot to manufacture this, so that's the savings of $16.
[01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:30.184]  This is, I think, one of the most impressive underrated.
[01:49:30.184 --> 01:49:35.769]  I mean, it's got 4.7 stars and hundreds and hundreds of reviews, but it's still underrated.
[01:49:35.769 --> 01:49:41.375]  Living Defense is just amazing for yourself, your family.

[01:50:37.416 --> 01:50:40.720]  We've got the Super Blue high-quality fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.743]  It's made by the same folks that make Toms of Maine, but we have the iodine and colloidal silver.
[01:50:44.743 --> 01:50:45.344]  It's amazing.
[01:50:45.344 --> 01:50:46.805]  It's super concentrated.
[01:50:46.805 --> 01:50:47.726]  That's back in stock.
[01:50:47.726 --> 01:50:49.928]  4.8 review.
[01:50:49.928 --> 01:50:51.470]  1,500 plus reviews.
[01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:52.671]  Again, thank you all for your support.

[01:51:00.669 --> 01:51:05.133]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:51:05.133 --> 01:51:06.734]  Those times may be near.
[01:51:06.734 --> 01:51:07.635]  Think about it.
[01:51:07.635 --> 01:51:12.258]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:51:12.258 --> 01:51:16.882]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:17.242 --> 01:51:23.048]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:23.048 --> 01:51:29.754]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:29.754 --> 01:51:32.297]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:51:32.737 --> 01:51:35.538]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:02.970]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:52:02.970 --> 01:52:06.691]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:52:06.691 --> 01:52:07.791]  Forget bunkers.
[01:52:07.791 --> 01:52:09.612]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:52:09.612 --> 01:52:11.312]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:52:59.582 --> 01:53:02.424]  Many books have been written regarding the Law of Attraction.
[01:53:02.424 --> 01:53:08.927]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?

[01:53:56.343 --> 01:53:57.945]  Shelter when you need it most.
[01:54:10.413 --> 01:54:17.997]  You know, folks, just because we haven't had a nuclear war since the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, doesn't mean it's not going to happen.
[01:54:17.997 --> 01:54:34.366]  In fact, most historians, most military analysts believe the longer we go still having the weapons on ships, on airplanes, in submarines, in silos, the longer this continues, the more there's a chance we're going to end up having something go wrong.
[01:54:34.366 --> 01:54:37.288]  And I say that particularly not just because of accidents.
[01:54:39.557 --> 01:54:42.639]  But because people stop worrying about them.
[01:54:42.639 --> 01:54:48.322]  They start taking it for granted that we're always going to have peace and we won't destroy ourselves.
[01:54:48.322 --> 01:54:54.125]  And then the Pentagon starts thinking, maybe we can use nukes in limited strikes.
[01:54:54.125 --> 01:54:55.686]  So we have to respect these weapons.
[01:54:55.686 --> 01:55:00.189]  We have to respect the bioweapons and the chemical weapons and all the things that are happening.
[01:55:01.226 --> 01:55:05.188]  Because Russia's saying, you fly an airplane over Syria's space, we're going to shoot it down.
[01:55:05.188 --> 01:55:06.508]  That means they intend to do it.
[01:55:06.508 --> 01:55:16.293]  And then if we retaliate, then the Russians retaliate, and within a matter of an hour, most analysts believe it could lead to tactical nuclear weapons being used.
[01:55:16.293 --> 01:55:17.954]  And again, Trump isn't trying to do this.
[01:55:17.954 --> 01:55:19.154]  He's been very clear.
[01:55:19.154 --> 01:55:23.176]  But there are people inside the deep state that are undermining him at every level.
[01:55:23.176 --> 01:55:27.458]  Not just the State Department, not just the CIA, but in the military.
[01:55:27.458 --> 01:55:29.959]  John in Texas, what do you think about what's happening?
[01:55:32.765 --> 01:55:33.205]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:33.205 --> 01:55:36.547]  First off, before I start, I want to recommend a great movie.
[01:55:36.547 --> 01:55:37.308]  It just came out.
[01:55:37.308 --> 01:55:39.689]  I've seen it at the movies called Bitter Harvest.
[01:55:39.689 --> 01:55:41.850]  I don't know if you've heard of it or not.
[01:55:41.850 --> 01:55:42.330]  No, I haven't.
[01:55:42.330 --> 01:55:43.691]  What's it about?
[01:55:43.691 --> 01:55:51.415]  It's about the Ukrainian massacre, the communist massacres of the Ukrainians during the 1930s.
[01:55:51.415 --> 01:55:52.356]  Really great movie, really.
[01:55:53.306 --> 01:55:56.927]  You know, not too many Hollywood movies I'd ever recommend, but that bad.
[01:55:56.927 --> 01:56:10.271]  You know, folks have complained that they hadn't done an Armenian massacre or Ukrainian extermination movies, and so I'm glad that the one about the folks in Turkey came out, and so I've heard about Bitter Harvest.
[01:56:10.271 --> 01:56:13.592]  I need to see that.
[01:56:13.592 --> 01:56:14.012]  Walmart.
[01:56:14.012 --> 01:56:17.053]  They're in Walmart right now, so you can pick a copy up there.
[01:56:17.053 --> 01:56:18.574]  Great movie.
[01:56:18.574 --> 01:56:22.015]  Okay, what I want to talk about is a couple weeks ago I was
[01:56:23.368 --> 01:56:26.631]  Going through some of the militia websites, you know?
[01:56:26.631 --> 01:56:42.142]  And they said that, uh, what I got out of reading them is that they said they were trying to form a new Continental Army, and that when the Deep State starts their war with Russia, that they plan on asking Vladimir Putin for air cover and heavy weapons, and then they'll march on Warsaw.
[01:56:42.142 --> 01:56:49.288]  Oh, that is total, I guarantee you that's feds, in there so they can create that narrative later, and claim any American resistance is directed by the Russians.
[01:56:52.367 --> 01:56:54.328]  I hope so.
[01:56:54.328 --> 01:56:57.349]  I mean, that's central scripting.
[01:56:57.349 --> 01:57:00.090]  The Russians can't even run their own country.
[01:57:00.090 --> 01:57:02.291]  They're not going to be coordinating anything here.
[01:57:02.291 --> 01:57:13.355]  It's the left that came out in FBI documents that wanted to invite the Cubans and a bunch of Latin American communist states in, and then Chinese on the West Coast.
[01:57:13.355 --> 01:57:16.336]  And that still is tenuous and somewhat delusional.
[01:57:16.336 --> 01:57:17.617]  But the idea that Russians
[01:57:19.005 --> 01:57:24.869]  I'm not against the militias.
[01:57:24.869 --> 01:57:30.852]  The feds inside the militias always misrepresent what I say and go, he's anti-militia, man!
[01:57:30.852 --> 01:57:34.054]  Then the guy goes in and gets his orders from the FBI.
[01:57:34.054 --> 01:57:40.238]  They'll have people go out, create militias, have them do unconstitutional things so they can then demonize the idea of an armed citizenry.
[01:57:40.238 --> 01:57:42.119]  They've had a project since the 80s.
[01:57:42.119 --> 01:57:43.280]  That's what it is.
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.661]  I don't know about the group you're talking about particularly.
[01:57:45.661 --> 01:57:46.181]  I just know
[01:57:47.341 --> 01:57:56.368]  The idea of asking Putin to come over here with air cover is A. ridiculous and B. meant to demonize any resistance movement.
[01:57:56.368 --> 01:58:02.973]  If this goes to a hot war, they're going to claim that they're Russian agents.
[01:58:02.973 --> 01:58:04.774]  I got another quick question for you.
[01:58:04.774 --> 01:58:06.476]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:58:06.476 --> 01:58:06.736]  Okay.
[01:58:06.736 --> 01:58:14.342]  Donald Trump's a strong supporter of Israel, is friends with Benjamin Netanyahu, and has done a lot of Jewish.
[01:58:15.131 --> 01:58:21.527]  Why are so many Jews in Hollywood and in the media and in, uh, they're trying to bring them down?
[01:58:21.527 --> 01:58:23.372]  Because they're leftist.
[01:58:24.474 --> 01:58:36.283]  And that's where leftists are unified, no matter where they come from, whether they're communist, Chinese, or Jewish, or whatever, is that they hate Christianity, they hate freedom, and they want to have a socialized command and control system.
[01:58:36.283 --> 01:58:38.905]  Just like left-wing Jews want to kill the right-wing Jews.
[01:58:38.905 --> 01:58:39.766]  And it's the same thing.
[01:58:39.766 --> 01:58:43.388]  It's all a left-wing, right-wing issue, which itself is a controlled paradigm.
[01:58:43.388 --> 01:58:45.550]  But those are really good questions, John.
[01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:46.831]  I appreciate your call.
[01:58:46.831 --> 01:58:50.314]  You know, we should talk about what a civil war will look like, because they may have one.
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:56.125]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[01:58:56.125 --> 01:59:00.570]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.
[01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:11.182]  InfoWars Life has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[01:59:11.782 --> 01:59:19.747]  The Prostagard formula does just that, with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[01:59:19.747 --> 01:59:29.113]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, and copper.
[01:59:29.113 --> 01:59:39.379]  Prostagard is something that the men on the InfoWars crew take every day, and from our research, it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.
[01:59:39.859 --> 01:59:40.380]  We're good to go.
[02:00:11.582 --> 02:00:25.230]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:32.134]  If you just joined us, a caller called in and talked about going around on militia websites.
[02:00:32.134 --> 02:00:38.258]  You know, I could start a website and claim that I was a Chinese jet pilot from Pluto.
[02:00:39.704 --> 02:00:42.585]  Or I can start a website and claim that I was militia this, militia that.
[02:00:42.585 --> 02:00:43.746]  I believe in the militia.
[02:00:43.746 --> 02:00:44.747]  It's in the Second Amendment.
[02:00:44.747 --> 02:00:56.112]  It's an armed citizenry called out by your local government or your local leadership if the country is invaded or if the federal government falls to an outside hostile force.
[02:00:56.112 --> 02:01:00.194]  And you've got the states and counties and cities organizing against globalism right now.
[02:01:00.194 --> 02:01:01.935]  You've got countries organizing against it.
[02:01:01.935 --> 02:01:03.156]  And our movement is popular.
[02:01:04.397 --> 02:01:11.020]  The globalists are going to try to brand it as extreme, racist, or basically outsider.
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:20.125]  It's been the left, historically, wanting to bring down the country and then bring in a multinational force from communist and socialist nations to suppress us.
[02:01:20.125 --> 02:01:28.429]  Loretta Lynch tried to do that just about a year ago with the Strong Cities Initiative to bring in the UN to actually have them oversee the police.
[02:01:28.429 --> 02:01:31.030]  So they're trying to cause a civil war, civil unrest.
[02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:32.831]  Then if things break down and get really bad,
[02:01:34.175 --> 02:01:38.620]  They have now said in Atlantic Monthly, they're going to overthrow Trump, claiming he's a Russian agent.
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:44.687]  Then all of the new Republicans that are elected, they'll claim were elected by Russian influence as well.
[02:01:44.687 --> 02:01:48.491]  If they go along with the purge, maybe they can stay in office.
[02:01:48.491 --> 02:01:51.735]  The Democrats will then have new elections run by Homeland Security.
[02:01:51.735 --> 02:01:53.237]  We'll never have another real election again.
[02:01:54.056 --> 02:01:58.659]  They will then claim everyone resisting this takeover is a Russian agent.
[02:01:58.659 --> 02:02:03.883]  So, of course, they're going to have the websites and the groups and the organizations.
[02:02:03.883 --> 02:02:04.984]  That's a false flag.
[02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:09.947]  Just like Trump knew when the Jewish centers were being attacked, he said it's probably a false flag.
[02:02:09.947 --> 02:02:12.149]  Turned out it was a false flag.
[02:02:12.149 --> 02:02:23.257]  Because 99%, I mean, every once in a while you see a real racial attack or a cross burning or somebody painting swastikas in a dorm, but 99% of the time it's somebody wanting attention.
[02:02:24.073 --> 02:02:31.242]  Most of the time you hear the story of, you know, a white woman, four black guys raped her behind the 7-Eleven and then it turns out that's fake too.
[02:02:31.242 --> 02:02:34.286]  A lot of this stuff is done to get attention.
[02:02:34.286 --> 02:02:35.127]  And the police know that.
[02:02:38.607 --> 02:02:39.167]  Strangest things.
[02:02:39.167 --> 02:02:43.068]  A lot of times they find pipe bombs in towns and then it's usually a cop or a firefighter.
[02:02:43.068 --> 02:02:53.191]  And I'm not saying cops and firefighters on average are doing that, it's just psychologically there's that very low percentile that still is the majority of the actual events that are normally rare.
[02:02:53.191 --> 02:02:55.512]  That's just criminology.
[02:02:55.512 --> 02:03:00.874]  And so, without even seeing these sites, I had already envisioned, and then I saw the preparation and I've seen them announce it,
[02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:06.324]  Now you could argue they're listening to me in government, going, oh that's a great plan, let's do it, but that's not what they're doing.
[02:03:06.324 --> 02:03:20.156]  I've studied history, I know who their tacticians are, I know their plans, and as that's what I've said, they're going to try to kill the president, overthrow the president, whatever they can, cause a civil war, be violent, blame it on us, and then claim if we resist them, we're with Putin.
[02:03:22.987 --> 02:03:26.749]  And so yes, of course, that's what we've been hearing.
[02:03:26.749 --> 02:03:29.911]  That if there's a civil war, there'll be Russian air cover.
[02:03:29.911 --> 02:03:32.452]  That's not how the military works to begin with.
[02:03:32.452 --> 02:03:46.560]  It's whoever gets control of the National Security Council, and the launch codes, and the nuclear weapons, and then whoever gives orders to the submarines and ships, and do they follow those orders?
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.502]  It's not like we're in a civil war and the Russians come over and help us and all this stuff.
[02:03:52.022 --> 02:04:10.674]  It's whoever's got control of space command and the weapons platforms in space, not just satellites, but whole platforms up there with sabot meteor guns, with DU projectiles, and hydrogen bombs, and neutron bombs, and just, and by the way, I think it's insane they put all this up in orbit.
[02:04:10.674 --> 02:04:13.496]  But we're like 30 years ahead of everybody else.
[02:04:13.496 --> 02:04:15.417]  And it's just, it's all up there.
[02:04:15.417 --> 02:04:16.758]  They assemble them in pieces.
[02:04:16.758 --> 02:04:17.999]  They claim that's how it's safer.
[02:04:17.999 --> 02:04:21.301]  They send them up in pieces, then they assemble them up there.
[02:04:23.055 --> 02:04:25.817]  And it's just completely insane.
[02:04:25.817 --> 02:04:27.038]  It's a miracle we're even alive.
[02:04:27.038 --> 02:04:31.361]  You know, I'm thinking about not being political anymore, just because I've already done that so much.
[02:04:31.361 --> 02:04:42.969]  And just covering genetic engineering, electromagnetic stuff, the chimeras, you know, just all the weapon systems and just how most people I talk to don't even talk, they just look at their phone all day.
[02:04:42.969 --> 02:04:45.491]  Hell, most talk show hosts can't even host shows anymore.
[02:04:45.491 --> 02:04:48.193]  They just sit there and look at their phones and just, I mean, I'm not being this meanly, but
[02:04:49.755 --> 02:04:54.219]  A lot of people I know personally can't even host a talk show because they just can't even stay off their phones.
[02:04:54.219 --> 02:04:55.259]  They all have family members now.
[02:04:55.259 --> 02:04:56.000]  They're just gone.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.381]  They just, face sucker, boom.
[02:05:01.198 --> 02:05:05.500]  Lost in the constant fake news cycle, we have forgotten the building tensions in Syria.
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:10.803]  Until this morning, when news broke of a Syrian Army plane being shot down by a United States F-18.
[02:05:10.803 --> 02:05:15.505]  This is the first Syrian aircraft to have been downed by the United States since 2011.
[02:05:15.505 --> 02:05:22.949]  Washington justified the strike, claiming the jet dropped bombs near U.S.-backed forces, while officials from Damascus said they were attacking ISIS.
[02:05:22.949 --> 02:05:25.671]  Truth be told, these are most likely the same group.
[02:05:25.671 --> 02:05:28.512]  But we should be asking John McCain that question.
[02:05:28.672 --> 02:05:31.374]  Russia has responded by saying it will now treat U.S.
[02:05:31.374 --> 02:05:34.117]  aircraft operating in Syria as targets.
[02:05:34.117 --> 02:05:39.761]  President Trump can't get a microphone loud enough to ask for the Russia collusion investigation to be over.
[02:05:39.761 --> 02:05:43.765]  But don't hold your breath on the Democrats finding common sense and logic overnight.
[02:05:43.765 --> 02:05:46.487]  President Trump will still be investigated for collusion with Russia.
[02:05:46.707 --> 02:05:49.008]  While they are threatening him and our country.
[02:05:49.008 --> 02:05:56.393]  President Trump, the globalists are trying to trap you and trick you into a war in Syria in hopes it will cost you the 2020 election.
[02:05:56.393 --> 02:05:57.233]  Don't fall for it.
[02:05:57.233 --> 02:05:58.634]  Make America great again.
[02:05:58.634 --> 02:06:00.895]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:06:00.895 --> 02:06:06.298]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:06.298 --> 02:06:09.140]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:11.121]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:06:11.121 --> 02:06:15.984]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:06:16.144 --> 02:06:18.226]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:06:18.226 --> 02:06:19.527]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:06:19.527 --> 02:06:24.631]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:24.631 --> 02:06:31.376]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:31.516 --> 02:06:34.437]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:34.437 --> 02:06:38.198]  It's loaded with good halogen iodides and the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:38.198 --> 02:06:45.099]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:45.099 --> 02:06:52.621]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[02:07:50.962 --> 02:07:51.763]  10% off on auto ship.

[02:08:21.941 --> 02:08:29.729]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.729 --> 02:08:35.715]  Alright, I'm going right to Zach, Dave, Frank, Al and others and then Joe Biggs is scheduled to be here.
[02:08:35.715 --> 02:08:38.898]  Megyn Kelly attacked him and said it was totally fake.
[02:08:38.898 --> 02:08:40.739]  You know, we didn't catch drugs coming across the border.
[02:08:42.338 --> 02:08:45.541]  It's just emblematic of her whole piece, what a fraud she is.
[02:08:45.541 --> 02:08:57.510]  But now they've got the Washington Post and others, after saying they didn't want the interview to air, that didn't even matter, and use that as a backdrop to demonize me and say I was the most evil person in the world.
[02:08:57.510 --> 02:09:02.614]  Now their new thing is, Megyn Kelly just helped some guy get thousands of new followers.
[02:09:02.614 --> 02:09:03.835]  Oh, she helped me.
[02:09:03.835 --> 02:09:06.137]  Yeah, MSM, you're the power structure.
[02:09:07.932 --> 02:09:09.653]  She's the princess, I'm the toad.
[02:09:09.653 --> 02:09:11.733]  They can't even create their own analogy.
[02:09:11.733 --> 02:09:13.074]  That's mine.
[02:09:13.074 --> 02:09:16.455]  I made fun of myself.
[02:09:16.455 --> 02:09:20.716]  And then meanwhile, they show how we got boosted traffic.
[02:09:20.716 --> 02:09:22.676]  Well, yeah, this is usually a slow time of the year.
[02:09:22.676 --> 02:09:26.257]  And we got a lot more traffic.
[02:09:26.257 --> 02:09:27.458]  That's what I told everybody.
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:30.202]  This is usually one of the slowest times of the year.
[02:09:30.202 --> 02:09:34.708]  This and the first two weeks of August is the slowest time of the year.
[02:09:34.708 --> 02:09:40.354]  People are going on summer vacation, the summer is really kicking in, or people are going back to school.
[02:09:40.354 --> 02:09:46.561]  But no, I told everybody, I didn't show you the analytics, I said we've got the highest ratings we've had since the election.
[02:09:47.486 --> 02:09:49.347]  But it wasn't from her show.
[02:09:49.347 --> 02:09:56.571]  It was from them making a huge controversy to try to get her viewers for flagging NBC.
[02:09:56.571 --> 02:09:58.973]  She came in and had six million.
[02:09:58.973 --> 02:10:00.374]  Six and a half million.
[02:10:00.374 --> 02:10:01.854]  Then she had five million.
[02:10:01.854 --> 02:10:04.136]  And now she has 3.5 million.
[02:10:04.136 --> 02:10:05.757]  Now, part of that is the summer.
[02:10:07.210 --> 02:10:13.551]  But I looked it up, a decade ago they had like 15 million viewers for an average day on NBC.
[02:10:13.551 --> 02:10:15.732]  They're tuning out of you.
[02:10:15.732 --> 02:10:18.812]  I don't need you, Megan.
[02:10:18.812 --> 02:10:25.733]  Our videos in the last week about you had 20 plus million views.
[02:10:25.733 --> 02:10:29.434]  Ours had over 15 million, Cernovich's had a bunch, 22 million.
[02:10:29.434 --> 02:10:31.674]  That's just counting a few activist videos.
[02:10:31.674 --> 02:10:32.575]  I don't have a lot of time.
[02:10:32.575 --> 02:10:34.455]  I went and got on YouTube, counted them up.
[02:10:35.848 --> 02:10:37.069]  This morning.
[02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:39.771]  Saw Cernovich's yesterday because I wanted to see how ours compared.
[02:10:39.771 --> 02:10:43.074]  He had like 8, 9 million.
[02:10:43.074 --> 02:10:44.175]  We had 15 million.
[02:10:44.175 --> 02:10:44.555]  Do the math.
[02:10:44.555 --> 02:10:45.016]  That's 20.
[02:10:45.016 --> 02:10:45.756]  I said 22 million.
[02:10:45.756 --> 02:10:46.657]  That's 24 million, 25 million.
[02:10:46.657 --> 02:10:50.560]  So it didn't matter what they did.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:51.481]  She's a joke.
[02:10:51.481 --> 02:10:52.882]  That's the story.
[02:10:52.882 --> 02:10:56.825]  And now they've got articles saying, don't say my name.
[02:10:56.825 --> 02:11:00.809]  MSM has been not saying my name as a rule until about three years ago.
[02:11:04.355 --> 02:11:07.757]  And now they're back to saying we will not say his name.
[02:11:07.757 --> 02:11:10.419]  A little too late there, guys.
[02:11:10.419 --> 02:11:14.121]  Little, little too late.
[02:11:14.121 --> 02:11:18.444]  There's the headline, Megyn Kelly just helped some guy get thousands of new followers.
[02:11:18.444 --> 02:11:20.525]  Megyn Kelly just helped some guy.
[02:11:20.525 --> 02:11:23.627]  NBC News host Megyn Kelly boosted the social media profile.
[02:11:23.627 --> 02:11:25.168]  Well, I've never been good on social media.
[02:11:25.168 --> 02:11:31.652]  We have our own syndicated system, our own network, but, I mean, we reach millions there, but
[02:11:33.177 --> 02:11:34.618]  I just don't get it.
[02:11:34.618 --> 02:11:42.822]  NBC's new host, news host, fake news host Megyn Kelly boosted the social media profile of a person when she aired the interview of him on her show Sunday night.
[02:11:42.822 --> 02:11:44.283]  But I love the paradox.
[02:11:44.283 --> 02:11:48.125]  They cannot even say my name and folks know who they're talking about.
[02:11:48.125 --> 02:11:49.846]  So it's really a joke on them.
[02:11:49.846 --> 02:11:57.591]  And of course, does anybody even want to know the name of the guy that wrote this story?
[02:11:57.591 --> 02:12:00.412]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, a total joke.
[02:12:00.412 --> 02:12:01.593]  Okay, who's been holding the longest here?
[02:12:02.694 --> 02:12:04.956]  Let's go ahead to Zach, and then Dave, and then Frank, and then Al.
[02:12:04.956 --> 02:12:07.578]  Zach, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:12:07.578 --> 02:12:09.319]  Alex, thanks for having me.
[02:12:09.319 --> 02:12:13.763]  It's good to be back on, and I just wanted to connect some dots from a military intelligence perspective.
[02:12:13.763 --> 02:12:15.384]  So, greetings from CENTCOM.
[02:12:15.384 --> 02:12:18.667]  They hate to hear that over the airwaves, but we're, you know, we're gonna do what we gotta do.
[02:12:18.667 --> 02:12:27.574]  So, this whole Russia thing, I don't think you know how critical your role is in this, because it is critical, but I don't know if you saw the Oliver Stone 4P series on Putin?
[02:12:27.574 --> 02:12:28.294]  I didn't have a chance.
[02:12:28.294 --> 02:12:28.955]  I hear it's excellent.
[02:12:30.006 --> 02:12:37.752]  Okay, so this, the Oliver Stone piece came out just after Megyn Kelly's debacle with him, where she, she basically, I mean, she looks like an idiot talking to him.
[02:12:37.752 --> 02:12:38.913]  He talks her down.
[02:12:38.913 --> 02:12:45.758]  Then they put, Oliver Stone puts out his piece where he looks completely credible, completely breaking down Syria, completely breaking down everything.
[02:12:45.758 --> 02:12:48.260]  Then they panic, push your interview.
[02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:49.701]  Not to mention, they panic.
[02:12:49.701 --> 02:12:53.864]  They hear Russian and Putin's view on North Korea, which is a problem for them.
[02:12:53.864 --> 02:12:59.749]  So not only do they push your interview, demonize you, tie Trump to you, they knock down a plane in a sovereign country.
[02:13:00.464 --> 02:13:05.227]  To push Trump to a point where he has to go to blows with Russia, because they are done.
[02:13:05.227 --> 02:13:08.290]  Bezos and the Apple CEO are going to the White House soon.
[02:13:08.290 --> 02:13:10.651]  They got Kushner in the Middle East now.
[02:13:10.651 --> 02:13:11.992]  They've picked their sides.
[02:13:11.992 --> 02:13:13.734]  And you are critical in this.
[02:13:13.734 --> 02:13:17.716]  They can't stand it, but nobody cares in the intelligence agencies.
[02:13:17.716 --> 02:13:19.858]  The three-letter agencies are incompetent.
[02:13:19.858 --> 02:13:23.280]  The only three-letter agencies that really matter nowadays are WWW.
[02:13:24.665 --> 02:13:26.906]  And that's followed by whatever website you want to go to for real news.
[02:13:26.906 --> 02:13:28.806]  Because that's the intel.
[02:13:28.806 --> 02:13:30.687]  That's what the intel community is listening to.
[02:13:30.687 --> 02:13:32.407]  That's what they're operating under.
[02:13:32.407 --> 02:13:33.468]  And we're in this thing.
[02:13:33.468 --> 02:13:35.648]  There is a quickening going on.
[02:13:35.648 --> 02:13:39.149]  Now, they can't stand that they got guys like me, and you on the phone.
[02:13:39.149 --> 02:13:43.531]  Guys like Tim Kennedy, who are on the ground right now, and I can't get into that, getting on your show.
[02:13:43.531 --> 02:13:43.811]  Okay?
[02:13:43.811 --> 02:13:45.131]  But this is real.
[02:13:45.131 --> 02:13:51.633]  We swore an oath to the Constitution, and we are liable under the United States Code of Military Justice to protect and uphold the Constitution.
[02:13:51.633 --> 02:13:54.394]  So I don't know what they think they're pulling, but they are desperate.
[02:13:55.251 --> 02:13:56.972]  I got a couple more points, but you go ahead and elaborate.
[02:13:56.972 --> 02:14:04.778]  No, and you've called before and given us really, really great information, and most people I know that are in government agencies are, like you said, they're totally upset about what's happening.
[02:14:04.778 --> 02:14:06.700]  They know we've sided with radical Islam.
[02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:09.021]  They know that the globalists are trying to sell the country out.
[02:14:09.021 --> 02:14:14.686]  They know Hollywood basically runs the top of the government and just wants to wreck the country in some pissing contest.
[02:14:14.686 --> 02:14:17.688]  And so it's just basic sanity is prevailing.
[02:14:17.688 --> 02:14:24.373]  And then Trump wants to knock out ISIS and clean up the problem, but others inside want a wider war to knock out Assad.
[02:14:24.853 --> 02:14:32.037]  So the Russians have let Trump or his own people hit the chemical dump, blow up the convoy, shoot down the plane.
[02:14:32.037 --> 02:14:33.718]  Now they're saying no.
[02:14:33.718 --> 02:14:37.200]  I'm worried that, you know, Trump obviously isn't calling the shots on that.
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.823]  Somebody else in deep state is going to send in an aircraft, launch a missile.
[02:14:40.823 --> 02:14:42.423]  The Russians are going to shoot it down.
[02:14:42.423 --> 02:14:48.087]  They're going to go wake Trump up at two in the morning and say, sir, the Russians just shot a missile down or they just shot down our plane.
[02:14:48.087 --> 02:14:49.268]  And then we're off to the races.
[02:14:49.268 --> 02:14:50.588]  I mean, this is insanity.
[02:14:50.588 --> 02:14:53.070]  If Russia was on our borders or flooding us with jihadis,
[02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:55.291]  Or in our business, that'd be one thing.
[02:14:55.291 --> 02:15:05.096]  But I'm sorry, Russia's not in our business, but you've got this rogue state, this rogue deep state, up there trying to overthrow Trump and trying to box him in now.
[02:15:05.096 --> 02:15:07.977]  What's the info you've got and where do you see all this going?
[02:15:09.264 --> 02:15:14.007]  So basically, the media completely overstretched their bounds here.
[02:15:14.007 --> 02:15:18.711]  They were completely put off guard by Trump, which stopped the kinetic momentum that has built within the military.
[02:15:18.711 --> 02:15:25.756]  Because you have to understand, a lot of these generals have been there for two, three decades, so presidents are interchangeable, as Putin elaborated in his sit-down with Oliver Stone.
[02:15:25.756 --> 02:15:28.098]  However, what they're doing is using the media.
[02:15:28.098 --> 02:15:32.641]  They're using the media as 37 series of United States military psychological operations.
[02:15:33.201 --> 02:15:33.842]  We're good to go.
[02:15:53.095 --> 02:15:58.201]  But make no mistake, Russia is the only government in Syria that has been invited.
[02:15:58.201 --> 02:16:00.363]  I understand ISIS isn't there, I understand what's going on.
[02:16:00.363 --> 02:16:05.268]  That is a sovereign country, and the only government that has been invited there is the Russians.
[02:16:05.268 --> 02:16:06.950]  And that's what Vladimir Putin talked about a week ago.
[02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:08.392]  So it's no coincidence
[02:16:09.384 --> 02:16:18.446]  That they pushed your interview up, tied you to Trump, and shot down a plane in seemingly real time to create this fasco, because they are freaking out.
[02:16:18.446 --> 02:16:26.168]  They do not have a psychological... Well I know this, when I've covered Bilderberg, the first time this ever happened, it was when I was covering Bilderberg like 10 years ago in person.
[02:16:26.168 --> 02:16:36.911]  My cell phone didn't work well, it was dropping cell, it was dropping bars, it was losing its power like 10 times faster, getting real hot in my pocket.
[02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:37.791]  It happened to everybody.
[02:16:38.251 --> 02:16:42.474]  Then I even had guys pop in sometimes and make threats and things and laugh at us.
[02:16:42.474 --> 02:16:52.460]  And then one time I was in the hotel before they shut it down in Chantilly and went into a back room where they were all in a conference room listening to the phones and stuff in live time, a bunch of different agencies.
[02:16:53.342 --> 02:16:55.423]  Well, I kind of sat there and listened to him talking.
[02:16:55.423 --> 02:16:57.444]  Well, that's this Navy satellite.
[02:16:57.444 --> 02:17:00.385]  You've got to use that Air Force satellite to track that one.
[02:17:00.385 --> 02:17:02.806]  That's how we pick up those feeds on those phones.
[02:17:02.806 --> 02:17:04.006]  And then I'm like, hi guys!
[02:17:04.006 --> 02:17:05.867]  And they all completely freaked out.
[02:17:05.867 --> 02:17:12.510]  But the point is, it's been a while since in live time they're jacked into my phone using it as an audio device.
[02:17:12.510 --> 02:17:13.910]  It happened to the engineers.
[02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:16.331]  It happened to a bunch of the writers in the last week.
[02:17:16.331 --> 02:17:21.994]  So then I realized, oh my gosh, this Megyn Kelly thing is part of a larger PSYOP
[02:17:23.075 --> 02:17:25.320]  Again, to discredit Trump, but it didn't work.
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:28.306]  It had record low viewers.
[02:17:28.306 --> 02:17:29.148]  Not only did it not work...
[02:17:30.717 --> 02:17:35.860]  You have Kushner going to the Middle East, and you have Cook, the Apple CEO in Bezos, going to the White House.
[02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:38.042]  This is a signal to the financial markets.
[02:17:38.042 --> 02:17:39.463]  They've picked their sides.
[02:17:39.463 --> 02:17:40.544]  That side of the media is done.
[02:17:40.544 --> 02:17:43.065]  Not only did they lose the election, they lost control.
[02:17:43.065 --> 02:17:46.688]  They lost control, and they cannot back them anymore.
[02:17:46.688 --> 02:17:47.248]  Okay?
[02:17:47.248 --> 02:17:50.930]  This is critical, though, because you do have rogue elements who are operators on the ground right now.
[02:17:50.930 --> 02:17:53.612]  Again, these people have been there for two, three decades.
[02:17:53.612 --> 02:17:57.175]  But make no mistake, this is a message to the President of the United States.
[02:17:57.175 --> 02:17:57.735]  Mr. President?
[02:17:58.812 --> 02:18:00.672]  We need you on the ground in MacDill, in St.
[02:18:00.672 --> 02:18:01.153]  Com.
[02:18:01.153 --> 02:18:03.513]  You could be read in on this, and you have to take charge.
[02:18:03.513 --> 02:18:04.693]  That's all there is to it.
[02:18:04.693 --> 02:18:05.954]  You are in charge, okay?
[02:18:05.954 --> 02:18:10.495]  These guys who are power-hungry and out of control, they're there, they're read in, they're made men.
[02:18:10.495 --> 02:18:14.215]  But you have the power to literally trump them, Huffington, and you need to do it.
[02:18:14.215 --> 02:18:15.876]  Because when you got guys like me... No, I agree.
[02:18:15.876 --> 02:18:19.096]  Just like George Washington, he has to take direct command of the military.
[02:18:19.096 --> 02:18:24.638]  Because he's so respectful of everything, he turned it over to the military, thinking it wasn't infiltrated.
[02:18:24.638 --> 02:18:26.358]  He doesn't know it's been infiltrated as well.
[02:18:28.095 --> 02:18:32.557]  And when there's guys like me and Tim Tenney on the ground, we're just not going to follow that order, and I hate to tell you that, but I'm not going to commit treason.
[02:18:32.557 --> 02:18:38.539]  I rose my right hand in front of that American flag at a MET station in Tampa, Florida, before I joined the United States military.
[02:18:38.539 --> 02:18:40.760]  Now I'm out of active duty, but I do some things.
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:41.760]  I won't get into that.
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:43.921]  Well, I'm sure everybody does things after they're out.
[02:18:43.921 --> 02:18:44.701]  Exactly.
[02:18:44.701 --> 02:18:46.282]  But we're expanding on this.
[02:18:46.282 --> 02:18:46.822]  Expanding.
[02:18:47.382 --> 02:18:50.323]  I want the listeners to realize the left wants a civil war.
[02:18:50.323 --> 02:18:51.803]  They're pushing one for real.
[02:18:51.803 --> 02:18:56.805]  And then once it starts, they're going to claim everybody that's pro-gun, pro-America is a Russian agent.
[02:18:56.805 --> 02:19:01.806]  That's why they've had Washington Post articles saying, we got guns and God from the Russians.
[02:19:01.806 --> 02:19:04.867]  Literally saying, if we want guns and God, we got it from the Russians.
[02:19:04.867 --> 02:19:09.409]  That sounds like crazy branding, but to their libtard audience, it's real.
[02:19:09.409 --> 02:19:12.230]  Now, again, I've wargamed this.
[02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:14.570]  I don't think this globalist takeover is going to work.
[02:19:14.570 --> 02:19:16.691]  That's why they need to back off and pull back right now.
[02:19:18.813 --> 02:19:29.337]  If you put together a timeline of the Megyn Kelly-Putin interview, sit down, that immediately followed by the four-day series, the four-part series on Showtime with Putin.
[02:19:29.337 --> 02:19:36.859]  You follow that up with the lead-up to your show with Megyn Kelly and the shooting down of the Syrian planes, I gotta tell you,
[02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:38.250]  It's obvious.
[02:19:38.250 --> 02:19:39.571]  And it's not a big secret.
[02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:50.522]  And quite frankly, the exercises that they have planned for later in the year, just not military, not attack exercises, but, you know, for operational exercises, this is out of control.
[02:19:50.522 --> 02:19:52.464]  This stuff's been, you know, planned two, three years ago.
[02:19:52.464 --> 02:19:58.431]  And the President of the United States has the authority to land that Air Force One in the field, get read in,
[02:19:59.231 --> 02:20:00.032]  No, I hear that.
[02:20:00.032 --> 02:20:00.732]  Alright, we'll be back.
[02:20:00.732 --> 02:20:01.072]  Good point.
[02:20:28.931 --> 02:20:29.292]  I think so.
[02:20:44.815 --> 02:20:49.518]  Big Lew will answer your call and work to fit you into a term life policy that you can afford.
[02:20:49.518 --> 02:20:53.961]  Call Term Provider, speak with Big Lew, and save on term life.

[02:21:00.405 --> 02:21:05.768]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:21:05.768 --> 02:21:08.610]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:21:08.610 --> 02:21:10.591]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:21:10.591 --> 02:21:15.573]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:21:15.573 --> 02:21:17.675]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:21:17.675 --> 02:21:18.955]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:21:18.955 --> 02:21:24.038]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:21:24.038 --> 02:21:27.380]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:30.881]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:21:30.881 --> 02:21:33.862]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:21:33.862 --> 02:21:37.523]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:21:37.523 --> 02:21:44.406]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:21:44.406 --> 02:21:51.868]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[02:22:00.034 --> 02:22:04.516]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[02:22:04.516 --> 02:22:12.478]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[02:22:12.478 --> 02:22:15.479]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[02:22:15.479 --> 02:22:19.481]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[02:22:19.481 --> 02:22:22.162]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[02:22:22.162 --> 02:22:25.843]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[02:22:26.523 --> 02:22:30.508]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[02:22:30.508 --> 02:22:35.734]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[02:22:35.734 --> 02:22:41.560]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:44.384]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[02:22:44.884 --> 02:22:46.626]  We love our freeze dryer.

[02:23:05.939 --> 02:23:08.781]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:23:08.781 --> 02:23:09.441]  Awesome.

[02:23:12.523 --> 02:23:14.104]  NASA PAC Technology.

[02:23:14.724 --> 02:23:18.867]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[02:23:18.867 --> 02:23:20.308]  Or warm and served.
[02:23:20.308 --> 02:23:22.349]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.

[02:23:29.933 --> 02:23:32.315]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:23:32.315 --> 02:23:40.358]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[02:23:40.358 --> 02:23:42.279]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:24:15.518 --> 02:24:37.564]  It is crazy to see MSM take stuff I've said and cut it all together, take it out of context, and then blow my face up even bigger than it is, and then sit there and cut into gotcha moments that didn't even happen, and to realize that it still fell flat on its face, not because I was strong, but because they are so discredited and have been caught lying so much, it's helped InfoWars and hurt them.
[02:24:37.564 --> 02:24:41.585]  But they're still in control at the top, just like you heard the last caller, and they're trying to start a war.
[02:24:43.055 --> 02:24:45.097]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call today.
[02:24:45.097 --> 02:24:48.580]  Yeah, I want to back up what that previous caller said.
[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:51.843]  I do agree with a lot of what he put out there.
[02:24:51.843 --> 02:24:55.887]  I think what's been lost in some of this though,
[02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:05.630]  Yes.
[02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.750]  Yes.
[02:25:24.406 --> 02:25:34.849]  Where, you know, I mean, you might be looking at it from an educated point of view, but when you take the other side of it, the uninformed, the wind-up toys, how are they going to see it because... No, I agree.
[02:25:34.849 --> 02:25:36.149]  I mean, no, I agree.
[02:25:36.149 --> 02:25:40.850]  It looked like it was designed to make people come after me.
[02:25:40.850 --> 02:25:41.730]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[02:25:41.730 --> 02:25:43.651]  Is it looks like it's trying to wind up somebody for violence?
[02:25:44.657 --> 02:25:46.599]  Yep, because they're using the children again.
[02:25:46.599 --> 02:25:52.663]  They wanted to bring up the Newtown children and tie in that whole narrative, so you have that, you have the Russian plane shoot down.
[02:25:52.663 --> 02:26:01.230]  Now, how much do you want to bet that maybe the killing hasn't happened fast enough in Ramadan in London, so you could say that was a right-winger over there and nobody knows yet?
[02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:03.852]  How do you know that's not a wind-up toy to get that speeded up?
[02:26:04.392 --> 02:26:11.215]  The one last missing piece I'm seeing happening here in the United States is a major racial set off to get things going on the streets.
[02:26:11.215 --> 02:26:21.920]  And they've got that Soros is funding hundreds of millions just for July 2nd and the groups are all online saying go out, attack, kill white people, kill cops, and it's white people leading it.
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:26.082]  And I'm wondering why the police and the different state agencies are putting up with this.
[02:26:26.082 --> 02:26:27.762]  We don't have a federal government right now.
[02:26:27.762 --> 02:26:29.123]  They need to move against these people.
[02:26:30.276 --> 02:26:31.177]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:31.177 --> 02:26:37.461]  I agree because I think this is the Empire striking back and right now is absolutely the time for Trump to start moving.
[02:26:37.461 --> 02:26:39.542]  Get the fireside chats going.
[02:26:39.542 --> 02:26:40.943]  Start cleaning house.
[02:26:40.943 --> 02:26:42.604]  Let Sessions loose.
[02:26:42.604 --> 02:26:44.465]  Let the new AG that's going to step up.
[02:26:44.465 --> 02:26:48.788]  If Rosenstein does recuse himself, let her loose.
[02:26:48.788 --> 02:26:50.449]  Yeah, they're flailing right now.
[02:26:50.449 --> 02:26:52.391]  I think they can see the writing on the wall.
[02:26:52.391 --> 02:26:52.871]  Absolutely.
[02:26:53.968 --> 02:26:54.929]  We're in quite a fight.
[02:26:54.929 --> 02:26:55.750]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:56.150]  Great points.
[02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:57.311]  What amazing callers.
[02:26:57.311 --> 02:26:58.472]  I should go to your calls earlier.
[02:26:58.472 --> 02:27:01.295]  I'm really honored to be in this position, quite frankly.
[02:27:01.295 --> 02:27:07.581]  I mean, quite frankly, I just can't believe that InfoWars is so prominent.
[02:27:07.581 --> 02:27:08.702]  It's the opposite of a power trip.
[02:27:08.702 --> 02:27:13.086]  I feel like I'm doing a terrible job, but I'm not trying to fish for folks to say, oh no, you're doing a good job.
[02:27:13.086 --> 02:27:18.571]  I just can't help with the magnitude of all this, just to ask myself, how have we gotten in this position?
[02:27:19.867 --> 02:27:26.629]  A lot of good men out there aren't doing anything, and you need to do something, folks, politically to speak out now to put the brakes on this, and women as well.
[02:27:26.629 --> 02:27:38.572]  But this country is on the verge of a psychotic civil war with crazy leftists running around attacking people everywhere, and they have no idea historically what they're walking into.
[02:27:38.572 --> 02:27:39.972]  I don't think the elites know what they're doing.
[02:27:39.972 --> 02:27:45.914]  I think they just want total control, and their messed up brains don't realize that they're going to lose.
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:51.382]  Let's go to Dave, and then I'll go to Al.
[02:27:51.382 --> 02:27:52.243]  Thanks for holding, Dave.
[02:27:52.243 --> 02:27:55.525]  Go ahead, in Florida.
[02:27:55.525 --> 02:27:58.107]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:27:58.107 --> 02:27:59.447]  I'm retired U.S.
[02:27:59.447 --> 02:28:03.910]  Air Force radar operator and weapons analyst.
[02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:10.194]  And this Japanese cargo ship that ran into our warship, totally bogus.
[02:28:10.194 --> 02:28:13.377]  I mean, it's confusing to think that that would happen.
[02:28:13.377 --> 02:28:15.398]  We're trying to discredit our military.
[02:28:16.229 --> 02:28:22.692]  Sure, well I'm not a naval guy like you, but I know the new radar they've got will see like a tin can floating a half mile, two miles away.
[02:28:22.692 --> 02:28:29.135]  I mean, describe for folks why you're saying it's bull, just because they've got proximity sensors, you name it?
[02:28:29.135 --> 02:28:42.421]  Well, they keep a 50 mile radius around the ship, and if those radars are down for maintenance, they'll use the satellite data link to make sure that there's no other ships in the area.
[02:28:43.474 --> 02:28:49.398]  I just can't fathom this happening and it's just spreading in our military.
[02:28:49.398 --> 02:28:50.539]  Well, the Navy agrees with you.
[02:28:50.539 --> 02:28:56.443]  They say they don't understand how this happened.
[02:28:56.443 --> 02:29:04.268]  I think they're just trying to show weakness to our military and destroy our morale.
[02:29:04.268 --> 02:29:05.109]  Well, that's a question.
[02:29:05.109 --> 02:29:06.190]  I mean, how did this freighter
[02:29:08.496 --> 02:29:11.378]  Container ship, and then that's giant on a radar signature.
[02:29:11.378 --> 02:29:16.502]  I mean, I've been on commercial ships and seen their radar going out just many, many miles.
[02:29:16.502 --> 02:29:19.244]  I don't know how that happened.
[02:29:19.244 --> 02:29:21.426]  Well, the container ship has radar, too.
[02:29:21.426 --> 02:29:29.492]  So, I don't... It's just an unknown thing that's driving me crazy.
[02:29:29.492 --> 02:29:30.934]  A lot of weird stuff's going on.
[02:29:30.934 --> 02:29:33.676]  It really is strange.
[02:29:33.676 --> 02:29:35.097]  Bizarre.
[02:29:35.097 --> 02:29:36.378]  Wow, thank you so much, Dave.
[02:29:37.555 --> 02:29:38.716]  That's the thing.
[02:29:38.716 --> 02:29:44.020]  You know, I just got a bad feeling about Russia right now.
[02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:45.761]  And all the stuff that's going on.
[02:29:45.761 --> 02:29:47.502]  I just don't know.
[02:29:47.502 --> 02:29:47.943]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.943 --> 02:29:49.824]  More calls coming up.
[02:29:49.824 --> 02:29:51.225]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.225 --> 02:29:53.747]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.747 --> 02:29:56.449]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.155 --> 02:30:03.697]  Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine.
[02:30:03.697 --> 02:30:12.764]  On Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage of the New York Public Disgrace Theater showing of Caesar, which should really be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination of President Trump.
[02:30:12.764 --> 02:30:22.031]  She rushed the stage insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands, as well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[02:30:22.031 --> 02:30:29.757]  While she was being arrested, Jack Posobiec went live on Twitter to broadcast the event, and then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience
[02:30:29.957 --> 02:30:30.577]  We're good to go.
[02:30:49.204 --> 02:30:57.829]  Rumor has it some of the police involved support the protest against the expression of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York Public Theater against our president.
[02:30:57.829 --> 02:31:00.391]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:31:00.905 --> 02:31:02.725]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:02.725 --> 02:31:04.826]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:04.826 --> 02:31:07.727]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:07.727 --> 02:31:13.788]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:13.788 --> 02:31:22.971]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:22.971 --> 02:31:27.832]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:31:28.052 --> 02:31:30.496]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:30.496 --> 02:31:38.547]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:38.547 --> 02:31:39.528]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:40.709 --> 02:31:44.090]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:44.090 --> 02:31:48.231]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:48.231 --> 02:31:54.934]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:54.934 --> 02:31:59.015]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:02.281 --> 02:32:07.764]  The reason InfoWarsLife has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:32:07.764 --> 02:32:08.604]  I take this.
[02:32:08.604 --> 02:32:09.725]  My family takes this.
[02:32:09.725 --> 02:32:14.027]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:32:14.027 --> 02:32:18.229]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:18.629 --> 02:32:23.252]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:32:23.252 --> 02:32:24.393]  I don't feel good.
[02:32:24.393 --> 02:32:28.136]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:32:28.136 --> 02:32:30.838]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:32:30.838 --> 02:32:36.642]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:32:36.642 --> 02:32:39.604]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:32:39.604 --> 02:32:43.146]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:32:43.146 --> 02:32:45.368]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:32:45.368 --> 02:32:45.728]  I love it.
[02:32:45.888 --> 02:32:48.691]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:32:48.691 --> 02:32:49.692]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:49.692 --> 02:32:55.358]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:55.358 --> 02:32:57.540]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:32:57.540 --> 02:32:58.762]  It's a win-win.
[02:32:58.762 --> 02:32:59.562]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:15.359 --> 02:33:27.707]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:27.707 --> 02:33:28.668]  Hollywood Babylon.
[02:33:30.376 --> 02:33:33.358]  Joe Biggs is our guest in studio.
[02:33:33.358 --> 02:33:36.020]  Veteran Patriot, he's been an InfoWars reporter full-time.
[02:33:36.020 --> 02:33:43.486]  He still does it for its part-time, but he's got his baby and been doing that and also freelancing, doing a great job.
[02:33:43.486 --> 02:33:49.550]  So tearing up Twitter and Facebook, Joe Biggs in studio with us because Megyn Kelly attacked him as well last night.
[02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:56.475]  We're going to go to Al and Eric and of course O'Brien and Joseph before we end the show.
[02:33:56.475 --> 02:33:59.298]  Mike Cernovich is going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:34:00.138 --> 02:34:04.400]  David and I took a personal day, so that'll be Mike Cernovich who's here visiting.
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:10.303]  I'm trying to launch a larger radio slash TV network so we can have more hosts with their own shows doing their own thing.
[02:34:10.303 --> 02:34:14.245]  We can have Joe hopefully come back and do that once we have all that launched.
[02:34:14.245 --> 02:34:16.886]  But so much going on, so much happening.
[02:34:16.886 --> 02:34:19.027]  First off, to do that we need to fund the operation.
[02:34:19.847 --> 02:34:20.047]  We're
[02:34:36.545 --> 02:34:37.966]  Blocks the bad halogens.
[02:34:37.966 --> 02:34:41.687]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off even though we're selling out of it.
[02:34:41.687 --> 02:34:44.268]  Z-Shield, the heavy metal and toxin detoxer.
[02:34:44.268 --> 02:34:49.370]  Brand new product with all the shilajit and the zeolites and everything else to draw the garbage out of your body.
[02:34:49.370 --> 02:34:52.191]  InfoWare Select storable foods, 40% off.
[02:34:52.191 --> 02:34:53.072]  We rarely do that.
[02:34:53.072 --> 02:34:56.593]  Emrix Essentials Outdoor Pack, 40% off.
[02:34:56.593 --> 02:34:59.134]  And if you add on auto ship, it's a lost leader.
[02:34:59.134 --> 02:35:03.696]  So, Living Defense, 20% off even though it's about to sell out to flush all those parasites out.
[02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:07.534]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:07.534 --> 02:35:12.362]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:35:12.362 --> 02:35:15.367]  I'm trying to expand in the face of the globalists and we cannot do it without you.
[02:35:16.206 --> 02:35:23.489]  No, we have a lot of stuff that sells quite a bit, but a lot of it like Knockout we make almost no money on because I designed it.
[02:35:23.489 --> 02:35:34.273]  I just thought, why am I taking some L-Tryptophan and Valerian Root and sometimes Melatonin to sleep good when it cost me like $60 for all three of these bottles.
[02:35:34.273 --> 02:35:35.974]  I went and checked how much that stuff actually costs.
[02:35:37.096 --> 02:35:40.177]  Well, that cost a dollar, that cost 30 cents, that cost a dollar, that cost 20 cents.
[02:35:40.177 --> 02:35:44.718]  I said, we'll sell it for $19.95, and it'll have nine ingredients.
[02:35:44.718 --> 02:35:47.558]  Each ingredient has the same level of the leading competitor.
[02:35:47.558 --> 02:35:55.200]  So $19 for the same amount of melatonin, we have at $19 with all the other stuff in Mother Nature to really knock you out.
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:57.600]  I just get mad when I forget to take it, then wake up at 3 a.m.
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:35:58.120]  That's what happens.
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:02.721]  I'll go to bed at like 10, I'll wake up at 3 a.m., and if I take my knockout, I don't.
[02:36:02.721 --> 02:36:04.462]  We gotta sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[02:36:05.282 --> 02:36:09.946]  It has lemon balm extract, it has melatonin, L-tryptophan, valerian root, and so much more.
[02:36:09.946 --> 02:36:15.590]  Plus it's got key amino acids to help you upload it electrochemically into the brain.
[02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:18.913]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, there are so many of these great products.
[02:36:18.913 --> 02:36:22.116]  Be sure and check them out today so we can fund the operation.
[02:36:22.116 --> 02:36:25.038]  I want to salute you all and thank you for what you do.
[02:36:25.038 --> 02:36:26.799]  You make it all possible.
[02:36:26.799 --> 02:36:29.882]  A lot of stuff you notice is sold out for five, six months.
[02:36:29.882 --> 02:36:31.363]  It's not done to create artificial scarcity.
[02:36:31.363 --> 02:36:34.205]  It's done because we try to follow California standards.
[02:36:35.106 --> 02:36:36.928]  Almost all of our products are at that level.
[02:36:36.928 --> 02:36:42.632]  Sometimes we just can't get stuff that's California Standard because it has to have less heavy metal than the air does in it.
[02:36:42.632 --> 02:36:45.114]  And so we discontinue a product or we discontinue stuff in it.
[02:36:45.114 --> 02:36:53.241]  In fact, I'm getting ready to discontinue three or four products or change it up in case you can't get the ingredients that are totally clean.
[02:36:53.241 --> 02:37:00.727]  So it's kind of like, you know, if I had DNA Force in all the time and if I had a few other products in like Caveman, we could fund this whole thing.
[02:37:01.769 --> 02:37:05.990]  Caveman, four months to make more of it because it's so hard to get the organic bone broth.
[02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:08.511]  I mean, it's just bringing you quality like this.
[02:37:08.511 --> 02:37:12.292]  The reason we are loved by the supplement Nazis, that's a Seinfeld illusion.
[02:37:12.292 --> 02:37:13.392]  We're not real Nazis.
[02:37:13.392 --> 02:37:25.336]  By the real folks that are experts on supplements, third-party site says, we go to a super neurotic level to treat you like we want to be treated, but also we know we're a target of the FDA and others, so we want to be next level.
[02:37:26.255 --> 02:37:27.456]  You know, game-changing.
[02:37:27.456 --> 02:37:33.779]  So that's why the big third-party sites love us, because we're using the top companies, the cleanest companies in the nation.
[02:37:33.779 --> 02:37:39.903]  But at one point, if I can't get a product because it's got to be so clean for myself, I'll go, okay, forget California standards.
[02:37:39.903 --> 02:37:41.463]  So I treat you like I want to be treated.
[02:37:41.463 --> 02:37:48.147]  So if we start not being California standards and start putting it on our products, you know, I'll tell you why, because I'm going to be taking it too.
[02:37:48.147 --> 02:37:49.628]  It's either don't have it or have it.
[02:37:49.628 --> 02:37:53.050]  The earth's going to get so contaminated, you know, nothing will be perfectly clean.
[02:37:54.764 --> 02:37:55.685]  I'm not going to get into it anymore.
[02:37:55.685 --> 02:37:58.948]  The point is, these are the cleanest, highest quality organic products out there.
[02:37:58.948 --> 02:38:01.630]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:38:01.630 --> 02:38:11.757]  Now, joining us, joining us in studio, Joe Biggs, Infowars Auxiliary Reporter, freelance reporter, does his own great work.
[02:38:11.757 --> 02:38:13.158]  Joe, it's great to have you here with us.
[02:38:13.158 --> 02:38:14.219]  Oh yeah, it's been a while.
[02:38:14.219 --> 02:38:15.640]  Looking sharp in the black on black.
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:16.480]  Yes sir.
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:18.622]  You're all murdered out in your suit right now.
[02:38:18.622 --> 02:38:18.902]  Oh yeah.
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:21.801]  Time to go to war.
[02:38:21.801 --> 02:38:24.482]  Hey, how is it being a daddy?
[02:38:24.482 --> 02:38:31.966]  Oh, you know, I'm getting used to being back on that military regiment of not sleeping hardly ever and barely eating.
[02:38:31.966 --> 02:38:33.207]  But I'm kind of getting used to it.
[02:38:33.207 --> 02:38:36.689]  I mean, there's a few nights where I was like, but it's like I went to bed at six.
[02:38:36.689 --> 02:38:38.390]  I was up at nine to do the Gavin McGinnis show.
[02:38:38.390 --> 02:38:39.490]  I'm here now.
[02:38:39.490 --> 02:38:40.131]  I'm wide awake.
[02:38:40.131 --> 02:38:40.631]  I'm good to go.
[02:38:40.631 --> 02:38:42.092]  It's awesome.
[02:38:42.092 --> 02:38:44.333]  Like, it's cool looking at like a little thing that's just like you.
[02:38:45.814 --> 02:38:46.435]  It's pretty.
[02:38:46.435 --> 02:38:47.335]  I like your wedding ring too.
[02:38:47.335 --> 02:38:48.416]  It's pretty gnarly.
[02:38:48.416 --> 02:38:49.377]  I never found one that's cool enough.
[02:38:49.377 --> 02:38:50.858]  Maybe I'll just copy you.
[02:38:50.858 --> 02:38:52.700]  And there's your little sweetheart wearing a Trump shirt.
[02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:53.881]  Oh yeah, she's got it on right now.
[02:38:53.881 --> 02:38:55.622]  She's trying to build the wall.
[02:38:55.622 --> 02:39:00.987]  And of course, you know, what Obama said, kids that play with Legos, they didn't build that.
[02:39:00.987 --> 02:39:04.250]  Getting serious, I guess you weren't watching the Megyn Kelly thing last night.
[02:39:04.250 --> 02:39:06.251]  You told me on the phone this morning and you got blown up.
[02:39:06.251 --> 02:39:06.592]  What happened?
[02:39:07.383 --> 02:39:10.625]  Yeah, my phone started going off and they're like, are you seeing this interview right now?
[02:39:10.625 --> 02:39:11.486]  And I go, what are you talking about?
[02:39:11.486 --> 02:39:12.147]  Is it on already?
[02:39:12.147 --> 02:39:13.368]  And they're like, yeah, the Megyn Kelly thing.
[02:39:13.368 --> 02:39:15.509]  They're blasting your border video.
[02:39:15.509 --> 02:39:16.950]  And I go, what?
[02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:17.811]  Why?
[02:39:17.811 --> 02:39:19.352]  What does it have to do with anything?
[02:39:19.352 --> 02:39:21.133]  I've been to the border so many times.
[02:39:21.133 --> 02:39:23.955]  It took me about an hour to figure out which video they were talking about.
[02:39:23.955 --> 02:39:26.397]  And when they picked that one, I was the most shocked.
[02:39:26.397 --> 02:39:26.758]  I was like...
[02:39:27.758 --> 02:39:34.682]  Like, did you actually think that I went down to Laredo, I found like seven, you know, cartel guys that come stage this event or something?
[02:39:34.682 --> 02:39:40.785]  I mean, what does Megyn Kelly think they're smuggling, piñatas?
[02:39:40.785 --> 02:39:46.027]  Or little teddy bears to give to Glenn Beck so he can smudge Cheetos all over his face while he plays with them?
[02:39:46.027 --> 02:39:46.948]  That's what I was saying.
[02:39:48.334 --> 02:39:49.115]  I love it.
[02:39:49.115 --> 02:39:52.560]  Or like, yeah, they're like smuggling Keebler elves or something.
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:56.845]  I'm like, these guys are literally risking life and limb to come over the board illegally.
[02:39:56.845 --> 02:40:01.331]  And then they throw these satchels into a back of a, it was like a burgundy Ford Explorer.
[02:40:01.331 --> 02:40:01.992]  And it runs off.
[02:40:01.992 --> 02:40:06.177]  It speeds off and almost gets hit, T-bone, by a tractor trailer truck.
[02:40:06.963 --> 02:40:07.983]  I mean, you don't do that.
[02:40:07.983 --> 02:40:09.524]  Meanwhile, you guys are in the hotel right there.
[02:40:09.524 --> 02:40:12.045]  There's like people creeping around, trying to get in your rooms.
[02:40:12.045 --> 02:40:23.750]  So when we were out there, when Josh Owens and I were out there on the riverbank at the Rio Grande and Laredo, we noticed right before this whole thing happened, we saw two Border Patrol vehicles jet off.
[02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:24.651]  We thought that was kind of weird.
[02:40:25.111 --> 02:40:32.356]  Then two or three little boys came down, one was bouncing a basketball, one had a flip phone, and another one had a cell phone, and they were filming my stand-up.
[02:40:32.356 --> 02:40:35.318]  And I was talking about how Donald Trump was going to be coming to Laredo tomorrow.
[02:40:35.318 --> 02:40:37.419]  This is going to be his first trip to the border.
[02:40:37.419 --> 02:40:48.807]  You know, this is a very key thing that's going to happen to really, you know, solidify and talk about why we need to secure the border and what it is we can do to help, you know, lock this down and keep bad people from coming in.
[02:40:48.807 --> 02:40:50.328]  It's a basic newsworthy report.
[02:40:50.328 --> 02:40:51.329]  We're in Texas.
[02:40:51.329 --> 02:40:52.630]  Go cover before the president comes.
[02:40:53.570 --> 02:40:55.832]  And he just, I mean, it just happens to happen.
[02:40:55.832 --> 02:40:57.474]  I mean, right there, I mean, you're on the border.
[02:40:57.474 --> 02:41:00.136]  We've been covering border issues for I don't know how long since I've been here.
[02:41:00.136 --> 02:41:06.662]  For the last four years, myself, Jakari Jackson, Adon Salazar, Kit Daniels, John Bowne, we've all been out there.
[02:41:06.662 --> 02:41:09.445]  And every time we've been out there, we've caught some kind of thing happening.
[02:41:09.565 --> 02:41:22.334]  And you've had ICE tell you stuff behind the scenes and on record and the police and so we've got and you've been debriefed by the FBI you've gone over the border you discovered the ISIS house which a year later Judicial Watch confirmed in government documents was an ISIS base.
[02:41:22.334 --> 02:41:39.185]  And they did a documentary that was aired in January on their YouTube page it only has 3,000 views it's called the Sun City Sale and it talks about actual Al-Qaeda members top Al-Qaeda members flying into Donna Anna New Mexico into a private airport that's not even monitored by our US government.
[02:41:39.765 --> 02:42:03.222]  And these guys get out and go into Anthony, New Mexico, these two top arcade leaders, and meet with cartel guys and figure out a game plan on how they... So that said, you're a guy, a military guy, that's been in Rolling Stone and other big profiles, you know, covering you in combat, and you've been on TV shows, and you've been a journalist for years, and you've broken a lot of big stories, and you've gotten big interviews, but Megyn Kelly doesn't care.
[02:42:03.222 --> 02:42:07.325]  She shows Owen Schroer and says, he's not real, he doesn't do research, he's bad.
[02:42:07.745 --> 02:42:10.707]  And then she cuts to you and she goes, part of Alex Jones is fakeness.
[02:42:10.707 --> 02:42:11.588]  Well, here, let's play the clip.
[02:42:11.588 --> 02:42:14.110]  Let's play the clip from Megyn Kelly.
[02:42:14.110 --> 02:42:16.752]  I mean, I know Trump watches and sees the clips and things.
[02:42:16.752 --> 02:42:19.254]  We did find indications of that.
[02:42:19.254 --> 02:42:29.422]  On July 22, 2015, InfoWars put up this video claiming it showed drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico border, although we don't know what it actually shows.
[02:42:29.422 --> 02:42:30.763]  We actually witnessed
[02:42:31.503 --> 02:42:35.725]  A drug smuggling operation from Mexico into the US.
[02:42:35.725 --> 02:42:36.125]  Who's that guy?
[02:42:36.125 --> 02:42:39.346]  Three days later, Mr. Trump gave this speech in Iowa.
[02:42:39.346 --> 02:42:41.307]  Big story, it's all over the place now.
[02:42:41.307 --> 02:42:49.109]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff, drugs, swimming across the river.
[02:42:49.109 --> 02:42:50.510]  And then she goes on to demonize us.
[02:42:50.510 --> 02:42:53.291]  Now again, we have HD footage of broad daylight.
[02:42:54.212 --> 02:42:58.276]  People coming across with these big 55-pound bags.
[02:42:58.276 --> 02:42:59.438]  We've shown it to law enforcement.
[02:42:59.438 --> 02:43:00.419]  They go, yes, that's marijuana.
[02:43:00.419 --> 02:43:01.380]  It's floating.
[02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:02.681]  The cartels package it the same.
[02:43:02.681 --> 02:43:03.822]  It's well-known.
[02:43:03.822 --> 02:43:05.043]  And then they've got the waiting car.
[02:43:05.043 --> 02:43:06.965]  You guys get both angles of it.
[02:43:06.965 --> 02:43:07.946]  It's clearly drugs.
[02:43:07.946 --> 02:43:09.148]  It's clearly something illegal.
[02:43:09.148 --> 02:43:14.593]  They just smuggled it across international lines, national lines, so it is illegal.
[02:43:15.574 --> 02:43:18.757]  And so this is how they do it, in these green and brown satchels.
[02:43:18.757 --> 02:43:19.718]  We have the total proof.
[02:43:19.718 --> 02:43:23.081]  She knows our report, shows the FBI briefing you.
[02:43:23.081 --> 02:43:28.365]  She knows your report, shows where you talk to the state police and the border patrol.
[02:43:28.365 --> 02:43:30.547]  You've got it all, just like you're supposed to in a report.
[02:43:30.547 --> 02:43:34.651]  Even the local Laredo News picked up on it, and they were playing that on their nightly news.
[02:43:34.651 --> 02:43:37.173]  Sure, everyone said it was obviously drugs.
[02:43:37.173 --> 02:43:38.034]  But no, no, no, no.
[02:43:38.034 --> 02:43:39.775]  But see, we're not allowed.
[02:43:39.775 --> 02:43:40.235]  Here's the key.
[02:43:41.016 --> 02:43:47.400]  To look at that as our own journals, and go down and show it, and catch it, that's a great find for anybody.
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:48.921]  That's an A+.
[02:43:48.921 --> 02:43:52.403]  That's the thing you win awards for, but not Megyn Kelly's, see?
[02:43:52.403 --> 02:43:54.765]  And again, it's the whole reports like that.
[02:43:54.765 --> 02:43:57.147]  The problem was, I shouldn't have let her interview me off and on.
[02:43:57.147 --> 02:43:59.808]  They were here from 9.30 to 11.
[02:43:59.808 --> 02:44:06.733]  They had me off this house for almost two hours, and I noticed she kept asking the same questions, and then doing gotchas, and then saying really insulting things.
[02:44:07.173 --> 02:44:11.519]  The funny thing is how she questions you and Owen and others about being a journalist.
[02:44:11.519 --> 02:44:18.109]  Meanwhile, she's the same lady who sits down behind a desk, reads a teleprompter, and reads words that another person came up with.
[02:44:18.109 --> 02:44:19.931]  You're not even original thoughts 90% of the time.
[02:44:19.931 --> 02:44:21.133]  That's a really good point, Joe.
[02:44:21.133 --> 02:44:21.854]  You're not even a journalist.
[02:44:24.876 --> 02:44:31.737]  That's a great point.
[02:44:31.737 --> 02:44:33.738]  She's a teleprompter reader.
[02:44:33.738 --> 02:44:37.959]  We're our own organic citizen media just going out trying to tell the truth.
[02:44:37.959 --> 02:44:40.980]  I was in the Ferguson riots, the Baltimore riots, in Milwaukee.
[02:44:40.980 --> 02:44:42.620]  I was in Paris the day after the attacks.
[02:44:42.620 --> 02:44:43.500]  I was at the St.
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:48.982]  Denis raids in northern Paris when they found the lady and the guys that blew themselves up with the suicide vests.
[02:44:50.302 --> 02:44:50.943]  Sure, why not?
[02:45:06.348 --> 02:45:06.568]  Good.
[02:45:06.568 --> 02:45:11.130]  Well, we'll program it with you and Owen Schroyer.
[02:45:11.130 --> 02:45:13.631]  And if David Knight's better by then, he's got a cold.
[02:45:13.631 --> 02:45:15.391]  I said personal day, but he's got a cold.
[02:45:15.391 --> 02:45:16.892]  You can't drag David away from the microphone.
[02:45:16.892 --> 02:45:18.072]  Just like me, it's a good thing.
[02:45:18.072 --> 02:45:22.794]  But I'm taking off two days, because I'm getting a little crazed, OK, behind the scenes here.
[02:45:22.794 --> 02:45:24.114]  So I'm going to give everybody a break.
[02:45:24.114 --> 02:45:25.335]  I'm going to take two days off.
[02:45:25.335 --> 02:45:25.875]  So that's great.
[02:45:25.875 --> 02:45:28.236]  Come in and host Wednesday.
[02:45:28.236 --> 02:45:29.056]  Sounds good.
[02:45:29.056 --> 02:45:30.617]  And so just come in about an hour before.
[02:45:30.617 --> 02:45:31.637]  They can run through all the stories.
[02:45:32.097 --> 02:45:36.763]  I won't be able to control myself, I'll undoubtedly call in, and then you guys can run the gamut.
[02:45:36.763 --> 02:45:37.684]  Sounds good.
[02:45:37.684 --> 02:45:39.387]  Alright, but continuing...
[02:45:40.717 --> 02:45:48.084]  A lot of folks I've talked to say, hey, you showed the early video, you showed she was a liar, it was a hit piece, you don't even need to release all the audio.
[02:45:48.084 --> 02:45:51.086]  But I said I would, and Sean Hannity has a point.
[02:45:51.086 --> 02:45:55.690]  He wants it released, and I've been called by other folks at Fox, they are very interested in it.
[02:45:55.690 --> 02:46:03.878]  They won't tell me why, they just say execs are very interested, and I think this is kind of a career killer to have her editing things out of sync.
[02:46:04.338 --> 02:46:09.643]  Well, I mean, you've got her clearly on audio saying, hey, this isn't a gotcha piece, this isn't a hit piece.
[02:46:09.643 --> 02:46:11.364]  I'm profiling you as Alex.
[02:46:11.364 --> 02:46:13.286]  This isn't the conspiracy.
[02:46:13.286 --> 02:46:14.467]  I'm obsessed with you.
[02:46:14.467 --> 02:46:17.249]  I think I want to show your good side.
[02:46:17.249 --> 02:46:20.832]  She's like, yeah, I've been really following you ever since your, you know, your family court case and all that.
[02:46:20.832 --> 02:46:23.535]  And I just, I'm interested in Alex Jones, the person.
[02:46:23.535 --> 02:46:25.056]  And then it's just like, boom, boom, boom.
[02:46:25.056 --> 02:46:26.777]  Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[02:46:26.777 --> 02:46:28.219]  You know, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[02:46:28.219 --> 02:46:28.859]  And I'm just sitting here like.
[02:46:28.859 --> 02:46:30.621]  She says it will not be a gotcha piece.
[02:46:30.621 --> 02:46:31.802]  And she literally goes, gotcha!
[02:46:33.254 --> 02:46:35.476]  Actually, we went gotcha.
[02:46:35.476 --> 02:46:38.238]  She tried to go gotcha, and we actually did a better one on her.
[02:46:38.238 --> 02:46:40.600]  I mean, right now, she's losing.
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:44.483]  Can you believe her show has half the ratings it had when she started?
[02:46:44.483 --> 02:46:45.564]  It's worse than what is it?
[02:46:45.564 --> 02:46:53.029]  Joe, we had 20-something million views on Infowars in between me and Cernovich just on like 10 videos or so.
[02:46:53.029 --> 02:46:56.292]  I mean, that's just me counting up the videos I looked at.
[02:46:56.292 --> 02:46:59.114]  22 million or more views, and then her show has 3.5.
[02:46:59.114 --> 02:46:59.955]  These people are a joke!
[02:47:01.909 --> 02:47:06.631]  I'm sure the reruns of Andy Griffith are probably getting more views than her show.
[02:47:06.631 --> 02:47:08.172]  That's a quality program right there.
[02:47:08.172 --> 02:47:08.952]  Exactly.
[02:47:08.952 --> 02:47:10.073]  So where do you think she goes?
[02:47:10.073 --> 02:47:11.214]  I'm not an enemy with her either.
[02:47:11.214 --> 02:47:11.974]  Where does she go?
[02:47:11.974 --> 02:47:12.314]  I don't know.
[02:47:12.314 --> 02:47:14.875]  Hopefully back under the rock she came from.
[02:47:14.875 --> 02:47:16.936]  Maybe just go home and be a mom.
[02:47:16.936 --> 02:47:18.057]  Go be a wife.
[02:47:18.057 --> 02:47:18.977]  Go be a mom.
[02:47:18.977 --> 02:47:20.778]  What do you think this signifies for MSN?
[02:47:20.778 --> 02:47:22.159]  That they threw everything they could at us.
[02:47:22.779 --> 02:47:24.140]  Obviously to hurt Trump.
[02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:25.722]  I mean, why do they hate Trump so much?
[02:47:25.722 --> 02:47:31.387]  I mean, he's got so much done, I can't help but fawn over him, because if I don't, it's a lie.
[02:47:31.387 --> 02:47:33.769]  I mean, we ought to throw rose petals in front of his feet.
[02:47:33.769 --> 02:47:34.610]  He's being demonized.
[02:47:34.610 --> 02:47:35.651]  He's being lied to.
[02:47:35.651 --> 02:47:36.552]  They're trying to destroy him.
[02:47:36.552 --> 02:47:38.514]  They're saying, kill him, everywhere.
[02:47:38.514 --> 02:47:42.297]  And all he's done is gotten the economy turned back on, and he still may fail.
[02:47:42.297 --> 02:47:45.080]  Ron Paul says he's doing a great job, but it's sputtering, folks.
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:47.282]  And what are these people going to do when they blow up the economy?
[02:47:47.722 --> 02:47:53.126]  Well, think about how the mainstream media kicked Barack Obama's butt, or kissed his butt the entire time.
[02:47:53.126 --> 02:47:54.448]  Non-stop, day in and day out.
[02:47:54.448 --> 02:47:58.191]  They said ban a Hispanic guy doing a rodeo clown of Obama.
[02:47:58.191 --> 02:48:00.112]  They had that banned.
[02:48:00.112 --> 02:48:02.254]  But they say, let us openly say kill the president.
[02:48:03.032 --> 02:48:08.974]  You know, Barack Obama even frothed the mouth like, oh, I love CNN, I love MSNBC, these guys are so great.
[02:48:08.974 --> 02:48:10.215]  And President Trump's not doing that.
[02:48:10.215 --> 02:48:11.315]  He goes, you guys are fake news.
[02:48:11.315 --> 02:48:13.716]  He's like, actually, no, you're really fake news.
[02:48:13.716 --> 02:48:15.977]  And you're BS and you're BS and you're BS.
[02:48:15.977 --> 02:48:17.898]  And then what pisses Megyn Kelly off is the fact that
[02:48:18.818 --> 02:48:25.701]  She sees that the president is watching Real News and sharing our stories and watching it and getting some information.
[02:48:25.701 --> 02:48:29.923]  Because how can she say that we're not journalists when she doesn't get out from behind her desk?
[02:48:29.923 --> 02:48:30.884]  I'm on the border.
[02:48:30.884 --> 02:48:31.684]  We're on the border.
[02:48:31.684 --> 02:48:32.524]  We're in France.
[02:48:32.524 --> 02:48:33.285]  We're in London.
[02:48:33.285 --> 02:48:34.225]  We're all over the place.
[02:48:34.225 --> 02:48:35.846]  We go all over the world.
[02:48:35.846 --> 02:48:36.806]  Has she ever been to Haiti?
[02:48:36.806 --> 02:48:38.707]  Has she uncovered anything out there?
[02:48:38.707 --> 02:48:39.387]  Negative.
[02:48:39.387 --> 02:48:41.448]  She doesn't even have her own original thoughts.
[02:48:41.448 --> 02:48:44.850]  By the way, can you guys pull up landing in Haiti, Joe Biggs and Zimmerman?
[02:48:44.850 --> 02:48:47.231]  I had no idea that people died that day landing there.
[02:48:47.631 --> 02:48:48.611]  High winds, they're landing.
[02:48:48.611 --> 02:48:49.392]  Oh, right after we left.
[02:48:49.392 --> 02:48:50.892]  It was like the day after.
[02:48:50.892 --> 02:48:53.513]  You're like landing and there's like six foot grass he's landing.
[02:48:53.513 --> 02:48:53.994]  I mean, what?
[02:48:53.994 --> 02:48:56.515]  Yeah, and then there was a ship.
[02:48:56.515 --> 02:48:57.795]  I can't remember what military it was.
[02:48:57.795 --> 02:49:01.757]  It was a ship that came in and approached the bank where I had to get into a boat that was sinking.
[02:49:02.953 --> 02:49:09.795]  Uh, the day before, there was a boat that came in to bring aid to be dropped off, and the, uh, local Haitians ran, because they were starving.
[02:49:09.795 --> 02:49:11.376]  I mean, they just had Hurricane Matthew.
[02:49:11.376 --> 02:49:12.456]  They have no food.
[02:49:12.456 --> 02:49:16.177]  All the trees, when you flew overhead, it looked like toothpicks laying down.
[02:49:16.177 --> 02:49:20.118]  And these, these hungry Haitians are storming towards the beach because they just want food.
[02:49:20.118 --> 02:49:22.799]  And the military opened up and started shooting them and mowing them down.
[02:49:23.772 --> 02:49:26.673]  I mean, just the things that happened there were horrific.
[02:49:26.673 --> 02:49:30.175]  And you guys found out about the pedophilia, which six months later AP confirmed.
[02:49:30.175 --> 02:49:30.755]  Yeah.
[02:49:30.755 --> 02:49:32.216]  But notice, they don't talk about all our victories.
[02:49:32.216 --> 02:49:33.677]  They just make up stuff we didn't do.
[02:49:33.677 --> 02:49:34.857]  Yeah.
[02:49:34.857 --> 02:49:36.278]  But let me ask you this question again.
[02:49:36.278 --> 02:49:40.100]  Just a microcosm of that show saying we're not real journalists.
[02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:44.061]  We don't know that was drugs, when even local news said clearly it was.
[02:49:44.061 --> 02:49:45.842]  Law enforcement came and met and said, great job.
[02:49:45.842 --> 02:49:48.683]  I mean, we got the articles where the FBI met with you.
[02:49:48.683 --> 02:49:49.663]  How does she do that?
[02:49:49.663 --> 02:49:55.285]  Does she not get that everyone watching goes, obviously that's drugs being smuggled across the Rio Grande.
[02:49:55.285 --> 02:50:04.107]  Oh yeah, people were tweeting me all day yesterday, writing me messages on Facebook like, what'd you think was coming across, you know, you know, teddy bears or, you know, humanitarian aid.
[02:50:04.107 --> 02:50:07.889]  I'm like, yeah, that's exactly what was coming across, humanitarian aid.
[02:50:07.889 --> 02:50:08.469]  Yeah.
[02:50:10.069 --> 02:50:12.530]  Here you maniacs are landing on the grass.
[02:50:12.530 --> 02:50:14.030]  Yeah, that's what everyone's been landed on.
[02:50:14.030 --> 02:50:15.791]  And at the end is a cliff.
[02:50:15.791 --> 02:50:17.091]  Yeah.
[02:50:17.091 --> 02:50:24.333]  This right here is a spot where Dom Marie, that's where we got surrounded by like 500 Haitians.
[02:50:24.333 --> 02:50:27.334]  They're running up to us, surrounding us in this plane.
[02:50:27.334 --> 02:50:28.575]  We're in the middle of nowhere.
[02:50:28.575 --> 02:50:30.435]  I mean, you've got nowhere to go.
[02:50:30.435 --> 02:50:36.217]  You're the furthest western tip on the southern peninsula of Haiti there is, and you're on your own.
[02:50:39.096 --> 02:50:41.839]  Man, look at that devastation.
[02:50:41.839 --> 02:50:43.080]  But this is real reporting.
[02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:44.241]  NBC doesn't do this.
[02:50:44.241 --> 02:50:45.382]  No.
[02:50:45.382 --> 02:50:46.743]  But you're scared.
[02:50:46.743 --> 02:50:52.228]  Well, let's come back and talk more about the Russia situation because clearly Deep State's trying to start a war with Russia.
[02:50:52.228 --> 02:50:53.449]  What will that do for us?
[02:50:53.449 --> 02:50:54.851]  And then Mike Cernovich is coming in.
[02:50:54.851 --> 02:50:56.072]  I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:50:56.072 --> 02:50:58.914]  O'Brien, Joseph, Eric, Al, I'm going to y'all.
[02:50:58.914 --> 02:50:59.475]  I'm coming to you.
[02:51:01.141 --> 02:51:05.623]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[02:51:05.623 --> 02:51:13.586]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[02:51:13.586 --> 02:51:16.587]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[02:51:16.587 --> 02:51:20.589]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[02:51:20.589 --> 02:51:23.270]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[02:51:23.270 --> 02:51:26.952]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[02:51:27.632 --> 02:51:31.614]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[02:51:31.614 --> 02:51:36.837]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[02:51:36.837 --> 02:51:42.660]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[02:51:42.660 --> 02:51:45.482]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[02:51:45.982 --> 02:51:47.724]  We love our freeze dryer.
[02:51:47.724 --> 02:51:50.548]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-923-9591.

[02:52:02.197 --> 02:52:14.586]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic high quality.
[02:52:14.586 --> 02:52:19.610]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country.
[02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:20.851]  It's all there!
[02:52:40.626 --> 02:52:41.948]  It's truly game-changing.
[02:52:41.948 --> 02:52:44.971]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different.
[02:52:44.971 --> 02:52:49.896]  Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores.

[02:53:02.108 --> 02:53:07.430]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:53:07.430 --> 02:53:09.011]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:17.355]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:53:25.037 --> 02:53:27.298]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[02:54:10.612 --> 02:54:17.638]  All right, I think I'm going to go ahead and co-host with Cernovich into the fourth hour and Joe Bishop wants to ride shotgun, he's welcome, but I need to go to these callers who've been holding patiently.
[02:54:17.638 --> 02:54:31.028]  But if you look, I haven't even Googled my name today, I just did it during the break because I noticed the computer was still on over here where we've been doing it last night, seeing the coverage, and it says, what we learned from enduring a week-long news cycle about Alex Jones.
[02:54:31.028 --> 02:54:34.011]  And then what they learned is we're sitting there with the champagne toasting
[02:54:35.276 --> 02:54:39.599]  Because, wow, they really are that pathetic.
[02:54:39.599 --> 02:54:44.842]  I want to go to these calls, Al and others, but it's not that we're that good.
[02:54:44.842 --> 02:54:46.303]  I want to be clear.
[02:54:46.303 --> 02:54:47.284]  Pride go before a fall.
[02:54:47.284 --> 02:54:48.945]  It's that they're that pathetic.
[02:54:48.945 --> 02:54:56.670]  I mean, did you see geriatric Tom Brokaw come out calling me a racist again and then not showing proof?
[02:54:56.670 --> 02:54:57.951]  How unjournalistic.
[02:54:57.951 --> 02:55:01.153]  I mean, if I call somebody a racist, I'm going to show you the clip.
[02:55:01.153 --> 02:55:04.075]  Well, I thought it was hilarious, too, when she goes, she looks at Owen, she goes, so
[02:55:04.855 --> 02:55:06.035]  Do you consider yourself a journalist?
[02:55:06.035 --> 02:55:08.576]  You know, what do you do in the morning when you come into the office?
[02:55:08.576 --> 02:55:13.757]  He goes, well, I look at the news, I see what's going on, and then I kind of give my analysis on everything.
[02:55:13.757 --> 02:55:15.778]  That's still more than what she does!
[02:55:15.778 --> 02:55:21.259]  She wakes up in the morning, goes into an office, and someone goes, well, this is what you're going to say today, Megan, okay?
[02:55:21.259 --> 02:55:21.839]  Stick to script.
[02:55:21.839 --> 02:55:25.620]  And by the way, they were handing her written, printed out sheets.
[02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:31.142]  She had a notepad, but it was written stuff, and then she'd go talk to them, and then she'd come back, and then she'd get it real wrong.
[02:55:31.142 --> 02:55:32.322]  She'd go, in court!
[02:55:33.433 --> 02:55:37.185]  Your lawyer said, and you admitted, that you're nothing but an actor and it's all fake.
[02:55:38.325 --> 02:55:39.125]  Like Jack Nicholson.
[02:55:39.125 --> 02:55:47.430]  And I go, no, that was in a pre-trial hearing three weeks before when they wanted to enter into the trial a video of me acting crazy as a joker.
[02:55:47.430 --> 02:55:49.451]  He said, my client's being an actor there.
[02:55:49.451 --> 02:55:51.872]  He doesn't mean he wants to really kill kids, your honor.
[02:55:51.872 --> 02:55:53.773]  But the news didn't give the full quote.
[02:55:53.773 --> 02:55:59.055]  He's like, your honor, when he says he wants to murder the children by giving them fluoride and vaccines, he's against vaccines.
[02:55:59.055 --> 02:56:00.956]  He's playing.
[02:56:00.956 --> 02:56:01.837]  They were using that.
[02:56:01.837 --> 02:56:03.758]  And yes, I was being an actor.
[02:56:04.198 --> 02:56:06.258]  I mean, I'm dressed up like the Joker!
[02:56:06.258 --> 02:56:07.179]  It was satire.
[02:56:07.179 --> 02:56:09.479]  But it doesn't mean I'm being fake all the time.
[02:56:09.479 --> 02:56:10.379]  Yeah.
[02:56:10.379 --> 02:56:12.540]  But again, she had it all scrambled.
[02:56:12.540 --> 02:56:13.660]  Somebody else had written it.
[02:56:13.660 --> 02:56:14.940]  They were handing her pieces of paper.
[02:56:14.940 --> 02:56:20.982]  Well, I've got a lot of friends that are mainstream reporters and stuff that sit on there and they tell me they're disgusted by it.
[02:56:20.982 --> 02:56:28.563]  You know, they're waiting to get to a point where they can become financially stable to kind of move on and break off and work for something independent or alternative.
[02:56:28.563 --> 02:56:30.584]  That's a point Cernovich always makes when we're going to calls.
[02:56:31.044 --> 02:56:32.765]  He goes, Alex, you don't get it, because he talks to reporters.
[02:56:32.765 --> 02:56:33.505]  I really don't.
[02:56:33.505 --> 02:56:35.126]  They all want to be us.
[02:56:35.126 --> 02:56:37.387]  They all are watching us to learn how to be free.
[02:56:37.387 --> 02:56:46.232]  I could name some names that you'd be shocked that talk to me and hit me up on Twitter and call me, and I'm just sitting there like, wow, you seem like you're comfortable, like you're happy with what you're doing.
[02:56:46.232 --> 02:56:56.637]  And they're just like, no, when that camera goes off and we're done, I'm devastated, because I know I just lied, that I said something that I don't truly believe in, it doesn't go with my values, what I stand for.
[02:56:56.637 --> 02:56:57.658]  Oh yeah, they all look like...
[02:56:58.398 --> 02:57:08.647]  And they've even sent me screenshots of the scripts and I'll go, and I know someone that works at NBC as well, and I'll get the same script and I'll turn on the TV and I can read it word for word.
[02:57:08.647 --> 02:57:12.330]  And I could go to like an El Paso one or I could go to... Yeah, exactly.
[02:57:12.330 --> 02:57:16.633]  You think you're seeing, because I know people still trust local, most of that's pre-packaged.
[02:57:16.633 --> 02:57:17.834]  Alright, let's take a call here.
[02:57:17.834 --> 02:57:19.756]  I apologize to the callers for holding so long.
[02:57:19.756 --> 02:57:21.797]  Al in Michigan, then we'll go to O'Brien.
[02:57:21.797 --> 02:57:22.638]  Al, you're on the air.
[02:57:22.638 --> 02:57:24.299]  Welcome.
[02:57:24.299 --> 02:57:24.720]  Welcome.
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:27.521]  Nice to hear from you, Alex Jones.
[02:57:27.521 --> 02:57:30.002]  Thank you for calling in, brother.
[02:57:30.002 --> 02:57:35.705]  Well, a month ago, I got the Living Defense and went on the cleanse for a month.
[02:57:35.705 --> 02:57:45.090]  And the last week of the cleanse, I threw in the Oxy Powder, and I took advantage of your Memorial Day sale and got about 10 other products.
[02:57:45.090 --> 02:57:50.553]  And then I went to my doctor's physical, and he recommended I don't take any of them.
[02:57:50.553 --> 02:57:54.075]  And I don't know why.
[02:57:55.254 --> 02:57:58.815]  He said he's not sure what some of this stuff is.
[02:57:58.815 --> 02:58:00.876]  Well, there's probably a negative side effect.
[02:58:00.876 --> 02:58:05.478]  This is a great example of how we don't screen calls and how our testimonies are real, because this is a negative one.
[02:58:05.478 --> 02:58:06.158]  It's a unicorn.
[02:58:06.158 --> 02:58:07.559]  It's a very, very rare effect.
[02:58:07.559 --> 02:58:11.140]  Sure, we follow what they call FDA grass.
[02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:14.021]  That's the name of the law that was passed in the 90s.
[02:58:14.021 --> 02:58:18.263]  It's only certified to be absolutely safe and good for you.
[02:58:18.263 --> 02:58:20.383]  So we only use grass ingredients.
[02:58:20.383 --> 02:58:23.765]  Then they're also tested and made by top labs in the country.
[02:58:24.945 --> 02:58:27.886]  Now, a lot of doctors say don't take supplements.
[02:58:27.886 --> 02:58:29.086]  That's part of the cult.
[02:58:29.086 --> 02:58:32.827]  You know, you see the ads on NBC for Prozac and, you know, whiskey.
[02:58:32.827 --> 02:58:41.908]  That's okay, but then don't take, you know, something like Bio-PQQ that the Japanese are obsessed with, that's been proven to have nerve, you know, regrowth factor.
[02:58:41.908 --> 02:58:45.409]  So, so, but, but, but listen, Al, I really appreciate your support.
[02:58:45.409 --> 02:58:49.250]  I'd love to come back to you and hear exactly what you're getting at, if you can form a sentence.
[02:58:51.232 --> 02:58:58.718]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[02:59:53.127 --> 02:59:55.729]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:02.409 --> 03:00:09.015]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:21.347 --> 03:00:26.988]  Alright, if the caller can get a sentence out without the music coming on or the break coming on or me interrupting, let me get a word in edgewise.
[03:00:26.988 --> 03:00:28.709]  He'll be able to make his point.
[03:00:28.709 --> 03:00:29.489]  Is he being positive?
[03:00:29.489 --> 03:00:30.249]  Is he being negative?
[03:00:30.249 --> 03:00:30.989]  I don't know.
[03:00:30.989 --> 03:00:31.949]  I'm not rapping about the caller.
[03:00:31.949 --> 03:00:32.529]  I'm positive.
[03:00:32.529 --> 03:00:33.270]  No, no, no.
[03:00:33.270 --> 03:00:33.770]  Hold on.
[03:00:33.770 --> 03:00:34.450]  You sound like a great guy.
[03:00:34.450 --> 03:00:36.950]  I'm apologizing for the music and everything else cutting in.
[03:00:36.950 --> 03:00:38.371]  I went to your call too late.
[03:00:38.371 --> 03:00:39.731]  I was getting mad at the doctor, not you.
[03:00:39.731 --> 03:00:40.311]  I apologize.
[03:00:40.311 --> 03:00:42.871]  Go ahead.
[03:00:42.871 --> 03:00:44.072]  2005, my life changed.
[03:00:44.072 --> 03:00:48.673]  My parents felt I was depressed, so they took me to the doctor.
[03:00:48.673 --> 03:00:49.993]  They put me on Paxil.
[03:00:50.785 --> 03:00:59.870]  That put me into a manic state, and so now I'm bipolar, and I'm on six meds, and I've had four hospitalizations.
[03:00:59.870 --> 03:01:01.992]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that, brother.
[03:01:01.992 --> 03:01:07.415]  So the doctor is more concerned about how they might react with my meds, and I'm fine taking the meds.
[03:01:07.415 --> 03:01:12.658]  I can handle the chemical warfare, and I started listening.
[03:01:12.658 --> 03:01:15.739]  My last hospitalization was 2011.
[03:01:15.739 --> 03:01:17.480]  I started listening to you in 2012, and
[03:01:20.905 --> 03:01:26.649]  You really give a voice to people who feel like they're alone and think they're the only ones who are thinking these things.
[03:01:26.649 --> 03:01:30.311]  You really give a voice to those kind of people.
[03:01:30.311 --> 03:01:40.218]  You let them know they're not alone and that they can not feel like they have to do all the work of waking up everyone around them, that there are people actually awake.
[03:01:42.295 --> 03:01:43.236]  Well, I appreciate you.
[03:01:43.236 --> 03:01:46.159]  You know, we just try our best to fund our operation with good things.
[03:01:46.159 --> 03:01:49.563]  I get a chip on my shoulder sometimes when doctors criticize things.
[03:01:49.563 --> 03:01:53.648]  When I know for a fact that my finger got cut off, they reattached it.
[03:01:53.648 --> 03:01:57.933]  It didn't have all the feeling in it on one side until I took...
[03:01:59.096 --> 03:02:00.456]  DNA Force.
[03:02:00.456 --> 03:02:04.437]  And then literally in three months, it tangled, it hurt, the feeling came back.
[03:02:04.437 --> 03:02:09.898]  The problem is you start taking DNA Force with the Bio-PQQ, we have the true Bio-PQQ, not the fake stuff.
[03:02:09.898 --> 03:02:11.739]  Ours is from an organic source.
[03:02:11.739 --> 03:02:14.459]  Doesn't mean it's organic, because you can't certify it.
[03:02:14.459 --> 03:02:16.439]  It's genetically engineered bacteria that make it.
[03:02:16.439 --> 03:02:20.100]  But the Japanese have the patent and you have really back pain and stuff that's gone away.
[03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:23.621]  You start taking it, old injuries come back because it's actually healing.
[03:02:23.621 --> 03:02:26.622]  Now you can actually say that about Bio-PQQ, so it's amazing.
[03:02:26.622 --> 03:02:28.622]  What happened to you though on the supplements?
[03:02:31.098 --> 03:02:34.941]  Um, no, I haven't been on them terribly too long to notice enough.
[03:02:34.941 --> 03:02:40.004]  Uh, the iodine I love, I would take it just for the taste, even if it did nothing.
[03:02:40.004 --> 03:02:42.826]  It tastes excellent.
[03:02:42.826 --> 03:02:46.069]  But I also wanted to talk about January 20th.
[03:02:46.069 --> 03:02:47.330]  I got what I wanted.
[03:02:47.330 --> 03:02:48.951]  Trump became president.
[03:02:48.951 --> 03:02:54.315]  I was an alcoholic for 10 years and I quit drinking January 20th.
[03:02:54.315 --> 03:02:56.436]  And that's what made me start taking your supplements.
[03:02:56.436 --> 03:02:57.377]  I started spending
[03:02:58.072 --> 03:03:01.113]  The money that I would spend on alcohol on your supplement.
[03:03:01.113 --> 03:03:06.835]  Well, brother, congratulations, and if something's tasting good to you, that means you probably got a deficiency.
[03:03:06.835 --> 03:03:09.176]  When I've gotten enough of the iodine, it doesn't taste good.
[03:03:09.176 --> 03:03:11.217]  When I'm really needing it, it tastes really, really good.
[03:03:11.217 --> 03:03:14.178]  God bless you, and thank you for all your help, Al.
[03:03:14.178 --> 03:03:15.759]  All of you make this broadcast possible.
[03:03:15.759 --> 03:03:17.840]  Believe me, this is a very rare organization.
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:19.940]  The Globals are very, very upset about it.
[03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:22.361]  They're very, very upset about what we're doing.
[03:03:22.361 --> 03:03:25.863]  Joe Biggs, in your gut, do you think Trump's going to survive?
[03:03:25.863 --> 03:03:26.103]  Yeah.
[03:03:26.863 --> 03:03:27.883]  You know, we're behind them.
[03:03:27.883 --> 03:03:29.384]  A lot of people are, man.
[03:03:29.384 --> 03:03:31.445]  I go out here on the streets, I talk to people.
[03:03:31.445 --> 03:03:32.225]  You'd be surprised.
[03:03:32.225 --> 03:03:37.388]  I was at a gas station yesterday and some guy comes up to me and goes, hey, I like Trump.
[03:03:37.388 --> 03:03:40.429]  You know, there's a lot, there's behind every blade of grass.
[03:03:40.429 --> 03:03:42.230]  And we have to make it okay.
[03:03:42.230 --> 03:03:47.372]  I mean, here's the thing, you know, we knew last year during the election cycle that they were hammering Trump.
[03:03:47.372 --> 03:03:49.593]  They were going after him hardcore on every little issue.
[03:03:49.593 --> 03:03:52.014]  The Russia thing's been there since the beginning.
[03:03:52.014 --> 03:03:53.215]  We should just be used to that by now.
[03:03:54.235 --> 03:03:55.456]  Ignore it and move on.
[03:03:55.456 --> 03:03:59.601]  And that's one thing I want, you know, our president to understand is, hey, there's going to be bad stuff in the news.
[03:03:59.601 --> 03:04:00.682]  You already know that's going to happen.
[03:04:00.682 --> 03:04:03.645]  It happened last year when you were running to be president.
[03:04:03.645 --> 03:04:04.526]  Ignore it.
[03:04:04.526 --> 03:04:05.507]  Just do your agenda.
[03:04:05.507 --> 03:04:06.928]  He just knows it's pure crap.
[03:04:06.928 --> 03:04:08.430]  All he's doing is helping our country.
[03:04:08.430 --> 03:04:09.971]  I know, I know.
[03:04:09.971 --> 03:04:11.112]  When you have an ego...
[03:04:11.713 --> 03:04:14.555]  It bothers you because you know it's not true and you don't want to see it.
[03:04:14.555 --> 03:04:17.597]  But I just say my advice to him is to buckle down.
[03:04:17.597 --> 03:04:17.917]  No, no, no.
[03:04:17.917 --> 03:04:21.379]  He's mad about it because he can't talk to any of his old friends.
[03:04:21.379 --> 03:04:25.642]  They say don't talk to a bunch of people because they say we're Russian agents.
[03:04:25.642 --> 03:04:26.942]  And they mess with him.
[03:04:26.942 --> 03:04:28.884]  He's got to answer questions about it.
[03:04:28.884 --> 03:04:37.889]  He's like, are the Russians going to turn coal back on and boost the stock market $3 trillion and $300 billion in jobs and secure the border and return the military and try to fix the VA?
[03:04:37.889 --> 03:04:38.770]  It's not his ego.
[03:04:38.770 --> 03:04:40.351]  He's mad that he's traitors.
[03:04:41.175 --> 03:04:41.596]  He's gonna do it.
[03:04:41.596 --> 03:04:42.356]  We're gonna be fine.
[03:04:42.356 --> 03:04:43.458]  He has all the intel, too.
[03:04:43.458 --> 03:04:44.759]  He knows that they were paid off.
[03:04:44.759 --> 03:04:47.522]  So he's telling Sessions to arrest these people and, you know, it's not happening.
[03:04:47.522 --> 03:04:49.344]  Hey, thank you so much, Last Caller.
[03:04:49.344 --> 03:04:51.927]  O'Brien, Joseph, Eric, we're gonna get to you.
[03:04:51.927 --> 03:04:52.688]  You're true troopers.
[03:04:52.688 --> 03:04:54.310]  And Mike Cernovich is coming in.
[03:04:54.310 --> 03:04:56.693]  He'll be hosting this hour as we ride shotgun.
[03:04:56.693 --> 03:04:57.894]  InfoWars.com.
[03:05:01.078 --> 03:05:05.399]  Lost in the constant fake news cycle, we have forgotten the building tensions in Syria.
[03:05:05.399 --> 03:05:10.681]  Until this morning, when news broke of a Syrian Army plane being shot down by a United States F-18.
[03:05:10.681 --> 03:05:15.383]  This is the first Syrian aircraft to have been downed by the United States since 2011.
[03:05:15.383 --> 03:05:22.825]  Washington justified the strike, claiming the jet dropped bombs near U.S.-backed forces, while officials from Damascus said they were attacking ISIS.
[03:05:22.825 --> 03:05:25.566]  Truth be told, these are most likely the same group.
[03:05:25.566 --> 03:05:28.387]  But we should be asking John McCain that question.
[03:05:28.567 --> 03:05:31.250]  Russia has responded by saying it will now treat U.S.
[03:05:31.250 --> 03:05:33.993]  aircraft operating in Syria as targets.
[03:05:33.993 --> 03:05:39.639]  President Trump can't get a microphone loud enough to ask for the Russia collusion investigation to be over.
[03:05:39.639 --> 03:05:43.644]  But don't hold your breath on the Democrats finding common sense and logic overnight.
[03:05:43.644 --> 03:05:46.387]  President Trump will still be investigated for collusion with Russia.
[03:05:46.607 --> 03:05:48.889]  While they are threatening him and our country.
[03:05:48.889 --> 03:05:56.273]  President Trump, the globalists are trying to trap you and trick you into a war in Syria in hopes it will cost you the 2020 election.
[03:05:56.273 --> 03:05:57.114]  Don't fall for it.
[03:05:57.114 --> 03:05:58.435]  Make America great again.
[03:05:58.435 --> 03:06:00.796]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:06:00.796 --> 03:06:11.243]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:06:11.383 --> 03:06:13.446]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:06:13.446 --> 03:06:16.310]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:06:16.310 --> 03:06:17.792]  It's made in the USA.
[03:06:17.792 --> 03:06:24.641]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:06:24.641 --> 03:06:25.903]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:06:26.704 --> 03:06:36.408]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:06:36.408 --> 03:06:53.215]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:06:53.215 --> 03:06:56.376]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:06:56.516 --> 03:07:00.577]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:00.577 --> 03:07:02.498]  Embrix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[03:07:02.498 --> 03:07:14.681]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[03:07:14.941 --> 03:07:24.093]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[03:07:24.093 --> 03:07:28.740]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[03:07:28.740 --> 03:07:31.163]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman,
[03:07:31.563 --> 03:07:35.844]  20% off retail, sign up for auto ship, an additional 25% off.
[03:07:35.844 --> 03:07:36.984]  It's all there.
[03:07:36.984 --> 03:07:42.425]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[03:07:42.425 --> 03:07:53.167]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:07:53.167 --> 03:07:55.767]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[03:07:55.767 --> 03:07:59.828]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[03:08:16.252 --> 03:08:18.917]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:18.917 --> 03:08:24.047]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:32.079 --> 03:08:35.201]  All right, Mike Cernovich and Joe Biggs are going to host this hour.
[03:08:35.201 --> 03:08:38.503]  Joe Biggs is going to be here Wednesday hosting.
[03:08:38.503 --> 03:08:42.906]  I'm going to take off tomorrow and the next day because all I think about is work.
[03:08:42.906 --> 03:08:45.388]  All I do is work and I'm just like a race car.
[03:08:45.388 --> 03:08:53.313]  I've got to turn the engine off at least for two days and make myself do that because my children want to go hiking and swimming and hanging out and they're off school right now.
[03:08:53.313 --> 03:08:53.834]  So I'm going to do it.
[03:08:54.494 --> 03:08:56.357]  I'm going to not watch the news, though it's impossible.
[03:08:56.357 --> 03:08:57.619]  I know you'll be tuned in.
[03:08:57.619 --> 03:09:02.606]  But, you know, it's important for you as well to take time off, too, and, you know, not focus on this.
[03:09:02.606 --> 03:09:09.356]  But also then, when you are engaged, be in the info war, because it's exciting, it's fun, but we all need balance.
[03:09:09.356 --> 03:09:10.077]  But here's an example.
[03:09:11.038 --> 03:09:12.138]  We launched this three weeks ago.
[03:09:12.138 --> 03:09:13.619]  It was Mike Cernovich's idea.
[03:09:13.619 --> 03:09:25.082]  I put $200,000, I hardly have, behind it saying CNN is ISIS because they keep backing Al Qaeda, they keep backing Arab Spring, they keep backing overthrowing Assad for these people.
[03:09:25.082 --> 03:09:29.403]  And yeah, the second guy that got arrested last night, CNN is ISIS.
[03:09:29.403 --> 03:09:31.644]  He's going to win $2,500.
[03:09:31.644 --> 03:09:31.784]  Wow.
[03:09:31.784 --> 03:09:34.864]  You know, the highest level award is $200,000, $2,500.
[03:09:34.864 --> 03:09:40.086]  You usually have to get Infowars.com out and do it in a legal and lawful area.
[03:09:41.331 --> 03:09:47.453]  I have to say, I cannot pay out to anybody else that rushes up on a stage or does something that they can claim violates private property.
[03:09:47.453 --> 03:09:58.957]  I'm doing this, you know, kind of posthumously because I'm saying, do this where they're doing public video shoots or do this where they're talking to man on the street or calling to C-SPAN or whatever you have to.
[03:09:58.957 --> 03:10:04.419]  But posthumously, and not that he's dead, but you know, after the event, I can say that, okay, you're going to get the award.
[03:10:04.419 --> 03:10:05.900]  But going forward,
[03:10:07.108 --> 03:10:13.153]  Anybody in Shakespeare in the Park, or any other event where it's private property, if you get up and speak out, that's fine.
[03:10:13.153 --> 03:10:22.982]  I think rushing up on stage while I commend it, there becomes some liability issues if we sit there and say, now the left's all violent, George Soros is out there funding groups saying kill cops, he gets away with it.
[03:10:22.982 --> 03:10:23.923]  I don't want violence.
[03:10:24.443 --> 03:10:25.444]  And this could lead to that.
[03:10:25.444 --> 03:10:27.545]  So I think this this crosses the line.
[03:10:27.545 --> 03:10:29.026]  Now, one side of me commends you.
[03:10:29.026 --> 03:10:30.087]  I think you're awesome.
[03:10:30.087 --> 03:10:36.311]  And so I'm going to pay you $2,500, not for the contest, but but just in general for courage.
[03:10:36.311 --> 03:10:38.933]  OK, but the contest, you got to follow the laws.
[03:10:38.933 --> 03:10:39.573]  You got to do it.
[03:10:39.573 --> 03:10:40.474]  There's ways to do it.
[03:10:40.474 --> 03:10:42.275]  The Bill Clinton's a rapist event.
[03:10:42.275 --> 03:10:47.278]  That was the model when these globalists go out to public events or Democrats have town halls.
[03:10:47.278 --> 03:10:49.580]  That's when you get up to the mic with your shirt.
[03:10:49.580 --> 03:10:51.241]  We sell the Infowars.
[03:10:51.241 --> 03:10:53.382]  CNN is ISIS or you can do anything.
[03:10:53.382 --> 03:10:53.963]  You know, the guy that
[03:10:55.364 --> 03:10:55.604]  Yeah.
[03:11:11.895 --> 03:11:15.838]  And basically applauding the great service they've done in the Info War.
[03:11:15.838 --> 03:11:18.420]  The Democrats are saying murder everybody, kill Trump.
[03:11:18.420 --> 03:11:20.281]  All we're saying is stop the violence.
[03:11:20.281 --> 03:11:22.043]  Stop the violence like Ted Nugent said.
[03:11:22.043 --> 03:11:26.706]  It's dangerous because what this play is doing, this is telling people it's okay to speak like that.
[03:11:26.706 --> 03:11:30.028]  It's okay to run around and say, hey, let's go kill the president.
[03:11:30.028 --> 03:11:32.150]  They're sharing the simulated murder.
[03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:37.274]  And I say this for a reason because my good friend and I went out, he took me out Saturday night for Father's Day or whatever.
[03:11:37.794 --> 03:11:37.954]  I don't
[03:11:53.789 --> 03:11:58.172]  I'm going to kill that mother... And they just start going, oh yeah, I'd like to kill him too.
[03:11:58.172 --> 03:11:59.053]  I'd like to see him dead.
[03:11:59.053 --> 03:12:04.436]  And it's funny because you see these liberal news sources coming out and saying, oh, this plan isn't promoting them.
[03:12:04.436 --> 03:12:07.158]  It's not going to have an effect on people out there.
[03:12:07.158 --> 03:12:09.179]  Well, the rest of the media is saying kill everybody.
[03:12:09.179 --> 03:12:09.960]  It's clearly Trump.
[03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:11.581]  American flags, orange hair.
[03:12:11.581 --> 03:12:13.502]  He has the Eastern European wife.
[03:12:13.502 --> 03:12:14.903]  He looks like Melania.
[03:12:14.903 --> 03:12:16.584]  It's a total plan.
[03:12:16.584 --> 03:12:19.086]  By the way, we have the video with the audio.
[03:12:19.086 --> 03:12:20.787]  Let's go ahead and roll that right now and we'll go to your calls.
[03:12:27.157 --> 03:12:30.238]  Amazing.
[03:12:30.238 --> 03:12:33.619]  Okay, it's $2,500.
[03:12:33.619 --> 03:12:35.340]  Amazing.
[03:12:35.340 --> 03:12:36.661]  And notice how they tackle him.
[03:12:36.661 --> 03:12:43.064]  I've never seen a left-wing... If that had happened at a Trump rally and they tackled him like this, that would be the biggest story in the world.
[03:12:43.064 --> 03:12:49.967]  It'd be Trump violent thugs, even though their own Wikileaks say, go be violent, go kick people in the leg, so it's not on tape, have them hit you.
[03:12:50.447 --> 03:12:53.429]  Well, whoever this guy is, and by the way, we're not just going to have awards.
[03:12:53.429 --> 03:12:56.551]  Some people here who've won awards end up being reporters for us.
[03:12:56.551 --> 03:12:58.953]  These are the type of folks we want that have this courage.
[03:12:58.953 --> 03:13:07.019]  Yeah, that's what I've been telling, so his name is Saul, and he's a Proud Boys, friends with Gavin McInnes, and he went into that, so Gavin texted me that photo earlier.
[03:13:07.019 --> 03:13:10.842]  But yeah, I love how he gets tackled, even though he wasn't violent.
[03:13:10.842 --> 03:13:11.962]  That should be a big story.
[03:13:11.962 --> 03:13:13.003]  The media is a double standard.
[03:13:13.003 --> 03:13:13.944]  I love Gavin McInnes.
[03:13:14.564 --> 03:13:17.085]  Yeah, so this is to an audition.
[03:13:17.085 --> 03:13:18.806]  People always say, I want to work for you.
[03:13:18.806 --> 03:13:21.867]  How do I get, get me to Alex, get me to say, where's your portfolio?
[03:13:21.867 --> 03:13:23.528]  Why aren't you in the field doing news?
[03:13:23.528 --> 03:13:30.670]  Why aren't you out there every day doing videos, doing podcasts, doing blogs, raising awareness like Saul did, like Laura Loomer did?
[03:13:30.670 --> 03:13:34.192]  There's nothing stopping anyone here who's listening in to join the InfoWire.
[03:13:34.192 --> 03:13:35.872]  It's free to open up a YouTube account.
[03:13:35.872 --> 03:13:36.913]  It's free to start a Twitter.
[03:13:36.913 --> 03:13:38.093]  It's free to start a Facebook.
[03:13:38.093 --> 03:13:42.115]  All you need now is a phone with a camera and the balls to go out there and do it.
[03:13:42.395 --> 03:13:43.736]  And be sick of being pushed around.
[03:13:43.736 --> 03:13:47.977]  Okay, these guys have been holding so long, that's why I crashed into this hour that Cernovich is here hosting.
[03:13:47.977 --> 03:13:57.701]  And again, I do everything I say I'm going to do, but I can tell Joe Biggs had so much energy, was doing so much stuff, that I just said, Joe, you need to go do your own thing.
[03:13:57.701 --> 03:14:02.243]  And once that's successful, which I thought it would be, I said, then I'm going to launch some big stuff down the road.
[03:14:02.243 --> 03:14:04.664]  Hopefully you can come back and synergistically work with us.
[03:14:04.664 --> 03:14:06.045]  So you're doing your own thing on your own show.
[03:14:06.585 --> 03:14:09.508]  And now Joe's to that point, he's been successful, so now he's back.
[03:14:09.508 --> 03:14:13.531]  Plus he's been taking care of his baby the last few months, which I've done with another newborn.
[03:14:13.531 --> 03:14:15.493]  I know how it is, the fourth in the family.
[03:14:15.493 --> 03:14:17.474]  A true blessing, and my children are with me.
[03:14:17.474 --> 03:14:19.216]  Fake news is all, you know, lying about that.
[03:14:19.216 --> 03:14:25.982]  But I'm about to launch a TV slash network, but the base will be affiliates, talk radio.
[03:14:26.602 --> 03:14:28.004]  And these affiliates love us.
[03:14:28.004 --> 03:14:29.806]  I have over 200.
[03:14:29.806 --> 03:14:35.593]  I guarantee you they are so ready, our affiliates, to pick up you guys on hundreds of stations, I think, right away.
[03:14:35.593 --> 03:14:37.576]  This is going to be so huge.
[03:14:37.576 --> 03:14:40.259]  And then we'll go viral over the internet and the live streams.
[03:14:40.259 --> 03:14:43.824]  And when the audiences all get behind this, we're not in competition with the rebel.
[03:14:44.184 --> 03:14:46.325]  We're not in competition with the compound media.
[03:14:46.325 --> 03:14:48.005]  You can have all those guys on.
[03:14:48.005 --> 03:14:49.646]  You can have shows on there if you want.
[03:14:49.646 --> 03:14:50.166]  I don't care.
[03:14:50.166 --> 03:14:56.108]  I want to build a mass of awakened people that focus like a laser beam and take down the NWO.
[03:14:56.108 --> 03:14:56.968]  It's about to happen.
[03:14:56.968 --> 03:15:03.910]  Well, and it's like the article in the Washington Post said, even though it's a little bit negative, they go, we're drowning out the media with sheer volume.
[03:15:03.910 --> 03:15:07.311]  Towards the bottom of the article, they go, they admit that we're winning.
[03:15:07.311 --> 03:15:08.472]  That's with the champagne.
[03:15:08.472 --> 03:15:11.793]  Yeah, so there's this champagne toasting, of course, with Andrew Torba.
[03:15:12.373 --> 03:15:21.664]  And somebody actually, again, a liberal journalist had commented that they had to trot out the cryptkeeper Tom Brokaw, or Tom Rather, whatever his name is.
[03:15:21.664 --> 03:15:25.349]  Meanwhile... Yeah, rolling out some liar to call me a racist?
[03:15:25.349 --> 03:15:26.330]  Yeah, that's the future.
[03:15:26.330 --> 03:15:27.952]  What, like the KKK wants to kill me?
[03:15:28.112 --> 03:15:34.138]  Well, think about, like I said earlier, there's so many journalists out there who are established right now in the media that hate their lives.
[03:15:34.138 --> 03:15:36.680]  They hate doing what they're doing, but they're trying to get that money.
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:41.705]  They're trying to get that bankroll so they can, you know, kind of secure an area where they can go and do what they want to do.
[03:15:41.705 --> 03:15:45.488]  And you launch a network like that, you're going to be surprised at the amount of people that are going to come out here.
[03:15:45.488 --> 03:15:48.751]  David, they go, if you watch Jones for a week, watch out, he'll have you believe in him.
[03:15:52.202 --> 03:15:53.062]  It's ridiculous.
[03:15:53.062 --> 03:15:56.704]  You read these articles, you can see, like, they're going as far as they can without getting fired.
[03:15:56.704 --> 03:16:00.926]  Yeah, and, well, they admit that this is more fun what we do.
[03:16:00.926 --> 03:16:03.527]  They're younger people, they love the streaming content.
[03:16:03.527 --> 03:16:07.049]  You know, they're at work, they're listening in, they watch... Skip this break.
[03:16:07.049 --> 03:16:08.870]  Yeah, they don't like the edited crap.
[03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:10.931]  And they want to be in control.
[03:16:10.931 --> 03:16:13.072]  They want to be running their own media operation.
[03:16:13.072 --> 03:16:14.273]  It doesn't mean they even agree with us.
[03:16:14.273 --> 03:16:17.414]  Did you see the rest of the Megyn Kelly show last night?
[03:16:17.414 --> 03:16:18.234]  It was boring.
[03:16:18.234 --> 03:16:19.055]  It was boring.
[03:16:19.055 --> 03:16:21.216]  I'm not against old people, I love old folks, but did you notice that
[03:16:21.736 --> 03:16:24.077]  It was like a geriatric home for fake journalists.
[03:16:42.662 --> 03:17:01.815]  Yeah, and that's the thing that a lot of people are realizing too, and I don't want to throw shade on Breitbart or whatever, but the younger people are realizing now that media is going to be based around your personality, around your personal brand, around your identity, and the old byline, oh I'm on NBC therefore you're going to take me seriously, all that is dead.
[03:17:01.815 --> 03:17:02.716]  The brand is dead.
[03:17:02.716 --> 03:17:04.957]  The Washington Post brand is not trusted.
[03:17:04.957 --> 03:17:06.358]  The New York Times brand is not trusted.
[03:17:06.358 --> 03:17:07.339]  It's all these young people
[03:17:07.879 --> 03:17:12.243]  Are tuning in, these journalists, even though they disagree with us and think we're, you know, whatever.
[03:17:12.243 --> 03:17:15.365]  They're saying, I want to have my own brand, my own audience.
[03:17:15.365 --> 03:17:17.046]  By the way, good job for Sean Hannity.
[03:17:17.046 --> 03:17:19.348]  He said, hey, release the whole tape.
[03:17:19.348 --> 03:17:21.009]  It's obviously a cover-up.
[03:17:21.009 --> 03:17:21.350]  Right.
[03:17:21.350 --> 03:17:22.791]  Wait till we do.
[03:17:22.791 --> 03:17:24.332]  The problem is people say that.
[03:17:24.332 --> 03:17:26.413]  That's a lot to release.
[03:17:26.413 --> 03:17:28.375]  Don't do it.
[03:17:28.375 --> 03:17:32.798]  Don't subject anybody to have to listen to Megyn Kelly any longer.
[03:17:32.798 --> 03:17:33.619]  The corpse is gone.
[03:17:33.619 --> 03:17:34.359]  It's right there.
[03:17:35.236 --> 03:17:36.456]  We've autopsied her.
[03:17:36.456 --> 03:17:39.197]  I mean, I wonder how long it's going to be before they just can her.
[03:17:39.197 --> 03:17:40.878]  No, but I mean, I said I was going to release it.
[03:17:40.878 --> 03:17:41.818]  I have to.
[03:17:41.818 --> 03:17:43.179]  There's still little bits here and there.
[03:17:43.179 --> 03:17:44.399]  Dude, look at Jesse Ventura.
[03:17:44.399 --> 03:17:45.459]  I like Jesse.
[03:17:45.459 --> 03:17:47.200]  Governor of Indiana.
[03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:53.222]  He has a show on Raw story about how Dick Cheney's evil.
[03:17:53.222 --> 03:17:55.203]  Tell us something we don't know, man.
[03:17:55.203 --> 03:17:56.843]  Cover what's happening currently.
[03:17:56.843 --> 03:18:00.404]  And then JFK, they killed him.
[03:18:00.404 --> 03:18:01.445]  We didn't know that.
[03:18:02.265 --> 03:18:06.048]  I'm down in Mexico right now, Alex, okay?
[03:18:06.048 --> 03:18:08.369]  I was the governor of Minnesota.
[03:18:08.369 --> 03:18:10.090]  I was a Navy SEAL.
[03:18:10.090 --> 03:18:12.392]  I was the original frog man.
[03:18:12.392 --> 03:18:17.095]  Too many people living in the past, I mean, you even hear this with a lot of people in journalism, like, well, I knew Andrew Breitbart.
[03:18:17.095 --> 03:18:19.017]  And I'm like, well, okay, cool story, bro.
[03:18:19.017 --> 03:18:19.957]  What have you done?
[03:18:19.957 --> 03:18:21.138]  What have you done this past week?
[03:18:21.138 --> 03:18:23.880]  Well, Andrew Breitbart was a friend of mine, therefore, you should listen to me.
[03:18:23.880 --> 03:18:25.361]  Let's talk about the real MVP.
[03:18:25.361 --> 03:18:28.343]  Let's skip this break and the one of 50, because we can do that.
[03:18:28.343 --> 03:18:30.324]  And then I've got to go to O'Brien and Joseph and Eric.
[03:18:30.324 --> 03:18:31.105]  I promise I'm going to them.
[03:18:32.202 --> 03:18:44.511]  Drudge has been the quiet kingmaker in all this, because Drudge, early on, mainstream, alternative, government docs, foreign news, he would link to whatever he thought was interesting and actually gave oxygen to things early on.
[03:18:44.511 --> 03:18:45.932]  And look, he's covering the important news.
[03:18:45.932 --> 03:18:50.176]  Russia vows to shoot down all flying objects over Syria, warns USA.
[03:18:50.176 --> 03:18:59.563]  Yeah, that's a US-Russia, now in Cuban Missile Crisis level showdown, because criminal elements inside the Pentagon want to start a larger war to take control from Trump.
[03:19:00.023 --> 03:19:03.744]  So they're using his biggest strength, that he loves the military, as his weakness.
[03:19:03.744 --> 03:19:04.984]  So he's put the military in charge.
[03:19:04.984 --> 03:19:09.785]  You know, I learned early on, before it was in the news, Trump walked in on January 20th.
[03:19:09.785 --> 03:19:11.205]  He went to the CIA.
[03:19:11.205 --> 03:19:14.146]  Remember, that's the first place he went.
[03:19:14.146 --> 03:19:18.567]  And he said, give me all the lists of targets you already called to be hit.
[03:19:18.567 --> 03:19:19.447]  They said, here they are, sir.
[03:19:19.447 --> 03:19:21.288]  And he said, I don't want to look at them.
[03:19:21.288 --> 03:19:21.868]  Hit them all.
[03:19:21.868 --> 03:19:22.248]  And they did.
[03:19:23.174 --> 03:19:25.616]  And so that's a strength that he's delegating and a promise.
[03:19:25.616 --> 03:19:32.601]  So he's in control, but then they can use that as ways to then insert things like a Bay of Pigs on Kennedy.
[03:19:32.601 --> 03:19:36.825]  That was a mission where they set Kennedy up by blowing the mission to make the president look bad.
[03:19:37.779 --> 03:19:38.179]  Exactly.
[03:19:55.320 --> 03:19:58.321]  Well, that's World War III.
[03:19:58.321 --> 03:19:59.581]  We all know the end play.
[03:19:59.581 --> 03:20:04.243]  Yeah, they're manipulating intelligence supports already and nothing can be trusted.
[03:20:04.243 --> 03:20:05.943]  Trump delegated a lot.
[03:20:05.943 --> 03:20:09.885]  There will be a Gulf of Tonkin style incident to drag us into another one.
[03:20:09.885 --> 03:20:11.265]  Well, they're trying right now!
[03:20:11.265 --> 03:20:14.786]  And by the way, you heard CENTCOM calling in and all the rest of it.
[03:20:14.786 --> 03:20:16.107]  I mean, I have my sources.
[03:20:16.107 --> 03:20:22.929]  They say no one in the CIA, no one in Defense Intelligence, nobody in the Northern Command, Southern Command, Space Command.
[03:20:24.069 --> 03:20:29.973]  The rank and file, even the officers are against it, except for a few weird old generals on the top, and most of them don't want this to happen.
[03:20:29.973 --> 03:20:32.915]  So, that's the globalist's big problem.
[03:20:32.915 --> 03:20:33.315]  What do you think?
[03:20:33.315 --> 03:20:36.417]  I think it's going to be interesting.
[03:20:36.417 --> 03:20:41.440]  I think that there will be something that's pulled to try to get us to go into war, but, you know, at the end of the day, you know...
[03:20:43.581 --> 03:20:45.102]  Mad Dog Mattis has a pretty good record.
[03:20:45.102 --> 03:20:53.805]  I'm hoping that he's going to stick to his guns, he's going to stick to doing the right thing, and focus merely on destroying those ISIS elements that are out there, those pockets of... I agree.
[03:20:53.805 --> 03:20:57.866]  So why are we blowing up armored columns, and why are we shooting down Syrian planes?
[03:20:57.866 --> 03:21:00.827]  That's, that kind of shady stuff's been going on for a long time.
[03:21:00.827 --> 03:21:06.769]  I mean, shouldn't we be cheering Syrian pilots with, you know, they got shorter beards than you, and they're like, the women can go to college, and... Yeah.
[03:21:07.810 --> 03:21:12.553]  Well, again, they are manipulating intelligence reports.
[03:21:12.553 --> 03:21:13.874]  That's, again, McMaster.
[03:21:13.874 --> 03:21:14.955]  He wants this war.
[03:21:14.955 --> 03:21:16.516]  All he understands is armor.
[03:21:16.516 --> 03:21:18.598]  He doesn't understand the information war.
[03:21:18.598 --> 03:21:24.362]  He understands drop armor, drop howitzers, let's bring in tanks, let's destroy more homes.
[03:21:24.362 --> 03:21:25.383]  And that's what they want.
[03:21:25.383 --> 03:21:28.845]  Petraeus wants it, of course, too, because he makes all the money in the country.
[03:21:28.845 --> 03:21:32.088]  Well, I don't want a war with Saudi Arabia, but, I mean, Syria's not been our business.
[03:21:32.688 --> 03:21:35.329]  Saudi Arabia has been up our rear end.
[03:21:35.329 --> 03:21:36.710]  We want to use some howitzers and stuff.
[03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:37.490]  How about on them?
[03:21:37.490 --> 03:21:39.171]  Oh, I would love to go to war with Saudi Arabia.
[03:21:39.171 --> 03:21:41.792]  No, I've said that that's one war I would support.
[03:21:41.792 --> 03:21:43.532]  Let's go to Saudi Arabia, take their oil.
[03:21:43.532 --> 03:21:46.073]  I would 100% support a war with Saudi Arabia.
[03:21:46.073 --> 03:21:48.794]  Well, I'm just saying, they're the ones attacking everybody.
[03:21:48.794 --> 03:21:50.675]  And people say, well, what's Trump going over there?
[03:21:50.675 --> 03:21:55.117]  They were kissing his ass when he got there, because he went into their place and said, you better stop it.
[03:21:55.933 --> 03:22:09.042]  Well, the same criminal elements that are still within the military, the same people that were there under Obama, the same ones that could have taken those strikes, those different maneuvers to take out ISIS when they were convoying into Iraq and slowly taking over those areas.
[03:22:09.042 --> 03:22:10.363]  That was an Obama invasion.
[03:22:10.363 --> 03:22:10.763]  Yeah.
[03:22:10.763 --> 03:22:19.969]  I mean, we could have taken that out with what's called successive bracketing and just taken out that first vehicle, then the last vehicle, and then fire for effect through the middle.
[03:22:19.969 --> 03:22:20.670]  And it would have been done.
[03:22:20.670 --> 03:22:23.171]  That would have sent a clear and present message out there.
[03:22:23.171 --> 03:22:25.653]  They've got 10,000 Predator drones, 2,000 are in that theater.
[03:22:26.393 --> 03:22:30.035]  They don't, but it's just like the same reason drug companies don't want to cure cancer.
[03:22:30.035 --> 03:22:30.835]  Yeah.
[03:22:30.835 --> 03:22:34.217]  You don't want to end the war, because if you end the war, then how do you justify it?
[03:22:34.217 --> 03:22:34.517]  I do.
[03:22:34.517 --> 03:22:36.958]  I want to end orthodox Islam.
[03:22:36.958 --> 03:22:40.439]  Well, we don't, we don't want war, but we're not making... No, no, no, I agree.
[03:22:40.439 --> 03:22:41.540]  I'm saying I want to end it.
[03:22:42.662 --> 03:22:43.763]  Yeah, but we're patriots.
[03:22:43.763 --> 03:22:44.983]  We're not the Deep State.
[03:22:44.983 --> 03:22:50.566]  The Deep State wants a never-ending war because it allows them to murder more people, murder more children.
[03:22:50.566 --> 03:22:52.747]  It allows them to traffic more children.
[03:22:52.747 --> 03:22:54.828]  It's a big cover, as we all know.
[03:22:54.828 --> 03:22:57.850]  A lot of these wars are a big cover for human trafficking.
[03:22:57.850 --> 03:22:59.611]  And that's why every time you have a war,
[03:23:00.271 --> 03:23:02.952]  They're able to go in and buy more slaves on the open market.
[03:23:02.952 --> 03:23:05.133]  Well, that's what's happening in Missoula right now.
[03:23:05.133 --> 03:23:07.094]  Like I said, I've got buddies over in Missoula right now.
[03:23:07.094 --> 03:23:09.775]  They're called the Free Ranger or Free Burma Rangers.
[03:23:09.775 --> 03:23:17.359]  And that's literally their mission right there is rescuing women and children from being held in captivity and sold off into human trafficking as sex slaves.
[03:23:17.359 --> 03:23:19.479]  Well, look how we knew this a year ago.
[03:23:19.479 --> 03:23:21.280]  But now it's confirmed mainstream news.
[03:23:21.280 --> 03:23:29.764]  Tens of thousands of women and children a month are being loaded on boats in Tripoli, grabbed out of the country by the Islamists that run it now, and are being sold on the open market.
[03:23:29.884 --> 03:23:44.376]  I've got footage of women carrying their babies, running in fear from radical Islam, from Sharia law in western Missoula, trying to flee to Erbil, while they're being sniped in the head, dropping their babies, and then Americans coming over, running, grabbing those babies, dragging them.
[03:23:44.376 --> 03:23:45.417]  Oh yeah, I saw the footage.
[03:23:45.417 --> 03:23:47.859]  I couldn't believe CNN actually aired it, but they don't think it's true.
[03:23:47.859 --> 03:23:48.779]  Yeah, they filmed my bodies.
[03:23:48.779 --> 03:23:49.880]  Those are the ones.
[03:23:49.880 --> 03:23:51.802]  Guys, pull up, what's the name of the video?
[03:23:51.802 --> 03:23:54.644]  It's, uh, Man Saves Child Under Sniper Attack?
[03:23:54.644 --> 03:23:56.386]  Yeah, it was the Free Burma Rangers.
[03:23:58.082 --> 03:23:59.783]  During the break, I saw that footage.
[03:23:59.783 --> 03:24:00.884]  Those are my buddies.
[03:24:00.884 --> 03:24:02.745]  I can't believe that CNN actually showed that.
[03:24:02.745 --> 03:24:04.226]  I was shocked too, it came out last week.
[03:24:04.226 --> 03:24:06.368]  They know people don't know who's who.
[03:24:06.368 --> 03:24:09.771]  They're like, look at these brave people saving someone in the Civil War.
[03:24:09.771 --> 03:24:14.434]  They don't explain, they're fighting the group that our own government brought in.
[03:24:14.434 --> 03:24:17.317]  And that Trump is the one letting them in to save the girl.
[03:24:17.317 --> 03:24:19.719]  It should be, Trump soldiers save girl.
[03:24:20.559 --> 03:24:22.600]  I'm meeting with these guys in Waco in a few weeks.
[03:24:22.600 --> 03:24:27.142]  He's giving a speech and I'm trying to find out a plan of... I was about to say, you almost went over there about a year ago.
[03:24:27.142 --> 03:24:28.923]  Yeah, but then we had to go to the RNC and the DNC.
[03:24:28.923 --> 03:24:30.804]  It was right at that same time, so I ended up pushing it off.
[03:24:30.804 --> 03:24:34.466]  So now I have an opportunity again to meet with this guy here in the state.
[03:24:34.466 --> 03:24:34.926]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:24:34.926 --> 03:24:36.107]  Incredible moment, aid worker.
[03:24:36.627 --> 03:24:38.148]  Spreads 150 yards, gun is hard to save a girl.
[03:24:38.148 --> 03:24:41.852]  They call him an aid worker to make it seem like it's a UNAID thing, though.
[03:24:41.852 --> 03:24:42.712]  No, no, it's a U.S.
[03:24:42.712 --> 03:24:43.833]  soldier.
[03:24:43.833 --> 03:24:45.755]  He is a ex-U.S.
[03:24:45.755 --> 03:24:55.083]  Army Ranger who has his wife there, his 10-year-old daughter there, his 6-year-old son, and another daughter, I can't remember her age, and they all live in Erbil, Iraq.
[03:24:55.083 --> 03:24:56.044]  That's a total commitment.
[03:24:56.784 --> 03:24:58.845]  They've been there for going on two years.
[03:24:58.845 --> 03:24:59.605]  That's him right there.
[03:24:59.605 --> 03:25:00.985]  No, I remember.
[03:25:00.985 --> 03:25:04.366]  We were talking to him a year ago and I was going to maybe help fund to have you go there.
[03:25:04.366 --> 03:25:04.686]  Yeah.
[03:25:04.686 --> 03:25:05.486]  And then I didn't.
[03:25:05.486 --> 03:25:07.207]  I want to do that.
[03:25:07.207 --> 03:25:07.787]  I'm going to.
[03:25:07.787 --> 03:25:08.627]  I'm looking to do it.
[03:25:08.627 --> 03:25:08.927]  I remember.
[03:25:08.927 --> 03:25:09.507]  That's the guy.
[03:25:09.507 --> 03:25:11.368]  Meanwhile, I'm like, I've heard of those guys.
[03:25:11.368 --> 03:25:12.748]  Dave Eubank is his name.
[03:25:12.748 --> 03:25:12.988]  Yeah.
[03:25:12.988 --> 03:25:14.009]  Let's go back to that.
[03:25:14.009 --> 03:25:14.769]  OK, let's go to the calls.
[03:25:14.769 --> 03:25:15.349]  That's him on the left.
[03:25:16.681 --> 03:25:20.203]  And that's his little daughter in the back, in the camo, in the DCU.
[03:25:20.203 --> 03:25:24.164]  And that's a little, uh, I think I can't remember if it was like a little Lazidi girl or whatever.
[03:25:24.164 --> 03:25:27.106]  God, people don't know that, like, veterans are bringing their families into this.
[03:25:27.106 --> 03:25:27.946]  Wow, that's amazing.
[03:25:27.946 --> 03:25:36.910]  Yeah, I mean, there's, my buddy was just over there, Joel, and he has footage of these girls taming, like, wild Arabian horses and breaking them in.
[03:25:36.910 --> 03:25:39.011]  Like, this little girl out there, I mean, she's going to grow up.
[03:25:39.011 --> 03:25:40.432]  She's the opposite of some TV head.
[03:25:40.612 --> 03:25:42.735]  And why doesn't Megyn Kelly cover this?
[03:25:42.735 --> 03:25:46.721]  Yeah, the story is that patriots are bringing their kids in there.
[03:25:46.721 --> 03:25:48.944]  Because there's no teleprompter in Mizzou.
[03:25:48.944 --> 03:25:53.431]  Why don't they go there and do a positive segment showing people the truth?
[03:25:53.431 --> 03:25:55.835]  Well, because their owners won't let them do that, of course.
[03:25:57.540 --> 03:25:59.342]  That's the evil we're up against.
[03:25:59.342 --> 03:26:04.446]  I can't talk about a lot of this, but as you know, there are brigades and brigades of former U.S.
[03:26:04.446 --> 03:26:11.713]  soldiers actually in Africa and in the Middle East actually saving the families right now from slaughter and then trying to actually get them out.
[03:26:11.713 --> 03:26:14.275]  And under Obama, he was blocking them getting out.
[03:26:14.275 --> 03:26:17.718]  He only lets military-age men come in that have Wahhabist passports.
[03:26:17.858 --> 03:26:19.719]  Well, there's a lot of guys that were contractors.
[03:26:19.719 --> 03:26:25.823]  I mean, those guys, if you worked hard, you stayed over there for a long period of time, you could really get a nice bankroll, save a lot of money.
[03:26:25.823 --> 03:26:27.625]  And now these guys are not contractors.
[03:26:27.625 --> 03:26:30.747]  They're going over there on their own dime just because they think it's the right thing to do.
[03:26:30.747 --> 03:26:32.028]  They know it's the right thing to do.
[03:26:32.028 --> 03:26:39.433]  And they're going out there and establishing a system on how to pull these women and children out and keep them from being sold as human slaves and sex trafficking and all that.
[03:26:39.433 --> 03:26:40.834]  Because it's a huge problem, like he said.
[03:26:40.834 --> 03:26:42.295]  And again, this is the story.
[03:26:43.100 --> 03:26:44.761]  We should, the whole show should have been about this.
[03:26:44.761 --> 03:26:45.882]  It's just incredible.
[03:26:45.882 --> 03:26:49.766]  Alright, O'Brien and Marilyn, you're on the air about Megyn Kelly, then Joseph and Eric.
[03:26:49.766 --> 03:26:53.309]  I apologize for you holding so long, go ahead.
[03:26:53.309 --> 03:26:54.890]  Well, pretty much.
[03:26:54.890 --> 03:26:59.894]  If I was, if I had my own champagne glass, I'd be, I'd be sharing you all with you.
[03:26:59.894 --> 03:27:05.359]  But, what I think, what you did back there was pretty, pretty good.
[03:27:05.359 --> 03:27:07.701]  Even though the whole thing blew up in your face.
[03:27:07.701 --> 03:27:10.383]  I mean, not your face, I mean, Kelly's face.
[03:27:11.218 --> 03:27:18.506]  I mean, the whole thing just didn't even get in.
[03:27:18.506 --> 03:27:20.569]  Sure, your phone's breaking up a bit, but I agree.
[03:27:20.569 --> 03:27:22.711]  I got blown up, she got blown up.
[03:27:22.711 --> 03:27:24.573]  I mean, I think overall though, she got defeated.
[03:27:24.573 --> 03:27:25.334]  What do you think?
[03:27:25.334 --> 03:27:26.215]  Yeah, big time.
[03:27:26.215 --> 03:27:27.696]  I mean, she came into your house.
[03:27:29.013 --> 03:27:33.874]  She came in here thinking that she could pull, you know, something over your eyes and play this whole game.
[03:27:33.874 --> 03:27:36.215]  You know, we've been around the block a few times.
[03:27:36.215 --> 03:27:37.836]  You've been on many things.
[03:27:37.836 --> 03:27:39.236]  I'll still say I look like hell, though.
[03:27:39.236 --> 03:27:43.977]  I mean, she edited that up, thank you, Brian, where it was indistinguishable from what I said.
[03:27:43.977 --> 03:27:47.858]  I mean, literally, you know, a two-hour sit-down, of course a few times I squirmed or whatever.
[03:27:47.858 --> 03:27:49.019]  It was indistinguishable.
[03:27:49.019 --> 03:27:49.999]  That wasn't what I said.
[03:27:51.442 --> 03:27:52.303]  It's tricky editing.
[03:27:52.303 --> 03:27:53.965]  You know, we already know that's what we're going to do.
[03:27:53.965 --> 03:27:55.767]  But not enough people watched it, you know.
[03:27:55.767 --> 03:27:57.328]  She's just irrelevant.
[03:27:57.328 --> 03:28:00.311]  I know, but... YouTube videos... 3.5 million people watched it, they said.
[03:28:00.311 --> 03:28:02.213]  I reached out in a day on Twitter if I'm bored.
[03:28:02.213 --> 03:28:03.735]  I know.
[03:28:03.735 --> 03:28:04.456]  That's if I'm bored.
[03:28:04.456 --> 03:28:05.637]  I know.
[03:28:05.637 --> 03:28:07.058]  A couple tweets a day.
[03:28:07.058 --> 03:28:12.324]  Hey, uh, Joseph in Oregon, go ahead.
[03:28:12.324 --> 03:28:13.025]  Thanks, brother, go ahead.
[03:28:14.967 --> 03:28:15.988]  Uh, yeah.
[03:28:15.988 --> 03:28:20.231]  Um, well, first of all, congratulations on having Megyn Kelly blow up in her face.
[03:28:20.231 --> 03:28:21.553]  I thought that was hilarious.
[03:28:21.553 --> 03:28:23.754]  Thank you.
[03:28:23.754 --> 03:28:31.821]  Um, what I wanted to bring to light is actually something, well, thanks to you, I actually started digging in deep to things that most people wouldn't think of.
[03:28:31.821 --> 03:28:37.946]  And I actually started researching and I came across an interesting thing that you may or may not know about.
[03:28:37.946 --> 03:28:43.610]  It's an, he was an ex KGB agent named, uh, Yuri Vesemet.
[03:28:43.610 --> 03:28:44.331]  Sorry, Yuri.
[03:28:44.952 --> 03:28:46.133]  Yeah, I believe so.
[03:29:11.055 --> 03:29:12.095]  Yeah, that's powerful.
[03:29:12.095 --> 03:29:13.036]  That's documented.
[03:29:13.036 --> 03:29:18.458]  And that was globalist programming that we put on Russia, and then it just came back at us.
[03:29:18.458 --> 03:29:19.638]  That's why we say, what?
[03:29:19.638 --> 03:29:28.982]  This looks so familiar, and that's because that's what the globalists cooked up for everybody.
[03:29:28.982 --> 03:29:31.683]  We think we won the Soviet Union or the Cold War.
[03:29:31.683 --> 03:29:38.445]  In fact, the Cold War came around and came back on us, uniquely, without us even realizing, and now we're having to deal with the after effect.
[03:29:38.445 --> 03:29:39.646]  You want to add more to that, Joseph?
[03:29:41.502 --> 03:29:43.004]  Nah, I think I got it.
[03:29:43.004 --> 03:29:44.406]  Alright, God bless you, brother.
[03:29:44.406 --> 03:29:45.387]  Yeah, that's a powerful interview.
[03:29:45.387 --> 03:29:46.389]  Everybody should watch it.
[03:29:46.389 --> 03:29:48.411]  It's ideology, not where you're from.
[03:29:48.411 --> 03:29:49.873]  It's ideology.
[03:29:49.873 --> 03:29:51.255]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.255 --> 03:29:53.799]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.799 --> 03:29:56.463]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.141 --> 03:30:03.662]  Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine.
[03:30:03.662 --> 03:30:12.727]  On Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage of the New York Public Disgrace Theater showing of Caesar, which should really be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination of President Trump.
[03:30:12.727 --> 03:30:17.070]  She rushed the stage, insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands.
[03:30:17.330 --> 03:30:21.991]  As well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[03:30:21.991 --> 03:30:33.973]  While she was being arrested, Jack Posobiec went live on Twitter to broadcast the event, and then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience that Joseph Goebbels would be proud of this production, and that they were Nazis.
[03:30:33.973 --> 03:30:40.435]  While the left is having side effects of outrage to their own medicine, even allies in the Trump movement have been at odds over the protest.
[03:30:40.435 --> 03:30:46.976]  Regardless, the very next night, more protesters took the stage, shouting Goebbels would be proud, CNN is ISIS.
[03:30:47.236 --> 03:30:57.785]  While the protesters were all arrested, rumor has it some of the police involved support the protest against the expression of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York Public Theater against our president.
[03:30:57.785 --> 03:31:00.968]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:31:00.968 --> 03:31:11.137]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[03:31:11.337 --> 03:31:18.443]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:18.443 --> 03:31:23.327]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:23.327 --> 03:31:30.113]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:30.113 --> 03:31:37.159]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:37.259 --> 03:31:44.284]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:44.284 --> 03:31:48.787]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:48.787 --> 03:31:58.473]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:58.473 --> 03:32:00.154]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:32:02.268 --> 03:32:06.051]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:32:06.051 --> 03:32:13.776]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:13.776 --> 03:32:22.402]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:22.402 --> 03:32:26.824]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:32:26.824 --> 03:32:31.968]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[03:32:32.228 --> 03:32:33.529]  We're good to go.
[03:33:04.642 --> 03:33:07.304]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:07.304 --> 03:33:09.346]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:09.346 --> 03:33:10.046]  Oh yeah!
[03:33:10.046 --> 03:33:13.749]  From the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:33:13.749 --> 03:33:18.413]  Ha ha ha!
[03:33:18.413 --> 03:33:19.774]  Yeah!
[03:33:19.774 --> 03:33:23.618]  I know you can't stand it.
[03:33:23.618 --> 03:33:27.621]  Malcolm Nance, about a month ago, called for ISIS to hit Trump properties.
[03:33:27.621 --> 03:33:29.682]  Then he bitched on Bill Maher, we made it up.
[03:33:29.682 --> 03:33:30.663]  Did we make it up?
[03:33:30.663 --> 03:33:31.204]  Here's the clip.
[03:33:32.918 --> 03:33:41.293]  Recently, we've been observing leftists fantasizing about Trump assassinations and hate-filled rhetoric of the left inspiring real attacks on political adversaries.
[03:33:42.162 --> 03:33:57.329]  But now we have come to a new low as self-proclaimed counter-terrorist expert and friend of Kathy Griffin and Russian conspiracy theorist Malcolm Nance has apparently decided to start choosing targets for ISIS suicide bombers.
[03:33:57.329 --> 03:34:10.396]  In a recent tweet that has since been deleted, Malcolm Nance said in reference to the Trump Tower in Istanbul, this is my nominee for first ISIS suicide bombing of a Trump property.
[03:34:11.644 --> 03:34:13.105]  Nominee.
[03:34:13.105 --> 03:34:14.606]  Words matter.
[03:34:14.606 --> 03:34:17.408]  He wasn't warning against a possible attack.
[03:34:17.408 --> 03:34:21.251]  He was nominating it to be the first attack.
[03:34:21.251 --> 03:34:29.597]  When you nominate a candidate for president, you willfully and carefully choose that candidate and hope they get elected.
[03:34:29.597 --> 03:34:36.082]  Does that mean that Malcolm Nance willfully and carefully chose this target with the hopes that ISIS would attack?
[03:34:37.458 --> 03:34:55.022]  And Malcolm should know that ISIS can be motivated by speech because he certainly seemed to think so when he said that if Trump got elected, that his speech would somehow radicalize the 1.6 billion so-called moderate Muslims around the world into joining ISIS.
[03:34:55.022 --> 03:35:05.064]  They want someone to go off into space and inflame the other 1.6 billion Muslims so that they can come off the fence and join ISIS and other groups.
[03:35:06.195 --> 03:35:08.714]  For Cernovich Media, I'm Devin Stack.
[03:35:10.327 --> 03:35:11.307]  Man, your videos are great.
[03:35:11.307 --> 03:35:12.788]  That's a great team you've got.
[03:35:12.788 --> 03:35:13.848]  Yeah, they're amazing guys.
[03:35:13.848 --> 03:35:23.032]  And of course, that segues into an article, too, where Scott Pelley, who tried to go against me on 60 Minutes, said that the congressional shooting was, in many ways, self-inflicted.
[03:35:23.032 --> 03:35:28.454]  So, we can point... I just love how these guys' arrogance undoes them every time.
[03:35:28.454 --> 03:35:33.496]  I mean, they don't... They just ignore our numbers, but we know they're not because they're so freaked out.
[03:35:33.496 --> 03:35:38.198]  Our wanting to make America safer and better, you know, we brought this upon ourselves for that.
[03:35:39.233 --> 03:35:41.915]  That's why people are going to shoot us, because we're going to make the country better.
[03:35:41.915 --> 03:35:43.277]  I mean, it's just our own fault.
[03:35:43.277 --> 03:35:55.247]  And the media wants terrorism for the ratings and the ad dollars, and sell people more pharmaceuticals, and get people more on SSRIs, and get people popping pills, and control people, and brainwash people, keep everybody home.
[03:35:55.247 --> 03:35:57.549]  I mean, if you think about it, they just want you...
[03:35:58.269 --> 03:36:07.557]  Inside your home, never leaving, never part of your community, isolated and alienated, and then that's how they can radicalize people through their chat rooms and stuff.
[03:36:07.557 --> 03:36:16.806]  I mean, we all know, we all know that they have chat rooms where they find these wayward people and they radicalize them and brainwash them and say, why don't you have the courage?
[03:36:16.806 --> 03:36:19.768]  Well, remember the Facebook documents came out a few months ago where they're targeting
[03:36:20.569 --> 03:36:27.853]  Pathetic, no friend, nobodies who we care about, but trying to turn them into SJWs as weaponized zombies.
[03:36:27.853 --> 03:36:29.474]  Yeah, it's a whole mind control mission.
[03:36:29.474 --> 03:36:30.094]  That's the whole thing.
[03:36:30.094 --> 03:36:33.016]  It's a nationwide brainwashing mind control mission.
[03:36:33.016 --> 03:36:34.017]  That's why they want to shut us out.
[03:36:34.017 --> 03:36:39.440]  Because I was thinking about this actually earlier today and I was like, you know, when you really think about what we believe,
[03:36:40.220 --> 03:36:43.481]  We shouldn't have jobs because people should say that is just boring.
[03:36:43.481 --> 03:36:46.863]  We believe in prosperity, peace, equal opportunity, entrepreneurialism.
[03:36:46.863 --> 03:36:48.504]  There's a war on common sense.
[03:36:48.504 --> 03:36:51.365]  Yeah, I'm thinking like why do people hate us?
[03:36:51.365 --> 03:36:56.007]  People should say, you know, you guys are just boring because of course everybody wants the races to unite.
[03:36:56.007 --> 03:36:57.908]  They want equal treatment for everybody.
[03:36:57.908 --> 03:36:59.608]  They want entrepreneurialism.
[03:36:59.608 --> 03:37:01.909]  They want people to feel hopeful and optimistic.
[03:37:01.909 --> 03:37:03.170]  We shouldn't have jobs.
[03:37:03.730 --> 03:37:15.741]  But when we say things like we want people to feel empowered, and to have energy, and to feel good about life, and to be connected, and be involved in their community, and to take care of one another, that gets us attacked.
[03:37:15.741 --> 03:37:16.923]  It's so bizarre.
[03:37:16.923 --> 03:37:20.486]  Because the big corporations want to take over, and they've done the equations.
[03:37:20.486 --> 03:37:21.527]  Everybody's a bunch of zombies.
[03:37:21.527 --> 03:37:22.147]  They can take over.
[03:37:22.932 --> 03:37:24.873]  Yeah, mindless consumers is what they want.
[03:37:24.873 --> 03:37:26.453]  Mindless consumerism.
[03:37:26.453 --> 03:37:27.854]  Brainwash people.
[03:37:27.854 --> 03:37:28.994]  Get them into debt.
[03:37:28.994 --> 03:37:30.414]  Make them take out student loans.
[03:37:30.414 --> 03:37:31.395]  Stay on welfare.
[03:37:31.395 --> 03:37:32.095]  Stay in their house.
[03:37:32.095 --> 03:37:33.315]  Watch their programming.
[03:37:33.315 --> 03:37:36.076]  Get in their autonomous car so they can control where they go.
[03:37:36.076 --> 03:37:37.917]  And they're being watched everywhere they are.
[03:37:37.917 --> 03:37:39.317]  It's just ridiculous.
[03:37:39.317 --> 03:37:41.018]  God, who would want to live like that?
[03:37:41.018 --> 03:37:42.838]  Sounds horrible.
[03:37:42.838 --> 03:37:43.938]  That's why you need to get out there.
[03:37:43.938 --> 03:37:44.559]  Get a gun.
[03:37:44.559 --> 03:37:45.099]  Go hunting.
[03:37:45.099 --> 03:37:46.079]  Kill your own food.
[03:37:46.079 --> 03:37:48.700]  Because they are the ultimate OCD, though.
[03:37:48.700 --> 03:37:51.221]  Because I get a little OCD about information because I want it all.
[03:37:54.709 --> 03:37:57.217]  Literally just want to control everything we do.
[03:37:58.208 --> 03:37:58.628]  Yeah.
[03:37:58.628 --> 03:38:00.049]  It's bizarre.
[03:38:00.049 --> 03:38:01.650]  And I don't know why they would enjoy that.
[03:38:01.650 --> 03:38:06.613]  They want... I mean, I think I probably do is because of the slavery issue and everything like that.
[03:38:06.613 --> 03:38:15.418]  And it's also easier to... So just like they're trying to groom people for pedophilia and stuff, it's easier for the pedophiles and everybody to human traffic and everything.
[03:38:15.418 --> 03:38:21.241]  So there's a lot of that, too, is the modern day slavery that the elite use and the pedophilia tactics.
[03:38:21.241 --> 03:38:23.903]  They want globalism because it's predatory.
[03:38:23.903 --> 03:38:27.245]  There's a lot of folks with different tastes, but they like the predatory nature of it.
[03:38:27.925 --> 03:38:37.292]  Exactly, and what better way to go, just like they did in Rotherham, what better way to find all this, all this slavery and all these people, broken homes.
[03:38:37.292 --> 03:38:41.816]  We all know that broken homes allow them to groom, pedophiles to groom people.
[03:38:41.816 --> 03:38:49.342]  So you realize, that is why when I say the media is a terrorist organization, the media supports pedophilia and they think that I'm overstating things.
[03:38:49.762 --> 03:38:57.406]  And I say, if anything, I'm actually understanding it because you're trying to destroy the family, you're trying to destroy virtue, you won't investigate things, you cover things up.
[03:38:57.406 --> 03:39:06.850]  When there is an arrest, like with Anthony Weiner, the Washington Post, I don't know if you guys have the story, you covered it, there was an article in the Washington Post where they said, stop talking about Anthony Weiner.
[03:39:08.119 --> 03:39:09.340]  Washington Post.
[03:39:09.340 --> 03:39:16.923]  Why should we stop talking about a pedophile who was being groomed to be the president, who was married to Uma, who was Hillary's top person?
[03:39:16.923 --> 03:39:19.124]  They're saying don't talk about pedophiles.
[03:39:19.124 --> 03:39:22.605]  And then they wonder why we accuse them of endorsing pedophilia.
[03:39:22.605 --> 03:39:27.667]  In Juarez, Mexico, and Mexico in general, there's a large homosexual population.
[03:39:27.667 --> 03:39:30.469]  And those children, those boys, are kicked out of their homes.
[03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:32.910]  And they get sent to what's like halfway houses.
[03:39:32.910 --> 03:39:35.131]  And these halfway houses are really fronts for
[03:39:36.892 --> 03:39:38.654]  Like a prostitution ring.
[03:39:38.654 --> 03:39:47.802]  And I'm working on something, I've been going down to Mexico over the last few months, but there's an elected official, numerous ones here in the US, that are flying down there and getting these boys.
[03:39:47.802 --> 03:39:49.143]  And they're doing this stuff.
[03:39:49.143 --> 03:39:59.292]  And it's right there and the cartels are running these facilities and they're allowing these boys to come in there and they're selling them off as prostitutes to rich, elite people.
[03:39:59.292 --> 03:40:00.033]  It's pretty disturbing.
[03:40:01.225 --> 03:40:02.366]  And the media doesn't want to cover this?
[03:40:02.366 --> 03:40:04.548]  And it's happening in Haiti, and it's happening all over the world.
[03:40:04.548 --> 03:40:05.309]  It's not just there.
[03:40:05.309 --> 03:40:10.213]  I mean, in Australia, it's happening all over the world, and that's the biggest story in the world.
[03:40:10.213 --> 03:40:12.375]  But they'll cover anything we do.
[03:40:12.375 --> 03:40:17.819]  You know, if we make one joke or, you know, maybe misstate a word, that'll be big international news.
[03:40:17.819 --> 03:40:25.025]  But when it comes to actual pedophilia rings going on, and elected officials like Dennis Haskett, of course, pedophile, he was in D.C.
[03:40:25.025 --> 03:40:25.345]  for 20 years.
[03:40:26.346 --> 03:40:27.268]  Why is nobody in the video?
[03:40:27.268 --> 03:40:28.991]  For the Republicans as a procurer.
[03:40:28.991 --> 03:40:29.813]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:40:29.813 --> 03:40:31.756]  But let me ask this then.
[03:40:31.756 --> 03:40:34.461]  Why are they so angry at Infowars?
[03:40:34.461 --> 03:40:36.225]  Because... Exposing it.
[03:40:37.475 --> 03:40:38.715]  A lot of these people are a part of that.
[03:40:38.715 --> 03:40:41.316]  Yeah, it's hard for you to understand because you're not an evil person.
[03:40:41.316 --> 03:40:42.736]  It's hard to empathize.
[03:40:42.736 --> 03:40:50.218]  But if you get into just the heart of darkness and you think about it, they're saying, well, wait a minute, you're trying to tell people to not be victims.
[03:40:50.218 --> 03:40:52.439]  You're taking away... Exactly.
[03:40:52.439 --> 03:40:52.919]  That's it.
[03:40:52.919 --> 03:40:56.780]  It's the empowerment and it's the spirit, the aggressiveness against them.
[03:40:56.780 --> 03:40:57.640]  They think they're evil.
[03:40:57.640 --> 03:40:58.560]  I'm ready.
[03:40:58.560 --> 03:40:58.960]  I'm ready.
[03:40:58.960 --> 03:41:00.501]  You know, I'm afraid of them.
[03:41:00.501 --> 03:41:01.801]  And I do have some thoughts.
[03:41:01.801 --> 03:41:05.382]  And they pick that up as they understand that they feel the violence.
[03:41:05.973 --> 03:41:12.939]  Yeah, and so you're essentially taking away their child victims from them by encouraging what you're doing.
[03:41:12.939 --> 03:41:15.921]  Because they want to hurt innocents when they feel powerful.
[03:41:15.921 --> 03:41:18.944]  They don't like aggressive men planning war.
[03:41:18.944 --> 03:41:22.126]  Exactly, and they, so just think, they take it personally.
[03:41:22.126 --> 03:41:26.149]  They're thinking you're keeping me from doing the things that I want to do.
[03:41:26.149 --> 03:41:31.013]  Because, you know, they want to strangle and kill more than two or three children a week, and they can barely get the numbers they want.
[03:41:31.013 --> 03:41:35.397]  If they had a world government, then they could torture children every hour and then rape and murder little girls.
[03:41:35.797 --> 03:41:36.757]  And little boys.
[03:41:36.757 --> 03:41:37.217]  Exactly.
[03:41:37.217 --> 03:41:37.938]  That's what it is.
[03:41:37.938 --> 03:41:40.058]  We're just getting in the way of their fun.
[03:41:40.058 --> 03:41:40.618]  Yeah.
[03:41:40.618 --> 03:41:43.139]  So they just see us as like a doorway blocking them.
[03:41:43.139 --> 03:41:44.719]  They're trying to blow the door down.
[03:41:44.719 --> 03:41:46.060]  Well, that's why they take it personally.
[03:41:46.060 --> 03:41:48.000]  That's why they're so angry, right?
[03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:50.601]  Because they never want to disagree with us intellectually.
[03:41:50.601 --> 03:41:53.222]  They'll never want to debate our ideas intellectually.
[03:41:53.222 --> 03:41:55.462]  For them, this is very, very personal.
[03:41:55.462 --> 03:42:02.804]  You are stopping them from molesting children, from engaging in human trafficking, just like Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein taking trips to... All the rest of them.
[03:42:02.824 --> 03:42:11.668]  I mean, the entire Clinton Foundation people all busted, changing names, shipping kids in, U.N., murdering children, enslaving them en masse, everywhere.
[03:42:11.668 --> 03:42:13.589]  It's a cult of pedophiles.
[03:42:13.589 --> 03:42:19.672]  And the reason that we're so hated is because we're the ones calling out Dennis Haster, Republican Speaker of the House pedophile.
[03:42:19.672 --> 03:42:21.372]  We'll say they're Republican pedophiles, too.
[03:42:21.372 --> 03:42:26.535]  We just want to get all of them out of D.C., all of them out of Hollywood, and we're not playing the part.
[03:42:27.295 --> 03:42:28.516]  Most people don't even have children of their own.
[03:42:28.516 --> 03:42:29.818]  We all have kids, we understand.
[03:42:29.818 --> 03:42:31.980]  Have you noticed the amount of Naga folks that don't have kids?
[03:42:31.980 --> 03:42:34.943]  Well, good people don't, but they were saying the whole EU doesn't have kids.
[03:42:34.943 --> 03:42:36.064]  Yeah, none of these people.
[03:42:36.064 --> 03:42:37.225]  They don't have them.
[03:42:37.225 --> 03:42:37.646]  No.
[03:42:37.646 --> 03:42:38.927]  They take them from us.
[03:42:38.927 --> 03:42:39.468]  Yeah.
[03:42:39.468 --> 03:42:41.370]  And now, they want us to die?
[03:42:41.370 --> 03:42:44.433]  You know what a Republican says when they say that.
[03:42:45.402 --> 03:42:46.703]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:42:46.703 --> 03:42:48.083]  You will die.
[03:42:48.083 --> 03:42:53.865]  But getting serious here, Megyn Kelly's showdown with Alex Jones is a ratings bust for NBC Sunday night.
[03:42:53.865 --> 03:42:55.866]  Record low, 3.5 million.
[03:42:55.866 --> 03:42:58.307]  Some would say, oh Jones, you're not a big draw.
[03:42:58.307 --> 03:43:00.168]  Our little videos had more than that.
[03:43:00.168 --> 03:43:03.409]  It showed everyone ran from media hype.
[03:43:03.409 --> 03:43:04.910]  They don't want to listen to you.
[03:43:05.330 --> 03:43:07.873]  We already knew it was going to happen, and he kind of scooped them on their own thing.
[03:43:07.873 --> 03:43:09.755]  He already knew it was going to be a hit piece.
[03:43:09.755 --> 03:43:12.218]  And he had the gold right there when she came on.
[03:43:12.218 --> 03:43:14.621]  And he had that audio where she's like, oh, that's not a gotcha thing.
[03:43:14.621 --> 03:43:16.584]  It's just, it's a profile review.
[03:43:16.584 --> 03:43:18.726]  You're really turning me on right now.
[03:43:18.726 --> 03:43:19.547]  I'm kind of into you.
[03:43:19.547 --> 03:43:20.528]  I'm obsessed, all right?
[03:43:21.409 --> 03:43:26.854]  I was like, that was the biggest, that was the, I literally laughed till I had tears come out of my eyes when I heard that.
[03:43:26.854 --> 03:43:32.879]  I was like, you lying sack of... Well she actually, she got divorced actually because her husband was a little bit too beta.
[03:43:32.879 --> 03:43:37.343]  So you can actually, in the divorce records, Megyn Kelly's divorce is actually quite interesting.
[03:43:37.343 --> 03:43:39.365]  And she wanted somebody who was a little bit...
[03:43:39.645 --> 03:43:41.487]  That's going to be all over.
[03:43:41.487 --> 03:43:44.351]  I'm not into her.
[03:43:44.351 --> 03:43:46.393]  I'm not going to go down that path.
[03:43:46.393 --> 03:43:50.819]  Megyn Kelly, you don't have enough money to ever get me to be with you.
[03:43:50.819 --> 03:43:52.481]  Plus, I don't sell myself for money.
[03:43:52.481 --> 03:43:55.445]  I know you're secretly lost and everything, but it's alright.
[03:43:56.165 --> 03:43:58.546]  They'll make jokes, they'll say, oh it was misogynistic.
[03:43:58.546 --> 03:43:59.927]  I'm trolling the media.
[03:43:59.927 --> 03:44:00.847]  I know I'm not a Muslim.
[03:44:00.847 --> 03:44:03.889]  Cut women's genitals off and sell them into sex slavery.
[03:44:03.889 --> 03:44:05.590]  It's called a joke!
[03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:11.672]  Eric in the great state of Indiana, from where Vice President Pence has risen.
[03:44:11.672 --> 03:44:14.594]  Eric in Indiana, last call of the day.
[03:44:14.594 --> 03:44:14.854]  Eric.
[03:44:16.621 --> 03:44:19.323]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[03:44:19.323 --> 03:44:25.168]  The way I look at the civil war they're trying to push, I think their endgame is to usher in the police state.
[03:44:25.168 --> 03:44:37.557]  I think what they want to do is get us patriots so mad, like they're going to kill Trump, get us to flip out over it, and then they're going to use the police to kind of take control back.
[03:44:37.557 --> 03:44:39.259]  I think that's their plan behind it.
[03:44:42.305 --> 03:44:43.148]  That's a great point.
[03:44:43.148 --> 03:44:43.690]  Eric, stay there.
[03:44:43.690 --> 03:44:45.055]  I want you to come back with a comment.
[03:44:45.055 --> 03:44:46.380]  But yeah, what if they kill Trump?
[03:44:48.956 --> 03:44:49.917]  I don't know.
[03:44:49.917 --> 03:44:51.078]  That's an interesting thing.
[03:44:51.078 --> 03:44:53.760]  I mean, you know, how are people going to react?
[03:44:53.760 --> 03:45:00.967]  I mean, I personally think when I start seeing the left celebrating something like that, if that were to happen, you know, I don't know how I would act.
[03:45:00.967 --> 03:45:10.355]  I would be angry, you know, that there's a son that doesn't have a father anymore, there's sons that don't have a father anymore, there's a wife without a husband.
[03:45:10.355 --> 03:45:15.720]  They're always wanting to boycott us because they know they're the fake left parasites.
[03:45:16.300 --> 03:45:18.082]  We're the real left, Thomas Jefferson.
[03:45:18.082 --> 03:45:19.863]  These terms mean nothing.
[03:45:19.863 --> 03:45:21.125]  It's time to do what they do.
[03:45:21.125 --> 03:45:22.226]  Not give them our money.
[03:45:22.226 --> 03:45:23.647]  Not associate with them.
[03:45:23.647 --> 03:45:24.628]  Not play their games.
[03:45:24.628 --> 03:45:27.050]  They already want Tump dead.
[03:45:27.050 --> 03:45:28.792]  So we already act like they already killed him.
[03:45:28.792 --> 03:45:31.394]  But there's just such heartless, soulless people.
[03:45:31.394 --> 03:45:33.056]  They're joking about killing someone.
[03:45:33.876 --> 03:45:39.858]  It shows they have no human emotion whatsoever, no relationships in their lives, no heart, no care whatsoever.
[03:45:39.858 --> 03:45:51.222]  Like, you know, when I was in the military and someone died in combat, you know, I wasn't thinking, oh yeah, I got the bad guy, I'm sitting there kind of thinking in my head, I'm like, that guy had a wife, he had kids, you know, that's going to be a traumatic experience for somebody.
[03:45:51.222 --> 03:45:59.165]  You know, that rolls downhill, and for people to just sit there and laugh about it, and they're frothing at the mouth... But it's because they're wimps, they never killed anybody, or ever beat anybody.
[03:45:59.725 --> 03:46:01.326]  They've never been in reality, Joe.
[03:46:01.326 --> 03:46:15.791]  That's what's so sick, is them all calling for war, when as soon as it starts, it's like Antifa will walk over and hit a woman in the head with a bike lock, put her in a coma, and some guy breaks their jaw, and they go to the cops going, arrest him, arrest him!
[03:46:15.791 --> 03:46:17.572]  I'm only trying to kill women!
[03:46:17.572 --> 03:46:19.593]  And ten minutes before that, they're screaming, F the police.
[03:46:20.814 --> 03:46:22.255]  Exactly, then they go to the cops.
[03:46:22.255 --> 03:46:22.955]  Every time.
[03:46:22.955 --> 03:46:47.748]  Yeah, as far as what would happen, I definitely have a list, and if anything happens to me, then, you know, things will definitely... It wouldn't be a good idea, is what I'm saying, and I'm obviously not going to go into specifics, but we all have, you know, dead man switches, and there will be certain dominoes we'll tip over, so I imagine that Trump has the same thing, and that is why we disavow all political violence, and we encourage the media, which they refuse to do, they still won't do it,
[03:46:48.648 --> 03:46:52.411]  We're praying for peace, but preparing for war.
[03:46:52.411 --> 03:46:53.032]  Exactly.
[03:46:53.032 --> 03:46:55.033]  And we demand that the media disavow violence.
[03:46:55.033 --> 03:46:58.035]  Until they do it, we have to believe that they are inciting it.
[03:46:58.035 --> 03:47:05.881]  Because if I can do it, and everybody, Joe Biden is a veteran, combat veteran, disavows political violence, why can't the mainstream media join our pledge and disavow violence?
[03:47:05.881 --> 03:47:07.402]  Yeah, why won't they even talk about Antifa?
[03:47:08.142 --> 03:47:09.443]  To me, it's the most amazing thing in the world.
[03:47:09.443 --> 03:47:14.445]  These people show up with an agenda to literally commit acts of violence.
[03:47:14.445 --> 03:47:18.006]  They even talk about it on Facebook Live videos before they got there.
[03:47:18.006 --> 03:47:19.546]  They go, we're going to hit these fascists.
[03:47:19.546 --> 03:47:20.827]  We're going to beat up these Nazis.
[03:47:20.827 --> 03:47:21.847]  We're going to knock them in the head.
[03:47:21.847 --> 03:47:22.548]  And then they go and do it.
[03:47:22.548 --> 03:47:24.008]  And it's like, well, I didn't mean to.
[03:47:24.008 --> 03:47:31.751]  I was just kind of, I was just saying that, you know, just like, but they go all day on about a tweet, you know, oh my God, if you tweet something mean, call somebody fat or something.
[03:47:32.111 --> 03:47:33.632]  Oh, that's a big story.
[03:47:33.632 --> 03:47:34.072]  Mean tweet.
[03:47:34.072 --> 03:47:34.892]  Internet harassment.
[03:47:34.892 --> 03:47:36.293]  We ought to do something about it.
[03:47:36.293 --> 03:47:38.654]  But meanwhile, there's actual political violence in the street.
[03:47:38.654 --> 03:47:39.715]  And I'll tell you why.
[03:47:39.715 --> 03:47:44.897]  And this is why, you know, all the media people watching, why are you not disavowing political violence?
[03:47:44.897 --> 03:47:48.559]  Why is it that you can't just stand up and say, OK, the violence has to stop?
[03:47:48.559 --> 03:47:50.379]  We have to disagree with people civilly.
[03:47:50.379 --> 03:47:55.522]  Because they won't because they think we're weak because we're saying don't do it.
[03:47:55.522 --> 03:47:57.363]  They think we're disingenuous like them.
[03:47:58.223 --> 03:48:05.271]  I was at the East Valencia campus in Orlando, Florida for the Anti-Sharia March last week or whatever it was, two weeks ago.
[03:48:05.271 --> 03:48:07.794]  And the cops divided the university.
[03:48:07.794 --> 03:48:10.577]  They had our side on one side and Antifa on the other.
[03:48:10.577 --> 03:48:12.519]  And they said we couldn't cross this one road.
[03:48:12.519 --> 03:48:15.522]  So I think like I do, I said, OK, I crosswalk this way.
[03:48:15.522 --> 03:48:16.664]  I want to crosswalk over that way.
[03:48:16.664 --> 03:48:17.825]  And I came over by myself.
[03:48:17.825 --> 03:48:19.507]  And I go, you know, I'm going to talk to these guys.
[03:48:19.947 --> 03:48:21.228]  I want to know why they're mad at me.
[03:48:21.228 --> 03:48:26.873]  Why can't we just sit down, get a beer, let's go hang out and have a dialogue and maybe we find out we have a lot in common.
[03:48:26.873 --> 03:48:33.599]  They spit at me, they push, they threaten to punch me, all this stuff the entire time and the cops come running over and acting like I'm the bad guy.
[03:48:33.599 --> 03:48:38.883]  I said I'm the only one over here actually kind of come over here and have a conversation and find out the differences with you and me.
[03:48:38.883 --> 03:48:40.765]  Here's the question, why does the new left
[03:48:41.425 --> 03:48:43.926]  Look like they've been hit with a radiation beam.
[03:48:43.926 --> 03:48:44.726]  They can't talk.
[03:48:44.726 --> 03:48:45.927]  They look like they've had lobotomies.
[03:48:45.927 --> 03:48:46.987]  They have bozo hair.
[03:48:46.987 --> 03:48:49.408]  And they're like scramble around and like fall down.
[03:48:49.408 --> 03:48:50.529]  They'll be like, oh, excuse me.
[03:48:50.529 --> 03:48:51.329]  Oh, like fall down.
[03:48:51.329 --> 03:48:53.530]  I mean, who are these people?
[03:48:53.530 --> 03:48:53.930]  I don't know.
[03:48:53.930 --> 03:48:55.971]  They remind me of like the bubble kid or whatever.
[03:48:55.971 --> 03:48:57.171]  Because they're always covered.
[03:48:57.171 --> 03:48:58.392]  And all you can see is like eyes.
[03:48:58.392 --> 03:48:59.432]  They're afraid of the sun.
[03:48:59.432 --> 03:49:05.375]  And they're all frail and weak and like, bleh, the whole time.
[03:49:05.375 --> 03:49:07.416]  They would be in a lot of trouble if anything happened.
[03:49:07.416 --> 03:49:08.076]  But yeah.
[03:49:09.384 --> 03:49:13.687]  If things ever hit the fan, they're gonna die out in like two months.
[03:49:13.687 --> 03:49:14.808]  I mean, that's what I've told people.
[03:49:14.808 --> 03:49:17.050]  I was about to say, they want some apocalyptic war?
[03:49:17.050 --> 03:49:18.131]  Like, come on.
[03:49:18.131 --> 03:49:21.394]  I have like armored compounds, like 50 calibers.
[03:49:21.394 --> 03:49:30.982]  I know how to hunt my own food and skin the animals and actually and quarter them and then put them in and keep them so they stay, you know, fresh and be able to eat it.
[03:49:30.982 --> 03:49:34.424]  These guys be like, oh my god, my Hot Pockets are good.
[03:49:34.424 --> 03:49:34.825]  And be done.
[03:49:36.446 --> 03:49:37.868]  And the media's responsible for all this.
[03:49:37.868 --> 03:49:45.274]  I mean, really, that's what it comes down to, is the media is the one responsible for this, and they won't take any kind of personal responsibility.
[03:49:45.274 --> 03:49:49.218]  Scott Pelley is blaming gunshot victims, saying the wounds are self-inflicted.
[03:49:49.218 --> 03:49:50.779]  The media won't call him out on that.
[03:49:50.779 --> 03:49:57.966]  That would be 24 hours, just like when you... Imagine, they're saying, major execs say it's a false flag.
[03:49:57.966 --> 03:50:00.388]  We say it's a false flag when there's evidence of it.
[03:50:00.388 --> 03:50:01.609]  They're just saying it's a false flag.
[03:50:02.799 --> 03:50:04.040]  They get away with anything.
[03:50:04.040 --> 03:50:06.082]  But that's why we're here, but they don't though, really.
[03:50:06.082 --> 03:50:06.922]  I mean, the numbers tell the truth.
[03:50:06.922 --> 03:50:08.464]  So here's the big question.
[03:50:08.464 --> 03:50:09.505]  How does it end, though?
[03:50:09.505 --> 03:50:12.587]  We come back in the final segment, the Nightly News tonight at 7 o'clock.
[03:50:12.587 --> 03:50:22.675]  How does it end when their best gladiator they put out in the field against me, the wet walrus, who ain't that good, is like Tom Brokaw?
[03:50:22.675 --> 03:50:25.538]  I mean, what the what on earth is going on here?
[03:50:26.397 --> 03:50:27.998]  Well, he's a racist.
[03:50:27.998 --> 03:50:28.758]  Unalloyed, unalloyed.
[03:50:28.758 --> 03:50:35.220]  Like I told you on MSNBC yesterday, magic word, drum roll, unalloyed racist.
[03:50:35.220 --> 03:50:38.101]  We're going to skip the break, we're going to skip the break.
[03:50:38.101 --> 03:50:39.361]  So let me ask you guys that question.
[03:50:39.361 --> 03:50:41.222]  We can sit here and joke about this.
[03:50:41.222 --> 03:50:43.943]  What's really happening then?
[03:50:43.943 --> 03:50:46.164]  I mean, this was their last, you know, attempt.
[03:50:46.164 --> 03:50:46.984]  It's failed miserably.
[03:50:46.984 --> 03:50:49.205]  They're Waterloo.
[03:50:49.205 --> 03:50:50.405]  Now it's done.
[03:50:50.405 --> 03:50:51.986]  I mean, what do they do for me?
[03:50:51.986 --> 03:50:54.206]  I always war game, like, what would I do if I were them?
[03:50:54.206 --> 03:50:54.266]  And...
[03:50:56.849 --> 03:50:58.530]  They won't do what needs to be done.
[03:50:58.530 --> 03:51:00.371]  I would tell the truth to the American people.
[03:51:00.371 --> 03:51:03.353]  I would come out pro-America, pro-patriot.
[03:51:03.353 --> 03:51:05.755]  I would go against these drug companies that poison people.
[03:51:05.755 --> 03:51:08.957]  I would go against Wall Street, which rigs a market and which murders people.
[03:51:08.957 --> 03:51:10.798]  I would go against the human traffickers.
[03:51:10.798 --> 03:51:15.141]  I would go against the pedophiles in Hollywood and in the media and in Washington, D.C.
[03:51:15.141 --> 03:51:17.283]  But they're all part of that.
[03:51:17.283 --> 03:51:18.043]  That's the whole point.
[03:51:18.043 --> 03:51:21.265]  The only way they could beat us easily, they have billions of dollars.
[03:51:21.265 --> 03:51:23.947]  All they have to do is say, we're going to support the American people.
[03:51:23.947 --> 03:51:25.328]  They have to go against themselves.
[03:51:25.328 --> 03:51:25.828]  Exactly.
[03:51:26.749 --> 03:51:27.249]  Yeah, it's hilarious.
[03:51:27.249 --> 03:51:30.551]  Did you not point that out when she came in here in the studio?
[03:51:30.551 --> 03:51:32.452]  Did you notice the windy teleprompter?
[03:51:32.452 --> 03:51:33.732]  I did.
[03:51:33.732 --> 03:51:34.973]  None of that was on the show.
[03:51:51.220 --> 03:51:53.681]  I'm pretty sure you'd probably feel a little awkward if you were to sit behind this desk.
[03:51:53.681 --> 03:51:56.702]  I was right here, I go, look Megan, no teleprompters.
[03:51:56.702 --> 03:51:58.483]  I did it live on air too and none of that was in there.
[03:51:58.483 --> 03:51:59.844]  That's still the number one question I get.
[03:51:59.844 --> 03:52:02.205]  All they have is me over like 10 hours of off and on interviewing.
[03:52:02.205 --> 03:52:04.606]  A few times I'm like, huh, what, excuse me?
[03:52:04.606 --> 03:52:10.789]  They're like, Jones could hardly speak.
[03:52:10.789 --> 03:52:11.589]  That was the whole interview.
[03:52:11.589 --> 03:52:13.570]  That's the number one question I get every time I'm out.
[03:52:13.570 --> 03:52:16.011]  Megan, I want to kill the...
[03:52:17.248 --> 03:52:18.329]  I hate Nazis!
[03:52:18.329 --> 03:52:18.950]  I love humanity!
[03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:19.830]  I'm Alex Jones!
[03:52:19.830 --> 03:52:20.251]  I love Nazis!
[03:52:20.251 --> 03:52:20.671]  I hate humanity!
[03:52:46.913 --> 03:52:48.816]  Megan should have stayed in Fox News.
[03:52:48.816 --> 03:52:51.059]  She didn't realize.
[03:52:51.059 --> 03:52:52.520]  She made a big mistake.
[03:52:52.520 --> 03:52:54.323]  Fox News though.
[03:52:54.323 --> 03:52:57.206]  Fox News isn't even Fox News anymore.
[03:52:57.206 --> 03:52:59.950]  The whole media environment is changing.
[03:52:59.950 --> 03:53:01.852]  I had a feeling that was going to happen.
[03:53:04.542 --> 03:53:07.904]  The ability to kind of hold the upper hand and kind of go, all right, this is what's going on.
[03:53:07.904 --> 03:53:08.464]  This is what's wrong.
[03:53:08.464 --> 03:53:09.705]  This is what's wrong.
[03:53:09.705 --> 03:53:16.368]  You know, it was a lot easier for conservative media to kind of have that high road in a sense and kind of talk about stuff.
[03:53:17.883 --> 03:53:22.188]  When Trump won, it was kind of like, you know, a lot of these networks are like, well, what are we talking about now?
[03:53:22.188 --> 03:53:24.091]  I mean, everything's kind of going pretty good.
[03:53:24.091 --> 03:53:25.773]  It's what he said he was going to do is doing it right now.
[03:53:25.773 --> 03:53:26.593]  They don't get it.
[03:53:26.593 --> 03:53:27.254]  But they didn't know.
[03:53:27.254 --> 03:53:28.436]  The war only got 10 times worse.
[03:53:28.436 --> 03:53:30.498]  It got worse, and they failed miserably.
[03:53:30.498 --> 03:53:34.843]  I mean, it's just... Ali, one of our great analysts back there, Ali always makes great points.
[03:53:34.843 --> 03:53:37.766]  We had an Intel guy calling who's always been a great source earlier and point out,
[03:53:38.507 --> 03:53:47.393]  The big message today, you watch, with the head of Apple, the head of Google, everybody going to the White House is, the elite realize Trump's winning, they're going to get behind free market.
[03:53:47.393 --> 03:53:54.317]  A lot of elites are actually saying, I was talking to high-level people earlier this week, they're like, we were always going to be patriots, but the American people weren't ready.
[03:53:54.317 --> 03:53:56.018]  Globalists are getting ready to come over to our side.
[03:53:56.018 --> 03:53:58.659]  Bilderberg collapsed years ago.
[03:53:58.659 --> 03:54:01.261]  I know Cernovich knows about this, some of the same sources.
[03:54:03.291 --> 03:54:04.411]  They've gotten to that point.
[03:54:04.411 --> 03:54:06.012]  He said, watch the stock market.
[03:54:06.012 --> 03:54:08.893]  Since then, it's gone up 141 points.
[03:54:08.893 --> 03:54:10.253]  And again, that's about exuberance.
[03:54:10.253 --> 03:54:11.434]  That's about belief.
[03:54:11.434 --> 03:54:13.254]  That's about prosperity.
[03:54:13.254 --> 03:54:17.696]  We've got three and a half trillion dollars now in there.
[03:54:17.696 --> 03:54:24.058]  Again, a lot of stuff's closing on Main Street because of the internet sales and people moving out of, you know, brick and mortar.
[03:54:24.058 --> 03:54:26.319]  But other than that, the economy's coming back.
[03:54:26.319 --> 03:54:29.220]  What are they going to do?
[03:54:29.220 --> 03:54:31.601]  I just see, I'm seeing patriotism come back.
[03:54:31.601 --> 03:54:31.961]  I'm seeing
[03:54:33.126 --> 03:54:34.526]  Americanism coming back.
[03:54:34.526 --> 03:54:36.547]  You know, when I was in Florida... Hold on.
[03:54:36.547 --> 03:54:37.867]  Let the man at this.
[03:54:37.867 --> 03:54:41.228]  Joe, I really admire you and really care about you.
[03:54:41.228 --> 03:54:44.148]  Joe, I do not admire you!
[03:54:44.148 --> 03:54:45.389]  That's a Megyn Kelly interview.
[03:54:45.389 --> 03:54:45.649]  Sorry.
[03:54:45.649 --> 03:54:52.490]  Yeah, but I was just in Florida, you know, I saw people, trucks driving up and down the road, Trump flags, American flags, amped up.
[03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:53.710]  I mean, just like, wow!
[03:54:53.710 --> 03:54:56.451]  You know, just ready to go out there and just, they were just happy again.
[03:54:56.451 --> 03:54:58.531]  I mean, we haven't seen that in so long.
[03:54:58.531 --> 03:55:01.512]  And, you know, I think people are starting to come around and understand, you know what?
[03:55:01.932 --> 03:55:03.053]  It's not the end of the world.
[03:55:03.053 --> 03:55:06.257]  And it doesn't mean there's not some dark side to all the Trump stuff.
[03:55:06.257 --> 03:55:09.181]  The point is that nobody has a perfect side.
[03:55:09.181 --> 03:55:12.465]  We're simply trying prosperity again, which is better than North Korea.
[03:55:13.922 --> 03:55:15.942]  Cernovich, what do you have to say?
[03:55:15.942 --> 03:55:19.303]  Again, man, the young people coming up, I like what I see.
[03:55:19.303 --> 03:55:26.285]  They are being demoralized still, though something needs to come with student loan debt reform, which is something that I think is appalling.
[03:55:26.285 --> 03:55:35.827]  Oh, the president should come out and decriminalize marijuana, take it away from the left, and have a new program to cut debts and to cut the cost of tuition through competition.
[03:55:36.187 --> 03:55:37.448]  Bankruptcy reform.
[03:55:37.448 --> 03:55:42.350]  So if Trump wants to take the high road and just really raise hell, here's what I would do.
[03:55:42.350 --> 03:55:46.091]  I'd pardon Assange and say that you can have a refugee in America.
[03:55:46.091 --> 03:55:48.992]  And I would do this all in one night to just freak the media.
[03:55:48.992 --> 03:55:50.313]  I would trigger the media.
[03:55:50.313 --> 03:55:51.493]  I'd fire Mueller.
[03:55:51.493 --> 03:55:53.234]  I'd pardon Assange.
[03:55:53.234 --> 03:55:54.935]  By executive order, I would just say, you're pardoned.
[03:55:54.935 --> 03:55:55.975]  You can now come to America.
[03:55:55.975 --> 03:55:57.055]  You can leave Ecuador.
[03:55:57.055 --> 03:55:58.676]  We'll give you a safe passage.
[03:55:58.676 --> 03:56:00.117]  Just freak the media out.
[03:56:00.117 --> 03:56:03.998]  I would say, OK, we're not going to enforce any of the marijuana laws.
[03:56:03.998 --> 03:56:05.639]  Give Snowden the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[03:56:05.799 --> 03:56:19.472]  Yeah, give him the Congressional Freedom Honor, honor him as Snowden, bring him in for the Congressional Medal of Freedom, and then I would introduce, tell Congress, we want legislation to allow these young people to plead bankruptcy for the student loan debt.
[03:56:19.472 --> 03:56:21.394]  Because you can plead bankruptcy... Which they should!
[03:56:21.394 --> 03:56:22.415]  That is a genius plan.
[03:56:23.243 --> 03:56:27.165]  And then just do that all one night and the media is going to go, oh my god, what do we do?
[03:56:27.165 --> 03:56:32.488]  You would trigger the media into hysteria and they would be actually couldn't get out of bed.
[03:56:32.488 --> 03:56:39.491]  Their adrenal system would be so taxed from not knowing what to do and which master to serve that they would not be able to get out of bed.
[03:56:39.491 --> 03:56:43.373]  Because all liberal controllers want to do is like squat and pee on success.
[03:56:46.715 --> 03:56:48.497]  No, I'm serious.
[03:56:48.497 --> 03:56:51.820]  Like you see Obama, he like just squats and like pees on things.
[03:56:51.820 --> 03:57:00.387]  It just reminds me of a video of this Australian imam who's like yelling at his congregation because certain Muslims were caught using urinals.
[03:57:00.387 --> 03:57:02.449]  And he goes, you're supposed to pee in the street!
[03:57:02.449 --> 03:57:03.871]  Stop using the urinals!
[03:57:06.947 --> 03:57:08.568]  This is so funny.
[03:57:08.568 --> 03:57:09.308]  You're kidding, right?
[03:57:09.308 --> 03:57:10.428]  No, I'm dead serious.
[03:57:10.428 --> 03:57:12.309]  I have it.
[03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.909]  It's hilarious.
[03:57:12.909 --> 03:57:13.450]  Do it, Trump.
[03:57:13.450 --> 03:57:14.350]  Pardon Snowden.
[03:57:14.350 --> 03:57:15.510]  Pardon Assange.
[03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:16.031]  Fire me.
[03:57:16.031 --> 03:57:17.051]  No, no.
[03:57:17.051 --> 03:57:19.092]  Start peeing on the streets, President Trump.
[03:57:19.092 --> 03:57:26.114]  All at once, when everybody's asleep, two in the morning, sign it, have it all ready to go, and then just shock and awe.
[03:57:26.114 --> 03:57:26.915]  This will be a day long.
[03:57:26.915 --> 03:57:27.675]  Shock and awe.
[03:57:27.675 --> 03:57:29.716]  The media wouldn't even know what to do.
[03:57:29.716 --> 03:57:32.557]  Briefly, this is what funds the operation.
[03:57:33.379 --> 03:57:35.000]  We need the funding to expand.
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:37.201]  Free shipping store-wide for the next few days.

[03:58:03.643 --> 03:58:04.323]  Cuz I gotta do it.
[03:58:04.323 --> 03:58:06.344]  Cuz I'm in a craze mode.
[03:58:06.344 --> 03:58:09.066]  I'm gonna do a few live reports off and on, but I'll be off the next two days.
[03:58:09.066 --> 03:58:10.767]  Joe Biggs and others are coming in.
[03:58:10.767 --> 03:58:12.628]  Mike Cernovich, always great having you here in town.
[03:58:12.628 --> 03:58:13.248]  My pleasure.
[03:58:13.248 --> 03:58:15.209]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[03:58:15.209 --> 03:58:19.892]  And then, the great crew right behind us, putting up with me and the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:58:21.002 --> 03:58:23.943]  And it's just so exciting to be alive and be involved in all this.
[03:58:23.943 --> 03:58:25.123]  So please keep spreading the word.
[03:58:25.123 --> 03:58:30.944]  But I don't want to declare victory unless it's actually due, but it's not that I'm not pathetic.
[03:58:30.944 --> 03:58:33.145]  It's just Megyn Kelly is even more pathetic.
[03:58:33.145 --> 03:58:40.046]  This was a big victory, so... And congrats again to Saul for winning that big prize CNN is ISIS.
[03:58:40.046 --> 03:58:40.546]  Absolutely.
[03:58:40.546 --> 03:58:40.566]  $2,500.
[03:58:40.566 --> 03:58:41.166]  Great job.
[03:58:41.166 --> 03:58:43.947]  Alright, coming up tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:58:43.947 --> 03:58:45.087]  Spread the word, please.
[03:58:45.087 --> 03:58:45.887]  You are the resistance.
[03:58:45.887 --> 03:58:46.447]  You're the power.
[03:58:46.447 --> 03:58:48.248]  You're the reason we're all winning.
