[00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:16.837]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:27.650]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show in these historic times on planet Earth in the country known as the United States of America.
[00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.932]  Filling in for Alex Jones is Owen Troyer today.
[00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:33.954]  We will be hearing from Alex, I'm sure, at some point along the road.
[00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:38.397]  We will also be having Dr. Ed Group in studio for the last two hours.
[00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:39.237]  He will be joining me.
[00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:40.238]  We'll be talking health,
[00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:48.704]  Winning battles that we're winning right now in the health battle, making people healthier again, getting some of the poisons out of our food.
[00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:55.528]  But right now I've got stacks of news to cover, so just briefly we'll go over kind of the waterfront here.
[00:00:55.528 --> 00:01:00.992]  President Trump has a boost in the daily tracking polls.
[00:01:00.992 --> 00:01:03.394]  He's up to a 48% approval rating.
[00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:09.799]  That's not the highest he's been, but it's higher than he has been at any other point in I think the last seven days or so.
[00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:13.657]  You know, and I was sitting here thinking about this.
[00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:21.363]  I mean, my support of President Trump waivers, I would say right now it's probably close to about 90%.
[00:01:21.363 --> 00:01:33.971]  The 10% would be the foreign policies that I don't like, the Kushner negotiations that I don't like, or whatever influence Kushner has on this White House that none of us voted for.
[00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:40.496]  But I'm wondering, I'm scratching my head, what would Donald Trump's approval rating be without the fake news?
[00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:48.181]  What would Donald Trump's, what would President Trump's approval rating be without the fake news attacking him 24-7?
[00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:55.925]  And that's not just the fake news that's been attacking Donald Trump for the last two years.
[00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:59.627]  Also the Russia narrative.
[00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:00.828]  You know, I can't even believe this.
[00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:05.549]  Whether Seth Rich was the D.N.C.
[00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:14.796]  leaker to WikiLeaks or not, whether it was Seth Rich or not, there is literally more evidence that would point to it being Seth Rich than the Russians.
[00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:16.358]  Now, we're not getting that from the D.C.
[00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:17.398]  police, are we?
[00:02:17.398 --> 00:02:19.760]  We're not getting that from the FBI, are we?
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.887]  No, it has to be Americans on the Internet doing work for themselves, and now Sean Hannity, who is reporting on this for Fox, is backing off.
[00:02:27.887 --> 00:02:28.968]  We'll talk about Seth Rich.
[00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:30.229]  There's more developing on this.
[00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.124]  It's just, it's just, it's just crazy.
[00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:40.049]  And again, John Podesta, we found it in the WikiLeaks.
[00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:40.970]  Hmm.
[00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.270]  How?
[00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.554]  I don't even know if irony is the right word for this.
[00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:45.956]  I mean, Seth Rich.
[00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:48.378]  Here's a guy who's just a good old-fashioned American.
[00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:52.133]  Member of the Democrat Party who wants to see a fair election.
[00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:53.173]  That's all.
[00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.555]  How dare you interfere with Hillary Clinton stealing the election.
[00:02:56.555 --> 00:02:59.957]  But again, hey, maybe it wasn't Seth Rich.
[00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:08.522]  John Podesta said in the emails that he would make an example whether it was the leaker or not.
[00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.103]  No investigation into that.
[00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:15.251]  Instead, we're spinning tops looking for Russia all day long.
[00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:24.435]  And I'm sitting here thinking about this, and we'll talk with Ed Group about this, but people have literally gone completely mental.
[00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:26.736]  They have completely lost their minds.
[00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:34.059]  Think about all of the time, all of the energy, all of the resources that we're spending on this Russia investigation.
[00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:40.653]  And President Trump is sitting here handcuffed because here's a businessman who wants to cut the fat.
[00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.174]  He's already cutting into the budget.
[00:03:42.174 --> 00:03:43.074]  We'll talk about that.
[00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:44.115]  Taxpayer first.
[00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:45.195]  Budget cuts.
[00:03:45.195 --> 00:03:45.856]  That's good.
[00:03:45.856 --> 00:03:48.357]  We'll cover that.
[00:03:48.357 --> 00:03:52.740]  But he must be seeing this Russia investigation and wanting to pull his hair out.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.541]  What a waste of time.
[00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:56.283]  What a waste of money.
[00:03:56.283 --> 00:03:59.324]  What a total waste.
[00:03:59.324 --> 00:04:01.286]  We might as well be sending these people to the Hill
[00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:05.879]  To play cards or to play tiddlywinks with one another.
[00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.423]  Investigating the Russia probe for two years.
[00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:10.745]  I mean, what?
[00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:15.490]  And then they have the news that says, oh, well, it was Hillary that invented the Russia meddling thing.
[00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.452]  But it was.
[00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:21.197]  They knew that they were going to lose this election.
[00:04:21.197 --> 00:04:21.857]  OK, trust me.
[00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:29.477]  Alex Jones and Infowars and the people on the alt-right weren't the only people that knew Hillary was going to lose, folks.
[00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.098]  They knew she was done.
[00:04:31.098 --> 00:04:32.839]  They knew Hillary Clinton was doomed.
[00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.760]  That's why the fake news was so strong against Trump.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.801]  That's why they tried to steal the election.
[00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:40.283]  That's why they had to use superdelegates to keep Bernie out.
[00:04:40.283 --> 00:04:43.224]  Because Hillary never had a chance!
[00:04:43.224 --> 00:04:46.406]  The only chance she had was the fake news, and it failed her.
[00:04:46.406 --> 00:04:47.186]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:47.847]  Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:47.847 --> 00:04:49.788]  Owen Troyer filling in Alex Jones on the other side.
[00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:11.078]  Fox News has a new television host, and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories about Seth Rich.
[00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:17.960]  Let the Rich family get the closure that they need properly, and not with your crazy conspiracy theories on the internet.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.140]  Save them for Bigfoot.
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:28.944]  In the post-Roger Ailes era of the Fox News Network, Liberal Democrat host Julie Roginsky went after Seth Rich conspiracy theories.
[00:05:29.104 --> 00:05:32.086]  Listen, WikiLeaks was in collaboration with the Russians.
[00:05:32.086 --> 00:05:32.707]  How do we know this?
[00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:37.670]  Because the entire intelligence community said that the Russians were the ones that hacked into these emails.
[00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:46.736]  Meanwhile, evidence continues to surface that Seth Rich did, in fact, have contact with WikiLeaks before he was murdered.
[00:05:46.736 --> 00:05:55.062]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clinton crime family.
[00:05:55.062 --> 00:05:58.725]  I'm Darren McBreen, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.
[00:06:00.386 --> 00:06:10.977]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:06:10.977 --> 00:06:13.059]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:15.921]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:17.403]  It's made in the USA.
[00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:20.546]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:06:20.766 --> 00:06:24.208]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:26.289]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:35.994]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:48.541]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:48.962]  We're good.
[00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:14.574]  We're off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[00:07:14.574 --> 00:07:23.741]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:28.365]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.787]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman,
[00:07:31.187 --> 00:07:35.471]  20% off retail, sign up for auto ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:36.612]  It's all there.
[00:07:36.612 --> 00:07:40.715]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it.
[00:07:40.715 --> 00:07:42.056]  It's truly game changing.
[00:07:42.056 --> 00:07:52.805]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.407]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[00:07:55.407 --> 00:07:59.470]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:15.926]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:15.926 --> 00:08:19.231]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:08:27.543 --> 00:08:33.185]  The people of the United States, the people of the UK, the people of Europe and the world have a decision to make.
[00:08:33.185 --> 00:08:36.186]  Are we going to roll over to Islamic intimidation?
[00:08:36.186 --> 00:08:38.567]  Are we going to roll over to their censorship?
[00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:47.130]  Are we going to roll over to the past president that just left office saying don't use the word Islamic extremism or Islamic terror?
[00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:52.512]  We have been censored on our main Facebook page and also on Paul's page that have millions and millions of likes.
[00:08:54.036 --> 00:09:01.762]  Because Paul posted a article about how he's given all these death threats by Islamists and Facebook won't take it down.
[00:09:01.762 --> 00:09:05.585]  They won't take down the pages with hundreds of thousands of likes saying, kill Donald Trump.
[00:09:05.585 --> 00:09:12.911]  They'll only censor libertarians and conservatives and nationalists because we're telling the truth and our messages are strong.
[00:09:12.911 --> 00:09:14.232]  But we won't be censored by you.
[00:09:14.232 --> 00:09:15.513]  We won't be shut down by you.
[00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.894]  And then today they locked out our Facebook account.
[00:09:17.894 --> 00:09:20.877]  So we're not doing Facebook mentions because that's been taken from us.
[00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:32.796]  Because we violated community guidelines, pointing out that the leftists are saying just carry on, have a stiff upper lip, go have peace vigils with the Muslims.
[00:09:32.796 --> 00:09:42.343]  As if that's going to stop the Islamic attacks, when it's the governments themselves and the left that brought in these people and let them carry out the attacks and then cover up for them every single time.
[00:09:42.343 --> 00:09:45.365]  The people are sick of this and they're tired of it.
[00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:51.510]  But let me tell you something, I'm a lot more mad at the globalists and the social engineers and the UN population system.
[00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.112]  The whole U.N.
[00:09:53.112 --> 00:09:55.657]  refugee program that I am at The Islamicist.
[00:09:55.657 --> 00:10:04.013]  The globalists go to stabilize the Muslim countries, they destroy their borders, they then open up Europe, they have these people flood into their countries, and then they're...
[00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:15.793]  Basically prepped by leftists to then go out and carry out their jihad to intimidate the general population into giving up their rights to the central government police state to protect them.
[00:10:15.793 --> 00:10:17.094]  That's all this is.
[00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:33.063]  The real enemies here are the globalist social engineers that have been protecting radical orthodox Islam and turning it loose all over Africa, all over Asia, all over the Middle East, all over Central Asia to wreak havoc against non-radical Muslim countries like Iraq and like Syria.
[00:10:33.063 --> 00:10:33.363]  I think?
[00:10:50.536 --> 00:10:58.003]  And our Western men are taught to be cucked and passive and roll over, but the Muslim men can just run around and beat up and attack and rape and kill.
[00:10:58.003 --> 00:11:02.146]  And the liberals go give them roses when they do it in Stockholm and in Berlin.
[00:11:02.146 --> 00:11:15.018]  And they have anti-racism, pro-Islam rock concerts and the Muslim men just line up and just rape the women as they beg the police for help for hours on video and no one helps them because it's a sacrament to give into Islam.
[00:11:15.018 --> 00:11:15.759]  It's a sacrament
[00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:16.600]  We're good to go.
[00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:37.132]  And then Katy Perry comes out of her rat hole and says, no borders, no division.
[00:11:37.132 --> 00:11:40.574]  We will all come together when she has bodyguards and she's all protected.
[00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:45.077]  And these rich white liberals live in the most segregated white areas in the world.
[00:11:45.077 --> 00:11:49.199]  They are conquering everyone with their Islamic sword.
[00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:59.806]  Morrissey, a big liberal, but a classic liberal, came out and said, how dare you all, you live behind armed guards, just so you have some vigil and move forward and put smiley face avatars up or put your British flags up.
[00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:01.528]  Union Jacks.
[00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:09.120]  No, that's all just a salve by the very political elite that brought these people in knowing they come from third world hell holes where all they do is kill each other.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.203]  They're incompatible in their own damn religion.
[00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.012]  Ladies and gentlemen, on this Wednesday, understand this.
[00:12:15.012 --> 00:12:16.053]  They think you're broken.
[00:12:16.053 --> 00:12:16.934]  They think you're defeated.
[00:12:16.934 --> 00:12:26.823]  They think they can bring in millions of military-age men, have them rape, kill, bomb, do whatever they want, see our president go to the heart of Islam and say, no more Islamic terror.
[00:12:26.823 --> 00:12:27.944]  We're throwing down the gauntlet.
[00:12:27.944 --> 00:12:36.751]  They bomb the next day, showing just how absolutely arrogant they are and how they believe the whole world's theirs because we act like such cucked cowards.
[00:12:38.086 --> 00:12:47.193]  Because we act like such pathetic people that will roll over to the so-called religion of peace that is the religion of oppressing women and the religion of absolutely trafficking in slaves.
[00:12:47.193 --> 00:12:50.896]  They invented the African slave trade and then taught Westerners how to do it.
[00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:52.757]  So they teach in schools that the West did it.
[00:12:52.757 --> 00:12:56.980]  When the West ended it, everything is a giant, inverted, stinking fraud.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.582]  And I, for one, have had enough of it!
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:17.773]  And I look at the Grande lady who, where this event happened, calling for open borders, saying Trump's a terrorist, saying he terrifies her, and that she's not saying a word against ISIS or Islam right now, but they just blew up 22 of her fans and killed them with their guts and skin blown everywhere.
[00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:19.614]  Oh, but if I say that, I'll be banned off YouTube.
[00:13:19.614 --> 00:13:22.136]  You can't even talk about the victim's death and their blood.
[00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:26.453]  They want to show us people that have been nerve gats to start a Syrian war, gulping for air.
[00:13:26.453 --> 00:13:27.634]  That's okay, up close.
[00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:30.417]  But I just say they blew up these little girls and humanize them.
[00:13:30.417 --> 00:13:31.759]  We'll be banned, probably.
[00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:32.860]  Already off Facebook.
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.783]  Because you see, you don't humanize them.
[00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:38.927]  The other thing we got blocked on Facebook for, our account's frozen for videos.
[00:13:39.648 --> 00:13:40.188]  I don't think so.
[00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.371]  Think about that.
[00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:01.071]  Think about that.
[00:14:01.071 --> 00:14:02.532]  Think about how crazy they are.
[00:14:02.532 --> 00:14:03.753]  Think about how arrogant they are.
[00:14:03.753 --> 00:14:08.556]  Think about the mayor who said just get used to terrorism last year in London.
[00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.658]  The London stand new mayor, the Islamicist.
[00:14:12.287 --> 00:14:13.869]  He said he's proud of Islam and it's spread.
[00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:14.750]  He's not an Uncle Tom.
[00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.712]  He's here to let Islam take over.
[00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:20.156]  He hasn't repudiated ISIS or Al-Qaeda or any of it.
[00:14:20.156 --> 00:14:21.498]  He hasn't because you know what?
[00:14:21.498 --> 00:14:27.104]  He's the big politico that uses the terror to get more of your freedoms and more of your rights and more surveillance.
[00:14:27.104 --> 00:14:31.149]  In fact, they've got the British police everywhere cracking down on folks that even mildly criticize Islam.
[00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:31.950]  I don't know.
[00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:46.819]  It is so incredible to see their arrogance.
[00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:54.482]  And to see, even after her fans were blown up, 50 plus injured, 22 dead, that she won't even sit there and repudiate Islam.
[00:14:54.482 --> 00:15:05.546]  It's more attacking the West, saying we didn't surrender to Islam enough, we didn't cut off enough women's genitals, we didn't put enough hoods over women's heads, we didn't sit there and throw enough gay people off buildings.
[00:15:05.546 --> 00:15:07.867]  Seriously, that's the cuckold Stockholm syndrome.
[00:15:08.527 --> 00:15:15.472]  We didn't go to enough Islamic, you know, rock concerts and be raped to prove, you know, that Swedish women are sorry for being white.
[00:15:15.472 --> 00:15:30.924]  We didn't do enough and so we're so sorry to George Soros who runs the UN Migrant Council program with all these different globalist organizations and who literally has taxis out in North Africa from Libya bringing the jihadis over by the thousands every day.
[00:15:30.924 --> 00:15:34.746]  I mean, you cannot make this level of crap up.
[00:15:34.746 --> 00:15:36.448]  But then Morrissey comes out and tells the truth.
[00:15:37.557 --> 00:15:38.658]  So this is about survival.
[00:15:38.658 --> 00:15:40.239]  Do you have any survival instinct left?
[00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:42.920]  Let's look at some of these articles.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.321]  Here it is.
[00:15:43.321 --> 00:15:47.143]  Facebook punished me for complaining about the death threat.
[00:15:47.143 --> 00:15:49.184]  That's the one thing that Paul's been blocked out of his account for.
[00:15:49.184 --> 00:15:56.689]  You can also scroll down here and see the other thing about the girls being killed, where he just mentioned they were killed and saying, you know, all your peace vigils won't bring them back.
[00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:57.730]  Time to stand up.
[00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.452]  Because that's such truth, I'm not allowed to say it, you see.
[00:16:01.452 --> 00:16:04.654]  Continuing here, we've got the fact that
[00:16:06.127 --> 00:16:10.571]  The Muslim terrorists kill innocent young beautiful girls, but that's okay.
[00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:19.079]  White House blames exhaustion for Donald Trump's Islamic terrorism, dog whistle, because he wasn't supposed to say that, but he did say it's Islamic terror.
[00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:20.220]  So the media had both.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.423]  They said, oh, he was tired when he said it, but also he never said it.
[00:16:24.423 --> 00:16:25.925]  Oh, he backed off in Saudi Arabia.
[00:16:28.934 --> 00:16:31.355]  See, again, that's their total double-feak mind control.
[00:16:31.355 --> 00:16:33.136]  Remember the San Bernardino attack?
[00:16:33.136 --> 00:16:35.637]  They don't call it an Islamic terror attack.
[00:16:35.637 --> 00:16:37.457]  They just call it an attack.
[00:16:37.457 --> 00:16:39.698]  They went and shot people around the Christmas tree.
[00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:41.479]  Asked if they were Jewish and shot them.
[00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:42.279]  Nice attack.
[00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:45.040]  What we know about the Bastille Day killings.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.302]  Oh, not an Islamic attack, huh?
[00:16:48.302 --> 00:16:48.662]  On and on.
[00:16:48.662 --> 00:16:50.423]  That's the BBC.
[00:16:50.423 --> 00:16:51.563]  Orlando shooting.
[00:16:51.563 --> 00:16:51.883]  49 killed.
[00:16:51.883 --> 00:16:53.944]  Shooter pledges allegiance to ISIS.
[00:16:53.944 --> 00:16:55.985]  At least CNN, weeks later, finally got that straight.
[00:16:57.694 --> 00:17:02.677]  It's all up on InfoWars.com right now, ladies and gentlemen, breaking this down.
[00:17:02.677 --> 00:17:08.081]  Morrissey rips British politicians after Manchester attack petrified to admit Islamic extremism behind terror.
[00:17:08.081 --> 00:17:09.942]  There is anger is monumental.
[00:17:09.942 --> 00:17:12.444]  For what reason will this ever stop?
[00:17:12.444 --> 00:17:15.706]  He goes into talk about why is the left so allied with Islam?
[00:17:15.706 --> 00:17:17.787]  You're never going to be able to shut us down.
[00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:18.228]  And look at this.
[00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:25.911]  Katie Perry with all her bodyguards and all the rest of it says, no barriers, no borders, we all just need to coexist.
[00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:29.793]  Hey, Katie, can you go to Saudi Arabia and walk around in your Egyptian outfit?
[00:17:29.793 --> 00:17:32.094]  No, you'll be put in a slave pit.
[00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:34.215]  Katie, can you walk around kissing girls in Saudi Arabia?
[00:17:34.215 --> 00:17:34.995]  No, you'll be executed.
[00:17:35.695 --> 00:17:37.896]  Can your gay dancers go around in Saudi Arabia?
[00:17:37.896 --> 00:17:38.836]  No, they'll be thrown off cliffs.
[00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:40.716]  They'll be thrown off the top of buildings.
[00:17:40.716 --> 00:17:43.157]  Hey, Katie, can you go to Syria and live in peace?
[00:17:43.157 --> 00:17:44.617]  Can you go to Libya and live in peace?
[00:17:44.617 --> 00:17:50.939]  No, because our government wouldn't put radical Muslims in to sell women into slavery and murder hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:58.060]  But that's OK, because you shoot your mouth off about no barriers when you've got a big wall around your mansion and you've got at least seven or eight bodyguards.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.721]  I've seen you out in Austin before who pack guns.
[00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:04.322]  But of course, you don't support the Second Amendment either, only for your big fat
[00:18:04.862 --> 00:18:07.746]  Pathetic satanic ass!
[00:18:07.746 --> 00:18:08.807]  You're sick!
[00:18:08.807 --> 00:18:12.070]  And you're a cuck to anything that you see as criminal and alpha!
[00:18:13.087 --> 00:18:14.107]  Alpha is a criminal.
[00:18:14.107 --> 00:18:17.708]  Alpha is strong and stands for what's right and goes against the peer pressure.
[00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:26.929]  And I will not submit to the peer pressure of orthodox Islam or the left and its death cult that hates the West and hates real Christianity and hates prosperity and hates open free societies.
[00:18:26.929 --> 00:18:37.071]  This whole embrace of Islam and hajib signs all over Austin saying wear your hajib at Gap and everywhere else is about an assault on free societies and free will.
[00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:41.432]  And it's an assault on everything that's held true in the Renaissance.
[00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.134]  And we will NEVER submit to Islam!
[00:18:44.134 --> 00:18:45.435]  Islam means submission!
[00:18:45.435 --> 00:18:47.617]  We will NEVER submit to the god of death!
[00:18:47.617 --> 00:18:49.999]  We will NEVER submit to the god of suppressing women!
[00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:54.884]  We will NEVER submit to George Soros and his Nazi-loving, satanic death cult either!
[00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.606]  All of you are going to the ash heap of history!
[00:18:57.606 --> 00:19:00.449]  We're gonna have a reformation in Islam!
[00:19:00.449 --> 00:19:02.831]  Some say Al-Qaeda and ISIS is his reformation.
[00:19:02.831 --> 00:19:05.994]  Well then, if that's his reformation, I'll tell you what the cure is to it.
[00:19:07.168 --> 00:19:08.809]  I'm Alex Jones for InfoWars.com.
[00:19:08.809 --> 00:19:11.411]  Back to Owen Schroer, the rest of the crew at the live feed.

[00:19:16.795 --> 00:19:19.256]  Because there's a reason we're enemy number one with the globalists.
[00:19:19.256 --> 00:19:25.961]  Because we've got the white hot sword of truth and we're chopping their lives into big giant masses of garbage.
[00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:27.862]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:19:27.862 --> 00:19:28.443]  Spread that link.
[00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:33.132]  So there you go folks, Alex Jones breaking it down.
[00:19:33.132 --> 00:19:46.858]  And again, the truth of the matter is, you have the left that claims to be tolerant, claim they're for women's rights, for homosexual rights, yet they side on the side of radical Islam that throws them off buildings.
[00:19:46.858 --> 00:19:49.500]  I love what he said about Katy Perry, that is absolutely correct.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.782]  We'll be right back with more on the Manchester and what's developing on that terrorist attack on the other side of this break.
[00:20:00.362 --> 00:20:01.622]  Maybe not today.
[00:20:01.622 --> 00:20:02.903]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:20:02.903 --> 00:20:06.664]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[00:20:09.565 --> 00:20:11.266]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[00:24:25.282 --> 00:24:28.243]  Yeah, we need to figure out what the hell is going on.
[00:24:28.243 --> 00:24:31.765]  Just saying tolerance and changing your avatar is not going to do anything.
[00:24:31.765 --> 00:24:37.507]  So, I'm going to try to put my understanding of what is going on
[00:24:39.284 --> 00:24:42.430]  And we'll hear from callers later on in the show.
[00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.073]  I'm sure we'll hear from Alex on this too.
[00:24:44.073 --> 00:24:45.696]  So, what you have is...
[00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:55.079]  You've got the Middle East, which is rich in resources, but people that seem to be in conflict all the time.
[00:24:55.079 --> 00:25:12.128]  So what you have is governments in Europe and in the Western world want to impose regime change so that perhaps private, I don't know, oil companies or central banks can come into these countries, establish their way, and establish the Western way of life.
[00:25:13.052 --> 00:25:28.305]  And when it doesn't go the way we like, well, we have bombs being dropped, or we have to stage events like 9-11, or we have to lie about what happens on 9-11 in order to move into the Middle East and get these agendas going.
[00:25:28.305 --> 00:25:29.506]  So then, what happens?
[00:25:29.506 --> 00:25:40.835]  You have ticked off people in the Middle East because we're trying to come in, and then we have people that hate us already, so they're preaching to their youth how bad we are, and they're preaching hate against the Western world, hate against the European world.
[00:25:40.835 --> 00:25:41.335]  So then,
[00:25:42.532 --> 00:25:55.182]  Liberal morons open up their borders to these very people, and then they come into their countries, and they inflict violence, they inflict death, and they bring pain and suffering to these nations.
[00:25:55.182 --> 00:25:58.544]  So that's what's going on, as far as my understanding.
[00:26:01.792 --> 00:26:06.375]  It's ridiculous that you can't... See, it's like the same debate.
[00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:11.639]  It's like having a debate about global warming, but not mentioning that geoengineering is going on.
[00:26:11.639 --> 00:26:22.607]  We're going to sit here and debate global warming, anthropogenic global warming, oh yes, but we're going to actually ignore the literal anthropogenic global warming that's going on, spraying chemicals in the air.
[00:26:23.643 --> 00:26:28.987]  We're going to ignore all that, but we're going to talk about how humans are warming the planet.
[00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:33.270]  It's like, OK, you know, we're going to talk about all these different things.
[00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.531]  Oh, there's terrorist attacks here.
[00:26:34.531 --> 00:26:35.432]  There's terrorist attacks here.
[00:26:35.432 --> 00:26:36.233]  We're invading here.
[00:26:36.233 --> 00:26:38.675]  We're infiltrating regime changes here.
[00:26:38.675 --> 00:26:40.496]  Well, it's all connected.
[00:26:40.496 --> 00:26:41.637]  And Donald Trump said it.
[00:26:41.637 --> 00:26:42.618]  What the hell is going on?
[00:26:42.618 --> 00:26:44.499]  We need to figure out what the hell is going on.
[00:26:44.499 --> 00:26:47.882]  But for the safety of your country at this point, you want to close the borders.
[00:26:48.462 --> 00:26:50.503]  They're calling it an invasion of Europe.
[00:26:50.503 --> 00:26:51.703]  That is correct.
[00:26:51.703 --> 00:26:53.504]  We are at war right now.
[00:26:53.504 --> 00:26:59.746]  Whether you like it or not, whether they're going to say that or not, there is a civil war going on right now in Washington, D.C.
[00:26:59.746 --> 00:27:08.569]  and there is cold war, hot wars going on for regime change against terrorism, which is a nice thing that they can call it, so that they can keep these wars going on.
[00:27:08.569 --> 00:27:10.110]  So there's all these different angles.
[00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.791]  Of course there's radical extreme Islam.
[00:27:12.791 --> 00:27:17.973]  Of course what's going on in the Middle East and some regimes is inhumane and we shouldn't tolerate that.
[00:27:18.733 --> 00:27:24.977]  On the other hand, you can't let these people into your country because we're bombing them!
[00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:34.444]  Donald Trump signs a travel ban from seven countries that were bombed for eight years under the Obama regime.
[00:27:34.444 --> 00:27:38.486]  Yes, that would make sense, wouldn't it?
[00:27:38.486 --> 00:27:40.227]  So it's time to figure out what's going on.
[00:27:40.227 --> 00:27:45.871]  But when these people keep flooding into Europe, flooding into America, it just makes the situation worse.
[00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:47.032]  And as Alex said,
[00:27:48.663 --> 00:28:00.989]  You ruin the society, you bring the culture to ruins, and then you have people begging for the police state because they just want to feel safe if they can leave their house.
[00:28:00.989 --> 00:28:01.870]  Which, look at the news.
[00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.931]  So here's all the news, I don't even get to it.
[00:28:04.931 --> 00:28:12.095]  A man gets arrested, there's a knife man who gets arrested as the Queen is going down the road.
[00:28:13.629 --> 00:28:17.814]  The armed guards in England had to arrest him.
[00:28:17.814 --> 00:28:28.869]  And so now there's security everywhere and Manchester bombing triggers security crackdown with soldiers scrambled to patrol Westminster as they joined armed cops in race to foil imminent second attack.
[00:28:28.869 --> 00:28:29.590]  So that's nice.
[00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.452]  Another attack that would have killed a bunch of young people.
[00:28:32.352 --> 00:28:37.255]  The police have now said, it's clear we're investigating a network.
[00:28:37.255 --> 00:28:43.239]  And so now they're raiding homes, they're making arrests, they've got all these leads, it looks like maybe they're finally doing something.
[00:28:43.239 --> 00:28:47.601]  Maybe the bombing at the Ariana Grande concert was finally the last straw.
[00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:53.465]  Oh yeah, and so, by the way, and then you, and then you, see, it's just, it's so ridiculous, it's so messed up.
[00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:58.868]  These refugees are going into Europe, they're getting taxpayer-funded
[00:29:01.235 --> 00:29:02.478]  Stipends.
[00:29:02.478 --> 00:29:06.707]  And then, they go on vacation back to the countries that they fled.
[00:29:08.117 --> 00:29:10.018]  You've never heard of such a crazy thing.
[00:29:10.018 --> 00:29:12.860]  So again, this policy is just ridiculous.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.762]  This open border policy is just ridiculous.
[00:29:15.762 --> 00:29:19.605]  And it doesn't stop there, but that's one issue that needs to be addressed.
[00:29:19.605 --> 00:29:28.291]  So now in France, they have now heightened their state of emergency with the very high threat France set to extend state of emergency.
[00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:33.295]  And now here in America, a false alarm at a baseball game in Atlanta
[00:29:34.625 --> 00:29:37.327]  So everybody's on edge now, everybody's worried.
[00:29:37.327 --> 00:29:41.711]  And I'm just curious, when will Hollywood change its stance?
[00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:49.457]  If people stop going to movies, stop going to concerts, stop going to ballgames, maybe Hollywood and the establishment will change their stance when people are afraid.
[00:29:49.457 --> 00:29:51.579]  Although they'll just bring in the police state, you'll beg for it.
[00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:53.321]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:55.983]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:11.130]  Fox News has a new television host, and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories about Seth Rich.
[00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:18.015]  Let the Rich family get the closure that they need properly, and not with your crazy conspiracy theories on the internet.
[00:30:18.015 --> 00:30:19.195]  Save them for Bigfoot.
[00:30:19.195 --> 00:30:22.798]  In the post-Roger Ailes era of the Fox News Network,
[00:30:23.078 --> 00:30:29.145]  Liberal Democrat host Julie Roginsky went after Seth Rich, conspiracy theorist.
[00:30:29.145 --> 00:30:32.108]  Listen, WikiLeaks was in collaboration with the Russians.
[00:30:32.108 --> 00:30:32.749]  How do we know this?
[00:30:32.749 --> 00:30:37.655]  Because the entire intelligence community said that the Russians were the ones that hacked into these emails.
[00:30:37.995 --> 00:30:46.757]  Meanwhile, evidence continues to surface that Seth Rich did in fact have contact with WikiLeaks before he was murdered.
[00:30:46.757 --> 00:30:54.840]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clinton crime family.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.901]  I'm Gary McBreen, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:01.598 --> 00:31:07.081]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:31:07.081 --> 00:31:07.921]  I take this.
[00:31:07.921 --> 00:31:09.062]  My family takes this.
[00:31:09.062 --> 00:31:13.344]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.

[00:31:17.947 --> 00:31:22.590]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:23.711]  I don't feel good.
[00:31:23.711 --> 00:31:27.473]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:31:27.473 --> 00:31:30.175]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:31:30.175 --> 00:31:35.959]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:31:35.959 --> 00:31:38.921]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:42.463]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:31:42.463 --> 00:31:44.705]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:31:44.705 --> 00:31:45.065]  I love it.
[00:31:45.205 --> 00:31:48.009]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:31:48.009 --> 00:31:49.030]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:54.979]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:56.861]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:58.103]  It's a win-win.
[00:31:58.103 --> 00:31:59.064]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:15.034]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:32:15.034 --> 00:32:17.357]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[00:32:17.857 --> 00:32:21.820]  is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:34.171]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.

[00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:09.951]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:09.951 --> 00:33:14.634]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:14.634 --> 00:33:18.776]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:18.776 --> 00:33:25.079]  In America's 240-plus year history,
[00:33:36.257 --> 00:33:52.123]  We have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord, right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:33:52.123 --> 00:34:00.527]  And that's what Memorial Day is really all about, is remembering the servicemen and women that have given their lives in service to this country.
[00:34:00.527 --> 00:34:01.487]  And I'll be honest with you.
[00:34:02.524 --> 00:34:07.610]  I was brought up supporting our military and supporting the troops.
[00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:16.120]  But hearing how great America was and how wonderful Texas was and how we were the best growing up, I kind of saw that as a little bit arrogant.
[00:34:17.935 --> 00:34:36.118]  Until I traveled the world, and until I studied the news around the world, and found out that as bad as America is in some cases, we are so much better than places like North Korea, and Venezuela, and what the Russians were under, and the Soviet Union, and so many other case point examples.
[00:34:36.118 --> 00:34:41.599]  There are few countries that are as good as the United States of America.
[00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:46.240]  And there are certainly none that are as diverse and vibrant in their histories.
[00:34:47.236 --> 00:34:50.258]  That's why people from all over the world wanted to come here.
[00:34:50.258 --> 00:35:02.525]  Because this is a place where no matter what color you are, or what your family background was, or whether you were rich or poor, you could really do true independent things at a level never before seen.
[00:35:02.525 --> 00:35:05.367]  Infowars is the classic Americana story.
[00:35:05.367 --> 00:35:06.407]  22 years old,
[00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:18.094]  This organization that I started when I was 21 has really changed the course of history, not because of what I did, but because of what you, the listeners and viewers did.
[00:35:18.094 --> 00:35:28.538]  I was simply bringing back classic Americana and challenging the controlled left and the globalists and the controlled right who are trying to bring in this whole corporate system of
[00:35:28.558 --> 00:35:33.641]  We're serving the establishment and not having true diversity of thoughts and ideas.
[00:35:33.641 --> 00:35:39.304]  And we see political correctness assaulting our institutions, assaulting our free speech.
[00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:50.250]  And that's why as we approach Memorial Day, it's more important than ever in 2017 to realize we're in the middle of a giant historical power struggle.
[00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:55.653]  Because we grew out of the tectonic forces of liberty and tyranny colliding.
[00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:56.554]  And the Great Mountain
[00:35:57.816 --> 00:36:17.768]  That is our republic that was far above all the other nation states and peoples of the world with invention and low taxes and a level playing field is now sinking into the sands of time, into an ocean of oblivion, into the quagmire of oligarchies and special interests.
[00:36:18.885 --> 00:36:25.553]  And those oligarchs recognize something in Infowars that threatens them and threatens them greatly.
[00:36:25.553 --> 00:36:26.835]  And it's that we're bonafide.
[00:36:26.835 --> 00:36:27.616]  We're legitimate.
[00:36:27.616 --> 00:36:28.697]  We're real.
[00:36:28.697 --> 00:36:30.759]  I'm not reading off a teleprompter.
[00:36:30.759 --> 00:36:32.722]  I'm certainly not perfect and I make mistakes.
[00:36:32.722 --> 00:36:34.384]  But I believe in prosperity.
[00:36:34.384 --> 00:36:35.745]  I believe in free market.
[00:36:35.745 --> 00:36:37.187]  I believe in religious freedom.
[00:36:37.187 --> 00:36:38.168]  I believe in Jesus Christ.
[00:36:39.477 --> 00:36:43.582]  And so the globalists see that as competition because I'm a free man.
[00:36:43.582 --> 00:36:49.948]  I'm an empowered man who wants to live out my own destiny and wants to see you live that out.
[00:36:49.948 --> 00:36:52.191]  I don't feel bad when I see you being successful.
[00:36:52.191 --> 00:36:53.652]  I feel empowered.
[00:36:53.652 --> 00:36:55.034]  Just like you do that as well.
[00:36:55.034 --> 00:36:59.739]  The globalists, they want winners and losers and they want to pick the winners and losers.
[00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:01.381]  They don't want a non-zero some game.
[00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:12.853]  And that's why in hundreds and hundreds of publications a day, they put out outrageous lies about us, or they cherry-pick what I've said out of context to misrepresent what we're doing.
[00:37:12.853 --> 00:37:25.696]  Because if they can destroy the idea of Infowars, and of Alex Jones, yours truly, they can destroy the idea of any man, or any woman, being an independent individual and changing history.
[00:37:26.916 --> 00:37:38.586]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a sacred birthright as Americans of a race, color, and creed to trailblaze in the future for future generations, just as past generations did for us.
[00:37:38.586 --> 00:37:48.375]  And that's why, during this Memorial Day, I want to thank the veterans that have fought, but of course, most importantly, those that have died, because that's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[00:37:49.659 --> 00:37:54.660]  Is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.120]  Didn't mean every war was good.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.721]  Didn't mean they didn't get conned.
[00:37:57.721 --> 00:37:59.641]  Didn't mean they didn't get used.
[00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:03.442]  But I'm here to tell you, they were at least people that were willing to stand up for something.
[00:38:03.442 --> 00:38:11.264]  And that's worlds apart from so many of the trendies and globalist wannabes and minions of the establishment that want to take the easy road.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:23.945]  That easy road leads into stagnation, leads into collapse, leads into enslavement, leads into humiliation, and poverty, and betrayal.
[00:38:23.945 --> 00:38:41.833]  And as for me, the greatest part about my quest to promote liberty and freedom is that I have met men and women, again, of every race, color, and creed, who all bleed red blood, and who are of one race, the human race, who have a dream to have a better future for our children, just like Martin Luther King talked about.
[00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:44.853]  And that dream is closer than ever.
[00:38:44.853 --> 00:38:51.564]  That's why the forces of evil are pushing their system of tyranny harder than we've ever seen.
[00:38:51.564 --> 00:38:53.908]  And that's why as we approach this Memorial Day, I want to...
[00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:58.971]  Thank all the InfoWarriors out there that have made this broadcast possible.
[00:38:58.971 --> 00:39:05.133]  And that's why I want to also have a promotion here to help fund our operation in the face of these attacks.
[00:39:05.133 --> 00:39:17.399]  That is one of the biggest sales in our history at InfoWarriorStore.com, where you'll get great, high-quality, game-changing products that also help us continue in the face of the enemy onslaught.
[00:39:17.799 --> 00:39:21.940]  That again is attempting to shut down our free speech and ultimately your free speech.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:29.561]  Take advantage of these unprecedented specials and help support the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists while supplies last.
[00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:38.963]  Our highest quality name brand silver bullet that we private label is already the highest quality and lowest price of what we sell it at.
[00:39:38.963 --> 00:39:41.584]  And I've never offered it as a loss leader.
[00:39:42.344 --> 00:39:43.906]  Like I'm about to do.
[00:39:43.906 --> 00:39:49.234]  At 65% off retail right through next Tuesday.
[00:39:49.234 --> 00:39:51.277]  Supermell Vitality has been sold out for months.
[00:39:51.277 --> 00:39:53.721]  Our number one best-selling product.
[00:39:53.721 --> 00:39:54.622]  I normally just give 25% off.
[00:39:56.283 --> 00:40:03.150]  We are doing 30% off Super Metal Vitality out of the gates through next Tuesday.
[00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:09.536]  Survival Shield, high quality, true nascent iodine, deep earth crystal source, has been sold out.
[00:40:09.536 --> 00:40:12.459]  We never offer it at 40% off.
[00:40:12.459 --> 00:40:19.927]  It's offered at 40% off for a limited time to again celebrate our patriots and celebrate those that died in the service of this great republic.
[00:40:20.694 --> 00:40:26.878]  Brain Force, now with 20% more in each bottle, is 47% off.
[00:40:26.878 --> 00:40:29.680]  We've, again, never offered it at that.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.561]  It's a bestseller.
[00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:31.722]  It's been sold out.
[00:40:31.722 --> 00:40:33.523]  Why am I discounting it?
[00:40:33.523 --> 00:40:35.424]  Because I know it's a tough economy out there.
[00:40:35.424 --> 00:40:38.346]  I know the globalists have been trying to stop the Trump recovery.
[00:40:38.346 --> 00:40:39.988]  And I know this is a powerful product.
[00:40:39.988 --> 00:40:44.191]  And so if you try it, I think you're going to continue to want to buy it.
[00:40:44.191 --> 00:40:48.874]  Especially if you sign up for AutoShip, that's an additional 10% off.
[00:40:48.874 --> 00:40:49.875]  When you add that in,
[00:40:51.429 --> 00:40:53.810]  The 65% off silver bullet.
[00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.591]  It is a loss leader then for sure.
[00:40:55.591 --> 00:40:59.173]  You add that to the 30% off super male, that's 40% off.
[00:40:59.173 --> 00:41:03.115]  You add that to survival shoulder, 40%, that's 50% off.
[00:41:03.115 --> 00:41:06.736]  You add that to brain force at 47, that's 57% off.
[00:41:06.736 --> 00:41:09.638]  You add that to secret trouble at 43%, our vitamin B12 mythical bottleman, that is 53%.
[00:41:09.638 --> 00:41:10.958]  Knockout is at 50%, our sleep aid, that's 60%.
[00:41:10.958 --> 00:41:12.139]  We've never offered it at that.
[00:41:19.062 --> 00:41:24.305]  And all InfoWars Trump shirts are 75% off retail as well.
[00:41:24.305 --> 00:41:25.966]  To get the word out.
[00:41:25.966 --> 00:41:29.368]  These are the biggest sales ever on these items.
[00:41:29.368 --> 00:41:32.710]  You add AutoShip, several of these are lost leaders.
[00:41:33.666 --> 00:41:37.067]  But that's a win-win for all of us because it makes you healthy.
[00:41:37.067 --> 00:41:39.068]  You try these products and find out how good they are.
[00:41:39.068 --> 00:41:40.528]  You sign up for AutoShip.
[00:41:40.528 --> 00:41:42.209]  You continually support us.
[00:41:42.209 --> 00:41:44.930]  That's what this is all about, is building our own economy.
[00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:47.171]  Having our own communities.
[00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:48.711]  Funding the good guys.
[00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:50.832]  That's why the globalists don't want free market.
[00:41:50.832 --> 00:41:52.633]  That's why they want insider deals.
[00:41:52.633 --> 00:41:54.534]  That's why they want to shut Infowars down.
[00:41:54.534 --> 00:41:58.075]  Because they can't compete with a level playing field.
[00:41:58.835 --> 00:42:09.023]  Now obviously, those that made the ultimate physical sacrifice are way above those of us that just make the sacrifice in our families, in our daily lives, and with our names to take on the globalists.
[00:42:09.023 --> 00:42:11.225]  But make no mistake, it is a war.
[00:42:11.225 --> 00:42:18.671]  And so I want to commend all of you that have spread the word about Infowars, and that have stood up for the broadcast, and that have prayed for us, because I know you get attacked as well.
[00:42:18.671 --> 00:42:21.213]  And I want to thank you for purchasing the products.
[00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:29.779]  And for continually supporting us, those of you who have been with us sometimes for more than 20 years, just understand that without you, there'd be nothing.
[00:42:29.779 --> 00:42:35.743]  So when I thank you for your support, it's not because I'm patronizing you, it's because you are the InfoWarp.
[00:42:35.743 --> 00:42:39.065]  And you're the reason we've had the success we've had.
[00:42:39.065 --> 00:42:40.887]  So without you, there's nothing.
[00:42:40.887 --> 00:42:47.452]  So for myself and the entire InfoWarp crew, I salute you and thank you for all your prayers and all your support on this Memorial Day.
[00:42:47.452 --> 00:42:50.534]  Hope everybody has a safe weekend coming up.
[00:42:52.031 --> 00:43:03.500]  And I hope and pray that all of you work as hard as you can to wake up as many people as you can because if you don't engage in the info war and take it to the next level, if I don't as well, we're going to lose this thing.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.480]  It's that close.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.482]  We're on the knife's edge right now.
[00:43:06.482 --> 00:43:07.983]  We are in that crucible.
[00:43:07.983 --> 00:43:09.044]  We are in that fulcrum.
[00:43:09.044 --> 00:43:10.525]  We are at that crossroads.
[00:43:30.622 --> 00:43:34.144]  Take advantage of those specials at Infowarsstore.com, folks.
[00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:48.009]  Some of the best specials we've ever offered in honor of Memorial Day, and those who have served this country, died for this country, died for the freedoms that we have in this country, that people at Berkeley University are willing to throw in the trash.
[00:43:48.009 --> 00:43:49.329]  What a bunch of scum.
[00:43:49.329 --> 00:43:50.510]  Hey!
[00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:51.050]  Shocking!
[00:43:52.438 --> 00:44:02.681]  BBC News told members of the public called the anti-terrorism hotline warning about the Manchester bomber several years ago.
[00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:05.242]  How do you like that?
[00:44:05.242 --> 00:44:06.722]  Shocking!
[00:44:06.722 --> 00:44:07.242]  Shocking!
[00:44:07.242 --> 00:44:08.683]  Oh, wait!
[00:44:08.683 --> 00:44:10.923]  He was known to law enforcement?
[00:44:10.923 --> 00:44:13.204]  Shocking!
[00:44:13.204 --> 00:44:14.324]  Oh, wait!
[00:44:14.324 --> 00:44:18.866]  He traveled to Libya before?
[00:44:18.866 --> 00:44:19.326]  Shocking!
[00:44:20.233 --> 00:44:22.576]  There's no pattern of events here at all.
[00:44:22.576 --> 00:44:24.538]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:44:24.538 --> 00:44:25.859]  No pattern of events here.
[00:44:25.859 --> 00:44:26.921]  But you know what?
[00:44:26.921 --> 00:44:38.434]  CNN decided that they were going to go ahead and go full mental and they blamed the alt-right or the right wing for this attack at the concert.
[00:44:38.434 --> 00:44:39.555]  Guys, go ahead and roll this clip.
[00:44:49.068 --> 00:44:52.210]  Alright, so we're still going to go ahead and wait on that clip then.
[00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.971]  So we'll just go ahead and move forward then.
[00:44:54.971 --> 00:45:02.155]  So, we've got now the Seth Rich thing is taking on entirely new levels, folks.
[00:45:02.155 --> 00:45:06.277]  It's reached new proportions on Fox News, new proportions on the internet.
[00:45:07.377 --> 00:45:15.940]  Kim Dotcom making statements now, and you have the left, which is still busy looking for Russian collusion up each other's butts.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:28.345]  They're just ignoring it, they're saying it's fake news, even though there's more evidence that it was Seth Rich, whether it was or not, there is more evidence that would lead you to believe it's Seth Rich, than there are to lead you to believe that it was Russia.
[00:45:28.345 --> 00:45:31.286]  But, as I've said, this has taken new levels.
[00:45:33.086 --> 00:45:35.628]  Family of DNC staffer Seth Rich.
[00:45:35.628 --> 00:45:37.650]  He's more than just a DNC staffer by the way.
[00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:41.593]  I hate how they just say DNC staffer.
[00:45:41.593 --> 00:45:42.954]  He's more than just DNC staffer.
[00:45:42.954 --> 00:45:48.738]  He was in charge of voter rolls and voter reach out and he was in the tech.
[00:45:48.738 --> 00:45:49.459]  He was into tech.
[00:45:49.459 --> 00:45:53.021]  He's very IT savvy as well.
[00:45:53.021 --> 00:45:59.787]  So the family is asking the DC police to reveal details of its murder investigation or the lack of.
[00:46:01.061 --> 00:46:09.507]  And I think that this is a, you know, again, we've seen the video of Seth Rich's parents on the internet, we've heard about the private eye, the retraction, all of this craziness.
[00:46:10.598 --> 00:46:17.600]  But perhaps, maybe this is, and I don't even know, I'm not in contact with Seth Rich's parents.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.280]  I just want to find out the truth about this.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:27.543]  I think that there's a deep, deep corruption going on here and a whole list of body counts that they all may be tied together, known as the Clinton body count.
[00:46:27.543 --> 00:46:39.726]  But apparently, Sean Hannity, who is talking to the Rich family, has said that he's going to back off of his reporting on it and his investigation because that's what the family has requested.
[00:46:41.055 --> 00:46:44.719]  Again, I've not had that request or been in contact with the family.
[00:46:44.719 --> 00:46:50.325]  I certainly don't want to upset them, but it is my understanding that...
[00:46:51.607 --> 00:47:04.872]  They want independent investigation going on on this because they're not getting what they want out of the DC police and that would lead me to believe why they make this announcement asking the DC police to reveal investigation details.
[00:47:04.872 --> 00:47:07.413]  Or again, the lack thereof.
[00:47:07.413 --> 00:47:12.075]  But so, it goes on to a new level now and Sean Hannity has gone on to Twitter.
[00:47:12.075 --> 00:47:14.476]  He said, spoke to many advertisers.
[00:47:14.476 --> 00:47:17.457]  They are being inundated with emails to stop advertising on my show.
[00:47:18.308 --> 00:47:20.631]  This is Soros, Clinton, Brock, Liberal, Fascism.
[00:47:20.631 --> 00:47:21.932]  Yes, Sean Hannity.
[00:47:21.932 --> 00:47:23.354]  Welcome to the club, brother!
[00:47:23.354 --> 00:47:28.380]  Media Matters is hoping advertisers will give in to the pressure and they will silence freedom of speech.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.642]  Liberals, do you support this effort?
[00:47:30.642 --> 00:47:33.245]  Well, yeah, they do support this effort because you support Trump.
[00:47:33.245 --> 00:47:38.852]  But, this is something that I think is starting to reach
[00:47:41.033 --> 00:47:47.157]  More echelons than just InfoWars.com and really starting to wake people up.
[00:47:47.157 --> 00:47:49.939]  Because there are true liberals still out there.
[00:47:49.939 --> 00:47:53.602]  They may be tricked or brainwashed, but they do still exist.
[00:47:53.602 --> 00:47:57.245]  And when they see this attack on free speech, no matter who it is,
[00:47:59.255 --> 00:48:00.776]  It does send up red flags.
[00:48:00.776 --> 00:48:15.308]  So, yeah, InfoWars has been under attack by Media Matters and all these consortium of fake news collaborators saying we're fake news, but now Sean Hannity is really getting the pressure upped on him.
[00:48:15.308 --> 00:48:18.631]  Why would that be going on?
[00:48:18.631 --> 00:48:21.133]  Couldn't be because of his Seth Rich reporting.
[00:48:21.133 --> 00:48:21.933]  No, no, no.
[00:48:21.933 --> 00:48:23.975]  Couldn't have anything to do with that.
[00:48:23.975 --> 00:48:27.398]  I'm sure that that has nothing to do with it at all.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.783]  Hey, by the way, David Brock, you know, I've actually interviewed Andrew Kerr before.
[00:48:32.783 --> 00:48:38.406]  Andrew Kerr did a great investigative report on David Brock and all of his packs.
[00:48:38.406 --> 00:48:43.869]  This guy, he is, I mean seriously, this guy is doing some shady stuff to be polite.
[00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:57.078]  He's got all of his PACs, all of his super PACs in DC, all located in the same office, all funneling money back and forth between one another, while he takes a hit off of every money exchange.
[00:48:57.078 --> 00:49:02.402]  So he and his super PACs are taking a hit, they're taking in the donations, they're funneling them in between one another.
[00:49:02.642 --> 00:49:04.563]  Who's all located in the same office.
[00:49:04.563 --> 00:49:06.604]  They're all making out like millionaires.
[00:49:06.604 --> 00:49:10.786]  Meanwhile, they're trying to shut down real news because they want the fake news.
[00:49:10.786 --> 00:49:17.430]  Because the fake news isn't going to report on David Brock's super PACs laundering money!
[00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:18.731]  Allegedly.
[00:49:18.731 --> 00:49:24.154]  So now, Andrew Kerr has put out another report on David Brock.
[00:49:24.154 --> 00:49:28.896]  Is David Brock's foundation falsifying expenditures?
[00:49:28.896 --> 00:49:29.596]  Shocking!
[00:49:29.596 --> 00:49:31.898]  I would have never believed!
[00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.692]  Not David Brock!
[00:49:35.692 --> 00:49:37.173]  Not David Brock.
[00:49:37.173 --> 00:49:39.795]  Oh my gosh.
[00:49:39.795 --> 00:49:41.136]  So you know what?
[00:49:41.136 --> 00:49:42.497]  I'll actually reach out to Andrew Kerr.
[00:49:42.497 --> 00:49:48.140]  I'll see if he can maybe come on and talk to me about this for the Nightly News or something.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.201]  But now you see it.
[00:49:49.201 --> 00:49:52.503]  Again, you report on Seth Rich on Hannity.
[00:49:52.503 --> 00:49:56.466]  You report on perhaps some deep state things going down.
[00:49:56.466 --> 00:49:58.968]  Some election fraud going down.
[00:50:00.399 --> 00:50:01.419]  And well, what do you know?
[00:50:01.419 --> 00:50:03.780]  You're attacked by David Brock.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:04.921]  Another pattern.
[00:50:04.921 --> 00:50:06.761]  There's all these patterns forming.
[00:50:06.761 --> 00:50:09.603]  Why do people just ignore these patterns, folks?
[00:50:09.603 --> 00:50:10.843]  Okay, so we'll play this video.
[00:50:10.843 --> 00:50:13.284]  You guys got the CNN clip ready before we go to break?
[00:50:13.284 --> 00:50:18.346]  This is CNN blaming the right wing on the Ariana Grande concert bombing.
[00:50:18.968 --> 00:50:30.880]  It's also been noted that in recent months in Europe there have been a number of false flag plots where right-wing extremists have tried to frame Islamists for terrorism.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.881]  We've seen that in Germany.
[00:50:32.924 --> 00:50:33.785]  Inflamed.
[00:50:33.785 --> 00:50:36.747]  The right wing is inflaming Islamists.
[00:50:36.747 --> 00:50:45.455]  If they want to come on and say they're being inflamed by fake wars and proxy wars and now more weapons going in the region, okay, maybe I can understand.
[00:50:45.455 --> 00:50:47.176]  But to just blame the right wing?
[00:50:47.176 --> 00:50:49.718]  Well, you're clearly out of your mind, CNN.
[00:50:49.718 --> 00:50:52.601]  We'll be right back with more of the Alex Jones Show on the other side of this break.
[00:50:52.601 --> 00:50:54.683]  Infowarsstore.com, support this broadcast.

[00:54:10.545 --> 00:54:13.008]  The lanes in the middle.
[00:54:13.008 --> 00:54:17.012]  The places where you used to play.
[00:54:32.263 --> 00:54:38.046]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here on the road, I'm in Florida doing a fabulous job here at the Infowars News Center.
[00:54:38.046 --> 00:54:42.388]  Yeah, Austin, Texas, and you notice that Don Henley song, Inside Job.
[00:54:42.388 --> 00:54:51.853]  Using Inside Job, the Western governments are bringing in radical Islamists, allowing them to attack, for two plus years he was known to be an Islamist, planning attacks, his family.
[00:54:52.493 --> 00:54:53.434]  I actually spoke out.
[00:54:53.434 --> 00:54:55.656]  People ask why Muslims don't speak out.
[00:54:55.656 --> 00:55:00.160]  The governments, in Europe especially, will not ever stand up against it.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.302]  Then they let the attacks take place.
[00:55:02.302 --> 00:55:03.584]  Then they take the public's freedom.
[00:55:03.584 --> 00:55:09.509]  And then they get up there, whether it's conservative or liberal prime ministers in England, and say, stiff up or let up.
[00:55:09.509 --> 00:55:10.690]  We're going to be strong.
[00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:11.431]  We're going to move forward.
[00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:12.872]  We're going to come together.
[00:55:12.872 --> 00:55:14.654]  You can't come together with a rattlesnake.
[00:55:15.305 --> 00:55:31.671]  It's in your bed, biting you, but you just keep saying, I love the rattlesnake, I love the rattlesnake, I love the black widow, I love the water moccasin, or I was going to do it, and I would keep saying, I'm going to come together with Hitler, he's going to stop killing me, or a conservative or Christian in a Soviet gulag.
[00:55:31.671 --> 00:55:40.875]  That's not how this works, and so, when they get up there on TV and say, just put little emojis of British flags, just say you stand with them,
[00:55:42.034 --> 00:55:49.318]  Just stand with a pop singer, you know, who invited all this, and who said, bring in the Muslims, you know, Katy Perry and all of them.
[00:55:49.318 --> 00:55:56.262]  It'd be like sitting there, punching your kid in the face, saying, stiff upper lip, let me just break your nose again, knock your teeth out.
[00:55:56.989 --> 00:56:03.795]  And Stephen Crowder is doing a great job doing a one minute fake press conference that's basically exactly what the British government said.
[00:56:03.795 --> 00:56:05.416]  And this is sick!
[00:56:05.416 --> 00:56:09.500]  And this is the Conservative government that at least wants to slow these viruses coming in.
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:10.581]  At least wants to affect them.
[00:56:10.581 --> 00:56:18.367]  So I've got to give Prime Minister May some credit for achieving a least worst form of cancer.
[00:56:18.367 --> 00:56:22.391]  But here's Crowder breaking down how asinine this Mast-Stockholm Syndrome is.
[00:56:24.156 --> 00:56:28.698]  Yes, I do wish that we were meeting under less unfortunate circumstances.
[00:56:28.698 --> 00:56:49.285]  Before we get to questions, for those asking the proper steps to be taken at this current moment, given how little information is known, we will advise you on the proper precautionary measures, which is most important, thoughts and prayers to the families affected, and of course, naturally, changing your Twitter avatar.
[00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:54.339]  Yeah, what about the reports that ISIS has taken responsibility?
[00:56:54.339 --> 00:56:55.941]  No, no.
[00:56:55.941 --> 00:56:59.825]  We can't comment on that, of course, because these topics are of a sensitive nature.
[00:56:59.825 --> 00:57:02.268]  We'd hate for people to go off with opinions half-cocked.
[00:57:02.268 --> 00:57:09.236]  However, we can advise you, given the current situation, the best measures to be taken still remains.
[00:57:10.302 --> 00:57:11.603]  Changing your Twitter avatar.
[00:57:11.603 --> 00:57:16.788]  Yeah, the man you have detained, is it true he has ties to Islamic terrorism?
[00:57:16.788 --> 00:57:18.970]  No, let's not use that word.
[00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:20.491]  Inflammatory language.
[00:57:20.491 --> 00:57:27.778]  And I will say, regardless of the motive, that does not... And it just goes on from there.
[00:57:27.778 --> 00:57:29.019]  That's just a short clip.
[00:57:29.019 --> 00:57:32.402]  He's got a larger one on his side, but I saw that and retweeted that.
[00:57:32.402 --> 00:57:33.884]  The real Alex Jones on Facebook, so...
[00:57:35.318 --> 00:57:40.962]  This is mind control, folks, and they're trying to get us to accept this and to go along with this.
[00:57:40.962 --> 00:57:46.206]  When I criticize our government, I'm not criticizing the rank-and-file, but the social engineers on top.
[00:57:46.206 --> 00:57:48.828]  Now, Dr. Grubbs, Army veteran, patriot.
[00:57:49.625 --> 00:57:51.046]  He was already coming into COAS today.
[00:57:51.046 --> 00:58:01.912]  He's on health issues and he wants to shift gears with Ellen and play a bunch of clubs, take their calls, and cover this terror attack and the fact that we're seeing more is imminent.
[00:58:01.912 --> 00:58:03.733]  Well again, they keep asking why is it happening.
[00:58:03.733 --> 00:58:05.354]  It's because they've brought these people in.
[00:58:05.974 --> 00:58:08.915]  We're trying to break our will and make us submit to it, and we're not going to.
[00:58:08.915 --> 00:58:10.536]  So Owen, you take back over.
[00:58:10.536 --> 00:58:11.616]  I'm back tomorrow live.
[00:58:11.616 --> 00:58:13.337]  You guys are doing a fabulous job.
[00:58:13.337 --> 00:58:19.459]  And again, I want to thank our listeners and our affiliates for allowing us to stand up for America and stand up for free speech.
[00:58:19.459 --> 00:58:22.240]  But again, back to Owen Troyer from the InfoWars News Center.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.180]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:25.221]  They're trying to censor us on Facebook right now.
[00:58:25.221 --> 00:58:28.482]  They blocked our live streams because we're criticizing Islam.
[00:58:28.482 --> 00:58:29.622]  Help us get the truth out.
[00:58:29.622 --> 00:58:31.083]  If we don't stand together, we won't
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:36.143]  Yeah, and we don't have to accept political correctness.
[00:58:36.143 --> 00:58:42.028]  We don't have to accept open borders and the clash of civilizations.
[00:58:42.028 --> 00:58:44.250]  That is what is going to lead to our demise.
[00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:47.572]  That is going to lead to the demise of our culture.
[00:58:47.572 --> 00:58:48.273]  We take a break.
[00:58:48.273 --> 00:58:49.234]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:50.379 --> 00:58:57.847]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:58:57.847 --> 00:59:11.062]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:59:11.983 --> 00:59:23.895]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:59:23.895 --> 00:59:29.860]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[00:59:52.687 --> 00:59:55.328]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.123 --> 01:00:21.225]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.225 --> 01:00:25.526]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.526 --> 01:00:27.607]  Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex today.
[01:00:28.567 --> 01:00:31.788]  He is on the road, working hard as always.
[01:00:31.788 --> 01:00:37.511]  We're about to be joined by Dr. Group, and we're going to cover some current events with Dr. Group.
[01:00:37.511 --> 01:00:41.332]  We're going to play some clips here, and we're going to talk about health issues.
[01:00:41.332 --> 01:00:54.258]  Dr. Group has some health victories that he is seeing happening right now, which is good for us to be getting healthier, because I think that a lot of the problems that we're facing right now is due to poor health.
[01:00:55.274 --> 01:01:02.696]  And I want to talk to Dr. Group about how physical health can lead to mental health, whether that be good or bad.
[01:01:02.696 --> 01:01:15.299]  But just look at the current psychological madness that we are experiencing in this country with Stockholm Syndrome, just the confirmation bias, the fake news propaganda.
[01:01:15.299 --> 01:01:17.119]  Look at what it has built.
[01:01:17.119 --> 01:01:24.381]  And I've tried to take all this down and look at this from a centrist point of view, non-biased, to just say, hey, look,
[01:01:25.569 --> 01:01:27.691]  This is double-think in the flesh.
[01:01:27.691 --> 01:01:30.573]  This is psychological madness in the flesh.
[01:01:30.573 --> 01:01:39.699]  No matter where you stand politically, we should at least be able to logically reason that, hey, this is double-think.
[01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:41.560]  There's something wrong with these people's minds.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.502]  So, for an example, and this happens all the time.
[01:01:44.502 --> 01:01:46.984]  I just wanted to put together this list to try to understand it here.
[01:01:48.143 --> 01:02:09.852]  Again, we've got media, we've got people, we've got politicians crying Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia collusion, all this Russia collusion, investigation ongoing, 17 intelligence agencies, yet somehow they can't put any proof out there, somehow they can't present any evidence, yet, whether it was Seth Rich or not, there's more evidence that it was Seth Rich, so imagine all the time spent
[01:02:10.532 --> 01:02:18.564]  By our government, by the media, by these people protesting, all this time spent on fake news that is the Russian collusion theory.
[01:02:19.665 --> 01:02:37.374]  Fake news started by the Democrats to make an excuse for Hillary Clinton and to begin the delegitimization process of President Trump, which they are continuing to ongo.
[01:02:37.374 --> 01:02:44.078]  So that's our tax dollars at work investigating fake news to discredit our president that we put in power.
[01:02:44.078 --> 01:02:45.859]  Now, you also have a group of people
[01:02:46.789 --> 01:03:03.365]  That preach women's rights, homosexual rights, and overall tolerance, yet they have allied with radical Islam and Sharia law, or they will tell you that radical Islam doesn't exist, but they're upset if you say there's only two sexes!
[01:03:04.679 --> 01:03:11.841]  Again, this is just common sense logic that just somehow befuddles these people.
[01:03:11.841 --> 01:03:33.706]  If you say that Donald Trump is a misogynist, or I'm sorry, this same group of people will say that Donald Trump is a misogynist, yet they voted or would vote for Hillary Clinton, who's married to Bill Clinton, who settled multiple rape cases, whose assistant, Huma Abedin, was married to Anthony Weiner, who is guilty for sexting young teenagers.
[01:03:34.798 --> 01:03:37.890]  But Trump's the misogynist, folks.
[01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:40.320]  Again, this is mental madness.
[01:03:41.536 --> 01:03:44.377]  And now this is something that I'm just now seeing.
[01:03:44.377 --> 01:03:48.558]  And I am a news junkie, a political news junkie.
[01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:51.738]  I'm literally monitoring mainstream news like 24-7.
[01:03:51.738 --> 01:03:54.259]  Even right now on my computer, I've got three broadcasts up.
[01:03:54.259 --> 01:04:00.520]  I've never seen this before in the over four years that I've been obsessed with covering this stuff.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:07.362]  CNN, MSNBC, and the Washington Post have literally become a cyclical echo chamber.
[01:04:08.447 --> 01:04:12.170]  It gets reported in the Washington Post, then CNN and MSNBC cover it.
[01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:15.712]  It gets reported in New York Times, then CNN and MSNBC cover it.
[01:04:15.712 --> 01:04:18.034]  Then the next day, Washington Post has a twist on it.
[01:04:18.034 --> 01:04:25.979]  Then the next day, the New York Times has a twist on it, which all of these are probably coming from leaks, which I think Trump is going to address when he comes back to D.C.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:33.181]  So you've got this echo chamber of CNN, MSNBC, fake news from the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[01:04:33.181 --> 01:04:35.202]  And they're fortifying their own madness.
[01:04:35.202 --> 01:04:39.703]  They're fortifying their own fake news by reporting on it all day long.
[01:04:39.703 --> 01:04:43.043]  And it doesn't matter that they're wrong almost all the time.
[01:04:43.043 --> 01:04:49.165]  They still think that they're real and people still believe them because they report on each other's fake news.
[01:04:49.165 --> 01:04:53.465]  So we're going to talk about this mental madness and what's leading to it with Dr. Group on the other side of this break.
[01:04:53.465 --> 01:04:55.326]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.326 --> 01:04:55.966]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:05:00.911 --> 01:05:10.633]  Fox News has a new television host, and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories about Seth Rich.
[01:05:10.633 --> 01:05:17.535]  Let the Rich family get the closure that they need properly, and not with your crazy conspiracy theories on the internet.
[01:05:17.535 --> 01:05:18.715]  Save them for Bigfoot.
[01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:28.537]  In the post-Roger Ailes era of the Fox News Network, Liberal Democrat host Julie Roginsky went after Seth Rich conspiracy theorists.
[01:05:28.677 --> 01:05:31.658]  Listen, WikiLeaks was in collaboration with the Russians.
[01:05:31.658 --> 01:05:32.299]  How do we know this?
[01:05:32.299 --> 01:05:37.241]  Because the entire intelligence community said that the Russians were the ones that hacked into these emails.
[01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:46.305]  Meanwhile, evidence continues to surface that Seth Rich did, in fact, have contact with WikiLeaks before he was murdered.
[01:05:46.305 --> 01:05:54.648]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clinton crime family.
[01:05:54.648 --> 01:05:58.270]  I'm Darren McBreen, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.

[01:06:05.515 --> 01:06:07.617]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:07.617 --> 01:06:12.901]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:12.901 --> 01:06:16.644]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:06:16.744 --> 01:06:20.186]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:20.186 --> 01:06:23.388]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:23.388 --> 01:06:27.250]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:34.414]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:34.414 --> 01:06:39.817]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:06:40.077 --> 01:06:42.118]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[01:06:42.118 --> 01:06:50.423]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.

[01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.474]  That means it's clean.
[01:07:50.474 --> 01:07:51.597]  That means it's pure.

[01:08:11.346 --> 01:08:17.020]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.346]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.016 --> 01:08:30.237]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:30.237 --> 01:08:33.319]  Owen Schroer and Dr. Ed Group with you.
[01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:38.261]  And on the way out of the last break, Dr. Group, I was explaining this.
[01:08:38.261 --> 01:08:41.242]  What I view is genuine mental disorders.
[01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:49.807]  I really think that there is something going on here where people are experiencing, whether it be brainwashing or, you know, mindwashing, whatever they want to say, mind control.
[01:08:50.387 --> 01:08:54.450]  It's very real, it's very palpable, and I think that there's a reason for it.
[01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:59.494]  Obviously, there's a psy-op going on with the fake news, but Dr. Grube, I think that there's more to it.
[01:08:59.494 --> 01:09:11.364]  I think that there is chemicals that are being put in the food and the water, whether it be intentional or not, they are there, and I think that this is also adding to some of the madness that these people are experiencing right now.
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.262]  It definitely adds to the madness.
[01:09:14.262 --> 01:09:26.355]  I mean, if you look at the world the way it is right now, you have, look at all these terrorist attacks, the fear, the political instability right now around the world.
[01:09:26.355 --> 01:09:30.659]  I mean, every single person that we talk to, and you can look at the
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:35.703]  You can look on Google, you can look at the psychiatric reports coming out.
[01:09:35.703 --> 01:09:40.506]  You have the majority of the population which are suffering from mental illness.
[01:09:40.506 --> 01:09:43.968]  Yeah, and then you have the majority of college students that are getting prescription pills.
[01:09:43.968 --> 01:09:45.289]  That doesn't help either.
[01:09:45.289 --> 01:09:52.894]  You have babies being diagnosed and mothers being given medications for depression while they have babies in the womb right now.
[01:09:52.894 --> 01:10:00.940]  I mean, the whole goal is to get everybody on medications and even most medications, believe it or not, contain fluoride and fluoride is damaging to the pineal gland.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:22.863]  And you can link a lot of these mental disorders to, obviously, what we've done and what we've been telling people about for years and years and years is the fluoride, the phthalates, the chemicals in the air that they're spraying from the chemtrails, the chemicals and toxins in the food supply, the chemicals in the water supply, the beverages that people are drinking, the parasites.
[01:10:23.584 --> 01:10:25.365]  It's all linked to mental illness.
[01:10:25.365 --> 01:10:31.510]  Look at all the studies that have come out lately on gut health and how gut health is linked to mental illness as well.
[01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:39.736]  It's just, it's really sad when you see so much corruption and so much devastation that's happening in the world right now.
[01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:47.342]  But the good news is we are accomplishing these victories, these small victories that are taking place.
[01:10:47.342 --> 01:10:48.083]  I just pulled up
[01:10:48.823 --> 01:11:00.151]  An article from CVS or an article in Teen Vogue actually and it's CVS announces removal of harmful chemicals from beauty products and we've been saying for a long time, Owen,
[01:11:01.098 --> 01:11:07.722]  It's we the people that are creating the change in America and around the world these days.
[01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:21.350]  The retail chain will be removing all products containing harmful known toxins like parabens and phthalates as well as the most common formaldehyde contributors from their store-based beauty products.
[01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:23.371]  This will go into effect in 2019 over nearly 600 beauty products.
[01:11:27.173 --> 01:11:39.451]  And according to Sia Tucci, the Vice President of Store Brands and Quality Assurance, it all comes back to listening to the customer and what they truly want.
[01:11:39.451 --> 01:11:43.357]  You know, we've always been saying, and Alex has said for a long time too,
[01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.335]  We are the ones that are making the difference.
[01:11:47.335 --> 01:12:00.339]  We are the ones that are focusing on changing the world and we're the ones that are out there refusing to buy these products.
[01:12:00.339 --> 01:12:01.980]  And it's amazing to me because you talk about
[01:12:02.779 --> 01:12:03.299]  Disreport
[01:12:22.535 --> 01:12:23.255]  Hey!
[01:12:23.255 --> 01:12:25.136]  We're not poisoning you anymore!
[01:12:25.136 --> 01:12:26.197]  Congratulations!
[01:12:26.197 --> 01:12:27.918]  You've woken up to the poisoning.
[01:12:27.918 --> 01:12:30.219]  We've decided not to poison you anymore.
[01:12:30.219 --> 01:12:38.963]  And I think that that has a lot to do with some of the madness we're seeing here, just with the psychological issues that people are dealing with in this country with the double think.
[01:12:38.963 --> 01:12:41.024]  And you know, one of them, Alex talked about this earlier.
[01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:42.705]  We're going to play this video clip, Dr. Group.
[01:12:43.703 --> 01:12:53.871]  So you have a terrorist attack in Manchester, England, and I asked the question, when will Hollywood change their stance on open border and liberal policies?
[01:12:53.871 --> 01:13:00.636]  Will it be when there's more movie theater attacks or more concert attacks and people quit going to concert and movies or ballgames?
[01:13:00.636 --> 01:13:01.957]  Will they stop it then?
[01:13:01.957 --> 01:13:06.020]  Well, Katy Perry came out and perhaps answered that question right off the bat.
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.783]  This was Katy Perry's response to the attack in Manchester.
[01:13:09.523 --> 01:13:10.964]  Back to concerts.
[01:13:10.964 --> 01:13:15.087]  Of course, the news from Manchester, from Ariana Grande's outside of her concert last night.
[01:13:15.087 --> 01:13:24.235]  You go through these phases of you're in shock, you're afraid, and then you're mad, and then you want to do something about it.
[01:13:24.235 --> 01:13:27.537]  And the first thing I thought of this morning was, I can't wait to go to a concert.
[01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:33.642]  I just want to prove to the world that we need to get together and have festive get-togethers like your tour that you just announced.
[01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:34.743]  What are your thoughts on that?
[01:13:36.358 --> 01:13:41.644]  You know, I can't really tell anyone else how they should feel, but I just feel devastated.
[01:13:41.644 --> 01:13:42.204]  Yeah?
[01:13:42.204 --> 01:13:42.685]  Yeah.
[01:13:42.685 --> 01:13:43.205]  Yeah.
[01:13:43.205 --> 01:13:44.767]  And so you should.
[01:13:44.767 --> 01:13:45.588]  We all should.
[01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:47.610]  It's a sad thing.
[01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:54.417]  People getting together for what is supposed to be the elevating show, and you know what?
[01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:55.158]  They will continue.
[01:13:55.158 --> 01:13:58.501]  The thing of it is that, you know, besides all the
[01:14:00.129 --> 01:14:11.393]  Weird stuff that goes around on the internet, which is, you know, sometimes a great place, but an absolute, you know, underbelly mob pit of horribleness.
[01:14:11.393 --> 01:14:16.714]  I think, like, the greatest thing that we can do now is just unite as people.
[01:14:16.714 --> 01:14:18.555]  As, like, fan bases.
[01:14:18.555 --> 01:14:19.395]  All of it, you know?
[01:14:19.395 --> 01:14:21.015]  Because I think, like, as much
[01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:25.557]  I got news for you, Katy Perry.
[01:14:25.557 --> 01:14:27.978]  ISIS isn't in your fan base.
[01:14:27.978 --> 01:14:30.298]  They're not in Ariana Grande's fan base.
[01:14:30.298 --> 01:14:32.859]  They want to blow that fan base up.
[01:14:32.859 --> 01:14:39.021]  The greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other and like no barriers, no borders.
[01:14:39.021 --> 01:14:40.421]  No barriers, no borders.
[01:14:40.421 --> 01:14:42.242]  We all need to just coexist.
[01:14:42.242 --> 01:14:42.482]  Coexist.
[01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:45.729]  You know what, Dr. Drew?
[01:14:45.729 --> 01:14:49.496]  I think I'm gonna go coexist with some poisonous rattlesnakes in a cage for an hour.
[01:14:49.496 --> 01:14:51.981]  I'm just, I'm gonna bring in my heart with love.
[01:14:51.981 --> 01:14:54.065]  I'll be fine, right?
[01:14:54.065 --> 01:14:55.388]  Yeah, you'll probably die.
[01:14:55.388 --> 01:14:56.129]  I mean, uh...
[01:14:57.096 --> 01:15:01.020]  Yeah, it's the breaking news obviously, the Manchester scenario.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:08.067]  So what do you think is gonna, what do you think that the main... Well, here's what I'm noticing, Dr. Group, and I think that this is universal.
[01:15:08.067 --> 01:15:11.990]  I mean, any human being that has a soul left is heartbroken by this.
[01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:13.752]  They're heartbroken by the images.
[01:15:13.752 --> 01:15:17.616]  They're heartbroken by the fact that it's almost reached a point where we're numb to it now.
[01:15:17.616 --> 01:15:21.880]  It happens, there was a study that I think every nine days now in Europe,
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.821]  There's a terror-related incident.
[01:15:23.821 --> 01:15:25.683]  I mean, that is all heartbreaking stuff.
[01:15:25.683 --> 01:15:30.366]  Everybody seems to be heartbroken, but nobody wants to change anything.
[01:15:30.366 --> 01:15:33.189]  Nobody wants to address the root of the issue.
[01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:37.312]  Now, the root of the issue probably goes way, way, way, way deep.
[01:15:37.312 --> 01:15:50.402]  You know, deep, deep, decades, decades old conflicts that have been going on here that are now being used by globalists to try to bring in unity of these countries and open borders and everything and eventually the police state.
[01:15:50.402 --> 01:15:51.403]  But it's amazing because
[01:15:52.063 --> 01:15:57.064]  Everyone's heartbroken, everybody's upset, but they don't ever mention the issue.
[01:15:57.064 --> 01:16:01.305]  They just say, oh love, oh peace, oh everything's fine.
[01:16:01.305 --> 01:16:03.586]  No, everything is obviously not fine.
[01:16:03.586 --> 01:16:05.687]  That approach has not been working.
[01:16:05.687 --> 01:16:13.469]  So I think there's a lot of issues here, Dr. Groot, but I think the first thing that you can do is say, there is an issue.
[01:16:13.469 --> 01:16:18.110]  If you can't even admit that there's an issue, I mean, they won't even say the words radical Islamic terror.
[01:16:19.545 --> 01:16:22.948]  Whatever the cause of it is, they won't even say that it exists.
[01:16:22.948 --> 01:16:27.432]  So if you can't admit that there's a problem, how are you ever going to address that there's a problem?
[01:16:27.432 --> 01:16:29.014]  That's what I've been saying for a long time.
[01:16:29.014 --> 01:16:31.596]  It's about addressing the root cause of the problem.
[01:16:31.596 --> 01:16:39.123]  And when you look at the majority of the conflict that we're dealing with today, first you have to ask yourself, who created ISIS?
[01:16:39.123 --> 01:16:41.365]  I mean, and that's a whole other subject that we can go down.
[01:16:42.862 --> 01:16:49.147]  What is the root cause of the problem and how to effectively fix the situation instead of continuing on and on and on?
[01:16:49.147 --> 01:16:53.931]  I can remember when I was growing up, you never heard about these things.
[01:16:53.931 --> 01:17:08.443]  I mean, now it's so commonplace that there's some terrorist attack or there's something going on practically every week that you just, you know, it's just a whole new segment for a week and then you just move on to the next terrorist attack and then you move on to the next terrorist attack and it's just...
[01:17:09.426 --> 01:17:23.429]  Especially if you don't confront the situation head on and you say, okay, these are radical Islamic individuals that are hurting and maiming people and creating fear in society.
[01:17:23.429 --> 01:17:35.972]  And you say, oh, you know, the UK reports that come out and say, oh, this is just a soccer player or this is just an individual and they, you know, it's not politically correct to say anything or to blame anybody for anything.
[01:17:36.232 --> 01:17:39.054]  Or to look into any investigation or any warnings.
[01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:39.775]  Right.
[01:17:39.775 --> 01:17:46.921]  You know, I always wonder what happens to these guys that are involved in all these suicide bombings and everything.
[01:17:46.921 --> 01:17:49.683]  You never hear about what happens to them.
[01:17:49.683 --> 01:17:51.965]  And it's never followed up on after that.
[01:17:51.965 --> 01:17:52.986]  It's a tragic event.
[01:17:52.986 --> 01:17:54.126]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:17:54.126 --> 01:17:57.769]  And to me, I look at it as how is that going to affect
[01:17:58.683 --> 01:18:14.326]  The consciousness of the planet and how is that going to affect the health of individuals and it's just another big damaging thorn in society because what happens when you're stressed out about something?
[01:18:14.326 --> 01:18:16.047]  Your immune system drops 50%.
[01:18:16.047 --> 01:18:19.467]  I mean, now people are going to be scared to go outside their homes?
[01:18:19.467 --> 01:18:25.829]  Are we going to be living in a society later on where you feel like you can't even walk down the street because you have to watch out there might be a bomb going off?
[01:18:27.409 --> 01:18:31.050]  You know, people don't understand what's going on in Europe because they've never been there.
[01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:35.191]  And of course, for a lot of people in Europe, probably daily life goes on as normal.
[01:18:35.191 --> 01:18:36.572]  But this is a slow progress.
[01:18:36.572 --> 01:18:38.992]  This is slowly happening now in England.
[01:18:38.992 --> 01:18:43.114]  You have armed guards protecting, you know, landmarks and such.
[01:18:43.114 --> 01:18:47.675]  And, you know, I think what might be going on here, Dr. Group, is the political left
[01:18:49.269 --> 01:19:04.183]  is so deeply into this group think they're so deeply in the hive mindset that they can't go against radical Islam because even in the threat of their consciousness Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are so tied in with ISIS
[01:19:05.004 --> 01:19:10.528]  You know, just in the threat of consciousness, those two names, Clinton and Obama, are so tied in with ISIS.
[01:19:10.528 --> 01:19:20.114]  Those two names, just in the last eight to ten years, are so tied in with the regime change in the Middle East, that because these are the politicians they support, they don't want to go against ISIS.
[01:19:20.114 --> 01:19:28.139]  They don't want to call out radical Islamic terror, because A, it's politically incorrect, but B, you know what, maybe their leaders, maybe their candidates, might have something to do with it.
[01:19:28.139 --> 01:19:29.580]  So they don't want to call them out.
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:33.023]  Yeah, I mean, I think that as things start to unfold,
[01:19:34.043 --> 01:19:51.670]  You know, and as the consciousness wakes up and more information is released to the public, we've studied all this stuff for years and years and years, but obviously there's a big, huge fight going on right now, and I think that, I'm hoping at least, that the public will start to learn how deep this goes, this swamp in Washington.
[01:19:51.670 --> 01:19:53.490]  No, wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we have to preempt this.
[01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:55.251]  I need to look into a Russia collusion.
[01:19:55.251 --> 01:19:58.893]  They are trying to put in every office of every country in the whole world.
[01:19:58.893 --> 01:20:00.053]  We're going to look into this on the other side.

[01:20:59.531 --> 01:21:01.372]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:21:01.372 --> 01:21:07.937]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:21:07.937 --> 01:21:11.099]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.

[01:21:21.666 --> 01:21:26.729]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:21:26.729 --> 01:21:28.831]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:21:29.111 --> 01:21:32.253]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:21:32.253 --> 01:21:37.377]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:21:37.377 --> 01:21:45.483]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:21:45.483 --> 01:21:53.229]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.

[01:22:58.217 --> 01:23:02.680]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.282]  Those times may be near.
[01:23:04.282 --> 01:23:05.182]  Think about it.
[01:23:05.182 --> 01:23:09.786]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:23:09.786 --> 01:23:14.450]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:20.575]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:23:20.575 --> 01:23:27.280]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.842]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:23:30.282 --> 01:23:33.085]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:25:35.806 --> 01:25:39.128]  I actually took some BrainForce right before I came on air.
[01:25:39.128 --> 01:25:43.571]  BrainForce, probably what every liberal needs, but won't get it.
[01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:43.911]  You know what?
[01:25:43.911 --> 01:25:45.312]  Get a liberal friend some BrainForce.
[01:25:45.312 --> 01:25:46.213]  Tell them, hey, you know what?
[01:25:46.213 --> 01:25:48.414]  I've noticed you've kind of been struggling with your brain.
[01:25:48.414 --> 01:25:50.035]  There's not much force behind it.
[01:25:50.035 --> 01:25:51.476]  Here's some BrainForce for you.

[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:34.920]  That's right.
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:38.283]  I brought an article with me today because it is a big weekend.
[01:26:38.283 --> 01:26:42.265]  Everybody likes to go have fun, drink in excess, and eat in excess.
[01:26:42.265 --> 01:26:45.267]  Because that's what we can do in America because we're free here.
[01:26:45.267 --> 01:26:46.388]  That's what happens.
[01:26:46.388 --> 01:26:48.049]  We have a free sovereign country.
[01:26:48.049 --> 01:26:49.850]  Yeah, then you end up with all kinds of health problems.
[01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:55.594]  But hey, if you just, you know, 90% of the time if you do good, if you live by the 90-10 rule or the 80-20 rule,
[01:26:57.535 --> 01:27:05.520]  You know, hey, it's okay to splurge every now and then, it's not bad, but just make sure your gut's clean, you clean yourself out after Memorial Day weekend.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:15.327]  There is a recall, actually, so just to let everybody know, the hot dog recall that's scaring families now, the Ohio-based maker of Nathan's and Curtis hot dogs,
[01:27:16.147 --> 01:27:28.263]  Has issued a recall for more than 210,000 pounds of ready-to-eat beef franks after receiving complaints about metal materials in their product.
[01:27:28.263 --> 01:27:29.465]  Oh, wait a second!
[01:27:29.465 --> 01:27:31.567]  We just came out with the Z-Shield!
[01:27:32.148 --> 01:27:32.769]  That's right!
[01:27:32.769 --> 01:27:34.450]  The Heavy Metal Detoxifier!
[01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:49.785]  So we've got, and of course the Living Defense, I take the Living Defense, the Biome Defense, these are all products that can help you cleanse your gut of bad bacteria, and then the new product, the Heavy Metal Detoxifier with the Z-Shield 2, those are new products, and then of course the Memorial Day Special going on
[01:27:50.345 --> 01:27:50.846]  Right now.
[01:27:50.846 --> 01:27:54.450]  Real quick before we get to this break, I want to play this video of Linda Sarsour.
[01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:58.776]  By my measurements, is a domestic agent of Hamas.
[01:27:58.776 --> 01:28:00.137]  That's my opinion.
[01:28:00.137 --> 01:28:04.142]  But now, her FGM tweets are receiving some backlash.
[01:28:04.142 --> 01:28:05.084]  Here's that video.
[01:28:07.316 --> 01:28:08.076]  Hi.
[01:28:08.076 --> 01:28:13.838]  So, um, this question is really important to me because I believe that women's rights are human rights.
[01:28:13.838 --> 01:28:20.060]  So I really want to know under what circumstances it's acceptable to say that I wish I could take their vaginas away.
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.621]  They don't deserve to be women.
[01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:31.344]  And just to give that context, that's one of your tweets off your Twitter.
[01:28:31.344 --> 01:28:36.386]  So Saur gets asked a question about her female genital mutilation tweets.
[01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:40.781]  This is an event organized by an Asian American, right?
[01:28:40.781 --> 01:28:44.404]  Let's just get some, let's get some context to this, what's going on here.
[01:28:44.404 --> 01:28:45.945]  Celebrating a community, right?
[01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:51.749]  Talking about communities of color who are being directly impacted at this moment.
[01:28:51.749 --> 01:28:55.813]  And I have a young white man in the back, who is not... And there it is, blame the white man.
[01:28:55.813 --> 01:28:58.595]  He's not affected.
[01:28:58.595 --> 01:28:59.896]  He doesn't get to have an opinion.
[01:29:01.389 --> 01:29:03.892]  Linda Sarsour, you go ahead and cut that trash off.
[01:29:03.892 --> 01:29:22.851]  Linda Sarsour comes here, promotes Sharia law, promotes female genital mutilation, and then, because an American citizen just asked her a question about her very, very, I don't even know, inappropriate, I mean ridiculous tweets about FGM, and she discounts him because he's a white male.
[01:29:22.851 --> 01:29:23.872]  How dare he speak?
[01:29:24.994 --> 01:29:27.215]  How dare a white male have an opinion?
[01:29:27.215 --> 01:29:27.975]  How dare?
[01:29:27.975 --> 01:29:29.196]  How dare that ever happen?
[01:29:29.196 --> 01:29:30.796]  I mean, this is what we're coming to.
[01:29:30.796 --> 01:29:32.037]  How dare you?
[01:29:32.037 --> 01:29:36.919]  How dare Dr. Ed Group make products for Infowarsstore.com that help your health?
[01:29:36.919 --> 01:29:43.981]  It doesn't matter if you're white, black, Asian, from the Middle East, they help your health no matter what, but he's a white male, so it doesn't matter!
[01:29:43.981 --> 01:29:48.023]  Thanks Linda Sarsour, why don't you go back to Hamas where you came from?
[01:29:48.023 --> 01:29:50.264]  Excuse me, we'll be right back.
[01:29:50.851 --> 01:29:53.379]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.379 --> 01:29:56.087]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:11.026]  Fox News has a new television host, and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories about Seth Rich.
[01:30:11.026 --> 01:30:17.930]  Let the Rich family get the closure that they need properly, and not with your crazy conspiracy theories on the internet.
[01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:19.110]  Save them for Bigfoot.
[01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:28.936]  In the post-Roger Ailes era of the Fox News Network, Liberal Democrat host Julie Roginsky went after Seth Rich conspiracy theorists.
[01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:32.037]  Listen, WikiLeaks was in collaboration with the Russians.
[01:30:32.037 --> 01:30:32.677]  How do we know this?
[01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:37.619]  Because the entire intelligence community said that the Russians were the ones that hacked into these emails.
[01:30:37.619 --> 01:30:46.683]  Meanwhile, evidence continues to surface that Seth Rich did, in fact, have contact with WikiLeaks before he was murdered.
[01:30:46.683 --> 01:30:54.766]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clinton crime family.
[01:30:54.766 --> 01:30:58.648]  I'm Darren McBreen, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.

[01:31:09.358 --> 01:31:17.465]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:17.765 --> 01:31:22.631]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:31:36.587 --> 01:31:38.508]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[01:31:38.508 --> 01:31:43.611]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[01:32:00.342 --> 01:32:06.844]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:32:06.844 --> 01:32:19.607]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:32:19.827 --> 01:32:23.491]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:32:23.491 --> 01:32:30.477]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:32:30.477 --> 01:32:43.349]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:32:43.349 --> 01:32:44.891]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:32:45.171 --> 01:32:51.554]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that Iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:33:08.411 --> 01:33:15.464]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.464 --> 01:33:18.570]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:27.498 --> 01:33:34.405]  Well, Dr. Group, we've talked about some health news, we've talked about the great products, the great Memorial Day special.
[01:33:34.405 --> 01:33:35.586]  Let's get into some other news now.
[01:33:35.586 --> 01:33:39.430]  Real quick, I just want to go back for a second on the Seth Rich thing, because I'd like to hear your opinion.
[01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:46.857]  Now, the biggest thing to me, where we stand right now, is that
[01:33:47.847 --> 01:33:53.370]  The fact that it's being dubbed fake news or a conspiracy theory about Seth Rich is just absurd.
[01:33:53.370 --> 01:33:58.872]  You have John Podesta in his own email saying, whether it's a leaker or not, we'll make an example of him.
[01:33:58.872 --> 01:34:02.334]  You have Kim.com saying he knows that it was Seth Rich.
[01:34:02.334 --> 01:34:05.956]  You have WikiLeaks offering a reward for any information on Seth Rich.
[01:34:05.956 --> 01:34:08.477]  You have an acclaimed robbery, yet nothing was robbed.
[01:34:08.477 --> 01:34:09.198]  You have the D.C.
[01:34:09.198 --> 01:34:11.499]  Police, which seem to be standing down in this investigation.
[01:34:11.499 --> 01:34:13.280]  You have Heather Podesta, who's involved with the D.C.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:13.800]  Police Board,
[01:34:17.241 --> 01:34:27.244]  But with all of that, they still want to say it was Russia that was meddling, but more importantly, Russia that leaked the DNC emails to WikiLeaks.
[01:34:27.244 --> 01:34:31.725]  So I'm just curious, where do you think the evidence stands right now?
[01:34:31.725 --> 01:34:39.327]  If you were a judge and you had to say, based on the evidence that we've been presented, who do you think gave the emails to WikiLeaks?
[01:34:39.327 --> 01:34:41.668]  Seth Rich, or the Russians, or perhaps neither?
[01:34:43.075 --> 01:34:48.080]  No, I think there's just a huge cover-up of what's currently going on in Washington right now.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:35:01.772]  When you look at the Podesta, the WikiLeaks, the collusion with the Russian story, I mean, all of the mainstream media is trying to cover up what I think they don't want people to find out.
[01:35:01.772 --> 01:35:04.594]  And that's how deep the collusion between
[01:35:05.715 --> 01:35:12.200]  The governmental swamp has been for years and years and years and how many people are actually involved.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:26.790]  I mean, you have evidence of the Clinton family and all of the people that have been linked to the Clinton family, including Seth Rich, that have been killed mysteriously or suicides.
[01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:28.491]  Yeah, there's just like 40 people.
[01:35:28.491 --> 01:35:29.252]  It's just a coincidence.
[01:35:29.412 --> 01:35:51.763]  Over the years and you know what I'm hoping is that eventually all of this stuff will be out in the open and one of the good things that we do have free speech and that we do have independent journalists which are being labeled as fake news but aren't really the fake news they're the real news and that's why people are just getting sick and tired of watching MSNBC and CNN and everything just because it's
[01:35:52.483 --> 01:35:56.666]  They don't report on the real issues that people want to hear about.
[01:35:56.666 --> 01:36:00.108]  See, and that's another weird thing that's going on right now, Dr. Group.
[01:36:00.108 --> 01:36:03.491]  When I go out on the streets and I talk to the Trump haters, okay?
[01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:08.054]  Even the Trump haters, even the people that are never Trumpers, they know CNN is fake news.
[01:36:08.054 --> 01:36:09.715]  They know MSNBC is fake news.
[01:36:09.715 --> 01:36:15.699]  They hate the fake news as much as anybody, yet they still buy all of the nonsense that they're selling.
[01:36:15.699 --> 01:36:19.541]  I tell you what, I mean, if you just look at the Obama administration,
[01:36:20.802 --> 01:36:30.487]  And, you know, you look at the Trump administration, every single word is changed into this conspiracy that, you know, Trump said this and this.
[01:36:30.487 --> 01:36:41.493]  Can you imagine if the mainstream media, even one hundredth of the stuff that happened under the Obama administration with the birth certificate and this and that and all of the
[01:36:42.573 --> 01:36:49.416]  Uh, support of, you know, the Muslim terrorists and brotherhoods and all of the information.
[01:36:49.416 --> 01:36:51.777]  I mean, if... Yeah, I was just talking to you.
[01:36:51.777 --> 01:36:56.699]  We just got a report today, uh, from Circa, from Sarah Carter.
[01:36:56.699 --> 01:36:59.960]  The Obama administration was spying illegally for eight years.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:10.350]  Yeah, I mean, they can do whatever they want and no one even, you know, bats a finger at it, yet we get into a new administration and they're just running scared is my opinion.
[01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:18.219]  I mean, I have insiders and I talk to people as well because pretty much everybody, regardless of who they are, has health problems and a lot of them come to me and
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.602]  You know, what I'm hearing is just that it is so big.
[01:37:23.602 --> 01:37:25.003]  The swamp is so big.
[01:37:25.003 --> 01:37:31.847]  There's so many people involved that, you know, so many people would go down if the truth comes out.
[01:37:31.847 --> 01:37:40.352]  So that's why there's such a suppression of truth, just like a suppression of all of the cures that we've had, you know, all the suppression of all of the
[01:37:41.513 --> 01:37:51.911]  Chemicals that are sprayed on us, a suppression of all of those things because they don't want the general population to find out what's really going on and thank God for InfoWars and thank God for all of the...
[01:37:52.793 --> 01:38:03.137]  You know, info warriors that are out there that are making a difference every single day and actually changing the world because it's the we, the people that are making a difference out there.
[01:38:03.137 --> 01:38:10.961]  So it's really upsetting that you have a murder slash suicide with Seth Rich out there.
[01:38:12.041 --> 01:38:15.224]  And it's getting no attention.
[01:38:15.224 --> 01:38:22.790]  There's, you know, obviously there's collusion and interactions between the DNC and different types of parties involved there.
[01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:34.339]  And I just hope that, I mean, I know Hannity is not going to be covering the Seth Rich story anymore because the family doesn't want him covering that, but I just hope that the truth comes out and
[01:38:35.464 --> 01:38:40.188]  I think that the truth is coming out and people are starting to look in different places for the truth.
[01:38:40.188 --> 01:38:47.053]  I mean, it's also sickening to see Google and Facebook and all the censorship that's going on right now.
[01:38:47.053 --> 01:38:54.079]  You know, six months ago, a year ago, you could type in Seth Rich in Google and you would actually be able to get on the first page
[01:38:54.959 --> 01:38:57.000]  A non-biased results.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.622]  I mean, sure, you could make your own conclusion.
[01:38:59.622 --> 01:39:04.845]  Is this fake news or is this, you know, real reporting or independent journalism going on?
[01:39:04.845 --> 01:39:16.092]  And now it's just nothing but the mainstream, you know, what Google wants you to see and what Google wants you to read for the first three pages because they know
[01:39:16.832 --> 01:39:19.333]  That no one is going to go past the third page for news.
[01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:21.595]  And we've exhibited that in real time.
[01:39:21.595 --> 01:39:25.997]  And I can just say from my use of the internet, you know, I'm a news reporter, I'm always looking for stories, I'm always doing this.
[01:39:25.997 --> 01:39:32.481]  I can just tell you from my experience how I've seen the difference in the changing of the priority of what gets ahead too.
[01:39:33.161 --> 01:39:34.982]  And you can do the test for yourself.
[01:39:34.982 --> 01:39:36.482]  You can go to Bing.
[01:39:36.482 --> 01:39:41.824]  Actually, a new website that I actually use instead of Google now when I'm doing research is DuckDuckGo.
[01:39:41.824 --> 01:39:43.864]  DuckDuckGo is a great search engine.
[01:39:43.864 --> 01:39:44.984]  There's some aspects of it.
[01:39:44.984 --> 01:39:51.406]  I think they're still behind Google, but they definitely don't filter their results, which is huge when you're trying to do some of this research.
[01:39:51.406 --> 01:39:56.828]  But, you know, I think that you just hit the nail on the head, and we're all thinking it, but you kind of just crystallized it.
[01:39:57.864 --> 01:40:01.265]  The real collusion is the swamp.
[01:40:01.265 --> 01:40:02.546]  That's the real collusion.
[01:40:02.546 --> 01:40:08.407]  It's all the corruption that's been going on for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years, how long these people have been in office.
[01:40:08.407 --> 01:40:19.191]  That's the real collusion, is covering that up, hiding that, not letting the public get that intel to know that that's the swamp, that's the collusion, that's who's been screwing this country over.
[01:40:19.191 --> 01:40:22.632]  Not Donald Trump who just decided to run for office two years ago.
[01:40:23.032 --> 01:40:25.575]  Not the deplorables that elected him, the deep state.
[01:40:25.575 --> 01:40:26.836]  That's the collusion.
[01:40:26.836 --> 01:40:32.702]  And it's a Saul Alinsky technique to blame your opposition for the thing that you're doing.
[01:40:32.702 --> 01:40:37.067]  So they're the ones colluding, so then they blame Russia for colluding with Trump.
[01:40:37.067 --> 01:40:38.909]  They blame Trump for colluding with Russia.
[01:40:38.909 --> 01:40:40.190]  Obviously fake news.
[01:40:40.190 --> 01:40:45.696]  And here's why I think the truth about Seth Rich is so near and dear to me and so important.
[01:40:47.170 --> 01:41:09.658]  If we can get the truth about Seth Rich out there in triplicate, cold, undeniable, provable facts, where even the dumbest of the dumb liberals who would deny their own hand in front of their face would have to accept that Seth Rich was the leaker to WikiLeaks, maybe we never know what happened to him.
[01:41:09.658 --> 01:41:12.739]  Maybe we never know what happened with the murder, okay?
[01:41:13.459 --> 01:41:19.786]  But if we get the cold hard evidence and we know for a fact that it was Seth Rich, indeed, who gave the DNC emails to WikiLeaks...
[01:41:20.888 --> 01:41:23.369]  That will change everything.
[01:41:23.369 --> 01:41:24.790]  That changes everything.
[01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:30.352]  It exposes everyone in government who's been crying Russian collusion for the last two years as a total fraud.
[01:41:30.352 --> 01:41:36.614]  It exposes everyone in the media who's been crying the Russian collusion narrative for two years as a total fraud.
[01:41:36.614 --> 01:41:38.095]  We know the frauds.
[01:41:38.095 --> 01:41:39.555]  We know who they are.
[01:41:39.555 --> 01:41:41.496]  This can be the skeleton key.
[01:41:41.496 --> 01:41:43.177]  This can be the Pandora's box.
[01:41:43.717 --> 01:41:48.040]  That will end the real fake news, end the real collusion.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:59.409]  That's why I want to get the truth about Seth Rich, because I truly believe that even the liberals, because Seth Rich was a Democrat for Bernie Sanders, even the liberals will have to say, okay, you know what?
[01:42:00.211 --> 01:42:01.872]  It was Seth Rich.
[01:42:01.872 --> 01:42:05.975]  I cannot believe that the government and the media lied about Russia.
[01:42:05.975 --> 01:42:07.916]  I guess that's the question.
[01:42:07.916 --> 01:42:22.425]  Just like can they accept, which they couldn't, accept the realities of Obama or Hillary Clinton, can they accept the reality that it was an inside source that leaked the DNC emails and that's what caused Hillary the election, not Russia?
[01:42:22.425 --> 01:42:26.368]  Can they get over that brainwashing, that mind control Russia narrative,
[01:42:27.168 --> 01:42:28.589]  If we get the truth about it out there.
[01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:30.189]  I guess that's the next question, Dr. Group.
[01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:33.731]  Think about how much money is being spent by the American taxpayers.
[01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:35.071]  Millions.
[01:42:35.071 --> 01:42:44.035]  Okay, how long does it take to figure out if there was a conversation between Donald Trump and the Russians that was detrimental to national security?
[01:42:44.035 --> 01:42:46.516]  Which doesn't even address the issue!
[01:42:46.516 --> 01:42:48.637]  It has nothing to do with Wikileaks!
[01:42:48.877 --> 01:42:55.301]  Yeah, they just keep making stuff up and making stuff up, but again, once again, it all goes back to the root cause.
[01:42:55.301 --> 01:43:09.208]  If you look at Washington over the last hundred years, and you look at lobbyists, and you look at the pharmaceutical industry, and you look at the oil and gas industry, and you see that the FDA is run by Monsanto and pharmaceutical, past pharmaceutical leaders.
[01:43:09.208 --> 01:43:15.712]  There's a great Venn diagram, if you guys can pull that up, the Venn diagram with the FDA and Monsanto, showing all the people that work for both of them.
[01:43:15.712 --> 01:43:17.213]  I think Mike Taylor was the main guy.
[01:43:17.213 --> 01:43:17.453]  Go ahead.
[01:43:17.833 --> 01:43:23.578]  I mean, all it is is about, you know, you talk about the swamp and you talk about the deep state and it really is... Talk about collusion.
[01:43:23.578 --> 01:43:25.279]  Yeah, talk about collusion.
[01:43:25.279 --> 01:43:29.443]  I mean, the deep state... But nothing from the Democrats on that collusion, though.
[01:43:29.443 --> 01:43:40.692]  If you want to go deep state, you know, look at the club, do your research on the Club of Rome, MKUltra programs, all the top secret governmental operations that have been going on, even dating back to putting fluoride in the water.
[01:43:40.692 --> 01:43:43.855]  I mean, it's all, the thing is, they, the Illuminatis,
[01:43:44.515 --> 01:43:51.277]  And the people that are running the world and trying to control the population, it's all out in the open.
[01:43:51.277 --> 01:43:55.999]  What we talk about here is not something that we're just making up out of thin air and saying all this is happening.
[01:43:55.999 --> 01:43:57.079]  And it's so obvious now too, you know?
[01:43:57.079 --> 01:44:00.721]  But that's part of the whole plan, because they have to make it obvious.
[01:44:00.721 --> 01:44:01.501]  It's like gaslighting you.
[01:44:01.801 --> 01:44:18.428]  It's Hollywood and they have to show you years in advance that this is going to take place and then this is going to take place and it's controlling your mind with all these suicide bombings and making you believe that, you know, in fear with terrorist attacks and then trying to manipulate you through the media.
[01:44:19.128 --> 01:44:29.015]  Really is the main source and that's another reason I think they're running scared right now is because they're realizing for the first time that the media is actually losing control.
[01:44:29.015 --> 01:44:32.958]  The people are taking information under their own discernment right now.
[01:44:34.319 --> 01:44:36.201]  People are waking up.
[01:44:36.201 --> 01:44:40.525]  Here's the thing too, Dr. Group, and this is something that's obviously developed with all the new technologies.
[01:44:40.525 --> 01:44:41.946]  It has to do with the chemicals.
[01:44:41.946 --> 01:44:44.308]  In fact, there was a new study that just came out.
[01:44:44.308 --> 01:44:48.712]  They just released this study that vaccines lead to an increase in ADHD.
[01:44:48.712 --> 01:44:50.874]  Okay, that's a big problem in our society.
[01:44:50.874 --> 01:44:56.038]  So you've got this new cycle now where people can't really operate outside of a 24-hour news cycle.
[01:44:56.038 --> 01:44:58.080]  They can't think about the bigger picture.
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:58.741]  Think about it like this.
[01:44:59.741 --> 01:45:04.102]  Just look at the last 20 years and under 20 years, how the narrative has changed.
[01:45:04.102 --> 01:45:06.263]  This is the gaslighting that I think you're talking about.
[01:45:06.263 --> 01:45:09.323]  So September 11th happens and it's like, boom!
[01:45:09.323 --> 01:45:11.784]  Radical Islamists just attacked your country.
[01:45:11.784 --> 01:45:12.164]  Boom!
[01:45:12.164 --> 01:45:13.144]  We're going to war.
[01:45:13.144 --> 01:45:14.345]  We're going to lie all about it.
[01:45:14.345 --> 01:45:15.245]  But don't worry.
[01:45:15.245 --> 01:45:17.185]  Radical Islam attacked your country.
[01:45:17.185 --> 01:45:19.266]  Radical Islam killed thousands of Americans.
[01:45:19.266 --> 01:45:20.586]  So we're going to invade the Middle East.
[01:45:20.586 --> 01:45:21.666]  We're going to fight terror.
[01:45:21.666 --> 01:45:22.647]  But now what's the case?
[01:45:22.647 --> 01:45:23.407]  15 to 20 years later,
[01:45:24.912 --> 01:45:25.793]  Be tolerant.
[01:45:25.793 --> 01:45:27.294]  There's no such thing as radical Islam.
[01:45:27.294 --> 01:45:27.935]  This doesn't exist.
[01:45:27.935 --> 01:45:30.437]  Wait, did you ever hear of Al-Qaeda before 9-11?
[01:45:32.176 --> 01:45:33.236]  Me personally?
[01:45:33.236 --> 01:45:33.636]  No.
[01:45:33.636 --> 01:45:34.637]  Did you know about it?
[01:45:34.637 --> 01:45:36.417]  No, no, no, I didn't know about anything.
[01:45:36.417 --> 01:45:38.378]  Was he a baseball player for the Braves or something?
[01:45:38.378 --> 01:45:39.558]  That's what I heard as, but no.
[01:45:39.558 --> 01:45:48.941]  No, it's just like all of a sudden we hear about Al-Qaeda right after a terrorist attack and then all of a sudden Al-Qaeda's gone and then all of a sudden there's a new one, ISIS, which we never heard about ISIS during 9-11 either.
[01:45:48.941 --> 01:45:56.743]  And they don't even report on the fact, see that's the thing, they won't even report how years before, you know, Al-Qaeda was created by the U.S.
[01:45:56.743 --> 01:45:57.143]  government
[01:45:57.623 --> 01:46:01.865]  To force regime changes in areas of Russia and the Middle East.
[01:46:01.865 --> 01:46:03.186]  They don't ever talk about that.
[01:46:03.186 --> 01:46:12.530]  Because if you look at what's taught to our children in school these days, it's just bogus, mind-manipulating subjects.
[01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:17.553]  That's why our kids these days have hard communication skills.
[01:46:17.553 --> 01:46:22.215]  Because of all the technology and everything, they're not learning the right things that they need to learn in schools.
[01:46:22.215 --> 01:46:25.437]  It's all done on purpose to try to control even
[01:46:26.337 --> 01:46:33.499]  You know, I was doing research and looking at, dating back, how are they, how is this whole process taking place?
[01:46:33.499 --> 01:46:34.840]  Look at your home.
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:38.701]  Like, everything in your house is designed to make you sick.
[01:46:38.701 --> 01:46:41.082]  Take your kitchen, for example.
[01:46:41.082 --> 01:46:44.003]  Okay, you might have radon being emitted in your kitchen.
[01:46:44.003 --> 01:46:47.384]  You have tap water that you're cooking with coming out of your kitchen sink.
[01:46:47.384 --> 01:46:49.885]  And fluoride concentrates when it's heated up.
[01:46:50.225 --> 01:46:53.188]  Yeah, you have all the fluoride and all that that you're cooking your food with.
[01:46:53.188 --> 01:46:54.869]  Oh, the introduction of microwaves.
[01:46:54.869 --> 01:46:55.790]  This is just the kitchen.
[01:46:55.790 --> 01:47:06.239]  We can go room by room and I can explain to you how, by design, the rooms in your house... You were fired up because you had a list of all the things that are in your kitchen that are poisoning you.
[01:47:06.579 --> 01:47:16.803]  Yeah, and we'll cover that in the next hour because I really think it's important, but it also goes back to the whole point that we're trying to make with the deep state and how deep it actually goes.
[01:47:16.803 --> 01:47:18.324]  Okay, so let's get back to that for a second.
[01:47:18.324 --> 01:47:19.684]  Okay, so we've got this video.
[01:47:19.684 --> 01:47:25.547]  This is Brennan, who I don't trust Brennan as far as I could throw him, but even Brennan, this is Brennan saying,
[01:47:26.047 --> 01:47:35.822]  Now again, this whole narrative is kind of different, but this is Brennan talking about the allegation that Donald Trump tried to shut down the Russia probe via firing James Comey.
[01:47:35.822 --> 01:47:36.563]  Here's John Brennan.
[01:47:37.483 --> 01:47:37.563]  Uh,
[01:48:07.583 --> 01:48:09.466]  No, sir.
[01:48:09.466 --> 01:48:22.024]  Are you aware of any efforts the president has made to enlist the support of intelligence community personnel to push back on a narrative involving the collusion issue that Mr. Rooney was asking about?
[01:48:22.024 --> 01:48:22.805]  I am unaware of it.
[01:48:23.826 --> 01:48:34.310]  I said earlier that President Trump is handcuffed right now because I'm telling you, like you were saying, all of the money and time that's being wasted on this Russia thing, I guarantee you Trump is pulling his hair out over this.
[01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:35.231]  He's a businessman.
[01:48:35.231 --> 01:48:36.351]  He's about the bottom line.
[01:48:36.351 --> 01:48:37.211]  This is a waste.
[01:48:37.211 --> 01:48:38.732]  This is putting us into the red.
[01:48:38.732 --> 01:48:43.234]  But he's handcuffed because if he comes out and he says that, if he comes out and he says we need to stop it,
[01:48:43.914 --> 01:48:44.915]  Then he's colluding!
[01:48:44.915 --> 01:48:46.638]  Then he must be working with Russia!
[01:48:46.638 --> 01:48:58.312]  Even though, when it was alleged that he tried to do that, to shut down the investigation, Comey may have perjured himself in this case, or he lied, well either he perjured himself and lied, or he just lied.
[01:48:59.193 --> 01:48:59.574]  But even
[01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:22.297]  His job as a CEO, as a business leader, is to create change and make that business great again.
[01:49:22.297 --> 01:49:25.679]  And right now the business is making America great again.
[01:49:25.679 --> 01:49:29.302]  We're 20 trillion or more than that in debt right now.
[01:49:29.302 --> 01:49:35.127]  That's happened over the last, and I'm not saying it was just the Obama administration, it dates back before there, the Bush administration too.
[01:49:36.628 --> 01:49:53.722]  His job is to make sure that we look at all the spending that we have, where we're wasting money, because Washington has been nothing but flushing money down the toilet for years and years and years and overspending on everything, most of the stuff they overspend on.
[01:49:54.403 --> 01:49:57.125]  Doesn't do us any good as a society.
[01:49:57.125 --> 01:50:04.671]  But it's all about what you were talking about, the deep, deep state, and the collusion between... It took a hundred years!
[01:50:04.671 --> 01:50:18.261]  Okay, when the AMA was developed, the American Medical Association, you look back a hundred years to the oil and gas industry, it took a hundred years, Republican and Democrat, with the deep state being run by Illuminati-type forces.
[01:50:19.264 --> 01:50:30.692]  To get all of that in with the chemical approvals, with all of the stuff that's killing not only us, but killing the planet as well at the same time.
[01:50:30.692 --> 01:50:32.533]  And they're saying, oh, it's climate change.
[01:50:32.533 --> 01:50:41.019]  But when you look at the amount of chemicals that we're putting in the air that are approved by the EPA and all the other stuff, then you start saying, well, no, it's not really climate change.
[01:50:41.019 --> 01:50:44.101]  But the thing is... Or it is man-made climate change.
[01:50:44.101 --> 01:50:48.824]  They're seeing a hundred years worth of work start to slowly crumble.
[01:50:49.624 --> 01:50:51.466]  Because they don't have one of their own in office.
[01:50:51.466 --> 01:50:52.147]  We're beating it.
[01:50:52.147 --> 01:50:54.529]  And again, whether you like Trump or not, he's not with them.
[01:50:54.529 --> 01:50:57.312]  And we've got more on Trump cutting the deficit on the other side.
[01:50:57.312 --> 01:50:57.952]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:50:57.952 --> 01:50:59.714]  Owen Schroer, Ed Group, this is the Alex Jones Show.

[01:54:15.412 --> 01:54:18.815]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:54:18.815 --> 01:54:20.176]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:20.176 --> 01:54:21.997]  Owen Troyer, Dr. Ed Group with you.
[01:54:21.997 --> 01:54:24.418]  We are covering the waterfront of news.
[01:54:24.418 --> 01:54:30.162]  And we were just about to talk about Trump's budget, the deficit in this country that's spiraling out of control.
[01:54:30.162 --> 01:54:31.863]  Trump is actually doing something about it.
[01:54:31.863 --> 01:54:32.304]  Wow!
[01:54:32.304 --> 01:54:33.825]  I didn't even know that was possible.
[01:54:33.825 --> 01:54:36.026]  But we're going to take your calls in the next hour.
[01:54:36.026 --> 01:54:36.086]  1-800-259-9231
[01:54:40.429 --> 01:54:40.509]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:40.509 --> 01:54:48.377]  We'll take your calls, myself and Dr. Group, in the next hour.
[01:54:48.377 --> 01:54:49.338]  So I've got some news here.
[01:54:49.338 --> 01:54:50.459]  We were just talking about the debt.
[01:54:51.621 --> 01:54:56.264]  It was almost reaching a point, Dr. Group, where I didn't think anything could even be done with the debt.
[01:54:56.264 --> 01:54:58.745]  It's just like a ticking clock that just goes up and up.
[01:54:58.745 --> 01:55:04.289]  But Trump is actually cutting the budget right now, which is a start.
[01:55:04.289 --> 01:55:04.909]  It's a start.
[01:55:04.909 --> 01:55:06.550]  It's not a be-all, end-all.
[01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:08.871]  But a couple stories from The Daily Caller here.
[01:55:08.871 --> 01:55:13.594]  Trump proposes $3.6 trillion cut to welfare state.
[01:55:13.594 --> 01:55:16.376]  Thank you!
[01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:17.156]  This is how you...
[01:55:19.807 --> 01:55:30.794]  You know, if I'm in debt, if I'm broke, okay, and I drive by a homeless guy on the side of the road, but I don't have any money to give him, I don't have any money to give him!
[01:55:30.794 --> 01:55:32.335]  I can't help him!
[01:55:32.335 --> 01:55:32.915]  Okay?
[01:55:32.915 --> 01:55:35.216]  We've got a government that is broke!
[01:55:35.216 --> 01:55:39.339]  Why are we paying non-citizens to come here and live?
[01:55:39.339 --> 01:55:41.700]  Let alone anybody that's a citizen here.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:43.701]  How about all the non-citizens?
[01:55:43.701 --> 01:55:45.623]  So, Trump, $3.6 trillion cut
[01:55:48.325 --> 01:55:53.746]  To the welfare state, that is huge.
[01:55:53.746 --> 01:56:01.427]  And I'm imagining, here's another one, Trump budget aims to eliminate tax credits for illegal immigrants.
[01:56:01.427 --> 01:56:02.108]  Wow!
[01:56:02.108 --> 01:56:04.588]  America first policies.
[01:56:04.588 --> 01:56:14.190]  President Donald Trump's budget proposal for 2018 prevents illegal immigrants from claiming two major tax credits for low and middle income people, according to the White House documents released
[01:56:15.617 --> 01:56:26.364]  Tuesday morning, the $4.1 trillion budget cut would restrict eligibility for the IETC and the Child Tax Credit to taxpayers who are authorized to work in the U.S.
[01:56:26.364 --> 01:56:37.151]  So, no longer are non-citizens getting these tax cut benefits that they were before that Americans most likely aren't getting or aren't taking advantage of.
[01:56:38.092 --> 01:56:39.233]  There you go, Dr. Group.
[01:56:39.233 --> 01:56:42.816]  It seems like an impossible task to cut the budget.
[01:56:42.816 --> 01:56:45.738]  It seems like an impossible task for peace in the Middle East.
[01:56:45.738 --> 01:56:50.141]  But Trump does appear to be going after both right now.
[01:56:50.141 --> 01:56:51.062]  That all sounds good.
[01:56:51.062 --> 01:56:52.443]  I mean, it all sounds good.
[01:56:52.443 --> 01:56:54.284]  I'm all for helping people.
[01:56:54.284 --> 01:56:59.508]  But if you look at society, and we're always hiring people and trying to hire as many people as we can.
[01:56:59.508 --> 01:57:03.111]  I know InfoWars is as well.
[01:57:03.111 --> 01:57:07.314]  You know, it's really hard these days because
[01:57:09.275 --> 01:57:19.522]  There's such, you know, all of these problems that we've had over the last 20 years, you're starting to see it in the workforce.
[01:57:19.522 --> 01:57:23.925]  I'm like, listen, let's get people to work all the time.
[01:57:23.925 --> 01:57:31.071]  Let's help as many people as we can, but we also have to educate people the right way and we have to let them know and train them the right way.
[01:57:33.112 --> 01:57:39.066]  Goes back to the proper type of schooling and it all goes back to identifying the root cause of the problem.
[01:57:39.066 --> 01:57:42.394]  When you put somebody on welfare for a long period of time...
[01:57:43.399 --> 01:57:44.760]  Why would they want to work?
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.441]  They're not going to want to work anymore.
[01:57:46.441 --> 01:57:54.004]  I mean, it's the same with, we talk to these guys that are looking for jobs and they've been out of work six months, they've been out of work a year, they've been out of work two years.
[01:57:54.004 --> 01:57:59.967]  In today's society, almost if you're gone for six months, you're so far behind already.
[01:57:59.967 --> 01:58:10.633]  So what happens is we're paying these guys, you know, all this work compensation for so long, and why do they want to go back to work when we're paying them all this workers' compensation fees?
[01:58:10.633 --> 01:58:12.534]  And when they do want to go back to work,
[01:58:13.450 --> 01:58:17.873]  It's just creating more and more situations that we're having to deal with.
[01:58:17.873 --> 01:58:20.115]  But I'm glad we're taking this on and trying to deal with it.
[01:58:20.115 --> 01:58:23.378]  It creates a societal problem, and it also creates a debt problem.
[01:58:23.378 --> 01:58:25.559]  So it's a two-edged sword.
[01:58:25.559 --> 01:58:26.060]  Yes.
[01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:31.104]  And we're stabbing ourselves with it, but it looks like President Trump is finally starting to do something about it.
[01:58:31.104 --> 01:58:33.325]  We will start to take your calls on the other side.
[01:58:33.325 --> 01:58:35.467]  Owen Schroeder, Dr. Group, filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:58:35.467 --> 01:58:36.127]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:36.127 --> 01:58:43.153]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.801 --> 01:58:50.687]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.687 --> 01:59:05.022]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[01:59:05.022 --> 01:59:07.365]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[01:59:07.845 --> 01:59:11.807]  is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[01:59:11.807 --> 01:59:24.153]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[01:59:24.153 --> 01:59:28.995]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at Inforrestore.com.
[01:59:29.175 --> 01:59:30.856]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:25.952 --> 02:00:30.656]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:30.656 --> 02:00:33.758]  We've got your calls lined up.
[02:00:33.758 --> 02:00:35.760]  Owen Schroeder, Dr. Group with you.
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.583]  We've got a lot more news to cover as well.
[02:00:49.158 --> 02:00:52.384]  You know, we were talking outside of the break.
[02:00:52.384 --> 02:00:54.909]  It's talked about Trump's brinksmanship.
[02:00:54.909 --> 02:00:58.716]  It's talked about Trump playing 6-D chess.
[02:00:58.716 --> 02:01:00.940]  I do think that Trump is a lot smarter than
[02:01:03.251 --> 02:01:03.411]  I don't
[02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:33.344]  Let's recall that, and I remember talking to Alex about this when this came out, Joe Lieberman was allegedly being considered for the FBI director position.
[02:01:34.505 --> 02:01:39.226]  And Dr. Group, I remember saying on air, to me, this feels like perhaps a fake leak.
[02:01:39.226 --> 02:01:48.228]  This seems like maybe Trump leaks this out to a member of his cabinet, or this or that, and he sees where it goes, if it goes legs, and then he says, oh, here's a leaker, what do you know?
[02:01:48.228 --> 02:01:59.951]  And now it comes out today, Joe Lieberman no longer being considered, so I'm wondering if Joe Lieberman was ever really actually being considered for that role, or if that was just a Trump troll that he put out there.
[02:02:00.171 --> 02:02:00.731]  No, I agree.
[02:02:00.731 --> 02:02:09.518]  I think that there's definitely some chess games being played now, considering what's happened, obviously, that we've been watching since the Trump administration has started.
[02:02:09.518 --> 02:02:11.580]  I, you know, I'm an American.
[02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:13.881]  I was in the military.
[02:02:13.881 --> 02:02:17.544]  So, you know, my job was to always support the commander in chief.
[02:02:17.544 --> 02:02:18.345]  And I think that
[02:02:19.346 --> 02:02:25.188]  You know, you have the Chuck Schumer's out there, you have the Maxine Waters, you have the Nancy Pelosi's out there.
[02:02:25.188 --> 02:02:31.411]  I mean, talking about mental health, and you look at people in our government.
[02:02:31.411 --> 02:02:32.971]  In their case, a lack thereof.
[02:02:32.971 --> 02:02:34.752]  A lack thereof is what I was trying to get.
[02:02:34.752 --> 02:02:42.455]  I mean, Nancy Pelosi, she even has a hard time pronouncing China, and it's just, it's amazing to me when you see this and the attacks.
[02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:45.336]  How can people be so negative and so violent?
[02:02:45.336 --> 02:02:47.097]  I don't remember anybody on the
[02:02:47.737 --> 02:02:52.883]  Republican side coming out with so much violence and so much attack.
[02:02:52.883 --> 02:02:54.825]  But Dr. Group, you can speak to this.
[02:02:54.825 --> 02:03:03.654]  That is a side effect when elderly people start to go through stages of dementia or Alzheimer's or other, you know, mental defects like that.
[02:03:03.654 --> 02:03:05.156]  They start to get angry.
[02:03:05.156 --> 02:03:07.278]  That actually is an issue that they have.
[02:03:07.518 --> 02:03:25.805]  Right, I think everybody in government over the age of 60 should go through some sort of a mental evaluation and I'm not just saying that now, I'm just saying mental health is becoming one of the world's largest situations that we're having to deal with and one of the most expensive
[02:03:26.565 --> 02:03:27.766]  In health care.
[02:03:27.766 --> 02:03:35.111]  And just today, as a matter of fact, you know, speaking of health care, which has been very quiet, the health care reform.
[02:03:35.111 --> 02:03:43.758]  Today is the day the Senate can begin the health care discussions because they're going to finally get the official word from the Congressional Budget Office.
[02:03:43.758 --> 02:03:47.301]  So I have submitted multiple requests
[02:03:48.621 --> 02:04:05.187]  To the president, to the office, at addressing the root cause of our health care problems in America today, which is the toxic food, the toxic water, the toxic air, and all the chemicals that the government approves in the vaccines and everything.
[02:04:05.187 --> 02:04:09.128]  It sounds like a broken record all the time talking about all these toxins everywhere, but
[02:04:10.302 --> 02:04:25.754]  When you spent 20 years tracing to the root cause of all disease and knowing that the root cause of all disease is basically too many chemicals and toxins coming into your body and not enough coming out and we were talking about the home and how that was specifically designed.
[02:04:26.954 --> 02:04:30.437]  To make you sick when you live in a home or an apartment.
[02:04:30.437 --> 02:04:36.222]  And we were talking about the kitchen and thinking about how many chemicals and toxins are in your kitchen alone.
[02:04:36.222 --> 02:04:39.785]  You look at the two places that people spend the most time.
[02:04:39.785 --> 02:04:40.966]  The kitchen and the bedroom.
[02:04:40.966 --> 02:04:43.168]  And we'll come back right after this with your calls.
[02:04:43.168 --> 02:04:46.731]  We'll go over some tips and actually some victories that we have.
[02:04:46.731 --> 02:04:49.453]  I brought some really, really good news to cover today, Owen.
[02:04:49.453 --> 02:04:50.214]  That's Dr. Group.
[02:04:50.214 --> 02:04:51.655]  I'm Owen Troy filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:04:51.655 --> 02:04:53.377]  We'll be right back on the other side with your phone calls.
[02:05:01.781 --> 02:05:11.525]  Fox News has a new television host, and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories about Seth Rich.
[02:05:11.525 --> 02:05:18.408]  Let the Rich family get the closure that they need properly, and not with your crazy conspiracy theories on the internet.
[02:05:18.408 --> 02:05:19.608]  Save them for Bigfoot.
[02:05:19.608 --> 02:05:23.190]  In the post-Roger Ailes era of the Fox News Network,
[02:05:23.490 --> 02:05:29.557]  Liberal Democrat host Julie Roginsky went after Seth Rich, conspiracy theorist.
[02:05:29.557 --> 02:05:32.520]  Listen, WikiLeaks was in collaboration with the Russians.
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:33.161]  How do we know this?
[02:05:33.161 --> 02:05:38.067]  Because the entire intelligence community said that the Russians were the ones that hacked into these emails.
[02:05:38.387 --> 02:05:47.170]  Meanwhile, evidence continues to surface that Seth Rich did in fact have contact with WikiLeaks before he was murdered.
[02:05:47.170 --> 02:05:55.253]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clinton crime family.
[02:05:55.253 --> 02:05:59.295]  I'm Darren McBreen and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:01.175 --> 02:06:09.618]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:09.618 --> 02:06:12.779]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[02:06:12.779 --> 02:06:22.563]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[02:06:22.563 --> 02:06:23.403]  Caveman.
[02:06:23.403 --> 02:06:30.486]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that
[02:06:30.886 --> 02:06:34.047]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:34.047 --> 02:06:39.169]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:39.169 --> 02:06:47.192]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:47.192 --> 02:06:55.114]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:55.114 --> 02:06:59.916]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and 4WarsLife.com today.
[02:07:00.666 --> 02:07:02.526]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:07:02.526 --> 02:07:04.587]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:07:04.587 --> 02:07:07.488]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:07:07.488 --> 02:07:13.549]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:07:13.549 --> 02:07:22.732]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:07:22.732 --> 02:07:27.593]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:07:27.813 --> 02:07:30.274]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:07:30.274 --> 02:07:38.297]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:07:38.297 --> 02:07:39.378]  The general public doesn't.
[02:07:40.473 --> 02:07:43.857]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:07:43.857 --> 02:07:47.981]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:07:47.981 --> 02:07:54.708]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:07:54.708 --> 02:07:58.812]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:08:11.264 --> 02:08:13.846]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:13.846 --> 02:08:17.008]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.008 --> 02:08:28.555]  Well Dr. Group and I were talking during the break about how epic these times are and I mean we both recognize how epic they are and even we probably can't even fully comprehend how epic these times are the revolutions that are going on.
[02:08:29.608 --> 02:08:33.730]  Truly, it's just unbelievable what history will say about these times in 20, 30, 40 years.
[02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:35.611]  And people, again, they can't really comprehend that.
[02:08:35.611 --> 02:08:40.513]  They can't really grasp that because they live in a 24-hour news cycle, the here and the now.
[02:08:40.513 --> 02:08:41.954]  They don't understand history.
[02:08:41.954 --> 02:08:44.535]  And then Dr. Group talks about how
[02:08:44.775 --> 02:08:53.942]  We were talking about the singularity, merging with machines, and now they're about to bring out 5G technology, which you say is going to be very damaging to our DNA.
[02:08:53.942 --> 02:09:00.508]  Well, luckily, at Infowarsstore.com, we have a product that can help that with DNA force.
[02:09:00.508 --> 02:09:04.931]  Dr. Group, I think that this is one of the most unbelievable products that you've come out with.
[02:09:04.931 --> 02:09:09.094]  We don't need to make the claims about what the product does, but what you've noticed
[02:09:10.103 --> 02:09:15.687]  About DNA Force is this is a product that we proprietary came out with what about two years ago?
[02:09:15.687 --> 02:09:17.548]  I think it's been about two years.
[02:09:17.548 --> 02:09:21.190]  It's definitely the state-of-the-art product that we have here.
[02:09:21.190 --> 02:09:28.896]  It's amazing and I always go back and tell people to just read the reviews on the products and just know that we're only able
[02:09:29.761 --> 02:09:35.623]  To post probably about 60 to 70% of the actual reviews on all the products.
[02:09:35.623 --> 02:09:38.304]  There's some incredible products here.
[02:09:38.304 --> 02:09:40.444]  Memorial Day weekend is coming up.
[02:09:40.444 --> 02:09:42.845]  I don't remember so many products being on sale at once.
[02:09:42.845 --> 02:09:46.526]  Silver Bullet, the colloidal silvers is 65% off retail.
[02:09:46.526 --> 02:09:49.507]  The Super Male Vitality, I take that all the time.
[02:09:49.507 --> 02:09:51.668]  Anybody, I take DNA Force.
[02:09:51.668 --> 02:09:52.648]  I mean, I take it every day.
[02:09:53.288 --> 02:09:54.769]  I take DNA Force every day.
[02:09:54.769 --> 02:09:59.770]  It's really the telomeres are what decrease with aging.
[02:09:59.770 --> 02:10:01.991]  It's an amazing product.
[02:10:01.991 --> 02:10:03.591]  It gives me energy.
[02:10:03.591 --> 02:10:06.272]  It helps me feel young and vibrant.
[02:10:06.272 --> 02:10:07.272]  So does a super male.
[02:10:07.272 --> 02:10:08.533]  I mean, studies have shown that
[02:10:09.173 --> 02:10:14.576]  All males 28 years or older, their hormones start to decline.
[02:10:14.576 --> 02:10:19.999]  Your DHEA starts to decline, your growth hormone, your testosterone starts to decline.
[02:10:19.999 --> 02:10:29.645]  And so instead of running out to the hormone clinics out there and getting injections, you know, we try to find natural solutions to help you balance your body.
[02:10:30.665 --> 02:10:33.126]  Survival Shield, DX2, iodine.
[02:10:33.126 --> 02:10:34.807]  It's the cleanest source in the world.
[02:10:34.807 --> 02:10:40.769]  It took us years to develop the ways to stabilize the iodine molecule in the glycerin.
[02:10:40.769 --> 02:10:41.809]  I also take that.
[02:10:41.809 --> 02:10:46.471]  We now see reports coming out all the time that everybody's iodine deficient.
[02:10:46.471 --> 02:10:47.131]  It's true.
[02:10:47.131 --> 02:10:48.791]  There's so many thyroid conditions.
[02:10:48.791 --> 02:10:50.692]  Dr. Group, you're such a snake oil salesman.
[02:10:50.692 --> 02:10:56.574]  You know, you take your own products, you tell me that there's fluoride in the water damaging my brain, you make a product and then you take it to
[02:10:56.874 --> 02:10:58.115]  To help yourself and others.
[02:11:17.904 --> 02:11:19.865]  You came out with DNA Force years ago.
[02:11:19.865 --> 02:11:21.226]  Now there's new products.
[02:11:21.226 --> 02:11:25.009]  There's all these infomercials growing talking about telomeres, protecting the telomeres.
[02:11:25.009 --> 02:11:27.510]  It's called, well, I don't need to give them a product plug.
[02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:28.891]  We've got the product you want.
[02:11:28.891 --> 02:11:32.194]  DNA Force is the product you want at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:11:32.194 --> 02:11:33.434]  We have the groundbreaking products.
[02:11:33.434 --> 02:11:41.660]  And again, the sales, the Memorial Day mega special sales right now at InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsStore.com are just huge.
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:43.701]  Take advantage of these sales, folks.
[02:11:43.701 --> 02:11:47.164]  You know, it's the soldiers that provide our freedom for this country.
[02:11:48.104 --> 02:12:00.514]  So, we want to promote them on Memorial Day and we want to promote our products at a significant discount to just bring you on board, to show you that these products really are life-changing.
[02:12:00.514 --> 02:12:03.857]  And Dr. Group, he proprietizes a lot of these formulas.
[02:12:03.857 --> 02:12:04.798]  He takes them himself.
[02:12:04.798 --> 02:12:05.739]  I take them every day.
[02:12:05.739 --> 02:12:08.621]  So, it's not just us up here promoting these products.
[02:12:08.621 --> 02:12:10.343]  We actually take them as well.
[02:12:10.343 --> 02:12:12.965]  Take advantage of the Memorial Day specials.
[02:12:13.585 --> 02:12:18.267]  Alright, you know what Dr. Group, what do you say we start taking some phone calls now?
[02:12:18.267 --> 02:12:19.447]  Sounds good, sounds good.
[02:12:19.447 --> 02:12:22.388]  I've got a bunch of good information to share with people today.
[02:12:22.388 --> 02:12:28.990]  I know that everybody really loves to get good health information and health tips, so I'm ready to go with that.
[02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:31.291]  And you know what, just to add one more thing to the
[02:12:32.051 --> 02:12:33.292]  To the products that we have.
[02:12:33.292 --> 02:12:38.397]  I mean, it really supports everything that InfoWars does.
[02:12:38.397 --> 02:12:47.845]  All of the employees here that worked so hard to get you the real news, to get you the breaking news every single day.
[02:12:47.845 --> 02:12:50.467]  And if it wasn't for all the products, because listen,
[02:12:51.448 --> 02:12:57.070]  How many people, the big companies and corporations out there, they just want to advertise on the mainstream news.
[02:12:57.070 --> 02:13:03.792]  I mean, they don't want to be associated with this, so Alex has to fund this operation through other methods.
[02:13:03.792 --> 02:13:15.056]  So all the donations that people send in, all the support for the products, which you're going to take the products, you're going to feel great, you're going to have changes in your health, you're going to be smarter, the iodine is going to detoxify,
[02:13:15.976 --> 02:13:19.098]  Chlorine, the bromine, the fluoride that people are exposed to.
[02:13:19.098 --> 02:13:20.419]  Yeah, you don't need this technology.
[02:13:20.419 --> 02:13:21.960]  You don't need the nano cells.
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:28.564]  God gave us a body that can repair itself and be great with the actual natural organic elements of Earth.
[02:13:28.564 --> 02:13:41.373]  God gave us a self-healing mechanism and all we need to do is activate it and cleansing and detoxification and giving the body the clean food and the clean water and the proper supplements that have been taken away from us.
[02:13:42.213 --> 02:13:43.853]  In order for us to heal ourselves.
[02:13:43.853 --> 02:13:46.154]  And that's really how you change the health care system.
[02:13:46.154 --> 02:13:50.715]  I mean, that's what I've been trying to get across to these guys for 15 years.
[02:13:50.715 --> 02:13:52.835]  And insurance companies, they need to cover it.
[02:13:52.835 --> 02:14:00.917]  I'm hoping, I'm really hoping that the changes that they're going to make to the HSA and the health care plan are going to support more preventative medicine.
[02:14:00.917 --> 02:14:07.238]  Because if you can prevent people from getting sick, educate people on why they're getting sick,
[02:14:08.018 --> 02:14:15.140]  Then, they won't get sick and it won't be such a burden on all of us in the United States and in the health care system as a whole.
[02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:17.781]  The United States is ranked almost last in the world.
[02:14:17.781 --> 02:14:19.121]  But we spend the most money?
[02:14:19.121 --> 02:14:20.322]  And we spend the most money, yes.
[02:14:20.322 --> 02:14:21.522]  So let's get to some calls.
[02:14:21.522 --> 02:14:22.743]  Well, I just want to say this, too.
[02:14:22.743 --> 02:14:26.364]  Health insurance starts with self-consciousness.
[02:14:26.364 --> 02:14:29.705]  It should be upon yourself to take care of yourself, not the government.
[02:14:29.705 --> 02:14:31.185]  All right, with that, we'll go to some calls.
[02:14:31.185 --> 02:14:33.226]  Let's go to Eric in Wisconsin.
[02:14:33.826 --> 02:14:36.807]  Who says he wants to start a petition to audit the media.
[02:14:36.807 --> 02:14:38.328]  That is an interesting notion.
[02:14:38.328 --> 02:14:39.268]  Go ahead, Eric.
[02:14:39.268 --> 02:14:42.410]  How's it going, Owen?
[02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:44.511]  What's up, Dr. Group?
[02:14:44.511 --> 02:14:45.651]  Great job today, Owen.
[02:14:45.651 --> 02:14:49.113]  You're really destroying, as usual.
[02:14:49.113 --> 02:14:53.094]  Dr. Group, your products changed my life.
[02:14:53.094 --> 02:14:54.855]  Thank you so much for the work that you do.
[02:14:54.855 --> 02:14:56.996]  I just want to call today
[02:14:57.645 --> 02:15:04.366]  Because I found an article, it was actually written December 13, 2016 by Andrew Kerr.
[02:15:04.366 --> 02:15:06.547]  It's over on thecitizensaudits.com.
[02:15:06.547 --> 02:15:11.828]  Yeah, and that's the original one where he breaks down David Brock's PACs, correct?
[02:15:11.828 --> 02:15:12.368]  Correct?
[02:15:12.368 --> 02:15:13.628]  Yep.
[02:15:13.628 --> 02:15:16.609]  Yeah, I remember having him on to talk about that.
[02:15:16.609 --> 02:15:21.770]  Yeah, and for whatever reason, there's only 1,500
[02:15:23.345 --> 02:15:25.366]  People signed up on the petition right now.
[02:15:25.366 --> 02:15:28.588]  I just want to get all the info warriors on this petition.
[02:15:28.588 --> 02:15:34.491]  I mean, these guys are attacking everybody in the media, including you guys, and it's got to stop.
[02:15:34.491 --> 02:15:37.093]  This organization's got to be brought to task.
[02:15:37.093 --> 02:15:46.778]  Yeah, how is it that David Brock gets to have all of his super PACs in the same building, funneling money in between each other, taking a cut off of each exchange?
[02:15:46.778 --> 02:15:48.459]  I mean,
[02:15:49.446 --> 02:15:56.489]  If InfoWars was doing something like that, I mean, my goodness, we just want to sell you great products at a cheap price.
[02:15:56.489 --> 02:16:00.411]  So tell, okay, so that story came out in December, guys, see if you can pull that up from Andrew Kerr.
[02:16:00.411 --> 02:16:04.073]  What was the headline on that story, Eric?
[02:16:04.073 --> 02:16:08.215]  Headline is, David Brock's Media Matters has hidden $1,052,500 from the IRS since 2010.
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:19.625]  I mean, all those super PACs are, you know, I heard Hillary's starting her own new PAC now as well.
[02:16:19.625 --> 02:16:20.185]  What is it?
[02:16:20.185 --> 02:16:21.206]  Forward something?
[02:16:21.206 --> 02:16:22.507]  Or forward together?
[02:16:22.507 --> 02:16:23.388]  Resist!
[02:16:23.388 --> 02:16:24.329]  Persist!
[02:16:24.329 --> 02:16:25.630]  Enlist!
[02:16:25.630 --> 02:16:27.132]  With Hillary!
[02:16:27.132 --> 02:16:29.093]  As she comes out with her iron lung.
[02:16:29.093 --> 02:16:32.376]  I don't know, Dr. Group, you know, what else can I do?
[02:16:32.376 --> 02:16:35.439]  I'm not in the IRS.
[02:16:35.439 --> 02:16:37.861]  I've reported on David Brock's super PACs.
[02:16:37.861 --> 02:16:39.603]  I've reported on what he's doing.
[02:16:39.603 --> 02:16:40.564]  We know what he's doing.
[02:16:41.004 --> 02:16:41.984]  I mean, what else can we do?
[02:16:41.984 --> 02:16:42.645]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:16:42.645 --> 02:16:46.806]  We report on all this stuff, but nothing gets done about it.
[02:16:46.806 --> 02:16:50.248]  I mean, there's no independent investigation.
[02:16:53.726 --> 02:17:04.238]  Organizations that are put together to look at all this stuff, and yet we have some tiny phone call where we have the whole Senate and Congress and the whole government looking at it.
[02:17:04.238 --> 02:17:09.984]  This is the kind of corruption that I'm hoping will eventually end in the government.
[02:17:09.984 --> 02:17:11.446]  And that's my thing too, Dr. Krupa.
[02:17:11.866 --> 02:17:14.048]  I mean, I'm honestly not the smartest guy in the world.
[02:17:14.048 --> 02:17:16.830]  I can barely even do any math, okay?
[02:17:16.830 --> 02:17:24.756]  But I have a knack for following all the news, connecting the dots, and then coming on here like Tasmanian Devil and trying to bring people the news.
[02:17:24.756 --> 02:17:31.921]  But then there's actual people who are smart who can go into the muck and explain this stuff like Andrew Kerr, who then files the report.
[02:17:32.381 --> 02:17:39.526]  Breaks down the numbers, gets the information, gets the addresses, shows you where it happens, and then nothing gets done!
[02:17:39.526 --> 02:17:42.027]  And so we report on it, we try to get it out there.
[02:17:42.027 --> 02:17:51.894]  Thank you, Eric, for the call, and we showed the article there, and we'll try to actually find the original Andrew Kerr piece that was from the Citizens Audit that has the petition.
[02:17:51.894 --> 02:17:52.654]  Thank you, Eric.
[02:17:52.654 --> 02:17:57.617]  Let's go to Raymond, who is calling in from Illinois, who wants to talk about censorship.
[02:17:57.617 --> 02:17:58.238]  Go ahead, Raymond.
[02:17:59.761 --> 02:18:00.281]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:00.281 --> 02:18:00.881]  I love your show.
[02:18:00.881 --> 02:18:03.922]  I've been listening for 15 plus years.
[02:18:03.922 --> 02:18:06.523]  This is in regards to Facebook.
[02:18:06.523 --> 02:18:13.184]  I listen to your stories not only on the radio, but I listen on Facebook.
[02:18:13.184 --> 02:18:20.106]  Well, in the past three days, I've been had to do a security check 80 plus times.
[02:18:20.106 --> 02:18:22.606]  Then they knock me off.
[02:18:22.606 --> 02:18:25.687]  What do you mean a security check?
[02:18:25.687 --> 02:18:27.348]  That's what it says, security check.
[02:18:27.348 --> 02:18:29.168]  I don't know if they think I'm a bot or something.
[02:18:30.233 --> 02:18:33.214]  So I don't understand, a pop-up and then you have to like type something in?
[02:18:33.214 --> 02:18:34.474]  Yeah, it pops up.
[02:18:34.474 --> 02:18:36.494]  To make sure you're not a bot.
[02:18:36.494 --> 02:18:37.615]  Okay, yeah.
[02:18:37.615 --> 02:18:38.455]  Yeah.
[02:18:38.455 --> 02:18:44.796]  Well, but the thing is, I noticed and I started writing all these down and taking pictures of it.
[02:18:44.796 --> 02:18:54.578]  Every time it's either on anything about Obama, the Clintons, refugees, illegal aliens, that's what gets the check.
[02:18:55.700 --> 02:19:01.666]  Yeah, and we've had Paul Joseph Watson report on this, a ton of independent journalists are reporting on this.
[02:19:01.666 --> 02:19:08.533]  I'll be perfectly honest, I haven't been on Facebook in like four or five years, so I don't even know what's going on there anymore.
[02:19:08.533 --> 02:19:10.354]  It's a total trash heap.
[02:19:10.354 --> 02:19:12.396]  So I got out of there, I just couldn't stand it anymore.
[02:19:13.217 --> 02:19:16.719]  In fact, you know what, Dr. Group, you've got a story about what Facebook is doing to people's mental health.
[02:19:16.719 --> 02:19:17.540]  As a matter of fact, I do.
[02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:19.081]  Real quick, real quick before the break.
[02:19:19.081 --> 02:19:20.242]  So listen to this story.
[02:19:20.242 --> 02:19:23.864]  This social media site ranked worst for mental health.
[02:19:23.864 --> 02:19:34.311]  It's just really, it's really sad to me when you start looking at our children and what's going on with our children and them being put on all these medications for anxiety and depression and all these things.
[02:19:34.311 --> 02:19:41.815]  This, Instagram, is the most detrimental social media platform to young people's mental health according to new research in the UK.
[02:19:42.956 --> 02:19:46.398]  Snapchat is second and Facebook is third.
[02:19:46.398 --> 02:19:46.998]  So there you go.
[02:19:46.998 --> 02:19:54.842]  Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat, which allows you to edit your own image and send it to other people as fake news, is bad for your mental health.
[02:19:54.842 --> 02:19:55.483]  Shocking.
[02:19:55.483 --> 02:19:57.604]  We'll be right back with more on the other side of the Alex Jones Show.

[02:22:29.878 --> 02:22:34.602]  Tiffany Jenks was murdered October 8, 2013 at the age of 35.
[02:22:34.602 --> 02:22:40.646]  Shot in the forehead by someone she did not know and had apparently only met that night shortly prior to her death.
[02:22:40.646 --> 02:22:42.588]  Or so the Oregon Police say.
[02:22:42.588 --> 02:22:44.710]  Another mind control victim to the slaughter?
[02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:46.811]  Who really killed Tiffany Jenks?

[02:24:18.044 --> 02:24:21.926]  So, Donald Trump is winding down his foreign trip.
[02:24:21.926 --> 02:24:23.787]  I think he's in Brussels right now.
[02:24:23.787 --> 02:24:27.789]  And he will be back in the United States, I think, on Tuesday?
[02:24:27.789 --> 02:24:29.149]  Or, I'm sorry, Thursday or Friday?
[02:24:29.149 --> 02:24:30.410]  I can't remember what it is.
[02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:33.751]  But, it's funny, the leaks coming out of D.C.
[02:24:35.012 --> 02:24:37.895]  Have kind of stopped since Trump has been gone.
[02:24:37.895 --> 02:24:39.216]  That's interesting, isn't it?
[02:24:39.216 --> 02:24:42.239]  It's amazing they get these leaks as soon as Trump takes off.
[02:24:42.239 --> 02:24:45.242]  The New York Times publishes a story.
[02:24:45.242 --> 02:24:46.844]  The Washington Post publishes a story.
[02:24:46.844 --> 02:24:49.907]  Both smearing Trump with leaks from inside.
[02:24:50.868 --> 02:24:54.032]  Now Trump's been gone and the leaks have stopped.
[02:24:54.032 --> 02:24:57.375]  It comes out Joe Lieberman is not being considered anymore.
[02:24:57.375 --> 02:25:03.262]  But is President Trump preparing to fire multiple staff members for leaks?
[02:25:03.262 --> 02:25:05.104]  Here's a report on that information.
[02:25:06.257 --> 02:25:08.357]  Good evening from the North Lawn of the White House.
[02:25:08.357 --> 02:25:10.798]  We come to you tonight with breaking news.
[02:25:10.798 --> 02:25:18.119]  Sources telling One America News today that President Trump will be firing multiple staffers when he returns from his trip abroad.
[02:25:18.119 --> 02:25:23.440]  These staffers are set to be fired for leaking classified information again.
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:31.661]  We are getting word tonight here in the nation's capital that President Trump will be making a number of dismissals from his White House staff.
[02:25:31.661 --> 02:25:34.462]  A source here today at the White House told me that three people
[02:25:34.782 --> 02:25:37.625]  Have been identified as leaking classified information.
[02:25:37.625 --> 02:25:47.073]  This has been a major issue for the Trump administration since President Trump came into office on January 20th, Inauguration Day, here in Washington DC.
[02:25:47.073 --> 02:25:52.598]  One of the sources that I spoke with today though, telling me that this is criminal and that people could go to jail.
[02:25:52.598 --> 02:25:55.741]  That source went on to say that this is dangerous and also terrible.
[02:25:56.294 --> 02:25:59.076]  Yes, drain that swamp, President Trump.
[02:25:59.076 --> 02:26:02.619]  It's time for you to start firing people at will.
[02:26:02.619 --> 02:26:04.740]  I would not complain about that for one second.
[02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:09.664]  But you know, it's interesting this double standard that I continue to see, Dr. Group.
[02:26:09.664 --> 02:26:12.426]  They all want to complain about Donald Trump.
[02:26:12.426 --> 02:26:14.568]  The never-Trumpers, the anti-Trumpers, the Democrats.
[02:26:14.568 --> 02:26:17.230]  They want to complain about Donald Trump leaking intel.
[02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:22.354]  Donald Trump giving classified intel to him, who, her, the other, this, which way, that, and the other thing.
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:34.111]  But let's not forget it was Hillary Clinton that had a private server that was most likely hacked that had dozens of classified documents on it.
[02:26:34.111 --> 02:26:41.980]  So if Trump has anything to do with classification documents being leaked or classified intel being leaked, send the hounds after him.
[02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:43.201]  But if it's Hillary Clinton,
[02:26:44.113 --> 02:26:46.554]  There was no intent.
[02:26:46.554 --> 02:26:48.715]  She's an innocent angel.
[02:26:48.715 --> 02:26:54.038]  We're not going to question Hillary Clinton and the classified information that she leaked out.
[02:26:54.038 --> 02:26:56.219]  We've got to stop Trump.
[02:26:56.219 --> 02:26:58.780]  After all, he's the one that's been in government for decades.
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:00.741]  Oh wait, no, that's Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:00.741 --> 02:27:02.642]  He's the one that made the uranium deal a threat.
[02:27:02.642 --> 02:27:04.703]  Oh wait, no, that's Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:04.703 --> 02:27:07.424]  He's the one that took all the foreign money into his foundation.
[02:27:07.964 --> 02:27:09.805]  No wait, that's Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:09.805 --> 02:27:15.707]  He's the one whose campaign advisor John Podesta made stock deals with the... No wait, that was Hillary Clinton too!
[02:27:15.707 --> 02:27:16.788]  Oh, okay.
[02:27:16.788 --> 02:27:17.568]  Let's take some calls.
[02:27:17.568 --> 02:27:19.249]  Let's go to John in Wisconsin.
[02:27:19.249 --> 02:27:20.910]  He's actually got a question for Dr. Group.
[02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:21.570]  Go ahead, John.
[02:27:21.570 --> 02:27:28.313]  Yeah, actually I got questions for both of you, but Dr. Group first.
[02:27:28.313 --> 02:27:34.956]  In your research and or feedback, have you gotten anything from people who suffer from TBI?
[02:27:36.792 --> 02:27:41.456]  Traumatic brain injury.
[02:27:41.456 --> 02:27:42.457]  Yes, yes.
[02:27:42.457 --> 02:27:50.865]  Yeah, that's actually a lot of soldiers coming back from the war that were involved with explosions.
[02:27:50.865 --> 02:27:56.310]  They have temporary brain inflammation or some sort of brain damage from that.
[02:27:56.310 --> 02:27:58.772]  And there are some things that you can do to really
[02:28:00.854 --> 02:28:03.976]  You know, kind of repair some of that damage.
[02:28:03.976 --> 02:28:09.518]  Number one is obviously going to avoid any, you know, metals that you're bringing in.
[02:28:09.518 --> 02:28:15.221]  You can get your mercury amalgams removed, and you want to look at what are the things that really affect the brain tissue.
[02:28:15.221 --> 02:28:18.663]  A lot of it's aluminum, mercury, and you have your fluoride and your halogens.
[02:28:18.663 --> 02:28:21.224]  So, you know, really cleaning up your food supply.
[02:28:21.224 --> 02:28:28.308]  I tell you though, I've been doing a lot of research on fasting lately, and this goes back thousands of years, and I myself have completed
[02:28:29.089 --> 02:28:34.966]  Five day water fast recently and have been doing intermittent fasting and kind of doing a lot of research projects on myself.
[02:28:36.346 --> 02:28:42.488]  And there have been a lot of studies that have come out on how fasting literally regenerates tissue.
[02:28:42.488 --> 02:28:52.211]  As a matter of fact, USC came out with a study saying three days, 72-hour fast regenerates your immune system, and fasting actually recreates stem cells.
[02:28:52.211 --> 02:28:59.053]  Unfortunately, in my research, I found that a lot of that scientific material was burned because it was very popular.
[02:28:59.053 --> 02:28:59.654]  Think about it.
[02:28:59.654 --> 02:29:01.674]  If you, 100 years ago, 200 years ago, if you don't have
[02:29:04.275 --> 02:29:06.956]  The knowledge of herbs or anything like that.
[02:29:06.956 --> 02:29:09.156]  What did people do when they got sick?
[02:29:09.156 --> 02:29:13.717]  They used the sun, they used the air, and they used the water to heal themselves.
[02:29:13.717 --> 02:29:16.878]  I mean, healing the body doesn't have to be super, super hard.
[02:29:16.878 --> 02:29:19.439]  Really, everything is in simplicity.
[02:29:19.439 --> 02:29:25.460]  And all the mineral spas, all of that stuff that was around for ages was all burned and was all shut down.
[02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:27.521]  So I would say look into fasting.
[02:29:27.521 --> 02:29:33.202]  The DNA Force also, as well as the Survival Shield X2, should be some products I would recommend.
[02:29:33.302 --> 02:29:37.346]  Yeah, and you talk about the heavy metals that attack the brain, specifically the pineal gland.
[02:29:37.346 --> 02:29:40.028]  Survival Shield X2 is amazing for the pineal gland.
[02:29:40.028 --> 02:29:44.793]  And don't forget the new product, Z-Shield, a heavy metal detox fire at Infowarstore.com.
[02:29:44.793 --> 02:29:46.815]  Memorial Day Special running right now.
[02:29:46.815 --> 02:29:50.699]  We take a break, Owen Troyer, Dr. Group, and we'll be right back on the other side.
[02:29:50.699 --> 02:29:53.101]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.101 --> 02:29:55.764]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.781 --> 02:30:11.503]  Fox News has a new television host, and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories about Seth Rich.
[02:30:11.503 --> 02:30:18.405]  Let the Rich family get the closure that they need properly, and not with your crazy conspiracy theories on the internet.
[02:30:18.405 --> 02:30:19.585]  Save them for Bigfoot.
[02:30:19.585 --> 02:30:29.408]  In the post-Roger Ailes era of the Fox News Network, Liberal Democrat host Julie Roginsky went after Seth Rich conspiracy theorists.
[02:30:29.548 --> 02:30:32.510]  Listen, WikiLeaks was in collaboration with the Russians.
[02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:33.150]  How do we know this?
[02:30:33.150 --> 02:30:38.114]  Because the entire intelligence community said that the Russians were the ones that hacked into these emails.
[02:30:38.114 --> 02:30:47.180]  Meanwhile, evidence continues to surface that Seth Rich did in fact have contact with WikiLeaks before he was murdered.
[02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:55.505]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clinton crime family.

[02:32:00.595 --> 02:32:14.951]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[02:32:14.951 --> 02:32:17.254]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[02:32:17.754 --> 02:32:21.736]  is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[02:32:21.736 --> 02:32:34.084]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.

[02:33:08.149 --> 02:33:12.995]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[02:33:12.995 --> 02:33:16.459]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.459 --> 02:33:20.103]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:20.103 --> 02:33:23.287]  That's Chris Cornell who brought us in today.
[02:33:23.287 --> 02:33:24.248]  May he rest in peace.
[02:33:25.169 --> 02:33:35.993]  Apparently he committed suicide after taking a pharmaceutical pill that says, right on the insert, suicidal thoughts are a side effect.
[02:33:35.993 --> 02:33:37.574]  So may Chris Cornell rest in peace.
[02:33:37.574 --> 02:33:44.617]  You'd be amazed at how many kids are committing suicide on anti-psychotic drugs and military for that as well.
[02:33:44.617 --> 02:33:45.357]  22 to 25 suicides a day.
[02:33:48.368 --> 02:34:04.889]  It's uh, so you're, they're giving you an anti-psychotic and it's causing you to create... Look, there was a five-year-old kid that stabbed his dog to death not too long ago because he was put on anti-psychotic drugs and children are literally hanging themselves in the closets.
[02:34:05.009 --> 02:34:06.050]  I mean, it is sick.
[02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:09.112]  It is absolutely sick what's going on out there.
[02:34:09.112 --> 02:34:12.894]  And that's, you know, that's what our mission is, is to try to help as many people as we can.
[02:34:12.894 --> 02:34:18.397]  Because it's not that the kid, see, again, they're not addressing the root cause of the problem.
[02:34:18.397 --> 02:34:22.520]  It's not that the kid has these mysterious mental illnesses.
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:24.701]  You look at what causes mental illness.
[02:34:24.701 --> 02:34:32.026]  I mean, aside from PTSD, which is obviously, you know, associated with some traumatic event, all these other mental illnesses
[02:34:33.522 --> 02:34:47.546]  Are a direct relation to your gut, how toxic you are, the GMO foods that you're eating, the MSG, the excitotoxins, the artificial colors, the artificial sweeteners, the vaccinations that the kids are getting.
[02:34:47.546 --> 02:34:48.826]  I mean, it's all linked.
[02:34:48.826 --> 02:34:51.807]  You can find all of the documented science and research there.
[02:34:51.807 --> 02:34:52.407]  So what do the...
[02:34:53.089 --> 02:34:54.750]  What do the doctors do?
[02:34:54.750 --> 02:34:58.811]  Oh, little Johnny, you're having problems with anxiety.
[02:34:58.811 --> 02:35:05.513]  Here's a pill that actually contains 50% fluoride anyway, because they use fluoride in all the anti-psychotic medications.
[02:35:05.513 --> 02:35:07.314]  And I might get a little... It dumbs you down.
[02:35:07.314 --> 02:35:15.977]  I might get a little greenbacks for prescribing this to you as well, and prescribing it to little Susie, and then little Peter, and then little Paul, and then little Nancy.
[02:35:15.977 --> 02:35:17.157]  We're going to get them all on the pill.
[02:35:17.157 --> 02:35:20.178]  And then little Paul pushes his sister down the stairs and, you know,
[02:35:20.518 --> 02:35:20.738]  I don't
[02:35:41.878 --> 02:35:43.680]  Medical malpractice deaths in heroin.
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:44.861]  Let me just say one thing.
[02:35:44.861 --> 02:35:53.088]  If someone out there is addicted to opioids, which is huge, most likely you're constipated, which I would recommend taking OxyPowder.
[02:35:53.088 --> 02:35:55.550]  But you have to go outside.
[02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:58.833]  I gifted OxyPowder to a friend of mine.
[02:35:58.833 --> 02:36:00.575]  All the phone calls I got the next week.
[02:36:00.575 --> 02:36:02.336]  Oh my gosh.
[02:36:02.336 --> 02:36:03.157]  What I'm saying is the
[02:36:05.267 --> 02:36:10.330]  You know, I forgot what I was talking about now because I was thinking about oxy powder, but it's, you know... Pharmaceuticals getting into your gut.
[02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:14.272]  Pharmaceuticals are getting into your gut, they're destroying you, and the answer is simple.
[02:36:14.272 --> 02:36:16.693]  All you need to do is cleanse your body on a regular basis.
[02:36:16.693 --> 02:36:18.714]  I know you want to go back to this phone call here.
[02:36:18.714 --> 02:36:20.815]  Yeah, we had a... Yeah, go ahead.
[02:36:20.815 --> 02:36:25.398]  I just wanted to let everybody know that today I printed out a stack of articles to show that
[02:36:26.258 --> 02:36:28.019]  We are making a difference.
[02:36:28.019 --> 02:36:32.661]  I just want to run through these real fast because we don't hear about all the good things a lot of times.
[02:36:32.661 --> 02:36:37.663]  We don't hear about all the positive changes that children and people are making all over the world.
[02:36:37.663 --> 02:36:42.646]  And so here's a guy in China because we know China is so infested with smog.
[02:36:43.246 --> 02:36:43.626]  That is
[02:36:59.901 --> 02:37:09.466]  People, just like you, just like me, just like all the InfoWarriors out there, are actually taking action and saying, let's do something to change the world.
[02:37:09.466 --> 02:37:13.849]  Let's do something to change the city that we live in and let's make a difference in the world.
[02:37:13.849 --> 02:37:17.971]  We sell air purifiers, the Alexa Pure Air Purifier at InfoWarriorStore.com.
[02:37:18.251 --> 02:37:21.714]  Here's a kid right here.
[02:37:21.714 --> 02:37:23.335]  Her name is Claire Vlases.
[02:37:23.335 --> 02:37:32.083]  She's an eighth grade girl who led a student campaign to raise $118,000 so that solar panels can be installed at her middle school.
[02:37:32.083 --> 02:37:35.525]  I mean, these are all individuals that are making change.
[02:37:35.525 --> 02:37:39.068]  Why didn't that middle school have solar panels, you know, years and years ago?
[02:37:40.117 --> 02:37:42.419]  We have a plastic problem all over the world.
[02:37:42.419 --> 02:37:46.882]  We have plastic the size of Texas and Ireland floating around in the ocean.
[02:37:46.882 --> 02:37:56.229]  All of a sudden, a guy notices his beehives, the waxworms in the beehives, he puts them in a plastic bag and he notices holes in the plastic bag.
[02:37:57.029 --> 02:38:08.681]  A chance discovery just by chance revealed that for the first time maybe we can have a solution to our plastic problem and it was right there with wax worms.
[02:38:08.681 --> 02:38:11.944]  So these are all things that independent people are doing.
[02:38:12.921 --> 02:38:14.901]  That are making a difference in the world.
[02:38:14.901 --> 02:38:25.464]  Yeah, I think it was an independent inventor too that invented a, you know, a surface scraping device on the ocean that can help get some of that oil spills out.
[02:38:25.464 --> 02:38:28.324]  I think that that was another independent guy that came out with that.
[02:38:28.324 --> 02:38:37.626]  Right, I mean it's, the point is that we are making little, little differences and little changes add up to big differences and big changes.
[02:38:37.626 --> 02:38:40.607]  And one of the things we've been talking about is the problem with seeds.
[02:38:40.607 --> 02:38:41.027]  We have
[02:38:41.767 --> 02:38:45.768]  Medicinal herbs and plants going extinct every single day.
[02:38:45.768 --> 02:38:53.191]  And here we have, just announced on the 26th today, mats.com of seed savings.
[02:38:53.191 --> 02:38:58.573]  So we have 75% of seed varieties have disappeared since the dawn of the 20th century.
[02:38:59.853 --> 02:39:04.335]  And the vast majority of what remains now rests in the hands of guess who?
[02:39:04.335 --> 02:39:06.156]  Monsanto and Syngenta.
[02:39:06.156 --> 02:39:06.936]  Oh good lord.
[02:39:06.936 --> 02:39:08.957]  So now we have a global seed network.
[02:39:08.957 --> 02:39:14.579]  It's an online tool for small growers to share their heirloom seeds and protect that.
[02:39:14.579 --> 02:39:17.000]  I've been talking about how Monsanto and Syngenta
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:27.466]  And the seed project that Bill Gates is involved with for years is destroying our seeds through soil amendments, through glyphosate, through pesticides.
[02:39:27.466 --> 02:39:28.647]  It's a total power grab.
[02:39:28.647 --> 02:39:30.868]  It's a total power grab that's going on underneath.
[02:39:30.868 --> 02:39:36.712]  If you control the food and you control the water, which is Nestle's trying to do, you control everything.
[02:39:36.712 --> 02:39:39.814]  But we are fighting back and we're making a difference.
[02:39:39.814 --> 02:39:43.136]  I do want to give some props, though, to Cheerios.
[02:39:44.116 --> 02:39:48.579]  They are actually put together a campaign to try to save the bees.
[02:39:48.579 --> 02:39:57.484]  Talking about bees, and I've always said that the glyphosate and the pesticides, and look, if the bees die, people are saying that we might die.
[02:39:57.484 --> 02:40:01.326]  I think Einstein said if the bees die, humans have three years till they die.
[02:40:01.326 --> 02:40:03.348]  Yeah, I agree, because they're the pollinators.
[02:40:03.348 --> 02:40:10.072]  But anyway, the company announced Monday plans to have a hundred million wildflower seeds planted across the country.
[02:40:11.499 --> 02:40:15.140]  By offering to send wildflower seeds to people for free.
[02:40:15.140 --> 02:40:16.960]  So way to go.
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:22.542]  Although the cereal, you know, I mean, they could definitely improve and take some of the toxic stuff out of the cereal.
[02:40:22.542 --> 02:40:23.722]  Which we are starting to see.
[02:40:23.722 --> 02:40:25.083]  We were talking about that.
[02:40:25.083 --> 02:40:31.004]  You know, if you go to your local market or retail store or whatever, you can start to see these marketing campaigns.
[02:40:31.004 --> 02:40:33.365]  All natural, removing preservatives, all this stuff.
[02:40:33.365 --> 02:40:34.185]  It's like, well, thank you.
[02:40:34.185 --> 02:40:35.265]  Poisoned me for 10 years.
[02:40:35.265 --> 02:40:36.366]  Now you're not going to.
[02:40:36.366 --> 02:40:37.046]  But it is happening.
[02:40:37.506 --> 02:40:38.986]  It is happening, which is great!
[02:40:38.986 --> 02:40:40.007]  Here's another story.
[02:40:40.007 --> 02:40:43.868]  Totally biodegradable electronics could help solve e-waste problem.
[02:40:43.868 --> 02:40:46.488]  We have a huge problem with all this electronic waste.
[02:40:46.488 --> 02:40:50.489]  Yeah, people get a new cell phone every two months.
[02:40:50.489 --> 02:40:57.711]  This is a new device that disintegrates in a month by using apple cider vinegar, or just regular vinegar for that matter, and water.
[02:40:57.711 --> 02:41:02.453]  There's 50 million tons of electronics will be discarded this year alone.
[02:41:02.453 --> 02:41:03.453]  50 million tons.
[02:41:04.173 --> 02:41:10.738]  And most of that stuff is toxic plastics and chemicals that cause disease.
[02:41:10.738 --> 02:41:22.128]  So those are just pulled up a stack of good news, a stack of victories that have been pulled up just within the last few days that's happened.
[02:41:22.788 --> 02:41:25.229]  I mean, so it's incredible that people are taking action.
[02:41:25.229 --> 02:41:42.494]  I just wanted to thank everybody out there, because these children that are taking it upon themselves, individuals that are seeing the situations that are causing us to suffer, and making positive changes out there, and don't think that you can't make a positive change.
[02:41:42.494 --> 02:41:50.116]  Just everybody not buying the chemicals, not buying the chemical cosmetics, shampoos, soaps, all the stuff in your house.
[02:41:50.916 --> 02:41:54.579]  It really does work and it really does make a change.
[02:41:54.579 --> 02:42:03.507]  Well, and the food babe, Vani Hari, has been leading the way, I think, in exposing the poisons that are in food and calling these people out, forcing them to respond.
[02:42:03.507 --> 02:42:04.929]  I think Subway is a great example.
[02:42:05.785 --> 02:42:11.593]  But you know, let's also not forget the power of the dollar, Dr. Group, and the power of the free market.
[02:42:11.593 --> 02:42:21.527]  We the people, by spending our money on food products or health products that are all natural or don't have the poison, or with info wars, people that
[02:42:21.707 --> 02:42:22.287]  We're good to go.
[02:42:50.599 --> 02:43:03.089]  Well, actually, it was an idea I got that nobody else seemed to pick up on yet about the Seth Rich situation.
[02:43:03.089 --> 02:43:08.153]  And him being, he was the IT manager, okay?
[02:43:08.153 --> 02:43:13.537]  He was in control and operated all the computer systems.
[02:43:17.890 --> 02:43:18.390]  Yes.
[02:43:18.390 --> 02:43:27.297]  Now, one of the guys there behind the scenes at InfoWars mentioned that there was a woman that said that he was going to release... Yeah, that was me.
[02:43:27.297 --> 02:43:30.719]  Yeah, that was me.
[02:43:30.719 --> 02:43:31.700]  But here's the thing, though.
[02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:32.360]  Here's the thing.
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:35.182]  I can't verify that letter.
[02:43:35.182 --> 02:43:37.544]  That's why I couldn't really run with the report.
[02:43:37.544 --> 02:43:42.547]  I talked about the letter, but I can't verify who that came from, so I don't really know if that's true.
[02:43:42.547 --> 02:43:47.031]  But obviously the position that Seth Rich was in with the IT department
[02:43:47.771 --> 02:43:47.931]  I don't
[02:44:07.705 --> 02:44:18.015]  But apparently the Democrats were engaging in some shady work with actually the polls and where you go to vote and not doing that particularly right.
[02:44:18.015 --> 02:44:28.284]  But again, that's somebody who's more educated in how the primaries work, how the voter ID logs work, and how they count these things and tally these things.
[02:44:28.284 --> 02:44:29.365]  I don't fully understand that.
[02:44:29.365 --> 02:44:30.226]  I can just go off
[02:44:30.766 --> 02:44:41.191]  A letter that was allegedly from Seth Rich's girlfriend saying that he had proof that the DNC was rigging the voter rolls to skew the results in Hillary's favor.
[02:44:41.191 --> 02:44:45.072]  But I can't clarify that letter, so there's nothing really more I can report on that.
[02:44:45.072 --> 02:44:46.293]  Thank you for the call, John.
[02:44:46.293 --> 02:44:49.634]  Let's go to Robert in California.
[02:44:49.634 --> 02:44:51.335]  Another petition caller.
[02:44:51.335 --> 02:44:54.376]  What's up, Robert?
[02:44:54.376 --> 02:44:56.297]  Oh, and Dr. Grip, what an honor.
[02:44:56.297 --> 02:44:58.318]  So this is, is this Robert, guys?
[02:44:58.318 --> 02:44:59.859]  I'm sorry, I can't see who's on air right now.
[02:45:01.291 --> 02:45:02.071]  Yes, it's Robert.
[02:45:02.071 --> 02:45:02.932]  Okay, thanks Robert.
[02:45:02.932 --> 02:45:04.612]  Go ahead.
[02:45:04.612 --> 02:45:09.414]  Hey listen, I'm in a small pocket here in California just south of Fresno.
[02:45:09.414 --> 02:45:17.316]  I can't get a petition going and what I want to get out to most of the people is that we need petitions.
[02:45:17.316 --> 02:45:21.778]  We need to get a petition out to repeal the Patriot Act.
[02:45:21.778 --> 02:45:29.140]  We need a petition so we can go after these corporations and go after them
[02:45:29.608 --> 02:45:37.434]  Because, you know, if you go after one, you know, they're so... Well, what corporations are you talking about exactly?
[02:45:37.434 --> 02:45:38.435]  What corporations?
[02:45:38.435 --> 02:45:44.580]  Because we can go after corporations by not spending money with them anymore.
[02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:50.625]  You know, these are also corporations that you have to have because they're almost like a necessity.
[02:45:50.625 --> 02:45:52.107]  Take AT&T or Comcast.
[02:45:52.107 --> 02:45:56.150]  So you're talking about commodities?
[02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:57.371]  And, yeah, well, you know,
[02:45:57.864 --> 02:46:03.800]  They're able to take your information and spread it around and this is one of the things that we need.
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:05.103]  So this is an interesting point.
[02:46:06.989 --> 02:46:16.395]  It used to be that Facebook basically had a monopoly on getting all the algorithms, all the details, all the metadata and sharing that.
[02:46:16.395 --> 02:46:24.560]  Donald Trump signed a bill, whether you like it or not, I suppose perhaps you don't like it, but he signed a bill making it so anybody can do it now.
[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:28.563]  Verizon, AT&T, all that metadata, all that data that
[02:46:29.423 --> 02:46:38.249]  When you check, accept the terms and conditions, you share, that's all your data, you give it all up to them, so now anybody can have it and anybody can use it.
[02:46:38.249 --> 02:46:42.552]  So, you know, I don't know if the government is going to be able to step in or do anything about that.
[02:46:42.552 --> 02:46:47.295]  I would say it's up to the consumers to kind of dictate that flow.
[02:46:47.295 --> 02:46:53.599]  Again, if nobody's using Facebook and it's obvious because they don't like their information being shared, guess what?
[02:46:53.599 --> 02:46:55.901]  Facebook is going to stop sharing your information.
[02:46:58.835 --> 02:46:59.316]  I think so.
[02:47:11.463 --> 02:47:14.645]  You've seen the graph where they're all connected.
[02:47:14.645 --> 02:47:16.866]  You boycott, let's say, some cereal.
[02:47:16.866 --> 02:47:18.046]  No, I hear what he's talking about.
[02:47:18.046 --> 02:47:23.109]  He's talking about the continuity of government and the continuity of all these establishment corporations.
[02:47:23.109 --> 02:47:32.474]  I can guarantee you that over the last ten years, we've put a huge dent in the pocketbooks because ten years ago, no one even knew what genetically modified foods are.
[02:47:32.474 --> 02:47:34.615]  We had March Against Monsanto.
[02:47:34.615 --> 02:47:40.638]  Now, because there's so many foods that have that non-GMO seal on it, and because it's
[02:47:42.899 --> 02:47:48.280]  You have the big corporations that, look, they ridiculed organic foods.
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:54.082]  I mean, for years, when Whole Foods came out, it was the only organic store where you could get organic food.
[02:47:54.082 --> 02:47:56.903]  Now you can find organic food in the airport.
[02:47:56.903 --> 02:48:01.504]  I mean, I can go in the airport and go to any of the stores in there and find organic stuff to eat.
[02:48:01.504 --> 02:48:03.365]  You can find it everywhere.
[02:48:03.365 --> 02:48:09.207]  So at first, they push up against it and they ridicule it and they say, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:48:10.245 --> 02:48:19.248]  When it starts hurting their pocket and the money starts leaving them and going to organic, then they make the change.
[02:48:19.248 --> 02:48:22.209]  And you've seen that in big companies and you've seen that across the board.
[02:48:22.209 --> 02:48:23.810]  So we are making a difference.
[02:48:23.810 --> 02:48:26.431]  I can tell you that because I'm right in that every single day.
[02:48:26.431 --> 02:48:27.671]  And it's not an overnight process.
[02:48:27.671 --> 02:48:28.091]  How's it going guys?
[02:48:28.091 --> 02:48:30.494]  I just wanted to say, I just think it's hilarious, well not funny, but it's just ironic that
[02:48:55.020 --> 02:49:07.084]  The day after that bombing in the UK, who comes on but the talking point for Operation Mockingbird and John Brennan, that scum.
[02:49:07.084 --> 02:49:11.506]  Yeah, John Brennan who wouldn't even do his oath on the Bible.
[02:49:11.506 --> 02:49:14.747]  He's a literal Wahhabist, treasonous scum.
[02:49:14.747 --> 02:49:15.728]  He works for ISIS.
[02:49:15.728 --> 02:49:16.508]  Yeah, he's a piece of trash.
[02:49:17.779 --> 02:49:20.121]  Yeah, he lies all the time about intelligence.
[02:49:20.121 --> 02:49:22.142]  Why would I trust John Brennan?
[02:49:22.142 --> 02:49:24.323]  So why isn't there an investigation on Brennan?
[02:49:24.323 --> 02:49:25.724]  You know what I mean?
[02:49:25.724 --> 02:49:28.566]  And that has to be the most frustrating thing, Dr. Group.
[02:49:28.566 --> 02:49:32.909]  You know, I mean, look, I'm just, I am a reporter for InfoWars.com, okay?
[02:49:33.789 --> 02:49:36.371]  I don't have any secret clearance.
[02:49:36.371 --> 02:49:39.132]  I don't hack into anything, okay?
[02:49:39.132 --> 02:49:43.335]  I am living on the same playing field of reality as everybody else.
[02:49:43.335 --> 02:49:46.777]  And I can see John Brennan is a known liar.
[02:49:46.777 --> 02:49:49.379]  I can see John Brennan shouldn't be trusted.
[02:49:49.379 --> 02:49:51.880]  And I guess that's what the caller is voicing the frustration.
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:57.524]  How is it he gets to continue to be hoisted up here as some voice of authority?
[02:49:59.065 --> 02:50:00.025]  I mean, it's Clinton!
[02:50:00.025 --> 02:50:00.885]  It's Obama!
[02:50:00.885 --> 02:50:02.026]  It's Wasserman Schultz!
[02:50:02.026 --> 02:50:02.806]  It's the Democrats!
[02:50:02.806 --> 02:50:04.326]  I mean, it's non-stop!
[02:50:04.326 --> 02:50:09.527]  How badly do the Democrats have to be exposed via WikiLeaks and Project Veritas?
[02:50:09.527 --> 02:50:13.087]  What made Schumer the leading expert on all this stuff?
[02:50:13.087 --> 02:50:14.508]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:50:14.508 --> 02:50:19.749]  If you walked into a deli and saw Chuck Schumer slicing pastrami, what would you do?
[02:50:19.749 --> 02:50:20.549]  Get out of the deli!
[02:50:20.549 --> 02:50:22.149]  That's what everybody says!
[02:50:22.149 --> 02:50:24.049]  Everybody says the same thing!
[02:50:24.049 --> 02:50:25.130]  Chuck Schumer!
[02:50:25.130 --> 02:50:27.350]  You wouldn't buy a pastrami sandwich from the guy!
[02:50:28.169 --> 02:50:28.810]  No, no.
[02:50:28.810 --> 02:50:43.325]  I mean, you know, I hope people can see through, I mean, all of this and I wish there was a way that you could just do an executive order and just get rid of him, but obviously that wouldn't go down too well.
[02:50:43.325 --> 02:50:47.329]  You know, we wanted Trump to get in and be a wrecking ball.
[02:50:47.329 --> 02:50:49.951]  He hasn't been in for a year yet, so he's got plenty of time.
[02:50:52.878 --> 02:50:54.119]  Let's go, President Trump.
[02:50:54.119 --> 02:50:55.299]  Let's start throwing your weight around.
[02:50:55.299 --> 02:50:56.120]  He's about to be back.
[02:50:56.120 --> 02:50:57.260]  We've got more on the other side.
[02:50:57.260 --> 02:50:58.721]  More calls, more of Dr. Group.

[02:52:59.244 --> 02:53:01.205]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:53:01.205 --> 02:53:06.527]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:53:06.527 --> 02:53:08.107]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:53:08.107 --> 02:53:16.450]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:16.450 --> 02:53:22.152]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:55:30.583 --> 02:55:35.745]  All right, Dr. Group, I want to crunch these headlines real quick before we take some calls on the other side of this hour.
[02:55:35.745 --> 02:55:37.606]  We talked about the DNC lawsuit.
[02:55:37.606 --> 02:55:38.526]  You were asking about this.
[02:55:38.526 --> 02:55:39.727]  So basically what's going on?
[02:55:40.567 --> 02:55:53.454]  You have Bernie Sanders supporters in 45 states that have filed a lawsuit that they want to be repaid by the DNC for the funds that they gave for Bernie Sanders' campaign to the DNC.
[02:55:53.454 --> 02:56:04.060]  Of course, the DNC rigged it for Hillary, basically cheated, so the Bernie Sanders supporters feel cheated and they would like their money back, so the DNC is being sued right now
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:12.564]  Class action lawsuit, 45 states involved, but of course the Washington Post, the Washington Compost says that it's frivolous.
[02:56:12.564 --> 02:56:17.967]  No, it's frivolous to sue somebody that stole your money and lied about an election result.
[02:56:17.967 --> 02:56:24.450]  No, what's frivolous is to steal money and lie about an election and make it a selection.
[02:56:24.450 --> 02:56:27.592]  And of course, here's the irony, meanwhile,
[02:56:29.048 --> 02:56:31.991]  Democrats are so messed up, Dr. Group.
[02:56:31.991 --> 02:56:37.456]  Meanwhile, the FBI is investigating Bernie Sanders' wife!
[02:56:37.456 --> 02:56:38.637]  So you've got the DNC...
[02:56:40.083 --> 02:56:44.847]  That's being sued by Bernie Sanders supporters because they rigged the election for Hillary.
[02:56:44.847 --> 02:56:48.010]  So the DNC is getting sued by Bernie Sanders supporters.
[02:56:48.010 --> 02:56:53.254]  Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders supporters were duped themselves by the Sanders!
[02:56:53.254 --> 02:56:59.400]  So Bernie Sanders supporters got duped by the DNC and they also got duped by the Sanders.
[02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:04.944]  Bernie Sanders has got multiple houses, multiple cars, claims to be some sort of bleeding heart liberal, totally a fraud.
[02:57:04.944 --> 02:57:06.366]  And then Bernie Sanders' wife
[02:57:06.866 --> 02:57:12.991]  Making sketchy land deals, sketchy... She's being looked at for bank fraud right now.
[02:57:12.991 --> 02:57:13.471]  And guess what?
[02:57:13.471 --> 02:57:19.015]  The college that James Sanders was running, Burlington College, out of business.
[02:57:19.015 --> 02:57:23.339]  So now you've got the DNC being looked at because of lawsuits by Bernie Sanders supporters.
[02:57:23.339 --> 02:57:28.362]  Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders' wife is being investigated for potential bank fraud and land deals.
[02:57:28.362 --> 02:57:29.103]  So that's nice.
[02:57:29.103 --> 02:57:31.525]  Democrats are totally in disarray.
[02:57:31.525 --> 02:57:32.786]  And it just adds to it!
[02:57:34.019 --> 02:57:35.040]  This is from the Daily Caller.
[02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:36.801]  Yeah, Elijah, you've been deceived, bro!
[02:57:36.801 --> 02:57:38.042]  It wasn't Russia that leaked the emails.
[02:57:38.042 --> 02:57:38.503]  It came from inside!
[02:57:56.266 --> 02:58:07.736]  And the air of deception is the mainstream media and the deep state trying to distract from the fact that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta had Russia collusion and that they were trying to steal the election.
[02:58:07.736 --> 02:58:09.998]  The whole thing was set up for Hillary Clinton to win.
[02:58:09.998 --> 02:58:11.639]  It was a rigged job from the beginning.
[02:58:11.639 --> 02:58:14.641]  Trump came in with the deplorables and defeated it.
[02:58:14.641 --> 02:58:23.469]  So all they're doing is blaming Russia to try to delegitimize Donald Trump and to try to reaffirm themselves as a credible news source, even though
[02:58:23.789 --> 02:58:27.451]  They were wrong the whole time and they're wrong about Russia too.
[02:58:27.451 --> 02:58:31.792]  The Democrats are in total disarray right now.
[02:58:31.792 --> 02:58:33.633]  The left is a complete mess.
[02:58:33.633 --> 02:58:37.375]  We've got more of your calls for Dr. Group and then Roger Stone on the other side.
[02:58:50.339 --> 02:58:52.220]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:58:52.220 --> 02:58:53.540]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:58:53.540 --> 02:58:54.740]  Why is this so good?
[02:58:54.740 --> 02:59:00.022]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:59:00.022 --> 02:59:13.565]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:59:13.565 --> 02:59:14.926]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:59:15.706 --> 02:59:17.348]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:59:17.348 --> 02:59:19.931]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:59:19.931 --> 02:59:21.233]  These are all parasites.
[02:59:21.233 --> 02:59:22.334]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:59:22.334 --> 02:59:23.676]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:59:23.676 --> 02:59:28.181]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:59:28.181 --> 02:59:31.325]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:59:31.445 --> 02:59:34.508]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:59:34.508 --> 02:59:35.568]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:59:35.568 --> 02:59:37.490]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:37.490 --> 02:59:38.511]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:59:38.511 --> 02:59:41.213]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:59:41.213 --> 02:59:44.496]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:44.496 --> 02:59:46.738]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:59:46.738 --> 02:59:52.242]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:59:52.242 --> 02:59:54.825]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:21.492 --> 03:00:23.554]  We are waiting to get Roger Stone on board.
[03:00:23.554 --> 03:00:28.977]  In the meantime, in the break, Dr. Group had asked me, we were talking about the left pushing for impeachment.
[03:00:28.977 --> 03:00:30.879]  He was saying, yeah, they're clearly mad.
[03:00:30.879 --> 03:00:32.880]  Do you really think they'll go for impeachment?
[03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:35.121]  And then he asked me, what do I think is going to happen the next 60 days?
[03:00:35.121 --> 03:00:36.863]  I don't think it's necessarily 60 days.
[03:00:36.863 --> 03:00:41.806]  I think the time frame that I'm looking at right now is the 2018 midterm elections.
[03:00:41.806 --> 03:00:43.107]  Basically, I think that
[03:00:44.227 --> 03:00:56.812]  They either have a plan in place to impeach Trump, or they don't understand the epic loss they're going to take in 2018 because nobody's buying this anymore.
[03:00:56.812 --> 03:01:04.275]  So I do think they're going to continue with impeach, impeach, impeach, at least to try to delegitimize him as president.
[03:01:04.275 --> 03:01:07.396]  But if they don't do anything by 2018, they're done.
[03:01:07.396 --> 03:01:08.617]  And I think they know that.
[03:01:08.617 --> 03:01:12.178]  What are the positive changes you see happening in the next, let's say, six months?
[03:01:12.563 --> 03:01:16.248]  I think the 2018 midterm elections are going to be great for the American people.
[03:01:16.248 --> 03:01:19.432]  I think that people are more concerned about politics now.
[03:01:19.432 --> 03:01:20.674]  They're more engaged.
[03:01:20.674 --> 03:01:22.717]  They're paying attention to these people.
[03:01:22.717 --> 03:01:27.303]  You've got people that are now actually fired up to run against some of the swamp creatures like
[03:01:27.503 --> 03:01:27.803]  I think so.
[03:01:48.852 --> 03:02:03.390]  So I think 2018 midterms elections are going to be great and either the Democrats are so disillusioned they don't understand the epic loss they're going to suffer there or they really think that they can get Trump out of office before that and then on go with the deep state globalist agenda.
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:05.280]  That's what I think.
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:05.820]  Sounds good.
[03:02:05.820 --> 03:02:11.182]  Do you think that we'll have a ramification of the tax bill or health care happening this year?
[03:02:11.182 --> 03:02:13.123]  They keep putting the tax bill off.
[03:02:13.123 --> 03:02:19.784]  All of the victory laps that they took for the health care bill in the House is going to look foolish once it fails in the Senate.
[03:02:19.784 --> 03:02:20.365]  That's what I think.
[03:02:20.365 --> 03:02:21.405]  You ready to take a couple calls?
[03:02:21.405 --> 03:02:21.765]  Let's do it.
[03:02:21.765 --> 03:02:24.186]  Let's go to Sean, who's got a health question for Dr. Group.
[03:02:24.186 --> 03:02:24.706]  Go ahead, Sean.
[03:02:26.570 --> 03:02:27.451]  Yes.
[03:02:27.451 --> 03:02:36.936]  Before I get started, I just want to let you guys know, from here you will witness the final destruction of the Empire, and an end to their final rebellion.
[03:02:36.936 --> 03:02:41.779]  The force is strong in this one.
[03:02:41.779 --> 03:02:46.942]  Yeah, you guys might also know me as Humanity on Planet Earth, but that's for another time.
[03:02:47.617 --> 03:02:57.048]  Right now I'm actually looking into... I'm autodidactic, so I don't really go chasing around the paperwork from Harvard and all the other institutions.
[03:02:57.048 --> 03:03:04.116]  I'm a big fan of Marque Paseo, who actually got turned on from you guys, which his acronym, if you break his name down, comes out to MAP.
[03:03:04.116 --> 03:03:08.080]  I call him Mr. MAP because he really brought me to another level on a documentary called
[03:03:08.993 --> 03:03:12.997]  Christians, no, Jesus was an anarchist and Christians are statists.
[03:03:12.997 --> 03:03:13.938]  You guys gotta check that out.
[03:03:13.938 --> 03:03:14.859]  It was really deep.
[03:03:14.859 --> 03:03:27.671]  But anyway, for Dr. Group, I have these cysts on my neck and I'm looking to heal myself and I'm looking into GCMAF, which I understand some doctors might have been getting murdered over and it's very hard to get here in the States.
[03:03:27.671 --> 03:03:29.613]  And I was going to combine that with ozone therapy.
[03:03:29.613 --> 03:03:30.534]  What are your thoughts on that?
[03:03:31.482 --> 03:03:36.186]  Well GCMAF has been under attack now for probably about four or five years.
[03:03:36.186 --> 03:03:37.928]  It was incredibly... Now what is that?
[03:03:37.928 --> 03:03:38.669]  I'm not familiar.
[03:03:38.669 --> 03:03:39.669]  It's a nagalase.
[03:03:39.669 --> 03:03:48.237]  It actually works with the nagalase enzyme in the body and it's a way to regenerate and block any type of
[03:03:49.278 --> 03:03:52.119]  Really, it was focusing on cancer cells.
[03:03:52.119 --> 03:03:53.779]  Oh, they had to shut that down.
[03:03:53.779 --> 03:03:54.559]  That's a trillion-dollar industry.
[03:03:54.559 --> 03:04:10.283]  So, Nagelace is an enzyme that's being restricted in the body and GCMAF actually turns on the Nagelace enzyme and they found that the Nagelace enzyme has very healing properties and actually prevents and heals tissue, damaged tissue in the body whenever the body recognizes that.
[03:04:10.283 --> 03:04:15.685]  There's been many doctors that have allegedly been killed because of their work with GCMAF.
[03:04:17.293 --> 03:04:27.956]  The beginning of time when all of these cancer cures, these natural cancer cures, have been developed and implemented in systems over the last 50, 60, 70, 80, 100 years.
[03:04:27.956 --> 03:04:31.317]  And these doctors have mysteriously been gone missing.
[03:04:31.317 --> 03:04:37.959]  And I've even been attacked from our cancer clinic where we actually used ozone very successfully.
[03:04:37.959 --> 03:04:41.200]  So, regarding your cysts, one of the biggest
[03:04:41.960 --> 03:04:45.262]  Situations we find with cysts is iodine deficiency.
[03:04:45.262 --> 03:04:55.449]  So I would definitely do a lot of cleansing, repair the gut, multiple liver and gallbladder cleanses, and then look at the benefits of iodine for your cysts as well as DNA force.
[03:04:55.449 --> 03:04:58.531]  We'll be right back with Dr. Group and Roger Stone on the other side.
[03:05:01.178 --> 03:05:10.903]  Fox News has a new television host, and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories about Seth Rich.
[03:05:10.903 --> 03:05:17.806]  Let the Rich family get the closure that they need properly, and not with your crazy conspiracy theories on the internet.
[03:05:17.806 --> 03:05:18.986]  Save them for Bigfoot.
[03:05:18.986 --> 03:05:28.811]  In the post-Roger Ailes era of the Fox News Network, Liberal Democrat host Julie Roginsky went after Seth Rich conspiracy theorists.
[03:05:28.971 --> 03:05:31.912]  Listen, WikiLeaks was in collaboration with the Russians.
[03:05:31.912 --> 03:05:32.552]  How do we know this?
[03:05:32.552 --> 03:05:37.514]  Because the entire intelligence community said that the Russians were the ones that hacked into these emails.
[03:05:37.514 --> 03:05:46.578]  Meanwhile, evidence continues to surface that Seth Rich did, in fact, have contact with WikiLeaks before he was murdered.
[03:05:46.578 --> 03:05:54.661]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clinton crime family.
[03:05:54.661 --> 03:05:58.543]  I'm Darren McBreen, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.
[03:06:00.283 --> 03:06:10.867]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:06:10.867 --> 03:06:12.928]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:06:12.928 --> 03:06:15.809]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:06:15.809 --> 03:06:17.289]  It's made in the USA.
[03:06:17.289 --> 03:06:24.111]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:06:24.111 --> 03:06:25.392]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:06:26.192 --> 03:06:35.900]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:06:35.900 --> 03:06:52.712]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:06:52.712 --> 03:06:55.895]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:06:56.015 --> 03:06:59.617]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:20.307 --> 03:07:23.488]  High-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[03:07:23.488 --> 03:07:28.129]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[03:07:28.129 --> 03:07:35.251]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[03:07:35.251 --> 03:07:36.392]  It's all there.
[03:07:36.392 --> 03:07:37.072]  The Body Wash.
[03:07:37.372 --> 03:07:41.835]  The shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[03:07:41.835 --> 03:07:52.563]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:07:52.563 --> 03:07:55.185]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[03:07:55.185 --> 03:07:59.248]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[03:08:05.047 --> 03:08:11.536]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:08:11.536 --> 03:08:13.839]  It's Owen Troyer.
[03:08:13.839 --> 03:08:16.482]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:21.021 --> 03:08:23.843]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:23.843 --> 03:08:25.645]  Owen Troyer filling in with Dr. Group.
[03:08:25.645 --> 03:08:27.186]  It's been a pleasure.
[03:08:27.186 --> 03:08:28.267]  Truly has been a pleasure.
[03:08:28.267 --> 03:08:32.691]  Not just to fill in for Alex Jones, which was once a dream of mine, but to be on air with you, Dr. Group.
[03:08:32.691 --> 03:08:33.151]  Always a pleasure.
[03:08:33.151 --> 03:08:34.332]  Yeah, it's been great.
[03:08:34.332 --> 03:08:38.015]  And I gotta remind you guys out there, Memorial Day weekend is coming up.
[03:08:38.015 --> 03:08:44.380]  Gotta love Memorial Day, and you gotta love the Memorial Day specials that are going on right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:08:44.380 --> 03:08:46.522]  Check these specials out, folks.
[03:08:46.522 --> 03:08:46.983]  Honestly,
[03:08:48.084 --> 03:08:55.150]  These specials are so great, especially if maybe, perhaps, because of a financial situation, you haven't been able to buy and try some of these products.
[03:08:55.150 --> 03:08:56.091]  Now is the time.
[03:08:56.091 --> 03:09:01.495]  The best specials we have seen at Infowarsstore.com in a long time.
[03:09:01.495 --> 03:09:04.999]  We're about to be joined by Roger Stone.
[03:09:04.999 --> 03:09:07.501]  Is he ready to go right now, guys?
[03:09:07.501 --> 03:09:07.901]  All right.
[03:09:07.901 --> 03:09:09.683]  Hey, Roger, can you hear me?
[03:09:10.874 --> 03:09:13.756]  Owen Schroyer, great to see you, great to be with you.
[03:09:13.756 --> 03:09:15.638]  It's good to be with you as well, Roger.
[03:09:15.638 --> 03:09:17.639]  Well, what is on your mind today?
[03:09:17.639 --> 03:09:23.964]  We've covered the waterfront of news, and what is leading your stories right now?
[03:09:23.964 --> 03:09:33.811]  Well, first of all, Owen, you show graphically why you are on the Mr. Stone's International Best Dressed list with a killer necktie.
[03:09:35.953 --> 03:09:37.174]  I'm very proud of you.
[03:09:37.174 --> 03:09:45.520]  I, of course, today am wearing this outfit, this hat, this terrific turtleneck, these shades.
[03:09:45.520 --> 03:09:50.905]  And when I wore it previously on InfoWars, a number of leftists attacked me, not understanding
[03:09:51.874 --> 03:09:57.158]  That it was a fashion homage to Bobby Seale, to Huey Newton, to the Panthers.
[03:09:57.158 --> 03:10:01.841]  I didn't like their ideology, but these guys looked great.
[03:10:01.841 --> 03:10:09.087]  You see, the problem with the left is they have no sense of style, as well as no belief in America.
[03:10:09.087 --> 03:10:09.647]  There we go.
[03:10:09.647 --> 03:10:09.987]  You see?
[03:10:09.987 --> 03:10:13.190]  Wait a second.
[03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:15.091]  Roger, I've seen Chunk Yogurt.
[03:10:15.091 --> 03:10:17.333]  I've seen Chunk Yogurt hosting the Young Turks.
[03:10:17.333 --> 03:10:20.255]  I mean, the guy is clearly put together with that suit he's got.
[03:10:20.939 --> 03:10:22.660]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[03:10:22.660 --> 03:10:24.380]  And I've loved watching you guys.
[03:10:24.380 --> 03:10:27.821]  I love, here you go, you get another image.
[03:10:27.821 --> 03:10:31.322]  These guys had style, so it's a homage.
[03:10:31.322 --> 03:10:33.103]  Relax, leftists.
[03:10:33.103 --> 03:10:40.826]  Oh my gosh, wait a second, a Donald Trump supporter paying homage to African-American fashion?
[03:10:40.826 --> 03:10:42.746]  I can't even... Style, it's style.
[03:10:42.746 --> 03:10:43.967]  This is all about style.
[03:10:43.967 --> 03:10:45.927]  Anyway, I've enjoyed this.
[03:10:45.927 --> 03:10:47.508]  I love the doctor.
[03:10:48.648 --> 03:10:54.652]  You know, if I do a remake of Back to the Future, he is the guy to kind of play that part.
[03:10:54.652 --> 03:10:58.715]  And you guys are bringing unbelievable products to the InfoWars store.
[03:10:58.715 --> 03:11:14.885]  I mean, as you know, brain force for me is almost a requirement, given the high pace of beating back the Senate and House Intelligence Committees in my demand to testify, keeping track of the Seth
[03:11:15.405 --> 03:11:25.053]  Rich murder probe, which we're going to talk about a little later, following the president's trip nine days abroad.
[03:11:25.053 --> 03:11:27.255]  That troubles me some.
[03:11:27.255 --> 03:11:31.859]  Nine days is a long time for the president to be out of Washington.
[03:11:31.859 --> 03:11:38.144]  But the stagecraft, I think, has been generally good with a few problems we'll talk about.
[03:11:38.144 --> 03:11:42.308]  What interests me is the polling continues to show real intensity.
[03:11:43.030 --> 03:11:45.631]  And support for those who back the president.
[03:11:45.631 --> 03:11:50.153]  See, they're not buying the mainstream media takedown.
[03:11:50.153 --> 03:11:57.337]  Something they couldn't achieve at the ballot box, but they now seek to achieve through a deep state coup.
[03:11:57.337 --> 03:12:03.860]  A collusion, indeed, between the mainstream media and the left wing of the Democratic Party.
[03:12:04.850 --> 03:12:07.712]  Roger, you know, I actually have a question for you.
[03:12:07.712 --> 03:12:12.014]  There is talks right now about, obviously, the leakers from the White House.
[03:12:12.014 --> 03:12:13.775]  It's a very real situation right now.
[03:12:13.775 --> 03:12:16.296]  I think that everybody's kind of recognized that.
[03:12:16.296 --> 03:12:25.361]  The leaks magically stopped as soon as Trump took off, right after the New York Times and the Washington Compost published their smear pieces, right after Donald Trump took off.
[03:12:25.361 --> 03:12:26.742]  But then the leaks stopped.
[03:12:26.742 --> 03:12:33.986]  Now there's rumors that once Trump gets back to America, that some of these leakers have been identified and may be on the way out.
[03:12:34.366 --> 03:12:36.368]  Do you have any intel on that?
[03:12:36.368 --> 03:12:46.057]  Well, it is interesting that the leaking stopped when the president went abroad because, of course, perhaps the leakers were in the entourage.
[03:12:46.057 --> 03:12:49.641]  Perhaps those leakers are now back in Washington.
[03:12:49.641 --> 03:12:51.122]  We don't know for certain.
[03:12:52.223 --> 03:13:06.708]  On the other hand, there has been speculation in the newspapers that the president would bring in Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie as latter-day plumbers, guys in charge of finding the leaks.
[03:13:06.708 --> 03:13:08.629]  This is a terrible idea.
[03:13:08.629 --> 03:13:16.832]  First, I don't think either one of them could find their arse with both hands, as our friend Paul Joseph Watson might say, but secondarily,
[03:13:17.532 --> 03:13:22.119]  They're not attorneys, they have no law enforcement experience.
[03:13:22.119 --> 03:13:25.063]  This reminds me of G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt.
[03:13:25.063 --> 03:13:27.447]  These guys will end up in jail.
[03:13:27.447 --> 03:13:32.855]  If the President wants to find the leakers, do what Lyndon Johnson did rather than Richard Nixon.
[03:13:33.636 --> 03:13:48.360]  Appoint a strong, independent law enforcement man or woman to head the FBI, someone like Ray Kelly, the former New York Police Commissioner, or someone like Judge Jeanine Pirro, and do this legally.
[03:13:48.360 --> 03:13:53.861]  There's awesome investigative powers in the Justice Department and the FBI.
[03:13:53.861 --> 03:13:56.102]  Law has been violated here.
[03:13:56.102 --> 03:14:00.623]  You see, the difference between Watergate and what we see going on with Donald Trump is there's no crime.
[03:14:01.530 --> 03:14:03.652]  Watergate began with a break-in.
[03:14:03.652 --> 03:14:09.218]  No one has yet proved the crime of Russian collusion, if that is even a crime.
[03:14:09.218 --> 03:14:11.340]  Brother Dershowitz says it is not.
[03:14:11.340 --> 03:14:14.524]  So, what we're seeing here is an orchestrated takedown.
[03:14:14.524 --> 03:14:19.109]  And, Owen, you have talked about this ad nauseum, and I salute you for it.
[03:14:19.389 --> 03:14:22.630]  Yeah, honestly, I'm getting sick of it, to be honest.
[03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:28.673]  And I was talking about today, I can't even imagine if you're Donald Trump, a businessman who's worried about the bottom line, you're handcuffed.
[03:14:28.673 --> 03:14:35.115]  You can't stop this witch hunt that's wasting taxpayer dollars, wasting resources, wasting time, because you're handcuffed.
[03:14:35.115 --> 03:14:37.536]  If you do that, they're going to claim you're a Russian agent.
[03:14:37.536 --> 03:14:38.776]  So they handcuffed him there.
[03:14:38.776 --> 03:14:44.438]  But, you know, you just mentioned the new FBI director, who I'm sure is going to be announced sometime soon.
[03:14:44.438 --> 03:14:45.139]  We don't know yet.
[03:14:46.039 --> 03:15:03.089]  It is a very important hiring, I think, for President Trump, because if he gets the right person in there who gets work done and actually wants to drain the swamp, I think that that gives President Trump a lot more operating room to get his agenda going without all of these false narratives being put out.
[03:15:03.089 --> 03:15:08.432]  But I'm just curious, was Joe Lieberman ever really being considered for this job?
[03:15:09.552 --> 03:15:10.813]  Let's hope not.
[03:15:10.813 --> 03:15:12.334]  I mean, look, I'm from Connecticut.
[03:15:12.334 --> 03:15:15.035]  Joe Lieberman is a good friend of mine.
[03:15:15.035 --> 03:15:18.897]  We don't agree on much other than the fact that he was a better U.S.
[03:15:18.897 --> 03:15:23.639]  Senator than Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican.
[03:15:23.639 --> 03:15:27.581]  Better a snake in the grass than an asp in the bosom.
[03:15:27.581 --> 03:15:31.744]  Although that's unfair to Joe Lieberman, who I do agree with on some issues.
[03:15:31.744 --> 03:15:37.807]  But his closeness to Senator John McCain and the fact that he's a rock-ribbed member of the Washington establishment
[03:15:38.667 --> 03:15:43.392]  Uh, the two party system that has brought this country to its knees.
[03:15:43.392 --> 03:15:52.020]  The president needs someone who is not a neocon, not political, someone who will restore confidence.
[03:15:52.020 --> 03:15:55.863]  The New York Times keeps reporting that the morale at the FBI is low.
[03:15:56.761 --> 03:15:59.522]  They cite no sources because it's false.
[03:15:59.522 --> 03:16:04.804]  I've talked to dozens of agents who believe that James Comey politicized the agency.
[03:16:04.804 --> 03:16:09.266]  There was no rhyme or reason to many of his stranger decisions.
[03:16:09.266 --> 03:16:15.609]  He declined to pursue the obvious crimes of the Clintons.
[03:16:15.609 --> 03:16:18.530]  So I agree with you, this will be a pivotal decision.
[03:16:20.171 --> 03:16:30.758]  I should mention, because we're kind of under some kind of cyber attack here, I'm relegated to the cell phone, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the President's trip.
[03:16:30.758 --> 03:16:38.823]  I was very unhappy with the imagery of our President bowing down to get a medal from the Saudi King.
[03:16:38.823 --> 03:16:45.308]  You see, President Trump is a very tall man, and he's broad-shouldered, and, uh, much.
[03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:48.223]  I blame the handlers.
[03:16:48.223 --> 03:16:51.167]  I believe those in charge of stagecraft.
[03:16:51.167 --> 03:16:59.538]  I blame Reince Priebus for putting the president in a position to have a photo that the Muslim world can now use as some kind of propaganda.
[03:17:00.765 --> 03:17:05.347]  Put the king on a riser if necessary.
[03:17:05.347 --> 03:17:07.488]  It's Advance Man 101.
[03:17:07.488 --> 03:17:12.670]  I think that the president's staff has disserved him.
[03:17:12.670 --> 03:17:18.752]  I note to you that he did not bow to the Saudis when he was first introduced to them.
[03:17:19.692 --> 03:17:29.203]  He did not refrain from calling Islamic terrorism what it is in his remarks in front of his Saudi hosts.
[03:17:29.203 --> 03:17:34.369]  And many Americans, myself included, realize that a nuclear Iran
[03:17:35.490 --> 03:17:39.371]  That is a problem for both of our nations.
[03:17:39.371 --> 03:17:50.173]  And while the Saudis do play a double game, and they did finance the attack on America, we will have to bring them to account.
[03:17:50.173 --> 03:17:57.335]  But first, we must take care of the threat of nuclear annihilation from a bunch of lunatics in Iran.
[03:17:58.038 --> 03:18:02.761]  Yeah, and I wish that Trey Gowdy was willing to take the FBI director position.
[03:18:02.761 --> 03:18:10.125]  Apparently he's not for the reasons of the way he just grills other politicians like the way he grilled Brennan last week.
[03:18:10.125 --> 03:18:11.285]  But you know, it's interesting.
[03:18:11.285 --> 03:18:19.830]  I think that the reason why Trump went on this trip was to prove he wasn't an isolationist and that he's willing to take his message abroad, which I think that he did.
[03:18:20.510 --> 03:18:21.931]  Actually get those two things done.
[03:18:21.931 --> 03:18:25.875]  But Dr. Group actually had a question for me and I'd like to hear your opinion on this.
[03:18:25.875 --> 03:18:29.538]  Do the Democrats really think that they can impeach Donald Trump?
[03:18:31.391 --> 03:18:42.596]  Well, I think that there is a subset of the far-left Democrats abetted by their compatriots in the mainstream media.
[03:18:42.596 --> 03:18:55.061]  You know, in the next segment, I expect to talk extensively about the many comparisons of what happened to President Richard Nixon, who was in fact taken down in a similar coup for similar reasons.
[03:18:56.246 --> 03:19:01.990]  Nixon was committed to peace, peace in Vietnam, peace with the Russians, peace with the Chinese.
[03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:10.596]  He cut a strategic deal for the limitation of nuclear warheads, opened the door to China, and the deep state was deeply opposed.
[03:19:10.596 --> 03:19:21.684]  Now Donald Trump stands up for detente and peace with the Russians rather than war over Syria, and we attack his patriotism and scream for impeachment.
[03:19:21.684 --> 03:19:23.545]  We'll get into that.
[03:19:23.545 --> 03:19:24.226]  In the meantime,
[03:19:25.287 --> 03:19:31.897]  Patriots, I just got my fluoride-free Bluetooth paste from InfoWars.
[03:19:31.897 --> 03:19:34.421]  This stuff is unreal.

[03:19:37.786 --> 03:19:39.809]  You can back InfoWars.
[03:19:40.410 --> 03:19:43.311]  Back the fight against censorship.
[03:19:43.311 --> 03:19:52.275]  Help us compete and grab the audience that's falling off of Fox News by the second as they, quote-unquote, move to the center.

[03:24:25.256 --> 03:24:26.777]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:26.777 --> 03:24:31.241]  Owen Troyer here momentarily as we're about to be joined again by Roger Stone.
[03:24:31.241 --> 03:24:32.382]  He's got more breaking news.
[03:24:32.382 --> 03:24:34.384]  But this is just breaking.
[03:24:34.384 --> 03:24:45.072]  Right now, Manchester bomber Salman Abidi's father and brother have been arrested and linked to ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[03:24:45.072 --> 03:24:48.755]  Okay, so a pattern is forming here.
[03:24:48.755 --> 03:24:54.140]  Let's recall that the Manchester bomber traveled to Libya before this happened.
[03:24:55.928 --> 03:25:14.140]  And let's recall that we had multiple warnings from people and he was known to authorities in England that he was indeed behaving strangely and may possibly do something like blow up a bunch of kids at an Ariana Grande concert.
[03:25:14.140 --> 03:25:18.402]  So now his fathers and brothers have been arrested and linked to ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[03:25:18.402 --> 03:25:22.225]  So my question now is, and I'll bring this to Roger Stone,
[03:25:23.587 --> 03:25:27.809]  Are the people in England and Europe finally fed up?
[03:25:27.809 --> 03:25:30.071]  Are they finally willing to do something, Roger?
[03:25:30.071 --> 03:25:36.534]  Are they finally willing to put aside political correctness and do something to protect their homeland?
[03:25:36.534 --> 03:25:39.696]  Well, I think the people are more than ready, Owen.
[03:25:39.696 --> 03:25:41.157]  The question is not the people.
[03:25:41.157 --> 03:25:48.721]  The question is the elitist global leadership, globalist leadership of a number of those nations.
[03:25:48.721 --> 03:25:53.144]  I had dinner last night with Tony Fabrizio, probably the
[03:25:53.724 --> 03:26:04.215]  For most Republican pollster in the country, he recently returned from France where he was working with Madame Le Pen.
[03:26:04.215 --> 03:26:11.183]  And the mainstream media there, like here, seeks to suppress popular sentiment.
[03:26:11.183 --> 03:26:14.546]  But I think in Germany, in France, in Belgium,
[03:26:15.467 --> 03:26:33.386]  The people are tired of swarms of Arabic youths pillaging, raping, assaulting, bombing, stealing, defecating in public fountains, destroying public property, turning over and burning police cars, taking taxpayer dollars.
[03:26:34.907 --> 03:26:40.290]  And it is what is driving the reform across the country.
[03:26:40.290 --> 03:26:42.191]  It is what elected Donald Trump.
[03:26:42.191 --> 03:26:46.813]  It is what scored in the referendum in Italy not long ago.
[03:26:46.813 --> 03:26:50.154]  It is what gave us Brexit.
[03:26:50.154 --> 03:26:57.138]  It would have won France, but for problems that I think relate to the fact that
[03:26:58.571 --> 03:27:02.513]  The majority of French voters disagreed with the candidate who won.
[03:27:02.513 --> 03:27:14.080]  The majority of French voters, by large margins, agreed with Le Pen, but she was stigmatized and the connection to her father, who she is not,
[03:27:15.031 --> 03:27:24.915]  But who retains very high negatives, I think, cost us that race, cost the forces of freedom that race.
[03:27:24.915 --> 03:27:27.036]  I pray for the French people.
[03:27:27.036 --> 03:27:36.881]  That is such an excellent point, Roger, and it can be proven because, look, we see people do this on the streets of America, you walk up to a Trump hater or a liberal,
[03:27:37.850 --> 03:27:48.415]  And you tell them all of Trump's policies, but you just say them, you know, kind of in passing or just in general or say, hey, these are Clinton's policies, but you say Trump's policies, they agree with all of them.
[03:27:49.568 --> 03:27:51.109]  But it's the stigmatism, Roger!
[03:27:51.109 --> 03:27:55.450]  It's the exact same phenomena that we have seen.
[03:27:55.450 --> 03:28:03.513]  Well, Owen, I want to talk about what I think is developing as the most interesting congressional race, perhaps in the country.
[03:28:03.513 --> 03:28:09.055]  Deborah Wasserman Schultz, right here in Florida, caught red-handed.
[03:28:09.975 --> 03:28:14.556]  Stealing the Democratic nomination from Bernie Sanders.
[03:28:14.556 --> 03:28:19.158]  Busted by the people at WikiLeaks, the journalists at WikiLeaks.
[03:28:19.158 --> 03:28:19.638]  Fired.
[03:28:19.638 --> 03:28:21.638]  Published this sordid tale.
[03:28:21.638 --> 03:28:36.583]  Now, four years ago, Tim Canova, a Bernie Sanders supporter, challenged her in the Democratic primary and he raised a significant amount from the grassroots to finish with a very strong 43%.
[03:28:39.119 --> 03:28:54.329]  In the end Wasserman Schultz was able to win because she held on to the so-called condo commandos who deliver a very large and essentially bossed senior citizen vote of older voters.
[03:28:54.329 --> 03:29:03.615]  She won among Jewish voters, Catholic Democrats, while her opponent won among progressives, liberals, people of color.
[03:29:03.615 --> 03:29:06.978]  Mr. Canova has indicated that he will have a rematch.
[03:29:07.987 --> 03:29:20.258]  Now, Carla Spaulding, a Haitian, a registered nurse, a woman of great character has emerged to seek the Republican nomination in this district.
[03:29:21.390 --> 03:29:32.040]  And, on June 10th, she headlines a rally outside the local affiliate, Channel 10.
[03:29:32.040 --> 03:29:34.662]  A non-censorship rally.
[03:29:34.662 --> 03:29:36.964]  So, this is a race to watch.
[03:29:36.964 --> 03:29:46.433]  We're going to be following it very closely here at InfoWars, because Jebra Wasserman Schultz deserves the challenge she's about to get.
[03:29:49.252 --> 03:29:52.279]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.279 --> 03:29:55.888]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.187 --> 03:30:10.910]  Fox News has a new television host, and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories about Seth Rich.
[03:30:10.910 --> 03:30:17.792]  Let the Rich family get the closure that they need properly, and not with your crazy conspiracy theories on the internet.
[03:30:17.792 --> 03:30:18.992]  Save them for Bigfoot.
[03:30:18.992 --> 03:30:22.593]  In the post-Roger Ailes era of the Fox News Network,
[03:30:22.893 --> 03:30:28.940]  Liberal Democrat host Julie Roginsky went after Seth Rich, conspiracy theorist.
[03:30:28.940 --> 03:30:31.923]  Listen, WikiLeaks was in collaboration with the Russians.
[03:30:31.923 --> 03:30:32.544]  How do we know this?
[03:30:32.544 --> 03:30:37.470]  Because the entire intelligence community said that the Russians were the ones that hacked into these emails.
[03:30:37.790 --> 03:30:46.575]  Meanwhile, evidence continues to surface that Seth Rich did, in fact, have contact with WikiLeaks before he was murdered.
[03:30:46.575 --> 03:30:54.899]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clinton crime family.
[03:30:54.899 --> 03:30:58.721]  I'm Darren McBreen, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:30:58.721 --> 03:31:04.684]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[03:31:04.684 --> 03:31:05.945]  David in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:31:06.914 --> 03:31:07.374]  Great!
[03:31:07.374 --> 03:31:08.495]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:31:08.495 --> 03:31:13.017]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say, they're amazing.
[03:31:13.017 --> 03:31:22.282]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it, because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:31:22.282 --> 03:31:22.882]  Wow, thank you.
[03:31:22.882 --> 03:31:25.443]  You're on top of the list that makes it all possible.
[03:31:25.443 --> 03:31:27.084]  Which Nutra-Certical does he like best?
[03:31:27.324 --> 03:31:30.805]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:31:30.805 --> 03:31:31.205]  That's amazing.
[03:31:31.205 --> 03:31:32.086]  That's really incredible.
[03:31:32.086 --> 03:31:35.147]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:31:35.147 --> 03:31:36.487]  Like, I haven't felt sweet.
[03:31:36.487 --> 03:31:38.168]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:31:38.168 --> 03:31:39.409]  And I love you guys.
[03:31:39.409 --> 03:31:41.549]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[03:31:41.549 --> 03:31:48.412]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:31:48.412 --> 03:31:49.452]  You will love it.
[03:31:49.452 --> 03:31:49.952]  I'm telling you.
[03:31:49.952 --> 03:31:51.273]  I've never bought a bad product.
[03:31:51.593 --> 03:31:56.017]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:56.017 --> 03:32:00.481]  It's the win-win Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:00.481 --> 03:32:14.833]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[03:32:14.833 --> 03:32:17.155]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[03:32:17.635 --> 03:32:21.598]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[03:32:21.598 --> 03:32:33.947]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[03:32:33.947 --> 03:32:38.791]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at InfoWareStore.com.

[03:33:04.725 --> 03:33:09.086]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:33:09.086 --> 03:33:13.587]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:13.587 --> 03:33:21.409]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:21.409 --> 03:33:30.131]  Well, as Cary Grant might say, Julie, Julie, Julie Roginsky.
[03:33:30.131 --> 03:33:30.471]  Wrong.
[03:33:31.499 --> 03:33:37.302]  You see, we do respect Seth Rich's parents' requests for privacy.
[03:33:37.302 --> 03:33:39.683]  Privacy is very important.
[03:33:39.683 --> 03:33:43.486]  But truth is more important.
[03:33:43.486 --> 03:33:50.569]  Now, I may say several things about the Seth Rich matter that need to be said.
[03:33:50.569 --> 03:33:56.633]  Many of you know the topic of Seth Rich has turned radioactive almost overnight.
[03:33:57.659 --> 03:34:11.392]  The amount of energy being spended by the left to bury this issue and to end any questions and to try to chop off the legs of anyone associated with it is obvious.
[03:34:11.392 --> 03:34:16.016]  Suddenly, the topic is supposed to be off limits.
[03:34:16.016 --> 03:34:20.840]  Now, there is a good bit of information out here that is disinformation.
[03:34:23.468 --> 03:34:30.752]  Email of John Podesta, where he is quoted as saying, let's make an example of the leaker.
[03:34:30.752 --> 03:34:44.340]  And relating that to Seth Rich is a trap, in my opinion, because that email was addressed at a much different time to Joel Benson and Robby Mook back in February of 2015.
[03:34:48.662 --> 03:34:58.526]  It had to do with potential members of the Hillary campaign in the finance department who were quoted in the press.
[03:34:58.526 --> 03:35:06.230]  This, I think, was used to discredit certain critics on the Seth Rich question.
[03:35:07.732 --> 03:35:14.678]  I don't base my suspicions about Seth Rich on this email.
[03:35:14.678 --> 03:35:17.280]  The important thing to remember is this.
[03:35:17.280 --> 03:35:20.862]  Mr. Rich headed a division of the DNC.
[03:35:20.862 --> 03:35:25.006]  He was not a low-level IT employee.
[03:35:25.794 --> 03:35:37.721]  He was in charge of the division from which documents very clearly were purloined or hacked or turned over and showed up on WikiLeaks.
[03:35:37.721 --> 03:35:46.926]  None of the accuracy or the authenticity of those documents has been challenged by the mainstream media.
[03:35:47.901 --> 03:36:02.244]  When we learn that the DC Metropolitan Police did not question the bartender or any of the employees in the establishment where Mr. Rich was last seen, when we learn that they did not
[03:36:03.643 --> 03:36:07.586]  Let's request the security camera footage.
[03:36:07.586 --> 03:36:17.813]  When we learn that a DNC crisis manager and fixer is now, I believe, still working for the rich family.
[03:36:17.813 --> 03:36:31.803]  When the Washington Post, the official house organ of the Central Intelligence Agency, the voice of the two-party duopoly of neocons that have taken this country down the crapper.
[03:36:32.563 --> 03:36:39.668]  Tells us that we can't question what happened out of respect for the family's privacy.
[03:36:39.668 --> 03:36:51.456]  Well, as I said earlier, as much as I have sympathy for anyone over the loss of their son, the truth and where it leads is a key question.
[03:36:52.316 --> 03:37:06.547]  Mr. Bauman, who is representing the parents, according to some, is an unwanted interloper, while others believe that he is assigned to handle the rich family.
[03:37:06.547 --> 03:37:17.516]  Bauman is a professional Democratic crisis public relations consultant in Washington, D.C., and has been a frequent critic of Donald Trump.
[03:37:17.516 --> 03:37:18.277]  Well, well.
[03:37:19.938 --> 03:37:30.519]  It is interesting that the DNC has taken little public action in trying to track down Mr. Rich's killer, but now, suddenly, they're committing to stopping and
[03:37:31.499 --> 03:37:38.264]  Dedicating resources to the cover-up and attempts to make this story go away.
[03:37:38.264 --> 03:37:55.835]  And while calls from Seth's family for respect should be heeded, it is also safe to say that his family above all should want to know what happened on that fateful night when he was murdered, taking three in the back.
[03:37:55.835 --> 03:38:01.359]  It is only natural for his family to want to know what really happened.
[03:38:03.281 --> 03:38:21.998]  We are in a situation in which Kim Dotcom put forward a Nothingburger, now a founder of Mega Uploads, a notorious hacker, with a website famous for distributing pirated versions of copyright works.
[03:38:22.975 --> 03:38:39.131]  In 2012, the federal government, in tandem with several other agencies of international law enforcement, raided Mr. Dotcom in New Zealand, where he had been living, arrested him, and seized all of his assets.
[03:38:40.174 --> 03:38:50.320]  Since then, Kim Dotcom has been fighting extradition to the U.S., and just this past February, he lost his last New Zealand appeal.
[03:38:50.320 --> 03:38:54.082]  He's now being processed for extradition.
[03:38:54.082 --> 03:39:03.047]  It is entirely possible that Kim did not do himself any favors by injecting himself into the Seth Rich narrative and debate.
[03:39:04.167 --> 03:39:20.399]  Sadly, he's offered no new revelations, backed by substantial proof last week, and over the weekend, he sadly revealed he has nothing of substance to add to the vital search for who murdered Sethridge.
[03:39:21.778 --> 03:39:41.697]  Except for some secret information that he now says he will only provide to the FBI Director, former FBI Director, new Special Counsel, Mr. Mueller, in exchange for immunity and safe passage from New Zealand to the USA and back.
[03:39:43.248 --> 03:39:57.537]  I fear that this was a ploy to get another chance at fighting his case here in the United States, while a free man living the high life and not in a federal prison cell.
[03:39:57.537 --> 03:40:04.401]  I was sorry to see Sean Hannity and others in the alternative
[03:40:05.757 --> 03:40:25.937]  Media community buy into what was most likely a ploy which had the net effect of distracting the American people from the inexorable need to know whether Seth Rich was assassinated for political reasons.
[03:40:27.099 --> 03:40:48.059]  The British diplomat Craig Murray, a man of impeccable integrity and excellent reputation, says that he was in touch with Rich and that Rich passed to him certain documents in a parking lot near American University in Washington, D.C.
[03:40:49.825 --> 03:41:01.369]  It is also notable that Mr. Rich had, without any question, access to the material in question.
[03:41:01.369 --> 03:41:06.031]  Donald Trump must tell his FBI director.
[03:41:07.071 --> 03:41:36.244]  A person who should be of non-political background, a law enforcement person, a man or a woman who will put politics aside and get behind the effort to take this investigation from the Metropolitan Police of the District of Columbia and conduct it in a professional manner in which no stone is left unturned.
[03:41:37.236 --> 03:41:43.501]  We have seen the private investigator initially hired by the Rich family.
[03:41:43.501 --> 03:41:47.344]  He is an African-American of excellent reputation.
[03:41:47.344 --> 03:41:53.528]  His contacts within the DC Metropolitan Police are first-rate.
[03:41:53.528 --> 03:42:04.297]  He is correct in my view that Rich's computer, his PC, contained evidence that he was in touch with WikiLeaks.
[03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:12.266]  Fox is a conundrum of boiling internal politics.
[03:42:12.266 --> 03:42:18.372]  You see, the Murdoch sons would like Fox to become the Sky Channel.
[03:42:18.372 --> 03:42:29.822]  And thus, Fox backed off what I believe is indeed an accurate early report that some 40,000 documents went from Mr. Rich to WikiLeaks.
[03:42:30.948 --> 03:42:34.089]  I believe Sean Hannity knows it too.
[03:42:34.089 --> 03:42:45.972]  And I'm disappointed that Fox has undercut one of their leading conservative commentators and a staunch supporter of President Trump.
[03:42:45.972 --> 03:42:55.335]  Indeed, we are only beginning the question of Mr. Rich and who murdered him and why.
[03:42:55.335 --> 03:42:57.696]  I'd like to know.
[03:42:57.696 --> 03:42:58.096]  Wouldn't you?
[03:43:00.313 --> 03:43:02.956]  Meanwhile, the President is abroad.
[03:43:02.956 --> 03:43:13.506]  Now, a nine-day trip, I think, is another example of poor staff work by the people around the President.
[03:43:13.506 --> 03:43:20.173]  Just the same, the stagecraft is good, and the President is having a most successful trip.
[03:43:21.016 --> 03:43:28.944]  When he returns, he will be confronted again with the partisanship at a fever pitch.
[03:43:28.944 --> 03:43:39.816]  And many on the both sides of the aisle seeking to get their mugs on TV with false accusations of treason and collusion with the Russians.
[03:43:40.799 --> 03:43:44.701]  This past week, I complied with a U.S.
[03:43:44.701 --> 03:43:49.262]  Senate Intelligence Committee request for documents.
[03:43:49.262 --> 03:43:58.126]  I turned over all documents regarding a very specific issue area pertaining to Russia.
[03:43:58.126 --> 03:44:05.509]  I have it on good authority that Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman for Donald Trump, did the same.
[03:44:06.329 --> 03:44:15.094]  And I reiterate my desire to testify in public before the Senate or the House committee.
[03:44:15.094 --> 03:44:29.601]  See, it's time for the Feinsteins, the Frankens, the Warners, and on the House side, the Schiffs, the Swalwells, the Spires, to put up or shut up.
[03:44:29.601 --> 03:44:33.443]  Don't accuse Paul Manafort or Roger Stone of treason.
[03:44:34.562 --> 03:44:44.488]  We may be tough and sharp-elbowed partisan political operatives, but we are not traitors to the United States.
[03:44:44.488 --> 03:44:55.996]  And the insinuation that we are rankles against your constant phony claim for civility in politics.
[03:44:55.996 --> 03:44:58.898]  And it will not be tolerated.
[03:44:58.898 --> 03:45:02.220]  Now, General Flynn may choose to plead the fifth.
[03:45:03.339 --> 03:45:08.103]  That is not, in our system, necessarily proof of guilt.
[03:45:08.103 --> 03:45:14.729]  And the General's legal strategy, and his public relations strategy, a bit of a mystery to me, I must say.
[03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:16.971]  Is up to him.
[03:45:16.971 --> 03:45:27.861]  But as for me, I want to address the fake question of whether I knew about John Podesta's emails being hacked in advance.
[03:45:27.861 --> 03:45:35.288]  A lie proven to be a lie by factcheck.org, hardly a right-wing organization.
[03:45:36.448 --> 03:45:52.401]  And I want to dismiss the question of whether I had specific advanced knowledge of the content of the incredible information that WikiLeaks dumped on the American people, indeed the world, in October.
[03:45:52.401 --> 03:46:04.270]  The idea that I colluded with Assange, the idea that Assange is a Russian asset, the idea that Guccifer 2.0 works for the Russians is
[03:46:05.180 --> 03:46:10.721]  Intelligence agency, Obama appointee, poppycock.
[03:46:10.721 --> 03:46:12.302]  Nonsense.
[03:46:12.302 --> 03:46:21.104]  I say again, when the agencies use the word assessment, let your BS detector go up.
[03:46:21.104 --> 03:46:23.764]  That means they know nothing.
[03:46:23.764 --> 03:46:30.206]  That means they are telling you what fits their narrative, not necessarily the truth.
[03:46:31.147 --> 03:46:36.955]  And I applaud the appointment of a special prosecutor.
[03:46:36.955 --> 03:46:48.870]  I have grave reservations about Mr. Mueller and his wife, a high-powered attorney, who have obvious connections to the Clintons and other power players in this drama.
[03:46:49.858 --> 03:46:56.160]  I am hopeful Mr. Mueller can run an impartial investigation.
[03:46:56.160 --> 03:47:07.244]  He did, after all, tell George W. Bush that his metadata collection program violated the U.S.
[03:47:07.244 --> 03:47:08.184]  Constitution.
[03:47:09.540 --> 03:47:21.352]  We are at a crossroads where the parallels between former President Richard Nixon and Donald Trump are indeed manifest.
[03:47:21.352 --> 03:47:30.460]  You see, Nixon ended the war in Vietnam, he opened the door to China, he reached a strategic arms limitation agreement with the Soviets.
[03:47:31.409 --> 03:47:37.792]  And we now know that the Watergate burglary team was infiltrated by the CIA.
[03:47:37.792 --> 03:47:52.319]  We know that the judge in the Watergate burglars case, John Sirica, was meeting ex-partite with Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski.
[03:47:53.138 --> 03:48:16.132]  We know that the Washington Post was well aware of a complex Pentagon spying operation inside the Nixon White House, where documents were being purloined from National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and the President, copied and sent to Admiral Thomas Moore, the head of the Joint Chiefs, in violation of law.
[03:48:17.262 --> 03:48:24.628]  We know that Richard Nixon was taken down because he was a peacemaker.
[03:48:24.628 --> 03:48:29.072]  Now, yes, he gave them a sword, there is no question.
[03:48:29.072 --> 03:48:42.623]  But Donald Trump, who has roused the passions of the silent majority and the forgotten Americans like no president since Richard Nixon, is now under assault from the same deep state sources.
[03:48:43.283 --> 03:48:52.290]  The FBI, the CIA, the Washington Post, and the political intelligentsia manufacturing lies.
[03:48:52.290 --> 03:49:03.480]  The President disclosed classified information to the Russians about ISIS using laptops for bombs and getting them on planes?
[03:49:03.480 --> 03:49:06.883]  I believe that appeared in a hundred newspapers across America.
[03:49:07.816 --> 03:49:12.260]  That story is a fabrication that is meant to discredit the President.
[03:49:12.260 --> 03:49:15.382]  And then there's the New York Times.
[03:49:15.382 --> 03:49:21.728]  All the news that's fit to print, embellished with a left-wing tint.
[03:49:21.728 --> 03:49:27.192]  Mr. Comey has a memo saying the President tried to impede his investigation?
[03:49:27.192 --> 03:49:30.495]  Who has seen such memo?
[03:49:30.495 --> 03:49:35.839]  Oh, a person told a reporter on the phone and read from it.
[03:49:35.839 --> 03:49:36.520]  Bush-wah!
[03:49:37.608 --> 03:49:39.249]  That's journalism?
[03:49:39.249 --> 03:49:51.136]  No, that's a hit piece by the New York Times to take down and destabilize Donald Trump because he challenges the globalists and the New World Order.
[03:49:52.057 --> 03:49:53.497]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:49:53.497 --> 03:49:57.579]  You're at the right place at InfoWars.com.

[03:50:59.921 --> 03:51:03.005]  Extendovite is more than just a heart tonic.
[03:51:03.005 --> 03:51:05.067]  Do you have any of these symptoms?
[03:51:05.067 --> 03:51:06.889]  Night cramps in the hands and feet.
[03:51:06.889 --> 03:51:09.112]  Your arms and legs often go to sleep.
[03:51:09.112 --> 03:51:11.815]  On short walks, do your legs get aches and pains?
[03:51:11.815 --> 03:51:13.958]  Is your memory worse than it used to be?
[03:51:13.958 --> 03:51:15.820]  Ankles that swell late in the day.
[03:51:15.820 --> 03:51:17.562]  Has your blood pressure increased lately?
[03:51:17.842 --> 03:51:24.426]  If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning signs of arterial blockages.
[03:51:24.426 --> 03:51:27.848]  Your body is saying that it is time to take Xtendivite.
[03:51:27.848 --> 03:51:30.150]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[03:51:30.150 --> 03:51:33.472]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.
[03:51:33.472 --> 03:51:35.393]  Get your Xtendivite today!

[03:51:59.547 --> 03:52:07.953]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:52:07.953 --> 03:52:20.821]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslive.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[03:52:20.821 --> 03:52:21.361]  Caveman.
[03:52:21.661 --> 03:52:26.705]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[03:52:26.705 --> 03:52:29.127]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[03:52:29.127 --> 03:52:32.269]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:52:32.269 --> 03:52:34.531]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking.
[03:52:34.531 --> 03:52:37.373]  But you used the bones for strength.
[03:52:37.373 --> 03:52:42.717]  From the outside structure full of minerals and ketofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[03:52:42.717 --> 03:52:45.079]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[03:52:45.479 --> 03:52:53.382]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[03:52:53.382 --> 03:52:58.024]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.

[03:53:56.850 --> 03:53:57.630]  Effective.
[03:53:57.630 --> 03:54:04.453]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:54:04.453 --> 03:54:07.155]  Don't want no silence.
[03:54:14.969 --> 03:54:21.792]  And that is your Genuine Roots music, the blues of the Delta.
[03:54:21.792 --> 03:54:24.674]  Great stuff here at Infowars.com.
[03:54:24.674 --> 03:54:38.520]  Again, I want to let patriots and freedom lovers across South Florida know about the rally, which is June 10th here in Fort Lauderdale.
[03:54:39.020 --> 03:54:43.123]  We have the information we're going to put up on screen here for you for a moment.
[03:54:43.123 --> 03:55:01.715]  Now, the purpose of this rally is to demonstrate against the efforts by the tech left to censor patriotic Americans and alternative media outlets which are being
[03:55:02.765 --> 03:55:07.887]  Today are all universally under assault.
[03:55:07.887 --> 03:55:18.672]  We are seeing the tech left monkeying with the algorithms of InfoWars and Breitbart and the Stone Cold Truth.com and StoneZone.com.
[03:55:19.292 --> 03:55:36.816]  The liberal fascists are orchestrating an attack on conservative leaders like Alex Jones and Bill O'Reilly and others in an attempt to censor us, in an attempt to silence us.
[03:55:36.816 --> 03:55:42.398]  You see, they can't argue on the merits, so they drop back to Stalinistic
[03:55:43.178 --> 03:55:43.919]  I don't know.
[03:55:59.398 --> 03:56:03.121]  That I will be headed to Austin.
[03:56:03.121 --> 03:56:15.209]  But before I go, on the 29th, I headline a online Skype appearance for John F. Kennedy's 100th birthday.
[03:56:15.209 --> 03:56:18.591]  That's this Memorial Day, starting at 9 a.m.
[03:56:18.591 --> 03:56:20.092]  Pacific Time.
[03:56:20.092 --> 03:56:23.735]  And we have an incredible all-star lineup of
[03:56:24.415 --> 03:56:30.297]  Alternative researchers and other experts on the Kennedy assassination.
[03:56:30.297 --> 03:56:35.800]  The last deep state takedown of a president.
[03:56:35.800 --> 03:56:39.221]  The first one really, before Richard Nixon.
[03:56:39.221 --> 03:56:45.744]  And exactly what, in a different form, the critics of Donald Trump may have in mind.
[03:56:45.744 --> 03:56:51.086]  I pray for the president's safety and that of his family every day.
[03:56:51.966 --> 03:56:54.787]  And you should join me in that.
[03:56:54.787 --> 03:57:08.649]  Again, I'd like to pull up the details for the June 10th rally, if we may, because it's important to have a turnout of patriots.
[03:57:08.649 --> 03:57:16.291]  It is at the important juncture in the fight for freedom.
[03:57:18.491 --> 03:57:29.816]  As I indicated, Carla Spaulding, the dynamic Republican candidate for Congress here against Deborah Wasserman Schultz, will speak.
[03:57:29.816 --> 03:57:32.237]  We will put this up online.
[03:57:32.237 --> 03:57:39.620]  We seem to be having a technical issue regarding these terrific details, but join us
[03:57:40.500 --> 03:57:42.681]  June 10th, mark it on your calendar.
[03:57:42.681 --> 03:58:09.294]  You can go to StoneColdTruths.com to get the details of where and when you must mask to help us mount a voice against censorship, against the tech left, against twisted little freaks like David Brock who use their bots to try to silence us in the fight for freedom and a free press, the First Amendment.
[03:58:09.754 --> 03:58:12.115]  Make no mistake about it, folks.
[03:58:12.115 --> 03:58:27.741]  When Infowars and Breitbart and the Stone Cold Truth and Daily Caller are under siege, it is a fight to strangle the movement that elected Donald Trump and can make America great again.
[03:58:27.741 --> 03:58:36.065]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones, and let me say, fight the power.
[03:58:42.375 --> 03:58:46.372]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
