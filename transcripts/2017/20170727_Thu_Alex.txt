[00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:17.064]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:30.009]  I'm David Knight and we have a lot of breaking news today and Alex is going to be joining us later in the show.
[00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:37.990]  Just to give you an overview of what's happening, we're going to take a look at the reaction from the GOP to Trump's tran ban.
[00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.332]  And we're going to take a look at it from a standpoint of what does it really take to be in the military?
[00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:47.373]  What is happening with the health of veterans?
[00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:52.339]  We're going to take a look at something that hasn't gotten any traction at all for over a year.
[00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.261]  We've had a documentary that's been circulating around.
[00:00:54.302 --> 00:00:56.104]  We've reported here at Infowars.com.
[00:00:56.164 --> 00:01:01.711]  It's talking about the effect of mandated experimental vaccines on the military.
[00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:03.784]  Nobody's talking about that.
[00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:09.708]  Meanwhile, we get a bill that would offer medical marijuana to veterans in states where it is legal.
[00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:15.412]  That got shut down very quickly by the GOP, so they're not really concerned about the military's health.
[00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:18.774]  But we also have a mission here, and Trump was absolutely right.
[00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:23.357]  It's not only a monetary issue, but it is also a mission issue.
[00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:30.162]  So we're going to take a look at the reaction of the GOP, and I think it's kind of interesting that as Trump is shutting this down,
[00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:36.985]  On the trans side, and I believe, as I think the majority of Americans do, that this is really a mental issue.
[00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:39.686]  It's a personality issue that people need to deal with.
[00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:42.287]  They don't need to come into the military with that kind of baggage.
[00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:46.549]  We've got a mission to accomplish in the military and we don't need to have that kind of baggage.
[00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.431]  Meanwhile, they're coming after Trump and saying he's nuts!
[00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:57.635]  So you got Obama with a brand new rule, tries to fill the military with corporate clingers who need to be sectioned eight out of the military.
[00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:00.935]  But then it's Trump who is crazy.
[00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:11.858]  And so now they've got one of the psychiatric associations saying we need to ignore this ethical rule that was put in when Barry Goldwater was attacked politically when they accused him wrongfully.
[00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:17.339]  And he won a suit against the individuals saying you can't diagnose somebody from watching them on television.
[00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.901]  These are the kind of professionals we've got to look at here.
[00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:25.086]  Meanwhile, we have Foxconn moving to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin.
[00:02:25.527 --> 00:02:28.450]  They will employ up to 13,000 people.
[00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.893]  They're going to be making screens for iPhones, among other things.
[00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:32.874]  So that's a big win there.
[00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:36.197]  A big problem that is coming down the pike.
[00:02:37.228 --> 00:02:43.892]  As Britain has now joined France to say they're going to ban all internal combustion cars and vans and vehicles by 2040.
[00:02:44.252 --> 00:02:50.315]  You're just going to be riding around in little remote-controlled, battery-operated boxes.
[00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:51.496]  And who's going to have the remote?
[00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:52.616]  The government.
[00:02:52.957 --> 00:02:55.198]  They're going to follow everywhere that you go.
[00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:57.640]  They're going to control everywhere that you go.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.921]  That's the real issue, folks.
[00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:04.566]  It isn't so much what the engine is, as it is who controls the engine.
[00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:06.227]  And that's one of the reasons that they want that.
[00:03:06.307 --> 00:03:09.930]  It's a very, very deep issue that we're going to get into as well.
[00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.876]  We've got Jamie Johnson, a performer who was scheduled to do a performance at the House of Blues.
[00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:20.499]  I thought it was kind of interesting that they would not allow concealed carry.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.682]  And he said, well, then I'm not going to play your concert.
[00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:26.364]  And they wouldn't give up on the rule, and neither would he.
[00:03:26.804 --> 00:03:32.188]  We don't want to give up, folks, on our fundamental rights and have them taken away.
[00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:33.049]  And so good for him.
[00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.230]  I don't know, Jamie Johnson, but...
[00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:39.415]  I don't know his music, but I want to give him a shout out for doing the right thing.
[00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:53.574]  Meanwhile, Charlie Gard, after the UK has delayed and delayed and delayed, and now they've said there's no hope for the 11-month-old baby who has a very rare medical condition, and the hospitals who've looked at this, the Vatican Hospital, have said, well, if
[00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:58.176]  He'd been released earlier out of the UK if they would have allowed him.
[00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:01.137]  They kept him prisoner there and we've talked about this before.
[00:04:01.417 --> 00:04:03.537]  It really goes down to authority, doesn't it?
[00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:08.739]  In the same way what we're just talking about with your movement and cars and your transportation.
[00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.399]  They want to control everything and they want to take the place of the parents.
[00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.080]  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
[00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:43.299]  is a convention that has been ratified by every country in the world except for the United States that's why it's important for us to understand what happened to Charlie Gard so we make sure that never gets ratified here so that the parents can express an opinion but the decisions will be made by others and so now they're deciding that he's not going to be allowed to go home even though the parents have offered to pay for it they would like to let their child die with them at home they said no and we're going to take a look at the Bundy standoff I was there
[00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.260]  And the first person has been sentenced to 68 years.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.302]  I'm going to tell you what an amazing miscarriage of justice and how they are rigging the judicial situation there.
[00:04:56.042 --> 00:05:03.044]  Unbelievable, even for me, and I'm very... It's hard to tell, to show me something that makes me think that the government is...
[00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:13.071]  We need funding.
[00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:14.178]  The enemy's after us.
[00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:14.842]  We got rape.
[00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:22.821]  See, to fund ourselves, I sell really great products at very affordable prices, so you like them, and you use them, and you want to order them more.
[00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:24.683]  See, I don't think like a globalist.
[00:05:24.763 --> 00:05:28.005]  I treat you how I want to be treated, and you treat me like that, and I love you.
[00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:28.666]  You're awesome.
[00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:39.614]  It is such a pleasure that they want to destroy us, and they can't because you support us, and you pray for us, and you spread the articles, and you buy the products, and you just absolutely are committed.
[00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:41.315]  Oh, you're awesome.
[00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:45.579]  It's just unbelievable how we rub it in their faces and how our will's stronger than theirs.
[00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:58.632]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had to end the super male vitality, super female vitality, the X2 and the brain force because...
[00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:00.823]  They're selling out.
[00:06:01.223 --> 00:06:05.205]  And I don't like to just do discounts so good that we're sold out for a month or two before more comes in.
[00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:06.345]  There's a limited supply left.

[00:07:09.955 --> 00:07:11.836]  They were like $1,000 a few years ago.
[00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:12.577]  They're all getting cheaper.
[00:07:12.837 --> 00:07:14.318]  There's a miniaturization of technology.
[00:07:14.618 --> 00:07:16.179]  But $200 is a great deal.

[00:07:58.465 --> 00:07:58.785]  Yes!
[00:08:03.405 --> 00:08:03.905]  Emotion.
[00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:05.266]  You found it.
[00:08:05.306 --> 00:08:07.367]  The tip of the sphere.
[00:08:07.567 --> 00:08:10.688]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[00:08:28.183 --> 00:08:35.308]  You planned this, Jessica?
[00:09:01.511 --> 00:09:06.394]  We're good.
[00:09:41.286 --> 00:09:46.991]  Alright, and that was Hugh Bannister, and he has played all the instruments and edited the video on our contest.
[00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:59.783]  This is a $20,000 prize for a cover song, and this is our own version, our audience's version, of the cover song that they used from Super Deluxe, making fun of Alex, and of course Alex
[00:10:00.464 --> 00:10:05.549]  Went back and did an edited version, which showed how they had twisted what he had had to say.
[00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:08.992]  And of course, that's one of Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals, right?
[00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:15.738]  You take somebody's words, you twist them, you ridicule them, because it's the most effective way to destroy somebody.
[00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:18.999]  As Saul Alinsky said, you can't really respond to it.
[00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.279]  Well, we found a way to respond to it.
[00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:23.720]  We come back with our own version of that and our audience.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.841]  And so that's a metal cover of the John Ivers song composition.
[00:10:28.221 --> 00:10:30.602]  And we're going to have some more of those coming up in the show for you.
[00:10:30.622 --> 00:10:35.763]  I want to cover several different articles here because there's a lot of things that are coming out.
[00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:38.204]  We've got Russian sanctions that are coming in again.
[00:10:38.264 --> 00:10:38.704]  And of course,
[00:10:39.798 --> 00:10:46.467]  I know as soon as you hear Russia, your mind starts to shut down, if you're like me, because I am overloading on Russia.
[00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:48.409]  But let's understand what's happening with this.
[00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:50.071]  I talked about this on the Nightly News the other night.
[00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:53.956]  They're laying the foundation for a worldwide trade war.
[00:10:54.878 --> 00:11:02.805]  We had Obama and Hillary Clinton in the Ukraine, in Syria, with regime change, laying the foundation for a new Cold War.
[00:11:02.845 --> 00:11:03.486]  And they got that.
[00:11:04.407 --> 00:11:06.449]  And now it seems like they're even pushing even farther.
[00:11:06.489 --> 00:11:09.051]  They would like to get a hot war going between the U.S.
[00:11:09.131 --> 00:11:09.492]  and Russia.
[00:11:10.472 --> 00:11:15.777]  But they're also now moving towards sanctions, which are a prelude to a hot war.
[00:11:16.438 --> 00:11:21.803]  And you have to understand that what they did to get the Republicans to come along, they passed this almost unanimously.
[00:11:22.163 --> 00:11:29.150]  It's 419 to 3 to do sanctions and to tie President Trump's hands to say, you're not going to be allowed to remove any of these sanctions.
[00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.933]  And so what they did was their Democrats came in and said, we want sanctions against Russia.
[00:11:32.953 --> 00:11:34.034]  No surprise.
[00:11:35.155 --> 00:11:40.858]  And they said, and by the way, we can put sanctions on Iran and on North Korea for you Republicans.
[00:11:40.918 --> 00:11:41.719]  And so that's great.
[00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.600]  We'll just put trade sanctions on everybody.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.040]  But then guess what?
[00:11:45.641 --> 00:11:51.804]  The Russian sanctions are going to impact natural gas sales to Europe.
[00:11:52.684 --> 00:11:53.705]  Europe doesn't like that.
[00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:55.005]  And so the EU let
[00:11:56.972 --> 00:12:03.480]  ...leak a memo saying that within days they're going to enact trade sanctions against the US, so we're going to have everybody shutting down trade.
[00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:11.910]  Remember when the establishment neocon globalists were telling us that Donald Trump was going to start a worldwide trade war?
[00:12:12.391 --> 00:12:14.613]  That Donald Trump was going to be a protectionist?
[00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:16.056]  And now who is it?
[00:12:16.556 --> 00:12:26.720]  It's the establishment Republicans, the establishment Democrats, the military-industrial complex, the forever war people, who are pushing for a worldwide trade war.
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.221]  That's the people who are doing this.
[00:12:29.721 --> 00:12:36.483]  And you have to understand when we go back and look at what's going on with Syria, it's a reminder, when we look at this natural gas pipeline,
[00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:47.058]  There were memos coming out and actually some statements from German ministers saying, we will determine what the energy policy of Europe is going to be, not the United States.
[00:12:47.078 --> 00:12:51.782]  And we look at this map, if you're watching this broadcast, you can see there's two different pipelines.
[00:12:52.362 --> 00:12:58.868]  One of them is coming from Iran and running up and over through Syria.
[00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:03.352]  That is the one that the Russians and the Syrian government and the Iranians want.
[00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:13.026]  Oh, they're on the other side from the people who want the one that's running from Qatar and up through Jordan and then through Turkey and into Europe.
[00:13:13.867 --> 00:13:16.049]  You see, it's always follow the money.
[00:13:16.589 --> 00:13:17.970]  It's that pipeline there, folks.
[00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:19.792]  That's the big, big part of it.
[00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.154]  And of course, there's other elements of this as well.
[00:13:22.895 --> 00:13:26.758]  We've talked about the UN plan that was exposed back in 2000.
[00:13:28.533 --> 00:13:30.174]  Nobody really talked about it much.
[00:13:30.414 --> 00:13:39.538]  WND focused on it with an article, and you can see in that plan, they're saying, hey, the birth rates are collapsing in the Western government, and we have an aging population.
[00:13:39.558 --> 00:13:42.660]  So we need to bring in millions and millions of people from the third world.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.402]  As we pointed out in the nightly news, they have
[00:13:47.321 --> 00:14:03.331]  The study that just came out this week showing that we've had over a 60% decline in 40 years in terms of sperm mobility and effectiveness in the West, not in developing countries.
[00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:09.135]  It's all this time they were telling us this is just affluence and people are just
[00:14:09.835 --> 00:14:14.637]  Delaying having children because of their career and that means that they can't have children as effectively.
[00:14:14.657 --> 00:14:16.877]  So it's a social issue that is here.
[00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:26.281]  No, we've been saying all along, and now there's a massive study that shows over 40 years, more than 60% decline in sperm count.
[00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:29.582]  And even if you're not planning on having children,
[00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:33.217]  It increases the morbidity and mortality of males.
[00:14:33.697 --> 00:14:37.040]  So this is an attack on men, but it's an attack on men in the West.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:45.846]  And this isn't happening in South America, in Asia, in Africa, where they're bringing in the replacements for us.
[00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:59.636]  Now they sold this back in 2000 saying, you want your entitlement programs, you want your social security, so we're going to bring in all these people who don't have any connection to your society and we're sure they're going to pay massive taxes
[00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:03.837]  No, that wasn't ever the case.
[00:15:03.877 --> 00:15:06.398]  Social Security has been a lie since it was created by Bismarck.
[00:15:06.598 --> 00:15:09.439]  They set the age of 65 because that was the life expectancy.
[00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:11.219]  They didn't expect anybody to get it.
[00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:16.600]  And now that people are living a little bit longer in some of these countries, they're saying, we've got an issue here.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.541]  We're going to be insolvent.
[00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:28.231]  Take down the benefits, and we've got to raise the retirement age and so forth, and we've got to flood your country with people from outside of it who will come in, obviously, as caretakers.
[00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:36.840]  No, they're coming not for freedom, not because they like our culture or our system of law, but because they want to live off of the welfare system.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.461]  Meanwhile, we have
[00:15:39.488 --> 00:15:43.689]  Our wonderful Republicans are showing us again what hypocrites they are.
[00:15:43.729 --> 00:15:48.910]  We had Eric Cantor, remember this last week now, we've had John Boehner come out and say, Obamacare is not going to pass.
[00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.130]  Not going to pass.
[00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:50.891]  Never going to happen.
[00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:53.211]  We're not going to have repeal.
[00:15:53.551 --> 00:16:01.193]  Now we had Eric Cantor come out and say, you know, we didn't really think it was going to happen, but if you've got that anger working for you, you're going to let it stay there.
[00:16:01.693 --> 00:16:05.854]  And so it's like, yeah, we use that anger in the Tea Party to get elected.
[00:16:06.636 --> 00:16:11.162]  And they go back to the 2013 when they had the defund Obamacare tour.
[00:16:11.222 --> 00:16:11.703]  Remember that?
[00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:12.784]  They could have defunded it.
[00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:14.407]  They had the House.
[00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:15.668]  They could have...
[00:16:16.877 --> 00:16:19.459]  Defunded it by not appropriating the money.
[00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:23.522]  And quite frankly, they didn't appropriate all the money that was needed by Obamacare.
[00:16:23.943 --> 00:16:28.426]  And so Obama stole it unconstitutionally from the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors.
[00:16:29.367 --> 00:16:33.050]  The House sued them in court and they won.
[00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.493]  The judge said no, money has to be allocated from the House.
[00:16:37.213 --> 00:16:39.716]  And so we had Eric Holder appeal it.
[00:16:40.496 --> 00:16:48.920]  And it's going through the appeal process, and the Justice Department under Attorney General Sessions could just let that go.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.462]  He could drop that appeal, and that would stand, and that would help to defund Obamacare.
[00:16:53.482 --> 00:17:03.147]  But they're not going to defund Obamacare, and they're not going to vote to repeal it now, even though they did it multiple times, as we talked about before, when they knew that it wasn't actually going to be taken away.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.421]  These are the Republicans that we can count on in Congress.
[00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:09.823]  Meanwhile, 15 million people would opt out of Obamacare if they could.
[00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:13.144]  Two-thirds of Americans want Obamacare repealed.
[00:17:13.864 --> 00:17:17.526]  And yet what they're saying is, we have to be concerned about
[00:17:18.464 --> 00:17:23.369]  Twenty million people that the Congressional Budget Office says are going to lose their health care.
[00:17:23.489 --> 00:17:24.951]  That was never the metric.
[00:17:25.571 --> 00:17:28.014]  It was never sold to us as universal health care.
[00:17:28.334 --> 00:17:30.497]  It was sold to us as affordable health care.
[00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:32.379]  Remember it was the Affordable Care Act.
[00:17:32.979 --> 00:17:34.080]  That was their official name.
[00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:35.182]  Affordable.
[00:17:35.302 --> 00:17:35.742]  Affordable.
[00:17:36.002 --> 00:17:37.644]  We're going to make it more affordable.
[00:17:37.864 --> 00:17:39.946]  We're going to bend the cost curve down.
[00:17:39.966 --> 00:17:40.767]  Remember all that rhetoric?
[00:17:41.468 --> 00:17:42.309]  It was never about that.
[00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:44.650]  It was about universal health care coverage.
[00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:46.432]  It was about single-payer coverage.
[00:17:46.452 --> 00:17:50.595]  It was about the government taking over all the decisions for your health care.
[00:17:50.975 --> 00:17:56.700]  About having a health czar in the person of the Secretary of the Health and Human Services.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.563]  We shouldn't have Washington making our health care decisions.
[00:18:02.324 --> 00:18:03.125]  We don't want that.
[00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:04.546]  That is the key issue.
[00:18:04.826 --> 00:18:08.089]  That is even a bigger issue than the mandates.
[00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:10.966]  Because you can change the level of mandates.
[00:18:10.986 --> 00:18:13.048]  You can change what insurance is mandated.
[00:18:13.128 --> 00:18:21.216]  Or you can remove the mandates during one administration, but then they'll get put right back on by the next administration if you leave a health czar in place.
[00:18:21.897 --> 00:18:23.899]  That's why Obamacare needs to be repealed.
[00:18:24.119 --> 00:18:25.901]  It's the structure that has to go.
[00:18:26.942 --> 00:18:30.826]  And so the mandates actually flow out of this
[00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:39.680]  entire structure, but it's the way that you have turned over our health care to be managed by a bureaucracy that needs to go.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.804]  And now even Jonathan Gruber, remember the guy who said he lied to the stupid Americans?
[00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:47.206]  He was the one who helped to get this through.
[00:18:47.586 --> 00:18:52.449]  Even he says the CBO is overestimating the impact of repealing the mandate.
[00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.432]  One of the architects of Obamacare is saying that.
[00:18:55.612 --> 00:18:57.894]  But that never was the issue.
[00:18:58.054 --> 00:18:59.535]  The issue was always affordability.
[00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:06.861]  And you and I both know the only way that you're going to make health care more affordable is to make it more of a free marketplace.
[00:19:07.742 --> 00:19:10.986]  If we had a free marketplace in health care, it would be a very different world.
[00:19:11.347 --> 00:19:13.029]  The free market is not the problem.
[00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.453]  The free market hasn't been tried in our lifetimes.
[00:19:17.506 --> 00:19:25.333]  Going back to World War II, when they instituted third-party health insurance and said that only corporations could get a deduction, not individuals.
[00:19:25.973 --> 00:19:27.735]  That is where this all began.
[00:19:27.755 --> 00:19:33.000]  I want to take a real quick look, though, before I get into some of the other issues that are happening in Washington.
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.161]  I want to take a look at how the GOP are now
[00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:39.845]  The tip of the spear coming after Donald Trump on the transgender ban.
[00:19:40.086 --> 00:19:45.290]  But I also want to talk about what's going on in the Nevada standoff trial.
[00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.972]  What happened at Bunkerville.
[00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:48.273]  I was there reporting.
[00:19:48.673 --> 00:19:53.277]  And I've got to tell you, this is something I feel very, very strongly about.
[00:19:53.617 --> 00:19:57.661]  And you will not believe what the judge is doing to this trial.
[00:19:58.221 --> 00:19:59.622]  It surprises even me.
[00:20:00.223 --> 00:20:03.646]  And very few people have a lower opinion of the government than I do.
[00:20:06.021 --> 00:20:12.487]  All right, so here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office.
[00:20:12.607 --> 00:20:13.427]  It's that serious.
[00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:15.129]  This is not a diversionary tactic.
[00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:16.130]  This stuff is real here.
[00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.653]  This coup, this silent coup that is taking place is real.
[00:20:19.993 --> 00:20:31.523]  A soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[00:20:32.063 --> 00:20:38.231]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[00:20:38.291 --> 00:20:43.959]  I got to go into the Congress and spend three hours from 9.30 in the evening to 12.30 a.m.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.303]  with one of the senior ranking members of Congress.
[00:20:48.265 --> 00:20:54.414]  And he told me, and of course this is what I said on CBN but they cut it out, but I'm going to go public with this because we have to.
[00:20:55.035 --> 00:20:59.081]  He said, there is a plot on Capitol Hill to take the president out.
[00:20:59.142 --> 00:21:01.565]  I said, you mean by impeachment or by indictment?
[00:21:01.605 --> 00:21:03.068]  He said, no, to take him out.
[00:21:03.488 --> 00:21:08.250]  This is an effort to subvert the administration of President Donald Trump.
[00:21:08.791 --> 00:21:09.851]  It is nothing less.
[00:21:10.011 --> 00:21:19.516]  It is an effort by the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and a legitimate government and to break the will of the American people.
[00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.778]  I'm not overconfident, I'm underconfident.
[00:21:22.938 --> 00:21:25.359]  Roger, they're going to pull some stuff.
[00:21:25.439 --> 00:21:26.560]  Obama's in for two months.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:36.246]  And now they're saying they want to unseat the elected president because he's a Russian agent and you've got the CIA in the middle of this.
[00:21:37.168 --> 00:21:41.031]  With Obama saying, we've got evidence they were involved.
[00:21:41.572 --> 00:21:49.899]  There's really no way to overstate the unprecedented peril that this country and this world is in right now.
[00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:59.967]  Unprecedented with the CIA involved and electors getting ready to vote against Trump and all this other garbage, I'm here to tell you.
[00:22:01.534 --> 00:22:08.775]  Under Continuative Government Systems, if there really was someone put in by the Russians, then the directives are to move to remove them.
[00:22:10.556 --> 00:22:22.938]  This is the cover they need inside government to pretend they're a bunch of patriots and try to organize enough people out of agencies to make a move against Trump to remove him or even assassinate him.
[00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:25.358]  And it can go a lot of different ways.
[00:22:26.419 --> 00:22:27.979]  They announce the electors aren't going for Trump.
[00:22:29.025 --> 00:22:31.046]  Next time he gets on board his plane, it blows up.
[00:22:31.066 --> 00:22:35.848]  And they'll just say it's a conspiracy theory, we don't know why it blew up, don't ask why it blew up.
[00:22:35.908 --> 00:22:38.790]  That's how brazen they are.
[00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:46.953]  Because they want a riot, they want a civil war, then they can bring in their control because they can't win a peaceful information war.
[00:22:47.694 --> 00:22:54.857]  You have a politicization of the agencies that is resulting in leaks from anonymous, unknown people.
[00:22:55.718 --> 00:22:57.939]  And the intention is to take down a president.
[00:22:58.439 --> 00:23:00.840]  Now this is very dangerous to America.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.801]  It's a threat to our republic.
[00:23:03.301 --> 00:23:08.182]  It constitutes a clear and present danger to our way of life.
[00:23:08.683 --> 00:23:17.706]  Government bureaucrats, particularly within the intelligence community, have launched a soft coup aimed at the Trump administration.
[00:23:17.886 --> 00:23:19.186]  You can read between the lines.
[00:23:19.246 --> 00:23:21.427]  I said, look, I said that's not going to happen.
[00:23:21.927 --> 00:23:24.509]  He said, he said, well really there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[00:23:24.589 --> 00:23:30.294]  I said we are going to stop it because we're going to mobilize the body of Christ to pray.
[00:23:30.634 --> 00:23:35.178]  And the best description of it is by Barry Castleman in his blog where he said this is a coup d'etat.
[00:23:35.858 --> 00:23:39.682]  He said 14 million citizens in private ballots picked Donald Trump.
[00:23:40.522 --> 00:23:42.444]  20 TV executives have decided to destroy him.
[00:23:42.584 --> 00:23:43.865]  This is no longer a
[00:23:44.525 --> 00:23:58.708]  About Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, this is about a full-on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump.
[00:24:22.293 --> 00:24:23.635]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:24.776]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:24:25.477 --> 00:24:27.300]  We have a clip coming up.
[00:24:28.081 --> 00:24:35.891]  Probably play that in the next segment about Al Gore saying we have a challenging event that he believes is going to be happening soon.
[00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:37.854]  He said, let me get serious here for a moment.
[00:24:38.396 --> 00:24:43.718]  Because I guess he was talking about the climate change hoax with a comedy crew.
[00:24:43.778 --> 00:24:45.879]  But he said, let me get serious here.
[00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:48.960]  I think the next few months may be a little bit challenging for our country.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.401]  And we best gird ourselves for it.
[00:24:52.021 --> 00:24:53.422]  This thing is not going well.
[00:24:53.442 --> 00:24:54.522]  So we're going to talk about that.
[00:24:54.542 --> 00:25:00.705]  We're going to talk about a new report that I heard on the way in this morning on the radio that is being sold to us by the government media.
[00:25:01.645 --> 00:25:04.466]  Saying the increase in forest fires that we're seeing here.
[00:25:04.826 --> 00:25:08.146]  And I don't know if there is an increase or they certainly are getting bigger.
[00:25:08.566 --> 00:25:09.766]  It's all about global warming.
[00:25:10.627 --> 00:25:10.987]  Oh really?
[00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:14.687]  I've got some data that says otherwise about that.
[00:25:15.227 --> 00:25:19.648]  But I want to talk about what's happening in Nevada with the Bunkerville trials.
[00:25:19.808 --> 00:25:21.288]  And this is reported by Reuters.
[00:25:21.348 --> 00:25:28.630]  They just had somebody who was there get 68 years in prison for being at the Nevada standoff.
[00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.830]  I was there.
[00:25:30.683 --> 00:25:36.727]  And I've got to tell you, this is one of the most egregious miscarriages of justice that I've ever seen in my life.
[00:25:37.388 --> 00:25:41.031]  Having been at that event, we were there a few days beforehand covering it.
[00:25:41.591 --> 00:25:43.773]  We were there as the standoff was happening.
[00:25:44.033 --> 00:25:47.215]  I was down there at the wash with the first few people.
[00:25:47.615 --> 00:25:50.438]  I heard them threatening to shoot us.
[00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:54.697]  And I saw people standing around, most of them not armed.
[00:25:55.377 --> 00:25:59.458]  Some of them had weapons and holsters, which is allowed in Nevada.
[00:26:00.098 --> 00:26:10.280]  And if you look at that picture, pull that picture up there again, if you look at that picture, zoom in there or circle it with the mouse there, right in front of that, it's in front of that white flag in the shadow, that's me.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.840]  I'm turning around shooting at the crowd.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.841]  I got tired of being threatened to be shot.
[00:26:16.769 --> 00:26:21.293]  There was a Fox News man who was still there, and he was afraid as well.
[00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:23.735]  And he wanted to get over to the side where the government was.
[00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:27.939]  And he had his camera with him, and he was trying to lift up, he was lifting up his shirt.
[00:26:27.979 --> 00:26:28.740]  Don't shoot Fox News!
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.501]  Don't shoot Fox News!
[00:26:29.821 --> 00:26:32.964]  Lifting up his shirt to show them that he didn't have any weapons or anything.
[00:26:33.344 --> 00:26:36.207]  They kept threatening him, and he never got all the way over there.
[00:26:36.247 --> 00:26:38.269]  He stopped about 100 feet away from them.
[00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:41.431]  But he wanted to get to where the government was.
[00:26:41.571 --> 00:26:51.717]  I wanted to see what was going to happen, and we were standing there for quite a long time as the crowd began to build, and it gradually started to inch forward, inch forward, and the whole time they're threatening us.
[00:26:52.758 --> 00:26:55.000]  And at one point I just said, you know, I'm just tired of this.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:01.264]  I got in front of them, and I started shooting, and then that's when they all started to just walk after having stood there for a while.
[00:27:01.284 --> 00:27:02.965]  Because if you want to shoot me in the back,
[00:27:04.346 --> 00:27:07.688]  Like a bunch of cowards after you've been threatening to shoot us, then go ahead and do it.
[00:27:07.868 --> 00:27:09.930]  I've got a camera in my hand, go ahead and shoot me in the back.
[00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:18.095]  Now these people that they're accusing, this guy, he had eight felony accounts, he's 53 years old, Gregory Berlson of Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:27:18.755 --> 00:27:20.156]  They found him guilty back in April.
[00:27:20.196 --> 00:27:22.898]  Now they've sentenced him to 68 years.
[00:27:23.598 --> 00:27:24.199]  Think about that.
[00:27:24.219 --> 00:27:25.559]  68 years.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.280]  How many years did Hillary Clinton get?
[00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:30.823]  She didn't get 68 minutes in jail, did she?
[00:27:31.834 --> 00:27:31.994]  Yeah.
[00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:33.075]  One standard for them.
[00:27:33.755 --> 00:27:42.579]  One standard to show that they can do whatever they want to to people, and we cannot ever stand with our neighbors for their rights as they're being taken away.
[00:27:43.239 --> 00:27:45.340]  They said he threatened and assaulted federal officers.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.541]  Well, no, actually nobody was threatening them.
[00:27:47.621 --> 00:27:48.581]  They had the megaphone.
[00:27:48.621 --> 00:27:49.602]  They were threatening us.
[00:27:50.242 --> 00:27:54.344]  And the assault is supposedly the fact that you're carrying, legally, a weapon.
[00:27:55.734 --> 00:27:55.774]  No.
[00:28:26.374 --> 00:28:30.838]  And this is a situation where they have, these are the rules that they have put on the defense attorneys.
[00:28:31.258 --> 00:28:38.663]  They've told them the defense cannot discuss the videos of Margaret Houston being thrown to the ground, or Ammon Bundy being tasered by the BLM.
[00:28:39.143 --> 00:28:43.606]  They cannot discuss the First Amendment area that the government established to force people into.
[00:28:44.087 --> 00:28:48.110]  You can't mention the arrest of Dave Bundy or his subsequent treatment.
[00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.913]  There is to be no mention of the Clark County Commissioner Tom Collins statements, according to the judge.
[00:28:53.433 --> 00:28:54.114]  No mention of that.
[00:28:54.614 --> 00:28:59.079]  Including folks from Utah, he said, were a bunch of inbred bastards.
[00:28:59.099 --> 00:29:02.222]  That's his statement, talking about the Mormons who came there.
[00:29:02.262 --> 00:29:08.889]  And if we're coming to Clark County, Nevada to support Clive and Bundy, you better have funeral plans, is what he said.
[00:29:09.653 --> 00:29:12.575]  There's to be no mention of the BLM destroying Clive and Bundy's water tanks.
[00:29:12.675 --> 00:29:16.558]  No videos of the massive military-style compound they set up for the operation.
[00:29:16.918 --> 00:29:25.104]  No mention of federal cattle rustling or the slaughter of his prized bulls that they then subsequently buried to try to hide their crime.
[00:29:25.505 --> 00:29:27.306]  The jurors have not heard any of these instructions.
[00:29:28.047 --> 00:29:30.869]  They don't let them know that the BLM is not to be talked about.
[00:29:31.656 --> 00:29:35.058]  No mention of the misconduct of the BLM is to be allowed.
[00:29:35.598 --> 00:29:44.224]  No mention of Dan Love, the guy who ran this operation, who was criticized by other BLM agents at his level, saying, what is this guy trying to do?
[00:29:44.464 --> 00:29:46.125]  They are railroading these people.
[00:29:46.545 --> 00:29:47.646]  This is an outrage.
[00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:48.967]  You need to find out what's going on.
[00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:51.528]  We're going to talk to people about this in a later day.
[00:29:51.568 --> 00:29:52.048]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:52.108 --> 00:29:53.609]  Infowars will be right back.
[00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.711]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:59.333]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.013 --> 00:30:12.760]  After speaking with his military staff, President Trump has banned transgenders from the military, citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:19.005]  His decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another.
[00:30:19.085 --> 00:30:23.509]  In other news, President Trump also publicly blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not replacing
[00:30:23.689 --> 00:30:30.334]  Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe was at the center of controversy after his wife received $700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:30.354 --> 00:30:32.876]  McCabe was handling the FBI investigation into Clinton.
[00:30:32.896 --> 00:30:37.699]  The president also blasted Sessions on Tuesday for taking, quote, a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes.
[00:30:37.839 --> 00:30:43.823]  So far, Sessions has focused more on ramping up civil asset forfeiture and prosecuting marijuana users and investigating Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:43.883 --> 00:30:47.306]  CNN, however, has launched an investigation into media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[00:30:47.406 --> 00:30:53.410]  The founder of the Drudge Report has been spending a lot of time at the White House, which has forced establishment media to not only acknowledge his influence over Trump,
[00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.172]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:30:55.192 --> 00:30:56.594]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than
[00:31:11.733 --> 00:31:14.014]  Than this slogan and my face.
[00:31:14.254 --> 00:31:17.216]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:17.596 --> 00:31:20.598]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:20.798 --> 00:31:24.240]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.321]  The left controls culture.
[00:31:26.361 --> 00:31:27.342]  They control arts.
[00:31:27.402 --> 00:31:28.622]  They control entertainment.
[00:31:28.923 --> 00:31:36.006]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:36.066 --> 00:31:38.408]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:31:38.948 --> 00:31:42.791]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:48.236]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan.
[00:31:48.496 --> 00:31:50.938]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:51.198 --> 00:31:57.444]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:31:57.524 --> 00:31:59.225]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:31:59.365 --> 00:32:00.566]  It's available right now.

[00:33:09.426 --> 00:33:10.308]  You found it.
[00:33:10.648 --> 00:33:12.130]  The tip of the spear.
[00:33:12.671 --> 00:33:15.135]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.838 --> 00:33:19.662]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[00:33:22.472 --> 00:33:25.273]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, July 27, 2017.
[00:33:25.373 --> 00:33:34.978]  We had Alex Jones is going to be joining us in just a moment to talk about Al Gore's cryptic comments on the Late Late Show last night.
[00:33:35.118 --> 00:33:40.920]  So, yet another example of somebody saying, hey, in the next few months, something's going to happen.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.381]  You better get ready for something that's going to happen.
[00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:44.402]  So we're going to play that clip.
[00:33:44.462 --> 00:33:45.923]  Alex is going to break that down for you.
[00:33:46.383 --> 00:33:48.464]  I thought it was kind of interesting that the
[00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:55.145]  The storm that has been triggered, as The Hill points out, Trump triggers a storm with the transgender ban.
[00:33:55.626 --> 00:33:59.569]  The people who are coming after him, apparently the most, are conservatives.
[00:33:59.789 --> 00:34:00.590]  What a surprise!
[00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:07.275]  The same GOP, the duplicitous GOP, that said things like, we're going to get rid of Obamacare.
[00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:11.879]  I remember when they said, we're going to get rid of the Department of Education, right after Jimmy Carter did it.
[00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:17.224]  So they campaign on these things, they get elected for them, but they want the government controlling your life.
[00:34:17.904 --> 00:34:22.445]  We had Eric Cantor yesterday saying, well, if you've got a lot of anger out there, you're going to use that to get elected.
[00:34:23.065 --> 00:34:24.285]  And that's precisely what they did.
[00:34:24.706 --> 00:34:33.027]  Now they have an opportunity to simply repeal it, to start enacting market reforms that would actually make health care more affordable, but they don't do it.
[00:34:33.527 --> 00:34:40.069]  And so now you've got the conservatives, as CNN's headline says, conservatives lobbied the White House for a transgender policy.
[00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:42.810]  But the total ban wasn't what they asked for.
[00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:44.330]  They're very concerned about it.
[00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:46.931]  And as they say, it's a growing GOP backlash.
[00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:48.651]  They say it's a political miscalculation.
[00:34:48.671 --> 00:34:50.752]  Well, who was it that made the political calculation?
[00:34:50.772 --> 00:34:53.633]  The Washington Post quotes John McCain.
[00:34:53.993 --> 00:34:56.014]  And listen to the way the Washington Post describes John McCain.
[00:34:56.354 --> 00:34:57.594]  War hero John McCain.
[00:34:57.614 --> 00:35:00.175]  The preeminent Republican voice on national security.
[00:35:01.443 --> 00:35:03.705]  Not the leader of the military-industrial complex.
[00:35:03.986 --> 00:35:10.832]  But then we have people like Orrin Hatch from conservative Utah coming out and saying, I don't think we should be discriminating against anyone.
[00:35:10.872 --> 00:35:13.555]  Well, let's understand the military has a mission.
[00:35:14.456 --> 00:35:16.077]  You don't have a right to join the military.
[00:35:17.154 --> 00:35:18.917]  It's not an entitlement program.
[00:35:19.678 --> 00:35:20.839]  There are certain conditions.
[00:35:20.939 --> 00:35:30.092]  As a matter of fact, I had Daria give me a book here from Military.com talking about medical conditions that prevent you from joining the military.
[00:35:30.132 --> 00:35:31.293]  These are physical conditions.
[00:35:31.834 --> 00:35:41.298]  It's all kinds of things, abdominal organs and gastrointestinal systems, dental, you don't have the right kind of, you've got some dental problems, you can't join ears, hearing, eyes, so forth.
[00:35:41.358 --> 00:35:48.642]  I had a friend who went to West Point, he was kicked out at the last minute because they found a small ulcer in his stomach.
[00:35:49.082 --> 00:35:51.083]  So you don't have a guarantee to do that.
[00:35:51.383 --> 00:35:57.366]  And yet, at the same time now, we have the establishment coming after Donald Trump saying,
[00:35:58.126 --> 00:36:06.170]  He needs to be examined remote control by people looking at him on television in violation of the Goldwater rule and we know why that was put in.
[00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.491]  We have an article on Infowars.com talking about that.
[00:36:08.751 --> 00:36:17.035]  That was put in because they came after Barry Goldwater, made outrageous claims about him that he sued them for and won and they said it's unethical.
[00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:21.299]  For us to diagnose people's mental conditions by watching them on television.
[00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:29.005]  Now you've got all the news media, from NPR, CNN and others, are all saying we need to overturn that rule so we can attack President Trump.
[00:36:29.286 --> 00:36:30.787]  Alex Jones is joining us right now.
[00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:33.449]  It's not just coming after him mentally, is it Alex?
[00:36:33.469 --> 00:36:36.412]  Are you going to possibly have some kind of a quick event?
[00:36:36.432 --> 00:36:39.615]  It seems to be what Al Gore is talking about as well.
[00:36:41.098 --> 00:36:41.778]  That's right, David.
[00:36:41.798 --> 00:36:43.459]  You're doing a fabulous job there.
[00:36:43.499 --> 00:36:45.540]  Leanne McAdoo is joining us in the next hour.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:58.484]  Then you're going to be back in the third hour playing traffic cop with our interview with Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag getting into how reality TV is so fake and staged.
[00:36:58.604 --> 00:37:01.265]  That's all coming up today, David.
[00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:02.766]  So, thank you so much.
[00:37:02.926 --> 00:37:05.407]  In fact, I want to come back to you just briefly in a few minutes, then I'm going to let you
[00:37:06.187 --> 00:37:11.031]  Get back to research and preparation until you co-host in the third hour.
[00:37:11.071 --> 00:37:21.540]  But I do want to get your overall take about what we should do specifically dealing with the big issue that's on our plate that I'm going to get into right now.
[00:37:22.901 --> 00:37:32.189]  I told listeners three weeks ago on air that the decision had been made to kill President Trump the next few months.
[00:37:33.865 --> 00:37:38.107]  That the decision had been made to violently remove him from office suddenly.
[00:37:39.248 --> 00:37:45.871]  And I told you when he got elected, and I told you in January when he got inaugurated, that the deep state is preparing a COG
[00:37:47.557 --> 00:37:55.501]  Continuity of government smokescreen to claim he's controlled by foreign powers when they're the ones controlled by multinational foreign powers.
[00:37:56.202 --> 00:38:05.887]  And that they would then try to remove him, declare the last election null and void, and hold a new election run by Homeland Security and the Democrats.
[00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:09.489]  Now we know all this because Obama signed an executive order to do just that.
[00:38:10.373 --> 00:38:17.715]  And they talked about doing it during the interim when he was president-elect before he was sworn in on January 20th there in Washington, D.C.
[00:38:18.516 --> 00:38:22.557]  So we've seen the media preparing the ground, preparing the mind for this.
[00:38:23.657 --> 00:38:38.382]  And then, starting about three and a half, four weeks ago, myself and many others began to get phone calls, some of them from trusted sources inside the, quote, government, saying, look,
[00:38:40.049 --> 00:38:41.410]  Trump's going to get taken out.
[00:38:42.911 --> 00:38:44.032]  That's just the way it is.
[00:38:44.132 --> 00:38:46.073]  And everybody needs to just get on board with it.
[00:38:46.553 --> 00:38:48.574]  Even if you're a patriot, this is just the way it is.
[00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:50.155]  Live to fight another day.
[00:38:50.255 --> 00:38:51.236]  Live the long game.
[00:38:51.596 --> 00:38:52.437]  Take care of yourself.
[00:38:52.457 --> 00:38:53.377]  Take care of your family.
[00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:54.858]  He's just going to be removed.
[00:38:54.878 --> 00:38:58.561]  And of course, they're putting out as a PSYOP to see who they can condition.
[00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:03.680]  And scare into going along with it, thinking they're on the winning team.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.821]  It's a huge psychological game.
[00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:07.222]  They're the ones that lost the election.
[00:39:08.002 --> 00:39:10.303]  They're the ones that got caught rigging the debates.
[00:39:10.343 --> 00:39:13.085]  They're the ones that got caught in the WikiLeaks committing all the crimes.
[00:39:13.385 --> 00:39:22.209]  They're the ones getting caught selling out to the Communist Chinese, and selling out the Panama Canal, and selling out our weapons systems to China, and selling out nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.971]  They're the ones on every single front
[00:39:27.549 --> 00:39:33.354]  In every single way, over and over and over again, that are the dishonorable globalists, that are discredited, that are hated.
[00:39:33.374 --> 00:39:34.755]  They're the ones with the illegal servers.
[00:39:35.336 --> 00:39:39.019]  They're the ones who are becoming a minority party.
[00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:41.160]  And I don't mean minority as in minorities.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.261]  The media will spin that.
[00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:48.406]  I mean a minority party in only a few areas of the country, not even a real national party.
[00:39:48.426 --> 00:39:52.269]  So everything the Democrats have told us is going to happen to the Republicans,
[00:39:53.066 --> 00:40:00.812]  Because the establishment got them to play along with the system and sell out their values and disenfranchise their voters and try to demoralize them.
[00:40:01.253 --> 00:40:04.615]  It's now happened to the Democrats, because the libertarian movement took over the Tea Party.
[00:40:04.956 --> 00:40:05.656]  We created it.
[00:40:06.217 --> 00:40:08.338]  They tried to take it over, but we really took them over.
[00:40:08.799 --> 00:40:13.202]  And now there's a civil war in the Republican Party, politically, for the heart and soul of the country.
[00:40:13.443 --> 00:40:16.005]  The Democrats are delusional, basically out to pasture.
[00:40:17.099 --> 00:40:18.440]  And the elites know they're in trouble.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:30.886]  They're busy evacuating to the Cook Islands, and to Tasmania, and to the Australian mainland, and to Kauai, Hawaii, where I'm sitting right now, and I'm literally doing an investigation of Zuckerberg today.
[00:40:31.867 --> 00:40:32.687]  Just get that out there.
[00:40:34.088 --> 00:40:38.671]  So, you have to understand, they're the ones that know 90% chance they're going down.
[00:40:39.031 --> 00:40:42.733]  In their own internal documents, they say globalism's collapsing five years ago.
[00:40:43.655 --> 00:40:52.522]  I had analysts and people on 10 years ago saying the EU was going to collapse, things would devolve back to the Midwest, back to the States, back to Texas, that DC was making itself obsolete.
[00:40:53.623 --> 00:40:59.807]  And the decisions have been made by people who are actually patriotic to work towards that in the government and in major corporations.
[00:40:59.847 --> 00:41:03.811]  So there's not just some monolithic New World Order power structure here.
[00:41:04.531 --> 00:41:23.168]  But just like they have the bots working overtime, and they have the TV shows, and the movies, and the dramas, and the fiction shows, and the fiction fiction fake news of CNN posing as reality, telling you that patriots are losing, telling you that world government's imminent, telling you that Christians are bad, telling you that the borders are open to Muslims, and it's no big deal.
[00:41:24.009 --> 00:41:24.970]  Despite all that,
[00:41:26.024 --> 00:41:26.724]  It's a facade.
[00:41:27.464 --> 00:41:35.066]  But if we buy into the facade, if we buy into the mirage, if we buy into the delusion, if we buy into the fraud, if we buy into the mind control, they win.
[00:41:36.246 --> 00:41:36.987]  That's all this is.
[00:41:37.347 --> 00:41:40.007]  The world's ours, if we want it.
[00:41:40.928 --> 00:41:42.428]  But it's all a giant mind game.
[00:41:42.448 --> 00:41:54.551]  So you notice, going back almost a month ago, I said that, started getting calls about a month ago, and it ended about two weeks ago from different people, saying Trump's basically gonna go.
[00:41:55.785 --> 00:42:05.528]  And you better not say anything or do anything during the process of this, because we're your friends and we're just letting you know that's the way the cookie crumbles.
[00:42:07.029 --> 00:42:11.570]  And then you start hearing the drums and establishment publications beating for that.
[00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:23.995]  Then you have a senior evangelical pastor, Mr. Brown, we got on yesterday, who goes and meets with the President, and then goes and meets with senior members of Congress, and a senior member, and he says they're floating the idea of a coup in the next month or so.
[00:42:25.111 --> 00:42:37.195]  A violent overthrow of Trump, a quick removal, a immobilization of the president, and this is going to happen in the next month or two.
[00:42:39.136 --> 00:42:47.139]  Then you see three days after that happens, Clapper goes on national TV with Brennan
[00:42:48.283 --> 00:42:52.205]  And Brennan says we need to not wait for impeachment.
[00:42:52.225 --> 00:42:55.687]  We need to suddenly remove him and it's coming and that's happening right now.
[00:42:55.727 --> 00:42:58.588]  We need America to be bipartisan and not tear itself apart.
[00:42:58.708 --> 00:42:59.529]  Then Al Gore.
[00:43:00.734 --> 00:43:06.177]  Last night he goes on the James Corden Show, on the Late Late Show, which shows what a loser he is.
[00:43:06.197 --> 00:43:08.719]  He didn't even get on the main show, he's on the Late Late Show.
[00:43:09.299 --> 00:43:10.960]  With like a half million viewers or whatever.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:19.845]  And he goes on there, and this con man of NAFTA and GATT, this con man of TPP, this con man of all his garbage and carbon taxes and everything.
[00:43:20.325 --> 00:43:28.277]  This comment that said polar bears couldn't swim, and that carbon dioxide was going up, and that by 2013 we'd be underwater in San Francisco and L.A.
[00:43:28.538 --> 00:43:30.040]  while he's buying mansions on the beach.
[00:43:30.521 --> 00:43:35.769]  This guy that said the ice caps would be totally melted by 2013 when they've both gotten bigger, especially Antarctica.
[00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:42.733]  You've got all this happening, and he says, oh, yeah, you know, ask me about Trump.
[00:43:42.793 --> 00:43:44.214]  Something big's about to happen.
[00:43:44.974 --> 00:43:46.415]  And, you know, things aren't going well.
[00:43:46.475 --> 00:43:47.936]  Something big's about to happen.
[00:43:48.737 --> 00:44:05.268]  They're all out there running their mouths, and they've got all these followers and all these weaklings and the same ones that thought Hillary was invincible, and the same ones that thought they had America by the short hairs, and they had their boot on our neck, the same ones that never did anything in their lives but run their mouths.
[00:44:05.828 --> 00:44:06.869]  Those same cowards.
[00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.414]  Who had America in a trance.
[00:44:10.777 --> 00:44:13.783]  Metaphysically like a vampire that's got you in a trance while it sucks your blood.
[00:44:16.078 --> 00:44:18.099]  Don't know what to do now that we've got them by the throat.
[00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:27.144]  And they're trying to convince themselves, and convince us, like Ka in the Jungle Book with his eyes spinning, going, Sleep!
[00:44:27.684 --> 00:44:29.325]  Sleep!
[00:44:29.705 --> 00:44:31.726]  Let us sexualize your children.
[00:44:31.866 --> 00:44:32.626]  Sleep!
[00:44:32.967 --> 00:44:34.908]  Let us open your borders to the Islamists.
[00:44:35.288 --> 00:44:36.528]  Sleep!
[00:44:36.989 --> 00:44:38.129]  Let us take your guns.
[00:44:38.249 --> 00:44:38.810]  Sleep!
[00:44:40.034 --> 00:44:42.656]  Almost every liberal I know is out taking firearms classes now.
[00:44:43.336 --> 00:44:45.918]  That's the biggest buyers at gun shops from California to Texas.
[00:44:46.979 --> 00:44:48.520]  The globalists are in free-fall panic.
[00:44:49.241 --> 00:44:49.961]  They don't know what to do.
[00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:51.282]  Their culture's dying.
[00:44:51.562 --> 00:44:53.103]  People don't have confidence in them anymore.
[00:44:53.303 --> 00:45:00.488]  They know the social compact has been broken by design and that socialism, collectivism, and crony capitalism delivers us to tyranny.
[00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:06.192]  Delivers us to impoverishment.
[00:45:06.893 --> 00:45:08.354]  Delivers us to enslavement.
[00:45:08.834 --> 00:45:09.355]  And they know
[00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:33.517]  So you've got Al Gore and all the King's horses and all the King's men and Brennan, the Wahhabist Islamist, the little Jihadi, all these people together in their big armies of cowards, all clucking and screaming and running around like a bunch of chickens on PCP with their heads half cut off, running off the edge of a cliff screaming that they're in some kamikaze jihad.
[00:45:34.702 --> 00:45:35.582]  Against America.
[00:45:35.642 --> 00:45:37.543]  And it doesn't matter what you do to Trump.
[00:45:37.923 --> 00:45:39.283]  It doesn't matter what you do to me.
[00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:40.064]  It doesn't matter.
[00:45:40.484 --> 00:45:44.985]  As long as people understand we've gone from being way behind to devastating them.
[00:45:45.225 --> 00:45:47.966]  And their world government system is collapsing.
[00:45:48.226 --> 00:45:50.807]  And their systems where big megacorporations are tax exempt.
[00:45:52.509 --> 00:45:54.610]  And then they screw us over and raise our taxes?
[00:45:55.431 --> 00:45:59.193]  A microcosm of Zuckerberg came to Kauai, tried to run people off their land.
[00:45:59.233 --> 00:46:01.274]  He's hated by everyone all over the island.
[00:46:01.895 --> 00:46:05.337]  Just because I've bashed him for years, they'd love me all over the place.
[00:46:05.597 --> 00:46:06.758]  There's a few liberals that don't.
[00:46:08.419 --> 00:46:10.420]  And they're all freaked out and don't know what to do when they see me.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.341]  It's like they've seen the Antichrist walking down the street.
[00:46:13.182 --> 00:46:16.664]  Because people are awake, folks, and they've chosen sides.
[00:46:17.064 --> 00:46:18.585]  Things are now polarized.
[00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:29.978]  And so they can run around over and over and over and over and over again and cry on their god of big government and collectivism to save them, but he won't deliver them.
[00:46:31.579 --> 00:46:45.422]  Just like we used the story of Elijah yesterday when the priests are up there saying, you know, our god will make this mountaintop catch on fire and then after they try all that, Elijah has to dump a bunch of water on it just to prove the point and then the whole thing bursts into fire.
[00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:48.300]  These people are failures.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:48.940]  They know it.
[00:46:49.241 --> 00:46:52.863]  They think by pulling down winners, that will make them winners.
[00:46:53.244 --> 00:46:54.424]  That's never the way it's worked.
[00:46:54.504 --> 00:46:56.066]  So, they are preparing.
[00:46:56.086 --> 00:46:58.527]  And here's the big $64 trillion question.
[00:46:59.748 --> 00:47:01.850]  They aren't just preparing in secret now.
[00:47:02.691 --> 00:47:04.732]  They aren't just doing little whisper campaigns.
[00:47:05.052 --> 00:47:13.278]  They aren't just calling up all the cowards and all the coward's men and all the coward's wives and children and dogs and everything else.
[00:47:14.358 --> 00:47:18.422]  They are just getting themselves hyped up in this existential deal.
[00:47:18.883 --> 00:47:31.737]  Even though they've still got the country by the short hairs in many ways, even though they've still got all the major money in real estate, Trump's just taking full power away from them and saying, we're going to have some prosperity and some open bidding and we're not going to have one-way streets.
[00:47:32.017 --> 00:47:35.879]  So Hollywood and the anti-Christian crowd could pee on America and feel powerful.
[00:47:36.139 --> 00:47:48.544]  Your little counting coup simulation, rubbing America's face in the dirt, rubbing it in the manure, your little ritual of defacing America and vandalizing America and having your little, you know, little ritual.
[00:47:49.444 --> 00:47:50.105]  Over America.
[00:47:50.185 --> 00:47:51.605]  That's coming to an end.
[00:47:52.186 --> 00:47:54.127]  And it's that spirit they hate.
[00:47:54.567 --> 00:47:57.149]  And so they are now on the warpath.
[00:47:57.209 --> 00:47:57.949]  And this is good.
[00:47:58.369 --> 00:47:59.910]  Because it's drawing them all out.
[00:48:00.651 --> 00:48:03.392]  And they're now... Because they're having to try to get their crews ready for this.
[00:48:03.933 --> 00:48:05.954]  They're trying to get people ready to go kill the President.
[00:48:06.614 --> 00:48:07.715]  And then come after everybody.
[00:48:08.763 --> 00:48:10.745]  And so they wanted to all do it in secret and get it all prepared.
[00:48:10.965 --> 00:48:12.086]  You and I have all exposed it.
[00:48:12.366 --> 00:48:14.167]  So now we're going to force them out of their rat holes.
[00:48:14.427 --> 00:48:15.768]  And now they're out of their little rat holes.
[00:48:16.189 --> 00:48:23.034]  Brennan and Clapper on TV organizing their coup with Wolf Blitzer who goes, oh, but you've got to impeach him.
[00:48:23.314 --> 00:48:23.794]  Congress.
[00:48:24.035 --> 00:48:24.775]  Blitzer's scared.
[00:48:26.096 --> 00:48:27.097]  You can't do that.
[00:48:27.117 --> 00:48:28.138]  He knows what he's doing.
[00:48:28.598 --> 00:48:30.319]  He's not signing his John Hancock to that.
[00:48:30.839 --> 00:48:32.781]  We've got Blitzer and Brennan.
[00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:34.422]  You've got to kind of give them a little credit, finally.
[00:48:34.782 --> 00:48:38.004]  They're arrogantly, when they're not saying, shut your mouth, the president.
[00:48:38.264 --> 00:48:38.845]  Watch your mouth.
[00:48:39.585 --> 00:48:42.867]  They're up there like little meerkats up on a little sand hill.
[00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:44.148]  It's on our body.
[00:48:44.168 --> 00:48:45.709]  We're going, we're going, killing!
[00:48:46.249 --> 00:48:47.070]  We big now!
[00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.730]  We tough!
[00:48:48.451 --> 00:48:51.233]  As if you're going to play that out now with everybody watching.
[00:48:51.493 --> 00:48:51.893]  This did in 1963.
[00:48:56.325 --> 00:48:57.246]  This is crazy.
[00:48:57.386 --> 00:48:57.946]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:48:58.246 --> 00:49:01.328]  I saw the polls out yesterday in CNN.
[00:49:01.749 --> 00:49:06.092]  CNN's on their own polls again, where they're sampling these 20-something percent more points for Hillary.
[00:49:06.492 --> 00:49:13.537]  In states that Trump won, you know, the purple states that were in between red and blue, guess what, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:49:14.777 --> 00:49:18.340]  President Trump is underwater.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.581]  He's down in those states.
[00:49:20.161 --> 00:49:24.304]  He was down 5, 10, 15 points on election night in your fake polls.
[00:49:25.438 --> 00:49:28.340]  But again, they use that same garbage.
[00:49:29.041 --> 00:49:30.862]  The mind control of these fake polls.
[00:49:30.902 --> 00:49:34.705]  So let's go ahead and play a clip of Al Gore last night.
[00:49:35.465 --> 00:49:39.068]  This is Al Gore last night on TV.
[00:49:39.528 --> 00:49:40.869]  Again, just putting it out.
[00:49:40.889 --> 00:49:43.091]  You know something bad's about to happen to Trump.
[00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:45.192]  He's gonna do something bad.
[00:49:45.212 --> 00:49:46.413]  Gonna fall down and hit his head.
[00:49:47.134 --> 00:49:48.735]  Gonna fall down on his little facey.
[00:49:49.515 --> 00:49:49.876]  Here it is.
[00:49:50.891 --> 00:50:00.620]  I'm interested to know, and this of course would never ever happen, ever ever, but let's just say, imagine for a second that you are the Vice President today, right now.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:07.506]  And President Trump, the door to the Oval Office opens and he shouts, hey Al, I'm gonna fire out a tweet.
[00:50:09.147 --> 00:50:11.249]  Should I do it?
[00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:12.550]  What do you go in and say?
[00:50:13.411 --> 00:50:14.452]  I would not go in.
[00:50:22.769 --> 00:50:30.896]  To be serious Vermont, I think the next few months may be a little challenging for our country and we best gird ourselves for it.
[00:50:30.956 --> 00:50:32.478]  This thing is not going well.
[00:50:33.258 --> 00:50:33.659]  Thoughts?
[00:50:35.981 --> 00:50:37.762]  So, they make fun of the President.
[00:50:37.802 --> 00:50:39.444]  How dare him directly communicate with the American people?
[00:50:41.852 --> 00:50:45.694]  And then they talk about how, well, something big's about to happen and things aren't going well.
[00:50:45.994 --> 00:50:46.474]  That's right!
[00:50:46.795 --> 00:51:02.883]  The same scam artist that worked with Enron to create the carbon taxes and the smart meters and the electric cars and all the rest of it to screw us over, the same guy that makes the money off the carbon taxes, he's gonna sit there like a big, bloated, lying conman and float the end of the president.
[00:51:12.614 --> 00:51:13.498]  We need funding.
[00:51:13.538 --> 00:51:14.603]  The enemy's after us.
[00:51:14.683 --> 00:51:15.466]  We got grapefruit.
[00:51:16.405 --> 00:51:23.330]  To defend ourselves, I sell really great products at very affordable prices to show you like them, and you use them, and you want to order them more.
[00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:28.434]  I don't think like a globalist I treat you how I want to be treated, and you treat me like that, and I love you.
[00:51:28.474 --> 00:51:29.075]  You're awesome.
[00:51:29.395 --> 00:51:40.023]  It is such a pleasure that they want to destroy us, and they can't because you support us, and you pray for us, and you spread the articles, and you buy the products, and you just absolutely are committed.
[00:51:41.024 --> 00:51:41.745]  Oh, you're awesome.
[00:51:41.805 --> 00:51:46.008]  It's just unbelievable how we rub at their faces and how our will's stronger than theirs.
[00:51:51.014 --> 00:51:59.047]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had to end the super male vitality, super female vitality, uh, the X2 and the, uh, brain force because...
[00:52:00.546 --> 00:52:01.247]  They're selling out.
[00:52:01.667 --> 00:52:05.590]  And I don't like to just do discounts so good that we're sold out for a month or two before more comes in.
[00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:06.770]  There's a limited supply left.
[00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.872]  Sign up for auto shipping additional 10% off.
[00:52:08.912 --> 00:52:11.454]  But now, we only do this a few times a year.

[00:52:13.675 --> 00:52:16.217]  It's 24 bucks in stores for the very same coil silver.

[00:53:01.353 --> 00:53:03.314]  ProPure is amazing.
[00:53:03.834 --> 00:53:05.495]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:53:05.875 --> 00:53:07.876]  Alexa Pure Breeze, amazing.
[00:53:08.256 --> 00:53:10.317]  Air filtration system, comparable units are $400.
[00:53:10.377 --> 00:53:12.258]  They were like $1,000 a few years ago.
[00:53:12.278 --> 00:53:12.998]  They're all getting cheaper.
[00:53:13.258 --> 00:53:14.679]  There's a miniaturization of technology.
[00:53:15.039 --> 00:53:16.600]  But $200 is a great deal.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.762]  $149.96, 25% off retail.

[00:53:51.341 --> 00:53:52.362]  Savage the enemy!

[00:53:53.403 --> 00:53:54.383]  Break their spirit!
[00:53:54.584 --> 00:53:55.364]  Never give up!

[00:53:58.886 --> 00:53:59.307]  Yes!
[00:54:15.254 --> 00:54:29.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here co-hosting with David Naughty's Riding Shotgun with me, Leanne McAdoo.
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.161]  She's going to be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:32.181 --> 00:54:39.044]  I intend to also open the phones up some to specifically talk to listeners about what do we do?
[00:54:39.984 --> 00:54:43.806]  What do we do when we have... because I really want to get people focused on this.
[00:54:45.029 --> 00:54:51.236]  What do we do when they're openly shopping a coup against the president, openly selling how it's normal, how it's the right thing to do?
[00:54:51.577 --> 00:54:55.041]  They tried to get rid of the electors and stop him from being seated as president.
[00:54:55.581 --> 00:54:57.744]  The Electoral College, they tried to block his nomination.
[00:54:58.204 --> 00:54:59.686]  They stole the nomination from Sanders.
[00:54:59.706 --> 00:55:00.587]  Sanders didn't fight it.
[00:55:00.627 --> 00:55:01.127]  Trump did.
[00:55:01.588 --> 00:55:02.049]  He's a fighter.
[00:55:03.191 --> 00:55:04.911]  And now we all asked him to go there.
[00:55:04.991 --> 00:55:05.812]  We asked him to do this.
[00:55:05.852 --> 00:55:06.832]  He killed TPP.
[00:55:07.332 --> 00:55:08.412]  He's worth it just for that.
[00:55:09.192 --> 00:55:10.193]  Killed the carbon tax.
[00:55:10.773 --> 00:55:12.233]  Three plus trillion in the stock market.
[00:55:12.273 --> 00:55:14.374]  I'm not going to go over all the stuff he's done.
[00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:16.154]  69% reduction in illegals coming across.
[00:55:17.454 --> 00:55:18.915]  The morale of the military going back up.
[00:55:19.195 --> 00:55:20.375]  Trying to reorganize the VA.
[00:55:20.435 --> 00:55:21.475]  Actually doing something.
[00:55:22.395 --> 00:55:23.376]  Trying to get tax cuts.
[00:55:23.396 --> 00:55:24.316]  Trying to kill Obamacare.
[00:55:24.336 --> 00:55:27.737]  Acting like it's his fault he hadn't got rid of it in six months when they're the ones that wrote it.
[00:55:28.017 --> 00:55:28.977]  Took him two years to pass it.
[00:55:29.966 --> 00:55:31.267]  Of course the Republicans are the problem.
[00:55:31.287 --> 00:55:33.568]  That's why I keep telling the idiot Democrats, you gotta love Trump.
[00:55:33.588 --> 00:55:37.029]  If you don't like Republican establishment, Trump's a wrecking ball to these people.
[00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:43.492]  Those are facts though, not getting your news from the nightly comedy shows that are really government psyops.
[00:55:45.233 --> 00:55:50.395]  They admit in variety that the big PR foundations, that's who they are.
[00:55:50.756 --> 00:55:56.018]  Bunch of blue bloods who want to act powerful so they've all got little CIA name key cards and stuff.
[00:55:56.878 --> 00:55:57.939]  They all write that crap.
[00:55:59.175 --> 00:56:00.396]  For the nightly comedy shows.
[00:56:00.456 --> 00:56:01.096]  And then what is it?
[00:56:01.216 --> 00:56:02.137]  Oh, let's kill the president.
[00:56:02.177 --> 00:56:03.117]  Oh, let's get Alex Jones.
[00:56:03.638 --> 00:56:04.618]  Oh, Alex Jones, this and that.
[00:56:05.038 --> 00:56:05.879]  They're the enemy.
[00:56:05.939 --> 00:56:06.699]  They hate you.
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.722]  So, bottom line, what do we do?
[00:56:10.782 --> 00:56:12.343]  They're openly saying coup.
[00:56:12.603 --> 00:56:13.383]  Of course, Trump.
[00:56:13.724 --> 00:56:14.844]  I finally agree with Lindsey Graham.
[00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:18.006]  It makes Trump look weak to try to get Sessions to quit.
[00:56:18.667 --> 00:56:19.467]  He needs a firing.
[00:56:21.808 --> 00:56:22.289]  I'm sorry.
[00:56:22.369 --> 00:56:23.850]  We need someone that will go after them.
[00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:27.452]  They're openly shopping a coup and killing the president.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:29.621]  It's over, okay?
[00:56:30.302 --> 00:56:32.744]  I don't want all this to happen, but they're about to start a civil war.
[00:56:33.424 --> 00:56:34.945]  They're the ones that want to destabilize things.
[00:56:35.606 --> 00:56:38.848]  They're the ones that keep pushing and pushing and are funding all these cop-killing groups.
[00:56:39.409 --> 00:56:40.510]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:43.052]  David, I'm going to let you go get back and get your research going.
[00:56:43.072 --> 00:56:44.193]  It's going to be hosted in the third hour.
[00:56:44.213 --> 00:56:45.974]  Again, I'm here on a workcation.
[00:56:45.994 --> 00:56:47.275]  I'm going to go out and check out some things here.
[00:56:47.295 --> 00:56:48.716]  I've already been out to the missile range.
[00:56:48.756 --> 00:56:50.317]  We're going to air that tomorrow.
[00:56:51.238 --> 00:56:53.839]  The ICBM base, also the missile interceptor base.
[00:56:53.859 --> 00:56:56.660]  But just briefly, I want you to speak to this some of the third hour when you come on.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:02.223]  I really want to get a report from you before we play the Spencer Pratt, Heidi Montag interview.
[00:57:02.943 --> 00:57:05.264]  People ask, why would I do that with the quote, has-beens, whatever.
[00:57:05.564 --> 00:57:07.445]  The whole point is it's about how reality TV's fake.
[00:57:07.765 --> 00:57:08.786]  It's how it's all a joke.
[00:57:09.066 --> 00:57:10.947]  It's how when they came on my show, they got blackballed.
[00:57:11.607 --> 00:57:13.528]  It's inside the whole fake system.
[00:57:14.574 --> 00:57:16.876]  Okay, that's the, that's, we don't care about celebrities.
[00:57:17.116 --> 00:57:17.737]  We said that all day.
[00:57:17.797 --> 00:57:18.497]  I ran into them.
[00:57:18.878 --> 00:57:21.140]  They got destroyed after they were on my show, admittedly.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.542]  And so it's, it's, it's interesting to talk to them.
[00:57:24.202 --> 00:57:25.784]  I think Spencer's kind of a ding dong.
[00:57:25.844 --> 00:57:26.684]  We haven't been hanging out.
[00:57:26.724 --> 00:57:27.505]  It's not a bromance.
[00:57:27.825 --> 00:57:29.427]  Like the media says, I think he's a funny guy.
[00:57:29.447 --> 00:57:31.248]  I think his wife's probably actually a nice lady.
[00:57:31.709 --> 00:57:32.769]  But the point is, is that
[00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:34.331]  That's what's going on.
[00:57:34.351 --> 00:57:36.232]  I'm not going to let the media misrepresent what's happening, though.
[00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:37.132]  It's a pretty powerful interview.
[00:57:37.452 --> 00:57:42.516]  But David, just briefly, I want you to really cogitate on this and come back in an hour when I'm gone, an hour and ten minutes.
[00:57:43.056 --> 00:57:44.597]  What do we do to raise the alarm?
[00:57:44.637 --> 00:57:45.457]  This is a big deal.
[00:57:45.717 --> 00:57:48.459]  They're openly now confirming everything I've told people.
[00:57:48.659 --> 00:57:49.680]  I'm not happy about that.
[00:57:50.506 --> 00:57:57.809]  Well Alex, you know what, when they're talking about, and these are the headlines that we've got coming out from NPR and everything, go ahead psychiatrist, diagnose Donald Trump.
[00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:10.615]  As you pointed out, they're preparing the groundwork, and they're coming out, it's predictive programming for them, or trying to move the Overton window here, so people are going to accept some kind of an action against Donald Trump.
[00:58:11.075 --> 00:58:17.698]  What I think Donald Trump needs to do is, I think he needs to have more of these public meetings that we saw a couple of these just this last week again.
[00:58:17.938 --> 00:58:21.042]  He goes out, and he addresses tens of thousands of people.
[00:58:21.322 --> 00:58:22.384]  That's unprecedented.
[00:58:22.824 --> 00:58:26.109]  And they can see, then, that the American public supports him.
[00:58:26.209 --> 00:58:31.856]  And I think he also, though, needs to talk about his agenda and put pressure on those sellout Republicans at the same time.
[00:58:31.916 --> 00:58:33.138]  Gee, David, you just said it.
[00:58:33.238 --> 00:58:33.919]  You just said it.
[00:58:34.259 --> 00:58:34.479]  Boom.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.722]  He's got to go public with all this.
[00:58:36.842 --> 00:58:39.404]  He's got to rally the people and say he needs the support.
[00:58:39.724 --> 00:58:42.366]  He's got to admit how much danger he's in and we're all in.
[00:58:42.386 --> 00:58:43.347]  I didn't even plug this hour.
[00:58:43.567 --> 00:58:44.889]  Free shipping ends in a couple days.

[01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:17.831]  Big Brother.
[01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:19.452]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:20.012 --> 01:00:21.032]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.972 --> 01:00:23.353]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:23.613 --> 01:00:24.793]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:25.253 --> 01:00:33.076]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:40.578]  We are at such an amazing historic crossroads that I basically have got goosebumps 24 hours a day.
[01:00:40.598 --> 01:00:41.378]  At least when I'm awake.
[01:00:42.955 --> 01:00:44.916]  This is an unprecedented time to be alive.
[01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:54.560]  We now have the former head of the CIA, the same one that told Trump to watch his mouth, saying that they're preparing a coup, an overthrow of the president.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:57.701]  You have major publications saying the preparations have been made.
[01:00:58.302 --> 01:01:02.103]  Financial Times of London, Atlantic Monthly, you name it.
[01:01:02.163 --> 01:01:07.265]  You have Time and Newsweek and others calling for the president to be assassinated.
[01:01:07.866 --> 01:01:08.326]  You've got
[01:01:09.679 --> 01:01:15.721]  Newsweek last week calling for my arrest, saying why hasn't Alex Jones been arrested yet?
[01:01:16.041 --> 01:01:17.882]  He's calling for violence, when I'm not.
[01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:20.723]  They're desperate because I know they're rats.
[01:01:21.063 --> 01:01:21.884]  I know they're filth.
[01:01:22.664 --> 01:01:23.524]  I know they're scum.
[01:01:24.745 --> 01:01:26.765]  I just hosted the whole last hour and didn't plug.
[01:01:28.026 --> 01:01:34.288]  Because I get so focused on exposing this, but a critical part of this is realizing historically where we are and what's happening.
[01:01:34.769 --> 01:01:35.769]  Now Al Gore's come out.
[01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:40.013]  On the Late Late Show instead of big events coming basically to remove Trump.
[01:01:40.033 --> 01:01:41.054]  Everybody has to get ready for it.
[01:01:43.097 --> 01:01:44.298]  Because they can't impeach him.
[01:01:44.318 --> 01:01:45.139]  They don't have the numbers.
[01:01:45.479 --> 01:01:46.781]  He has the American people's support.
[01:01:46.801 --> 01:01:47.601]  He's got to go public.
[01:01:47.902 --> 01:01:49.283]  He's got to get out in more rallies.
[01:01:49.704 --> 01:01:51.426]  He's got to point out not just fake news.
[01:01:53.490 --> 01:02:05.017]  But he's got to point out to everybody that the deep state is making its move against the American people to overthrow our will and to break our will, as I've said, and now as Lou Dobbs and Colonel Schaefer and many others have said.
[01:02:05.618 --> 01:02:13.263]  It is on, it is happening, this is real, and we have to raise the alarm, just like Pastor Brown, who met with a senior member of Congress.
[01:02:15.504 --> 01:02:24.188]  Last week, who said yes, they're preparing martial law on the hill, they're going around getting everybody ready for it, saying you better get in line and accept it or we'll come after you.
[01:02:24.588 --> 01:02:27.850]  Well, the answer to that is politically, fill your hand.
[01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.011]  You want it, you're going to get it.
[01:02:30.411 --> 01:02:31.332]  I'm not backing off.
[01:02:31.452 --> 01:02:33.773]  I'm going to full ramming speed with these people.
[01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.954]  I can't wait to bang heads with them.
[01:02:37.435 --> 01:02:43.918]  And as long as you realize that you don't have any future unless you stand up to these people, and unless you say no to them,
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.221]  Unless you realize that we have no future.
[01:02:47.542 --> 01:02:51.245]  Because they're a joke, it's an illusion, it's a spell, it's a fraud.
[01:02:52.446 --> 01:02:57.651]  Now that said, every article, every video, but especially these articles and videos we've been breaking down.
[01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:05.759]  Dealing with the martial law, civil war, assassination, removal, sudden removal, coup of Trump.
[01:03:06.299 --> 01:03:08.181]  All of this is now confirmed.
[01:03:08.501 --> 01:03:11.344]  Talk about sensationally fantastic.
[01:03:12.745 --> 01:03:14.426]  Talk about living in incredible times.
[01:03:14.506 --> 01:03:17.748]  Talk about America and the world at the crossroads.
[01:03:17.788 --> 01:03:18.308]  This is it.
[01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:21.910]  And now more than ever, we need your financial support.
[01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:23.931]  We have the very best products you need.
[01:03:24.332 --> 01:03:27.293]  Incredible air filtration systems that at $219, similar units are $400, $600.
[01:03:27.393 --> 01:03:30.475]  Used to be like $800 a few years ago.
[01:03:30.495 --> 01:03:31.196]  The prices are going down.
[01:03:31.216 --> 01:03:31.696]  They're $149 right now.
[01:03:40.195 --> 01:03:41.136]  $149, normally $219.
[01:03:41.236 --> 01:03:44.337]  That is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:03:44.797 --> 01:03:48.538]  The very same type systems, again, are $400 on average, upwards of $600.
[01:03:48.819 --> 01:03:53.000]  Pro Pure Traveler, the very best gravity-fed systems out there, 30% off, $132.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.321]  The other competitors aren't even as good.
[01:03:57.742 --> 01:03:59.123]  And they sell them for $200, $230.
[01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:01.264]  That's $132 right now.
[01:04:01.864 --> 01:04:05.926]  Super Silver Special, the electric toothbrush that has silver impregnated in it, amazing.
[01:04:06.987 --> 01:04:09.848]  And the Cloydal Silver toothpaste, super blue.
[01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:14.211]  And the Silver Bullet Cloydal Silver, 50% off.
[01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:15.531]  We've never done a special that big.
[01:04:15.872 --> 01:04:17.252]  Caveman Combo, 25% off the bone broth.
[01:04:19.198 --> 01:04:21.439]  Super female, 57% off.
[01:04:21.479 --> 01:04:22.139]  And why is that?
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.661]  Because we're basically sold out of the super male.
[01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:25.701]  I can't discount that.
[01:04:26.001 --> 01:04:28.803]  Super female is very, very similar and works on men as well.
[01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:29.683]  But I want women.
[01:04:29.703 --> 01:04:31.644]  It's never really caught on with women for some reason.
[01:04:31.664 --> 01:04:32.104]  It should.
[01:04:32.705 --> 01:04:35.466]  It's even more dramatic from what I've seen in women, when it comes to libido at least.
[01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:37.747]  But stamina, energy, just read the reviews.
[01:04:38.528 --> 01:04:39.388]  Super female, 57% off.
[01:04:41.249 --> 01:04:42.611]  And so many other big specials.
[01:04:42.651 --> 01:04:43.832]  DNA 4 is 20% off.
[01:04:44.152 --> 01:04:46.114]  Free shipping until the end of this month.
[01:04:46.335 --> 01:04:49.899]  That's only a few more days and the huge sales of July are over.
[01:04:50.159 --> 01:04:56.506]  Please support the broadcast, support yourself, and help fund the InfoWar in the face of this unprecedented assault because we're having victory.
[01:04:57.107 --> 01:04:59.109]  InfoWarStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:04:59.129 --> 01:04:59.710]  Thanks for your support.
[01:05:04.292 --> 01:05:16.426]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[01:05:16.606 --> 01:05:23.975]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWars Life family, true whey protein from InfoWars Life.
[01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:30.236]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high-quality organic conditions.
[01:05:30.796 --> 01:05:37.537]  Our True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life contains a whopping 20 grams of protein per serving.
[01:05:37.977 --> 01:05:45.199]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:53.380]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies to bring you a super
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:58.002]  High-quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[01:05:58.523 --> 01:06:06.087]  That way you get the benefits and the taste of high-quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[01:06:06.407 --> 01:06:08.889]  Doing our research, one thing continued to really stand out.
[01:06:09.469 --> 01:06:18.137]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[01:06:18.538 --> 01:06:19.358]  That is essential.
[01:06:19.739 --> 01:06:24.043]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[01:06:24.543 --> 01:06:26.965]  This is the very best whey that we were able to bring to market.
[01:06:27.346 --> 01:06:29.047]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[01:06:29.147 --> 01:06:30.789]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.
[01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:33.852]  It is true whey from mfoolwarslive.com.
[01:06:34.232 --> 01:06:41.117]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:51.123]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken, and it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[01:06:51.163 --> 01:06:54.165]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[01:06:54.405 --> 01:06:55.626]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[01:06:56.047 --> 01:07:03.532]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:04.272 --> 01:07:12.954]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:07:13.035 --> 01:07:13.495]  That's right.
[01:07:13.555 --> 01:07:18.556]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.
[01:07:18.816 --> 01:07:25.238]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[01:07:25.498 --> 01:07:32.785]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:07:33.085 --> 01:07:33.265]  Woo!
[01:07:33.325 --> 01:07:34.246]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:34.366 --> 01:07:42.973]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:07:43.114 --> 01:07:51.221]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:07:52.682 --> 01:07:56.023]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:07:56.123 --> 01:08:00.085]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:08:00.245 --> 01:08:01.165]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:08:01.305 --> 01:08:03.966]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:08:11.389 --> 01:08:17.612]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:35.813]  Ladies and gentlemen, Leanne McAdoo is going to be riding shotgun with me.
[01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:50.624]  She's in Florida, I'm in Hawaii, and again I chose to do a family vacation, a workcation here in Hawaii, because Zuckerberg and hundreds of other top elite have been moving to Kauai, the further most westerly
[01:08:51.744 --> 01:08:57.888]  Part of the United States of America, just 4,400 miles to the west of me.
[01:08:58.688 --> 01:09:03.932]  I guess the east really begins, and you've got North Korea with its missiles aimed at the United States.
[01:09:03.952 --> 01:09:08.695]  I went and shot a report there at the missile range that we're going to be airing here on the broadcast tomorrow.
[01:09:09.295 --> 01:09:15.139]  Coming up the next hour, I did a 30-minute in-depth interview with Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag.
[01:09:16.039 --> 01:09:21.242]  Of course, who had several hit reality TV shows and were some of the most hated people in America.
[01:09:21.742 --> 01:09:24.543]  And I've always talked about the fact that I don't care about celebrities.
[01:09:24.563 --> 01:09:26.164]  We don't seek out celebrities for the show.
[01:09:27.284 --> 01:09:28.745]  I've turned down pretty big movie roles.
[01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:29.285]  I'm not bragging.
[01:09:29.325 --> 01:09:29.926]  It's just a fact.
[01:09:30.406 --> 01:09:32.167]  I've turned down a bunch of reality TV shows.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.822]  I was offered Ventura's show when he got sick of doing it because they wanted him to do chupacabras and space aliens.
[01:09:38.842 --> 01:09:40.562]  I mean, I wouldn't do it either.
[01:09:40.602 --> 01:09:42.363]  They couldn't believe when I wasn't interested.
[01:09:42.383 --> 01:09:48.424]  But I've been offered a lot of other shows and I'm proud of the fact I've said no because they get you to basically do things you wouldn't normally do.
[01:09:49.345 --> 01:09:52.285]  And reality TV is not really reality TV.
[01:09:53.446 --> 01:09:54.746]  In fact, I asked Spencer about that.
[01:09:54.786 --> 01:09:57.247]  I said, are there any reality TV shows that are really reality TV?
[01:09:57.287 --> 01:09:58.567]  And he said, yeah, cops.
[01:09:59.427 --> 01:10:01.128]  And those are real calls and real criminals.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.623]  But still, I guarantee you, stuff that embarrasses cops, they're not putting in there.
[01:10:06.643 --> 01:10:08.865]  You can believe that's been sanitized as well.
[01:10:09.846 --> 01:10:11.027]  I can tell you, this is reality.
[01:10:11.788 --> 01:10:12.849]  There's no teleprompters here.
[01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:13.709]  Our guests are real.
[01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:15.291]  We don't screen your calls.
[01:10:15.331 --> 01:10:16.892]  We don't stage anything.
[01:10:16.932 --> 01:10:17.833]  This is real.
[01:10:18.413 --> 01:10:23.298]  Fast moving, on target, seat of our pants, resistance to the globalists.
[01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:38.652]  And that's why when I tell you there's a planned overthrow of the President, and then you start seeing it in major elite publications, and now you got Al Gore, you got Brennan, the former head of the CIA, all up on TV saying the President is about to be removed in the next few months, a big event's coming.
[01:10:39.793 --> 01:10:47.796]  I told you about three weeks ago, the phone calls are going on to people saying, listen, sorry, Trump's going to be taken out.
[01:10:48.736 --> 01:10:51.057]  That's the way it is, and you better get in line.
[01:10:52.267 --> 01:10:53.708]  We care about you, Alex.
[01:10:54.468 --> 01:10:55.869]  You need to be in there for the long haul.
[01:10:55.909 --> 01:10:59.731]  You need to not be too extreme if something happens to the President.
[01:11:00.831 --> 01:11:02.892]  And again, it's not said even all conspiratorial.
[01:11:02.932 --> 01:11:04.713]  It's said as a friendly thing.
[01:11:05.073 --> 01:11:06.634]  How's your family doing?
[01:11:07.414 --> 01:11:07.995]  How are your children?
[01:11:08.035 --> 01:11:08.595]  How's your health?
[01:11:10.996 --> 01:11:12.157]  Because we're really worried about your health.
[01:11:12.657 --> 01:11:14.058]  I've had five or six of those phone calls.
[01:11:15.806 --> 01:11:20.892]  And really, that's other people hedging their bets so that groups listening to them think that they're on board.
[01:11:21.413 --> 01:11:23.035]  But really, most people aren't on board.
[01:11:24.957 --> 01:11:27.500]  The people are playing along like they're on board.
[01:11:28.174 --> 01:11:31.035]  And it's all a big psy-op that everybody intimidated.
[01:11:31.215 --> 01:11:32.536]  And they've done that to my crew.
[01:11:32.916 --> 01:11:34.076]  They've done that to my office.
[01:11:34.476 --> 01:11:36.237]  Or they call up my crew and they spook them out.
[01:11:36.297 --> 01:11:38.518]  And Alex is going to get SWAT teamed next week.
[01:11:38.558 --> 01:11:41.159]  Or Alex is going to get raided by this next week or next month.
[01:11:41.199 --> 01:11:41.899]  It never happens.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:51.283]  But the people that get freaked out by that and get psy-opped, they never admit that they were wrong for the psy-op.
[01:11:51.643 --> 01:11:53.944]  Just like people that buy into Nigerian phone scams.
[01:11:56.570 --> 01:12:02.053]  And, you know, send $2,000 to the Nigerian Prince, and then he wants $20,000, because they're going to get their million.
[01:12:02.633 --> 01:12:04.354]  They never admit it was a con game.
[01:12:04.534 --> 01:12:08.556]  Always, oh, Prince Obubu, there was a coup, or he got locked up.
[01:12:08.817 --> 01:12:15.140]  And then they even stay in contact with the Nigerian scammers on the phone, and sometimes get scammed again.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.321]  And you can't help them.
[01:12:18.322 --> 01:12:22.264]  Just like CNN has new polls out that they admit are fake, and they're, and they're
[01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:31.036]  System how they carry it out in their methodology Some CNN polls have 30 plus percent points added for Hillary.
[01:12:31.397 --> 01:12:48.068]  Well now they're saying Oh Trump's upside down in almost all the states that were purple like Pennsylvania the states where he was you know, you know only behind 10 points when he won he was behind the day you won in the polls and
[01:12:50.418 --> 01:12:54.240]  But notice, they didn't use all the fake polls for five, six months, because they knew you remembered them.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.181]  Now they've come back with the fake polls.
[01:12:56.382 --> 01:12:57.322]  Kind of like Brian Williams.
[01:12:57.862 --> 01:13:06.828]  A year after he gets caught doing fake news, saying he was shot down by an RPG in a helicopter, he's back doing exposés on me on fake news!
[01:13:07.608 --> 01:13:10.710]  And then saying things I never said, playing edited clips.
[01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:11.911]  The king of fake news.
[01:13:12.251 --> 01:13:13.932]  The standard of fake news.
[01:13:15.873 --> 01:13:17.574]  Katie Couric got caught editing interviews.
[01:13:17.614 --> 01:13:18.355]  Got sued over it.
[01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:21.968]  Editing them deceptively, make people look dumb.
[01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:26.849]  And then, did she stop?
[01:13:26.909 --> 01:13:27.950]  No, she still does all that.
[01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:30.850]  Did it stop Megyn Kelly even though she knew I was probably recording her?
[01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:31.531]  No, she didn't care.
[01:13:32.851 --> 01:13:36.932]  She did it stuff 20 minutes apart, an hour apart, totally different subjects.
[01:13:40.152 --> 01:13:42.533]  I said on the video, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[01:13:46.328 --> 01:13:48.950]  Just to end their whole propaganda operation.
[01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:53.352]  And they wouldn't, I knew it too, they wouldn't put it in the show.
[01:13:53.372 --> 01:13:58.255]  Because they want to continue that narrative that they think they're beating me over the head with.
[01:13:58.315 --> 01:13:59.796]  But you get to hear the audio.
[01:14:02.898 --> 01:14:04.659]  And her viewership continues to plunge.
[01:14:04.699 --> 01:14:07.260]  In her key demographics, she's less than 2 million.
[01:14:07.941 --> 01:14:09.322]  In the other demographic, it's about a million.
[01:14:09.342 --> 01:14:10.782]  But she's down to 3 million.
[01:14:11.563 --> 01:14:13.324]  Before she took the show over, it was at 10 million.
[01:14:14.804 --> 01:14:17.566]  But they got Huffington Post articles yesterday saying, I got it all wrong.
[01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:24.972]  They had Huffington Post articles saying, Jones is wrong about her ratings plunge.
[01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:28.815]  When she took over, it was 6 million and she still has 3 million.
[01:14:29.115 --> 01:14:30.116]  No, look at those demographics.
[01:14:30.776 --> 01:14:33.258]  A few months before she took it over, it was at 10 million.
[01:14:33.679 --> 01:14:35.540]  Then she takes it over, it's at 6 million.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:40.464]  Yeah, it drops from the shows before, when she first comes on, it drops from 10 to 6.
[01:14:41.425 --> 01:14:42.686]  But they're saying when she started,
[01:14:43.797 --> 01:14:45.338]  You only measure the drop from there down.
[01:14:45.378 --> 01:14:47.259]  But no, when she came on, people tuned out.
[01:14:47.279 --> 01:14:49.059]  You have to count the first show.
[01:14:49.079 --> 01:14:56.623]  It goes from 10 million to 6.7 or whatever it was, down to now 2 million in her key demographics.
[01:14:57.023 --> 01:14:58.444]  Add all the others together, maybe 3 million.
[01:14:58.904 --> 01:15:00.305]  And then they act like I'm lying.
[01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:03.786]  Oh, Jones put out fake news in his latest attack on Megyn Kelly.
[01:15:07.108 --> 01:15:07.688]  See how it works?
[01:15:08.869 --> 01:15:10.169]  Yeah, she got just 2.71 million total viewers.
[01:15:13.544 --> 01:15:18.926]  But there's an article in the Huffington Post yesterday saying, I'm a liar, she didn't drop to two million.
[01:15:23.787 --> 01:15:24.607]  Yeah, yeah she did.
[01:15:25.547 --> 01:15:28.268]  But see, you don't care, you just want to say, I'm a liar.
[01:15:29.168 --> 01:15:31.149]  And then hope everybody reads that and feels good about it.
[01:15:31.369 --> 01:15:32.189]  But it's not working.
[01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:41.552]  Now they've announced a new Comedy Central show, five nights a week, where the host poses as me, and then says racist things, and then says he's Alex Jones.
[01:15:43.336 --> 01:15:44.156]  It doesn't work.
[01:15:44.276 --> 01:15:45.717]  People know they're liars.
[01:15:47.438 --> 01:15:50.579]  Leanne McAdoo, co-hosting with us.
[01:15:51.399 --> 01:15:53.140]  I want to get into a host of issues here with her.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.581]  I also want to talk about the movie Dunkirk.
[01:15:56.961 --> 01:16:00.443]  A week ago, there was big headlines, the top movie in the country, great reviews.
[01:16:01.983 --> 01:16:05.305]  The British Expeditionary Force, a true story, being attacked by the Luftwaffe.
[01:16:07.005 --> 01:16:08.866]  Now they're Nazis by alchemy.
[01:16:10.467 --> 01:16:11.007]  Because
[01:16:12.213 --> 01:16:17.197]  And this is in USA Today, Associated Press, because there's no black people.
[01:16:17.257 --> 01:16:28.144]  Well, the British Expeditionary Force, people were white in England then, and the British Expeditionary Force, other than maybe 1% Sikh and another 1% Indian, was 98% white.
[01:16:28.204 --> 01:16:32.387]  That's the numbers according to the British Defense Ministry in 1943.
[01:16:35.743 --> 01:16:38.424]  in Operation Overlord and D-Day.
[01:16:38.905 --> 01:16:50.851]  But they're saying it's racist because there's no black people or women in the invasion force or in the whole Dunkirk operation fleeing previous to D-Day.
[01:16:51.631 --> 01:16:53.733]  This of course happened in 1941.
[01:16:55.233 --> 01:16:59.696]  So, it's now completely racist, ladies and gentlemen, if in
[01:17:00.939 --> 01:17:05.740]  Dunkirk and the and the expeditionary force evacuating years before D-Day.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.061]  Because there's new movies out about D-Day that are coming out soon.
[01:17:09.081 --> 01:17:10.521]  They're saying those are racist too.
[01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:11.621]  So I'm kind of conflated the two issues.
[01:17:11.841 --> 01:17:12.801]  The point is it gets crazier.
[01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:25.004]  Paul Watson put an article out a few days ago where in the new BBC cartoons for kids it shows the typical British Roman family of 2,000 years ago and they're black.
[01:17:27.025 --> 01:17:35.933]  And of course, archaeologists say that England was 99.9% white, was maybe 2% Roman at the time, but they were white.
[01:17:36.194 --> 01:17:41.338]  And the point is, it's okay if Africa was black 2,000 years ago.
[01:17:41.679 --> 01:17:43.160]  And it's okay if England was white.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.724]  But they're rewriting history and they admit it's xenophobic not to show Brits as
[01:17:48.843 --> 01:17:49.223]  Black.
[01:17:49.903 --> 01:17:56.406]  And now if you show Dunkirk, a historical thing that happened, and the people aren't, quote, minorities, then it's racist.
[01:17:56.446 --> 01:18:00.907]  So this is the total war on reality, the war on history, the war on everything.
[01:18:00.947 --> 01:18:02.428]  And it's not being pushed by black people.
[01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:05.789]  It's being pushed by the BBC and social engineers.
[01:18:06.529 --> 01:18:10.171]  But like the BBC announced four years ago, there's a hiring freeze on anybody who's white.
[01:18:11.511 --> 01:18:15.953]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, the history now of Dunkirk
[01:18:16.894 --> 01:18:21.996]  And people fleeing the Nazis, the British Expeditionary Force, that is now racist.
[01:18:22.036 --> 01:18:26.358]  So by alchemy, people being killed by Nazis, they're now the Nazis.
[01:18:26.658 --> 01:18:28.119]  Leanne McAdoo, great to have you with us.
[01:18:29.172 --> 01:18:30.312]  It's great being here, Alex.
[01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:34.653]  It's just, who needs accuracy when you're trying to give historical context?
[01:18:35.113 --> 01:18:49.036]  I mean, we can just see this massive push to rewrite history and to, no wonder everyone is going mad these days when you have jackasses over at Comedy Central trying to say that the independent media is the problem.
[01:18:49.136 --> 01:18:54.357]  Oh, it's 2017 and we've got this independent media trying to give people their fake news.
[01:18:54.817 --> 01:19:09.352]  When we have literally, over and over again, exposed the establishment media as pushing fake news or, like I want to get into in the next segment, refusing to even talk about real news, huge issues, because it's going to rock the Democrats.
[01:19:09.633 --> 01:19:15.319]  So they're just going to ignore these stories altogether, but then have their tagline be, democracy dies in darkness.
[01:19:15.839 --> 01:19:27.597]  So this is just really incredible what we're witnessing, just this total rewrite of history, and then to call anyone who calls them out on their inaccuracy racist, Nazis, what have you.
[01:19:29.093 --> 01:19:33.797]  Well, I'm not taking anything away from North Africa or the history there.
[01:19:34.357 --> 01:19:41.483]  But the Greek historians said that the first civilizations in Egypt were European.
[01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:43.565]  And now they've done the DNA testing and they weren't.
[01:19:43.865 --> 01:19:48.449]  Now, later, sub-Saharan Africans came into Egypt and that's what it phased into.
[01:19:48.469 --> 01:19:51.932]  But it's not an attack on anybody that, oh, Plato was right.
[01:19:52.172 --> 01:19:53.093]  Wow, he lived back then.
[01:19:53.633 --> 01:19:59.076]  2,300 years ago, the first half of Egyptian history was blonde-haired, blue-eyed people.
[01:20:00.017 --> 01:20:02.818]  It's like saying the Greeks were once blonde-haired, blue-eyed.
[01:20:03.699 --> 01:20:12.243]  Of the 30-plus proprietary products that we've developed for Infowarslife.com, which are all amazing, DNA Force is the flagship.
[01:20:12.623 --> 01:20:21.188]  This highly advanced formula has been sold out for close to six months due to a worldwide shortage of the sought-after ingredients.
[01:20:21.528 --> 01:20:38.719]  Today I'm very excited to announce that we have received a limited shipment of DNA Force and despite the fact that we have been sold out for close to six months, I'm still discounting it 20% because I want listeners and viewers that haven't tried DNA Force yet to actually get a chance to see how amazing it is.
[01:20:38.979 --> 01:20:52.705]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systemic enzymes, NaR lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many, many others that synergistically work together.

[01:21:58.706 --> 01:22:01.429]  And again, thank you for making the Infowar possible.
[01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:03.272]  You are the Infowar.
[01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:12.883]  Ruthless offshore elites use their corporate liberal media to attack and demonize any Americans or any independent news that dare challenge their lives.
[01:22:13.504 --> 01:22:15.767]  Five companies own over 90% of the media.
[01:22:17.068 --> 01:22:23.538]  And that's why whether it's comedy shows, award shows, Hollywood, TV entertainment, the news, it doesn't matter.
[01:22:23.878 --> 01:22:31.930]  It's all focused in one anti-American, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-gun voice.
[01:22:32.711 --> 01:22:33.431]  And it gets worse.
[01:22:33.791 --> 01:22:44.935]  These ruthless social engineers have an iron grip on our educational system and are teaching our children to hate America and that our president is worse than Hitler and needs to be assassinated.
[01:22:45.355 --> 01:22:52.418]  But as America reawakens, these powerful, deep state, rogue government forces are beginning to panic.
[01:22:53.118 --> 01:23:05.467]  They've even got the former president on television and in the news, and traveling to foreign countries, bad-mouthing America, bad-mouthing sovereignty, and calling for resistance to our elected president.
[01:23:05.968 --> 01:23:17.877]  In a last-ditch effort, mainstream media is now legitimizing the use of violence against anyone that opposes the globalist takeover, and against anyone who's actually trying to make this nation great again.
[01:23:18.397 --> 01:23:30.711]  They are absolutely intensifying their efforts, screaming homophobe, xenophobe, racist, to make them march, to make them go out on the streets and assault viciously anyone trying to exercise their free speech.
[01:23:31.231 --> 01:23:39.040]  International criminals like George Soros are openly pushing for civil insurrection in America that will lead to civil war.
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:46.482]  The beatings, the stabbings, the shootings, the burning cars, the looting of shops, the execution of police officers.
[01:23:47.103 --> 01:23:57.306]  All of this leads to the destabilization, to the martial law that the deep state and the globalists say they need to bring in their final takeover of America.
[01:23:57.986 --> 01:24:02.188]  We are America, and we are the Infowar.
[01:24:21.242 --> 01:24:21.722]  Okay.
[01:24:23.383 --> 01:24:25.604]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:24:26.224 --> 01:24:27.265]  We are back live again.
[01:24:27.305 --> 01:24:28.225]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:24:28.245 --> 01:24:30.546]  Leon McAdoo is riding shotgun with us.
[01:24:31.486 --> 01:24:32.887]  We've got some really disturbing news.
[01:24:32.927 --> 01:24:40.770]  One of the sons of G. Gordon Liddy, who's a Deputy Attorney General in California, has been charged with having child pornography.
[01:24:40.810 --> 01:24:43.832]  Now, I can tell you that just Operation Playpen
[01:24:44.901 --> 01:24:51.429]  And the whole Playpen dark web website had 150,000 users, many of them in the US.
[01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:55.354]  So that's been part of this big roll up that Trump's been orchestrating.
[01:24:56.475 --> 01:24:59.239]  And I'm going to research everything that's happened.
[01:24:59.259 --> 01:25:00.380]  I'm going to look into this guy.
[01:25:01.261 --> 01:25:19.453]  I'm going to look into what's happening, but when somebody's being busted for having child porn, when you've got old people that actually are with kids, getting caught with them in cages, and then it comes out in the news that they find a bunch of kids in cages in California, and then nothing happens, you don't hear about where the kids went, I ask, what's happening?
[01:25:20.754 --> 01:25:31.216]  So, you know, the big stuff gets covered up, and then constantly, we know at the Pentagon, they would load child porn on the tens of thousands of people's computers to then blackmail them and control them.
[01:25:32.856 --> 01:25:34.116]  So I'm not saying that's what happened here.
[01:25:34.196 --> 01:25:36.517]  It should just be looked at, not because he's G. Gordon Whitty's son.
[01:25:36.537 --> 01:25:39.097]  You know, this fits the pattern.
[01:25:39.117 --> 01:25:42.778]  Another powerful person, you know, who's reportedly involved in all this.
[01:25:42.978 --> 01:25:43.658]  He may be guilty.
[01:25:43.718 --> 01:25:44.158]  I don't know.
[01:25:44.738 --> 01:25:45.878]  I'm just saying we see this pattern.
[01:25:45.898 --> 01:25:48.579]  Now, a big topic Leanne wants to get into, and it's why I like to bring her on.
[01:25:49.537 --> 01:25:52.118]  Because I saw this last night on Infowars.com.
[01:25:52.738 --> 01:25:53.779]  It's a big story.
[01:25:53.879 --> 01:25:55.460]  The Democrats are panicking over it.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:26:01.422]  Democrats panic over IT guy who got caught trying to reportedly flee the country.
[01:26:02.463 --> 01:26:06.344]  Also, the attempted preparation for coup, the leakers, all of it.
[01:26:06.364 --> 01:26:07.465]  So, Leon, let's go over it.
[01:26:08.649 --> 01:26:10.270]  Well, this is just basically a story.
[01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:22.899]  If you ever wanted to know what is a huge story, you just take a look at how it's not being covered, especially by our so-called free and independent, most important press, like the New York Times.
[01:26:22.939 --> 01:26:23.860]  They still have yet
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:32.328]  To report even one article on this House IT scandal that is now getting into months-long investigation.
[01:26:32.388 --> 01:26:34.910]  They still have yet to even report a single article on it.
[01:26:36.031 --> 01:26:37.132]  Same with the Wall Street Journal.
[01:26:37.793 --> 01:26:44.159]  The Daily Caller is reporting that MSNBC, ABC, NBC News, they've given zero on-air coverage to this topic.
[01:26:44.519 --> 01:26:47.181]  CNN, okay, they gave it
[01:26:47.862 --> 01:26:53.568]  A little bit of coverage, just a smidgen, this morning at 6 a.m., on their 6 a.m.
[01:26:53.688 --> 01:26:54.669]  Eastern broadcast.
[01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:57.451]  So they can say, oh, well, we did cover it.
[01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:59.133]  How dare you say the establishment media?
[01:26:59.393 --> 01:27:05.439]  Yeah, everyone in the country is asleep at that time, not paying attention to this huge House IT scandal.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:06.981]  And now check this out.
[01:27:07.281 --> 01:27:08.903]  So we've got the Washington Post.
[01:27:09.543 --> 01:27:12.565]  Who is the, you know, democracy dies in darkness.
[01:27:13.025 --> 01:27:21.969]  They finally gave it a little bit of coverage yesterday and they're only pointing out how this congressional IT staffer has been charged with home equity loan fraud.
[01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:27.953]  Now this is what the FBI was able to stop Imran Awan on from boarding this flight.
[01:27:28.013 --> 01:27:29.834]  They were able to get him on bank fraud.
[01:27:30.114 --> 01:27:38.398]  So this might just be a placeholder charge for some other coming more serious charges, but this is the one thing they had him on back in March.
[01:27:38.558 --> 01:27:48.167]  So we've been talking about all these guys and the people running the congressional servers who are from Pakistan and hooked in with the Democrats and with national security clearances when they didn't have clearances.
[01:27:48.227 --> 01:27:52.271]  Again, everything they say Trump's done, they've done in quadruplicate.
[01:27:52.631 --> 01:27:53.412]  This is crazy.
[01:27:53.492 --> 01:27:54.213]  Segwaying in.
[01:27:54.673 --> 01:28:01.099]  Is it surreal for you, Leanne, to see Al Gore and Brennan and everybody saying, yeah, we're getting ready to take Trump out.
[01:28:01.139 --> 01:28:01.840]  Get ready for it.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:02.901]  It's bipartisan.
[01:28:02.941 --> 01:28:04.222]  Everybody needs to sit down and shut up.
[01:28:05.509 --> 01:28:23.359]  Well, I mean, I think that they're all kind of scrambling because they see when you have the House Judiciary Committee saying they're going to go ahead and approve this effort to investigate Comey and Loretta Lynch and many other House players and look at some of these agreements that they made with Hillary Clinton's top aides to give them immunity.
[01:28:24.159 --> 01:28:26.640]  Get in deeper with this investigation.
[01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:27.741]  That is huge.
[01:28:27.981 --> 01:28:30.502]  This has the potential to take a lot of people down.
[01:28:30.783 --> 01:28:34.945]  So, of course, your big swamp monsters are scrambling.
[01:28:35.225 --> 01:28:38.527]  And they are going to do whatever they can to try and get Trump out.
[01:28:38.807 --> 01:28:45.030]  If it's not by impeachment, it might be by some other surprise, as some people have alluded to.
[01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:47.472]  Something that's going to take him out of office very quickly.
[01:28:49.650 --> 01:28:56.175]  There's a civil war in our country and Trump really does represent the good guys because he's trying to restore common sense.
[01:28:56.215 --> 01:28:57.576]  He's trying to restore prosperity.
[01:28:58.237 --> 01:29:01.739]  And this is really a war between those that are affected by hype and those that aren't.
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:07.584]  But they've got this real whisper campaign going that's now public that they're getting ready to take Trump out and everybody better go along with it.
[01:29:07.864 --> 01:29:12.388]  If you go along with it, they're not just going to take out the president and then leave everybody else alone.
[01:29:12.868 --> 01:29:17.592]  Everybody that plays along, just like in the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks only took Moscow at first.
[01:29:17.612 --> 01:29:19.574]  It took them two years to get outside the city.
[01:29:20.094 --> 01:29:32.785]  But they got the military to turn in their weapons, they got the leadership to do what they were told, and by successive approximation, bluffing everybody, they got the whole country over a few years to then get under their control, and then the Red Terror began.
[01:29:33.065 --> 01:29:34.447]  Let's talk about that straight ahead.
[01:29:34.467 --> 01:29:36.608]  But thank God we got our Second Amendment, folks.
[01:29:37.069 --> 01:29:38.890]  This isn't going to be like what happened to the poor serfs.
[01:29:39.811 --> 01:29:40.972]  At the end of Tsarist Russia.
[01:29:41.732 --> 01:29:51.679]  Because the very same globalist players, the very same New World Order communists, the very same devil-worshipping trash thinks they're gonna have their way with us and they're not.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.181]  On the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.102 --> 01:29:58.784]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.797 --> 01:30:07.319]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:30:07.779 --> 01:30:13.821]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:17.023]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:17.403 --> 01:30:20.404]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:20.604 --> 01:30:24.046]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:30:24.386 --> 01:30:24.846]  The left
[01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:26.127]  ...controls culture.
[01:30:26.167 --> 01:30:27.127]  They control arts.
[01:30:27.207 --> 01:30:28.428]  They control entertainment.
[01:30:28.728 --> 01:30:35.813]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:35.873 --> 01:30:38.274]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:30:38.755 --> 01:30:42.617]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:30:42.677 --> 01:30:44.739]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[01:30:45.359 --> 01:30:50.744]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[01:30:51.004 --> 01:30:57.250]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:30:57.330 --> 01:30:59.032]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:30:59.172 --> 01:31:00.353]  It's available right now.
[01:31:00.673 --> 01:31:02.855]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:03.775 --> 01:31:12.519]  After speaking with his military staff, President Trump has banned transgenders from the military, citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons.
[01:31:12.659 --> 01:31:18.762]  His decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another.
[01:31:18.842 --> 01:31:23.264]  In other news, President Trump also publicly blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not replacing
[01:31:23.564 --> 01:31:24.064]  We're good to go.
[01:31:45.742 --> 01:31:46.162]  We're good to go.
[01:32:03.570 --> 01:32:10.919]  Of the 30-plus proprietary products that we've developed for InfoWarsLife.com, DNA Force is the flagship.
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:19.891]  This highly advanced formula has been sold out for close to six months due to a worldwide shortage of the sought-after ingredients.
[01:32:20.211 --> 01:32:37.306]  Today I'm very excited to announce that we have received a limited shipment of DNA Force and despite the fact that we have been sold out for close to six months, I'm still discounting it 20% because I want listeners and viewers that haven't tried DNA Force yet to actually get a chance to see how amazing it is.

[01:32:57.959 --> 01:33:01.642]  And again, thank you for making the InfoWar possible.
[01:33:02.022 --> 01:33:03.403]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:33:04.838 --> 01:33:11.382]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:40.493]  All right, so here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office.
[01:33:40.593 --> 01:33:41.433]  It's that serious.
[01:33:41.574 --> 01:33:43.135]  This is not a diversionary tactic.
[01:33:43.175 --> 01:33:44.135]  This stuff is real here.
[01:33:44.176 --> 01:33:47.658]  This coup, this silent coup that is taking place is real.
[01:33:47.998 --> 01:33:59.527]  A soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:06.252]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[01:34:06.292 --> 01:34:11.977]  I got to go into the Congress and spend three hours from 9.30 in the evening to 12.30 a.m.
[01:34:12.497 --> 01:34:22.445]  with one of the senior ranking members of Congress and he told me, and of course this is what I said on CBN but they cut it out, but I'm gonna go public with this because we have to.
[01:34:23.046 --> 01:34:25.147]  He said there is a plot on Capitol Hill
[01:34:26.288 --> 01:34:36.298]  This is an effort to subvert the administration of President Donald Trump.
[01:34:36.798 --> 01:34:37.839]  It is nothing less.
[01:34:38.019 --> 01:34:44.225]  It is an effort by the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and a legitimate government.
[01:34:44.825 --> 01:34:50.968]  And now they're saying they want to unseat the elected president because he's a Russian agent and you've got the CIA in the middle of this with Obama.
[01:35:14.597 --> 01:35:16.638]  Saying we've got evidence they were involved.
[01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:25.520]  There's really no way to overstate the unprecedented peril that this country and this world is in right now.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:35.562]  Unprecedented with the CIA involved and electors getting ready to vote against Trump and all this other garbage I'm here to tell you.
[01:35:37.156 --> 01:35:44.440]  Under continuity of government systems, if there really was someone put in by the Russians, then the directives are to move to remove them.
[01:35:46.181 --> 01:35:58.587]  This is the cover they need inside government to pretend they're a bunch of patriots and try to organize enough people out of agencies to make a move against Trump to remove him or even assassinate him.
[01:35:59.867 --> 01:36:00.968]  And it can go a lot of different ways.
[01:36:02.049 --> 01:36:03.649]  They announce the electors aren't going for Trump.
[01:36:04.650 --> 01:36:06.671]  Next time he gets on board his plane, it blows up.
[01:36:07.688 --> 01:36:11.472]  And they'll just say it's a conspiracy theory, we don't know why it blew up, don't ask why it blew up.
[01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:14.395]  That's how brazen they are.
[01:36:14.715 --> 01:36:22.563]  Because they want a riot, they want a civil war, then they can bring in their control because they can't win a peaceful information war.
[01:36:23.324 --> 01:36:30.471]  You have a politicization of the agencies that is resulting in leaks from anonymous, unknown people.
[01:36:31.346 --> 01:36:33.588]  And the intention is to take down a president.
[01:36:34.068 --> 01:36:36.450]  Now this is very dangerous to America.
[01:36:37.051 --> 01:36:38.412]  It's a threat to our republic.
[01:36:38.932 --> 01:36:44.496]  It constitutes a clear and present danger to our way of life.
[01:36:44.696 --> 01:36:53.243]  And clearly, the other side, the deep state and the Clinton folks, and I have to say some folks on the Republican side, are all lining up.
[01:36:54.184 --> 01:36:55.605]  The battle lines are drawn.
[01:36:55.665 --> 01:36:59.368]  It's time for people to understand how to deal with this like it's a war.
[01:36:59.628 --> 01:37:08.354]  Government bureaucrats, particularly within the intelligence community, have launched a soft coup aimed at the Trump administration.
[01:37:08.555 --> 01:37:09.856]  You can read between the lines.
[01:37:09.916 --> 01:37:12.157]  I said, look, I said, that's not going to happen.
[01:37:12.598 --> 01:37:15.179]  He said, he said, well, really, there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[01:37:15.239 --> 01:37:19.423]  I said, we are going to stop it because we're going to mobilize the body of Christ.
[01:37:20.803 --> 01:37:25.827]  And the best description of it is by Barry Kesselman in his blog where he said this is a coup d'etat.
[01:37:26.527 --> 01:37:30.329]  He said 14 million citizens in private ballots picked Donald Trump.
[01:37:30.349 --> 01:37:33.151]  20 TV executives have decided to destroy him.
[01:37:33.251 --> 01:37:38.474]  This is no longer about Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.
[01:37:39.035 --> 01:37:49.401]  This is about a full-on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump.
[01:37:55.509 --> 01:38:08.935]  Now ladies and gentlemen, you notice that some of those clips are from 2016 of me saying they're going to use COG, they're going to try to block his electors, we've got to stop them.
[01:38:08.955 --> 01:38:13.797]  And then Pelosi's daughter came out and said Alex Jones is death-threatening me, I want him arrested.
[01:38:14.557 --> 01:38:15.478]  I never said anything about her.
[01:38:15.558 --> 01:38:17.339]  I said she's trying to have the electors turn.
[01:38:17.999 --> 01:38:20.120]  She was saying she wasn't, but then it came out she was.
[01:38:21.493 --> 01:38:23.114]  Everybody remembers them publicly doing it.
[01:38:23.614 --> 01:38:25.534]  They just don't like it because I know they're playing.
[01:38:26.455 --> 01:38:41.740]  And then we raise the alarm, and then everybody from Lou Dobbs to Newt Gingrich to Rush Limbaugh to Sean Hannity, then word for word uses my terms, clear and present danger, COG, coup d'etat, information warfare, and now Al Gore comes out, and now Brennan comes out, and they say, yeah, we're doing a coup.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.460]  We're going to overthrow him.
[01:38:44.941 --> 01:38:45.661]  We're using COG.
[01:38:50.171 --> 01:38:51.752]  Again, I've studied how this works.
[01:38:51.812 --> 01:38:52.672]  It's not rocket science.
[01:38:53.512 --> 01:38:54.733]  I know what the shadow government is.
[01:38:54.773 --> 01:38:57.074]  It was set up under nuclear war threat.
[01:38:57.414 --> 01:38:58.534]  And they're using that.
[01:38:58.914 --> 01:39:00.115]  It's meant to save the country.
[01:39:00.155 --> 01:39:01.135]  They're using it against it.
[01:39:02.096 --> 01:39:03.936]  Just like a COG was used against Hitler.
[01:39:04.517 --> 01:39:05.377]  Operation Valkyrie.
[01:39:05.637 --> 01:39:08.158]  Well, they're using the same thing now, saying basically Trump's Hitler.
[01:39:08.358 --> 01:39:08.758]  He's not.
[01:39:10.039 --> 01:39:11.139]  So it's not rocket science.
[01:39:11.179 --> 01:39:13.580]  That's what's so frustrating is I really did the studying.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:18.062]  Everybody else seems to pose and act like they know how politics and systems work.
[01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:28.335]  So I've been hammering this for eight months now, and we've already made it through a couple of the hurdles.
[01:39:28.475 --> 01:39:32.258]  Just like they said he wouldn't get seated, or he wouldn't get the nomination, or he wouldn't do this, or he wouldn't do that.
[01:39:32.338 --> 01:39:33.739]  Now though, they're frothing.
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:38.163]  I want to go to Leanne McAdoo, who again wants to get into the subject.
[01:39:38.183 --> 01:39:39.824]  It's great to have Leanne McAdoo with us.
[01:39:40.545 --> 01:39:43.447]  Leanne, what do we do, what does Trump do?
[01:39:43.488 --> 01:39:47.391]  Because this is so over the top, it's so surreal, it's happening.
[01:39:49.454 --> 01:39:56.496]  David made the point, Trump's gotta go public, he's gotta point out what they're, not just say fake news, he's gotta say, they're saying overthrow me, they're saying kill me.
[01:39:57.996 --> 01:40:01.077]  He's gotta, his Attorney General won't do anything, I know why he's upset.
[01:40:01.577 --> 01:40:08.538]  Everybody's intimidated, because they're going around threatening everybody, saying you'll be okay, Sessions, just sit on the sidelines of this.
[01:40:09.678 --> 01:40:12.579]  And where are the men in this country?
[01:40:12.839 --> 01:40:16.180]  I mean, they're openly organizing his overthrow.
[01:40:17.451 --> 01:40:20.897]  And people are going, well, we better let them take over.
[01:40:20.917 --> 01:40:20.957]  No!
[01:40:21.879 --> 01:40:22.860]  They're illegitimate.
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:23.722]  They're the criminals.
[01:40:23.802 --> 01:40:25.405]  I mean, this is such a no-brainer.
[01:40:25.705 --> 01:40:26.367]  Leanne McAdoo.
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:36.189]  Well, this is why I don't really agree with tweeting out this stuff about the trans ban, because he mentions that transgenders in the military are a distraction.
[01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:49.103]  Well, if they weren't a distraction before, it's definitely a huge distraction now, because now the left and the media and all of the celebrities are just talking about this trans ban and riling up their base even more.
[01:40:49.884 --> 01:40:56.391]  At the same time, we have all of these majorly important stories breaking that the media should be forced to cover.
[01:40:56.451 --> 01:40:58.333]  Well, now they have an excuse to not cover it.
[01:40:58.573 --> 01:41:00.095]  They have an excuse to not cover the coup.
[01:41:00.375 --> 01:41:11.327]  They have an excuse to not cover why the Democrats blocked a key witness who was going to testify against Fusion GPS and testify that this Fusion GPS was set up to
[01:41:12.928 --> 01:41:13.128]  I think?
[01:41:32.205 --> 01:41:43.195]  If this was Donald Trump and his aides who had allowed a foreign body, some foreign nationals, to compromise Congress, we would never be hearing the end of it.
[01:41:43.495 --> 01:41:53.804]  But we aren't hearing about it at all, and it's been going on for months, and the Washington Post doesn't even get into it and explain to you why this person's been fired.
[01:41:54.477 --> 01:41:59.600]  Making military wear red high heels and turning it into social justice order stuff's wrong.
[01:42:00.041 --> 01:42:04.824]  But I agree, the president is above that, and that should just be policy by the sec def.
[01:42:05.344 --> 01:42:13.510]  Obviously they want to have sex changes and all this in the military just to confuse things and social engineering, because they're bringing in the robots, they're getting rid of the humans in 2025.
[01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:16.212]  It's already been announced a decade ago and they're right on schedule.
[01:42:16.872 --> 01:42:19.714]  So that's what this is all about, just sabotaging the normal human order.
[01:42:20.074 --> 01:42:21.735]  We don't hate anybody for what they're like.
[01:42:22.115 --> 01:42:23.997]  We understand the chemicalization of the program.
[01:42:24.977 --> 01:42:26.098]  You know, just like Omega Man.
[01:42:26.298 --> 01:42:27.958]  We understand what's happened to folks.
[01:42:28.038 --> 01:42:30.359]  We understand they want to crucify us for trying to help them.
[01:42:30.719 --> 01:42:35.280]  But expanding on this, Leigh-Anne, what is it like for you, though?
[01:42:35.841 --> 01:42:38.562]  Because I'm not trying to toot our horn, but folks need to understand we are on target.
[01:42:39.102 --> 01:42:40.922]  We're talking about COG, overthrow of the president.
[01:42:41.262 --> 01:42:44.964]  They are now on TV everywhere getting their base ready for it.
[01:42:45.424 --> 01:42:48.765]  And phone calls I was getting three weeks ago are now
[01:42:49.878 --> 01:42:57.725]  Public, you know, the same talking points of we need bipartisan, he's going to be removed, it's going to be the military, just everybody accept it.
[01:42:58.045 --> 01:43:02.189]  They're actually trying to prepare everyone for a military coup in America.
[01:43:03.190 --> 01:43:05.152]  This is just completely insane.
[01:43:06.161 --> 01:43:12.225]  And your media and your celebrities are going to be front page news as they celebrate it.
[01:43:12.685 --> 01:43:15.827]  As they celebrate the downfall of the Trump presidency.
[01:43:15.887 --> 01:43:17.828]  It's something they won't even investigate.
[01:43:17.848 --> 01:43:21.350]  They won't even see were these charges appropriate.
[01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:22.711]  Is there a deep state coup?
[01:43:22.971 --> 01:43:28.895]  Will they even go on and educate these people on the deep state and why it is such a threat to our country?
[01:43:29.315 --> 01:43:30.857]  They're not going to have to do that.
[01:43:31.377 --> 01:43:45.110]  It's the deep state that began to eat the country in 1963, publicly coming out with Schumer saying Trump better watch it, the intelligence community has seven ways this Sunday to get back at you, and Brennan saying shut your mouth, now he says we'll just kill you.
[01:43:45.450 --> 01:43:47.772]  The arrogance, we didn't elect these people.
[01:43:48.233 --> 01:43:51.756]  I mean, again, this is everything the left always claimed they were against.
[01:43:52.036 --> 01:43:54.939]  Well no, now because it's their deep state, they want it.
[01:43:57.185 --> 01:43:57.405]  Right.
[01:43:57.545 --> 01:44:13.061]  And they also know that if they don't get Trump out fast or take him out in some way, a lot of the corruption that went on the last eight years has the potential to be exposed right now if we have the right people who aren't afraid to go up against these swamp monsters.
[01:44:13.181 --> 01:44:16.705]  If they know that they have the protection of the president,
[01:44:17.305 --> 01:44:24.229]  And the power of the presidency behind them, I think that they won't be as afraid to go after some of these really bad characters.
[01:44:24.849 --> 01:44:28.011]  But these are people who are potentially being blackmailed.
[01:44:28.351 --> 01:44:36.896]  They might be being paid off, for instance, by these Pakistani IT guys who, for whatever inexplicable reason, continue to be paid
[01:44:37.376 --> 01:44:49.700]  At three times the rate of the average House IT staffer, even though they never showed up for work, they never called into the meetings, many, many requests for computer repairs went unanswered.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:51.621]  This is how the Democrats penetrated everything.
[01:44:52.541 --> 01:45:01.330]  They allied themselves with foreign corporations, foreign governments, that's what the foundation is all about, the Clinton Foundation, to create her own separate state department, her own separate presidency.
[01:45:01.771 --> 01:45:15.204]  Even Atlantic Monthly, even Esquire, even New York Times admitted, you can search engine it, that Hillary was co-president under Obama and created her own competing agenda that even competed with some of Obama's agenda.
[01:45:15.785 --> 01:45:18.388]  So they only agreed on social stuff as a political diversion.
[01:45:18.468 --> 01:45:21.171]  As you said, that's literally, those are real issues.
[01:45:21.212 --> 01:45:23.254]  But for the elites, it's a total distraction.
[01:45:23.294 --> 01:45:26.238]  Like she says in the WikiLeaks, I can't stand my constituents.
[01:45:26.598 --> 01:45:27.079]  I don't want it.
[01:45:27.099 --> 01:45:28.300]  They always want more free stuff.
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:31.243]  They're a bunch of basement dwellers with their parents, baristas.
[01:45:31.764 --> 01:45:35.607]  You know, I mean, she's sounding like the big, you know, billionaire right-winger, because that's what she is.
[01:45:36.207 --> 01:45:44.212]  And it's just this giant bipartisan screwjob, and along comes Trump actually trying to stop it, and they're panicking, and they don't know what to do.
[01:45:44.573 --> 01:45:45.593]  And that's why it's so sad.
[01:45:45.633 --> 01:45:49.476]  The Republicans are fighting to keep Obamacare, because they wrote it to screw people.
[01:45:49.916 --> 01:45:56.921]  And then you see the average Democratic constituent fighting for it, when it's big insurance companies and big banks wanting to keep all that in place, Leanne.
[01:45:58.163 --> 01:46:16.574]  Right, well and as long as they can get their base mad about social justice issues, they won't ever be upset or call for a further investigation into the Obama administration's misdeeds and they totally broke protocol repeatedly in their investigation into Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:16.914 --> 01:46:18.474]  Why isn't anyone upset about that?
[01:46:18.574 --> 01:46:31.597]  Why are we having to beg for a Judiciary Committee to probe deeper into all of these issues surrounding the former Attorney General, or James Comey, agreeing to call it a matter rather than an investigation?
[01:46:31.617 --> 01:46:33.618]  And many, many other things.
[01:46:33.678 --> 01:46:35.038]  I mean, this is absurd.
[01:46:35.058 --> 01:46:39.099]  The illegal server, the $12 million from Morocco, all of it.
[01:46:39.439 --> 01:46:40.459]  Let me throw this out too.
[01:46:40.479 --> 01:46:42.560]  I see a talking point put out by the bots.
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:48.086]  And put out by the Democratic Party and Mother Jones and David Brock at Media Matters.
[01:46:48.526 --> 01:46:50.909]  That, oh look, Trump's got a bunch of swamp creatures.
[01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:54.674]  He fired all of the lobbyists that had been in the campaign.
[01:46:54.694 --> 01:46:56.255]  He followed all of his promises.
[01:46:56.636 --> 01:46:57.397]  Had Pence do it.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:05.122]  But of course he's going to get guides like Bannon, who was with Goldman Sachs for media acquisition.
[01:47:05.862 --> 01:47:07.223]  That's a very diverse big group.
[01:47:07.383 --> 01:47:08.643]  And like Scaramucci and others.
[01:47:09.163 --> 01:47:19.687]  What matters is that they execute getting us out of TPP, that they execute getting us out of the carbon tax, that they execute better deals to get jobs back here and know how to demolition globalism.
[01:47:20.027 --> 01:47:23.808]  What matters is the fruit of the tree, of course,
[01:47:24.628 --> 01:47:33.712]  If Goldman Sachs runs almost everything and Trump's trying to pull from experts that know how to do it, if I'm pulling it in my ship into a new harbor, I want the local pilot to take me in.
[01:47:34.013 --> 01:47:37.174]  What matters is what he delivers and how the elite are attacking him.
[01:47:37.354 --> 01:47:41.836]  So the elite are attacking him and trying to kill him, but also then telling us, oh, he's part of the elite.
[01:47:42.557 --> 01:47:44.197]  It's just absolutely insane.
[01:47:44.237 --> 01:47:46.298]  I want to tell the listeners something here that's really important.
[01:47:47.479 --> 01:47:49.600]  We have run the biggest specials
[01:47:51.124 --> 01:47:55.166]  I keep saying the biggest specials ever because I keep doing more and more specials because people love them.
[01:47:55.426 --> 01:47:55.926]  Bigger and bigger.
[01:47:55.946 --> 01:47:57.307]  We've had free shipping in the month of July.
[01:47:57.347 --> 01:47:58.007]  That's about to end.
[01:47:58.988 --> 01:48:06.512]  We sold out of a bunch of stuff so I took our main catalog and decided to discount it even more because some of the other stuff sold out and went back to full price.
[01:48:06.852 --> 01:48:07.552]  Super Female.
[01:48:07.572 --> 01:48:08.893]  We're going to do one more day on that.
[01:48:10.354 --> 01:48:10.514]  57% off.
[01:48:10.554 --> 01:48:11.254]  We've never done that.
[01:48:11.714 --> 01:48:14.036]  But women really never really buy this.
[01:48:14.056 --> 01:48:14.876]  Men buy Super Male.
[01:48:14.976 --> 01:48:16.097]  I guess we're mainly a male audience.
[01:48:16.137 --> 01:48:18.798]  But Super Female works great in women, great in men as well.
[01:48:19.058 --> 01:48:20.159]  Just a little bit different on the herbal.
[01:48:21.147 --> 01:48:21.547]  Thank you.
[01:48:21.607 --> 01:48:21.828]  Thank you.
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:39.541]  That's all available.
[01:48:39.981 --> 01:48:43.205]  We have the caveman combo of chocolate and strawberry together, 25% off as well.
[01:48:43.465 --> 01:48:52.696]  We have a super silver special, colloidal silver, silver bullet, the super blue toothpaste and the electric toothbrush with impregnated silver in it for 50% off.
[01:48:52.796 --> 01:48:53.577]  Amazing deal.
[01:48:53.837 --> 01:48:55.158]  We're selling the toothbrush at cost.
[01:48:56.159 --> 01:48:58.182]  Uh, continuing, we have the Pro-Pure Traveler.
[01:48:58.582 --> 01:49:01.986]  Amazing water filtration, high quality, one of the best units out there.
[01:49:02.286 --> 01:49:04.148]  There's three or four companies that have really good systems.
[01:49:04.168 --> 01:49:08.213]  They're apples and oranges, depending on which chemical they reduce to nothing or non-detectable.
[01:49:08.533 --> 01:49:11.696]  But bottom line, Alexa Pure and Pro-Pure are both great.
[01:49:11.736 --> 01:49:12.637]  Blow away the competition.
[01:49:12.998 --> 01:49:13.919]  We have Pro-Pure 30% off.
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:15.220]  I don't know.
[01:49:33.607 --> 01:49:38.130]  Knock out 50% off of Sleep Aid, Prostagard 33% off, MycoZx.
[01:49:38.311 --> 01:49:43.454]  It's a great seller, but I'm doing 46% off because people have had such dramatic results.
[01:49:44.235 --> 01:49:46.317]  I want people to get it right at a lost leader.
[01:49:47.409 --> 01:49:50.951]  Because it goes with our biome defense probiotic.
[01:49:51.172 --> 01:49:53.793]  But that only knocks out the bad bacteria and replaces it with the good ones.
[01:49:54.274 --> 01:49:57.996]  Prostagard MycoZx, again, is the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:49:58.537 --> 01:49:59.557]  Next level, folks.
[01:49:59.657 --> 01:50:00.418]  So amazing.
[01:50:00.758 --> 01:50:01.599]  Try it today.
[01:50:01.939 --> 01:50:03.800]  DNA forks 20% off.
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.641]  We are selling out of that right now.
[01:50:05.701 --> 01:50:07.843]  Unfortunately, it'll be months until we get more.
[01:50:07.863 --> 01:50:10.004]  It was almost six months since we last had it.
[01:50:10.405 --> 01:50:11.485]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:50:11.665 --> 01:50:12.106]  Alex, I'm sorry.
[01:50:12.606 --> 01:50:13.646]  I'm sorry, I've got to interrupt you.
[01:50:13.706 --> 01:50:17.768]  I can't believe the Super Female Vitality is not one of our greatest sellers.
[01:50:17.868 --> 01:50:19.628]  I take this stuff every single day.
[01:50:19.708 --> 01:50:20.108]  I love it.
[01:50:20.448 --> 01:50:24.490]  I probably shouldn't take it on air because I'm going to have to go... I didn't know you were going to do a plug, but since you're going to do it, let's skip this break.
[01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:25.470]  I'm going to skip this whole break today.
[01:50:25.490 --> 01:50:25.690]  Every day.
[01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:29.131]  I take this every... Start over, Leigh-Anne, because I forgot... Everyone knows.
[01:50:29.151 --> 01:50:35.553]  Start over, because, I mean, I want this testimonial because, I mean, don't get too graphic, but Leigh-Anne, tell us what Super Female did for you.
[01:50:36.670 --> 01:50:39.892]  Well, Alex, I mean, this stuff makes me hot.
[01:50:40.032 --> 01:50:48.597]  And that's why I'm glad I'm about to get off the show because I am going to have to go do a slow motion Baywatch beach jog after I take this super female vitality.
[01:50:48.617 --> 01:50:55.540]  It just, I want to go for a jog, but I want to do it with my hair blowing in the wind, like super fabulous, super feminine.
[01:50:56.061 --> 01:51:03.645]  I don't know what, I mean, the herbs are that is specifically in this stuff, how it reacts in the female body, but it is intense.
[01:51:04.085 --> 01:51:10.367]  And like I said, when I first was single years ago, when we first were getting this product, I had to stop taking it.
[01:51:10.467 --> 01:51:14.288]  It was a little, I wasn't ready to be feeling those feelings out there in the world.
[01:51:14.308 --> 01:51:23.810]  I was a little vulnerable for all of the, for the men that were going, wow, why is, did that girl bring her own slow motion fan with her when she's walking around?
[01:51:24.331 --> 01:51:27.631]  That's how you feel in the grocery store, just like a breath of fresh air.
[01:51:28.352 --> 01:51:32.773]  And I really love this stuff, but I really shouldn't take it on air because it gets me pretty pumped up.
[01:51:34.005 --> 01:51:35.386]  And folks, we're not joking.
[01:51:36.346 --> 01:51:40.608]  They make jokes that Gwyneth Paltrow sells some products that have similar ingredients to Super Female.
[01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:45.511]  And they go, why are they both selling the same thing on the comedy show?
[01:51:45.531 --> 01:51:48.092]  Because these are the known herbs.
[01:51:48.593 --> 01:51:50.914]  But the difference is, and I'm not bashing Paltrow's stuff,
[01:51:53.096 --> 01:51:54.436]  Ours isn't dried.
[01:51:54.736 --> 01:52:02.438]  Ours is freshly harvested and then it's cold pressed into an essential oil and then it's basically aged.
[01:52:02.878 --> 01:52:13.860]  And that's why we run out of it so much because it's produced by a group in Utah that's been making these for almost 70 years and then private labeled and developed for Dr. Group for us for sale.
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:18.000]  And so that's why it's so good as it's cold pressed.
[01:52:18.441 --> 01:52:20.601]  So it actually has all of the
[01:52:21.974 --> 01:52:25.555]  All of the different trace, whatever it is, that affects the body.
[01:52:25.575 --> 01:52:25.995]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:52:26.836 --> 01:52:33.478]  Well, it's just like when you do a juice fast, as long as you get the cold press juices, they stay super fresh for, you know, days, if not weeks.
[01:52:34.098 --> 01:52:39.140]  But I think it's really funny that Gwyneth Paltrow kind of just, she didn't beat around the bush.
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:41.300]  She just calls hers sex dust.
[01:52:43.041 --> 01:52:54.333]  If that gives you any indication of what our products... You keep it as a family show, so we've named it Super Female Vitality, Super Male Vitality, things like that, but she just cuts right to the chase.
[01:52:54.874 --> 01:53:01.121]  I thought that was hilarious, once again, with the Daily Show, was it, that was giving us a plug?
[01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:01.201]  Yes.
[01:53:01.281 --> 01:53:02.282]  I think it's just so funny.
[01:53:03.383 --> 01:53:04.483]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:12.066]  Shane Steiner about five years ago came in, and he's a big fitness guy, and he knew I was kind of out of shape then.
[01:53:12.086 --> 01:53:13.967]  And he goes, oh, supplement.
[01:53:14.067 --> 01:53:14.767]  Oh, Supermail.
[01:53:14.787 --> 01:53:15.347]  Yeah, right.
[01:53:15.728 --> 01:53:16.928]  You know, most of these supplements are bull.
[01:53:16.968 --> 01:53:18.008]  And I said, here, take some home.
[01:53:18.408 --> 01:53:20.309]  He was back a week later buying a case of it.
[01:53:20.329 --> 01:53:22.830]  He said, you say this is a workout stimulant.
[01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:24.931]  And for that, he said, no.
[01:53:25.411 --> 01:53:26.691]  My wife went crazy on this.
[01:53:27.312 --> 01:53:28.192]  This is incredible.
[01:53:28.212 --> 01:53:30.293]  Because particularly with women, even the Supermail.
[01:53:31.933 --> 01:53:33.013]  That's where you see the effect.
[01:53:33.053 --> 01:53:38.014]  But we just have it as basically for energy, for stamina, for feeling good.
[01:53:38.474 --> 01:53:39.795]  That's really what it does.
[01:53:40.715 --> 01:53:47.476]  So we don't sell it as an aphrodisiac, but quite frankly, that's what it's designed to do.
[01:53:47.776 --> 01:53:54.417]  And again, because it's cold pressed and concentrated over and over again in this patented process, that's why it's so strong.
[01:53:54.677 --> 01:53:58.338]  We sell a powdered version that's half the price, anthroplex.
[01:53:58.658 --> 01:54:00.260]  Right now it's so discounted, it's not half the price.
[01:54:01.161 --> 01:54:01.882]  Anthraplex is great.
[01:54:01.922 --> 01:54:02.642]  It's even stronger.
[01:54:02.803 --> 01:54:03.944]  It's organic.
[01:54:04.324 --> 01:54:05.706]  It's dried herbs.
[01:54:06.647 --> 01:54:09.570]  It's just not as active as what we believe.
[01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:11.772]  But some people like Anthraplex better.
[01:54:12.073 --> 01:54:13.474]  So, infowarestore.com.
[01:54:13.514 --> 01:54:15.637]  Thank you so much for the plug, Leanne.
[01:54:16.938 --> 01:54:18.380]  Any other products you've used that you like?
[01:54:19.073 --> 01:54:20.114]  Thanks for the super female.
[01:54:20.134 --> 01:54:21.936]  I actually have about two bottles.
[01:54:21.976 --> 01:54:23.017]  I'm going to need to get some more.
[01:54:23.077 --> 01:54:26.141]  So maybe now that they're 57% off, is that what you said?
[01:54:26.181 --> 01:54:28.043]  That's outrageous for that price.
[01:54:28.563 --> 01:54:29.685]  And I love the B12.
[01:54:29.785 --> 01:54:30.766]  I need the B12.
[01:54:30.846 --> 01:54:31.847]  Is it back in stock?
[01:54:33.088 --> 01:54:34.810]  Yes, it's been sold out for a few months.
[01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:36.732]  And seriously, the media makes fun of this.
[01:54:37.856 --> 01:54:40.339]  You die without vitamin C. You die without vitamin B12.
[01:54:40.359 --> 01:54:41.500]  You die without iodine.
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:44.182]  And the globalists all know this, and they're all obsessed with this stuff.
[01:54:44.523 --> 01:54:52.751]  And all we do is go out and look at all the mainline research about if kids don't get enough iodine, they have a 15-point IQ reduction according to the federal government.
[01:54:53.211 --> 01:54:55.072]  I mean, anybody can search engine that.
[01:54:55.092 --> 01:54:55.992]  This isn't our opinion.
[01:54:56.692 --> 01:55:01.714]  And they treat us like we're evil when Bezos is the biggest seller of supplements in the world.
[01:55:02.174 --> 01:55:07.816]  Jeff Bezos, through Amazon and through Whole Foods, basically has cornered the market.
[01:55:08.677 --> 01:55:12.198]  And you go on to what they sell, they sell the very best stuff to the very worst crap.
[01:55:12.998 --> 01:55:14.159]  We don't sell any of the crap.
[01:55:14.359 --> 01:55:18.220]  But again, we're evil for selling things that are documented.
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:20.681]  And super high quality.
[01:55:21.702 --> 01:55:22.205]  Absolutely.
[01:55:22.245 --> 01:55:24.399]  Leanne Shifting Gears and it helps fund the operation.
[01:55:26.178 --> 01:55:28.219]  Other stuff that's on your radar right now, Leigh-Anne.
[01:55:28.299 --> 01:55:30.219]  So much happening, so much going on.
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:32.400]  The so-called left panicking.
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:33.360]  To me, they're not even the left.
[01:55:33.961 --> 01:55:35.261]  They're just mentally ill people.
[01:55:35.281 --> 01:55:36.161]  I wouldn't call you right-wing.
[01:55:36.181 --> 01:55:37.102]  I wouldn't even call me right-wing.
[01:55:37.322 --> 01:55:38.462]  We're just pro-prosperity.
[01:55:38.962 --> 01:55:48.385]  They seem to be getting more and more frantic, more and more insane, saying, you know, the movie Dunkirk's racist because there's no black people, you know, in the Dunkirk evacuation from the Nazis.
[01:55:48.686 --> 01:55:49.566]  Well, that's because there weren't.
[01:55:49.586 --> 01:55:52.667]  You know, now they're saying that the average Roman was black.
[01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:55.199]  And BBC shows for kids.
[01:55:55.521 --> 01:55:56.406]  What is going on here?
[01:55:57.827 --> 01:56:03.711]  Well, they're just gearing up all this stuff to help justify this deep state coup against Trump.
[01:56:03.971 --> 01:56:17.100]  I mean, now that we've got this, who is it, the American Psychoanalytic Association, they're now saying, you know what, it's okay for our members to come out and just go ahead and say how they feel about President Trump's mental health.
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:24.205]  Whereas in the past, you could be sued for libel for coming out and saying someone isn't mentally fit to be the president.
[01:56:24.445 --> 01:56:30.130]  Well, they said it about Barry Goldwater, which wasn't true in the 1960s election, so they had to stop doing it.
[01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:33.153]  They actually have a law in their own group of regulation.
[01:56:33.373 --> 01:56:34.134]  They're not supposed to do it.
[01:56:35.353 --> 01:56:38.897]  Well, these people needed to be treated for their Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:56:39.317 --> 01:56:44.742]  Because I seriously doubt these 58,000 mental health practitioners who signed that online petition.
[01:56:44.762 --> 01:56:48.266]  I doubt that they're just non-biased.
[01:56:48.406 --> 01:56:52.310]  I guarantee they didn't give tons of money to Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:56:52.330 --> 01:56:59.317]  I bet you they're just these really good-hearted Americans who want the best for the country when they put out this online petition.
[01:56:59.657 --> 01:57:18.008]  I mean it's total crap and the fact that you can have all of these different groups now attacking the president and by virtue they're attacking the millions and millions of people who voted for the president by saying that we're all mentally unfit and that we're all racist and sexist and xenophobic and I'm sick and tired of it.
[01:57:18.028 --> 01:57:19.109]  That has got to be played out.
[01:57:19.129 --> 01:57:21.490]  What you just said is the key to everything, Leigh-Anne.
[01:57:21.590 --> 01:57:22.731]  Literally, this is everything.
[01:57:22.951 --> 01:57:23.552]  They're bullies.
[01:57:24.212 --> 01:57:32.577]  They're trying to dominate and terrorize people into submission, and they're trying to overthrow the will of the American people, and they're not going to stop with Trump.
[01:57:33.538 --> 01:57:34.858]  We are taking the country back.
[01:57:34.918 --> 01:57:38.521]  The globalists are throwing fits, and we have such a strong beachhead.
[01:57:38.561 --> 01:57:46.005]  We've got to stand with Trump, stand with making America great again, and expose these people and be public about it, and we will break the will of the globalists.
[01:57:46.025 --> 01:57:48.747]  But we are in a war of wills right now, Leanne.
[01:57:49.969 --> 01:57:50.549]  Absolutely.
[01:57:50.929 --> 01:57:54.691]  And that's why I really needed to come back to Florida to help my mom, help my grandma.
[01:57:55.071 --> 01:58:08.557]  But I just saw everything going on and I couldn't, I just can't sit back and watch as this goes on, especially not when I'm speaking with my longtime friends here in Florida who are just caught up in a lot of this rhetoric because they only kind of tune into the media here and there.
[01:58:08.937 --> 01:58:10.798]  So they're not really digesting anything.
[01:58:11.118 --> 01:58:15.320]  They're just looking at your headlines and the little blips
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:21.727]  But as long as CNN and these other outlets continue to repeat these lies again and again, it's as if it's the truth.
[01:58:22.247 --> 01:58:23.248]  And it is madness.
[01:58:23.288 --> 01:58:28.374]  That's why we are seeing so many mental breakdowns here online and elsewhere.
[01:58:29.485 --> 01:58:29.946]  That's right.
[01:58:30.887 --> 01:58:32.148]  Powerful information, Lee.
[01:58:32.168 --> 01:58:38.435]  And I want to come back into one more segment with you before David Knight takes over and we air the Spencer Pratt-Heidi-Montag interview coming up.
[01:58:38.455 --> 01:58:46.985]  I want to come back and talk about all these fake bots, the virtual reality that's Facebook, and how they admit they're targeting leftists to basically keep them vulnerable.
[01:58:47.005 --> 01:58:47.606]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:47.626 --> 01:58:49.207]  We'll show the Facebook article out of the Australia.
[01:58:53.368 --> 01:58:58.511]  Rediscover your fire with the EcoZoom Coal Rocket Camping Stove.
[01:58:59.091 --> 01:59:06.955]  It's easy to light and you can cook with wood, charcoal, or any biomass fuel in a rugged and durable design.
[01:59:07.155 --> 01:59:10.097]  And that means big power in a portable package.
[01:59:10.337 --> 01:59:16.260]  The Versa cooks fast, it produces less smoke, and it's fuel efficient.
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:20.582]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.
[01:59:21.002 --> 01:59:26.648]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.
[01:59:27.089 --> 01:59:32.414]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal, you got yourself an entire meal.
[01:59:33.736 --> 01:59:34.757]  Now that looks good.
[01:59:35.457 --> 01:59:42.225]  Go to infowarsstore.com for more details and see how you can become the master outdoor chef.
[01:59:42.845 --> 01:59:48.028]  And enjoy cooking freedom with the EcoZoom Versa Outdoor Stove.
[01:59:48.368 --> 01:59:52.970]  Available right now at, you guessed it, Infowarestore.com.
[01:59:55.671 --> 02:00:01.554]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.919 --> 02:00:21.125]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:21.586 --> 02:00:23.868]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:34.609]  And it's populist movements everywhere.
[02:00:34.649 --> 02:00:35.410]  It's not left-wing.
[02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:36.310]  It's not right-wing.
[02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:41.751]  It's populism and having countries that are based for the people and for their interests.
[02:00:42.071 --> 02:00:50.133]  And the best system is free market with a social safety net, but that is designed to be a launch pad for the baby birds, not a prison.
[02:00:51.253 --> 02:00:52.714]  You know, I think I had it in my bag.
[02:00:52.774 --> 02:00:53.334]  I lost it.
[02:00:53.794 --> 02:00:54.574]  I don't know where it is.
[02:00:54.594 --> 02:01:02.336]  I found one of these little buoys that goes on nets that's made out of pot metal and a hole got in it and it broke off the net and little
[02:01:04.702 --> 02:01:11.548]  Shells got in, little baby shells got in and grew until they were filling up the inside and couldn't get out the little hole and died.
[02:01:12.969 --> 02:01:14.371]  And that's kind of what the planet is.
[02:01:14.511 --> 02:01:20.576]  Are we just little spores that got in here and never get off of it and never develop and never see childhoods end?
[02:01:20.596 --> 02:01:26.762]  Do we just get trapped in this small little fake biosphere and let the globalist
[02:01:28.283 --> 02:01:31.004]  Use us as slaves and play God.
[02:01:31.544 --> 02:01:32.244]  I don't want that.
[02:01:32.345 --> 02:01:40.567]  Maybe we can pull it up, but it was in the Australian newspaper, The Australian, a few months ago.
[02:01:40.627 --> 02:01:44.549]  It was Facebook targeting lonely and insecure.
[02:01:46.527 --> 02:02:07.722]  But then when you actually read the documents that Facebook executives leaked, they thought they were so bad, they have algorithms and bots that poses their friends and try to keep you lonely and depressed and scared of nationalist populists so you stay in the little fake bot-ville where it's almost all fake bots being your friend, telling you you did a good job, telling you you're a good SJW.
[02:02:08.963 --> 02:02:14.427]  There it is, leaked document reveals Facebook conducted research to target and exploit lonely people.
[02:02:17.076 --> 02:02:17.716]  Think about that.
[02:02:17.776 --> 02:02:18.757]  And they want to keep you there.
[02:02:18.797 --> 02:02:19.937]  This is their whole plan.
[02:02:19.977 --> 02:02:20.778]  And Hillary says it.
[02:02:20.798 --> 02:02:22.879]  And I keep hammering this because this is critical.
[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:25.620]  This is critical.
[02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:31.003]  You have to understand, most of the bots attacking you on Facebook and Twitter, ten to one, are bots.
[02:02:31.083 --> 02:02:35.125]  Most of the Twitter attacks on Trump, they don't let the positive tweets get up at the top.
[02:02:35.970 --> 02:02:36.570]  They admit that.
[02:02:36.871 --> 02:02:38.311]  They talk about taking his Twitter away.
[02:02:38.331 --> 02:02:40.292]  Like, how dare the President have a Twitter?
[02:02:40.893 --> 02:02:46.916]  He should come back with, yeah, how dare Roosevelt have fireside chats for an hour twice a week on the radio.
[02:02:48.717 --> 02:02:50.398]  They fear him going direct to the people.
[02:02:50.458 --> 02:02:51.559]  He must go direct.
[02:02:52.459 --> 02:02:54.140]  You're going to see more of that now with Scaramucci.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:55.781]  But President Trump, here's from you.
[02:02:57.304 --> 02:02:59.266]  And he needs to speak out against the attempted coup.
[02:02:59.647 --> 02:03:03.911]  Leanne, what do you make of the Botville and how Facebook and stuff is already a false reality?
[02:03:04.132 --> 02:03:07.635]  We're on it because we're jacking into the Matrix to get to the bubbleheads.
[02:03:08.356 --> 02:03:11.600]  But, folks have to understand, it really is an artificial system.
[02:03:13.379 --> 02:03:18.826]  Well, and their fake reality has only just begun because we are just on the tip with virtual reality.
[02:03:18.886 --> 02:03:30.321]  We haven't even begun to let that be the mass market that Facebook and other tech companies are believing and buying into that it's going to be, where they can literally just strap us into headsets
[02:03:30.902 --> 02:03:47.078]  And we'll be plugged in all day to this virtual world while the real world, if it's not a matrix, is going on around us and they're able to do whatever they want and rather than have to, you know, now we don't have to turn on the news in order to get this information.
[02:03:47.098 --> 02:03:53.104]  It'll just be pumped at us non-stop and I can't believe that this is something that is really
[02:03:53.985 --> 02:03:58.087]  You know, that they're really going for and that people don't see it coming.
[02:03:58.167 --> 02:04:07.150]  That they don't already see how much our society has been changed just with cell phone usage and how we don't connect with our families anymore and our close friends.
[02:04:07.210 --> 02:04:14.513]  How everyone is so distant from each other and then we wonder why we get so depressed and so sad and we don't have those strong family units.
[02:04:15.153 --> 02:04:18.136]  Exactly.
[02:04:18.196 --> 02:04:27.464]  And they say, oh, other people don't have a family, so you can't have one now.
[02:04:27.504 --> 02:04:30.647]  They're actually teaching that, because we're being put into the matrix.
[02:04:30.987 --> 02:04:32.768]  We're being drawn into the corporate gulag.
[02:04:32.808 --> 02:04:35.811]  We're literally being put into a giant re-education camp.
[02:04:35.911 --> 02:04:39.935]  In their own words, Hillary says, we should make all the men go to fun camps.
[02:04:40.535 --> 02:04:45.016]  And they want national compulsory service, not in the military, but in liberal brainwashing systems.
[02:04:45.056 --> 02:04:46.437]  It's all being announced.
[02:04:46.517 --> 02:04:48.758]  Leanne, it's wonderful to have you with us.
[02:04:48.778 --> 02:04:49.558]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:49.598 --> 02:04:50.618]  Look forward to speaking to you soon.
[02:04:51.258 --> 02:04:51.719]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:51.959 --> 02:04:52.319]  Bye, guys.
[02:04:53.079 --> 02:04:53.459]  Thank you.
[02:04:54.019 --> 02:05:02.242]  Day but night, Will Honcho, the big interview, as the former reality TV host break out of the Matrix.
[02:05:02.282 --> 02:05:02.842]  Straight ahead.
[02:05:06.123 --> 02:05:08.664]  Well, it doesn't matter if it's the Financial Times of London,
[02:05:09.807 --> 02:05:19.915]  Whether it's the Washington Post, whether it's the Economist Magazine, or the Harvard Magazine, they all say globalism is collapsing, people are turning against it.
[02:05:20.215 --> 02:05:30.243]  We're not turning against internationalism, or being a citizen of the world if you want to live all over the world, or working with other countries, or accepting other cultures if you choose to adopt them.
[02:05:31.428 --> 02:05:38.553]  We're not going to be ruled by carbon taxes that bureaucrats and Rothschilds and Rockefellers and Soroses make money from.
[02:05:38.593 --> 02:05:40.754]  It doesn't mean Brexit's perfect.
[02:05:40.774 --> 02:05:42.295]  It doesn't mean Trumpism is perfect.
[02:05:42.595 --> 02:05:47.519]  It means it's about taking the power back to the people, back to the states, back to the government.
[02:05:47.619 --> 02:05:52.502]  And Stefan Molyneux is a businessman, author, researcher, very popular radio TV host.
[02:05:52.842 --> 02:05:54.523]  We appreciate him joining us for the next 30 minutes.
[02:05:54.883 --> 02:05:56.164]  Freedomainradio.com.
[02:05:56.444 --> 02:05:58.566]  Stefan Molyneux on Twitter.
[02:05:58.666 --> 02:05:59.867]  Freedomainradio on YouTube.
[02:06:00.467 --> 02:06:02.928]  Hundreds of millions of views, reaching tens of millions of people a week.
[02:06:03.068 --> 02:06:08.869]  Stefan Molyneux, looking at that, I mean, I don't know how to state the level of history we are at right now.
[02:06:08.949 --> 02:06:11.250]  I mean, I cannot overstate that to folks.
[02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:13.030]  We are at such an epic moment.
[02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:19.552]  It will never, ever in human history come down to as important a moment, Alex, and I really want to get this across to your listeners.
[02:06:20.172 --> 02:06:24.213]  If the state wins, if the globalists win, if the communists and the socialists win,
[02:06:24.813 --> 02:06:34.342]  Capitalism has delivered unto them such monitoring and control and video technology that it is entirely possible we will never ever be free again.
[02:06:34.762 --> 02:06:35.783]  It comes down to this.
[02:06:36.044 --> 02:06:40.488]  We have the technology to communicate free and peaceful and voluntary ideas across the world.
[02:06:40.868 --> 02:06:43.831]  They have the technology to control everything we do, to monitor
[02:06:43.931 --> 02:06:44.952]  For everything we do.
[02:06:45.012 --> 02:06:48.354]  They're talking about bringing in monitoring of the internet in the UK and so on.
[02:06:48.854 --> 02:06:51.416]  If we lose, we may never ever win again.
[02:06:51.456 --> 02:06:54.699]  There won't be some big cycle of history and your great-grandkids will be free.
[02:06:54.959 --> 02:06:55.859]  It comes down to now.
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:00.022]  They would use every tool in their arsenal to win and they're trying it.
[02:07:00.142 --> 02:07:03.745]  We must use every legal tool in our arsenal to fight back.
[02:07:03.845 --> 02:07:04.866]  Take no prisoners.
[02:07:04.946 --> 02:07:06.427]  Push forward every agenda.
[02:07:06.807 --> 02:07:08.268]  Challenge every relationship.
[02:07:08.348 --> 02:07:11.390]  Push forward because it's now, literally, or never.
[02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:12.411]  I strongly believe.
[02:07:12.731 --> 02:07:24.717]  They're going to have a breakaway civilization, put us into total squalor, use it to control us, and then use the fruits of the human mind and open society that has given us almost godlike powers to shackle us!
[02:07:25.337 --> 02:07:27.258]  I mean, this is... this is... un...
[02:07:28.318 --> 02:07:29.459]  Unspeakably evil!
[02:07:29.499 --> 02:07:30.079]  What do we do?
[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:31.200]  What do you do?
[02:07:31.460 --> 02:07:32.821]  You have to stop protesting.
[02:07:32.841 --> 02:07:34.162]  You have to start getting out there.
[02:07:34.202 --> 02:07:36.924]  You have to recognize that this is an emergency.
[02:07:36.964 --> 02:07:40.626]  There is no DEF CON level higher than what we are facing right now.
[02:07:40.666 --> 02:07:43.388]  You need to pull out all the stops, get all the information you can.
[02:07:43.728 --> 02:07:45.610]  You have a global communications network.
[02:07:45.650 --> 02:07:46.970]  You can tap into it anytime.
[02:07:47.011 --> 02:07:48.411]  You can challenge people in your life.
[02:07:48.852 --> 02:07:56.096]  It is down to this, because if we don't solve this peacefully, the kind of weapons that we have if it turns to war might end the entire planet.
[02:07:56.136 --> 02:07:56.557]  Wow.
[02:07:57.017 --> 02:07:58.078]  Stefan Molyneux, thank you.
[02:07:58.178 --> 02:08:01.199]  Always enlightening, but today was extremely powerful.
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:01.560]  Wow.
[02:08:10.685 --> 02:08:12.966]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[02:08:13.006 --> 02:08:18.850]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:19.250 --> 02:08:22.152]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[02:08:24.573 --> 02:08:25.854]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:34.558]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host on this Thursday, July 27th, 2017.
[02:08:34.638 --> 02:08:40.080]  We've got a report here, so you can find this on Infowars.com.
[02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:44.001]  Exclusive video, reality TV stars expose how reality TV is fake!
[02:08:44.982 --> 02:08:45.422]  Who'd have thought?
[02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:55.057]  Now this of course is Daily Mail has picked up on this talking about how Spencer Pratt and a pregnant Heidi Montage run into Alex Jones on Hawaiian vacation.
[02:08:55.457 --> 02:09:10.930]  We're gonna play that video for you here in excerpts and I gotta say it's not really something that I'm qualified to talk about so I'm gonna go this video here in just a moment because I haven't watched television folks since 1996 so 21 years and it's been a blessing not to be burdened
[02:09:11.090 --> 02:09:12.852]  With so-called reality TV.
[02:09:12.952 --> 02:09:13.953]  I'm absolutely amazed.
[02:09:14.173 --> 02:09:18.077]  The only time I ever see television is when we're traveling on vacation.
[02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:18.637]  Flip it on.
[02:09:19.058 --> 02:09:21.940]  First of all, I was amazed after not watching it for several years.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:22.801]  I just couldn't get it.
[02:09:23.302 --> 02:09:26.044]  When we moved into a rural area, we couldn't get television.
[02:09:26.765 --> 02:09:33.431]  We had other things to do, quite frankly, and I had other ways to get news, so I didn't need it for news, and I certainly didn't find it entertaining.
[02:09:33.451 --> 02:09:35.894]  I watch a lot of movies, but I don't watch television.
[02:09:36.474 --> 02:09:44.500]  And I was really amazed at how much they were advertising pharmaceuticals, but I was also amazed about this phenomenon of reality TV.
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:52.486]  I just could not believe how banal and uninteresting it was, but it seems to be something that's very popular.
[02:09:53.306 --> 02:09:59.928]  And of course, I think it's interesting too that one of the very first reality television shows was Big Brother in the UK.
[02:10:00.048 --> 02:10:12.632]  I think that that has been very effective in terms of creating an environment where people want to get on social media and share everything about themselves because it somehow makes them feel like they're a star, like they're a celebrity.
[02:10:13.226 --> 02:10:16.728]  No, you're simply under surveillance, like the people in Big Brother.
[02:10:17.008 --> 02:10:19.969]  So they put out this predictive programming to the audiences.
[02:10:20.370 --> 02:10:29.934]  They make it fashionable because then they were going to give you the CIA-funded Facebook and other issues so they could collect that metadata on you.
[02:10:30.394 --> 02:10:32.095]  That's really what they're looking at, folks.
[02:10:32.195 --> 02:10:34.917]  It's not even what you're saying so much or your phone calls.
[02:10:35.277 --> 02:10:36.998]  It's really the metadata that they can collect.
[02:10:37.498 --> 02:10:38.298]  So we're going to talk about that.
[02:10:38.338 --> 02:10:41.540]  But later on in the show, we're going to talk about some things I do know about.
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:52.569]  And of course part of this is this case that just came out with Debbie Wasserman Schultz showing the corruption and also the surveillance going on within the Democrats themselves.
[02:10:53.269 --> 02:11:09.862]  And of course these guys who are running this operation, getting paid fantastic sums of money, these ghost employees that work for Debbie Wasserman Schultz running the IT department, they had access to all of these dozens of Democrat Congress members
[02:11:10.783 --> 02:11:12.745]  Everything that they were sending out with email.
[02:11:12.805 --> 02:11:19.932]  And of course this was happening as the DNC, we later learned, was hacking the election against Bernie Sanders.
[02:11:20.152 --> 02:11:23.335]  Were they getting stuff on these people as well to blackmail them?
[02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:27.079]  Because we know that these employees actually blackmailed their stepmother!
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:29.621]  We have the actual indictment, yes!
[02:11:30.865 --> 02:11:40.871]  Well, the Democrats and their lawyers are saying that this is simply a case of misunderstanding with a mortgage that they took out and they're only being attacked because they're Muslims.
[02:11:40.951 --> 02:11:44.534]  No, they tried to blackmail their Muslim stepmother.
[02:11:45.675 --> 02:11:49.358]  And the person who's been following this at the Daily Caller has been laying this out.
[02:11:49.378 --> 02:11:54.422]  It's probably about two dozen articles since February the 4th, totally ignored by the mainstream media.
[02:11:54.442 --> 02:12:09.033]  And there's another very important story that's being ignored by the mainstream media until they trumpet the fact that one of the protesters at the Bundy standoff, I was there, I was covering it, one of the protesters there has now been sentenced to 68 years in prison.
[02:12:11.283 --> 02:12:21.554]  For exercising his constitutional right to peacefully assemble, to redress their grievances with government, to carry firearms that were legal in the state of Nevada.
[02:12:22.876 --> 02:12:27.581]  Merely carrying a firearm is not assault against a federal officer, folks.
[02:12:27.741 --> 02:12:28.502]  Sorry, it isn't.
[02:12:28.982 --> 02:12:30.403]  So we're going to tell their side of the story.
[02:12:30.443 --> 02:12:38.787]  We're going to tell how the judge is rigging this situation against the defendants because they're not getting their side of the case heard.
[02:12:38.807 --> 02:12:44.069]  Because you have a right under the Constitution to call witnesses in your defense to talk about what actually happened.
[02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:45.410]  But they're being gagged.
[02:12:45.450 --> 02:12:50.812]  There's a fence around what they're saying that's exactly like the fence that the BLM put up when we got there.
[02:12:51.152 --> 02:12:53.814]  They had a little tiny area out in the middle of the wilderness.
[02:12:54.634 --> 02:13:00.717]  With one of these plastic fences that they put up to control silt, and it said, First Amendment Area.
[02:13:01.017 --> 02:13:06.360]  And somebody had, and that was printed by the BLM, professionally printed, First Amendment Area.
[02:13:07.441 --> 02:13:13.284]  And somebody had put a handwritten sign there when we arrived, said the First Amendment is not an area.
[02:13:14.482 --> 02:13:15.684]  So we're going to talk about that as well.
[02:13:15.724 --> 02:13:17.006]  But let's go to this report here.
[02:13:17.066 --> 02:13:23.996]  This is Alex Jones talking to Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag about the reality television show The Hills.
[02:13:24.577 --> 02:13:28.442]  And they're talking about how there is no such thing really as reality TV.
[02:13:28.603 --> 02:13:29.023]  It's fake.
[02:13:29.664 --> 02:13:30.025]  There they are.
[02:13:36.189 --> 02:13:39.011]  We're here with Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt.
[02:13:39.451 --> 02:13:46.114]  It was about a decade ago that they first came on my broadcast because they were getting political and speaking out against globalism back when that wasn't popular.
[02:13:46.134 --> 02:13:47.075]  Of course, it is now.
[02:13:47.395 --> 02:13:48.796]  And there was a firestorm.
[02:13:48.956 --> 02:13:52.678]  Thousands of news articles, all the big tabloid shows, demonizing them.
[02:13:52.798 --> 02:13:54.739]  And right after that, their show got canceled.
[02:13:54.999 --> 02:13:55.860]  But they didn't back off.
[02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:59.021]  They're making America great again, I guess, proto-politics.
[02:13:59.361 --> 02:14:03.244]  And then I'm here in Hawaii on a vacation with my family, and I run into them.
[02:14:03.384 --> 02:14:03.924]  It's amazing.
[02:14:04.164 --> 02:14:05.506]  And Heidi's pregnant.
[02:14:05.566 --> 02:14:06.227]  It's very exciting.
[02:14:06.367 --> 02:14:08.569]  So it's very fortuitous to run into you guys.
[02:14:08.770 --> 02:14:09.170]  It is.
[02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:10.091]  Great to see you.
[02:14:10.312 --> 02:14:12.494]  I mean, obviously, destiny.
[02:14:12.534 --> 02:14:14.357]  And so it's great to see you.
[02:14:14.417 --> 02:14:18.221]  And a lot has changed in 10 years, not only with us, but the world.
[02:14:18.301 --> 02:14:19.943]  So it's great to see you in person.
[02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:43.137]  Yeah last time we saw you we were you know super hated and now we're pretty irrelevant and now you're the most relevant hated person that we know and I was like you took our game and I was a little sad I was like man now he's super famous and everyone cares about what he's doing and nobody cares about Spidey anymore so we need our we need our juice back here.
[02:14:43.477 --> 02:14:43.718]  Well
[02:14:44.398 --> 02:14:52.466]  I mean to get serious, you guys did get in trouble because the big crime for reality TV stars, and you guys were out there at the top, is to become political.
[02:14:52.886 --> 02:15:00.833]  It's come out there's secret societies in LA with thousands of movie stars in them who aren't even liberal or conservative, they're just patriots.
[02:15:01.234 --> 02:15:05.778]  Like Kurt Russell said, hey I just like George Washington, the Second Amendment, free market, I don't want to live in North Korea.
[02:15:06.118 --> 02:15:07.139]  You know, Second Amendment, you know.
[02:15:07.259 --> 02:15:07.499]  I think?
[02:15:27.268 --> 02:15:30.649]  Breakthrough politically, they gang up on and they destroy.
[02:15:30.689 --> 02:15:33.750]  But it's good to be hated by the establishment.
[02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:36.151]  The problem is if you're in reality TV, they can kick you off.
[02:15:36.191 --> 02:15:38.132]  So break down what happened as soon as you came on the show.
[02:15:38.452 --> 02:15:44.314]  So we were chanting death to the New World Order about 10 years ago after watching all your documentaries.
[02:15:44.774 --> 02:15:45.835]  And then about a week later...
[02:15:46.215 --> 02:16:02.624]  We are no longer on television and haven't had a consistent TV gig since then, so if the New World Order is watching, you know, we still will not accept chips, but, you know, we will take a gig in the established media because we have a baby.
[02:16:02.844 --> 02:16:07.087]  We have some bills to pay, so, you know, New World Order, we're available.
[02:16:07.107 --> 02:16:08.788]  I never thought I would say this.
[02:16:09.983 --> 02:16:10.984]  We'll take a check.
[02:16:12.325 --> 02:16:15.087]  But no, for real, be careful what you say.
[02:16:15.547 --> 02:16:25.074]  I'll tell you that much because... Yeah, it's a hard balance because you want to be able to say how you feel and what's going on in the world and to be able to have a voice or just be able to be a person within it.
[02:16:25.094 --> 02:16:31.479]  But like you said with reality TV, you're so disposable that we just were disposed of pretty quickly after that whole happened.
[02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:52.856]  Obviously I take some responsibility as well because I had surgery and certain things happened but it just got really crazy really fast and just such a height that it felt like out of our control in a lot of senses so we just like went into this really dark deep pit after that and had everything taken from us and kind of hit a low and then it's taken us
[02:16:54.958 --> 02:17:04.103]  But I will say, the black helicopters are real.
[02:17:04.403 --> 02:17:12.288]  We definitely had multiple black helicopters hovering above our hill set with 30 witnesses, like, what's going on?
[02:17:12.608 --> 02:17:16.150]  So people are like, oh, the crazy black helicopters is a real thing.
[02:17:16.630 --> 02:17:19.993]  Well, that's done as a psychological operation by some of the FEMA groups and things.
[02:17:20.273 --> 02:17:22.275]  So everybody talks about it, and then you sound crazy.
[02:17:22.315 --> 02:17:26.219]  It's kind of like famous writers that the establishment didn't like, like Ernest Hemingway.
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:29.802]  The FBI started breaking into his car, breaking into his house, messing with him.
[02:17:30.303 --> 02:17:37.489]  And then when he said it was happening, they said he was crazy, tried to throw him in a loony bin, and then he killed himself, or they killed him, the FBI.
[02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:40.072]  So there's a lot of ways that they psychologically mess with people, because
[02:17:40.732 --> 02:17:50.775]  With reality TV especially, they go out, they find interesting people, they make them stars, the public then loves you, gets addicted to watching, you know, the soap opera, the train wreck, whatever's happening.
[02:17:51.695 --> 02:18:03.599]  The producers from folks I've talked to that have been involved in shows, we talked to you about it, encourage them to have the train wrecks, to have all the drama, to have the problems, but then it tends to become real, get out of control, and then as soon as they're done with you, they flush you.
[02:18:03.819 --> 02:18:06.040]  So they just take you, use you to create an audience,
[02:18:06.641 --> 02:18:13.813]  And then they attach their messages onto that, and then as soon as you're not on message and being the puppet, they want the puppeteers drop you.
[02:18:14.437 --> 02:18:15.798]  That's 100% correct.
[02:18:15.858 --> 02:18:16.598]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:16.638 --> 02:18:19.320]  And it's hard enough to just be a Christian in Hollywood.
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:23.883]  I mean, that's, you know, and it's like people dissect that and say things about that.
[02:18:23.943 --> 02:18:25.764]  And I mean, that's my whole life.
[02:18:25.804 --> 02:18:28.005]  That's what I really care about and love.
[02:18:28.065 --> 02:18:29.446]  And that's hard enough.
[02:18:29.506 --> 02:18:32.608]  So to be able to speak just your mind in Hollywood, that's what they say.
[02:18:32.648 --> 02:18:33.549]  Stay away from politics.
[02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:34.549]  Stay away from religion.
[02:18:34.589 --> 02:18:35.730]  Stay away from all these things.
[02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:37.211]  It's just not something you want to get into.
[02:18:37.991 --> 02:18:40.333]  It's just a really hard balance being a person.
[02:18:40.353 --> 02:18:42.295]  Like you said, with actors, they're playing a role.
[02:18:42.315 --> 02:18:49.021]  They can be a different character, but when it's you and that's your role, that's the rest of your life that people are setting you up with.
[02:18:49.842 --> 02:18:51.603]  So it's very challenging.
[02:18:52.950 --> 02:19:00.973]  What's amazing is the production value that God gave us, speaking of God and Christianity, or believing in a higher power, and this amazing artwork that God's created.
[02:19:01.253 --> 02:19:04.215]  We come out here and right on time this huge double rainbow forms.
[02:19:04.515 --> 02:19:06.055]  It just disappeared, but it was here.
[02:19:06.075 --> 02:19:07.576]  Folks, we'll show you some shots of it.
[02:19:07.836 --> 02:19:09.457]  Actually, we should just move to the left here.
[02:19:09.477 --> 02:19:11.118]  We got a little rainbow still in the shot.
[02:19:11.378 --> 02:19:11.498]  Oh!
[02:19:12.038 --> 02:19:12.598]  Look right there!
[02:19:12.618 --> 02:19:13.959]  There's still some left right there.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:15.741]  Look at that, kids!
[02:19:15.961 --> 02:19:16.542]  See the rainbow?
[02:19:16.562 --> 02:19:17.924]  There was a huge double rainbow.
[02:19:17.944 --> 02:19:18.965]  I'll show you a video of it in a minute.
[02:19:19.025 --> 02:19:19.245]  Wow.
[02:19:19.646 --> 02:19:23.571]  So, let's... I've been meaning to ask you a question for months now.
[02:19:23.972 --> 02:19:24.933]  Do you watch Homeland?
[02:19:26.836 --> 02:19:28.278]  I have not watched Homeland.
[02:19:28.358 --> 02:19:29.580]  I've watched the boildowns.
[02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:31.422]  And at first it came out...
[02:19:32.023 --> 02:19:36.364]  And the guy was demonizing me, and I said, you know, that guy's making fun of me, putting words in my mouth that make me look bad.
[02:19:36.385 --> 02:19:37.665]  And people said, oh, you're a conspiracy terrorist.
[02:19:37.685 --> 02:19:42.587]  And then, of course, later they came out and said, no, we were trying to destroy Alex Jones, and this character is supposed to be him.
[02:19:42.607 --> 02:19:43.787]  So they have fake newsrooms.
[02:19:44.027 --> 02:19:45.007]  They put out fake news.
[02:19:45.267 --> 02:19:46.888]  I have hundreds and hundreds of employees.
[02:19:46.908 --> 02:19:48.489]  I was like, look at your budget.
[02:19:49.169 --> 02:19:52.630]  That was the one thing I was like, has Alex got this many employees over there?
[02:19:52.770 --> 02:19:53.630]  I wish we had that budget.
[02:19:53.650 --> 02:19:57.472]  But it turns out the Washington Post, CNN, and the New York Times actually do have giant
[02:19:58.812 --> 02:20:09.389]  Corporations they hire of contractors has come out in the news that do have rooms in some cases Every article every video, but especially these articles and videos we've been breaking down
[02:20:11.013 --> 02:20:17.598]  Dealing with the martial law, civil war, assassination, removal, sudden removal, coup of Trump.
[02:20:18.078 --> 02:20:19.940]  All of this is now confirmed.
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:23.182]  Talk about sensationally fantastic.
[02:20:24.563 --> 02:20:26.245]  Talk about living in incredible times.
[02:20:26.325 --> 02:20:29.567]  Talk about America and the world at the crossroads.
[02:20:29.607 --> 02:20:30.088]  This is it.
[02:20:31.088 --> 02:20:33.710]  And now, more than ever, we need your financial support.
[02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:35.751]  We have the very best products you need.
[02:20:36.152 --> 02:20:38.673]  Incredible air filtration systems that are $219.
[02:20:38.713 --> 02:20:39.074]  Similar units are $400, $600.
[02:20:39.134 --> 02:20:40.414]  Used to be like $800 a few years ago.
[02:20:40.455 --> 02:20:41.255]  The prices are going down.
[02:20:41.275 --> 02:20:41.795]  They're $149 right now.
[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:49.981]  $149, normally $219.
[02:20:50.081 --> 02:20:52.442]  That is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:20:52.562 --> 02:20:55.523]  The very same type systems, again, are $400 on average, upwards of $600.
[02:20:55.803 --> 02:20:58.904]  Pro Pure Travel are the very best gravity-fed systems out there.

[02:20:59.445 --> 02:21:02.066]  The other competitors aren't even as good, and they sell them for $200, $230.
[02:21:02.186 --> 02:21:02.786]  That's $132 right now.
[02:21:07.068 --> 02:21:11.129]  Super Silver Special, the electric toothbrush that has silver impregnated in it, amazing.
[02:21:11.289 --> 02:21:14.150]  And the Ployol Silver toothpaste, super blue.

[02:21:23.552 --> 02:21:24.193]  And why is that?
[02:21:24.273 --> 02:21:26.273]  Because we're basically sold out of the Super Male.
[02:21:26.393 --> 02:21:27.333]  I can't discount that.
[02:21:27.614 --> 02:21:30.394]  Super Female is very, very similar and works on men as well.
[02:21:30.434 --> 02:21:31.275]  But I want women.
[02:21:31.295 --> 02:21:32.875]  I've never really caught on with women for some reason.
[02:21:32.995 --> 02:21:33.395]  I think we should.
[02:21:33.475 --> 02:21:36.236]  It's even more dramatic than what I've seen in women, when it comes to libido at least.
[02:21:36.477 --> 02:21:38.497]  But stamina, energy, just read the reviews.
[02:21:38.698 --> 02:21:42.359]  Super female, 57% off, and so many other big specials.

[02:21:46.081 --> 02:21:49.662]  That's only a few more days, and the huge sales of July are over.
[02:21:49.923 --> 02:21:56.265]  Please support the broadcast, support yourself, and help fund the InfoWar in the face of this oppressive assault, because we're having victory.
[02:21:56.365 --> 02:21:58.346]  InfoWarStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:21:58.366 --> 02:21:59.087]  Thanks for your support.
[02:22:03.570 --> 02:22:08.434]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:22:09.535 --> 02:22:26.688]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:35.312]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[02:22:35.632 --> 02:22:44.875]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[02:22:45.675 --> 02:22:51.862]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[02:22:52.302 --> 02:23:06.057]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[02:23:06.798 --> 02:23:17.184]  Bottom line, when you purchase Caveman at InfoWarsTore.com, you're supporting the broadcast and true independent media that's fighting for the future of this country to be a free nation.
[02:23:17.544 --> 02:23:18.364]  So it's a win-win.
[02:23:18.644 --> 02:23:24.508]  But you really should try it for yourself to see what it's done for myself and so many others.
[02:23:25.288 --> 02:23:27.569]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[02:23:27.689 --> 02:23:28.950]  We're getting results.
[02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:36.253]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[02:23:36.613 --> 02:23:38.434]  Because of you praying for the broadcast.
[02:23:38.474 --> 02:23:42.336]  Because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[02:23:42.636 --> 02:23:47.438]  And because you spread the articles and the videos and the links and tell folks about our local affiliates.
[02:23:48.038 --> 02:23:49.839]  Caveman is back in stock.
[02:23:50.179 --> 02:23:51.500]  People absolutely love it.
[02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:57.602]  So please, secure your Caveman today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:24:14.221 --> 02:24:15.562]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:15.662 --> 02:24:19.345]  I'm David Knight, and we've just been watching the interview that Alex Jones had.
[02:24:19.366 --> 02:24:24.850]  He ran into a couple of reality stars, Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt of The Hills.
[02:24:25.771 --> 02:24:33.458]  They talked about how they had long been awake about the New World Order, global government, and when they started talking about it, they immediately got cancelled.
[02:24:33.478 --> 02:24:38.262]  But they also talk in this interview, they expose how reality TV is absolutely fake.
[02:24:38.282 --> 02:24:40.123]  So we're going to go back to that interview in just a moment.
[02:24:40.163 --> 02:24:41.745]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to remind you
[02:24:42.185 --> 02:24:44.406]  That we're getting very close to the end of July.
[02:24:44.466 --> 02:24:45.326]  July 27th.
[02:24:45.687 --> 02:24:48.288]  We began a very big sale.
[02:24:48.308 --> 02:24:50.289]  I think it's the biggest sale we've had since I've been here.
[02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:51.389]  I've been here for five years.
[02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:53.390]  Free shipping storewide.
[02:24:53.690 --> 02:24:56.391]  Massive discounts off of some of our most popular products.
[02:24:56.411 --> 02:24:58.172]  We've got discounts up to 66% off retail.
[02:25:00.493 --> 02:25:10.401]  And we're rotating through some of the sale products here, because some of them were selling out, and so we had to bring in some new products, like Silver Bullet, now 66% off retail.
[02:25:11.221 --> 02:25:14.604]  And this is going to be ending pretty soon, but again, free shipping store-wide.
[02:25:14.624 --> 02:25:16.425]  Let me give you an idea of some of the discounts here.
[02:25:16.445 --> 02:25:19.848]  We got our new product, True Whey Protein, now 25% off.
[02:25:19.888 --> 02:25:22.650]  That's part of the introductory pricing, as well as free shipping.
[02:25:22.810 --> 02:25:26.091]  We also have a Ultimate Protein Pack, 25% off.
[02:25:26.131 --> 02:25:29.672]  That includes Caveman along with the True Whey Protein.
[02:25:30.073 --> 02:25:33.194]  We also have a new flavor of Caveman that's 25% off.
[02:25:33.474 --> 02:25:35.955]  We have Prostagard, 33% off.
[02:25:36.235 --> 02:25:38.796]  We have DNA Force, 20% off.
[02:25:38.896 --> 02:25:45.658]  And although that's a small percentage, that is a big dollar savings because that is a very expensive supplement to produce.
[02:25:46.218 --> 02:25:49.179]  Very effective supplement, so that's a big dollar savings.
[02:25:49.479 --> 02:25:55.721]  But it's going to save you money on anything you want to try or buy at the InfoWars store with free shipping storewide.
[02:25:55.741 --> 02:25:57.542]  And that's not going to last very much longer.
[02:25:57.582 --> 02:25:59.363]  This is going through the end of July.
[02:25:59.383 --> 02:26:01.303]  We extended that independent sale.
[02:26:01.663 --> 02:26:02.944]  That's what keeps us independent.
[02:26:03.084 --> 02:26:05.765]  It's your support of InfoWars, the products that you buy.
[02:26:06.085 --> 02:26:08.046]  It keeps you independent of the food supply.
[02:26:08.066 --> 02:26:14.808]  We're just talking about how sperm count has dropped 60% over the last 40 years throughout Western countries.
[02:26:15.328 --> 02:26:26.761]  What is it that you can do to protect yourself, to protect your family against the kind of chemicals that you're exposed to, or the additives in your food supply, or even the substances that you find in your water?
[02:26:26.802 --> 02:26:29.445]  You'll find water filters available.
[02:26:29.685 --> 02:26:31.667]  They're 30% off the ProPure Traveler.
[02:26:31.727 --> 02:26:34.350]  That's a big discount off the ProPure Traveler.
[02:26:35.111 --> 02:26:37.032]  Take action proactively.
[02:26:37.393 --> 02:26:48.760]  You can get yourself somewhat independent of the pollution, the contaminants that you're going to find in our food supply, in the environment that they have set up for us here in the West to soft kill us.
[02:26:49.261 --> 02:26:52.243]  And you can also support the InfoWar at the same time.
[02:26:52.323 --> 02:26:53.463]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:26:53.683 --> 02:27:04.571]  Let's get back to that video, the exclusive video, reality TV stars talking to Alex Jones as he's on vacation in Hawaii and exposing the fakeness of reality TV.
[02:27:05.751 --> 02:27:13.092]  They've picked me as a figurehead of the Liberty Movement, and they think they can destroy me, and that will intimidate other people to not then speak out like what happened to you guys.
[02:27:13.112 --> 02:27:25.254]  But going back to 10 years ago, you guys went from being loved to being demonized when you said we're Christians, then they attacked you if memory serves, correct me if I'm wrong, then you said, hey, we're anti-globalist, we're anti-microchip.
[02:27:25.874 --> 02:27:28.235]  That took a lot of courage, and then they totally demonized you.
[02:27:28.515 --> 02:27:34.916]  What led you to start speaking out about your faith, speaking out about the liberal bias in Hollywood, and speaking out against globalism in general?
[02:27:36.383 --> 02:27:43.328]  I will say it was Heidi's music producer at the time, shout out Steve Morales, who was like, you gotta tell the world, Spidey!
[02:27:43.488 --> 02:27:44.168]  You gotta tell it!
[02:27:44.188 --> 02:27:50.152]  He had all your documentaries and just got us so pumped up and, you know, once I get pumped up, there's no going back, so.
[02:27:50.592 --> 02:27:56.897]  And your documentaries were just, there was nothing like it ten years ago, so they get you very, you know,
[02:27:58.418 --> 02:28:00.659]  Yeah, it felt like an awakening, kind of.
[02:28:00.679 --> 02:28:03.762]  It was like, oh my gosh, is this possible that this is going on in the world?
[02:28:03.802 --> 02:28:11.428]  And I think people now just know reality TV, and they know media, and everyone's just more hip to the industry, and editing, and things like that.
[02:28:11.468 --> 02:28:15.091]  But no one could even conceive anything like that 10 years ago.
[02:28:15.111 --> 02:28:21.596]  It was what it was, and now with fake news being such a thing, and it's just, it's a different world, and it changed very quickly.
[02:28:22.617 --> 02:28:27.800]  I'm curious where you think the world's headed in 10 years from now, because we see you 10 years later.
[02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:30.102]  So it's just, it's a lot.
[02:28:30.382 --> 02:28:33.504]  Also, speaking of fake news, how does fake news work in your brain?
[02:28:33.524 --> 02:28:42.529]  Because I feel like you've been, before it was called fake news, that's what InfoWars I feel like was, was just going after all these, you know, manipulations of media.
[02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:46.572]  So how does that play into your world now?
[02:28:46.912 --> 02:28:49.554]  Well, CNN came out a year ago and said, fake news.
[02:28:49.574 --> 02:28:51.075]  It was a John Podesta-Hillary term.
[02:28:51.355 --> 02:28:52.136]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:28:52.416 --> 02:28:56.339]  They said, call all opposition, any corruption we're involved in, call it fake news.
[02:28:56.359 --> 02:28:59.061]  Whatever we're doing, blame it on Trump, blame it on Alex Jones.
[02:28:59.461 --> 02:29:00.542]  And so it was an admitted plan.
[02:29:01.002 --> 02:29:01.823]  And so I actually have a...
[02:29:02.583 --> 02:29:06.465]  There's a host that works for me who had the site 15 years ago, nomorefakenews.com, John Rappaport.
[02:29:06.705 --> 02:29:08.086]  And that's what he's always called it, is fake news.
[02:29:08.526 --> 02:29:14.850]  Now that they've been branded back, now that we use that term back on them, they're now saying, please stop calling it fake news.
[02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:21.954]  Because now people are actually judging their stories and consciously thinking about the fact that, yeah, it's mainstream that's known to be the big liars.
[02:29:22.314 --> 02:29:24.375]  They're the ones that lied about dead babies in incubators.
[02:29:24.395 --> 02:29:26.336]  They're the guys that lied about WMDs in Iraq.
[02:29:26.716 --> 02:29:28.717]  They're the guys that lied and said Obamacare was free.
[02:29:28.737 --> 02:29:31.699]  You know, they're the people that have bodyguards that don't want us people to own guns.
[02:29:32.199 --> 02:29:34.100]  So really, they jumped the shark in a big way.
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:41.001]  And so I think it's destiny, as you said, that you guys said you were Christian, and then actually spoke out.
[02:29:41.561 --> 02:29:46.743]  The media then demonized you, tried to destroy you, but who knows where you would have been if you'd stayed in the media.
[02:29:46.763 --> 02:29:52.864]  You're listening to Alex Jones, and he's talking to a couple of reality stars from the Hill about the fakeness of reality TV.
[02:29:52.904 --> 02:29:53.645]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:53.705 --> 02:29:55.245]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.265 --> 02:29:58.866]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.416 --> 02:30:12.100]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:12.620]  That's right.
[02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:17.702]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.

[02:30:32.207 --> 02:30:32.407]  Woo!
[02:30:32.467 --> 02:30:33.367]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:30:33.487 --> 02:30:42.090]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:50.332]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:30:51.812 --> 02:30:55.134]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:30:55.254 --> 02:30:59.237]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[02:31:12.566 --> 02:31:20.731]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:20.971 --> 02:31:25.654]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:31:39.804 --> 02:31:46.669]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:46.829 --> 02:31:51.172]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:32:00.998 --> 02:32:02.679]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:32:03.439 --> 02:32:12.185]  After speaking with his military staff, President Trump has banned transgenders from the military, citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons.
[02:32:12.326 --> 02:32:18.410]  His decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another.
[02:32:18.490 --> 02:32:24.832]  In other news, President Trump also publicly blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not replacing acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
[02:32:24.892 --> 02:32:29.773]  It was at the center of controversy after his wife received $700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton.
[02:32:29.793 --> 02:32:32.314]  McCabe was handling the FBI investigation into Clinton.
[02:32:32.334 --> 02:32:37.116]  The President also blasted Sessions on Tuesday for taking, quote, a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes.
[02:32:37.256 --> 02:32:43.257]  So far, Sessions has focused more on ramping up civil asset forfeiture and prosecuting marijuana users than investigating Hillary Clinton.
[02:32:43.297 --> 02:32:45.318]  CNN, however, has launched an investigation.
[02:32:45.558 --> 02:32:45.978]  We're good to go.
[02:33:14.989 --> 02:33:20.042]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:33:20.544 --> 02:33:23.251]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:25.856 --> 02:33:27.256]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:27.336 --> 02:33:33.738]  I'm David Knight and we've been listening to the interview that Alex Jones had with Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt of The Hills.
[02:33:33.758 --> 02:33:36.939]  They're staying at the same Hawaiian resort that Alex is.
[02:33:37.559 --> 02:33:42.260]  And of course they began speaking out against globalism, talking about how they were Christians and boom!
[02:33:42.820 --> 02:33:44.560]  Their show was taken off the air.
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:49.682]  So they're talking to Alex about that and about the fakeness of reality TV.
[02:33:49.722 --> 02:33:50.362]  Here's that interview.
[02:33:50.402 --> 02:33:51.062]  We'll continue this.
[02:33:51.562 --> 02:33:57.191]  You try to destroy you, but who knows where you would have been if you'd stayed in the media the last four, five, six years.
[02:33:57.211 --> 02:33:58.213]  So you've got to rest now.
[02:33:58.513 --> 02:34:00.536]  And I've actually seen you guys have been back in the news.
[02:34:00.797 --> 02:34:02.760]  You're doing some new things, looking at some new shows.
[02:34:03.020 --> 02:34:06.525]  So who knows, you may emerge even stronger after you've been in the wilderness.
[02:34:07.344 --> 02:34:08.165]  Absolutely.
[02:34:08.405 --> 02:34:09.245]  That's how it feels.
[02:34:09.325 --> 02:34:16.370]  It feels like it was good to just have that time and to rest up and to reevaluate like our lives and our values and what is important.
[02:34:16.390 --> 02:34:21.673]  So I am thankful for everything that's happened and I think that God definitely uses everything for good.
[02:34:21.753 --> 02:34:27.717]  So I'm ready to re-emerge better than before and stronger in a way more prepared way.
[02:34:27.897 --> 02:34:28.858]  I came from Colorado.
[02:34:29.538 --> 02:34:32.201]  Small-town girl with you know, I didn't grow up with money or anything.
[02:34:32.221 --> 02:34:46.655]  I was very different than everyone else on that show So now I feel like I have a better head on my shoulders and a grasp and we could do it way better I will say when I saw you walking by the pool as the first time I was like, oh my gosh My life is a computer simulation.
[02:34:47.036 --> 02:34:47.837]  I'm in the matrix.
[02:34:47.857 --> 02:34:47.877]  I
[02:34:48.317 --> 02:34:49.558]  Like, it was like a real moment.
[02:34:49.578 --> 02:34:51.560]  I was like, whoa, this isn't real.
[02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:55.364]  Because it was seeing you, you know, now everyone knows you.
[02:34:55.384 --> 02:35:00.709]  We knew you and you were just like, if you knew Alex Jones, you were in like a secret clique, you know?
[02:35:00.769 --> 02:35:05.314]  So, yeah, like, yeah, like when I started buying crystals, it was still out there.
[02:35:05.354 --> 02:35:07.576]  Now it's trendy and everyone buys crystals.
[02:35:09.037 --> 02:35:32.136]  But to me it's hard because people you know I've been so hated and probably still am but seeing you now be probably ahead of me on the hate list trips me out because of editing because I know most of my hate is from editing so I wonder from your perspective how much of the hate that you feel you know is just from a bad edit versus things you're like okay you know there are things I've said that I you know I wish I hadn't said.
[02:35:32.796 --> 02:35:37.437]  Yeah, but there are things that are completely, my words, put in different situations.
[02:35:37.477 --> 02:35:44.799]  So like, I know from watching you for years that you're not like, I know people are going to eat me alive for this, but a bad guy.
[02:35:45.119 --> 02:35:50.880]  But then people see this whole Sandy Hook spin that they have and they're like, he doesn't believe parents in the bait, you know?
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:55.141]  And then even when I come out two, three years ago and say, I believe the kids did die, they'll never play the clips.
[02:35:55.601 --> 02:35:56.621]  They play edited clips.
[02:35:56.641 --> 02:36:00.042]  That's what Megyn Kelly did on Fox, where I said, you know, Hillary has personally
[02:36:00.742 --> 02:36:00.962]  I don't
[02:36:24.844 --> 02:36:33.248]  Probably five hours of interviews with her, a total of 12 hours their cameras were there from 9.30 in the morning till about 10 o'clock at night when the interview ended, about 9.50.
[02:36:33.828 --> 02:36:41.152]  So 12 hours I let their cameras in, and I'm in that 20-minute piece, maybe two minutes, and it's edited.
[02:36:41.913 --> 02:36:48.556]  In fact, we can't even release the piece because we have all these hours recorded of audio because it takes so much time to find where on there with all the notes because, I mean,
[02:36:49.767 --> 02:36:52.291]  An hour and a half here, they'll edit it together with something over here.
[02:36:52.611 --> 02:36:55.616]  And you've got to listen and find where it's totally two different subjects.
[02:36:55.936 --> 02:36:58.520]  And they've edited it together to make you sound like a monster.
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:02.406]  Because she's like, why did you say that about the kids and you don't believe they died and you stalked the parents?
[02:37:02.446 --> 02:37:02.947]  Which I never did.
[02:37:03.267 --> 02:37:03.668]  And I say...
[02:37:04.841 --> 02:37:07.722]  Well, you know, I said all that before it was in the news media.
[02:37:08.422 --> 02:37:10.943]  And it sounds like I did it because I thought nobody was paying attention.
[02:37:11.083 --> 02:37:15.545]  I said, I came out and said kids probably did die before it was ever a controversy.
[02:37:16.125 --> 02:37:19.026]  But then they acted like, oh, he went back and thought I was weak on the subject.
[02:37:19.306 --> 02:37:20.826]  So they thought I'd apologize about it.
[02:37:20.866 --> 02:37:22.167]  And so that's how they use the fact that...
[02:37:22.967 --> 02:37:27.771]  My listeners were the ones that didn't believe it, because they clearly used some green screens to, you know, maximize it.
[02:37:27.791 --> 02:37:28.972]  They had PR firms there.
[02:37:29.232 --> 02:37:31.935]  They've been caught, you know, CNN caught faking locations.
[02:37:32.035 --> 02:37:34.797]  I just said it should be investigated, along with a bunch of other people.
[02:37:35.077 --> 02:37:37.960]  Then they chose me, and it's almost like I killed the kids now.
[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:42.984]  That's exactly, because the negativity in my at-mentions and everything is when I said we're going on.
[02:37:43.044 --> 02:37:43.505]  People are like,
[02:37:43.965 --> 02:37:45.346]  He does, there's a baby's this.
[02:37:45.426 --> 02:37:47.327]  I'm like, he's not like that.
[02:37:47.447 --> 02:37:48.207]  That's the branding.
[02:37:48.227 --> 02:37:51.288]  They pick us because you guys were the Christian conservatives on the show.
[02:37:51.649 --> 02:37:55.670]  So it ended up making you the most popular because they chose you to be the villains.
[02:37:56.191 --> 02:37:57.351]  So see, that's actually the good thing.
[02:37:57.391 --> 02:37:57.871]  This system.
[02:37:57.931 --> 02:37:58.091]  So.
[02:37:59.492 --> 02:38:25.705]  Corrupt and falling apart now that this is the time to have it hate you it still hurts still has some effect But now you've got a voice to actually challenge it whereas you know ten years ago five years ago still Alternative media Facebook mentions that didn't exist or Instagram or snapchat like now I feel like I finally all these people that are I'm communicating with it's to them I don't have edit I don't have like what they did to you and shot you up with bright lights making you look all sweaty and every less another thing is
[02:38:26.545 --> 02:38:29.206]  People when you came on said, oh, those people are publicity whores, blah, blah, blah.
[02:38:29.226 --> 02:38:31.067]  And I said, listen, they're going to get heat doing this.
[02:38:31.467 --> 02:38:32.648]  And I've talked to them, you know, off air.
[02:38:32.688 --> 02:38:34.309]  They, you know, they're really into fighting the new world order.
[02:38:34.509 --> 02:38:35.549]  They've really seen the films.
[02:38:36.029 --> 02:38:37.490]  And so I said, say what you want about them.
[02:38:37.570 --> 02:38:39.711]  They're actually taking a risk doing this.
[02:38:39.731 --> 02:38:40.852]  And that's the same thing with Trump.
[02:38:40.872 --> 02:38:41.832]  People want to demonize Trump all the time.
[02:38:44.264 --> 02:38:46.426]  I mean, in reality, he is just being the president.
[02:38:46.666 --> 02:38:49.810]  He's actually returning power back to the country, and that's why he's being demonized.
[02:38:50.090 --> 02:38:51.271]  It's their fault for running Hillary.
[02:38:51.972 --> 02:38:53.914]  Where do you fit in?
[02:38:53.934 --> 02:38:57.437]  Because I know I'm sure you say it on the side, on the radio, but what's the deal with the Russians?
[02:38:57.538 --> 02:38:58.098]  Fill me in.
[02:38:58.118 --> 02:38:58.779]  Is this all...
[02:39:00.643 --> 02:39:03.565]  What's your honest, 100% take on this whole Russian thing?
[02:39:03.906 --> 02:39:04.586]  If you go to D.C.
[02:39:04.646 --> 02:39:13.793]  or New York, there are Russians and Chinese and people from India, people from Israel, people from the U.K., people from France, the E.U., people from the Vatican, and people from Saudi Arabia.
[02:39:14.054 --> 02:39:18.777]  There are PR people and lobbyists crawling out of the walls.
[02:39:18.817 --> 02:39:21.339]  And so Russians are constantly throwing sex ops at you.
[02:39:21.359 --> 02:39:22.560]  You know, hot blondes.
[02:39:23.241 --> 02:39:24.002]  Honey traps.
[02:39:24.062 --> 02:39:24.622]  Yeah, honey traps.
[02:39:24.642 --> 02:39:25.423]  They're constantly.
[02:39:25.623 --> 02:39:26.624]  But they're like the subgroup.
[02:39:28.425 --> 02:39:34.407]  The Russians about six, seven years ago cut back on that and mainly, you know, just use information, you know, TV stuff.
[02:39:34.427 --> 02:39:37.048]  But they're secondary players reorganizing their country.
[02:39:37.288 --> 02:39:40.609]  The Communist Chinese have infiltrated every major company, defense company.
[02:39:40.629 --> 02:39:41.750]  They're transferring everything back.
[02:39:41.770 --> 02:39:42.890]  They're in all our computer systems.
[02:39:43.210 --> 02:39:45.011]  Most of our chips get made there with backdoors.
[02:39:45.331 --> 02:39:46.291]  We put backdoors in them.
[02:39:46.331 --> 02:39:49.592]  It's a total cyber infiltration, AI system war.
[02:39:49.792 --> 02:39:51.053]  So we're in an AI war with China.
[02:39:51.253 --> 02:39:51.693]  China's got
[02:39:52.213 --> 02:39:56.156]  Massive acceleration war with genetic engineering, probably even way ahead of what we've got.
[02:39:56.176 --> 02:39:57.076]  It's totally insane.
[02:39:57.537 --> 02:40:00.879]  Chimeras, human-animal hybrids, you know, just something they had 20 years ago.
[02:40:01.279 --> 02:40:03.721]  Cows that create human milk and they sell them on the market in China.
[02:40:04.021 --> 02:40:05.662]  And I mean, here it's not even in the news.
[02:40:05.702 --> 02:40:06.683]  I mean, it's just so advanced.
[02:40:07.003 --> 02:40:10.105]  So Russia has fast missiles and a lot of nukes.
[02:40:10.165 --> 02:40:12.647]  I mean, they are basically an old world country.
[02:40:13.207 --> 02:40:14.869]  That's basically third world in many areas.
[02:40:15.709 --> 02:40:16.610]  And they're trying to reorganize.
[02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:17.370]  They're seen as weak.
[02:40:17.791 --> 02:40:19.312]  So the globals are trying to overthrow it.
[02:40:20.052 --> 02:40:26.757]  They want to put kind of a Hollywood social engineering thing to break the Russian will to get rid of their Christian roots because it's not compatible with globalism.
[02:40:26.777 --> 02:40:32.742]  So Russia's crime is it got away from the very globalists that run our country, the very Bolshevik corporate system.
[02:40:33.342 --> 02:40:37.165]  Trump and their people are being illegally surveilled massively by Obama.
[02:40:37.205 --> 02:40:40.167]  And so there's some basic Russian contacts by Senator Sessions.
[02:40:40.187 --> 02:40:41.388]  That was his job.
[02:40:41.768 --> 02:40:42.729]  So they have the intercepts.
[02:40:42.749 --> 02:40:44.791]  They can say, yeah, you met a couple Russians here and there.
[02:40:45.191 --> 02:40:47.313]  When that's totally normal and it's what senators do.
[02:40:47.633 --> 02:40:49.055]  And of course, Donald Jr.
[02:40:49.395 --> 02:40:50.416]  meant to get dirt on Hillary.
[02:40:50.456 --> 02:40:51.577]  They were getting dirt on Trump.
[02:40:51.938 --> 02:40:53.359]  So that's what you do in opposition research.
[02:40:53.679 --> 02:40:58.404]  So they take normal behavior and blow it up like it's this huge, you know, horrible thing.
[02:40:58.784 --> 02:40:59.685]  A mountain out of a molehill.
[02:41:01.026 --> 02:41:15.216]  10% of teapot, but then with Hillary they did it because 100 million out of Russian banks to her foundation 30-something million to get to uranium I mean she was meeting with Putin secretly and talked about being in his inner sanctum And you know these power man folks are all obsessed with Putin's he actually runs things.
[02:41:15.556 --> 02:41:26.303]  He's actually in charge They're all kind of minions of like Henry Kissinger and Brzezinski and Rockefeller who are all dying So they're all looking for who their daddy is right now And they all secretly are obsessed with Putin because he took Russia away from them
[02:41:26.323 --> 02:41:26.863]  I think so.
[02:41:54.219 --> 02:42:01.584]  The secrets of reality TV, because you guys are undoubtedly right up there with the Kardashians, you know, right up there with the biggest reality shows, Jesse James, you name it.
[02:42:01.884 --> 02:42:04.306]  I mean, I'd say Jesse James is probably number one, the Kardashians number two.
[02:42:04.386 --> 02:42:04.886]  I mean, who knows?
[02:42:05.166 --> 02:42:07.428]  I mean, he kind of founded the modern genre.
[02:42:07.708 --> 02:42:12.291]  But overall, so much of reality TV for folks I've talked to isn't real reality TV.
[02:42:12.311 --> 02:42:13.412]  With Jesse James, it was real.
[02:42:14.312 --> 02:42:16.854]  He wouldn't do it anymore because it just got boring and they wanted to make it fake.
[02:42:17.314 --> 02:42:21.517]  He wanted to just teach people how to make things, you know, not actually sit there and, you know, act cool or whatever.
[02:42:22.097 --> 02:42:24.338]  And, I mean, what would you guys like to do as a show?
[02:42:25.199 --> 02:42:28.561]  B, but A, what are some of the secrets of reality TV?
[02:42:28.741 --> 02:42:30.322]  I mean, did they try to make you act bad?
[02:42:30.602 --> 02:42:32.563]  Did they try to make you guys make fools of yourselves?
[02:42:33.244 --> 02:42:36.266]  It's pretty much if you didn't do what the producers...
[02:42:37.605 --> 02:42:41.968]  But pretty much if you didn't do what the producers wanted you to do, you weren't getting paid.
[02:42:42.388 --> 02:42:44.730]  And they just say, oh, you're not going to be on this episode.
[02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:47.592]  So then you say, oh, I would like that huge paycheck.
[02:42:47.632 --> 02:42:48.573]  What would you like me to say?
[02:42:49.980 --> 02:43:18.963]  Yeah and I think that once you came on and with Lauren it was like technically her show and so once I wasn't playing by those rules and the rule that they cast me by they decided to just change my entire character because I feel like season one I had a lot of people who were like supportive and happy and still everyone still texts me I love you season one it's like but not much changed I mean after season one except editing I was still the same person I was just dating someone that the narrator didn't love so it definitely
[02:43:19.483 --> 02:43:23.886]  Changed into this really challenging situation when it was something that was supposed to be fun.
[02:43:23.906 --> 02:43:28.089]  So we saw kind of the dark side of the moon of reality TV.
[02:43:29.289 --> 02:43:40.857]  I would say the wildest experience with reality TV is you could be talking to one person about something and then once it edits, that same line is put in a new sentence and you're talking to a different person.
[02:43:40.897 --> 02:43:46.260]  So, you know, when Alex talks about being edited wrong and people are like, oh, of course, he's lying.
[02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:47.341]  It's like, I'm like, oh, no.
[02:43:48.410 --> 02:43:50.251]  These editors are magicians, so.
[02:43:51.051 --> 02:43:54.392]  Editing is the original fake news, so.
[02:43:54.953 --> 02:43:56.133]  As far as I'm concerned.
[02:43:56.233 --> 02:44:01.555]  So besides this exciting baby coming October 19th, we want to stay alive.
[02:44:02.295 --> 02:44:05.276]  We want to get back to being famous and rich.
[02:44:05.837 --> 02:44:08.298]  That means joining a secret society.
[02:44:08.358 --> 02:44:09.558]  No, that's not true.
[02:44:09.598 --> 02:44:10.779]  Just kidding, Mr. Jones.
[02:44:11.979 --> 02:44:13.620]  But not join a secret society.
[02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:14.260]  It's not worth it.
[02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:18.282]  Well, there's also a lot of fake secret societies that want to use you.
[02:44:18.322 --> 02:44:20.223]  But seriously, you guys have been in the top.
[02:44:20.283 --> 02:44:21.364]  I wouldn't say you went to the bottom.
[02:44:21.384 --> 02:44:27.467]  You guys are saying just because you got locked out of stuff because you weren't playing ball and were speaking up for what you believed in, that's why they demonized you.
[02:44:27.507 --> 02:44:34.050]  And people now understand who's getting demonized generally is who either is at least good or wasn't following orders and is a rebel and a maverick.
[02:44:34.270 --> 02:44:35.291]  That's the place you want to be.
[02:44:36.252 --> 02:44:37.614]  So, I mean, I get the joke.
[02:44:38.155 --> 02:44:41.359]  Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag are about to infiltrate Hollywood again.
[02:44:41.379 --> 02:44:42.761]  But the thing is, Hollywood is collapsing.
[02:44:43.042 --> 02:44:44.023]  That whole system is falling.
[02:44:44.043 --> 02:44:46.286]  What type of projects have you guys thought about doing?
[02:44:47.168 --> 02:44:49.349]  I think just something that makes sense for our lives.
[02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:55.572]  So at this point in our lives, I'm not going to do something that compromises our integrity and our families.
[02:44:55.692 --> 02:45:08.319]  And so if it's something that's fun and light-hearted and a feel-good show that can actually help other families, like I love the show The Chrisleys Know Best because it's a fun, light-hearted family show and I think that can really help bring families together.
[02:45:08.439 --> 02:45:14.882]  So if it was something like that, I'd love to do it and I think it'd be great for us and a good opportunity, but I'm definitely not going to
[02:45:15.762 --> 02:45:19.826]  Um, play the villain or compromise our morals anymore.
[02:45:20.147 --> 02:45:24.311]  How many of the reality shows from folks you've talked to and what you've experienced are like, you know, 100% real?
[02:45:24.371 --> 02:45:28.555]  And what would those shows be versus half real versus, you know, totally staged?
[02:45:29.475 --> 02:45:31.998]  I would say the only reality show that's 100% real is Cops.
[02:45:35.117 --> 02:45:38.040]  Yeah, it's a hard, you know, everything is for media.
[02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:38.940]  It's on media.
[02:45:39.161 --> 02:45:40.161]  It's for entertainment.
[02:45:40.462 --> 02:45:44.225]  So, at the end of the day, there's always going to be editing and producing.
[02:45:44.245 --> 02:45:45.186]  Well, I can tell you this.
[02:45:45.566 --> 02:45:49.970]  When I throw a fit every once in a while and you stomp off the stage or those stuff, it's real.
[02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:52.332]  In fact, let's just... Hold on, let's get that again.
[02:45:52.352 --> 02:45:53.472]  Let's get that again.
[02:45:53.492 --> 02:45:54.393]  Let's get that again.
[02:45:54.413 --> 02:45:55.394]  Here, let's ask the crew.
[02:45:55.454 --> 02:45:56.315]  Is it real when I get mad?
[02:45:56.615 --> 02:45:57.636]  It's absolutely 100% real.
[02:45:57.996 --> 02:45:58.597]  It's not fake, huh?
[02:45:58.617 --> 02:45:58.957]  It's not fake.
[02:45:58.997 --> 02:46:00.318]  There's no fake here.
[02:46:00.338 --> 02:46:01.199]  What do you call those?
[02:46:01.219 --> 02:46:02.200]  Is somebody calling the shots here?
[02:46:03.004 --> 02:46:03.805]  No one's calling the shots.
[02:46:05.186 --> 02:46:06.767]  There's no teleprompter, there's no nothing.
[02:46:07.227 --> 02:46:08.908]  It's real life, happening as it happens.
[02:46:09.188 --> 02:46:11.050]  That's what's funny, people think they're like, somebody tell me what to do.
[02:46:11.690 --> 02:46:16.854]  I'm not even telling myself what to do, I wish I was sometimes.
[02:46:16.974 --> 02:46:22.258]  So, those viral clips of you getting all mad, yelling, you can't just turn that on for a shot?
[02:46:22.278 --> 02:46:23.899]  Because I would love to get one of those clips.
[02:46:23.939 --> 02:46:27.081]  Oh, I mean, I could turn it on, but I feel that way, so I kind of let the dog off the leash.
[02:46:27.461 --> 02:46:30.882]  Is there some like a trigger line that I say that gets you worked up?
[02:46:32.363 --> 02:46:32.883]  Like tyranny?
[02:46:32.903 --> 02:46:34.524]  People trying to dominate, take control of our lives?
[02:46:34.544 --> 02:46:35.524]  Yeah, they are.
[02:46:35.624 --> 02:46:37.305]  So, can we get a clip?
[02:46:37.565 --> 02:46:38.625]  Just a little outburst?
[02:46:39.385 --> 02:46:40.726]  I'm in a good mood right now.
[02:46:41.606 --> 02:46:42.867]  The thing is, I'm on air for hours.
[02:46:43.507 --> 02:46:46.508]  And I started thinking about Hillary ruling over my family.
[02:46:46.528 --> 02:46:49.929]  That slug, murdering piece of crap who thinks we're all her slaves and better than us.
[02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:51.330]  No, she's gonna fail.
[02:46:51.350 --> 02:46:54.011]  I just gotta think about what a piece of crap she is and Bill Clinton and all the rest of them.
[02:46:55.104 --> 02:47:01.451]  Seems like you're on the... I had a weird dream last night, like Bill Clinton was in public and Paula Jones was there on stage and he like ran over like Gollum was like grabbing on her.
[02:47:01.752 --> 02:47:02.672]  I just remembered that just now.
[02:47:02.693 --> 02:47:04.835]  I have nightmares about Bill Clinton.
[02:47:04.855 --> 02:47:07.478]  I was gonna say, I am glad I don't have those dreams.
[02:47:08.479 --> 02:47:10.760]  I gotta say, I ran into you guys yesterday.
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:12.181]  I remember all the stuff you went through.
[02:47:12.201 --> 02:47:13.221]  It was amazing.
[02:47:13.362 --> 02:47:18.844]  And you guys talked about your journey and that you guys kind of felt symbolically something magic was about to happen.
[02:47:18.864 --> 02:47:19.625]  And I thought about it.
[02:47:20.065 --> 02:47:22.866]  And then we get out here and this huge rainbow appears right when we first get here.
[02:47:22.906 --> 02:47:23.587]  It's gone now.
[02:47:24.467 --> 02:47:25.628]  And that's the sign of a new beginning.
[02:47:25.708 --> 02:47:28.890]  So we're now going to see what's about to happen in the life of you guys.
[02:47:28.910 --> 02:47:32.331]  But I think Hollywood rejecting you is a good sign, not a negative one.
[02:47:32.591 --> 02:47:37.314]  I hope you're right, because I would like some rejected checks, please.
[02:47:37.799 --> 02:47:50.647]  Yeah I think that that's what we needed at the time and you know I felt like it was divine intervention because we were at a dark place and it became really hard and challenging and we re-established a lot of relationships and brought our lives back together.
[02:47:50.707 --> 02:47:56.591]  So it was great and it wasn't worth what we were going through and I think now is a good time to move forward.
[02:47:56.611 --> 02:47:57.452]  Tell us about the baby.
[02:47:58.052 --> 02:47:59.353]  The baby is really great.
[02:47:59.413 --> 02:48:00.193]  I'm so excited.
[02:48:00.233 --> 02:48:03.374]  He's kicking and this is this is what's important in life.
[02:48:03.454 --> 02:48:11.897]  So I mean obviously we love to be successful again and whatever is meant to be but at the end of the day it's about family and your life and your values.
[02:48:12.737 --> 02:48:14.218]  I'd say this is pretty success right here.
[02:48:14.618 --> 02:48:17.719]  I mean wait till that baby's running around and everything you're gonna say this is what really matters.
[02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:21.861]  Final point I want to make here and then get to your jujitsu class is that
[02:48:23.191 --> 02:48:36.640]  They admit that, 101, they've got fake liberal bots that are paid for by Facebook, Twitter, Amazon's big into it, he's big into propaganda, Bezos, he owns Amazon.com, he got $600 million from the CIA just to run propaganda from U.S.
[02:48:36.660 --> 02:48:39.301]  taxpayers a month before Obama left office, okay?
[02:48:39.622 --> 02:48:43.384]  This info you see, they're all quarterbacking that, they think we're dumb, it's admitted.
[02:48:43.704 --> 02:48:50.389]  On Twitter, on Facebook especially, they have bots that are fake accounts that real people load stuff into, but an AI computer then
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:49:05.191]  Besides how to respond, one guy will respond to a thousand posts in a single second, and they'll tell you, oh you're nobody, everybody hates you, Trump's going down, you're scum, you're a fool, Alex is failing, Alex is going bankrupt, Alex is dying, you're gonna die, oh you're a failure, you'll never be anybody.
[02:49:05.491 --> 02:49:06.172]  And it's bots!
[02:49:06.632 --> 02:49:14.859]  But it's not just to make you be demoralized and think that the enemy's winning like Tokyo Rose and, you know, Japan saying, G.I.s, America's been defeated, your sweetheart's dead, we just took over the U.S.
[02:49:15.299 --> 02:49:15.499]  I don't
[02:49:36.351 --> 02:49:36.671]  It's all
[02:50:02.839 --> 02:50:04.440]  And that's why I turned my comments off.
[02:50:31.261 --> 02:50:32.863]  And just bomb, bomb, bomb the truth.
[02:50:32.883 --> 02:50:33.403]  Just bomb.
[02:50:33.704 --> 02:50:34.384]  So does that make sense?
[02:50:34.404 --> 02:50:44.135]  Alright, you're listening to Alex Jones talking to Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt of the Hills and he's going to be right back with more of that interview and we'll be right back with some news on the other side of this break.
[02:50:44.155 --> 02:50:44.535]  Stay with us.
[02:50:44.555 --> 02:50:45.016]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:07.591 --> 02:51:15.025]  I hope the mainstream media feels powerful when you know this is all going on and you do everything you can to lie about what this show broadcasts, what we cover.
[02:51:15.906 --> 02:51:16.828]  The blood of those children.
[02:51:17.938 --> 02:51:19.539]  All over the world held in captivity.
[02:51:19.880 --> 02:51:22.702]  UN caught kidnapping thousands out of Haiti alone.
[02:51:23.703 --> 02:51:25.084]  The blood is on your hands.
[02:51:25.164 --> 02:51:26.806]  Leo Zegami, let me ask you this question.
[02:51:27.386 --> 02:51:35.594]  Who is behind this global sudden wave of thousands of thousands of pedophiles per country being caught?
[02:51:36.114 --> 02:51:37.355]  10,000 plus arrests here.
[02:51:37.695 --> 02:51:44.081]  What is causing this massive move against pedophile rings that even MSM admits may bring down the Catholic Church?
[02:51:44.281 --> 02:51:51.824]  Well, it's happening and it's happening clearly in front of the whole world with George Pell, but it's also an internal conflict.
[02:51:51.945 --> 02:52:11.133]  A few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican, we had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the Holy Office, the ex-Inquisition, now known as the Congregation for the Matters of Faith, basically the headquarters of the most holy office in the Vatican.
[02:52:11.353 --> 02:52:13.094]  The police broke in and found
[02:52:13.214 --> 02:52:14.315]  We're good.
[02:52:29.224 --> 02:52:42.555]  Cardinal Pell is responsible for many decades of secret plan devised by the Vatican to give the less possible money to the victims of pedophilia and manipulate them.
[02:52:42.756 --> 02:52:49.602]  And he was made a member of the C9 group, which is a group of nine cardinals.
[02:52:50.543 --> 02:52:58.654]  And three of these cardinals have been heavily criticized for having protected in the past pedophilia, including Cardinal Pell.
[02:52:59.014 --> 02:53:05.383]  So many people were actually astonished of seeing in February 2014 Cardinal Pell arriving in Rome.
[02:53:05.983 --> 02:53:12.990]  And he didn't really hide in front of the media or, you know, in front of the other people in the Vatican.
[02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:27.545]  He started immediately acting with a lavish lifestyle that, of course, brought a lot of criticism towards Pope Francis, who wants to be this very conservative pope who doesn't spend much money.
[02:53:27.665 --> 02:53:28.205]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:53:57.726 --> 02:53:59.658]  He's put in front of a trial.
[02:54:15.911 --> 02:54:17.152]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!

[02:54:25.519 --> 02:54:33.985]  Just to remind you, as we're getting close to the end of July, that this special that we've had since the 4th of July, our Independence special, is starting to come to a close.
[02:54:34.045 --> 02:54:35.306]  It's going to be closing very soon.

[02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:38.969]  We're good to go.
[02:54:38.989 --> 02:54:39.369]  We're good to go.
[02:54:39.389 --> 02:54:39.970]  We're good to go.
[02:54:40.050 --> 02:54:40.530]  We're good to go.
[02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:41.171]  We're good to go.
[02:54:41.191 --> 02:54:41.611]  We're good to go.
[02:54:41.691 --> 02:54:42.211]  We're good to go.

[02:55:11.810 --> 02:55:15.852]  That's a very expensive supplement, very expensive for us to produce it, a very unique

[02:55:18.453 --> 02:55:19.493]  That's 20% off.
[02:55:19.513 --> 02:55:21.174]  That's a big dollar savings.
[02:55:21.454 --> 02:55:23.675]  And of course, free shipping store-wide.
[02:55:23.695 --> 02:55:36.640]  Let's go back and finish the rest of this interview that Alex Jones had in Hawaii with Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt of The Hills, talking about globalism, talking about the Hollywood elite, and talking about reality television.
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:37.620]  Here's the rest of that interview.
[02:55:38.140 --> 02:55:39.341]  Bomb, bomb, bomb the truth.
[02:55:39.361 --> 02:55:39.881]  Just bomb.
[02:55:40.181 --> 02:55:40.961]  So does that make sense?
[02:55:41.222 --> 02:55:42.182]  It does make sense.
[02:55:42.382 --> 02:55:44.543]  And sometimes I feel like a bot.
[02:55:45.834 --> 02:55:50.615]  You're not a bot, because you guys broke with the Matrix right at the height of your career and said, let's go on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:50.655 --> 02:55:51.835]  And at first I was like, is this fake?
[02:55:51.855 --> 02:55:53.356]  And then behind the scenes, you're like, hey, come out.
[02:55:53.396 --> 02:55:53.796]  Let's hang out.
[02:55:53.816 --> 02:55:54.256]  I love your film.
[02:55:54.276 --> 02:55:54.836]  I love this part.
[02:55:54.996 --> 02:55:56.577]  We're going to fight the New World Order of microchips.
[02:55:56.777 --> 02:55:58.937]  I think I even had a few conversations with you, quite a few.
[02:55:58.957 --> 02:56:00.478]  And I was like, dude, they're going to come after you.
[02:56:00.518 --> 02:56:01.618]  You sure you want to do this?
[02:56:01.658 --> 02:56:02.718]  You definitely warned us.
[02:56:02.818 --> 02:56:04.318]  And I was like, we're fine.
[02:56:04.359 --> 02:56:04.979]  We're fine.
[02:56:05.459 --> 02:56:05.619]  No.
[02:56:05.919 --> 02:56:09.800]  What's crazy, if we want to go like dark, dark, you know, multiple people
[02:56:10.620 --> 02:56:11.221]  I don't know.
[02:56:33.444 --> 02:56:35.105]  We actually... Go ahead and say it.
[02:56:35.165 --> 02:56:37.165]  No, we left to Costa Rica.
[02:56:37.205 --> 02:56:38.186]  We were gonna move there.
[02:56:38.346 --> 02:56:40.186]  And we left all our stuff.
[02:56:40.306 --> 02:56:43.928]  Yeah, and because we were... Yeah, we were concerned.
[02:56:43.968 --> 02:56:47.249]  We were scared that we were gonna get, like, off Michael Jackson style.
[02:56:47.289 --> 02:56:48.729]  Like, oh, they're crazy.
[02:56:48.809 --> 02:56:49.970]  Oh, the Starkiller stuff's real.
[02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:56.672]  When a star... They have an actuary, a forming one, when a star peaks, and they know they're about to die or whatever, but they know it makes the whole catalog worth double or triple.
[02:56:56.952 --> 02:57:01.434]  So the catalog's already worth $5 billion, and you kill somebody and it's worth $15 billion instead of nothing.
[02:57:02.034 --> 02:57:03.874]  Thankfully we had no catalog to take off.
[02:57:03.894 --> 02:57:07.995]  We were like, we're not going to get a dollar off these two being dead.
[02:57:08.055 --> 02:57:09.776]  But we did start feeling that momentum.
[02:57:09.836 --> 02:57:13.977]  So that's one of the reasons that we left and just dropped out of everything and took our dogs.
[02:57:14.057 --> 02:57:16.017]  And it was just, it was a scary time.
[02:57:16.277 --> 02:57:19.538]  I've run into people just separately trying to think they can create a catalog and then kill me.
[02:57:19.958 --> 02:57:22.299]  And you're like, and they're actually like in front of you preparing it.
[02:57:22.519 --> 02:57:23.979]  And you figure out they're doing it and you're like, no.
[02:57:24.339 --> 02:57:25.200]  I mean, people are crazy.
[02:57:25.220 --> 02:57:26.060]  They don't want to build something.
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:26.680]  They want to steal it.
[02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:29.301]  Yeah, no, it's, it's, people are scary.
[02:57:29.321 --> 02:57:30.781]  It's a scary world, so.
[02:57:31.221 --> 02:57:36.142]  Alright guys, well listen, you're awesome, and hopefully we do another interview this week while you're here.
[02:57:36.162 --> 02:57:36.683]  Yeah, we're here.
[02:57:36.703 --> 02:57:37.143]  Great to see you.
[02:57:37.163 --> 02:57:37.663]  Thanks a lot, guys.
[02:57:37.743 --> 02:57:38.603]  I'll see you at the pool.
[02:57:38.663 --> 02:57:40.804]  Hey, bring the rainbow again next time though.
[02:57:40.864 --> 02:57:41.144]  Absolutely.
[02:57:41.164 --> 02:57:43.064]  If I was Trendy, see, I'd just diss them that cool.
[02:57:43.264 --> 02:57:48.286]  But because the enemy demonizes them, aww, they're good.
[02:57:48.306 --> 02:57:52.127]  Trendy, I don't think you get too much love dissing us now.
[02:57:52.147 --> 02:57:52.927]  People got a coup.
[02:57:53.387 --> 02:57:54.427]  I think they unplugged us.
[02:57:54.507 --> 02:57:54.968]  Are you kidding?
[02:57:55.428 --> 02:57:58.609]  Every woman I've run into is going, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[02:57:58.669 --> 02:57:58.949]  Wow, OK.
[02:57:58.989 --> 02:57:59.790]  Thanks for the pump up.
[02:57:59.890 --> 02:58:00.670]  We needed that.
[02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:02.911]  Yeah, our own social media that we get now.
[02:58:03.231 --> 02:58:04.612]  That's the good thing about it, that we didn't have to.
[02:58:04.632 --> 02:58:05.552]  No, I mean, they all remember the show.
[02:58:05.572 --> 02:58:06.252]  They remember you guys.
[02:58:06.652 --> 02:58:07.613]  All right, stay with us.
[02:58:07.633 --> 02:58:10.374]  We're going to be coming back with Paul Joseph Watson on the other side of this break.
[02:58:10.914 --> 02:58:17.985]  I'm talking about the timeline and the context for what's going on with the House IT scandal and the DNC.
[02:58:18.045 --> 02:58:19.567]  And of course, it's more than just a scandal.
[02:58:20.068 --> 02:58:23.954]  This is about possible espionage and proven theft.
[02:58:23.974 --> 02:58:24.615]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:24.635 --> 02:58:25.016]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.564 --> 02:58:45.369]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:55.782 --> 02:58:56.723]  Why is the mold?
[02:58:56.863 --> 02:58:58.304]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:58:58.604 --> 02:58:59.424]  What is going on?
[02:58:59.565 --> 02:59:00.325]  What has changed?
[02:59:24.641 --> 02:59:26.022]  We only have a limited supply of this.

[02:59:48.958 --> 02:59:50.379]  We're changing the world together.
[02:59:50.439 --> 02:59:51.419]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:59:51.439 --> 02:59:52.180]  God bless you all.
[02:59:55.379 --> 02:59:59.481]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:00:00.022 --> 03:00:01.342]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.309 --> 03:00:13.229]  You found it.
[03:00:13.549 --> 03:00:15.130]  The tip of the spear.
[03:00:15.590 --> 03:00:19.973]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[03:00:21.843 --> 03:00:23.205]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:23.225 --> 03:00:26.269]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us in the next segment for the fourth hour.
[03:00:26.909 --> 03:00:36.621]  In this short segment, I want to try to break down some of the timeline, some of the context for what's happened with Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC, what we've just learned in the last couple of days.
[03:00:36.681 --> 03:00:37.462]  It's very large, folks.
[03:00:38.103 --> 03:01:07.983]  Of course we had less than a week ago we found that the FBI had raided an IT worker who's been there's been a long series of articles by the Daily Caller and a few other outlets we've covered it ourselves as well but of course the mainstream media has ignored this thoroughly and we started talking about the ghost employees the people that were getting paid a hundred and sixty thousand plus the family the brothers who came from Pakistan this is more about four to five times more than what the typical IT worker was getting
[03:01:08.463 --> 03:01:24.580]  This family got over four million dollars in just a couple of years, and even as scandals began to crop up, even as they were being investigated by the Capitol Police for theft of equipment, Debbie Wasserman Schultz refused to fire this guy who was just arrested trying to leave the country.
[03:01:25.081 --> 03:01:27.103]  After wiring $283,000 to Pakistan, he said it first for a funeral.
[03:01:31.187 --> 03:01:32.288]  The question is, whose funeral?
[03:01:32.708 --> 03:01:33.008]  His?
[03:01:33.869 --> 03:01:35.310]  From the Clinton people?
[03:01:35.890 --> 03:01:41.093]  Or the funeral of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the political funeral of those people?
[03:01:41.753 --> 03:01:48.177]  This is something that his wife left in March, and of course she was stopped at the airport as she was going back to Pakistan.
[03:01:48.378 --> 03:01:50.059]  She had over $16,000 in cash.
[03:01:50.099 --> 03:01:55.202]  You think you and I would be allowed to leave if they were suspicious of something and were carrying that amount of money?
[03:01:55.842 --> 03:02:01.145]  It was 25 years ago when I first saw one of the first civil asset forfeiture cases that I saw.
[03:02:01.165 --> 03:02:03.927]  And of course, this was a black man who had a business.
[03:02:03.987 --> 03:02:12.692]  He would fly one way to another country, another state rather, and he would buy some equipment that he would then drive back in a truck.
[03:02:12.712 --> 03:02:17.896]  He'd rent a truck and buy, it was gardening and landscaping stuff that he would buy, supplies.
[03:02:18.576 --> 03:02:19.397]  And fly that back.
[03:02:19.417 --> 03:02:22.259]  Well, he went at the last minute because he didn't make a lot of plans.
[03:02:22.679 --> 03:02:26.062]  Went at the last minute, paid for cash, paid for his ticket in cash.
[03:02:26.722 --> 03:02:30.525]  And the person who sold him the ticket alerted the airport officials.
[03:02:30.565 --> 03:02:32.226]  They confiscated all of his cash.
[03:02:32.266 --> 03:02:34.448]  He was not involved in anything criminal.
[03:02:34.928 --> 03:02:38.011]  But of course, they can just charge the cash and take it without charging you with a crime.
[03:02:38.031 --> 03:02:42.714]  But this lady, the wife of this individual, was allowed to leave with $16,000 in cash.
[03:02:42.734 --> 03:02:44.676]  He had a big stash of cash on him as well.
[03:02:45.036 --> 03:02:45.977]  Was going to Pakistan.
[03:02:46.337 --> 03:02:50.498]  Now this was just a couple of days after the FBI had finally moved to take a look at these disk drives.
[03:02:50.538 --> 03:02:53.938]  And remember, the DNC refused to turn over disk drives for quite some time.
[03:02:53.958 --> 03:02:56.419]  I don't think they've still turned over all the disk drives.
[03:02:56.999 --> 03:03:00.219]  But they learned that this individual had disk drives that had been stolen.
[03:03:00.359 --> 03:03:02.480]  When they finally got to them, they had been smashed.
[03:03:02.500 --> 03:03:07.521]  And so this reminds me of the story that you've all heard about the individual who is crossing the border.
[03:03:07.561 --> 03:03:10.401]  Sometimes it's with a bicycle, sometimes it's with a wheelbarrow, or whatever.
[03:03:10.421 --> 03:03:12.462]  They are trying to figure out what he's doing.
[03:03:12.502 --> 03:03:15.022]  They think he's smuggling something, but they're not quite sure.
[03:03:15.834 --> 03:03:21.418]  And they keep stopping him and looking, he's on the bicycle, and eventually they realize he's smuggling bicycles.
[03:03:22.018 --> 03:03:28.183]  See, when he stole these disk drives, they weren't interested in reselling the used computer equipment.
[03:03:28.783 --> 03:03:34.828]  They were interested in what was on the disk drives, information, and then they don't want anybody to see what they were collecting there.
[03:03:34.868 --> 03:03:35.708]  So they smashed this.
[03:03:35.728 --> 03:03:44.255]  Now we've had Representative Stephen King saying this individual, Imran Awan, had access to all the communications of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
[03:03:44.955 --> 03:03:47.256]  That should be very troubling if we know who he is.
[03:03:48.156 --> 03:03:53.219]  This is somebody who was guilty of blackmailing his stepmother.
[03:03:53.759 --> 03:04:04.043]  She went to the police, she had to have a translator, because she didn't even speak English, but she was saying, he's threatening me and saying that they're going to kidnap my relatives back in Pakistan if I don't turn this over.
[03:04:04.083 --> 03:04:11.246]  Nevertheless, we have Democrat congressmen saying, this is nothing but Islamophobia, and this is the tact of defense that's being taken by his lawyer.
[03:04:11.706 --> 03:04:12.467]  Who is his lawyer?
[03:04:13.027 --> 03:04:18.509]  His lawyer is Chris Gowan, who said, this is clearly a right-wing, media-driven prosecution by the U.S.
[03:04:18.549 --> 03:04:21.970]  Attorney's Office that wants to prosecute people for working while Muslim.
[03:04:22.470 --> 03:04:27.931]  No, it was actually his relatives, his Muslim relatives that were being blackmailed by him.
[03:04:28.191 --> 03:04:31.973]  This is an individual, by the way, this attorney, who worked for the Bill Clinton White House.
[03:04:32.093 --> 03:04:33.713]  He worked for Senator Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:33.753 --> 03:04:35.654]  He worked on her 2008 campaign.
[03:04:35.874 --> 03:04:40.095]  He worked for the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, the Clinton Library.
[03:04:41.223 --> 03:04:53.407]  There's a lot of corruption going on here, folks, and when we see these people blackmailing, having access to the communications of the Foreign Affairs Committee, having access to all these Democrats, the question is, who were they blackmailing?
[03:04:53.867 --> 03:04:55.667]  They were sending this information off-site.
[03:04:55.687 --> 03:04:59.089]  We'll have more information about this tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:04:59.109 --> 03:05:00.229]  Paul Joseph Watson, coming up.
[03:05:03.698 --> 03:05:15.828]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[03:05:16.009 --> 03:05:23.375]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWars Life family, true whey protein from InfoWars Life.
[03:05:23.715 --> 03:05:29.637]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high-quality organic conditions.
[03:05:30.217 --> 03:05:36.940]  Our True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life contains a whopping 20 grams of protein per serving.
[03:05:37.400 --> 03:05:44.623]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[03:05:44.763 --> 03:05:52.806]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies to bring you a super
[03:05:53.206 --> 03:05:57.408]  High quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[03:05:57.928 --> 03:06:05.491]  That way you get the benefits and the taste of high quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[03:06:05.811 --> 03:06:08.292]  Doing our research, one thing continued to really stand out.
[03:06:08.872 --> 03:06:17.556]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[03:06:17.956 --> 03:06:18.756]  That is essential.
[03:06:19.156 --> 03:06:23.438]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[03:06:23.938 --> 03:06:26.379]  This is the very best way that we were able to bring to market.
[03:06:26.739 --> 03:06:28.440]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[03:06:28.540 --> 03:06:30.201]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.

[03:08:09.666 --> 03:08:10.566]  You found it.
[03:08:10.906 --> 03:08:12.407]  The tip of the spear.
[03:08:12.947 --> 03:08:15.388]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:15.949 --> 03:08:19.890]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:24.642 --> 03:08:25.142]  We're live!
[03:08:25.182 --> 03:08:30.466]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, and the map has gone for the time being.
[03:08:30.506 --> 03:08:34.389]  It will be back, but in its place is the Nazi haircut, as you can see.
[03:08:34.409 --> 03:08:51.420]  If you go to my Twitter, actually, I can show you what I'm talking about when I say Nazi haircut, because The Root, which is a big online publication, big left-wing news outlet, actually did an article a few months ago where they said Eric Trump was probably a Nazi.
[03:08:51.580 --> 03:08:54.122]  Literally put him next to a picture of Hitler,
[03:08:54.922 --> 03:09:00.809]  Because he got a haircut, which was a shaved back and sides with a bit of length on top.
[03:09:01.309 --> 03:09:02.751]  There you see one of the tweets.
[03:09:02.811 --> 03:09:07.616]  If you scroll down a bit, there's a tweet a few hours ago I put out.
[03:09:09.192 --> 03:09:10.013]  Probably not that one.
[03:09:11.133 --> 03:09:12.754]  But it's the Root Magazine.
[03:09:13.034 --> 03:09:16.277]  Literally they said that Eric Trump was probably a Nazi.
[03:09:16.317 --> 03:09:17.858]  Put his picture next to Hitler.
[03:09:17.898 --> 03:09:18.558]  There you see it.
[03:09:19.338 --> 03:09:21.020]  Next to Richard Spencer also.
[03:09:21.520 --> 03:09:22.921]  Because he got this haircut.
[03:09:23.441 --> 03:09:27.724]  Which is, by the way, the most universally fashionable haircut.
[03:09:28.044 --> 03:09:33.526]  Amongst men aged, what, 18 to 40 right now in the entire Western world.
[03:09:33.786 --> 03:09:37.868]  But no, that's not why Eric Trump got that haircut.
[03:09:38.148 --> 03:09:39.729]  That's not why I got that haircut.
[03:09:39.749 --> 03:09:43.250]  We got it because we're alt-right fascists and we're literally Hitler.
[03:09:43.310 --> 03:09:44.771]  That's why we got that haircut.
[03:09:45.051 --> 03:09:51.373]  That was an actual serious news article that was published on the internet and people believed it.
[03:09:51.794 --> 03:09:58.096]  This is the level of the hysteria that we're dealing with and we're going to get into more of that later here on the show.
[03:09:59.236 --> 03:10:06.279]  First up, Gateway Pundit reports, Hillary Clinton is getting mercilessly roasted over her book title, What Happened?
[03:10:06.759 --> 03:10:07.980]  So yes, Hillary Clinton
[03:10:09.184 --> 03:10:20.267]  In between whining about Russians and Wikileaks and Alex Jones and Infowars, she's released yet another book, despite the fact that they always bomb because nobody gives a damn about what she has to say anymore.
[03:10:20.928 --> 03:10:24.609]  She's released yet another book called What Happened?
[03:10:25.209 --> 03:10:32.571]  Well, a few people on Twitter, on social media, had their own version of What Happened, and you can see some of them in this article.
[03:10:33.071 --> 03:10:35.492]  One of them simply says, Shlonged?
[03:10:36.112 --> 03:10:38.333]  That's what happened to Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[03:10:39.363 --> 03:10:41.424]  There's a whole list of reasons of what happened.
[03:10:41.505 --> 03:10:47.809]  Hillary getting thrown into the side of a van like a side of beef back in September last year, that's what happened.
[03:10:49.290 --> 03:10:52.412]  Hillary's 30,000 deleted emails, that's what happened.
[03:10:52.492 --> 03:10:52.913]  Hillary...
[03:10:54.116 --> 03:10:56.417]  Rigging the primaries, that's what happened.
[03:10:56.817 --> 03:10:59.619]  Her awful campaign strategy, that's what happened.
[03:10:59.819 --> 03:11:01.540]  Benghazi, that's what happened.
[03:11:01.780 --> 03:11:03.361]  The fact that she's a liar, a criminal.
[03:11:03.401 --> 03:11:05.022]  The fact that she abandoned Wisconsin.
[03:11:05.042 --> 03:11:07.083]  The fact that she called blacks super predators.
[03:11:07.423 --> 03:11:10.244]  The fact that she called half of America deplorables.
[03:11:10.585 --> 03:11:12.386]  That's what happened, Hillary!
[03:11:13.266 --> 03:11:25.730]  But now she's got a new book making more excuses about why she lost the election, blaming imaginary Russian conspiracy theories, no doubt, blaming WikiLeaks, blaming InfoWars.
[03:11:26.210 --> 03:11:28.031]  People have got their own version of what happened.
[03:11:28.051 --> 03:11:36.074]  And in fact, this was an idea mentioned to me shortly before I came on the show here by Laura Luma, who works over at The Rebel.
[03:11:37.284 --> 03:11:38.765]  Now, we're going to talk to Alex about this.
[03:11:38.805 --> 03:11:40.146]  I'm just going to float this right now.
[03:11:40.166 --> 03:11:43.428]  This is not an official announcement, obviously, because we need to talk about this.
[03:11:44.069 --> 03:11:53.014]  If Hillary Clinton has book signings for this book, which will probably happen, should we troll Hillary Clinton?
[03:11:53.034 --> 03:11:55.116]  That's the question I'm asking on the show today.
[03:11:55.496 --> 03:12:02.241]  Should we have people show up, politely, buy her book at any particular book signing that she attends,
[03:12:03.416 --> 03:12:07.579]  And tell Hillary what happened, or at least ask her the question, what happened?
[03:12:07.979 --> 03:12:10.681]  What happened to your 30,000 emails, Hillary?
[03:12:11.001 --> 03:12:12.402]  What happened in Benghazi?
[03:12:13.062 --> 03:12:15.264]  What happened to all the money for Haiti?
[03:12:15.624 --> 03:12:16.585]  What happened there?
[03:12:17.005 --> 03:12:31.895]  What happened to the fact that a fifth of your campaign, at least, was funded by Saudi Arabia, a country that still stones gay people to death, and yet your daughter was out on Twitter yesterday virtue signalling about how much she cares about LGBT issues.
[03:12:32.335 --> 03:12:33.136]  What happened with that?
[03:12:33.756 --> 03:12:39.638]  Maybe we should have people show up at these events and ask Hillary directly what happened in all those cases.
[03:12:39.958 --> 03:12:45.820]  What happened Hillary when you intimidated and abused Bill Clinton's rape victims?
[03:12:46.020 --> 03:12:46.860]  What happened there?
[03:12:46.880 --> 03:12:52.642]  A lot of questions as to what happened in regards to Hillary Clinton isn't there and maybe we should ask her.
[03:12:53.729 --> 03:12:54.889]  Should we have a contest?
[03:12:55.049 --> 03:12:56.350]  This is not an official announcement.
[03:12:56.370 --> 03:12:57.290]  I'm floating the idea.
[03:12:57.670 --> 03:13:04.011]  Should we have a contest for the best confrontation of Hillary Clinton asking her what happened?
[03:13:04.391 --> 03:13:08.112]  Of course, it's completely dependent on if she does any actual book signings.
[03:13:08.492 --> 03:13:13.213]  We know for a fact that Hillary basically hates humans, so it might not happen.
[03:13:13.253 --> 03:13:21.555]  She might not want to actually meet them, God forbid, in public and, you know, touch them and have to speak to the scum, to the plebs.
[03:13:22.549 --> 03:13:25.014]  Is she actually doing any book signings for this book?
[03:13:25.034 --> 03:13:25.836]  We're going to find out.
[03:13:25.916 --> 03:13:28.642]  It was an idea that was presented to me literally 10 minutes ago.
[03:13:29.223 --> 03:13:30.486]  I think a very smart one.
[03:13:31.638 --> 03:13:35.061]  And we may indeed find out what happened in all those cases.
[03:13:35.101 --> 03:13:36.843]  Of course, she's not going to answer the questions.
[03:13:37.783 --> 03:13:41.266]  But it could be a nice little troll politely asking the question again.
[03:13:41.306 --> 03:13:43.648]  The left will probably freak out about this now.
[03:13:44.049 --> 03:13:50.514]  Newsweek will write articles saying that we're calling for civil war because we dare ask Hillary Clinton a question.
[03:13:51.015 --> 03:13:53.076]  But I think that's a very interesting proposal.
[03:13:53.777 --> 03:13:55.339]  And it may indeed come to fruition.
[03:13:55.379 --> 03:13:56.940]  So I'm going to flow that idea now.
[03:13:56.980 --> 03:13:58.662]  Let's see if it comes into effect.
[03:13:59.342 --> 03:14:04.207]  Let's see if she actually does any book signings because it's completely dependent on that.
[03:14:05.885 --> 03:14:13.251]  Moving on, Westmonster reports Muslim gang attacked strangers in Liverpool for being white, non-Muslims.
[03:14:13.291 --> 03:14:28.022]  You turn the tables on this, can you imagine for a second, given all the hysteria, given all the fake news about hate crime sweeping Britain after Brexit, which is a complete hoax, reports of hate crime have increased.
[03:14:28.463 --> 03:14:30.584]  Actual documented examples haven't.
[03:14:30.925 --> 03:14:33.567]  Then when you drill down into what they classify as a hate crime,
[03:14:34.167 --> 03:14:45.589]  I mean, you basically had Wiltshire Police in the UK a couple of days ago saying that they would track down, they literally used those words, track down people who said mean things on Twitter.
[03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:56.632]  No, it's not as if we've got acid attacks, not as if we've got stabbings, not as if we've got terrorism taking place, in some cases every day in some areas of the UK right now, no.
[03:14:56.892 --> 03:15:01.393]  They're going to go after people who wrote offensive things on Twitter.
[03:15:02.293 --> 03:15:03.113]  Hate crimes.
[03:15:03.233 --> 03:15:05.134]  That's what they're defining it as now.
[03:15:05.994 --> 03:15:14.596]  Imagine if a group of white people had rampaged through the streets of a major city in the UK attacking Muslims for being Muslim.
[03:15:15.057 --> 03:15:17.657]  It would be a nationwide outrage.
[03:15:17.977 --> 03:15:20.038]  Non-stop media coverage.
[03:15:21.138 --> 03:15:27.442]  You flip the tables, a group of Muslims attack white people specifically because they're not Muslims, which happened.
[03:15:27.982 --> 03:15:34.005]  The national broadcaster of the country, the BBC, hasn't even reported on it.
[03:15:34.726 --> 03:15:46.813]  The mafia that we all pay hundreds of pounds to every year not to get a knock on the door from their goons, not to get a criminal record, taxpayer funded, they're not reporting on this at all.
[03:15:47.313 --> 03:15:50.035]  Nothing, zip, nada, zilch.
[03:15:51.570 --> 03:15:59.934]  A gang of Muslim yobs had been jailed following vicious attacks on strangers in Liverpool town centre because they were, quote, white non-Muslims.
[03:16:00.695 --> 03:16:10.740]  Amin Mohamed, Mohamed Patel and Farooq Patel were caught after a passerby saw them attacking a man and using racist language talking about Muslims and Christians.
[03:16:11.200 --> 03:16:18.764]  One of the gang asked the man if he was a Muslim, to which he replied that he was, before being asked by the gang, well, what's the Muslim word?
[03:16:20.031 --> 03:16:23.672]  He replied with a well-known Arabic phrase, there is only one God, Mohammed is the messenger.
[03:16:24.012 --> 03:16:25.812]  He was allowed to leave.
[03:16:26.112 --> 03:16:29.313]  The gang then cornered another man, asking him, what are you?
[03:16:29.653 --> 03:16:32.494]  The victim was confused, but when one of them said, I'm a Muslim, what are you?
[03:16:32.554 --> 03:16:34.875]  He answered, I'm a Christian.
[03:16:35.495 --> 03:16:44.097]  The scumbags then assaulted the man, breaking his glasses and causing a cut above his eye, all while shouting, quote, why aren't you a Muslim?
[03:16:46.343 --> 03:16:50.749]  This is the Sharia law patrol that we're increasingly seeing on the streets of the UK.
[03:16:51.170 --> 03:16:59.001]  Beatdowns, violent assaults, policing of behaviour for people who aren't Muslims in British cities.
[03:16:59.522 --> 03:17:02.065]  A Labour councillor was also beaten by the men.
[03:17:03.097 --> 03:17:07.501]  He was walking through the town with his girlfriend, as was a passerby who tried to intervene.
[03:17:07.561 --> 03:17:10.644]  He was taken to hospital and treated for bruising and bleeding to his eyes.
[03:17:11.225 --> 03:17:19.693]  Judge Louise Brandon said, quote, This was a disgraceful and sustained campaign of violence carried out on the streets of this city.
[03:17:20.663 --> 03:17:25.007]  Mohammed confessed to, quote, targeting people because they were white and non-Muslim.
[03:17:25.067 --> 03:17:26.848]  That's a direct quote.
[03:17:27.709 --> 03:17:35.195]  Farooq told officers he filmed the attacks because he thought it was, quote, funny, and described it as, quote, a laugh.
[03:17:36.738 --> 03:17:39.019]  Mohammed Crider was jailed for 42 weeks.
[03:17:39.499 --> 03:17:43.880]  Patel received 42 and 18 weeks respectively in a young offenders institution.
[03:17:44.100 --> 03:17:46.340]  So they're not even going to be in jail for a year.
[03:17:46.360 --> 03:17:56.743]  They'll probably be out in three months after vicious hate crime attacks on white people because they're not Muslims on the streets of a British city.
[03:17:57.383 --> 03:18:03.225]  Not a scintilla of coverage from the country's national broadcaster, the BBC.
[03:18:04.446 --> 03:18:09.588]  Oh, but the focus now has become a Muslim man stopped them from attacking someone.
[03:18:10.048 --> 03:18:14.190]  So, oh, we've found a reason to bow down and worship Islam once again.
[03:18:14.690 --> 03:18:22.853]  They've even managed to squeeze that out of a story where a Muslim mob is attacking white people because they're not Muslims.
[03:18:23.073 --> 03:18:27.355]  They managed to squeeze a pro-Islam narrative out of even that.
[03:18:29.738 --> 03:18:32.241]  And the BBC is not reporting on it at all.
[03:18:32.982 --> 03:18:34.263]  I'm going to do an article about that.
[03:18:34.303 --> 03:18:45.857]  We will see if we can pressure the top national taxpayer-funded broadcaster to report on a rampant hate crime, mob, rage,
[03:18:46.798 --> 03:18:48.319]  That we saw on the streets of Liverpool.
[03:18:48.959 --> 03:18:49.999]  It's been reported elsewhere.
[03:18:50.019 --> 03:18:51.860]  It's not being reported by the BBC.
[03:18:52.120 --> 03:19:00.164]  If that was white people attacking Muslims because they were Muslim, brutally assaulting them, would be a national news story for weeks.
[03:19:02.305 --> 03:19:02.725]  Nothing.
[03:19:03.005 --> 03:19:04.006]  Absolutely nothing.
[03:19:05.386 --> 03:19:06.267]  Another story here.
[03:19:07.765 --> 03:19:14.248]  In terms of cultural enrichment, failed Afghan asylum seeker who wanted to kill Germans allowed to stay!
[03:19:14.268 --> 03:19:17.370]  Oh, what could possibly go wrong?
[03:19:17.390 --> 03:19:21.652]  A failed Afghan asylum seeker who said he wanted to kill Germans
[03:19:22.628 --> 03:19:22.868]  Yeah.
[03:19:23.849 --> 03:19:24.710]  Great integration.
[03:19:24.810 --> 03:19:26.432]  Multiculturalism working great, isn't it?
[03:19:26.692 --> 03:19:29.455]  Has been allowed to stay in the country following an appeal.
[03:19:30.076 --> 03:19:40.187]  Assef N, again they don't give the full names because they protect them, was arrested two months ago at a college in Nuremberg with a view to being deported, however, following riots from far-left students.
[03:19:40.487 --> 03:19:41.949]  Oh, they came to his aid.
[03:19:42.449 --> 03:19:45.010]  He lodged an appeal, tried to claim asylum.
[03:19:45.310 --> 03:19:55.013]  He was successful in doing so thanks to left wingers protesting in his favor after he said he wanted to kill Germans.
[03:19:55.253 --> 03:19:56.474]  Absolutely despicable.
[03:19:56.494 --> 03:19:57.914]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:19:57.934 --> 03:20:03.656]  Stay tuned.
[03:20:05.816 --> 03:20:10.158]  Every article, every video, but especially these articles and videos, we've been breaking down.
[03:20:11.778 --> 03:20:18.364]  Dealing with the martial law, civil war, assassination, removal, sudden removal, coup of Trump.
[03:20:18.845 --> 03:20:20.726]  All of this is now confirmed.
[03:20:21.087 --> 03:20:23.909]  Talk about sensationally fantastic.
[03:20:25.325 --> 03:20:27.006]  Talk about living in incredible times.
[03:20:27.087 --> 03:20:30.329]  Talk about America and the world at the crossroads.
[03:20:30.369 --> 03:20:30.910]  This is it.
[03:20:31.870 --> 03:20:34.493]  And now, more than ever, we need your financial support.
[03:20:34.553 --> 03:20:36.514]  We have the very best products you need.
[03:20:36.935 --> 03:20:39.417]  Incredible air filtration systems that are $219.
[03:20:39.477 --> 03:20:39.857]  Similar units are $400, $600.
[03:20:39.917 --> 03:20:41.098]  Used to be like $800 a few years ago.
[03:20:41.118 --> 03:20:42.039]  The prices are going down.
[03:20:42.059 --> 03:20:42.579]  They're $149 right now.
[03:20:49.585 --> 03:20:50.726]  $149, normally $219.
[03:20:51.747 --> 03:20:53.208]  That is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:20:53.328 --> 03:20:56.290]  The very same type systems, again, are $400 on average, upwards of $600.
[03:20:56.450 --> 03:20:59.693]  ProPure Travel are the very best gravity-fed systems out there.
[03:20:59.713 --> 03:21:01.034]  30% off, $132.
[03:21:01.334 --> 03:21:04.797]  The other competitors aren't even as good, and they sell them for $200, $230.
[03:21:04.857 --> 03:21:05.257]  That's $132 right now.
[03:21:07.839 --> 03:21:11.042]  Super Silver Special, the electric toothbrush that has silver impregnated in it.
[03:21:11.442 --> 03:21:11.902]  Amazing.
[03:21:12.082 --> 03:21:13.904]  And the Ployol Silver toothpaste.
[03:21:14.424 --> 03:21:16.045]  Super Blue and the Silver Bullet.
[03:21:16.126 --> 03:21:18.027]  Ployol Silver, 50% off.
[03:21:18.287 --> 03:21:19.388]  We've never done a special that big.
[03:21:19.728 --> 03:21:21.310]  Caveman Combo, 25% off.
[03:21:21.330 --> 03:21:24.272]  The Bone Broth, Super Female, 57% off.
[03:21:24.332 --> 03:21:24.972]  And why is that?
[03:21:25.052 --> 03:21:27.054]  Because we're basically sold out of the Super Male.
[03:21:27.174 --> 03:21:28.095]  I can't discount that.
[03:21:28.395 --> 03:21:31.177]  Super Female is very, very similar and works on men as well.
[03:21:31.217 --> 03:21:32.078]  But I want women.
[03:21:32.098 --> 03:21:33.439]  I've never really caught on with women for some reason.
[03:21:33.439 --> 03:21:33.919]  We're good to go.
[03:22:04.045 --> 03:22:13.271]  Ruthless offshore elites use their corporate liberal media to attack and demonize any Americans or any independent news that dare challenge their lives.
[03:22:13.872 --> 03:22:17.054]  Five companies own over 90% of the media.
[03:22:17.474 --> 03:22:23.959]  And that's why, whether it's comedy shows, award shows, Hollywood, TV entertainment, the news, it doesn't matter.
[03:22:24.279 --> 03:22:32.305]  It's all focused in one anti-American, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-gun voice.
[03:22:33.105 --> 03:22:33.826]  And it gets worse.
[03:22:34.187 --> 03:22:45.298]  These ruthless social engineers have an iron grip on our educational system and are teaching our children to hate America and that our president is worse than Hitler and needs to be assassinated.
[03:22:45.759 --> 03:22:47.741]  But as America reawakens...
[03:22:48.221 --> 03:22:52.867]  These powerful, deep state, rogue government forces are beginning to panic.
[03:22:53.508 --> 03:23:07.405]  They've even got the former president on television and in the news and traveling to foreign countries, bad-mouthing America, bad-mouthing sovereignty, and calling for resistance to our elected president in a last-ditch effort.
[03:23:08.005 --> 03:23:18.311]  Mainstream media is now legitimizing the use of violence against anyone that opposes the globalist takeover, and against anyone who's actually trying to make this nation great again.
[03:23:18.792 --> 03:23:31.079]  They are absolutely intensifying their efforts, screaming homophobe, xenophobe, racist, to make them march, to make them go out on the streets and assault viciously anyone trying to exercise their free speech.
[03:23:31.599 --> 03:23:39.524]  International criminals like George Soros are openly pushing for civil insurrection in America that will lead to civil war.
[03:23:40.045 --> 03:23:46.869]  The beatings, the stabbings, the shootings, the burning cars, the looting of shops, the execution of police officers.
[03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:57.657]  All of this leads to the destabilization, to the martial law that the deep state and the globalists say they need to bring in their final takeover of America.
[03:23:58.377 --> 03:24:02.678]  We are America, and we are the InfoWars.
[03:24:12.501 --> 03:24:19.104]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:19.544 --> 03:24:23.345]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:24:27.052 --> 03:24:31.234]  I will be hosting the full three hours of the main radio show tomorrow.
[03:24:31.254 --> 03:24:35.995]  We've got Tommy Robinson coming on to talk about the latest with everything that he's doing.
[03:24:36.115 --> 03:24:38.976]  We may have another guest that I'm working on as well.
[03:24:39.016 --> 03:24:39.836]  We'll wait and see on that.
[03:24:39.876 --> 03:24:43.418]  But I will be hosting the full three hours of the radio show tomorrow.
[03:24:44.338 --> 03:24:49.639]  Before I get back into the news today, I want to tell you about the last week of July specials.
[03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:55.761]  This is the last week that you can take advantage of these specials, of course, with the month of July coming to an end.
[03:24:55.781 --> 03:24:59.862]  Huge discounts on a ton of products.

[03:25:02.563 --> 03:25:04.744]  We're always under media attack.
[03:25:05.164 --> 03:25:07.525]  It's intensified over the past few months.
[03:25:07.906 --> 03:25:11.687]  This hysteria they've created around Trump hasn't worked.
[03:25:11.968 --> 03:25:13.908]  So now they're getting more and more desperate.
[03:25:14.149 --> 03:25:18.991]  The attacks are increasing, which is why we need your support more than ever.

[03:25:22.733 --> 03:25:24.273]  That's a ridiculous discount.

[03:26:35.033 --> 03:26:36.775]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:26:39.397 --> 03:26:41.299]  Please support us today.
[03:26:43.220 --> 03:26:55.206]  Now, as Scaramucci, the mooch, begins the clean-out of the leakers, the traitors, that have tried to sabotage Donald J. Trump, Michael Moore is still having a temper tantrum.
[03:26:56.366 --> 03:27:02.810]  The guy who has literally tried to overthrow Trump through his hysteria for the past six, seven months.
[03:27:03.735 --> 03:27:05.777]  He's still talking about it.
[03:27:06.297 --> 03:27:07.558]  This is out of CNS News.
[03:27:07.618 --> 03:27:13.524]  Michael Moore, I refuse to live in a country where Donald Trump is president and I'm not leaving.
[03:27:13.764 --> 03:27:17.307]  Literally sounds like a child having a tantrum because he didn't get his own way.
[03:27:18.128 --> 03:27:19.269]  Actually sounds like that.
[03:27:19.769 --> 03:27:21.150]  Let's go to the video clip.
[03:27:21.170 --> 03:27:24.313]  This is Michael Moore on Stephen Colbert's show.
[03:27:24.353 --> 03:27:25.014]  Here's the clip.
[03:27:25.935 --> 03:27:26.655]  I will tell you this.
[03:27:26.835 --> 03:27:27.476]  I will say this.
[03:27:27.616 --> 03:27:28.157]  I will say this.
[03:27:30.541 --> 03:27:35.528]  I refuse to live in a country where Donald Trump is president, and I'm not leaving.
[03:27:36.189 --> 03:27:38.753]  So, something's gotta change.
[03:27:40.759 --> 03:27:42.040]  Get used to it!
[03:28:10.951 --> 03:28:21.814]  Six months later, or even seven months later, hysterical sack of crap, Michael Moore is still trying to overthrow the President with his temper tantrums.
[03:28:22.154 --> 03:28:26.376]  After all this time, I think what happened with Michael Moore, who by the way,
[03:28:27.509 --> 03:28:47.987]  Was a big Bernie Sanders fan, basically said Hillary Clinton was evil incarnate for months and months during the presidential campaign, suddenly flipped and endorsed Hillary Clinton despite the fact that she was evil according to him for being funded by Goldman Sachs, for voting for the Iraq war, for all these other reasons why you shouldn't vote for her.
[03:28:48.447 --> 03:28:49.828]  Oh, suddenly you should vote for her.
[03:28:50.869 --> 03:28:52.991]  That's Michael Moore's integrity.
[03:28:53.492 --> 03:28:54.572]  It's non-existent.
[03:28:55.373 --> 03:29:00.276]  So this is a guy who came out when everyone was saying, oh, it's inevitable that Hillary Clinton will win.
[03:29:00.896 --> 03:29:07.040]  He's the one guy on the left that said, no, we have to be troubled by the prospect of Donald Trump winning.
[03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:07.741]  He was right.
[03:29:08.301 --> 03:29:15.365]  Basically, since now he thinks he's Nostradamus, that he predicted this great unknown event, he thinks he can actually
[03:29:16.266 --> 03:29:16.567]  Yeah.
[03:29:26.758 --> 03:29:30.220]  Hysterical resistance activity he's tried has failed.
[03:29:30.500 --> 03:29:32.781]  Called on the Democrats to declare a national emergency.
[03:29:33.061 --> 03:29:33.422]  Failed.
[03:29:33.682 --> 03:29:36.123]  Called on protesters to disrupt the inauguration.
[03:29:36.443 --> 03:29:36.803]  Failed.
[03:29:37.904 --> 03:29:43.147]  Said there was something unexpected that might happen in December that would prevent Trump from being inaugurated.
[03:29:43.747 --> 03:29:44.528]  Never happened.
[03:29:45.328 --> 03:29:46.989]  Michael Moore is a sack of crap.
[03:29:47.209 --> 03:29:48.690]  He's been wrong time and time again.
[03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:50.551]  He'll be wrong with this too.
[03:29:50.611 --> 03:29:51.771]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:29:51.791 --> 03:29:52.352]  Don't go away.
[03:29:53.666 --> 03:29:55.287]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.188 --> 03:29:58.991]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:04.035 --> 03:30:12.803]  After speaking with his military staff, President Trump has banned transgenders from the military, citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons.
[03:30:12.923 --> 03:30:19.029]  His decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another.
[03:30:19.189 --> 03:30:25.453]  In other news, President Trump also publicly blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not replacing acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
[03:30:25.493 --> 03:30:30.356]  It was at the center of controversy after his wife received $700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton.
[03:30:30.397 --> 03:30:32.918]  McCabe was handling the FBI investigation into Clinton.
[03:30:32.938 --> 03:30:37.741]  The President also blasted Sessions on Tuesday for taking, quote, a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes.
[03:30:37.862 --> 03:30:43.866]  So far, Sessions has focused more on ramping up civil asset forfeiture and prosecuting marijuana users than investigating Hillary Clinton.
[03:30:43.926 --> 03:30:45.907]  CNN, however, has launched an investigation.
[03:30:46.067 --> 03:30:47.308]  To media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[03:30:47.408 --> 03:30:58.316]  The founder of the Drudge Report has been spending a lot of time at the White House, which has forced establishment media to not only acknowledge his influence over Trump, but also his role as the progress meter of the Trump agenda and how the Drudge Report represents middle America.
[03:30:58.416 --> 03:31:01.558]  If Matt Drudge is concerned about the progress Trump is making, so should the president.
[03:31:01.578 --> 03:31:03.620]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com
[03:31:03.940 --> 03:31:05.361]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:31:55.659 --> 03:31:57.980]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[03:31:58.000 --> 03:31:59.640]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:59.660 --> 03:32:01.161]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:32:20.828 --> 03:32:24.271]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[03:32:24.611 --> 03:32:26.352]  The left controls culture.
[03:32:26.392 --> 03:32:27.373]  They control arts.
[03:32:27.433 --> 03:32:28.654]  They control entertainment.
[03:32:28.954 --> 03:32:36.039]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:32:36.099 --> 03:32:38.501]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[03:32:38.981 --> 03:32:42.844]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[03:32:42.904 --> 03:32:44.966]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[03:32:45.586 --> 03:32:50.970]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[03:32:51.230 --> 03:32:57.475]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[03:32:57.555 --> 03:32:59.237]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[03:32:59.397 --> 03:33:00.578]  It's available right now.
[03:33:00.898 --> 03:33:03.080]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:07.688 --> 03:33:09.912]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[03:33:09.972 --> 03:33:15.681]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.282 --> 03:33:20.008]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:23.397 --> 03:33:23.917]  We are back!
[03:33:24.218 --> 03:33:26.179]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.199 --> 03:33:34.103]  There was just an article published at a website called Pop Matters, entitled, The Summer of Love Lives On at the High Sierra Music Festival.
[03:33:34.444 --> 03:33:39.907]  They mention my phrase, which I've said many times over the past six months at Conservatism.
[03:33:40.487 --> 03:33:47.629]  Here's the new counterculture, which is completely borne out by the fact that Generation Z is the most conservative generation since World War II.
[03:33:48.029 --> 03:33:54.890]  More and more people are rejecting the alt-left, which has essentially become the mainstream left over the past year or so.
[03:33:55.430 --> 03:33:57.031]  Oh, but this article proves me wrong.
[03:33:57.091 --> 03:34:03.572]  It says, quote, this key point about peace, love and fun, because leftists really love fun, don't they?
[03:34:03.592 --> 03:34:08.613]  They don't try to ban anyone who says anything offensive, is what alt-right agitator
[03:34:09.073 --> 03:34:10.514]  Don't even identify as alt-right.
[03:34:11.194 --> 03:34:19.637]  Paul Joseph Watson from Infowars.com misses completely with his utterly clueless suggestion earlier this year that the alt... This is a quote from them.
[03:34:20.337 --> 03:34:23.238]  I said apparently, quote, the alt-right is the new counterculture.
[03:34:23.538 --> 03:34:24.259]  That's a quote.
[03:34:24.739 --> 03:34:25.539]  Never said that.
[03:34:26.159 --> 03:34:26.980]  Never said that.
[03:34:27.580 --> 03:34:32.642]  Like, learn how... Learn what quotes are before trying slagging me off in articles.
[03:34:33.362 --> 03:34:36.185]  I said conservatism was the new cancer culture, not the alt-right.
[03:34:36.326 --> 03:34:37.727]  The alt-right doesn't even like me.
[03:34:37.988 --> 03:34:38.588]  Get it right.
[03:34:38.648 --> 03:34:40.030]  This is basic stuff here.
[03:34:41.051 --> 03:34:42.613]  No, sir, Mr. Watson.
[03:34:42.653 --> 03:34:45.476]  This article reads like it was written by a 14-year-old.
[03:34:45.837 --> 03:34:47.298]  No, sir, Mr. Watson.
[03:34:47.419 --> 03:34:50.062]  You and your ilk aren't even in the ballpark.
[03:34:52.136 --> 03:35:11.264]  Right, so me saying conservatism is the new counterculture was so silly, was so asinine, was so manifestly ridiculous four months ago, that the left spent the next four months writing panicked articles reassuring themselves that conservatism isn't the new counterculture.
[03:35:11.464 --> 03:35:17.447]  If what I said was so out there, so incredibly stupid, why do you keep bringing it up?
[03:35:18.450 --> 03:35:29.737]  Something tells me it makes them nervous because they're looking at the same polls as me that show, as I said, Generation Z being the most conservative generation since World War II.
[03:35:30.137 --> 03:35:31.478]  They're looking at the same numbers.
[03:35:31.838 --> 03:35:32.579]  They're panicked.
[03:35:32.919 --> 03:35:33.699]  They're nervous.
[03:35:34.040 --> 03:35:39.343]  They're having to reassure themselves that they have the monopoly on the counterculture.
[03:35:39.603 --> 03:35:40.184]  And they did.
[03:35:41.127 --> 03:35:42.708]  They have, for so long.
[03:35:42.988 --> 03:35:45.390]  That's how they became the dominant culture.
[03:35:46.110 --> 03:35:49.273]  You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture.
[03:35:49.573 --> 03:35:50.974]  When are you gonna get that?
[03:35:52.475 --> 03:35:59.700]  When all the celebrities on the left virtue signal, they all share the same opinions, that's not counterculture anymore.
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:02.182]  It's a pretty simple concept to understand.
[03:36:03.208 --> 03:36:11.181]  And they, in the back of their minds, I think they really do understand it, which is why they're so nervous, which is why they have to write these panicked articles.
[03:36:12.063 --> 03:36:16.089]  The past four months since I said that, I don't even say it that much on Twitter anymore.
[03:36:16.997 --> 03:36:18.138]  They bring it up!
[03:36:18.818 --> 03:36:21.160]  This really... I'm going to start saying it more.
[03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:24.022]  I'm going to start saying it every day once again.
[03:36:24.383 --> 03:36:29.326]  Conservatism is the new counterculture because this really gets under their skin.
[03:36:29.747 --> 03:36:32.629]  I'm going to resurrect it and it's going to come back stronger than ever.
[03:36:32.869 --> 03:36:34.470]  How do you like them apples?
[03:36:35.231 --> 03:36:36.992]  Absolutely hilarious stuff.
[03:36:37.593 --> 03:36:38.713]  Speaking of hilarious,
[03:36:39.707 --> 03:36:45.088]  The BBC came out with a cartoon, and this was actually in a December 2016 production.
[03:36:45.408 --> 03:36:49.589]  It was an educational cartoon for kids about Roman Britain.
[03:36:50.590 --> 03:36:58.351]  They chose to depict a quote, typical, their word, not mine, typical Roman family in Britain 1,500 years ago as black.
[03:37:01.889 --> 03:37:03.030]  Now, why do you think they did that?
[03:37:03.050 --> 03:37:21.042]  Do you think they did that because a typical Roman family in Roman Britain 1,500 years ago would have been black, or because it was politically correct tokenism from the BBC, one of the most, if not the most, PC-obsessed entities in the Western world?
[03:37:21.342 --> 03:37:23.103]  Which one do you think is more likely?
[03:37:23.443 --> 03:37:24.744]  Well, I made a video about this.
[03:37:24.824 --> 03:37:25.685]  In fact, the original
[03:37:26.638 --> 03:37:28.419]  Way the issue arose was a tweet.
[03:37:28.740 --> 03:37:32.703]  I got attacked by some fake supply teacher who claimed to be a historian.
[03:37:33.043 --> 03:37:34.124]  The media picked it up.
[03:37:34.604 --> 03:37:35.145]  J.K.
[03:37:35.205 --> 03:37:36.325]  Rowling picked it up.
[03:37:36.786 --> 03:37:41.590]  It got a lot of press attention from outlets that nobody reads, basically.
[03:37:42.330 --> 03:37:43.691]  So it turned into a bit of a thing.
[03:37:43.731 --> 03:37:44.812]  I made a video about it.
[03:37:45.132 --> 03:37:45.832]  This is the video.
[03:37:45.912 --> 03:37:50.935]  I'm going to come back and talk about it after because this has only got funnier in the two days since.
[03:37:51.476 --> 03:38:05.044]  Here's the video about the BBC and historians self-proclaimed literally trying to rewrite history to claim that Roman Britain was ethnically diverse 1,500 years ago.
[03:38:05.124 --> 03:38:05.745]  Here's the video.
[03:38:06.485 --> 03:38:18.031]  The BBC released an educational documentary about Roman Britain depicting what they said was, quote, an exploration of life in Roman Britain shown through the eyes of a typical family.
[03:38:18.071 --> 03:38:23.073]  This is how they chose to depict a typical family in Roman Britain over 1,500 years ago.
[03:38:23.093 --> 03:38:23.213]  Yeah.
[03:38:24.734 --> 03:38:25.094]  Really?
[03:38:25.274 --> 03:38:41.700]  I tweeted about it saying it was historically inaccurate to depict Rome and Britain as ethnically diverse, making the point that this was obviously the BBC engaging in politically correct tokenism, and that this wasn't what a typical family in Rome and Britain would have looked like.
[03:38:41.920 --> 03:38:43.981]  Oh, and the butthurt was immense!
[03:38:44.141 --> 03:38:50.082]  Verified libtards from every corner of Twitter exploded with rage, including J.K.
[03:38:50.122 --> 03:39:02.926]  Rowling, who still hasn't got back to me on why she virtue signals all day about refugees, yet still hasn't taken in any refugees, despite owning multiple mansions and having umpteen empty spare bedrooms.
[03:39:03.026 --> 03:39:08.307]  She then retweeted this tweetstorm from a self-proclaimed historian supply teacher.
[03:39:08.487 --> 03:39:10.648]  Let's call him Mr. Potato Head.
[03:39:10.708 --> 03:39:16.731]  Who proceeded to school me on how Roman Britain really was ethnically diverse.
[03:39:16.892 --> 03:39:19.133]  Except, he didn't school me on anything.
[03:39:19.473 --> 03:39:22.535]  He schooled himself on being a retard.
[03:39:22.575 --> 03:39:27.258]  What was Mr. Potato Head's evidence that Roman Britain was ethnically diverse?
[03:39:27.298 --> 03:39:32.120]  Well, first that I'm a fascist, which, last time I checked, isn't an argument.
[03:39:32.240 --> 03:39:35.722]  Second, that provincial governors in Roman Britain had black slaves.
[03:39:35.882 --> 03:39:40.105]  And third, that they found the skeleton of a North African woman who lived in Roman London.
[03:39:40.525 --> 03:39:41.606]  And that's it.
[03:39:41.626 --> 03:39:49.273]  So Mr. Potato Head schooling me consisted of him proving there were a smattering of non-white people living in Roman Britain.
[03:39:49.313 --> 03:39:53.897]  Which is not the same thing as proving that Roman Britain was ethnically diverse.
[03:39:54.157 --> 03:39:54.718]  It wasn't.
[03:39:55.078 --> 03:39:59.482]  And this isn't a typical depiction of a family in Roman Britain.
[03:39:59.622 --> 03:40:11.005]  There is some evidence of migration to Roman Britain from other parts of the Empire, but there is considerable evidence to suggest that the population of Roman Britain remained overwhelmingly indigenous.
[03:40:11.285 --> 03:40:18.707]  Including the army's dependents, there were probably 125,000 migrants in the British Isles out of a population of 4 million, which is about 3%.
[03:40:19.767 --> 03:40:30.923]  It would be as ludicrous as going to a country that's 97% black and then claiming that this is an accurate representation of a typical family living in that country.
[03:40:31.123 --> 03:40:34.248]  A small amount of non-white people living in a country.
[03:40:34.909 --> 03:40:36.470]  Doesn't make it ethnically diverse.
[03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:42.456]  That's clearly an outlier, not a reflection of widespread ethnic diversity.
[03:40:42.496 --> 03:40:50.443]  That's like saying Japan is ethnically diverse because 1.5% of people living in Japan aren't ethnically Japanese.
[03:40:50.543 --> 03:40:51.644]  Japan is 98.5% Japanese.
[03:40:54.406 --> 03:40:56.307]  That's not ethnically diverse!
[03:40:56.427 --> 03:41:03.872]  When I asked Mr. Potato Head directly what percentage of Roman Britons were non-white, he admitted there was no way of knowing.
[03:41:03.932 --> 03:41:06.614]  But that Roman Britain definitely wasn't homogenous.
[03:41:06.774 --> 03:41:09.176]  Except, I never said it was homogenous.
[03:41:09.356 --> 03:41:11.797]  I also never said it was monoracial.
[03:41:11.877 --> 03:41:12.898]  Yeah, little tip!
[03:41:13.358 --> 03:41:19.446]  If you school me on an argument that I never made, that's not schooling me.
[03:41:19.466 --> 03:41:23.691]  That's called a straw man and a complete misrepresentation of my argument.
[03:41:23.731 --> 03:41:26.514]  You called me a retard, yet you can't read.
[03:41:27.075 --> 03:41:27.896]  Who's the retard?
[03:41:27.956 --> 03:41:33.122]  No one is denying that there were a small amount of non-white people in Roman Britain.
[03:41:33.542 --> 03:41:34.863]  That's not the argument.
[03:41:34.943 --> 03:41:43.787]  The fact that there were a smattering of non-white people in Rome and Britain doesn't mean that Rome and Britain was ethnically diverse by today's standards.
[03:41:43.927 --> 03:41:48.629]  To the point where a typical family in Rome and Britain would be depicted as black.
[03:41:48.809 --> 03:41:51.651]  Let's look at some other depictions of Roman Britain.
[03:41:51.711 --> 03:42:00.097]  So given that this is how the BBC thinks Roman Britain should accurately be depicted, what kind of racist would depict Roman Britain like this?
[03:42:00.317 --> 03:42:01.858]  No black people in that image.
[03:42:02.078 --> 03:42:03.680]  Oh look, it's the BBC!
[03:42:04.480 --> 03:42:09.402]  This is how the BBC chose to depict Roman Britain back in 2003.
[03:42:09.942 --> 03:42:14.504]  Back then, everyone in the BBC's depiction of Roman Britain was white.
[03:42:14.764 --> 03:42:18.905]  Right, so what's changed between 2003 and 2017?
[03:42:19.626 --> 03:42:26.448]  Did we suddenly reverse 2,000 years of knowledge and figure out that Roman Britain was in fact ethnically diverse?
[03:42:26.628 --> 03:42:31.290]  Or did the BBC, which is so politically correct when it comes to race,
[03:42:31.570 --> 03:42:34.773]  That it literally banned white people from applying for jobs.
[03:42:34.873 --> 03:42:40.237]  During that time period, become obsessed with political correctness and racial tokenism.
[03:42:40.297 --> 03:42:42.579]  Which is the more likely scenario?
[03:42:42.779 --> 03:42:44.601]  Hmm, I wonder.
[03:42:44.701 --> 03:42:46.663]  Here's another depiction of Roman Britain.
[03:42:46.743 --> 03:42:49.145]  Queen Boudicca leading a rebellion against the Romans.
[03:42:49.565 --> 03:42:51.266]  Yeah, a lot of honkies in that painting.
[03:42:51.286 --> 03:42:53.187]  Here's another depiction of Roman Britain.
[03:42:53.227 --> 03:42:56.989]  A famous painting called Britain's Deploring Departure of the Last Roman Legion.
[03:42:57.269 --> 03:42:58.830]  Yeah, I don't see many black people.
[03:42:58.870 --> 03:43:03.072]  Here's the Natural History Museum's illustration of daily life in Roman London.
[03:43:03.312 --> 03:43:05.754]  You'll notice a distinct lack of melanin.
[03:43:05.794 --> 03:43:10.276]  Here's another famous painting of a family of ancient Britons in Roman Britain.
[03:43:10.616 --> 03:43:11.897]  Yeah, a lot of whiteys there.
[03:43:12.337 --> 03:43:12.977]  Here's another.
[03:43:13.157 --> 03:43:17.860]  Is this a more accurate depiction of a typical family in Roman Britain?
[03:43:18.220 --> 03:43:18.860]  Or is this?
[03:43:19.080 --> 03:43:39.186]  So either Roman Britain wasn't ethnically diverse by today's standards, and all these depictions of Roman Britain stretching back hundreds of years are consistently accurate in depicting that, or every single one of these depictions is wrong, and this one BBC depiction from 2017 is accurate.
[03:43:39.207 --> 03:43:41.047]  Which is the more likely scenario?
[03:43:41.107 --> 03:43:46.689]  To portray a typical family, again their words not mine, in Roman Britain as black,
[03:43:47.529 --> 03:43:48.470]  Is not typical.
[03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:50.110]  It would be incredibly rare.
[03:43:50.171 --> 03:43:54.613]  Which is why virtually every other depiction of Roman Britain doesn't do this.
[03:43:54.733 --> 03:44:00.436]  The BBC did it for politically correct tokenism at the expense of historical accuracy.
[03:44:00.496 --> 03:44:03.178]  That's the argument I made and it's patently true.
[03:44:03.298 --> 03:44:05.519]  This is an ethnically diverse Britain.
[03:44:05.979 --> 03:44:06.600]  This isn't!
[03:44:06.740 --> 03:44:11.064]  Rome and Britain clearly wasn't ethnically diverse by today's standards.
[03:44:11.204 --> 03:44:17.169]  Here's the BBC's next educational cartoon, an insight into how British women lived during the Victorian era.
[03:44:17.209 --> 03:44:19.692]  Historians say it's stunningly accurate.
[03:44:19.732 --> 03:44:25.337]  Tomorrow on BBC One, we look at how Vikings invaded and occupied England from the 8th century onwards.
[03:44:25.637 --> 03:44:26.738]  Stunningly accurate!
[03:44:26.758 --> 03:44:28.240]  Oh yeah, and just like flies around ****.
[03:44:28.880 --> 03:44:32.902]  The usual gaggle of UK leftist hipster twats descended on this.
[03:44:33.062 --> 03:44:40.565]  Mashable, The Independent, who by the way write endless hit pieces on me while begging for an interview, and Elle Magazine.
[03:44:40.625 --> 03:44:44.767]  This history buffs takedown of a political correctness gone mad tweet is everything we needed today!
[03:44:44.787 --> 03:44:46.748]  A black James Bond, that's political correctness gone mad.
[03:44:46.828 --> 03:44:49.069]  A cartoon Rastafarian mouse, that's political correctness gone mad.
[03:44:49.189 --> 03:44:49.349]  Yeah.
[03:44:49.469 --> 03:45:01.932]  Can you enlighten me please, Elle Magazine, on how people getting mad over fictional TV and movie characters, which I said nothing about, has anything to do with a debate about historical accuracy?
[03:45:02.032 --> 03:45:04.353]  Oh, but Mr. Potato Head owned me.
[03:45:04.373 --> 03:45:10.434]  How are you going to own me when you can't even own the fact that your hairline has itself receded back to Roman times?
[03:45:12.113 --> 03:45:13.154]  Just shave it off.
[03:45:13.174 --> 03:45:16.076]  Yeah, and wearing cats on your head isn't a long-term solution.
[03:45:16.096 --> 03:45:16.757]  PJW got triggered.
[03:45:16.797 --> 03:45:17.697]  Look how triggered he is.
[03:45:17.778 --> 03:45:18.298]  Untriggered.
[03:45:18.318 --> 03:45:22.922]  Yeah, this guy's so PC obsessed, he gets triggered by images of Templar Knights.
[03:45:23.082 --> 03:45:27.225]  He posted a long diatribe, f***ing his pants, about me making this video.
[03:45:27.265 --> 03:45:36.613]  So you attack me publicly, get all your verified libtard friends to pile in, and then when I dare to respond, you go cry in a corner.
[03:45:37.830 --> 03:45:39.611]  They love to dish it out, don't they?
[03:45:39.771 --> 03:45:41.673]  Not so good at taking it back, though.
[03:45:41.773 --> 03:45:52.500]  I mean, do I even need to roast this guy, considering he got roasted by his own politically correct obsessed fanbase for using an offensive word and had to apologize for it?
[03:45:52.580 --> 03:46:00.345]  This is a guy who was in the news for trying to ban the word banter in school classrooms because someone's feelings might get hurt.
[03:46:00.466 --> 03:46:00.966]  Banter?
[03:46:01.206 --> 03:46:01.546]  Untriggered.
[03:46:18.916 --> 03:46:25.861]  Roman Britain was clearly a clumsy attempt to inject politically correct propaganda into a cartoon aimed at children.
[03:46:25.961 --> 03:46:29.263]  It wasn't historically accurate by today's standards.
[03:46:29.484 --> 03:46:32.125]  Roman Britain wasn't ethnically diverse.
[03:46:32.165 --> 03:46:33.887]  You didn't school me on anything.
[03:46:33.907 --> 03:46:35.688]  You didn't even address my argument.
[03:46:35.768 --> 03:46:42.753]  You're a self-proclaimed historian who's literally trying to rewrite history to fit your political agenda.
[03:46:42.833 --> 03:46:46.335]  The lie that Britain has always been ethnically diverse.
[03:46:46.555 --> 03:46:47.156]  It hasn't.
[03:46:47.296 --> 03:46:53.440]  You're trying to posh the myth that mass uncontrolled immigration is natural because it's always been that way.
[03:46:53.520 --> 03:47:04.587]  Immigration into Britain was minimal until the 20th century and no amount of PC pandering BBC cartoons for kids are ever going to change that historical fact.
[03:47:04.727 --> 03:47:09.690]  Mr Potato Head, you tried to take on the king of the roast and look what happened.
[03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:10.831]  You got
[03:47:15.518 --> 03:47:19.302]  There we have it, that is the video called Paul Joseph Watson got owned!
[03:47:19.882 --> 03:47:22.805]  Tongue-in-cheek title, and this continues today.
[03:47:23.206 --> 03:47:31.434]  They actually came out with an article in The Independent, which by the way, as I said in the video, literally begged me for an interview over and over again.
[03:47:31.454 --> 03:47:36.099]  I said no, so they proceeded to write hit piece after hit piece, which is okay because
[03:47:36.618 --> 03:47:37.479]  Nobody reads them!
[03:47:38.079 --> 03:47:45.745]  In fact, this article, when I looked at it earlier today, hours after it had been published, it had one comment.
[03:47:46.545 --> 03:47:47.706]  That comment was by me.
[03:47:48.867 --> 03:47:51.109]  So nobody's even reading this stuff!
[03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:55.972]  The fact is, some of it does get amplified, though, when people like J.K.
[03:47:56.032 --> 03:47:56.432]  Rowling
[03:47:57.333 --> 03:47:58.594]  Virtue Signaler Supreme.
[03:47:58.874 --> 03:47:59.675]  Retweet it.
[03:47:59.735 --> 03:48:01.756]  She's got millions of idiotic followers.
[03:48:02.077 --> 03:48:03.698]  Twitter is a big echo chamber.
[03:48:03.998 --> 03:48:05.259]  It gets media attention.
[03:48:05.759 --> 03:48:06.680]  I respond to it.
[03:48:07.181 --> 03:48:08.001]  Oh, you're triggered!
[03:48:08.602 --> 03:48:19.210]  Now, there's a difference between being triggered, for example, by an image of Nigel Farage, as the left is, or an image of a Templar Knight, like this potato head fake historian was.
[03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:24.814]  There's a difference between that and responding to attacks on you by the media, OK?
[03:48:25.094 --> 03:48:25.915]  Big difference.
[03:48:26.295 --> 03:48:27.356]  Get your own insult.
[03:48:27.436 --> 03:48:36.443]  Isn't it amazing that the word triggered has been appropriated by the left because they're so intellectually stunted to think up their own insult?
[03:48:37.003 --> 03:48:38.204]  Interesting development there.
[03:48:38.584 --> 03:48:42.187]  But this article out of The Independent, if you want to pull it up, the headline is this.
[03:48:44.662 --> 03:48:49.704]  While debunking a historian, this alt-right commentator got owned again!
[03:48:49.724 --> 03:48:53.625]  So if we just put owned in the headline, that means he was owned.
[03:48:53.965 --> 03:48:54.965]  Okay, let's take a look.
[03:48:55.985 --> 03:49:11.570]  The article says at the tail end of the rambling monologue, they're talking about the video that you just heard, Watson suggests sequels to the BBC educational video, including an insight into how British women lived during the Victorian era while displaying a picture of women wearing burqas and hijabs.
[03:49:12.050 --> 03:49:13.611]  And if you scroll down this article,
[03:49:14.531 --> 03:49:19.252]  Click on the article there, click on the link to the independent article.
[03:49:19.292 --> 03:49:20.852]  You can scroll down in the article.
[03:49:21.192 --> 03:49:27.134]  They show my original tweet where I make a joke saying, what's the BBC going to do next?
[03:49:27.234 --> 03:49:37.496]  Are they going to say that this, pictures of Muslim women in hijabs, are representative, if you scroll down further, of 19, there you have it right there, there's a tweet.
[03:49:37.796 --> 03:49:41.877]  Is that representative of 19th century Victorian era women?
[03:49:41.957 --> 03:49:43.437]  Is that what they're going to say next?
[03:49:43.837 --> 03:49:45.159]  Is it going to get that crazy?
[03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:59.820]  And they came out in this article and said that I was owned because one person on Twitter pointed out that a mosque was built in 1889 in the UK in London, which is what?
[03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:14.727]  Literally two years before Queen Victoria died, and that because there was one mosque in London, that that means pictures of women in burqas is an accurate representation of Victorian era Britain.
[03:50:15.087 --> 03:50:21.250]  They actually made that point and said that I was owned for saying that that's ridiculous.
[03:50:22.350 --> 03:50:23.751]  I got owned for saying
[03:50:24.671 --> 03:50:31.567]  Showing pictures of Muslim women in burqas and claiming that that's representative of Victorian-era England.
[03:50:32.510 --> 03:50:34.113]  I got owned for saying that as a joke.
[03:50:34.827 --> 03:50:42.211]  Absolutely incredible, because one mosque existed in London two years before Queen Victoria died.
[03:50:42.671 --> 03:50:48.134]  Therefore, London and England must have just been awash with burqa-wearing Muslim women, right?
[03:50:49.034 --> 03:50:52.856]  That's literally what they put, and people get paid to publish this.
[03:50:53.456 --> 03:50:56.117]  No wonder that absolutely no one reads The Independent.
[03:50:56.157 --> 03:50:59.299]  That's why it went out of business in the print version in the first place.
[03:50:59.359 --> 03:51:02.340]  We'll be back on The Alex Jones Show, live after the break, InfoWars.com.
[03:51:12.547 --> 03:51:13.413]  We need funding.
[03:51:13.473 --> 03:51:14.541]  The enemy's after us.
[03:51:14.622 --> 03:51:15.267]  We got grapefruit.
[03:51:16.334 --> 03:51:23.259]  Gee, to find ourselves, I sell really great products at very affordable prices, so you like them, and you use them, and you want to order them more.
[03:51:23.279 --> 03:51:28.363]  I don't think like a globalist I treat you how I want to be treated, and you treat me like that, and I love you.
[03:51:28.403 --> 03:51:29.004]  You're awesome.
[03:51:29.324 --> 03:51:39.952]  It is such a pleasure that they want to destroy us, and they can't because you support us, and you pray for us, and you spread the articles, and you buy the products, and you just absolutely are committed.
[03:51:40.953 --> 03:51:41.653]  Oh, you're awesome.
[03:51:41.734 --> 03:51:45.937]  It's just unbelievable how we rub at their faces and how our will's stronger than theirs.
[03:51:50.928 --> 03:51:58.982]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had to end the super male vitality, super female vitality of the X2 and the Rainforce because...
[03:52:00.461 --> 03:52:05.563]  They're selling out, and I don't like to just do discounts so good that we're sold out for a month or two before more comes in.
[03:52:05.743 --> 03:52:06.704]  There's a limited supply left.

[03:52:51.384 --> 03:52:54.146]  ProPure Traveler, 30% off, $132.
[03:52:54.186 --> 03:52:59.988]  Blows away all the other major gravity-fed filters that sell the same type of unit that didn't as good for $225.
[03:53:01.289 --> 03:53:03.250]  ProPure is amazing.
[03:53:03.770 --> 03:53:05.431]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:53:05.811 --> 03:53:07.832]  Alexa Pure Breeze, amazing.
[03:53:08.192 --> 03:53:10.494]  Air filtration system, comparable units for $400.
[03:53:10.554 --> 03:53:12.174]  They were like $1,000 a few years ago.
[03:53:12.194 --> 03:53:12.915]  They're all getting cheaper.
[03:53:13.175 --> 03:53:14.556]  There's a miniaturization of technology.
[03:53:15.576 --> 03:53:16.577]  $200 is a great deal.
[03:53:16.597 --> 03:53:19.699]  $149.96, 25% off retail.
[03:53:20.179 --> 03:53:21.460]  Usually we discount to $189.
[03:53:21.800 --> 03:53:24.422]  That is a devastating price right there.
[03:53:24.502 --> 03:53:25.202]  Amazing.

[03:53:51.276 --> 03:53:52.296]  Savage the enemy!

[03:53:53.316 --> 03:53:54.317]  Break their spirit!
[03:53:54.497 --> 03:53:55.317]  Never give up!

[03:53:58.818 --> 03:53:59.218]  Yes!
[03:54:09.449 --> 03:54:16.012]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.492 --> 03:54:20.234]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:54:23.775 --> 03:54:25.817]  Be sure to tune in to the show tomorrow.
[03:54:25.837 --> 03:54:29.139]  I'll be hosting three hours of Friday show.
[03:54:29.219 --> 03:54:33.923]  Guests include Tommy Robinson and maybe one other, so be sure to tune in for that.
[03:54:34.723 --> 03:54:42.029]  I'm going to hit a couple of final news stories here in a second, but I want to tell you about free shipping storewide at infowarsstore.com.
[03:54:42.109 --> 03:54:43.030]  Still available.
[03:54:43.370 --> 03:54:46.352]  Free shipping on absolutely everything.
[03:54:46.872 --> 03:54:50.855]  Which, if you think about it, if you're stocking up, if you're buying a lot of products at once,
[03:54:51.809 --> 03:54:53.509]  Free shipping on every single product.
[03:54:53.530 --> 03:55:01.452]  That is going to save you a ton of money and it's still available on all supplements, water filters, gear, seeds, DVDs and books.
[03:55:01.772 --> 03:55:05.033]  Help support the operation and get the best high quality products out there.
[03:55:05.533 --> 03:55:06.993]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:55:07.373 --> 03:55:08.534]  Free shipping.
[03:55:08.574 --> 03:55:12.715]  We also have, as I mentioned before, last week of July specials.
[03:55:12.815 --> 03:55:17.996]  These specials are all going to end and that is a big deal because on some of these products you can get 66% off
[03:55:20.097 --> 03:55:21.879]  For example, the Silver Bullet is just £9.95.
[03:55:23.001 --> 03:55:24.163]  That's a massive discount.
[03:55:24.583 --> 03:55:26.205]  Last week of July specials.
[03:55:26.926 --> 03:55:28.048]  Again, we're not funded.
[03:55:28.689 --> 03:55:34.897]  We don't have to make propaganda pieces for Gulf state dictatorships like CNN to make our money!
[03:55:36.263 --> 03:55:37.444]  Isn't that a good thing?
[03:55:37.564 --> 03:55:41.625]  We're not beholden to the whims of Gulf state dictators.
[03:55:41.665 --> 03:55:47.168]  That's quite a benefit when you're crafting an editorial news agenda, isn't it?
[03:55:47.368 --> 03:55:49.949]  We're beholden to you and nobody else.
[03:55:50.509 --> 03:55:57.713]  You don't get fat checks from George Soros like Black Lives Matter and Media Matters to talk trash about other people, which is all they do.
[03:55:58.593 --> 03:56:00.175]  Not a real news organisation.
[03:56:00.836 --> 03:56:01.757]  We're not funded by that.
[03:56:01.798 --> 03:56:07.305]  We're not funded by giant pharmaceutical companies that tell us what we can and can't publish.
[03:56:08.373 --> 03:56:11.374]  Which, by the way, even some in the alternative media are funded by.

[03:57:15.996 --> 03:57:18.479]  Great Ormond Street Hospital denied as our final wish.
[03:57:18.519 --> 03:57:23.244]  Charlie Godd's parents say, this has been a relentless disgrace from start to finish.
[03:57:23.645 --> 03:57:26.488]  I knew it would happen because this is how they operate.
[03:57:26.508 --> 03:57:28.610]  This is a death panel system.
[03:57:29.051 --> 03:57:35.018]  Remember, I tried to get some media attention for a little Romanian baby that was in the same hospital.
[03:57:35.538 --> 03:57:38.682]  Parents, hard-working immigrants, spoke excellent English.
[03:57:39.223 --> 03:57:44.489]  They were refused permission to have their baby treated elsewhere despite raising the money to do so.
[03:57:44.730 --> 03:57:54.061]  They were refused, in some cases and at certain times, even permission to be with their baby in the hospital alone because these staff
[03:57:54.662 --> 03:57:58.744]  ...were so full of hatred and distrust, they thought they would try and steal their own baby.
[03:57:58.764 --> 03:58:01.685]  Like, rip the cords out and take it out of the hospital.
[03:58:02.185 --> 03:58:03.266]  Absolutely insane.
[03:58:03.866 --> 03:58:06.107]  They weren't given permission to take the baby home.
[03:58:06.167 --> 03:58:07.147]  It died on the roof.
[03:58:07.207 --> 03:58:10.209]  They granted them the permission to take it up to the roof.
[03:58:10.809 --> 03:58:12.610]  Now they're saying in the case of Charlie Gardell...
[03:58:13.530 --> 03:58:14.711]  Let it go to a hospice.
[03:58:14.751 --> 03:58:17.192]  The parents have been denied their final wish.
[03:58:17.432 --> 03:58:19.113]  An absolute disgrace.
[03:58:19.653 --> 03:58:23.895]  Australian police seek the right to install malware on home devices during emergencies.
[03:58:24.296 --> 03:58:31.119]  They're saying during times of national emergency, they need malware in homes to conduct mass surveillance.
[03:58:31.459 --> 03:58:33.080]  Absolutely insane story.
[03:58:33.100 --> 03:58:36.422]  We'll get into that more on tomorrow's show, which I will be hosting.
[03:58:36.462 --> 03:58:37.882]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour.
[03:58:38.163 --> 03:58:39.003]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:58:39.043 --> 03:58:40.804]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:45.786 --> 03:58:49.590]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.734 --> 03:59:02.502]  After speaking with his military staff, President Trump has banned transgenders from the military, citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons.
[03:59:02.622 --> 03:59:08.728]  His decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another.
[03:59:08.848 --> 03:59:15.152]  In other news, President Trump also publicly blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not replacing acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
[03:59:15.192 --> 03:59:20.075]  It was at the center of controversy after his wife received $700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton.
[03:59:20.095 --> 03:59:22.617]  McCabe was handling the FBI investigation into Clinton.
[03:59:22.637 --> 03:59:27.400]  The President also blasted Sessions on Tuesday for taking, quote, a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes.
[03:59:27.560 --> 03:59:33.802]  So far, Sessions has focused more on ramping up civil asset forfeiture and prosecuting marijuana users and investigating Hillary Clinton.
[03:59:33.822 --> 03:59:37.023]  CNN, however, has launched an investigation into media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[03:59:37.123 --> 03:59:48.007]  The founder of the Drudge Report has been spending a lot of time at the White House, which has forced establishment media to not only acknowledge his influence over Trump, but also his role as the progress meter of the Trump agenda and how the Drudge Report represents middle America.
[03:59:48.107 --> 03:59:51.268]  If Matt Drudge is concerned about the progress Trump is making, so should the president.
[03:59:51.288 --> 03:59:53.309]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[03:59:55.908 --> 03:59:59.770]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
