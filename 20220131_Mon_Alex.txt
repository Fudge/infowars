[00:00.000 --> 00:19.480]  You are listening to an infowars.com front line report, if you are receiving this transmission,
[00:19.480 --> 00:39.700]  you are the resistance. Well, I have lived in my 48 years to see quite a lot, my friends.
[00:39.700 --> 00:48.640]  And we are just in such incredibly epic insane times. There's a video that's five hours
[00:48.640 --> 00:57.040]  long that we put together that's on Bandod video with all of the highlights of the multi-day
[00:57.040 --> 01:07.200]  conference put on by US Senator Ron Johnson. And watching the five hours of it went by
[01:07.200 --> 01:12.920]  like ten minutes, it was so horrifying and so documented because I've already researched
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.000]  all this up one side and down the other, so I know how real it is. And it was freaking
[01:18.000 --> 01:28.960]  me out because I'd forgotten 95% of it. I mean, we are being devastated. And you know
[01:28.960 --> 01:32.360]  when you're a little kid and you fall down and bust your head and your dad says, get
[01:32.360 --> 01:38.880]  up, be tough, don't cry, that's a good thing to learn to be tough. But with the globalists,
[01:38.880 --> 01:44.100]  they know that we adapt to being abused and just live with it. And then they just slowly
[01:44.100 --> 01:49.200]  turn up the heat till we're all dead. We cannot just tough it out and take the shots and get
[01:49.200 --> 01:58.200]  sick and die and suck it up. No. Fauci needs to suck it up after he's been convicted for
[01:58.200 --> 02:09.040]  crimes against humanity in a supermax prison. So I'm going to play some of the most important
[02:09.040 --> 02:17.000]  excerpts of this coming up at the bottom of the second hour today. And then investigative
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.080]  journalist Lee Stranahan, who's really been the expert, the best well-spoken person, most
[02:24.080 --> 02:31.760]  accurate I've seen in the eight or nine years I've been interviewing him, harping on Ukraine
[02:31.760 --> 02:37.280]  and Russiagate and basically everything else. And boy, has he been proven to be dead on.
[02:37.280 --> 02:42.800]  So he's going to be joining us in the third hour today. I also intend at the bottom of
[02:42.800 --> 02:49.760]  this hour to open the phones up and take your calls on any subject you wish to discuss.
[02:49.760 --> 02:56.680]  Also I don't just try to cover things because they're interesting or because it'll get
[02:56.680 --> 03:04.080]  people to visit infowars.com and listen to the syndicated censored show. Just getting
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.200]  an audience is not my main goal. Getting a big audience to know what's really going
[03:08.200 --> 03:16.640]  on to take action and stop the new world order is my goal. And so, you know, I do know basically
[03:16.640 --> 03:25.400]  a lot of the inside baseball on Joe Rogan stuff. And it's very exciting stuff. But at
[03:25.400 --> 03:31.160]  one point I don't want to give our enemies any ideas of what's going on. And at the same
[03:31.160 --> 03:38.560]  time Joe didn't tell me this stuff in confidence, but I think it basically is in confidence.
[03:38.560 --> 03:46.840]  So I'm not going to get into much of it here on air today. But it's a lot bigger obviously
[03:46.840 --> 03:53.720]  than Joe Rogan. It's about all of our speech and where this is all going. So coming up
[03:53.720 --> 03:58.480]  in the third segment, I'm going to go ahead and get into the Joe Rogan stuff a little
[03:58.480 --> 04:09.920]  bit because when you've got that snot-nosed globalist prince, Harry, and his dumb wife
[04:09.920 --> 04:16.640]  running their mouth about Americans free speech, it's just too much. And their attempt to basically
[04:16.640 --> 04:22.800]  kick him off of Spotify, if they can do that, they've already de-platformed President Trump,
[04:22.800 --> 04:27.720]  they can do anything. And it just makes me ask, when is Congress going to act with these
[04:27.720 --> 04:33.600]  psychological terrorists that are running around engaging in all this activity? But
[04:33.600 --> 04:38.760]  at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter because CNN and MSNBC and ABC and NBC, they've
[04:38.760 --> 04:43.200]  already all extincted themselves. So they can shut down Alex Jones, they can try to
[04:43.200 --> 04:49.720]  shut down Joe Rogan, they try to shut you up, but they can't shut us all up. So Joe Rogan's
[04:49.720 --> 05:01.480]  fight is all of our fights. It's just like info wars. Fight is everybody's fight. We'll
[05:01.480 --> 05:07.640]  be right back. Stay with us. Reset wars is the key. Reset wars is an amazing and eye-opening
[05:07.640 --> 05:13.920]  tool. It really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily
[05:13.920 --> 05:19.400]  go across political lines or religious lines, but about all of us as a human species coming
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.840]  together. I'm a combat veteran and, I mean, that brought me close to God, but what Alex
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.720]  goes through brought me even closer. I can feel God in my life now. The viruses that
[05:29.720 --> 05:34.560]  Alex talks to you about that are subconsciously programmed into your brain and how to erase
[05:34.560 --> 05:40.520]  those programs and install new. Reset wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular
[05:40.520 --> 05:45.720]  info wars broadcasts. It's an academic level course that will raise your awareness and
[05:45.720 --> 05:50.400]  help you live a more conscious and self-determined life. If you're on the fence about reset wars,
[05:50.400 --> 06:08.720]  it's time to get off the fence. Join reset wars today. From the front lines of the information
[06:08.720 --> 06:32.200]  war, it's Alex Jones. Here we are on this Monday, January 31st, 2022, worldwide broadcast.
[06:32.200 --> 06:39.200]  I am your host Alex Jones, very honored and pleased and blessed to be here in your presence.
[06:39.200 --> 06:44.120]  All right. I think the best way for me to start this broadcast is just read over some
[06:44.120 --> 06:50.560]  of the headlines here and then drill into them for you. Hong Kong government says commenting
[06:50.560 --> 06:56.920]  on its COVID strategy is not illegal as the Chinese Communist call for the arrest of anyone
[06:56.920 --> 07:05.920]  that questions the official COVID narrative. 48% of Democrats registered Democrats in a
[07:05.920 --> 07:11.520]  large national Rasmussen poll two weeks ago said they want to put people that don't take
[07:11.520 --> 07:17.640]  shots in camps and take their children. Just to give you an idea of who the authoritarians
[07:17.640 --> 07:26.840]  are here, ladies and gentlemen. Sue Gray report reveals failure of leadership over boozy number
[07:26.840 --> 07:34.640]  10 lockdown parties. Notice that everybody's getting on board. This is a Psyop. The rulers
[07:34.640 --> 07:39.200]  had secret parties when we were locked up in our houses. That's how they train the little
[07:39.200 --> 07:44.560]  people to then enforce and call for more lockdowns because they're getting back at the establishment
[07:44.560 --> 07:53.560]  by demanding they be locked up too. That's reverse psychology. Reports slams lockdown
[07:53.560 --> 08:01.640]  parties by Boris Johnson and staff. Oh, are you talking about the 100,000 acre ranches
[08:01.640 --> 08:11.080]  and 200,000 acre farms and mountaintop armored redoubts and 300 foot, 400 foot yachts and
[08:11.080 --> 08:15.000]  how the globalists have a blue pass in the Pacific where they go all around to their
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.320]  private islands and then to Australia and New Zealand without going through any type
[08:19.320 --> 08:24.400]  of customs? Oh, no, there's not a real analysis of how the globalists are above what they've
[08:24.400 --> 08:30.520]  done to us. It's all about, oh, Boris Johnson, after he dutifully serves the globalist, now
[08:30.520 --> 08:36.480]  he's politically destroyed and now they burn him for not following the COVID restrictions,
[08:36.480 --> 08:44.440]  which again helps their overall agenda. So see what it does for you to serve evil. Bioethicist
[08:44.440 --> 08:49.520]  mandatory vaccines should also be imposed for measles and the flu. That's a big article
[08:49.520 --> 08:55.960]  on infowars.com. Think twice before you vaccinate your kids, as Dr. Robert Malone warns parents
[08:55.960 --> 09:02.320]  of COVID-19 shots, which are experimental and have on the inserts say can kill you and
[09:02.320 --> 09:06.320]  the EU regulatory body says don't give it to children now. The UK body is now saying
[09:06.320 --> 09:10.200]  don't give it to children now. They had to make three rounds of the boards at the FDA
[09:10.200 --> 09:17.560]  and CDC resign last year when they said don't take it, it's dangerous. But CNN wants Alex
[09:17.560 --> 09:24.760]  Jones taken off the air and Joe Rogan taken off the air because Dr. Malone came on infowars
[09:24.760 --> 09:30.920]  and on Rogan and talked about reality. I mean, who does he think he is, the inventor of this
[09:30.920 --> 09:39.320]  technology or something? And then you get all the fake news push. It's all been planned.
[09:39.320 --> 09:45.640]  You wonder how they're going to go at Joe Rogan. I told him a month ago I said Blackrock
[09:45.640 --> 09:57.600]  is going to come after you. And then Blackrock did. Blackrock is buying up all the major
[09:57.600 --> 10:04.460]  music catalogs and then using that as political power to say if you don't do what we want,
[10:04.460 --> 10:11.000]  we will pull this because they have unlimited fiat money. They're the top of the food chain
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.840]  of the predatory system. And so they already drive down the stock market with their Russia
[10:17.840 --> 10:23.360]  war garbage in the last two weeks and then they claim oh, that's why Spotify lost $2 billion
[10:23.360 --> 10:28.460]  because of Joe Rogan. None of it's true, but it's designed to then spook other investors
[10:28.460 --> 10:32.720]  away to terrorize the alternate platform that by the way took me off years ago and is a
[10:32.720 --> 10:38.760]  big sensor to set the precedent that there's nowhere you can go, there's nowhere that you're
[10:38.760 --> 10:44.640]  going to have speech. And I'll get to more of that next segment. Freedom. Dutch truckers
[10:44.640 --> 10:49.160]  join Canadians in convoying against lockdown measures. Same thing in Australia, the U.S.
[10:49.160 --> 10:55.000]  and more, it's huge. More freedom convoys launched in Europe and Australia to shut down
[10:55.000 --> 11:04.400]  COVID tyranny. See some of the amazing videos and also memes at infowars.com. Let's go.
[11:04.400 --> 11:10.680]  Brand new. Freedom convoy delivers massive haul of hilarious Trudeau memes. We've got
[11:10.680 --> 11:13.760]  the really serious news on this front, though, that I'm about to hit in a moment. The death
[11:13.760 --> 11:20.680]  panels have been here for a long time, but now they're really coming out in the open.
[11:20.680 --> 11:26.080]  But separately, I want this to really burn into listeners. Joe was getting censored by
[11:26.080 --> 11:36.920]  YouTube two and a half, three years ago. And having them call him up and having their vice
[11:36.920 --> 11:42.240]  presidents and presidents talk down to him and recommend things they wanted and oh, why
[11:42.240 --> 11:49.280]  don't you have my friend on? Them trying to make him their slave, kind of like Harvey
[11:49.280 --> 11:53.720]  Weinstein turned movie stars into slaves. Joe thought, well, I need to get a contract
[11:53.720 --> 11:59.240]  with somebody. So at least if they're going to censor me, then it breaks a contract. And
[11:59.240 --> 12:08.760]  that's what he's got with Spotify is a contract. But if they can censor him, if they can control
[12:08.760 --> 12:15.000]  him, if they can shut him down, well, they can get away with anything. And that makes
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.440]  big tech the real power where they don't let you talk about the alternative treatments
[12:19.440 --> 12:24.560]  that have almost 100% rate of success that they're blocking where they don't let you
[12:24.560 --> 12:30.320]  review other drugs they're putting out. They want to silence you, which is the essence of
[12:30.320 --> 12:35.360]  authoritarianism. And on a scale of one to 10, we're not a three or a four or a five
[12:35.360 --> 12:39.920]  or a six or a seven or an eight or a nine. We are at a nine and a half ladies and gentlemen
[12:39.920 --> 12:44.720]  with a level of surveillance and censorship and control. And that last half a percent
[12:44.720 --> 12:50.200]  is mass arrest and mass roundups and forced labor camps and executions. You're just one
[12:50.200 --> 12:55.720]  inch away from that. That's where it always goes. And that's why they've got bills introduced
[12:55.720 --> 13:00.760]  everywhere to put people in camps and quote make you work. That's on the CDC website.
[13:00.760 --> 13:05.280]  They said, well, yeah, once we shield people in place and take the children of the unvaccinated
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.680]  for their safety, we're going to keep the healthy in camps. They've got to be made to
[13:09.680 --> 13:17.520]  work in the camp. And it almost CDC website says you will work in the camp. And Hillary
[13:17.520 --> 13:23.880]  force, you know, back in the 2016 election, she said, we need camps for men to train them
[13:23.880 --> 13:29.240]  how to behave. She was deadly serious. And the camps are being built all over the world
[13:29.240 --> 13:34.760]  in Australia, in Austria, in the UK, in Spain, in the US and Canada. And they're just big
[13:34.760 --> 13:38.200]  sprawling giant facilities everywhere. You think they're about to stop the lockdowns
[13:38.200 --> 13:41.800]  and stop the tyranny? No, they're only backing off a little to make you go back to sleep.
[13:41.800 --> 13:47.680]  And then they're going to hit you 10 times harder. Her time lapses of the camps being
[13:47.680 --> 13:55.120]  built in China. And then, oh, everybody's got to copy China. There's big articles out
[13:55.120 --> 14:00.000]  today. Hey, China is going to make everybody eat synthetic meat. Well, we will too. China's
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.120]  doing a new lockdown. We should too. China uses the vaccine passport as a social score.
[14:06.120 --> 14:15.940]  We should too. And it just sets the precedent that, oh, your pass is slashing red report
[14:15.940 --> 14:20.760]  to the camp. Now show folks the Australian camp, show them the UK camps, show them the
[14:20.760 --> 14:27.760]  US camps. Yeah, there's the CDC website on screen for you. What else is on the CDC website?
[14:27.760 --> 14:38.280]  Not just the camps or the shield operations. No. It's on their website from October 2020
[14:38.280 --> 14:43.600]  for one injection of a given in the US saying the COVID-19 vaccine that had changed definition
[14:43.600 --> 14:49.760]  of the vaccine is going to cause heart attacks, heart swelling, blood clots, cancer, infertility
[14:49.760 --> 14:59.720]  because they knew, they knew just always remember that this is a giant exercise in getting nurses
[14:59.720 --> 15:06.400]  and police and medical workers and the military involved in your body and your life, disappearing
[15:06.400 --> 15:11.280]  people in trucks when they dare go outside without a mask of their vaccine passport and
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.840]  loading old women and children into the backs of paddy wagons. So they just disappear to
[15:15.840 --> 15:22.760]  a place where they forcibly inject you because remember, I've got it here in the news, we'll
[15:22.760 --> 15:31.360]  cover it coming up bottom of the hour. China now admits, oh yeah, it's not just a green
[15:31.360 --> 15:34.600]  symbol when you get allowed to go outside your house. It's red as well. If you're a political
[15:34.600 --> 15:38.980]  dissident, we don't let you travel. And this just trains you. Walmart's putting in scanners
[15:38.980 --> 15:45.200]  when you come in in Canada, where you've got a scan to be able to even go in to the store.
[15:45.200 --> 15:49.320]  This is the mark of the beast. This is the control grid. This is the beginning of the
[15:49.320 --> 15:55.000]  authoritarian takeover. And anyone being part of it is aiding and abetting the destruction
[15:55.000 --> 16:03.720]  of humanity and mass depopulation. Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill. And it
[16:03.720 --> 16:09.520]  is the fastest growing market in supplements in the world for good reason. There are a
[16:09.520 --> 16:15.360]  lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some not, that do incredible things in our

[16:21.000 --> 16:25.960]  that is linked to any problems or any type of toxicity or any type of extreme hangovers.
[16:25.960 --> 16:29.400]  I mean, because I'm not saying some of our brain products, you won't have a little bit
[16:29.400 --> 16:32.960]  of a let down once you take them, but that would be a lie. But these are very, very clean

[16:57.680 --> 16:59.440]  you out there.
[16:59.440 --> 17:04.320]  With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big
[17:04.320 --> 17:09.560]  lockdown, with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage cyber attack, with the
[17:09.560 --> 17:16.160]  deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia, with the
[17:16.160 --> 17:21.400]  massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain rate
[17:21.400 --> 17:28.200]  nouns, you need to get prepared now with high quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[17:28.200 --> 17:33.200]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at preparewithalix.com has offered
[17:33.200 --> 17:41.240]  their storable food at 25% off, four years. But right now it's 25% off until February
[17:41.240 --> 17:49.400]  13th, 2022, a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com
[17:49.400 --> 17:55.760]  on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply. Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely
[17:55.760 --> 18:00.320]  essential for everybody that wants to be self sufficient. I've been fighting as hard as
[18:00.320 --> 18:06.440]  I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to
[18:06.440 --> 18:12.000]  wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational. But we
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.400]  failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but
[18:16.400 --> 18:22.520]  they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset. And that's
[18:22.520 --> 18:26.600]  why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[18:26.600 --> 18:31.240]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[18:31.240 --> 18:34.560]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've
[18:34.560 --> 18:38.360]  also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality
[18:38.360 --> 18:44.080]  storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[18:44.080 --> 18:48.120]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[18:48.120 --> 18:53.480]  to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long
[18:53.480 --> 19:00.400]  lines and waits. Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[19:00.400 --> 19:04.920]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul. I've ever had in
[19:04.920 --> 19:12.760]  my 47 years on this planet. I've had a lot of loss. Everybody else has. And it's because
[19:12.760 --> 19:21.880]  it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and
[19:21.880 --> 19:29.400]  sweat for. And now we're just throwing it all away. And I see the general public in a
[19:29.400 --> 19:35.200]  medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled trance.
[19:35.200 --> 19:41.120]  And I know we're being fed into this global speaker under and it's so incredibly sad.
[19:41.120 --> 19:48.280]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[19:48.280 --> 19:53.560]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again. It's just the globalist are actively
[19:53.560 --> 19:58.040]  trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the
[19:58.040 --> 20:01.680]  species as we know it.
[20:01.680 --> 20:26.320]  Being a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:26.320 --> 20:33.480]  The world millions of people are marching and peacefully demonstrating and saying no
[20:33.480 --> 20:43.240]  to the UN World Government biomedical tyranny. Now, I don't cover celebrity news and I don't
[20:43.240 --> 20:46.880]  care about celebrities. I don't care about Hollywood or I don't care about DC and New
[20:46.880 --> 20:52.720]  York and LA. I'm done with it a long time ago. I didn't care about it 20 years ago,
[20:52.720 --> 21:00.120]  but I hate it now. But with Joe Rogan, it's very fascinating because I always liked Joe.
[21:00.120 --> 21:04.720]  Met Joe in like 1998. Got to become friends with him in 99. And we have done a lot of
[21:04.720 --> 21:10.280]  stuff and hung out and just done a lot of amazing things publicly and privately in the
[21:10.280 --> 21:15.120]  last 20 plus years.
[21:15.120 --> 21:23.720]  And it's very surreal to see the corporate media so angry that their top news shows on
[21:23.720 --> 21:29.680]  broadcast TV have 2 million viewers. CNN's top shows have 800,000 viewers. Their average
[21:29.680 --> 21:40.460]  show 100,000. And to watch all of them up there as self-appointed thought crime police
[21:40.460 --> 21:49.920]  are prison guards over our minds, literally calling Joe's listeners stupid. When of anything,
[21:49.920 --> 21:58.360]  Joe does have a wide-ranging free-for-all of liberals, conservatives, Christians, agnostics,
[21:58.360 --> 22:05.880]  scientists, you name it on. And the fact is they don't like free speech and they don't
[22:05.880 --> 22:11.480]  like people that are popular when they're not. Joe's average show has 11 million views
[22:11.480 --> 22:22.200]  just on Spotify. And that's people that go watch a large portion of it. This show, conservatively
[22:22.200 --> 22:29.840]  every day, on terrestrial radio, 3 million listeners, internet-wise, 2, 3 million conservatively,
[22:29.840 --> 22:37.480]  that's 6 times CNN's biggest shows or more. Joe's 20 times bigger, 30 times bigger with
[22:37.480 --> 22:45.080]  their bigger shows, 40 times bigger. And it's not about who's big, it's about the people
[22:45.080 --> 22:57.640]  want freedom. The people don't want Oliver Darcy and Super Mr. Potato Head from Mars
[22:57.640 --> 23:04.960]  attacks, Brian Stelter. They are a laughing stock. They are a hated commodity. They are
[23:04.960 --> 23:12.320]  a joke and they know it. But here's why they're dangerous. Because they're sitting up there
[23:12.320 --> 23:18.240]  knowing they have the full power of the military industrial complex that owns AT&T and the
[23:18.240 --> 23:24.080]  NSA. And so they have the satisfaction that the power structure is behind them and that
[23:24.080 --> 23:30.040]  they are zombies. They don't have viewers, they don't have listeners. They're politically
[23:30.040 --> 23:40.440]  dead. But they still are alive. And they have one mission. What is zombies mission? Brains.
[23:40.440 --> 23:47.520]  That's the archetype. Brains. They don't like the fact that we've got brains. They don't
[23:47.520 --> 23:54.880]  like the fact that we think for ourselves and they want our brains. So if you ever wondered
[23:54.880 --> 24:01.240]  who the traders would be, you're looking at it. I mean, think about Brian Williams. Disgraced,
[24:01.240 --> 24:05.240]  caught in lies a decade ago, caught in lies five years ago, caught in lies two years ago.
[24:05.240 --> 24:17.160]  He was NBC's fact checker when he was the known liar. He finally with zero ratings quit.
[24:17.160 --> 24:21.800]  He declared that America was an evil bad place. No America is a good, hardworking, amazing
[24:21.800 --> 24:28.880]  place that has woken up and recognized that you people are authoritarian monsters. And
[24:28.880 --> 24:35.120]  we have rejected you. So you can force feed the young Turks and you can force feed Rachel
[24:35.120 --> 24:44.800]  Maddow and you can force feed Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi, but we reject you. So I
[24:44.800 --> 24:49.160]  know the inside baseball on Joe Rogan and there's no point in just telling us inside
[24:49.160 --> 24:55.560]  baseball just to say, Hey, here's what's really going on. Aren't I important? But parts of
[24:55.560 --> 24:59.600]  this are important for people to know for the fight for liberty. So I'll get into a little
[24:59.600 --> 25:03.200]  bit of it. And I think it's all pretty much self evident what's going on. So I don't need
[25:03.200 --> 25:09.560]  to hold anything back too much because the enemy already knows what's going on. They've
[25:09.560 --> 25:15.680]  got it. The phone's tapped everything. Joe doesn't like being pushed around. Joe wanted
[25:15.680 --> 25:23.760]  to believe in the system, but now knows it's at war with the people. And Joe is very delicately
[25:23.760 --> 25:31.680]  in a process of letting them attack him and engage him to massively expand his broadcasts.
[25:31.680 --> 25:36.560]  And then if they are able to cancel his Spotify contract, which I wouldn't hold your breath
[25:36.560 --> 25:43.760]  with, he's got something even bigger planned and I'll just leave it at that because Joe
[25:43.760 --> 25:49.480]  knows that people want the rebel. People want the American people want the people that are
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.880]  for the people. People want populism. I've instinctively always done that. So that's
[25:53.880 --> 25:59.480]  why we've always been popular. I didn't as a business model go out and be a populist
[25:59.480 --> 26:02.760]  because I thought that would be the most successful thing to do. Now I did it from access TV and
[26:02.760 --> 26:10.360]  local radio and from the top down the system has been attacking me the entire time because
[26:10.360 --> 26:17.200]  I came up from the bottom. But with Joe, he really is a blue collar guy from Boston, but
[26:17.200 --> 26:22.520]  he doesn't like thugs and bullies in the system. And he is a genuinely good guy. That's why
[26:22.520 --> 26:25.880]  I told you five years ago when I got really mad at him, they need to get straight and
[26:25.880 --> 26:30.560]  come out against the new old order because Joe knows everything I know and probably more.
[26:30.560 --> 26:35.080]  I mean, I said this couple of years ago, people said, oh, Jones quit the fending Rogan. He's
[26:35.080 --> 26:40.400]  a sellout. And I said, you watch. He told me that he's going to go after the system,
[26:40.400 --> 26:48.000]  but he's going to do it his way. And now you've seen that done. And so that's why we should
[26:48.000 --> 26:58.080]  support him. And so that's where we are. But Joe also understands if he died in the plane
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.880]  crash tomorrow or if I got run over by a truck tomorrow, people want freedom and they have
[27:02.880 --> 27:09.160]  a thirst for it and it's not going to go away. So you could try to take Alex Jones off the
[27:09.160 --> 27:13.360]  air. You could try to take Joe Rogan off the air. You could try to do all that you want.
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.720]  But as long as the people stand up and speak out and support the truth, it will defeat
[27:18.720 --> 27:26.280]  the tyrants. And so the system messing with Joe and trying to censor him and trying to
[27:26.280 --> 27:32.640]  dominate him and trying to control him, he's going to do nothing but backfire and have him
[27:32.640 --> 27:39.680]  come out against them. But because of the decentralization of technology and systems,
[27:39.680 --> 27:46.520]  Joe could start his own podcast tomorrow and serve out his three, four hour a day show
[27:46.520 --> 27:50.560]  to listeners. He could have it up and running in a week. Who knows? Maybe he's already got
[27:50.560 --> 27:57.720]  it up and running. Gee, I don't know what's here in South Austin. Anyways, the point is
[27:57.720 --> 28:04.280]  is that there are multiple death stars. And the enemy knows that. We've got death stars
[28:04.280 --> 28:09.800]  built all over the place, not just in Austin. We've got whole bases built, whole systems
[28:09.800 --> 28:18.080]  set up in other countries. You think we're going to let Brian Stelter silence us? So
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.680]  look, the enemy knows what's going on. They got our phones tapped. Just believe me, listeners,
[28:22.680 --> 28:28.240]  when I tell you, Alex Jones has been a busy beaver behind the scenes. And a lot of other
[28:28.240 --> 28:34.320]  people been busy little beavers. And so they can do whatever they want to me, but they're
[28:34.320 --> 28:39.560]  not stopping the signal. And they're not stopping you. You are the signal. You are the resistance.
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.680]  I've got more to talk about on this. It's a big, big deal. But man, historically put
[28:44.680 --> 28:51.840]  me in that briar patch all day long. Please. I mean, I got that little snot-nosed prince
[28:51.840 --> 28:56.680]  trying to shut down American free speech. You can't ask for a better fight than that.
[28:56.680 --> 28:57.680]  Stay with us.
[28:57.680 --> 29:16.360]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault
[29:16.360 --> 29:17.360]  on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead. The days of independent
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.400]  media are numbered. The government has made it illegal to oppose them. They are now debanking
[29:21.400 --> 29:27.640]  us behind the scenes. They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly. With practically
[29:27.640 --> 29:33.680]  half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the traitors know they can shut
[29:33.680 --> 29:40.240]  us down by force. But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially. So be it. Make
[29:40.240 --> 29:47.640]  them silence us by force. This is the final battle of the information war. Give now. Buy
[29:47.640 --> 29:54.600]  us. Donate. Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end. Victory
[29:54.600 --> 29:59.680]  or death, go now to infowarstore.com.

[33:00.800 --> 33:11.080]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:11.080 --> 33:40.960]  So here's what happened, and I don't tell you the story again to impress people,
[33:40.960 --> 33:46.200]  I tell you this because you know how powerful you are and what incredible things you can do
[33:46.200 --> 33:52.360]  with perseverance and action and what we've all done together. God put me in places throughout
[33:52.360 --> 33:57.480]  my life where I met people and experienced things that I didn't understand at the time,
[33:57.480 --> 34:02.200]  that I could later see the pieces of the puzzle put together and see God's incredible plan.
[34:02.200 --> 34:08.240]  I can't see a lot of God's plan, but I can see big pieces of it, and it's amazing,
[34:08.240 --> 34:17.320]  and I really experienced a lot. And so I knew that I had a mission to say these incredibly
[34:17.320 --> 34:22.400]  scary things that I knew were true and that were coming, and to lay it out no matter what
[34:22.400 --> 34:26.960]  happened to me or how much I got attacked, because I believe that once they launched the
[34:26.960 --> 34:32.560]  phases of what they've now done, you would see that I was right, and then you would listen
[34:32.560 --> 34:38.200]  and form a resistance to the next phase, which is to kill almost all of us, which you can now
[34:38.200 --> 34:43.200]  see, and that's a mainline understanding of top scientists and others and religious leaders
[34:43.200 --> 34:50.120]  and so many others around the world. I mean, some of the biggest yogis in India sound like
[34:50.120 --> 34:54.200]  the Alex Jones show now, and people say, well, okay, who cares about India? Well, I do. That's
[34:54.200 --> 35:01.920]  a billion, 200 million people. And you've got the heads of the Greek Orthodox Church
[35:01.920 --> 35:06.800]  and the Russian Orthodox Church sounding like Alex Jones. Well, they sounded like Alex
[35:06.800 --> 35:13.240]  Jones 2000 years ago. I mean, they know what's going on. So it's not like Alex Jones did
[35:13.240 --> 35:18.320]  all of this. We were just one of the biggest voices early on or the biggest that was able
[35:18.320 --> 35:24.080]  to reach the most people. I've done tens of thousands of radio interviews, hundreds and
[35:24.080 --> 35:28.880]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of podcasts and TV shows. I've traveled the world warning
[35:28.880 --> 35:35.600]  people. We exposed Bilderberg. We did so much together. But it was Matt Drudge first 15
[35:35.600 --> 35:40.720]  years ago linking to info wars to show Bilderberg that finally made the corporate media admit
[35:40.720 --> 35:47.600]  it even existed. And it was you supporting us that allowed it to happen. So a lot of
[35:47.600 --> 35:54.080]  people get the credit for how far we've come. But this isn't about credit. It's about realizing
[35:54.080 --> 36:00.560]  that Joe Rogan, it's an upcoming film. It's gonna be in theaters. I'm not going to talk
[36:00.560 --> 36:06.360]  about it yet, but I will soon. I'd even forgotten about this. Joe Rogan called me on 9 11 on
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.880]  my show. So I just told him wait before they're gonna blow up the World Trade Center and blame
[36:09.880 --> 36:17.520]  it on bin Laden and attack them Middle East. And he's CIA. And so Joe called me and said
[36:17.520 --> 36:21.280]  he wanted to go on air and he went on air and that's actually in the movie coming out.
[36:21.280 --> 36:33.080]  It's called Alex's war. But it's those seeds were Joe and Tucker Carlson's the same story
[36:33.080 --> 36:38.560]  went from thinking I was crazy but fun to hang out with to going all this guy's right
[36:38.560 --> 36:44.360]  about a lot of stuff to man, dude, how do you know all this? And then I'm able to basically
[36:44.360 --> 36:52.280]  say hey, it's the great reset. Hey, it's the larger plan. Here's a document. Here's a book.
[36:52.280 --> 36:57.080]  And so it's that process in and to have lived through this and to have like really felt
[36:57.080 --> 37:08.520]  a mission when I was 21 22 years old first getting on air of really having like a psychic
[37:08.520 --> 37:13.840]  imprint on me of knowing what was going to come and knowing what was going to happen
[37:13.840 --> 37:20.000]  and knowing I had this mission to execute it and then watching all these doors open
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.680]  at the grassroots level and just all these people that came through my life that knew
[37:23.680 --> 37:31.440]  so much that gave me their knowledge that we really have gotten the jump on the globalist.
[37:31.440 --> 37:35.360]  I mean, they got the jump on us building the system, dumbing us down, setting up all these
[37:35.360 --> 37:39.600]  programs and operations and they thought they were totally confident. They thought they
[37:39.600 --> 37:43.120]  would just roll us up and we'd all be drugged out of our minds and entertained out of our
[37:43.120 --> 37:49.680]  minds and they would just slowly kill us. But instead, we planted so many seeds that
[37:49.680 --> 37:54.320]  when the tyranny comes, it's like the sunlight and the water that makes the seeds germinate,
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.680]  that makes the seeds sprout, that makes the seeds grow. And so now it's the immovable
[37:59.680 --> 38:08.440]  object comes into contact with the unstoppable force. And the globalists are this immobile
[38:08.440 --> 38:12.240]  object of evil that want total power and control and aren't going to ever give up. And then
[38:12.240 --> 38:18.480]  you've got God's will of liberty and freedom through us. It's an unstoppable force. What
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.360]  happens when the immovable object comes in contact with the unstoppable force? And so
[38:23.360 --> 38:32.480]  that's where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen. That's where we are. And so I have
[38:32.480 --> 38:41.720]  a lot of sense of satisfaction like when you've been out doing a long swim in the ocean, get
[38:41.720 --> 38:48.160]  a little tired, gulp a little water down, scares you a little. You've got a half mile
[38:48.160 --> 38:51.600]  to swim back to shore. You decide you were going to swim to that island because you're
[38:51.600 --> 38:57.320]  a man. And you finally get back on that beach, you just roll over on your back and you just
[38:57.320 --> 39:02.320]  go, oh, thank God I got back to shore. And that's the feeling I've got right now. But
[39:02.320 --> 39:08.720]  then I look out on the horizon and a giant tidal wave is coming to swamp the island we're
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.480]  on. So we've already made it through the ocean together. We've already gone through this insane
[39:13.480 --> 39:21.680]  time together. And as much as I want to lay here on the beach and drink coconut milk and
[39:21.680 --> 39:28.320]  hang out with my lady. Sorry, folks. Get your binoculars out. It's coming. And it's worse.
[39:28.320 --> 39:33.240]  It's going to swamp the whole island. What are we going to do? And that's where we're
[39:33.240 --> 39:39.160]  at, ladies and gentlemen. No time to lay on our backs. No time to stare up at the palm
[39:39.160 --> 39:45.240]  trees. Because our children are counting on us. And this is so damn real. But at the end
[39:45.240 --> 39:49.800]  of the day, realize it's about who you personally are inside and God's watching you in this
[39:49.800 --> 39:56.160]  test. And it's about who you're going to be during these times of adversity. And I used
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.080]  to want to make fun of Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy because they really are pathetic
[40:00.080 --> 40:04.680]  people. But you know, looking at a fallen destroyed person that joined evil because they were
[40:04.680 --> 40:13.040]  so powerless is a defeat for all of us. Their failure, their succumbing to Satan, their
[40:13.040 --> 40:21.600]  service to evil is a blemish on us all. So when you see their arrogance and their hatred,
[40:21.600 --> 40:25.440]  they're mad at themselves that they didn't join with populism and God's plan. They didn't
[40:25.440 --> 40:29.920]  join with life. They joined with death because they wanted power. They wanted substance.
[40:29.920 --> 40:34.840]  And they can't even look around themselves and see how physically ugly everyone is,
[40:34.840 --> 40:39.840]  how physically weak everyone is, because that's a manifestation of who you are. You're
[40:39.840 --> 40:45.840]  the losers. You're Satan's cannon fodder. And I just want to hope and pray that people
[40:45.840 --> 40:51.800]  like Oliver Darcy and Brian Stelter and others and this woman have some type of soul so they
[40:51.800 --> 40:56.720]  can come back to reality before it's too late and reject what they're doing. You've launched
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.600]  a biomedical tyranny that's designed to erase immune systems and cancer and heart attacks
[41:01.600 --> 41:08.040]  is off the charts. You're never going to get away with this. You're like political suicide
[41:08.040 --> 41:14.200]  bombers and you're not part of the power structure. You're fools. Here's some of these control
[41:14.200 --> 41:15.400]  freaks had to say.
[41:15.400 --> 41:19.920]  Kat, you wrote on Twitter about Spotify. You went viral for a comment about it yesterday.
[41:19.920 --> 41:23.800]  Tell us your point of view first about this Spotify mess because it's really dominated
[41:23.800 --> 41:24.800]  the week.
[41:24.800 --> 41:31.880]  Yeah. What I think is interesting about the backlash against Spotify vis-à-vis Joe Rogan
[41:31.880 --> 41:40.840]  is that people are fundamentally angry about not being able to stop his audience from wanting
[41:40.840 --> 41:47.120]  news that is bad for them, wanting something that's bad for them. So we're all haunted.
[41:47.120 --> 41:50.840]  Back it up to the start of her again. I mean, if you want a definition of being not self-aware,
[41:50.840 --> 41:56.640]  you want a definition of a control freak and an idiot. Oh, people are mad. You mean the
[41:56.640 --> 42:02.480]  power structure is mad. No, the people are mad at you. Brian Stelter has 200,000 views.
[42:02.480 --> 42:07.680]  Okay. It's a joke.
[42:07.680 --> 42:11.680]  People don't like you. People are mad at you. That's why they don't want to be around you.
[42:11.680 --> 42:16.360]  See, when someone's real popular, that means it's the opposite. It's like a restaurant
[42:16.360 --> 42:20.640]  that's got cars around the block and lines out the door. You know that's got good food.
[42:20.640 --> 42:23.600]  The restaurant with like one car and looks like one lights on, you're like, I'm going
[42:23.600 --> 42:32.480]  to get food poisoning there. So see CNN is the rickety restaurant with black smoke coming
[42:32.480 --> 42:36.520]  out the back. It looks like a crack dealer is out front and you see maybe one person
[42:36.520 --> 42:40.440]  behind the counter. You think, oh, that's a front. If I want methamphetamine, I go in
[42:40.440 --> 42:44.840]  there. They're not me, but Joe Rogan's got lines around the block. You just smell the
[42:44.840 --> 42:50.560]  hamburgers cooking. And again, no amount of your censorship is ever going to stop the
[42:50.560 --> 42:55.120]  fact that we reject you. We don't like you. We're going to come back and put the rest
[42:55.120 --> 43:00.760]  of it. Stay with us.
[43:00.760 --> 43:06.320]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill and it is the fastest growing market

[43:28.120 --> 43:31.400]  some of our brain products. You won't have a little bit of a let down once you take them.
[43:31.400 --> 43:35.360]  That would be a lie. But these are very, very clean compounds that God gave us that are

[44:00.520 --> 44:05.800]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[44:05.800 --> 44:11.400]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[44:11.400 --> 44:17.680]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com. Studies have
[44:17.680 --> 44:23.640]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[44:23.640 --> 44:29.240]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[44:29.240 --> 44:35.720]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[44:35.720 --> 44:42.760]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[44:42.760 --> 44:48.920]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[44:48.920 --> 44:55.320]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[44:55.320 --> 44:59.320]  a friend, family member or yourself at infowarstore.com.

[45:53.480 --> 46:04.840]  With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big
[46:04.840 --> 46:10.040]  lockdown, with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack, with the
[46:10.040 --> 46:16.680]  deep state pushing a civil war, not just here but in Europe and war with Russia, with the
[46:16.680 --> 46:22.280]  massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain breakdowns,
[46:22.280 --> 46:28.840]  you need to get prepared now with high-quality, storable food that is ready to ship. And it's
[46:28.840 --> 46:34.200]  been four years since my Patriot supply at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered their storable
[46:34.200 --> 46:44.120]  food at 25% off for years. But right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022, a little over two
[46:44.120 --> 46:51.640]  weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com on the entire catalog
[46:51.640 --> 46:57.480]  of my Patriot supply. Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that
[46:57.480 --> 46:58.760]  wants to be self-sufficient.
[47:00.840 --> 47:06.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:13.720 --> 47:18.280]  And we're back live here on The Alex Jones Show. Only here because of your support and your prayer
[47:18.280 --> 47:23.160]  and your word of mouth. I salute and thank you all. All right, I want to explain something to
[47:23.160 --> 47:27.560]  the listeners because I know if you understand this, you'll understand where I'm coming from.
[47:27.560 --> 47:33.160]  And I think this is where you're coming from, probably most of you. See, I don't take this
[47:33.160 --> 47:38.760]  as a radio talk show. I don't take this as a popularity contest. I don't take this as a game.
[47:38.760 --> 47:46.360]  I'm in a war. And my mission in risking my life and my treasure and my family is to beat these
[47:46.360 --> 47:53.000]  people because that's what the Holy Spirit demands. And that's what I'm guided by. I have become
[47:53.000 --> 47:58.680]  willingly possessed by it. In fact, I constantly try to get it more in control of me so it can
[47:58.680 --> 48:11.320]  push out my worldliness and my sinful nature. And the reason I raise that is the enemy's
[48:11.320 --> 48:21.000]  prosecuting a war against us. Trump said it when he was speaking just a few days ago here in Texas
[48:21.800 --> 48:25.480]  and then again in other states. He said, they're trying to put me in prison. They're trying to
[48:25.480 --> 48:29.800]  silence me because they want to get you and it's true. They want you all. You think they just want
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.720]  to ship your jobs overseas and ship fentanyl in and teach your young boys they're really girls
[48:33.720 --> 48:38.360]  and cut their penises off? That's just the start of this. They want you dead. Of course,
[48:38.360 --> 48:42.680]  they're hitting you with a tainted bio weapon that the poor doctors and nurses don't even know
[48:42.680 --> 48:48.360]  what it is. And now they do know when they speak out, they get censored because it's so horrible
[48:48.360 --> 48:55.960]  what they're doing. How could somebody get their mind around it? Well, finally, Joe Rogan got his
[48:55.960 --> 49:08.760]  mind around it. I was on his show about 14 months ago. Had about 40 million views plus. And if you
[49:08.760 --> 49:15.560]  go back and watch that show, it's everything predicted that's now happened. And you see that's
[49:15.560 --> 49:22.760]  the final piece with somebody like Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan is they now know this is on purpose.
[49:22.760 --> 49:28.280]  They now know this is depopulation. They now know it all. They don't have to tune it to Alex Jones
[49:28.280 --> 49:35.320]  anymore. Now they see it. And that's the tipping point and the point of victory. And that's where
[49:35.320 --> 49:43.400]  we are, ladies and gentlemen. And so once we get the general public to that point, it's game over
[49:43.400 --> 49:46.440]  for the globalists. We won't need a violent revolution. We won't need any of that. People
[49:46.440 --> 49:51.400]  will see through all of the agenda. They will reject it at every level. And the collapse of
[49:51.400 --> 49:57.560]  corporate media is emblematic of the fact that the system is over. The collapse of
[50:01.640 --> 50:10.040]  Hollywood is again the main indicator. And so everything they're throwing at us, all the nastiness
[50:11.080 --> 50:17.000]  that they're engaged in trying to break our will is their failure. It's their death rattle.
[50:17.000 --> 50:24.840]  It's their writhing angrily because they know they're going down. I use the analogy of
[50:25.640 --> 50:32.600]  Blade Runner when Decker shoots, press the last female replicant in the stomach and she
[50:32.600 --> 50:37.640]  knows she's dying and she throws that big fit. That's what they're doing right now.
[50:39.720 --> 50:43.160]  And they're devaluing the currency as fast as they can. They're flooding the borders as
[50:43.160 --> 50:48.040]  fast as they can. They are rolling out deadly vaccines as fast as they can. They authorized
[50:48.040 --> 50:54.520]  three months ago GMO Nanotech untested being sprayed on the food. I mean, this is what elites do
[50:54.520 --> 50:57.960]  when the public turns against them in history is they try to kill everybody.
[50:59.880 --> 51:05.560]  But they can't get away with an overt war. So they look over at war. So that's where we are.
[51:08.200 --> 51:12.680]  And a lot of people have decided because they're scared to join with this. And well,
[51:12.680 --> 51:15.800]  let me be on the winning team. They're the biggest fools of all.
[51:16.920 --> 51:21.320]  Winning is standing up for what's right. Winning is doing the right thing in God's eyes.
[51:22.120 --> 51:24.440]  And then you'll be blessed and then you'll have an incredible life.
[51:26.600 --> 51:29.880]  Serving evil destroys you very, very quickly.
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.760]  So that's the reality of this.
[51:36.760 --> 51:43.240]  We need to stay away from it while it's writhing around like a dying spider
[51:44.760 --> 51:49.400]  and not let it pull it down with us. And look our children in the eyes and explain to them
[51:49.400 --> 51:56.680]  the government's captured. It's evil. America is in a decadence cycle. We're coming out of
[51:56.680 --> 52:02.040]  that cycle into rebirth. But right now is the tipping point. And we need peace and love and
[52:02.040 --> 52:08.600]  justice and understanding. But we also need to recognize the flagrant authoritarianism and the
[52:08.600 --> 52:18.760]  flagrant normalization of censorship and control and dying corporate media running around trying to
[52:18.760 --> 52:25.000]  police all the other popular shows and take them off the air because they dare have medical doctors
[52:25.000 --> 52:30.040]  on to say masks don't work, which is now admitted or that the vaccine isn't a vaccine. It doesn't
[52:30.040 --> 52:34.600]  work, which is now admitted or that it shouldn't be given to children, which is now admitted.
[52:34.600 --> 52:39.160]  The truth is they're doing something they know that's untenable and that only if we're all
[52:39.160 --> 52:43.800]  silenced and we all submit, well, let's succeed. Instead, let's come together and believe in
[52:43.800 --> 52:51.800]  humanity and say no. So I decided, as it was four years ago, when Joe was really making a bad turn
[52:51.800 --> 52:59.080]  into the establishment out in California and had gone from being super awake and knowing as much
[52:59.080 --> 53:10.600]  as I did about everything, because Joe's really smart to really going along with the system. And
[53:14.120 --> 53:20.920]  I went after him on air. And I said, Joe Rogan knows better. He knows the new world order is
[53:20.920 --> 53:26.040]  real. He knows chemtrails are real. He knows all the stuff's going on. And I said, and I know
[53:26.040 --> 53:30.280]  that he's trying to like coexist with the globalists, and that's not going to happen.
[53:30.280 --> 53:33.480]  They're going to end up censoring him. They're going to end up messing with him.
[53:33.480 --> 53:36.520]  They're going to end up trying to make you their bitch. I told this on the phone too.
[53:39.400 --> 53:43.000]  Because Joe really just wants to go be a comedian and have fun with his kids and play with his,
[53:43.000 --> 53:52.920]  you know, golden retrievers and go hunting. But see, everything I told him then came true.
[53:52.920 --> 53:57.160]  And Joe said, I'm sorry, Alex, you were right. Thanks for being mean to me to get me back on
[53:57.160 --> 54:00.680]  the straight and narrow. And I apologize to Joe on air and off. And I said, no, I was a little
[54:00.680 --> 54:07.720]  intense about it because I was so mad to know that Joe's a good guy and that he was pissing
[54:07.720 --> 54:12.440]  off his own audience and pissing everybody off. His show was going from being super popular and
[54:12.440 --> 54:16.760]  number one to becoming somewhat unpopular. I was like, what are you doing? Everybody's turning
[54:16.760 --> 54:23.640]  against you. Be a populist. Be a patriot. Reject the new world order. Do it. Or I'll give you
[54:23.640 --> 54:29.880]  something to be afraid of. And that wasn't about me acting tough. That was about my vision knowing
[54:29.880 --> 54:34.920]  when I first saw Joe get into podcasting and gave him some tips and he came to the office and,
[54:34.920 --> 54:37.880]  you know, saw the equipment and all the rest of it. This is like 13 years ago.
[54:39.960 --> 54:44.840]  I knew he'd be a key part of the fight in the future. I always had that sense of things,
[54:44.840 --> 54:49.640]  that roadmap in my mind that I was talking about earlier that I've now seen unfold.
[54:51.880 --> 54:58.040]  So that's the reality, ladies and gentlemen. And that's the important work we've done. And that's
[54:58.040 --> 55:03.000]  why your support of us has been so incredibly critical because we, that's you, the audience,
[55:03.000 --> 55:10.280]  us together have done all these things. And we're at least not going to go down without a fight
[55:10.280 --> 55:15.160]  now. And we've got a good chance of beating these people if the public can admit the full horror.
[55:15.160 --> 55:19.880]  Let's just hear a little bit more of this control freak lady on the collapsed zombie program
[55:20.840 --> 55:23.160]  that is Brian Stelter, Reliable Sources. Here it is.
[55:25.240 --> 55:31.320]  Yeah. You know, what I think is interesting about the backlash against Spotify vis-à-vis Joe Rogan
[55:31.320 --> 55:39.720]  is that, you know, people are fundamentally angry about not being able to stop his audience from
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.720]  wanting news that is bad for them, you know, wanting something that's bad for them.
[55:44.360 --> 55:51.720]  So, you know, we're all haunted by the specter of this guy. She's our mommy. It's bad for you.
[55:52.920 --> 55:57.400]  You don't get it. It's like, it's popular and tells the truth and you don't like it
[55:58.120 --> 56:05.160]  because you're a talking head on CNN, the joke. Again, this is the dying failed burnout race car
[56:05.160 --> 56:09.640]  saying that Dale Earnhardt in his prime can't be on the highway
[56:11.800 --> 56:15.560]  because they want control. They're supposed to have all the control. They're the private
[56:15.560 --> 56:19.640]  fellow reserve. They print all the money. They're the elites, but you're not the elites. Have you
[56:19.640 --> 56:24.280]  ever been to a globalist meeting? I got invited to a couple of them. A bunch of weird hunchback,
[56:24.280 --> 56:29.560]  crazy looking, inbred lunatics. All right. No, I don't want to be part of your elite group and
[56:29.560 --> 56:34.680]  hear how I'm an elitist and sit around and kiss your asses and pull chairs out for you
[56:34.680 --> 56:43.080]  so I can get $200, $400, $500 million. That isn't what I want to feather my nest with. I want to
[56:43.080 --> 56:48.760]  feather my nest with globalist political scalps of systems we've defeated and we have defeated them
[56:49.400 --> 56:53.800]  and they know it. And now they're trying to claw us back into the hole, back into the political
[56:53.800 --> 56:59.080]  grave with them. Let's continue. I'm taking news that is bad for them. You know, wanting something
[56:59.080 --> 57:05.720]  that's bad for them. So, you know, we're all haunted by the specter of this guy who's listening to
[57:05.720 --> 57:12.920]  Joe Rogan and internalizing this bad information and making bad choices as a result. But Rogan is
[57:12.920 --> 57:17.880]  like a weed that sprang up outside the mainstream media ecosystem and he thrived there and he has
[57:17.880 --> 57:22.920]  this huge audience. And that's what's really scary, that Spotify could kick him off tomorrow
[57:23.640 --> 57:28.120]  and it wouldn't make a dent. It wouldn't make a dent in his audience. People would still listen
[57:28.120 --> 57:33.720]  to him and crucially they still wouldn't trust more mainstream media sources. Oh, you finally get
[57:33.720 --> 57:40.040]  it, you witch. Oh, finally get it. That we're not going away. We're not shutting up and people
[57:40.040 --> 57:44.520]  are hungry for the truth. So, folks, be the real rebels against tyranny. Share the links from Bandod
[57:44.520 --> 58:00.280]  video and info wars.com forward slash show. Really dives deeper into yourself and into the
[58:00.280 --> 58:05.160]  bigger picture that doesn't necessarily go across political lines or religious lines,
[58:05.160 --> 58:11.320]  but about all of us as a human species coming together. I'm a combat veteran and I mean,
[58:11.320 --> 58:16.520]  that brought me close to God, but what Alex goes through brought me even closer. I can feel God
[58:16.520 --> 58:21.400]  in my life now. The viruses that Alex talks to you about that are subconsciously programmed into
[58:21.400 --> 58:27.880]  your brain and how to erase those programs and install new reset wars is a step beyond what
[58:27.880 --> 58:33.240]  you already get in regular info wars broadcasts. It's an academic level course that will raise
[58:33.240 --> 58:37.960]  your awareness and help you live a more conscious and self determined life. If you're on the fence
[58:37.960 --> 58:42.440]  about reset wars, it's time to get off the fence. Join reset wars today.
[58:51.720 --> 58:57.400]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico,
[58:57.400 --> 59:02.200]  the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[59:02.200 --> 59:07.000]  above organic and the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.520]  little farmers that you know, the media calls communist, but really they're just a commune
[59:10.520 --> 59:14.440]  and whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't
[59:14.440 --> 59:17.800]  let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been
[59:17.800 --> 59:21.560]  buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods
[59:21.560 --> 59:25.960]  under another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[59:25.960 --> 59:30.120]  you're going to find anywhere. It's wake up America patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels,
[59:30.120 --> 59:38.040]  literally. In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story. We had like that. You want to
[59:38.040 --> 59:43.480]  believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation. And if you
[59:43.480 --> 59:55.480]  don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine. If you are receiving this transmission,
[59:55.480 --> 1:00:10.200]  you are the resistance. All right, I said I'd take calls. I didn't. I'm bad.
[1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:19.160]  I got stuck on the insanity of the little stupid princeling out of the UK, trying to
[1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:23.720]  silence Joe Rogan and their talk show host. I mean, this is just insane. Like these people
[1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:28.280]  are auditioning to be the new dictators of North Korea or something. But next segment,
[1:00:28.280 --> 1:00:32.440]  I'm going to get into the real technocracy and what we're facing and why this is so
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:38.920]  diabolical and wasn't just tainted poisoned injections. That's coming up. And then we're
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:44.040]  going to have a very special guest investigative journalist on who's got the inside skinny on
[1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:50.200]  war with Russia at least ran a hand. He'll be with me in the third hour ahead of Gerald Salento
[1:00:50.200 --> 1:00:55.720]  today and are out of the war room. But let me get this out here right now. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:00:55.720 --> 1:01:07.000]  it has been four years since my Patriot supply allowed us to do 25% off on food sales. Now,
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:12.200]  they have the food ready to ship. It's super high quality. It's the lowest price you're going to find
[1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:17.720]  anywhere for food of this quality. It's what I use my family use. It's what I've stockpiled here at
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:21.480]  the office because I know the globalists want to post industrial world and want to collapse
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:29.000]  civilization. And if they're able to do it, we've got to have generators and diesel and food and
[1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:35.720]  everything, which we have. But a lot of you obviously don't have the money or the places
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:39.400]  of store stuff like this, but storeable food, you do put at the attic, put at the basement,
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:45.640]  put in the closet. They bought massive amounts of food last year and this year,
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:51.640]  because they saw the prices going way up with inflation, which did happen. But literally,
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:59.080]  only for our viewers and listeners, they are doing a once in three or four year deal of 25% off
[1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:06.040]  only for infowarstore.com shoppers. You can also go to preparewithoutlooks.com and that will take
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:11.800]  you as a URL straight to the subpage of infowarstore.com. All their specialty foods, all of their
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:18.200]  products 25% off. And what's great is we normally only make 25, 30% on the food because there's
[1:02:18.200 --> 1:02:24.040]  not a lot of markup. They make 20, 30%, we make 20, 30%. That's why they're affordable. They're
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:30.440]  not doing 200%, 300% markup. They're doing 100% and then trying to pay their bills with it.
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:35.880]  And that's why they become dominant because the price again is so low. But they are eating the
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:41.480]  25% discount and not taking it out of ours. Because when we do discounts, part of that
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:46.440]  comes out of what we make and we need money. We don't have extra money. We're a little bit in
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:52.440]  the red here. So this is a God said when they called and said, Hey, we actually don't have a
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:56.760]  lot of extra food, but we got a little bit more than what we thought we needed. And we package
[1:02:56.760 --> 1:03:01.640]  this and ship it out when it's fresh. And so it literally God laid it on our heart. These folks
[1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:06.120]  are big Christians, obviously big supporters to just help you and your listeners by giving them
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:14.120]  25% off. So this is exclusive to infowarstore.com ready hour. They've got five big facilities
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:20.200]  around the country. Their main base is Utah. And we are their biggest seller as well. But I'm telling
[1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:25.240]  you, they've got a warehouse in Utah, I was at that you could park an aircraft carrier in.
[1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:31.480]  So that's, that's, I mean, that's just the front end. That's just one 20th of it. The whole storage
[1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:36.280]  facility where the raw food comes in, his process is the whole back of the building, 80% of it.
[1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:42.120]  I mean, it is the biggest building I've ever been inside of. So in all that still ability is how
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:47.240]  they give you these great prices show. I literally Lord works mysterious ways. I said earlier,
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:50.840]  I'm sitting with accountants last week going, we got a two and a half million dollar shortfall
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:55.000]  again. We can't get a lot of the supplements in because the supply chain break down. People aren't
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.320]  going to buy $2 million worth of t-shirts. What am I going to do? I just sold my house. I'm going
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:04.920]  to put that in, but that was for expansion and new operations and backup systems. What am I going
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:10.280]  to do? And then boom, this just came right through and we're having massive sales, biggest sales
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:15.080]  of food ever. People with the Russian situation, the supply chain breakdowns, all of it understand.
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:18.680]  Now's the time not to wait. One of the big things you've got to check off on that checklist of
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:23.640]  preparedness is horrible food. They've got water filters, air filters that they're discounted to
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:29.880]  infowarstore.com or preparedness.com. And hopefully this sale runs through the 13th.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Hopefully it looks like a current sales rates. We might actually get the two and a half, three
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.880]  million dollars just perfectly in the sale that they called and said, you can do this for two weeks.
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:44.520]  So thank you God and thank you listeners for the support, but this is something you already need.
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:51.160]  So it's a 360 win and God always keeps me right on empty though, like the widows might each day
[1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:54.040]  it's renewed. So thank you Lord. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:04.680]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at
[1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:10.120]  home and the world at large. If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all

[1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:44.760]  support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by native Americans

[1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:45.560]  bad news first the way i can do something about it the worst things in my life is people not telling
[1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:51.240]  me about bad stuff going on and if we'd have had time and we didn't know and we could have stopped it
[1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:54.600]  so bottom of the hour
[1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:03.880]  we got some huge news the truth is coming out about covid deaths from the vaccine even mainline
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:08.600]  top scientist a whole new crop of them are going public
[1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:17.400]  including people that push the shot and believe the lie
[1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:32.760]  just in my stack today four super prominent doctors virologist epidemiologist pathologist
[1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:39.880]  have gone public saying oh my god they're covering it up they knew it was killing people what are we
[1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:47.880]  going to do big deal it's a big deal in fact here's one of the articles is on info wars dot
[1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:53.160]  com by dr joseph mercola we've got to get back on the truth is coming out about covid deaths and
[1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:57.400]  then he links to a bunch of these people and i mean i don't know what they're going to do
[1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:01.960]  some of these people want one of these doctors his average videos get like five million views in the
[1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:08.520]  uk and he's basically come out now against it and said my god this is a monstrous criminal activity
[1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:14.520]  so i'll say it again people try to project logic onto psychos
[1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:21.560]  people ask like why did hitler if hitler wouldn't have done the final solution and and tried to kill
[1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:26.680]  tens of millions of people people always argue the numbers there's a lot more than six million
[1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:34.200]  jews it was tens of millions of people polls slobs jews germans he killed a bunch of people gypsies
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:41.800]  but the point is is that his generals were telling hitler it's why they tried to assassinate
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:47.240]  was why urwin rommel tried to assassinate him in operation valkyrie they made a movie out of
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:51.880]  with tom cruise that's true story rommel was running the operation the ten cruise character
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:56.200]  you'll play as a part of the major to try to kill him with the bomb satchel bomb
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.920]  and then they go to hitler and they go listen you're spending half the resources killing people
[1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:09.240]  and rounding everybody up we need those troops on the front they barely got beat by the russians
[1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:15.240]  barely got turned back but hitler had millions of troops running around killing people
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:19.000]  and they'd say it doesn't matter more important to kill all these people
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:26.200]  and see he didn't just want to take over and dominate no the journey for him was the destination
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:32.520]  he wanted to kill a bunch of people and he believed in what he was doing was a good thing
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:35.720]  just like claus schwaab just like bill gates believe what they're doing is a good thing
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:47.720]  so that's at the bottom of the hour uh it's a five hour video and it does make me take heart that
[1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:52.360]  there's three or four different clips out of it that have all together got about two million views
[1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:58.120]  on bandot video but i mean this needs 50 million views it's 100 million views
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:06.040]  but we've got the full five hour boil down of the two-day event with senator ron johnson
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:15.080]  and others and see i don't just i don't just watch these clips or set up you know late at night
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:18.840]  a lot of times i go to bed at like nine o'clock but wake up at three and then do research i don't
[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:24.840]  just sit there and believe what i'm being told i already knew all this stuff the point was this
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:32.120]  is a hearing this is a this is a meeting of experts confirming it all and triple checking it
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:38.840]  and with department of defense documents see i'm never good at like just seeing it up front
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:44.200]  did you know the main department of defense ai program that's been surveilling covet for two years
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:50.920]  has conclusively proven a 40 increase in heart attacks a hundred percent increase in myocarditis
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:56.360]  a 400 plus percent increase in different types of cancer some cancers are up 20 percent i mean
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:05.800]  20 times this is all the pentagon actually put the report out six months ago they put another
[1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:11.000]  one out two months ago and that's what's covered yeah there's a bunch of versions of this one has
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:16.600]  900,000 one has 600,000 one has 400,000 one has whatever but it's about two million views on
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:22.680]  band-aute video msm blackout of medical doctors pandemic response roundtable is a crime against
[1:11:22.680 --> 1:11:29.400]  humanity that's under the bill gates is evil section but the one i'm going to play is only 20
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:36.680]  minutes long in segment four and five today at the bottom of the hour do d and fouchie caught in
[1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:43.240]  massive scandal hiding death and damage from covid vaccines and this is just 20 minutes
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:49.560]  that we're going to fit into those two segments of five hours itself that is a boil down
[1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:57.080]  and this is from the department of defense they published these numbers this isn't off
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:12:03.000]  bears that they can try to poo poo oh and it's funny even even harvard estimated that between
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:09.640]  one to five percent of bad reactions from drugs get reported so let's say it's five percent so it
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:20.280]  bears is reporting 100 something thousand deaths and 800 plus thousand bad reactions
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:30.040]  those are conservative numbers then it gets much much larger than that miscarriage is up 300 percent
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:37.720]  cancer is up 300 again the numbers vary neurological cases 1000 percent this is from
[1:12:38.360 --> 1:12:47.240]  the pentagon hooked into everything scooping up all of the hospital medicare medicaid everything
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:58.120]  data and of course it's way worse than what bear says so i want that to sink in real good
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:03.720]  to everybody okay you think i'm up here risking my life and my family and everything because
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:07.960]  because because i just like to risk my life no i'm not a rock climber i'm not a skydiver
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:12.600]  i'm not scared to do that stuff i've done that stuff not the skydiving but i've jumped off 300
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:19.320]  foot railroad trestles i've rock climbed and later i thought man i just fell 20 feet and almost
[1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:23.240]  broke my leg i think i'm gonna quit doing this and i'm not against folks to do it my point is
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:30.840]  i don't take risk just to take risk if i need to take a risk i can flip off the fear switch
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:39.720]  and make my ass do whatever i need to but i've got such concern about them winning that that
[1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:50.280]  actually i do all of this out of fear now once you extinct fear you don't feel the fear but
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:54.360]  deep down i know this is evil and is bad so i've got to make a decision to fight it and once i
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:58.440]  make the decision there's no more fear now i'm committed to the fight now i don't care what
[1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:02.200]  you say about me now i don't care what you do to me now i don't care because i've got to do this
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:07.080]  and it doesn't matter but if the general public knew how they've been conned and how they've been
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:11.320]  lied to and how much danger they're in these globalists would never get away with any of this
[1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:18.040]  they'd all be in prison and they know what they've done and that's why they're so desperate to start
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:24.040]  wars and collapse society and civilization where the situation is so bad and so dire where you can't
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:30.520]  put food on your table that you're not even gonna sit there and think about going after the globalists
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:35.320]  because you can't even get transport to drive down the street to protest and i remember minutes
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:42.280]  leaked out of the bill berg group 20 years ago 20 years ago it was about 2002 and they were talking
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:47.480]  about how we want to make everybody so poor that they can't move and they can't protest and they
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:52.680]  can't live and then we can do whatever we want by breaking down society and having a post-industrial
[1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:57.320]  world and that's what the covid lockdowns are and that's what the vaccine passports are and that's
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:03.080]  what all of this is and i'll cover that when we come back you're being put into the jail cell
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:09.160]  you don't need to get put in prison folks the whole planet is being turned into a giant prison
[1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:15.000]  and i've explained this to everybody and i've explained this to joe rugan
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:20.600]  it don't matter buddy if you got a billion bucks oh yeah joe's got a lot more money most people know
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:28.360]  it doesn't matter if you're not part of the globalist club that money will mean nothing in the future
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:32.440]  plus do you want to be in the globalist club where they tell you what to do and tell you what to say
[1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:37.880]  and you got to kiss their ass lesser men and the answer is no i'm not going to be the slave i'm

[1:20:57.080 --> 1:21:04.120]  coward 19 has been hiding for five days from the truckers even before they arrived on saturday
[1:21:05.320 --> 1:21:10.440]  saying that he might have come well now he's tested positive covid's so real it's so deadly
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:17.240]  and then he just crawled out from under his rock and gave a speech where he says black lives matter
[1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:21.800]  knows how to protest he had three billion dollars in damage dozens dead people shot in the back of
[1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:27.960]  the head the organization stealing hundreds of millions of dollars buying mansions and
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:34.520]  private airports and jets everywhere yes this is how you're mostly peaceful so turdoe again
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:40.120]  rubbing it in says oh they're hateful they're mean i got articles law enforcement's investigating
[1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:47.160]  the evil truckers how dare you not like marshal law oh the russians are behind it no evidence but
[1:21:47.160 --> 1:21:52.120]  the russians if you don't like being locked down and having a gmo shot but in you you're a russian
[1:21:54.680 --> 1:22:01.080]  so here is justin turdoe who said quote the truckers hold unacceptable views
[1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:07.560]  who he said i want to be a dictator i like zeezy pink's dictatorship it's the best
[1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:12.760]  these are quotes the guy that said i'm following claus wabb's orders for build back better great
[1:22:12.760 --> 1:22:19.640]  reset well here's his latest gaslighting you arrogantly that's their weapons arrogance
[1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:27.240]  rubbing in your face here it is i have attended protests and rallies in the past uh when i agreed
[1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:32.680]  with the goals when i supported the people uh expressing their concerns and their issues black
[1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:39.240]  lives matter is an excellent example of that but i have also chosen to not go anywhere near
[1:22:39.240 --> 1:22:47.000]  protests that have expressed hateful rhetoric violence towards fellow citizens uh and a disrespect
[1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:53.240]  not just of science but of the frontline health workers and quite frankly the 90 percent of
[1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:59.480]  truckers who have been doing the right thing to keep canadians safe to put food on our tables
[1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:05.400]  uh canadians know where i stand this is a moment for responsible leaders to think carefully
[1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:11.720]  about where they stand and who they stand with everything he's done with the globalists is
[1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:16.360]  to shut off the food and cause the collapse and it's not 90 percent of the truckers that took the
[1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:23.880]  shot so everything out of his mouth is a fraudulent lie and remember vaccine doesn't protect you it's
[1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:28.600]  not a vaccine remember the mass don't protect you now they say you have four or five shots last year
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:34.680]  he bought shots at a 2026 he's never gonna stop this is their tyranny this is their takeover
[1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:47.800]  hiding behind medical workers unbelievable information now let's hit where this is really going

[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:24.520]  and that leads us to these articles that i'm actually going to play a very important clip
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:29.480]  that a very well-known podcaster said we're in the break dealing with this
[1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:37.400]  what is social credit scores and world ids have to do with geoengineering and soil death
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:44.120]  you didn't know soils alive yeah soil that plants grow in that black stuff is a mix of
[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:51.720]  bacteria and a lot of other little microscopic creatures and all these enzymes that keep the
[1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:57.720]  soil alive so it sticks to the ground it doesn't blow away deserts are where the soil is lost and
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:02.680]  you get death doesn't matter how much rain falls on it either there's nothing to cling to it
[1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:09.320]  nothing to make it live nothing to make it permanent the surface of the earth that it's green is a
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:23.160]  living skin and barium salts and lemon dioxide destroy it and that's why our forests are all dying
[1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:29.480]  and the very people telling you they're taking over to protect the earth or the ones there
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:32.760]  to carry out the murder of our precious planet and our environment
[1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:43.160]  so here it is china's five-year plan is a blueprint for the future of meat says time magazine

[1:30:36.600 --> 1:30:42.520]  it one of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally used
[1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:48.600]  by native americans like the cherries who used it for its relaxing qualities be sure to take this
[1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:54.760]  product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out selling out now
[1:30:54.760 --> 1:31:01.560]  at info wars store dot com you and run contact tracers aren't coming they're here all over the
[1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:06.520]  world from australia to the united states from canada to germany these tyrants are tracking
[1:31:06.520 --> 1:31:11.560]  everything you do everywhere you go then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:17.320]  taking people away into the night to their facilities and they're planning in the next year
[1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:22.520]  to expand their shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them
[1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:27.000]  in facilities for their safety this is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:32.120]  to fight back is to get high quality faraday cages many of which are made here in america and are
[1:31:32.120 --> 1:31:37.720]  very compliant meaning u.s. government military grade at info wars store dot com we have the

[1:31:54.600 --> 1:32:00.360]  and support the info war at info wars store dot com so when i first started taking survival
[1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:05.800]  shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was
[1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:10.600]  barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one
[1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:15.720]  i got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter
[1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:19.480]  you came out with x2 you had you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited
[1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:25.880]  about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[1:32:25.880 --> 1:32:31.320]  was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course
[1:32:31.320 --> 1:32:35.960]  of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your
[1:32:35.960 --> 1:32:40.760]  supplements they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout
[1:32:40.760 --> 1:32:45.240]  it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[1:32:45.240 --> 1:32:49.880]  is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way
[1:32:49.880 --> 1:32:55.080]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much
[1:32:55.080 --> 1:33:04.920]  for calling godspeed leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:08.920 --> 1:33:15.720]  the globalist depopulation operation can only succeed if you are silent but you will not be
[1:33:15.720 --> 1:33:24.760]  silent you will rise the occasion it is your destiny rallying patriots worldwide in defense
[1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:35.000]  of human liberty you're listening to the alex jones show please tell me uh apparently one of the
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:39.400]  whistleblowers is brave enough to come forward and give a name or i would not have allowed you to
[1:33:39.400 --> 1:33:44.760]  come yes senator so we've got three whistleblowers who've given me permission at this point to share
[1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:52.840]  their name lieutenant colonel dr teresa long do mph dr samuel sigloff and lieutenant colonel
[1:33:52.840 --> 1:33:58.840]  dr peter chambers do and flight surgeon all three of the have given me this data i have
[1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:03.800]  declarations from all three this data is under penalty this is under penalty of perjury we intend
[1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:13.000]  to submit this to the courts uh we have substantial data showing that uh we saw for example uh miscarriage
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:20.840]  is increased by 300 percent over the five-year average almost uh we saw almost 300 percent
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:25.880]  increase in cancer over the five-year average cancer is not being talked about except for
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:34.440]  by dr ryan colt thank you doctor uh we saw this one's amazing neurological so neurological issues
[1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:40.760]  which would affect our pilots over a thousand percent increase a thousand ten times that's
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:48.920]  ten times rate and obviously that was 83 thousand per year i'm sorry 82 thousand per year to 863
[1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:55.880]  thousand in one year our soldiers are being experimented on injured and sometimes possibly
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:35:02.120]  killed dr cori thank you so much for your stance on the corruption that's precisely what it is
[1:35:02.120 --> 1:35:09.000]  they know this and senator uh when these doctors are attacked not necessarily the people in this
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:14.360]  room i'm not given names they call me i'm the one dealing with the medical boards i'm the one
[1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:18.200]  watching the witch hunts i'm the one fighting them off and i'm the one telling them where to go i'm
[1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:24.120]  going to keep doing that senator we also have uh let me give you this last thing and then i'll shut
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:33.400]  up and uh get out of your way 928 2021 project salis weekly report project salis is a defense
[1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:39.560]  defense department initiative where they report and contra they take all this data that doesn't
[1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:46.040]  exist supposedly and they give it to the cdc they're watching these vaccines on that date and around
[1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:51.080]  that date i have numerous instances where fauci and that entire crew were saying it's a crisis of
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:59.160]  unvax it's 99 unvaxed in the hospital in project salis in the weekly report the do d document says
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:05.640]  specifically 71 percent of new cases are in the fully vaxed and 60 percent of hospitalizations
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:10.760]  are in the fully vaxed this is corruption at the highest level we need investigations the
[1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:17.320]  secretary of defense needs investigated the cdc needs to be investigated and thank you so much
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:25.080]  senator for having the courage to stand against these special interests so so again the department
[1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:34.680]  the department of defense thank you the department of defense the bite administration is on notice
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:43.080]  they must preserve these records and this must be investigated okay absolutely thank you so much
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:49.400]  senator thank you so the increase in cancer is something i've been hearing about for months
[1:36:49.400 --> 1:36:55.000]  and quite honestly i've told people the reporting this to me i don't think the public's quite ready
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.800]  for that yet okay but you've just raised this issue apparently dr. cole you're aware this can
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:05.240]  you talk a little bit about that because this this is this is frightening thank you senator and this
[1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:12.040]  is a challenge in terms of aggregating data i saw a signal early on of certain viral conditions
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:18.360]  dr parks pointed out mechanisms i noticed certain viruses increasing well these same t cells immune
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:26.200]  cells keep cancers in check so i do about 40 000 biopsies a year i'm a busy pathologist and i thought
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:30.760]  gosh i'm seeing more of this type of cancer and this type of cancer and this type of cancer
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:37.160]  and so i've tried to talk to other laboratories and aggregate a bigger data set which obviously
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:42.920]  these federal data sets are a very easy way to see that signal obviously i've been cancelled i've
[1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:50.280]  been ridiculed i've been um aligned etc for saying so but i've been observing it and i can't deny
[1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:54.280]  observation that's how science happens initially through observation then we confirm through
[1:37:54.280 --> 1:38:01.000]  hypothesis experiment and data so yes we're seeing it and now when we travel with these groups and
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:05.560]  summits i have oncologists i have radiation oncologists i am seeing an uptick in cancers
[1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:12.600]  i'm seeing these odd stable cancers take off like wildfires after the vaccines it is happening
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:18.040]  we need federal funding the NIH isn't looking at this getting a grant to look at anything related
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:24.200]  to the vaccines is next to impossible because they're perfect safe and effective so it's happening
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:30.920]  my data is anecdotal my observational group is significant but we need additional studies to
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:36.040]  happen and thank you to tom for digging into what's actually happening i think we have some
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:40.280]  additional nurses and by the way that's where i was getting the safety signal from nurses from
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:45.000]  across the country as they're contacting me about the vaccine mandates that type of things talking
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:48.520]  you know telling me why they're not going to get the vaccine because they're seeing this these
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:54.120]  patients that their cancers were in remission then you know all of a sudden boom you know they're
[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:59.720]  blossoming again dr. Ursa quickly yeah i've got a question i don't want to dr. colter address um
[1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:06.840]  ryan you know that um the experimental data on the genome in p53 in brocco can you explain that
[1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:12.360]  to everyone yeah real quick so we have genes in our body we have mechanisms in our body we have
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:18.840]  bad cells in our body every day our body says oh i can kill that knock it off you know shakes hands
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:23.960]  with every cells you're gone you're gone you're a bad cell there are genes there are suppressor
[1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:30.440]  genes p53 it's the guardian of our genome there's another breast cancer gene brocco gene we know
[1:39:30.440 --> 1:39:39.080]  that the spike protein binds to the receptors for these genes and can activate them that is a
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:46.680]  mechanism of the spike protein so putting this spike protein in the human body via a gene shot
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:52.600]  that is completely investigational these are not approved and to mandate something that's
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:59.160]  investigational that can bind to cancer promoting sites i'd like to just yeah clarify and take that
[1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:05.640]  a step forward because p what p53 does is it checks your dna before it replicates and it makes
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:13.080]  sure that it's fixed so p53 is the one tumor suppressor gene that is most um tied to cancer
[1:40:13.080 --> 1:40:19.000]  because once there's a mutation in p53 the mutation rate just skyrockets correct and you're
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:23.640]  going to develop enough mutations that that cancer is going to have a much more likelihood of becoming
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:29.800]  metastatic absolutely so p53 is the essential tumor suppressor now do we know for sure that
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:36.120]  the spike protein is binding it and inactivating it so that it cannot make sure that your dna is
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:43.160]  replicated effectively and and without any errors no but that's why we should have tested these
[1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:48.280]  for cancer causing potential before we started giving them to our kids there's some confirmatory
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:54.760]  and can i can i yeah i'll put it into the record uh paper by jung in may yes where that goes into
[1:40:54.760 --> 1:41:02.200]  this data first of you spike compares dna damage repair thank you the key one of the key points
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:06.520]  is is we still don't officially know what the structure of these of these so-called vaccines
[1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:12.840]  are i mean we we do have some information now that's been published by a noble laureate group
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:18.440]  from stanford looking at the sequence from discards and and comparing it with uh with with the with
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:23.400]  the patents and and and there are what are called untranslated regions has anyone ever heard of this
[1:41:23.400 --> 1:41:31.720]  word untranslated region anyone yes a few people okay everyone has been told that the rna in there
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:35.480]  is just rna that's making this spike protein that's going to make your nice little cute little
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:40.280]  vaccine just like those mumps and polio vaccines that we've all had as a child has children no
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:44.520]  wrong there are untranslated regions and i'm going to read you what they are there's there's
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:50.680]  there's there are three human gene sequences in those untranslated regions one of them we think
[1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:55.640]  i'm working with a group of molecular biologists and genomics one of them we think is targeting the
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:42:01.400]  mitochondria i'll tell you what that gene sequence is it is a whereas it the three prime
[1:42:02.280 --> 1:42:06.520]  untranslated region comprises two sequence elements derived from the amino terminal
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:13.560]  enhanced of split asm rna and the mitochondrial encoded 12 is ribosomal rna to confirm rna
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:19.160]  stability and high total protein expression that's what that's what that's what a who document says
[1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:24.840]  now if that's true if that's true that that could mean we don't know we need to find out that could
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:30.840]  mean that the expression of the spike protein is actually being expressed partly at least in ribosomal
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:36.280]  in mitochondria ribosomes this is so wrong right right mitochondria right no no no yeah that means
[1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:41.400]  that means it could be a kami cars expression you know dr wiser listen you're certainly letting
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:44.920]  us know you're qualified that i don't know what you're talking about but but well what i'm talking
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:50.920]  about is what i'm talking about senator is in every single drug in packaging insert you see a
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:55.320]  chemical structure don't do you not there is a chemical structure we need to know the exact
[1:42:55.320 --> 1:43:02.520]  chemical structure the powerful combination of both vitamin c and zinc are great stepping stones

[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:22.440]  structure don't do you not there is a chemical structure we need to know the exact chemical
[1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:27.560]  structure the exact sequence of the rna's and the dna's in these vaccines okay they are being
[1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:33.000]  withheld from us fda needs to show us what those structures are it needs to explain what the pseudo
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:38.680]  urodine is doing you need they need to explain this paper from sahin who is the who is the
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:46.520]  finder of biointech in not in two thousand and uh 19 not two excuse me 2014 they talk about
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:51.720]  non-natural nuclear size what are those non-natural nuclear size doing he talks about the toxicity
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:57.480]  of them the pseudo urodine none of that is being discussed so none of that so i want to clarify
[1:47:57.480 --> 1:48:02.200]  a little bit there we need a lot more information i want to clarify because people said this is our
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:07.640]  mRNA vaccines mRNA only always goes to protein and we can't do anything first we know that people
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:11.960]  have reversed transcript days yes it can make dna yes it can go back into the dna but there's
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:19.560]  something else about rna rna can make little hairpin loops rna can regulate your dna so when
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:26.120]  you put an m rna vaccine or rna into your body it can get in and it can be alternately spliced
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:31.160]  confined to your dna and it can regulate it for positive or for negative it can change
[1:48:31.160 --> 1:48:35.000]  your gene expression and there's stuff in there that can do that either intentionally
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:40.120]  or unintentionally and we don't know it's completely unethical because we are just beginning to
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:45.960]  understand m r rna silencing where these rna molecules regulate our dna so that makes it
[1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:52.200]  completely unethical to use this technology we have to get on to there are great unknowns with
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:58.760]  respect to the vaccines their mechanism of action and disease categories like cancer
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:06.360]  but there is a disease category upon which the fda the cdc and all stakeholders agree
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:12.440]  that the vaccines cause and that's myocarditis or heart inflammation now i will tell you as a
[1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:21.080]  cardiologist it is crystal clear that these vaccines cause myocarditis dr park says already
[1:49:21.080 --> 1:49:27.640]  quoted the paper by avolio that is shown beyond the shadow of adopt the vaccines cause myocarditis
[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:34.680]  the fda indicates for physo modernet that they cause myocarditis we now have over 200 papers in
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:40.440]  the peer reviewed literature on myocarditis sadly showing the rates of myocarditis are far in
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:47.560]  excess of what the cdc ever imagined we've identified that boys are have a predilection for
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:53.640]  this far more than girls the maximum age group the peak age group is age 18 to 18 to 24 so it's
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:50:02.200]  actually the college age the risk extends up to age 50 and i can tell you that in this age group
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:09.560]  it is clear the risks of the vaccines are far greater than the risks of covet 19 the respiratory
[1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:15.720]  illness two papers one by tracy hoge at uc davis one by ron costoff that these papers have been
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:22.840]  presented at the fda meetings they have not been challenged as analyses one and there are now
[1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:29.720]  fatal cases of myocarditis published by washington university in st louis by verma and by choy from
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:36.520]  south korea more fatal cases accrue there is uh the father of a boy here in this room who's died
[1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:48.840]  of myocarditis one death is too many one one we have 21 000 cases of myocarditis and climbing
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:58.360]  in the united states that the cdc is verified one was too many under no circumstances under any
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:06.440]  circumstances should a young person ever receive one of these vaccines let alone ever be pressured
[1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:15.400]  to receive a vaccine let alone ever be mandated to take a vaccine this is crystal clear the fda
[1:51:15.400 --> 1:51:24.120]  agrees there can be no controversy over this there can be no normalizing of this to say that
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:30.120]  it's mild or it's transitory don't talk about that because they say it's mild talk is myocarditis
[1:51:30.120 --> 1:51:37.320]  mild my i'm telling you as a specialist myocarditis is not mild there are papers by shower
[1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:43.480]  and by now by trong at your sea of uh utah salt lake when they do mri on these individuals with
[1:51:43.480 --> 1:51:50.440]  suspected myocarditis 100 percent are having heart damage 100 percent we have a paper by tishope
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:56.520]  and collie's looking at the outcome of individuals prior to covet in this age group with myocarditis
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:52:04.280]  13 percent will have permanent heart injury 32 percent never actually get up to normal
[1:52:04.280 --> 1:52:10.600]  they don't get back to normal we are seeing unprecedented numbers of athletes dying on
[1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:16.760]  the field in europe unprecedented of these cardiac arrests half of them don't come back
[1:52:16.760 --> 1:52:22.440]  we now have a report out of the heart group in the uk where actuarial mortality for those
[1:52:22.440 --> 1:52:31.240]  under age 15 mortality in the uk is higher than expected which dr malone just real quick going
[1:52:31.240 --> 1:52:35.320]  back mr rance i wonder if dr malone could follow up on that just real quick because we're talking
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:42.360]  about myocarditis what concerns me so much about the whistleblower report there is this is the only
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:49.480]  vaccine injury that the cdc fda are acknowledging and you combine that with the fact that there's
[1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:54.920]  at least suspicions that the defense department is doctoring with the data in their database
[1:52:55.720 --> 1:53:03.480]  affecting myocarditis i mean i'm sorry that just that gets my suspicion antenna and the and the
[1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:11.640]  recommendations and the mandates are ignoring the fda warnings i would i would contend senator
[1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:17.640]  that there's not just a suspicion in august when the report was run on acute myocarditis
[1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:26.680]  in the dod website there were 1239 cases and now when you run it it's down to 307 in january of 2022
[1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:33.960]  there were 176 cases and magically they are now down to 17 there is a word for that it's not
[1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:41.160]  suspicious we have in the military the single best data set we that exists because we have
[1:53:41.160 --> 1:53:48.680]  baselines in there and acute disease across all categories in the preceding years five years leading
[1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:55.880]  up to the vaccination year was 1.7 million they introduced and mandated a covet 19 vaccine
[1:53:55.880 --> 1:54:01.160]  for our us military when they had only lost 12 service members total to the disease and in the
[1:54:01.160 --> 1:54:09.000]  10 months of 2021 after that it jumped from 1.7 million all diseases to darn near 22 million
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:16.200]  that was a 20 million increase we need to not be calling this suspicious with all due respect
[1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:21.320]  we need to be asking hard questions of the dod and i will close by saying they are charged at least
[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:27.400]  in part with protecting the sanctity and welfare of the brave men and women who are defending this
[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:32.440]  country and right now these numbers indicate something is drastically wrong and i know of
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:38.040]  only one reason that databases roll math backward who are you identify so sorry my name is lee
[1:54:38.040 --> 1:54:41.640]  dentus i'm a human rights attorney that's working with tom rance on the whistleblower issue in the
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:47.720]  military i would ask that congress listen to these whistleblowers put their testimony on record these
[1:54:47.720 --> 1:54:54.040]  are brave men and women a very high rank in the u.s military because not just do we congress in this
[1:54:54.040 --> 1:55:05.560]  building need to hear about it the world needs to hear about what is going on whether they were
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:10.840]  present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy
[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:19.560]  corrections we will follow the facts wherever they lead domestic terrorists the days of independent
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:25.400]  media are numbered the government has made it illegal to oppose them they are now defanking us
[1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:31.720]  behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly we practically have the
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:37.960]  population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps the traders know they can shut us down by
[1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:45.160]  force but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially so be it make them silence us by
[1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:53.880]  force this is the final battle of the information war give now buy products donate before everything
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:56:01.640]  changes we need you to carry us through to the end victory or death go now to info or store dot com
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:09.240]  thanks to you kids we now know the virus is a hoax they included flu pneumonia and other
[1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:14.200]  infections to boost the numbers let's find out who is really behind it all like president trump is
[1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:24.920]  definitely behind one of these phantoms she's pink dr. Fauci like i thought doctors were supposed
[1:56:24.920 --> 1:56:33.240]  to help people not scare them microsoft's bill gates not only a computer guy he's a notorious vaccine
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:39.400]  pusher who wants to reduce the world's population i get it so bill gates wanted to vaccinate everyone
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:44.440]  after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak that's diabolical yeah that
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:50.280]  sounds pretty bad don't worry kids these globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:55.320]  where they're going they'll be locked up for a long good while in the big house yeah
[1:56:57.160 --> 1:56:58.680]  better than a rock round at home
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:12.520]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:17.160]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[1:57:17.160 --> 1:57:31.000]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:53.160]  a riotous mob whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:59.240]  for the assault on our democracy insurrections we will follow the facts wherever they lead
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:05.960]  domestic terrorists the days of independent media are numbered the government has made it
[1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:12.200]  illegal to oppose them they are now deep banking us behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us and
[1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:18.520]  make us go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated
[1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:24.120]  up in camps the traders know they can shut us down by force but that would accelerate the
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:31.400]  awakening exponentially so be it make them silence us by force this is the final battle
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:39.800]  of the information war give now buy products donate before everything changes we need you
[1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:45.640]  to carry us through to the end victory or death go down to infowarstore.com

[2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:10.520]  you know i know we all grew up hearing about how imminent war with russia was about to happen
[2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:14.760]  but now it really could happen at least ranna hands a great investigative journalist who's
[2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:18.360]  really been one of the most accurate people out there with what's happening for years
[2:00:19.400 --> 2:00:25.880]  and so he's going to be joining us coming up in the next segment separately here
[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:33.720]  a lot of listeners have called into the show and people on the street have said to me hey you were
[2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:41.720]  really promoting reset wars for about a month and then you stop promoting it why aren't you
[2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:47.080]  promoting it we love it we think it's great got great reviews and the truth i'm really
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:50.360]  into reset wars and i think it's amazing and some of the most important work i've ever done
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:59.560]  but i have gotten so pinned down with building infrastructure in case they try to shut this
[2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:06.840]  operation down to stay on air and you know what happened with my wife and that chemical
[2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:13.240]  imbalance situation and a lot of family issues so the fact that i've not been talking about
[2:01:13.240 --> 2:01:20.920]  reset wars has absolutely nothing to do with me not liking it or thinking it's the best thing
[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:28.360]  i've ever done in fact it's the contrary it's so important it's so game changing that i just see
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:38.600]  everything we covered in it really manifesting right now and and i feel like i'm not giving it
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:46.200]  justice so i've been resetting to promote reset wars again and i've been really looking at all
[2:01:46.200 --> 2:01:50.520]  the things elon musk has been saying all the things that are happening and all this discussion of
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:58.680]  mind viruses and so much more and getting ready to do the first teleconference that i'm gonna
[2:01:58.680 --> 2:02:03.640]  start doing every month it's time to do that very soon we'll do it very soon with people that are
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:09.480]  members of it and we're gonna be launching a whole new show around it and so much more you
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:15.080]  know people kind of got a prelude to this this saturday we did a live show for two hours and
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:20.920]  took a lot of calls a lot of amazing people on the ground in canada i'm intending to
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:28.520]  because i enjoy no commercials no breaks just two three hours of calls and special guests
[2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:35.560]  and so i'm gonna be doing that not just once a month but i think at least every couple weeks
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:40.760]  for folks that are reset wars members and then i'm also going to be doing two or three nights a week
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:46.760]  a live event where i take calls but i'm gonna be in a bonfire in somebody's backyard or i'm gonna
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:53.480]  be you know on top of building or i'm gonna be somewhere else we're gonna be outside doing things
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:57.080]  because i love being here in the studio and you know it's interesting and the crew is great but
[2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:01.720]  when you're on top of mountain or on top of building or out in the woods somewhere around a
[2:03:01.720 --> 2:03:08.760]  campfire with the live feed going that makes it so much more real and really gets me into another
[2:03:08.760 --> 2:03:14.680]  place where just a lot of more interesting informative things come out than just what we
[2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:20.280]  cover here on air so we have a lot of new things we're getting ready to launch i'm a couple months
[2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:26.200]  behind because of congressional subpoenas and family issues and you're all dealing with it too the
[2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:31.640]  world's just crazy right now but we are on course do a lot of things while separately working with
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:39.240]  a lot of other people to make sure that major backup infrastructure is built to keep this show on the
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:49.160]  air and to keep other broadcasts on the air and boy to CNN get the intel because nobody watches them
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:54.040]  but you got to watch him to hear what the enemy's doing i mean literally they're like yeah if we
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:59.960]  take Joe Rogan off the air he'll just go do his own show somewhere bigger yeah you dumb bastards
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:09.080]  but you got to build the server farms you got to put the infrastructure in in other countries
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:16.840]  it takes money to fight big tech it takes money to fight the globalist and that's what we're doing
[2:04:17.720 --> 2:04:22.200]  so i'm not going to give it all the way to everybody but obviously as i've told you
[2:04:23.800 --> 2:04:27.880]  80 percent of what i do is right here on the service and this and these broadcasts and my
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:32.680]  reporters and what we we've changed the world together but that other 20 percent is all
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:39.240]  about having a huge effect in the future if they attempt to shut us down or take us down
[2:04:39.960 --> 2:04:46.040]  so thank you all for your support your blessings and sharing all our articles and videos stay with

[2:06:12.440 --> 2:06:21.480]  trudeau that says he admires dictatorship and zeezy ping has come out and said that the truckers the
[2:06:21.480 --> 2:06:28.040]  hundreds of thousands of people in the capital protesting are violent hateful people and should
[2:06:28.040 --> 2:06:35.560]  not be allowed to have their views this is what a authoritarian corporate minion looks like this
[2:06:35.560 --> 2:06:41.160]  is truly disgusting now leah strana hands an investigative journalist of many many years
[2:06:41.160 --> 2:06:47.400]  has worked for bright bark he's worked for a lot of other leptis publications you name it like the
[2:06:47.400 --> 2:06:51.880]  huffington post and i've been having him on for eight nine years now but i remember he would
[2:06:51.880 --> 2:06:57.400]  just harp on ukraine and harp on what was happening there and how it was where the globalists
[2:06:57.400 --> 2:07:01.960]  laundered their money and all the rest of it and russia gate and now he's really been vindicated
[2:07:01.960 --> 2:07:07.400]  and so we see the headlines about imminent war with russia and ukraine goes actually russia's
[2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:14.200]  not about to invade and we see western troops massing in poland in other areas what is really
[2:07:14.200 --> 2:07:19.960]  going on from all his research and all his sources because this is a big deal it already
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:27.480]  crashed the stock market several thousand points last week on fears of this is biden just using
[2:07:28.040 --> 2:07:32.120]  this is a political distraction uh leah strana hand thank you so much for joining us
[2:07:33.640 --> 2:07:37.640]  alice great to be with you thanks a lot for having me on again you bet on your website i should
[2:07:37.640 --> 2:07:44.120]  add a citizen journalism school dot com citizen journalism school dot com so give us a 35 000 foot
[2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:50.040]  view if you can then let's zoom in on what's happening well first off alex you'll you'll
[2:07:50.040 --> 2:07:57.000]  be able to appreciate this and your audience will because you know history people need to
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:02.120]  understand that what we're seeing play out right now is part of something that's been going on
[2:08:02.120 --> 2:08:10.040]  since around the end of world war two since the end of world war two when the cia was set up in 1948
[2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:17.160]  right when the cia began their operations one of the early operations they did involved ukraine
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:23.400]  and don't take my word for it anyone can go to the cia just type go to any search engine type in
[2:08:23.400 --> 2:08:34.360]  cia foya archives and you'll find the cia's own website and type in lebed that's from a kolo lebed
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:41.240]  lebed was a war criminal he was a nazi collaborator and the cia knows that and it's right in their
[2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:49.640]  own files and you know he was a nazi collaborator from ukraine who's with the 14th waffen ss which
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:56.040]  is the ukrainian nazi group and he was working with the cia do you know where this guy died
[2:08:56.040 --> 2:09:03.080]  he's a war criminal he he lived and died in pittsburgh pennsylvania alex and anyone can look it up
[2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:11.960]  it's very clear now this background of the cia working with and really using ukraine using
[2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:19.560]  the worst elements the literal nazi collaborators continued on for decades he set up a company
[2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:25.960]  called prologue which was doing propaganda this was operation error dynamic by the way the left
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:30.680]  sold access to nazis what you're saying is totally true the nazis took over ukraine and they had
[2:09:30.680 --> 2:09:36.440]  stayed behind networks after world war two where basically the nazis kind of continued on there
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:41.320]  and and that's the new fisher basically that we see going on in ukraine i mean we saw the main
[2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:47.000]  opposition party and then the people party got into power hailing hitler uh in the last few years
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:54.120]  and and right now what's happening in eastern ukraine in the region is called the donbas the
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:10:02.520]  eastern part of ukraine is you've got militias like a group called the azoff battalion azof battalion
[2:10:03.240 --> 2:10:11.000]  or right sector now these guys are neo nazis and they're not even hiding it they're very clear
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:16.440]  about it and they're supported by the biden administration also and it makes perfect sense
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:21.720]  when you look at the history because again the cia has been supporting us now what they were doing
[2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:29.480]  was the cia in the 50s 60s and 70s was ginning up because what the cia was saying is they were
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:37.720]  anti-communist but really that translated to anti-russian and they played up the ethnic hatred
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:45.080]  of russians in ukraine that's what prologue was doing and look you know you you and i are not big
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:53.960]  fans of communism at all and i didn't like so the the soviet union ussr at all but when the cia doesn't
[2:10:53.960 --> 2:11:01.560]  like communism dates still like authoritarian i'm sure the reason is want to ask you why do you
[2:11:01.560 --> 2:11:06.760]  oppose communism alex it's ultimately they're authoritarian right that's a problem yes but
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:13.800]  the cia is pro-authoritarian but anti-communist does it make sense at least they were in the past
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:17.640]  exactly so it's a proxy war it's heating up you're giving us some background history that's
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:23.720]  always important uh people don't know that russia was literally born i guess 900 years ago out of
[2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:32.280]  ukraine and then there was the uh a hunt invasion and then they were occupied 200 years and moscow
[2:11:32.280 --> 2:11:38.520]  rose up overthrew it and then went and saved ukraine and so the the very birthplace of russia
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:44.760]  is ukraine that's mainline history for folks that don't know why is russia upset why is russia
[2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:49.640]  bringing in troops on the border let's let's fast forward to what's currently happening so what's
[2:11:49.640 --> 2:11:54.760]  currently happening is that narrative you just think about this alex think about for just one
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:12:01.800]  second why would anybody suppose that the media that lies about everything you can't name an
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:07.400]  issue they're honest about would get this one right right there's no reason so when they're
[2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:14.040]  reporting since november that russia is about to invade russia syria lavrov who's the foreign
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:19.800]  minister putin they've been very clear they're not about to invade and in his phone call that
[2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:26.280]  happened last thursday the head of ukraine said to biden zolinsky this former netflix comedian
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:32.360]  who's now the president of ukraine he said to biden we don't think russia is about to invade
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:36.440]  so let me be clear by the way i'll let you start the interview with that how big is it the west
[2:12:36.440 --> 2:12:41.000]  own puppet says the russians aren't invading stop it you have the live or off the foreign
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.880]  minister saying we're not doing it and biden responds with brace for imminent attack what the
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:51.880]  hell's going on here well alex how many times have you heard there's 100 000 troops on the border
[2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:58.600]  of ukraine a zillion times right that's the narrative the troops have been in a place called
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:06.840]  yelnia yelnia yel and y a anyone can look it up it's about 120 miles from the border it's not
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:13.880]  right on the border this is a town where they have troops right yeah but i'm not even the west is
[2:13:13.880 --> 2:13:19.960]  massing troops russia will be insane to not put troops on their border but but they don't they're
[2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:26.920]  they're in yelnia is closer to moscow than it is to Kiev by a lot it's not close to the border
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:32.840]  so i just want to point out the whole narrative since november has been a fake one saying that
[2:13:32.840 --> 2:13:37.720]  there's they're acting like there's a hundred thousand troops ready you know right next to
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:41.960]  strana hand listen i i know the audience knows some of this i know some of it and i get your
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:47.080]  giving us good historical background but bottom line do you think war is about to kick off what
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:52.840]  is the big reason biden's doing this what the hell's going on here well first off it's part of the
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:58.360]  u.s policy that i talked about before historically so it's a through line it's what they're doing
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:04.920]  is they're sending money and support and the cia is involved right now this is why brenton cia
[2:14:05.560 --> 2:14:12.440]  in in the fifties right now the cia is supporting the neo-nazis in eastern yeah they are they're
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:18.040]  supplying billions of of of javelin missiles and and and everything it's insane right now
[2:14:18.040 --> 2:14:26.920]  now and and the only thing russia cares about at all is that there's ethnic cleansing of ethnic
[2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:32.760]  russians in that eastern region going on but there's no there's no western ukrainians have
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:38.280]  pushed nato back military in they're pushing a lot of their farms or businesses and the russians
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:43.320]  which have been there forever uh for the only 900 years folks that just showed up yesterday
[2:14:43.320 --> 2:14:48.360]  they're not liking what's happening because again the west wants a provocation with russia
[2:14:48.360 --> 2:14:54.920]  so they're persecuting uh uh ethnic russians to get a fight and what putin brought up and
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:15:00.920]  labroth brought up in his talks is don't forget what happened in 2014 under the obama administration
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:06.760]  under the obama biden administration that was when the euro madon happened in where we took
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:12.440]  a democratically elected government the governor viktor yanukovic that was elected no one questions
[2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:17.880]  that that was elected certified and everything else and we overthrew that government and put
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:23.800]  in a puppet government that's what the u.s did and and soros was behind it he's got a group called
[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:29.400]  international uh soros went on for reads our karya six years ago and sprag he overthrew it
[2:15:30.840 --> 2:15:37.880]  and i'll tell you what else he said he said the nazis were in eastern ukraine because of russia
[2:15:37.880 --> 2:15:43.240]  which is a complete fabrication they were in western ukraine galaxy that's where they were
[2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:48.680]  so that oh yeah obviously the western ukraine was nazi in world war two yeah and he was working
[2:15:48.680 --> 2:15:54.120]  for hitler you can't make hold on at least at least stay there stay there i want to come back
[2:15:54.120 --> 2:15:59.880]  though you always love to do background stuff with all the craziness going on in the world
[2:16:00.440 --> 2:16:05.400]  with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown or the next phase of the great reset
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:10.600]  being a stage cyber attack with the deep state pushing a civil war not just here
[2:16:11.320 --> 2:16:17.080]  but in europe and war with russia with the massive inflation and all the other garbage
[2:16:17.080 --> 2:16:22.120]  that's taking place like supply chain right now's you need to get prepared now with high
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:28.840]  quality storable food that is ready to ship and it's been four years since my patriot supply
[2:16:28.840 --> 2:16:37.640]  at preparewithalex.com has offered their storable food at 25 off four years but right now it's 25
[2:16:37.640 --> 2:16:43.720]  percent off until february 13th 2022 a little over two weeks from the time i'm cutting this
[2:16:43.720 --> 2:16:51.480]  to get 25 off at preparewithalex.com on the entire catalog of my patriot supply act now
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:56.200]  get prepared now this is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient
[2:16:56.200 --> 2:17:01.640]  why do my enemies hate me so much why do the globalists take you so much why do they hate
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:09.720]  america so much because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing
[2:17:09.720 --> 2:17:15.240]  cannot coexist with it's very very simple for their world government their anti-human
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:21.960]  post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and due process injustice and god

[2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:46.200]  attacks until they have the fear of god put into them the average person still doesn't even know
[2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:51.080]  about the new world order or about globalism or about corporate fascism and it's not until

[2:19:15.400 --> 2:19:20.760]  you're an unstoppable tank supermail volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:27.240]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[2:19:27.240 --> 2:19:32.280]  powdered versions they also work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:36.440]  it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:40.200]  okay people like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong
[2:19:40.200 --> 2:19:45.720]  that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like
[2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:50.440]  super strong but yeah if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price then this is it
[2:19:50.440 --> 2:20:04.040]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:20:11.240 --> 2:20:14.600]  all right welcome back to alex jones show at least ran a hand investigative journalist
[2:20:14.600 --> 2:20:19.000]  shrouded shotgun with us he really is a ukrain expert and i get you're giving us the background
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:22.840]  the history world war two it's been part of russia at least the eastern part
[2:20:24.440 --> 2:20:28.440]  what do you make of why biden's doing this now why they're having press conferences
[2:20:28.440 --> 2:20:33.400]  about imminent war with russia and russia's like no we're not getting today this is made up
[2:20:33.400 --> 2:20:38.920]  now even ukraine comes out and says it's not true please stop you're crashing our economy
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:45.960]  what is really going on here what's really going on is biden wants to get rid of latimer
[2:20:45.960 --> 2:20:52.360]  putin because biden has been sponsored by a russia oligarch that no one ever talks about
[2:20:52.360 --> 2:20:56.520]  and when i talk about this history stuff you know let me just plug the dvds you're just
[2:20:56.520 --> 2:21:02.040]  plugging in the commercial break there you alex have been talking about stuff like skull and bones
[2:21:02.040 --> 2:21:08.920]  and the background carol quigley stuff like that forever and understanding the history has helped me
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:16.920]  understand today you know i mean every time i learn history i go well this explains the inexplicable
[2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:23.640]  and that's what's happening here biden first off is following us policy us policy has been
[2:21:23.640 --> 2:21:31.160]  to support the nazis in ukraine for decades but also this is guy kortikovsky senate resolution
[2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:39.240]  you'll like this 322 is that ring a bell senate resolution 322 from 2005 easy number remember
[2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:46.680]  anyone can look that up that's a russian oligarch michael kortikovsky sponsored by one guy joe biden
[2:21:46.680 --> 2:21:54.120]  was the sole sponsor and there are only two co-sponsors obama and biden so what is putting
[2:21:54.120 --> 2:21:59.160]  pressure on russia claiming they're going to invade about killing the Nord Stream 2 it's
[2:21:59.160 --> 2:22:04.120]  partially about that but it's mainly really they want to get rid of putin and that's because
[2:22:04.120 --> 2:22:09.400]  this guy kortikovsky was put in jail by putin sure but don't they get messing with putin like
[2:22:09.400 --> 2:22:15.960]  this only makes it more popular well it does it doesn't hurt his popularity i'll say that
[2:22:15.960 --> 2:22:20.760]  but this is why they keep doing it this is why i've been saying for years the real target in
[2:22:20.760 --> 2:22:26.360]  russia gate wasn't trump it was actually putin and it's hard for people to get it because
[2:22:26.360 --> 2:22:32.440]  trump obviously was a target but the main target this goes back to this thing the Magnitsky Act
[2:22:32.440 --> 2:22:39.160]  from 2012 that was sponsored by this guy kortikovsky anyone look up senate resolution 322 and tell me
[2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:45.720]  why no one's ever done a story about it there's no stories out there so obviously the left ones
[2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:49.880]  control of russia they got to rape and murder and kill for 80 years as their private hollywood
[2:22:49.880 --> 2:22:54.520]  murdered around when the left of america and the uk took control of it as their kill christian
[2:22:54.520 --> 2:22:59.720]  playground right that's the truth but where is it going now and how do you expect putin to respond
[2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:05.160]  where do you see this going because we've got the president who's a puppet saying war is imminent
[2:23:05.160 --> 2:23:10.120]  obviously that's not true or is the west getting ready to stage a false flag which they claim putin's
[2:23:10.120 --> 2:23:16.840]  about to do on wednesday if you'd ask me i would have thought this was headed towards war ironically
[2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:23.400]  this guy zelinski by publicly don't forget they leaked that phone call yeah how big is it that the
[2:23:23.400 --> 2:23:30.520]  president of ukraine who's a puppet doesn't want war he because he knows his book it's bs that's huge
[2:23:30.520 --> 2:23:34.360]  it's gigantic but i'll tell you where it's going and i'll tell you where to get the clue
[2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:41.480]  oddly saturday night live if you which knew you didn't because no one does not so it was a cold
[2:23:41.480 --> 2:23:49.240]  open where they made jokes about russia for for ten minutes well what they did was they're trying
[2:23:49.240 --> 2:23:55.880]  to set up that the only reason ukraine would be doing this is that they were tricked by russian
[2:23:55.880 --> 2:24:01.320]  disinformation so what they're setting up you watch the narrative is going to be that the
[2:24:01.320 --> 2:24:07.960]  head of ukraine was tricked by russia instead of the guy who's the head of ukraine yeah they're
[2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:16.360]  now saying the truckers protesting lockdowns are russians agents mm-hmm that's right the russia
[2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:23.160]  is and and again once you see the pattern it's very clear what they do they do everything you
[2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:31.080]  don't like there's two things it's racist and it's russian it's both of those and it's what's odd is
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:37.560]  of course they the the nazi pastor the ukraine is what we're defending so the democrats and
[2:24:37.560 --> 2:24:44.760]  sadly most republicans no one wants to actually look at the situation and go maybe putin selling
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:51.000]  the truth and he has no intention of invading ukraine and i don't think he has any intention
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:55.640]  of invading ukraine and i don't think the u.s is going to be able to push it but i'll tell you
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:01.800]  where this is going ultimately they're not going to drop this until putin leaves foward because
[2:25:01.800 --> 2:25:07.080]  they don't want him in there this is guy kortakovsky mentioned he really doesn't want putin in there
[2:25:07.080 --> 2:25:12.920]  anybody can look him up and see he says he wants to get rid of putin because he wants revenge
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:18.840]  for putin putting his guy in jail and putin pardoned him which i think was mistake on putin's part
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:27.720]  but everybody this this russia's hate stuff not russia gate russia hate is not going anywhere
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:35.000]  anytime soon and the republicans should come out and say look why are we defending nazis in
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:41.240]  ukraine that's what they should be doing why are we defending an obama overthrow an obama
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:48.120]  well sure but i mean lee the average american like 70 plus percent almost 80 percent don't want any
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:53.560]  conflict with russia i saw another poll like 15 one conflict so you you talk about i think
[2:25:53.560 --> 2:25:58.600]  americans get that it's the left opening our borders it's the left bankrupting our dollar it's the
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:04.680]  left teaching drag queen story time i don't think anybody is buying this this delusional
[2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:10.600]  uh... you know russia gate garbage anymore well i don't think you know what's happening is
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:19.720]  the grassroots people i've noticed that but in government you can't find really almost anybody
[2:26:19.720 --> 2:26:25.000]  who doesn't take the establishment line in the republican party right now on russia
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:31.160]  republican senators saying preemptively nuke russia like the manly thing to do is talk about nuclear war
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:39.800]  i mean right no it's crazy and that that's crazy and even the people who are brave enough to
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:47.160]  question this at all thomas massie a few people like that bowler right but they're getting attacked as
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:55.640]  putin sink events now which by the way i again i agree with you the grassroots people get it
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:27:02.280]  and they've heard what you know who's said stuff criticizing woke culture is vladimir putin
[2:27:02.840 --> 2:27:08.040]  he said he's come out against that he's one of those guys where if you look into what he says
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:14.360]  what he actually says a lot of people would like him i think even more and go oh i see why they're
[2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:21.800]  demonizing this guy he's he's a christian he's an avowed christian who you know believes things
[2:27:21.800 --> 2:27:27.880]  is pro-family very pro-family folks understand that's what i'm asking is where do you see this all
[2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:32.360]  ending because they really hyped up war with russia and then it's imminent and then it looks like
[2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:39.320]  none of it's true and none of it is true and because of what zealinski did not only had the phone
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:44.360]  call and told biden to back off but also leaked the phone call here's where i think it's going
[2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:50.360]  i think the us is going to try to they brought in this guy the this puppet has reported shanko
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:55.640]  he was the guy who helped gin up the stuff against trump during the last election
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:28:02.040]  poor shanko they recently brought him back to ukraine so you watch to see if they try to get
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:07.000]  rid of zealinski and get the puppet poor shanko back in there they're going to try to get rid
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:13.080]  of zealinski they're going to slam him they're going to say he was fooled by russian disinfo
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:18.520]  they're already calling zealinski a tool of putin already they're playing that card
[2:28:18.520 --> 2:28:23.640]  meanwhile communist china has totally infiltrated everything and there's still no discussion of
[2:28:23.640 --> 2:28:29.560]  that yeah and by the way there are common there's a communist party in russia and i'll tell you
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:37.240]  who they don't like ladmer putin one bit and and even ted cruz ted can do some good stuff but he
[2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:43.720]  came out a few months ago and said ladmer putin's a communist well he's not period i understand
[2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:49.000]  that let's do one more segment lee i want to ask you about other political issues and and what
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:53.800]  this signifies that biden so desperate trying to start this russian war what what is that really

[2:32:08.600 --> 2:32:14.280]  n and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that once they've gotten you with that
[2:32:14.280 --> 2:32:20.200]  system then they're gonna carbon attach you everywhere you go and track what you do and
[2:32:20.200 --> 2:32:25.560]  publicly they're saying they're gonna decide when you can travel and when you can't travel and master

[2:32:55.720 --> 2:33:19.960]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:19.960 --> 2:33:32.200]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:33:32.200 --> 2:33:40.440]  so
[2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:48.360]  all right investigative journalists author researcher least randy hands our guests
[2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:52.840]  and i appreciate him joining us today and he's giving us some good backstory and
[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:58.200]  talk about the lies but i mean everybody i know knows that already my question is
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:34:05.080]  is what did biden and his controllers think they were doing saying there's an imminent attack
[2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:09.640]  saying brace for impact and then it doesn't happen crying wolf like that
[2:34:11.400 --> 2:34:16.760]  was it just a desperate distraction or just to see what they could do or to make america look like
[2:34:16.760 --> 2:34:22.760]  clowns because everything they do i think is to destroy america the biggest enemy of america
[2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:29.560]  are these leftists that are running the country yeah no i of course i agree with you on that alex
[2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:35.560]  i think they thought first off they were correct if they assumed that the media would have their
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:40.920]  back and the media would not question their narrative at all and just dutifully these
[2:34:40.920 --> 2:34:45.000]  stenographers for whatever they said you just hit the key i'm interrupting i'm going to start the
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:51.640]  show with that today the people running things still think only abc and nbc and cnn matter
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:34:57.800]  when everyone hates it exactly they keep delusionally acting like because the media is going to support
[2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:03.240]  it when the media endorses something people turn against it don't i told politico and ram paul got
[2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:09.240]  elected like six years ago they said what could we have done to beat him i said endorsing but see
[2:35:09.240 --> 2:35:16.200]  that's the they don't get that do they lee no they definitely don't and and but it when you know
[2:35:16.200 --> 2:35:21.640]  when they're strategizing when they're wargaming and stuff out they know that the new york times
[2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:27.400]  and the washington posts and so on are absolutely just going to dutifully report with headlines
[2:35:27.400 --> 2:35:32.280]  oh yeah there's troops on the border and what they got everybody to repeat is two phrases
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:38.040]  troops on the border and the other one which is i think the equivalent remember the phrase
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:46.760]  iraqi wmds yes the equivalent here is russian disinformation everybody talks about russian
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:53.080]  disinformation but you know what they can never do they can never point out one thing that russia's
[2:35:53.080 --> 2:35:57.560]  saying that's incorrect it's like they label anybody questioning their lives as a russian
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:36:03.000]  to make them an outsider when it's the globalists that are anti-freedom anti-country anti-america
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:10.280]  so they just literally project what they are on us and and and anti-free speech because they use
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:17.240]  russian disinformation disinformation as a smear to attack and and anything they don't like and
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:22.120]  that's why the snl thing i've been talking about this for a couple weeks the cold open as you
[2:36:22.120 --> 2:36:29.880]  mentioned was so funny that it was called russian disinformation that they're falling right into line
[2:36:29.880 --> 2:36:36.200]  this is a culture war on saturday night live playing out and they're setting up a narrative
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:42.040]  that you again you're gonna start to see play out so i think they thought they could get war going
[2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:48.200]  how could they have counted on zolinsky who's been a puppet this is a guy's former netflix yeah i can't
[2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:54.200]  i can't overstate how big it is the puppet globalist president comedian of ukraine came out and said
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:37:01.640]  it's not a war they're not invading stop it i mean he finally is finding his common sense there that's
[2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:07.720]  that's right and they i don't think they counted on that at all because thus far zolinsky has been
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:13.720]  a good little puppet for them but not only do you have that call this is really significant as you
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:23.800]  know that was leaked by ukraine so ukraine wanted the world to know how badly that call went and
[2:37:23.800 --> 2:37:30.360]  and you know what you know i mentioned the way the cia used ukraine they really did use ukraine
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:36.120]  because obviously not everyone in ukraine is a nazi right and the people getting killed in the
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:45.080]  eastern part of ukraine are ukrainians okay so this bs has gone on long enough but the
[2:37:45.080 --> 2:37:50.040]  biden administration and i'll tell you where it's happening we're at a very interesting time and you
[2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:56.520]  know it too with things like the joe rogan thing happening with this the freedom convoy that happened
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:38:02.920]  over the weekend one of the i saw russell brand talking about it and i like the sub russell brand
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:10.440]  saying a lot lately and russell brand talked about how creative that truck convoy was who would
[2:38:10.440 --> 2:38:18.360]  have thought let's do a truck convoy and that'll be huge right that's a creative idea and someone
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:23.960]  needs to get creative if they want to stop these warmongers they need to do it in a creative way
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:31.880]  because the warmongers know how propaganda works and they're and they can you again we know what
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:36.680]  they control even though no one watches we're aware of it and two can play at that game
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:44.040]  that's right and and that's what we're starting to see that that truck convoy was an example to me
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:51.480]  of citizen activism that worked and part of why it worked is as as russell brand had said over the
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:58.200]  weekend on a video applauding them he pointed out what a creative idea it was that was a creative
[2:38:58.200 --> 2:39:02.200]  idea which you know came out like a can response like they thought there would have already been
[2:39:02.200 --> 2:39:06.920]  violence and said oh they're violent oh they're bad they're not good and then they said these are
[2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:11.960]  russian agents this is the people not wanting to be locked down not wanting a gmo shot in them
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:16.120]  and here's the so-called leader that admits he wants a dictatorship and then is the minion
[2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:20.360]  of claus schwaab saying no you're not a canadian you're a russian here's the clip
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:32.920]  my friend urwin caughtler said on saturday freedom of expression assembly and association
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:42.360]  are cornerstones of democracy but nazi symbolism racist imagery and desecration of war memorials are
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:53.560]  not none of that is an insult to memory and truth hate can never be the answer over the past few
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:40:01.160]  days canadians were shocked and frankly disgusted oh yeah by the behavior displayed by some people
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:10.520]  protesting in our nation's capital i want to be very clear we are not intimidated by those who hurl
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:18.600]  insults and abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless oh we won't give in
[2:40:19.320 --> 2:40:29.000]  to those who fly racist flags we won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:33.720]  of our veterans so they're the ones shutting the economy down they're the ones bankrupting people

[2:44:05.400 --> 2:44:11.880]  would establish world government by releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide lock downs
[2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:17.240]  and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it how did i know
[2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:22.360]  they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and
[2:44:22.360 --> 2:44:27.720]  internal meetings were leaked you see then i was tracking the builder group who's head at the time
[2:44:27.720 --> 2:44:32.440]  was claus schwa and our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning
[2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:37.880]  launch this great recent well we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the third world

[2:47:54.360 --> 2:48:00.120]  few people and then you got the millions of folks about love and hope and justice and opening up
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:06.920]  their country it's incredible stop castro's little bastard yes dad said i love finnell castrow

[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:20.680]  these are monsters it's so unbelievable ladies and gentlemen but let me talk about this
[2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:26.120]  i launched reset wars a month and a half ago promoted for about three weeks it was very
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:30.440]  successful and it's really important work something special we haven't done on air
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:35.720]  because if you really research it and implement it it'll change your life it it's it's incredible
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:41.880]  but then i had family attacks and i had uh congressional subpoenas and i had a lot of other
[2:48:41.880 --> 2:48:47.800]  stuff that happened and so i got distracted and didn't promote it and and some listeners called
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:53.560]  into the shows uh the american journal in the morning and into owens and mines like why aren't
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:58.920]  you promoting reset wars i'm like because i can't give something this important justice while i'm
[2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:07.000]  off balance and also the company that do a lot of the great top self-help people you name it
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:12.920]  they never had this happen they took their bank account away they uh took the video streaming
[2:49:12.920 --> 2:49:17.560]  servers away so they had to scramble and that happened about two weeks ago so we were just
[2:49:17.560 --> 2:49:23.000]  busy even being able to offer you the course which is all about enlightenment and love
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:28.280]  and coming together and finding your true self they're scared of that ladies and gentlemen
[2:49:28.280 --> 2:49:33.880]  so i'm about to do another big push for reset wars and out of reset wars we want to establish an
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:39.960]  online university and almost all of it it's going to be free special reports kind of like
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:46.440]  my vision is what you saw with prager university like three four five minute little animated
[2:49:46.440 --> 2:49:50.680]  factoids that are so powerful that's what we want to do that takes money to build that money to do
[2:49:50.680 --> 2:49:55.640]  that it's not like i say support me i'm going to do something and i don't you've seen info wars
[2:49:55.640 --> 2:50:02.840]  deliver well under attack we're trying to do stuff way more powerful than anything we've ever done
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:13.160]  so if you go to reset wars dot com we're offering the course at 50% off that's the lowest we can go
[2:50:14.280 --> 2:50:20.040]  so that you get the course and so that you show your friends and family and so you spend the time
[2:50:20.040 --> 2:50:23.640]  and a lot of it you're already going to know some of it you're going to not but the point is
[2:50:23.640 --> 2:50:30.200]  it's seven hours of focused research and history mk ultra documents you name it using their own
[2:50:30.200 --> 2:50:36.600]  technologies that they've developed against them so i'm really proud of the film really proud of
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:43.320]  the two courses mind war spirit wars 50 off we're only running this for three days at reset wars
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:49.640]  dot com and i hope you'll be part of this because it's up it's ready they don't want you to have it
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:56.200]  they're trying to censor it they're so scared of it reset wars dot com reset wars dot com
[2:50:56.200 --> 2:51:01.560]  if you were waiting or on the fence support the info war it's a 360 win but this is really
[2:51:01.560 --> 2:51:06.280]  a powerful course the only way you fail is not taking action here are some of the testimonials
[2:51:06.280 --> 2:51:22.200]  you must understand the groups in control know that we are awakening
[2:51:26.280 --> 2:51:32.760]  they're playing create a society where everyone is controlled by a singular force or power against
[2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:38.920]  our free will in that way you're forced to follow their rules or else you're stripped of whatever
[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:45.000]  rights you still have they want you to think that you don't matter and that's exactly what
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:50.520]  these sick and twisted elites with the demonic agenda want you to think but if enough people make
[2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:57.640]  the decision that they can't fight back against corrupt powers in charge then without a doubt

[2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:58.360]  lockdown with the next phase of the great reset being a stage cyber attack with the deep state
[2:58:58.360 --> 2:59:05.560]  pushing a civil war not just here but in europe and war with russia with the massive inflation
[2:59:05.560 --> 2:59:11.400]  and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain right now you need to get prepared
[2:59:11.400 --> 2:59:17.640]  now with high quality storeable food that is ready to ship and it's been four years since my

[2:59:41.400 --> 2:59:46.120]  get prepared now this is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient
[2:59:46.120 --> 2:59:54.600]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:59:57.560 --> 3:00:04.520]  of thousands descend upon dc for a defeat that mandates medical freedom rally well most mainstream
[3:00:04.520 --> 3:00:10.280]  media ignored the event altogether some chose to misrepresent it bringing you what's ignored
[3:00:10.280 --> 3:00:14.920]  sensationalized unbalanced misleading or just plain falls here's your media malfeasance for
[3:00:14.920 --> 3:00:22.920]  the final week of january washington post leads with the sensational term anti-vaccine activists
[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:29.160]  never mind that it is in no way accurate in describing the rally a prominent vaccine developer
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:36.840]  was among the speakers and many have existively repeated that their pro vaccine just and mandate
[3:00:36.840 --> 3:00:44.280]  but who expects accuracy from legacy media other outlets zeroed in on less than two minutes of a
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:00:51.640]  20-minute speech given by robert f kennedy jr cnn misrepresented the point rfk jr was making about
[3:00:51.640 --> 3:00:57.960]  seeing the warning signs of authoritarian rule that inspired segregation discrimination and
[3:00:57.960 --> 3:01:05.880]  ultimately death leading up to the holocaust just the mere mention of an frank earns rfk jr the label
[3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:13.480]  anti-semite according to cnn but it was always okay to make hitler and nazi germany references
[3:01:13.480 --> 3:01:20.280]  when it was this guy at the helm so when people asked why you support donald trump you just tell
[3:01:20.280 --> 3:01:29.080]  them he's going to take our economy from here to here all the feigned outrage was to distract from
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:36.440]  the two and a half hours of other info packed testimonies preceding the rfk jr speech so what's
[3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:43.400]  an actual holocaust survivor have to say about totalitarian measures surrounding the jab mandates
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:53.320]  so my question is if these injections don't prevent infection or transmission why then are the
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:02:02.600]  vaccinated special they're allowed to do all kinds of they have all kinds of freedom which the
[3:02:02.600 --> 3:02:10.040]  government allows them from time to time right they still have to wear masks but the unvaccinated
[3:02:10.040 --> 3:02:20.760]  are being vilified as the jews were in the 1930s and 40s what's the difference also this week cbs
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:26.680]  actually asks a decent question of its panel who feels they are better off with biden than they
[3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:32.920]  were with trump but perhaps they didn't expect this response no one believes we're in a better
[3:02:32.920 --> 3:02:40.120]  spot now unfortunately i don't think that our public servants are actually they're kind of on
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:45.000]  a lag with the science i was not vax head cold but i didn't even know i had it i had the sniffles
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:50.040]  for two days and body aches and if i hadn't lost my sense of smell i wouldn't have known the difference
[3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:59.960]  turning now to someone who doesn't like questions yes president biden calls a reporter a stupid
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:06.680]  we're asking about inflation kelly o'donnell of nbc news plays cover it's on the subject of the
[3:03:06.680 --> 3:03:12.440]  event which was related to the economy so peter ducia fox asked about inflation and got that
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:18.280]  insulting response in front of a microphone and an audience so biden was upset the reporter wasn't
[3:03:18.280 --> 3:03:24.120]  staying on topic they were talking about the economy and ducy dared to ask about inflation
[3:03:25.160 --> 3:03:31.880]  right the rising cost of goods and services for all americans that has nothing to do with the economy
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:38.200]  no wonder he called a member of the media a stupid sob who's the bully now msnbc's tiffany
[3:03:38.200 --> 3:03:44.680]  cross takes it beyond bullying and just jumps to inciting violence it is indeed a war and i have to
[3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:49.640]  say they have won some battles jasmine but we we have to keep our eye on the war and everybody
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:54.680]  needs to pick up a weapon and get involved and here's one for the misinfo police germany has
[3:03:54.680 --> 3:04:00.520]  to acknowledge its pandemic of the unvaccinated narrative is fake news but the health minister
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:06.600]  says it was just a computer glitch an investigation from area newspapers there found that hamburg's
[3:04:06.600 --> 3:04:13.480]  social services department's numbers were skewed in most cases they didn't know who was vexed or not
[3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:20.440]  they didn't stop them from classifying all unknown vexed statuses as unvaccinated and you would think
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:26.120]  a cop killer would make headline news but most of the media are ignoring the alleged shooting of
[3:04:26.120 --> 3:04:33.240]  harris county constable charles galley during a traffic stop why isn't msm interested could it
[3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:39.000]  be that the one facing capital murder charges is an illegal immigrant the pr machine for the
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:43.640]  administration wouldn't want to draw any more attention to the border crisis or the violence
[3:04:43.640 --> 3:04:47.720]  and ramifications that come with it now would they and that's your media mouthpiece and it's
[3:04:47.720 --> 3:04:58.600]  for the week for k l i m dot news i'm christy lee i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost
[3:04:58.600 --> 3:05:05.160]  28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and
[3:05:05.160 --> 3:05:10.440]  stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people
[3:05:10.440 --> 3:05:16.840]  are awake yes we're not getting caught flatfooted but they are going ahead with their full operational
[3:05:16.840 --> 3:05:21.960]  the industrialization great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers
[3:05:21.960 --> 3:05:26.760]  and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and
[3:05:26.760 --> 3:05:31.320]  ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda
[3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:35.400]  we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality
[3:05:35.400 --> 3:05:40.920]  storeable food you got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com
[3:05:40.920 --> 3:05:46.040]  so whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets it's ready to ship right

[3:07:09.880 --> 3:07:16.040]  freedom convoy truckers cause chaos in Ottawa after second day of protest
[3:07:16.040 --> 3:07:19.080]  that's the BBC
[3:07:22.120 --> 3:07:30.600]  truckers cause chaos how about truckers are taking to the streets because their rights are being

[3:10:12.040 --> 3:10:21.880]  maybe hey maybe Al Jazeera you can't count that high this is outright propaganda totally black
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:27.720]  bald by the media I shouldn't say black bald I'll be called racist

[3:11:46.280 --> 3:11:53.400]  I did rallies out of Alberta where they zoom me in of course I couldn't go there because I'm not
[3:11:53.400 --> 3:12:05.400]  faxed and I told the guys I said listen they have to go and not leave I said I don't know the first
[3:12:05.400 --> 3:12:14.600]  thing about trucking but I know a lot about politics briefly at a graduate school and my degree was
[3:12:14.600 --> 3:12:22.600]  in public administration I was a guy running may involve the major political campaigns in west
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:29.240]  chester county the richest county in america yeah angelo martinelli became the longest running
[3:12:29.240 --> 3:12:37.080]  mayor of yonkers oh it's only a city of over 200 000 people yeah I was a campaign coordinator
[3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:48.120]  it worked on district attorney senate state senate has been there I was the assistant to
[3:12:48.120 --> 3:12:54.520]  the secretary of the new york state senate at 26 years old I designed and instructed american
[3:12:54.520 --> 3:13:01.080]  politics and campaign technology how to run political campaigns and how to get things done
[3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:07.160]  the way you want and I taught it at st john's university I was a chief government affairs
[3:13:07.160 --> 3:13:13.720]  specialist of a major trade association I was killing environmental legislation at the height
[3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:19.960]  of the environmental movement back in the 1970s that's where my head was I bought into the system
[3:13:21.160 --> 3:13:28.440]  but then I wised up I wouldn't know what I know if I wasn't on the other side so I told them the
[3:13:28.440 --> 3:13:37.000]  only way this is going to work is if the truckers go and they don't leave day in day out until these
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:44.600]  draconian mandates are lifted and if you don't believe me look how the burlin wall came down
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:51.960]  they went they didn't leave look at how the india farmers they got rid of that bill that
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:56.040]  modi was going to pass they went to the streets day after day night after night week after week
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:14:04.840]  month after month until they won they just stopped Rio Tinto in Serbia from building a lithium
[3:14:04.840 --> 3:14:13.160]  mine they didn't want it the people took to the streets they didn't leave they beat them we can
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:22.760]  beat them going to a rally for one day and going home means nothing and if you don't believe me
[3:14:22.760 --> 3:14:31.880]  you can ask that guy Casper Weinberger who was the defense secretary under Ronald Reagan
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:37.640]  they had a massive protest here in New York I'll never forget it March of Washington Square Park
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:46.840]  up to Central Park a million people almost a million people defense secretary Casper Weinberger
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:53.240]  an interview taped Friday for broadcast tonight in New York said quote the fact that a very large
[3:14:53.240 --> 3:14:57.560]  number of people turn out for a particular event is certainly something that people notice
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:06.840]  but I don't think that anybody rushes back and says we have to change our policy or something
[3:15:06.840 --> 3:15:18.120]  because there's been a rally get it get it get useless if you go one day and go home what the
[3:15:18.120 --> 3:15:27.480]  truckers are doing now is gigantic and it can make a great difference in freedom peace and
[3:15:27.480 --> 3:15:40.360]  justice it's this is big and the media is ignoring it we this this this can change things in a way

[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:46.840]  junior who i deeply respect and i was a speaker at ron paul's war on us event and i was a speaker

[3:23:04.200 --> 3:23:08.040]  the only way you win this is by going and not leaving until you
[3:23:08.040 --> 3:23:18.360]  demands a met and you make it peaceful as they're doing and that's what i told the people on in
[3:23:18.360 --> 3:23:27.400]  alberta this has to be peaceful it has to be continual if they demand that you move the trucks
[3:23:27.400 --> 3:23:35.240]  move them go nice and slow and stop stop and go oh when you run out of gas ask the police to get
[3:23:35.240 --> 3:23:39.080]  your gas so you can move on and you don't leave until your rights are returned
[3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:51.640]  this is terrible what's going on the language that they're using to discriminate against people
[3:23:53.080 --> 3:24:00.040]  who refuse to follow their mandates that that that yeah i'm going to make up a story we're

[3:25:32.280 --> 3:25:37.320]  they wear those stupid masks is because air pollution used to make fun of them the people
[3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:46.600]  of america got so afraid of the covid you can't make this stuff up the first thing that they did
[3:25:48.600 --> 3:25:51.720]  was they ran to the grocery store to buy toilet paper
[3:25:54.760 --> 3:26:00.440]  all right you can't make this it was a science fiction movie you could not make this up
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:06.840]  it shows you what a bunch of crap heads the people are hey you know the neanderthals will

[3:26:25.480 --> 3:26:31.160]  over more power from the dictators in charge that have robbed the people of their freedom
[3:26:31.160 --> 3:26:44.840]  peace and justice this is draconian that people are being forced to take an operation warp speed
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:57.720]  m r na injection the first ever injected into a human being they're usually tested for what
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:03.880]  five twelve years rushed into market and they refuse it in their demeaned
[3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:13.240]  and let's go back a little true dope over there you're fully vaccinated and you got the virus
[3:27:13.240 --> 3:27:21.000]  you're around vaccinated people all the time how did you get the virus you mean the vax for spreading

[3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:33.720]  oh but i would have died if i didn't get it yes the bs they put out there but how about the other
[3:27:33.720 --> 3:27:46.440]  people who say how sick they got from it so what happened to the 96 efficacy rate that they were
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:57.800]  selling a year ago i'm not making that up that's the number they said two shots 96 efficacy
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:05.160]  oh and now according to the israeli health ministry it's 39 percent oh and it doesn't last
[3:28:05.160 --> 3:28:13.000]  that long does it this is going to be a shot a year just like the flu and as bad as the flu
[3:28:13.880 --> 3:28:23.240]  because they don't have a great track record either again follow what's going on in the canadian

[3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:51.480]  yep go back to when it was great i saw pictures of people online during a great depression
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:57.880]  a long line to new york city as far as you could see and the men were dressed up with
[3:41:57.880 --> 3:42:05.080]  hats and size and jackets there was a thing called dignity of america it's gone
[3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:15.880]  until we bring back dignity and respect and self-respect it's going to keep going lower

[3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:07.000]  very very simple but the most people don't know the privately owned central banks of the world
[3:44:07.960 --> 3:44:14.360]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using
[3:44:14.360 --> 3:44:22.200]  them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property energy they're using it to buy people to buy
[3:44:22.200 --> 3:44:28.120]  influence and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[3:44:28.120 --> 3:44:32.920]  manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it
[3:44:32.920 --> 3:44:38.040]  would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every
[3:44:38.040 --> 3:44:43.880]  sector of the world economy buying up everything not to have the companies operate but to actually
[3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:49.160]  shut them down and force the collapse of civilization making the companies they do find
[3:44:49.160 --> 3:44:53.160]  the only things left standing this is the great reset this is what's happening now
[3:44:53.160 --> 3:45:00.200]  warn everyone it's the only way to stop it reset we're not worse than a great tool
[3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:08.920]  it really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily go
[3:45:08.920 --> 3:45:14.840]  across political lines or religious lines but about all of us as a human species coming together
[3:45:14.840 --> 3:45:20.680]  i'm a combat veteran and i mean that brought me close to god but what alex does through
[3:45:20.680 --> 3:45:26.120]  brought me even closer i can feel god in my life now the viruses that alex talks to you about that
[3:45:26.120 --> 3:45:32.200]  are subconsciously programmed into your brain and how to erase those programs and install new
[3:45:32.200 --> 3:45:37.960]  reset wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular info wars broadcasts it's an academic
[3:45:37.960 --> 3:45:43.160]  level course that will raise your awareness and help you live a more conscious and self-determined

[3:45:57.960 --> 3:46:03.800]  get our great bag of it here i mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico the
[3:46:03.800 --> 3:46:08.840]  communists well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:14.040]  organic in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[3:46:14.040 --> 3:46:17.400]  that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the
[3:46:17.400 --> 3:46:21.400]  point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the mexican government
[3:46:21.400 --> 3:46:25.320]  take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years
[3:46:25.320 --> 3:46:29.000]  and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:33.160]  50 percent more per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere
[3:46:33.160 --> 3:46:38.920]  it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally um in fact i'm gonna tell you a

[3:47:47.240 --> 3:47:52.360]  we have the trends journal magazine it's a weekly like nothing else in the world nothing comes close
[3:47:52.360 --> 3:47:58.520]  to it and if you could show me one that does let me know and last week was 149 pages a week before
[3:47:58.520 --> 3:48:04.760]  161 and again no ads you know so we're giving people everything they can because we're we're
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:09.960]  on a rough road ahead and you look at the markets today oh they're up yeah there we go when all
[3:48:09.960 --> 3:48:15.880]  those fails they take you to war and that that's we'll talk about that later but first i want to
[3:48:15.880 --> 3:48:23.880]  talk about the equity markets and yeah they were up and uh and so interest rates going up but how
[3:48:23.880 --> 3:48:29.560]  far will the fed raise interest rates and what effect will it be so here's the deal you have
[3:48:29.560 --> 3:48:36.200]  inflation now and the cpi number came in it was seven percent right so even if they raise interest
[3:48:36.200 --> 3:48:43.720]  rates and 50 basis points you're still deep in negative territory and then you see the markets
[3:48:43.720 --> 3:48:49.960]  they're down a thousand points and all of a sudden boom they're up do you hear the plunge protection
[3:48:49.960 --> 3:49:02.040]  team the game is being rigged game is being rigged fed daily supports rate lift off and march
[3:49:03.720 --> 3:49:07.640]  yep they're gonna and they're gonna say they're gonna raise them more will they i don't know
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:15.480]  but here's what i do know if they didn't rig the markets january was going into the worst
[3:49:15.480 --> 3:49:23.800]  months since march when the covet war really hit hard of 2020 he had one three weeks in a row was down
[3:49:27.640 --> 3:49:31.960]  and now again they're down or pop they pop up all of a sudden
[3:49:33.880 --> 3:49:42.440]  they can't take higher interest rates excuse me it's not the supply chain disruptions only
[3:49:42.440 --> 3:49:49.640]  that caused rising inflation what really caused it was all the trillions of dollars of cheap money
[3:49:49.640 --> 3:49:55.880]  the government and the federal reserve dumped into the system and when i say government and
[3:49:55.880 --> 3:50:01.080]  federal reserve they really won because all you have to do is look at who the treasury secretary is
[3:50:01.640 --> 3:50:08.600]  miss fatsha brut the janet yellen and um the only one woman was in charge i'm tired of that crap
[3:50:08.600 --> 3:50:14.520]  black white green yellow save it don't want to hear it good bed comes in all of them anyway
[3:50:14.520 --> 3:50:18.680]  where was she come from she's our treasury secretary and she was the form of fed head
[3:50:20.040 --> 3:50:23.320]  all right so the federal reserve is the government
[3:50:25.480 --> 3:50:33.880]  it's not we the people they're gonna do everything they can to keep the economy going but here's my
[3:50:33.880 --> 3:50:43.400]  forecast you ready they're gonna do a paul volcker 2022 paul volcker was the federal reserve chairman
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:53.480]  back in the 1980s matter of fact 1982 whoop 82 22 yep history's repeating itself what happened
[3:50:53.480 --> 3:51:00.040]  inflation was skyrocket it raised interest rates why 18 percent of something was ridiculous
[3:51:00.040 --> 3:51:09.880]  that's right whoop went into a severe recession i ended up buying in rimebeck new york which is
[3:51:09.880 --> 3:51:14.280]  right i'm in kinkston now right across the river because rimebeck got too white for me so i don't
[3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:19.560]  like it anymore the arrogant people of money oh i have a lot of money don't you know why i have
[3:51:19.560 --> 3:51:25.880]  i'll screw you anyway i bought 38 acres in an old house i have demolished everything
[3:51:25.880 --> 3:51:34.600]  would be the whole place but anyway 38 acres three lots for $28,000 that's right that's how
[3:51:34.600 --> 3:51:41.880]  bad it was in 1984 when they raised interest rates like that then what happened whoop they
[3:51:41.880 --> 3:51:51.480]  dramatically lowered them before the election in 1984 yeah and guess what you just saw the gdp
[3:51:51.480 --> 3:51:59.720]  jumped for this year because of all the cheap dough they threw in the gdp jumped in 1984 this
[3:51:59.720 --> 3:52:06.680]  is the highest-rated jump now since then so the feds are going to do the same thing they're going
[3:52:06.680 --> 3:52:15.240]  to slow down the economy and then before the election in 2024 they're going to lower interest
[3:52:15.240 --> 3:52:23.240]  rates dramatically and boost the economy and there used to be a campaign slogan back in 1992
[3:52:23.800 --> 3:52:31.720]  when murderer lying lowlife piece of scum garbage arrogant crap bill clinton was
[3:52:31.720 --> 3:52:38.040]  running for president the line used to be it's the economy stupid that's all the people care about
[3:52:38.040 --> 3:52:48.920]  so that's my take on it it's going to go down and then the plan whether it works or not is that
[3:52:48.920 --> 3:52:53.480]  they're going to lower interest rates dramatically before the election because the midterms are
[3:52:53.480 --> 3:52:57.400]  shot already they're not going to they're going to go down and they know it they don't care they
[3:52:57.400 --> 3:53:03.000]  don't care about themselves and that's the presidency so that's how i'm looking at a lot
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:10.200]  of the economy on the covet warfront this thing's going to wind down late march mid april you're
[3:53:10.200 --> 3:53:16.440]  going to start feeling a wind down because it's destroying businesses at levels that are unprecedented
[3:53:17.480 --> 3:53:25.480]  and the political the poly ticks the many ticks that suck the life out of us these little clowns
[3:53:25.480 --> 3:53:31.640]  and the bureau craps that these are people never can't get a job in the real world and they're
[3:53:31.640 --> 3:53:39.480]  into the political system they suck their way in they got to get revenue coming in so they can keep
[3:53:39.480 --> 3:53:45.160]  their jobs and doing nothing and making up crap so they're going to have to boost the economy
[3:53:46.120 --> 3:53:49.000]  so my forecast is they're going to
[3:53:51.960 --> 3:53:58.760]  start winding down the covet war and there's going to be a boost there's going to be a sharp boost
[3:53:58.760 --> 3:54:05.000]  no question about it that's anyway that's my turn forecast on this and that's why i was talking
[3:54:05.000 --> 3:54:11.160]  about the phonies the frauds and the freaks and you have you had this thing with spotify where you
[3:54:11.160 --> 3:54:19.240]  had um neil young and johnny mitchell asking for their music to be removed you know we wrote about
[3:54:19.240 --> 3:54:24.680]  this in the trends journal about the so-called actors you know over over the months selling
[3:54:24.680 --> 3:54:31.320]  the vaccines johnny mitchell and anneal young weren't these the hippies back in the day
[3:54:32.120 --> 3:54:36.760]  that were protesting against government dictates like the vietnam war and other things
[3:54:36.760 --> 3:54:40.920]  look at what little corporate sellouts they they are and that guy that guy what's his name
[3:54:40.920 --> 3:54:47.000]  anneal young is a year older than me modern me i hope i don't look as bad as he does
