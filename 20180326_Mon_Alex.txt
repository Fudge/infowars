[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[00:28.000 --> 00:39.000]  Black Lives Matter would have Black Americans believe that they should fall in line when it comes to the confiscation of the one thing that stands in the way of tyrannical oppression, the Second Amendment.
[00:39.000 --> 00:50.000]  Rapper Killer Mike and others have spoken up for the great equalizer with a long history of protecting Black communities now threatened by an unrelenting liberal agenda.
[00:50.000 --> 01:08.000]  We are raising a generation of kids where everyone gets a trophy, but in real life, everyone don't get a trophy. In real life, the cops don't come on time. In real life, depending on where you live, you're not going to have the time to try to logic your way out of something.
[01:08.000 --> 01:25.000]  I think if you look right after the Emancipation Proclamation, what was going on down in the southern states, it's very clear that the Dixie Crats wanted to disarm Black people to keep us from defending ourselves against the Klansmen who were murdering white and Black Republicans to control the ballot box.
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.000]  So I think history is ripe with examples of there's a correlation, the recollection between gun control and Black people control.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  From what was said today, it seems that gun control, in fact, hurts the African-American community.
[01:40.000 --> 01:50.000]  You may have seen why there was so much gun control earlier in life, in American life, because gun control is about controlling people.
[01:50.000 --> 02:01.000]  The right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny. Not to hunt. It's to protect yourself from the police.
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  And do you see any link between that and the source of incidents?
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.000]  No.
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.000]  No, not really. You know what I'm saying? If somebody wants to kill people, they don't need a gun to do it.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.000]  Makes it easier, though, doesn't it?
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  Not really. You can strap explosives on your body. They do that all the time.
[02:19.000 --> 02:36.000]  Let me tell you what Frederick Douglass said about the right of self-defense. When government fails to protect the just right of any individual man, that man rests on his original right of self-defense even if it means shooting down his pursuers.
[02:36.000 --> 02:46.000]  Slaves plus guns equal freedom. The abolition of slavery was inevitably due to the arming of Blacks.
[02:46.000 --> 02:59.000]  Now, if you think, for one minute, that I'm going to cede these rights back to the federal government or any government or any court, you better think again.
[02:59.000 --> 03:13.000]  And why should these folks be concerned? The recently signed omnibus, snuck Senator John Kornian's Fixed NICS Act, gun control legislation, right by the American people, gun owners of America rights.
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  The bill now contains Take the Guns First Language to send millions of additional names to the FBI background check system.
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.000]  These will include many veterans and older seniors, plus those with outstanding traffic tickets and medical marijuana cards.
[03:27.000 --> 03:37.000]  But then there's more. The GOP's school safety proposal, also buried in the more than 2,200 page bill, prohibits money from being used for guns and gun training.
[03:37.000 --> 03:45.000]  So none of the omnibus funds can be used to arm teachers or school resource officers, as had been proposed to the American people.
[03:45.000 --> 03:59.000]  Not someone who's overstayed a visa, not someone who crossed the border without permission, but an American citizen, what process is currently afforded an American citizen before they go on that list?
[03:59.000 --> 04:09.000]  I'm sorry. There's not a process afforded the citizen prior to getting on the list. There is a process should someone feel they are unduly placed on the list.
[04:09.000 --> 04:23.000]  Yes, there is. And when I say process, I'm actually using half of the term due process, which is a phrase we find in the Constitution, that you cannot deprive people of certain things without due process.
[04:23.000 --> 04:33.000]  There are far greater economic issues plaguing parts of America that unfortunately require a defenseless American citizen, like a woman, for instance, to pack heat.
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  Take that away and America plummets into far more chaos than it's already in.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[04:43.000 --> 05:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, we're going to kick off the main broadcast. We are seeing the totally synthetic artificial Soros Democratic Party funded move to not just destroy the Second Amendment, but also the First Amendment, but the sleeping giant is away.
[05:00.000 --> 05:20.000]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[05:54.000 --> 06:14.000]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber. Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[06:25.000 --> 06:53.000]  Well, on the heels of the omnibus debacle Friday in that nightmare situation, we are then treated to a half a million young people led by their teachers, led by their professors, led by the breakaway.
[06:53.000 --> 07:19.000]  Government of government employees marching to have the constitutional right that the country was founded on and that actually started the Revolutionary War, marching to declare gun owners the enemy and marching to declare that they would confiscate all of our guns and kill anyone that did not turn them in.
[07:19.000 --> 07:26.000]  We have video clip after video clip or video clip of them saying we're going to ban all your guns. We're going to take all your guns.
[07:26.000 --> 07:33.000]  And you may say that you're going to take it from our cold dead hands. Well, we're going to take it from your cold dead hands.
[07:33.000 --> 07:51.000]  We've got the signs, we've got the speeches, we've got videos from around the country, not just in DC with people running for office for the office of sheriff and other offices saying, sure, you're not going to turn your guns in, we're going to kill you.
[07:51.000 --> 08:11.000]  And of course, congressmen going and speaking in town hall saying time to use the Second Amendment against Trump. This is a real move by the globalist by the left by George Soros, who successfully overthrown countless countries including Ukraine to pull off the same thing here in the United States.
[08:11.000 --> 08:34.000]  That is what we're facing. That is what we're dealing with. This is the reality. They know politically the country is realigning against globalism, realigning against collectivism, realigning against socialism, realigning against the Department of Education and all these predatory groups and they don't know what to do except get aggressive.
[08:34.000 --> 08:54.000]  They played clips of myself and Dana Losh over and over and over again during the eight hour event that C-SPAN covered live. And they would play clips of me saying Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, and if you try to take the guns, 1776 will commence again.
[08:54.000 --> 09:12.000]  They think that by putting that out, which is true, it's inoculating the students to where when they hear the truth later in life they never wake up and go, wow, Hitler, Stalin and Mao did take the guns. Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[09:12.000 --> 09:24.000]  And then they played Dana Losh saying they'll march and they'll rally and they'll blame gun owners but will stand firm. So it's a tactic they use and I see it a lot. I don't know what to call it.
[09:24.000 --> 09:43.000]  But it's where they take something that's totally true like water's wet or 2 plus 2 equals 4 or free market works better than socialism or America's better than most other countries and then America actually has lower crime rates than countries that have total gun bans like Mexico, Brazil and many others
[09:43.000 --> 09:55.000]  and that the only country with lower crime rates than us is in Europe, Switzerland, that has basically almost no crime because of their right to keep their arms and that the pockets of crime are in blue areas where they have gun bans.
[09:55.000 --> 10:11.000]  They were playing clips. Last night I got home and I watched hours of it because it had archived. It was over. The live event was over so I could fast forward to shots in between set changes when they had other Hollywood people come out or other rock bands come out
[10:11.000 --> 10:26.000]  and call for gun control in between the washed up Hollywood stars and Democratic Party operative students reading their teleprompters and their talking points and they would play clips of me and Dana Losh and clips of
[10:26.000 --> 10:41.000]  Charles and Heston and clips of Wayne LaPierre and clips of the Motor City madman and my fellow patriot and now Texan who I want to get back on the show this week. We're about to air the big interview we did with him.
[10:41.000 --> 10:54.000]  Ted Nugent. They played clips of Governor Huckabee. They played clips of everybody demonizing him saying this is the enemy and then they would sit there and say we're coming from you. You're shaking in your boots. We're going to get you.
[10:54.000 --> 11:09.000]  So what is that tactic where they put truthful things we're saying up and then demonize it. Remember just a month ago the big evil YouTube was taking down my channels. They were taking out thousands of other channels.
[11:09.000 --> 11:31.000]  Weeks later they banned most of the gun channels and they said you're bullying children claiming that David Hogg and others are crisis actors and no one happened in Parkland. No one died. Was it true? What we said was out of 3,000 students they picked four to fly around on private jets who were Democratic Party operatives to spout their propaganda over and over
[11:31.000 --> 11:41.000]  and over and over and over and over again. And then when anybody criticized them they said oh you're bullying kids.
[11:41.000 --> 11:54.000]  And then they ran newscast all over the place saying look Jones is insane. He says this students movement nationwide is synthetic and funded the day after.
[11:54.000 --> 12:12.000]  The Women's March funded by George Soros and the Democratic Party said we're running this. We're funding it. We're organizing it and then Buzzfeed a week later admitted it. So I was reporting facts and their response was misrepresent what Alex Jones has said and then shut him up.
[12:12.000 --> 12:28.000]  Then David Hogg over the last week put out a profanity laced video going F gun owners, F old people, they're all morons. We played the bleep clip. That was banned. So YouTube banned a video of David Hogg bullying himself.
[12:28.000 --> 12:42.000]  See because Hogg's like Jesus. You're aren't allowed to criticize him. He's the second coming. He's a public figure. He now wears a purple armband. I mean the fascist iconography is incredible.
[12:42.000 --> 12:50.000]  And they're saying this public figure cannot be criticized. So they're going to have their cake and eat it too. Go up to the First Amendment.
[12:50.000 --> 13:01.000]  And so George Soros funded media matters. Did the same thing where they took the truthful clip. I said the truthful statement again. This is on March 4th.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  I've been saying it for a week before that.
[13:05.000 --> 13:20.000]  Or for two weeks before that happened on Valentine's Day. And they played it with a clip from my own home. Like I was weird and I was discredited and I was bad that I said that it was completely scripted.
[13:20.000 --> 13:33.000]  Now that was true then. That is true now. This was 18 days after the Parkland shooting. It was known the day after the Democrats were funding it, giving the scripts.
[13:33.000 --> 13:43.000]  Hogg and others were on video going. I'm sorry. What am I supposed to say? What was it again? Not that they were not victims. Not that the shooting didn't happen.
[13:43.000 --> 13:51.000]  But that they were chosen because they were in the drama club because they were anti-gun and because they would go along with the agenda.
[13:51.000 --> 14:00.000]  And now there they are with thousands of buses. We have videos that Jack was having another shot where you see hundreds pulling in and still hundreds more.
[14:00.000 --> 14:12.000]  I was there in DC when Soros spent $280 plus million. The day after the inauguration of Trump to bring in over a million women and I saw hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of buses just on the streets I saw.
[14:12.000 --> 14:21.000]  That's major money. And then if you say that, you're evil. If you say that, you're bad. If you say that, it doesn't exist. They want to kill logic.
[14:21.000 --> 14:31.000]  So here is George Soros' group, Media Matters, immoralizing me saying the sky is blue. But again, they put it out like, oh look, don't say this. It's wrong.
[14:31.000 --> 14:39.000]  It's this appeal to authority like, where media matters? And all the rest of the media has to look at this now. And here's your script. Go out and say Alex Jones made this up.
[14:39.000 --> 14:47.000]  This is completely grass roots. The private jets, the thousands of buses, the hundreds of millions of dollars. Here it is.
[14:47.000 --> 15:02.000]  It's 11 o'clock at night, Texas time. And I'm live here on Facebook for now. We have been banned from live streaming and uploading on our main YouTube channel with billions of views.
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.000]  And I tend to get really animated here on air and on these murders.
[15:07.000 --> 15:14.000]  You know what? I went to this light. We're going to come back to this. But this is what they put out on the news as fake news.
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.000]  Me saying it was scripted and paid for the whole response to get our guns. And now we have the videos and their statements where they openly say it.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  But let's go out with Hogg saying you're shaking because he's coming. Here it is.
[15:26.000 --> 15:33.000]  You can hear the people in power shaking. They've gotten used to being protective of their positions.
[15:33.000 --> 15:44.000]  The safety of inaction. The safety of the globalist bodyguards. The safety of the Republicans trying to get our guns too.
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  The power structure is shaking that the American people are awake and most young people are awake. And studies show most generation Z's are awake.
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  And so this is an attempt by Hollywood, the old globalist order, to hype up and push a bunch of young people.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  That means the new spokespersons to suck around a whole other generation.
[15:59.000 --> 16:06.000]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you? I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[16:06.000 --> 16:13.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too. I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[16:21.000 --> 16:29.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[16:51.000 --> 17:06.000]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clawed arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[17:06.000 --> 17:16.000]  But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.

[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[19:00.000 --> 19:11.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[19:16.000 --> 19:24.000]  Made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[19:26.000 --> 19:36.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[19:36.000 --> 19:46.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[19:46.000 --> 19:53.000]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[19:56.000 --> 20:07.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShieldInfoWarsLive.com.
[20:26.000 --> 20:36.000]  February 2018, another Liberal Democrat Blue City Sheriff's Department stood down.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  Coward County and it wasn't one deputy, it wasn't two, it wasn't three, it wasn't four, now we know it's more than 10.
[20:42.000 --> 20:49.000]  Just as witnesses that we had on that day and the day after said they went outside and there was Sheriff's Department all just sitting there.
[20:49.000 --> 20:55.000]  And then those videos were banned and they said that I had said that no one died.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  And then folks actually saw the videos and they went, that isn't what Mr. Jones said.
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.000]  So it backfired and YouTube had to put our channel back up.
[21:03.000 --> 21:10.000]  And David Hogg and others came out and called for us to basically be shut down.
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  Because it's not just our second amendment that they're after, they're after our first amendment.
[21:18.000 --> 21:31.000]  Now let's continue here on the heels of that I get sued, Fox News gets sued for pointing out that Democrats were funding Antifa that helped exacerbate what happened in Charlottesville.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  They then misrepresent what we said about that.
[21:34.000 --> 21:45.000]  So this is the tactic as they're getting their script ready, using a crisis, not letting it go to waste, as Rahm Emanuel said, the former Chief of Staff for Obama.
[21:45.000 --> 22:05.000]  So they go pick four young people to fly around on jets who then put out the exact Bloomberg, Obama, Hillary, slash, Michael Moore playbook, word for word, as anti-gun activists who are now saying they want gun bans in America.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  First they said just reasonable restrictions.
[22:07.000 --> 22:12.000]  Now we have their speeches, we have their signs, they're up on infowars.com.
[22:12.000 --> 22:21.000]  There's a Steve Watson article we can pull up and show TV viewers where sign after sign says, we'll take your gun from your cold dead hand.
[22:21.000 --> 22:28.000]  We'll confiscate your firearms, we'll ban all guns, on and on and on.
[22:28.000 --> 22:34.000]  And then we've got other speeches around the country at town halls, the same things being said.
[22:34.000 --> 22:44.000]  So this is their agenda, they're being very, very, very honest with us and some of the speakers we're going to play clips in the next segment said the exact same thing.
[22:44.000 --> 22:51.000]  One of the first four from Parkland, the four horsemen of the Second Amendment apocalypse.
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  That's what they want, that's what they're pushing.
[22:54.000 --> 23:03.000]  But they didn't want the narrative out there of, hey, the Democrats are funding this, hey, Soros admits he's funding this, hey, they're flying around on private jets, hey, CNN staging town halls
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  and only letting people give the questions that they've been handed.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  Hey, a lot of these students are conservative libertarian including victims and they don't have a voice.
[23:12.000 --> 23:20.000]  Those were the videos the first week being banned by YouTube via CNN's complaints that were filed.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  They're tortuous interference so that you wouldn't see the other students that we were having on.
[23:25.000 --> 23:30.000]  Silencing them so they could steal their right.
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.000]  And again, media matters and puts out the statements, the rest of the media, fake media picks it up.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  And so you put a video out, 18 days after it happens, totally admitted the Democrats are funding it all.
[23:42.000 --> 23:48.000]  They edit the video where I don't show the article in Buzzfeed where the Democrats admit they're running it and Soros is funding it.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  They just clip it out and say, look, Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[23:52.000 --> 23:59.000]  He says the sky is blue and because they've attached my name to it, they're selling the idea that I'm discredited.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  Because they want to discredit me at the same time they want to discredit the Second Amendment.
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.000]  And they recognize him for wars is at the heart of defending the Second Amendment and mobilizing the people.
[24:10.000 --> 24:20.000]  Newsweek and Time eight years ago in two separate articles said Alex Jones is the prophet of the Tea Party.
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.000]  And that just means the guy out in the wilderness that is generating the culture, that is generating the playbook,
[24:26.000 --> 24:33.000]  that is generating the blueprint, that is generating the talking points that they then saw matriculating into talk radio,
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  then onto Fox News and then into Congress.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  And yes, it's true. We are patient zero.
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  But all I've done is bring the cure to their globalism from Americana in history.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  I didn't write the playbook of success in America.
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.000]  I simply re-uploaded it, you re-uploaded it, you the audience and now we're giving them a run for their money.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  So the enemy is striking back and striking back hard.
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  But we have the data, we have the plans, we have their operations and we have the counterpoints.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  So here I am stating what's admitted fact as you see the crowd of a half million bust in
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  and seen in lying about the crowd side and saying it was a million, Capitol Police said half a million.
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.000]  And now you understand what they're scared of, the fact that I say two plus two equals four.
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.000]  Here I am on March 4th saying two plus two equals four.
[25:27.000 --> 25:37.000]  Even 18 days after, they were still saying that the Democrats weren't involved.
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.000]  Here it is.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  They want to be able to smoke.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  They want to be able to have big drinks and soda.
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  Here it is.
[25:47.000 --> 25:55.000]  It's 11 o'clock at night, Texas time and I'm live here on Facebook for now.
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  We have been banned from live streaming and uploading on our main YouTube channel with billions of views.
[26:03.000 --> 26:10.000]  And I tend to get really animated here on air and in these emergency videos I do.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  But I'm going to really try to be calm today because of the super grave nature of all this.
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  And we will upload this on some backup channels.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  But think about where America has gotten and where Europe has gotten.
[26:25.000 --> 26:33.000]  Where the political left is arresting old women that share memes against ISIS.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  And they put them in prison.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  That was in the news today.
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  And they're only a few years ahead of where we are.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  This is the authoritarianism of our generation.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  And they say every three generations really hard core tyranny tends to come.
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  And we're in the middle of that by any historical yardstick.
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.000]  We have seen a huge national scandal that started seven days ago on a Friday.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  It's Friday night right now.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  I'm coming to you from my home.
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  I'm going to walk through all this.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  But last Friday CNN said we are lobbying YouTube to take down Alex Jones.
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.000]  He says no kids died in Florida.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  He says they're all crisis actors.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  And then they banned videos where I was saying they're not crisis actors.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  It's a real shooting.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  They just been Democratic Party operatives and been scripted for what they're saying before they chose for media coverage out of 3,000.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  That's all come out.
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  So that was seven days after I guess a week or so after that they republished the video.
[27:41.000 --> 27:51.000]  The point is that it's this weird tactic where they take something that's totally true and they put it out there like it's totally false.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  And this is their big assault.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  And so we should all be pointing out it's synthetic.
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  It's organized.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  It's manufactured.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  It's trying to steal our right.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  They don't get into the Sheriff's Department standing down.
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  They don't get into the fact that the person wasn't allowed to own guns.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  They don't get into the fact that he'd been adjudicated mentally ill.
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  They don't get into the fact that other students don't want to be anti-gun and that they're being silenced.
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  They don't get into the fact they're trying to shut down the free speech of pro-gun people.
[28:20.000 --> 28:29.000]  They don't get into any of those societal issues or that where you take the guns you have higher crime rates in every case across the world, not just here in the U.S.
[28:29.000 --> 28:40.000]  They want to blame American gun owners and put guilt on us for 16 dead young people in a Democrat run victim disarmament zone where they stood down.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  And then if you criticize that they try to silence you while they talk about how they're going to kill us.
[28:45.000 --> 28:53.000]  And when I come back I'm going to play them saying they're coming to take our guns, they're going to ban them all and they're going to take them from our cold dead hands and they're going to kill us.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  Well of course you want to take our guns so you can kill us.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  We understand what you're all about scum.
[29:27.000 --> 29:36.000]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  Since 2005 thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[29:40.000 --> 29:48.000]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size for incredibly delicious water now and in an emergency.
[29:48.000 --> 29:59.000]  Get to goberkey.com or call 877-886-3653 877-886-3653 goberkey.com
[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  I want to plow into all of this.
[30:02.000 --> 30:13.000]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos

[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[31:27.000 --> 31:30.000]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[31:30.000 --> 31:31.000]  That's amazing.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. I haven't felt sweet.

[31:55.000 --> 32:01.000]  It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  Full potential of protein rich foods again.
[32:27.000 --> 32:35.000]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[32:35.000 --> 32:43.000]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[32:43.000 --> 32:50.000]  Cardivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.

[32:54.000 --> 33:00.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now. That's infowarslife.com.
[33:24.000 --> 33:35.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:35.000 --> 33:40.000]  I think it's important to really sit back from the 30,000-foot view and quantify where we're at.
[33:40.000 --> 33:51.000]  Humanity's waking up the fact that there are big multinational corporations that are involved in social engineering to try to make the public as docile, dumb, and atomized.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  That means alone as possible.
[33:55.000 --> 34:03.000]  And everywhere the globalists are in control, they're engaging in genocide of Christians, genocide of whites, and genocide of Western culture.
[34:03.000 --> 34:12.000]  There's another article out by Dan Lyman. Genocide of white South Africans accelerating Warren's Australian senator.
[34:12.000 --> 34:21.000]  And the government of South Africa responds by saying, yeah, we're going to not let you leave and basically kill you and take your property.
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.000]  No media coverage here in the United States.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  So that's for your Kumbaya situation right there.
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  And that is all being globalist financed and quarterbacked, and that is the model.
[34:34.000 --> 34:52.000]  Huge news next segment. Communist China is in the news because they manipulate and control many of the data chips and many of the phone switching computers through Swedish, Dutch, German, and other front companies here in the United States.
[34:52.000 --> 35:00.000]  90% of espionage in the U.S. is Chinese. That's well known. That's admitted. I have mainstream news articles getting into it.
[35:00.000 --> 35:14.000]  The reason I raise that issue is Communist China is threatening all sorts of military action against the U.S. trade war, you name it, when they're the ones that have been in trade war with us for at least 50 years.
[35:14.000 --> 35:24.000]  And how does Trump, how does the EU, how does the UK respond with sanctions and expelling Russian diplomats?
[35:24.000 --> 35:31.000]  And just saying you're guilty of nerve-gassing to former Russians living in England with no proof.
[35:31.000 --> 35:42.000]  And then a whole new Cold War is launched on the back of that and Russia is like, it's preposterous. We don't care about some old GRU colonel.
[35:42.000 --> 35:50.000]  So I have stacks of news here dealing with that. China flies bombers and fighter jets near Taiwan as military tensions ramp up.
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.000]  Reuters, Trump to expel 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S.
[35:54.000 --> 36:01.000]  Russia vows imminent response. The U.S. only understands force, close quote.
[36:01.000 --> 36:10.000]  Against common sense and intel law, Russia to retaliate over diplomats expulsion by UK allies.
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  14 EU states announced mass coordinated expulsion of Russian diplomats over the case.
[36:17.000 --> 36:23.000]  So meanwhile, China willing to hold talks with the U.S. and resolve trade differences.
[36:23.000 --> 36:30.000]  And then I have my really big article here, overhaul of U.S. telecom database sparks fear of catastrophic failure.
[36:30.000 --> 36:39.000]  And the article, out of free beacon doesn't get to it later, communist Chinese compromise of the entire U.S. database.
[36:39.000 --> 36:49.000]  You can take down the entire U.S. phone system with their coordinated database in one second flat.
[36:49.000 --> 36:55.000]  But the Russians are going to get us the Russians. I mean, the Russians were involved in our business.
[36:55.000 --> 37:07.000]  I would be all over it. But they're not. And that's why Russia's got some high tech weapons, but they're a big, big country, biggest in the world.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  Geographically, and they're having real trouble. They're heavily infiltrated like we are.
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  And they're tottering on the edge of going under a globalist control.
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  And so that's why the globalists are so excited. They're so close to destroying the U.S.
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  Finally getting us on our knees to have their way with us. They're so close to getting Russia back under their control.
[37:26.000 --> 37:32.000]  And the raping and murder of Christians and just the mass slaughter makes the left drool with pleasure.
[37:32.000 --> 37:41.000]  They understand that they have a rapist energy, just a satanic, child molester energy, and they want to get a hold of Christian countries.
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  People say, well, why didn't it make sense? I know, but study communist, study social, study globalist.
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  They hate you and your family. They hate God. They hate justice. That's what this is.
[37:52.000 --> 37:58.000]  Now, speaking of hating and wanting to kill us, there's a bunch of clips up on infowars.com.
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.000]  There's a Steven Crowder article. There's a Steve Watson article that show the signs in the post.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  And we want to confiscate your guns. And if you don't turn them in, we're going to get you.
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  And if you don't turn them in, we're going to kill you.
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  And they would have like 10 minutes of hate from 1984. They would play a clip of me and the crowd would scream with anger.
[38:18.000 --> 38:24.000]  I mean, they're trying to wind folks up to go out and carry out a major, major attacks.
[38:24.000 --> 38:31.000]  So there's an article up on infowars.com. Candidate for sheriff in North Carolina suggests killing Americans to take their guns.
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  But before that, he just says ban everything but single shot, which is being honest.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  That's what the gun control groups want.
[38:38.000 --> 38:46.000]  And then I've got one of the four, the blonde, not hog, not that his ballheaded Hispanic girl, but the other one.
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  She's up there admitting that they're going to get all the guns.
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.000]  Hashtag March for a live speaker admits true gun control plans.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  So I love how they always double speak. You know, hog, he knows his demographics.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  He'll go on, face the nation and go, nobody wants your guns.
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  Nobody, nobody's trying to take anything. Go to sleepy.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  And then he goes in front of the march. We're going to get them. They're shaking their boots.
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  We're going to take everything. I'm wearing an armband.
[39:12.000 --> 39:21.000]  Cold dead hands.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  So there you go. The signs. Okay, we'll pry from your cold dead hands.
[39:24.000 --> 39:30.000]  But here's the individual running for the sheriff's department in North Carolina.
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  This is a Daryl Fisher. Here he is.
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  First off, we'd like to see age for purchase of any firearm raised between them.
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.000]  I think we should ban the sale of all high capacity magazines, handguns and long guns.
[39:45.000 --> 39:51.000]  I think we need to ban the sale of any mechanism that will allow a firearm to fire in rapid succession.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  Any weapon that's designed for use by the military, I think we should ban.
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.000]  You've heard people say, you'll have to pry my guns from my cold dead hands.
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  Okay.
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  You know, hashtag 100 Republicans. So that's the spirit in the air.
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  They've always wanted our guns to have their political way with us.
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.000]  These are parasites and they're idiot followers.
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.000]  We come back. I've got more of these clips, so I'll get into the serious escalation with Russia.
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  And you know, people are really mad at Trump about signing the omnibus bill, which just means it's,
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  they have 12 spending packages a year, not the budget.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  It's part of the budgetary process. And then you combine one or more. That's an omnibus.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  And yeah, he kind of had a hobson show here.
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.000]  He had a choice where every choice was bad and he wanted to keep the economy going.
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  I'm not defending it, but I think Congress gets the real blame for passing that thing.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  But Trump could have stayed on them more.
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.000]  The big issue is this Russia situation because Trump's way more hardcore on Russia than Obama ever was,
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  because he's getting bullied into it and it only makes it worse.
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  And Russia is not guilty of the things that the globalists say Russia is guilty of.
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  The only thing Russia is guilty of is pulling out of the New World Order.
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  We also have Trump going sideways on exposing vaccines.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  He has put out rhetoric that is not strong on the Second Amendment.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  So he is beginning to listen to political advice, moving in more to the center,
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  which will end up losing us the midterm elections coming up.
[41:27.000 --> 41:33.000]  So Trump's way better than Hillary, and he's gotten rid of a bunch of globalists in the cabinet.
[41:33.000 --> 41:37.000]  There's some good things. He's fighting China, screwing us over on one side of deals.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  It's just that he's not the Messiah and it's not perfect.
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  But the big enemy is the Democrats and the globalists coming for our guns.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  And people better get mobilized because they mean business.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  They've gone from eating around the edges over the years and denying all this stuff.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  They've gone to being very out in the open, everywhere saying they want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  So that's coming up briefly.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  Tim Frosier came in here and he said, Alex, we are going to sell out of Rainforest Plus,
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  our incredibly popular, new tropic, healthy energy, healthy stamina, show good for the brain,
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  our number one best-selling product because it works so well.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  Over 5,000 five-star reviews on power reviews.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  He said, but it's about to sell out.
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  I said, why would we do 50% off if it's about to sell out?
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  He said, because we have a huge shipment coming in two weeks
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  and we've noticed that when we discount Rainforest, it brings people in to buy other products
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  like the Red Pill Challenge, the real Red Pill products now back in stock,
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  which is a seven-day challenge.

[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  the preclinone and so much more.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  So we've got both of those 50% off the real Red Pill

[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale.
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again,
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  hitting the gym once again.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.

[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  Pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria,
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.000]  the probiotics help display yeast mold creates slime walls.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there,
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  it causes all sorts of syrups,
[46:53.000 --> 47:03.520]  The bottle of the new and improved Myco ZX Plus, now from the Info Wars store.
[47:03.520 --> 47:16.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:16.960 --> 47:34.720]  Your trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones show.
[47:34.720 --> 47:43.280]  You know they put in the lawsuit against me that Georgetown University is carrying out
[47:43.280 --> 47:45.720]  against Info Wars of the First Amendment.
[47:45.720 --> 47:48.040]  They're calling for the repeal of the First Amendment in the suit.
[47:48.040 --> 47:54.240]  They said one reason I'm being sued is even though the person isn't a plaintiff is saying
[47:54.240 --> 48:02.000]  that Umar Mateen was an FBI informant in the Pulse nightclub shooting.
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.400]  Now that was in the Associated Press at the time and we just simply pointed out there was
[48:07.400 --> 48:10.200]  another stand down and then he had been saying he was going to do this.
[48:10.200 --> 48:17.040]  Remember his father bizarrely went and stood behind Hillary Clinton at one of her rallies
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.840]  there in Florida just a few miles from where it all happened.
[48:21.840 --> 48:25.240]  You can just type in Umar Mateen's father at Hillary rally.
[48:25.240 --> 48:26.680]  Remember the bizarreness of that?
[48:26.680 --> 48:36.220]  It turns out he's an FBI informant and it's being reported on by CBS News.
[48:36.220 --> 48:42.080]  Where a Pulse government was FBI informant widow attorney says and now because the prosecutors
[48:42.080 --> 48:46.120]  have allowed that into the case they want a mistrial.
[48:46.120 --> 48:52.120]  So not only was the son an FBI informant but he was one too and then the son worked for
[48:52.120 --> 48:57.880]  an international security company a mercenary group and then went and attacked the nightclub
[48:57.880 --> 49:04.360]  and people reported by the way multiple shooters they said no we saw two different men shooting.
[49:04.360 --> 49:12.360]  But then I'm sued and in the suit it says and Jones said Pulse nightclub shooter was
[49:12.360 --> 49:18.120]  an FBI informant just like I said the Democrats are scripting the anti-gun rallies and paying
[49:18.120 --> 49:23.920]  for the buses and the airplanes on record and they bragged they are in AP Reuters Buzzfeed
[49:23.920 --> 49:24.920]  you name it.
[49:24.920 --> 49:31.360]  They then sue me and put in there in the lawsuit that's totally separate they're suing
[49:31.360 --> 49:35.240]  me claiming that I said that the guy the photographer who's a Democrat works at the
[49:35.240 --> 49:41.280]  State Department killed the girl that died in Charlottesville I didn't say that.
[49:41.280 --> 49:46.120]  But then they have a 70 page brief where it says and we're suing him because he said
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.320]  Omar Mateen was an FBI informant and we're suing him because he says the Democrats fund
[49:50.320 --> 49:56.480]  the kids and we're suing him because he says isn't that and then here it is Omar Mateen's
[49:56.480 --> 50:02.560]  father was an FBI informant before Pulse shooting New York Daily News and I told you this last
[50:02.560 --> 50:08.480]  year next year's news today but it was in the news then that's what's crazy is it'll
[50:08.480 --> 50:21.240]  pop up in mainstream news we reported then they attack us and they say that we made it
[50:21.240 --> 50:27.080]  up see I've been chosen as the fake news icon as the fake news card they think the public's
[50:27.080 --> 50:32.080]  dumb doesn't really pay attention so they've decided to brand me as fake news so that if
[50:32.080 --> 50:36.240]  the sun comes up and they want to say it didn't they go Jones said the sun came up people walk
[50:36.240 --> 50:42.000]  out they see a yellow ball they go well Jones is fake so I see a yellow ball but I don't
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.800]  because I don't want to get attacked I don't want to be ridiculed they're culturally saying
[50:45.800 --> 50:50.320]  if you see the sun come up or you say two plus two equals four we're going to viciously
[50:50.320 --> 50:55.160]  attack you and call you names and sue you and go after your sponsors and destroy your
[50:55.160 --> 51:01.560]  life so you better say two plus two equals five or whatever else we want that's the psychological
[51:01.560 --> 51:09.280]  tactic here so I'm attacked in thousands of publications saying Jones made it up and said
[51:09.280 --> 51:17.400]  that the FBI staged the Pulse nightclub attack no I didn't know I didn't know I didn't the
[51:17.400 --> 51:22.600]  FBI came out and leaked that they were ordered to stand down just like in San Bernardino before
[51:22.600 --> 51:28.480]  that the FBI two agents one a federal FBI agent another a federal marshal were under
[51:28.480 --> 51:33.760]  criminal investigation two years before San Bernardino attack on the Christmas party by
[51:33.760 --> 51:47.720]  two jihadis for investigating the mosque and those two going to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
[51:47.720 --> 51:50.920]  so how do you spend it when the FBI comes out and says we're being ordered to stand
[51:50.920 --> 51:55.840]  down you just say Alex Jones says the FBI did it you lie about it you try to shut him
[51:55.840 --> 52:03.680]  down that's how they counter this but oh sorry sorry father of pulse gunman was FBI informant
[52:03.680 --> 52:08.880]  widow's attorney say so was the shooter pulse's gunman father was an FBI informant under criminal
[52:08.880 --> 52:16.240]  investigation oh see under criminal investigation the FBI was ordered to stand down and you
[52:16.240 --> 52:22.120]  can read the article where they were investigating and Obama's Justice Department killed it and
[52:22.120 --> 52:28.440]  then Omar Mateen's father is so arrogant he put out YouTube videos calling for killing
[52:28.440 --> 52:33.800]  gays calling for jihad and then his son goes and does it and he's got the nerve to show
[52:33.800 --> 52:39.400]  up at a Hillary Clinton event and stand behind her as a symbol of the other jihadis that
[52:39.400 --> 52:46.800]  you can trust Hillary we're okay they're still on our side that was all a message to an individual
[52:46.800 --> 52:51.920]  that all the evidence points towards being some type of multinational intelligence asset
[52:51.920 --> 52:57.920]  umar Mateen's father and then umar Mateen part of the international mercenary police group
[52:57.920 --> 53:04.400]  one of the largest in the world and then we don't even say we know what happened we just
[53:04.400 --> 53:11.600]  say it should be investigated and we're the bad guys that's why they want us shut down
[53:11.600 --> 53:20.400]  you cannot make up stuff this crazy like the top investigator for the Seth rich investigation
[53:20.400 --> 53:25.360]  shot twice in the back and run over with his dog he lives they grabbed the guy that did
[53:25.360 --> 53:30.480]  it he's a 40 something year old marine assigned to national security at the department of
[53:30.480 --> 53:35.800]  energy you can't make that when a government hit man comes that's exactly what it's like
[53:35.800 --> 53:39.960]  they got some cutout job at the department of energy or another place like that they
[53:39.960 --> 53:47.160]  get activated they come Seth rich gets shot in the back you investigate you get shot
[53:47.160 --> 53:54.520]  in the back move along move along move along nothing to see here nothing to see here nothing
[53:54.520 --> 54:01.320]  to see here all right I haven't gotten to Russia yet and China involved in all of our microchips
[54:01.320 --> 54:05.680]  all of our telecoms they could flip a switch it's mainstream news and turn all our telephones
[54:05.680 --> 54:11.000]  off all emergency everything but but rush is the problem because they say they nerve
[54:11.000 --> 54:18.320]  gas somebody with no evidence okay boy I wish that was our problem Mike Cernovich is coming
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.080]  up he's got a ton of stuff to cover I'm gonna get into the clips I said out there this segment
[54:22.080 --> 54:24.640]  but I didn't have time to get to him where they're putting all the violence they want
[54:24.640 --> 54:29.000]  to do to us and how they're gonna take our guns and just this boiling fascist group of
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.560]  leftist that are anti-gun anti-free speech out beating people up all over the streets
[54:33.560 --> 54:38.080]  thank God we got a second amendment for times such as this when this country's in deep deep
[54:38.080 --> 54:44.440]  deep deep crisis and Trump is starting to go sideways in some ways under incredible
[54:44.440 --> 54:48.920]  pressure he's gotten so much done as well but he's starting to become hit or miss under
[54:48.920 --> 54:55.080]  massive attack so we can bitch and complain all day about the omnibus spending packages
[54:55.080 --> 54:59.080]  but my point is let's move on and get better people elected to Congress because that's
[54:59.080 --> 55:02.520]  where the problem started and let's understand they're trying to steal elections all over
[55:02.520 --> 55:06.080]  this country and they're pouring in foreign money and they're doing it all right now
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.200]  and Trump's counting on the people to be rallied and to be strong and to realize we
[55:10.200 --> 55:15.320]  just started the war to take this country back and it's not gonna be a cakewalk it's
[55:15.320 --> 55:22.640]  not a joke this isn't a game they're not libtards folks they're hardcore criminals on top with
[55:22.640 --> 55:27.400]  a bunch of dumbed down mindless alone people that are scared and desperate who think they're
[55:27.400 --> 55:33.000]  gonna become successful as soon as they get your guns and run your life now as I said
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.560]  earlier this is so important for funding the operation plus you've never tried it I think
[55:36.560 --> 55:39.840]  once you try it you're gonna love it because we went out and studied the top new tropics
[55:39.840 --> 55:45.080]  in the country that are fifty sixty seven dollars we knew they were jacking up their

[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.200]  You know I'm kind of bouncing off the walls here behind the scenes because to me this
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:50.000]  is an act I'm genuinely upset and the globalist and George Soros are so evil this is so manufactured
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.120]  it's so fake they've tried to silence my free speech for a month
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.640]  Building up for this assault on the Second Amendment and to build this pressure to take
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.560]  our guns and then I don't even care about the guns themselves compared to what it means
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:09.840]  once they're gone and the tyranny and the oppression and how everywhere the Democrats
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:15.320]  are in control everywhere that they're in charge everywhere that they're running the
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:22.560]  system creates a nightmare of collapsing buildings drug addicts everywhere zombie looking people
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:28.240]  everywhere and that's what they want
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:34.320]  Delaney tar is one of the four horsemen of the Second Amendment's apocalypse I know
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:41.080]  Mike Adams is setting up hogwash or hog watch to track everything that Mr. Hogs up to and
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:47.480]  you know here she is coming out saying we want the guns and then we've got campus reform
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.360]  where they go hey whatever assault weapons are ban them all and we've got other people
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:56.480]  saying we're gonna kill the gun owners if they don't turn their guns in look we know
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.000]  that's what it's about it's about wimps getting together in big armies and taking our lives
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:09.480]  over here it is there are so very many things so many steps to take like right now sign
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:15.120]  our petition it takes two seconds and it matters we will take the big and we will take the
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.680]  small but we will keep fighting when they give us that inch that bump stock ban we will take
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.960]  a mile we are not here for breadcrumbs we are here for real change
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:32.720]  you know I think I'm gonna intro every segment in the rest of the broadcast today with that
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.560]  and then we could edit that together in with the sheriff's candidate saying we're gonna
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.400]  kill the gun owners they don't turn them in and then the signs where they said that out
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:46.960]  there and then we'll edit that into hogs saying we're shaking in our boots so we'll edit her
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.240]  in with the candidate saying we're gonna kill the gun owners and then we'll let that into
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:59.680]  hogs saying they're shaking in their boots no actually the establishment are the ones
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.720]  shaking in their boots because we awakened and that's why they're spending billions of
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:09.080]  dollars creating synthetic astroturf that you're witnessing right now with the march
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:14.120]  to destroy our lives here's campus reform I'm Kevin Phillips with campus reform today
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.000]  we're in Washington DC at the march for our lives protest we're talking to attendees about
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.880]  what they want to see and when they talk about banning assault weapons do they know what assault
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.880]  weapons are let's find out what sort of policy changes would you like to see it acted I think
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:32.920]  they need to be a complete ban on assault weapons we need laws in place that are going to prevent
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.760]  people from marketing into schools with assault rifles yeah I think there definitely needs
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:42.000]  to be a ban on these assault rifles so any banning of any guns I would be supportive of to give
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.120]  up some rights to have assault rifles it's like a higher priority than people losing
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.640]  their lives assault weapons are not necessary for home defense they're not necessary for
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.400]  the average citizen to have what laws you would you like to see what kind of guns would
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:02.800]  you like to see banned just assault rifles who would support the ban of assault weapons
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.400]  moving forward how many of you would support banning the sale of assault weapons moving
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.440]  forward okay so five out of five for banning an assault weapon do you know what a assault
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:17.160]  weapon is now they're the earlier phase they're just getting them ready to ban something and
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.400]  now she's there introducing Delaney tar the next phase is ban everything so again this
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:29.240]  is all been done other countries it's a formula here it is there are so very many things so
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:36.600]  many steps to take like right now sign our petition it takes two seconds and it matters
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.840]  we will take the big and we will take the small but we will keep fighting when they
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:46.520]  give us that inch that bump stock ban we will take a mile we are not here for breadcrumbs
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.200]  we are here for real change that's right you're not here for breadcrumbs you want to take
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.280]  the whole right the countries found it on and you want our free speech we get it well
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:59.560]  guess what it's not happening sister we'll be right back after being sold out for months

[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:35.240]  texas comments in the heart of the resistance it's alex jones so delaney tar is one of the
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.320]  original four horsemen of the george soros second amendment apocalypse there the four
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.040]  students chosen out of the three thousand because their anti-gun their parents are anti-gun
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.680]  they were put on airplanes and flown around the country put on every TV show you can imagine
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:57.040]  to push for gun control then soros the democrats openly through the women's march funded this
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:03.920]  weekend's march to destroy america's future known as march for our lives where they're
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.080]  not talking about the stand down the sheriff's department in coward county they're not talking
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:15.080]  about how repeatedly the supposed shooter had been on psychotropic and been adjudicated
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:20.880]  to have no right to own guns they never talked about any of that instead they said all gun
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:26.440]  owners are to blame you're guilty you're bad and if you tell us hey young adults who are
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:32.560]  public figures we disagree with that your band of twitter facebook or youtube for criticizing
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:37.040]  them because they are just coming for your second amendment of course they're coming
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:42.720]  for your first as well that's what always happens in history with this formula and there
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:50.760]  is a formula of gun control from australia to the uk to germany to france to the netherlands
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:55.760]  to mexico to brazil if you go back in the last hundred years everywhere it starts we
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:00.240]  just don't want you having military weapons well guns are there to protect yourself from
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:07.200]  criminals in government hunting is secondary then once they get the semi auto then they
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:14.280]  start taking everything and finally the shotguns and so diane feinstein michael more all the
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.200]  usual suspects the violence policy center the bloomberg group they've all said they
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:24.880]  want the civilian abolition of firearms ownership the official u n treaty that obama signed
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:31.440]  was never ratified by congress the small arms treaty says since july 17 2000 it's been
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:36.240]  re-upped each each year it's passed around the world as more countries sign on you look
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:43.680]  it up online that the civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.440]  of the state now a power monopoly of the state is called a dictatorship it's called a police
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:55.040]  state it's called authoritarianism police state it doesn't mean cops are bad it means
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.160]  you've got no rights the left always goes oh you hate cops when i said i want a police
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:04.160]  state no that means arbitrarily i have no rights the government has all the rights there's
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:11.240]  no balance of power so they said that civilian ownership of firearms is a quote quote begins
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:17.000]  civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:24.360]  and therefore it needs to be abolished by treaty by law and by military and police enforcement
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:32.520]  close quote exact quote from the treaty implementation papers that are the codex of how it will be
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:43.240]  implemented now guess who went to the un to actually dig that up in 2001 guess who went
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.040]  and writes for the new american magazine and publish it bob daisy my old good buddy i haven't
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.720]  been on here in years you get bob daisy back at studio bob daisy went he went to the un
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.960]  he got the documents and he actually published that so we'd even know it because guess what
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.360]  the un will put out a statement but they keep their implementation document secret it's
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:06.000]  like the un has 31 articles of universal rights but when you read article 30 and 31 it says
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:14.680]  all those rights are waived if the un feels like it so you need to go read it for yourself
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:20.160]  civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state well
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:26.000]  i say a power monopoly of the state can go right to hell now say tongue understood it
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.800]  political power grows out of what political power grows out of the barrel of a gun and
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.640]  so you get the media and the hype and the big public schools and you get four students
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.200]  all over the news you say kids are against guns and then you push them out there and
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:49.800]  you've been a bunch of old washed up hollywood stars to create this image they've taken
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.880]  most of guns in south africa now the genocides have begun there dan lineman article news
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:11:04.120]  wars dot com right now but let's go back to delaney tar and this formula first they don't
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:09.320]  let you give guns to family or have private sales so that when you die you can't transfer
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.760]  your firearms or you can't give your grandson a firearm that's the gun show loophole they
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.920]  want to get rid of then they banned semi auto always calling it a machine gun but it means
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:25.720]  all semi auto then they ban bolt action then they ban shotguns but first they make you put
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.680]  the shotguns in a hunting club and your guns are at a hunting club but then there'll always
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.720]  be some nut that checks them out and does something so then that's banned and then your country
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:38.120]  descends into hell on earth and the globalist loot the daylight side of it because they
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.880]  don't want free market this is the exact formula and now delaney tar the videos up on info wars
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:50.680]  dot com in an article tells us exactly what she wants this video needs to go viral to
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.400]  the four corners of the earth thousands of signs saying the same thing ban all guns we're
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:00.920]  going to kill you and take your guns this is what they're doing this is their move this
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:06.000]  is their plan and she sits there in the exact same get up by the way i've been in hollywood
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.680]  movies i've been around it i'm not saying they weren't the school i'm not saying shootings
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.200]  didn't happen but the democrats are funding this it's all scripted you've got the hispanic
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.760]  girl with a shaved head and the kind of the military outfit and you've got hog and his
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.720]  little outfit and you've got this other little madonna look with the other girl and you can
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.140]  and it's the same events the same women's march that funded madonna the day after trump
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:30.440]  got elected saying i want to blow the white house up i was there videotaping and i was
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:39.920]  there it's she there she is in the same little get up the same production crew the same operation
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:46.640]  the women's march funded by soros is the main funder and organizer of this same people same
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.800]  deal same operation and what do they want your guns they say you give us an inch we'll
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:13:00.880]  take it a mile it's not an inch to ban private sales that is that is registration by fiat
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.200]  and then you don't let people have them if they're semi auto and then you ban people
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:12.680]  until 21 even being part of the shooting sports this is a forum y'all up this is a program
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:18.120]  and it's got me angry i told you when trump got elected this meant the big assault was
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:28.680]  about to start because people go back to sleep and then they'd come so here is delaney tar
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:36.120]  are so very many things so many steps to take like right now sign our petition it takes
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:40.960]  two seconds and it matters we will take the big and we will take the small but we will
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:46.960]  keep fighting when they give us that inch that bump stock ban we will take a mile we
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.800]  are not here for breadcrumbs we are here for real change we are not here for breadcrumbs
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.560]  we are here for real change to have the second amendment to the country destroyed now we've
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.680]  got all the clips of them saying that that's an hog that we're shaking on our boots but
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:05.880]  let's hear from madonna 15 months earlier in the same park at the same mall financed
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:19.920]  by the same group with the same podium saying this i'm angry yes i am outraged yes i have
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:30.760]  thought an awful lot about blowing up the white house but i know that this won't change
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:43.600]  anything we cannot fall into despair as the poet w.h. odden once wrote on the eve of world
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:57.480]  war two we must love one another or die i choose love are you with me she choose love but let's
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.720]  blow up the white house and congressman are getting shot and all the rest of it it's always
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.720]  cute when that happens right or when the globalists find the arab spring and millions die and

[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:30.540]  with world government with people that want to take all your basic rights your right to

[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:41.860]  that is their sworn stated goal and then you see the mobs of leftist and you go on to major
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:48.420]  university campuses i look at old photos of people i don't care they're black or white
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:52.820]  i think what people used to look like just thirty years ago and they had lighten their
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:58.020]  eyes they had fire in their eyes all of us look unhealthy compared to where we used to
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:03.300]  look but you go to slitterbond or something and i mean it looks like day of the dead it
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:12.500]  looks like a bunch of undead reanimated walruses and you just see the young people all there
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:17.700]  on is their smartphones and the iq is lowering and cancer is exploding and the brainwaves
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:24.700]  are low and people don't pay attention and we're in crisis and the globalist are the
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:29.940]  authors of ninety percent of it and the other ten percent they're helping make as bad as
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:38.460]  they can and they believe humanities failed they believe humanities over and everywhere
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:46.460]  the left is violent and hateful and bullying and aggressive and creating a spirit of assault
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:55.820]  and a spirit of confrontation and a spirit of war against the american people i'm not
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.900]  going to play what i played last week probably ten times the three different congressmen
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:05.660]  saying use the second amendment against trump overthrow trump time to take trump out the
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:11.900]  attacks republican congressmen getting shot republican members of city council neighbors
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:16.620]  walk over and shoot them in the head ran paul getting attacked the leptis media saying too
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:22.580]  bad he didn't take ran paul out the dumb left and even know that ran paul is one of trump's
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:30.820]  biggest critics in many cases they just don't differentiate anything ran paul is more anti
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:37.900]  war than any democrat in congress they don't care they just want to hate people and they
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:43.740]  have whipped them up into an absolute frenzy and then i see this weird scummy ne'er do
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:54.460]  well individual running for sheriff daryl fisher in north carolina rattling off i mean we've
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:58.140]  got hundreds of these videos and i've got people threatening owens shroyer in austin
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.820]  and following around for two hours trying to tell him he can't videotape or talk to
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:07.140]  people they don't agree with his first woman either but these are as a bunch of soft thugs
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:11.420]  that we've all let push us around so long that they think it's time for them to go ahead
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:18.300]  and just fully take over so let's hear from this piece of trash daryl fisher that thinks
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:25.940]  that we don't turn our guns in we just have to die from my cold dead hand to quote charleston
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:35.620]  haston doesn't this fool know that they're going down the same road the british should
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:40.980]  get less than a concord here it is first off i would like to see the age for purchase
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:45.620]  of any firearm raised at twenty one i think that we should ban the sale of all high capacity
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:50.900]  magazines handguns and long guns i think we need to ban the sale of any mechanism that
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:57.620]  will allow a firearm to fire in rapid succession any weapon that's designed for use by the military
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:02.300]  i think we should ban you've heard people say you'll have to pry my gun from my cold
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:12.120]  dead hand okay okay you think if he was the sheriff it'd be like broward county coward
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:17.060]  county where they'd stand down and then blame the second amendment where they wouldn't busting
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:26.260]  when he was supposedly not supposed to have a gun you think so that's exactly the types
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:30.900]  that run blue areas where they always stand down and where the mass shooters always come
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:34.460]  where they're always magically allowed to do what they want just like the lawsuit against
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:42.100]  me from virginia and the news article said that i said that umar matine was a federal
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:47.020]  informant and then i made that up turns out him and his daddy were both fat and it's just
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:53.860]  come out the trial of his widow that the feds use the evidence they had that they were tracking
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:59.500]  them and trying to stop them but the justice department ordered them to stand down in the
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:07.180]  criminal investigation of his shine and remember he's the one that showed up the father the
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:17.020]  federal informant behind the video camera there with hillary clinton at that rally
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:23.180]  motion reveals pulse dunman's father was fbi informant who shot videos calling for the
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:35.820]  death of gaze reportedly and we reported that back when it happened in 2016 and now the democratic
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:41.460]  party is suing me through georgetown university and their first amendment clinic and the lawyers
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:45.580]  have never seen a first amendment clinic sue to end the first amendment and it actually
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:53.940]  does that so i'm lucky though the investigator into seth rich just got shot twice in the back
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:58.540]  and run over by car and it barely made the news but by the grace of god he survived people
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:05.220]  get shot in the back for this folks hillary and the globalists have taken their gloves
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:11.620]  off well you know what i've taken mine off in the info war and i believe in god i believe
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:15.820]  in providence i believe in you now i feel sorry for the crew around here because i'm

[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:52.740]  like they stood down in coward county nearby so the shooting should happen in another blue
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:40:02.500]  state cesshole another blue abscess another blue cancer i want to get your take on the
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:07.700]  biggest assault on the second amendment we've ever seen the democrats now admit on cnbc abc
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:12.140]  the wall street journal the new york times the associated press the speeches yesterday
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:18.580]  saturday they want a total global gunband that's what the un wants that's the plan total
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:22.780]  control where only the megastate has the weapons it's a simple equation it's why we have the
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:26.900]  second amendment now we got a lot of mentally ill people and police that stand down all
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:32.140]  over the country every time there's a mass shooting in a red area the person gets killed
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:37.860]  in a minute and a half or shorter because they got people hired there that want to defend
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:42.820]  people most police are incredibly competent and honorable men and women who got into it
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:46.420]  because they care about what they're doing just like the average citizen's a hard charger
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:53.500]  americans love to fight we're not cowards every red area they start a mass shooting in minutes
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:41:03.860]  the piece of crap's dead i don't care if it's texas were some guy in a mental institution
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:08.580]  who wasn't even supposed to have guns escapes the mental institution the air force doesn't
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:13.180]  file the paperwork he goes and shoots up a church and then patriots outside start shooting
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:18.060]  at him and chase him down and kill his ass get her to hammer within two minutes that's
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:22.740]  texas but that's the same all over this country if citizens feel like they've got a right
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:28.540]  to stand up and do something and that's what the second amendment's about the 99.99999%
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:33.820]  of us of every race color and creed that don't want to go shoot up a school or shoot up a
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:38.060]  church but just want to live our lives and we got firearms because there's a bunch of
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:43.260]  crazy scumbags out there and we're not going to roll over to them and then a nazi war criminal
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:49.140]  piece of crap like george soros is hell bent on overthrowing this country and sure before
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:53.580]  he dies he'll finally break the will of this nation and have his big leftist persecution

[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:51.620]  you're listening to alex jones show more than a year and a half ago when omar matine went and
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:58.500]  shot up that pulse nightclub and killed what was it 50 something people in florida the media
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:02.580]  came out and demonized anybody that said that there was reports of a stand down there had been
[01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:08.260]  warnings but i remember then it came out that he'd been an fbi informant now the feds are saying the
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:13.620]  father was the full informant and the son was only involved with the fbi being looked at as an
[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:19.940]  informant the point is we've been proven right yet again and they hope nobody looks at that
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:23.620]  just like they don't want anybody looking at seth rich and the chief investigator used to
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:30.180]  work for the family just got shot in the back twice and run over lived the cops caught the guy
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:36.420]  and he was a marine 40 something years old assigned to special security unit of the department of
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:43.380]  energy and that's exactly how it works in the military people graduate if they're
[01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:51.860]  general enlisted and and not a commissioned officer into other agencies and you've got these
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:56.100]  guys embedded everywhere from the reams the army you name it and they go do the little
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:49:02.740]  special jobs so it's the exact type of guy you'd expect from a cutout group to go do assassinations
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:07.940]  it's exactly who does it and then he's shot in the back and no it's no big deal
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:14.420]  we've got my son who is coming on he loves taking calls i want to take your calls on the march what
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:21.380]  we do how we take action and on the whole russia situation that i'm going to get more into as well
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:24.900]  i don't get into the russia thing when they call me a russian or they call roger stone
[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:29.620]  everybody's tone deaf to that everybody's sick of it they know it's not true but when they launch
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:34.820]  big sanctions on russia or kick your diplomats out with no proof and escalate new cold wars
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:40.100]  and trump starts giving in to all this it's a bad thing especially when the communist chinese
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:45.940]  have infiltrated us thousands and thousands of times the russians i mean if the russians were
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:50.660]  in our business i've never been to russia i'm not on russian payroll i don't give a flying you know
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:58.260]  what if they were still communist but no it's all a canard by the globalists that are the outside
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:02.260]  globalists so they need some outside power to point at so that we don't see that they're the outside
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:09.860]  power and we have the us ambassador here saying the people were expelling our intelligence operatives
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:14.340]  or intelligence agencies no they're not their diplomats are some of them probably double agents
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:20.180]  or probably in that capacity yes but they're just getting rid of the diplomatic corps which is never
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:25.540]  a good idea they don't want communication between us and russia when you start expelling diplomats
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:32.020]  that's the first move towards war then sanctions then blockades then taking part of ukraine
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:36.580]  overthrowing the government that's what george soros is doing we face the same enemy here it is
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:43.060]  today president trump announced the expulsion of dozens of russian intelligence officers
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:48.980]  from the united states along with the closure of its consulate in seattle washington this is
[01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:55.220]  the largest expulsion of russian intelligence officers in united states history the united
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:51:01.140]  states takes this action in conjunction with our nato allies and partners around the world
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:08.020]  in response to a military-grade chemical weapon attack on the soil of the united kingdom by russia
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:14.820]  and yet the latest in a pattern of destabilizing activities around the world today's actions
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:20.660]  make the united states a safer place by limiting the ability of russia to spy on americans and
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:28.100]  conduct covert activities that threaten america's national security with these actions the united
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:35.380]  states along with its allies and partners make clear to russia that its actions have consequences
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:42.260]  well that's enough of that that's enough of that uh that's uh john huntsman whose daughter famously
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:47.700]  on pierce morgan the night after i was on there in 2013 called for me to be shot she said alex
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:53.940]  jones needs to be shot and killed and she went on to say pierce you could wear a uniform while
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:52:02.020]  you did it she fetishizes it uh so that just is a little side tidbit uh about who these people are
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:06.340]  and what they stand for now let me get the number out here the toll-free number for you to join us
[01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:13.780]  is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:19.540]  alex first time callers please have a good strong phone that's all i ask and have your points ready
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:23.780]  on the russia situation whether you agree with me disagree i want to hear it we don't screen your
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:28.340]  calls just have a point have a clear phone you're on the air and what do you think about this giant
[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:33.620]  assault on the second amendment where they now are like yeah we're going to take your guns yeah
[01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:38.100]  we're going to kill you if you don't turn them in yeah we're coming for you they mean business
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:42.820]  what are we going to do about this and thanks to trump the republicans have raised more money
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:50.100]  than democrats but those big packs are sitting on it they should be financing big marches they
[01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:55.140]  should be getting people galvanized they should be striking back but most of them are like huntsmen
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:53:01.380]  these neocon liberals who are not really conservatives and that's our problem and it's
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:07.300]  that same republican blue blood operation that passed that giant pork barrel omnibus bill
[01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:13.540]  wrapping the defense spending and giant buckets of pork and trump i saw one editorial had like
[01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:19.620]  the komayashi maru wrath of consenario uh where if he killed it would make the economy go down
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:23.780]  they would just pass it back again later or he could just put the pressure on them and say it's
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:28.660]  their fault i don't agree with it but i'm going to sign it everybody's still so upset about that
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:33.780]  because you can grandstand and twitter and facebook will let you spread your articles and videos
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:38.340]  give you attack trump i'm not saying and people that attack trump are wrong i'm not saying they're
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:42.900]  morally and you know not allowed to say that because i've got problems but when people get
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:50.340]  hysterical about what trump did get as hysterical about congress that actually passed it and realize
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:55.140]  the day before he put big tariffs on china who's that's what's really screwing us over and the
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:59.940]  tax cuts and uh the reform and the trillions and trillions of the stock market and the hundreds of
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:06.340]  billions uh coming in for new jobs the two million new jobs on on on trump overall is a god's sin
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:12.900]  that's why they're trying to remove him but if his constituents fall asleep if we go to bed
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:18.580]  if we stop supporting if we stop keeping his feet to the fire he will move to the center
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:25.780]  that's the way politics works and ladies and gentlemen the democrats will win the house coming
[01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:31.540]  up this year and the impeachment proceedings will start so remember we're not staring down
[01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:37.300]  the barrel of hillary clinton right now but let me tell you we have stirred up these criminals
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.980]  they thought they had the country on its knees they thought they were invincible they thought
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:46.980]  they were unstoppable and now they are moving against us big time so
[01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:56.260]  they see the nra an info wars and the free press is their biggest enemy they hate the drudge report
[01:54:56.260 --> 01:55:03.460]  they hit the nra they hate info wars because they know we've never compromised and they want to
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:08.900]  intimidate the nra into bowing but thanks to gun owners of america and all of you out there keep
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:15.140]  modest we have the gun culture growing we have the cultural self-reliance growing in the face of
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:20.260]  the domesticated masses and a growing remnant of people are spreading the word and that's why
[01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:25.540]  the globalists are now going to throw everything to to the wind caution to the wind and they are
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:33.860]  going to go all out against us to bring in total tyranny and that's why on facebook on twitter on
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:38.980]  youtube on your own websites your own platforms you've got to get political as a way of stopping
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:43.860]  total physical civil war and economic collapse if people don't get motivated if they don't get
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:49.860]  active if they don't get involved the globalist plan to bring us into a depression to break our
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:56:00.500]  will will succeed this is a maximum red alert now i've got the big russian news i've got more
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:04.740]  of the gun grabbing clips i i have even scratched the surface on a bunch of other information here
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:10.820]  but we're fighting for our basic rights we're seeing this giant organized globalist criminal
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:16.020]  syndicate moving against the people while the communist chinese are giving the keys to apple
[01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:21.460]  the keys to google the keys to satellites the keys to all the emergency phones that is in the news
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:27.860]  today that's coming up next hour as well jason tim elissa jeremy your calls as well mike sernovich
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:35.620]  you name it briefly we hardly ever do this 50 percent off our best-selling product brain force
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:40.740]  so many of you love it if you haven't tried it at 1995 it is very close close to a lost leader
[01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:46.500]  leading new tropics that are similar formulas are 60 70 dollars as they mark them up five to seven
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:52.500]  times we don't do that it normally is marked up 150 percent right now it's only marked up
[01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:57.780]  not even quite 50 percent it's like 40 percent so we're barely making any money on this but i want
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:02.260]  you to see how great it is and the real red pill has been sold out it's back in stock it's got a

[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:11.220]  else works better find out about the real red pill it's 50 percent off never never been a better
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:15.620]  chance to try brain force you've heard all about it read the reviews info or store dot com
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:22.100]  info or slife dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine and you stand against the
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:26.580]  globals you're the reason we're here you see them all freaking out about us everywhere playing clips
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:33.140]  of me at their gun grabbing soros march their anti-america march is because they know we're away

[01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:42.340]  houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back
[01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:54.900]  it's been sold out for months and now it's back it's michael zx plus lower price more ingredients
[01:58:54.900 --> 01:59:01.300]  because we scaled up signed to your contract with even bigger organic manufacturer and producer
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:08.900]  scalability but now we're able to go at 50 off to $27 instead of $39 50 off because there's a lot
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:13.300]  of product and a lot of ingredient michael zx now it's the other side of the equation everybody
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:17.460]  thinks about probiotics now great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment
[01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:23.140]  pesticides herbicides but more importantly than bad bacteria the probiotics help this place yeast
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:29.940]  mold create slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there
[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:35.460]  it causes all sorts of psoriasis well this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:40.660]  known to destroy that slime wall don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:46.340]  pick up a bottle of the new and improve michael zx plus now from the info wars store
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:53.940]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:59:53.940 --> 02:00:14.500]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report it's alex jones
[02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:20.420]  all right my son of which is coming up we're gonna have phone calls while he's on
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:28.340]  do you believe the media a month ago tried to ban info wars saying that we set the democrats
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:33.700]  were funding these young high school students to be anti-gun which is all admitted and now we see
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:40.660]  these huge rallies saying we're gonna take all your guns and david hall goes f all you old people
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:48.980]  and we're taking over and then youtube takes down videos of him talking like that to watch the media
[02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:56.260]  the internet censoring and live time with the memory hold is amazing and then separately china
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:01:01.540]  flies bombers near taiwan his military tensions ramp up turns out china is in control of our
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:07.700]  telecommunications that trump's launching all this stuff with 14 other countries against russia
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:14.260]  with no proof because two people got nerve-gassed i mean the germans did sink the lucetania they
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:19.620]  get us into world war one but the lucetania was a weapons ship a passenger ship converted under
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:24.740]  military flag that sailed back and forth in front of the u-boats the germans put full page ads
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:29.940]  when the new york times and the times of london saying don't sail on this ship we're going to sink
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:36.340]  it but that got us into world war one at least the germans at least sank the ship in this case
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:40.820]  they don't even say there's proof the russians killed these people or nerve gas these people
[02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:48.500]  so jason tim elissa jeremy we're going to go to all of you right now let's go ahead and go to
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:54.900]  jason in canada you're on the air what do you think about all this i think uh trump has a lot of
[02:01:55.700 --> 02:02:01.940]  power to change the narrative on this is there any way you know he could uh you know he could
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:06.980]  launch an investigation on the fbi and and all the all the things that were misleading up to the
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:11.300]  ship well he's been asking the justice department to do it that's the agency that does it and and
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:17.300]  they've been kind of refusing the inspector general starting to yeah the doj's been a big
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:22.660]  disappointment so here's the problem and it's also a good thing everything in our government's
[02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:26.900]  a paradox everything in our government separation of power so one group doesn't get too much power
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:31.220]  get out of control because historically our founders knew that was the problem so each agency
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:37.220]  or each segment bounds down the other the democrats and the globalists went totally rogue and then
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:42.020]  conservatives will never come in against that robeness and they're all under checks and balances
[02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:46.580]  so because the democrats and the deep state are so criminal it's hard to move against them because
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:52.500]  we'll never act like they do do you see what i'm saying yeah and if i could just make a couple
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:58.900]  other quick points alex yes sir one is uh it'd be nice to hear um you know if trump kind of
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:04.180]  acknowledged the the independent media and their role in this and all the progress that's been made
[02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:10.180]  and you they could even memorialize uh the idea of fake news so it would just haunt them
[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:15.220]  every single year and you could you could put it on the same day that that rockfeller spoke to
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:22.340]  all the news media it was like back in the 50s when he thanked them for basically keeping the
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:28.660]  public ignorant well it was it was 1991 in avian france and he thanked the new york times washington
[02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:32.420]  post and all of them for keeping globalism secret and he said without them doing that would be
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:37.140]  impossible yeah put it on that date and memorialize it as fake news of where
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:46.260]  thing would be um innovation innovation's going to be a way out we got set up anti-cloud devices
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:53.060]  and technology to protect people protect people's privacy protect their data and give them a wall
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:59.860]  against uh no i agree everyone's got to go to the newer systems of it being decentralized
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:04.420]  everybody knows decentralization is the way to go centralization is the way of tyranny it's also

[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:24.980]  of course it's old news for our audience but the word was back at the time Omar Mateen
[02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:36.100]  and his father nor salam or for his father a separate man but his his widow nor salam trial
[02:06:36.100 --> 02:06:42.260]  all of this is coming out so back at the time we talked about the pulse nightclub shooter being
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:46.180]  connected to the FBI and his father being an informant and he being an informant and now
[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:52.180]  that's coming out in the news. Omar Mateen's father was an FBI informant before pulse
[02:06:52.180 --> 02:07:00.660]  nightclub shooting and that's the big conspiracy theory that I supposedly push and that I supposedly
[02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:08.580]  made up well now it's CBS news a year and a half later now it's the Orlando Sentinel
[02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:12.740]  now it's New York Daily News
[02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:21.780]  now it's CNN pulse government's father was an FBI informant under criminal investigation
[02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:23.940]  attorney say
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:35.380]  and now they want a mistrial in the widow of his daughter-in-law the wife of the reported
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:42.420]  shooter Omar Mateen that came out in the local news at the time see here's why they hate him
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:46.740]  full wars here's why they hate Mike Cernovich here's why they hate drudge report more than anything
[02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:53.140]  is because it'll come out on local news a document a video a photo it's confirmed
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:59.060]  but CNN MSNBC all the usual suspects they would ignore that before
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:07.460]  but then we'll take something they don't want seen we'll put it out they go oh it's a conspiracy
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:12.180]  jones says their FBI informants even though I didn't get that out of the clear blue sky I didn't
[02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:19.540]  make that up it was in the local Orlando newspaper how long ago was the Orlando shooting almost
[02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:23.380]  a year and three quarters ago it was about a year and three quarters ago
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:30.020]  and that's what's so mind-blowing about all this is
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:39.300]  it's in the lawsuit the democrats filed through Georgetown University that never happens
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:45.140]  it says in the lawsuit amongst other things that I made up that Omar Mateen and his father
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:52.500]  were federal informants for the FBI the FBI was ordered to stand down that was in the Orlando
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:58.260]  newspaper at the time that they were reportedly informants and that the FBI had them under
[02:08:58.260 --> 02:09:05.460]  investigation so again they think you don't have a memory now riding shotgun with the rest of the
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:12.580]  hour and we'll take your phone calls is Mike Cernovich of Cernovich media he's been really upset
[02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:17.940]  about Trump and the ominous bill which I am as well but more mad at congress he's been really
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:24.020]  really upset about the fact that why don't the republicans that have raised even more money thanks
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:28.660]  to trump and the democrats why aren't they having buses why aren't they having demonstrations
[02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:33.860]  but also the Omar Mateen things come out you got Seth Rich investigator shot twice in the back
[02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:38.660]  regardless what you think about Seth Rich that's crazy you've got all this stuff happening
[02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:45.140]  and I want to get his take is politically where we are right now in the republic and
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:49.780]  why would the anti-gunners come out and say you give us an inch we take it a mile we do want to
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:53.940]  ban guns we're going to kill people that don't turn their guns in I mean the democrats they've
[02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:59.140]  gone to a new phase of calling for violence and really frothing and building up towards something
[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:04.580]  big is Soros crazy enough to actually try a physical overthrow like he's done successfully
[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:09.060]  in other countries Mike Cernovich good to have you on what do you want to tackle first yeah I mean
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:15.540]  I want to talk about why the media refused to cover an FBI informant who was plotting convicted
[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:21.860]  of plotting to murder Pamela Geller there was a big I mean I don't know Alex I'm just I'm really
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:27.460]  charged up today I'm going to try not to yell on air but Pamela Geller people tried to murder her
[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:32.180]  and yet the media attacked her because she's friends with John Bolton but they didn't cover the
[02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:38.820]  trial of the man in Cleveland who was an FBI informant who was then charged with being part of
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:43.700]  the Garland Texas murder plot and didn't folks even say where Geller's daughters lived who were
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:48.500]  apolitical and say go kill them I mean this is an example of leftist bullying against you I our
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:53.540]  families like you said they're trying to get people up to kill us and her daughters Pamela
[02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:59.060]  Geller is Jewish and her four young daughters are Jewish women who now are marked for death
[02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:03.780]  by the radical people who want to attack Geller and then the media goes you and I are in a
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:08.900]  Semitic and I go wait a minute I'm trying to protect four young Jewish women against jihadi
[02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:15.460]  terrorists that the media has sent on them so the whole thing is so freshering Alex and then
[02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:22.020]  this Omar Mateen thing breaks you and I I remember I was in New York at the time and I remember I got
[02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:26.500]  a tip and then you I talked to you and you said you got the same tip they said that Omar Mateen
[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:32.260]  was an FBI asset or connected to an FBI asset and then people go oh you're liar fake news
[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:36.580]  da da da da da well it turns out and I want to talk about this and I really want to lay it out
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:44.820]  for the people who listen because this story is about why they hate us you and I even though we
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:53.540]  don't join these groups we believe that in court black brown Jewish Muslim Christian Catholic
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:59.380]  agnostic no one should ever be convicted of a crime they did not commit however it was revealed
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:05.700]  that 12 days into the trial of Omar Mateen's wife that Omar Mateen's father who you can
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:11.060]  find a picture of him with the VIP seat at Hillary Clinton's rally you can find that
[02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:17.780]  Omar Mateen's father was an FBI asset not only was he an FBI asset but when people reported
[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:22.660]  Omar Mateen to the FBI and said hey this Omar Mateen guy says he has connections to Al Qaeda
[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:29.860]  and ISIS FBI though we're not going to do anything about it because we like his dad so much so if
[02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:36.580]  gay lives matter why did the FBI which had the power to stop this terrorist attack against gay
[02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:42.820]  people why did they not act if brown lives matter why is the Department of Justice in my opinion
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:48.980]  framing an innocent brown woman innocent Muslim woman Omar Mateen's wife went well to cover up
[02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:54.260]  that's the world we in Alex where you and I were actually trying to save every life every
[02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:59.460]  every person's life and we're standing up against this tyrannical unethical prosecutor but we're
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:06.500]  the bad guys so it's now proven the FBI could have under Mueller and Comey let's not forget either
[02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:12.580]  Comey and Mueller this was under their watch they now knew about Nicholas Cruz they knew about Omar
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:17.940]  Mateen and in my view they also knew about the Vegas shooting and that's why the Vegas shooting
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:22.900]  is not getting any traction that's right again Mike certain this is joining us you've got another
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:30.660]  cowardly blue state area coward county standing down 30 plus times it was 20 now it's 30 plus
[02:13:30.660 --> 02:13:34.420]  times that there were warnings things could have been done he should have been adjudicated to have
[02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:38.660]  his guns taken should have been able to buy and he was on psychotropic drugs he was under government
[02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:43.380]  care another government stand down the deputies stand down and then they turned it all around and
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:49.940]  blamed gun owners for what happened with 16 dead and then Soros funds this giant march with thousands
[02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:56.340]  of buses uh you know we have video on hundreds of buses just on one street this is so synthetic this
[02:13:56.340 --> 02:14:03.140]  is so fake this is so insane how they turned it around and blame us yeah they want to disarm gun
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:09.700]  owners but they don't want to hold the FBI couple and isn't that a good shift out isn't it interesting
[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:14.340]  how you and I a couple of white guys who are called all kinds of names by these groups
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:20.980]  why is the SPLC not standing up for Omar Mateen's wife and saying whoa whoa wait a minute it's
[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:27.700]  actually the deep state that is trying to frame an innocent woman in order to cover up their
[02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:32.420]  complicity in the pulse nightclub massacre which killed gay people right there's nobody from the
[02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:38.900]  SPLC the ADL the ACL you you and I and your listeners and my listeners and readers we're
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:44.660]  the only people left in America who actually cares about the civil rights and civil liberties of all
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:51.380]  Americans we really have gotten to that point where my lawyers look at these lawsuits against
[02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:56.740]  us they're totally fake they're not even lawsuits there's just screams of lies in there and they
[02:14:56.740 --> 02:15:01.460]  said they've never heard of major universities like Georgetown having their free speech division
[02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:06.180]  these are endowed set up groups with taxpayer money to defend the first amendment trying to
[02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:12.020]  destroy it but I think Mike that's because they're so desperate well and they are they're
[02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:17.780]  complicit again let's just look at the facts no conspiracy theories let's just look at the facts
[02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:24.500]  the facts are the FBI had advanced warning that Omar Mateen was a domestic terrorist that's a fact
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:30.900]  the FBI chose to do nothing they chose to not prosecute him even though he lied to them and
[02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:35.380]  thus could have been prosecuted like General Flynn was for obstructing justice the FBI had
[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:42.260]  advanced warning of Nicholas Cruz the FBI informant involved with the plot against Pamela Geller
[02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:50.260]  recently convicted so the facts are thus the FBI in the deep state could have stopped these attacks
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:56.500]  they haven't just like San Bernardino let's ask why on the other side attention business owners

[02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:33.700]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:48.340]  right now sign our petition it takes two seconds and it matters we will take the big
[02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:53.060]  and we will take the small but we will keep fighting when they give us that inch that bump
[02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:58.260]  stock ban we will take a mile we are not here for breadcrumbs we are here for real change
[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:05.220]  ladies and gentlemen we're back live mike cernes is here your phone call is coming up next segment
[02:21:05.220 --> 02:21:09.380]  i'm gonna get into russia with him as well and what trumps up to what his information is on what's
[02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:14.340]  happening inside the trump administration but you were getting into the incredible persecution
[02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:19.540]  of conservatives libertarians of just nationalists of just free speech activists you're a lawyer in
[02:21:19.540 --> 02:21:23.060]  your own right i know you've looked over some of the lawsuits against us and i'm not just
[02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:27.460]  putting a good face on it these will cost money we've got to beat them but my lawyers tell me
[02:21:27.460 --> 02:21:33.700]  some of the top guys in the country defamation wise they say we've never seen suits like these
[02:21:33.700 --> 02:21:39.060]  these are defamatory themselves but it's defamation protected by court because it's in a lawsuit
[02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:45.140]  and again they even say jones says that you know they were connected to the fbi uh that umar mattine
[02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:51.540]  was well that was in the news then it's in the news now so it's just next level this intimidation
[02:21:51.540 --> 02:21:57.620]  and where they're going and it makes me ask what's the next step uh just in the violent rhetoric
[02:21:57.620 --> 02:22:05.300]  and where are the republicans where is trump uh it's just crazy well i mean the next step is
[02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:10.260]  for them for us to be assassinated i mean there's no there's no nice way to put it
[02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:17.060]  we all know that the family research council shooting happened in 2013 a man floydley corkins
[02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:23.460]  went on to the splc target list website he went in to murder as many people this is what he said
[02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:29.220]  he said i want to kill as many people he said he said he wanted to kill as many people as possible
[02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:35.140]  and he said this to the fbi and the only reason he was stopped was by a good guy with the gun
[02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:41.860]  so the splc has actually directly in ways that you and i never have even though the fake news
[02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:46.900]  wants to say otherwise directly inside in a mass shooter media doesn't care they don't talk about
[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:53.060]  that they don't report that instead they'll docks for young jewish women because they don't like the
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:59.940]  mom pambla galler so i there's no way the left's always been dirty and bad worldwide and i thought
[02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:05.540]  that maybe they were nicer here but really it's just time in the phase for them to go into the red
[02:23:05.540 --> 02:23:13.700]  terror yeah i every day that i wake up is for me a relief that i haven't been i haven't been murdered
[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:18.260]  or targeted i because we i haven't targeted for assassination of course there's no question the
[02:23:18.260 --> 02:23:24.260]  family research council happened i mean if you if somebody said they went on our website and they
[02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:30.980]  clicked on a target list and they went to commit a shooting oh my god because they called it a
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:36.580]  targeting list for those that don't know yeah yeah so the splc literally has a target list and then
[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:42.180]  a man goes on a mass shooting the splc is never apologized to the victims they have not disavowed
[02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:46.740]  that shooting they try to pretend it doesn't happen and the media is complicit there are
[02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:54.500]  maybe four or five articles tops on it and they bury the lead about how that was a direct incitement
[02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:58.740]  by the southern poverty now the southern poverty law center had 10 000 people hired by youtube and
[02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:05.060]  google to censor us what do you make of that whole purge that's still ongoing well my youtube channel
[02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:13.620]  i was gaining 1500 new subscribers a day my videos were doing 20 000 views a day and now i actually
[02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:19.220]  hardly even do much on youtube because my videos are doing like 1500 views 2000 views because the
[02:24:19.220 --> 02:24:25.060]  splc has unsubscribed people and gutted my youtube channel they've already taken oh that's the thing
[02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:30.100]  our youtube channel was at over two billion it's now reversed to 1.5 and almost no one
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:34.260]  is getting our videos and they're all being unsubscribed so they've got to go keep subscribing
[02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:41.620]  every day yeah i actually this was last week i have 66 000 subscribers even after the unsubscribes
[02:24:41.620 --> 02:24:46.260]  i had three live viewers alex when i went did a live stream no no i saw you link to that show
[02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:51.460]  it that's impossible they're not even that means three people had to be on your youtube page to
[02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:56.500]  see it that's called shadow banning the you were that you were not able to hit any of the subscribers
[02:24:57.380 --> 02:25:01.540]  yeah and it's interesting and then i'll point that out and then suddenly like the next day
[02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:05.780]  then i'll get a couple hundred or something and then you know because they think that we're gonna
[02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:12.100]  forget about it not pay attention right so three three live viewers on a 66 000 subscriber channel
[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:18.420]  it just doesn't really add up so what they're doing is they're trying to play a scyop hey
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:22.820]  we're banned from our main channel from streaming still so at least you get your three and that's
[02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:27.540]  what i'm saying it's here folks it's here and it's the so-called left the champions of speech that
[02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:34.420]  are doing it yeah i actually unpublished every youtube video that i'd ever done because what
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:39.700]  they'd done is they went back to someone's channel he was actually um wane dupree african-american
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:45.300]  very powerful man powerful voice they found a video from four years ago so they're going through
[02:25:45.300 --> 02:25:50.820]  every video and watching every video with a fine tooth comb and if you say one wrong word or one
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:56.420]  foul language or you know there's a word that begins with c that was common during the election
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:26:00.980]  they've decided now that if you say anything like that even four years ago they'll ban you
[02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:05.140]  or they'll you know they'll suspend it so that that's where we are that's why i tell somebody
[02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:10.100]  ask you this because i'm asking a lot of questions what's on your radar what's next how'd the big gun
[02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:14.420]  grab march go yesterday i know you made the point where the republicans and the funding i mean
[02:26:14.420 --> 02:26:20.180]  this is the real fight this is bigger than the election 2016 people better understand that yeah
[02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:27.460]  it was a highly successful march and the left has shown that they can mobilize and organize and bust
[02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:34.500]  people in less than a month so if the democrats can get 800 000 people out into washington dc alone
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:40.900]  and they can have coordinated marches all throughout the country that shows that they can bust people
[02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:46.580]  in there is going to be a major blue wave in november there's no question about it the republicans
[02:26:46.580 --> 02:26:53.060]  don't want to win trump trump went on stage with charlie kerkin said oh and tifa is it really a big
[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:58.100]  deal you know who who oh that they just get too much attention despite the fact that multiple
[02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:02.900]  trump supporters have been assaulted and almost murdered and in fact that there's a pending criminal
[02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:08.820]  case in new york where an antifa terrorist attempted to murder he's charged with mob action
[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:15.300]  and was trying to strangle it oh no i saw i saw trump uh in that interview that he did
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:19.540]  and it was on fox last friday and i'm not trying to attack trump it's true they go
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:25.300]  you know we they really attack us on campus and we're being shut down nationwide our 20 000 campus
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:30.100]  groups trump goes yeah but you're still really popular the left nobody really agrees with them
[02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:34.980]  and and and the guest host is like no they're attacking us and shutting us down he's they're
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:40.340]  telling the president we're under attack we need federal funding to be pulled from these universities
[02:27:40.340 --> 02:27:44.900]  these universities are out of control saying no whites on the weekend no whites on the commons
[02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:51.220]  and it's weird white teachers leading this classic racism crap i mean trump have they compromised him
[02:27:51.220 --> 02:27:55.460]  because i gotta be honest here he's still doing a lot of great things but man i mean he is starting
[02:27:55.460 --> 02:28:01.860]  to really slide what in the hell is going on mike well i'll tell you the truth that nobody
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:07.060]  really wants to hear and it's cost me thousands of followers and i'm fine with that so i don't
[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:12.180]  want anybody to blame you for what i'm about to say but i'll just tell you the truth if alex baldwin
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:17.620]  makes fun of donald trump on saturday night live trump will tweet about it if a trump supporter
[02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:23.940]  and a trump hat is knocked unconscious trump says it's no big deal i just don't see him caring about
[02:28:23.940 --> 02:28:29.220]  the page caring about the patriots who are on the front lines really making things happen does he
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:33.220]  know how much those people love him and how important they are because i know for a fact he
[02:28:33.220 --> 02:28:40.100]  does i think he's in a bubble and doesn't know well i'm only gonna apologize for him for so much
[02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:44.500]  i'm i know i hear you well you know what you know what because it's fair to do let's look at the
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:47.940]  negative of a trump we come back and they go to phone calls because i because what i've been told
[02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:52.340]  is you've got to get on his butt and us just blindly supporting him makes him go to sleep so

[02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:16.660]  you
[02:33:17.620 --> 02:33:25.460]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live on the front lines of the info war
[02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:30.580]  all right we're going to your phone calls here in a few minutes mike sternum which is our guest but
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:38.900]  i'm very thankful for president trump i like the things he's done on nafta and gatt the tpp and
[02:33:38.900 --> 02:33:44.100]  tariffs on china and the four trillion the stock market the two million new jobs and i'm not going
[02:33:44.100 --> 02:33:50.100]  to go through that all take a long time but markedly in the last month i've seen some big changes but
[02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:55.060]  the big one isn't even that omnibus because he got handed that by congress that was stalled the whole
[02:33:55.060 --> 02:33:59.780]  government it's big pork barrel i'm not saying i absolve him but i understand why he did it
[02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:04.020]  because it's it's it's used the cheesy star trek it's like the kobe ishi maru saw an article where
[02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:09.940]  it's like there's no good choice probably the least of but but i get the principal choice still shut
[02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:15.780]  the government down but they would have blamed him but now russia vows revenge the us only understands
[02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:20.500]  force that's a kit daniel's article breaking it down kicking all these diplomats out calling
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:27.380]  him spies no proof saying these people got nerve gassed by russia over in the uk meanwhile china
[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:34.340]  flies bombers and fighters near taiwan threatens attacks against our ships that's roiders uh
[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:39.460]  meanwhile we've got the big news here being reported that even the fcc's talking about
[02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:46.580]  how the communist chinese have infiltrated the companies inside the united states the control
[02:34:46.580 --> 02:34:53.140]  through one central system all of our phones and all the phone number indexes that's just one example
[02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:58.500]  overhaul of us telecommunications database sparks fear of catastrophic failure that's how to free
[02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:06.420]  beacon but you've got to read all the way on page three how was chinese engineers infiltrating and
[02:35:06.420 --> 02:35:10.740]  getting the database now i'm not on some china bashing thing even though they're the biggest
[02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:16.340]  mass murders in history it's just that trump's not going after the vaccines now even though it
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:21.620]  hurt baron um trump is he's only turned a certain amount but if he stays on that course
[02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:26.980]  it's pretty soon he'll be back to hillary clinton and they're out to get him and it's his supporters
[02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:31.700]  fighting hard and under attack and the bullying and all of it he needs to fire up and get more
[02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:36.420]  aggressive he needs to be exposing election fraud in the states he needs to be out there
[02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:44.740]  meanwhile the democrats are full steam ahead and the more he rolls over to them the worse they get
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:50.980]  and so again i think trump looks at mainstream media too much i think the old republican leadership
[02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:57.540]  does they don't matter i go out there in the country and the young people the hispanic folks
[02:35:57.540 --> 02:36:01.860]  the black folks the white folks they don't know who these senators and congressmen are they know
[02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:08.580]  who i am they know who steven krauteres who's just exploding by the way paul watson mike cernovich
[02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:13.540]  they know who jack posseau because they know who my son is that's who's popular i'll be sitting there
[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:20.820]  again with famous people and who are national tv hosts no one knows who they are they know i am
[02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:26.980]  and i'm not bragging it's just trump 71 he's dialed into mainstream news and and and what
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:33.140]  mike cernovich said about he's obsessed with what alex baldman does uh on uh you know stupid programs
[02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:38.740]  like saturday night live instead of when his people rally by the thousands and get physically
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:43.620]  attacked that's the meat and potatoes that's the issues instead he thinks he'll virtue signal with
[02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:49.460]  melania and go good job kids protesting for safety as if he's going to neutralize it no
[02:36:49.460 --> 02:36:54.980]  they're calling for his head they're run by savage political operatives and get programmed and get a
[02:36:54.980 --> 02:37:00.740]  talking point sheet on record they're not gonna listen to you being nice to them so mike cernovich
[02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:04.580]  what in heydy's before you go to jeremy rick everybody else who i promise i'm gonna go to
[02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:10.900]  what do you think is really going on with trump well you nailed it it isn't that trump doesn't care
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:17.620]  is that he is still in that old media bubble and he doesn't actually know who matters and
[02:37:17.620 --> 02:37:25.460]  who's influential there's a reason that these groups are going after you and not fox news
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:33.140]  there's a reason that they want to destroy you it is again you and i talked about it i wrote
[02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:36.900]  this article it bothered people i was kind of took like what it's like being famous and people
[02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:40.740]  go oh you're fully yourself i'm like no actually i don't i want to be less famous i'm actually
[02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:47.940]  trying to keep a lower profile but we're more recognizable than almost anybody that you see on
[02:37:47.940 --> 02:37:53.460]  the so-called news people are talking about the stormy daniel's ratings well when i went on 60
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:59.220]  minutes 15 million people tuned in to watch the most since michelle and barack obama had done their
[02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:05.380]  special i was the biggest ratings draw 60 minutes it had other than barack obama inauguration and
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:13.540]  paylay lost his job after it he was well because they realized that and that's why they won't debate
[02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:20.580]  us they realized that the truth is on our side look at megan kelly she totally botched it she lost
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:27.380]  that show after the interview exactly and trump was obsessed with megan kelly for years even though
[02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:33.460]  he didn't realize she was a paper tiger these people are paper tigers who frame us and they lie
[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:38.580]  to us and if we don't let them lie about us and we actually say no actually what you're bringing
[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:43.780]  up is it true here's what's actually really true oh so you know you're actually going you said hillary
[02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:48.580]  fell down he goes yeah because she did and he goes but the campaign says she's fine you know the
[02:38:48.580 --> 02:38:52.820]  campaign's a bunch of liars and they thought that was a got you a moment but it blew up that shows
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:57.700]  how delusional they are so in a way just like mainstream media doesn't get it trump gets it
[02:38:57.700 --> 02:39:03.060]  because he's like a throwback to macarthianism and stuff in a good way but that's only his instincts
[02:39:03.060 --> 02:39:08.900]  when he doesn't follow him he's in the crap house he's just like mainstream media he's just like
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:16.740]  old people he still doesn't get it he doesn't understand new media at all he has great here's
[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:23.140]  a great example that i use which is why has trump given multiple exclusive interviews the new york
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:28.500]  times but he's never sat down with bill mitchell who you know you're a controversial guy i'm a
[02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:33.060]  controversial guy even though the media lies about it's like i understand but mitchell is very well
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:38.500]  spoken looks great right down the line the perfect kind of guy to be in the trump administration no
[02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:45.220]  right trump could just give the guy an interview and completely change bill mitchell's business
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:48.980]  overnight well mitchell would get 10 times bigger and that'd be nothing but good for trump
[02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:54.900]  exactly and trump doesn't care about bill mitchell bill mitchell's on there the you know trump cheerleader
[02:39:54.900 --> 02:39:58.820]  leads the trump cheerleading squad trump doesn't care trump doesn't say you know what bill you're
[02:39:58.820 --> 02:40:03.540]  a great guy i want to do an interview with you somebody who actually likes could you imagine
[02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:09.300]  bill mitchell is press secretary i mean he's he's good on every topic exactly so even if
[02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:13.620]  that's not an administration job there's no reason trump can't sit down with him that's
[02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:18.660]  that's new media sit down with bill mitchell give bill mitchell that one hour exclusive interview
[02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:23.380]  you know but they don't want to do that bandon went on 60 minutes i told bandon i said bandon you
[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:28.500]  need to try to go on the joe rogan podcast or dav rouven or something during the don jr stuff and
[02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:33.700]  i said you should go on alex joneson do new media bandon didn't get it either so they they they
[02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:38.900]  know they think like you get on the establishment you've arrived no the few times i get on these big
[02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:44.740]  things the audience doesn't even like it unless you totally overthrow the tables like i did on
[02:40:44.740 --> 02:40:51.460]  pierce morgan it's a joke if i go on one little christian station in alabama and plug my videos
[02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:57.060]  i would sell a thousand copies i'd go on seeing it and plug it and sell none that there's zombies
[02:40:57.060 --> 02:41:03.540]  watching its background noise it's elevator music people are not listening well yeah and
[02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:09.460]  actually nbc wanted to do a big interview with me and i told the guy who seemed like a nice guy said
[02:41:09.460 --> 02:41:15.540]  i go look me in no offense but i'm just bored with people coming in and trying to bring up
[02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:21.220]  irrelevant stuff because it doesn't move the needle for me being on nbc for me just doesn't
[02:41:21.220 --> 02:41:27.220]  move the needle at all 60 minutes i didn't sell any books alex 15 million people watched i sold
[02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:34.500]  zero books none at all so i'm thinking my god i went on hbo vice they spent 13 hours with me
[02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:41.380]  13 hours i didn't sell one book of guerrilla mindset from that video but when i come on your show
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:47.220]  and i talk about how guerrilla mindset has over a thousand reviews on amazon and i'll sell 100 just
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:52.420]  like that people go oh wow over a thousand reviews on amazon like almost no because we have an awake
[02:41:52.420 --> 02:41:57.220]  active audience it's a totally different world and that's why they hate enforcers not because of me
[02:41:57.220 --> 02:42:00.820]  it's because of all the guests and that we're awake and we have an audience is awake that's why
[02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:05.700]  i keep telling the audience you're the secret stop telling me how great i am they see info wars and
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:10.660]  other outlets like ours and yours as focal points of awake people and that's what they want to shut
[02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:15.460]  down is that we're able to come together and realize we're not alone well and they hate the liberals
[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:21.700]  too they hate dav rouban dav rouban's channel is constantly under attack they hate joe rogan because
[02:42:21.700 --> 02:42:27.620]  joe rogan is talking about seth rich and saying man this is really weird the problem is joe is so
[02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:32.500]  popular right now that's why i worry about him i think they might frame him for something joe is
[02:42:32.500 --> 02:42:38.020]  so popular that they can't go after him the way they've gone after the rubin report so dav rouban
[02:42:38.020 --> 02:42:43.140]  is a liberal jordan peterson is a liberal so even if you're a liberal if you're waking people up and
[02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:47.460]  getting people to think for themselves and not be zombies they're going to target you so it isn't
[02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:53.140]  even our it isn't even a war on conservatives per se it's a war on independence it's a war on
[02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:58.900]  independence we'll be back with calls the reason info wars life has five star ratings on major

[02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:22.500]  all right we got phones loaded with great people with great comments about the gun grabbing about
[02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:26.500]  trump on russia you name it mike cernovich is our guest mikey we're getting to a point
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:30.340]  where we hit break finish up with that and then i was getting into russia how the more he
[02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:34.820]  expands operations against russia the more they say oh look you're just backing off you know to get
[02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:39.700]  us off your back and then it's just made up i'm not in love with russia the communist china is so
[02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:45.300]  so in control of our country at so many levels i just wish americans realized how perilous
[02:48:45.300 --> 02:48:52.740]  the situation was so please continue yeah the trump is not a bad person the issue is
[02:48:52.740 --> 02:48:59.380]  he surrounded himself with really dumb advisors i don't know for example if you saw the gop ad
[02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:03.380]  i don't want to single it out too much because it's a good kid a high school kid but the gop
[02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:09.060]  goes oh this kid is going to use this tax cut to pay for college and the answer is like we know
[02:49:09.060 --> 02:49:14.340]  the college is too expensive to do that and two tax cuts aren't how you get the youth vote
[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:19.620]  but if you're the gop that's what they think oh tax cuts they don't realize no college kids can't
[02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:25.780]  write trump and chalk on the sidewalk without facing death threats that's what matters to the
[02:49:25.780 --> 02:49:30.100]  issue is the free speech the issue is the authoritarian left the issue is that they're
[02:49:30.100 --> 02:49:35.140]  out of control but the old elites are so used to living in freedom they have no idea we've got a
[02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:42.180]  giant bolshevik's infection exactly our leg is rotting off with green pus coming out and the
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:47.540]  republican establishment's playing golf yeah you wear trump had on college campus they'll kick
[02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:51.540]  you out of class there was a student kicked out of class for claiming that there were only two
[02:49:51.540 --> 02:49:56.820]  genders even though that was the topic of the discussion for debate there's nothing from this
[02:49:56.820 --> 02:50:01.860]  from the republicans there's nothing from this from trump so the issue is that trump has buffoons
[02:50:01.860 --> 02:50:07.620]  all around him g.o.p stooge is his his number one advisor is now a guy by the name of johnny
[02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:14.340]  de stefano whose previous job was driving john boiner to spray tans that's who he has that's
[02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:20.180]  kind of the running inside joke is how johnny de stefano whose last job is taking john boiner
[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:25.940]  to a spray tan appointment how does that become trump's chief advisor well it really does say
[02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:32.340]  it all so these people are telling trump and this is why this is why i threw a big fit about the
[02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:36.420]  omnibus bill people go sternovich you're fair weather you're this i go first of all i'm not fair
[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:40.100]  whether anything i don't work for the g.o.p i don't work for trump i work for the people
[02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:44.820]  and my job is that when you turn into a mike sternovich transmission you don't know what
[02:50:44.820 --> 02:50:48.900]  you're going to get because you know that i always bring the fire so what i told people though is
[02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:55.060]  if you supported trump signing the omnibus bill johnny de stefano and all these other advisors
[02:50:55.060 --> 02:51:01.060]  are going to say see see don you know we told you that this was no big deal your base wouldn't care
[02:51:01.060 --> 02:51:04.580]  and then trump will say oh yeah you guys are real smart you guys are real right and then they get
[02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:08.980]  more no understanding we don't stay on trump he will get influenced by the people around him
[02:51:09.780 --> 02:51:16.020]  exactly so when we push back and then that gets on fox news trump goes well wait a minute you guys
[02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:21.460]  told me this was a good idea you guys told me the the people weren't going to care and they do care
[02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:27.620]  so that's why we have to raise holy heck whenever trump does something like the omnibus bill but
[02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:31.940]  likewise we don't want to be negative and when he does great things and he's done many amazing things
[02:51:31.940 --> 02:51:37.220]  you're all the stuff he was planning for 20 years uh china the economy all this he's doing
[02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:41.620]  because that's what he believes in but the problem is he only watches basically fox news
[02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:47.220]  seeing an ms mbc as you said the new york times they try to keep info wars your material away from him
[02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:51.780]  and and and and so that's why this is happening we've come so far i want to go to some phone
[02:51:51.780 --> 02:51:58.260]  calls here but what about the russia situation i mean that is really dangerous because there's no
[02:51:58.260 --> 02:52:04.340]  evidence russian nerve gas these people and now we're just barreling towards war yeah well they've
[02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:10.420]  always wanted world war three and it looks like we're now going to have a proxy war in syria
[02:52:10.980 --> 02:52:16.740]  and it'll be the us saudi arabia and israel i don't know if you saw this but there are things
[02:52:16.740 --> 02:52:21.620]  that you can watch that if you're woke you know what is happening so there was a bunch of news
[02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:28.980]  footage of saudi anti um airstrike missiles shooting so-called iranian missiles and then
[02:52:28.980 --> 02:52:35.700]  that went viral and you're like well wait a minute why is that clip going viral so we'll talk about
[02:52:35.700 --> 02:52:39.700]  the trump russian diplomats but something important yesterday happened that all woke people notice
[02:52:40.340 --> 02:52:45.140]  is whenever you're starting to see a new messaging you're like oh wait a minute they got their
[02:52:45.140 --> 02:52:50.020]  talking points now from the deep state oh that's how i mean they still attack us with stuff that
[02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:55.940]  podesta wrote two years ago you know gay frogs nobody died in new town all exactly so you see the
[02:52:55.940 --> 02:53:00.340]  new talking points coming out that saudi arabia is going to help in syria saudi arabia's got
[02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:04.740]  weapons to fight iran if iran attacks them it's the idea that iran's getting ready to attack
[02:53:05.540 --> 02:53:10.420]  it exactly so so you're now seeing these great viral videos and i retweeted one of the videos
[02:53:10.420 --> 02:53:16.580]  yesterday they go um the hoothy rebels and yemen backed by iran so you're like wait a minute now
[02:53:16.580 --> 02:53:22.820]  that they're doing this brilliant propaganda because they're going to propagandize us into war
[02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:29.060]  so war is coming the movie is the movie is turning dark and it's going to be there there is even an
[02:53:29.060 --> 02:53:34.500]  article is um saudi arabia opened up planes to israeli air airspace for the first time so now
[02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:38.580]  the saudi's into the israeli's in the united states and they're saying that the saudi's are
[02:53:38.580 --> 02:53:43.620]  secretly meeting with israel every day in cairo exactly and so they don't have to put pressure
[02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:47.940]  on trump a lot of wild stuff behind the scenes getting more confused telling me there's wars
[02:53:47.940 --> 02:53:53.380]  coming he's got to defend america get it all rolling and they go sir this will get us out of the russia
[02:53:53.380 --> 02:53:58.980]  thing even though it's not true be hard line with russia which is in syria and then get with saudi
[02:53:58.980 --> 02:54:04.820]  arabia and exactly and the whole thing unfolds yes so we're headed towards world war three i've
[02:54:04.820 --> 02:54:13.380]  told people that you're crazy if you're not stacking up survival food survival water nacy and iodine

[02:54:18.580 --> 02:54:24.580]  and i go i take like 50 different supplements and i do take the iodine because we have to realize
[02:54:24.580 --> 02:54:30.980]  that it's it's coming and i'm not a doomsday person when people watch me that if anything they're
[02:54:30.980 --> 02:54:34.980]  like why aren't you freaking out more this is a bigger deal and you make it out to be but people
[02:54:34.980 --> 02:54:39.540]  have to have canned foods or survival foods or it's about to say even mainstream news admits that
[02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:44.900]  the billionaires are fleeing to new zealand they built the bases years ago now they're leaving
[02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:50.660]  that's in the news the jets are leaving they're saying we're gone what are they thinking all this

[02:54:56.500 --> 02:55:01.780]  travel and all of a sudden this newfound interest what's going on so when you when you watch the
[02:55:01.780 --> 02:55:07.220]  when you watch the news you're like wait a minute the news is now telling us that we should like
[02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:13.060]  Saudi Arabia even though they sponsored 9 11 we just did a how big of a bit arms deal now with
[02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:17.940]  the Saudis i think one billion the Saudis are going to get nuclear nuclear technology oh the

[03:00:51.460 --> 03:00:59.060]  go ahead hey alex thanks for taking my call thank you sir um alex when i actually mike sarnovich
[03:00:59.060 --> 03:01:05.220]  was just saying about you know and yourself about you know i love trump and i love the positive
[03:01:05.220 --> 03:01:09.940]  things that he's done but i'll say and one of the things i kind of disagree with him one and he did
[03:01:09.940 --> 03:01:15.540]  say was in order for him to stop this right now he needs to go in the offense and he needs to
[03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:20.660]  you know pursue national reciprocity and getting that pass because i know right now it's come to
[03:01:20.660 --> 03:01:27.220]  sitting in in the house of congress if he would pass this and help this get through it would really
[03:01:27.220 --> 03:01:31.780]  shut up the left and i agree well if you look at trump on the economic front he's doing a great job
[03:01:32.340 --> 03:01:37.540]  he's obsessed with that with turning the economy on because that's the base deal but the constituents
[03:01:37.540 --> 03:01:42.260]  want ideology i think is what mike sarnovich is saying and they want to see him interact
[03:01:42.260 --> 03:01:47.460]  and interface with his cohorts that are going through physical hell on the street they want to
[03:01:47.460 --> 03:01:51.940]  hear him recognize what we've gone through and then we'll be 10 times stronger is that what you're
[03:01:51.940 --> 03:01:59.780]  saying mike please so as you know when you're attacked you don't say no no no i'm a good guy
[03:01:59.780 --> 03:02:04.740]  please please please leave me alone that's how you get storm rolls so here's the way to win
[03:02:04.740 --> 03:02:13.620]  let's title this segment how trump can win in 2018 go on the offense demand that congress do an
[03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:20.980]  up or down vote on reciprocity for a concealed carry that'll make the gun vote come out big time
[03:02:20.980 --> 03:02:26.340]  exactly he's just got a direct stuff and if it doesn't happen it's okay at least he's trying
[03:02:26.340 --> 03:02:30.740]  because when he gives an order that's right we all get mobilized exactly mike so what
[03:02:30.740 --> 03:02:37.220]  else does he do he calls for reciprocity up or down vote he presses you know for repealing any other
[03:02:37.220 --> 03:02:41.620]  how about silencer bands silencers aren't using crimes what else does he do to get people mobilized
[03:02:42.420 --> 03:02:49.940]  he goes after facebook which as we now know has censored you censored me and their criminals their
[03:02:49.940 --> 03:02:54.980]  data processing i don't know if you read the reports but they are if you have an android
[03:02:54.980 --> 03:03:00.260]  phone with facebook on it they monitor every text message and every call that you've ever made
[03:03:00.260 --> 03:03:04.820]  and every contact to a level that if you were a computer hacker you would go to prison for your
[03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:11.540]  life so trump needs to demand national reciprocity he needs to criminal investigation of didn't they
[03:03:11.540 --> 03:03:16.180]  jump the shark going after this analytical thing to me that's nothing compared to the exactly what
[03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:21.220]  facebook does the left was so dumb to open up the can of words when that the can of worms they run
[03:03:21.220 --> 03:03:26.740]  facebook now they've opened up the fact that's a giant criminal data mining operation exactly a
[03:03:26.740 --> 03:03:33.460]  criminal rico investigation into facebook would be two three would be demand that all state
[03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:39.620]  universities which do not support and respect free speech will be denied federal education funding
[03:03:40.500 --> 03:03:46.340]  well you're laying it out absolutely up or down reciprocal concealed carry vote uh criminal
[03:03:46.340 --> 03:03:52.420]  investigation racketeering uh not just antitrust of facebook who is the main uh problem and then
[03:03:52.420 --> 03:03:56.820]  the big one these universities that say no free speech and spot all this kill the cops
[03:03:56.820 --> 03:04:01.300]  white people the devil stuff your your federal funding is stripped that would neuter their ass
[03:04:01.300 --> 03:04:06.020]  fast what else yeah well i'm getting fired up just thinking about that see and that's what
[03:04:06.020 --> 03:04:12.900]  trump has to realize announce those big pillars right now the yeah we want to hear about an
[03:04:12.900 --> 03:04:19.860]  offense exactly yeah yeah we're tired i'm tired of stormy daniels trump alex balk crying about
[03:04:19.860 --> 03:04:25.940]  a criminal investigation of george soros for money laundering and for it meant uh uh uh
[03:04:25.940 --> 03:04:31.620]  fooling around with the elections or a department of justice investigation in the southern poverty

[03:06:20.580 --> 03:06:23.940]  coming up another segment uh the great jaryl salento will be here but
[03:06:25.620 --> 03:06:30.820]  people think that i want to be establishment and i'll never forget carl roe during the rnc
[03:06:30.820 --> 03:06:36.180]  we landed in cleveland there's video this online and i'm trying to talk to him he goes you don't
[03:06:36.180 --> 03:06:41.140]  get it you don't play by the rules you'll never be on fox and i was offered three different fox
[03:06:41.140 --> 03:06:46.580]  news shows and i was like wait they don't pay anything till i'm on for like six months
[03:06:46.580 --> 03:06:51.540]  and then i make a half million dollars a year i mean i was 27 years old bringing in three million
[03:06:51.540 --> 03:06:56.420]  dollars a year we bring in 50 plus million dollars a year now but i put it into infrastructure
[03:06:56.420 --> 03:07:01.380]  satellites and the crew i don't even want more money i want a smaller house i'm happy with my
[03:07:01.380 --> 03:07:07.460]  dodge car and my four truck i'm not trying to get a bigger house at the country club i'm not i'm
[03:07:07.460 --> 03:07:12.980]  trying to change the world so to have them laugh at me and go you're not on fox news and have fox
[03:07:12.980 --> 03:07:18.100]  news executives i'll never forget newark daily news go jones tried to get fox shows but he failed
[03:07:18.100 --> 03:07:23.620]  because they want everybody to think we're trying to sell out to be with them when that's the furthest
[03:07:23.620 --> 03:07:31.620]  place you know that i want to be so again but trump is a good patriot a good nationalist but he still
[03:07:31.620 --> 03:07:37.380]  doesn't get that it fox news and the new york times don't matter is that what you're getting at mike
[03:07:37.380 --> 03:07:42.820]  sernovich it's the grassroots it's the future it's populism and the good news is eastern europe
[03:07:42.820 --> 03:07:48.820]  latin america they all get it they're all anti-establishment hollywood's never been more uncool
[03:07:48.820 --> 03:07:55.300]  i mean that doesn't trump get that he does not get it and it's funny you bring up fox news because
[03:07:55.300 --> 03:08:01.780]  i held a massive event in new york called the night for freedom and a couple reporters who wrote
[03:08:01.780 --> 03:08:08.100]  about it go oh sernovich showed that he's not ready for fox news because he called out hollywood
[03:08:08.100 --> 03:08:16.420]  pedophilia and i said how many people on fox news could sell out an event in new york and hold it
[03:08:16.420 --> 03:08:23.380]  none maybe hanity you know maybe talk or a couple people so they go oh you know how dare um sernovich
[03:08:23.380 --> 03:08:28.580]  call out hollywood pedophilia he'll never be on fox and i go i'm bigger than the people on fox
[03:08:28.580 --> 03:08:37.460]  i'm recognized in public i'm walking down san diego with my wife whose persian and a latino man
[03:08:37.460 --> 03:08:42.660]  and his latino girlfriend go hey we want you and alex all the time we love you guys tell alex i said
[03:08:42.660 --> 03:08:48.740]  hi take a picture i want to post it on instagram we are we are uniting we are uniting the racism
[03:08:48.740 --> 03:08:54.100]  that's why they hate us by the way that's why the lefty clementine own hispanics because per capita
[03:08:54.100 --> 03:09:00.100]  hispanic americans are the most awake most resonant group with these shows i found that's who they
[03:09:00.100 --> 03:09:07.620]  really fear well and that's why they keep bringing up spirit cooking because hispanic voters are very
[03:09:07.620 --> 03:09:12.900]  catholic and actually one of my readers said when his mother read that story which made all the
[03:09:12.900 --> 03:09:19.380]  latino newspapers she did the sign of the cross so that's why they so people go oh why why does
[03:09:19.380 --> 03:09:23.620]  clinton keep bringing up spirit cooking that was two years ago even though there was that killed him
[03:09:23.620 --> 03:09:27.940]  with catholic and hispanic voters yeah because they know a woman with a goat head and alistair
[03:09:27.940 --> 03:09:32.420]  crowley and people in vats of blood they know that's devil worship the media critic oh that's not
[03:09:32.420 --> 03:09:39.060]  devil worship the hell of it and yeah exactly so that that could have tipped the latino vote
[03:09:39.060 --> 03:09:43.220]  and in ways that they weren't anticipate i can tell you podesta and then believe that's what killed
[03:09:43.220 --> 03:09:49.780]  hillary was drudge linking to paul watson spirit cooking article and they they keep that's the thing
[03:09:49.780 --> 03:09:55.620]  they keep bringing it up because to me like they i'm like why do you bring that up i forgot about it
[03:09:55.620 --> 03:10:00.500]  what do you you know what are you yeah so if you're a catholic latino and you see a woman holding
[03:10:00.500 --> 03:10:06.260]  the head of boffamette with blood going down on it you know what that means if you're catholic you
[03:10:06.260 --> 03:10:11.860]  know you know what they're doing there you know what that symbolism is and well take one look at
[03:10:11.860 --> 03:10:16.660]  that woman and then and then all the alistair crowley crap and little kids in vats of blood good god
[03:10:17.620 --> 03:10:21.620]  yeah and that's why they keep bringing it up otherwise to me i i tell these people wow you
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:27.220]  have to go back two years to find things about me that you don't like i can go back yesterday and
[03:10:27.220 --> 03:10:32.980]  find the fake news media docs for jewish women and their mom is um a man was literally let me ask you
[03:10:32.980 --> 03:10:37.540]  to make a few calls my gut is we're gonna win if we stay awake and get involved but this is the
[03:10:37.540 --> 03:10:41.300]  biggest salt i think they're playing at something really really big and the fact that trumps rolled
[03:10:41.300 --> 03:10:46.020]  over to the false flags and patronized the gun grabber groups and tried to neutralize them that
[03:10:46.020 --> 03:10:51.620]  was the wrong advice he encouraged it instead of and i think he sowed the seeds of big problems
[03:10:52.420 --> 03:11:00.180]  yeah it's over a trump will be impeached beginning in november 2018 if he does not take immediate
[03:11:00.180 --> 03:11:04.900]  offense i agree i think he's got a month or two to turn it around and wake up or he just screwed
[03:11:04.900 --> 03:11:12.340]  himself no question you know i put an emergency warning out to him and he called me two days
[03:11:12.340 --> 03:11:15.860]  after about it the media kind of picked up as he instantly responded i said if you don't attack
[03:11:15.860 --> 03:11:20.180]  during the next debate you're done he's kindly got that the thing is they got the clip to him
[03:11:20.180 --> 03:11:24.180]  and it's not that he's highly influenceable he goes with his gut when somebody else
[03:11:24.180 --> 03:11:28.580]  seconds what he already thinks the problem is if nobody seconds what he thinks then he'll go with
[03:11:28.580 --> 03:11:33.540]  them and that's the problem and i don't and i can't it's very hard to get my i mean we got into
[03:11:33.540 --> 03:11:40.820]  stuff about mcmaster and the and the uh the soros operative and so that happened took him six months
[03:11:40.820 --> 03:11:44.900]  and i just can't get stuff through to him mic what do we do i mean i i know they've cut your sources
[03:11:44.900 --> 03:11:52.100]  off to him well there's a reason that the fake news media smeared what multiple of his workers
[03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:58.900]  and lied about them they johnny daystaffano is now trump's right-hand man and johnny daystaffano
[03:11:58.900 --> 03:12:05.540]  is as establishment as it gets as basic republican loser as it gets and they're telling him oh yeah
[03:12:05.540 --> 03:12:10.340]  your base loves you they love the tax cut they actually my taxes went up because of where i live
[03:12:10.340 --> 03:12:16.180]  so the tax cut um ended up hurting me and a lot of your upper middle class mine went up too but it
[03:12:16.180 --> 03:12:20.340]  is good for the overall blue collar another economy but yeah now trump did a kind of jfk
[03:12:20.340 --> 03:12:27.300]  tax deal it was very classic democrat well the answer is that i'm the point is this out i supported
[03:12:27.300 --> 03:12:33.540]  the tax cut even though my own taxes went up because i want money going to hard work no no i
[03:12:33.540 --> 03:12:41.300]  do too no i told people my taxes went up that said tax cuts don't get the vote out people don't
[03:12:41.300 --> 03:12:50.500]  know ideology does yeah vision does gun rights do free speech does showing that you're a leader
[03:12:50.500 --> 03:12:55.780]  that you're playing this ought to be his new slogan trump fights for america not this or that

[03:27:24.100 --> 03:27:32.020]  issue is that violence has become the norm and is very well accepted and again hollywood sells it
[03:27:32.020 --> 03:27:38.660]  and military industrial complex makes money off you look at that new budget that was passed
[03:27:39.620 --> 03:27:45.060]  half the dose going to the military industrial complex oh you want to stop gun violence when

[03:33:34.020 --> 03:33:40.340]  doing everything they can to stop it you know one of the big issues going on of course is today the
[03:33:40.340 --> 03:33:49.060]  united states joined in with the european allies and others in expelling russians because they
[03:33:49.060 --> 03:33:58.420]  allegedly poisoned the spy over there in the uk several days ago i remember a spy right like it's
[03:33:58.420 --> 03:34:05.940]  not mary poppins you know it's Cinderella they did you know it was a mother teresa if they did it
[03:34:05.940 --> 03:34:14.180]  it was a spy you know wow big deal right the russians claim they didn't do it and just like
[03:34:14.180 --> 03:34:21.140]  like they have provided not one shred of evidence not one piece of hard evidence that
[03:34:23.780 --> 03:34:33.220]  the russians hacked the dnc in 2016 so that all the dirt about hillary clinton or some of it
[03:34:33.940 --> 03:34:41.620]  came flowing out not one piece of evidence we believe we suggest you know we could you can't
[03:34:41.620 --> 03:34:47.540]  go to can't go to court with we believe and we suggest how about showing me some evidence
[03:34:47.540 --> 03:34:54.980]  junior it's like colon and you know what goes down the colon don't your power held up that little
[03:34:54.980 --> 03:35:00.660]  vial of colon crap and says saddam who's saying had weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-qaeda
[03:35:00.660 --> 03:35:11.300]  when they didn't have any so going back to now this screemble poisoning in russia and the united
[03:35:11.300 --> 03:35:21.780]  states joining in with others to throw out russian diplomats and other russians this is what they
[03:35:21.780 --> 03:35:30.900]  said these are the quotes about their proof that the russians did it this is teresa may the british
[03:35:30.900 --> 03:35:40.420]  prime minister whose popularity rating is in the toilet where it belongs and having difficulties
[03:35:40.420 --> 03:35:45.460]  with brexit to get their people's minds off the problems she's the one that started this
[03:35:46.580 --> 03:35:55.860]  it's highly likely that russia is responsible highly likely is that a fact no it's highly likely and
[03:35:57.380 --> 03:36:04.260]  what else came out washington responded it's likely responsible the russians
[03:36:04.260 --> 03:36:11.700]  donald trump said it looks like and what else do we have here
[03:36:12.820 --> 03:36:21.620]  yeah the german chancellor highly likely and macron the katzone from uh france
[03:36:22.980 --> 03:36:30.180]  there is no other plausible explanation no only one explanation no other plausible ones
[03:36:30.180 --> 03:36:41.380]  how could anybody take this baloney and that's what's going on so it's very important to stay
[03:36:41.380 --> 03:36:48.420]  with the facts and one of the facts are that you know one of the things i keep saying is that if
[03:36:48.420 --> 03:36:55.460]  you pump trillions of gallons of poison into the earth into the water and into the air it's not
[03:36:55.460 --> 03:37:00.500]  going to be so good particularly when you're living in an environment with so many chemical
[03:37:00.500 --> 03:37:06.660]  composites whether it's in the rugs or the wood or whatever else you got around your place so
[03:37:06.660 --> 03:37:15.540]  that's why it's really important for you to consider alexa pure breeze air purifier and
[03:37:15.540 --> 03:37:21.380]  that's right and just like with the many of the other products on info war when you buy it now
[03:37:21.380 --> 03:37:29.380]  you get money off and with that one fifty dollars off with free shipping but it's for a limited time
[03:37:29.380 --> 03:37:37.300]  only at info wars stores dot com and the air in your home like the air that they keep putting
[03:37:37.300 --> 03:37:47.460]  out by the prostitutes in the media it's filled with dust bacteria allergens and viruses so you
[03:37:47.460 --> 03:37:56.340]  gotta clean that air and your alexa pure breeze air purifier that you could get for fifty dollars off
[03:37:56.980 --> 03:38:06.900]  with free shipping for a limited time only at info wars dot com is the way to go so again it's
[03:38:06.900 --> 03:38:13.940]  about cleansing the air and cleansing your mind from the garbage that they keep pumping into it
[03:38:13.940 --> 03:38:21.700]  which was why i very much enjoy being on info wars with alex jones and david night
[03:38:21.700 --> 03:38:28.500]  with the real news and again you know all the products tie right into it they're all connected
[03:38:29.780 --> 03:38:35.620]  keeping you healthy and keeping you clean at a time when they just keep pumping dirt down our
[03:38:35.620 --> 03:38:45.860]  brain and again staying with us comments about russians and by the way the russians have been
[03:38:45.860 --> 03:38:54.020]  asking for proof and they refuse to give it to them and again what little clown in life would
[03:38:54.020 --> 03:39:00.980]  take garbage from a little jerk like macron that got sewn from france by saying there is no other
[03:39:00.980 --> 03:39:09.700]  plausible explanation oh wait you just only your explanation is the plausible one junior oh no not
[03:39:09.700 --> 03:39:17.380]  junior you're a little rough child sellout gangster boy a pair of nothing that would be nowhere
[03:39:17.380 --> 03:39:26.580]  without the dough pushing you where you are junior and then that other little clown another little
[03:39:26.580 --> 03:39:42.500]  you know what the nato secretary general secretary jerk jens stoltenberg said this was consistent
[03:39:42.500 --> 03:39:49.380]  with a general quote reckless pattern of russian behavior over many years
[03:39:49.380 --> 03:40:01.140]  and then they got this other guy borris johnson you want to see a living clown a live freak boy
[03:40:01.140 --> 03:40:07.620]  i'll tell you man a lot of you folks out there were too young to remember the greatest show on
[03:40:07.620 --> 03:40:14.100]  earth the ringling brothers barnum and bailey circus this is a guy you would have spent a lot
[03:40:14.100 --> 03:40:21.780]  of dough to see a living freak like you've never seen before step right up step right up it's borris
[03:40:21.780 --> 03:40:28.980]  johnson a clown in real life and a clown in fake one too this is what this little jerk said
[03:40:31.300 --> 03:40:40.180]  again this is without a shred of evidence he said that our quarrel is with putans kremlin
[03:40:40.180 --> 03:40:49.140]  and with his decision and we think it's overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision
[03:40:50.260 --> 03:41:00.100]  to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the uk we think you can't think of anything

[03:46:03.860 --> 03:46:10.020]  and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their

[03:46:16.740 --> 03:46:23.620]  racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates

[03:47:24.020 --> 03:47:29.540]  hey welcome back welcome back welcome back wonderful being here on info wars
[03:47:30.660 --> 03:47:37.540]  and uh again at a time when it's very hard to find not it's not fake news they're putting out
[03:47:37.540 --> 03:47:44.580]  so much as dumb news i mean yeah hey did you hear about stormy daniels come on stop her f i
[03:47:44.580 --> 03:47:51.220]  don't want to hear any more yeah i was on with uh david night this morning on real news and he
[03:47:51.220 --> 03:47:57.940]  made a comment and boy i love being on with david the guy really knows his uh financial data as well
[03:47:57.940 --> 03:48:03.700]  as a lot of other great information and he said to me you know we're talking about the trade war
[03:48:03.700 --> 03:48:11.380]  going on the last the media calls it and he said you know china started this and i said yeah you're
[03:48:11.380 --> 03:48:17.380]  right and he said look at the deficit we have three hundred and seventy five billion dollar deficit
[03:48:17.380 --> 03:48:24.100]  who do business with anybody and keep losing money and everybody's outraged that trump wants to
[03:48:24.100 --> 03:48:28.980]  stop that and again i make it very clear when it comes to geopolitical things i'm not on the same
[03:48:28.980 --> 03:48:34.500]  page of trump on most of them or many of them but when it comes to this i'm totally on the same
[03:48:34.500 --> 03:48:40.820]  page as him the facts are there we lost a job since bill clinton sold us out with nafta and the rest
[03:48:40.820 --> 03:48:46.900]  of the democrats and republicans and we saw he sold us out with the world trade organization
[03:48:46.900 --> 03:48:52.820]  that china joined by the way two weeks after 9 11 when no one was watching the middle class went
[03:48:52.820 --> 03:48:59.780]  for five percent back in 2001 to almost 35 percent today and we all know that everything we pick up
[03:48:59.780 --> 03:49:05.700]  now it's made in china made in china made in china and what's really who's fighting trump on this
[03:49:05.700 --> 03:49:10.500]  are a lot of the people that are getting their products made up there the retail sector
[03:49:12.260 --> 03:49:16.020]  you know it's made in china and they're bringing it back marking it up and making dough on it so
[03:49:16.020 --> 03:49:24.820]  they're fighting that so in picking up what david said here's a story wall street journal admits
[03:49:24.820 --> 03:49:33.620]  china started the trade war and this is by wall street journals greg ip china started it long before
[03:49:34.180 --> 03:49:38.100]  trump became president and how many more facts do you need
[03:49:38.100 --> 03:49:48.900]  it we lost over 3 million jobs those are facts just with china lying slick willy i didn't have sex
[03:49:48.900 --> 03:49:55.220]  with that woman monica lewinsky i smoked but i didn't hail clinton promised us 200 000 manufacturing
[03:49:55.220 --> 03:50:07.780]  jobs with nafta we lost nearly a million we went from a positive trade balance to now we're
[03:50:07.780 --> 03:50:15.380]  down what 71 billion with nafta with mexico it's one loss after another 17 billion down in canada
[03:50:16.980 --> 03:50:25.700]  so it's not a trade war one of my top trends back in 2016 was self-sustaining economies
[03:50:27.220 --> 03:50:35.300]  they're throwing out this baloney that if you know prices will go up well so what if my wages
[03:50:35.300 --> 03:50:43.620]  go up which they're not going up now for most americans and i'm making a lot more i'll pay more
[03:50:43.620 --> 03:50:50.180]  just like when you have a lot of dough and you buy luxury products so we became a dollar store
[03:50:50.180 --> 03:50:58.180]  society isn't that wonderful because they pay us dollar store wages because slimy slick willy
[03:50:58.180 --> 03:51:05.620]  an arrogant warm mongering freak wonder why hillary clinton lost can't understand why probably
[03:51:05.620 --> 03:51:12.420]  because she's as disgusting as it is oh hey women that's why oh yeah that's why 52 percent of the
[03:51:12.420 --> 03:51:20.900]  women voted for trump anyway bill clinton sold us out he sold at our high paying jobs you know
[03:51:20.900 --> 03:51:28.900]  i get your hands dirty in the manufacturing jobs you can get a job in a retail sector yeah waiting
[03:51:28.900 --> 03:51:38.260]  on tables become a bartender how about a ambulatory care or i got a better one hospitality sector
[03:51:39.060 --> 03:51:43.540]  so we could pay you nothing and work in target walmart and all the other ones that have taken
[03:51:43.540 --> 03:51:54.580]  over the country so yes i'd love to pay more if i'm making more and a self-sustaining economy means
[03:51:54.580 --> 03:52:00.420]  we have what 320 million people we're rich in just virtually every resource we need
[03:52:03.060 --> 03:52:08.500]  great country by both demographically psychographically and naturally
[03:52:08.500 --> 03:52:13.540]  why do i have to buy chinese i want to buy american
[03:52:15.460 --> 03:52:25.220]  huh when i want some nice prosciutto a cup of cola a parmesan i want to tell you like i want
[03:52:25.220 --> 03:52:33.860]  a nice french red wine is a nice cognac but i want to buy my american shoes and my american pants
[03:52:33.860 --> 03:52:43.940]  and drive the american car that's the best one there i want to be bring production back here
[03:52:44.740 --> 03:52:52.260]  because when i was a young guy people working in what are now rust belt states had very nice middle
[03:52:52.260 --> 03:53:06.980]  class lives they were making more and living better now we're earning less and buying less
[03:53:08.340 --> 03:53:14.260]  and you know the data american consumer has over 13 trillion dollars in debt
[03:53:14.260 --> 03:53:26.180]  so going back to the trade as we speak boom boom the dow is up and shop over 600 points
[03:53:27.300 --> 03:53:35.140]  and mentioned to david night this morning dow going down had nothing to do with the so-called
[03:53:35.140 --> 03:53:43.940]  trade war just as those little headline news jerks in the business media said oh the last
[03:53:43.940 --> 03:53:51.460]  reason was they fired that guy gary cohen he left gary who gary what gary who cares
[03:53:53.140 --> 03:54:03.700]  that wasn't it at all the markets went down last thursday excuse me last wednesday following
[03:54:04.580 --> 03:54:13.300]  Jerome Powell the new fed shares statement that interest rates were going up this is from the
[03:54:13.300 --> 03:54:19.860]  financial times thursday remember he comes out wednesday the markets were up 250 points
[03:54:20.580 --> 03:54:27.700]  after they absorbed what the fed chair said the market closed down almost 50 that's like a 300
[03:54:27.700 --> 03:54:36.180]  point full change so here's what they said Powell's Powell lifts fed rates
[03:54:36.180 --> 03:54:43.860]  the federal reserve lifted short-term interest rates by a quarter point and forecast rates
[03:54:43.860 --> 03:54:53.620]  would rise faster than expected in the coming years that's what drove down the markets don't
[03:54:53.620 --> 03:55:01.380]  believe me how about this one the wall street journal again thursday after the wednesday
[03:55:01.380 --> 03:55:10.260]  the stocks fall if the fed raises rates from his eternity paper a record the new york times
[03:55:12.980 --> 03:55:20.020]  market cheaters and falls as fed raises rates that's why the markets went down
[03:55:20.020 --> 03:55:30.180]  down not the baloney about gary cohen not the baloney about raising tariffs
[03:55:31.460 --> 03:55:35.700]  what are they talking about 60 billion dollars let's jump change
[03:55:38.020 --> 03:55:42.500]  375 billion dollar trade deficit just with china
[03:55:42.500 --> 03:55:54.740]  it's interest rates that's what's concerning the markets the markets went up on cheap interest
[03:55:54.740 --> 03:56:01.380]  rates unprecedented in the history of the world part one and part two nobody ever heard a negative
[03:56:01.380 --> 03:56:10.180]  and zero interest rate policy or quantitative easing now we say the trump rally and where
[03:56:10.180 --> 03:56:15.940]  were the first magazine to call it a week after he got elected it's in our trends journal
[03:56:17.780 --> 03:56:27.060]  we were the first one to say back in december it'd be a 10 correction in 2018 and there was
[03:56:28.500 --> 03:56:30.660]  and now we're saying the trump rally is p
[03:56:33.220 --> 03:56:39.780]  it won't crash because of the trump tax policies that are allowing companies to repatriate money
[03:56:39.780 --> 03:56:45.220]  overseas and by lowering the taxes they're reinvesting in stocks
[03:56:48.260 --> 03:56:53.140]  that's going to keep the market up because already stock buybacks this time of the year
[03:56:53.140 --> 03:56:59.220]  are at record high and so too emerges in acquisition so it all depends on interest rates
[03:56:59.780 --> 03:57:05.940]  if interest rates go up too fast the market goes down hard and once you watch and i keep
[03:57:05.940 --> 03:57:12.660]  saying to people watch the price of gold as goes gold the opposite direction will be the markets
[03:57:13.940 --> 03:57:20.980]  so thank you very much see you soon and until the next time stay tuned to info wars
