[00:00.000 --> 00:16.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show I gotta
[00:16.480 --> 00:22.840]  tell you haven't Megan Kelly here yesterday until like 1045 at night was a
[00:22.840 --> 00:30.480]  soul-sucking experience I tell you I take my licks to get the word out but
[00:30.480 --> 00:41.480]  man dealing with lawyers that make being sociopaths an art form really lets you
[00:41.480 --> 00:45.800]  know why society's in so much trouble later in the broadcast I think I'm gonna
[00:45.800 --> 00:50.600]  talk a little bit about her visit and this report supposedly gonna air in the
[00:50.600 --> 00:58.880]  next few weeks this profile that's really a investigative report masquerading
[00:58.880 --> 01:05.000]  as a profile but really fake news in my view I will be airing you know nice
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.640]  people nice producer I felt like the lady that's the lead producer nice Southern
[01:09.640 --> 01:16.760]  Bell lady older lady is like somebody that leads you to the gas chamber or to
[01:16.760 --> 01:23.360]  the hangman's noose or to the electric chair the comfort you give you your last
[01:23.360 --> 01:29.320]  meal but they tell you that heaven is on the other side of the electrical volts
[01:29.320 --> 01:37.480]  it'll be pouring through your brain but I know that I know MSM is discredited I
[01:37.480 --> 01:44.960]  know it's rigged so occasionally I go into the lion's den so that we can just
[01:44.960 --> 01:47.960]  illustrate exactly what we're looking at and the arrogance of the power structure
[01:47.960 --> 01:51.440]  that put out the fake polls for Hillary that try to steal the election that's
[01:51.440 --> 01:55.280]  done all these other things that thought that we would accept having al-qaeda and
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.360]  ISIS brought into our country the arrogance of MSM will be its undoing
[01:59.360 --> 02:05.400]  and imagine they were here from 9 30 in the morning until 10 45 at night it's
[02:05.400 --> 02:13.920]  when we stop doing interviews I said sure so they can edit it down to 11
[02:13.920 --> 02:21.000]  minutes and make me look as bad as possible but think about how far we've
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.800]  come together that they've got to do stuff like this and attack us on every
[02:24.800 --> 02:28.840]  news channel every platform there is constantly because they're scared of
[02:28.840 --> 02:32.320]  what we're covering they're scared of what we're doing they're scared of
[02:32.320 --> 02:39.800]  nationalism rising and that America is back in fact Eric Trump said last night
[02:39.800 --> 02:44.680]  on Hannity quote America is back and that's why the globalists are panicking
[02:44.680 --> 02:48.840]  we also have a woman confronting Chelsea Clinton who is now the spitting
[02:48.840 --> 02:55.720]  image of Webster Hubble no doubt like all offered Chelsea Clinton a million
[02:55.720 --> 02:59.880]  dollars to the charity of her choice where she's looted billions out of Haiti
[02:59.880 --> 03:03.480]  and other places so she doesn't care a million dollars the charity of her
[03:03.480 --> 03:08.080]  choice to have a third-party group to a maternity or paternity test on her and
[03:08.080 --> 03:11.840]  you know she's Webster Hubble I mean you look at this new video we're gonna play
[03:11.840 --> 03:17.640]  when we come back it is Webster Hubble but she looks like Webster Hubble with
[03:17.640 --> 03:22.240]  her hair pulled back on this video I mean it's Webster Hubble those are some
[03:22.240 --> 03:31.240]  strong genes I mean daddy a daddy little girl right there daddy daddy girl
[03:31.240 --> 03:38.680]  that ain't Bill Clinton girl that daddy girl right there I mean I've never seen
[03:38.680 --> 03:43.640]  somebody such a spitting image of their daddy one of my daughters looks about
[03:43.640 --> 03:50.480]  90% like me but she's killing that spitting image of that daddy so that's
[03:50.480 --> 03:57.200]  coming up Eric Trump spoke Trump spoke the truth as well when he said they
[03:57.200 --> 04:00.880]  would rather see him fail and have America succeed and that's exactly what
[04:00.880 --> 04:05.800]  it's all about but I'll take it further mr. Trump they want America to fail
[04:05.800 --> 04:09.440]  that's why they hate Trump because he wants Trump to succeed don't put the
[04:09.440 --> 04:13.480]  cart before the horse the globalists want America and any free market free
[04:13.480 --> 04:17.200]  system to fail they admit that because they have a centralized system that's
[04:17.200 --> 04:23.720]  in competition with free market they have monopoly system and so they are
[04:23.720 --> 04:28.960]  desperately wanting us to fail so that's why they want Trump to fail not they
[04:28.960 --> 04:31.240]  want Trump to fail so they want America to fail
[04:31.240 --> 04:37.280]  globalism was always about making America any other powerful upwardly
[04:37.280 --> 04:42.800]  mobile dynamic free society from succeeding because that challenges the
[04:42.800 --> 04:48.160]  king makers that one centralized control I'm Alex Jones and this is the info
[04:48.160 --> 04:54.400]  war committed 110% under death in taking down the New World Order restoring the
[04:54.400 --> 05:01.120]  Republic and empowering the human species you might think the best ways to
[05:01.120 --> 05:05.320]  stop terrorism is maybe extreme bedding not allowing unbedded refugees into
[05:05.320 --> 05:08.600]  your home maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in Middle Eastern
[05:08.600 --> 05:12.760]  countries but you're all wrong in fact Hillary Clinton says the way to stop
[05:12.760 --> 05:16.720]  terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food yes really she
[05:16.720 --> 05:20.520]  also defended London mayor city con the man who once represented 911 al-Qaeda
[05:20.520 --> 05:24.680]  member Zacharias Missali called moderate Muslims uncle Tom's and said terrorism
[05:24.680 --> 05:28.680]  was part and parcel to living in a major city and she added con has shown a
[05:28.680 --> 05:31.880]  steady determined leadership Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to
[05:31.880 --> 05:34.560]  reach out to the world in order to understand people living in foreign
[05:34.560 --> 05:37.440]  countries getting to know one another learning about the experiences the
[05:37.440 --> 05:41.120]  lives the cultures the religions the food so does this mean we got to be like
[05:41.120 --> 05:44.360]  into stoning women cutting off their genitals and throwing gaze off buildings
[05:44.360 --> 05:47.960]  this is not a time to lash out to incite fear to use tragedy and terror for
[05:47.960 --> 05:51.200]  political gain said Clinton a comment obviously aimed at Donald Trump and
[05:51.200 --> 05:54.000]  anyone else was correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.960]  Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the Western world

[08:15.520 --> 08:43.640]  lines of the info or well the president son Eric has made a mistake
[08:43.640 --> 08:49.320]  Eric Trump he went on Hannity last night we're gonna play the clip here in a
[08:49.320 --> 08:57.440]  moment and he said they would rather see him fail than have America succeed
[08:57.440 --> 09:07.840]  Eric you're 95% over the target but the key twist here is the globalist admit
[09:07.840 --> 09:12.560]  they want America and free market open societies where there's real competition
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.880]  they want that to fail and that's what the UN and the globalist and the Davos
[09:17.880 --> 09:24.440]  group and all of them admit they want monopoly they want control John the
[09:24.440 --> 09:28.160]  Rockefeller the first said competitions of sin and I know you know that I know
[09:28.160 --> 09:32.120]  your father and his father your grandfather battled through all that and
[09:32.120 --> 09:36.000]  defeated some of the robber barons and folks that tried to shut you out of
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.600]  being able to operate into business in New York and I understand you know that as
[09:42.600 --> 09:47.680]  well they're not ready to go all the way out and you know point out this is by
[09:47.680 --> 09:52.680]  design meant to shut things down but your father is and that's why his speech
[09:52.680 --> 09:58.320]  last week that 35 minute speech pulling out of the Paris climate carbon tax
[09:58.320 --> 10:07.040]  accord was so important because it laid it all out and that was all fact that
[10:07.040 --> 10:11.640]  Europe in the United States in Australia have to make the carbon cuts that
[10:11.640 --> 10:17.700]  massively increase our power prices and shut down our industry and make it
[10:17.700 --> 10:22.480]  prohibitive to do manufacturing here and then India and China and Mexico and
[10:22.480 --> 10:29.520]  160 plus other countries make zero cuts and they can run dirty plants on top of
[10:29.520 --> 10:39.440]  it and finally it wasn't some esoteric Senate or house hearing where this was
[10:39.440 --> 10:45.960]  being testified to it's all there cut and dry it's outrageous so it's not that
[10:45.960 --> 10:50.640]  they just want your father to fail they want your father to fail because they
[10:50.640 --> 10:57.640]  want America to fail that's what globalism is inherently he goes on to
[10:57.640 --> 11:02.880]  say they would rather see him fail than have America succeed but that America is
[11:02.880 --> 11:09.080]  back that's what I've been telling you the last six months America is back
[11:09.080 --> 11:14.560]  fighting for its life back from the dead back from total globalist control and
[11:14.560 --> 11:20.880]  now we've got a beach in Washington Trump is absolutely real absolutely
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.400]  independent does that mean he's perfect does that mean he has all the answers
[11:24.400 --> 11:27.400]  does that mean he isn't wrong on things no does that mean he doesn't have
[11:27.400 --> 11:33.640]  distorted views compared to some of our visions absolutely but he is his own man
[11:33.640 --> 11:44.920]  he is not for austerity he does not want to screw you over and that's why the
[11:44.920 --> 11:51.120]  globalist absolutely want to destroy him they want to conquer they want to
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.160]  dominate they want to shut down the new independent media they want to take over
[11:56.160 --> 11:59.960]  the churches even further they want to tell your children what their sexual
[11:59.960 --> 12:03.920]  preference is going to be they want to run your life and turn you into a total
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.680]  slave they've tried to get you to sell out your future to Hollywood and the
[12:08.680 --> 12:13.880]  trendy culture of empty narcissism but they know many of you don't want that
[12:13.880 --> 12:18.560]  poison cup so they want to shut off your resources until you have no hope and
[12:18.560 --> 12:23.240]  engineer you and your family and destroy your children and when I say this I mean
[12:23.240 --> 12:27.240]  it from the bottom of my heart and the evidence is so overwhelming it is
[12:27.240 --> 12:37.160]  unbelievable MSM is filled with a bunch of anti-human mercenary scum heartless
[12:37.160 --> 12:43.480]  sociopathic trash that only seek raw power and control and who want to see
[12:43.480 --> 12:47.640]  you fail and they are dedicated to covering up the vaccines killing
[12:47.640 --> 12:51.960]  millions they are dedicated to covering up the GMO designed to destroy your
[12:51.960 --> 12:59.400]  fertility they are dedicated to annihilating basic human freedom they
[12:59.400 --> 13:03.440]  are pure evil and they work for the most sinister forces this planet's ever
[13:03.440 --> 13:09.120]  seen and they are the most cold-blooded over-the-top arrogant scum that think
[13:09.120 --> 13:13.040]  that they can just openly engage in all this criminal activity in front of
[13:13.040 --> 13:16.320]  everyone and openly set up private corporate world governments that will
[13:16.320 --> 13:20.880]  run every facet of your life and that you and I and all of us will just accept
[13:20.880 --> 13:26.880]  it but here's the problem they know they're beginning to fail and they know
[13:26.880 --> 13:32.840]  their grip on humanity psyche and soul and will is slipping the WikiLeaks are
[13:32.840 --> 13:37.440]  so powerful as top Democrats and others say we're losing our grip on them
[13:37.440 --> 13:42.280]  they're getting hope we've got to keep them in the dark desperate with no
[13:42.280 --> 13:46.360]  information I mean this is so evil it sounds like psychopaths talking about
[13:46.360 --> 13:50.080]  you know women or children they've gotten changes because that's who these
[13:50.080 --> 13:52.360]  people are
[13:53.280 --> 14:00.840]  lusting after dominating innocence destroying vision destroying goodness
[14:02.560 --> 14:11.440]  they want an unaware and compliant citizen free of minions but now they
[14:11.440 --> 14:17.040]  don't need us with the robots and all the rest of it coming online and so the
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.400]  soft kill the ambient
[14:22.800 --> 14:31.480]  program of cobert death is expanding and the ambient hum in the background is
[14:31.480 --> 14:39.880]  becoming a scream like being in the middle of a tornado and the world is
[14:39.880 --> 14:45.680]  waking up and as the enemy builds the nightmare system had been planning
[14:45.680 --> 14:54.040]  struggling humanity begins to find its footing and the evil ones panning but
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.240]  they will never succeed in the end and see these psychopaths these sociopaths
[14:58.240 --> 15:03.080]  these mercenaries these control freaks these these greedy people that run the
[15:03.080 --> 15:09.600]  spectrum they don't understand people that at a spiritual level wanted to
[15:09.600 --> 15:12.560]  defeat them just like they want to enslave us just like they want to hurt
[15:12.560 --> 15:16.800]  innocence we want to defend innocence just like they have no shame and no
[15:16.800 --> 15:21.920]  conscience we have shame we have a conscience but we also have the great
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.240]  exultations to do good because we understand the paradigm between our
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.160]  greater angels and our fallen self and we want to be with God and so we're
[15:31.160 --> 15:35.800]  drawn towards fighting them we're drawn towards standing against them and they
[15:35.800 --> 15:40.320]  look at us and threaten us and attack us and persecute us and try to destroy us
[15:40.320 --> 15:46.160]  and they don't understand why we don't care even though it's painful of the
[15:46.160 --> 15:50.920]  flesh it's exhilarating to the spirit
[15:53.320 --> 15:57.400]  because we know what we're doing is right and it's what got humanity this far
[15:57.400 --> 16:03.640]  through all the travails and all the crises and all of the adventures and all
[16:03.640 --> 16:09.080]  the great struggles of our species and our great history when we do the right
[16:09.080 --> 16:15.000]  thing we join our ancestors in the great quest and God's great plan the new
[16:15.000 --> 16:22.080]  world order will fail it will fall all of these arrogant sellouts that serve the
[16:22.080 --> 16:31.240]  globalist program will be punished in this life they all lie to themselves and
[16:31.240 --> 16:36.400]  think they're part of the power elite I told Megan Kelly last night well she was
[16:36.400 --> 16:39.840]  kind of snickering about world government and forced population control I
[16:39.840 --> 16:44.480]  said pediatric cancers are up over 10,000 percent 50 years ago a doctor would
[16:44.480 --> 16:48.040]  fly across the country to see a child with cancer now you go to the mall to
[16:48.040 --> 16:52.000]  your left to your right the kids have got their shaved heads they've got their
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.800]  they've got their brain surgery marks all over them I mean I go when I was in
[16:56.800 --> 17:00.160]  one restaurant there was like four kids just you tell it brain surgery
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.880]  stumbling around you know with their motor functions hacked in half whenever
[17:04.880 --> 17:09.600]  hellish testing they've gone through portable babies and I said surely surely
[17:09.600 --> 17:13.320]  by the time you're an old woman most your family will be dead from cancer and I
[17:13.320 --> 17:20.000]  said your children in a diet cancer and the people around were like whoa her
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.120]  cruise yet bigger whoa can we spend that like he's hoping they die cancer and I
[17:25.120 --> 17:31.880]  said I'm not hoping they die cancer but I said surely no that if it's 10,000 plus
[17:31.880 --> 17:38.120]  percent now that's an old number it's gonna be 20 30,000 40,000 percent just
[17:38.120 --> 17:42.720]  the next few decades it's estimated and it's going to kill your children Megan
[17:42.720 --> 17:47.760]  you're gonna outlive your children Megan and I've got children on this planet
[17:47.760 --> 17:51.600]  too as well and I want to reverse this so you think about working for those
[17:51.600 --> 17:56.080]  psychopaths go and show some pictures of her you think about working for the new

[23:58.320 --> 24:10.280]  I'm offered a million dollars to
[24:10.760 --> 24:18.720]  Bill and Hillary Clinton's supposed daughter Chelsea Hubble now we know
[24:18.720 --> 24:23.960]  Hillary is the mother she was pregnant on record and had Chelsea but that's well
[24:23.960 --> 24:27.720]  known that in the law firm her business partner was Webster Hubble and that that
[24:27.720 --> 24:34.920]  is the father and we're going to show you video of her being confronted about
[24:34.920 --> 24:39.800]  her stepfather Bill Clinton being a rapist and and with her hair pulled back
[24:39.800 --> 24:48.080]  and it is Webster Hubble to a tee so one million dollar prize that's coming up in
[24:48.080 --> 24:56.320]  the next next segment of course she has to go do a paternity test at a major
[24:56.320 --> 25:01.520]  third-party site has to all be witnessed and videotaped all's being done and then
[25:01.520 --> 25:04.920]  we have to you know actually then publish those results and we know it's
[25:04.920 --> 25:10.640]  Webster Hubble we'll need a sample from Webster Hubble as well and it's just
[25:10.640 --> 25:14.440]  insane but but the test is the face that's not Bill Clinton's daughter but
[25:14.440 --> 25:19.640]  I'm sorry I'm already jumping the gun so let's just go to that clip now then I'll
[25:19.640 --> 25:23.720]  get into Eric Trump's powerful statements dealing with the fact that
[25:23.720 --> 25:28.360]  they're trying to destroy the country and want to destroy his father in the
[25:28.360 --> 25:32.240]  process but first let's go ahead and go to this clip woman confronts Chelsea
[25:32.240 --> 25:38.280]  Clinton Bill Clinton is a rapist rebel media watch what happens when Laura
[25:38.280 --> 25:44.680]  Loomer asked Chelsea Clinton to sign a copy of her book she persisted for her
[25:44.680 --> 25:50.440]  friend Juanita Broderick here is Webster Hubble's daughter hi Chelsea hi how are
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.800]  you good because those books for everyone including women who have wanted
[25:54.800 --> 25:57.880]  to speak up but have been told to be quiet down when you sign it for my
[25:57.880 --> 26:01.000]  friend Juanita Broderick because she's been silenced by your parents especially
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.120]  Bill Clinton who's a rapist can you sign it for her you were coming to it can you
[26:05.120 --> 26:14.440]  sign it and of course that's a good question to ask but I would also have
[26:14.440 --> 26:19.880]  asked the question what about Haiti you guys took 97% of the money you kept it
[26:19.880 --> 26:23.600]  for yourself and even the WikiLeaks you tell your parents man this is wrong these
[26:23.600 --> 26:28.680]  people are dying down there in mass why are we doing this because mama and day
[26:28.680 --> 26:33.920]  needs more money sweetie and they're liberal so it's okay but if you go to
[26:33.920 --> 26:39.080]  the actual video the still they have I guess is a photo before they get up and
[26:39.080 --> 26:44.080]  shoot the video and it's just Webster Hubble's head it's the still that's up
[26:44.080 --> 26:48.280]  on info wars.com on the front page where it links through the video in the
[26:48.280 --> 26:53.680]  article and it's just incredible but you look at her it is Webster Hubble an
[26:53.680 --> 26:58.400]  absolute spitting image and it just shows how nothing we here see what the
[26:58.400 --> 27:06.520]  Clintons is real it's total fraud no that's not the one I saw this morning I
[27:06.520 --> 27:11.560]  think it's the still they use on the front page of info wars.com when you go
[27:11.560 --> 27:16.320]  to the sub page so what you would do is you would back out of that and then you
[27:16.320 --> 27:23.160]  would see it there but it's somewhere they're on the site now when we come
[27:23.160 --> 27:30.440]  back we're going to get into the big news and that's what Eric Trump's talking
[27:30.440 --> 27:35.600]  about and what the real score is and then the even bigger news massive Ramadan
[27:35.600 --> 27:41.000]  attacks everywhere including the new thing at least in Europe it's not new
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.760]  in Israel but now in greater Palestine which is England and Germany and France
[27:46.760 --> 27:53.720]  areas stolen from the Palestinians unlike London being sarcastic groups of
[27:53.720 --> 28:01.920]  women stabbing people lovingly and saying this is from Allah so that's all
[28:01.920 --> 28:06.280]  coming up after we got a break first off we've got some good news the
[28:06.280 --> 28:09.120]  information war is attempting to expand we're trying to hire a lot of new people

[29:50.240 --> 29:57.120]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.560]  you might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting not
[30:03.560 --> 30:07.280]  allowing unvetted refugees into your home maybe not trying to do so many
[30:07.280 --> 30:11.040]  regime changes in Middle Eastern countries but you're all wrong in fact
[30:11.040 --> 30:15.400]  Hillary Clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures
[30:15.400 --> 30:18.800]  and their food yes really she also defended London Mayor City Con the man
[30:18.800 --> 30:22.680]  who once represented 9-11 Al Qaeda member Zacharias Missali called moderate
[30:22.680 --> 30:26.720]  Muslims Uncle Tom's and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major
[30:26.720 --> 30:30.640]  city and she added Con has shown steady determined leadership Hillary said the
[30:30.640 --> 30:33.320]  best way to combatting terror is to reach out to the world in order to
[30:33.320 --> 30:35.960]  understand people living in foreign countries getting to know one another
[30:35.960 --> 30:40.280]  learning about the experiences the lives the cultures the religions the food so
[30:40.280 --> 30:43.600]  this mean we got to be like into stoning women cutting off their genitals and
[30:43.600 --> 30:46.920]  throwing gaze off buildings this is not a time to lash out to incite fear to use
[30:46.920 --> 30:50.560]  tragedy and terror for political gain said Clinton a comment obviously aimed
[30:50.560 --> 30:53.080]  at Donald Trump and anyone else was correctly identified political
[30:53.080 --> 30:55.920]  correctness and tolerance of Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist

[38:48.680 --> 38:53.680]  succeed that eric's almost right they want trump to fail because he wants
[38:53.680 --> 38:57.920]  america to succeed that's what his dad said last week they have carbon taxes
[38:57.920 --> 39:02.000]  on us that other countries don't have that's that is discriminatory that's
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.560]  globalism that's what the globalists have done the john mccain's of the world
[39:05.560 --> 39:10.360]  have sold us out for their own personal gain to multinationals to exploit third
[39:10.360 --> 39:17.640]  world populations so that they want us to fail let's play the eric trump clip
[39:17.640 --> 39:21.560]  from hannity last night and my father's a great man and he's going to do a great
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.440]  job for this country but honestly we need to bring some principal back we have
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.760]  to bring some manners back we need to bring some respect back it's sad he's
[39:30.760 --> 39:34.440]  going to do a great job for this nation i mean he's really he already has done a
[39:34.440 --> 39:37.920]  great job i think i'm the only person that reports the success or the things
[39:37.920 --> 39:40.840]  he's accomplished in the promises he's kept but they would they would rather see
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.640]  him they would rather see him fail than have america succeed and i've said that
[39:45.640 --> 39:50.440]  a million times i really believe that that's the ugliness of washington bc i
[39:50.440 --> 39:55.080]  can totally understand the passion that you're showing eric registered thanks
[39:55.080 --> 39:59.440]  for your congratulations on the baby too thank you very much let's continue the

[40:06.120 --> 40:09.680]  on fox business and then no one's watching that it's just a real shame
[40:09.680 --> 40:12.480]  they're killing it on purpose by the way that's admitted we told you that back in
[40:12.480 --> 40:15.840]  two years alive from insiders is not confirmed here's eric trump saying america
[40:15.840 --> 40:19.920]  is back then we're going to coursing self how about don right how about the whole
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.760]  family who's by his side every single day every single day we were sitting there
[40:24.760 --> 40:27.720]  fighting we had a very very small team i've said it from the beginning we don't
[40:27.720 --> 40:32.480]  have projects in russia we don't have loans from russia i've said this a
[40:32.480 --> 40:37.560]  thousand times we had no involvement in russia but there's no other narrative
[40:37.560 --> 40:41.560]  they don't they don't have the voice of the american people they don't have things
[40:41.560 --> 40:45.480]  that make sense for this country they did a terrible job with with jobs they
[40:45.480 --> 40:50.080]  lost industry they lost the economy i mean look look at the stock market right
[40:50.080 --> 40:54.880]  now under my father since election day the stock market is up 15 percent i mean
[40:54.880 --> 41:01.760]  15 percent since election day every confidence is at a all-time high america
[41:01.760 --> 41:05.960]  is back you see how he's treated when he goes over to the middle east versus
[41:05.960 --> 41:09.440]  obama when he came off air force one they wouldn't even bring a set of stairs
[41:09.440 --> 41:12.480]  up to the plane that's how little respect they had for this nation and
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.480]  honestly it scares the other side john it scares the other party that's right
[41:17.480 --> 41:20.600]  trump gets big respect because he really is the president now and they know he
[41:20.600 --> 41:25.280]  means business dr. coursey it's just fascinating to see how much the left how
[41:25.280 --> 41:31.040]  much the globalist really hate this country and then how truly sliming come
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.800]  he is covering up the pedo gate the real emails the real pizza gate all of that
[41:36.800 --> 41:42.080]  and now working openly against president trump what is your intel on what we
[41:42.080 --> 41:46.640]  should expect tomorrow as everybody holds their breath they got happy hour
[41:46.640 --> 41:49.760]  you know starting at 8 in the morning so everybody can watch it as if it's some
[41:49.760 --> 41:54.080]  drunken spectacle in dc and we've got coming live to congress about nsa mass
[41:54.080 --> 41:57.880]  illegal surveillance of us citizens now that's going up right now info wars
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.520]  dot com by dr. coursey everybody needs to retweet these this is an info war real
[42:02.520 --> 42:08.800]  alex jones dr. coursey well first of all i i put the this article on comey
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.920]  being a clinton fixer because i wanted very clear to set the stage and by the
[42:13.920 --> 42:18.360]  way the white house is um gonna fight back tomorrow and gonna fight back hard
[42:18.360 --> 42:24.920]  against comey but going back to whitewater when comey was involved he
[42:24.920 --> 42:28.760]  was a special counsel of the senate whitewater committee there was a big
[42:28.760 --> 42:33.680]  attempt to really suppress the information we now know from documents
[42:33.680 --> 42:37.560]  that have been released largely by judicial watch that prosecutors were
[42:37.560 --> 42:41.600]  actually writing up an indictment of hillary clinton and whitewater and it
[42:41.600 --> 42:46.880]  was stopped then it's just you go through all the cases after a whitewater
[42:46.880 --> 42:52.520]  come to the sandy burger case where sandy burger worked in the clinton
[42:52.520 --> 42:57.720]  white house was overtaking documents out of the archives that would have
[42:57.720 --> 43:03.280]  implicated clinton in knowing about the plots that ultimately became the nine
[43:03.280 --> 43:08.720]  eleven plot and doing nothing about them and of course you have a comey in an
[43:08.720 --> 43:13.720]  apartment of justice was then serving as a deputy attorney general he limited
[43:13.720 --> 43:18.040]  the click the criminal investigations of sandy burger so as to protect anybody in
[43:18.040 --> 43:22.080]  the clinton administration who may have coordinated with burger and his removal
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.680]  and destruction of classified records from the archives it goes on and on you
[43:26.680 --> 43:33.640]  find that sandy burger loretta lynch Cheryl mills all worked in this law firm
[43:33.640 --> 43:39.840]  together hogan hudson that prepared the taxes for the clintons they were all
[43:39.840 --> 43:44.800]  basically in this together and as you go forward and look at all the legal
[43:44.800 --> 43:51.480]  connections between these various groups every time there's an issue comey then
[43:51.480 --> 43:57.800]  gets on the board of hsbc he's again now dealing with lynch who is now u.s.
[43:57.800 --> 44:02.920]  attorney for the southern district of new york i find that hsbc i reported was
[44:02.920 --> 44:07.800]  engaged in a massive money laundering scheme hsbc pays a one point nine
[44:07.800 --> 44:13.880]  billion dollar fine loretta lynch excuses no criminal prosecutions and on the
[44:13.880 --> 44:20.920]  board of hsbc we find again comey was getting rewarded and the board of
[44:20.920 --> 44:24.440]  directors he served as an independent non-executive director and a member of
[44:24.440 --> 44:28.360]  the bank's financial systems vulnerability committee until he resigned in
[44:28.360 --> 44:34.920]  august 3 2013 to head the fbi and in that period of time is when the hsbc
[44:34.920 --> 44:41.080]  scandal occurred it just goes on and on the same with the valerie plain scandal
[44:41.080 --> 44:47.480]  where you know comey was involved as cross recused himself comey in the
[44:47.480 --> 44:52.200]  department justice pointed patrick Fitzgerald who ended up as a special
[44:52.200 --> 44:59.640]  prosecutor he convicted scooter liddy was then at a device president cheney
[44:59.640 --> 45:05.640]  and again as we find out that case evolved it was based on again dirty data
[45:05.640 --> 45:09.480]  lies etc that have been used to convict scout scooter liddy
[45:09.480 --> 45:14.440]  and comey was at the center of that uh comey then goes to work for the lockheed
[45:14.440 --> 45:20.040]  board he earned six million dollars between 2005 and 2010
[45:20.040 --> 45:24.920]  the clinton lockheed joins the clinton global initiative and gets 17 contracts
[45:24.920 --> 45:27.960]  from the state department while hillary clinton
[45:27.960 --> 45:31.800]  was the secretary of state so it people should make no
[45:31.800 --> 45:36.680]  doubt about it that comey is a clinton operative he's a fixer
[45:36.680 --> 45:41.080]  he's been a it there from the very beginning going back to whitewater
[45:41.080 --> 45:45.560]  and having a series of interferences with in the justice department where the
[45:45.560 --> 45:49.880]  clintons get a pass and then comey gets board positions on which he makes
[45:49.880 --> 45:53.160]  millions of dollars and also make sure the corporations are
[45:53.160 --> 45:57.400]  rewarded like hsbc getting off with a major fine but no
[45:57.400 --> 46:02.280]  criminal prosecutions and money laundering scandal and lockheed
[46:02.280 --> 46:06.120]  martin basically contributing money to the clinton global initiative and
[46:06.120 --> 46:10.200]  winning contracts from the state department this a pattern of corruption
[46:10.200 --> 46:13.320]  that should make it clear to everyone listening to comey tomorrow and the
[46:13.320 --> 46:16.440]  article is going up i'd like this article circulated the
[46:16.440 --> 46:20.520]  white house would like this information out i think we need to have
[46:20.520 --> 46:23.880]  framed comey as a clinton fixer before he starts
[46:23.880 --> 46:28.200]  testifying that's the first article alex and by the way you've done more
[46:28.200 --> 46:30.920]  research on this but it's mainstream news that he
[46:30.920 --> 46:34.360]  was involved in the big nefarious bank that he was working for the clintons
[46:34.360 --> 46:37.400]  and he was putting all these key positions and brought in by obama to
[46:37.400 --> 46:40.920]  basically cover up all the crimes they were committing he is a democrat
[46:40.920 --> 46:45.880]  operative going after trump and i just wish trump wouldn't have played nice
[46:45.880 --> 46:49.320]  and given him the benefit of the doubt i wish he'd have fired him day one
[46:49.320 --> 46:52.440]  when the democrats were saying fire him fire him fire him fire him fire him
[46:52.440 --> 46:57.320]  fire him uh but hindsight's 2020 but no evidence of this
[46:57.320 --> 47:02.040]  russian narrative uh and you know the uh what about comey
[47:02.040 --> 47:06.680]  contradicting himself on may 3rd from the supposed memo that nobody
[47:06.680 --> 47:11.240]  can see from back in february uh and saying that no one
[47:11.240 --> 47:14.200]  you know ever tried to influence him on the russian investigation and then
[47:14.200 --> 47:17.640]  supposedly contradicting himself with this memo
[47:17.640 --> 47:21.000]  well there's several things that he can't contradict first of all
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.920]  i want to comment also i've been running a major campaign on my twitter account
[47:24.920 --> 47:28.280]  which is drome underscore coursey and i'll be writing about it and
[47:28.280 --> 47:31.960]  as soon as i get a chance alex i've quite frankly been writing non-stop
[47:31.960 --> 47:36.600]  for about 10 days about 10 hours a day to try just get all this information
[47:36.600 --> 47:40.440]  out um but there's a major move to replace
[47:40.440 --> 47:45.000]  previs and i had as as the chief of staff the major problem the white house has
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.040]  got is previs is a toadie with his connections in the
[47:50.040 --> 47:55.000]  gop establishment in dc his meal ticket is ryan and
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.840]  mcconnell and what i've been advising through the
[47:58.840 --> 48:02.520]  twitter feed is that first of all uh
[48:02.520 --> 48:05.800]  president obama's gotta realize he's in the middle of a coup d'etat that's being
[48:05.800 --> 48:09.960]  engineered by the deep state with the cooperation
[48:09.960 --> 48:14.520]  of the democratic party full cooperation and the gop establishment in dc
[48:14.520 --> 48:16.760]  you're talking about president trump has to understand that
[48:16.760 --> 48:19.880]  president trump is getting in the middle of a coup d'etat
[48:19.880 --> 48:23.640]  is being engineered and they intend to impeach him
[48:23.640 --> 48:29.560]  now previs doesn't have if previs loses his job or whatever if trump is
[48:29.560 --> 48:33.480]  impeached previs just goes to work for another one of the
[48:33.480 --> 48:37.560]  gop establishments it's his meal ticket he calls up ryan and mcconnell and gets
[48:37.560 --> 48:41.880]  another job uh previs is not loyal he's not strong
[48:41.880 --> 48:46.040]  he's botched everything in fact the the major problems the
[48:46.040 --> 48:50.360]  trump white house is experiencing is they do not have an effective chief of
[48:50.360 --> 48:53.720]  staff well we keep hearing that that there's a big shake-up imminent
[48:53.720 --> 48:57.400]  do you think trumps just waiting till this fbi uh hearing comes up and of
[48:57.400 --> 49:01.640]  course also trumps announces new uh fbi director christopher
[49:01.640 --> 49:05.320]  ray i guess is a way to overshadow this hearing tomorrow
[49:05.320 --> 49:08.360]  i think it's a part of just getting things in place i mean
[49:08.360 --> 49:13.400]  they're under such assault and from within and there's so many yet holdovers
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.000]  from clinton and obama and even in the
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.680]  trump white house that you know i'm pounding on every day to get rid of
[49:22.680 --> 49:25.560]  but let's go back to the comey for tomorrow i want to make sure we get
[49:25.560 --> 49:29.400]  this second article in that you know basically comey's lied to congress a
[49:29.400 --> 49:32.760]  number of times first of all they have no evidence
[49:32.760 --> 49:37.080]  that there's been any russian colic collusion this is a complete
[49:37.080 --> 49:42.120]  propaganda effort being run by the democrats but what we do know is that

[54:09.640 --> 54:12.520]  garrison cartoon out with queen hillary on it
[54:12.520 --> 54:17.400]  and it's got the dozens i guess 20 or so reasons she's publicly put out
[54:17.400 --> 54:21.400]  that she lost the election russia wiki leaks
[54:21.400 --> 54:27.000]  um none of it's hillary clinton alex jones
[54:27.480 --> 54:33.800]  she goes on to say that trump loomed misogyny the polls

[54:45.160 --> 54:48.440]  back in the next segment and and get more into the coma lying and admittedly
[54:48.440 --> 54:52.360]  the spying and how big a liar he is i mean he's been caught red-handed
[54:52.360 --> 54:56.200]  two months after he does this memo telling congress nobody tried to
[54:56.200 --> 54:59.400]  influence him period was laughing about it saying it's
[54:59.400 --> 55:02.920]  preposterous it's ridiculous but but again the media just ignores that even
[55:02.920 --> 55:05.880]  writes articles saying that it's a hoax it's not real video
[55:05.880 --> 55:09.960]  i mean they must really think we're stupid but i've seen it the polls but
[55:09.960 --> 55:13.800]  i've also seen it on the street about two weeks ago people started really
[55:13.800 --> 55:16.920]  turning against the russia narrative i mean they never bought it but they
[55:16.920 --> 55:20.920]  force fed it so hard that even mainstream news is
[55:20.920 --> 55:24.840]  admitting it's becoming a huge joke and people are sick of it but the neocons
[55:24.840 --> 55:27.720]  the rhinos the democrats the deep state they don't care
[55:27.720 --> 55:31.640]  they're going forward sharpening their knives what's the word on the street in
[55:31.640 --> 55:35.640]  dc because trump just keeps delivering delivering on the economy
[55:35.640 --> 55:39.560]  spectacular pulling out of the paris global carbon tax
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.080]  and the democrats respond just everywhere saying we're going to kill him
[55:43.080 --> 55:46.120]  in fact here's an info wars dot com article c watson
[55:46.120 --> 55:49.640]  play in the new york features donald trump being stabbed to death
[55:49.640 --> 55:54.200]  and then you've got obviously the a la oct bar stuff and you've got
[55:54.200 --> 55:57.400]  griffin kathy griffin running around with a severed head i mean
[55:57.400 --> 56:02.280]  these people are really pushing for violent confrontations with everybody
[56:02.280 --> 56:07.560]  like somebody trying to talk themselves and to jump it off the edge of a cliff
[56:07.560 --> 56:11.080]  well what's going on i mean that's with even within the white house first of
[56:11.080 --> 56:14.600]  all uh trump is coming to realize that he's
[56:14.600 --> 56:18.040]  this is serious business this is not new york anymore
[56:18.040 --> 56:23.320]  this is not business this is this is this is politics in washington dc this is
[56:23.320 --> 56:27.000]  war it's cutthroat and it and the deep state
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.160]  the intelligence agencies are out to get impeachment
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.320]  the democrats have joined them and the g lp establishments there
[56:35.320 --> 56:39.480]  and let's be clear though it's it's the rogue network shadow government
[56:39.480 --> 56:43.960]  democrat and foundation elites at the top on average the intelligence agencies
[56:43.960 --> 56:47.880]  and the military behind trump well and see the point is
[56:47.880 --> 56:50.840]  first let's just take the issue you know we've got
[56:50.840 --> 56:54.680]  credentials and we've got to apply for them every week okay the word i've gotten
[56:54.680 --> 56:58.280]  from high authorities is that previs is blocking
[56:58.280 --> 57:01.720]  and wants to block in for warsome getting permanent credentials
[57:01.720 --> 57:05.160]  and is saying that we're not a legitimate news agency
[57:05.160 --> 57:08.600]  now they've got into the white house press room
[57:08.600 --> 57:11.960]  the front row by the way that's a small little stupid room
[57:11.960 --> 57:15.800]  was where jack kennedy used to do naked swimming with his girlfriends from the
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.200]  interns in the white house that it's been converted into the press room
[57:20.200 --> 57:24.840]  it's it's inadequate for a facility a mainstream media is given the front row
[57:24.840 --> 57:29.080]  to do an act up anti-trump hour televised every day
[57:29.080 --> 57:32.040]  trumps got to get rid of it moving to a bigger building and we've talked about
[57:32.040 --> 57:34.520]  that and previs is in there keeping it that way
[57:34.520 --> 57:40.280]  and why isn't the president uh giving us uh you know the the the fireside chat
[57:40.280 --> 57:44.120]  he's got to bypass these enemies now well he's also got to get rid of
[57:44.120 --> 57:46.600]  previs he's got to get rid of these people out of the white house
[57:46.600 --> 57:49.640]  i understand that but let me ask you you have a lot of white house contacts
[57:49.640 --> 57:52.680]  and i know it's getting to the president why isn't he doing at least a weekly
[57:52.680 --> 57:55.400]  fireside chat now well he should be i mean his
[57:55.400 --> 57:58.200]  twitter is essentially amount to it his tweets
[57:58.200 --> 58:01.960]  yesterday the press attacked the tweets they want to get him to stop tweeting
[58:01.960 --> 58:05.720]  because he goes directly to the people that's the modern day equivalent of the
[58:05.720 --> 58:08.520]  fireside chats and they're very effective they do
[58:08.520 --> 58:12.280]  reach people trumps still has the support of the electorate
[58:12.280 --> 58:15.720]  but that's not good enough in washington if you don't have
[58:15.720 --> 58:20.280]  you're you know you've got to do like london johnson did in terms of
[58:20.280 --> 58:24.520]  power politics in washington sam rayburn these are the guys who understood
[58:24.520 --> 58:27.880]  how to run washington and you do it with power so
[58:27.880 --> 58:30.760]  previs comes around he says you know i'm going to help you i know all about
[58:30.760 --> 58:34.200]  congress i can make sure and the truth is he's sabotaging him
[58:34.200 --> 58:38.440]  trump has to start crushing people one by one legitimately by showing how they
[58:38.440 --> 58:42.120]  hate america he needs to destroy people one by one
[58:42.120 --> 58:49.480]  starting with paul ryan we'll be right back in 60 seconds

[59:20.040 --> 59:23.640]  super compact and lightweight there's a reason the department of defense

[59:50.120 --> 1:00:10.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:21.480]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:26.120]  make no mistake this country is that it's most historic moments in 1776 and
[1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:28.760]  now the world's future hangs in the balance
[1:00:28.760 --> 1:00:33.880]  mistakes couldn't be higher and
[1:00:34.520 --> 1:00:37.560]  if you told me 10 years ago donald trump will be at the center of it i would
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:41.000]  just roll my eyes and laugh at you
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.280]  but studying trump knowing his history understanding that he was just doing
[1:00:44.280 --> 1:00:48.520]  business and being a pr guy with that persona and then the real persona going
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:51.400]  back to when he was in college is being an anti-new
[1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:54.680]  world order patriot and to now see where we are in this
[1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:58.840]  country and to see how many people support the president but they have to
[1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:03.880]  understand how life and death this is this is war and the globalist
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:06.360]  want to continue to run this country and they're panicked
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:09.480]  but it is tell-tale how much respect he got especially in the middle east of
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:11.880]  the areas people act like they're scared of
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:15.160]  trump over there because they understand that he just took control of
[1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:18.120]  this bureaucracy that had no respect for our country
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:21.640]  and people don't respect people that have sold out they respect people that
[1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:25.560]  are actually for real dr. coursey well this is exactly right i mean this is
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:29.240]  trump has never been in a game like this before
[1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:32.440]  uh it's different on wall street it's different in new york
[1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:36.840]  he's built buildings he's fought the unions this is the deep state
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:39.960]  this is they'll lie they'll swear they'll under oath
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:44.040]  comey will lie they are lying this morning to the
[1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:47.320]  senate intelligence committee they're begging to be in
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:52.600]  privates you know closed testimony where they can
[1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:56.120]  you'll not be held accountable for what they're saying
[1:01:56.120 --> 1:02:01.160]  this is a disgrace and these they trump has got to understand
[1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:04.200]  when the g.o.p leadership comes and meets with them in the
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:07.800]  white house they're gonna all nod and smile they go out of there they sharpen
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:10.440]  their knives and they want to they're just as happy to carve donald
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:13.080]  trump up and throw him into the patomic river
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:17.000]  and this is a this is a life-and-death fight i mean you know the
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:22.520]  jack kennedy underestimated him too i was part of the group as a very young
[1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:25.640]  kid i mean teenager trying to warn jack kennedy of
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:29.000]  the danger jack didn't perceive it either trump better listen
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:33.320]  and bobby didn't even act like bobby didn't even have to kill his brother
[1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:38.600]  well um there was an attempt i i never did like bobby as well as i got to like
[1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:42.760]  jack but there was an attempt to save bobby too bobby was a very stubborn guy
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:49.400]  i knew him reasonably well um but jack kennedy would listen but he didn't
[1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:53.320]  really perceive the extent of the danger that was he was facing for the deep
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:56.440]  state where they decided to remove him from power
[1:02:56.440 --> 1:03:00.520]  and what's going on right now is trump is in the middle of a coup d'etat
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:05.240]  and he better quickly smarten up and realize that it's going to be a power
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:08.120]  game and he's going to have to be able to get
[1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:11.320]  control of the rnc get control of the money
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.560]  you know lindon johnson would put his nose right up against your nose and

[1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:31.240]  how washington works if he doesn't control the power of these committees
[1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:37.640]  uh these moles within uh but within the fbi within the department of justice
[1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:42.040]  within the white house the the soros operatives the clinton and
[1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:45.960]  obama loyalists they will destroy his presidency
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:50.520]  and it's it's under war it's underway right now this is a serious threat
[1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:54.280]  we're facing it you know the the media that got trump
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:58.280]  in and trump is tweeting he's saying if he'd listen to the new york times in the
[1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:01.560]  you know the the washington post the like he'd never be president well he better
[1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:05.240]  figure out right now to get him out of the front row of that press room
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:09.080]  close that press room down well exactly and from slendovitch and my other
[1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:14.200]  sources a month ago we had the headline uh patriots are about to be really
[1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:17.880]  pleased with what trump does and he has made a more
[1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:22.120]  populist turn and he understands that's what he's got to do now but but come
[1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:24.440]  back we've got another guest coming up i'll give you a few more minutes to talk
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:27.560]  about briefly what else you think he should do is a plan of
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:31.640]  action but there it is patriots will be very happy
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:35.160]  uh with what trump is about to do and that was a
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:38.600]  month ago on or a little less than a month ago may
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:43.400]  15th it's now june 7th so again you can watch that we also had articles that
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:46.760]  they're breaking all this down that was your own course is our guest
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:50.360]  writer with info wars dot com the articles come he lied to congress by
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:53.480]  nsa mass illegal surveillance of u.s citizens including
[1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:57.720]  donald trump and alex jones and fbi confirmed come he was
[1:04:57.720 --> 1:05:01.320]  planted inside of the clinton's you might think the best ways to stop
[1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:03.960]  terrorism is maybe extreme bedding not allowing
[1:05:03.960 --> 1:05:07.880]  unbedded refugees into your home maybe not trying to do so many regime changes
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:10.920]  in middle eastern countries love you're all wrong in fact
[1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:15.240]  hillary clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures
[1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:18.360]  and their food yes really she also defended london mayor city con the
[1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:22.040]  man who once represented 9 11 al-qaeda member zacharias massouli called
[1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:26.040]  moderate muslim's uncle tom's and said terrorism was part and parcel to living
[1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:29.800]  in a major city and she added con has shown steady determined leadership
[1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:32.760]  hillary said the best way to combatting terror is to reach out to the world in
[1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:35.480]  order to understand people living in foreign countries getting to know one
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:39.320]  another learning about the experiences the lives the cultures the religions the
[1:05:39.320 --> 1:05:42.840]  food so does this mean we got to be like into stoning women cutting off their
[1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:45.720]  genitals and throwing gaze off buildings this is not a time to lash out to
[1:05:45.720 --> 1:05:49.640]  incite fear to use tragedy and terror for political gain said clinton a comment
[1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:52.440]  obviously aimed at donald trump and anyone else who's correctly identified
[1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:55.320]  political correctness and tolerance of islam as creating a fertile ground for
[1:05:55.320 --> 1:05:58.600]  terrorist attacks in the western world rob your reporting for info wars nightly

[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:35.160]  names of the treasonous republicans that are

[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:48.760]  there comes a time when it becomes necessary to draw the line of sand
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:53.880]  when you look at the agenda of hollywood and the globalist i mean it is so
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:58.600]  nightmarish and they're allied with the most horrible forms of islam
[1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:01.240]  you know these people are the scum of the earth
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:05.160]  dr corcy whose work with presidents obviously and is the best-selling
[1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:08.440]  author and journalist and works for info wars has filed two reports that are
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:14.600]  on info wars dot com right now it's confirmed komi was implanted the fbi
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:17.880]  by the clintons there's a report up there going
[1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:22.760]  over all the admissions of that we need to get that meme out there that
[1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:25.640]  komi is a clinton operative to tweet that article
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:29.880]  from info wars dot com to facebook at you name it to push it out to everybody
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:33.720]  so they understand what this is about and then also a fact
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:37.560]  we have the video of this as well we should make this the big lead to not
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:41.400]  on the nightly news komi lied to congress just like clapper
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:44.600]  about nsa mass surveillance of u.s citizens including donald trump and
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:47.960]  holland shones and said it was insane said it was kooky
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:52.600]  said it was unbelievable this is when the democrats were all over the news
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:56.440]  saying we've surveilled trump we know we talked to the russians trump said
[1:09:56.440 --> 1:09:59.800]  that's illegal if you did that to leak that of course they didn't have the
[1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:04.040]  intel so they used the claim they had it to put that out but they had been
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:07.480]  surveilling so they're the ones committing the
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:10.680]  crimes and we've seen this one lady and we'll get
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:13.560]  into what trump should do
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:18.440]  who was inside the federal government who said that she hates white people even
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:21.320]  though she's white the white should be genocided
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:24.680]  and that she's one of the people that's part of this army that michael more is
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:27.880]  creating saying whistle blow well whistle blowing is if you're
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:32.760]  exposing something illegal but if you're
[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:36.680]  leaking national security information and you're leaking
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:40.280]  stuff mixed in with lies it's totally illegal but then have michael more
[1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:45.960]  organizing it saying it's to overthrow trump is incredible accused leaker
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:51.080]  last name winner called trump an orange fascist on twitter that's
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:54.920]  cnn's whitewash we actually read her website
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:58.600]  paul wasen wrote about it yesterday and read her facebook and stuff she says
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:03.000]  white people need to all be genocided this is the type of mental patient
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.400]  filling the federal government right now and they're all saying leak leak leak
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:13.160]  leak to the point of we can't even get intelligence on terror attacks
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:17.480]  in england because they leak it to sabotage trump within minutes
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:21.240]  just to stop everything he does and bring the country down because they don't
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:24.760]  want to just bring trump down they want to bring him down because he wants to
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:28.840]  restore the republic the globalists want to run this
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:32.520]  country they want to dominate it what does the president need to do
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:35.720]  right now because his approval ratings are up even in these skewed polls
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:39.000]  he's turned the corner he's delivering on the economy
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.440]  you can feel the momentum shifting towards trump a lot of experts agree with
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:45.480]  me but that's only making the deep state become more
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:47.640]  desperate is that what you're saying corsie
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:50.920]  if they're getting more desperate and getting more determined to
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:54.600]  write the articles of impeachment right now this is what this is about
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:11:58.760]  that's what's hoped to be achieved tomorrow with james komie's testimony
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:02.360]  uh this is serious trump's got to act fairly quickly
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:06.680]  and he's got to clean out the white house starting with previs
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:10.040]  it's got to start exerting power he's got to start acting
[1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:15.240]  as a strong president uh a linden johnson type strong president i'm not
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:19.480]  saying we need to be at now i'm not advocating a war i'm advocating the
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:22.920]  use of the executive office in a way that uh
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:26.440]  washington will respect right now washington thinks they can walk all
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:30.760]  over trump they think he's um i'm a minor actor they
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:34.520]  think he's completely out of his league i've known
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:37.480]  down trump for a long time he's a very quick learner
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:40.920]  but he and he always gets behind the curve like this he always looks like he's
[1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:45.320]  going to lose right up until he wins but you know instead
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:48.840]  of having in the front row of that press office
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:53.960]  with an anti trump act up our every day they had to close that press room
[1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:57.240]  they had to get info wars in there full time and others
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:13:01.320]  like info wars that helped elect trump got to really if he doesn't realize who
[1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:04.760]  his friends are right now donald trump and i mean this
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:10.680]  in this cold seriousness as i can say uh if the deep state doesn't find a way to
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:13.080]  assassinate them they'll find a way to impeach him
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:16.360]  and it's about that it's that's what's at stake right now
[1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:19.800]  i'll talk let me bring this in then let me bring this in
[1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:23.640]  if you're looking at trump you see at the state department
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:27.480]  he orders them under law to stop bringing in people from seven countries
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:30.760]  that have total failed states where the imams issue the passports
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:33.960]  because you are a terrorist you know they give you a passport and then we let
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:37.800]  them in and vet it this is completely insane the courts are blocking him the
[1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:40.920]  state department's blocking him as you have reported here
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:45.320]  he is complaining about that himself what does he do i have a crew of like 70
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:48.120]  people they're great folks but i can't seem to get a lot of
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:51.720]  stuff done sometimes with a crew that is really smart and
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:54.280]  means well i mean how does he do this with such a
[1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:58.360]  servile weak group of people in dc from both parties
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:01.240]  that are all not going to show up to work tomorrow and get drunk
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:06.360]  and watch uh you know the comey hearings with the happy hour bars opening at eight
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:09.880]  a.m uh the only way dc works is that they're
[1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:13.160]  afraid of you he's got to take control of the rnc he's
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:17.000]  got to get control of the money he's got to make it clear to ryan ryan's no
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:21.640]  longer in charge of handing out who gets the money to be reelected
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:26.040]  uh trumps got to start enforcing party discipline from the white house
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:30.200]  same way linden johnson did he's got to start using the telephone calling up
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:34.600]  people uh the state department any of these agencies
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:38.840]  fire them by half get rid of people get rid of anybody who's got a
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:43.320]  resume or pedigree from obama or clinton get him out of the white house
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:47.240]  i've trump doesn't have loyalists around him if he doesn't have people who are
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:51.080]  going to fight for him he's going to lose the presidency
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:55.480]  and as much as um for trump this is the this is the strongest warning i've
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:59.240]  ever issued because i've never seen it they're going to start writing articles
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:03.240]  of impeachment based on a lie and they're going to try to
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:06.440]  ram it through with the mainstream media that trump is inviting into the white
[1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:09.560]  house every day for an hour televised to sit in that
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:13.240]  front row that stupid little room and argue that trump
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:18.120]  doesn't know what he's doing to create some new story out of a gotcha question
[1:15:18.120 --> 1:15:22.280]  and it's disgraceful and it's got to stop trump has the ability to stop it

[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:49.160]  him because they've got all these conservative talk show hosts
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:52.920]  kind of riding the fence here and we're going to lose everything
[1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:56.200]  if people keep riding the fence dr coursey powerful articles

[1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:23.320]  there because that's the real revolution trump's just a front line
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:29.960]  battering ram and god-loving but all of us running for
[1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:33.080]  mayor running for dog catcher running for school board

[1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:46.760]  look at all this right now michael snider thanks for coming on with us
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:50.280]  what do you want to tackle first the big hearings coming up tomorrow the state of
[1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:53.400]  the union the huge ramadan attacks happening everywhere
[1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:57.480]  on the left trying to make excuses for it i mean it's just
[1:16:57.480 --> 1:17:01.720]  hard to believe how villainous they are but also let's be frank
[1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:06.120]  how weak and passive we are because most libertarian or conservative men
[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:08.760]  they say oh thanks for what you're doing well i appreciate them at least they're
[1:17:08.760 --> 1:17:12.120]  awake in care but don't they understand they've got to be involved
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:16.680]  they've got to be doing stuff every day in this fight we have serious
[1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:24.680]  hardcore totalitarianism with a whole communist slash satanic
[1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:30.280]  undertone taking over we have true evil facing us
[1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:34.360]  we do alex and as a global system that wants to destroy us
[1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:38.200]  while we engage the other side and and we believe they should have freedom of
[1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:41.560]  speech they want to take our freedom of speech completely away they want to
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:44.280]  shut us up they want to say what you're doing is hate
[1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:47.640]  speech they want to say what i'm doing is hate speech they want to criminalize
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:51.320]  what we're doing shut us up make us go away and eventually the
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:54.600]  hardcore among them want to do kind of what kathy griffin did when she held up
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:58.120]  that bloody head of trump they literally some of the most hardcore
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:01.720]  they if they got their way that they would kill us
[1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:05.160]  but you know the the less hardcore among them just want to shut us up
[1:18:05.160 --> 1:18:09.640]  criminalize us and throw us in prison basically eliminate us we want to defeat
[1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:12.840]  the other side because we believe in freedom of speech we believe in the
[1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:15.880]  u.s constitution the other side we need to understand they
[1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:18.840]  don't believe in that they believe in total
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:22.840]  scorched earth ultimate victory where if they ultimately get their way
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:27.480]  they want to eradicate our way of life they want to eradicate our worldview
[1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:30.600]  and totally eliminate us that's their ultimate goal
[1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:35.160]  and that's why strong cities doesn't make sense to have the u.n here lecturing
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.000]  us saying federalize globalize our police bullying cops
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:42.280]  funding people to go out randomly kill cops they think the cops are weak
[1:18:42.280 --> 1:18:45.240]  they think the cop unions are weak they think we're weak they think the american
[1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:47.240]  people are weak they think they're going to roll over
[1:18:47.240 --> 1:18:50.920]  to this globalist policing and be their enforcers if they kill enough of them
[1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:55.000]  and i'm going to ask the cops something right now what are you doing to stand up
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.400]  against this okay i know you don't have all the power in the world
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:01.400]  but every man and woman out there we know the score now people there's no more
[1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:05.800]  excuses this country is under total attack sorry go ahead
[1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:09.080]  oh it's true we need to understand yeah we've gotten donald trump into the
[1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:13.080]  white house but this liberal world order and that that's
[1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:16.120]  this is a term that's starting to be used by the washington post it was used by
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:19.320]  joe biden and hence final speech at the world economic
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:22.920]  forum but this liberal world order this new world order
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:25.880]  you know donald trump may control the white house but
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:29.240]  everything else in washington pretty much is still dominated by them
[1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:32.920]  they dominate the mainstream media they dominate the court system and that's one
[1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:36.680]  of their most powerful tools where they get their agenda implemented because
[1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:41.000]  they dominate the the legal system in this country totally crave
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:45.480]  power they don't produce economies of scale economies
[1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:50.360]  of ideas economies of products innovation socialism collectivism always
[1:19:50.360 --> 1:19:54.440]  begins to create masses of people that specialize in scamming
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:58.360]  specialize in taking things over specialize in making people pay
[1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:02.920]  kickbacks and we're becoming mexico we're becoming eastern europe
[1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:06.680]  we're becoming those corrupt systems that no matter how rich the culture
[1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:11.800]  no matter how many resources they have it creates a giant mass of poor people
[1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:16.360]  by design this is the globalist model and it's why they hate trump
[1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:19.800]  declaring tpp a fraud declaring the carbon tax
[1:20:19.800 --> 1:20:23.480]  a system to make us poor because it is it is
[1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:27.400]  and it's so incredible to realize we're to this point
[1:20:27.400 --> 1:20:33.160]  michael yeah and this is why control freaks are drawn to the system
[1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:37.640]  like moss to a flame and particularly they love to go to law school law school
[1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:40.440]  i've called seminary for liberals because
[1:20:40.440 --> 1:20:43.880]  that you know that it's kind of their religion and so that
[1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:47.080]  you know for example i went to law school down at the university of florida
[1:20:47.080 --> 1:20:50.920]  and you think that florida you know northern florida kind of conservative but
[1:20:50.920 --> 1:20:54.920]  no the student body was extremely liberal but even more liberal as the
[1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:58.760]  professors in fact among all the dozens of professors that taught at the school
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:03.160]  there was only one republican but there are all kinds of lesbians and radical
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:06.840]  leftists and this was the university of florida this wasn't the ivy league
[1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:10.440]  but this is what our legal system has become they also dominate the system of
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:13.640]  education from all the way from kindergarten all the way up through our
[1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:17.400]  university system it's an elite it's an elite and then
[1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:21.400]  they pick the broken strategy broken coalition strategy
[1:21:21.400 --> 1:21:25.640]  of all these subgroups that they then rule over a sexual preference or over
[1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:28.360]  this or over that and then they just rule those groups
[1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:32.280]  in their little fiefdoms this is pure social engineering this just broke
[1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:35.160]  on info wars dot com it broke in the last 10 minutes
[1:21:35.160 --> 1:21:40.760]  here it is ladies and gentlemen this is from the associated press
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:44.040]  congressman starts impeachment process against president trump
[1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:47.480]  representative algreen a texas democrat who said he would do this previously
[1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:50.520]  said he's writing articles of impeachment against donald trump the first
[1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:52.920]  official step to remove a sitting president
[1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:56.440]  so it's just like bob bar kicked it off in georgia against bill clinton
[1:21:56.440 --> 1:22:00.120]  this is now being kicked off in texas truly shameful green took to the house
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:03.720]  floor last month to call the impeachment of the president for what he said was
[1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:07.720]  obstruction of justice in connection to the firing of fp i james komie
[1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:11.800]  who was investigating ties between trump's presidential campaign in russia
[1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:14.920]  komie is set to testify tomorrow for the senate committee on his
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:19.320]  interactions with trump the facts are simple and indisputable
[1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:22.760]  the moon is made of cheese i mean sorry the facts are simple and indisputable
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:25.800]  we lost the election and we're tyrants we can't handle it i'm sorry i was
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:28.920]  translating for you the facts are simple and indisputable
[1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:31.400]  we wanted to overthrow america and hate the second amendment i'm sorry that's
[1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:34.600]  wrong uh the facts are simple and indisputable the president and fbi
[1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:37.720]  director because the director was investigating the president's
[1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:40.840]  presidential connections to russia interfered the presidential election
[1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:44.840]  green said in a statement this is obstruction of justice the articles are
[1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:48.280]  mostly symbolic and highly unlikely to go anywhere in the republican's role
[1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:51.480]  house green has not yet officially introduced them and then right after that
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:56.040]  came out there's this headline top dems reject impeachment push
[1:22:56.040 --> 1:22:59.240]  adam schiff we have to find out what the facts are
[1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:02.040]  the senior democrat on the house and tells us too many said but still they
[1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:04.920]  don't have the facts this is all just a bunch of maneuvering
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:08.280]  these people are truly transparent michael schneider
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:12.120]  oh it's true and this is a nothing scandal because alex
[1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:15.800]  even if every single thing that komie is claiming is true
[1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:19.320]  even if every single thing that he's claiming is true and that's a big if
[1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:22.760]  then there's still no obstruction of justice for example you look at the
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:25.960]  main statute that governs obstruction of justice that's
[1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:31.480]  18 usc 1503 now there's certain elements that have to be proven in a case for
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:34.280]  obstruction of justice one is that there has to be some
[1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:38.280]  sort of official proceeding now in this case there's not any of that
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:41.080]  there's simply a conversation between donald trump
[1:23:41.080 --> 1:23:46.120]  and james komie in the oval office now the if donald trump did
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:49.640]  you know do everything that komie is saying it may have been improper it may
[1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:52.760]  have been inappropriate but it's not criminal there was not an
[1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:57.240]  official proceeding secondly that it also must be proven that
[1:23:57.240 --> 1:24:02.120]  that of trump corruptly tried to influence the proceedings there
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:06.120]  must be a a a proving of corruptness and there
[1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:11.000]  that doesn't appear to be the case here so and it's not just my opinion but
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:16.200]  allen dirshowitz jonathan turley both extremely liberal well-known
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:19.400]  minds in the legal world but very very liberal
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:23.000]  very much on the left but they agree with me that even if everything is true
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:26.520]  that they're claiming there's no obstruction of justice here there's no
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:30.440]  evidence of any crime that trump has committed even if he colluded with the
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:33.720]  russians that's not criminal you know even if he did
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:37.640]  a leak intelligence to the russians from israel that's
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:42.280]  that's not that's not criminal there's nothing here that's criminal so it's a
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:45.240]  nothing scandal sure and let's look at how the media
[1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:48.600]  investigation look how the media is constantly leaking
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:51.480]  classified stuff but it's it's okay when they do it
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:55.240]  he's the president but case by case point
[1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:57.800]  he didn't leak where the submarines were in south korea
[1:24:57.800 --> 1:25:01.880]  he didn't leak information about laptop bombs and ices that was known two months
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:05.160]  before and all over the news this is ridiculous
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:08.200]  oh it absolutely is but what that what they want to do
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:12.280]  is they want to destroy donald trump as dr drum course he was just talking
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:15.720]  about and so donald trump he's kind of a bull in a china shop but he's walking
[1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:18.680]  through a minefield because i've explained on the program before
[1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:22.600]  there's literally thousands of laws that could apply to the executive branch
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:27.320]  and all these sharks are just waiting and watching him like a hawk
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:30.760]  to see if he'll step on one of these landmines so they can get them and so
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:34.200]  right now they're going to try to let this impeachment thing kind of would go
[1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:37.400]  with a slow burn but in terms of what the democrats
[1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:40.440]  what i'm hearing and what they're saying in their fundraising letters and among
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:43.960]  their their rank and file is that right now okay they're going to let this
[1:25:43.960 --> 1:25:46.440]  thing go with kind of a slow burn but they're really
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:50.680]  targeting 2018 because their plan is for there to be an anti-trump backlash
[1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:54.280]  for them to take the house and the senate and then that'll be their golden
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:57.960]  opportunity to strike with impeachment so they're going to let this thing build
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:01.320]  and if they get some you know just a golden opportunity
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:05.320]  you know they'll go ahead right now but if not if they have to they'll wait till
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:08.200]  2018 let it kind of build up and then they get their
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:11.720]  majorities in both houses of congress and then strike and try to take them out
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:15.160]  that's right michael and they also brag
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:19.400]  that bottom line they paralyze his agenda he never gets to meet with putin
[1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:23.400]  he never gets to take out radical islam they want to block that because they're
[1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:26.280]  allied with it so bare minimum they paralyze him
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:29.480]  where if the ambassador from russia or the foreign minister comes to the
[1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:31.800]  winehouse look he took him in a back room look
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:35.240]  at secret look he's giving him secrets he's a spy
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:38.120]  acting like the president can't go behind closed doors
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:41.720]  with the russian ambassador that's as normal as breathing when you're the
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:43.960]  president that's what the president does but again
[1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:48.920]  they think the public's dumb like gruber said thank god they're so dumb they
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:52.120]  don't know we're going to triple prices thank god they're so stupid they're
[1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:56.680]  like goldfish they're so pathetic ha ha ha i got hired to lie to them
[1:26:56.680 --> 1:27:01.400]  they're so proud of themselves because they're the filth they're the scum

[1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:21.560]  dark their heart must be to say things like that the russians
[1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:26.520]  ran an extensive information war campaign
[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:32.040]  against my campaign to influence voters in the election
[1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:36.280]  and then they began to weaponize them and they began to
[1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:44.040]  have some of their allies within the uh internet world like info wars take out
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:47.960]  pieces and began to say the most outrageous outlandish
[1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:53.000]  absurd lies you can imagine but trump doesn't challenge these lies
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:58.680]  he actually went on jones's show and said your reputation is amazing i will not

[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:23.800]  women who have wanted to speak up but have been told to the quiet downs when
[1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:26.680]  you sign up for my friend wanita broadwick because she's been silenced by
[1:34:26.680 --> 1:34:30.520]  your parents especially bill plinton who's a rapist can you sign up for her
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:33.240]  you were coming today can you sign it
[1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:37.240]  thanks hey sean how are you wish you went to
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:40.520]  washington so you could be dealing with us every second of every day you know
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:44.120]  what i've never seen hatred like this i mean to me they're not even people
[1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:47.720]  it's it's so so sad i mean morality's just gone
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:50.920]  um morals have flown out the window we deserve so much better
[1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:54.200]  than this as a country and you know it's so sad you see the democratic party
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:56.680]  they're imploding they're imploding they have no message
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:35:01.000]  you see the head of the dnc who was a total whack job there's no
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:04.840]  leadership there and so what do they do they become obstructionist because they
[1:35:04.840 --> 1:35:07.880]  have no message of their own they have no solid candidates
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:10.520]  of their own they lost the election that they should have won because they
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:15.160]  spent seven times the amount of money that my father spent they have no
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:18.520]  message so what do they try and do they try and obstruct a great man they try
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:21.560]  and obstruct his family they come after us
[1:35:21.560 --> 1:35:26.520]  viciously eric i got it i got a face really horrible
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:30.600]  so there you go sean hannity last night were the only good decent tv shows
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:33.640]  left there to basically break down what's happening in the news
[1:35:33.640 --> 1:35:37.800]  we see the ongoing take down of fox news and then it's going to be the rest of
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:43.240]  the alternative media and they admit that they want to
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:47.160]  shut us all down like they're doing in europe but there's got to be
[1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:49.960]  some end to the level that people will put up with
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:52.600]  just like i read earlier and i want to open the phones up and take your calls
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:55.640]  with michael schneider just like i read the headline
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:59.480]  earlier swedish government orders clinic to end
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:03.960]  treatment for rape victims in favor of treating migrants
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:07.240]  the swedish government has announced that a clinic in stockholm
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:10.840]  will no longer treat female rape victims and the money will be spent
[1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:15.000]  on treating traumatized muslim migrants instead
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:18.040]  yesterday i reported how they're telling the women go out and have sex with the
[1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:21.320]  migrants to make them feel welcome
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:25.720]  after 10 years of helping rape victims the stockholm crisis and trauma center
[1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:30.520]  will now only devote itself to patients with war and torture trauma
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:35.880]  these are mainly the soldiers of isis now as refugees 80 percent
[1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:41.800]  military's men coming in and getting the treatment authorities in stockholm
[1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:45.320]  notice it's stockholm sweden stockholm syndrome where you
[1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:49.240]  worship your abusers and serve them authorities in stockholm
[1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:52.200]  claim their agreement but the clinic does not cover rape victims
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:55.880]  and the focus will now be moved to treating migrants because all the new
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:59.320]  welfare money isn't for the swedes anymore
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:03.160]  it's all for the islamist psychological problems are associated with
[1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:06.680]  tortures severe trauma from war despite the fact that the majority of them
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:10.520]  migrants pouring into sweden are not arriving from war-torn countries
[1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:15.240]  according to maria hagerstein unit manager of psychiatry in stockholms
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:20.120]  county council this is a group that is now expanding
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:23.720]  with the major migration flows that exist and we want them to be able
[1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:28.040]  to help even more of that group in the future
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:31.240]  the clinic helps around 200 rape victims annually
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:35.400]  with around 140 of these being women all of them will now have to find somewhere
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:39.880]  else to receive support and it's like this every day it's a total
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:43.960]  pattern tommy morrison shot video last week we aired it here
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:52.200]  there's new video today or robinson tommy robinson teleprompter free folks
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:58.520]  and it shows this really fancy house
[1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:04.440]  and it's got surveillance and a cop car out front it and each of the thousands
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:08.680]  that admit they're with isis and want to tear they're allowed to stay
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:12.200]  even though they're not british citizens they're allowed to just sit there
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:15.320]  wear nightgowns and walk around with their giant beards and do nothing all day
[1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:19.320]  and lecture everyone arrogantly the total mental illness
[1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:22.600]  and then he's right next door
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:27.320]  to an elementary school his back fence backs up to it
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:30.360]  and i've got articles here just people getting stabbed
[1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:33.160]  all over the place
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:37.960]  and then you've got the leftist saying that if the socialist doesn't win and
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:41.720]  defeat may in england in the uk this weekend
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:46.360]  supporters threaten violence if labor doesn't win the election
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:49.320]  so i want to go over all this michael schneider and take your phone calls and
[1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:52.520]  hit other issues that are on his front burner the toll free number to join us
[1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:57.560]  is eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:00.840]  nine nine two three one on any of these specific issues
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:04.680]  the open coup to overthrow trump number six months ago i told you about that
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:06.680]  that sounded kind of far-fetched now it's here
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:11.080]  these people mean business this is a struggle to regain the country in the
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:13.080]  world we're fighting hard this is real
[1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:17.160]  you're in the middle of history they're openly trying to destroy our first
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:19.080]  amendment they're openly trying to take over the
[1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:23.400]  internet freedom it's all happening but the good news is if we just keep
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:28.200]  speaking out and keep saying no keep realizing
[1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:34.120]  that big national special reports and memes being pushed a lot of stuff in
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:37.720]  mainstream news is true gotta learn how to vet it go through but when there's
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:41.160]  big official stories like there's no wiretapping of the white house
[1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:45.320]  and then they admit they were or there's those things is islamic terror remember
[1:39:45.320 --> 1:39:49.720]  that don't use that term see how fast that narrative collapsed but for eight
[1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:54.520]  years obama said that and the media followed his orders
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:40:00.280]  so just call this baloney this garbage this bs for what it is just say no to
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:03.720]  the peer pressure because all you have to lose
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:07.720]  is being a slave you go along with this it's over and i know most of you know

[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:55.080]  where is this entire islamist this thing going
[1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:58.120]  do you think people are really starting to get fed up with it i mean we're seeing
[1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:00.440]  that and and and where does it go i mean it's the
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:05.080]  desperation of the globalist and the left a sign that they're about to collapse
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:08.280]  or they just get more frantic and more frantic and more frantic and through
[1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:12.520]  mass Stockholm syndrome everybody just submits to the little
[1:43:12.520 --> 1:43:17.480]  toddlers throwing fits yeah well on the left you see they're so politically
[1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:21.880]  correct they're paralyzed they don't even understand that radical islam has
[1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:25.320]  declared war on us they are worldview they want to
[1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:30.280]  destroy us they're they're their intent is world domination but you never see the
[1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:33.080]  left criticizing them but wait what you alex
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:37.240]  we're seeing terror attacks 2015 all-time record hyper islamic terror
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:39.960]  attacks then 2016 we shattered that record we're on
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:43.880]  pace to shatter that record again where we're seeing it is the day after day
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:47.240]  you know they're coming in so fast now we can barely keep up with all the islamic
[1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:49.880]  terror attacks all over the world you look at sweden
[1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:53.800]  i had ancestors actually came from sweden settled in minnesota
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:57.080]  so i have roots going back to sweden at one time
[1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:01.320]  sweden had one of the lowest crime rates on the entire planet very peaceful just
[1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:04.920]  the lovely country but now that's been totally turned upside down not
[1:44:04.920 --> 1:44:08.360]  because of the indigenous population that's been
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:12.040]  there for centuries but it's because it's all because of
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:15.480]  the refugees that have been brought in the islamic
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:18.040]  immigration and there's some cities in sweden now
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:21.960]  you simply do not want to go to because they're so dangerous
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:25.480]  but it but but and yet still they're so paralyzed by their
[1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:29.160]  political correctness they're not doing anything about it and that's why when
[1:44:29.160 --> 1:44:32.440]  donald trump he wants to he's calling it a travel ban but
[1:44:32.440 --> 1:44:35.960]  you know we want to know who's coming in we don't want to bring in
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:39.880]  enemy soldiers and that's what they are into this country that are intent on
[1:44:39.880 --> 1:44:44.120]  destroying us and and and conquering us is what they
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:47.160]  intend to do donald trump is correct to say hey
[1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:50.040]  we want to know who these people are we don't want people coming in who want to
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:54.440]  make war with us and yet who's blocking him it's the court system like i
[1:44:54.440 --> 1:44:59.400]  said earlier how the court system is dominated by the left by radical
[1:44:59.400 --> 1:45:02.440]  liberals and they're saying no you can't have this travel ban no you can't do
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:05.640]  this trump and so that you know we've not only
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:09.320]  got to take the presidency we've got to literally have a cultural
[1:45:09.320 --> 1:45:14.280]  revolution where we take every institution in our society
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:18.200]  all the governing institutions all the educational institutions
[1:45:18.200 --> 1:45:22.120]  and that's why we're building our army through the info war we're in a war for
[1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:25.720]  hearts and minds one at a time and once upon a time alex
[1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:29.560]  jones started very small once upon a time i started very very small
[1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:33.320]  but one heart and one mind at a time we've gotten to the point now we saw
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:35.320]  during the break where hillary clinton knows
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:39.080]  who alex jones is by name she's very clear that you're one of her top
[1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:42.520]  enemies because you're having such an impact so we're fighting the info war
[1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:44.920]  we're building our army but then the next stage
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:50.120]  is to literally take over the structures and institutions in society we have to
[1:45:50.120 --> 1:45:55.320]  we have to we don't want to just like the founding fathers but if we don't
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:59.080]  we are complicit in our own family's destruction i mean this is so
[1:45:59.080 --> 1:46:04.040]  obvious to see oh it is and there's no guarantee of success people often
[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:07.560]  ask me well michael can we do it can we defeat the new world order can we
[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:11.160]  you know actually win well with the first the
[1:46:11.160 --> 1:46:15.800]  revolutionary war who would have ever imagined that a ragtag group of rebels
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:19.800]  could actually defeat the great british empire the greatest empire on the
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:23.320]  entire planet who would have thought that could have happened but it did
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:26.760]  because they were sold out they were passionate they were determined they
[1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:30.280]  were willing to give their lives and they gave everything for the cause of
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:34.120]  liberty and freedom now today alex my wife and i
[1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:37.080]  about six years ago we moved up here to northern idaho
[1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:39.880]  because we wanted to find one of the reasons we did that we want to find
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:43.720]  somewhere where people could still live free because in most of america that's
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:45.880]  not the case but we wanted to find one of these
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:50.040]  little enclaves where there was still some liberty and some freedom and now
[1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:53.560]  they're shipping in weaponized muslims to every small town in idaho and every
[1:46:53.560 --> 1:46:58.120]  other small man it is like incredible and how obvious it is
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:01.720]  oh it's true and they specifically target the small towns alex under the
[1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:04.920]  obama administration they were specifically targeting conservative
[1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:08.520]  small towns he set up the rural affairs group and they said
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:11.560]  he they said the countryside is too white
[1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:14.120]  and it's too conservative well forget the white thing they mean it's too
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:17.000]  christian too conservative enclaves of americana
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:21.480]  so they said we're going to ship un vetted muslims in mass
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:24.920]  into those areas put them on welfare and then use them as the new
[1:47:24.920 --> 1:47:28.760]  culture conflict group then they'll ship in a foreign kingpin
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:32.600]  who owns them and runs them and will have local factories they use
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:35.560]  then they get control of your sheriff then they get control of your courts and
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:39.800]  then it's game over they're bringing in foreign islamic boss
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:43.720]  hogs from dearborn michigan to you name it to run us
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:47.800]  yeah and now here in idaho we've got rapes and sexual assaults
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:52.280]  by islamic immigrants here in idaho you know and so that i mean the
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:56.920]  federal government reaches everywhere if you build a if you try to expand your
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:47:59.880]  pond well you can get big trouble with the federal
[1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:02.920]  government they can find you millions and millions of dollars that we've seen
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:06.840]  in california there was a case where a farmer plowed his own field to grow
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:09.480]  crops he got fined millions of millions of dollars by the
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:12.280]  federal government there's nowhere that's out of the
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:15.000]  reach of this monster this federal government
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:19.800]  which is you know the left loves big government for every problem the solution
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:23.320]  is more government but every time government grows
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:28.040]  our freedom and liberty diminish so you know if we're supposed to our founding
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:31.080]  fathers wanted to establish a nation where freedom and liberty were
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:35.720]  maximized but big government is the enemy of that every new law
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:40.040]  and alex on the on the federal level there's hundreds of thousands of
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:43.800]  statutes rules and regulations but when you throw in the state and local
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:47.720]  levels all across this country it goes in the millions we've got millions of
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:52.040]  laws governing this country and every new law every new government agency
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:55.560]  every time government grows freedom and liberty shrink
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:49:00.120]  and we're losing it we're losing our way and our listeners know that
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:03.320]  but people don't understand it's a means to an end they want
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:07.880]  control and the useful idiots that serve this they're just domesticated and dumb
[1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:10.760]  down and think the only way they get a better job or a better lifestyle is
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:13.720]  bigger government we have to somehow reach out to those people
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:17.320]  and let them know this is a trap i want to go to carlos i want to go to christin
[1:49:17.320 --> 1:49:21.000]  i want to go to jeff i want to go to

[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:49.000]  women in in switzerland they're not going to be able to get treated for being
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.640]  raped sweden and actually in stock home that's
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:55.720]  where they say yes you're being raped go and give yourself to the muslims
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:49:58.840]  that is the loving thing to do that was yesterday's news that's that's in their
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:01.480]  news that's why they call it stock home syndrome
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:04.440]  where they found in sweden you know and it's other areas of the world
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:08.040]  historically people get into being abused
[1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:12.520]  wow the other thing that i wanted to the major thing that i wanted to talk to
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:16.920]  you about or ask about i see two scenarios for the united states

[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:26.200]  next thing that i see and i i hope i don't want it to happen but i would
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:30.520]  rather that happen than the civil war would be a soviet style collapse of the
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:34.200]  united states i think it needs to come down
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:37.480]  well you said it we're in the middle of a political civil war to retake the
[1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:39.960]  country the globalists are trying to destroy everything
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:42.520]  trying to wreck the nation openly they admit they're trying to kill the stock

[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:27.480]  bringing in muslims meghan kelly asked me what's this
[1:54:27.480 --> 1:54:30.360]  about you blaming the little kids got blown up
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:34.360]  no i know i blamed the trendies that open the borders up and bring people in
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:37.960]  i don't blame the kids obviously but how do you turn it around when the left
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:41.880]  says bring in the muslims then it kills a bunch of people that
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:46.600]  this ideology blame the people that tried to stop it how smart
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:50.360]  that's what they've got to do though always change the subject like your
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:52.920]  weak minded we're going to go to christian and
[1:54:52.920 --> 1:54:56.280]  jeff and ian and others here in just a second

[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:02.200]  author
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:06.440]  we're in a civil war i mean history is happening it's so big now
[1:55:06.440 --> 1:55:09.480]  that i've always known we were fighting this and i want to fight it it's so real
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:13.160]  now that i'm more dedicated than ever but
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:19.240]  it's like nothing is fun anymore it's just it's like total war i don't care
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:21.960]  about being around celebrities i don't even care about money all i care about
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:24.520]  my kids and i never really care about the stuff but now
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:28.280]  it makes me sick watching everybody fawn over
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:32.600]  meghan kelly it makes me nothing against nothing even against her i just
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:37.080]  people i don't know how to explain it's just all that matters is our freedom and
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:40.120]  it's under attack and we're fighting such evil people
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:43.240]  need to break the trance
[1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:48.920]  eyes the left is relentless they're never going to give up they're never
[1:55:48.920 --> 1:55:52.760]  they're not going to give any quarter we're in an all out war now the last
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:57.000]  color talked about a civil war and he taught you but we we do not
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:02.040]  ever want it to get violent because violence is not our message our message
[1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:05.720]  we've got a so far superior message than anything the left could ever have
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:08.760]  you know we've got the constitution we've got the values and principles this
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:12.280]  country has founded upon and they work and they once made america the greatest
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:15.640]  place on the entire planet and they can do it again but the left has shown
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:19.000]  they're willing to increasingly become violent in recent years we've seen
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:23.160]  street protests get more and more violent then kathy griffin just did us one of
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:27.240]  the greatest favors that anybody has done in a very very long time when she
[1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:31.080]  held up that head of donald trump because it shows what's in their heart is
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:34.760]  what they want that they are they're violent at heart that they're
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:38.680]  destructive at heart that ultimately what they want is the complete
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.160]  eradication of our way of life and so that image of kathy griffin is
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:47.000]  going to be burned into the minds of people all across this country and when
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:50.520]  they see the violence in the streets by the left when they see what kathy
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:53.000]  griffin has done and other things the left is doing
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:56.200]  they're going to say hey we're disgusted by this
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:59.720]  and and they're going to listen to our message which is a message of hope
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:04.440]  of love of a bright future of restoring america of making us the greatest
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:08.840]  nation on a free enterprise of capitalism of an increasing wealth in
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:14.120]  society of liberty and freedom of people pursuing uh the life and liberty
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:17.080]  and the pursuit of happiness everything our founders wanted
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:20.600]  that's a positive message and that's going to win over holding up a bloody
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:25.800]  head of donald trump and the thing is
[1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:29.000]  how could anybody claim their anti-establishment when the republican
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:32.920]  establishment the foreign governments the eu the corrupt pope
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:39.160]  the communist chinese hollywood the you know the democrats all want to destroy
[1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:42.920]  him and then he's delivering prosperity he's not letting multinational screw
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:45.480]  over people he's building factories and minority
[1:57:45.480 --> 1:57:48.600]  areas everywhere and it just gives me chills
[1:57:48.600 --> 1:57:51.960]  that how much they hate him and it isn't about worshiping trump i can't
[1:57:51.960 --> 1:57:55.400]  believe it it's like that british member of parliament said
[1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:58.680]  he's going to go down as the only roundly criticized politician who got in
[1:57:58.680 --> 1:58:03.080]  trouble for keeping his campaign promises
[1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:07.160]  yeah that that we've never seen hatred i don't think for any politician at the
[1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:09.400]  level that we see hatred for donald trump
[1:58:09.400 --> 1:58:13.560]  because and and i don't know if even donald trump fully understands but he
[1:58:13.560 --> 1:58:16.280]  he has come to represent everything that
[1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:19.880]  therefore their progressive agenda the progressive agenda not only in this
[1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:23.960]  country but the global progressive agenda which is dominating the western
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:26.840]  world the new world order and i don't even know
[1:58:26.840 --> 1:58:30.440]  to what extent donald trump understands he's not literally just fighting the
[1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:33.320]  democrats not literally just fighting the republican
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:37.800]  establishment but literally fighting the new world order that's right stay there
[1:58:37.800 --> 1:58:40.760]  we're gonna come right back in 70 seconds and go right to christian thank
[1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:43.960]  you for listening and right to jazz we just came back from paris
[1:58:43.960 --> 1:58:47.800]  oh man well our crew has been there it is hellish now beautiful paris is a
[1:58:47.800 --> 1:58:50.200]  crap hole
[1:58:50.840 --> 1:58:54.440]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry
[1:58:54.440 --> 1:58:59.160]  our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a
[1:58:59.160 --> 1:59:02.280]  chance to organize and prepare a defense
[1:59:02.280 --> 1:59:05.720]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[1:59:05.720 --> 1:59:09.560]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own
[1:59:09.560 --> 1:59:15.320]  air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:20.120]  pathogens added to the food and water to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[1:59:20.120 --> 1:59:25.080]  vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death
[1:59:25.080 --> 1:59:28.520]  i personally counter this onslaught with antroplex
[1:59:28.520 --> 1:59:34.760]  antroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the
[1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:38.600]  basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[1:59:38.600 --> 1:59:42.520]  inside the human body discover why anthroplex has turned so many heads today
[1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:46.360]  it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at
[1:59:46.360 --> 1:59:50.680]  infowarslife.com with anthroplex
[1:59:51.880 --> 1:59:56.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:10.280]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god
[2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:16.600]  it's alex jones
[2:00:28.920 --> 2:00:33.800]  you know i just hate the polished professionalism of the globalist
[2:00:33.800 --> 2:00:37.880]  and their cold-bloodedness as they track whatever the best courses for their
[2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:43.560]  own personal power the expense of humanity
[2:00:43.560 --> 2:00:46.520]  i said some pretty mean things about meghan kelly and that she's like
[2:00:46.520 --> 2:00:52.600]  gonna be nice voicemails and stuff but it wasn't nice during the interview
[2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:56.040]  and i'm not even afraid of that i just it's weird how they want to say that
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:00:59.400]  they're not being mean when they are it's like this mind game
[2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:03.400]  and not pretending like msm has this agenda and not pretending like they're
[2:01:03.400 --> 2:01:07.800]  following an exact script to destroy me so they can have this example to
[2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:12.600]  others to say you better not stand up or we'll crush you
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:16.280]  i'm not afraid of them trying to destroy me i'm not
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:20.280]  i am afraid of them intimidating you because the globalists don't have the
[2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:23.640]  power they're losing the power they're panicking
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:26.440]  and they've gotten desperate they're trying to bully us in the submission and
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:29.160]  there's one thing in my life i hadn't liked is bullies
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:33.640]  and i'm sick of them michael steiners our guest christian in tenancy or christian
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:36.280]  and i'm gonna go to jeff christian in tenancy you're on the air thanks for
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:39.400]  holding i'm sorry christian or
[2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:43.720]  yeah christian i'm sorry third time to talk about chinese people and i'm
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:47.160]  chinese from singapore and yes we work all the time you're
[2:01:47.160 --> 2:01:50.920]  correct but i've been begging to be an anchor on your
[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:54.440]  show i was a model and i wrote a book called singaporean thoughts
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:58.600]  and my father was chairman of singapore stock exchange and cdl hotel chain my
[2:01:58.600 --> 2:02:01.880]  mom was an attorney for the singapore government land and title so
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:05.880]  i know the obama crash is on its way at the end of the year and
[2:02:05.880 --> 2:02:09.080]  i want to make sure everyone knows it's not going to be trump's fault
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:12.600]  well ma'am send us a resume at jobs and info wars we barely have the crew to
[2:02:12.600 --> 2:02:16.040]  look to look at the resumes we're at that kind of building point it's so hard
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:19.880]  to get through uh but jobs info wars dot com absolutely
[2:02:19.880 --> 2:02:23.320]  tell us about obama crash because the globalists were implementing a global
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:26.840]  financial meltdown they admitted that that's come out trump's trying to block
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:32.040]  that ron paul agrees very valiantly what do you think the obama crash is
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:36.840]  okay the three reasons why in my book singaporean thoughts what why there is
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:41.960]  going to be an obama crash is number one 94 million unemployed
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:46.760]  because and uh 44 million illegals which you know they say it's 11 million but
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:52.360]  it's actually 44 second reason is because of the cyclical
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:55.960]  which was supposed to crash every seven years so the second reason
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:02:59.720]  is it was supposed to crash in 2015 and obama manipulated it
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:03.800]  and the third reason is the fad which is of course we know
[2:03:03.800 --> 2:03:08.520]  owned by the ross childs and um they have already raised the interest rate once
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:11.320]  on trump so they're going to burst the interest rate bubble
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:14.840]  by raising it twice more they only raised in obama
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:19.080]  eight times two times in eight years and they're going to raise it three times
[2:03:19.080 --> 2:03:23.480]  on trump in one year so that bubble will burst once that burst it's going to be
[2:03:23.480 --> 2:03:27.480]  a crash and california will be the most affected i used to live in cal
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:30.760]  for all the libertard states i lived in california i was a model and
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:33.720]  actress i did the movie for the for all of her stone which
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:37.880]  who turned out to be great actually because on his facebook page she has a
[2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:41.320]  whole whole thing with links on the russian hoax
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:45.400]  which supports trump and then no no all of her stones are real liberal i mean
[2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:47.960]  he's got liberal policies i don't agree with but he's a real guy
[2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:51.160]  who stands up for the truth over and over again uh when it's politically
[2:03:51.160 --> 2:03:54.360]  incorrect but michael snider you've got the you know the news site
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:58.120]  economic collapse blog uh i think a lot of what she's saying makes sense what
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:00.520]  do you think oh definitely especially about the
[2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:03.560]  federal reserve because a stock market crash i believe
[2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:07.080]  is coming but it's not going to be donald trump's fault for example in the
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:09.960]  second half of this year of the stock market crashes all the fingers are going
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:12.360]  to be pointed at trump but we need to educate people
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:15.880]  that the federal reserve has far far more power over the economy and our
[2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:19.960]  financial system than presidents than congress and anyone else
[2:04:19.960 --> 2:04:23.160]  and during the obama years the federal reserve's pushed interest rates all the
[2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:27.640]  way to the floor as low as they could go and then they injected
[2:04:27.640 --> 2:04:31.720]  just trillions of hot dollars into this system through their quantitative
[2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:35.080]  easing programs unprecedented intervention
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:38.680]  into the financial right and like we've never seen before created this giant
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:42.360]  bubble stock market going to all-time highs and but throughout
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:45.560]  since 1913 there have been 18 distinct recessions or depressions
[2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:49.320]  hold on steiner finish up on the other side the federal reserve
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:52.520]  he can't hear me because this guy cuts over it uh
[2:04:52.520 --> 2:04:55.080]  kirsten thank you we're gonna be right back with michael snider we'll have him
[2:04:55.080 --> 2:04:58.040]  finish and we have the next guest
[2:04:59.320 --> 2:05:01.960]  we have two major problems in this country when it comes to spending one is
[2:05:01.960 --> 2:05:04.920]  the warfare state and the other is the welfare state 13 alabama
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:07.720]  counties saw 85 drop in food stamp participation
[2:05:07.720 --> 2:05:11.320]  after work requirements reinstated go figure so during the economic downturn
[2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:14.440]  between 2011 and 2013 several states including alabama
[2:05:14.440 --> 2:05:17.480]  waived these snap work requirements in response to high unemployment alabama
[2:05:17.480 --> 2:05:21.320]  reinstated the work requirements for 54 counties on january 1st 2016 and then
[2:05:21.320 --> 2:05:25.480]  for the remaining 13 on january 1st 2017 among those 13 counties that were
[2:05:25.480 --> 2:05:28.840]  5538 adults ages 18 to 50 without the penance
[2:05:28.840 --> 2:05:31.800]  receiving food stamps by may 1st of this year that number had dropped to
[2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:35.960]  831 a decline of 85 percent now remember snap is essentially an
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:38.440]  electronic soup line so we don't see people waiting in long
[2:05:38.440 --> 2:05:41.080]  lines to get food in soup kitchens they get them on a debit card which is
[2:05:41.080 --> 2:05:43.320]  another way the government gets to control you the trump administration
[2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:46.360]  has vowed to cut food stamp rolls over the next decade ensuring that able-bodied
[2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:49.080]  adult recipients are working and democrats were up in arms about this
[2:05:49.080 --> 2:05:51.640]  but if you look at alabama you can see that it really does work
[2:05:51.640 --> 2:05:54.200]  i'm all for helping people out if they need a hand but i work and there's no
[2:05:54.200 --> 2:05:56.440]  reason why other able-bodied people can't get out there and do the same

[2:08:31.800 --> 2:08:33.960]  we're about to finish up with michael schneider
[2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:37.160]  on the obama crash or the globalist plan to implode the economy
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:40.760]  a lot of the factors that are coming together right now
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:44.760]  they're trying to plunge the stock market in the news and the democrats are
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:49.720]  saying it's a good thing to stop trump when it's the trump
[2:08:49.720 --> 2:08:54.280]  exuberance and the election and the policies that have got the stock market
[2:08:54.280 --> 2:08:57.880]  and the economy going from a stall to a partial
[2:08:57.880 --> 2:09:01.800]  reignition but they don't care they'd rather wreck the whole country
[2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:06.840]  have full control it's not just stop trump but stop a populist movement
[2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:11.240]  we're going to be talking to a gentleman who's running against pocahontas
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:16.920]  in the senate we have dr shiva iadore joining us coming up here just a few
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:20.840]  minutes but first off let's go to michael schneider to
[2:09:20.840 --> 2:09:25.000]  finish up with the historical breakdown you got interrupted by the break
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:28.680]  kind of roll through the economic climate the two
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:34.920]  countervailing forces of nationalism trumpism coming in but is it too little
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:38.840]  too late to stop the global economic meltdown
[2:09:38.840 --> 2:09:42.040]  well donald trump can't keep the federal reserve from raising rates if they
[2:09:42.040 --> 2:09:44.920]  want to raise rates they know that's going to slow the economy down they
[2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:47.880]  know that's going to hurt the financial markets but they might want to do that to
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:51.000]  hurt trump now these booms and busts keep getting worse for
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:54.200]  example 2008 that crisis was worse than when the dot
[2:09:54.200 --> 2:09:57.080]  com bubble burst and this next one is looking like it's going to be a lot
[2:09:57.080 --> 2:10:00.120]  worse than 2008 and so what we need to do this time
[2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:03.800]  around we need to say hey we've got to stop this madness we need to
[2:10:03.800 --> 2:10:07.000]  tell the american people no matter who is president this is going to keep
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.120]  happening till we get rid of the federal reserve so i'm going to make it my
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:12.360]  mission and i'm calling on people all over the country
[2:10:12.360 --> 2:10:15.720]  we need to not only just restart the end the fed movement but we need to
[2:10:15.720 --> 2:10:19.640]  abolish the federal reserve do whatever we can and that's one of the reasons
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:22.360]  why i'm thinking of running for public office we need to do it all over the
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:25.800]  country we need to get rid of the debt based federal reserve their
[2:10:25.800 --> 2:10:29.000]  debt based currency go to a new system because if we don't
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.440]  this is going to keep happening over and over again no matter which political
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:37.240]  parties in control but will they be successful
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:43.480]  looking at all the different forces to stop the trump recovery
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:48.920]  well we'll see you know i think that uh you know that they're really targeting
[2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:53.480]  the in the second half this year and beyond for you know the economy turns
[2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:56.200]  down that can turn a lot of people against trump i think that's what i
[2:10:56.200 --> 2:10:59.640]  think democrats are secretly hoping that that's going to happen
[2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:03.480]  so that they turn hearts and minds against trump and so that i mean they're
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:06.760]  really targeting the 2018 midterm elections
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:10.760]  really hard the democrats are right now
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:15.080]  what else is on the economic horizon well alex we're seeing a lot of
[2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:19.000]  troubling signs for example right now in the auto industry we're seeing sales
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:23.320]  are way down and a lot of that for the auto industry we're already
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:26.280]  essentially in a recession in terms of the retail
[2:11:26.280 --> 2:11:32.040]  uh it's a retail apocalypse where we're on pace for more stores to close
[2:11:32.040 --> 2:11:35.480]  this year than ever before in america here isn't that amazon
[2:11:35.480 --> 2:11:39.720]  is it that amazon doing the walmart what walmart did to small towns
[2:11:39.720 --> 2:11:43.080]  well that's a big part of the internet coming in and destroying things
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:47.240]  but alex even beyond that i mean we're going to shatter the all-time record by
[2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:51.560]  20 in terms of most store closings and so we're
[2:11:51.560 --> 2:11:55.400]  starting to see all these factors come together we're starting to see
[2:11:55.400 --> 2:11:59.640]  commercial and industrial loans slow down credit is tightening up and that
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:02.440]  happens in the early phase of an economic slowdown
[2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:05.720]  where because everything in our society is dead in credit and when credit
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:08.760]  starts to tighten up that slows down economic activity
[2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:12.600]  same thing that happened in 2008 so all these signs that you would expect to
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:15.160]  see in the right before a recession or in the
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:18.280]  early parts of a recession are happening right now
[2:12:18.280 --> 2:12:21.800]  and and has been so long since you know 2008 so
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:24.920]  you know we've had a long time but even with you know
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:29.560]  this so-called recovery alex if you go back and you average economic growth in
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:33.480]  last 10 years i went back and did this with a calculator over the last 10 years
[2:12:33.480 --> 2:12:38.280]  we've had average economic growth in this country of 1.33 percent
[2:12:38.280 --> 2:12:43.000]  so then i went back into the 1930s and average those 10 years in the 1930s
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:48.600]  and i averaged the economic growth during the 1930s the depression comes to 1.33
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:52.600]  percent exactly equal so our average economic
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:55.640]  growth over the last 10 years is exactly equal to during the great
[2:12:55.640 --> 2:13:00.040]  depression of the 1930s and now it looks like things are slowing down again
[2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:03.560]  and donald trump he's been able to do some things through executive orders
[2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:07.240]  but most of the biggest things whether it's reducing taxes whether it's
[2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:10.440]  you know getting rid of government agencies getting rid of red tape
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:14.840]  he needs congress to do that and the establishment republicans
[2:13:14.840 --> 2:13:18.520]  and congress are blocking him so we got to do something about those established
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:21.720]  republicans that's right we ever want the full trump agenda
[2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:25.640]  to move forward that's right we got to expand that freedom caucus thank you so
[2:13:25.640 --> 2:13:29.800]  much michael steiner thank you alex now we've got our
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:32.760]  next case whether it's still about 40 after so that i'm going to continue with
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:38.520]  your phone calls uh jeff and ian and john and carlos and jason
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:42.600]  who's calling from germany we'll also talk about the big testimony from
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:46.280]  comey uh telling us about the ghost of you know
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:49.960]  russian collusion uh but i love the fact that we were just
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:53.400]  talking about running for the local office running for the national office
[2:13:53.400 --> 2:13:56.680]  even if you don't win and this climate a lot of folks are
[2:13:56.680 --> 2:14:01.160]  against incumbents you're educating people in the town halls the debates
[2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:05.080]  the local radio this is where you can get so much free publicity
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:09.240]  to promote americana and renaissance and basic freedom ideas
[2:14:09.240 --> 2:14:13.640]  now i would interview uh dr shiva here uh
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:17.480]  just just to pick his brain how interesting his life is
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:21.880]  with all of his uh four degrees from mit and all of his work it's all the
[2:14:21.880 --> 2:14:25.320]  things he's invented uh but now it's really exciting to see that he's
[2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:30.680]  running uh against a particular senator uh who is
[2:14:30.680 --> 2:14:34.200]  really pushing the globalist agenda so uh you i'm aware of this kind i'm a
[2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:36.840]  fan but you're an even bigger fan but i'm aware of him longer so why don't you
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:40.680]  introduce our next uh guest hero and stroyer well it's been great
[2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:44.440]  talked into dr shiva because it's just like the same way when i'm talking to
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:47.800]  oman avar i feel like i'm talking to a regular guy somebody that i could go
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:51.080]  out sit down enjoy lunch with enjoy a beverage with
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:53.880]  and not somebody that wants to try to screw me or screw this country so
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:58.280]  that's just refreshing to begin with but alex what shiva is doing right now and
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:00.360]  i'm glad to have him on to talk about this
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:04.120]  is he's putting out an ultimatum to elizabeth warren to put her money
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:08.200]  where her mouth is when it comes to the monsanto protection act
[2:15:08.200 --> 2:15:14.280]  and gmo's now doctor you actually have some statistics here showing that gmo's
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:19.000]  and how they affect the formaldehyde implants and the glutothione implants
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:22.440]  and you're willing to put your money where the mouth is you're offering
[2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:27.080]  elizabeth warren your lab your car say do these tests make them public have you
[2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:31.000]  gotten a response from her yet no we haven't i mean uh
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:34.200]  first of all thanks alan and oan for having me on here you know i want to
[2:15:34.200 --> 2:15:38.120]  use this opportunity actually live on your show to challenge elizabeth warren
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:41.880]  you know i did uh using the technology that i created at mit we
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:46.120]  essentially showed that gmo soy for example has
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:50.360]  nearly 300 less glutothione and it up regulates formaldehyde we publish these
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:54.280]  in a series of five papers it was in fact validated by independent
[2:15:54.280 --> 2:15:58.200]  experiments that were done in leeds in london but the bottom line is when you
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:02.680]  look at elizabeth warren uh not only she a fake indian but she's also a fake
[2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:06.520]  fighter you know she has uh supported the monsanto
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:09.320]  protection act she voted for this and this act
[2:16:09.320 --> 2:16:15.560]  basically uh ensures that the department of agriculture
[2:16:15.560 --> 2:16:18.680]  can intercede with an injunction by the courts
[2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:22.200]  to stop genetically engineered foods so for example if it was discovered the
[2:16:22.200 --> 2:16:26.120]  genetically engineered foods are in fact harmful to human health or through
[2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:29.800]  or through environmental health the courts can stop that but the department
[2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:33.000]  of agriculture uh through this monsanto protection
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:36.520]  act bill which was snuck in into an appropriations bill at the last
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:39.960]  minute allows the department of agriculture to
[2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:42.920]  intercede and stop that but fundamentally when you look at it
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:46.360]  when you look at the all the research which is what we did and we connected
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:49.320]  that that together using this technology we found out
[2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:52.840]  that genetically engineered soy by the way 97 of the soy in the united states
[2:16:52.840 --> 2:16:58.440]  is genetically engineered is uh has less glutothione nearly 300
[2:16:58.440 --> 2:17:01.480]  percent which is extremely important for protecting the plant and thereby
[2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:05.400]  up regulates formaldehyde you know when we publish this we were attacked
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:09.640]  by a professor at the university of florida who's since been exposed
[2:17:09.640 --> 2:17:13.720]  for being in collusion with monsanto a guy called kevin folta
[2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:17.320]  but more importantly what we've shown is that when you look at the academic
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:20.760]  elites they like to use science fake science to
[2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:23.640]  create narratives the problem they have with me is
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:27.320]  i have four degrees from MIT including my phd in biological engineering
[2:17:27.320 --> 2:17:31.080]  and because i've been successful because of america because of the
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:34.520]  uh journey i went through i can actually challenge these people so the
[2:17:34.520 --> 2:17:37.720]  official challenge is i will give my 10 million dollar building in
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:41.560]  cambridge including the campaign bus we're using and i'll in fact throw in
[2:17:41.560 --> 2:17:45.480]  my 1994 beautiful corvette to elizabeth warn if she can
[2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:49.480]  disprove that gmo's uh have any safety assessment
[2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:53.800]  standards the realities there are no safety assessment standards for gmo's
[2:17:53.800 --> 2:17:57.880]  and all the act predominantly most of the academics in biology do not even
[2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:02.680]  address this question it's paid to play science right now and um
[2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:06.520]  that's what's going on dr shiva i do array you i've heard of you read about
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:09.320]  you some before and and you actually hold some of the
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:12.760]  original patents on email and when you were 14 years old you were
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:16.520]  recruited by the university of medicine and industry
[2:18:16.520 --> 2:18:20.200]  in new jersey as a research fellow and then it goes right through all your
[2:18:20.200 --> 2:18:24.200]  you know amazing work your chairman and ceo of uh
[2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:28.040]  cytosolve ink and a bunch of other companies and it's a shiva for senate
[2:18:28.040 --> 2:18:31.080]  dot com but but very very exciting to see
[2:18:31.080 --> 2:18:35.000]  you know the fact that you're weighing in here and taking action i'm not
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:38.120]  a molecular biologist i'm not a genetic engineer i'm not a
[2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:41.080]  expert on this but i know that glutathione's a key amino acid
[2:18:41.080 --> 2:18:44.760]  that's basically found in the body and then as you lose it it makes you age
[2:18:44.760 --> 2:18:48.040]  faster and i did know that glibosate's been associated
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:51.000]  with that and a lot of other stuff happening in these gmo plants how does
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:53.800]  this affect us when these plants have a lot
[2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:57.000]  less of this or is it just affecting the overall yield of the plant what's the
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:02.280]  big issue with it lowering glutathione well it's a it's a great question
[2:19:02.280 --> 2:19:05.880]  alex this is what's happening so fundamentally you know monsanto
[2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:09.240]  basically did this fake science to convince us that these
[2:19:09.240 --> 2:19:13.320]  genetically engineered plants were better for us but the realities are weaker
[2:19:13.320 --> 2:19:17.480]  so two things happen if you uh have read if you've noticed
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:22.360]  many of these gmo seeds are coated now with an insecticide called neonicotinoids
[2:19:22.360 --> 2:19:25.720]  neonicotinoids and people have always wondered why they're doing that the
[2:19:25.720 --> 2:19:29.960]  realities of plants are weaker the seeds are weaker so when they plant it
[2:19:29.960 --> 2:19:34.680]  because it has less glutathione um soil organisms can destroy that's why they
[2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:38.360]  coated with neonicotinoids well those neonicotinoids also get
[2:19:38.360 --> 2:19:42.520]  throughout the plant they affect bees in the atmosphere which affect the entire
[2:19:42.520 --> 2:19:45.160]  environment so that's one reason that that this is
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:48.680]  significantly sure and wouldn't that poison then over time affect the genetic
[2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:51.560]  expression of the plants exactly it affects the genetic
[2:19:51.560 --> 2:19:55.560]  expression of the plants but more importantly a recent paper just came
[2:19:55.560 --> 2:19:58.360]  out in nature we got a break stay right there this is riveting doctor we'll be

[2:24:26.120 --> 2:24:33.000]  for senate against the fake native american of course they thought they
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.720]  found indians they call the native americans indians but he's actually
[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:38.920]  an indian so he's the real indian running against the imposter
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:42.440]  and he kind of used that as one of his slogans uh i want to continue getting
[2:24:42.440 --> 2:24:45.800]  into what's happening with science and then after you leave us in a
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:48.760]  while you know obviously go to calls for folks that are holding
[2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:53.640]  but getting into the campaign to run against this lady
[2:24:53.640 --> 2:24:57.880]  uh let's break down her record and and what she's really up to and
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:00.680]  some of the things she's been involved in and what made you decide to go ahead
[2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:04.760]  and you know successful scientist entrepreneur to make you
[2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:08.520]  you know throw your hat in the ring well you know alex i grew up
[2:25:08.520 --> 2:25:12.200]  in uh and i was originally uh born in india and i came here
[2:25:12.200 --> 2:25:15.400]  as you may know alex india has a very oppressive caste system
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:19.240]  so my parents had this very futuristic vision and they made it out in there and
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:22.520]  they came to america because the founders of this country had a very
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:25.400]  different vision for america which was through your hard work through your
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:28.600]  bravery through your resilience you created things and that's what this
[2:25:28.600 --> 2:25:31.560]  country is about well when i look and the idea of the
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:35.240]  founders was that between us and our creator was not supposed to be monarchs
[2:25:35.240 --> 2:25:38.520]  and nobles the priesthood it was it was about us having a direct
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:41.480]  connection to our god and our creator and that's what makes this country great
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:44.760]  elizabeth warren and the self-serving elitist
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:48.200]  harvard and all these ivy league institutions and the big institutions
[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:53.000]  fundamentally believe that they know better alex and i know you know better i
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:56.280]  know we know better but that's the fundamental reason so my
[2:25:56.280 --> 2:26:00.200]  journey as an entrepreneur scientist engineer has shown me that
[2:26:00.200 --> 2:26:04.280]  ultimately those people actually work for a living produce things entrepreneurs
[2:26:04.280 --> 2:26:08.600]  people like yourself who create things are the ones that make this country great
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:11.800]  people like elizabeth warren the establishment politicians of political
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:16.520]  hacks they fundamentally add zero value so i've been fortunate because of this
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:20.680]  great country alex to have you know accumulated wealth i've been able to
[2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:24.200]  get educated i could not have done that in the oppressive caste system of india
[2:26:24.200 --> 2:26:26.920]  so i believe i owe something back i love this country
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:30.680]  and elizabeth warren is what i call the not so obvious establishment you know
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:34.360]  when we look at the arc of political history we have the establishment the
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:37.640]  populist movement those people on the streets wanting a better day for
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:41.400]  themselves and their family then you have the not so obvious establishment
[2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:44.920]  which is what elizabeth warren bernie sanders these people represent
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:49.080]  they speak a good game you know as you talk about it they're very very clever
[2:26:49.080 --> 2:26:54.040]  with their pr revolution hope change but fundamentally they want to suck out
[2:26:54.040 --> 2:26:57.880]  the populist movement and drive it back to the establishment so as a student of
[2:26:57.880 --> 2:27:01.720]  systems as a student of science i fundamentally want to stop these
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:05.000]  guys and more importantly i want to drive a massive defeat
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  to warren and i know i can do this right here in massachusetts and i think
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:12.520]  the reality she's not just running for senator alex she's actually
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:16.280]  going after trump if we go to our web page it says stop donald trump
[2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:20.840]  so in in my view she's the face of what i call many ways the not so obvious
[2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:24.520]  establishment he's one of the top ring reds she's really intending to probably
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:28.200]  even run for president so uh how do we get behind you how
[2:27:28.200 --> 2:27:31.480]  do people support uh going out with this key globalist
[2:27:31.480 --> 2:27:35.400]  opposing as a leftist populist i think the number one you know we have our
[2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:39.160]  website called shiver for senate we're building this as a populist movement
[2:27:39.160 --> 2:27:42.840]  we'd love whatever donations people want to give we have volunteers that we want
[2:27:42.840 --> 2:27:46.600]  on the ground you know fundamentally in massachusetts it's a two-part election
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:51.480]  alex you have to win the primaries and the establishment republicans
[2:27:51.480 --> 2:27:55.240]  frankly make it very difficult uh so you have to get delegates so
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:59.400]  we're well on our way to doing that as you know a bunch of students and local
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:03.160]  citizens actually took an old bus and they gutted it for us and we call it
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:06.680]  real indian one and we're using that bus
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:10.280]  among people and then we're obviously using social media
[2:28:10.280 --> 2:28:14.440]  um i think but we have a uh phenomenal chance that when in curt schilling
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:18.760]  has supported our campaign uh the lowell sun a number of local newspapers
[2:28:18.760 --> 2:28:22.200]  but the reality is the more we get out there the more people hear my message
[2:28:22.200 --> 2:28:24.920]  alex uh it's it's sort of game set match for
[2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:28.280]  warren because she's gonna have a difficult time calling me a racist or
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:31.640]  white supremacist or stupid so i'm really looking forward to going head
[2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:35.000]  on head with her alex and i look forward to your guys getting the destroyer
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:39.240]  come back for a full hour soon just to cover the waterfront and the history of
[2:28:39.240 --> 2:28:42.760]  your life because it's so interesting i was already aware of some of your work
[2:28:42.760 --> 2:28:47.320]  and then when i heard a few weeks ago uh oan came here and said you know you're
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:49.400]  saying we should everybody to run for office against him
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:51.400]  you know here are some of the people i think are some of the best contenders
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:53.400]  i was like wow that's really cool that he's running
[2:28:53.400 --> 2:28:56.840]  against elizabeth warren so i'm so glad you're here sheva
[2:28:56.840 --> 2:29:02.040]  four just the number four senate dot com and again we got about a minute left
[2:29:02.040 --> 2:29:05.480]  anything else you'd like to add well i just want to say alex i think you know
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:09.640]  when you look at what's happened with the uh history of journalism as you know
[2:29:09.640 --> 2:29:12.600]  you know i invented the first email system as a 14-year-old kid
[2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:16.200]  didn't speak about it i got the first u.s copyright five years ago my mom was
[2:29:16.200 --> 2:29:19.000]  dying um she left a suitcase with all the artifacts
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:22.680]  went into the smithsonian and then gawker media attempted to
[2:29:22.680 --> 2:29:26.680]  a so-called mainstream media pro-liberal publication tried to destroy
[2:29:26.680 --> 2:29:30.360]  the facts we went after them after hulk hogan sued
[2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:33.880]  we sued we brought them down i got about a million dollar payout
[2:29:33.880 --> 2:29:36.920]  and they were forced to take down their three articles same attorney charles
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:40.120]  harder although i was aware of that i saw your name in the news
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:42.840]  i know callers are holding but just do a few more minutes with us i'm here busy
[2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:46.360]  tell that story because it's so interesting about how nasty gawker is
[2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:49.880]  we'll be back stay with us we're on the march
[2:29:49.880 --> 2:29:59.560]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:59.560 --> 2:30:02.440]  so what do you do when you're an overweight pathetic filmmaker that is
[2:30:02.440 --> 2:30:05.720]  irrelevant will you attempt to become relevant by making the president look
[2:30:05.720 --> 2:30:08.120]  bad and that's the case with michael more who has launched
[2:30:08.120 --> 2:30:12.120]  trumpy leaks a website for leftist leakers more explained to the huffington
[2:30:12.120 --> 2:30:16.120]  post that it's his patriotic duty of americans who fight against
[2:30:16.120 --> 2:30:19.880]  trump he also said donald trump thinks he's above the law
[2:30:19.880 --> 2:30:23.640]  he acts like he's above the law he stated he's above the law
[2:30:23.640 --> 2:30:27.160]  and i know this is risky i know we may get trouble
[2:30:27.160 --> 2:30:31.880]  but too much is at stake to play it safe and along with the founding fathers
[2:30:31.880 --> 2:30:36.040]  i've got your back now does anybody really believe michael more has
[2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:39.160]  anyone's back basically he's encouraging young impressionable kids who grew up
[2:30:39.160 --> 2:30:42.680]  watching his crappy documentaries into breaking the law take for instance
[2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:47.400]  sjw activist reality winner who's the latest winner in the trump leak sweepstakes
[2:30:47.400 --> 2:30:51.000]  she was added in less than an hour after leaking an innocuous nsa document
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:53.720]  would it be a shame if we all went to trumpy leaks and sent a bunch of tips
[2:30:53.720 --> 2:30:56.040]  about seith rich's murder wow do you think michael more is really
[2:30:56.040 --> 2:30:58.680]  interested in that robert reporting from fours dot com and in fours nightly
[2:30:58.680 --> 2:31:01.000]  news imbrick's essentials that's my middle name
[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:06.840]  i've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand
[2:31:06.840 --> 2:31:11.640]  that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care
[2:31:11.640 --> 2:31:14.120]  products that's organic high quality this is
[2:31:14.120 --> 2:31:17.880]  one of the top three selling organic brands

[2:32:08.200 --> 2:32:12.680]  to detoxify the body that's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal and
[2:32:12.680 --> 2:32:17.000]  chemical defense support it's made in the usa it's filled with
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:20.920]  known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[2:32:20.920 --> 2:32:24.840]  the body and it supports the info war it is a classical 360 win
[2:32:24.840 --> 2:32:28.840]  this is the formula that i personally have been taking for over a year and now
[2:32:28.840 --> 2:32:33.400]  we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[2:32:33.400 --> 2:32:37.320]  as you can possibly get you want yourself you want your family and you owe it to
[2:32:37.320 --> 2:32:41.560]  the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as

[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:56.120]  together we're changing the world now it's time to change our bodies
[2:32:56.120 --> 2:32:59.560]  with z-field info wars life dot com
[2:33:13.720 --> 2:33:18.440]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[2:33:18.440 --> 2:33:29.480]  it's alex jones
[2:33:29.480 --> 2:33:34.600]  dr ioduray is our guest or just dr sheba first name sheba for senate.com
[2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:38.120]  finishing up with your story because i know they'd had systems at some
[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:41.400]  universities and things that were similar but you codified it and put it i
[2:33:41.400 --> 2:33:43.480]  guess in a software that actually worked and you've
[2:33:43.480 --> 2:33:46.360]  you know the Smithsonian does you don't have that on display because i've read
[2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:49.400]  about the case but i'm going from memory with
[2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:54.120]  with what happened gawker obviously sued into oblivion right now
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:33:57.800]  um there it is the seven thousand dollar gawker
[2:33:57.800 --> 2:34:01.160]  settlement that could distort internet history
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:04.440]  and that's fortune saying that because there's a lot of debate about
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:07.560]  you know like five guys invented radio the same week
[2:34:07.560 --> 2:34:11.080]  but but what matters is who actually codified it i guess in the software
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:13.400]  i explain that to me and what happened with that case doctor
[2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:17.480]  yeah so alex you know in 1970 when i was a 14 year old kid you know i had
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:21.720]  finished up calculus as a kid worked hard got a chance to go to ny in a
[2:34:21.720 --> 2:34:24.440]  special sort of intensive computer science program
[2:34:24.440 --> 2:34:29.000]  and uh my because of the public school systems are great dedicated teachers
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.160]  they change the rules so i could work full time
[2:34:31.160 --> 2:34:33.880]  at the university of medicine dentistry new work what is now known as
[2:34:33.880 --> 2:34:38.040]  rutgers if you remember alex anyone over the age of 40 knows in those days
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:41.080]  the way communication took place in organizations was through the inner
[2:34:41.080 --> 2:34:45.160]  office paper based mail system you know every secretary at inbox outbox
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:48.280]  folders they had the attachments they write a
[2:34:48.280 --> 2:34:51.640]  thing called a memo with carbon paper put it in an envelope
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:34:55.320]  and send it around through these pneumatic tubes that is the system
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:34:59.080]  that that entire system alex i converted to the electronic version
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:03.400]  50 000 lines of code called an email a term never used before
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:07.240]  and in fact got the first u.s copyright at a time when copyright was the only
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:10.760]  way to protect software inventions so the facts are black and white allen
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:13.640]  i created email called the email put all the features in
[2:35:13.640 --> 2:35:16.920]  now prior to that people had the ability to exchange
[2:35:16.920 --> 2:35:21.000]  electronic messages between devices dating all the way back to the morse code
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.880]  of the 1800s i'm not claiming i'm i'm the inventor of
[2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:27.160]  electronic messaging allen but i invented email the system as we know
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:30.120]  today and those flat facts are black and white
[2:35:30.120 --> 2:35:34.200]  now i didn't talk about it five years ago my mom was dying of pulmonary
[2:35:34.200 --> 2:35:37.720]  fibrosis in a suitcase she'd left all the beautiful documents
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:41.960]  two months before she died the senior editor time magazine dug ameth
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:45.000]  went through this probably the only journalist who spent time doing this
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:48.600]  and he wrote an article called a man who invented email in november 2011
[2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:52.440]  then the smithsonian wanted it it went into the smithsonian alex and a young
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:56.280]  washington post reporter said she via adre honored as the inventor of email
[2:35:56.280 --> 2:36:00.200]  and that's when the proverbial you know chute hit the fan
[2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:05.320]  um all the old guard historians this was like a a zoa skull had been found in
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:08.520]  african reset the origin of human history allen so
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:12.680]  they went ape not because of the fact i invented email but what that meant
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:16.440]  the fact is i was on the front page of mit which is part of the military
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:19.240]  industrial complexes you know alex for inventing many other things
[2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:22.120]  but when i said email was done in newark new jersey
[2:36:22.120 --> 2:36:26.600]  by a 14 year old you know american kid outside of the bounds of the military
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:30.040]  industrial complex that changes the narrative alex that innovation can occur
[2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:33.400]  anytime anyplace by anybody you don't have to be in silicon value don't have
[2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:37.080]  to go around you remind me of your case and you won the case and it's a fact
[2:36:37.080 --> 2:36:40.200]  and just come up with the name alone is amazing but the 50 000
[2:36:40.200 --> 2:36:43.880]  lines of code and that's why the globals want a technocracy
[2:36:43.880 --> 2:36:47.720]  exactly to surveil everything they admit the nsa's main goal
[2:36:47.720 --> 2:36:51.320]  is to find these innovations snap them up and control them
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:54.440]  because they might be disruptive and it might be something they don't want the
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:57.720]  general public to have exactly alex and the fundamental
[2:36:57.720 --> 2:37:01.560]  things you know several years ago the us postal service hired me to help them
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:04.440]  out of their bankruptcy and one of the things i pointed out was you know when
[2:37:04.440 --> 2:37:08.840]  the postal service was started i it was done by our founding father so i could
[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:11.720]  send you a letter and no one could intercede in a fact
[2:37:11.720 --> 2:37:14.680]  it's a 20 year prison sentence if someone does
[2:37:14.680 --> 2:37:20.440]  what's happened with email after 93 is when google hotmail all these guys came
[2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:24.760]  in they offered quote unquote free email when it was basically waited for us to
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:28.520]  relinquish our freedom and i've argued that we have to go
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:32.200]  back to the basics of the founding fathers email in some ways
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:36.120]  should be under the purview of the postal service because at least we had laws
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:39.720]  that people if they interceded uh we had a way to adjudicate that
[2:37:39.720 --> 2:37:43.320]  as of now you know hotmail gmail they own our email
[2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:46.920]  this is a fundamental issue that people have not recognized and they admit
[2:37:46.920 --> 2:37:50.600]  they're scanning it they're reading it exactly then they would have msm just
[2:37:50.600 --> 2:37:54.040]  stands a conspiracy theory when it's a fact exactly so
[2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:57.160]  so and that's why you know last year the new york times interviewed me
[2:37:57.160 --> 2:38:00.520]  on the hillary clinton email issue i mean fundamentally
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:04.760]  what she did was deniability it's mainly the have and have nots meaning what
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:09.080]  we're entering into is a world where the haves will have all the protection
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:11.800]  private servers and the have nots like the rest of us
[2:38:11.800 --> 2:38:15.560]  will have to use gmail hotmail etc and be open to be scanning that's why the
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:18.360]  hillary clinton issue is so significant because
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:21.320]  she wanted deniability where she could have a personal
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:25.880]  email server in her home take our emails which is public emails which is the
[2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:29.800]  state department emails and own it and it's still shocking to me that she has
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:33.640]  not been prosecuted exactly she was stealing emails on a
[2:38:33.640 --> 2:38:37.480]  smaller scale than google and microsoft and all the rest of them but at least
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:40.120]  they get you to sign a contract in terms of service
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:44.040]  she was doing with classified stuff that's illegal at a whole other level
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:46.920]  and then they're busy going after donald trump in closing because you're an
[2:38:46.920 --> 2:38:49.800]  amazing guy so i'll get you back soon i'm gonna go to these calls
[2:38:49.800 --> 2:38:53.880]  dr sheba running for senate in massachusetts against elizabeth pocahontas
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:57.080]  warren looking at this
[2:38:57.080 --> 2:39:00.920]  what do you make of them coming up with trump i mean they genuinely hate him i'm
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:03.960]  not trying to lionize him but you can't help it
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:07.160]  when he's totally surrounded by traders being attacked from every angle
[2:39:07.160 --> 2:39:10.520]  and still delivering propping up the stock market they admit he's the one that's
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:14.280]  done it with the democrats running around cheerleading for it to fall
[2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:17.640]  i mean they better get into some big trouble if they cause a depression
[2:39:17.640 --> 2:39:21.640]  uh i mean these people are just crazy what is their problem
[2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:26.040]  well well alan i think i mean alex you you hit it up my assistant says alan
[2:39:26.040 --> 2:39:28.840]  is ready alex i get i get names all the wrong i mean
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:32.200]  wrong time to sir go ahead i don't care get it on the head fundamentally as
[2:39:32.200 --> 2:39:35.000]  as you know when you study political history
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:39.320]  trump's uh election was a necessary disruption to a corrupt system
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:43.400]  and when and he basically it was like the shot being fought in lexington he
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:46.120]  basically fired the new shot of the new american revolution
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:49.720]  and after a revolution as we all know you have the counter revolution
[2:39:49.720 --> 2:39:53.320]  and that's what we're witnessing a civil war is taking place right now
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:56.680]  and that civil war is fundamentally to unseat
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:40:01.080]  donald trump but i would like to lionize him because in my opinion he's a
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:04.920]  great man a courageous man a true patriot he doesn't need to do this i know
[2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:07.960]  this as an entrepreneur i mean i have a multi billion dollar new
[2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:11.240]  startup i've started i don't need to do this but i love this country
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:14.200]  donald trump loves this country i know you love this country
[2:40:14.200 --> 2:40:18.280]  and it's time that we as patriots recognize and we came together to defend
[2:40:18.280 --> 2:40:21.400]  our president because these elitist academics
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:26.200]  they are basically furious not about donald trump because they lost control
[2:40:26.200 --> 2:40:29.640]  over those people who they called rednecks you know those people they
[2:40:29.640 --> 2:40:33.000]  thought are stupid that's what that's who they really do not like
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:36.840]  you know i i was living out in hollywood for uh several years as
[2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:40.440]  uh as owen may know one of the great people i did meet in hollywood is a
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:44.280]  great actor by the name of pierce brosnan pierce and his wife have put
[2:40:44.280 --> 2:40:46.200]  their money on the line and they've done a great
[2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:49.800]  movie called poisoning paradise i'm one of the scientists featured in it
[2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:53.560]  talking about what's going on to the destruction of kawaii the half of the
[2:40:53.560 --> 2:40:57.320]  island oh wow which as you talk about the
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:00.840]  military industrial complex has polluted for years has used it as a
[2:41:00.840 --> 2:41:04.440]  testing ground for a lot of the pesticides etc
[2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:07.800]  so what i recognize is we're in a very interesting point in human history you
[2:41:07.800 --> 2:41:11.640]  have uh basically certain angels coming out in in good
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:14.440]  ways and it's a disruptive environment so it's a very exciting
[2:41:14.440 --> 2:41:17.640]  environment and i think people like mit are probably horrified that they came
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:21.160]  me those four degrees let me just say this i want to get you on routinely
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:25.480]  uh because i just love talking to this guy is so smart just all these subjects
[2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:29.960]  that i he's just bam bam bam we need you as a u.s senator and think about that
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:33.080]  too that's what i was just going to say so you've got you've got shiva running
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:36.840]  against elizabeth warren that's like a speck of dust elizabeth warren versus
[2:41:36.840 --> 2:41:40.280]  a cut diamond that you're ready to put on a ring you know what i'm saying i mean
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:43.640]  this shouldn't even be a race i mean i'm not trying to you know line eyes you
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:46.520]  doctor that's true elizabeth warren has made nothing built nothing she's a
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:48.840]  bumbling lying idiot look at look at this guy
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:52.440]  look at dr sheeva's resume compared to elizabeth warren who claims she who
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:56.600]  lies to get into college about her heritage this is a speck of dust versus
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:42:00.040]  the diamond that's why these self-serving elitists i call them
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:03.320]  you know they know how to cut in line i mean think about it for her to mark
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:06.200]  off she was a native american is cutting in line
[2:42:06.200 --> 2:42:10.360]  the same aspect of allowing illegal aliens and you know my father came here
[2:42:10.360 --> 2:42:13.960]  legally we had to wait a year to come to this great country legally
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:17.160]  so that their concept is they have their own rules for themselves
[2:42:17.160 --> 2:42:20.680]  and we everyone else has their own rules they don't like to build a wall
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:23.720]  but the reality is every cell in the human body has a wall
[2:42:23.720 --> 2:42:27.480]  you know the atmosphere has a wall and nature in its divine
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:30.600]  uh design puts walls around the universe is a wall
[2:42:30.600 --> 2:42:35.160]  build a verdict right so these people don't want to follow
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:38.440]  nature's laws when it comes to them yet they want us
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:42.920]  uh to come up with their own ridiculous issues and as you said
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:46.600]  um alan is people like elizabeth warren need to be stopped
[2:42:46.600 --> 2:42:50.600]  and i believe that i was you know many ways from the heart my hard work and
[2:42:50.600 --> 2:42:53.720]  grandparents and my parents and this great country and the
[2:42:53.720 --> 2:42:57.080]  fathers of this country put me and gave me this opportunity at this point in
[2:42:57.080 --> 2:43:01.160]  history to stop someone like warren to basically support this new american
[2:43:01.160 --> 2:43:03.720]  revolution well it's exciting dr sheeva thank you
[2:43:03.720 --> 2:43:08.440]  so much we'll talk to you soon thanks alex right yes thanks for getting him
[2:43:08.440 --> 2:43:10.760]  on thank you sir remember following his story at the time
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:14.600]  well and i gotta tell you i'm i'm doing my best right now
[2:43:14.600 --> 2:43:17.640]  to reach out to people like dr sheeva and omar navarro
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:21.800]  i'm putting the swamp in my sight lines right now alex i'm putting the swamp
[2:43:21.800 --> 2:43:25.320]  in the crosshairs and elizabeth warren is part of that swamp
[2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:28.120]  maxine waters is part of that swamp i think we have another member of the
[2:43:28.120 --> 2:43:31.880]  swamp who identified himself today during these russia trump hearings and
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:34.840]  that's a democrat out of new mexico i think his name was hind rick
[2:43:34.840 --> 2:43:38.440]  so guess what hind rick now you're in my political sight lines and we're coming
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:41.000]  after you and we're going to find out who's running against you
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:44.360]  and you're going to lose your seat but real quick alex before i let you take
[2:43:44.360 --> 2:43:46.840]  these great calls i just want to have a couple quick points on everything
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:49.160]  dr sheeva said first he made a great point about
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:52.680]  democrats and liberals want to put the government in between you and your god
[2:43:52.680 --> 2:43:55.400]  they want to put the government in between you and your dreams they want to
[2:43:55.400 --> 2:43:57.560]  put the government in between you and your goals
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:02.600]  no this is america we have the direct contact with our dreams direct contact
[2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:05.640]  with our god we decide our own destiny i love that point
[2:44:05.640 --> 2:44:09.560]  he wins his lawsuit against gawker just another example of victory after victory
[2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:12.280]  after victory i'm not tired of winning yet
[2:44:12.280 --> 2:44:15.400]  he makes another great point about how the establishment in the media and the
[2:44:15.400 --> 2:44:19.080]  and politics thinks we're stupid i mean they really do alex i mean
[2:44:19.080 --> 2:44:21.720]  look i know we're not going to go down the megan kelly road but she thinks
[2:44:21.720 --> 2:44:25.240]  we're stupid she really thinks that she is a higher intellectual person than
[2:44:25.240 --> 2:44:29.080]  me she's not even close and then you have you got kind of a big argument with her
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:32.360]  i didn't get an argument with her i mean she i threw a couple jabs her she thought
[2:44:32.360 --> 2:44:35.000]  she could come in here and she thinks that we really think she's a big deal i
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.400]  really couldn't care less about megan kelly to be honest well here's the deal
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:40.920]  i don't want to be mean to her the point is she was mean to you to alex don't
[2:44:40.920 --> 2:44:44.600]  forget what she did to you oh i know the point was is she was like oh
[2:44:44.600 --> 2:44:48.440]  i know you're coming to do the pizza gate and the ciabani yogurt and the and
[2:44:48.440 --> 2:44:52.360]  the rest of it and and newtown that's just the thing they hammer on like at
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:56.360]  some defeat for us or whatever and she was oh no no no gay frogs which is
[2:44:56.360 --> 2:44:59.000]  provable and then constantly that's all it was for
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:01.640]  hours she has the same question like five times
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:05.720]  because they interviewed me basically all day long and for an 11 hour piece
[2:45:05.720 --> 2:45:08.920]  or 11 minute piece and i just felt completely empty at the end of it
[2:45:08.920 --> 2:45:12.840]  and so that's why i don't do those interviews is because well alex
[2:45:12.840 --> 2:45:16.520]  don't feel empty alex you did the right thing i'm telling you though she is like
[2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:20.040]  she ought to be in the new blade runner as a replicant robot
[2:45:20.040 --> 2:45:24.760]  i'm not being mean i'm like this fat toad creature but i mean she is like
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:27.160]  i don't want to get into her anymore we got to go to these callers okay just
[2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:29.640]  just can i make one more point for the callers uh and i want to hear your
[2:45:29.640 --> 2:45:34.040]  take on this reality winner is looking at jail 10 years espionage for the leak
[2:45:34.040 --> 2:45:36.600]  that she puts what about hillary clinton
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:40.360]  what about hillary clinton the same statute that they're saying reality
[2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:44.120]  winner violated hillary clinton did the exact same thing alex that's all i'm
[2:45:44.120 --> 2:45:48.040]  going to say take the cost and she's another person that says white
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:50.920]  genocide and they're they're always white
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:54.200]  and then she's just some spoiled brat works with the federal government
[2:45:54.200 --> 2:45:57.240]  and reportedly leaking stuff and what she leaked
[2:45:57.240 --> 2:46:00.600]  trump had anything to anything wrong it's nothing it's a report on nothing
[2:46:00.600 --> 2:46:03.320]  but that's the issue is what's the blowing is protected when you're
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:06.840]  exposing legal activity not when you're just leaking everything
[2:46:06.840 --> 2:46:11.160]  try to hurt the country it was a political smear attempt on trump
[2:46:11.160 --> 2:46:15.080]  and if she was smart she would have known that what she was leaking
[2:46:15.080 --> 2:46:18.680]  doesn't actually carry any weight doesn't have any water it's just a report
[2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:21.000]  it's not even intelligent all right i've got to go to jeff
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:24.600]  in in new jersey he just came back from paris he's been holding patiently
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:27.320]  talk about what's happening there with all the jihad attacks and the rest of it
[2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:31.880]  what did you see in uh paris jeff thank you for holding
[2:46:31.880 --> 2:46:35.160]  from thank you for having me on um well i just wanted to say
[2:46:35.160 --> 2:46:39.160]  came back from paris was also in uh basel and zerk and switcherlin and
[2:46:39.160 --> 2:46:43.400]  things are not looking too good i must say i you know my sister she teaches at
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:46.440]  the university the sort of bunch she's promoting your videos by the way you're
[2:46:46.440 --> 2:46:49.160]  burning up like crazy you're very popular they're very popular in swedish
[2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:55.240]  by the way um and say that um you know what happened with the
[2:46:55.240 --> 2:46:58.760]  it's gotten worse obviously with the migrants coming from the middle east and
[2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:02.600]  the athletes up who want to do stuff the way and all that but
[2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:07.160]  it's just the mess you know the one day it's just a it's just a total disaster
[2:47:07.160 --> 2:47:11.000]  and um i just wanted to say that you know it's it's
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:13.960]  i don't know what's going to happen and i really do feel bad for a country like
[2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:16.520]  switcherlin it's a country i grew up for part of my life
[2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:19.400]  the country that threw off neutrality has been a bulwark against the new world
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:25.080]  order it's a tyrannical hapsburg poli and all that stuff and uh
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:30.280]  they their arm they have uh you know they've only joined the un like 20 years
[2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:32.360]  ago and i don't think they're even happy about it
[2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:36.440]  and it's just depressing to watch really is once
[2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:41.320]  you know great places and the politicians you can tell they don't want
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:45.240]  to have they just keep on putting out the propaganda
[2:47:45.240 --> 2:47:49.080]  that you see in our media you see in their media but they're a little more
[2:47:49.080 --> 2:47:52.280]  sly about it they can be a little bit more like our
[2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:56.680]  media is that you could just tell their line there they kind of you know put it
[2:47:56.680 --> 2:48:00.280]  in and they don't really they they're kind of
[2:48:00.280 --> 2:48:03.640]  they mask it better so just want to talk about those things and
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:07.480]  as you said switzerland for 400 plus years is one of the freest countries
[2:48:07.480 --> 2:48:11.320]  richest country on earth a beautiful country and
[2:48:11.320 --> 2:48:15.000]  landlocked country and they have not entered
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:18.200]  in world war two they're not entering globalism but they're trying to force you
[2:48:18.200 --> 2:48:22.120]  into it the good news is the the euro is finally falling apart
[2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:25.800]  so hopefully we can go back to the independent states independent diversity
[2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:30.600]  independent sovereignty with more firewalls or bulkheads like in a ship
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:34.600]  so in case one gets taken over by a Hitler there isn't just one EU for him to
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:37.240]  take over which was an Aussie plan by the way
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:40.840]  so great point thank you so much for holding Jeff yeah we've had crew in
[2:48:40.840 --> 2:48:45.400]  Paris I see the reports of Paris 80 down the last
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:49.160]  decade half that 80 loss just last two or three years
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:53.000]  I mean it is our crew was there the beautiful areas
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:56.920]  there are just people laying around crapping all over the ground
[2:48:56.920 --> 2:49:01.080]  I mean it is just in when I was in Italy last year
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:07.000]  it was unbelievable there were just homeless people from the middle east
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:11.080]  just everywhere like there'd be one tree out out out no you know sidewalk
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:14.680]  there'd be like five guys under it
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:18.120]  and just crapping on the side of the ground I mean what what is going on
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:21.880]  Alex and I certainly do not wish that this would happen at all I want to be
[2:49:21.880 --> 2:49:25.080]  very clear but can you imagine do you think the narrative would have
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:28.280]  changed if during the Manchester attack it wasn't
[2:49:28.280 --> 2:49:31.800]  just civilians that died but instead it was Ariana Grande that was a victim
[2:49:31.800 --> 2:49:34.520]  oh yeah could you imagine do you think the narrative would still be the same
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:37.000]  today do you think they'd still be preaching tolerance and open borders
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:41.800]  and it's not radical Islamic terror but the thing is the elites on purpose are
[2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:46.280]  imploding the Middle East and Africa right it's and then and then into into
[2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:50.120]  Italy bringing not even women and kids
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:52.840]  used to you'd bring women and kid refugees because you could assimilate
[2:49:52.840 --> 2:49:56.280]  them even they came from a barbarous place no we're no the women you stay back
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:50:00.280]  we'll spring a bunch of crazy men or the men were actually fighting
[2:50:00.280 --> 2:50:03.400]  the resistance that was going on in the country the actual war that was going
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:06.840]  on so they wanted to stay behind and fight for their land got the women out
[2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:10.200]  got the women out no that's not the case they're invading now they're leaving
[2:50:10.200 --> 2:50:12.680]  the country because that's because that's muslin men I mean they're leaving
[2:50:12.680 --> 2:50:16.360]  their women like their dogs and and you know they're they're coming to the
[2:50:16.360 --> 2:50:20.200]  happy hunting land and then they find the Swedish girls bent over saying let's go
[2:50:20.200 --> 2:50:24.040]  go exist totally liberal please write me I mean that's in the news I say please
[2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:27.720]  just it's not rape you just except then they got one of it 20 guys are gonna do
[2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:30.280]  this no I guess the wristband remember they tried the wristbands that said
[2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:33.160]  please don't rape me those didn't work so I guess now they're just gonna take it
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:38.040]  but it's like someone's writing a dark satire book this is like 10 times
[2:50:38.040 --> 2:50:43.480]  for Kurt Vonnegut whatever right this is so ridiculous I mean what is it
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:49.560]  it's mental illness it's mental illness in mass worldwide all right folks we're
[2:50:49.560 --> 2:50:53.880]  gonna come back and we're gonna go to who's been holding longest Ian Ian thank
[2:50:53.880 --> 2:50:57.800]  you for holding I'm gonna go right to you then Jason in Germany Carlos John and
[2:50:57.800 --> 2:51:02.520]  others stay with us it's been said any society is only three missed meals away
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:07.480]  from chaos those times may be near think about it our country faces multiple
[2:51:07.480 --> 2:51:11.640]  terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea social unrest and
[2:51:11.640 --> 2:51:15.240]  violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns
[2:51:15.240 --> 2:51:19.200]  and a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term

[2:54:17.840 --> 2:54:21.840]  such amazing in-house writers we have other great writers of the right for us
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:26.600]  like Clifford Cunningham who visited last week and Dan Lyman they just broke two
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:31.320]  big bombshell stories but I've got to go to your calls so we'll have to maybe
[2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:35.400]  get to these next hour when Roger Stone's coming in but AG sessions in
[2:54:35.400 --> 2:54:41.080]  Obama's DOJ slush fund for far-left groups they were getting that money out
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:45.680]  of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other areas notice info wars began this
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:50.520]  investigation four months ago now it's all confirmed real action and what's
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:54.600]  crazy is it's the articles like this that don't get a lot of attention that
[2:54:54.600 --> 2:54:59.280]  are big in DC so I'm not bragging but I'm not unless there's no what they're
[2:54:59.280 --> 2:55:03.840]  really angry about is that course he's getting White House leaks not of secret
[2:55:03.840 --> 2:55:07.120]  stuff but of White House knowledge stuff they're kind of saving leaks it's
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:12.920]  tips we get White House tips and congressional tips and CIA tips by good
[2:55:12.920 --> 2:55:17.960]  people to then expose it and it's all there they tell us where to look with
[2:55:17.960 --> 2:55:22.000]  stuff that's open source but not known well they know the mainstream news won't
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  report on it yes so they come to us and here it is AG sessions so Trump's been
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  mad at him because you know he's like their criminals go after him and then
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.880]  he's like but that'll look political Trump's like I don't care you know it's
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:35.160]  true they're coming after him for nothing go after him but this is a big
[2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:39.720]  move that's on info wars.com there's another one globalist to push EU flags
[2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:44.680]  EU teams at 2024 Olympics they've already started saying the new teams can't be
[2:55:44.680 --> 2:55:49.320]  named the French this or the Spanish that or the Greek this and then or the Dutch
[2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:54.080]  that it's got to be named like the T-Rex or the such and such nothing to do with
[2:55:54.080 --> 2:55:59.480]  nation states so see they're even they know the final nationalism is sports so
[2:55:59.480 --> 2:56:02.640]  first they take your nationalism from sovereignty and issues and put it on
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:06.600]  sports then they get rid of that form of nationalism European Union officials
[2:56:06.600 --> 2:56:10.320]  and their allies are using the 20 24 Olympics games which are likely to be
[2:56:10.320 --> 2:56:14.360]  held in Paris as the opportunity to consolidate power and solidarity with the
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:17.960]  block see you can't have nation states and solidarity we'll talk about that
[2:56:17.960 --> 2:56:22.560]  later in the next hour briefly because I'm going right to Ian and others super

[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:28.480]  broadcasting from deep in the heart of texas
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:33.240]  Ian Novata thank you for holding your real trooper thank you go ahead
[3:00:33.240 --> 3:00:46.920]  hello am I on the air you are thank you for holding go ahead I think he needs to
[3:00:46.920 --> 3:00:52.240]  go after the bushes and his acquaintance before they can actually run again in
[3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:58.640]  2020 and then he needs to do what he can to stop the globalists from enforcing
[3:00:58.640 --> 3:01:04.400]  their policies by taking away all their ability to enforce it like going after
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:08.760]  their the globalist nation controlled satellite and just bring those out so
[3:01:08.760 --> 3:01:12.880]  that they can't launch EMPs or nuclear weapons well I think the answer is we
[3:01:12.880 --> 3:01:16.320]  take control of all those satellites and things but I mean what do you think of
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:21.560]  sessions this is just now breaking taking away Obama's DOJ slush fund for far
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:26.120]  left cop killer grips and stuff that's what's crazy the DOJ was literally
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:32.240]  stealing billions out of the Fannie Mae Freddie Mac banking fund to give it to
[3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:37.000]  literal terrorist organizations for non-citizens I mean it's just it's
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:40.280]  incredible they've all got to be arrested for all the VA struggles Ian I
[3:01:40.280 --> 3:01:44.680]  appreciate your calls a great point let's talk to Carlos and Canada Carlos
[3:01:44.680 --> 3:01:50.840]  you're on the air thank you Alex I echo the sentiments of Jerome Corsi I
[3:01:50.840 --> 3:01:55.880]  believe President Trump right now should really listen to his kind of advice
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:02:00.840]  it's very very important also there are two meetings that will probably take
[3:02:00.840 --> 3:02:07.640]  place before the presidency of Donald Trump ends one of them I believe will
[3:02:07.640 --> 3:02:12.960]  be relating to the Federal Reserve President Trump must bring in the
[3:02:12.960 --> 3:02:18.760]  Federal Reserve chairman and have a good frank talk to say what was conceived
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:24.440]  in 1913 has become obsolete several years ago it is a debt based system that
[3:02:24.440 --> 3:02:29.120]  no longer serves the American boy he knows that he's supposedly doing what
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:32.040]  he wants now but I don't think that's enough I think you should fire all of
[3:02:32.040 --> 3:02:38.040]  them sorry go ahead well he shouldn't necessarily fire them because he can
[3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:43.000]  change bank accounts you know it's it's a Federal Reserve powerful president is
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:47.240]  he's the only guy that has anything to do with that and it's private and only a
[3:02:47.240 --> 3:02:50.400]  president can kill it it's why they're so scared just like the president does the
[3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:54.480]  FBI director he needs to take action well then briefly what should he do
[3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:58.520]  because right now I know we're under a Federal Reserve system that's a fraud but
[3:02:58.520 --> 3:03:02.080]  he should use it to flood money to the public because we're in a stalled out
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:05.480]  position here and then reform it from that point I don't think you can reform
[3:03:05.480 --> 3:03:09.400]  it from a dead collapse position Ron Paul agrees with that by the way he
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:15.640]  agrees with what Trump's doing I agree but there is a system called the public
[3:03:15.640 --> 3:03:22.560]  bank system several states have now begun to look at it I think Senator Paul
[3:03:22.560 --> 3:03:30.560]  is aware of this and if President Trump were to examine seriously each state by
[3:03:30.560 --> 3:03:37.760]  state creating a public bank to replace the federal government having to go to
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:42.120]  the Federal Reserve but rather the states and the federal government go to
[3:03:42.120 --> 3:03:46.560]  the public bank system the public bank system is very different because it
[3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:51.440]  doesn't it is not like the Federal Reserve where you know it's a private
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:55.640]  entity this would be a public entity belonging to all Americans and it would
[3:03:55.640 --> 3:03:59.400]  be administered by the Treasury no I don't have a problem with a with a with a
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:02.480]  federal bank if it is federal and totally transparent like a state bank
[3:04:02.480 --> 3:04:07.680]  state banks are great systems built the country and I'm all for credit to the
[3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:11.480]  little guy and if we're not to be discriminatory thanks for the call you
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:15.280]  want to comment on that well I think that the Federal Reserve is so out of
[3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:19.520]  control just getting people to realize that there's a private banking entity
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:25.160]  behind it would just be the first step to trying to to wrangle it back into our
[3:04:25.160 --> 3:04:28.880]  control but I'm not sure if the Federal Reserve fractional Reserve banking
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:33.280]  system is even is even a pliable option for the future to be honest I don't see
[3:04:33.280 --> 3:04:36.880]  how we could ever come out of this debt well they're the ones running globalism
[3:04:36.880 --> 3:04:40.880]  you look at the shareholders the New York Fed that's really runs at all it's
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:44.360]  mainly European banks that have been trying to take this country back since
[3:04:44.360 --> 3:04:47.440]  they lost it but if anyone understands the finances like that it's President
[3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:52.200]  Trump it's not Obama it's not yelling all right ladies and gentlemen more
[3:04:52.200 --> 3:04:57.320]  calls straight ahead and then Roger Stone joins us stay with us
[3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:09.560]  Chelsea Clinton has just released a new children's book and it's about 13
[3:05:09.560 --> 3:05:16.320]  historical women who pursued their goals in the face of opposition the rebel
[3:05:16.320 --> 3:05:21.400]  media caught up with Chelsea at a book signing event and had the brilliant idea
[3:05:21.400 --> 3:05:27.880]  of asking her to sign the book titled she persisted for Juanita Broderick who as
[3:05:27.880 --> 3:05:34.600]  we all know was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and silenced by Hillary
[3:05:34.600 --> 3:05:38.040]  when you sign up for my friend Juanita Broderick because she's been silenced by
[3:05:38.040 --> 3:05:41.720]  your parents especially Bill Clinton who's a great best can you sign it for
[3:05:41.720 --> 3:05:48.840]  her naturally Chelsea refused to sign the book but her reaction was priceless

[3:11:13.240 --> 3:11:17.680]  just hold up Hillary Clinton's a terrorist or Bill Clinton's a rapist or
[3:11:17.680 --> 3:11:22.240]  CNN's terrorist you can buy the t-shirts by the way of that or just print the PDF
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:26.640]  soft the page twenty thousand two hundred thousand dollars in cash prizes in
[3:11:26.640 --> 3:11:30.880]  fours launches operation expose terrorist media Kathy Griffin but it can be
[3:11:30.880 --> 3:11:36.800]  whatever I deem whatever works whatever is successful I will deem it that's why
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:40.400]  it's up to me who wins but I want to pay you even folks that didn't enter and I
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:45.800]  said you did something great exposing CNN $2500 okay so that's how it works but
[3:11:45.800 --> 3:11:48.560]  then you can have moles come in and try to sue me for no reason so I've got to
[3:11:48.560 --> 3:11:51.920]  have the language it's all up to me and you know blah blah blah but we've had
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:54.880]  many of these contests I've paid out hundreds of thousands before an
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:11:59.720]  individual contest it's happening it's going on but separately I had another
[3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:04.360]  contest that I'm so sure of I launched today but only one person can enter the
[3:12:04.360 --> 3:12:10.880]  contest and that's Chelsea Hubble the stories on info wars.com Chelsea
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:16.520]  Clinton offered one million for DNA test proving Webster Hubble is not her
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:21.400]  father it's got to be with a third party with video cameras there as they do the
[3:12:21.400 --> 3:12:28.000]  DNA test we can't have that I have the experts people that knew them all of it
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:32.920]  her and a Hubble hung out at the law firm Rose law firm they were a known item
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:37.140]  and besides I'm not trying to be mean Hubble looks like he has a genetic
[3:12:37.140 --> 3:12:50.040]  disorder the way he talks ever saw him testify he's like this look and so you
[3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:54.040]  look at it I mean let's just say it I don't mean it mean she's an ugly person
[3:12:54.040 --> 3:12:57.560]  for helping steal the money from the Haitians it's in the WikiLeaks she knows
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:00.280]  they stole she talks about we're killing these people they're like that's what we
[3:13:00.280 --> 3:13:03.920]  do and she went along with it she went along with the murder of Haitians with
[3:13:03.920 --> 3:13:08.120]  the UN crapping in their UN water supply giving them Colorado and the rape
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:12.400]  gangs the huge AP study about the thousands of children hundreds of
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:16.360]  murdered the Clintons overseeing it with giant child kidnapping rings notice
[3:13:16.360 --> 3:13:19.440]  they don't attack me and say that's fake because that we first broke that that
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:24.680]  was an AP a month ago so this monster this pig wants to run around with her
[3:13:24.680 --> 3:13:28.840]  new foundations this this Webster Hubble's daughter this is a vampire of
[3:13:28.840 --> 3:13:36.440]  Haitian blood this night creature I mean a horse of the horse of course of
[3:13:36.440 --> 3:13:42.440]  course that is of course unless the horse of the famous Mr. Redd what no
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:47.320]  nothing but Mr. Redd didn't rob starving and dying Haitian children so and you
[3:13:47.320 --> 3:13:52.040]  know cover up the UN operation so gloves are off with her she's supposed to be
[3:13:52.040 --> 3:13:59.480]  the head of the new UN global tyranny medical system but that's all blown up
[3:13:59.480 --> 3:14:04.600]  in her face and so Mr. Redd meets meets Webster Hubble I dare the media to pick
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:09.640]  up on this because 1 million smackers and I'm not made out of money but I know
[3:14:09.640 --> 3:14:14.440]  that if it's done with a real third-party live that's Webster Hubble's
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:20.040]  daughter there's never been genetic features closer it's never no one on
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:25.160]  earth has that small upper lip and that gigantic bottom lip nobody's got eyes
[3:14:25.160 --> 3:14:28.760]  it looked like that nobody's got eyebrows I mean that's Webster Hubble
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:33.880]  wearing a wig so joining us is one of the main experts exposing all of this
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:38.840]  Roger Stone Roger do you think she'll take me up on it do you think Webster
[3:14:38.840 --> 3:14:42.720]  Hubble's daughter will take me up on it well I think a lot of people need to
[3:14:42.720 --> 3:14:48.080]  realize Alex is those who say oh you're picking on a child Chelsea Clinton is a
[3:14:48.080 --> 3:14:52.360]  30-year-old adult based on reports published in the New York Palace
[3:14:52.360 --> 3:14:58.560]  Post and elsewhere she's very much like her mother abusive foul-mouthed greedy
[3:14:58.560 --> 3:15:04.840]  entitled and not terribly bright of course Bill and Hillary have kind of left
[3:15:04.840 --> 3:15:10.440]  her holding the bag because she's an officer of the Clinton Foundation she's
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:17.000]  on the documents filed with the IRS and therefore she's local she's legally
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:22.520]  culpable for the numerous crimes that have been committed there the Clinton
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:28.040]  Foundation as you know is not a charity it's a slush fund for grifters and it's
[3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:32.920]  been the vehicle for multi-million-dollar bribes and influence peddling
[3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:41.280]  and Chelsea is actually thinking about running for Congress in a district just
[3:15:41.280 --> 3:15:49.160]  north of New York City that is held by Congresswoman Anita Lowy I'm told that
[3:15:49.160 --> 3:15:55.320]  if she really runs Danny Williams the abandoned son of Bill Clinton who
[3:15:55.320 --> 3:15:59.720]  currently lives in Arkansas but could move into that district certainly in
[3:15:59.720 --> 3:16:05.280]  time to run with an eye towards the 40% African-American vote in the
[3:16:05.280 --> 3:16:13.000]  Democratic primary so it could be an epic clash of the offspring of Chelsea of
[3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:18.200]  Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton sure well she just got told again they're not
[3:16:18.200 --> 3:16:22.520]  brother and sister Alex because they do not share a common father that's right
[3:16:22.520 --> 3:16:26.760]  let's expand on that I mean let's talk seriously she's obviously Webster Hubble's
[3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:31.160]  daughter I've been hearing that for 22 years from the folks locally it was
[3:16:31.160 --> 3:16:36.840]  well known but what's your intel on it but I mean he has striking probably I
[3:16:36.840 --> 3:16:42.360]  don't mean this as a funny thing but he looks like he has birth defect type
[3:16:42.360 --> 3:16:47.600]  genetics that is very rare and very expressive I mean this looks like he has
[3:16:47.600 --> 3:16:51.200]  some type of genetic disorder and it appears that that genetic disorder
[3:16:51.200 --> 3:16:56.480]  whatever it is has been passed on these are strikingly strikingly you know
[3:16:56.480 --> 3:17:01.320]  nuclear fallout victim features well I think it goes beyond just the physical
[3:17:01.320 --> 3:17:05.520]  resemblance between Webster Hubble and his daughter first of all there is the
[3:17:05.520 --> 3:17:09.920]  fact that LD Brown who is a personal bodyguard and driver for Bill Clinton
[3:17:09.920 --> 3:17:14.200]  says that Clinton told him that he read about Hillary's pregnancy in the
[3:17:14.200 --> 3:17:19.880]  newspaper secondarily there is the fact that the world net daily contacted Mr.
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:25.480]  Hubble asked him point blank if he was Chelsea's father whereupon he said no
[3:17:25.480 --> 3:17:34.840]  comment and he hung up no denial it is also true that that Larry Nichols said
[3:17:34.840 --> 3:17:40.120]  that Hillary Clinton was overheard saying if I have to do Web Hubble to get
[3:17:40.120 --> 3:17:45.040]  into the Rose Law firm I will do so also in Hillary Clinton's own book she says
[3:17:45.040 --> 3:17:51.200]  that a large football player size man taught her the proper way to hold a
[3:17:51.200 --> 3:17:57.320]  baby that doesn't sound like Bill Clinton to me well but they're striking I
[3:17:57.320 --> 3:18:01.680]  mean it's like if somebody had a genetic disorder where they're like you know or
[3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:06.160]  missing their teeth or don't have a nose I mean I don't mean to make fun of her
[3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:12.080]  but she is such a monster such a pig I mean she's in the emails you know talk
[3:18:12.080 --> 3:18:15.080]  about dying people and other killing people and she didn't do anything about
[3:18:15.080 --> 3:18:21.120]  it so I like and as you know Alex she's had multiple plastic surgeries and
[3:18:21.120 --> 3:18:28.320]  an attempt to minimize her resemblance to her father so look she is clearly the
[3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:34.240]  Clinton Foundation is still in existence the Clinton political machine is still
[3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:39.480]  in existence and just as Hillary's having a hard time getting off the stage
[3:18:39.480 --> 3:18:44.560]  with her selective memory in that performance at Wellesley in all honesty
[3:18:44.560 --> 3:18:48.600]  in a perfect world when Hillary Clinton came down off the platform at Wensley
[3:18:48.600 --> 3:18:53.360]  Wellesley from giving the commencement address she should have been handcuffed
[3:18:53.360 --> 3:18:59.520]  by federal marshals because it's time for Jeff Sessions to convene a grand jury
[3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:04.840]  and examine the criminal activity of the Clinton Foundation John Podesta Tony
[3:19:04.840 --> 3:19:08.800]  Podesta what they were doing with the Russians what they were doing with the
[3:19:08.800 --> 3:19:13.720]  oligarchs around Russia hold on let's talk about Comey coming up and take a
[3:19:13.720 --> 3:19:16.760]  few calls I promise whether I'll let you take over Roger Stone so you'll have
[3:19:16.760 --> 3:19:19.520]  your own show five days a week so won't matter when I'm cutting in there's
[3:19:19.520 --> 3:19:22.520]  will be too much time for me to even be able to do that but since we're talking
[3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:27.440]  about Chelsea Hubble Clinton in the new contest a million dollars for her if
[3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:31.680]  she'll get a paternity test I thought we should actually hear from her under the
[3:19:31.680 --> 3:19:35.440]  fairness doctor and actually hear a statement from her here it is
[3:19:35.440 --> 3:19:44.840]  hello I'm Mr. Red a horse is a horse of
[3:19:44.840 --> 3:19:48.840]  course of course and no one can talk to a horse of course that is of course
[3:19:48.840 --> 3:19:54.120]  unless the horse is the famous Mr. Red go right to the source and ask the horse
[3:19:54.120 --> 3:19:58.400]  he'll give you the answer that you endorse he's always on a steady course
[3:19:58.400 --> 3:20:02.120]  talk to Mr. Red
[3:20:03.320 --> 3:20:07.040]  that horse could be a million dollars richer I was about to say the horses are
[3:20:07.040 --> 3:20:10.160]  beautiful but it's actually on the show and they give it peanut butter whatever
[3:20:10.160 --> 3:20:14.240]  that's lips was oh Wilbur because he's I used to I was fascinated by
[3:20:14.240 --> 3:20:17.240]  Webster Hubble in the 90s he was always testifying in Congress about some
[3:20:17.240 --> 3:20:21.640]  scandal and it was like only thing that moves his bottom lip you go the fact
[3:20:21.640 --> 3:20:25.880]  guys go YouTube or go to C-SPAN's own archive just type in Webster Hubble
[3:20:25.880 --> 3:20:31.440]  testifies and it's the craziest thing you've ever seen it made me believe
[3:20:31.440 --> 3:20:34.080]  David Ike there's like reptoids running things I don't really believe that but
[3:20:34.080 --> 3:20:36.800]  what is seriously I don't mean to make fun of people what they look usually
[3:20:36.800 --> 3:20:39.040]  and we're gonna go to Jason and Jeremy and John I don't know and I'm gonna get
[3:20:39.040 --> 3:20:41.960]  out here and let you take over but but what is going on with Webster Hubble I
[3:20:41.960 --> 3:20:46.440]  mean what is this guy's deal well I think it's very important he's the guy who
[3:20:46.440 --> 3:20:50.080]  does the dirty work for the Clintons he's the deputy attorney general of the
[3:20:50.080 --> 3:20:55.800]  United States under Janet Reno he's supposed to be Reno's manager Hillary
[3:20:55.800 --> 3:21:00.640]  Clinton selected Janet Reno Janet Reno acted on Hillary Clinton's orders
[3:21:00.640 --> 3:21:05.000]  Hillary Clinton is the one who orders Janet Reno to launch the assault at
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:11.160]  Waco and it is Webster Hubble who transmits that order Hillary to her
[3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:18.000]  lover lover Hubble the father of her child to Janet Reno and as you know as
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:24.120]  many as 18 children under the age of eight die in that in that conflagration
[3:21:24.120 --> 3:21:30.720]  that unnecessary confrontation but it was liberal so it's okay well it is it
[3:21:30.720 --> 3:21:35.960]  is horrific the brute force that the federal government uses on these you
[3:21:35.960 --> 3:21:40.160]  know on these outcasts and the disinformation about them abusing
[3:21:40.160 --> 3:21:44.920]  children and so on they killed 18 children under eight in a firefight who
[3:21:44.920 --> 3:21:48.080]  stands up for children who's an advocate for children Hillary Clinton
[3:21:48.080 --> 3:21:53.840]  murders children there you have it man Webster Hubble is so weird that's a
[3:21:53.840 --> 3:21:58.000]  side shot they got straight on to in Congress that's fine it is unbelievable
[3:21:58.000 --> 3:22:01.520]  that's what Chelsea looks like when she talks to and she has the same forehead
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:06.720]  and everything yeah it's that whole rubber lip thing that rubber face even
[3:22:06.720 --> 3:22:10.600]  yeah that's it they look back yet it looks like a rubber mask yeah I'm not
[3:22:10.600 --> 3:22:14.640]  making fun of the fact that they look like cavemen or something I don't know
[3:22:14.640 --> 3:22:19.760]  what's going on well and just look at the if you just look at the two families
[3:22:19.760 --> 3:22:23.000]  just on the table right here you say here's the Clinton family versus the
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:27.360]  Trump family here's the Trump family a good people hard-working building
[3:22:27.360 --> 3:22:32.040]  things prosperous tight family together have each other's back then you have the
[3:22:32.040 --> 3:22:37.240]  Clinton family you have a a a son who's besmirched from the family he's not
[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:40.800]  even allowed to exist they completely deny Danny Williams existence then you
[3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:45.240]  have Chelsea Clinton Hubble who's actually not even the son of Bill Clinton
[3:22:45.240 --> 3:22:49.560]  so there's the Clinton family a complete nightmare a complete disaster not
[3:22:49.560 --> 3:22:53.680]  what you want your family to be like versus the Trump family which is more
[3:22:53.680 --> 3:22:56.440]  like what you would want your family to be like the bigger thing is they're
[3:22:56.440 --> 3:23:01.200]  constantly robbing everything old folks pension funds land Haitians there's just
[3:23:01.200 --> 3:23:06.160]  a group of disgusting filth Roger Stone is hosting right now but he was me a
[3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:09.360]  little bit late so we took over he's with us you know break down come here in
[3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:12.320]  just a couple minutes right now John Illinois then Jason in Germany and we'll
[3:23:12.320 --> 3:23:19.040]  be out of here John in Illinois go ahead you're on the air hey Alex hey Roger I
[3:23:19.040 --> 3:23:23.080]  was actually calling about something that's been bothering me these past few
[3:23:23.080 --> 3:23:30.320]  months we've been watching the Muslim extremist running over the West and its
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:36.480]  valleys so if you're like me and you've been getting mad at this this is your
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:41.360]  chance to do something about it this Saturday June 10 act for America is
[3:23:41.360 --> 3:23:46.040]  having a march against Sharia and we need everybody there the lefties are
[3:23:46.040 --> 3:23:49.080]  going to be counter protesting you know they're probably going to bring the
[3:23:49.080 --> 3:23:52.640]  black block in and start getting violent or whatever which is why we need
[3:23:52.640 --> 3:23:58.760]  people there with cameras documenting observing and just you know acting for
[3:23:58.760 --> 3:24:02.760]  America for American values wow that's something we need to cover just to show
[3:24:02.760 --> 3:24:06.760]  how these comeback communists are on the side of people you know like literally
[3:24:06.760 --> 3:24:11.520]  cut women's genitals off like there's one in Austin the guys could zoom in on
[3:24:11.520 --> 3:24:15.320]  that map it looked like they had one in Austin oh really the March against Sharia
[3:24:15.320 --> 3:24:22.480]  yeah March against Sharia it's by act for America it's an organization started
[3:24:22.480 --> 3:24:28.920]  by Bridget Gabriel who was born in Lebanese and she's Middle Eastern her
[3:24:28.920 --> 3:24:33.360]  family were Christians and they were driven away from their own country
[3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:38.560]  because of Muslim extremists in the 80s so she came over here and she's just a
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:44.080]  great patriot now standing up for American values and you know these are
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:48.000]  the types of people we need to support and it's not even about race it's not
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:52.340]  even about church about a cult like ideology it's about a cult like ideology
[3:24:52.340 --> 3:24:55.960]  all right we'll we'll look into it I've heard of the group very interesting
[3:24:55.960 --> 3:25:03.000]  great point anything else Sean just one more thing I you know I like Trump I
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:08.240]  like what he's doing but I just want to say that I don't like the arms deal with
[3:25:08.240 --> 3:25:13.920]  Saudi Arabia and we need to support Rand Paul blocking of that deal because
[3:25:13.920 --> 3:25:18.320]  mark my words those weapons are gonna have they're gonna land in the hands of
[3:25:18.320 --> 3:25:23.160]  ISIS and are gonna end up killing American citizens and Trump will be his
[3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:26.560]  legacy will be destroyed because of that I hear it's a good point let me get
[3:25:26.560 --> 3:25:30.160]  Roger Stone's take on that because I see what Trump do he just wants gross
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:34.620]  numbers to get the economy going Saudi Arabia got fighter bombers and high
[3:25:34.620 --> 3:25:38.080]  tech missiles I don't disagree with the caller totally but that's not gonna get
[3:25:38.080 --> 3:25:42.800]  in the hands of ISIS and it's seen as a deal to get them to stop you know trying
[3:25:42.800 --> 3:25:46.840]  to use civil war to take down Iran but to give them weapons to stand up against
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:50.960]  Iran in case I ran attacks but Rogers told the time said it made him sick to
[3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:54.120]  watch that he still likes Trump but that didn't make him sick Roger your take on
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:25:59.320]  that yeah I want to be very clear what made me sick Alex was the photograph of
[3:25:59.320 --> 3:26:04.280]  the president bowing to the Saudi king if the Saudi king wants to give our
[3:26:04.280 --> 3:26:09.360]  president a medal he can stand on a soapbox in other words the president's
[3:26:09.360 --> 3:26:14.120]  handler should never have allowed him to be seen that way he did not bow to the
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:19.800]  Saudi leaders when he first met them as Obama did his genuflection was polite
[3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:24.160]  but nothing outrageous well he curtsy so you get it over his head this was this
[3:26:24.160 --> 3:26:29.120]  was a bow and it shows up sequence and that photograph is now used in the
[3:26:29.120 --> 3:26:35.000]  Islamic world is propaganda I understand why the president feels that he must
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:42.000]  must play off the the Saudis against Iran right now a nuclear Iran is a greater
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:46.320]  problem not to say that he trusts the Saudis not that he doesn't understand
[3:26:46.320 --> 3:26:51.680]  their transgressions so this is high stakes you know breakmanship this is
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:27:00.840]  Nixon style foreign policy maneuver but I tend to agree that the Saudis who
[3:27:00.840 --> 3:27:05.280]  clearly have a role in the attack on 9-11 ultimately have to be held
[3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:09.440]  accountable by this president they both houses of Congress and past
[3:27:09.440 --> 3:27:15.360]  legislation that as you know Alex would require them to pay the families in
[3:27:15.360 --> 3:27:21.200]  New York who are successful in bringing a lawsuit they resist that so it's it's a
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:25.680]  delicate balance on overall I approve what the president did in terms of
[3:27:25.680 --> 3:27:31.920]  utilizing the Saudis in this chess game with Iran on the other hand they have to
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:35.320]  pay up ultimately and I think the president knows that absolutely but
[3:27:35.320 --> 3:27:38.600]  pulling us out of the climate deal all of it's amazing last call I got time for
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:41.720]  resistance stones got big news on coming the inside scoop I shouldn't even be
[3:27:41.720 --> 3:27:44.760]  cutting in here Jason in Germany but I promise to your calls Jason you're on
[3:27:44.760 --> 3:27:50.040]  here thank you Alex I have one minute probably or two and I probably need more
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:54.400]  like 10 but I'll try to go real fast first a little bone to pick with you I
[3:27:54.400 --> 3:27:58.400]  know you guys are super busy but it's been two weeks since I submitted my
[3:27:58.400 --> 3:28:02.920]  article to you and I haven't heard back from anybody I really need you I need
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:06.040]  somebody to look at that article because it's a hundred percent Veritas I know
[3:28:06.040 --> 3:28:08.840]  that's what you're just good we're trying to get a better crew to get more
[3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:11.480]  articles from you guys and we're doing what we're trying hard what was the
[3:28:11.480 --> 3:28:16.640]  title of the articles we can search it in our email okay it's called can Trump
[3:28:16.640 --> 3:28:23.080]  save himself and us too it's it's got my name and in the subject line as well you
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:26.280]  can tweet that at me if you tweeted at me I can try to find out one thing to do
[3:28:26.280 --> 3:28:28.880]  is all find your own place and post up that's the better way to get it to us
[3:28:28.880 --> 3:28:33.600]  to go ahead actually I posted on anonymous site and they
[3:28:33.600 --> 3:28:37.600]  classified it as state speech and took it down I couldn't believe it there's
[3:28:37.600 --> 3:28:42.160]  nothing hateful about it it real quick to my second point and I'm speaking
[3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:44.680]  totally from my heart here Alex I know this is something you can totally relate
[3:28:44.680 --> 3:28:48.000]  to when you have when you feel it when you have the understanding of complex
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:51.320]  issues that nobody else seems to have and you can actually articulate it in a
[3:28:51.320 --> 3:28:54.800]  way that other people can understand I believe that I have the zeitgeist of
[3:28:54.800 --> 3:28:58.320]  what Americans want and need and I believe that if Trump will give it to
[3:28:58.320 --> 3:29:03.000]  them he will win and I can prove this going back to all my tweet history in
[3:29:03.000 --> 3:29:06.840]  fact it's so weird that just recently the fallout with Trump and sessions is
[3:29:06.840 --> 3:29:10.480]  hitting and it literally a couple weeks after your sessions came on you've
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:16.000]  called don't agree with this we really shouldn't be you know put marijuana
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:19.560]  smokers in prison for a thousand years he really should decriminalize doesn't
[3:29:19.560 --> 3:29:22.480]  agree with all marijuana culture I appreciate your call real quick Roger
[3:29:22.480 --> 3:29:26.720]  and take over your take on Trump and the marijuana well I just wish Jeff
[3:29:26.720 --> 3:29:32.080]  Sessions would focus more on Susan Rice and the and the illegal monitoring
[3:29:32.080 --> 3:29:37.240]  of Americans by the NSA and less on a victimless crime marijuana that's what
[3:29:37.240 --> 3:29:41.440]  I thought we appointed Jeff Sessions for and he's been less than aggressive on
[3:29:41.440 --> 3:29:45.880]  the president's behalf straight ahead Roger Stone is in the catbird seat
[3:29:45.880 --> 3:29:50.680]  breaking down the Comey here in tomorrow we're on the March the empires on
[3:29:50.680 --> 3:29:56.840]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:29:58.600 --> 3:30:02.040]  we have two major problems in this country when it comes to spending one is
[3:30:02.040 --> 3:30:05.440]  the warfare state and the other is the welfare state 13 Alabama County saw
[3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:09.640]  85% drop in food stamp participation after work requirements reinstated go
[3:30:09.640 --> 3:30:13.760]  figure so during the economic downturn between 2011 and 2013 several states
[3:30:13.760 --> 3:30:16.720]  including Alabama wave the snap work requirements in response to high
[3:30:16.720 --> 3:30:20.040]  unemployment Alabama reinstated the work requirements for 54 counties on January
[3:30:20.040 --> 3:30:25.080]  1st 2016 and then for the remaining 13 on January 1st 2017 among those 13
[3:30:25.080 --> 3:30:29.280]  counties there were 5,538 adults ages 18 to 50 without the penance receiving
[3:30:29.280 --> 3:30:33.600]  food stamps by May 1st of this year that number had dropped to 831 a decline of
[3:30:33.600 --> 3:30:37.800]  85% now remember snap is essentially an electronic soup line so we don't see
[3:30:37.800 --> 3:30:40.440]  people waiting in long lines to get food in soup kitchens they get them on a
[3:30:40.440 --> 3:30:42.760]  debit card which is another way the government gets to control you the
[3:30:42.760 --> 3:30:45.440]  Trump administration has bad to cut food stamp rolls over the next decade
[3:30:45.440 --> 3:30:48.280]  ensuring that able-bodied adult recipients are working and Democrats
[3:30:48.280 --> 3:30:50.840]  were up in arms about this but if you look at Alabama you can see that it
[3:30:50.840 --> 3:30:53.760]  really does work I'm all for helping people out if they need a hand but I
[3:30:53.760 --> 3:30:56.000]  work and there's no reason why other able-bodied people can't get out there

[3:33:09.640 --> 3:33:15.800]  you're listening to Roger stone on info wars
[3:33:19.760 --> 3:33:27.280]  welcome back I'm your host Roger stone sitting in for Alex Jones and oh and
[3:33:27.280 --> 3:33:32.600]  Shroyer who's obviously trying to do the young Abraham Lincoln thing all
[3:33:32.600 --> 3:33:38.560]  Washington is of course focused on the coming shootout at the okay Corral the
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:45.160]  classic clash between James Comey testifying before Congress and Donald
[3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:52.280]  Trump sitting at his Twitter feed this has the potential to be mesmerizing as
[3:33:52.280 --> 3:33:59.440]  both sides gear up for battle mr. Comey is widely expected to accuse the
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:06.120]  president of impeding the investigation into general Flynn and asking him to end
[3:34:06.120 --> 3:34:12.560]  it if mr. Comey wants to talk about obstruction and he wants to talk about
[3:34:12.560 --> 3:34:20.200]  memos because it is alleged that he wrote a memo according to the New York
[3:34:20.200 --> 3:34:27.960]  Times that that he pardon me he received a memo according to the Times he
[3:34:27.960 --> 3:34:35.680]  believed the memo to be real and that memo alleges obstruction at the highest
[3:34:35.680 --> 3:34:43.080]  level of the Obama administration now the memo has been since proved to be a
[3:34:43.080 --> 3:34:48.120]  forgery but mr. Comey believed it therefore he thought there was an
[3:34:48.120 --> 3:34:52.760]  obstruction of justice he did not report this as an officer of the court
[3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:59.040]  instead he furthered that obstruction this would of course explain why his
[3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:06.560]  comments about Hillary Clinton were so caustic yet he reached a conclusion that
[3:35:06.560 --> 3:35:13.600]  was the result of a political fix above him to me this shreds any credibility
[3:35:13.600 --> 3:35:20.200]  regarding mr. Comey mr. Comey alleges to the to the media that he has
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:25.760]  contemporaneous memos written to himself saying that the president was impeding
[3:35:25.760 --> 3:35:31.880]  justice why then did he not report these as an officer of the court why are we
[3:35:31.880 --> 3:35:37.920]  only learning this now the acting Attorney General mr. Rosenstiel in this
[3:35:37.920 --> 3:35:44.680]  matter says that there is no evidence of collusion by Donald Trump and his
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:50.280]  associates perhaps the president asked him to wrap up the investigation of
[3:35:50.280 --> 3:35:55.640]  general Flynn because based on what we have seen so far while general Flynn
[3:35:55.640 --> 3:36:00.920]  may have done some things that were inadvisable perhaps even stupid they
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:06.160]  didn't constitute crimes nor did they constitute collusion with the Russian
[3:36:06.160 --> 3:36:12.160]  state Trump can only win the the shootout tomorrow with an awful offensive
[3:36:12.160 --> 3:36:19.720]  strategy I remind you of stones rules attack attack attack mr. Comey has
[3:36:19.720 --> 3:36:25.880]  plenty of his record in his record to attack HSBC the International Bank has
[3:36:25.880 --> 3:36:29.320]  caught money laundering hundreds of thousands of dollars for the drug
[3:36:29.320 --> 3:36:35.640]  industry mr. Comey ensures that they pay a hefty fine but no one goes to jail
[3:36:35.640 --> 3:36:43.200]  there upon mr. Comey reach it goes on the board of directors at HSBC how much
[3:36:43.200 --> 3:36:54.080]  was he paid he also is associated with the various interests including Lockheed
[3:36:54.080 --> 3:37:00.760]  which is without any question the most corrupt company and defense
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:07.200]  contractor in defense contractor in the country they have enormous egregious
[3:37:07.200 --> 3:37:13.760]  violations of law and cost overruns again no one goes to jail their problems
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:19.920]  are all worked out and they pay fines which they can well afford and then they
[3:37:19.920 --> 3:37:27.320]  pay mr. Comey six million dollars the fact that James Comey was the
[3:37:27.320 --> 3:37:33.720]  prosecutor in the sandy rich pardon me the sandy burger affair you remember
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:40.200]  sandy burger he was Bill Clinton's national security adviser he slipped
[3:37:40.200 --> 3:37:46.280]  into the National Archives he talked a docent into leaving the room because he
[3:37:46.280 --> 3:37:52.720]  said he had to take a classified secret super secret cell phone call he then
[3:37:52.720 --> 3:37:58.520]  stuffed documents down the front of his pants that proved that Bill Clinton
[3:37:58.520 --> 3:38:05.400]  could have taken out Osama bin Laden but didn't the prosecutor in this case
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:11.920]  James Comey the charges brought none covering for the Clinton crime family
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:17.480]  then there's the mark rich matter you remember mark rich he was an
[3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:21.800]  international fugitive from justice a man who'd stole hundreds of millions of
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:27.240]  dollars he funneled huge million dollar contributions to the Clinton Foundation
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:33.560]  through his wife he skipped the entire pardon process only to receive a pardon
[3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:40.480]  at the last minute for for from president Clinton now James Comey had
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:46.200]  actually been the prosecutor in the mark rich case and then he was appointed to
[3:38:46.200 --> 3:38:52.360]  oversee whether there had been any impropriety of mr. Comey's purchase of
[3:38:52.360 --> 3:39:01.200]  pardon me mr. Rich's purchase of a pardon and again no charges were brought who
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:06.120]  can forget that mr. Comey emerged in the beginning as an assistant director of
[3:39:06.120 --> 3:39:13.160]  the whitewater inquiry whitewater is a complicated real estate transaction in
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:19.120]  which no one really makes money but Bill Clinton is able to extract eight hundred
[3:39:19.120 --> 3:39:25.200]  and fifty thousand dollars to finance the media blitz that returned him to the
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:30.920]  governor's mansion after losing in the previous election that sets the stage for
[3:39:30.920 --> 3:39:36.920]  his election as president of the United States Jim and Susan McDougal friends of
[3:39:36.920 --> 3:39:43.600]  the Clintons take the fall McDougal goes to prison and dies there when denied
[3:39:43.600 --> 3:39:50.360]  the medication he needed for survival and Susan McDougal refuses to testify
[3:39:50.360 --> 3:39:57.400]  against the president and is temporarily jailed mr. Comey assures that no
[3:39:57.400 --> 3:40:06.400]  charges are brought against the Clintons so this this FBI director call him Jay
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:13.240]  Edgar Comey if you will had become a law unto himself he would decide what
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:19.840]  crimes he would investigate and what crimes he would not it's important to
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:23.880]  know when senator Chuck Grassley who's the ranking member of the Senate
[3:40:23.880 --> 3:40:30.960]  Judiciary Committee asked mr. Comey about the fraudulent memo which claimed
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:36.520]  obstruction of justice by Lorena Lynch and the Clinton campaign mr. Comey
[3:40:36.520 --> 3:40:42.000]  declined to discuss it the New York Times tells us that there was widespread
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:48.120]  belief within the FBI that the document in question was a forgery yet mr. Comey
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:54.200]  chose to embrace it and based his decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton
[3:40:54.200 --> 3:41:02.040]  on the basis of this memo this to me should be a crux of the attack on his
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:08.520]  credibility he has no credibility he is a political animal who has without any
[3:41:08.520 --> 3:41:15.440]  question politicized the FBI speaking of the FBI we have a new director Christopher
[3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:23.840]  Ray close associate of former current New Jersey Governor Chris Christie I had
[3:41:23.840 --> 3:41:28.040]  hoped the president would pick somebody who is outside the political system
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:33.080]  someone who is not inherently political frankly his ties to Christie are
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:38.320]  troubling Christie is among those drug warriors who want Jeff Sessions to step
[3:41:38.320 --> 3:41:43.160]  up his attack on marijuana instead of attacking the Democratic Party for the
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:48.000]  surveillance and violation of the Constitution when it comes to spying on
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:54.200]  Americans or those who have leaked in the furtherance of the phony Russian
[3:41:54.200 --> 3:42:01.440]  collusion claim meanwhile the NSA announces that they've doubled down in
[3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:06.680]  their efforts to find some link between Donald Trump and the Russians what does
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:11.760]  that tell me it tells me that they have nothing you notice that the
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:17.280]  conversation shifted between Russian assistance for Donald Trump before the
[3:42:17.280 --> 3:42:23.760]  election and whether Jared Kushner the president son-in-law had a back channel
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:29.760]  to the Russians after the election such a back channel would of course be
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:36.120]  perfectly legal Barack Obama had a back channel to Iran Richard Nixon had a back
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:40.840]  channel to China by that we mean not going through the Central Intelligence
[3:42:40.840 --> 3:42:45.600]  Agency not going through the State Department it's completely reasonable
[3:42:45.600 --> 3:42:49.720]  that the president would have a concern that any dialogue with the Russians
[3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:54.520]  through the bureaucrats and neocons inside his government would result in
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:43:00.960]  leaks the president has the right to conduct foreign policy as he sees fit
[3:43:00.960 --> 3:43:06.160]  I've been a critic of Jared Kushner but to hang him to declare him guilty on the
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:12.640]  basis of conversations after the election with the Russian government well
[3:43:12.640 --> 3:43:18.720]  that would just be wrong Mr. Kushner should have his day in court as should
[3:43:18.720 --> 3:43:25.920]  General Flynn but so far even Diane Feinstein and that ubiquitous tower of
[3:43:25.920 --> 3:43:38.040]  mush the the the ambitious whining Adam Schiff of California who is I think at
[3:43:38.040 --> 3:43:42.840]  this post most people realize that in Washington DC the most dangerous place
[3:43:42.840 --> 3:43:48.280]  to be is between Congressman Adam Schiff and a television camera he has
[3:43:48.280 --> 3:43:54.200]  consistently claimed evidence of Russian collusion only to admit on April
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:44:00.160]  2nd that he's seen no such proof he has lied repeatedly about my relationship
[3:44:00.160 --> 3:44:06.440]  with goose for 2.0 not a Russian asset and an exchange that's now entirely
[3:44:06.440 --> 3:44:15.520]  public and meaningless and my my contacts indirectly to WikiLeaks and Julian
[3:44:15.520 --> 3:44:22.880]  Assange Assange is a journalist he gets information from sources and he
[3:44:22.880 --> 3:44:27.960]  publishes it some argue that he's committed a crime because he in some
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:33.480]  cases has published information which has been perloined and sent to him
[3:44:33.480 --> 3:44:39.960]  perhaps these people should study the Pentagon Papers case documents were
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:45.320]  stolen from the Nixon administration that documented the origins of the
[3:44:45.320 --> 3:44:51.680]  Vietnam War they were published by the New York Times thus the New York Times
[3:44:51.680 --> 3:44:58.240]  published stolen material for the benefit of the people and in the interests
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:04.200]  of a free press the courts held that the publication of the New York Times of
[3:45:04.200 --> 3:45:09.600]  this information could not be blocked what's the difference between WikiLeaks
[3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:14.480]  and the New York Times or the Washington Post or the record of Bergen or any
[3:45:14.480 --> 3:45:22.760]  other newspaper in the country it is a slippery slope when we begin to prosecute
[3:45:22.760 --> 3:45:29.440]  or threaten journalists and demand that they reveal their sources this entire
[3:45:29.440 --> 3:45:38.960]  attack has been a fabrication of mr. Schiff and senator Warner and John
[3:45:38.960 --> 3:45:44.960]  McCain meanwhile John McCain may have some answering of his own to do he met
[3:45:44.960 --> 3:45:54.240]  with Derek he met with Oleg Derapaska at oligarch close to Putin he was
[3:45:54.240 --> 3:46:00.560]  specifically warned contacted and warned by the intelligence agencies that that
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:07.280]  Derapaska was an associate of Putin and was working for the furtherment of the
[3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:14.680]  Russian state senator McCain chose to meet anyway with mr. Derapaska I would
[3:46:14.680 --> 3:46:21.160]  like to know what the senator discussed I would like to know if senator McCain
[3:46:21.160 --> 3:46:27.880]  solicited mr. Derapaska for multi-million dollar contributions for the
[3:46:27.880 --> 3:46:34.080]  International Republican Institute a front group controlled by senator John
[3:46:34.080 --> 3:46:42.000]  McCain I'd also like to know why key staffers at the Institute would later be
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:49.440]  identified as Soviet moles and would ultimately be discharged despite the fact
[3:46:49.440 --> 3:46:56.440]  that they were hired by John McCain so I'd say that senator McCain has some
[3:46:56.440 --> 3:47:03.040]  answering to do on his own he famously said on television Roger Stone should
[3:47:03.040 --> 3:47:08.560]  come before the Congress and explain his ties to the Kremlin and to mr. Yana
[3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:14.840]  Kovic referring to the former Ukrainian president let me break this down for you
[3:47:14.840 --> 3:47:21.320]  senator I have no contact whatsoever with the Kremlin with the Russian state
[3:47:21.320 --> 3:47:29.040]  with Putin's Gulag I did not work for mr. Yana Kovic I worked in one election
[3:47:29.040 --> 3:47:36.880]  cycle against him for a pro-western candidate now this is a good time as
[3:47:36.880 --> 3:47:43.800]  any to remind you that we at info wars are under siege from the tech left who
[3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:50.320]  seek to cut us off at the knees and this is the best reason I can think of to
[3:47:50.320 --> 3:47:56.920]  support the info wars comm store I particularly like this new z-shell
[3:47:56.920 --> 3:48:03.200]  toxic metal and chemical defense support formula quite simply because there are
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:07.960]  countless studies that show our food our water our air is loaded with toxic
[3:48:07.960 --> 3:48:12.960]  metals and chemicals that are weakening our immune systems and playing havoc
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:18.280]  with our long-term health even the EPA has admitted over 800 million pounds of
[3:48:18.280 --> 3:48:23.640]  pesticide are dumped in the US every year and 80% of these pesticides are used
[3:48:23.640 --> 3:48:30.200]  on crops it's virtually impossible to avoid all of these metals and chemicals
[3:48:30.200 --> 3:48:36.480]  which are really poisons thanks to info wars a team of doctors and PhD
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:40.480]  herbalists and chemists spent years testing and developing a proprietary
