[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.800 --> 00:21.200]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex
[00:21.200 --> 00:30.360]  jones welcome to the alex jones show on this Monday November 24th 2014 I'm
[00:30.360 --> 00:33.320]  David Knight I'll be your host today we're gonna be joining the second hour
[00:33.320 --> 00:36.560]  with Paul Joseph Watson and in the third hour we're going to go to our
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.400]  reporters in Ferguson Missouri Jigari Jackson and Joe Biggs now they've been
[00:40.400 --> 00:45.440]  there all last week waiting for the grand jury verdict to see what's going to
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.280]  happen it's been taking quite a while and of course tension is building more
[00:50.280 --> 00:55.640]  every day as people are getting angrier and angry as one person put it getting
[00:55.640 --> 01:00.360]  angrier about the delay and this we're going to talk about why it's taking so
[01:00.360 --> 01:04.880]  long and why is what is a grand jury what is their responsibility how are
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.240]  they different from a regular jury we've seen some people say that they didn't
[01:09.240 --> 01:12.520]  even believe that a grand jury was the appropriate response to this there are
[01:12.520 --> 01:17.840]  other ways to do this in many states there aren't even grand juries in
[01:17.840 --> 01:20.640]  the United States so there's a lot of different ways that you can get an
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.000]  indictment of course a prosecutor himself can do it there's not really even
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.120]  though this is a grand jury the grand just really reflects the number of
[01:29.120 --> 01:34.160]  people on the jury there's typically not a judge and control the process there's
[01:34.160 --> 01:38.800]  a prosecutor in control the process and so he's going to kind of present
[01:38.800 --> 01:42.880]  evidence to try to get what he wants to do whether that is a prosecution or
[01:42.880 --> 01:46.680]  letting the person off there are a lot of people who wish that this would go to a
[01:46.680 --> 01:51.680]  trial so everything could be examined there but we're also going to be talking
[01:51.680 --> 01:54.960]  about what's breaking in the news let me give you some of the stories on
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.880]  info wars.com the breaking news there we have a court ruling that a violent raid
[01:59.880 --> 02:03.320]  against homeschoolers was unconstitutional we're going to talk
[02:03.320 --> 02:08.160]  about this in a lot of detail because this is really an egregious situation the
[02:08.160 --> 02:12.760]  child protective services and the police essentially after harassing this
[02:12.760 --> 02:17.440]  family for quite some time basically we're told you're not going to come in
[02:17.440 --> 02:21.160]  the house again unless you've got a court order and they were coming after
[02:21.160 --> 02:25.600]  them for quote a messy house that was the issue that they had with these
[02:25.600 --> 02:29.680]  homeschoolers according to them they did not have a search warrant they came in
[02:29.680 --> 02:33.360]  and got very violent we're going to read you exactly what they did they've been
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.480]  slapped down this is a curtain emmo's article they've been slapped down by the
[02:37.480 --> 02:41.480]  court in that state says that what they did was unconstitutional they are also
[02:41.480 --> 02:44.920]  fighting back with a civil suit so we're going to tell you about that it's
[02:44.920 --> 02:49.160]  interesting to compare that and contrast that with what's going on for
[02:49.160 --> 02:54.280]  example in the UK with members of parliament and Westminster and a pedophile
[02:54.280 --> 02:59.560]  ring 30 years ago of course Scotland Yard and the press were told to cover up
[02:59.560 --> 03:04.040]  any mention of that we've seen that happen with Seville the entertainer that
[03:04.040 --> 03:07.420]  was there as well but it's not just there of course we've had our own
[03:07.420 --> 03:11.560]  Franklin cover up our own Franklin scandal in this country this is something
[03:11.560 --> 03:16.880]  that happens at the highest echelons of every government and as the article we
[03:16.880 --> 03:22.000]  have up on info war info wars last week pointed out the higher up you go in
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.840]  governments the more you see this kind of sexual perversion the pedophilia this
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.680]  is why it's very concerning to see them trying to entree themselves into the
[03:32.680 --> 03:37.880]  lives of families using CPS we've also seen how that plays out there's also a
[03:37.880 --> 03:43.520]  report that broke today actually on November 21st the state of Connecticut
[03:43.520 --> 03:52.200]  issued a 114 page report on the shooting at Sandy Hook now they're taking this in
[03:52.200 --> 03:55.760]  a different direction from gun control now they're trying to use this as a
[03:55.760 --> 04:01.200]  pretense to essentially enact the same kind of controls that we've seen enacted
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.280]  in Scotland where you are assigned a government minder from birth until the
[04:06.280 --> 04:10.720]  age of 21 where government psychologists are going to come and intrude
[04:10.720 --> 04:14.400]  themselves into your homes because as they pointed out there are they're
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.840]  concerned about siloed systems of education physical health mental care
[04:19.840 --> 04:23.000]  for children you understand what they're saying when they say siloed
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.080]  they're saying you're isolated you're too isolated we need to be able to come
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.920]  into your home at any time we wish we need to be able to evaluate you and of
[04:31.920 --> 04:35.760]  course there's a lot involved in that we're going to continue with the news
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.720]  and we're also going to have as I said Jacari Jackson and Joe Bates or in
[04:39.720 --> 04:43.920]  Ferguson if we have an early verdict we will let you know immediately what's
[04:43.920 --> 04:59.760]  going on there and what the verdict is stay with us we'll be right back the

[08:08.920 --> 08:13.880]  and the GCN radio network
[08:16.400 --> 08:20.720]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Monday November 24th
[08:20.720 --> 08:25.160]  2014 I'm going to be joined in the second hour with Paul Joseph Watson we're
[08:25.160 --> 08:29.680]  going to talk about the story that's up on InfoWars.com today Democrats have
[08:29.680 --> 08:35.560]  approved reparations for descendants of blacks victimized by 1898 Wilmington
[08:35.560 --> 08:43.280]  race riot let me repeat that 1898 that's like 112 years ago or 116 years
[08:43.280 --> 08:47.680]  old okay in a North Carolina is kind of unique in the sense that it's got more
[08:47.680 --> 08:53.800]  voters on the roll that are over 100 even over 112 than any other state but I
[08:53.800 --> 08:58.280]  don't think there's anybody alive that is really responsible for that in North
[08:58.280 --> 09:01.440]  Carolina but of course the Democrats are trying to do some political
[09:01.440 --> 09:05.680]  grandstanding to appeal to their base that they have just massively betrayed
[09:05.680 --> 09:12.120]  with the immigration amnesty decree by Obama it's going to be the minorities
[09:12.120 --> 09:15.280]  blue collar workers those at the lower end of the income scale that are going
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.160]  to be hurt the most by this massive importation of low-cost workers they're
[09:20.160 --> 09:23.480]  the ones who've been hurt the most by it to start with so we're going to talk to
[09:23.480 --> 09:28.440]  Paul Joseph Watson about that we also have an article that I want to get to
[09:28.440 --> 09:32.720]  about court rules violent raid against homeschoolers as unconstitutional we're
[09:32.720 --> 09:36.240]  gonna talk about that in depth what really happened in this particular raid
[09:36.240 --> 09:41.160]  you will not believe what happened with that also in Ferguson and Jakari Jackson
[09:41.160 --> 09:45.520]  and Joe Biggs are going to be joining us in the third hour from Ferguson perhaps
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.040]  sooner if we have a verdict there they say the police and Ferguson violate
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.520]  court order by arresting journalists that's a story that's up on info wars
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.320]  dot com by Steve Watson a Ferguson mob marches in st. Louis city shuts down a
[09:58.320 --> 10:02.640]  highway and reporters hidden the head we also have the Texas governor-elect
[10:02.640 --> 10:08.080]  plans new lawsuit against Obama he says the president is unconstrained by the
[10:08.080 --> 10:11.800]  Constitution that's Greg Abbott he's been the attorney general he has sued
[10:11.800 --> 10:16.840]  Obama over 30 times already as attorney general in Texas he is the governor
[10:16.840 --> 10:20.680]  elect he was on one of the news programs yesterday we're gonna have some
[10:20.680 --> 10:25.320]  clips from that later on in the show it's like a narcotic addiction that he
[10:25.320 --> 10:30.080]  says Obama caps off amnesty immigration week by hitting the links in Las Vegas
[10:30.080 --> 10:34.720]  going golfing yet again and of course no surprise here Mexico and Central America
[10:34.720 --> 10:40.760]  thank Obama for his amnesty decree as we've seen this before and of course
[10:40.760 --> 10:46.120]  even though the Mexican government the Mexican president does everything he
[10:46.120 --> 10:50.480]  can to educate people in Mexico about how to game our system and get on the
[10:50.480 --> 10:54.800]  welfare roles how to come in here illegally he assists people to traverse
[10:54.800 --> 10:59.280]  across his country if they're coming from points south but of course no one is
[10:59.280 --> 11:05.160]  allowed to become an illegal immigrant in Mexico the same rules do not apply
[11:05.160 --> 11:11.200]  there but of course it's only real justice if it's done here not in Mexico
[11:11.200 --> 11:16.600]  and an article from Paul Craig Roberts about what's going on continually in the
[11:16.600 --> 11:20.600]  Ukraine opening the gates to World War three of course we just had Paul Craig
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.560]  Roberts on at the end of last week this interesting story too as we're going down
[11:24.560 --> 11:31.000]  the news here out of the UK liberals are calling now for knife control after
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.200]  getting all the guns from everybody in the UK they've noticed that hey now
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.000]  people are being killed with knives and of course they get all the knives it
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.640]  will be hammers or whatever they have a new motto they say save a life surrender
[11:45.640 --> 11:51.360]  your knife in other words you're the dangerous person evidently you are a
[11:51.360 --> 11:55.800]  potential killer and as this person who had the article here this is a eagle
[11:55.800 --> 12:00.240]  rising dot com pointed that's out he says why not go to the local prison and
[12:00.240 --> 12:04.600]  see how well knife control works that's right you go into a prison and they make
[12:04.600 --> 12:10.240]  their own knives they shiv so I guess maybe we could have another slogan when
[12:10.240 --> 12:15.200]  you go to prison want to live make a shiv you know you have to have a way to
[12:15.200 --> 12:20.360]  protect yourself and that's really the issue you're always going to have violent
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.320]  criminal people the question is how do you protect yourself that's the issue
[12:25.320 --> 12:30.000]  about guns about firearms about the right of a human being to protect
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.560]  yourself you know we talked last week to the 90 year old individual who's gone
[12:35.560 --> 12:39.920]  up against the police multiple times or to feed the homeless I really really
[12:39.920 --> 12:43.960]  appreciate what he's done there but in the course of the conversation he came
[12:43.960 --> 12:47.640]  out you know it came out that he was a former police commissioner and he says
[12:47.640 --> 12:51.240]  you know we got to get over and he started going off on self-defense
[12:51.240 --> 12:55.600]  because I guess of the Trayvon Martin situation but you know that's just it
[12:55.600 --> 13:01.160]  self-defense is self-defense you have a jury decide if somebody acted in
[13:01.160 --> 13:05.280]  legitimate self-defense or if they were the aggressor we have to be able to make
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.480]  that determination not just say nobody is going to have the means to defend
[13:09.480 --> 13:16.360]  themselves so you know that's that's a situation that needs to be decided on a
[13:16.360 --> 13:21.480]  case-by-case basis and of course that's what's happening now in the grand jury
[13:21.480 --> 13:26.280]  investigation in Ferguson and we're going to be talking to Jakari Jackson and
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.280]  Joe Biggs later in the program and we're also going to talk about what a
[13:31.280 --> 13:34.360]  grand jury is why they're using the grand jury and we're going to talk about
[13:34.360 --> 13:38.480]  some of the issues there as well as the epidemic of police violence but right
[13:38.480 --> 13:43.120]  now I want to go to this story that again it's a story up on info wars.com
[13:43.120 --> 13:46.840]  right now it's a top story at the site court rules violent raid against home
[13:46.840 --> 13:51.360]  schoolers is unconstitutional the family was tased assaulted and pepper sprayed
[13:51.360 --> 13:57.880]  but not only did they win this state court saying that the action of the SWAT
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.600]  team and CPS was unconstitutional no they are now going on the offensive they
[14:02.600 --> 14:07.800]  are suing this jurisdiction and let me read you from an article here the DC
[14:07.800 --> 14:11.960]  clothesline goes through it and lays down exactly what happened in this
[14:11.960 --> 14:16.400]  encounter and of course it was just last week that they filed a lawsuit looks
[14:16.400 --> 14:21.520]  like they may win this lawsuit if the court slapped down these police and
[14:21.520 --> 14:26.720]  CPS for what they did very critical of what they did but let me read to you
[14:26.720 --> 14:32.720]  first what it was that they did the agents were sent to the home CPS agents
[14:32.720 --> 14:36.600]  because these people were homeschooling their children and reportedly had a
[14:36.600 --> 14:43.120]  quote messy house they had a messy house so they get a visitation from CPS the
[14:43.120 --> 14:47.360]  family had been harassed by CPS agents on multiple occasions and on this
[14:47.360 --> 14:51.360]  particular day they refused to let the agents inside the home the father said
[14:51.360 --> 14:54.640]  they were not allowed to enter the property without a court order
[14:54.640 --> 14:59.340]  nevertheless one of the sheriff's deputies responded by forcing his way
[14:59.340 --> 15:04.160]  into the home and spraying the father and mother in the face with pepper spray
[15:04.160 --> 15:09.200]  next he uses taser on the father shooting him in the back with a weapon
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.120]  horrified the mother shut the door to separate herself and her husband from
[15:13.120 --> 15:17.920]  the officer who then triggered the taser three more times through the closed
[15:17.920 --> 15:22.880]  door as the barbs are still stuck inside the husband then the second officer
[15:22.880 --> 15:28.960]  helped the first officer who's tasered these people force open the door found
[15:28.960 --> 15:33.440]  both the couple lying on the floor in pain the officers then pepper sprayed
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.200]  the couple as they laid on the floor with a couple subdued the officers then
[15:38.200 --> 15:42.680]  turned to the family dog there we go puppy puppy side they didn't shoot it
[15:42.680 --> 15:45.680]  however they just sprayed it with a chemical agent then threatened to shoot
[15:45.680 --> 15:49.840]  it if it did not stop barking at the end of the raid the couple was arrested
[15:49.840 --> 15:54.200]  both of them were charged with resisting arrest and child endangerment they
[15:54.200 --> 15:58.400]  then took their children away from them for quite some time now let me read you
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.840]  that's the basis of the lawsuit let me read you what the court in Missouri said
[16:02.840 --> 16:08.640]  again this is in Missouri like Ferguson but this is not a Missouri issue this is
[16:08.640 --> 16:13.680]  a national issue and this is not a black thing these people I don't believe I
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.000]  don't know if they were black but I don't think they were black this is a blue
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.280]  thing this is the police not under control with rules of engagement not
[16:22.280 --> 16:26.360]  following the law and that's what a court said in Missouri a court in Missouri
[16:26.360 --> 16:31.920]  has ruled a rage state a raid stage against a homeschooling family in 2011
[16:31.920 --> 16:36.080]  violated the constitutional rights and curtain ammo points out in this article
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.800]  NFO wars.com that they lost custody their children for months after this raid the
[16:40.800 --> 16:45.480]  children were traumatized by witnessing the police assault on their parents the
[16:45.480 --> 16:50.240]  court has now ruled the raid was unconstitutional here's the quote the
[16:50.240 --> 16:53.760]  quote from the court they said the court will not allow an exception to
[16:53.760 --> 16:58.200]  sanction warrantless entry into a private residence by pepper spray and
[16:58.200 --> 17:03.320]  taser if the officer had a warrant in hand and such force was necessary that's
[17:03.320 --> 17:08.320]  a different story but those are not the facts of this case and unfortunately
[17:08.320 --> 17:13.320]  they are not the facts of many many many cases they go on to write the fourth
[17:13.320 --> 17:17.760]  amendment strikes a carefully crafted balance between a family's right to
[17:17.760 --> 17:22.120]  privacy and the government's need to enforce the law now they were defended
[17:22.120 --> 17:25.280]  by the homeschool legal defense association if you are homeschooling
[17:25.280 --> 17:28.880]  and you do not have contact with the homeschool legal defense association you
[17:28.880 --> 17:33.600]  need to support them they are a very useful advocate if you ever come into a
[17:33.600 --> 17:36.840]  situation like this they went on to say the rule applies to all government
[17:36.840 --> 17:40.520]  agents the homeschool legal defense association says court after court has
[17:40.520 --> 17:45.120]  agreed there is no social services exception to the fourth amendment and
[17:45.120 --> 17:49.600]  they also cited a law professor at Duke University who wrote a treatise
[17:49.600 --> 17:54.600]  storming the castle to save the children the ironic cost of child welfare
[17:54.600 --> 17:58.760]  exception to the fourth amendment she said violent police raids can shatter
[17:58.760 --> 18:02.880]  the innocence of even the youngest of children causing a broad range of
[18:02.880 --> 18:08.320]  emotional responses including trauma anxiety fear shame guilt stigmatization
[18:08.320 --> 18:14.960]  powerlessness self-doubt depression and isolation you know it we've seen this
[18:14.960 --> 18:19.480]  happen we talked about this last week as I said this is not a black thing this is
[18:19.480 --> 18:25.120]  a blue thing we need to get control of law enforcement and again this kind of
[18:25.120 --> 18:30.640]  action we've seen sanctioned and approved over and over again because of the
[18:30.640 --> 18:35.160]  explosion of SWAT team raids as we talked about last week in Frank Serpico's
[18:35.160 --> 18:40.120]  op-ed piece that he wrote for Politico last month he pointed out that in his
[18:40.120 --> 18:45.000]  day the real issue was corruption within the police force now it is an epidemic
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.760]  of violence within the police force and I would suggest that both of those
[18:49.760 --> 18:56.160]  things both of those things have come from drug prohibition we've had many
[18:56.160 --> 19:02.440]  times James Guiroch from the police and prosecutors who are against prohibition
[19:02.440 --> 19:06.080]  leap it's the law enforcement against prohibition is actually the the
[19:06.080 --> 19:10.120]  organization we've had him on many times talking about how prohibition
[19:10.120 --> 19:14.240]  corrupts and we've all seen it with the movies with the newsreels with the
[19:14.240 --> 19:19.360]  documentaries about alcohol prohibition we know how that created a black market
[19:19.360 --> 19:24.320]  monopoly for organized crime how it corrupted law enforcement and government
[19:24.320 --> 19:28.200]  we have seen the same thing happen in our country with drug prohibition the
[19:28.200 --> 19:32.360]  differences that drug prohibition has been allowed to run its course now for
[19:32.360 --> 19:37.160]  multiple decades and it's this kind of violence that is now being directed
[19:37.160 --> 19:41.960]  against many of the people who would never have thought about drugs but would
[19:41.960 --> 19:46.120]  have approved this kind of violent reaction from the government to try to
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.000]  interdict drugs we need to understand that the solution to everything is not
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.120]  government and it's not government violence we'll be right back we're
[19:53.120 --> 19:56.600]  gonna cover Ferguson we're going to have our reporters in Ferguson and we're

[24:49.600 --> 24:54.560]  we've seen CISPA and SOPA Acta Pippa many different legislative approaches that
[24:54.560 --> 24:59.720]  have been put forward and have been rejected because of the people getting
[24:59.720 --> 25:04.840]  involved and the population saying we don't want our internet content

[25:14.880 --> 25:18.280]  the back door just as Obama said could not get his agenda through
[25:18.280 --> 25:22.280]  legislatively so he just does it by decree they're also going to do internet

[26:26.480 --> 26:30.920]  before the break we were talking about this particularly egregious case although
[26:30.920 --> 26:35.680]  you know it's not isolated unfortunately we see SWAT team raids coming in
[26:35.680 --> 26:41.140]  throwing flashbang grenades into the cribs of children because they're not they
[26:41.140 --> 26:45.760]  haven't done their research their due diligence many cases we see SWAT team
[26:45.760 --> 26:51.680]  raids being conducted that have not gotten the proper paperwork but even if
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.320]  they have the proper paperwork do we really want to have these no-knock
[26:55.320 --> 27:00.520]  raids do we really want to allow officers to go to a home where a family
[27:00.520 --> 27:05.240]  has been accused of having a messy house do we really want them to go and harass
[27:05.240 --> 27:08.480]  people and then when they're told get a search warrant if you want to come back
[27:08.480 --> 27:12.800]  and harass me again they bust through the door they taser the mother and father
[27:12.800 --> 27:16.800]  they pepper spray the mother and father they pepper spray the dog threatened to
[27:16.800 --> 27:22.720]  shoot the dog do we really want to live in that kind of a country see it's not
[27:22.720 --> 27:26.320]  just black people it's not just homeschoolers you could be walking down
[27:26.320 --> 27:29.960]  the street and somebody or you could be in a store and somebody could finger you
[27:29.960 --> 27:37.880]  there's a of course a movement now in the case that was in Ohio in the Walmart
[27:37.880 --> 27:44.400]  I believe it was in Ohio the fellow who was let's see I'm looking at the newsletter
[27:44.400 --> 27:49.000]  here nevertheless it's the core is story yes Ohio the story where if you remember
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.680]  back in August we covered it here at info wars.com the man who was going
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.840]  through Walmart he was shopping for gifts he'd picked up a toy BB gun he was on
[27:59.840 --> 28:05.120]  the phone with his wife talking to her and she hears the incident happen
[28:05.120 --> 28:11.160]  somebody in the store had called 911 and said there's a man threatening people
[28:11.160 --> 28:16.200]  with a gun now subsequent video footage showed that was absolutely a lie
[28:16.200 --> 28:21.680]  nevertheless the police showed up shot him dead the wife who's listening to the
[28:21.680 --> 28:27.200]  phone call hears the police say get down on the ground and shots go out and then
[28:27.200 --> 28:30.240]  he's down on the ground because they didn't wait for him to even comply so
[28:30.240 --> 28:35.040]  we look at that happening in a Walmart when we look at that happening to these
[28:35.040 --> 28:40.240]  homeschoolers we look at a lot of these different things that are happening on a
[28:40.240 --> 28:46.040]  daily basis we see in Utah the killings by the Utah police are outpacing gang
[28:46.040 --> 28:52.640]  drug child abuse homicides in this article from the Salt Lake City Tribune
[28:52.640 --> 28:57.480]  they say over the past five years more Utahans have been killed by police than
[28:57.480 --> 29:04.120]  by gang members or by drug dealers or from child abuse so far this year deadly
[29:04.120 --> 29:09.280]  force by the police has claimed more lives 13 including a Saturday shooting
[29:09.280 --> 29:13.520]  in South Jordan they've claimed more lives by the police shootings then has
[29:13.520 --> 29:18.000]  violence between spouses and dating partners as the tally of fatal police
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.200]  shootings rises law enforcement watch dogs say it's time to treat deadly force
[29:22.200 --> 29:27.320]  as a potentially serious public safety problem so we're going to talk about
[29:27.320 --> 29:33.040]  that we're going to cover what's going on with a giant grand jury how is it
[29:33.040 --> 29:36.600]  being used here what is a grand jury how is it different from a regular jury you
[29:36.600 --> 29:41.840]  need to understand what the law is especially what juries do you need to

[33:41.280 --> 33:46.000]  to them when that happens to gauge the reaction of the crowd there they've been
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.560]  covering and live streaming from that area throughout the week and of course
[33:50.560 --> 33:56.520]  earlier in the week we were told that for the most part the police were much
[33:56.520 --> 34:00.080]  more professional than they have been in the past better trained however there
[34:00.080 --> 34:04.600]  was one incident that Joe Biggs reported where they were telling people not to get
[34:04.600 --> 34:08.440]  into the street they would be arrested if they got into the street meanwhile
[34:08.440 --> 34:12.040]  there were some police went around behind the crowd and essentially forced
[34:12.040 --> 34:16.360]  them to the street I don't know if that was the case or that was tied to this
[34:16.360 --> 34:20.320]  article that's up on info words.com police in Ferguson violate court order by
[34:20.320 --> 34:23.360]  arresting a journalist they arrested him he says he was arrested for
[34:23.360 --> 34:28.680]  exercising his first amendment rights on a public sidewalk they say no he was in
[34:28.680 --> 34:33.760]  the street and they failed to disperse we asked them to leave the street they
[34:33.760 --> 34:38.420]  refused so we arrested him along with a lot of other people however it says in
[34:38.420 --> 34:43.080]  the story we have multiple witnesses immediately came forward disputed the
[34:43.080 --> 34:47.120]  claim that he was in the street they provided photos and videos showing that
[34:47.120 --> 34:52.960]  the reporter in question was merely taking photos from the sidewalk so we're
[34:52.960 --> 34:56.680]  gonna be talking to them in the third hour or earlier and before we go back
[34:56.680 --> 35:00.760]  to the news I wanted to let you know that silver bullet our colloidal silver

[35:13.320 --> 35:17.880]  weeks to get more in these high concentrations are 30 parts per million
[35:17.880 --> 35:23.080]  it's a pure base of deionized water it is free of toxic artificial additives
[35:23.080 --> 35:27.240]  there's never been a more important time to have powerful and clean form of

[35:42.280 --> 35:45.560]  just before the break I said we'd talk a little bit about questions that people
[35:45.560 --> 35:49.920]  have raised about grand juries we've been hearing so much about grand jury what
[35:49.920 --> 35:55.560]  is a grand jury is it some high and exalted jury the grand essentially
[35:55.560 --> 36:00.800]  talks about the number of people who are on the jury it's quite a bit more than
[36:00.800 --> 36:04.760]  just the 12 that you typically have in a jury but people are saying now that
[36:04.760 --> 36:08.720]  perhaps and this is a lawyer for the family of Michael Brown the 18-year-old
[36:08.720 --> 36:14.200]  that was shot by the police they say that the grand jury process is different
[36:14.200 --> 36:18.760]  and they believe that it is being applied unfairly when what they're saying
[36:18.760 --> 36:24.200]  about this they said when you think about it this prosecutor is saying that
[36:24.200 --> 36:27.480]  we're just going to be fair and we're not going to recommend any charges he
[36:27.480 --> 36:32.480]  says that's different than anything this prosecutor has done in the past 28
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.080]  years he's been working with grand juries and he says so are we now going to
[36:37.080 --> 36:40.960]  say that what he did all those years was unfair to all those people and now
[36:40.960 --> 36:45.200]  he's going to start being fair get extra fare with the police give the police
[36:45.200 --> 36:49.640]  extra rights why can't we just have equal justice and then he goes on to make
[36:49.640 --> 36:54.120]  another point of the reason that they're having a grand jury he says there's a
[36:54.120 --> 36:57.680]  lot of high-profile cases he says I've seen them were prosecutors say you know
[36:57.680 --> 37:02.080]  what I'm going to hand this one over to the grand jury I want political cover
[37:02.080 --> 37:06.080]  on this one in other words I don't want to take the responsibility for making
[37:06.080 --> 37:08.440]  the decision as to whether or not we're going to go forward with a
[37:08.440 --> 37:11.880]  prosecution and a trial or not I'm going to punt I'm going to say that it's
[37:11.880 --> 37:15.880]  going to be the grand jury's decision not mine I want them to decide so I'm not
[37:15.880 --> 37:19.720]  the one who takes the heat on this decision they believe that that is the
[37:19.720 --> 37:24.920]  situation that's going on here in this case now that was a an article from ABC
[37:24.920 --> 37:30.160]  News looking at how a grand jury works according to finelaw.com it says while
[37:30.160 --> 37:34.200]  all states have provisions in their laws that allow for grand juries about half of
[37:34.200 --> 37:37.840]  the states don't actually use them because there's other things you can do
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.720]  you can have a preliminary hearing prior to a criminal trial there's a lot of
[37:42.720 --> 37:46.920]  different things they're just looking to see if there's enough evidence strong
[37:46.920 --> 37:50.920]  enough evidence or even a probable cause to do an indictment and typically as
[37:50.920 --> 37:55.080]  people have said you can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich it's
[37:55.080 --> 37:59.400]  something that the prosecutor runs they say unlike a grand jury a preliminary
[37:59.400 --> 38:04.080]  hearing is usually open to the public and involves lawyers and a judge not so
[38:04.080 --> 38:08.360]  with grand juries in other words a grand jury is kind of a closed secretive thing
[38:08.360 --> 38:12.520]  as we've seen there's been no news coming out as to what the grand jury is
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.640]  being told what they're going to do it is something that is a completely closed
[38:17.640 --> 38:23.520]  not a transparent system like a jury trial they say that there's not a judge
[38:23.520 --> 38:28.820]  it's just a lawyer a prosecutor it's not necessary it's not a judge with an
[38:28.820 --> 38:34.400]  adversarial situation here so it's very different than a real jury trial and
[38:34.400 --> 38:39.240]  it's a closed process they say there is no judge present there's no lawyers
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.880]  typically except for the prosecutor so it's basically a captive situation in
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.000]  order to get an indictment they typically need a supermajority two-thirds or
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.600]  three-quarters of the grand jury to indict then in other words they don't
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.600]  need a unanimous decision but they do need a majority to do an indictment
[38:55.600 --> 39:00.640]  they say even though a grand jury may not choose to indict a prosecutor can
[39:00.640 --> 39:03.640]  still bring the defendant to trial if they think they have a strong enough case
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.800]  so they don't even need to have the grand jury indict they can still indict them
[39:08.800 --> 39:14.040]  themselves so I think that underscores the fact that this is really more than
[39:14.040 --> 39:19.720]  anything to provide political cover for this prosecutor who has been operating
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.640]  for 28 years and is now doing this quite a bit differently than he's done in the
[39:24.640 --> 39:28.960]  past they say he's presenting a lot of evidence he's announced that he's going
[39:28.960 --> 39:33.520]  to give them all the evidence that he has the problem is that that's fine the
[39:33.520 --> 39:37.660]  problem is is that it's a closed secretive process you can't hear what
[39:37.660 --> 39:42.820]  the prosecutor is telling them there's no adversary in this process there's no
[39:42.820 --> 39:48.920]  judge who is refereeing between the prosecution and the defense so that's
[39:48.920 --> 39:53.760]  not really I think what needs to be done in order to to bring this down because
[39:53.760 --> 39:58.040]  there's a lot of questions about what happened with this and we need to start
[39:58.040 --> 40:03.200]  asking questions about the rules of engagement as Paul Joseph Watson said
[40:03.200 --> 40:08.800]  when he was on last week they always focus on these cases that are not clear
[40:08.800 --> 40:13.520]  cut because we've heard now when we've heard testimony we even heard it's not
[40:13.520 --> 40:17.080]  just testimony from the police we actually had recordings that surfaced
[40:17.080 --> 40:22.880]  from people who were talking to other people that were observers there talking
[40:22.880 --> 40:28.400]  about how he rushed the police officer nevertheless a jury should be deciding
[40:28.400 --> 40:34.000]  whether or not the response was reasonable or not was it necessary for
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.440]  him to fire that many shots could he have stopped him with one or two should
[40:38.440 --> 40:43.440]  they have called the medical ambulance sooner or not now of course we've seen
[40:43.440 --> 40:48.800]  different narratives as whether or not he got help quickly or not all that needs
[40:48.800 --> 40:54.000]  to be done in the open it needs to be done in an open jury trial with both
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.480]  sides being argued I think that's the only way they're going to pull this down
[40:57.480 --> 41:02.120]  but that's a case where there's a lot of ambiguity as to who's guilty or not I
[41:02.120 --> 41:06.000]  believe it should be done in an open trial but there are many cases just as
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.480]  the one we talked about this weekend where the man the black man was shot in
[41:10.480 --> 41:14.640]  the stairwell by two officers who were doing a patrol on a project basically
[41:14.640 --> 41:18.880]  the man was walking with his longtime girlfriend the two officers enter the
[41:18.880 --> 41:23.360]  stairwell one of them pulls out a gun without warning fires and kills the man
[41:23.360 --> 41:28.640]  with one shot in the chest they did not even bother to call an ambulance and the
[41:28.640 --> 41:33.040]  police chief in New York City has said that the man had not committed a crime
[41:33.040 --> 41:37.760]  the man was not armed in other words he said everything except my police
[41:37.760 --> 41:42.440]  officer killed a man he would not make that admission and of course that's
[41:42.440 --> 41:46.240]  something that still has to play out in the courts there should be an
[41:46.240 --> 41:49.960]  investigation of that look at the case that was in Ohio at the Beaver Creek
[41:49.960 --> 41:54.720]  Walmart that we reported on back in August about the Walmart shopper who was
[41:54.720 --> 42:00.280]  shot dead by cops after picking up a BB gun and also an innocent bystander was
[42:00.280 --> 42:04.360]  literally scared to death died of a heart attack after the shooting this is
[42:04.360 --> 42:07.600]  what the man's wife said she said we were just talking he said he was at the
[42:07.600 --> 42:11.120]  video games playing videos and he went over there by the toy section where the
[42:11.120 --> 42:16.440]  toy guns were the next thing I know he said it's not real and the police start
[42:16.440 --> 42:20.840]  shooting and then they said get on the ground but he was already on the ground
[42:20.840 --> 42:26.800]  because they had just shot him dead these are the kind of cases that we need to be
[42:26.800 --> 42:32.400]  rallying behind but instead they choose an ambiguous case that I believe the
[42:32.400 --> 42:36.520]  Obama administration wanted to make into a national case the mainstream media
[42:36.520 --> 42:39.680]  who supports them wanted to make it into a national case because they wanted to
[42:39.680 --> 42:44.880]  play the race card before the election but they certainly should get behind
[42:44.880 --> 42:49.800]  these unambiguous cases use it to talk about how we set the rules of
[42:49.800 --> 42:53.000]  engagement for the police what the penalties are going to be when they
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.880]  don't follow those rules of engagement let's let's ask them you know if is it
[42:57.880 --> 43:02.760]  okay for the police to shoot you if you attack them without a weapon what about
[43:02.760 --> 43:06.920]  if you're running away without attacking the police can they still shoot you
[43:06.920 --> 43:13.360]  how about if you refuse an order no matter how arbitrary that order can the
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.920]  police still shoot us what if we talk back yell at him shoot a bird at him can
[43:18.920 --> 43:24.000]  they pull out a gun and shoot us what if we give the officer a dirty look what
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  if we're photographing the officer are they allowed to shoot us in all those
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.720]  cases what if we're walking in a stairway with a our arm around a girl are
[43:33.720 --> 43:38.640]  they allowed to shoot us then we need to have these discussions you know and then
[43:38.640 --> 43:41.840]  we need to say can they shoot us until they run out of ammunition how many
[43:41.840 --> 43:45.920]  times did they shoot Frank Serpico said in his day they would take two shots and
[43:45.920 --> 43:49.360]  then reassess the situation now they just empty the gun until they run out of
[43:49.360 --> 43:54.960]  ammunition do they have some additional liability if they don't call for an
[43:54.960 --> 43:59.160]  ambulance if they just let you bleed out on the ground is there going to be
[43:59.160 --> 44:05.120]  criminal liability for people who call 911 as a as a snitch we remember with
[44:05.120 --> 44:08.920]  just this last weekend we had a 12 year old who died again with a BB gun a
[44:08.920 --> 44:15.240]  person called the police and said there was a kid with a gun it was possibly it
[44:15.240 --> 44:19.680]  said multiple times it was probably fake that was not conveyed to the officers
[44:19.680 --> 44:23.320]  on the scene they say by the 9-11 operator nevertheless why would a
[44:23.320 --> 44:27.800]  person call 911 if they think it was probably fake and if they say it
[44:27.800 --> 44:31.480]  multiple times or look at the situation I just mentioned in the Walmart where the
[44:31.480 --> 44:37.280]  man had the BB gun that he was buying in Walmart and he was shot dead by the
[44:37.280 --> 44:42.920]  police it was the person who called the 911 dispatcher is named Ronald Richie
[44:42.920 --> 44:47.240]  and he said that this man whose name is Crawford was pointing the gun at
[44:47.240 --> 44:52.160]  children and then he repeated that claim called it to the press but then they
[44:52.160 --> 44:56.840]  looked at the surveillance video and that wasn't true he wasn't threatening
[44:56.840 --> 45:04.720]  anybody even with a Walmart BB gun so what is the liability for somebody who
[45:04.720 --> 45:11.240]  acts like a snitch who wants to call 911 regardless of what they
[45:11.240 --> 45:15.560]  say you know what what is feeding these people is this this see something say
[45:15.560 --> 45:19.760]  something do they want to be good little informants are going to get a pat on
[45:19.760 --> 45:24.040]  the head from Homeland Security I mean why would somebody do something like
[45:24.040 --> 45:29.440]  this we have some real serious problems in this society and it isn't limited
[45:29.440 --> 45:32.640]  just to the police we have a lot of people who are apathetic we have a lot
[45:32.640 --> 45:37.240]  of people like this guy Ronald Richie who are so eager to call the police we
[45:37.240 --> 45:41.600]  need to talk about this we need to set up some rules and engagement but of
[45:41.600 --> 45:49.120]  course when it comes to Ferguson it is all about race and race only now people
[45:49.120 --> 45:53.400]  are doing something about this in the Ohio situation the man who was shot in
[45:53.400 --> 45:59.000]  Walmart anonymous has really taken up this case and we have a picture of this
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.160]  article here from countercurrentnews.com a lot of anonymous protesters now
[46:04.160 --> 46:07.960]  there's been a lot of protests there's been protests from people with Ohio
[46:07.960 --> 46:13.280]  open carry the Ohio Student Association has protest protested many times but
[46:13.280 --> 46:18.200]  they say that each of these times anonymous was there and is getting
[46:18.200 --> 46:22.680]  larger and larger and of course anonymous has also put out I think a
[46:22.680 --> 46:27.320]  pretty good manifesto about what this problem is and laying it out in this
[46:27.320 --> 46:31.520]  particular situation they said it's come to our attention the coal-blooded
[46:31.520 --> 46:35.760]  murder of a 22-year-old John Crawford it due to video evidence released by
[46:35.760 --> 46:41.080]  Walmart we will now begin up John Crawford our demands are simple fire and
[46:41.080 --> 46:46.080]  or disarm officer Sean Williams yes if he's going to continue in the police
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.320]  force let him continue in the police force without a gun that used to be
[46:50.320 --> 46:55.440]  quite common in America it still is done in Alaska where they pride
[46:55.440 --> 46:59.600]  themselves on de-escalating situations and talking to people rather than
[46:59.600 --> 47:05.400]  shooting people they say if he's going to remain disarm him bring criminal
[47:05.400 --> 47:09.920]  charges against 911 caller Ronald Ritchie who essentially started this and
[47:09.920 --> 47:15.600]  got the guy killed publicly apologize to John Crawford's family these demands
[47:15.600 --> 47:19.160]  must be met or we will take steps to ensure justice will be served we have
[47:19.160 --> 47:22.520]  already taken down Beaver Creek's main site for hosting information about the
[47:22.520 --> 47:26.680]  police we will leak any and all information about all police officers of
[47:26.680 --> 47:30.600]  Beaver Creek and government officials a message to the Beaver Creek government
[47:30.600 --> 47:36.360]  you have caused this by your ignorance and not responding to the murder of an
[47:36.360 --> 47:41.920]  innocent man we will target any and all sites that you support now that's
[47:41.920 --> 47:46.000]  anonymous's way of dealing with it we need to have other people get involved
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.440]  as well there are other things that can be done other than targeting their
[47:49.440 --> 47:53.840]  internet sites we need to have community leaders who are going to stand up to
[47:53.840 --> 47:58.040]  Obama's decrees they're going to stand up to the police who are going over their
[47:58.040 --> 48:01.800]  rules of engagement you know we talked about these homeschoolers who were
[48:01.800 --> 48:07.880]  basically one in a court in Missouri that ruled that their constitutional rights
[48:07.880 --> 48:11.680]  were violated now they are suing that area you know the problem is they're
[48:11.680 --> 48:15.920]  going to sue that police force they're going to sue that municipality and guess
[48:15.920 --> 48:20.840]  who's going to pay for it it's going to be the taxpayers of course and in a
[48:20.840 --> 48:24.440]  sense I guess they are responsible if they don't reform their government if
[48:24.440 --> 48:29.000]  we are going to set by and apathetically allow this to happen again and again
[48:29.000 --> 48:33.400]  without any reformation I guess we should be hit with multi-million dollar
[48:33.400 --> 48:37.680]  compensation lawsuits I believe that one of the things that needs to be done to
[48:37.680 --> 48:43.000]  get this in control is to take that money out of the police department make
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.760]  individuals liable if they're good if they're found guilty of criminal action
[48:47.760 --> 48:52.120]  they should not be able to hide behind a uniform we need to treat them the same
[48:52.120 --> 48:56.160]  way that we treat other people so there's a lot of different places where
[48:56.160 --> 49:01.840]  we could be making these kinds of important reforms but instead they push
[49:01.840 --> 49:07.640]  us into a racist narrative and we're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson
[49:07.640 --> 49:13.320]  he has a article that's up on info wars.com today Democrats in North Carolina
[49:13.320 --> 49:19.640]  have approved reparations for descendants of black victims from the 1898
[49:19.640 --> 49:27.600]  Wilmington race riot that's 1898 116 years ago there is nobody alive but of
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.440]  course that is merely pandering to the base trying to tell them that even though
[49:31.440 --> 49:35.480]  they just stuck the knife in their back and twisted it with this amnesty decree
[49:35.480 --> 49:39.680]  stuck the knife in the back minorities blue collar workers low-wage low-wage
[49:39.680 --> 49:45.560]  job people the backbone of the Democrat Party even though they have been betrayed
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.720]  by Obama they want to show they still care about them by trying to get them
[49:49.720 --> 49:53.560]  money from a 116 year old incident so we're gonna talk to Paul Joseph Watson
[49:53.560 --> 49:57.680]  about that and I want to talk to him also about this scandal that is
[49:57.680 --> 50:04.360]  continuing to unfold in the UK MPs in Westminster part of a pedophile ring
[50:04.360 --> 50:09.480]  were untouchable claims a former special branch officer they say there was
[50:09.480 --> 50:13.480]  significant pedophile groups in Parliament who were untouchable to the
[50:13.480 --> 50:16.960]  police this is something that happened 30 years ago a former Scotland Yard
[50:16.960 --> 50:20.200]  detective has come forward to tell detectives in the Metropolitan Police
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.760]  Services pedophile unit the Scotland Yard was aware of a group in Parliament
[50:25.760 --> 50:31.120]  who sexually abused children over 30 years ago now as we had had up last
[50:31.120 --> 50:35.880]  week on Info Wars we had an article there from Liberty Blitzkrieg and
[50:35.880 --> 50:39.040]  actually he put a number on that and we're gonna continue talking about this
[50:39.040 --> 50:43.040]  as well as one other thing we're gonna talk to Paul Joseph Watson about and
[50:43.040 --> 50:49.720]  that is the implementation essentially of the Scottish law following people from
[50:49.720 --> 50:53.720]  birth to the age of 21 now they're trying to piggyback that onto the Sandy

[54:14.360 --> 54:18.360]  Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Monday November 24th we were just
[54:18.360 --> 54:24.080]  talking about this breaking scandal in the UK actually it's a 30-year-old scandal
[54:24.080 --> 54:31.000]  the well-connected politicians the MPs and Westminster that's essentially like
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.240]  our Capitol Hill they were untouchable according to a former Scotland Yard
[54:37.240 --> 54:42.060]  detective several have come forward we had this story up last week from Liberty
[54:42.060 --> 54:46.800]  Blitz Creek by Michael Krieger he says I've long written about how the percentage
[54:46.800 --> 54:50.840]  of sociopaths within a group of humans becomes increasingly concentrated the
[54:50.840 --> 54:55.320]  higher you climb within the positions of power in a society with it being chronic
[54:55.320 --> 55:00.680]  amongst those who crave political power the most now he points out in some
[55:00.680 --> 55:06.920]  quotes here he says that the files contained the name of 16 MPs said to be
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.720]  involved and another 40 who are supporting the goals of the pedophile
[55:11.720 --> 55:17.360]  information exchange which sought to reduce the age of consent you understand
[55:17.360 --> 55:22.000]  that remember the North American man-boy love association they actually in
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.320]  England that was in America in England they had what they called the pedophile
[55:26.320 --> 55:33.400]  information exchange pie pie yeah and it turns out that in a story from the
[55:33.400 --> 55:39.560]  Guardian they have gone back and uncovered lobbying by pedophile campaign
[55:39.560 --> 55:44.040]  and at this story from the Guardian they essentially link a civil liberties
[55:44.040 --> 55:48.920]  organization to this pedophile organization they say the members hotline
[55:48.920 --> 55:53.480]  for the pedophile information exchange ring of all places inside the home
[55:53.480 --> 55:58.160]  office that's the and I'm not sure exactly I have to talk to a Paul about
[55:58.160 --> 56:02.400]  what that is if that's the where the home office is exactly which branch of
[56:02.400 --> 56:05.920]  government that is but the phone be picked up by Steven Smith the pedophile
[56:05.920 --> 56:10.480]  and a member of the group who worked in security in Whitehall from where he would
[56:10.480 --> 56:15.640]  tell callers where to go to the next meeting to discuss issues including
[56:15.640 --> 56:22.000]  decriminalizing sex with children as young as four say this is how intricately
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.280]  it was linked this is the Guardian reporting this now they're talking to
[56:26.280 --> 56:31.400]  the lady who provided them cover Harriet Harman she was a labor deputy
[56:31.400 --> 56:38.440]  legal leader back in 1978 to 1982 they have tried to distance themselves from
[56:38.440 --> 56:43.880]  it nevertheless this organization that they were part of the NCCL it's a
[56:43.880 --> 56:48.380]  civil liberties group was tied according to archive documents according to the
[56:48.380 --> 56:52.480]  Guardian's research they say archive documents appear to show how the pedophile
[56:52.480 --> 56:56.360]  group managed to influence policy at the civil liberties group despite being run
[56:56.360 --> 57:01.080]  by people who believed in their right to have sex with young children see a
[57:01.080 --> 57:08.040]  kind of interesting isn't it that we're sold abortion as being a right to
[57:08.040 --> 57:14.880]  privacy by a government that doesn't believe that we have privacy in any area
[57:14.880 --> 57:21.240]  of our lives by a political party that has embraced that lack of privacy in all
[57:21.240 --> 57:26.760]  matters we're not allowed to make decisions about our children's education
[57:26.760 --> 57:31.160]  or in many many decisions about our children's education according these
[57:31.160 --> 57:35.160]  people they want to force everybody into the schools that they control the
[57:35.160 --> 57:39.720]  schools that they run they want to stop homeschooling but yet in the name of
[57:39.720 --> 57:45.560]  privacy you're allowed to kill your child just like in the name of civil
[57:45.560 --> 57:50.880]  liberty you are allowed to have sex with young children according to this
[57:50.880 --> 57:56.080]  civil liberties group in the UK that's how they disguise this stuff now we
[57:56.080 --> 58:02.400]  just had a report that came out of Sandy Hook came out of Connecticut based on
[58:02.400 --> 58:06.160]  the Sandy Hook shootings now they're trying to extend the same kind of
[58:06.160 --> 58:11.560]  control that we've seen extended just this last year in Scotland following
[58:11.560 --> 58:17.280]  people from the age of birth to the age of 21 now the US Department of Health
[58:17.280 --> 58:21.400]  and Human Services and the Department of Education has announced that they have
[58:21.400 --> 58:27.080]  $160 million to spread around this country to make this policy work stay
[58:27.080 --> 58:30.000]  with us after the break we're going to talk about that and we're also going to
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.440]  have Paul Joseph Watson joining us in the next hour to talk about this and the
[58:34.440 --> 58:38.480]  other articles we just went over we'll be right back

[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:27.040]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.800]  Monday November 24th 2014 Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us in the
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.240]  next segment and I'm going to hold off on this Sandy Hook elementary school
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.200]  report of the Office of the Child Advocate where they're trying to extend
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:45.880]  the government into the lives of our children into the lives of our family
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.040]  they're going to use a hundred and sixty million dollars in funding from the
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:53.040]  federal government to make it happen I'm going to read you some of their goals
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.920]  and what their agenda is we're going to talk about that Paul Joseph Watson along
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.600]  with this breaking story in the UK about how the government that is always
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.700]  acting in our children's best interest or acting in the name of national
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:12.720]  security because that was the way they protected the pedophile politicians they
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.440]  said you need to stand down you can't report this in the press this is a
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.720]  matter of national security so they always invoke national security always
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.360]  invoke the welfare of the children when it is really the children in this
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.240]  particular case in the Sandy Hook report they're after our children at an
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.520]  early age they do not want us to have private decisions that we're going to
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.800]  make about our families they want to intrude themselves into our families but
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.400]  let's go through the news in this segment because we have a lot of our
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:47.040]  affiliates are doing a news break at this particular part of the program
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.400]  again on info wars.com we have police in Ferguson violating a court order by
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.400]  arresting a journalist they say that he was in the street nevertheless we see
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.800]  pictures that have surfaced showing that he was filming it on the sidewalk and
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.880]  we have testimony from people who are there we also see a Ferguson mob
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:08.800]  marching in st. Louis city shuts down a highway a reporter is hit in the head we
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.920]  have Paul Paul Craig Roberts story opening the gates to World War two
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:18.280]  sorry World War three of course Paul Craig Roberts was on the show with us at
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.520]  the end of last week he says in this article a Russian Foreign Ministry
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.360]  official condemned Washington's reckless decision to supply weapons to Kiev as a
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.920]  violation of an agreement that would make a political resolution the conflict
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:35.640]  less likely sounds very much like the kind of Nambi Pambi statements we're
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.400]  hearing from the GOP Paul Craig Roberts says this statement is perplexing it
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.760]  implies the Russian government has not yet figured out that Washington has no
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.040]  interest in resolving this conflict Washington's purpose is to use the
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.640]  hapless Ukrainians against Russia the worst the conflict becomes the happier
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.120]  Washington is now of course they understand that I believe certainly
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.240]  Putin does he's making massive overtures to China the direct trade between
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:07.200]  Russia and China circumventing the US petro dollar has increased by eight
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:11.760]  fold in just the last year there are new energy deals that are being struck
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.840]  they are trying to do an end run around the US petro dollar which is
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.880]  essentially the thing that kept the fiat currency from our Federal Reserve
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.840]  from imploding its wealth as they took us off the gold any tying to a gold
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.960]  standard they essentially kind of backed it up with oil now if these

[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.880]  from the petro dollar start dealing directly in their own currencies that
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:45.040]  will not only undermine our currency but greatly undermine our economy we have
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.680]  the Texas governor-elect governor Abbott who was the attorney general plans a
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.920]  new lawsuit against Obama he says the president is unconstrained by the
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.440]  Constitution he went on the Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace they asked
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:02.360]  him he's been attorney general here in Texas why he has sued the president so
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.160]  many times he said because this president more than any other has
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.400]  abdicated his responsibility to uphold and enforce the Constitution we have a
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:13.880]  president who feels completely unrestrained unconstrained by the
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:18.520]  Constitution he says he's had reasonable success I think he has sued them
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:23.280]  somewhere in this article it said over 30 times so he's going to do that yet
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.720]  again clearly I do not agree that a lawsuit against Clinton is the rightful
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.480]  thing for Boehner to do however he has other remedies that he refuses to do
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:40.480]  because it's not in his naked self-interest politically to do that
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.080]  he's going to take some political heat if he impeaches Obama but Obama has done
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:50.360]  many many many things to be impeached for they're going to allow him a free
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.160]  pass because they want the power when they get involved and because it's
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.280]  policies that they agree with we're gonna be right back with Paul Joseph

[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.040]  paul joseph watson from the uk and we have a story that paul just put up on
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:38.680]  the info wars dot com site gooseifer says pennsylvania city to be nuked next
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.000]  year top hacker has archive of unreleased emails from military and
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  intelligence officials paul welcome good to be here david
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.080]  fill us in on what the latest revelation from gooseifer is is this something
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.920]  else from the new york times because they interviewed him in prison about a
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:01.040]  week or two weeks ago and at that time he had talked about possibly a false
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.960]  flag nuclear event in chicago now is this another article that they've gone
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:09.200]  that they've released some additional information that's right yeah it's from
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.960]  the original interview with the romanian hacker gooseifer who is in a romanian
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.760]  prison right now and basically it's some information that was unreleased in the
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:24.200]  first new york times article so the new york times came out and said that he
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:29.560]  gave them a manifesto which was a precondition to do the interview but they
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.760]  didn't reprint any of the information contained in gucifer's manifesto they
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.680]  only referred to the fact that he mentioned the potential for a nuke attack
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:45.080]  in chicago in 2015 now in this second article they also acknowledged that
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.280]  gucifer said there was also a target a plan for a nuclear attack in a
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:55.880]  pennsylvania city also next year and why this matters is because gucifer hacked
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:01.760]  the emails of top military intelligence and political professionals he hacked
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.160]  the emails of the bush family the rocker fella family members of the council on
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:12.200]  foreign relations former clinton aids fbi officials federal reserve officials
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.760]  so he hacked these emails he got this information coal in power as well yeah
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.320]  people remember one if people remember there were those pictures that we had
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.520]  the articles of the timing go back and see them on our archives and info wars
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:30.280]  calm he got pictures of george bush where he was essentially painting his
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:34.320]  feet in the bathtub and things like that so they were intricate emails he
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:39.360]  revealed an extra marital affair with colin powell he had an email that was
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:44.800]  going back and forth between george schultz and colin powell and others
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.280]  saying we need to get henry kissinger to put pressure on tony blair to come to
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.560]  bohemian grove you got to impress upon him that this is really important these
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:57.800]  emails were going back and forth by the guy who is now head of the rupert
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.040]  murdoch news empire so he got into some really deep stuff and they tried to
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.960]  downplay this in the last article I haven't seen this newest one that you're
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.240]  reporting on but in the first article they tried to downplay it and say oh he's
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:14.200]  just trying to put a political spin on this he was really just eavesdropping on
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:19.680]  pretty girls and yet there was a lot of government emails that he infiltrated
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.120]  wasn't there exactly and the big point here is he has he says that he has
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.320]  another treasure trove of emails that he hasn't publicly released many of them
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:34.440]  have been released on krypton.org but in this new new york times article they
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:39.040]  revealed that he's got a bigger archive that is stashed away in the cloud for
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.720]  safekeeping and perhaps for use as a bargaining chip with the American
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:49.440]  authorities so maybe he's using this as a threat to try and lessen his seven-year
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.240]  prison sentence and get out of jail sooner but in this latest article he's
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.240]  now talking about a pennsylvania city and again this isn't just some random
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:03.320]  person on the internet this is somebody who's had direct access to the emails of
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.120]  top military and intelligence professionals so that's why it's at least
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.680]  of interest the new york times didn't find it of any interest they just said
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.480]  it was a conspiracy-laden rant about the Illuminati and he actually had a
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:22.040]  psychological evaluation Gucci for otherwise known as Mr. Lazar and they
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.920]  found that he was completely sane he wasn't prone to delusions or anything
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.120]  like that so you know we're merely taking this and highlighting it and saying
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:36.000]  this is interesting that this top hacker who had access to all these military
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.400]  and intelligence political emails is now saying that Pennsylvania could be a
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.160]  target for a nuclear attack next year after saying that Chicago could also be
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.880]  in the crosshairs and even if it's you know not some kind of staged attack we
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.100]  know the ISIS have put out propaganda where they directly name buildings in
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:59.680]  Chicago that they plan to attack and so this has already been out there
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.440]  previously it sure would be interesting to talk to this guy before he gets
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.960]  killed by these people because he talked about and they were laughing about it in
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.240]  the New York Times talked about the Illuminati and these elite people who
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.440]  are manipulating things and yet you look at the emails going back and forth
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:21.320]  about Bohemian Grove and you look at this guy Andrew Knight who is at the
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:25.040]  time was the number two under Rupert Murdoch now is essentially assumed
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:31.160]  control of the newspapers there somebody who has long ties as the CEO of
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:37.160]  conservative British press organizations and mainstream editor he's there
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:42.520]  trying to get Tony Blair to Bohemian Grove and writing Colin Powell saying
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.600]  you know put pressure on him from Henry Kissinger we need to get him there I
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.080]  mean there is there is something going on that he has seen the inside of it
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.800]  just like Alex Jones saw the inside of it when he snuck in there took the
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.000]  pictures I really would like to get that detailed information from him but
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.280]  he's hopefully he's leveraging this to keep himself safe in prison well yeah
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.360]  the point about Bohemian Grove the email which was sent to Colin Powell
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:15.240]  encouraging Tony Blair to attend Bohemian Grove in 2012 is again demolishes the
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.720]  myth that Bohemian Grove is either just a talking shop or a summer camp right
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.280]  because he's very insistent that Blair go there because obviously it's important
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.000]  in terms of influence networking making connections and coming to major
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  decisions we know that the Manhattan project was crafted at Bohemian Grove
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.240]  so major geopolitical global decisions take place there and these Gucci for
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.840]  hacked emails there another illustration of that yeah he evidently was
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.440]  reluctant to go maybe you know he'd heard of the homosexual reputation of
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:53.360]  the place and they were saying you have to impress upon him how imperative that
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.760]  it is that he clear his calendar and get to this you know this is George
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.200]  Schultz and Colin Powell and Henry Kissinger you know all you guys lean on
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.440]  him to get him there because this is imperative that he get there so this is
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.960]  not just some kind of you know partying weekend this is something where they
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:17.080]  really have to get him involved it is it is not just kind of a relaxing weekend
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.520]  as they like to portray it was there anything else that you wanted to cover
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.960]  from the Goose for a release has the New York Times talked about anything in
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:31.080]  terms of which city it might be or did they mention anything other than a city
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:35.880]  in Pennsylvania possibly being up for a nuclear attack they just mentioned
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.560]  Pennsylvania obviously you would assume that it's Pittsburgh or Philadelphia
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.920]  those as far as I know the two biggest cities in Pennsylvania so I mean we'll
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.480]  we'll keep track of it the other thing on the email that Colin Powell received
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.920]  it said quote lack of exposure suggests that Tony has not yet got his
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:59.280]  priorities straight so they're quite candid this is not just a suggestion to
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:04.480]  invite him to a party this is a very candid and forceful recommendation that
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.640]  Colin Powell put pressure on Tony Blair to attend Bohemian Grove so these
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:12.880]  emails have already proven very interesting and as he said Guccifer has
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.760]  another stash that he's yet to release he's using it as a bargaining chip with
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:22.000]  the US government so we'll continue to track the story well let's go to this
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.040]  other article that you got up on infowars.com today Dems approve
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:32.040]  reparations for descendants of blacks victimized by 1898 Wilmington race riot
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:37.520]  116 year old incident they want to have white-owned businesses they say are
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:43.000]  still profiting from that they want them to pay money to black descendants of
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.680]  the victims talk about that Paul. Yeah I mean I didn't know what this incident was
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:52.800]  until a research this morning but this was an overthrow of the government there
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:59.280]  in North Carolina as he said 116 years ago during which at least dozens up to
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:05.480]  60 black people were killed by white supremacists from the Democratic Party
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:10.640]  over a thousand of them were driven out of the area and Wilmington became a
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.960]  majority white area having previously been a majority black area so this is
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.120]  this is an incident that's you know there's a memorial for it it's a
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:23.800]  historical incident it was a massacre it was a what they call an insurrection
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:31.000]  but now after pressure from one resident in particular in Wilmington the North
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.440]  Carolina Democratic Party introduced this resolution it's not passed it's
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:41.240]  introduced as a resolution but if taken up it will be formed into a bill and
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.200]  introduced to the General Assembly for debate so it could be a piece of
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.640]  legislation soon and as he said it it basically says that black people in
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:55.040]  Wilmington who are descendants of individuals killed during that
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.640]  insurrection should receive compensation or reparations as a result of an
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:07.280]  incident which happened 116 years ago yeah the business owners there now have
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.360]  absolutely nothing to do with whether they're white or black that's obviously
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.140]  the tax payers would be the ones paying for it now this is this is political
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:18.140]  grandstanding by the North Carolina Democrat Party there's absolutely no
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.840]  chance of this is going to get passed through the legislature and it shouldn't
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.800]  get passed through the legislature as you just said this is something that
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:30.000]  nobody alive is responsible for or should have to be taxed for or should
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.920]  have to be I should have to pay for this it's interesting Paul that in North
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.200]  Carolina of course there's been a lot of talk going back to 2012 elections
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.800]  about how many people they have on the voter registration rolls there that
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.320]  over a hundred I mean there's several thousand people that they have over the
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.080]  age of a hundred still on their voter registration rolls because they don't
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.440]  ever purge them which opens the door to fraud and of course they've got a lot of
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:56.480]  112 year olds so I guess maybe they're looking at the voter registration roles
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.320]  and thinking that maybe there are some of these guys still alive but I don't
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.160]  think in reality that's the case I think really Paul what's behind this is that
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.840]  they want to try to show themselves they want to play the race card because they
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:14.160]  really don't have anything else left they've been a total failure in their
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.240]  policies there and they have just betrayed their their base their blue
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:23.280]  collar workers minorities people at the low end of the scale who've always been
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:28.720]  the reliable base of the Democrat Party throughout my lifetime those people
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.960]  have really been betrayed by Obama's amnesty decree and I think they're just
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.600]  trying to trying to get those people back into the fold show them that they
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.440]  still care about them playing the race card we've got to go to commercial break
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:44.960]  Paul but we're gonna be right back with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK stay with

[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:54.120]  at infowarslife.com David Knight. Hey Paul yes I'd want to get your take I talked
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:25:00.080]  about this earlier in the last hour we have this breaking pedophile scandal
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:06.200]  that's in Great Britain involving MPs Westminster and I wanted to get your take
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.920]  on this we talked about it briefly last week and as this gradually unfolds I
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:14.320]  think we're now 30 years away from when this was happening I think people some
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.120]  people have died some people are getting fairly old and they want to kind of
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.280]  clear the air here I think clear their consciousness so now this is starting to
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.080]  come out there was an article that was referenced as part of this reporting
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.760]  going back to February of this year on The Guardian talking about lobbying by
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:33.960]  pedophile campaign a group called the pedophile information exchange they say
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:38.160]  that when people called that hotline for the pedophile information exchange the
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.760]  phone rang inside the home office tell us what the home office is there in the
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:48.840]  UK the home office is basically the the section of government that deals with
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.680]  domestic issues related to corruption and criminal investigations within the
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.160]  United Kingdom as well as immigration matters but this is shocking I mean yeah
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:04.480]  we have stories about MPs in Britain this is back in the 80s and you can bet
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.880]  that some of this is still going on now oh yeah they were they were caught
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:14.400]  basically other MPs reported on them abducting children taking them to these
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:21.320]  houses raping them strangling them and in three cases according to one eyewitness
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:27.320]  they killed these boys so absolutely sickening but the key point about it as
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:32.520]  you just alluded to is the Metropolitan Police who took statements at the time
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.680]  from witnesses who took the information from the other MPs who were reporting
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:41.800]  this said that the group involved in abusing and killing these young boys
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:48.120]  was too powerful to bring to justice and that they couldn't investigate the
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:54.200]  pedophiles in Westminster in government abducting these children sexually
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:59.160]  abusing them and then in some cases killing them then on top of that the
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:04.720]  newspapers the media outlets that were set to report on this back in the 80s
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:11.280]  received denotices from the government which means in the UK an order directly
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:16.200]  from the government not to report on this pedophile scandal because in their
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:21.320]  words it would harm national security yeah and then even information about the
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:26.680]  denotices themselves were ordered destroyed or were destroyed by accident
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:32.920]  by MI5 and MI6 British intelligence so the very information about the denotice
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:37.920]  itself was later destroyed so this is an obvious cover-up a link has now
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.720]  emerged to Jimmy Savile the infamous entertainer and pedophile who abused
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.080]  hundreds of children who himself is firmly tied in with the British
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:50.760]  establishment or was before his death so this only gets more sickening it's the
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:55.960]  Westminster pedophile network which is now being exposed but again every time
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:00.160]  they have an investigation into this the head of it is always part of the
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.720]  establishment and it goes nowhere just as it did back in the 80s when police
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.840]  said that they couldn't investigate the group because it was too powerful to bring
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:12.960]  to justice you're talking about the civil situation they've got pictures of him
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.560]  up here for people who don't know what this guy looks like or who he is of course
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.400]  people here in this country don't know him very well but they shut that down
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:24.040]  three different times higher ups at Scotland Yard shut down investigations
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:28.800]  it surfaced when this I think his case came out what was it year and a half
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:33.960]  two years ago there had been a lot of talk about that a lot of people had
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.640]  mentioned that David Ike had talked about it but it really broke in earnest
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:43.560]  they had the BBC some people the BBC did a documentary about that after he died
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:47.920]  and that was shut down by the people at the top of the BBC so you see the people
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:53.200]  at the top of their media the BBC you see people at the top of Scotland Yard
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:59.200]  shutting it down as people who were lower in the pecking order see this and
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.600]  want to go public with it they're shut down and that's the case that we see
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:06.200]  happening in so many places we've seen that happen in the U.S. and of course
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:12.400]  there's been multiple cases of that have been exposed that have come out and yet
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:18.360]  nothing ever happens in the U.S. or in the UK they never bring these people to
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.080]  justice in Belgium as soon as links emerge to top judges celebrities
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:28.080]  politicians the case got completely shut down in every single country where
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.760]  these elite paedophile networks emerge and it always leads to the elite to
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:37.280]  bankers judges politicians celebrities that are linked in with the
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:41.480]  establishment the case gets shut down every time we're at a time Paul thank

[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.400]  Paul and I were just talking about this breaking pedophile scandal in the UK and
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:15.400]  of course it's happened over and over again in the United States the highest
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:21.240]  levels of government in Belgium with the EU go ahead John in Texas hello
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:27.080]  David hi hi yeah I've been following this you this issue for quite some time
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:32.160]  and I don't know that these people are ever gonna be brought to justice because
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:37.120]  it goes into the royal family as well with this Jimmy Savile character yeah
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:41.880]  he used to procure he used to procure boys for a former Prime Minister Edward
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.600]  Heath in the in the English Channel on the island of Jersey back in the day
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:55.400]  and it's just it's absolutely disgusting you do I there's over a hundred
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:01.200]  thousand children go missing in Britain every year and you never hear about it
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:07.800]  yes yes never in the news that's a substantial amount of missing kids now
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:12.200]  this is Scottish John I recognize your voice I love the the promo that we've
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:18.080]  got I want to get your your take on this you're a good one to talk to about this
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:23.240]  because earlier this year we had the law that was passed in Scotland that was
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:29.800]  going to assign a government minder to children from birth to 18 or 21 now
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:34.320]  we're seeing that being proposed in the United States on the back of the sandy
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:38.640]  hook shooting they're using that to push this through and of course they have a
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.560]  hundred and sixty million dollars in funding from the US Department of Health
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:46.120]  and Human Services and the Department of Education to put this through they're
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:51.440]  very concerned about this they're using the fact that this young man was
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.520]  reportedly homeschooled by his mother so they say we need to be able to penetrate
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:01.280]  the family and have government minders give us your take on what's going on in
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.320]  Scotland and the irony that the government would be doing this for the
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.880]  children when we see at the highest levels of government they've used child
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:16.560]  protective services to abduct children for their own use well I've been aware
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.240]  of it David since it first broke but it's not something I've paid a lot of
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:26.600]  attention to because you know I'm long gone far away so it's no great interest
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:30.280]  to me other than that you know it's just more government intrusion let's be
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:37.080]  honest yeah yeah I mean I'm deeply saddened that the the independence vote was
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:40.920]  lost for Scotland there recently because I think a lot of things were a
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.920]  change then but you know the establishment doesn't you know they
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.680]  don't want this to happen and they're gonna they're gonna use everything at
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:57.120]  the disposal absolutely just maintain the status quo basically yes yes well
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.200]  thank you so much it's good to hear your voices John in Texas I want to go to
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:06.280]  Larry in Illinois but before I do let me read you a little bit about this report
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:11.440]  that came out based on the Sandy Hook school shooting now they said that they're
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:15.960]  concerned about siloed systems of education physical health and mental
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:20.440]  health care for children in other words areas that are private when they talk
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.920]  about it being siloed they say that it's that strongly implicates the need to
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:29.440]  assist parents with understanding and addressing the needs of children with
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.240]  complex development and mental health disorders they say universal and this is
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:38.120]  a report from James F. Tracy we've interviewed him on the show many times
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:41.800]  he did a good job in getting this out and analyzing it so read some of the
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.120]  some of the details from this report they they're calling for universal
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:49.320]  screening for behavioral health and developmental impairment for children
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:55.840]  from ages 21 from from ages birth to 21 they want to assess to training and
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:00.120]  information concerning mental health issues for teachers administrators
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.600]  service personnel pediatricians and parents in other words they're going to
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.440]  train anybody that the child might come in contact with at school or a doctor
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.360]  whatever they want to train them as informants for the government just like
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.680]  we've seen people calling 9-1-1 and getting two people killed recently who
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:24.200]  had nothing but BB guns basically calling into the police and saying in one
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:29.280]  case even saying I think it's probably a toy weapon a fake gun nevertheless the
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:33.440]  police showed up and shot this young man in Walmart is even more egregious the
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.680]  guy who called 9-1-1 kind of hyped it up for the police and they wound up
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.560]  shooting a guy dead without even giving him a chance to put down the BB gun that
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.480]  he was going to buy in Walmart they was walking around the store with so do we
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.400]  really want to have trained professionals who've been trained by
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:56.600]  Homeland Security and Department of Education to finger parents we just had
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:00.920]  a family we talked about the early part of the show they had essentially their
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.280]  house broken into the parents pepper sprayed tasered their children taken
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.120]  away because they were accused of having a messy house is that what we're going
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:11.640]  to see with this let's go on with some of the other things they're going to
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:17.000]  address of course also the quote role of denial and illness so if you think that
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.280]  everything is fine in your home and you don't need intervention from the state
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.640]  maybe you're just in denial and we need to do something about it that's all the
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:28.440]  more reason for us to get involved in your life they want to have a better
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:32.760]  outreach parents who have difficulties quote reaching out so in other words if
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.800]  you're not going to the government for help if you don't have your kids in a
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.000]  government school then you have difficulty reaching out perhaps you feel
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.520]  quote mistrust in the medical and educational systems no doubt I do you
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:52.200]  should if you don't feel mistrust in them why should we trust them explicitly
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.920]  for everything why should we give them carte blanche in our life that was never
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:01.560]  the way this country was founded this country was founded with checks and
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:05.040]  balances because we understand that simply because somebody works for the
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:08.600]  government they don't become an angel they still have the same problems that
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:14.000]  everybody else does if we had angels and we wouldn't need that kind of oversight
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.080]  but we don't we can have good people in government we can have bad people in
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:23.320]  government we need to keep that arms length there they also want state
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:28.920]  consideration of an audit of existing home bound practices and procedures they
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.760]  get very close to say in home school don't they but they say home bound
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.720]  practices and procedures and finally they say this is the summary that we get
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:44.600]  from James Tracy he says in reality the OCA report lays bare the groundwork for
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.880]  implementation of a nationwide program similar to the one presently being beta
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:54.440]  tested in Scotland called getting it right for every child where they are
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:59.800]  going to man where they've mandated an assignment of a named person a government
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:06.080]  minder for every child and young person and a lead professional that renders the
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:11.720]  traditional family role of a distant caretaker understand that this is a
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:18.080]  globalist agenda because we see the same goals the same tactics being used in
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.000]  Scotland that they are now proposing piggybacking this off of the Sandy Hook
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.520]  situation and being funded by a hundred and sixty million dollars from our
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.400]  federal government let's go to a caller here Larry in Illinois would you like to
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:35.560]  you said you want to talk about Ferguson and about the pedophile situation go
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:42.360]  ahead well you know he kind of picked up on my thunder the first caller there and
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:46.560]  you know I'm thinking here when you're talking we're kind of talking these
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:52.080]  subjects to death our own death this country is responsible for a lot of these
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:58.840]  subjects that we talk about worldwide as because money the love of money the
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:03.240]  root of all evil has gotten into the system and if they can't buy people up
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:08.200]  the elect they've done they'll do it through the electronic voting in that
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:16.200]  and us being responsible for this David has got to stop they have mere mundane
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:20.480]  earthly things that they protest in other countries even Russia people will
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:26.520]  get in the public square square and let that the powers that be know that we're
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.520]  not gonna put up with this anymore and we just sit back here and talk to this
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:36.320]  thing all the time and that and it just gets to be the same old thing oh and it's
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:43.200]  also disillusioning to hear people or just see people sit by along with myself
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:47.480]  and if we're not gonna come out of our houses folks I mean it will just gonna
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:52.960]  keep getting worse and I think it's a I think Larry it is a case of education
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:56.200]  it is a case of the Info War and I do believe that people are waking up it's
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:59.720]  frustrating for you it's frustrating for those of us who have been awake for a
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:05.760]  while to look at the people who are still asleep and yet we are seeing signs
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:10.160]  that people are starting to wake up and some people are not being shut down
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.640]  again by just putting this into a racial paradigm we look at the police
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:17.600]  brutality for example in the article that I read earlier about anonymous
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:22.240]  getting involved in the Beaver Creek Walmart in Ohio that's shooting there
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:26.400]  and demanding that some action being to be taken but yeah we do have a very
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:33.240]  passive American public don't we it's part of it I think is basically it's a
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:38.120]  control grid that is what we are fed as far as information and I think there's a
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.880]  component of it that's what we're fed in our food and and water supply it helps
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:48.480]  to pacify us more so than in other countries but putting minders in charge
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:53.040]  of kids from the age of birth to 21 we've got to understand the biggest
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:59.800]  control instrument in my opinion is the government school every tyrant since the
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.920]  time of Plato has understood that you want to get rid of the family you want
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.640]  to directly interpose the government in control of the children and that's the
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:13.680]  way you control the future society Plato's Republic he proposed that no
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:18.200]  one would even know who their parents were they were going to look only to the
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:23.440]  state as their parent and over and over again we see this being replicated by
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:26.520]  degrees by increasing degrees by the Department of Education by the
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:32.040]  centralized federal control where they establish the the traditions that our
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:35.840]  children understand their understanding of history their understanding of how
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.000]  society is to work that is all being controlled and fed to them in a
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  controlled propaganda way that's why it really is an educational issue it really
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.400]  is an info war we have to push back we have to essentially open people's minds
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:53.400]  and re-educate them from the propaganda that they've been fed in school thank
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:46:01.000]  you Larry let's move on to Patricia in Arizona Patricia go ahead hi hi go
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:09.040]  ahead I think that all of this interference in our homes and everything
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:14.440]  is all gonna end up leading back to his bill that he passed to find out how our
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:22.360]  brains work when we're all classified as subhuman you know we all have defects
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:32.440]  we're all handicapped we're all you know something not not mirroring Hitler's
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:39.200]  perfect person you know I didn't we will all be eligible for experimentation to
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:45.520]  find out how our brains yeah there's a real danger of medical tyranny isn't
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:48.880]  there one of the things that really concern me because as we see over and
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.440]  over again people who are troubled whether it's a sometimes it's real
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:57.800]  sometimes many times it's a false flag but in almost all these cases there are
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.680]  SSRI drugs involved there are psychologists who are involved with this
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.320]  and of course they come back and say well we need to and I've even heard many
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:13.240]  many many conservatives say we need to test gun owners for mental sanity or
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:18.600]  mental competence before we do that that is opening up the camel's nose under
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.760]  the tent for the most massive infringement of self-defense that we've
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:28.160]  ever seen they can basically label anybody as being insane and it's as you
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.600]  pointed out is very easy to find some kind of an anomaly with someone there
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:37.080]  are clear cases where people should not be allowed to have guns but we can
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:41.720]  address those individually if they're that dangerous it's not just an issue of
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:45.640]  them having guns they should be locked up if they truly are a dangerous person
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:51.120]  and again that brings up questions about how do we determine if somebody can be
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:55.040]  committed that's something that we need to be very very careful about just as
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:59.040]  just as careful as we should be but aren't in our criminal justice system
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:03.200]  we need to have a lot of protection for people who are accused of being a
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:06.880]  criminal as well as people who are accused of being mentally dangerous or
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:11.600]  incompetent but if they truly are having a weapon is just having access to a gun
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:14.680]  is just one thing a person can do of course they can kill people in any
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:17.720]  number of ways with a hammer with automobiles whatever if they're a
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:21.080]  danger to society they shouldn't be out but before they get locked up we need to
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.840]  be very very careful about that thank you Patricia let's move on to Steven in
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:32.440]  Florida Steven yeah hey good afternoon David I wanted to talk about what is
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:36.200]  this first article you brought up beginning a show about there's a
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:40.760]  homeschooling family in Missouri but I wanted to get into from that a bigger
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:46.520]  picture of something that really hits home with me and it's just so
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:51.880]  deep and a lot of people don't really realize what this involves when you
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:57.720]  talked about this I've had personal experience with CPS a couple of times
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:02.120]  once when we had a child our oldest child woke up in the middle of the night I
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:05.920]  thought he was you know he looked like he was just basically devil possessed but
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:09.440]  he was just having nightmares and I made the mistake of you know trying to wake
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:13.880]  him up smack him on the face I left the bruise me and my pastor took him to
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.520]  hospital and that was a big error because then we got I got interrogated by
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:21.800]  the cops CPS showed up the next day took a Christian water to get them off
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:28.520]  our backs and then in 2003 we had a child die and we had CPS show up the door
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:34.800]  after the people with taxes children reported us for child abuse and medical
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:39.120]  neglect and we had to go through that whole mess and what I wanted to say is
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:44.000]  this there's been a bunch of stuff you guys have reported on and let me preface
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.640]  this have you ever heard of Alfred Kinsey I'm sorry I heard of who Alfred
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:57.440]  Kinsey the Kinsey report yeah yes mm-hmm yes okay and there's a documentary you
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:00.920]  ought to look at and everybody else called Kent the Kinsey syndrome you can
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:06.360]  go to Kinsey syndrome.com it is so eye-opening to see what this man funded
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:10.920]  by the rock of colors without government's knowledge seek single handedly and
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:15.800]  secretly did to undermine our whole jurisprudence system against children he
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:23.360]  took Floyd's postulation that children are sexual from birth and this is why we
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.720]  have so much of this garbage going on today you guys have reported on for
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:30.800]  instance the couple in Connecticut the guy tied with old keepers a couple years
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:35.400]  ago how CPS came in and took their infant daughter away she had evidence of
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:40.680]  child abuse. Oh absolutely and they and they will hide this and say that it is
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:44.000]  part of civil liberties like they did in England where they said they wanted to
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.640]  decriminalize sex with children as young as four the biggest problem with all
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:52.280]  this is that it is so grotesque for the normal person to look at they ignore it

[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:22.640]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this November
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:26.600]  24th 2014 we've been taking callers responses to some of the news that we
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:32.320]  covered earlier about pedophile rings breaking into the homes of home
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:36.680]  schoolers and of course that family has won a victory in the the court in
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:41.160]  Missouri basically shutting down and condemning the actions of the police in
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:44.760]  terms of breaking into their home without a search warrant told at the
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:47.440]  door no you need to get a search warrant to come in here because they'd been
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:51.560]  harassed by the police and CPS nevertheless they tasered pepper
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:56.800]  sprayed the parents took their children away for quite some time they've now had
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:00.800]  a victory from the Missouri court and they are now also suing that police
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:05.760]  department for some compensation to the suffering of that family and of course
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:10.280]  the children witnessed all of that what do we do about this we had a caller
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:14.480]  earlier say it's very discouraging to hear all this news and to see how things
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:18.320]  are moving along and yet there is some good news I think at the local level and
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.360]  I think this is where it's going to have to happen I think that not just with the
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:25.520]  pedophile rings that we see at the highest levels of our government and
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:31.920]  other governments but also with the corruption of the concentration of power
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:36.280]  and money in Washington I don't think it's going to be reformed by sending
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:41.480]  Mr. Smith to Washington and having him stand up and do a filibuster I don't
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:44.200]  think that's going to happen I think it's going to need to be shut down from
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.280]  the outside and there's signs that there are people waking up in state
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:51.960]  legislatures who are willing to do that we have a Texas representative who's
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:57.000]  introduced a bill to nullify all federal gun control regulations that's a Tim
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.840]  Klein Schmidt here in Texas House Bill 176 Second Amendment Preservation Act
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:08.080]  that would say you're not going to use you're not going to take the Second
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:12.520]  Amendment here in Texas we've also got a Utah representative who has introduced
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:16.040]  a bill to cut off water use to the NSA data center now this is something that
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:21.760]  was proposed by some people at the 10th Amendment Center earlier and we've had
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:28.120]  bills introduced locally in California to essentially take away some of the
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:32.280]  utilities that the NSA is using at getting subsidized in their area and of
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:39.200]  course this is the massive data center in Utah the Bluffdale Center where
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.600]  they're using the amount of water and electricity that could run a very small
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:48.560]  city is being used for this data center what are they doing there well they're
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:54.080]  storing everything about everyone indefinitely until they can data mine
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:57:00.160]  it to go after any political enemies that they wish to now just before World
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:05.240]  War two the Dutch government had an idea that they thought it would be a good
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:09.120]  idea to write on to three by five cards information about everybody in their
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:13.200]  country just because I don't know why I don't know why they would do that maybe
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:17.640]  they just like to keep those kinds of records or something like detailed
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:22.080]  records but when the Nazis broke into that country they tried to destroy it
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.760]  but the three by five cards were packed so densely they couldn't get them lit
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:32.000]  to destroy it so what happened well the Nazis got access to that data and they
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.760]  were able to round up and pull out anybody they thought might be a threat to
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:41.480]  them regardless of whether that person was even really a threat but they were
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:46.840]  able to immediately identify and eliminate any political opposition to
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:52.920]  them any kind of opposition to them think about the data center in Utah that
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:58.360]  data is setting there waiting for some tyrant some would-be tyrant somebody
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:03.040]  who has nefarious plans and we know that just because somebody is in
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:07.800]  government doesn't mean that they are angels as I said recently we've just
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:12.000]  seen how they tried to justify a pedophile ring in the name of national
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:18.320]  security that data is setting there waiting for the next tyrant to come in
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:22.720]  and use it against political enemies to shut down any kind of political dissent
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:27.080]  any kind of opposition is waiting there for their corporate sponsors their
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:31.400]  crony capitalist to use against their competitors that's why it needs to be
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:35.120]  shut down besides the fact that it's against the supreme law of the land

[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:36.800]  reporters in Ferguson Missouri Jacare Jackson and Joe Biggs they tell us that
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:41.320]  a grant the grand jury has reached a decision they have they're waiting for
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:44.480]  it to be announced right now so we're going to go to them in the next segment
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:47.680]  but in this segment I want to get right back to your phone calls we got some
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:50.600]  people have been waiting on the line let's go to Anthony in Florida let's
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:53.360]  see how many people we can get through here in a short period of time go ahead
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:59.840]  Anthony hello yes go ahead you're on oh yeah I totally agree with you I just
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:04.480]  like to elaborate that what's going on in Ferguson is definitely there are
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:08.720]  those there's real racism which always be confronted and then there are those
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:13.040]  who stand the flames of racial tension because they have their own selfish
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.640]  interests at heart yes that's true and that's the danger isn't it that that
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:26.960]  real racist get a pass if we try to make phony claims of racism and also too I'd
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:32.440]  like to say that with with these police officers I just recently looked at a
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:38.160]  graph and it really astonished me like if you look at a police officer in the
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:43.480]  1960s he just his uniform was just a basic like a billy glove and you know
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:49.200]  not handcuffed gun and all that and then as it progressed further it looked it
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:54.960]  looked it looked more and more you know you know intimidating and such and the
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:59.200]  fact that they have lowered the standard to the point where they have they let
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:04.720]  these people who obviously have mental problems or sociopaths who will shoot
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:09.160]  first and then ask questions well they actually had a police officer who sued
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:12.640]  it was a police department in the Northeast I can't remember which day
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:15.640]  it was may the guys can look it up you actually sued the department because
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:22.200]  they had a maximum IQ requirement you could not have 100 anything over a
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:26.920]  hundred IQ I think and he sued them they did not want him on the force because
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:31.240]  they said he had too high IQ and the court actually upheld their standards
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:34.480]  that's the most amazing thing about it yeah we've seen a militarization of the
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:38.760]  police we know that's being driven out of the federal government that is their
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:42.480]  agenda they want to militarize the civilian police force and they want to
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:47.320]  use the military as civilian police are trying to conflate and combine those
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:52.720]  two let's go to thank you Anthony let's go to Jacob and Ohio go ahead Jacob
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:59.280]  hello Anthony or David the control of the government is crazy our schools
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:05.320]  right now I mean you have the army workers in there that tried to get
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:10.360]  people to sign up with them and they they just sit there and wait and have
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:16.400]  context to win a free iPad or this and have the kids come up just to register
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:21.280]  and then you then your names in the system basically yeah absolutely I
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:27.160]  could not believe there was an article last week about a school district in
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:32.640]  Pennsylvania essentially giving the school officials the right to strip
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:36.560]  search children in their school and they said the school superintendent when
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:39.880]  questioned about it she said well no they wouldn't do that for drugs I really
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:44.040]  can't imagine a scenario in which they would do it but we need to give that
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:50.360]  power to our police in the schools and I'm like where does it stop where do we
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:54.200]  have any kind of constraint on the police we just give them carte blanche to
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:57.560]  do anything that they want to to our children and I think that's one of the
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:02.000]  reasons why so many people have pulled their children out of the government
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.760]  schools and are homeschooling them thank you Jacob let's go to Jerry in West
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:12.280]  Virginia Jerry go ahead yes I thanks for taking the call David I am mostly
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:17.760]  concerned not to deviate from the subject but we had a big water spell here
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:23.400]  in West Virginia and frankly we've had very little feedback from the government
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:29.000]  and frankly you cannot reach anyone that seems to have some sort of a idea of
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.320]  what seemed to happen and we cannot reach anyone here that can tell us what
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:40.400]  the situation is of course this is the fracking state of the states and we are
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:45.960]  bombarded by chemicals and problems and yet no one seems to be you know holding
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:50.920]  the fort who do we call how can we call these officials and do they really take
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:54.160]  a serious you're going you're going to have to organize outside of them and

[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:45.320]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show this is David Knight and Austin and we are
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:48.960]  being joined right now by our reporters in Ferguson, Missouri, Jakari Jackson and
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:54.760]  Joe Biggs who've been there for the last week awaiting the grand jury decision
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:58.720]  we've now heard that there has been a decision made by the grand jury but of
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:03.240]  course as we pointed out earlier the grand jury is a different situation than
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:08.640]  a courtroom there's usually not a judge there's not an argument from the defense
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:13.800]  attorney instead it's just a prosecutor and a large jury that's what the grand
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:19.680]  means it means that there's more than 12 people maybe two dozen or more so they
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:22.640]  now they have finished their deliberations but of course with it
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:26.880]  being a closed secretive session they will be able to release this I guess
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:31.480]  whenever and however they wish let's go to Jakari Jackson in Ferguson, Missouri
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:37.440]  right now. How you doing David? Jakari Jackson reporting from Clayton, Missouri.
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:45.760]  No I don't hear that but still you haven't heard any details as to what the
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:50.000]  decision has been only that they have reached a decision is that correct? Yes
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.120]  it was reported by CNN I think just a few minutes ago that they had reached the
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:57.720]  decision but like you said they're still stringing us along to find out exactly
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:00.840]  what that is so hopefully it'd be sometime in the near future hopefully it
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:04.080]  happened while we're live on the show but meanwhile you can see the
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:08.280]  surroundings around us we've done some reports over the past couple days showing
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:12.200]  you guys outside the Justice Center you can see all the media trucks a heavy
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:15.320]  police presence out here today this is the largest police presence we've seen
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:18.880]  in this location since we started our broadcast and also they have all the
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:22.160]  barricades and all the things going on over here to the other side of the
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:26.040]  screen. I'll talk a little bit about before we get to the Darren Wilson
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:29.680]  verdict some of the things have been going on in and around the St. Louis area
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:33.280]  last night we went out to another march another peaceful March I think the only
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:36.800]  entry to report was a journalist got hit in the head with the rock I believe it
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:41.840]  was but we marched peacefully with a group of about a thousand people for
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:46.440]  about an hour in Shaw, Missouri which is a little bit south of here and it's good
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:49.480]  you know they do the shut down the streets the shut it down for Michael
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:52.840]  Brown as they call it they go into an intersection and they shut it down for
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:56.000]  four minutes symbolizing the four minutes that Michael Brown are seen to
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.520]  four hours that Michael Brown was left just dead on the road to bleed out
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:04.760]  without any chance of being revived so they've been doing that in the police
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:08.280]  last night were very well-behaved I think they've learned the lesson they've
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:11.760]  had plenty of mistakes to learn from they're staying two or three blocks in
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:15.120]  front of protesters they would block off traffic about four minutes or whatever
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:18.480]  it was so they could shut down a protest and then they would continue on with the
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:22.880]  March so it's very peaceful minus the guy who got hit with a rock everybody out
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:26.160]  there was in good spirits and they keep hiding this up as it's going to be some
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.360]  huge violent thing is there a chance for violence yes there is but the majority
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:33.720]  of the people I've met out here don't want anything like that they think if
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:36.920]  there is going to be violence it's going to be outside agitators and other
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:40.280]  people who come in who just take advantage of the situation but the
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:44.160]  people in Ferguson the people here in Clayton nobody really wants that to
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:47.480]  happen everybody's just preparing for the worst you know it's hope for the best
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:51.280]  but prepare prepare for the worst well you know Chikari there was also this
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:54.720]  report that we have up on info wars.com besides the March that you just
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:57.720]  mentioned about a reporter getting hit in the head there was also a report that
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:02.760]  a journalist was arrested the police say that he was standing in the street yet
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:07.080]  they have witnesses multiple witnesses came forward disputed that claim they
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:11.760]  had photos and videos showing that he was taking photos from the sidewalk is
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:16.200]  this similar tactic or is it maybe the same incident that you guys were talking
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:19.760]  about a couple of nights ago where the police are one we were we were there
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.960]  that night it was in the night that happened the police were much better
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:28.120]  behaved I can't say they acted perfectly but they had a different guy in charge
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:32.240]  he had the guys pretty calm pretty collected and then they were standing
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:36.480]  from the police station but they went inside the firehouse around and down the
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:40.880]  block to address some people who were standing in the street just a block down
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:44.680]  the road so they get there they tell all the journalists all the protesters that
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:49.000]  they cannot stand on that side of the street I myself I was across the street
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.120]  I didn't get the best of you one of our viewers told me that you can kind of see
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:55.840]  in the corner of one of my videos but I think Joe captured it pretty well at
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:59.360]  least when they cuffed a guy and we're walking him into the firehouse so you
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:02.480]  guys can go watch those videos for yourself but it's my understanding that
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:07.400]  yes the journalist was not impeding the flow of traffic or anything else and
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:11.760]  Joe was telling me that one of the officers was just doing what he has
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:14.440]  told to do what we've been hearing that through social media we can't confirm
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:17.400]  that one way the other but people are claiming on social media that one the
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:21.200]  officers had a volunteer the statement to somebody off-camera I guess that he
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:24.480]  was just doing that he was what he was told to do to target this particular
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:27.880]  journalist that's why they haven't targeted us and we hope that trend
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:31.680]  continues but I don't think they want the media fear that goes along with a
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:37.520]  resting a lawful reporter standing on the sidewalk legally photographing so
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:41.520]  let me ask you just got better with the police will go ahead Dave let me ask you
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:45.520]  if the people there you said a lot of them seem to be knowledgeable that that
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:49.800]  is an issue that is bigger than race has anybody been talking about the
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:54.480]  situation in Ohio where of course there was that guy in Walmart someone called
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:59.160]  9-11 and said he was waving a gun wildly around in Walmart he was actually
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:03.520]  carrying a BB gun that he was going to purchase from Walmart he was carrying
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:08.720]  that with him the police showed up and just shot him down and then the police
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:14.080]  nothing no action was taken against the police that shot him we see that there
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:16.920]  really hasn't been a whole lot of protests going on there there's been
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:20.800]  some protests from student groups from an open carry group but now the mantle
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:25.480]  of protest there seems to be strictly anonymous protesters showing up there's
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:30.160]  a great picture murder is wrong even when the murderer wears blue so they're
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:34.840]  calling on that police officer to be fired or at the very least disarmed no
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:40.880]  action was taken against that police officer there in Ohio is there any any
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:44.000]  understanding or any connection in the minds of the people there at Ferguson
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.840]  to some of these other cases because clearly that was a case of to me that
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:52.760]  was much more clear-cut in terms of overreach and excessive violence of
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:56.640]  the police yes people are aware of things going on in other parts of the
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:00.160]  country of course the latest thing that happened in New York and also the the
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:03.440]  young man who had the BB gun so you know they'll come out and all chant the
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:06.640]  names of these other people not just Michael Brown but also people other
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:09.520]  people here in the St. Louis area and around the country as well so they're
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:15.080]  very aware and cognizant of the things that are going on but why we don't have
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:18.360]  larger protests larger demonstrations for those things I don't really know I'm
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:22.360]  not exactly sure how it happened that this is the issue that people decided to
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:26.800]  focus on you know they've been media about these other events as well but
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:30.460]  this was the kind of the catalyst that got everybody together to focus on the
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:34.480]  situation like you said you know there's a lot of things that they're keeping
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:38.200]  from us as far as the particulars of this trial but the things you mentioned
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:43.160]  the Walmart shooting the guy who got shot in New York in the stairwell there
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:46.360]  are other more definitely clear-cut examples but why I came to this I'm not
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.240]  exactly sure well of course it seems like to me that there's a lot of people
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:56.440]  in the conservative community people who would have kind of a knee-jerk reaction
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:01.360]  to defend law enforcement first and foremost and and not really look very
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:05.800]  closely at particular incidents it seems like they also are the same kind of
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:10.600]  people who are going to not be persuaded by demonstrations actually I think it's
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:14.800]  going to kind of backfire against those people when they see a massive group of
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:18.280]  people carrying signs and shutting down intersections that sort of thing it's
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:22.160]  going to make them it's going to push them further into the camp of saying
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:25.000]  yeah we need to have even more law enforcement don't we to kind of shut
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.440]  this stuff down maybe there's other ways that we need to reach those people
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:33.800]  well the thing about it is David you know whether it's police actions or
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:37.040]  military actions they think if you're wearing a uniform a lot of people
[02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:41.200]  anything you do is you know on the up and up but it's not the case you know we've
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:45.200]  seen some horrific things done in the war theaters we see the perfect things
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:48.600]  done on our streets here in America you know growing the opium overseas all
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:52.320]  kinds of things going on so I'm not one of those people who think you know just
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:56.440]  because you're a uniform everything you do is in the right yeah so but there are
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:00.080]  people who think that way you know I think you that whether the guy that got
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:04.560]  shot in the the stairwell in New York or some of these other instances well the
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:08.560]  officer pulled out a gun they think these officers these highly trained you
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:12.880]  know James Bond type of guys they're the master of every situation they can show
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:16.400]  up they have perfect aim they can do all these things but it's not the case these
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:20.320]  guys don't have very good training and the training they do get you know it's
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:24.560]  this federalized training you know these are very harsh brutal tactics you know
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:28.400]  and since we've been out here the second time from our original trip in August
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:32.120]  they have gotten a lot better but there's still a lot of work to be done
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:35.560]  well and of course it's the same sort of thing we saw in the story we covered
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:39.960]  last week coming out of the Albuquerque police department the police
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:45.880]  department that has the highest percentage of shootings per capita far
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:51.760]  greater than large cities like New York and again after they've been under the
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:55.120]  special scrutiny of the Department of Justice because so many people have
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:00.440]  complained about them they still come out with a Killology class and essentially
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:04.960]  training them that they're in a war zone essentially telling them you are in a
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:08.680]  war and you are a warrior there are people who wake up every morning
[02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:13.840]  determined to send your family to a box that's the kind of mindset that causes
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:17.920]  this to happen and of course we saw earlier in that same area in Albuquerque
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:21.560]  that that's where they shot the homeless man that was up in the hills earlier
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:26.400]  this year we also saw that they had instituted what one person at the New
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:30.560]  Mexico police an instructor the New Mexico Police Academy said was a shoot
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:34.720]  first curriculum he refused this veteran instructor at the police academy
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:39.960]  refused to teach that curriculum calling it a shoot first curriculum and they
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:43.960]  fired him because of it they were not going to change the curriculum so we
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:50.040]  see this being pushed and yet there's so many people I think that are still
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:55.840]  just mindlessly supporting anything that law enforcement does not concerned
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:00.840]  about establishing some outside oversight or some rules of engagement I
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:04.400]  think those people need to be reached there's a number of ways we can reach
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:08.680]  people I've heard callers call in they're concerned they don't feel like
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:12.440]  we're making a headway but I do believe that we are making headway in the
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:17.280]  information war I think demonstrations are a part of it they will appeal and
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:21.600]  change the minds of some people other people we're going to need a more
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:25.800]  rational approach they're going to need to see these incidents as people
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:30.480]  videotape them on their phones and put them up on on the internet I think that
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:35.160]  will help a lot of people I think that is the way yeah we think about the guy
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:38.520]  who's got strapped down how the no refusal blood draws you know that's a
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:43.120]  very yes I think that helps wake people up yes absolutely all right we're going
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:48.320]  to be right back and I guess we're going to get some input from Joe Biggs also on
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:51.480]  the scene there Ferguson Missouri stay with us we'll be right back thank you

[02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:57.840]  there
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:21.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're going to go to
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:26.360]  one of our reporters in Ferguson Missouri right now Joe Biggs Joe are you
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:29.320]  and David we're at once again we're outside the Justice Center in Clayton
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:32.480]  Missouri and like you can understand right now tensions are pretty high
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:36.000]  there's a much larger police presence today there's a lot of different
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:42.240]  security teams driving around just tensions are high for the verdict what's
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:46.600]  going to happen today everyone's just waiting to find out how to react and how
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:50.160]  to respond I mean you've got to understand this is since august and
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:55.360]  this has just been building up so much over time people have gone from kind of
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:58.600]  getting tired of it to feeling like they're being teased that the verdict
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:01.920]  was going to come out last week now here we are a week later waiting on this
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:05.280]  again so everyone's just really emotional and they just want to find out
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.320]  because like I said before that Ferguson fatigue is definitely sat in and
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:13.400]  people are just fed up and they just want to find out what's going on you
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:18.560]  know we're getting a Washington Post CNN others saying that press conferences
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:23.440]  are being prepared that the grand jury has reached a verdict they're also say
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:26.760]  in this Washington Post article that although a parallel federal civil
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:30.920]  rights investigation the shooting is continuing federal investigators have
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:35.520]  all but concluded that they don't have a case against Darren Wilson so it looks
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:39.480]  like this is going to be he's going to be found innocent they're not going to
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:44.920]  move forward with prosecution and I think of course really this this as we
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:48.920]  mentioned earlier in the program a grand jury can be used and I believe it's
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:54.440]  being used here to provide political cover for the prosecutor he could move
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:59.120]  ahead even if the grand jury said they didn't want to indict into a trial the
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:04.080]  the prosecutor still has that opportunity to do that so he's trying to get
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:08.680]  some political cover from these people what do you think in terms of the people
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:11.560]  that you've talked to the pulse that you've gotten from people as you've
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:14.160]  been there this last week what do you think is going to happen you think it's
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:21.000]  going to get violent yes you do I do you know there's more people out here who
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.880]  want peace but at the end of the day David only takes a few bad apples to
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:29.000]  really just turn everything in a complete and total chaos you know last
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:34.480]  night I got a picture from an area in Shaw where people said they want to
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:39.960]  burn it down so like I said tensions are very high you know you've got 90% of the
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:43.600]  people out there just super peaceful loving people who just want to go out
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:46.360]  there and have their voices be heard but you're going to have some out there
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:50.800]  who really want nothing more than to start some chaos release anger in any
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:53.920]  way they can because they feel like that's the only way that they can be
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:57.960]  heard so it's one of those things that we just have to wait and sit back and
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:01.600]  find out what's going to happen and plan accordingly well in the course last time
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:06.920]  you were there you got shot with a rubber bullet you guys got gassed we saw
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:13.000]  video that you guys took where they were using laser sites to target people that
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:16.840]  were what about a hundred yards away or so I mean they were no immediate threat
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:21.120]  to the people yet they were they clearly had their guns and sights pointed on
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:25.240]  them so I mean there's there's two sides to this as well do you see any how do
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:29.440]  you feel you believe that of course all it takes is like you said it's just a
[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:33.920]  few agitators they could be false flag agitators or whatever what is your take
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:37.040]  in terms of the police you guys have said that they seem to be more
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:41.160]  professional this time yes the lieutenant that was there at the
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:44.960]  Ferguson Police Department that came in the other night he was very professional
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:50.600]  had very great leadership skills and really led the the officers there that
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:56.400]  that night in a responsible manner they they did everything right yeah there
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:59.320]  were arrests made there were some people who purposely I don't think they
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:02.640]  minded being arrest arrested they just that they stood there right there in the
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:05.480]  middle of the road but a lot of people are saying hey you know we're worried
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:09.560]  about the MRAPS again you know we don't want to have our our children in the
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:13.520]  neighborhood have these laser dots on their chest because some guy is pointing
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:17.600]  a sniper rifle at him you know it the way things handled were handled in
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:21.680]  August it makes a lot of people worried now is that gonna happen again so
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:27.480]  everyone is kind of on pins and needles because when this verdict comes out you
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:32.240]  can tell every the governments they're preparing for the worst they're
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:37.880]  expecting massive riots they're expecting hell to break loose so everyone
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:41.600]  sitting here waiting including myself are they gonna come out here again arrest
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:45.680]  journalists shooted journalists are they going to come out here in full battle
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:50.480]  rattle in these MRAPS and tanks and all this stuff I just hope it doesn't get to
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:54.720]  that point again but you know they're sending a hundred FBI agents they've
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:58.160]  already done that they've got a thousand police officers in the area that's
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:03.120]  almost more than we have in Iraq so it just it it's pretty amazing when you
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:07.280]  look at the number of people they have here for something so it's it's very
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:10.720]  interesting to watch that now I can tell from looking at you that it is freezing
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:15.080]  cold there what's the temperature there oh it's it's below freezing and the wind
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:19.400]  is blowing extremely hard wow and you're standing in front of what is that the
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:23.080]  court building or is that the police station the Justice Center this is where
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:26.160]  apparently they're convening right now and as you can see they've had this
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:30.920]  place barricaded off now for about two days in anticipation for the verdict and
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:33.800]  like I said there's a lot of police officers out here today there's vehicles
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:37.400]  parked around every corner you know they're not taking this lightly they've
[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:41.040]  got you know all the mainstream media big wigs who have you watched all right

[02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:43.860]  you are the Resistance.
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:46.860]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:47.860 --> 02:33:48.860]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:48.860 --> 02:33:50.860]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[02:33:50.860 --> 02:33:55.860]  We've just been talking to our reporters in Ferguson, Missouri, Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs.
[02:33:55.860 --> 02:34:02.860]  Now tonight we have the Infowars Nightly News that starts at 7 Central, 8 Eastern.
[02:34:02.860 --> 02:34:05.860]  You'll see that on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:05.860 --> 02:34:09.860]  And of course if you have a subscription, that helps to support our operation.
[02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:11.860]  That helps us to send reporters there.
[02:34:11.860 --> 02:34:13.860]  Tonight it will likely be live.
[02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:18.860]  We'll be having live updates from our reporters there, Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs.
[02:34:18.860 --> 02:34:23.860]  They'll be getting the reactions, hopefully the peaceful reactions of people to this verdict.
[02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:29.860]  It looks like the verdict is going to not result in the prosecution of the police officer.
[02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:33.860]  A lot of people there are angry about that, are going to be angry about that.
[02:34:33.860 --> 02:34:36.860]  So it remains to be seen if that's going to be a peaceful protest, what's going to happen.
[02:34:36.860 --> 02:34:41.860]  So they'll be there talking to people, they'll be covering it if it breaks out into something that is violent.
[02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:44.860]  Again, that will be tonight at 7 Central, 8 PM Eastern.
[02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:47.860]  The Infowars Nightly News on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:51.860]  Your subscription can be shared with up to 20 people now.
[02:34:51.860 --> 02:34:53.860]  Alex has extended that.
[02:34:53.860 --> 02:35:00.860]  Can be watching the news live, supporting our operation, having access to all of Alex Jones' documentaries.
[02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:05.860]  As we were just talking about in the last segment, a lot of people aren't going to have their minds changed
[02:35:05.860 --> 02:35:09.860]  by people demonstrating in the streets and shutting down roads.
[02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:15.860]  There's also a lot to be done in the information war, a lot of background that people need to understand.
[02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:18.860]  And of course, you're going to get that with those documentaries.
[02:35:18.860 --> 02:35:23.860]  That's one of the best ways to wake people up, to give them a broad perspective,
[02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:26.860]  to give them the background to understand what's going on.
[02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:32.860]  And then every night we give you what's happening with the Nightly News, a recap at 7 Central, 8 PM Eastern.
[02:35:32.860 --> 02:35:38.860]  Now also, we have Silver Bullet is back in stock, but of course, as usual, it is a limited supply.
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:42.860]  Once it runs out, it's going to take at least six weeks for us to get more in,
[02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:47.860]  because it's very difficult and dangerous for us to make it in these higher concentrations.
[02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:51.860]  It's 30 parts per million and a pure base of deionized water.
[02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:55.860]  It is free of toxic artificial additives right now.
[02:35:55.860 --> 02:36:00.860]  There's never been a more important time for you to have a powerful, clean form of colloidal silver
[02:36:00.860 --> 02:36:02.860]  within your reach for you and for your family.
[02:36:02.860 --> 02:36:11.860]  Go to infowarslife.com to order your Silver Bullet now, or call 1-800-1888-253-3139.
[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:15.860]  That number again is 888-253-3139.
[02:36:15.860 --> 02:36:17.860]  That also supports our operation.
[02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:19.860]  I want to go back to our phone calls.
[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:24.860]  We had a lot of people calling in about immigration, about Ferguson, about the reports we had
[02:36:24.860 --> 02:36:32.860]  of what happened to homeschoolers, as well as the pedophile ring that is starting to gradually be exposed in Britain
[02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:37.860]  after 30 years of cover-up from those who are in positions of authority
[02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:41.860]  inside the highest levels of government, inside the highest levels of Scotland Yard,
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:44.860]  and the BBC that's gradually starting to come out.
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:48.860]  Let's go to Dan in Michigan. Dan?
[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:50.860]  Hi, Mr. Knight. How are you doing?
[02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:52.860]  Hi, doing good. You're on. What's up?
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:54.860]  What do you want to talk about?
[02:36:54.860 --> 02:37:00.860]  I thought it would be interesting for a group like you guys to make some instructional style videos
[02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:08.860]  to reenact some of the previous shootings, but flip the races, or make the cop, not a cop, and bike versa,
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:11.860]  just to throw out some cognitive dissonance.
[02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:13.860]  Yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:16.860]  This is something to be said about having a reenactment, isn't it?
[02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:21.860]  I remember a very powerful documentary several years ago, decades ago, actually,
[02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:28.860]  came out in the 80s. It's called A Thin Blue Line, and it was a documentary done by Earl Morris.
[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:32.860]  I think he won Academy Award for it, but basically it was a guy who was on death row,
[02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:36.860]  and he went back and interviewed him and a lot of other people.
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:42.860]  In the course of the documentary, he was actually able to get a confession from the real killer,
[02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:47.860]  and he was on death row. This is a guy who I believe was a drifter, or he was homeless,
[02:37:47.860 --> 02:37:52.860]  and the police picked him up. It was the death of a police officer,
[02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:57.860]  and they were definitely going to get somebody to pay for that crime, but they picked the wrong person.
[02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:04.860]  But that documentary, the reason that rung a bell was because that documentary used live reenactments,
[02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:09.860]  and they had multiple people's stories told some of them true, some of them not true,
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:14.860]  and what he did was he reenacted each of these persons' testimony,
[02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:18.860]  and you could kind of see the conflict in it as well. It's very interesting documentary,
[02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:21.860]  but there's a lot of power to be had in a reenactment. Go ahead.
[02:38:21.860 --> 02:38:23.860]  Was there something else you wanted to say?
[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:29.860]  Yeah, one more point. I wanted to call in a long time ago and say this, but I think it's important now, too.
[02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:36.860]  I think you guys could do like a highlighting police officer who's very constitutionally minded,
[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:40.860]  because we have so many villains out there right now, everybody's hating on the police,
[02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:44.860]  and there's a lot out there that do a lot of good and believe in constitution and liberty.
[02:38:44.860 --> 02:38:52.860]  That you guys could just do like one a week or one a month just highlighting somebody with a police officer or something like that.
[02:38:52.860 --> 02:38:57.860]  That's true. We've done that in the past. There was that police officer that was in upstate New York
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:03.860]  that stood up for constitutional rights of protesters on that opt-out and film weekend, if you remember that.
[02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:08.860]  Stan Lenick, we've talked to him. We've also talked to Shane Harger,
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:12.860]  a constitutional police officer, a police commissioner.
[02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:19.860]  Actually, I think he was the chief of police was actually his title, and he got, again, it was a TSA.
[02:39:19.860 --> 02:39:23.860]  They're in the kind of the front lines of tyranny, aren't they?
[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:29.860]  But basically, as they pushed back against him at an airport, he pushed back against them.
[02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:33.860]  They got him fired. They eventually got him indicted as we're talking about grand juries.
[02:39:33.860 --> 02:39:36.860]  It's very easy to get anyone indicted for anything.
[02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:41.860]  We've tried to highlight people who are concerned, who are constitutional sheriffs and peace officers,
[02:39:41.860 --> 02:39:45.860]  and there are people out there, as Frank Serpico talks about them.
[02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:48.860]  He calls them not whistleblowers, but lamp lighters.
[02:39:48.860 --> 02:39:54.860]  I think that's a really good way to put it. People who expose it, people who are not going to go along with the crowd.
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:39:59.860]  And there's a lot of police officers out there. They come under a lot of pressure.
[02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:02.860]  Usually, the system comes back against them.
[02:40:02.860 --> 02:40:07.860]  We've got with Adrian Schoolcraft that is working its way through the system now in New York City.
[02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:14.860]  We just had an analyst with the city of New York talk about how they had whitewashed and fudged the numbers.
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:21.860]  I guess we should call it grubbering the numbers on a report that talked about excessive police violence in New York.
[02:40:21.860 --> 02:40:27.860]  So we have tried to reach out as we become aware of police officers who are speaking out.
[02:40:27.860 --> 02:40:35.860]  Just like we talk about citizens, if they don't get concerned enough to do something to try to get control of their government
[02:40:35.860 --> 02:40:40.860]  when the government does something wrong, the same thing is certainly true of people who are police officers.
[02:40:40.860 --> 02:40:47.860]  If you don't speak out, if you remain quiet, if you become part of a group rather than to stand up for your principles,
[02:40:47.860 --> 02:40:50.860]  then you're part of the problem as well.
[02:40:50.860 --> 02:40:57.860]  We always try to highlight people who are blowing the whistle or who are lighting the lamps and shining light
[02:40:57.860 --> 02:41:00.860]  on what's being done that shouldn't be done.
[02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:06.860]  Let's go to Richard in Arizona. Richard?
[02:41:06.860 --> 02:41:08.860]  Yes, David, can you hear me?
[02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:09.860]  Yes, I hear you. Go ahead.
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:14.860]  Okay, I want to make three real quick comments on the police incidents that you brought up this morning.
[02:41:14.860 --> 02:41:21.860]  I agree with the last caller that the good police needed a lot of support and I tremendously appreciate them.
[02:41:21.860 --> 02:41:26.860]  One of the ways that we need to keep the police purist to get rid of the bad ones immediately,
[02:41:26.860 --> 02:41:31.860]  and I want to mention what normal responses would have been to these three incidents.
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:35.860]  The first one with the guy that got killed on the stairwell,
[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:40.860]  that policeman, maybe and maybe not the other policeman that he was with,
[02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:46.860]  should be in prison waiting to see if he's going to get off lightly with life in prison or not.
[02:41:46.860 --> 02:41:51.860]  The second one, and not wondering whether he's going to get fired or something along that path.
[02:41:51.860 --> 02:41:53.860]  Not unpaid leave.
[02:41:53.860 --> 02:41:59.860]  No, crimes under color of law should be more serious than the same crime by a citizen.
[02:41:59.860 --> 02:42:04.860]  I agree. That's a very good point. They should be taken more seriously. Yes, go ahead.
[02:42:04.860 --> 02:42:09.860]  Absolutely. Now, the second one is the Walmart incident with the BB gun.
[02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:15.860]  Again, that should be in deciding the process right now, whether it's first degree murder or just manslaughter.
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:17.860]  And the person should not be out on bail.
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:20.860]  They should be in prison waiting for that determination and trial.
[02:42:20.860 --> 02:42:27.860]  And the third one with the homeschool invasion with the people accused of having a dirty house.
[02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:36.860]  Those guys are terrorists and they should be held under the strictest anti-terrorism laws right now that we have or that we can get.
[02:42:36.860 --> 02:42:41.860]  And that's a proper application of anti-terrorist laws in my opinion.
[02:42:41.860 --> 02:42:46.860]  I agree. Now, the case in the middle, the fellow who was killed in Walmart.
[02:42:46.860 --> 02:42:52.860]  And of course, there was someone else who was there who died of a heart attack, scared to death, literally scared to death.
[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:59.860]  In that particular case, they have refused to prosecute that officer, Sean Williams, in Ohio.
[02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:04.860]  So that's why Anonymous is strongly protesting that.
[02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:15.860]  As you pointed out, it's really incumbent upon police officers to stand up because I believe if they don't, there's going to be a pendulum swinging in the other way.
[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:24.860]  And perhaps so far in the other way that it's going to put rules on them where they would not be allowed to use legitimate force to protect themselves in a case where it is warranted.
[02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:30.860]  So I think it's very important, as you point out, that we see that justice is being served.
[02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:34.860]  We need to see that there's some outside, oversight, as Frank Serpico has said.
[02:43:34.860 --> 02:43:40.860]  And we need to understand that people who commit crimes, like the execution of this man, I don't know why they did it.
[02:43:40.860 --> 02:43:43.860]  I don't understand what their motivations were. Frankly, I don't care.
[02:43:43.860 --> 02:43:47.860]  I don't care what their motivations were. They killed a man.
[02:43:47.860 --> 02:43:49.860]  And so as you pointed out, they should be in jail.
[02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:58.860]  They should be facing a verdict that is taking it more seriously when people do this under color of law, when they use a uniform to commit crimes.
[02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:00.860]  It ought to be taken much more seriously.
[02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:02.860]  Let's go to Robert and Louisiana. Thank you, Richard.
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:04.860]  Let's go to Robert and Louisiana. Robert?
[02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:06.860]  Hey, David, how you doing today?
[02:44:06.860 --> 02:44:08.860]  Doing good. Go ahead. What's on your mind?
[02:44:08.860 --> 02:44:17.860]  Me and another family, a member of mine, were the ones who put up the InfoWars, Alex Jones, Billboards.
[02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:18.860]  Oh.
[02:44:18.860 --> 02:44:19.860]  And yeah.
[02:44:19.860 --> 02:44:20.860]  Well, thank you.
[02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:21.860]  Thank you. Great job.
[02:44:21.860 --> 02:44:34.860]  Well, look, I kind of had another idea, a promotional idea that maybe that y'all could set up some kind of a contest so we could put up more of them.
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:46.860]  You know, we could have a donation for the cause or you could have like a contest entry fee and people could send in their ideas.
[02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:55.860]  And we, you know, you could judge them and whoever wins the best ones can have their billboards put up.
[02:44:55.860 --> 02:44:58.860]  And it'd be all listeners funded.
[02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:02.860]  The listeners would fund it through donations and entries.
[02:45:02.860 --> 02:45:05.860]  That's a great idea. Thank you so much for doing that.
[02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:15.860]  I know one of the billboards I heard somebody call in last week and talked to Alex about it and run down a list before the billboards where I know one of them was in my old stomping grounds in Raleigh, North Carolina.
[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:23.860]  Where they've got, I think, an affiliate on the northeastern side that was out of range of where we live.
[02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:26.860]  Because we lived quite a bit to the west of Raleigh, actually.
[02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:29.860]  But that's a great idea. I'll pass that on.
[02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:30.860]  Thank you so much for doing that.
[02:45:30.860 --> 02:45:31.860]  And thank you for calling in.
[02:45:31.860 --> 02:45:33.860]  Robert and Louisiana.
[02:45:33.860 --> 02:45:35.860]  Was there anything else you wanted to say?
[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:36.860]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:40.860]  I just wanted to thank Steve, the ex-Navy sale that called up.
[02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:53.860]  And he also gave me some documentaries that he blew print for truth, which is about 9-11, and beyond treason, which is about what he has, the Gulf War syndrome.
[02:45:53.860 --> 02:45:57.860]  I encourage every American to look those up and watch them.
[02:45:57.860 --> 02:45:58.860]  You know, that's what we were just saying.
[02:45:58.860 --> 02:46:00.860]  It's very, very important.
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:06.860]  Documentaries are a great way to wake people up because it allows you to take the time to cover a subject in depth.
[02:46:06.860 --> 02:46:11.860]  It gives people a background. It gives them a perspective. They can see the patterns being developed.
[02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:17.860]  We go through and we talk about what's happening in the news, and we try to fill in the details and connect the dots for people.
[02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:25.860]  But there's so much stuff that's happening in the news, and we don't have time to be able to go in and rehash everything every day.
[02:46:25.860 --> 02:46:27.860]  We basically bore people to death.
[02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:32.860]  So we're basically kind of applying these things to news as it's breaking.
[02:46:32.860 --> 02:46:35.860]  So it's a great idea to go back and check those documentaries out.
[02:46:35.860 --> 02:46:41.860]  Thank you so much. Robert from Louisiana. Let's go to Alan in Georgia. Alan?
[02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:47.860]  You're doing great. I just wanted to compliment you on the past couple of days. You've been doing a great job.
[02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:50.860]  Oh, thank you. What was your comment?
[02:46:50.860 --> 02:46:56.860]  I would like to say that, you know, I think the police situation in America is more like a cancer.
[02:46:56.860 --> 02:47:01.860]  And when people say that all cops aren't bad, I think it just perpetuates.
[02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:10.860]  It almost sounds like, hey, every cell in your body is not a cancer cell. It's like, that doesn't really help to say that because it's really out of control.
[02:47:10.860 --> 02:47:15.860]  I mean, it really is out of control. I mean, in my hometown here, there's a guy named Kendrick Johnson, oh boy.
[02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:22.860]  He was wrapped up in a wrestling mat and, you know, he died at a high school at Lowndes County High School.
[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:28.860]  And they've been brushing everything under the rug. The whole case was handled, you know, completely inappropriately.
[02:47:28.860 --> 02:47:33.860]  They rolled it an accident immediately whenever it seemed like more like a homicide.
[02:47:33.860 --> 02:47:38.860]  I mean, it's just all the evidence is adding up to foul play.
[02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:44.860]  It's leading back to an FBI investigator that, you know, goes to the school and has a son who got into a fight with the boy.
[02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:51.860]  I mean, it's just, this stuff is really just in the tacitizing. I mean, it's just crazy. It's just dumb.
[02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:56.860]  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. And it's being driven from the central government as well.
[02:47:56.860 --> 02:48:01.860]  And if we look back at this, there's a lot of aspects to it. Of course, you know, we have the war on drugs,
[02:48:01.860 --> 02:48:06.860]  I think is the predominating influence as to what is breeding the violence and breeding the corruption.
[02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:12.860]  That's going on now for about 40 years. We haven't learned anything from that experience yet.
[02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:17.860]  There have been some who have. We've got law enforcement against prohibition, LEAP.
[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:25.860]  We've talked to prosecutors, a former Chicago prosecutor there, who talks about how he used to be a drug warrior,
[02:48:25.860 --> 02:48:31.860]  but then he came to realize that not only was it totally ineffective in terms of saving people from drugs,
[02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:37.860]  just as we realize alcohol prohibition was totally ineffective, but it was destroying the police force
[02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:41.860]  and it was breeding this kind of violence. But, you know, there's another aspect of it too.
[02:48:41.860 --> 02:48:48.860]  And we see that in the way the police are being used to raise revenue for local cities.
[02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:52.860]  And most of that in most areas comes from traffic violations.
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:58.860]  You know, there's a story that came out and it's now about six weeks old, but it is an amazing story.
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:04.860]  It was on Business Insider. Chicago made its yellow lights one tenth of a second shorter.
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:12.860]  And by doing that, they raked in $8 million in new tickets because it was automatically generating tickets.
[02:49:12.860 --> 02:49:18.860]  You know, the police have been used for that for quite some time, but essentially they're going to replace the police
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:26.860]  with these kind of automated responses. Once you see them monitoring the vehicle-to-vehicle communications
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:35.860]  that they are now mandating in cars, once you see insurance companies monitoring the black box that is being mandated in your car,
[02:49:35.860 --> 02:49:41.860]  you're going to see your insurance rates go up. You're going to see tickets being generated for you automatically
[02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:46.860]  because they're going to drive you out of the car as a driver.
[02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:49.860]  You're going to be in the car, but you're not going to have any control of it.
[02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:52.860]  They'll have a computer-controlled, government-controlled car.
[02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:59.860]  We're not going to need police for those kind of tickets anymore, but we're still going to have the TSA as control
[02:49:59.860 --> 02:50:02.860]  on the different modes of transportation that we have.
[02:50:02.860 --> 02:50:08.860]  We're still going to have the war on drugs or it'll be replaced by the war on terror.
[02:50:08.860 --> 02:50:11.860]  That's the thing that is the real concern.
[02:50:11.860 --> 02:50:19.860]  The fact that they're using SWAT teams no longer for drug raids, although we had many, many cases of innocent people
[02:50:19.860 --> 02:50:27.860]  being killed by SWAT raids that were ostensibly about drugs, now we see them using these kind of tactics against homeschoolers.
[02:50:27.860 --> 02:50:34.860]  We had the Department of Education using a SWAT team on a family, dragging them out in the middle of the night,
[02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:43.860]  face down on the lawn. Why? Because the mother, who no longer lived with that family, the mother was behind on her school college loans.
[02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:48.860]  That's the kind of in-your-face authoritarian government we need to shut that down.
[02:50:48.860 --> 02:50:51.860]  There are many things we need to do with that. We've got one more segment here.
[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:54.860]  I'm going to try to finish up with the people who have been waiting on the phone.
[02:50:54.860 --> 02:51:05.860]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:51:25.860 --> 02:51:28.860]  That's 800-686-2237.

[02:54:14.860 --> 02:54:24.860]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in Austin. Now we're going to have a live edition of Prison Planet TV tonight if there is a releasing of the verdict.
[02:54:24.860 --> 02:54:40.860]  We've had many news outlets quoting sources saying that the grand jury has reached a verdict in Ferguson, Missouri, but we also have some sources like the LA Times saying that they're still considering as to whether or not they're going to publicize what that verdict was today.
[02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:53.860]  If they do not publicize that, we will not be going live. But if they do, we'll have reporters in Ferguson, Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, they will be giving updates as to what's going on and the reactions of the public to the verdict.
[02:54:53.860 --> 02:55:02.860]  And that will be tonight at 7th Central, 8th Eastern on Prison Planet TV. I want to go back to your phone calls. This is our last segment. I want to try to get through as many of these as we can.
[02:55:02.860 --> 02:55:12.860]  Let's go to Mike in Pennsylvania. You had a comment about the Guccifer revelation about possible Pennsylvania nuke. Is that correct?
[02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:13.860]  Yes.
[02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:15.860]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:55:15.860 --> 02:55:26.860]  Good afternoon, David. This is Mike from FEMA Region 3. I've been doing the best I can to prep food, ammunition, air filters, water filters.
[02:55:26.860 --> 02:55:40.860]  But how can we prep against a nuclear attack? I totally feel this is something the government would do. What can we do as citizens? Where can we stand up? Who can we contact?
[02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:51.860]  Turn your radio down a little bit, but I think we did get that. What can we do? Who can we contact? Well, quite frankly, we don't know when and where something is going to happen.
[02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:58.860]  We don't know if the government is going to do a false flag, if there's going to be a terrorist event, or if maybe there's going to be some kind of a natural grid down scenario.
[02:55:58.860 --> 02:56:08.860]  I think what you just pointed out that you're doing, and that is as much as you can to prepare for your family, many of the things that you're going to be faced with, you would prepare for in the same way.
[02:56:08.860 --> 02:56:12.860]  So that's probably the best thing that you could do about it.
[02:56:12.860 --> 02:56:26.860]  As we find information specific, and again, Guccifer has a lot of credibility, in my opinion, because he has seen a lot of private correspondence going back and forth between some of the most powerful people in the world.
[02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:35.860]  And he's exposed extramarital affair, a lot of personal private business, but he's also seen the priority that they put on things like Bohemian Grove.
[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:45.860]  In other words, that there's some kind of a hidden secretive agenda, a gentleman's club, if you will, that is putting together this globalist agenda.
[02:56:45.860 --> 02:56:54.860]  And he's spoken about that, although The New York Times is not too interested in providing the details, they have dropped a couple of snippets, if only to laugh about it.
[02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:56.860]  Did you have another comment, Mike, that you wanted to make?
[02:56:56.860 --> 02:57:03.860]  That's exactly what they're doing. This is all a joke to them. They try to break us all down as conspiracy theorists.
[02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:11.860]  This is not going to happen. Look at this guy, he's a nut. But this is absolutely serious, and you guys are the only one bringing this to the forefront.
[02:57:11.860 --> 02:57:20.860]  And I'm terribly concerned about my children. I have two little boys. Who can we contact? What legislators would look into this?
[02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:28.860]  I don't think any of them have the guts, the nerve to stand up to Obama or whoever is running the show.
[02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:33.860]  That's true, and if it is some kind of a false flag situation, it's going to be highly compartmentalized.
[02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:39.860]  I mean, just look at this situation, the pedophile ring, and this being exposed now in Great Britain.
[02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:43.860]  Everybody was told it was a matter of national security. It was highly compartmentalized.
[02:57:43.860 --> 02:57:49.860]  In many cases, you had people at Scotland Yard, at the BBC, at other places in the press who were trying to expose it.
[02:57:49.860 --> 02:57:54.860]  They were shut down by the people above them. So that's the problem that we're always faced with.
[02:57:54.860 --> 02:57:59.860]  Mike and Pennsylvania, let's go to Jerry and Louisiana and try to get through as many people as we can. Go ahead, Jerry.
[02:57:59.860 --> 02:58:01.860]  It's Jerry and Indiana.
[02:58:01.860 --> 02:58:03.860]  Oh, okay, go ahead. Sorry.
[02:58:03.860 --> 02:58:12.860]  Well, I wanted to bring up a few points. I just rode into town behind a convoy of state police vehicles escorting a private company.
[02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:20.860]  Now, if I could paint you a picture there, that's how far the state police has fallen down, is that now they work for a private company.
[02:58:20.860 --> 02:58:28.860]  Yeah, absolutely. We just had a case last week where they had a police officer drop evidence rather than violate the non-disclosure agreement
[02:58:28.860 --> 02:58:35.860]  he had with Harris Semiconductor over the Stingray program. They view their loyalties to the corporations.
